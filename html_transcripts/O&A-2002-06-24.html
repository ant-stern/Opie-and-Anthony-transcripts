<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of their ratings in Buffalo and Toronto, followed by an unusually high call volume.  This transitioned into their "WOW Contest," showcasing photos submitted by female listeners. Opie and Anthony, using explicit and sexually suggestive language, critiqued the photos, focusing heavily on the contestants' bodies.  This segment also included a discussion of a photoshopped image of Black Earl, a staff member, superimposed onto a contestant's body.  Earl's subsequent violent reaction, involving the destruction of office equipment and food throwing, was detailed.  The hosts blamed co-worker Steve J for the prank, and reported numerous unsuccessful attempts to contact the increasingly agitated Earl.

A call from Wheelchair Fred followed. He graphically detailed his struggles with finding sex due to his disability and explicitly described his sexual encounters with men, emphasizing his desperation.

The show then attempted to recruit contestants for the "Stoner Spelling Bee."  The first caller, Larry, a 54-year-old Vietnam veteran, was already heavily intoxicated and boasted about his weapons (a sawed-off shotgun, a .357, and an AK-47), his marijuana use (including hash-making from pipe residue), and his use of racial slurs and misogynistic comments.  Several other callers, all identifying as marijuana users, joined the Spelling Bee, using various smoking apparatuses like bongs ("The Zong," "Mr. Bubbles") and pipes.  One female caller, Barbara, became incoherent and hung up.  Another, Jillian, participated but was eliminated.  Larry repeatedly threatened contestant Skeeter and continued his boasts of criminal activities and weapons ownership, including references to past prison sentences.  Steve, another caller, fired several guns in his backyard during the broadcast.

The "Stoner Spelling Bee" continued with other participants, including Skeeter from Jersey, Malik from Asbury Park (who also mentioned firearm ownership), Paul from Buffalo, and Joe from Framingham (identifying as half-Irish, half-black).  Joe from New Hampshire fired an AR-15 on the air.  Callers frequently interrupted each other, and the hosts did little to maintain order.  The segment was characterized by explicit language, drug references, firearm discussions, and callers firing guns on air. Mike from Cleveland ultimately won the Spelling Bee.  The segment ended with discussion regarding show lineup changes and the dismissal of Earl, following the earlier "WOW Contest" discussion and the photoshopped image incident.

Another segment revisited the "WOW Contest," with Opie and Anthony, along with a caller, Bob, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, providing sexually explicit commentary on Jennifer's appearance, specifically her breasts, suggesting reshoots with different poses and clothing (or lack thereof).  This section was filled with crude jokes, insults, and sexual innuendo.  Marlon Perkins and Jim Fowler were mentioned as potential contestants, and a geographic rivalry between New York and Philadelphia contestants was noted.  Further calls featured listener anecdotes about firearms and personal experiences, maintaining the showâ€™s vulgar and irreverent tone. The broadcast concluded with the "F.U." segment, featuring highly offensive messages from listeners.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the live version of the Opie and Anthony show for today, Monday, June, uh, I don't know, June, uh, 24th, 24th, all right.  It is the 24th day of June.  New York gets an hour of best of before we start our syndicated radio show.  Yes.  That was a fun hour of radio for New York.  It certainly was.  But now we are live for the next four hours.  A couple of phone numbers in the New York City area, 877-692-1027, outside of New York City, including Buffalo. 
[00:00:30]  Ah, Buffalo.  We got a little ratings thing for Buffalo.  Thank you.  We got a ways to go still, but we're, uh, moving in the right direction.  Yes.  Moving in the right direction.  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.  So thank you, Buffalo.  And thank you, Toronto.  Right.  We get a lot of email from Toronto because, uh, they pick up the show through, uh, BUF and Buffalo, so.  Yeah.  From Buffalo and Toronto and everyone else out there, 866-277-4WOW, 866-277-4WOW. 
[00:01:00]  That's the first.  I can't believe it.  What, what's different with today?  I can't understand.  There's something different with today because we came in to do the show and the phones are just lit like crazy.  There's phone calls waiting for us.  I don't get this.  We're not used to that.  What's different?  I don't know.  I can't figure it out.  Huh.  Usually there's not one phone line lit.  I'm not lying. 
[00:01:30]  Am I lying?  You're not lying.  We got 12.  Thank you.  They're all lit.  2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, eh, whatever.  More than 12, actually.  So, uh, really fast.  Because we don't like spending a lot of time on this.  But the WOW Contest is happening.  Ladies, you still have a chance to qualify for the WOW Contest.  We've got $5,000 up for grabs, courtesy of RiskayVideo.com.  Okay?  Now, I do what everyone else does that listens to the show.  You know, you check opianthony.com from time to time to check out the latest contestants. 
[00:02:00]  There are two more contestants up from Philly.  Yes.  Philly, stop.  Why?  Stop.  Kind of like your Phillies, stop playing.  Stop.  It's over.  What?  It's over.  You're not making the playoffs.  Your pennant run is over.  What are you saying?  Stop.  What are you saying?  We love Philly.  We love our listeners in Philly.  But I'm getting e-mail from the Philly listeners saying the same thing.  That they are embarrassed.  They are embarrassed.  Stop it.  At their representation in this WOW Contest. 
[00:02:30]  Now, why do you think that?  And Tim Sabian, he runs the station down there.  He's a very motivated man.  I know what he's doing.  He's pushing this contest hard in Philly.  Yeah.  I guarantee you that.  But they've got nothing showing up at that radio station.  Nothing.  What happened to all the girls that were in the Naughty Nighty Contest from Philly?  Some of those I'd love to see again.  You don't like their latest entries?  Awful.  I got to tell you, I'm going to be honest here.  Awful.  I'm not joking around.  This Kira girl, she loses the glasses. 
[00:03:00]  I don't know why she took the picture with the glasses on.  But she's not that bad.  It's not like a train wreck.  I don't want to ever hear, it's not that bad.  Look.  You're not that bad.  She's not that bad.  What do you think?  The Mets aren't that bad.  You never want to hear that term ever.  What do you think?  Turn it around.  I'm kind of, I'm digging her.  Dude, she's very underrated.  Yeah.  She's attractive.  I'm not even being polite either. 
[00:03:30]  I'd love to trash her.  She's kind of got a librarian look about her, but, okay, I made mistakes.  Forget about what I just said the last five minutes.  Her body's not bad.  And she's got perky.  She's got a very nice set of bread.  She's got a flat stomach.  She's a...  I think it's the glasses.  I wasn't digging the glasses.  The glasses, it kind of give her that librarian thing.  You're missing the beauty of those glasses.  If you knock them off, she can't see you to testify to you.  And glass is always good during the bukkake scene when they're just all smeared up.  It's like you're driving cross country and you hit that swarm of locusts on your windshield. 
[00:04:00]  All right, well, let me...  All right, she's okay.  Yeah, I'm digging the Kira girl from Philly.  Guarantee, though, you know what?  She's not ugly.  Yeah.  I guarantee she's not going to be in the top ten, though.  You don't think?  No.  Now, let's see the other girl.  Even with the rest of the girls?  She is cute.  I'm sorry.  I apologize to her.  I give Kira one.  Yeah.  There you go.  Let's look at Jennifer.  I think I lost my mind because of all the other messes from Philly.  Jennifer, which is the other entry from Philly. 
[00:04:30]  Turn that around.  Let me see her.  All right, Opie.  Maybe I...  Yeah, see.  Okay.  She looks like Devin.  All right.  She looks like Devin from Home Alone.  All right.  So there's one hottie and one not-so hottie.  Well, she might have some redeeming qualities.  Let me check another photo.  Perhaps that was just a bad photo.  Uh-oh.  That one looks a little grainy.  Anyway. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  No, seriously.  That's going to be Parker from Dallas.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, let me go back there.  I forgot to have my daily look at her.  Parker from Dallas?  Yeah.  So go to opandanthony.com.  The wow contest.  It's happening.  Ladies, all you have to do is show up at the station we broadcast on, and they take your  pictures.  They send them off to us, and we eventually get them up on opandanthony.com.  Eventually, we'll have some voting thing happening, okay?  A lot of people go, dude, I don't know where to vote for the best wow. 
[00:05:30]  We're not voting yet.  We're still qualifying.  Natalie.  Our goal is to get 100 women in this contest.  Yes, Anthony.  Natalie from Sacramento also.  Not bad at all.  Let me see.  Turn it around again.  I, um...  By the way, we have some very, very funny listeners out there that have taken all the  contestants from the wow contest.  Those are very nice teardrop boobs from Sacramento.  She has those nice...  Very nice.  ...shaped.  Look at the bottom side.  Very round.  Those are textbook nice boobs.  The bottom, very rounded.  The top has that slight sloping thing going on. 
[00:06:00]  The nippy is sitting at the perfect level, just above the equator line.  I think there's going to be some demerits there, though.  Four?  Ah, I know the listeners.  They're not digging the grill.  You don't want to say it?  They're not digging the grill as much.  Not digging the grill, huh?  Let me get a full-on grill look on this shot here, because I think you might be right.  They're not digging the grill.  Is that what the feedback has been on her?  See, I don't have the balls to talk for myself.  These are listeners that have emailed the show, Anthony, and I am just communicating all 
[00:06:30]  this to our fine listeners out there.  She has beautiful blue eyes.  She's cute.  She's got kind of that look of that woman that was on L.A. Law.  Remember her?  Very stern and very, like...  She's got beautiful eyes.  I think what hurt her is that she's just kind of...  Pretty?  She just kind of has a stare in those eyes, though.  A little glazed over look. 
[00:07:00]  A little glazed.  Those icy blue eyes, like she's holding a knife in her right hand.  But she took that picture.  She does look like a psycho, doesn't she?  She better not ever leave me.  I will not be ignored, Dan.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  If you guys have a problem with some of the chicken in Philadelphia, have you seen some  of the dogs from Columbus?  Is Columbus even representing in this contest yet?  Look at Raven and Sabrina.  Disgusting.  All right.  What numbers are we looking at? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Help us with numbers.  29 and 30.  29 and 30 are the Columbus representation.  Disgusting.  Okay.  Thanks, Paul.  All right.  See you.  Well, let's go to 29 and 30.  All right.  He does have a bit of a point.  Look at...  That's this line.  Oh!  She came from Columbus.  The girl that has the tattoo that...  It looks like the belly button is eating it.  And they were too scared to show their heads, so...  You do...  Oh, are they?  You do the math.  Even in the pictures?  I don't know. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I'm seeing that.  Wow.  You know, that could be Ace Frehley.  Because all I see is the hair in her jawline.  Anyway.  And that jest.  Oh, my...  I got to say, really fast, there's a...  A lot of our listeners are taking the contestants.  Yeah.  They're cutting their heads off and putting our heads on.  Oh, they certainly are.  My head, Ann's head, Jim Norton's head.  I mean, everybody associated with this show.  The only one that isn't being a good sport about this is...  You guessed it.  Black Earl. 
[00:08:30]  Opie, not only not being a good sport...  Friday night.  You should go to foundrymusic.com so you can look at some of these pictures as we talk about this.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com are unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  You can get to it also through opianthony.com.  But go ahead.  Now, all our faces have been put on various contestants for this WOW contest, and we laugh  our asses off.  Opie made one of his screensaver.  They're very funny.  The guy that's doing them is doing such a great job that it's scary to look at. 
[00:09:00]  We're all laughing, having a good time.  Well, Earl, if you look at a couple of the African princesses in our contest, maybe contestant  23, Jay, is that the one?  Or they put his face on Candy's body?  Remember Candy?  It wasn't Candy.  Was it Jay?  It was the girl that looks like the black chick from real world London.  Uh-huh.  The fat black chick.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right, her.  Jay, yeah.  Right.  From Philly.  Well, they put his face on her body. 
[00:09:30]  And then set it up as his wallpaper on his computer by his little cubicle.  Earl, well, we're hanging out Friday night after the show, having a few beers, hanging  with everybody.  Because that's what we do.  Because that's what we do.  It's all we do.  Hanging out like men when men were oysters.  You hear?  I hear me.  So we're all having fun hanging out.  All of a sudden, I hear a riot going on.  It's Earl getting back from whatever busy thing he does. 
[00:10:00]  The sticker stop.  He goes back to his cubicle, sees this wallpaper, sees his face on this chick's body.  Loses his mind.  He beats up his computer with the mouse.  He picks the mouse up by the cord and starts whacking the keyboard of his computer.  Losing his mind.  Good thing it wasn't luggage you would have jumped on.  And some Samsonite luggage.  So he's losing his mind.  He starts throwing stuff at Garrett.  Garrett? 
[00:10:30]  Hello.  Did you witness this?  I was right across from his cubicle.  He then threw a bottle of water at your head.  No, no, no.  Not at me.  He threw it so hard that it bounced off a wall and landed in front of Ron and Fez's office,  which is a good 25.  Down the hall.  Then he goes, you guys better effing get this off my effing computer.  So Garrett goes over to get it off his computer and starts laughing because Earl had broken  his mouse apart so we couldn't get it off his computer. 
[00:11:00]  He gets so pissed he picked up.  He had a salad in a Tupperware thing covered with dressing, Italian dressing.  He picked it up and threw it at the microwave oven and just salad stuck to the walls, the microwave oven.  So we start taking pictures of it.  He lost his mind.  Then he goes into Garrett's computer, rips the mouse out of the computer, starts beating  up his stuff, and then locks the mouse up in his drawer.  Like, that's going to get him.  That'll get him.  And all I kept thinking is, it took two days.  Of him being back on the show.  Two days. 
[00:11:30]  Remember when Earl said he's not doing our show anymore and he didn't?  But then he slowly got back and he did two sticker stops for us and that's it.  This morning I hear he said, today I either get fired or I'm quitting.  Why?  So is he around?  He has nothing to say.  I would just like to have Earl come into the studio here and talk to him about this because  everyone else had a pretty good sense of humor about it.  Does he know who did it?  Oh, he knows.  And who did it?  Our own Steve J.  I did it.  And he doesn't have the balls to take you down. 
[00:12:00]  No.  I fessed up to him early this morning.  I said, Earl, look, I'm sorry you felt the need to take everything out on Stinky, but I  did it, okay?  And there was no need.  But what's the big deal?  No, we all have our hands on him.  I know.  He had some kind of huge problem with it.  We all.  We all have a huge problem with it.  There's one of Rich Voss on one of the girls that makes it look like Rich Voss is a naked  female midget.  It is hilarious.  That could just be a regular shot of great stuff.  But he's the only one that has a problem with it.  Not only a problem, a huge problem where he was throwing stuff around and wanted to 
[00:12:30]  kill people.  All right, Earl's probably listening down the hall.  Earl, just give the show a call.  Earl, just come in.  Maybe someone could go down the hall.  No, because as soon as you say that, he leaves the building.  We just did.  He's sitting down there soaking.  Earl, we're not going to force you to come into the studio today like we usually do.  I hear tell also.  Just call the hotline and we'll discuss this.  I hear tell also.  You know how the lineup here at WNEW in New York has been getting thrown around like  crazy and there's been little spots opening up and maybe an hour here is available for 
[00:13:00]  certain things.  Well, there was something.  Was it the weekend that they're playing that?  What the hell are they playing on the weekend?  TV guys or something?  TV couch potatoes?  Yeah, couch potatoes.  Couch potatoes.  The couch potatoes?  The couch potatoes is some program that I've never heard of it.  Oh, God.  I never heard of it.  I haven't heard it, but it takes up some time here on the weekends.  Better than infomercials?  Yeah.  That's what they're figuring.  Better than playing an hour show about hemorrhoid cream?  Right. 
[00:13:30]  So Earl loses his mind that he didn't get the slot for his Black Rock Coalition show.  Is that a...  Oh, it's Ben at Earl's desk.  Ben.  Ben is a brave man.  Ben.  Hey, guys.  I'm down here at Earl's desk.  Hello, Earl.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, buddy.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, cold.  Oh, cold.  Oh, cold.  Oh, cold.  Oh, cold.  Oh, cold.  Oh, cold.  Oh, cold.  Oh, cold.  Oh, cold.  Oh, cold.  Earl just said Billy Club and said swing.  I see him swinging Billy Club.  Holy cow. 
[00:14:00]  Steve Brandi now.  Steve's here.  Swinging a Billy Club.  He's swinging a Billy Club at me.  Jeremy had to come out of his office and warn Earl to stop.  All right.  What's wrong with him?  I don't know.  He goes, give me the phone.  Give me the phone.  It's Steve's brand new phone.  I don't know if he can get the phone.  Then he picked up the Billy Club and started swinging at me and chased me.  Could, could, uh, we need to talk to him.  Yeah, we got to talk to him.  There, uh, well, let Steve try and get him.  All right.  He's a lot bigger than me.  All right.  Yeah.  Steve.  All right. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Just tell Earl.  We're not going to yell at him.  We're not going to make fun of him.  We just want to know what's wrong with him.  Hey, Earl.  Earl.  No one's going to yell at you.  They just want to know what's wrong.  He's not.  He's not paying.  He's sitting at his computer scrolling the Internet.  He's not even making eye contact.  Earl.  Earl.  He has nothing to say.  Nothing to say.  You heard that.  He has nothing to say, but we have something to ask him.  They have something to ask you.  Here.  Listen.  Earl.  How you doing?  What was the problem with the, uh, Earl? 
[00:15:00]  Earl?  The phone's up to his ear, so.  Yeah.  Ben, what happened?  Hold on a sec.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, Steve.  I went down there, and I dialed you guys, and I walked over to his desk where as you picked  me up, I said, Earl, I want to talk to you.  He goes, give me the phone.  He reached for the phone, then picked up the Billy Club, and almost hit me over the  head with it.  And then Jeremy came right out of his office and said, Earl, stop right now.  And he rubbed his head and went back to his desk.  That's what Earl does.  He rubs his head like that.  Calming effect. 
[00:15:30]  I've never seen Earl that pissed.  But why is he mad?  He wanted to take and smash the phone.  You've got to take the paintbrush and tickle his chin with it like Curly on the Three Stooges.  Or was it Shemp?  Remember when he got all aggravated, you had to take the paintbrush and rub his chin?  Maybe that'll work.  I don't understand.  In the past, we've done things with Earl where he doesn't feel like he's part of the  team and stuff, okay?  So I can see where maybe he's bothered and is really pissed off.  This is something that everyone has had done to them.  Stinky's head is on a bunch of the naked chicks. 
[00:16:00]  And we laugh, right?  And we're all laughing.  And we're really, really funny.  So what is his problem?  He's the only one that can't handle this for some reason.  Earl?  Earl?  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'll put him back on the phone.  I knew it would end up like this.  I just didn't think it would be so soon.  Earl?  Earl?  What's...  If you break my phone, I will smash you.  Earl?  No, he doesn't want to talk.  Was he ready to break your phone?  I'll do it.  I'd crack him over his friggin' head if he broke my phone.  I'll smash you.  You don't want to get Steve mad. 
[00:16:30]  No, no.  Not Steve.  It was like a Marvel comic book line.  Smash.  Crash.  Bang.  Steve was a bouncer on Lansdowne Street for many years.  You don't want to mess with Steve ever.  Ever.  Big guy.  Plus, he's just not right in the brain.  Well, Opie...  He's an alcoholic.  He's 0 for 2.  He's an alcoholic.  He passed out last night because he decided, like, martinis and what?  What did you...  Margaritas and what?  I had a margarita and a cold pill.  And I woke up at 3 a.m. on the floor.  Well, he had his stomach stapled. 
[00:17:00]  So he doesn't have a lot of stomach room.  He needs to take small portions.  Oh, how cute.  So he ends up on the floor.  Did you have your blankie over you?  No, no.  I'll turn nighttime cold medicine and doze off.  Were you drooling?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just don't know how I got on the floor.  The same thing happened this weekend.  I spent the weekend over at my sister's house with my brother-in-law, Rock and Roll Johnny  Race.  Rock and Roll.  Rock and Roll.  So we were down in his basement, you know, listening to old... 
[00:17:30]  What the hell music did he have on?  Goddamn.  Old Kiss music and, like, you know, the stuff he loves.  It's all on vinyl.  T-Rex.  He's got to tell you everything about it.  Yeah.  And he was hammered, where he's like, and then let me tell you, it was great.  I got, you know, Johnny Race, Rock and Roll, Race Odyssey Band, Rock and Roll, Johnny Race,  Rock and Roll.  He's just hammered.  Well, he finally goes to bed, and my sister goes, so I wake up the next morning, and Johnny  has Rock and Rolled himself onto the floor, and he's got a pillow, and he's leaning against 
[00:18:00]  the night table.  And I go, Johnny, that's my sister talking, she goes, Johnny, why are you on the floor?  He goes, Rock and Roll, I don't know.  He didn't know how he ended up on the floor.  That's great.  Why does he say Rock and Roll so much?  Rock and Roll, Johnny Race is his catchphrase.  Everyone has a catchphrase.  She says it all the time, Rock and Roll.  Everyone associated with this stupid show has a catchphrase.  He was hammered. 
[00:18:30]  Rock and Roll.  All right, well, we're not going to get to the bottom of the floor.  Oh, you got the Billy Club.  He has another one.  He has another one?  Goddamn, that state of emergency game, they handed those things out like there were toys  around here.  Hey, someone go down the hall and ask Earl to just write out a statement.  Oh, that'd be good.  In a way, that's good, because, you know, it's not like we're needling him or anything.  And if he's just scrolling through the internet, I mean, isn't Earl supposed to be doing something?  He works here, doesn't he?  Shouldn't he be doing something? 
[00:19:00]  And if he's not doing anything, shouldn't he then be doing something on this program?  That would be helping out around here.  Considering Rick's in London singing, uh-huh.  We could use the help today, so, you know, Earl's supposed to step up in these situations.  Bluto, what's up?  Hey, boys, I'm glad you're enjoying my work.  Bluto's the one putting the pictures together.  They're great, Bluto.  Wow, you're good, man.  Thanks.  That's what an unemployed graphic designer does all day.  They're hilarious. 
[00:19:30]  The one you made of Earl got him really pissed off.  Yeah, well, it was being nice.  I was going to get a picture of an ape, a banana, and some luggage, you know, and go to town.  So I might have to do that.  You are horrible.  Just stop it right now.  Hi, Bluto.  He got very angry with your work, my friend.  Oh, too bad.  Bunch it out.  Take care.  Thanks, Bluto.  And now we got rock and roll Johnny Race.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll Johnny Race.  Rock and roll, brother.  I was shaking.  Johnny, do you realize you fell asleep?  My sister said you were in the bed to start with. 
[00:20:00]  She woke up, and you were on the floor next to the bed, and you had no idea how you got there.  Oh, well, I know I had an idea.  Because I was helping Joe with the Jack Daniels, which I don't drink, and I think that got me there.  We were down in the basement.  I had four spins.  We're down in the basement, and him and my brother have a bottle of Jack Daniels.  They don't even put him in shot glasses anymore.  It's gotten to the point now where they just put the bottle back and forth like cowboys at a campfire.  And they're just like swigging him down. 
[00:20:30]  And, Johnny, you, I couldn't understand.  Maybe every fifth word that was coming out of your mouth I understood.  Oh, man, we started early, and then you got there at one, and then we started power drinking until four.  So, yeah, I'm a professional.  Well, thanks for your hospitality there, Johnny.  Hey, anytime, guys.  Let's rock and roll.  Be good.  Rock and roll.  Let's go to Dean.  Dean, what's going on?  I want to shake it in.  Shake it in.  Shake it in.  Why is Earl such a fag, man?  I don't know.  The ones that people have done putting Anthony's face on, excuse me, are the funniest. 
[00:21:00]  I'm a hot bitch, man.  I was here with the skinny one, Gemini.  You could get past the goatee.  I have nice hands.  They really are funny.  I think you guys are better off without Earl anyway.  You trim him fat, trim his fat.  All right.  Thanks, Dean.  Peace, man.  Bye.  I don't know.  There's how the show started today.  Yeah.  Earl.  Yes, John?  Oh, John has something to add to the program, John?  I went down there and tried to get Earl to write up a statement.  Yeah.  I explained to him when it was his open forum.  I'd read it verbatim, and he said, absolutely not. 
[00:21:30]  Kept scrolling up and down the Internet.  Would not even make eye contact with me.  And they have the public file, too, I do.  Whatever that is.  That's his job, and we don't even know what it is.  Will he still be appearing on the Ron and Fez show?  Of course he will.  On After Us in New York, yeah?  Of course he will.  Because I hear he's angry with them, too.  Well, then go home.  This is the easiest job in America.  Go home.  Yes, it is.  You can't take it.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hi there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:00]  Fred.  I had to call you a job.  Fred, how have you been, you bastard?  You gimpy F.  I'm trying to be.  I'm trying to be my last.  I'm confident I made.  It's wheelchair Fred.  This is an old Fred wheelchair.  Oh, my God.  He's back.  The man that Anthony tried to walk.  Five years.  To make walks.  You guys.  Five years it's been.  We're doing.  Wow, Fred. 
[00:22:30]  Well, how are you doing?  Are you out of that wheelchair yet?  By the way, this is Lady Di's replacement.  Yes, right here.  Oh, goody.  This is where we're at.  We lost Stalker Patty.  We gained Tippy Tom.  That's good.  That's a good trade right there.  We're losing Lady Di, and we're going to bring back Wheelchair Fred.  Wheelchair Fred.  Yeah, what the heck?  Fred, how is your life going?  Do you have a job?  Yeah, we're in the wild world now.  I don't know if I get to go busy on the radio. 
[00:23:00]  Wow.  You know, I'm a little rusty, Opie.  It has been many years.  We used to be able to understand Wheelchair Fred.  I really used to.  Hey, Fred.  It's Ope.  I got to tell you, you've been emailing me a bunch, and your last email really horrified  us.  I had to read it to Anthony out loud.  God, he hasn't stopped laughing since now.  Why?  Basically, you were writing this email saying that you're not gay, but you're desperate. 
[00:23:30]  Yes, I'm gay.  I'm just desperate.  All right, he's not gay, but he's just desperate.  He needs some kind of sex, is what it is.  He's a guy.  He's in a wheelchair.  He's not brain damaged.  I don't know if you believe me or not, but he's not brain damaged.  He just has a problem speaking because of the accident.  He can't walk because his legs are repped up, but his spine is fine.  And he can't get girls, but he needs sex.  So he said he doesn't care who gives it to him or what, just as long as he's got some 
[00:24:00]  flesh-to-flesh contact.  I'm not even bi.  I'm just desperate.  He said he's not bi.  He's just desperate.  So guys aren't out of the question for you, Fred.  Now, that brings up an interesting question today.  If you're in his situation, are you gay if you decide, well, I can only get a guy to  do this?  You're not physically attracted more to a guy.  I don't know.  I won't kiss a guy. 
[00:24:30]  What did he say?  What did he say?  I don't know.  I won't kiss a guy.  Oh, you won't kiss a guy?  No.  But what will you let the guy do?  Oh, I don't know.  It's about this.  What do you let him do?  Oh, I don't know.  Wow.  Hold on.  Now, Fred.  Hold on.  I don't know if they dumped out.  Do you think they dumped out of that?  No, you could say that. 
[00:25:00]  Who knows, though, with them down the hall.  You could say that, and especially when you say it like him.  Well, we got Clint, you know, just in case they didn't understand anyway.  He'll allow a guy to give him a Hummer and allow a guy to visit wheelchair Fred's back  door.  Wait a minute, Fred.  Yeah.  Are you catching or pitching?  Either and or.  Either and or.  Yeah.  So you don't care if you're getting stuck or you're doing the sticking?  What the hell does the guy look like that's doing you?  Can you get a rod? 
[00:25:30]  Well, I can't have anything.  I think so.  In about two years.  Two years ago, you had a guy visit your balloon nut?  Yeah.  What a mess.  Did it hurt you, Fred?  No.  I've been like four or five times.  Oh, Jesus.  I didn't quite catch that.  Something about feeling good.  Feeling good. 
[00:26:00]  It must.  It feels nothing good.  I must admit.  Oh, it feels good.  He must admit.  Do you have to avoid the bumps in the road on the wheelchair for the couple of days after?  No.  Because I've been like four or five times.  Oh, I got a tough butt.  What did he say?  He said something that he's got a tough butt.  And could he run cold?  All right.  Now, Fred.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How?  Well, first of all, where did you pick this guy up? 
[00:26:30]  Off the air.  Off the air, you'll tell us?  So I met him by the way off the air.  Oh, when he was on the radio.  He met him through the radio.  Oh, all right.  So you met the guy through the radio.  And where did you meet in person?  Right by a deli.  Right by my house.  By a deli by your house.  That's where you guys met. 
[00:27:00]  That's where you met.  And what did you think when you first saw him?  What did he look like?  Well, what did he look like?  Oh, he has no opinion.  Describe him a little.  You don't have to say if he was hot or something.  He was no Mohawk.  He was like 5'9".  Yeah.  I was just 4'0".  5'9", 140.  How old was he?  Did he have a Mohawk, you said? 
[00:27:30]  No.  Oh, I heard something.  He was 18.  He was 18?  Yeah.  Oh, geez, you got a kid.  Wow.  Yeah.  And was he a white guy?  What?  Was he a white guy or a black guy?  He was a white dude.  A white dude.  And what was he, Irish?  I guess so.  I don't know.  Lucky for you.  The Irish curse.  He wanted my Blarney Stone. 
[00:28:00]  He what?  He wanted my Blarney Stone.  He wanted his Blarney Stone.  All right.  Very funny.  So did you bring this kid back to your house?  Yeah.  And then what?  We were talking.  You did a little small talk, a little chit-chat.  And then we were just in the relationship.  What the hell?  And then you decided, what the hell?  It was suggested. 
[00:28:30]  At what?  It was suggested.  Oh, it was suggested.  So you said, what the hell?  And then what happened?  Wait, what was suggested first?  That you would do a little something on him or what?  I don't remember.  It was something wrong.  Well, Fred, you got to let us know how it happened.  Like, what was the first thing that happened?  The first thing that happened, he bent over as I went to town. 
[00:29:00]  He bent over and you went to town?  Yeah.  As I bent over, he went to town.  Oh, my God.  I believe in safe sex.  Well, thank God for that, you faggot.  Good thing there.  Yeah, he believed.  And then was there any stuff with the mouth? 
[00:29:30]  Not with him, no.  Not with him.  But remember, you're not gay, you're just desperate.  Right, you're just desperate.  You got it.  That's wheelchair Fred's phrase that pays.  I'm not gay.  He's not gay.  He's just desperate.  Well, all these girls are scared of me.  I believe this.  What?  All these girls are scared of me.  All the girls are scared of him.  All the girls are scared of him.  These people will just hear my voice saying, run. 
[00:30:00]  So you figure the guys...  I am not an animal.  Guys are so horny, they don't care, though, right?  Yeah, but they don't care.  All right, now, did you have to pay this guy for this?  No, I didn't pay for nothing.  Jesus Christ.  This is horrible.  Now, you had another type of date?  What did you know that I had?  You had another guy at some other point. 
[00:30:30]  How did you hook up with him?  I meant to look at the station.  All right, and then...  I want to back up, though.  Fred, we know you can't stand, so how did you get this done?  Maybe there are ways to fix the floor on that couch.  What did he say?  I don't know.  There are ways to do it.  Others' ways to do it?  What did you prop yourself up? 
[00:31:00]  I have a short individual.  And I can hold on to a bedpost, no problem.  Oh, you can hold on to a bedpost, no problem.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I have a strong tech team.  All kidding aside, it sucks to be wheelchair, Fred, because there was a time he was a motorcycle  guy, he was banging broads, right?  Oh, yeah, right.  And now he's just this desperate, pathetic guy in a wheelchair, and this is what he's 
[00:31:30]  going to do.  Can't you get a hooker, man?  Yeah, why don't you get a hooker, Fred?  He has no money.  I got no money.  The guy's broke all the time, so he's got to get free sex from guys.  I'd buy him a hooker, man.  Would you buy him a hooker?  I'm a hooker, man.  I get a book.  We'll buy you a hooker, Fred.  Oh, what the heck?  What the heck?  You should be thanking us.  Oh, thank you.  Fred, I got to ask, because you say you're not gay, you just do this because you have 
[00:32:00]  no other choice, but if you do, like, the mouth action with another guy and you're doing  it, don't you think that might be over the line of gay?  Maybe, I've only did it once.  Oh, you only did it once?  No, I did it in a kind of wheelchair.  You did it with another guy in a wheelchair?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Then I met in the Phoenix.  Then did you guys spit in each other's faces and roll down an embankment? 
[00:32:30]  No.  So you had another guy in a wheelchair, and...  I hope you can lock your wheelchair up, because as soon as you start pinning over, the wheelchair  starts going reverse.  It's rolling away.  You are.  So you had it with another guy in a wheelchair?  Yeah, I met in the Phoenix.  You had the Phoenix.  Oh, you answered an ad in the Phoenix? 
[00:33:00]  I put an ad in the Phoenix.  Oh, you put an ad in.  What did it say?  It was like two, three years ago.  Well, what did it say?  Yeah, kind of.  A guy in a wheelchair is bi, but do anything with anybody.  Wait, I think I heard him.  A guy in a wheelchair that's bi, but will do...  Anything with anybody.  Anything with anybody.  How many answers did you get to that, Fred?  Only one.  Only one.  A guy in another wheelchair. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  A guy with the hip.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  And...  I'm sorry.  People are really prejudiced against a wheelchair-bound person.  Right.  You're a person, though.  I don't really know.  You said a lot of people are prejudiced against a wheelchair-bound person.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, that's good, Jimmy.  You're picking up on this pretty quickly.  Yeah.  I'm not having to talk to you, dude.  All right.  Well, Fred, this is the first time I've talked to you in about four years, and this is good stuff. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  When are you going to get to New York?  I have no idea.  Well, start wheelchairing today.  We'll see you in October.  Or maybe some guy can get behind you.  Because I've got the money to do it myself.  Start rolling now.  You'll be to Worcester on the Mass Pike by about, I don't know, a month or two.  All right, Fred.  You're going to die.  Fred, we don't want to burn you out.  We've got a lot of catching up to do. 
[00:34:30]  So, uh, this is a good start.  Thanks for the, uh, the homo story.  You, what the heck?  All right.  All right, Fred.  Oh, but, sorry, if I can't believe I'm on any W.  Yeah, that's what we say.  All the time.  I'm on the stage as a dream.  When you, uh, when you were a biker dude, right?  What about that?  Well, when you were a biker dude, you used to listen to any W. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, and he was around.  And I'd have to ever think you'd be banging over for a guy.  Banging broads, not thinking that it would ever come to this.  Yeah, let me see one more thing.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Hi, Tom.  Sing your days at the radio.  My son, Tom.  Oh, his son.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I forgot about his son, Tom. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, how old is your son?  Sixteen.  Oh.  And you don't get to see him often, right?  Not really.  Well, he's probably not too happy about that last story.  Wait two years, you're going to meet him in front of a deli.  Don't think.  I don't think.  All right, Fred, we got a break, so it was good hearing from you.  Yeah.  All right.  Whatever.  All right.  All right, Fred, we'll be in touch.  You're a new character on the show. 
[00:36:00]  You're going to take over for Lady Di.  Oh, goody.  We just don't kick people off the show.  We replace them with new talents.  I wonder how I'll look in a G-string.  What?  I wonder how I'll look in a G-string.  Oh, he said, I wonder how I'll look in a G-string?  Yeah.  Why?  Why would you be in a G-string?  Lady Di.  Uh, because he's terrible.  You can tell a G-string. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  Well, believe me.  I think people would probably rather see you in a G-string than her.  All right, Fred.  Okay, yeah.  Just scream, I'm not an animal.  We got to go.  I'm not an animal.  What?  I'm not an animal.  That's right.  Now say, I'm a human being.  I'm not a human being.  No.  No, say, I'm not an animal.  I'm a human being.  I'm not a human being.  No.  I'm a slime ball. 
[00:37:00]  No, I'm not an animal.  I'm a human being.  Oh, sorry.  Get that animal.  I'm a human being.  Okay, no.  Fred, you got to say, I'm not an animal.  I'm a human being.  I'm not an animal.  Well, I'm wheelchair Fred, I'm a human being.  What's up?  You got to say, I'm not gay.  I'm just desperate.  That's true.  Say it. 
[00:37:30]  Say it.  Say it.  I'm not gay.  I'm just desperate.  All right.  Wheelchair Fred, everyone.  Thank you.  Thank you, Fred.  Good talking to you guys.  All right.  Good talking to you, too.  I think that's what he said.  All right, there's wheelchair Fred.  Lou from Jersey.  Jesus effing Christ, I'm selling my motorcycle immediately.  Another guy is like, if this is an excuse to wear a helmet, I don't know what else is.  I love the fact that you guys dump two girls, however awful they were, and pick up two dilapidated 
[00:38:00]  homosexuals.  The show is really heading in a great positive direction in more ways than one.  Yeah, we lose Stalker, we gain the old-fashioned faggot Tippi Tom, the homeless gay guy.  Wheelchair Fred's not gay, though.  He's just desperate.  He's just desperate.  He bent over a bed while an 18-year-old Irishman railed him.  Yes, he is.  But he's not gay.  No, not at all.  You know what?  He's just friendly.  Of course he is.  You know what it takes for him to stand up so he can do what he had to do?  Oh, he must have his arms must have been shaking as he's getting pulled. 
[00:38:30]  It would have been easier if he just, if the other guy, maybe Frank would just put on  a Santa suit and let the other guy sit in his lap while he's in the chair.  Right.  Like, I thought he would be sitting in the chair and the guy would just kind of get on  his lap or something.  But no, Frank goes the distance, hangs on to the bedpost, all shaky with his legs just  going, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just getting creamed.  Just getting nipped.  Do you want to wear a condom or let those who ride decide?  Poor guy, man. 
[00:39:00]  All right, well, that's an interesting start to the show today, huh?  All right, he's back.  Jim Brewer's supposed to stop.  Oh, he's out.  Brewer's out.  We're supposed to play Stoner Spelling Bee.  God damn it.  We can still play.  You know something?  We should play.  Stoner Spelling Bee.  Yeah, we should just play today, man.  It's a fun game.  People want to get stoned.  We need a bunch of dudes and dudettes that are smoking a lot of dope to give us a call now.  Okay. 
[00:39:30]  I want to smoke a dog.  Is that game different?  Wow.  Weird hearing him again.  A lot of fun.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  And we do it like this.  Executioners with Linkin Park is going down. 
[00:40:00]  We got a guy in a wheelchair.  He's appalled by what he heard from wheelchair Fred minutes ago.  Hey, Joe, what's going on, man?  Hey, how are you?  Hey, not bad.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, Angel.  You heard wheelchair Fred talk about how he's been in a wheelchair for many, many years.  He was in a motorcycle accident.  He's not gay, but girls are afraid of him because he talks like this. 
[00:40:30]  And he has to get sex from anybody now.  And lately, it's been with guys.  Yeah, I spoke to you guys a couple years ago.  And there's no way I'd do that.  I mean, I've been injured for 15 years.  And, you know, I'd rather get none than that.  Yeah, but see, you can talk.  So if you got a good rap and you're in the wheelchair, it doesn't really matter.  It shouldn't stop you too much.  The chicks will be like, you know, oh, okay, this is cool.  Any problems with the junk, Joe? 
[00:41:00]  No, no, no.  Everything works, man.  I have full sensation.  Oh, wow.  You're totally different than wheelchair Fred.  Yeah.  I mean, people seriously think he's retarded because his voice is shot.  Right.  And on top of it, his legs are just mangled.  They're a mess.  And then when he gets drunk, he's a drunk guy.  So he's like falling over in his chair.  He's talking even worse because now he's slurring that type of speech.  And people think he's profoundly retarded. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  And you get a lot of action, Joe?  No, no, no.  I mean, I could.  Why don't you get this guy, a fine lady?  I'd rather, like I said, I'd rather get none than have to resort to hairy man-ass.  Well, he says it's not gay, though, because he's desperate.  Well, that's fine by him.  He was 18.  How hairy could it be?  And Irish, so it's probably smooth.  Well, you'd know better than me, Jim.  I'm just speculating.  All right, Joe, thanks.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right.  Okay. 
[00:42:00]  Well, we've got to get to Stoner Spilling Bee today.  Alex, what's going on?  Hey, what's up here, buddy?  Where are you calling from?  Westchester.  In your car?  Yeah.  Bye.  Yeah.  No car phones.  No car phones, man.  We need you in your crib with a lot of dope.  What?  I feel right, man.  I thought it would be funny.  I was in Brooklyn.  I set a fire.  You are just the worst. 
[00:42:30]  You have nothing, so you're going to go that route today, you ass.  I happen to be very well prepared.  Ginger, what's going on?  Hey, brother.  Hey.  What's going on?  We're going to play the game.  All right.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from New Jersey.  Play pleasant.  And you're in your house?  No, I'm not by pool.  That ain't working either.  Why not?  Pool side?  It's outside, though.  It's outside my house.  No, your cell phone stinks.  We need people that are, like, set, man.  They're in their house.  They've got a nice phone.  I'm set.  I'm set. 
[00:43:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  How about go in and call us on a landline?  Because it'll never get through.  Hold on.  We'll call you back, maybe.  All right.  Here, Wyatt.  We don't want cell phones from outside.  We don't want people calling from their cars.  Old-fashioned, regular phone.  We want you...  Here's a guy calling from work.  Andy.  You.  How are you going to play from work?  I'm stoned at work.  Where do you work? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, I don't think I'm going to tell you that.  No, you're out, too.  Yeah.  We want to play stoner spelling bee.  Don't wreck this on us.  Here's the deal.  Now, if you're home, on a regular phone, no cordless, no cell phone, you have to have  some weed with you.  You have to have something to smoke out of.  That's it.  There are people doing that all the time.  You've got to smoke a lot of pot in the next two hours.  Amy and Steph, what's up? 
[00:44:00]  Hey, what's up?  You're in a car?  Yeah, we're coming back from Massachusetts.  It's on the turnpike, and it's hot as hell in here, and we'll have to call him a day.  Oh, my God.  What's up?  What's up?  Hey, how are we going through here?  How stoned are you guys?  Very.  We've been smoking since mass.  Wow.  We've been smoking for, like, how long?  A long time.  What town are you in?  Four hours.  What?  Have you passed Hartford yet? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  We're in New Jersey.  Oh.  We're in the turnpike.  Oh, okay.  Are you going to be home soon?  No, like an hour.  Oh, that stinks.  Oh, same.  Don't hang up.  That's so.  We've been on hold, and we've been talking to you guys for, like, an hour.  Oh.  Please.  Come on.  I like the way she sounds and all.  She sounds really effed up, but...  Oh, God.  Dude, please.  A telephone.  How fast are you going right now on the...  I don't think my friend's got 42 double Ds, if that helps. 
[00:45:00]  That means she's got a big back.  Yeah.  She's a fatty.  She's not fat.  She's got big boobs.  Yeah.  How fast are you going on the New Jersey turnpike?  Well, wait.  How fast are we going?  I'm going 35.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You can't say the S word.  I'm sorry.  I lost the leg.  You're going 35 miles an hour, which means...  Yeah, it's packed.  You're probably pretty stoned.  Yeah.  It's packed, people. 
[00:45:30]  Sure it is.  Unfortunately, we're going to have to say goodbye to you guys.  Oh.  All right?  No, not a rape group.  I'm sorry.  But, oh...  Quinn basketball, what's going on?  Hey, Quinn.  Yo.  Didn't you play with us one other time?  I came in, called in about Wesley Willis.  Okay.  Are you home?  I am home.  And you got some weed? 
[00:46:00]  I got what?  Weed?  You got some weed?  Oh, of course.  And what's the name of your bong?  Skipper.  Skipper?  Yes.  You're smoking that at a skipper?  It drives my boat.  You want to...  Give us a blast.  What is that?  That was my blast, dude.  You didn't just do a hit?  Yeah, I did.  That didn't sound very good.  I'm sorry, man.  It's a little weak.  It's been a lot of use. 
[00:46:30]  You know, the water's old.  I think he's faking it.  Yep.  Let me...  Take a very slow hit off of that thing.  All right.  You didn't hold it in long.  How was that?  Awful.  Awful.  Come on, Jimmy.  We got plenty of people that weed through.  All right, Quinn. 
[00:47:00]  Jimmy, you got to help me out.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  We're going to have to have Stinky screen these people.  Oh, man.  We've never had to screen calls for this.  We have 20 people that want to play.  Hey, we got to find some good stoners to play Stoner Spelling Bee.  All right?  Goddamn.  We got a lot of words.  And basically, these people will be smoking the whole time as we do a spelling bee.  And trying to spell words.  And do we have some good prizes today?  Yes.  Yes, we do.  Ooh.  All right.  So why don't we take another break? 
[00:47:30]  We got to catch up anyway.  We went really long to start the show.  And we'll let Garrett?  Yeah, we'll let Garrett go through the phones and hopefully get some really good contestants  for the Stoner Spelling Bee.  All right?  I hope so.  And hopefully we'll start it by 420, everyone.  Oh.  Oh.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the Opin' Anthony F.U. line.  I'd like to send out a big F.U. to all the pieces of crap that come down the F.E.R. drive  close to Brooklyn Bridge and wait until they get just about to the end and then try to snake 
[00:48:00]  him with the rest of us that have waited on lines like the idiots we are.  You.  You.  I hope the cops are waiting for you at the end and they lock your freaking ass up and take  your car away.  Have a great day.  Next message.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to just give a big F.U.  My brother-in-law kicks me up every morning for work and can't wait 20 f***ing seconds.  F*** you.  You impatient mother f***er.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to send a big gigantic f*** you to Opin' Anthony. 
[00:48:30]  Your f***ing ass legs got that stupid-ass song stuck in my f***ing head and singing it  all day.  You guys f***ing suck.  F*** you.  Next message.  Isn't the big F.U. for that bitch saying that all fat women should go in their moomoo's  into their house and hide?  F.U. you bitch.  We are beautiful, smart, and sexy women.  And she's just jealous because we're taking all the men out there because they know where  the lovin's at with the fat women. 
[00:49:00]  So ladies, go F*** yourself, you ugly whore.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  End of messages.  Get your balls out.  Flap your ass up.  Get your penis.  It's today.  That could be the gayest thing I've ever heard.  And we're back with the Opin' Anthony show.  Lots of people smoking today, Anthony.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:49:30]  We're trying to get some contestants for Stoner Spelling Bee.  We love this bit.  We haven't played in a really long time, but we were supposed to play with Jim Brewer.  But Brewer had to blow us off today.  It's cool.  So we figured we'd go with it anyway, right?  Why not?  I think we've narrowed it down to some contestants here.  Let's see.  We got Dan from, I think, New York.  Hey, Dan.  What's up, bro?  Where you calling from, bro?  Where am I calling from?  Long Island.  Long Island.  Long Island representing.  Damn straight. 
[00:50:00]  And you got a glass bomb?  Damn straight.  Obi-Ban Kenobi.  Obi-Ban Kenobi.  The Jedi Master.  That's his bomb.  Yep.  And how much pot have you smoked today?  Today?  Yeah.  About a quarter.  A quarter so far?  Yeah.  You seem like you're in control.  I'm always in control, bro.  Huh?  Always in control, man.  He's that mellow guy.  Damn straight.  He relaxes, but you know.  The lady killer.  He's got all the answers.  Never out of control when he's smoking the weed.  Damn straight.  Roll back in the Hamptons.  Your personality doesn't change much? 
[00:50:30]  Nah.  Nah.  Hmm.  Just the eyeballs.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Lots of redness.  All right.  Hold on to the line, okay?  We have to decide if we're going with Dan from Long Island.  All right.  He's a little smooth.  He's a little too smooth, I'm thinking.  Right?  Some of the guys will like that, though, you know?  We can get a variety of stoners.  Yeah.  Hey, Rob.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, Ant?  Hey.  Good.  Rob from Amityville.  What are you doing?  I'm doing some bong.  I have to have to work.  All right.  And what's the name of your bong?  I don't really have a name for it. 
[00:51:00]  No?  No.  No name.  Old Faithful.  All right.  Old Faithful.  And how much pot have you smoked?  I did about eight bong hits, right?  Eight bong hits?  Yep.  You're going to have to do a lot more for this game.  Yeah, I'm doing them.  Pretty much you're going to have to be smoking pot every five minutes for the next hour and  a half.  That's what I do when I get home, so.  Another guy that's a little too smooth.  Yeah, he's pretty smooth.  Yeah, I don't think we're going to get the out of control guys.  All right.  These are the seasoned pot smokers.  All right.  Hold on, Rob.  Hold on.  All right. 
[00:51:30]  Let's go to Larry.  Larry's in his garage.  He's a Vietnam vet.  Larry.  Hey, where are you guys been, man?  Where are you calling from?  You ever hear of Dingman's Ferry, Pennsylvania?  P.A.  Check it in.  Yeah, I live up in the mountains.  Live in the mountains?  Yeah, in the woods.  In the woods?  Yeah, I live in the woods.  I only got one neighbor.  Well, how about that?  And you're in your garage right now?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was making a woodcraft.  I was making a bench, but since I started smoking, my wife tells me before she goes to 
[00:52:00]  work not to run my saws.  Yeah, I don't want to.  My buddy was down here, and we cut one of his fingers off on my bandsaw.  Wow.  All wrecked, you know what I mean.  I hear you.  I felt sorry for the guy, man.  Now I call him Four Finger.  How much pot have you smoked today so far, Larry?  Well, I smoke out of a pipe there, Ope.  Yeah.  Is this Ope or in?  Ah, both.  All right.  I like my pipe, man.  Yeah?  I keep it clean, then I boil it up, and I make my own hash out of the residue. 
[00:52:30]  Out of the residue?  You boil your own pipe?  Yeah, once you smoke...  See, I'm not like these other guys.  They smoke that cheap stuff.  Right.  I've got buds here that's orange-y red.  Uh-huh.  Like in the 60s.  Oh, back in the day.  That's what I like.  That way there, you stay with it.  Larry, how old a guy are you?  Fifty-four.  Fifty-four, and you were in Vietnam?  Yeah, 66 to 68. 
[00:53:00]  Right, and boy, they must have some good weed there, huh?  Well, I tell you what, buddy.  Woo!  You ever do any opium, smoke any of that?  I've never smoked the opium.  Me and Norton smoke a bowl of that.  Sir, I would be more than honored to as a veteran, but I quit smoking pot February 1st of 1987,  but I would, however, be happy just watching.  God bless you.  Hey, Norton don't drink or nothing, does he?  He's clean as a whistle.  Well, I tell you what, if he come in this garage, he wouldn't leave straight, because there isn't a person that does. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, was there any truth to the fact that over in Vietnam, though, they said that a lot of the time the Vietnamese were putting stuff in the grass to make people pacifists?  The truth?  Yeah, and that's what I heard.  I would say that's the truth.  No, because my friend Artie Murphy was telling me.  Who?  My buddy Artie Murphy.  I didn't know if it was true or not.  They put it in a weed.  Yeah, man.  Okay.  All right, you know, Larry's perfect for this game.  Larry, you know what I mean?  Larry's going to be representing PA, all right? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, yeah, I just took another zoo off, so I'm ready.  Oh, great.  Great.  He's high and he can't get a run.  Yeah, no, I'm not addictive, Jim Norton.  I get them from my psychiatrist at the VA Wilkes-Barre Straton Hospital.  Right on.  Word, Larry.  You hear me, Jim?  I'm ready for you.  You're prescribed for me.  Hey, Larry, you're in the game, so you've got to start smoking right now.  I am, buddy.  All right.  I'm back to another bud.  All right, pop it in.  And guess what?  I'm going to drink my can Budweiser, too.  Budweiser, Zoloft, and marijuana.  Because I've been drinking Budweiser since 66 over there. 
[00:54:30]  It used to be warm.  Do you know that old?  I hear you, Larry.  I never drink cold or warm Budweiser out of a can, and you're high and wrecked, and you've  got all these slanty-eyed bats coming at you.  Oh, my God.  This is why people like me are half nuts.  Right.  How many weapons do you have in your garage, Larry?  Three.  Yeah, what are they?  What do you got?  We're on the air, aren't we?  Well, no one knows who you are.  We are.  Yeah, that's right.  Who the hell knows me, right?  Yeah.  I got a sawed-off pump.  Mm-hmm.  Wow. 
[00:55:00]  12-gauge.  That's nasty.  That's good stuff.  Hey, you know what?  I cut the barrel off of myself and my garage and the handle, too.  Yeah?  Yeah, when you shoot it, you've got to put a piece of foam rubber either wrapping around  your leg or on your shoulder if you're not strong enough.  That thing will kick right back on you.  Oh, yeah.  It'll blow a hole right through my garage door.  Yeah.  Once in a while, I take it out the back of my house here and round it off.  Hey, can you shoot it once for us?  What are you, nuts?  What up?  Wow. 
[00:55:30]  In the backyard.  I'd have to get a little bit more stoned.  All right.  Well, maybe during the game you can do that if you're feeling good, okay?  Hear me?  You have no neighbors, so just fire one off.  Well, I got one across the road and she says I'm nuts.  All right.  And what other weapons you got, Larry?  I got a .357.  That's a good one to have.  Oh, yeah.  In case somebody comes around, you know what I mean?  That's the one you crawl through the tunnels with and take out them gooks in the tunnels.  Son of a bitches.  That's right.  I shouldn't wear on a radio.  No, that's fine when you're talking about the girls.  You know what?  I go shopping up here to Mr. Z's, right? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  I got my freaking grocery cart halfway full.  I got somebody ahead of me, right?  Yeah.  And I turn around and it's a Vietnamese.  Son of a bitch.  Now, listen to this.  So I said, okay, Larry, you know, no flashbacks.  You're going to remain cool.  Right.  She gets it done.  And she gives the goddamn cashier food stamps.  Oh, my God.  She got more in her cart than I got my cart.  So she's getting, uh, the government is paying for her food.  Meanwhile, you were over there fighting those little slopes.  Yeah.  And you're the one that's paying for your food and you can't afford as much as she can. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, in the cart.  Yeah.  And she had better stuff there, Ope, because I checked.  She bought the good bread.  She didn't buy no, you know what I mean?  We should have dropped the nuke on them sons of bitches.  Whoa.  Yeah.  We should have done more.  Now, I got to take a hit here.  We should have done what we should have done and gone into Cambodia and weeded all them out.  Bastards.  Hey, Larry, you're perfect for this game.  Keep smoking, all right?  I am.  I just did one.  I hear you.  What's the third weapon you got?  What's the third one?  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  It's kind of used.  I got it home with me.  It's an AK-47.  Ah.  Nice.  You bring that one back?  It's very nasty.  Can you fire that off in the backyard for us today?  I might do Betsy for you.  You might do Betsy?  Yeah.  You know which one Betsy is.  The shotgun.  Yeah.  When my buddies come in here, they look at that, man.  All right, Larry, you're perfect.  What is it?  A 12-gauge, Larry?  Yeah, 12-gauge.  It's the only way to go.  You're a pussy if you saw off of anything else.  Hey, Larry, you're perfect.  You know what 12-gauge is. 
[00:57:30]  Larry, we're going to talk to you in a little bit.  See this?  When I smoke, I start talking, man.  It's all good.  It's all good.  You can talk to me as long as you want.  I don't want to talk to Patty in there.  All right.  Hold on, Larry.  Hey, Jim, I love you, man.  I love you, too, Lawrence.  You're a good guy.  Stay on the line.  You are definitely playing strong.  I'm on.  All right, there you go.  Larry is a white guy.  I really like Larry.  Is Larry great?  He's great.  We will have him firing off that shotgun before this game is over.  Without a doubt.  Mike from Cleveland, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, Mike.  How you doing, Mike?  All right, all right.  All right, what's your deal? 
[00:58:00]  Just hanging out after work.  You sound really stoned.  Yeah, I'm tired, too.  You worked hard?  Yeah.  And you got a bong?  Yep.  You got a name?  The Zong.  The Zong?  Mm-hmm.  My bong's The Zong.  Rock and roll.  And you got some good weed?  Yeah.  How much it cost you?  Oh, too much.  Like a little bit? 
[00:58:30]  No, no.  No, like a lot.  I hate when you, like at the tail end of my weed experiences, it was getting to the point  where you get this little bit of weed and it cost more than a lot of bit of weed did.  I like the big $20.  You get four fingers worth of pot and a baggie.  $20, a four-finger lid.  Then you got your dime bags, which you get a lot more than 10 doobs out of.  The $10.  It's a great nickel bag if all you got was a fiver. 
[00:59:00]  Not no more.  Not no more.  Are we going with Mike or what?  You like Mike?  All right, Mike, you're in.  Sweet.  Now they say the weed is exotic, so you're getting what you used to get for $5, like a  nickel bag, but it costs you $80.  Yeah.  Dude, you just need to look at it and you'll get stoned.  Believe me.  Just look at it.  Don't even smoke this stuff ever.  I know, because I've sniffed into that baggie sometimes that Garrett has.  Does he get good stuff, Garrett?  Only. 
[00:59:30]  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Skeeter from Jersey, what's up?  Skeeter!  Yo, what's up, man?  Sorry.  What were you doing?  Smoking.  That guy was drowning me out, man.  I couldn't take him anymore.  Which one?  That dude from Wilkes-Barre.  I wore a Dickman's Ferry jersey.  He was a good guy.  Fancy.  Yeah, he's cool, but I got more smoking done than he did talking.  He's got to catch up.  So you've been smoking.  God's belief.  All right.  Happy 420, by the way.  Yeah, baby.  Right on the nose. 
[01:00:00]  There you go.  Right on the body, baby.  Right on.  You want to go with Skeeter?  Skeeter seems pretty cool.  All right, Skeeter, you're in.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right, hold on in line, all right?  All righty.  So we got Larry in his garage, the Vietnam vet.  We got Skeeter from Jersey.  And who else did we take?  Mike from Cleveland, whose barn is named Vazong.  Vazong.  We'll try to get like two more here, and we're in.  Ben, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, Ben.  Yeah.  What's going on, man?  I'm just chilling, buddy.  How's it going?  All right.  You're smoking some weed? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, I'm smoking out of Mr. Bubbles right now.  Mr. Bubbles is your bond?  Mr. Bubbles.  Can we hear some?  Sure enough.  Hold on.  All right, man.  Hold on.  Oh, that's good.  Dude, that sounds like the best goddamn hit.  I'll tell you what, I just got lightheaded.  You know, it's great when the bong makes the sound like it's creamy, like the smoke is so 
[01:01:00]  thick that it almost muffles the sound of the bubbles.  Yeah.  When it fills up the pipe and it's all white, you're just like, all right, yeah, I know  I'm getting ripped off of this one right here.  That is the best part of it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Then we start coughing the lung up, and you're just like, oh, my God, I'm dying off of this  one.  Ben, we like you.  I like you, too.  Mr. Bubbles sounds pretty good.  Yeah, we're going to go with you.  You're going to be representing Philly, all right? 
[01:01:30]  That's what's up.  Philly in the house.  There you go, Ben and Mr. Bubbles.  Hey, Paul, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Paul from Buffalo.  What's the deal, man?  Not much.  Just sitting here chilling on my day off with my bong Irish.  I call her Irish because she's green and she's white, and then when you burn the weed,  it's orange.  It's all the colors of the flag.  Wow.  You thought about that a little bit.  Yeah.  It took me about a week to come up with that.  Dude, look, my bong is Irish. 
[01:02:00]  Well, I'm Irish, too, so I just kind of liked it.  That's cool.  So does your bong have a really small stem?  Yeah, thanks a lot there, Jim.  All right.  Dick.  Why don't we go with Paul from Buffalo?  Paul seems pretty cool.  He's Irish.  Buffalo giving us the nice little ratings trend today.  We got him representing today.  And Joe from Boston, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you, man?  Pretty good.  Are you in your car?  No, I'm sitting in my living room right now.  I'm on the radio.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who are you with? 
[01:02:30]  I'm showing with my cousin.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He's got the radio on, too.  No, I don't.  You're in the background.  You're in the background.  You know what?  I'm going to cut my losses.  This is crap.  I'm not.  Oh, Jay, that's right.  Good move.  I wasn't feeling it.  Good move.  Let's go to Joe from Boston.  Joe.  All right.  What's up, Joe?  What?  Yeah.  About time I made it on the radio.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Framingham, Massachusetts.  Yes, we know that.  Framingham.  Yeah, represent me.  And you're going to be smoking some blunts? 
[01:03:00]  I just smoked one while I was on hold.  So I'll buy a word with another.  You got a lot of pot?  Yeah, I got plenty of kind, bud, brother.  It sounds like you're on a cell phone.  Hell no.  No?  No.  Hmm.  Hmm.  What do you think?  I guess he sounds all right.  Nope.  You probably will stick up for me.  You sound fine to me, sir.  Thank you.  Hmm.  No, no, no.  Well, what's wrong with the way he's doing?  I kind of like the bongs a little better.  Yeah.  I think that we've got to keep it to all bongs. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Well, then again, Larry's got a pipe.  But Larry's got a shotgun, too.  Yeah, but none of them are smoking blunts.  None of them are smoking blunts.  Then again, a blunt representation may be appropriate to cover all aspects.  You may need one so people can't cry that it would have been different had there been a blunt involved.  At least when you were loyal.  I'm saying that it may be good to have one of those.  Joe, what's your nationality?  I'm half black, half Irish.  You've got to go.  Wow.  You are so in.  You've got to go.  You are torn, man.  Half black, half Irish living in the Massachusetts area.  You're in. 
[01:04:00]  You're goddamn right.  I hope you're black below the waist.  Stuck between a plantation and a buckle.  So, Joe, who raped who?  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, wow.  Who do you think?  My mom got taken by a drive-talking player.  Oh, really?  Your dad was black?  Oh, black is night, man.  And your mom, Irish.  He was so black, he was freaking blue.  And the kicker is I had to grow up with my mom, so I was getting bounced in and out of every other private school around here, too. 
[01:04:30]  So I'm basically like white and black.  I don't know which one to do.  So what was it?  If you're fighting, I'm throwing on the pinstripes.  I'm becoming a ref.  Dude, did your mom take a lot of flack for having a kid with a black eye?  You know, you should see Thanksgiving every year.  I am the black.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You've got to watch our language.  All right.  Do they love you in Southie?  Yeah, right.  I was walking in with a buzz and go, I'm Irish, dude.  That's about as far as I go before I turn around and go back downtown. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  We like Joe.  Yeah.  All right, Joe, you're in.  Hold on a line.  All right.  He'll be representing Massachusetts.  Yeah.  With his blunts, Anthony.  All right, we've got all our contestants.  All right.  We're starting to spelling bee.  There they are.  This is what's up for grabs, Anthony.  Winner's going to receive a pair of tickets to see corn.  Wow, nice.  In Cleveland, Anthony.  They're going to Cleveland?  At Cleveland State University.  Winner receives tickets, hotel, and airfare for you and a friend, man. 
[01:05:30]  Nice.  This is a huge deal.  Not for Mike.  Huh?  Not for the one guy who's been in Cleveland.  And it wouldn't be for Mike.  Well, Mike, you'll still be happy if you win the corn, right?  Hell yeah.  Exactly.  We'll throw in something else because you don't get the hotel or the tickets.  Or the, yeah.  Or the hotel.  I would do that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You should keep the hotel.  Keep the hotel.  Who's looking?  Yeah, screw you.  It'll be fine if you win.  Hold on.  John chips for everybody.  Yeah.  The chances will kick your tongue out.  This is cool. 
[01:06:00]  We want to thank Extreme Radio for giving us this prize in Cleveland.  Nice.  Corn at Cleveland State University.  On Sunday, right?  On Sunday.  Winner receives hotel, tickets, and airfare, of course.  We're going to start Stoner Spelling Bee next.  Stay there.  It's time to play Stoner Spelling Bee on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Corn here to stay.  We've got a trip to see corn in Cleveland at Cleveland State University on Sunday.  Winner's going to receive hotel, airfare, and a couple tickets to see corn this Sunday.  The winner of Stoner Spelling Bee, matter of fact, Anthony. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  A lot of ladies calling in, very pissed off that no female is representing in the Stoner Spelling Bee.  Jillian is on the line.  Jillian.  Hey, dude.  What's up?  What's up?  How come no chicks are playing?  Well, not many ladies called us for Stoner Spelling Bee today for some reason.  Yeah, usually we get more girls.  Where are you calling from?  Long Island.  You're smoking a lot of weed?  Yeah.  North Shore or South Shore?  North Shore.  All right. 
[01:07:00]  Should we get Jillian?  I think you should.  I really want to win these tickets, dude.  Yeah.  She laughs.  She sounds kind of cool.  She's got the pot laugh and she says dude a lot.  Yeah.  I'm smoking really good pot.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  It's going to be between you and Barbara on line three.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Hold on.  That's Jillian.  Let's go to Barbara.  Barbara!  Barbara!  Barbara?  Barbara?  Hello? 
[01:07:30]  You'll be a little too over the top.  Yeah, I don't know if she's faking or not.  Barbara, what are you doing?  I don't know.  All right.  What am I doing?  You sound like the girl at the very first scene of Lethal Weapon.  Oh, wow.  That's good.  Right out the window.  On the rail?  After all the coke and stuff?  What have you been doing?  Heroin?  No.  No. 
[01:08:00]  We've got to play this out.  It can go either way.  Barbara, where do you live?  I'm nothing.  All right.  What are you smoking out of?  Huh?  What are you smoking out of?  Zoe?  Zoe?  Zoe?  Is it a bong?  Yes.  All right.  Let's hear your bong.  I don't want to. 
[01:08:30]  You can make me.  What?  You can make me.  I'm hanging up.  What?  Are you hanging up?  Barbara?  Barbara?  I can still hear something in the background that she dropped the phone.  I don't know.  Hey, Barbara.  That's my head.  I'm so wasted.  Barbara.  Wow. 
[01:09:00]  She's either really stoned or really stupid.  Both.  Barbara.  All right.  I guess Jillian's in.  Yeah.  Ah, Jillian.  Hey, dude.  All right, Jillian.  You're in.  Okay.  All right?  Yeah.  And you'll be representing Long Island.  Nice.  Okay.  All right.  You know what?  I guess we'll just start with Jillian with Stoner Spelling Bee, Anthony.  Might as well.  Okay.  Did he do a hit?  I'm taking one right now.  I've got to hold it in now.  I can't waste this stuff.  It's very expensive.  All right. 
[01:09:30]  All right, dude.  And you want to give the rules of the game.  Stoner Spelling Bee.  Yeah.  Are we going with the three wrong answers?  Um, it could take forever.  It could.  It could be very good.  You want to go two?  You know what?  I think we should just, uh, two strikes are out.  Two strikes, and you're out.  So you misspelled two words, and you are gone.  Okay.  Those are the rules.  Jillian.  All right?  Yeah, sorry.  I was taking another hit.  All right, Jillian. 
[01:10:00]  You're going to start the competition.  Let's do it.  All right, Jillian.  Your word is aardvark.  Aardvark?  Aardvark.  Are you allowed to use that in a sentence?  Yes.  Jillian has to spell aardvark.  Okay.  All right.  I'm going to get this wrong, too.  All right, go ahead. 
[01:10:30]  Spell aardvark.  Aardvark.  A-R-D-V-A-R-D-A-R-K.  I don't know.  Aardvark.  Would you like to try it again?  One more try.  Okay.  Um, A-R-D-W...  A-R-D-V-A-R-K.  Aardvark.  What's wrong?  Try again, dumbass.  Oh.  W?  So close.  Aardvark is A-A-R-D-V-A-R-K. 
[01:11:00]  Dude.  Double A at the beginning threw you, didn't it?  Yeah, well, I'm really...  All right, Jillian, you got one wrong, okay?  All right.  Hold on.  You're still in the game.  All right.  Let's go on to Skeeter from Jersey.  Skeeter!  What is up, man?  How you feeling, bro?  Good, really good.  All right, Jillian already has one wrong.  Okay, good.  By the way, to all you idiots, do not cheat on this game.  No, keep it real.  We can tell.  Keep it real. 
[01:11:30]  All you got is got to keep it real.  That's right.  I mean, if you're playing to cheat, we'll just give you a stupid prize, okay?  Lock yourself in a room somewhere.  All right, Skeeter.  Yeah.  Anthony's got a word for you.  Nice.  Your word is calcium.  Calcium.  C-A-L-C-I-U-M.  Calcium.  Nice.  There you go.  And he even said it twice, like in spelling bee-  I know.  Very good.  Yeah, because I always get kicked out in the first round of grammar school anyway, and I like to watch, so. 
[01:12:00]  All right, why don't you take another hit there, okay?  I just did.  I got down.  All right.  We got to go to my favorite.  Well, all our favorites.  Larry!  Oh, yeah, here.  What's up, Larry?  Hey, that Skeeter guy.  Yeah.  I heard what he said about me.  What?  And I'll meet him one-on-one, and him and I will partake one-on-one, and I'll be standing, and he'll be there in nowhere land.  What did he say to you, Larry?  He said about how he got tired of hearing me go on and on and on.  Oh. 
[01:12:30]  And he's smoking out of a bong.  Why don't you say that?  Well, I got more smoke in my head since 66 than that boy will ever have.  All right, hold on.  You don't want to come over to my house and visit me.  Hold on.  Why don't you tell Skeeter yourself?  Yeah, hold on.  Uh, Skeeter.  Yo.  Larry has a problem with you.  Well, what did you get on my hump for, man?  I didn't think.  You said, hey, you said to Opie and Anthony that you got tired of listening to me on the phone.  Well, let me tell you something.  I got more weed in me than you'll ever have.  I'm 54. 
[01:13:00]  What are you, 21, 22?  And the reason I talk so loud, Skeeter, is because I'm part hard hearing, and I won't  wear hearing aids so I don't look like a dummy.  You remind me of like dice.  You can't get a word in.  What'd you say?  What?  What'd you say, Skeeter?  You say what?  Oh, you want to make fun of me?  No, I...  What?  Don't make fun of me, man.  I haven't.  Larry, show him what you got in your garage, man.  Fire that shotgun off.  Oh, man.  Yeah, why don't we fire in the shotgun, Larry?  Let him spell something first.  Well, calcium. 
[01:13:30]  All right, hold on.  B-A-L-C-I-U-M.  All right, hold on, Larry.  All right, I mean, you got it easy.  And begin.  All right, all right, Skeeter, I'm going to put you back on hold.  There's fights brewing already here.  This is nice.  Okay, Larry, it's time for a word, okay?  How the hell's he live, Boston?  I'll get in my goddamn Bronco.  All right, well, I'll get in the...  Yeah.  Got a gun rack in that Bronco?  I keep them underneath the seat.  You think I'm kidding you?  No, I don't know.  When I buy weed, you know where I put my weed? 
[01:14:00]  Where?  I unscrew it.  I've got the poor Bronco.  You ever see them big air filters?  Yeah.  You take off the cap and the side.  Yeah.  And then you put it in there real nice, and you've got to wrap it tight.  Right.  Now, Skeeter, tell me.  Skeeter's on hold, Larry.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Thank God, calcium.  Well, calcium.  Probably like one of them faggots that was protesting during the war.  I tell you what, if he ever went in the bush with me over there, he'd be an MIA.  The first day.  You frag his ass. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, where's Skeeter?  I'm so psyched for getting new freaks for this show.  I haven't seen Skeeter lately, Larry.  Hey, Larry, you see now.  You know what I mean?  Skeeter's gone.  Oh, you won't see Skeeter no more.  Oh, no.  We all know.  You won't see him no more.  You don't think that don't happen?  How would you?  How would you?  Larry, how would you take him out?  I'd rather go in the bush with Jim Norton than Skeeter.  Larry, how would you take Skeeter out in the bush if you wanted to just make him disappear  in the bush?  How would you take him out?  Well, first of all, I'd make him run point. 
[01:15:00]  You know what the point is?  Right.  He's the lead man.  Yeah.  Well, I'd get him out there real far, and I'd be the second man.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I'd come up on him, and I'd shoot him, but he'd see my face, and I'd see his.  And then what would you say?  Hey, Sniper?  Huh?  Sniper?  There wouldn't be nothing left of that Skeeter.  Tell him you don't want him catching Z's on no effing fire line.  Yeah.  Don't you ever catch...  Yeah.  How about it, Norton on a fire line?  And that kid wasn't catching Z's.  No, it's scary.  No, he wasn't.  That was Junior.  Skeeter didn't really do anything. 
[01:15:30]  I know.  All right, man.  Skeeter did that...  Larry.  Larry, your word is Arizona.  Arizona.  Arizona.  Yeah.  That's the capital A.  R-I-Z-O-N-A.  That is.  He even said capital A.  Look at that.  All right, Larry, go smoke some more.  Pay attention, because I'm wound up, and I'm going to have another beer.  All right, we'll get back to you in a little bit.  How's the Zoloft doing?  Huh?  Oh, I'm 100 milligrams. 
[01:16:00]  All right, Larry.  Is that shotgun loaded?  Huh?  Is that shotgun loaded?  No longer takes to load that shotgun.  It's in here opening.  It won't take long, buddy.  Are we going to fire it today?  I don't...  It all depends.  All right.  That Skeeter better not get me wound up.  Get them shells ready.  God, Skeeter, you better not get them wound up.  You hear me, Skeeter?  Well, listen, I've got to put the phone down and go get a shell.  All right.  You won't be using me next anyway.  I just fell.  All right.  All right.  Well, hold on.  Don't go anywhere too far, though.  All right.  There's Larry back on hold.  He's going to get a shell, Anthony. 
[01:16:30]  He's going to get a shell.  Let's go to Paul from Buffalo.  Fire off some artillery.  Hey, Paul, what's up?  What's going on, dude?  All right.  What's up?  Not much, man.  My word, man.  Yeah.  What word we got for Paul?  Have you been smoking?  Are you kidding me, man?  Yeah, he's smoking the bong named Irish.  Irish.  Yeah.  You want to hear me clear it?  Yeah, yeah.  Clear it out.  Good for ratings. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, nice.  That's nice.  All right.  Paul, your word is Beijing.  Beijing?  Yeah.  Capital B, E-I-J-I-N-G.  Bravo.  Wow.  Paul moves on.  Right on.  All right.  Take another hit there, buddy.  Let's go to Mike in Cleveland.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  What's up? 
[01:17:30]  You're smoking out of the zong.  Hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  How you feeling?  Good, good.  All right.  And you got a word for him?  Your word.  Been in the news a lot.  Afghanistan.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  A-F-G-H-A-N-I-S-T-A-N.  Oh, wow.  These guys aren't stoned enough yet.  Yeah, what the hell?  All right, Mike.

Mr. Bubbles.  Okay.  Your word is apartheid.  A what?  Apartheid.  Or apartheid.  No.  Save that for Joe.  Apartheid.  Apartheid?  Apartheid?  Yeah.  Apartheid.  Apartheid.  What's apartheid?  Remember apartheid in South Africa?  The separation of whites and blacks. 
[01:18:30]  Remember, I, I, I.  It's going to place on the city.  Also known as utopia.  One more time.  Say the word.  One.  Apartheid.  Apartheid.  Okay.  A.  P.  T.  No, hold on.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Apartheid.  A.  P.  A.  R.  T.  I.  E.  D.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Oh, come on, man.

Well, then the next time you should give me, like, Ben.  All right, Ben.  Well, your name is Ben.  Very good.  There goes Ben from Pelley.  Joe representing Framingham.  Yeah, what out?  Half Irish, half black.  Hey, I heard that S, Norton.  Don't think I didn't pick up on that.  Don't be a negative little Nate, all right, buddy?  I apologize.  Joe smoking the blunts, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:19:30]  All right, we got a word for Joe?  Yes.  Okay.  Let's see if he can spell marijuana.  Are you kidding me?  No.  All right, M-A-R-I-J-U-A-N-A.  That's just easy.  Wow.  You got an easy one.  Yeah, well, that happens.  All right.  Hold on, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And keep smoking, everybody.  Okay, we'll go to Jillian.  We'll do one more round.  We'll take a break here.

[01:20:00]  Dude, I can spell marijuana.  What the hell?  What?  You had calcium, no?  No, I had aardvark or something.  Oh, yeah.  Aardvark.  Oh, man.  Are you throwing a D at the end of it?  I don't know.  I've been smoking since I got up waking and baking.  Waking and baking.  A little waking and baking.  All right, Jillian, you get this word wrong.  We're going to have to say goodbye to you already.  Okay.  All right.  Ant, you got one?  I'm not going to really pull one out here. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  Tennessee.  Oh, jeez.  Tennessee.  T.  Oh, boy.  T-E-N-E-S-S-E.  Wait, say that again.  Wait, I didn't even realize what you said there.  Tennessee.  T-E-N-E-S-S-E.  Tennessee, you idiot.  T-E-E-S-E.  One more time.

Anybody, go to Dowling.  Better known as the 13th grade.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, this is great.  I'm getting this on air to millions of people.  Yeah.  Dowling College on Long Island, New York is not a good school.  Jillian, you hang out and drink at the wharf?  No. 
[01:22:00]  It's a good place.  Go down there.  Drink some beer.  All right.  Well, Jillian, we're going to give you a pair of tickets to see Lenny Kravitz as part of  the Tommy Hilfiger at Jones Beach Concord Series on Friday, July 19th.  You guys rock, dude.

All right.  Cool.  Bye.  Bye.  She was cute.  She was awesome.  She was nice and bubbly.  We lost one of our best contestants, I'm going to say.  She was pretty bubbly, and we lost her.  Skeeter.  Yo.  What up, yo? 
[01:22:30]  What's going on?  Do you have anything to say to Larry?  Nope.  Just chill it.  Wait.  Get another word in here.  All right.  This is ridiculous.  This is what's good about stoner spelling bee.  It always starts off slow, but these guys have to keep smoking pot throughout the whole game.  Yeah.  You know, like I said before, this is all I said.  The more you talk, the less you smoke, and it just proves it.  Are you getting down on Larry again?  Oh, no, no.  Love you, Larry.  Love you, Norton.  Love you, Skeeter. 
[01:23:00]  Love you, Larry.  All right.  You got a word for Skeeter there?  Hello?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I guess not.  I thought you were picking this time.  I came up with it at Tennessee.  Yeah, I know.  That was a good one.  How about Thesaurus?  Wow.  For me?  Thesaurus.  Me, right?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Thesaurus.  T-H-E.  S-A-U-R-U-S. 
[01:23:30]  Wow.  This guy.  There it is.  This guy's good.  All right.  Hold on, Skeeter.  I like this.  Yeah.  Skeeter's doing very well.  Skeeter's a bright little boy.  We got Larry in the garage in PA.  Larry.  Yo.  What's up?  Oh, man.  What's wrong now?  Hey, yeah.  That's what Skeeter just said about me.  What did he say?  The more you, what, talk, the less you smoke, whatever.  Yeah.  That's not always the case there, open air.  You know, it's how you smoke and how you react to it.  What are you going to sit there, you know what I mean? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  A fast one or a slow, nice, easy.  I like it slow and easy.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  You get that shell?  Yeah, I got it.  And is it loaded?  I was talking to my buddy, Garrett.  All right.  Is it loaded?  Not loaded yet.  You're going to load it live on the air?  What's my word, man?  I can't spell any of them that you just gave them.  Hey, Larry, I want to hear you load that thing.  Huh?  I want to hear you put a shell in.  Hold on.  I want to hear you put a shell in.  I just took the, I keep it in a nice oil, not an oil rag, but you know what I mean? 
[01:24:30]  Because I just took it apart and gum-blooded it.  You know what that is?  Right.  It blew as the steel.  Yeah, yeah.  And people don't know.  You know how you clean that off?  You get a cold rag and wipe it off.  All right.  There you go.  You ready?  I think a gook's scalp works better.  Yeah.  You ready?  Yeah, let's hear it.  Charlene.  Hear it lock?  I heard it lock.  She's locked.  Here. 
[01:25:00]  Don't wind me up.  Hey, Larry.  Larry.  You know what I mean?  Larry.  Larry.  All I need is a slant-eye to walk in my garage right now.  I just got back in prison.  Larry.  You were in prison, Larry?  Yeah.  For what?  How long?  A few years.  I was down in a Florida state prison.  What did you do?  I got in trouble in Florida.  Doing what?  You know what I mean?  What did you do?  We're on the air, aren't we?  Yeah.  Everybody knows it anyway.  If you were in Florida, it had something to do with drugs. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, drugs and armed robbers.  Armed robbers.  Nice.  What a classic.  I love Larry.  Oh, this is a north.  I shouldn't have done it, Jim.  Yeah, but you know what?  I was young and nuts.  You're still here.  Larry.  I did my time.  Guess what?  Yeah.  I was married.  I got married and divorced.  I have two children.  My daughter's 34.  I know you don't want to hear this, Skeeter.  My son's 32.  I put my daughter through four years of Penn State College.  While I was divorced, I paid all my child support. 
[01:26:00]  On armed robbery money?  No, when I got out of prison.  Stupid phones.  What happened?  Did you lose someone?  Yeah, I lost Skeeter.  I lost Skeeter.  Skeeter calls back.  Oh, boy.  We got his phone number.  Hey, Larry.  This was before I went to prison.  Larry.  I drove a truck for 20 years in Teamsters.  Ah, Teamsters.  There you go.  Hey, Larry, can I ask you something?  Yeah, I got a pension coming in three years.  If I turn 57 and I'm still kicking, I get my Teamster pension.  Is your garage door closed? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  I got an automatic door opener.  I can't be disabled.  Larry.  People see me opening up my garage by hand.  They'll think I'm nuts.  Larry, fire a round off into that garage door.  I can't.  How are you disabled?  What's wrong?  Jesus Christ, you guys are nuts.  Maybe in the back later, but not through my garage door.  I have to buy it.  No, my wife.  No.  All right.  Well, my wife thinks I'm about to start with.  All right.  Give him a word there.  It's Larry in his garage with now a loaded shotgun. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  Sawed off.  He's got a sawed off.  Sawed off.  Let's see.  S-A-W.  No, no.  Oh, S-A-W-O-F-F.  Sawed off.  I spelled it, man.  Move on.  Come get me a beer.  No, Larry.  That's not.  Yeah.  Man, I did get an easy one, guys.  I'll probably get a hard one next.  No, that wasn't.  It's not because I got a sawed off here.  He said sawed off.  I spelled sawed off.  That wasn't your word. 
[01:27:30]  It wasn't my word?  No.  Who's this, Opie?  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Who am I talking to?  Anthony said you didn't get it.  Anthony.  You said, spell sawed off.  You didn't say that, Ed.  And I spelled it.  You spelled it wrong if you were going to spell it.  Larry.  Spell off.  Larry, your word.  This has been in the news a lot.  Taliban.  Oh, the Taliban.  Larry.  Oh, man.  Uh-oh.  Hold on here. 
[01:28:00]  All right.  I just took a hit.  Not a hit, but I put a pot in here.  One more.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on, Ed.  I'll get to you in a minute.  I'm serious.  That skater you want to smoke.  Taliban.  This is awful.  That's as good as tell Jim.

And that was Opie again?  Yeah, go ahead.  Next I'll be looking for him.  I'm off parole, Opie.  I've done my time.  I did my thing.  No, I was just asking.  We asked questions on the show.  No, no.  No, all right.  Next you'll have the FBI here.  No, no, no, no.  I have no problems with you, Larry.  All right.  Taliban.  Taliban.  Mm-hmm.  Capital T.  Mm-hmm.

A-P-A-R-T-H-E-I-D.  See, man, that's a bad one.  You got to give me an easy one now.  All right, how about cunnilingus?  What?  Cunnilingus.  Cunnilingus?  Yeah.  Or cumalingus.  It's called cunnilingus.  Cunnilingus?

What's this?  It's O.B. and Anthony.  Yeah.  How you feeling? 
[01:34:30]  I'm smoking here, man.  I just had to take two nitros, man.  Why?  Well, I got a bottle of nitro in every room of my house here.  Why is that?  I even keep a bottle in my garage.  Were you feeling some pain?  Well, that's why the VA gives me nitroglycerin.  What do you think?  They give it to me to eat that candy?  Yeah.  Why else do they give it to them?  I don't know.  I didn't know.  Well, I have my heart shot.  I take 16 pills a day.  Wow.  My dad died of a heart attack and sugar.  My mother died of a heart attack. 
[01:35:00]  You diabetic?  Yes.  How'd you know that?  You said sugar, so I assume diabetes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Diabetes and heart problems, huh?  Yeah.  Not me.  I ain't got diabetes.  My dad does.  Oh.  See, my heart is so worn out, they can't do nothing with it, so they give me my pills.  It's that goddamn Agent Orange.  Oh, yeah.  Flashbacks.  My nerves.  That's what it was.  All right, listen.  Steve wants to say something to you there, Larry.  Who?  Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Yo.  You're on the line with Larry.  What's happening?  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hold on.  Let me slow everybody down. 
[01:35:30]  You got it.  Sorry, guys.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You had your issues, man.  Why don't you just quit your crying and grow some nuts and fire that gun off?  Larry?  Yeah.  What's wrong?  I don't like him.  Well, you know, quit your crying, bro.  You're still breathing.  Hey, how old are you, man?  How old are you?  That don't matter, man.  That don't matter.  You can be fine, man.  I've had my problems.  I'm happy with life.  I'm still breathing.  That's all there is to it.  You can tell these people you're going to do something while you do it for them.  Hey, I did my...  Get out of my uniform. 
[01:36:00]  Well, hey, man.  That's your issue.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Watch your language.  You don't see me getting beeped.  Yeah, stop the cursing.  You got it, brother.  I'm sorry.  All right, Steve.  So what's your problem?  You're frustrated because Larry keeps teasing that he...  Well, he calls you guys up.  You know, you guys treat him well, and he's offering you something and he ain't pulling it off.  And what's that?  Hey, he's offering to fire his guns off, and he's being a little girl about it.  Hey, I called in to play the effing game. 
[01:36:30]  That's cool and all, but you don't want to play the game.  Don't tell him you're going to do something you're not.  Wow.  All right, you know what?  You know what?  I agree with you.  You know what I am?  I'm a nothing.  I'm a man.  I don't feel like...  You know, you're not going to get me upset.  Oops.  You don't want to.  Believe me.  Let's go, brother.  That's the last damn thing you would ever want to do to me, buddy.  Let's have at it, Holmes.  Yeah, Holmes. 
[01:37:00]  My name's Larry.  No, I'm a man.  You're you, sir.  What is this?  I'm old enough to be your father, boy.  Hey, that's a good thing.  My father died in the water, bro, and I don't hear my mother crying.  Your father what?  My mother don't cry.  Well, then I guess she's not a human being.  Everybody cries.  Everybody has a heart.  Well, you're still breathing, man.  Why don't you quit your crying?  I'm not crying.  I don't want to play the spelling bee.  You want to hear my fall off go off?  Why don't you get your own gun and shoot it off? 
[01:37:30]  I believe that's what he's doing, Larry.  Why?  I think...  Who's firing?  That'd be me doing something I said I'm going to do.  Steve, what are you firing off?  That's my business.  God, you know what?  It sounded like Larry in between, you know, giving him the business was firing.  That's what I thought.  Oh, is that you guys?  Sorry about that.  That's Steve.  Steve's firing...  What are you firing off?  That'd be my 12 gauge.  I'll get anything going you want.  What else you got?  I got a .357 and a .30-0.  Let's hear the .357. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  One minute here.  An old-time single-shotter.  God bless America.  Yeah, thank you.  And what do you got, a .308?  Yeah, hold on.  I'm not done here yet.  All right.  Steve, I'm assuming you live in the woods, right? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  I live as far in the woods as you can imagine.  I hear the dogs barking.  Yeah, they love it.  They love when you fire your gun?  Oh, they love it.  Let me hear that .308.  All right.  Hold on.  One minute here.  Listen to that.  Wow, that sounds good.  All right.  Well, now I've just done it and got me.  My wife's really angry right now.  She could quit being angry because I got guns. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, Larry, what do you think of Steve now?  I'm impressed there.  That's some pretty good weaponry.  All right.  Hey, thank you, sir.  No joke.  I just wanted to get a little ride out of some people.  My wife just walked in my garage door, right?  Yeah.  I turn myself around and respect you for what you did for the country, and I thank you for  that.  Yeah, Steve is giving you props there, Larry.  Thank you.  I love you, man.  All right, brother.  Hey, thanks, Steve.  Oh, and hey, peace, man.  Have a good night.  Thank you, Steve.  Take care.  Larry, he was just getting you riled up, but he gives you his props there.  What's my word, man?  All right.  What's up with the wife? 
[01:39:30]  She listens to you guys all the time, man.  Oh, really?  She pulls in the driveway.  First of all, I didn't open the gates for her to pull in.  You know what I mean, Norton?  Yes, of course.  Yeah, that's what I say.  Exercise.  Yeah, get out and open them yourself.  You're busy.  Christ, Norton.  All right.  So she comes in, and I got Betsy here.  Yeah.  You know what Betsy is.  Betsy's got the sawdoll.  She said, don't even think about it, man.  She went in and slammed the screen door.  She said, you're crazy. 
[01:40:00]  All right.  She's pissed off at you.  All right.  Why don't we continue with Stoner Spelling Bee?  All right.  Who's next?  I think Skeeter's next.  We'll put you on the line with Skeeter, okay?  All right.  Skeeter.  Larry's next.  I'm not next.  No, you're up.  Really?  I think Skeeter...  No, it is you, Angel.  Larry's after you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What happened to that girl that was before me?  She's out.  Nice.  Let's go.  All right.  How are you feeling?  I'm starting to giggle too much here.  This is like funny that I'm even on the stand here and Larry go off on somebody else other  than me.  I thought Larry was giving him the business and just shooting a fire in office. 
[01:40:30]  He already forgot about me.  Yeah.  Two soles off to go.  Hey, Larry.  No.  Hey, Larry.  What's that?  You're on with Skeeter.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't forget about him.  All right.  Oh, hey.  I'm ready to go, man.  You tell him that.  All right.  Skeeter from Jersey.  Go off, boy.  I'll tell you what.  All right.  Skeeter from Jersey.  Skeeter.  Yes.  Your word is liquefied.  L-I-Q-U-I-F-Y.  Liquefied.  The word is liquefied.  I-E-D on the end of that.  Wrong. 
[01:41:00]  Try again, dumbass.  Wait, wait.  You can't.  Oh, I got it.  You spelled liquefied.  You got one wrong.  It's good.  Anyway, you screwed it up anyway.  You're still in the game.  What did I do wrong?  It's L-I-Q-U-E-F-I-E-D.  Oh.  All right.  You got one wrong.  All right.  Larry.  Yeah.  It's to you now, okay?  Yeah.  You know, that's a pretty hard word there, Skeeter.  Yeah, I understand.  All right.  It doesn't sound like you guys are too stoned right now.  I'm smoking right now, here.  It's not that there, Open A, O-N-A, and Norton. 
[01:41:30]  You've got it in the concentration.  Right.  It's not our brain cells.  Well, tell something.  All right.  All right.  It's time for Larry to speak.  All right, Larry.  Your word is illegal.  Oh, nice.  Illegal.  Legal.  That would be, let's see, well, I ought to know that word.  I don't like the way it's...  Oh, wait.  Spell bit.  P-I-G-I-L-E-G-A-L. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, that's it.  Jeez.  All right.  Hold on to the line.  Hey, Larry, you don't have a dictionary or anything, do you?  Yeah, right.  All right.  Hey, don't you accuse him of cheating.  The guy was over there.  Hey, I warned you.  Ope knocking down books.  Why don't you do that?  I'm just asking.  Why would you hate that, Ope?  Everybody thinks I'm a dummy.  I'm no dummy, all right?  All right.  I didn't think you were not.  All right, we hear you.  Take another hit.  We'll be back here.  Right, Norton?  I don't think you're dumb.  Norton, do you think I got a dictionary?  No.  Why?  I didn't get an AK-47. 
[01:42:30]  That's all I need to know, Larry.  Hey, Larry.  Larry, I bet you could spell face toward enemy.  Yeah, I'm going to have another beer, too.  All right.  Hold on, all right.  I wonder what my wife's making for supper.  I'm getting a munchie.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  There goes those guys.  Let's go to Malik.  Malik, what's up?  Yo, what's up, fellas?  You have a problem with Larry, too?  Yo, man.  Yo, if dude's talking about he got a sore off, tell him something to be a chump, pop it off. 
[01:43:00]  You know what I mean?  I got a .357 here.  You got to see how little I am, so I got to hold heat.  Hey, Larry.  Hmm?  Malik is calling you a chump.  Yeah, I heard.  No problem.  I'm a man.  But you're cool, though, Larry.  You know what I'm saying?  I still like the guy.  It's like my man said before.  Nobody's perfect.  I know.  Hey, dude, we get on here and spell words, buddy.  Where are you, Malik?  Can you shoot yours off?  Man, I'm in the hood.  You know what I mean?  A cop just rolled by.  I pop it off.  I'm going right back. 
[01:43:30]  I'm going right back.  Yeah, Malik is a real deal.  We know all about Malik.  You can't do it in the middle of the neighborhood.  I think he's in...  You're in Asbury Park, I believe, right, Malik?  Yeah, when y'all coming back, so I can...  When y'all come out here, I'll probably come out here.  We've arrived the first time.  We're never coming back.  Come on, y'all.  I'm like the mayor of Asbury.  You guys come in.  You guys got a fresh special pass.  I hear you.  With his 357s.  All right, hold on, Malik.  Everyone is getting really pissed off that Larry's got the sawed off and he won't fire.  I know.  We want to hear it. 
[01:44:00]  Maybe it'll be the grand finale.  Who knows?  Paul from Buffalo.  Dude, I hate having to follow that drunken old man.  I hate it.  All right, hold on.  He's a crazy guy.  Hey, Larry?  Larry.  Yeah.  You're a tough act to follow, man.  You're crazy.  You call me an old man.  You know, I'm 54.  Enjoy life.  I know, but I'm 21.  You know what my father told me before he died?  He said, Larry, do me a favor.  I said, what's that, Dad? 
[01:44:30]  He said, live every day to your fullest, bud, because you don't know what tomorrow's going  to bring you.  There you go.  If you don't like me from Buffalo, don't listen to me.  Yep, exactly.  I'm just a man being happy and smiling.  I like you, Larry.  You got gum shitting.  I want to spell work.  I want to spell work.  I'll play Scramblewood if you want.  All right.  Hold on, Larry.  Okay, Paul, it's time to...  I'm just saying he's tough to follow.  I hear you.  Paul, it's time to spell a word.  You missed this.  You're out of the competition, okay?  All right.  I think Ann's got a good word for you here.  All right.  Your word is paraplegic.  Oh, boy. 
[01:45:00]  Paraplegic?  Oh, boy.  It is P-A-R-A-P-A-L-E-G-I-C.  Oh, I'm trying to get you, dumbass.  Oh.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  It's spelled P-A-R-A-P-L-E-G-I-C.  Paraplegic.  Paul from Buffalo.  We're going to have to say goodbye to you.  All right. 
[01:45:30]  We're coming up to see you guys.  I think July 13th is the date, so...  That's my birthday.  Hey, dude.  What?  That is my birthday.  It's your birthday?  Yeah, dude.  All right.  We'll buy a few beers, all right?  Come out and see us, okay?  Sounds good, dude.  We'll have details on our Buffalo trip soon,  but we've got to say goodbye to Paul.  We've got something for him.  Hey, we're going to give you something, Paul.  Hold on the line.  Hey, Paul, July 19th is my birthday.  Maybe we can get together.  You come to the hotel room.  We oil each other up and celebrate.  Hey, Mike from Cleveland.  What's up?  What's up, Mikey?  I don't have any guns. 
[01:46:00]  You don't have any guns?  Ah, pussy.  You're bummed, right?  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be great to just be stoned and fire off guns?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got a word for you.  Mike, your word is Thailand.  Oh, that's easy.  Thailand?  That's so easy.  T-H-A-I-L-A-N-D.  Bravo.  I really didn't think you'd get that.  That whole A-I thing is a little rough.  He moves on.  It's a little rough.  He moves on.  It's okay.  H would have screwed me up. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, Joe from Framingham.  Yeah.  Half Irish, half black.  Half stuck out on the porch like the monkey I am.  Oh, Jesus.  We give you an inappropriate.  I wanted to hear it.  Bob from Boston writes, the black Irish guy from Boston is known as a leprecoon.  Oh, God.  Jeez, man.  I apologize.  That's not nice at all.  Typical person that lives up here.  That's horrible.  Hey, if you get this word wrong, we're going to have to say goodbye to you, Joe.  All right.  Your word is rhinoceros. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, that's easy.  S-A-W-O-F-S.  Watch that language.  Let's let the white half talk on the radio.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  R-H-I-N-O-S-A-U-R-U-S.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  R-H-I-N-O-C-E-R-O-S. 
[01:47:30]  Hey, Joe, we're going to have to say goodbye to you, too, okay?  All right.  We got some good stuff for you, so hold on a line.  That was retarded.  All right.  And thanks for playing Stoner Spelling Bee.  Yeah.  All right.  Bye, Angel.  Wow.  This game has become something a lot different than Stoner Spelling Bee.  Shee Lee. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  You're on the radio, bro.  Oh, yeah, dude.  Listen, I just want to tell you guys that coming from a stoner, this is the biggest cluster F of a show that you've ever done.  I know.  What do I know?  I mean, this is worse than the money snatch, dude.  Come on.  You've got to love the gunfire.  I love you.  Who doesn't love a little gunfire?  I'm an American like everyone else.  There's been gunfire.  There's been laughs.  There's been a little bit of a gun pleasure.  Some drug use.  Some drug use.  There's all sorts of stuff going on. 
[01:48:30]  Patriotism.  All right, Shee Lee.  I just hope you learn that anything involving stoners is just going to go down to it.  That's the bottom line.  But that's why we like doing it.  Norton, you rule.  Thank you, fella.  All right.  There you go.  Shee Lee.  And let's go to Paul real fast.  Hey, Paul, what's up?  Paul, hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, I'm trying to figure out.  Am I listening to a spelling bee or an NRA meeting?  No doubt.  Come on.  Norton, you rule, man.  Thank you, sir.  You wouldn't say that if you knew I had Gold Bond itch cream on my yam bag right now.  Due to a little ranch that was developing. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, really?  Not yet.  Sweating by my taint.  You can't see it.  It was just a little itch.  A little itch?  A little taint itch.  And I've worn Gold Bond medicated itch cream.  I'm sorry, powder.  And applied it to my 33-year-old taint and ball bag.  And it was like putting gas and light in it for 30 seconds.  Because it gets very, it really is like a cool breeze.  Yeah, yeah.  Bag, yeah.  So now my ball bag smells like my grandmother.  Oh.  All right.  It's Stoner Spelling Bee.  Not the first time.  We got the trip to see corn at Cleveland State University on Sunday for the winner and a friend. 
[01:49:30]  We got the hotel.  We got the airfare.  We got the tickets.  So we're down to three guys.  We got Skeeter from Jersey, Larry in his garage, the Vietnam vet there, and Mike from Cleveland representing.  We'll continue next and get a winner.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Three contestants left in the Stoner Spelling Bee, Anthony.  A lot of guys, a lot of girls want to hear Larry shoot off his gun.  We don't know if it's going to happen.  We'll have to wait and see.  I think his old lady's giving him grief about it. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  JJ.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hang in.  All right.  What do you got today?  I got to talk to Larry, man.  He's my bro.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Hey, Larry.  Yeah.  We're eight.  Who's paying for this phone call?  You are, Larry.  Hey, Larry.  I figured that.  Larry, you're my man.  Who's this?  I'm 54.  There you go.  He was overseas with MACG 38.  And those are punks that are giving you ass.  Man, the only gun they ever saw was between their legs. 
[01:50:30]  There you go.  That's the only one they ever shot.  Yeah, well.  They probably had to do it themselves, too, Larry.  Hey, you know what, buddy?  If that goes over my head, I don't worry about it.  Man, if these guys ever saw a real weapon, you know what they'd do?  They'd probably want to join the Tuesday Night Hummer Club and service us.  All right, JJ.  Go for it, Larry.  You're my man.  Hey, I got to spell some words, JJ.  You do it.  Yeah.  All right, guys. 
[01:51:00]  This is for fun.  Go for it.  That's it.  They sound like the same guy, JJ and Larry.  All right, JJ.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Hey, Larry, what branch of the service were you in?  Hey, Norton, are you paying for this phone call?  Yes, yes.  The check's in the mail.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Larry's getting all upset.  There are other people that want to shoot off some guns.  Maybe we'll get to them in a little bit, too.  Jay, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Yeah, what's going on?  I just want to say one thing.  All you people that don't like Larry, they need to show him some respect. 
[01:51:30]  That's right.  And all the vets out there, man.  Crap my pants if I was in there, man.  Of course.  You would crap yourself.  Yes, if you were a knob.  A bunch of goddamn commies, probably the same panty waist that were protesting the war,  right, Larry?  Communists.  Communists.  No, don't spell communists.  U-M-N-C-O-M-U-N-I-S-T.  Move on.  Larry, you're not spelling right now, Larry.  Hold on.  He said communists. 
[01:52:00]  All right, Jay, go.  We've got to get back to that.  All right, guys.  All right.  A lot of people want to know, Larry, who else you don't like in this country?  Who else?  Yeah.  In this country.  Yeah.  I just don't like the, you know what I mean?  We call them people.  The what?  Them people that can come over from that other country over there.  Which one?  Yeah, you're right.  First of all, I don't like the people where a dot in their head. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, you don't like the Indians?  And I don't like the Russian Jews.  The Russian Jews.  Right.  I live in a private development here, you know, in the Poconos?  Yeah.  And the Russian mafia is moving in here, building new homes.  You would not believe it.  You can't fault them for that.  Okay.  You're right.  Who's this?  ORA, whatever, Jim?  That's not.  Please have respect for somebody.  Absolutely there, Larry.  Say, hello, good morning, wave. 
[01:53:00]  How are you doing?  Do not, no disrespect to us.  They're not neighborly.  Fire up your weapon.  Jim, you just hit the nail on the head.  They're not neighborly.  That's pretty much, you know, they're not neighborly.  What branch of the service are you in?  I wanted to ask you.  Army.  Oh, you are?  Okay, cool.  Hey, Larry, a lot of people are saying you're cheating, by the way.  Cheating?  Cheating.  Well, you know what?  Come up in my garage, then.  I don't have a dictionary.  What the hell do I...  Hey.  I'm just...  I'm just...  Don't kill the messenger.  Okay, who's this?  Is this O or A?  Hold on. 
[01:53:30]  If you don't believe me, look.  Brian will say it to you.  Brian?  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  What's up?  This guy's cheating, bro.  Brian thinks you're cheating there, Larry.  I spelled calcium.  Cal, calcium.  Caliban.  It takes like 10 minutes to answer.  Yeah, you're taking a little too long.  He's playing dumb, you know?  He's cheating.  Yeah, you know what?  You're a liar.  He's one effing liar.  Because I take the time to spell words, I think, because I want to win this game.  And you want to...  If I get off my goddamn milk crates and foam over when I sit on my garage and go into my beer refrigerator two steps and have a beer, I'm not looking at no dictionary. 
[01:54:00]  Are you still smoking there, Larry?  Yeah.  All right.  I had about 10, 11 bowls.  All right.  Now, don't...  I'm not cheating.  I'm not like that.  I'm sorry.  I believe you, Larry.  Okay, Joe...  They want to bust my homes fine, but you know what, people?  I'm not cheating.  I am myself.  Joe from New Hampshire.  Live free or die.  What's up?  And if you don't like it, then don't listen to me and cut me off.  If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.  You're there?  Hey, Joe, what's up?  What's up, guys?  All right.  What do you want to do today? 
[01:54:30]  All right.  Let me see.  We'll put a little 30-round mag in this AR-15 and let it rip.  Oh, AR-15.  Let's hear this, man.  All right.  Prepare...  Here we go.  Oh, jeez.  What do you think, boys?  Goddamn, that rock, dude.  Holy jeez.  What the F is going on today?  AR-15.  Nice.  Please do that in a shopping mall. 
[01:55:00]  Larry, what'd you think of that?  Man, I got a rush.  That sounds good, man.  Hey, dude, could you load up another clip?  I got plenty more.  Tell them I had a rush, man.  I want to hear that again.  Larry, he here.  Is it Joe?  Yep.  Where do you live?  I had a nice rush there, man.  You live in the middle of nowhere, right?  Sort of, kind of.  New Hampshire's great.  They don't care, right?  Nah.  They'd rather you're shooting than not up there in New Hampshire.  What are you shooting at, Joe?  I got a steel plate out there.  Yeah?  Steel plate out there.  Smash the one in your head, you nut. 
[01:55:30]  I love that.  All right.  Let it rip again.  All right.  Let me go down to the basement and get another mag.  Get another clip.  All right.  In the meantime, uh...  Lock and load!  Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang.  I love it.  Let me go to Jake, who's pissed off at Larry.  Jake?  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  I'm a Russian Jew, man, and I have something to say to that guy.  What's him at?  Don't mess with the Russian Jews.  Larry?  Yeah.  You got a Russian Jew that's on the phone mad at you.  What?  Yeah, the Russian Jews are nice people, man.  Oh, they are? 
[01:56:00]  Okay, maybe you're a nice person.  But can I say this?  The Russian Jews that moved into this development where I live, they're not neighborly.  They're not friendly.  They don't care about us.  That's because they probably don't speak English, man.  Hold it.  Yes, they do.  And I'm not saying all Russian Jews are bad.  I'm not saying that.  There's good black, bad white, black, good white, good whatever.  Everybody's equal.  You sound like a nice guy.  There you go.  And you're a Russian Jew.  You're right.  Everyone's equal, man.  Okay, but not everybody's the same. 
[01:56:30]  You ready, boys?  Oh, well, wait a minute.  Everybody, hold on what you're talking.  I want to be quiet.  I want to hear Joe again.  Here we go.  Lock and load.  New Hampshire.  Ready?  Yeah.  Ready.  All right.  All right, Joe.  Get out of here.  Goddamn, Joe.  That rules.  You guys suck.  Thanks, man.  Here goes Joe.  Joe wins the gun contest for today, man. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, I don't think anyone's beaten that today.  It's beautiful.  All right, Jake.  We've got to let you go.  Beautiful, man.  Jack's been beautiful, man.  Ted and Sean.  Hey, she's living proof that horses' asses aren't only on horses.  Hey, can we hear more of them gunshots?  Hey, who's this?  Skeeter?  Yeah.  Can we hear more of them gunshots?  Outstanding private pile.  They finally found something to do well.  Hello, Larry.  Now, remember me from 50 X?  The name?  The name, Larry?  All right, Skeeter.  Skeeter, stop trying to be a gook prostitute. 
[01:57:30]  Look at him, Nicky.  Like a Spanish gook.  Look at him, Nicky.  All right, Skeeter, how wasted are you?  I'm doing a Spanish-Mexican there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm pretty wasted.  Obviously.  All right, you're on the phone with Larry, okay?  All right, Larry.  All right.  What's happening, man?  Who's going to win this?  Larry, I know you're cheating because you said just minutes ago that you spelt the word  calcium.  I spelt the word calcium.  All right.  Yeah, you know what?  You said you lived in a private community, and then you said you moved into the community. 
[01:58:00]  Well, you know what?  Is it?  You know what, Skeeter?  I think you're reading something.  You got calcium right in front of your face.  You got everything written there.  Hey, Skeeter.  No.  Let me tell you something.  You're a cheater.  No, I'm not a cheater.  I'm stoned.  I forget what I'm saying.  How could you forget calcium?  That was my question.  Very easy when you get my age.  Very easy, buddy, at 54.  Skeeter's getting braver.  I know.  I'll tell you what.  God bless you when you get my effing age, because I'll tell you what.  I'll kick your goddamn ass.  And I'll come down there and pay a 50 cent total at the digger. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, well, you try it.  I know where you live.  You know what?  Bring it on.  You know, I'm trying to win a spelling contest.  Skeeter.  You're telling me I'm cheating.  I'm not cheating.  And I swear to my mother and father's great.  Listen, if you fire up a gun right now, I'm hanging up and you guys can give the price  to somebody else.  No, no, no, no.  Skeeter, have some respect, Skeeter.  God damn it.  This is ridiculous.  It's an atrocity.  Let me say, America, love it or leave it.  Yep.  Let me just say that.  Listen to this, Larry. 
[01:59:00]  How about you spell M-I-A for me?  And then you can take the cake, friend.  Don't you even start, Skeeter.  I'll kick your ass.  I don't like the way you're talking to Larry.  I don't either.  I don't like the way the Vietnam soldiers were treated.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I giggle.  Love you, Larry.  Love you, Norton.  Love you, Ant.  All right.  Let's get back to the star spelling bee.  Jesus.  What a hell of a game.  All right.  Here's a great word.  Is this for Skeeter?  This is for Skeeter.  Skeeter, you get this wrong.  You're out of here.  All right.  All right.  Your word is camaraderie.  Camaraderie. 
[01:59:30]  C-O-M-M.  R-A-D-E-R-E.  Oh, no.  So sorry.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  It's C-A-M-A-R-A-D-E-R-I-E.  You know what you sound like right now?  It's wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  I don't even know what I'm spelling anymore.  The guy talks too much.  All right, Skeeter. 
[02:00:00]  We're going to have to say goodbye to you.  Hey, listen.  Oh, dude.  I'm the Jim Brewer look-alike guy.  I have off this weekend.  If this guy doesn't want to go, this hillbilly, I'll go to Cleveland, man.  Another contestant, Mike from Cleveland, is still in.  Well, we're going to give you a pair of tickets to see Jim Norton's Yellow Discipline  Tour at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, on Saturday, August 10th.  How about that?  Boy, is that a sucky prize.  Other guys get, like, David Lee Roth and Lenny Kravitz.  Right?  And you get Norton and Red Bank.  Take a song sale Saturday.  Love you, Norton. 
[02:00:30]  Love you, Hope.  All right.  You have no idea what you just won, but hold on.  I do, but can I get something better?  Because, listen, I'm off this weekend.  I can go to Cleveland.  Oh, my God.  No, there is.  You can get something better, but it's not possible to get anything worse.  Come on, Norton.  I want Cleveland.  Help me out.  You lost.  I can't help you in Cleveland.  Sorry.  Can I get something better?  That's classic.  Hold on a line.  Ooh, Skeeter is.  We'll figure it all out in the end here, all right?  All right.  Give you nothing.  All right.  Sergeant Barnes wants to say it.  Sergeant Barnes, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  What's up?  I wanted to tell you about the time. 
[02:01:00]  Man, what's his name?  We're out in Nam?  Yeah.  Yeah, he took this gook set off.  Oh, man.  I ain't never seen brains like that before.  All right.  I saw that effing head come apart, man.  All right.  Very nice.  He was out in the bush, and he shot Elias in the back, man.  Very nice.  Take it easy.  All right.  He's laughing at you, man.  Hey, Larry?  Yeah, you tell Skeeter the hillbilly's still here.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  You know what?  I'm going to be honest with you guys.  I don't know who Crow or Corn is or whatever.  Corn.  And if I win it, you give it to somebody or give it to charity. 
[02:01:30]  All right.  I am dead sure.  I don't know.  And I'm not cheating.  I'd rather go see Norton.  We've got two guys left for the corn trip, and one guy is from Cleveland where we want  to fly someone to, and we have another guy that doesn't even want to go.  Right.  This is real good.  All right, Larry, you ready for your next word?  I haven't flown in anything since 68, and I'm not flying to Cleveland, Jack.  Oh, really?  You can put me in a limo or give me my Bronco.  Well, and me and Norton are two out to Cleveland together, and we'll hit the bookstores.  We should, like me and Henry Lee Lucas? 
[02:02:00]  Henry Lee Lucas.  All right, Larry.  Iron Nose is serial killer.  Okay, what do I got to spell?  I don't want these guys to say I'm taking too much air time.  All right.  Your word is Mediterranean.  Mm-mm.  The sea.  Whatever.  Mediterranean.  Mediterranean.  M-E-D.  Med.  Is there one D or two Ds, Larry?  All right.  M-E.  Do I get? 
[02:02:30]  Oh, I don't get a second chance.  M-E-D-D-E-R.  R-I.  Mediterranean.  What are you laughing at?  You.  Oh.  It's just Oprah Amp.  I want to concentrate.  That was Jim.  It was not me.  It was Jim.  You want me to spell the sea?  Yeah.  Mediterranean.  Right.  He already misspelled it.  Come on. 
[02:03:00]  Larry, you misspelled it.  We got to be fair.  Okay.  What type?  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  You got one wrong, though.  Try again, dumbass.  You got one wrong, so you still got one wrong.  How do you spell that, buddy?  M-E-D-I-T-E-R-R-A-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R 
[02:03:30]  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  No, no.  You said Russian Jew, I'm down the street from his house.  I'm going to kill him.  Larry, I'm going to kill you.  Shut up.  What are you trying to say, huh?  I'd send you to the gulag.  You pay.  All right, listen.  Don't get Larry all paranoid, all right? 
[02:04:00]  It's Russian Frenchy.  All right?  I said you do belong to the gulag.  What an ass.  Eat boards, you stupid ass.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Yo, Larry, lunatics like you to keep loading guns in the garage make me feel safe, man.  Yep, that's right.  I make you feel proud to be an American.  All right, cool.  There's a bunch of other people that want to shoot their guns off today.  Oh, anyone wants to shoot their guns, let us know.  I want to.  I just missed my first word. 
[02:04:30]  I can only miss one more and I lose all that surprises.  Larry, you're going to be able to fire that shotgun?  I don't know.  My wife just came out.  I wonder what the heck we're eating for supper tonight.  But where's the pants in the van?  Who was in country?  Your wife?  Who was out there fighting the cruise?  Swann and I have been together for 15 years.  Who was over there in Da Nang?  And I finally married her and I should have never got married.  I haven't been married a year.  I should have just lived with her and signed that paper.  You're hating a marriage, huh?  No.  Jesus.  Hey, Lieutenant Callahan. 
[02:05:00]  How you doing?  All right.  What can we do for you, sir?  You're on the air, bro.  Yeah, I'm important to get on the air and tell these little guys that they don't know what it's like to be a man.  They don't have a patriotism that we had.  Exactly.  They wouldn't get out there and fight for a lot.  You know what?  God.  These guys.  Stop with the S word.  We're on the air here.  Yeah, stop cursing.  They all talk the same way.  I love it.  I love it.  Used to defending our right to say whatever we want. 
[02:05:30]  That's what they're doing.  Callahan, make it fast.  Let's go.  Sweet.  Yeah, that's pretty much all I had to say.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, Callahan.  He was sticking up for Larry.  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  It's down to Larry and Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Holy mackerel.  What a mess of a game, huh?  Yeah.  Pretty crazy.  How are you feeling with the Zong?  Pretty damn good.  All right.  You have none wrong here. 
[02:06:00]  What's that?  You have none wrong.  Yeah.  You're batting 1,000 there.  All right.  You ready for your word?  Yeah.  Okay.  And you got one for him there?  Yes.  Your word is pharmaceutical.  Oh, nice.  Pharmaceutical.  Ouch.  T-H-A-R-M-A-C-E-U-T-I-C-A-L-S. 
[02:06:30]  Yes.  A-L-S.  Wow.  Good man.  Mike, that's pretty amazing.  Are you cheating?  The EU is good.  It helps me concentrate when I smoke the bong.  Are you cheating?  No way, man.  Doesn't sound like he does.  All right.  All right.  Right there.  Hold on a line there.  Actually, we'll keep them both on here.  Hey, Larry.  Yeah.  It's back to you, bro.  Hey, what's happening?  If you are.  Hey, Jim, what's happening?  Pharmaceutical or something?  Come on.  Hey, I don't accuse nobody or nothing. 
[02:07:00]  Lay it on me, Al.  Wow.  If you are.  I only got one.  I got this.  I'm out.  So, come on.  I'm going to fight it to my death.  All right.  If you misspell this word.  I know.  I'm out.  I'm out.  Okay.  You're not talking to Laverna, sure.  You're talking to Larry.  Yeah, Larry, no.  I'm talking to, uh, what's his name?  That faggot.  Oh.  Skeeter.  Uh, Tippi Tom?  No, not Tippi Tom.  Skeeter.  Wheelchair Fred.  Wheelchair Fred from earlier?  Gay Marco.  Oh, Gay Marco.  Isn't that the guy that calls in and gives all that grief?  I'll smack him in a heartbeat.  Give me a word over there. 
[02:07:30]  Larry.  Larry.  Hey, Slayer.  Larry.  Hey, Jim.  What'd Jim say?  I see you slap him right in the face.  Oh, yeah.  And I'll have you back me up, buddy.  I'd turn my back on Jim Norton a minute and not worry.  And I don't even know the guy.  I've never seen the guy.  Hey, Mike.  He's a man and he's a friend.  I love him.  I kind of look like Ricky Martin.  Hey, Mike.  You still listening?  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  Hey, Mike.  Good luck to you, man.  Larry.  Larry.  You're right.  I mean that, Mike.  Larry's my hero.  Friend's a friend.  Larry, here's your word.  I smoked more than what you did, Mike, today, so I got to spell this. 
[02:08:00]  I got it, man.  You know what I mean?  I got it, man.  Here we go.  You ain't got it on me.  Here we go.  Sociopath.  What?  The word is sociopath.  Sociopath.  Yeah, right.  Sociopath.  Sochia?  Sochiopath.  No.  The word is sociopath.  Right. 
[02:08:30]  Sociopath.  Yeah.  S.  Good start.  How do you spell it?  Sochiopath?  How do you spell it?  How do you spell it?  Yeah.  Huh?  You got to give me time.  I got to think here.  S.  O.  T.  O.  Sociopath.  Uh-huh.  Can I get a hit? 
[02:09:00]  No, I won't do that.  S.  O.  D.  Mm-hmm.  Uh-huh.  S.  O.  D.  That's all you want to give?  S.  O.  T.  Come on, Larry.  Bring it home.  Come on.  What do you got?  You got it.  S.  Yeah.  S.  Social.  Social.  S.  O.  C.  Okay. 
[02:09:30]  Social.  That's got to be an I.  O.  Social.  P.  Uh.  Path.  Hold on.  P.  Path.  P.  A.  Social.  Social.  Path.  P.  A.  A.  A.  A.  I think you're well over the time limit.  Yeah, Larry.  We don't even have a time limit, and he's over it.  You had an S.  O. 
[02:10:00]  D.  You had an S.  O.  T.  What is it?  It's S.  O.  C.  I.  O.  P.  A.  T.  H.  P.  I.  T.  H.  This guy.  Oh, we got another gun.  Hold on one second, Larry.  Hold on, though, Larry.  Where am I going?  All right.  One four national.  All right.  Randy.  Yeah, what's up?  Where are you?  I'm in Columbus, Ohio.  All right.  Turn the radio down.  Oh, sorry.  In the car.  All right.  Find a hot chick in that city if you can.  You're in your car? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, I'm going to shoot my gun off.  In your car?  Yeah.  I don't worry about it.  What are you going to shoot at?  I'm going to shoot it in the air.  Straight up.  Shoot.  You ready?  Here we go.  That was for Norton.  Oh, that is funny. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  I'll give him that.  Lieutenant, what's up?  Yeah, this is Lieutenant Moorhead.  I want to talk to this dumbass Larry.  Yeah, all right.  Lieutenant Moorhead.  Listen, listen.  First off, two things.  You don't know one thing about being a patriot.  And two, you don't know anything about smoking climate.  You understand me?  Don't you even try to talk down to Larry.  He's a war hero, goddammit.  Anthony, stay out of this, please.  I don't want to hear you.  You're nothing.  All right.  We got to say goodbye to Larry, unfortunately.  Larry.  Hey, Larry.  Yeah, okay.  I didn't win it, Norton.  I'm sorry, man. 
[02:11:30]  I know you were rooting for me, Jim, weren't you?  I was right behind you, Lauren.  And you know what?  I screwed up as social, like a social event.  Right.  Social path.  P-A-T-H.  Right.  Lawrence of Arabia, are you royalty?  You did a great job.  Thank you, but hey, I hung in there.  I'm glad I got a chance.  Hey, I got a complaint.  Well.  Two weeks ago, I sent in a self-addressed stamped envelope.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, O&A.  And outside, I got your address for the station there. 
[02:12:00]  My wow sticker.  All right.  You know what?  Hold on a line.  You know what?  Oh, in two weeks.  Come on.  That mail ain't that slow up here.  No, they open our mail before we get it, so sometimes it gets delayed by a week or two.  Yeah, let me, we'll put you on hold.  We'll get your address.  We'll send out a lot of nice stuff for you.  Hey, Jim.  Yes, sir.  Sometime, if I ever get to see you, I'd like to shake your hand.  I've got tears in my eyes for one reason.  You're a hell of a funny guy.  Thank you, Larry.  I love you to death.  Thank you, Larry.  Larry, are you crying?  A little bit. 
[02:12:30]  Why?  Because I'm happy.  Why?  You had fun today?  Yeah.  If you come to any show you want, Larry, we'll get our tickets.  You all right there, Larry?  Yeah.  You sound a little misty.  Yeah, I'm crying.  Why?  My wife's sitting right here because I'm happy.  You're a happy guy.  Yeah.  Now, take out that AK-47 and shoot her and make us happy, Larry.  Jesus Christ.  What about the insurance money?  What do you think, I'm dummy? 
[02:13:00]  Very good, Larry.  Larry, think about that check, you know what I mean?  Larry, we love you.  We're going to have you back on the show, okay?  Yeah, how are you going to do that?  We're going to get your number when we put you on hold.  Oh, yeah, I'd love to be with you guys.  Or you just check in from time to time, okay?  Yeah, you're good people here.  It's hard to get through to you guys.  Well, yeah.  I use that one number all the time when I get that message service, Karen.  I have no idea.  And so I got this other number from, I called in at Black Girl.  Right.  Well, you know how those people. 
[02:13:30]  It's 212-757-1027.  Well, that's one of many, yeah.  Yeah, well, whatever.  All right, Larry.  Hey, it's good talking to you guys.  Hey, Norton, I love you.  You're all stinky.  Thank you, Larry.  Larry, I'm glad we made you happy today, all right?  Hey, thank you a lot, man.  Yeah, you made my day.  All right, cool.  Take care, Larry.  Hold on the line, Larry.  Love you, sir.  Later, buddy.  Listen to Larry.  You all right, Larry?  I want to make sure you're all right before I hang up.  I am fine.  I'm just happy. 
[02:14:00]  One of the best days of my life.  This is one of the best days of your life?  Yeah.  Why?  Because you had a good time, right?  I had a good time.  No pressure, no strain.  You know what I mean?  That's a lot of fun.  People are nice.  Good people hanging out.  Good friends.  Right, Larry?  You hit the nail right in the head, buddy.  That's where we are now.  We're Larry's pals and Larry's our pal.  All right, Larry.  God bless you.  Hey, God bless you.  All right, Larry.  There goes Larry.  Larry, a true American hero.  Wow.  Great guy.  Larry, you're getting a little choked up. 
[02:14:30]  You got a lot of fun today.  Probably doesn't have a lot of fun a lot of times.  You know what I mean?  That's what I'm thinking.  You're hanging out, you listen to a show, and then all of a sudden you're a star of the  show for the day.  Yeah, you're part of it.  You're hanging with people that you enjoy.  Yeah.  Hey, Mike?  What a bunch of nice guys.  We are nice guys.  Mike, you win Stoner Spelling Bay.  Wow.  And you're from Cleveland, so you're not bad.  Oh, yeah.  But you know what, though?  We're going to give you the hotel room.  Week.  And we'll throw in some other stuff because you don't need the airfare.  Awesome.  But you got a pair of tickets to see corn at Cleveland State University on Sunday. 
[02:15:00]  Rock.  So hold on to the line and congratulations, my friend.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  There he goes.  Mike from Cleveland, the winner of Stoner Spelling Bay.  Sorry again, Skeeter, about your awful prize.  Quick break.  When we get back, I think more guys want to shoot and stuff.  Oh, great.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area, 877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, 866-277-4. 
[02:15:30]  Wow.  Jim has a comment, and then we've got to go to one of our Wow contestants.  She's very pissed off at us.  We'll give her some time on the show in a minute here.  Jim, what's up?  Yeah, I wanted to know who Larry's going to replace on the show.  And since he's dilapidated, does he have to be gay to get on?  Yeah, we have too many gay people joining the show for some reason.  But they're not just gay. 
[02:16:00]  They're like he said, dilapidated gay people.  Right, exactly.  Well, here's the deal.  Stalker Patty is out.  Gone.  Lady Di, most likely, out.  Most likely, definitely.  Well, we've got to get Lady Di and Marion on the phone, is what I'm saying, Ant.  But before we say, you know, true, yeah, we've got to break the news to her.  And I think Black Earl, out, by his own accord again.  He'll be back.  No, it's obvious Earl can't handle the pressure that is the Opie and Anthony show.  He can't handle having fun. 
[02:16:30]  He can't take a joke like the rest of us.  Right.  You want to explain really fast, Ant, what happened to Earl today?  Well, everybody, some guy has been putting our faces, pictures of our faces, and with Photoshop or whatever program he uses, putting them on the nude bodies of the Girls in the WoW contest and doing a damn good job of it.  And it's funny as hell when you pop up a picture and there's my face on this hot body.  We all look Norton.  Ridiculous.  One of my favorites is one of Jim Norton.  You're on this hot body, blonde hair, and the girl's finger must have been in her mouth, and they kept that in there. 
[02:17:00]  And you're biting the little girl's finger, and you've got this beautiful body, and it's hysterical.  Well, they did it with Earl.  This guy did it with Earl.  And somebody, Steve C., put it on Earl's computer as his wallpaper.  And Earl lost his mind.  He broke the computer.  He threw a big tub of salad and dressing at the microwave oven and decided now he's not going to talk to anybody.  Well, he just can't be part of the show.  He can't take a joke.  And I think he's also grumpy because they're not giving him that Black Rock Coalition show here on this station. 
[02:17:30]  Those pictures are up on foundrymusic.com, by the way.  Yeah.  Our heads on these hot chick bodies.  And I don't know.  We should put that up on opiananthony.com as well.  It's really, really funny.  You can get to foundrymusic.com through opianthony.com, so it's almost as good.  All right.  Thanks, Jim.  Love you, Ope.  Love you, Garrett.  I love that.  Clayton, really fast.  Clayton.  Clayton.  Hey, guys.  I didn't take it.  It would be so tough. 
[02:18:00]  It's so fun.  You did.  Your phone's breaking up.  I basically want to say he was touched by that 520.  Touched by it.  We got another gunfire guy?  I was very surprised that Larry started crying at the end of that.  I know.  He had a good time.  Isn't that nice?  He had a great time.  Dave, what's up?  Hey.  Shotgun.  What do you got?  It's a 12-gate shotgun.  Well, where do you live?  Upstate New York.  Oh, so you're out in the middle of nowhere?  Yeah.  All right.  You want to, what is it, a pump or a single?  Single.  Single shot?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, let's hear it. 
[02:18:30]  That's good.  That's a good one.  Pop the shell.  That's it.  All right.  Put another one in.  Come on, one more.  Let me hear it.  Okay.  Shooting right off the porch.  All right.  I love gunfire.  Thank you, Dave. 
[02:19:00]  You're welcome.  Some guys checking in from Massachusetts saying, I haven't heard this much gunfire since I was  last in Lowell.  No ass.  Good local reference.  Guys, we want to send you to Lowell for a bar gig.  Yeah.  Can we go there in a tank?  Oh, it's a bad neighborhood.  Holy ass.  Lowell.  Donna, what's up?  Donna.  Hi.  What's up?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  What do you got?  We're running out of show here, so you've got to be fast. 
[02:19:30]  It depends.  If you guys want shotguns, we'll do shotguns.  I've got a .38.  My husband's also got a handgun, or we can do shotguns.  Nice.  Double shotguns.  Just the shotguns?  Yeah.  Let's hear some shotguns first.  Okay.  He's getting ready.  Where are you guys?  In Buffalo?  Around Buffalo.  Nice.  All right.  On the outskirts there.  What's up?  I will guess Lackawanna.  No, Lockport.  Lockport.  Lockport.  All right.  There's some open fields up in Lockport.  Okay.  Here we go. 
[02:20:00]  Well, we're shooting right out of our backyard, so here we go.  All right.  There it goes.  How close is your neighbor?  Well, on one side, we don't have a neighbor for a while.  On the other side, they're, I don't know, maybe 100 feet, 200 feet.  Hey, break out the .38s, man.  Let me hear some of those.  You want to hear the .38?  Yeah.  It's not that big, though.  I know.  Let me just hear.  Okay.  Hang on.  There you go.  Thank you.  Hey, we're coming to Buffalo, I think, July 13th. 
[02:20:30]  Okay.  Keep listening to WBUF for all the details.  Okay.  Great.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Goddamn, I love weapons.  They're great.  Just love weapons, man.  So this is where we're at.  And we need Lady Di and Marion to call the show immediately.  We're trying?  All right.  If they're listening or someone knows how to get a hold of them, please do that for us  today.  Yeah.  So Starker Patty, out.  Gone.  Lady Di, possibly out.  Black girl, out.  Gone.  As we reorganize this stupid radio show, okay? 
[02:21:00]  As we thin the herd and bring in something that's been lacking on this program, a brand  new collection of characters.  Yes.  Tippi Tom is a keeper.  Oh, yeah.  The old homeless faggot.  He's a keeper.  Gotta love Tippi Tom.  I mean, when he started coming up with some of his quotes, this is one of my favorites.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot when two years old.  All right.  We love him.  And, of course, his medical knowledge.  Yeah.  You don't die of AIDS.  And this one. 
[02:21:30]  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  What is it with guys named Tom being complete alcoholic jokes?  So, there you go.  How you doing?  We had to lose Starker Patty to gain Tippi Tom.  See?  Also, I think wheelchair Fred is in.  Fred's gotta be in.  Oh, yeah.  Claiming he's not gay, he's just desperate.  He's desperate.  The guy, the way he talks and being in the wheelchair, girls won't go near him.  They're afraid of him.  So, he's not gay, but the only sex he can get is from guys. 
[02:22:00]  Because guys are so horny, they'll F anything.  And if you missed the 3 o'clock hour today, too bad, because he was telling us all about it.  He bends over for guys.  Guys bend over for him.  But he's not gay, because he's desperate.  He's just desperate.  So, I think he's in.  And now a lot of people are wondering if Larry has a spot on the show.  I think Larry does.  Jay from Pittsburgh, what's up?  Hey, yo.  What's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, I want to give a shout-out to Travis.  Travis, he knows who I'm talking about.  Are you listening on the ground? 
[02:22:30]  Because we're not in Pittsburgh yet.  No, no.  Actually, I'm at home in Redding, Pennsylvania.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's near Philly.  You want Larry to be on the show?  Yeah, Larry should definitely be a character, man.  All right.  Like, I don't know, man.  He's just like, I know too many, like, effed up war veterans.  And he just reminds me of every single one of them.  So, that's just definitely.  Yeah.  We'll have to make a decision.  There is a spot open right now, so.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I mean, you've got to bring in the herds and bring in the new people, so.  All right, Jay. 
[02:23:00]  All right.  Thank you.  We should be a call-in guy, call-in sometimes.  He's great.  Hey, Jessica.  Jessica.  It's Jennifer, I think.  Oh, Jennifer.  Hello.  Yo.  Who's this?  It's Bob, her boyfriend.  She's on the other line.  Hold on a second.  You date that?  Are you on the phone?  Yeah.  All right, talk to him.  Hello?  Hi, Jennifer.  Hi.  Hi.  Why are you talking crap about my picture?  I don't know.  What, uh...  Who's your picture?  Yeah, what contestant are you?  Which picture?  Contestant number 35 in the WOW Contest. 
[02:23:30]  Let's all go to opianthony.com and check out them.  See, I think she's cute.  Wait, let me...  And get that off the Wild Kingdom page.  I think she's cute.  Jennifer?  Yes?  How old are you?  20.  20?  Okay.  There you go.  And what have you heard so far on the show today?  Heard.  I don't know.  My boyfriend heard it.  He heard it this morning when he turned you guys on.  This morning?  That it was all gravy or something?  This afternoon.  Yeah, one of the pictures is grainy.  That was the intern took that picture. 
[02:24:00]  Ah, what an idiot.  Trust me, that's the best one.  See, he's an idiot.  Hey, uh, what's the boyfriend's name?  Bob.  Hey, Bob.  Hey.  Oh, yeah, that is a little bit blurry.  There is actually a point to that.  Well, um...  The Zapruder film was a clearer and sexier film.  Bob, are you willing to admit that Jennifer has some problems there or what?  Like what?  Well, she's got...  I've got to tell you, they're not the biggest, but they're perfect up close.  Yep.  I was thinking more about her tombstone teeth.  Ah, well, you know, not everybody can, you know, has parents that have money, you know? 
[02:24:30]  I mean, we're not all perfect.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, look.  Exactly.  So, you know, you've got to...  I mean, it's a wow contest.  It's about boobs.  Right.  That's what I said.  I'm preaching to the choir.  I agree with you.  It's not about rotting teeth.  You're right.  Jennifer.  Yeah.  So, uh, you want us to buy you some braces?  You know what?  You're going to buy me braces?  You're still young.  Well, you're going to buy me braces?  Well, we know any orthodontists here on the program? 
[02:25:00]  Maybe we can pull them out and start from scratch.  The picture definitely doesn't do it justice.  Our teeth are a little crooked, but they're definitely not bad.  Right.  Yeah, there's definitely some problems up top.  Now, let's move on to the boobs, everyone.  What does everyone think of the boobs?  See?  They're very perky.  They're perfect, I'm telling you.  Very perky.  They're very perky.  I'd give them a little tongue tussle.  There you go.  Thanks, Jim.  All right.  Now, disrespect me.  I know you're her boyfriend.  Oh, no.  Hey.  Bob, would you admit she needs to lose a couple pounds or what? 
[02:25:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, she could do a couple pounds, but, I mean, she's still got a great figure.  Jesus.  Ah, is this some chub?  There's some chub there.  Oh, jeez.  Just don't ever use the term great figure again after 1940.  No one says that.  Ben has a comment.  I think you're being overcritical.  Yeah, I think you're being a...  I think I hope he's being overcritical.  I'm being an idiot, right? 
[02:26:00]  Let's see.  Well, you know what?  Hold on, hold on.  Ben has something to say.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Ben.  I said switch the phone.  Oh, yeah, Ben.  That's all I said.  What about the shot where she has a coke, you know, covering up half her body?  What's that shot about?  About it.  We were just...  She was trying to...  I was trying to do different poses.  That's all.  Right.  Trying to do something different.  Yeah.  Be a little artistic.  Yeah.  I got to tell you, I forget his name.  I think his name was Bill.  Also sort of way. 
[02:26:30]  The guy, the producer down in Philly, I guess.  Yeah.  He really worked...  He helped her out, but the intern didn't really help that much.  Well, they don't...  He was new at it.  It was his first time.  What did the intern do?  He just...  He tried to take the pictures, but it was his first time, so he wasn't really...  He didn't realize to leave the lens cap.  Dude.  Yeah.  You know what?  I think you should take her down for a reshoot.  We could do that.  Yeah.  I would do that.  Take her down for a reshoot.  I think we need to punish YSP today, so why don't you bring your girlfriend back to 
[02:27:00]  the radio station?  We could do that?  Here's what I think.  Yeah.  Take her down for a reshoot.  She's got to lose...  Hmm.  Let's see.  Lose the...  Lose the face.  No.  Lose the top.  Well, you know what?  Hey, Opie.  Jesus, Opie.  If it was truly a wow contest, there shouldn't be any faces involved.  Oh.  It should be from the neck down.  Bob, I am helping you out here.  Some girls are choosing to take just shots of their boobs.  I'm saying when people see your girlfriend's face, it takes... 
[02:27:30]  There's some, you know, demurics there.  No, I think the face actually should be in the picture because...  I think her boobs are like...  Here, go back, Ben.  Her boobs are, I would have to say, an eight.  Right, at least.  But then when you see face, you've got to go down to like a four.  Oh.  Oh, my God, Opie.  No, I think the face actually helps because when people vote, they like to see...  You know what?  I was really hoping...  No, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You guys, now you guys are putting me down.  I'm not putting you down.  Yes, you are, Jim.  I am not putting you down. 
[02:28:00]  Please, I'd strap all over you.  It's all Opie.  He's the evil one.  Right.  Dude, I'm saying that I think the face...  No, I'm the honest one.  People have voted.  People like to see the face when they vote.  They like to see the whole gal.  Right.  And, you know, I think...  Believe me, Marlon Perkins is there today.  He'd be more than happy to take a couple of shots.  He should head down.  I don't know if we can make it today, but maybe tomorrow.  I don't know.  Will Jim Fowler be there tomorrow?  Did you say Marlon Perkins?  Take her down.  You know, I would...  I don't know.  I would...  You know, I would back up a few steps before taking the pictures. 
[02:28:30]  You know, get the camera guy there to back up a little bit.  Well, is Edwin Hubble of element?  Preferably have him back up to Cleveland.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, but you know something.  I'm going to break one off of you, Opie.  Yeah.  And well, you should.  Here's what you got to do.  Go down for the reshoot.  None of the coat on the shoulder thing.  Lose the skirt, too.  I think if you were wearing, like, a thong and nothing else, that would be cool.  Look, we want to punch Philly. 
[02:29:00]  And better.  Oh, shut up.  And the last couple contests, the Philly girls blew the New York girls away.  I agree.  I got to tell you.  You know what?  But this time around, we're kicking Philly's ass, my friend.  Oh, I don't know about that.  No one has kicked Dallas's ass yet, but New York is faring a little better than Philly.  Have your girlfriend run around the block a few times, too, before we'll shoot.  Oh, thanks.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You know, I love you guys so much, and now I can't stand you.  Hey, it's just Opie.  I think you're cute.  Yeah, just cute. 
[02:29:30]  Well, I love you, Anthony.  And I don't know where he's coming from here.  I just think you ought to go for a reshoot.  I'm coming from a planet called Reality.  You're a cold-blooded bastard, Opie.  Opie.  You're mean.  Opie is just mean.  He is mean.  He's just plain old mean.  That was uncalled for.  It should just be the Jim and Anthony.  No, no, because then it would be too nice and sugary. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, right?  I'm from the Galaxy, Slim Fast.  Come on, now.  That's enough.  Come on.  She's not.  She's a cute girl.  She's very cute.  Bonnie!  No, I think...  Go for a reshoot, dude, because these pictures, I can tell they're not doing her justice.  All right.  All right.  And make sure she closes her mouth.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  You shouldn't be subject to that.  You called up asking her advice. 
[02:30:30]  I'm helping you out a little bit.  And let me tell you what's bad.  See that last picture on there?  With her top off and you're kind of looking to the side?  That's a horrible pose for you to be in.  It doesn't show off what you look like.  Your arms are straight down.  You've got to be...  Like, put your legs straight out like you're trying to stop the car, like through the floor.  You just...  All right.  We'll take a ride up there tomorrow and take a reshoot.  Yeah, take a reshoot, man.  No one will help you is if you could get the guy just to focus right in on the boobs, and 
[02:31:00]  that's it.  I think you'd have a really good shot.  Hey, I'm telling you, as far as being good boobs, those are as good as anything you got  up there.  Absolutely.  I'm telling you, they're at least eights, maybe nine.  Oh, yeah.  They're just as good as Parker's.  What are they?  Are they...  What are you...  I'm going to guess.  Let me see.  Are you like...  What are you...  I would say a 38B, but I don't know if that's possible.  What are they?  They Bs?  Yeah, Jennifer, what's your measurement?  Are they Cs?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  38C?  30...  30...  36C.  36C.  Very nice. 
[02:31:30]  And how long have you guys been going out?  A year.  Cool.  Aw.  Well, it must be the sex next.  Cute.  No, she's a good girl, and she is very attractive.  The pictures don't do her justice.  No, I don't photograph well, either.  I definitely understand that.  Right.  Not that you'll be on eatabullet.com looking at my pictures.  I'm just saying, if you happen to go by there.  I'm there every day.  All right.  Well, good luck to you all.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  Hey, can we get some tickets for Jim Norton down in A.C.? 
[02:32:00]  Oh, that'd be nice.  Yeah.  YSP should have them, yes.  I think we could get some seats in the back row there.  Oh, my God.  Wouldn't want to scare Jim, right?  We'd love that.  Now, you come up and say hello after the show.  We'd love to have you on July 27th in A.C.  Okay.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  I don't know if he gets his number or something.  I think the Taliban had a good idea there.  All right.  Thank you, Bob and Jennifer.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  We love you guys.  Bye.  There they go.  There's no... 
[02:32:30]  I'm going to shoot out the window for you.  I'm going to go to the window and you want me to aim at somebody or in the air?  You can't shoot a gun off in Newark for shooting people. 
[02:33:00]  I'm in the projects.  There's too many people around.  What's the heck?  There's too many people around.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the cops are not out here, so don't worry about that.  Oh, stop it.  We're only looking for gunfire.  Oh, you're Mongo's friend.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, the drug dealer guy.  The drug dealer that waits for all the kids to go home and then sells his crack around the  schoolyard.  Yeah.  You want me to shoot it?  No.  I won't shoot anybody.  I'll just go in the air.  No.  It comes down.  Yeah.  All right, and listen, check it out, man.  You guys, I've been working hard to give you street credibility, and then you say Asbury 
[02:33:30]  Park is tough.  That's a tough neighborhood, my friend.  Man, no.  We go down there when we need guns and money.  Those people, we take their guns from them.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Bye.  By the way, there's another new contestant up on opandanthony.com from D.C.  Oh, is there?  Yes.  Lovely lady.  Check her out for yourself.  It's the wow contest, man.  We got a few new contestants today.  We're still qualifying girls, so all you have to do is show up at the station.  The station takes your photos, and they send them off to us, and we put them up on opandanthony.com.  Eventually, one girl's going to walk away with $5,000 courtesy of risquevideo.com. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  There's a tidy little prize.  I can't get this picture off.  I'm fresh.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  That girl, Jessica?  Yeah.  They should reshoot her with a semi-automatic.  All right.  Thank you.  Which?  That, you know, you people are cruel and unusual.  Okay.  You don't have to.  I thought that a couple of the pictures looked good.  It was just that the poses needed a little bit of work. 
[02:34:30]  That's what I'm thinking.  That's why I think they should go down and get the reshoot.  Yeah, that's it.  I've seen Rick work magic in here with the girls.  Well, yeah, but, you know.  Right?  Well, yeah.  Magic is not a miracle.  Go find a funhouse mirror.  Maybe it'll all work out.  What do we learn next?  Joe, you're on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, you guys room, man.  We're trying.  What's going on today?  You want to hear my pistol?  Yeah.  You guys got some lame callers.

How's that?  Rapid fire.  What is that, a nine?  Smith & Wesson, 57 automatic.  Nice.  And where do you live that you can just shoot it off like that?  I just shot that in my basement.  Where do you live, though?  Yeah, New Jersey.  There you go.

I'm going to shoot my potato gun for you guys.  Pretty quickly, describe a potato gun to people.  Okay.  It's about six feet high.  Mm-hmm.  You jam a potato down the barrel. 
[02:37:30]  You put hairspray or right guard in the chamber.  And you have a source of ignition, like a grill spark or something.  All right.  Well, we don't condone this.  Yeah, well, it's pretty loud.  Let me hear.  Okay.  Hold on one second.  Okay.  And there's a train going by somewhere.  Kids, this is very illegal.  Don't try it at home.  Okay.

All right.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  Full tussle.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Oh, I learned to always wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle.

We only have a few minutes left from the show, but Jamie wants in here.  What's up, Jamie?  Jamie?  Jamie?  We lose you?  Are you there?  Girl who wants to do 6 o'clock queef, are you there?  Oh, we lost her.  All right.  Will, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I was just saying that if you guys had boobs and guns, you'd have your demographic 
[02:39:30]  at half mass for four hours.  Love you, Ant.  Love you, Jim.  Love you, O.  All right.  Thank you, Will.  Godspeed, son.  Jerry from Medicine.  I learned the NRA could have sponsored today's show.  He also learned the O&A Army are better armed than most countries.  Chris from Boston.  Listen, I learned today that Vietnam vet Larry is a true American hero and his cure for flashbacks  is Budweiser, Pot, Zoloft, and a cache of automatic weapons.  God bless America.  God bless America.  I think we're just about done. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Bang up show.  I like that.  My favorite, the AR-15.  God damn.  Bat, bat, bat, bat, bat, bat, bat.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, we can end with the FU line today.  What the hell?  Something a little different.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, all right?  Later.  Oh, what, what?  Go fast.  No?  Oh.  Did you get me, really?  He totally just nailed you, man.  He totally got you.  Norton is brilliant with that.  I know you need a plug and stuff.  He looks and goes, no, no, no, thank you, no, but I'll plug tomorrow. 
[02:40:30]  Who cares about Atlantic City?  He doesn't, he didn't think I needed a plug.  I just got him and he wanted me to do something.  But I'm a whore.  July 27th, Atlantic City.  So I didn't get you.  You didn't get me.  I knew, I knew you would have to take it back if you could resist, yeah.  All right, it's got to be honest.  We have to plug.  But then again, since I did take it back, Westbury, September 7th.  All right, the F.U. line is coming to live again.  So why don't we go there and we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the Opian Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, I want to give a big F.U. to me for getting myself $25,000 in debt. 
[02:41:00]  And I also want to give a big F.U. to the credit card company to open me a settlement for half.  You douchebag.  You don't want me to think if I had half, I would have been paying it the whole time.  You see, sucking a-hole faggot.  Next message.  I want to give a big F.U. to the city of Trenton for being a bunch of effed-up a-holes  and not posting street signs or route numbers to tell you how to get out of the city  and then you feel like you're about to get killed.  Because every time you stop on a street corner, there's 50 people around your vehicle. 
[02:41:30]  F.U. City of Trenton.  Post some goddamn street signs so people from out of town know where the f*** they're going.  Next message.  I want to send a F.U. out to that ignorant, stupid, fat, slanty-eyed, pig-faced lady died.  How dare she insult the American people by not knowing common facts and historic events,  which anybody who wants to come into this country takes pride and works every night to become a U.S. citizen.  She probably doesn't even know the friggin' plenum leaves on a flag or my country's his or thee. 
[02:42:00]  She should get a kick in your ass out of this country back to Germany  where the British fought the French for the American Revolution.  Get it, you dumb douchebag.  Ah!  Ah!  You pig!  End of messages. </pre>
