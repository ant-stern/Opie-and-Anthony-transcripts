<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy reconciliation between Opie and Andrew Dice Clay, facilitated by Kenny, who was present in the studio throughout this segment.  The initial conversation, peppered with humor, touched upon morbid hypotheticals (Bob Kelly needing CPR), body hair and its perceived connection to homosexuality, and the societal double standard regarding naked children versus pubescent children.  The main focus, however, was a detailed airing of grievances between Opie and Dice Clay spanning several years.  Their conflict encompassed Dice Clay's past anger, communication breakdowns, Dice’s divorce, a perceived betrayal involving Kenny, and the handling of a career-related problem for Kenny. Numerous personal anecdotes and inside jokes fueled the discussion, which frequently veered into tangents about other individuals and events.  The segment concluded with an apparent resolution and a shared sense of nostalgia.

The conversation continued with Opie, Anthony, and Dice Clay, joined by occasional listener calls.  Further discussion revolved around Dice Clay's relationship with Opie, past experiences, and communication issues. Anecdotes included Dice Clay's anxieties about a Venetian show (exacerbated by his manager), the fallout from a past radio ban (possibly linked to a “Sex with Sam” segment), and more personal experiences shared between Opie and Dice.  Dice Clay’s comedic style provided humorous moments, alongside a running bit about an underwater phone and his non-smoking cigarette habit.  A significant portion of the discussion involved humorous observations about bands replacing deceased or departed lead singers (Boston, Styx, Foreigner, Journey, Alice in Chains).  E-Rock contributed a comedic remix of Foundry songs to the mix. The segment ended with Dice Clay showing a picture of a planned date – a news traffic reporter.

The show then shifted to a more rambling, vulgar conversation sparked by a photo of Jill Nicolini, who frequently appeared alongside Anthony in online searches.  This transitioned into a crude discussion about pubic hair.  Elaborate, often unbelievable prank stories ("effects") followed, including convincing one friend he was Superman and another that a two-inch woman was in his dresser drawer. A tense discussion, bordering on reconciliation, took place between Opie and Jim Norton, addressing past hurt and betrayal. Comedian Jim Brewer joined, recounting his experiences at a Spinal Tap concert, including interactions with other celebrities and the band's perceived rudeness.  Nick DiPaolo then joined, sharing his observations on the emasculation of men in commercials.

Nick DiPaolo continued as a guest, discussing his views on societal biases against men in media. He cited examples from commercials, movies, and sitcoms, highlighting what he perceived as a trend portraying men negatively while women are depicted positively.  He referenced specific commercials and films, including examples of racial stereotypes.  Jim Jefferies then joined, recounting a harrowing home invasion where he and a friend were robbed at knifepoint, and his girlfriend threatened with rape. Despite the seriousness, Jefferies found humor in aspects of the experience.  The conversation shifted to gun laws in the UK and the US, prompted by Anthony's recent firearm purchase, and Anthony's detailed discussion of his gun collection and views on gun ownership. Jamie Kennedy joined, discussing his new movie, "The Heckler," and shared anecdotes about his experiences with hecklers, both online and in person, including near-physical altercations and a chance encounter with George Lucas.  Bobby Kelly interjected with off-color comments, including a sexually explicit account of his PalTalk broadcast.


Jamie Kennedy continued to discuss "The Heckler," highlighting footage of critics being physically confronted by the film's director, Uwe Boll.  He also mentioned attempts to include footage of Bill Burr confronting hecklers. The show then interviewed Ricky Gervais, discussing the Oscars, Gervais’s views on American self-centeredness, *The Office*, his podcast with Stephen Merchant and Carl Pilkington (highlighting Pilkington's unintelligence and fascinating nature), and his work on *Extras*.  Finally, the hosts spoke with Patrick Carlin, George Carlin's brother, discussing George's death, his final wishes regarding the disposal of his ashes, and anecdotes about his life and work habits.  Jim Norton, Robert Kelly, and Greg Giraldo were mentioned as being in the studio during this segment.  The conversation included Norton’s recollections of working with George Carlin and Patrick Carlin's sharing stories about George’s personality, his health struggles, views on religion, and his comedic approach.


A phone call with Patrick Carlin further explored George Carlin's comedic genius and the impact of his death.  Patrick shared anecdotes about George's childhood and approach to comedy.  They discussed George's final special and his introduction of Patrick to marijuana, with Patrick stating his intention to continue smoking until he dies. The conversation then transitioned to the "Angry Video Game Nerd," with clips from several reviews being played (including "Top Gun," "Back to the Future," and various Atari porn games).  The Angry Video Game Nerd was then interviewed by phone, discussing his reviews, the games he plays, and the reasons behind their poor quality and popularity.


The show concluded with a phone interview with James Rolfe, the Angry Video Game Nerd.  He discussed early video game history, unauthorized Christian games for Nintendo, his video reviews, increasing popularity, other work, and websites (cinemassacre.com, angryvgnerd.com, screwattack.com). Opie and Anthony noted his YouTube success and his quiet demeanor on the phone, contrasting it with his animated video persona.  The show ended with the hosts reiterating Rolfe's website information and a crude, sexually suggestive outro.

[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:30]  We'll be right back.  It feels like somebody punched my heart, like took my heart out, punched it, and then 
[00:03:00]  put it back in.  A nice piece of plaque comes out right now.  Oh, God.  You guys would just let me lie there until you move over to XM.  The Tim Russert special.  That brings up an interesting question.  Let's say you needed mouth-to-mouth.  Is there a person in the studio that would do that for Bob Kelly?  Sam would run in here as quick as it would happen and put his little lion cub mouth right on my lips. 
[00:03:30]  I forgot you have a crush on Sam.  Lion cub mouth?  I forgot that Bobby has a real-life crush on Sam.  Actually, I think I'm moving over to his brother now because Sam has chest hair.  That bugs me.  That makes it gay.  I'm not gay.  Of course not.  No.  No.  Not the way you talk about attractive Brazilian men bringing you meat.  Yeah, but Sam, like he has chest hair, I heard.  Young Sam.  And that's gay.  I don't want to.  Bob, you kissed me on the lips. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, but you kissed me.  You didn't pull back.  And he's got whiskers.  No, he doesn't.  Yeah, he does.  Look, he's got a full...  You can grow a full beard, right?  I'm 24 years old.  You do?  Can I see you?  He's got to say I'm 24 years old.  He's got one of those bumpy beards.  He's got a few of those.  Yeah, yeah.  What, razor bumps?  Yeah, it's called wrapper neck.  What is your chest?  Do you get a lot of hair?  No.  No. 
[00:04:30]  Let me see.  No, it's none of your business, actually.  Let me just see.  Why?  Just pull up your shirt for him.  I'll turn away.  Let me just see.  Just for Bobby.  Go ahead.  The mic is in the middle of your chest.  Go over there.  There you go.  You can see from here.  What's wrong with his chest?  See that little patch of hair?  This is for pal talk.  See that little patch of hair?  Ew.  Bobby.  Around his nipples, too, which makes him manly.  He's not boy-like anymore.  Can I put my shirt down?  Yeah, you do.  You've got to throw him back now, right, Bobby?  Yeah, he's no good. 
[00:05:00]  He's no good anymore.  He's damaged goods now?  He's no good.  He's got that little patch above his belly button, which-  You're one of those guys that would abuse a child and then have to face them when they  get older and have hair.  And be like, hey, how you doing?  I don't know what it is, though.  Pubes really do make a guy dirty.  What?  What are you talking about?  Say you're at the beach and you saw a little kid running down the beach, a little boy naked, 
[00:05:30]  and he's got nothing.  No pubes.  And then all of a sudden, you see that kid.  You can't just let-  If you have pubes, it's dirty.  If you have no pubes, it's kind of like, hey, look at that little thing.  Look at him justifying.  Holy mother of God.  Pubes are what you can't-  I don't really feel like saying goodbye to a 25-year broadcasting career because of  your sick mind, Bob.  I'm not saying that I like-  What are you talking about?  That's pedophilia crap.  I don't know what that means.  That means get the F out of the studio. 
[00:06:00]  Your time is done.  I do believe what he's saying is that a lot of times parents will let their children  run down the beach disrobed.  Right, and it's not bad.  And it's acceptable like that.  But the second you show any type of maturity happening, where it's hair or anything like  that, that it becomes dirty and you must cover it up.  Thank you, Anthony, for explaining it and saving me from that movement he did.  This comes from experience, then. 
[00:06:30]  You see parents with kids that might be too old to still be naked.  Think about that, though.  You see kids at the beach and it's like they're running around naked and it's not a real big  deal.  Nobody's saying anything.  It's just, okay, whatever.  It's a little kid.  But as soon as he gets a couple whiskers, it's like, ah, put that away.  I always thought it was kind of like creepy to see kids naked.  Always.  Yeah, always.  Always.  I think it's-  I mean, I got a lot of nephews and nieces and every once in a while one's running around  naked and I always found it kind of creepy, to be honest. 
[00:07:00]  Even though they're still very young and all that.  Yeah.  And it's just that it's an innocent baby naked thing.  But it's still like, it's a little weird to me.  I wouldn't even take pictures at Christmas with my little cousins on my lap because I'm  in like pajama bottoms and they're on my lap and I just get away.  Just no, no pictures with me.  Just sit on the floor.  Sure, I'll tap the top of your head.  Hey, let's go to the FU line. 
[00:07:30]  Hey, what's up?  It's-  What are you talking about?  Oh, right then.  Hey, what's up?  It's Bob Kelly.  Go to robertkellylive.com and find out when I'm coming to your town.  Again, that's robertkellylive.com or go to my MySpace, myspace slash robertkellylive.  You want to find out when I'm coming back to your town or fuck me.  All my dates and info are up on either one of those.  So make sure you check them out and come down to one of my shows.  Later, bitches.  All right, do it one more time.  No, I want to do that.  I want to do that one more time.  I want this one.  Ready?  Hey, what's up?  It's Bob Kelly.  If you want to- 
[00:08:00]  Every knee must bend.  Every head must bow.  Every tongue must confess.  Thou art the greatest.  The greatest of all time.  Ella.  Ella.  A.  A.  Yeah, we suck.  Opie and Anthony, y'all.  Opie and Anthony.  But what about the picture me and you after the garden show, just me and you in the empty  garden?  Yeah.  How great is that?  It's a beautiful picture.  As we're having that moment, you're mad at me because of this mask thing.  No, but I wasn't mad at that moment. 
[00:08:30]  You had to wait to be mad?  Yeah.  That was an incredible night.  Ann, help me out of here.  No, but why wouldn't-  I don't like you.  Anthony, please, you keep interrupting.  You really just, you got to stop already.  This is between us.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right.  People put anger down sometimes and it comes back at a weird time.  I think sometimes that's what happens.  That's the thing I'm trying to understand because all I wanted for the last few years  was a reason why you were mad at me.  And you never would give it.  Well, I'm telling you the reason.  How it came out is how it came out.  I never left messages, but I did call cell phone numbers I had for you. 
[00:09:00]  I got nothing from you.  No, I did not leave messages because I was like, well, if he picks up the phone, I'm  going to ask him.  At least tell me why.  And I would have.  All right.  But you didn't tell me why.  But I would have.  We sabotaged your brother Wee's interview and you hung up.  Whatever.  That's fine.  But, Ann, do you get this?  That was not-  You know what?  The Wee's thing was something that Norton brought to my attention.  And the reason I hung up was that was not the time to do this on someone else's show. 
[00:09:30]  That's why when Jimmy brought this up, I'm like, all right, I'll come up there.  I don't get a problem.  You know I never have a problem facing anybody.  It's just when it happens.  Get Anthony's point of view.  Because sometimes I'm looked at as like the lunatic, the hothead.  But, Ann, what's your hothead?  I understand.  What's your thoughts on this?  I see Dice was angry, and he's a complete lunatic, so it took two years for the anger  to come out.  Yeah.  How come he understands that?  You can't get past it. 
[00:10:00]  Because I'm like, you know what?  I'm reactionary.  If I'm mad, I can't hold it in for two years.  I can't hold it in for 20 seconds.  What?  Well, no, I unload also, constantly.  Right.  But that's a different story.  It was fester for years when one phone call would have taken care of it, and we could  have still done the radio part of it.  No, one call wasn't going to take care of it, because, number one, you went through something  terrible.  Right.  Yeah, so what should I do?  No, you could have called me before the terrible thing, because we were hanging out there.  You know, I don't have...  Can you get the dates? 
[00:10:30]  No, you don't need dates.  No, exactly.  But you do know that we ran into each other.  No, I know we hung out.  Not a lot, but a couple times at the comedy store.  Yeah, you came out to the comedy store.  We went to the gym.  You were excited.  Honestly, you were excited to see me.  We did a whole day together.  We went to the supermarket together.  We did a little shopping as you were in your silly outfit.  You couple of faggots.  Holy shit.  Not silly enough?  No, you're rocking.  You know.  Yeah.  You're rocking, but...  Come all that. 
[00:11:00]  Come all that.  Come all that.  And we went to the Gold's Gym and worked out for maybe seven minutes, and then we went  on a hike, and we had all these moments.  We sat in the temporary apartment you had to get because, you know, you were going through  a time yourself at that point.  Yeah.  What?  Do you think that ever ends?  I don't know.  That doesn't end.  It doesn't end, investors.  You obviously handle it differently.  I'm like, you know, I see it as a lot of, you know, opportunities there to, like, discuss  this.  This Max thing.  All right. 
[00:11:30]  So we're discussing it.  Years later.  Yeah.  Well, I was going through something myself.  I don't even know you anymore.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but you do.  That doesn't come...  I didn't see Norton for a few years.  We just started talking.  That's what happened.  He's the same creep he always was.  It was the same thing.  Sitting at the diner was the same...  We haven't done that in years.  Right.  It was the exact same thing.  What about going to the deli here?  How many memories you want to bring up?  How about when we went sweatshirt shopping?  I remember that.  What about when we picked out silverware and we were going to move in together?  What about discussing window treatments in my old joint? 
[00:12:00]  Remember, medium or well done.  Remember, you told Kenny...  Which way?  Oh, that's...  Remember, you bet a Bosco.  You bet.  No.  Bosco.  Yeah, and then I say you bet.  Yeah.  What?  You bet a Bosco.  You...  Bosco.  You bet.  See?  But you messed it up.  I know.  Remember, you...  It's been a while.  I forgot.  I totally forgot that.  Oh, yeah.  I love that one.  Which way?  You bet a Bosco?  Bosco.  No.  You bet. 
[00:12:30]  You bet.  Remember, you let the...  You made Kenny sit in the limo to walk around my new...  Remember the time?  Medium or well done, also.  Where me and you were walking in the street.  Sure.  And we were talking about some heavy stuff.  Discussing, yeah, the...  Yeah.  See?  That's heavy.  That's shame.  The thing?  Did you...  Wait a minute.  What?  You're...  You're not single.  I'm getting married in November.  See, we haven't talked in a long time.  No, the old one was... 
[00:13:00]  To a man, too, which is really odd.  Yeah, it's been a while.  The old one is long gone, and my new girl is amazing.  They're all amazing at this point.  Let me just say this, just to get off of remember when we...  Remember when?  When we weeded the garden together.  You really getting married again?  I never was married.  All right, but you're getting married.  Yeah.  All right.  I got engaged.  Right?  You're engaged now?  I was.  You know how angry that made my wife when that happened? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, that'll do it.  So, you know...  Amy, that's not far from the truth.  But then...  Bring home a girlfriend.  Then you end the engagement.  I mean, how far are you going to take something like that?  Are you really going to marry her?  Are you going to go through it?  I want...  Even though he's not a little Max anymore, because I've seen...  I've seen him on TV and stuff.  He's a big boy now.  But I want my own Max.  You don't get a...  All right.  If you're going to get married, I know how people are when they're going to do that.  Remember this. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  No matter what kind of hatred winds up building between the two of you...  Mm-hmm.  You hear why he's laughing?  Because he knows.  Oh, yeah.  He's been there.  Yeah.  No, because he knows what's coming.  Yeah.  You know, so enjoy those first couple weeks.  No matter what happens when the disdain sets in, when all the little things that you loved  about her make you just absolutely despise her, like when all of a sudden they're sitting  with a fucking box of Cheez-Its on the bed crunching with the bun in her hair and no 
[00:14:30]  makeup and walking around the house with fucking flip-flops hitting the back of her fucking  feet, where all those cute things fucking make you want to vomit, at that moment in time,  don't ever think of divorcing her, ever.  Because if you do have your own little Max's, even after the divorce, the settlement, the  alimony, the child support, and you could turn around to Anthony and go, boy, I'm glad  that's all over, that's when it first begins. 
[00:15:00]  Because now all they're left with is the anger and the hatred for you that maybe you do have  a new girlfriend that you like and that you're getting into.  So no matter what she does, when you're married to her, you can't get mad.  Like, if in the middle of the night she was angry, maybe during dinner, and she takes an  electric saw and cuts off your foot, you look at her and go, oh, that must have been 
[00:15:30]  an accident.  I didn't really like that foot anyway.  That's my bad foot.  That foot's a, how did you know?  I love you.  If she cuts your whole fucking leg off, go, I love you for that, because you knew it was  itching.  You know, shit like that.  Never, ever leave.  Get a thousand girlfriends, get them apartments, whatever the fuck they want, bury your stuff  your fucking balls right up that fucking pirate's eye.  Just don't ever leave the wife. 
[00:16:00]  Always look at her and smile and go, you're the fucking best.  You got it?  And you'll be thanking me a couple years from now?  Yeah.  You'll thank me.  The anger and the expense that goes along with the divorce is ridiculous.  There's no other, you could be, an astronaut doesn't have as much stress and pressure on  him as a guy going through a divorce.  It's just the worst fucking thing.  You get to the point where you're frothing at the mouth that you're so angry with another 
[00:16:30]  human being that you just, you're wishing, and not just, I wish that person was dead.  You're wishing actual death on people just so this ends, just so it like ends.  And, and the, the, the like physical stress.  I actually used to do the joke about that.  And I was even in love at the time.  You know what I mean?  I say, you know, when I, it's not even about marriage.  I go, when I break up with a girl, you know, I just like, I'm dead. 
[00:17:00]  Like, this way, you know, you're not going to run into him at the grocery.  You know, nobody's going to come back and say, oh, you know what she said about you?  After you know, you've been clobbering her with your fucking cock for years.  You know what I mean?  Nobody's, nobody's going to come back.  Right.  Why'd you move the mic when you wanted to laugh?  What?  I was just, see, you don't even know what you just did.  I'm fucking around, but I'm saying, you know, so I would say that because it does, it just 
[00:17:30]  gets brutal.  Even if it's a girlfriend or somebody, maybe you fucked one or two times by accident.  You know what I mean?  Shit like that.  You know, it just never ends.  Yeah.  But you, you can't talk anyone out of it.  Not that I would.  I mean, no, I don't want to talk.  Lindsay's great girl.  She's a nice girl.  And that, but the whole, I don't understand how anyone gets married these days.  No matter how much you feel about the person, the married thing is, it just amazes me.  I've seen too much grief come out of it. 
[00:18:00]  And even the happiness, the happily married people, they joke about being miserable all  the time.  Are you making a big wedding?  Are you doing that?  Yeah.  Ugh.  Ugh.  By then, you know, everybody hates everybody anyway.  But did you do the big wedding back in the day?  No.  I don't, no.  No.  We went, Kenny, you even remember, right?  We went one day.  Kenny wasn't there, but it was like a week I wasn't in concert, to be quite honest.  Right.  And I said, why don't, because I wanted to marry her for a couple of years.  So we went, you know, just to a temple. 
[00:18:30]  You know, I had a little talk with the rabbi.  But you're from Brooklyn.  You're like Italian, I thought.  Oh, no.  He's got to be an ass.  It's not about, what are you, it's stopping my flow.  I'm trying to tell you something.  It was just, it was a rabbi.  It was some of the rabbi's friends that were hanging around, you know, for a witness.  And, you know, we went for lunch.  Then we went home and went to sleep.  We already had a kid.  Yeah.  That's nice.  My kid had the best time. 
[00:19:00]  He had a better honeymoon than me.  We went to Hawaii.  They worked for you.  And I never saw a kid have so much fun.  I was miserable.  Hey.  Yeah.  With the non-speaking lady that came with us, you know, whatever the fuck she was, nanny  or whatever.  Is it a nanny?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Non-speaking.  So, I'm just getting off our argument for a minute.  You're right.  You know.  It's fine.  I'm not going back to that.  But what's up with poor Kenny?  Kenny doesn't know why you hate him.  I don't know.  I don't really.  What could you say to poor Kenny over there?  If I had to say it quick, you know, what really bugged me, because Kenny, you know, 
[00:19:30]  well, we're not close today, but his dry hair, I looked at Kenny as one of my best friends.  Like, you looked at me as a friend.  Right.  And I don't know.  I don't want to do it on the air because, you know what I mean?  It's I don't want to say the other person's name.  He might know without.  Maybe you're talking code.  Maybe you're talking code.  All right.  Because Kenny. 
[00:20:00]  So, Kenny, you know, when Max had his bar mitzvah.  Double talk.  All right.  So, Max flying in, right?  Kenny, you're scared of him.  No.  No, this is it.  At Max's bar mitzvah.  Right.  At his bar mitzvah, which, you know, Kenny went up and he did stuff on, you know, the  pulpit, the whole thing, because he's one of my best friends.  But at that, you know, at the bar mitzvah, he mentioned somebody.  I talked about some of my ex-wife's friends that didn't show up. 
[00:20:30]  I was like, you see, they didn't even back her up at this.  And these are people I fought about.  And he brought up one in particular and said, I talk to her a lot.  And Kenny knows him.  You know, I am about loyalty with my friends.  And I felt that was any.  And I just looked at him.  I didn't want to argue with him because there was a bar mitzvah happening.  And it really just bothered me that you were having conversations with her.  Because you told me you talked to her a lot.  You know who I'm talking about.  So two years later, you got upset with him?  A girl from the Northeast?  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  And it was like she was hanging with my.  She took, like, the side of the wife.  And Kenny's my friend.  And I would confide in him.  And you know what?  You know, he's never been through a divorce.  And I hope you never do go through a divorce.  But when you're divorced.  Are you really?  No.  When did that happen?  What the fuck?  So it just bothered me.  And I said, in my mind, I, you know, I just couldn't be friends.  Because I'm like, here's somebody I totally confide in. 
[00:21:30]  I even, one thing I will bring up that I, I was screaming at him one day.  Because he actually told, I think it was Norton that I was getting divorced.  Right?  And we talked about this yesterday.  And I flipped out going, why the fuck?  You know, this, I could say, why the fuck would you tell Norton?  Anything that's going on, you know, with my wife.  Why would you do that?  If I want to tell him I'm getting fucking divorced, I'll be the one to tell him.  Right.  You know, but, you know, look, everybody's got their own personality.  Personality. 
[00:22:00]  But the point.  No, but, so, he didn't do it maliciously.  But it was something I wouldn't do.  You know what I mean?  So it really bothered me.  Why didn't you explain that to him?  Because I was really angry.  It was like, with, not the Norton thing.  The Norton thing I said to him, we were in Vegas at the time.  But that's the ongoing theme today.  It's like, okay, we get it.  But why don't you explain this to people that are, quote, your friends?  Because I looked at it as, you are my friend, and you know you're talking to this person, 
[00:22:30]  and now you told me you are, you know, and, you know, I'm having him, you know, in the  ceremony for my kid's bar mitzvah.  And, you know, through all the years, you know, there were times Kenny didn't work for me,  that we'd fight, you know, and I would bring him back because he was my friend.  Right.  There was even a time where my ex-wife would say, why don't you just fucking fire him?  I go, what do you mean?  You're talking like I know the guy for a day.  He's my friend.  You know what I mean?  You just don't fire your fucking friend. 
[00:23:00]  I mean, you know, 15 years before that, who cares?  And even then, in a month, he was working for me again.  Because I liked him, and we built the friendship.  But, you know, 15 years later, what do you mean?  Just fire him?  Just call me, you're fired.  Right.  This isn't a job with a corporation.  I'm a fucking comic.  I got more angry at Huff for saying that, you know, because he was somebody that watched  my back all those years.  That was my joke.  You know, I'm just reworking it.  It worked that time.  I missed this. 
[00:23:30]  I missed the big joke.  He said I got angry at her, and he said, what did you tell her, three years later?  See, because you hold the anger in so long.  No, but I didn't hold it in with her.  See, I could be fine with her.  No, of course not.  Now, that I see.  Yeah, that I...  You did, too.  See, I think Dice figures also.  No, so...  Why is it always Dice's job to have to call people and have to talk?  No, but wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  So, anyway, that's what happened.  That's why I was angry with Kenny.  I mean, I saw him today.  I'm glad to see you today. 
[00:24:00]  I'm glad I'm up here.  You know, just like, even when I made up with Stern, I didn't go in to fight.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you want to talk it out?  You want to put it behind us or not?  You know, that's how I am.  Because, you know, it is, life is, you know, it's fucking temporary, and, you know, if there  are people you like, sooner or later, you got to make up with them.  That's it.  Or else it's a waste.  If you don't have your friends, if I'm...  You know, Jameson's with me all the time.  Florentine, when he's not headlining, will work with me.  You know, he doesn't even look to take money from me when he works. 
[00:24:30]  We just like being together.  Right, right.  You know, I mean, you know, thank God Norton's career took off.  You know what I mean?  And he's doing phenomenal.  And I was glad to see that.  You know, and I'm glad I was part of pushing him a little that he opened for me and met  you guys.  And now he's got, you know, his own career.  That's great.  Well, people need to know...  I was actually angry when Kenny was...  Jim's on the show because of you.  Let me finish his statement.  Jim's on the show because of you.  No, no, but I'm not taking credit for...  I'm just saying it's a shame that we haven't been talking because if I'm fighting with 
[00:25:00]  you guys, well, you know, can't call Morton because, you know, he's in that camp.  You know, and it's really stupid, especially because we are people that make the whole country  laugh.  You know, I mean, even when 9-11 happened, you guys had to go on the air.  You know what I mean?  It was all you guys that had to, you know, keep it moving and try to make whatever relief  you could make happen for people.  You know, think if there was no radio, if there were no comics, if there, you know, 
[00:25:30]  you can't just keep it a constant battle.  When I go on stage, my anger is funny because it's fake anger.  It's an angry comic.  But if you go on with real anger, and there were a couple years I did go on that way,  I wasn't funny because I meant every word.  I really did hate going on stage.  I was going through an awful marriage, divorce, whatever the fuck it was.  Because obviously I'm not too fucking mad now.  You know what I mean? 
[00:26:00]  I've gotten past a lot of fucking things.  You sure did.  But that's how I am.  But no, now when I perform, I'm having a good time.  Right.  You know, that's the difference.  Even my father always says, he goes, I don't care how dirty you are as long as you're funny.  He goes, when you go up angry about something, and there were years I went through a lot of shit,  you know, like we all do.  There were years I went up there, and I didn't want to be up there.  But yet, my job is to make people laugh at the end of the day.  No matter what you go through, at the end of the day, make them laugh. 
[00:26:30]  Because if they're paying to see you and to laugh at the shit they're going through,  it's my job to make that happen.  Right.  So, you know, there's just a lot of shit that's gone down.  So, with Kenny, let's get a moment from Kenny.  How are you feeling today, Kenny?  I didn't know this was going to happen until 15 minutes before it happened.  I know.  We didn't feel like telling you.  No, but I even would tell Kenny.  I even told Jameson, we've talked about this, because he's with me a lot.  And I say, you know, he would say, does Kenny know, like, what happened with you guys? 
[00:27:00]  And I would tell him the story and who it was.  And I would say, you know, you can tell him that, because, I mean, you know, things do pass.  You know, you don't stay angry full time, you know.  And, you know, it really bothered me, too, that we weren't talking.  You know, and that's it.  You know, to go any further and tell him what, that was the reason I was angry with him,  because it was a lot of years together.  I think if somebody was talking to my ex-wife, and then I found out one of my friends was talking with her like that, 
[00:27:30]  that would probably piss me off.  Yeah.  And it would seem like a thing.  Do you remember when you told me?  I just know personally.  I don't know the situation, but I think that would piss me off.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I don't want to say anything you might not remember, or maybe you do remember.  Do you remember when you told me that?  No, I don't specifically remember.  We were up at the pool at the hotel, and you said, I said, why isn't she here?  And you said, she wanted you to invite her. 
[00:28:00]  And I looked at you like, why would you not?  And you said, well, I talk to her a lot.  And that, you know, I didn't want to argue with it.  It was a beautiful occasion.  Number one, it was stressful.  So we've got to watch every word we say.  No, not at all.  It might come out ten years later.  You know what?  Ten years.  When it comes to my two boys, I am completely defensive.  I can't argue that point.  I understand.  But, wow, I should have just told someone sooner is all I'm saying.  What do you got on Anthony that's going to come out, like, years from now?  Nothing.  I love the impression.  Okay.  I would even say on the air. 
[00:28:30]  I don't even care what he says, because he does the best.  Because he always has the best impression of me.  It's the reason I ever came up here.  Kenny would call me constantly and go, Anthony was on again doing, you know, Andrew Dice Gay.  It was before I ever came up here.  Andrew Dice Gay.  That was a fun one.  We had you as a janitor back in the day.  You know, whatever it was, you know, and he goes, you got to do something.  You got to go up there.  So he's really the one that brought me up here. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Because I didn't know you guys.  I think you were just on in New York at the time.  Yep.  And I'm going, Kenny, what do I get?  Let him do the impression.  It's good.  Yeah, but he says you're going to be at the Olive Garden.  But he's saying it like he's you.  You know how he talks.  Yeah.  But he's not me.  And the people listening know he's not me.  And then, you know, we got together.  This could hurt you, Andrew.  They're saying bad things about you.  Yeah, he really did.  Do you want me to crack some skulls?  But that's what I'm talking about with loyalty.  That was his loyalty to me calling me and just not liking, even though it's a great impression, 
[00:29:30]  he didn't like how you did.  The whole idea is making fun of the person you're doing.  So out of loyalty, didn't he deserve like an explanation?  Not after that, in my opinion, no.  I'm not going to understand that anytime soon.  Because it was almost like, in my opinion, maybe I'm wrong,  it was like a slip when he told me he's talking to her.  You know, and that is, it's not even like talking to another guy.  It's the wife's closest friend.  And so I'm going, in my mind, I saw both of them talking on the phone. 
[00:30:00]  He's telling her about what I'm feeling.  Oh, God damn.  You know, and that girl even brought problems into the last relationship I had.  You know, bullshitting about, you know, she's just a big fucking mouth.  Just a big fucking mouth.  No, but I don't have to tell her off because I'm not close with her.  Yeah.  You know, I don't have to not be friends with her.  You understand that.  I know you're the guy that gets that. 
[00:30:30]  I do get that part because, uh...  If she cuts both your legs off, you still love her.  Remember that.  I'll remember.  Thank you, Josh.  Just put a little metal cup around your gaga.  Keep that there.  You can still bounce, even if you've got stubs.  Look at Kenny.  I didn't know.  I mean, we are here.  I mean, you know.  I'm glad we have some closure.  No, I never know.  Don and Jim used to tell me that, you know, you would always ask about me and say nice 
[00:31:00]  things about me, but they never told me the reason.  Because you're 6'5".  And they're scared.  And you're not all there.  Yeah.  You might take it the wrong way.  Yeah.  No, I...  You know, even when Kenny went through the...  Are you allowed to talk about it all?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm retired now.  I got my pension.  Okay, good.  When he went through this thing.  Let me tell you...  Through the retirement.  Let me tell you.  Even when he went through that, you know, and I was angry at him. 
[00:31:30]  Defended you.  You know, when I was asked about it by actually a newspaper.  I don't know what newspaper, but on the air, I defended him.  You know, because one thing has nothing to do with the other.  I mean, I've been close with him and his family most of my life, really.  My adult life.  So, I'm not going to rip apart somebody because I'm angry about something else.  Right.  You know what I mean?  So, I defended him with that.  And the only thing I did get angry about is, why didn't you just book every club in the 
[00:32:00]  country that day?  That's all I could think is...  I go, he's all over the news.  Everybody knows the name Ken Fetter today.  Or, I don't know if...  Ken Fetter.  Why didn't he just call Dennis and book every fucking club in the country at a $60 ticket?  Fuck the pension that you make more in two weeks than you make in three lifetimes.  That's all I went crazy. 
[00:32:30]  Like, I wanted to call you and go, what are you waiting for?  You know, because, you know, those things, you know...  Well, let's book it tomorrow.  It was so big.  It'll have the same effect.  It was like Fetter mania.  Fetter mania.  And I'm going, where is he?  You know, I'll put him in front of me.  Let's just book it.  It's like when, uh...  The guy, remember when I...  You wouldn't remember this.  The first, the millionaire guy?  Right.  Yeah.  And I called this guy.  He was a comic.  And it was like one of the first reality shows, like Marry a Millionaire. 
[00:33:00]  And he married that, uh...  The fuck was her name?  The one she wound up, like, showing her slice in...  Dark hunger?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She paraded her little hatchet cut around town for a while.  Here, look at me.  This is me now.  Look at...  Like my smile, fucking bunch of slobs, all of them.  Anyway, what happened is, when that show happened, you know, I knew the guy.  You know?  And I called him, I said, look...  Because I knew he wasn't a phenomenal comic, but he's got ten minutes. 
[00:33:30]  I said, if you want to open for me, my agent said, you'll open for me, we'll book a whole tour.  You gotta do ten minutes.  I'm the one that...  I gotta come out and do an hour.  So he's all into it, and then because the media was all over him, because he was just  a talentless guy, really, you know, he calls me up, he's booked for Larry King, and he  goes, you don't understand, I gotta go on King, like it's his buddy, and clear my name.  And that was the last time I heard of him, or anybody heard of him. 
[00:34:00]  That was it.  You know, but that was a guy that was struggling in comedy for 20 years already.  You know, Kenny is a law enforcement person that got the shot of a lifetime, and I'm going,  book!  Just fucking book the road!  Did you say that to him?  The way you're shaking your head.  No, it makes sense now.  Maybe we should have thought to do.  That's all I can think of going, this is a gold mine.  I think he was worried about his pension at the time, to be honest with you.  I think he was scared out of his fucking wits. 
[00:34:30]  He didn't know what was going to happen to him, and he's got the two kids and stuff,  and he needed to make sure they did the right thing, the police department.  Oh, so you were nervous about that?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I didn't know.  You know, it was a bad scene at the time.  Yeah, but I was thinking, I don't know, you know, what he...  Everyone's phones are going off.  Yeah, but you didn't see mine.  Huh?  What's yours?  Of course you're on the best phone.  That's not about the best.  Is it the ring?  I call it Commando.  Commando. 
[00:35:00]  Wow.  Ooh.  Oh, okay.  The underwater phone.  Underwater phone, so you can call people from underwater.  This is Dylan now.  I'm underwater.  I'm a 13-year-old.  He's growing up.  He's 13.  Awesome.  One of the greatest guitarists you'll ever hear.  I thought he was doing the drum thing.  You see what I mean?  It's another insult.  It's been a long time.  It's been a long time.  Max is the drummer.  Oh, Max was the drummer.  You're right.  Dylan's the guitarist.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's like a prodigy.  He's only 13.  Did their first gig last week at the Canyon Club. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All original.  Were you there?  Yeah, I was there.  All right.  I headlined the show, stupid.  Was I there?  And I had Commando with me, by the way.  The underwater phone.  Yeah.  Just in case.  Yeah, think about it.  You know how everybody tells you what to have?  We live in L.A.  It's very dry out there for the most part.  No, not with the ocean.  Well, you're far from the ocean.  I'm talking about making calls underwater.  No, he already says what they have on their phone.  The ocean's cold.  800 feet under the water. 
[00:36:00]  800 feet.  Yeah.  Let's say you're having a problem with somebody.  Right.  Yeah.  You dive into the ocean.  You call the police.  You know what I mean?  And you're waiting.  They can't catch you because you're underwater, but your phone still works.  Well, why get in a fight with a guy?  You're going to fuck up your clothes.  You're going to fuck everything up.  So you wait.  So you jump in.  You call the police.  He's there alone because you're underwater.  And he's looking for you, and you've got the phone.  You've got the phone.  The cops show up.  Who cares about music? 
[00:36:30]  There's a radio in the car.  I don't care if it downloads music.  It's Commando.  I'm under here now.  You're a mess.  I've got to be honest with you.  The kid, they're phenomenal performers.  L.A. Rock.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  All original.  Mixture of like Guns N' Roses and Led Zeppelin.  Nice.  I've got to pump them because they're doing that thing now.  That's good.  You play guitar?  Nah.  My brother does.  Why are you pumping them?  We don't have an audience, according to you.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:37:00]  We're past our prime.  He won't let it.  Two cents.  You know what?  Everybody's sensitive.  I'm going for little jokes like you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  This was my thing.  Oh, this just didn't.  Dice is just getting mad at his fourth grade teacher right now for a grade that he got.  You know what?  I didn't like my fourth grade teacher.  You know, tomorrow we're going to do a 40-minute bid on this, right?  All the other things you're mad at that are finally coming out.  You know what?  There are certain things that get mad.  The Hindenburg.  Right.  He should have known. 
[00:37:30]  Nothing I heard you say.  You said you didn't say anything.  No, I heard things that would trickle down.  No, I didn't listen.  What do you think?  I want to tune in and go, oh, let me hear them tear me to shreds?  That feels good.  I'll say this.  I was proud of my attack.  You know what?  I'm sure it was very good.  It's what you do, right?  I was proud of my attack.  Okay.  I'm happy that you're proud of it.  I'm sad that the relationship fell apart.  All right.  It happens.  But I'm starting to think I don't think...  It's not like we roll over in the morning and go, good morning, honey. 
[00:38:00]  You guys, you guys, we had a relationship.  We had a verbal disagreement.  That's why I don't have any friends off the air that I met.  I was more saying about Kenny than you.  Of course.  You should be.  You guys, you've been here for a long time.  I'm not trying to, like, you know, make more of it, but I didn't, like...  How come you don't care with how he feels?  Kenny?  Yeah.  I care deeply about how Kenny...  Yeah, he cared.  I hope he's a good friend to me.  He cared. 
[00:38:30]  Dice.  Oh, my God.  We talked about you many times.  Calls him G.H.  And, uh...  What is G.H.?  Gregory Hughes.  Gregory Hughes.  And I felt bad for...  It's okay, G.H.  Yeah.  See, you've missed a lot, man.  It's too bad.  I'm okay with it.  You've missed...  You know what?  I go through a living hell my whole life, so I deal with it.  You missed my growing up years.  Where were you?  Growing up years?  You missed the college years?  Where were you when I was playing Little League and all that?  Look, I was the last four years.  Number one, I was there for you a lot.  I was there for you a lot.  I know you were, but so was I.  How come when I make a point, I... 
[00:39:00]  Because you've talked for the last hour.  We've talked for five minutes.  All right, so go ahead.  That was a joke.  That was a joke.  I'm sorry.  What was so funny about the big joke?  Getting hot in here.  What was so funny about the big joke?  Why can't you film with my camera for a few minutes?  Does that air on something?  Yeah.  No, it's empty.  No, I don't...  No.  What I'm saying, do you use it like YouTube or shit like that?  Yeah, we might throw it.  Can you do mine a few minutes?  Just for...  So I...  You know, I just like getting it.  Like, for prost...  It's just for fun.  Remember how...  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  Uh, no, Dice, listen to me, please.  Kenny...  I'm really a Sony guy.  Yeah.  This was on the spur of the moment.  Are you...  I believe in Sony.  When are you going to tell...  When are you going to tell Canon that you're mad at them?  I didn't even say their name.  You know what?  But, you know, it's just an opinion.  Canon, to me, is not Sony.  Well, that's a good opinion.  Sony fucks you in the ass with the prices.  Right.  You know, but it's a good product.  Kenny was...  I like the Canon.  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have any...  Kenny, I'm trying.  Yeah, I'm putting it on.  Kenny, I'm trying. 
[00:40:00]  That should be an endorsement.  Just make sure you get everybody...  Dice.  Kenny was...  Get my eyes.  They're blue.  Kenny was deeply bummed out by how it went bad.  Why didn't you call me?  Why I got to call everybody?  That's a good point.  Yeah, see, that's it.  Everything I've heard is like, Dice, why didn't you get on the phone and call?  It's like, why is it Dice's responsibility to call?  He's mad.  Like, if somebody picks up that Dice is mad by, you know, secondhand hearing it, or they  figure...  Maybe then call Dice.  I'll tell you why I didn't...  I called you after I realized, wow, he is fucking not happy with me. 
[00:40:30]  I'm just playing the Dice's advocate here.  Because I don't remember...  It might have been the Howard show, I don't know, when we realized, wow, this guy...  This guy fucking hates us.  What's this about?  And I did reach out to you.  I did not leave a message.  And you just got to believe me on that.  I do believe you.  I wasn't going to leave a message...  See, I don't think you're a liar.  If I tell you something, I'm not lying.  And if you tell me something...  I was like, if he picks up the phone good, we'll try to see what happens here.  And that's the best I did.  And I only tried...  I tried two phones.  What is this, Raging Bull, where Lamada calls his brother and doesn't talk? 
[00:41:00]  Remember that?  I never understood that.  No, because the brother's like, hello, hello?  And he's just sitting there with the phone.  Yeah.  But he's nuts, and he had a lifelong thing about getting him down.  But Kenny...  Trying to prove two things.  Two things, Dan.  I'm nuts.  He ain't got a lifelong thing about getting me down.  And Kenny's more of a woman than all of us, and he was...  You caught those carrots.  He was deeply bummed out.  You caught those carrots.  All right, Kenny.  You're on your own.  I can't.  Bring it over here.  Bring it over here. 
[00:41:30]  You want your steak?  Bring it over here.  You missed my prime and everything.  I love that.  Where have you been?  Isn't that the greatest scene?  I love that scene.  Can we talk about something fun for a minute, and then...  Yeah, I just want to...  I'll sit here.  You could just yell at me.  I'm just kidding.  I was sleeping until ten minutes before I had to come up here.  I haven't yelled.  I'm not saying yell.  I mean it like as a euphemism.  It took fun, little, cute, little jab.  What does euphemism mean?  I don't know.  It's good, though.  It sounds like something else, but yeah.  It's a young-mism.  So I actually said it right? 
[00:42:00]  I actually said it right?  Boo.  What about the big sandwiches at the Carnegie Deli?  I'm remembering more stuff now.  What about the big sandwiches?  Him with the memories.  I loved having it with you.  See, I'm just trying to make...  You know, and the black cherry soda.  You think I forgot that?  Black cherry soda, nice.  I'm allergic to cherries.  Thanks for allowing me.  One of my favorite dice experiences was going, walking down 57 and...  Buying the big Everlast sweatshirts that we said, maybe I should take like a medium.  And he's like, no, extra large for everybody. 
[00:42:30]  And we all walked around with giant sweatshirts on.  Do you call that giant?  Today you could get 8X, 9X, 10X.  Yeah.  You know how phenomenal that is?  They were giant.  Yeah, that's what I like.  Yeah.  Giant clothes.  And then he was haggling like we were in Bangladesh.  He's haggling for the price of the guy.  No, but you know the best is when you get close to the person.  Yeah.  And maybe...  Now I actually put my arm around them.  Oh, no.  They must love that.  And I go, listen to me.  And I say it like, we're talking about cash. 
[00:43:00]  It's a little secret.  Like I'm the only one that has some on me.  That's paying cash.  Yeah.  I'm going to pay you in cash.  Okay.  Okay.  So what are you going to do here?  And you look around like there's 100 people watching.  I did it with Commando.  Ah, the underwater phone.  Yeah.  I walked...  You know what's so funny about going in?  Just wait for the underwater phone dice bits.  You know what's so nuts about you?  You want to know what assholes people really are?  You ever go buy a phone? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So I went in because I knew it was late at night, like right before they closed.  Right?  And there's like 10 salespeople standing around doing nothing.  This is what fucking robots these assholes are.  And I come over to a guy.  I go, yeah, I'm looking for a phone, whatever, you know?  And the guy goes, all right, you just got to check in.  You know, like where you got...  Yeah, you know where you got to like put your name in like a computer, which I don't  know how to do.  Okay?  And I'm going, I am checking in with you.  I go, there's nobody here, but they're so robotic. 
[00:44:00]  I nearly didn't own Commando, of course it is.  That would have been tragic.  Because I'm actually looking at the guy going, you're fucking kidding me, right?  I go, there's nine people standing there.  You're going to close in 15 minutes.  Check what?  Check what?  Go get me a phone.  Go in the back and get me a phone.  That's what it became because I was so angry.  It's infuriating.  And right there and then I let him know how I felt.  But I was good.  Yeah, no, you got to get your feelings out. 
[00:44:30]  That's what you're saying.  I think you're learning that, right?  Yeah.  Where's Jimmy on this whole thing?  I think that what happened was, is that a bunch of people who genuinely liked each other  hurt each other's feelings.  Everybody got their feelings hurt.  And no one is good at saying my feelings are hurt.  A bunch of women.  But that's what it is.  No one's good at saying, you know what, that hurts.  Men, we don't react that way.  We get fucking angry.  Fuck you.  It's very hard to go, fuck, man.  That kind of hurt when you say that.  Stung a little bit.  It's very difficult to do that.  See, even the thing with Kennedy, like, I was hurt. 
[00:45:00]  I was hurt.  Now it's all about being hurt.  That he didn't call me.  I'm going to friends with the guy, you know, my whole life.  Why isn't he calling me?  Right, right.  Why do I got to call all the time?  Well, in my case, I didn't know you were mad at me.  Or I would have called you right away.  All right, so a couple years later, when I got angry, why didn't you call me?  I can't believe you.  No, because how am I going to be mad at you for hanging out in the gym and pumping iron?  What, am I going to get mad then and ruin the workout?  We're in the cage at that moment. 
[00:45:30]  What about the special hike?  The hike was nice.  You've done the hike, Kenny.  The mountain.  The mountain.  Well, it's a little hill.  You had a tough time going up that mountain, trust me.  No, we had to stop.  I don't like the mountain.  You don't like the mountain?  Yeah, he does.  He never liked the mountain.  He did it, but he didn't like it.  He has special rules.  You've got to stop at certain points and take a look at the view.  You've got to spit the water out.  Spit the water and the whole thing.  You get in the cage.  It's exhausting.  I forgot how exhausting Dice is to hang out with. 
[00:46:00]  You're exhausting.  But you did the mountain, didn't you?  Yeah, we sat.  And you were happy once you got there.  I think there was like a bench up there, and we were overlooking L.A., and we were having moments.  That would have been this.  You should have done the max thing there.  That wasn't the time.  I'm thinking you should have done it there.  How can I start screaming?  I'm exhausted.  What do you mean that's not the time?  Sweating.  What do you want?  You're waiting for us to climb Mount Everest together?  No, I'm saying we were having a great time.  There'd be no reason to get angry.  So you just kept having good times until I got angry.  It was years later. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  And then he got angry.  He buries things.  A lot of times we bury things like, it's in there, it's in there.  And then one day a cap just comes off, and pfft, and it comes out.  It's really, it's really.  Yeah, and I remember we filmed that scene at the comedy store.  I was a bad actor.  Yeah, now you come up with some of the moments now.  Yeah, no, we were filming that.  We were having fun.  Yeah.  I was hoping to see that somewhere.  About Dylan saving his school.  Sure.  Right?  You have it on a loop.  That he swung through.  He has it on a loop somewhere.  He watches it a lot.  No, that he swung through the window of the school. 
[00:47:00]  He was like a.  About these terrorists.  Oh.  He was like a superhero.  Yeah, he was a superhero.  Type of guy.  See, we talked about your kids a lot.  I know.  And then you made him feel bad, one of them.  But I didn't know.  And you didn't tell me.  What?  Now you know.  And now all this.  Now what?  Well, how great is this then?  If I didn't do what I did, this could have never happened.  What about.  This is a great moment.  This moment would never be.  You never helped me with my window treatments, remember? 
[00:47:30]  You were walking around my place going, oh, window treatments.  Good thing, too.  I took you clothing shopping.  I didn't even know what window treatments were.  But a good thing he didn't, because you left that place.  Oh, yeah.  Long gone.  And you would have those window treatments would have stayed.  I mean, now you're back to wearing brown.  You were wearing black when you hung out with me.  Yeah.  Now you're going to Earth Tone.  I had to.  See?  Earth Tone.  I had to get us that.  Greens, browns.  I had to get in touch with.  Just go black.  Why brown, green, black.  Black.  Like your hat.  Basic black.  Basic black. 
[00:48:00]  It works.  How about beige?  There's no sinking.  Beige sickens me.  No.  It sickened me when I was 10, walking around with piss stains in school.  Piss stains.  You go to the bathroom, you come back, it looks like you fucking came in your pants.  And everybody's looking, and you're about, fuck beige.  And anybody that wears it.  So, this is really weird.  Like, Kenny hasn't seen Dice in four years.  I know.  But it doesn't feel like that now that I'm seeing them.  That's what I'm saying. 
[00:48:30]  It doesn't feel like that.  He's just as handsome.  Maybe to you.  How do you feel, Kenny?  He is just as handsome.  Those chiseled cheekbones.  The blue aisles that sparkle like the Nile.  Oh, see?  Kenny, you're the worst.  A little more far ahead.  Mike Cole's checking in.  Huh?  Mike Cole's checking in saying that he thinks Opie might be worried now that Kenny's going  to leave.  Oh, I would still lose that one.  Who's Mike Cole?  He's a cop friend of ours.  He's one of my new friends. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, okay.  And that tells me when he's mad at me.  He might be.  And we work it out over beer like that.  And then we move back to the fun times.  I don't drink.  Is GH getting worried?  Kenny's going to leave.  Go back to Andrew.  Yeah.  Mmm.  Kenny holds a grudge like a mosquito.  He's right back in his camp.  I go to the highest bidder.  Like nothing.  Like nothing.  Like it's bitter.  It took 30 seconds to understand in here.  He had me from hello. 
[00:49:30]  He likes the, Kenny likes the drama.  Oh, Kenny loves drama.  He loves it.  Oh, he loves talking about it.  Andrew, these guys think I'm very pessimistic.  Yeah.  Like always giving them bad news.  Like remember like when he used to first wake up.  Dad, I forgot.  See, this was Kenny, right?  I could wake up.  My fucking throat.  All right.  I'm good.  I could wake up in the morning, right?  In a great mood.  We'd be like in Vegas.  Like, you know, Venetian headline. 
[00:50:00]  Great.  You know, here comes Kenny.  And I see the face.  He's got a face on.  And I'm going, everything all right?  Well, you just woke up.  I don't want to.  I go, yeah, but you got this face.  Son, you know.  No, it's a, I'll just handle it.  So I'm not, my eyes aren't even open, you know.  So now you got to go, what, Kenny?  You know, so I'm going, Kenny, just fucking tell me. 
[00:50:30]  What is it?  Well, Marty called for three more tickets.  I'm going, yeah.  He got me the gig.  He got me fucking headlining at the Venetian.  Give him the ticket.  He said, well, you know, what if he's selling them?  Who the fuck cares?  Let him sell them.  I hope he's selling them.  Oh, he's the worst.  And it was always stuff like that.  It was never real heavy stuff. 
[00:51:00]  But he'd make me so fucking nervous that I'm going, just fucking tell me.  Screaming.  But that's another thing you missed, us getting to know Kenny.  See, now we know that.  We know those little things.  But I didn't have to be there for you to get to know him for your moments that might have  turned into something really special.  You weren't there for our Leno appearance.  I wasn't there for that.  I didn't know you did it.  I know.  It would have been nice.  Letterman.  Letterman.  Leno? 
[00:51:30]  And Letterman.  I couldn't care less.  That's your career.  Well, as a friend, it would have been nice to know you were there.  You can't have been making a living with the bullshit.  And I go, you don't care.  What do you give a fuck?  Well, you know.  I consoled you when the thing happened when you were banned from the other radio.  Oh, for the Sex with Sam.  Yeah, we had a long talk about it.  Yeah, we talked about it a lot.  You gave me.  You were really fucked up from there.  You gave me great advice.  Why didn't you talk about that?  I said, you gave me great advice when we climbed that little tiny little hill that 
[00:52:00]  Kenny likes to call them out.  You want to tell people stuff.  You want to tell them about awful stuff.  Tell people how I treated you.  I told them about the stir fry and the shopping and the gross gym.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Tell them the real shit.  And then you tell me about how the comedy store is haunted and we were there in the  back room scared.  No, that's not what I'm talking about.  And you know it, see?  How about when they butterflied his steak?  The time you sent your steak back three times. 
[00:52:30]  Do you remember when I told you?  We're talking about all bullshit stuff.  And what he felt with me.  All right.  All right.  But when you guys weren't on the air, he was very.  Oh, yeah.  We were all fucked up.  Yeah, but I didn't see you.  No, no.  You just stayed at home.  I hibernated.  We had many hours on the phone and then especially on top of the hill.  And you said they pretty much ruined you back in the day.  And you told me to be extremely careful.  No, but I'm told once you were off the air, I can solve you with that stuff.  Because you said, I know exactly where you're at because I was on top of the world. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, because who went through more than me with that shit?  And you said, I went through this and you got to be really careful because they're out  to get you now.  Well, there's always the boss.  Right.  You know, the boss of the company always wins.  That's it.  I actually learned that lesson from you.  Yeah.  And I would talk to you a lot.  You would be calling me with that stuff and I go, look, no matter what they pay you and  who you think you are, they're still the ones paying you.  And honestly, I did learn that from you because before that happened, I thought Ant and I, 
[00:53:30]  we were like, we were hot shit.  We were syndicated all over the country.  We had massive ratings.  They were, the money was flowing.  I'm like, we fucking run this place.  They don't run this place.  I learned that lesson from you.  All right.  Well, you finally said something.  I've said some nice things.  No, sir.  I'm not talking about shopping.  What about the huge?  You know what I mean?  This is a serious conference.  I mean, it's fun, but you got to say it the way.  It is.  I did.  You know, don't make me to be the bad guy.  Wow. 
[00:54:00]  Right in there.  Yeah.  You're not the bad guy.  Yeah, exactly.  And now we're all, we're all, I think we were all.  Anthony doesn't like real moments.  I think we're all good.  He doesn't, right?  It's uncomfortable.  But he's talked to me with some heavy stuff.  Yeah.  At that time.  And Dice again gave good advice.  Which he didn't listen to himself, but he gave good advice.  But that's how it is with anybody.  If somebody comes to you with a relationship, you know, you got the greatest advice.  The minute your chick comes down on you, the fuck did I do? 
[00:54:30]  How do I get it back?  Yeah, what happened?  What the fuck?  Dude, how bad do you want to do the bit tomorrow?  I want to do Dice Underwater Phone.  And Dice Underwater Phone.  And Dice mad at people for shit that happened 50 years ago.  Yeah, Dice.  The Nazis!  But Dice, you hung out with Hitler for many, many years.  Yeah, but I wasn't mad.  I wasn't ready to be mad.  But Dice, you were his pal.  But where was he going to get mad? 
[00:55:00]  In the bunker?  Right.  The time wasn't right.  What do you mean the time wasn't right?  He took out a million.  Why are you doing the bit that you're going to do tomorrow night?  Oh, yeah.  We're just practicing.  Now tomorrow we do it.  You're practicing to do it tomorrow.  And then underwater phone service.  You hear me now?  Let me tell you something.  You can't even get this.  No?  No.  What do you think?  You could walk into a phone store and go give me the underwater phone.  They're giving it to you.  Give me the Dice phone.  You ain't getting this.  Call the Dice phone.  If you want it, you can tell me.  But it has an antenna.  And I know who to call to get it for you. 
[00:55:30]  It's got the window on the front.  It's got an antenna, though.  They should give this away with every hummer sold.  And I'm not talking about the one on your prick.  Of course.  You know what I mean?  Look at this.  This is a real phone.  It's all right.  Yeah, look.  Watch what I do.  I drop it.  Oh!  Nothing happens.  Why?  Look at this.  Industrial.  To go underwater.  Can I drop it?  800 feet.  Can I drop it?  Nobody touches this.  Can I drop it?  It's commando.  Let me go commando with it.  Hello.  Let's see what I can do.  I'll take your picture. 
[00:56:00]  No, no, no.  800 feet.  800 feet.  It doesn't make a call at 800 feet.  Why wouldn't you just swim up to air first?  I'm drowning.  Oh, good picture of...  Oh, that's E-Rock Dice.  Look at that.  Dice.  That's a good Jimmy picture.  That's right.  Can I say it?  Hey, Dice.  Look what I do.  Save.  Dice.  I don't want to deliver until I delete it.  Let me see a picture.  Well, now...  What, E-Rock?  Dice.  I don't know how to get to my...  Oh, here it is.  Dice, you missed all the new hires that we did and everything. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  You don't...  Dice.  Dice.  I'm showing him the picture.  You don't know E-Rock.  You don't know Sam.  You don't know any of these guys.  Who's the big audience out there?  Why are you just...  It's four people.  I get it.  We didn't invite people.  They come by on their own.  They just show up.  Or you're just making the...  Yeah, I was making a little joke like you do.  Oh.  Oh, it's not fun when...  How come...  How come...  It's not fun when it's directed at you.  Yeah, but I didn't say how many people.  It's not fun when it's directed at you.  No, but it's a goof.  I think it's a cool thing to have some people. 
[00:57:00]  No, actually, on Fridays...  Can you hear us out there?  That would be funnier if they didn't.  That they just sit and watch.  That they just have to watch without hearing anything.  Shut them down.  Are you going to go on Howard now and say,  I was there and they had three fans in the stands?  Because that'll hurt us.  I don't have to.  You just said it.  That'll make us...  That'll make us sad.  And that's Stan.  You don't know him.  You don't know any of these guys.  How's it going?  How are you?  He's a fucking barrel of laughs.  Barrel of laughs.  He's a comic.  An aspiring comic. 
[00:57:30]  Okay, cool.  He's leaving the show.  Get him a little.  If he becomes a big star, I got to be on film.  I love this.  There.  You got him.  So, do you know him, Norton?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We've worked together.  Anything?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's funny.  It's very dry.  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  And you're...  No, not Anthony Dice Clay.  Andrew Dice...  And you're listening to Hopi  and the guy that wants to be me show.  Hopi and Anthony.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[00:58:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, put them together for Spuds Kinder! 
[00:58:30]  I hate you two.  A Spuds Buckley remix.  Yeah.  I hate that Spuds Buckley.  That's why I make it for him.  Nice.  Thanks.  Spuds back.  Yeah, that's going to happen.  Spuds ruled.  Wow.  That's good, Drew.  Kind of like Boston, though, we did want to recast the Spuds Buckley character on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, what happened?  Because the original Spuds Buckley died tragically in 19, I think it was like 98, somewhere around there.  Barbecue in the bedroom.  Yeah, and he was a big part of the Opie and Anthony show.  We need to recast the Spuds Buckley character.  Do we?  I think some of the guys were going to give it a try around here, and then we dropped the Bith.  Yeah.  And we should have dropped the Bith.  877-212-ON-A.  By the way, I got a Travis who wrote the sheet.  His name is not Tank Cankerus, you dumbbell. 
[00:59:30]  It's Tank Hankerus.  Tank Hankerus.  With an H.  Tank Hankerus.  Tank Hankerus is a Greek.  What do you got?  We have a new shirt for Tank.  Yeah, Tank.  Why don't you put your shirt on for everybody?  What are you doing, Tank?  You don't have a tank top on.  Yeah, exactly.  What does the shirt say, Tank?  I can't read it.  That's E-Rock.  I want to talk to Tank.  The shirt says, here comes the S-show. 
[01:00:00]  That's great.  So fitting.  Yeah.  As he puts on his tank top, instant feedback.  Sonny Farrelly from Boston writes, he's really good.  Don't knock this guy till you listen to him, and then you can make your decision.  Of course, the new lead singer of Boston, now that Brad Delp has passed on, is Tommy DiCarlo,  who used to work at a Home Depot.  And then they got another guy in there, though.  So how do you get two people to replace Brad Delp?  Well, you got to harmonize.  Yeah, true.  I think when Boston went on tour, Brad Delp actually sang over his own voice. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, I think they tracked it.  Because they did a little of that overdubbing.  And then you got John Fox from Brooklyn.  He writes, there are four karaoke bands out on tour right now this summer.  You got Boston without Brad Delp.  You got Styx without Dennis DeYoung.  You got Foreigner without Lou Graham.  And you got Journey without Steve Perry.  Yeah.  And people are going to these shows.  Like it's the real band.  These shows are doing really well without the lead singers.  That made them famous.  People love nostalgia.  Styx, at least Tommy Shaw sang. 
[01:01:00]  Is he still in the band?  Yeah, of course he is.  Because he sang some of the stuff, too.  He was a great guitarist.  He's there until the damn Yankees get together.  Yeah.  And then he goes, screw Styx.  Here's a little taste of Tommy DiCarlo as the new lead singer of Boston.  And you know what? 
[01:01:30]  Sounds pretty good.  Hey, the guy sounds pretty good.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  You think he's on the new shirts?  Like they just have a Boston logo with a guy on a forklift backing up. 
[01:02:00]  Getting lumber for somebody.  Holding a propane tank on the shirt.  Where are the ceiling fans, Fatty?  What's that?  That's one of his professional photos.  Oh, it looks good.  Oh, God.  Yuck.  There's a photo of him.  And he's got like a little keyboard.  It looks like it's floating next to him.  And his right hand is in tink-a-link-a-link position.  Tink-a-link-a-link.  Yeah, it looks like a glamour shot.  That is awful.  Well, but, you know, got to give it to him.  I'm getting some more info from Stump Brain.  Journey's lead singer is a Filipino guy. 
[01:02:30]  Really?  Yeah, named Arnell Panetta?  Something like that?  I heard he sounds just like Steve Perry.  I want to hear some of him.  But you know what?  I want to see Steve Perry.  Yeah.  Why isn't Steve Perry going out with him?  Or why isn't Dennis DeYoung with...  They just hate their old bandmates?  After a while, you just can't stand the people you work with.  But what else are you doing, though?  Let's say hi to Mike.  What else is he doing?  Mike?  I don't know.  Where's Dennis DeYoung?  I think Dennis DeYoung, like, was allergic to light or something.  I saw one of those dumb freaking VH1 shows. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, was he really?  And he had a problem with light.  And he was doing Broadway shows.  He was doing, like, the music of Broadway as a one-man show in little cabaret theaters.  Oh, but look it up.  Gay?  Look it up, though.  I think he has some kind of allergic reaction to light, and it prevented him from traveling.  I don't know.  Well, didn't he want to do...  He's a freak.  He's a weirdo.  He wanted to do, like, the stage act where he had to...  He wanted to do, like, the stage play of Mr. Roboto. 
[01:03:30]  Well, that's genius.  He acted all out, and you guys were like, this stinks.  Mm-hmm.  Let's say hi to Mike, who works at WBCN in Boston.  He wants in on this conversation.  What's up, Mike?  Not much.  How's it going?  Good, bro.  Yeah, Tom Schultz, he was pretty much the mastermind behind Boston.  Yep.  He was the one that came up with that whole falsetto chorus stuff.  Okay.  Oh, yeah?  He felt it, yeah.  And so, I guess, during the years, though, after, like, creative differences and stuff,  and they eventually fell apart, and after Adele died, his wife actually blamed Schultz for 
[01:04:00]  some of his depression for causing all that crap.  Why?  I have no idea, but I guess they just had a big falling out, and Tom was giving them crap  and just led to one thing to another.  Yeah, they didn't talk to each other at the end of Brad Delp's life.  Nope, that was pretty much it.  Yeah.  And now you've got a Home Depot guy, and he's sounding pretty good.  Yeah, I haven't heard him yet, so I have no idea.  Yeah, we just gave him a little listen.  Kind of sounds like him.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Thanks for the info.  Let's say hi to Will, the trucker. 
[01:04:30]  Will.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I was just wanting to find out who replaced Tony DiCarlo at the Home Depot.  Well, now that's the big question.  How to replace him.  There's just some dude at Home Depot.  You know what?  I replaced Tommy DiCarlo.  That's right.  Who's Tommy DiCarlo?  Well, he's the lead singer of Boston.  And I filled his position here at the Home Depot.  And I'm stacking sheetrock.  Yeah.  How big are the gigs they're doing? 
[01:05:00]  5,000 seats?  I was mistaken.  I said Jones Beach.  They're playing PNC.  You know, we just played PNC.  And I'm sure they'll get, you know, 10, 12, 14,000 people there.  Easy.  Sure.  They'll package them together.  They'll do 15,000.  Do a couple of bands together?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I appreciate it, brother.  All right.  And I'm getting more info on Lou Graham.  Lou Graham played a lobster festival up there in Maine.  Ooh.  So his old bandmates are touring as Foreigner.  And Lou Graham is playing Lobster Fest.  Oh, God. 
[01:05:30]  What the hell happened to our youth?  Why is he just go out with a band?  What, do they rape each other on the road?  How bad can it be?  They do have some hatred, some of these guys.  But they could never, ever play with each other again.  The guy falls asleep in his buation and his bandmates on his chest.  He's got it out.  How bad should it be on the road?  I don't know.  You're doing a Lobster Fest in Maine.  Let's say hi to Eric in Indiana.  Eric.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah, I heard Allison Change is doing that cover band thing.  And you can't replace Lane Staley. 
[01:06:00]  I hear they sound really good, too.  But Lane Staley was just a special performer.  Isn't the singer a black guy, too?  He's a black guy that sounds a lot like Lane.  But that's another band that could pull it off because you could harmonize.  So you don't really need the guy to sound exactly like Lane because you could cover up a lot of stuff with some harmonization.  That's hard, though.  Lane had a very distinct voice.  We were talking to someone recently, and they said the new Alice in Chains stuff is really, really good.  There's a song on there that's going to blow everyone away.  I forgot who was telling us that.  I want to know who replaced Stephen Carr in Foundry. 
[01:06:30]  Who'd they get there?  Here we go.  Yeah.  I think Corky, after he left Life or God, sang a little bit.  What big queen replaced him?  Charles Nelson, Paul Lane. 
[01:07:00]  Get out of my way.  Oh.  Ah, let's say hi to somebody in Jersey.  Somebody in Jersey, how are you today?  All right, good, guys.  How are you doing?  They didn't have your name on the screen.  I don't know who you are.  I saw Alton Chains last year at the Borgata.  And the guy, not only is he a black guy, he's this tall, skinny black guy with a huge apple.  Looks like Shaft.  Doesn't look the part at all, but he was great.  But he was great, huh? 
[01:07:30]  I just have a problem seeing these bands after the lead singer either dies or moves on.  Except for ACDC with this Brian Johnson.  He filled the shoes quite well and had a lot of huge hits after when he became the singer.  Well, Bon Scott died, but he didn't just do a bunch of Bon Scott covers.  He did new material.  Right.  He replaced a lead singer, and it's a whole new era of the band that's different.  These guys are just going out like...  Plus, ACDC was a lot younger then.  It was almost like the...  Well, they were more successful with Brian Johnson.  Yeah, they were able to play some right new songs, so it was, you know... 
[01:08:00]  And have huge hits.  When you're just going out like after the band has seen 20 years, and then the guy is singing...  They have established songs, and that's the only thing people want to hear.  To do an impression of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see.  It is an impression.  They're not throwing their own twist on it.  They're trying to sound exactly like the singer did.  Because that's what the audience wants.  It's Chappie, Boston, listening on BCN.  How are you?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey there, Chappie.  Hey, T and I were talking about the Filipino singer from Journey.  And apparently, the guy doesn't speak English. 
[01:08:30]  He just gets out there and sings.  Somebody else does the announcement.  Hey, this is the song I'm going to sing, and the guy just starts developing the shit out.  I thought I was sorry about that.  That's okay.  That's pretty funny.  No English, huh?  Is that true?  It's not true.  It's not true?  No.  It's not true.  I like to think it's true.  It's not true.  The new lead singer of Journey is Filipino, and he doesn't speak English, but he knows  how to sing in English.  He's got a really thick Filipino accent, but when he sings, he sounds identical to Steve  Perry.  They're pulling an audio. 
[01:09:00]  Steve, who replaced you in Foundry?  Steve who?  Other morbidly obese homosexual who shops for clothing at Lane Bryant.  Thank you very much.  Lane Bryant.  You did shop at Lane Bryant.  Yeah.  I do.  All right.  Let's go to Bryant in Jersey.  Wait, were you the original singer, or did you replace someone?  No, it was me.  I was the original one.  You know what?  I replaced Harvey Fierstein.  Get out of my way. 
[01:09:30]  Duff McKagan told us that the new Alice in Chains song is really, really good.  Thank you for that blowing fouls from Cleveland.  E-Rock is working on a Foundry remix.  It's not done yet, but he wants to play a little sample for us to prove that every song  from Foundry sounded exactly the same.  Oh, did it?  I think they're all the same tempo.  All right.  Here we go.  E-Rock's got a little montage.  A little montage?  Foundry song.  Okay.  All that's left will be scattered.  Drive to hide.  The pain I feel is not in our field. 
[01:10:00]  It's real.  And cannot be concealed.  So you will hear.  A tear and I just run what you will hear.  Then you might just see what you'll see.  My heart can't care.  They're not out of the room.  You change for years.  Of a new song.  Yeah.  That's the hit.  This is a new song, too.  That's not.  That's the same song, dude.  Is it? 
[01:10:30]  Hold on.  E-Rock's arguing.  E-Rock.  That's the guitar solo from Pendulum, and there's another guitar solo.  I forgot to write down the third song, but it's mixed together.  Oh, wow.  It's all exactly the same.  Oh, is that all you have so far?  Both guitar solos?  All right, wait.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Wait, this needs a setup, because it's so damn good.  But how are we going to cue the people?  Hit the bell when it's a new song.  Okay.  Because this whole thing sounds like one song, but E-Rock put three songs together.  Three songs together.  For Foundry.  Start over.  Okay, here's the first song.  When you hear the bell, that'll be the second song kicking in. 
[01:11:00]  Scattered.  Drive.  Too high.  The pain I feel is tired.  And now I feel.  It's real.  And cannot be concealed.  So you will hear.  A tear and I just run what you will hear.  Then you might just see what you'll see.  You'll see my fucking hair, man.  That's what I'm getting home.  Change me into something that I just can't control.  You see the girl in the street out of my way.  Well, pendulum is swinging back the other way.  I love pendulum. 
[01:11:30]  I love that song, pendulum.  Wow, that's a super mix.  Almost every song starts and ends the same with the...  And then a long guitar, right at the end.  Fantastic.  If we didn't tell the people, you would think that's one song.  That was three songs.  One long act of auditory rape.  Dude, let E-Rock mix your songs.  You might have a hit.  If you put the whole album together, you got one good song. 
[01:12:00]  Get the band back together.  Here's the...  Go to a Lowe's, maybe, and get a singer that can replace you.  Okay.  Here's...  True Value Hardware.  Yes, I'm going to Ace to look for a place.  Ace is the place to get a lead singer.  We're doing a song called Tough Actin' Ten Actin'.  Hey, athlete sports, get out of my way. 
[01:12:30]  You guys want to hear that?  I like pendulum.  It's a good song.  We're going to go backwards now.  You want to hear the Filipino sound like Steve Perry?  Oh, please.  All right, here we go.  This is not Steve Perry.  It's just a small town girl  Living in a lonely world  It's with the midnight train of any day  Holy jeez. 
[01:13:00]  Unbelievable.  It's just a city boy  Former is a proud Detroit  It's with the midnight train of any day  That's ridiculous.  Good out of my way.  No?  They also re-recorded all of their greatest hits and put it out as a double CD.  So the first CD is a greatest hits album with the Filipino guys.  With the new singer.  So, wow. 
[01:13:30]  That's some good marketing.  Whoa, that's ballsy.  And then a second disc of all originals with him singing as well.  I don't know how that works, you know, if there's an advantage to that.  He re-did certain songs?  Re-did all the greatest hits.  All the hits.  It's a great best.  At least Steve Perry doesn't get anything.  Steve Perry, I guess, doesn't get performance royalties on the new CD.  Oh, wow.  I'm assuming that's what, I mean, unless he gets writer's real.  Oh, my God.  Steve Perry was another one they had on that VH1 stuff, and he looked like he was way full of himself.  Yeah, they don't get along at all. 
[01:14:00]  Did you find out about Dennis the Young and this light thing?  I haven't found it yet.  Steve, it's time for getting back together.  Yes.  I would love it.  That's the question.  No money.  You know how much people would want to hear you sing Pendulum?  Not at all.  Oh, my God.  Now?  The song's now a hit.  There's a resurgence.  Did he do Pendulum Unplugged?  Just doing a guitar.  Get some guys in there, a guitar.  Put a big cowboy hat on you.  You could.  Would it sound awful?  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Unplugged.  How about acapella?  No. 
[01:14:30]  No.  As in, why not?  I mean, we're here.  We got microphones.  Don't, Brian, yes.  You are correct, sir.  He did get a viral infection that made him sensitive to light, and he has been cured of  it now, but it was a serious viral infection.  I'd like to think that he's been living in the dark for the last 10 years.  That is a horrible thing.  He has two pets to both.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey, marble mouth.  What?  I'm hungry. 
[01:15:00]  Jimmy's hungry.  For surgery, they should insert a funny bone.  Tee hee.  So why can't we get an acapella version of Foundry?  I mean, of Pendula.  I think the guys would love it.  I know I would.  Yeah, you work on that while we're on vacation.  Okay, I will.  I mean, today.  Today.  I don't honestly remember all the lyrics.  All right.  You got until we get...  I could do the chorus, and that's about it.  You got...  The day we get back from vacation, you're doing that on the show.  So you got a week to practice.  You got it.  Let's say hi to Kristen in Union.  Kristen. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good.  Good.  Love you guys.  Listen, my husband and I went and saw Journey about three years ago.  Actually, I went to go to the opening band when Fuel was really big, even though they  sucked.  But my husband went to Journey, and they were amazing.  They put on an incredible show.  I couldn't tell if it was Steve Perry or the other guys.  They were really, really good.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  I think that guy just turned me around a little bit.  I don't really like seeing these bands without the lead singer.  That guy...  Oh, wow. 
[01:16:00]  He could hit it.  I thought our Anthony's old pal, Hugo, could do the Journey thing.  Hugo, yeah.  But that guy, wow.  Hugo looks just like him, too.  Yeah.  Thank you, Kristen.  Well, you guys are great, and I love you.  Oh, thanks.  Dan, North Carolina.  Hey, Dan.  Hello.  Hey, you're on the air.  Yeah, I saw him in Charlotte on Saturday night, man.  That guy is dead on.  They're not missing Steve Perry.  Steve Perry must be at home just freaking kicking walls all day long. 
[01:16:30]  Does he look like him at all, or...?  Yeah, he's got the long hair, long, dark hair like Steve Perry had.  Okay.  I mean, he's a short little dude, but, man, he can put it out.  There's a surprise.  A Filipino that's short.  Steve Perry was last seen at the store buying charcoal and lighter fluid.  Let's go to Bruce, Louisiana. 
[01:17:00]  Brucey.  Yeah, hey, yeah.  Doesn't Brother Joe do a thing with the Aerosmith songs where he runs them all together and you  can't tell where they change?  Yeah, I'm not sure.  I don't remember that.  I thought they talked about it.  I'm not my brother's keeper.  I wanted more improv out of Steve.  Yes.  Yes.  So great.  It's fantastic.  Totally devoid of any improvisational skills.  Who's replacing you in the foundry? 
[01:17:30]  Another morbidly obese replacing man.  Apparently, Wikipedia has Steve Perry's biopicture, a picture of him cooking over a barbecue.  Interesting.  Foreshadowing?  Ask Sam.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Drew Boogie.  Drew?  Drew Boogie will play us into break.  Oh, he's in the hizzy.  That's right. 
[01:18:00]  Booyah!  Booyah!  Booyah!  Booyah! 
[01:18:30]  Opie and Dopey.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, here's Al Gore.  America needs change more than ever.  After eight years of incompetence, neglect, and failure, we need change.  After eight years in which our Constitution has been dishonored and disrespected, we need change.  After eight years of the worst, most serious foreign policy mistakes in the entire history of our nation, we need change. 
[01:19:00]  And he gave this speech after Clinton left office, which I thought was appropriate.  Oh, swimwalk, baby.  Oh, kid.  Back from Bonnaroo.  Bonnaroo.  I argued that the occupation of Iraq would be dangerous and harmful for our country.  And I will remember how few elected officials were willing to take that position in favor of protecting our national security.  That's true.  That's true.  I'm not focused on the right objectives, but I remember that an eloquent legislator in Springfield, Illinois, named Barack Obama, spoke up boldly and clearly with the force of reason and logic to join in opposition to that blunder. 
[01:19:30]  What?  Did he?  Another awful speaker.  Al stinks.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  As far as public speaking goes.  He's no passion at all.  No.  Ah, trees, you're melting.  All right, we got it.  Because he's talking to inanimate objects all day. 
[01:20:00]  He yells at glaciers and they stare at him.  We're obviously getting smaller.  They stare at him.  That's what the problem is.  It's all that hot wind is melting the glaciers.  Stop talking by the ice.  You boar.  Yeah, Al Gore was using the Hillary delivery.  Yeah.  Yeah, that whole blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Great speakers.  I mean, look, Reagan.  Yes.  JFK?  Great speakers.  Yeah.  JFK.  Very natural.  He was a hack.  No.  What? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, how about I ask what my country can do for me?  Let's get back to that.  What can I do for my country?  I'll show up and smile.  Country's turn.  I would have said nothing.  Why don't you work for a little bit?  By the end of this decade, I would like a man on the moon and those other things.  What?  That's right.  Decade.  A man on the moon and the back of my head in the knoll.  By the end of this decade, I want the back of my head 50 feet from the rest of me. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Can do.  That I can do.  Oh, I want my head turned into a salad bowl.  I'd like a more efficient way of removing my hat to be invented by the end of the decade.  I want my hat removed by a third party. 
[01:21:30]  Topical material.  The Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  By the end of this decade, I want my wife picking my brains up like so many pieces of mac and cheese.  By the end of this decade.  How do they say it?  A decade.  Decade.  Decade.  I don't remember.  By the end of this decade.  Decade.  I'll go with that one.  I want somebody to redesign Jackie's awful pink outfit when she least expects it.  Spots for everybody. 
[01:22:00]  By the end of this decade, I want to make a sharp left doing two miles an hour and then  wonder why things went wrong.  You're listening.  Get your hog away from me.  To Opie and Anthony.  This is retarded.  Let's go hold hands and pee.  Now presenting comedian.  Andrew Dice Clay.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:22:30]  Now what?  I'm just glad that no one's feelings are hurt anymore.  Yeah.  Everybody was very sad on some level about it.  Everyone was sad.  Yeah, we know that.  Even here, because it's radio, it's hard to be, I don't know, completely real because  we got to almost put on a little show, but it's okay because it's a reason for us to  get together.  No, I mean, I'm being honest, but maybe a little animated.  Well, I can't see the mics going off and us going, you know, go fuck yourself.  No, no, no. 
[01:23:00]  This is nice.  I'm saying this was a good excuse to come in and discuss.  Yeah, that's why we didn't take a break yet, because I know damn well since those mics  go off is going to be like, no one wants to deal with that moment.  Oh, what?  You think it's going to be awkward?  No.  No.  Awkwardness in probably a good way.  A nice way.  That's what I mean.  Like, it's easier to do it on the air.  I came in here on the air.  I'm not mad.  Yeah, I didn't really, I wasn't ready for that.  You were ready for it.  You were okay.  I felt it.  I felt the vibe.  I was?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Helmets hit.  Well, now that you lost weight, that could happen, so. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Little joke, you know.  I get it.  See, I get it when you do the joke.  I'll find out if you get it five years from now.  Is that like a thing when you laugh, you move the mic?  Did I do it again?  I don't know.  Yeah, you got it.  We all got our thing.  Oh, I know why.  I'll tell you why.  Why do you do that?  Because I don't want to laugh directly in the mic, because some people think that's really  obnoxious.  Oh, really?  So I'm trying to laugh off mic.  That's all. 
[01:24:00]  That's all that is.  No, I thought it was like a thing, like when I put the cigarette behind the head.  You're still not smoking the cigarettes, I say.  Seven years.  But you still hold the cigarette.  Yeah, I like it.  Do you talk to anyone about these issues?  The fact I don't want to light it is a good thing.  But why do I need it at all?  Because they're free.  Like, why don't you walk around with your underwater phone instead?  You know, two picks don't do it.  I got the underwater phone.  I got the cigarette.  But you could be walking around with the underwater phone instead.  Get rid of the cigarette.  I like the cigarette.  I like it.  But you don't smoke the cigarette. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, but who says you have to?  I bet you have the same pack from four years ago.  No, no, no.  I go through like a pack a day.  Yeah, you have to.  It probably gets like loose and the tobacco falls out.  It goes through a pack a day, but he's not smoking.  I quit nearly, what, seven years ago.  Kenny would know.  Wow.  March of, uh...  I'm glad Kenny came over here.  Kenny, when did he stop smoking?  See, I didn't know you were going to be here, and Norton told me last night.  So it was like, we didn't tell Kenny, because we knew he'd obsess about it all day, and he  would be somewhere else.  Right, Kenny?  Yeah, I mean, I still didn't figure out what I was going to do, like, tomorrow when I was 
[01:25:00]  supposed to see you.  Yeah, that was the other thing.  I told Jimmy, it's going to be awkward for Kenny, too.  You got Dice on the show, which I think is great, and you haven't seen Kenny in many...  I think the shows are going to be great.  And you haven't seen Kenny in so many years.  I'm like, well, that's not fair to Kenny, that all of a sudden he's showing up not knowing  why Dice was mad at him for four years.  No, but does it...  Let me ask you something, to get off of, uh...  Oh, for a minute, here.  Okay.  Does it make sense what I'm saying to you? 
[01:25:30]  Uh, well, I never knew the reason.  All right, so why didn't you call?  Why didn't you call?  No, because, like, I knew from past experience, like...  Well, you could let it go a little while.  See, I would get mad, like, let's say after a month or two that we didn't talk, like, why  didn't you pick up a phone and go, what's going on here?  You know, because I'm also, you know, just for people that might not know, I know most people  do know, you know, that we were close for all the years, which means I'm close with 
[01:26:00]  your wife, your children, you know what I mean?  Right.  So it's not like I just lost you as a friend, it's, you know, and your wife has always been  completely dedicated to you, that even when, you know, it's funny, when Kenny first went  to work for me, you know, uh, I remember Michelle getting me on the phone and going,  so, in other words, when he's 80, he'll be walking next to you with a cane?  I mean, she would, like, think of it that way.  You know what I mean?  And, you know, just really concerned, and then years later, this was a little before 
[01:26:30]  it happened, she had me on the phone, and, you know, always concerned about our relationship,  not like she was out of it.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  She was always in there, and, you know, so it bothered me, because I always thought she  was great.  Right.  I actually just looked at those tapes of the Concord, I would do stare-downs with his wife,  because nobody could do them like that.  And I would say, I was actually showing Eleanor, and I go, I go, she's a cop's wife. 
[01:27:00]  That's why she could do it like that.  Right.  And one time, she looked right through one of my ex-wife's friends at a New Year's Eve  party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A friend that I just can't fucking stand, you know?  And Michelle comes in the kitchen and goes, all right, Ken, we gotta go.  You know, it's like one in the morning already, you know?  And this girl comes over, all fucked up already, you know?  You know, why don't you stay? 
[01:27:30]  And Kenny's wife, number one, I thought she was gonna throw this girl a beating, and she  just looked right through her, you know, like Doc Holliday in Tombstone.  Yeah.  Just looked right through her and went, I got two kids, I gotta take care of six in the  morning.  Do you?  And not even looking at Kenny, staring right through this girl, goes, let's go, Ken.  Oh, it was, but it was like, let's go before she kicks the shit out of this girl.  Yeah.  Because she knew how I felt about that girl. 
[01:28:00]  You know what I mean?  So, yeah, you know, and your kids, you know, you lose touch of all that.  That's a bad thing.  Yeah.  You know what's going on with his kids?  I don't know if he talks about it all.  Well, you know, a little known fact that when my boys were young, Andrew nicknamed my boys  combat and shootout, and as we speak...  No, I know that.  ...combat is going to Iraq tomorrow.  Tomorrow? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, he's leaving.  Oh, man.  Mm-hmm.  He's a cop in the Air Force.  Is he real?  See, I don't know the whole story.  It's hard to pull over a plane.  Yeah.  Hold on.  See, we do sound effects now.  It's fun, right?  That was an awful joke.  No, that's a heavy thing, and, you know, I just, you know, I just wish him, you know,  just health.  That's it.  You know, I love your boys, and that's how I feel about them, even if I didn't see you.  Right.  You know, I heard about it, and I was like, all right, let's just, you know, I pray for 
[01:29:00]  your boy.  Believe me, I love him.  Thank you.  So, you know, my sentiments are the same for your boys.  You know, we all grew up together.  I know.  It's on the road.  Yeah.  It's together.  Do you know, Jeffrey, his older son, when we did, we went to the Concord many years ago.  We thought we were going on a vacation, and every high school in the world was there.  You know, we just wanted quiet from the concerts, but that's not what I'm getting at. 
[01:29:30]  Jeffrey was, what, two?  Yeah, barely walking.  I mean, so all of a sudden, this is how he gets the nickname, because he's just walking  in this long hallway, and there's another kid, basically not doing anything, and Jeffrey  decided, why not just throw him a beating?  And we're running down this long hallway at the Concord Hotel, tackling this kid, and  just careening his fist into him, and I was amazed at it. 
[01:30:00]  I'm going, look at this kid go.  Right.  And then as time went on, and Jeffrey got a little older, because, you know, he's a tough  kid.  He would hit my hand when he was eight years old, and it would hurt.  But he once nearly beat up Norton in Kenny's backyard.  Oh, yeah.  That Norton was like, all right, no, all right, I get it.  You know?  And, um, but he would tell stories, like his war stories of kids having fights, and this 
[01:30:30]  is what's bugging me for a long time, and I couldn't call you to ask you, that me and  Max loved the speech that Jeffrey gives a kid.  He'll always warn the kid.  The kid, if ten guys walk over to Jeffrey, like, let's say he had a problem in school,  so now the guy comes like a bully with ten friends, Jeffrey will calmly look at the kid,  because one time a kid took off his belt buckle, right?  And Jeffrey looks at him, and what is the speech? 
[01:31:00]  You'll say it better.  You know it.  You know, it's funny that you bring, I'm trying to remember it too, but Jeffrey would  always try to make the other kid realize that he's making a big mistake.  A big mistake.  And say something like, this is your last warning.  Right.  You know, the next warning will be you on the ground with my fist just crunching your face  inside out.  It was something like that.  And he told us this story in a Chinese restaurant, and me and my son were mesmerized, that we started 
[01:31:30]  coming up for themes for Fetter.  Like, it's coming to a movie theater.  Like, this summer, Jeffrey Fetter moves to L.A., you know?  And you would see, like, a fist come into view, because, like, there's a lot of kids that  go to school in L.A. that aren't tough kids, that won't act tough.  And me and my son, Max, always go, what do you think Jeffrey would do to this kid?  Always. 
[01:32:00]  It's a constant.  I mean, this is over the last few weeks.  I go, are you kidding?  Fetter?  He would annihilate this part.  This guy would be retarded.  But we love it.  Coming this summer.  Yeah.  Fetter.  He's a big boy, man.  Well, last time I saw him, he was, like, six feet.  Is he tall now?  Yeah, yeah.  He's in shape, obviously.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because when Kenny came to the bar mitzvah, they were training in the gym.  They were in the cage. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  He's not as tall as Max.  He's not as tall as you, right?  What about Shootout?  He's spurting now.  Okay, good.  He's, you know.  That's so funny.  We used to love that.  That's what I'm saying.  All right, so that could be.  So we didn't see.  We aired it out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would say, yeah.  What's left is just the apology.  I love Anthony.  I would say, yeah.  The judge.  I would say, yes.  I guess what's left is just the apology from you. 
[01:33:00]  And then everything's good.  The most important thing is that there's no grudges held.  What?  Remember Tommy?  Yes, yes.  Of course.  With Salve.  I was trying to remember which line that was.  That's the most important thing.  When you make up, it can't be a fake make up.  No.  Throw all grudges out the window.  Yeah, that's how it's really got to be.  That's it.  Are anybody's feelings still hurt? 
[01:33:30]  For real?  Please.  Nope.  Too much.  I'd like to know if anyone's feelings are hurt because that's what prevents them from  being hurt again.  Jimmy, are yours hurt?  No.  I feel okay, actually.  Can I get some water?  Do you have a water gun?  I'll get it, Andrew.  Of course.  Oh, look at that.  Just like all time.  I got one.  I got one.  Come on, everybody.  Just like.  Just let him get it for you.  He'll go crazy if he doesn't let you get him water.  You know that, Dice.  Dice, the other thing that you need to know is Norton does a little therapy now.  He tries to bring his therapy onto the show. 
[01:34:00]  It's a little weird for everybody.  Nobody knows more about therapy than me.  He wants us to open up more and, you know, handle things differently.  I realized that yesterday.  Really?  But, you know, therapy's great.  I heard somebody to walk into a room and lay into for two hours.  Here's some water for you.  Here's your 200 bucks, you fucking cocksucker.  I used to love therapy.  When I first went to, you know what's funny?  When I first went to therapy was here in New York when my career took off.  And I didn't even go to therapy for me. 
[01:34:30]  I went to therapy to find out how to handle my own parents, if you remember.  Because my family was really, like, more overwhelmed than I was with what was going on with me.  And I was like, like, if I went up to my dad's office, it was like a shrine.  Like, all I saw was me on the walls.  And I complained to my mother going, I can't even go to my own office and get away from me.  You know what I mean?  That's what, you know, and that's the reason I even tried to live back in Brooklyn.  Brooklyn, because, yeah, on stage, it's a tremendous ego. 
[01:35:00]  I say, I'm the greatest, and that's it.  And I go out and I try to prove that time and time again.  Right.  But off stage, I always tried to stay humble and live back in Brooklyn.  And it was kind of an impossibility.  I mean, some people are very cool.  Some people don't get why you're living back there.  But I would go to therapy to go, my parents can't handle what I'm going through.  You know?  And it wound up just sessions of laying into the... 
[01:35:30]  But wasn't he just proud?  I have to jump in here.  No, he's extremely proud.  Right.  You know, and actually thrilled I'm doing this thing with Norton.  No, no.  It was all about being proud.  Because my dad was the same way.  I mean, he was my biggest fan, and he was so proud.  But it's also just trying...  Like, I would actually sit there when my ex-wife would be pregnant with Max,  and I would look at my mother and go,  Ma, let's talk about her being pregnant.  That's a pretty big thing.  We're having a child.  You know, they were just that proud.  And, you know, obviously, you know, I became something in this world 
[01:36:00]  because of their personalities.  But, you know, what I'm saying is I'd go to therapy,  and then what you talk about after that is,  so you know what the therapist told me?  Who really gives a fuck about a therapist's opinion?  Because I'd look at this little asshole with his glasses on,  going, well, it's your mother.  You know, shut the...  Then I'd get defensive to the therapist and go,  why don't you shut your fucking mouth about my mother?  Let's talk about your fucking mother, okay? 
[01:36:30]  And I'd really get angry at the therapist,  but then you walk out and you go,  you know what he said?  Who the fuck is he?  You know what I mean?  But to anybody that...  And I used to love looking at people sitting there when I'd come out  because everybody looks at the floor.  You know what I mean?  I go, what are you here for?  What fucked you up, you little slob?  You know?  But I think therapy is great.  I will pay just to lay into somebody for a couple hours. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  It's worth it just for that.  So fuck them.  And that's what therapy did for you.  That's what therapy is.  It's the easiest job as a doctor.  Gave you a punching bag for a couple hours.  Let me make believe I learned about the mind.  And then guys like us walk in there and go,  why?  And then when you realize they don't have the answer  and you're paying them 400 fucking dollars,  that's when they learn why you're there.  Because you tell them what you think of them  and what they look like and how they act 
[01:37:30]  and what their fucking lives are.  Yeah, they don't need any,  it's not any concrete thing like a doctor,  hey, I got this, take care of it.  Yeah, give me the 5K pill.  It's this vague fucking...  Give me some fucking penicillin and get out of my life.  You seem like a different dice.  Well, yeah.  Four years ago.  In what way?  What's the deal?  Obviously the divorce was brutal on you.  Yeah.  Brutal, right?  Brutal.  Is there anything else going on?  It's not the divorce, it's, I'm telling you,  it's the, I make fun of it, 
[01:38:00]  but it's the after effects of what goes on.  You know, that's why, you know, to be honest,  and Kenny would notice too,  that, you know, I'm really close with my boys  and just really want, you know,  especially when I left,  to make sure that they grow up,  and look who's talking,  without their minds getting messed up.  You know what I mean?  Because it's a very confusing time.  So, you know, I would look to just work.  I had no career goal.  It was more like go out, make a living,  and get home and be with your kids. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  You know, and that's what I've done,  and they're two incredible human beings,  you know, today.  You know, I got a 13-year-old going on 30  because they had to learn the hard way.  You know, they say never put the kids in the middle,  but that's what goes on.  I mean, you know, the therapist would say  you don't put kids in the middle,  but in reality, you can't help but do that,  especially if one or both parties,  you know, are doing the wrong thing.  You could only keep them out of it for so long. 
[01:39:00]  Not a huge respect on that.  So, yeah, you do change in certain ways.  You know, I went through another relationship,  you know, got engaged for the minute.  You know how that shit goes, Anthony.  No.  No, you didn't get married.  I got married once, and that was it.  No more engagement.  Yeah, because that was awesome.  I remember talking to you with that stuff.  No engagement, no nothing.  I lay it right on the line.  I'm not getting married.  It just ain't going to happen.  You got a girlfriend?  Ever again.  You got a girlfriend?  Right now, no. 
[01:39:30]  Now, I understand you went through some stuff.  Yeah, I got a girlfriend now.  Well, he's going on a date with a traffic girl today from TV.  Wait, fucking meet a maid.  No, not that kind of traffic girl.  Fucking meet a maid.  The worst people on fucking earth.  Oh, I hate them.  Meet a maid.  Now we can finally agree on something.  Hate them.  She's on the news.  She doesn't traffic on the news.  On the news.  Troubly. 
[01:40:00]  Traffic victim.  Oh, a traffic girl, like a helicopter chick.  Yeah, she used to be in a helicopter.  They brought her into the studio now.  She was too hot for the chocolate.  So she's on the news here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big shot, huh?  Look at you now.  You want to see her parents?  You're being dating celebrities.  Let me see a picture.  You're very nice.  On one of these big screens.  How much are you going to film with the camera?  How much do you think I need of this?  Bring it on.  I'm going to do it all day.  Bring me the camera.  All day long.  Steve, you remember Dice?  I do.  What's going on?  Hey, Dice.  Oh, he's putting up the good pictures. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, let me see.  Where is she?  No, these are the good pictures.  Uh-oh.  And it's going on a date with this girl.  Yeah, that was before the traffic career, I think.  Can I see it on it?  Can I see it here?  No, we're getting it up there.  There you go.  And it's going out with that tonight.  She's lovely.  So she does the traffic naked?  No.  That's why.  They should.  And she's on regular network?  Yeah, on Channel 11.  Yeah.  And so what's she posing here?  Playboy.  Old Playboy.  I mean, I'm sorry. 
[01:41:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, yeah.  Jesus fucking Christ.  I'm getting to see what you might be banging.  That's exciting to me.  Just going out to dinner.  Show the chair shot.  Tonight.  If she could do this, you think it's just dinner and, you know, what are your hobbies?  We're just going out to dinner.  Have a couple of drinks.  Can't you just say, can't you just do, can I take some pictures like they did?  Can't take some pictures.  Like they did. 
[01:41:30]  You go, look at her fucking lips down here.  This is beautiful.  I don't think so.  I think, you know.  What's her name?  Jill.  Jill.  Maybe she'd like me more than you.  Nice.  Can I go out with her, Jill?  What are you blocking me here?  You a cock blocker?  Yeah, why not?  What do I care?  What's that about?  We haven't been friends for four years.  I got to care?  Now, in two years, I'm going to be really pissed off.  Yeah, if you really fall in love with her.  You could fall in love with a girl like that, right?  Dude, your picture.  Oh, love.  When you Google search Jill Nicolini and go images, Anthony comes up. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, why does my picture come up?  I saw that.  My kid picture came up.  She's a good looking chick.  I'll tell you that right now.  She's lovely.  Why the hell is that picture coming up?  I don't know.  That's strange.  I like that she still keeps some box hair.  You know what I mean?  You know, don't you like a little bit?  A little.  You know, for the finger bang, so you can wipe your fingers off when you're done.  And let's say your finger banging her.  Oh, holy shit.  No, let's say your finger banging her, right? 
[01:42:30]  And all of a sudden, the doorbell rings and your friend's there.  So you just wipe it off on her so you can shake his hand.  You know, your fingers aren't dripping with whatever they do.  Whatever shit comes out of there.  As you get older, it seems like every fucking thing comes out of there with them.  You know what I mean?  I gotta tell you, I've never heard that one before.  Heard what one?  You use it just in case your friend's at the door.  Well, what, what, are you gonna shake his hand?  No, that's rude.  That's rude. 
[01:43:00]  I understand, but.  You know, was breaking into her box?  I would just think maybe you'd use your pants or something else.  No, it's higher.  Go shampoo it now.  Just enough there to wipe your finger off.  Exactly, that's a clear story.  All right.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah, why not?  What else are you gonna do with it?  That's what it's there for, if you didn't figure it out.  I didn't, thank God.  See, thank God this happened.  You live and learn. 
[01:43:30]  Even with your dick.  That's why you're banging her, right?  An actual bang.  You know what I mean?  Oh, someone's at the door.  I'll be right back.  And you wipe it off for a minute.  What do you want?  You want to get the stains in your beige pants?  No, no.  You wipe it off on a fucking, go do something with it already.  You know, dust off the furniture while I go answer the door.  Nice girl, though.  I like her.  Oh, well, yeah.  Well, I know you weren't talking about her in particular.  No, but what I'm saying is she left some there in case. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  She's a thinker is what I'm saying.  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  She's going, he might need box hair.  I don't know.  You know what I mean?  I don't know if she's saying that.  Every girl says that.  Yeah.  This is 2008.  I'm just looking to.  You know what I mean?  It's not years ago.  If it was, would she be posing anywhere but on your mouth?  Well, I'm just.  You know what I mean?  Dice, all I'm looking for is some nice conversation.  A nice dinner.  It never is.  Some drinks. 
[01:44:30]  And if that's all she's looking for, why is it up on a 25-inch screen?  Going, look at this.  Look at this selling point.  Because she's a beautiful girl and then decided, you know.  I'm not saying she's not.  And I don't disagree with what she's done.  You look at that and go, okay.  It's everything I need.  Tits, a box, and box hair for wiping my hands off.  See, we learned something today.  Yeah, I know a lot about these things. 
[01:45:00]  Well, he always has, yeah.  Yeah.  I've always been a master of that.  Hey, Dice, did we say anything today that we're going to find out about four years from  now?  No, no.  I'm good.  All right.  That's good to know.  You know what I mean?  So we got that going for ourselves.  You laid back.  You relaxed.  I like it.  Everybody good?  You good?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  I was waiting for the apology.  I'm very good.  Yeah.  Yeah, I feel great.  I saw a different Norton last night when he called me.  No, you know what?  I was like, wow, Norton was affected by his lunch with Dice yesterday. 
[01:45:30]  That's what I got out of that conversation.  No, because it was a very serious talk we had.  Like, what's got...  That's what he was telling me.  It really bothers Norton that we haven't spoken, that there's, like, different camps, and it  really shouldn't be.  You know, and I agreed with him.  That's why I said, you know, because he didn't think I'd come up here, and I go, I'll go up  there in a second.  What do I care?  As long as everybody's going to talk, and it's not just, you know, about, you know, destruction.  You know, that's all I cared about.  But I was like, if that's what it is, all right, it'll be one visit.  You know? 
[01:46:00]  But it's not.  This is good.  Silence.  You like that, right?  Yeah, I love that.  I saw that.  When we used to talk on the air, and it would just go to silence.  Silence.  And you would say, I forgot what you would say with that.  You would, well, like, it would, like, be a lot of silence.  Yeah.  Dead air.  Dead air.  Fired.  Nothing funnier than silence.  We didn't have a lot of material back then.  Dead air.  Dead air for the DJ.  And I'm on the phone, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on.  I go, why is everybody quiet? 
[01:46:30]  Oh, that was because we were messing with you.  With Silent Game, yeah.  Oh, like, I don't know how to mess.  Like, I'm not good at that.  Kenny, what is my real nickname?  Kenny.  Wait.  Hold on.  What did Robert Santa name me years ago?  Um.  What?  The Effect.  Oh, yeah.  Tell him.  The Effect Master.  The Effect Master?  The Effect.  Yeah.  Not Effect. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, nobody knows how to affect more than me.  Oh, okay.  He convinced this guy he was Superman and was going to fly by his window.  No, that was Dennis.  Oh.  That was Dennis Arthur.  Superman.  Yeah.  He called, I called him up.  I was bored to tears.  You know, this is like 1988.  So, he's only my agent for a minute.  Right?  So, um, at that time, my ex was not my ex.  So, she's on the other phone.  I go, all right, let's have some fun.  Right? 
[01:47:30]  So, I get the agent on the phone.  And I'm like, uh, yeah, how you doing, Dennis?  You know.  And he'd always hear me in a good mood.  You know.  He goes, you all right?  Ah.  Just had a fight with her.  You know.  You know, you think you go with a girl.  You could tell them some things about yourself and it'll be all right.  She's, she's inside laughing at me.  You know.  He goes, well, what's the matter?  You know.  I go, you won't get it, you know.  And, and if I told you, you're going to laugh and then I'll get aggravated.  And he goes, no, man. 
[01:48:00]  I mean, uh, you could tell me anything.  I go, I, I, I really can't, Dennis.  Because you're just not going to fucking get it, okay?  And I'm really upset from this.  Okay.  And I start to, like, cry a little on the phone.  He's going, calm down, man.  You can talk to me.  I'm not just an agent.  You know.  So I go, all right.  I'm going to tell you something.  You know.  And, and I just want you to hear it.  You know.  And not many people in my life know this about me. 
[01:48:30]  And he goes, tell me.  Tell me what she's laughing at.  Because if you want, I'll talk to her.  I'm Superman.  So now that's quiet.  And I go, see, you don't believe me.  Nobody but.  And he goes, well, I think you're a super guy.  I go, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm, I'm Superman.  I'm the real Superman.  Okay.  You go, so, like, you could lift heavy things? 
[01:49:00]  I go, yeah.  Like, I go, it's not like you see on TV.  But, yeah, I could fly.  I could, you know, I could do whatever the fuck you need to do.  I go, the reason I don't fly a lot is because I don't want to be caught by the radar and have to go back to my fucking planet.  So he goes, oh, so you could, you could fly here and come visit me right now.  I go, yeah, if you want.  I go, not a problem.  I could be there in three minutes.  You know, I'm in L.A.  And he goes, okay, I want you to do that.  I go, okay, this is what I'm going to do. 
[01:49:30]  And I'm only doing it because I love you.  I'm going to fly to New York.  I go, you know what floor you were on in your building.  Open your window.  I'm going to wave to you.  And then I'm going to come back to L.A., pick up the phone.  And you'll know I'm telling you the truth.  So now that's a little quiet.  And he's going, so you're going to be outside my window, like, with the red, you know, suit?  I go, no, I don't need the suit.  That's just TV shit.  I just fly.  And I fly at the speed of light. 
[01:50:00]  Nobody's going to see it, okay?  All right, the window's open.  And I said, you know what, Dan?  I said, I just got to tell you, you know, only because I do care about you, ready?  I go, it's very shocking when you see Superman.  And I go, and I'm just warning you.  I go, see, this is what I mean.  This has happened before.  There's a slight chance you might get a heart attack because you're not going to believe what you're actually seeing because it's really an unbelievable thing. 
[01:50:30]  So now he's like, I could get a heart attack from this.  I go, yeah, that's the only thing.  See, that's why I didn't want to have to prove it.  I'd rather you just, so, in other words, you'll be outside my window 50 floors up, and I'm going to die to see that?  I can't risk that.  So now he's all fucked up, and I just hang up on him and never told him the truth. 
[01:51:00]  That's an effect.  Do you think he waited?  I made this guy, Robert, my friend Robert, who named me the effects master, believe there was a two-inch girl in his dresser drawer waiting to meet him.  And if he likes her, I'll blow her up for him.  Because I'm on the phone with him.  It was raining outside.  I'm in L.A.  He's in New York.  This is how it happened.  And he goes, you know what I could use?  I wish I had, like, a beautiful, like, brunette right now.  It's a rainy day. 
[01:51:30]  I go, okay, done.  You know?  And he goes, what do you mean, done?  And I go, look out your window if you like her, I'll put her in the house, you know?  He goes, what do you mean, look out my...  I go, look out your window.  It's raining.  She's getting wet.  He goes, what are you talking about?  I go, Robert, you just said to me, you want a beautiful brunette.  I can do those things.  So she's right there.  Take a look.  I'll put her...  He goes, Andrew, I'm not getting up and looking out.  How the fuck would there be a girl outside?  Now he's getting me...  He's a Brooklyn guy, you know?  He's going, how the fuck did you get a girl outside my... 
[01:52:00]  I go, Robert, you asked for it.  I didn't ask to do it.  It's something you want, something I could fucking do.  Look out.  I go, where do you want her?  She's getting fucked.  I go, you know what?  Just open up your closet door.  You know?  I go, she's standing there.  Get some towels.  Dry her off.  You're going to love her.  I promise.  He goes, Andrew, I'm not getting out of my fucking bed.  I don't know what the fuck you're doing.  Because the guy didn't know me well.  He goes, I don't know what kind of fucking game you're playing with me.  I go, well, what do you want me to do with this fucking girl? 
[01:52:30]  It's too late.  You asked for her.  Are you afraid of a girl?  He goes, no.  How the fuck is there a girl in my closet?  He goes, you're 3,000 miles.  He's actually fucking fuming.  I go, all right, this is what I'll do.  Just open up your dresser drawer.  She's sitting on your underwear.  I go, she's only two inches now, so you don't have to be afraid.  And if you like her, I'll just blow her up to full size, and you can fuck her eyeballs  out.  Whatever you want to do with her.  Okay?  Have a good time.  He goes, Andrew, I'm not opening the drawer. 
[01:53:00]  If I open the drawer, and there's a little fucking girl there, I'm not going to know what  to do.  So that's when I get to laugh, and that's when I get to enjoy my time destroying somebody's  mind like that.  And after that, he named me the effects master.  There you go.  And there have been many since then.  But why wouldn't he just say, no, there's not.  Yeah.  No, there's not what?  A girl there.  Because he wouldn't look.  Because if by some chance, I'm so committed to it, that if by some chance, there's a two-inch  girl, in your drawer, you're either going to freak out. 
[01:53:30]  You're insane.  Or eat her.  You're insane.  Just swallow her and forget it happened.  You're insane.  Did you ever do an effect like that?  Uh, no.  All right.  So now I ask the jury.  You're insane.  Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my name is Arthur Kirkland, and I am the defending  the attorney for the defendant, Jim Norton. 
[01:54:00]  When did I get mad?  What happened?  You're on the witness stand.  Me?  Yeah.  When did I get mad about the Max thing?  Um, I don't know.  All right.  Let me ask you this question.  Did it happen at the time it happened?  I didn't feel like it was.  It wasn't really discussed, right?  Other than when I came up the day before the gun.  Honestly, I don't remember, I swear to you, I don't remember that we ever discussed the  Max thing.  That's right. 
[01:54:30]  That's the God's honest truth.  And we stayed friends.  I thought so.  For a couple years.  Well, when was that garden show, Kenny?  99?  2000.  October 2000.  It was game five of the Mets-Yankees World Series on a Thursday night.  So we were friends.  A couple years before that happened, right?  Two more years.  And then some of the time we were off the air.  And then it was the attack.  When we got back on the radio.  Yeah.  Then I attacked.  Yeah, it doesn't make sense.  That one I got to think about for a while. 
[01:55:00]  It was an effect.  You see what I mean?  The effect was that I thought we were real friends.  Yeah.  And I truly like you.  Okay?  Yeah, but that's mental.  No, it's an effect.  No, it's mental.  That's mental.  And you went nuts about it, right?  You went nuts back, though.  Yeah.  So I'm...  I fueled it.  I fueled the effect.  And I affect your back.  See the stories I just told you about Robert and about Dennis? 
[01:55:30]  Now you're it.  That's fine.  I can handle an effect.  We'll do an effect like tag thing.  Now you're it.  That's fine.  That's mental.  I like that.  Jesus.  Because Dan's the new effect.  Someone jacked me up.  He's insane.  This guy's insane.  I love when I drive him nuts.  You're insane.  I really do.  I'm just fucking with you.  You're fucking insane.  Donnie, wise guy always carries his money to the wall.  Never in a wallet.  All right.  So Nicky was a rat because Sonny Black said Nicky was a rat.  Nicky was a rat because Sonny Black said so. 
[01:56:00]  Kenny, he's got the...  That's a good one.  I can't...  I can't...  You get the memory of a play.  You see a net?  This guy haven't talked to you in four years.  I can't do right by a net.  I can't do right by a net.  I bet on a horse that horse don't do what it's supposed to do.  That and every other fucking thing in my life.  Thing.  We have only ten minutes left and they're going to turn off the computer.  Yeah.  You want to talk about more effects?  No.  It's tired.  I love it.  It's tired.  This always happens with him where it gets to the point he goes, you're nuts. 
[01:56:30]  It's like the Raging Bull.  You're really nuts.  You're crazy.  But I do enjoy that about you.  Yeah, but you're on the radio, right?  You make things interesting, that's for sure.  Yeah, exactly.  And why do you think Kenny likes me?  It's interesting.  But not with real life stuff.  You should have liked...  You should have liked...  No, I was actually angry about that.  It wasn't an effect.  But, you know, the things with Robert...  I'll summarize by saying I completely understand when it comes to family, especially...  That's right.  And I'm very serious about that. 
[01:57:00]  I know family and I understand that, but just how...  But that's why you don't understand it because you don't have them yet.  It's a whole different animal.  No.  Two years later, that's crazy.  It's not crazy if it's what you need to do.  It's just like here.  You're going to go get married.  Day one is going to be fantastic.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  And then it starts falling apart after the honeymoon, right?  Anthony, back me up on this.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  No, he was crying... 
[01:57:30]  Oh, sorry.  I'm sure your fiancé loves me already if she's listening.  No, I said I had tears of pain and frustration rolling out the corner of my eye.  Honeymoon night.  No, but this is what happens.  Dude, I wouldn't get married if I didn't think it was going to, you know, be something  The key word is think.  We'll stay happy and good.  Look, I wish you all the luck in the world with that.  I'm not even kidding about that.  I know what it is, you know, to be in love.  I know what it is when it falls apart.  You'll probably get married again.  We'll see what happens.  You almost got engaged or you were engaged.  Yeah, but I do things to keep it exciting. 
[01:58:00]  That's crazy talk.  But it's not crazy talk.  You got engaged for what?  For the goof?  No, not for the goof.  Okay, so what?  It was an impulse.  It was fun.  But if you don't believe in the marriage thing, why would you do that?  I do believe in marriage.  Well, I believe in it.  It exists, all right?  It's very hard to destroy.  No, but what I'm saying is if you're in a marriage that isn't working out all of a sudden,  sometimes it takes years, even in a regular relationship, years, till it does finally end. 
[01:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  So here comes animosity.  Here comes depression.  You got to be miserable.  Then you have like a good few weeks or a good couple months or maybe even a good year together,  and then it starts falling apart again, and sooner or later it ends.  So what I'm bringing out is sometimes what you're feeling at the moment doesn't come out for a few years,  just like the thing with Max.  So, yeah, I tried to ignore it to a certain point, and then it came out because he is my kid, 
[01:59:00]  and I do love him.  Yeah, I understand that part of it.  I do protect them.  You know what I mean?  But I'm not a chick.  And when you don't understand that because you don't have kids yet, but when you do,  it becomes a whole different thing.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  You're just protective.  You're their life.  You are who, especially in this fucking world today where parents aren't bringing up kids  and taking care of their kids the right way, that you've got a bunch of fucking dummies out there. 
[01:59:30]  I'm making sure that my kids grow up knowing what to do with their lives and guiding them,  actually guiding them rather than going, just go see what happens.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Every kid, not every kid, but all I hear are the stories.  You know, my son didn't go to his prom because he goes,  Dad, all they're going to do, which he sees every day, drinking, you know, getting stoned.  He doesn't even want to deal with that.  There was a girl he liked in school, thought she was the greatest thing.  He went to a party. 
[02:00:00]  He goes, Dad, she was so drunk, she sickened me, you know, and just didn't want to deal.  He doesn't want to deal.  Like, we're not living in a day and age also where you could just, you know,  stick it in everything you fucking meet.  You know what I mean?  So he wants a nice girl.  He doesn't want some pig that's just going to be, you know, do filthy things for him.  Right.  Let him meet a nice girl that'll do filthy things.  You know what I mean?  So you try to guide your kid.  What's the definition of a nice girl? 
[02:00:30]  She doesn't take it in to shit her?  Kenny's bonding with dice.  What's your memory?  Why does that bother you?  If we're making up, wait a minute.  If we're making up, why can't I make up with Kenny?  He's a little worried.  I'm making jokes.  He's a little worried that, you know, Kenny's going to be like...  Joel already said he'll pick me up tomorrow.  I got it right here.  I'm serious.  You need to see it.  Mike sees an opportunity.  He's jumping on it.  Now, I do have to ask you this.  You swear that you weren't part of the Howard dead dad jokes.  It's not my thing, okay? 
[02:01:00]  It's just not.  Because a lot of people are calling me out and like, dude, he did.  He was part of that.  I know you were there that day.  Was I sitting there?  Yes.  No, I know that much.  I tried.  Number one, I didn't even think it was about you.  I thought it was...  Because I can't...  I was defending man cow at that moment.  And I'll be honest, because a lot of people are saying, well, play the audio.  You know, this is going...  You know what?  Hold on, hold on.  This is way bigger than radio is going on today.  And I can't...  I personally can't hear that shit.  Well, that's the reason...  And I don't want to hear that shit.  So I got to take your word for it. 
[02:01:30]  That you weren't part of that shit.  Because that's a rough...  Well, you know what?  That's something I would swear to as far as remembering.  Right.  You know, because I just know me.  I know me really well.  I know when I'm fucking around.  I know when I'm serious.  You know, and that's just not where I go.  I'll say anything about you.  I'll say if I'm mad at somebody...  You were extremely angry that day.  And you were definitely taking your shots.  I still wouldn't go there.  And then Dice was definitely...  I don't go there.  Dice, sorry, sorry.  Howard was doing his, you know, his dead dad jokes, which is hilarious.  Because he'll lose his dad someday. 
[02:02:00]  And then he'll maybe understand exactly what that's about.  Not that I wish that upon anyone.  And I'm being honest.  That's why I don't understand why you would go there.  But you see, I'm even looking at your face when you say, I would never go there.  I tried getting you on the phone for a long...  I felt sick when I heard that news.  Right.  You know?  And I knew you didn't want to talk to anybody.  And, you know, Pete...  Well, that's one of the things that I wish I handled differently.  I wish I had reached out to a lot of people.  No, but I wasn't mad about it.  But I shut out everyone.  Understandably. 
[02:02:30]  You know, I can't even joke about it now.  And I wouldn't.  And I never would.  It's just not who I am.  It's not who I am as an angry comic.  It's not who I am as a person.  You know?  I...  You know, like I said, when you have kids, you've got to look them in the eye.  I don't...  I could look them in the eye because I know nothing I do is wrong.  From my stand-up to who I am as a man to who I am as a father, I don't do the wrong  thing.  If I would have said something like that about you, I couldn't look at them.  Right.  That's how it is.  You know?  And that's what it means to me, so... 
[02:03:00]  I know you were taking your shots at me personally.  You know, calling somebody a hack or saying they're not talented, are you on the radio  every day?  But this is what I'm saying.  You wouldn't be on the radio if you weren't doing a good job.  That's it.  That's the bottom line.  Even if I didn't like what you did.  Okay?  But I was just taking shots because I'm angry.  Just like I fought with Howard all the years.  It was way worse.  It was awful what we would say about each other.  We made up.  That's it. 
[02:03:30]  Because we both really like each other personally.  And that's what it comes down to.  And that's what Norton was bringing out yesterday.  That, you know, all this bullshit, you know, fighting with, you know, comics fighting with  comics, you know, talk show guys fighting with talk show.  It's all bullshit stuff when all we should really be concentrating on is the job of making  people laugh.  See, people, the fans don't understand what it takes to make them laugh.  You know, and if you're just walking around with real anger, you can't make anybody laugh. 
[02:04:00]  I love going up and just seeing crowds rock back and forth in laughter, you know, which  is, you know, why, you know, I'm excited about doing this thing with Norton that he wanted  me for this thing.  HBO wanted me for this thing, you know, and...  Filming tomorrow and Thursday.  You know, they, you know, actually, they looked at it like I'm doing a favor to me to walk  out in front of the country and make them laugh is not a favor.  It's, it's my pleasure because also on shows like this, this is not about money. 
[02:04:30]  This isn't about doing a gig where big paydays, they basically pay nothing for these shows.  This is about the love of performing.  And, you know, I started to love it again about three years ago to be on stage again and really  make people laugh and even, you know, the fact that we did go through it, I don't like  that, you know, but I felt I had to be honorable to my own son and that was it. 
[02:05:00]  I respect that part of it.  We, uh, we come from a very similar place.  Like I was, uh, you don't know shit about me in the last four years.  I've, I've grown as a person.  Jimmy knows probably more than anyone.  I'm not as angry as I used to be.  And, uh, I'm having a lot of fun doing this again, a lot of fun.  So you understand what I mean?  I didn't have, I didn't have a lot of fun at the end of the N.E.W. run.  I don't know if it was the pressure.  I don't know if it was what was going on.  Yes, and we were close then and I saw what you went through.  I don't know if I, uh, I, I was miserable in my personal life. 
[02:05:30]  I don't know if the pressure of what Ant and I were doing on a daily basis was getting  to me.  I wasn't having fun.  I'm having a ball now.  But you were miserable because our conversations off the air.  Oh yeah, you probably knew more than most.  No, I'm saying what you were talking about back then, you were, you were absorbed in  the misery.  Yeah.  You know, and that's when, you know, at that time I was absorbed in misery too.  So, you know, all of a sudden, if you really got something going on, if you really have  that funny bone, it comes back and you start enjoying being in front of the audiences. 
[02:06:00]  That was a time I didn't like being in front of them because I was so unhappy, you know,  so it's like, uh, I got to go up.  They can't know that I, you know, they want to let now put on the face.  I've been destroying the way, the way I always did because gardens across America, that's  right.  Because I'm happy doing it again, you know, and that's where new material comes into play.  And, you know, that's where, you know, the delivery comes into play and, and the audience 
[02:06:30]  is really, I went on at that, uh, the comedy cellar last night, just so much fun just to  be up there, small little place.  Great, great fucking club.  Yeah, sure.  You know, you've been there, right?  You know what I'm talking about.  And, and I went on after Norton and just, you know, they just want to laugh today, people,  you know, with, with everything going on.  And, and I just felt good being up there and making them laugh the way I did, you know,  and making, this is music that's going to knock on the computer.  The computer shut this off.  I do have to say really fast, line of the day, we're not doing it today, brought to 
[02:07:00]  you by Three Doors Down with over 12 million albums sold worldwide and eight number one  singles.  They're back with a new album available everywhere today.  Uh, this self-titled album includes the number one hit single, It's Not My Time, on sale  at Best Buy for only $9.99.  I guess we have to say to be continued, my friend.  To be continued.  To be continued.  I'm glad that came up, really.  All right.  You know.  Glad you did too, absolutely.  No animosity from this side of the table.  No.  I respect the fact that it came up today.  Absolutely, man. 
[02:07:30]  And you guys have a good taping tomorrow and Thursday.  Yeah, it should be great.  And, uh, I'm very tired and I kind of have to shit.  Kenny, the last word is to you today.  Excuse me?  The last word is to you.  I, I just can't get over the love in the room.  Yeah, he means it though.  He, that's how Kenny does it, you know.  Can we agree to hate him at least?  But I don't hate him.  And I'm glad I came up here.  That's all.  Absolutely.  And I'm glad to see you guys. 
[02:08:00]  Okay.  Yes.  I got a little choked up at one point.  Slightly.  One part.  One part.  When he was talking about Kenny's sons.  Yeah, absolutely.  Very nice.  There were some tears in the room.  Very nice.  All right.  Jesus.  Thank you.  You joke about it.  I was serious.  I know.  He's serious.  It was.  That wasn't a joke that time.  All right.  I do real moments.  I do real moments now on the show.  I do.  I know.  I know.  And I know how sensitive you are.  Well, thanks.  I do.  You are.  That's what we talked about at last.  I know.  I'll admit it.  All right.  You're more sensitive though.  Yeah.  Who else cried on Arsenio? 
[02:08:30]  That's right.  And a little more crazy than me.  A lot more.  Yeah.  All right.  Good.  That's good enough.  A little more.  I'll be flying by your office in three minutes.  Yeah.  With little people in the drawer.  Yeah.  I'm sure if you were making 500 a week, he would have tolerated the conversation.  It wasn't the two million a month.  And he wanted us to believe that the guy believed.  I'm like, okay.  I believe you're a super guy.  Get out of here.  We'll see you guys soon.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, my goodness.  And you're going to film this thing.  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:09:00]  Are you going to look who's here?  In the studio, Andrew.  Andrew.  Nice clay.  Hey, hey.  I don't even know where to begin, to be honest with you.  We had all these moments.  We sat in your temporary apartment you had to get.  And we hung out for hours.  You made me stir fry.  And we were watching the videotapes.  We went to the supermarket together.  Went to the gym.  We did a little shopping as you were in your silly outfit.  And we went to the Gold's Gym and worked out for maybe seven minutes.  And then we went on a hike. 
[02:09:30]  What about the picture me and you after the garden show?  Just me and you in the empty garden.  Yeah.  Having a moment.  What about going to the deli?  How many memories you want to bring up?  How about when we went sweatshirt shopping?  I remember that.  What about when we picked out Silverware and we were going to move in together?  What about that?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian Jim Brewer.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:10:00]  How was Spinal Tap last night, Anthony?  Oh, rock.  Yeah?  Yeah, I had a lot of fun, man.  Spinal Tap.  Saw him last night at the Beacon.  Had a star-studded audience, Opie.  A lot of people were there?  Star-studded.  Was it the place to be last night?  It seemed to be the place to be, yes, for the likes of Penn from Penn and Teller, the  guy from Will and Grace, Will from Will and Grace.  Is he the gay guy?  He's one of the gay guys on the show, but I think he overcomes it out in public by just 
[02:10:30]  always being wrapped around his hot wife, girlfriend, whatever she is.  It's hysterical.  Yes, I'm gay on the show, but look, I'm going to F a girl right here in front of you just  to prove I'm not.  That's going to suck that you're the gay guy in a hit sitcom if you're not gay.  Because you know the gay guys just probably come up to him all the time.  I just love you.  Get out of here, faggot.  So he ran into the gay guy from Will and Grace, but he's not gay.  I didn't run into him, Opie. 
[02:11:00]  The way you make it sound like I ran into him.  But he's not gay because he was with his hot wife or girlfriend or something, and he made  sure everyone was checking him out when he was with his hot wife or girlfriend.  Right.  Okay.  Making sure.  I got it.  And I think he was trying to be a little bit of a tough guy in front of his girlfriend.  A little tough guy.  What, slapping around a little bit?  Well, no, that would have worked, though.  That works, too.  No, he's sitting in his seat watching Spinal Tap, and his chick is on the aisle seat,  right?  And he's next to her.  And some people were walking in the aisle, and his girl couldn't see. 
[02:11:30]  So he kind of leans over.  His girlfriend taps the guy and goes, hey, she can't see.  And the guy just turns around and goes, shut up, faggot.  He didn't.  No, he moved.  But he said, shut up, faggot.  But, and then at one point they got up, and right before he sat down, someone threw a  drink in his chair.  So he sat, and his ass got wet, just like a real gay guy.  Come on.  Gay guy's sitting in seats that people have dumped water on or something. 
[02:12:00]  Anthony, we're on in San Francisco now.  Cut it out.  Welcome.  We're going to make a good impression for everyone listening in San Francisco.  Come on, everyone.  That's a winner.  We welcome everybody.  So what else happened at Spinal Tap?  Oh, we got a clip of somebody talking to the guy from Will and Grace.  Friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something?  That's horrible.  That's not him.  So is Penn the one that talks or doesn't talk?  The big one.  The big guy that talks. 
[02:12:30]  Okay.  All right.  He was there.  Also, Stephen Van Zandt from, of course, the E Street Band.  And the Sopranos.  The Sopranos.  Now, everybody knows.  More people are coming up to him asking him about taking pictures with him because they  know him from the Sopranos than from Springsteen.  And then he's talking to me about he wants a show on WNW here in New York.  He wants to do a what?  A talk show?  No.  He wants to do like a garage rock show. 
[02:13:00]  We already have the Eddie Trunk show there on Saturday night.  And he does a good job with that.  No, it'd be like, you know, something on the weekend where he would do something.  I'm like, all right, you know, I'll talk to Ken Stevens for you.  Bada bing.  Just like, hey.  He was pitching you a rock show.  I do you a favor.  Maybe you do me a favor.  Bada bing.  Does he understand we don't really play music anymore on this radio station?  That's something I don't know.  See?  Yeah.  No, I think he knows that, but I think he was pitching some kind of weekend show. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  Yeah.  And Spinal Tap rocked.  You know, they did all the hits, but they were kind of, I'm sorry, they're kind of dicks.  They really are.  Well, yeah, they blew us off yesterday.  They blew everyone off.  Everybody.  It's just amazing because we presented the Spinal Tap show.  Opie and Anthony present.  Says it on the ticket.  We're concert promoters as well in our spare time.  Yeah, for some reason.  I don't know what that entails.  We have presented Andrew Dice Clay in the past and now Spinal Tap. 
[02:14:00]  So.  At the garden.  You would think if we're going to help them sell tickets for their show, because it wasn't  sold out, right, Ant?  Yeah.  They would, I don't know, maybe, you know, come down to the station and, you know, hang  on our show.  They blew us off.  Yeah.  Totally blew us off.  And I heard they were kind of dicks to their fans and backstage last night, huh?  We're hanging out backstage and it was hard enough for me to get a pass.  I got one pass.  And for me and my girlfriend. 
[02:14:30]  And that was it.  I have my brother Joe, Cowbell Bill hanging out, Big Kev, Joe Curry.  Everyone I went with had to sit out there and then I got my messages on the phone later.  Dude, man, I guess you couldn't get us in and stuff, but, you know, it's cool.  I enjoyed the show.  So I'm the, I'm the dick.  I'm the bad guy.  Now I'm the bad guy.  You need a person like me.  You need me.  I'm the bad guy.  You got to take care of your entourage, Anthony.  Well, I didn't see anybody. 
[02:15:00]  I saw fleeting glimpses of people that were in Spinal Tap.  The Anthony entourage.  My entourage.  My peeps.  I'm like P. Diddy.  I'm P. Diddy.  I'm P. Diddy.  P. Diddy.  So I go back there.  I barely see Spinal Tap, you know, the guys.  They leave through the back door to go to their limos.  There's people waiting outside for autographs.  Not a lot of people.  But there's like guys waiting out there for some autographs with some Spinal Tap memorabilia.  Nothing.  They walked right past them. 
[02:15:30]  Right past them.  Maybe they were, you know, trying to be rock stars.  Hey, look, you know, you're taking your Spinal Tap thing a little too friggin' seriously.  It was a goof band, a movie, back in like 1982, 83.  Maybe they're gay.  Maybe they're gay.  Hey, faggot.  Maybe they're...  Nice head, dicks.  Where you going?  You two big now, faggots?  You sucked on SNL, dick!  Jim Brewer in the studio.  I'm big for you, faggot! 
[02:16:00]  Were you on SNL during the time any of them were on?  No.  No?  No?  Yeah, they missed each other.  Right, right.  Really?  Michael McKeon wasn't on, like, a part-time thing?  He was on for, what, a season?  Yeah, I know.  All those guys are.  They were on for, like, ten minutes.  Yeah, Christopher Gass.  The only one that was on a short amount of time was Anthony Michael Hall.  Oh, God!  Do you remember that?  Oh, yeah.  The Anthony Michael Hall month.  Wasn't that Julia Dreyfuss, too?  Yeah, yeah, she was on, sure.  Michael Anthony was on a tear, too. 
[02:16:30]  I mean, he kind of had the gayish geek thing going, but you loved him.  Because he got high in that movie.  He had that growth spurt, and it was all over.  And then all of a sudden, I was like, what happened?  Now I think he's in that.  I'm starting live.  I think he's in that movie, that Def Leppard VH1 production.  What?  Who's he playing?  I don't know who he's playing, but he's definitely in the Def Leppard movie.  I play the drummer's leg.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Def Leppard movie tomorrow night.  They made a movie?  It's a VH1 movie.  It's a VH1 movie.  Like, they cast...  Did they act it in? 
[02:17:00]  No, no, it's not them.  They cast people as Def Leppard, which is hysterical.  Where did they get the one-armed actor from?  I have no idea.  Arm, leg, whatever.  Arm?  No, I know.  But who cares?  I know my amputees.  Arm, leg, whatever.  I know my amputees.  So I saw some dramatic moments of him in the hospital, you know, and the fake Def Leppard talking to him, you know, trying to act like Def Leppard.  We're still going to be a band.  Yeah, stuff like that.  We're still going to rock it. 
[02:17:30]  We're still going to be a band.  We're not giving up on Def Leppard, no.  We're going to still be a band.  Photograph will live on.  We'll be back with more of the Def Leppard story on VH1.  So back to Spinal Tap.  Back here!  Back here!  Back here!  Back here!  Back here!  Shut up!  Shut up!  How annoyed must the room into those guys be? 
[02:18:00]  Food!  Shut up, bitch!  Shut up!  Yeah, here we go.  VH1.  Behind the music.  presents  Def Leppard.  But not really Def Leppard.  In the not really Def Leppard story.  And the guy with the missing arm.  But he's not really missing an arm.  How did they do that?  We'll show you on Behind the Def Leppard movie.  Behind the music.  See how they struggled on to perform songs like Love Bites. 
[02:18:30]  Love Bites.  When you need love.  Pour some sugar on me and rock it.  Yeah.  Watch how they were gang raped by five black rappers after a concert one day and still survived on.  Make your own British flag shorts.  Just like the drummer.  The movie Hysteria.  Def Leppard.  Starring people that kind of look like Def Leppard.  Yeah. 
[02:19:00]  I'm there.  I'm there.  That says watch me.  How cheesy was the blonde guy?  Remember the blonde guy?  They all were blonde, though.  Tight pants.  No, no, no.  The short blonde hair guy.  Hey, and then the guy died.  Wait a minute.  The one long hair guy died.  Did he shoot himself or something?  No, he got like so effed up all the time on booze and drugs.  Oh, that's got to be a great part of the movie, too.  Oh, bandmates dead, but the band's got to go on.  We're missing a leg in a play, but we can still sing Love Bites.  Oh, me gone, me foot fell off, but we could still be a band. 
[02:19:30]  See Def Leppard as they transform into a band of nothing but heads.  Heads.  Singing heads.  My body rotted off, but we're still a band.  We've got to keep Def Leppard together.  Singing heads.  They're bringing their heads out.  Shut up.  They're bringing them out.  They're bringing them out of the sea.  Look, it's the head.  They're putting them on the stool, man.  Shh.  A story of courage and bravery, as Def Leppard is just heads. 
[02:20:00]  Death heads.  I had to learn how to play the guitar all over again when I was just a head.  It's hard to re- I had to re-teach myself guitar.  Of course, I had to play with me tongue.  With special guest Ozzy Osbourne as he comes in and grims one head and bites it in half.  And then shoves the other half in his pooper.  Well, it's quite amazing.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  It's just a head.  I feel we would snort some lines. 
[02:20:30]  It's just a head that cocaine came right out the neck.  I think I'm going to say it.  It's my head.  See the story of courage, bravery, a story no one gives a flying F about.  Def Leppard in Torso Rock.  See, they're choking on their own vomit stories. 
[02:21:00]  Def Leppard hysteria.  I don't know what they're saying either.  It was great.  We're all still buds from long ago.  And no matter how many body parts fall off, we got to keep the band together.  We were abused.  I remember one time we went out with Metallica and they used their heads for kickballs. 
[02:21:30]  It was not funny.  Lars got real drunk and he ordained it on my wife.  I remember one time the bass player, he's still just a head, decided to take a drive.  And he got in a horrible accident and lost his ears.  And since he played the bass with his ears on his head, he had to teach himself all over how to play without the ears.  Hysteria. 
[02:22:00]  See how one of them finally went into a movie career and entered the movie Castaway.  The Roadshow.  The stage production, London of Castaway.  What was the guy's name, Castaway?  The part of Wilson.  Wilson.  Wilson!  I used to be named a Wilson.  Wilson!  Hey, Matt, what's up?  Yes, I got a real good feeling that they're going to have to change the name of that movie to Hysterical.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Hysterical.  Big, big herb tomorrow.  Do some bong hits.  It's going to be funny.  Right on.  Well, they got the bad wig jobs and stuff.  Yeah, the bad 80s British rock guy wigs.  That just look really bad.  Even Spinal Tap's wigs last night were just like really bad.  Like for the movie, they were bad.  And then I saw him backstage, the Spinal Tap guys, just kind of walking around because they weren't hanging with anybody.  And it was frightening because they come out and Christopher Guest, I mean, completely bald, he's gray, like beard, fat. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  And you're like, wait a minute.  That's not Nigel.  What happened to Nigel?  What happened to Nigel?  I knew you should have given him the big bread.  He wanted big bread.  How many times do you think he sits in a bar and someone goes, hey man, say, this one goes up to 11.  Hey, this one goes up to 11.  Could you shut up?  Oh, wait.  I don't even have the accent. 
[02:23:30]  Look, could you shut up?  That's not what he said.  Do the accent, man.  No, really, I'm really busy.  Say 11.  They have the mini Stonehenge?  Yeah, the little Stonehenge came down.  And oh, how they danced to little children of Stonehenge.  And the Stonehenge comes down and the little dwarf dances around it.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Were they in the pods?  No, they didn't have anything like that.  Oh, they didn't do the pods?  No, and it was sponsored by some kind of fake, like, Depend undergarment. 
[02:24:00]  So they had, like, big flyers in the back for these fake undergarments.  There it is.  Long ago, before the dawn of history.  Hundreds of years.  Before the dawn of history.  Lived a strange race of people.  The druids.  He's seen that movie too many times.  Yeah, you gotta get out of the house.  Tony, what's up?  Who doesn't love the movie? 
[02:24:30]  The guys are dicks, but...  Brewer's a sick bastard, man.  Oh, we love Jim Brewer.  Dude, buddies of mine went to the show.  Yeah.  Best way to piss him off, say, hey, where's Squiggy, dick?  Oh, Michael McKeon?  Dude, he had a...  Wait, you guys actually did that?  A friend of mine did.  They wouldn't give him autographs.  They were being dicks, so he goes, hey, where's Squiggy, dick?  Welcome to Michael McKeon.  Hello.  Dude, he shot him off.  Hey, Levine. 
[02:25:00]  That's funny.  That is very funny.  Hello, Levine.  Nice head, dick.  Where's Squiggy?  Thank you.  Good night.  Where's Squiggy, dick?  Yeah, I see you in Oceanside, faggot.  Where the banshees live and they do live well.  Hysteria.  You wouldn't even know that we're playing spinotap music  because we couldn't get the rights to the real music.  I wonder if they performed the Def Leppard songs 
[02:25:30]  or if they actually got permission to use the songs.  It was a just bad cover band version.  I remember hating him so much one time,  I'd go out and beat Mexicans for that one video.  What was it?  Once bitten?  Remember?  He was so over-exaggerating.  He'd go up, no, no, no.  He'd go up, when you make love.  Oh, that one.  Yeah.  Me and Nick in the...  I'm going to get drunk and fight a Mexican.  Enough already.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  What the hell does that mean? 
[02:26:00]  All the chicks love them.  The chicks really like them.  And the bad videos.  That was like at the beginning of MTV  with the swords and the chicks in the cages and stuff.  Like, what does this even mean?  Photograph.  Photograph was kind of a story.  Wasn't it like the Marilyn Monroe kind of story going on?  They were taking pictures of the Marilyn Monroe.  Wow, this is so good.  One of the eight videos they played on MTV 
[02:26:30]  before they went...  ...and showed the Apollo rocket  taking off 800 minutes of the day.  Was that guy a black guy?  Remember the one guy?  The big...  J.J. Jackson.  J.J. Jackson.  J.J. Jackson.  All right, it's J.J. Jackson here.  We're going to premiere Thriller for you tonight.  Great, J.J.  Great.  They gave J.J. all the black artists.  You'd be banging your pillow to Nina Hartley.  Oh, Nina Blackwood.  Nina Blackwood.  And who looked just like a space cadet.  Martha Quinn.  Like she was on the dope.  Alan Hunter.  Martha Quinn was like the homebody. 
[02:27:00]  Alan Hunter.  Wow.  Mark Goodman.  Mark Goodman.  Yeah, Martha Quinn was like the homebody chick.  The girl next door one.  And then there was a Nina Blackwood.  The rock who-a.  Hey, you're a rock who-a.  You know she was just...  D-R-R-W.  You just know she was honing everyone's knob.  Jesus.  I was like, hey, look who's here, man.  Take your shirt off.  See what you got, you D-L-R-W.  Nina, let's see your boobies. 
[02:27:30]  She's a dirty little rock who-a.  We should take a break.  All right.  Hey, Jim Brewer's here to hang with us for a while, man.  Nice.  Brewer.  Nice visit, Dick.  Finally.  Jesus.  We kept saying, Brewer's on today.  We're psyched.  Brewer coming in.  No, Brewer's not coming in.  What happened?  Wow.  He couldn't get a sitter, I hear, the other day.  Nice.  Dick.  A sitter.  A real man.  Look at Brewer.  He's playing all our cities, man, that we're in.  Oh. 
[02:28:00]  Since Dallas, San Francisco, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, and Philadelphia.  On the Hysteria Tour.  All covered by VH1.  Okay.  Where am I playing?  I know exactly.  What?  When it gets closer, we'll tell everyone.  What time is it?  Yeah.  Hey, it's Jim Brewer, and you listen to the Cream of the Crap on OP&O.  You know what?  You know what?  I don't have to say what you're listening to.  You listen.  You know exactly what you're listening to.  You guys listen to this every day.  So I don't need to do this.  Enjoy. 
[02:28:30]  Obi and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian...  Nick DiPaolo.  The best book I ever read.  It may turn me into the angry fucking white guy that I am.  But Robert Bork, Slouching Towards Gamora.  You ever read that book?  No.  Fellas...  I'm reading a book on rounds right now.  That'll change it.  Good one.  That'll change it.  Who runs the media, and why, and they're socialists.  Listen, how they hate the nuclear family.  That's why the dad's an asshole in every commercial.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he heads the nuclear family. 
[02:29:00]  And if you're going to have a socialist revolution, you can't do it unless everybody's an individual.  You can't have little pockets of fame.  Oh, yeah.  It makes so much frisk.  Oh, that's pretty good.  I'm telling you.  Well, Nick fucked me on commercials.  I'll have to pick that one up.  He actually said something.  He's flouching towards Gamora.  You actually say all the time about it, because I never...  I always watch commercials.  Yeah, now you do, don't you?  Now I watch commercials.  I'm like, wow, that guy really is fucking a pussy.  Oh, it's just every commercial guy is a fucking idiot.  It's about emasculating white men.  That's all television has become. 
[02:29:30]  I don't give a shit.  On the way in here, I listened to one of your ads.  It was a 30-second blurb.  It's a little girl saying to the father, well, if you're scared, I'll go down the ski slope for her.  It's just fucking relentless.  And my wife is ready to leave me, because I can't not point it out.  And my father's doing it now.  And my mother's ready to leave him.  Oh, fuck.  I gotta take notice now.  Just watch...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, but when you watch a Super Bowl, you'll get an inundated...  If you watch football every Sunday, I can't fucking take it.  I can't...  I'm pretty observant, usually.  I've never picked up...  It's always a dumb... 
[02:30:00]  Oh, my God.  I gotta check this shit out.  There's a yoga commercial, and she's on the phone, talking.  Well, I'm losing weight.  And he's just like an ape searching through the...  Yeah, I've seen that commercial.  There's one where...  There's one for blinds.  And there's two women by the blinds, and they're watching the husband out by the barbecue.  With the barbecue, blowing himself up.  And he's blowing himself up, because he's just a fucking retard.  Fucking idiot.  Idiot.  And there with the blinds, like, oh, there's my asshole.  There's my sperm donor, so I can have kids.  Yeah.  And you can see right through them.  That's the fucking line.  Yeah, yeah.  For the blind thing.  Yep.  And you can see right through... 
[02:30:30]  Imagine saying that about a broad showing her fucking up in the kitchen.  They have a bunch of dykes in front of fucking CBS.  Exactly.  And a bunch of guys are just laughing at her, like, you're my dumb bitch.  She can't do shit.  Oh, forget about it.  Now we'd be everywhere.  Can you fucking imagine that?  Yep.  That does mean, though, that white guys are still doing well, because what happens is  we're the only safe targets, meaning it's obviously so ludicrous.  It's getting smaller, though.  It is, but I'm saying it's so ludicrous.  Like, everybody...  Like, if you do a woman in the kitchen, you're right. 
[02:31:00]  You know what?  That is what that bitch does.  She cooks.  But if it's a guy, it's like, oh, pick on the strong one.  That's the weak picking on the strong.  That's the way they see it.  That's why, in a way, it annoys me.  But that's where it comes from.  Oh, like, you make a great joke about the fucking...  Oh, the joke about the dad and the computer.  So he's even dad can figure it out.  Yeah.  And you're like, oh, who, the guy that bought the fucking computer?  Yeah.  I love that one, yeah.  But there's too much truth in it the other way.  Like, this is almost an exaggeration that's ridiculous, and that's why this is so...  But what it's doing is it's fucking... 
[02:31:30]  It has tainted the fucking subconscious of a whole generation of broads who...  You get, like, my nieces wearing a shirt, you know, boys are stupid.  It says on the T-shirt.  Seriously, at what point do you, like, fucking...  And then I read a whole article in the Post how, you know, 91% of school teachers, middle  school teachers are women.  All the curriculum, there's no...  There's no kids don't...  Little boys don't get to read about adventurous shit and stuff they like to do.  It's all kind of been feminized.  Sure.  And the kids who are... 
[02:32:00]  The boys who are hyperactive, they put them on Ritalin.  All just fucking male traits.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all fucking true, man.  Aggressiveness and competitive nature.  Yeah.  I've heard 22-year-old girls, like, in nightclubs and shit.  I've heard this a hundred times in the last five years, yelling at some guys in a park  like, I'll kick your ass!  And they fucking believe it.  And that's a product of them being conditioned by fucking anti-mail messages over and over  again.  It's fucking relentless.  They just need a nice fucking punch right in the face.  You gotta do like that... 
[02:32:30]  Like the opening scene of that movie with Sarah Silverman, where she just gets clocked  right in the fucking face.  She wakes up and her door...  Is that way of the gun?  The door's open and she's just wedged in between it.  But it really...  It's fucking...  I mean, watch...  When you watch the Super Bowl, any Sunday, but especially the Super...  Just watch the commercials, how people are portrayed.  It's always like a bank...  It'll be a black boss with a nice suit on, and a white guy with a shitty tie, $4 shirt,  fucking messy hair.  Every white guy has a receding hairline and is an ugly fuck, and just unlikable. 
[02:33:00]  I want to know who's casting this shit.  What's wrong with that?  Huh?  What's wrong with that?  Please.  You know what gets me?  There's a commercial now that gets me, and if it was the other way around, it would  just be fucking unheard of.  It's, I think, for a bank...  WAMU, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's this black guy seems to have corralled up a load of old white guys.  Yeah.  And he's leading them around with his cleverness and trickery.  He's tricking all these old business white guys into doing his bidding. 
[02:33:30]  And I said, what if it's some old white guy and a corral of black guys?  Yeah, it would be believable.  Well, you know, it's...  Jimmy.  Who's looking at this commercial, though?  I was watching it and going, you know, that...  What the fuck?  How do you get away with that?  My buddy Joe Liss, this kid I have opened for me, he was telling me about it.  He went to a bank.  He went to his bank, and I don't know what bank it was, but there's a little thing that  says, 78% of our employees are women. 
[02:34:00]  What the fuck is that?  What does that mean?  Is that fucking good?  Is that crowing?  Why is that fucking good?  Or is that...  Are they more qualified than a fucking guy?  Why is that fucking good?  If they're telling you, chances are all you tell is going to be a cunt.  You pay yourself.  And don't expect the change to be counted properly.  Expect an error.  And she's probably on her fucking rag, so she's going to be irrational.  Exactly.  Don't put the money in your mouth.  They're going for the nurturing angle.  She's just balancing a fucking toilet paper budget at home. 
[02:34:30]  Give her a break.  It's somebody's agenda, man.  Did you ever hit a chick?  Yeah.  It's somebody's fucking...  What?  Did you ever hit a chick?  Never.  Ever in your life?  No.  Never?  Ever shook her?  I tackled a girl over a couch.  Like a fucking harmless thing.  What'd you do?  I said I tackled a girl.  This girl, Michelle, that I dated.  She was like 12 years older than me.  She put me through the ringer.  Fucking...  No, it was no fucking...  I've never ever even slapped a girl.  You've never slapped a chick?  No. 
[02:35:00]  You goon armor girl if you have to.  Goon hand.  Goon hand.  There's better ways of hurting them emotionally.  Absolutely.  Than fucking...  You don't need to hit them.  No, you can just fuck them up with words.  That's all.  Just come in and put your middle finger on the nose and go,  Hey, that's your best friend's answer.  That'll fucking cripple her for life.  Everyone's a Hannibal Lecter when it comes to the...  You can just, with words, make them fucking kill themselves like multiple meats.  You fuck another girl, and then you fuck your girl before you clean your dick off.  Just really straight. 
[02:35:30]  It's called fixing her wagon.  If there's, like, this agenda, whose is it?  I'm not going to say.  You heard Bobby Fischer.  It's a conspiracy.  I know, but where...  Yeah, right?  Where did it...  Like, how does everyone know it's just a wink and a nod that this is what we're going to do?  This is the course we're going to pursue without some secret society meeting at this huge 100 million person arena.  Colin Quinn is a great theory on that, because I do say it's a conspiracy, but it's so... 
[02:36:00]  He says it's not.  It's so ingrained, and they have people believing it doesn't have to be a conspiracy.  It's just accepted.  It just grew into it.  Yes.  It evolved somehow from...  Yeah, well, I think it's still six guys making phone calls.  Let's make the Gentile guy look like the asshole.  I'm not saying anything.  It went from, you know, the 50s, leave it to beaver kind of Ward Cleaver was the fucking man in charge.  Father knows best.  Would they ever say that today in a fucking million years?  Father knows best. 
[02:36:30]  No way.  That would be sexist fucking date misogynist.  You're saying the father knows better than the wife?  How dare you?  How dare you?  She's college educated, and there's...  All right.  Sorry.  When's the last time?  I ask this on stage a lot.  I always say, I go, when's the last time a fictional character, woman, was portrayed as angry, stupid, mean, or just unlikable?  Fucking all the family?  No, no, she was likable.  Yeah, exactly.  Somebody always goes, Suzanne Somers was...  I go, thank you for proving my fucking point. 
[02:37:00]  1975.  75.  A ditzy blonde.  Thank you.  When's the last time you had a bride who was unlikable, a fictional character, just had negative qualities?  And just not empowered kind of a thing?  Yes.  Because you could say, like, Roseanne was very negative, but she had the...  But she had the balls.  But she had the juice in the family, you know?  And she was funny.  Yeah.  But seriously, it's fucking...  Yeah, it's like Suzanne Somers, all the little fucking titty things from the 70s.  And then you're just...  Nah.  It's all empowered, strong.  I mean, if I see one more fucking movie where, like, Meg Ryan's beating up six Navy SEALs, 
[02:37:30]  I'm going to...  Yeah, who needs that?  What the fuck?  Seriously, I can't get past...  There's no reality in it.  Remember when there used to be sex objects in films?  Yeah.  They don't have any of that?  No gratuitous shots of boobs and ass anymore?  There's another thing that gets me, and I've talked about this on the air.  I watch Discovery Channel, I like the Military Channel, and when they do interviews with pilots,  love it.  Yeah.  Black, white, the same thing.  Right.  These guys are by the fucking book, and I love...  You watch a movie with a black guy as a fighter pilot, and it's like, 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, missile away, motherfucker!  Yeah.  Yeah!  I'm bringing that guy down and shit!  It's like, that doesn't sound like any pilot I've heard interviewed on any fucking channel.  310 to Yuma?  Did you see 310 to Yuma?  Yeah.  The Western?  Yep.  Right at the beginning, Russell Crowe...  Not Russell Crowe.  Who's the fucking other guy?  The other guy, yeah.  His name's Christian Bale.  Who's the other?  Christian Bale.  Yeah, Christian Bale.  His wife's...  We make decisions together. 
[02:38:30]  That's not how fucking women talked in 1850 with their husband.  Back then?  Really?  And I'm not saying...  I know you're going...  He's a reactionary.  That's how he wants it.  Fucking maybe.  But the fucking little kid is being real snotty to his father, Christian Bale.  You know...  Shit wouldn't happen.  Not back then.  The kids didn't talk to their...  No.  Painstaking detail to get the fucking outfits right from 1850, but they have the kid talking  like he was born in 1986, and I can't get past it.  I want to enjoy this fucking movie, but there's a liberal streak. 
[02:39:00]  It's...  I just saw that one, Into the Wild, that Sean Penn directed.  Oh, Christ.  And just fucking...  Anything he does.  I mean, I would have loved it, but I can't get past the fucking message behind it.  That capitalism's fucking bad.  It fucking...  It had the mother and father who didn't treat the kid good.  They were all about money and material things.  Yeah.  I mean, there's some truth, but I can't get fucking past it.  It's just...  It's like watching propaganda.  And I still enjoyed... 
[02:39:30]  As bad as the message was, I still enjoyed some of the fucking movie.  It was that good a story, but I can't...  I can't...  That's a great observation.  There are things...  There are just things going on.  There are things going on.  I like the six guys on the phone theory.  But I can't...  You know, it's fine.  And people don't have time, because people are working.  They have families, 50 hours...  You know, comics.  We have time to fucking...  You have to mull this over.  Yes.  And my sisters think I'm crazy and shit, but now they're coming around. 
[02:40:00]  You probably got them.  You know, I call up and I go, look at the fucking white guy in this commercial.  Seriously.  If you point it out enough, like you said, you'll either...  They'll leave you, or they'll start coming around.  Yeah.  You got a criticism I got from my girlfriend.  She's like, it's really hard to be around someone who's raging all the time at people.  And I'm like, I guess I am.  Oh, yeah.  Because it's like, it's always that, just that, it won't go.  It's like that, look at, I hope we get fucking canned. 
[02:40:30]  And she's like, I get it.  We're eating.  We're trying to enjoy ourselves.  Wow.  We should hang out with my wife.  She'll still have a lot to talk about.  He broke his car horn one day.  He was smashed.  He was just in traffic.  In New York.  Like, that never happens.  There's never traffic in New York.  And he's just smashing his horn with his little fist.  Fucking move!  And it just broke.  Gets so pissed.  Oh, he had nothing.  He had to yell his head out the window.  Hey, Jerry.  Hey, I just want to say that I completely agree with Nick DiPaolo.  And I do the same exact thing. 
[02:41:00]  I watch these movies and I can't, I can't pass the fact that these liberals are trying to get their messages by.  But I also want to say, if you notice on these comedian shows, these comic series,  you always notice that the guy is just a stupid dad.  And then the mom is just the smart cunt in every single comedian show.  Yeah, like a comedian show.  Everybody loves Raymond.  Ricky.  Yeah.  He invented the comedy show.  I love that.  Whereas one of the greatest ever, the guys were strong and awful. 
[02:41:30]  Like in all the family, Archie, I mean, he loved Edith, it was obvious, but she was a fucking dope.  I mean, Louie was a brutal guy, even when she wasn't married, in taxi.  So it's like where the fucking shows have been the greatest, even though the Honeymooners used that formula of her being the strong, bright one,  but they didn't do it to be fashionable.  They did it because that was the funny way to go on that show.  Yeah, but he was going to punch her in every episode.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Threatening physical violence on her.  The fucking mother-in-law.  How he just used a rag on the mother-in-law.  But people would go back then and go, obviously, he's not going to hit his wife. 
[02:42:00]  Today, it's been drilled into the head that every guy's a potential rapist.  His fucking wife beat him.  Watching this type of violence only makes people beat their, what does it?  Well, do you notice in the Honeymooners movie that they remade, The Black Honeymooners,  he didn't threaten to hit her because it wasn't politically correct.  Because that's not good.  Of course not.  Why would they?  I'd like to think that after, you know, the Honeymooners episode is over,  that there's a lot of beating going on behind closed doors.  Just pounding her in the face.  That's how I like to look at it.  They just didn't want to show that part of the sitcom. 
[02:42:30]  Her chain to the sink in the bathroom.  When he would just wave his fist and go,  You dirty old kid.  It was great.  He's going to punch you.  This is great.  Yeah.  But I got a fucking guy like,  All right, yeah.  I do my radio show and we're talking about sitcom and the guy goes,  The guy actually said, one of my listeners,  Two and a half men is kind of edgy.  What?  Fucking.  Just stop.  Ouch.  I go, see, you proved my point.  You've been fucking, they've done it to you.  Yeah.  You're on their side now. 
[02:43:00]  Brainwash.  You cut your balls off.  You fell asleep next to the bean pod and woke up.  It's kind of, yeah.  And everything's fucking funny now.  It's not.  What, because they do a prostitution joke that makes it fucking,  Yeah.  I got in trouble and this is true.  I had a meeting with NBC.  I had a bunch of,  That's when I had a deal with Dennis Larry's company.  We met with all the networks.  And every fucking, by the way,  There's no men in any of the meetings except for one.  And he was just like blatantly guy getting.  Yeah.  But every, every time, every meeting,  The first question was,  So what's the relationship party show? 
[02:43:30]  So what's your wife going to do?  And I, and I said, it's not, there's no way.  It's like Barney Miller, but I'm a single cop.  And they fucking, we'll get all quiet and shit.  And on the last meeting, I go,  They go, so how do you see the relationship party show?  I go in the pilot.  I, uh, I'm going to push my pregnant wife down the stairs.  Just trying to make a fucking,  Not even Dennis laughed or anybody.  Fucking, and everybody get quiet and shit.  And Jim Serba go, Dennis's part.  And set the lady roses the next day from NBC.  Oh my God. 
[02:44:00]  Are you kidding me?  I swear to fucking God.  That's hysterical.  It got all fucking quiet and shit.  I was hoping somebody would giggle.  They're supposed to understand comedy.  Jesus Christ.  I can't make my pregnant wife down the stairs.  I think that's actually funny.  On the pilot.  If you're meant to do it.  On the pilot episode.  Jimmy only finds it funny.  You're like W.C. Field.  W.C. Field said that's the difference between a comedian and just a regular person.  To make a regular person laugh, you know, you dress a person up like an old lady.  Push them down the stairs.  To make a comedian laugh, you actually push your old lady down the stairs. 
[02:44:30]  Push your old lady.  That's good.  Hey, this is Nick DiPaolo.  If you're interested in seeing me live, go to NickDip.com.  That's one word.  NickDip.com to get all your Nick DiPaolo touring information.  And maybe buy a stupid hat and a shot glass.  It's the worst.  Worst.  Of the O.B. and Anthony's show.  It's the best.  Boo!  The best.  Of the worst.  Of the comedian.  Of the O.B. and Anthony's show.  Just hilarious.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny. 
[02:45:00]  Really awful, too, by the way.  I'll acknowledge that.  Holy mother of God.  Now presenting comedian...  Jim Jeffries.  Hey, Jim Jeffries.  Did you tell them the story about your girl when the house got broken into?  You know what I said?  Yeah, yeah.  We told that last time, didn't we?  It's worth...  You know what?  We have a lot of new listeners since the last time you were here.  I wouldn't mind hearing that story again.  It's quite horrific.  I can't even remember what the jokes were in it, but I...  What did I tell you earlier?  Sometimes it's about just telling an interesting story.  I was...  We're getting a tidbit out there.  I was at home in Manchester with me, mate, watching a movie, and my girlfriend was next 
[02:45:30]  door, asleep in the bedroom.  Me and my mate were stoned watching The Unforgiven, I think.  And at four in the morning, two guys came through the window, one with a machete and one  with a hammer.  And they tied me up, and there's a scar there on the side of my head where they cut my  head, and they put a shoe bag over my face, and all the blood rushed out into the front  of the bag, and then they threatened to rape my girlfriend while I was tied up on 
[02:46:00]  the ground.  And it was good.  I got a good lot of material out of it.  This is the weird thing, right?  So they got me on the ground.  I got these pictures and stuff on my chest of drawers of all my nephews and nieces, and  the nice one out of the two, right?  He's a good guy.  The other guy was a bit of a prick.  And he pulls up a picture and goes, either of you guys have got kids.  And my mate Steve's on the ground like this, and he goes,  I got a five-year-old boy, like that, right?  So I think, fucking hell, you don't have kids.  They're going to fucking kill me now, right?  They're going to fucking kill me.  So I go, I got a four-year-old girl, right? 
[02:46:30]  And my mate tries to top me by going, my one's retarded.  That's fucking hell.  You're not going to kill the guy with the retarded kid.  He needs all the loving.  Yeah, that retarded kid needs all the help that you get.  Why did they come through your window?  Were they looking for drugs?  Were you guys going to have drugs in the house?  No, they thought we were drug dealers because, being comics, we had a fair bit of cash.  I drove a nice car, and I didn't seem to go to work. 
[02:47:00]  And when I did go to work, it was for like two days.  But I didn't...  If you knocked on my door at three in the afternoon, I'd answer in my underwear eating a bowl of cereal.  And that's drug dealer behavior.  Why did you leave the window open?  Because, no, we were in the house, and it was hot.  It was the middle of summer.  It was a nice neighborhood.  Oh, God.  It was an all right neighborhood, but they came through, actually, the second story window,  the bathroom.  Why was that window left open?  Because you shit in the bathroom, and it smells bad, so you open a window.  You're batting down the hatches. 
[02:47:30]  But we were in the house.  Yeah.  Robert Kelly's acting like a girl.  Oh, God, he's doing the talk.  What is wrong with you?  What has happened here today?  What the hell, Bob?  Bobby Kelly's on PalTalk doing the talk, and it looks like he's wearing flesh panties.  Oh, my God.  It's like his cock's gone down one side.  It's like just one big flap on the side of his cock.  Oh, God.  Yeah, show us.  Show us fly's eyes. 
[02:48:00]  Kenny, cancel our bagel sandwich.  And now he's smiling.  Oh, he just held open the crack of his ass, and there was like a fucking big hair hanging out.  What is wrong with you, Bob?  Bobby's just fucking lost his mind.  I was telling a heartfelt story about my robbery, and Bobby goes, I'll put my cock between my legs  so it looks like I've got a cunt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He looked like he had a bunch.  Good job.  That was cute.  A mangina for you guys.  Yeah, thank you, Bob.  A mangina. 
[02:48:30]  That's what this show needed today.  Oh, God.  So, Jim, how did this end?  They got 12 years in prison, which they'll be out probably in six or something like that.  They pleaded innocent, even though they were wearing balaclavas in the middle of June.  Like, they were driving in my car with a whole bootload of shit.  They go, no, we weren't there.  We just found this car and got in it.  Yeah.  And they went to one of them.  They go, why are you wearing balaclavas?  And he's like, it's me style.  That was his excuse. 
[02:49:00]  My mate Steve, this is the line he said.  This is what happened, right?  My mate Steve used to be the drummer for Pi Mortal, and he was the relief drummer for Faith No More when they came out to Australia.  So, he's like a heavy metal guy, right?  And they came through the window, and he said to me, he goes, look, I think you've chosen the wrong house.  All I have in this house are 20,000 heavy metal records, and I assume you like hip-hop.  Right?  It was just the most...  Oh, shit.  That didn't help the situation at all.  Nah, I can imagine it wouldn't.  Did they leave the girl alone?  I don't remember. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, they held a knife to the throat and threatened to rape her a few times, and then they didn't.  But the funny thing was, when I was getting tied up, I thought to myself, I thought, fuck, they're going to tie everyone up.  So, while they were doing it, I kept on acting like it was hurting my wrists, so that they'd do it loosely.  So that when they tied everyone up, I could escape and do some ninja shit and sort everything out.  But then they just held me hostage, so they didn't tie anyone else up.  So, but she was all right.  But I was tied up with the fucking cord from my girlfriend's hair straighteners. 
[02:50:00]  The power cord, right?  And when they left, my mate went and got a knife and cut me free.  And the girl, she didn't cry when they had a machete to her throat, said they were going to rape her.  But then I turn around, she's holding up the power cord, just bawling her eyes out, going, going, you're going to only buy this brand in America.  When am I going to America again?  I can't even fucking get them like this.  Wow.  Are you crying about your hair straighteners?  I'm still bleeding from the head.  Holy shit.  She's the one who left me.  Was this England or Australia?  This is England. 
[02:50:30]  This is Manchester.  Yeah.  Jim, this is Anthony's worst nightmare, you know.  I am.  This is why Anthony has all his guns.  A nut, well, I exercised my Second Amendment right again yesterday, by the way.  I have a brand new weapon.  What is it?  Very happy.  I have a Sig P220, 45 caliber pistol.  Oh shit, he's going to be carrying it.  That is a beautiful little weapon.  But what's the use of having it? 
[02:51:00]  In my situation, even if I had a gun, they just came through the door, bang, knife.  Uh-huh.  Would you carry it with you all the time?  Yes, exactly.  You carry it with you all the fucking time.  That's what you do.  Around your house, you're rocking around with a gun.  Why wouldn't you walk around with a gun on you in your house?  I get so depressed.  If I had a gun with me all the time, I would have killed myself 50 times already.  Just at the lowest moment, I would just go boom.  Would you really?  I really would be dead now if I owned a gun.  Well, then you're probably sitting on one.  You know, I'm not a cutter or anything, but I could definitely go a bullet. 
[02:51:30]  Really?  Oh!  Yesterday, at about 2 o'clock, feeling a bit down.  Oh, God.  Oh, I'm feeling a bit down here.  You couldn't decide what I wanted for lunch.  It would have been all over.  No, I really would be dead if I owned a gun.  Really?  Yeah, not a shadow of a doubt.  If I owned a gun, if I had a gun with me at any time, I'd be dead or would have killed  a couple of people in a race.  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah, then you shouldn't have a gun.  That's why I think it's bad.  It's bad to have guns.  No, it's good to have guns.  Anthony, you don't think you're taunting lunatics right now?  I'm not taunting lunatics.  What are they going to do? 
[02:52:00]  If a lunatic's a lunatic, he's going to do something bad.  I'm not taunting anybody.  But aren't the statistics because you have gun crime or people?  I am a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association.  You're a gun-carrying member of the National Rifle Association.  Yeah, I'm a gun-carrying member.  Do you have a gun on you right now?  No.  Then what's your policy and carry it with you all the time?  He just got it.  I have Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah, but he has other guns.  That's not his first.  He's like fucking Elvis.  He's got other guns.  I have Club Soda Kenny.  I went through...  He's my security guy.  I got a tour of Anthony's house about two or three weeks ago. 
[02:52:30]  I was amazed.  I lost count.  What did I say?  It's like Billy out of...  I think I lost count at around eight.  I like guns.  They're fun.  Eight guns in his house.  How was his house?  That's the gun I just got.  Guns and TVs.  Guns and flat screens.  That's what Ann asked.  Have you ever held a gun up to a person?  Mm-mm.  In rage?  No.  For fun he has, though.  No.  Have you ever played around in bed with it?  No, no.  Never played in bed.  Have you ever taken my guns in bed?  I've cleaned my guns in bed. 
[02:53:00]  That was just before my girlfriend left me.  Wow.  I hope you don't shoot your guns in real life like you do in Call of Duty 4 because you stink.  All right, smartass.  I know.  I stink at that game.  Have you ever wanked with a gun in your mouth?  Mm.  No.  Cock.  But never a gun.  No.  That's the gun.  No.  I don't find guns, uh, you know, like that.  But you just looked at that gun and said, isn't it sexy?  It's a pretty gun.  Isn't it a pretty gun? 
[02:53:30]  Look at it.  Doesn't that look like something you just want to have on you all the time?  That's what you got?  Yeah.  That looks cool.  The handle is cool.  Isn't that cool?  It looks like it's a fun thing to hold.  Yeah, it is.  It's very good.  Can you bring it in and we all get to hold it?  There's just something that...  No, I can't bring it in.  How many bullets does that thing hold?  How many can you chuck out?  Uh, you put about eight in there.  Yeah.  What are you allowed to do?  Are you allowed to take it out of the house?  No.  Yeah.  What's the law?  When are you allowed to shoot a person?  It's a...  Uh, there's, um...  Uh, you have to be in danger of your life or you have to feel like you're in danger of 
[02:54:00]  your life being taken.  So I could have shot those guys in my house.  Or political disagreement.  Yes.  Uh, yeah, you absolutely could have shot those guys in your house.  See, the thing is, if I shot someone in my house in England in that situation, I'd be  in prison right now.  There's deadly physical force laws.  No, you can't.  It doesn't matter.  Really?  Are you shitting me?  England sucks.  If you're in fucking England and people break into your house and you kill them, you're  fucked?  Yeah, you're fucked.  You're supposed to just take the shit out of fucking England. 
[02:54:30]  You gotta blow a whistle.  You can...  You can...  You can restrain them until the cops get there with their batons.  It's just a stupid...  The cop is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard.  But the cops really have guns in England, right?  Some of them do.  Yeah, I always find it weird.  The bobbies don't know.  They've got their weird hats and that's...  Oh my god, I couldn't imagine that.  No, you just need a gun on you.  Somebody broke into my hotel room one time and I was sleeping.  If I had shot him...  Where?  Tempe. 
[02:55:00]  That sounds justifiable.  Right?  Jeff?  Yeah.  What?  What happened to Jeffrey Ross now?  Jeff had a knife pulled on him on stage, didn't you?  Oh yeah, that's true, Bobby.  That's true.  I was actually in Brooklyn.  Oh yeah, that was a different time.  Oh really?  Oh yeah, Bobby, another time too.  Holy shit, I'm an instigator.  Obviously.  What happened in Tempe?  Tempe, I was at this hotel...  What's it called?  Shit.  Anyway, I'm sleeping.  I'm about...  It's a hotel.  I gotta get up for six in the morning.  A good hotel or like a shitty motel?  Nice hotel. 
[02:55:30]  Oh wow.  Second floor balcony.  So a guy climbed up.  Oh.  And there'd been like rapes and murders for a month.  Oh great.  Going out in Tempe.  That's fantastic.  That's a nice cool breeze.  And about 4.30 in the morning, I hear the door, the balcony door start to open.  Holy shit.  Oh shit.  I used to hurt it.  I'm naked.  I'm half asleep because I gotta get up in an hour for radio.  And I go, get the fuck out!  I go, get the fuck out of here!  And the guy just...  I see the hand quiver. 
[02:56:00]  The hand is now six feet from my head.  Oof.  And he goes, uh, uh, uh, security, sorry.  And I hear him fucking run.  And they caught him on video camera climbing over the wall.  Really?  Yeah.  Wait, what did he have in his hand?  A knife or a gun?  Nothing.  Oh, okay.  He's just coming to steal your cash, wasn't he?  He just wanted to...  I think he was coming to rape some chick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You were the wrong guy.  But he heard the fucking voice.  He got a chucky Jew and he called it off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It probably sounded like you were awake and fuck he didn't know. 
[02:56:30]  I should have...  Bobby, I should have played your new CD and scared him off.  Ross, I...  No, come on, it's joke.  Ross, I have the exact same story I've told a million times.  In Buffalo, but it's the guys on the street taking a nap during the day.  And I wake up because I feel a presence in the room.  And there's a black guy in a hoodie pulled down tight inches from my face.  And I just open my eyes and I just go, what are you doing here?  And I was like...  And as I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do, I'm like, holy shit, you got to be kidding me.  He got up real fast and ran. 
[02:57:00]  And there was a rapist at Lucent Buffalo at the time.  And he was checking out to see if I was a girl, I think.  And as soon as he heard the mad voice...  And what decision did he make?  Oh, you're mad.  No, you ran.  One time when I looked down at 300...  Scared the fuck out of me, though.  It is terrifying.  I can't...  I can't live on a...  I live on like a top floor now apartment in London.  I don't...  I don't live...  I wouldn't live on the ground.  I'm super careful now.  300 Mercer, when I first moved to New York, I just...  I went down to get my laundry and I was downstairs for five minutes. 
[02:57:30]  I'm pretty sure I locked the door, but it doesn't matter because he probably picked it.  And I opened the door and I walk in and there's just this crackhead in my bedroom.  And he's like quivering like a deer.  Holy crap.  And I look at him and he looks at me and it's just like we both know what's happening.  And he's like, where's Dave?  I'm supposed to play soccer with Dave.  He's out that window, you motherfucker.  And I back off and I let him run out and he takes the steps and I take the elevator and  I beat him and me and the doorman trapped him in the revolving door for 20 minutes. 
[02:58:00]  He just sat in the revolving door banging on it.  A rat trap.  Like catching a fly under a plastic cup.  So finally the cops, we drag him back in and they take him in and he's like, obviously  he had AIDS and stuff.  He was a drug addict.  And I go up back up the stairs and I find like some, a broken watch and my tape recorder  with like my act on it from the night before.  Like he just stole whatever was right there.  And then like six months later, I was in Union Square and I saw him just peeling through  the intersections.  Like they eventually let him out. 
[02:58:30]  I never pressed charges.  I don't think.  And then he just ran.  I saw him robbing somebody else.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Monsters.  They're just going to squash them.  There's monsters out there.  Monsters.  Did you hear this, Jim Jefferies?  I know.  There's monsters out there.  Ants well armed.  Maybe they got it right in England.  They'll have to worry about it as a fucking scout master.  A machete?  No, that's a straight.  Please, I'll whack off for 10 minutes.  I tell you what, the crime in Australia is very low for things like house burglary and  stuff like that.  Yeah.  But it's much worse in Britain.  Hey, you're listening to Opie and Anthony and if you're not listening to him, you might 
[02:59:00]  be deaf or retarded and just have the radio on and just be looking at it, staring and  nothing's really computing in.  But you wouldn't be offended by this.  You can't hear me either.  Opie and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian Jamie Kennedy.  Yeah, let's get right back into this.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  In studio, Jamie Kennedy.  You got a new movie out called The Heckler.  Yeah.  Now we got to make believe we didn't talk to you for the last five minutes.  Our boy Roland gave us copies of The Heckler and Jimmy and I really, really enjoyed it. 
[02:59:30]  First of all, I want to thank you for watching it because you know how many times you give  stuff to people and they don't watch it.  You guys actually watched it and you liked it.  That's awesome.  Thank you.  You always tell them the first question is, so tell us about it.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, there's other stuff that they give us in advance and then we're stuck because we  already booked the guest.  And we're like, so tell us about, yeah, like Jimmy just said, what am I, why am I doing  the same exact joke?  I'm an idiot.  What an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, by the way, real quick, Boogie Nights.  You said you were in, I just heard you were in Boogie Nights and they deleted your scenes?  No, here's what's happened.  I actually got a part in Boogie Nights and I got a part in As Good As It Gets.  I don't know if you saw As Good As It Gets.  That's my part.  I had actually a big part, but it got cut down to one word where I say, yo, and then  I beat up Greg Kinney and I hit him with the lamp.  Really?  Yeah.  And he was the gay guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  And then Boogie Nights, I had the actual part of the guy that has sex with Heather Graham  in the back of a limo. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And then Boogie Nights kicks me with a roller skate.  And they conflicted.  So I had to pick a choice.  It was like two months of a movie in New York or two days on Boogie Nights and I ended up  so I chose As Good As It Gets.  I ended up saying yo, but in the other one it would have been cool to have been kicked  me with a roller skate by Burt Reynolds.  That was the douchey guy that she went to school with or something?  That would have been you.  You know what's weird?  Okay, so check it out.  So I get the part.  I couldn't do it.  My roommate, the time I'm living with, I say, you should go in.  He goes in.  He gets it. 
[03:01:00]  Isn't that weird?  Oh, that was him.  That's him.  That keeps you up at night, I'm thinking.  That was a huge movie.  I know.  I'm sorry, but that's got to keep you up at night.  A Nicholson scene.  A Nicholson movie.  A Nicholson scene was good too, too.  But you know what?  Good choice by you, of course.  Going with As Good As It Gets.  Yeah, because Burt Reynolds hated that movie.  He didn't know how great Boogie Nights was, I think, until it was finished and actually  fired his agent.  Did he really?  Yeah, I was with his agent, too.  And he fired him and he said, I can't, you put me in porn. 
[03:01:30]  And then he got nominated.  Yeah.  And then.  Bring his agent back?  You put me in porn.  No, I think he went back and did an evening shade of Best Of.  So, you want to describe the heckler before we get into this?  Sure, yeah.  Just to give the overview.  Heckler, the movie's all about, like, basically it deals with the world of heckling.  And it starts with stand-up and then it goes into sports, touches on politics, and then  it kind of goes into the world of criticism. 
[03:02:00]  And then it kind of goes into the world of blogging and then the internet.  And then just kind of how the world is.  We live in such a critical place.  Now everyone has an opinion.  And it's kind of like, boom.  And now you have to see him.  Yeah.  And you have to be exposed to the criticism of people that really shouldn't be critics.  You shouldn't mind.  Yeah.  It's just someone's opinion.  But now it becomes this thing that's out there.  It's a documentary, but really it's a comedy. 
[03:02:30]  But it's all about, you know, anybody has the power to say stuff now from anywhere.  And it's just like, heckling the comedy club used to be considered like the worst.  But it's not.  It's like the best of it now.  It's like the worst is like the, you know, anonymous blogger sitting in his basement in  Dubuque and, you know, saying the worst stuff.  So that's kind of what it is.  And it's about me interviewing these people, seeing what makes them tech, talking to other  comedians, performers, actors.  Yeah.  You confront some of your hecklers.  And I think going into it, you're thinking, I can handle this. 
[03:03:00]  I'm going to sit these guys down and then see what they're all about.  And then by the end of it, you're wishing like stomach cancer on them and stuff.  Yeah.  And there was one scene, too, where he's with a heckler.  And I just, I wanted to wring this guy's neck because you're talking to him about a joke  about Christ or whatever.  And he's like, well, you want to get into it or something like that guy?  You almost had a physical confrontation with it.  Yes.  Did you?  What happened?  He just talked.  I was doing a show in like West Virginia at a college.  And he said, you know, what's that joke about Jesus? 
[03:03:30]  You know, I did this joke called like, you know, because priests are talking about the  body of Christ and they can get you to eat anything.  I'm like, they could just be like the nipple of Christ and we would just suck on it because,  you know, it's through God.  Right.  And he's like, you can't say that.  That's against religion.  And I go, it's called the nipple of Christ, bro.  It's a joke.  He goes, you want to do something about this?  Yeah.  And then we ended up like getting in like a little tiff and like my assistant was there.  Amazing.  It was really good, man, because it covers the anger performers have at hecklers because  it's almost like it's weird. 
[03:04:00]  Like when you're on stage, you kind of have to make a quick judgment as to what the guy's  intent is because most of them are douches.  But there are people that have just had too much to drink and are really just trying to  be fun with you.  But you know, it's in the eyes when somebody heckles you and you know that they're jealous  and they're going to rip you down.  They're being, you know what they're doing.  And sometimes you attack them too harshly.  Yeah.  The whole crowd who doesn't do this every night, doesn't see their face, doesn't understand  I had to crucify that guy.  Yeah.  He's garbage.  You don't get it.  And they turn on you.  And there's so many weird things with hecklers.  Yeah.  It's a fascinating thing because it's like you, most of them want to help. 
[03:04:30]  And you know, Jim will tell you, a lot of them are chicks.  We talk about that, how they get drunk and they want to help.  And it's just like, if you're saying like, you ever get belly button lint and someone's  like, yeah, belly button lint.  And you're like, can I finish my thing?  Yeah, finish it, dude.  And they just want to help.  So you don't really want to go after them.  But there are, it was one and I didn't get on camera.  It was in Canada.  And I really can't talk about it because, you know, it's a lot of graphic.  But it was a big Jamaican dude. 
[03:05:00]  And he had this white girlfriend.  And I was talking crap about Canada.  And I like to give him a little stick and a puck.  And they're happy for the rest of their lives.  And he's like, screw you, man.  You don't know about Canada.  And I'm like, dude, you're from Jamaica.  Shut up.  Like, he came after me physically.  And then they had to stop him.  And it was amazing.  Like, this is the only time a guy actually physically wanted to get me.  But really, we're talking about in the movie about how heckling is not as bad as like blogging  and criticism.  And how it's really about criticize the piece, not the person.  Yeah, I like how you have a lot of examples of comedians getting heckled. 
[03:05:30]  And some guys could handle it because they got some stuff they got in their head.  And they're well prepared for the heckler.  And then other guys just lose their mind like Guitar Dude.  Guitar Dude takes his guitar.  He's a legend, that guy.  And unfortunately, it's not on camera because it was just like it was a still shot of the stage.  But he walked off camera to take his guitar and smash it over a heckler's head.  And then he puts the pick back in the thing.  Yeah.  He puts the pick back in the guitar.  And then he thought the whole crowd was going to appreciate what he just did. 
[03:06:00]  And they're like, whoa, dude, what's up?  You know, because everyone was hating this heckler.  But his reaction was such that the whole crowd, like Jimmy was kind of saying, turned on the dude.  And he's like, what, too much?  And they're like, yeah, kind of.  And then all of a sudden, the guy said something like, all right, show over.  And just walked off stage.  Yeah.  That guy struck a blow for all.  There's not a comedian alive that wouldn't pay that guy's rent for him.  Yeah.  He struck a blow for all of us because you really learn.  It's like sometimes they heckle you because they just like there was a woman in the documentary who was just it's like the literal heckler where you say something and they feel the need to correct you because these dummies understand that humor is an exaggeration unless it's relating to them. 
[03:06:30]  So the really funny one with this British woman, he's talking about British woman.  And she's like, we don't all talk like that in England.  Only the queen does.  He's like, what, did you bang everybody in England?  He really smashed.  Yeah.  And she had to laugh because she knew she had got got, as they say.  But sometimes they just try to correct you on the facts.  They just want to shut your mouth.  I thought what was brilliant, and we're going to try not to do the whole movie for you here, Jamie, but there was a heckler in the front row in one of your shows. 
[03:07:00]  Obviously, you thought about this heckle thing for a while because you have a lot of footage of hecklers going after you.  One guy in the front row is heckling you, and you're like, all right, hey, let's see what you can do.  And you force the guy to go on stage, and then Jamie is now in the front row with his legs up on the table going, boo, and just like heckling the crap out of the guy.  And the guy literally wants to crap his pants.  He's like freaking out up there because he really thought he could go up there and maybe get a reaction on the crowd. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  I thought that was brilliant, too.  And even the critics that defended themselves and stuck by it and go, yeah, your movie was terrible, if a critic doesn't like a film, that's fine.  But just being face-to-face with these guys, they're all nerds.  All of them are nerds.  The one guy with that little bump on the side of his stupid nose where you were just, let's just say, talking about the sloppy, just say, oral treats.  He was so uncomfortable with you talking about sex like that. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That guy from the Tribune or wherever you are.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A little tool.  It's funny, you know.  It's true.  It's like, I hate to categorize people, but he's right.  It's like they are all nerds.  I needed to do this movie for my soul.  Like, I started doing my stand-up right, and I was going to do a little special for Comedy Central.  And they're like, go out on the road for six months and get your tight 45 or whatever you can do, right?  So, I started doing it, and I started filming this stuff.  And the heckling became the most coolest part of the show. 
[03:08:30]  So, that's how the movie just started.  And I started collecting, and I started talking to guys like Joe and different people getting their heckles.  And then it moved into those blogging because I started reading about my stuff.  I had a movie come out, and I just got destroyed.  And that's how the movie kind of made itself.  Right.  And I now feel so good, but what Jim says is true.  It's like you have to learn who's saying this stuff because you're reading about yourself,  and it's like, Jamie Kennedy not only sucks, he shouldn't have a career, his mother's uterus should be shut down for giving birth to him. 
[03:09:00]  You're like, whoa, what the hell?  Wait, you know, it's like...  Bastards, yeah.  Then you find out who's writing it, and then you feel better, but you have to go through the process.  But there are some people that are haters.  Like, that one guy at the end is a hater to the end.  The guy with the beard?  Oh, yes.  The guy with the beard, who is the guy who is like...  And he says he's a comedian, too, which is weirder because it's like...  The guy who is kind of smiling at you?  Yeah, very snarky.  But he looked like a Nazi.  I'm sure he wasn't, but you know what I mean?  You know if the guy...  Yeah, yeah.  You wanted to bite his face.  Oh, absolutely.  Because it was this defiance that was this phony... 
[03:09:30]  It was an over-the-top defiance, like, oh, you're going to call me out?  Well, I'll show you.  Yes.  And you know that the guy isn't a funny guy.  He looks greasy.  Yes.  You just know he's like a lonely nothing.  And he's probably not even that funny of a writer, which to me, most of them are not good writers,  which is the greatest crime they commit is not being good writers.  Yes.  You know, you can criticize what you want, but be funny with it, and they're not.  Yeah.  And I just really wanted to knock his teeth out, because it wasn't...  I don't mind a guy standing his ground and going, you know what, I didn't like your movie.  Because you are calling them out, and some of them are going, look, there was one guy 
[03:10:00]  who you call out, and you're like, why didn't you like it?  And he goes, it wasn't a good movie.  That was Richard Roper.  And you're like...  But you were very funny, because you're like, ugh.  All right.  You're like, all right.  Because they have points.  There's truth to it.  It's just that sometimes they rip you personally to the point, you're like, what did I...  And what do you think that's about?  Because it's one thing for a critic to say, yeah, you know, I didn't like your performance  in this movie, and they keep it professional.  But why do some of these people, like you said a little while ago, have to get so personal  where they wish cancer on you and death to your family? 
[03:10:30]  We had a situation when we did our dumb Sex with Sam bit, which was horrific, but they  couldn't keep within what we did.  They had to bring our parents into it and wish that our parents were tarred and feathered  and thrown in the river.  I'm like, what do they have to do with us messing up on our radio show?  Yeah.  But where does that come from, where they crossed that line, you think?  I...  It comes...  Well, if you're right...  If they're writers...  Right.  It comes from...  They're entertainers, too, basically.  They want to grab headlines. 
[03:11:00]  So, you know, if they say, Jim Norton's show is like watching herpes manifest on your  nut sack or whatever, it's like, oh, someone's going to read that.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Or Jamie Kennedy's career is worse than, you know, whatever.  So, that's number one.  Number two is, I don't...  I mean, that's really what I've noticed.  Some of them are...  If someone really rips me in a funny, creative way, I give them props.  I mean, there are times on the tape I don't do good with hecklers.  And other times I do.  I mean, sometimes they win.  You got to love them.  Right, right.  But I think sometimes it's really about... 
[03:11:30]  Patton Oswalt says it really good.  He says, there used to be a time where you'd look at people and you'd be like, oh, Gale  Sears can run good.  And now it's like, it just makes people angry.  It's like this generation of, why is Jim Norton and Opie have a radio show?  Why not me?  Right.  You know what I mean?  Right.  It's a different time.  It seems like it's that mentality of everybody's giving everybody such positive feedback.  They think they deserve it.  Patton was right about that, too.  It's like there's people who just think they should be doing it and there's a jealousy.  And you kind of know, as a performer, your instinct, you understand when someone's heckling 
[03:12:00]  you immediately why they're doing it.  Right.  Like one time I was on stage at the Comedy Cellar and there's a guy to my right and I  was doing a clean set.  I was working on a Leno set.  It was a little aggressive.  And he's like, ah, that's...  And it was something I said that wasn't gentlemanly.  And he was trying to be this knight in shining armor for his stupid family.  And I laid it to him.  It wasn't funny.  You would have thought I never did comedy in my life.  I was a dock worker.  I was like Lee J. Cobb just yelling at this snob.  And I'm like, don't use me to impress your effing wife and your effing... 
[03:12:30]  Because I knew exactly what he was doing.  He was trying to show off for his family and try to shut this punk down.  And sometimes that's what you have to do.  You've got to throw the set to walk out with your dignity.  Because you're not going to allow that guy to ruin you.  You can't do it.  Now, wait.  Were you able to recover?  Or was that it?  Did you have to end that?  Nah, I don't think so.  I think the rest of the set went poorly.  Who cared?  I made 25 bucks at the cellar.  It had to happen.  Yeah.  It had to happen.  In Heckler, Jamie Kennedy also gets to interview George Lucas. 
[03:13:00]  And we called him out on it as soon as he sat down.  Like, dude, you did not set up an interview with George Lucas.  You railroaded the guy.  You knew he was going to be somewhere.  You went with a film crew and said, hey, George.  And there's people around.  So now George doesn't want to be the a-hole.  So he's like, all right, I'll give you 30 seconds on heckling.  Wait.  You know, it's so funny because everyone's like, dude, how'd you get George Lucas?  Of course, you bust me one second.  Wait.  So you want to hear the real story?  Yeah, yeah.  I tell people that I was up for...  I was like Jar Jar Banks.  I say, well, I was Jar Jar. 
[03:13:30]  I couldn't do it.  He'll do me a favor.  So I was doing a video.  I did a comedy video with Bob Saget called Rolling with Saget.  Sure.  It was like a rap film.  Yeah, and it did very well.  It did well.  So we're doing this video, right?  And I'm filming on Hollywood Boulevard.  And this Hollywood Boulevard that day was crazy.  It was a commercial.  It was me filming something.  And there was CSI New York, right?  So I'm doing this video.  I got all these girls and stuff.  And I'm sitting there. 
[03:14:00]  And somebody goes, why is Michael McDonald on set?  And I'm like, Michael McDonald?  What?  And I look over.  And I go, that's not Michael McDonald.  That's George Lucas.  Oh, my God.  He looks like Michael McDonald, right?  So I go over.  I go, George?  He goes, hey, how are you doing?  I go, what are you doing?  He goes, I'm just here.  I'm looking at your cameras.  So George Lucas every day goes, every like Wednesday, his daughter goes to USC.  He goes and has, I shouldn't tell stalkers this.  He goes and has lunch at Mousseau and Frank's.  You know Mousseau and Frank's on Hollywood Boulevard?  It's old-time Italian food. 
[03:14:30]  He just goes and has a little bolognese and leaves, right?  So he walks on Hollywood Boulevard, and he's a big camera into cameras.  So we were using this high-tech new camera called a RED camera.  And he was like, what kind of BPM do you have?  What's your shutter speed?  And he'll just walk, right?  So he starts talking to the camera guy.  And I know George.  He's like, you know, I was like any other guy.  We had a lot of girls.  I go, hey, George, what are you doing?  And he goes, I'm just checking out the cameras.  And I go, will you be in this video?  And he goes, what?  So I had, like, we're shooting the video. 
[03:15:00]  So I actually put him in the video.  I put two girls next to him, and he lip-synced.  And then as we were there, we were filming for Heckler.  And I go, George, let me ask you a couple things about criticism.  And I got him.  And he was amazing.  But the thing is, is that he thought he was on the set of CSI New York.  He goes, is this CSI New York?  Oh, no.  And then we're like, no, it's our video.  It was what?  And he goes, you're my video, bitch.  And Saga comes over.  He's like, was Darth Vader gay?  He starts just asking the worst questions about Star Wars. 
[03:15:30]  He's like, Yoda, was he a Jew?  Come on.  It was hilarious.  I mean, George was awesome, very comedy.  What we did kind of ambush him, and he was great.  And he, so check it out.  So we signed off.  We had three quotes of him, and he said, two days ago, you can use that one.  And we used the one, and it was really cool.  And he let us put a link to StarWars.com.  You also, I like the fact that you went into the internet blogging, because it's funny,  too, and I've noticed this about myself.  We as performers are also, we are one-sided, and all of us are guilty of this. 
[03:16:00]  I've never heard a performer who got a good review go, what the hell does that guy know?  Why is he a critic?  Right, right.  Like, it's only when we get trashed.  Sure.  You know, I've been trashed.  I've never once, like, when somebody writes good things about me on a message board, I'm  like, oh, that's nice.  But when they write bad things about me, I'm like, oh, those cowards.  You know, I just, I always look at the negative.  Over and over again, you understand that most performers, you know, the whole audience could  love you except for one person, and that's one person that's going to bother you for the 
[03:16:30]  rest of the night.  Isn't that brutal?  Why is that?  Isn't that brutal?  And a fan site could do the same thing, 90% positive stuff, but one lousy dude could ruin  your day.  You know, and the cure to that is to just stop reading all that stuff.  Yeah, I mean, you look at it, and you're like, you have to learn.  I think this was a real cathartic process for me, and you have to learn about who's writing  it and why, but when you're reading it, and they're writing like, you know, not only do 
[03:17:00]  you suck, but it's like, you shouldn't have a career.  You're ugly.  You're this.  You're like, whoa.  And if you do read it, and you start going, oh, my God.  People don't think it affects them, but, you know, Robert De Niro, there's a lot of cool  people that weren't in this movie that I tried to get, and Phil Jackson told me an amazing  story, and he's like, I'll never be in your movie, but I love that you're doing it.  I go, why?  He goes, because you're giving them power.  And he's like, and he told me an amazing story of how this one guy would bring the  hottest girls, he's a famous basketball heckler, to the opposing bench, and the girls 
[03:17:30]  would say real personal stuff about the guy, because they would know stuff, and they would  freak the guy out.  And so, like, there's that, and there's, like, Robert De Niro, I know, I've seen an interview  that says, I don't read my reviews.  He doesn't want to know what people are saying.  And that's Robert De Niro.  You know what I mean?  So it's a fascinating world.  Absolutely.  I don't think you are empowering them, though.  I really don't, because everyone knows they exist.  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  I mean, they're in the USA today.  They're in every major newspaper, so I don't think all of a sudden you're taking these obscure  figures.  They are empowered to a certain degree, and I like the fact that it's like cockroaches.  You're shining a light on them.  Yeah.  I like.  And look, what's his name?  How do you say, Uwe or Uwe?  Uwe.  Uwe.  Uwe.  He's coming on.  Yeah, we can't wait to talk to this guy.  He's the man.  He's a German director.  Have you ever had him before?  No.  Uwe.  He seems like he's nuts.  No, Uwe is an intense dude.  He's German.  Yeah, we can't wait to talk to this guy. 
[03:18:30]  He works out.  And he fights people all the time.  He has a petition right now.  He says, if you want me to direct him more, I'd sign a thousand signatures.  So for your movie, he fights critics.  Yeah.  He has.  That was like the most amazing part of the movie, by the way.  That they would, these critics would actually, because they all want their attention, so  of course they're going to agree to it.  Well, that's.  I could be in a movie about, you know, hecklers and critics.  Did they know they were going to be in the movie or no?  Well, it's a couple of things.  It's like, number one is, to your point is that, now, how everyone, like what you're 
[03:19:00]  saying is, my whole thing is, if someone has a paper and it's, you know, the East Texas  Christian Daly, and it's 70,000 circulation, and he writes, you know, Jamie Kennedy's movie  sucks, whatever.  My whole thing is, if you know something about my movie, before you trash it, know what you're  talking about, because if not, there's 70,000 people just, I've lost, number one on the  business.  Number two is, all those guys, they agreed to fight him, and, I mean, he's a tough dude.  They definitely, it's like a reality show contestant.  Like, when I did my old show, Jamie Kennedy experiment, and we put people through crazy 
[03:19:30]  stuff, and they'd still sign, because they want to be on TV.  We all want to be famous.  Yeah.  So, they did sign, and he ended up fighting for five guys and beating them all.  It's in a row, right?  Yeah, five in a row.  It's an amazing scene, because you see the critic and what he said about this guy's, you  know, film, or his work, whatever, and then the next scene is this guy in the ring getting  his ass at it.  And it was so well, one after another, I was, that was an amazing, amazing part of the movie.  They would show the guy talk. 
[03:20:00]  The guy would say, like, they showed them all.  All tough, too.  Like, you know, the nerd behind his keyboard.  Like, ah, you know, whatever.  Whatever it would be.  That one goth guy.  Right.  And then they show the guy, he got beat up so bad, he's on all fours puking.  That was the greatest.  Oh, my God.  That's how Zapruder must have felt when he shot the assassin.  To see that guy vomiting.  Yeah.  That critic who was punched in the stomach, vomiting.  Yeah, all cocky behind his keyboard, and, you know, next scene, he's in the ring with  this animal.  He's getting his ass handed to him.  Yeah, they had no idea.  I mean, it was cool that they showed up, but they got beat. 
[03:20:30]  And as a side note, I tried to add, I met Billy Burr, and I tried to use that footage.  All right, because that's coming in like crazy.  You know about that, I'm sure.  But the footage doesn't, it doesn't, it's so hard to, it doesn't look.  His puddle of AIDS.  It's real, well.  It's the rest.  Of course, Bill Burr taking on 10,000 hecklers.  I saw Bill at the comedy store, and he's like, you should use it.  And I'm like, okay.  And I tried to use this footage, and it doesn't look, it's very hard to see.  It's barely usable. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, it's too bad.  But it's an amazing story.  Too bad you couldn't have a copy from someone that actually shot it.  Yeah.  It was like shot on a cell phone.  Yeah, that thing.  But being from Philly, everything he said is true, and it was brilliant.  And it's true.  It's like the more you crap on them, the more they respect.  That thing is getting more and more popular as the movies go on.  Yeah, it was amazing.  Him just, he got heckled by a couple guys, he said, that's it.  And he just took on the entire crowd.  They are trading that video all over the place.  I think every comedian in the world has seen that now.  Yeah.  He just said, screw it. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  I'm going after these animals, and he ripped them apart.  And they loved him for it.  Not even real.  Person.  Yeah.  He got a statue of Rocky.  And then he mentioned all the black people he don't have statues of that were legitimate  boxes.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It was great.  Oh, he ran through everything.  I was amazed he knew so much about Philly.  I know.  I know.  He pounded them.  And he counted down the same time, like 11 times.  Two minutes.  Yeah.  Eight minutes left.  Billy, he was just great.  It was great to see a comedian do that.  Well, I hope we did your movie justice, because I-  You guys are amazing. 
[03:22:00]  Thank you.  Jamie and I really, really liked it.  It was very, very interesting.  Extremely interesting.  Thank you, Jamie.  Good luck.  Thanks, you guys.  Thank you so much.  All right.  We got to take a break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Jamie Kennedy.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian...  Ricky Gervais.  Let's say hi to Ricky Gervais.  Ricky!  Hello.  Did you see the Oscars last night?  I did, no.  I've heard bits and pieces of the results, but I didn't watch it, because it was very late 
[03:22:30]  here, of course.  Is that a big thing over there, or do you just could give a crap?  I mean, well, it's, you know, it's the biggest award ceremony in the world, but, you know,  that's probably not saying much.  I don't think people lose sleep if they didn't watch the Oscars.  I just know we're kind of very self-centered over here, and the Oscars is like this big  thing, and I was driving the other day, and I'm listening to the news, and they're talking  about the Oscars, and you know how it goes on for months before it even happens, and I'm  thinking, what do some other countries think that we hold this huge party for movies we 
[03:23:00]  watch?  Well, it seems a bit celebrating your time off.  Yeah, celebrating movies.  You know, essentially to fill the leisure time, because people are living too long now, and  yet we celebrate that.  It's strange, like, having a party for the day before you go on a roller coaster, then  sort of talking about it afterwards, and not only that, filming the eight hours build-up  to go in on that roller coaster.  Yeah, on a bit of entertainment.  You're then celebrating this entertainment. 
[03:23:30]  But it's, you know, you've got to count it as an art form, and art helps the human psyche  and develops our brain and our sociability, so maybe it's a good thing.  Maybe it's as important as life itself.  I kind of think of it, though, as one of the American overindulgences that we have over  here that we do, because we as Americans sometimes expect the rest of the world, like, I hear  you, and then for a second I'm thinking, oh yeah, they kind of watched the Oscars over  there, but does it even mean, like, is it that big over there?  Like, I'd expect to go over to... 
[03:24:00]  I mean, it's not the difference between being American and English, it's what you're exposed  to, because I very much doubt that, you know, academics in, you know, Harvard are sitting  down watching the Red Cardinal shows for nine hours.  Right, well, here too.  But I'd be a little, like, I'd be surprised, I'm one of these Americans that just, I'd be  surprised to go over to England on July 4th and go, where are the fireworks, you know,  because we're so used to it here. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, but everyone's a little bit like that, you know, everyone thinks that the world revolves  around them, and no more than the Americans and the British.  Right, and doesn't it really, doesn't it really, though?  Well, obviously, I think that I'm one of these people to go abroad, and I never try to speak  their language, I point, you know, or I talk a little bit louder, and if, you know, if  they can't understand me, I'm annoyed, I'm thinking, why can't they speak English? 
[03:25:00]  Speak English!  Because, you know, just to remind you, it is called English, it's not called American.  It certainly is.  Although Hollywood helped English be probably still the widest spoken language in the world.  I mean, I think that, you know, it's pretty much that and Ford made America the nation  it is.  I understand how the English feel about that, and it is English and we speak English,  but isn't it kind of like the little kid that you raised, and then it grew up to be  able to kick your ass and take the car out any time we want? 
[03:25:30]  I do think, I think that, you know, you've done very, very well, and I'm surprised, because  I didn't think you'd amount to anything.  But now I'm very, very proud of you.  Thank you.  It was all your work, all your work raising us.  You know, and this is probably why I'm bilingual, I speak American and English.  Very well.  Hey, Ricky, are you a stand-up, too, or are you just an actor?  Um, I'm, uh, I wouldn't, oh, I wouldn't even call myself an actor. 
[03:26:00]  I wouldn't, certainly wouldn't call myself a stand-up.  I don't know what I am, really.  I'm a comedian.  I'm a comedian.  There you go.  Dude, The Office, your character in The Office, I mean, like, I always thought De Niro in,  uh, The King of Comedy was the best portrayal of an ass, but that character you play,  I've, it is amazing, it's an absolute ass in The Office.  It is fucking brilliant, man.  Well, I, um, I, I love the reference to De Niro, because, you know, when, when you're  a fat bloke and you grow a goatee, you think secretly that you are going to look like De 
[03:26:30]  Niro and Angel Heart, um, it doesn't quite work that way, but, um, uh, well, thank you  very much.  This is, this is, like, a really weird question.  One of my favorite moments ever captured on film, it's in the second episode, I think,  of season one, when the girl comes to work at The Office, and the phone rings, and you,  like, you answer it and try to be funny on the phone, and you hang it up, and the phone  falls on the floor.  Do you know the, uh, yeah, the answer machine just, just showing off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, you're just trying to, he's trying to riff with the answering 
[03:27:00]  machine, and he's like a fucking ass, he knocks you on the floor, and it's the most  real, awkward comedy moment.  Was that intentional that you knocked that off, or that just kind of happened?  Oh, of course.  Well, we tried it about five times, because I actually, I wanted it to land in the bin,  and I, I can't even remember if it did in the end, but it, it got pretty close to it,  I think.  Oh, God.  Yeah, no, no, there's, there's not a lot by mistake in The Office.  It's, uh, it's 99.9% scripted, you know, everything is, uh, it's, it's rather 
[03:27:30]  like a cartoon.  I always think of that in a cartoon, that a leaf doesn't fall by mistake in a cartoon,  they've got a drawer, that leaf.  Right.  And, um, we, we, we drew everything.  Well, it was, it, it, it, I'm even more impressed that it was scripted, because that, I rewound  that, and watched it, and rewound that, and it was so fucking organic, and it was just  absolutely perfect, and I cringe, I'm like, ah!  Well, that was the idea, but that was the, that, you know, that was the challenge, really,  that we had to find performers that could make it look like it was ad-libbed, which  is, which is very strange, because we were going for the, the hyper-real, I mean, that 
[03:28:00]  the really important thing about that show was that everyone knew it was meant to be a  documentary, because it, without that, these characters were quite boring, sad people, but  when you suddenly realise that they're trying to be famous, and they're showing off, and  they're acting up, it, it, it brings the really, really important ingredient to their  characterisation, um, so, you know, we cheated less than real documentaries, um, so it had  to be hyper-real, uh, uh, because you had to spend your disbelief long enough to think, 
[03:28:30]  oh, I get it, this is a real company somewhere, this really exists.  So was the process of that, was the process of creating that, because I heard that, like,  what you would do is, like, a lot of you got together and, um, kind of talked, and the  scripts got come, uh, kind of got born of all your interaction, or was the script  created first?  No, no, no, we, we handed the actors the finished script on the, you know, on that,  they, you know, and then we'd, we'd go through it, and we'd say, oh, can you say this word  like that, you know, and then we'd take a cutaway of the face we wanted, and we'd piece 
[03:29:00]  it together, it, it, it's, it's absolutely, um, you know, probably the most contrived piece  of comedy you'll ever see.  You've had to have consulted with people that actually were in situations with these type of  people, because as you watch, um, it is a pretty accurate portrayal.  For seven years, it's, it was all, it's, it's, I, I worked in a real office like that  for seven years, um, and, uh, of course, you know, I came to it with a, a big bag of  observations, and, you know, it started out as a straightforward observation of comedy, 
[03:29:30]  plus trying to get some stuff off your chest, um, and, uh, uh, you know, other themes are  quite obvious, you know, men as boys, wasting your life, but one of my favourite themes of  The Office, which I don't think people pick up on, um, from a selfish point of view, it  was a comedy about comedy.  It was, it was, it was a comedy about bad comedy and good comedy and popularity through  comedy, and that was just something that, um, uh, that, you know, that was so close to  my heart.  I was, I'm fascinated by comedy. 
[03:30:00]  It's the only thing I'm a nerd about.  Yeah.  Um, and, um, I just wanted to nail a few things.  What do you, what do you think about the, uh, American version?  I really like it.  I really like it.  I think that, um, it was always going to be difficult for them because they were, they  weren't the original for better or worse.  I think the first one you see is the one that, you know, you, you, you like, and they  had to get over that sort of, that prejudice really.  Yeah.  Um, uh, but it's totally theirs now.  I watch it not thinking, oh, that's me. 
[03:30:30]  Right, right.  I, I, I think that they're, they're great.  I think Steve Corral is an amazing performer.  He really pulls it off.  Oh, he plays the perfect ass too.  He really does.  He's great.  But he's working so hard.  It looks so natural as well, but you can see he's working on every little detail.  He's, he's, it's, you know, it's the, he's got such finesse and it's the minutiae that  he cares about.  And, um, I've got to say well done to NBC as well, because they could have panicked because 
[03:31:00]  of the network on sort of prime time and they could have watered it down.  And, um, you know, uh, I, I'm really proud of everyone, you know, what I'm most proud  of is I'm getting money for old rope.  I haven't, I haven't seen it.  Uh, the new, the, the American version, but watching Ricky play the, the office manager  and just the trying to be funny and everybody's pal to like to paint an ass who isn't funny,  but trying to be funny.  So awkward and perfectly.  And the silence, the awkward fucking silence. 
[03:31:30]  The silence is, that's it, aren't they?  The silence is, that's what, that's what, um, is excruciating in real life.  When you've made a faux pas or joke, it's about three seconds afterwards.  You get nothing.  You wish that you could cut in real life and, and, uh, we didn't even cut in fiction.  Dude, it, it, it's like a little thing you would do at times where like, I, I can't even  describe it.  It's almost like when you crinkle your nose up, like, huh?  Like, like a little nose crinkle, like after the joke, it was trying to squeeze the thing  out of it.  Yeah. 
[03:32:00]  And those interviews where you did, like where you were just the guy talking to the camera  and just trying to be humble, but you just knew you were so self-satisfied.  Oh, what a boob.  It was just.  What he's trying to do, he's trying to show the world, you know, life didn't turn out like  he thought, but now he thinks, this is my chance.  Now the world can see what a great bloke I am.  A.  Philanthropist.  B.  C.  Leader.  You know, these are how you think.  That's fantastic.  It's just a great show.  What did, what did, what did you grow up watching that you're, you know, comedy geek, as you, 
[03:32:30]  you put it?  American stuff.  Really?  Lauren Hardy is, is, you know, comedy began and ended there.  They pretty much nailed it a hundred years ago.  I don't really think it's been improved upon really.  Styles have changed a little bit and sensibilities, but they pretty much nailed it.  The thing about Lauren Hardy is it's, it's what, you know, when I came to the office,  I wanted to sort of do comedy plus.  I didn't just want it to be funny.  I wanted it to sort of resonate and wanted to get under people's skin.  And Lauren Hardy taught me that because you cared for them. 
[03:33:00]  You didn't just laugh at them.  You, they were precarious.  You, you knew they could get hurt at any minute.  And that's what made you love them.  And, uh, it, you know, um, Marx Brothers, uh, through the, you know, um, fifties and  sixties stuff that, uh, cheers, mash, um, uh, through to modern day stuff like Arrested  Development, the Simpsons, obviously the pretty much the greatest, uh, TV comedy ever. 
[03:33:30]  Um, uh, so yeah, um, nothing much, no real English influences though, comedy wise.  I mean, obviously people would think Monty Python or something, but, uh, no, I love Monty  Python, but it wasn't really influenced because that was, you know, that was quite postmodern  and surreal and, um, uh, but you know, that's not, that's not, I love Monty Python and I  love Fawlty Towers, but it wouldn't be an influence.  I mean, I suppose the English influences would be things like, um, oh God, this is hard. 
[03:34:00]  Shows like All in the Family, which here were so popular, I think is taken from Man  About the House, which is a British show.  And then also, um.  Yeah, no, that was very, very broad.  Again, that was, there was, there was nothing to really influence me there.  Um, there's a show called, um, um, uh, Rise and Fall of Reginald Parent, which, uh, which  was very, that was on here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That, that, that, that, I suppose that would, uh, there'd be an influence there, but certainly,  you know, I went through that lineage that went through John Cleese and Monty  Python, you know, I, I acknowledged Fawlty Towers as, I think the best British sitcom 
[03:34:30]  of all time.  And, you know, it, you know, it, I suppose it influenced me on the fact that, you know,  I knew how long they crafted it and then they got out while they're on top.  So that's certainly an influence on me.  But, um, comic sensibilities are all American, really.  It would influence, uh.  Real life and American programming.  It would influence me to use video inside and film outside.  Because for some reason.  Yeah, exactly.  They always did that.  There was that.  I loved when he ran out of the place and it was obviously done on video inside the set 
[03:35:00]  and then he'd run out to his car and it's just done on film.  Like grainy old film.  It was hysterical.  Watching that on, uh, channel 13 here.  Have you found, like, I don't, I don't know enough British stand-up, but have you, it  seems like, uh, more British stuff is more absurdist and kind of, uh, you know, just like  Steve Martin-ish in that it's really ridiculous and I'm not shitting on it, it's just a different  vibe and it just seems like a lot of it isn't very socially angry.  There has been a spate where, you know, there's an awful lot of, you know, surrealism, 
[03:35:30]  flights of fancy, weird stuff like, I was born on the inside of a wasp, don't worry  madam, I'm not going to pour cheese in your eyes.  And, uh, I'm thinking, well, yeah, good, I mean, I don't know what that is.  I think that comedy has to, has to really, uh, you know, uh, connect, uh, on an empathetic  level.  I think you have to empathize with that person for, to, to care about them and comedy is  contextual and you can go out and make funny noises and fall over and it's, it's all right.  I mean, I don't even like, you know, uh, a hundred one brilliant one-liners in a sense. 
[03:36:00]  You know, you laugh, but someone could throw in a fake punchline and you'd laugh because  of the rhythm.  I want to, I want to feel that I've been touched in some way, not in a bad way.  Right.  Not, not, not like you do in a public toilet.  I don't think that's sort of touching.  That's kissing by the way.  But I feel like I want to, I want, you know, I want to have connected with that, with, uh,  the comedy in some way.  Hey, Ricky, we got to talk about your podcast.  Uh, it's one of the most downloaded things on the internet. 
[03:36:30]  In the world.  In the world.  Sorry.  In the world.  No, Ricky Jervis does a, what?  That's not saying much though, is it really?  It's the Ricky Jervis show.  It's the only podcast, for all I know, it's the only podcast in the world.  It's rather like Alexander Graham Bell boasting about his phone bill.  You know, it, it, it, I don't think there's an awful lot of competition.  Yeah.  No, there's plenty of crappy podcasts out there.  I'll tell you that.  I hear it's getting.  I've never listened to a podcast except mine.  How many downloads is that getting? 
[03:37:00]  Uh, it's, um, it's got so far 12, I think it's got over 5 million so far.  Damn.  In about 13 weeks.  I think you get the, uh, the show off audible.com, right?  And iTunes.  And iTunes.  Yeah.  How often do you do it?  Uh, once a week.  Once a week?  Once a week.  Audio or video also?  Uh, well, it's audio at the moment.  We are going to do a, uh, a video.  That's what everyone's doing now.  It's getting a video podcast.  Yeah.  I just want to show the world Carl Pilkington's head, really, because I talk about it, but 
[03:37:30]  I want, I really want to take a camera around him so you can see the, you know, the, the  360 degrees, the, the spherical nature of his cranium is, is quite beautiful.  What's the podcast all about?  Like, what kind of show are you guys doing?  Well, it's, uh, um, it's three blokes in the room.  Myself, Stephen Merchant, who, uh, uh, created the, the office with me, and Carl Pilkington,  a man who is so stupid, I can't believe he's still alive.  Um, he's a man who believes everything he hears and reads, as long as it's about apes 
[03:38:00]  that can ride horses and do operations.  He doesn't really care about the real things in life.  He, he gets most of his sort of, um, um, knowledge from the Flintstones and, and, uh,  he's just a fascinating man to throw stuff at.  He's, uh, I feel like, uh, you know, Anthony Hopkins in the, the elephant man, I, I feel  like I want to take him round and just show the world this eighth wonder. 
[03:38:30]  Um, so it's, it's, it's all about that, really.  But you don't want to hurt him, kind of.  You want to protect him and show him off at the same time like Hopkins did.  I don't want to hurt him.  Um, I, I want to, you know, I sort of want to squeeze him like you, you know, like you  want to squeeze a kitten, but you know, you mustn't squeeze too hard.  That's how I feel about Carl Pilkington.  The elephant man was a good movie, by the way.  It's Carl Pilkington's favorite movie.  And I said, why?  He said, well, one, you know what you're going to get.  It says what it is on the label. 
[03:39:00]  Uh, he said, two, it's sad.  And when I said, pressured him, he said, well, there was that bit where, um, uh, he goes,  goes to the, um, the Royal College of Surgeons and he strips him off and he's going, you see  the deformation of the head, the skull, the, the, the, the back, the, the arms, the legs,  the bone structures.  Ironically, uh, the only thing that's, uh, totally normal are the genitals.  And Carl went, think of that, the one thing you would want to have like an elephant and  he gets the end. 
[03:39:30]  So, uh, that's why it's his favorite.  Hey, let's go to John in, uh, Jersey.  He's a, he's a huge fan of the podcast.  John.  Uh, yeah, Ricky, I want to say the podcast is brilliant.  Carl Pilkington, guys, you have, he has to get on to XM.  Uh, Ricky should have his own show.  Carl Pilkington, if it's an act, it's brilliant.  If it's not, he's the dumbest man in the world.  Uh, well, uh, he's like that in the pub.  So unless he's acting every minute of the day, including his dreams,  because he often wakes up and he says things like to his girlfriend, 
[03:40:00]  is the earth falling?  Um, so unless it's, you know, 24 hours a day, I don't think he's acting.  Oh, Ricky, um, if, if we have to pay for it coming up, I, I'm there.  I'm paying you.  I'm giving you money.  I know you love the money.  It's, uh, it's only, it's only, um, I think $2 because we were stitched  up because we gave it away free for the first 12 weeks and we never dreamt  we'd get like half a million downloads a week.  You get a bandwidth bill.  Yeah.  We had to start charging for it.  Not because we thought how much money we could make, 
[03:40:30]  but because of course it's costing us money.  And we didn't want to take in advertising and have a sponsor because we want  the freedom.  And, uh, this just gives us more freedom.  You know, it's, people don't have to buy it, you know, but it's, it's there.  And it's, and it's going to be even more free of burdens.  We can say anything we want.  We don't need to take advertising.  We don't need sponsorship.  And, uh, you know, we can say exactly what we want.  And I just think, um, we'd rather, we'd rather lose 90% of our listeners,  but people love it because we don't do it for the money. 
[03:41:00]  We don't do it for anything other than the, the, the sheer, uh, joy of the,  you know, the creative process.  So, um, uh, uh, please, please listen if you, if you like, and, um,  and, uh, Carl can get some money.  All right, let's go to Mike in Pennsylvania, Mike.  Hey, uh, Ricky, I'm a big fan of the, uh, podcast.  Now, are you sure you're not feeding him, you know, lines?  Cause he comes up with these things like, you know, I could eat a knob at night.  And it's just hilarious.  Uh, but that, that, that, that, it's, it, if you go back and listen, it's, it's, 
[03:41:30]  it's totally, you know, organic.  He was, the only point he was trying to make was that, uh, in this particular  program, um, they, they have to do this Bush Tucker trial as soon as they wake up.  And he was thinking that as opposed to thinking I'd never eat a kangaroo testicle  or a kangaroo penis or what he thought, oh, it's even worse at breakfast time.  And now I'll bet he's the only person who thought that no one else is going,  Oh, look, it's breakfast.  They'd go, look at that.  It's disgusting.  I'm not going to eat a testicle. 
[03:42:00]  And, um, then to go, you know, I could eat a knob at night was remarkable.  Um, uh, so we just, we said, right, if there's any house DJs out there, and I think there  are about 70 remixes out there now.  So, uh, very catchy, some very catchy lyric, I could eat a knob at night.  Never mind your yesterdays or, or.  Yeah.  That's trash.  I could eat a knob at night.  I bet Paul McCartney is kicking himself.  Well, Heather Nils isn't kicking him.  Oh, God damn, Jimmy.  Ricky Dernick. 
[03:42:30]  That's royalty, Jimmy.  Let's go to Old Town.  Last, uh, last question for Ricky Jervis.  Uh, Jeff.  Hey, Ricky, your show extras on HBO is brilliant.  It's, it's, I think at least as good as The Office.  And I haven't heard whether or not they're going to renew it.  Are you going to, is that going to come back again?  Yeah, we are.  Yeah.  Um, we're, uh, we're filming it in June and July and it's, um, uh, scheduled to go out  in the fall in England.  And I assume there or thereabouts on HBO.  So, um, uh, I, I, I'd, I'd guess October. 
[03:43:00]  I tell you what you do best.  You make people, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,  you, you make comedy uncomfortable and that's, what's great about extras.  You're, you're willing to put yourself out there and make yourself or as a character  look like a complete ass.  Oh, that will, that will feel very, very uncomfortable for you.  It's fantastic.  I'm uncomfortable with them.  I've suffered from my art and now I want everyone else to.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you.  By the way, Ricky, um, uh, it's scheduled, um, scheduled.  I will speak in English again.  Yeah.  And it's aluminum.  What did he say?  I learned, when I first come to your country, I only speak English. 
[03:43:30]  Really?  But now I learned from your TV, America.  Aluminium.  Talk to the hand.  Very good.  You'll learn, you kids.  You old dog pound.  Very good.  All right, Ricky.  Ricky, thanks a lot, man.  Thank you.  My pleasure.  You're great, dude.  You really are brilliant.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Ricky.  Take care, man.  Okay, bye.  You want entertainment.  Wholesome, interesting entertainment. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Shut your face.  I'm a pervert.  You upcock!  Just take your hands and brush them gently on your nipples and just let you zone out.  Hope she's screaming like that later in an alley.  My junk smells like Wayne Newton.  So you're saying you make love to the dead.  Dresses make you want to get fucked up the butt.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian George Carlin. 
[03:44:30]  Hey, we got George Carlin's brother on the phone.  Oh, good.  Hey, Patrick.  Yeah, what's happening?  We've never met you before, but your brother used to talk highly of you.  I know that and me of him.  Yeah, and George used to do our show from time to time, and he was one of our favorite guests.  We all just love the guy, and obviously, sorry for his passing there.  Absolutely.  I know that, and we got past it.  And, you know, he was funny right till the end, man.  He left instructions.  And you can Google him up on georgecarlin.com, but I got a copy of him right here. 
[03:45:00]  Okay.  And it was his final instructions.  Upon his death, he wished to be cremated, and he went through all of this, you know?  And how he wanted the disposition of his ashes, and he's gotten, parenthesis, dispersal.  And then the last paragraph he had was, the exact nature of the gathering shall be determined  by my surviving family.  It should be extremely informal.  They should play rhythm and blues music, and they should laugh a lot. 
[03:45:30]  And vague references to spirituality, parenthesis, secular, will be permitted.  I mean, man, right till the end, he made it easy for everybody else.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, the last thing he shot, you're promoting, there's a CD of his last special, I think.  It's bad for you.  That's right.  And it was shot, I think it was March 2008, and it was really good.  I mean, it wasn't like, well, let's just watch Carla.  It was like, God damn it, he was really funny.  He was still rocking.  Yeah, he came in to promote that taping. 
[03:46:00]  I got to tell you, the cut on that, that I like the best, and I saw him on St. Patrick's  Eve up here in Kingston, and it was just dynamite, man, because the people love him, you know.  And he gets in and does that last one, I'm a modern man, and it's, you guys are music guys.  It's got rhythm, and it starts cooking.  And that's my favorite cut of that last CD.  Hey, Patrick, I got to ask you. 
[03:46:30]  But no one knew he was sick.  I mean, he did our show right around, yeah, not that long ago.  He came in, he looked healthy as an ox or whatever.  Yes.  And no one had a clue that he was on his way out.  What, his heart was starting to fail him?  I think his daughter Kelly knew how serious it was.  Now, me, he could keep me out in the ether, you know what I'm saying?  And he had his first heart attack in 78, and he got a stent, and then something happened  again, 81 or something, got another stent. 
[03:47:00]  And he would always say to me, like, yeah, I'm going in for a tune-up, man.  I'm on my way to the cardio guy.  And he'd be talking in the car on his way in to get these things done, and he made light  of it with me.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  And I'm an easy sail.  You know, I'm looking for the pony when you give me the little bag of droppings there.  And he kept me out in the woods on this thing.  The last time we spoke of it, now, over the years, that's 30 years the guy fought this 
[03:47:30]  heart thing.  And over the years, he picked up a defibrillator and a pacemaker and another stent.  And you know, every time, he never showed any pain or discomfort.  I mean, he was so courageous.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I mean, I saw him many times, and he rocked the stage.  You didn't have a clue that the guy had heart problems as he worked the crowd in that stage  like he did.  Absolutely.  And he would take all these medications and keep the blood thin and eat, you know, chicken  breasts and stuff.  And I remember when his breakfast was a can of beer and a joint. 
[03:48:00]  Back at all 519, 121st.  I got in there one morning.  I said, nice breakfast, man.  He says, yeah, yeah.  And, I mean, he was cool, and he kept it all controlled, and he kept me BS'd.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Are you older or younger, brother?  I'm five years older.  He especially just did.  He seemed healthier, and it's bad for you.  What was the special he did before, which was how he was standing in a cemetery?  Oh, that is my favorite.  That is my favorite picture. 
[03:48:30]  And me and my wife were just looking at it.  And that's from the one, Life is Worth Losing, okay?  And he's sitting.  I'm looking at one of the promo things for an HBO on that one.  I tore it out of some magazine.  I got it up on the wall here.  And he's got a look on his face, you guys.  Like, the left eyebrow is cocked and a small smile.  It's just dynamite.  Is that him in the cemetery?  The next to the last special, right?  That would be probably the next to the last. 
[03:49:00]  Life is Worth Losing.  Hey, Patrick, I got kind of an observation here.  Now, very tragic, you lost your brother, but you seem extremely positive about it.  I'm going to tell you why, man.  Because the first couple of weeks were grim, okay?  Okay.  When my boy, I mean, I had just been on the email thing with him.  He finally dragged me into the computer world, and my son, Dennis, bought me a little laptop.  And we'd been emailing maybe about a year or so.  Besides regular talking and all, you know, he would phone from anywhere.  And when Dennis gave me the word, I mean, man, I just, you know, you just, you go to pieces, you fall on the ground, you're wrecked. 
[03:49:30]  It's rotten.  I was just going through a little thing here, you know, my own.  But I am so upbeat because of the way he presented it.  You know what I'm saying?  He made the ashes thing fun.  And we took the ashes up to 120th and Riverside Drive and put some where he smoked his first joint when he was 13.  That's awesome.  All right.  We took some down to Birdland where he got Charlie Parker's autograph when he was a young dude wearing electric blue peg pants with gray pistol pockets, you know? 
[03:50:00]  And we took some up to a camp where he won five drama awards five years in a row.  And then we came back here where I'm living like, I'm living in Saugerties, New York, up in the woods, all right?  Sure.  He told me when it was retiring time, he says, go back east and find something you like and we'll buy it, man.  So here I am in the woods, and we went to this creek, and Kelly put the ashes down in the creek, which was dry, okay? 
[03:50:30]  It started raining 30 minutes after they headed to New York to go back and go to JFK for the coast.  And it kept raining until the thing got churning.  And now that water has taken his ashes down the Esopus Creek to the Hudson River, down the Hudson, out the harbor, into the Japanese current, up through the North Atlantic, south of Iceland, down the coast.  And his ashes are going to Ireland.  They're going to wash up there just like the coconuts do from Trinidad and Tobago and stuff, you know? 
[03:51:00]  And he's going to be on Ireland where he just became a citizen.  So George actually, the first one, you dropped it in, like, were these little weird places that meant something to him.  Yeah.  That's a pretty cool, especially the autograph one.  That's one you wouldn't think.  Like, you would think only...  My son thought of that.  My son Dennis thought of that.  Oh, this was Dennis's and your idea?  No, and Kelly's.  It was a family idea.  And George said on the dispersal thing, he said, I wish to be cremated. 
[03:51:30]  The disposition of my ashes at sea, on land, or in the air, shall be determined by my survival.  Living family, in accordance with their knowledge of my prejudices and philosophies regarding geography and spirituality.  Under no circumstances are my ashes to be retained by anyone or buried in a particular location.  The eventual dispersal can be delayed for any reasonable length of time required to reach a decision, but not to exceed one month following my death. 
[03:52:00]  Hey, was there anything...  What was it...  I mean, he was so...  Especially as comedians, I mean, Carlin was so...  He was so above us all.  He was a god to comedians.  I mean, none of us felt like we were in the same business as him.  What is something about him, or what was something private about him, or just that most people wouldn't know?  I mean, he was like an entity.  You couldn't even look at Carlin as a guy, almost, when you were...  Oh, I wish you'd met him, because...  Have you?  Yeah, yeah, I met him a couple times. 
[03:52:30]  Because he's not that way.  He ain't special.  He's right on the corner of 123rd in Amsterdam, man.  He's as real as mud.  Patrick, just so you know, you've got Jim Norton in the studio, who actually did a skit with George Carlin on...  Oh, wonderful.  ...on Tough Crowd.  And you've got two other comedians in the studio today, Robert Kelly and Greg Giraldo.  Greg and I actually did it with George.  It was a Tough Crowd.  Colin was the host, and the four comedians that day were Greg, myself, George, and a guy named Nick DiPaolo.  And during the Act 3 sketch, it was Carlin was playing a priest. 
[03:53:00]  Him and Colin were priests.  And I get to walk in and break the fourth wall with an album, and dress as an altar boy, and ask George to sign it.  And then he said something to me, and he called us cocksucking motherfuckers,  and he walked off the camera, and they bleeped it.  It was great.  I have a photo with him.  I'm dressing an altar boy.  He's dressing like a priest.  It's my fucking greatest celebrity photo.  That's beautiful, man.  He enjoyed doing that Cardinal Glick, too, in Dogma.  Oh, of course. 
[03:53:30]  Kevin Smith wrote a nice thing about him.  I want to say it was in Newsweek.  It was kind of like a nice little eulogy to George in Newsweek, I think.  I got a little bronze statue about three feet high in my dining room of Cardinal Glick  that Kevin had made for George as a gift.  That's great.  And we trucked it up here from after he was doing Jersey Girl, you know.  But, no, he was always the same guy.  The only thing that people might not know, but you'd certainly have to suspect it,  was that he worked on his material and honed it down. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, obviously.  Yeah, I mean, he was never the kind of guy to sit and stare at a newspaper or stare at  the blank sheet and wait for a thought.  I'd go down to see him in Atlantic City, and we'd maybe hang out for the weekend, because  that was a good place to goof.  And he'd have little yellow things all over his desk right near his computer.  He was computing for years, you know.  He used to call me a Luddite.  And he'd have these things here with the Swedish pretzels and Irish pearls and stuff.  And it all meant something to him, and it would pop up later as a big paragraph. 
[03:54:30]  Hey, Patrick, you sound a lot like your brother, just maybe a little more New Yorkish than George  did.  It's creepy at times.  Well, yeah, George and I, the voice thing, we had to be careful.  I mean, one time, you know, I was dating, and I'm married to her now.  But my wife, Marlene, called, and she started, and she said, wait, wait, wait, this is George,  you know, that was back in the 50s.  And I'd get his girlfriends and tell them, wait, and my mom could never tell.  Really?  Yeah.  She could never tell on the phone, man.  You guys should have, like, you know, you should have done some of the George Carlin interviews, 
[03:55:00]  radio interviews.  Let him rest.  Oh, no.  He had his thing to do, and I knew it early on, man.  But he always included me, you know, in everything.  Hey, Patrick, what do you do for a living?  Well, I'm up here in the woods, and, you know, I got a thing.  I got a book I wrote.  A manifesto?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's too lighthearted for that. 
[03:55:30]  You know, it's a little book about how it was to be in 1952 in Michigan.  And George, if you look at the Google thing, I really hate to talk about my book when I  want to talk about George, but he did love the damn thing, you know.  And it's called Highway 23, and it's around, you know, but it's a self-published thing.  But I really would prefer to talk about George.  Yeah, right on.  Okay.  Hey, what do you miss about George the most?  Oh, just him.  I'm going to tell you.  He would phone at any hour of the day, you know what I'm saying? 
[03:56:00]  And it would be, you'd hear this, you'd hear, hey there.  And I would, my whole mood, I don't care if the bridge had broken.  My whole mood just elevated, man.  And I'd say, hey, what's up?  Well, I'm on San Vicente right now.  And that was it, man.  He just was in my soul.  And, you know, the other day, you guys saw him.  He always had that jacket, NFL on CBS, right? 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  And that would be his trademark.  I'd go to see him in Red Bank, New Jersey, or up here in Turning Stone or some Indian reservation or something.  God bless him.  I hope they win the country back.  But I would go see him, and he'd always have that jacket on, right?  And I was driving to Kingston the other morning, and I didn't have the radio on or nothing.  I was just thinking.  And I, like, pictured him sitting next to me in that jacket.  And you guys are way too young to remember movies called Topper. 
[03:57:00]  But it was about a guy who got killed in a car wreck, a young couple.  And they would come back and talk to this one guy, Topper.  And it was like he was, you know, it's really great, man, because he's here with me.  Yeah.  I hope I didn't scare you.  No, not at all, man.  Put him on the phone.  It's very interesting to listen to.  Yeah, if he's there with you, put him on the phone.  Yeah, that's what he had with me.  Okay, man.  Say a couple of words to these guys, George.  You know what the beauty...  All right, blow it out your ass, you dickheads. 
[03:57:30]  Oh.  You know, one of the great things about your brother, too, was it was just comedically  how he never went the predictable angle.  Like, he just really wouldn't.  Like, even the beheadings, and that was in Life is Worth Losing.  Yeah.  Where he was saying how tragic they are.  They're having their heads cut off.  Yeah.  And he went, fuck him.  Yeah.  Stay out of another man's country, Jack.  Yeah.  And I was like, god damn it, I wish I had said those words.  What a fucking great comic thing to say. 
[03:58:00]  Ah, yeah.  Fuck him.  But he never took the predictable way.  That's the truth.  Never.  That is the truth, man.  And he had this gift of being able to...  I mean, he was never preachy.  Like, even when he was getting to a point, he would, A, always make you laugh, but there  were times where you didn't even mind just hearing his take on things because he was  so brilliant that his take on things would actually affect the way you looked at them  in real life.  Oh, yeah.  He really had a gift.  Oh, yeah.  And I got like, you know, he was born a Catholic and raised a Catholic and kicked off the choir 
[03:58:30]  boys, kicked off the whole trip, man.  But our friends who went to Springfield, some of his asses around and stuff, they're people  that still go to Catholic church and go to mass and everything.  And they still love that one where he talks about, there's a big man up in the sky.  And they love that.  You know, his take on religion and God was just amazing.  Speaking of that, was George scared of dying?  God, no.  Not a bit. 
[03:59:00]  I hope I'm that courageous, man.  I really do.  He did not give a damn right from the beginning till the end.  Because a lot of people, when they don't believe in God, it makes it a little more scary.  Because the people that believe in God, they're like, well, at least there might be something  after this.  So, yeah, hold on to that hope.  No, our family took the bummer out of that.  If there are obscure things here and there where he's doing an interview and he'll refer  to the big electron.  Right.  And that's a thing that we talked about, the big electron being this electron that blew up 
[03:59:30]  and started the Big Bang, okay?  And the big electron is the whole universe.  And a man asked me yesterday, where do I think George is right now?  I think he's up in the cosmos, okay?  And his molecules and stuff were around and ashes are blowing just like Julius Caesar's  and all the old dead people.  And that's all just part of the universe, man.  And Nate, the universe is like billions of years you're talking about.  He could condense and he could cause an asteroid that could come back and wreck the whole damn 
[04:00:00]  thing.  I'm sure he'd love that, too.  He would.  No kidding.  He would.  You know, one of the, oh, fuck, I just lost my thought.  No, you didn't.  God damn the thought of me.  It'll come back.  It's up in the cosmos, man.  I know.  It's in the toilet.  I had a good one, too.  It just fucking completely left my brain.  I'm still creeped out by the fact that George Carlin's ashes are in the Hudson River somewhere.  And, you know, I don't want any George Carlin in my eyes or anything. 
[04:00:30]  Let me tell you something.  All of a sudden, the wind kicks up and I got some George in my eyes.  There's a little Carlin on you.  And we were throwing his ashes over the wall at Riverside Drive.  Yeah.  Some of it blew back onto some of the ladies and they were so happy, man.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And it was just, you know, it's a thing like the Hudson.  He used to swim in the Hudson, same as I did and all.  And, you know, the Hudson is full of condoms and turds, right?  Well, he had a great joke about that and you were all diseased.  He's like, that's why.  He's like, we would jump in the river, you know, to cool off. 
[04:01:00]  He said we were tempered and raw shit.  Yeah.  And that's why they have such strong immune systems.  Let me tell you about that, man.  Nobody in our corner or our neighborhood or anything ever got polio.  Ever, never, man.  Because we believed that swimming in the river gave you natural immunities.  I got a buddy in California, Eddie Harnby, and we still laugh about that swimming in the river thing.  And George and I loved it.  When you would go to swim in the river, say there were six of you, okay, and you go down to 123rd  and you're on the other side of the West Side Highway. 
[04:01:30]  And it's not as manicured as it was, you know, then it was very nice.  Now it's proper looking with a path for bike riders and stuff.  But you'd get down there and you'd go swimming and you would choose fingers to see who would go first.  And the first guy would throw, like, a big rock through this thing that was about 12 feet out.  We called it the shit line.  You had, like, turds.  You had condoms.  You had pieces of wood, orange peels, diesel fuel, and all of this floating along. 
[04:02:00]  The second kid would then do a cannonball, and the third one a cannonball.  If you were, like, the fourth, fifth, or sixth kid, you could get a clean shot through to swim out past the shit line.  And then you were okay because of the people that go by on the day line and you could moon them, right?  But now you come back, it's time to swim in, and you've got to get past the shit line, and you're on your own coming in.  So you did.  You put your hands up in front of your face, and then you swept them outward, and you swept them outward, and that was called the Hudson Crawl. 
[04:02:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, sweeping them aside, man.  Sweeping up, getting them buoyant turds moving, getting them condoms dry, and you're back on shore.  Then you went home and took a shower.  You know how much money Jimmy could have saved with that?  Hey, I had a buddy.  I had a buddy who used to get boils, okay?  And he would bust a boil open and soak it in the Hudson River down there, and it would dry it up.  You guys must have got the best pot in New York City. 
[04:03:00]  You guys are insane.  Look at this guy.  There's a great thing, too, at the end of the same special.  I love the balls he had, too, where he's talking about how there's no God.  Yeah.  But he ends it, like, seriously.  He, like, says there's no God, never was.  And this was, like, a live HBO special.  Yeah.  What a great way to end a special.  Like, all kidding aside, go fuck yourselves.  Absolutely.  Tell him the truth, man.  Tell him how he sees it, you know.  Yeah.  Because the way we see the big electron, and me and George used to goof about this and laugh on it a lot. 
[04:03:30]  He don't care which team wins.  The big electron doesn't care about your mama.  He doesn't care about which political guy.  He does not care.  All the earth is to him is a show with a bunch of six billion lunatics running around going ape shit.  He does not care.  He, at times, like, when you'd watch his take on things, and you'd hear how, how, to, he had a great gift of singularity, where he could, he could narrow something down to its core immediately, and just, like, really, really deconstruct something. 
[04:04:00]  And you'd watch him do that, and sometimes it's like watching the only guy who's awake while everybody else is sleeping.  That's the impression you got, because he was so to the point.  You're like, how did, first of all, as a comic, he always made you feel like shit, because you're like, how did none of us think of this?  Yeah.  Like, how did every fucking time he would find what the rest of us missed?  Yeah.  And even stupid things like voting, how they say, hey, you didn't vote, you can't complain. 
[04:04:30]  And he said, that's exactly why I can't complain, because I didn't contribute to it.  You did.  Either way, yes.  Oh, yes, you're on the money, man.  Yeah, I love that line.  You're really into his head.  What a great, what a great angle to take that I never heard anybody else take.  And I think he took it automatically.  Yeah.  It's just his way of discernment.  But when he was a tiny kid, he was, you know, he would look things through.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful gift, and he used it, and he worked it, man.  And I'm so glad he got that Mark Twain award before he died. 
[04:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, not a posthumous thing.  It was awarded to him as a living dude.  Patrick, it's been a pleasure.  Listen, you guys are great.  His death came out of nowhere.  When it hit my BlackBerry, I'm like, what?  Yeah.  I didn't even know he was sick, any of that.  And we had a good relationship.  He was starting to do our show a little bit more.  Oh, yeah.  And we were looking forward to, you know, more appearances by George on our show.  Oh, God.  And just an obvious loss to, you know, the comedic world there. 
[04:05:30]  Oh, I thank you so much for that.  And let's just promote this.  You can go to georgecarlin.com or the CD.  It really was a great special.  It was the last special he shot in March of this year.  It's bad for you.  And once again, he just takes a common thought and he just, he goes with it where no other  comic has gone.  He was just, he was just so great, man.  I mean, what else can you say about George Carlin?  He was a fucking genius.  It makes me feel good to know how all you guys appreciate him.  Oh, my God.  We all looked up to him in different ways, obviously, but we all looked up to George. 
[04:06:00]  I said it.  He was the greatest.  He's the greatest comedian I ever saw.  Simple as that.  He was the greatest brother anybody could ever be.  How many brothers did you have, though?  I only had him, man, and that was plenty.  That was all I needed.  Hey, Patrick, we want to play something from It's Bad for You.  What do you suggest?  Please play a modern man.  A modern man.  Do we have that in the big system?  Hopefully.  All right.  We'll try to find it.  I'm waiting for the thumbs up there, Patrick. 
[04:06:30]  Okay, because you'll hear music during it.  It's got, oh, it's got such a thing to it.  Okay.  And we'd like to have you on the show again.  You seem like an interesting fella yourself there, Patrick.  That interesting is a beautiful word like the Chinese use it.  Yes, I'd love to talk with you guys again.  It's been really wonderful.  Patrick, do you smoke the herb or what?  Listen, bro, George got me into the herb, and I'm going to smoke till I croak. 
[04:07:00]  How old are you?  I'm 76, and I don't give a good goddamn about nothing.  Well, thanks a lot for calling in, man.  We don't have that?  It's Bad for You is the new CD.  Patrick, we're just getting the new CD in the system.  We don't have that one yet.  Is there another one?  Oh, any of the others are good.  That's just like my big fave.  All right, I'm sorry.  We wanted to play your favorite track, but we don't have it.  That's okay.  I loved them all because I saw that performance, man, and he knocked them dead in Kingston.  All right.  Patrick Carlin, everyone. 
[04:07:30]  George Carlin.  And I'm soaked good.  Go light up, all right?  We got to go.  Take care, man.  You're like a mind reader.  Patrick Carlin, everyone.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  This guy, he rules.  He rules.  Jesus.  He never had to work a day in his life.  No.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Apparently not.  Boy, George lives on in cyberspace, too, huh?  Yeah.  And on the web.  Everyone lives on on the web.  He sounds a lot like George Carlin. 
[04:08:00]  Yeah, he does.  He's mad at you, too.  Creepy.  All right, we're going to play a track from It's Bad for You.  I don't know what E-Rock's got queued up, but hopefully.  Wait, wait.  What are some of the track titles?  Yeah, what do we got?  This one's called Address Book.  It's about people dying.  Oh, okay, cool.  Do we want to do that one?  Why not?  The more and more, the better.  All right, let's do this one, and we'll continue.  See what I've been doing?  Going through my address book and crossing out the dead people.  You do a lot of fun, isn't it?  Gives you a good feeling.  Kind of gives you a feeling of power.  A superiority to have outlasted another old friend. 
[04:08:30]  But you can't do it too soon, you know?  You can't do it too soon.  You can't come running home from the funeral and get the book out, you know?  You can't do that.  A little time has to pass.  You have to let a little time go by.  I have a rule of thumb, six weeks.  If you're a friend of mine and you're in my book and you die,  I leave you alone for an extra six weeks.  Six extra weeks in the book on the house, it's on me.  But after that, hey, facts are facts.  Fuck you, you're dead.  Out you fucking go. 
[04:09:00]  You gotta have standards, you know?  Now, these days, a lot of people don't keep analog address books anymore.  They don't want to be writing that stuff out longhand.  They're in the computer age, and they have an application in the computer called Outlook  or Contacts or Address Book, something like that.  So they keep all the information in the computer, and they sync it up with their phone every day  or every other day.  So now, instead of scratching out a name, you get to delete the fuck. 
[04:09:30]  And deleting someone is an even more powerful feeling than simply scratching out a name.  You know how to delete someone.  You select the name, highlight the person, and then...  Straight into the trash.  Now, if it's a really close friend of yours,  you might not want to empty the trash for about six weeks.  Or, if it's a little too harsh for you, 
[04:10:00]  a little too harsh to delete an old friend,  you can always create a new folder.  A special folder for dead people.  You keep it on your desktop.  It's kind of a digital purgatory.  And the nice thing is, every now and then, you can open it up and you can look inside. 
[04:10:30]  And you can see the people in purgatory.  And you can move them all around, you know?  Move them around.  Put them in little groups.  Two people who can get along in life.  Put them in a corner.  Let them work it out.  Let them work it out in purgatory.  Or start a fight.  Have a big fight in purgatory.  That's a lot of...  Nobody's going to get hurt.  They're all fucking dead anyway.  Then you put them in a big formation and have a parade.  The purgatory parade of dead people. 
[04:11:00]  Ah, there's a lot of fun you can have with a computer.  So enjoy your digital selves.  Now, speaking of dead people, there are things we say when someone dies.  Most of us say.  A lot of us do.  Things we say that no one ever questions.  They just kind of go unexamined.  Give me a couple examples.  After someone dies, the following conversation is bound to take place probably more than once.  Two guys meet on the street.  Hey, did you hear? 
[04:11:30]  Phil Davis died.  Phil Davis?  I just saw him yesterday.  Okay.  Yeah.  Didn't help.  He died anyway.  Apparently, the simple act of your seeing him did not slow his cancer down.  In fact, it may have made it more aggressive.  You know, you could be responsible for Phil's death.  How do you live with yourself? 
[04:12:00]  Here's another thing we say.  Hey, this is something that is usually said to the surviving spouse.  Usually a woman because of the way it works.  Listen, if there's anything I can do, anything at all, please don't hesitate to ask.  What are you going to do, a resurrection?  This ain't the fucking New Testament, you know.  You know what you tell a guy like that who wants to help?  Oh, fine.  Why don't you come over next weekend?  You can paint the garage. 
[04:12:30]  Bring your plunger.  The upstairs toilet overflowed and there's shit all over the floor up there.  Do you drive a tractor?  Good.  That'll come in handy.  The North 40 needs a lot of attention.  Bring your chainsaw and your pickaxe.  We're going to put your ass to work.  He wants to help?  Fuck him.  Call his bluff.  Call his bluff.  The nerve of these pricks.  Here's another thing we say to the surviving spouse.  I'm keeping him in my thoughts. 
[04:13:00]  Where?  Where exactly in your thoughts does he fit?  In between my ass hurts in this chair and let's fuck the waitress?  What are your priorities?  We use a lot of euphemisms when we talk about death, you know.  People say things like, you know I lost my father.  Ah, he'll turn up. 
[04:13:30]  You got to stay optimistic with people like that.  Give them reason to hope.  Have you checked the dumpster out back?  He used to like to take a nap in there.  Keep it upbeat.  Opie and Anthony.  Angry Nintendo nerd.  Now he's an angry video game nerd because he's kind of gotten into other things.  But he started out doing just Nintendo games, but he got into Sega and stuff. 
[04:14:00]  And he's apparently a fan, WISP, Opie and Anthony wow sticker is on the side of his television  that he hooks the gaming systems up to.  By the way, a little help for everybody trying to make their viral video.  Everyone's trying to make the video that's going to get that big hit.  Millions of views.  If you show that you're an Opie and Anthony fan, we'll kind of help you out a little bit.  Believe me, when we mention it.  If the video's good and it's obvious that you're a fan of our show, you can't lose. 
[04:14:30]  Don't beg though.  Yeah, don't beg.  No begging.  Like this guy had a casual Opie and Anthony WISP wow sticker on the side of his old TV, right?  Yeah, and he found a great internet niche.  He reviews ancient games.  Games from 1986, 87, 88, from the original Nintendo systems.  And he's funny.  He's definitely funny.  Some of these games when he reviews like the Back to the Future game is really funny.  The Top Gun game because he doesn't like any of them. 
[04:15:00]  And he just rattles off curses about how much these things suck.  Well, that's the first one we got.  The nerd reviews Top Gun for the NES.  I don't remember this game.  Can we explain it really fast?  It was very two-dimensional.  It was supposed to be like pretty much the first type of flight simulator game.  But you flew over the clouds.  It was just like nothing, just white.  The bottom of the screen was white. 
[04:15:30]  The top of the screen was blue.  And the enemies came flying at you.  And you just went, or shot a missile at them.  And then you had to land on a carrier, which he says is impossible.  And he keeps crashing and cursing.  Yeah.  Someone who works for Rick Springfield wants to invite us to the Rick Springfield, Eddie Money Show.  At Westbury tonight.  Dr. Noah Drake from General Hospital.  I can't make it.  I'll be on a plane. 
[04:16:00]  But I'd love to if I was going to be in town and had absolutely nothing else.  Hey, it's David from Plainview.  He goes, hey, guys, I work for Rick Springfield and love the bit you guys did about him.  I travel and listen to you all the time.  Rick and Eddie Money are playing in Westbury tonight.  If you'd be at all interested, you're all welcome to be my guests.  Well, do they like us?  That's the key.  Or the show?  I don't even think Rick Springfield knows where to lie.  He does, actually.  He does?  Jimmy, does he really?  I met him.  Bruce.  I remember Bruce from XM. 
[04:16:30]  The crying Bruce.  Right.  Introduced me, actually.  Absolutely crying over here.  Can we play that today?  That's great.  I love that.  I don't know.  That makes fun of someone.  That's not nice.  And it's kind of sad now because he no longer works for XM.  He cares.  All right, here we go.  I'll put him in mind.  The nerd reviews Top Gun.  The Top Gun sort of marks the beginning of a genre.  It was one of the first flight simulation games for the Nintendo Entertainment System,  or at least one of the most commonly referred to.  We obviously know that it ain't got shit compared with games today, 
[04:17:00]  and for that reason, you might think it's not worth complaining about.  But no.  It sucks ass now, and it sucked ass back then.  Check it out.  Mission one is training for the next mission.  Okay, sounds simple enough.  So you get a choice of missiles.  So would you rather have more or less?  What kind of fucking choice is that?  Pick more.  I mean, the idea is that the fewer missiles is more powerful, but guess what?  Whenever you shoot an enemy plane, all it takes is one shot to blow them up.  Even your regular machine gun bullets take them down in one shot. 
[04:17:30]  So what's the point?  Yeah.  They'd have, like, different types of missiles.  Right.  Real powerful ones, but you can only carry 20 of them.  And then they'd have, like, missiles that weren't that powerful.  You could carry 40.  But any missile, you hit a plane once, and they blow up.  All right, so there's no...  Yeah.  So who cares?  There's no difference in the big missiles and the little missiles.  So bad.  Such a horrible game.  Gameplay is boring.  Landing on the carrier is impossible?  Yeah.  All right.  The first thing that really sucks about the gameplay is just the fact that it's boring. 
[04:18:00]  90% of the time, you're just flying into a blank sky  as little pieces of cotton come flying at you.  And yes, I know they're supposed to be clouds.  Also, notice the absence of music.  I know the developers were trying to make something new to make it realistic,  but what we get is a game that makes you feel like you're in this blank, mindless void.  Like, if purgatory exists, this is what it is.  Top gun for the NES.  I'd rather fly a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong. 
[04:18:30]  Uh-oh, I'm really fucked now.  I gotta land on an aircraft carrier.  A feat?  That's impossible.  Your radar monitor gives you instructions on how to land,  but no matter what you do, you still crash.  You know, it's like, every time I get to this part,  I think I might have a chance.  This is gonna be it.  I'm finally gonna land the plane.  Speed down.  Left, left.  Speed up.  Right, right.  Speed up.  Speed down. 
[04:19:00]  Left, left.  Speed up.  Speed down.  Up, up, up, up.  I'm hitting up.  Ass!  Fuck!  And then, uh, trying to refuel the plane is also impossible?  Yeah.  Halfway through this level, your fuel starts to run out,  so this refueling plane comes, and you have to control its nozzle. 
[04:19:30]  So just like landing the plane, this is impossible,  and I've never once done it.  You just have to be lucky.  I mean, your accuracy has to be 100% perfect.  And really, I don't have a fucking clue how it works.  Down, down.  Speed up.  Down, down.  Left, left.  Left, left.  Down, down.  Up, up.  What the fuck?  What was I supposed to do?  Now look at the plane.  It just goes away like, fuck him.  I mean, they just leave you out here to die.  At this point, it should just say, game over. 
[04:20:00]  But instead, it allows you to play for a little longer,  which is pointless.  You're done for.  The refueling plane doesn't come back,  and within minutes, your fuel runs out,  and you finally lose.  And that's as far as I ever got.  What a shitload of fuck.  This game chews turds.  This game sucks your balls off and spits them up your ass.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  All right, the nerd reviews Back to the Future.  What was this game about, Anthony? 
[04:20:30]  Back to the Future?  Well, he says the nerd, the angry nerd or whatever,  the game has almost nothing to do with the movie.  Yeah, it really doesn't.  It's just ridiculous.  I think he explains it.  OJ's on TV because they put him in a new football game,  and he has to give that money to the Ole Miss.  Nice.  Freddy's right there, man.  Boy, that guy, he fucked up.  He killed the wrong snotty-looking kid.  God bless Fred Goldman.  All right, here we go. 
[04:21:00]  Here's the Back to the Future review.  This game is horrible.  This game is so bad,  I really don't want to play it.  But Darth Vader came from the planet Vulcan  and said that he'll melt my brains if I don't,  so I don't have a choice.  The first thing I really admire  is how well it followed the movie.  And you gotta love that music.  Great Scott! 
[04:21:30]  Sounds just like the movie, right?  No!  And that's it.  It just loops over and over again.  And you're not going to believe it,  but that's all you hear the entire game.  I don't believe it!  Yep, from the title screen  all the way to the end,  the same fucking music.  No!  I'd rather have a fucking buffalo  take a diarrhea dump in my ear  than subject them in this horrendous garbage.  Diarrhea dump in my ear.  Guy gives an honest review. 
[04:22:00]  Yeah, that's good.  Very good review.  So you're walking through Hill Valley  and every single thing you can imagine  is out to kill you.  Holy shit!  Bullies,  hula hoop girls,  killer bees,  and guys holding glass windows  just like in the movie.  What happened here?  Is this Hill Valley or is it hell?  No, it's Hill Valley,  although I can't imagine hell being much worse.  I never knew a hula hoop girl  could be so deadly.  Why does she want to kill Marty anyway? 
[04:22:30]  He's an asshole!  Not to mention,  it doesn't even look like Marty.  Look at that black helmet head.  Also, when did he ever wear  that sleeveless black shirt?  Oh, look.  I got a bowling ball.  Remember that in the movie?  Remember when Marty goes around  throwing bowling balls at people?  What was this?  What?  What were they thinking?  Hello?  Hello?  Anybody home?  I don't remember when he throws  bowling balls at people.  I'm going to have to watch a lot of these  when I get home. 
[04:23:00]  Yeah, it really brings you back too  because I remember playing these games  and you didn't think they sucked as much  then when you were playing them.  They were all from a sky view.  Yeah, top-down view.  It was just awful.  And you had no real concept of technology  when you were a lot younger  so you just thought they would never get better than this?  No.  That this was it  and it was pretty damn cool.  It was great.  You know what's the worst thing about this game?  Is that it bears the name  Back to the Future.  A movie well worth  putting more time and effort 
[04:23:30]  into making a decent game.  And the movie came out in 85.  The game, 89.  There's no excuse.  No fucking excuse.  Just suddenly orders are passed.  Quick, make a shitty game  name it after a big movie  and then just spit it into all the stores  for all the kids to buy for 50 bucks.  Yeah, 50 fucking bucks.  There was no internet to look up reviews back then.  It was just, you know,  you buy a game and you hope for the best.  And with Back to the Future,  how could you go wrong?  Oh yeah, you can fucking go wrong, alright? 
[04:24:00]  Like, if I just shat into a bag  and wrote Back to the Future on it,  that would be the same  as this awful piece of shit.  It brings my piss to a boil.  What a piece of shit.  He's definitely, uh...  That's fine.  Yeah.  Definitely got a little niche there, you know?  If I shat into a bag...  A bag and wrote Back to the Future on it.  We gotta get another one of these for tomorrow.  Maybe get another game he's reviewing. 
[04:24:30]  Yes, it's true.  Back to the Future 2 and 3.  Two shitty games for the price of one.  Let's check it out.  Holy shit!  Look, the DeLorean!  Now, I remember that from the movie.  Not so much the piranhas,  the snails,  the weird face,  the running frog,  the bouncy thing,  the thing in the sewer  that comes out and kills Marty,  the little dinosaurs,  the cloud that drops pellets,  and whatever the fucking goddamn hell that is.  Look at those. 
[04:25:00]  What are they?  Goombas and the spiky thing  ripped right off of Super Mario Brothers?  Fucking slackers.  And every time you die,  the DeLorean drops you off.  And it seems like it always takes you  in the opposite direction  of what you're trying to go.  Shit soup.  It's a Mario Brothers rip-off.  Yeah.  Yeah, there were just a couple of games back then.  They put different names on them.  Right.  Changed a few of the pixels  to look like something else. 
[04:25:30]  But it's pretty much Mario Brothers.  Same thing, yeah.  You just jump.  Do they still make this game?  Oh, hell no.  Is Intellivision even sold anymore?  Oh, God, no.  You can probably find, like,  some weird store somewhere.  Intellivision.  You have to go to a thrift store.  I think thrift stores have, like,  you can find the gaming system sometimes  in some of the games.  Yeah, there's a...  Like 50 cents.  Somewhere in Manhattan,  there's, like, a gaming store  that sells just all old games.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I don't know where it is,  but there is one.  But that's all they sell.  They don't sell any of the new stuff. 
[04:26:00]  They'll sell the Intellivision  and the Atari and all that shit.  Mike, Iraq hasn't Intellivision.  Do you really?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  Mike, go ahead real fast.  An update on the OJ thing.  Go ahead, Mike.  All right.  What's up, guys?  I just wanted to give you guys a heads up.  In the game,  OJ's actually on a team called the Assassins.  Oh, in that football game?  Really?  Yeah.  And...  Danny's saying no.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Now, OJ's in the game. 
[04:26:30]  You can make your own team  and, like, name it and stuff.  So they thought...  The developers thought it would be funny  to put him on a team called the Assassins.  He's not...  It's like if you buy the game,  he's not on a team called the Assassins.  They made that.  And that's how it was presented.  Yeah, they don't have, like, any...  Wait, Danny.  What's the name of the team he's on in the game?  He's not on a team.  You could put him on a team.  Oh.  So they made a team called the Assassins.  Oh, okay, okay.  You can put him on it.  Oh, so you can put him on it.  But then he could be on a team called, like, the Nice Guys.  Yeah, exactly.  Or the...  I didn't cut my wife's throat.  It's the worst. 
[04:27:00]  The worst.  The worst.  I will be in Anthony.  Hey, a little earlier, we were talking about, like, porn games that were available for the Atari system back in the day.  Back in the, what, early to mid-80s?  Yeah.  And Angry Video Game Nerd, who we're a big fan of.  And he's a fan of ours, by the way.  He's got a WoW sticker in a lot of his YouTube videos.  It should be mentioned.  He reviewed a few more of these angry...  A few more of these, like, porno games for the Atari system. 
[04:27:30]  Angry Video Game Nerd.  More Atari porno games.  Uh, this first one is called, Beat Em and Eat Em.  Let's see what this is about, according to the Angry Video Game Nerd.  All right.  What kind of surprise do we have in here?  Beat Em and Eat Em.  A girl licking an ice cream cone.  But what the f*** is the title about?  It doesn't sound pornographic.  It sounds violent, like you beat somebody up and eat em.  Oh, I get it.  Beat Em and Eat Em.  Oh, dear. 
[04:28:00]  What have I gotten myself into?  All you do is move these two sluts back and forth to catch this stuff that this guy shoots down.  Yummy.  Let's take a look at the manual.  And here it says,  The object of the game is to eat him every time he beats him.  You score one point for each and a f*** without a miss.  But should you miss, shame on you.  You lose one turn.  After all, it could have been a famous doctor or lawyer.  Wow, I'm watching the video.  Yeah.  It's being played. 
[04:28:30]  It's, uh, beat em and eat em.  Jeez, man.  This is twisted.  Girls are down below trying to catch something.  And the two girls move at the same time?  Yeah.  They move exactly the same way.  You all right, Jimmy?  Did it go well?  Um, hey, we're fighting for every possible word for this damn radio show.  At first, Tom was like, well, this is why.  Uh, but then he's like, well, I'll listen to it.  Because I said, like, Patricia's doing a, uh, it was a really funny racial parody.  But it wasn't, it wasn't like some anger thing. 
[04:29:00]  Like, he's reading the paper going, do you believe the, it wasn't like that.  It was a very funny thing.  It's like, there has to be some kind of context for stuff.  Yeah.  Like you said before, context.  Right.  It's just enraging.  Right.  That, uh.  And this is the stuff Tracy should be doing for the show, by the way, instead of getting  in, you know.  Let her do it to you.  Who cares?  You know, instead of her.  I'd rather talk to Tom anyway than just go to somebody else.  Instead of her getting insulted because we were having a little fun on the show.  Exactly.  And it doesn't matter.  Who cares?  You know, you should be in Tom's office every day arguing and fighting for all this stuff  for us.  Maybe she is.  Or maybe she just punishes us by saying, well, I'll show them. 
[04:29:30]  Then show us.  Don't take, yeah, don't, don't take what you hear on our show personally.  It's not, it's not your job as a PD to get personally insulted and hurt.  That amazed me, by the way.  I was, I was amazed.  All right.  Anyway, let's move on.  Uh, but it went well, Jimmy.  I mean, Tom, you know, he's working with us.  He's trying the best he can.  He's reasonable.  And I'm not saying that to suck up to him because he's a creepy corporate man, but he  is a reasonable guy.  And he said, he'll listen to it.  He's a reasonable man.  This humongous. 
[04:30:00]  We're all reasonable men.  All right, here we go.  So, um, another game called Kaboom, another porno game that was available for the Atari  system.  So the gameplay is basically the same sort of thing as Kaboom, except Kaboom was a great  game, but this is just a.  Oh, okay.  This is more on a beat him and eat him.  And they're comparing it to Kaboom.  If you remember that game, I don't obviously.  Remember the name.  So the gameplay is basically the same sort of thing as Kaboom, except Kaboom was a great  game.  But this is just a miserable load of.  You got to be completely accurate to land in their mouths. 
[04:30:30]  And it uses the sound effects from Pac-Man.  Oh, God.  You get an extra life if you get 69 points.  That's clever, right?  You know, there's really something wrong with this whole scene.  You got to be a total whore to stand naked at the bottom of a building with your mouth  wide open to catch from some guy on top of a roof.  What kind of sick bitches are these?  And what's the deal with this guy?  Either he has a huge or he's a dwarf.  What the kind of game is this? 
[04:31:00]  Tony, this guy has found his niche, obviously.  Angry video game nerd.  We got to get him on the show.  I've been saying that for a while.  There are guys that are trying to rip him off too and do their own like angry video game  reviews, he's the innovator.  He found a niche.  He was able to do it and pull it off.  And he's very popular.  You can tell he's authentic.  You can tell that's his thing.  Yeah, he knows the games.  He's not overacting or anything.  This is just how he is in his regular life.  We got to get him on the show, please.  Have we?  Oh, we're trying?  What's the answer, Dan?  He's so famous that we can't get him on the show. 
[04:31:30]  He's a fan of the show.  He's got a wow sticker in some of these videos.  Yeah, I saw that.  That are on YouTube.  All right, let's move on because we're running out of show here.  Another game that was a porno game for the Atari system.  This is Bachelorette Party and Bachelor Party.  All right, now here's one for the girls.  It's called Bachelorette Party.  Yeah, it's a whole bunch of naked dudes.  Whoa, watch out, guys.  It's some crazy bitch bouncing off the walls.  And it hardly even looks like a girl.  I mean, look at this.  It could be Swamp Thing for all I care.  The gameplay is basically like Breakout but flipped on its side. 
[04:32:00]  You control that thing on the left to catch the girl and just bang all the guys.  What a whore.  Now here's one for the guys.  It's Bachelor Party.  It's the same exact game except it's a dude going around having sex with a bunch of girls.  What a stud.  This one's called Gigolo.  The idea is that you're this nude woman on the streets going around breaking into random houses  where you find men to have your way with.  What? 
[04:32:30]  The sounds are amazing.  Some of these are better to watch in video form, obviously.  But great audio.  Moving on.  This is a game called Philly Flasher.  It always sounded like static.  Huh?  It always sounded like static.  The sound effects.  Right.  Throw a fourth sound in there.  The boo-doo-doo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is that?  No sound is like that in real life.  Boo-doo-doo-doo. 
[04:33:00]  It sounds like nothing.  Boo-doo-doo-doo.  Here's the Philly Flasher.  Now we got Philly Flasher.  Somebody please explain this one to me.  Philly Flasher?  Like Philadelphia?  What's Philadelphia make you think of?  Ugly people.  Ben Franklin.  The Liberty Bell.  Rocky.  Cheese steaks.  A witch shooting milk at her.  Well, there's no doubt that the game could take place in any city and that the title is only phonetic.  It might as well be Chicago.  Dallas.  The game's basically the same as beat him and eat him. 
[04:33:30]  The only difference is that it's two guys drinking milk from a witch's.  This game really disturbs me.  But I don't get it.  Is this supposed to be erotic?  I don't know about you, but I'm not at all turned on by some old wrinkly witch.  That's nasty, man.  What sick came up with this?  What were they thinking?  The Philly Flasher, so it's a witch?  A witch and you got a drink.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What were they thinking?  Somebody actually said, I got an idea for a game. 
[04:34:00]  Yeah.  And it's like, yeah, okay, get the programmers on that.  I guess it would be obviously funny before erotic because that just sounds ridiculous.  You know what it was?  For like two seconds, on a whim, you'd probably buy the game and go, oh, let me check this  out.  And then you're like, oh, this sucks.  Oh, well.  Back to back, man.  Yeah.  Finally, we got Knight on the Town.  Spelled with a K?  Yes.  And then, comma, Jungle Fever. 
[04:34:30]  Now we got Knight on the Town.  I suppose you're a knight and you're on a quest for the holy ass.  That's right.  Your goal is that princess on the top of the castle.  What he wants to do with her?  Well, take a guess.  So as usual, the object's pretty simple.  You just grab the blocks and build the bridge.  But watch out for that crazy monster.  And if the alligators get you, they bite your d*** off.  There's no point of walking because he's so damn slow.  So you just got to keep jumping and keep in rhythm so you don't hit the monster or the 
[04:35:00]  alligators.  I don't have any idea what these things on their heads are.  They look like Dr. Seuss characters.  But one thing I never expected to see Dr. Seuss characters do is this.  All right.  Just one more game because I've had enough.  This one is Jungle Fever.  I like to call it Jungle Fever.  Well, honestly, I don't know what to say about this one.  How did they come up with this stuff?  All right, guys.  Let's have a naked, big-breasted woman hanging from a helicopter shooting at flames with a  naked guy in between and some cannibal bitches, I guess, trying to kill you. 
[04:35:30]  What the f***?  The goal is to put out the flames and rescue them.  And to celebrate, why not?  There you go.  You can check out those videos on YouTube, obviously.  It's Angry Video Game Nerd.  He's entertaining.  All right.  I don't like the fresh talk.  It's the worst.  Worst.  Of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Here's the Angry Video Game Nerd.  So it's Dragon's Lair.  He's reviewing this.  These videos, of course, if you don't know by now, are all over YouTube. 
[04:36:00]  We love this guy.  Dragon's Lair.  The adventure is a Dirk the Daring who has to rescue a princess from a dragon.  All right.  My first impression is that the graphics are quite good for the NES and the character animation  is well detailed.  But the controls are delayed beyond belief.  Did I just die by walking into the f***ing door?  Yeah.  Everything kills you.  Literally.  Everything.  Even if you stop to jump, you end up falling through the bridge.  Okay.  I'm going to try to kill this bat. 
[04:36:30]  And there I go.  Dead.  What the f***?  Why can't I duck?  I just want to duck down and throw my daggers at the dragon.  But no, it doesn't let you duck.  Have you ever played a game where the basic controls differ depending on which side of  the screen you're standing on?  Is that true?  This game.  It's completely different from the arcade version.  The arcade was laser disc based.  It was a cartoon, basically.  It was kind of like, depending on what decisions you make. 
[04:37:00]  It turns out a different way.  Well, obviously, you couldn't put that on Nintendo.  It couldn't handle that.  So they made it this shitty side-scroller that was just an abomination.  That game sucked in the arcade.  People were all psyched about it because it looked great for the time because it was  a cartoon.  Right.  It was a cartoon.  And it was a time where you walked into the arcade and it was that game next to things  like Galaga and Ms. Pac-Man.  Space Invaders. 
[04:37:30]  So you'd look at it and go, wow, that looks great.  But all you were really doing is, he would do something.  They'd show a cartoon clip and it was a video.  And then he'd kind of stop and you'd have to click on a right door or straight ahead or  a left door.  And there he would go.  Yeah.  And it would be a whole other scene.  They were like cut scenes.  Sure.  You were directing cut scenes.  You had to memorize exactly what to do and keep throwing quarters in because there was 
[04:38:00]  no rhyme or reason to whether down saved your life or left saved your life.  No.  No.  So, yeah, you would just have to make a decision and then you had a one in four chance of getting  it right.  Game sucked ass.  All right.  Let's play some more of this.  And this is bleeped because I thought we were going to get to it on the other side.  Oh, that's why someone's saying much funnier if it's not bleeped.  Yeah, I didn't think so.  We thought we were going to play it over there.  Sorry.  Our fault.  Another problem is that the dragon doesn't come up high enough to be able to hit with 
[04:38:30]  your dagger unless you're squatting.  But when you're squatting, the dragon stays below the bridge.  It literally reacts to your every move.  So, what do you do?  Do you stand?  Do you duck?  Either way, you're f***ing.  The decisions to make in this game are similar to if, say you're standing in a pool full  of f*** all the way up to your neck.  Then somebody comes in with a bucket full of f*** to dump on your head.  Do you duck down under the f*** or do you just stay up and take on the f***?  This game is like a cruel joke that you play on your friends. 
[04:39:00]  It's like, hey, you want to play a game?  Here you go.  You f***.  That was a swing pool full of piss.  And then the bucket of f***.  Do you go under in the piss?  Everyone's screaming about the beefs.  We really thought we were playing on the first half of the show.  We know, we know, we know.  Give us one break, will ya?  You know what else is bull****?  Everything kills you with only one hit.  The dragon, the fireball, the moat, the door.  But the bat just takes away a tiny bit of life from your life bar. 
[04:39:30]  Yeah, that's right.  You have a life bar.  I didn't even notice.  But what's the point?  Because everything that hits you, it kills you instantly.  Billy, I can guarantee that the only way you're going to die from this bat is if you stand absolutely still and just wait.  I've clocked it.  It takes one minute and 13 seconds for this bat to drain your energy.  That's 11 hits.  By the way, unfortunately I don't have my voice to do this right, but Joe T, hopefully my voice will be back soon. 
[04:40:00]  Joe T from Detroit, he lingers longer.  He writes, dude, what the f***?  They're censoring XM.  Copy, paste, copy, paste.  Blind CC, blind CC, blind CC.  Fucking Joe T, you rock.  And finally, one more clip.  We're going to get him on the phone, right?  We're going to get him on the phone right now?  Cool.  God damn it, man.  We f*** this game, man.  Jesus Christ.  I'd rather f*** a grizzly bear while shoving King Kong up my f***. 
[04:40:30]  I'd rather f*** stand in the middle of a ring of monkeys as they pelt me to death with their own f***.  Man, f*** this game.  F*** to hell.  Living f*** the damn nation of mankind.  Well, I was really playing on the fact that it would be played on the other side.  Yeah, you were adding a few of your own bleeps.  Well, no, I was just picking choice cuts.  Going inside the radio a little bit.  Going inside the show.  Anybody who wanted to know, he would rather 69 a grizzly bear and shove King Kong up his ass. 
[04:41:00]  Oh, what is that?  That's the game.  That's the game?  Oh, look how awful it is.  What a faggot dragon.  It's breathing f***ing smoke in the wrong direction.  And look at this stupid controller.  You forget how dumb that Nintendo controller was.  My God, did games suck.  What the hell were we doing?  Yeah, this episode is quite long.  It goes on for like 13 minutes.  But he goes on to explain that this opening scene is so ridiculously hard.  And it's only the first screen. 
[04:41:30]  What's so hard about it?  Just getting across the drawbridge.  Yeah, because the controls are so awkward.  And it just, everything takes so much time to respond.  And it's just a terrible game.  It's just, it was just another excuse for these game companies to rip off the kids who  actually, you know, kind of like the original game from the arcade.  The door kills them.  So, you know, they get their parents to, you know, plop down 50, 60 bucks on a game that  they think is going to be like the arcade.  And then they come home, you know, plop it in their Nintendo.  And this is what they get.  Yeah.  And the dragon, like you said, if you duck the track, the dragon ducks out of you. 
[04:42:00]  And then when you stand up, he kills you.  Oh my God.  That sucks.  Toby and Anthony.  He's going to take you back to the past.  To play some shitty games that suck ass.  He'd rather have a buffalo.  Take your time to read and jump in the air.  He'd rather be a rotten asshole. 
[04:42:30]  Over all your stunk and down it with beer.  Is it angry, you gave me a bad word?  Is it angry, you turned golden?  Is it angry, you turned second?  Is it angry, you gave me a video game?  Ah!  We got angry video game nerd on the phone.  Angry game video nerd, how are you?  Hey, how are you? 
[04:43:00]  It's Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and a bunch of other guys.  How are you?  I said that already.  I'm pretty good.  Good, good.  Yeah.  Watched some of your work.  I loved it.  I mean, it's nostalgic, brings back memories of playing some of these shitty games.  And you got quite the take on it.  It's not just like you're reviewing these things, but you're kind of passionate about it.  Yeah, you got a great way about you as you do this.  Yeah. 
[04:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah.  So what?  You played these shitty games when you were younger?  Yeah.  And decided you were going to just put them up there and talk about how crappy they were.  Yeah.  Like the first one I did, it was just some little joke.  And I, you know, just some stupid thing I did.  And, you know, I thought it was just funny.  Like the whole joke was like, who would care about all these old games?  And little did I know, I gained this huge following and everybody was like, this is hilarious. 
[04:44:00]  You got to do more.  And so I start doing more and more and more.  And then I start finding all these games I never even heard of.  And then, you know, learning about them as I'm reviewing them.  And it's been fun.  What was the first game you reviewed?  The first one was Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.  It was actually a classic game.  You know, it's in the Castlevania franchise.  But there was just lots of flaws in it, lots of things that were just, you know, really weird. 
[04:44:30]  So it was a, you know, it was a good one to start with.  My favorite was probably Top Gun was really a good one.  You ripped the shit out of that one.  Yeah.  My favorite thing about the Top Gun one, I was watching some of these last night.  And I was taking a look at the Power Glove one that you reviewed.  Yeah.  And the best part about the Power Glove one is that he's playing, the thing was impossible to use.  But he's playing Top Gun. 
[04:45:00]  What was the Power Glove?  It was this awful, you know, to be perfectly honest, it really, it really reminds me of what the Wii is now.  It was basically this just, you know, infrared sensor that you'd wear on your hand and try to control the game with this shitty glove.  And he actually landed the plane in Top Gun with the fucking Power Glove.  Yeah, yeah, after he couldn't land it with the controller ever.  It was just impossible to land that fucking plane on the carrier.  And also, Back to the Future was another great one.  The dumbest friggin' additions in that game that had nothing to do with the movie. 
[04:45:30]  Yeah.  Like, you know, most of the games I do are NES games or movie-based games.  Yeah.  And a lot of times it's fun to compare the movies with the games, and it's like, where did they come up with these ideas?  The bowling balls.  Yeah, bowling balls.  It's like, what the hell does that have to do?  Now, what are you playing now? 
[04:46:00]  Do you actually play games now?  Like, new games?  I try to, but now I'm too occupied with just playing crappy games.  It would be nice to play some good games here and there.  Well, yeah, I play some Wii games.  Like, I've been, I played, like, the new Zelda Twilight Princess.  Jeez.  You know, but, and now I've sort of become a collector, so I have the old, I have the Intellivision, ColecoVision, Atari 2600 and all that. 
[04:46:30]  Yeah, you've had to, like, get all these platforms and the games themselves.  Where do you find this shit?  Yeah, a lot of times, sometimes it's eBay, and I have a PayPal donation on my site, so people donate.  And some people actually donate directly, like, I give out a P.O. box address on request, so some people have actually sent me games.  And so I get, like, lots of stuff in the mail.  I get, like, stuff I never heard of.  I get, like, I got, like, I once mentioned in a video that I didn't have a Sega Saturn, and next thing I got four of them in the mail. 
[04:47:00]  Of course you did.  They've been sitting in a box for the last ten years in an attic.  It's no surprise.  That thing sucked.  I got the Sega Genesis and then the add-on, the 32X.  Yeah, yeah.  Sega CD?  The Sega CD.  And, oh, was that awful.  Yeah.  They made it look like it was going to be so cool.  There was that one game where you went into the sewers, you know, and you're kind of racing around. 
[04:47:30]  And it just turned into a turn right, turn left.  Yeah.  It's, like, pushed, you know, when the arrows appear.  Yeah, the arrows appeared, and you had to push the button near the arrow, and then it would turn, and turn into another, what amounted to a cut scene.  Like another Dragon's Lair.  Yeah, another Dragon's Lair.  Bullshit.  And you've played a lot of these old video games by now.  Which is the worst one so far?  Oh, man.  Well, my second review was Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  I think I still stand by that, that that really is one of the worst games I've ever played. 
[04:48:00]  Because back then, you don't really, like, you know, take into account how bad they are.  You just, you know, you play them, and that's really all there was.  But Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I remember, even back then, was bad.  And if it was bad back then, it's bad.  What was bad about it?  It doesn't really make any sense, basically.  You're just walking, and then all of a sudden, lightning strikes, and you're dead.  And that's it.  That's pretty much the game.  You put it in for, like, ten seconds, and you're done. 
[04:48:30]  But what are you supposed to do?  I've never really, I think, there are, like, explanations.  Like, some people have actually found out, like, what you're supposed to do.  And you can read all about it, you know, on the internet.  Back then, no one cared about, like, what the games were about.  They just wanted to pump out games, and they were awful.  None of them really made much sense.  Well, it was the cool factor that you could actually do this at home.  So it didn't really matter. 
[04:49:00]  They didn't really have to put a lot of thought into the actual game.  Because remember, there's a lot of us out there that remember playing Pong  and thinking that was the coolest thing ever.  Yeah.  Well, it was for a little while.  You go from Pong to some of these other games that had no point.  They look cool as hell, and that's all that mattered.  I like the franchises that are still out there, and you compare the two,  like Microsoft Flight Simulator.  It looks hysterical in its first generation.  The frame rate was ridiculous.  You'd go to turn the plane, and it wouldn't turn, so you'd keep the joystick over. 
[04:49:30]  And then you realize it's going to turn, like, five seconds later, and you're upside down.  And then you try to turn it back.  And now you look now at the new Flight Simulator for Microsoft, and it's just the graphics are amazing.  It looks photorealistic.  But, yeah, that franchise just kept going, and actually, I remember playing that first one, though,  and thinking, oh, this is so cool.  It's really like flying a plane. 
[04:50:00]  And now you look back on it.  What was I thinking?  Yeah, and it's a joke.  Yeah.  And the other thing I want to mention, you also review the porn games.  There was a time where the porn games became pretty hot.  There were a lot of them out there.  What do you have to say about that?  Well, Atari 2600 was an interesting case.  I mean, it was, like, the console that put, you know, games in, like, the pop culture, you know.  But they were just, well, for one thing, there was just an endless supply of games on Atari 
[04:50:30]  because Atari didn't need to approve any of the games that were made for it,  that, like, anybody could just make an Atari game and sell it.  That's hysterical.  Yeah, like, today, people are still making, like, homemade Atari games here and there.  But back then, like, there would just be all this ridiculous stuff, like all these porn games.  And, like, there was, like, the horror games.  Like, there was, like, Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. 
[04:51:00]  And you see, like, a head get decapitated, and there's, like, little pixelated blood comes out.  And back then, that was, like, that was shocking.  That was, like, you know, unheard of.  So, like, they wouldn't be able to sell it, and they'd have to, like, take it off the shelves  and, like, only give it out, like, on a request basis.  Like, people come in and ask for it.  Like, they have to hit the counter.  Yeah, I saw that Halloween review that you did, and the game was so homemade that they  didn't even have art, like, for a sticker to put on a console, to put on the cartridge  itself.  So, it was just, like, a peel-off sticker, and someone wrote with, like, marker, Halloween. 
[04:51:30]  Like, they ran out of labels, so they actually wrote on it with a marker.  The funny one was, what was it, the Indian raping, no, the cowboy raping?  Oh, the Custer's, Custer's.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You had to rape the Indian squaw.  Right.  And there was, what, sperm flying from the sky or something?  Against a cactus.  Against a cactus, right.  That one was hilarious.  Yeah, the jizz eater one, I can't remember the name of it.  Oh, yeah, where you're, like, beat him and eat him. 
[04:52:00]  Beat him and eat him, right.  Yeah, it was like jizz was shooting out.  Yeah.  And there was the other version.  Yeah, they catch the jizz.  Yeah, there was the other one where the whore was squirting titty milk off of the building.  Oh, that's right.  You had to avoid the titty milk.  It was the same game with the gender reversed.  And they were the most deceiving boxes ever.  Because on the outside of the box, it looked so cool that you wanted to play it. 
[04:52:30]  And then you'd play the game and realize it was some side-scrolling, like, just piece of shit.  And they would always make these ridiculous claims on the box that you would know.  Like, where were they getting it from?  Like, in one of James' reviews for Rocky for the Sega Master System, it says on the cover,  it just says, double the mega power.  And you're like, oh, what?  Double the mega power.  What?  Of Rocky?  What does that mean? 
[04:53:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  I never found out the answer to that one.  Oh, man.  James, are you ever going to review one of my favorite consoles of all time, the TurboGrafx-16?  What?  Oh, absolutely, yeah.  What is that?  I don't know which game, though, but I don't know.  Well, they were all pretty terrible, so I think anyone you've played.  Well, yeah, it was one of the first 16-bit consoles, so I remember when it came out,  you know, I wanted to be cooler than all my friends, and I screamed.  I was like, you know, Dad, I've got to have a TurboGrafx-16.  The ads were all, you know, in every magazine.  They all look so cool.  And I finally got it for, I think, my birthday that year, and it was the shittiest console ever. 
[04:53:30]  It was so disappointing when you would get a shitty game.  You know what was cool about it, though, was that they had, like, the games were, like,  on these little, like, memory cards sort of things, so they were, like, you know,  they weren't, like, cartridges and they weren't CDs.  They were just these little cards, and you could just, you know, like, you can store a lot of them  because they're so small.  Yeah, it's kind of like a giant memory stick sort of thing.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I had the Atari, what was it, the 800 computer. 
[04:54:00]  And I played Star Raiders.  That one was a cool game back in, like, the early 80s.  Oof.  Yeah.  I played Star Raiders.  It was, yeah, it looked really cool, and they didn't have to do much, just make a star field,  so that didn't take much as far as graphics go.  And it was kind of a first-person thing, which was pretty cool.  Mm-hmm.  Aside from looking at side-scrolling, like, fucking pixels.  Oh, side-scrolling sucked. 
[04:54:30]  I was at Atari.  I've never had any of the Atari computers.  They have the Atari Jaguar, which was, like, one of their last efforts.  Yeah, the Jaguar.  I was old-school Atari, and you had to become an electrician to play the games  because the stupid joystick would break so many times.  You'd replace it, and then that got expensive, so you start taking the thing apart  and try to, you know, fix it yourself.  I'd just stick a pen in there.  If the thing broke up, you'd stick a pen in there. 
[04:55:00]  Now, this is more breaking the connection, so, like, all of a sudden you can't go right anymore,  so then you're like, you're a kid, you're like, ah, maybe I could, like, beat the game by not going right.  I don't know.  I'll try to figure this out.  I remember my uncle had ColecoVision, and, like, that was, like, one of the first video game consoles I was exposed to.  I remember the joystick, it looked like a cell phone.  Like, it had all these buttons.  There was a pound sign on it, and I'd never played a game where I had to use the fucking pound sign.  And I, to this day, I still have no idea what you'd use those buttons for. 
[04:55:30]  Yeah.  Sometimes it was hard just to get the game to start on, like, the ColecoVision,  because you're supposed to hit some number combination or something.  I don't know.  All right.  What's that?  Hey, Chad from Jersey writes, ask him about the Bible games he reviewed.  Are there Bible games out there?  Yeah.  Actually, it was kind of the same deal with, well, you know how, like, you know, third-party software,  you know, companies would start making games for a system, but, like, you know, for Atari,  like, they did all the porn games, but Nintendo had more of a, like, you know, 
[04:56:00]  would put their foot down on that sort of thing.  But there was still a company called Color Dreams.  I think they changed it to Wisdom Tree.  And they were making all these, like, Christian games, but they were, like, illegal  because they were being made for the Nintendo and they weren't supposed to be.  So they made all these Bible games, and there was, like,  there's Bible Adventures, which has, like, three games in it.  And there's one is, it's like Noah, and you're just, like, carrying the animals to the ark. 
[04:56:30]  And then there's one where you're, like, trying to carry baby Moses.  And then, oh, the most ridiculous thing of all was, you remember Wolfenstein, like, you know,  with the first-person shooter game?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they took that, they took the same engine for that game,  and they made a Noah game out of it on the Super Nintendo.  It's called Super Noah's Ark 3D.  And you're basically Noah going around in an ark just shooting a bunch of goats. 
[04:57:00]  And it's weird because, like, wasn't Noah supposed to bring, like, two of each animal?  Like, why?  No.  Like, a whole bunch of murdered goats.  That's ridiculous.  That's so ridiculous.  And I like that the production value of your reviews have really stepped up in some of the more recent months.  Have you gotten sponsored by game trailers?  Yeah.  But, yeah, I mean, the first ones, like, I was, you know, just sort of one thing I do. 
[04:57:30]  Like, you know, I'm a movie buff and, you know, indie filmmaker.  But that was just, like, one little thing I did as a joke.  But since then, as this thing has just kept getting more and more popular, I've been putting more into them.  But I also do them really quickly.  Like, I pretty much, on average, put one out every two weeks.  Wow.  So I do them really quickly.  But as much as I can with the time, I definitely try to step it up as much as I can.  You got a regular job?  Yeah.  I mean, it's all kind of, like, all freelance stuff. 
[04:58:00]  So I just do a bunch of different things.  I'm an editor for dvideography.com.  And I have a DVD out.  So you can buy the Angry Nerd DVD at screwattack.com.  At what.com?  Screwattack.com.  Screwattack.  Yeah.  Okay.  And your website is cinemassacre.com, correct?  Yeah.  My personal site is cinemassacre.com.  That's Cinema and Massacre put together. 
[04:58:30]  You can watch all the videos on gametrailers.com.  And you can see the Nerd site at angryvgnerd.com.  And that's where you can see an updated list of all the Nerd videos.  Now, are you still the ninth most subscribed video channel on YouTube?  It's at eight now.  Nice.  Oh, hey, look at that.  You found a nice niche for yourself.  You certainly did.  All right.  Well, we've been meaning to talk to you for a while because your videos have definitely been entertaining all of us. 
[04:59:00]  Oh, it's awesome, yeah.  You play Call of Duty?  Call of Duty?  No, I actually played a little bit.  But no, I haven't really gotten into that much yet.  It rocks.  You should try to, like, review some of the newer games just for a goof.  Oh, yeah.  And try to find something ridiculous about them.  Oh, there are some bad ones out there.  Or we might have to wait 20 years and then they'll look ridiculous.  Yeah, like in the Christmas cattle video I just did, it's like I do, like, the three ghosts, the Christmas past and all that. 
[04:59:30]  And I go to the future and I'm an old man playing the Wii.  So maybe when that actually happens, I'll really start doing it.  If I'm still doing this thing, then.  The Wii.  Very good.  All right, man.  Well, thanks for calling our show today, sir.  All right.  Thanks for having me.  And continued success, plug one of the many websites one more time.  Which one do you want to plug the most?  Which one I want to plug?  Oh, gee.  Well, I guess watch the videos on Game Trailers. 
[05:00:00]  Game Trailers.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, James.  Thank you so much.  Continued success for you.  Okay.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  There he goes, James.  The angry video game nerd.  He's into his video games, you know.  What's wrong?  Just saying.  Into his video games. 
[05:00:30]  Not the most talkative guy when he's not on the...  I had a feeling that was going to happen, too, because every time I had to talk to him  on the phone, I would try to have a dialogue and he would just be like, okay.  Danny really piggybacked that one, I gotta say.  Like, when he talks on his reviews, he's really, you know, he's going at it.  Very animated.  Yeah, that's what was so surprising to me, because, you know, he's so outgoing and, you  know, creative with these videos, you figured he would just be able to spew out anything  there without a problem.  Then you get on the phone.  He's like, so, yeah, the video game, and you reviewed that one, and it was pretty slow-moving 
[05:01:00]  as a...  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, at least he wasn't, you know, confrontational.  Yeah, yeah, that would have been a little awkward.  When you're a radio host and you ask a pretty involved question and the answer is yeah, it  puts you in a weird position.  Because, like, you need a little more time to think up the next question.  Right.  So when you just get a yeah, you kind of go, oh, oh, I should have had another question.  He's still like James.  He might have been a little nervous. 
[05:01:30]  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to check out some of his...  Because I know he's done other interviews, you know, with, like, websites and stuff like  that.  But I think he might have just been intimidated because of the show.  Oh, no.  I mean, he's a fan.  Oh.  All right.  Very good.  This is the Angry Video Game Nerd.  And you just heard them listening to my shitty game reviews on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The show that kicks your balls up your ass till you cry for more.  Yeah, you can check out all my stuff at cinemassacre.com.
