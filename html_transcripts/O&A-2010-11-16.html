<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, shifting rapidly between planned segments and impromptu discussions.  The show opened with discussions about Sarah Palin and her daughter's appearance on *Dancing with the Stars*,  intertwined with commentary on Palin's political career and her daughter's physical appearance. This transitioned into a discussion of Michael Vick's impressive NFL performance, juxtaposed with his prior dogfighting conviction.  A significant portion focused on the New York Islanders' struggles, the firing of their coach, and the hosts' own passionate (and often cynical) observations as long-time fans.  The Yankees' rising ticket prices were also briefly lamented.

The show further explored the then-recent availability of Beatles music on iTunes, sparking a broader discussion about music distribution, the absence of certain artists like AC/DC and Kid Rock, and the business decisions behind these choices.  A darkly humorous tangent emerged involving the deaths of the hosts' grandparents, leading to a conversation about aging and mortality.  A producer's awkward encounter with Joy Behar and subsequent email correspondence was recounted, followed by a bizarre anecdote about one of the hosts dreaming of throwing a bag of shit onto an ice hockey rink.  Roland, a producer, shared a frustrating story about his unsuccessful attempt to get a photo with Bruce Springsteen at a Sirius XM event, highlighting perceived management incompetence and fueling further complaints about SiriusXM's policies. Ed Asner's opinion on 9/11 was briefly mentioned.  The hosts also expressed their frustrations with SiriusXM's perceived resistance to podcasts and their ambitions in that area.

The hosts' anger towards SiriusXM management continued, with Opie venting about arbitrary decisions, including the Springsteen photo incident and the blocking of his podcast initiatives.  This led to a discussion about internet sensations like Double Rainbow Guy and Antoine Dodson, prompting speculation about creating a viral video. This segued into promotion of Jimmy Norton's upcoming comedy show, "The Antisocial Network," featuring Bill Burr, Jim Breuer, and Dave Attell, accompanied by criticism of the show's poorly designed billboard artwork.  Jim Sturgis, an actor promoting his new film *Heartless*, joined the show, discussing the film's plot (a Faustian bargain involving a man with a birthmark), his experiences on set (including a miserable time living in a cramped trailer during *Furry Vengeance*), and his singing roles in *Heartless* and *Across the Universe*, including meeting Ringo Starr.  The conversation veered into discussions about port wine stains, knife crime versus gun crime, and the dangers faced by police officers in different countries. Jim Norton frequently interjected, sharing anecdotes about his own acting career and physique.

Pat Cooper, a comedian and author, joined the show to promote his book, *How Dare You Say How Dare Me*.  His appearance was marked by frequent profanity and rambling anecdotes, encompassing topics ranging from bodily functions and eating habits to his career, interactions with numerous celebrities (George Burns, Tony Martin, Jerry Vale, Tony Bennett, Robert De Niro, and Frank Sinatra), and experiences with the Mafia, including money disputes, threats, and witnessing violence.  He also discussed his book, audiobook, upcoming book signings, his personal life (including his late wife), aging, and mortality.  In a later segment, Cooper's interview continued with further complaints about perceived disrespect from the comedy industry, boasting about his ability to "bomb" on stage, sharing highly profane stories about his childhood and father, and making a bizarre comment about an unsolved murder mentioned in his book.  The interview concluded abruptly with Cooper's angry dismissal of the hosts, leaving them exhausted and ultimately prompting the cancellation of a scheduled meeting. The hosts briefly discussed their upcoming Borgata show and reflected on Cooper's personality and the interview.

[00:18:00]  throw the octopus on the ice in detroit is it what what would happen would i just spend one night in  jail that'd be worth it more nights yeah throwing shit is probably a health hazard public health hazard  what if it's in a baggie might be they arrest you for i actually had a dream about this i'm a baggie  of shit i'm i'm working out in my head how i could get away with this what was your dream uh that i  threw a bag of shit on the ice in a baggie i'm not even joking i know you're not it has nothing to  do with hockey by the way you dream no no that's what let's analyze that dream uh throwing a bag of 
[00:18:30]  shit let's see the ice represents management yeah exactly um shit represents privacy and throwing  your privacy out i don't know oh it represents something i'm a sports fan no one no one dreams  about throwing duty on ice in front of an arena full of people i just i just want it to hurt it  was after one player scored three goals and everyone's got shit on their head and they just  throw it onto the ice a shit trick you don't have to analyze this i just want it to hurt yeah  because i mean anyone could throw anything on the ice you could throw your your plastic 
[00:19:00]  fucking beer bottle on the ice they just pick it up who cares but a bag of shit makes it hurt they  actually have to stop the gate everyone's confused as they're scraping the shit that's remaining  off the ice i believe that is uh fecal matter that has been tossed on the ice hope this doesn't  become a trend yeah especially if they leave it there the uh the ice it's gonna it's gonna begin to  uh crystallize and crystallize fecal matter could get uh caught up in cause reticulitis that's if it 
[00:19:30]  gets caught in your skin cells called sarcoma  you're having some seepage seepage so you had a baggie with some ice and you and bag with shit  and you just threw it on the ice oh yeah i want i want it i want everyone to be very confused by what  happened like they have to explain it that'd be great something was thrown on the ice and just  makes a thin layer of shit over the entire rink i've fucking had it man yeah long time suffering 
[00:20:00]  fan just watching this team as jimmy said earlier fade away it's just slowly fading away with a shitty  owner a fucking guy that never should have been the gm to begin with an old goalie that went out  with jill nicolini is fucking the gm of the islanders no experience in that field whatsoever  and then they do have a pretty good coach and they're fucking uh firing him because the team  just isn't uh doing anything this year no it's ridiculous the worst though when a team just mails 
[00:20:30]  it in you're like what the fuck well i know the guy i mean the the team is young and they're they're  skating hard but it's the organization it's not the player's fault and it's just pretty much done  now for the whole season like they're not going to do anything that's going to re-energize the fans  and make them show up every they're not going to play to an empty fucking arena every year i get a  stack of tickets for the for the year right and with all the horseshit that's been going on i looked  i i opened up my desk and i pulled out my stack islander tickets i'm like there's way too many games 
[00:21:00]  left for this season to be over yeah if you had maybe a thin a thin pile left yeah you'd be like  ah whatever it was it was a good year i got to bring people to the game it was fun  this stack is so thick and i know the season's over you have a giant loser stack it's a complete  waste of time fuck it was don maloney anthony and uh i don't know this guy oh don maloney and hedberg  mitch mitch hedberg was actually he was a ranger before he went into i used to play hockey i still do 
[00:21:30]  but i used to too that's a funny joke i used to do drugs i still do but i used to but i used to too  that son of a bitch was funny yeah funny guy man what a creative funny fucking joke that i never  would have thought of was it johan johan hedberg andres or andre i don't know it's eric from ohio  what does he know andres or andre if it's not johan you're you're bounced i don't i don't know 
[00:22:00]  this guy's saying hold on of course why don't we just ask this fuck uh serge and basher what's up  what's up guys pretty good brother yeah it was andres hedberg him and oaf nielsen came in at the  same time they were like one of the first two foreigners coming to the country and playing in  the nhl because the nhl years ago was all canadians and half canadians and half americans and then  you never heard of the russians coming in and then all of a sudden no we didn't want them so he was  one of the first foreign players obviously outside canada well one of them i mean uh obviously that 
[00:22:30]  borje salming who played defense for the toronto maple leaves back then but a lot of the times  you knew the player's name now you can't even identify with the players that's another big problem  with that you don't know how to freaking say the guy's name my favorite part of of going to a hockey  game let's say the islanders play the canadians and it's a home game so it's on u.s soil it's at  the nassau coliseum it's the islanders home rink and they they play the canadian national anthem and  the entire place booze and i sit there like you idiot every fucking player you're just insulting 
[00:23:00]  every player including your guys on your own team half your team is like you know has the pride of  listening to their national anthem yeah right right and with montreal you got to figure the canadians  are like the yankees of hockey i mean they wanted so many cups yeah that's why you know they're they're  in a different realm but the worst i gotta tell you you know opie you're a big islander fan  worst four years of my life was 9th 10th 11th and 12th grade as a new york ranger fan the alders won  the cup every freaking year and i had to deal with that that was a great little dynasty they had 
[00:23:30]  you do realize that's 25 years ago now right is it i thought it was longer oh well once we won our cup  the rangers in 94 i could care less now i'm fine i don't care yeah but 90 think of that the rangers  it feels i know the rangers it feels like yesterday the rangers won the stanley cup that's already  what 16 years ago yeah i know holy shit i still remember there was this guy john who was a big fan of  otto and george he used to come to all the gigs and he was a massive ranger fan that's how long 
[00:24:00]  that's how long ago that was wow 16 years ago i remember otto telling me how happy john was that  uh the uh the rangers won that he cried because he was he had he hadn't wanted so many years  i can't believe that was fucking 16 years ago what how they went 50 years or something without a cup  yeah but anthony i'm surprised you're not a big hockey fan with but with the uh the discoloration  in the sport there's not many of them yeah it's a very white sport is that the reason you should get  into it for me enjoying a sport you should get into it it's always the reason why you know the blacks 
[00:24:30]  don't like it is because the black thing's the only thing getting hit in that game you know  what's that sir yeah i was sorry what was that i didn't hear you jimmy was on his laptop  no i'm not going for that  yeah not last night boys all right guys punch it out oh god what was that again  i was born at night but not last night sir that's even worse than actually doing it turnip truck  what this guy's got a million of them yeah he was a hoot what's wrong with this guy 
[00:25:00]  how do you know you were born at night you fell out it was just vagina and placenta windows on the  windows it's the operating room lights what do you think the doctor did put his timex on you  you don't know when you were born it's probably born early morning but it wouldn't sound right  he's sure it wasn't last night i was born early morning but who would think it was last night  yeah born at night but not last night oh uncle paul i've never talked to it i've never talked  to an 11 hour old thing you wouldn't know about hockey no all right enough about the dumb hockey 
[00:25:30]  obviously that doesn't go a long way hey uh apple big announcement finally uh what carrying the  beatles yeah yeah itunes i guess you're gonna be able to download the beatles the beatles do they  have some kind of clever apple beatles thing happening yeah i'm sure i'm sure the stock will  fucking skyrocket today because of this what was the hold up on that yoko needed more money or  something i don't know if it was a yoko or uh they're waiting to see if if making a deal they 
[00:26:00]  were waiting to see if digital downloads was going to be a thing or something probably some kind of  negotiation could be publishers too it's always weird shit with that stuff yeah acdc is still not  we were to be and my manager talking about that it's a terrible move because they're really  antiquated when it comes to being online it's like i guess they don't want to get ripped off  or they want to control it or make all the money but it's like when you want something bad enough  i'm willing to buy it but if you can't get it people today can go out and just steal it it's so 
[00:26:30]  easy because uh my friend has a copy of thunderstruck it's an example and he goes dude i wanted to buy  this i wanted to buy the song but they're not on itunes so i just went and got it off lamware  that's what people do why aren't they just on because they're dumb they probably think they're  gonna make why weren't the beatles on at before now you do make money right yeah i don't know  maybe somebody knows i don't it's gotta be huh they gotta fucking make cash on it yeah but so  so now you can finally get beatles songs they should have been getting beatles songs for the 
[00:27:00]  last 10 years what do you know on this travis uh i just know that ever since you know digital music  has been around emi who owns uh the beatles catalog has been trying to figure out something  with apple but you know apple and the way that steve jobs works they they want what they want you  know and i'm sure emi and paul mccartney and ringo star now they want what they want so it's just been  kind of like 10 years john and george well yeah i mean you know yoko and george harrison's put the 
[00:27:30]  they have to put the pen in their little skeleton fingers have them sign who gets george's money  george gets pudding all over the contract his wife i think from his head get it i didn't but  i'm glad you're terrified so it's just been like 10 years of i wonder who won that battle  i don't know what do you mean meaning did they got what they wanted one of them must have been  obviously won you think maybe the money i don't know steve jobs he don't take no guff well they  don't need the money but their record label needs the money the beatles won come on they held out 
[00:28:00]  until they got a deal they were very happy with but who cares that's my that's my guess without  itunes by the way the beatles are still the biggest selling artists of the decade right eminem  was second since 2000 the beatles were the biggest selling of the decade it's just amazing  they haven't even been a band for 40 fucking years yeah about 40 years yeah so what do you think who do  you think won i could actually find out i could ask somebody who knows i would bet money i would 
[00:28:30]  bet money the beatles you know people that know the probably the beatles because the beatles in  the end need itunes less than yeah itunes needs exactly this is a big win for apple so wait the  beatles needs itunes less yeah way less they don't need itunes to sell records they sell fucking huge  like you just said if you if you're doing numbers like that on the news look every time we talk about  something it pops up on the news uh amazing you think they're listening yes rampant speculation  what's the speculation it's not confirmed it's morning so it's oh oh oh there's an announcement 
[00:29:00]  how about the news announces it you dopes plus apple will re-release me the beatles will re-release  their fucking cat they just re-release their cattle i went out and bought one last year i bought it  too but you know how many people download that shit yes i do actually i have figures  hey what other bands aren't on itunes acdc's not on itunes acdc's not um ace of bass  no i don't know actually i know that i know acdc we were both amazed at what a bad move that is 
[00:29:30]  because i wanted to buy all i wanted to buy acdc's catalog base i would have bought everything they  had i was in an acdc mood how great is it's like the who the i do i don't love the who as you know but  i had that craving like those couple days i just went and bought fucking fucking 70 who songs oh  shit wow a bunch of albums what's your favorite who's who knows i didn't listen to them you like  they didn't they didn't do yeah the one you were playing that you used to think applied to you oh  blue eyes it's a good tune though so that may be behind blue eyes yeah i can just picture you 
[00:30:00]  walking with the wind in your hair thinking that favorite but it's a good tune so i went and bought  baby buy buy you check out naked eye yet well i'm probably sure i did a little more obscure but  cool song but i mean i never would have went out and actually just bought them what about eminence front  yeah it was never a huge fan  with roger d playing guitar on that one roger d real hard to go see him live next year the who  yeah they retired uh decades ago no they're they're touring again next year i was there 
[00:30:30]  no i was at their with john antwistle's skeleton hands playing bass so you get it because he's dead  oh i was actually gonna go but i'm supposed to interview keith moon i don't know what's gonna  happen oh yeah should be a good interview how do you not like this song it's okay  the video was so cool because like the limo pulls backstage i don't remember and they're just getting  out of the limo when the song kicks in and then like roger daltry's just kind of walking backstage  it was just like they're rock stars they're motherfuckers yeah this is a great uh well they just 
[00:31:00]  looked like old vickers i think this was the last great who song too right yeah yeah what this one  did they come out with anything after this that people would know and like like just as much what  year is this 83 maybe rough boys early 80s that was a that was a that was a solo fucking song of course  it was by the faggot himself by uh mr townsend who was just doing research and who was the obnoxious  drummer they had uh was it uh oh fuck roger daltry uh jones man yeah yeah 
[00:31:30]  look at that who sound check how cool would that be to watch  there's right this is actually not a bad video it's just them actually walking yeah just fucking  setting up yeah they're not trying to get anything done they're just like hey this is us setting up  for a concert final tap play our stupid eminence front while we walk around i like the fact the  intro is i wish the intro is a little longer are they getting out young fucking pete townsend is  and why is he getting out of a shitty van looks so fucking young kenny's driving all right pete yeah 
[00:32:00]  this way yeah i have your lactate in the dressing room look at this guy pete just wants to punch  this guy in the face that walked up to him guys trying to give lyrical suggestions talking spitting  donut out at him yeah just all mad and that was like right when roger daltry cut his hair  so people are looking at him all right yeah oh fucking pete townsend is it's amazing how he  already was old over fucking night right he's not entwistle he looks like a kid well look if if you 
[00:32:30]  think they're gonna catch you for some things on your computer you'll you'll go gray overnight too  yeah that's true this is pretty internet how the fuck did he get away with the second computers were  made available to the public he turned gray overnight fuck i think i could get in trouble  looking over his back every night the second he realized you could trace things that were  actually file traded right oh boy i didn't know that he fucking went white must tell gary glitter to  stop fucking emailing me yeah the guys just keep sending me not the uh music and bitches and stuff 
[00:33:00]  that's a good impression that chip thanks oh dylan refuses to sign with apple as well yeah  stupid who cares i wonder if they what those radio hour on xm is great what do these guys watch show  i wonder if they just want to give up less of their money that apple wants  it also might have something to do with with changing times what year was the beatles you know 
[00:33:30]  they they resisted for a long time to put their stuff on cd dylan's dylan's aware it's probably a  tough negotiation but you know is what it comes down to you think that they know it's just how  big they are and it's like it's a big news story when they eventually do it like this is a huge news  story because it's taken 10 years 10 years to get them on they negotiated for 10 years around that  yeah i mean how long has itunes been out uh 11 okay so 11 years it really is a genius fucking thing i 
[00:34:00]  mean if you have a cd you just rip it in it like guys i already have all my beatles another band that's  not on itunes that bothers a lot of people yeah kid rock kid rock is he not on itunes  what is he thinking get your stupid songs on it what the fuck is that about you're you're not the  beatles you're kid rock you don't think it's gonna be a big announcement when kid rock sounds like no  travis is right though you just rip it into itunes the cds you have yeah you don't need to right like  for not putting new shit out it's not a big deal it's not no it's it's not hard it's hard 
[00:34:30]  we know keith moon was the drummer the who who was the guy afterwards oh my god dummy was it  kenny jones it was someone like kenny jones yeah he's got his fucking name yeah yeah that was their  last big hit though it was right yeah it was off their last studio album wow that's it that's how  they went out 20 and then they kind of just started putting out kind of mediocre shit after  that now there has to be one more no that was it they had you better you bet in 81 and that was 82 
[00:35:00]  huh you better you bet that was a good song you don't like that one better you bet it's not a good  one it's a little too poppy you better you better you bet that's okay can we hear a little you better  you better you bet bet i keep that one sex people yeah come on iraq if i fucking take back that  dead signed book i gave you and throw it oh there you go 
[00:35:30]  oh geez i can't even look at you yeah i can't even look at you  this is a little but then it starts maybe not this part with drums kick it in the drums do kick it in  yeah come on right no not really you're not digging on that no no better you bet here it  comes watch though it rocks right now very rocky horror yeah you know what this part is actually okay  yeah yeah see all right fade this i wasn't gonna lie to you keep playing hey uh did roland get his 
[00:36:00]  picture with bruce springsteen yesterday oh shit why not uh apparently it was very tight security  no why not god he's his biggest fan literally did he get did he get to go to see him though  uh he did go but the company didn't do the right thing and get a picture for him i do i heard other  people getting pictures so why didn't roland get a picture i'm also guessing that meant jimmy did  not get his picture signed oh i don't know here comes roland i don't know i think he's wearing a  bruce springsteen shirt today well of course he is he's an obsessed creep look at him what a ghoul 
[00:36:30]  why is it oh my god yeah i get roland's theme going  hey roland hi buddy how was springsteen last night uh it was awesome though he went in the fishbowl  and talked for two hours what he was at sirius xm obviously and you got to go yeah even though 
[00:37:00]  they talked for two hours yeah that's what he does say shut up what was he talking about  hits oh i'm sorry he's hissing at me where were you standing um um ross and uh bladder was very  nice they put me up close i was able to see him talk to march and everything did you were you outside  the fishbowl yeah that's that's you got a good view yeah that's nice they're blasting it super loud  they wouldn't even let you in the fishbowl with it was only contest winners though so i wish was  fine you just put them in the back you're a fucking guy you work here yeah then uh you just 
[00:37:30]  montez how do they treat the employees like shit were they say were they thinking that there's too  many bruce fans here and if they put you in that they would have to you know what are they gonna do  there was a lot of other people outside the fishbowl there's no but this  no but i was very happy i'm very happy right yeah yeah well and i'm gonna talk for you i  you don't have to say anything you're not your job's safe mine probably isn't because  the you got to do the right thing it's ridiculous roland is probably the biggest  bruce springsteen fan in the world we're not talking about oh here's a band we kind of like 
[00:38:00]  can i be in the fishbowl and kind of that you're talking about the the biggest uber fan you put him  in the back and no one's gonna notice in the end you make a special yeah probably just saw like  mark david chapman all over of course to keep him the fuck away well to be fair to everybody everybody  was dressed up nicely as the only one that had bruce on my t-shirt yeah bruce or bruce  i bet you he would be he a guy like bruce would be happy to see this guy of everybody else 
[00:38:30]  yeah but so they sort of took care of you you were outside the fishbowl  outside the fishbowl saw it and then yeah he only signed autographs and photos just for the winners  and then uh he was and they couldn't they couldn't sneak you in there and say here's another winner  uh bruce would have never known and no one would have cared and they would have taken care of  a hard-working employee no i know i understand that because secure was tithing for bruce they  wanted to have everything why did they just say that you were a hard-working blue-collar guy from  jersey because they have signed it maybe then you would have gone whoa whoa whoa i'll sign something 
[00:39:00]  because he's from jersey so you so you sort of saw him perform through the yeah eight well here  the 12-inch glass he just did like he strummed his guitar while he talked was that as close as you've  ever been to him like for like uh oh no he was doing something like that no at the comedy festival  and what did he what did he play as far as like popular hit shit goes nothing like that he played  nothing no it's just like he did wait wait wait wait he had a fucking guitar yes and for two hours 
[00:39:30]  he strummed it and and spoke well he did like someone goes isn't one of your songs has thunder road in  it twice that he played a few lines of it and that was like this he didn't play a fucking song  no he didn't play one fucking song no but it was awesome though no it wasn't awesome it was  because he talked about it's a cock tease what he should have played one song he should have  fucking played one goddamn song well i know was the east street band there no it was just him and a 
[00:40:00]  guitar which would have made it very special it would have been amazingly special if he would  have played something he was being interviewed right it was a big interview it's like a guitar well  they had some fan questions the fans asked a question into this tunnel of love and he could  have like strummed his guitar he can't do that one solo silly why because he doesn't do that one solo  but he can but he can he's bruce springsteen right you fucking adapt right you improvise you  fucking what was the longest he played for like 30 seconds uh probably 40 how annoying that he's there 
[00:40:30]  with a fucking guitar it's not doing what bruce springsteen should be doing well like for no one  wants to hear him talk when he's we started doing the promise land everybody got really quiet  then all of a sudden he goes what was that about uh what i did what was it about to promote his  boxing no no i get all that but what what is that about that he didn't want to play entire songs  i don't know there's something there it was it was an interview right it was a 
[00:41:00]  the films are hardcore fans man 20 20 people listen to an interview right then you don't have  a song well he always has an interview he strums it what a douche they were all set up for him to  play so and he's got the guitar you play a song yeah yeah i'm not talking about a a complete acoustic  set but figure out a song something that he could do acoustically you name it you're a fucking mr  springsteen what song would he be able to do this guy would go like like that that people would  know that he could just do solo with a guitar and his voice um born around he could do okay 
[00:41:30]  there you go gee no one knows that song he does that acoustically sometimes in concert see he could  have done it why wouldn't he but it's fine well the only funny part was when he was playing he  goes what's this song the promised land the day of march flipped to the book he couldn't find it  he goes ah never mind next question he doesn't even know the words of his songs well i think you just  it's like a reminder refresher what's wrong with him he's awesome no he's not that's not awesome 
[00:42:00]  that's a disappointment for everyone that was in that room were you disappointed or you were  fucking happy i was beyond happy to hear his stories hear his stories what what kind of stories  why don't you tell us a little story he told yesterday that is interesting and look at bruce  topless on the beach yeah while you tell it he said um his album's out today you can go buy it  oh great so he plugged his album why didn't he play one song from the album to get everyone pumped  um well he just talked about the darkness sessions how he wrote it when he was broke and how he met 
[00:42:30]  clarence how did he meet clarence um waiting tables so he told that story for the hundredth time  instead of playing an acoustic song but i remember that he told differently though this time why does  everything have to be so complicated you get bruce up here he's not going to play an acoustic song  you got the biggest bruce springsteen fan you can't do the right thing and completely take care of him  get a picture uh with him and bruce even though everyone else was getting pictures everything's so  complicated always he's not found tonight he's doing the promise that's a good song when i was 
[00:43:00]  writing born in the usa uh that one is like they got over like um thousands of requests of course  they do lauren lauren yeah but you're roland i know but lauren has control the tickets so  all he wants is a picture with bruce he'll get one i actually i texted my i love how you said  and my manager yeah but i heard back from me the one of them those ship bag no connected idiots 
[00:43:30]  i love how you say he'll get one his opportunity was yesterday it's gone and all they had to do down  the hall is go yeah you make believe you're a fan get in line no problem no one will ever know in the  end but they have to just micromanage everything and sort of take care of roland he hugged this  woman and he gave her a kiss i was like i'm not gay but i was jealous i was like i agree with half  of that did you get to see him outside the fishbowl yeah i got to see him outside the fishbowl he's  walking around how much were you dying when uh other people were getting pictures and you weren't allowed  yeah you weren't allowed because you worked for serious that's pretty much it that's why you 
[00:44:00]  aren't i wasn't sad it just my soul cried your soul cried his soul i understand you can't line  up employees every time someone's here i get that part of it but there's also the other side where  you're talking about a guy that is the biggest fan ever yeah yeah so you make little exceptions  right yeah do you think he saw you at all because he might you're a recognizable guy dude well yeah  well there's just like a lot of people basically like every time he stood every second they like 
[00:44:30]  troubled people to take a picture and autograph yeah then once he was done he signed the wall  do you gotta work overtime for free now that uh they took care of you last night  i don't know oh wait it's a shame he doesn't have a photo i wonder if the photo i've taken with bruce  yes that wasn't in the elevator no it didn't get signed i wasn't sure oh no  oh shit you couldn't even get that done for the poor motherfucker and no it was um it's just  like they only signed for the contest winners why how many contest winners and 21 why not hand 
[00:45:00]  the picture to a contest winner and go could you have that signed because they're like me they're  selfish pricks they just wanted their own things wait wait i gave i gave signing one thing per  contest winner it's nonsense it would have been so easy to give one of the contest winners and say  this is for jimmy norton just go up there not the contest winner but the contest winners had  like two things for him to sign well can i ask you something if if the company said just get in  line and make believe your listener no one would have noticed right who would have noticed in the 
[00:45:30]  end and so instead of 21 pictures they take 22 yeah and then take care of you yeah but i was happy  that they put me there that i think see bruce so yeah because that was even a struggle by the way  that was a lot of back and forth getting rolling to even watched watches his hero from behind the 12  inch glass yeah i'm very happy though to see him though i just wish uh we could go back to the  old days where everything wasn't so complicated i remember when uh so i have a photo with the guy  they they wouldn't and liam told me we probably can't do it it was not liam he tried he has to go up 
[00:46:00]  delay it it had nothing to do with him up the ladder yeah but i knew it wouldn't get done i'm not  surprised it didn't get done why because they were everything was stickered though they could have said  this is a guy he's one of our on-air guys right he runs the fucking springsteen channel for you  there's this way just say he's an on-air guy there's ways of getting things done if you want to really  take care of the people that work for you he's selling a fucking album they got a springsteen  channel on the fucking platform oh it's not past the fact that he didn't play the guy should be 
[00:46:30]  fucking like kissing ass to tell you the truth well the album box it's it's 120 for the dvd like 140 for  the blu-ray it's like an expensive box no shit yeah and and he they got a channel here where  they're promoting it and everything and he comes in doesn't play music doesn't let one of his like  biggest little fans uh meet him no that was nothing about bruce and that was management that's not  bruce but but that none of it's bruce guaranteed right the time the one time i interacted with him he 
[00:47:00]  was great yeah management decided that that uh roland should not get a picture of bruce  springsteen and that is infuriating to really i can't even tell you how much that bothers me  that's well whatever yeah but and then and then bruce should have played i don't know who's  responsible for that yeah yeah no he was good the contest winners no he wasn't good he hugged  them all he was good but it could have been better i mean and your experience could have been way better  you could have finally got your bruce springsteen picture play a goddamn song if you play one song 
[00:47:30]  that would have been one song would have been fine if he's gonna like just do an interview  but but to not play one fucking acoustic song that's dog this is an ozzy situation like if ozzy was  here and was in the same situation where he was only going to sign take pictures with fans the company  knowing that jimmy is a massive ozzy fan yeah should just do the right thing and get jimmy a picture with  ozzy this is what happened to poor roland liam is great he does whatever he can has nothing to do 
[00:48:00]  with nothing i'm not blaming no no no no what i'm saying is the guys down the hall decided that  roland because he's an employee should not get a picture when i had my jeter photo when jeter was  here they wouldn't get that signed either it's like when you have a photo with a guy  and you can't get that site it's like you know i just got a text by the way from a friend of mine  who manages uh like you know he's he's involved with a lot of bands and he said uh if bruce does a  private christmas show in new jersey like he does he may have pull for you for me so which would  mean for you because the guy knows a lot of so hopefully he will you were this close to finally 
[00:48:30]  getting your picture sounds like no this close i know you would have blew it up put it put it in  your living room get jerked off on it oh yeah it would be my christmas card my christmas for me and  bruce of course it would have been and if i got married my wedding card of course it would have  been members no they legalized that you know no wonder they didn't let him near him that maniacal  laugh i literally 
[00:49:00]  i can't comprehend not passing a photo of two people together and getting inside i just can't  comprehend it yeah but even but come on roland what about that's sure that's obvious that's nonsense  down the hall that's why uh whatever but well as i understand that because it's like so it's tight  security we're supposed to understand wrong but you don't you don't understand you know how easy it  would have been if if people really want to take care of employees around here instead of sort of  taking care of them has a guitar doesn't play doesn't play just strong the whole thing is a mess 
[00:49:30]  rollin come on who's he you're yating who's he that he has a guitar and he doesn't play doesn't  play and he shouldn't have been interviewed with a guitar in his hands but today at 10 30 i'll turn  to easter radio so i can listen to all day and drive everybody nuts he's hysterical i think i'd  have everybody nuts when i play bruce too loud yeah they don't like it down the hall well they're  hearing it every day they're like really they're like yep yeah who told you you couldn't get a picture 
[00:50:00]  by the way yeah who was the person that actually said it gave you the bad news please tell me i don't  remember no you do write it down come on write it down go ahead well i just go like this in the air  who was it it's somebody give us a letter i can okay this letter i i knew what it was yeah and what's  the second uh the name what does that start with no no is this the second letter oh wait wait that's the 
[00:50:30]  last name no it's it's this all right here we go right yeah yeah yeah of course god let the little  guy get his goddamn picture with his hero whatever little fella two years can't go by fast enough uh  roland thank you brother thank you though because you guys it wasn't for you guys i wouldn't be near the  the fishbowl yeah i know we had to work that for him you know so so he almost was taken care of 
[00:51:00]  to hear him strum through fucking bank bulletproof glass that's what roland got  this is what roland heard  what no they had the speakers all over the place oh did they yeah you might as well just be listening  to east street radio an interview i couldn't see him though couldn't fucking were you able to  really see him really yeah why is that that glass distorts uh it's like you watched him on a giant 
[00:51:30]  screen tv no if you i went to the bathroom i noticed that angle from the the by the bathroom is really  you saw bruce like i i would see fish without a diving mask while i'm scuba diving yeah yeah all  right did he look a lot bigger through the glass right you didn't see shit uh it's just like the king  christmas you put your face against the window yes he's in the fish bowl whatever strumming and  talking oh was that annoying fuck him bro i know bruce doesn't annoy me oh he bugs me because again 
[00:52:00]  he's not the one making those decisions he was the one making the decision not to sing a song  honestly though as a hardcore fan there's 20 hardcore fans yeah they don't mind hearing an  interview that's like if i had to love to have heard a song i would sit there and listen to  ozzy talk for two hours well of course you would uh but but he's got the guitar he's there yeah sing  the fucking song yeah but ozzy canceled his new york date so oh you almost got me i actually didn't know 
[00:52:30]  we love having your back brother i got you  i'm not gonna rest until we get a picture with uh you and bruce springsteen yeah let's have that which  could have so happened last night that's all you want in life yeah you came so close all right  damn pussy yes you want pussy hey um did you guys know ed asner is a truther what uh one of these 
[00:53:00]  9 11 fucking he was on adam carolla's podcast oh good that will help out adam carolla's podcast  today because uh we got audio of ed asner being a truther he's allowed to do one that's wonderful and  we're gonna um play that after the uh after the break lucky fella no more podcasts for you  i don't know figure something out i'd like to do one yeah i'll i'll put you know i'll put opian anthony  and serious stuff on it if that's cool i gotta talk to somebody i should be able to do that it's good  for the show it's it's an extension of the show it's like free advertising for the show it's an extension 
[00:53:30]  of the show it's it's whatever i look at the fucking huge amounts of money for equipment that  i can't use right like laszlo's coming over to do a show i think next week oh other people could use  your other people can use my studio you can't no it's like silly they don't know i don't understand  how the new world works they just don't it's an extension of the show it should be yeah if it was 
[00:54:00]  me and you going to your house after this show and doing a show that i could see would be a problem  now you got me going again but i'm just fine but they don't want you doing a show without without  without me yeah that's that's dumb because you doing a show by yourself is different than the opian  anthony show and it's completely different it's just me in my basement uh talking about  shit and taking phone calls it's it's not even it doesn't resemble this show i don't talk about the 
[00:54:30]  same stuff it's like a whole different format and everything it's it's not using material that  would have been used here there's you know you know oprah winfrey i think she's pretty big in the  in the world right yes she's fat she does podcasts after a tv show yeah do you understand what people  are doing out there it's advertising i believe ellen degeneres does a little of that too and i could  put a graphic up and a crawl with the number to order the friggin uh service whatever they want if  they that's fine but for some reason i can't why don't they understand that's an extension of of the 
[00:55:00]  brand it absolutely i got to talk to somebody and figure this out because it's not what am i infringing  upon you know they're just it doesn't make sense you're not they're not i just say that they're not  embracing the media the the that's out there that is available to everybody to to you know promote the  show it's it's how the media is it's how media is working these days yeah you can't just do one 
[00:55:30]  thing you gotta want to be and they want to be 10 years behind what's going on right like 10 years from  now they'll be like it's a good idea to have a podcast everybody should have one it'll probably  be mandatory it's amazing go home and do your homework and by the way there are guys that work  here at sirius xm that that do just that oh i know i know for some reason i can't fucking do it  right you know what i made the mistake of making it look too good it looked too professional it was  just me with a fucking iphone i say you just do it what are they gonna do in the end i don't want 
[00:56:00]  to fucking cause any shit just get your fu money man it'll be so much fun no no no i i i i have it  all right then just do the podcast i'd rather get really confused like he put what he what  it would be a lot better if they would just come to their senses and embrace the fact  that people do this it's the future  that is so appropriate right there what am i thinking everyone's doing it it's an extension of 
[00:56:30]  the main show everyone's that people in media are doing yeah it's not everyone is being honestly  being on air here means nothing yeah me in the sense that yeah usually at every other place i've  worked and i mean every network every place they treat you a certain way when you're on air  and you know again as long as you're not a dick right here not you could literally you get the same 
[00:57:00]  treatment as if there was a log stuck in the toilet and they were handing you a plunger oh yeah  i've never experienced it in fucking in 20 years of doing this with some of the material we put out it's  the same thing anyway just trying to dislodge some shit and the competition man they're they're  nipping at our heels and they don't understand you know you got to take care of uh you got to take  care of talent there are podcasts out there there are all kinds of shit out there that is an alternative 
[00:57:30]  to every other kind of media and and instead of embracing it and and figure out how it works for  everybody yeah encouraging uh people that do shows on this platform to get out there and do other  things dude for the brand it's like nothing i don't understand it i gotta be a media mogul i'm  thinking yeah that's what i'm gonna do next a mogul yeah total mogul all all in yeah yeah because 
[00:58:00]  see logically if ant goes home and does a podcast without me and without jimmy it's a different look  at what ants all about and then shit happens on this podcast that we actually play on this show  yeah it gives material to this show right it's not the other way around i'm not taking material  from this show and doing it on my my podcast right i'm doing shit that just you know like i said i'm in  my basement it's all about you know being home and being an asshole and yeah i'm not i'm not even  paranoid i'm not even allowed to do videos in studio that's why i you know half the stuff doesn't go 
[00:58:30]  online because they have a major problem with me just doing video in in the studio they're like oh that's  not good they actually said to me oh that's not good but it would promote no one else is allowed  to do that people see it and go oh it's who is this it's just another extension of the show oh maybe  i'll check them out they actually said oh that's not good how is it that you're doing that i we really  have to have a little and then they then they said well if you at least you know put film that 
[00:59:00]  serious xm on your videos i guess we'll let it slide for now they said for now yeah i'll put a  fucking graphic up believe me how do you some of the hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of  equipment to have a graphic put up on my fucking uh how screen while i'm doing it how are you in  charge and you say oh that's not good that's not good that's bad did you think it over and and come  up with a reason it's not good or did you just instantly spit out it's not good because if you have  a reason could i hear it is it possible that when you're doing a podcast that people that don't know 
[00:59:30]  know the opian anthony show uh stumble upon you and go oh oh and he does a show on satellite you  know i gotta check that out as well let me check that out or if you got a video that sort of goes  viral online and and you know it's associated with the opian anthony show wouldn't that possibly lead  to that person you know being turned on to the radio show subscribing it just it no makes there's no  rhyme or reason to it i've never heard a legitimate reason it's a it's it's just exhausting i mean 
[01:00:00]  it goes back to roland not getting his picture i i can't even tell you how what that does to me  as a human being how ridiculous that is how everything has to be complicated yeah it's no  one would have known all he had to do is get in line with a bunch of listeners you're talking about  the biggest fucking bruce springsteen yeah fan on the planet literally the i mean we we've challenged  other people and no one is bigger a bigger fan in more ways than one than roland yeah and they said  no no no we can't do that the default answer to everything seems to just be no like like it's an 
[01:00:30]  instant no unless you get a miracle and could talk them out of it but the default thing no matter what  you ask it instantly is no without any thought being given to their no there's just no there's a  ton of people on the line uh naming people that do podcasts that are associated with serious xm i don't  want to blow up anyone's spot but yeah you got it there's a bunch of people yeah that are doing it  a bunch but for some reason uh they don't want it doing it i don't know why it doesn't make sense 
[01:01:00]  i it's fun to do i enjoy doing it it would be good for the show and uh you know i i carved out a  little niche in my basement it's fun whatever i gotta i gotta have a chit chat with somebody  and and make this work oh yeah yeah really yeah good luck because now because now you're gonna  owe them something you know that right no of course because they're gonna say well we'll let  you do that but if why that's how it works can i just do it that's how it works my house nothing 
[01:01:30]  is just done because it makes sense now there's a negotiation where they might let you do it but  there's gonna have to be something on the other side of it something on the other side that's  gonna drive you nuts by the way it's not gonna be a dumb little logo or some stupid thing oh god  because that's how this place works i'm not making everything is a ridiculous  believe me it costs money i'm not making money of it it's not about that it's exhausting i know it  really is this this is the i'm gonna talk this is the easiest gig in the country and they just make 
[01:02:00]  it so fucking complicated it should just always be able to do it all right mad you're not mad at me  are you you did i go too far not at all mad at you all right no did i get you going no no not dude  no you just slammed your headphones down you're re-eating no no i would actually get up and hug  you right now if i wasn't eating eggs no not all you it makes sense right how it just has to always  be like a problem yeah there's always an issue what what what bothered you without you getting 
[01:02:30]  yourself in trouble i'm not working in trouble i mean i believe i'm just the whole mentality of it  i don't know why radio guys have to be treated like shit always i've been doing this since i was 18 and  we're always treated like shit they never do the right thing i you know we've all been lucky enough  to work in other like media and and you see how they treat their talent but radio guys are supposed  to i guess just be treated like shit scum of the earth that's it scum everything's a problem 
[01:03:00]  everything nothing's easy it's never easy never everything's a negotiation yeah everything is just  a an instant no and then a fight to try to get a maybe and this will start with the the rolling thing  i keep going back to that because i i hope people understand how ridiculous that is that  management could have done the right thing for a massive fan and they feel like they did the right  thing because they let him see bruce through the fishbowl yeah when he could have easily been in  the fishbowl no one would have cared and no one would have had a good argument like well why does he 
[01:03:30]  get to do it you tell the people because he's a massive fucking fan and that's what we decide and he  works here right you know no i'm talking about other employees and other you know people like that  you just tell him guess what he's the biggest fan in the world so we made an exception deal with it  you go in there and watch the man with a guitar not right and then walk up to roll and go you know  what did you enjoy it i really hope you enjoyed it you know we want to take care of you here at  serious xm you know what wrong once you get on the back of that line with your camera get your 
[01:04:00]  photo of springsteen no one's gonna know in the end you do that buddy but there's got to be a no  for no reason there just has to be there's no reason for the no but no one can argue the no i'm  sorry i would love for someone to be brave enough to come in here and argue and give me a reason  aside from just don't have a good argument for the no yeah but you have a little power and you want  to fucking keep your employees down that's that's what it comes down to because radio guys are  shit in the end yeah i should have learned that a long fucking time ago but no the instant no for no 
[01:04:30]  reason right all right sorry for the bitching yeah had to get that out though uh it's very  legitimate huh it is right very legitimate yeah yeah because i've been you know how you're supposed  to be treated in certain backstage situations and how you are and it's it's when you notice one place  is different than every other place and i mean the mentality of it yeah that you've ever worked with 
[01:05:00]  i don't even blame this place because every radio company has been exactly the fucking same i want  reasons i don't just want to know i want a reason behind the fucking no and regardless of what i'm  asking about whether it's me doing a podcast uh roland not being able to go into the fishbowl  like just instead of just no that can't happen give me a fucking reason in the end no one would have  noticed roland in the fishbowl no and in the end no one would have noticed that roland got online and 
[01:05:30]  got a picture with uh fans yeah and he's a a much bigger fan than than the fans that showed up the  whale bowl see because he's big would look like star trek with the one with the whales  roland's big but you don't consider him fat no he's not weird big roly-poly fun guy  all right enough bitching i guess people hate when we bitch i'm sorry yeah  fuck it's uh this has to be done give me an answer i guess we shouldn't bitch at all because  nothing ever changes you know when you bitch you'd bitch because you hope something changes so we're 
[01:06:00]  we're lunatics for even bitching maybe i'll get an answer now they could actually sit back and and  and because now they have all morning to construct a reason around no because there is no reason  so now they can construct one all right why why is there no i don't know all right let's say um that  will affect the show no he already addressed that it wouldn't affect that um let's say like now they 
[01:06:30]  could come up with a reason good i'll give you all the time you got fucking you know till 10 o'clock  just to come up with a reason why i can't do it for the people out there imagine whatever job you do  for a living uh-huh you decided as an individual that you're going to do more for the company right  right on your own time at home i i see the faces out there like what but you decide you know what i  want to do more yeah company that's what this is about when i'm filming videos in studio or in the 
[01:07:00]  hallways that you know they have a major problem with that that's why i only put up a video every  once in a while they have a major fucking problem with that and then anthony wants to do more as well  and go home and do some podcasts that is obviously associated with what we do here this is the  epicenter of the opian anthony show but then you branch out branch out without that's what media  people do that know what the fuck they're doing you think i'm gonna like blow all the good material at  home so when i come in the next day i'll be like i don't have anything did it all on the podcast 
[01:07:30]  you mean that's not what's been happening yeah i have no reason but imagine imagine if you will out  there you decided you want to do more for the company and the company actually turns around and  goes no we don't want you doing anything more yeah yeah that's great to simplify that's basically what  happens mm-hmm fantastic i know give me a reason i know so much more than anyone in control here by  10 could you just please give me a reason i know so much more that's why i don't sleep at night 
[01:08:00]  great and then people tell me that my anger issues get in the way of my success oh  fuck you go fuck yourself there's no reason everybody can't be right his anger issues are  actually a hurdle that he needs to overcome really prove to me you know more than me prove it i want an 
[01:08:30]  so  hey your girl's your daddy home don't tell me if you're all alone  there's a bad desire  oh  oh 
[01:09:00]  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh

[01:10:00]  Follow the O.P. and Anthony Show on Twitter.  O.P. Twitter.com slash O.P. Radio. 
[01:10:30]  Anthony. Twitter.com slash Anthony Cumia.  And little Jimmy Norton. Twitter.com slash Jim Norton.  Is Pat Cooper coming in today?  Today's the day for Pat Cooper, right?  Allegedly.  Yeah, he is.  Very cool.  I see him walking around the neighborhood from time to time.  He's a complete load of tech. 
[01:11:00]  Is he?  He's an 80-year-old guy with the energy of a, I don't know, 20-something-year-old.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, yeah.  Is he just going to be screaming?  Is he just going to be screaming about something?  He just walks down the sidewalk screaming.  Yeah.  And no one in particular.  He's just always uptight.  He's always uptight.  Yeah.  But we love him.  Pat Cooper at 9 o'clock today.  And a guy named Jim Sturgis.  Was he in Bringing Down the House? 
[01:11:30]  I think he was.  The movie's 21.  I don't know.  Didn't read that book?  Oh, no.  I saw the movie.  It was pretty good.  Book was way better.  Yeah.  But he did a very good job.  He was the lead character in 21, right?  Jim Sturgis?  So, we'll talk to him about a new movie called Heartless, which sounds like it's going to  be a pretty cool flick.  Demons and shit.  Ooh.  Heartless is the story of a boy living in England, in an area notorious for gangs. 
[01:12:00]  At one point, the gangs start wearing demon masks.  However, we find out they are not wearing masks at all, as they are real demons.  Yeah.  So.  Hmm.  You all right?  Yeah, he's coming in, huh?  What?  Did that last break bum everyone out?  I'm just going to start calling him like I sees him.  Are you bummed?  I'm not even bummed. 
[01:12:30]  I'm just.  I could care less.  It's like every time I try not to fucking be that way.  You try to stay positive.  We really do.  I really.  A lot of the listeners hate when we bitch, or a certain amount of them.  They bitch about their jobs, too.  Yeah, that's why I think it's worth doing, because we all bitch about our lives and our  jobs.  But you're listening to guys that have the easiest jobs in America, and we're bitching.  Yeah.  It's little shit.  It's not major shit.  It's exhausting.  And I know who it is. 
[01:13:00]  Then they throw us a little nugget.  What do they call it?  A little.  A little tidbit.  Yeah.  A little treat.  Like we went over the whole commercial thing, where they thought that would make us feel good,  that were part of the SiriusXM commercial.  We went over that last week.  We were in the commercial.  Our logo was in the commercial for a third of a second.  That was good.  I liked that.  But we're supposed to be grateful that that was done for us.  We're not 20-year-old kids that just got in the business.  That shit used to excite the crap out of me.  He reportedly does the vocals for three songs in the movie. 
[01:13:30]  What?  He played Jude in Across the Universe.  Yeah, man.  Jim Sturgis.  Born in London and raised in Farnham.  He acted for a long time in England.  Yes.  Before his break.  His living girlfriend is Mickey O'Brien.  The keyboardist for the pop band LaRoe.  This is a favor for Roland.  This is a favor for Roland. 
[01:14:00]  I know.  Stay positive.  He has to do favors every once in a while for our pal.  Roland was legitimately happy.  Honestly, he was legitimately happy to sit there and just watch.  He would love to pitch.  I just talked to him off the air.  He's a fucking retarded child.  But honestly, he was like, he's like, yeah, you know, I got to see him.  If I had, Roland will live to be 100.  Because Roland doesn't get stressed or that crazy about stuff.  He really doesn't. 
[01:14:30]  That's why he will outlive every one of us.  We'll all be dead before we're 75.  He will live to be a fucking 100 because he doesn't stress this shit.  This is going to ruin my day.  I've never dealt with this in my life.  I'm a psychopath.  I'm a lunatic.  I'm an asshole.  Go to break.  But.  But.  And here's the big but.  But.  I would not be able to live with myself if I had the power to get someone, like, rolling  a picture with Bruce Springsteen and decided to use my power to say fucking no.  I would not be able to do that. 
[01:15:00]  I could do some dicky things, but that's one I would not be able to do.  Ever.  And it was that easy, too.  It was that easy.  I don't know.  How do we go through a break and we come back out of it saying the same shit?  Because I'm sorry.  I just want to reason.  No, no, it's not because I feel the same way.  I'm just talking and same shit.  All right.  I'm just living.  Yeah.  It's just.  Like.  It's so hard.  Not even that I want to yell.  I don't.  I'm not angry.  Yell angry.  I'm just like.  And people are probably saying, why are you obsessing about Roland and the Bruce Springsteen? 
[01:15:30]  I'm thinking about me.  But that's.  It's.  It represents so much.  That's why we're obsessing about it.  Of course, that's the way it went down last night.  Of course.  Of course it did.  And that's why we're obsessing.  Yeah.  It symbolizes a lot of a lot of things that happen.  All right.  You want to want to deal with this guy who's an Internet sensation?  Oh, we might as well.  We have the latest Internet sensation. 
[01:16:00]  What is it?  Who was the last Internet sensation?  Sweeping the nation.  Tub girl.  No.  No.  Let's see.  I would say.  I'll take answers.  I'll take answers.  Double rainbow guy.  No.  There was a guy after that.  After that?  That was as big as double rainbow?  Yep.  Don't.  Don't write it, Danny.  Danny knows.  Danny's good, too.  Let me think.  Let me think.  The footage of the guy in China who fucking his motorcycle wiped out and he fell on the  train tracks and then a train came and hit him.  You got to stay off those websites.  No, no.  It's not graphic.  You don't see him.  Did he live?  No.  Oh, I don't believe he did. 
[01:16:30]  No.  No.  I don't think so.  Come on, Ant.  Don't look down.  No, I'm not.  That's why I'm looking.  Every once in a while, there's like one person that becomes an Internet sensation.  And we're not talking about the lady yelling at the postman.  And it says after double rainbow.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Hey, I might be wrong, by the way.  I could very easily be wrong.  I mean, the one I got actually happened after double rainbow guy.  Double rainbow guy was huge. 
[01:17:00]  And then there was a guy that was just as huge after that.  And it was a guy.  You got it.  You still got it, Danny?  You still got it?  I think so.  You got to be talking like as big as like chocolate green.  Nah.  Like that shit.  He wasn't as big as chocolate green.  Double rainbow.  Big as double rainbow?  It was approaching.  Approaching double rainbow.  Yeah.  There was remixes and all sorts of fun things.  It was all over the news.  He's got an agent now.  He was in L.A.  Walking around like he's hot shit. 
[01:17:30]  I'll give you the, there was a Halloween costume.  Yeah.  We can, we talked about this.  Oh, wow.  Halloween costume.  And I think he was the last one.  And now they're saying this guy we're going to play in a second here is going to be the  next one.  There's always one that goes completely over the top.  There's viral shit that happens all the time.  Yes.  I'm trying to, I don't know why.  I just have a mental block on this.  Then there's one that just comes along and just over the top.  I don't know.  Do we have the audio even?  I can get it real quick.  What's his name?  Dotson? 
[01:18:00]  Antoine Dotson.  Antoine Dotson.  Who's that guy?  Better hide your, your, your, your, your, your children.  The rapist guy.  Oh, rapist.  Hide your kids, hide your wife.  Interview guy.  Hide your kids, hide your wife.  Yeah, with a bandana.  I believe he was the last internet sensation.  And now they're talking about this guy that we're about to play could be the next one.  Take the offender off.  That break-in happened early this morning in the 500 block of Webster Drive in Huntsville. 
[01:18:30]  WFF 48's Elizabeth Jella caught up with the victim.  Elizabeth, emotions were running high.  You were able to even dress up like this guy.  And Mark, the woman, the victim tells us that a man broke into her house and tried to rape her.  Her brother went in and he tried to help her out, but the man got away, leaving behind, though, evidence of his visit.  Kelly Dodson was asleep with a little girl inside their apartment on Webster Drive when...  I was attacked by some idiot from out here in the projects. 
[01:19:00]  Dodson says her attacker used a garbage can to climb onto the unit's ledge, open the upstairs window, and then he got in bed with her.  He tried to rape me.  He tried to pull my clothes off.  Dodson struggled with her attacker, knocking over items in her bedroom.  Antoine Dodson heard his sister scream and ran to help.  Well, obviously, we have a rapist in Linkin Park.  He's climbing in your windows.  He's snatching your people up, trying to rape them.  So y'all need to hide your kids, hide your wife, and hide your husband because they're raping everybody out here. 
[01:19:30]  The attacker got leased.  They're raping everybody out here.  What an asshole.  So, uh...  What a shithead.  20 million people have watched that fucking nonsense just on this version.  Just on this version.  Because it's been uploaded by a billion people.  Why?  Because it's awesome.  I don't know.  But, I mean, it's a fun clip.  Yeah, but not 20 million fun.  What is it?  It just happened.  Look, Jimmy.  Well, here's another person with another three and a half million. 
[01:20:00]  Wow.  So, I mean, total hits on that.  Safe to say, I bet you it's close to, I don't know, 40 million probably if you add up all the versions of the video.  Between that and all the different songs that have been remixed.  And then there was an auto-tune thing that happened.  Yeah, I'm with Jimmy.  I don't know why.  I don't know if it's 20 million views interesting.  How many...  It's good.  How many did Double Rainbow Guy get?  How many fucking...  Double Rainbow Guy.  Double Rainbow.  Original Double Rainbow. 
[01:20:30]  Original Double Rainbow.  Rainbow.  All the way.  Oh.  All the way.  Full on.  Oh.  Original Double Rainbow Guy.  Yeah, because now finding the original video.  Yeah.  Oh, that's...  No, no, that's not it.  Oh.  Can you just go...  I just don't remember what the guy's name was.  Can you just go most...  View count or whatever on that?  It might be this.  Double Rainbow.  Oh. 
[01:21:00]  Whoa, that's a full rainbow.  Holy shit.  It's 20 million.  It's 20 million.  Double Rainbow.  Oh, my God.  It's a Double Rainbow all the way.  All the way.  Whoa.  We talked to that guy, right?  Yeah.  I forgot already.  Whoa, man.  Whoa, man.  You know what?  This one I got here, it's not going to make 20 million views.  And not only did the Double Rainbow Guy do like 20 million...  I mean...  That's the original video.  You got the remix, which has done almost 16 million by itself, so... 
[01:21:30]  Wow.  That's just unbelievable.  That's just unbelievable how that happens.  Stupendous.  And stupid.  But I guess I think this is a Seattle TV station is at some big, I don't know, fucking place  where fucking stuff was being sold for, I don't know, like, for less than it was originally being sold for or something.  Something.  And this happened.  You can feel the excitement in this room, because there are some major shoppers here who know exactly what they're doing. 
[01:22:00]  Some of them are first-timers.  Some of them have been coming here for a long, long time.  Look at this guy.  He's got, like, he's got, like, an arm full of stuff.  Tell me.  Because it's happening.  You like my mom.  That's cute.  What are you getting?  Tons of fucking sequins.  Oh, okay.  Thank you very much.  Sorry about that.  And we will let you go now.  So we're here live in Goodwill.  And very exciting times.  They're not thinking what they're saying a bit as well.  People are banking on that one.  Really?  To be huge, yeah. 
[01:22:30]  But he only has...  Tons of fucking sequins.  He only has a quick line.  Yeah, that's in the category with Koran guy.  Yeah.  The guy who stole the Koran?  Yeah, I think...  And what was his phrase?  I can't even tell you.  The internet's attention span isn't very good.  No.  So if you're really going to have a place on the internet, I think you need more than one line.  Yeah.  Well, the Koran's a really good line.  It's got to be able to have a remix.  A lot of people saying that's a good line.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  I agree.  I don't think it's that good.  I mean, I'm saying that Turtles kid will be around forever, probably.  True.  What was the line with the Koran guy?  The hippie dude that stole the Koran?  I don't remember the line.  Look down.  They have it there.  What is it?  I'm like, you have no Koran.  Is that it?  Is that the line?  You're a stupid Koran, I think.  You're a stupid Koran.  Oh, yeah.  You're right, Jimmy. 
[01:23:30]  Jimmy's now just writing.  He's just writing.  He's just writing.  Damn.  It's just infuriating.  Never experienced it before.  It really is.  Never in my life.  Do you just decide, you know what?  I'm going to write some thank you notes.  What are you writing?  Just dialogue. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  I'm still paying attention.  I know you're paying attention.  I don't care about Rainbow Guy.  I hope he has a stroke.  I'm so cranky.  I have a very special show to announce today, too.  Oh, that's right.  I didn't mean to segue.  I just saw that.  When are you going to announce it?  Do you want to do it right now, Jimmy?  It goes on sale Friday morning at the Borgata.  It will sell out.  This is a great lineup.  Yeah, I'm very excited for you, Jimmy.  This is one that we wanted and we got.  It's January 16th.  I already know it.  I already know it.  It's a show. 
[01:24:30]  It's called The Antisocial Network.  It's hosted by myself.  It's myself, Bill Burr, Jim Brewer, and Dave Attell.  Jesus.  That's the 16th of January at the Borgata.  I think it's a great show, and I think it will sell out.  But that's an all-star game right there.  Yeah, I'm happy with that one.  We wanted Jim.  We wanted Bill.  We wanted Dave.  And all three of them.  Love all those guys.  I wish Attell would do our show more.  He's in L.A. right now, actually.  He's working on his show.  He's doing L.A. stuff.  He's been out there for a while.  He's working on his Showtime show.  He's editing and stuff like that.  Nice.  So Sunday, January 16th.  Tickets go on sale Friday morning at 10 o'clock. 
[01:25:00]  I'll be plugging it all week.  But again, I think this one's going to go quickly because they're giving us billboards and everything.  Oh, forget it.  So I'm very happy about that.  Yeah, no, this thing will sell out, so get your tickets.  I hope so.  Oh, my God.  Aren't you humiliating if there's 100 people?  You want to bet money on that?  No.  I hope you're right.  Yeah, that's going to be a good one.  Hey, what was the idea that one of your people came up with and you wanted to spit in his face or something?  Oh, I think.  I forgot what you said exactly yesterday, but you were not happy.  The artwork for it.  Did you see it, Kenny? 
[01:25:30]  No.  It was for the possible—we're getting a billboard, I think, outside the Holland and one in Atlantic City.  Ooh.  You should do the outside the Lincoln.  I don't know if that one was available.  It's whatever the Borgata owns, but they have ones that are—  They own the one outside the Lincoln.  That's why I'm correcting you.  But they own the one, too, I think.  And here I'm saying it, too.  Oh, okay.  Pete was saying Holland.  Either one's great.  And the artwork—Pete had some weird theme in mind, or the Live Nation artist.  It was fucking so bad.  Like, what I wanted was, like, I'm going to put all four of our faces. 
[01:26:00]  Let me see while you guys are talking if I can bring up what was—  What was the—you actually have the graphic there?  It ain't good.  I'm going to fight him.  It ain't good.  Wait, but I'm confused.  You're doing a comedy show and they're actually promoting it with billboards and stuff?  It's—  Huh.  Yeah.  Must be nice.  It's bizarre.  Pete's like, what do you want the billboard to look like?  I'm like, oh, that's right.  This is stand-up.  This is the Borgata.  It's different.  They actually do—are happy I'm there. 
[01:26:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Let me see.  You know how good they treated me at the—it's funny.  Like, when Bill Cosby was working there, as a courtesy, they, like—all I wanted to  do—I have a photo of Cosby.  I wanted to get it signed.  And they actually walked me back to his dressing room, and he happened to sit there.  It was just like—it's just a great mentality there.  To me, we were in the big commercial for a third of a second.  We're just—it's just as good here.  Hold on.  Let me see here.  I don't want to stop the show, but if I could— 
[01:27:00]  No, I just want to say this.  Dude, it's not good.  Now, I'll show you what we wound up deciding on, which I was okay with.  He might be tricking us.  No, no, no.  I'll show you the real one.  He might be tricking us.  We're supposed to go like, oh, that's cool.  And then he goes, no, idiots.  That's the bad one.  This is—again, this is going to be a rough—  I'll be honest.  It's just our faces.  Just be honest, Anthony.  Yeah.  Just give these people hell, man.  Oh, hold on.  For Pete's sake.  Oh, for the love of Eve.  Excuse my language. 
[01:27:30]  What's the matter?  You can't catch your computer working?  It's fine now.  It's downloading.  It was just too small.  Oh, here it is.  Okay.  This is probably the one, or close to the one, that they're going to do.  Like, that's kind of the one.  It's just the four of us on a huge billboard.  That's cool.  Yeah, that is cool.  That is cool.  I don't think he's tricking us.  No, this is actually the real one.  No, that is.  Obviously.  The logo is Anti-Social Network.  It says—much bigger letters, the last name.  So it just says, Attell Brewer-Barr-Norton, and I'm hosting it. 
[01:28:00]  I don't want it to seem like I'm headlining.  Borgata, January 16th.  It's a great ad.  Simple billboard.  Oof.  Where's the one that they wanted to do?  Oh.  Did you tweet this shit?  No, I don't know if I'm allowed to.  Yeah.  They usually frown on that.  But I do want to.  Oh, God.  Where is it?  Oh, it's not good.  By the way, as he finds that, the Hide Your Kids—the auto-tuned his thing there is the most downloaded  song on iTunes or something like that. 
[01:28:30]  Really?  Yeah.  We're close.  I don't know what the stat is or something, but I think it was like number one for like  a week.  It did ridiculously well.  That fucking—well, those are the guys that do that auto-tune the news, so they're doing  very well for themselves.  I like auto-tune the news.  It's a good bit.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I have to find it in my old mail.  I don't think I saved this one.  Your old mail?  Yeah.  You know, it's funny.  You could actually search on Gmail.  I know.  I tried it, but it never—atly says looking for servers.  It was some horseshit. 
[01:29:00]  It's always a problem.  All right.  Well, Cole—  I'll let you know in a second when I find it.  I'm so eager to see it.  Oh, it's not good.  Because I love when things aren't good.  Yeah, well.  Let's see.  Sorry, guys.  I will tweet this eventually.  I want to—  Oh, you know what it was?  Yeah.  I texted it to my girlfriend, so hold on.  Oh.  Search under piece of shit.  It's just like this.  Her name comes up.  Oh, no. 
[01:29:30]  No, I meant the ad.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Although some of the stuff she texts.  Oh, she really makes me laugh.  What a riot.  She is a—  A regular riot.  She really is a panic.  A panic.  Okay, where is it?  Here we go.  Hold on.  I'm emailing it because you can't see it on this.  No.  Email photo.  Oh, so you're emailing it to your computer.  To myself, and I'll open it.  Yeah.  And then you can open it. 
[01:30:00]  This better be a good billboard.  Oh, it's probably going to suck ass.  Love it.  I mean, good in a bad way.  Oh, in a bad way.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that you'll—  People want to know how long before management stops Jim from doing his stand-up.  That will never happen.  Yeah.  Please.  That would never happen.  No, it wouldn't.  There would have been issues.  You know, it's so silly.  It's so silly.  Jackass.  Okay, did it go?  Oh, there it is.  No.  Went!  Go! 
[01:30:30]  Don't you hate when you email something to yourself and it doesn't immediately show up?  To answer your question, yes, I do hate that a lot.  You're a foot away from—  Yeah, you're right there.  I'm actually pushing the phone at the computer to make it go faster.  Go!  Because it's got to travel so far.  Yeah, where does that email go?  From there to there.  Oh, wait.  This might—hold on, hold on.  It is quite astounding.  I know.  It's the longest distance known to man is the head to the heart.  Did you hear that?  No.  Thank God I've never heard that.  Come on, stop being the good one. 
[01:31:00]  Sucker!  This is taking way too long.  Just humiliating.  It's one long act of humiliation.  Go!  It said it sent.  What the fuck?  Yeah, come on.  Maybe you could describe it to us.  You can't.  I want to see it.  This is just lunacy.  I know, I know.  You really want to see it.  Here it goes.  Oh, okay.  Let me see if—  He said here it goes ten times.  I know I did.  Believe me.  I keep waiting for you to turn it around so we can see. 
[01:31:30]  Now half the picture is showing.  Why does the internet rape me every time?  Why does it do this?  You stink.  Dude, on ice.  I really am a bag of garbage.  Why can't you get the picture?  I'll answer your question, because I'm garbage.  That's why.  Piece of shit.  You got half the picture?  Okay.  Oh, okay.  He's got it.  Danny, do you see that?  Yeah.  How bad is that?  Is this legit, too? 
[01:32:00]  Oh, this is the one they want.  All right, turn around.  Is that horrible?  It's, uh—  All right.  Danny's just laughing at it.  Me and Opie haven't seen it yet.  Come on.  Let's see this.  Jimmy's got to spin this thing around.  This was going to be the billboard.  If Pete had his way?  Yeah.  This is, uh—  That's, uh—  No, come on.  No way.  It says the Antisocial Network on the top.  And Dave's picture wasn't in here yet, because they didn't get his head shot.  It's Photoshopped.  It's a little boat.  Oh, my God.  And it's Bill Burr. 
[01:32:30]  And he's got a fucking, like, a Henry Fonda hat on, and he's holding a fish.  A big fish, like a salmon or a big fucking trout or something.  There's a big house and some trees in the background.  There's people rowing in the background.  Jim Brewer is standing in the boat with a fucking horrible vest, and I'm just in my head shot  with my feet on the water like I'm the Messiah.  Yeah.  You're supposed to be sitting on the edge of the boat.  Look at Bill Burr holding the fish.  And a little girl could do a better Photoshop job. 
[01:33:00]  That's what he's like.  He's like, no, it's a whole thing.  I'm like, oh—  What do you mean it's a whole thing?  It's fucking—  What does it mean?  Exactly.  He's like, that's a very famous photo.  I fucking screamed on the phone.  That's not a famous photo.  What do you mean it's a famous photo?  The background or something.  I don't know.  What?  It's not a famous photo if no one in studio knows the photo.  Do you—I was—all I was—I was in L.A. and I was just going, it's fucking terrible.  It's fucking terrible.  And he's like, well, you know, I mean, they thought—I'm like, it's fucking terrible. 
[01:33:30]  I was out of my mind, Frankie.  They say I have anger issues.  Jimmy, your anger issues are way worse than mine.  That's awful.  Way worse.  This is—look at—look at Bill Burr's holding a fish.  Not only is he holding a fish, but his head isn't even centered, like it's off to the  left a little bit.  Dude, he's holding a fish, and I have my fucking regular headshot where I'm sitting  on a stool, but I'm on the edge of a boat clumsily, and my feet are like on the water?  Yeah, it's—  Who sits like that on a boat? 
[01:34:00]  No one.  And where was David Tell supposed to be?  His was going to come in next, but Tell's headshot, he has a really cool shot for performing.  It's like a—it's him in a weird Hawaiian shirt with his hands up in the air, and it  looks good on a comedy club coming.  Would have been great on that boat.  They would have put him in the back of the boat.  So Brewer's standing—  Maybe they could have had a fish in his hands if he's holding his hands up.  Dude, you got the big catch.  Brewer's head is too big for his body in the Photoshop, and he's got a really homoerotic  pose.  Please tweet that. 
[01:34:30]  I'm going to.  You could tweet that.  Oh, fuck them.  Horrible.  Just tweet that.  I think I will.  You should, man.  I think I will.  It's fucking—  And Bill Burr must have really good knees because he's leaning on the lip of a rowboat.  Dude, and he's—  His foot is hanging half off the boat, and he's holding a fish that is literally three  feet.  You know how much it would suck to knee on the side of a—  Oh.  Have your knees on the side of a boat.  You can't even do it.  Holding up your weight.  The reason I didn't okay it, and all the guys have to okay it, is because it was—as a 
[01:35:00]  goof, it would have been funny to shit on, but people wouldn't know what the poster was.  Yeah.  I'm like, people, what do you think, they stop and look at billboards?  They're driving.  That's not the famous one.  That's why the simple, your guys' faces, with your names, where you're going to be,  it's simple.  You're going to be able to drive past that.  You'd be looking at that going, what?  What is it?  With their bills holding a fish?  Who is that guy with the little hat?  You don't even know it's Bill Burr.  No, you don't know it's Brewer.  You don't know anything. 
[01:35:30]  You don't know it's any of us.  Unless I was standing there pointing, going, that's me, and that's Brewer.  That's just plum stupid.  Wow, is that terrible?  Yeah, this is good.  With the one they have is fucking simple.  Yeah.  Yeah, but there's no fish in that one.  Yeah.  Yeah, where are the fish?  It sucks.  Oh, dude, it's so bad.  I'm so happy with this one.  This one is just our headshot superimposed together.  Our names in big yellow letters.  To the point, it jumps out at you, it gives you the information as you're driving. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  People don't have an hour to decipher a fucking poster?  Ridiculous.  Ugh, motherfuckers.  Tickets on sale Friday.  Oh, yeah, the big show, uh, Borgata?  January 16th, yes.  It's, uh, I believe Martin Luther King weekend.  It's that Sunday.  One show, uh, we're doing one show only, and it will sell out.  Because Brewer's got a date there.  He has a date, I believe, this month.  One show, which has been sold out since it went on sale.  Mm-hmm.  And Bill Burr is, uh, selling tremendous everywhere. 
[01:36:30]  Fucking Burr, yeah.  Yeah.  So, whatever.  Burr's huge.  Yeah, he's actually doing great, man.  He's good.  Good.  Good for Bill.  All right.  And his fish.  Bill and his fish.  I can't wait to show Bill that.  Dude, dude, it's a fish.  He's just going to laugh and say something.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm holding a fish.  I need to follow the fish.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Dude, that's the way the bankers hold your money.  They look to the left and they smile.  The Illuminati. 
[01:37:00]  Talk about the Illuminati.  I got to show Bill that.  I'll go, please.  Everyone thinks it's, uh, Washington crossing the, uh...  Potomac?  The Delaware or whatever it was.  No, it's, it's, it's a famous rowing photo.  Well, George Washington is in the, the most famous rowing photo.  Can I, can I see the George Washington?  I have no idea who that is.  Like, what that photo is.  I don't either.  It's stupid.  It's from the movie Three Assholes and a Fish.  No.  Three Assholes and a Fish.  I reckon, that's a painting, first of all.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no fish in that.  It's a bunch of queers painting fucking Washington this stinky asshole in someone's face. 
[01:37:30]  Why don't we respect George Washington for fucking being in a rowboat?  Exactly.  He's a pup.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, put him in, uh, today's, uh, time.  Yeah.  You wouldn't get, uh, Obama in a rowboat like that, crossing a river.  Slave joke?  No.  No, but I guess so.  You could, but I wasn't.  Just, yeah.  Decided to be over the top asshole guy today.  There's, there's some not being able to swim jokes.  Of course.  Of course. 
[01:38:00]  Holding a fish.  Fish.  Why is he holding a fish?  Dude, I was screaming.  I don't yell at Peter John.  I yell, but not at those guys.  I just kept screaming.  It's fucking terrible.  Isn't that one of those things where you just laugh, though?  I would laugh at some point.  No, because we were under a time constraint.  We had, like, 24 hours to turn it around because the artwork's going to print, I think, today,  or it had to be approved.  But, you know, it's all, they need a few days to get it ready and go to press.  God, you guys don't even have to promote that.  Yeah, but we want, you want it to be a good showing.  I honestly don't know. 
[01:38:30]  I have no idea.  I can't wait for that.  Um, but I know that all of us sell pretty well in AC.  That's a good market.  Really?  And they're doing a lot of Philly advertising.  And tickets are on sale Friday.  Friday morning, yeah.  Friday morning at 10 a.m., I believe, at the Borgata.  Kenny, right?  Yes, 10 o'clock, Borgata.com.  Borgata.com, you can get tickets.  Oh, wow, Kenny knows everything.  He does.  He's a machine.  He is.  All right, we'll, uh.  Personality of one.  We'll step aside.  We got, uh, Jim Sturgis coming in.  Very excited, right, Ant?  Yes!  Jim Sturgis is here early. 
[01:39:00]  We can take him after break and get it over with if you want.  Oh, Jesus.  I wasn't supposed to read.  Oh, you don't read that.  That's not, I just assumed you would have written something that was safe for everybody.  And you just fucked me.  Oh, boy, that's, um, not.  Ooh, proofread next time.  Oh.  And then we got, uh, Pat Cooper at 9 o'clock.  Who told you that?  Yeah.  Putting this shit.  What the fuck?  I write a book.  What the fuck you gotta call it like that for? 
[01:39:30]  Hello?  You guys rock?  Yeah.  Who's this?  I don't think I've ever laughed as hard at anything in my life.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Call 866-1-1-1.  That's 866-969-1969.  Uh, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, so, what is that drink they're getting rid of that all the kids are talking about?  Oh, it's that caffeinated alcohol drink. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had a version of that growing up, right?  What was the one we had that we used to make coffee with at, uh, AF?  Oh, that was that caffeine water shit.  Yeah, but that's pretty impressive.  You have caffeine water that you're making your coffee with.  That was a hell of a buzz we had going.  Yeah, but this is the, uh, it's got alcohol in it.  Four Loko.  Yeah, Four Loko.  The politicians taking care of us?  Thank you.  Thank you, politicians, for taking care of us.  New York State.  They're stopping shipments to New York State.  Did you hear about... 
[01:40:30]  Everybody's mad.  Did you hear about the cupcake guy?  Crank 2-0, it was called.  Crank 2-0, thank you, sir.  Is that the, um...  Kevin from Connecticut.  The councilman who...  Yeah, we'll talk about it after Jim Sturges, because I see he's walking down the hall.  But we've got to talk about cupcake guy.  You need to talk to your people.  And also, uh, those disposable grocery bags.  We've got to talk about that, because Schumer's, uh, keeping us safe, Anthony.  Thank God.  Thank God for old Chuck Schumer.  Where's Jim Sturges?  Come on in, sir.  Hey, Jim.  What's up, brother?  Take a seat.  Nice to see you guys.  Here's a chair for you. 
[01:41:00]  A microphone.  Hi, buddy.  I know that guy.  We're on the air.  He was, uh, he was, he was the main guy in 21, man.  Right.  21 man?  What?  21 man, yeah.  That was the name of the movie, right, Jim?  21 man, yeah.  How are you, brother?  I'm very good, thanks.  Very well.  Yeah.  Where are you from?  Uh, I'm from London.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just arrived last night.  Did you really?  Yeah.  How was it?  First class, right?  Nah, it was business.  Virgin Atlantic?  What'd you fly?  Business class in, uh, in Delta Airways.  Delta?  So, so you already lived, you already lived November 16th, and now you have to live it 
[01:41:30]  again?  Exactly.  Is that how that works?  Exactly.  Yeah, something like that.  That's so confusing.  What are the lottery numbers, please?  I'm one step ahead.  Oh, that old gag, sorry.  I know.  Please, it is.  We're not that hacky, I promise you.  Hacky crap.  This show stinks.  What is it, like a six hour flight?  I've only done it once.  No, I always think it's about five, six hours, but it's always more like eight, nine hours.  Coming west it is.  Yeah.  If you're coming here, I think going back is probably faster, right?  It's faster going back. 
[01:42:00]  Because you're going into the wind.  That's right.  Which you wouldn't think would make that big a difference.  Exactly.  It's a plane.  It's supposed to deal with the wind.  I once made it from Seattle to New York in an hour and a half, but going out there  was like seven and a half hours.  An hour and a half?  Yeah.  It's no fucking question.  Yeah.  We were doing like Mach 4.  It was some kind of wind current thing we were involved with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like Twilight Zone wind current?  Yeah.  Did you see dinosaurs?  I'm telling you, it happened.  Yeah.  What do they call it when you're in the, uh, what's that?  Jet stream!  You're right.  That's it. 
[01:42:30]  I'm just the angry for no reason guy today.  That's great, though.  I'm going to blurt out like angry things.  That's the way every answer should be given to every chick any guy ever dates.  Jet stream.  You know what I mean?  Just yell it out.  What do you want me to make with potatoes?  Sorry, huh?  All right.  So what's the film that you're in?  It's called Heartless.  Heartless.  And it does look, uh, very, very good.  Unfortunately, uh, I didn't get to see it before you came in.  I'm kind of bummed.  Damn it!  It's about gangs and demons and...  Yeah, you're going to ask me to describe the film now, aren't you? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Is it a Halloween movie?  Just a little bit.  No, I mean...  Just give us a quick synopsis.  Yeah.  It's obviously a lighthearted comedy.  Absolutely, yeah.  That takes...  I mean, it's got it all there for the family.  Yeah.  Yeah.  These are happy, sweet, and lovely demons.  Good for the kids, the children.  Exactly.  Is it frightening?  It's frightening in places, yeah.  I mean, it's not like an all-in-out horror film.  I mean, that's what's kind of sort of special about it, I guess, is that it's basically made  by this crazy kind of amazing artist back in London who's known for his sort of mad poetry  and his plays that he puts on back in London. 
[01:43:30]  So he's known for that.  And so this is the film that he's made after sort of 16 years away from being behind the  camera, you know.  Great.  And he's a really interesting and bizarre, you know, artist who's made this film called  Heartless.  Yeah.  But to describe it is not easy, you know, because, I mean, it's so layered and there's  so many sort of things going on.  And it's not just like your average kind of horror movie, you know.  Yeah.  Is it a spoof on horror movies or is it spoof?  No, not at all. 
[01:44:00]  I mean, it's like...  I don't know.  It's a serious movie.  But so what?  You can still make a...  You can still be kind of a...  No!  Jetstream!  I'm just going to yell at Jimmy all day.  We have this, like, really, really weird gay abusive relationship where I get scolded  in front of company.  Yeah.  Don't yell at Jim Sturgis.  This guy's going to be up for an Oscar.  Yes.  I heard that, right?  For your next film.  I'm telling you right now.  I don't know.  See, I know a little bit about what you're doing.  Okay, that's good.  Roland told me. 
[01:44:30]  Roland said this guy's going to be nominated for an Oscar for his next film, even though  he's here for Heartless today.  Oh, really?  That's how great of an actor Jim Sturgis is.  Oh, I was telling me about that.  That's right.  But we're not talking about that movie.  Maybe he'll come back and talk about that.  Is that next movie in production or is it out?  It comes out in December, January time.  Did you notice he didn't even deny what I had to say?  No, he knows.  I said, I was like...  He knows.  I'm more than happy talking about that.  He's already writing the speech.  Already writing the speech.  It's a nice feeling.  I want an Emmy.  Yeah?  No. 
[01:45:00]  I just wanted to say that.  It feels good to say that and have somebody believe me for a half a second.  For a half a second, he respected you.  I actually didn't believe you.  My acting is hard, man.  Acting is very fucking...  Jimmy does acting.  I love it.  Occasionally, but it's very hard to do.  I admire guys who can really do it.  It's all in the hands.  It's all in the hands.  You don't know what to do with your hands.  I just stick it.  You're stiff.  If you're doing like the robot from Lost in Space, it's not right.  Dude, I watch guys who are doing it well.  When someone's doing dialogue and they're not... 
[01:45:30]  Right now, I'm just talking naturally.  I'm not moving.  You don't move a lot when you talk.  Yeah.  But yet, when I act, I feel like the need to take my arms and go,  Wow!  How was your flight?  And I put my arms...  You're gesturing toward the person.  Yeah, let the audience know that Jimmy is exaggerating with his arms right now.  So I admire guys who can do it well.  It also helps if you're from somewhere else, so...  Because then people don't know...  Why is that?  Well, then people don't know you're messing up words and things like that.  Or they don't know how people act in London.  Like, naturally.  That's not fair.  No, no.  You got to work in your American accent. 
[01:46:00]  Otherwise, you won't get a part in any film.  Do you have an American accent in this one?  Not in this one.  No, this one's all set in East London.  So I was lucky enough to...  In 21, he had the American accent.  How do you do that?  You just kind of copy your accent, I guess.  Yeah, but we couldn't copy you.  You have a coach that kind of helps you through that?  Yeah, so you have to work...  I mean, I did with 21.  I worked with, like, a dialect coach for only about two weeks before we started.  I worked with, like, a dialogue coach.  That's okay.  That's pretty good.  Not bad.  Not bad.  But see, he would know what part of Britain you sell you from. 
[01:46:30]  I know!  You might not sell you from London.  You might sell you from...  What part of Britain was that from?  From New York, Britain.  New York, Britain.  It's from Staffordshire.  From the New York pizza parlor in East London.  I like Australians.  Everything goes up at the end.  Yeah, that's true.  I just did an Australian accent, too.  Did you?  I was in that film, The Legend of the Guardians, where I was playing an Australian owl.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  What's the accent for Australian?  It was the one he just did.  It all goes up at the end.  It just goes up at the end.  And then we realized there was a fire. 
[01:47:00]  And then, like, everything has that lilt up at the end.  It's a silly, stupid accent.  Certain parts of England do that, too.  Birmingham, I think.  Don't they all come up from, like, Liverpool and Birmingham?  No!  No, no.  But why are you?  Don't scare Jim Sturgis.  He's going to be nominated for an Oscar.  We could be friends with an Oscar.  Do Australians come from Australia?  We're in, uh, there's parts of England, too, where the accent comes up at the end, too.  Oh, no, that's true.  That's Birmingham.  Birmingham, yeah, because it all talks like that. 
[01:47:30]  Everything's like that from Birmingham.  He's like, I like Liverpool.  They do that, too.  They get that.  The guy's promoting a movie, and we're all just doing impressions of other people.  How stupid are we?  Well, he can't explain the movie.  No, he can't explain the movie.  He's incapable of explaining his own movie.  I am incapable of explaining the movie.  It's inexplainable.  You know who saw the movie is Roland.  Maybe Roland could help us out.  Oh, God.  He is the worst.  No, I'm serious, though.  I want to do right by Jamie Sturgis.  He's still trying to find Bruce Springsteen somewhere.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where's Bruce?  Bruce! 
[01:48:00]  Bruce!  Here he comes.  Now, we haven't done this in quite a while.  Hey, Roland, we like this Jim Sturgis guy.  I don't know if he likes us, but we like him.  Yes.  No, he's an awesome actor.  He's got a cool accent.  We've been discussing it.  Yeah.  And he knows how to speak American when he has to.  Do an English accent.  Um, he-do!  That's pretty good, though.  I could tell what street he lived on with that.  Yeah, that's exactly.  He's got a zero-ass-ass hole role.  That was like Monty Python shit, man. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, Mrs. Doubtfire.  Oh, yeah.  I thought my dad was in the room.  Say good morning or something for everybody.  Good morning.  Have a cup of coffee.  What the fuck is...  First of all, it's tea.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  That wasn't even close.  Top of the morning to you.  To you, why does everything go like this?  They don't all jump out of planes as they speak.  Jim Sturgis from Heartless. 
[01:49:00]  Listen to Roland describe the movie.  Roland, give us a little synopsis of Heartless, the new movie.  It's really good.  It's scary.  And it's like an inner time with a love story type, I think.  And I love chick flicks, but this will scare you, though.  You're not selling it by saying chick flick at all, so don't say that.  It's a good date movie.  It is a good date movie.  Why will it scare you?  Let's say it like that. 
[01:49:30]  No, we should.  This is a perfect date movie.  There's some scenes where you go...  Anyone under the age of 15 should take their first time, sweetheart,  to go and see this movie.  At this point, Jim's like, I flew all the way from London for this shit.  For this drivel.  But it's really good.  There's some scenes where you go, whoo.  Oh, really?  Out loud?  Yeah.  Don't give away the...  Is there a big reveal that he can't give away?  He already did it, though.  It was a major, major...  It's a really good movie, though.  It is a really good movie, by the way. 
[01:50:00]  I know we're just trying to sell it, but it is a really good movie.  Cool, man.  Good to hear.  How far into it does it get scary, or does it start off frightening immediately?  Kind of pretty soon, doesn't it?  Yeah.  It's basically about a young guy who's basically...  He has a heart-shaped birthmark across the left-hand side of his face,  and he's kind of outcast from society,  and he starts to sort of struggle to make sense of the world,  and he basically starts to see these hooded gangs.  In England, a lot of kids hang around with their hoods up  because we have CCTV footage all over... 
[01:50:30]  Oh, right, right.  All the cameras all around London,  so all the kids all walk around with their hoods over their heads.  And so my character starts thinking that these kids  are actually these sort of demonic creatures  who are causing all the violence around the streets of East London.  Oh, and is he just paranoid, or is it really...  That's the kind of, ooh, at the end.  That's the Roland, ooh.  And he has a heart-shaped...  But, yeah, he has a facial disfigurement,  and he basically makes a deal.  It's a sort of Faustian, a sort of take on the Faustian story 
[01:51:00]  where he makes a deal with this strange sort of devil-like character  to get the birthmark removed from his face  so he can fall in love with the woman of his dreams.  But you can't get something for nothing, my friends, right?  That's right.  There you go.  Roland, what do you say?  Give it your best reaction.  Ooh.  What's wrong with him?  He's a creep.  That's what's wrong with him.  It's a shame this is radio, because his facial expressions is better than me.  I know, it's classic. 
[01:51:30]  It really is classic.  So basically, the guy, the hard thing,  is it like a port wine stain, like one of those people?  Yeah, exactly that, exactly that, yeah.  Those awful stains they have?  Jesus.  Why are you so mean?  You ever see somebody with a port wine stain?  I went to college with one of those kids.  I'm not going to be so mean.  You felt so bad for him.  I didn't.  But he got a lot of pussy.  From who?  Alcoholic chicks?  I don't know.  They didn't understand what that meant.  The kid did really well in half his face.  Half his fucking face.  Oh, you know how mad they must have been when he turned to the left?  I'm like, oh, fuck.  Why did I go out with this zilch?  Oh, him again.  Fuck.  You don't have a port? 
[01:52:00]  No, he's fun.  No, my brother does.  Oh, see?  You watch that?  He's acting.  He's acting.  Like when you said you won an Emmy.  My acting was awful, though.  I know.  He knew I was lying because my eyes opened really wide.  I got an Emmy, Mr. Faber-Sham.  Hey, so the youth are really walking around with their hoods up in London?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a big thing.  And it is scary.  You know, you get like a group of like, I don't know, you know, seven, eight, ten kids 
[01:52:30]  all hanging around the bus stops with their hoods up.  Yeah.  But they're not going to do anything like...  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of knife crime in London.  Well, they're doing bad things.  Black kids or white kids are both?  Both.  Yeah, because here it's usually up north.  A lot of knife crimes?  Yeah, there's a lot of knife crime.  Because there's not a lot of guns.  Yeah, you guys got to legalize guns.  Yeah.  No, we don't have any knives in New York.  No, no, it's a big problem.  No, when there's killings around here, it's guns, my friend.  We know how to shoot things up.  We're all about guns in this country.  We're the Wild West. 
[01:53:00]  That's what everybody thinks of the U.S.  With our gun crimes.  It's so much more glamorous as well.  It really is.  Like stabbing is, you know, you can run away from someone with a knife.  You just got to be faster than the guy with the knife.  Exactly.  But here, you know, it's hard to run a bullet.  Do you guys ever get jealous over there that we have so many guns?  All the time.  Yeah.  Everyone from England just wants to be American.  Do the Barbies carry guns now?  No, I mean, some of them are starting to, but no, it's not a big thing.  Yeah, but some of them just have like a billy club.  A truncheon, yeah.  All right, break it up then.  Yeah.  All right then. 
[01:53:30]  What's all this then?  A truncheon and a very, very loud voice.  Yeah.  And big tall hats.  Those guys are fucking brave though, man.  To walk around trying to break up crimes without a pistol.  How is it brave when there's no guns around?  Because I'm afraid of being beaten up.  I'm not afraid of being shot necessarily, but I don't want to be beaten up.  Your gun?  Yeah, it's your last resort.  You got a stick?  Yeah, but if a guy wants to beat up a cop, he can't shoot him.  Sure he can if he feels like his life's in danger.  Nah, you really can't.  It's just weird that they don't give him guns.  You could beat him up back with a stick.  But the gun's a deterrent though. 
[01:54:00]  Knowing that a guy's going to kick the shit out of you, he might not because he knows you have a pistol.  So they're not looking at the rules when they're going to get shot.  They're like, all right, I can't fuck with this guy.  He's got a gun.  You know, if a guy goes to assault an officer, it's very rare that if he doesn't have a weapon on him that the officer can justifiably shoot him.  But there's many other less lethal ways to take somebody down.  So I would think in England, where, you know, there's not many weapons.  In England, we like to just talk it through. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, you just talk it out.  Yeah, we just talk it out.  Like, Bobby's there with the bad guy with his hood up, just going, you know, all right, go on, man.  Cody's fun.  That's like every cop from Jack the Ripper times.  Yeah, I know.  Fog.  It's like, fog.  I've never been to London.  We've got another one.  I picture a lot of fog in London.  Never been there.  I spent six hours on the way to Kuwait when we were doing Iraq. 
[01:55:00]  We landed in Heathrow for six hours.  Yeah, that was my only time.  And there was fog, right?  I was at the airport.  I was scared of being detained.  I was afraid they were going to detain me for some reason.  Detained.  So this wasn't a complete waste of time.  I wanted Johnny and Jersey to talk about Heartless.  You saw the movie there, Jim Sturgis.  Johnny, don't ruin it, asshole.  Yeah, don't ruin the movie.  But what did you think of the movie?  All I can say is it's a great movie.  Sturgis is just so sympathetic in this film. 
[01:55:30]  Until the, woo, kicks in.  It was a Roland reaction.  And little Jimmy, you do deserve an Oscar.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, Jim Sturgis, Jim Norton.  He met me.  He did meet you?  Oh, shit, that's embarrassing.  Yeah, Jimmy's in a movie terrible.  Tell them about your movie, Jimmy.  What movie?  Well, just two actors talking about their movies.  He's in a movie.  You're in a movie.  A movie?  What movie he's in?  Oh, oh.  The one where you have a port wine birthmark right across the left side of your butt cheek. 
[01:56:00]  He doesn't want to talk about that movie.  I actually didn't know what you meant.  I blocked it out like a childhood rape.  I thought, I just figured me and you would do a bit today.  Oh, I really didn't know.  I thought you might have a movie that you just happen to be in as well.  Okay, I'm looking at the poster for it right now.  Doesn't it just look zany?  What is that bear doing to that guy?  It's Brendan Fraser and the bear is basically doing to him what that film did to the audience.  Fucking his hiney. 
[01:56:30]  Danny, what was the final on Rotten Tomatoes?  As far as box office or rating?  Rating.  Rating on IMDb is a 2.9.  Out of 3?  Out of 10.  So that's almost 3.  That's pretty good.  Uh-oh, Jim Sturge just looked over his shoulder.  That's the number he signed.  He's looking at his people.  Get me out of here.  Help.  He's probably starstruck.  He saw Furry Vengeance.  I did.  That's true.  He signed.  I wondered if that was you in the bear suit. 
[01:57:00]  And Rose did about 18 mil.  Is that all it did?  Wow.  18 million.  That's good.  How did they even pay you?  Oh, boy.  You should have seen the Honeywagon shit trailer they had us in for two weeks.  I played a construction worker.  And it's like, you know, again, I don't expect a fucking Will Smith double-wide, you know,  two-floor trailer.  But how about something?  I was pissing in the sink.  What did you get?  Like, one of those that turns into a tent?  I was pissing in the sink of a Honeywagon.  What's that?  What did you get?  One that, like, has a tent for the top? 
[01:57:30]  No.  Like, people go camping in?  That's exactly what it was.  It's a tractor trailer.  That looks nice.  Oh, it's got a bunch of them, though.  Yeah, but it's not.  They're literally...  Yeah, if each one's a room, that's pretty slim.  It's horrendous.  Do you laugh at the people that have to go on that trailer?  No, because I'm from England, and all our trailers are about that size.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Everything's smaller in England.  What about the...  That's a big lorry.  We call them trucks.  Right.  But for big...  I think he's, like, right.  This guy's great. 
[01:58:00]  But for, like, if you're the lead, like, obviously, you know, Brooke Shields and Brendan Fraser had  fucking trailer trailers.  Of course they did.  They're the stars.  And they should.  But it was the other guys, like, lower, who had a lot more than fucking dialogue.  How big of a trailer did the bear have?  I didn't see the bear.  You didn't see the bear's trailer?  I did not see them.  They did have a real bear there.  I understand he was the panic.  But our Patrice was fucking miseric comedian, I know, too.  And we both were just commiserating. 
[01:58:30]  He was fucking miserable.  I was, too.  Two weeks in a fucking honey wagon.  For what?  For that shoot.  For that shoot?  Yeah, it's just the worst.  You mispronounce shit.  I keep saying honey wagon, but that's what they call them.  Hey, Jim, you do some singing, too?  Because you got some music in this movie, Heartless?  Yeah, I did.  Well, the director wrote a load of songs, and we sort of did some music together.  So I sort of performed two songs in the film, yeah.  Are they heart songs or kind of love songs, really? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, one's just kind of electronic sort of song, which is the title track to the film,  which sort of plays at the end credits.  And then there's a film called The Other Me, which is a really sad kind of acoustic sort  of song that we wrote.  Is this the first time you ever sang publicly or no?  You're sensitive.  No, it's not, no.  Well, I used to be in a band a long time ago, about five years ago.  Here's the inside of the honey wagon.  That's Patrice.  Oh, you have it there.  Yeah, he looks pretty fucking miserable.  In general. 
[01:59:30]  That's every day.  Just look at poor Patrice in his fucking, in his stupid 1907 hat.  What is he doing?  Oh, how miserable does he look?  Oh, is he miserable?  And what, did you just have to sit on a couch and just do nothing in there?  Literally, there's nothing to do.  I honestly was just pissing in the sink, because there's no toilet in there.  And you've got to piss a lot.  How is there no toilet?  Jimmy has to pee a lot.  I wouldn't know.  I just stood up at the sink.  I would whiz in my own sink.  Oh, my God.  He's laughing at you.  Oh, he knows.  He's done with this.  You've got a lot of press to do today, Jim?  Not too much. 
[02:00:00]  No, we've got a few bits, a few kind of roundtable interviews we've got to do later.  Oh, roundtable for print journalism?  Yeah, for the print stuff, yeah.  Yeah, we had to.  They sent us to cover Comic-Con this year, me and her.  And we went to her.  I say that every place we went out, no one's ever questioned why I call Sam her.  They just think I have an ugly kind of mulatto girlfriend.  And they gave us a bunch of roundtables.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Microphones.  What fucking douchebags we felt like. 
[02:00:30]  Really?  Oh, it was fucking...  Who was it, the one?  Simon Pegg?  Sigourney Weaver and Jeffrey Camber were at the one.  It was for whatever they just did.  And there was five of us at the table.  Is this for Furry Vengeance?  No.  This was for us.  This was for the radio show.  For the radio station.  Oh, okay, right.  Jimmy does a lot of stuff.  And what was the...  Oh, you were asking the question.  We were supposed to interview them.  Okay.  But the publicity department here sent us out and got us roundtables, which is for print.  And so it was everyone, all these bloggers and journalists just putting their fucking 
[02:01:00]  recorders out.  And me and Dummy sitting there with a fucking handheld mic.  It was fucking...  I couldn't have been more...  It was a plastic dick.  And I was just holding it back and forth.  It was humiliating.  And then like the next days on Jay Leto.  Jimmy has a very strange life.  It was humiliating.  He's got a really weird life, Jim Norton.  Hey, we're talking to Jim Sturges.  He was also in Across the Universe.  I still haven't seen that fucking film.  I hear it's really good, too.  Yeah, there's a bit of singing in that one as well.  Did you sing a song in that? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, I sang a couple of songs in that.  Which ones?  They were all Beatles songs.  No, I know that.  So what did I sing?  All You Need Is Love.  All You Need Is Love.  Girl, Strawberry Fields.  I've Just Seen A Face.  God, there was a whole bunch of them.  I'm going to have to get that movie.  Yeah, that was a good time.  That was the first time I ever came to New York.  I'd never been to America before.  Who'd you play in that?  I didn't see it.  I played Jude, like all the characters are characters from Beatles songs.  So there's like a Jude and a Jojo and a Prudence and a Sadie and a Dr. Robert. 
[02:02:00]  They filmed it around New York, too.  Yeah, it was all filmed around in New York, yeah.  Did Fiona Apple, because she had a cool video years ago for Across the Universe.  Was she involved with that film?  No, she had a great version of Across the Universe.  Yeah, I loved it.  Very good, yeah.  It was a really weird video where there was like violence happening and it was kind of,  it was slow motion violence happening around her.  Violence.  I'll just make that as a statement as opposed to a point of conversation.  That's a period, not a semicolon.  Move right along.  Here, I want a little taste of Jim Sturgis.  You got a little taste of him?  Oh. 
[02:02:30]  With eyes closed.  Damn.  Jesus.  Damn.  You're not going to play the whole song, yeah?  Do you get embarrassed hearing yourself sing?  Yeah, kind of, yeah.  Sounds good, man.  That sounds good.  Are you kidding me?  Roland, sing the same song.  You want to hear embarrassment.  Go ahead.  What song is it?  Headphones.  I don't have headphones.  Oh, jeez.  Just sing any Beatles song, because Jim Sturgis is embarrassed, so we got to. 
[02:03:00]  Hey, Jude.  No, no, no, just Strawberry Fields.  Go ahead.  Oh, um, Strawberry Fields forever?  See, you're not embarrassed anymore.  See how we do that?  And the way his voice...  Just like the end of Heartless, I was scared, man.  Yes.  His voice trails off, it's scary, because it's not like he's singing, Hey, Jude.  Hey, Jude.  I know people don't like hearing their own voices, but I got to say, that's a great version of Strawberry Fields.  Yeah, all the music was great.  There was an amazing...  He did a great job with it, man.  T-Bone Burnett, do you know that guy? 
[02:03:30]  Sure.  He did all the music for it.  He did all the music for it.  Did you get to meet any of the Beatles?  Ringo.  I met Ringo.  Did you?  Yeah.  Why?  Was he on set?  So he didn't really meet a Beatles?  They don't really respect him.  Yeah, does that count?  Yeah, of course that counts.  Yeah, man.  He's Ringo.  He was amazing.  How'd you meet them?  He was at a screening of the film, and me and the actress who played Lucy, Evan Rachel Wood,  we were having...  We just happened to be having dinner together in Los Angeles, and then Julie Tame, when the director,  phoned us and said, you have to get down to the screening, Ringo Starr's here. 
[02:04:00]  So we ran in, and we ran in late.  Was he tearing tickets?  But we spent the whole movie watching him, watching the movie, you know.  And you spoke to him after?  Yeah, we spoke to him, yeah.  And I have a picture of him kind of doing the peace sign, but he's got his baseball cap on it,  and he looks more like Steven Spielberg than he does Ringo Starr.  Did people know he was there, or was it kind of he snuck in?  Yeah, I think there was him and his wife and George Harrison's wife, and there was a whole bunch of them  in the world of that, yeah.  Wow. 
[02:04:30]  We almost met a Beatle, right, Ant?  When?  We were invited to some Beatle thing, thinking all the Beatles were going to show up, and  then it was like...  Oh, there's only two left.  It was like one girlfriend that sort of was with one of the members of the band.  Yeah.  That's the closest we got.  Yeah, we...  And we really thought we were in.  Didn't you see Paul McCartney here or something?  Uh, yeah, I've talked to Paul McCartney, it's no big deal.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he's just a regular guy, he shits like the rest of us.  He probably doesn't, though.  He probably doesn't.  Before he shits, he probably lays down a stack of bills and stands on it. 
[02:05:00]  He's very wealthy.  Yeah, he really is.  By bills, I meant like the end of hats.  Boo!  All right, well...  Have we promoted Heartless enough?  This really is going to be a good film.  We're in a weird mood today, Jim.  No, that's good.  What's the next movie that's coming out?  The next one's called The Way Back.  The Way Back?  Yeah.  Oh, right, I actually did get rid of that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no demons or singing in that movie.  No?  It's a World War II movie, eh?  Yeah, it's all about...  And it has Oscar buzz already, right, Roland? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, Peter Weir directed.  Huh?  Yeah, Peter Weir directed the movie.  Peter Weir?  Wow.  I hope it has a happy ending this time.  It's pretty epic, man.  See?  What do you mean?  The Nazis win.  I understood.  I'm teasing, of course.  Why are they giving it Oscar buzz already?  If you see the trailer, it's phenomenal.  Everybody even...  There's a lot of trailers that look great.  Not really, though.  No.  But you see Jim's acting, and then everybody else is...  Is he going to win an Oscar?  He get nominated.  Huh?  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  Just from the trailer? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  He's getting nominated?  Yeah, from the trailer.  Do you know how nice it is to hear someone just saying, well, you see Jim's acting?  I know he's talking about him, but I don't care.  I'm just basking in that for a second.  And you are just...  What that must feel like to hear.  That's a great...  That Jim was terrific in that movie.  Well, you know.  Do a lot of acting.  You're good, Jimmy.  I stink.  My left eye blinks a lot.  I'm completely uncomfortable to look at.  Oh, it's fucking hideous.  What do you...  You do this?  I just do it involuntarily for my whole life.  I've done it.  You haven't noticed.  You should have been in Heartless with it.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe.  If a roll calls for a twitch, I gotta fucking... 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But if it's anything that you have to enjoy what you're looking at...  You're not getting romantic leading man roles?  Imagine having a port wine birthmark and a twitching line.  He's the twitch king, man.  He's alienated from the rest of society.  He's the twitch king, Jimmy.  I'm fucking horrible.  Really?  Oh.  I just saw photos of myself from the fucking Florentine roast.  What a fat neck twat.  Yeah.  Smiling and talking.  And I just have a fucking big blubber roll into my fucking...  Ugh.  He doesn't like himself.  He's got, yeah.  But you know how?  Did you see yourself on film?  You're critical. 
[02:07:00]  He's a handsome dude, so for him it's not as bad.  But even, like, no matter what it is about you...  I'm not saying that in a queer way.  I'm just saying, you know...  If I had to look like anybody in the room, it'd be you.  I'll be second.  You'd be first.  I'd look like you if I could.  Thank you.  Sam's a distant third.  Oh, my God.  Where's Iraq fall in that?  Iraq with his fucking moldy smelling shirt.  Old moldy shirt.  Moldy shirt.  His shirt smells like...  Like, you ever have your shirt washed and then you leave it in the washer overnight and 
[02:07:30]  it begins to dry naturally?  No, that's not good.  That's his laundry method.  That's how Iraq decided to come in today.  I think that's his shirt.  Is that my right, Eric?  Does your shirt smell moldy?  It didn't to me.  Well, of course it never does to the person wearing it.  Oh, my God.  We just saw your belly when you did that.  Oh, God.  We have a camera in that room so we could see Iraq.  Oh, my God.  So we see, like, his whole body.  Wow.  And he just pulled his shirt up to smell it.  I don't know what that was.  Yeah.  Look at you pull the cover off a giant carp.  That was a big white belly. 
[02:08:00]  I want someone to smell your shirt.  Roll a question for Jim Sturgis.  About Heartless.  Yeah, go ahead.  Something we didn't cover.  I want to make sure we promote this movie properly for him.  It is.  I just say if you go out this Friday and see Heartless, it's a great movie, though.  You'll enjoy it.  Cool.  It genuinely is like nothing you've seen before, honestly.  It's completely out there.  Yeah, that's why I keep pushing it, because I don't want people to think it's just another  horror movie.  It sounds like it's a little different.  It's better because it's English director and everything, so it's more.  So that's better? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  The director's a really, honestly, a phenomenal artist.  And he's known back in London for all his artwork.  And he's a kind of real renaissance man.  Like, he's a poet, and he writes children's stories, and he's a photographer.  Renaissance?  That's such a great way to say it, right?  I know.  And they always say things better than we do.  We've fucked up your language, sir.  How would you say it?  Renaissance.  Renaissance.  Renaissance.  Everything has to be nasally and hard in America.  Renaissance.  I like aluminum.  Yeah.  We call it aluminum.  That makes no sense.  It doesn't.  That makes no sense.  Why am I yelling at you? 
[02:09:00]  Jenny!  Jet string!  My favorite is schedule, myself.  I like the schedules.  What do you say?  Schedule.  Schedule.  Just hard, fucking nasally shit.  Schedule.  Schedule.  But we have guns!  And you got fog.  Yes.  A lot of fog in Heartless.  Just say there's a lot of fog.  There is a bit of fog in Heartless.  A lot of fog machines were used.  Yeah, that's creepy.  So it's not even out yet?  The other film.  Friday.  How'd you see it?  He's rolling.  I'm a heartless.com.  He downloaded it illegally. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, no.  No, I didn't.  No.  Yeah, Roland and two Somalians actually stand outside on a blanket and sell films of people  that have come in here to promote it.  Did you sign this?  That would suck.  Oh, that would be awful.  All right.  Let's get Jim out of here.  All right.  He hasn't slept yet.  He's a busy man.  Take a break.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Jim Sturgis, thank you, man.  Heartless is on Friday.  And not that you're here to promote the other one, but I actually, before Roland mentioned  it, The Way Back is the other one.  That's out in December or January.  So just look for that as well.  World War II film.  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  Which is getting Oscar buzz already.  Very cool, man.  Cool.  Thank you, guys.  Enjoy New York, brother.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Okay, Anthony.  Mornings.  Ron and Fez.  Middays.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Waiting for the arrival of Pat Cooper.  He's got a book coming out.  How dare you say, how dare me?  How dare you say, how dare me? 
[02:10:30]  That's the name of his book.  Yeah, it's one of his famous quotes.  We love Pat Cooper.  Yeah, I love him.  It definitely saves my voice when he comes in.  Oh, my God.  Just sit back and listen.  I don't have to talk because I can't.  Who told you that?  You can't get away the next ways.  What?  And Jim Sturgis.  He was all right, man.  Yeah, yeah, he was.  I was kind of beating on him.  I don't know why you would do that.  Well, because I didn't know him from A Hole in the Wall.  He's pretty famous. 
[02:11:00]  And I didn't know he was a fucking limey.  Did you know he was a fucking limey?  Honestly, I did not because I saw 21, which the movie was good.  I liked the book.  And he talked like a real normal person.  But he was really good in 21.  Yeah.  And that across the universe, I want to see.  I don't know why I haven't seen it yet.  But I hear that's kind of a weird movie.  It's kind of almost like a musical or something.  Yes.  A little strange.  I think I woke up once, and that movie was on, right?  Uh-huh.  So I'm watching it, and I went, holy shit, what is this immense piece of crap? 
[02:11:30]  Oh, you don't like it?  Ugh!  They're just all singing and dancing, and it's Beatles songs, but done poorly.  Was it good?  Like, he was good.  Obviously, I'm not even saying it to kiss anyone's ass.  Well, he's long gone.  You don't have to say that.  Well, no.  He was singing Strawberry Fields and shit, and it sounded good.  He's got a good voice.  Yeah.  And he's got that English thing going, so you've seen Beatles.  You've seen the Beatles.  Yes, but that movie was-  Was it like Glee?  Was it Beatles Glee?  It was more like-  I don't even know what Glee is still. 
[02:12:00]  I don't really understand Glee.  You ever see the movie Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?  Nope.  With Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees, and that's pretty much what I felt like I was watching.  They're singing their way through the movie?  Yeah.  Singing their way through the storyline or something?  Yeah.  Was it kind of like Tommy?  A rock opera?  Are you dubbing it a rock opera?  The movie.  The movie Tommy.  Yes.  Where everything was just played out in song?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hate that shit.  Like, like-  I hate that shit.  Tommy. 
[02:12:30]  Tommy.  I saw the play, Tommy.  I saw the play on-  Right there on Broadway.  And that was all right, but the movie sucked.  Is there anything worse than musicals?  No, I hate the musical.  Every once in a while, you drag to a musical on Broadway.  It's like, when are they going to stop singing and talking?  No.  Stop.  I'm more comfortable with talking.  Yeah.  Just talk.  I hate when they sing dialogue.  They just burst in a song.  Right when you kind of forget you're watching a music, right? 
[02:13:00]  And all of a sudden, like, the piano starts.  Oh, my God.  Right.  Hear me.  Boom.  Boom.  But, like, you knew these songs.  You know what?  You know what?  I got to bring up a memory.  Yeah?  You know, I had to fucking miss Christmas with my family because I had to be the guy that  played Tommy.  What?  For the special weekend programming around Christmas.  What?  I'm like, you're forcing me to stay in Rochester, New York, when my family's on Long Island,  just so I could push play on a fucking Tommy CD? 
[02:13:30]  Wow.  Sorry, I just remembered that.  Family is celebrating Christmas when you still cared about Christmas,  and I'm in Rochester, and it wasn't...  They didn't need me.  You got fucked, my friend.  We had to play it from beginning to end.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy!  Tommy!  Tommy!  That was one of my favorite ones.  Favorite bits ever.  I know.  Dice.  Tommy!  I don't even know if people have the patience to sit through the Tommy bit again. 
[02:14:00]  What was the other one?  The lady that couldn't...  Is that the same bit?  Iraq, help me out.  Oh, my God.  I'm all over the place.  Iraq, where is Iraq?  Remember the woman that wanted to win the tickets?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And we made believe we couldn't hear her for an hour straight,  and she just refused to fucking...  Yeah.  Fucking second.  Oh, God, Iraq.  I thought for a second he was pulling his speed on us  and just looped the video of him in front of it and left the studio. 
[02:14:30]  Like, speed.  But you see a quick edit of, like, a donut heading to his face.  Just for, like, one frame.  That trips him up.  It's like, hey, wait a minute.  He picked that donut up, and then it was gone.  But it was really just him eating it that quickly?  We thought it was a film glitch.  I just said how much I like a bit, and I don't know anything about the bit.  No.  That's wonderful.  What was it?  It was for some horseshit tickets.  God.  It was a wrong number.  And it goes on for a member. 
[02:15:00]  What?  Was her name Antoinette?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You left her on live during the commercials?  Oh, that shit.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  I don't remember that, though.  It was hello.  Oh, hello.  She said hello a million times, right?  Oh, I'm here.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm here.  Why can't you hear me?  I'm here.  I'm here.  For Rick Springfield tickets?  Yeah, for lousy Rick Springfield tickets.  Yeah.  Cousin Scott remembers everything.  They basically give away those tickets if you fucking buy $20 worth of groceries. 
[02:15:30]  And she's waiting online for an hour to try to get them from us.  That fucking glee.  What is that about?  Glee?  We should know about pop culture.  I don't know.  It's like some kind of musical show.  I don't get it.  They have this drama, and then they do like a musical number.  Tell Sam to not...  No, don't bother, Sam.  The show stinks on life.  He's running down the hall.  Look at Sam's running.  You're not on the air today, Sam.  I know what Glee is about.  We're punishing Sam because of his 19-inch TV.  He's not going to be on the show today.  My backpack. 
[02:16:00]  My backpack.  We're punishing you.  Here comes Sam with his backpack.  We're punishing you.  After your 19-inch TV, you do not deserve airtime today.  No.  No.  We'll get your TV update tomorrow.  Tomorrow, I say.  Tomorrow.  I said you're not on the air today.  What is it?  What is Glee?  That means it turns my gun.  Pat Cooper is coming up.  Coming up.  Thank God.  He's yelling at the security.  Jesus.  Where did Jimmy go? 
[02:16:30]  Did he just give up?  I wouldn't blame him.  What?  I'm on the air.  Jimmy's in a meeting?  An informal meeting.  About what?  I didn't sit in on his meetings.  That's Mr. Norton's business.  He can't just have a meeting?  Well, he's got to, you know, people have to talk to people.  Oh, boy.  Pat Cooper looks angry.  Oh, he's always angry.  Look at him.  He looks constipated.  Did you just have a meeting?  A meeting?  We were just chatting, but he's like, all right, I know you're going to go back on the air.  Who were you chatting with? 
[02:17:00]  Bladder, but he makes sense.  Disappointed.  My God, you've cut out his brain, you bloody baboons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got a scar.  They got to you, didn't they?  No, no, no, no, but he, you know.  They got to you.  No, not, no, he's only, uh.  Oh, not that guy again.  Why did you bring him, Pat?  Oh, that guy.  I remember that guy.  Hi, Pat.  What awful pants that guy has on.  Gentlemen, how are you? 
[02:17:30]  Pat Cooper.  What's up, Pat Cooper?  How are you, sir?  How are you, my friend?  All right.  Am I here legally?  Yes, you are.  Oh, yes, legally.  Just want to be here legally.  Everything's fine.  How's the baby?  Baby's fine, Mr. Cooper.  I introduced my son to Pat Cooper on the street.  I don't like being called that, by the way.  Excuse me.  See, the baby?  I was making self-deprecating humor without the humor.  I just left the humor out.  Me and Mr. Cooper had a moment on the streets of New York.  He met my wife and my beautiful baby.  Excuse me.  You're talking to me, sir. 
[02:18:00]  Yes, I am.  You guys want to come to one of the book signings?  What?  I didn't want to come to one of the book signings.  Holy shit.  Are you, Harvey?  You're not on mic.  You're not on mic.  Let him ask.  What?  You should be on mic.  I'm getting nervous about it.  You should be on mic.  What is going on?  If you're going to plug something.  See, if you want to plug something, you get on mic.  Don't pay attention.  Be a professional like Pat Cooper.  He's a professional.  Why did you bring him back?  I have to bring him back.  Why?  Because he's responsible for a lot of things in that book, my friend.  All right. 
[02:18:30]  You can wait outside.  I supplied the material.  He built the house.  That's the truth.  Because I don't know how to write it.  He's babbling into thin air.  What is that guy in the corner saying?  He's talking, but it's not on the air because he's not anywhere near a microphone.  Yeah, but he's bitching about something.  We're on the air.  Yes, we're on the air.  Send up a sign.  A red sign or something.  Send up a flare.  Send up a flare.  Hey, thanks.  What was that guy bitching about? 
[02:19:00]  Excuse me?  Him.  Yeah, he's...  Do me a favor.  He's not here.  Well, that's what I'm hoping for.  Pat Cooper, the book looks terrific.  I remember that...  All right.  This is the cheap bastards we get back to the promotion.  Pat said the hardcover is out.  We get the softcover cheap bastard promotion.  Yeah, yeah.  Why do we...  I'm living on 70th.  I am, yeah.  Did I just see you in a movie?  Probably if you had your eyes held open really wide.  No, I know.  Was it called Furry Vengeance?  Because I cheer when I see you.  I see it on air, see? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, that's a nicer version of the book.  Well, we did that because, you know...  Wrap someone in the head with that one.  When did you guys become popular in my life?  I got a life to lead.  We were bitching because we wanted the hard copy of the book.  You got a right to bitch.  We don't want the soft copy.  Shut up.  It says advanced reading copy.  I like this.  First of all, thank you for having me on.  Now that we've been on the air for 15 minutes.  Second of all, now your ratings will go right through the roof.  I'm hoping.  But not to people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I haven't heard the word ratings in years. 
[02:20:00]  Of what's ratings?  Yeah, they don't have it here on satellite radio.  I think Pat came in six months ago to promote this book.  Yes, we talked about it.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  All right.  I have never had an ego problem.  But I'm going to tell you this.  Uh-oh.  That's...  This is nailed.  I nailed it.  It's one of the best books out there.  I don't care if I sell one, but I know what I did.  It's a dynamo.  It's a museum piece.  You got a forward by Jerry Lewis, which is great.  No, but you know what he did? 
[02:20:30]  What did he do?  He called me up Wednesday, and he says to me, Pat, you wrote a great book.  That's why I forwarded before the book.  Come on.  He never read it.  He trusted me.  Wow.  Yeah.  And I said, Jerry, he says, Pat, I know you a lot of years.  You've been in your house.  He says, you're a naturally funny guy.  Absolutely.  This book says it.  That's great.  I'm not coming.  I'm not listening.  I'm not looking for accolades, but these guys, what do they know?  What do they know?  They're young.  We don't know anything.  You're on your way.  You're the future.  This is all better.  I'm not going to do this in a gondola in Italy for about a week.  That's it.  It doesn't matter to me. 
[02:21:00]  This is your first book, right?  Biting my time.  First one, right?  Your first book?  It's the first and only.  After this, I'm dying.  What?  Oh, you've been singing that for years.  What?  Do you mind?  I swear to God.  You know something?  Hang out for a little while.  It's just remarkable how this country is being held hostage in this fucking building.  I mean, I never saw stupidity.  I mean, I could have come in here and did whatever I wanted.  You know, all you got to do is see if you move at an angle, they'll arrest you.  Right.  No reason at all.  Guys, so why are you moving like that?  I have a peg leg. 
[02:21:30]  Do you mind?  They don't know.  You have to go through security or something?  You got to go to two people.  You got to go to the 36 to get a tag.  Frick and frack.  That's not frick and frack.  It's a disgraziata.  Oh, what's that?  Because we're making people that we don't even know hold us hostage.  And they talk about everyday bullies, about bullying.  Cyberbullying.  This book tells you what you do to a bully.  Tell him to go fuck himself.  And tell him to step outside.  He goes, we are outside.  All right, then step inside.  Frick and assholes.  I'm telling you.  You know, it's a pleasure to die. 
[02:22:00]  It's a pleasure to leave the planet.  It's a pleasure to leave the planet.  But you know what's going to happen?  How strong the Arabs are?  They're probably in heaven.  They got us by the balls.  Oh, that's not good.  Yeah, St. Anthony's now.  He's asking for ID.  Will you stop reading while I'm doing my great stuff?  I'm just looking at it.  I think it's great.  Stick your hands off that book.  Did you look at a whole box of these?  Like, to look at a whole box of your book.  I got them.  I got about 300 in my house.  But isn't this great?  I'm slipping at an angle.  Like a hoarder.  Oh, mother of God. 
[02:22:30]  I'm so happy to be here.  You guys are still surviving.  That means that I still got a chance.  Barely.  We're barely surviving.  By our fingernails, we're hanging on.  By the way, the Pat Cooper is not forever.  Because you know why?  Fucking business.  You know why?  Nobody wants the job.  Exactly.  Pat did class.  He got class.  He walks around with a little baby on 70th Street.  I cry emotionally.  I said, he's fucking human.  Yeah, of course I am.  You saw him as a human being?  You saw that side of him.  That's unique.  How many people get to see that side?  Plugging your book signing tonight.  Forget it.  No, it's a good one.  Why weren't we invited to the big book signing tonight? 
[02:23:00]  Tonight, it's at 7 o'clock.  It's on Borders, Columbus Circle, which is in the Time Warner building.  It's a great place.  It's a great place because you're indoors the entire time.  There's no outside line.  It's all inside.  Yeah.  The great Pat Cooper at 7 tonight will be signing books.  Thank you.  You want people to go there?  I love you, huh?  You want people to go there to the book signing?  Yes.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  I never thought this would happen.  Never.  Why not?  Because I wasn't interested in writing a story, but this is not only a story.  It says something to young people. 
[02:23:30]  Stay away from Opie and Anthony.  And then you'll be successful.  Yeah.  You've got some great pictures in here with all the big stars.  I've got more in here for another $11.  Oh, really?  There's more pictures in the hardcover?  I've got to make a living, right?  How you doing, buddy?  I'm doing kind of, buddy.  It's weird to see Pat in a military uniform.  What do you mean in a military?  I was a killer.  Wow, look at that.  Oh, let's see.  I went to Korea.  I shot anything that moved.  I shot nine monkeys.  I thought they were human.  What is this here? 
[02:24:00]  A hotel?  Wow.  And here's things differently than we do.  I know.  It's my wife.  I lost eight years ago.  What a lady.  What a lady.  What a lady.  I lost.  And you know something that's funny?  I don't know how to be single.  Really?  I've been single eight years.  I don't know.  You take your dick out and you point it at somebody.  No, no, no.  I don't have any dick.  It's over.  The thing shrunk.  Kalamata kills everything.  Kalamata.  It shrunk?  No, I got erection of the skin.  The minute she died, I think she put the curse on me.  You're not going to do anything to anybody else.  And that was it. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, she put the malachia on your balls?  What happened?  I don't need it no more.  I'm beyond that.  You see, let me explain something to you what happens.  When you're young and everything, you're married, you got your wife.  After you finish sex, you go, ah, ah.  Now, when you're 82 and you pee, you go, ah, ah.  So I enjoy peeing.  I get up two, three times in the middle of the night.  It's like having an orgasm.  I go, ah.  And it's easy in your pajamas to find your pecker.  Oh, yeah?  But if you got a zipper, you'll become a Jew in about five minutes and you'll pick it  up for the wrong time.  You know what?  Don't get your schmeckle caught in the air. 
[02:25:00]  Schmeckles don't mean nothing.  See, when you're my age, it don't mean shit.  You know what I mean?  Shit.  Breathing.  Peeing.  You know, you got words now.  We never had prostate.  And you got words.  They said cancer.  You got words.  We never fucking heard.  Because these assholes are eating the wrong food.  If you eat food of your culture, if you're a fucking horse, you don't give me a steak  sandwich.  If you're Italian, you eat Italian.  If you're Jewish, you eat Jewish.  No.  So the Jewish people say, we got trouble.  You keep eating that fucking Chinese food.  Your intestines can't handle it.  What is your problem?  How would you like to be an intestine? 
[02:25:30]  And comes Egg Fug Young down here.  Egg Fug Young.  And the fucking intestine's going, what the hell is that for Christ's sakes?  Then you're on the ball and you're going, Jesus, I got a problem.  Stop eating that garden.  Chinese people eat because they got Chinese intestines, for Christ's sakes.  I love this science that we're getting.  Science is guaranteed.  I'm not a doctor.  It's not science.  It's guaranteed.  Fuck it right.  There you go.  Some of the best quotes I've ever heard.  You're going to tell you something?  They're going to teach guaranteed in class.  I know.  Exactly. 
[02:26:00]  They got Chinese intestines.  Chinese intestines.  You just got to eat.  Nobody believes that.  I've never heard this, though, before.  Because you've got a show with guests that don't say shit.  You're the first one I've heard that with this theory that cultures have to eat their own food.  But see.  But let me ask you a question.  When we were growing up in the 30s and 40s and 50s.  I remember.  You ate the food of your culture.  Yeah.  I mean, we never knew what an appetizer.  We're not fucking appetizing.  My father says, why do I need something to get me hungry?  I'm fucking hungry now.  Give me that macaroni now. 
[02:26:30]  You want a salad?  Then I go yesterday, right?  I got $12 for a tree-colored salad.  I says, can you give me two colors for $6?  I said, I want tree fucking colors.  What must I pay for tree colors?  He goes, well, I can't take the colors out.  Why?  I want a one-colored salad.  Who the fuck told you I need tree-colored salad?  This is why we're dropping dead.  It's just a salad.  This is why we're dropping dead.  But what about like other cultures like Indians?  So you think they eat Indian food? 
[02:27:00]  Listen to me.  This is why we're fighting wars.  We don't understand each other's culture.  I mean, a guy walks around with a turban, that's his fucking culture.  A guy walks around with a camel, leave him the fuck alone.  You know, he goes on the sands.  He's in the Sahara.  He goes from town to town.  God bless him.  We got to open our minds.  We got to free you.  I don't want to be fucking free.  I'm on a fucking desert.  I need my fucking camel.  We're nice.  We got nine broads here.  I don't have to worry about nothing.  We don't want to know anything.  We want to free everybody.  So we got to leave everyone alone. 
[02:27:30]  Well, you know what's happening now?  In a reversal, we are now being captured.  So now we are going to be the fucking enemy.  We're going to surrender to everybody.  So we're going to, well, the Chinese are taking over.  I'm telling you, without firing a shot, you'll take away our cell phones.  You'll take away the way we can do it and the computer.  We're in deep shit.  Yeah.  We don't have to fire guns no more.  We just say, take it away, you toys.  I give up.  I don't give a fuck. 
[02:28:00]  Just give me a place to sleep, but give me my fucking toys.  Yeah.  I'm going to have mom with that.  We had no toys.  No?  Toys.  Toys.  Do you have a cell phone now?  I had the worst one ever made.  Yeah?  It's nice.  It's statics.  And it's, you know, and I go, can I hear you?  Can you hear me?  Because I'm deaf.  This is the new one, by the way.  I bought the six months ago.  I'm hearing Sinatra.  And it's the one, oh, thank God.  The woman said to me, a lovely lady, she said, this is the best hearing aid in the world out of Denmark.  Oh, nice, huh?  But only people that speak are tuned, if ain't you, can I understand? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's tuned to that frequency.  You know what's wrong with these two guys?  They don't fucking get it.  That's why they're on the air.  They can't hurt us.  Why?  Because they don't get it.  We're fucking laughing, Pat.  So how does that work?  Do you have to plug it?  It just goes in your ear and behind?  Or it just goes...  It's going to turn my ass in about five minutes.  Yeah, this is the new one.  It's a rubber here and a thing in here.  And they give you sections, small, medium, and large.  It's like buying soda. 
[02:29:00]  You know, so the guy says, can you hear me?  I said, wait a minute.  Beep, beep, beep.  Okay, wait a minute.  Beep, I got you on second.  The guy goes, what the hell you got in your ear?  It's the new thing.  It's technology.  But when you put the cell phone there, can't hear nothing.  Oh, nothing.  You take it out.  You hope you make a novena that somebody's yelling fire, and you hear the fucking thing.  I got the worst, worst, cheapest phone.  Why'd you do that?  I don't even have one of these goddamn things.  I don't have a computer.  No.  Why don't you have a computer?  I want to look at a blank wall, you stay out of trouble. 
[02:29:30]  I don't need all this crap.  And let me tell you something, man.  This here has got us.  We don't have, we forgot the trees.  Remember the fucking trees?  Sure.  We forgot the animals walking through the fucking trees.  We're over there.  You want to go and see a lion?  I can see one on my computer.  Yeah, would you?  Why?  You can't touch it, you dumb fuck.  I mean, before you know it, you're going to hump your fucking set.  Well.  They're going to say, when do you want to get laid?  And you're computed.  Say, and then a broad will come on the thing, and you get laid in imagination.  That's fucking crazy. 
[02:30:00]  It's called pout talk.  Did you see what happened there?  I watched last night, that girl that took over one in a hundred, that game show.  No.  Well, anyway, I don't know what her name is.  She's selling her ass.  Yeah?  Every move she makes is this way, that way.  I'm going, what about the fucking game?  What about one in one hundred?  Who's winning the game?  She goes, and then, you got eight thousand.  And she moves her ass.  You got thirty thousand.  I said, when the fuck is the game?  They put a woman on, which is wonderful.  They cost to fuck your brain up.  Nobody's paying attention to the game.  No.  That's why the guy loses.  He goes, it's number B, the winner? 
[02:30:30]  And he's looking at her ass.  It's number A, because you're looking at her ass.  Asshole.  Stupid.  That's for people whose...  They cost pussy rules.  That's for people whose dicks are still working.  There's no dicks anymore, you sick bastard.  What happened?  There's no more dicks.  It's now calm.  It's medical.  It's now your penis.  Ah, okay.  Why?  Because on game shows, you can say, well, it's my penis.  See, now we're educated.  Ed Sullivan, you couldn't say.  Damn Yankees.  You're going to say you're damn Yankees here.  Damn Yankees. 
[02:31:00]  What the fuck are you wrong?  Are we stupid?  It's damn Yankees.  You couldn't say damn.  Now, because America got educated, we cannot say fuck.  Oh.  Ooh.  Yeah.  I was scared.  We've been saying it.  The caveman said it.  Of course.  It's real language.  Why can't we...  We're not allowed to have real language.  People are very scared.  You got assholes in our fucking place in Washington.  Only they fuck.  You can't.  Only they fuck.  That's it.  When they say it's wrong and they're banging everything that moves.  They fuck me in the ass.  Yeah.  We got rid of the Italian finally. 
[02:31:30]  A senora.  She travels with her grandkid, a five-year-old, in a fucking limousine.  I'm 82.  I can't get a bicycle.  You fucking believe this?  You're 82.  Yeah.  Next birthday.  Wow.  It's called eating the food of your culture.  See?  Yeah, but I don't have a culture.  I'm a mutt.  Yeah, you're right.  When you get 82, talk to me.  But I'm a mutt.  What about people that don't really know their culture?  They're like me.  They're not something.  They're lost.  That's it.  They're on a fucking Sahara Desert without a camel.  That's what it is.  They can't eat the food of their culture.  They don't want to have a culture.  They don't give a shit. 
[02:32:00]  All they give a shit is about them.  It's about them.  They're not interested.  Maybe you could pick a culture.  Pick a culture.  Absolutely.  When you go to college, if they go an hour a day in college, common sense.  Why don't they teach these fucking geniuses common sense?  Okay?  What's that coming out of my ass?  It's called gas.  Why?  None of your fucking business.  Don't ask questions.  If it's gassing, that means your balls are working.  I don't think you can teach common sense, though.  Huh?  You can't teach common sense.  You've got to just have it.  Common sense is the enemy of the fucking world because we're stupid. 
[02:32:30]  We are so fucking stupid, I can't get over it.  I have no education, and I understand if I've got a pain, you go to the fucking doctor.  Now they look on the computer.  Harry horse shit tells you how to fix the pain.  He says, we'll cost you a dime.  You go to WebMD, it's called.  It's a whole mess.  And people diagnose themselves on the computer.  That shit's scary.  And you either have a cold or cancer.  I don't have none of this shit.  You understand? 
[02:33:00]  Because you eat the food of your culture.  Morning, noon, and night.  Pasta.  A lot of pasta.  I don't know.  Sausage.  Broccoli rabe now is a fucking gourmet dining.  We got it for nothing years ago.  Broccoli rabe?  Now, anywhere you go in a restaurant.  I'm at a Chinese restaurant.  I said, Mosh.  He goes, yes, you want some of our broccoli rabe in a fucking Chinese restaurant?  Because it's the vegetable of the world now.  Broccoli rabe.  We got it for nothing.  They stole it from our culture.  No, I trained around.  It cost me $212.  I took a lady to dinner.  Okay?  And I went home and had a sandwich. 
[02:33:30]  That's the fucking bullshit.  Because you're dining.  See, there's a thing.  When you go out, you're dying.  If you want to eat, stay the fuck home.  And order a pizza.  That's what I get.  208.  That's fucking.  Like a mozzarella sandwich with a pepper.  Then I sat on the bowl and said, this is heaven.  This is heaven.  Pat just likes a good piss, a good shit.  That's right.  That's it.  The simple things in life.  That's what your body says.  When that thing is dumping, man, you're fucking happy.  When you got a cramp, look out. 
[02:34:00]  It eats you from inside.  Yeah, sometimes you get a little blockage.  No blockage.  It's called sickness, pal.  Yeah?  That's right.  You got to push that sickness out.  Because people go, I'm going to go tomorrow to the toilet.  There's no fucking tomorrow.  Your shit's gone.  No, you sick bastard.  I'm staining your shorts.  Let me the fuck out of here.  No, they turn around.  Oh, I'm going to go with my girl first.  You're going to stink up the fucking door.  No brains.  No brains.  No brains.  Common sense.  I wish I had a sense of humor.  What do you eat most?  What do you like to eat when you get up in the morning?  I eat in some of the...  I eat like Fiorello's. 
[02:34:30]  I like that place on 67th Street and Broadway.  I know where it is, but I don't know.  I eat in Pomona on 63rd and 2nd.  Compagnola I eat on 74th.  All Italian joints.  No, no.  Not really.  No?  Not really.  No, no.  They sound very Italian.  I go for fish.  Good, fresh fish.  I go to the Greek diner on the 5th.  You don't have Greek intestines?  What are you doing?  You're telling yourself.  Because the fish comes from Italy.  Oh, okay.  Italian fish. 
[02:35:00]  And Brinzini comes from Israel.  You've got to wear a yarmulke when you eat that fish.  Yes.  Terrific.  That's a great fish.  That's what it is.  See, fish is the ocean of the fucking world.  Oh, okay.  Now we're turning around.  We've got fish in sections.  The fucking shark wants to go on 3rd Avenue.  Why the fuck are we pushing him on 7th Avenue?  I've never heard of a shark even on 3rd.  Why not bring it apart, Doc?  I don't have an education, so I'm trying to educate you because you're the right guy.  What the fuck I'm talking about?  No, no.  He has no education either.  No, no, no.  High school dropout.  Why are we disturbing the environment?  I'm not happy about that, Pat.  I'm not happy about a lot of things. 
[02:35:30]  Just a little.  I loved you when I saw you when you were a kid.  I said, a human being.  All right.  I love him.  A human being.  Most people don't get to see that, Pat.  I love kids.  They turn me on.  It's just wonderful.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Hey, I see a picture in the book.  I want to get back to the book.  You and George Burns from 1966.  Wow.  Nice man.  He looked older in 1966.  I was going to open for Tony Martin three days.  I got into the club three days earlier, and Dorothy Provine dropped out of his show, and 
[02:36:00]  he says, Pat, I need 15 minutes.  Can you come into my show with the letterman on the show, too?  I said, well, I got to ask Tony Martin.  He looked at him.  He said, excuse me.  I said, Mr. Burns, because I'm his con in the next show, I want to show him a courtesy.  He calls up, and then he comes and says, Pat, you're going to lie.  I said, that's fucking class.  You're a gentleman.  You're a gentleman.  No, I was just scared.  I was just scared.  I was just scared.  Pat has great photos.  That's Jerry Fail.  Jerry Vale.  Yeah, Jerry Fail.  Tony Bennett.  I know.  I went to take a pee. 
[02:36:30]  He's behind me.  I give that guy $2.  Jerry goes, he's from the back from the both of us.  Oh, great.  Wow.  Hey, he's laughing back there.  We read this book about people.  You got great photos.  Anthony Quinn.  He wanted me to give anything to be like you, Anthony Quinn.  He says, he's a sculptor.  He's an actor.  He says, but you got balls to go in front of a roast and close it without a piece of paper.  I said, it's not balls.  It's fucking terrified.  I'm shitting in my pants, and people are laughing at that.  You know that you got to perform at that point. 
[02:37:00]  It's a nice picture with De Niro, with your wife and you and De Niro.  De Niro actually looks happy to take a photo.  Wow.  Yeah, look at that.  De Niro looks happy to take a photo with you.  Well, of course.  Robert De Niro comes into the friars.  Listen to this shit.  Oh, yes, sir.  He's in the friars.  I walk in.  I don't know who's there.  He's sitting with Joy Barry.  He's sitting with whatever.  Anyway.  And they said, Mr. Cooper, you know Robert De Niro's here.  I said, so?  I said, please, no pictures, because we're honoring Mickey Freeman.  God bless him.  And I said, well, I'm not going to bother the guys.  But I passed by. 
[02:37:30]  I go, hi, Bobby.  How are you?  I don't mind.  Now I'm closing that show in the friars.  I said, ladies and gentlemen, before I say anything, get your cameras out and take a  fucking picture of Robert De Niro in the fucking corner.  Who the fuck is he to say we can't take a picture?  What the fuck are you famous for, Bobby?  Get up now.  Get up.  And they're clipping the son of a bitch.  He looks at me.  I said, go over there.  Get a fucking autograph.  What the hell are you a star for?  You wait till you start him.  Oh, that's a ball.  That's exactly what we were talking about earlier.  So the show's over. 
[02:38:00]  And I said, so Bobby comes over.  He goes, how the fuck you do that?  It's called talent, Bobby.  Talent.  I said, you crazy bastard.  But you know something?  It's wonderful.  What the fuck?  They got to be afraid.  God, the Robert De Niro.  He's just cackled.  You think there's something wrong with him.  And he's going to feel good.  When I point the name, they all got up with the fucking camera.  There was flashing all over the place.  The fucking electric bill went up.  Take a picture with Bobby De Niro.  That's what we're talking about, right, Jimmy?  I just said, I yelled, get the fuck you're doing here. 
[02:38:30]  Get up, you son of a bitch.  Oh, that's fucking great.  Give a fuck.  I'll give you a fucking shit.  How come you didn't do Rocky?  There's a lot of...  You're fucking nuts.  There's a lot of words in this book.  A lot of words.  There's a lot of words in this book.  Huh?  A lot of words.  Do me a favor.  Wait till the oral version comes out.  Maybe you'll understand it better.  Are you going to do that version?  Are you going to do that version?  Well, we're about 70% finished with that one.  That's a pain in the ass, right?  That's very hard.  Not easy to do. 
[02:39:00]  See the guy behind me, Steve Guerin?  He's directing me through that.  He goes, you didn't say the.  What the fuck is wrong with the?  Gotta say it.  That's in the book.  Because you got assholes by the book and by the oral version.  And if I don't mind, she'll go, I'm cheated.  He didn't put the in there.  They're fucking nuts.  Come on.  Yeah, it's got to be great.  You see, you're in a fucking cocoon here.  That's why.  You're not in America.  No, we're not.  You're in a fucking prison in this fucking place.  Imagine popping that in to listen to the book like that.  Yeah.  And Pat's just yelling at you.  Yeah.  You write my book. 
[02:39:30]  Go fuck yourself.  Do you yell at the people, Pat?  I'm sorry?  Do you yell at the people?  Of course he does.  Do I what?  Do you yell at them?  Do you yell at them?  Do you yell at them?  Do you yell at them?  Do you yell at them?  No, to you, it's yelling.  To me, it's explaining.  And getting the sickness out.  No, I cannot say.  I cannot say, how are you, how's that mean?  In my house from years ago.  Pass the macaroni.  What the fuck is the forks?  What?  I tried to put the fucking bread on.  So now, my wife, God love it, came from a little town called Ashtabula.  She never heard.  She goes, can you pass the macaroni? 
[02:40:00]  I didn't fucking hear you, honey.  What?  Can you pass the macaroni?  Say the fucking macaroni.  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Scared the shit of that poor woman.  44 years with her.  How did you meet her?  I opened for her in a place called the Silver Edge in the Bronx.  You know, and I got that.  Was she a singer?  Oh, could she sing?  And a great looking kid.  And, you know, I was looking to get married again.  I had one fucking problem.  I said, it's enough already.  But she saved my ass 44 years with this woman.  Wow.  And then she leaves the planet. 
[02:40:30]  And I'm like eight years.  And I'm walking around.  And people say, you should have somebody to watch over you.  Fuck you.  I want to die alone.  I was born.  Nobody was there clapping me.  Fuck you.  What happens if the middle of the night, I fucking die.  I got everything prepared.  I got the blanket set.  Make sure.  And I say it in an angle.  When I'm at a fucking angle, if I can't move my ass, it's dead.  I'm fucking dead.  Nobody wants to hear it.  Nobody wants to hear it.  It's a pleasure to get the fuck out of here.  It's a fucking pleasure.  I just paid $2.17 for a fucking coffee. 
[02:41:00]  I could have went to Peru for that kind of fucking money.  What a fucking bunch of gangsters out there.  I come from the nickel cup of coffee, the two cents paper, the nickel subway.  Now it's going to be $2.50 to get no fucking wear.  For a nickel, we're going to Utah, for Christ's sake.  Because nobody wants to go to Utah.  No one.  Nobody gives a shit.  We just said we'd become prisoners of ourselves.  The fucking subways are jammed now, right?  Now we say we're in a hole.  When the fucking subways are empty, everybody was happy.  OTB.  OTB. 
[02:41:30]  Now they're in a fucking hole.  How is OTB in a hole?  They're the only bookies that are losing money.  Because whoever's behind it knows where the bodies are buried.  So they're all scared to say anything.  It's called a fucking rat.  You think there's a skim going on there?  There's a skim going on right now in the studio.  What, are you kidding me?  How the fuck do you think you survived?  And the subway, the MTA, they're losing money.  How do you lose money on full?  They tell the people. 
[02:42:00]  The people don't say, show me.  We say, well, I guess so.  Another dime.  Another 15 cents.  Where do you think that money's going?  Where do you think that money's going?  The money's going to where the people who are running this fucking country want it to go.  Why are we in Afghanistan?  Who the fuck has to go there?  We're having trouble on Tord Avenue.  These fucking bully cocksuckers out there are beating up kids.  What is this shit?  We need a fucking army here.  We've got to infiltrate the infiltration here.  Yeah.  I'm scared at night.  You know what?  I carry a large key in my fucking hand.  I go home at two o'clock after a show.  I see anybody.  I'm going to touch me, you mother. 
[02:42:30]  I'll fucking take your tongue out.  I'm scared of my own fucking shout-out.  I never raise my hand to nobody.  Never.  A key like it's 1940.  You've got a key in your hand.  No, but Pat's a guy, though, that you wouldn't fuck with because he sounds crazy.  Like, when Pat yelled at you, you would think that Pat is going to butcher knife in his mouth.  No one would fuck with Pat.  No one fuck with him.  Some people misinterpret my intentions.  I don't swim, but I jump in the water to help somebody.  That's called fucking common sense.  This is my delivery.  Now they say Lou Black stole my delivery.  He didn't steal my delivery. 
[02:43:00]  He's Lou Black.  Stop busting balls.  Don't compare comics.  I mean, my friend Jimmy, he's Jimmy.  I'm Pat.  I mean, my days are fucking over.  No worries, though.  Lisa Laminelli, another fucking bargain, right?  She writes in her book that she was so happy to be on the Jerry Lewis teledon.  She mentioned everybody on the fucking day has never mentioned me in the fucking book.  I bought her book.  She writes, you are my inspiration.  I'm not fucking up, but your inspiration.  You don't mention me after Jerry Lewis rolls that I close, you sick fuck. 
[02:43:30]  What the fuck is wrong with you?  So I wrote, she wanted my book.  I wrote, it's called Dignity.  You don't have it.  And they said, well, you shouldn't say that.  Fuck them.  How dare you fucking disrespect me?  I break my ass for 50 years.  I'm on a fucking dais.  I close the fucking show.  Everybody's scared shit.  And she don't even mention me.  Then she says, the funniest people on the planet is Howard Stern and Rickles.  I said, this fucking girl's got water on the fucking upper deck.  No fucking question.  I can say, I'm Darren Rickles.  Yes, not Howard Stern's got a personality like a mongoose. 
[02:44:00]  Give me a fucking break.  Shit.  I love when they put, you know, it's because he's Howard Stern and because he's Jesus Christ.  They don't walk on fucking water.  They're going to fucking die like we do.  They get prostate like we do.  Who the fuck are they?  That's why I said, how dare you say, how dare me?  Why can't I say, thanks or not?  You're out of fucking order.  Don't you disrespect me?  They stare at you, but it's never been told.  All of a sudden, he's gone with that fucking booze.  I says, do I tell a butcher how to cut fucking meat?  Don't tell me how to be funny.  Next. 
[02:44:30]  Next.  Then I wind up downtown with Joe Williams.  I got $1,500 with Joe Williams.  I got $1,000 with Sinatra.  I'm sticking with Joe Williams.  He goes, yeah, but he's Frank Sinatra.  I love his music.  Fuck it.  I told my mother and father, stop breaking my fucking balls.  I can't tell Sinatra.  Stop breaking my balls.  So Julie goes, you're not going to work with him no more.  Fuck him.  Let's not grab you.  He says, well, that's a terrible.  Fuck him.  The original bridge burner right here.  And the wise guy was in the dressing room.  Sister Frank, not him. 
[02:45:00]  You can't do it to him.  I don't kiss his ass.  I respect him.  I love you.  I respect you.  Thank you.  You know, I got no jealousies.  I wish you'd make a million a day.  It has nothing to do with my life.  But people are worrying.  See, if I'm worried about your career, they're fucking up mine.  Right.  And I respect you.  You can't respect that.  What does he mean by that?  What about us?  You respect us.  Let me tell you something.  I'm glad you don't call me too often,  because the fucking thing is getting on my nerves.  Because after this, I got to take a nap.  I never had to take a nap until I do the show.  And then after four in the morning,  I get up and I got to take another nap. 
[02:45:30]  We're talking about Paco.  Put the fucking book down.  I talk about greatness.  Fuck the book.  It's going to sell anyway.  It's going to be number one.  Then you're going to beg me to come on here.  And I want your kid on here.  I got a question about your book.  Any mafia stories in the book?  Oh, I hear.  I see a big nod in the back of the room.  Yeah.  Here's the mafia story.  Give me a mafia story.  Cosa Nostra.  Give us a nice sweet bottle.  Mr. Happiness is going to break my balls.  No, I won't break your balls, my friend.  Watch out.  He's got stuff. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Yeah.  And they're going to give me 15 grand.  15 grand for a wedding.  You're doing a wedding?  I know a wedding.  It's nice, buddy.  Nice.  I busted my balls.  I turn around.  The show's over.  The show's over.  He gives me 10,000.  Yeah.  I said, jeez, I think you showed me five.  He goes, well, no, you gave it to the bride.  I don't know the fucking bride.  The best man gave her 1,000.  Why the fuck am I giving it five?  He said, don't be a wise guy.  Just back off.  You gave it to the bride.  He didn't give it to the bride.  The cocksucker put it in his pocket.  Sure.  So I had to shut up.  I said, all right.  And I backed away. 
[02:46:30]  This is what you fuck.  This is your own kind fucking you.  Wow.  Every check I got bounced was from my own people.  Every time I went to a problem, my own people.  And this is what they do.  I'm in Chicago.  You know you're with us.  I'm in Boston.  You know you're with us.  I'm in fucking Rhode Island.  You know you're with us.  Who the fuck am I with?  So I get in trouble in New York.  I call up Boston.  I says, you know, Nick the hook.  Yeah, Nick the hook.  He's bothered me.  Well, he's with us.  We can't do nothing.  Make up your fucking mind.  Who the fuck am I with?  Who the fuck am I with?  Then you get this shit.  This is the shit of the wise guy. 
[02:47:00]  A bonometer.  It means the guy died.  You know, a bonometer died.  Who the fuck is a bonometer?  It's, you know, Nicky, you know, Sal.  Yeah, you remember him.  I don't fuck.  You got to send a check.  The fuck is dead.  Why am I sending him a fucking check?  The fucking guy is dead.  Who's getting the money?  He's sending a dead guy a check.  They take it.  They give you a fuck.  They give you.  Don't they do?  Here's the great thing.  When you're in the restaurant, I got the check.  Now, if I finish fucking eating out a sandwich,  if I'm able to get the check, I have a fucking turkey.  So they said you gave five grand to the bride? 
[02:47:30]  I gave nothing.  That's what he said.  It's in the book.  You gave five to the bride.  What would you do?  If he says, what are you going to do about it?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  You really can't do anything.  Although, you should make sure you tell the bride.  No, no.  The bride was probably in, and they probably went 2,500 a piece.  If you fucking talked to the bride about that,  they would fuck you up.  Yeah, don't talk to the bride about that.  What are you disrespect?  You got to do the right thing, Pat.  That's why we love you.  I'm going fucking broke.  End up with an ice pick in your neck.  I would tell the police.  There you go. 
[02:48:00]  That's why you're a rat.  You're a rat.  And they give the police a thousand.  The mob wouldn't bother me because I'm the biggest rat.  I would just go right to the cops.  I'm a fucking pussy.  I'm a pussy.  No, but you know something?  It's a thing that you grew up with that you're used to seeing and hearing it.  And you turn around and say, what am I going to do?  What's wrong with 10 grand?  So you deposit the fucking thing.  And then, you guys, you know, you're ready.  The word's out on your coupe.  We love you.  Where are you going now?  Someone, I'm going to go.  I got to go to California. 
[02:48:30]  All right.  Here's a number.  Give him a call.  I ain't going to fucking call nobody in California.  Do me a favor.  The guy's one of your biggest fans.  So you go.  You call the guy.  Hello.  Salvador.  Hey, Pat, how are you?  Come on.  Take you to dinner.  Takes me to dinner.  I get the check.  He says, you see what your problem is?  You're a two got it.  That's what's a two got it.  Listen to this shit.  He says, you say, I got it.  Then he says, I got it.  And then you say, I got it.  Then you're a two fucking got it.  This is why I'm going fucking broke.  I'm a two got it.  You only should be a one got it.  That's why. 
[02:49:00]  One got it.  Here's what you do.  First time you go, I got it.  Now, when he says, I got it, don't say nothing.  I said, I got it.  The guy went, did you say something?  I didn't say a fucking one.  Two got it.  I swear to you.  They beat you all fucking day.  Two got it.  I like it.  All right.  Jerry Vale takes the seven people out to dinner.  He gets complimented.  Yeah.  My alter guy, Tony Field, Sergio, Frankie, big mob at the Riviera.  He goes, I got the check.  Now, we know he's getting comped.  He signs it.  Comes over to me.  You give the tip.  280 fucking dollars.  I gave the fucking tip to get a free dinner with this fucking guy. 
[02:49:30]  That's the kind of people, they stay awake, figuring, who can I fuck tomorrow?  And they see my face.  It comes up automatically.  I don't think he liked me, this guy here.  Oh, Danny?  He loved it.  He took a nap.  I think he's shitting.  Don't you have commercials anymore?  You want to take a break?  Pat wants to take a break.  We do have a couple, yeah.  All right, we'll take a break.  Yeah, we'll take a quick break.  I got to pee anyway.  Yeah, what's the plug?  Let me give the book signing, though.  The great Pat Cooper.  Tonight will be at the Borders Books in Columbus Circle.  It's in the Time Warner building. 
[02:50:00]  Pat's just a fucking crazy person live.  Seven o'clock tonight.  Go there, get your book signed.  This was a book that Pat spoke out and then was just transcribed.  So this is all Pat's real words.  Go to Amazon.  Go to Amazon.  Go to Amazon.  You'll save a few dollars.  I mean it.  Go to Amazon.  That's the goddamn computer.  I can't do it.  Well, it's Amazon.  I can't do it.  You can't do Amazon if you don't have a computer.  I can't do it.  I got my son who does it.  Yeah.  Yes.  And that's enough.  He knows how.  I got an accountant who counts my fucking money. 
[02:50:30]  Right.  And I got people that do their job.  I don't do your job.  You just got to shit, piss, and breathe.  What else is there?  What else is there?  It seems like you're a happy guy.  As long as you're pissing, shitting, and breathing, you're all right.  I got a place in Florida.  I got a place in New York.  I'm healthy, thank God.  I got a few dollars.  Where the fuck am I going?  I mean, I come here.  You're nice enough to invite me.  I come here.  I try to be.  I try to.  No, I try to contribute.  I'm not being funny.  Wait, to contribute to me is important.  He got you.  He got you. 
[02:51:00]  You really did.  Go first.  We finally got him.  And he smiled, too.  I topped you.  Hey, not bad.  One out of a thousand.  More with Pat Cooper.  Stay there.  The O.P. and Anthony Show on the Virus Sirius XM.  How lucky can one guy be.  He can't hear this.  Big pop.  Pat Cooper can't hear this. 
[02:51:30]  Like the fella once said.  Ain't that a kick in the head?  He's just entertaining the room.  He ain't got Pat Tranger down.  You give me.  He says that's Coop.  He's vibing you up a fucking wall.  Don't believe it.  That's just Billy.  You went over there.  Let me ask you something, Billy.  If George Byrne said it to you, you would go, oh, that's funny.  If Milton Byrne said it to you, oh, that's fucking funny.  I, a fucking genius, you don't want to fucking know because my culture is the shit.  You have to walk away.  You talked through the entire break, by the way.  Keep it track at home. 
[02:52:00]  Good.  Pat Cooper's here.  His new book is How Dare You Say How Dare Me.  And it's basically one very, very long sentence.  Thank you, Bobby.  You're welcome.  Listen to me.  There's one period in this entire book.  Yes.  What happened?  I want you people to know that I did all the talking on this bad damn thing.  But my friend Rich Richlock did the printing.  And Steve Garren did the directing.  And the three of us are partners.  And I got the best two guys in the world.  Rich Richlock, a wonderful man, and Steve.  And Jack Martling is at the duplex. 
[02:52:30]  Please, you people who want semi-comedy, I would advise you to go to the duplex and say,  why is he here?  He's not only a nice guy, but the jokes, I don't want to say nothing, are being stolen by people who can't talk.  This is it.  But Jackie, I love you.  You're going to have a great crowd tonight, but not in your place in the subway.  Because it's time for people to go home.  God bless you, Jackie.  Jackie, the joke now.  Nice guy.  Where is he?  Only guy, only guy that asked for macaroni at the stage deli. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  That's when I know that guy's off a mountain somewhere.  When is Jackie performing?  I don't even know.  When?  Saturday.  Saturday.  I'm not doing the show to advertise everybody's life.  Yeah, what are you doing that for?  I don't know what you're doing, man.  This is your time.  Why am I only on a half an hour?  It's your time.  Your time.  Where's my lawyers?  What time is it already?  Nobody advertises my Poughkeepsie dates this Friday, Saturday.  Bananas Comedy Club.  Which one are you working?  Bananas and Poughkeepsie.  Can I tell you something?  I'm big hit, damn.  Don't drop my name, I'll get an ovation. 
[02:53:30]  Before you work Poughkeepsie, you've got to make a novena.  Because it's been closed for 42 years.  So when you go on a Zoom, when you go on Saturday or Tuesdays?  Friday, Saturday.  You're going to pack them in.  I'll do good.  If there's a crowd on the outside, they're looking for freebies.  That's great.  Are you driving up yourself?  With me and Kenny will go up, yeah.  You're going with somebody?  Yeah, I bring a friend.  They pick me up, I don't want to say nothing.  They do.  I just want you to get all the benefits that you deserve. 
[02:54:00]  Unbelievable.  No, I want people to be treated the way I'm treated.  You know, when I'm the headline of a show, if I've got a bottle of whiskey, the opening  act gets a bottle of whiskey.  I do.  I stand by that, I say, because I went through that shit.  Yeah.  I work with the big stars, they've got champagne, they've got apples, they've got this.  I've got all guys.  All I've got is flies from his fucking basket.  So I turn around one time and I bought my own whiskey and Jerry goes, how come you got  whiskey?  I say, I fucking bought it.  That's how I got it.  Fucking people are jealous bastards.  Sick fucking guys. 
[02:54:30]  I hear.  That's why I say debt is wonderful.  Get rid of these fucks.  I hear the outtakes from the audio book that you do are hysterical.  What did you say?  What did you hear them?  Because your friend there was talking about that.  You heard them already?  No, he said they're very funny, though.  Well, why don't you buy them, you bastard?  I would love to get access to your outtakes.  Would you really?  Yeah, we want to play your outtakes.  All right, I'll tell you, I'll be here in 2011 this time.  You fucks never put me on in the morning.  This is an afternoon shit.  Nobody listens to this shit.  Why are you trying to make me a nun, though? 
[02:55:00]  You're like the Italians, you know, don't get too fucking cocky.  I'm here 52 fucking years ago.  You know, you could end it tomorrow, so don't think you're fucking smart.  I'm 52 fucking years in a business.  You're already in.  Yeah, you're in, I think, at this point.  And all these young assholes who call themselves comic, who ain't got a fucking flow, they don't  get it.  What they're doing is they're not doing their craft.  All they want to do is talk about shit that don't mean nothing.  You understand?  Like who?  You.  You. 
[02:55:30]  That hurts.  That's wonderful.  You live on my street also, huh?  Yeah, I haven't seen you in the neighborhood lately.  Because I got fucking things to do, Opie.  I go shopping, I go downtown.  I'll give you one better.  The Delicatessen on Mott Street.  The Palos, one of the best dollies in the country.  Ready?  Bought 100 books.  I will sign them December 12th.  Anybody that buys 100 bucks, I'll go in there naked and sign it.  That's what you call balls.  Those are my good Italian friends. 
[02:56:00]  And then they give you free cheese.  What the fuck more do you want?  Free cheese.  This guy's in a cozy, all right?  Anybody that wears a fucking hat means he wants to leave any minute now.  God bless you.  You go with him.  Yeah.  Smart move.  You don't take a lady, do you?  No.  Never take a lady.  No, because then you argue and it fucks up the show.  Never take your lady.  Never.  No, to your show.  You know what I used to tell my wife?  When I was a bricklayer, did you come on the wall?  What the fuck are you doing in my dressing room? 
[02:56:30]  Am I right?  You're right.  You're completely right.  You know what it is?  I don't do the stand-up.  Jimmy does.  So, you know.  Jimmy would know.  This is good therapy for you three guys.  Yeah, why?  Because I have high respect for you.  I love you guys.  And I know I'm not going to be seeing you until at least maybe, hopefully, I'll be alive next year.  You know, and it's not like I got to do this shit.  I don't got to do it.  See, you need me.  I don't fucking need this.  This is the beauty part.  If you never brought me on again, that's a fucking.  I'll go on another show and badmout you.  That's what happens, right? 
[02:57:00]  I'm Mr. Badmout.  I'm not you.  Because you're a fucking.  You're a semi, but watch out.  Thank you.  You're about ready to break out.  Thank you.  I'm telling you, man.  I've been watching you.  Yeah.  I'll shake you on the home box, but it'll be fine.  I did the home box.  I just found out something.  I did home box 1980.  Wow.  They're selling it now in Best Buy, 19 fucking 80.  And there's a big, big carpet behind me when I'm doing home box, and it says, you know,  the name of the club.  The guy would not take the fucking thing down.  I said, you're getting paid for me to do this in home box. 
[02:57:30]  Take that guy out there.  He wouldn't take it down.  So I'm talking, and you're looking at a carpet behind me.  That's the fucking Italians that don't belong in my fucking business.  Ah, shit.  Next case.  What else?  Are you getting money from the DVD sales?  No, I don't want money.  Fuck them.  No.  Give me a sandwich, something.  Something to hold on.  A carpet.  A fucking pair of shoes.  Money don't mean shit.  Because everything is tax, tax, tax, tax.  Oh, yeah.  All right?  All right.  I just moved to Florida.  Why?  Because I couldn't refuse.  This guy sold me a two-bedroom for $35.  I couldn't fucking refuse.  $35. 
[02:58:00]  You know what I mean?  And it cost me $250 to put the pipes in and the fucking windows and everything.  So when they say, boy, you saved money.  I saved nothing.  Then you got to put tile on with carpets before the tile goes on in case you're a tap dancer.  I don't fucking tap dance, but it's a fucking law.  It's a law.  It's a law.  In other words, if I got high heels and a woman downstairs isn't, they tear up the floor  and they put a carpet and then they re-tile it.  That's the shit I got.  And everybody talks there very quiet. 
[02:58:30]  Come on, he knows everything.  What?  Come on, he knows everything.  Listen, why don't you fucking die and stop wasting space in this fucking world?  I can't fucking hear you.  That's not a mushroom in my ear.  It's a fucking hearing aid.  What are you yelling for?  Don't whistle in the elevator.  It's bad luck.  Fuck you.  That's it.  Is it bad luck to whistle in an elevator?  I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a shit.  Everything's bad luck.  Don't do this.  Read my, I got my, I'm a horoscope.  Fuck your horoscope.  I love how guy goes, I got a horoscope, says I'm going to hit something. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, you're going to hit a fucking truck.  That's what you hit.  Why are you looking for free advice?  There's no free advice.  There's a spirit out there.  And if you got a spirit in your soul, that's where you are.  When you're born a dog, you can't die a cat.  Remember those fucking words.  When a guy says, you know, pot, I change.  You're full of shit.  You're a fucking dog and you're trying to die a cat.  You're a prick.  That's it.  Prick, prick, prick, prick, prick.  That's it.  Can't change.  They don't understand.  Yeah.  You understand?  Yeah, I understand. 
[02:59:30]  They don't understand.  Life lessons.  We're just a pack of ants here.  That's all.  That's it.  What are you doing whispering to me on the radio?  What are you doing, Pat?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  He's getting too comfortable, Pat.  He's whispering to me on the radio.  He's getting too comfortable.  What?  What did he do?  He kissed you on the radio?  He's whispering to me.  He's whispering sweet nothings.  He's long, yeah.  That's what he said.  Nothing.  What was he whispering, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I don't want to listen.  What do you want to fucking do?  I'm listening to Pat.  I don't want to listen.  We're enjoying Pat Cooper. 
[03:00:00]  What does the man want?  The mustache.  He's whispering.  He's going, Jim.  Jim.  Sir, what were you saying?  Doing a movie deal.  Doing a movie?  Doing a movie, Pat.  What movie?  Exactly.  Pat doesn't even know.  I'm going to be on Slides next Thursday.  That's what I'm going to be.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to be.  Is that what you were telling me to me?  I'm looking at this fucking thing.  Sales, I'll be happy.  And I tell you right now, it's a great, great, great book.  And I swear to God, on my grandkids who I love daily, you're going to take a trip on 
[03:00:30]  this fucking book and say, Pat nailed it.  It's comedic.  It's pathos.  It's everything.  It's just nice.  I'd like this to be a movie, but you know, you can't play me because you don't have that  Italian fucking thing.  Who would you like to play a young Pat Cooper?  A young Pat Cooper?  He's not born yet.  No?  He's not born yet?  No, he's not born yet.  He's not born yet.  There's got to be an actor that can play you in a movie.  He's in the belly trying to get out two months early.  That's going to be a movie that's coming out in a long time then, because he's got 18 years.  Matt, let's make a great fucking movie, because it says something. 
[03:01:00]  What's the one word?  Dignity.  And if you look at television every day and radio, you'll hear radio.  What are they talking about?  Don't let bullies bullshit you.  You have a dignity.  You have a fucking character.  Don't fucking threaten me, you asshole, because you're not going to win.  Let me see what you're going to do.  You better fucking kill me, pal, because if you don't kill me, I'm going to get you,  and I'm not a fucking fighter.  Fuck you.  That's what it is.  That's what it is.  People call you a bully, though.  Huh?  People have called you a bully through your career. 
[03:01:30]  I wish I all were bullies like me.  I give away.  I got no fucking money.  A guy cries to me, mister, can you give me a couple of dollars?  I want to eat.  I said, come here, take him to a restaurant.  Fuck you, and he walks.  He wants maybe a drink.  No, that's okay.  If he said to me, I want a drink, I said, come on, I'll buy a Remy Martin.  They're out of Dean Martin.  A Remy Martin.  A Remy Martin.  Wow.  I drink that once in a while, and my balls don't move.  Yeah, I think a little Remy Martin.  Remy Martin, your balls don't move.  Everything in a move.  It's wonderful.  It's good when you got a cold. 
[03:02:00]  I swear to you, it's great.  It makes you go to sleep nicely.  Then when you wake up, you don't know who the fuck you are for about a half an hour.  But it's great.  It's a great drink once in a while when I got a cold.  I love it.  It's a good, whoever out there, send me a case.  Have you been threatened before?  You've been threatened in the years you've been doing it, right?  I was threatened.  Jesus Christ.  It's got it in the book.  I was threatened.  They're going to fucking beat the shit.  They're going to fucking kill me.  A guy turned around and signed my name on my check.  Oh, shit. 
[03:02:30]  And he goes to the wise guys.  And I get a call.  And I happen to know that guy as he called.  And we met in a restaurant.  And my, oh, good God.  And we're all sitting there.  The restaurant's empty.  Only us six people.  When he signed your check, I'm not sure.  What do you mean?  You had a check that was made out to you?  I was mailed to me.  And the guy got it first.  He signed it.  And it was $10,000.  He signed it.  Now, get this.  I turn around. 
[03:03:00]  I'm there with my wife.  There's six, seven of us.  And in comes this guy who signed my check with his wife.  The wise guy turns around, gets up, and smacks this guy in the fucking face.  And punches him in the fucking nose.  Breaks his nose.  And the blood comes down on my shirt and on my wife's dress.  He's your motherfucker.  You do this to Al Paisan.  You fucking sign your name on his fucker.  I'll fucking bury you.  I'm going, forget about it.  It's not even fucking worth it.  Please don't do that.  I'm scared.  I'm scared. 
[03:03:30]  All right?  This is the coup de grace.  He goes, I'll tell you, fucker.  I'll fucking get.  He says, I'll pay you, Pat.  I said, okay.  So my lawyer says, get the 10 first.  And then I said, no, I trust him.  Wrong.  I said, all right.  I didn't press charges.  Never got the fucking 10.  Never got the fucking 10.  And the cocksucker, right?  They found him in a fucking trunk.  Oh, shit.  They were my 10.  No, I'm serious.  That's a true story.  I mean, when you see a guy hit a guy, if there's women, their blood's on your fuck. 
[03:04:00]  My wife comes from a small town.  She goes, what happened to us?  She says, we got to get the fuck out of here.  We got to get the fuck out of here.  Because, you know, we're not those tough.  We're not tough guys.  I said, I'm not a tough guy.  But they found him.  I mean, the guys just step outside.  I go, why do you want to hit?  You're a sick fuck.  Why do you want to hit me?  If I make you laugh before you throw the first punch, you're going to make me laugh?  Yeah.  I'm going to do James Cagney for you.  You're a dirty rat.  You're nothing or good.  You know, just upset them.  Get that fucking, you know, say, she's on my tempo.  It's all fucked up.  This guy wants to do Cagney when I want to kick this shit out of him. 
[03:04:30]  That's my defense.  Holy shit.  I'm not a tough guy.  Tough guys, you know where they are?  And here's the fucking coup de grace.  They're all fucking rats.  They became cocksuckers, fucking rat on each other, and they're tough guys.  I'm a tough guy because I wouldn't rat on nobody.  Mind my fucking business.  All about my life.  These guys are in jail, ratting on each other, and they call themselves tough.  They're the fucking lowest bullies in the world.  Why?  And who do they make suffer?  Oh, here's the funny thing.  This is the coup de grace. 
[03:05:00]  Many years ago, a woman, an Italian woman, goes to the judge.  Your Honor, please don't let your cue to my son.  He's a good boy.  And the judge goes, he killed nine fucking people, lady.  When the fuck was he a good boy?  Are you fucking nuts?  But he didn't mean he has eye trouble.  He ain't got fucking eye trouble.  He whacked out nine people.  All right?  But please, with your permission, can I bring him a macaroni?  Fuck the macaroni!  Why didn't this wise guy say, I miss my mother's macaroni? 
[03:05:30]  Why didn't you say that when you were fucking out of jail, you sick fuck?  What do you want before you die?  My mother's macaroni.  She's dead.  I don't give a fuck.  Take her off.  You understand?  What is fucking wrong with tough guys?  I want mama's macaroni.  You killed 35 fucking people.  What kind of fucking people want to kill people?  It's fucking sick, man.  In that business.  That's not a business.  Look at this guy.  He cleaned it up.  It's a business now.  Now you're going to pay dues. 
[03:06:00]  It's a business.  You know, family business.  I tell you, I backed away.  I never asked for favors.  I went about my business.  I don't want to be bothered.  So if they say something to me, Pat, can you show up and say a few words?  I say here.  And there's another thing that kills me.  Patty, yeah, you know, it's Tommy.  Hey, Tommy, guess who died?  Who died?  He says, you know, the WAP.  The WAP died?  Yeah.  Who's the fucking WAP?  What do you want to go send that little money for the woman?  Then I find out the mother's dead. 
[03:06:30]  So I send that check a couple hundred dollars, all right?  Now, my wife died.  Never heard from them.  Motherfuckers never called and said my condolences.  You know, not a fucking word.  Not a word.  They said we're having a memorial for Chuck to Charlie.  Chuck to Charlie.  What's a memorial?  Should we say a few words?  He's fucking dead.  He can't fucking hear me.  But, you know, when you go to the fucking church, you know,  and you got to get up and say, and I'll always love Chuck was a good guy.  He wasn't a fucking good guy.  Then they found out he had homosexual turrets and things there. 
[03:07:00]  So what did they do?  They said, forget the fucking mention of him.  He's a fucking fag.  So there you go.  There you go.  I mean, how the fuck do you live a life like this?  Christ almighty.  But that's what it is.  But my people, 99 and three quarters of my people are the fucking,  they're the best.  They're the best.  I mean, we never had prejudice.  Never years ago.  We got along with each other.  Every Friday, I swear, we had Chinese people over the house for dinner.  Every Friday. 
[03:07:30]  No way.  And to make me feel at home, my mother put a message in the ravioli.  You got the wrong insides for the Chinese, though.  That's your story.  What's up with the other Chinese?  We got along years ago.  I thought you weren't supposed to eat the Chinese.  Not me.  You don't have Chinese interference.  I just said to you, my mother put a message in the ravioli.  You didn't call fucking Chinese, you sick fucker.  I was confused.  Never heard of a fortune ravioli.  They're going to kill you.  The Jamesons are my closest friends.  I love them.  You tell them.  Is Harley going to be there?  Uh, yes.  I just said, Pat said he loved you.  Yeah, you're just having a conversation with Jimmy. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, all right.  What was he talking about?  Don't forget, Jack Martin, we got the duplex Saturday.  All right.  I just heard he got canceled.  No, I didn't.  I'm only kidding.  I'm only kidding.  This book looks like it's going to be a hit.  Yeah, Pat Cooper.  How dare you say, how dare me?  Thanks, guys.  I love you.  That's at Barnes & Noble.  Barnesandnoble.com.  Sign us tonight, by the way.  Amazon.  Go to Amazon.  You're on Amazon and signing Borders Books, 10 Columbus Circle, tonight, 7 p.m. 
[03:08:30]  That's the Time Warner building.  Yes.  And it's in that little mall in there, and it's a great place for signing because all  these, you don't have to stand outdoors at all.  Just stand at Columbus Circle.  When you hear Pat, follow his yelling, and you'll find the signing somewhere.  I'm on there now.  I don't take any chances.  I'll go on the corner.  Oh, God, this is so funny.  I like to come here.  It's like therapy.  You know, I...  They were going to cancel you, but I did the show.  You're good for another three days.  Thanks. 
[03:09:00]  We have you to blame.  Thanks.  Pat would be very entertaining to see you at a book signing.  Oh, yeah.  Pat, because you know you're going to fuck with everybody.  Oh, you know it.  It's going to be a very entertaining event.  How does he get his energy, Jimmy?  I don't know.  He's just one of those guys that's just born with that energy.  You've always had this energy, Pat.  Well, years ago, they said you was a retard.  My father goes, if something's wrong, he'd speak out of turn.  But if you were Italian and you sang off key, another Caruso.  But if you were funny, because Italians were not known to be funny. 
[03:09:30]  They thought you made a fool of yourself when you said something at the table.  But if you were Jewish, you said something funny.  Another Milton Boyle.  That's the difference of culture, see, when you study that.  Because when I grow up and watch comics, all Jewish guys were great.  Shecky Green, I mean, Milton Byles were great.  All of them, Jack Benny's, they were all Jewish.  I mean, it's in their DNA.  They dynamite with the comedic flow.  I don't see much flow today with some of the comics.  They don't have a flow, a rhythm.  See, we become like jazz guys, jazz comics. 
[03:10:00]  You know, he's got it, I think.  He's got it.  No doctor can cure it either.  You know what I'm saying?  Hey, your father, there's a picture of Pat's dad.  It's cool, because he talks about his father.  And did he ever see you perform, or did he die before you performed, or did he saw you?  He says, I don't know what he does.  He says, keep your union card.  Oh, really?  Because they never saw a check, $25,000 for one night.  I didn't make that in a year when I was laying bricks.  Right.  And he left there, he goes, I don't want to get too killed.  He did a lot of neck movement, my father. 
[03:10:30]  We never served him soup.  Never.  He used to talk that way.  If the wind was blowing on his hat, the hat never fell off, because he had a certain  rhythm with his head.  Everybody's losing a fucking umbrella.  Everybody's losing their shoes.  He's going, I go, Dad, what's the matter of your hat on for?  Because I have a rhythm.  It's a bloody Italian rhythm.  And fucking, one time he missed his mountain stab at the waitress.  And we had a set up.  It took me a second.  He missed his mountain stab at the waitress.  Yeah, because he always moves his head. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, here he comes again.  Thank you.  Look at him hovering like impending.  He's like a scent.  You should grab his fucking shirt collar and smash a bottle into his face like in Goodfellas.  He just leaned in and put the book upside down in front of me.  Yeah.  I want you to see the quotes.  I want you to see the quotes.  What the fuck is he doing?  I don't know.  Why no picture with Frank Sinatra in the book?  I want him to see the quotes.  Yeah, I want him to see the quotes.  Hey, what do you want? 
[03:11:30]  Nothing.  Here's a great quote.  That guy's annoying.  Jim Norton.  There's your quote.  Oh, mother of God.  Where's the Frank Sinatra picture?  Do you have a Sinatra picture or no?  No Sinatra picture?  Picture with Sinatra?  No.  Had you ever gotten one?  I wouldn't take a picture because after what I told him, that was the end of me.  That was the end of him, yeah.  No, but you know something?  Every time he saw me, he hugged me.  How are you doing, Pat?  I said, I'm fine, Frank.  And a wise guy who was very close to Frank said, Frank, you can't do that to this guy.  This guy, he's just that kind of guy. 
[03:12:00]  He said, don't tell him how to be funny.  I don't tell you to sing, Frank.  Don't tell him how to be funny.  You don't tell a butch how to cut the fucking veal cutlets.  And they looked at me because no one's ever said that.  I mean, Pat Henry, God love him, was with him 14, 15 years.  And Tom Dreeson, another wonderful guy.  But you know something?  They idolize him so much that they forgot who they are.  They didn't promote their comedy.  They didn't promote how great they are.  They say, I'm with Frank.  I'm with Frank.  I'm with Frank.  I'm with Frank.  I'm with Frank.  What the fuck is that?  How dare you?  How fucking dare you not be an individual? 
[03:12:30]  You can respect a guy and say, I love that guy.  He's wonderful.  How are you?  I never took a picture.  I never went to his dressing room.  I never hung out with him.  I do.  I finished the job.  I went home.  They go, you don't you hang out with Frank?  I don't hang out with my wife and I'm married to her.  She's got her own fucking room.  Why?  Because she wants to get laid in the dark.  I can't see the fucking dark.  I mean, give me a fucking break.  How hard were those gigs opening for Sinatra?  Were they easy or hard gigs?  Ah, I'm shitting in my pants with nerves.  I got Count Basie who did a half hour before him with that fucking band. 
[03:13:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, I know, come up and I go out and I'm talking for five minutes  and they're staring at me and Phil Harris.  I don't know if you remember Phil Harris.  He goes, bring the man on.  And I said, what's the matter, Phil?  You can't get a girl?  Broke it up.  And Alice Faye, who was his wife, I went, you'll never know just how much I love you.  That was a famous song.  I said, what a pair of balls.  I'm a young kid, scared shit, bring on the man. 
[03:13:30]  We went backstage, I said, I mean, some of you prick.  How the fuck are you trying to upset me?  Who's your guy?  You're a prick.  Phil Harris, you're a fucking prick.  I said, I'm working with Sinatra.  I'm shitting in my pants.  And then Frank says, take this out.  I know the fuck am I here?  Why the fuck am I here?  And they go, this guy's fucking nuts.  No, I'm not nuts.  You ain't going to do that to me.  I give a fuck who you are.  And they backed away.  And every night I worked, nobody said a fucking law. 
[03:14:00]  I swear to God.  But you know something?  It was the toughest 58 shows I ever did.  Yeah.  Because I felt I wasn't wanted.  And I asked, I said to Frank, I'll leave tomorrow.  But please, don't tell me how the fuck you're taking out a piece of my fucking, the only  thing I'm getting a laugh, you want to take out my the and my about and who?  How the fuck could you do that?  He didn't, I swear to you, he didn't know.  He's looking at me and Jilly was behind me.  And my friend Louie said, Frank, not this guy.  This guy ain't going to take that. 
[03:14:30]  You can't do that to this guy.  That's unfair.  They're waiting for you.  And he's, and that 58 fucking shows when that was over, I went downtown with Joe and  everybody made fun of Joe Williams.  Yeah.  Fuck.  You went downtown at the Sinatra.  You fucking dumb cocksucker.  Few years later, Steve.  You need to go downtown.  Sinatra goes downtown.  Oh, now yours are all cocksuckers.  When I went downtown, I was a prick, a piece of shit.  Yours are all fucking losers.  Frank went downtown and Frank went to fucking hell.  You said, oh, follow him. 
[03:15:00]  I ain't follow him.  Fuck all he is.  Victor Moon, you know, another guy.  And everybody went with Frank.  Went with fucking Frank.  Where's Victor Moon now?  He's selling fucking umbrellas on the fucking beach of Miami.  Fuck all he is.  Cocksuckers.  I stand up to people and you call me a prick.  Fuck you.  What did Sinatra say to you?  What did he say to you?  Not to do certain things?  Did he say you don't?  He took out a thing about the saints.  I said, I was only getting less on that fucking little story.  The saints.  My mother turned the saints upside down.  I said, Julia, why didn't Frank tell me that? 
[03:15:30]  And I knocked on the door and I start fucking screaming.  I said, then I had pricks coming around.  Get a fucking guy.  Bring on the guy.  Fucking Phil Harris.  Drunken cocksucker that he was.  Fucking drunk.  Who are you calling?  You're a prick.  Okay?  You're a prick, prick, prick.  And now this phrase standing there says, Phil, leave it alone, Phil.  Yeah, Phil, fuck.  I figure I'm going to get fired.  And then you think, I don't let things go.  Frank's mother said, that's your friend.  This is 40, 50 years ago.  That's your friend.  Like it happened yesterday. 
[03:16:00]  Not those gavons that you hang out with.  Gavons.  That's what she said.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  A couple of weeks later when she heard the story, she says,  Bajka, God bless you.  You got a dignity.  That's what you got.  I said, well, I'm not trying to do anything wrong.  You did right.  And my son should know better to tell you what to do with the tools.  You got the tools.  And he kept you on, or that was the end of it?  No, but it wasn't even keeping me on.  It was so fucking bad.  I went on. 
[03:16:30]  I went on my 20 minutes.  I wanted to get the fuck out of there.  It was poison to me.  But I finished the engagement, and three days later, down the fuck with Joe Williams.  And I worked with the biggest stars.  Jimmy, the biggest stars.  Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King.  Where the fuck you got?  They were wonderful to me.  How are you, Pag?  Welcome to the show.  Well, thank you.  I want to fucking cry.  And these cocksuckers turning around, take this out, take that out.  How fucking dare you?  Tell the fucking plumber to fuck his pipes.  How dare you say, how dare me? 
[03:17:00]  That's why I got the book like that.  And remember, the next book, I'm going to tell you what's the next book.  What's the next book?  You born a dog, you can't die a cat.  Remember that.  Fuck, Pat, you rule.  I love the Pat Cooper.  And, in my comedic world, they don't respect me.  Comedians do?  No, I'm bringing out a point.  Never did the comedy festival.  Why?  What the fuck did I do wrong?  Why?  When they had it up in Canada, when they had it here, nobody would pick up the one and say, 
[03:17:30]  get Pat Cooper.  You know why?  Because they know I'm going to fucking destroy them.  One way or the other.  If I bomb, I'm going to be fucking great.  Because nobody bombs like me.  I'm the best bomber in the fucking world.  I want the bombs call.  Everybody was fucking breaking my balls.  How dare you fucking say that to me?  Who the fuck are you?  I told my father.  I said, he goes, you know, you eat it.  It's six o'clock.  It's one minute after.  Open the fucking door.  I'll kick it down.  I couldn't kick my fucking ass down.  He goes, I'm going to be honest, six o'clock will you eat? 
[03:18:00]  All right, stop breaking my fucking balls.  Then I go sitting down there and the macaroni's missing.  He goes, you'll see you late.  Today that's called fucking abuse.  Years ago it was called raising your children.  That's the fucking difference.  Years ago there was dignity, character.  And if you don't like it, I said, why is the dipper always facing you?  He said, get him married and get your own fucking dipper.  That's what my old man told me.  He said.  I said, where's the dessert?  Put your hands underneath the pasta. 
[03:18:30]  If you find ice cream, that's the fucking dessert.  But your hand is going to get wet.  But he was a saint.  Who?  Your father.  A saint.  You've told us he was a saint in the bathroom.  He says a lot of things that I put in his mouth.  If he said that, he would be at the Radio City Music Hall getting big money.  No saying again.  You're going to pray that next.  I don't know.  That's too many seats.  Make sure I'm in there.  You know, Pat, I would love to sit here all day and chat with you.  Goodbye.  But I'm fucking done.  Fuck you. 
[03:19:00]  Goodbye.  I don't need this shit.  Fuck you.  Goodbye.  That should be your book.  I hope your fucking bird walks with a limp.  That's going to be his right there on the headstone.  Fuck you.  Goodbye.  Thanks for having me.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  You are the best.  Thank you.  Goodbye, everybody.  Goodbye, fucking world.  We're closing out.  Friday morning, 10 o'clock.  Borgata tickets on sale.  Myself, Jim Brewer, David Tell, Bill Burr for January 16th, Sunday night before Martin Luther 
[03:19:30]  King's birthday.  Very good.  And Pat Cooper's book, obviously.  And funny quotes.  Yeah, no, I know.  We know, we know a guy with weird moustache.  What is that?  Maury.  Maury's wigs.  Thank you, Pat.  It's Maury from Maury's wigs.  And he should have the same fate, an ice pick to the back of the head.  Can you sign my book?  Yeah, that's fine.  That's okay.  I'll get one, too.  I'll take this, though.  This is fine.  No, we'll get you a hardcover.  But you know what?  Keep these because...  Oh, shut up.  Oh, Jesus.  Just enough already. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  Thank you, Pat.  That's good.  Thank you.  What happened?  Oh, many times.  Many times.  122 is the unsolved murder.  I want my money.  I want my money.  It was my caper.  It was my caper.  I want my money.  The real name is on this.  Dude, there's a story in here about an unsolved murder.  Really?  Pat, did he kill somebody?  Did he kill somebody?  Did you kill somebody?  Did you kill somebody?  What?  I don't know.  He's telling me about an unsolved murder in the book or something. 
[03:20:30]  I killed somebody?  That's what he just told me?  I killed him here today.  Did you say I killed somebody?  No, I said there's an unsolved murder in the book.  Hey, you motherfucker.  I told him there's the Frankie Flowers story.  Oh, I never felt that funny.  I don't know.  I don't want to tell him, but that's the one they were talking about.  Yeah.  I killed that guy in the trunk.  It's a good story.  True story, yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  See, you forgot you had a high one.  Take care.  Kiss the baby, bubby.  I will, man.  We'll see you in the neighborhood, Pat Cooper.  I used to be a children.  Yeah.  Anthony.  It's been a pleasure.  Pat, thank you, sir.  You take care, huh? 
[03:21:00]  They're out of here.  God bless.  Pat's the greatest.  I don't know how he goes through life that way.  I'm exhausted.  I've seen him on the street.  It's not an act.  I'm exhausted.  He's like that, just walking around.  Holy shit.  Now we're supposed to sit in a fucking meeting?  I guess.  Pat made more sense than that meeting is going to.  I did speak to Bladder.  Yeah.  And he explained certain things.  I don't care.  And I feel a little bad.  Do you?  I do. 
[03:21:30]  I got to.  Just a little.  A little bit.  Did they brainwash you?  Let's cancel the meeting.  Yeah, let's do that.  I think everyone listening to you on the radio should know.  What you're hearing is just nonsense.  What you're hearing is just nonsense.  What you're hearing is just nonsense.  What you're hearing is just nonsense.  What you're hearing is just nonsense.
