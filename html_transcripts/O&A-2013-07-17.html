<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Opie and Jim Norton discussing the summer heat and their childhoods without air conditioning, reminiscing about uncomfortable nights.  They then recounted their recent illnesses and recapped the previous day's show, which featured Jeff Bridges as a guest, praising his easygoing nature and book signing.  A lengthy anecdote, originally from a guest named Denny, about a disappointing drive-in movie experience due to the family's frugality, followed.  This transitioned into a discussion of Kirk Cameron's religious views and perceived career decline, touching upon his wife, Chelsea Noble (formerly Mueller), a college acquaintance of one of the hosts, and a Seinfeld trivia tangent referencing Noble's character.  The hosts debated the merits of 90s bands like Creed and Nickelback, prompting a caller to suggest alternative Christian rock bands (Eden's Curse and White Cross), leading to a discussion about the arrest of an As I Lay Dying singer for allegedly plotting to kill his wife.

The show then heavily featured a discussion of the TWA Flight 800 documentary, with the director and an investigator as guests. They detailed inconsistencies in the official investigation, including dismissed eyewitness accounts of a streak of light before the explosion, the involvement of the FBI and CIA, allegations of evidence tampering, shifting explanations regarding explosive residue, and the disappearance of a video showing a missile over Long Island days before the crash.  The filmmakers discussed encountering reluctance from experts. A Coast Guard officer called in to corroborate eyewitness reports.  The conversation shifted briefly to the MLB All-Star game, including the controversy surrounding Mariano Rivera and a fan running onto the field ("City Tweet Jerk"), along with a humorous segment with frequent caller Bobo. The show concluded this portion with a discussion of a new Pearl Jam song.

A segment followed focusing on former President George W. Bush's brightly colored socks, with the hosts and possibly producer Sydney engaging in crude jokes about genitalia and bodily functions while analyzing a photo of Bush in a wheelchair showcasing his socks.  Bob Saget then joined the show, discussing his career, including *Full House*, comedy central roasts, experiences with Jeff Bridges and Clint Eastwood, his recent breakup, his upcoming book detailing potentially inappropriate events, and anecdotes about Johnny Carson.  He promoted his new stand-up special and tour dates.

The show continued with a heavily graphic discussion about defecation, featuring anecdotes from the hosts and a guest, Jimmy, with Bob Saget calling in again to contribute to the discussion and promote his special. This transitioned to a discussion of Sam Roberts' YouTube channel and listener-submitted animations.  Listener calls followed, touching upon TWA Flight 800 conspiracy theories, the Rolling Stone cover featuring the Boston Marathon bomber, intern experiences, and the hosts' and guests' dating and relationship experiences.

The final segment centered on a discussion about a 21-year-old male's low number of sexual partners (four), with the hosts and callers debating quantity versus quality, using crude and sexually explicit language.  They discussed the perceived increase in attractiveness with the presence of other women, and suggested that college-aged women actively seek regrettable experiences, advising listeners to "be the mistake."  A caller, Patrick, offered a contrasting perspective.  The segment heavily featured call-in opinions, with one host, likely Troy, exhibiting an extreme approach to dating.  The show concluded by offering advice to an intern on improving his dating life, referencing past stunts like "Box of Cocks," and promoting upcoming podcast episodes featuring "Stalker Patty," Patrice O'Neill, and Bill Burr.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Nice to meet you.  How did I see it?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  It's not a fight.  That's it.  Just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sitting around.  Let's do it.  It's going down.  Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, we're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Just remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Not enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes!  Good morning, everybody!  There we go.  Heat wave!  How hot is it going to be today?  Nineties.  Nineties.  Nineties.  I had to do a quick ride back and forth to Philly.  Actually, a ride down and then take a train back.  And I'm on the New Jersey Turnpike, and I see it hit a hundred.  Oh, yeah.  The temperature hits a hundred.  And you're on a hot highway.  I think I'll put that air conditioning. 
[00:02:00]  I guess.  Yeah.  I mean, my AC's alright, I guess.  I don't think it can keep up when it's a hundred, though, and you're on a highway.  A little blasting that shit.  You like blasting the AC?  Oh, yeah.  Sometimes my hand gets, like the vent is blowing right out of my hand on the steering wheel.  It's cold?  It's cold.  I love freezing cold when it's hot out.  I'm a fresh air guy.  Yeah.  Fresh air over AC, yeah.  Oh, my God, but it's too hot.  No, no, not when I'm riding, or driving, whatever. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  In my house, I'd rather fucking open the windows than do the AC.  Because we weren't brought up with AC.  Were you brought up with AC?  Yeah, sometimes.  Really?  Depends on what year it was, as to what house we lived in, as to what job my dad had, you  know?  Yeah.  I think I told a story.  We had two fans.  Oh, God.  In our house.  Sounds like this show.  I know.  I can't do Twitter voice today, it hurts too much. 
[00:03:00]  Still dealing with whatever the fuck we have.  I know what this is.  What did we make out, and we don't know it?  Well, with apparently some more people, too.  Because everyone's sick, right?  Everyone seems to have this.  It's like a dry, just annoying cough with me.  Yeah.  That's what's left for me, but...  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  But anyway, we had two fans in our house.  Big fucking fans.  The square ones?  Square, huge ones.  Yeah.  We had a couple of those growing up, yeah.  No AC whatsoever in this huge house out there in Long Island with six bedrooms and seven 
[00:03:30]  to nine siblings, depending on what year it was, who we were bringing in and making believe  we're now fucking family members.  I told a few of those stories yesterday.  They were nice.  And the two fans, one, mommy and daddy got a fan in their room constantly.  Mm-hmm.  They had ownership of the one, and then the other one, we got to share.  Yeah.  But there was like six, there was five other rooms. 
[00:04:00]  So how do you share?  So you get maybe a night where you get the fan blowing on you.  Wow.  That sucks.  That sucks.  I remember so many nights in the summer living in my house growing up.  It's like Thunderdome.  Where you would be so fucking hot, your bed would be drenched.  Mm-hmm.  The sheets would be soaked.  It was that hot.  With no relief.  No.  You don't open up the windows to just, and that would just bring more hot air into the  house, I guess.  Why did you just buy more fans? 
[00:04:30]  Oh, that sounds logical, Jimmy.  Why didn't they stop at the Rocky Point fucking the drive-in movie theater?  Same shit.  I don't know why.  Did you ever ask for another fan?  Yes.  How expensive are fans?  I don't think they were very expensive.  They weren't, right?  Yeah.  I do remember those nights where it was just, you'd just hear the fan, woo, and just still  be so fucking hot.  My dad's theory was great.  It was like, let's take the fan, we'll put it in the window, blowing out, and that way 
[00:05:00]  it'll take the hot air out of the room.  It's like, yeah, but it's just sucking more hot air in.  I'd rather have the fan actually blowing air on me.  Yeah, what air is going to be replaced?  Same hot air.  I mean, if you're removing the hot air, what replaces that?  I'd rather have the air blowing over me and feel like moving air go over you.  Moving air kind of feels better.  Right.  That feels better.  Yeah.  You had AC growing up, Jimmy Norton?  Yeah, but we didn't, there was rules for using it. 
[00:05:30]  My mother was fucking, my mother controlled that.  With an iron thermostat finger.  It was, I don't know, it had to be a certain temperature, we could never use it at night.  She would always, the Norton.  That's when you want it.  I know, but the Nortons didn't have AC at night because of, only during the day, and  I remember I would.  Well, you want it at night when you're sleeping.  Please, I know, I've had this discussion many times.  Okay, because you could jump in a pool during the day, who cares?  I would get up sometimes, it would just be fucking sweltering, and I would, I can remember 
[00:06:00]  the little box, and the little hanging thing under that you move left and right, like the  bottom of a clock.  Yes.  And I would just move it like to the left, like into this, and then it would, the whole  air would go click, click on, and I would just be like, please don't let her wake up.  But then I'd be in bed, and 15 minutes later, I'd hear like, I'd hear like footsteps, her  bedroom door opening, and I would hear the, and you'd hear, shutting down, the Nortons 
[00:06:30]  didn't have air conditioning on at night.  The Nortons like daytime cooling, but not night.  So, little Jimmy Norton would move it a smidge.  Just to try to get some air on.  Just a smidge at night.  Yeah, just a smidge.  Just to get a little fucking cold air.  I hated fucking not having air conditioner at night.  What the fuck, why have it?  So many people have similar stories where, you know, the house was chintzy on their AC.  Oh my God, was my mother a skinflip with the AC. 
[00:07:00]  Just fucking turn it on, you have it.  It's a hot day.  Well, because I never really had it, I'd rather have fresh air, unless it's a scorcher like  today.  But my wife, she grew up with the AC, and her, you know, her father's an AC man.  So, they always had the best AC going.  So, that's a constant fucking tug of war with me and her.  I'd always take the air conditioner.  No, I'd rather have the windows open.  Nice, fresh air coming in.  Even at our beach house that we're lucky to have this summer. 
[00:07:30]  I want to just open all the windows and hear the fucking waves and get a little breeze off  the ocean.  The fucking house is locked down so we can crank the AC.  If you got a, if it's in the shade, you know, if the house is like in the shadows, in the  shade or something, and it's cooler by the water and you open the windows, I could see  that.  Yeah.  If you're just in the middle of your neighborhood and it's blazing fucking hot out, I'll crank  that.  Oh no, I get that.  And I'll open a fucking slider in back. 
[00:08:00]  You get the combo of the nice outside air.  Right.  And then it gets cooled off by the AC.  Yeah.  This is our heat wave break.  Do you know what I hate when a cabbie does this?  When you're in a cab and they put the air blasting, and I like to open the window too  for a little bit, and then they turn the air off.  It's like, why do you care what I'm doing with, like, it doesn't change anything.  Right, right.  And he thinks it's sucking up his gas.  It's not saving anything.  Even if it is sucking up his gas, whether the window is open or not, it's using the same 
[00:08:30]  amount of gas.  If I'm fucking paying to go for a cab ride, and I want the air on and the window open,  let it happen.  Right.  Just let it happen.  I don't understand that either.  But they do that.  They have really bad AC in those cabs too, though.  That's terrible.  It blows a lot of warm air on you, hot air on you.  So, I don't know.  Yeah, we're, uh...  Fuck, this fucking thing.  I know, it's terrible.  The East Coast is, uh, destined to have this weather for a little while more, so... 
[00:09:00]  Perfect.  It's nice.  Perfect for me.  I love it.  I'll be somewhere where it's like 12 degrees cooler at all times.  Oh.  Canada.  How the fuck do you clear your throat, man?  It's terrible.  This tickle is ridiculous.  I got the fucking...  That blob, it feels like, that you just can't swallow in the back of your throat.  Yeah.  Right where the nose meets through, you just feel like you gotta go...  Anything worse when this comes on, and you're laying in bed, you just want to sleep, and  all you do is just swallow. 
[00:09:30]  Just swallowing.  Over and over again.  And you don't want to admit that you're getting sick.  It's like you're swallowing.  It must be something.  Swallowing, and then whatever the fuck you swallow down, for me, causes acid reflux to pop up.  I was like, it must have been the Don West Cards voice I was doing the other day.  Yeah, that must have been why my throat hurts, and then you realize, oh no, it's not it.  Well, you missed a fantastic show yesterday, and I'll tell you why.  I'll tell you why. 
[00:10:00]  I'll try that.  I had no voice.  Jeff Bridges was in, and he could be the coolest human being walking the earth.  He goes right to the top of one of my favorite guests we've ever had on the radio show.  He's great.  He's an A-lister, just sitting there, drinking his coffee, having a good time with that.  Yeah.  I wish I could do that better, Jamie.  How was he doing?  How was he doing?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  I can imagine.  And then he was pretty much hanging out here all day after the show. 
[00:10:30]  Just hanging out.  Yeah.  Like, you won an Oscar.  Signed books for us.  I think he was nominated five or six times, too, right?  And then finally won?  Yeah.  He's had a great career.  Was True Grit the first one he won for?  No.  I'm not sure.  Well, I like True Grit.  He won his Oscar for what?  Was it Crazy?  It wasn't Crazy Hard, right?  I forgot.  We should know this.  He's fucking True Grit, man.  Yeah, he was great.  The character was on. 
[00:11:00]  He plays a good kook.  Yeah, yeah.  When he wants to play a kook.  A kook.  He plays a good fucking nut dog.  Good kook.  A good kook.  But that wasn't the highlight of yesterday's show.  No?  Mm-mm.  Denny came in, and he told a terrific drive-in movie theater story.  Did he?  It was amazing.  Should we tell it again?  Yeah, we might have to put it on the podcast next week.  It was amazing.  You don't think you should retell it for Ant, do you? 
[00:11:30]  I don't know.  I don't know if we can do it justice.  That's the only thing that I think.  It was amazing.  Can you give me a synopsis?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know if I can give it...  It was really good the way he did it.  Huh?  The way he did it was really good.  And we got his walk-on music, too, now.  So that's good.  Oh, he's got walk-on music.  Yeah.  Remember how we listened to the radio?  Oh.  And I said, that's the place to be.  And how I got the job as an FM job. 
[00:12:00]  The day you married me.  It was two kids and I was into AM rock.  But I just had to run around.  It's been eight years since I left you, babe.  Let me tell you about what's gone down.  I am the morning DJ.  Oh, wow.  Well, not really.  Right, Denny?  You don't.  I'm almost the morning DJ.  I am the morning DJ when the morning DJ's sick.  Yes. 
[00:12:30]  I'm friends with the morning DJ.  Can we put a little edit in that song and just put almost?  I'm kind of.  A kind of?  No.  Not even kind of.  I'm almost.  He's going to get the call any day, though.  He's prepped.  But, man, he tells a terrific story, I'll tell you.  Yeah.  The drive-in story was good.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I had a realization on the show yesterday.  My grandma had a house in Waiting River, and it was a summer house.  It was beautiful.  And on the way back to Centerport, Long Island, we would pass the Rocky Point drive-in movie theater. 
[00:13:00]  And about a mile down the road, you could start hearing the movie.  We'd roll down the fucking windows.  It was always some kind of Disney classic.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of Disney movies.  And then if we were lucky enough to make the red light, and yes, I said make the red light,  that means we could stop.  And now six, seven, maybe eight heads, depending on who, like I said, was in my family at the time, 
[00:13:30]  would all stick our heads out the window to watch the movie at the red light.  And I brought this to the show yesterday as a nice childhood memory.  Sure.  But then I had the realization that my parents never fucking stopped, and we never actually  went into the drive-in.  Yeah, that's terrible.  The drive-in.  You should have at least gone once.  We never went once.  And now I'm like thinking, why? 
[00:14:00]  Why didn't we ever go?  Well, the Hughes's seemed like they were a bit thrifty.  Well, it was my mom.  So that might have, you know, been one of the reasons.  She ruled with an iron fist.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Not going to go sit in that drive-in theater.  No drive-in movie, and we had to share a fan.  Yeah, yeah.  That was our summer.  One fan for the rest of the day.  Summer of 69.  But I thought it was a good memory, and then I'm realizing, no, that's a shitty memory.  Because now I'm realizing they never fucking made that right turn into the... 
[00:14:30]  Wouldn't you just one time go, ah, what the hell?  Oh, I see the movie times, you know.  Yeah, hereby the love bug is playing.  8.30, and whoa, you know what, kids?  It happens to be 8.15.  What the hell?  We don't need to get home right away.  The Shaggy DA is playing.  Jesus.  I think I'll...  Right, maybe that's a little earlier.  I hope so.  The Boatniks are playing.  But that led to, you know, Denny's terrific drive-in movie. 
[00:15:00]  Denny have some memories?  Theater story.  Yeah, it was terrific.  The Shaggy DA was 1976.  Oh, there you go.  So it could have very well been.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  Would they have color?  Dean Jones and Tim Conway.  They'd color?  All right.  I don't know.  Why are you making fun of 1976?  I'll take that.  I was, you know, being a child of the 80s, I certainly saw some of the, you know, the 
[00:15:30]  movies from the 70s as a little, little squirt.  Be happy that you missed the Bicentennial.  Yes.  And John Wayne Gacy.  The 200th anniversary of Our Wonderful Nation.  Yeah, I was just starting to, you know, walk when that went down, Sam.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was just starting to walk.  I don't know.  This video of me as a little kid just starting to, like, walk across the living room. 
[00:16:00]  And the Bicentennial just happened to be on TV in the background.  Yeah.  So, I can prove that.  See?  It's been a late bloomer.  What?  Nothing.  Yeah, maybe a little over a year.  Would you have polio?  I just started to walk.  Forrest Gump races.  You're not buying that one?  No, not unless you had them magic legs.  Did you almost buy it, though?  No, not for a second.  Fuck!  Well, that's it.  Did you ever see Computer War Tennis Shoes? 
[00:16:30]  What?  That was another one.  The what?  That was Disney.  I actually remember that one.  Computer War Tennis Shoes.  Kurt Russell, right?  I believe that was Kurt Russell.  Yeah, he was the king of the Disney movie.  Young Kurt Russell was in a lot of those Disney movies.  Yeah, so.  Oh, Jesus.  He used to play that Sunday ABC Disney thing.  Yeah.  It's just why I remembered it.  Because in 95, they remade it with Kurt Cameron.  No!  That's right up.  It was made for a TV movie.  I remember watching that one.  Which means he had to throw a God angle into it. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  He loves Jesus.  I mean, you can love Jesus all you want.  That's fine.  But Kurt Cameron ruined his entire fucking career.  Yeah.  Over the God thing.  Jesus.  Decided not to take any roles unless there was some kind of God angle in there.  Yeah.  He went all in with the God.  And married an old friend of mine.  What's his name?  Oh, well, you know, I mean, good line, but he's the one that really hates the figs. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  He does.  Remember, he hates the figs.  He hates them.  Well, you know why.  And if you say figs like that, you're okay, by the way.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  I asked some people.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Just say it that way and you're fine.  Is this the video where he talks about hating the figs?  It's a love worth fighting.  Love worth fighting for marriage event.  See, now he doesn't say, you know.  Why is Kurt Cameron so obsessed with this?  Well, the religion.  You could not like it, I guess.  That's obviously your prerogative. 
[00:18:00]  But to be all bent out of shape about it, there's something going on there deep inside.  Because Kurt Cameron is a fucking asshole, that's why.  Wow.  He married the coolest chick from Geneseo who, you know, we were all friends with because  she was in the communications department.  Some would know her as Nancy Noble.  I knew her as Nancy Mueller.  And then I think her name was Chelsea Noble for a while.  And she was on Seinfeld.  How about that?  She was one of Jerry's girls.  Really?  What episode?  And she was also on Cheers. 
[00:18:30]  She did a lot of, like, walk-ons.  What episode of Seinfeld?  I don't know, because I'm not a Seinfeld guy like you.  But she was a good friend of ours in college.  See, which one she was.  Now I'm impressed.  Huh?  Now I'm impressed.  Yeah.  Her.  Well, that's her older now.  She was fucking beautiful.  Yeah, come on.  She was a stunner in college.  And then she ends up marrying Kurt Cameron.  We're like, what?  Whatever.  She's probably happy. 
[00:19:00]  Don't be jealous that she found Jesus.  Jesus.  Oh, she's on Growing Pains.  Yes, she was.  I think that's where she met Mr. Cameron.  The English Patient.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah.  Elaine is dragged to see the movie The English Patient.  Oh, she hates it.  On multiple occasions.  Yes.  Even though, as Anthony stated, she absolutely hates it.  All right.  Yeah, she hates The English Patient.  All right.  Let's talk about it.  So who was she?  She was just, I don't know.  I think she's just Jerry's girlfriend, I guess.  Jerry's girl in it?  I think so. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, okay.  She plays Danielle.  And that wasn't a Big Jerry's girl thing, I guess.  Yeah, she's a Geneseo alumni.  She was beyond cool.  And Kurt Cameron, you mean, you say is with the gay marriage obsession.  Now, Travis knows everything.  You really know who she is?  Travis is the best Seinfeld trivia guy ever.  Better than you?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  She played Neil's girlfriend?  Neil's girlfriend. 
[00:20:00]  Who looks like George?  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Right.  What?  Yeah, it is.  George stays one step ahead of Neil.  Neil.  Oh, I am sorry.  I am supposed to be my boyfriend here.  He looks just like you.  Right.  Yeah.  Like me.  Sorry.  Like me.  But how?  It's very funny.  But how?  I'm in the coffee shop. 
[00:20:30]  And this beautiful girl I could never even talk to mistakes me for her boyfriend.  That's a nice four seconds.  This is what her boyfriend looks like.  How is that possible?  Maybe he has money.  Oh, maybe he doesn't.  Maybe he and I are exactly the same except for one minor yet crucial detail.  You never know.  Sometimes you do.  Maybe it's some small thing I could change.  Like a mustache or a top hat or a monocle or a cane. 
[00:21:00]  Who's she dating?  Mr. Peanut?  You're a lot worse than Mr. Peanut, my friend.  That's been great.  You're going to love it.  Hi.  Remember me?  I'm the guy that looks like Neil.  Hi.  Hi.  Is Neil here?  Oh, no.  He got a hell of a good work.  Oh, that's too bad.  I kind of wanted to meet him seeing how he looks so similar. 
[00:21:30]  Well, you know, you don't look that much like him.  Oh.  What's that?  No, you're a little taller.  You look like you're in better shape than Neil.  Listen, I don't mean to seem forward, but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?  Okay, great. 
[00:22:00]  Now we're just watching.  I know.  Let's just watch Seinfeld.  I've never seen.  I've never really seen.  Really?  The only thing that I saw was the music was too much.  Really?  The music would distract me.  Yeah.  But the genius storyline.  What?  The music went in between scenes where they just did that little thing?  Yeah.  Boom.  Boom.  It was like loud.  It was very 90s.  She's pretty, that girl.  She's gorgeous.  Is that her family girl?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Damn.  Yeah, that's who we ended up marrying, who I know.  Don't show me the end of the scene that one.  Boom.  I saw the one last night where George quit his job. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  Where George quit his job and then just showed up because he regretted it.  I love that one.  He's just like, what?  No.  No, that was a joke.  Because that's why it's boss.  That's why I'm here and you're over there.  Just the way he does his hands.  It was great.  Last laugh.  And then they were talking about that episode and the behind the scenes thing and George was  like, well, you know, Jason Alexander was like, I'd read some of these things and be 
[00:23:00]  like, this is ridiculous.  That could never happen in real life.  Like, I don't even know how to play this.  And then it turned out that Larry David actually did that at SNL.  He had quit.  He walked in, gave this little speech about how he was quitting and his problems with  the place quit and then thought better of it and then just was like, well, if I just  show up for work again and just sit down and never acknowledge it.  Did it work?  No. 
[00:23:30]  It didn't for George either.  He's a fucking Larry David with story structure.  And he does it on Curb, too.  Yes.  Brilliant.  And I know most of these stories just because people tell me what the story was.  And I watched one Curb, the Palestinian chicken episode.  Oh, God.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was great.  What a brilliant fucking guy, man.  You never watch Curb?  No.  That's one you should watch.  Not because I don't like them.  I just don't watch so many shows.  You'd appreciate Curb.  The fact that he's still able to create that after so many years and make it work, so many 
[00:24:00]  people do it and it's terrible.  It's genius.  Well, he started his own genre, really, because so many people are doing kind of the Curb thing  now.  But doesn't he take, like, he has a very, very coherent and smart storyline and then  wraps another one into it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A B story.  You should watch Curb, man.  It's going to depress me.  That's why I don't watch TV.  I don't want to be depressed by these shows and how great they are.  Their greatness will depress me.  Anyway, it leads to her marrying Kirk Cameron. 
[00:24:30]  Yes.  Why are we talking about Kirk Cameron today?  Because he loves Jesus and hates the figs.  True.  But how did we get to this point?  Computer wore tennis shoes.  Yeah, we were talking about computer wore tennis shoes.  Oh, right.  The remake of the Disney movie.  Wow.  Okay, and then he ruined his...  Oh, because your drive-in thing, yeah.  And he pretty much ruined his career by obsessing about the Gwad thing.  And decide not to take any roles because, you know, the Gwad thing.  And it comes into play.  And I don't know if God would appreciate it if I do this role. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  So then...  You know, there's a fucking revolution in Syria.  Right.  And this idiot thinks God cares about who he fucking pretends to be.  So then he decides to start doing projects where he promotes Gwad.  Oh, I don't know.  You know, if my old friend there is happy, whatever.  But I can't believe it's the same broad.  She was...  How old is she?  She's probably my age.  Is she older than him?  He's probably up there now, too.  Oh, yeah.  All in the same ballpark.  Right. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Right around there.  She might have been a year younger than you.  All born in the mid to late 70s.  80s.  I wasn't born in the late 70s.  When?  Mid?  Yeah.  Late 60s.  Mid.  Mid 70s.  Yeah.  I'll take...  I'll take...  Man, you look like shit over...  Wow, you look old.  Any day.  Any day.  Take that any day.  Is this Kirk talking about the figs? 
[00:26:00]  Yes.  Let's hear it.  How old is it?  He's talking...  This is like last year.  No, this is 2013.  It's not anti-gay.  It's pro-marriage.  Pro-love is what it is.  Let's be real here.  I love this.  My name's Kirk Cameron.  Hi, Kirk.  And together with Warren Barfield, we are putting on an incredible event that is designed  to fireproof marriages.  Maybe you saw the movie Fireproof.  Maybe that resonated in your heart and in the heart of your church. 
[00:26:30]  Probably some religious movie.  See?  Fireproof.  He was in a movie called Fireproof.  Nobody's watching that movie.  Well, he said maybe you saw Fireproof.  He means...  I realize I had nothing funny to say.  I know.  I was going to say he means like nobody watched it.  I realize there's nowhere to go with that he means.  Yeah.  He blew off a major career in Hollywood to do the Gawad thing.  He's doing the work of Jesus.  Some guy named Warren Barfield.  Barfield.  Yeah, no, he said it ain't like it should ring out in every household. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Working with Warren Barfield.  Yeah, you know.  Barf.  Barf.  Field.  Barf.  Let's hear the rest of this video.  Unity.  Well, this event, in essence, takes the movie and turns it into a live experience.  Wow.  Oh, God.  We want to pull down as many barriers and walls that would separate us from coming together  around the gospel.  Can you pause this again?  For the sake. 
[00:27:30]  I want one person to prove to me that Christian rock doesn't suck a dick.  Oh, it's the worst music.  Give me one Christian rock band.  It's terrible.  Creed.  Oh, wow.  Are they Christian rock?  Striper.  Striper?  Are they officially a Christian rock band?  I don't know.  Weren't they?  Creed had some Gawad songs.  Oh, yeah.  I kind of like Creed.  Anytime.  I kind of did.  You don't like them, Sam?  No, it's the shittiest band ever.  It's easy to fucking hate on Creed, but I'm going to sit here and go, you know what?  They had a couple of catchy songs. 
[00:28:00]  No, they sucked always.  E-Rock, play one of the catchy songs from Creed.  I don't know.  I know you have.  It's just queued up, ready to go.  Anytime there's a church thing done in, like, a stadium with people shutting their eyes,  looking up and waving their hands and crying, there's a problem.  Yeah.  Those people have problems.  If you all have to get together in a massive stadium just to talk to God, you're irritating.  Wide open.  His arms wide open?  Yeah.  Oh, are they a religious group?  Yeah.  Well, they kind of went a little...  I didn't know that.  They're like secret Christian rock. 
[00:28:30]  They were secret Christian rock.  I'm fair enough, Sam.  They didn't tell anyone.  They totally were, though.  And then one day you wake up and go, wait a minute, I think he's singing about Jesus.  Yeah, you're trying to figure out why they suck so much, and then you realize it's Christian  rock.  I can't say they suck.  They were on the only station that really rocked for a while.  Bro, bro.  Wait, I found a worse one.  Terrified.  Oh, this is rockin'.  See, this is rockin'. 
[00:29:00]  I'm going to shut my eyes and look up.  Yeah, but you can almost hear it in it now when you listen to it.  Like, imagine people with their hands on it and talking to Jesus.  And it's keeping quiet, but I think he might have liked a Creed song or two himself.  No.  Come on.  No, that whole brr, brr, brr.  I hate that style.  Don't like them.  Then you must hate the 90s, Jim Norton.  What's that?  You must hate the 90s, then.  Yeah, I don't like the 90s.  You know me.  I don't love a lot of 90s music. 
[00:29:30]  We haven't talked about 90s rock in a while.  I wish I liked it.  E-Rock.  E-Rock comedy?  I was so happy when everybody figured out that Creed sucked.  Didn't take long.  All right, you can turn this.  All right.  Let's get back to Kirk Cameron.  Yeah, let's go back to the video.  The wonderfulness of marriage and using that as a guise to hating homosexuals.  You think he likes Creed?  Who's worse?  Who's worse?  Creed or Nickelback? 
[00:30:00]  Oof.  Nickelback's probably worse than Creed.  What's that big song?  They've had a lot of big songs.  E-Rock.  Got it.  Hit him.  Hit us up with the Nickelback song, E-Rock.  Come on.  All right.  Big hit.  Nickelback.  Mr. Avril Lavigne and Nickelback is really bad.  I say Nickelback way worse than Creed.  Probably.  Not even close.  Both bands really suck, but Nickelback's probably worse.  I could say Creed sucks.  They're horrible.  I'm not going to go through a whole album of Creed, but I'll take a hit, a couple hits. 
[00:30:30]  Only to make fun of it.  No.  Not fair.  Like to sing it and do the voice for a little while.  That's funny.  That is fun.  The Christian Rock fans are checking in.  Oh, are they?  Brian and Tampa.  I know we're all over the place, but the beauty of this show, we'll bring it right back together,  and we'll fucking have this all wrapped up nice for you.  You want to hear what he thinks are two great Christian Rock bands?  Yeah, please.  All right, Brian.  Sell us on Christian Rock.  Go ahead.  First of all, I'm not a Christian follower, but I'm a metal follower. 
[00:31:00]  Okay.  And for guitar players, there is a killer guitar player in a band called Eden's Curse,  and an 80s band called White Cross.  Jimmy would probably like those bands.  Ah, they have to have the names.  Brian, I'm not laughing at you.  I'm laughing at the names of the bands.  Eden's Curse.  Eden's Curse.  Hey, you going to go see Eden's Curse?  You get Eden's Curse tickets?  Fuck, and White Cross is opening.  I'm going to see them, man. 
[00:31:30]  Fuck, this is a dream in heaven.  All right, all right.  All right, I like that guitar.  Y-Rock has decided to play the music really loud today for some reason.  I think that's...  Oh, damn me.  No, that's Sam.  I'm sorry, Y-Rock.  Look at this guy.  They look completely metal, but...  I like...  You know what?  I like this so far.  But this is Satan's music.  Hold on, Brian. 
[00:32:00]  We can't hear you.  Yeah.  Hold on, Brian.  We can't hear you.  No, no, no.  Excuse me.  All right.  We can't hear you.  very very produced it sounds like it sounds good they sound like a heavy metal version of sticks 
[00:32:30]  yeah yes  hate that guy on the keyboard i don't like him he sucks  you got the long hair and the beard yeah  what a spaz it is like heavy metal fucking heavy metal journey you know what brian i can't beat you 
[00:33:00]  up for that that's a cool little sound right there well i appreciate that i know the white  cross is definitely 80 so it's not up to date but the guitar player really does smoke right and  i'm sorry i don't have anything for anthony called hitler's ball sack  look at you racist hitler's ball sack you know the problem with christian rock groups they all 
[00:33:30]  have to sing about god right yeah i wouldn't mind them if for a while they sang about something else  but literally the second version ba ba ba ba heaven right we know there's a lot of great heaven songs  out there though there really are brian adams probably is the best one well we could do a  heaven fucking song isn't too far away that's the one i was thinking about yeah yeah uh brian adams  acoustic version of fucking heaven on the mtv acoustic because it could be 
[00:34:00]  to it every day warrant of course that might be the best heaven song no it's not that's gonna be  the best heaven song not eden's curse though that is good fuck man i can't beat that up eden's curse  it's very well produced clean uh metal but they kind of you know they know their instruments though  they they they're very good that's right off of the uh that's right out of the metal textbook that's  it was very there it's very clean it's too clean to be like very very easy the definition of metal 
[00:34:30]  it's yes as i lay dying christian rock singer got arrested for putting a hit on his wife whoops  that's not christian like no let's learn about christian rock today aaron is this a true story  what do you got on this yeah what's up fuckers um basically uh yeah it and this happened a few  months ago uh tim lambis the singer of as they lay dying a long time christian rock band and they  probably play him on a uh liquid metal all the time uh he got it guy started fucking getting really

[00:40:00]  whole thing up nice now with a kiss so kirk cameron is talking about the feigs yeah this video  well the sanctity of marriage and he made some bible movie that no one saw but then he's like well now  we're taking the bible movie on the road and making it a live experience this is love worth fighting for  all right marriage event gospel for the sake of building up our marriages and our families 
[00:40:30]  if we're concerned about the future of the church we've got to heal the family and it's got to be  done in a gospel-centered way that's what love worth fighting for is all about  no love is not a fight but it's a marriage event he's he's jesus crazy but is that even though those  guys are anti-gay that is that a veiled anti-gay it seems like you just might be because marriages 
[00:41:00]  are falling i mean that's the pro marriage that's not in there oh yeah that's to get you there after  they close the doors close the door oh boy all right let's talk about the fix oh boy you're  you're homosexual you think oh yeah there's a little trickery to get you in the door just get  yeah and it's like this is nice you know what it's nice our marriage we got to work on it and  and a gospel-centric thing and it's kirk cameron he was wonderful and that show

[00:43:00]  opinion about it and all that obviously but to really just be so obsessed with why does it move  anybody internally like to do anything who gives a what would you think about it i don't i don't know  some people just get really revved but you know what i'm saying it's like like we're like  interracial marriage like what what inside of you is so like i gotta you know i don't comprehend that  fucking people give a yeah there's so much i don't give a shit like like there are things you don't  have to sit and like fucking protest for or anything you just don't think about it there's so many things i 
[00:43:30]  just don't think about gays are one of them i just do but whatever they want to do why what i give a  shit some gay guys want to get married gay women dude people are born gay gay gay gay gay so what does  kirk cameron want does he want like uh us to drown all the gays he doesn't want those gays married it's  literally people i love religious people that go after gay people because they're critics it's it's almost 
[00:44:00]  like if you're born gay then i guess god made you that way so it's like really right they're like  fans so who are fucking or or they're they're they're fans of a particular performer and then when  the performers doing one of their songs they're going this song sucks it should be banned like but  but they made that song it's like if you really like god and god made gay people then you're just  you're just well they don't see it that way i know that they don't think you're born gay right no  that's their little out yes god made you normal oh and you turned gay because of the devil yeah

[00:48:30]  a great window uh uh off of 57th street when we used to have our own beautiful facility yeah before  they put us in this little uh box here at uh the serious uh and we were able to look out onto the  street and so we we put a whole bunch of porn down on the sidewalk uh and then uh kind of just  commented as people were picking up the porno right yeah there were dildos and x-rated movies and  what else t-shirts t-shirts and it's a great bit it really is a great bit we all had our own window 
[00:49:00]  i remember in a microphone it was so much fun that's what was great was that we actually left  the studio right and opened the windows open the windows took wireless mics and just broadcast it was  awesome it was great it was really really that's one of my favorite bits ever really yeah yeah because  it was so different like i'd never heard or been involved in anything like that right and and when  when bill would yell down at these people that were picking stuff up oh god yeah classic because the 
[00:49:30]  the best part is they they're looking around like wait is is that a dildo and then like girls women  were picking them up putting them in their purse thinking they were getting away with something  some guy like like saw porno and then doubled back made sure no one was looking right picked it up  and then bill just instantly oh we had the megaphone too i remember so we would shout at them all right  okay yeah that and box of cocks are two of my favorites box of cocks that was amazing i was just 
[00:50:00]  fucking do you remember how outraged you were when management would said you could not do box of  cocks a second time and you were like outraged like you couldn't believe somebody was infringing on  your right right to do box of cocks we put a box on the sidewalk and it said what free kittens inside  yeah i think it's free puppies free puppies right and it was a giant cardboard box and the entire  inside was lined with pictures of gay porn yes hardcore and then there was a dildo affixed to 
[00:50:30]  the bottom of the box so people would go by and then we videoed from across the street and we just  put it out on the sidewalk box of cocks and then people would go by and open up the box expecting to  see puppies and they'd be shocked and all i got was cocks we're fucking grown-ups right that's when  we would just think of something and just we are lucky to still have a gig it's amazing that we didn't  as much as this place is can be annoying i can't believe we didn't blow it this place is uh extremely 
[00:51:00]  sterile unfortunately i mean we do box of cocks here like in the lobby oh god what unless it was a  christmas gift to management that they'd all reach in and greedily grab them like they were candies  is box of cocks uh worth putting on the podcast i think so yeah absolutely as a radio bit was it  good because i know visually it was hilarious i believe it was yeah all right we have to make  sure it's good for uh for radio purposes or for podcast purposes all right so uh podcast number  10 is stalker patty's mousetraps she's uh crawling around naked with uh a crusty the clown mask on 
[00:51:30]  and street fishing with bill burr there it is oh oh oh oh here's a girl here's a girl  she looked into the box and was horrified a lady look at him and shut the lid quickly lady with a cane  no what was great was she's hoping to the audience and she slowly opens up what was great was when

[00:56:00]  charge of that but he was not allowed to write an analysis of his work yeah i found that odd they could  submit um what they found like a computer that gathers information but doesn't collate the information  and then you have to give that off to uh the feds i gather where they then determined what happened  they then put it in a file yeah oh really yeah do not open yeah no they passed it around to the caa  yeah yeah and typically they would be allowed to write analysis for what they saw yes this is 
[00:56:30]  unprecedented everybody you remember the uh the medical examiner also said he wasn't he wasn't  allowed to write an analysis and the medical examiner yeah so generally what you do is and that's what  happened nobody wrote an analysis none of these groups that were part of the investigation wrote an  analysis well at least the ones we spoke to we didn't speak there may have been some but at least the  ones we spoke to is that common i don't know well that's true there might have been yeah i can't yeah  yeah is that common though that they're not allowed it's unprecedented it is unprecedented i 
[00:57:00]  need to okay put that on the record that's strange the analysis is is what tells you what the information  right and then everybody's analyses are supposed to come together and form a picture of what happened  and this is unprecedented that they weren't allowed to write it up there that's so weird the official  manner of death has never been finalized by the medical and we're only finding this out now many years  later we have we found it's a while you know no you guys found out how many years ago well about  that particular thing during this documentary that's what i'm saying yeah yeah wow yeah that's 
[00:57:30]  great the question everybody asks is the main question i know you may not have the answer because  the documentary was amazing and i also i hate conspiracy shit i'm like i'm right but this really  roped me in and it made me see things very differently with this oh i'm the same way um yeah it's hard  too but when when eyewitnesses are saying they saw something that they're credible it's kind of hard to  the question i have is why would they cover it up what is the motive behind it what is the what who  wins in that because they went bankrupt after that didn't that's yes i mean that's one of the reasons 
[00:58:00]  why we're filing this petition you know because we want them not only to review what they did that was  wrong and review the forensic evidence properly but we want them to tell us who did it yeah and we can't  really speculate in our position because if we do that's when we get nailed that's when we get looped  in i don't know loop placed in those other categories of conspiracy right because we can't speculate if  we do we'll get and with that why hasn't anyone come forward to claim responsibility again that's one 
[00:58:30]  of those questions um there are many possibilities what may have caused this right um and i just can't  even say which there are two kind of possibilities here which are the two again for the people out  there well i think the two most obvious we say it was a proximity-fused missile well the two well  there's probably going to be the most likely would be either terrorists or a military exercise wrong  or some kind of test gone wrong right and we're not going to say which one we believe is more  strong i mean it seems like a test goes wrong uh seems like like it's the one because a group would 
[00:59:00]  have claimed responsibility why blow up an airliner and then not talk about it unless again speculating  purely speculating maybe it was somebody in the military who was uh uh sympathetic to uh iran  did he go rogue yeah he went rogue and this might be okay now you're getting grassy i am  shoot down an iranian passenger plane by mistake over the ocean over the persian gulf yeah yeah so it's  like and then one of ours has shot down a passenger plane it could be completely unconnected maybe i'm 
[00:59:30]  just making noises right now my mouth you like the grassy knoll have you ever been to dallas have you  checked out area i have not checked out the grassy knolls it's it's a great afternoon we've been  there yeah you did it's total oh my god you gotta do it we were there for hours and then you stand on  the x where it happened and take your picture and all that fun stuff yeah i uh i can't believe you  haven't been there but they're not conspiracy people no thank you thank you but steely plaza and it's a big 
[01:00:00]  event it's just a good thing to go uh this is i i guess like i said i went into it like i just it's  gonna it's gonna be infuriate me and uh it infuriated me but in a different way i was like wow this  there really are some a lot of loose ends on this one why didn't the uh ntsb have this investigation  like it would if they're claiming it was some kind of mechanical problem a wiring problem why such  involvement with the fbi and even the cia instead of just the ntsb well the cia there was just no 
[01:00:30]  reason that's that's another unprecedented thing i can understand if perhaps they knew it was  terrorism and and and it's a crime scene and you want the fbi and maybe even the cia if there are  some things going on uh but since they discounted it to just mechanical failure how do they then justify  them being so involved well the cia actually in the very beginning they wanted to see if this was a  terrorist missile so the cia are the experts are foreign missiles and things and then be very  beginning that was okay which makes sense sure sure so that but then they started producing a video of 
[01:01:00]  what the eyewitnesses saw right and that's what was wrong because they never interviewed a single  eyewitness and they and they said this was not a missile yeah they wanted to show what the people  didn't see right and they never talked to the people yeah and by the way not one um through a lawsuit  he got a bunch of documents cia documents um and again it was the same thing they gathered all this  information okay but the analysis part uh-huh that was all redacted jeez wow isn't it amazing you have 
[01:01:30]  to sue to get this information too why is this cop if it's just a plane crash or an explosion of the  center fuel tank is they said why is that so much is put under the guise of national security these days  and and it's not it's not national security but they can say well this will show how we obtain  this and that and it's 20 degrees separation to national security so they could just black it out  it's amazing what's covered under that now well it's also very interesting it's not in the documentary 
[01:02:00]  is there was a video of a missile five days before the crash over long island really defense  intelligence agency confirmed that there was a missile on the videotape that is a aircraft or a ac mechanic  on top of the roof of a hospital uh filming the sunrise and the missile went up hey look at the  rocket wow and he brought it to the fbi after this crash saying hey is this significant they made 10  copies we requested those copies they lost them they're all gone they lost the dog ate their homework  they certainly do lose a lot of stuff all those copies oh my god of course of course they didn't lose 
[01:02:30]  that's what they're actually saying yeah yeah yes they told me they look where they're supposed to be  they couldn't find them where's the original i contacted the guy finally found the guy and they're very  leery i spoke to his wife and i'm not even mention his name because he's so leery about being involved  not that he doesn't believe this he does he actually his wife says you know she doesn't say anything but  the silence is deafening you know on the phone you know what you know but he believes even in his fbi  document that it was a rocket or missile and and he's in arizona right now and you know that's that's 
[01:03:00]  one of the interesting things about pursuing this story is how many frightened people there are  surrounding the story when we were trying to get experts you know uh engineers who are experts in  in um determining the the signature of uh exploded missiles on airplanes yeah i mean we literally  called all over the world and the minute people figured out what this was pertaining to they said i  can't talk about that yeah i said why no i can't answer that let me just send you this no then you can say 
[01:03:30]  you sent it to me wow yeah they wouldn't let me send them an email you know it's part of the fear  you think though like in this day and age if you're linked with conspiracy and again because so many  like crackpots have made like a legitimate investigation seem like conspiracy they might  be afraid of having their name tied in like oh great now it's almost like if you work in science if  you're a part of seti then people think you're crazy because you're looking for aliens maybe they're  afraid of being lumped in with what's considered a conspiracy well actually um one one guy told us that 
[01:04:00]  that he had uh he had connections and contracts uh with uh connections to and contracts with the  pentagon it's don't want to lose those exactly yeah so i mean but think about it think about the  implications for this country that you can't get to the bottom of something like this where 230 civilians  died right you know and then it takes us 17 years just to get to where we are i mean this is not the 
[01:04:30]  only story out there yeah like this and so what does that say it would unless unless it was some type of  cover-up for a military accident i would like to like jim said know what the end game was for this whole  thing like why wouldn't you attribute it to terrorism unless maybe i i guess you don't  want to seem like you're vulnerable but someone would claim responsibility it seems like the only 
[01:05:00]  real end game here is to protect like oops we made a mistake don't want anybody to know but then i also  heard uh uh about that like how could you keep that many people quiet is usually the thing and there  would be a a guy on the ship if it was a ship launch missile that would be like you know yeah i i heard a  missile go off at that hour you can't you can't keep an entire ship quiet uh so you know any well  you know it's interesting that you say that because look at the marginalization of the eyewitnesses 
[01:05:30]  you saw that part in the film where i i i asked the uh the fbi agent i said you know you're telling us  this is mass misperception all these people up and down that's ridiculous you know mass miss who didn't  even know each other yeah you know they all say the same thing and you're just shunting them aside  and that has survived that mass misperception concept has survived i mean we're fighting obviously 
[01:06:00]  against it but think about that for a minute if you can do that to more than 600 eyewitnesses in this case  think about it and then it's kind of terrifying yeah and they cite this case to say oh look how  the eyewitnesses can be wrong so now eyewitnesses have no no well sometimes they do get things wrong  i'm not saying that true but when you have amazing uh consistency mass of eyewitnesses it's just like  you know and what i find interesting is i don't know if you guys i watch uh you know 48 48 hours i 
[01:06:30]  watch i've worked with dea agents i've worked with detectives you know and they'll tell you when they  get onto a crime scene what's the first thing you do did anybody see you yeah yeah you talk to  potential witnesses and and those witnesses go to court they go to court people are you know sent to  jail based on eyewitness testimony sure and here we have we have more than 90 eyewitnesses all up and  down the coast who saw the event from start to finish and there and the event was they they feel  like they saw a flare a flare coming some of them called it a missile right uh some of a lot of them 
[01:07:00]  called it uh a rocket uh you know and didn't they say it went up unevenly almost because that like  there was a really weird pattern they said that it went up uh almost like something right many of  them who didn't know each other didn't actually talk to each other said it went up you know from  the surface first of all the plane was at 10 minutes into its flight to paris it was way up there  2.6 miles 13 800 feet and went up and all many many people say then it turned left as if it was  heading towards something else then it turned left the last second and boom i'll tell you so that's yeah that's 
[01:07:30]  what they say and they're they're all saying that i'm trying to interrupt you the pilot you guys had  on was very convincing yeah oh yeah because they he was up at what 2 000 feet yeah 5 000 maybe 5 000  and he saw it go past him from below him from the ground passes altitude yeah yeah that's that's a  difficult one to write on yeah right there is yeah and then you have to look at you have to look at  what i call the the moving target rationale which is you know there were explosives all over the  residue explosive residue all over the plane inside and out and first they tell you oh it 
[01:08:00]  was a dog sniffing exercise there were only three positive hits actually and that was because of a  dog training exercise and we blew that out of the water because when that dog training exercise was  allegedly occurring on the plane the crew was already on that plane and the guy said he was on  an empty plane so that's been blown out and they would put they would put some type of explosive  residue right right there for the dog bring the dog through he sniffs it and it's like good boy  good boy and now we leave right they said he spilled some and the guy we talked to he said no it didn't 
[01:08:30]  spill any but not only no but not only that but we proved that the crew was already on board by the  time the guy finished the right the timeline never worked out the timeline yeah so then they move it  they move it they say well the machines the machines the aegis the explosive detective machine  gives frequent false positives so then we talk talk to the inventor of the aegis machine  wow good for you and he said he says on the contrary we also talked to the the super the lab one of the 
[01:09:00]  lab supervisors at the fbi at the time who says oh no it was a fairy so then they move it again  and they well then they just a couple weeks ago they said it dissolves in water and it doesn't it's  insoluble in water these explosives i mean it's so it keeps they keep evolving with their to keep the  story what how they want it yeah it just seems very odd that it could stay covered up for this long  um because i i mean i bought the story i bought the story i'm going to tell you about the official 
[01:09:30]  story it because of the official source the official source reporting that's what it is because what  happens is when kallstrom jim kallstrom the head of the fbi investigation he gets on tv and he goes  it wasn't a missile it's not a missile and he presents the cia animation everybody just writes  oh kallstrom said it's not a missile no one says no one says is kallstrom lying nobody checks into it  we had we had a conversation with a senior producer of a major network which you know we were on the 
[01:10:00]  phone with this guy because we you know he produced a documentary full of inaccuracies that they keep  bearing oh you can probably figure out and we said to him i finally said to him just out of i said  listen i said when you interviewed jim kallstrom or uh jim hall the uh chairman at the time i said don't  you fact check what they say and i swear to god this guy said and his boss was on the phone too 
[01:10:30]  he said that's not my job he said my job is just to tell people present their perspective to people  and that that gentlemen is why you and the country are having a hard time wrapping your minds around  the actual facts because official source reporting has created created virtual realities on a number of  major stories and the more time that goes by the harder it is to prove anything different than the  official story because it's just been ingrained in people's minds you know i i was like oh the the 
[01:11:00]  flaming debris falling would reflect in the water and look like it was going up and people could get  the misconception that they're seeing something rising up when indeed something's falling but uh  after watching the documentary i mean changing directions it's a sand in front of you or sand in  front of you and not actually seeing the water at all or there were plenty of things that like  i i as i watched i was just like my god how did i buy this for so long where pilots say because 
[01:11:30]  i bought the cia the cia animation where it said that the uh the you know the wing engines were  unaffected so it continued uh rising right without the front and then the pilots going there's no way  that that's a possible plane can't go up without the front of the plane yeah tom explain that tom the  science guy will explain this very very clearly to your audience but yeah let's just say that maybe  it is possible give him that right okay you know and you ride a bike up a steep hill you know  you slow down right so when you're climbing that high the engines can't do it so it's got to  slow down it's got to convert airspeed to altitude and that's what their simulations show 
[01:12:00]  it a significant speed reduction right well the radar data shows no speed reduction at all  the radar data shows that maintaining airspeed turning left and going down going down and they knew that  we have ca documents that they compared their stuff to the radar before they released that  animation knew it was wrong and released it anyway yeah that's why he's suing their butts  right yeah we got them in federal court to give us those documents wow oh have you seen those  documents we have them i can give you a copy yeah but what are you suing them for to get to get more 
[01:12:30]  documents we have an eyewitness on the phone oh great yeah let's go with this uh mike in boston mike  hey what's up guys hey uh listen uh i was i was an officer in the coast guard at the time that that that  this whole went down okay and uh you know i i had a lot of people working for me i had three  individuals individually come up to me and say sir i saw something fly up at that thing 
[01:13:00]  yeah and i i i can't corroborate it but i swear to you that's the truth three three people  completely respectable individuals came up to me without me prompting and they said hey i saw  something fly up at that point there's just too many witnesses that have the same  story they're the skeletons to just throw it away in the closet they will not stay in the closet  thanks man thanks wow yeah that was the hardest part for me to write off was the because any type  of official well this this exactly this guy said any of that i can my my mind can go well the official 
[01:13:30]  report but that was the hard part was the eyewitnesses who individually and independently saw the same  thing and i'm like these are not dummies this is just regular people working and they look up they  they know they know people know when they look up and they see something going towards it up in the  air you know we're not that stupid that we don't recognize something going from the ground up i also  can't fathom that uh you get an explosion supposedly uh over the wing tanks of the center tanks uh it it 
[01:14:00]  rips the front of the plane off how does this now tube at a tremendous speed and planes are very frail  we look at them like oh that's a strong you know you need the lightweight it they're pretty frail when  they're not put together the the wind just going inside that tube it seems to me would blow it apart  immediately right like how is a plane flying uh like you said uh i'm climbing uh aerodynamically the  plane is now shot there's no way this thing is is going to be climbing nothing makes sense off of 
[01:14:30]  their uh the official uh explanation nothing yeah you see because now you've been forced with this  don't just stop and think about it right right now you're just not being told by somebody who has a  big title or who is an authority who's telling you it's this and so you say oh yeah well you're the  authority i'm going to say so we got to believe him right yeah yeah you don't you the thing is it's 
[01:15:00]  you have to weigh out what's more harmful to my my my comfort level here that that something  happened to this plane or that my government is lying to me so you almost want to believe  the the wing tank story and the the short circuit from some unknown reason this thing ignited it's  easier to believe it's it's it's easy it's more comfortable to believe more comfortable sure  that yeah well you could sleep at night with that then oh my god these that's a biggie lie right 
[01:15:30]  there right what else are they lying about witnesses i mean really are traumatized by your experience that  they had coming forward yeah you know and uh i mean literally you saw lisa perry she she just started  she burst into tears when she started talking i like the fact though that you don't do too much  speculation about the whys because you're right because then you get caught in this whole thing  and you're admitting you don't know it no no but i purely again as a guess it's not too crazy that  in 96 we had the 93 trade center bombing and maybe they were afraid that if word got out that this was 
[01:16:00]  an attack with a shoulder launch missile it would destroy the airline industry and that it's easier  because then you're like why would twa sign on for this or why why would uh boeing or whoever it  was allow this theory to go forward because it hurts their company but the end game might have been  that it does more damage to the airline industry thinking of a shoulder-length uh large missile  attack than a freak accident which happened once in 30 years but who wouldn't want to do that again 
[01:16:30]  then if you're if you're a terrorist group right and it worked wouldn't you just do it again especially  if you know that the victim kind of tried to cover it up yeah of course the the other troubling aspect  about that though is that you know not going not speculating about who or whatever is the undermining  of of of the investigation while it was underway i mean the guys uh the investigators who you know the  guys in our film who handled the wreckage them talking about the fbi coming in there and altering 
[01:17:00]  everything hammering on it at night uh not letting them uh do their do their work or photograph everything  so there there was an undermining a consistent undermining i mean david mayer who's number two  at the ntsb right now he was one of the major culprits in this thing i mean this is a guy who  changed evidence tags so things would look like they fell in other uh other areas so that it would 
[01:17:30]  fly it would it would fit better with the official theory and by the way people forget well and then of  course he uh he distorted the eyewitness accounts to to discredit them and this guy's still there at  the ntsb you know he's he's he was promoted and as a matter of fact we just heard something rather  troubling that that our petition was sent uh to his office oh boy that's great you know uh well we're  not going to believe me if this petition is not taken seriously we will take other no i don't doubt it 
[01:18:00]  you two are nudges you just don't give up do you know who in your documentary can you can you talk  about just the position some of the people who now are in your documentary had because you do another  impressive part of it was that you have people that i wouldn't typically associate with again  conspiracy exactly people that were actively involved with the investigation who legitimately  know what they're talking about well i think you know hank hughes now he's the furthest from 
[01:18:30]  conspiracy theory he's he's a right-wing guy he's you know has guns you know he's he's a former cop  you know we've been to his house uh this guy is his straight shooter and you know what exactly what  was his position he was the guy who reconstructed the the interior of the whole aircraft senior accident  investigator one of the most one of the most decorated guys at the ntsb he was one of the top  five investigators that they had at the time he was one of only five at the ntsb who were 
[01:19:00]  multi-modal accident investigators meaning they could investigate any kind of i mean this guy  is an a a true expert and and by the way ironically uh the ntsb gave him the outstanding performance  award upon his retirement for twa wow did you guys get to see the plane in the hangar yes that's amazing  they put that whole thing back together and i just can't of it well most of it is a big chunk  no no no it's pretty big no it's a big chunk it's a big chunk it's a big chunk behind the 
[01:19:30]  wings to the front of the way when you think of where it was it's amazing they got any of it  it's pretty amazing yes yes yes um hey what kind of criticism are you guys getting from this documentary  they're there can you get into that a little bit they're trying to assassinate our character they're  calling they're calling hank a uh a uh they just put him on the accident because he's a bus accident  investigator and they're short-handed which is a lot oh this guy was decorated he all the 90s he  investigated almost every air class you're a moron huh you're a moron i'm a wingnut i'm an idiot 
[01:20:00]  and i'm an armchair physicist armchair physicist i sit in my armchair that's pretty nice yeah talk about  physics yeah that's a geeky little title yeah well i am a physicist yeah they want you to go away  out they do yeah what's the chem what's the chemical on the wing that that became an issue  and they sent a piece to nasa p-e-t-o on the wing okay that was um that was a splatter pattern yeah  and it we did that wasn't on the wing though oh the center wing tank it also on some of the seats 
[01:20:30]  you know splattered and it proved that it was splattered before the tank exploded which alone  refutes their theory but it was sent to nasa to test a positive for nitrates and nitrates could be  from urine it could be from explosive they didn't check to see which one it came from and that's  what we say in the documentary i interviewed the guy who who didn't do the testing i said why didn't  you do the testing and he got real uncomfortable said well i don't know why oh god tell them tell  them what he said to you on the phone though oh yeah way before that well about a different 
[01:21:00]  investigation he did on some other pieces i said come on why don't you do this test you should have  done this test he said well if i did that test what if i came out differently than i wanted well  well then i couldn't put the thing to bed and i said yes and i just went silent i said you tape  these conversations you should have something on your phone that tapes all conversations i i i  cannot answer that question okay i would hope so it's uh that that splatter pattern thing was  really interesting because regardless of even what it was the fact that it would have had to have uh 
[01:21:30]  exploded uh fragment the wing the wing tank fragment and then coincidentally that's  splatter would have had to apply itself to all the separate pieces where then if it's reassembled  it amazingly looked like one splatter or you could just determine that it was splattered on before  the pieces came apart so when when you think that it it refutes the entire thing where did that come  from it was it was post event obviously that's splatter pre-event uh pre-event yeah sorry pre-event 
[01:22:00]  and uh there's just no explanation there isn't and we have a report saying that most likely  scenarios this happened before the tank blew up we have the documentation sure yeah so it's their  own documentation yeah ntsp yeah which means it's something that there's that you're saying probably  the original one blew up outside the aircraft exactly and then uh some other event happened  later when maybe the explosion of center wing tank happened later on right right uh later on you 
[01:22:30]  mean like right after that like could have been four seconds okay yeah yeah now the but the bodies  there was an interesting piece about the bodies and the condition some of the bodies were in uh  people that were kind of seated next to each other or if it was a center fuel tank explosion all of the  bodies in this area should have looked like this there would have been a pattern right and uh and they  did not it was it was a random pattern throughout the aircraft you had someone you know destroyed here  a person next to him you know perfectly fine what the medical examiner suggested to us when we interviewed 
[01:23:00]  them was they were they what they say is they left their seats before the fire hit the aircraft  which means some force possibly could have blown them out of them out of their it's getting you  don't want right right you know now it's speculation well i just didn't want to upset the family members  here by right right yeah yeah yeah yeah uh but but uh an air crash and and the the injuries and stuff  does seem pretty random when there is like wow i was sitting right there the person next to me  well well got killed you need to explain it like well if you have a detonation of a warhead 
[01:23:30]  a significant distance from the aircraft right that itself is a somewhat random event because  you never know how those explosives are going to detonate with the air and everything so you can  have forces come up you know jets of hot gases in different directions and hitting over here and  then another jet hitting over here and that's actually that's why that's what the evidence shows  okay you you have to understand if you were to go with the with the ntsv center wing fuel tank 
[01:24:00]  that's a deflagration that's a little explosion comparatively speaking a small explosion that goes  like this yeah yeah she made like a mushroom cloud almost it's like a slow burn too it's not so and  they admit that a low velocity explosion yeah low velocity right so so you would expect to see  the the people who are near that area to be you know burned and whatever and then it gets less and  less as it goes back as it goes back right okay that was not the pattern it wasn't it was random  throughout the aircraft okay left to right front to back random yeah which meant it was something 
[01:24:30]  that didn't explode evenly in the middle yeah probably nothing that exploded on not a contact  fuse missile not a bomb on the aircraft not a center wing tank but a different type of missile  that are designed to explode at distance from the aircraft yeah yeah so it has a better chance  of hitting it you know you explode here and you can hit a target if you're off the course a bit  yeah yeah it just throws a bunch of garbage what a horrifying death for those people  oh yeah who lived through the initial explosion right and now didn't they list this always drove 
[01:25:00]  me crazy one they didn't they list drowning as the cause of death for someone one for one  only was it only one person oh i thought it was all and who who survives the impact and then drowns it  it doesn't make sense they don't think that the person was conscious yeah yeah yeah you're  unconscious but you're alive right technically you're alive yeah yeah yeah to be able to fight  for your life but only one yeah oh no that was all okay oh yeah there were some really uh very very  strange things that happened um there was this we didn't put this in the film it's called interbody 
[01:25:30]  implosion but uh these two bodies came in um within uh two weeks apart and they both tested for the  same dna as if they were twins but they weren't they were twins but they weren't it was two separate  people and for some reason the the the force of the explosion in their area was so strong that  literally their flesh kind of oh wow together holy they'd never even seen this before i mean they 
[01:26:00]  we have we have the video of the uh the dna guy talking about it and he said it was very strange  what's the the most evidence there is that there was some type of exercise going on uh like what do  they what do they say it's just circumstantial evidence we have the ca documents saying you know  hey let's get this information from from the military because of the exercise that we heard was going on at  the time so that's from the cia so that's what they say there was something going on at the time 
[01:26:30]  i got documents from from the air force saying that there was they sent down some jets that day  to that area um but again this is all circumstantial we don't have any evidence that they launched a  missile the fbi says that they interviewed the navy no missiles were missing so we have no evidence  to prove that yes this was a friendly fire accident so until we do we can't say that we believe that  exactly yeah yeah i almost think a friendly fire accident they would admit i really i i think it  was something a bit more devious because i don't see why they wouldn't just own up to it like hey we 
[01:27:00]  screwed i mean maybe maybe man that's tough that is a bad one i don't know you're talking about a  lot of people's reputations well they don't want to put themselves out there like that careers right  well the other thing too is you know flying missiles off of very heavily populated yeah yeah who authorize  it yeah yeah who would authorize that i mean for the flying public that would create quite a high  pucker factor if there was a deep awareness of this not like there's a lot of airports major airports 
[01:27:30]  in this area oh no there are oh literal jimmy do you guys do you guys got uh questions on other events  that happened like other other things that are make you suspicious there are but nothing you've heard  of i mean the whole 9 11 thing i don't i'm with you yeah yeah i hated that loose change oh you know  we should ask you that okay he's that question what do you think happened on uh 9 11 exactly what  was shown exactly what was shown people hate us and they decided to do this now there are a lot of 
[01:28:00]  people that might be listening that go i can't believe that i think that i've had arguments with  people i respect a great deal right right yeah absolutely whatever but uh you know i think i think  you can only take one of these big stories at a time right right look at us i mean we were much  younger when we started when did you start this well i mean i was assigned at cbs i was assigned uh  you know she's an emmy award-winning producer of cbs news yeah you know well they haven't taken it away  she was but how many years have you been working on this documentary two and a half yeah it took us two 
[01:28:30]  and a half years to do the doc wow it started in 1997 when i saw that cia animation i said what the heck  what is that it took 15 years to to get here though wow you know is there a piece of i'm sorry  is there a piece that you're right now fighting for in court is there a couple a set of documents  right now that you really really want that have been particularly hard to get because i'm always  amazed they don't just throw the documents out like like why would you save that so like why not  just put it in the paper shredder but they for some reason are you giving them ideas yeah right 
[01:29:00]  it's amazing you gotta assume they do you know shred stuff those videos disappeared for sure uh  yeah yeah yeah but there are you know there are some documents they keep and i'm suspicious that  the guy that uh shot that just doesn't have a video or wasn't willing to come forward more  i know you talked to you said you talked to him and he was kind of like spoke to his wife at her  work that's the only number i got and she said why are you calling me yeah yeah she got upset they  just don't want to deal with this at all yeah you know he wouldn't i i would not be surprised if  the fbi intimidated them just like they intimidated the eyewitnesses you think that really 
[01:29:30]  happens let's not speculate about that but what do you think it really happened well i wouldn't  be surprised you know because they intimidated they intimidated our investigators they intimidated the  eyewitnesses how do they intimidate because there's always this thing where i did this didn't  you see no no but i mean i'm saying to explain to the audience because they're sure it's not  like the fbi has a meeting it says okay we have to intimidate the lady in 15b like there's never  that discussion so it's hard to prove because it's this it's it's this thing that that so how 
[01:30:00]  would you say that they well why they intimidated i don't know but we know that they did but how do  they do the black vans show up and they throw you in and this woman was uh trying to get citizenship  this woman was trying to get her citizenship and they knew that before they interviewed her at the  end of the interview they said hey you're trying to become a citizen aren't you said yes i'm waiting  to be called very innocent lady so well if you want to become a citizen you might want to keep  quiet about what you saw that's what they said to her and she's for that it's like you're going to  be like yeah because i better keep quiet and it worked and she never spoke yeah this was the first 
[01:30:30]  time that she had come forward yeah yeah she's now a citizen yeah yeah so she was able to yeah yeah  and other other people were like you know one of the guy was berated he's like you saw nothing  you saw nothing and he's just sitting there and he says i saw nothing yeah but he says that in our  documentary control yeah it's mind control did it have anything to do with the harp system  i'm a fighter a gex governor a navy seal i believe it was ufos that took down flight 800 
[01:31:00]  and i'll prove it with my team this horrible team of ex-wrestlers  jesus uh jesse's doors you can have a second career oh well that's the first career that's  pretty much it what you see is what you get yes this is yes i i really bells and whistles thoroughly  enjoyed it um and uh i think anybody going into watching this documentary uh with any skepticism 
[01:31:30]  is really going to have a lot to to think about and and like what you were saying that the fact that  that what you guys present in the documentary is amazing but it also opens up so many doors where  you once you're done with watching the movie i got right on the computer and i just start clicking  away trying to find other things it it opens up a lot of questions uh and you know you do your own  little investigations use your own common sense even and uh you really do come to some frightening 
[01:32:00]  conclusions then the new york times made a comment in their review uh yesterday that that you know  raises the a troubling question and i thought it was very uh interesting that that this guy mentioned  it you know because we are submitting the petition to reopen the investigation to the same um institution  that uh ran the horror show previously you know and he wasn't convinced that they're going to actually  look at this honestly yeah why would they it refutes what they but it is our only legal recourse at 
[01:32:30]  this point so we just had to at least follow that process yeah well i mean let me say when it's on  too so people can watch it it's on uh it's on tonight at eight o'clock and it's on epics and that's the  only reason i watched it was because epics uh sent it to me and uh i like those guys like oh i normally  wouldn't even watch it because i'm like i'm so anti-conspiracy and i was like jesus christ like it really yeah  people have to understand it's not a a wacky conspiracy not at all movie this thing is so well 
[01:33:00]  done and and the the people you speak to are real people they're they're uh uh connected directly to  the investigation not a friend of some guy that knew some guy no directly witnesses that saw this  there's not one fat guy with a bullhorn in the entire investigation  but that's what to me made it very credible they're real citizens and then some of the people that you 
[01:33:30]  have speaking on your behalf or on your on your side of the issue who know what they're talking about  legitimately know what they're talking about again loose change got so many they grab so many random  people that they put a title on and an early news report which who gives a because the news gets  things wrong yeah you're talking to people that actually were involved with the investigation  that's right that's right yeah so uh i recommend it highly that's great tonight 8 p.m on epics and  epics i'm sure will rerun it but today is the uh the anniversary yeah right um epics is epix by the 
[01:34:00]  way you can go to there if you don't get them on your system on your cable system you can go to epics  hd epixhd.com oh is it on there too sign up yeah sign up for a free two-week uh free trial oh nice  yeah and you can see the documentary nice great that's a great way to screw epics too  just sign up for the free trial uh you have no intention of getting it and watch this for free  and after you see our movie yeah whatever we don't care what you do with epics  go screw right we don't care we don't give a hoot yeah so epicshd.com or on epics tonight but 
[01:34:30]  it's really really well done i hope we did it justice because anthony and i again uh not conspiracy  guys opi definitely not a conspiracy guy and uh all of us are like jesus christ this really made  you think it makes sense way more than i thought it would you don't have to go you don't have to go  way beyond your uh imagination or or common sense when you watch this to to believe it it's uh it's  right there it's right there i appreciate it thanks guys thank you very much thank you thanks 
[01:35:00]  moving right along how was the all-star game last night i i didn't watch i didn't either i just  find it dull there were a couple of uh i just don't like exciting parts but i don't like baseball 
[01:35:30]  anymore no wow i just don't like it i guess there was a big moment with uh rivera though right yeah  that was cool yeah i guess it's his last all-star game so he's returning quite the ovation and they  didn't need to bring him in the game so there's a little controversy why is there why is it controversy  they they they played a pickup game last night controversy yeah it's an all-star game like well  they thought he should be the like closer yeah but there's no reason to use him as a closer so 
[01:36:00]  they said fuck it let's bring him in and uh let him pitch the eighth inning well yeah like jim leland  had a good reason why because he guaranteed he said i guarantee rivera's going to pitch his worry was  that the national league would come back they win and then you don't have to come there's no bottom  of the ninth no bottom and then rivera doesn't get to pitch right you know so he's like i'm going to  put him in the eighth all right he's guaranteed to pitch all right so there you go but who's  objecting people that don't think about it logically and say okay there was a chance it's  an all-star game you want him to come out yeah like obviously you would like for him to save the 
[01:36:30]  game but there's a chance that he might not be able to and you want and you'd rather get him in the  game and yeah and they still do the whole field advantage to the team that wins that is the dumbest  fucking sports though no but but this player is playing that know already that they don't even have  a fucking shot and making it to the world series so why would they fucking care it is the dumbest  thing they've ever come up with in sports i think they're not diving for a catch at that no no one 
[01:37:00]  wants to get hurt you're not even no you're protecting your your players they're protecting  themselves out there it's that i don't understand why that uh went through cano got hit in the first  cano got nailed yeah why why did they do that should have rushed them out he should have big  fucking a big brawl where like only your teammates come out of the dugout everyone else is just  sitting there i don't know i don't care it's just cano and mariano yeah yeah that's it what the  matt harvey and you can't have a bench clear at the all-star game because no one gives a 
[01:37:30]  shit about you but why did they do that they said to make the all-star game more interesting yeah  so how about you fucking put some money on it or something i don't necessarily agree but to play  the game for home field advantage i think the team for the world series of home field advantage  of course yes it's the stupidest thing they ever came they want to make it count anyway good game  that wasn't the big news at the all-star game uh rivera no it was the five orioles that were no no  that wasn't it either travis it was the uh reals and i say this uh gonna take that hat off 
[01:38:00]  we had a dope  that ran on the field last night i like this dope yeah so i don't want to confuse the audience i'm  calling them a dope they call them a jerk a jerk yeah they're calling them the city tweet jerk what a  jerk i like this jerk you like this i like this jerk a lot we're watching the video where is it on 
[01:38:30]  deadspin we'll put it on our facebook page back that shit up but the story behind the guy running  on the field is terrific it's absolutely terrific there he is look at him slammed what's great about  it is that he stops running and he puts his hands up like i'm i'm not gonna run away from you guys  body slammed he still gets body slammed they have to make an example they just don't want people doing 
[01:39:00]  this dude in the old days he'd have been shaking those guys hand they'd put their arm around and  they'd walk off the field and he'd have been waving right now it's like he fucking like like he had a  bazooka with him and now he gets speared like goldberg he got fucking that guy picked him up  and threw him down and all that guy i say look we didn't know it was a tur it might have been a  terrorist threat terrorist we can't fucking assume this is okay anyway uh city tweet jerk runs on field his 
[01:39:30]  name is dylan massonia it looks like he's under arrest he's probably in jail somewhere but how this  came about is just terrific he's he loves twitter a twitter loving twit ran on the oh they had to  write that a twitter loving twit ran on the field at the all-star game at city field last night after  saying he would do so if 1 000 people retweeted his message and an online mob egged him on how many 
[01:40:00]  followers did he have before this i don't know how many he had before but now he's got about 5 500  all right so he got he probably got a lot of those last night yeah well he got over 3 000 retweets  right so he goes hey man i'm sitting here at the all-star game and if a thousand people retweet this  i'm running on the field so of course people gonna jump on that one man uh dylan he's 18 posted on  twitter at about 8 pm okay a thousand rts and i'll run across the field after getting the thousandth  retweet in which uh twitter users repeat his message but sony ran onto the field in the fifth 
[01:40:30]  inning lmao this is going to be terrible he tweeted before he was tackled by security  it's gonna be terrible who's mad at this stuff come on who's outraged nobody no one reverend out  i am outraged so he's outraged before the stunt the teen sent out a picture of a text from his  mother and now his mom is reading his twitter going holy what are you doing and so he sent out  a picture of the text conversation the mom said it's not funny that's a serious thing and you could 
[01:41:00]  get arrested if not worse please don't be ridiculous oh boy and then missoni all right  missoni later tweeted pray for me because my mom's gonna kill me  his dumb kid is what he is he rolls right dope he'll be charged with interfering with a professional  sporting event uh doesn't even sound real well they don't really there's not a real huge charge 
[01:41:30]  there what they do is they throw you in jail for a day maybe a day tops and and then you're banned from  city field i don't know how do they know that's i've always wondered that facial recognition stuff  at the gate right just grow mustache he's great because he went through with it like he said i'm  gonna do this i know that is and he did it that's why i love this jerk because when you're sitting  there especially if you got the good seats and he didn't even have good seats not oh yeah to walk  down you could just sit there and don't you look and go like i could jump right down there and  just run around like an idiot we've had this conversation happened get fucking body slam we were in

[01:42:30]  but i think a lot of us think this shit right yeah you're like oh fuck you think those weird  things i could i could i think i can make it to the stage you don't do them but you think them yeah  right yeah am i the only one i want to tackle travis  but i remember having an inner dialogue with myself i'm like just do it just go and tackle bill  maher and see what happens yeah this kid did it though he had that same feeling and he said

[01:45:00]  you today no i did not yes you did how was the all-star game sir i wasn't even at the game i  stood at mcpett's next door thank you for your time that should be the entire call  bar next door to the ballpark all right oh you got close though by there  why would you go by there if you didn't have a ticket why would you just stay home 
[01:45:30]  no i was supposed i was supposed to i was holding a table for a few friends of mine  answer the question if you didn't get a ticket to the all-star game unfortunately because i know  how badly you wanted to go why didn't you just stay home no i just thought it would be just to be  close to it close to it who does that doesn't deal with the traffic yeah yeah you're now in all-star  fucking traffic to see it on tv well he takes bubble do you take the bus or do you think what do you do

[02:12:00]  i know right it's such a pleasure and you're and you're a real friend i actually am we hung out we  did the tour the virus tour we like each other we even went to dinner when i had  we have gone to dinner mr saget i had a woman at the time i'm not gonna lie to you i brag about  that one i liked that we were on a patio of a restaurant it was nice it was nice we both had  consensual people yeah they didn't say no no yellow tape over their mouths or orifices that's  one i do brag about yeah who i went to dinner with once we can go again i've never had dinner with bob 
[02:12:30]  bob's awesome we love but you did that's our famous story is you were asking me one night  jim helping hand yeah you know what i'm talking about i need a hand job but you know what i'm  talking about you know you know i'm saying it and then i went this is saget oh dude i thought  you were a hooker yeah coming over i sent him the wrong text oh really yeah yeah yeah it was to  a girl who used to jerk me off for money and i sent it to bob by mistake we were like so good to see  him here i was like let's talk to each other so i was right up next to hooker jerk off 
[02:13:00]  and then uh we saw each other in montreal because i hosted this thing jim kicked ass at  this comedy festival thing there's a live thing up there live thing and then my intro was i told  that story my intro to jim was i got to say that he thought i was a hooker that was going to jerk  him off and now here he is and then i wouldn't shake his hand i was scared the one thing about going  to dinner with bob saget and especially eating outside while people are walking by you realize how  fucking famous bob saget is he's not going to say anything to that comment but you are ridiculous 
[02:13:30]  you are so recognizable like big bird might get a combination of anthony wiener and big  bird it doesn't help that you're that you're as tall as you are right because you can't just  exhausting like melt into a crowd i can't wait till i get a disease it gives me a real bad humpback  i'll just crone over and people do you like it i like other times you don't like it i guess is the  real question the truth of it is i was talking to somebody about this i i actually wake up pretty  happy in the morning i'm not a negative person it takes the day to kind of beat me down it takes to 
[02:14:00]  find out oh that happened or just turn on the news or find out that that person doesn't want to talk  to me that girl's not interested or or my mom won't you know have sex with me again what hello  do you have a seven second delay i never had sex with my mom we don't need that here i'm just saying  guys i never had sex with my mom fair enough we all have yeah that's why we're not that number  machine from the deli was in your bedroom so yeah i'm pretty nice to people normally when they come 
[02:14:30]  up i i like it but it's a it's weird because the guy will come over here's my daughter and and i think  he's like giving her to me you know like a sultan and he's like no she loves you on on that full house  we watch it all the time you were just saying it oh yeah i said that i i see you every night  because they switch from cartoons to full house when i'm trying to put my kid to bed so then i'm  like oh yeah i gotta go on demand and get a a show for him but i'm trying to get him into full house  i'm like check this shit out i don't even i don't i don't remember a lot of it i mean they put me in  like a barney suit they would put me in the you know i had a cardigan sweater i can't the wardrobe 
[02:15:00]  alone i don't i don't yeah yeah yeah my cells rejected it you were the perpetual goody guy i was a  hugger and i was it was patterned by the guys the guys that produced it are really good guys it was  jeff franklin and miller boyette who did happy days of the vernon shirley so i was opie i was richie  cunningham uh-huh camos was fonzie right and uh dave coulier was potty or ralph mouth i don't know  combo combo yeah yeah exactly i guess uh the michelle character i don't know what tom bosley do you sit 
[02:15:30]  down and watch the show ever no only when i'm masturbating or have diarrhea hopefully at the  same time i love masturbating with oh there's a little sweater oh my god it's that that picture  is that point of that picture travel well you know what show 87 to 95 i think something like that  eight years you would have been great on that show jim i think so i wish you would have been on it  yeah i would have been so i mean it was really fun having john and dave there i've actually 
[02:16:00]  obviously been friends with them a long time so we did a lot of  fucked up stuff i'm writing a book that comes out next year and i'm talking about stuff i probably  shouldn't talk about that we did oh but that's what people want to read that is and it's not like  we did anything bad it was just like oh the whipped cream cans were for the birthday cake but there  was still some residue of the fumes in them sure so let's go in the prop room you know before the  birthday scene yeah nothing special nothing bad not like we killed an animal or right no roofies to  the twins no didn't no didn't have don't bring up the twins he's very protective i think we learned 
[02:16:30]  that last time we were feeling him out and he's like and my own kids yeah yeah you know you don't  do your kids on here right no no they're civilians how old are they how old are they now the awesome  twins yeah 27 because my oldest daughter is 26. that's hilarious they're 54. yes i just do math so  credit is amazing it feels like yesterday we had the countdown i was just thinking yeah yeah yeah  they knew about the countdown when they were everybody yeah everyone knew about the countdown 
[02:17:00]  they're fairly savvy you know they're like yeah when's that countdown over  counting down to when they were legal what's wrong with that bob saggin i'm fly  now they're 27. i can't believe i just walk around this building what's in these halls  that you know trainees are younger than interns now there's two levels now that get you to the  point where you're a problem for the guy that works there yeah have you seen our interns there's one  right there that you seem very attractive lovely sydney yeah just walking down the hall clearing a lovely 
[02:17:30]  little uh sundress sundress sundress any restraining orders a little sundress no i actually invited him  over my house for a party uh at the beginning of the summer they came to the party it was a lot of fun  but um you know this area crime scene tape around there no there's nothing going on you don't get  do you have any uh well you got all those robots and stuff yeah yeah all kinds of cool  we were just talking about old shows with the interns do you guys remember full house did you watch full 
[02:18:00]  house huh so you know bob yeah are you starstruck today people that i think it's more creeped i think  people are more creeped now oh my god they're more creeped yeah right because it's like well he doesn't  seem like the guy that was the dad yeah it's like the guy that was the dad and all sweet uh  is just like talking kind of weird and yeah yeah what happened to him you know he sounds he sounds  bitter sounds more like i don't know lou rawls when he talks you'll never find so you watched uh you  girls watched uh full house yeah i enjoyed more the your comedy central roast though recently i did i love 
[02:18:30]  that okay that's nice that was my friends wow it's the only roast i've ever done on comedy  central thanks to bob i wanted you i was always i got it one of the few people that got to actually  have my friends i mean actually were my friends it was normally yeah i guess you don't want to  brag every all these people yeah gilbert i saw gilbert last night he makes me laugh so hard yeah  and uh they're doing um who are they doing this year james franco that's a cool idea oh it is and i'm 
[02:19:00]  i'm here that they're just going to maybe have his friends which means it might be a smarter roast  oh that'll probably be crazy yeah well seth rowan will be there then wow sydney's got a beautiful  uh little sundress on today yeah it is a lot of what happens is there anything legal that you can  do any kind of action against them just for liking your i know right yeah yeah there would be something  in some office where i'd be like that's a lovely dress we're kind of safe and then the mikes are  char would come in and the mics are the only deterrent yeah if we commented on her dress that 
[02:19:30]  means if we said the same thing with the mics off we'd have a problem i see yeah i do have the  forever 21 site up on your computer yes forever 21 he's trying to figure out what different looks  would look yes of course i love that you know that we should have dressed we should have dressed the  intern day i've been in a lot of forever 21 his favorite store is 10 years till they're 21  at your house do you have like color forms of all the girls that work here you have to you have  to be rainy today let me put the umbrella legos color forms right yeah yeah a lot of toys and has 
[02:20:00]  a couple stories you know stories all legal legal stories you know girls go into forever 21 that aren't  21 but you can't you can't go that far over 21 you could you could probably get to 24 and still go there  yeah but you're talking about the girls that went there with you that were 18. 40 year old women  shopping forever 21 they're just small people they're midgets do you see people in there where 
[02:20:30]  you're just like oh boy what are you doing oh yeah yeah you feel a little bad do you say something to  them oh no people do what they want to do i mean i'm sure i look like an idiot sometimes when no one  says anything to me i don't think so sometimes they do they shush you that's true and i shush them  back right yeah that's that attitude that attitude listen to this show all day long so that every  day when they do it you listen to every single thing that happens yeah so nothing shocks you guys  not really anymore no i think sydney's probably more shockable than than jackie is i don't know about 
[02:21:00]  that yeah i don't know no way yeah she's just she seems more mild-mannered she's more quiet but no  way there's nah well what do you know i can read people what i've always been able to read people  you're not shocked right what's that mean what is i got away from the dress maybe the eyes are you ever  shocked sydney sorry are you shocked by what you hear on the show no yeah you're embarrassed if it's 
[02:21:30]  directed at you like this question is probably more shocking than anything bob she walks from penn  station to here in the basically in the middle of the night by herself yeah it's a bad thing to say  on the air probably is right no no she brought it to our attention on the air and then we kind of  you know made sure you know it's being done properly gps device put in yourself she's she's got  balls man all right oh that's what's different about her oh to those guys yeah i'd be i'd be working 
[02:22:00]  at penn station too if i had balls and a dress see i would think you were the more mild-mannered  one jackie was a little more wild yeah or something which one's mary kate which one's ashley which one  let's see i still can't tell the difference between them to be quite honest yeah yeah yeah  i mean i had all their movies yeah oh you did their movies yeah like i had every single one of their  movies oh you did so disturbing to me are they really sweet people dollar empire i mean i don't  know why didn't you get a taste of that bob i know you're well that sounds wrong on every level 
[02:22:30]  you can always tell twins apart you just mark one with a sharpie  that was always that's all but that's that's a billion dollar uh empire that thing is picked up  for another i don't own that show none of us do the people that own it are having a very nice time  because syndication doesn't exist like that much anymore and that thing's going to be on for another  six years which means for me they're just it's a breeding farm for my future audiences you know  yeah yeah a little place where you'd have like you grow salmon or something you know or sea monkeys 
[02:23:00]  or something and eventually it'll become life did you ever get syndication money from that you get  no no nobody else if you you have money but you don't own it you got right right most people don't  own their shows like all the residuals and stuff friends and seinfeld except for jerry and  lair everybody knows all that stuff yeah yeah yeah not everybody but it's but you got like you  got residuals yeah you could buy dresses for her for all eternity wow so wait wait wait i want to  get into this for a second because uh but shows before you really got screwed yeah you didn't get 
[02:23:30]  screwed as bad as well if you got a high paying fee you're doing pretty well if you save your money  if you didn't go spend it all and do something but i mean the residuals and and the syndication  money like the brady bunch didn't get any of that no residual if you're the partridge family and you  actually are ending up living on the bus that you traveled on yeah so you don't think you have  to be like only so uh michael richards and jason alexander they made a very handsome salary but  they didn't get the syndication money they got syndication money through the you know the screen 
[02:24:00]  actors guild that's how everybody always people say that they always go hey that that that residuals  residuals usually sounds just like drainage it comes yeah it's residue yeah it's what's left  your diaper's not working when everything else is gone after everyone else took their taste  took theirs it's the residue that's left seepage you get a little seepage from full house get  leakage from you get some leaky moldy stuff everywhere you look is the theme song everywhere you look  there's seepage who owned it uh miller boyette tom uh miller and bob boyette and uh jeff franklin 
[02:24:30]  and then but at warner brothers okay big one actually the person that started me up and hired me  i saw the other night les moonvest who runs cbs oh we know less and he uh got a few meetings with  him over he's a nice man he's one of the nicer ones that he will say no to you if he doesn't want  to do something he'll say no no i i saw him in a bathrobe at a spa with his uh you know how much you  know how many years you could have been on the air taking that opportunity but it was awkward we're in 
[02:25:00]  the we're in this room waiting for massage massagers and you had to pretend you weren't waiting  he's he's in a he's in a gay bathrobe i'm in a gay bathrobe you mean they're on backwards  now that doesn't make much sense someone's has got to be on forwards  and then we had an awkward conversation we were we were doing radio for the guy at the time and then  i see him in the one restaurant you could go to uh if you go to this particular spa he didn't pick up 
[02:25:30]  dinner i'm like all right that means he's gonna get rid of us really he didn't pick up dinner nope  i didn't eat with him but i'm just saying did you think you should have gotten you thinking about  it was like you should have gotten your spa bill as well yes he's worth a few shekels  why not anybody with a lot of money anywhere and he's in your perimeter all right how about  this for you how about send a drink over bob saget or a bottle of wine okay i sent things over  he was probably saying this old piece of didn't pay my bill  oh man i'll never forget we were just sitting there in bathrobes like he is a very powerful 
[02:26:00]  man where was it ah spa up in connecticut i've been there oh that's right it's a nice little  place you've been to that place yeah burfew grows up oh this is really you want a massage don't you  you just grab the women you just grab do you do you guys want to stay here for this  let them leave for this yeah all right i apologize you're terrific to talk about  this without feeling guilty the ladies are terrific thank you they bring sunshine into  the studio don't drink and drive they bring sunshine and it bothers them to give you a head in the spa

[02:33:00]  they fucking they're glowing well and that's why they got into that field they look at if you look at  pictures of them which i know we all do all night long they're staring at that lens because they  all know you make love to the back of the lens yeah yeah look at the lens you are the lens be the lens  i've never had a woman look at me the way they look at a lens at a lens yeah i want to be a lens  i've had a woman look at me the way they look at the scope of a rifle though  just total fear yeah it's just revulsion or was it was it a woman welcoming jimmy wants to just do 
[02:33:30]  lunch with a lady that's all he's looking for that's nice a little one yeah i've been on a really  bad streak you've been in a bad streak like you haven't been uh having uh relations with anybody  nothing nothing i've been i'm the mayor of dud city so you're just like a porn you just stay on  porn all night long i haven't been as bad with the porn a little bit i'm struggling with it but i'm  trying to lay off so you've been a little have you just been less sexual in general you're just being  are you are doing more stand-up are you racking at something or um well acting something no uh much much 
[02:34:00]  um mushrooms it off no uh stand up yes right um but it's just too it everything focuses on that  when you're doing that it's hard to write it's hard to write you know and he's going to the gym bob sagat  you didn't even notice that he lost a lot of weight you look you look really good i i wanted to hear  that not that he's sick okay you weren't sure you weren't sure are you pregnant or did you just eat  a ham yeah yeah so very frightening no you look good thank you actually yeah i feel pretty good  so you're not you know but you're just not in that mode of the mojo's not flying right now 
[02:34:30]  oh not at all at all like terrible but lunch would be fun like you want to talk to them  you want to do that finally you get to know a woman i can uh meet a bunch of people i've literally  i asked one girl out to lunch through text and she just never responded and i'm like you  fucking twat i met twice i didn't i didn't ask you to go away no i should have angling i don't like  that construction cone but like i didn't ask you to go away for the weekend it's like you couldn't 
[02:35:00]  give me the courtesy of your response so it just makes me start to to hate people and it's like that's  why women wonder why we just this it just makes me go that's why i'm a piece of shit like that's  you're not no i mean sexually well you know a piece of shit sexually you're you're kind of a  sexaholic right so you love it i'm saying yeah but i mean that's why that's why women like that i  think they like to be fucked by a derrick or something no they don't care for that as much  not anymore what it's all changed i think young people probably want to be like if you're an alpha 
[02:35:30]  male maybe but women never look at me like oh god he finally fucked me like women finally just give  up and go right oh no but i'm not even saying they've never heard you like this i'm not even  being upset about it it's the truth but you used to be like i i mean not even long ago you'd be like  i gotta i gotta nail this man and then you just like go because women i've fucked i've always banged  hotter girls than i should and it's because there's something about my personality where when they get to  know me then they're kind of like yeah i'll fuck them like i'm not even pursuing them it's it's weird 
[02:36:00]  but i never have a woman just look at me and go like yeah i gotta ever i've never got laid that way i don't  know if that really happens a lot anyway well some guys do this i mean i could get laid a lot but i'm  scared of people because stuff i don't know how to get rid of them i don't know what to do i don't  know what i would do it's just weird yeah how do you how do you you know when do the relationships  end for you what's the end i kind of go into a dry spell for a long time yeah do nothing just alone 
[02:36:30]  yeah just i'm working real hard how long are you single uh five months okay that's that's the age of my  next wife right now i'm gonna find a good school for her putting in the time yeah i think montessori  would be good for the next person i'm gonna raise so what do you do you just start you just you just  watch porn or you don't do anything i haven't been doing too much i'll hit porn now and then if i'm in it  i stopped doing snuff because it ends badly yeah yeah it's gonna have the cast party before 
[02:37:00]  i like when it's potluck right i don't know what that means but i but i've just been working hard  and this week's like a hard week of stand-up like a fun one that i'm excited about what are you doing  yeah i should i'm here to i'm doing uh tons of gigs i'm doing the morristown new jersey the mayo  center tonight yep you know mike young mike i close that place for me what happened  iraq loves that place i'm gonna close it no iraq loves that place but the mayo center yeah no it 
[02:37:30]  just sounds like that because that is mayo is that what you're saying it's mayo oh yeah i get it now  oh there's not even a grin on his face you mean they're doing a condiment joke that's what you're  doing well like it was the mayonnaise the audience understands i understand we pick on iraq a little  yeah maybe a little too much so he loves it i got it yeah he's portly so it's playing the lard  university and the too fat to fuck uh yeah tonight's the mayo i'm on fallon tomorrow not the show 
[02:38:00]  oh just him just on him that's cool yeah i used to do a merv griffin show whenever you would go i'm on  the merv griffin show i'm on merv griffin not the show it actually applied yes it did yes well because  he was uh he was good to me what years did you do his show oh god said 82 to like i was on it 13  times really i was on carson 13 times i was about to ask you because i just saw a carson documentary  last night it's amazing yeah yeah what's your thoughts on carson i loved carson and he was uh 
[02:38:30]  you know it was a what did they show his personality in it that they yes yes kind of  that is they go into that bit of a quiet caramuchin yes yeah but it sounded like his fame pushed him  that way where he finally just kind of it did people and he's not the guy that's like hey hey hey good  to see everybody you know yeah yeah because he was a guy that used to be out and about when he was  younger yeah hollywood especially and then like uh the that fame just made him close down and kind 
[02:39:00]  of isolate himself but he was so good at that gig right oh my god and then by the end he had basically  no friends and even his wife he you know that he really loved the last one there he distances  but he lost his kid too so that was a terrible yeah he won i think he had said to uh to his wife or  wife-to-be at one point he said i don't want to do this these shows are all consuming to joanna yeah you  just yeah you he knew what it was to get into that show and if it was successful he knew that  would become his life period that's right and that's exactly what happened to the guy and he 
[02:39:30]  wanted it i mean he loved doing it i used to talk to him and he was really really kind to me i mean  i was talking to him that was someone that i idolized that i was god got over you talked to him  what backstage or yeah before the show what kind of conversations that's really interesting stuff um  um my one time it was uh i thought i was like bombing on the air and i said hey that wasn't  too good he goes oh you were good they were they were just they suck tonight and i went well what  do you what do you do and he goes well you just uh you got tomorrow night it's always tomorrow 
[02:40:00]  and then um he probably felt it in the monologue or something and knew that they just weren't a great  crowd yeah you could tell right away it was no different than what we do sure you just know  but um he was really kind to me it's funny i would tell stories that didn't stop you know i was like  the nephew that would come on and just tell stories you know so so i'm in there with my uh my kids and  he's like i said this is true he goes i don't care just tell it he would have said tell the 
[02:40:30]  fucking story and there was a music act i remember just sitting and talking to him i remember i have the  same memories kind of with letterman years later would do that show a lot also and and i'd known  david from the comedy store and stuff from years before but carson was that's an icon that i never  thought i'd ever be sitting and talking right like like that how did it feel to sit in that seat  what was funny was i i kind of knew ed kind of because he kind of knew my family in philly and the  first time i did it i believe it was the first time i did it was with gary shandling he was guest 
[02:41:00]  hosting and then i did it again with johnny and then i did it once with jay and then i did total  of 13 with johnny as i remember and then johnny was uh it was two weeks before he was going off the  air and i brought him a watch uh as a joke and it said 30 years of great service on it and i handed it  to him oh this is very nice thank you 30 years of great service and then i took out 16 more watches  identical watches like it was just a piece of and i gave one to ed and  that's funny he took me out to his car once and showed me his corvette 
[02:41:30]  yeah that's my it's my new car he just he didn't seem that happy but he no loved loved funny people  that's what it looked like and responded well because he knew that i loved him and i didn't  invade his privacy i was just i would just listen to him in the in the documentary they talk about 
[02:42:00]  how uh somebody had mentioned that watching someone be funny on the show it was great because you got  to see a funny person but it was also watching johnny legitimately laughing at it made it even better  and made it feel like like real you were in it you were there laughing with somebody that you cared  about and just a weird that whole time period and everything he was an institution man that that  just will never there wasn't never be replaced there wasn't that he was the guy yeah and they 
[02:42:30]  explain how arsenio hall bit off it a little bit took a little bit he did a pretty amazing thing  arsenio yeah arsenio was a real competitor there for a little bit but uh i wanted to talk about the  comedians again when he would call you over everyone talks about the comic being called right right in his  stand-up right who are the who are the sad saps that didn't get called over because now it's obvious  everyone knows about johnny calling the comedian over if you really liked them that's the whole big  thing i only did panel so i was really really lucky oh you never did stand up on the show they  wouldn't put me on the talent coordinator told me when i was trying to get on for like 10 years i 
[02:43:00]  couldn't get on when i finally had some television of consequence then i would come on as a guest just to  talk to him but they said my uh the the jim jim mccawley who passed away he was a nice man he was a  talent coordinator said your act is like a stone skipping on the water it doesn't quite dig in  i i want to do you got the rupert pumpkin speech from i can kung fu i don't need that i just want to  get on the night show he brought your cassette back to you and told you to go out and get some nightclub 
[02:43:30]  work and do some work and we'll send somebody out to see you as soon as we can send us the tape  yeah do you have a link i'll wait yeah but your comedy is also you know it's like edgier well it was  it was it when it was then it was uh just three associations so it didn't find it and it still  was edgy it was like my first joke was uh i have the brain of a german shepherd and the body of a  16 year old boy and they're both in my car and i want you to see them that was a joke that's not a  joke but you know just someone you say if you're fucked up right and people would laugh at it kind 
[02:44:00]  of because like what's wrong with this guy yeah but uh yeah i love the documentary then it got into  his relationship with his mom who oh man apparently she could have given him a little  more support just a little bit would have been nice she was uh yeah like just not he wanted her to be  proud of what he did and and anybody you'd think would be i mean what he achieved but even as a even  as he got older he just couldn't get her approval or she'd uh i guess she was watching the monologue 
[02:44:30]  with somebody that was writing a story about time magazine magazine somebody you know a little  publication yeah yeah time magazine and they're watching the monologue together the writer and  the mother and and done with the monologue and she goes yeah she said that wasn't funny that wasn't  funny and walked out of the room and walked out of the room and it wasn't even like a joke thing  where she comes back then it goes ah right and the writer's just oh my god you think she wanted to be  famous i don't know maybe frustrated by that she's just an obvious narcissist oh but but and not a 
[02:45:00]  person that understands anything i mean that's an ego battle well yeah yeah jealous that your kid  has a right right yeah yeah but it's more complicated than that we were discussing the documentary yesterday  thanks to anthony brought to my attention i went right home and got uh watched it uh when she died the  mom she had a box in the closet with all his all his press clippings she saved everything so she  so in a way johnny carson was like oh okay maybe she can express you know what she was feeling for  me in my breast but in the end she did show how proud she was because she saved it all and then 
[02:45:30]  uh they said johnny took that box put it in his closet and it remained there until you know he died  probably masturbated to it oh god what about what about uh his dad they didn't really go into the  dad that much they didn't there was a good role model positive guy yeah it was very simple stuff  they said something i'm sorry this footage of johnny from back in like the 40s and you know  the early 40s doing magic tricks around the house it's amazing that people had some of the footage 
[02:46:00]  was amazing well you watch him did they show the thing with sammy davis jr and frank and at uh in  st louis they did an amazing show and johnny was the emcee and he wasn't killing i mean he was doing  he was young he hadn't i might have just started to trust a game show and he was just a fresh  spry good-looking guy that was just like yeah they did yeah yeah he was kind of awkward yeah  the camera gangly and likable yeah yeah but you're very likable you wouldn't expect him to become what  he became yeah that intersection doesn't happen and where was he from uh nebraska because his father 
[02:46:30]  really wasn't in that a lot but they said something about like somebody from uh uh the dad that he was  he was the type of guy from nebraska that uh loved his family so much he almost told them  jay leno said it was the jay leno he was the one of his family so much he almost told he almost told  them that's a great lie he loved his wife so much he almost told them yeah yeah that was it  sad is that people don't right right i guess it's ethnicity too because some i mean jewish italian 
[02:47:00]  people maybe get a little more gregarious and how much it's a cultural thing but a person from the  midwest doesn't go around hugging their family no no that's what sets people off who are the guys  you came up with at the comedy store you mentioned letterman but who else was in your little group  like jimmy has his group yeah that comes in here and we're well we had i had a lot of a lot of friends  actually kennison i helped get his first spot at the comedy store wow and michael richards i helped 
[02:47:30]  get his first spot at the improv i helped get him his last spot at the laugh factory  well you can do so much with a good iphone  and uh i was friends with mike binder who was all right filmmaker and a lot of people shandling was a  friend i mean i was not close but hung out with seinfeld and one time i took everybody to disneyland  george wallace seinfeld channeling i took everybody to disneyland we were like 24 years old 
[02:48:00]  i just wanted to be like some faggy cheerleader you know i was just all idealistic and  hey come on guys we're all comics yeah come on let's make people laugh tonight it's like no bob  we're supposed to be miserable when we're not on stage stop it but you knew these guys don't you  know about coke but you knew these guys before obviously they were famous i always find that  fascinating i would sit in the back of the room with this i would sit there and uh billy crystal was  really nice to me and he had just gotten on soap and and we were sitting watching people and what 
[02:48:30]  prior was going on so i would and i started emceeing a lot so i would bring up robin a lot and uh robin  was getting he had just gotten laugh into that george schlutter did the song to laugh that's right  so robin did that and and letterman went off to go do his morning show on nbc he was really nice  what year is all this like 78 78 79 and leno was really nice i mean i know leno is as a guy that  was just the construction worker's favorite comedian you know you don't stage in a denim shirt right 
[02:49:00]  right what's going on with these people yeah it was it was fun there were a lot of what's the  obsession with the denim shirts i think he's i think he's just he's a little yeah he's got a hundred of  them it works like he probably feels that's my pattern and they said johnny was like that too though  very very ritualistic very routine every 10 a.m call fred to court of every he did the exact same  thing every day and when you get that gig i imagine you're like i got this gig don't it up so 
[02:49:30]  whatever worked yesterday it hopefully will work today well it's interesting because i'm going to  talk about that a little bit on found tomorrow night the guy got the spot i mean it's pretty  it's unbelievable and i understand it because i it's a crazy thing i like it because it goes into a  little more variety show type thing it brings a little bit i'm not a game lover i don't want to  see people do bar things on tv or whatever i like a chat show where people just do this but i also like 
[02:50:00]  that i used to love 10 o'clock at night dean martin show i used to love an attempt at people coming on  just fucking around different musicians come out and just doing whatever so if there's that kind of  element to a show where god bless jonathan winters someone like that can walk in knock on the door and  just fuck around yeah yeah that if the people that run the show are big enough it's a dean martin type  person if jimmy does that kind of thing i don't know he just went right like right to the top he's  awesome it's amazing he comes in to do this show uh and he and he's a nice guy yeah genuinely yeah he 
[02:50:30]  came in to do our show when they were kind of experimenting with it on the on the internet  remember he was doing test shows and now look what he's doing online it was online they were like  feeling it out that's when we met him for the first time and now look at him holy i met him he was in  la and uh it was funny i was on oprah and i was they had five comedians discovering people  and i was discovering a guy named bob oshack who i need to discover again 
[02:51:00]  really funny comedian great guy and uh bill murray was on and bill murray via tape discovered jimmy  fallon said that was the guy that he wanted to discover and jimmy had just started on snl he was  the one of the new guys and and bill maher had somebody he discovered i can't remember but it was  uh i went into i didn't know jimmy i went into oprah's uh booth and put on a headset and said hey jimmy 
[02:51:30]  i really like your work and just started trying to talk dirty to him because we were on the  satellite at oprah so it just felt like something bad to do i had my balls were heavy filled  that day right that was all i'm at oprah and i'm using their room as a telephone  but um i met him oh sorry the first time i met him i think we did a show um in bryant park it was  uh an outdoor show obviously and um i went up and it bombed completely and the other 
[02:52:00]  guy i was working with bombed completely and no one knew jimmy he i think just again maybe just  got snl and uh they're like this next guy and he was a guitar act and we don't mean any of the  comic will go yeah but he did great he really got laughs and there you go you could see he was really  funny there's nothing worse than when you guys bomb and the other guy kills so it's like oh it wasn't  totally the crap they really it was possible to entertain them they really wanted to be entertained  i was that guitar act i could never take the guitar off when i started i used to sing while 
[02:52:30]  my guitar gently weeps and i had a valve with a shampoo bottle filled with water i would turn it  and water would pour out of my guitar so it was common common combination of you know gallagher  and a music act and i was hated so bad i was at the improv one night and larry david is before larry  did fridays even was standing there and larry was very we'd get very amped up before going on didn't  and didn't always like kind of was caustic toward the audience even before so he would be like that 
[02:53:00]  and somebody was on stage and i'm standing next to larry holding a guitar so it's a scene basically  from curb it really felt like it larry's watching the guy on stage and we're right there it's like  in the improv in la you're too close to the stage and all the comics are just looking and you're  you're kind of lit it's just weird and larry's going oh they're laughing at this guy i don't  know if i want to go on and and he said this police people are stupid you know and they want a  guitar act and i looked and i had a guitar and he didn't even realize he'd said it and he looked at me 
[02:53:30]  and then i went oh and then i was like like 23 i'm just so hurt at least it didn't have an impact  on your life where you remembered it oh my god but i also agreed with him i wish i didn't have  the guitar because i was going to go up and do like parodies a piece just a piece of  that i was and then uh of course my new special has a lot of music on it but um but then larry went on  stage right after this guy who did jokes that larry didn't like and larry was right he was completely 
[02:54:00]  right the guy was doing real feed the audience pablum stuff and larry started and went oh it's  just hilarious very known for doing this oh so it is it is you people or someone like he's you know  what oh wow it is you i don't even remember what the joke was i just remember him going  fuck you and next thing i knew they said ladies and gentlemen bob saget because he was gone and there  i was with my guitar feeling like i he was right and this is going to work and i'm a piece of comedic 
[02:54:30]  shit there's so many stories of course i killed pitching like that but it was you know i would do  just parodies that he would leave the stage yeah just yell at the audience pitch in the middle of  doing something he would just go ah fuck this and walk off the stage it's like what that doesn't get  it was so funny it doesn't get anywhere tracy's always does the opposite tracy would be like well  even the virus tour but he would go uh i'm gonna walk him bobby i went why are you gonna walk i'm

[02:58:30]  really i find it really there is nothing then i find it really strange that sorry i was in the  other room i find it strange that we're friends because i like when i was doing radio in buffalo  as a fucking nobody doing overnights on we would watch america's funniest home videos  yeah and we'd have pizza it was the thing to watch yeah but the radio guys would get together like we 
[02:59:00]  got you know it was the show to watch right and i remember we made a point of you know picking a  house getting beers pizza chicken wings because it was buffalo right watching you and then fast  forward here you are and we're kind of pals yeah it's just strange to me man well it's nice you used  to always compliment me and some people gave me a lot of shit for that show because the jokes were what  they were and everything but it was eight it was started at seven o'clock at night on a sunday  night what are you here's a guy getting hit in the dick you can't really do that yeah i hosted a 
[02:59:30]  blooper show yeah yeah that's what it was did we ever play no i don't even want to go there what is it  bad no we did a silly bloopers radio bit once oh really i don't even know if it holds up it's not  worth was it about that yeah yeah everybody did it did something do you have it like loaded up  not us it's whatever oh they made fun of it a lot i made fun of it once i hosted snl and  we did america's funniest hate videos and it was real funny it was chris farley and david spade and 
[03:00:00]  they were two guys in the woods at uh militiamen and they shot each other's heads off they really  filled a balloon with baked beans and that's how they shot farley's head and they had they had a clan  member on fire that was a clan member on fire you know these are the nominees yeah nominees i like  the show i really did man well you've always been very very complimentary to me but i've been coming  on here now for a long time yeah i long time i know i was one of those guys i was extremely surprised at 
[03:00:30]  your stand-up because i didn't get a chance to see you and i finally did i'm like five seconds  fucking dirty you were fun you came out westbury i think when you were yeah we hung with your daughters  and those were my daughters oh no they were playing the part that night yeah hi eric he's a good  he's a good father man i have daughter yes he's a big time father i said we're not going to do  anything you're going to pretend you're my daughter right here's a thousand dollars nothing sexual  even looking you dress well i love my my kids are awesome you took your parenting pretty seriously 
[03:01:00]  yeah i think a lot of people do they're wrong right you have to obviously it's tough i meet a lot of  uh uh women especially just don't have fathers at all they just don't have the dad just didn't  do anything just said fuck you i didn't care i don't know how you thank god where where the hell  would we be i would you know that's true parenting makes lonely nights for anthony that's really true  you really need a girl with a bad father so you can need some baggage swoop in every void by the way 
[03:01:30]  jim i was gonna say you beat me by oh my god that's right obviously he's actually he named  his after me i bet you it's as tall as me at this point i bet more mass of his own body is coming out  of him what if he created an exact opposite that just comes out of him this twin his his twin  he shit his own twin out i finally that's a great movie you got something on that a lot of people  don't know this but he told me he's been holding this since last night why that's what he does why 
[03:02:00]  does he hold well he wasn't in labor till this morning yeah no he does weird things like that  he holds his shit yeah we're gonna have to ask him when he comes back well that's a problem  i don't know that's bad for you you can get hemorrhoids you can get um you get bowel cancer from  holding it you know what shit's got in it shit you don't want to keep that in as soon as i get  that feeling as soon as i get that feeling it's time to get rid of it i love getting rid of it  fuck yeah it's fucking awesome even people say i don't do it on a plane but i'm so good at anything 
[03:02:30]  like i'm yoga yoga's like helped me yeah i don't even do yoga but i mean you don't care at home i  rehearse basically my yoga is just in training for airplane shitting squat squatting bob  yeah it's like get it done with quick yeah one of uh life's simple pleasures is when you can't  cut it loose and you get a nice long one and it's over huh oh you mean it just stays there forever  no i mean you think you're you're you're snapping off logs but it turns out to be one 
[03:03:00]  nice really long one and then you got a little amazement in your life for the day well hold on  i'm still caught on the end you don't like this stuff anthony anthony's trying to figure out if  you like the sensation of keeping it in there i thought no no no no no i'm talking when you're  when it's a giant tube stick yeah you're releasing but you know you're not cutting off individual  logs it becomes one really long but see i can't relate to this because you need to know as as he's  dropping logs he flushes immediately while he's still sitting on the toilet i have i do that 
[03:03:30]  sometimes i like it i don't want to see what i did you know i like to look and make sure i'm not  there's no glass in it but yeah you know like i ate rocks yeah jimmy what happened you're smiling  well i gotta be honest um i've never experienced anything like this that's 20 minutes yeah i i take  slow shits but i went upstairs i would say not a great one it was one of those ones where you know  it's going to be like i felt like i was forcing out baby carrots covered in peanut butter oh jesus 
[03:04:00]  did you eat either of those things everything turns to peanut butter i eat a lot of baby carrots  but you love the ones in the package yeah that's what so that was it orange yeah no no no i'm saying  they were small and uh it was just hard to get it all going and i'm like oh boy is wiping gonna be a  nightmare like you know nothing's worse than when your shit uh sounds like you just threw pebbles in  the water yeah oh the bag of rocks oh it's the worst mine sounded like uh it sounded like you had 
[03:04:30]  soaked a golf ball in peanut butter and you were rolling it down a peanut butter gutter  does that like mousetrap it wasn't good my mother's old and i probably shouldn't talk about  this but sometimes i'll take her to the restroom somewhere and i'll drop her off and it's like  the act itself for an older person is probably about 12 seconds tops but the maintenance can be 45  minutes because there's old flesh you have to get uh-huh is that did you have a lot of wait wait 
[03:05:00]  wait wait wait wait wait wait you're putting a fanny pack did you shit in that fanny  bob hold on a second you're giving us way too much material have you had to wipe your mom's  no i have not not not uh i mean i do it electively  okay yeah whether she needs it or not yeah yeah  i'm actually i'm starting a website yeah it's uh wipe my mom's ass dot com i've been able to  dot net i have dot com i've been able to avoid it but there are family members that  might have had to wipe my mom's ass yeah my mom shits her pants she's gonna have to 
[03:05:30]  fucking hose out i love it i can't wipe her how about how about how about how about this people  marrying into our family had to do it to your mom no yes because it's a girl thing is your mom alive  now i think so but someone has to wipe her ass yeah i think she might still be alive she can't do it  but she's just an avid reader i'm not i'm saying i could come over oh you want to give it a shot  i would are you kidding i'd love to wipe your mouth some of my sister-in-law friends some of my

[03:12:00]  night's one that's a big hit that's a big hit oh  and i'm thinking of dying dying dying all the time time time was he uh traveling uh will barry he  was he was right it was him and tom petty who i didn't mind that shit talented guy and uh 
[03:12:30]  boy orbson i got to meet once i was pretty fucking excited like with george harrison a lot  jefflin yeah yeah and they were god if i'd have met that there's a any i'll take any beetle  well ringo even pete best i'd be happy wow we had him in that is going back what was it like  he sits down let's get this all i just picture him bitter everywhere he's a bit better he doesn't  hide it still he's not happy how that worked out for him yeah that's not good think about losing 
[03:13:00]  that lottery but it but he also had to bring a lot to it so he couldn't yeah it wouldn't have happened  i mean ringo wrote great songs i mean everybody did everyone goofs on ringo they do and he's done  some amazing things i think people wrote that shit for him i really do oh i don't think he really  it was part of the creative process you don't think about the ringo stuff lennon and mccartney  wouldn't have been able to pin any hits i don't think i can no i think i think i think we should  go back to jim's shit i think i'm stuck my foot all the way down my the sad part was nothing 
[03:13:30]  pete best was trying to reinvent himself do you remember what the bad was or anything from that  interview because all we're thinking is you were so close to being he also has the worst name that is  the such a rough name terrible name to have he's the best and he was the last it should be pete last  last well the beatles didn't think he was the best no not right pete not as good as  right pete mediocre mediocre yes fair to midland pete poor yeah poorly he was cool though so yeah 
[03:14:00]  we didn't like him but you could tell he's like oh he's still having a tough time man you can't move  on with your life in that situation he wakes up every morning in shock and goes  get a bit of beetle yeah that's his first thought every morning i don't well he was just uh i think  they used him i think because he had the recording space or something i'm trying to remember they  did well my beetle trivia i think his mom owned the uh place where they could play that's what i i 
[03:14:30]  think it was and that's why they brought pete in like they basically said well let's bring him in  and we could use his mom's joint there's a movie downbeat didn't that what it's about  i don't know i've never seen my mic off you know i think i'm so tired it's probably a good time to  just turn my mic off you guys talk to me and i'll just answer him this is the best time to talk to  you i love when it's five in the morning in la and you're always nice so you go okay bob's got to

[03:22:30]  Montreal is Thursday and Friday?  Yeah  Do we know what the deal is with people coming?  I've been getting tweets from people who say they want to come and watch the show  They say if they bring a snack or a treat, they get in  Okay, you're gonna be the door guy then?  Yeah  It's gonna be in a conference room  And now we're talking about maybe being able to get like 30 or 40 listeners in every day  We'll figure it all out  Yeah  Cause there's definitely an interest  Cause I've been getting tweets from people who are like, I'll be there  We're a big fucking show, Sam Roberts 
[03:23:00]  I don't know  Of course there's interest  You sound surprised  You wonder  Listen  I'm just saying we know for sure there's an interest  Okay  Let's not all get carried away with ourselves  Well, we knew before that  You act like you're just figuring it out now  Get the fuck out of here, drawbreaker  Why?  I don't even know what that shirt is  You like that one, Rory?  Yeah  I just read his t-shirt  It wasn't a good joke at all  What'd you get so upset about?  I hope he's leaving  He was just showing me  Coke Logic animated the Gary Busey production piece on YouTube 
[03:23:30]  Yeah  It's very exciting  It looks cool  I got a new venture  I got a YouTube channel that does pretty well  OP Radio on YouTube  Yeah  Please subscribe  I beg you  Cause I want numbers  Right  And I'm heading toward like 50,000 subscribers on my YouTube channel  Nice  My videos do pretty well  I got about 45 million total views  Hey  Now I'm gonna kind of like start accepting outside content 
[03:24:00]  You give people getting some cash-ish for it?  Well people are making videos  Right  But they just don't get the views on their YouTube channel  So I'm gonna like maybe put up one a week from the listeners  Man, there you go  And then you get the listeners some exposure  Right  You get some numbers for yourself  Then I'll get some more numbers  Cause you know  I'm gonna pick only the best ones out there  You know what I would do?  They already sent me shitty fucking videos  I'm like no  It's gotta be something special  Like the first one  I decided to start with Coke Logic  Cause I'm a huge fan of his animations 
[03:24:30]  Yeah  And he animated the Gary Busey thing  That you guys put together  Yeah I think it's the one  Yeah I'm assuming it's the one Troy and me did  I haven't seen it all yet  Gary Busey and his crazy thoughts  Yeah  I think I call it his crazy brain or something like that  From when Gary Busey was on this very show  Yeah  After opening  Yeah I didn't even get to talk to him  Yeah  I had nothing to do with Gary Busey  But it's on my YouTube channel  So give Coke Logic some clicks  Well it's all part of your brand  Don't you realize  You have created this brand  That extends beyond you  You don't have to be there 
[03:25:00]  For it to be yours  It's a beautiful thing  I like that  You know  I like that  You can be at home  Right  And still what's going on  It's yours  Right  And you know  I mean the people that put their videos together  They get all the credit on my channel  Right  They'll be able to promote whatever the fuck they want  And it's not only the best  It's the best of the best  They're gonna make it on the channel  Don't be sending bullshit  Thinking  Oh I'm gonna be the next  Some guy just filmed  Like  A birthday  A birthday announcement  It was like one of those  You know  Chip  You don't want to 
[03:25:30]  You know  Wish  Chip  Chiperson a happy birthday  You know how  Those things make the news  Like when they put them on  When the news is wishing happy birthday  And you give them the  Some guy films it  Like with just his fucking  His phone  You know  Just filmed it shitty  And he sent it in to me  Like oh here  Here you go  No  No it's gotta be something special  Yes  Next week I think it's a  Patrice O'Neill bit  That was animated by another guy  You remember when Patrice O'Neill took the United States 
[03:26:00]  And made it into five or six super states  Right  Yes of course  This guy animated it  And out of nowhere he goes  Hey you know  I'd appreciate it if you check out mine  So I clicked on it  I'm like holy fuck  This is good  Yeah I'll put it up next week  And the guy's thrilled  So  That's fantastic  Because on his channel  It only did  I don't even think it did  A thousand views  And you know  Well you have a lot of eyes  That automatically will go to your channel  Well I will guarantee  20,000 views is easy  You can make that guarantee  Yeah but then after that  It could go up to  You know  I got a bunch of videos  In the hundreds of thousands of views 
[03:26:30]  And a few in the millions  I can guarantee on my channel  Over 800 views  Oh that's pretty good  So I can  And that's a guarantee  That's pretty good  So if somebody wants  To up their  You know  View count  Over 800  Yeah I'm not going to oversell it  I could guarantee about 20,000 views  For CokeLogic's video easily  I think his will do even better  Yeah CokeLogic is cemented  As an icon  As far as animating  This show goes  So have we given up  On the idea of doing another  Opie and Anthony show  Animation festival  And instead  Would you put them on your YouTube channel 
[03:27:00]  I had that meeting  It's got to be two months ago  So  Well I remember  We had a meeting  Saying like  Okay well what would we need  For it  And then it just  Disappeared  Dude they blue sky'd it  Yeah  That's a good thing  Correct  In the words of Eric Logan  They blue sky'd it  It's not baking anymore  They said yeah  Let's do this  I haven't heard  Word one  From the guys down the hall  Nothing  I'm not going to  Fucking start making  Phone calls to venues  And shit  That's up to you  Of course  Yeah you can't  We got a great concept  It went away for way too long  We did one 
[03:27:30]  It was a huge success  And now we want to do  The second animated festival  Well can you imagine  Being on the phone  With a venue  Saying I'd like to book  Your venue  For the Opie and Anthony  Animation festival  Right  And they'll go  Who's this  And you'll go  This is Opie  It's my festival  I was thinking  I could just rent it myself  Right  Normally people like you  In your position  Would have people to do that  Yeah  That's Kenny  Sorry  What's Kenny saying  He wants to know  If I want to ride home  Do you  No

[03:32:00]  Brother Joe in Long Island  And in Orlando  How do I come out of a  God damn death dedication  Just kidding  It is after  Open Anthony Live  And you can call up  If you got a  What did you learn  866  Wow1Wow  I like the  TWA  Flight 800 people today  Because what sold me  On them  When conspiracy theorists  Come in  I don't like that they  Agree with pretty much  All other conspiracy theories  You know what I mean  You can't just say  Oh yeah 
[03:32:30]  I think  Flight 800  Was shot down by a missile  And that's it  You also have to be like  Also  9-11 was an inside job  Kennedy assassination  Inside job  The Bilderbergs  Are taking over the world  And that airport  Out in Denver  Is fucked  Like you can't just  Believe one of those things  You have to believe  All of them  And I tend to give  A lot more credence  To the  To the conspiracy  Theorists  That just believes  In one theory  Because that means  That they've actually  I'm going to keep these 
[03:33:00]  Sydney  But thank you  Because that means  That they actually  Have done some research  And that they're  Discerning enough  To say  No that one  That one doesn't seem real  No leave that open  This one  This one does  And so it makes me go  Like okay  This person has a brain  In their head  What are you laughing at  Jackie  Yeah  Why  Why  What's so funny  Nothing  Because we're cleaning up  And we just keep  Grabbing stuff  They don't want us to  It's alright  See this is what I do  I can instruct  And do a show  At the same time 
[03:33:30]  I wear so many hats  It's because my head's big  What a professional  But exactly  A professional broadcaster  And I'm screening calls  At the same time  I'm amazing  Let me go to  Snowy in Michigan  What's up buddy  Hey Sam  Long time no hear  Why  I've been on vacation  For a while  I don't have  Next to me at my house  So I've heard  The show in a while  I'm glad you're back  At work  Yeah back  Back at the grindstone  Yeah  Hey you know  I learned today  I did not know  That Bob Seckett 
[03:34:00]  Was a fan  Of Electric Light Orchestra  Yeah hello  Neither did I  Who knew  Well I'm a big fan  Of him so I'm kind of  That's kind of cool  And some famous person  Like the same thing  I like  Bob Saget is so funny  Because he's one of those celebrities  Like Opie said  He had dinner with him  And he said you can't imagine  How recognizable this dude is  That they were eating outside  And people just constantly  Coming up to the table  I'll never forget  Bob Saget and Louis Black  Were in studio  The day that Mick Foley 
[03:34:30]  Force fed me steak  That was one of the first  Kind of big bits  That I did on the show  And they called my mom  It might have been the first time  My mom was on the show too  I don't remember  But they called her up  And like  You got this giant wrestler dude  Force feeding me steak and rice  You got Opie and Anthony  Saying terrible things about me  All this is going on  And I get home  And I go over to my parents house  And the first thing my mom says is  Oh Sam  I had to call all my sisters  And tell them that today 
[03:35:00]  I got to talk on the phone  With Bob Saget  Can you believe it  Yeah I can believe it  That wasn't  Yes you were on the phone  With Bob Saget  Can we talk about  What happened to me  No  Rick on Long Island  Hey what's going on  What happened to Jimmy's show today  Jim  He's on a plane to California  I guess I should have  Mentioned that before  Yeah I guess  I don't know if the advice show  Will be on later this week or not  But yeah  Jim's on a plane to California  And also too  You know 
[03:35:30]  One thing I don't understand  I know they touched a little bit  On this today  But you know  Here it is  They're so gloom  In this Fight 800 conspiracy  Yet they're constantly  Shutting down  Like every other conspiracy  I understand  Listen  Jesse Ventura comes across  As a nut  Right  But I mean  There are a lot of like  Real legitimate  You know  Conspiracies on 9-11  And they  O.P. Anthony and Jimmy  They're constantly  Shutting them down  Well I haven't seen  The documentary  The TWA 800 documentary yet 
[03:36:00]  I know it's going to be  On Epyx tonight  And it's going to be  On Epyx HD as well  EpyxHD.com  I mean  But  So I haven't seen it  Apparently  This documentary  Is like ridiculously  Compelling  And has  Convinced  At least Anthony and Jim  That this is at least  Worth looking into  I know  I mean  At one point  Jim did kind of  Give some kind of  Thought to  The idea that  9-11 could be  An inside job  But he watched  Loose Change  He said  Okay this is worth  Looking at  And then he got  The guy on the phone 
[03:36:30]  That did the movie  And there was just  So many holes  In the theory  That just don't add up  That it didn't  I mean I think  Everybody here realized  That that stuff  It just didn't make  Any sense  Yeah but I mean  There are  I mean there are  A lot more documentaries  Besides that  Loose Change one  I watched the  Loose Change one  Once  And there definitely  Are a bunch of  Empty holes in that one  But you know  But as far as  The flight 800  I mean I live on  Long Island  I lived in Quorum  For years  But I have family  In Mastic  And I also have  Family in  Suffolk Police Department  And you know  They've been saying 
[03:37:00]  Since this thing  Happened that it  Was a missile  You know  I mean  Yeah  And I was actually  I was talking to Sal  About it earlier today  That everybody  From the beginning  Like you said  People thought it was  A missile that hit  This plane  And then 9-11 happens  And everybody forgets  About flight 800  It was the same thing  When you know  Everybody thought  Gary Condit  Or whoever  Had killed  Chandra Levy  And then 9-11 happens  We forget about  Gary Condit  We forget about  TWA flight 800  So nobody realizes  That Gary Condit  Was found to be 
[03:37:30]  Completely innocent  And this flight 800  Thing was never  Really solved  To the liking  Of most people  Right  And then I think  Another thing too  That people don't  Tend to tie into that  I mean  I think it was  Within just a few weeks  That the bombs  In Atlanta  At the Olympics  Happened  Right  I'm not saying  They're tied in  But I mean  Maybe it's a coincidence  I don't know  It's worth looking at  Though isn't it  Absolutely  Alright  I gotta sign out  I'm at work  Alright buddy  Thanks  I'll talk to you later  Yeah  But I mean  Every time anything happens 
[03:38:00]  There's a conspiracy theory  Like you know  This Boston bombing thing  Happened  And it's amazing  What's happened  With the Boston bomber  Because  At first  It was  Open and shut  You know  When we were all  Watching CNN  You remember  The live show  We did here  We were all  Watching CNN  And Fox News  And every news channel  It was around  The clock coverage  While police  Scoured the Boston neighborhood  Where they were in  Looking  For this Boston bomber  What's it  Jakar  Is that his name 
[03:38:30]  What's his name  Eric  Is that how you pronounce it  I guess so  Jakar  Jafar  A lot of letters  With no vowels  Yeah  Because it starts with  D-Z-H-O  But it's definitely  Pronounced like a J  But  And so they finally  Find him  And everybody's like  Yay  And it takes  Two seconds  First of all  Alex Jones  Who's already  Shouting  About false flags  But  They find this guy  And I guess  All the teeny bopper girls  Think that he's like cute  And so it takes no time  For a giant 
[03:39:00]  Teenage Twitter campaign  To start  Supporting this dude  And he's on the cover  Of Rolling Stone  This week  He went out  And he  He's pleading  Not guilty  To these charges  But if you look  All the news sites  Have it up  The cover of  Rolling Stone  On the side  On the side  It says  In this issue  They're talking about  Getting on  Willie Nelson's  Tour bus  They're talking about  Jay-Z's new album  Magna Carta  They're talking about  Robin Thicke  And the great summer  He's had  But a giant 
[03:39:30]  Dreamy photo  Of the Boston Bombers  On the cover  Of the Rolling Stone  Yeah they shot him  Like a boy band  Yeah that's exactly  What they did  I mean I don't think  That they shot him  I would assume  That this is a photo  That they found  Photo shoot  No no  Yeah  I wish they had shot him  No I don't think  I don't think  That they did  This photo shoot  I think they must  Have found it  Because I don't think  Well I  I guess he pled  Not guilty  But I would think  That he would not  Be going to photo shoots  He still got his  His jaw all  Wired 
[03:40:00]  And his face  Being reconstructed  That's true  Yeah he's all  Fucked up  So this is not  Anything recent  But they did  Find the dreamiest  Boy bandiest  Picture possible  To throw him  On the cover  Robin Thicke  Is probably sitting there  Going like  What the fuck  Do I have to do  This summer  You had a video  With naked women  I put titties  In my video  I find  I have this song  That's everywhere  And who do they  Put on the cover  I mean I'm on the side  Even his dad's  Been on the cover  Has Alan Thicke  Been on the cover  No but let's  Just go with it 
[03:40:30]  He should have  Been on the cover  Alan Thicke  Is probably looking  At this magazine  Going god damn it  You know how many  TV theme songs  I wrote  You know how long  I was married  To Maggie Seaver  On television's  Growing Pains  I never got the cover  Of Rolling Stone  And now you put  The Boston Bomber  Up there  It says  Like it says  In big letters  The Bomber  How a popular  Promising student  Was failed  By his family  Fell into radical  Islam  And became a monster  Seems a little  Sensational  But you know 
[03:41:00]  I don't know  John in Virginia  Hey guys  I was listening  Earlier to the  Conspiracy theories  And they were  Talking about  The injuries  Were sporadic  And not consistent  With where  They said the plane  Blew up  And things like that  Who said the people  Were sitting in the seats  That they were assigned  I would think that  People would have  Grouped together  Considering their religion  People were  Comforting each other  Who said they were  Sitting in their  Assigned seats  Yeah that's true  I mean  I tend to have  I haven't seen  The documentary  As I said  But I just  I tend to have 
[03:41:30]  A problem  For me  Conspiracy theories  Fall apart  When you can't  Answer the basic  Questions  And the basic  Question of  Well who shot  A missile  And why didn't  Anybody take  Credit for it  The fact that  We can't really  Answer that  Makes me wonder  You know  Well how can you  How can you  Believe it  But I'd still  I want to see  This documentary  Because I'm  Very open to  Having my mind  Changed on it  I really want to  See it too  But I also  Think a lot  Of it goes  Back to what  The judge  Was talking  About last  Week with  The Zimmerman  Trial  Everybody wants 
[03:42:00]  To be the  One who  Catches that  Little nugget  Of information  Of oh I'm  The one  Who solved  It not  The actual  People who  Are trying  To look  Into who  Solved it  Right right  Right right  Right yeah  I mean you  Get that a lot  So I do  Want to see  The film  Thanks  Yeah  Mark in  Texas  Hey Sam  What's going  On  I just  Remember  Something  Didn't you  Guys have  An intern  There named  Alan Thicke  Junior  Yeah  He was not  Actually related  To Alan Thicke  Or Robin Thicke  The thing was 
[03:42:30]  His name  Just happened  To be Alan  So I started  Calling him that  Oh okay  Thanks  Yeah no problem  Didn't you  Explain that  A thousand times  Like  People don't  Listen to  Every  Every  Hour I guess  When that guy  Called in  I was dying  I was cracking up  Well I  Didn't Opie  At one point  Say  Is he related  To Alan Thicke  No I just  I started calling  Him that  You really have  It's a weird  Thing to just  Start  You know  Calling somebody  For no reason  I almost hate  To say this  I kind of  Miss having 
[03:43:00]  Alan around  Of course you  Do  Because instead  We don't have  Last time  We had interns  It was Alan Thicke  Junior  Where we could  Mess with him  And shave his eyebrows  And tell him  He was stupid  And all this stuff  It's a lot of fun  I kind of miss him  And you put somebody down  And you realize  It really does  Make you feel better  About yourself  Oh absolutely  Like you say  These horrible things  About somebody  And you're like  Oh man  I feel great  You know  Like you tell somebody  Oh man  You're such a moron  And you're like  Wow  Not only  Did I get to 
[03:43:30]  Express my opinion  On him  But I feel so much  Smarter  Like this makes  The fact that  He's a moron  Makes me a genius  I guess  When I got to  Shave his eyebrows  I was like  Fuck  Today's a good day  Look how great  My eyebrows look  Because of his  Bad fortune  Everything's coming up  Roses for me  Yeah  But now you're stuck  With the girl interns  Who just  Everybody's fawning over  Yeah  You can't have  You can't replace  A doldrum  With two cute interns  Who think it's gonna be  Just as fun  It's pretty much a 180  Yeah it is 
[03:44:00]  It's a complete 180  Absolutely  Competent people  And Alan  Especially for a guy  Like you  Yeah  Because you're bottom  Of the totem pole  Yeah  And you just  Take a heaping  Helping of shit  Literally every show  Yeah  And so you're sitting there  Going  It's great that Alan's here  Because finally  There's someone I can throw  Under the bus  Finally there's somebody  I don't have to take shit from  Finally there's somebody  Even O&A  Will shit on more than me  And then he gets replaced  With these two interns  That have quite frankly  Skyrocketed over all of us  It's true 
[03:44:30]  I mean every single one  It's true  Yeah I was thinking about  Alan the other day  And his just  You know  Oh man  You know when the last time  I thought about Alan was  Right now  When I just mentioned him  You know before that  When he left  Yeah when he was in studio  Getting his eyebrows shaved  I haven't thought about him  For one second  Since he walked out that door  He sent me a random text  Like weeks after his internship  He goes  Hey Sal  Are there any good bars  In New York City?  No not one Alan  It's like  New York City  Especially Manhattan  Is free from any good bar 
[03:45:00]  Alcohol consumption  In Manhattan  Just doesn't happen  Terrible  It's terrible  I've been getting emails  From Alan Thicke Jr. actually  Really?  Yeah  You know who he doesn't like  And I should  We're going to get him back in  For a reunion before long  Probably this summer  At some point  Cool  He does not like  Our current boy intern  He went to school with him  Right  And I think we talked about that  When we first had the boy intern in here  But our boy intern  Who's never on the air 
[03:45:30]  Mainly because he doesn't wear  Summer dresses to work  Has  I don't know if he knows  But Alan  Helped  I don't know if you  I wouldn't even say helped him  But Alan introduced him  To the show  And said  Hey this is it  This is where I'm interning  And he goes  He sees Alan  With all these pictures  Of celebrities  And you know  Working in radio  He's like  I want to do something cool  Like that  Alan's been emailing me  And telling me  What a douche  This kid is  And he told me  He's like  Look at his blog 
[03:46:00]  It's such garbage  I'm like  I'm not clicking on a blog  You're definitely not  No  What difference does it make  If you're writing a blog  Good for you  Like you should be  Don't think about me  The same way  You don't think about intern Alan  Right  Same idea  What was Alan doing  Nothing  I think about you  Yeah there you go  I think about you  With more esteem  Than I think about intern Alan  All college kids  Should be writing blogs  You know how much opportunity  There is out there  For kids right now  Just get on the internet  And put content out there  Who knows what people  Are going to latch on to  My personal hustle  That's what I'm trying to do 
[03:46:30]  Just get  I mean it's very douchey  When you say it like that  It's so horrible  But just say  I'm writing a blog  And I'm putting out  What I want to put out  And hopefully people like it  Don't say hustle  Like you know  Leave that for rap songs  To refresh some people  Right  Alan said  To us  Before we met Tyler  He said  Tyler's the boy intern  Tyler's yes  Our current intern  He said  Alan said  I posted a photo  With me and Mark Maron  On Facebook  And then Tyler  Hit me up  Asking like 
[03:47:00]  Oh where do you work  Like all this sort of stuff  Trying to inquire about it  He basically  Made the assertion  Tyler  That you the boy intern  Wanted to intern  For the Opie and Anthony show  Because you thought  You might get a photo  With Mark Maron  Yeah that was not the case  I was  I needed an internship  For the summer  And I've been wanting  To be in radio  For a while  Why  And I just saw  Why  Why did I want to be in radio  Yeah  I don't know  It's a waste of time  No one told me not to  Until I got here  Yeah terrible guidance counselors  In college right now  Awful  Yeah they're all about 
[03:47:30]  Like following your dreams  And stuff  It's crazy  I don't know why  Anybody would dream  To be in radio anymore  It's 2013  Somebody get the memo  And the other thing  That Alan said  And I wholeheartedly  Disagree with this  Is he called you  A hipster like douche  And I was like  When I met you  And even to this day  I don't consider Tyler  A hipster at all  No  Sal you're a hipster  Borderline yeah  I would say so  Okay  You're not a hipster at all  You're like  Just a  I get it a lot  I mean I'm wearing  An arcade fire shirt  Right now  But then you'll say that  You hear like  The bad guy  In the mighty ducks  Like you're not 
[03:48:00]  You're not even  Sort of a hipster  So that questions  Alan's perception  On the world  Surrounding him  Reality  You know what I mean  I don't think  It questions anything  I think it's a well known fact  That our former intern Alan  Is a moron  Yeah  You know  He's just got a terrible  Way of perceiving things  Now here's my question  Why is Jackie in here  Did she realize  Oh  It's intern time  I can't have boy intern  Getting any attention  I can't get five minutes  Of attention without you Jackie  Seriously Jackie  How many hours  Did you get on the air  Last night  While I did breakfast runs 
[03:48:30]  I said something to Eric  And he forced me in here  Oh okay  Yeah right  I saw you  I saw him dragging you  In here by your hair  Yeah  Is that why  You skipped in here  Like you always do  No  And you brought the sunshine  With you  I gotta be honest  Mood's better  It's true  It is  Let me see  Josh in Texas  Josh  Hey Sam  What's going on  How you doing buddy  Hey man  Intern douchebag  Whatever his name is there  That's right  Intern douchebag  Maybe you should try  Wearing a summer dress  To work  He might get some attention 
[03:49:00]  Have you ever thought  About dressing like  A pretty little girl  And seeing if it would help  I've thought about that a lot  Regardless of my internship here  You have  But I know  Like maybe  Maybe  Eric told me  Like one of my first weeks here  I should do frosted  Tips on my hair  And that would give me  Some attention  Oh come on  I did not say that at all  Yeah you did  You told me I should  Go blonde at least  Or something like that  What  That was one of the  Recommendations  For attention  Eric are you giving  The interns hair tips  That's my  That's what I do 
[03:49:30]  Eric feels like  The only way to success  Is to make sure you look  As much like  The lead singer  From Smash Mouth  As possible  So that's why  He's an all star  That's why he's giving you  That advice  That's exactly right Eric  And it hasn't  Steered you wrong  Has it  No it hasn't  You won't  Frost your tips  I don't have tips  I don't know  Don't you have to have  Short hair for that  Well you'd cut your hair  And then you'd get your tips  And you'd frost them  I don't know  I think I'm growing my hair  Out right now  Why  I might do locks of love  Eventually when it gets  Like long enough  But like I also wanted  To just like see  How long it can go 
[03:50:00]  I had it long in middle school  And now I just wanted to go  Like  I see  Hipsters keep their hair short  Isn't that right Sal  Generally  Yeah  You remember  You know your intern boss  That's him  Yeah  No fucking way  Intern douchebag  Is actually laughing  At a photo of Eric  With his hair bleached blonde  Eric how do you respond  Yeah I did that  But he's laughing at you  Okay  Doesn't matter  I did that  Are you saying  That the problem here  Is that he has bad taste  Bad taste 
[03:50:30]  Bad a lot of things  Ouch  I have a lot of bad things  Ouch  And Sal of course  Is taking it upon himself  To google image  Every embarrassing photo  He can find  Well Eric's got this cool one  With Paris Hilton  That's a famous photo  Is it  Yeah  That was very nice  I mean  Reg in New Jersey  Hey  How you doing  I just wanted to say  That  I was an intern  At Sirius  Five years ago  Who'd you intern for  The comedy station  Pete Dominic  It was like 
[03:51:00]  Comedy by request  Or something  Okay  But anyhow  When I was there  All the dude interns  Pretty much get ignored  All the hot chicks  Get all the air time  And that's just  Pretty much universal  Throughout  Not just on the  HL  So  Just wanted to put that in there  Bullshit  And  You know  So you're just  You're coming to SiriusXX  Trying to have a good time  And like get on the air  And everything  And then  Some little college girl  Comes along  And guess who's  Getting the attention  Oh my god 
[03:51:30]  Every time  Yeah but dude  If you had a show  Reg  If you had your own show  Right  And you had  One girl  You had a blonde  College girl  Who's sitting here  In a summer dress  Just giggling  And batting her eyelids  And laughing at everything  You say  And then you got  Some other kid  Who's got like  Jock hair  An arcade fire shirt  And has been accused  Of coming to work  Smelly in the past  Who do you think  Who do you think  You're going to spend 
[03:52:00]  Your time with  Power will corrupt me  Every time  So I give that to you  I don't blame you  I'm just saying  It sucks when you're  In the position  It does suck  As soon as you have  Power  Forget about it  All bets are off  But you know  Right  I mean thanks Reg  The only reason that  Quite frankly  That you're in here now  Is the same reason  Why you're growing out  Your hair  What's that?  Charity  I mean I feel bad  It's like you want  To grow out your hair  For the cancer kids  Because you feel bad 
[03:52:30]  For them  They're kids with cancer  And you want them  To have at least some wigs  It gives me an excuse  To grow my hair out  I get it  And also it's like  Well no I'm doing it  For locks of love  You can't make fun of that  He's a good guy  Whereas me  Nobody can make fun of me  For being like  Why would you put  Intern douchebag  On the air  And I'll be like  Because I feel for the kid  I feel bad for him  You definitely do  More than most people here  I feel like  Well most people  Don't know you exist  Exactly  They didn't know  Your internship started  They thought it was over  They don't know  So what was Alan saying  In the  Just that he was 
[03:53:00]  Just that he was a douchebag  He was trying to turn me  Against this guy  But I don't know  I don't know why  Did you and intern Alan  Not get along  I mean like  We just don't  We were like  Two rooms apart  In college  But we didn't really  Interact that much  He was always really loud  That was like  The main thing  I took away from  You probably did a lot  Better with women  Than he did right  I didn't do too well either  But I still think  I did better  Yeah he complained  Many times about  Not doing well at all  Okay  I'm yeah  Not that  You didn't do well  You're not a bad looking guy 
[03:53:30]  He's not a bad looking guy  Is he Troy  Sorry  Nicole wanted to fuck him right  No that was Alan  I'm talking about  Oh I'm sorry  I'm sorry  No now this guy  Intern douchebag  He's not like an ugly guy  You'd think he'd do alright  With girls  I mean college girls  Just give it up  I'm not about like  That  You should be  Yeah  What are you  Like a little  Joe DeRosa-y  You know what I mean  I don't know what you mean  Well we learned that yesterday  Joe DeRosa is  Let's just say  He's a picky  When it comes to women  Yeah  I mean I'm quality  Over quantity definitely 
[03:54:00]  You like quality  Yeah  You like to have a dick  Yeah  You do  No  Okay  Because Joe does  Oh yeah  He's made that clear  Well I don't understand that  You'd realize  That at some point  You won't be in college anymore  And you'll look back  And be like  What the fuck  Yeah I'm aware  Like Troy  Do you think it's a good move  How old are you  21  To be making that kind of decision  To not be fucking as many girls  As you possibly can be  Yeah  Yeah  That's a bad  It's terrible right  Because 
[03:54:30]  I shouldn't be turning down fours  Like I shouldn't be like  Nah  I mean you should be taking  Whatever is coming your way  Because first of all  You're only going to be in college once  You can only really kind of  Go through that one time  You have that many girls  Yeah  At your fingertips  Right  Like it's any  Literally  Any given weekend  They're just  Bars  Full of girls  They're so dumb  Yeah but it doesn't matter  You're not trying to  Play Jeopardy with them  Okay  You just have to  Stick your penis in them  And then when you find  A hot girl  That's like an eight or a nine 
[03:55:00]  That you're like  Okay I'm going to hang on  To this girl  You've had a lot of practice  Then you're like  You blow her fucking mind  Yeah  You fucked all these pigs  Right  That's what they're there for  Yeah  And they're like  Wow where did you learn  How to do all this shit  It's like  Yeah  These fucking  So you only like  Girls you can like  Have a conversation with  Yeah  You do  You're a relation  That's really lame isn't it  No I get it  I mean I'm not  You're a relationship type  I guess  But I've only been  In two relationships  How many women  Have you been with  Slapped with  Four  Okay  So you are 
[03:55:30]  I just said that  That's not that bad  For his age  No  Is that not that bad  How old are you  21  21 yeah  I mean these days  The kids are getting around  A little more  Than back in the day  Yeah  But  I feel like I'm behind  I'll be honest with you  A little bit  That's not bad  That's not bad  But yeah  I would clean up  But like here's the thing  Alright so  I had a roommate  That was all about  Like just getting it in  Every single weekend  And like I would watch him  Like try and do this  And I was never impressed  With what he was bringing back  And like I was like  I'll stick to like  To blow a load  Like every weekend  Yeah it's just fun  To stick your penis 
[03:56:00]  In a stranger  Here's the thing  This is the whole thing  I get being  I haven't learned that yet  I get being  That's why  You never hear somebody  Disappointedly say  Oh man  I got some strange  Last night  It's always an exciting thing  Yeah  Because it's something  Brand new  Take my word  This is what you'll realize  That I was in  Relationships  When I was in college  Not with Jess  I didn't get with  I didn't start my relationship  With Jess until after  Well like around  Senior year of college  And that is 
[03:56:30]  I'm happy with  But before that  I was always in relationships  Yeah  And I look back on college now  And I regret things  Because these girls  That I was in relationships with  Weren't worth my time  You know what was worth my time?  Strange  Yes  Of course  Of course  Yeah  And strange just leads  To more strange  Because these girls  See that you're sleeping  With somebody else  And like oh  He's sleeping with all these girls  I want to sleep with them  Yeah  I mean I don't know  They'll consciously say  Look at that guy  He's fucked a lot of girls  I'd like to be one of those girls 
[03:57:00]  No but I think you know  That the psychology of a girl  Seeing other women around a guy  Makes them desire that guy  They'll sexualize you more I think  Right  Is what happens  And your confidence will grow  Because you'll realize  Like I don't  Like if I don't end up  Sleeping with this girl tonight  It's fine  The confidence that's just been  Shattered by the ONA  No the confidence  When you get an 8 or a 9  And you're like  Okay this chick's pretty banging  The confidence that you can go in there  And be like  I'm gonna fucking roundhouse this bitch  You know 
[03:57:30]  Something like that  I mean I don't know  If you'll ever get to roundhouse  Is that a technical move  That I've not learned yet  Let me go to Steve  In Pennsylvania  What's up Steve  Hey Sam  How you doing bud  Good  Hey uh  Who's the knucklehead  Is 21  And said he only slept with 4 girls  Which one of them knuckleheads  That's intern douchebag  That's me  Intern douchebag  Hey intern douchebag  Yes  You're half a homo  4 chicks  Are you kidding me  Okay so  Troy and me are saying  Okay that's not that bad  Some people are saying  Half a homo  Joe in Tampa  Hey there Sam 
[03:58:00]  How you doing  Good  Hey  Intern douchebag  Yes  You're saying quality over quantity  Who the fuck are you meeting in college  That's not quality  Like do you just go to really shitty parties  You should be seeing quality every night  Joe how old are you  I'm 26  Okay well we both realize  Because we're not that removed from college  But we are removed from college  And when you're in the moment  You don't think like  You don't think that college girls  Like there is a spectrum  But when you're away from college 
[03:58:30]  You realize that it's still college girls  There's nothing below a six and a half  Exactly  Young and fun  When you start working with people on a regular basis  You're going to meet a lot of twos  Right  Don't sleep with that  Joe's right  And you realize that in college  Some of these girls  Are sitting there  And they say to themselves  I'm going to make some decisions that I will regret  And I'm okay with that  That's when you pounce  Like going out into that night  They're like  I'm going to make bad decisions 
[03:59:00]  Yes  Be the mistake  Be ready for when they're  Want to make those bad decisions  Not for life  For now  For now  Be the mistake  For a moment  Less regrets in my life  Is that what I need to be doing  Just more  Carpe diem  You need to be the regret  Okay  You need to be someone else's regret  Because trust me  You will be  Batting practice  Just remember that  Yeah  And you know what batty's talking about right  Not really  It's your penis  Oh okay  It's your penis  Patrick in Connecticut  Yeah hey  First of all 
[03:59:30]  That other guy  Who started  Yelling at the intern  Douchebag  Or whatever his name is  He sounded like a douchebag himself  True  I mean it's a good point  Secondly  You know  If  I started dating my wife  When I was 20 years old  In college  And I love my wife  Listen  I love my wife  But I'm 29 now  And you know  I look back at what I could have done in college  Without a girlfriend  You'd regret it man 
[04:00:00]  Don't do it  Experiment  Doesn't mean you have to go like Troy  And start  Sticking your dick in every  Right  You don't have to roundhouse bitches  Just stop roundhouse bitches  I would definitely get out there  And you know  Have some stories  At least then  At least when you're married  For 10 years  Or  I don't know  Shit I'm there  Thanks Patrick  Listen to me  No Troy  No listen to me  Because you'll thank me later  Troy's an extreme  And when Troy comes in here  With his sleeves of tattoos  And his Robin Thicke hairdo  And his handsome chiseled jaw  And saying  Yeah you got a roundhouse bitches 
[04:00:30]  You're sitting there going like  I'm not gonna  That's not me  No  Find the medium  And just like  Spend a couple weekends  Hooking up with some random skanks  I like don't know  How to just like  Pull that trigger though  Of like  Hey  Like we haven't talked that much  But I'm about to put my dick in you  Well  Like I don't know  How do you do that  You say pretty much exactly that  We gotta go  You can just  You can just do that  Of course you can  We gotta go  I'll help you out buddy  We'll help you out  Maybe we'll talk to you about this  A little more tomorrow  Because Ron and Fez are coming up next  I hope you've learned something today  I hope I have too
