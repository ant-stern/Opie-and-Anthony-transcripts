<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a "Worst of 2013" segment focusing on Anthony Cumia's Bengal kitten, Beavis.  Extensive discussion covered Beavis's antics, including a video of him stealing Cumia's sunglasses, his sleeping habits, and the high-tech litter box.  The hosts speculated about getting Beavis a kitten companion, "Butthead."

Next, Guillermo del Toro visited the studio to promote his book, "Cabinet of Curiosities."  He discussed his vast monster memorabilia collection, his unique house designed to display it, his father's kidnapping, and paranormal experiences.  A large portion of the segment focused on del Toro's love for monster movies and his collection.

The show then launched into a scathing critique of a Criss Angel magic trick featuring Shaquille O'Neal's apparent levitation.  The hosts, along with callers, repeatedly called it a hoax, dubbed the "Shaq balloon," citing inconsistencies in the video footage.  They pointed out the lack of movement in Shaq's shirt, the sun glare, unconvincing crowd reactions (including Flavor Flav's presence), and used vulgar language and sexual references throughout the segment.  Criss Angel himself briefly called in, but the conversation ended abruptly.  The discussion expanded to other Criss Angel illusions, deemed poorly executed camera tricks, and comparisons were made to David Blaine's magic, considered superior.  A caller's discussion about their experience with a transsexual person led to a lengthy, crude, and sexually explicit conversation among the hosts about transsexual attraction.  The segment concluded with continued analysis of the "Shaq balloon" trick and Criss Angel's stagecraft.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about a man's encounter with a post-op transsexual, including graphic descriptions and picture sharing.  This transitioned into a conversation about differences in sexual practices across ethnic groups, specifically referencing Arab women.  The hosts then discussed Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal and newly released explicit photos, providing detailed descriptions and commentary.  The conversation suddenly shifted to an in-studio event: porn star Lexi Love giving a sponge bath to Bobo, a show regular.  This segment involved extremely graphic descriptions of Bobo's nudity, the bath, and Lexi Love's body. Bobo's discomfort and Lexi Love's professionalism were noted, along with a mention of a dildo attached to a bat.

The show then focused heavily on Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's scandals.  The hosts discussed media coverage, including incidents like impersonating a drunk driver and grabbing a woman.  Clips were played of Ford admitting to smoking crack cocaine, blaming his actions on drinking, and downplaying the severity of his substance abuse.  Allegations against his brother Doug regarding past hashish dealing were also mentioned.  A significant portion featured an interview with Rob and Doug Ford, conducted in a Toronto housing project rec room, showcasing Ford's defensiveness, anger, and apologies for swearing in front of children.  Ford discussed his political battles and vowed retaliation against opponents.  The show then analyzed wiretap revelations implicating Ford in further crack cocaine use and attempts to buy incriminating videos, alongside Ford's continued denials.  The segment concluded with Opie accidentally broadcasting E-Rock's phone number on-air, leading to a discussion of the ensuing chaos, E-Rock's angry reactions, and Opie's attempts at amends, culminating in paying E-Rock his estimated weight in quarters.  Brief clips of Mike Tyson were also included.


A lengthy interview with Mike Tyson followed, covering his sexual exploits (including unprotected sex with prostitutes in Brazil), difficulties maintaining relationships, self-destructive tendencies, his relationship with Cus D'Amato, challenges of fatherhood, violent childhood, bullying, career, and post-boxing life.  He mentioned his HBO film and book, "Undisputed Truth," and his experiences with Desiree Washington.  The interview included explicit language and sexually suggestive content.  The hosts also briefly discussed a humorous anecdote involving Uncle Paul and vinegar.

Finally, the show featured a graphically detailed and sexually explicit conversation between the hosts and Sam Roberts about the latter's childhood, focusing on intensely personal anecdotes about his penis and feet.  The hosts graphically described imagined scenarios involving smelling and manipulating Sam Roberts's genitals and feet, and recounted his late circumcision and resulting unusual urination experience.  The segment was filled with crude sexual humor, offensive language, and explicit descriptions of bodily functions.  The broadcast concluded with promotional information for the show and its affiliates.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shocking admission. James Lipton. A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him.  I was a tour guide. I would say, you want to see some sex?  Shit face buffoonery.  E-Rock drank all the Patron.  Everything is blurry.  And whatever this is.  Normally I get a couple of fingers up my ass.  What the fuck happened?  Old Pete Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  No.  Welcome. My name is E-Rock and we're up to day eight of the worst of 2013. 
[00:00:30]  For the Opie and Anthony show.  Eight days.  There's still two more days to come.  But we're on day eight.  Can I stress that enough?  Eight.  Anyway, we're looking back at the year that was for the Opie and Anthony program.  ONA show on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.  That follows everything that's going on with the Opie and Anthony show.  Until they return on January 6th, 2014.  Today's program.  Lots of good stuff.  Guillermo del Toro is in studio.  We look at the magic of Chris Angel and the Shaq Balloon.  Jenna Jameson makes a legendary appearance.  It's Bobo's in studio and he's getting a bath for some reason. 
[00:01:00]  We look at the highlights of Mayor Rob Ford from Toronto.  My cell phone number is given out on the air.  Opie pays for my vacation.  Mike Tyson returns to the show.  And we also take a look at the year that was for Uncle Paul.  But starting right now, in the year 2013, Anthony did something we never thought we would see him do.  He welcomed a new addition to the Cumia family.  He didn't get married.  He didn't have a kid.  He got a cat.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Man, this fucking kitten thing. 
[00:01:30]  Oh.  Been waiting all morning for this.  Well, I finally got a little kitten.  You know, during vacation and stuff.  Even before, I was kind of looking for a...  Friend.  A little friend.  For a pal to have around the house.  A little kitten.  And I wanted a little Bengal.  A little Bengal kitty.  They're, uh...  Are they hard to get?  Well, they're around, but, you know, to get a good one...  Well, he's just adorable. 
[00:02:00]  Oh.  Look, he's trying to steal my sunglasses.  My sunglasses.  My fucking blind man glasses.  How cute.  Isn't he just adorable?  That video better not go viral.  I'll tell you what the fuck.  He took your glasses off.  I know.  And he takes them completely.  He steals my glasses right off my face.  What a little scamp.  He is a scamp.  How many takes?  I need to know.  That was one take right there.  One take.  How cute.  You didn't try it a few more times?  No.  That's going to be a viral video.  Look, yeah.  I know it is.  Yes. 
[00:02:30]  Look, he gets them completely off.  Off my head.  Adorable kitten.  This is called adorable kitten.  Sees black person coming and doesn't want to hear the owner again.  Oh, there he goes.  What in the world?  He stole my glasses.  Doesn't he know those glasses are too big for his little head?  He can put those on.  And then he plays with them.  Can we play it again?  How cute.  Ant talks to the kitten.  He's playing.  Through it, I think.  Oh, great.  If he blinded you.  What a sable.  Where can they find this video? 
[00:03:00]  It's on YouTube.  On O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  That's my YouTube name on there.  O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  Yeah.  You son of a bitch.  I'm getting a fucking kitten today.  I don't really understand this.  Oh, I was getting texts.  Yeah.  Might ruin my viral ability.  Is there a purpose to this?  Viral centric.  You could have knocked that sound down on that. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, I know.  I just put it up.  I just posted it.  You were too excited.  I was like, oh, look, the kitty's doing something adorable.  I got to get this online immediately.  I understand.  He does.  He takes them right off my head.  You hear Seinfeld is on in the background, of course.  I don't really need those.  I don't really need these.  He's so cute.  They're yours, Scott.  Yeah, sure.  Why not? 
[00:04:00]  Enjoy.  Isn't he great?  Well, he's about, what, seven weeks old, I guess.  He's a real little guy.  Smaller than your head, I think.  He's so tiny.  Do you pet him a lot?  Yes.  Do you like it?  Yes.  He falls asleep right on my shoulder, under my neck.  Do you kiss his head?  On the couch.  Yes, he's got a little kitty head.  He's adorable.  Can I give you a slight tip?  Yeah, what's up?  If you add Anthony Cumia to your title, then you'll know who fucking retweets it and likes 
[00:04:30]  it.  Oh.  And then you get into the Twitter world a little better.  I didn't even realize.  I just...  That's the only reason why I do it on mine.  You know exactly who's fucking helping you out.  Oh.  I don't even pay attention.  Because if they like that, if they like that video and it says, at Anthony Cumia at the end  of it, then that hits Twitter that way.  Oh.  It's very smart.  I don't even know.  I'll show you.  I'll show you.  But anyway, go ahead.  So he's smaller than your hand? 
[00:05:00]  Well, no.  He's bigger than my hand, but he's pretty goddamn small.  Right.  He's a little guy.  And I picked him up during vacation in Oceanside.  There was a guy down there selling him.  So I picked one up.  Did you know who you were?  No.  No.  Just...  You know, like animal people are weird.  Was he creepy?  Yeah, he was a little creepy.  Did he go in the backyard and get to play with all of them and decide which one you wanted?  Old school?  Well, he came out... 
[00:05:30]  Remember those days?  How cool that was?  I know, right?  We used to do that with collies.  We'd go in the backyard somewhere and a whole shitload would jump all over you and then you  get to pick one.  But it wasn't outside.  He had this giant, like a big tray thing almost.  And he put all of them in there.  There were five of them.  Five.  There were five.  There were four males in one.  And I had to pick one.  Why did you take two?  Because I only want one cat.  No, you're going to have two.  No, I only want one cat.  Did you bang a little brother and sister?  No.  Clawing you together?  No. 
[00:06:00]  Doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly.  Was it heartbreaking when you could only take one, though?  Nah, right away I was kind of looking at that one because the colorings, the markings  are really nice.  And then it turns out to be really kind of fun and stuff.  And no, the other ones could go fuck themselves.  Really?  Yeah, I don't care.  Make fucking kitten stew out of them.  People don't like a big shit.  Here's what happened.  That was the one that cowered from him the least.  The others ran and hid.  Holy fuck, those other ones only have a few weeks left.  No, they're adorable. 
[00:06:30]  Their shelf life, isn't that long?  Oh, I wasn't getting them from the pound.  That's nice.  Yeah.  What's his name?  Beavis.  See, that's why you get it.  It's a little Beavis.  They took you to get a Beavis and a shithead.  That's why you're going to have a second one.  You've got to have the butthead now.  Everyone knows that.  I just want one.  Little cat.  This is what's going to happen.  Yeah.  It's going to not look like a kitten anymore.  Then you come and get your butthead as a kitten. 
[00:07:00]  No, I don't mind cats.  I've liked cats for years.  I've always, you know, for the most part, had one for many times.  Where does he sleep?  Well, over vacation, I was kind of sleeping on the couch and fucking outside and fucking inside.  What do you mean outside?  You can't sleep outside?  I sleep on the lounge chair sometimes.  For the night?  Yeah, if I'm like hanging out all night, it's warm out.  It's nice out.  Don't you get bit by mosquitoes?  Nah, I got like all kinds of gadgets and gizmos to keep them fuckers away. 
[00:07:30]  I got that propane fan fucking sucky vacuum.  Yeah, so, but I slept up in my room, and little Beavis was upstairs, too.  He would sleep on the pillow right above my head, and he would do the little meow-meow thing  to my hair.  You know, he'd be like...  Has he shit in your hair yet?  No.  Oh, God.  He wakes up with a head full of piss?  Yeah.  Oh, that would suck.  Welcome to my world. 
[00:08:00]  A little cat.  A little Beavis turns into an outdoor cat at that point.  Yeah, he...  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, he used the little cat box.  You know, I got that in one side of the house, so...  You can have him shit in the toilet.  I get one of those fucking...  Dude, they make this fucking automatic litter box thing.  Right.  Not the old-school one.  This is a new one.  It costs about 250 bucks.  It has granules in it that are reusable because it washes with water. 
[00:08:30]  It goes through a whole wash cycle.  After he pees and shits?  Well, no, you could set it for, like, every day or something, because it's a 30-minute  wash cycle.  Holy shit.  And this thing fucking scoops it.  The water goes around.  It fucking pulverizes the shit in a chamber and pumps it out.  That's amazing.  It's not getting rid of all the shit.  There's no way.  It does.  How?  It's crazy.  So, more about Little Beavis.  Oh, Little Beavis.  So, I had parties over the house, so I had to put Little Beavis upstairs in one of the 
[00:09:00]  rooms.  Wow, you don't trust people with your kitten?  It's so fucking small, it would get trot upon in a second.  Like, it's just too tiny.  There was a picture of Big A holding it, and it just was Lenny written all over it.  Fucking snap his little neck.  And then there's kids all over the place, so...  And they're just dumb when it comes to animals.  They, like, pick them up by the fucking head and shit like that.  So, they don't really have a good gist. 
[00:09:30]  That's a really cute picture.  That's Travis's daughter, Riley, with Little Beavis.  Isn't that Warren in the background, too?  Yeah, yeah.  And Warren.  And some fucking shining picture over the bed.  I see that.  Aw, what a little guy, fucking...  He's so little, poor little guy.  I want to hold him.  I want to pick him up.  Oh, yeah.  He would love it.  The second you pick him up, he grabs onto you.  There he is.  Look.  He's very tiny.  He's got little leopard spots.  Would he let me pet him?  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  He likes being petted.  Yeah.  There he's biting my ear right there.  Look how adorable.  See, that's how small he is.  Jesus.  My hand is like...  Yeah.  He is a very cute cat.  Oh, he's adorable.  And he follows me around all over the house.  He just walks around.  That has to be a viral video.  That fucking kitten taking your glasses.  My glasses.  How many views does that have right now?  A tranny did to me what a kitten did to you.  A kitten said, for wasting my time.  Well, I put it up at, what, two in the morning? 
[00:10:30]  This morning?  I think so.  Did you tweet it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they're like at 2 a.m.  It's already up to 3,100.  I haven't retweeted or anything.  It just takes to get onto one of those fucking sites.  One of those pet lunatic sites.  Where it's just like, oh, a kitty.  Kitty.  Yeah.  Get in trouble for those sites.  No, not that.  Oh.  Oh, there he is next to a bullet.  And he's very tiny. 
[00:11:00]  Holy shit.  Is that...  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  You got to put a gun in your kitten video.  You think I need a gun?  Yeah.  There's got to be a way.  You got to make a...  Hold it to his head.  You got to make a kitten video every week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What about it?  Just keep pumping him out.  You know, I'll...  I just retweeted the video.  Oh.  Sadly.  Thank you.  Sadly.  Sadly.  This fucking thing's going to go.  Oh, there he is.  He's yelling.  Do you think he has to get a viral video out of him? 
[00:11:30]  Yes.  Of course he is.  Yelling from behind the couch.  Well, you had one recently.  You've done the wrong with a good viral video.  Oh, boy, did I.  Jesus.  Hey, that's true, right?  My viral video came with a million death threats.  That was fun.  That's what you want.  Oh, man.  And then there's a couple of vines.  How much did Beavis cost you?  Thousands.  No, no.  Beavis was pretty cheap.  Why is he cheap?  Is that a tough breed to get?  No, not really.  A good one, you know, I didn't want one with, like, a lot of marbling on him. 
[00:12:00]  Apparently, you want one with, like, the spots.  What's marbling?  It's when the color is just kind of all, like, blotchy on him.  But I wanted the one with the spots so he looks like a leopard.  And then I got him before he got all of his shots, so I got to pay for the shots, so he put the price down for that.  What was it about?  It's like a grand.  Okay.  It's not that much.  You're going to get another one?  No.  Two cats are perfect.  Oh, there he is. 
[00:12:30]  I'm playing with his little nose.  Don't waste your viral videos with Vine, man.  No, if it's not viral, I'm just playing with his little nose.  Go right to the YouTube.  I was shook-a-shook-a.  All right, but we're licking your finger.  Yes.  Well, let's move that one to YouTube.  Oh, and then he jumps.  And he falls.  He jumps and tries to swat my finger, and he falls over because he's too tiny.  Oh, a little guy doesn't know how to proportion his body weight yet.  That asshole! 
[00:13:00]  He has no idea.  And this one, oh, look, he's playing with a little bracelet.  He's just biting.  He likes to play.  Here he is eating a big bunch of food.  I noticed that your angry tweets were drastically down, so.  You think it's helping?  I think the kitten is helping.  There's definitely a correlation between your angry tweets dropping and the fact that you've got this beautiful little kitten. 
[00:13:30]  You might have something there.  So let's get you a kitten every three months.  I think, um, let's get some of these.  These are horrible habits you're teaching it to.  Oh, I know.  Just going after, uh, as you try to tie your shoes and.  Yeah, he's going to go after your ding-a-ling one day.  Absolutely.  I used to play fight with my cat when he was a kitten.  It was cute, right, Sam?  Yeah, now he's about 20 pounds and just waits for somebody to come home so he can pounce.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he's like the fucking, like the fucking butler in, uh, Pink Panther, Asian Helper. 
[00:14:00]  Yes.  Keto.  He just likes his idea of a fun time as he sneaks up to you and you pet him, you know,  and he's like, oh, I'm just here for a cuddle, and then wraps his paws around you and sinks  his claws and teeth into your arm.  Oh, man.  Hard.  So I gotta stop that.  Yeah, I can't wait till this cuteness.  I gotta stop that.  Anthony's injured by this cuteness.  No.  And he's playing with his hands.  What are we supposed to do?  You can't let him, as a kitten, play with your hands as a toy, because then he becomes  an old cat, and he'll just start clawing at your hands when he sees them. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, but it's adorable.  Right now.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm teaching him all the wrong things.  I can't wait till you come in all scratched up.  The animal starts abusing you.  We were like, why is our cat so horrible?  And then I found this tape I had of when he was a kitten.  Yeah.  And we were just like, oh, look at him, he's so cute.  And we were letting him, like, bite our feet and all that.  And I go, yeah.  Oh, and then looking, yeah.  That's what happens.  Although, you know, Jack-Jack used to play like this as a kitten, and he was fine as  a grown-up cat. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Sort of.  Very cool.  Yeah.  I mean, you know.  It's cool.  I'm just watching his nails go into your leg, and I'm like, right now?  That's not my leg.  I don't know how much leg that is.  It's shaved.  Oh, well.  It could easily be yours.  Yeah.  That's a girl?  That's funny.  Yeah.  Nice boots.  The poor little kid.  How many times have you missed him since coming to work today? 
[00:15:30]  Not really.  You know, he's cool to have and stuff.  I like petting him.  I like shuka-shuka.  Why don't you bring him in?  I will after a while.  Yeah.  Why don't you let him run around here?  Let's fucking...  When he's little.  Don't want to get stepped on.  Well, put him in a little box or something.  You don't just bring him in all willy-nilly in your pocket.  You're fucking...  You know?  He's not the fucking mouse in Green Mile.  You fucking put him in a...  I'm in the jingles.  Yeah.  Bring him in a shoebox and bring him in.  Oh, I'll put it and look at it. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Continues right now.  Hit it now.  Now.  My name is E-Rock.  It is the Worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  And we welcome right now director, screenwriter, producer, Guillermo del Toro is in studio.  Promoting his new book, Cabinet of Curiosities. 
[00:16:30]  My Notebooks, Collections, and Other Obsessions.  He has a lot of cool collections, including monster memorabilia.  He has so much cool stuff.  Where does he keep it all?  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Let's get Guillermo del Toro in studio.  I'll go, Tomo.  He's promoting a book.  It's a giant book that smells really good.  Oh, yeah.  Here he comes.  Yes.  Cabinet of my...  Cabinet of Curiosities.  Cabinet of Curiosities. 
[00:17:00]  My Notebooks, Collections, and Other Obsessions.  Nice to meet you, sir.  Hey, hi.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Same here.  Big fan of your movies, sir.  I enjoyed Pacific Rim very much.  Oh, thank you.  Yes.  And I go into these movies sometimes and I'm like, all right, I don't know what this is  going to be about, but I hope for the best.  That was awesome.  It was like old school kind of Godzilla-ish vibe to it, but with amazing visuals. 
[00:17:30]  Thank you.  And the size that you portray with these robots were great.  I thought it was a fun movie to watch.  We spent three years on it.  Wow.  And it was really, if you ask me, I spent 38 years wanting to make it.  Oh, really?  I mean, it's a movie that is so attuned with my 10-year-old, you know, like, self.  Yeah, yeah.  It was, and inside every guy there is a 10-year-old constantly.  Uh-huh.  You remain that kid.  And hopefully the movie reminds you of what it is to be that. 
[00:18:00]  What were you watching back then?  Sci-fi movies and things like that?  Oh, yeah.  I was a completely freaky kid.  Yeah, yeah.  So was there a lot of Godzilla movies?  Everything.  In Mexico, I was born in 64, so I came in right at the height of the giant monster movie.  Yeah, yeah.  It was when Godzilla was king.  I went to opening day of many Godzilla films.  Oh, yeah.  What was it?  Remember, Destroy All Monsters came out?  One of the best.  Ghidra and Rodan and Gamera. 
[00:18:30]  Those were the ones I liked.  The more monsters.  Yeah, the better, right?  It's like wrestling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You have the good wrestlers and the bad wrestlers, except they are throwing tanks at each  other, buildings at each other.  I thought the Gargantuans didn't get enough credit.  That is perhaps one of my two favorites.  War of the Gargantuans was a really good movie, too.  Yeah.  The way they moved the hair on their bodies and made it look like real people.  It was just a good one.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a good one.  And what a lot of people don't know is that it's a sequel to another movie that is lesser  known called Frankenstein Conquers the World. 
[00:19:00]  Really?  Yeah.  And when I was a kid, that movie opened in a tiny cinema in my hometown.  I took the bus.  It took me an hour to get to the cinema.  I sat down to see War of the Gargantuans.  In the middle of the movie, somebody throws a big glass of pee from the balcony.  It lands on my head.  Come on.  Here's how much I liked it.  That made you love the movie, I hope.  No, no, no.  Here's how much I loved it.  I stayed.  Wow.  You stayed with pee on your head.  I came out with a sort of something about Mary hairdo. 
[00:19:30]  Why did they throw pee?  It was never established?  Well, it's established as a very, it was back then a very favored prank in the movie.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  We used to just do soda.  We weren't brave enough to not pay.  Yeah, Northport, remember?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Throwing soda.  The balconies, yeah.  But that theater I went to is what they used to call in Mexico, they used to call it a  one-brick theater, because they gave you one brick for the rats.  One brick.  Not a reputable. 
[00:20:00]  Right, right.  So you're helping out as an exterminator while you're watching the movie.  You're doing your duty, yeah.  That was like the golden age of those movies.  Of all horror and fantasy.  Yeah, yeah.  And they were all, they all seemed to be like 90 minutes long.  Like it was an hour and a half.  That's all you needed.  As frankly, every movie should be.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Except, but we seem to have a hard time controlling the past two hours.  Pacific Rim was dead on two hours and 30 something seconds. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But back then you have, in TV you were watching all the Universal Monster movies.  In theaters you have Kaijus and Hammer movies.  Christopher Lee.  Oh, yeah, the best.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought those were, they had a horrifying element to them.  Hammer film.  I thought he was the best Dracula, Christopher Lee.  With the bleeding eyes.  Yeah, his eyes would bleed.  Oh, it was so creepy.  As a kid you would really get like scared.  And he had a power that, you know, was not creaky.  It was like, this guy could not only absolutely suck the damsels, but he would kick your ass. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He looked like a, like he would, I was a great fighter.  There was something about going to the movies back then that was such a, now you just kind  of, it's an aside.  You know, you could have a movie you really want to go see, but it was like as a kid when  you went to the movies theater to go see it, because it was something, first of all, you  knew you were not going to see this movie again.  If, again, if, if not ever, it was going to be years if, if you ever saw it again.  So you had to pay attention and soak it all in and enjoy it. 
[00:21:30]  Back then, I remember one of the big things was if you were able to steal a movie poster.  Oh, yeah.  If you liked the movie a lot, you would steal a movie poster.  But, and the only way you could memorialize the movie was by buying, buying the soundtrack  on an LP.  Yeah, yeah.  So they, they were, they were special moments.  Yeah.  And now it's easy to just, you know, you get on demand.  It's one of your entertainment options.  Right.  One of the many.  Yeah.  Do you like the remakes and stuff of Godzilla?  Well, you know, I really, I really don't mind remakes if they're good. 
[00:22:00]  Every remakes or original movies, if they're crappy, it doesn't make a difference.  No, no.  They kind of go away.  Remakes are great.  What do you think that they miss?  Sometimes it feels like there's, there's something that they don't quite capture and I don't  know exactly what it is.  Sometimes the remakes.  Man, I don't know, man.  I can't even put my finger on what this is.  Because some of the, I think it's nostalgia, really.  I think it's.  Because some of these movies don't look as impressive as what obviously you're doing nowadays.  If you rewatch them, that was the thing with Pacific Rim. 
[00:22:30]  I wanted to make the movie for a new generation of kids.  I wanted the 10-year-olds now to see Pacific Rim and feel what I felt back then.  Right, right.  It was not an exercise in nostalgia.  It was, I would say, reinterpretation if you want, or passing the torch to a new generation.  You could definitely see the monsters, they were influenced by the monsters of the 60s.  Of course.  They were very strange looking.  Sometimes you couldn't really get a grasp on what they even were.  This one's half lobster.  It was, it really did. 
[00:23:00]  And it conjured up those memories of watching old monster movies like that.  I, I, I, there's, there's a great anecdote about the, the first Godzilla, which is 1954.  Oh, yeah.  With Raymond Burr, where they threw him in.  In the American version.  Yeah, yeah.  But the director, Shiro Honda, called everybody into his kitchen before starting the movie.  And he said, I'm making a movie.  We're making this movie for real.  We're not being funny about it.  We're not, everybody take it seriously.  And that's the way we went on Pacific Rim. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  There was no postmodern wink.  All these things are funny.  We were, we were doing it for real.  Yeah.  We were doing it to be an exciting, seriously entertaining.  It was good.  You felt like there was that element of impending danger and doom was there and the heroics and stuff.  It was, no, I, I really, I watched that and went like, wow, that was really fun to watch.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  What's your least favorite?  Did you have a least favorite horror or creature that you just, like, you just couldn't quite get into?  You mean when you were a kid?  Yeah.  You know, I like, I have the most brotherly love for monsters. 
[00:24:00]  I love, I love crappy monsters.  I love great monsters.  Even the crappy ones.  And sometimes the most charming ones are the crappy ones.  The ones that they look like they need your help.  They're so crappy.  A little poor thing, you gotta feel bad for them.  That poor giant clawed alien needs my help.  You do feel like that.  That's funny.  And your book is a really, it's a really interesting, giant, beautiful book. 
[00:24:30]  And it's called, it's called Cabinet of Curiosity.  It's my notebooks, collections, and other obsessions.  What exactly is it?  These are all just notes you've made?  These have, these have all my notebooks from all my movies.  And they are, they are, these are my notebooks.  You know, I, I draw on them.  This is for Pacific Rim.  These are my actual drawings.  That is amazing right there.  So, this is my handwriting, my drawings.  And it also, it also includes my, my, my collection, which is, in, in 2005, I was hanging a picture of one. 
[00:25:00]  I collect original art and artifacts and props and books and all that.  And my wife said, you can hang that in there, in the kitchen.  And I, I thought, I spent my entire life as a kid under my mother.  And now, my wife's telling me what I can and cannot do.  So, I said, look, you know what?  I'm going to buy my own house.  So, I went and bought my own house.  And, and, uh.  That's what Jimmy's going to have to do.  It's 10,000 square feet of collection.  Some of it, which is in the book.  Wow. 
[00:25:30]  Basically, what I do is I, I live with my wife and my daughters.  Every day in the morning, I go to my own house.  That's awesome.  I spend, I spend the day in my house.  Right.  And I can do whatever I want in my house.  Right, right.  Hang whatever monster picture, whatever.  And, and the funny thing is, uh, it took me 40 something years to live the way I thought  I should live at age 10.  Now, what, that's an amazing, what, what is something you collected that you absolutely  love, a piece of movie, um, memorabilia?  I have truly, it's a museum. 
[00:26:00]  And if you browse through the book, you'll see it.  I mean, it's, it's really quite an amazing collection.  And I have, uh, basically what I do with every check, when I make any money, I, I, uh, immediately  give my wife half and I said, we'll, we'll share the expenses on the house.  And the other half don't ask me anything.  I'm going to do whatever.  And you're, you cannot tell me how much did that monster cost?  How much did this, the house has secret passages?  Wow.  Really?  It has two secret passages, has one book, one room that is called the rain room, which 
[00:26:30]  is a room that is rigged for out to have a fake outside where it's a thunderstorm 24  hours a day.  This is great.  We're looking at right now, there's a room, a beautiful wood room with like, you can see  the upstairs balcony with a giant Frankenstein head on it.  And there's a, um, I don't recognize the, uh, the Hellboy monster, sorry, underneath on  the, uh, the, the ground and there's a regular nice rug that every house should have.  And there's just creatures all over and there's a, there's 560 pieces of original art, all 
[00:27:00]  fantastic art.  Just up on this one landing, I'm saying like you got a Geiger over here and then the Hellboy.  Those are originals.  And, and, and then what's the pinhead, uh, girl here from freaks, from freaks.  Yeah.  I live, what I wanted to do as a kid is live with my heroes of horror.  And if you turn the page, that's, that's HP Lovecraft, a horror writer that I admired  as a kid.  I hadn't made life size.  So he lives in the house.  Like a wax museum type of, uh, but they're all around. 
[00:27:30]  Like there's a dwarf with a razor blade at the end of a corridor.  I call him my, my alarm system.  Wow.  I got to ask you about your other house though.  How boring is the other house?  Entirely vanilla.  Really?  Like there's nothing that indicates I'm there.  Do you have people come here?  I give tours like once a week.  He doesn't like people in his house.  This is your space.  Like people would try touching shit and wrecking it.  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm very careful.  Like I was fortunate.  I was blessed with two daughters, which means they are very careful. 
[00:28:00]  If I had a boy.  Right.  Half of my collection.  You'd run around trying to play with everything.  What is this?  Crack.  Yeah.  Does your wife go to the other house?  You know, she comes now and then.  I love this.  I get, I get the occasional conjugal visit.  But in reality is, is there, they're separate and I.  So you guys, you guys have an understanding, obviously.  It's your thing and you really are into it.  And she, you know, lets you do it.  People, normal, normal people go to work at 9 a.m. 
[00:28:30]  Come back at 5.  I do the same.  I mean, I live with my wife and my daughters.  But that's like kind of going to the office.  Instead of the office, you go to your house.  It's a great place.  I work there.  Oh, that you work.  Yeah.  It's a great atmosphere.  I'm sure.  That's where I write.  That's where I design the movies.  Do you ever get creeped out?  Not creeped out, but like turn around and go, huh, something's there.  There was.  I mean, I've had a few ghost experiences.  Really?  In my life for real.  You know, I'm a skeptic.  People think I believe all this crap.  Right, right.  I don't. 
[00:29:00]  I'm normally a skeptic.  That's me at age 10.  Well, give us a...  Oh, man.  But I bought two cabinets from the 15th century.  And they arrived to the house and they came with a ghost.  Really?  The house was sort of haunted for about a year and a half until I had a cleansing done.  Oh, you had a cleansing done?  Yeah, I had the cleansing.  Was it too much?  What were they doing?  Lights would be turned on and off.  Footsteps.  I just didn't.  And now I stay there.  I mean, I stay there sometimes until 2 a.m., 3 a.m. 
[00:29:30]  And I didn't like being creeped out.  Yeah, of course.  The cleansing worked?  Yeah, it did.  It did.  Wow.  My mother did it.  My mother is sort of a white witch.  You're a fascinating man.  Yeah, we're an interesting life.  Oh, my God.  I love it.  How far is your house from your other house?  About five minutes.  A five-minute ride.  A five-minute drive?  Yeah.  Yeah, you couldn't be like, yeah, I'm in L.A.  and my house is in New York.  No.  Do you sleep in this house once in a while?  No. 
[00:30:00]  When I come back, like right now we're shooting in Toronto.  I'm shooting the pilot for a horror series for FX based on my books, The Strain.  And when I go back to L.A., I don't go back to the family house.  I go back to my monsters.  Right.  And my wife and daughter stay in Toronto.  I go back.  Does your wife check up on you?  Going, sure, he likes monsters.  I'm too freaky to do anything.  Why do you know?  This is your internet porn.  This is your internet porn.  This is it, man.  This is it.  This is your obsession. 
[00:30:30]  I want to go to this house and look around.  This is great, man.  What's the address to the house if I'm going to stop behind and have your coordinates?  No, what is great about the house is, honestly, I walk in and I have a smile instantly.  Yeah.  You know, because when you're a kid, you're very particular about your room.  You know, every kid has the sign on the door, keep out.  Yeah, yeah.  Right outside the room.  It's basically that.  It's a space where no one can tell you what to do.  Let me tell you a little personal story, Guillermo.  Not to the extent that you have done, but I was laughed at relentlessly at the beginning 
[00:31:00]  of the summer because I decided I wanted to buy a life-size Velociraptor to put up on  my jacuzzi.  Why not?  I did it and people laughing, oh, what the hell are you doing?  It looks great.  It looks cool.  The steam comes up from the jacuzzi.  You put on a red light and you're having a little jacuzzi in Jurassic Park.  And everyone laughs, but then when they come over, they're snapping pictures with it like  crazy. 
[00:31:30]  Absolutely.  So they want a picture with it.  A hundred percent.  In the book, there is, you know, my car.  When I was a kid, I saw this movie called The Car with James Brolin.  A horror movie where the car was the devil.  Great design by Chuck Barrett who designed the Batmobile.  Fell in love with it.  I said, I'm going to own that car.  I own that car.  You own the car from the car.  I had it made, I had it made, handmade in Mexico in steel.  It's like a tank.  It's in the book.  No doubt.  But it is, I think that all you can do is live the way you want to live. 
[00:32:00]  Right, right.  Yeah.  Otherwise you have nothing.  I remember that movie, but I was getting confused with, um, with, uh, Duel for a minute.  Duel with the truck.  They're the two scariest cars in the history of the car.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dennis Weaver.  He was good in that.  But, uh, that car goes like, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Had, like, a very scary horn.  Yeah.  And what you were saying about your Velociraptor.  I take the car only on Sundays because it's too expensive. 
[00:32:30]  If I go, bourbon come back, it's one tank.  Oh.  Each way.  Because it's so heavy.  It weighs a ton.  Yeah, a ton more than a ton.  So I take it around the block, go buy ice cream.  Like an old man, you know.  That's crazy.  Some people are snapping pictures.  Can I take a picture of your car?  See, this is the life you're supposed to lead when you're a successful guy.  I love it.  That notebook, he opened it up briefly.  It's really cool.  It's beautiful.  You know what it reminded me of when you opened it?  It really is.  It looks like Indiana Jones' father's notebook for the Holy Grail. 
[00:33:00]  It is.  Well, it started like very much like a field notebook.  Uh-huh.  And then I have three of them right now.  And they turned into this, you know.  That has got kind of a Lord of the Rings look to it there.  They are old notebooks that I bought in Venice in 1997.  And they were handmade.  That's great.  Yeah, leather and stuff.  Are those notebooks, is it one per movie?  Or do you just keep going until it's done?  No, no.  They are mixed.  Like, for example, the section that I seal off is sealed off because I have designs from  The Hobbit. 
[00:33:30]  Right, right.  Which I was in charge of directing that movie.  And I can't allow them to be seen or this and that.  Yeah, yeah.  So I seal them with my little band.  It's one rubber band.  I don't accidentally.  Keeping the secrets from The Hobbit.  It is.  It is low-key, low-tech.  Yeah, yeah.  No, it works.  You can't lose a thumb drive or anything.  It's your notebook.  There's no way they can hack into the rubber band.  Can't hack the notebook.  Hack into a rubber band.  Let's grab it.  Let's grab it.  Look over there for a second. 
[00:34:00]  I can ask you about your father.  He was kidnapped.  Oh, yeah, 98.  Wow.  Wow.  He was in Mexico?  Yeah, he was in Mexico.  He was 72 days.  They kept him.  72 days.  Wow.  Was it a cartel?  No, it was.  The kidnapping, the way the kidnappings are run is they're basically run like franchise.  Wow.  So one person can run two, three kidnappings and run them like convenience stores.  You know, they call, they have a guy that picks up the victim, a guy that negotiates.  It was, back then in 98, it was just a business. 
[00:34:30]  Now it's rampant.  Wow.  Now it's all sort of melded into one single crime.  The guys that do the kidnapping, do the organ traffic, do the drug peddling, everything.  Wow.  So they kidnap you.  Dad, you got a phone call and said.  Oh, we got many phone calls, yeah.  And you knew it was true immediately?  Oh, yeah.  No, the first phone call I got was my older brother called and said, better come home.  He said they took him. 
[00:35:00]  He didn't say anything else.  And I knew what it was instantly.  Wow.  I didn't have an explanation.  Where did they get him?  They got him outside his business, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, it was.  And was it random?  No, no.  You know, they planned it for, those things are planned carefully.  And a lot of the time, they need to know where they're picking him up, what time, what time he arrives.  I'm sure they want to know if you have money, too, at that point.  They do the background, and, you know, they do the check with finances. 
[00:35:30]  It's a business.  Wow.  They don't want to invest.  Uh-huh.  So they got him, and then you get the call, and what's the process then?  You have to get the money together, or do you try to negotiate?  I tell you this, there's only one time where three-quarters of the way Hollywood got it right, there's a movie called Proof of Life with Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe.  Three-quarters of the way, if you can imagine, instead of Meg Ryan, a fat Mexican. 
[00:36:00]  And instead of Russell Crowe, an old English guy.  That's the way it is.  You have to bring a negotiator.  The negotiator has to guide you through it, because there's a whole protocol.  If you do it on your own, you're going to screw it up.  What, what's something that somebody would do on their own that the negotiator would protect you from?  Look at Jerry Lundegaard.  Everything, everything you do instinctively is wrong.  Really?  Like what?  There's a whole protocol.  For example, if you, if you, if you know your limit, and you immediately declare it, and you say, that's what I can get, you're telling them how much you can get now. 
[00:36:30]  So they're going to run the negotiation for longer, to give an example.  Well, we, we said we can only get X, which was a fraction of what they were asking for.  But that told them, if they can get X, the second day we called, that means if we wait for 72 days.  Oh man, they're going to be able to scrape up more.  Ten times odd.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  But instinctively, you give it your all, because you want him back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a, it's a really, I don't recommend it.  Man, right?  So was he taken care of for 72 days, more or less?  Well, you know, my dad is, I'm sure like your dad, it's a generation that doesn't talk.  Well, Jesus, Hopi.  It's a generation that doesn't like to chat about life.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He is, he was a self, he's a self-made man.  Right.  So he doesn't talk about it really.  What happened?  Like my dad, my dad and I, we can go, yep, yep. 
[00:37:30]  For two hours, but basically that's, and I don't see him for three years and then we're  going, yep, how are you?  Good, good.  Did he get security after that?  You know, he did for a while, but now he jokes about it, but it's true.  He says, I'm too old for that.  I mean, they won't kidnap him because he could croak.  Yeah, there's a problem.  There's a problem.  I mean, they only kidnap people that they can keep.  Do you worry when you go to Mexico about?  I take precaution.  Yeah, okay.  You have to, right?  Now I have to. 
[00:38:00]  I have to, especially because in my line of business, people assume, let's say that  a movie, Pacific Rim, made $400 million.  That you have $400 million?  People think he must have at least 50.  Not true.  Not true.  Not true.  You have to move the decimal points a few days.  Yeah, yeah.  That's fascinating, man.  Wow.  That is really scary.  What a monkey wrench to throw into someone's life.  So you don't like going out of Mexico, I would assume.  Do I like? 
[00:38:30]  I love going.  But you wish you would.  I have to go with precautions.  I cannot go casually.  And you're not going to film there anymore, I bet.  I can't.  That's the biggest loss for me is family life and the fact that I would love to continue  filming Mexican film.  All the rabble in Toronto.  Let me tell you, that's dangerous living right there.  You might sleep yourself to death.  No, it's such a great life right now.  I actually like Canada.  I adore Toronto.  It's a lot of fun up there. 
[00:39:00]  We were in Montreal.  This is a beautiful book.  It's got notes in it.  We spent three and a half years making the book.  So many great pictures, photographs, and artwork in here.  Stories behind everything about all the movies.  It's in my car.  Oh, wow.  There it is.  It says it.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  I just saw that, too.  That's great.  It looks like a Rolls Royce.  It is like the evil twin of a phantom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's gorgeous.  And you're directing The Hobbit.  I was prepping The Hobbit for two years as director, and we had so much delays that 
[00:39:30]  I left, and obviously Peter and Philippa and Fran saw the movie to completion, and Peter  directed it beautifully.  But I was so happy being part of it.  I'm part of the screenplay.  Oh, you're not preparing for the next one?  No, no, no.  Oh, I thought you were preparing for the next one.  Peter directed them, yeah.  Beautiful.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm looking forward to the next installment.  Coming up, yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Great anticipation.  Is that directed already?  The second one, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The solution is not.  Okay.  I didn't realize that.  I thought they were working on it.  Yeah, Dragon opens his eyes, and we all get shut out.  I know.  What the heck?  Credit time.  Now sit and wait your best.  Yeah, yeah.  For a year.  Yeah, yeah.  That's just mean.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  That's just mean.  It goes back, though, to something we were talking about earlier with the movies, and you  knew you weren't going to see them again on television and stuff.  When a movie came out, and then you heard there was going to be a sequel, that was amazingly  exciting. 
[00:40:30]  I remember Planet of the Apes, and then Beneath the Planet of the Apes was coming out, and  I was like, oh my God.  Those were my Star Wars.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Amazing, right?  We were there opening day.  Yep.  And I was of the right age where Beneath the Planet of the Apes struck me even harder  than Planet of the Apes.  Yeah, I wonder what that was all about.  Well, those bald, creepy bastards worshipping the bomb.  Yeah.  It was so fucking edgy for that.  That was kind of creepy, and then Charlton Heston buying it at the end was kind of weird, 
[00:41:00]  you know.  Very weird.  Kill him off like that.  Spoiler.  Spoiler alert.  1968 or whatever the hell.  For those that they would have trouble catching up, there you are.  But that was a movie that had one of those amazing reveals at the end, Planet of the Apes  with, of course, the Statue of Liberty and stuff.  You did it, yeah.  That was, because you just, if you just walked into that movie and didn't know, you didn't  know.  At all.  Until the end.  You were fooled.  No, and that was, that was what was great, and I'm not nostalgic about it, but what was 
[00:41:30]  great about media being so subdued back then is that you didn't know.  You didn't know.  I didn't know this thing.  It's like me when I go to a sports movie.  I don't know, because I'm a fat slum.  I have no idea.  I went, I went to see, I went to see Ron Howard's Rush.  Right, yeah.  And my wife knew more about car racing than me.  She was like, oh, wait until this happens.  I go, is it going to happen?  I said, I hope he, I hope he does all right. 
[00:42:00]  He said, you don't know?  What kind of man are you?  I don't know.  Yeah, what kind of man are you?  He's like, shut up.  I'm going back to my monster house.  My only sport is cappuccino lifting.  I do nothing else.  I compress 500.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, you're brilliant.  I got to tell you, what a pleasure having you here.  Thank you.  I love that you have a monster house.  Big fan.  It's two of them now.  Now you got a second one.  What about the second house? 
[00:42:30]  Next door.  And the neighbors think I do porn because all the, all the windows are black.  Yeah.  So they, they think, and they say, is it true that you, I was taking the trash out and they  said, is it true that you're a porn producer?  I said, no.  No.  I'm a director.  Yeah.  Monster porn.  You had to get a second house for your collection.  I was watching vigilantly the neighbors and I was keeping track of, of what was going  on.  And right when I saw their kid moving to college, I knock on the door and I go, Hey, I'm your 
[00:43:00]  next door neighbor.  I think he was telling me, they said, as a matter of fact, we were putting the house  off next week.  Wow.  So I logged out.  Wow.  Buys both houses.  That's fantastic.  That's awesome.  Guillermo del Toro.  Again, thanks so much for coming in.  Very, very fun.  The worst is yet to come.  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013. 
[00:43:30]  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  Continues right now.  Hi, my name is E-Rock.  It is the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  We're moving into the Criss Angel segment.  Once again, we revisit the magic of Criss Angel.  And we don't understand why nobody takes him seriously.  I mean, we're watching a clip right now of him levitating Shaquille O'Neal.  And we're trying to break it down and figure out how the hell does he do it?  This also coins the term shock balloon.  ONA's worst of 2013. 
[00:44:00]  Look, I will give fucking David Blaine kudos and props, as they say.  That's right.  Compared to the ultimate hack that is Criss Angel.  Yeah, that guy sucks.  Criss Angel, it's gotten to the point now where it's like a fake show about a magician.  His show.  Are you been watching still?  Oh yeah, I was watching last night.  They had like a fucking, like a marathon going on.  Yeah.  It's pretty much boiled down to anyone can do this if you have a camcorder and some family 
[00:44:30]  and friends.  What you do is you gather people around that you obviously know or are paid or family and  friends.  You have a camera and you become proficient in editing because that's all that's going  on now.  No, it's not.  With Criss Angel.  He has people there that go, oh!  And he probably does all those reaction shots separately.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he edits.  You need a good, oh!  He did something last night I was watching, and of course he's trying to be like socially  conscious, and it's this homeless guy, and he's wheeling his shopping cart full of junk, 
[00:45:00]  and he's got a coat on top, a winter coat, and Criss Angel, he pulls up the fucking coat  and he goes, oh, winter coat here, oh, this looks warm, maybe you need something a little  lighter though because it's not that warm out.  Now, he walks up to the camera with the coat and blocks the camera with the coat, and then  comes away and puts the coat over the shopping cart and pulls it away real fast, and it's  full of food for the homeless guy. 
[00:45:30]  Fuck yeah!  That's magic!  And the homeless guy's going, thank you, thank you!  Oh, Christ.  And they block out his face and stuff, but it's some black guy.  And of course the thank you, thank you is because someone just wheeled a shopping cart filled  with food in front of him.  He's an actor.  Oh, they don't even...  No, that's God!  That's the point I'm making, it's not even magic anymore.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, I gotta break this down.  So the homeless guy...  Is an actor.  And you can tell he's an actor.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:46:00]  So why would you do the same trick?  Because it's all editing.  Yeah.  Where you get the homeless guy, and you just wheel a cart of food in front of him, you're  gonna get the, oh my God, thank you so much, and then you do the fake bullshit,  magic trick shit, edit it nice, and then you got...  An obvious homeless guy reacted to that.  They don't put that much work into it.  I'll tell you why, because a real homeless guy probably doesn't do a good take two and  three.  Yeah, that's true.  No, you don't need a take two or three.  If you wheel up a cart of brand new food, he doesn't even know he's part of a magic trick, 
[00:46:30]  he's just gonna freak out that you're giving him food.  But I mean, if you don't get the camera angle, then the homeless guy, you have to mic  him.  He smells.  He wants to put the mic on a stinky guy.  It's the disappearing...  So this is a Criss Angel type trick?  The magic that WhoKid pulled off on his Instagram?  Yeah.  That's pretty amazing with WhoKid.  That's more amazing than what David Blaine does, okay?  No, it's not.  Who's worse, David Blaine or Criss Angel?  Criss Angel.  Oh, God, Criss Angel.  One billion percent.  That magic.  Criss Angel is the worst magician I've ever seen.  I think at this point... 
[00:47:00]  The worst?  The worst!  Worse than like a birthday party magician.  Yes!  He's horrible.  Horrible!  At this point, I just want to see Penn and Teller.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not a magic guy anymore.  I can't stand the shitty tricks that he wore.  But he doesn't even care.  He doesn't even care.  And then I realized maybe Criss Angel was never good.  Can we see a Criss Angel trick?  Find a Criss Angel trick from this show.  Fuck yeah. 
[00:47:30]  I like what you do with your hands when you say that.  You gotta believe it's very mysterious.  He levitates the...  Remember Shaq Attack?  He levitates him.  Oh, Shaq Attack.  Yes, I remember Shaq Attack.  He's the genie from fucking...  Kazam.  Kazam.  That's what it was.  This is fucking...  He levitated himself like on a flying carpet or something.  Watch this.  He called me out for years in the press to levitate him.  Levitate him.  Levitate him.  So I'll do it if you want to see it right now. 
[00:48:00]  He called you out in the press for years, did he?  Why is that the white lady playing basketball?  You have to agree to this.  Oh, all right.  Let's do it.  Well, he's there.  So of course he agreed to it already.  I'm gonna lay down and relax.  What the fuck?  Horrible version of the fucking...  He doesn't want us to see.  This is the official version.  It's on his website.  What?  It's a mess.  All right.  Go back.  Hold on.  He's probably levitating Shaq.  See?  He's floating.  Oh my God.  How fake is that? 
[00:48:30]  That's fucking magic.  Look at the people pointing and go...  Oh.  That's Carrot Top.  He's floating in mid-air.  That's magic.  He's not floating in the air.  Yes, he is.  Look at that, you piece of garbage.  He's magic.  Flavor Flav.  Flavor Flav is as stupid as a rock, so...  He's...  You'd think it'd be easy to pull the wool over Flavor Flav.  Yeah.  He might have wanted to get someone a little more impressive. 
[00:49:00]  By the way, the Shaq balloon, because it's obvious a Shaq balloon.  Look at...  It started moving like a balloon.  They didn't even edit that part out.  The Shaq balloon.  That's what it is.  I didn't realize what that was.  Of course it's a Shaq balloon.  You're not even saying that's Shaq himself.  No.  It is Shaq.  He's floating.  And look, they have so much glare from the sun on that shot.  You can tell that it's a Shaq balloon.  It's a...  His face isn't moving.  It's a fake Shaq.  No, it's not.  That's Shaquille O'Neal. 
[00:49:30]  He's floating, you piece of garbage.  Now look.  Now they just have him laying on the ground.  And look at all the people.  They're like, wow.  But they saw the whole fucking camera cut bullshit.  He floated him over the house.  I just seen it.  He did not chip.  You're an idiot.  Flavor Flavs is there.  How in the world did Criss Angel get shot off the ground?  Well, that's a little tough for you, sir.  Maybe start with your ABCs. 
[00:50:00]  You can fly babies over the house.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  Right into your window.  He's the best illusionist in the world.  Chris, you are f***ing amazing.  Fuck yeah.  That's the most amazing thing I ever saw in my life.  Oh my God.  These guys have to f***ing do that for Criss Angel?  I'm going to ask Chris, can I be next?  Shaq, everybody!  You are.  You're all the way up there.  Look, they're talking to each other in the background like, oh, did you see that?  It's all fake.  What better way to celebrate than what my friends and family, all here to witness, my attempt to levitate Shaq. 
[00:50:30]  That's right.  Shaq balloon.  It's obviously a Shaq balloon.  It's a levitate Shaq balloon.  Somebody's got a remote control.  Well, go back to it.  He's got a long shirt on that doesn't f***ing move.  That's hilarious.  Oh shit, Shaquille is floating.  You didn't know that's what it was?  No, I didn't know it was a Shaq balloon.  It's such a Shaq balloon.  You could tell.  They don't show his face.  You're going to be able to tell in a second here.  The sun is glimmering so you can't get a look at it. 
[00:51:00]  But he used a shot where he blows it because it starts moving like a balloon.  It's coming up.  Right here.  See?  Shaq balloon.  He can't even pick the right shots in post to make it look believable.  Or is it a green screen?  No, it's Shaq balloon.  No, that's a Shaq balloon.  And you can tell when it's coming back down.  You're right.  It's Shaq balloon.  That's why they were like, we have to make you unconscious for this because you're not going to be moving. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Because it's a Shaq balloon.  Right there you can tell it's a Shaq balloon as well.  And everyone else there knows it's Shaq balloon.  Right.  Except Flava Flav.  Flav's tricked.  And then the old, as old as when, yeah.  And now he's on the ground and it's Shaq again.  That's like when the three stooges would fall off a building and the dummies would hit the fucking ground.  And then they'd be like, oh, shake their head.  Dude in one take with one camera.  Yeah.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  I've seen it.  Chris Angel is horrible. 
[00:52:00]  He's Shaq balloon.  He's got a huge oversized t-shirt on.  It's not moving at all while he's in the air.  He's floating.  So bad.  David Blaine kicks his ass.  It's real.  No, it's not.  I think the Shaq balloon actually, though, is clever.  I'll give him that much.  Uh-huh.  But I think we've said it in the past.  His presentation stinks.  Yeah.  It's clever to come up with the Shaq balloon.  Shaq balloon.  But there's a better way to do it.  I bet it's behind the house.  It's not in front of people if he's got to do it. 
[00:52:30]  And Shaq goes back there and then Shaq balloon comes above the roof.  And why wouldn't you have Shaq balloon just keep going?  Yeah, yeah.  Really fuck people up.  Shaq balloon.  It's like, we lost Shaq balloon.  Oh, no.  Shaq, come back.  Just a speck in the sky way up there.  That'd be hilarious.  That would be good.  And then you find Shaq deflated in a river somewhere.  Ask, uh, well, it's...  Yeah, they find a deflated Shaq miles away.  Stuck in tree branches.  On some power line just in the breeze. 
[00:53:00]  I'm a huge fan of Shaq balloon.  Ah, I want Shaq balloon.  I'm going to get Shaq balloon for my kid's next birthday party.  What happens if Shaq balloon and hit power chords while they were filming?  He's just got horrified people.  Well, Naina would have sang about it.  A 99 Shaq balloon.  That would be a good one.  Oh, God.  Hey, does Penn stay up late?  Let's call Penn and see if he'll explain Shaq balloon for us.  Oh, that's...  Because then you get a little fishing wire or something,  and you get some balloon operators, right? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  It's just hard.  But they blew it with the one shot,  because you see the balloon kind of go...  It did a wobble.  It did a balloon wobble.  A little wobble.  But his big, you know, flowing shirt didn't move at all through the whole thing.  Terrible.  He's the worst.  I bet Penn's got respect for David Blaine, though.  Hell no.  David Blaine's a fucking man.  Penn understands this shit.  Criss Angel is a piece of garbage.  He's a piece of shit.  You're a piece of garbage.  Here we go.  He's magic.  You might want to leave the room, Sam,  because we're going to fucking blow up your pal there. 
[00:54:00]  Go ahead, Cullen.  Give Sam some reality right now.  All right.  Go ahead, Cullen.  All right.  Cullen.  Whatever the fuck you...  Yeah, how you doing?  What's your name?  Cullen.  All right.  So what did I do wrong?  Cullen.  We met...  No, who is this?  Criss Angel or David Blaine?  I didn't even notice anyone in the studio.  Holy shit.  It's Criss Angel.  Criss Angel's in the studio.  What's up?  No, we met...  We met you down in New Orleans. 
[00:54:30]  You were doing Tricks with Quarters?  Tricks with Quarters.  Yes, sure.  Which one did you like?  He's gone.  Well, I'm glad I got my dose of reality from that dude.  He was going to say that there's a whole crowd around, and I think it was David Blaine,  and David Blaine pushed this particular crowd out to bring in his own crowd.  His own crowd.  Well, obviously, this guy's a fucking idiot who can't work a phone, so... 
[00:55:00]  He could be as bad a caller as Criss Angel is a magician.  I think so.  Yes.  I think so.  Oh, I love Shaq Balloon, though.  I'm a huge fan.  Shaq Balloon is great.  We should...  And then you get a dummy like Flavor Flav.  He'll play the part nice for you.  Yeah, because they're all in on it.  They're all in on it.  But Flav, you could probably say, Flav, look at that bush.  Look at that bush, Flav.  Oh, damn.  Look at that.  But while he's looking at the bush, they're switching out Shaq and the balloon.  Shaq's floating.  Just show him shiny shit.  Yeah, boy, look at Shaq. 
[00:55:30]  Like, Flav really believes the trick, and he was there.  Yeah, yeah.  He wasn't acting.  Yeah, okay.  But there was a marathon on last night, and I just kept going back to it if I was around  the channels.  They were trying to compete with the David Blaine special by putting on a Believe marathon?  Yes, yes.  Yeah, and what killed it?  It was so bad.  It was like the Super Bowl.  Everyone in the crowds that he has around him for every dumb trick he does is in on  the fucking gag.  And it's obvious. 
[00:56:00]  I mean, I could understand maybe doing one of those every so often, but it's every trick  he does.  You should study the crowd and see if it's the same people.  The same people show up.  They probably throw sunglasses on them and change them around a little bit.  He did another trick last night where he had this woman, this short woman, and a tall  guy, and they were standing like in a kind of a field, you know, a park, and they had  blankets, and they signed their own arms. 
[00:56:30]  So she signs her arm, and he signs his own arm, and they covered themselves with the blankets,  and then David Blaine pulls the blankets off, and they were switched.  Criss Angel or David Blaine?  Criss Angel.  Okay, Criss Angel.  Criss Angel pulled the blankets off, and the woman was standing.  Yes, they should have.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  And they switched position, but on the guy's arm now was the woman's signature.  Whoa, that's crazy.  And it was all a camera cut, and it was all inside a crowd that he was using. 
[00:57:00]  We're calling him out on his presentation.  I hope people understand that.  Oh, I know it's not real magic.  Right.  But his illusion isn't an illusion.  His presentation's very lazy.  Yeah, and it's a camera trick.  That's all it is.  Yeah.  Anybody could do it.  You could do a camera trick.  Special effect.  I hate it.  I'm not sitting there wondering if, when I watch Jurassic Park, that they got real dinosaurs.  And why do they always have to cover their shit up for the magic to work? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a good point.  Cover that up.  Just call them out.  Go, all right, if you're a magician, now do it without the fucking big, huge blanket.  Yeah, there's got to be like some suspension of disbelief.  Uh-huh.  And not for one second did anybody believe Shaq Balloon.  No one believed Shaq.  He floated over to your house.  No, Chip, don't believe it.  I fucking seen it.  I think the trick itself is pretty smart.  Doing Shaq Balloon.  Shaq Balloon.  But it just, there had to be a better way to pull it off. 
[00:58:00]  It's obvious you need the audience in on it, though.  Yeah, when you've got to have Shaq leave the frame and then replace him with a balloon.  Right.  Your trick is fun.  How awkward is that when Chris Angel walks in with the Shaq Balloon to start his illusion?  Blowing it up.  Right.  Blowing it up behind the house.  That has to awkwardly come out with it.  He's red-faced.  And then he has to talk to the crowd.  Okay, so now where we're at in the trick is.  All right.  Shaq obviously is now in the house, chilling out.  And now we have Shaq Balloon. 
[00:58:30]  This is going to look great on TV.  Just be amazed by the Shaq Balloon.  Could you do that, people?  Just be amazed.  It's got that jersey thing going on.  No, it's Long Island first.  Long Island.  Oh, is it?  Same thing.  It's a Long Island slash speech impediment thing happening.  No, I'm going to pull out Shaq Balloon and it's going to float over the house.  I want everyone to go suffer and fuck a tash.  Guys, I need you to bear with me for one more second.  Bear with me. 
[00:59:00]  Can we see Shaq Balloon take off again?  Guys, the Shaq Balloon popped.  You want to see Shaq Balloon again?  Just because now that we all are in.  Let's watch him take off.  I just want to see where Shaq Balloon takes off.  I want to see Shaq Balloon take off too.  Oh, this is the commercial for Shaq Balloon.  I mean, it's the world of magic.  But if I could do anything greater than that, that would be something to see.  I've known Shaq for some of us.  He said, I want Chris Angel to make me float.  I challenge Chris. 
[00:59:30]  Makes him float.  So we're going to put that together.  Shaq float, you start with chocolate ice cream.  Is this something that we can really bring to life?  Shaq Balloon.  Why did everyone have to rub their hands together?  It's magic, Hopi.  Yay.  Levitate Shaq.  Just one of the 11 epic illusions.  That's a different crowd.  Yes, there were kids there.  That was take one.  Oh, Christ.  He is the worst.  The kids popped the Shaq Balloon.  I was tugging my willy while everybody clapped.  Levitate the head of my penis.  Yeah, levitate my jizz in your hiney. 
[01:00:00]  Because children love balloons.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why he brought the children in.  They're like, look, kids, a Shaq Balloon.  They're like, oh, and they just use that reaction.  Is there any shots really of the balloon and the odd crowd together?  Is it possible that those were shot separately?  Maybe.  No, possibly.  That's why I want to see Shaq Balloon take off again.  Shaq has been calling me out for years.  Has he?  For years.  Okay, now there's Shaq's on the ground.  Go full screen.  Relax, relax.  All right, so now everyone is touching.  Everyone's around Shaq. 
[01:00:30]  Touching Shaq to give him some take.  Where's the kids?  There are kids.  It's a different crowd.  Start to lift up now.  All right, now that's Shaq Balloon.  Yeah, now that's Shaq Balloon.  Don't release your hand yet.  Yeah, because he kind of...  See, the guy on the left can't help himself.  He knows it's Shaq Balloon.  The guy in the black t-shirt.  Why would you...  He doesn't look amazed at all.  Pause.  We are going to break this down.  Why wouldn't you, as Criss Angel and his production staff, go, all right, that guy is fucking  laughing at Shaq Balloon. 
[01:01:00]  Let's do it again.  Let me see him laugh.  We've got to get rid of Shaq...  That guy.  It's subtle, but it's the guy on the left.  The guy on the left.  The guy on the right is doing a really bad acting job of looking too surprised.  Yeah, he's very surprised.  And then the guy on the left couldn't look less surprised.  Like, of course Shaq Balloon is raising.  Because he realizes, as they're doing it, how ridiculous this is, and he can't help himself.  It's saying he's laughing.  He's laughing.  See, if Shaq was...  Oh my God, he's laughing.  If Shaq was levitating, and obviously you want to make this believable for the audience, 
[01:01:30]  you wouldn't have a guy laughing.  You'd have guys like, what the fuck?  And why is Carrot Top involved in this?  I don't know.  Fat Carrot Top.  I guess they're...  No, that's actual Carrot Top.  That's really Carrot Top.  Oh, they got Carrot Top.  Yeah.  He's just his boy, I guess, because they hang out in Vegas.  I guess they give...  You know, it's quid pro quo.  Why does he have a frumpy butt?  I thought he's a workout guy.  He is.  That's why he's got his Carrot Crew t-shirt on.  Carrot Crew.  Carrot Crew.  Ugh.  And you see Shaq Balloon float?  Well, go back to Laughing Guy, though.  You would have to get rid of Laughing Guy. 
[01:02:00]  And look at this fucking idiot with the chain wallet thing.  Yeah.  Whoa!  Oh, look at it.  He's overdoing it.  Whoa!  And you know Criss Angel had to tell him beforehand, look, raise it all at the same time.  You gotta keep Shaq Balloon level, or people will know that he's a balloon.  No, Shaq Balloon has helium in it.  Yeah, yeah.  So, they don't even have to do anything.  But that's just it.  They all have to just kind of...  If one guy raises too quickly, Shaq Balloon's feet would go up.  Well, let's see if they fucked that up, too. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  You think Chris was looking at this, like, is this the best take?  Is this the best take we have?  Where's the kids?  They weren't really there.  That was a different take.  He made them disappear.  It's more magic.  I bet you, because they tried it with the kids, and they couldn't get the right reaction.  So, like, all right, we gotta get the ballon.  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, I want Shaq Balloon.  Right.  All right, go back to Shaq Balloon.  All right.  Get ready to pause it, though.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  So, then you got a laughing guy on the left.  He's like, this is so stupid. 
[01:03:00]  He's breathing.  No, he's got Criss Angel breathing.  All right, now they cut it.  Why did they cut the flaving character?  Because the balloon wasn't stable.  You could see that it was moving to the left too much.  And now you need, like...  So, they went for the cut.  The strings, or whatever the fuck is controlling Shaq Balloon.  Right.  I bet there's some kind of remote control on it.  You think it's remote control Shaq Balloon?  Like one of those remote control blimps.  Dude, that would rule.  Yeah.  That's a possibility.  There'd be Shaq Balloon propellers. 
[01:03:30]  But you never see his head, so he probably has a propeller on his head.  He's wearing one of those old beanies.  Right.  Because you never really see Shaq's head.  No.  Not completely.  And there's a lot of sun glare and lens flare stuff.  Which is smart.  They shot it into the sun, which is...  Yes.  Everyone knows you don't do that.  You don't do that.  So, he could obviously film Shaq, quote, levitating from the other angle.  Look at the guy on the left is so amazed.  He's making Bowser face.  Look right there in the background. 
[01:04:00]  It gives it away.  You can see there's a little truck on the side that says balloon truck.  I'll bet they didn't let Flava Flav in on it.  They just kept him away from the crowd.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And so he actually gets something from him.  He actually is amazed.  He's not fucking dope.  All right.  Let's watch Shaq Balloon float.  How does he remember to breathe?  It's a big record release party.  Chris Angel's right under Shaq Balloon now.  All right.  Let's go.  But they don't stay on it long enough for you to... 
[01:04:30]  You saw the wave in your legs there, right?  Yes.  And then it's into the sun.  And now Shaq Balloon is blowing away.  Come with me.  Come with me, everybody.  For all.  For all.  Over the house.  All the way up there.  Then again...  Hold on a second.  Oh, no.  See, that's where you can totally tell it's a balloon.  He wobbles because he's too close to the roof.  Now, he's going on the other side of the house. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  So maybe, you know, by the time all the people get there, they're able to do the switcheroo.  To have the Shaq.  Something about...  Can you go back a little bit?  It looks like his ass is almost flat on that one, like he's sitting on something.  Because it's hard to make a Shaq Balloon.  You can't make it perfect.  They didn't inflate the ass enough.  It almost looks like he's laying on something.  Oh, like a green screen?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's why I'm...  I'm going Shaq Balloon all the way.  Oh, I see what you're saying here.  Yeah, it looks really...  But that's Shaq Balloon.  Like he's laying on something.  But you know what they probably did? 
[01:05:30]  That's Shaq Balloon.  That's probably real pants.  And they asfixed it to Shaq Balloon.  What are you doing?  Like they tasted or...  They dressed Shaq Balloon.  Yeah, you have to dress Shaq Balloon.  Like Shaq Balloon doesn't have an ass.  So Shaq has to come there with two sets of clothing.  And the ass is probably like Velcroed to the balloon.  Right.  Oh, okay.  Maybe that's it.  Yeah, because...  Shaq Balloon is just a shell.  And then you've got to dress Shaq Balloon.  Hello, Chris.  It's Shaq. 
[01:06:00]  What's Shaq Balloon wearing?  I've got to wear the same thing as Shaq Balloon.  Now, I've got my Nikes.  What kind of jeans?  Are them Levi's?  What's the sweat of Shaq Balloon wearing today?  We've got someone that's going to explain...  Shaq Balloon?  Yes.  Go ahead, sir.  No, you guys were calling Shaq Balloon.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, my God.  All right, are you going to explain it, Bobo?  Explain Shaq Balloon, Bobo.  I don't know how to explain it.  You guys woke me up.  What?  We're on the radio.  We're on the radio doing our show.  Yeah, I know that, but I've got to...  Shaq Balloon.  How does Shaq Balloon work?  Yeah.  Contribute.  How does Shaq Balloon work?  Right.  We're in the middle of talking about Shaq Balloons.  What do you got?  All I know is it's a giant balloon. 
[01:07:00]  It looks like something that they use in a parade.  Oh, it's like Snoopy Balloon.  They have like an army of people with the strings.  Below Shaq Balloon.  Fucking pulling Shaq along.  Walking him around.  The cat in the hat is right behind him floating.  Yeah, hit some fucking lamppost and knock the lady out.  Oh, shit.  What's Chris Angel's Twitter?  Hack.  I want to ask him if Shaq Balloon's going to be in the Macy's Day Parade this year.  That is a good one.  The Thanksgiving Day Parade. 
[01:07:30]  All right.  I guess you'd have nothing, Bobo.  That's a surprise.  Usually you're pretty good.  Yeah, you guys just woke me up.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, we're on the radio.  We're doing a show.  99 Shaq Balloons.  Shaq Balloons.  What's his Twitter?  Chris Angel.  C-R-I-S-S.  C-R-I-S-S?  Yeah, just kind of a little more magic, a little more crazy.  A-N-G-E-L.  That's it?  I love him.  You love Chris Angel?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Let's go back to Shaq Balloons.  Now we're at the top of the house. 
[01:08:00]  Going all over the top of the house.  And they fucked it up.  They should have got rid of that shot or did it again because you totally see the balloon.  It wavers a little.  And the flat ass.  And the flat ass because, you know, you got Shaq's jeans that you had a Velcro onto  the Shaq Balloon.  Right.  Because the balloon people are going to be like, look, we can make something that looks  like him, but then you're going to have to dress it.  Yeah.  It's wobbling.  It was going back and forth like a teeter-totter.  Right. 
[01:08:30]  Then he goes on the other side of the house.  Look at his feet going like, wah, wah, wah.  And the crowd is so, the sound is just edited in.  It's fake.  Yeah, man.  The people are amazed.  Now Shaq Balloon's coming back down.  Well, he could have had another group of people that just see Shaq Balloon, you know, levitating  above the house.  Look at his face not moving.  The second you have Shaq Balloon in front of all those people, you know they're all in 
[01:09:00]  on it.  Yeah.  Because it's Shaq Balloon.  All you have to do is study the crowd.  They all look like Criss Angel.  Because they're like aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces.  Yeah.  Shaq Balloon.  All right.  Let's...  If Shaq Balloon was...  If Shaq was flying around the Las Vegas skies, he probably would have made a news broadcast.  You'd think.  You'd think.  Well, we're not going to question that.  It's an illusion.  It's just, once again, the presentation stinks.  It would have been a UFN report. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, that was brilliant.  Thank you.  You wouldn't have been unidentified.  No, maybe not.  oh he's back down  yeah Shaq 
[01:10:00]  I had the craziest dream I was a balloon  could you um could you do me a favor  could you do me a favor  could you  could you back it up to the point where Shaq Balloon was uh  hovering  was hovering just about  at the garage door height  because I I just have to see something  very quickly I I want to  confirm something okay  all right something new yeah  oh nice  I still think green screen but no way 
[01:10:30]  Shaq Balloon all the way  his his feet look a little weird against  the blue sky there but but I'm just  saying okay I know it's hard to tell  yeah but doesn't he have tattoos  it is  hard I would you know what I would do I would  freeze that shot put it in Photoshop  and boost some of the fucking levels on it  I think it's I think it's a green screen I'll tell you why it's not a green screen  because his body doesn't move an inch  yeah  and if they were using a green  green screen hopefully smart enough to say 
[01:11:00]  hey Shaq you know what you need to move just  slightly so so it looks like it's a real  body something yeah but it might be as stiff as possible here's why they might have kept him still because it's harder on the green screen there might the stiller he is the easier it is to make a convincing  move yeah something tells me that it's just it's just a green screen that seems like a more controllable thing don't blow up our party it's I don't know I think it's Shaq Balloon it's Shaq Balloon I am the wavering over the roof had has me convinced and the velcro ass and the velcro ass is him laying on all right but  he wants to see something what are you looking at I was looking at his beard uh and he does indeed have the beard there it looked like at one shot uh he didn't have Shaq Balloon didn't have a beard all right let's see but they put a beard on Shaq Balloon yeah you're not gonna make that mistake no no 
[01:11:30]  and it's just very quickly cut see that that's the other thing because you hold on because a balloon is not gonna stay steady enough so they're just finding quick seconds where the balloon is steady because it just when you want to see more of it they always cut away 
[01:12:00]  which goes against producing something and they won't show him hitting the ground no because it's a balloon bounce off it would go boom boom boom boom it's so a balloon when they go back to his shot his shoulders are up and he just puts his shoulders and head back here comes Shaquille O'Neal coming into Lakehurst New Jersey what a lovely day to bring Shaq in Shaq is now they've thrown down the control uh cables people are getting it up the big boomers out there to to get the oh oh no Shaq's exploded 
[01:12:30]  oh no get out of the way get out of the way oh the humanity  we got a guy that's gonna explain the trick oh Shaq Balloon uh I hope so are you gonna explain Shaq Balloon  Shaq Balloon hey guys how you doing yeah um I'm an amateur magician I've actually done a similar trick like this before and actually fucking amateur let me make you feel at home  tada presto you'll roll it need it abracadabra oh go ahead oh sorry guys um you guys are embarrassing me oh it's just black people float and that's that's why the trick works so well oh right 
[01:13:00]  what'd you say dude you're falling crapped out  he's gone oh fucking Shaq Balloon  fucking Shaq Balloon no I want one let's come down to this yeah I want a Shaq we should get a Shaq Balloon for the studio let's get a Jim Norton Balloon I would love that so would everyone they would just touch it who makes these fucking things 
[01:13:30]  I guess Chris Angel Chris Angel and Carrot Top yeah Carrot Top helps him with his props  yeah that's why why Carrot Top's there he's like hey man I know a balloon guy but would you mind I would like to be part of the illusion  do you think that it was Chris Angel Balloon when he levitated above the Luxor yeah was that Chris Angel Balloon is all of his levitation tricks now people balloons wait there's a let's go to that one go to Chris Angel  levitating above the Luxor you know a lot about this Chris Angel guy do you think it's a combination then of maybe a balloon and green screen maybe at one point they couldn't do the balloon so they use green screen no I'm going strictly with balloon 
[01:14:00]  I bet I'll bet I'll bet Carrot Top had a joke about Shaq Balloon right and the joke didn't work and he was like hey Chris Angel you want my Shaq  I got this Shaq Balloon I think you could do something with it maybe you could do something with it that's pretty funny yeah  yeah um oh they got the Shaq Balloon from Ted's Celebrity Balloon Emporium I didn't know that thank you Art and PA 
[01:14:30]  now there is Chris Angel above high above the Luxor but his arms are and look at the light the way the  light's all fucking wild he's on no he's on a wire well he's standing it's hard to tell because you know  they made sure oh yeah he's moving his arms his arms are moving like he's flying but I mean obviously he's on  some kind of cables with a helicopter and you see more people laughing yeah by the way how stupid this is  there's a heli and then they cut him off I'd be scared there's a helicopter right that's filming the 
[01:15:00]  thing that's probably the part how many bugs must be around that light oh yeah like moth central  he's not moving up and down and his feet are saying hey what's that looking out over the strip  is the culmination of a lifetime stream that's come to fruition he's probably just on a plexiglass 
[01:15:30]  platform you can see he's doing something right yeah because why isn't he moving his legs he's only  moving his arms yeah he's just you're floating you don't give a fuck you would move your legs around  and that's where there's that light beam coming from the thing so you can't see that there's only  that light beam oh that's always there no that's why I picked this spot how do you think he got  stood up on that well that's his you know that's his illusion yeah he's probably got a mechanism the 
[01:16:00]  cables the cables probably go up through his pant legs through a harness out his shoulders yeah you  know so he's standing basically on something he's being braced and he probably raises up from the top of  right why would no one see that and go hey they do they do a lot of times they they do and there's  a lot of times you know what else he uses i i heard when it's a real audience and not a plant  they they do things when the crowd is around like all right ladies and gentlemen uh check this out 
[01:16:30]  before chris angel comes out and then they'll like do a fireworks display and they'll get people  looking going like oh oh or they'll have some kind of other thing that's a big attraction well some of  that stuff's smart and they go oh and then they use those clips right to be like holy shit yeah yeah  but sugar but the other thing too if you see any guy just on wires above a building you're pretty  impressed by that alone that's true that's crazy yes right yes so you don't even really yeah yeah 
[01:17:00]  you almost don't even need the illusion part because you're just amazed that someone would be crazy  enough to even just be up there with their wires or fucking helicopter hanging from a helicopter  whatever the fuck right fucking tony montana's down there pointing up i never trusted him yeah  chris angel's okay he's fucking looking like where he looked where fucking omar used to be  this all started with the rob ford uh matt lauer clip and we went uh off-roading so after the break  we'll get back to the rob ford clip of the day with matt lauer okay look at his floating over the house 
[01:17:30]  video classic crane work and everyone was in on it dr steve what do you mean crane work chris angel  is known to use cranes too and people around him miraculously don't see them when they film  a literally a crane that picks it picks people up you know it's got like a wire and they have a  harness no man because well i'm just saying it's still shack would have moved a little bit it's  shack or his body would have been moving a little bit yes even if he's supposedly under some spell 
[01:18:00]  oh he's the muscles would still be floaty yeah exactly what is a funny video oh shit why woman  not happy with chris angel's botched trick oh cool let's yeah and then you get like you got to listen  to all the people's reactions after it too uh-huh what is he trying to do so he's got uh six swords  now this is one he did last night i believe i saw on um i saw on the marathon and and i guess the  the sixth one is supposed to be controlled by an audience member uh-huh now in this clip the 
[01:18:30]  audience member pulls the rope and of course nothing happens of course because it's not  uh-oh it's not controlling the sword actually oh boy  oh no oh no oh no oh no that's embarrassing oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no could you pull the 
[01:19:00]  Can we pull the warrant for me, please?  Can we pull the warrant?  Yeah, exactly.  See, what did I tell you is you have to figure it out.  It's not easy.  It's not an easy act.  My grandkids left because they got a shitty performance.  What did she say?  She said, my grandkids left because they got a shitty performance.  She looks like she's on meth.  Yes.  My grandkids left.  For fucking three hours.  I call it bullshit.  It looks like they're trying to shoot everybody being excited about the conclusion. 
[01:19:30]  I'm a lost vegan and I've been here all my life.  It looks a little contrived.  It looks a little contrived.  I wouldn't pay $95 to see him if this is a crappy pool.  Fuck that.  If we all scream really loud, we get to be in the TV show.  Oh, man.  I'm so impressed.  Take three.  And that would have went right through his chest. 
[01:20:00]  He was on that table.  Right.  And the swords were falling around him individually.  Someone would pull the cord and the sword would fall.  Right.  It was very dramatic.  And then he gets up and that's the last one.  And that's the one that falls and would have killed him.  Did they show the part where he pulled it and then nothing happened?  You know what?  I was getting up and down for like a beer or something.  So maybe I missed that part.  Have you seen that? 
[01:20:30]  Where's that trick in completion?  Uh, on, uh, last on the, the, the, the, but believe it was, uh, this one.  Yes.  That's the one.  That's the trick.  Oh, that's so embarrassing.  Well, that's funny.  It's like, Oh, look, it is.  It's the same trick.  Put your finger on number one.  Got it.  Yeah.  Why would you think people wouldn't film this?  Pull it and drop it on the ground.  Barbara, put your finger on number two. 
[01:21:00]  Haha.  She puts it on a big lump of shit.  Haha.  Barbara.  Yes.  Pull number two now.  It's so fucking fake.  They're not, the ropes aren't actually connected to swords at all.  No.  No.  They don't want to take a chance.  They're not going to listen.  It doesn't.  Barbara's pretty.  Haha.  He makes out.  Barbara, put your finger on number four.  As we do this, the odds get more in the favor of me getting stabbed. 
[01:21:30]  No, they don't.  More in the favor.  More in the favor.  More in the favor.  Barbara, there are two swords above me.  There's five and six.  I want you to take your finger and I want you just to touch the top of the pin of five.  Got it.  Now touch six.  Got it.  Listen to your inner voice.  I trust you, Barbara. 
[01:22:00]  Do you believe in fate?  Yes, I do.  You can change your mind.  What are you feeling?  Five or six, Barbara?  I feel six.  Okay.  Six?  Yes.  Do you really feel that, Barbara?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  Fucking suspense.  I'm going to have to go with you, Barbara.  Take your hand off five.  Take it.  Oh.  Holy .  She inadvertently pulled it. 
[01:22:30]  What the fuck kind of horse shit.  Now he gets off the table.  Right.  And this is the last one.  This is where it fucked up.  That sucks.  They didn't show the lady.  No.  They didn't show the guy.  They didn't show anything.  Who said, I think if you clap, you'll be able to get on the TV show.  Right.  If you make a lot of noise, you could get on the TV show.  I'm about the part where it didn't work.  They should leave that in the show.  Yeah.  Where she pulls and then nothing happens. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, my God.  It's all just fucking bad.  And now, again, I understand these are illusions.  It's not real magic.  I'm not that stupid.  But it's supposed to be like something people.  That was the amazing thing about watching a magician is you could not figure out what was being done.  And it was clever and stuff.  He's using bad camera tricks and just.  And balloons.  And balloons.  And shack balloon.  If you watch it on TV, you're supposed to believe that the audience watching it. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Is also being tricked.  It's supposed to be like, if I was there live, it would be just as amazing.  That's supposed to lend it credibility is that there's a live audience watching.  Right.  They're there as your proxy to watch this.  And meanwhile, they're all in on it.  And you could tell by the bad act.  They're badly.  They're badly in it.  Yes.  Are we convinced now that Criss Angel is possibly the worst magician?  No.  That was ever fucking magicianing?  No.  It's strange.  Really?  There's a lot of clever stuff and newer stuff.  But it's easy to come up with clever stuff if look. 
[01:24:00]  But the balloon trick would be really fucking cool, but he just doesn't pull it off.  Right.  Oh, God.  I.  They're all obviously illusions in the end, like Penn and Teller.  You're not going to.  You're not going to sit there 30 seconds into a trick and go, oh, that they're using a balloon.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yes.  You're in your fucking head for days.  How did they do that?  How the fuck did he?  And he explains how.  No.  He.  He takes years on tricks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He does it all of a sudden.  Like, I bet you Criss Angel went, oh, fuck.  Shaq balloon. 
[01:24:30]  Balloons.  And then goes, let's tape it next weekend.  Like, if that was Penn and Teller, they would probably work the Shaq balloon for a year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At least.  Well, that's the art is coming up with an idea and then creating this thing where you're convincing  people that it could be real.  Right.  And that takes a really long time.  You have to stand in the pentagram.  Ugh.  Damn.  Oh, God.  Chip believes it all.  More awkward moments.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails. 
[01:25:00]  That was a shitty joke that barbed.  And fouled mouth rants.  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Continues.  Next.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2020.  And we are continuing on with the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  We're on day nine.  We're up to the part where we're going to Canada. 
[01:25:30]  It's another first for the Opie and Anthony show in 2013.  We travel abroad for the first time for our first international broadcast.  We head up to Montreal, Canada for the Just for Laughs festival.  One of the biggest comedy festivals in the world.  Two days of live broadcasts with dozens of comedians coming in and out of the show.  The next few segments is a condensed version of those two days.  And hopefully we'll be back for Just for Laughs 2014.  ONA's worst of 2013.  Can I tell that story that you were telling me about getting your baby pictures? 
[01:26:00]  When we were on the phone the other day, where you got the baby pictures done?  I guess you can now, Joe.  Do you think these assholes are going to let it go?  They have nothing to talk about.  They just brought up my podcast for the first time ever.  When's your podcast?  Tell us.  Talk to us.  Don't tell if it's going to embarrass Bobby.  No, no.  If you don't want me to tell it, I won't tell it.  Shut up.  Tell it.  I'm kidding.  Tell it.  Oh my God.  You think I meant that?  I can't tell. 
[01:26:30]  Dude.  Tell the story, Joe.  I called the other day.  I go, what are you doing?  He goes, dude, I'm going upstate.  And I go, we're going to go do this, this.  And I go, okay, cool.  And he goes, then we're going to Bailey J's house to take pictures with the baby.  Oh no.  Wow.  And I go, can you give this kid a fighting fucking chance to not be the piece of shit  that we are?  And he goes, she's not going to be in the pictures, asshole.  Her husband's going to take him.  Even so.  Well, he's a good photographer and he's cheap. 
[01:27:00]  Holy.  I'll explain to my kid later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who was there?  Yeah.  Who was holding the flag?  Yeah.  He'll give me that one picture of you with your head under the dress like you're taking  a picture in 1910.  Riley likes that one too.  Yeah.  It's an open house.  My kid, my kid pissed on Matt's foot in the photo.  Yeah.  He's used to that.  Yeah.  Fucking Christ. 
[01:27:30]  I'm just throwing out stinkers.  No, that wasn't bad.  But that was a fucking, that was a Jake LaMotta comeback.  You're used to that.  No, no.  I meant because of Bobby.  I meant because his wife's got a dick.  I got it.  I got it.  Oh, okay.  We all got it.  All right.  This wasn't funny.  That's a good point.  No, you're used to that was actually what LaMotta said in Raging Bull.  Oh, he did?  He blamed us for being stupid.  Yeah.  Not his joke stinking.  I didn't.  I blamed myself.  I said, I've been throwing out stinkers all day.  That's what I said.  Oh, Joe. 
[01:28:00]  Wow, Joe.  Have a little confidence in yourself.  Jay looks, I mean, honest to God though, unbelievable.  Oh, sure.  Oh, she looks.  I mean, we were, me and my wife, Dawn came up too.  We were hanging out with, they have a beautiful home in a cul-de-sac next to a pagan witch  and some other hippie.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you can't just move.  A cul-de-sac.  How ironic.  You can't just move into a.  You can't just move into a regular family.  Yeah, yeah.  You gotta go.  A pagan witch.  So, uh.  Yeah, Bailey posted a few pictures recently. 
[01:28:30]  Unbelievable.  And it was like, whoa, okay.  Oh, my God.  That gets, it's so confusing.  Yeah.  I'm not, I'm no longer confused about it.  Oh, you're not.  Rock her dick and lick her asshole.  Joe!  Joe!  Joe!  What?  What do you mean what?  Travis, I'm sorry.  It's fine, Joe.  I'm sorry, I apologize.  Travis, what are you apologizing for?  He did the same thing.  Oh, it's fine.  Between, not so much Travis, but with Lisa in the house.  House, what the fuck was I just doing?  I don't know, but you see how easy. 
[01:29:00]  It sounded Canadian.  Lisa in the house.  It went from home to house and it connected.  It sounded Canadian.  Yeah, usually that's Jimmy is simulating, you know.  Simulating.  No one knows what that word means, Bob.  What are you going to do?  You're simulating.  No.  Say it in an English accent.  I woke up.  Going to the gym?  Yeah, you know.  Eating batter.  I lost a little weight.  I got injured sleeping.  I hurt my hand in the goddamn pillow.  Sometimes you hurt yourself.  I was biting the pillow.  Yeah, I've got fingerprints in my hips like they're dull. 
[01:29:30]  I love that me scratching my cornea turned into me getting banged in the ass by some dude in Montreal.  You wouldn't fess up to exactly how it happened, so we must speculate that you were getting dicked in the ass.  So, Joe, back to what you just said and how important it really is.  You would suck Bailey J's dick.  Well, remember about a year ago, I was on the fence about whether I'd suck her dick or not.  I am far past.  I am off of that fence.  Wow.  That fence post is firmly planted in my ass. 
[01:30:00]  He bent over the fence post.  You didn't need to be on the fence.  I unlocked the gate and walked through it for you.  Joe, what changed?  I just think she's so fucking hot that the idea of putting her dick in my mouth turns me on.  Wow.  Joe, you're gay.  You're just gay.  Well, hold on now, Bob.  Tom is disgusting.  And that's amazing.  Canada really changes people.  It all seems okay up here. 
[01:30:30]  Everybody's so nice.  Very liberal.  Very liberal thinking people.  That's for laughs.  Tom watched Liberace get his balls tickled in the bathtub for a month and he's creeped  out by Joe.  That was wordy.  I didn't think he was going to make it.  He was flat.  He pulled it out.  I think he did.  Joe, you don't think that's gay, Joe?  No, not at all.  Because I don't want to blow any of the fine looking gentlemen in this room.  Insult the audience, Joe.  No, no, no.  I'm not insulting them.  I'm kidding.  I can't tell anymore. 
[01:31:00]  I don't know why.  Maybe you were going to throw your coffee on me last week because I thought you were being  serious and you're like, I'll throw my fucking coffee.  Yeah, throw it on your back so you're used to it.  Yeah.  Like fucking cum.  Jesus.  Hold the coffee just the cream.  So, wow.  So you're thinking of it this way.  It's just a woman with a penis.  Yes.  That's right.  It's just an extension of her.  Yes.  It's a long, hard vagina.  Yes. 
[01:31:30]  You know what Joe's going to really realize he fucked up is when just that load hits his  mouth and he's going to go like this.  I fucked up.  I fucked up.  I fucked up.  I need a barrel.  I need a barrel.  Yes.  It's going to be like when you get a bad bite of a tuna fish sandwich and you just go,  oh, oh, oh, oh.  I fucked up.  He's going to run home in the woods.  It doesn't taste like a girl. 
[01:32:00]  It doesn't taste like a girl.  What was I thinking?  I'll tell you when you realize you fucked up.  It's when the aftertaste hits you.  Oh, God.  Of the sperm or the penis?  Oh.  The sperm.  Oh, I didn't know.  I was just wondering if there's an aftertaste to a penis, too.  No.  I know.  Jimmy.  I was.  I know.  Oh, boy.  I wonder what that's like.  What is the aftertaste?  Bleach.  Seriously? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  My ex-girlfriend.  I used to come in her mouth and she'd come blow it in my face and go.  Did my breast smell?  I come.  Hey, did your ex-girlfriend have a cock?  Stop.  Stop acting like you had to come inside somebody else's mouth and they spit it back in your mouth.  No, no.  It came directly from the fountain.  No, no, no.  Later on, Jim cut out the middle man.  I'm not denying that, but I'm just saying that where I get the aftertaste thought from  is from a girl blowing the breath in my face.  Travis's kid was just marched out of the roof.  Yes, yes, yes. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, but.  Smirly.  We found her line.  This is the funny part.  That was it.  The grandfather stayed.  He's still all in.  I like where this is going.  I like where this is going.  Oh, God.  You enjoyed the show, sir?  Not much.  Grandpa, you all right?  I am.  We had to get the kid out of here, though?  No, no.  She had to go to the can.  To the con.  That's it.  She actually turned to Luis and said, Mommy, I got to take a shit.  Just what she's learned over the years.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  Anthony, you've never tasted your own jizz?  No, you know what?  Yeah, I guess I've.  Wow, this is a fucking solid answer.  Hamna, hamna, hamna, hamna.  Hamna, hamna, hamna, hamna.  No, well, yeah.  I have, actually.  No, because I was going to say no, because you just think of, like, you come and then  fucking shove it in your mouth.  Not like that, but I have.  No, you come in your mouth.  I have come in a girl.  Because your dick is so big.  You come on a spoon.  I have come in a girl.  Yes, I use a spoon.  I'm civilized.  I have come in a girl.  Jesus. 
[01:34:00]  And then, like, kind of gone down on her.  Yeah, who hasn't?  Later on in the evening.  Really?  You know.  Not like shoving my tongue in there to, like a fucking, when you get the edges  of an ice cream sandwich.  You know.  I was, you know, just the outside, but it still tastes a little.  As soon as you said it.  That's the best answer.  I'm going to ask, well, we know.  Obi.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  Why are you getting nervous?  What?  Obi's all of a sudden testifying in front of Congress.  He turns to his life, should I answer this?  Yes.  Covers the mic a little.  Yeah?  Yeah, sure.  Give it a little taste.  Sure.  Yeah.  A little taste.  Why not?  Anything to spice up that oatmeal in the morning.  Exactly.  Bobby has to turn the whole show gay when it comes on.  Bobby.  It's not gay.  I'm just asking if you ate the, you know. 
[01:35:00]  I'm just asking if you ate cum after we talked to Joe about sucking a man's dick.  Yeah.  Nothing gay there.  She is not a man.  Absolutely.  Good point, Joseph.  All right.  White knight over here defending her.  That's right.  That's right.  She's my baby.  I know.  You fucking talk about her with respect.  I know.  Here's how you know Joe's gay.  Joe, if she didn't have the penis, would you still like her?  Nope.  That's not gay, Bobby.  Joe accepts her as she is.  That is something.  If she was just a girl, exactly the same as she is now, except she was really hot. 
[01:35:30]  Of course I would still like her.  She was retardedly hot.  I will admit though.  But would you be obsessing about her like this?  That's a good question.  No.  There is something unique about her.  Yeah.  It's called the cock balls.  Very unique to a girl.  Very unique.  There's, there's, yeah.  Well, that's what I, I'm infatuated with her because I, Tranny, it's not my thing.  It's never really been my thing.  You're really selling that angle.  It's just not, you know, it's, I can't, I can't explain it. 
[01:36:00]  There, there is something more intriguing about her.  The fact that she is a transsexual, but of course, if she was just a regular girl, I'd,  of course I'd want to.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Or just a girl.  Right.  What do you mean?  No, seriously.  I didn't understand.  What do you mean?  It was bad.  Well, I'm going to be a real, I'm going to be a real man and blow her husband, Matt.  I don't need those tits.  Fuck it.  Where's the guy?  The obsession is because she has a dick.  Joe.  It's a very intriguing thing to me.  Which is really.  Joe says intriguing.  One more time. 
[01:36:30]  I'm going to hit him with this.  Joe, you know, I had a friend who accidentally hooked up with a transvestite at Patty McGee's  on Long Island, like five summers ago.  A friend?  Yeah.  A friend.  A friend.  A friend.  A friend.  A friend.  A friend.  A friend.  A friend.  A friend.  A friend.  A friend.  A friend.  A friend.  A friend.  And then he fucking fell in love with this transvestite.  Wow.  And he wasn't gay.  Whoa.  That's God.  That's God.  And he's dead now. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, Jimmy!  That's my God!  Yeah.  That guy leaned up against the lights.  Yeah, it's awkward.  And what happened?  And he started hooking up with this transvestite.  He hooked up with this transvestite.  Hold on, Chris, Chris.  Were there breasts or no?  What?  Yeah, yeah.  No, the guy, he thought it was a girl.  We all thought it was a...  His breasts are transsexual.  Transsexual, I apologize.  Big difference, trust me.  Transsexual, yeah.  In price, I mean.  And it was pretty...  Yeah, sorry.  And he felt...  He was like in love with her.  It was just like his girlfriend.  And then he broke up with her. 
[01:37:30]  And then he's...  Now he's like...  Has like a wife.  Wow.  Like a regular woman wife.  Does she know?  What?  Does she know?  Yeah, it's like out in the open.  She knows that he did that.  Yeah, everybody knows.  He just...  It was just accepted like he's...  I guess, you know what I mean?  He all had a dick.  It wasn't like chopped off, made a vagina.  It was a penis.  Oh.  See that?  Yeah.  Well, I think it went through the change.  Oh, okay.  So it was a...  Yeah.  Post stop.  Post stop.  So he had a little change purse? 
[01:38:00]  We always wanted him...  He wouldn't...  Because he was like in love with her.  So he wouldn't send us pictures.  No, but the trans...  Did he have a little like a little pocket?  I don't know.  No, he stole the cock, he's saying.  Yeah.  He had the cock.  He went to Thailand.  Yeah.  No, he said he didn't have the cock.  Oh.  The cock was made into the...  He got so confused.  Let me explain something.  Yeah.  This is what your friend told you.  She was pre-op.  She was not post-op.  Because if he was post-op, he would have showed you, hey, look at pussy.  Yeah.  There was still a cop there.  Oh, I love her too much to show you that.  Yes. 
[01:38:30]  Beautiful pussy.  I would never dishonor her.  Yeah.  You keep your quarters for the laundromat and they're fucking snatched.  Oh, and Bobby, you know what too?  This guy, true.  I'm not making...  He scratched his cornea, got infected.  He does have a fake eye.  So you should make sure that you get antibiotics.  Oh, fuck.  How do you go to that?  Absolutely.  I love you, man.  I was kidding about your head.  I love you.  No, I'm just...  You know me.  I care about your...  But I also know you're nuts.  You take one thing and you just worry about it.  Yeah. 
[01:39:00]  I want you to be careful or all you're going to be doing is fucking playing Peter Pan  and doing Wheat Thins commercials.  Yeah.  Sandy Duncan, you young cocksuckers.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  People should remember old commercials from 30 years ago.  Who the fuck's going to get a Sandy Duncan reference?  Apparently no one.  Yeah.  I don't see that as being our fault.  It was a Higgins from Magnum P.I. joke.  You dickheads.  I'm like, what?  Cagney and Lacey, you bags of shit.  Have you seen how good the post-op vaginas look? 
[01:39:30]  Holy shit, Joe.  Well, I like them.  You are all in.  No one asked you.  Just because I follow a couple transsexuals on Twitter and I look at their pictures constantly.  Pictures.  Yeah.  I've seen a couple of pictures of those things.  They, you know, I guess as more time goes on, they get better at doing that.  I can't believe it's not butter.  They take the penis.  They take the penis.  They take the penis.  They, they pretty much just hollow it out and then they flip it inside out.  Yeah. 
[01:40:00]  Like a dishwasher glove.  Right.  Like a dishwasher glove.  But what's the real test is like, do they smell like balls still?  Or is it?  Oh God.  It would have to, right?  It would have to.  It's not going to smell like a woman.  A post-op and then, and, uh, I suspect it was a post-op cause it was like that.  The, uh, the, the, the features that looked like duck lip.  Like I just had a really weird instinct and I went to see a woman and as we're fucky,  I could feel that it wasn't normal.  It felt like different or something foreign about it.  Cause it was, I don't think it was as wet as it should admit.  And I just, I never asked, but I left and I went, that was a fucking post-op transsexual. 
[01:40:30]  Cause I could just sense my instincts told me there was something.  I heard, I heard that the, it actually can get wet though.  Oh, maybe in just the, the, the, the fuck is that?  I swear.  I found a picture of a post-op.  Bobby, you want to see this one?  I got some great ones.  Bobby.  Well, yeah.  Let me see.  You know what?  First of all, Obie's trying to make me puke, but it's too far away.  It looks like a salad.  It looks like a salad.  That should make you puke. 
[01:41:00]  I love Canadian crowds.  They're actually nice.  Yeah, they are.  Savage mean fans back in the States.  It's true.  They actually went aww.  I love them all.  I had a buddy that did that.  They got a, they got a, they didn't even realize it was transsexual at first.  And they, this is a vagina.  It was just like unusable.  Unusable.  Your asshole does a lot of the work.  Yeah.  You get that thick pussy.  It's a two, it's a two hole operation.  It's not it.  Your asshole does all the heavy lifting.  You said her asshole looked like the hole in the wall they pulled Carol Ann out of  and pulled the grave.  Well, that's what's so funny too about like Arab chicks. 
[01:41:30]  Like I'm half Arab.  They, they won't fuck in a vagina because it, that means you, they lost their virginity,  but they'll let you take them in the asshole.  Oh, that's good.  So that's like really romantic on your wedding night.  It's like, honey, I can't get my dick into your airtight vagina.  Can I just take a shot at your gaping asshole?  That's Joe DeRosa, by the way, for all the Arabs listening up here.  Joe DeRosa.  Joe DeRosa.  I'm half Arab.  Yeah.  That's not good enough.  It's twice as bad.  I think that's worse. 
[01:42:00]  I think that's actually worse.  Yeah.  You should know better.  Allah.  Allah.  Allah.  Lock your fucking head off.  Jesus.  You don't think they stopped listening at the dick sucking part earlier?  Yeah.  You think they're still tuned in?  Yeah.  That's where they tuned in.  Still hanging in there.  You have post-ops on your phone?  I have.  There's a transsexual girl I follow called Kelly Pierce.  Kelly, why?  She's good-looking.  She's not Bailey, but she looks good.  Where's she from? 
[01:42:30]  I don't know.  She's a porn star.  I mean, she's a...  Let me see.  Her website is...  Oh, boy.  He's got all the info.  This is weird, man.  I love how it started out like it was kind of an interesting one-off quirky thing.  Bailey J is like, no, I got pictures.  And now he's screaming.  She doesn't post as much content as she's supposed to.  Right.  On her Twitter feed, though, she had pictures of post-op vaginas.  And I could...  I thought they were just pictures of vaginas. 
[01:43:00]  They were so perfect and gorgeous.  Oh, wow.  And then under him, it was like, great post-op work done here.  And I was like, I couldn't believe...  What's her website?  That it wasn't the real thing.  Um...  It's like a blog spot thing.  It says blogtalkradio.com slash midnight...  Forget it.  It's like...  It's so long.  It doesn't even fit.  But her pictures...  I can't find her pictures.  Then they make labia out of the bulls.  Yeah, out of the fucking bulls.  They cut him out of there.  Out of your bull bag.  Out of your yam bag.  They fucking fashion some kind of a twat. 
[01:43:30]  Dr. Dice, pair your scalpel, please.  I need to make a gash out of this cock.  Oh!  Then Dr. Steve jumps in.  There's extra parts, though, right?  Like, what do you do with the leftover...  Can we please just have Dr. Dice keep explaining?  Please.  Please.  I'm asking Dr. Dice.  Dr. Dice.  You gotta take the piece of the head. 
[01:44:00]  You know, the sensitive part that makes you go...  And then they fashion a clitoralist, or whatever they call it.  So, you know, because the chick still gotta get off.  Because even though she had a cock, now she's a hooah.  The funniest Vine videos I've ever done were at your house.  Oh, God.  And it's just me, and I go, here's Dice.  Here's Dice pouring a shot of Jagermeister.  And then it cuts to Anthony, poor Jagermeister.  And he's going, get in there!  Gays!  Gays! 
[01:44:30]  Gays!  And then the second one is me going, here's Dice explaining the religious poem Footprints.  And it cuts to Anthony and he goes, the hardest part of my life!  You abandoned me, you cocksucker!  Gays!  Eh, Jesus!  Only one set of footprints, you prick!  Gays!  Gays!  And then he said, I carried you!  Gays!  Gays!  Gays!  Gays!  Gays! 
[01:45:00]  Gays!  Gays!  All right, back to trannies.  Ah, right.  Actually, breaking news, the cock pictures have come out,  the new Anthony Weiner cock pictures.  Oh, goody.  Let's see.  Breaking news.  You mean Carlos Danger.  Carlos Danger.  Yes.  If you go to thedirty.com,  they're saying this is the first time they've ever posted dirty pictures.  Is that a local story, or did you hear about that up here in Canada?  Anthony Weiner.  You guys know?  Yeah, Carlos Danger, dick pics. 
[01:45:30]  Was it after he got busted?  Yes.  This is two days ago.  What an idiot.  It was after he...  And now the cock pictures came out today.  It's just breaking news.  After he resigned, he kept doing it.  He kept doing it.  For a year.  For a year.  And just the most fucking perverted shit.  It's great.  You got it?  That's his...  He's got a big, fat one.  Does he?  Not really, no.  I was not that...  Yeah, I knew he was doing trick fucking angles with that other picture.  Oh, that one.  Pretty nice, dude.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  That's fucking...  That's a new one. 
[01:46:00]  That's...  He's got a lot of nerve calling that Carlos Danger.  That's Facebook magic.  That should be Frank Caution.  Holy fuck.  That's like where the girl fucking holds the camera way up here.  Yeah.  How does he get that slimming look?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of angles to make your cock look fucking phenomenal.  And then you got to plump it up to the point where it doesn't look like you got a hard  on.  Yeah.  But, you know, the second it starts twitching, put the camera down. 
[01:46:30]  And what did he do?  You got to wait.  Give it 10 minutes.  So he...  Was he on, like, public sites with it?  Or was he dealing with, like, friends of his who were just texting?  He went by the name Carlos Danger, as we all know, and went on these fucking sites.  What an idiot.  What an idiot.  So he got caught, and he's like, all I got to do to get away with this time is change  my name to Carlos Danger.  Right?  Right.  He got away.  And you know what?  People were willing to forgive him.  He was running for mayor.  He was doing well.  He was doing well.  People put it...  Because he got up there.  He said, look, I did this. 
[01:47:00]  I'm sorry.  I apologize to my wife.  All this happy horse shit.  And then these come out, and he goes, as I told you, and he said, I told you when this  first happened, there were other photos and texts out there.  And they're like, yeah, but when did this come out?  Like last week.  And I fucking did it.  Oh, that's what...  I thought this was just stuff you didn't get caught for.  No.  You didn't need a whole deal.  After he got caught, he kept doing it.  That guy's awesome.  Kept doing it.  And then his wife is just standing there like...  Tee hee.  I stand behind him.  We're working things out.  God.  You fucking owe me. 
[01:47:30]  He's toast.  He must have an actual addiction.  Like, I thought that was bullshit, but...  Yeah.  We were reading his text.  We were reading the text he was sending this 22-year-old girl or something.  And as you're reading it, you're going, no one stops doing it.  Like, the way he would write shit, it's not just like, well, I'd like to get a little frisky with you.  It's like, I want to fucking come in your mouth and hold your hair and pull it.  You don't go from that to like, all right, I'm done.  You don't go from that to like, Mr. Dancer. 
[01:48:00]  Dancer.  You know, you don't stop doing that.  It's, you know.  It's hardcore.  It's not like a guy that occasionally smokes a dube as opposed to a guy that's booting up fucking heroin on a daily basis.  Yes, I said a dube.  A dube.  A doobie.  Well, you know what it is, too?  It's these politicians have such a fucking easy ride.  It's such a beautiful, easy ride.  It's like being a comic or something like that, you know?  And God forbid he walks away.  If he would just walk away from politics, it's like, dude, take your cock out in the middle of the street. 
[01:48:30]  Nobody will give a shit.  You know what I mean?  But he won't walk away from it.  No one cares about what he's doing.  Like, it's a guy texting some fucking 22-year-old girl pictures of his dick and sexting.  More power to you.  It's great.  But then the second you become a politician, that shit's kind of off the table.  Right.  You really kind of got to, you know.  Yeah, when you're making laws about other stuff.  Yeah.  It shows poor judgment.  A lot of times you can actually do stuff like that while you're on a live radio show.  I mean.  Exactly. 
[01:49:00]  You'd be amazed at sometimes you can get a picture texted to you 30 seconds ago.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  Oh, geez.  That's a nice open asshole.  Hello.  That is a gaping asshole.  I told you not to show anybody.  You're an asshole, Jimmy.  More awkward moments.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails.  That was a shitty joke that barbed.  And fouled mouth rants.  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Coming up, O.P. and Anthony's Worst of 2013 continues next. 
[01:49:30]  O.P. and Anthony's Worst of 2013 continues right now.  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  Let's go right to it.  Get in here right now.  We won't break.  Everyone.  She's leaving soon.  Come on, everyone.  Get in.  Hurry.  No.  Over there.  Over there.  Over there.  Over there.  Over there.  Over there.  Over there.  This is Lexi.  Do you know Lexi Love?  Yeah.  I said hi to her.  Oh.  I said hi.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Would you?  Yeah, I would.  Yeah.  What?  You would what?  Yeah.  What would you do? 
[01:50:00]  Lose it with her.  What do you mean lose it?  What?  Lose the virgin.  The virgin tag.  You're a virgin?  Lose the virgin tag.  Lose the virgin tag.  The virgin tag.  I don't know what else to call it, but I've called it many things.  What do you?  Ha ha ha.  Lexi Love's like, oh boy, he's got that predator look in his eyes.  No, not just that nice, that I find her attractive kind of look on my face.  Would you hold them and cup them? 
[01:50:30]  Of course.  Of course.  Well, not now.  He's reaching over.  Jesus.  You're an animal.  Big to suck.  I brought you some cool parting gifts for letting me give you a bath today.  Oh, Bobo.  Is that what's happening?  That's what's happening today.  We have a big container over there.  It's the biggest Rubbermaid storage container.  Right.  That's true.  And later on, we'll be chopping him in half.  Yeah.  Handing you a plugged in toaster.  So I guess.  Toaster bath. 
[01:51:00]  That'd be great.  Thank you.  Jimmy's leaving really soon, so I think we should get right to it.  Yeah.  I won't even be.  Hi, Lexi.  I won't even be here for that because I have to leave in five minutes.  Oh, man.  Don't rush the bit for me because you guys want to let it unfold.  Do we?  Do we really?  Yeah.  Let it breathe.  Let it open as quickly as possible.  Let it breathe.  Bobo, get your clothes off.  Lexi Love is going to give you a sponge bath.  Bobo, for the record, also.  Yeah.  This is news to him.  The bath.  Oh, he didn't know this was happening.  Bobo, are you happy about this?  Yeah, well, it's an honor.  Take your clothes off.  You're going to get clothes on.  It's an honor. 
[01:51:30]  It's an honor.  It's an honor.  It's a delicious cock out.  I think you're breaking my V card.  You're definitely breaking my V card.  Yeah, that's your V card for giving somebody a little bath.  And he just took a dump.  Take your clothes off.  What are you doing?  Your shoes, too.  There he goes.  He's trying to take his pants off before his shoes are off.  His ass probably has wiped shit in it.  Oh, God.  Well, at least it'll be taken care of in the bath.  Yeah, you've got to get in there and soap it with your fingers good.  No, I hope.  We've got to let this bit breathe.  It's cold water.  It's snow. 
[01:52:00]  Come on.  It's probably freezing cold.  All right.  Bobo, are you excited over there?  Let's mic the Bobo.  Come on.  Take it off.  What are you doing?  Oh, look at the front of his boxers.  Bobo, he's got a rod.  Come on.  Get your scuff off.  What are you going to do?  Get the top with socks on?  He's already got a rod.  Lexi, he's got a rod.  Oh, God.  Get your pants off.  We've got to get in the top with socks.  Lexi, you did that.  You did that.  Uh-oh.  I'm known for doing this.  Tub time.  Stay tuned for this because it's going to be a real disaster.  Tub time. 
[01:52:30]  He's had a couple of surgeries on his penis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  At least you've been upkeeping with manscaping.  He's had surgeries.  Most of it removed.  He manscapes with Rogaine.  Jesus.  Now, fortunately, I just couldn't make the cut myself.  What?  Bobo, don't just stand there.  Get in the goddamn water.  I don't want to stare at you.  Yeah.  He's completely wrecked.  It's kind of odd. 
[01:53:00]  Why is it odd?  Should we add bubbles?  Yeah, we should.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, yeah.  You need bubbles.  Bubble bath.  Yeah, you need bubbles.  And then Bubba's going to have to splash around a little to make...  Don't get the mic wet, Sal.  To make the bubbles come up.  We got a mic on, Bubba.  All right.  Some bubbles.  Bubba, splash around the bubbles.  Get the bubbles going.  Splash!  Whatever.  I have it.  Like ages.  What?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, this is great.  Andrea Yates gave a sexier bath than this.  What is that?  Oh, yeah.  It's a big...  What is that?  It's a giant dildo on the end of a bat.  It's a dildo bat.  Yeah, that's crazy.  I thought I'd seen it all.  I have not seen one of those.  No, that's amazing.  Exactly.  Where is the big dildo bat?  Where did we get the dildo bat from?  In Saints Row.  Huh?  In Saints Row.  Oh.  All right.  They need applause.  Saints Row.  Thanks, man.  Come on, frolic, would you? 
[01:54:00]  Bobo now has some bubble bath poured on his shoulder.  Sam decided to pour some on his shoulder for some reason.  Well, he's making bubbles now, too.  Yeah.  I should have brought a rubber ducky.  Yeah, a rubber ducky.  Don't worry.  Oh, there it is.  There's a little rubber ducky in the little...  That's right.  A rubber dummy.  Oh, no.  Now, what's going to happen?  Are you going to bathe him?  I guess so.  Is there a big sponge?  Oh, we got a loofah.  Oh, a big loofah.  There it is.  There's a loofah. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  You shouldn't have your top on when you bathe him, though, should you?  Well, no.  No, of course not.  You need to get your clothes wet, Lexi.  First of all, you don't want to get your clothes wet, Lexi.  We don't have replacement clothes for you, so I would take off as much clothing as you  can possibly take off.  Look at the look on Bobo's face.  Yeah.  That is Dave Herman at a nursery school.  Right there.  Creepier.  Well, it's an honor to be able to say this.  All right.  With the honor.  Exactly.  I'm accepting an award.  Yeah.  It's a congressional medal of dummy.  Most shoot pop for three years in a row. 
[01:55:00]  It's an honor to be humiliated.  Yes.  I like this.  Oh, Bobo, what do you think of Lexi's body?  Yeah, she looks great.  Yeah, huh?  Nice dumper.  Wow, she's in a fishnet stocking.  Sal, get out of my photo op.  Come on, Sal.  Jeez, Sal.  Stop giving me a rod.  Move out of the way.  We've got to get a photo.  Lexi love a photo op.  Just here we go.  Bobo photo op.  Wow, Bobo.  Oh, my God.  I need to go.  This is like fucking, what's his name, from one floor over this cuckoo's nest.  Oh, God, yeah.  Where he's going to kill himself. 
[01:55:30]  What scene was that?  Oh, Billy does.  Oh, Billy does.  Billy, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It was great.  Yeah.  Have you been bathed by a woman before?  No, never have.  Just my mother.  Yeah.  We also have some fun soaps, some soap foams.  Oh, well, we need that.  Get in there.  You can write on him.  We can write on him on his head.  Lexi, we'd hate that bra to get wet.  Is there any way that could come off?  Yeah, you really should have your heavy, beautiful bosoms.  Pouting, your pouting bosoms.  Yes, your teardrop, suckable bosoms. 
[01:56:00]  Bobo, what do you think?  Look at these.  What?  Here they come.  They're almost unleashed.  Oh, Bobo.  Oh, what do you think, Bobo?  Yeah.  Look at those, huh?  Nice.  Wow.  You should reach out and just make sure they're real, Bobo.  They look kind of sexy on you, that tie between them.  That's great.  It reminds me of a noose.  Yeah, so they look kind of sexy, that tie between them.  Oh, well, now Sam's applying some of this spray kind of colored foam stuff. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, what the hell is that?  I don't know.  Wow, he's really bubbly.  Looks like a pelican came on him.  Oh, wow.  That's really soapy.  Get some on his head.  He's got to wash his head.  Yeah.  There we go.  Bobo.  Oh, beautiful Bobo.  Is this great, Bobo?  Do you want to take your glasses off, Bobo?  Then I can't see your wonderful titties and the tie between them.  Bobo, how come you didn't check your breasts to make sure they're real?  What are you, a peter pumper?  No, I can see.  I can see. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Why would you fucking...  I don't need to have my penis sucked.  Oh, look, his hair's being all clean now.  He's gazing up at her like a baby bird waiting for some regurgitated worms.  Yeah, that's great.  Look at him.  Look at the depths there.  Yeah, from this angle, it looks like the fucking...  The last five seconds of this is a Pruder film.  She's doing a great job, though.  Look, she's getting his ears and his face and his head.  Do you work in a mental institution, Lexi?  Yeah, there's lots of crazy people who are acting. 
[01:57:30]  It's like she's done this before.  I know, right?  Exactly.  Look at that.  I gotta go, guys.  Enjoy.  Oh, Jimmy.  Bobo, enjoy yourself.  We'll let this bit breathe for you, Jimmy.  Yes, this bit is definitely breathing.  Hopefully, by the end of it, Bobo won't be.  Right.  See you.  Yeah.  Oh, was that the can or Bobo?  Why isn't Bobo moving?  Bobo, you're really not...  It's like she's washing a statue.  Yeah, Bobo, you don't seem to be enjoying this.  We set this up just for you, sir. 
[01:58:00]  Bobo, play with the duck.  Play with the duck a little bit.  Huh?  Bobo, stand up so she can get the rest of you.  Stand up in the tub.  She's gotta get the rest of you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  He's poking straight out.  Oh, jeez.  There's more soap.  You liking this, Bobo?  Yeah, I'm liking this.  Bobo.  You got something going on down there, I see. 
[01:58:30]  Bobo, what's happening down there?  Which Sam is now hitting with some...  Trying to get some soap on it.  But he can't get...  Mr. Bubbles.  He's trying to drop Mr. Bubbles spray on Bobo's penis.  I think that's mostly a normal reaction.  But he can't get it past his gut.  Right.  Because it doesn't come out.  There it is.  There you go.  There it is.  It's covered with soapy stuff.  It's hanging from it.  Bobo.  There you go, Bobo.  You got soap all over your schwantz.  There you go. 
[01:59:00]  So we covered...  Oh, boy.  Now she's rubbing it.  Oh, Bobo.  How's that feel?  She's washing it.  Oh, that feels good.  Yeah, you like that?  Yep, like that.  Nice and clean.  Yeah.  Here comes Dupree.  Lexi, how's it for you?  That's hot, right?  That's hot.  She's like, it's very sexy.  Yeah.  Wow, she's a good actress.  Yeah.  That's...  Bobo, you ever had a girl this close to you when you were naked before?  Never have.  No, huh?  Never have.  How does it feel?  Feels good.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Oh, no. 
[01:59:30]  Put the...  That's a little bit crazy.  It's just a pacifier with some mollies on it.  Put the nook.  Put the nook in your mouth.  Right.  It's a little bit cold.  He's got to put the nook in his mouth.  He's shaking.  How cold is the water?  What a photo op this is.  I need some pictures.  I've got to take some pictures now because this is so fucked up.  It got real weird real quick.  It got real weird.  The fucking nook just made it really fucked up.  For those of you listening at home, it took Bobo about 45 seconds to walk into this room 
[02:00:00]  and end up naked at Tupperware.  Bobo's got a pacifier in his mouth and foam soap all over his face and head.  Sorry, we stopped talking because that's like...  Yeah, yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Sam's a consummate professional.  He'll...  By the way, for those keeping...  If you have a scorecard at home, Bobo is indeed still erect fully.  Well, we didn't need to know all the details there, sir.  Holy shit.  At Lexi Long, right? 
[02:00:30]  He's also playing with his rubber ducky.  Yeah, he's loving the rubber ducky.  He's loving the tits.  Being washed.  Bobo, did any girl...  Has never gotten that close to your wiener before, right?  No.  Wow.  That felt good.  Yeah?  What do you mean?  You're just kind of like, yeah, that felt good.  Oh, it felt great.  Yeah?  It felt great.  Did you feel anything like you were close to anything?  Yeah.  Yeah, it felt like she was close.  I put too much soap on his face.  Should we...  That's great. 
[02:01:00]  Should we wash his...  What?  His asshole?  Oh, yeah.  Bobo, how's your asshole?  Needs a good cleaning?  Is it dirty?  Yeah, Lexi, did you get the undercarriage?  Yeah, you gotta get...  I didn't get the undercarriage.  From the back.  Yeah, Bobo, you're gonna have to bend over, so Lexi...  Bobo, stand up, and then grab the front edge of the tub with your hands.  Oh, my God.  Should we turn around?  Yeah, yeah, turn around, Bobo.  Turn around. 
[02:01:30]  There you go, turn around.  Now...  Oh, jeez.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, my dear Lord.  He's spreading his cheeks.  She's washing his asshole.  Like, he really is concerned about having a proper bath here.  What are you doing?  Bobo, why are you spreading your cheeks?  No, because I guess that's what I was asked to do.  Yeah?  Is that what you were asked to do, Bobo?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bobo, what's your Twitter these days?  I don't even know.  Bobo...  Bobo...  Bobo...  XM-103-NYC. 
[02:02:00]  Bobo, what?  XM-83...  XM-103-NYC.  NYC...  That's like an impossible one to remember.  All right.  Yeah, that's too much.  I'm trying to tweet some of this shit.  Oh, my God.  You got the undercarriage?  I did.  I did.  Oh, good.  You got to get in there.  I know, but he'd have to bend over for me.  Bobo, bend over.  Bobo, she wants to get in there.  Oh, my God. 
[02:02:30]  Hold on.  I got some of that.  Wow.  Bobo, you got some...  I think you got some shit still hanging out.  He's got really bad skin tags in his armpits.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, Bobo, can we snip some of those...  Ugh.  Skin tags.  Bobo's got, like, fucking giant moose balls. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, he's got soap in his eye?  Bobo, you all right?  You're going to cry?  I'm all right.  He's like, I'm all right.  Please don't stop.  You don't want to stop, do you?  No, it's nice.  Yeah, huh?  It's nice.  Would you like to give Lexi Love a little scrubbing?  Oh, watch your eyes.  Bobo's head is being rinsed off with bottled water by Sam.  He's just squirting it in his face.  Soap all in his eyes.  And then I'm rinsing it off his face, and he goes, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, 
[02:03:30]  cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.  You got a lot of soap in your eyes.  Oh, Bobo.  She's taking care of you.  Look at this.  How nice this is.  Yeah.  What a sweet moment.  He's in a big plastic summer.  He's in a giant plastic.  Like a Rubbermaid storage bin.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, wait.  Let me see this one.  What the hell?  Oh, yeah.  I take like five, six at a clip.  He's so happy. 
[02:04:00]  He is.  Look how happy Bobo is.  Bobo, we haven't seen you happy like this in a while.  That's a nice role when you got an attractive lady like this, of course.  Oh.  Dave Herman said.  I have to take this my new profession.  Yeah, huh?  Sam keeps washing soap into Bobo's eyes from his head.  I'm trying to get it off his face.  It's just sitting on his face.  But you're putting it on his soapy head, and the soap is running right into his eyes.  He can't take care of himself.  This is so bad.  He's got a naked girl in front of him, but he can't open his eyes because they're all 
[02:04:30]  burning with soap.  He's like in hell.  Yeah.  Like she's loving it.  Would you like him to kind of give you a little?  Um, you know, I think I'm good.  You're good.  I love about like the second hand bath water.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  I would assume.  Yeah.  All right.  Now what do we do?  It looks like Bobo's washed.  I know.  Bobo's pretty washed.  All right.  Yeah.  How about we rinse him off?  He's got to be rinsed, right? 
[02:05:00]  Not really.  That's not.  Here's some more water.  I think you got to spin it, Bobo.  Get another bottle.  Our participation here is done.  We don't need to rinse him off.  He can rinse himself off.  All right.  He's standing up.  I can't even.  Oh.  What?  Oh, that made Bobo, man.  Oh, the water bottle exploded, I think.  Oh, what happened?  He squirted in that water bottle.  Wow.  That exploded, Bobo.  You all right?  I'm all right.  All right.  That's good. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  And then there's a towel.  Why is the towel covered in soap?  I used the towel to wipe off his face.  See, but now he's supposed to dry with that, but I'm just not a practical guy.  In the bin.  In the bin.  Your elbows are.  Pull your elbows into the bin.  What's the matter?  He goes, it's cold.  It's cold.  It's cold.  It's cold.  It's cold.  It's cold.  It's cold.  Oh, this is another.  It's cold.  Another amazing day at work.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wait.  There we go. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, nice.  Take some pictures, of course.  Lexi Love.  Bravo.  Nice.  Oh, hell yeah.  Gave us some good photos.  Bobo's trying to.  Good photo ops.  That's great.  Right.  His underwear is next.  Like, he reached his head out of the bin, and all the water came off of him.  His underwear is soaking wet.  All of his clothes now are soaked, and he left it right by the side of the tub.  Bobo, you're just careless.  You good, Bobo?  What's the matter?  I'm good.  What's wrong?  What's the matter? 
[02:06:30]  You're mad that it's over?  Well, obviously.  It's kind of weird yet enjoyable moment at the same time.  Oh, yeah?  Why is it weird?  I don't know.  This kind of feels weird saying, I got my son.  I got a.  Her son gave me a path on the air.  But it's like, you know, she's hot and everything.  Yeah, but yeah, that's what made it enjoyable.  You want to give her a hug now that you're nice and clean? 
[02:07:00]  Just be dry.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She's a little.  All right.  Oh, boy.  And I brought you some movies and left you a game outside.  Oh, what?  Movies of you?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Bobo.  You're going to watch.  I'll be enjoying myself to those movies tonight.  Why does his voice do that?  I don't know.  Is she a real killer part of him?  Yeah, that's a new thing.  It's really weird.  That'll be nice.  How are you going to watch that at home? 
[02:07:30]  Your mom is at home.  No, she's not around in the scene.  She's in another room.  Oh, so you go in your room.  Yeah.  And then what?  You're going to pop it on your television.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, usual.  The lube.  The lube.  Usual.  Usual.  The lube.  What, do you got lube in your room?  Yeah, I got lube.  Where did you get lube?  By wherever else you get lube.  I don't know.  The Rite Aid.  Yeah, so you go in and buy lube. 
[02:08:00]  Doesn't your mother go in your room and find your lube?  No, not where I keep it.  Where do you keep it?  I can't say that location.  Oh.  Why?  Where do you hide your lube?  It's under the mattress, isn't it?  That's sort of...  Yeah, that's sort of where it is.  But that's the first place you would look.  Don't say anything, Uncle Louie, because I know you're listening.  I know you're listening over there in Orlando.  Like, say hi to you, Uncle Louie, and the Orange County Sheriff's Department over in Florida. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, boy.  Wow, what's that about?  The charges, the allegations were false.  Wow.  So you keep your lube under your mattress, and your mother doesn't find it.  Does she clean your room?  I don't think under the mattress.  Well, does your mom make your bed?  No, I do that myself.  Oh, wow.  That I do myself.  That tradable shit's really...  Yeah, tradable.  No, I didn't have to be trained or anything to do that. 
[02:09:00]  No.  I just know how to do it.  I've just known how to do that since I was, like, 18.  Does she do your laundry?  Sometimes I do the laundry.  What if you have, like, jizz on your sheets?  Your mom's gonna be like, oh, man.  I think...  Now that's why I use napkins.  You guys are also forgetting that Bobo has said on the air that he sometimes sleeps with  a condom on.  Yeah, why do you do that, Bobo?  Oh, Bobo, why do you sometimes sleep with a condom on? 
[02:09:30]  Because I don't want to find a mess in my pants when I wake up.  Do you have a lot of wet dreams?  Yeah, that does happen time and time.  Those are good, aren't they?  Oh, man, I wish I could have those.  Those are great.  I think they happen more when I haven't got laid, ever.  I think they happen more when I haven't got laid, ever.  Is that what you just said?  Do you think you're gonna have one now, thinking of Lexi tonight?  Yeah, I might end up...  What is going on with his face? 
[02:10:00]  Look at everybody.  The morning mashups all looking in.  Bring him in.  They're looking in.  Come on in.  Oh, my God.  And I have to say this, his definitely has to be a memorable moment.  Yeah, yeah.  Nicole, what's up?  What are you guys doing with your show today?  Nicole?  I'm going to be on highlight.  Yeah, what are you doing?  You just ruined my day.  Playing the hits?  We're just playing the hits, me and the girls.  Look at what we're doing.  Look at this.  We got Lexi.  Lexi just gave Bobo a little sponge bath.  That's so sweet of you, Lexi. 
[02:10:30]  That was really sweet.  You're a better woman than me.  She washed everywhere, his undercarriage.  Bobo, take the towel down.  I don't want to see it.  Just take the towel down.  Bobo, take the towel down.  Open it up.  Open the towel up.  Take the towel down.  Take the towel down.  Open the towel up.  Take the towel down.  Come on, open it up.  I can't.  I don't want to.  I know you don't want to.  Bobo.  Bobo.  There's a lot of things we don't want to do.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  I feel like this is sexual harassment and he doesn't have to take it.  Oh, he is.  It's up to him.  Come on, Bobo. 
[02:11:00]  If he ever wants to be on the show again, he'll do it.  He looks like you want to call you.  I'm leaving now.  What happened?  Oh.  What?  That's good stuff.  This is what's actually going in the whole notebook I have written about experiences on  the show.  Oh, that's good.  It's called a manifesto.  Right.  And the news reads it after.  Well, wow.  So this has just been the most exciting day in your life, probably. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, it is.  This is.  Bigger than a Mets game?  Bigger than the 86 World Series you went to?  Yup.  Wow.  Yup.  Wow.  All right.  That is pretty good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Yeah, this is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  It is the worst of 2013, and my name is E-Rock. 
[02:12:00]  E-Rock Radio on Twitter if you care to follow.  The Opie and Anthony Show will be back January 6th, 2014, at 6 a.m.  So be there.  We have to be.  So you should be there as well.  2013 brought Toronto Mayor Rob Ford to the world stage for his antics and his comments  while he was in office.  This guy's been accused of all sorts of crazy shit, from drug use to gang associations to  inappropriate behavior and more.  This is a collection, a highlight, if you will, of all the cool things that happened while  we were watching Mayor Rob Ford. 
[02:12:30]  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Mr. Mayor, in your tenure as mayor, have you ever assaulted any of your staff?  Pause.  But I can't stress enough how nice they are when they ask these questions.  That's the best part.  Yes.  That should be a very quick no.  You should never go like, wait, have I ever assaulted my staff?  No, he loves the spotlight, though.  Why say just no when you can give a long answer with everyone just looking at you? 
[02:13:00]  In my entire tenure, I assaulted my staff.  He's thinking, have I ever done it in front of a camera where they might be able to prove it?  Of course.  That's what every question is now, is him thinking, was there a camera there?  Because that fucking camera shit fucks me.  Of course.  Hit that.  I haven't assaulted any of my staff.  Oh.  No, I don't assaulted.  No, I don't assault any of them.  I've been here 13 years, and I've never assaulted any of my staff. 
[02:13:30]  There was, and I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Mayor, there was an important newspaper that  on your St. Patrick's Day while in this building, you actually shoved one of your own staff to  the ground, and your other staff had to intervene and hold you back.  You're saying that that...  That, you know what, then you might talk to the person, if you believe everything you  read, Councillor...  Uh-oh.  Well, I believe everything I read about you.  That might be a problem, but I think you should talk to whoever these allegations are  made about, I think you should talk to that individual. 
[02:14:00]  About it?  Because I think you're referring to the St. Patrick's Day party I had in my office.  That was very...  A lot of that stuff in there, the media was completely wrong, and...  He's having St. Patrick's Day parties in his office.  That wasn't very accurate how they reported.  Some of it was true, and some of it was false.  He's the best!  And he's arrogant.  Oh, yeah.  He's really arrogant.  Oh, yeah, he is.  He ain't stepping down.  Like, he's mad that they're asking him, like, you shouldn't believe me.  If you believe everything you read, there's video of him cracked up. 
[02:14:30]  Right.  On crack, and, like, he's mad that they believe that he shoved someone at a party in St.  Paddy's Day.  And he's just throwing St. Paddy's Day parties in his office?  How great is that?  This guy is the absolute greatest.  Go down.  There's, like, a bunch of clips on the side a little further down.  There he is up top.  Wow, yours is...  Why is yours...  It's deaf, all right?  Oh, click on, click on...  Yeah, click on that.  And then on the left side, there's, like, three more clips.  Go with...  I'm not a drug addict.  I think there's more on that one.  Mayor Rob Ford, who admitted smoking crack cocaine in a drunken stupor, is now facing... 
[02:15:00]  Stupor.  ...saying that he's become a...  ...believe that what is about to happen should happen.  A boot.  And, um...  I'm sorry that you have gone through a turmoil in your life...  Sorry.  ...such as this.  And I ask these questions of you because I care.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Listen to this.  To have an intervention for the mayor of Florida.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's amazing.  The questions that, um... 
[02:15:30]  ...should question themselves.  Mr. Mayor, do you think you have an addiction problem with alcohol?  Absolutely not.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, that's obvious.  Mr. Mayor, do you think you have an addiction problem with substance abuse and illicit drugs?  Absolutely not.  All right.  Good by me.  Mr. Mayor, do you recognize that some of your behavior points to that?  I apologize for it.  Shut up. 
[02:16:00]  Depends how you interpret my hand.  Maybe you have a couple of isolated incidents.  Ha, ha, ha.  I'm smoking crack.  And yelling that you're going to kill somebody.  He's the best.  The arrogance of this guy is great.  I couldn't get enough of this yesterday.  And his suit jacket, he can't even, like, button it.  His tie isn't tied right now.  Would he survive...  He's obviously going to be done soon.  But would he survive this if he came out and go, I have a problem and I need help?  Hell no.  No one understands shit.  I mean, in Toronto, they're so nice up there. 
[02:16:30]  And the way they're talking to him, would there be a way for him to skate this if he came clean about everything?  Not even rehab because you have to do your duty.  Or maybe if you did...  Do your duty.  They want him out.  They're just way more polite about it.  They absolutely want the guy out.  And they can't kick him out.  And they're saying that they need to make new legislation so they can kick him out.  So now they were looking at trying to figure out the new legislation.  And then officially they could say, you've got to fucking go.  They don't want him around at all.  How much time does he have left before he'd have to leave anyway? 
[02:17:00]  I don't know, to be honest.  That'd be great.  I'm very proud of Rob Ford's law.  The law that says that you can now throw people out of office.  That'll be his legacy.  Right.  If they were caught smoking crack.  Yes.  Keep going there, Sam.  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  Oh, he's arrogant.  Oh, he's the best.  Okay, Councillor Mamalee, please speak to the mayor.  I'm trying to...  Madam Speaker, this is a very serious issue.  Okay.  I just... 
[02:17:30]  Okay.  I can understand how people would perceive my behavior.  I can understand that.  Can you?  Because I put myself in the shoes of the taxpayers.  If they were to look at the few incidents that we've had, I could understand.  They would say, he may have a problem.  I can assure you.  I can assure you.  I am not an alcoholic.  I am not a drug addict.  Have I drank?  Have I done drugs?  Yes, I have.  It's self-inflicted.  And I hope... 
[02:18:00]  Councillor Mamalee, I hope...  I hope...  That nobody...  Nobody.  ...that nobody goes through what I have gone through in the last few months.  It's him.  He...  You know, what I went through.  You understand that there are some people on this council floor that really want to give  you an opportunity and to recognize that perhaps the stress and everything else that  comes along with...  Addiction.  Addictions.  Ah, yes.  Possible addictions.  Possible.  Points to particular behavior.  Mr. Mayor, do you recognize there are a few of us that really do want to help you? 
[02:18:30]  Counselor?  I don't need help.  It was not...  The reason I drank or did drugs was not because of stress.  It was out of sheer stupidity.  That's all it was.  So I'm not going to blame something.  When he puts his hands together...  Yes.  ...and he talks, like, with that emphasis, he looks like Chris Farley in Tommy Boy.  Oh, fuck that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  With his suit jacket kind of stretching over.  Free and sincere and putting his fingertips...  He puts just his fingertips together and kind of shakes his hands at you. 
[02:19:00]  A lot of the Canadians check in and they're saying that Parliament absolutely wants him  out.  Of course they do.  But a lot of the people don't want him out.  That's why I'm wondering...  Because I guess he has done some great things for Toronto.  His suit jacket won't even button.  No.  That's what I said.  Not even close.  If anyone, by the way, out there wonders, what is denial in an addiction?  I just want to do this.  That's right.  You'll never see a better example of denial.  Yeah, yeah.  Just show this and it's a prime example.  And this is how...  Everyone who's in denial out there, this is exactly how obvious your shit is to people  around you.  Keep going. 
[02:19:30]  I'm not going to use an excuse or a cop-out.  I take full responsibility for my mistakes.  I don't know what else I can say.  Okay.  I don't know what else I can say.  Okay.  Okay.  There is no one else.  No one else to blame but myself.  There isn't anyone else to admit it except yourself.  And I admitted it over and over.  And I wasn't forced to admit it.  I came out and I told the world, and I know I embarrassed the city.  He lied about it before.  And then he goes, I know I embarrassed the city.  There had to be...  Not only did there have to be announcements that there is tape, the tape had to surface 
[02:20:00]  before you even accomplished that.  And then he used semantics saying, well, you didn't ask the question properly.  Yeah.  And that's on you, not me.  Yeah.  You asked me, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Right.  And you should have asked me, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  So, uh...  Run the show.  This is the longer clip, because he just...  He walks out of his office with his football jersey on, and he has a laundry list of things  he needs to get off his chest.  He's got to address things.  And the first...  Bullet points for the day. 
[02:20:30]  Bullet points for the day.  I just love how matter-of-fact he is.  Yeah.  The first couple are like, whatever, and then we get to the gold, obviously.  The meat.  Poor wife.  Oh, he's fucking...  Why would he say his wife?  You can't throw your wife under the bus like that.  I would love to see that, like, when he saw his wife right after that.  She was probably livid.  I don't know, man.  What the fuck are you doing?  I think Rob Ford found a cool woman to marry.  I don't know.  She was standing there.  He's a lot of smoke crack.  He's a lot of threatened people.  She's standing next to him as he's apologizing. 
[02:21:00]  Making the Michaela Maroney face.  Right.  Making that, hmm, hmm.  She's married to a fat crack smoker.  Yes.  She understands his problems.  Oh, okay.  Maybe she knows.  He's obese and he's a crack smoker.  If he's a crack, I mean...  Oh, he is.  He smokes crack.  Oh, yeah.  A lot.  He has.  He definitely has.  Dude, when someone says...  He has all his teeth and he's still at a weight that is substantial as far as crack using  goes.  Because coming down, he probably eats a lot. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  It probably helps him binge.  I think he probably smokes some of the dope, too.  Yeah, probably.  That's where he gets the munchies.  You know why his wife's not mad at him?  Because of the way he resolves all his arguments with her.  Eating her pussy.  That's right.  Yeah.  Let's play the clip.  Let's do this.  I've had enough.  That's why I warned you guys yesterday.  Be careful what you wrote.  Okay?  So that's all I have to say for now.  And the next thing, I want to call Mayor Britannia in Hamilton and tell him that we're  going to have to spank the little tiger cats. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, and the last thing was Olivia Gondack.  It says that I wanted to eat her pussy.  Olivia Gondack.  I've never said that in my life to her.  I would never do that.  I'm happily married.  I've got more than enough to eat at home.  Wait, wait, wait.  Go back.  I mean, obviously, we've got to laugh.  But the guy in the background makes the clip.  Because what did he say?  So I'm like, what did he just say?  Listen to the background.  Also, for those of you playing along at home, maybe with the clip, the reaction by the reporters, 
[02:22:30]  especially the women, there's one Asian woman that just turns around like she can't imagine  what just happened.  She can't find a Wi-Fi fast enough to get this clip up there.  Stunned.  Here, play it again.  Listen to the guy in the background.  He says, go ahead.  Olivia Gondack.  It says that I wanted to eat her pussy.  Olivia Gondack.  I've never said that in my life to her.  I would never do that.  I'm happily married.  I've got more than enough to eat at home.  Thank you very much.  Why would he say anything that was real?  Don't say that. 
[02:23:00]  Don't say that.  It's all right.  It's all right.  Why would he say that?  Why would he say that?  And then he just turns around and marches back to that office with two thugs, basically.  Yeah, yeah.  He's coming apart.  Two big time, big, huge, burly security guards.  Here's the thing with that clip.  You should know you shouldn't say that in front of the press.  Like, he doesn't even know that that's crazy to say?  He knows.  Does he? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  When he gets back into his office, before he reads the feedback, is he thinking, good,  resolve that.  I got that out there.  We're not dealing with a dummy here.  I think he's highly intelligent.  Yeah, but I think he's a little crazy.  Well, he's a bit self-destructive, obviously.  If you're smoking crack when you're in a position like him, you have some self-destruction in your brain.  Right.  So that's part of it.  But he's fully aware of what he's doing.  Is he a good mayor?  The people, supposedly, I've done a little research. 
[02:24:00]  Supposedly, they love him because their taxes went down, which is very rare.  Like him.  Because he eats pussy.  That completely sums up what the people want.  You can eat all the pussy you want.  You can smoke crack.  You can threaten people in the city council.  Just lower my taxes.  Just lower taxes.  That's all we need.  Right.  We're very forgiving.  Yeah.  Hold on.  People are picking out individual voices.  Finn and PA.  Go ahead.  You listen to the very last part of that clip.  All the way at the end, there's one reporter that says, I fucking love this guy. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's play it again.  We got to be very quiet so we can hear this.  Thank you.  Little tiger cats.  Oh, and the last thing was Olivia Gondack.  It says that I wanted to eat her pussy.  Olivia Gondack.  I've never said that in my life tour.  I would never do that.  I'm happily married.  I've got more than enough to eat at home.  Thank you very much.  Anything that was true.  Say that.  We need to drive it.  We need to drive it.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  Oh, my God. 
[02:25:00]  Can you kill me?  We might be going to slide.  Thanks.  I love that guy.  I love that guy.  Did you hear the laughter that came from them?  Oh, is that great?  I love that guy.  I love that guy.  God, is he embarrassing his city?  Oh, he's the best.  I love him.  I absolutely love him. 
[02:25:30]  Yesterday, I mentioned it was the second worst day of my life, except for the death of my father.  Well, we're going to have to push it back.  In the past six months, I have been under tremendous, tremendous stress.  Stress is largely of my own making.  I have apologized, and I have tried to move forward.  This has proven to be almost impossible. 
[02:26:00]  Also, the revelations yesterday of cocaine, escorts, and prostitution has pushed me over the line.  Pause.  And I use...  This is just amazing.  We've been doing this a long fucking time, and every once in a while, you get one of these stories that just has a life of their own.  This is one of the best ones ever.  You know why?  It never gets this far in the United States.  Right.  This guy would have been fucking gone already.  Sure.  And this is what happens when you allow this to play out. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  It just is entertaining for everybody.  Yeah, let it play out, because this guy's just fucking every day.  This is way better than any TV show you could fucking watch tonight.  And I used unforgivable language.  And again, I apologize.  Again, again.  These allegations are 100% lies.  When you attack my integrity as a father and as a husband, I see red.  Pink is on a period.  Today, I acted on complete impulse in my remarks. 
[02:27:00]  I fully realize in the past, I have drank alcohol in excess.  In the past?  In excess.  In the past few hours, maybe.  And then he was doing a little Kuwait comparison.  He's brilliant.  Yeah.  Mediaite.  Rob Ford is not long enough. 
[02:27:30]  Crack-smoking mayor, it says.  The opposition, I want people to listen to me tonight from 8 to 9 on Sun News.  He's plugging.  They're all laughing.  He's killing.  You will get my side of the story.  Okay?  Unfiltered.  This, folks, reminds me of when, when I was watching with my brother, when Saddam attacked Kuwait. 
[02:28:00]  And President Bush said, I warn you, I warn you, I warn you, I warn you, do not.  Well, folks, if you think American-style politics is nasty, you guys have just attacked Kuwait.  And you will never, and you will never, and you will never see something that you have marked my words, friends. 
[02:28:30]  Uh-oh.  This is going to be outright war in the next election.  And I'm going to do everything in my power.  Okay, Mayor Ford, your time's up.  Everything in my power to beat you guys.  Thank you, Mayor Ford.  And most of the way you're doing to me is taking me out of my office.  He turned his mic off.  And the worst thing that you can do, I was elected by the people.  Mayor Ford.  You're absolutely right on that.  Because every one of you guys have said.  Mayor Ford, your time's up.  And it is absolutely the worst thing you can do for democracy. 
[02:29:00]  Thank you.  In the city of Trump.  Thank you.  When it comes around, it comes around, friends.  Remember what I'm saying.  Why are they allowed to strip him of his powers if he wasn't?  It's probably a technicality.  Yeah, they found some way to.  They voted on something that they probably never would have considered.  Right.  Because they can't remove him, but they can probably do this, this, and this,  which blocks his path everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  They look through so many legal books and stuff. 
[02:29:30]  But there's no criminal complaint.  Yeah.  So that's why they probably can't just boot him.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  I mean, here he'd be out.  I think here the press is a lot worse here, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They would eat him alive.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're doing a number on him in the American news anyway.  We forgot to talk about Rob Ford imitating a drunk driver, too.  Oh, yeah.  They're playing it on CNN right now.  And then here he is running around and grabs the lady to make sure she doesn't fall down. 
[02:30:00]  We'll report that accurately.  Oh, boy.  He's so animated.  Take a look.  Wow.  From the outside, it seems like you are a man under tremendous burdens this week.  How has it been?  How has this week been for you?  It's all self-inflicted.  You know, it's my fault.  I made mistakes.  You own up to it.  You move on.  And so, in his very next breath, Rob Ford moves on. 
[02:30:30]  I went down to City Hall.  I've cleaned it up.  These people just aren't happy.  These counselors want me out.  The media wants me out.  Out.  I told the chief of police I want efficiencies, you know.  Obviously, he wants me out.  I'm not going anywhere.  The setting for this interview is more than a little surreal.  This is the rec room of a suburban Toronto housing project, and it is filled with loyal  and vocal members of Ford Nation.  Things start relatively sedate, but when I ask why he decided to admit his crack use 
[02:31:00]  after months of denial, he gets so angry he forgets who's in the room.  I just had enough.  I was sick and tired of all these allegations and all this, excuse my words, and that's  all it is.  Sorry, kids.  I shouldn't have sworn in front of the kids.  But I know what I'm doing is right.  I'm serving the people.  I'm saving taxpayers money.  You know what?  I made mistakes.  I drank too much.  I smoke some crack sometimes.  What can I say?  I made a mistake.  I'm human.  How do we find ourselves in the middle of a Rob Ford rant? 
[02:31:30]  In the middle of the project?  Interesting story.  It actually started on AC360 Friday night.  After some give and take with the mayor's counselor brother, Doug, we were about to say goodbye  when he floated an offer.  And we look forward to having you by Toronto one day.  I'll take you up on that.  And 18 hours later, I found myself unloading toys from Doug Ford's SUV outside the Queens  plate housing projects in the heart of their war.  But as we wait for the mayor, Doug's unscripted style of public relation takes a turn when  a longtime resident named Ken wanders over to complain about a threatened eviction and 
[02:32:00]  a run-in with the cops.  And as the counselor politely tries to nudge him to the door, he says this.  I know a lot of friends that bought hash from you, actually.  Yeah, okay.  Well, that's good.  That's good.  That's good.  Because he has been fighting those allegations since May, when the Toronto Globe and  Mail dug into the Ford family's checkered past and reported that Doug spent much of  the 80s as a mid-level hashish dealer.  That's not the first time that I've heard the allegations that your youth is... 
[02:32:30]  Oh, boy.  No, I wasn't slinging any hash.  I said it very clearly.  30 years ago, 31 years ago, I smoked marijuana.  And I didn't deal marijuana.  In downtown Toronto, Mayor Rob Ford is the target of almost daily protests.  Boy, it has to go!  Worst council floor of City Hall.  He is a political pariah.  Jay!  Jay!  Have you purchased illegal drugs in the last two years?  Yes, I have. 
[02:33:00]  That's the bottom line, so...  And that's the bottom line!  His brother invited us here to witness this love, a counterweight to the gauntlet of political  foes downtown, doing all they can to strip away his power to lead.  I'm interested in what happened this week about the vote.  It was 41 to 2 to strip you of your emergency powers.  From the outside, that seems like you guys are political outcasts.  Okay, sure, because I'm like...  You know how you want to make friends at City Hall?  Just keep spending their money.  Spend taxpayers' money.  Let them go on their free trips. 
[02:33:30]  Let them have their free food.  Let them do whatever they want.  Do what you want with your money, not with taxpayers' money, then turn around and cry poor.  Do you have any political allies left?  Did you ever have any?  No, we never had any in the beginning.  We have the power of the people.  Well, I'll tell you one thing.  I'll work day in and day out to knock these councillors off.  I'm going to target their areas and work day in and day out to knock them off.  Really?  Oh yeah, and I'm going to bring Ford Nation live, just all right across the city.  Ford Nation.  So you have other candidates that you are going to foster in these wards to try to repeat 
[02:34:00]  what you guys have done?  100%.  Really?  Yeah.  We're going to hit them hard.  Everything we got.  We make Chicago politics look like a tea party.  It's vicious.  Bill, you show me one other major city, I've saved a billion dollars, that has turned it  around like I have.  Our roads are getting done now.  It's clean.  It's safe.  The crime's down.  Things are happening.  We have more cranes in the sky.  We have more jobs.  We created over 50,000 jobs in one year last year.  But take all of that, given you all of that, couldn't you be even more effective if you're 
[02:34:30]  a little healthier in your last time?  Oh, I'm trying to lose some weight.  I'm working out.  It doesn't mean like that.  I'm going to see some addiction specialists just to make sure.  I'm not an addict.  Bill Weir.  CNN Toronto.  He is really belligerent.  Oh, wow.  It is a bit of a laugh or cry moment, I think you have to say.  Because you don't really know what to make about it.  It's a laugh or laugh.  It's just a laugh.  All laughs.  It's that his term ends next year, and they've stripped him of all of his powers, basically.  It's going to be a long year, though.  I mean, think about it.  And the thing I do wonder is what changes will be made, if they can, or if they will implement 
[02:35:00]  any changes to way...  All right.  And then it gets boring.  That's fucking great, man.  That's where we tap out.  And then it gets boring.  God, he's great.  His quotes are fantastical.  Wonderful.  Go back to Rob Ford in the Matt Lauer interview.  This is your Rob Ford clip of the day.  Where were we on this?  I guess we're going to have to go all the way back.  What was he talking about?  Matt had...  He said he disgraced the office.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Let's hit this. 
[02:35:30]  You said as we were sitting down here, so what happened in city council chambers is  unprecedented.  It's never happened before.  What went on in there?  They basically took away 383,000 people who voted for me.  You have brought disgrace to this office, and you know that's true.  I'm embarrassed.  Not just myself, my family, my friends, my supporters, the whole city.  I take full responsibility for that.  We've all made mistakes, Matt. 
[02:36:00]  I'm not perfect.  Maybe you are.  Maybe other people are.  Nice.  That's right.  I've made mistakes.  I admitted to my mistakes.  When the questions began to circulate around you, Mr. Mayor, and people started to ask  you about the use of crack cocaine, you played a game of semantics.  They asked you were you a crack addict, according to you, and you said no.  I'm not.  And they said, do you use crack cocaine?  No, I don't use crack cocaine.  No.  Have I tried crack cocaine? 
[02:36:30]  Yes, I've tried crack cocaine.  That's a game of semantics.  The best excuse I heard you give for using that crack cocaine was I was in a drunken stupor.  And I'm wondering, is that supposed to make anybody feel better?  No, not at all.  But show me the video, even according.  What does the video matter?  Because I want to see it, because according, I can't even remember it.  I was very, very inebriated.  I just want to make sure we all understand.  You're not in any alcohol treatment program.  No.  I'm not in alcohol treatment program.  You're not in any drug treatment program.  I have a weight issue.  I've been training every day. 
[02:37:00]  All I can say, Matt, action speaks thousand words.  Oh, this guy's the best.  I invite you to come back.  Give me five.  Give me five or six months.  And if they don't see a difference, I'll eat my word.  It's very simple.  Show me any man in North America right this second that has done what he has done.  He saved the taxpayers a billion dollars.  Councilman, I would expect you to sit here and defend your brother.  I'm telling you facts.  I know.  I think it's loyal, and I think it's wonderful.  I'm telling you facts.  Have you ever been worried about him? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, his weight issues.  When he goes on a binge.  When he goes on a binge.  If you want to call it a binge drinking.  And I hear about it.  Yeah, it's concerning.  Binge drinking.  Do I know on a personal side?  Has Rob been 100% honest?  No, he hasn't.  Your brother brings up something interesting, Mr. Mayor.  Because you say you go out on a weekend and you maybe go on a little binge.  Every once in a while.  Not every weekend.  Not every weekend.  I said every once in a while.  Let's retract that.  That's the wrong word to use.  He goes, let's retract that. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, I shouldn't have said binge.  I shouldn't have said binge.  Oh, boy.  Is this dumb?  That was a great question by that.  Yes, yes.  He's a very good interviewer.  Yeah, I'll say that.  I said, your brother said you go out on a weekend, you may go on a binge every once in a while.  Not every weekend.  Absolutely.  Let's say you go on one of those binges and the phone rings in your office at 3 a.m. on a Saturday night.  Have you heard this yet?  And something terrible has happened in the city of Toronto.  Oh, wait.  Terrorist attack, some other kind of disaster.  Are you equipped?  I'm very fortunate.  Will you be capable and stable enough to handle it?  I'm very fortunate that hasn't happened.  It's very few isolated incidents that's happened. 
[02:38:30]  And you're absolutely right.  I'm very fortunate that hasn't happened.  But that could happen with anybody at any time.  And say you were gone out drinking or you were drunk and say something happened to your family.  Hold on.  The lives of a million people aren't resting on my decisions.  Hold on.  Say your son or daughter just got killed in a car accident and you're plopped out of your mind at 3 in the morning.  Are you going to be able to handle that?  I would take personal responsibility for my family.  You've got taxpayers and residents of this city depending on you. 
[02:39:00]  And I take personal responsibility for them, too.  Do you still want this job?  Absolutely.  October 27th, let the people decide.  What if they say, we want another guy like Rob Ford when it comes to the fiscal responsibility,  but we want a guy who's going to elevate the office and not bring the baggage that Mayor Ford brought.  They're not going to find another Rob Ford.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was a good job by Matt.  Jesus.  Really good job by Matt Lauer.  I like his little scenario there. 
[02:39:30]  Wow.  Jesus.  Brutal scenario.  I'm going to throw back at the interviewer.  You're plastered out of your mind.  What a terrible thing, though.  What if your kids died?  What?  Jesus Christ.  Come on there, Rob.  We're all having fun here.  It's not about me.  Really?  It's about you.  Have a drink, buddy.  Family?  It's about fucking national security.  I don't know.  He is, I mean, denials the word I guess everybody's using, right?  And that beard looks pretty fucking stupid there, Lauer. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  What happens if you're hammered, plastered, and they say, you got to shave that beard for  your TV show, Matt, and you cut yourself shaven because you're hammered drunk on a binge like  my dumb brother said.  If you want to call it a binge.  You know, yeah.  I worry about my brother sometimes.  He's got the binge.  He drinks like a fucking fish.  He's stumbling.  Let's fast forward to that car ride home.  Why the fuck did you say binge? 
[02:40:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You should have said no.  You don't say binge.  You don't need to worry about me.  Sorry, Rab.  I'm not as good as you are with these fucking prick reporters.  That's all right.  Let's go have a drink.  Why did you say binge?  You're lucky I didn't come back with, you know, you and your hashish.  Yeah, that conversation's got to be great.  I love it.  That's the show.  Oh, yeah.  Next time you say I binge, I'm going to rat out you on your fucking hash. 
[02:41:00]  News report.  Rob Ford wiretaps reveal.  I just hope people got the subtleties of it.  No, I don't think they did.  He smoked more crack.  So they wiretapped a dude, and they know he smoked more crack than what he's admitting to.  Right, because they have piles of wiretapped conversations that they're now slowly taking  those black, you know, they put black bars over the stuff that you can't see.  Yes.  Yes.  They're now slowly releasing more and more without the black bars. 
[02:41:30]  And so every time they do that, there's all this great new information.  Ah.  Because they wiretapped the gang members that he was associated with.  Oh, gang members.  So he hung out with them more than once.  Well, that's what they're saying.  And Rob Ford's saying that's not true.  Yeah, but Rob Ford's saying a lot.  Well, this has proven that he might be a liar.  Redacted.  Yes.  That's it.  Redacted.  And he tried to buy the video.  They got him on tape trying to buy the video from the homies?  They have on tape the homies saying that he tried to buy the video.  Okay.  Yeah, because why would you try to buy the video? 
[02:42:00]  They can make copies.  So who are we going to hear on this tape?  It's a newscast.  Right.  Given the details.  Okay.  Rob Ford had nothing to say leaving his office this evening.  Have you done heroin airport?  Justin.  Oh, God.  And he gets into the elevator doing his laughing like, what a ridiculous question.  Come on.  Lobby.  Lobby.  Lobby.  It's not shutting.  I want to hang out in that lobby for a week.  The reporters just hang out and wait for him to leave. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Oh, it seems like a party.  An hour after a judge released more pages from those police surveillance documents that have plagued him for weeks.  The previously redacted sections are police summaries of wiretap conversations between alleged gang members.  Police began to hear them talking about Mayor Rob Ford.  On March 27, 2013, Mohamed Syed talked about receiving an offer to purchase the video of the mayor smoking crack. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, he said, I'll give you $5,000 and a car.  Syed then suggested the video was worth $150,000.  Damn.  In interview after interview, Ford said he smoked crack only once.  Crack while you've been mayor?  Yes.  More than once?  Oh.  No.  This is an isolated incident.  I still look at it like you fell on a crack pipe.  The video of Ford was made in February, but the new wiretap summaries suggest gang members were talking about delivering drugs to Ford at this home, which police call a crack house, on April 20th. 
[02:43:30]  Liban Syed tells a friend, the mayor of the city, Rob Ford, was smoking his rocks today.  Andy said another alleged gang member claimed to have pictures of Ford doing the heza, a street term for harrowing.  The heza.  The heza.  Yeah.  Doing the heza.  Hey, Rob.  Nice.  Rob Ford on fucking Worldstar.  But I do, I really do love the media and the way they're like, aha, we know that the guy lied about doing crack more than once. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, no one has ever done crack once unless they died doing it the first time.  Yeah.  Right.  No one.  This is not a fucking, you know.  They also said that on the tape, it is implicated that one of Rob Ford's advisors, because the gang member that allegedly shot this video was murdered.  Yeah.  And apparently one of the people who worked for Rob Ford told the gang members or implied that, hey, you know, you saw what happened to that guy that shot the video.  No, but then they said the police report showed that the guy just died in a gang related incident and had nothing to do with it. 
[02:44:30]  It had nothing to do with it.  Yeah, yeah.  Rob Ford's people were just trying to be like, hey, look how powerful we can be.  Look out.  So now what happens with this Rob Ford?  He laughs it off.  He's going to run for mayor next term.  Oh, he's going to run.  Yeah.  Look, he's lowering taxes.  Yep.  That's all the people want.  All right.  That's the latest on Rob Ford.  Damn.  Lots of crack.  Hair on.  Right.  There'll always be stories coming out about this guy.  He's had a checkered past, I guess you could call it. 
[02:45:00]  And present.  Yeah.  And present and future.  Yeah.  He had a checkered Tuesday.  I wonder if there's any chance of him winning if he runs again.  Zero.  You don't think so?  Zero.  You don't think people would be like, ah, fuck it.  No.  They should.  Hey, vote for him for a goof.  Right.  They should do that.  Yeah.  If he did it once, they might have.  But this is, everyone knows there's so much more and it's so dirty.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, one incident people can really overlook.  If all of a sudden he had done it once and went to rehab or got help. 
[02:45:30]  And, you know, eh.  And he has time on his side.  Because a year would go by where they know he only did it once and then he's a good boy  since then.  But he's not even trying to lose weight.  He was seen eating chicken wings at the Bills game up there in Toronto this past week.  He's an indulgent piggy boy.  Of course.  Oh, he is a piggy boy.  Those are gang members.  He's posing with gang members.  You can't pose with gang members.  No.  You can't even do that if you have a radio show.  Yeah, and a mayor.  You can't be the mayor posing with gang members. 
[02:46:00]  You guys don't think about that, you guys.  Yeah, flipping the bird at the camera.  Right.  As if to say, fuck you, I'm in a gang and this is the mayor of Toronto.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Oh, that's fucking great.  That's the very gang that allegedly sold him crack.  Right.  And did it with him on video.  Allegedly.  Wow.  I guess there's the goof factor of voting him in and then there's the, hey, I guess the  mayor, you know, we really kind of want a mayor that might get some stuff done.  Then again, if he's lowering taxes. 
[02:46:30]  He doesn't have a shot.  Oh, I know, but.  That'll be his whole campaign platform, though.  It's going to be, wow, you think I lowered taxes last time?  I'm going to really lower them.  Look at my record.  Yeah.  Do you care?  I mean, your taxes are lower.  Your lives are better.  I know.  I've made mistakes.  I said I've made mistakes.  Haven't you?  Goofy.  A lot of guys have made mistakes and not lowered your taxes, but I did.  And I'll lower them some more, but without the mistakes this time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what he'd say.  That's a guarantee.  I didn't know that you shouldn't smoke crack at my age. 
[02:47:00]  No one told me.  That has not been talked about publicly, that crack might be addictive.  I did not hear one rap song in the 80s.  Also, for what it's worth, I was very, very drunk.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's worth.  This is hilariously bad.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013.  2013.  2013.  Coming up.  Welcome back to the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:47:30]  Hope you've been enjoying it.  We're on day eight of a 10-day series here for you.  My name is Iraq, and 2013 was an interesting year for a lot of people, but also including myself.  Now, you heard me earlier in the year with the tequila and donut day.  Everybody loved that.  They thought it was awesome and great, whatever.  I mean, I'm glad you enjoyed it.  But we're moving now to a portion where I was on vacation at the beginning of October, and something happened. 
[02:48:00]  Something got screwed up.  They were looking for something.  I don't know, but they wound up calling me.  They do this every time I take a day off or go on vacation.  But they let my phone number go out over the air.  This caused a lot of fucking problems.  And then you'll hear that portion, and then jumping to when Opie is trying to make good for what happened with my phone number on the air.  Decides to pay off my vacation, but he does so in traditional Opie style.  The worst of 2013.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  In honor of Janis Joplin's death, we got to play Anthony's mom singing Bobby McGee. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, my God.  I think it's a must.  Do we have that little clip?  Remember that?  I don't disagree.  That's another clip.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We haven't played in a while.  That was a...  That certainly could be a nugget on the Opie and Anthony podcast.  That was a good one.  The old karaoke.  Oh, boy.  You got that.  I thought I did.  I don't...  Eric must have...  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock's like fucking...  Why would it be in Dillette?  In more ways than one, he's like fucking Newman in Jurassic Park. 
[02:49:00]  Can you put it on the line, Sam?  Uh, uh, uh, uh.  Seems like...  Uh, uh.  Seems like all our shit is online.  Of course, he's got the Drew Boogie edited version, but I don't know why.  That's kind of fun, too, but...  Well, I don't know.  I think we want the raw version today.  Yeah.  If he could find it.  If he wasn't vacationing, we would have it.  We might have to call E-Rock on vacation.  I needed something from him.  I emailed him yesterday.  Did he get back to you?  No, I emailed him late, so he probably didn't see it yet. 
[02:49:30]  He should get back to you, though.  He's quite busy.  Might be making love...  What's he doing?  ...to a sandwich.  He's in fucking...  Let's see.  He's in taking up a lot of Space Mountain.  Put into an automated voice messaging system.  Damn it.  2-0-1 is not available.  Oh.  E-Rock.  At the tone, please record your message.  Is that his number?  When you finish recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more.  No way. 
[02:50:00]  I don't think...  I don't think that will get it.  I think that was a little late.  Oh, no.  What did you do?  I think he just gave out E-Rock's phone number.  No one's going to believe I didn't mean to do that.  Fuck.  I was looking going...  I swear I didn't mean to do that.  I'm on...  I thought you were letting the numbers play out.  No, man.  He is going to kill you.  Fuck.  Nobody will call.  Oh, no.  I'm on so much algae shit. 
[02:50:30]  Do you want it taken out of the replay?  Of course.  Maybe.  Oh, my God.  It's too late.  It's going to be on Twitter.  It's going to be on every website.  It's going to just fucking...  And believe me, the listeners will be so nice to him.  Hey, fatty.  How many slobos is he going to get?  You're pushing it forward now, sir.  I didn't give it out.  You're pushing it forward.  You know how many messages?  You have 163 messages. 
[02:51:00]  Slobos.  Slobos.  Slobos.  Slobos.  Slobos.  Slobos.  Slobos.  Slobos.  Slobos.  Did we get it in time?  Oh, my Lord.  I don't think so.  We rarely hit that dump button.  I hit it for all it was worth, and I don't think...  Ask the people down below.  Or are they listening to the...  No, they listen to the direct feed, so no matter what, they're going to get it.  Seriously?  They get it through my headphones.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't mean to do that. 
[02:51:30]  He's not going to believe me, but he's not.  I literally thought you were just teasing it, like giving out the first three.  No, I wasn't.  I was thinking about what I wanted to say.  I had some terrific things to say in his voicemail that would have made everyone laugh.  Hopefully.  What were you thinking as the numbers go out?  I was just thinking.  I was focusing on what...  Were you phasing?  I knew what I wanted to say.  It doesn't matter anymore.  Oh, no.  I have to know what you were going to say now.  No, it doesn't matter.  Oh, my God.  I'll go check if it made it through or not.  He's going to have to change this.  What do you mean?  They already said it through that part.  That's all that matters.  That part is enough. 
[02:52:00]  Well, not really.  Really?  Yeah, they're pretty cool.  They're the elite.  Well, tell the elite to do the right thing, please.  Yeah, they could be nice.  See?  We can be nice.  I'm begging, actually, because I really did not mean to do that.  That's really shitty.  Oh, boy.  That's really shitty to me.  Fuck.  He's going to have to change his number now.  Oh, no.  He's never going to believe you didn't do that on purpose. 
[02:52:30]  I know.  He's going to think.  I know.  Why?  Why would my number two hero do that to me?  It made it on air, according to Twitter.  Uh-oh.  According to Twitter, as they quote the number?  No, no, no.  I heard it in my car, and I can rewind it to hear it again.  Oh, no.  That's right.  Kevin O'Brien.  I've already tried to call him ten times.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  This is bad, Opie. 
[02:53:00]  This is bad.  Fuck.  Oh, well.  Oh, boy.  Sam, are you upset that it went out over the air?  It's unfortunate that it went out over the air.  That's pretty funny.  Somebody says he's going to change his outgoing voicemail message to Opie's phone number.  Oh, shit.  If you're trying to get in touch with me, please call me.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Slobo. 
[02:53:30]  He's never going to believe.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Someone on Twitter said,  definitely just left message saying,  the opster sent me, Slobo.  Oh, no.  Look at this.  Please do not send, do not text Slobo cockpicks.  What are you doing?  I'm just reading people's, like, they want to help.  And they're saying what not to do with his number.  You're pushing this forward.  But I'm going to get so much shit. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's already a meme.  Oh, no.  It's a topless picture of E-Rock.  It's got his phone number at the top, and then it says,  call me, ladies.  Oh, no.  Disney vacation is ruined.  It's ruined.  He'll be trying to just, like, you know, figure out what to do. 
[02:54:30]  When all these texts will pop up.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  That's great.  Wonderful.  They'll be nice to him, I'm sure.  Always in it.  I'm always in it.  Always in.  Always bad.  Oh, Jordy Verrill.  Yes.  You know what's real funny?  There's three dump buttons.  You got one.  I don't have one.  Yes, you do.  It's on the board. 
[02:55:00]  It's on the board.  It says dump.  Where?  I don't have one.  I swear to God, I did not know this.  Yeah, you have one over there.  Yes, I do.  Where?  Oh, right there.  Does that work?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, I had no idea.  I'm serious.  I had no idea.  Oh, jeez.  Where's the third one?  Oh, so you're saying nobody hit it.  No one hit it.  No one hit it.  Yes.  I wasn't sure if I, like, I thought it was a bit.  I honestly didn't think it was a bit.  I swear it was a bit.  I thought it was a bit.  I swear. 
[02:55:30]  No, I thought it was like a fake note.  I thought you were like, oh, I'll call E-Rock and you dialed, like, some fucking store somewhere  and the numbers started coming up.  Look, I have no problem making it hurt.  I think most people know that, but I absolutely did not do that on purpose, period.  I don't think you did.  You don't got to sell me, though.  You got to sell a poor, hurt boy whose hero gave out his fucking phone number to a bunch  of fucking degenerates.  Well, it has begun.  Uh-oh, what? 
[02:56:00]  E-Rock has texted me.  No, no, he didn't.  What is it?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  And then another text that just says, asshole.  What the fuck?  He's pissed, man.  Of course he should be.  He's on vacation.  I can't even play this as a bit.  Of course he should be pissed.  Oh, no.  Opie, you should really think about how you can come clean with this.  Eric can make it up to him as well.  You got to buy him a new phone and pay for his phone bill for the first year. 
[02:56:30]  Jesus.  That's right.  It's crazy.  And only compliment his physique and his work ethic.  All those people that he knows, all the radio insiders and phone numbers, he's going  to have to fucking let all them know that he's got a new number.  I mean, the family's easy.  The family is easy.  But yeah, no, it's those people you rarely get in touch with.  Well, he'll have to keep this number.  I literally still get calls on my old phone.  He'll have to keep this number for a fucking year.  As he transfers over.  You owe him $1,500, Opie.  I'm not listening.  I'm writing him back. 
[02:57:00]  You have to give him $1,700.  Fine.  Fine.  Whatever.  Yeah, Liddy is.  That's another option.  She's got big hooters.  The Oapster doesn't do conflict these days.  So how much?  $1,700?  Fine.  You do it?  Yeah, right now.  You give him a check?  No problem.  Okay.  Then have you given him $1,700?  No problem.  He can't be pissed at you anymore.  He will have to keep this number for a while, though.  That's where the $1,700 comes in.  Yeah.  Just for that reason.  Because Opie's got to pay his phone bill for a year and a new phone.  That should be covered in $1,700.  Mm-hmm.  Jeez, that's a lot of money for a fuck-up. 
[02:57:30]  Dear Piggy.  Call in.  I swear I didn't do this on purpose.  I totally fucked up.  I was cold calling you to ask where we can finance mom singing Janis Joplin.  I know you're going to have a tough time believing this, but I just fucked up.  I really am sorry.  And tell him you owe him $1,700.  Oh, jeez.  Don't tell him that.  Well, we'll save that for later.  Yeah, I mean, you know, last-ditch effort.  I mean, you don't open with that.  I mean, come on.  See how he takes that news. 
[02:58:00]  And if he's very forgiving.  I called Eric on.  Eric has a work cell phone number, and I just called him, and I got through to him, actually.  And I said, hey, do you want to go on air because we're trying to fix the phone?  Of course he doesn't.  He's pissed.  He goes, no, tell him, fuck him.  I'm done.  I'm done with that.  And then he just hung up right on me.  But the bottom line is this.  He needs to come.  Hold on.  It's not even do you want to go on air.  There's an issue here.  And I know why he's angry.  I don't blame him.  He should be angry.  I'm not going to fucking play this differently.  I fucked up.  He has to come on the air. 
[02:58:30]  He should come on the air.  I'll call him back right now.  But we're not going to attack him.  No, hell no.  But he hung up immediately, so I'm going to try to call him right back.  Tell him he's got to come on the air, and it will make sense to him.  It was just a mistake.  There's always some big thing that happens when he's on vacation.  Every time.  This is like the worst, though.  We usually just annoy him a little with a phone call to his hotel room or something.  This one is just going to fuck with him for his whole vacation, the rest of the vacation.  He probably thought that it would never get worse than you calling him while he was on  his honeymoon.  I was speaking in Wail to E-Rock, yes. 
[02:59:00]  This is worse.  Probably thought that was the worst thing that would happen.  And then Opie inadvertently gives out his phone number.  Uh-oh.  You don't want to see that.  Oh, Sal's got something.  Eric told me to fuck off, and he said, fuck off, I'm done, and hung up again on me.  Wow, he's done.  Done with what?  The show?  What if he quit?  I can't keep him online any longer than that.  Nine years.  I can try calling again.  I was listening to Sal.  Sal clearly explained that we want to explain what happened.  We don't want to attack you.  We just want to talk to you and let you know what happened. 
[02:59:30]  And I heard Eric through the headset.  Oh, boy.  Yelling at Sal.  Oh, boy.  You are in Dutch now.  Well, we got to pay E-Rock or I got to pay E-Rock.  Is it time to pay E-Rock?  Eric.  Oh.  Yeah.  This pains me today.  This fucking pains me.  I hate being...  I remember how much you hated giving me, like, $100 because you lost some iPhone bet. 
[03:00:00]  I can't imagine this.  I don't like being...  Oh.  Like Fonzie.  You can't say wrong.  Right.  I was waiting for you.  I get it.  I can't be...  So most people know by now I fucked up really, really badly.  Still wish I would get just a little apology. 
[03:00:30]  Because you really thought I did it on purpose.  And you're lucky enough to hang out with me when I'm not doing radio.  Lucky...  Dr. Who's shirt?  Let me see it.  Kind of cool.  I like the British flag.  That is a cool one.  Thank you.  That's a good one.  How about a teeny apology?  No.  Why are you looking at me like a fucking bull ready to charge?  It was supposed to be a good day. 
[03:01:00]  Bull ready to charge.  It's been in so many ads I've seen.  So what happened for the people?  Because there are people that don't know, believe it or not.  You were on vacation enjoying yourself.  Yes.  And we wanted to play a bit we couldn't find.  So I called you.  And it went right to voicemail.  And then I wasn't paying attention.  And this is the God's honest truth.  And as I was trying to think of something witty to say on your phone, your number went out 
[03:01:30]  because you never put a message on your outgoing message thing.  Your fault.  Did you see the way he just explained that?  Shut up, Sam.  And well, then all hell broke loose.  And you almost quit, right?  I was really tempted.  I was so pissed off.  Right.  Because this happens every time.  Not that incident, but something happens every time I'm not here. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  So the Obster volunteered generously.  Yes.  I'm taking full responsibility.  Meaning I have to do something.  I can't just say I'm taking full responsibility.  So, you know, we went back and forth a little bit.  I sort of said I would pay for your vacation.  You did?  You said it, yeah.  But then you pumped up the numbers.  So then I decided to crunch my numbers.  They were pumped up.  There's receipts for everything. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, boy.  There's a $2,000 phone charge.  What is that?  Well, thanks to Sam and Roland's research, it turns out it would be about $2,000 to get the new phone.  Yeah, but you know what?  I said that maintaining, that would be the cost if you kept your old phone active, which you're not doing.  No, it's still active.  I just don't have a phone that's...  The old number's gone.  The old number's gone. 
[03:03:00]  So you have no purpose for a second phone.  Yes.  So that's out the window.  I could cut to the chase.  I knocked that right off the bill.  You didn't need a new phone.  Yes.  Yeah, you just changed the number.  So when the Opster was crunching numbers at home and thinking long and hard about this,  I decided to knock that right off the fucking bill.  All right.  So you knocked that off.  Yes.  Do we have a total from E-Rock before we...  What was the total?  We're not going to go to commercial.  That was all a dumb gag last week.  Go to commercial!  You talked about your vacation ad nauseam, but we were all scared of you that day, so 
[03:03:30]  we allowed you to talk, and you gave every single fucking detail of your vacation, and  then we left them hanging with the total, just when you were about to give the total.  What was the total?  The total was just over 9,600.  Whoa!  That's just shy of 10 Gs.  You were asking for 10 Gs for that stunt? 
[03:04:00]  A stack of high society.  It wasn't a stunt, you asshole.  Accidental stunt.  Yeah.  So, you know, but I saw the phone thing.  I'm like, okay, that's easy.  That's gone.  That's down to minus 2,000 from 9,600.  So you're getting $7,600.  Very nice.  Right.  Cool.  Good for you.  What?  7,600?  No.  7,600?  What?  7,000.  What happened?  Well, then I took a little taste.  You took a taste?  Of what?  For allowing him in my world. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, man.  A finder's fee?  So I took my taste.  Is that the privilege of getting to know you off the air that you were talking about?  Yes.  I see.  What was your taste?  I took another two Gs off it.  My taste.  Oh, I need the whole 9,600, Wade.  So then, you know.  You just got to talk about your finder's fee.  Right.  So I took a little taste.  Yeah.  So $5,600.  Well.  And then you got to round it.  I'm sure you rounded it.  Right up to 6,000.  Up to 6,000. 
[03:05:00]  No, I'm sure you rounded down.  Then I got to thinking.  I mean, it's not just about the money.  Uh-huh.  Mm-hmm.  I felt like it had to be done in a nice way.  Right.  So he did round up.  So I thought of what you really love.  Your penguin cocks?  One of the things you really love is your weight.  We all know that.  How much do you weigh?  You're stalling.  Keep going.  How much is it, though?  I'm guessing about 250 pounds. 
[03:05:30]  When I was crunching numbers.  Wait.  Wait.  These were some of the numbers you were crunching?  Yeah.  I was crunching numbers.  And I thought he's got to weigh about 250 pounds.  250?  No.  More or less, right?  Close enough?  On the moon.  No.  If I was you, I would admit to 250 right now.  Are you basing poundage per dollar amount or something like that?  No.  $250.  He really crunched some numbers.  I've been crunching and thinking it over. 
[03:06:00]  I wanted to make it special to show that I was very wrong that day.  Uh-huh.  And I also know you like, you love a good vending machine.  You do love chips.  Snacks is your thing.  You love snacks.  A salty snack in the afternoon.  And where does one get snacks?  A vending machine.  Also loves, like, video games.  Yes.  And you love video games.  Anthony, very good.  Yes, he does.  Didn't you go up to that place?  Fun spot.  Fun spot. 
[03:06:30]  Fun spot?  Yeah.  So I decided, Iraq, the make good is very simple.  I am paying you your weight in quarters.  There it is.  I am paying your weight in quarters.  There it is.  There you go.  I am paying your weight in quarters.  Yes.  Is that 250 pounds of quarters? 
[03:07:00]  Yes.  When I crunched the numbers, I figured it was about 250 pounds.  So I figured I would pay him.  Wow.  That is a fuckload of quarters.  There is 10 boxes of quarters at your feet right now, sir.  I want to be mad, but this is funny.  Oh, Iraq.  Each box weighs 25 pounds.  Can you put them up on the counter, Jim Norton?  God almighty.  These are fucking heavy. 
[03:07:30]  I have decided to pay your weight in quarters.  Let me see one of those.  Let me see one of those.  Jeez.  Oh, my God.  You can work out with this.  They're bricks.  They're 25-pound bricks.  That is a good one.  You can work out.  And if you do the math, that would be...  Maybe do some squats or something.  Yeah.  If you do the math, that would be $5,000 worth of quarters.  Wow.  For my fuck up.  Five Gs.  Five Gs.  Each box is 500 bucks. 
[03:08:00]  This is a $500 block?  500, yeah, bucks per box.  Are these wrapped?  Yep.  Are you sure?  If they're not, we're going to have a lot of fun in about two fucking minutes.  No, they're wrapped.  They're rolls.  Are they?  Here, put them all on the counter.  They weren't wrapped.  Oh, boy.  For the big photo op.  My fucking Twitter's going to explode.  Jesus Christ.  Don't break the fucking counter.  It's 250 pounds.  I don't know how the fuck you're going to get it out of here. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, does he have something to carry him home in?  Pocket change.  No.  You just fill your pockets with the change.  Yeah, just leave them in your desk for when you need a quarter for the wedding machine.  You're waiting quarters.  You're waiting quarters.  Yeah, I wouldn't put all of them up there, dude.  Do you think the console could collapse?  Yeah, I don't know if it would collapse.  If someone sits up there at 250 pounds, put them up there.  That's a lot of weight, dude.  Put them up.  Stack them up nice, like in a pyramid or something.  It's distributed.  Yeah, it'll be all right.  The weight's being distributed.  It'll be all right.  Oh, boy. 
[03:09:00]  So there you go, Iraq.  There's your make good.  Wow.  That's really nice.  That's pretty good.  I like it.  Iraq, that's going to be difficult to get home.  Get in front of it.  That's sad.  And there you have it.  I'm paying Iraq.  His weight in quarters. 
[03:09:30]  There's 10 boxes of quarters.  10 boxes of quarters.  That's $5,000 worth of quarters.  Sam.  Oh, my God.  Each box weighs 200.  If Sam drops it on his foot.  They're really heavy.  Yeah.  Yeah, each box weighs actually 25 pounds.  25 and a half.  25 and a half pounds.  So you're looking at 250 pounds worth of quarters for my fuck-up.  That's crazy.  There you go.  Enjoy.  Enjoy.  What do you have to say, Iraq?  I guess thank you. 
[03:10:00]  What do you mean, I guess thank you?  Damn right.  This is kind of a dick move.  What?  Kind of.  This is the big payback.  You're not appreciative, man.  I crunched the numbers.  I thought I would do something very nice for you.  Yeah.  And this was it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're waiting quarters.  I'm going to grab one box for me.  I'll take a box.  Hey, fucking Sam.  Goes to rip them off.  These are good to work out with. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  It's in quarters.  How am I going to get this out of here?  We'll help you.  We'll help you.  It'd be great if there was just one quarter on the top of each one where the holes are in  the box and the rest is just bricks or something.  He gets home like the old school scam, the old New York City scam.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what he's complaining about.  It's not like it's loose change.  Yeah, it's all wrapped up.  Nice.  It is.  Why don't you give him a documentary?  All right.  Beat it. 
[03:11:00]  Very good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  Let's get some asshole sniffing going.  Let's cut this place up into a mood of fun and festivity.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 continues right now.  Hit, hit, now, now.  Hello.  My name is E-Rock and it is the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:11:30]  Hope you've been enjoying it so far.  We're on day eight and we have two more days to go.  But for right now, we're going to look at our friend Mike Tyson.  2012.  We were surprised by a visit by Mike Tyson from our friend DJ Who Kid.  It's now 2013 and Mike has returned three more times this year.  You can get a whole collection of his appearances by subscribing to the Opie and Anthony show podcast on iTunes and then go download episode 28.  It has all the Mike Tyson stuff on there from the year 2013.  But until then, until you can get that, this is Mike Tyson's first appearance for the year 2013 on the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:12:00]  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Oh, I think I see Iron Mike Tyson.  That is Iron Mike Tyson and fucking Blubbery Roland.  Jesus.  Iron Mike and Marshmallow Roland.  What the fuck?  What?  He's not Iron Mike.  He takes it very seriously.  I know.  Iron Mike and Mushy Roland. 
[03:12:30]  Yes.  Iron Mike and Wrinkled Roland.  There he comes.  Look at that.  The champ.  Yeah.  That's always impressive when you see that.  He's like a rock, man.  He's just fucking like, look at his arms.  Like fucking eggplants to moms.  Holy fuck.  Fuck, yeah.  Holiday hams.  Iron Mike Tyson.  How you doing?  How you doing, Mike?  What's up, Mikey?  I'm living in this cruel world I'm living in. 
[03:13:00]  What?  Look at that hairdo.  Look at that.  You got black in you.  We've been saying it for years.  For years.  Don't try to hide, huh?  I thought you could hide that.  Mike, if he says he doesn't, put some in him.  No.  He's related to Thomas Jefferson.  Yeah.  For real.  And you know what Jefferson was doing.  Right?  With that lady named Sally Hemmon.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Sally.  That's that whole string of families that were.  Mustangs, Sally.  Mustangs, Sally.  They were ruining the reunions down there.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck the reunions. 
[03:13:30]  At first they said, hey, we're going to accept them.  They said, hey, we're not going to accept those niggers.  Fuck, no.  Because this guy couldn't keep his dick in his pants.  Fucking dumb fuck.  It was some nice cotillion, and then it turned into a cookout.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  It's okay.  But he's related, for real.  Are you from Virginia?  No, here.  New York.  Yeah.  No, but.  Listen.  Look at this.  He looked like a fucking founding father.  Yeah.  If you look at a picture of the squid on his forehead.  Yeah.  The founding father, dude.  Yeah, Sam definitely did.  We did a test on him.  We did a genetics test or whatever, and it said it was all east, but the whole thing's 
[03:14:00]  a lie.  I think he fixed it.  Yeah, I think it's bullshit.  There's a lot of bullshit in there.  Yeah, it's crap.  Mike, you wrote a hell of a book, man.  Well.  Holy shit.  600, 700 pages.  Hey, what's that shit with me on television?  What's that about?  Oh, shit.  That's a NASDAQ shit?  Yeah.  NASDAQ.  You're on the NASDAQ today.  I don't know what that was.  I always confuse NASDAQs with the racing shit.  What's that NASCAR?  NASCAR.  NASDAQ.  NASDAQ.  It's all the same.  How was the library last night?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, that was pretty cool. 
[03:14:30]  What did you do?  Was it a Q&A?  No, it was just me and the gentleman owned the library discussing things, issues, and  my life, my book, and history.  Nice.  They're still using that Dewey Decimal System over there?  Tell me about the hard catalog.  No, we're just talking shit.  Is that it?  It's some shit.  Who owns the library?  Is there a guy that actually owns the New York City Library?  It's still a library.  You know, whoever owns it.  Library guy.  One of the rich Jewish wasp guy.  A Jewish wasp guy.  Jewish wasp guy.  One of those rich.  Yeah.  The guy who loves himself and hates himself and loves himself and hates himself. 
[03:15:00]  Wow, yeah.  I'm about 250 pages in.  I didn't finish it yet.  And I've said it.  It's the best biography I've ever read.  Cold-blooded.  It's completely honest.  Completely honest.  Yeah, you let it out.  You let it out, Mike.  Scary stuff.  Scary stuff.  Damn, right?  It's an amazing life.  I hated it.  I didn't want to do this.  Like a year or so ago, Ratsul came to me and then he asked me something about my marriage.  And I said, hey, hey, fuck this.  This is too heavy, dude.  Oh, shit.  I'll see you later.  Come back tomorrow.  And I haven't seen him for like a year and a half. 
[03:15:30]  What happened with, you know, we get to ask you two at the press conference.  It was really, you were talking about Teddy Atlas, your old trainer.  And then you just, you know, we get on these verbal things.  We're just talking for a second.  All of a sudden, you were at this place where you're about, you realize you're confessing  that you had been using this whole time.  And like, what happened in that moment where you just?  Well, I don't know.  You know, I'm a recuperative addict and that's just what happens.  I go from one tantrum to another with the intensity of a second. 
[03:16:00]  And I said, fuck, hey, I'm really not being honest.  I'm really being a schmuck and I've been getting high for six days and drinking and stuff.  So, because people are starting to invest in me and stuff.  And I want you guys to know what you're getting now.  And so I don't want to be lying again because, you know, my whole life was a lie pretty much.  So I just want to tell you, this is what's happening.  So if you want to take your goodies away, just take them away.  I'm always trying to destroy myself some kind of way.  But shit, I'm just happy. 
[03:16:30]  You know, it kills me more to have that lie more so than this, you know, to have a lot of material things.  I just don't want to be in a feeling that you piece of shit.  Because I'm the first one to say, you're just a piece of shit.  You're still lying.  And my inner demons tell me, you got these white people fooled, but you don't got me fooled.  You ain't shit.  But, yeah, yeah, it affects you personally.  Yeah, like, at some point, even if you're saying fuck everyone else, you know, you're lying to yourself.  It's a, yeah, it's a tough one. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, personal demons, them things bother you.  Yeah, personal demons.  They need to shut the fuck up.  They don't need to do.  They don't stop.  They don't stop.  Oh, I know.  They don't stop.  Yeah.  They say, you're just a phony.  It's one of the people that love you and like you.  Oh, man.  And nobody's love can fix it.  That's the thing.  People take it personally who are close to us.  Like, how come you, you know, I've given you everything and it doesn't, I love you and I can lie to your face.  You know, for me, with sex more, I can just lie and mean it.  And it doesn't mean anything. 
[03:17:30]  Mm.  Oh, man.  Sex does that to you.  Too much of it does that to you.  You just want that feeling.  You want to have any cause.  I love you.  Take my money.  Take my money.  You fucking bitch.  Get away from me.  But at that moment, you know, you take everything.  You want to keep it in my car.  Take my deed.  Ah, fuck you.  Bitch, you're disgusting.  Get out of here.  You pick her up, try shaking it out.  Shit.  Yeah.  It does feel good to come inside, though.  It's really hard not to.  That's a really difficult one. 
[03:18:00]  There's something about that, especially knowing she's not on the pill.  There's a risk in that.  Jesus.  Because it's a form of destroying yourself.  Because you might get a prostitute pregnant.  Otherwise, you might get a venereal disease.  Oh, man.  And a baby come out with three heads.  Oh, fuck.  And a homophrodite.  You know?  It's just, what the fuck?  That's cool.  Yeah.  Because you feel that you're a piece of shit.  Because that's what you feel like.  You feel like you're not worth anything.  Even because you have all the money in the world.  You don't deserve this.  You're not worth anything.  So, you screw people who you think it's disgusting.  Because you feel this is what you're worth. 
[03:18:30]  Do you know how much a prostitute would feel like they won the lottery if they got pregnant  off of, you know, a Mike Tyson or something?  Yeah.  That would be like, oh, my God.  I hit the lottery.  I'm sure that happened before.  I'm sure that happened before.  I think girls were trying to get pregnant when they were with you, Mike.  Hey, man.  That's the easy road.  Yeah.  Maybe so.  For some people, right?  Yeah.  That's when you come in low with some body blows.  Right.  Jeez. 
[03:19:00]  Hey, that's just what it is, man.  Were you careful out there?  Because you knew you were aware of that one.  Never.  Never.  Never careful.  Nothing turned me on more than to have sex with strangers.  Yeah.  Somebody I met five minutes ago with a big cold sore on their lip and nose covered.  You know what I mean?  I see that come from the nose to the lip.  It's running.  The door is just extending.  Oh, my God.  Extending it almost to the chin.  I was like, wow.  Holy shit.  Man, it's fucking leaking a little.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just want to suck up all those fluids. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, my God.  That's an animal.  Holy shit.  That's hilarious.  I love this fucking show.  I could do this.  Of course.  I could do this in this show.  Did you ever tell?  I found myself telling girls, like hookers or dirty girls, that I loved them and I cared  about them.  No, no.  You got to listen.  I said, listen, bitch.  During this process, I'm going to tell you that I might love you.  Don't take it personal.  I just love to hear the fact.  I love the act of love.  I'm going to say I love you a couple of times.  So don't be thinking I really love you.  Damn.  Okay.  So you say, all right.  You ready?  Okay.  Oh, baby.  I just really love you.  Oh, baby. 
[03:20:00]  Please.  Oh, God.  You make all love being with you.  Oh, man.  Let me.  Oh, God.  I'm going to fuck you in the ass now.  That is showing love right there.  Love without a condom, please.  Imagine this is some shit.  I think the protocol, how much can I bet to pay you and fuck you out of a condom?  Wow.  It's some really dark.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the most stuff.  There's a price for everything, though.  I was in a Brazilian whorehouse and I was fucking a girl. 
[03:20:30]  That's awesome.  Oh, they're the best.  I tell you that.  No, because they look awesome.  You never see people like this.  God, why don't people like this have morals?  People with bodies like this don't have fucking morals.  Why can't I find somebody like this with morals with this body?  Fuck.  That kid, I want to go to school.  That got more than a fucking kindergarten education and their mother.  You know?  Fuck, man.  Now, it's truthful, right?  You know, most of the girls you see you like and they have beautiful bodies.  They're really fucking dirt poor.  You know what I mean?  You wind up, oh, it's really bad stuff. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, man.  I didn't like that you couldn't communicate in English, though.  I like, there's something about the dirty talk or the communication that I like to have back and forth.  When they didn't speak English, it made it a little harder for me to enjoy it.  No, no.  Because sex was just an international language, you know?  Hey, yeah, no.  Right, right, right.  No, no, no, no.  I guess that's no.  No, no, no, no.  No.  Yeah, that sounds like no.  There was a Brazilian, she was a hooker and I was fucking without a rubber in the whorehouse.  I love you so much. 
[03:21:30]  He's so self-destructive.  Yeah.  You know, he's a beautiful, listen, listen.  This guy's a beautiful guy.  I know him.  Besides this, I don't know him this way, but I know he's a beautiful guy, very generous,  but would just destroy himself for that quick moment of gratis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  Yeah.  You have to have it.  There's no logic to it.  You have to have it.  He's a highly, highly successful rate type of guy, but a highly self-destructive kind of guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I'm the same way.  We live by rushes, right? 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  The rush.  And then after it's over, fuck, I got AIDS.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  What happened?  The demons.  Those personal demons.  Okay, I got AIDS.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Jesus.  Got AIDS.  You have children?  No kids.  No.  Oh, fuck.  Once you have children, you got to think, oh, now that's another fucking, oh, that's another  torture trip on you.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  You're irresponsible now.  I can't fuck the neighbor's wife because my kids are going to have a bad, you know,  they're going to go to school, fuck, they're going to wind up seeing a psychiatrist  and shit. 
[03:22:30]  That's his responsibility.  Oh, fuck.  It's a little different.  Kids, I can't fuck the neighbor's wife.  Oh, God.  The kids are going to go to school together and the other kids are going to kick my kid's  ass because I got his mother's pregnant and I'm fuck.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It scares me to have kids for that reason.  It's like, you know, that you now have something they can hold over you, but I have no responsibility  to do it.  Oh, man.  Listen, but life is about responsibilities.  You never know who you truly are unless you have those responsibilities and you're back  against the wall.  Of course, no one cares about themselves. 
[03:23:00]  No one cares about themselves, really.  You know, if I die, I die.  Fuck it.  At least I live my life.  But now you can't say, fuck, I can't even die because I got these little motherfuckers.  You got kids.  You can't even die with dignity because I got these guys.  I got to make sure they get a good education and stuff.  Yeah.  Now you're, yeah, yeah.  I got to wipe their ass.  I got to go to the store.  I got to go to Vons.  I find myself going to Vons buying egg whites and stuff like that and sausages for the kids  before they go to school.  Oh, shit.  You know, in some way, you lose a form of dignity. 
[03:23:30]  Hell, I'm no longer the baddest man on the planet.  I'm going to school shopping for these little snotty-nosed fuckers that don't appreciate  me.  Let's get another Tyson has to deal with all that.  Oh, shit.  God damn, man.  Can I say the turn on, too?  And by the way, in fucking this girl without a condom, I did it twice.  Two days in a row.  I saw it.  She kept, we were fucking, she kept going, you're special.  Yeah, you want people to love you, but you want them to love you with your terms.  You want them to love you, but you want them to love you and say, fuck it, I'll take that 
[03:24:00]  bullet for you.  It's good, because now that you're dead, I don't got to deal with that responsibility  of you loving me no more.  Now I'll find someone else.  You know?  Imagine how the pharaoh felt.  You know, I don't got to respond to nobody.  If you die, fuck you or I fuck someone else.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or you're spew with someone else.  Not much responsibility.  Yeah.  Imagine if you had, listen, imagine if you had a girlfriend or somebody that was tight with  you, you were married to you, and they'd say, fuck it, yes, no, no, no, no, no.  You can't really go out.  And if you go out, you got to say, fuck, she might kill herself, fuck. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, shit.  Or she might burn my fucking clothes up.  Or burn my house down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck, you can't leave her alone, so you're with her all the time.  That's the reason that you stay with all the time.  God damn, that's terrible.  She might burn the fucking house down.  Or she might have figured out my email password, so I got to fucking make sure I'm by the computer  so she can't go on it.  Listen, you always have to hide other girls, and you got to find a way to do it, and you  got to tell your friend when you're with your wife, get that number for me.  Oh, shit.  You know, always have a chapbook, get that bitch's number.  Or you put them under guys' names, or you put, like, if the girls' names are true.  Oh, they know that one. 
[03:25:00]  These fucking girls are good.  I know.  They wonder why I'm texting my cock to a guy, and I'm like, no, it's Frank, my friend.  Frank is measuring it.  He's telling me ways to make it longer.  He's telling me ways to make it bigger for you.  I'm doing it for you.  It's for your pleasure.  I'm going to hit that special spot.  I'm going to hit that spot.  It's Dr. Frank.  Yeah, fucking not where you put Frank and Julie.  You put the girl's name with the guy's name in front of it.  Julie is the fucking middle name.  He's Jewish.  His name is Jules, okay?  It's Jules.  Frankie Jules.  Did you lay off sex before fighting?  Because that's an old myth that you can't fuck before you fight. 
[03:25:30]  No, no, you guys.  Sometimes it's good.  Sometimes, you know, it depends on the person.  Yeah.  Sometimes it's a little intense.  Boom, you get that number.  Hey, I'm pretty loose.  I'm going to fuck him up.  Yeah, it was always the myth that it would take your legs out.  Right.  From under you.  Yeah, yeah.  It would take the energy.  Nice.  Yeah.  Obviously not.  Fighting is psychological.  Life is psychological.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just how you perceive it, I believe, you know?  There's a picture in the book of you at 13, which amazes me that you're only 13 there.  You look like a grown man.  Yeah, I would look like this at 13. 
[03:26:00]  Pretty much.  Jesus.  Everybody thought I was going to be tall, but I stopped growing.  Right.  And that's something, no.  I'm just a fucking...  I'd probably be 5'10, fellas.  10 and a half.  It's funny you mentioned the height, too.  There was one, you know, because the stuff with cuss, I think,  is some of the best stuff in the book.  It's like you touch on it in the store, in the one-man show,  but the book goes, there's so much you learn about that relationship and living there.  And at one point, he mentioned something about you.  He wished you were taller, and you said that really hurt you.  He wished I was bigger.  Oh, was that you were a bigger guy?  Like Ken Norton, Mike Weaver, who's just Hercules, Mike Weaver, who's just massively muscular guys. 
[03:26:30]  Right, right.  You know what I mean?  And I said, you watch.  He said, because they would be intimidated of your physique.  And I said, you watch, because one day the whole world's going to be afraid of me.  Yeah.  Because he was really, he had the science of intimidation and fear down to a, man, he had it down to a pack, man.  He just knew that stuff.  Because he was a very tiny man, but he was very ferocious.  He knew how to, that ferocious.  He just, even at 70, he just turned right away and said, go, what's he? 
[03:27:00]  He's right within a tenth of a second.  Were you scared of him?  Were you scared of him?  Hell yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Even though you know physically you could take him.  Yeah, no, that doesn't, psychologically it wouldn't.  He didn't have to do it.  He could just say something, oh, you're so bad.  Wow.  Me disappointing him.  Wow.  Him being disappointed and feeling let down by me would kill me.  Yeah, it's worse than a punch, right?  Yeah, my whole objective was to make him happy.  As long as he was around the house happy, talking about me.  Oh, man, Mike, you're the best.  My son is the best fighter in the world.  There's no one in the country, he's a national champion. 
[03:27:30]  When he was talking about me and proud about me, I felt on cloud nine.  Yeah.  When he was down, the whole house was down.  When he was happy, the whole house was happy.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  That's a good thing for a trainer to have, the ability to deflate you or get you to do something  just by being disappointed because you can't bully a fighter.  You know how people achieve in life?  Yes, you can, though.  But they achieve by having good mentors, by wanting to make their mentors happy.  And if you can make your good mentors happy, then you're happy. 
[03:28:00]  That's just so awesome.  I mean, that's what a good mentor is, is by pleasing that guy, finding someone that you  want to make happy.  Either you find that in good ways or bad ways.  If you can please that guy, you're successful.  Right, right.  Even if it's good or bad, you're very successful by pleasing your mentor and by looking up to  your mentor and trying to make him happy.  Speaking of that, how would your life be different if he lived, let's say, another five years?  Well, I would still, listen, when I'm 47, I'll be still fighting.  If Cus is still 11, I'll be still, he didn't believe in age, he believed in your spirit. 
[03:28:30]  He believed fighting was a spirit.  If you had the spirit to fight, you could continue to fight.  You say, look, you never took a beat and these guys are comatose.  They've been knocked out, colon, and they're still fighting, Mike.  You should still be fighting, Mike.  Mike, matter of fact, let me pick your fighters, Mike.  Okay, let me pick them for you.  Wow.  Let me pick the fights.  Let me pick the fights.  You could still be fighting.  Yeah, yeah.  So you have no doubt you would have fought a lot longer.  He inspired me.  Right.  I would want to fight.  It wasn't like he'd be pushing me.  I'd be like, okay, because yeah, yeah.  You know, he was the guy who knew how to press those buttons to make me believe I can conquer 
[03:29:00]  the world.  That whole intimidation factor thing, you wound up being an expert at that.  That's for sure.  When was she in that show?  Who was that?  Showgirl.  My mother, Elizabeth.  Oh, that was Elizabeth.  Tell me her name.  Berkeley?  Berkeley, yeah.  That was her?  That was her?  Yeah.  She's beautiful.  Yeah, she was in that movie where she was a stripper.  So cool.  With the other awesome chick, too.  What was her name?  Come on.  Gershon.  Gina.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Gina.  Definitely.  Yeah, you would come out, and obviously, before you even got in the ring, the other fighter 
[03:29:30]  was intimidated.  You got your money's worth.  They were intimidated.  That's what he just cuts the thing.  More so being grateful.  He said, intimidate.  The major factor of intimidation was basically, you know what I mean, pulverizing the guy.  Yeah, but the fact that you started off with just being a very ominous person.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I wasn't smart enough to take it out of my personal life.  You know, if I was that guy, well, the fights are over real quick, so I'm still pretty pumped,  so I want to fight somebody outside, too. 
[03:30:00]  I wish I wasn't in that way and stuff.  But people had no clue about the real Mike Tyson.  They didn't know you, your sense of humor.  They didn't know what you liked to do in your personal life that wasn't self-destructive.  Like, they, I remember watching fights and just going, oh my God, here's this guy that  goes out and beats the fucking shit out of people, and that's all anyone knew of you.  Was that frustrating at all?  Did you want people to know more about you?  That stage in my life, I wanted everybody to be afraid of me. 
[03:30:30]  You wanted just fear, right?  Yes, I think I was a monster.  Wow.  Yeah, because you're hilarious, and we just never saw that when you were fighting.  You were always so intense.  No, the other fighters were never laughing in the ring.  Oh, God, no.  Well, you know, that's the 50 Cent was telling me that, right?  He was saying, listen, Mike, you know, because I started acting, somebody said, see,  you know what I mean?  They always saw you with your war face on there.  They saw you like this.  You know, it was going to be tough.  You had to change it around.  But he was always telling me that.  And I never thought about that.  He had to tell me that.  And I said, listen, the reason why people are a little hesitant and apprehensive is because  they never saw you like this. 
[03:31:00]  They always saw you with your war face on.  I was surprised, too, how much you, like, you talk a lot about crying and being emotional  and, like, all these things that would go back and you would cry about.  And it was like, you seem to have always been that guy, but just hid it really well.  Like, a guy who was affected and sensitive to things, but just nobody had any idea about that.  Well, you know, Cuts didn't like that stuff that was sensitive.  He thought a fighter should have no emotion.  Old school thought on that, yeah.  I never saw him cry, never saw him show emotions like that until he was dying.  Because the only reason he was mad was because he wanted to marry his life-love, Camille Ewald. 
[03:31:30]  And he was mad he couldn't marry her because he had tax problems.  Oh, shit.  And he was just, back then, if you marry somebody, you take their problems on and all that crap.  Oh, right.  Almost like, you know, almost like the pharaohs.  If you die, you still, the pharaoh dies, you got to go in the tomb with him.  You got to go with him.  Oh, is that what happened?  Oh, to help him?  If you're hanging out in a marketplace shopping, the pharaoh died.  Oh, no.  Now, you got to go being bombed in there with his slaves, with his eunuch slaves, right? 
[03:32:00]  What's that word?  The eunuch slaves?  Yeah, yeah.  You got to go in there with those guys and, you know, nothing's happening.  You're in the mood.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Wow.  What a bitch.  Dude, that sucks.  The part, I actually was on a plane reading about Cuss being in the hospital, and I cried.  I was really, really sad.  And there's nothing worse than crying on a plane because it's fucking humiliating.  Because you can't go anywhere, and you got to put your sunglasses on, and it just balls  up behind your eyes.  Oh, did you?  You just close your eyes behind sunglasses, and then if you move, it's just going to go  down to your fat face.  Why don't you wipe your eyes? 
[03:32:30]  Because you can't hide a good cry.  No, because people look at you, and they see you reading, and then you're just dabbing  your eyes like fucking someone's grandmother.  It was truly embarrassing.  Wow.  But that was really fucking...  That was deep.  It was great.  Yeah, it was really, really good.  Man.  No question.  We were just saying it was great.  Thank you.  Yeah.  The male stewardess was laughing at you.  Yeah.  I mean, I tend to react to, you know...  How were you in school?  What was going on with you in school?  I was just...  I was the funny guy.  I did not get a lot of girls, and I didn't wash my hair a lot. 
[03:33:00]  I had a lot of dandruff.  I was a very dirty young man.  Dandruff?  Whackin' and Jack.  Non-stop.  I went to school across the street.  Whackin' Jack.  Whackin' Jack.  I'd walk home on lunch, jerk off, and then feel tremendous guilt and walk back like the  whole school knew I had just jerked off.  They probably did.  Yeah, they probably did.  It was probably still all of my funny clothes.  They didn't know anybody that took fuck.  He's got to be jerking off.  Yeah, walk back with your dick still hanging out.  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy.  I was a terrible student.  No, it was a trick dropped out. 
[03:33:30]  He dropped out of high school.  Yeah, I was, you know, the old...  You can't do it sometimes.  I just didn't have the time or energy.  I wasn't interested in what they were teaching, you know?  Nothing.  Garbage.  I had no interest in it.  If they were teaching and broadcasting on the radio, maybe you would have liked that  stuff.  Maybe I would have.  Yeah, stuff like that.  I liked science and stuff, but I liked just hanging out and learning the shit.  I didn't like the tests and the fucking structure of it.  I had the cheat sheet and still failed.  I had the cheat sheet and still failed.  Still failed.  Yeah, yeah.  I wanted to learn shit just because I wanted to learn it. 
[03:34:00]  I didn't want to be tested on it.  I didn't want to pass or fail.  That's stupid.  You know, and the structure of school is what fucked me up.  And, you know, pot.  I smoked a lot of pot in high school and, you know, you have all good intentions.  And then after a couple of joints, you really just want to lay down and watch cartoons.  Not do too many joints.  It's like one couple of hits and then, now you're ready.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm ready.  Well, that wasn't happening.  I smoked a lot of weed back in high school. 
[03:34:30]  Who is we as human beings?  Some things that we can conceive in our minds and some things that we can't.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that the process of us coming from animals to human beings and some things take longer  for us to learn than some animals?  Like some dogs learn faster than other dogs and stuff.  Yeah, I think we're pretty similar to that whole thing.  I think there's some instincts in there that some people are better at than others.  Yeah, yeah.  And learning, you know, common sense, things like that. 
[03:35:00]  We're the same as dogs, though.  When you look at it like as an addict, like a dog comes, like whenever you walk in the  door, the fucking dog runs over because he knows the treat giver is there.  Is here.  I mean, that's the same way we are.  It's like if I get hooked on something, it's like I go to the same place, the same thing,  ritual every time I have to.  I used to get hookers.  I would ride around.  They had to get in my car, the fucking right side of my car.  They had to approach the right side, my passenger window, or I wouldn't talk to them.  What the hell is that about?  It's just ritualistic fucking things.  Why not the left side, though?  I don't know.  You never figured that out.  I like it to feel seductive.  Were you worried they were going to do something to you? 
[03:35:30]  It's like with drugs as well.  You don't feel good.  You're miserable until you get the drug.  You're high without even using them because you know you're going to get high.  Oh, you know you're going to get high.  Yeah, so you're really high and stuff.  And then a guy called for it.  I just got pulled over.  The possibility, they found the fucking dope.  Oh.  And then you fucking, you come down and you're like, fuck yourself.  This guy fucked my whole buzz up.  Yeah.  Well, even when you're high, the rest of the night is dedicated to trying to feel as good  as you did when you first got high that evening.  You're chasing them high.  And you never fucking get it. 
[03:36:00]  You never get it.  Next thing you know, you wake up with some weird people.  Whoa.  That's weird.  Shit.  Did you touch me?  Did I touch you?  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  It's awesome.  Rules.  God.  God.  God.  Yep.  Yep.  You grew up in a pretty, I always read the childhood stuff.  Usually childhood stuff in a biography, you're like, all right, but this was, fuck it.  I could not get enough of the childhood stuff.  Holding a gun at like what?  Like eight, nine years old?  You were carrying, you had a pistol.  Jesus.  Yeah.  A little cheap ass 38. 
[03:36:30]  At eight, nine years old.  Yeah.  It's a different.  I can't even imagine that.  It's just what you do.  It's just what you do.  They're the people, the older people in your life.  That's what they do.  That's the end of this.  You're watching them do things in the street.  You're watching them snatch things.  And you, and these are people who are nice.  This is uncle such and such.  They're aren't.  Oh, so it's.  And they're good people to you, but to some other parts of the world.  Uh-huh.  Not so good.  Wow.  And your mother and her boyfriend, there was really good stuff about, uh, you saw her  throw boiling water on them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She scrawled them with boiling water. 
[03:37:00]  Wow.  Wow.  And what did you say?  Like he went to the liquor store for her or something.  And then you're like, that's explained my dysfunction with women.  No.  Um, after she did this stuff and they would have fights, he would go and buy her liquor and  cigarettes, like reward her for doing fucked up shit.  Wow.  What the hell is that about?  Cause he may say, well, I've did bad things to her too.  So this is, you know.  Make up for it.  This is crazy.  I have to, but this is how I live my life too.  A little dysfunctional.  Yeah.  A little bit.  You know, you, you, you would think this is your worst enemy, but I loved him. 
[03:37:30]  Please don't leave me.  Don't leave me.  I know I punch you in the face, baby.  Don't leave me.  Take my money.  Take my wallet.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't go.  Wow.  That, yeah, yeah.  You're comfortable in that fucking unhappiness.  Right, right, right.  And then when things are going well, you say, this is not normal.  This is sick.  You start getting uncomfortable when it's too normal.  This is really sick.  My kids are in a great school.  Right.  Their mother's doing well. 
[03:38:00]  We have maids.  We have servants and stuff, but this is not cool.  I gotta screw the maid.  I gotta do something else.  I gotta screw the maid.  I gotta screw the maid's daughter or something.  You gotta fuck things up.  Oh, man.  This is just too good.  Maybe I'll get up pregnant and we'll have a real big Brady bunch.  Arnold Schwarzenegger wound up doing that.  Fuck the maid and look what happened.  You know, I don't know.  Made a little Arnold.  Yeah, that's, wow.  Did you look, though, was there any sense of that isn't right?  As a kid, you're seeing all this fucked up shit going around. 
[03:38:30]  And I understand it's like, well, that's the way things are.  But was there anything in your head that made you think, wow, there's something wrong here?  Well, not really.  Because if you think about it, you know, the biggest stars in the world, old grown men, people who you think were supposed to be respected, they've done it before you.  Maybe older guys who were successful and they were saying, hey, this is how you treat a woman.  This is what you do.  Don't let her take the other hand.  And this is just what it's always been.  It's always been a male misogynist kind of world, especially America.  You know, it's always been that kind of male orientated, you know, don't let that bitch play you. 
[03:39:00]  You're the man of the house.  It's from your rib.  God made up from your rib, nigga.  Shit.  I read that in the Bible.  Right.  Just like that.  Just like that.  Yeah, exactly.  They're pimping in the Bible.  You know what I mean?  Because that's when you see, normally you see preachers and stuff, it's like preachers slash pimps because they dress the same, drive the same car, look the weight.  That's funny.  Yeah, they do.  Greasy hair, they're looking good.  You think about it.  Yeah.  Pimping up there in the church. 
[03:39:30]  Most pimps know the Bible real well.  Yeah.  But you escaped all that and made something of yourself.  No, maybe.  I don't know.  Did I escape it?  I think so.  Did I escape it?  For the most part, yeah.  Maybe physically.  Physically, I escaped.  My parents escaped that.  Yeah.  You know, I'm not in the same vernacular.  I'm not in the same neighborhood.  Right.  I still have the same characteristics.  Well, you used to go back to the neighborhood when you started making it, too.  Absolutely.  You were just addicted to going back to that world?  Or have you ever tried to figure that one out? 
[03:40:00]  No.  It's my insecurities.  You know, I just want them to know they're never tougher than me.  Yeah.  Even though I have this, I still stomp you down.  I just always had that mentality.  I never wanted to be bullied again.  I never wanted to think because I'm not in this environment.  You could just say, oh, he's soft now.  I never wanted to have that appearance that he's soft now.  He can't come to Brownsville no more.  Uh-huh.  And I always wanted to know that I'm always here.  And there's always a possibility that I'll do something real bad to you.  Wow.  Wow.  Damn.  It seems...  I was going to say, there's also something about going back home. 
[03:40:30]  You're coming from a place...  There's always something to fucking prove.  I don't care if it's a white neighbor or a ugly.  There's always something you have to prove.  You're leaving there with these dreams and hopes that you're going to do something.  And you think they want you to do it.  They want you to fail.  Right, right.  Because you know, I don't care what neighborhood, what nationality.  Yep.  They come out, oh, you thought you were going to make it.  Now you're back.  You're back with us.  Yeah.  Fucking piece of shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So when you go back, it's almost like, yeah, fuck you.  Look what I did. 
[03:41:00]  But it doesn't help.  It doesn't...  No, it doesn't.  No one cares.  It's only within your own head that existence exists.  But you don't have to physically travel back home to resolve that in your own head.  You know?  You never know.  For some people, they do.  Yeah.  But were you going back there when you were really famous?  Yeah.  Wow.  With my Rolls Royce, no bodyguards.  Wow.  Yeah.  You know, and I'm one of the guys.  And you always...  In our neighborhood, it's always the doggy dog.  You always have to... 
[03:41:30]  And that's crazy when I think about...  That's why you always have to have that feeling or that aura that I will still do something  very bad to you.  Right, right.  You always have to have that.  It's amazing to me how many times you almost blew it.  Like when I'm reading the book, there's a lot of times you went back and these things  that you almost did when you were starting to get really famous about you were going to  rob houses and that your friend, he saved you.  And it's like no matter how well you're doing, there's that part that almost wanted to self-destruct.  But there's always, you know, in every neighborhood, there's always somebody that probably had played sports 
[03:42:00]  and you never knew he played sports or he almost had it or he did something and he lost it.  And he said, hey, listen, man, don't do this.  And he said, you know, Mike, I used to play.  I used to box.  You know, I didn't have it, but I almost made it, man.  But I got caught up with drugs.  I got caught up with this case or something, man.  And they said, go back to those white people, man.  They love you.  Trust me.  Go back to those white people.  I wish I had some white people that love me.  God damn.  That's just what they're saying.  That's pretty much what it is.  Right, right.  That's what it is.  Damn. 
[03:42:30]  That's unbelievable.  It makes you wonder how many people almost made it out and went back one too many times and didn't.  Oh, right.  Oh, absolutely.  Somebody may have killed them.  I was remembering the gentleman, Len Byers, he went back to celebrate and died of a drug overdose.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know?  Remember that one.  Demons always follow us.  I don't care who you are, how successful you are.  That's why they're demons.  They don't go anywhere.  They never leave.  Even if you have them under control, they're still there.  They're still there, right over your shoulder.  Demons don't go anywhere.  Whoever said they killed their demons are lying.  They never leave. 
[03:43:00]  They never leave.  A constant battle.  God damn, man.  I'm amazed at the bullying too.  There's a lot of stuff about being bullied as a kid.  It was real bullying and horrible bullying and the things that they would call you.  And it's hard to picture you going through that as a person.  You know, when I was younger, you know, I always hung out with my sister and her friends.  My brother's five years older.  And I was overweight. 
[03:43:30]  You know, like I said, I was chubbier than if I would look like this.  You know, little kid.  And these people were just always going to be fair.  They would kick my ass and talk crazy to me.  I never fought before.  You know what I mean?  But something that was just so weird, you know, that it's really strange.  I was just good at fighting.  So no one had to teach me.  Boom.  Oh, so when you finally, when you had to fight, you were good at it.  Even though I didn't know the punch I was throwing, I grabbed him, I grabbed him, I just came on naturally.  Don't mess with this fucking kid anymore. 
[03:44:00]  That's why I realized some things do come, fighting do come naturally.  We're born to fight.  We're born to be killers.  You know, we just, some people transform into something else they don't want to do.  But we're born to do this stuff, I believe.  To defend ourselves.  There was the one story you told.  It was one of the worst ones where they, what is that bullshit?  What does it say right there?  This is a strange title.  Mike Tyson, former boxing champion.  You're doing the closing bell today.  Oh, fuck, nigga.  Nigga. 
[03:44:30]  Please say that there.  Please yell that.  Oh, nigga.  I'm a bad nigga.  Yeah, they get the big celebrities to do the closing bell.  You're doing it today.  You know, it'd be really funny.  I used to know, listen, I was just number one of the end celebrities.  I was always like the black celebrity.  The black celebrity said, no, we're going to stay away from the country.  You know, white people won't like us if we're with Mike.  You know, let's stay away.  Right when the bell rings, just turn around and clock the head of NASDAQ right in the head. 
[03:45:00]  You fucker!  Like if it gets the fucking bell.  Ding, ding.  Bam!  Oh, that'd be a great news story for the night.  Oh, that would be some beautiful shit.  You know, I'd probably have no bell when I get in jail.  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, that'd be a rough one.  Mike's promoting, by the way, Undisputed Truth.  The Undisputed Truth.  His book is out.  I'm about 350 pages into it.  It's absolutely amazing.  Right now, how old are you now?  I'm 45.  45, huh?  So you're dealing with that middle-aged crisis, so you're trying to fuck it out of you, right?  You get that middle-aged crisis, you just want to stroke. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  You just want to stroke.  Them strokes are going to get that pain.  Oh, I'm too old.  I'm not even fucking it out of me.  I'm just tugging it out of myself.  I wish I had the dignity of fucking it.  I'm just pulling it out of my own dick and then closing the text message.  It really is a detached, awful cyber existence.  Closing the text.  Yeah, there's no real interaction with anybody.  Listen, check this out.  Have you found anybody that just knocked you off your feet?  Yeah, I found a few.  I found a few over the years.  Oh, no, no, there's always going to be that one that just say, hey, this is crazy. 
[03:46:00]  This is where a really pickish, chauvinistic instinct comes in.  Hey, I don't want no one else to do what I'm doing to her.  You just come over here and hang out here for a while.  It's not so much that I don't want to do this to anyone else.  You don't want her doing it to anyone else.  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  But listen, that's just what happens to people who have been single for a long time  until we find out something that's not good with these people 
[03:46:30]  and we can throw them back into the little fish shell there.  But other than that, man, we should hold on to them and see what happens.  A little magic might work there.  I think this guy, he don't want to believe in this stuff,  but I think he'd be an awesome, responsible guy  because he's an extremist and shit with all that stuff.  I believe if he focused that on just really caring about an entity and stuff,  he'd be a monster.  Oh, Jimmy is really a solo kind of guy.  Mike thinks about sex a lot.  Yeah, a lot.  He wants to believe that because he doesn't believe that he'll do well in it. 
[03:47:00]  You know, he's scared to go through and make the mistakes  and far the relationship are concerned.  You know, he's scared of the mistakes because we're all going to make mistakes.  I love psychoanalyzing Jimmy with Mike Tyson.  This is great.  Yeah, but he's right.  I mean, you know, I'm very bad at that stuff.  Because you've chosen a career path that is very solo, stand-up comedy.  I think you're very caring and stuff, but you don't want kids  because you don't like changing anything that you think might be detrimental  to your career or self. 
[03:47:30]  Or sexual addiction.  And it's also unselfish.  So you don't want to put somebody else through that.  I know how I am and I don't want to be a pig.  But there's people that want to be a part of that with you.  You just go through that with you.  Ain't that some bullshit?  Yeah.  You want to go through this painful life.  Yeah, right.  Who wants to do that?  Stable life.  You want to endure this shit?  But maybe that stable life is not cool for them.  They want to help somebody.  They want to help you, Jimmy.  They want to save you.  I've had girls tell me their problems and really very emotional stuff.  And I've caught myself darting my eyes off to the television. 
[03:48:00]  That just proves right there.  I have no fucking compassion.  I'm like the hump, bitch.  Just keep your problems to yourself, okay?  Don't tell me your problems, okay?  Because I got my own.  If your problems intertwine with mine, I might kill you, okay?  Mike, how do you get girls in prison?  That amazes me.  Oh, man.  Well, um...  How did that all come about?  Okay, um...  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[03:48:30]  Well...  People, um...  Believe it or not, I was Mike Tyson.  And people, um...  People kind of, like, wrote me pen pal letters when I was in jail, you know.  And you just get a lot of people to look the other way.  And, um...  They said, no, no one always looked.  I always got in trouble because I touched and kissed too much and stuff.  Right.  But it was a guy in prison.  There's always some fucking white guy in these prisons.  He's got the system down, packed.  Even though he's always in fucking prison and never gets...  He always gets caught.  But he got the system packed down.  He said, this is what you do. 
[03:49:00]  You have them come, you know, to some address that they wear.  To some address they hear.  And the button's in the front, right?  You remember the button's, of course, in the front.  Have them wear it backwards.  No underwear or less.  Sometimes they'll check for underwear.  And you got to come to prison with underwear.  Make the underwear crotchless.  They never check the fucking crotchless underwear.  Oh, shit.  Oh, these fucking guys.  These fucking...  Wow.  That's why your white guys run the country.  Because your motherfuckers think of this shit.  Right.  So, um...  He, um...  Decreptive.  And then...  No, I'm serious, right?  Who would think?  Who would think of white motherfuckers think of this shit, right?  And, um...  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[03:49:30]  No, but really, right?  And I'm like, you're listening, man.  Are you listening, Mike?  All right, listen.  All right?  Fuck.  All right, listen.  Damn.  I'm going to get in trouble for this, all right?  So, um...  Man, how I know...  I got three of my wife's pregnant.  I got three fucking kids since I've been in prison.  Okay?  So, listen.  Oh, man.  So, he goes like this.  He said, you have them turn around.  And you have them...  The best...  You have them unbuttoned the top.  And they come for that quick couple of seconds.  They can give you a kiss and sit on your lap.  And you have them come in and kiss.  And you're sitting here.  Put him right on in here.  Shook, shook, shook.  And you've got to come real quick.  Because you haven't had sex in a long time.  Unless you've been jerking off.  You've been jerking off, Mike.  Don't do that.  But I'm like, you're going to come real quick. 
[03:50:00]  Hit.  And then that's it, Mike.  Then you sit down.  And you continue the conversation.  Else you actually dismiss.  One or the other.  But if I were you, I'd take advantage of the hour and have a conversation.  You might get hard again and try that again.  So basically, that's how I did it.  And then again.  I can't believe I'm talking about this shit.  Anyway.  So compelling.  Jesus.  It's amazing.  I'm amazed.  Mike is the perv.  Perv.  Perv you perv.  Okay.  So just had a girlfriend.  I had a little counselor there and stuff.  Oh, wow. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  My drug counselor.  So I said, she kept saying, I can help your time.  Cut some of your time off if you take my test.  I said, I don't need your damn test and stuff.  And then there's a possibility I could get some.  Hey, yes.  I think I did have a lot of drinking problems.  And I dealt with drugs in the past.  And maybe me and you could work something out and I can get help.  Because I tried to take the GET test.  And that would take some time.  But I fucking failed the test.  Okay.  I said, fuck.  God damn.  I can't even pass a fucking GET test.  Fuck. 
[03:51:00]  What happened?  So the counselor.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Offered money and stuff.  Oh, man.  I'm always paying.  You know, I'm always a quick guy to pay.  My mother accepts money.  Most of the women I know accept money.  And if you didn't accept money, I didn't like you.  So you're something wrong with you.  You got morals?  Uh-uh.  You don't got morals.  You got a venereal disease.  I don't want to be with you.  Everything.  Obviously, you went through a point in your life where you believed everything was for sale.  Everything. 
[03:51:30]  Everything is for sale.  But every price is the money.  Everything is for sale.  Okay.  All right.  Sometimes money isn't the price.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Sometimes you have to love somebody.  Sometimes you have to, you know, it's just all not for sale by money.  Everybody has a price, but it's not money.  Wow.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  That is a fucked up little story.  And it's a very-  Drug counselor is supposed to fucking be there to, you know, help you out in another way.  She was.  She was.  She was.  Of course.  She was helping him out.  I'm sure she helped him out in that way.  Let me judge you, motherfucker. 
[03:52:00]  Fucking judgmental-ass fucking white people.  And you're the one that taught me how to do this shit.  It was.  Yeah.  God looked a lot like you.  Absolutely.  And then you go into detail about Desiree Washington in the book.  Wow.  Yeah.  A lot more than the one-man show, by the way.  Yeah.  Because the one-man show is only an hour and a half.  You can't really get into it.  By the way, it's on, sorry to interrupt you, it's on 8 o'clock on HBO Films.  Yeah.  Undisputed Truth, it's called.  It airs on HBO Saturday, and it's fucking amazing.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  I saw it twice, and it's an amazing show.  I haven't seen it on HBO.  Of course, man.  Of course.  Yeah, I went too. 
[03:52:30]  Amazing.  Geez.  I was there, Mike.  But you don't get the same energy that Heath has.  I know.  He comes up, hey, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.  Really good, Mike.  That fucking jittery energy is beautiful shit, man.  It's just described as Jimmy's perfect.  And he got the blink down.  He's got it.  He's got it.  It's Mike Tyson's Jimmy impression is down.  It's great.  I actually went home, and he went backstage, and I'm like, I don't want to bother him.  Just tell him I liked it, too.  It was good shit.  I loved it, actually.  But you really get into the Desiree Washington stuff in the book, which was-  It explains things that you seem like, when you hear things on the news, you're like, 
[03:53:00]  how does this happen?  And then you go through every detail about the fucking-  I was so angry reading this book about the fucking defense attorneys and about Desiree,  and you explain everything, and it makes complete sense how it happened.  And, like, it's stuff that I had no idea.  And now I know.  You know, at that time in my life, I was acting like a real prick, you know?  So all that stuff with bad karma and stuff, it really came back to haunt me.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of bad karma and disrespecting people back then, because I'm the fucking baddest man 
[03:53:30]  in the world for the planet it was.  Right, right.  The baddest motherfucker kicked your ass.  And all that shit just came back to haunt you.  That bad karma.  And you run into some other people with some bad shit.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Did you ever get the feeling that, I don't know, society on a whole just wanted to put  you in check?  Well, you know, me feeling sorry for myself, I think that way.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  But I have a lot of that to do with my conduct.  You know, I wanted to be a guy uncheckable.  Right, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You talk a lot about yourself, too. 
[03:54:00]  Like, you look back and you're like, I was a selfish pig.  I was disgusting.  Like, you really go back and kind of analyze yourself, you know, in ways that we do that  are honest.  Like, I was behaving a certain way and this is what I was.  But it's good to have that ability to see that.  Right.  Well, you know, I see that.  I don't conduct myself that way now.  And I see the different results.  You know, and if I was continuing to act in that particular conduct, I would still have  the same results.  And were there people back then telling you to act in a specific way and you would like, 
[03:54:30]  hey, fuck you.  I know everything.  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah, pretty much.  Motherfucker, you ain't win no motherfucking title, nigga.  Fuck you, motherfucker.  You ain't never do shit and you got all the best advice in the world.  Right.  You know, that's...  And then after a few years, like, no, that motherfucker was right.  Shit.  Obviously, he wasn't right.  I was just wrong.  He was not right.  I was just wrong.  I mean, we don't have enough time, but I'm assuming that you're relieved that you got  the Desiree Washington story now in this book for everyone to read.  Hey, listen.  Because there's a lot to it that people just didn't know. 
[03:55:00]  Mm-hmm.  What happened?  You're interrupting Mike Tyson.  Here comes fucking Thomas Jefferson.  Black Jim.  It's fucking...  But it's got to be good that it's on the record now in your words.  I'm just...  Really?  No.  It doesn't mean nothing about that.  And I'm just happy that it's over.  Yeah, no shit.  You know?  I'm just happy that it's over.  It's going to always be there.  And regardless of what people think about it, I really...  That's just not who I am.  It's not in my system no more.  I'm just moving on in my life.  Nice.  Obviously, yeah.  I don't have to have no plastic... 
[03:55:30]  I believe she had plastic surgery.  She got changed up job.  I used to have to do that.  When I come and walk in the world, I walk who I am.  This is me, Mike Tyson.  This is what you get.  And that's how it's always going to be.  Did you ever see yourself in this position earlier on in your career?  Were you ever thinking, wow, when I'm done boxing and I get a little older, maybe I'll wise up a little bit?  No, I didn't think I lived that long.  Oh, really?  Who would want to think about it? 
[03:56:00]  I was living like a rock star.  Who would want to be an old rock star?  And then you realize being an old rock star is kind of cool.  Mick Jagger still gets blown.  Yeah.  Fuck, Nicky!  He's beautiful.  I see Rod Stewart too, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He's still...  Rango, Tango, Django.  Goddamn Mike Tyson.  Holy shit.  Do you have people in your life or anyone...  Like you said, you were using it for a long time.  I don't know if anybody called you on it.  Do you have...  Like you said, Cuss died and then your sister died. 
[03:56:30]  People who would really rip into you when you...  And people...  You need that.  Like people who care about you enough to risk losing you.  I don't know.  Who's going to tell the youngest Harry Wayne, the champ, what to do?  And everybody telling him what he does is great.  No, no.  I mean now.  Do you have friends that will go like, oh, Mike, stop you.  My friends, fuck, my wife would kick me in the ass.  My friends, please.  My wife is my biggest fucking watchdog.  Fucking Pitbull City, dude.  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[03:57:00]  Today my wife was saying, I almost fell in love with you again when I saw you last night  on stage talking with the owner of the library.  I almost fell in love with you again.  And then I realized, you're just a manipulator.  You're just a manipulator.  You don't care.  You would have kicked your daughter in the face if she came on stage to steal your thunder.  You don't care.  You're just selfish and you have some megalomania.  And I said, where is this coming from?  Because you almost had me fooled that you were a wonderful guy.  I said, come on, stop, baby, okay?  She said, I was going to bust my chops. 
[03:57:30]  She said, the day I was saying, I'm not going today because you're not going to iron my stuff.  I'm not going to take no shower.  She said, you wouldn't miss the moment to be on radio and television, to be with Howard  Stern and Annie and Oprah.  You would never miss that moment.  I don't believe that.  Ain't this some shit?  It's nice, though, isn't it?  To have somebody who kind of knows that we're full of shit sometimes and likes us anyway.  There's something really comforting about that.  They ground you.  They like us anyway.  They want to kiss us with our morning stinking shit fucking gasoline smelling breath, right? 
[03:58:00]  They wolf-bang breath and they still want to kiss us.  A little tongue like sandpaper and they still want to kiss us, you know?  What the hell?  That's how you know you're in love.  When you have to shit and you don't have to make up an excuse like you're going to shower,  that's how I know I'm in a comfortable relationship.  And you shit, you want to run to bed real quick so you don't have time to wipe to get the strokes in.  I got to be honest, that's white boy nasty.  Black people would never like me to talk about that. 
[03:58:30]  That's some real fucking dingy dude, man.  You're a fucking dingy dude.  We got to get Mike out of here for another interview.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Come on.  This is the place.  Oh, man.  It's not up to us.  Because once I leave this place, I'm going to be, you know, pretty much Uncle Tom Mike.  Yes, ma'am.  Directly speaking, yes, I did appropriate it.  Yes, thank you so much.  I would like to talk about that.  This shit's going to change, man.  I'll be ringing the bell at the stock market later this afternoon.  I'll be closing bell.  And I'm very grateful.  All of them very patricious white people really are willing to have me here and join them. 
[03:59:00]  And this is something that will be a highlight of my career.  And I'm very grateful.  And I'm trying to show gratefulness by being very gratitude for this moment.  And I'm conveying gratitude.  Well, good for you, Mike.  Good for you.  Sir, by any chance, may I wipe your ass, please?  I will manicure your pubic hair in your ass, sir.  I'm built to do this.  Oh, man.  He's a new man.  This is the Mike Tyson we've been waiting for. 
[03:59:30]  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Please, please.  I'll pick your cotton in South Carolina as well.  You never disappoint, sir.  Oh, shit.  There's nobody better than Mike Tyson.  I love it.  Can we play everything properly?  Yes, please.  The book is out.  Undisputed Truth is out.  It's amazing.  It's absolutely amazing.  It's time to come see me do this signing.  I'm an ex-rebellious slave that's seen the light.  Come on.  Don't worry.  I won't bite your ears and stuff.  I won't kiss your feet.  Mike, you're fantastic every time you come here.  We love having you in here, man. 
[04:00:00]  You're so much fun.  And just a fucking legend.  And it's great to have you, man.  And stick around.  I'm doing my advice show after.  Oh, you're right.  Yes, I am.  I'll listen to that on the way home.  What are you going to give advice on, particularly?  Whatever they call in about.  They call in and they ask for advice on, you know, sex addiction and stuff.  I do what I can.  Have you ever been to a, to get help for sex addiction?  Yeah, I've gone to a few meetings.  What do you think about that?  The meeting there is just really weird stuff.  You got to go to the right guy.  Yeah.  You know.  Hmm.  Hmm.  There's some interesting, Pat Korn. 
[04:00:30]  Yeah, Korn.  You ever heard of him?  Mm-mm.  Oh, man.  The best guy in sex addiction.  Oh, is he an author?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I actually have heard of him.  Yeah.  In the Shadows.  Something like that.  That's the book he wrote?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My ex-girlfriend many years ago gave me that.  Here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Check it out, man.  She knew there was a problem.  That's a hell of a stocking stuffer.  In the Shadows, man.  You need for a hell of a Christmas.  Always lonely, right?  Always alone.  Always feeling lonely.  The worst is yet to come.  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013. 
[04:01:00]  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  It continues right now.  It is 2013.  Well, the worst of 2013 for Opie and Anthony.  My name is Erock, and we're down to our last segment of the day.  Day eight is coming to an end.  And what would it be if we didn't have some highlights for the year that was for Uncle Paul?  We've already featured Chip.  We have to feature Uncle Paul. 
[04:01:30]  What would a year be if we didn't have any Chip or Uncle Paul?  A good year.  ONA's worst of 2013.  The nice rough surface of the pool this year, because I got it recoded this year, and the  warm water.  Everyone that came over has baby soft feet now on the bottom, but the kids that do have  baby soft feet, they'd walk out of the pool going, I need Band-Aids, and their toes are  bleeding.  Yeah, because you've got to kiss them when their feet are sore. 
[04:02:00]  Oh, no.  Make sure the vinegar's off your lips.  Sometimes I would do turkey foot on a sore toe after I was eating sour cream and onion  and the salt and vinegar potato chips.  Oh, that's got to hurt the young child.  What's that?  Yeah.  I'd be eating the salt and vinegar potato chips.  What's that?  And I would wind up hurting their feet.  He's answering himself.  They would go, ouch!  He's checking the door locks.  He's talking to himself.  It boins!  It boins!  It boins!  Yeah.  Bam!  Little soft tootsies. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They get vinegar on my lips.  Of course, Uncle Paul.  Sometimes I rub vinegar on my gums.  Why do you do that?  Someone told me I had bad breath.  Oh, what does vinegar do?  It's supposed to kill all the tartar and plaque that's built up.  You should just brush.  I don't go to no dentist.  They knock you out, then they start taking all the pictures out of your wallet.  Wallet.  I don't go to no dentist.  Why would you go to the dentist with all your pictures? 
[04:03:00]  That's right.  Yeah.  Why would you do that?  Why don't you leave them at home?  Toothbrushes make my gums bleed a lot.  So I just rub a little vinegar on my gums once every couple of days.  Right with the vinegar on your gums.  And on my lips.  Creepy.  So my breath is fresh.  Oh, come on.  Vinegar breath.  What a frightening man.  Then you start kissing the little tootsies.  Of course you do.  I got a soft foot.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[04:03:30]  You little turkey footin'.  Disgusting.  Little turkey footin' on Halloween.  My tootsies are stinky.  I'll get them.  You're just a fucking horrendous person.  Yeah?  Yeah.  About you.  All right.  All right.  Do you smell his underpants?  The king of pop?  Yes.  He is the king of pop?  Yes.  God.  I go, oh, he smells just like my underwear smell.  I would wear them.  Oh.  Not like for a long period of time.  Well, believe me. 
[04:04:00]  I would put them on.  When you were popping that quarter off your ankle, you probably could have gone over there  and smelled his underwear.  Yeah.  Everything that's under it.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  After I taught you, I see London, I see France, I see Sammy's underpants.  Oh.  I'd do the smell check while you were wearing them.  I'd spread your legs and bury my nose in there.  Oh, he's rutting.  He's rutting around in your drawers.  He's getting your nose in there, trying to find a truffle. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah.  A little shit truffle.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  That is disgusting.  God damn it.  I'm quite certain I would have remembered that.  Yeah.  I remember your little slippy footy PJs.  I'd throw you on your stomach by force and bury my nose in there and see if you was mining  your P's and Q's.  And you'd be flicking your little ankle in my hands. 
[04:05:00]  Click, click, click, click, click, click.  And I'd be opening up your legs like a wishbone smelling.  I'd get in there at my nose.  Sometimes I'd pull my nose out.  Your little, your little feetie pajamas would be crammed into your bottom because of the  force in which I use my nose.  You'd forget to open the hatch.  You'd be so into it.  You wouldn't open the hatch.  Yeah.  I'd slam my face in there.  It looked like that plane hitting a runway in Russia. 
[04:05:30]  Shit.  I would love to know what's going on inside you.  That you have to act these.  That's fantastic.  Act these out.  What happened to you?  Oh, probably lots of things.  Yeah.  I've got a great imagination, but I don't know.  That's based on something.  Just an imaginative little boy.  Yeah.  Holding your ankles while they flicked.  Way too visual.  They're like little kites.  Oh, they're just clicking. 
[04:06:00]  Yeah.  His clicking ankles.  You were trying to flick my fingers off like they were five nickels.  No dice.  It's a defense mechanism.  To keep people's fingers off of you.  Yeah.  Click.  I'd pick you up by your ankles and get in there and sniff.  Sniff your little multicolored bag.  The front of your underpants would always smell like tinkle because of your ballooning  force.  His ballooning force. 
[04:06:30]  He's got the facts.  Maybe there is some truth to this.  Yeah, your little ballooning foreskin.  I heard that on the after show the other day when you were talking about your 19-year-old  circumcision.  Yes.  That you got when you were 19.  Mm-hmm.  And how you take a piss and the hole was so small in the foreskin that the foreskin  would blow up like a water balloon.  True.  It's so fucked up.  Yeah.  True.  Wow.  Sure, it would always leak into your little Hulk Hogan underpants.  I could always tell when you made a wet.  Why would you think that's normal, Sam Roberts? 
[04:07:00]  Well, if you don't...  Why didn't you show mommy that?  Because there's no reason to not think it's normal if you don't see...  You thought everyone had a balloon dick?  Of course.  Why wouldn't...  If that's the only dick you see, you're like, oh, God.  He did show mommy.  She said to me, Paul, check that out.  Is that normal?  And I took you in a room and checked it out for a few hours.  Got in there and cleaned it.  I don't think we knew each other back then.  Yeah.  And that's today's look at the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony will return live on Monday, January 6th.
