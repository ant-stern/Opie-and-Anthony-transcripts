<pre> One must know evil before he can condemn it.  Opie.  One must see evil before he can denounce it.  Anthony.  This is disgusting and it's very, very cool.  How?  F.N.  What?  1027 W-A-W, it's Opie, it's Anthony, it's Lewis Black from The Daily Show on Comedy Central.  If you want to talk to Lewis about anything that's going on in the news locally, nationally, whatever, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  I guess we need Lewis' take on Hillary, the carpet bagger. 
[00:30]
 I'd say it's really worth it, here.  I don't know, that's the least of my worries, you know?  Why do they even bring that up?  Who cares?  That she's a carpet bagger?  I, you know, we, you know, any, that would be a good, you know, if somebody, if there was a good carpet bagger, it'd be good, wouldn't it?  But she's not a good carpet bagger, so don't worry about it.  The fact is, is we wrote a law that says somebody can live here for a day, which is about all it takes to become one of us schmucks.  So, I mean, you know, what's the degree of difficulty?  You don't worry about that, but the fact is, it's not that she's a girl, who cares about it? 
[01:00]
 It's that she's Hillary Clinton, that's worse, dragging that baggage around.  Look, I've already lived with that peckerwood down there for eight years.  I don't need her sashaying about, you know, so I gotta go through this for another six, so that 14 years of my life,  I gotta spend at least some part of the day thinking, who, who, this guy got his winky bone by a 21-year-old.  I don't care what happens, I don't care what occurs for the rest of my life.  Whenever you see him, at some point, you go, oh yeah, that's him, first lady, oh, oh, I forgot her winky bone, yeah, that's me. 
[01:30]
 At some point, that's what you think, and I'm tired of it.  That means Chelsea, that, I gotta watch her, oh, what happened to her, oh, poor girl, oh boy, son of a gun.  She was on a boat with the Kennedys this week.  I saw it, I just, see that, I took my leg, I said wow, that's the difference between us and them, wouldn't see us on a boat with them.  No, no, no, no.  And, and, you know, if I was her, I wouldn't go anywhere with any Kennedys at this point.  You know, why are they, why are they boating, too, if you're a Kennedys, I think you should just be in a cryogenic freeze chamber. 
[02:00]
 Something like just, all right, just don't touch me, don't look at me, I'm a Kennedys, you never know, a boulder's gonna fall out.  But apparently the women, the women seem never to die, if you notice that.  That's true.  They live forever.  They are already cryogenically frozen, just give them lobotomy.  Yeah, this one came out a little retarded.  Put a couple of bolts through the head.  Yeah, boy, that's a good one, you know, here was the angry one, who were able to get rid of that problem. 
[02:30]
 But you got, but you got Hillary, who I think, I'm getting the thing, maybe, you know, what, maybe, what if she's got a d***?  Maybe.  No, really, seriously, what if she's got a d***?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I know they dumped out of that, so you're wondering if, uh, then maybe.  Oh, they did?  Then maybe.  You're wondering, possibly that Hillary might have a schwee.  Yeah, oh yeah, sorry.  Okay, sorry, something like that.  I never know what the rules are here.  Well, they don't, they've up the rules lately, since you've been here.  I'm really, I apologize.  That's okay.  Please, all of you out there who don't, who never even seen one, I apologize. 
[03:00]
 I call it a pesky.  So Hillary's got, you know, what if she does have a d***?  I wouldn't doubt it.  You know, and that's the reason.  Right.  That's the reason that the whole thing has been like this.  And then we're, and that's the sad thing, and then we're going to have to learn this, like, you know, when she's 77 and she finally says,  Oh, here, you know, we got a picture of her and Mike Hustler showing her schwee.  At the very end of the career.  And then she's, you know, and the other thing is, is so irksome about it, is then, she's running against Giuliani.  And the only reason, you know, I vote for Giuliani is to get him out of here. 
[03:30]
 You know?  I mean, it's like, I don't need him running around as a representative of us.  Okay?  That kind of autocratic, you know, son of a, you know, it's like, he's hugging and then what's his name?  Yes, they just hit me, Michael Moore, give me a noogie.  That was, oh, please.  Don't give me noogies.  You're ruining my comb over.  He's suffering fricking tannery.  You know, and the thing, I mean, I'll never get over it.  I mean, Giuliani took so much credit for what went on here.  Right. 
[04:00]
 I will never, I have no truck with him.  You know, we lived here.  If we didn't live here, he wouldn't have a city.  The idiot, all right, okay, man, I was like, you know, I'm going to take care of gridlock.  Oh, I'm glad he's taking care of gridlock.  Okay, something to do.  At least they're not out pounding people this week.  You know?  I mean, I think the cops do a great job here, but it's like, you know, with him, like kind of revving them up, you know, I just kind of feel it.  Something's wrong.  It's just wrong.  We need a third choice, I believe.  We need a third choice.  And I think, I think some sort of animal. 
[04:30]
 That's how I always believe.  I was thinking ex-wrestler, maybe animal, you know, there's a few more ex-wrestlers out there we can pick.  You know, Ventura is absolute proof that Minnesota is not filled with the social drinkers.  They're a land of alcoholics.  But you know what the dream come true would be?  That this trend continues and every state has their own wrestler governor.  That's right.  They could just get there and go, listen here, Minnesota, I'm coming for you.  You know, you're all hopped up with your revenue and stuff. 
[05:00]
 And we've been down in the dumps, but we're coming back.  Legalized prostitution.  And that's always good.  It's always good for the state and the family to see the governor in a wrestling ring, a referee.  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's good.  That's always good.  You know, that's always a nice, tasteful thing.  I don't know who the third party should be.  Big, giant tortoise.  What's a big tortoise?  Just a big tortoise, some big sand tortoise.  And you've got a yes side to no side. 
[05:30]
 You ask them a question and they're like, yes, it's a mope.  That's it.  That's the way we go.  The damn thing would win, man.  Just vote for the big tortoise.  And then the presidential thing is enough.  I'm nauseous.  So that Bush.  Bush in the cocaine, what do you think?  Didn't do it.  Didn't do it.  Isn't it unbelievable?  It keeps backing off seven years, four and a half years, nine, 12, one or eight, 16.  I fight.  Once you started open the can of worms, it's like, first off, I don't like looking at him  either. 
[06:00]
 All it does is remind me of his father and I'm like, oh, oh, younger and creepier.  Oh, oh, that's what spawned the older one.  Oh, I just don't get it.  I mean, you know, you did cocaine.  If you didn't, help.  Just say it.  Just say it.  What's the big deal?  Not going to play by those rules.  Not going to play by those rules.  Not going to play.  It sounds just like him, doesn't it?  He does.  Not going to play.  Going to distract you by electrocuting some more Negroes.  And you know, they say, you know, this is the main thing with him is just that he's leading  the polls.  Nobody knows who he is.  Nobody knows.  I mean, I was in Arizona last week and there's a few of them go, oh, you know, I said George  W. Bush, they go, hoo-hoo.  I'm going, you don't even know who he is.  They get out.

You could possibly be worried about what?  What?  The fact that she's speaking aloud, that's the end of it.  You're kind of, because it forces you to drift out.  I find myself drifting out.  I wake up.  I don't know why I'm in the room. 
[12:30]
 Son of a gun.  And meanwhile, Regis is becoming a gazillionaire.  All of a sudden, Regis falls in on a show where it is like, you know, every day I got to read about that.  I know.  How little is happening.  Oh my God, this is the greatest show ever.  Oh man, people are going to have a big, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it's insanity.  Every day.  And he's becoming popular.  Meanwhile, his hair is becoming a color that I don't think exists on the human spectrum.  Traol is putting out Regis White. 
[13:00]
 Have you watched that show?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  You look out, you guys, I've had it.  I know.  Well, we've got to check out this stuff so we can riff on it a little bit.  I should, but I'm unable to bring myself to sit down and watch it.  It's like getting to your taxes or anything else.  Eventually, you got to do it, you know.  What is this, like three more days of it or something like that?  Something like that, yeah.  Oh man, oh God.  I'm saving television, Gohmins.  Good, Kathy Lee, a Cleveland Steamer.  Dudes with dudes. 
[13:30]
 I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  Both of you, Anthony.  We're out of control.  We're so lucky.  All right, knock it off.  1027.  What is this stupid thing we've got to do in here?  Don't even try to figure it out.  Just go along with it.  What happened?  1027.  Hello?  Hello, sir.  I'm an elderly gentleman and I need a motorized scooter.  They call my name's Bill.  What's your name, sir?  They call my name's Bill. 
[14:00]
 Bill?  Yes.  Have you seen any particular type that you like?  I liked the little rascal.  The rascal?  I saw that on TV.  I'm a little rascal.  I'm a little rascal in my little rascal.  Uh-huh.  Is what the woman said.  That's what the woman said, huh?  And she's getting around, she's shopping and eating ice cream.  How fast does it go, sir?  The fastest is about five miles an hour.  I flew a P-51 Mustang in the big one. 
[14:30]
 Yeah, it won't go that fast.  Oh, it won't?  No.  I need also a room in the back for an oxygen tank because I'm on oxygen.  Oh, I see.  And it's got to have good suspension because I don't want my colostomy bag dislodging.  No, you don't want that either.  No.  The bigger machines will have like a spring suspension in the front.  Oh, boy.  My friend Petey's got one and it's a real chick magnet.  He goes around at the bingo game and he gives the girls rides on the back. 
[15:00]
 Can I get a two-seater?  No, you can't get a two-seater.  But I can't be jostled around too much.  I got a prostate like a porcupine.  Oh, I see.  That's kind of tough.  You can stop by our showroom.  We have three or four models on the floor and we get them in.  Excuse me, sir.  How the hell am I supposed to get there?  You're not driving anymore?  No.  I drove in a lake and they took my car away.  Oh, I see.  Can I take one of these like on major highways?  No, you cannot.  Because my grandson lives far away and I like to play some ball with him. 
[15:30]
 No, you can't do that.  I can't?  No.  The furthest they'll go is about 24, 25 miles.  Is that the furthest range?  Yeah, and they go about five miles an hour.  So you'd be kind of lost on the highway, don't you think?  I don't have much.  I have nothing else to do.  What else am I going to do with my time?  If it takes me two hours to get 10 miles, I don't care.  Also, I lost my arm in the big one.  Oh, you did?  Do you have any kind of catapult so I could play ball with my grandson?  Like a pitching arm or something? 
[16:00]
 No.  They call my name's Bill.  Could you just come over and shoot me in the head?  No.  I mean, hell, I was big once.  I was in the war.  I was a commander.  And now I got to drive on a three-wheel battery powered scooter?  Yes, sir.  This is degrading.  It is degrading.  Sam, could you just shoot me?  Could you take a goddamn gun and shoot me in the freaking head?  No, I don't think so.  Come down.  Put my head under a wheel of one of the scooters and hit go. 
[16:30]
 I don't think they would do anything.  Could you do that to me, Tony?  No, I don't think so.  They just hit me in the brain stem with a ball-peen hammer, Sam.  Could you do that?  No, no, I don't think so.  I mean, hell, I haven't been laid since the Kaiser was in Germany, for Christ's sake.  I have big baloney breasts.  I haven't seen a naked woman in 42 years.  That's a long time.  Do you know what that's like?  My pants are up to my nipples and I'm calling for a scooter. 
[17:00]
 What's your last name, Bill?  I have wrap-around eyeglasses that look like the freaking Terminator, Sam.  I've lived for 85 years.  It's enough already, for Christ's sake.  Kill me!  Could someone just kill me?  My name is Bill.  They call my name Bill.  Oh, Jesus.  My teeth just fell off.  My freaking teeth.  I spit my teeth out of my head. 
[17:30]
 Kill me!  Somebody just kill me, for Christ's sake!  Hey, hey!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I have no clue what anybody's saying, but it's the funniest damn show.  More stupidity on the way.  1027.  1027 WNW, it's The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey.  Sorry.  Off to another fine start today, Anthony? 
[18:00]
 Yes.  Right off the bat, what the hell are mic flags around here now?  What is this?  Is this the cheesiest?  It's pieces of paper that say 1027 WNW on little square things.  Let's rip it off and get a man.  Ah, see, they're on to me.  They tighten the screw really tight.  Oh, there we go.  There we go.  There we go.  Na na na na na na na. 
[18:30]
 We said we don't want any mic flags.  There you go.  There's yours.  Be patient a couple of seconds.  Our mics are back to normal.  We keep telling people, Aunt and I can't see each other with these stupid huge mic flags and the microphones.  We hate those mic flags.  There are people around here that really need to get a real job.  This is their job to put mic flags on the mic every day. 
[19:00]
 There you go.  I'm going to take this little FM Talk 10271 home, though.  A little memento.  I'll leave it over here in the corner.  Much better.  Hey, home.  There you are.  How are you?  Good.  I'm exhausted already.  I know.  We've had a great hour of radio so far.  I think we've done enough today.  Hey, give me the...  God damn that thing.  I hate that.  Everyone steps on my effing headphones board.  You know something?  It might sound a little nitpicky.  Can we get a jack where I sit? 
[19:30]
 Where is your...  The jack's like way over to my right.  Everyone steps on it.  Man, you're changing.  Jay Moore almost took my head off.  You're starting to get an attitude and stuff.  That's what it is, Uncle.  You're starting to get an attitude.  I demand things, you know.  I demand it.  It's a plus.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.

I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack. 
[21:00]
 I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack. 
[21:30]
 I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  I'm going to get a jack.  Well, it'll be on the unofficial website too.  But oh my God, the picture, I don't know which one is more adorable.  You sticking your head through the giant pumpkin cutout or you pulling the little red wagon  with the pumpkin thing.  I got to say though, thank you.  I was hoping you were going to say it on your own without me having to point something out. 
[22:00]
 That's very obvious in those pictures.  Well, no, the one with you sticking through the pumpkin, I can't really see it as much.  But pulling the wagon, I got to admit your face, you look like you really don't want  to be there.  No, I got to go with you.  No, why?  Because the Mets were in extra ratings at that point.  We went over that whole story.  I lost the reception at that point.  So I had no choice to go pumpkin picking instead of watching and listening to the rest of the 
[22:30]
 Met game.  Pumpkin picking.  Boy, those are some big pumpkins.  I can't wait till those are up and running on some side or another.  Caesar, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I've been listening to you guys for like five or six months now.  And unfortunately, I'm going to have to let you guys go for like three months because  I'm off the boot camp.  Boot camp?  Yeah, I'm going to the Marines, Parris Island.  Hey, congrats.  Thanks.  Is there any way you guys can maybe set me up with a banging before I leave, or something? 
[23:00]
 When are you leaving?  The 18th.  I've got to be some, you know, girls crazy to bang them or something.  I don't know.  Well, dude, you got it.  The reason we started my brother, my brother's off of going with me.  Maybe we can put on a rotisserie or something.  Got to do it.  You have to.  We have one rule on our radio show.  It's such a distraction when we can hear the radio show in the background because we're  on a 40 second delay. 
[23:30]
 Yes.  I keep telling you guys, if we hear the radio on when you're live on the air, we've got  to just we just got to hang up on you.  Because all the email comes in, people get really frustrated at all the really bad phone  calls we get on this radio show.  And one of the reasons is because people want to hear themselves on the radio.  So they're distracted.  They're trying to listen to the show and talk to us at the same time.  Yeah.  Turn your radio down, please.  Everyone knows that already.  Ed, what's going on?  Yeah, I was wondering, is it official now that you're a pussy whip fag over here?  Yeah. 
[24:00]
 I mean, you know, on the New York radio message board, that's the latest rumor.  That you're a fag?  Yeah.  Rumor or a fag?  Rumor.  The faithful listeners are pounding that thing.  I feel sorry for Alan Smith and the rock and roll dentist.  Hey, listen, Opie, I'm a conductor for the Long Island Marriott.  Are you?  Yeah.  And I'll reserve the fag car for you if you want.  The fag car?  Yeah.  It sounds like you know all about the fag car.  That's me.  You know it.  But you love it.  There's the beer car and there's the fag car that Ed runs. 
[24:30]
 Instant feedback's coming in.  A lot of them saying, when's the rock coming in?  The rock is coming in at 5 o'clock today.  We're very, very excited.  We hope he's going to be excited to be on our fine radio show, Anthony.  What was he on, The View this morning?  He was on The View.  With the Bobwe?  That's a tough booking.  The Rock on The View.  Rock on The View.  A bunch of old ladies watched The View.  Any guy that's on The View. 
[25:00]
 We got to ask him about that right off the bat, how it felt, because what is he going  to get accomplished there?  A guy on The View.  Yeah, the audience isn't quite the wrestling demographic.  No.  I wouldn't think.  It's a bunch of tea slurping old bags sit around watching The View.  They're all as old as like Mae Young.  Yeah.  That watched The View.  And any guy I've ever seen on there, it's like, why the hell would you go on The View?  Our own pal from Comedy Central.  What's his name?  Going to be in tomorrow.  Lewis Black? 
[25:30]
 Lewis Black.  Lewis Black was on The View.  What the hell is Lewis Black doing on The View?  It's their managers and stuff.  It's their people.  It's their handlers, Ant.  They talk you into it.  They say, hey, this would be good for you.  We've had some offers to do certain shows.  We've certain TV shows that we just deny.  To be honest with you, I think we have denied everything.  Every single TV offer that comes in, because you know why?  We look like idiots doing it.  Right.  We know that.  We don't have to be on TV. 
[26:00]
 And then there's TV shows trying to split us up.  Like, we only want Ant.  Yeah.  It's like, no.  Stupid.  Like sort of one of those Bill Maher shows.  Oh, we did turn down.  Politically incorrect.  We did turn down politically incorrect, because we hate Bill Maher.  The next time we see him, we're going to punch him in the face.  Punch him in that huge forehead.  But they wanted us to be like the announcer voice when he was filming here in New York.  Yeah.  We're not going to do it.  We don't want to make him die. 
[26:30]
 We think he sucks.  Bill Maher.  Meant some Fox show.  Wanted us to do something.  Local Fox show that runs at like 3.30 in the morning.  Yeah.  I want...  You know, leave that to the public homes of the radio industry.  We'll take exposure anyway we can get it, but...  Not to make our own news.  But we're still out drinking at 3.30.  Yeah.  If it was 5 a.m., then we would talk.  Can't quite make it.  Right.  You didn't happen to see Tubby Tom's appearance on that MTV show?  They rate... 
[27:00]
 Oh, the list on the list.  VH1.  VH1.  Whatever the hell it is.  Boy, I'm not knowing much of anything today.  I'm like, what is that?  Who was that?  Why?  Who?  I'm shocked.  Tom Likers with his Down syndrome haircut.  Oh my God.  You know, he shouldn't go on TV.  He really shouldn't.  I don't get it.  That Mongoloid hairdo, the Down syndrome haircut.  What's he doing?  God, I just... 
[27:30]
 Come on!  Can't stand him and can't stand his radio show.  Can't stomach it.  Try... you know, gave it a try for like five minutes.  No, I'll be honest.  I gave it a couple weeks.  Five minutes in a clip.  Tated him when I knew he was coming here.  Said, all right, I will put all that aside even though we like battled in the beginning.  I said, okay, I'll have an open mind.  I think everyone should at least have an open mind.  And then I listened as much as I could.  And it's just God awful.  It's just God awful. 
[28:00]
 Horrid.  Oh man.  What?  It's line two, Steve.  Will Owen Hague do the Rosie O'Donnell show?  Yeah.  Steve!  Yo, what's up?  What's up?  Why don't you guys go in Rosie?  Yeah, Rosie.  Come on.  That's another show.  What guy... what self-respecting man would go on that show?  Some fake.  Every day you see the guys in the audience.  Oh my God!  You know they're whippable.  I love you, Rosie.  Rosie, I love you.  Rosie would never have us on first of all.  Yeah.  What's up with adopting this third child?  Like give me a break.  She's eating him.  I feel like I'm going to have to go on that show. 
[28:30]
 I don't know.  We should do it.  Yeah, that would be nice.  I love you.  Rosie would never have us on first of all.  What's up with adopting this third child?  Give me a break.  She's eating them.  She's snacking on them and she's halfway through the second one and she needs another.  Give me the baby.  I want that baby in my belly.  I'll tell you what's up with that.  Rosie wants to pretty much save the world and if it means like adopting 17 kids she's  going to do it.  She's one of those. 
[29:00]
 She's going to save the world but meanwhile she thinks she's the type of person who is  just all good.  A perfect role model for everybody else.  She's going to adopt these children and take them away from a life of horror I guess.  She is a horror.  And be Rosie O'Donnell, perfect person that she thinks she is.  She knows all the right things and anybody that doesn't agree with her is wrong.  She gets on that show of hers and starts preaching, oh my God. 
[29:30]
 Oh, shut up.  Christ.  First of all, she gets on a bandwagon with that Chubb Club thing, tries to preach about  that.  You can't even lose weight yourself.  She hasn't lost a pound.  Before you start getting on your vehicle and preaching a cause, please try to do it yourself  first.  Before you branch out.  If you slimmed down a bit and then started your Chubb Club to get other people to slim  down, hey sure, why not?  It's kind of like an alcoholic telling everyone else not to drink. 
[30:00]
 Don't drink.  Don't drink.  Pop another beer.  You're just slamming them in the background.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, did you guys see the man show last night?  Yes, I did.  It was that game, Hungry Hungry Opras.  Oh my God.  It was the Hungry Hungry Hippo game, but it was Oprah.  And it had these little miniature hamburgers.  Oh my God, I've got to go guys.  The man show was pretty funny.  It was like a retrospective of the past year.  It was hilarious last night at Comedy Central. 
[30:30]
 And I was watching with my brother, Sandy was there and Sandy's sister.  And they did the whole lingerie segment.  Did you see that?  Oh man, all the chicks from the show.  What are they called?  The Juggies.  The Juggies or the Jiblees or the Jiggalese?  The Juggies.  The Juggies?  Yeah, they were...  They're going into the dressing room and trying all the hottest lingerie and that one blonde  that is just like, woohoo!  She was huge.  Right.  And Sandy is just getting more and more agitated.  Really? 
[31:00]
 More and more agitated.  Every hot woman that is appearing on the TV, me and my brother are just losing it, loving  life.  And my brother had the line of the night last night, he goes, Sandy, I don't think this  segment is catering toward you.  Right.  You know?  Exactly.  Because she's like, oh my God, her boobs are so blown up and big and look at that.  Is she getting pissed?  Oh yeah.  Does she need another cruise?  I'd be glad to send her.  You know what?  I think I'm going to have to write a check live on a radio show for you. 
[31:30]
 Are you going to do that?  Are you serious?  It's going to kill me.  It's going to kill me but I'm going to do it.  You're actually going to pay for Sandy's cruise?  Yeah.  You've got to explain, without explaining obviously, what we're talking about.  Well, my wife Jen, she's a little pissed off I guess and decided to go on a cruise on  my American Express card and took Sandy, your girlfriend, with her. 
[32:00]
 And you just assumed like Sandy paid her way and your wife paid her way.  No, no, no.  All charges went on my Amex.  I paid for your girlfriend's cruise.  I bought a cruise for your girlfriend.  Airfare, down to Florida, the cruise in the Caribbean, wherever they went.  Well, she needed a shoulder to cry on.  Well, that's a pretty expensive shoulder.  My God. 
[32:30]
 I know it sucks because now I'm going to have to pay for that cruise.  Yeah.  Okay, I won't deny it.  In all fairness, they're ants like that, dude, whatever.  They scheme behind your back that you don't really have to pay me but I really have to  pay you and I know that.  It's going to come down to though, I'm going to have to pay for that cruise, you have to  pay for the other one and neither one of us got a BJ.  No.  I got nothing.  I got to write a check to you for a great vacation down the Caribbean and I got squat. 
[33:00]
 That's all right.  That's all right.  I'm getting effed.  More ways than one.  That's right.  Jiminy Cricket.  All right.  But The Rock is coming in at five o'clock today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Very excited if The Rock is listening.  You got a bunch of huge fans here on this radio show.  I hope he's The Rock.  I hope he's The Rock.  And not Dwayne.  I hope he throws us around the studio and has a lot of fun up here today.  Yeah.  I want The Rock to come into the studio. 
[33:30]
 I heard on The View he wasn't The Rock really.  He was The Rock a little bit, then he was Dwayne.  He was Dwayne.  We just want The Rock.  I've seen him on the other shows sometimes and he's like, you know, yeah, well, you know,  if you smell what The Rock is cooking, it's like, wait a minute.  You're The Rock.  Right.  You got to be The Rock.  Do what it takes.  Smoke some crack, whatever, drink.  Just come in here as The Rock.  Absolutely.  And you will make us very, very happy.  Extremely happy.  We're like little kids today.  Yeah. 
[34:00]
 For the first time, I'm going to look at one of our guests and go, oh my God, it's a superstar.  Absolutely.  And you know how big that guy is?  You know how tall he is?  It's huge.  And he's going to make us look like all fidgets.  That's right.  And then my girlfriend will be creaming her pants over another guy.  Great.  Yeah, she really loves The Rock.  Oh my God.  She's already in the city walking around just can't wait.  She's all giddy.  She's all dressed up.  Yeah.  That makes a guy feel good.  Oh, she got all dressed up for The Rock? 
[34:30]
 Yeah.  Oh, that's such a double standard, too.  Yeah.  Because like I was just saying about the Man Show last night, I'm sitting there.  It's like girls I will never ever meet on the tube and just great lingerie, huge boobs,  perfect bodies.  You have to sit there a lot.  They're crawling around the floor and you're just losing it.  Any guy would, right?  And she gets pissed because she sees that I'm losing it a little bit.  But it's a TV.  But it's a TV.  But she could just lose it over The Rock to the point where I swear to God, if The Rock 
[35:00]
 said give me a hummer, she would do it.  Oh my God.  Without a doubt.  And she is a nice girl, but she would do it, right?  And Rick would step in and say, Hey Rock, you get your hands off my sister and The Rock  would kill you.  And that would be great to say.  But she finds it completely normal that she could have all these whacked out fantasies  with someone that she will see in the flesh.  Yeah.  Someone in the flesh that maybe a phone number could get slipped to inadvertently. 
[35:30]
 You never know, right?  We can only hope.  Oh my God.  We can only wish.  We can only pray.  And also at four o'clock today on the show, Jeffrey Ross, a very funny guy.  Yeah.  What the hell is going on here?  We're starting to get like real celebrities and real guests.  It's all downhill from here.  I want to go back to, you know, on the way egg shooting and...  Well, we will. 
[36:00]
 And we still are.  And penis weightlifting, that kind of thing.  We have, you know, things like Lesbian for a Day that we still do.  Jeffrey Ross, the king of the one-liner.  He does the roasts on Comedy Central all the time and he's like the hit by far.  And he's appearing at Caroline's tonight.  Is that the deal?  All right.  So we have lots to do, Ant.  Yes, we do.  And a lot of people requesting more.  They call my name, they call my name's Bill.  Oh boy.  Oh Bill.  We need Lesbians for Lewis Black tomorrow.  Why a Bill's coffee shop? 
[36:30]
 We had like ten girls call yesterday to be a lesbian for a day.  Most of them can't make it until next week.  Uh-oh.  And if you're a girl and you want to be a lesbian for a day, we're setting that up  tomorrow because Lewis Black's coming in.  And every time Lewis Black comes in, he says, you know, nothing's going on.  What's going on here?  He hears the show.  What's going on here?  He hears the show and he can't make it in.  And there's debauchery going on, all kinds of fun and hijinks, nudity, lesbians.  And he gets a little upset when he comes in and we don't have that for him. 
[37:00]
 Right.  Definitely.  So if your lady wants to come in and be a lesbian for a day, please give us a call.  Eric, what's going on?  Let me tell you something, guys.  I don't have a big enough sponge to wipe up my girlfriend's mouth when the rock comes  on the damn TV.  It is the most annoying thing in the world.  Tell the guy to put a shirt on or something when he's out there.  I can't take it anymore.  We went to a WWF show with my friend Rob and we're all sitting there.  This guy comes out and I swear within five minutes, she's like hanging on a ring post. 
[37:30]
 And I lose it for the night.  Oh, I know.  What are you going to do?  What can you do with this guy?  You've got to put on a shirt, some overalls.  I take satisfaction in knowing that he's married and he's probably not getting all that poof.  When he's traveling the country.  So he's cursed as well.  Trust me, every guy out there is cursed.  It doesn't matter who you are.  It doesn't matter if you're a big time rock star or a movie star.  We're all cursed.  We all have our own curse out there.  I used to love wrestling. 
[38:00]
 I watched it all the time.  I finally got my girlfriend to turn off the Alleymobile for once and start watching Raw  with me.  The minute she saw The Rock, I can't get away from the TV.  It ruins wrestling for me.  Definitely call in with your questions for The Rock because we're going to do a whole  segment where he talks to you guys.  I've got plenty to say to him.  Thank you.  He's pissed at The Rock.  I don't blame him.  A lot of guys.  All right, we're running late.  We're going to take a quick break and right after the commercials, I think we're going  to play the They Call My Names Bill phone booth bit. 
[38:30]
 Oh boy.  A lot of people are requesting the They Call My Names Bill bits today.  We found a girl that could shoot stuff from a private area.  More scutility on the way.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We appreciate it.  And we have audio from Alan Smith and Tim.  Oh yeah.  He was talking about us on the New York Radio Message Board. 
[39:00]
 Yeah, he does like a real audio radio show kind of thing.  I guess in between cleanings, fillings and x-rays.  Right.  He has time to do a little real audio recording of his opinions of New York Radio.  Well, our faithful listeners attacked the New York Radio Message Board last night.  They continue to attack it as we speak and we kind of told you guys to lay off because it was funny. 
[39:30]
 But yeah, we kind of like the guy actually because he does have an open mind as far as what we're doing here at NW.  One of the few that post on the New York Radio Message Board.  How could you not like your friendly neighborhood dentist?  Right.  You know, seems like a nice enough guy.  Yeah, he's all right.  The only thing is, if you listen to his, what he calls board reflections, it's his own private little radio show on the computer.  Yes.  He sounds like friggin' Tom Lycus. 
[40:00]
 Are you serious?  His voice sounds like Tom Lycus.  Do you want to get into it now?  I guess we could a little bit.  I got it somewhere here.  Keep talking and I got to find it.  I mean, Rick, we're listening to it a little bit and he goes off on a whole thing about us and morning radio and well, he insists we're doing morning.  I hope you were listening yesterday because it was really, really, really funny.  We were talking about the New York Radio Message Board.  There's a bunch of tools that need lives that discuss all the important issues that are, you know, the things that we need to do. 
[40:30]
 That need lives that discuss all the important issues that concern New York Radio.  Or they think are important issues.  And what are some of the examples they've discussed in the past?  Oh my God, should, they come up with these stations I never heard of, should WXAZ do standards?  Right.  And then there's a whole like 20 answers to the question.  What should WNEW do next? 
[41:00]
 And then there's like 20 more people with different opinions.  And they're all old school.  I mean, they're convinced like, you know, all the jocks that used to work here.  Yeah.  Still have something to offer to other radio stations in New York.  Oh, and you hear bring back Dave and Pat St. John and Carol and have them go back to doing classic rock.  It's like, when is the rest of New York Radio going to wake up and realize what a talent Carol Miller is? 
[41:30]
 Oh, yeah, but that's what you get on that.  Like I said, a lot of these guys, I picture them, they have their black and white photo of them by the big radio microphone wearing the suit and tie and holding the one headphone ear very close to their ear as their little promo shot.  And what we're doing here at W just repulses them.  They hate it.  And they're convinced because they hate it.  Everyone else should hate it. 
[42:00]
 Right. So they go on the board and spiel about why we suck and how we suck as the ratings, God willing, continue to rise.  They had a whole discussion how unprofessional we are because like we'll cough and whatever burp and just, you know, do stupid stuff while the mics are on.  Yeah. Maybe our grammar isn't perfect.  Every time we open our yaps loops, as long as we're entertaining and making people laugh, that's all we care about.  They couldn't imagine opening up a mic and broadcasting the way we do. 
[42:30]
 I mean, that is just heinous.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what are you guys, a bunch of pussies?  Why?  Why? You tell everybody to bash this dentist yesterday and now you're kissing butt on them.  No, no, I think you've misunderstood us.  We said bash the board, but we did.  We actually said that Alan's a pretty cool guy and he's had an open mind.  The point we were trying to make yesterday is there's a lot of rumors that have started on the New York radio message board that have no substance whatsoever.  Oh, come on. He put his drill in your mouth.  Shut up, dude. 
[43:00]
 Thanks, Tom.  And the latest being that, you know, Aunt Nia and I are going to mornings.  There's just no truth to that whatsoever.  And he just insists we're going to mornings.  And what happened was the listeners went on the New York radio message board yesterday and started their own rumors.  And that's where the comedy came in.  Yeah, it was a big one.  You guys were making us laugh really hard.  So Alan has responded to all the mess we created yesterday and today, Anthony.  Yes.  I believe this might be the first time Alan's actually doing a show over a major network. 
[43:30]
 Yeah.  He does these like once a week, these board reflections.  And he fixes his opinions on things.  We give him a forum on this show.  You think he'll invite us in to do a root canal one day?  And let's not forget this guy is a dentist.  Yes.  The other WNEW issue which has come up in the last few days is Opie and Anthony.  You know what the problem is when you discuss people like Opie and Anthony and Howard Stern and so forth? 
[44:00]
 The problem is their fans can't seem to discuss this on the level that it ought to be discussed at.  Nobody, including myself, is making any personal attacks against Opie and Anthony.  And I'm the one running the board.  I did not say anything negative about them.  In fact, I think I've been a supporter of Opie and Anthony.  And I think they have acknowledged such over the air that my personal position with respect to them has been a reasonable one. 
[44:30]
 What I did say recently, and I will stand by, is that I thought that they should be doing Morning Drive on WNEW.  And I believe they should be.  I'm not saying that as a personal criticism of them or their listeners.  That's not a knock, and I don't understand why it's being taken that way.  From a radio programming point of view, a radio programmer is like somebody who has a hand of cards.  And you want to manipulate those cards as if it were a game of poker. 
[45:00]
 You want to use them in such a way that your hand is the strongest.  You don't have a personal love for the Jack of Hearts versus the Jack of Spades.  Your interest is taking those cards, putting them together in such a way that you'll win.  That's what this is all about with radio programming.  I'm not knocking Opie and Anthony.  I'm only pointing out that it is obviously, at the moment, WNEW's most successful show. 
[45:30]
 The most important day part in radio is Morning Drive.  Therefore, it seems to me that the most successful show should be in the most important day part.  And that is my whole argument.  I understand that they apparently don't want to do Morning Drive.  I understand that they would like to have a syndicated deal.  I understand all those things.  But if I was a program director of WNEW, I would put them on in Morning Drive,  because that would be the best thing for my radio station. 
[46:00]
 I'm not attacking Opie and Anthony.  If anything, I'm giving them a compliment.  I'm saying they are so good, they ought to be in ultra prime time,  as opposed to just prime time, which is what I would consider PM for.  And further, if they were on in the mornings,  WNEW could bring in somebody else in Afternoon Drive  and try and develop another personality or personalities for the radio station,  which they desperately need to do. 
[46:30]
 If they bring in somebody else new in the morning,  they're going to have a very difficult time because it is so competitive.  Break in a new voice in a high-profile slot in the afternoons,  and they will have a better chance of succeeding.  And if all of that works, if all of that works, WNEW is much better off.  Now, I understand the Howard Stern argument.  Why would Infinity want to put Opie and Anthony up against Howard Stern?  Because Howard might get damaged, and why would Infinity want to do that? 
[47:00]
 Okay, that's a legitimate argument.  I understand that.  It would be a gamble.  There's no question putting Opie and Anthony on in the morning.  But in my opinion, for whatever that's worth, and it's just my opinion,  Howard Stern would do just fine.  A lot of people have competed against Howard Stern.  John DeBello in Philadelphia, Man Cow in Chicago, et cetera, et cetera.  Howard Stern always does well.  Could he lose a little bit of audience from a direct competitor? 
[47:30]
 Yeah, he could.  But the guy's getting around an 8 to a 9 share in New York right now.  Let's say he drops a share, maybe even a share and a half.  He's still going to be the number one show.  And a WNEW can go from a .4 or .5, whatever their horrible morning ratings are right now.  If they can go from that to a 2.5, if they can do that,  they will be much better off, even if Stern loses a little bit.  Because I don't think Opie and Anthony are going to draw just from Stern.  They're going to draw from other radio stations. 
[48:00]
 So it seems to me there's a good possibility that they could do well in the morning,  and Stern would still do well in the morning.  Under those circumstances, Infinity comes out way ahead.  They've still got Stern, and now they've got a successful franchise at 102.7.  Doesn't that make sense?  Now you can disagree with me, but I think there is a logic to it.  After all of the discussion and those arguments that I have made on the board,  apparently Opie and Anthony decided yesterday 
[48:30]
 that they were going to encourage their fans to come on the New York radio message board  and just post crap, which is what went on yesterday afternoon.  And you know what?  I don't know what was gained by that exactly.  Obviously I can block them, I can delete the posts, I can do all of that stuff.  But I'm not sure what was being gained here.  Those who want to defend or argue for Opie and Anthony,  I encourage you to come on the board.  Believe me, I don't want to be the only one expressing my opinion here. 
[49:00]
 That's boring. That's no fun.  But come on and debate the issue.  What is it that I or somebody else has said on the board that you disagree with?  Don't come on there and say, oh, you're all a bunch of DJ wannabes,  or you're jealous, or whatever.  That's the same crap that Stern's fans spew out when somebody criticizes Howard.  And that's a bunch of nonsense.  Argue the point.  If you disagree with something I or somebody else have said,  then take what it is they say and argue with it. 
[49:30]
 That's what debate is all about.  That's what makes it interesting.  Personal attacks under false names that say nothing only drag the entire forum down  and force me to delete the posts.  I am not out to get Opie and Anthony.  I think they will tell you that.  Never mind what I say.  Ask them because they read the board and they know what I've been saying  for the past year and a half about their show.  If you've got a criticism or a disagreement, then argue it on that level. 
[50:00]
 If you're going to come on and just trash the board,  I'm going to delete your posts and I'm going to block it.  That sound effect is killing people.  I know it is.  Some people really have a problem with that drill.  My favorite is the spit. 
[50:30]
 So there you go.  Just making people talk all over the damn city, Anthony.  Sandy from Manhattan.  Okay, enough with the dentist spit.  I'm getting a cavity just listening to you.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm getting a cavity just listening.  This makes me sick.  Alan sniffing the dentist.  Where the hell is that train?  We got the train.  The train hit Alan.  Poor Alan. 
[51:00]
 Shut this guy up.  Stop, stop, stop.  Wow.  But that's what goes on on a regular basis on the New York Radio message board.  Yeah.  All these armchair quarterbacks.  Figuring it out from the other side of the mic.  Right.  They don't have a show to do here in New York, so they critique the other ones.  Correct.  Wonderful.  All right.  What are you trying to cue up?  The last part is really funny.  The last part of Alan's thing?  Really?  You sure? 
[51:30]
 Oh.  He talks about himself and everything.  About being a dentist?  Okay.  When I was in dental school.  He was talking about how he's going to be back on the radio.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah?  We should give them a show here at NEW.  They should.  Couldn't do any worse than half the shows around here.  We already do.  It's called Tomline.  Hello, I'm Alan.  I'm having a problem with my molar.  I got like this impacted... 
[52:00]
 Ow!  Ow!  Oh, that's what I'm like.  I want to know what to do.  Wow.  Hit it with a yield law.  Right from there?  Yeah, from like that.  All right.  Try that.  Polarizing radio station.  Whether you love WNAW or hate it right now, and we've got people who feel both ways on  the New York radio message board.  The fact is that it is a polarizing radio station.  Is it talk?  You can't ignore it. 
[52:30]
 Is that true?  It's true at least some of the time in terms of radio people.  Whether or not that's going to translate into overall ratings and so forth to the station,  we'll see.  I've argued before, and I will again.  I think this radio station is going to succeed.  I think it's going to appeal to the right demographics, and it's going to do well.  It's never going to be number one, I don't think, but I think it is going to get good  ratings with men 18 to 30, 18 to 35, something like that.  That's a desirable demographic for advertisers.  That means they will be able to sell the station and make money. 
[53:00]
 And folks, that's what this is all about.  And I think WNAW can succeed in doing it.  I don't think they're there yet, but I think they're on their way.  So I am not a hater of the radio station.  So when you attack me personally on the board, you're attacking the wrong guy.  All right.  With that, this is Alan Smith, and thank you for your time this time until next time.  Hey, who used to say that?  Thank you for your time this time until next time. 
[53:30]
 Roger Grimsby, I think.  Yeah, I think you might be right.  Is it Roger Grimsby?  Hey, hey, Alan, you're on the wrong guy.  Hey, hey, Alan, you're ripping off Roger Grimsby, the late Roger Grimsby, Mr.  Liver Spot himself.  All right.  There goes our pal, the rock and roll dentist, Alan Smith.  All right.  You got to love him.  Enough on that topic.  We'll move on to other things in just a bit.  Mario, I just canceled my dentist appointment.  Sound effects are killing me.  Stop. 
[54:00]
 I'm going to the dentist tomorrow.  People are freaking out.  They can't handle the sound effects.  People hate the dentist, man.  Of course.  Andrew.  Yo, turn that crap off.  It's killing me, guys.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks.  Have a good one, guys.  Bye.  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  We'll be back.  All right.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Jack, can we get these illiterates off of the air, please?  Please, suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW. 
[54:30]
 All right.  This is 1027 WNEW.  Mixing up the crap today, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Throwing it all over the place.  Hell, yeah.  The ONA Show.  If you got something, 212-757-1027.  Our fax line, 212-957-9639.  Why are you chuckling over there, Anthony?  Well, I just went to the WNEW.com website,  and indeed, your pictures are on the website. 
[55:00]
 You, looking through the giant pumpkin,  and you, pulling the little red wagon through the giant pumpkin field.  Now, where are these pictures?  Go to our little section where it says,  Opie and Anthony, you click on that.  All right.  And then right under our baby pictures,  it says, New Embarrassing Photos Number 2,  Opie the Pumpkin King.  Oh.  Let me see.  Oh, yeah, how to refresh.  Sometimes you've got to refresh your web page, Anthony. 
[55:30]
 Oh, of course.  A little refresh.  Oh, god damn.  There it is, the famous picture.  Look at all the other guys are there, girls.  Oh.  The second picture, you can see it on my face.  Why am I here?  Got to admit.  Please admit that part of it.  Yeah, you look like you really don't want to be there.  All right.  Got to admit.  I'm sure they'll be on the unofficial website by tonight, Anthony.  Yes.  Speaking of the unofficial, 
[56:00]
 Opie and Anthony website, there is a very, very funny little video clip,  I guess, almost a video clip.  It's like an animation.  Animation, sure.  Of Spaz and Ricky Martin on a jet ski.  It is so damn funny, man.  You got to see this thing.  The guy's got the big Spaz head, and Ricky Martin's on the back of the jet ski.  And they almost look like he's humping him as the jet ski goes.  Yeah, on the back of the jet ski.  And they almost look like he's humping him as the jet ski drives over the waves. 
[56:30]
 Yeah, and Ricky Martin's holding onto Spaz.  It's very, very creative and very funny.  I think that's the same guy that's done a bunch of other animations for the radio show.  Yeah.  Spaz doing the tomato and a couple others.  I got to see this thing again.  I'm popping it up right now, Spaz and Ricky Martin.  Foundrymusic.com.  Yeah, the guy calls himself the red pencil, I guess.  The red pencil.  Let me see, turn it around.  It's too funny, man. 
[57:00]
 Spaz's face going like a mile an hour.  Ricky Martin on the back.  You're going to laugh when you see that one.  www.foundrymusic.com, Anthony.  Very good.  All right, we're wasting so much time that we've got to take another break.  But before we do, we're going to play the They Call My Name's Bill.  Oh, boy.  Lost in a phone booth trying to find his way home, Anthony.  Okay?  At 4 o'clock, Jeffrey Ross comes in.  He's playing Caroline tonight.  Very funny man.  King of the one-liners. 
[57:30]
 And at 5 o'clock, we're all patiently waiting for his greatness to walk through our studio  door, The Rock.  The great one.  It's going two on one.  It's a handicap match.  Yeah, we've got a handicap match with The Rock at 5 o'clock.  All right, let's play this and we'll be back.  I'll send it first.  You know, I had this number in my wallet.  I don't know where I am.  You don't know where you are? 
[58:00]
 I had this number in my wallet.  You lost?  I don't know.  I'm in a phone booth.  Give me the phone number.  It's not on here.  There's no phone number on the phone?  Let me look.  What phone?  You're calling from a phone.  Is there a phone number there?  Yes, there is.  Could I have the phone number?  I believe it's the 8.  Hold on the phone.  Can you hold on?  Don't hang up.  Hello?  Yes, can you hear me?  Who's this?  This is a cell.  Can you hear me?  Hello?  Don't hang the phone up. 
[58:30]
 Hang up?  No, do not hang up.  Hold on, please.  Don't hang up.  I'm going to put you on the phone with someone else.  Hold on.  Hang up what?  No.  It's cold.  You're cold?  I'm colder, yes.  I know.  Cold like Brazil.  I believe I need a change.  Stay on the phone.  I'm wet.  You're all wet?  Yes, I'm wet.  Okay.  Would you just stay on the phone?  I need a change and my nurse isn't here.  I'm going to walk across the street now. 
[59:00]
 Who's this now?  My name is Judy.  What's yours?  I call my name's Bill.  Hi, Bill.  How are you?  Hi, Sam.  You sound a little lost.  I'm going to walk across the street now.  You know what?  I'd rather you didn't walk across the street because if you walk across the street, I can't  talk to you.  Hey, Bill.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Are you still there?  Who is this, please?  This is Judy.  Is this Bill? 
[59:30]
 Where's Sam?  Sam just went out to get some coffee.  I hate coffee.  Sam knows I hate coffee.  Well, maybe he went to get you a coffee and he said he was going out to get a drink.  There's cars now, a lot of cars.  I'm going to cross the street now.  You know what?  If there are a lot of cars, you shouldn't be crossing the street.  Here I go.  I can't talk to you.  I think my home is across the street.  Here I go.  Are you talking on the phone, Bill? 
[60:00]
 Hello.  Hello.  Oh, we should have called the police while we had him.  Wasn't he doing good?  He's still here.  He's good.  He probably was pissed off.  He did not hang up.  He put the phone down on the wall.  He dropped his phone.  He did not hang up.  Oh my God, someone call an ambulance.  I told you.  This is horrible.  My God, he looks awful.  Who is this?  Who am I speaking to, please?  Somebody call an ambulance.  The man got hit. 
[60:30]
 We're calling an ambulance.  Can you give me the address?  He's a mess.  The man got hit.  Someone call an ambulance.  Don't touch him.  Leave him down there.  Hello, can you give me, tell me where he is?  It's too late.  It's too late.  There's this bad spirit all over the road.  Can you tell me where you are?  It's too late.  Unless you got a shovel.  I will get a shovel.  Where are you?  It's too late.  It isn't too late.  It's too late.  What do you mean it's not too late?  It's over there in his hot tub.  Can't help you if you won't tell us where you are. 
[61:00]
 You can't help anymore.  Just bring a shovel.  Can you tell me where you are right now?  Disneyland.  In Disneyland?  Can you tell me where in Disneyland?  Higher to the top of the hill.  Can you tell me where you are?  We're going to the top of the hill.  Where are you?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Where in Disneyland?  Higher to the Caribbean. 
[61:30]
 And the Pirates of the Caribbean.  Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me.  I'm okay now.  You're okay?  You got all pulled yourself together again?  A car hit me and I feel fine now.  Oh, I'm so glad you feel fine.  You had me really worried.  That's all Bill needed was a little bumper.  Can you tell me where you are Bill?  Jupiter.  Now I'm Jupiter.  Planet Jupiter.  Is there a street number or a name on Planet Jupiter?  23 Jupiter. 
[62:00]
 23 Jupiter.  23.  Okay, do you live there?  Send a cab.  I would happily send a cab but you tell me where to send it.  They're telling to make a right at Venus.  Right at Venus.  And it's Jupiter, 28 Jupiter.  28?  That's what I said.  Okay.  And what are you doing there now?  Masturbating.  Masturbating.  Oh, I see. 
[62:30]
 Opie and Anthony.  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with?  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  This is 1027 WNEW.  On the way.  We have to play it one last time.  Drown, Cuban Drown.  The little kid going back.  Elian Gonzalez.  See all the protesting going on in Miami?  Yeah.  CNN had some live footage going on.  They're all protesting over the little boy.  Poor kid, gotta go back to Cuba.  Right.  Cuba. 
[63:00]
 And start rolling some cigars.  Some cigars instead of going to school here in the States.  Could be his last day in class.  They showed a little picture on the daily news.  Being walked to school.  It's just not fair.  You give him a taste of freedom like that and now you throw him back into that world over there in Cuba.  He was here during Christmas.  He got a bunch of cool presents and everything.  A bunch?  He got like thousands of gifts.  Everyone from all over the country was sending this kid a gift. 
[63:30]
 Next Christmas he'll be in Cuba and he'll be like, hey, what do I get?  Oh, a cigar and a bottle of rum.  Gee, thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Where's my big wheel?  He's going to grow up to be a bitter man, huh?  He'll be back on the inner tube.  I think once he gets a little older.  Probably pitching for the Yankees in another 10 years, right?  He ought to start warming up.  All right.  So we'll play Drown Cuban Drown, getting a lot of requests for that.  Also for the faithful listeners that hung through the commercials, Anthony. 
[64:00]
 Yes.  Let's give away some wrestling tickets.  We do have The Rock coming in at 5 o'clock.  And right now if you're the 10th caller at 212-757-1027, you're going to win a pair of tickets to see the WWF at the Continental Arena, January 16th.  Tickets, by the way, for this event are still available through Ticketmaster, but the 10th caller gets a freebie pair.  All right?  Aye.  Quick musical break right into Drown Cuban Drown.  If you haven't heard that, stick around.  It's coming very, very soon.  Drown, drown, Cuban Drown, Drown Cuban Drown, yeah, Cuban Drown, Drown, Drown Cuban Drown. 
[64:30]
 Turn around, oh, how you all drown.  Cuban on your way, USA.  Let's hear it for the refugees, give them a hand.  Broke the days just to open up a taco stand.  Twenty cubits broke on a wine bottle cork. 
[65:00]
 Guantanamo Bay is just a five-minute walk.  Turn around, oh, how you all drown.  Cuban refugees, from Miami Beach.  Because all you really need is a day away.  Remember Ricky Ricardo, Babaluay.  Look at Mama Peeta, she's as big as a boat. 
[65:30]
 You'd shove a motor up her ass if you thought she'd float.  Turn around, oh, how you all drown.  Cuban refugees, from Miami Beach.  Because all you really need is a day away.  Remember Ricky Ricardo, Babaluay.  Because all you really need is a day away.  Remember Ricky Ricardo, Babaluay.  Down, down, down, down, give it down. 
[66:00]
 Give it down, down, down, down, give it down.  Give it down, down, down, down, give it down.  Give it down, down, down, down, give it down.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of punks.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  Better leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opium Anthony Shoe. 
[66:30]
 1027 WNEW.  We're all getting a little nervous.  The Rock is coming in here.  I'm just getting a little nervous because he was on MSNBC.  And he was just being Dwayne.  People say he's just Dwayne.  You know, he's being Dwayne, not The Rock.  We want The Rock.  We want The Rock.  We want The Rock.  Like, what does it eat?  He's got two distinct personalities, Dwayne and The Rock. 
[67:00]
 Well, a lot of these guys look at it as a role they play.  But in the eyes of like you and I and a lot of the WWF fans, oh, no, he's The Rock.  He's The Rock.  He takes it dumb as The Rock.  He eats like The Rock.  I mean, yeah.  He apps like The Rock.  That'd be The Rock.  He's like a superhero, Anthony.  Like when you went to see, you know, you heard Batman was going to be appearing at the mall.  Wasn't the guy that played Batman.  You know, it was Batman.  Yeah, you were fully expecting, you know, the whole deal. 
[67:30]
 Yeah.  So we're praying because it's just like Dwayne.  There's gonna be like pulling teeth and you guys are gonna hear like really bad interviewing.  It's like, so my book.  So like, so did you like get into wrestling like a long time ago and stuff?  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  So my father and grandfather were in it.  Three generations of wrestling.  All right.  We're gonna take a lot of phone calls when he's in here.  Yeah.  You hear him not be in The Rock.  You guys know what to do.  OK. 
[68:00]
 Yes.  Our faithful listeners will know what to do.  We are far too big a pussies.  I was just gonna say that we really are.  We see we're brave.  We'll admit it.  Yeah, we sound brave.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We trash a lot of people and stuff, but if they're right in front of our face, we are  That's where we need your help, especially The Rock.  Right.  That's huge.  It's as big as these ceilings.  Oh, I am on The Rock.  If you smell what The Rock is cooking.  Well, we're a little nervous because we really like mankind, too, from the WWF. 
[68:30]
 Yeah.  And we had him on the air to promote his book.  And we actually had a chance to have him in studio a second time.  And the first interview on the phone was so bad and so painful.  Yeah.  We decided not to be mankind.  He was Nick Foley.  And we even tried to get him into the mankind character and stuff.  Yeah.  He couldn't be bothered.  So we had a pass on like actually getting to meet him and having him in studio.  Chris Jericho.  He was in character on the phone. 
[69:00]
 Brilliant.  Probably one of the best interviews we've had with a wrestler.  Guy was hysterical.  We were ragging him.  He was ragging us.  Right.  Very funny in character.  See, these guys got to understand to us, they're like bigger than life.  They're superheroes.  We don't want to see the face behind the curtain there.  Can't be Dwayne.  He's got to be The Rock.  He's got to be The Rock.  Donald, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Real good.  Every show I've seen him on or even heard him on on the radio, he's always been Dwayne. 
[69:30]
 I know.  He's been truly lame.  Oh, no.  Dead-ass lame.  Sorry, I've seen the curse.  That's not a curse.  You can say ass, ass, ass, ass.  Cool.  You just can't say the big ones.  Also, my mother goes crazy over this guy.  40-old black woman is rolling over this guy.  I'm like, what the hell?  Well, pretty much every woman here at WNEW wants to do The Rock.  Please.  They all can't wait.  They can do The Pebble. 
[70:00]
 That's me.  They're all in the bathrooms right now.  Getting all ready, getting the makeup on and fluffing up the hair and lubing up, taking  their dumps and stuff.  Getting ready.  All right, Donald.  Thanks a lot, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Jamie, what's going on?  Hey, The Rock with the MFNBC.  I work there.  Yeah.  He's the nicest, sweetest guy.  Oh, cool.  You guys should definitely not mess with him.  He's so sweet.  We don't want the nice, sweet Rock.  Oh, come on.  He is like the sweetest. 
[70:30]
 We want the pompous Rock.  You have never seen so many people go so crazy at our studios.  It was insane.  Well, I want him to put fear in my eyes.  I want him to make me believe that he is going to take the people's elbow to my forehead  and give me the rock bottom, kick your arms into position and the people's elbow.  I don't think that's possible.  He is like the nicest guy.  I can't even believe that he could be mean.  He's so sweet.  No, we don't want him.  We just want him to be kind of in character.  That's all. 
[71:00]
 I know.  We'll have fun with him either way.  We understand, but we're just praying that he's the Rock.  Yeah.  He comes in and calls us jabronis and stuff.  Call me a jabroni.  I mean, a lot of people asked for his autograph and asked if he would write that kind of stuff  and he did.  He was really cool about it.  All right, Jamie.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  I'm hoping he comes in here and goes, which is which?  And I go, well, Rock, my name is...  It doesn't matter which is which.  Yeah, we need the Rock.  I want him to walk in the door and say, I want him to walk in the door and say, I want 
[71:30]
 you to come.  We need the Rock.  Yeah, we need the Rock.  I want him to walk in that door with the sunglasses on and tilt his head up toward the ceiling.  The People's Eyebrow, give a little sniff, know that we have millions and millions of  listeners.  I want him to say, finally, the Rock has come back to the Opien Anthony Show, even though  show even though this is his first appearance. Right, but who cares?  Scott, what's going on? What's up, man? 
[72:00]
 All right, know your damn role. What do you think? Are you going to come out  like a fish or what? I don't know. It's so weird. It's like having  a schizophrenic on the air. You don't know what personality you're going to get. We  have to do an interview and we don't know what personality we're getting. It's  like two totally different people are coming in. If he's the way and I'm  calling back. Yeah, we want you guys to call back and try to encourage him to be 
[72:30]
 the rock because we're gonna have a tough time doing it. All right. You guys  are back. No, we're not. Thank you. You guys are back. He has been the rock on  shows. Yeah. What? Joe, what's going on? Hey, what's up? All right. First of all, you better  hope that he ain't good friends with China. Why? Because he'll want to kick your ass.  I never said anything bad about China. But besides that, I've seen him act as the rock 
[73:00]
 on Channel 9 in a news interview on TV. Right. I saw that too. He was kind of like...  His eyebrows were more famous than Jack Nicholson. He was rock light.  Rock light. Well, he was. He was like kind of the rock but a little more  conservative. We want him to just like come in here and be just belligerent.  I met the rock and he was in character. This is encouraging. Sean, turn down your  radio. All right. What do you got, Sean? Sean is listening to the radio. Sean, is 
[73:30]
 that your name? Did Spaz type it wrong? Steve? Steve? Scott. Bill? Stan? Bob.  Ryan. Ed. Sean! What an ass. I hope you guys could appreciate what happens in this  radio show at times, okay? A lot of you guys have car phones, okay? Just picture  how stupid some of our listeners are. God, we love you guys, but you're a stupid  some of you. Just picture this. You're in your car. You decide, I am going to call 
[74:00]
 the Opie and Anthony show. I met the rock and I have something to tell the boys.  Right. Right? You dial up the O&A show. Spaz butchered through. Hold on. Turn down  your radio. They are going to be with you shortly. So now you have the phone to  your ear. We pick up. So now you can hear us saying, Hello, Sean, what do you have  for the show? But he's listening to the radio. Which is 40 seconds behind 
[74:30]
 because we're in delay. So he is ignoring the voice that is live nationwide in his  ear and waiting for us to say hi through the radio. Through the radio.  Brilliant. Oh, and it happens all the time.  Unreal.  I'll call the wrong one. What happened to Jeffrey Ross? He was supposed to be  here already. Uh, Jose. Yeah, what's going on? How you doing? Greg. I met this guy 
[75:00]
 one time down in Seacock. The rock. He's the most arrogant bastard I've ever met.  That's what we want to say. It's the truth. I swear. He is so arrogant. I  walked up to him and he was getting an autograph from my two year old son. The  dude just blew me off. I was like, dude, you stink. That's what we want to say.  He's the worst. The nicest guy in the Federation there, believe it or not,  Triple H. That guy's great. All right. He blew us off. But the rock, he blows  monkey. All right. Thanks. All right, Chief. We want the arrogant rock. Yes. We 
[75:30]
 want to be dissed. We want to yell that to Brony. We're willing to play. I hope  he is. I guess we'll see. I want him to say something about the microphone. Oh,  turn it up. Shine it up real nice. The microphones we have in front of us. Just  saying I want him to say something about the microphone. I'm gonna say his lines,  but they'll be all like, you know, turn it sideways and stick it in your candy  ass. Right. Hey, Mike, you're next. What's going on? Hey, what's going on?  When I just the guy in the army again. All right. I got a question. Why are these 
[76:00]
 people that are on hold so stupid? They don't realize the radio is on through  the phone as well when they're on hold. I don't understand it. Well, because it's  two different things. You got the delay working on your radio and then on the  phone. It's exactly what's happening live in the studio. As soon as fast as  what you name hold on, you hear you guys on the phone anyway. So why bother  listening to the radio? And if you are on hold for the radio show, that is us  live before delay. You get exactly you get to hear all the uncensored crap.  You get to hear all the curses and everything else. So I don't understand 
[76:30]
 why people continue to wait for us to say hi through the radio when they got  the phone to their ear. It boggles the mind. Mike, thank you. Have a good one.  All right. You too. Bye.  Everyone is just very excited around saying we should hold the rock down and  shave off his eyebrows. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that'll happen. How are we going to hold  the rock down? Yeah. Tom, you're next. What's going on? Yeah, I want to know if 
[77:00]
 you're going to do Fight Club with the rock so he can put his crotch on your  face. I know that will not be happening. I'm going to encourage the rock to beat  the crap out of Rick today, though. Oh, good. Even better. I am encouraging that  you guys don't forget anything. All right. Thank you. Bye. All right. Bob,  you're next. I got a short part with you guys. Get the rocky character. All right. 
[77:30]
 When he comes in, that's what we're doing. We thought that it doesn't matter  how you're doing. That's not a bad idea. A short part way to do it. All right,  man. You think or he'll just go like, That's funny. That's funny. By the way,  my new book is available. Thank you, bro. Thanks a lot. Bye. And you know,  as we sit here and patiently wait for the rock, Jeffrey Ross also make an  appearance today. Yeah, a return appearance. I have to say, I think Bill  Parcells is the most brilliant mind on my football today. Genius. This guy, 
[78:00]
 he's an absolute genius. He's calculating like Michael Corleone. This  guy, I am amazing at this point in time. I truly believe he had. He was never  going to quit coaching. No.  Have you been following this story? It's amazing. Yeah. Okay. So he knew  everything that was going to happen. Bill Belichick, the assistant. Yeah,  he's pretty much the number one candidate for all the head coaching jobs 
[78:30]
 in the NFL as we speak. Yes. Mostly the Patriots one. Okay. Now, if he was a  head coach because he's under contract, no other team in the NFL could talk to  Bill Belichick and hire him away. But there's a rule in the NFL. If you are  an assistant coach, you are allowed to talk to other teams to be a head coach.  Right. So Bill Parcells, knowing that he's probably going to lose his right  hand man anyway after the season because there was some grumblings in the  background and stuff. Bill Belichick wasn't completely happy is what I'm 
[79:00]
 starting to hear. Right. Bill Parcells quits as the head coach of the Jets,  making Bill Belichick the head coach now. Right. Which in turn means no one in the  NFL could talk to Bill Belichick. Right. Knowing that Bill Belichick would not go  for this, he will quit because he was so unhappy in the Jets organization. Okay.  Opening up the position. Thus opening up the position again. And now if the 
[79:30]
 Patriots want to hire Bill Belichick, they're going to have to give the Jets  draft choices, draft choices, little revenge for when Parcells came to New  York. I bow to him today. It's amazing. There's no doubt in my mind he makes an  announcement within what I guess we're waiting for the new owners to take no  owners who will probably hand over huge amounts of cash to Parcells. Right. To  once again take the helm of the Jets. He had no intention of leaving, of leaving.  I am doing what he was doing. It's one man's opinion, but I am completely 
[80:00]
 convinced of that. He's going to get draft picks and more money. Draft picks,  more money and, and the whole team and the whole city were rallying around him  because now he comes back as like the hero. I am here to save the team once  again. Brilliant move. I think he totally had it planned. I'm convinced of  it. Amazing. He's not a pussy.  He's a big, sticky smacker. I reckon he doesn't like him, I guess. It's all 
[80:30]
 business, pal. I understand. It's all business. I like what he says to, you  know, to the press. Things like, well, I'm in control for the time being. What  is he, Alexander Haig? Yeah. He says, I'm in control right now and that's all I  think you need to know. And they ask him more questions and he's like, well, I  just told you everything you need to know. He gets all belligerent, nasty and 
[81:00]
 stuff. Right. Parcells. He is just, I don't know how you, how the sports papers  interview this guy. He's just the nastiest son of a bitch. I love it about  him. I answered that question. Shut up. What are you stupid? Yeah. That is the  dumbest question I've ever heard. Next. Next. And you just like sit there. Just  pushes him aside and you're like, oh, I just got bashed by the tuna. I thought I  was good at what I did with this reporting stuff. So he comes back to the 
[81:30]
 Jets with probably draft picks and more money. John, what's going on? I don't  know. How do you feel about the Pete Carroll thing? Pete Carroll? What? He can  be the coach of the Jets.  He aftered up one time already. Enough of that guy. We had enough of him. I'm  bummed that the Patriots didn't keep him. He is the worst. Thanks. Bye. All  right, John. Hey, just waiting for the rock. Figured I would ask a question 
[82:00]
 while I wait for the rock today. Hey, mom, can I listen to the Opie and Anthony  show today? They're going to have the rock on. They're not going to do the  lesbian stuff today. I could listen, right? Right. Yeah. I wonder if kids have  to ask permission. They hear the rock and it's like, can I listen to the  Jets today just for a little while because the rock is going to be on. I'll  turn it right off. I think a lot of them are sneaking like under the bed with  the radio right now. Sneak your radio out. Mom, they're not doing egg 
[82:30]
 shooting today. They're going to have the rock on. Can I listen for a little  while? My homework is done.  Zeke from Manhattan saying, if you guys interview Tom Hanks, do you want to talk  to Forrest Gump? Come on, get behind the scenes or goof around with him. No,  actually, we would want Forrest Gump. Yeah, that would be much more fun than Tom  Hanks. All right. I see Jeffrey Ross in the wings. Let's get him on the radio 
[83:00]
 next. Okay. All right. Quick break. We'll be back. The Opie and Anthony show.  Okay, terrific.  Hey, Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. Oh, yeah. You remember  our good friend Stacker. They were here with us during the summer and then I  guess they laid off a while, but they're back, Opie. They were here during  the dark years of the Opie and Anthony show. Yes, very grim. Or the dark months,  I should say. The dark months that seemed like years. But they're back after 
[83:30]
 the holidays. Everyone pigged out, you know. You all had the big dinners with  your family and you plumped up a bit and the coats are covering them up. Okay.  But, you know, springs right around the corner. You better start losing weight  now. And Stacker 2 is the world's strongest fat burn. That's right. What  else does it do, Opie? Do you remember the other two things? Yes, I've been  studying very hard, Anthony. Okay. It burns the fat because it is the world's  strongest fat burner. Yes. It's your boost of energy. Yes. And it also cuts 
[84:00]
 the cravings to eat in between meals. Very good. That's where you gain a lot of  weight when you have a nice snack and your fellow employees desk and they got  like the little kisses or cookies or something rolling around there. So a  coconut hostess snowball. How could you pass that up? Oh, with a gooey  marshmallow-y coating. Check out Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner at  www.stacker2.com. That's stacker2.com or give them a call at 1-800-LIGHTLINE. 
[84:30]
 That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Thousands have proven it works.  1027-W-N-A-W. It's Opie. It's Anthony. And entering the studio in just a minute  here, Jeffrey Ross, the very funny and talented Jeffrey Ross Anthony. Yes. John,  what's going on? Hey, you guys, I'm watching TV live. That kid, Elio  Gonzalez, he's got a lot of bills in his hand. He's got gold chains around his 
[85:00]
 neck and he's sitting on his uncle's shoulders. Are you serious? I mean, the  guy had an electric Benz the other day. Yeah, a little electric Mercedes Benz he  got for Christmas. I mean, my God, I was born in America and when I was nine or  however old he is, I didn't get squat. So he's on TV with a lot of bills right  now. Yeah, I was part kid on his uncle's shoulders holding a rolled up lot of  like fives. He's going to be so disappointed next Christmas. Jeffrey Ross 
[85:30]
 and this Christmas in the U.S. with a bunch of sympathetic groups and all kinds  of gifts. Right. Well, thank you, John. Oh, you got there.  Oh, Seagulls, Cuban Seagulls fresh off the plane, buddies. Oh, Jeffrey Ross in  the studio. Wait, you were just in Cuba this morning. Are you serious? I got in  at three in the morning. Really? What were you doing there? I went across the  country for getting him cans at work. I drove across the country. It was mind 
[86:00]
 boggling. I'm you're one of the first two people I've spoke to in English and  eight, 20 days. I woke up and came here. Awesome. Yeah. What the hell is it? Yeah,  look, he's got a Cuban shirt on. You wouldn't believe what was going on there  and there with this thing. Now, how the hell did you get there? I don't want to  talk about that specifically, but I always get an illegal. I got in. You  know, something is illegal. Is that easy to get there? What do you got to go to  from Canada or something? I went to Mexico. Mexico. Yeah, but that's good 
[86:30]
 with a big plane load of cocaine. It was one of the coolest experiences of my  life. Look at you. You look like he looks like he's had some kind of religious  experience like he's been part of a coup or something. Look at us. He's just all  happy and growing a Castro type beard. He's wearing military fatigue. Wow, look  at this. There's a T shirt with a kid on it. We wouldn't believe that. That's  Raph Boy. Yeah, yeah, Raph. I only heard coming up here because I just woke up 
[87:00]
 that he's going home. Yeah, they're sending him back. That's today. That just  happened. Yeah, pretty much. What'd you see? I get my news from you guys. Yeah,  I know. Opium Anthony, your source for news. Let me tell you something. That's  I haven't heard the news in a week because it doesn't happen there. You know,  they have their news in Cuba is seven hours long and they only have two  stations and it's just they don't show like a story. It's one story event.  Yeah, really? They'll have a protest, a rally for the kid. And that's the whole 
[87:30]
 day's television. Show it in real time. I'm sad blows. Come on. He's out in  real time. Yeah, it's unbelievable. That's the OJ chase. Only not as fun.  Now, what's going on down there? I mean, what were you doing? Yeah, you got to  tell us, you know, I'm a comedian, so you have to have some life experience.  Yeah. So you figured going to Cuba, I took off. I a buddy of mine goes down  a lot and he has basically what has become family down there. Really  beautiful people on the other side of the country. They don't want to tell 
[88:00]
 what town it is. No, he's a preserve. Okay, free of medic on us. Look at this.  He's all of a sudden turns Cuban. I can't even think in America.  I got American customs and I went through and the guy says, have a nice day.  And I said, Gracia, I don't even I forgot how to speak English in eight days.  I didn't speak to anybody. He's been brainwashed. And I know he's starting  to believe in Fidel. It looks like I want to smoke one of those. Definitely. 
[88:30]
 Yeah, I don't have to smoke one here. We had Cubans down in Turks and Caicos.  We went down there to do a broadcast. Yeah, all the best cigars ever.  Yeah, I mean, I've become how do you get them out? Because we were in Turks and  Caicos. We were so freaking paranoid. A paranoid bring some home with you.  Think it was like Midnight Express. We have a tape to our bodies and we're  going to end up in a Turkish prison. I have I have ten coheedas up my ass.  All right, torture some stinkweed. I think one of them is lit. 
[89:00]
 I think the labels off so they're completely natural.  Oh, that's a good start. Joe, what's up? It's probably a good thing.  The Cuban kid, he's not going back. What do you mean?  Because it's a law here. If any Cuban touches base on US soil,  it's such a game. He's protected. He can't go back.  All the papers are saying he's going home. Him being a minor, though, that makes it a little.  The only loophole is maybe that he's a minor. And his father's over. 
[89:30]
 There's natural fathers in Cuba and he wants him back.  I mean, personally, I think he should go back because we should.  I mean, it's not like his father abused him or anything like that.  I'm looking at the paper and says US rules. Dad gets the kid.  He's going home to Cuba. Yeah, I don't think so.  I think they're going to deploy, but I don't think he's going.  All right. Well, we'll find out. We'll find out soon enough.  Thank you, Joe. Pretty impoverished down there.  They made a deal. Instead of Cuba, they're going to just let them live in Newark.  No, I want to go to Cuba. 
[90:00]
 Please give me my tin shack.  Now, this is I got this shirt.  That's amazing. It's, you know, it's easier.  There's no I drove across the country. My buddy, there's no there's no street signs and highway signs.  There's nothing. So if you want to get around, you need to pick people up.  The whole country hitchhikes. It's there's a lot of love.  The people love each other. People are very happy.  They don't have any transportation. All the cars are old American cars.  Soviet cars there from the fifties and forties.  But it's like a time capsule. 
[90:30]
 I can't even breathe from all the cigars.  And and we pick up this cop.  He wants to go out. He wants to go home for New Year's.  He's going to get across the country. He's hitchhiking with another.  You know, they don't have cars and the police, they don't they don't transport the police to work and back.  So he's going to hitchhike. It takes a couple of days to get home.  So we pick him up. And it's also sort of it makes it easier to get around because you have to stop for directions.  You know, you won't get jerked around. Right.  And my buddy had his girlfriend with him and they're not really supposed to be in the car together. 
[91:00]
 And so on. You follow. So we pick this cop up and he winds up.  He's all intimidating when he gets in. He's an 18 year old kid.  You know, he's a I had him watching my DVD player, you know, something about Mary on headphones, Spanish subtitles.  This is a kid who's never heard of Mickey Mouse. Oh, wow.  Cuban police. There's no Western culture at all.  I'm 10 hours from Havana. You understand?  I mean, you're way in the country and I'm asking him, I said, please, a T-shirt. 
[91:30]
 That's amazing. You could never get that. And what a great souvenir.  He's like, no, it's official. They can never give it away. This and that, this and that.  I offered to buy it. Nothing. It wouldn't.  You know, and they make seven dollars a month to police.  OK, that's like here at any W. We got the cops in New York.  They spend that on every day on coffee.  I would have said donuts, but it's just too hacky.  And finally, at the end of the trip, he gave it to me as a gift.  That's cool. And they're really very noble people. 
[92:00]
 That's like contraband having a copy of something about Mary.  Yeah. You know, down there.  He was on DVD. It was like literally he looked at it like he watched a lunar land.  I bet. That's like what is this?  You know, like crack.  Probably have like just the old movie project is like you had in school.  Yeah. It's like the medium.  It was so cool for him to see it.  I mean, the scene where Ben Stiller zips up is right.  And I was laughing so hard, you know, he's never seen a movie that's you know,  just no chance. That's why I'm close. 
[92:30]
 And there could be some real prime resort real estate down there.  If we ever open up some ties with them people again, it looks like it's like the  Catskills with chicks.  Buildings are all from the 50s. Yeah.  But yet they're kind of a little bit. And they're not. They're old.  I don't know how the women know the women are beautiful.  Yeah. And they're all it's Jennifer Lopez.  Whoa. Tony, what's up?  Hey, I got to say something here, man. Yeah, hit it.  I'm like set up with this stupid kid. 
[93:00]
 This is paper critical.  I want to sound like a white American.  They line the border to keep all these freaking aliens out.  They shoot them on sight.  Here's one kid. Oh, we don't want to give them back.  And the freaking guy back on the raft and be done with it.  I think they'll fly him back if they do send him back.  I don't think they'll just pop them on an inner tube and shove them off of Florida.  That could be pretty funny. Oh, my God.  It's like a track is progress on the Internet and stuff.  See if Raph Boyd makes it back to Cuba. 
[93:30]
 The paper view of the century.  Oh, not again. Absolutely would pay for that.  Hell, I'd buy. That would be a great little video game.  Try to get him back. Try to get Raph Boyd back to Cuba.  Bad man. So what else are you doing?  You're playing Caroline. I'm a Caroline's man tonight, tomorrow,  Saturday and Sunday. When did you get in?  I got in three o'clock in the morning.  I was slurring. Were you asleep at all?  Did you sleep? I slept a few hours.  I woke up. I showered. I got mosquito bites and rashes.  Well, look at you. 
[94:00]
 Pull your sleeve back. I just got home from driving across.  Dude, look at his look at his arm. Pull your sleeve back.  It just finally there are mosquito bites all over your arm.  To see my legs. I look like a leper from Papillon.  Man, it was unbelievable. He's warming up, baby.  It was so cool. I'm drinking some cappuccino here.  I'm waking up. You seem like the jungle you were in or something.  It was. I was in. No, literally, I was in the jungle.  You know, I got up to pigs and chickens.  I haven't sat in a toilet seat in eight days. 
[94:30]
 How do you take a dump? You just kind of squat wherever you want.  It's what nature calls. What about toilet paper?  Toilet paper is hard to come by, but luckily the people I stay with,  like a breakfast type of situation, I mean,  type of situation, not a bed and breakfast.  You know, you're waking up, you sleep four hours.  The people are so happy in such as New Year's festive.  There's music playing 24 hours a day around Cuba.  I don't care if you're in the biggest city or in the smallest little village.  Right. Happy people dancing. 
[95:00]
 Oh, those people love their music.  And and it's all like, you know, like, you know, the words beach and dance.  Right. Every song is about the beach and dances.  When they got the flyer, that's why I like to buy that, you know,  and this music all night.  So the roosters don't know if it's morning or night.  So the roosters are all night long.  So, you know, the country is like it's it's one big fiesta. 
[95:30]
 The party and Americans pretty well received.  Oh, my God. I thought I was Bruce Willis.  Well, really, Disney World was like you tell them you're American.  There's no resentment about what's going on politically or anything like that.  They're just warm, beautiful, giving very, you know, I mean, it's not a it's a third  world country, but the people are all clean.  Their houses are all immaculate. They don't live in.  And there is now a communist.  I just I'm about people.  I don't know. It was really cool. That sounds cool. 
[96:00]
 We don't I never thought like somebody would go to Cuba and actually have a good time.  I guess I've been, you know, just reading the line.  You know, I don't know.  I don't know anybody who's been there.  I saw a woman.  Her breasts were so big that she could have gotten to Florida with a man.  I started swimming.  She never drowned.  Flotation device.  Well, this experience affect all your one liners, Jeffrey, that you do at the Rose.  Are you going to be a happier person now?  They might. Yeah, I don't know. 
[96:30]
 I'll still be the mean bastard.  I am cynical.  You stole the show once again this year.  The last night.  We're not at that. We saw Jerry Stiller.  Yes, because you were in here promoting it way before.  Just before the tape.  I remember I wouldn't tell you the jokes before.  The Arthur joke.  Yeah, very funny.  But the Arthur's like a real shade on the air.  But God, I almost puked.  I was so hard.  So Sandra Bernhardt.  I wouldn't hire with the Arthur's slot.  And Sandra Bernhardt. 
[97:00]
 I was just like that was painful to watch.  Her Hebrew name is Yif.  That was just like pulling that big steel sweaty handle on a train.  And like the sparks are shooting out of the wheels.  Like everything's going cold.  People are funny and everything.  She comes up.  Just grinds to a halt.  You're watching. What the hell is she doing?  She sang. She sang a magic man.  Yeah, I thought she was. 
[97:30]
 It was funny because Jerry Stiller was dancing.  And his crotchety old body up there doing the hustle was so funny to me.  She probably thought she was the hysterical one in that.  Does she really think she's still funny?  I don't know her.  You know, she always, every year I do these roasts.  I haven't always been on TV.  So she knows what I do.  So she always splits before I go on.  Because she knows that she's in there.  She'd rather hear about it than hear it. 
[98:00]
 They don't want that reaction shot.  She doesn't want to give them that.  You know, that money shot.  I met Billy Crystal afterwards and he said to me,  the money should be Arthur after I said that.  He goes, and the look on what is now her face.  Very good.  We got to take a break.  Jeffrey Ross in studio.  He's playing Caroline's Thursday through Sunday.  God, you got shows all over.  I think you're doing like 20 shows between now and Sunday. 
[98:30]
 And all proceeds will be going to Cuba.  Shipping it all off to Cuba.  To buy some rafts for those fun people.  I'm not making that much money,  but it's enough to take care of a lot of people down there.  I bet you live like a king down there on a few bucks.  Yeah, but there's nothing to live.  There's no king.  There's no king.  What am I going to buy?  You get the better mud house.  The two room mud.  All right, stay there.  You're a sick ass man. 
[99:00]
 Anthony, you're not a jackass.  You're obviously a star.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It makes me sick.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, hang with Jeffrey Ross.  I guess he's like our new friend.  He's been in here a couple of times.  I like being in here, man.  Getting to know him a little bit, Anthony.  Yeah.  Just got back from Cuba.  Who the hell goes to Cuba?  It's amazing.  And I've never known anybody that goes there.  Really?  You must have just exhausted every other place on the globe 
[99:30]
 if you chose Cuba.  Well, it was between Maine and Cuba.  Maine, huh?  No.  You know, it's New Year's.  It's a millennium.  When am I going to do that?  Yeah.  It's very rare that I could just disappear nowhere.  So you spent New Year's, though?  Yeah, New Year's Eve.  I went to a party.  I went to a party, then I went to a disco.  The discotheque.  Let me tell you what this place is like.  The men's room attendant was a goat. 
[100:00]
 You throw your garbage on the floor and he eats.  I mean, you know, it's really, really in the middle of nowhere.  Third world.  10-hour drive from Havana, which isn't exactly Paris.  You know what I'm saying?  Beautiful city, beautiful people.  I was really out in the world.  I'm sure you didn't have to worry about the Y2K problem  down there.  They don't have computers yet, so I  think you were just fine down in Cuba, right?  I left on the 27th, so it was just  when Seattle decided they were kind of on maybe we will,  maybe we won't.  I was Y2K to death. 
[100:30]
 I just hearing it, hearing it, hearing it.  And I'm talking to this guy right in Havana,  and I go, I asked him about Y2K in my broken Spanish.  And he goes, no, no compendio, que es Y2K.  And I said, oh, god, I'm in the right place.  They didn't even know what I was talking about.  That's good.  Oh, come on.  Everything, it's so weird.  Can you imagine you go to every store,  you go to check in at the airport,  and you give them your locator number,  and they have to write it down and go check and see 
[101:00]
 if you have a reservation.  It's not all compendio.  Right.  Pressing buttons or anything.  They're looking through paper.  It's people doing work.  Something you don't see anymore.  You don't feel a little scared, though, at the airport.  The airport, you know, it's like the people, they can't rob you.  They can't rip you off.  They can't do that because, you know, if you sell meat,  you're not allowed to sell meat.  Really?  Beef.  Six years in jail. 
[101:30]
 Six years for selling meat.  You know what I'm saying?  So you know you're not going to get taken.  It can't happen.  Right.  There's a lot of people looking for a hustle and stuff like that,  help you find your way around or to find chicks and stuff like that.  They'll help you.  Plenty of chicks to buy?  Yeah.  Maybe, no.  There's a lot of beautiful women in Cuba.  I'm going to have to leave it at that because I'm on the radio.  God.  What did you eat? 
[102:00]
 The national dish of Cuba is a ham sandwich.  Without the ham.  You know, I ate, I seated with friends and way out in the boonies.  And the food was delicious.  We stayed with a great, she was a great cook.  And they make do.  And they really put together a nice shrimp.  And it's by the beach.  And you can really put something together.  But when you're on the road and the rest stops,  and they have this place called Rappidoz, they're like 7-Eleven. 
[102:30]
 But with like, they only have three things.  And they're the same place all over.  It's pizzas with ham on it.  They're frozen pizzas.  But they're basically mostly bread.  A little bit of sauce and cheese.  And they put some ham on it or you don't have ham on it.  Pollo, fried chicken, which has the texture of steak.  It's tough.  And make that two things.  All right. 
[103:00]
 John, what's going on?  How are you doing?  This is Joe.  Oh, Joe, you were in Cuba?  Yeah, I performed at Guantanamo Bay down in 88.  And down near the Marine Barricade,  there was this abandoned bank on the Cuban side.  And they would have workers come in.  They would strip search them, coming and going every day.  It was quite interesting.  All right.  Quite interesting watching guys getting stripped.  Well, you know, it was an interesting thing,  how they would go through. 
[103:30]
 But I tell you, it was very, very wild on the US side,  inside the base.  So if Jeffrey ever gets a chance to go back down there  and perform on the base, I highly recommend it.  The military women get awfully lonely down there.  Yeah, I bet.  All right.  All right, thanks, guys.  Well, thank you, John.  And that's what you want, the army broads.  Because they're the most attractive ones.  It's just like stripes.  You're going to see PJ Soles in a uniform.  Yeah.  Swear to God.  Who's your sergeant?  Jeff, you're next.  What's going on? 
[104:00]
 Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I was in Jamaica.  And they have flights that fly over to Cuba.  It takes 2 and 1 half hours.  And I don't know what part he was in.  But I landed, I think I landed in a marijuana field.  And you got guys with cigars and glasses,  just like the movies Carrie and Uzi.  And I don't know where he was.  And you know, dogs are eating dogs.  I mean, it was just, it just fucked me out.  Maybe you missed the island.  I don't know, but it did.  I think you were in Staten Island. 
[104:30]
 The only island that I could see.  Yeah, it's Staten Island.  Yeah.  That's all I wanted to say, guys.  Hey, what's that, a train?  No, no, you did all right.  No drugs down there.  All right, thanks.  People must be scared crapless.  You know, no, the people are very.  Yeah, there's no drugs because it's the end of your life.  Right.  Firing squad.  Really?  Yeah.  That's how they feel about drugs?  It's a communist dictatorship.  There's no drugs.  There's no, there's no, it's not happening.  Someone's got to be sneaking drugs somewhere in that country.  It's all about rum. 
[105:00]
 You know, they get rum.  It's everywhere, straight.  It's delicious.  It's like candy.  You know, it's full of sugar.  And they get, it's three hours a bottle.  Right.  And it's delicious.  They call it cuba libre.  Rum and Coke.  And it's like drinking a lollipop.  It's so good.  They put a lime in it.  Maybe that's where the crack is.  In the rum.  In the rum.  The rum and the beers are like, you know, they're really strong.  Yeah.  I'm borderline.  I'm like literally one Christmas party away from being a drunk, 
[105:30]
 I think.  That's what the commies like doing, keeping their population drunk.  Yeah, they were definitely partying.  You waking up there, Jeff?  I feel great.  You look tired.  Is that going to be all right today?  Yeah.  OK.  We're going to smoke these cigars?  Yeah.  You could light up one of the cigars.  Really?  Yeah, we don't have a boss today, right?  You want one?  Wow, it's going to puff in here.  Sure.  Let's roll a bunch.  Wow, this is incredible.  Smoking Cuban cigars, lime in the shell.  Why don't you go to the Port Authority?  Is that all right? 
[106:00]
 These aren't the, these are Amante Crystals.  These are great.  Oh, yes.  Those are the biggies.  Those are the ones we were smoking down there.  You can get one in.  I'll pass.  They say Habana on it.  Habana means Savannah.  Yes.  I don't have a cutter.  I'm trying to.  Uh-oh.  That could be a problem.  No, you bite it.  Come on.  People cigars.  He's got a little thing.  Yeah, this is cool.  I have a little cigar.  We'll celebrate the new year.  A little Cuban cigar.  And Jeffrey Ross is going to help us out  with the rock interview.  Rock's coming in in a little while. 
[106:30]
 He's a pussy.  Uh-oh.  I'm not wrong at that.  We're kind of concerned, because he's  got the rock character that he is on the WWF.  But the interviews we've seen him on, he's been Dwayne Johnson,  who he really is.  Because the rock on TV is like,  Like what Sable's doing?  Like what Sable does?  Yeah.  You know, the rock is kind of like, you know, hey,  I'm the rock.  And I'm the, you know, he's always  still talking about how great he is and everything.  And then he's on the interviews. 
[107:00]
 He's like, yeah, well, I'm buying my new book.  I'm Dwayne Johnson.  Dwayne Johnson, the rock.  You know, I should know what the rock's cooking.  He wants to act, probably.  You can't act as the rock.  It's easy.  Maybe that's it.  Oh, look at that.  We're distracted.  We got a razor blade.  What are we going to do?  Coke, too?  Jesus Christ.  No, we're going to cut these.  He's got like the blade.  Perfect.  Thanks.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I need a light, an ashtray, and a couple of broads.  And you're all set.  We got a bunch of little kids outside the studio. 
[107:30]
 Oh, my god.  Really?  You know what they call, they call,  we had a joke, you know, it's really fun for me  as a comedian to make people laugh who don't speak English.  It's like, who've never seen me.  What a challenge.  And the thing that got everyone cracking up  is I would call Ricky Martin, whenever he came on,  he would come on in Spanish and the disco and stuff.  He can't buy it, but they know what it is.  Right.  They think all pop music is the Backstreet Boys.  That's the ashtray.  And they think, I called him Ricky. 
[108:00]
 My buddy and I called him Ricky Marnie Cohn.  Ricky Marnie Cohn.  And they would crack as the funniest joke you could say.  A little late with the cigar cutter, but thanks.  I knew somebody was going to come down on one of us.  I'm going to light mine.  There goes Jeffrey Ross lighting up a big fat Cuban.  Fat Cuban.  Look at that.  We have authentic contraband right here in the studio. 
[108:30]
 What embargo?  I don't know what you're talking about.  Start chewing on that bad boy, man.  Look at him, man.  Puff away.  Thank you.  There you go.  Ah.  Ah.  Lucy, I'm home.  Hey, Fred.  Hey, what do you think?  Tastes good.  It matches.  You get the other side.  This place is going to be a.  That's all right. 
[109:00]
 You know, this is the last show of the day,  that broadcast from here, so.  I love the studio.  And what are you thinking, man?  Mm.  It's like a.  They're strong.  And you know what the best cigars are?  They have the local ones.  No, they have nothing written on them.  They're just rolled in these little towns.  Yeah.  You should have brought some of those home.  Oh, he probably did.  He's keeping those for himself. 
[109:30]
 He's not stupid.  It's like literally it's for like 50 cents.  You get 10 of them and stuff like that.  Yeah.  You know.  All right.  Just going to sit here and pop on a Cuban.  That's OK.  Patiently waiting for the rock.  I guess we could take another break.  And the rock should be here in a few minutes.  We're going to continue our interview with Jeffrey Ross.  And we'll bring rock into the fold as well, Anthony.  OK?  All right.  And don't forget, Jeffrey Ross at Caroline,  starting tonight at 8 PM.  Well, I got a buzz.  And playing all weekend.  Through Sunday.  Through Sunday.  Yeah.  Masturbation in the car. 
[110:00]
 We can't pass that up.  No, no.  I'm going to go right to that.  That's like breaking news on CNN.  Right.  And they just break in.  When we get something that says masturbation in the car,  we have to go right to it.  Katie.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  What's going on?  Nothing.  I've been trying to get through for ages.  Wanted to see if anybody out there ever  masturbates while driving in the car.  Yeah, we've had a few of those calls.  I've done that, sure.  Yeah.  Jesus.  On a regular basis?  You've been.  Wait a minute.  Yeah. 
[110:30]
 I'll minute.  I've masturbated thinking of my car.  I've masturbated in the car.  In your car?  Oh, yeah.  Long trip?  I slept in a car two days ago.  How long of a trip does that have to be?  You've got to spank one out.  Sometimes you get really bored in the car.  If you're stuck in traffic and stuff,  you want to pass the time.  A couple times I've really done a great job parallel parking,  and I would say, oh, gosh.  I'm just going to need to.  I just got to throw one out.  And then.  Great.  One move.  Yeah, Katie. 
[111:00]
 I like to play with myself when I'm driving to work  in the morning.  Well, what about driving home?  Sometimes, yeah.  Driving to work in the morning?  So you're sitting at work with like stink finger and stuff?  No.  No?  When you wash up?  Well, you've got to be a little goopy down there.  Well, you know.  You don't want.  I'm in there.  Well, could you start masturbating?  You could touch the outside.  Are you in the car now?  Yeah. 
[111:30]
 Could you, you know.  They'll let her rip.  How am I going to steer?  Well, if you do it in the morning,  you could do it in the afternoon.  Well, I'm not usually on the cell phone at the same time.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, I think a lot of people do that in their cars, sure.  Yeah, we've heard from some people.  I think more, amazingly enough, more women than men.  Men just, I don't think they can wait to get out to the car.  Is that a male thing to bring out?  Well, they're not spanking out in the car.  Katie, hold on a sec.  This guy in line nine, speaking of guys whacking 
[112:00]
 Greg.  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  Nothing.  She really caught my attention real quick,  because about three days ago, I just got back from Florida.  You know, I love you guys.  When I came back, it turned right to hell on.  And I was coming home from the airport.  And nonetheless, you know, I'm driving a freaking blazer.  So, you know, I'm a little higher up than every average,  you know, guy in the world.  And what happens, but you look over,  and there's a guy looking at another girl in the eye.  I'm sorry about that.  No cursing.  No cursing.  So you saw a guy looking at a girl, and what was he doing?  Yeah, rewind.  All right.  So a guy looking at the girl, thank goodness he 
[112:30]
 was looking at the girl, because I would have flipped.  Otherwise, he was looking at her,  and he obviously was making a very standard motion  with his right arm, that you could only  put it into one situation there.  He was just really getting off on this,  and it was just the worst situation I've ever seen  in my life.  I really hope the men never have to run  into other guys on the road satisfying themselves.  So didn't you just turn away when you realized  what the guy was doing?  I sped away when the light turned green.  It was at a red light, for goodness sakes. 
[113:00]
 Oh, I see.  What are you going to do in that situation?  You look away.  Well, I did look away for it.  I turned away.  It's not like every guy in the highway is whacking it.  You can look somewhere.  When you're in the situation, when  you're sitting next to him at a red light,  you're going to inch forward, so he's out of your sight  and not think about it?  Hell yeah.  I try to.  All right.  Well, thank you.  No problem.  Bye.  Peace.  Jason, you're next.  What's going on?  Yo, what's up, dude?  All right. 
[113:30]
 I crashed my own bike.  Wait, I don't know if they dumped out.  So you crashed your van, your work van,  because you were whacking it?  Yeah.  Yo.  I'm on the road all day.  What am I going to do with myself?  I'm riding around looking at penthouses,  and I slammed into the abutment on the turnpike  right by New Brunswick.  Yeah, it was pretty funny at the time.  My boss didn't think so, but I thought it was pretty funny.  That's hilarious.  You guys are great, man.  I love your show.  Hey, thank you, Jason.  I've been in my van all day long. 
[114:00]
 Obviously, I have another job now.  They fired me, but you know.  All right, well, thank you.  Yo.  Very good.  You guys have a great New Year.  All right, you too.  Later.  How you can spank it like that?  Look at all the people on the phones  that want to talk about it.  So is it a common thing?  Yeah, I don't know.  That's a little rough.  What happens with the toll?  Yeah, really?  You got to time it, right?  Oh, here you go.  You got to time it, right?  Not on the parkway.  Got to be an open road.  That parkway is every 15 feet.  You got to put it back in your pants.  It's another toll. 
[114:30]
 It's like, hey, the change will come out of my head.  Oh, God.  Here you go, pal.  Oh, my God.  The rock is here.  OK.  Oh, is he?  Let's take a break.  We'll talk to the rock next.  He's freaking huge.  This is Pee-Poo Pee and Anthony.  I, I, I.  This is debauchery mania.  I, I, I.  Prostate exams for everyone.  I, I, I.  One, one, one, two, seven.  WNEW.  If you smell what the rock is cooking.  It's 1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show in studio. 
[115:00]
 Jeffrey Ross.  Yeah.  And slowly but surely making his way through the.  Oh, my God.  It is the rock.  Poorly smoked is the rock.  What's up?  Look at him.  That's him.  Jesus Christ.  Look at the look at the size of this guy.  This people's champ.  He's going to kick your ass, Anthony.  What?  Hey, rock.  What's going on, folks?  How you doing?  Oh, come on.  He's the nice rock.  Hey, Sandy.  What do you think of the rock?  I like Sandy's.  Your girlfriend's creaming.  I'll be my girlfriend wants to do you a Dwayne rock, sir. 
[115:30]
 Oh, yeah.  You got all the girls worked up around the station here today.  All right.  Yeah, it's all right.  Everywhere you go, the chicks are chasing and stuff.  They're in the life of the rock.  Yeah.  So what is the rock?  A married man?  What's a great one to do?  Yeah.  Yeah, I see it.  Look at that freaking wedding band.  Rock on the rock.  Rock on the rock.  Yeah.  And she's pretty cold because I guess she's got it. 
[116:00]
 I mean, girls chasing you all over the place.  Yeah, she's good.  She's supportive.  You give her the rock bottom there.  She knows her role.  In the sack.  She knows her role.  You give her the rock bottom in the sack.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, huh?  The people something else.  Right.  There's this girl that we've got to get to really fast.  Sarah.  Yes.  This girl is losing it.  I think she represents every female in the tri-state area.  So we decided to throw you on, Sarah. 
[116:30]
 Sarah, you're talking to the great one, the rock.  Oh my god.  Oh, I would just love to say you are the sexiest man alive.  You have enabled me to have orgasms with my boyfriend  for the first time.  I put out your video.  And every time we do it, we watch your video.  Oh, but you are the best.  Oh my god.  Well, thank you so much.  Now you can talk to the rock.  I thought you'd be bigger, man.  I thought you'd be bigger.  You think?  Yeah. 
[117:00]
 That's a jacket.  Don't let the jacket fool you.  That's Jeffrey Ross.  A very funny man.  It doesn't matter who it is.  Uh-oh.  Don't mess with me, man.  I'm a Black Dome karate.  Is that right?  Yeah.  OK.  Hello?  Yes, what else?  Yes.  I would just like to know if the Rock and Tellers was  in store for his character in the future.  Well, just to continue to entertain the millions  and the millions of the Rocks fans, obviously.  The Rock's going to get back in the title hunt pretty damn soon  without giving away too many storylines. 
[117:30]
 Why are you talking about him like he's not here?  What's that?  Oh my god.  Is this a girl who watches the Rock video?  Yes.  I got it for Christmas, and I've been happy ever since.  I was just wondering, are you going  to by any chance go to the WWF store in Manhattan anytime soon?  As a matter of fact, I was there for lunch today,  and I'll be there at the grand opening January 19.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you.  I'll see you there.  Bye.  And you're just going to see her. 
[118:00]
 She'll be leaving the trail for the Rock.  And obviously, the Rock, you're promoting his new book,  and you're doing a book signing tonight?  I'm doing a book signing tonight.  Yeah, Tower Books.  Right.  And I've been kind of on the go all day  and on the go for the rest of the month, for that matter.  Rock, we got to ask you, because you are a f-  We're in Raw Magazine, like chewing on your character  and stuff.  Yeah, you see that?  We're in Raw Magazine this month.  Saw it.  And I saw the article.  You did.  Yeah.  And I'm chewing on you.  But Opie's got your ass in his mouth. 
[118:30]
 You can really smell what the Rock's cooking there.  So you're doing the book signing tonight.  We got to ask you.  You've been doing the book tour today.  Why the view?  Why the view?  Did you feel out of place this morning with Barbara and Star  Jones and the rest of them?  No, not at all.  Well, maybe not too many people know this,  but they're some of the biggest Rock fans there are.  Meredith, and especially Star, and Lisa Ling, and of course,  Joy.  We got to work on Barbara a little bit.  She's getting around.  She's coming out to it.  The Rock likes hanging out with the view chicks, though? 
[119:00]
 Well, it was good.  I did the view last year, and it was a good time.  So I decided to do it again.  Nice fact, though, if it was between you and Star Jones  for a title belt, you'd be a little bit intimidated.  You feel so?  Or I might do the job for Star.  I wouldn't want to meet her in a dark alley.  That's all I could say.  Say sweetheart.  Yeah, OK.  So many people want to talk to you.  Jennifer, what's going on?  We got the Rock in the studio.  Hi.  How are you doing?  OK. 
[119:30]
 Oh, boy.  Talk to the Rock now, Jennifer.  Oh, I can tell him he's like my favorite wrestler,  and I never used to watch wrestling.  My boyfriend got me to watch it, and now he  got me a six-foot poster of the Rock,  and I kiss him every night before I go to bed.  Oh.  You've got to get up early for the sixth grade, though.  How old are you?  I'm 18.  OK.  I appreciate that.  Oh, yeah.  I just want to know, can I have tickets?  On my birthday, my mom's going to get me tickets front row,  but I don't know if I'll be able to. 
[120:00]
 I'm sure Opie and Andy can take care of that.  You know what?  18.  She's eight and one or nine.  No, you know what?  I think we have a pair of tickets  to the Continental Arena show.  Screw it.  We'll give them to you, Jennifer.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh my god.  Thank you so much.  Hold on the line, OK?  These are my tickets.  Bye.  Tell Spaz Line 1.  Sorry, Jeff.  She gets a pair of tickets.  So what can we expect in this book, Rock?  What's in here?  Well, it's pretty candid, pretty open.  Obviously, I talk about a lot of things.  Not only do I talk in the character of the Rock.  A lot of it is in the character of the Rock, of course, 
[120:30]
 with your typical Rock promo and entertaining Rock stuff.  But a lot of it is Zwayne Johnson.  And growing up in the business, growing up in this industry,  a lot of things I've seen, we all got our hard luck stories  and mine was no different, no worse, no better than the others.  And in that, you see that.  And a lot of times, a lot of people say,  you take the Rock, Stone Cold, that saga right there.  A lot of people see that out in the arenas  and all the interviews we've done and things like that.  And of course, the matches we've had, well,  not a lot of people dare say anybody other than people  in our office and people backstage 
[121:00]
 see exactly what goes on between the Rock and Stone Cold  in the back.  Intimately kind of go into that.  And just a whole bunch of things is, of course,  a very important chapter on Owen.  And a lot of it, obviously, growing up in the business  and seeing what I've seen so far.  Right.  You think Stone Cold will be back?  There's a lot of questions.  It seems up in the air.  He's going in for surgery any day, right?  Yeah, I believe he's got his surgery,  so it's January 17th.  And yeah, I think he's going to be back.  He knows there's going to be one more Rock, Austin,  WrestleMania.  I see him next year.  Right. 
[121:30]
 You've got to feel pretty good.  You're like getting all the heat, man.  He better hope he doesn't come back, buddy.  That's why I'm so sure.  You better hope the Rock don't come over there  and put his foot right in your camp.  You better hope.  I'm not afraid of you, man.  My dad's a lawyer, mother.  Jeffrey and the Rock, man.  We could have fight clubbing.  I don't think it would last too long.  It would last long, but.  Mike, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  All right, you got a question for the Rock?  Yeah, I do.  Hey, Rock, first of all, let me preface this  by saying you are my man.  Thank you.  Now, there's a rumor going around. 
[122:00]
 Do you want something stuck up your candy ass?  There's a rumor going around that you had some sort  of breast reduction, shall I say.  Yeah.  Is that true?  Yeah.  It's because you're simulant, right?  Yeah.  Well, no, not because I was simulant.  Right.  Wait, you really had breast reduction, is that true?  Yeah, it was one of those things where  it was like a part of a liposuction deal done.  And I had a little bit of fat.  I had that taken out.  Let me ask you one more question.  Did you have like baloney tits or something?  No, it wasn't baloney.  It wasn't anything like a Mark Henry titter or anything. 
[122:30]
 No.  Hey, you guys got any tickets for me?  Honestly, yeah.  I'm in seventh grade.  Yeah, but you're not a cute girl that's ready to have an orgasm.  I can be.  I'll dress up again.  That's OK.  Hey, I'll give you tickets to see me, man.  OK.  Like Caroline?  Yeah.  I'll actually, yeah.  Yeah, Jeffrey Ross up here in a Caroline tonight.  Let's not forget him today.  All right, fellas.  Thanks a lot.  All right, thank you.  We're kind of pissed off that you got mankind fired there,  Rock.  You're pissed off that the Rock got mankind fired? 
[123:00]
 Did you not follow the storyline?  The pink slip, man.  The pink slip.  Do you think that the Rock got mankind fired?  It was you or him.  What's that?  It was you or him that had it going.  Prefer that the Rock had been fired?  Well, you know.  Mankind, too.  Mankind's pretty cool.  Mankind is no doubt pretty cool.  I don't want to diss the Rock or anything like that.  But mankind is pretty cool.  And I think the WWF could use him, have him back again.  Is Cactus Jack coming back?  Mankind will be back, no doubt. 
[123:30]
 Cactus might be back, too.  We'll see.  Yeah.  Seems to be growing his beard a little longer,  looking a little more like Cactus.  He's getting ready.  Matt, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to know why the Rock.  I mean, everybody loves him.  But that people's elbow is the lamest  finishing move I've ever seen.  Matt doesn't want to.  I mean, I've been watching this for a long time,  since like the late 70s.  And I remember in the mid-80s, this guy,  his name was Coco Beware.  He had this thing called the Ghostbuster  that was devastating.  I mean, I'm wondering how come such a well-known character  doesn't have a better finishing move?  I love his finishing move. 
[124:00]
 Well, let the Rock ask you this.  How exactly are you the authority on finishing moves?  All I'm saying is that it doesn't look painful.  It really doesn't.  Well, you bounce off the roll,  and you do your arm thing, and you do a little dance,  and then you drop on the guy,  and it looks like you barely touched him.  It doesn't look painful.  So are you to tell the Rock  that the Stunner is physically painful?  I didn't say anything about the Stunner.  I'm just talking about you.  Why am I going to talk about someone that's not there?  Well, what are you talking about?  You really don't even know what you're talking about.  I mean, I didn't do anything. 
[124:30]
 I've been watching this a long time.  It doesn't matter how long you've been watching it.  What the Rock guarantees is this.  If you lay your fat ass down  and let the Rock drop the finger on you,  then trust the Rock.  That's funny.  You know what?  I wish he would do that to me,  because I would take it for everything he has.  Oh, wow, man.  I will say that.  Plus, he's bringing in his finishing move, the lawyer.  I mean, is that a finishing move?  I'll tell you what.  Well, the Rock is easy to find.  Is that a finishing move, or can you make it up?  All right, thank you, man.  Hey, Chris, you're next. 
[125:00]
 What's going on?  What's going on?  Hey, Rock.  What's that?  What's your real name again?  Dwayne.  It doesn't matter what your real name is.  The Rock didn't even answer you, Giproni.  Yeah.  Yeah, it doesn't matter at all what I'm cooking.  All right.  All right.  Well, you guys really know how to track them.  I'm just gonna let you know that.  Well, let me tell you,  we sure share a lot of the same demographic as WF.  I'll tell you that much. 
[125:30]
 We got a lot of the same listeners  as you guys have viewers.  You know, it's the young male audience.  Aside from, I'm sorry, Rock,  the ladies coming out in droves for the Rock.  At times.  You ever see some of those signs and get pissed off?  Some of the funny ones out in the audience  that catch your eye?  Oh, yeah.  Never get pissed off.  I don't know.  That's just their fans being creative.  Do they make you laugh inside when you're trying to wrestle,  when you see some of those things?  They make me laugh when I'm not even inside.  It's cracked up. 
[126:00]
 There's something about seeing a sign  that says a big red retard.  There's something about that.  The picture of King.  That was me.  Rock believes it.  Is it true that you're gonna wrestle Chief Jay Strongbow?  What?  You don't remember that guy?  Yeah, I remember Chief Jay.  What kind of question is that?  You guys actually pay this jabroni?  He came in to plug his gig at Caroline's.  See, can't you tell he's a very funny man, right?  What's jabroni?  What's jabroni?  What's his gig at?  Where?  I'm in the circus. 
[126:30]
 Is that right?  He just got back from Cuba.  This morning.  And he's been handing out the Cuban cigars and stuff.  You want one?  No, not for me.  You're a health freak, I bet.  You're a very good looking man.  I'm not gay, but I would definitely say I was.  This is the best looking guy I've ever seen.  I can't believe you're...  No scars, no nothing.  Inside.  I understand.  On the heart, man.  There's a lot of scars that he'll talk about in his book.  Book signing tonight.  We have a few more minutes with you, Rock or what? 
[127:00]
 Yeah.  All right, quick break and we'll be back.  Stay there.  Tudes with Tudes.  I think every time we open our mouths,  we're pissing someone off.  Oh, dear, Anthony.  In here, in here.  We're out of control.  We're so wacky.  All right, knock it off.  1027 WNEW.  If you smell what the rock is cooking.  Ah, you got that right.  We got the rock live in the studio, Anthony.  Yes.  Actually, Dwayne, Dwayne Johnson.  Do you want us to call you Dwayne? 
[127:30]
 Rock Dwayne.  The rock is his Hebrew name.  All the same.  And 1027 WNEW.  Jeffrey Ross also in studio appearing  at the Caroline's tonight through the weekend.  And the rock promoting his book.  Yes, the rock says.  The rock says.  There's some great anecdotes in here.  Have you been studying up on the rock, Jeffrey?  Can I read a couple lines, is that all right?  Yeah, go ahead.  Chapter, page 277.  With the success, of course,  has come a fair amount of criticism, 
[128:00]
 most of which is either unfounded or misdirected.  It's funny.  I don't recall Brian De Palma getting that much heat  when he directed Scarface.  I don't recall hearing anyone jump all over Steven Spielberg  for the violence and I don't know, man.  Who was the ghostwriter with you?  Mike Tyson?  Show lady.  Mike Tyson.  Oh my God.  No, no, that came directly from me.  Well, a lot of the criticism from the violence, I guess.  Well, wait a minute.  What's the problem with your lighting?  Oh, I'm just kidding.  Okay. 
[128:30]
 Oh yeah, now you're back.  Yeah, I'm real quick.  Look at him back there.  I mean, I mean.  I'm just kidding.  I'm afraid of you.  I'm trying to act tough, but I'm definitely a little afraid.  And they make me sit next to you.  It's not like they hide me.  I'm frankly on the guy's lap.  We placed you there on purpose to have him as a buffer.  We have this, all this counter space.  We're that.  We're a buffer.  A buffer, a buffer, sorry.  Yeah, we're just kind of scared of you.  We're like Pessimistic geeks.  So the holidays.  Yeah. 
[129:00]
 It's clear that you haven't been working out.  Have you just took the holidays off?  Yeah, I've been kind of sick.  You should get your act together because,  Rock, we are waiting for you to just pummel him.  You can do it at any time.  Might not be worth the rocks.  What's with the watch?  Is that a Rolex though?  What is that?  Exactly, I got that off 48th Street.  The guy named Rico over there.  I don't want to work.  You don't want to buy one that's worth a little money.  You know, the Rock, have you ever seen  what the Rock does in the ring? 
[129:30]
 Yeah, I'm a huge, huge fan of Stone Cold.  But anyway.  He actually likes Goldberg, he told us off mic.  And we don't even talk about the WCW on our show.  I'm a big wrestling fan.  I love wrestling.  All right, the Rock doing a signing of Tower Records.  Where is this?  East 4th Street and Lafayette in the East Village.  I hear it's a mob scene already.  A mob scene since what, 5 a.m. this morning I'm here?  Man, a ton of people want to talk to the Rock.  Let's go, the phone's here. 
[130:00]
 Mike, you're next, what's going on?  Finally, I'm off hold.  Hey Rock, I just want to ask you,  what's the deal with you getting your ass kicked lately?  Lately?  Well yeah, I mean, every time you go out,  you're getting pounded.  Man, are you referring to Raw where it was three on one  and the Rock still won that match?  Is that the one you're talking about?  That's true.  Thank God Mankind came in and saved your candy ass,  if I may say candy ass.  Well you may not say that to the Rock.  Oh, I'm sorry Rock, I felt that. 
[130:30]
 No, there you are, Jabroni.  I felt we knew each other a little better now.  Absolutely not.  Which I must say was a very good job.  Security, security.  And beating up those guys.  But I got another question for you.  When you're at the arena, coming up?  Yeah, he knows about it.  Are you going to talk at the Continental Arena  or are you just going to wrestle?  Is the Rock going to talk or just wrestle?  Yeah, are you going to do your thing?  Are you going to get up on the ring rope  or are you going to go nuts and get the crowd going or what? 
[131:00]
 Yeah, it's likely.  All right, because I've heard rumors that a lot of times  if it's not Heat or Raw, you guys don't do any talking.  No, not with the Rock.  Every single night, it doesn't really matter  whether it's a Heat or a House Show or a Raw,  SmackDown, it doesn't matter.  All right, cool, man.  I definitely see there.  All right, thank you, Mike.  No, no more.  Julio!  Yes, how you doing, guys?  You're next with the Rock, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Rock, I want you to take Jeff  and check him into the SmackDown Hotel right now. 
[131:30]
 You don't like Jeffrey Ross making fun of the Rock?  No, come on, he's coming out of here.  I don't even have peace of mind.  I'll give you a ride on my boat.  I got my own move.  All right, you got your own move?  Yeah.  What the hell do you mean by that?  It's called the tickle.  Do you have a question for the Rock?  Yes, Rock.  I rubbed my head in your familiar.  All right, I got to take care of somebody  in that Royal Rumble right now.  What's that?  Say that again?  What are you gonna take care of on the Royal Rumble?  Well, right now, it's probably just gonna be 
[132:00]
 in the Rumble itself.  All right, Dan, you're next with the Rock.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Hey, I'm just a big fan of you guys,  and I wanna call up and talk to the Rock.  Hey, Rock.  Hey, listen, I know you've been doing some TV shows  here and there, and I was wondering  if you're gonna be on any one anytime soon.  Um.  It doesn't matter what you're doing.  I love you, Rock, you're great.  I love you, John Chee.  I love you, John Chee.  Easy, you got the Rock. 
[132:30]
 How many times a day does that happen to the Rock?  Constantly.  People throwing your lines back in your face.  Constantly.  It doesn't matter.  See what you started, Rock?  Jesus Christ, that's gotta get a little frustrating.  Uh, Joe, you're next, what's going on?  Joe, you're next.  We lose Joe?  All right.  Um, Sal, you got a question for the Rock?  Uh-oh, Sal, you're next, let's go.  Hey, Rock, what's up?  Hi, man.  Oh, nice.  Hey, I just, uh, Rock, I heard a few rumors 
[133:00]
 that you're gonna be totally changing your appearance  and your personality and everything.  No, no truth to that.  Uh, cause all that crap on the internet  that you can't hardly believe and stuff.  And I got a suggestion for all of you.  Yeah.  Instead of having a train wreck, which is good,  you should have Rock come up with something  and start to play that, like, uh.  Yeah, it's not a bad idea.  He doesn't know what you're talking about,  but we'll tell him off air.  All right, you guys rule.  You're the great one, like, and uh.  I got nervous there all again. 
[133:30]
 It's hysterical.  All right, Sal, thank you.  All right, Mike, you're next with the Rock.  What's going on?  Hello?  Yeah, Mike.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Rock, you're the great one, right?  So listen to me.  Why aren't you getting any push?  You lost to the boss man.  What's up with that?  We need to call Vince.  That's boss man.  He's some jaboni off the streets.  All right?  All right, Mike.  All right, thanks a lot.  Later. 
[134:00]
 Thank you.  Uh, cute kid.  Rock, because of you, we have all the kids listening today.  They begged their moms to listen  to the Ophian Anthony show.  Yeah.  And we had to hold off on our shows we usually have.  We have, well, one of them we had was a girl  that shot an egg out of her vagina.  Nine feet.  Wow.  So usually the kids don't get to listen.  Wonder why.  You should have been here for that show.  And you think the WWF is shocking.  You should see this show on a daily basis. 
[134:30]
 Although the Moola Mae Young thing,  what do you personally think of that whole thing?  Oh, it's interesting.  Yeah, it certainly is.  When you see a half nude old broad  getting thrown over the top rope,  how the hell do you change the channel?  It's impossible.  I'm glued to the screen when that happens.  You don't have to deal with them, right?  They don't usually put you in any matches.  No, the Rock's really not currently involved  with the Moola Mae Young storyline.  Yeah.  Thank God, right?  Although is Mark Henry really banging that old broad? 
[135:00]
 I really can't tell.  It seems like he is really romantically involved.  He may be.  Knowing him, right?  He may be, just for the record, he may be.  Picture that scene, man.  Hey, when's Vince coming back?  He's on his six week vacation or something?  No, pretty soon.  Yeah, because we're getting a little tired  of the Stephanie storyline.  It was fun at first, but now it's time to move on.  Yeah, Stephanie in that triple H.  She's gotta stop making that shame face.  You ever see her, Stephanie making a shame face? 
[135:30]
 Like you just smelt a bad fart?  He like puckers up the lips.  She does the same thing.  Put some on.  Like they're smelling what the rock is cooking  after Chinese or something.  I don't know.  All right, Anthony, you're next with The Rock.  What's going on today?  Rocky, what's up?  Hey, man.  Listen, man, I know you gotta show a little respect  because I saw a triple H and he's married to a boy.  What do you think about China?  Is she hot or what?  That's not bad.  Not bad. 
[136:00]
 Are you digging her?  Well, you know, those cans, man.  She's looking a lot better than she used to.  You know, I'm not giving her that much.  That's for sure.  Rocky, man, you're the best.  She cleaned up real nice.  I appreciate it.  Take care, man.  All right.  There's a guy on the line that said he went to school  with you.  Chris.  Yeah, Rock.  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey, man.  I was just wondering, now, when are you gonna come up  and do a line?  Yeah?  Don't you think your line's a little played out now?  No, not really.  You may think it.  Yeah, I think a lot.  But it doesn't matter what you think.  You know what?  Let me ask you another question.  No, seriously. 
[136:30]
 I got a good line for you.  Yeah?  I'm falling and I can't get up.  That would catch on.  That could be the next one.  That's a T-shirt right there.  Scott, you're next with The Rock.  What's going on?  Hey, how you doing, open, Anthony?  What's going on?  All right.  Rock, I have to say, you're one of the greatest performers  I've ever seen on TV, man.  I'm excited.  I got my three-year-old son running around my house,  telling me what The Rock is cooking.  And you guys are great on there.  Well, thank you.  All right, thanks.  I appreciate that.  Thanks a lot, man.  The accolades just coming in.  Thanks a lot. 
[137:00]
 All right.  I appreciate that.  Thanks a lot.  The accolades just coming in.  It's amazing.  All our listeners are tongue-tied with The Rock in studio today.  Yeah.  Are you going to be moving on to movies, sitcoms?  You want to do all that stuff?  I've done a lot of television work.  I've seen the commercials and stuff.  They're hilarious.  Probably this year.  Yeah?  I'm going to drop in the movie.  Right.  Now, you're a big Elvis fan.  Is that true?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Could you sing us a line, maybe?  No.  No, no.  Come on. 
[137:30]
 Awesome pictures, man.  It does.  This picture of you and Andre DeGina as little kids.  What do you say?  Look at that.  That's you as a kid?  How'd you meet him, man?  How'd you meet him?  Wait a minute.  That's you as a kid?  It is.  Yeah, easy.  The Rock's looking good there.  I'm just saying.  How's that picture around?  I could relate to the hairdo.  That's a good one.  That's right.  I could definitely relate.  Was he a cool guy?  Yeah, real cool guy.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Right after that was snapped, he threw Rock to the floor.  That's right.  It was a memorable moment. 
[138:00]
 Wow, that's something.  Sporting the fro.  That's it.  During the early days, yeah.  Boy, that was a curse.  I remember that.  My hair just like, like a big dandelion head.  I had the same thing, Rock.  I understand.  I know where you're coming from.  You feel the Rock on that one.  I feel your pain.  Dan, you're next with the Rock.  What's going on?  Rock, Opie, and Anthony, what's up?  How you doing?  All right.  I want to ask the great one who he looked up to as a kid who is his favorite wrestler  all time.  Favorite wrestler?  Well, obviously, you know, I looked up to my dad and my grandfather who were in the 
[138:30]
 business, but I'd have to say probably the entertainers would have to be probably Magnificent  Morocco, even including Ric Flair as well.  Keep up the great work.  You guys are awesome.  Rock, you are the great one.  I'm not going to bother you with doing any of your tacky catch lines, but I know what  you're talking about.  God damn.  Eddie, you're next with the Rock.  We only have a few minutes left here.  What's going on?  Yeah, I just want to ask the Rock, what he thought about when the road dog was on your  team?  You know, he's talking all that trash about him.  Oh, yeah, the road dog did talk a little trash about the Rock. 
[139:00]
 Oh, yeah, it almost sounded like you two, you know, were talking real life, kind of  have a little tiff going.  No, there's no tiff with the Rock.  There's a tiff with Road Dog.  You know, he's the type of guy who's kind of insecure at times and very jealous and  it's just that sometimes.  When are you going to lay the smack down on him again?  Whenever I get the script.  All right, Rock, you want to go one on one with me?  No, you might hurt the Rock, man.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah, Rock. 
[139:30]
 You're great, Rock.  I'll talk to you later.  Appreciate it.  Hey, Rock, does it ever get real in the ring when you really don't like the guy?  Like you give it a little extra push or something?  Not really.  I mean, I'm pretty much professional in there and the rest of the guys in WWF are professional  guys.  We got an issue.  It'll be handled back in the back and then never in the ring in front of everybody.  Right.  That's a nice curse from the Rock.  That's what it is.  You know, I've never got a professional.  Curse in the book, too.  What's your personal view on toning down the whole damn wrestling thing?  Because it pisses us off. 
[140:00]
 All these people coming out of the woodwork saying it's too violent.  Well, it's easy to say that.  It's easy to say that.  You know, on network television, you'll find it a lot worse.  We don't murder people, obviously, on our show.  And a lot of times our show is reality based.  But at the same time, you'd be an idiot to think that it's completely legitimate because  it's not.  I remember seeing the boss man getting hanged.  That's right.  That's true.  Wait a minute.  That looked like murder to me.  But then like Wile E. Coyote, he was back the next day with no problem.  That's right.  Wait a minute.  They hung him yesterday. 
[140:30]
 What happened?  Some stuff's real.  That blood on Austin's head sometimes, I don't know.  That seems real.  There's a lot of real things that happen.  Blood's real.  All right.  Any contact that maybe shouldn't have happened?  I see a lot of times, looks like X-Pac doing that spinning back kick.  How the hell you know where that's going to land every time?  Well, that's just one thing.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, sometimes I swear to Christ, you just smack someone in the side of their head.  You see him like that?  Wait a minute.  He just kicked him in the head.  Right.  Bleeding.  Did we catch anything from X-Pac?  Off-guard, yeah. 
[141:00]
 Yeah, a couple of them.  Yeah.  Hangs a little bit weak anyway though compared to The Rock.  Look at you.  Right?  You break him in half.  Mark, you're next with The Rock.  What's up?  Anthony is such a wimp.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Why?  Why don't you do your impersonation of him?  What?  The Great One.  Do your impersonation to his face.  What impersonation?  The impersonation you always do when you talk about him. 
[141:30]
 I don't know what you're talking about.  In a loving way.  He doesn't trash The Rock.  I don't trash The Rock.  He doesn't trash The Great One.  It's like everybody does an impression of The Rock.  All right, wait.  What has he said, Mark?  He's always saying, you know, oh, I'm going to take this and stick it up this.  You're always saying...  Well, Mark, why don't you take that telephone, shine it up real nice, turn that sun bit sideways  and stick it straight up your candy ass.  You smell! 
[142:00]
 The Rock is cooking.  That old gag rock, you know.  That'll show him.  He's rolling his eyes like...  I'm sure for a second people are looking at each of us thinking, who's The Rock in here,  you know?  You really can't tell.  All right, Mark.  All right, shut up, Mark.  Matt, you're next.  What's going on?  Hey guys, how's it going tonight?  All right.  Rock, I ever wondered, with so many cool heels and the lack of hated heels, I was wondering 
[142:30]
 if you ever had to turn The Rock evil again.  Would you ever think about bringing back third generation superstar Rocky Maivia since everybody  pretty much hated him?  No, not necessarily because he was a baby face.  When Rocky Maivia became The Rock, The Rock went out there and he crapped on the people.  He did what he had to do to get legitimate heel heat.  He did that and made no bones about it.  Would say, hey, this ain't sing along with The Rock and good night trailer park trash 
[143:00]
 every single night.  No, I think if the time were ever to happen where The Rock would turn evil again, he wouldn't  have to go back to Rocky Maivia.  He'd just have to kind of do exactly what he has to do.  There's still a lot of arrogance and there's still a lot of arrogance, a lot of confidence,  a lot of a lot of things you still see in The Rock now.  It just happens he's a baby face.  But when the time comes and it'll eventually happen, whether it's two years or four or  five years down the road, he'll just be still the same rock.  You'll just hate him.  All right.  Thanks a lot, man. 
[143:30]
 Good luck with your future, right?  Appreciate it.  Well, that's the funny thing is you didn't even try to be a good guy.  I mean, it just happened.  He'd go out there and say he was the people's champ and the people were like, no, you're  not.  You're like being pompous and saying, I'm the people's champ.  And then after a while, it just caught on.  You brainwashed everybody, hypnotized them or something.  So like, yeah, he is the people's champ.  Hey, Chris, what do you have for The Rock?  Rock, this is one of the millions of fans.  I was calling to find out what kind of injuries you've ever sustained in the ring.  In the ring, other than a couple of knee injuries, I've had a couple of surgeries already. 
[144:00]
 That done shoulder injuries all the time.  Pretty much your typical bumps and bruises.  Yeah.  And time and time again, you see like black and blue marks on some of the wrestlers from  going off the ring and everything.  What about when you flip over the top?  What do you say?  Well, you won't see too much flipping over the top from The Rock.  Not like the Hardy Boys or anything like that.  They get into it.  That ladder match is still one of the most phenomenal, amazing things I've ever seen.  We got Sickboy in the studio.  He's like a wrestling expert. 
[144:30]
 You got a quick question for The Rock there, Sickboy?  He's been chomping at the bit all afternoon.  Yeah.  I was actually kind of curious about, remember the DMTV special over the summer?  They had the feature on Tony Atlas, who was your dad's tag team partner.  I was kind of wondering if you saw that and what you thought about.  They kind of highlighted some of the hard times that Tony's gone through over the years  and him talking about being so desperate that he wanted to kill himself and all that.  Just what your thought on it was, you know, with your dad being his partner.  Well, before The Rock actually answers that, just out of curiosity, you know, The Rock's 
[145:00]
 heard of your name and The Rock's got a question for you regarding your website.  Oh, no.  Actually, I had no idea it was you who was, it goes by the name of Sickboy, but it was  brought to my attention last night from the office that your website carries a lot of  racist comments and I just want to hear about that.  And for the most part, I just want to know, it sounds like all you guys are friends and  if you guys have known that this is a guy who has racist comments on his website and  if in fact you guys are behind that. 
[145:30]
 Oh, I've seen his website a few times.  He's got a bunch of writers on there and I think they just open it up to everything.  Yeah, I don't think there's anything ever been racist, no more than any of the humor  that goes on in this show.  Wait, no, don't flame our show.  Don't want to bust into that.  Well, I'll tell you what, you know, after it was read, a couple of lines were read yesterday,  they obviously called me, read a couple of lines for me, said something like, you know,  The Rock being half black, half Samoan, doesn't know whether he should go rob houses or eat 
[146:00]
 food or whatever it is and saying, Jacklyn's from the jungle and Mark Henry, something  about him being a gorilla or monkey or something like that.  So elaborate on that.  And if that's the case, if you guys are behind this guy, then really, I really don't even  want to be here for that matter.  And I certainly don't want to talk to you.  Well, I mean, if there's been any, I mean, this is nothing that's been written by me.  I've got a staff of 15 writers that are on the site and the site is done as an entertainment  site, you know, adding humor and just commentary on what goes on in wrestling. 
[146:30]
 I haven't seen anything that was racist on the side of there was anything that I ever  saw as being too extreme.  It would be gone in a heartbeat.  You know, there's been plenty of stuff to get all being saying that Jacqueline is from  the jungle and Mark Henry is a monkey and whether or not The Rock wants to rob houses  because he's half black or he wants to eat because he's half Samoan.  Quite frankly, I find that offensive.  Well, I haven't seen that.  I mean, I haven't I haven't seen those posts at all.  I don't know if anybody else has.  And I'll be honest, I've never read any of that. 
[147:00]
 I mean, I've never seen one thing up on up on my site that would ever be racist because  that's not you know, that's not how I was raised and that's not how I would run a website.  But how it's on there?  Well, I haven't seen it on there.  If it's on there, it will absolutely be removed.  But, you know, I absolutely do not condone nor do I, you know, support any of the statements  made by and if, you know, somebody on there has made racist comments like that, they're 
[147:30]
 absolutely going to be fired.  Can I be excused?  Really?  Wow.  All right.  Well, for the most part, it's one of those things where, again, I was contacted, I was  made aware of it and the officers made aware of it.  And and quite frankly, I don't want to have anything to do with you.  I don't want to answer your questions.  And if you guys have anything to do this guy, I quite frankly don't want to have anything  to do.  Honestly, I've never read any of that stuff on the site.  And that's the truth.  No, we have.  Well, yeah, we have.  We have a mom whenever we have wrestlers on. 
[148:00]
 He's an expert, knows a lot about it.  We have that on.  I don't know anything about any racist postings.  Like I said, we don't we don't condone that either.  Well, I was about to my attention last night and I read to me over the phone and detail  when you have when you have an open forum, especially on the Internet, there's not really  much you can do about.  Well, apparently it was from the writers who you must employ.  Well, they're not they're not paid writers at all.  They're just they're hired based on their writing skills. 
[148:30]
 But if I had known somebody was black or black, for that matter.  Well, you know, I apologize for anything that you may have taken offense to.  I absolutely do not condone that type of writing, especially on my website.  You know, it's something that I put a lot of hard work into and it's been up for two  years now. And, you know, we've we've put a lot of energy and a lot of money into it  to make it something to be proud of.  And for something like that to be on, it's a black eye to the black eye to the site.  And it's a black eye to me. 
[149:00]
 And, you know, I apologize to you and Jacqueline and, you know, anybody else from the  WWF who if somebody had made a comment like that to them, then they will absolutely be  gone.  You mean African-Americans?  All right. Enough with that.  Wow. Boy, that sure turned around quick.  Look at that. What the hell are you doing?  So what else, guys? Let's wrap this up.  Yeah, no problem.  Ah, ah, ah, god damn it. 
[149:30]
 You ruined our interview with the rock.  Well, we were all having fun.  All right. Well, we still want to thank you for coming by.  I appreciate it. Yeah.  All right. Absolutely.  I hope you don't hate us.  Well, no, I mean, if you know this and if you tell them the truth, if you know this.  I'm giving you my word. You don't know much about me, but I honestly have never read  anything like that on this website.  And that is my my word.  Not backing down or anything. 
[150:00]
 I've never read anything like that.  That's the God's honest truth.  I believe it's there. I'm not going to lie.  But, you know, if you say it's there, but I was pretty much there, you know, for the  most part again, I was bought aware, bought my attention last night, sat on phone for  a good couple of hours and made the publicist aware.  And I had no idea.  It was him. But I appreciate you guys have me on.  Thank you. OK.  Book signings starting at seven tonight.  Tower Records East Fourth Street and Lafayette in the East Village.  Got to thank the Rock for stepping on by today. 
[150:30]
 I can't even believe these ones.  He's a disgusting little man.  What a huge bag.  Train wreck radio.  Bang on, bro.  This is sicker than faces of death.  One, two, seven, W, N, E, W.  One, two, seven, W, N, E, W.  Who the hell just turned off their radio?  Hey, once again, it's Opie and Anthony.  Jeffrey Ross still in the studio.  I don't know if he wants to be associated with us anymore, but 
[151:00]
 oh, my God, it's crazy.  That was cringe radio at its best.  Jeffrey Ross playing Caroline's tonight and all weekend long called Caroline's for tickets.  But he is. Thanks for having me on.  He will be there.  He will be there tonight at eight.  Holy, it might. I am like shaking.  Flip from a awesomeness on instant feedback.  Never have I heard your show come to such a screeching home.  Nice way to kill an interview, sick boy.  Wow. That was some of the most uncomfortable radio I have ever heard for sick boy. 
[151:30]
 Send all complaints to W.D.B.  at X Wrestling dot com.  What's the dude? He's the guy you want.  All right. Thanks.  Oh, my God.  He just ran right out of here, didn't he?  Uh, yeah, he walked right out.  I swear to God, it was like a train hit me heading out the door.  So I got hit by the crash.  Oh, it was just wow.  You know, and he was having such a good time. 
[152:00]
 He was going to cut like liners for a show and he saw the white devil.  And there was a wow, there was a bunch of people out there waiting to get pictures  and autographs and he just push right through the crowd.  He said goodbye to me.  Yeah, he shook my hand.  I said nice to meet you.  Oh, we didn't get a handshaker and nothing.  No, he just turned his.  I you know what?  All of a sudden, Donna.  Yes, I'm here. What's up?  I very, very uncomfortable.  Did he even leave? I mean, was it cordial or is he did he shake me with his hand  walking out or no, when I was given the plug for the book in the book signing, 
[152:30]
 he just turned right around and walked right out.  When shake her hand, nothing.  Very, very uncomfortable.  I swear I feel bad for Jeffrey Ross.  He shook Jeffrey's hand.  That was about it.  I very, very odd.  How that happened.  Wow.  You know, I'm not going to.  What we had no idea what was on the X wrestling dot com site.  No clue whatsoever.  And I know as he's walking out, he thinks, you know, we we knew all along what was on there. 
[153:00]
 You know, I say good for him because he had a lot of class in a very uncomfortable situation.  He didn't.  He didn't. You know, he had to do what he has to do.  Well, not to tell you the truth.  Yeah. On one hand.  Sure. You're right.  The way he handled sick boy.  But I don't know.  Because sick boy is on this show.  I think he kind of looped us into this whole thing.  And the interview fell apart.  I think he feels that we are in some way involved with the website and with you didn't make 
[153:30]
 any clear that he might find objectionable.  I think I made it clear.  I don't think so.  I still didn't know when he left.  If you look at the website, it looks like you guys are involved with the website.  That is that portion.  How does it look like that?  If you look at if you look at that portion of it, it looks like you guys said this stuff  that we personally said.  Yeah, it makes you guys sound.  It makes it sound if you read it and it's taken out of if people just read lines off. 
[154:00]
 What is it? A mock interview?  A mock interview.  It's a mock interview that was done yesterday.  And I just I just want the point to be made clear in case anybody I didn't write it.  It is on XWrestling.com, which is my site.  But I had no idea what to do.  Stop plugging your website and go home and delete that thing.  Don't worry about it.  What's your problem?  It's OK.  I'm just pissed because he left here thinking that, you know, we had everything to do with that.  We didn't. 
[154:30]
 We know that.  We get in enough trouble on our own.  I don't need people accusing us for stuff that we didn't do and we didn't do anything.  We're completely innocent.  As far as he is concerned, having Sickboy on our show, we are involved.  And in that case, he's right that we do have him on the show.  We're not involved with the website.  We're not involved in any other way.  But I think him knowing that we have him on our show is enough that it pissed them off.  He must be very sensitive when it comes to racial stuff. 
[155:00]
 He entertains kids.  He's got to mean.  Need another beer.  Can we light up the Cubans again?  You want to burn Cubans?  What?  Hey, who's this?  Is that a train?  Danny.  Huh?  Danny, what's going on?  Not much.  I just wanted to call in.  I think the way he left was kind of messed up, you know, because all you guys did was  phrase him the whole time. 
[155:30]
 And you know, he just turned his back on you real cold hearted.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm starting to get a little pissed off now that I'm thinking about this and now that  he's gone.  I mean, does he have a problem with the Godfather when the Godfather comes out pimping  hoes 24-7 and smoking joints and stuff?  That seems to be a racial stereotype.  The whole thing is, though, you know, like you guys may have so high up on the show,  and they just turned it around because he reads something on the website that had no 
[156:00]
 control over you or the station, you know?  Yeah.  And it's just, it's foul, you know?  I mean, you guys die on the line, you phrase them up, and you know, he just walked down  like a real jerk off.  Yeah, I have so many things going on in my head right now.  It's like he said he spent two hours on the phone about this last night.  Yeah.  So he should have brought it up as soon as he walked in the door.  Because wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, because if it looks like it's a mock interview that  we did with The Rock, so obviously it looks like we're associated with what was said on 
[156:30]
 XWrestling.com, he should have, you know, confronted us as soon as he walked in the  door.  I read that post, and it's obvious, it says it at the beginning, it's a fake mock fantasy  interview.  You would have to be a complete buffoon to think that that was real.  Yeah, I think that-  Even if he did have a bone to pick with you guys, he should have brought it up right when  he got there, you know, and just made his point.  He didn't know-  Since walking in and, you know, when you got into a bear trap. 
[157:00]
 I gotta say, and I've been doing a lot of radio, this has been the most uncomfortable  moment in the history of my damn radio career.  That's insane.  Oh!  When Sam was on the phone with my mom, no?  Uh, that's second at this point, Ant.  What's this?  The thing that really bugged me was the fact that if they were looking at that for two  hours last night, nobody took the time to just, you know, from one of his representatives  to just send me an email and say-  Oh, the representatives-  Oh, they'll probably be getting an email.  Oh, you're going to get an email.  I wouldn't worry about that. 
[157:30]
 All right, that's all right.  They probably can't get on your site right now.  It's probably being found.  So, Jeffrey, what was going on in your mind?  Oh, really?  Because you were the closest to him.  You were like two and a half feet away.  Jeffrey, I think he told me before when we were in break, he said, if we were involved  with that, Jeffrey's leaving now.  He's very annoyed and angry at this whole thing.  No, it was like, you know, I'm in here, you know, playing around with him.  He's having fun.  And all of a sudden, he really, it really meant a lot to him.  And I don't know.  I respect that.  I respect him for being forceful and clear. 
[158:00]
 I had no idea that was up there.  No idea.  And even if it's a fake thing, even if it's clearly a fake thing, it still shouldn't be  up there.  I mean, the kids are looking at it.  I don't have kids, but if I did, I'd be pretty pissed.  Right.  See, now I'm on the end of the spectrum where I say if it's the internet, anything goes.  I say anything goes.  It's the First Amendment, man.  I don't care what it says. 
[158:30]
 But fine, he's still got to do what he did.  OK, that's fine.  He wasn't arguing the First Amendment.  He was saying you're a prick and you're a racist if you let that be your website.  I was an innocent bystander, and that's what pisses me off.  I had no idea.  And like he dissed us at the end of the interview, I had no freaking clue, and that's what's  pissing me off.  I had no idea.  I told him man to man.  I had no idea about what he was talking about.  I was trying to be clear without coming across like we're totally separating ourselves from  SickBoy.  He's never been here before. 
[159:00]
 I don't know what the site is at all.  I didn't want to go that route, but I wanted him to know that, no, we don't know or condone  anything that is on his website.  And if you look on his website at the bottom, it says the person that runs his website does  not necessarily agree with what's posted here or anything.  And I can't remember the damn thing 24 hours a day, which is a real problem when you've  got 15 guys writing a world, you know, chomping at the bit to try and be funny.  And then somebody does something that pisses off the rock. 
[159:30]
 I get the heat for it, and then you guys get blown off.  When you have an open forum on the Internet or in books or magazines or anything, it's  good.  Sometimes that happens.  Well, look at what happened with the New York radio message board.  Yeah.  Hey, Bob.  And the zillions of people that...  What's up, Bob?  Exactly.  Say that thing.  I thought you guys were dead.  I'm not making a joke.  I was driving home.  I skidded my truck and I turned up the radio.  I pulled right off the road.  I said these guys are dead. 
[160:00]
 Yeah.  Dale from Manhattan wants to know, are you guys cleaning out your shorts and hosing off  the chairs?  You know, it was very real, though, what he was saying and feeling.  Yeah, that was...  But I don't think he understood that...  You see, he thought that you guys were associated with SickBoy, like you had something to do  with his website.  Right.  It's not like he came...  As soon as he found out that SickBoy was there, because he said, oh, oh, he said, I saw you  outside and I didn't know that you were SickBoy.  Right.  So as soon as he found out that he was SickBoy, that's when he went, no pun intended, ape. 
[160:30]
 All right.  You know what you should have done?  What?  Not you.  Like right when he said that, you should have went, oh yeah, well I'm telling you, Rock.  You know, like get into character.  Yeah, because I wasn't close enough to get my ass kicked there, Ann.  SickBoy, you should have seen your face, man.  Classic.  I could feel it.  I could feel the look on my face.  I'm like, there is no blood in my face right now.  The Rock is like a couple of feet away from you.  A couple of feet, like inches or something away from me. 
[161:00]
 I looked at his eyes, I'm like, well, I'm getting my ass kicked tonight.  Well, that would have been your fight club.  But it would have been by the Rock, man.  Yeah, that's real.  That would have been Rick's fight club.  I'm trying to think what's the move if he starts his pummeling here.  There's no move.  There's no move.  You just let him hit you.  You're sitting and watch.  Get the hell out of the way.  Yeah.  All right, Bob, thank you.  You guys would have been safe, because you have Spazz, the pro wrestler in the studio.  Yes, Spazz could have laid some moves on him.  He could have laid the, I don't want to say, bye. 
[161:30]
 All right, thank you.  Oh my God.  Hey, Chuck, you're next.  What's going on?  Yo, I can smell what was in your pants.  You know that?  Wow.  Damn.  I'll tell you something.  I don't give a damn who you have on.  Anybody that comes on the ONA show from now on, my ears are glued to the radio.  I don't give a damn who it is.  It was still good.  I'll tell you something.  Your boy, sick boy, this is what got him.  He was like, oh, it's only the same thing that goes here on this show. 
[162:00]
 I know what that killed him.  And that came out to be the wrong guy.  That's what did it, baby.  Chuck's a black guy.  Not that it matters, but.  Apparently, he doesn't know me very well.  I'll tell you one thing.  Joke time was over real fast.  It was like, poof.  Oh, man.  I'm going to tell you something.  It was brutal, but it was still good, man.  And you know what?  You guys handled it very well.  You know what I mean?  You handled it as best as you could.  You stood by the fact that you told the truth.  You stood by your boy, sick boy, who, by the way, 
[162:30]
 what's the worst kind of advice ever?  Getting the character.  He'd have been dead boy.  Never been made for now.  You know what I mean?  But you did the best thing you could.  You stood by the fact that, hey, look, this guy,  we're associated with him, but not in the way that you think.  And that's the truth.  And what can we do about it?  You know what I mean?  Now, later on, Hank, it's still good radio.  What the hell?  Thank you, Chuck.  I'm going to work.  Oh, my God.  No one wants to hang with us anymore.  That's it.  It's over.  That's not true.  I know. 
[163:00]
 Oh, man.  I had a great time.  This is the best time.  That's it?  That time was fun, too.  It was a jumble.  You're always here for some highlight.  I know.  Really?  Last time, it was pretty crazy, too.  All right.  We'll say goodbye to Jeffrey Ross, everyone.  Night, Jeffrey.  It's going to be at Carolinians tonight through Sunday.  Very funny, man.  Go see him at Carolinians.  8 o'clock show tonight, 8 o'clock show tomorrow night, 8 o'clock show Saturday.  We'll see you there.  We'll see you there.  A couple of 1030 shows thrown in there Friday and Saturday as well.  Come drink, laugh.  All right.  Jeffrey Ross, everyone.  Congratulations on another stellar day of radio. 
[163:30]
 A banner day of radio.  That was fascinating.  Brian, you can cut the tension.  You know what's cool?  Hold on one sec.  The Rocks are hypocrites.  Hold on.  Why is he hypocrites?  Why?  Remember when DX did a little skit on The Nation and they all dressed up in black?  Yeah.  I don't know about that man.  I wouldn't let that bother you.  You guys froze though, though.  You guys are a bunch of persons.  What are we going to do?  Get your narrow ass in here, Brian, and have the Rocks scare you down.  And what are you going to say?  I'd be a pushy.  What are you going to get all bad? 
[164:00]
 I'd be a pushy.  We tried to make our point as best we could, the Rocks were hypocrites.  as well  best as we could  without uh... getting in any more past  you didn't see other rocks baby and let me know what it is like an attack on  i wait and let me give you a little more information he was not going to listen  to anything we said it was past that  he just wanted out of the studio he knew we are still live on the air he just  wanted out  i have a good for crypto man she did not have bothered him 
[164:30]
 alright later on thank you  who was a jeffrey you know that uh... he forget forget the context of it all  setting that was watching him get mad  from two feet away  uh... even though he's an entertainer he's he didn't would make contact with  sick boy he knew  for zone had yet a look the other way as he would  well there's some stories in his book that he has a temper  is a rage issue that's great all because i was all my god i want a fire no you 
[165:00]
 didn't know that i've been doing all i've been doing a little research on the  right is up and he yes he admits he has a rage issue so when this whole thing  was going down i i was just panicking on someone on my god and he has to two  fifty i'm trying to find something to hide under  i'm no small guy but the rocks like six five six six a guy's gotta be two eighty  and nothing but my song like  he looked over at me once  i saw the look in his eyes and i'd jesus christ and i thought it was a wrong i 
[165:30]
 state in bed today i thought you were gone  uh...  thank you  we should have a good  yet and i got a grab my book  uh... in your own blood yes  and  so what's up  camera kit  live whatever wherever you are taking his uh...  all day uh... i'd like to have  i think that the uh... the rock uh...  ambushed you guys do it coming in and i had a responsibility to pay at the 
[166:00]
 upfront  i think i'll  uh... i don't know what i your own you were there  commenting on earlier  i'm very i'm very suspicious because if you knew all this coming into our studio  he had  he had a a feeling that we might be associated with all that and i i wish  you would have said something up front  they have to be cleared up front and before you guys got on the air  and that should that  to show should not have come to the street you all that it did all right  so i wanted to thank you  i'm afraid to go to the grand opening of uh... manna that restaurant can and 
[166:30]
 what's going on  you know what happened to you  all right what's up  but i thought it was on the rock side  that's okay  because uh...  i mean i think you guys do that i know you have to do that website  but it was obviously uh... he knew nothing about  so it was even there when he walked in because he was forced around you guys  joking around  but uh...  which will call it from  the way that and we are kind of weaker to get back again really a point across 
[167:00]
 that you are interested with the website can and he was he wasn't going to be a  had to see his face he wasn't going to listen to anything we had to say he  wanted out really like area i apologize man-to-man as best i could  and says he went to commercials usually  you know we take pictures with uh... our gas you know we shake it shake a hand  or two we laugh you know  and he had been on usually go out in the hallway and they take pictures with  some of our listeners that came down  and uh... you know then if they're they're really cool bill bill cuts and  liners for our radio show 
[167:30]
 what happened was as we get that commercial he turned around and walked  out  really i'm saying by  so he was in a listen to anything on this if we would have made it clear that  we're not involved with the website we've gotten twenty thousand phone calls  and emails gone you guys sold sick boy down the river you bunch of pussies you  made it sound like you were backpedaling so  there's really nothing you could do what i would say  or say that they got your point on it and i would have to do the same thing but  with the article what they were so much the website but the article that uh...  got about this topic right first of all the guy runs a website has writers on it 
[168:00]
 if a writer writes something inappropriate  not only is the guy that runs the website  maybe he doesn't know it's there  but then  uh... remove it to the radio station that he comes up to every so often  i mean it's obvious we're not involved with the website  and uh... with the weather we have to explain that to the rock live on the air  as he's pissed  is another story i don't think we had to and what i think at that point he was  pissed  and he was leaving right already made up his mind in his head 
[168:30]
 and we were going to talk about it  we can babysit everyone that is associated with the show we don't know  what everyone does people come in the door all the time they got things they  got products they got websites what are we supposed to look at everything and  make sure everything's uh...  milt post the right  before we go we put them on the air now it's not what the show is about  i'm adam bates an open forum and there are first amendment rights that are  protected  he he he he he had an open forum on the internet 
[169:00]
 i think that it's not the first amendment  it's like a big u n and i don't know his personal not that that's fine that he  has every right to get up and leave  but we we should have to have backpedal or anything sorry i picked up the rock  he has his own agenda that's fine i don't know i i i respect what he had to  say and stuff but if uh... if he had any inkling that we were so sure with uh...  you know this before he came into the studio then yes i am pissed and he  didn't like say it up front  i think it'd be a more pissed if you know that the guy who wrote that 
[169:30]
 richard from magazine now  home not anymore  not anymore  uh... he's no longer going to be ready for my side and  barren dandy that i can't thank you if i thought they can't go alright my  how this is all anyone wants to talk about but it's pretty intense  but pretty intense three minutes the what's up  and i do think the rock is a total  and is a real jerk  two minutes earlier  only talking about it when he wants to be a bad guy and all you gotta do is call

 uh...  at that point and i don't know if the show and nothing to do with you and i i  was just man-to-man  telling him  in his eyes  i had no  freaking clue about what he was talking about  and that's why i'm mad because you died  it didn't matter his mind was made up that's it  non  so  and and i said he had heard of the website on my i got a feeling that  they're good thing  uh... on his face he turned around he kind of 
[174:00]
 he did that's not being yet and i see him there in the right over on the ball  here this is a story thing he kind of looked over sideways  i'd always a real real fast  uh... yeah i thought i was going to cry  when when he was talking to you i felt that you people stopped cursing i'm  sorry my bad i'm really so far but i mean it's like  i felt really bad for you guys i really thought that  he was going to like punch you guys in the face for that  we're all bombed and stuff too because we really like uh... we like the rock 
[174:30]
 it was so cool  we had a really good relationship or did with the dog  you meet your hero and all of a sudden like he and now we're scourging  they're probably pulling the raw magazine off the newsstand as we speak  i'm sorry i don't know if you're going to be  me and my friends are sitting around looking at the wrong magazine  and we can swear to god for a little bit if you look really fashion like  earnest p. warrell  uh... 
[175:00]
 is that  and i think it's a good idea  you must really be looking closely  i'm sorry but i don't think i don't think you're really sorry about it  we've also got a bit  doctor bellows impression but it was  hi  but i never saw  what  td  what  but you  but he said  but you  and it was over but but we never knew but but but but but but sick boys 
[175:30]
 and then he said  it was never  but we don't even know sick boy  written medicine because we don't even know why he's here  uh... we got to break we are so  i got a lot of phone calls in just a bit stay there  okay  you guys  it's me  one  seven w any w  and he's back into the world's strongest  as our good friends at stacker to  home let's let's welcome them back to the open at the show at the for the new 
[176:00]
 millennium for the new millennium is right  stacker to has been here uh... system beginning on the open at the show we  appreciate that lots of our listeners have lost a lot of weight with stacker  to stacker to the world's strongest fat burner it burns the fat  it uh...  crushes the cravings in between meals one more and it gives you the boost of  energy yes you need when you're lacking weight in the day like like uh... we are  uh... if you want to get up for yourself and staggered to the world's  strongest fat burner  they have a website everyone has a website these days w w w dot stacker to 
[176:30]
 dot com he thinks on the stacker to website at  checks there are checks on the site other i went there yet girls that have  lost uh... weight using stacker okay  in like the keenest of i'd stacker to the world's strongest fat burner  give them a call one eight hundred light line that's one eight hundred l i t e  l i n a stacker to the world's strongest fat burner  seven w a double-dose of the answer  and 
[177:00]
 just got the people's brush off  you know we cannot  stay out of trouble  we try i thought today would be the day we just have a boring opiate anthony  show  a little interview with the rock  then we go you know that uh... by zano or something  but no  this somehow we're always ending up in some form of trouble  it was all fake and we're just gonna be part of a story line from the w w r  you think 
[177:30]
 yeah that must be it  that's on the little bit that i'll call you out  when the act in it  i don't think so now we know he wasn't now it would have been about to pick  to go to the grand opening uh... well we are invited by mike what's up all  a a going all right is it a big place will be a lot of people who is there  clearly right  before you to be a wrestler right now  yeah well i think the rocket expanded pan and punch you right now and broke  your lip open 
[178:00]
 and cool thank you  all right that  and any  grant what's going on a and i thought i was kind of roughly but i got to take  the rock side  six boys got to go i'm looking at this website  and that the guys rep in them  how do you expect them not to react like that  i think he has every right to react i don't know he did i just you know but  it's not your fault  you get somebody should have called sick boy right out onto the carpet 
[178:30]
 i think the rock did  what you think i think he wanted you guys to call him out onto the carpet how  do we call now we haven't seen what he's talking about  but the rocks tell you what was there all right so we have to read it for  ourselves and and and you know this could be the rocker is talking well the  rocks telling you it's there  he's like talking to third-person  uh... it's it's it's here i mean the rocks from i'm looking right at it  and uh... i i know what it if it was me i'd be pissed off too  all right he has every right to  but uh... i don't maybe you guys have somebody go check out the website and 
[179:00]
 maybe kid uh... i think everyone rock a call and say hey listen you know you're  right and uh... we don't condone it and uh... the sick boys got a lot on show  anymore i think you know i think uh... a ton of people checked it out  i think more people checked it out because the rocker mentioned it's  well yes  you know the five thousand people that would have never even seen it endorsed  by the rock  uh... i don't know i don't know if it does is the word  i i i can't be the rocks point i thought he was going a little overboard but uh... 
[179:30]
 now i had no i can i have no problem with any of that i just you know i i don't  want to keep saying it but i said man-to-man to one that had no clue and  uh...  you know it is this at the end of the interview we're having fun and and and  the truth is i had no idea  uh... maybe you guys can talk to a patch things up because their interview was  going really cool and then i think i did a great job and then at the end you know  i i assume like okay we we continue to the discussion off the air  and now he just  bolted  he left and cycle mark you're on your mind 
[180:00]
 all my god cycle mark who uh... you know it is also in charge of trying to get  some of these guests uh... to cut i'd use for us  you still want to listen and can you cut that open at the end of the day that  i don't care that the big brother that what he said what he said  no i'm not going to do you know there's also a little bit more than all that so  he's still going to be working and the w of the was revealed to  chastity of his is going to be  and maybe give uh... maybe got married to give them to call and noted  everything's really cool 
[180:30]
 you know i have been just in the show now  and i think  you guys talk  thanks and i  i mean that's ridiculous  it's like somebody getting uh...  you know put a sign up in the crowd at the w w f someone reading the sign  getting offended and being pissed off at the w w f  because there's a sign  you know i mean  this this many things he said it were very hypocritical in our interview if  you really want to get into it  now we're talking about the signs in the arena  and we asked if they even make him laugh he goes here when i see the one says big 
[181:00]
 red retard  uh...  we tried very derogatory  mentally handicapped  same where do you  do you draw the line  as far as obviously as far as the rock wants you to well as far as that type of  humor goes now where do you  can't believe sick by looking at my life  brush with the rock  almost almost uh...  by the fact that's pretty  that's pretty cool 
[181:30]
 we almost saw it we almost saw a live death that would have been a first for  everybody that would be cool if you like  put him put him in the position  to give the rock bottom  anybody's like looking around all crazy is that sick by then  one of them on the floor i'll tell you what man if there's anybody to get your  ass kicked by  it there could be none cooler than having a kick by the run around and  i mean it's as intense and a serious as the whole situation was  and i thought there's a team on the rock and was kicked my ass  uh... yeah you know but you go down the street get your ass kicked by some  nobody yet 
[182:00]
 rick has a great line here he writes we are the jennifer lopez the sick boys  party  yeah guilt by association  uh... right  well man  they tell what's going on you know what that that's all right  dot the six boys of course he am and  what i can  pick what hit marry saying like  all i don't know what's up with the side i have no idea what's on it  and then it's not the rock leaves he's like always this guy i know exactly what  you're talking about  and you know i was there for the commercial right now spaz remanded 
[182:30]
 i don't know what's on the site i don't know what's going on with it  support and say anything we can only what was on it all along more on that  was during the commercial break spaz pulled me out into the hallway and  showed me what was up on the site  was sick  with he showed you on your site yeah i don't monitor the site twenty four hours  a day i got fifteen writers who do their stuff on wrestling and centered i don't  sit in monitor them i got a business to run  yeah i know man but now you're going to take a heart you know 
[183:00]
 uh... i don't know you just got a you gotta watch that morning i know which  show came more of a screeching halt like what what what  was the seat belt airbag factor more  uh... sick boy asking rock a question or rick taking a picture of j more  michael i i i thought this show tomorrow the screeching halt not a fear factor  another that  this is more of the screeching halt back there able to smooth over the j more  thing out of the air be able to see how this one was eighty into the brick wall 
[183:30]
 that one with with rick and j was a close call but it you know i think rick  belly could have held his own with j  you know he versus the rock is just a goddamn contest there six months  since the proper  sick boy go home and get rid of them  i'm sorry i like off  uh... to matter all  another day on the open and shats what it does with the shows all about  michael what's going on  they were from that all right  and uh... hopefully you better cut out of that man-to-man stuff for a while 
[184:00]
 there  and then the man  he was about to open up a can of whip and there whatever if you want to have  me get him in there and i was gonna say what i had to say and no clue where was  sick boy do it on the kind of class something  now he was right next to the rock what you really looking very very uh...  scared that was a codec moment there no one certainly was let me paint the  picture for a seriously they were maybe a foot away from each other  here that's close maybe 
[184:30]
 may well yeah i'll be good to work what we learned that he'll be a picture  yeah i will do that in a couple minutes here  uh... peace out there  all  all my  could have done better than rock  eddie what's up  a l a how are you  i'm sorry man the rocket the big a whole  i hate him i hate it character all about him 
[185:00]
 really  i mean what can you get what you guys are going to come with undertaker something  we've had a lot of the guys like that  i don't have a really really i love your show don't get me wrong  and i just like  you know i i i i i don't like the rock point  i mean i think the big hypocrite  because i do you have to come back to you know people can not think right  uh... john what's going on 
[185:30]
 yeah i don't all right  uh... you know if we should have said that you had a uh... guest writer with  john rocker  uh... yeah  you know you're going to figure it out right there and then you would understand  well thank you  i think that my  uh... now what's up they don't get out of the most out of the best rate of  her to why you guys with that was great i was so uncomfortable my i mean i don't  call for my car i got pulled over for a speedy  i would think that i think that i was afraid to turn the dial what to do is 
[186:00]
 growing so i can imagine how you guys thought you know i i don't like those  uncomfortable moments and they happen a lot lately on the show  really do  but that i mean that really was there really got to be put up  seriously the rock i mean  he can you think it would be cool to you guys i mean he can put in he really  should get back straight before he was going on a pirate like that  to show you what kind of uh... mentality is going to get that he could have  relaxed a little bit to go  you know it's you guys are cool man and it is going to get i got a problem with  this guy should have just taken that on you guys i i i mean i think that's wrong 
[186:30]
 because support  well thank you matt  is a good point i'm just  you know we're exhausted from what just happened off  i was there with the wrong  let's take a quick break it will play the uh... the famous game  what did we learn on the open at the show today  so it's clear the phone lines again to the next okay  and  and well we'll have to that  well  i've just punched out the 
[187:00]
 six-way site  uh...  uh... i'm just kind of looking  you know it says ex-wrestling dot com is not affiliated with any pro wrestling  organizations  did you put the opening of the nation  and i would be uh...  and i would be nice  i will be back  friends eighty four years old  but you cannot have oral sex with friend i'm sorry  now and i was ok  you know 
[187:30]
 w any double u  about that  was his seven double u any double u  right between the internet  you almost saw  a murder today  one of the radio station give you that 
[188:00]
 played a lot of music  every taking a vacation day  i would have been fun  all right let's play out what did we learn on the  hoping that the show today  uh...  is against the  white  all of the i wonder why  maybe should call it w c w and say how much we like them who who who who  who  that's just a joke  uh... and what's up  you know what's going on so 
[188:30]
 i learned today that the rocker dwayne johnson everyone recall it is the big  pitch  the it's all about the time about record anymore that commercial about  promoting yourself  that they've been all to worry and hope all the more around you know that was  real that was  that was real that way  i think you know i don't think you have a you know that you know you should have  done sick boy  when you're face to face with the rock  and you're saying before i answer that question let me ask you this issue 
[189:00]
 it doesn't matter what you have to ask me  uh...  i just wanted to say simply that uh... howard and clinton  take they got the right  yeah i learned that you know i learned today i learned that open Anthony and the  rock now had a full their audience  with a big setup  but not the top guy  they are really  jesus christ think we're not smart anything that happens in here people  will think uh... is a setup you know i guess because it is just so freaking  ridiculous 
[189:30]
 whatever goes on in here  no unfortunately that was uh...  believe what you must  uh... jason real deal what's up  i don't get  man you can't almost had some  some other over there  and that's what i learned  uh... thank you i later my god i'm learning something from these calls  it's time to go home  yeah  didn't learn anything else today  on the show there's some good stuff today i pretty much canceled out the rest of 
[190:00]
 the show right there yeah chris what's going on  i learned the rock is uh... idiot on the radio too  you guys should have had bad rep home  uh... and i was as i said your hero would have uh... smooth the whole thing  over even at night don't uh... dislike uh... spas that much  and i killed  i thank you very good rock  uh... jason what's going on  and what's up guys all right  what i learned today was whoever schedules your commercials is really 
[190:30]
 warm  what commercial break after rock leaves that the promo for the upcoming wcw  effect  wasn't really i swear to god i had no clue  i swear to god i would look for a whole time thank you all right here by  tj what's going on what you learn on the show today  and i learned that you guys  almost had the last live broadcast of your life  pretty close man  uh... man when you when he left the studio he he wouldn't care if you like 
[191:00]
 the plug your budget like  sorry i don't like it thank you tj  we're sharing moments of the rock there's a picture of him with  andrea the giant holding his arms his little kid and  we got the pictures before  the problem  right i did so we'll see if you got a couple of pictures with them  uh... man uh... jeff what's going on  yeah what's up guys listen i learned from the show the rock really didn't  take a good way saying you just you know  it is opinion 
[191:30]
 got this topic that well i don't really think that uh...  so shouldn't be set on that website but you know about you guys and know about  it  i thank you jeff  no problem i'm not  uh... jerry  your next year it was up  and you're going to be  i learned today that if i go into the ball before the only show is over  i missed the best radio at a damn week  uh... you missed it  yeah i missed it  i have the kind of take the client out to put they want to go out for that i  get back in the car and i'm hearing about this i think it 
[192:00]
 it never works out jerry was the most uncomfortable three minutes of my radio  career  well she had to have a good bet you got the best i mean we're trying to like  talk to him or say anything  and he's just looking down  like this  and then he goes  let's wrap it up guys  and what it's important  uh... it  we've been asked to last hour but uh... 
[192:30]
 well you had like that i guess i got a clue that we get one vacation again  particular part of our met by that thanks you have to back i'm not  uh... jason would you learn on the show today  i learned that uh... you got a little comic they had call on from jail  both can blame for thinking that  yeah  uh... although comics written  very good man at night  ten years when you learn on the show today  guide i learned if you guys ever suffer from constipation in the future 
[193:00]
 just think back to today's show the three guys right up  yeah i guess i guess it might be a  going to some new shorts guys i think you later  uh...  tony what's going on  i come when i learned today is that the rock needs a reality check  uh... as for a professional  uh... he should uh... looking to borrow it how he's uh... acting he should know  you're there helping him plug his book and everything like that  you know if his fans are what that makes his book it will make him uh... who he 
[193:30]
 is  right at the post-op like that  you know i mean uh... as a professional  professional people handle himself a little bit better than that  just run away like that  barman thank you i think my a great instant feedback uh... some guys and  that when rock was explaining his point i should have been part of the family  yeah  uh...  party  cop  jill what's up  yeah i learned what they tell a couple days today but mostly that i i could get  disappointed in you guys  and that that you guys like sounded  spineless man 
[194:00]
 and i was really disappointed how many grew up in new york you should have  set up the cell phone  and another guy the big guy but what you do beat the crap out of like i said i  got a listen to the tape because i thought we actually uh... told him what  was going on  and joe what you have a different control your voice so you say we were  stuttering you sound like you guys are scared i think  at all right it was so uncomfortable in here you you got what what are we  supposed to do  jill's all the sudden they were not going to be the crap out of the old 
[194:30]
 mom we were blindsided  first of all  all right and we didn't know what to say  because we don't even know what is i swear to you on the same thing i had  i had no clue what he was talking about  uh... i still love you guys that will be on whatever that's fine it's gonna  happen on this show you know what i mean but uh... i i'd  freaking had no clue what he was talking about  if you were here it was very obvious he didn't want to listen to anything we had  to say at that point  they are going to have a  but that would have made that 
[195:00]
 it really not a friend of the show  i'm sorry that  one last call we get out of here uh... if you do damn if you don't out by jim  thank god you're the final call of the radio show today what's going on  not the much open  just learned what the true meaning of train wreck radio is that if that wasn't  hard stopping to listen to you to get real like that  uh...  i think that would be the two biggest bags and a radio you know you sick 
[195:30]
 bastard you guys enjoyed it is that  here is the best it made me sick to my stomach to listen to you guys  or more we were dying and i gotta hear the tape  uh... two of you started a little bit of a bit of a but i don't know that i don't  know that it was just  well  and sick boy oh my god i hope you guys enjoyed it uh... loved every minute of it  you guys are arjun thank you  you know the play the last uh... like twenty seconds of that interview instead  of a train next time  i'm leaving
