<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in their characteristically vulgar and sexually suggestive banter.  This included a debate over the color of Anthony's shirt (described with various offensive terms),  Opie's complaints about the increased pedestrian traffic due to warm weather, and a graphic description of a homeless man's bowel movements. Opie also mentioned switching from rollerblading to driving due to the heat.  The conversation then shifted to plans for their new studio, specifically the possibility of incorporating a stripper pole, and a discussion about the preferred behavior of strippers in the studio setting.

The show continued with details of their "Assault on the Media" segment, which involved ambushing news reporters with a sign promoting their show.  They recounted a successful ambush during a rape story report, highlighting the reporter’s flustered response and the news station's swift editing.  A caller suggested they avoid targeting George W. Bush.  The hosts also discussed the new Pioneer portable satellite radio and XM's marketing strategy.  This segment included listener-submitted jingles, audio from the "Assault on the Media" segment, a listener-created song parody ("Broke My Knee, Man"), and a call from a disappointed broadcasting school graduate, leading to a discussion about the broadcasting industry and the relative importance of formal education versus practical experience and connections.  The segment concluded abruptly due to phone line failure.

The next segment focused heavily on listener calls detailing negative experiences with college courses, including absurd electives and useless classes.  The hosts also discussed the absurdity of broadcasting school advice, using a caller’s anecdote about a radio personality using a forced, unnatural voice as an example.  The segment included more crude listener jingles, leading to a discussion about their show's style compared to a "morning zoo" format, sparked by a comment from Sonny Fox (clarified to be a different Sonny Fox than the children's show host).  A significant portion featured a discussion of Ann Bancroft's career, interspersed with audio clips, followed by a critique of a new "Honeymooners" movie trailer.  The segment further delved into speculation about Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes' relationship and Scientology, including a caller’s anecdote about a listener-driven stunt involving bandanas on cars.  A silent guest, "Ziggy," was present but did not participate.  The segment featured extensive use of offensive language and discussed sexually suggestive and potentially offensive topics.

The following segment centered on Sid Rosenberg's firing from Imus' show, focusing on Rosenberg's controversial comments about Kylie Minogue and Tom Cruise,  which were replayed.  The hosts debated the context of these remarks and the differences between their show and Imus'.  The discussion then returned to Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, analyzing their relationship with humor and cynicism, including clips of Holmes expressing her affection for Cruise.  The hosts speculated about Scientology's influence on Holmes. A lengthy, absurd debate about the color of Anthony's shirt ensued. A bizarre news story about a human leg falling from a plane was discussed and played, along with a brief mention of a shark attack.  Caller Ben Sparks jokingly blamed Arnold Schwarzenegger's *Commando* for inspiring the plane stowaway.  Tony Raimondo from *Sink Magazine* joined the show, promoting the magazine's content, including their comparison of satellite radio providers and an article about women using technology to catch cheating partners. The conversation explored the pervasiveness of technology in relationships and the digital traces people leave.

The penultimate segment focused on the vulnerability of personal information stored on computers, citing examples of infidelity discovered through computer access and the dangers of phishing scams.  Anthony discussed his success in online poker, including strategies like using a female screen name. Concerns about cheating in online poker were also addressed.  Tony Romando (from *NSYNC Magazine*, not *Sink Magazine*) was a guest, promoting the magazine and discussing gadgets and mobile phones.  Callers shared their experiences with computer-related mishaps, scams, and discoveries of infidelity, including one about disturbing content on a used computer and another about a handicapped woman's pornography collection.  The segment concluded with a discussion of various scams and baseball, specifically the New York Mets and Yankees.

The final segment concentrated on a detailed critique of the New York Yankees' performance, focusing on specific players like Jason Giambi, Mike Mussina, and Randy Johnson.  The hosts also discussed the team's trade for Johnson, George Steinbrenner's potential dissatisfaction with Joe Torre, and the team's overall management.  Barry Bonds' situation with the Giants was analyzed, focusing on his off-field issues.  Mariano Rivera's declining performance and Roger Clemens' future were discussed.  The Astros' struggles were briefly mentioned.  The hosts also touched upon the changing dynamics of baseball, comparing past pitchers like Cy Young and Bob Gibson to modern relievers.  The segment included a call from Rob Dibble, who recounted a bet involving a Japanese tattoo and running through Times Square in a thong.  Other calls involved listener questions about various players and teams,  including a humorous exchange about watching pornography with dogs.  The segment concluded with promotion of Dibble's show.

[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  It's terrible.  We will be in the end of the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  You're a beast. 
[00:04:30]  You're a beast.  Come on, bark like a dog for me.  Come on, bark like a dog for me.  Come on, bark like a dog.  I will teach you the meaning of the word of respect.  You're a kid's hotcher.  You're a filthy whore.  It's in the hole.  It's in the hole. 
[00:05:00]  The last time I saw a mouth like that, I had a hook.  Hey, I should have stayed home and played with myself.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  Yay.  Yay.  We're all going to get laid.  Okay.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Thanks, Joey.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[00:05:30]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Hey, what's happening, man?  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  Good morning to you.  On this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, already 80 degrees in New York City.  Wow kind of day out there.  It sure is, Anthony.  It sure is.  We should bitch that it's too hot.  It's like, oh, I can't take this heat.  Jeez.  After all winter of complaining. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, I know it.  Oh, I knew it.  I could tell by Jimmy's look.  Well, Anthony's wearing...  I knew it.  Anthony's wearing very bright colors today.  Yeah.  I have a lovely shirt on.  It is blue.  That's not blue.  It's blue and it's...  Hold on, Jimmy.  What color is that?  That's not blue.  I would say if it's in the blue family, but it's more of a baby blue.  It's more of a sky blue.  I don't know if that's even sky blue. 
[00:06:30]  And it's very colorful.  I think it's more of a grayish blue.  Striped.  It's more of a faggy blue.  That's positive blue.  This is a very nice shirt.  It's summery.  It's lavender.  It's not lavender.  That's lavender.  It is absolutely not lavender.  Let's take a poll.  Is that lavender, Jimmy?  That actually is not a bad call.  I mean, a lavender definitely could... 
[00:07:00]  Lavender?  There's a label you could peg on that shirt there.  Lavender is purple.  This is blue.  That's not blue.  I must be colorblind then.  Some seafoam green.  Yeah.  And then some type of peach.  Peach.  Stripes.  Lavender.  But it's lime green.  I say blue.  Peach.  You say lavender.  I say blue.  See how different it could sound?  Same shirt.  I say it's lavender.  Lime green. 
[00:07:30]  And peach.  It's more a seafoam green.  Seafoam?  It's a nice shirt.  It's summery.  It's light.  It's festive.  When's your tee time?  When's your tee time?  When are you teeing off?  740?  Yeah.  That's it?  Oh, my God.  A little goth.  Without the elf.  Okay, Pookie.  I don't know what happened.  I got a porn shirt on with ripped jeans, and you look like you're ready to play golf.  Wow.  It's summer out. 
[00:08:00]  I'm celebrating the summer.  The nice warm weather that we finally got here in New York.  Just so long.  I'm kind of...  We turn pretty quickly here on the show, and I know we were bitching about how it was dark  out when we came into work, and freezing cold, and I'm kind of missing that a little  bit.  Because now with the nicer weather, it brings more people out.  And for someone like me, who is a people hater, I really don't like the company in the morning. 
[00:08:30]  I used to...  When I used to walk from the garage to the studio here, remember, there was nobody.  Yeah.  I would walk around and look behind my...  I'd look behind me and be like, uh-oh, the homeless guy is asleep in the corner.  Okay, I got him.  You know, I know where he is.  And that was it.  And I would walk, and sometimes it's snowing, and sometimes it's just freezing cold.  It's pitch black.  And there would be nobody, nobody on the street.  I cannot, for the life of me, figure out where these people are coming from. 
[00:09:00]  It's not like they told their boss, I won't come to work in the cold or the dark.  You're not going to have me until summer.  Because it's the same time as it was in the winter, but I was alone.  And now at the same time...  People are just more motivated when it's lighter out.  You can't be more motivated to what?  Go to work?  Get up.  People have jobs.  They either have jobs, or they don't have jobs.  Do they not go to work in the winter?  Anthony, no one sleeps.  When it's this hot, no one really sleeps, unless you're fortunate enough to have the 
[00:09:30]  really good A.C. happening.  Opie, you have to be...  Let's say you have to be to work at 6 o'clock.  They're exercising.  They're doing errands.  But they're out.  No!  They're going to work.  They're coming out of the subway.  Oh, you see them going to work.  You can tell they're on their way to work.  Maybe they're going to work early, so they can get out early and enjoy the summer.  You think?  Mm-hmm.  Maybe.  All I know is no one on the street in the winter.  Now, all of a sudden, same time, same time of day, packed. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  Crowded.  There's people working.  There's construction guys out there.  Uh, everyone's working.  And now, they're all in my way, and they're all annoying the shit out of me.  They all smell bad.  The homeless guy, uh, yesterday, I'm walking, he's pissing on a mailbox.  He just got his dick out, and he's pissing on the mailbox.  Like, you know, it's all nice and stuff to think that the homeless are just regular people 
[00:10:30]  without homes, but they're insane animals that, that just don't fit into society.  I love that.  He's pissing on the mailbox.  I love that.  I, uh, went to your garage the other day, and you pointed out the, uh, the homeless dump.  The homeless shit.  And I've been watching it decompose for about three months now.  It's just turning into brown flakes now that are kind of welded together.  Uh, when, when I first saw it, it was a, a one foot long log. 
[00:11:00]  Just a log sitting there.  And it, it's in a corner.  So you could tell the guy propped himself in the corner and took the dump.  It's not a doggy dump.  It's a human dump.  And, uh, every day as I walked by, I watched more moisture leave it.  And it became this, uh, this, um, sausage, this dried out sausage looking thing.  And now it's starting to collapse on itself and becoming flat.  That's too bad you didn't, you know, take a picture every day.  I should have taken a photo every day and just done this, um, time lapse. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, made it on a website or something.  Watch the homeless guy's shit decompose.  We're having a deep conversation and then it goes, oh, by the way, that's the homeless, uh, crap.  That's the homeless guy shit I watched every day.  I'm like, wow, our lives really do stink.  That's what we do.  Oh, you gotta find your entertainment on the way to and from the studio on a daily basis.  And you've noticed my new problem, right?  Uh, it's getting too warm for you to roll a blade, isn't it?  Yes.  Or for you to, uh, skateboard.  Oh, hey, cause I'm trying to act young and youthful. 
[00:12:00]  Skateboarding.  Oh, good golly.  Um, no, it's the easiest way to get to work.  You just, uh, throw on some blades and you cut across the park.  Yeah.  And it's like five minutes.  Boom, I'm, I'm at work.  But, uh.  Oh, please.  It's already 80 degrees out.  It's six in the morning and what have you.  And, uh, I come to work just completely drenched in sweat.  Like Louie Anderson sweat.  It's just like, you're pumping it out.  All soaked.  I come in, say hi to everyone, and then I gotta, like, dab down all the sweat. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, and wiping your head off.  Oh, whoosh.  And I don't, I really don't sweat.  But it's that hot.  No, you do rollerblading in.  No, it's that hot out there.  I, I think we gotta build a shower in here.  Is that what we're gonna need once, uh, everybody leaves?  When are we gonna start the blueprints for the new joint?  Yeah, what the hell?  Hey, man.  Let's bring someone in and start the planning so we can get this done in two years.  Anthony and I, we're at the new facility.  It's there.  It's ready to go.  I saw the studios.  There's no reason for anyone to be in here anymore.  None whatsoever.  Get them out of here.  Let's go.  We got things to build. 
[00:13:00]  We want to build a.  We got cubicles to take out and a stage to put in.  We want to, uh, build a stage, right, so we could, uh, have comedians perform and maybe  actually bands.  Bands.  And then, uh, we also want an area which is just couches so we can do the first break kind  of with our feet up.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  With our coffee and our newspapers just kind of getting the show going.  Hanging out in, like, a little living room atmosphere.  I think the stage should also have a pole.  Now, this way, when dopey-ass stupid strippers come in, instead of sitting here in the studio,  they can do what they do. 
[00:13:30]  On the pole.  On a stage.  And, and, you know something?  I thought we went with a, uh, no stripper zone here.  I, I agree.  Until things change.  Perhaps a stage with a pole and some lighting might actually change things.  And then, if we're all hanging out, we could do the show, the stripper could be dancing  on the pole.  And you know how it is at the club, at the strip club?  You hang out, you talk to your friends.  You occasionally take the glance up at the, uh, stage, watching the stripper.  And it's not like the stripper is sitting there in your conversation. 
[00:14:00]  See, that's where we got into a problem, Hopi.  We've invited the dopey, stupid strippers into our conversation.  Into our environment.  At the club, you don't invite them to your seat.  Right.  To talk with your friends.  Right.  Stay on the stage.  Dance on the pole.  We'll occasionally glance at you.  That's how a stripper should be used.  Strippers should walk into the studio completely naked.  Right.  Or close to it.  Like they do, uh, on the stage.  That's the mistake we made.  That's the mistake.  They come in here fully clothed and expect to have a conversation. 
[00:14:30]  You're not here to have a conversation.  You don't treat them like that in the club.  Why should we treat them like that here at the studio?  They should be naked and dancing.  We should be talking amongst ourselves.  They should shut up.  Bravo.  And, uh, you know, then we'll toss them a couple of bucks.  Bravo.  And then when Jimmy's getting his lap dances, I'll be the one, you know, kind of, you know,  taking a peek.  Take a peek?  Take a peek at his lap dance so I don't have to spend the money.  You kind of hone in on someone else's lap dance.  Isn't it great when someone, and it's good when it's a friend of yours, but it's even 
[00:15:00]  better when it's someone you have no clue, you don't even know who they are, and they  paid money for lap dance, they happen to sit down close to you, and now you look over  and go, I'm getting his lap dance.  When I didn't have a lot of money, I'd go to the strip clubs, and I would sit right  next to the fat dope in the business suit.  The guy, the sap.  Yeah.  The mark.  Whatever the strippers call these guys, I would sit next to them knowing they're going to  have at least, you know, five or six lap dances while I'm there, and I'm sitting right next  to the guy, so she might as well be, you know, doing it for me. 
[00:15:30]  You're going to look.  All you're doing is turning your head.  It's right there.  Six, eight inches away, what have you.  A foot away, whatever.  Twenty bucks for you, free for me.  Thanks.  That's right.  Thanks.  I get the same thing.  That's right.  No touching.  Let's go to Seth in Boston.  Hey, Seth, what's going on today?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hello, Seth.  Anthony, I know that you have, you know, your issues with color, but I'm wondering, actually,  I should ask Opie, is Anthony wearing an ascot, or is Anthony trying to call that a scoff? 
[00:16:00]  An ascot.  This isn't really ascot wear, sir.  It's a nice, cushy, summery shirt.  It is not lavender.  I know it is blue.  I know in New York, bright colors are back in.  I've seen them in all the storefronts, so, you know, I'll defend you a little bit, but  that is lavender.  Lavender, lime green, peach.  I knew when this shirt was taken out for me last night, and my girlfriend said, she goes, 
[00:16:30]  uh, is this shirt okay?  Notice Anthony has to say girlfriend this morning.  My girlfriend.  Yeah.  And she goes, uh, is this, is this okay for tomorrow?  We all do that, too, when you get into the barrel and start to look ugly for you as far  as being a faggula.  Ah, my girlfriend.  Did I mention that I was, uh, out all weekend with my girlfriend?  Right.  She says, is this okay for tomorrow?  And I said, yeah, fine.  And, uh, she even said, she goes, you know, they're going to make fun of you for this. 
[00:17:00]  You think?  I go, I know, but I don't care anymore.  I don't care anymore.  That's me.  I don't care.  I feel comfortable.  It's light and airy.  You should feel the material, by the way.  It's very, uh, very soft.  Ugh.  Do it breathes?  What kind of pants do you have on?  I didn't even notice it.  I don't know.  They're, uh.  Ooh.  Look at his ass. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  I don't know.  Nah, it's normal.  All right.  They're nice jeans.  And that's how we start today's show.  It is Whip'em Out Wednesday, by the way.  I guess we finally have promos running that explain the whole process, hopefully, so we  don't have to waste too much time on it.  Good.  It's a great thing.  I've been seeing a lot more wows on the highways.  Thanks for the support, guys.  This sticker supports the show, and it also might give you a little treat as you're driving  around.  Yeah, you have that wow on your vehicle.  A girl sees it, and, uh, you know, if she's familiar with the program and Whip'em Out Wednesday, 
[00:18:00]  she'll pull up right next to you and flash her lovely breasts at you.  It's kind of a nice little pick-me-up.  You're driving home from work.  Maybe you had a lousy day.  You've had the wow on there supporting the show, and, uh, all of a sudden you turn and there's  boobs in your face, and you're like, what the, why is she, what, oh yeah, it's Whip'em  Out Wednesday.  And if you don't have a sticker, you could either get one through opiananthony.com, we  got the address and all the info for that, or you can make your homemade wow signs.  We like that.  Yep.  People are sending in pictures of their homemade wow signs, and they're going up on the websites. 
[00:18:30]  Uh, belt of scotch, no, I'm not wearing spats.  No spats.  Oh, I learned what spats were from you about two months ago, and then decided to make sure  I forgot about them.  Yeah.  Well, there's no real reason to know what spats are or what they're for anymore.  They have something to do with, uh, shoes.  Yeah.  I think, right?  They cover up your, your laces.  All right.  And your shoes.  Uh, speaking of wow, Anthony. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  I was watching the latest Assault on the Media.  Bravo, sir.  Bravo.  I got a big laugh out of it.  Very funny.  Yeah, we worked very hard on that one.  Mm-hmm.  We got Ziggy from MyRadioStore.com and XM411.com.  He does a lot for the program and a hell of a lot for XM.  And, uh, he, uh, he did a successful assault on the media with his lovely co-worker there,  right?  Roslyn did a great job.  Roslyn, that's right. 
[00:19:30]  I always forget her name.  She was so into it as soon as I mentioned it.  She just ran out the door, not even knowing what to do.  No one got fired.  No reporter got fired.  I'm looking at it on the screen here.  I love, there it is.  Coming into view.  Oh, boy.  They didn't see that coming.  They run right up behind him.  Yeah, we got him good that first time.  Do we have the audio of this guy?  Because, uh, most of these Assaults on the Media, they're more visual.  But this guy definitely stumbled.  He tripped up a word or two.  You guys were right behind him.  I mean, you came up with a sign right behind him. 
[00:20:00]  And, uh, what was said?  Uh, by us or by you?  Yeah, by you.  Oh, I just yelled out, uh, Opie and Anthony, XM Radio.  And Roslyn was just screaming.  She doesn't even know what.  She was excited.  It's great because they came out of the subway again.  Yeah, I don't know.  The subway is this very dangerous spot for these reporters these days.  Oh, it's another subway story, though.  Another subway story.  It's got to suck for these reporters because the guy is doing a story.  What was the story?  On rape or something?  Uh, yeah.  We found out about it.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, that's an awful story. 
[00:20:30]  Well, you know, our listeners, you know, we don't know what the reporter's doing.  We just know they're live and we have to attack.  So the guy is doing it in front of the subway entrance and he looks like he's safe.  I bet you, because I will explain in a second, but you got to think the guy thinks he's safe.  He could do his live shot with no problem.  And he starts up and then all of a sudden you see the pests.  Out of nowhere, that Opie and Anthony sign that is becoming oh so familiar on the news broadcast.  All of a sudden you see it coming up from behind, from a distance, going, oh boy, here it comes. 
[00:21:00]  And you know the camera guy, because obviously the reporter can't see it right away, but the camera guy has just got to be, oh, here it comes.  We've been hit.  We've been hit.  We've been hit.  And then next thing you know, the reporter, he wasn't as bad as Arthur Chiena, obviously.  Of course.  He stumbled over a word or two and kept his composure.  Did he say anything after you guys were done?  Yeah, he actually, like actually what happened was the CBS crew was set up one way and this Channel 7 guy was set up the other.  Yeah, because it was a big story.  Yeah.  So they had a bunch of stations there.  They had the whole thing crisscrossed, so they were like. 
[00:21:30]  Safety in numbers, they had an interlocking field of fire.  Yeah.  Great.  After we ran out of the subway, we did the Channel 7 guy.  I walked up to him casually, said, thank you very much, have a good day.  But the Channel 2 chick, who we didn't bother, just ran up to us and started yelling, hey, hey, can I ask you some questions?  Really?  Yeah.  So she ran up to us and got all in our face about Arthur Chiena and why we do what we do and how we can live with ourselves getting people fired.  Yeah, getting fired.  This guy didn't get fired. 
[00:22:00]  This is the same exact thing that happened, and this guy didn't get fired.  Do you see how quick they went from his read to the videotape?  It is so fast, and they didn't go back to him, yeah.  Like, they didn't give him time to say, what's your fucking problem, man?  It's so good that the media is recognizing that sign, though.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  Isn't it amazing, again, how incestuous that is?  That's the question they ask you.  Yeah.  How do you feel about getting someone, what?  Getting them fired?  Do they have a camera crew?  Well, it wasn't you.  Did the lady run at you with the camera crew? 
[00:22:30]  No, no, no.  It was just her with her pen.  Oh, it's great, though.  And a really bad suit.  We had another successful assault on the media.  Oh, they'll continue.  This sign will be popping up behind reporters everywhere.  There's a lot of discussion on the boards about maybe making the sign a little smaller.  Hmm.  Although you can see Opie and Anthony, but then when you're behind, you see Anthony and  our cartoon faces.  It's fine.  Whatever.  I kind of like it.  You know what it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  Especially since it was my name up there, really. 
[00:23:00]  But whatever.  I mean, they're great.  We love these assaults on the media.  Absolutely love them.  And they will continue, like Anthony said.  Perfect execution.  He wasn't touched or harassed in any way.  Not at all.  And just the message, Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio was yelled out.  The sign was very close to his back.  How close were you guys?  We're amateurs.  This is my first one.  I thought it was great.  No, the closeness is fantastic.  You couldn't have been more than six inches from behind the guy.  All I hear on his cell phone is Danny going, move back, move back. 
[00:23:30]  Move back.  Move back.  You're too close.  That's great.  We hit him again.  It's amazing.  We've had so much success with this assault on the media.  Anyway, remember I started this conversation by speaking of WoW.  Yes.  Now that it's WoW season, I'm just thinking, Anthony.  Whip him out.  I'm thinking.  Why not?  It's too bad Rosalind didn't whip him out because she has a nice set.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm thinking.  A little whip him out right there on the news.  I'm thinking a little bit about maybe how to take it to the next level without getting anyone in trouble.  That's the next level, all right. 
[00:24:00]  Yes, it is.  Just a thought.  Just a thought starter.  And if that goes well, I see Snatch.  I see Snatch.  Imagine that.  You know something?  We've gotten the F word.  We've even gotten the atom bomb, the C word.  We have gotten breasts on TV.  Yes.  Could you imagine live Snatch on network television?  Could you imagine the outrage and uproar if there was just Bush on the news or TV? 
[00:24:30]  How fantastic would it be if you're sitting at your house watching the same mundane news program and all of a sudden you're like, eh, well, whatever.  Well, I'll check out this story.  Is that a pussy?  Did I see pubic hair and Snatch?  Wow, would that be great.  That would be hilarious.  We'll start with boobies, though.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's the audio of the assault on the media just to hear the guy stumble.  Uh-huh.  It might not be a big deal, but when you're watching the video, it seems to be. 
[00:25:00]  This guy was really good.  Highway to the news reporter Marcus Solis is live in Hunter's Point with the very latest for us.  Marcus.  And, Laurie, the attack happening in one of the quietest and most desolate subway stations in the entire city.  Less than 800 people a day pass through this subway stop.  Still, the token clerk and the subway conductor were able to hear something and contacted police.  I guess there's not much there, but you could tell he'd changed his whole delivery.  Yeah.  That's the way you handle it as a reporter, though. 
[00:25:30]  You don't turn around and curse.  You just finish what you got to do and realize, oh, this is what it is.  What the fuck's your problem, man?  Yeah, we tried to go back for the 5 o'clock report, but fortunately I went back and he recognized me from before.  Do you think?  Why don't you just ask for a ride in the van?  I actually did.  I asked him if he wanted to come by the store and buy shit.  A ride in the van.  Did you guys give us a lift to your next location?  Fucking some bitches.  Oh, that's funny.  So the video is up on opandanthony.com. 
[00:26:00]  It's some good viewing.  Let's go to Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Nate.  Good morning, sweet tits.  Hi there.  Oh, boy.  Anthony had a go there.  I have now just seen the next demise of the Opian Anthony show, and it is Bush.  Bush on TV equals the next firing of the boys.  Is it illegal?  I can't believe it.  Yeah, you know what?  I'm going to go on record.  I see it happen.  I've just had the vision.  Here it comes.  I can't believe it.  Bush on TV, and the next day I'll have to buy Sirius to listen to that jerk-off hoo-hoo.  All right.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm going on record to say... 
[00:26:30]  What?  You have to discourage it?  I'm going to go on record and say, don't do Bush.  Ah.  Don't do Bush.  Ah.  I hear boobs is legal, though.  Yeah.  The first time that Harry Potter is on, I'm just going to say, someone's going to call  me up and say, I've seen Bush on TV, and that's it.  That'd be hard to do, by the way.  Absolutely.  Very hard to, you know, the camera height and everything.  You'd have to build an apparatus that would hold the woman up high enough to get her Bush  into the camera.  And you know those guys...  Do a handstand walk. 
[00:27:00]  There you go.  Just walk around with a stepladder.  They're working on it as we speak.  Huh?  And you know the guys at Wackbag are working on it as we speak.  Yes.  No, let's not do Bush, okay?  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Thanks, Nate.  All right.  Bush.  That would be something.  Yeah.  Well, Ziggy, we probably would get fired, though.  Ziggy, great job.  MyRadioStore.com.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, we'd probably be fired.  Yeah, let's not do Bush.  Yet.  How about a little ass?  Ziggy was also showing us the new Pioneer portable today. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  The new Pioneers are finally out.  How about that?  I got my MiFi, and I just took a look at this new Pioneer.  That's like the MiFi, for lack of a better description.  And it's like...  Sirius just has to be, like, beside themselves.  What is this called?  An airware?  Airware, yes.  Pioneer calls them airware.  There's another portable, full portable, with recording capabilities and everything coming 
[00:28:00]  out.  Here's another one that XM has, and Sirius just can't pull it together and even get one  on the market.  Not at all.  This unit looks pretty cool.  It's kind of...  Just to explain it, it's like a slightly thicker trio, right?  Yeah.  Slightly thicker trio.  It looks a little bit more like a cell phone, this one.  Yeah.  Right.  And it...  I think it's slightly smaller than the MiFi, or probably comparable.  The same.  Slightly...  You know, this one's a little rectangular.  The MiFi's a little shaped like an hourglass. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, but that just came out, and you're selling those now.  God.  I just got those in yesterday.  And you get the...  What was the other one?  The Tau's?  Yeah.  Tau from Giant.  Yeah, Tau has a portable out as well.  Those are nice and black and sleek for those people that...  Yeah.  Well, you got some nice choices now.  You got three portable units to choose from.  I'm telling you, it's the way to go.  I was just tooling around Manhattan yesterday, just listening to satellite radio everywhere  with my MiFi.  Yeah, it's the great thing.  In the cities, these things work flawlessly.  Hey, we're on the box.  Yeah, did you see that?  Only XM features MTV, VH1, Opie and Anthony, then Bob Edwards. 
[00:29:00]  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  This is the first time we've ever had billing over Bob Edwards on anything XM.  Thank you, Elo.  Thank you.  Yeah, on the old packages, it was the other way around.  It certainly was, and we took note.  So did XM.  Very good.  I'm hearing rumors that XM has full-page ads today in the New York papers.  Yes, they do.  Where is it?  I saw that in the back. 
[00:29:30]  Freaking Elo.  He's hilarious.  It says, what, oldies are alive and well on XM or something like that?  It says the oldies are alive and well, and living on XM satellite radio, only XM has six  commercial-free decades channels, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.  Oh, there it is.  And then it has a whole thing.  When CBS FM changed formats over the weekend and ended its commitment to the greatest hits  of all time, thousands of loyal listeners in the New York area were left with a tremendous  void in their lives.  XM satellite radio fills that void with six 24-hour channels dedicated to the greatest 
[00:30:00]  hits of each decade from the 40s through the 90s, and it's all commercial-free.  And if you're in the mood for something else, XM has over 150 channels of news, sports talk,  and music from virtually every genre.  Isn't it about time you get XM?  Hmm.  It's the perfect Father's Day or graduation gift.  Beyond AM, beyond FM.  XM satellite radio.  And they've got everywhere you can get it. 
[00:30:30]  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  That's really cool.  Jumping on the whole CBS change in format thing.  Here's someone else talking about XM.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM satellite radio along for  the ride.  XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock, alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop,  unsigned bands, blues, jazz.  There's an XM channel for everyone in the family, including the biggest names in news, 
[00:31:00]  sports, talk, and comedy.  All in digital quality sound for less than 10 bucks a month.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service.  The XM roadie from Delphi can turn any radio into an XM radio.  It's the smallest satellite radio ever, so it looks great on your dashboard.  Plus, for a limited time, you'll also get a free home kit so you can connect XM to any  home stereo.  XM makes a great graduation or Father's Day gift.  Check it out.  Electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM is XM's satellite radio. 
[00:31:30]  Ah, thank you, Howard Stern.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  See, he knows.  This is a great Christmas promotion, by the way.  Yeah.  He knows.  Let's say hi to Doug-out Doug.  Ah, Doug.  Doug, what's going on today, buddy?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Opie, I really have a serious question for you.  All right.  Why are you trying to make the prophecy come true?  If you fall for the third time just like Christ, then your misery will be complete and you  will die on a cross.  Are you talking about the Church of Opie? 
[00:32:00]  I am talking about the Church of Opie.  If you check out my thread about the parallels between your falling two times, once in Boston,  once in New York, just like the pagan Christ, the false god, you can make the prophecy come  true with this bush thing you just called for, and then thankfully...  No, Anthony called for the bush.  Oh, who did he?  Yes.  I called for the no bush.  Opie, you jump over that table and you slap him. 
[00:32:30]  This Church of Opie thing was funny at first, but now it's really starting to creep me out.  It is creepy.  Your suffering will only get worse.  I pray to you, please, please stop.  It's called churchofopie.org.  Is this your site, Doug?  No, it's not.  No, it's Freenick.  Oh, okay.  Freenick.  Oh.  It's pretty funny reading, I got to tell you.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  Punching out.  Hey, did you do one of these jingles we're going to play?  Actually, I started out with a jingle, and it mutated into one of those Galantathon commercials 
[00:33:00]  from like Springfield, New Jersey, you know, Galantathon, and it kind of mutated into something  that actually seemed like a decent idea, so it's actually more of a commercial slash jingle.  All right, very good.  Thank you, bro.  All right, guys.  Yeah, we're going to play the jingles in a few minutes here.  Let's say hi to Tony in Queens.  Tony, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  You know, you never mention XM online, but I think it's great because I used to have  to drag my radio out of the car and then hook it up to my home kit. 
[00:33:30]  Now I just turn on my computer, and it's like, boom, you guys are there.  It's dynamite.  So, I mean, there's another outlet that I don't know if Sirius is doing that or not, but it's  great for XM.  Yeah, the XM online is huge for us, so.  All right.  Punch it out.  Thanks.  Thanks, Tony.  You're right.  A lot of people, that's how they listen to us.  They don't have any hardware.  Listen at work.  If you're buried in the office somewhere, yeah, listen.  Listen on your computer.  All right, Anthony, I'm going to let you finish that half a sandwich there.  Nope.  And we'll continue with the program. 
[00:34:00]  When we get back, we've got listener jingles to get to.  Yeah, I've heard a couple of these.  My God, man.  We have a lot of audio.  Little Marky from yesterday.  There's a new one called Jesus Put the Stars in the Sky.  Are you kidding?  From Little Marky?  We've got more Little Marky.  I was listening to the Little Marky replay yesterday and laughing.  Pretty funny.  Man, that was really funny.  And then also we have, what was the other thing I wanted to talk about?  Oh, that song you like.  That's just been sitting here.  Yep. 
[00:34:30]  The remix.  Actually, we could go.  The Bob Kelly remix.  Why don't we go to break with this?  The Bob Kelly remixes are slowing down.  This one will stick in your head and you kind of sing it.  Sing it around the house.  All right.  A little song.  Who did this?  Jackalnut.  Huh?  Who?  Jackalnut.  Jackalnut.  All right.  These names are great, I've got to tell you.  They're great.  All right.  Everyone's got a handle these days.  Here's Jackalnut and his Bob Kelly remix song thing.  Yeah.  Down.  Way down.  I broke my knee, man. 
[00:35:00]  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Fuck!  I broke my knee, man.

This message was brought to you by the cooperative staff at the Opie & Anthony Program.  The Royal Caribbean Cruise Song.  The Royal Caribbean Cruise Song. 
[00:38:30]  That's right.  That stinks.  Reminds me of the cruise.  I love that song.  The Royal Caribbean Cruise Song.  That's right.  That stinks.  Reminds me of the cruise.  I love that song and you just...  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  They use it for Royal Caribbean.  Stop ruining our rock and roll.  Everything though.  It used to be you were selling out.  If you were a band and you used one of your songs in a commercial, forget about it.  You were a sell out and that was it.  Now it's coming to you.  It's coming to you.  The Royal Caribbean Cruise Song.  The Royal Caribbean Cruise Song.  That's right.  That stinks.  It reminds me of the cruise. 
[00:39:00]  I love that song and you just...  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  They use it for Royal Caribbean.  Stop ruining our rock and roll.  Everything though.  It used to be you were selling out.  If you were a band and you used one of your songs in a commercial, forget about it.  You were a sell out and that was it.  Now it's commonplace and you're stupid if you don't.  Well, now they look at it as a way, yeah, to get their music out there.  And it was songs that, you know, it used to be songs that were real old.  You know, you would never take a new song and use it in a commercial. 
[00:39:30]  Now, you know, songs that are just breaking are being used in commercials.  At the same time.  Yep.  Same time.  Name one.  And no one seems to care.  I know.  Yeah.  It's one of those, you know, it's kind of rough.  Black Eyed Peas.  Thank you, Ziggy.  Right from the get go, man.  I guess Ziggy's doing the show with us today.  Thank God.  I wouldn't have had an answer for that.  Jeff in Seattle.  What's up, Jeff?  Yo, O&A.  Hey.  You guys are sick.  And, uh, just wanted, hey, that Bob Kelly bit. 
[00:40:00]  That, that was the shit.  Whoever the fuck did that, that is the best one ever.  Oh, the remix there?  Broke my knee, man.  Broke my knee, man.  Broke my knee, man.  Broke my knee, man.  Broke my knee, dude.  Love it.  Hey, I guess we, uh, haven't fixed the phones yet.  They all just went away.  Oops.  They all just went away again.  The phones disappeared.  They just went poof.  It's magic.  And we had about four or five really good phone calls that we wanted to get to, so.  Oops.  Eh, no big deal, because we're professional broadcasters.  They'll call back. 
[00:40:30]  Opie, they'll call back, and we have Ziggy here.  If you want, I'll just, like, you tell him on a cell phone or something.  Yeah, right?  Go inside and call up.  Now we'll see how good you really are, Ziggy.  So, how are you?  Just great.  No, we can play some O&A fan jingles until the phones come back.  Yep.  Good excuse to get to these train wrecks, Anthony.  Here's the original, um, uh, remix that came in yesterday.  You have that? 
[00:41:00]  Wow.  The homophobe one?  Oh.  Not that one again.  What?  We love this one.  No, we don't.  Jimmy and I love this one.  We think it's creepy, and it has some kind of power that it annoys me.  Ugh.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  D-O-P-N.  Anthony Shaw.  Anthony.  Yeah.  All creativity has to start somewhere.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  What was the first movie?  Hmm?  Remember the movie about going to the moon or something?  Yeah.  It's a black and white film.  Oh, yeah.  The Jules Verne.  And the moon has a face or something, and the rocket lands in the eye or something.  Yeah.  And, yeah, because it's made of cheese, and the rocket hits the eye.  And they all get out with parasols and top hats on the moon.  Yeah.  Remember?  What the hell were they thinking?  When I took a few film classes?  Yeah.  See, sometimes you talk about how you missed out going to college. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What a waste of fucking time, man.  I actually took a class where we should talk about this someday.  What's it called there a lot?  Maybe today.  From the Earth to the Moon.  Yeah, From the Earth to the Moon.  That was kind of like, that jingle was kind of like From the Earth to the Moon.  What?  Wow.  It's the beginning.  Yeah.  It's the beginning of what is going to become.  I feel like there's something stuck in my eye.  What is going to become Star Wars Episode III.  Now you're a mad man.  From those humble beginnings, I'm putting the pressure on the listeners. 
[00:42:30]  We started with that, and they're going to get, you know, better and better.  I think the voice is what really annoys me on that.  That...  Homophobic.  It's the way it says homo.  Homophobic.  It just has that weird, like, early 80s new wave weird sound.  Yeah.  You know, like that.  Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday.  The Buggles.  Oh, Video Kill the Radio Star.  Yeah.  I was thinking more like Take the Skinheads Bowling.  Oh. 
[00:43:00]  Just weird, like, whatever.  Fish heads, fish heads.  Oh, there you go.  That's the one I was thinking of, actually.  There you go.  Yes, fish heads.  Yes.  It does have a fish head.  Thank you.  Can we get a little piece of fish heads there, Eric?  And perhaps we can compare, because maybe this guy is ripping them off.  Give me that.  I invented this.  Tell him, Fred.  Yeah.  Alright.  Hit this.  Fish heads, fish heads, roadie poie fish heads.  Fish heads, fish heads, eat them up, yum.  Fish heads, fish heads, roadie poie fish heads. 
[00:43:30]  Fish heads, fish heads, eat them up, yum.  All right.  All right.  Homophobic, homophobic, homophobic, homophobic, homophobic, homophobic.  I knew that this was bothering me all night.  That was bothering me all night.  You nailed it finally.  Thank you.  Yeah, there's some kind of influence there.  There's a fish head influence.  A fish head influence?  A Barnes influence?  Mm-hmm.  Wasn't it Barnes and Barnes, right?  Yeah.  Billy Mooby was involved with that, by the way. 
[00:44:00]  Anyway, what else?  The writing process.  Will Robinson from...  What I was going to say, maybe this could be a thought starter today.  Yeah.  Wait.  Really?  Yeah.  He was involved with Barnes and Barnes.  Okay.  Talk about some of the college courses we took that were just a complete waste of time.  Yeah.  I almost took a course called Spaceship Earth.  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  I never took it.  Spaceship Earth.  Isn't that the Epcot globe?  But just the name sounded cool.  Spaceship Earth. 
[00:44:30]  I'm like, I've got to take a class called Spaceship Earth.  Brought to you by AT&T.  You sit there and sit through a big long AT&T commercial.  I actually took a course in college.  It was Academy Award Films.  And all we did was watch movies and then discuss them.  Oh, I hate when you got...  You know why?  I never get what they're talking about.  Like when someone says, oh, there's some deep symbolism in this scene.  It's like, I missed it.  Really?  I didn't see the deep...  I'm just looking at the movie. 
[00:45:00]  No, it sucks.  Face value.  I'm reminded of that course today because here's to you, Mrs. Robinson.  Oh, oh.  Was that one of the movies?  The Graduate?  Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson.  The Graduate.  It's the front page of the Daily News.  Ann Bancroft is dead at 73 years old.  You're kidding.  She died of...  Where?  How did it happen?  Well, it started with a little tumor in her, you know, watch.  Oh, no.  And grew and grew and then they...  Who is this uterus is this? 
[00:45:30]  Cancer of the uterus.  Oh, no.  Did anyone know she was even sick?  Mel Brooks' wife, right?  73 years old.  Give my condolences to Justin Hoff.  But that was one of the films we had to watch in class, Anthony.  Yeah.  The Graduate, and the problem was you'd watch the film, which was cool.  Instead of, like, listening to a boring professor, you'd watch the whole film, right?  Uh-huh.  And this is where they just mess up everything. 
[00:46:00]  You'd think this would be the coolest course on earth.  Like, wow, you get to watch movies and discuss a little bit?  Yeah.  No, the problem is we would discuss it for a whole week until next Monday, let's say,  and then, you know, we'd finally get to see another film.  We would pick it apart for hours and hours and hours.  And, like, a little piece would be made this big important thing in the movie.  So, one of these courses that everyone was lining up to take thinking,  this is great and it's an easy A.  You're looking around the classroom like any other dumb course you had to take, 
[00:46:30]  and people are falling asleep like this.  Stinks.  Film school stinks.  It would be like, you ever read anything Kevin Smith wrote about film school?  It took, like, money and he was going to film school,  and then he decided it was such bullshit and such nothing  and describing what you're describing, you know,  watching a movie and then having it picked apart that he withdrew,  took the money that he would have spent on school and made clerks with it. 
[00:47:00]  So, I think that worked out for him a little better than film school.  Well, it's just kind of like, I hate to say this, but it's kind of like broadcasting school.  Yeah.  There's thousands and thousands and thousands of people going to broadcasting school every year,  and how many people are really doing it?  How many people leave broadcasting school and are successful in broadcasting?  Right.  You could get yourself a job somewhere.  My guidance counselor at Harbor Fields High School back in the day gave me the best advice ever. 
[00:47:30]  I said, I kind of want to do this radio thing or maybe TV or something, a little media action, right?  Mm-hmm.  And he goes, don't go to a trade school.  He said, suck my dick.  No?  He goes, don't go to a trade school.  Find a college where you can just get on the radio right away.  Like a college with a radio station.  Right.  And just start doing it.  Mm-hmm.  You're not going to learn anything in a classroom.  You're going to learn by doing it.  Learn by doing.  And I always remember that.  With professional broadcasters to teach you along the way.  And I got accepted to some pretty serious broadcasting schools. 
[00:48:00]  Like back in the day, Syracuse University was huge and Boston University.  And I chose Geneseo because I knew I could get on the radio as an 18-year-old.  Yeah.  And these other schools, because I did my research, they're like, oh, you're lucky if you're on the radio by your junior year.  Really?  Yeah.  Because everyone goes there to do that.  And there's only so many slots.  So they're like, you'd be lucky to get on as a junior.  Smart move.  Look at you.  So I went to Geneseo and I was doing radio, you know, by the first week of school. 
[00:48:30]  Really?  Yeah, just like that.  Three on the air.  See, kids?  There's your strategy right there.  Go to a shittier school so you can get on the air.  So kids, stop emailing me asking me for advice.  There's your advice.  That's it.  There it is.  In audio form.  Download it and send it to your friends.  I was actually considering when I was working for a living going to Connecticut School of Broadcasting  because I wanted to be in radio so badly. 
[00:49:00]  We had to do those live reads at the old joint and I would have fights with the salespeople.  I don't believe in this.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  They're probably listening right now.  I don't believe in it.  I just don't.  I'm not going to say that school in particular, but I think a lot of these schools just take your money.  Yeah.  I don't think they look at you and assess you and then realize that you're cut out for this.  They would rather just take it.  Who went to Connecticut School of Broadcasting?  Nathaniel.  Nathaniel did?  Well, he's a success.  He's doing well. 
[00:49:30]  Slow down.  He's an intern.  I know.  He's been an intern for a year and not getting paid.  He's doing great.  I've got to talk to Nathaniel.  Than, how are you today?  Super.  Very good.  You went to the Connecticut School of Broadcasting?  Sure did.  You completed your course?  Yes.  And did you learn anything?  I feel bad.  Uh-oh.  Why?  Well, I used all the audio software I used to edit for the shows and stuff. 
[00:50:00]  I taught myself that after I graduated.  Right.  So, you didn't really learn it there?  I learned a program called SAW, which no one uses anymore.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  See, that's...  See, this is what...  No, you're bringing back memories.  Go ahead, Nathaniel.  I'll tell you something.  Oh, no.  Doing better.  Right.  Because this was about three years ago.  But still, yeah.  I mean, Pro Tools is a huge juggernaut of audio software that everybody uses in radio.  Yep.  I had never seen it before, you know.  And believe me, we were using Pro Tools probably eight or nine years ago, me and Opie, 
[00:50:30]  over at AAF when they first got it.  Right.  So, it's been available to radio for quite a while.  I remember the production guy at AAF getting Pro Tools and a new computer and he was so  psyched at the fact that the hard drive was one gig.  He had a one gig hard drive and he was like, dude, it's a gig of storage space.  He was amazed. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  And we were using Pro Tools years ago.  So, three years ago, no Pro Tools.  No.  Oof.  In terms of...  I just feel bad.  I don't know why.  Let a rip.  Let a rip.  Let a rip.  In terms of job placement.  Yeah.  The only reason I'm here is because I happened to run into your brother on the bone.  That's how it is.  That's how it is.  See?  They didn't place you anywhere.  It was...  That's how it is.  That's how it is in life. 
[00:51:30]  Are you kidding me?  Anthony and I have been hugely successful and now with Jimmy, hugely successful.  But the fact is, the only reason Anthony and I are working together is because brother  Joe banged on a door one night.  Joe's brother.  My brother is the guy.  There was no big...  Radio would suck without my brother.  Right.  There was no big talent search or anything like that.  It was one day I happened to hear the banging on the back door because I was going to get  coffee.  Hey, dude.  I got a local band.  We do some song parodies.  You might want to take a listen.  I'm like, ah, yeah.  Whatever.  Ah. 
[00:52:00]  Get out of here, you kid.  And then...  Even though he's older than me, but...  Ah.  Ah.  And then I, one day...  This is how it works.  One day I had a bunch of cassettes in my car and I'm like, oh, this cassette.  And I checked it out and it blew me away, obviously.  I'm like, holy shit.  That's how it works.  But that's how it works.  You know, meetings and talent searches and, you know, line everyone up and the best one  will get the gig.  Yep.  It's a lot of luck.  It's a lot of luck no matter what profession you do.  Yeah.  And I'm sure it's like that in comedy.  No matter what you do.  My brother told Alan Freed to use the words rock and roll, actually. 
[00:52:30]  He was going to do like shake and tumble.  That absolutely wouldn't have worked.  Don't do that.  Michael J. Fox has that one.  He brings back memories, though, because when I was at Geneseo, by the time I was a senior,  I was actually teaching production to the freshmen and the sophomores because the teachers didn't  know how to do it.  The teachers didn't know how to do it.  And all you needed for supplies was a razor blade and some...  And a little piece of...  And a piece of chalk stuff, chalk tape, chalk marker, whatever. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  But the teacher was so out of touch.  He really didn't know how...  Like, he was teaching the class to begin with.  And I was rolling my eyes like, you gotta be kidding me.  So I started telling the teacher what to do and stuff.  And then eventually he was like, you know, maybe you should teach the class.  So I was like one of those student teacher people.  I never liked those.  Yeah.  I was that guy, though.  I was too involved in the whole teaching process.  I never even wanted to be there.  Dude, I was getting a paycheck as a senior in Geneseo.  Really?  Teaching this class, which went right to the bar to drink and stuff. 
[00:53:30]  Of course.  All right.  Well, thank you, Nathaniel.  Nathaniel, wow.  I was going to add one more thing as well.  That reel-to-reel editing is something I also learned in how to cue up a record.  Three years ago.  Yeah.  Cueing up records.  No joke, Ant.  No joke.  Three years ago.  And editing tape.  And they'll admit they're saying, oh, this is old school.  Nobody really does this anymore.  No one really does this?  No.  No one does this.  Period.  There is no reason anybody should know about tape anymore unless you're, you know, 
[00:54:00]  working at an archive.  What?  Tape.  Yeah.  I mean, I would have rather probably spent it learning cool editing.  What are you doing?  We're turning the reels.  We're turning the reels.  There it is.  Yup.  Do most people who go to the Connecticut school broadcasting or any of these places  become like successful radio people?  Mmm.  Are you saying I have no chance or something?  Not at all.  No, no, not at all. 
[00:54:30]  No chance.  Who's the guy?  There are comedy classes, and I look at what they do there and what they tell them,  and I'm wondering if it's I guess radio is the same.  They give you this out of touch advice.  A lot of improv going on there too, huh?  going to do tag outs today. What we're going to do is start a story. You start telling  it. And then when you get tagged, the other guy has to take up where you left off. Oh,  I love that. I could watch that for hours. It's all a crock of shit because you can make  some good money in radio. So why would you teach others to do radio? Because I can't 
[00:55:00]  imagine they're making a lot of money teaching others to do radio. So that means they're  not good enough to actually get those who can do, those who can't teach. Wait, how  much a week? 75 to 100 a week. That's it. Who makes 75 to 100 a week? All right. Thank  you. Why don't we move on here? There we go. What a great testimonial from Nathaniel. That's  right. Jesus. Tom in Philly, what's up? See you, buddy. Hey, boys. Hey. All right. We're 
[00:55:30]  still talking about those classes that sucked at college. Yeah. All right. I was in this  stupid honors program, so they had to make up these cool classes for us. And their one  big idea was to have us invent something. Right? So we spent the entire semester trying to get  something ridiculous patented. It was the biggest waste of time ever. And what did you invent?  Uh, let's see. We actually, it was awful. We had a, it was a bag to pick up dog shit that 
[00:56:00]  biodegraded. It was awful. What the hell is that? Inventing. Exactly. An inventing course.  There's, well, I remember hearing commercials for inventors. Call our number now. We'll send  you an inventor's kit. Yeah. And, uh, they tell you how to patent your idea. And all it is  is you're paying a huge amount of money to this company to send you stuff that you could get  on your own. Uh, they're not going to send you what you really need, which is a viable 
[00:56:30]  idea for an invention that hasn't been patented yet. A lot of people have patented, like, so  many things. It's hard to just come up with an idea that hasn't been thought of yet. So  these, uh, invention courses and invention kits and stuff, uh, big waste of money. You start  thinking, I could do that. I'll invent this. And you come up with something stupid. You  have to buy a degradable bag for dog shit. Shut up. There's, uh, it's funny you tell  with the radios. I know one of the things they probably tell you is that you have voice.  I was watching some, uh, Penn and Teller special. They had Tom Likas is one of the guys they 
[00:57:00]  interviewed. And this fucking phony. It was a, he talked a little bit off, off air. And  then when he gets on, on the radio with that awful radio voice, he's like, is that what  they tell you? That you have to talk a certain way. He's quite a puker. Oh, it is. Yeah.  Awful. How do you do radio? How do you talk like that? You gotta put that voice.  Do they teach you that in broadcasting school? Like you gotta sound like. I don't know what  they teach anymore, but, uh, when I was in college and stuff, that was the way to go.  Yeah. To just work on your voice. And I, uh, I had such a horrendous Long Island accent. 
[00:57:30]  And obviously everyone knows I, I, I speak horribly at times.  Speak horribly. I did that on purpose. Uh, and then I, I've just decided to go the other  direction. And, uh, and it lucked out, you know, it worked out for me. Thank God, you  know? Yeah. I wouldn't be in this if I had the big voice. No way. Just spinning tunes  and trying to talk up the music. Oh, yeah. No, I went down that road. I'll find my college  radio, uh, shows. They're awful. Well, your first one together was pretty good. We'll get 
[00:58:00]  back to that again. We'll definitely get to that again. Is this true? Huh? Uh, Sirius  just offered Nathaniel $20 million to do a show. Wow. Uh, Brian in Alabama. Good morning,  gentlemen. How are you today? Hello, Alabama. Just, uh, wanted to pass on that a couple of  years ago after the, uh, Lord of the Rings came out. Uh, there was a college that offered  Elvish as a class. Now, how useful is that? I love those courses. The what? Punching out 
[00:58:30]  guys. Elvish. Yeah, Elvish. And what did it, uh, it, it teach you, uh, the language? I don't  know. I didn't take it. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes after, like, pop culture things come out, like  movies or something, colleges offer these dopey courses that probably fill up in a second.  Right. Because they're just wastes of time. Didn't they have some kind of course about the  Simpsons or Homer or something? Yeah, yeah. Something like that. I remember reading about  that. And the teacher tries to make it something educational, but you're just in there to watch  Simpsons. Yeah. Let's go to, uh, Kim in New Jersey. Kim, what's up? Hi. I went to Seton 
[00:59:00]  Hall and I needed an extra math credit. They actually offer a one credit course in Saber  Metrics, which is baseball statistics. Baseball stats. Yeah. That's the course.  The Society for the Advancement of Baseball Research. Wow. I mean, and you see that course  and you're like, hey, that's kind of cool. But they, they bore the shit out of even the  cool courses. But even that, you could kind of see some kind of value in it as far as math  goes and business, something like that, statistics. You know, that's, that's just a statistics 
[00:59:30]  course with kind of a, a nice subject, baseball. Yeah. But it's still statistics. Some of those  things like Elvish. What, what the hell are you going to, where are you going to apply  learning Elvish? Death and the Afterlife. Doughboy from Whackbag. You watch slides of  a teacher who travels the world and takes pictures of various, uh, burial rituals, churches, and  graveyards. I mean, what, what are you going to use that for? That sounds cool. I, I took 
[01:00:00]  a course where all I had to do was read books. Isn't that school? Well, it's different topics  though. That's all I had to do. The, the actual sitting in the classroom was nothing. It's just  book reports. You just, uh, a whole course on book reports. You had to read a book and then  write about it. That was it. I hated book reports. I can never do the outline right.  Like I had to do an outline and I never knew what to put up at the big Roman numeral and  then the number and then the subset letters. Stop, you're freaking me out. I'm like, what  do you do? I, I don't understand. I'll put that up by the big Roman numeral. I'll put this 
[01:00:30]  by the letter and this by the number and I have no clue why. You write the report first  and then just kind of back do it. Yeah. You do it like, uh, yeah, but why would you  ever need that? Well, I have never outlined anything since I was 10 years old. Our schooling  school. I know there are a lot of teachers that listen to us, but our schooling just stinks.  It really does. You're just going through the motions for a piece of paper. I learned everything  I know 99% of what I know after school. Once I was out of school, uh, you know, you learn 
[01:01:00]  your basics in elementary school that you kind of need to, to move on with your life. But  then once you hit junior high, it's a waste of time. I was, uh, I was a math whiz growing  up and, uh, if I ever knew sitting here today that I would never need trigonometry, the stress  I went through to try to, you know, figure that stuff out and remember it and learn it.  Yeah. And now I'm like, why? Why did I have to do that? Why? Let's get the, uh, let's clean 
[01:01:30]  up some stuff here. We started talking about Anne Bancroft. We got that, uh, new story in,  uh, in the let there dead. She's dead, which means two will follow. She was in the, um, she  was in the miracle worker with Patty Duke. Yeah. She played, uh, what's her name? Sullivan,  the teacher. Right. And, uh, I remember as a kid and this is kind of, uh, should, kind  of should have shown me where I was going to end up in this very studio goofing on shit 
[01:02:00]  all day long. That gave such laughter to me and my brother. We watched the Helen Keller  thing when, when, uh, Patty Duke who plays Helen Keller, blind, deaf, dumb, uh, and the teacher  trying to teach her, uh, she takes her to the water pump and starts pumping water on her  hands and she finally goes, me and my brother just bust out laughing. And for, for years  after that, we would just go, and imitate a, a deaf person, a handicapped person. And 
[01:02:30]  look, now I have a career doing the very same thing. Now it's my job. Can we get those clips  today? Oh, come on. They might be hard to find, but maybe some listeners can mail it in  or whatever. Little Patty Duke. And then there was a remake with, uh, Laura Ingalls,  I guess. Right. Well, let's go to the, uh, the official report. Is it this one over here?  All right. Ann Bancroft had said she sent her husband Mel Brooks to an analyst when he said  he was afraid of writing a full-blown musical out of the producers. And when Bancroft watched 
[01:03:00]  Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick rehearse for the producers, she realized how much she missed  the theater herself. In 2002, she returned to Broadway for the first time since 1981, appearing  an Edward Albee's occupant. Ah, there's nothing there. Cool. No, that was fascinating. Yeah,  what, like, the way she was out of it, and then she wanted to do it. And she saw something  and then decided, hey, all right, well, why not? We'll go to the next Ann Bancroft clip,  clip then, you assholes. Go ahead. I am quite surprised that with all my work, and some of it 
[01:03:30]  is very, very good. I'm not remembered for that, you know, that nobody talks about the miracle  worker. We're talking about Mrs. Robinson. Right. Good point, Ann. Yeah. With your pointy  tit. I wish I had your problem. I love these idiots in Hollywood. She wanted to be recognized  for her acting chops as the teacher in The Miracle Worker. Right. And not as the seductress  in The Graduate. One of my favorite movies, by the way, The Graduate. Yeah. Hit it again. 
[01:04:00]  Once I'm through with the role, I'm through with it. That's it. Goodbye.  Bye. Really? Well, a lot of my friends and I were hanging out. We're like, what do you  think Ann Bancroft does when she's done with the role? Some of us said she's through with  it. Others said she can't stop thinking about it. She can't stop thinking about it. And  apparently, we now have an answer. Well, there goes that Friday night. She's through with  it. Yeah. One more clip, because you guys are enjoying this. Go ahead. I'm not disappointed  of anything. I'm just a little dismayed that people aren't beyond it yet. Beyond the fact 
[01:04:30]  that everyone remembers her from The Graduate. We were just in the office talking, discussing  is she dismayed with anything? And now, there's the answer. She's dismayed. All  right. Not disappointed, though. She was in The Elephant Man, but she didn't have a very  big part in that. No? No. I didn't know she was in it. I'm thinking she was the queen or  the one who really liked him, I think. Yeah. Oh, no. Maybe she was Anthony Hopkins' wife.  Somebody disgusted with his appearance? Yeah. Oh, she was, ugh, number five. 
[01:05:00]  I think she was Treves' wife. I'm not an animal. I'm a human being. I treasure her. Let's go  to Gold Dragon, the trucker. Gold Dragon. Morning, gentlemen. Morning. Gordon, you tasty little  treats. Hi, fella. You guys were talking about crazy stuff in college, the courses. When I was 
[01:05:30]  in college, I was taking music theory, performance, etc. They had this, I can't even remember even  what the hell it was at the time, what they called it, but basically it was how to put  on a jam band and how to work with each other and make the sound better, etc., etc. And as  their highlight of the course, they brought in Harry Connick Jr. and his funk band. Oh,  wow. Well, that had to be good. Yeah, it was a panty liner moment. Punching out. That was 
[01:06:00]  another thing that happened, especially out here on Long Island. They have what's called  Five Towns, Five Towns College for music. And anybody who was in a band growing up on Long  Island, it was always the rich kid in the band that had gone to Five Towns. And it  just got you nowhere. They were talking about how, you know, you could be a performer in  a rock band and Five Towns is going to help you or an engineer and they'll teach you on  the latest mixing equipment. You know what? More waste of money. Especially when it comes 
[01:06:30]  to music, I think you either have it or you don't. Right. And this Five Towns, there's got  to be obviously thousands and thousands of graduates. Yeah. Name one, someone from Long  Island, name one graduate that's in a band that we know. Did Pat Benatar go to Five Towns?  I don't think so. Name one. Did Eddie Money go to Five Towns? Name one. Someone will come  up with somebody. Well, do you remember the tambourine player from the nitty gritty dirt band? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah. He went to Five Towns. Billy Joel drove into the building once. I heard that, but that's  about as close as you can get. Give me one graduate that is doing well from going to  that place. From Five Towns. Let's go to Carl. Carl, what's up? Yo, what's up, guys? Hey.  When I was in fourth grade, my teachers made a huge thing about the Helen Keller movie. Yeah.  And they lined everyone up like almost like an auditorium, like, you know, with the chairs  and they set up the TV. It completely backfired on them because it was, it might as well have 
[01:07:30]  been a comedy as far as... Of course. And in fourth grade, you're going to watch that  in a room full of your friends? You're going to laugh your ass off. It was the funniest  thing. It was one of the biggest laughs of, like, my life because we were just making fun  of that movie every step of the way. All right. We need clips now of this movie. How are we  going to get that? We could even do it tomorrow. We have to. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Remember  when they would take you into the auditorium to watch a movie with the whole school? Like, it  was in elementary school. I remember one called Hemo the Magnificent. Did anyone ever see 
[01:08:00]  Hemo the Magnificent on the circulatory system? Oh, those films. And it was a whole thing on  the circulatory system. And it was an old professor guy and kind of this younger guy. And the professor  guy had to teach the younger guy about the circulatory system. And he would always go to these  film clips. And he'd be like, OK, well, roll five. And he'd roll like a film clip. What  year is that? 1956? They showed it in my school in, like, 1968 or 69 or something. We were 
[01:08:30]  little tater tots. And they showed us Hemo the Magnificent. Jesus. Hemo. Can we get clips  of that, Bill? And, of course, it turned into Homo because you're kids and you're making jokes.  Homo the Magnificent. You'd find one of the faggy kids in school and call him Homo the  Magnificent. Hey, look, it's Homo the Magnificent. Ha ha. You're a homo. 1956. Man, you know 
[01:09:00]  what? You just. The blood is different for the Negro. I didn't know it was that old. You  just brought up something that's another thought starter. You can help your circulation by smoking  Lucky Strike cigarettes, too. Always good for your blood flow. Over the weekend, I went  to my nephew's baseball game, OK? He's a pretty good baseball player already, right? And I  haven't seen, you know, young kids play sports in quite a long time. Oh, what you're missing 
[01:09:30]  out on? And it's just. I hang out by the schools all the time and watch. It's just so funny,  you know, even at that age, they're like five, six-year-olds that you can tell if they're going  to be good athletes or if they're going to be ballerina dancers. Oh, wow, really? Oh,  my God. I'm watching this game, right? And my nephew, he knows what he's doing. His father's  really good at baseball and stuff, so he's got some talent already, whatever. And then there's 
[01:10:00]  other kids on the team that got talent, all right? And they got good arms and they throw. They're  five and six, but they know how to play the game. They get their glove down and they know how to  throw to first base. They know how to run out the play. They know how to bat. And then you have  these other kids that are the same age, five or six. They're just swinging at the sky. They can't  even, like, can't even get close to hitting the ball. And then if they do. Lupus. Yeah, pretty much,  right. Bad news bears. Then if they do, this one kid runs to first base and, you know, while other 
[01:10:30]  kids on the same team, you know, dig in and they're getting ready to run a second, you  know, concentrating on the pitch, this kid starts doing what could only be described  as ballerina moves on first base. That's not good. And I'm like, oh, my God. I think  you know if your kid is gay, even that young. Didn't Brian Regan do a bit about that? Oh,  boy. Am I ripping off Brian Regan now? He would, who, no, who said that? They would spin  around in the outfield. Wasn't that Jimmy? No, who would spin around? Oh, you. And 
[01:11:00]  it was like, what are you, a ballerina? Hey, Jimmy, what are you, a Mr. Wissenda yelled,  hey, Jimmy, what are you, a ballerina? But that was because you had some weird OCD. Ballerina.  Yeah. I played for Young's Glass Service. That was the name of my baseball team. Oh, it  was? Yeah. Chico's Bell Bonds or something? It was the same. But it was just really fascinating  to watch the game and just see the personalities of all these kids. You can tell other kids  they're going to be, you know, good at another sport, but baseball is just not their thing. 
[01:11:30]  But then you saw these other kids that you could tell their parents were like, get out  there and play. Hustle. And you could tell they don't want to. They already want to be  on a stage singing and dancing. Drama. They're going to be in the drama class. And I'm thinking  even at that age, five, six, this kid was like doing weird dance moves on first base. Yeah.  Yeah. Let's go to the phones here. Skip, what's going on? I just want to let you know,  this is kind of late, but it's seven o'clock this morning. I was on Comedy Channel and I 
[01:12:00]  heard Sonny Fox say, if you're a fan of the morning zoo, tune over to 202. You can listen  to Opie and Anthony, our own morning zoo. Oh, damn it. Morning zoo, huh? Yeah. Hey,  hey. These fucking people that are out of touch. We're not a morning zoo. That is a complete  insult. I know. Isn't Sonny Fox the old, isn't he a fossil from New York City doing  old children's shows? Sonny Fox runs the Comedy Channel, right? 150. We barely talked  to him, which is unfortunate because I think we could have a nice little relationship considering 
[01:12:30]  we do a comedy program. Yeah. Not a morning zoo program. He's not that Sonny Fox though,  sir. Oh, he's not? Okay. No. Oh, there's another Sonny Fox? Sonny Fox hosted Wonderama here  in New York for a while. Yeah, that was a different Sonny Fox. Look, if you're calling us a morning  zoo, I can only take it one way. It's an insult. Yeah. It really is an insult. Or you're just  out of touch and you don't understand what it is. He sounds ancient. All right. Thanks,  Skip. Okay. Fast Freddy, that shit fuck bass player from the Stray Cats went to five towns.  All right. Jesus. That's about all we got, the bass player from Stray Cats? You have to go 
[01:13:00]  all the way back to the Stray Cats to find a graduate of that place that's doing well? Can you  say that I think the Stray Cats are terrible? I don't know how anybody ever enjoyed their music.  I like the Stray Cats. I know a lot of people did. They were very popular. They were horrendous.  I wasn't into it. Ba-dum-boom-dum-boom-boom-boom-boom. All right. Anyway, we started this break  talking about jingles, Anthony. We did? So why don't we get through some of the jingles  that came in, the O&A jingles. All right. They're all quick, so let's start with P-Niggity's. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, that voice. That annoying voice of his. P-Niggity's voice is the worst. Well, that's the  guy. These guys are becoming little stars. Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates. Here comes  Professor Anthony. Oh, that's the same guy? Right? Is it? Yeah, it is. Forget Aristotle 
[01:14:00]  and fuck Socrates. Here comes Professor Anthony. Same guy, right? Yeah. All right. Does he slurf  in this song? Hello, my name is P-Niggity. I'm very pleased to meet you. By the way, bear with us  because the last one is really, really funny. That one's the money shot. It's the money shot and it's  going to raise the bar as far as the O&A jingles go. But first, we got dugout Doug and he decided to 
[01:14:30]  do something for a national sticker stop. It's not what we're looking for, but what the hell. Let's take a  listen to this and see what it's all about. XM202 WHV. XM202 gives you the Opie and Anthony  show. Wow sticker blowout. On July 20th, the Opie and Anthony show. Not in any trend. We'll  attempt the first nationwide. Hold my hand, man. I got a screen stop. Wow sticker stop. Volunteers 
[01:15:00]  are needed. One from each state of the union. For the first ever nationwide. Wow sticker  stop. It's summer. It's wow. It's a fucking great idea. Email Steve at foundrymusic.com  to volunteer. And Steve was listening to that in the office and goes, no, don't. He goes,  no, don't. People are a little confused as to what a jingle is. That's kind of a promo. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, that's more of a promo. We're looking for those, you know, happy singing Opie. Brandon  from West Virginia. 101. We play your favorite oldie CBS FM. There you go. You know, one of  those. Brandon. Yes. Go ahead. You want to defend Sonny Fox? Yeah. All right. Sonny Fox,  I like Sonny Fox and the Comedy Channel. I'm just saying that if you're tired of the morning  to turn over to 202 and listen to ONA. Oh, see? Some stupid listener got it wrong. He's 
[01:16:00]  stupid. Well, thank God he said that because that's more accurate, much more accurate. We  should never take the listener's words for it. Yeah, because then we start problems with  them. And then we go to these XM events and no one wants to talk to us. Because you stupid  listeners got your info wrong. He's like, I only told people to listen to you. I don't know what I did  wrong. I encourage people to listen to your program. Go listen to your show. What do I  do? Let's go to Chris in Kentucky. Chris? Yeah, what's up? Yeah, kind of the same thing. 
[01:16:30]  I wanted to defend Sonny. I listened to the, before y'all came along, I listened to 150  all the time. Hardly ever go over there now, but Sonny, for when y'all play that, okay, terrific.  That is Sonny Fox. He's a really cool guy and I know he gets the program. You guys rock and  I'll punch him out later. Yeah, this is, I don't do this often, Anthony, but I want to apologize  to Sonny Fox. We got the wrong information. What a doodle. Apologize. Apologize. But let's  not get confused here. We still don't like Bruce Kelly. Poor Bruce. What's wrong with 
[01:17:00]  Bruce? Huh? Bruce is a good guy. Bruce is harmless. He means no harm. Actually, you know  what? I was thinking about the Bruce Kelly situation on the way home. Actually, I think  yesterday. What's your take on it? I do like him and I'll tell you why. Because he could  take it. Yeah, well, he absolutely can. He understands the game. He completely understands  the game. He takes a lot of shots from us. Bruce was fine right up until he walked in 
[01:17:30]  on our show in D.C. that day and sat down and like threw our entire show off just by sitting  there. Most people, you know, wait for the invite or something and we're not like, you  know, crazy like you don't come into the studio or anything. So I'm leaving, guys. No, no,  you are more than welcome, Ziggy. Oh, Ziggy, you stay there. I didn't even know you were  still here. I didn't either. It's fine. You're a pleasant condition. Isn't he good? We like  a guest that doesn't talk. It's our favorite guest. Yeah. But he just sat down and... 
[01:18:00]  Well, he wants to be the mayor of the XM compound. That's obvious. Is that it? You  think he's trying to... Oh, yeah. He wants to be everyone's friend. The rep. He's that  guy that... There's one in every office. He wants to be the guy. Everyone's how. He wants  to be the, quote, mayor. He wants to be the guy you come to with your problems, man. Hey.  He wants people to say this. I don't know. You got to talk to Bruce. What do you think  Bruce would be talking about? Yeah. Well, brother, I'm going to go ask Bruce about  this one. Yeah. He so wants to be that guy involved in everyone's life and, you know, and the 
[01:18:30]  gossip and everything. Yeah. Yeah. Like, all-knowing. Yeah. He knows everything that's going on  at XM, so no matter who asks him anything, he's got an answer for it. But instead, everybody's  like, shut up, Bruce. Yeah. And pull your pants down a little bit. Jesus. Yeah. What's  wrong with you? Bruce, you got to pull your pants down. They're up too high. Yeah. Just pull 
[01:19:00]  him down to mid-stomach. That'd be nice. He's got to have horrendous racing stripes in  his underwear. Just horrendous. They've got to be, like, two feet long. When he takes  a dump, he opens the pee hole. Is that how far I pull him up? He's got the William Frawley  look. Pants up to his nipples. Ah, man. Rotten little cuffs down by the ankles. Awful socks  showing. Fat, lonely man's feet. Bumbling around from studio to studio. How you doing? 
[01:19:30]  How are you? Just here to suck all energy and fun out of the room. I'm going to leave.  He's actually not that bad. I like him. There's other guys that do that. His job is just to  be everyone's friend. I'm your friend. Yeah. I'm the guy you can come to and talk to. Hey,  Bruce, what do you think about this situation I'm having? I mean, this annoying guy just keeps  what... Forget it. Let me... But I've never bad-mouthed Bruce Kelly. I happen to like  him. All right. Let's go back to the jingles here. Here's one from Pape. 
[01:20:00]  Heed all jingles. Make sure nobody understands a fucking word of it. What the hell? I recognize  it's the Greg and Tony show. Wow. And after that, I don't know. I think someone's sucking  someone's dick in there somewhere. Did you hear that? I think so. No? I didn't. A little  staticky and... What? Pick out keywords. You can't understand anything. Pick out keywords. 
[01:20:30]  Sex advice, I think I heard. Sex advice, I heard. That's one thing, and it's all I heard  out of the whole thing. Now that I listen to it a second time, I hear sucker tits. Sucker  tits? Something's getting sucked. Really? What do you think, Jimmy? I don't know, but it's  sex advice. I heard sex advice. All I heard was on XM. That's all I can pick up. One more 
[01:21:00]  time. One more time. Let me get a good list. Pick out keywords.  I heard sex advice, wiener back. The Greg and Tony show three times. Good grape? I have  no idea. But I think he mentions you. Sex advice with Norton, Dr. Norton or something like  that. Are you kidding? You got that much out of it? Oh, yeah. I heard Dr. Norton's 
[01:21:30]  sex advice or something like that. What's he saying at the beginning? It's the Greg and  Tony show, the Greg and Tony show, the Greg and Tony show. Is that what he's saying?  Which I actually, I like it. If you weren't such a mumbling horse's ass, or if you didn't  record this inside a tin phone booth. But now I've got to hear a Greg and Tony show.  Because I actually like this. All right, you want to hear it again? This is good.  Greg and Tony show. Okay, listen, it's either Dr. Norton with sex advice or Norton with  sex advice, something like that. Dr. Norton with sex advice, unintelligible. 
[01:22:00]  Spread the hiv? He says spread the hiv? I thought it was scared to poop. Scared to poop? I don't  know. What are you talking about? That's what the thing I thought he heard. No, he didn't.  Spread the hiv and scared to poop? Wow. Geez. That's what they teach me at that Connecticut  School of Broadcasting. Greg and Tony show. Greg and Tony show. I kind of like that one  now. It's great. I kind of like it. I like the opening bump. But I'm an outbomb. I kind  of like it. Can we clear it up? How did you record that? Mumbling ass. But I don't want 
[01:22:30]  to redo it because you'll lose what you did. No, it never comes out good. Look, let me just  tell you. There's one here that just blows them all away. So don't even discuss how you  like the others. All right, but I do like this one. Because eventually, not eventually, really  soon, we'll get to the one that we really like. And it's going to bring this whole thing  to a higher level. Did he say whack-a-bag? Oh, whack-a-bag? He said whack-a-bag.  Pappy, clean that one up, but don't redo it. It's the tempo. The vibe will change if you  redo it. Oh, here's Pappy. He made the jingle. Jesus. He's on the line. Oh, good.  Pappy. Yeah, hi, guys. We like it, except it's hard to understand. I know. I recorded it 
[01:23:00]  last night. I had a bad earphone. Do you want me to translate? Yeah, what is it? You got  most of it. It's a Greg and Tony show. Greg and Tony show. Greg and Tony got Dr. Norton  with sex advice. Wear no bag. Spread the hips. It's on XM. I love it. See, that would  make a laugh. Wear no bag. Now I got to hear it again, now that I know all the words. This  beat is fantastic. I like it. All right, wait. Sing it again just before we play it. Okay. 
[01:23:30]  Go ahead. One more time. It's Greg and Tony show. Greg and Tony show. Greg and Tony got  Dr. Norton with... Ah, fuck. Okay, continue. Let me try again. All right. It's a Greg and  Tony show. Greg and Tony got Dr. Norton with sex advice. Wear no bag. Spread the hips. It's  on XM.  Oh, it's so obvious. Now I can hear it. Now I can hear all of that. Now it's so obvious. 
[01:24:00]  I told you. I like it. There's something Pulp Fiction about it. Yes. It's great. I like  it. Very good, Pappy. Yeah, clean it up and send in another version. But don't lose the  tempo or anything. It's perfect. I'm sure it'll stink when he redo it. I know. The second  time they redo it, it's always too clear. They throw in some, like, effects that they should  do it on the first time. I like it. This is the beginning of a bit. I think eventually 
[01:24:30]  it's going to really take off. Here's Schnit Dick instead of Shit Dick. Schnit. Schnit Dick.  Well, maybe not. It might be a typo because he's from North, N-O-R-F, Carolina. North,  North. And Carolina is spelled C-A-R-O-I-L-N-A. Which way is North?  Well, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. He's raping infants. On Opie and Anthony. 
[01:25:00]  Holy mother of... What is... What? All right. He's raping infants? And by the way, is it  really rape if they  don't object you?  Jesus.  All right.  Let's go with  Matt from Philly's 
[01:25:30]  Jingle.  The Opium Anthony  Show on XS  Satellite Radio.  We're  tanks for  nothing!  Moving right on.  I thought that was  terrific.  Here's one from  Guy Incognito. 
[01:26:00]  It's Jimmy,  the aborted fetus  what?  I don't know.  I didn't catch that  even.  I didn't catch that  either.  Mick.  It's Jimmy,  the aborted fetus  what?  Mick, I think it is.  Mick?  Sounds like a  light, but that  doesn't make sense.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go with  this is JM.  And then we'll get 
[01:26:30]  to the one we all  really like.  Okay.  Go.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And  Ben's Luscious Hog,  I Volk is 202.  See?  I kind of like that.  All right, I'll tell you  something.  That fits the jingle  thing.  Of course.  Ben's Luscious Hog.  Right.  Like things like that.  That's more of a jingle.  With the high energy music  behind it.  Ben's Luscious Hog,  XM 202.  That's it. 
[01:27:00]  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Ben's Luscious Hog,  I Volk is 202.  Ben's Luscious Hog.  He sings it horribly.  Oh, it's awful.  It's awful.  Ben's Luscious Hog.  Sweating zilch in front  of a computer with an  erection and fucking  kiddie porn on one  screen.  Trying to record it.  Ma!  Ma!  I like that one.  Ben's Luscious Hog. 
[01:27:30]  Ben's Luscious Hog.  You guys have no idea.  Ben just hates when we  talk about his penis.  He hates it.  Of course he does.  The shame he holds  between those legs.  That's like everyone  else drives a Saturn and  you're ashamed of your  Lexus.  It just doesn't make  sense.  Doesn't.  Just relish.  Here's a one.  They pointed and laughed  as children.  That's why.  They really did.  In the schoolyard.  They pointed and all  laughed and did things  like, nyan, nyan, nyan,  nyan, nyan.  Ben got a big dinky,  nyan, nyan, nyan.  Nyan, nyan.  Before it was cool to  have a big hog when  you're a kid.  It's just embarrassing. 
[01:28:00]  They pointed and mocked  him and shunned him.  Mountain crotch.  They play a little  nickname for him.  Little nicknames for  him.  Ha ha.  Ben got an anthill in  there.  Ha ha.  Big Ben.  You know, like the  clock.  Only it's cock.  You know, they threw  all those things around  at him and now he's  ashamed.  First time he was at  camp, waddling around  like a tall infant with  that fucking monstrous  heavy third leg.  Awful ball back.  He probably had pubic  hair when he was like  eight.  Curly hairs wrapped 
[01:28:30]  around that fucking  dick.  All right, listen.  Here we go.  This is the one we  really, really like.  Although, Ben's  luscious hog and I'm a  big fan of the Greg and  Tony show.  Yeah, I like that one.  I like that one, yeah.  Well, that's not  the real one.  This one.  I don't know.  I kind of like it.  It's kind of got a  weird sound to it.  This next one doesn't  need any cleaning up  whatsoever.  All right.  And we don't even know  who made this.  Oh, his name's Tallman,  I guess?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  This is from Tallman. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, hey!  Anthony!  And Norton, too!  Good times, great hits!  XF-202!  Suck my fucking cock!  What a payoff.  That's great.  That rules.  Yeah.  It's got the sound, 
[01:29:30]  it's got the jingle  sound to it, the high  energy, his delivery is  that bad high energy  delivery, and it has a  money shot.  It's got to pay off at  the end.  That guy nailed it.  One more time.  One more time.  O.B., Anthony, and  Norton, too!  Good times, great hits!  XF-202!  Suck my fucking cock! 
[01:30:00]  I'm sorry.  You can't lose with that.  That one blows all the  others away, man.  That was a big finish.  Bravo.  Tallman.  Very good.  That's a lot of fun.  Well, that's not bad.  Not bad for the first  patch.  Well, this is what I  want to show you now,  Anthony.  Remember, we were  talking about the first  jingle.  Give me that first one  again.  Oh.  We started here.  Well, someone had to  get this bit going.  That's why you've got to  bear with us sometimes. 
[01:30:30]  The whole O&A jingle  thing started with this.  And now, we're up to this.  O&A, Anthony, and Norton, too!  Good times, great hits!  XF-202! 
[01:31:00]  Suck my fucking cock!  I like how it goes off there.  It's not suck my fucking cock!  It's suck my fucking cock!  It's a question.  Yeah!  All right.  That's good.  Bravo, tall man.  All right.  Looking forward to more.  That's your home project.  We give homework here on this  program.  You know, when we get back,  this Honeymooner thing is  really just starting to piss me 
[01:31:30]  off.  Being a huge fan of the  original Honeymooners, I don't  get it.  I don't get that they're trying  to pull us off as a movie that  has anything to do with the  original.  No, it doesn't.  Just call the movie something  else and I'll be happy.  Yeah, you see the trailers for  it on TV, and it doesn't  resemble the Honeymooners at  all.  I don't even mean black and  white.  It has nothing to do with the  Honeymooners.  And I've seen them try to fit in  a line or two from the series,  and it just doesn't work. 
[01:32:00]  Because instead of just saying,  let's have two different jobs,  they figured that people would  go to see it because of the  Honeymooners.  Right.  Why did I just say that?  Could I have said anything that  was less necessary?  Elo.  Jesus, that really was.  You know, they figured they  called it that people would  see it.  If they called the  Honeymooners, people will go  see it.  Well, you kind of make a good  point, though.  If it was called anything else,  it would just be another movie.  But now maybe they'll get a  little more action from this  movie because it is called  the Honeymooners.  They are, though.  Look at the fact that 
[01:32:30]  everybody's talking about it.  They're on the Today Show.  What is everyone this is?  Good morning.  What is this one?  Today Show.  Yeah, whatever.  Katie Couric dyed her hair  really blonde to try to look  young today.  Younger and younger.  She's trying to look.  Oh, it's on Rotten Tomatoes  already?  Yeah.  What did it get?  We got two reviews so far.  I love Rotten Tomatoes.  By the way, Cinderella Man on  Rotten Tomatoes is getting  fresh tomato, 82% good reviews.  Hold on.  Before you go, let me see this.  Because I thought I was reading  that Cinderella Man's getting  horrible reviews. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, I read a bad one.  Honeymooners, Anthony.  I've seen lots of horrible  movies this year.  I can't imagine them getting  any worse than this.  And then click here to read  movie reviews, the other one.  But that's all they have so far.  They're just starting to  recommend the reviews.  But here's the trailer.  Listen to this.  Yeah.  Ralph Cramden's not just a bus driver.  He's a man of vision.  This country was built on 
[01:33:30]  half-assed things.  Like the guy who came up  with the thong.  He ran out of material  and used what he had.  Yeah.  Anthony Norton's not just a...  Holy shit.  Oh, boy.  Holy shit.  Oh, boy.  He ran out of material.  He had...  That's like a stand-up comedy line.  Yeah, that...  That's like a bad stand-up line.  I'm Ralph Cramden.  First of all,  no one should be 
[01:34:00]  trying to imitate  the great Jackie Gleason  ever.  He certainly doesn't seem  like he's trying.  That's just awful.  I mean, the line is really funny.  Yeah.  Laugh riot.  Just go...  Instead of watching the movie,  go rent...  Rent.  Go buy the box set.  Ed Norton's not just  a sanitation engineer.  I'm a specialist.  It's like I'm a brain surgeon.  I'm a Spider-Man.  He's a man of action. 
[01:34:30]  Two skeevers.  Look at him over there.  He'd like us to believe  they're over there  talking about religion  or politics.  You know how  they really care about it.  The assay is more  pinch-shaped.  Like the way  Shaka Khan  used to be back in the day.  Who'd been searching  everywhere.  Hey, sweet face.  Mom, Mom.  I thought you were Alice.  Uh-huh.  That's exactly  what a pervert would say.  For their one big race.  Damn, that dog can run.  Norton, that's it.  We race, Iggy. 
[01:35:00]  The dog's a straight-up dud.  This summer...  Table setting for three.  Does that mean  he's gonna be here?  He lives here.  Not for long.  If Jesus will quit  making movies  and answer the prayers  of a righteous woman.  They beg.  We gotta get  to owe some cash.  Jeannie Lincoln.  Remember we went  on a date  and it was supposed  to be Dutch  but I paid.  You got that  ten dollars for the movie?  And go for your dreams.  We're gonna sing  a lot of your  favorite tunes tonight.  You hired these guys 
[01:35:30]  as entertainment?  Why don't they  drink the entertainer?  There's something  really, really wrong  with you.  One day you are  gonna push me too far.  The only thing  that can push you  is a bulldozer.  My guess.  One line.  I don't believe  we've had the pleasure.  No, we haven't had  the pleasure  because if we had  been pleasant  I think we'd have  known about it.  Jabri O' Union.  Regina Hall.  Come on, Alex.  You got it.  Your man is trying.  Honey.  Look for the blind.  Anything can help.  Got a blind dog.  The Honeymooners. 
[01:36:00]  Ralph,  we gonna die.  I gotta confess  something to you.  One day I was  coming down  on the fire skate  and I seen  I was naked.  And sometimes  I think about it.  No!  No!  This trailer  is as long as the movie.  Wow.  And it  it will do well  at the box office.  No.  Why? 
[01:36:30]  Because the American public  is a bunch of dummies  and Monster-in-law  did well at the box office.  They're a bunch of dummies.  That is sacrilege.  Is that a bulldozer  line in the original  Honeymooners line?  That's a funny line.  Yeah.  The pushy was a bulldozer.  It's a bulldozer.  But it's so much funnier  in black and white.  It's just  it's a lot funnier  in the series.  You want to laugh  at the Honeymooners  get the Honeymooners.  The pushy was a bulldozer.  A bulldozer.  There was some funny shit 
[01:37:00]  in that shit.  Alright, well.  It's just  awful.  Oh, and they  goofed about how fat he was.  Oh, my God.  Hysterical.  What am I going to do  with Peanuts?  Eat them like any other elephant?  Like any other elephant.  That could be the greatest  smash in the face line  in history.  Alright, well.  Good luck to you  with that movie.  I guess a man  doesn't have to get fat  if he doesn't want to.  The mother-in-law  is just talking  right in front of him. 
[01:37:30]  Just bashing him.  Not even looking at him.  Like she would look  over him  and past him  not acknowledging  he's there.  Ugh.  God, it was a great show.  Really was.  To have this piece  of crap come out.  Alright, by the way,  I don't know what  the deal was  with Cinderella Man.  Yeah.  But there were reports  in the paper that  Russell Crowe  was all upset  at his bad reviews  and that's why  he went off  at the Mercer Hotel  the other day.  He's getting 83%  positive reviews  on Rotten Tomato. 
[01:38:00]  He's just an angry guy.  He's like one of those  drunk fighter guys.  Dude, he cried.  He likes to brawl.  Yeah, reports  from the precinct.  It says  Star was a crow baby  with police.  Crow baby.  Oh, God.  They've got to fit it in.  That's the New York Post  for you.  That's the headline.  Star was a crow baby  with police.  They put  Tyrius Maximus  tough guy actor  Russell Crowe  turned teary-eyed  and repentant 
[01:38:30]  after he was arrested  early Monday  for hurling a telephone  at a Soho Hotel  concierge.  Police sources  told the Post  his eyes watered  and he became  very upset  as he told detectives  at the first precinct  station house  about his past  rage-fueled outbursts  and problems  with anger management  sources said.  So he got all teary-eyed.  Guy's banged  half of Hollywood.  What's he crying about?  What's he throwing  phones for?  Unless they couldn't  connect him with a girl  he was supposed to fuck  that night.  Then he'd see him  getting a little angry. 
[01:39:00]  All right,  when we get back  we should talk about  Tom Cruise  and this Katie Holmes  thing.  Oh!  We got another  little thing  from little Marky  today.  I'm getting the feeling  that we ought to  get a van  and drive up  to Katie Holmes  and throw her  in the van  to deprogram her.  Aren't you getting  this creepy feeling  from reading this stuff  that she's  like being  taken by a cult  those Scientologists  have got a hold  of her  with one of their  head Scientologist 
[01:39:30]  guys  Tom Cruise  Good point Anthony  good point  Tom Cruise  John Travolta  they're all into  that kooky religion  you know most people  don't even know  what Scientology  is about  so you kind of  just blow it off  did you ever  research Scientology  and look into  what it really is?  No  It's crazy  this L. Ron Hubbard  guy  concocts this  wacky idea  actually he  elaborated a little  on some other  guy's idea  about space people  space people 
[01:40:00]  I like the  space people  angle  and how there's  like different  tribes of space  people  and exiled  space people  and you're  part of the  heritage of this  line of space  people  and you have to  cleanse your body  with these machines  and you just  keep pouring money  out  it's a cult  it is a cult  a very well  financed and  well publicized  cult  You don't believe  in space people?  No  I believe in space  people  Me too 
[01:40:30]  Not in the  context of  Scientology  I don't believe  L. Ron Hubbard  I don't believe  we're the only ones  Well I don't either  but I don't think  it's in line with  L. Ron Hubbard's  teachings  Dianetics  Scientology  I think the reason  we're here is  this is just  one big science  experiment  Whose project  is it?  Some teacher  Some teacher?  Are we cup of dirt?  From another planet  decided okay  your final exam  will be to  start a whole new 
[01:41:00]  life form  on another planet  and see what happens  That's all it is  That's all this is  Really?  Yeah  I think under  certain circumstances  life just pops up  and kind of  evolves based on  what happens  I think that's it  I think there's  plenty of these  little pockets  of whatever this is  elsewhere  that probably  don't even resemble  this  or you know  it's based on  circumstances  from another place  people that could  you know  not people  but some kind  of life form  that could survive  in a thousand 
[01:41:30]  degree heat  with ammonia  oceans  and stuff like that  and you know  they trot around  and go to work  or do whatever  the hell they do  I think it's just  you know  certain circumstances  kind of bubble  the little cauldron  and make life  and that's what we got  Well is there an  awareness of like  other things around it  like you know  if we were contacted  we'd probably be aware  that we were contacted  those other things  have an awareness  Oh maybe  maybe some of them  others maybe no  maybe you know  they walk amongst you  Right you gotta think  out of the box  maybe there's someone  sitting right next to you 
[01:42:00]  right now  in some other form  that we just don't  understand yet  Jimmy  Are you saying that  right here in another  dimension  there's an interesting  Bruce Kelly  Bizarro world  you gotta think  out of the box  you can't think  in our terms  it can be  some other thing  Yeah  that doesn't communicate  that has no reason  to communicate with us  doesn't need to  communicate with us  Yeah  Do you try to  communicate with  ants  Yes all the time  Yeah do you even  try to sit down  and have a conversation  with an ant  and make them  understand something  Every morning 
[01:42:30]  But just think that  just think that  us earth people  are the ants  and then we're  like from  you know  we're dudes  from another planet  Why would we  bother with the ants  Why would you bother  We already understand  what they're all about  and we don't care  about them  We're from some  planets so far  advanced that  we earthlings  are mere ants  Why bother  Because you know  ants communicate  right  Have you ever  received a message  from an ant  Beep deeep deeep deeep  Yeah but what is that  That message is  I'm going to take  a piece of your 
[01:43:00]  sandwich here  that you've placed  on the counter  Yeah  Move out of my way  We've got a cricket  to get back  to the ant hill  We're going to  conga line  this cricket  piece by piece  back to our hole  If you'll excuse me  Alright why don't we  break and we'll do  the Tom Cruise stuff  next I guess  And uh  God we do have  a lot to do  Uh  Uh  Alright  Like sand  through the hourglass  So is the  ONA virus

[01:47:00]  for many, many years  Alright, we got  Tom Cruise in the news  again  Tom Cruise all over  the place with  Katie Holmes  This is  and this is  what gets people  thinking Tom Cruise  might be gay  because anytime  he gets into  a relationship  it becomes a huge  publicity thing  for him  So you gotta start  thinking  you know  the guy's pretty smart  as far as getting  his name and  image out there  when he's got  a movie coming up  This seems to be 
[01:47:30]  a big publicity move  He's  so in love with her  He's going on  all the shows  professing his love  for her  and  these  relationships  seem to come up  when he really  needs them  You know  It's a little strange  Convenient  Oh, why'd you  take that picture off?  There you go  The Katie Holmes  picture from movie  Hawk  Which one?  The Gift  Thank you  MrSkin.com  It is a gift  for sure  when you see  You ass 
[01:48:00]  And then you get  the herpes mouth picture  Her with her  cold sores  around her mouth  With tits like that  I don't care  if her mouth  looks like  the salt sucking  monster from  Star Trek  Jesus  My God  You gotta be careful  though, Anthony  Imus had to  apologize  Yeah  Don Imus  had to apologize  because Sid  I'm sorry  Tom Cruise  is a faggot  No, no, no  You gotta  apologize  because Sid 
[01:48:30]  Oh, was that it?  Yeah, Sid said  that Tom Cruise  is gay  or something like that  Sid said  It was Sid?  Yeah, it was Sid again  Our old pal  Sid Rosenberg  who now doesn't  work for Imus anymore  Oh, what are they  doing showing Katie  below the waist  Look at the spread  She looks old, man  She really looks  old and frumpy  She was the perky one  Yeah  They used to  describe her as  perky  Now she's got that 
[01:49:00]  what they call  the secretary spread  When she sits down  it's just  wah  That's called  the secretary spread?  That's the secretary spread  Yeah, when they're  sitting down  and their  thighs and ass  is spread out  like way further  than it should be  in respect to their hips  and look  her boobs  don't look  And she dyed her hair  blonde to try  to look younger  And that dress  is atrocious 
[01:49:30]  and not young looking  No, she's wearing  this bright pink dress  and she dyed her hair  blonder  and it's just  not working  Alright, let's focus  Oh, focus  Tom Cruise  Imus  Yeah  We've got disturbing  news too  from Hollywood  I guess  What do you have  though over there?  By the way  it's a  Yeah  Careful  I'm not  I know  You tell me  this terrible story  the beautiful  hot steaming  Kylie Minogue  And a singer  Actually, she makes  these great videos 
[01:50:00]  She has breast cancer  It can be so beautiful  when a bitch  got bald head  and one titty  Oh, man  That was the comment  that got Sid fired  Yeah, that was  He said  Careful, Sid  Yeah, careful, Sid  He knows  Sid's mouth is like  explosives  You know what happened?  It's unfortunate  for Sid Rosenberg  He was doing  Thank you for pointing  at the TV  and distracting  all of us, Eric  Yeah, Eric  We can see the TVs  Thanks  Now what was I 
[01:50:30]  talking about?  Is that Diane Sawyer?  Yeah, she's jumping rope  She's jumping rope  And Katie's sitting  on a couch  Diane Sawyer  and the gang  They're just gonna kick  the Today Show's ass  Slowly but surely  They're now nipping  at their heels  Sorry again  Another distraction  What were we talking about?  Jesus  Tom Cruise  We already have ADD  on this show  Sid  Oh  And Ovi's just about 
[01:51:00]  to go  and I look at the TV  and see the leg  that fell out  of the plane story  All right  I can't focus  How can you?  Poor Mabel King  We have all this  good stuff  but now we just  gotta focus  and present it  to our fine listeners  Let's focus  Imus was apologizing  Because he said  something about  a leg falling  out of a plane?  What did he say?  It fell on Katie Couric  Oh my god  And that's what  the problem  with Scientology was  Right  They encourage you  to get in planes  and your legs fall out  Right  Well I was gonna  make a point about Sid 
[01:51:30]  and how you gotta  understand the environment  you're working in  and you know  Imus is now  more respected  and his show isn't  Well he's never  been a shock jock  Imus wasn't  a shock jock  and he's now  in the fancy  MSNBC studios  and there's a lot  more people  paying attention  to the show  and you got Sid  making these crazy  crazy comments  You gotta understand  They're gonna come  after you  after a while  Of course they are  And they finally  One titty  They finally went  after him  and unfortunately  Imus had to get 
[01:52:00]  rid of Sid  I don't think  Imus wanted to  get rid of Sid  but he had no choice  This isn't the first  time  He's been thrown  off the show  a couple of times  for his comments  but this one  looks pretty severe  So besides that  comment we just  played  Sid also talked  about how Tom  Cruise is gay  basically saying  he's gay  or whatever  and Imus had  to apologize  for that comment  and he read  a prepared  statement  so the lawyers  were nervous  enough to go  look Imus  and Imus  is his own  man  but they  like Imus  you better  read this  fucking thing  man  Tom Cruise  is very 
[01:52:30]  protective  about his  sexuality  if anybody  comes up  with the  if anybody  says he's  gay  in print  or on  TV  or the radio  he goes  after him  with his  lawyers  I don't blame  him actually  it's like  it's gotta be  I don't think  the guy  is gay  and it's gotta  be irritating  when you're  this sex symbol  and all these  stupid cock blocker  guys are saying  what a fag you are  and you're like  dude but I'm not  you're banging the hottest  chicks in Hollywood  and  yeah you're banging  Nicole Kidman  and they're still  calling you a moat  some ass life  is calling you a faggot 
[01:53:00]  if you're saying it  I don't think  if you're saying it  in humor  there's some weird law  which of course  Comedy Central  never cares about  don't mention product names  but uh  like where Joan Rivers  used to attack Liz Taylor  and there was some kind  of a thing  where if you're doing it  in humor  and it's parody  it's okay  it's all in the context  alright  do we have the Tom Cruise clips  so basically  in the post today  let's see  Katie Holmes  whirlwind romance  with Tom Cruise  is taking its toll 
[01:53:30]  on her friendships  and career Anthony  yeah  Holmes who is now  living with Cruise  in his Beverly Hills mansion  has stopped talking  to many of her old friends  who are not into  her new religion  Scientology  one friend who worked  with Holmes  on Pieces of April  said this relationship  is becoming a weird  is becoming as weird  as Liza Minnelli  and David Guest  it was exciting  at first  that Katie was dating Tom  but then when she  started drifting away  and I realized  it was because  we weren't into Scientology  it got a little weird  so uh 
[01:54:00]  other friends claim  they can't get Holmes  who has been  surrounded during her  Batman Begins junket  uh  at the Wilshire  by several Scientologists  including Cruise  to  and she's not  returning any calls  I'm just trying to  how old is she  and how old is he  it's like a 14 year difference  something like that  alright so  she pretty much  grew up  watching Tom Cruise  like every girl does  like this guy's great  I'm in love with this guy  that's like if I  if I was like you know  some hot actress  that I had been watching  wanted to start banging me  I'd do whatever religion  she was doing  who cares  yeah  like I mean I'm older 
[01:54:30]  than Jennifer Lopez  but if she said  look I'll sit on your face  you know  yeah but still  he's bigger than she is  he's way bigger than she is  well yeah  it's Tom Cruise  if he wanted me  to be a Scientologist  just to hang out with him  I would  you would do it  fuck yeah  it's Tom Cruise  I'd just march around with him  you'd think I'd fucking  walk in here  a little late  me and Tom were out  what  what are you gonna do  about it  let's go to the clips  we have on Gillette  what's the Oprah one  by the minute  remember he  do we ever hear that 
[01:55:00]  when he flicked out on Oprah  jumping up and down  on her couch  saying he loves Katie  someone said he made  a real ass out of himself  but I haven't heard it  without a camera rolling  and a script  he's a moron  most of them are  most of them are  they're these  remember artsy people  in school  people that were  in the drama club  and things like that  that's who all these  people are  they don't have real ideas  they're not  they're not the characters  you see them playing  in the movies  yeah  they're like these  weird friggin  spacey people 
[01:55:30]  by the way  Tom Cruise is 43  Katie Holmes is 26  17 year difference  and I say there's  nothing wrong with that  I completely agree  absolutely  I agree wholeheartedly  the only thing I see  wrong with it  it's not enough  years difference  a parent  a parent might have  a problem with that  but I say  screw the parents  there's nothing wrong  with that  that's right  that's what you have here  and you enjoy  the company of someone  I concur  to hell with the parents  you say to your friends 
[01:56:00]  right  that's right  that's it  what the heck  strong language  alright  I want to play  the delay clips  alright let's play  the first one here  no why  we're happy  why not share it  you know  I'm so happy  I'm so thrilled  and I mean  yeah I want to tell  the whole world  she's like a  Stepford wife  I'm already nauseous  though with the fact  that she said  I'm so thrilled  I'm thrilled  a Stepford wife  I am thrilled  I love Tom Cruise 
[01:56:30]  must give money  to Scientology  wait he's 43  when she's 27  I'm 26 right  so when she was 12  that's 14 years ago  he was what  29  right  no no  what I'm saying  is when she was  at that  impressionable age  you're right  you're right  yeah  like she was watching movies  this guy was a mega star  right  so she grew up  watching this guy  so you can't really  blame her  like I'm saying  her whole  teenage movie viewing life  has been watching him  right  basically when Tom Cruise  I don't like doing the math 
[01:57:00]  personally  math is pretty funny to do  yeah  when Tom Cruise  was graduating  let's say  high school  she was one  cool  nothing wrong  with having somebody  who's  alright let's move on  shall we  hold on  I used to go  to Watch Hill  out on Fire Island  for the summers  go out there  and we got a boat  and everything  and I heard  that at the time  I was going out there 
[01:57:30]  my girlfriend  her family  would also go out there  and I was  you know  in my mid-twenties  we used to play  in a band out there  and she was  eight years old  playing in the sand  with her little  pail and shovel  on the same beach  too bad you didn't  meet then huh  who said we didn't  eight years old  I would love to call you  a sick bastard  but I have no  right to stand on today  of course you don't  alright  I respect any relationship 
[01:58:00]  that starts off  with a Snickers bar  and a psst  why don't we go to  the second clip here  Anthony  I met Tom  one special day  in April  and I'm so in love  and he's the most  amazing man  in the entire world  I couldn't be happier  I just think it's funny  that right after  they met  she gets all  those freaking  cold sores  yeah  that's a little weird  that's the straps  of a new relationship  that's something that  inside edition  or whatever they're 
[01:58:30]  called inside Hollywood  accessed  whatever it is  access edition  access edition  they don't comment  about her  her cold sore face  Katie Holmes  cold sores  right  let's go deep  inside Katie Holmes  meow  and find out  what that virus  is y'all up  y'all  all right  let's go to  the volcano lip  third clip  I don't read that  because there's  so many people  that are so happy  for us  and it's like  great  that other stuff  who cares  what  who's happy 
[01:59:00]  for you  who  who  namely three people  that don't know you  that are happy  for you  we're all waiting  for this to turn  into a disaster  I'm happy for her  you're not happy  for her  you're happy  for him  happy for him  or happy for her  yeah I guess  I'm happy for him  you're right  let's go to the  fourth clip  I love that  I think that's great  and he's such a bright light  and he's such a wonderful  kind person  and I miss him 
[01:59:30]  when he leaves the room  I love him  you know what  it's emotionally healthy  maybe we should explain  the clips  instead of just playing them  randomly  yeah what the fuck  I'm listening  sorry Anthony  maybe I should set these up  a little better  maybe you should set it up  like they do on real shows  I know  like on real shows  they go  and Katie was asked  about  her feelings  about the movie  and this is what she said  you'll just play the clips  oh it's fantastic  well that was a little scary 
[02:00:00]  but we did get through it  what  what was  alright point made  Anthony  point taken  I should say  Holmes says she wouldn't  tone down  Cruz's exuberance  when he shows his love  for her  oh okay  like he's jumping up  and down on Oprah's  couch and stuff  right  is there clips  to that by the way  that we have  no  yeah we should have  why don't we have  that clip guys  that's one that we should have  had I think  yeah  I know it's tough  to get everything  but that was a big one  are all the clips played  huh  you played all the clips 
[02:00:30]  without explaining a one  that was a clip segment  yeah well  you would think  after the first one  you would go  I have no idea  what she's talking about  perhaps I need to  preface this with  what she's talking about  doesn't he go  I just love how you go  like real shows  like a real show  like we all  I've listened to real shows  like we all understand  that we're not really  doing a real show here  I know that  we try to make believe  sometimes  we're playing radio  right  and sometimes we  you know  get it right 
[02:01:00]  and most of the times  we're winging it  on a real show  they would have  prefaced those clips  I understand  and I bet you Nathaniel  over there is going  god damn it  introduce the clip properly  they taught me that  they teach you that  in school  Connecticut School of Broadcasting  alright well  um  give them all clips  of the Hindenburg disaster  and have them try to  preface it  like they're brand new  see because they  use dated stuff  over there  oh  how do you  how do you preface that  alright well  this is Ben Sparks 
[02:01:30]  his cock on fire  oh get out of the way  oh it's the worst  catastrophe I've ever seen  there are a number  of important persons  that's on board  and no doubt  the new commander  Captain Max Trish  has thrilled too  for this great moment  the first time  he's commanded  the Hindenburg  here comes the big  Jew hating balloon  chief officer  under Captain Lehman  it's practically  standing still  now they've dropped  ropes out of the nose  of the ship  and uh  it's been taken  a hold out  down on the field  by a number of men  it's starting to rain  again  the rain had 
[02:02:00]  cracked up a little bit  the back motors  of the ship  are just  holding it  making it  hurricane church  to keep it from  it's burst into flames  get out of the way  get out of the way  get it started  get it started  it's rising  and it's rising  it's rising  terrible  oh my  get out of the way  there's no cry  it's burning  bursting into flames  and it's falling  on the mooring  and all the folks  believe that  this is terrible  this is one of the worst  catastrophes in the world  oh it's  it's like  twenty  oh four or five hundred 
[02:02:30]  feet into the sky  and it  it's a terrific crash  ladies and gentlemen  the smoke and the flames  now  and the flame is crashing  to the ground  not quite to the mooring  mass  oh the humanity  and all the passengers  feeding around  I don't  I can't talk to people  and friends are on there  it's a  oh  I can't talk  ladies and gentlemen  honest  it's just like  they're massive  smoking wreckage  and everybody 
[02:03:00]  can't I be breathing  talking  lady  I'm sorry  stop it  radio started pretty much  with that clip  and this is where we are today  look at where we are  and even that guy 
[02:03:30]  didn't say  what the fuck  is your problem  whoa  wow  he didn't cry  that is the best point  ever  the guy was able  to hold it together  and not curse  crying  and he didn't  belt out profanity  yeah I think  whatever was the  governing body  back then  would have understood  if the guy  the  governing  oh  no I'm sure  the governing body  oh my god  oh no  Jimmy just turns his head 
[02:04:00]  I know you're already  looking at me  that looks  I saw it too  that's fine  governing body  yeah  who needs an  oh and the word  governing comes out  of his mouth  and oh  it bursts into flames  oh it's destroyed  the human language  is getting destroyed  oh the human  animony  you just drop  certain letters  once in a while  that's alright  yeah you know  you silly anger  who needs all  26 letters  oh  boy that guy  came apart  at the seams  but I'm just saying 
[02:04:30]  what I want to say  is that  yeah  he should have been  able to  throw an F word  out there  when you go  holy shit  that thing is  in flames  who would have  found that guy  for that  you know  oh get out of the way  professional broadcaster  it burst into flames  that was just great  yeah  you keep like  what he's saying  it's already been  grabbed by people  there were people  that survived that though  yeah  some people died  some people made it  through  it didn't even look  like anyone  should have lived  through that  a big Jew  hating balloon  a big Jew  hating balloon 
[02:05:00]  fucking swastika  on it  was it  yeah  what year was that  moseying over  what was that  30  I want to say 6  but I'm not sure  when was it  anyone  Nathaniel  you're a pretty smart guy  no  don't know when  the Hindenburg crashed  wait you had another clip  what was that  if you wanted to replay  why would we replay  why would we replay it  Hawk  alright let's go to Tom Cruise  on Access Hollywood  we have him on Oprah  talking about Scientology  no we don't 
[02:05:30]  let's get that  here's the first clip  I don't know what  it's about  it's been more than  four years  since Tom Cruise  and Nicole Kidman  went their separate ways  yet people are still  fascinated by their relationship  what went wrong  could it have been saved  as our Cruise  exclusive continues  Tom tries to clear up  some  of the mystery  is or was  Nicole  ever a Scientologist  no  is that part of the  reason why  you're no longer together 
[02:06:00]  because you're raising  your children  no  Hollywood's golden couple  Tom Cruise  and Nicole Kidman  have separated  Tom and Nicole  split 11 years  as expected  the Cruise Kidman  breakup unleashed  a headline guessing game  Scientology  was often cited  I definitely respect  other people's beliefs  and what  however they want to live  I mean there's tools  that she's used  in her life  absolutely  what's wrong with that  what he just said there 
[02:06:30]  is not even  that's a pretty normal  thing to say  yeah I guess  we don't have to go  through these clips  no no I want to hear him  I just want to hear  what he said about Scientology  he just didn't say  anything about Scientology  no they never do  let's try this one  Tom you adopted children  why did you  I mean that is  really  opening up  no Nick and I  you are  no Nick and I  wanted to  someone said to me  and I just  was like  well when are you  going to have  your own children  you know  do you think  you'll have your own  I said  I have my children  you don't get it  there's no way 
[02:07:00]  and I must tell you  when I  when I held my daughter  you know  when we adopted  Bella first  as much as I realized  how  that level  of reality  and affinity  and love  that I had  for my mother  there's nothing  like when you  hold your own  child you go  my gosh  wow  I just love  but unlike their mother  the children  are Scientologists  with my children  you know  like anything  I believe  it's their choice  on what they want  to do  and they are  Scientologists  they are  oh yeah  and is Nicole 
[02:07:30]  fine with that  she's the other half  absolutely  absolutely  Nick and I  are very much  you know  I really  I think we're  doing a great job  raising our children  because  right from the beginning  the thing that  that I do admire  you know  about Nick  is that  it's the respect  of someone else's beliefs  you know  she's not a bigot  Nick's not a bigot  what  Nick's not a bigot  you know  he's not talking  about the Apollo  but that was a total 
[02:08:00]  totally  completely normal  things to say  he's not really  talking about Scientology  in some weird way  it's my belief  it's her belief  they never do  they try to  and believe me  there's probably  closed door meetings  with these  high echelon  Scientologists  like him  and John Travolta  that how  Scientology  is presented  through them  they don't want  these guys  to look like  they're brainwashed  zombies  you know  preaching the words  of L. Ron Hubbard  they want it to sound like  hey  it's your choice 
[02:08:30]  it's this that  but once you get in there  and if you're a high profile  guy like that  with a lot of money  that church is  the money  that is pouring  into the  Scientology churches  they have compounds  and churches  all over the place  big huge buildings  it's amazing  yeah Tom Cruise  took a  what was it  a tour  the star recently  gave an unprecedented  six hour tour  of three of  Scientology's  facilities  to a  details writer  so I guess 
[02:09:00]  they're going to do  a story on it  and details  and I think  guys like him  I think guys  like him  and Travolta  have at least  been involved  for many years  Travolta's been  there for 20 years  before it was  fashionable to do  so many of these  young actors  now just do it  as a place  to network  because they think  it's the key  to the kingdom  a lot of them  go to certain  recovery meetings  in LA  because they think  that's where  you're going to  meet some producers  douchebags  yeah I mean  not good for the  right reasons  I went to  Kabbalah  myself  is that what  you're into  these days  oh yeah  yeah  me and Esther  I have no idea  you and Esther  aka Madonna 
[02:09:30]  I don't call her that  you call her by  whatever name you are  I call her Esther  I respect that  we got another  jingle that came in  from Brother Joe  anyone hear this  it's an old one  oh this is an old one  it's an old one  how old Eric  it's not important  huh  it's not important  Norton  angry comic  make you laugh  so hard  you'll vomit  Norton  angry comic  he's so pissed off  hmm  it's a Norton one  I don't understand it  it kind of works though 
[02:10:00]  you're angry  alright  I'm not in a good mood  Joe  why don't we take  another break  Anthony  when we come back  we'll finish up the news  editor of Sink Magazine  is that him  that's him  who are you  I don't see anyone  on the left  delicious youngster  sitting outside  that guy  messy hair  that's a chick  no there's a guy  there's a guy next to him  there's a guy way over there  yeah  alright  we got the guy  from Sink Magazine  coming in a little bit  uh huh 
[02:10:30]  wait I was just  oh I know you  that guy's actually  very cool  yes  alright  we'll talk to  it's Tony right  yeah we'll talk to  Tony from Sink Magazine  next  also  you want to do  the leg story  before we go to break  then  yeah  where's that news story  that's a cute story  this is the story of the day  in our opinion  no I mean the Dillette story  oh there's uh  it's in Dillette  we actually have a clip  yes we have a clip  oh 
[02:11:00]  from a legitimate news organization  yes  yes  we get that  do you want to set it up Anthony  well um  body parts  falling from the skies  eyes over Long Island  New York  Opie  seems a man's  severed leg  no I was going to play  the clip  and then we go there  oh that's all you needed  from me  yeah  yeah  jeez  alright here's the setup  actually  I got the setup  I'm not needed at all  I got the uh  the cue sheet  as they call it  in the business 
[02:11:30]  ooh  uh  Hearn says  part of a man's body  bounced off the roof  of her garage  and landed in her backyard  there's one large  uh  body part  um  it's the entire leg  the entire torso  the entire hip  and  half of a  spinal cord  oh  and this clip says  Hearn says  she heard a loud crash  a little before 7 a.m  but she didn't find out  what caused it  until late morning  I heard something this morning 
[02:12:00]  I didn't think anything of it  it could have been my neighbors  loading furniture in  something very hard  so body parts  are falling out of the sky  Anthony  yeah  alright  yeah  seems uh  that this leg  which was attached  as she said  to a hip  part of the uh  torso  and half a spine  fell  from uh  what appears to be  a um  South African jetliner  about to land  at Kennedy Airport  that's what happened  apparently someone's 
[02:12:30]  trying to hitch a ride  yeah  someone's trying to  hitch a ride  from South Africa  uh  they do this  every so often  some people make it  some people don't  some people freeze  to death up there  this guy apparently  jumped in the um  in the works  for the landing gear  and when the landing gear  pulled up  uh  he was not out of the way  and got stuck  in the gears  and hydraulics  and uh  things that make  the landing gear  go up and down  you wonder if it  it hurt  or if it just  killed him instantly  if you're being ripped  in two  or at least two 
[02:13:00]  it probably hurt  for a very short  period of time  yeah you're alive  long enough  to know that  a big part of your  body is now falling  I don't think  you have enough time  to go  holy shit  I'm being cut in half  by a landing gear  I think you get  holy  maybe  where's the upper half  from inside the plane  uh  well that's uh  that uh  could have fallen out  or they said  some parts were still  inside the plane  that they had a hose out  they told passengers  who were supposed to  board the plane  after it landed  uh  that the plane  was uh  being delayed 
[02:13:30]  for maintenance  didn't tell them  what  it said  maintenance  get out the big hose  get out the hose  down and get those  damn passengers  on board  we got money to make  but it's minus  30 degrees  at that height  sometimes  right  minus 40 degrees  when you're at that  when you're  recruiting out  colder than that  it could get  very very cold  uh  you got no air  up there  uh  and the  the great part  is uh  a  a white  adidas sneaker  was still  neatly tied  to the foot  of this  uh  leg  and hip 
[02:14:00]  that fell  to the uh  to the ground  like in jaws  remember that  oh yeah  when the guy  got uh  you kids  okay over there  and the shark  bit his leg off  and his  and it fell  and it fell  down  that uh  sneaker tied  to it  at the time  it looked so  real but now  you look at that  scene and the  leg looks so  fake  does it  i think so  yeah  uh  well  hearn  uh  who discovered  this says  uh  at first  saw the leg  in the grass  it didn't  look real  but authorities  assured  uh  the special ed  teacher  it wasn't a  cruel joke  she said 
[02:14:30]  it was very  blackened  as if it  had been  charred  victim  apparently  stowed away  uh  crawled into  the wheel  well  of the jet  when it took  off from  dakar  senegal  and uh  they said  that her  house is  kind of  right under  where they  open up  their landing  gear to  to land  at kennedy  airport  and boom  there it  goes  the body  was badly  battered  the clothing  shredded  and the  plane was  battered  from the  body parts  so i guess  they did  have to  fix some  stuff in  the plane 
[02:15:00]  must have  tore up  something  in there  with his  bones  digging into  the metal  probably a  ligament  got caught  a wire  dented up  some of  the metal  for landing  your door  maybe  well do you  think that it  actually closed  and just killed  him instantly  or maybe he  got ripped apart  when it opened  somehow  oh man imagine  he made it  finally i am  going to be  free  he's ripped  to shreds  or maybe his  one leg  was just  maybe it  closed on  his leg  and he was 
[02:15:30]  like say from  the knee down  was trapped  in the landing  gear  screaming for  help and no  one could hear  him for  12 hours  yeah  and then when  it opened  maybe it  just ripped  his body  in half  maybe  oh pounded  on there  somebody help  me  hey could  you uh  i'm stuck  in here  don't don't  put the landing  gear down  do people i guess  people that do  this don't do  any research  no  that the landing  gear compartment  is is not  pressurized  and uh there's  no heat in there  how much room do you 
[02:16:00]  have to move  around in  are you insane  this guy  talks with  clicks and  clacks  you want him  to do  research  maybe  i don't know  is there a  click clack book  on uh landing  gear that this  guy could have  read beforehand  if you understand  the concept that  we have machines  that fly in the  air  you know  then perhaps  you can uh  do a little  research  they don't  understand  you've seen  the movie  the gods must  be crazy  right  yeah  with the uh  the pepsi bottle 
[02:16:30]  thing  coke  oh it's coke  uh anthony in a  related story  this just in  hitting the wire  it says ap  gotta be true  then  shark attack  yes  surf city uh  new jersey  it could be  new jersey's first  shark attack in  30 years anthony  a 17 year old  surfer ryan horton  was catching some  waves near surf  city on long beach  island when he  felt the pain in  his ankle he  described as being 
[02:17:00]  hit by a baseball  bat  horton paddled  back to shore and  his brother took  him to the hospital  there his bloody  wound about three  and a half inches  long and one inch  wide was sewn up  with more than  50 stitches  three and a half  inches wide and  one inch  that's not a  the surfer never  saw what got him  but his mom sent  a picture of the  bite to a shark  expert in florida  the verdict  the expert said  it was a classic  shark bite  probably from a  young great white  oh stop it  surf city officials  say from time to 
[02:17:30]  time shark encounters  are inevitable  living by the  ocean  yeah  those beaches  will stay open  it's 4th of july  look fellas  let's be reasonable  this is not the  time nor place  to perform some  kind of a  half-assed autopsy  on a fish  and i for one  won't stand by  while you cut  that thing open  and see that  little kitner boy  spill out all  over the dock  the mayor

[02:20:30]  XM202.  Go and save yourself.  And take it on me.  Go and save yourself.  And take it on me.  Ah, PBJ.  I'm trying something different.  Ooh, peanut butter and jelly? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Eating peanut butter and jelly.  First day of my new thing.  What's the new thing?  Like eat lunch stuff.  That seems like a really nice little snack right now.  I mean, we get up at what?  I get up at 5 in the morning.  Asshole.  It's 4 1⁄2 hours since I've been awake.  And for some reason, because it's morning for everybody else, I feel like I have to eat morning food the whole morning we're here.  But that doesn't make sense because now it's kind of lunch for us.  That's right.  So I'm trying to eat like lunch now. 
[02:21:30]  I eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  I eat my lunch in the morning.  See, I eat my lunch with like I'll have tuna or turkey or something in the morning.  And then when I get home, you know what I have?  A bowl of cereal.  I'm insane.  I'm a crazy person.  Obviously.  Look at the shirt you're wearing today.  It's very festive, bright, and summery.  What do you have when you get home?  A nice drug cocktail?  Travis, Robon.  What color is that shirt?  Uh, that's a light blue with some pink.  Pink?  Travis, there is no pink on this shirt. 
[02:22:00]  Looks pink from here.  This is peach.  Mm-mm.  And this is seafoam green.  Of course it is.  He's saying that's a blue shirt.  And this is blue.  It's lavender.  Lavender, seafoam, and pink.  That is not lavender.  And pink.  I won't give you the pink, Anthony, even though it's close.  It's more of a peach.  It's peach.  Peach is worse.  Eric, what color is the other shirt?  Lavender.  Shut up, would you?  Go ahead.  Lavender, lime, and peach.  It is not lavender.  Lime.  He called it lime.  Ugh. 
[02:22:30]  I said lime green.  He says it's seafoam or something like that.  I want an example.  I'm going to images, Google.  How do you spell lavender?  Could someone take a picture of just Anthony's shirt?  Q-U-E-E-R.  I want to save him the embarrassment, so don't even get it.  No.  Look at lavender.  Let me see lavender.  Look at lavender.  See?  Yeah, that's close.  No.  This is blue.  Let me see.  Thank God you only wear stuff once, so we'll never see the shirt again. 
[02:23:00]  Dude, I watch everyone's rotation around here.  I mean, Norton, just don't even get his face, because I'm trying to save him the embarrassment.  All right.  Now get that shirt up online.  Look, everyone's taking pictures of you and your shirt.  But it's not lavender.  See?  If you look at the lavender on the website here, you'll see that it's purple.  It's close enough.  Everyone's just flashing away.  You may want to save him the embarrassment, but I don't. 
[02:23:30]  Blue.  Blue.  Let me see.  Oh.  You stink.  The best part, though, is Anthony doesn't wear anything twice.  I've never seen a rotation come around with your clothes.  I burn them to keep the germs off of me.  Looks kind of more like blue in this photo.  I got it.  Of course it's blue.  But in real life, it looks more lavender.  I'll try it out of the flesh.  Lavender is a blue.  Nathaniel, what's the color?  What are the colors of Anthony's shirt today?  With a little red added to it?  Is that what lavender is?  This is...  Whose side do I want to come on? 
[02:24:00]  If you say this is lavender, you're wearing a lavender shirt.  Look at the colors.  I enjoy your blue shirt, sir.  Thank you, Nathaniel.  If only for self-defense.  Thank you.  See?  It's the same color blue.  Wait, now you're claiming that Nathaniel has the same color shirt as you?  Get next to him.  This will prove my point.  Get right behind him.  Because Nathaniel's now...  Nathaniel's wearing a blue shirt.  That is blue.  Now look at the blue on this.  But notice I have white in with the blue.  That is the same color blue. 
[02:24:30]  I rest my case.  No, his is darker.  No, it isn't.  That's just because I have some white.  No, his is definitely more manly.  Yours is yours.  Mine is not a solid blue.  Your blue is missing some T-cells.  There's white spots and white stripes over here.  Yeah, all right.  Sure, why not?  Yeah.  Your blue is too weak to answer the door.  I have to have a friend come over and make it broth.  Brought.  Brought.  Your blue should be tied to a fence in Wyoming. 
[02:25:00]  Jesus.  It's a wonderful blue.  It's not lavender.  Oh, things just keep getting better.  You suck.  And I really think this shirt will set the whole look off.  Faggot.  Didn't they do a Queer Eye thing with the Boston Red Sox recently?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:25:30]  That was their...  Yeah, they took, like, Johnny Damon and a couple of the other guys and gave him a little  makeover.  They didn't cut his hair, though.  Let's go to Krista in Jersey.  Krista, what's up?  Hi.  Hey.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Hello.  Anthony, I haven't seen your shirt, but I am going to guess that the color is actually  periwinkle, which is pretty gay.  Oh, my God.  Is there an actual color called periwinkle?  It's not...  Periwinkle.  Periwinkle.  You can punch up periwinkle, and I bet you, sight unseen, that is the color of your shirt. 
[02:26:00]  Periwinkle?  Oh, my Lord.  Let me see.  Hold on.  Periwinkle.  Uh-oh.  It's not saying no.  All right.  It might be periwinkle.  Oh, my God.  You're wearing periwinkle.  Oh, you have a periwinkle?  Hey, periwinkle with...  Periwinkle.  You're wearing periwinkle with a peach, tiny stripe, and a foam green stripe.  See, foam green, periwinkle, and peach.  Periwinkle looks a little too lavender still. 
[02:26:30]  I don't know.  For me.  This is blue.  It's fucking blue.  Dude, I will take away that I think it looks lavender, if you'll admit it's periwinkle.  It is periwinkle.  It's more periwinkle than lavender.  I think it's periwinkle.  I think it's blue.  Steve.  I'd say blue.  Steve, what's the color of his shirt?  Periwinkle or blue?  Be honest.  Don't be a pussy like everyone else around here.  What's the color?  What is it?  I just looked at some periwinkle online.  That's pretty close to periwinkle.  It's not periwinkle.  It is.  What about those stripes that go through the whole shirt? 
[02:27:00]  The stripes?  Pink and green.  No, it's pink.  It's peach.  Atta boy.  It's peach.  You know, my sister-in-law had a wedding.  I was in the wedding and the dresses were periwinkle.  All right.  This guy wants to spell lavender for Anthony.  Let's go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Hi, guys.  Anthony asked earlier how to spell lavender.  Yeah.  G-A-Y. 
[02:27:30]  The beauty, though, he'll never wear this shirt again.  He doesn't wear anything twice.  I will wear this at some point.  And if you don't wear it, just make it into a bumper sticker and put it on the back of  your car.  A little rainbow shape.  Take that shirt and make a quilt patch.  A quilt.  There's a society called the Periwinkle Communique.  It's a color.  It's exactly the same.  No.  It is.  That's more purple.  It's purple. 
[02:28:00]  This is blue.  There is no mistaking this isn't blue.  Periwinkle.  That's Periwinkle.  She nailed it.  That fine woman nailed it.  It's Periwinkle.  I'll give you Periwinkle, Anthony.  I'll take the lavender away.  Periwinkle, sea foam green and pink.  What about that?  It's a fine shirt.  Periwinkle isn't even a color.  Do you realize a slip is a more masculine shirt?  I like my summery shirt.  I think it's great.  It should be a little longer. 
[02:28:30]  You should come down to maybe your mid-knees.  Anthony, fashion's all about taking chances, and I want to congratulate you on taking a chance  today.  I'm taking chances out there.  God, you know, I walked in.  I'm barely awake, but I noticed your shirt.  Oh, I know.  And Anthony was already prepared with the comebacks and everything.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Ah, yeah.  He just goes, ah, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  It's colorful.  I got you.  I'm on it.  I dressed myself this morning. 
[02:29:00]  I know what I put on.  Very colorful.  It's a nice shirt if you're going boating with a bunch of male friends and you watch the  Tonys.  You think Nathan Lane's a hoot, do you?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  All right, Ant.  Oh, Jesus.  Enjoy the next hour and a half with your little periwinkle shirt.  Rob from Cherry Hill.  I've never heard a man defend that his shirt is not gay by screaming, it's peach. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, I know the peach doesn't really take away from...  Yeah, I can't.  I'm trying to think if I have anything that has peach on it.  Yeah, probably not.  Not at all.  All right, why don't we get Tony in here?  Tony Raimondo from Sink Magazine.  We like Sink Magazine.  Yeah.  Tony with the wild hair.  I like Sink because it's all about gadgets.  It's all about gadgets and electronics and fun things that I love, love spending money on. 
[02:30:00]  Sometimes a little too highbrow for me because I'm a dummy when it comes to tech stuff, but  getting more and more into the magazine there, Tony.  I got to tell you.  The whole premise, I think, is to kind of dumb it down so people can, you know, because  you can get PC mag or something if you really know your shit.  Right.  I think that, you know, as we go, some stuff's just technical, it's just the way it is, but  for the most part we try to bring it down so the normal guy can figure it out.  It's like fashion, you know, you try to match a belt to a pair of shoes, it's tough  for guys.  Are you trying to convey this to me? 
[02:30:30]  No.  Is that a jab at me, my friend?  Tony, what's the color of that shirt?  Periwinkle in pink.  It's blue and peach.  It's a good looking shirt.  It certainly is.  Thank you.  What about that other stripe?  What would you call that?  What's one?  The other one.  Yeah, I'm not sure about that.  It's some kind of Mary Kay green.  It's sea foam.  Mary Kay green.  It's sea foam green.  Sea foam.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's a good looking shirt.  I like it.  Thank you. 
[02:31:00]  I'm losing this battle.  Oh, please.  Just admit it and then we move on.  Don't you understand?  Just admit it.  You probably told yourself in the mirror that it was kind of like a blue, green, and red shirt.  Blue, green, and red.  That's what it is.  Yeah, just like blue, green, and red.  Blue, green, and red.  That's what I said this morning.  And now it's periwinkle, sea foam green, and peach.  Are you playing golf right after the show?  No.  No, I'm not.  All right.  It's a good summer shirt.  I'm going to change my shirt, though. 
[02:31:30]  All right, so Sync Magazine.  We're looking at the latest issue.  And actually, we're in it because they compare satellite companies.  Oh.  Battle of Satellite Radio on, what page are we on?  Kind of mentions us in the shock jock genre.  XM has us, and a little doggy company will have Howard in the beginning of 06.  I invented a technology.  But that's pretty cool.  Yeah, you know, I mean, it's up for debate. 
[02:32:00]  A lot of people want to know between XM and Sirius as it gets more popular.  You know, we're just trying to give them nuts and bolts.  People will pick what they want, depending on what they want.  Well, XM has much better technology at this point, much better.  And much better content, I must say, as well.  That's right, damn it.  And I think for Sync and the Reno Sync, it's mostly, you know, it's the stuff that you can get with it, the stuff you can listen to it on, whether it's portable or not.  I think we also did, you know, the portable, like...  Oh, I saw that.  Like, you tested out the MiFi? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  In Denver and New York City?  Yeah, so we took it to, like, mine shafts down on the subway.  And, you know, it works pretty well.  Well, you know that satellite radio can't work in subways yet.  No, but I think the, you know, the overall test was, I think, you know, what's up for debate is how spotty the service is on the portable version.  And, I mean, it did really well.  But, you know, you've got to take it to a certain extreme just to give people the feeling that you actually used it and didn't just fake it.  I've got to tell you, I do have a, you know, MiFi, I use it every day, and I just don't have any problems with it whatsoever in Manhattan.  And I know I work for the company, so, you know, but I'm not giving the company line. 
[02:33:00]  It rarely craps out, and if it craps out, it craps out for a couple seconds tops.  Yeah, I mean, I don't think it's any different than cable or anything else that, you know, whatever you're using, I mean, you're always going to have problems.  But when you put something in, and what we try to do is give it to real guys to test all the products, because if you put it in the hands of some reviewer,  he's going to take the piss out of it because that's what he thinks he needs to do.  You know, no different than a record review or a movie review.  It is kind of funny, though, because in the New York City test, I guess you guys went to the top of the Empire State Building.  You think it would have an unobstructed signal on the Empire State Building's 86th floor, but the device just went kaput. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  It doesn't work on the 86th floor, huh?  I mean, it might have been some kind of alien ways, but, you know, that's exactly it.  That seems a little weird.  You know, you would think in an open field or high above, you know, no obstruction, but it's just not the case.  But how many days, you know, you're not really going to stand up there and listen all day anyway, so who gives a shit,  as long as you can walk down the street and it works.  Yeah, I can walk right through Times Square and my MiFi works just fine.  So what else is in the latest issue of Sink Magazine there, Tony?  All kinds of stuff.  I think one of the things we try to do is not just show the gadgets but kind of get to the lifestyle of it. 
[02:34:00]  And what we realized, we did a survey a couple months ago, and we realized that, you know,  women, girlfriends, wives are fantastic at catching guys who cheat based on their emails, their text messages, voicemails.  Guys get very sloppy.  Guys are stupid, you know.  They get drunk.  They send that text booty call at midnight.  They don't forget, you know, they forget to delete it.  But women are pretty fastidious about it.  Like, what we found out was they, you know, they know all of our passwords, you know, whether it's PIN codes, passwords to computers, email. 
[02:34:30]  Because we're dumb.  We use our birthdates.  Because that's the only thing we can remember.  It is.  It's always dogs' names, birthdates.  It's so obvious.  It's never the girl that you're actually cheating with.  Hey, my password's Greg.  No one will figure that one out.  But they're pretty quick at it.  And we realized that they all know, you know, they all check.  Whether you're not cheating or you are cheating, they're always looking.  Dig into your email and take a little peek around, see what's going on.  Absolutely.  And I think the actual number is 76% of all women go through all of your stuff to see if you cheat. 
[02:35:00]  But, you know, women are, you know, if you think your woman's cheating, there's a good chance she is.  But the reality of it is, like, women will, they'll do their cheating text message.  If she's cheating with you or cheating with a guy from work, she's going to text him after work when they split up.  Like, we do the old midnight thing, you know, when you're drunk and you think you want to hook up.  But women are a little, you know, they're a little closer home.  They're not going to do it when they're home watching TV like a guy will.  So if you think she's cheating, the time to check on her phone or her email is right after work when she gets home. 
[02:35:30]  Because what all the women said was the minute they walk out the door, you know, they get that separation anxiety.  But then once they get home and start going about their daily business, whether it's, you know, watching Law and Order or cooking, you know, they kind of forget about it.  Hmm.  Depends.  If you guys are cheating.  Which one of you guys are cheating?  I don't think anyone's cheating.  Jimmy, Jimmy, it doesn't matter.  Right, exactly.  Yeah.  I'm not cheating.  Opie.  No reason to.  No cheating.  I did realize this recently. 
[02:36:00]  Nathaniel, cheating?  No?  You got a girlfriend, Nathaniel?  Yes.  Oh, you do?  All right.  That's nice.  Yes.  Yes, I do.  All right.  Very nice young lady.  How long?  It'll be three years in July.  Oh, very good.  Yes.  And no cheating going on there, right?  Well, no.  Well, no.  No, but I'm willing to learn.  Plus, yeah.  Plus, living together, it's not really an option anyway.  Nor a desire.  Very good.  Nor a desire.  I'm just going to blow this somehow. 
[02:36:30]  You ever feel like, I know there are some times that I, like I'll get a business card  or a number at an appearance or something.  Never a chick's number or anything like that.  Usually it's, you know, one of the dopey guys that say, I make t-shirts or something like  that.  And they'll write a number on the back of their card and I'll take that.  And then, like once in a blue moon, my wallet's out and if your girlfriend starts going through  your wallet, you're thinking like, oh, I got to make an excuse for that.  I got, like this guilt thing, even though there's, you're not doing anything, like this 
[02:37:00]  guilt thing comes over at you.  But, one time, or a couple of times, I've told my girlfriend, yeah, go into my email  and find this, you know, if I can't get into it or I call her up and go, yeah, go into  my email and find this email.  And even though I know there's nothing going on, I'm like, there's nothing in there that  I'm going to have to explain or anything.  Yeah, you start thinking about it.  You just get the guilt thing.  It's like I was talking about when you walk into a store and don't buy anything and you 
[02:37:30]  go to leave, you got to hang out for a while and make it, yeah, you get the guilt thing.  Right, right, right.  Well, you know, weird.  One of the things that women, how they bust most guys is exactly what you said.  Like, they'll be like, listen to this voicemail I got and they'll punch in their, you know,  their code on their cell phone and women record that stuff.  They're just so smart and the same with the email.  But, you know, it is one of those things.  Once you open the door, they kind of flood right in.  Yeah.  Well, once you give them the codes or passwords or stuff like that, you could give it to them once. 
[02:38:00]  Go, yeah, could you check this message for me?  And then they have it.  Believe me, they're not going to forget it.  And if they ever want to look in your email after that, they can look.  Yeah.  You've got nothing to hide, nothing to worry about.  That's right.  Most men have something to hide, I think, though.  Most, do you think?  I think most.  Yeah.  How come anyone you would ask would say, no, they have nothing to hide?  Because they're hiding.  Someone's lying.  Because they're hiding it.  Because they're hiding it.  Someone's internet browser history reveals some things.  Oh, that's another thing.  Internet browser history. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Clear history quick.  You should have said it to clear history every time you sign on.  A lot of people are really stupid when it comes to browsing.  They have no idea what's being stored up on their computer.  Oh.  As far as not even like porno pictures or anything like that.  But just where you've been, what you've downloaded, all that is recorded.  For the next, for our next issue, actually, we bought 100 computers off of eBay and from  Oh, wow.  That's great.  Donated them to charity.  So we got 100 computers.  See what's on them? 
[02:39:00]  We sent it to an FBI lab upstate.  And they've been pulling all the information.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I mean, we're getting pictures of, you know, the dirtiest pictures you can possibly imagine.  Text messages, affairs, like, I mean, forget the credit card information, all the money,  like, all the stuff, but just stupid, like, cheesy emails, you know, those, like, dear  pookie to someone they're cheating, I can't believe we're cheating, I want to hook, you  know, the Pat O'Brien voicemail.  What kind of ass would be, I can't believe we're cheating, right?  You know, all the guilty stuff, but all this great information.  We're cheating. 
[02:39:30]  We're cheating.  You're cheating.  I'm cheating.  We're just cheating.  People are so dumb.  Why do they reformat those hard drives before they send them back?  Now, people are too dumb.  I mean, people don't.  The average person doesn't know that.  You know, they put their crap on eBay.  They sell it.  It's gone.  So I pull the hard drive right out.  Yeah, we were talking about that recently.  I mean, because it goes back to the whole guilt thing.  You just wonder, what is actually in?  And I got a new computer recently.  I left it out in the rain.  I smashed it with a freaking...  The old one?  Yeah.  I smashed it with a sledgehammer.  I did all sorts of stuff to it. 
[02:40:00]  Because, like, what could possibly be in there that I don't know about?  I pull the hard drives out, and then you just, like, drill holes in them, and it's done.  Do all sorts of things.  Yeah, you do whatever you're...  Magnetize it.  Take a bulker for the old carts that the radio station used to use.  And then you put a blowtorch to it.  And then what you've got to do is blow it up with some dynamite.  Right.  Get some tin snips.  We're actually...  We're going to call all the people who left all the dirty emails and all the pictures  and try to get them to comment.  That is a great bit.  I like that.  That's pretty good.  I like that.  You know, there's something about computers and sex and cheating and goofy stuff that 
[02:40:30]  goes a long way.  Do you find any illegal shit, like kiddie porn, that type of stuff?  Yeah, I don't know.  That you can get somebody busted on?  That, I'm not sure.  You know, I mean, you'd be...  I mean, I think everyone's doing something kind of shady at times, but we haven't gotten that far into  it, and some of that stuff is just tough for us to print and sync.  But, I mean, if we find it, I'll send it over.  No, no, I don't want it.  I'm saying the FBI can contact, can get the people who had it.  I would imagine.  I mean, I got to imagine there's something on there that's going to get someone in trouble.  Computers have become...  Like, early on, years and years ago, when they said that someday, you know, everybody was 
[02:41:00]  going to have computers in their home, and you really couldn't place why you would need  a computer in your house.  Like, people always said that we would have them, but there was no reason.  Yeah.  And then, slowly, as we got computers, everyone got them in their house, you realize, yeah,  emails and the availability of knowledge that's right there at your fingertips.  If you had those questions about a movie that used to bug the shit out of you for days on  end...  That's not why people buy their computers to begin with, though. 
[02:41:30]  Eventually, you discover all that stuff.  Yeah.  People bought their computers at first just to get the smut into their homes.  Yeah.  Smut.  Well, you don't have to walk into some kind of peep show, freaking movie place.  It's under the guise, first, of business, because they showed up in the workplace first,  replacing the typewriter, word processor.  You got the computer, and then realized what was available to you online.  That is the whole thing.  Once they connected, once you connected the computers, then there was a reason for everybody  to have them, but they've become such a part of who you are. 
[02:42:00]  It's no longer just like a machine.  Each one is very personal and has pieces of your personality on them, your emails, what  you enjoy downloading, music, pictures.  You can learn more about that.  So now you can learn...  Right.  That's exactly what I'm getting to.  You can learn more about somebody from their computer than you could in the past by any  other means, you know?  It used to be the car, your clothes, your car, where you live, but now you can really  tap into someone's brain. 
[02:42:30]  Now you know exactly.  And your information is there, your hard information as far as credit cards and bank accounts and  things like that.  I mean, your whole life is on these boxes.  And when people throw it away, they don't realize, you know, you're putting all this  information, a part of who you are, is now being thrown out there on the street for anyone  to just pick up or buy on eBay and write about in their magazine.  If you read format, can they still get stuff off it?  I mean, I think the real, you know, those like forensic file type geeks are the real good 
[02:43:00]  guys can get anything off it.  Like, you know, you think you're deleting all your stuff, but you're not.  You know, it's going somewhere in your machine.  It's on there forever.  I mean, I'm not, you know, I'm not a supercomputer geek, but that's really the way it is.  I mean, it's like when you get an email, like the cheating thing, and you think it's, you  know, something you don't want.  So you delete it.  And you're like, well, it's deleted.  That's great.  You know, I go into my, me personally, I work for a company.  I don't want them seeing what I have.  I go into my, I delete, then I go into my deleted file at least five times a day.  Now, I'm not up to, you know, I'm not doing anything that critical, but people think once  they hit delete, it's gone, but it's not. 
[02:43:30]  What's your deleted file?  Well, once you delete me.  I love that.  When we have people like Tony in studio, Jim is always the one with a million questions.  What's the deleted file?  And he's not doing it for the listeners, man.  You ever delete your email, and then you actually have a folder that says deleted.  And over time, maybe every week or something, it'll empty itself out, or you can empty it  out yourself.  It's just, it's like a safety, just in case you delete something, and later you don't  want to really have it deleted.  You have a little bit of time.  Oh, in your mail thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  You know, whether it's sent or deleted, all that stuff, it's worth purging every, you 
[02:44:00]  know, for some people, every five minutes.  Every minute, yeah.  Every minute that you're online.  If I was married, I would be in big trouble.  Really?  Yeah, man.  It's like you have these dirty emails or whatever.  It's like you don't want your girl finding them.  Yeah.  I'm married, and I delete quite often.  Really?  You know, I don't think there's anything to it.  I mean, I just don't want people to get, I'm not a parent, one of those paranoid freaks,  but you get one of those emails from somebody where it's just jokey and flirty and gets  misconstrued.  I mean, I have a friend who lives on the West Coast.  She sent me a few emails, and she was talking about her bikini wax. 
[02:44:30]  Uh-oh.  Just discovered it.  She thought it was the greatest thing.  Actually, I met her on my bachelor party.  She was with, like, five of her friends.  She sent this email.  I joked, sent something back about giving her a spank.  Harmless.  She's on one coast.  Harmless.  But really, if you think about it, it's harmless.  I'm never going to see the girl.  I bet your wife wouldn't think it's harmless.  By the way, I like the rehearsed speech he's giving us.  He's gone over this in his head.  No.  It's harmless.  We're not going to see each other.  West Coast.  East Coast.  No, but really, and this guy, her husband, went into her, like, she had her laptop over  one day, you know, was typing some emails, went for a run, and this guy blew 
[02:45:00]  his stack.  As well he fucking should.  But I didn't say anything.  He was pissed at me.  He was like, I'm going to investigate this.  I'm going to call his wife.  Is this case still pending?  No, it's done.  I finally said to her, have him call me.  I don't give a shit.  He can talk to my wife all day long.  Yeah.  Did he call?  He didn't call.  I'm kind of glad he didn't, because I hear he's an extremely big guy.  But, you know, I mean, a harmless email, you know?  Yeah.  Oh, where are you, sir?  Oh, California?  You fucking asshole.  I wouldn't want my wife talking about her bikini wax with some shamoa across the country. 
[02:45:30]  Of course.  But nothing happened.  I mean, it's that simple.  So I delete and delete.  I've had enough sexual emails where I can tell you it's very rare that you have a harmless  flirt about a bikini wax and a spanking believe in a little hard-on and a little jacking  going on.  So, yeah, I'd give you a spanking thinking about a bald vagina.  Yeah, I'd spank you.  LOL.  Well, you know, just kidding around and I'm leaking clear stuff into my socks.  That's good.  If you really, you know, this is the foolproof way.  If you really think someone's cheating if it's your wife or something, there's some great 
[02:46:00]  spyware out there.  And you hear about it all the time with the serious computer geeks.  But I hired a new editor a couple months ago, and we loaded up his computer with spyware  the day before he got there.  And I could sit in my office across, you know, like this, across my office, and I could just  watch what he, every keystroke he typed all day long.  I mean, he was IMing, like, this is my new job.  It's kind of crazy.  Some of the guys are cool.  Some are dicks.  You know.  Wow.  And, but, you know, we did it because we wrote about it.  But he was, you know, you can watch.  It was better than porn.  It was better than anything I've ever had to sit there and watch what someone else was doing. 
[02:46:30]  It's funny you say that because when we got to XM, we all got laptops.  I haven't touched mine yet.  Hell no.  I'm like, there's something going on with that laptop.  Because we obviously get in a lot of, yeah, we get in a lot of trouble, obviously.  We've been fired twice from radio, and you never know when we're going to be fired again.  And I'm thinking, no way am I going to use that laptop so they have something to use against  me down the road.  You have to be in a network, by the way, for that, right?  Huh?  For his thing to work, you have to be tied into a network.  Yeah, no, I understand.  But, I mean, just imagine the stuff the XM has come up with in the last few years, so I'm 
[02:47:00]  not taking anything for granted.  What was the first thing I took when we got fired from N.E.W.?  What was the first thing I took out of the studio?  Oh, you took out of our job, yeah.  My whole computer just ripped it right out.  It's like, I'm not going to have them going through that.  No, there's so much on there.  I mean, you really have to.  And you know if it's a company computer that they've got all kinds of stuff.  No one's telling you the truth.  I mean, if I can put spyware on, you know, your computer, then the guys who actually know  what the fuck they're doing can do anything.  Would SpyBot have caught what you put on his computer? 
[02:47:30]  What's that?  SpyBot.  It's a great program, actually.  Where you load it on and it actually will go through your computer and look for all the  spyware.  That looks for, like, advertisement spyware.  I use adware.  I use SpyBot.  SpyBot, I love.  Yeah, that would work.  But, you know, most people can't figure it out.  You know, they're not going to know enough to put an anti-spyware thing on, you know,  software on their computer.  But, I mean, you can have a field day with someone.  I mean, that's what guys, you know, guys who think their wives are cheating on, that's  what they do.  They load up the family computer and see what she's been doing.  It turns out, you know, she's been looking at recipes and guys with 12-inch penises, you  know.  You know what a lot of people are doing these days, too? 
[02:48:00]  They're cruising around with their laptops and finding Wi-Fi hotspots around neighborhoods.  And if someone has an unsecured network in their house that's wireless, you can access  whatever files that they have that aren't secured.  So, you're getting passwords.  You could get all kinds of information off the guy's computer just by cruising past his  house with a laptop.  It's the same with Bluetooth phones.  Bluetooth is the same thing, yeah.  And people hijack.  You know, there's a Paris Hilton bit every week. 
[02:48:30]  Something of hers has been hijacked, you know.  But it happens to regular schmoes.  But when they do it to guys like me, they're not looking for dirty pictures.  They're going to take your, you know, your password or your mutual fund count, something  like that.  Aren't the banks pretty good with that stuff, though?  Like, I've had credit card rip-off in Brazil, which is shocking, you know, for such a healthy  country to steal.  And the credit card company is like, okay, don't worry about it.  And they gave me the money back.  They didn't charge me.  Yeah.  They're fair about it.  But there was one scam that was going around.  It was a mutual or a Washington Mutual.  And someone would send out an email page to people. 
[02:49:00]  And it would say, Washington Mutual, their typeface, their font, it looked great.  And it would say, type in this number, we've got to secure your account.  And you type in all your information, and it was someone in Russia.  And it happened to one of my editors.  I mean, he was out of, like, his ATM account for, like, a week.  PayPal was doing that, too, where they were sending, these scam artists were sending out  emails saying they were from PayPal.  And you would hit the link, and it was a PayPal page.  And it would tell you to re-enter your account information, which you would, you know, do.  And they would get it, and they'd drain your account.  They're too crafty. 
[02:49:30]  You'll never catch them, you know.  You're going to get booted at some point.  I just go to PayPal.com if I want to go to PayPal.  Right.  Well, that's the common sense thing that a lot of people don't realize.  He's friggin' stupid.  I never understand who those morons are that get taken by this.  They're constantly sending you things that say, we will never ask you for your password,  for your username.  We will never ask this.  If you get an email, don't do it.  It's as easy as that.  You never put it.  Unless you're logging on to their site, you should never put your password anywhere. 
[02:50:00]  But these idiots, oh, what, they're asking me for.  You're kidding me.  Let's go to the phones.  They have exploded.  This guy found out his wife was cheating with his landlord, I guess.  Spike, what's the story, man?  Yeah, I had a computer with my ex-wife, and then when we split up, she took the computer  with her.  She blew it up in a lighting storm a few months later, asked me if I wanted it back after  it got repaired.  So after it got repaired, I got it back, but they never blanked out the hard drive.  I went to the message archives, and I found out she was banging the landlord downstairs. 
[02:50:30]  Wow.  What'd you do?  I didn't do anything.  We were already divorced by the time.  Already split up.  Yeah, but it still has to hurt a little bit, huh?  Yeah, it was a little shocking to see that, you know, let's go get a hotel, and I can't  believe we're doing this.  This was so much fun kind of crap.  Yeah.  I told you people say that stuff.  All right, Spike.  All right, bunch of them.  Just harmless flirting.  There's a bunch of them here.  You know what I mean?  What am I going to do?  What am I going to see?  He's on the second floor. 
[02:51:00]  I'm on the first floor.  Farmless flirting.  Let's go to New Mexico.  Clint, what's up?  I bought some laptops off of eBay for my kids for Christmas one year.  One of them had the CD-ROM in there, so I thought I'm going to see what's on there.  It has got some shit getting done by a Dalmatian dog.  It's one of the most disgusting, disturbing things I've ever seen.  Oh, the kids will love it.  You better send that in to us so we can check it out.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  I've had all kinds of people ask me, email that to this dude. 
[02:51:30]  I say, I am not sending that fucker anywhere that it can be traced back to me because I'm  not sure if it's legal or not.  That ain't going to hurt.  Just a dog banging a chick.  It's all in good fun.  I don't know.  It's good for both of them.  The chick's 18, but I'm not sure if the dog's 18.  That'd be funny if the dog's only two.  That's 14 in people years.  That's illegal.  All right, Clint.  We got one more that's really funny, or could be.  Phil in Jersey.  What's up, Phil?  Hey, it's actually Bill.  Oh, Bill.  I do home installs for Dell. 
[02:52:00]  People buy a new computer.  We go and hook it up for them.  I was at a lady's house.  Handicapped lady, right?  All she can use is one arm.  And she's like, can you please take my computer?  You know, take it with you.  I'm like, all right, no problem.  I get it back to my office, turn it on.  Oh, my God.  It's a paralyzed lady, one-arm work, and there's porn everywhere.  It's freaking hilarious.  Great.  That's funny.  It took her an hour to masturbate.  She has to click, and then rubber clit, and then go back and click. 
[02:52:30]  Let's see.  This guy fell for the PayPal scam.  Sean in Massachusetts.  What's up, Sean?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm one of those fools that got nabbed by the PayPal scam.  Now, how did you fall for it?  I thought that it was legit.  I was just looking at my emails.  I saw the thing.  I'm like, oh, well, this looks like it's something that I should do.  Don't you know, though, you're not supposed to put your information in? 
[02:53:00]  They will never send you something where you would have to do that?  I wasn't thinking.  It was one of those things where you see it.  You think you're doing the right thing, and it's like after you do it, you realize, oh, crap.  You're not in the process of helping get some money out of Nigeria, are you?  No, no, no.  Another one.  I didn't fall for that one.  But, no, they got me.  They got my bank account, my credit cards, everything.  They tried to wipe me out.  Fortunately, there wasn't that much in there to begin with, so I was okay. 
[02:53:30]  All right.  Got to watch.  Yeah, definitely.  The phones are just nuts.  By the way, we should reintroduce.  We got Tony from NSYNC.  NSYNC?  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  Jesus.  NSYNC Magazine?  Jesus.  Sorry, Tony.  NSYNC Magazine.  Tony Romando, NSYNC Magazine.  America's Gadget Guide.  Jesus.  Sorry.  Featuring that shirt.  I was just looking.  Apparently, you can go to opiananthony.com and see pictures of this very shirt I'm wearing  today.  Does it look blue online?  I don't know if they've done something to the color. 
[02:54:00]  It looks a little more periwinkle online than it does to me live.  No, it looks blue.  It's blue, seafoam green, and peach.  Yeah, whatever.  And now anybody can look and see that that is blue.  Let's go to Todd in Kansas City.  Todd?  Yo.  Hey.  What's up, you guys?  I love your show, man.  I just want to say, when I got away my old computer, I did exactly what you did.  Took out the motherboard and everything and smashed it.  Yeah, you got it.  Oh, that's all.  Okay.  Yeah, you got to.  And also, I got those emails from PayPal saying, do that? 
[02:54:30]  All I do is delete them.  You're a smart fella.  I'll say.  Very practical of you, sir.  All right.  This guy does PC cleanups all the time.  Fernando, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  Hey, I got a fixed computers here, and I get computers every time.  I got lucky a couple of times.  I got this chick to take pictures for his boyfriends and everything.  And, you know, you find their pictures, like, you know, showing the snatch and all that  stuff.  But the last week, I got, like, this dude that I was blowing himself sending pictures to 
[02:55:00]  his boyfriend.  And it was this gay dude.  Ah, that was the most disgusting thing I ever seen, man.  The guy was, like, picturing himself with his webcam or something.  And the guy was blowing himself.  And, ah, anyway, so just, ugh.  Dude, your job is like a gynecologist.  You got to take the good with the bad.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Pretty much.  But, I mean, you cannot imagine how many things you see.  But, I mean, in case you're interested, sometimes you can just get a program that you can just, 
[02:55:30]  you can just, if you get a hard drive for somebody, you can just, if somebody formats  the hardware, you can just stop.  You're from India.  I know, my accent's horrible.  Are you from India?  No, I'm Colombia, actually.  Oh, really?  Colombia.  All right.  That's funny.  I know.  He just, as an instinct, when he leaves the house, he puts the hard drive in his ass.  But, excuse me, you can just stop there.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Go for Pedro.  Yeah.  Tony, people are loving you on the show today. 
[02:56:00]  The phones have exploded.  Thanks for having us on.  What else you got in Sync Magazine?  I see an iPod for underwater use.  Just in case you want to take it into the shower.  Is that it?  I think it's for the snorkeling scuba type.  Yeah.  It probably gets a little lonely down there.  Yes.  We got some of the best new phones.  Yeah.  What's up with the new phones?  Because my phone's a piece of crap.  And you never know when to buy a new phone.  Because I bought this thing.  And then, like, two weeks later, the phone's exploded.  It had all this new stuff. 
[02:56:30]  And I'm like, oh, why didn't I just wait two weeks?  You know what?  You can't.  You'll never be able to.  Right.  If you're looking for it, it's on 114.  But, you know, the trick is just pick the phone that's right for you.  Are you looking to take video?  Are you looking to take pictures?  Do you just want one with long battery life?  Or, you know, do you want cheap?  So, what we do at Sync is kind of break it down.  We do by style.  If you just want to take pictures, which one you want to download, which ones are cheap.  You know what?  I just want to be able to take a phone call.  Then you should get.  I just want to take a phone call where my service doesn't crap out.  That's all I want.  Pick up an old StarTek.  I don't need a phone that takes pictures because they don't have that figured out yet. 
[02:57:00]  We're getting there because now they have the flashes and stuff.  Camera phones take some of the worst pictures I've ever seen.  They still take bad pictures.  You know what the funny thing is, people are re-formatting those old StarTeks because  you could drop them from like two stories.  They wouldn't break the clarity.  I had a StarTek.  I loved it.  They're going back to them.  Old school.  Some people just want to load up everything they possibly can on it.  But I use a Trio 650.  It's a geek phone.  Yeah.  I'm not a tech guy.  I'm from FHM and Rolling Stone. 
[02:57:30]  Tech is not my specialty, but I use this thing.  I can get emails.  My guys will go on a photo shoot.  They'll send me pictures onto my phone.  I can see it.  So, for me, it's practical.  We all got Trio's when we walked in the door here at XM as well.  You don't use it.  And I love it for all the stuff you just said, but I got to tell you, man, as far as a phone,  it stinks.  Unless the newer Trio is better.  I don't know.  The 650 is fantastic.  You probably had a 600.  The camera was crap in the 600.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But the other stuff is amazing.  I mean, I'd be on a train or something and I'd have to Google directions or whatever. 
[02:58:00]  Just quick internet access for simple stuff.  The picture thing, like you said.  The new one is great.  Downloading articles about us.  But there are two phones in here.  We're talking about bad pictures.  But, I mean, they're getting up there now, like two megapixel phones.  And they could make five.  You guarantee they can do it.  They're just making us all buy the two first.  Absolutely.  Dump the warehouses.  Yeah.  They're going to run you through the ringer.  So, you know, phones are always a hot thing.  Every month we do a thing called Sexy Six.  We take the six sexiest gadgets and we usually do something kind of dirty.  This year, it was our one-year anniversary, so we silkscreened the gadgets on the cake. 
[02:58:30]  And then two hot models came in and smeared it all over each other.  That was worth the printed paper alone.  Of course.  You know, we got some celebs.  We did Kevin Dillon.  We did the guy from the Fantastic Four.  Where's Kevin Dillon?  I love him.  You see a fucking head come apart like that.  Yeah.  You see a fucking cake come apart.  Page 98 for him.  Except maybe the Indy 500.  Yeah.  Nothing better than a good piece of pussy except maybe the Indy 500.  Pussy.  Yeah.  That was a classic.  He's actually, he's exactly the way he is on Entourage, it turns out.  Yeah.  Super cool guy.  You know, most celebs are buttholes, but this guy was great. 
[02:59:00]  Tony, the other thing can sink magazine.  Ten tricks for winning poker online every time.  Oh!  I'm talking to Anthony here who loves the online poker.  He's playing all the time.  He's a junkie.  Love it.  Total junkie.  Yeah, he's into it.  A lot of our listeners are doing the online poker these days.  Yep.  You know, it's huge.  We did another story on it.  I thought it was interesting really quick, and I never thought this, but a lot of people  like playing the online poker, and I guess it's obvious now that I read it, but you say  in your magazine always hit the table, excuse me, always hit the tables on Friday nights. 
[02:59:30]  Yep.  Because people are coming home from happy hour or whatever, or out in the bar and thinking,  ah, I can win some money right now.  Absolutely.  That's what I said.  I said the same thing.  I go in there drunk on the nights when they're, you know, you'd have more drunk people playing.  You win a lot more.  People take more chances.  It's payday, so they're feeling, you know, every other week, you know, they're getting  paid.  Yeah.  They're feeling really rich.  If you walk on there on a Friday night with a bunch of drunk people and put your screen  name on as if you were a chick, you'll clean house.  That's another thing.  They'll think you're some dumb broad, and you can really rack it up.  I mean, we got these tips from real pros, and, you know, whether, you know, if you know 
[03:00:00]  what you're doing or not, if you follow these 10 tips, you won't get cleaned out, you know,  but I think the big problem for people is they never fold.  You know, they just keep riding out their hand.  Oh, fold?  I fold 90% of my hands.  You got it.  Boring as shit.  Don't worry.  You just go click.  You got to do something else while you're playing if you can, you know, do two things  at once.  So usually, if I'm laying in bed, watch a little TV, got the computer on, yeah, boink, boink,  fold, fold.  Oh, that's a good hand.  I'll play that one.  And then you concentrate on the game.  The more people I talk to about this online poker that are successful, they say exactly 
[03:00:30]  that, Anthony.  You got to fold a lot.  You're folding a lot.  These idiots that just stay in the hand.  It's like they fall in love with these bad hands.  I mean, online poker, I think, is a little different.  You're doing your Thursday night game with your buddies, drinking beer.  You know, the guy who folds all, you know, when you're playing for nickels, that pisses  off a crew.  But this is, you know.  Well, that's it, too.  If you're playing for nickels, you're not going to fold a hand that might end up being  something.  Right.  You're not going to chase a straight down if you're, you know, you got to put a hundred 
[03:01:00]  bucks up for the next bet.  You're going to fold it and go all the way for the next hand.  If it's going to cost you a nickel to see the river card and see if you made your straight,  then you're going to stay in the hand.  Do you win a lot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do pretty good.  You're still up in.  Yeah.  No, I'm still.  We haven't asked him in a while.  I mean, he was up like $1,200 or something.  I depended like $250 in the account when I started.  And I've been playing with that.  I go up to, I've never cracked $1,500, but I've gone up to $1,400 down to where I had 
[03:01:30]  like $45 left.  And you got to hit the $10 rooms so you could build up enough to play a $50 hand.  It's an awesome invention.  I mean, if you're not, you know, if you're not, you know, losing.  It's gambling at home.  It's great.  I mean, if you're not losing the baby's, you know, milk money, you're great.  I mean, it's ours entertainment.  Better than porn.  No, I don't even know if you would know the real answer to this, but do you think there's  like cheat codes and all that crap as far as online poker go?  We talked about it before, and they swear that they're valid.  I mean, granted, they're in Costa Rica or on some island.  You're never going to know. 
[03:02:00]  But, I mean, if he's up to $1,500 down, I mean, they can't clean everyone out.  It's kind of like, you know, playing the slot machines.  You've got to allow some people to win or the thing would go away.  I mean, I do think there's people out there who can tap in.  You know, there's, you know, super geeks, computer geeks who can probably tap in and see what  everyone's doing or what everyone has.  But that guy can figure out better ways to take money.  I mean, when you're playing for a $40 hand, it's not going to, you know, they're not going to make enough off you.  I think that some of the personalities are just computer generated, and they're going to win anyway.  I think if you're six people, two of you are actually part of the company.  You know, and I'm Frank from Delaware, so he'll win, and this one will win. 
[03:02:30]  That one, you're never going to know because you're never facing each other.  So I think the computer company will win.  Yeah, that's why I'm suspicious.  But you've got to let people win or, like I said, the thing wouldn't be as popular.  I mean, it's entertainment.  That's popular.  And beware of the flirting girl.  Yep.  Because it could be one of us.  Anna's a girl, and it's not.  You know, you get some drunk guy.  It's just like a chat room.  You know, you're such a great hand.  Right, right.  You know, where are you from?  Let's hook up.  And it's just some fat dude from Long Island.  You won't take her as seriously as you would take a male player. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, right.  And, yeah, if she's talking to you, maybe you're not going to really push her hard to put her money all in.  Things like that.  Yeah, I've seen it happen.  It's not those people.  I don't.  Everyone at the table is a guy.  I don't look at the icons sitting there and go, well, I must be a nice blonde sitting there.  Absolutely.  No, it's Bob.  Yeah, whoever it is is not one of those TV poker, the hot chick TV poker players.  No.  You know, it's some slob or some fat chick who doesn't know how to play.  This guy is freaking out.  Let's go to Frank in Pennsylvania.  Frank, go ahead.  Yeah, I'm just a little weird about these online pokers. 
[03:03:30]  They're still based in the Caribbean.  It's illegal in the United States.  What happens when you go to cash out?  Do you get your money or what?  Yeah, people have gotten their money.  I've heard from...  I've never heard anybody say that they were fucked with the online poker because they tried to get their money and it was hell.  These guys...  Why would they blow something?  They are making so much money running a legitimate poker site.  Why are they going to blow it and ruin their credibility and have everyone pull out by trying to screw people over for a few bucks? 
[03:04:00]  They are raking in money.  There are thousands upon thousands of people playing that they're getting a cut of the pots that are being raked and the entry fee.  You know, you go into the $10 room, it costs you $11.  Where do you think that dollar goes?  You go into the $20 room, it's $2.  The $50 room, it's a $5 entry fee that you've got to pay up to the house.  They're making a lot of money.  Never use the auto button. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, that kind of tips people off as to what you have.  If you're waiting for your turn to bet to come around and you hit, you know, bet automatically, you know, bet the big blind.  If all of a sudden the bet comes around to you and click goes right to the next guy, people know you got something, you're betting, you wait, you know.  I've done that.  I've had really good hands and I've just stalled and delayed and wait and wait and wait like I'm really thinking it over.  I mean, you watch those guys on TV, you know, and they drive you crazy because the kid's flipping his chips, he's picking his nose. 
[03:05:00]  He knows what he's doing right away.  And he's hooking the guy.  It's the same online.  It shouldn't be any different.  Yep.  That's how it works.  Very good.  Let's go to the phones again.  Jason in Texas.  Jason.  Actually, this is James.  Sorry.  There's someone in here today over there.  All right, James.  I was going to call about these bogus emails, man.  I got one a few weeks back that used the FBI typeface, even the FBI logo at the top. 
[03:05:30]  And, of course, the email, it said that a complaint had been logged against me with the Internet Security Commission or something.  And it really started freaking me out.  I started thinking, what the hell have I sent people?  Well, the way I caught it was at the bottom there was a misspelled word.  But I went ahead and followed the link, man, and there was a whole fucking page from name, address, email accounts, to social security number, driver's license.  I mean, it was really well put together.  If I hadn't have seen the misspelled word, I would have been, you know, I wouldn't have filled it out. 
[03:06:00]  What was the word?  I don't remember.  It was like Believe or something.  They had got two letters mixed up.  Yeah, they could never quite type those guys.  If they hadn't have misspelled, man, I think they could have really taken some evil.  But what was funny, I don't know if anything ever happened, but I just forwarded the email to the real FBI.  Yeah.  All right.  Jeff Sampson from North Carolina said he downloaded the photos of my shirt. 
[03:06:30]  And ran them through a web color analyzer.  The closest named colors to this are either cornflower blue or aqua, both of which are pretty gay.  That's what he said.  Thank you, Jeff.  I'll accept cornflower blue.  Cornflower blue.  That is funny.  Well, the picture's up.  No worries, though.  Ant will never wear the shirt again.  Not because he's embarrassed.  He doesn't wear anything twice.  This Nigerian scam, Bambino in Cleveland. 
[03:07:00]  Go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Talking about the 419 Nigerian fraud thing, there's actually a guy who has a website where he engages in conversations with these guys.  Yeah, read it.  He calls himself David Lee Roth and sends pictures of David Lee Roth and tells them that he'll meet them in Nigeria to hand over the money personally and stuff.  It's pretty funny.  He actually, yeah, carries on an email conversation with these people.  And then he says, you know, hey, I'm a little leery about this.  People have been telling me things that maybe it's not legit. 
[03:07:30]  I really need pictures of you.  Oh, yeah.  And they sent a picture that was actually a scanned picture from a newspaper of some black guy.  And he's like, okay, well, thank you for sending your picture.  I'm ready to send the information I need.  Here's my picture.  Yeah, and it's like David Lee Roth.  And the guy's just jerking around and made a whole site.  I just sent a messenger for you guys.  And he also documents other people who have taken up the fight as well at the bottom of his page.  I've replied to the guys a few times where I've carried on and gone back and forth like five times before I just send a racial epithet-laden email back. 
[03:08:00]  I want to talk to one person that has fallen for this stupid Nigerian.  And there are people.  Obviously.  I read one from some.  It was a guy whose father was taken by this whole thing of, like, everything.  And it was how he actually went to Nigeria.  The father ended up going to Nigeria and trying to get his money back and got into some big trouble, almost got killed. 
[03:08:30]  I'm going to punch that before I see some.  He's lost everything.  Did he get his money back?  No, of course not.  If my father actually did that, I would go to his house.  If it was at the end of Cuckoo's Nest, I'd put a pillow on his face and I'd murder him.  You dope, dumb motherfucker.  Yeah, I don't know how they fall for those things.  Anything that's happening out of the ordinary of your daily existence, you have to look at like it's something.  Remember the ride-along I went on with Keith the Cop?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I went on a ride-along. 
[03:09:00]  We pull up to this house.  They get a call for a scam.  An old woman was taken.  Turns out two women came to her door and said that they were selling this material.  What they did was they found out who the neighbor next door was and said, oh, Margaret from next door, we just showed her.  She loves this material that we're selling and thought you would love this.  Now, meanwhile, it's a great scam because you're thinking, the old lady's thinking, I can't send her away or Margaret's going to be pissed. 
[03:09:30]  She went through the trouble of sending them over to my house.  So she invites him in.  What this woman would do is take this big bolt of material and open it up in front of the woman as she's hiding her friend.  Her friend is now ransacking the house, going through her purse, her bedroom, and she's like, look at this beautiful material, like holding up a sheet.  Don't look behind this.  And rip this woman off.  Anytime anything out of the ordinary happens to you in your daily existence, look twice at it.  It's probably nothing. 
[03:10:00]  But you have to be on the guard like that.  And I call it paranoia, but I'm not fucking getting taken.  Life is never that easy where someone's just going to hand you something that easy.  No.  Brad in Cleveland, he has a million dollars U.S.  Right.  It always sounds like, well, your cut would be 12 million U.S. dollars.  Oh, the U.S. dollar.  Got to get on that.  Let's go to Brad in Cleveland.  Brad.  Hey, bodies.  How you doing?  All right.  I engage in conversation with these guys from Nigeria for about two weeks, 
[03:10:30]  and I pretend I'm like an 80-year-old Japanese guy that speaks very good English.  And, you know, I don't put any L's.  I always replace them with the R's.  In the emails?  Even typing?  That's kind of funny.  And I talk very, very, you know, bad English in there.  And at the end of the two weeks or whatever, because I keep like three or four of these going,  and I send them the picture from tubgirl.com.  Tubgirl?  The girl is shitting on herself.  That is one of the grossest pictures ever. 
[03:11:00]  One time I got a response from the guy, and he goes,  you know God sees you with these pictures.  And I'm thinking, you fucking asshole.  God sees you.  Now, wait a minute.  The guy who tried to go to Nigeria, are they actually from Nigeria?  Oh, God damn it.  You've never seen tubgirl.com?  Oh, another good one.  That is one of the most classic pictures.  Yeah, have you never seen tubgirl?  It's hot.  That's right up there with the horse gag video and everything else.  Oh, my God.  You've never seen tubgirl? 
[03:11:30]  That is so heinous.  That's like, that's, I don't know.  Jimmy would like lemonparty.org probably.  Lemonparty.org?  That's a good one.  That is a fountain of liquid crap arcing up out of her ass  and flying back direct hit into her face.  And they pixelate out her vag.  Like, that's the problem.  That's what they got to do over there.  Japanese, Japan.  They got to pixelate out the vag.  The pubic hair, I think. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, the pubic hair, because some kind of, what's the problem with pubic hair?  I hope to know.  Very dishonorable.  You can do shit in the face, but don't show a pubic hair.  Who's this guy that went to Nigeria?  Were the people really in Nigeria that sent this?  Like, I want to know about this guy.  Yeah.  They're Nigerian.  They're from Nigeria.  That's like the scam capital of the world is Nigeria.  All kinds of scams come out of Nigeria for some reason.  So why would you go there?  How would you meet them?  Does anybody know any more about this?  They set up flights. 
[03:12:30]  They set up to meet you at hotels and get your, sometimes they hold you hostage.  I've heard those stories.  I don't know how true they are, especially with Americans.  I know, like, Russians, things like that.  And you don't know how much to believe.  But, yeah, it's like a big scam capital.  And it's this dream of all this money that they're offering you from this, you know, business deal.  And the government's trying to take the money from them, so they've got to get it out of the country quickly.  And could we please deposit it in your account?  And we will give you 10%, which amounts to $25 million, if you just let us use your bank account. 
[03:13:00]  And some of them are, they take your bank account.  But other ones are, we don't even need your bank account.  Just send us money because we need funds in order to make this transaction.  We're looking.  We have to bribe certain officials to get this over.  So, please send us some cash.  And then they'll always, it'll always be, we're almost there.  I hate to do this, but we just need another, like, $5,000.  The money is almost there. 
[03:13:30]  And they send you, like, documentation of checks and, you know, business partners and actual letters from lawyers, things like that, to really get you going.  Anyone that would fall for this, you should be executed.  Yeah, you deserve to be wiped out.  Wiped out.  All right, let's go to Keith the Cop, who was on that ride along with Anthony.  Keith.  Hey, Keith.  Good morning, gentlemen.  How you been, officer?  I'm doing well.  Sergeant.  Yeah, that was one of those scams, the one that Anthony was talking about.  Another big one, and they do this all over the city, is where you're walking down the street and one person will say, oh, you know, you dropped something. 
[03:14:00]  And, well, they really have something that you dropped, not like Jimmy does.  But, and they'll come up and they'll go, and you'll say, oh, that's not mine.  And then they'll have a third person step up and go, well, what's in it?  Like a bag or something.  And they'll open it up and they'll have, like, a huge wad of cash.  And it'll be, let's say, $50,000.  And they'll say, oh, we should split this.  And they get, and they go, well, we can't just split it because it could be, you know, stolen from a bank. 
[03:14:30]  So I have a friend that's going to wash the money.  So what they'll tell the person is, you give us $5,000 out of your bank account, and then I'll go into my friend in the bank, and he'll wash this, and we'll give you $25,000.  Ah.  And these morons go to the bank and give these people $5,000.  And they get nothing.  To the point where one time the girl couldn't get the money out of the bank.  We have, my partner, I happen to see the scam happen on the street. 
[03:15:00]  Girl goes with them to the bank, gives them $1,000.  They go back to her apartment.  They go get something to eat.  They go to the movies.  They come back.  And we sat there the whole time.  They were going to spend the whole night in this girl's house because this chick really thought she was getting $25,000.  And we end up going to the house, and there's these two girls sitting on the couch eating McDonald's.  And we went into the bag, and it was $100,000 on one side, $100,000 on the other side.  And it was just all newspaper in the middle.  Wow.  But, you know, and we closed out like 80 cases. 
[03:15:30]  So, I mean, you think about how many people are just suckers for that shit.  It's like, you know, amazing.  Do you hear about this one scam?  It's really awful.  It's when a girl gets in your car, and you pay her money for oral sex, and it turns out that it's not a girl.  Have you heard that one?  You know what?  I have heard that one.  Yeah, it's pretty awful to fall for that five or six times.  And, I mean, being that you used to live towards the Midtown area, have I ever had the one where they tell you,  oh, yeah, just give me $100, and she's up on the fourth floor.  Have you gone upstairs for that one?  Actually, no.  What is that?  That was, you know, like. 
[03:16:00]  I almost had that, by the way, where the guy tried to rob me going for an escort probably about six months ago, not even.  Yeah, they do, like, a lot of the tours and stuff like that.  They'll hang out by the peep shows, and they'll have pictures of hot chicks and, you know, like, pimp-looking guys.  They'll go up and say, listen, you know, give me $100.  She's in this hotel room on the fourth floor.  And, you know, guys are drunk or whatever.  They give the guy $100.  They go up to the fourth floor.  There's not even a room there, you know.  I had one guy.  I was going for this girl a few months ago, and there's a guy who was bugging her, but he's outside her door. 
[03:16:30]  And he's like, well, I'm with her.  You've got to pay me.  And I was like, eh.  It didn't seem right, because I'm like, you never know.  Some of these whores are paranoid.  And then I called her, and he's like, oh, it's just going to ring on my cell phone once you call.  He was so good that I was like, maybe he's, I knew it was bullshit, so I left.  And I called her from downstairs.  She's like, he's not with me.  Yeah, that's the same thing.  They do that, too.  I wish you were there.  I would have, you could have helped me.  We had a limo driver once years ago when I was playing in a band, and we were playing in the city. 
[03:17:00]  So we all got a limo and came in and played the gig.  We're walking back out, and some black guy comes up with this box with a picture of, like, camcorder on it.  And he's like, yo, dude, I just got this.  It's hot.  A hundred bucks.  And it's yours.  And the limo driver's like, whoa, a hundred bucks.  I'll take it.  I'll take it.  Like, people are clamoring over this thing.  And he gives the guy a hundred bucks and takes it. 
[03:17:30]  Takes the box.  Of course, the black guy just runs off.  And this box was wrapped in really heavy, thick shrink wrap that you couldn't really cut through.  You needed some kind of knife or scissors.  And then we noticed the pictures of the camcorders that are on the box were cut out from a flyer from The Wiz.  And they were just placed on the box to make it look like a camcorder and wrapped real thick shrink wrap so you couldn't open it right there. 
[03:18:00]  And you fell for it.  Inside was a brick.  It was a brick and some newspaper.  That's probably not working on a box, man.  I don't think so.  Oh, we lost Keith.  Okay.  Some guy just sent me every nude picture of Phoebe Cates from a movie.  From movies.  Every single one.  I want to thank you for that.  Yeah.  Come in and say hi to us.  Let's say hi to Mark.  Mark, what's up?  Clutch Clutch.  Thank you.  Hey, fellas.  I think about five minutes ago, Opie or Anthony said that they'll never get taken. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  I've got words for you.  The Citadel.  Citadel stock.  That's CDL stock.  I knew it was too good to be true.  Yeah, you're right.

We'll continue in just a bit.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the breasts. 
[03:20:30]  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  It's a hard piece of air.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  In case you didn't know.  Give me fuel.  Give me fire.  Give me double.  Shut it up. 
[03:21:00]  We have confirmation.  Confirmation.  This just in.  Off the AP wire.  Can't do that sound, but Anthony is indeed wearing a periwinkle shirt.  Yes, it is periwinkle.  My girlfriend just emailed me and said, yes, it is periwinkle.  So, right from the source. 
[03:21:30]  You know, after that last guy, though, saying that it could be.  I'm wearing a periwinkle shirt.  You certainly are.  Take it off.  You got a T-shirt underneath you.  No, that's nice.  Leave it out.  It looks good on you.  Periwinkle.  Yeah.  You know, but I think that, I think you, I think it, I think it's better than what  the last listener came up with.  Corn blue?  Corn flower blue?  Corn flake blue or corn?  Corn flake blue.  Corn flower blue?  He needed the money.  I liked it on you.  It actually brings out the load in your eye.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:22:00]  You clever fuck.  Damn it.  Rob?  Periwinkle.  What's going on?  Periwinkle.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Rob Dibble.  Rob!  Right off the bat, I mean, we talked to Rob from time to time.  I want to apologize, Rob, but you're talking to Anthony today, and he's wearing a periwinkle  collared shirt with, uh...  Seafoam greens?  No, lime green and pink stripes.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I'm not even going to argue the color anymore. 
[03:22:30]  And I got to tell you, if he was on the golf course, he would almost get away with it,  but he's trying to do a shock jock radio show.  I'm a shock jock in periwinkle.  Yeah, you really look shocking.  Oh, well.  Yes, even Rob is disgusted.  He barely knows us.  Ugh.  Why?  Hey, a lot going on in baseball there, Rob.  Yeah.  I am so...  Not even halfway through the season, and it's been nothing but drama the entire year.  Drama!  What I love is that my Mets are just, they keep just trucking along. 
[03:23:00]  What a likable team the Mets are this year.  Pedro with another big win last night, 12 strikeouts, and all the talk here in New York  is that Joe Torrey's going to be fired any day.  Two-hitter, no-hitter up to, what, the 7th?  Yeah, something like that.  Damn.  Pedro, what is he, 7-1 now?  7-1.  What an addition.  He's outstanding.  He's worth the price of admission.  There is somebody that was paid good money to come to a team and is actually performing 
[03:23:30]  above what they expected.  That's fantastic.  Now...  And on the other side of the town, those guys were paid an awful lot of money and aren't  producing.  The New York Yankees.  You know, proving that the manager's just a waste of time.  Because now all of a sudden...  I doubt that Joe Torrey would get fired, but if they do, it'd be just another ridiculous  step in their history.  I mean, here's a guy who brings you four world championships in five years back in the  90s.  And going into 2,000. 
[03:24:00]  And their pitching sucks.  And it's a question of, you bring in guys that Carl Pavano was a below 500 pitcher.  Jarrett Wright had won six games over seven years before.  He won 15 with the Braves last year.  And you pay him over $20 million.  I mean, what are you thinking?  Well, Brian Cashman should be just shot.  Why do you let guys like Nick Johnson go, who's this great young first baseman?  They're getting rid of all the young talent. 
[03:24:30]  And they're bringing in these old pitchers.  The same shit they did in the 80s.  And it seems like when George was out of baseball and Gene Michael was running the team,  that's when they allowed Rivera and Pettit and Bernie and all these guys to develop.  Well, I'll tell you.  You know, Nick Johnson, this is his first year he's ever really done anything.  But he was always hurt with the Yankees, always had the risk problems, always on the disabled list.  He was on the disabled list in the minor leagues.  Not many guys go on the disabled list in the minor leagues.  So, you know, that I could see when they traded him up to Montreal.  I like it.  I had no problem with that. 
[03:25:00]  But it's some of the other things that they've done.  I mean, did you need Alex Rodriguez?  I don't think the Yankees needed him.  I love what Alfonso Soriano does for you, especially up the middle.  And the Yankees have not had a good second baseman since Soriano left.  Do you think he was a good second?  And I'm a big believer in the young talent.  But I always felt it was kind of like a bat for a bat.  And you argue he would have taken one of the best players in baseball.  Soriano was really never a great fielder.  I mean, I think he was like an average fielder at best.  Yes, but the thing that Soriano brings you, he brings you some speed. 
[03:25:30]  He brings you that young enthusiasm, you know, trying to make it work.  And then I think the worst thing that the Yankees did was let Miguel Cairo go.  You know, Cairo was a great second baseman last year.  He played well in the field, and he's one of those grinders.  And the thing, you know, the show that I do with Kevin Kennan every day,  and Kevin's managed in the major leagues with Texas and Boston, he's won.  And we talked to David Eckstein yesterday.  You don't win without David Eckstein on your team.  You need the little grinders.  You need the little hustlers. 
[03:26:00]  You need guys like that.  The Yankees don't have any of that.  They have a bunch of huge all-star guys on their team,  but they don't have one guy that can grind it out on a daily basis.  And I think that motivates the big guys.  When you see a guy, I mean, Barry Bonds referenced Eckstein years ago  when they were in the World Series against each other and said,  this is my favorite player in the major leagues.  When Barry Bonds says that David Eckstein is his favorite player in the major leagues,  what does that tell you?  That a guy who's 5'7", 165 pounds and grinds it out every day 
[03:26:30]  could barely reach first base in the air from shortstop.  That's the type of player that guys can't believe are playing in the major leagues  and are successful.  And if you look at Eckstein on the St. Louis Cardinals,  he's way better than Edgar Renneria with the Red Sox.  So Antonio LaRusso loves having that guy.  So that's the thing I think the Yankees are missing in that clubhouse.  They don't have a guy that breaks up the monotony like a David Wells.  They don't have a little grinder that goes out there and plays his ass off every night. 
[03:27:00]  And, you know, yeah, Sheffield's great.  A-Rod's great.  Jeter's great.  You know, those guys are great all-star players,  but where's the nice little grinder that's going to dive to first base  to try to beat out an infield player?  Yeah, you need that ugly player.  I mean, these guys are all pretty boys, and they're too busy getting pussy.  Well, you know, you've got guys getting therapy.  They can't handle all this tail in New York City.  You walk around, especially this time of year, it's ridiculous out there.  Mike Mussina's never won anything.  He's making $19 million a year. 
[03:27:30]  Why do I need Mike Mussina on my team?  That whole front office, their baseball decision-making has stunk.  Everything they did.  And, look, Showalter, to me, was a typical over-manager when he was with the Yankees.  You know, lefty-lefty.  Wade Boggs wouldn't face a lefty all year until he faced Randy Johnson in the playoffs.  So he'd always play like, you know, Randy Velarde at third when there was a lefty pitching.  So he over-managed, but he was great with young talent, and he had a great eye for young talent.  And to me, they completely lack that now, and they stink. 
[03:28:00]  And Giambi is a bum, and he never won anything when he was with Oakland.  Oh, yeah.  And then you look at Brad Halsey that they traded to get Randy Johnson, a guy who's at the end of his career.  And I don't think he's really even motivated to be pitching in New York, to tell you the truth.  I think he's just kind of got it on cruise control.  And, you know, Halsey's going to tear it up for many years.  Right.  You can't give away all your young talent, because then teams are like, go ahead, throw those 40-year-olds out there.  I don't think there's anybody that intimidates other players anymore on that Yankees pitching staff. 
[03:28:30]  Well, the Yankees are heading into some lean years now.  In the New York papers, Steinbrenner, because you said you don't think Torrey's going to get fired,  but Steinbrenner in the papers today hinting that he's looking for someone maybe more like Billy Martin.  Yeah.  That came up today.  Oh, well, geez.  Poor Billy Martin's dead.  Right, right.  Poor Billy Martin's dead.  But someone that is, I guess all of a sudden, George Steinbrenner doesn't like Joe Torrey's laid-back style.  He's an ass.  Steinbrenner's an ass.  Well, the thing about Joe Torrey is he's always kept those guys' egos out of the clubhouse. 
[03:29:00]  And I think, you know what, maybe it's time to let some of them come back in.  Maybe it's time, you know, Giambi needs to just blow up and explode on people.  I mean, I'm very good friends with him.  He's a great guy, but he's been Mr. Nice Guy since he's been in New York.  Thank God I didn't say what I was about to say.  Let these guys run rampant.  Let them wear beards.  Let them grow their hair long.  Let them do whatever they want to do so they don't need to go to therapy.  Very good.  Well, you know, it's funny, man.  A buddy of mine and I were discussing baseball, and he was saying that one of the major problems is, like, with free agency, 
[03:29:30]  a whole loyalty factor is going to be tested because when somebody's a free agent, it's automatically different because of, you know, like, the timing and stuff.  Yeah, that's true to some extent, but it wouldn't matter whatever team I played on or whatever team some guy came from and came onto my team.  I mean, once you get those 25 guys to leave spring training, they're my boys.  That's my family.  And you're loyal to the name on the front.  You don't worry about the name on the back.  And there's so much money being thrown around out there.  I mean, it's hard not to be motivated. 
[03:30:00]  And people say, well, how can the Yankees be getting beat?  Because they are the Yankees.  Everybody hates the Yankees.  Everybody knows their payroll.  Everybody knows that they're one of the best franchises in the history of sport.  So when they come to your town, you want to beat the crap out of them.  Yeah, you're ready for them when they hit.  There's not enough guys that were brought up through the Yankees organization that understand that, that have to defend, you know, the name on the front of that jersey.  Okay, they walk in the Yankee club, I'll say, I'm a Yankee.  But are you really a Yankee? 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, I mean, you're playing 162 games a year.  There's some games you're going to slack a little bit, maybe go out for a happy hour the night before, a couple beers.  But Yankees come to town, you're getting to bed early and taking your vitamins.  Exactly.  Hey, you mentioned Barry Bonds in there.  What's up with Bonds?  I was reading a couple things about him over the weekend.  And pretty much no one can get in touch with him or he's really not keeping in touch with the team that much.  No, the only way they can get in touch with him is on his website.  And, you know, I talked about this probably about a month ago.  Is that that's a problem for the team. 
[03:31:00]  That if they don't have control of Barry Bonds and they've, you know, given him so much latitude to go out there and do whatever he wants.  He's back with Greg Anderson, his personal trainer that's, you know, under federal indictment for all the steroid and all the other accusations.  I mean, you know, even Major League Baseball said, hey, you don't need to be hanging around with that guy.  Barry's doing whatever Barry wants to do.  But I still don't see this guy playing more than a month to two months this year if he wants to play.  I think what he's doing is he's hiding.  He's got an alleged girlfriend writing a book about him. 
[03:31:30]  You know, he could still be prosecuted for perjury if they figure out that he lied to the grand jury.  If this girl comes out and, you know, corroborates her story and says, listen, he, you know, told me he used steroids and he said all this other stuff.  You know, he could be in big trouble.  So I think he's just laying low.  Do you think he's...  He doesn't need to come back until next year if he's 100%.  You think he's going to be able to, you know, set the home run record at this point?  I definitely think he can set the home run record.  I mean, he's running out of years, though.  I think that's the biggest issue in his life. 
[03:32:00]  I think keeping his marriage intact and staying out of jail right now is a bigger, you know, thing.  Plus he's got tax evasion charges that are probably going to come up against him.  You know, when it's all said and done, it's more important to hit 756 homers.  Yes.  Than be married.  Yeah.  That's what they're going to remember you for.  Mariano Rivera, obviously.  I'm a Yankee fan.  Not the same effect he used to have.  I think a lot of it's age.  People catch up to you.  But also, I feel like he was kind of overused in the last couple of years. 
[03:32:30]  And I love Joe Torre.  I just disagreed the way he would always bring him in the eighth inning with one out.  And I think because their middle relief kind of blew for the last couple of years,  that kind of shortened Rivera's effectiveness as far as their career goes.  Yeah, and he didn't throw this offseason also.  So it was kind of an experiment that he was trying on his own.  I don't even know if the Yankees knew that he wasn't going to work out this offseason and throw.  So he came to spring training not having picked up a ball since last year.  Oh, wow.  Let's just all acknowledge.  I've never heard of that.  But, you know, for Mariano, how can you argue with the results he's had in his career? 
[03:33:00]  So if he thought it would work, then more power to him.  Let's all just acknowledge the Yankees stink this year.  I'm a Yankee fan.  And I couldn't be happier.  I could not be happier.  The Rocket, is he coming to the Yankees?  I hope he doesn't come to the Yankees.  I would love to see him go to the Baltimore Orioles.  You think he's definitely going to move on?  I think so because, you know what, you could rent Roger Clemens for a couple of months  and then he could go back to the Houston Astros at the end of this year.  And everything would be rosy. 
[03:33:30]  I still think, though, you might see him in a Texas uniform because Hicks and the owner of the Houston Astros are best buddies.  You think he's going to pitch next year?  Oh, yeah.  I definitely think he's going to pitch next year.  What is he going to be?  Because, you know, he may not win that many games with the Astros, here's a guy who can win 350 career games.  And so now you have your seven-side youngs, your two world championships.  You don't need anything more as far as that stuff goes.  But as far as for all time, you would love to be remembered as one of the winningest pitchers of all time. 
[03:34:00]  So I think now, you know, hey, at this point he's 42 years old.  He's still one of the best pitchers in baseball.  Why not play one more year?  I've been following his stats this year.  It's amazing.  The guy should be undefeated.  He should be like 8-0.  I mean, they're not hitting for the guy.  He's lost.  He's not lost, but no decisions in a bunch of games where he gave up one lousy run.  Sometimes they've been shut out when he pitched.  His record is only, I think, 3-1 or 4-1.  He should be at least 7-0, 8-0 easily if he had a team that was hitting just a little bit for him. 
[03:34:30]  I agree.  Unbelievable at 42 years old.  That Astros team is just in shambles.  But that shows you an old team.  Right.  The Astros were old, and before Jeff Kent and Beltran moved on.  Right.  And then those two offensive juggernauts move on.  Bagwell just got surgery on his shoulder yesterday.  And you know what?  They just don't have anything left in the tank.  I think that's a team that ran on empty for a few years.  Well, his whole excuse going back to Houston was so he could pitch in front of his family 
[03:35:00]  and be around for his sons and stuff.  And he didn't have to go on the road with the team, right?  Yeah, well, he does go on the road sometimes, but whenever one of his kids have a game  or whenever he wants to leave and go and see one of his kids doing something,  he has that in his contract.  How do you feel about that?  I mean, because that's a new thing.  I have no problem.  You know what?  If he's the best pitcher on my staff, and the only way we can keep him is to keep him happy.  Nolan Ryan did that for about the last five years of his career.  Oh, he did.  I thought this was more of a new thing. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, he went back to his ranch when the team went on the road.  Yeah, you got to.  I mean, what a waste of time to have some of these big-time pitchers on the road sleeping  in hotel rooms when they're not even going to be used that whole series.  And he may be in better shape because, you know what?  When you go on the road, all you do is go drinking and do bad stuff.  Well, yeah.  So you could probably get in more trouble.  So it's probably bad that he goes home with the wife and kids.  Yeah, you got to, you know, hang out with your mistresses and stuff, you know?  Hey, Rob, the big question around town lately has been,  Louie Soho, first ballot Hall of Famer or no?  Louie Soho, he's not my first ballot. 
[03:36:00]  Hey, someone has a question for Rob Dibble.  Let's go to John in New York City.  John, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Dibble, I've got a question for you.  Can you tell the boys about the story about the tattoo on your ass?  Yeah, about each euro?  Yeah.  Yeah, I lost a bet in 2001.  You know, Rob, honestly, I don't know what the bet's about.  Could you help us out?  It was about, I never thought the guy would hit 300 or be any good in the major leagues.  And the guy not only won the batting crown that year, hit 350, led all the all-star votes. 
[03:36:30]  So I ended up getting his name tattooed in Japanese on my ass.  Oh, very nice.  Did you also have to run around Times Square in a diaper or something like that?  I ran around Times Square in a thong.  Yes, I did.  In a thong.  Disturbing.  It was very disturbing.  The pitchers were just awful.  Isn't it amazing, too, when you look at a guy like, back to Clemens,  350 would be considered an amazing career, as great as he is.  And yet, what was it, Cy Young won 511 games. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, and Cy Young completed about 400 games.  Yeah, they also, they just pitched.  Back in that era, first of all, you didn't have guys, you didn't have relievers.  And, you know, you faced, what, there's like eight teams in the league, you know.  So you got them figured out.  And those guys, I think he started, like, every other game for the team.  Yeah, I mean, these guys, you know, the rotation's a lot different in recent years, too.  I mean, it's tough to get a 20-game winner nowadays.  When we were growing up, you know, when we first all got into baseball,  there were a lot of 20-game winners because they pitched a lot more. 
[03:37:30]  They pitched double-headers, these guys, sometimes, both games with a double-header.  It was amazing.  Well, look at Bob Gibson's career.  Bob Gibson was the guy.  He'd start 35 times a year.  He'd complete 30 games a year.  Amazing.  But those guys knew, because they were raised from Little League on up, that there would be no help.  There would be no bullpen.  And now we've got so many specialists out there, which is not true.  There's not that many great relievers in the game.  But, you know, most teams think, I need the lefty in the bullpen.  I need the righty in the bullpen.  I need the closer. 
[03:38:00]  You know, the Mets went out and they got Danny Graves.  The Mets have one of the better bullpens in baseball.  What do you need Danny Graves for?  You already have a guy, Roberto Hernandez, who has over 300 saves setting up Braden Looper.  You know, now you need a guy who's got close to 200 saves helping out in the bullpen.  So, you know, every team panics when it comes to guys in the bullpen instead of just saying,  hey, you know what, you made your own mess in the seventh inning like Pedro last night.  You know, there's a guy, nobody thought he was going to be completing games this year.  And he's one of the better pitchers in baseball as far as going deep into ballgames. 
[03:38:30]  So, it's all about the fear factor.  I need to have...  What, they've got to eat stuff?  Bullpen, or I can't win ballgames.  I just think it's ridiculous.  But Boston, Boston back with Pedro, did blow a couple of critical games because they allowed  him to stay in because of his ego instead of yanking him when they should have for bullpen  help, I think.  I agree.  I agree.  And that's the manager's fault.  That's when you, you know what, your best pitcher in the staff talks you into it.  So, it's all about situation and knowing your guys.  All right.  And I think right now, Willie Randolph knows with Rick Peterson, one of the best pitching  coaches in baseball, that if Pedro's only thrown 80 pitches into the eighth inning, 
[03:39:00]  we'll leave him out there.  But it's when he gets to about 105, we've got to yank this guy quickly or we're in trouble.  All right.  People have a lot of questions.  Let's go to Arizona.  Chuck, go ahead.  We have Rob Bibble.  Yeah, I've got a question.  Hey, I hope you have to be in A-Sweet-Tit.  Hi.  I've got a question.  Randy Johnson left the Diamondbacks, and he has a pretty good pitcher there.  He goes over to New York, and he stinks.  So, you think it was a stupid career move or a brain fart for him to go to New York? 
[03:39:30]  No.  Now, if they're going to pay you 40 years, or $40 million for the next two years after this  year, I have no problem with that.  I mean, Randy was basically forced into that situation through the media and through, I think,  the Arizona Diamondbacks.  He did not want to leave Arizona.  He was from Arizona.  He lived in Arizona.  He wanted to stay there with his family.  And I think for him, he's doing it for the money.  And he's saying, whatever.  You want me to go there and bring prospects to the Arizona Diamondbacks?  And look at how good the Arizona Diamondbacks are this year. 
[03:40:00]  So, you know, here's a guy that was kind of forced to help his team, and now the Arizona  Diamondbacks are 31-28 with a lot of young prospects that the Yankees gave up.  Let's go to Virginia.  God, I'm fucking Steinbrenner.  Ken, what's up?  I love it.  Go ahead, Ken.  Ken, you're on the air, buddy.  You know who was a great GM, by the way?  Bob Watson was great.  Cashman stinks.  All right.  Rob, I guess he wants to ask you, are the A's going to trade Zito before the deadline? 
[03:40:30]  Why?  Zito sucks.  That's the last guy I would trade for.  I mean, people, this is one of the most overrated guys in the big leagues.  He's a flake.  The whole playing the guitar and the long hair and the zen crap.  I don't want that guy on my team.  I want a guy who, you know, like even Horatio Ramirez last night after Erstad took out Estrada,  first pitch to Erstad right behind him.  That's the guy I want on my team.  That he's going to protect his players and he's got some balls. 
[03:41:00]  Right.  But very Zito.  You know what?  The Oakland A's can have him.  They traded Mulder and Hudson.  And, you know, more power to Billy Bean and that Moneyball crap.  You know, Zito coming into spring training.  Oh, yeah, I'm the A's.  He hasn't done anything since he won the Cy Young.  Right.  So, no way.  I would not trade for Zito.  All right.  A couple more questions really fast.  Brian in Canada.  Ray, I was wondering if Anthony had matching capri pants.  What's that spag shirt he's wearing?  No, I'm not matching capri pants. 
[03:41:30]  Gotcha with that one, Ed.  Jack to Georgia.  Go ahead.  Hey, Roger.  You've been watching porn with your dog lately?  You watch porn with your dogs, Rob?  Absolutely.  I got a mad girl in a black lab and they love porn.  All right.  Punch now, guys.  That's great.  That's great.  You actually catch them watching?  Oh, my God.  I catch them doing even other things that are more disgusting.  You ever break out the peanut butter? 
[03:42:00]  Tax dude, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I don't feel like saying a word today.  What's up, Tax?  Rob, did you really empty out the shampoo bottles in the visiting clubhouse and take away the next  team to come in?  In the home clubhouses, too.  Wait, what would you do?  I would empty out the shampoo bottles and pee in them.  Really?  Wow.  Oh, that rocks.  Scumbag move.  That's fucking great.  Hey, all you baseball guys, you know stats like crazy, right? 
[03:42:30]  Sometimes.  What's the most unusual stat you know?  The most unusual stat?  Yeah, one that would just make people go, oh, my God.  This guy needs to get laid.  I got one if he doesn't.  Really?  Go ahead.  Because I'm not the biggest of stat guys.  Longest hitting streak was Joe DiMaggio.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, I figured I'd get obscure.  That's why, I mean, I...  56, I'm kidding.  I like listening...  Okay, but who had the second all-time?  Was it Pete Rose with 44?  Yeah, you're right.  That was good. 
[03:43:00]  Jimmy!  I was a little tired.  I am impressed.  Well, I was joking about the DiMaggio thing.  I was kind of just being silly, but...  Yeah.  I mean, I like listening to you baseball guys go out and talk and stuff, but when you guys  get into the whole stat thing, ugh, who cares?  Well, you know what?  You've got to be like Tim Kirchner and Peter Gammons and guys like that.  I mean, first of all, they've written for so many years.  I mean, Kirchner used to write for Sports Illustrated and Gammons wrote for the Boston  Globe.  And the one thing I've found since doing this job for the last seven years, when you write  stuff down, you remember it. 
[03:43:30]  And so all the stories that they've written throughout their careers, you know, they just...  They're able to retain that kind of thing.  You know who's amazing?  The guy you should talk to is Mel Kiper.  Mel Kiper can tell you like the, you know, on a depth chart, the sixth backup tackle on  Oklahoma, you know, in college football.  I mean, he is absolutely amazing, but he can do it in every sport.  I've never met a smarter guy working in this business.  Maybe Howie Schwab.  But Mel Kiper is... 
[03:44:00]  You want a stat guy?  That's the most amazing guy you'll ever find.  This is obscure, but there's a guy that works with Brother Wee.  He's a good friend of mine that does radio.  He does sports for Wee's.  He's like Rain Man when it comes to all this stuff as well.  You name a year, he'll tell you what team won the Super Bowl and all...  And what the score was.  And, I mean, just crazy stuff.  All right, Rob.  The big plug here.  The show's called The Show, Monday through Friday.  What?  It's on at 3 p.m.?  Yeah, 3 to 6, East Coast time.  East Coast time on home plate, obviously. 
[03:44:30]  XM 175.  Mm-hmm.  And, of course, Best Damn Sports.  Oh, yeah.  Best Damn Sports show.  Period.  On Fox Sports.  Rob, it's always a pleasure.  We're running out of show, so thanks.  All right, guys.  See you.  Program complete.  Val to the brethren.  Exactly.  We're running out.  All right.  Pete.  Come here.  Everybody.  Rob, you're running out of nowhere.  Feel free. 
[03:45:00]  Don't move right.  Yeah, you're running out of here.  Yeah, love.  Okay.  Engaged.  Provide. </pre>
