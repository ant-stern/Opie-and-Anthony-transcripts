<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about devastating floods in Australia, quickly veering into a profane debate about the Coriolis effect and toilet flushing direction.  Callers, including one identifying as an Australian Texan, provided geographical context for the floods, leading to discussions about Australian immigration policies and its Aboriginal population, touching upon Ayers Rock and Aboriginal-owned casinos.  This was followed by a comedic examination of a photo of Jim Jefferies with a Hitler-esque mustache.  The conversation then shifted to explicit and humorous anecdotes shared by callers about their school experiences, focusing heavily on gym class, locker rooms, female gym teachers, and even nude swimming classes.  A news story about two female teachers having sex in a classroom, initially disguised as a medical emergency, became a central topic.  The hosts also discussed online school commercials featuring attractive young people, anal cancer and reverse mortgage commercials, and a caller's story about a high school wrestling tournament with an unintentionally visible erection.  The segment concluded with discussions of the Kraft Macaroni and Cheese commercial's distinctive voiceover and an episode of *Hoarders* about a man living with thousands of pet rats.

The show continued with a graphic and deeply offensive discussion of a particularly disturbing *Hoarders* episode featuring Hannah and her unsanitary home filled with rotting food, feces, and dead and live animals.  The hosts, along with an unnamed third person, used highly offensive language to describe Hannah's appearance and actions, and discussed her family's enabling behavior. Clips from the episode were played.  A brief, humorous tangent involved an earthquake allegedly caused by excited Seattle Seahawks fans.  The hosts then reviewed *The Other Guys*, reminiscing (or rather, struggling to remember) a past appearance by Clark Duke and Seth Green to promote *Sex Drive*.  Further discussion of *Gulliver's Travels*, including a preview, followed, with the hosts criticizing the movie and Jack Black.  Dr. Michio Kaku briefly called in to comment on the psychology of hoarders.

The next segment focused on the Academy Awards and nominees, including "The Social Network," "The King's Speech," and "True Grit."  Roland, a guest in the studio, joined the hosts in debating the films' merits, particularly "The King's Speech," Colin Firth's performance, and the film's subject matter.  The conversation devolved into crude and offensive jokes about actors' appearances and bodies.  A lengthy and offensive discussion about the Arizona mass shooting ensued, touching on media coverage, political rhetoric, gun control, Sarah Palin, and other political figures.  The Second Amendment and gun control were also discussed.  Other topics included *Gulliver's Travels* (again), Jeffrey Rush's career, the Olsen twins and their potential use in "The Social Network," a Maxim Magazine photo of Olivia Munn (discussed with highly vulgar and sexually explicit language), plans for a "snow day" at the station, and derogatory and sexually explicit comments about Amy Winehouse, Kesha, and Blake Lively.

The final segment began with a discussion about Don Cherry's age, initially miscalculated by the hosts due to confusion with another Don Cherry (a singer and golfer).  This led to humorous banter and a frantic on-air search for the correct birthdate, with Travis, a staff member, implicated in the initial error.  A caller's comedically poor description of *Titanic* in broken English was followed by a series of increasingly absurd and offensive jokes, including imagined scenarios involving Japanese pornography and racial slurs.  The conversation then focused on Kanye West and Jay-Z's "Ham," with the hosts employing extensive racial slurs and graphic sexual descriptions.  A highly sexualized description of a sighting of Johnny Weir in the Sirius XM bathroom followed, alongside excessive focus on J-Lo's physical attributes. The segment concluded with a description of the hosts' creative meeting, interspersed with further offensive language and jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Folks, we love having the next guy on. He's the co-host of the Opie and Anthony show, the number one show in the history of satellite radio.  Please welcome Mr. Jim Norton. Jim, come on.  Hi, Mommy. Hi, Mommy. Hi, Mommy. Hi, Mommy. Hi, Mommy. Hi, Mommy.  Jay Leno gave us the big intro once again last night for Jim Norton's piece that he did for Leno.  I haven't seen it yet. I got it. I got it all DVR. I got to check it out later today. 
[00:00:30]  Fucking Australia is washing away. Yeah. Have you seen these floods? Huge floods.  Can I? Huge Aussie floods. I'm going to be stupid guy today. Where's the water coming from?  I nigh. It's not coming from the ocean, right? No, it's like raining.  But where the fuck is the water coming from? The rain.  But these floods are taking complete parking lots away. Big flash floods. Big flash floods from the rain.  Do they have other water? Yeah, there's like rivers and stuff. I forget what river it is, but something is like they've never seen it flood the way it's been flooded. 
[00:01:00]  I just realized I just don't know much about Australia. It's big. I really don't. Most people don't, and they like it that way.  The toilets flush the other way. They do? No.  I know most of... That's a myth. I know most of Australia... Really?  What? I'm pretty sure that's a myth. No, it's not a myth. That's busted.  No, it's not a myth. That water spins... No, because then what would happen right on the equator?  Does water just fall down the toilet? Yes. On the equator? Yes.  I remember Mr. Wizard showing me this, and it definitely spun the other way. 
[00:01:30]  I absolutely think water goes down a certain way in the toilet because the jets in the toilet make the water go down in that drain.  I'm going to have to do some research.  And I think what direction it goes down a drain has to do with the shape of the drain, where there's a block or something else.  I honestly do not think that it goes down counterclockwise and clockwise depending on your hemisphere north or south.  So another thing we learned growing up that's horseshit.  Why did I pay attention in school? Everything we learned is becoming horseshit. 
[00:02:00]  Is this like bullshit? Is that answer...  I'm still reading.  I know. I hate that answer, Yahoo Answers or whatever the fuck it is.  No, this is a different one.  It's not Yahoo Answers, but it's not something that I'm going to sit here and hold as gospel either.  The Australian toilet flushes straight down, it says.  What does that mean? Come on.  No toilet just sucks shit straight down.  Why? Unless they're on an airplane.  Yeah, yeah.  Why? They might have... Their plumbing is different, that's all. 
[00:02:30]  Well, what I was saying is, I don't know much about Australia.  No one does, by the way. No one does.  No?  They're their own little thing, and they don't want anybody to know anything about them.  Yeah, they...  Like, this is the first video I've seen from Australia in years.  There's flash flooding that's just taking complete parking lots away.  So then I'm thinking to myself, where's all this water coming from?  I get they have a little river here and there, but do they have a big fucking lake somewhere or anything like that?  It's a lot of land. I would assume they got lakes. 
[00:03:00]  A lot of wasteland, a lot of desert, right?  Yeah, the outback, like fucking, like Mad Max.  But where is the water coming from?  We have rivers and...  Rain and rivers.  You don't see flash floods like we're seeing this morning with this video.  I don't know.  Have you seen this video?  We get some pretty nasty floods.  Where?  California.  Not really.  Been raging pretty good.  Not really.  Lately?  Not really.  Mudslides?  Yeah, a little mudslide.  Man, they're just having like a bad one over there in Australia. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Australia.  Yeah.  Good eye.  Here's a guy that wants to help us out with Australia.  Wayne in Texas.  What's up, Wayne?  Hey.  Hey.  I'm Australian.  What do you need to know?  Where's the fucking water coming from?  It's coming off the mountains.  The...  Australia has mountains?  Oh, yeah.  Gotta have mountains.  Australia is 700 square miles smaller than the continental United States.  Yeah, but where's the mountains?  All I heard was they have some coastal... 
[00:04:00]  This is what I know about Australia.  And I'm not going to go with the kangaroo bullshit.  They have a couple coastal cities.  Wombat.  Maybe three or four.  And then the rest is just a big, huge desert in the middle of just nothingness.  And now I'm here in those mountains?  You've been watching too much Bad Max.  Yeah, see, look at that.  Where's the mountain?  Look by Victoria.  It's all green and nice.  Victoria and New South Wales.  Oh, it's beautiful.  You've got Sydney.  See, look at all the rivers.  Yeah, but where's the mountain? 
[00:04:30]  The mountains are right there.  We're Google Earth thing, and I don't see a mountain like the Adirondacks.  There's mountains right there.  They're huge.  They look like hills.  Remember the man from Snowy River?  No.  That's the Blue Mountains.  The Blue Mountains.  All right.  See, and then there's the big mountain range over there on the western Australia.  In the south of western Australia.  And there's a big river that comes out right there.  I think it's the Murray River that's filling up.  Murray.  Okay, Murray. 
[00:05:00]  One of my favorite vets, man.  Murray.  Maybe it doesn't make any sense.  Okay, Murray.  Ah, shit.  All right.  Murray River.  Yeah, look at that.  See, there's a lot of rivers and fucking lakes and shit.  Where are these flash floods, Wayne?  Well, it's raining and it's coming off the mountains.  No, I get it.  You told me about mountains and rivers, but where is the flash floods?  What part of Australia?  Victoria.  Victoria.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, that's pretty green and lush down there in Victoria. 
[00:05:30]  Why are there more houses in that area where it's nice and green?  Well, unlike America, Australia doesn't let anybody in there.  Ah, smart.  Why?  Smart.  Then how are we going to wreck it?  Yeah.  Exactly.  We all come over here.  But what could be so important in there that we're not allowed to walk around in that area?  It's actually a bunch of cows and...  They keep the immigrants out is what he's saying. 
[00:06:00]  I know.  See?  They're good like that.  They keep the immigrants out.  That's smart.  Stay out.  That's smart.  Yeah.  Man, that would be a long swim for a lot of immigrants.  Oh, my God.  Right?  You ain't paddling a Buick across a few 90 miles.  God, Australia is lucky if you really think about it.  In the middle of nowhere.  And then if you get close to Australia after you swim for about three straight months...  Three months.  Yeah.  Then the fucking sharks get you just as you start seeing land.  Yeah.  Surrounded by those motherfuckers. 
[00:06:30]  God, they're lucky over there.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's 10,000 miles from...  Well, it's 9,600 miles from LA.  And are you guys all just one color?  Well, we got some black fellas.  Yeah, they got those aboriginals.  Yeah, but you kind of keep them in their little area.  But I'm talking...  We treat our aboriginals like you guys treat your Indians.  Oh, wow.  So out of sight, out of mind, eh?  Just stick them on a reservation, give them a couple of cars and a case of whiskey, and  we're good.  And they haven't figured out how to build casinos yet, huh? 
[00:07:00]  Oh, yes, they have, mate.  Yeah.  Oh, they have?  Ah, wow.  I didn't know that, see?  In that area, it works out just like American Indians.  I did not know that.  About 10 years ago, there's a big rock in the middle of Australia called Ayer's Rock.  It creates about $300 million worth of tourist money a year.  Oof.  And the blacks decided that it was a sacred burial site, so they took half of it, and now  they get $150 million a year.  Wow.  That's something, man.  That is crazy money from Australia. 
[00:07:30]  All right, look.  We're learning a lot.  Yeah, look at that.  I didn't know they had casinos with the aborigines.  Did you see our pal Jim Jeffries, by the way, speaking of Australia?  What happened?  I like Jimmy, yes.  Jim's great.  He shaved his mustache.  He had a mustache?  Well, he must have grown one, and he shaved it into a complete Hitler mustache, like big  bushy one.  Right.  And he made his hair all Hitler-y.  What is he doing?  And took a picture.  Just for the fuck of it.  See, he needs to start drinking again.  It's very funny. 
[00:08:00]  I did not see that picture.  I got to check that out.  It was Twittered.  Yeah.  What is he on Twitter?  Jim Jeffries, J-E-F-F-R-I-E-S, if you want to follow Jim.  He's a good one to follow on Twitter.  Oh, no.  I do.  I follow him.  Oh, wait.  Now he's saying my new, oh, my God.  He's confusing, because he had to change his name from Jeffries to Jeffries.  But if you go there, you still get it, what I just said, right?  I don't know what you just said.  I just spelled out that.  It's this one.  Yeah, yeah.  Jim Jeffries. 
[00:08:30]  Jeffries.  J-E-F-F-E.  Jim Jeffries.  See, he was obsessed with keeping Jeffries when he realized he had to change the spelling  of the last name.  I would have just came up with, like, stone or something to make it easy for everybody.  But now, if you want to find Jim Jeffries, let's see.  J-E-F-F-E-R-I-E-S.  And there's his Hitler mustache.  He's insane.  Hitler mustache.  What is he doing?  He really looks like Hitler.  It's pretty cool.  What was his motive for that? 
[00:09:00]  Just shaving and decided he was going to walk around like that for a couple hours.  Maybe he wanted to look like Michael Jordan.  Well, no, Michael Jordan has the thin Hitler mustache.  Jim Jeffries went all out Hitler mustache.  He certainly did.  Big, bushy Hitler mustache.  He even did the swoop of the hair.  Yeah, yeah.  And he swooped his hair.  It's a pretty good shot.  What the fuck is he thinking?  Fucking Jeffries rules.  I think he's back in the States.  Maybe he's going to be in our area.  He should pop in then.  That would be nice.  He's a hoot.  I'll say a hoot. 
[00:09:30]  I'm the guy that calls in all the time.  I'm in the entertainment business.  I talked to Jimmy about Ozzy last time I called in.  Are you the guy that does concerts?  Yes.  See, I remember you.  Yeah.  I'm friends with old Pugs and Kelly.  Oh, that's right.  Very cool.  All right, Wayne.  Thank you so much, brother.  You learned a little something about Australia.  Yeah, I swear to God, I had no idea they had mountains.  Oh, yeah.  No clue.  Would you think it was just flat wasteland?  I told you, a couple coastal cities and a lot of fucking desert. 
[00:10:00]  That's really what I thought.  Big refinery in the middle.  Yeah.  Two days ago, I saw a rig that'll hold that tanker.  Exactly.  Yeah, the movie didn't help Australia then.  No, it really didn't.  This is all we know of Australia is from Mad Max movies.  And then that asshole who fucking walked around New York City.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Crocodile Dundee.  Crocodile Dundee.  Yeah, Crocodile Dundee.  And Mad Max. 
[00:10:30]  That's it.  What a fucking asshole.  That's all we know.  Yeah.  And we're going to get the toilet issue out of the way, too.  Rob, Garden City.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Anthony, with that toilet flushing myth that you mentioned earlier.  Yes.  I think it has more to do with the way water rotates in a water funnel than with flushing  down a toilet.  I think it rotates clockwise up here and counterclockwise down there.  You know, when it's just going to own a cord. 
[00:11:00]  That's the point.  But I'm not buying it.  No.  I heard.  I remember hearing that that is a myth.  I'm reading from multiple websites.  I'm talking out of my ass.  See?  All right, Rob.  Thank you.  We all heard that.  But multiple sites are saying that that's just a myth.  And then I saw some YouTube videos of people flushing the toilets in Australia.  Yeah.  See?  You can find anything these days.  Isn't that the best thing about the Internet?  Like, years ago, you'd just have to take someone's word for it and find a book or something. 
[00:11:30]  Like your teacher's word.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  What did that asshole know?  Well, probably nothing.  Because he learned it from some other asshole.  Yep.  Now you can just learn from assholes on the Internet.  But at least they're in the area where they can flush the toilet for you.  And then you could watch multiple fucking examples, too, to see if it's true or not.  Right.  You know?  You watch five guys flush their bowls.  You know, they're not all going to be full of shit.  When we were growing up, we learned there was one solar system, right?  With what?  Nine planets? 
[00:12:00]  Eleven planets?  How many planets?  Nine planets.  That's all.  And they said that's it.  That's all we got.  So that's wrong.  Blurry galaxies.  But they didn't acknowledge that.  They're like, that's nothing.  Yeah.  They're like, we don't know if there's other planets.  Yeah.  What are we up to?  About a million now?  We don't know.  At least a million.  We know there's galaxies with stars in them.  But we don't know.  We're almost ready to admit there's probably an infinite number of planets out there.  Oh, yeah.  We're almost ready to admit that.  All those stars with planets swinging all around them. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, whatever.  I can't believe it's taking this long for other people to be catching on to this.  I know.  It's just, to me, it's been common sense since I was a kid.  Like, I always had a problem with that growing up.  Like, how, what, like, this is it?  Are you kidding me?  Like, with everything out there and space being infinite, like, you're going to tell me that  there's no other planet out there?  A lot of people have these religious beliefs and think, like, yeah, it's just us.  That's crazy talk.  Because that's what God said and God made us and that was it.  Right.  So there is nothing else out there.  Are you allowed to go around saying things like that? 
[00:13:00]  I know.  It's ridiculous.  That's incredibly crazy things to say to people.  You've got to listen to Michio Kaku now.  We've got a physics teacher.  Mary in New York.  Hello?  How do you know physics?  You're a woman.  Oh, my God.  What did you do?  Get the teacher coffee?  Oh, my God.  That's all you got, Mary.  So which way does your tampon spin when you flush it down the toilet?  Well, that depends on which way the jets in the toilet are facing. 
[00:13:30]  That's what Ann said earlier.  Just like in the sink, it just depends on where the faucet is.  Now, you can get water to go down clockwise or counterclockwise, but you have to have a  tank like six feet deep by six feet in diameter, and it has to be completely and utterly undisturbed.  Right.  I get all that.  So that it's affected by Earth.  But anything that you're doing, flushing, sinks, anything, that's all just affected by  the faucet, the jets, anything like that.  All right. 
[00:14:00]  So no matter where you go on this planet, the water is going to rotate the same way, right?  Well, it depends on which way the jets in the toilet is.  No, we're not talking about plumbing anymore in a stupid funnel.  A funnel?  Yeah, a funnel's got too many other variables going on.  You're not going to see a clockwise or counterclockwise effect on a funnel.  All right.  Well, she thought she's talking about a funnel funnel, not what she was talking about earlier.  In a perfect situation, Missy, in a perfect situation without any outside fucking barriers 
[00:14:30]  and chaos and whatever else you would hear about.  Which way does water spin based on the hemisphere you're in?  Oh, it spins.  It will go clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the hemisphere if you have no other interference.  I don't believe that.  No, it's true.  It's been done.  But I don't believe it.  Where has it been done, Mary?  You don't have to.  I'm not some 12-year-old where I have to just listen to what you have to say.  I'm questioning you.  Where has it been done? 
[00:15:00]  I actually have a clip of it of a scientist filling a huge tank and keeping it undisturbed.  Okay.  And then you have to let the water drain very, very slow.  All right.  You really got to set up a perfect situation.  And the rotation of the Earth is what?  What?  It's got to do with the Coriolis effect and, yeah.  The rotation of the Earth?  Or is it something else? 
[00:15:30]  No, it's a whole bunch of other effects.  All right.  That makes it go clockwise or counterclockwise based on the hemisphere.  I don't believe it.  Steve's going to really...  Thank you, Mary.  We got Steve on Long Island.  That's really going to help us out.  Go ahead.  When I'm in a glory hole, the toilet is always spinning counterclockwise.  It was sometimes, Anthony.  Sometimes.  Yes.  Here's my opinion on it.  It's a very healthy opinion.  Who gives a fuck? 
[00:16:00]  Ah.  Now that is science I can get behind.  The who gives a fuck factor.  I remember seeing Mr. Wizard as a kid.  Yeah.  And they took like a spackle bucket, drilled a hole in the bottom, and then corked it.  Yeah.  Filled it with water, spun the merry-go-round or whatever, one way, pulled the cork.  Right.  Saw which way the water spun down the drain.  Yeah.  Refilled it, spun the merry-go-round the other way, and pulled the cork, and it went the 
[00:16:30]  other way.  And I could remember...  I always recall that as being the lesson.  Let me...  But I'll tell you something.  I don't think the Earth's rotation can have that kind of effect on something as small  as a spackle bucket or a toilet or anything else.  I think on a merry-go-round, yeah, you're going to get like an effect, perhaps.  I don't know.  I did believe that for a while.  Yeah?  Because I thought it until this very morning.  I thought it goes down the other way.  I don't believe it. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  All right.  Well, Matt in Rochester.  What do you got, Matt?  Hey, Matt.  Hey, first time in a long time, guys.  What's up, Matt?  No one gives a shit.  No, on Whale Wars, the guy got arrested when he jumped aboard the whale ship.  And when they were taking him back to Japan, he said he used to fill his sink up in his  room every day and let it drain out.  And when he was below the equator, it would go one way.  And then when he was on the equator, it just went straight down. 
[00:17:30]  And then, you know, vice versa, just so he could figure out where he was on, you know,  on the planet when they were taking him back.  I don't believe it.  Don't believe it.  You want to go with a plumber?  A plumber?  What is the plumber going to know about this?  Oh, my God.  We're in a fucking...  How much of his ass crack is exposed when he was watching the water go down the toilet?  Hi, plumber.  Go ahead, Billy.  Albany, yeah.  Well, my ass crack is always exposed.  But anyway, the water spins clockwise because the Earth spins counterclockwise in the northern 
[00:18:00]  hemisphere.  The siphon jet in your toilet blows the poop straight out.  Doesn't turn it in any direction.  Fill up your basin on your sink and pull the plug to see what the water does.  Yeah.  It spins clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere  because the Earth rotates the opposite direction.  You know, why isn't there, like, just an answer on the internet?  There should be an answer. 
[00:18:30]  Like, we're adults.  Our listeners are adults.  And we can't figure it out.  What are you doing?  I'm trying to figure this out.  You're just making gang symbols or something.  I am making gang symbols.  I'm making a globe with my fist and someone's standing on the Earth on the upper and lower  hemispheres.  And it's not helping me visualize this.  Yeah.  I'm not visualizing it.  Well, we're going to have to, uh, I don't know.  Yeah, check Snopes.  Go Snopes.  That's the, uh, do-all, end-all, be-all of internet, uh, course, shittery. 
[00:19:00]  You've got a high school teacher saying Anthony is right.  Uh, high school teacher from Connecticut.  John, what's up?  Hello.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good, John.  Hi, everybody.  This is a major misconception.  The changes from the, uh, forces of rotation of the Earth are so tiny as to be measurable.  Anthony is completely right.  Thank you.  I thought so.  You can't, uh, affect...  The Earth's rotation cannot affect...  Imagine what it would do to us if it's affecting water like that.  Oh, it would be... 
[00:19:30]  Right.  Oh, my God.  Spinning messes.  Oh, fuck it.  Yeah, you'd be dizzy.  All the time.  You'd have to let the water spill for days to see any kind of measurement in a tiny, tiny hole.  Yeah.  Everybody's just...  We've been taught this for years.  It's not true.  Right.  That's what I think.  All right, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Where's my...  Where's my diploma?  I need a high school diploma.  I never got one.  You don't need one.  Ah, it's a whole...  It's a whole principle thing with me now.  You're the only one.  I'm smart.  You don't really need one.  I was passed over for a diploma.  I'm smart and I was passed over. 
[00:20:00]  Then go to gym.  I know.  That's all you needed was to go to gym.  Who wanted to go to gym?  The worst...  Oh, God, I...  No, I would rather...  The worst excuse for not getting a high school diploma.  You didn't get one because you didn't go to gym.  I didn't go to gym.  You went to all the other classes that meant something.  Gym was a waste of time.  I hated gym.  What did gym accomplish?  Nothing.  It was stupid unless there was...  They were opening up that accordion and exposing us to the girls' side for some intersexual 
[00:20:30]  activity like square dancing when we were kids or...  What was the other...  Wasn't there something else that the girls and boys did together?  Like the presidential physical fitness test?  No, we did that separately.  We did that separate?  The only time was when you did the square dancing.  Square dancing.  Which, by the way, have you ever square danced again?  No, and I don't think they do that anymore.  Another thing they did in school that was a complete waste of time.  Yes.  What about crab soccer?  Crab soccer was the fucking best.  Did they do crab soccer with the girls?  Yes, they did.  Oh, and you could look up their pant legs? 
[00:21:00]  Yes, you could.  Of course you could.  And see their vaginas.  And see their crustaceans.  Everything I learned about the female anatomy I learned playing crab soccer.  Crabs?  From crab soccer?  Old crab soccer.  God, when that big wall opened up, it was like fucking, I swear to you, it was like  a science fiction movie with this big monolith opening, and you heard holy music playing.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  And there were girls.  There were girls on the other side, and they were dressed in their gym uniforms, little shorts 
[00:21:30]  and t-shirts.  And then the gym teacher said one day, hey, we could look up all their shorts.  Oh, crab soccer.  We should have spent a game.  Crab soccer.  It's our old bit.  Danny's on to something.  But the fucking gym teachers were all the pervs, and they would come up with shit.  Why did we need to climb ropes in gym class?  Yeah, the rope thing.  And why did the gym teacher need to be the guy that held the rope at the bottom?  So you could see your young, smooth scrote. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  Figure all that shit out.  Chicks played volleyball for 45 minutes.  Dude, at Harborfields High School, I'll say it again, the fucking gym teachers all the  office was right in the locker room.  Yeah.  All their offices were in the locker room.  And that's when I finally realized what a lesbian was.  It's a female gym teacher.  She was a lesbian.  Yeah.  And her office, it was a glass office, was in the locker room.  Yeah.  Is that the greatest job ever? 
[00:22:30]  It's just a treat for her.  I say yes.  It's a treat.  You think our jobs are great?  I want to be a lesbian gym teacher at Harborfields High School.  Sitting in a glass office in the middle of a locker room.  Right.  With 16, 17, and 18-year-olds getting naked in front of you.  Holy shit.  It could be the best thing ever.  You tell me a better job in America.  And she just loves them all.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  A teacher in a junior high school.  Yeah.  I am telling you, unless they changed it, that was the situation at Harborfields High School. 
[00:23:00]  And the only reason we knew was because of the hole in the wall in the coach's office  where we got to see into the locker room.  Spiky, dikey hairdo.  I'm sure they covered up that hole years ago because I've been out of school a while now.  Yeah.  But the fucking office was right in the middle of the locker room.  Great.  You've got to be shitting me.  Yeah, that would be amazing for a lesbian.  Do you think she ever called in sick?  Never.  Do you think...  Imagine the fantasies she was able to have while her dyke fucking girlfriend licked her 
[00:23:30]  out.  She's just dreaming about the homecoming queen's bush.  She never retired.  They probably had to drag her out of there.  Force her out.  Kicking and screaming at 70 years old.  Like, I still have five more years.  I know I can do this.  Imagine how jealous they are, the ones these days, because of digital cameras and everything.  Right, right, right.  Back then, you couldn't...  Do you think her panties shattered every day when she took them off on the floor?  Dropped them on the floor in the class?  Can you imagine... 
[00:24:00]  You wake up as the lesbian gym teacher.  Yeah.  With a pep in your step.  You can't wait to get to school.  Another day, another dollar!  Just set up in your glass office and wait for the fucking girls to come in to change  for gym class.  Looking around.  Holy shit.  I'd just be on a rotating seat, just spinning like a radar.  Like a radar dish.  So that's why they had zero period gym.  They just couldn't...  You couldn't wait.  You just woke up.  It was like, I gotta go to work now!  I'm in! 
[00:24:30]  And look, we were too young to understand that there could be gay people among you, homosexuals,  lesbians, all that.  I didn't know half that shit when I was growing up.  But the principal must have knew.  Oh yeah, they were all goofing on her, probably, on the lesbian gym teacher.  You think he...  And, you know, he wasn't allowed in the women's locker room.  No.  But the lesbian teacher certainly was.  Holy shit.  You ever do any extracurricular activities, and then you're in school, and you're able 
[00:25:00]  to, after school hours, go into the girls' locker room, and just standing in there was  boner-inducing?  Just standing there.  But you could even go a step lower than that.  Just going into the girls' bathroom.  Bathroom.  Right, right.  At a high school, it was like, holy shit.  Boner-inducing!  Because you knew the girls that were hot, and they were using it, and they were...  The mirrors saw them naked.  Right.  The mirrors saw them naked.  You're so right.  It was fantastically sexual.  It was such a turn-on, and there wasn't a woman in sight. 
[00:25:30]  It was just...  No.  You would sneak in the women's bathroom just to check it out real fast.  No filthy urinals in there.  You felt just dirty.  Oh, it was great.  You just looked at the toilet seats and knew, knew the quality of twat that was sitting  down on that bowl.  Here we go.  Here's the bit.  We do it every once in a while, but Phil in Buffalo, here we go.  Phil?  Go ahead, Phil.  Yes.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Morning, Phil.  Seventh, eighth, and ninth grade in our junior high, we used to have to swim nude the whole 
[00:26:00]  class.  Now, we heard about this.  What?  No bathing suits.  All the guys used to line up, and you'd shower, and then you had to go walk into the pool.  It was like a freaking prison camp.  Sounds like...  And who came up with that rule, and why?  We used to have to take diving naked.  Jim Teacher, gay gayman.  Gay gayman.  Fag faggerman. 
[00:26:30]  You used to have to stand on the head of the diving board and bounce up and down.  Yes.  That's a water polo naked, you know, and the guys would grab your head and show me the water.  And you would think that Phil's doing this to get on the radio.  I'm telling you, we could get another ten of these in a second.  Yeah.  What the fuck is this about?  Unbelievable.  I remember this.  What the fuck?  People said this.  It had to be against the law.  It had to be against the law.  Well, now it is.  I don't think they're doing it anymore.  No way.  They got away with murder when we were growing up. 
[00:27:00]  Now, Anthony, did you have to do that when you were young?  Never.  I wouldn't take my clothes off for shit.  I used to get, like, and the reason I failed Jim a lot was because I would just wear my jeans and shit.  And I would be in the gym, like, wearing jeans because I didn't even want to change into my shorts.  I was all scared.  Yeah, I hear you.  All right, man.  Hey, if we're talking about school, hopefully one of the guys can find it.  I forgot what paper it was in.  I think it was, I want to say the Sunday papers. 
[00:27:30]  There's a great lesbian teacher story.  Two teachers going at it in a room upstairs while there was one of those assemblies going on.  An assembly?  An assembly was going on downstairs, and a guy walked into a dark classroom to see these two teachers going at it.  Was it the janitor guy that walked in?  No, there's a new one.  Oh, it's a new story?  And then the one teacher said that she was helping the other teacher out because she was having some diabetic thing happen. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, you got to lick their pussy when they're diabetic.  That's what the guy's saying.  Like, her legs were up in the air, and the other teacher's head was between the legs.  She was testing her blood sugar.  You got to test and see how sweet.  You found it already.  How sweet her pussy is.  Read this, Anthony, nice and slow.  Lesbian triced teacher.  Could you get bigger font?  Because I want to enjoy the reading.  Oh, look at the two of them, too.  Yeah, they're pretty hot.  Was just getting a sexy insulin shot, is the headline.  Yeah.  We're looking at a girl. 
[00:28:30]  One is Asian, I believe.  A little bit.  A little bit Asian-ish looking.  And the other one is just kind of a girl next door looking...  Sure.  Nice.  They both look in shape.  Yeah.  Trim.  Yeah, they look...  They're like lipstick lesbians.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not the dikey kind.  Not that crazy one.  Let me see.  James Madison High School.  Yes.  James Madison High School teacher Alini Brito was fired last week for allegedly having sex  with a co-worker, Cindy Morrow. 
[00:29:00]  In an empty classroom in November 2009, a janitor caught them with their pants down and tops off.  But Brito said it wasn't sex.  It was a medical emergency.  See, Brito claims she was a diabetic and invited Morrow upstairs to, quote, check her blood sugar  and give her...  I was kidding when I said that.  Yeah.  And give her an insulin shot.  We've totally seen this movie before.  Once upstairs, Brito claims she felt weak and laid down on the floor. 
[00:29:30]  She also took off her sweater to use as a pillow.  And Morrow put a chair under Brito's legs to aid her circulation.  I guess that's put.  I guess it's fucked up.  Morrow put a chair under Brito's legs to aid her circulation.  Morrow claims she was fully clothed at the time and the room was dark so the janitor could  have just let his imagination run wild.  However, school safety officer Ruth Reyes, who saw the scene...  Now, I'm sure Ruth Reyes isn't a lipstick lesbian. 
[00:30:00]  Ruth Reyes is the buzzkill in the story.  She saw the scene and she claims Brito was naked on the floor.  And I saw the blonde between her legs and when I opened the door, she looked up and told me,  shut the door!  Despite the testimony, state arbitrator Mary Krangel, another one, ruled that, quote,  there is no possible medical non-sexual assistance that a partially naked person could possibly 
[00:30:30]  be rendering to another naked person in the position described.  Can you read that again, please?  Despite the testimony, state arbitrator Mary Krangel ruled that, quote,  There is no possible medical non-sexual assistance that a partially naked person could possibly  be rendering to another naked person in the position described.  Boo!  Boo!  Boo! 
[00:31:00]  What was the final line in that story?  Nothing?  Okay.  That she probably just had a case of hysteria.  Maybe it was just medical, uh, and sexual.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Is that a hot story?  That's fucking hot until fucking old Krangel got in there.  Yeah, good old Krangel.  Reyes.  Thanks, Krangel.  Wow.  Yeah, and they're, uh, they're pretty good looking.  Here, I gotta...  Hot story.  I gotta go to the... 
[00:31:30]  Oh, please.  Did he hang up?  Okay, good.  Uh, let's go to Stu in Detroit.  Stu.  Because people are shocked.  They're like, there's no way a school would allow kids to swim and dive naked.  But there was a time that this shit was happening.  I think they cleaned up the schools a little bit, but, uh, you go back a little bit, and  yeah, you'll get a lot of these stories.  Oh, please.  Stu, go ahead.  Uh, well, when I went to Detroit High School back in the late 60s, we had pool once a week,  and it was all sanitary, and you always wore...  You couldn't wear anything in the pool. 
[00:32:00]  It was always naked.  You had 50 or 60 guys in the pool with this old clown gym teacher sitting on a diving board.  He was watching all this stuff, and he wanted us to practice life-saving techniques.  You know, all these young guys putting their hands over you, hands on their arms and backs,  letting everything around.  It's just a fucking...  What?  You know, you're 15 years old.  You don't know what the hell is going on.  Why did you have to practice life-saving techniques naked in a pool while the teacher's  on a diving board getting the perfect angle at your young, supple butts? 
[00:32:30]  I mean, all the smart guys came in with a doctor's excuse why they couldn't go in the  pool, but the rest of us didn't know.  We would wind up every Wednesday.  That's crazy.  That is crazy.  That's crazy.  They're not doing it now, but for four years, we had to do that.  I got to talk about what else is hot.  Not only naked boys in the pool.  Have you seen these commercials for online school?  No.  Where the girls are like, you could study in your pajamas. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  And it's these hot-looking little college chicks dressed in, like, boy shorts and little fucking  shirts and talking about how they're getting their education in their pajamas online.  It is jack-off material, my friend.  Fuck you.  Jack-off material.  You saw that commercial, and I saw the one where they got the guys talking about how,  you know, not only can you get HIV, you can get anal cancer.  Have you seen those yet?  I posted a picture of the anal cancer one last night.  I'm like, what the fuck is going on? 
[00:33:30]  And then I posted the other one with the old broad talking about her reverse mortgage,  and she's the old broad with the red sweater and the giant tits.  I haven't seen that one yet.  Have you seen her?  No.  Holy shit.  I see that one, too.  Yeah.  Giant-ass tits.  They're getting out of control with the commercials.  This guy wants to share a gay high school wrestling moment with everybody.  Gay high school.  And, of course, any wrestling.  And, of course, Buffalo again.  I know you guys have long winters, but what the fuck?  Put your clothes on.  Go ahead, Scott. 
[00:34:00]  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, prepare your gay wrestling jokes, by the way.  Big high school wrestling tournament.  Everybody's freaking naked.  About 100 guys in a small gym getting ready to weigh in.  Of course, everybody's within a quarter pound of making weight.  And it's dead silent because nobody's eating in about three days.  And all of a sudden, you hear a guy scream, he's got a boner.  And everybody freaking just gravitates to the side of the freaking gym.  And the guy's scrambling for their clothes because you're afraid this guy's just going to attack you. 
[00:34:30]  He's got a boner.  Yeah.  They yelled it like he's got a grenade.  He's got a boner.  Well, it's just as dangerous.  If everyone's naked, it's just as dangerous.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  And for two days straight.  Did someone have to jump on the boner to save everybody else?  Somebody jumped on.  Kowalski jumped on the boner.  We lost Kowalski.  You know, Krangle wouldn't have jumped on the boner.  Jump on that boner. 
[00:35:00]  I have a feeling that Krangle doesn't like boners.  Krangle.  That buzzkill.  Well, there you go, Scott.  That's a wonderful story.  That and that move that we were talking about.  That move that was in the news.  That wrestling move where you shove your finger up the guy's ass.  Right.  Right in his asshole as you're wrestling with him.  Yeah, we learned that, right?  Yeah.  On a past show.  All right, let's go to Atlanta.  This is happening all over the place.  I love this bit.  I know we do this from time to time, but it's worth it every time.  Michael, Atlanta, what do you got? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, Ant, I got you beat on the square dance, and we run out of girls, so they failed us  because we wouldn't square dance with guys.  Oh, you can't square dance with a guy.  Wait, so if there wasn't enough women, they forced you to do square dancing with a guy?  Well, yeah, my class only had like three or four girls, and it was like 19, 20 guys,  so you'd have to square dance with guys.  But, hey, man, my buddy, we went out through the, uh, we went out through the, uh,  I hate to tell you this, but square dancing isn't that important.  How do you promenade with a guy? 
[00:36:00]  Right.  I don't want a do-si-do with a homie-mo.  That was such a bad one.  Yeah, it's like, well, all right, thanks for the hell of it.  Boo!  Uh, yeah, the sex with the student, we've done that.  This is more about...  We've done that.  This is more about the fucking uncomfortable, why do I have to be naked swimming in front  of you stories.  Uh, somebody in Jersey, what's your name, sir? 
[00:36:30]  What's up, man?  Hi.  It's Scott from Jersey.  All right, what do you got, bro?  Uh, I got another moment in high school about wrestling.  Our one friend, I won't say his name, but he was one of these uncomfortable kids who liked  to make things very fucking weird for people, so when he was wrestling, we were all in the  crowd one day, he looks up at us while the kid he's wrestling is on his stomach and takes  his two fingers and holds them up and looks at us and puts them right up the kid's ass. 
[00:37:00]  Like he presented his fingers first?  I swear to fucking God, man.  Like, ta-da.  We all just start cracking up.  This kid also used to purposely try to get boners before he went into the shower during wrestling.  Just to make people uncomfortable.  What an asshole.  No, that goes, that segues into one of our greatest bits ever.  Uh, gay or funny?  Gay or funny?  Forcibly getting boners to go back in the locker room and shower after wrestling matches.  Is that gay or funny? 
[00:37:30]  I think that's a rare case of both.  The guy was gay.  The guy was gay.  Okay.  But he decided, look, I could make this funny.  I might as well, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll make this funny.  Wow, okay.  So, yeah.  The kid's probably actually listening right now, so I hope he doesn't recognize it.  One big thumbs up for that guy.  All right.  Two fingers up.  I'm pretty sure he's going to recognize it if he's listening.  How many other kids in your high school presented their fingers?  They fucking rammed him up another kid's ass and got boners in the locker room.  I'm pretty sure the cat's out of the bag now. 
[00:38:00]  Where was Crangle when this was happening?  Crangle should have been on the case.  I so hate the name Crangle now.  Crangle.  Fucking ruining that lesbian story.  Oh, man.  The square dancing thing?  Mm-hmm.  It was so fucking sexual.  So sexual.  They didn't understand the fucking fury that put in your fucking pants.  How many guys ran to locker room stalls or whatever, bathroom stalls, and just whacked it?  When we were doing the square dancing, it was kind of at that age, just before you started jerking off and shit. 
[00:38:30]  Like, it was just, you knew something was really sexy about what you were doing with these girls.  You would touch, you wouldn't get the opportunity to touch another girl.  Of course not.  And then they throw you together, and you're like, you have your hand around, there's one  like square dancing move where you'd have your hand around her waist, and she'd have her  hand around your waist, and you're holding hands in front, and you'd have to do some dumb  fucking, you know, move like that.  And then your hand is like on her shoulder and on her waist, and you're touching her, 
[00:39:00]  and this is the first time you're actually touching another girl besides your mom or your sister or some shit.  And going with something you've said many times on the show, for that age, that was hardcore sex.  That was sex!  That was just as good as having crazy sex right now.  I remember, like, my heart started beating so hard, my palms were sweating, I was doing  the erratic fucking breathing thing. 
[00:39:30]  I swear to God, I was so fucking horned up for just touching a girl.  And that was grammar school, so it was like 11 or 12 years old.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember it.  Yep.  Washington Drive School.  I'm going local today.  It was crazy.  Yeah.  You'd get on the line across from the girls and trade off.  You'd be like, one, two, three, four.  You'd count, like, one, two, three, four.  Who am I partnered up with?  And then you'd count one of the guys.  You're like, dude, could you switch off with me?  I want to get her.  But they were doing the same shit to us, too.  Yeah.  No wonder the girl always moved whenever I moved into position. 
[00:40:00]  It was like fucking some kind of weird football lineup.  And I bloomed late, so.  She's calling audibles.  She's calling, yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, my fucking, ha, ha, ha, the girl across from me is calling audibles.  What the fuck?  Stay lined up, you bitch.  Yeah.  I want to touch you.  I bloomed so late, I watched the girls fucking moving around so they didn't get me.  Did they want you?  Oh, fuck no.  Yeah.  I fucking hit puberty a little too late for all that shit. 
[00:40:30]  I got in good with my sense of humor, but it didn't pull off getting the girls at square dancing.  I wound up getting this girl that was the head of the itty-bitty titty committee.  Really?  Yeah, she was a real skinny, like, thing.  I always got the smart.  Pam.  My name was Pam.  I always got the smart girl with morals.  Morals?  Yeah.  Like, all the girls kind of had morals back then.  We got fucked over.  I mean, now girls will fucking suck you a dick right there in school. 
[00:41:00]  Trust me.  Trust me, Jesus Christ.  All right, well.  Blow jobs.  You couldn't bring up blow job.  Hell no.  Holy shit.  I remember the first time I tried to broach the subject of a girl perhaps giving me a blow job.  And it was after sex.  It was after we had had intercourse.  And she thought you were crazy, right?  Because that was going...  She kind of was like, well, I want to, but I don't know how to do it. 
[00:41:30]  And then her friend, her best friend, this other girl that I knew and shit, wound up telling me, she goes, yeah, she came to me and asked, like, should I practice on a banana?  Like, so she kind of wanted to get it right.  I got to give her, you know, credit for that.  But it was, it had to be two months after we had had sex that she decided, you know, she would give it a try.  Give it the old college try.  The old high school try of giving me a little oral. 
[00:42:00]  Was it a nightmare?  No.  Any time your penis was in a girl's mouth at that age was good.  Any!  I remember one time in Geneseo.  How old were you?  That was college.  Yeah, but I'm talking about a time that it was a complete nightmare.  Yeah, but I'm...  I'm talking about where this girl had no fucking clue and the teeth were involved to the point it was ridiculously uncomfortable.  Right, I know, yeah.  But following your lead there, you're like, well, fuck, you know, it's still in her mouth. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  So you keep going with it.  Yeah.  It was a fucking nightmare.  See, but I'm talking high school.  I'm talking like 15, 16 years old.  We were on different levels.  I didn't even get close to any action in high school.  See, because by that age...  I got nothing in high school.  By that age, you can say like, all right, it's a blowjob.  It's good because it's a blowjob, but she's doing it pretty poorly and it's kind of hurting and stuff.  At 16, you don't give a shit if she's using a fucking McCulloch chainsaw.  It feels good in her mouth. 
[00:43:00]  Fuck it.  Right.  I think I've said this before.  I didn't lose my virginity until I was in college.  I was that guy.  I'm telling you, I fucking matured way too late for all this shit.  And I know you were all in very early.  Oh, I remember getting the one from this girl.  I was at this, it was at a fucking park in back of a school.  And she was hammered on some Bacardi and decided she's just going to like... 
[00:43:30]  She was drunk like that chick in Superbad in the bedroom.  Oh, really?  I am going to give you the best blowjay.  Look what I got for you.  Look what I got.  She was that fucked up.  And she like kneels in front of me and starts...  She also had braces.  And it fucking was...  I was wincing.  I was actually going like...  Like wincing, but didn't tell her to stop.  Right.  It was great.  Yeah, that's the quandary though.  It was like a carrot peeler. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It was like a cheese grater.  Yeah, here we go.  Chisel.  Let's go to Chisel in PA.  Hi, Chisel.  We used to have a gym teacher that used to, after gym class, come into the shower room  and make sure we took a shower before we got dressed.  Oh, yeah.  I know those gym teachers too.  Had a few of them.  I'd always scoot out.  Now that you're all older, Chisel, you got to think the guy was gay, right? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, absolutely.  Because what straight man would give a fuck if you showered after gym class?  And we had this one kid, I think it was in like 8th or 9th grade.  He was hung like a horse.  We found out later that it was only in our gym class that he came in to watch us take a shower.  Oh, he wanted to see the big cock kid.  He's a size king.  Yeah, he wanted to see the guy with the big dick. 
[00:45:00]  Most people know I did a lot of sports and I was a big time runner in college and one of the fucking runners was a big cock kid.  Big cock kid.  And we were all like, really, could you just fucking go over there and shower?  We had one kid in the class too.  Yeah, big cock kid.  Big cock kid and like full massive pubes and shit.  And he's in there and he's showering like a man, like one arm's up.  He's under his armpit, his hairy armpit with a bar of soap.  And he's just looking around. 
[00:45:30]  He's running his fingers through his hair like, yeah, I'm showering.  I'm a man.  And all of us are like walking there shaking.  Yeah, you're just happy that you're starting to sprout some pubes.  Just the worst.  Just a couple.  I knew a guy in high school and he was a big cock guy.  I didn't go to high school with him.  But I had heard about because a friend of mine had gone to school with him.  And we were talking one day and he was telling me, now this is high school.  And he was complaining to me that it's a curse to have a big dick because all the chicks complain that it hurt. 
[00:46:00]  And I was just like, I'll take the dick.  I'll fucking take the dick, dude.  That old gag.  Shut the fuck up.  You'll find a size queen.  Yeah, exactly.  You'll find a size queen that'll take it.  Exactly.  Wow.  Big, big cock guy in the shower at school.  Jim Norton has arrived.  You missed a fine first hour.  We were just talking about school and my sandwich.  And showering and gym class and lesbian gym teachers. 
[00:46:30]  Did you hear what I did?  I know.  Poor Jimmy.  It's on the cover of all the papers.  Looks good.  Crazy guy.  Crazy gunman.  Enough with him.  You know who, I was saying this before, you know who is one of the saddest victims of this  whole thing?  Is Golden Voice Guy.  Boy, did he get thrown off of everything when this shooting happened in Arizona.  But I think in this case it's good because we learned that Golden Voice Guy has nine kids 
[00:47:00]  that he abandoned.  And they were about to go with that fucking angle.  They were ready to roll with that one?  And said, ah, fuck that.  We got this situation in Arizona.  Yeah, so the Golden Voice Guy's gone.  You hear Golden Voice Guy's Kraft commercial?  Yeah.  It's fucking good.  Nah, you know what?  We were talking about this the other day.  It doesn't fit.  It's too over the top.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Kraft macaroni and cheese.  Is it too much?  Kraft macaroni and cheese.  The voice is just ridiculous. 
[00:47:30]  It really is.  I haven't heard a voice like that on the radio in a long time.  George Taylor Morris was up there and a couple other guys.  Yeah.  There was a, who was the black guy that was a legend, N.E.W., and he did sports.  Somebody will get the name.  Lou Gossett Jr.?  Lou Gossett Jr.  Roscoe?  Roscoe, yes.  Roscoe had a hell of a voice.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Kevin knows his radio and voice shit.  Out of his fucking ass.  Here's the Kraft commercial.  Which, by the way, is brilliant on Kraft's part because what I'm seeing on TV is everyone 
[00:48:00]  is playing the Kraft commercial for free.  Oh, so they're not buying ads on TV, but every TV show is playing.  Let's go, look, his first spot, and this is what it is.  Brilliant on their part.  Kraft home-style macaroni and cheese.  Cheesy noodles topped with golden brown breadcrumbs.  You know you love it.  God, that's a fucking voice.  Kraft macaroni and cheese.  That's what it looks like on the inside of my underwear.  It's not over the top because he's just doing the tag at the end. 
[00:48:30]  He's not doing the whole spot.  If the whole spot was like that, it would be awful.  It's just strange because no one on TV sounds like that.  Not even movie trailers really do that anymore.  When we were growing up, there were a lot of guys like that.  That's why they're saying golden.  The golden age.  A lot of people had the golden voice.  That's what radio used to be about.  It didn't matter what you said.  It was your voice that got you hired.  And they did away with that horseshit years ago.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:49:00]  So it's kind of cool to hear a guy like that again because we haven't heard it in a while.  I'm liking your haircuts.  Digging that polyester look.  The 70s.  They were called 70s boss jocks.  Boss jack.  The boss jack.  And that was all about having a really good voice.  Yeah.  And that's all they cared about.  So why don't we do our first break?  Eat time.  Yum, yum.  What the fuck?  You said golden voice Ted Williams?  Ah, we'll figure it out.  Tim Norton is back from L.A.  Tino's back.  Yes, I am.  There's something, though.  Ah, we'll figure it out during the break. 
[00:49:30]  Stay there.  Morning, morning, morning.  So Hoarders went down last night, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Season finale?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nah, meh.  It's a little disappointed, to be quite honest with you.  Can you give me a little credit?  Big season finale.  A little credit, please.  You said it.  You said it.  So the guy, Rat Guy.  They ended with Rat Guy.  Ended with Rat Guy.  He had about 1,500 or so rats in his house. 
[00:50:00]  But they were the pet store type rats.  Not your sewer rat.  Still kind of skeevy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not going to say it's not skeevy.  It would skeeve me out.  When you've seen a subway rat, and then they show you those type of rats, it's a big drop-off.  They'd run around his house all over the place.  He would dump feed on the floor, and they would eat.  And they lived in him, and he loved his rats.  He loved them.  And it was 2,000 rats, 2,500 rats. 
[00:50:30]  I'm getting different numbers, but whatever it was.  He got a lot of fucking rats.  That's all you need to know.  I think they got 2,000 out.  2,000?  Me?  Travis.  Travis.  Hi.  I'm supposed to intro everybody when I talk to you.  Hey, guys.  It's Travis.  And that's Danny.  That's going to talk next.  And Jimmy's over there.  Who said to intro everybody?  That's terrible advice.  I'm chilling.  It gets confusing if you don't know who's talking.  No, it doesn't.  No, you figure it out.  Yeah.  You listen.  Right.  I don't think people give a fuck who's talking as long as it's entertaining or funny in the end. 
[00:51:00]  It doesn't matter if all of a sudden Danny or Travis's pressure is on now.  I know.  So what were you saying, Travis?  Well, Opie, they got 2,000 rats out.  And then one of those little blurbs at the end said that after they left, he found another 350.  Oh, that's it.  And gave them away.  Rat guy.  2,300.  But he wasn't sleeping with them anymore, right?  He had to sleep at his office.  I remember seeing the preview. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because he was sleeping at one point.  They were pulling his hair out and making bedding with it and nesting with it.  They were pulling his hair out?  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  And they were licking any moisture off his lips, nose, and eyeballs when he was sleeping.  How do you sleep?  Like, if my wife just rolls over, I wake up.  Yeah, rats pulling your hair out.  How do you sleep as rats are nibbling at you?  To make their nests.  That's a little much.  Jeez, you think he's a deep sleeper?  Yeah, apparently so.  What the fuck? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, so it wasn't as disgusting.  It was creepy.  It was skeevy to have, like, that many rats.  It just, you know, you have this kind of, I don't know, primal, ugh, when it comes to rats.  You know?  Humans don't really like them.  So, uh, it wasn't as gross, though, as the week before with crazy fat bitch rotting meat in the refrigerator.  Yeah.  She should have been the finale because that bitch, you wanted a fucking choker. 
[00:52:30]  And this guy, you just honestly just felt bad for him.  Yeah, they did good on the season premiere, which was, which was that lady who just threw the bags of shit up on her stairs.  Right.  Love that one.  Right one.  That was just probably the only one I saw all year.  That was just, that set the bar.  Right.  And then last week, last week with a fat pig yelling, yelling at her children and her fucking relatives and, uh, just so selfish.  What, it's hard for her, though.  It's hard for her.  Oh, God. 
[00:53:00]  She had giant fat waddle under her chin.  Her arms were just lumps of fat hanging off the bottom of her arms.  Like, she's yelling, walking on dirt with a walker and yelling at her children.  And what was she hoarding?  Everything.  And she was a disgusting hoarder, too.  Like, the, uh, the, open up the fridge and it was just disgusting shit rotting in her refrigerator.  And they're all, they're all talking about how good they are at cooking. 
[00:53:30]  And I'm a great cook.  And they got to cook on a hot plate because the stove is covered with cats.  And, and, and what are they eating?  And they're sitting there eating on a stool in the middle of shit.  Jesus.  Ah, it's disgusting.  I hated this woman.  How do you live like that?  Hated her.  Look at her.  Look at her big, dumb fuck face.  How do you live like that?  I don't know.  We got the clips from last week.  Oh, yeah.  Because the season finale wasn't that great.  And this is the one you've been obsessed with for a while now.  You loved this, uh, episode of Hoarders. 
[00:54:00]  I wanted a fucking speed bag, her fucking chin.  That big, lumpy chin.  Yeah, but the thing is, it's hard to get rid of stuff.  She's having a tough time.  You gotta go slow with her.  Shut it.  Eat that.  What's her name, Hannah?  Yeah.  Yeah, Hannah.  Let's, let's meet Hannah.  I'm Hannah.  And I'm a cotton-picking ridge runner stump jumper.  And damn proud of it.  You're not somebody.  Shut up.  Dumb hick.  I raise chickens. 
[00:54:30]  Aw.  Ducks, peas.  Aw.  Turkeys, goats, sheep.  All right, I'm coming now.  She raises and kills them.  Yeah, I hear you.  No wonder, I'll slap you, you don't miss them.  The conditions are hard.  Damn, dead gone you.  Uh, don't throw away anything that I can use later.  No.  I don't call it a hoarder.  I call it keeping what you need to bag ushing when you don't have money to go buy it later.  Yep.  You know, who is she hurting in the end? 
[00:55:00]  Besides her family, who gives a fuck about her and her family?  My, my anger.  Is she hurting her neighbors?  Yeah, yeah.  They were close?  Yeah, she's hurting her, her neighbors.  It's just, yeah, she's hurting, and, and the animals themselves.  If you, if you're, if you're into, like, not seeing animals be tortured, then you'd,  you'd fucking hate this woman.  But it's chickens.  She put chickens in, no, it's, it's like every kind of animal.  She got all kinds of fucking animals.  Okay.  And the chickens, like I said, had shit in the cage so deep that they were squished between 
[00:55:30]  the shit and the top of the cage.  Okay, that's right.  And she hoarded a dead chicken.  She had chickens.  She had chickens to the point where, where they couldn't even move in the cage.  There were so many chickens in one cage that they couldn't even move.  They could move.  And their feathers have fallen out.  And she just dumped the food on top of them.  Yeah, she dumped the food on top of the chickens.  And one chicken's eating the food off the other.  Chicken?  Chicken?  Chicken.  Chicken.  It's a funny word when you say it enough.  It turns funny.  We're going to have, what's her name on today, right?  To talk about this?  Yeah.  Robin Zazio? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, I want to talk to her about this fucking cunt.  That's part of this show?  No, we like her.  No, I'm not talking about her.  Yeah, she knew how to play.  She ended up being really cool.  Hannah.  Hannah's cotton picking.  Go get in.  You know you're not.  Do we have a video of her?  Hannah's daughter, Linda, talks about her mom and her chickens.  So here's the daughter's involvement in the whole thing.  I'm Linda, and I'm Hannah's daughter.  Hi.  Mom's been living in the single wide for about two years now with chickens. 
[00:56:30]  The single wide.  Mom's got about 50 heads of baby chickens and half-grown chickens in the tubs.  That's what was happening last night, and she was like, do you think that?  Well, they're killing you.  She's got chick manure all over.  Chick manure.  Garbage all over.  It is bad.  He's got that on his chest.  Mom does not have heat in the single wide.  She doesn't have anything to cook on but a hot plate.  Good. 
[00:57:00]  Mom can't even get to her kitchen sink.  Enabling shithead.  Well, she did it to her.  Look at this.  Get the fuck out of here.  Look at this slob.  She's not a good housekeeper.  That bitch must stink.  What are you supposed to do with someone like that?  What you ought to do is just lock the trailer from the outside and get a match.  This problem will be over.  Yes.  Troubles here will be over very quickly.  Very quickly.  Just burn her alive.  To a pile of inoculated chicken beets.  Her home became so full she was forced to move into the fucking trailer. 
[00:57:30]  So she moved into the trailer, and this trailer is just a piece of shit.  And then she gets the trailer full of cats and chickens, and she doesn't eat the chickens  or collect eggs or anything.  She just has them to hoard them.  Look at how cruel that is that they're just stuffed in there.  Yeah.  What a fucking pig.  This selfish, fat fucking pig.  And it's like, oh, their one's dead, and she pulls the dead one out.  Yeah, she's just a selfish pig.  Where does she put the dead ones?  She kept them up. 
[00:58:00]  What do you mean?  In the Tupperware.  Where?  Yeah, they're like right next to the live ones.  Oh, that's good.  Look at this.  So the live ones behave?  She's got rooms full.  Thank you.  She's got rooms full of shit.  And look at her cooking.  And now she's eating on a spackle bucket.  Look at this disgusting slob.  God, does she infuriate me.  She has to cook on her hot plate because there's no electricity in the single one.  Yeah, no electricity.  Well, Hannah's daughters say they were abused.  That's great.  They're all in the okay shape as far as I know. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, my Pluto.  If there's any of them, there's something wrong with them.  It's more than I know about.  There's a couple goats that can't even walk at all.  Every time the goat took a step, it would lift its leg up because it was in pain.  I couldn't believe it.  Tim!  She treats those animals the way she treated us kids.  You listen to me.  You quit fighting them others.  You hear me?  I spank. 
[00:59:00]  And I can't stand that.  We were abused many different ways.  There was many times that...  Did she make you perform cunnilingus on her?  Because we're cold.  I was 16 years old when the state of Illinois removed us.  I only tolerate her because she is my mother.  I'm bad.  I don't have to punish her.  God will. 
[00:59:30]  God will.  I had 16 kids and 10 of them are still living.  If they don't want to have nothing to do with me, fine.  They do fine.  I can live before they was born and I'll live till I die.  Yeah, she's just a piece of garbage.  I had 16 kids, 10 of them lived.  She's like, hey, give me a pound on my fat back.  But again, anybody...  All they should do is just take her animals and then leave her there to die.  She has no redeeming value as a person.  Take her animals away because she's just fucking abusing them. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  And let her die.  Let her die alone.  The lonely old fucking piece of shit she is.  But she'll never feel lonely.  That never works out that way.  She will if you take away her stupid animal.  Oh, well, then you're talking...  Make her live in a pristine environment is the way to go.  Yeah.  Just lock her.  Because the lonely thing, she don't give a shit.  She likes living that way.  Miserable bitch.  I don't know if we want to go through all the clips, but I got Hannah's...  The doctor walks in the trailer?  Yeah.  I want to hear her starting to yell because she starts yelling at people. 
[01:00:30]  Do we need the doctor clip?  I don't know.  I don't remember that one.  I think, yeah, it shows what an obnoxious, uncooperative bitch she is.  Be careful because you'll step...  You'll fall through the floor there.  Okay.  When I walked in the trailer, I was almost speechless.  The condition was so bad in this trailer.  There's chickens all in these containers. 
[01:01:00]  The air quality was overwhelming.  That's manure.  That's manure.  It's up this high.  Yes, that's manure.  It's all in this house.  Nothing works in this place.  I mean, this isn't fit for anything to live in.  No.  Okay, Linda, is she hoarding dead animals?  Why is she not even throwing the animals away?  This is the second time I've seen one dead.  I've seen one dead outside.  No one is going to make it through the winter in here. 
[01:01:30]  There's no way.  I told her that.  And she says, well, I'll just have to put an electric heater in here.  And it's going to go up in flames.  Exactly.  That's what I told her.  I wish.  Anna's children were taken away from her.  And they've been gone for several years now.  And so they're watching her deterioration from afar.  Why do they care if she deteriorates?  Again, she has no redeeming value whatsoever.  Because they're enabling shitheads themselves.  At one point, animal control comes to the house. 
[01:02:00]  Like, unexpected.  Even from the hoarders show, people.  Animal control just shows up to start taking fucking animals away.  And the daughter, one of the daughters comes running up and yelling at everybody that they shouldn't be doing this to my mama.  I came from work.  I had to come here because my mama is being abused.  Shut up.  Look at her.  She's a waste of life. 
[01:02:30]  Hate her.  They got any yelling clips?  Yeah, we're heading into that.  Yeah, I want to hear a yelling.  Poor deer.  Poor deer.  They start to clean up and find a flattened chicken.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  We have got a lot of work to do today.  My name is Matt Paxton.  I'm an extreme...  You watch hoarders every week.  None of these people actually give a fuck, right?  They just want to be on TV.  Yeah, that's kind of what I'm saying.  And this Matt guy, he doesn't take any guff.  He's what they call a straight shooter.  Good. 
[01:03:00]  The way he says his name every time just annoys the shit out of me.  I'm Matt Paxton.  I'm Matt Paxton.  And the second someone starts giving him shit, he just turns around and goes, hey, we're  here to help you.  Right.  No.  Like, he's the...  But we're here to make good TV, is what he's really saying.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  They do good shrink, bad shrink.  That's pretty much it.  Nice.  And he's bad shrink.  What a great show.  I hope this goes on for you.  Oh, God, yeah.  The refrigerator is disgusting.  My name is Matt Paxton.  I'm an extreme cleaning specialist.  If we don't know already, Hannah is in charge. 
[01:03:30]  Okay?  And nothing gets thrown into the dump trucks unless I tell them to you.  Loud and clear.  This is our aunt.  I love how they give...  She's empowered.  Yeah, I love how they give the hoarder some empowerment.  Yeah, they try to empower them.  Hannah, don't worry.  You're in charge here.  Now you...  Ultimately, you're in charge.  Right.  You're going to tell them what to throw away.  I would fucking tie her to a chair as they empty the house.  Oh, just let her scream and cry as you throw away all her precious pieces of shit.  And whip her legs with something.  Oh, fantastic.  I would have no problem doing that to my own mother. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, just fucking...  Wouldn't it be great to just tie this woman up and beat her...  Just tie her to a chair.  ...a segment of barbed wire?  See, then why can't we have our own TV show?  Oh, God, I hate this one.  Bullhorn screaming their fucking faces how awful they are.  Right, right.  Oh, God.  You're a waste of life.  We're throwing away everything.  We're taking your chickens, you fat mess, with your bludo arms.  You fucking pig.  You're a fucking pig.  Hit her with the barbed wire again. 
[01:04:30]  This whipper with barbed wire segments.  Why do I...  But I react the same way.  It's like, why the anger?  I don't know why I get angry either.  I am so angry.  Dude, it ruins my day.  Yes.  Doesn't it?  It's on it.  I want her smothered.  I want to be able to watch these shows, but I just can't.  The me, me, me thing.  Does she annoy you?  Yeah.  Oh, this me, me, me on this one is exquisite.  Well, let's hear the poor dear.  I haven't heard of me, me, me, me yet.  Because I don't give a fuck about her.  I care what it does to everybody around her. 
[01:05:00]  And she has no fucking clue.  Debilitating.  That's what drives me insane with these shows.  She's terrible.  But then the kids have to wake up one day and break the chains.  Ah, break the chains.  Break the cycle.  The cycle.  No, the kids will be just as fucked up.  Well, because they're not willing to break the cycle.  No, they're too fucking...  Gotta talk about your issues and then go, you know what, I'm gonna do something different.  I'm gonna keep my house tidy.  They're out of it.  Yeah, no hope for the kids, too, in this situation.  Unclear. 
[01:05:30]  This is our animal safety team.  Well, I imagine I've worked with last cycle before humans was ever born.  Hannah is very comfortable with who she is.  You know...  I think she's been a fighter all of her life.  I'm a fighter.  We are not gonna change Hannah.  Oh, we're not gonna change who she is.  All right.  Everybody ready to go?  Ready.  That is all feces.  This is a dead chicken that was underneath about a foot of feces.  Is that right?  It got crushed under the weight of the feces.  And it was in a cage, so it couldn't get out. 
[01:06:00]  That's wonderful.  Yeah, a foot of shit.  She's torturing animals, this fucking slob.  Yeah, she's torturing fucking animals.  And she's like...  And they told her,  look, we have livestock professionals here  that'll assess the animals and see...  I've been around livestock before you was born!  Like that obnoxious, like,  oh, you know everything?  You fucking dumb, 60 IQ,  profoundly retarded hillbilly fuck. 
[01:06:30]  I hate this woman!  We still don't have the clip of her yelling and screaming, though.  Oh, well, I better get it.  Let me hear it.  You heard about this, too,  just to do a little off-roading?  Yeah.  That the fan frenzy caused a small earthquake  at the Seattle Seahawks game over the weekend?  Have you heard about this yet?  Really?  What, from jumping around?  Jumping and screaming so much  that it actually registered.  It registered?  As a tinier earthquake.  Oh.  That's pretty unbelievable, isn't it?  What is there, one of those seismographs 
[01:07:00]  right there in the middle of the field?  What the fuck are they doing?  Or maybe it was a real earthquake.  Yeah, it could have been a real earthquake.  It was just a coincidence.  Bunch of assholes with umbrellas leaping around  because you're going to move the planet.  Bunch of people yelling, yay.  Yay.  Yay, my team.  They start examining the animals, Anthony.  Back to Hannah, the border.  She got her foot in an old piece of fencing.  How long ago did that happen?  Last fall.  Last fall. 
[01:07:30]  Is she pregnant?  Yeah.  She's pregnant.  She's pregnant to have a baby next month.  This duck can't even stretch his legs.  We've watched him.  All he can do is kind of scooch on this wire.  Her feet are not intended to be on a wire.  You get chronic injury and inflammation.  The ducks need to have access to water  so that they can swim.  No, I don't want them in no water this week.  I don't want them laying their eggs in water  before I can't get them to sit.  Do you have a pond where the ducks can get to? 
[01:08:00]  No, I don't want them in that pond.  That would be great.  You put them in that pond?  Goodbye.  I know what she is required to provide for these animals  and she's not providing it.  We really need to do our own hoarder show  and teach this one a lesson  and put her in a room  where it's only like three feet  between the floor and the ceiling.  And have her live like that for a weekend  and go, this is how your chickens are living.  And your ducks.  Have her barefoot on wire 
[01:08:30]  where she's got to stand on wire mesh  with barefoot.  The duck.  Ducks need fucking water.  They're ducks.  But she lives in a trailer  filled with chicken shit.  Yeah, that's true.  She's nuts.  She would love the cage.  She would love it.  But she can still move around  so you got to make it, you know,  you got to get it to the point  where she's like, okay, I get it.  With a big dumb walker.  Instead they coddle her on this show.  I know.  That's what drives me nuts.  Wouldn't you like her to be,  I was thinking how fun it'd be  if she's standing there  an old fat piggy lady 
[01:09:00]  just to push her and tip her over  and her walk her.  Oh, a walker just blindside her.  Just dive right into her  and make her fall over.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  You hate her?  I hate this woman.  I have a deep hatred for this woman.  Michi Kaku's checking in.  Thank God.  Wow.  Michi Kaku.  Yes, hello.  How are you today, gentlemen?  Good.  We're going over Hannah the Hoarder here.  Well, you must understand  that the mind of a hoarder  is like a reaver of garbage. 
[01:09:30]  The only way to remove the problem  is to burn the bitch alive  in the house.  Ah!  Well, thank you for that insight,  Dr. Kaku.  How wonderful.  It's wonderful every time  you call our show.  Thank you.  Her trailer is filled  with chicken kaku.  Get it?  Get it?  Doody.  He's laughing.  He's laughing.  He gets it.  He gets it.  Hannah refuses to make room  for the goats.  What's up with the goats? 
[01:10:00]  Ah, there's a barn-type area  that they're in right here  in this picture.  It looks roomy enough.  And, ah, well,  it's roomy enough  if you remove some of these cages,  these rusty cages,  rusty cages,  that is all over the place.  Q Soundgarden, let's go.  They're all over the place.  And, ah,  this fucking fat slob  is not letting them  clear this out  so the chickens  can have an open space.  And who's the guy  in the background  looking at the screen?  That's the shrink  that doesn't take any nonsense.  He's taking nonsense, though. 
[01:10:30]  No, he doesn't take much nonsense.  He's taking nonsense.  A little nonsense.  He's kind of faking  that he's not taking nonsense.  But I think he's taking some nonsense.  A little nonsense.  A little nonsense.  A little bit.  I don't know the show like you,  but just how he's standing there,  I see he's taking a little nonsense.  He's got his hands on his hips.  When was the last time  you stood with your hands  on your hips?  He's leaning on a shit-filled  fucking cage.  Okay.  He's trying to keep his hands  anywhere but on  the shit-filled cage.  Hips probably safe.  He doesn't listen to her crap. 
[01:11:00]  Seriously,  when was the last time  you just stood somewhere  with your hands on your hips?  Exactly.  Right before I took a step  to the right.  Jesus Christ.  I'd like you to do  the hokey pokey  with a bunch of fucking  cut-off clits in the sedan.  You put your husband's  right arm in.  You put your afro out.  You run in a circle  and it still doesn't rain. 
[01:11:30]  Okay, the goats.  Making room for the goats.  I need to get more space  for these goats.  And this is a great opportunity.  It's enough space  for them for now.  I'll get the rest of it  done to myself  later on.  We got a bunch of guys  with a bunch of trucks  that are free.  That's why I want to...  There ain't nothing  going out of here.  I'm telling you  half of this is...  I don't care what  you're telling me.  I'm telling you.  I own it.  You don't.  Correct.  She's arousing.  She just lets you know  that you're bugging her.  She makes a lot of noise 
[01:12:00]  and tries to get you  to go away.  I'd like to get this out of here.  It's going to stay  right where it is.  Okay, so we want to get...  The goal was to give  your goats more space.  You're saying this is  not the way to do it.  No, that's not to say so.  What about if we just  reshuffled it to here?  No, I said it stays there.  How many times  did I have to tell you that?  It's difficult to do  a hoarding cleanup  when the hoarder  doesn't want to touch anything.  Mom!  I'm going to go.  Oh, f***.  What a piece of  fucking shit.  I can't listen anymore.  Can you... 
[01:12:30]  Look, she's upset, guys.  Yeah, I mean...  He's in a corner  in the field position.  This is the shit  that drives me nuts  about people.  You're affecting  everyone around you!  Do you see that?  And I can't stand  the coddling.  No!  You hear it.  No!  I told you it's mine!  I'm sure there's rules.  It's A&E  and they got to do it...  You know,  they got to be careful  how they do this.  Punch her in the face.  Or she'll boot the crew out  and he'll be able to film.  Yeah, that's probably  like walking the fine line  between wanting to  belt her in the face 
[01:13:00]  and doing a show.  Yeah, but she's obviously  having a tough day.  I mean, tough time.  She's trying.  No, she's not.  Jimmy,  she said nothing's  going on out of there.  Have you been listening?  It is her place.  She bought it.  Not him.  Are they getting  like new episodes  together for next season?  Oh, I would assume.  Yeah, this is a hit.  Can we do a hoarding  episode on  Club Soda Kenny  and his hoarding of condiments?  Condiment hoarding.  Could someone drag  the drawer of condiments  in here, please? 
[01:13:30]  Or could someone  do a quick count  of what we're up to?  Kenny, how many condiments  do you really need?  I need them all.  Is it as bad  as the old place?  I haven't seen it.  See, just like  a hoarder situation,  we were able to get rid  of all the hoarding  of the condiments  that Kenny was doing,  but he's had enough time  to now get a new collection.  He rebuilt it.  Where's the collection  of condiments?  I like chicken shit.  Could someone  count up the condiments?  Sam's going to bring it in.  Sam's going to bring it in?  Okay, good.  Because I think  when Dr. Robin calls, 
[01:14:00]  I think we got  an episode for her.  Club Soda Candy  and the condiments.  She should have  checked it out.  Yeah.  Oh, that's not a bad...  Fuck, we weren't thinking.  Hannah won't let  them fix the animals.  What do you mean  by fix the animals?  Literally, yeah.  Make sure they're okay.  Or fix meaning  they can't have babies anymore?  No, no.  I don't think that...  It's well beyond that.  I think they want  to take them away.  They want to take them away  and give them  some veterinary care.  Yeah, the issue  is that they can't... 
[01:14:30]  Since these people  that they called in  are from out of state,  they can't take  any animals away  from her  unless she lets them.  Is it cruel  to say that  I don't really care  because it's chickens  and goats?  Right, right.  I can really...  If it was cats,  if it was dogs...  It would be worse.  But she's actually  making me care  about chickens.  But she's making me  care about chickens.  We don't have chickens  and goats as pets  and we didn't grow up  with friends  who had them as pets.  Well, you don't!  I do!  I do!  You got her voice down.  Oh, that's so fucking angry. 
[01:15:00]  Everything is just angering.  There are animals  on this property  that are suffering  and we can't allow them  to continue to suffer like that.  Well, I'll tell you one thing.  When you start out messing with,  I'll sue every damn one of you.  You know, Hannah?  That's what you're right.  Now, by God,  there's no damn sense  of you getting out here  sticking your damn nose  in my business.  It's none of your business.  But we were called here  and we were called here  for a reason, Hannah,  and that was to make  your life better, right?  Yes, and taking my animal  sure so I won't make it better.  Okay, but it also,  we need to make  the animal's life better as well. 
[01:15:30]  I have been battling  this damn bullsh**  for years.  Somebody else  got their damn nose stuck  when they got no business.  Ugh.  Yeah, and that trailer.  Mm.  With my nose in there.  You stinky old bitch.  God, she's got a smell.  Yeah.  Her asshole's not clean.  Oh, God.  That's it?  That's it.  Oh, wow.  Kenny's been cured?  Kenny's cured.  Kenny's cured  because Sam walked in  with the condiments.  It used to be a whole  fucking drawer filled.  Yeah, my thought is probably 
[01:16:00]  that it was cleared out  before the end of the year.  Who did that?  And so this is probably  just the 2011.  They're my condiments!  Cool.  There's really not much in there.  No, there's going to be  less than a better thing.  Oh, no!  That's going to drive Kenny nuts.  Oh, he's going to say.  Oh, boy.  Kenny's not going to be happy.  Jimmy just threw away  what was left of Kenny's condiments.  Don't tell Kenny.  Let him find out on his own.  How funny would it be  if he came in  and broke my neck?  Hysterical.  Not for me, but...  Hannah freaks out 
[01:16:30]  over the animals.  This is finally...  Finally, we're an hour  into the clips, Anne,  and you get what you want.  The screaming and...  The yelling.  ...carrying on.  Okay.  That's a fucking damn...  Hannah, these people  are ready to come in  and take all your animals.  Right.  I don't...  That's all the...  They're thinking about you.  You're going to take  somebody back there.  And I'm trying to prevent it.  You've got some  that you can't care for.  I can care for them  if I had some.  Hannah, we are on your team.  Will you shut up  when I'm talking to her?  I can manage them  just fine, all of them.  Let me tell you  what we can do for you, Hannah, okay? 
[01:17:00]  Let me give you an option.  Okay.  Knowing that an option,  you might tell me  what you can do,  but it's not an option.  But I'm asking you  to let us do this.  We got to deal with this.  Can you let Robin  take the sick ones  so you can keep the rest of it?  Yeah, but you take the...  I ain't got nothing.  I'm not...  I don't give a damn.  You take the ones  you're calling sick  and I've got nothing left.  And Hannah...  I mean, let me tell you.  I don't want to do that.  Okay.  She gave you an out,  you assholes!  What? 
[01:17:30]  Didn't she give him an out?  Yeah, she did.  And she goes,  we don't want to do that.  Just tell her  that's what we're going to do.  Yeah, we're taking  these fucking poor,  suffering animals  away from you,  you fucking witch bitch.  Yeah, why didn't they  just let Animal Control...  Oh, look at her,  this fucking fat sow.  And who's that?  Her daughter's lump?  Yeah, the daughter.  Patting her fat arm,  she was a neglectful mother.  Don't fucking...  Don't give her  any comfort.  She deserves no comfort.  She deserves to die alone. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Let her cry on the ground  by herself.  That's when you walk away.  Yeah, walk away.  Guess what?  She'll change.  I don't want to do that.  Hannah has extremely  poor judgment and insight.  And she can't make  any healthy decisions.  This is the solution.  Oh, yeah,  that's the solution for you,  but it's not for me.  Oh, God.  The team decides  to leave Hannah alone  to cool down.  At the same time,  her daughter Becky  bursts onto the scene. 
[01:18:30]  Becky is a cunt on wheels.  Of course she is.  Oh, boy.  Whose side is she on?  The mother's.  What?  I thought...  Oh, no,  she's on the mother's side.  Uh-oh.  Hopefully Becky  is raped for her.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Don't stop with me.  Don't stop with me.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  No.  You guys were supposed  to come up here  and help her.  We are helping.  I'm not supposed  to get phone calls  while I'm at work.  Calm down.  And she's upset.  Calm down.  You know she's  going to f*** her.  No.  Calm down.  My mother is nobody's  going to start  with her.  Who started  with her? 
[01:19:00]  Calm down.  One of the grandchildren  was apparently calling  Hannah's daughter  and saying things  that weren't even happening.  I get phone calls  while I'm at work.  Okay, calm down.  Calm down.  Who's calling?  I don't know who you are.  Everybody's calling me here.  I'm not going to deal  with my mother getting upset  and having a heart attack.  Jesus.  No, that's not what I got.  Calm down.  Give her f***.  Time out.  Bart.  Bart, please go that way.  I need to see my mother.  She's right here.  We're going to do something.  No one's on. 
[01:19:30]  Robin and I were able to stop her,  but she still ended up  getting in a fight  with her brother.  Everything we're going to find  is all our f***ing children.  Bart.  Shut your f***ing mouth, Bart.  Please.  Get over here.  Hey, what's up, Bart?  Don't do it, Bart.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  She'll knock the hell out of him  and flatten him out.  Hit her, Bart.  These children that she has raised  don't have ability to communicate  without yelling.  This isn't helping.  This family is probably 
[01:20:00]  the largest family I've ever seen.  And it is by far  the most dysfunctional family  I have ever seen.  They were all fat kooks.  Bart, was it?  Bart.  Yeah, that's because  Bart does crystal meth every day.  Yeah, exactly.  And just smokes cigarettes.  He looks like he plays  in a southern rock band, Bart.  Yeah, Bart looks like  from fucking Leonard Skinner.  He sure does, man.  He looks like David Spade.  Fucking Bart dirt.  Does he have a shirt  with an eagle on it?  Yeah, he has a shirt  with a big eagle on it. 
[01:20:30]  It's terrible.  He's got a cigarette in his mouth.  He's yelling at his sister.  It's not even lit.  No, it's not lit.  He's trying to light it,  but he's yelling too much.  He probably has a suit  with a Ford truck  on the back of it.  The decal.  Bart rules.  With the thing  with the little guy  that pisses on the Chevy logo.  Yeah.  Oh, he's got a rude boy hat  with his tuxedo.  Bart's a fool.  And he fell out  of a fucking rotten cunt.  That whole fucking family 
[01:21:00]  should be gassed.  Fucking,  we should send  Jared Loftor  to visit with that whole family.  Exactly.  Jared Loftor,  five minutes  with that fucking family.  Jared Loftor.  Warning signs missed.  We'll get into that  when we answer the break.  Yeah.  Let me write that down.  Warning signs missed.  The fucking media.  They're so stupid.  Yeah.  Hannah still doesn't want to clean.  Boxes got to go out to the barn.  No, they don't  because that is 
[01:21:30]  Steffi Nugget  cannot go in the barn.  Okay.  And I don't give a  what you like it or do.  Okay.  But they're going to the barn.  Take on.  Hey.  Hey.  You want me to send you a  Hey.  Wait, Becky.  No.  Guys.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay.  My mom has lashed out at me  many times.  I'm used to it.  That's what she did  when we were kids.  So,  I just take it.  Kiss my  It's my grits.  Leave my stuff alone  or you can get the hell  out of here now. 
[01:22:00]  Whatever you want to do.  Well, that's where we're at.  We're either going to move it all  or we're leaving.  You got to decide.  Yeah, see?  It's trash.  This family decided  that they were going to do  whatever it takes  to get this house safe  for their mom.  And they've done that.  But the reality is  this house will be full  very quickly.  We have offered  aftercare services  for Hannah.  She does not think  that she has a  compulsive hoarding problem.  Of course she doesn't.  She does not  by any means  see anything wrong 
[01:22:30]  with the treatment  of these animals  and she's refusing  all help at this point.  Hannah's prognosis  is extremely poor.  Probably the worst  of any hoarder  I've ever worked with.  Poor dead, dying chicken.  That was Robin  who's going to be on our show  in about an hour.  The chicken died.  This woman's holding a chicken.  It died right there  in her hands.  Did it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just dies.  Yeah, it was starving.  And stupid fat fuck Hannah. 
[01:23:00]  It's like,  what a disgusting selfish slob.  She is valueless.  Yes.  As a person.  I don't care that she's crazy.  I don't care that she's hurt.  She literally  should be left  to die alone  in her own shit.  Or basically  they should let  animal control  take every animal  out of there  and then you get a judge  and if she's found  with another animal  she's thrown in jail.  Right.  Is that what they did?  I don't think that's what  they should do.  Did they take the animals away yet? 
[01:23:30]  I think they did.  They took some of them away.  Yeah.  But like I said  they couldn't take anything  unless she said okay.  But the other people  took the sick ones.  That doesn't make sense.  Like almost all of them.  Animal control  came unannounced  and they convinced  animal control to leave  like hey  we're going to take care  of the situation.  But they had to have  come back and got rid of  I think in time.  Look at that arm.  Oh there's fat  and just dirt fat.  Oh the animal team  was from out of state  but that's because  that's probably the one  they used for the show. 
[01:24:00]  Right.  But not animal control.  But the local ones  have to be  had to march in there  and do the right thing.  Well that's what I saw too.  When the local ones  showed up  the Hoarders crew  went over and talked to them.  Right.  Now I'm sure they were like  hey look  we're trying to fucking  film the show here.  Let us film our show first  and then come back  with fucking a SWAT team  if you want to  and just like fucking  blow the place up.  Because local animal control  isn't going to be coddling.  They're going to be  move the fuck out of our way.  We have a job to do right now.  You don't have a job to do. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah really.  My chicken.  Then they get the fucking sheriff  and the sheriff handcuffs her  puts her in the back of a car  as animal control  does the right thing  with all these animals.  I want to rip that  fucking fleshy bulb  off of the bottom of her neck.  Look at that thing.  She's turning into  a big fat chicken.  She's obviously a bipolar nut.  Her family is damaged  and destroyed by her.  She should just leave her alone  to die.  That's all you do  with people like that.  Stop trying to save them.  They're so fucked up  that they're enabling her. 
[01:25:00]  Of course they are.  You think her pussy smells?  Oh god what that must be.  Oh god.  What do you think  it smells like?  She does the Humpty Dumpty  sit when she sits  because that big lump of fat  that goes between her legs  so she's got to sit  like Humpty Dumpty.  You mean the gunt?  This guy's like  throw it out.  Throw it out.  Why are they cleaning  this pig's house?  That's the show Jimmy.  See they go to pig's houses  and try to clean it.  Put you this garbage in there.  Think she has bugs?  I bet there's lots of bugs. 
[01:25:30]  Probably a couple.  Well we'll discuss this further  with Robin Zazio  and this should have been  the season finale  but they went with  That should have been.  They went with the pet rats.  Who just  you just felt bad for rat guy.  You weren't that impressed right?  Oh by the way  I saw the other guys.  Oh you did?  Because of you.  What did you think?  I think  I wasn't saying  great movie  I said  there are definitely  laughs in it.  The first 10 or 15 minutes  was Samuel Jackson  in The Rock. 
[01:26:00]  The Rock.  Very good.  Unbelievable.  And Will Ferrell  I have to say  he's really good  in awful movies.  Yeah.  Not saying this was  an awful movie.  There were scenes  that were hilarious.  Yeah.  But I don't even understand  the big crime.  Did you say  they had explained  it during the credits?  Yeah.  They were kind of  explaining the crime  later on.  It was  it was  yeah  because it  it involved  like stocks  and things.  I liked it.  At times I was laughing hard  but in general  I was  it didn't keep my interest. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  I was fading  in and out.  You know what?  I watched another  dumb fucking  mindless comedy  called Sex Drive.  Have you ever seen that?  Sex Drive.  It's a horrible premise.  I never would have  watched this.  It's like  hey  a guy  who's a virgin  finds a girl  on the internet  and has to drive  to go get laid  by this girl  and it's like  oh one of these movies?  Right.  And it was fucking funny.  How many years ago  did that come out?  I don't know  it came out like  a couple years ago?  2008. 
[01:27:00]  Just mindless  bad movies.  Right.  But  I mean I like the other guys.  I mean at one point  at one point  some guys  old guys  sitting there  Seth Green  is in it  but he plays  a sarcastic  Amish guy  that's his  I remember  when this came out.  It's funny as fuck  the sarcastic  Amish guy  is on demand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Alright I'll try  this one next.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Mark Wahlberg  is pretty funny.  Yeah.  Mark Wahlberg  was funny  in the other guys.  And  I like that 
[01:27:30]  Amanda Crew.  Click on that  Amanda Crew.  Where is she from?  I like that.  Sam what are you whispering?  I don't like that.  I'm just whispering.  You have to click  on Amanda Crew.  What's up Sam?  Well Sam can tell you.  I'll click on it.  I don't care.  Sex drive?  I'll get her on my own computer.  You know the guys  from the movie  promoted the movie  on this show.  Did they?  Oh yeah.  Who?  Who?  Definitely  I think it's the guy  Clark Duke.  Amanda Crew wasn't in  was she? 
[01:28:00]  No no.  Wait the guy  was actually in the studio?  Yeah Clark Duke  Wait wait wait  This is back at K-Rock  That guy came into the studio?  Clark Duke came in?  Seth and Seth Green  both came in  to promote this movie.  Really?  Yeah yeah.  And were we laughing  at what a piece of shit it was?  Seth Green came in  to promote  with Clark Duke.  I cannot believe it.  I don't have a memory of this.  Was I out that day?  No you were  You were both here.  Do you remember Jim?  Vaguely.  Jim you were here too.  Yeah and that was  Seth and somebody else.  Wow.  Clark Duke.  Clark Duke.  Who's kind of funny. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  He's also on the show  Greek.  Oh is that right?  Seth Green's gonna be  on the show soon  promoting Green Hornet.  Phone call though right?  Little phone call  from Seth.  Wait Seth Green?  Really?  Oh not Seth Green.  Seth Rogen.  Seth Rogen.  I'm sorry.  Oh wait so  wait Seth Green  the little short motherfucker  with red hair  oh so he's in the sex drive?  Yeah.  With Clark Duke.  I'm so confused now.  Okay Seth Green  was in  was in with that other guy 
[01:29:00]  promoting sex drive.  Clark Duke promoting sex drive.  And we have no recollection.  They were both  they sat on the couch  at K-Rock  across from YouTube.  Really?  For a half an hour.  God we are the worst.  Yep.  I don't think  we're losing our minds.  I think it was just  one of those  forgettable moments.  They were both  talking to you  about the movie.  You're asking him about  oh what's the movie  all about?  Was that the time  Seth had a problem  because we brought up  without a paddle? 
[01:29:30]  No.  I think he was  no the time  you brought up  without a paddle  I think he was in  by himself.  Okay.  Alright.  Well did you like the movie?  You liked it?  There were some funny moments.  It was pretty funny  and I gotta say  Seth Green  as the sarcastic  Amish guy  pretty fucking funny.  They would have been  happy two years ago.  I know!  Two years ago!  It's a two years later  I'm like  you know  motherfucker  I saw it  and I was laughing.  Not only did you  not see the movie  before they came in  but you saw the movie 
[01:30:00]  two and a half years later  and forgot they even  showed up.  They just wasted  their morning.  And I keep confusing  Seth Green  with Seth Rogen.  I gotta admit that.  I do that all  the fucking time.  Huh?  I like Seth Rogen.  Yeah I like Seth Rogen.  I don't dislike Seth Green  and Seth Rogen  will be calling our show  for the Green Hornet.  He is in the Green Hornet.  Yes.  Yeah yeah.  Wow.  Clark Duke is not.  I will give my review  on the Green Hornet  in 2015. 
[01:30:30]  Alright.  The other guys  was alright though.  Yeah yeah.  I'm not  you know  I'm still looking  for that one comedy  to come out  where I'm gonna laugh  the entire fucking movie  like the old days.  Yeah.  You get moments.  Yeah you get moments  these days.  Culliver's Travels  with Jack Black.  I can't wait.  Oh god.  He's funny  because he does  one eyebrow raise thing.  He's like oh  this guy's pretty cool.  And he'll put on  the face like  huh?  Huh?  Right?  He's a madman. 
[01:31:00]  He's crazy.  He's a madman.  Oh is he funny?  Is he?  No.  Is he funny?  I don't like him  because he's never  had a courteous moment  with me  so fuck him.  He's another guy  that we  I don't want to say  helped  because that's  kind of pompous  but we were there  when no one  really knew  who he was  and then he got big  and then started  blowing us off  and then he would  only come in  to promote  that band thing.  Tenacious D.  That was horse shit.  I didn't like them either.  Tenacious D was good 
[01:31:30]  at first absolutely  then it just  went south quickly  and that was  the only time  he would only  come in  to promote  that crap.  I hate his  dumb wacky face.  I did radio  with him  two times here  and I see him  on the Leno show  one time  and he's just like  I didn't say hi  to him either  but I was like  what a cunt.  Fuck you.  You're a wacky face.  Belushi didn't overdose  you'd be fucking  you'd be fucking  shoveling snow somewhere.  Thank God  Belushi  and Candy  and fucking 
[01:32:00]  Farley are dead.  I don't hate him  I don't know why  I'm being this  I'm just tired.  TJ's in another movie?  I don't know.  Is it Gulliver's Travels now?  Oh God.  How does it get worse?  Where's the eyebrows  going up?  TJ Miller.  There they are.  He's expressive.  TJ Miller  became a friend of ours  he did Cloverfield  he was the  he was the camera guy  in the movie  and he came in  and he turned out  to be a pretty cool guy  and he does stand up  in New York City  when he's not  doing movie  after movie  after movie now. 
[01:32:30]  He's got a tiny part  in every giant movie.  He was in  Get Me to the Greek  Yeah.  He was in  Help Me Out  He was in  He had his own movie  Yogi Bear  He had that movie  and then he's now  going to be in  Gulliver's Travel  He played like a  movie with  a nerd in it.

Yeah, a very funny improv  Improv with Star Wars  action figures  Yeah, that's  But then you know  the joke is there 
[01:34:00]  Yeah  Because in lieu of a laugh  which is what happens  after a joke  when comics do it  You hear  the drums play  That's always a good sign  Boy, that must be fun  to write comedy  Can you rewind that?  I want to hear  the laugh drums  No, that's great  The laugh drums  That's what we're going  to be bringing  on the road with this  Just some fucking  Ringo Starr  to sit there  and fucking  and bang out  a fucking couple  of shots  Are you trying to say  that post-production  has to pump up  some things  to where the laugh  should be?  No, no, no  I mean, there was  big laughs for this  but the drums 
[01:34:30]  overrode them  Here's where the  big laugh comes  Oh, he's my brother  Then you shouldn't  have made out with him  What do you hope  to get  out of being  in the mailroom?  I hope to get  out of being  in the mailroom  You're hired  How long have you  had this crush  on the travel editor?  On Darcy?  No way, dude  How's your day going?

[01:36:30]  Done  Okay  Where's the clutch?  That's funny  He doesn't have to use it  Comedy genre  That's in a big storm  I'd seen  Show him a whole movie  which is great  That's the perfect storm  That was the perfect storm  Uh oh  That's what it looked like  Thank God  That was his eye opening  There you go  He's tied down now  By the little people  The little  little fusion  They've tied him down  This Christmas  Oh they're wheeling him 
[01:37:00]  into some kind of city  He ruined King Kong  Now he'll ruin this one too  I wanted a bracelet  Not a great big hairy beast  What?  You found it  With your vest  Don't shave up my sideburns  I need those mutton chops  What is that?  And now he's  Real people  Running around like a wild man 
[01:37:30]  Yelling gold  Does that make a lot of money?  Can we see?  Oh my God  Yeah  If it made more than  A dollar seventy five  I hate this country  There was not  One  Funny  I was trying  Moment  I was definitely trying  What was the one  He just did  Before the  Before he ran around  A wild guy  That's how guys are  We run around a lot  Yeah  We're idiots  Oh there's a pretty girl  We don't know how to act 
[01:38:00]  Here come the numbers  Go ahead Travis  It's made thirty four million  Nice  In three weeks  Nice  But the budget  Was one hundred and twelve million  Oh no  Someone's gonna take  A little bit of a bath  Yeah  I'll make it back on the DVDs  Yeah  That's what I like to say  On the back end  Three D  That's a terrible take  It's number twelve  After three weeks  That's not good  That's pretty good  No it's not  It could come back up though  Right  Probably not  No it won't 
[01:38:30]  What do you mean  That happens sometimes  If every other movie  Goes away  Then  I mean if they stop  Putting movies in theaters  Completely  Yeah yeah  Like if then it would  Except for this one  And the little fuckers  And like Tron  Legacy and stuff  Black Swan  If all that goes away  He'll move up a couple of notches  Well little fuckers  Has brought in  Language  Little fuckers  It's talkers  We don't play their stupid game  I told you that already  It's only brought in about  Ninety million dollars  More than Gulliver's Travels  Which disgusts me also 
[01:39:00]  So Gulliver's Travels  Is in almost  Three thousand theaters  And the King's Speech  Is in 758  And it made  Two million dollars more  Than Gulliver's  The King's Speech  I heard that was good  I saw Chris Russo  Was going to see it  Who?  In his dumb overcoat  In his fucking  Slacks  The King's Speech  Yeah hey  I want to say this to Russo  That looked so dull  Stop  Stop fucking dressing  Like you're on a mission  Of intrigue  You're not  On a mission  Of intrigue  You talk about  Balls going in hoops 
[01:39:30]  Manically  And you fucking  Shake hands  Like the fucking  That horrible  Carnac magician  What was that  Dickhead Kreskin  Kreskin  He hurts your hand  Stop  A mission  What is he on  He thinks he's on  He dresses like  He's on a mission  Of intrigue  You're not dark man  A mission of intrigue  You're a creepy guy  With great hair  And he's got to  Pull his pants down  A little bit  He's hair like  Chuck Scarborough  I'm sick of him  His pants are way  Too fucking high  A mission of intrigue 
[01:40:00]  Yeah  He pulls his pants  Up so high  You see ball bag  Really?  Yeah he's one  Of those guys  Holy shit  That's funny  God damn  I bet he hears music  When he walks  Like he's on a mission  Yeah  Don't see a mediocre movie  You hear him coming  All the time  They're about  Sitting in my office  He came in  What a set of games  Can we try to get  I drank my whiskey  I'm Bond  James Bond  Mission of intrigue  I'm going to see a movie  Hi Jim 
[01:40:30]  Shake my hand  Ow  He's always  I always feel like  When he's talking to me  He always just wants  To be away  Oh yeah  Really?  Always  He has polite banter  On his way  To anywhere else  He's very manic  But I think then  He gets to that other place  And he's doing  The exact same thing  Yeah  It's not about you  He just doesn't know  How to relax  His hands bend a lot  Yeah  That's how you know  He's nuts  Because his hands bend out  They're so tense  They bend out  He can't even clap  Comfortly 
[01:41:00]  Stiff  Awful hands  We gotta get him  On the air though  To talk football  We got some playoff games  To talk about  He does know a lot  About football  I'm just tired  Of his overcoat  I didn't see  His rain retardant  Overcoat  It's the executive  95  The King's Speech  Is getting on  Rotten Tomatoes  A lot of Oscar buzz  Around the King's Speech  Ah the Social Network 
[01:41:30]  Is gonna win everything  Let's relax everybody  No  True Grit's got  Ah the Social Network  Let's make some bets  Right now  Social Network  It's got a lot of competition  The King's Speech  And True Grit  And the King's Speech  What he had a speech impediment  They had to teach him  To talk properly  That's right  Is that what the fuck  That's about  And all the girls  Like Colin Firth  He's in it  You haven't seen this  I seen the trailer  I couldn't tell  What the fuck was happening  Get the preview  Oh look at this  21 positive reviews  For Gulliver's Travels  And even the audience 
[01:42:00]  Saying skip it  40%  So much worse  So go to the trailer  For the King's Speech  You gotta hear how  This dummy talks  What's an actor  What  I've seen this trailer  10 times  And I just keep going  Ah I never see this  Cause I didn't know  What it was about  I thought Roland was coming in  Cause he knows about movies  Yeah yeah  He walked right by the studio  Oh  I'm busy  Not busy  Doing things  GWC feels 
[01:42:30]  My husband is  But he's required  To speak publicly  As soon as they start  Talking like that  I have no desire  I have a seat  Big A  Perhaps he should change jobs  Big A's speech  I wanted my husband  With a king  Was a king  My husband  Has seen everyone  Insert them into your mouth  For all the  Enunciate  He hasn't seen me  I can kill your husband 
[01:43:00]  But I need total trust  I'm bailing  I actually would like to see that  Cause it's true  I'm bailing  I could give a shit  That this guy can't speak properly  He stutters  And I'm gonna watch an entire movie  Of them fixing his speech  He's the king  So he can speak  He has to lead a country  Roland  I saw it twice  You know you didn't see it twice  I did  While you fell asleep  The first time  What happened  It was a really good movie though  No  It wasn't  Colin Firth will win the Oscar  I think for actor  Why  He's how you fix his speech  I'm gonna get 
[01:43:30]  I'm gonna fucking slap  Whack him in the head  And know why he's gonna win the Oscar  Cause he's playing a dummy  They love when you play a dummy  Like Robert Downey  Not full retard  Not full retard  He didn't go full retard  But social network  Will win the rest  I haven't seen that  I had it here yesterday  What did you think of True Grit?  I haven't seen that yet  I've seen it  Oh okay  Well then you're  You're tossing out a movie  That has Oscar buzz  What about Gulliver's Travels?  No I wouldn't see that 
[01:44:00]  What has that guy been in right there?  That's Jeffrey  Rush  Remember the  Oscar winner right?  That piano guy  He's the piano guy?  Or his big movie  He won Oscar for  Who?  Jeffrey Rush  What else was he in?  Jeffrey Rush was fucking  Not a Beautiful Mind  But the other one  He was in Jaws  Got it  He won an Oscar for  Hold on  Jeffrey Rush  Well he looks familiar  Like I've seen him in something  You know the guy  As soon as you hear the movie  He fucking won an Oscar  He was in Parks and the Caribbean  But he won an Oscar for one of his first 
[01:44:30]  I know  Oh Pirates of the Caribbean  Oh he was the fucking  No but he won an Oscar  A couple years before that  What's the first word of it?  He was that guy  He made a word of it  I'm so annoyed  The  Oh Shine  Shine  Yeah  Oh I wouldn't remember that  That was a pretty good movie  Hey something about the social network  While we have Roland here  For the people that saw the social network  You haven't seen the social network yet?  No I haven't  There's twins in this movie right?  What?  And Roland tells me that's one guy  Yeah  I'm like well how the fuck is that?  Possible  Did they CGI that shit? 
[01:45:00]  They CGI the other actor  Into the other guy's face  In the act  Oh really?  Yeah  Why wouldn't they just get twins?  Get the Olsen twins  Because twins are hard to find good actors  Yeah?  What about the Olsen twins?  And the twins  They're boys  And how the story goes  The twins invented Facebook technically  And that's what the whole movie's about  The Volumical twins  Thanks for the spoiler  Then the other fucking guy said no  I invented it  And then they had a huge fucking lawsuit  Right?  Yeah  That's what the movie's about  So I'm going wow 
[01:45:30]  They got twins to play this perfectly  And they're rowing  They become  They rowed in the Olympics  That's crazy  But in the movie  They're rowing next to each other  And it's one guy  And they meddle too  Alright that's Oscar worthy right there  But that's a technical Oscar  No one cares about those  Best actor  He's not going to get it  Playing two guys  When was the last time that happened?  Although the main guy  In the social network  You think he has a shot at the Oscar?  Two guys ever win?  No  It's a thrilling double role  Ever win an Oscar?  Multiplicity  Multiplicity  Did that ever win an Oscar? 
[01:46:00]  That was a great piece of shit  Good Spock bad Spock  Good Kirk bad Kirk  My mother described true grit  As a tour de force  I thought you were going to say  He's being fucked on the beach  That was good Jimmy  I feel bad I said that though  No it was funny  It was just a timing joke  A tour de force  Now what does that mean?  I don't know  But I got a text from her 
[01:46:30]  That said  Me and dad just saw true grit  Phenomenal  A tour de force  That means it's covered a lot  It was expansive  It was grandiose  Is that what she was saying?  It was just amazing on all ends  It hit the spectrum  She  I think she just reads movie reviews  And uses words  Yeah yeah yeah  And uses like lines from movie reviews  Tour de force  An exceptional achievement  By an artist, author  Or the like  That's what she meant 
[01:47:00]  That's unlike to be equaled  By that person or anyone else  Stroke of genius  Alright  Herman Melvin's Moby Dick  Was a tour de force  But the Coen brothers have done so much  I wouldn't describe this  Well they've done some tour de forces before  They sure have  They have so many tour de forces  Tour de forces  They're a tour de force to be reckoned with  Let's start our Oscar talk real fast  Best movie Roland  I think they can give it to Social Network 
[01:47:30]  Uh best actor Roland  Uh Colin Firth  Best actress  Mmm  That's definitely  Why?  Why?  I'm not sure though  What about the girl from True Grit?  Yeah  She was good  The one to play with the little kid  Yeah they're going to Jodie Foster  No  They'll probably give it to her  What?  They'll only give it to like certain people  Well she did a good job  So who else is in it?  Uh there's another actress  I'm trying to remember her name  What movie?  I'm not too sure for the actress one  Best director 
[01:48:00]  The Social Network  David Fincher  He was great  That movie looked terrific  They won every award already  Won all the New York Critics Awards  Yeah  And Trent Reznor does the music for the Social Network  Doesn't mean shit  Yeah it does  I just said that  It does  And then the Golden Globes  And then  And then you lose at the Oscars  No  That always happens  Yeah  Well last year it didn't  Yeah but rarely though  What was last year's big movie?  Avatar  Which won nothing  In the end  Exactly 
[01:48:30]  No one remembers  What was the big movie last year?

Oh god  Is that the worst?  Horrid  When a girl has some  Slapjacks  When she's got some big melons you'll allow a little sag  A little  If they're big  A little bounce to them  But if they're small and sagging  Oof  Oh god

I bet you there's some funny ones  Don't curse though  They won't print it  Don't say they will  But they won't  Not a fan of the Maxim Jimmy 
[01:55:00]  They're fine  But when you write something  How are they fine?  You just fuck it  They're fine  But when you send something that you've written  And the guy goes  No no we'll make these changes  We won't do it  And then he puts it in the way he wants  And goes  Oh sorry I sent the wrong copy  Did you really?  Really?  Holy shit  Oh yeah  Yeah  Sent the wrong copy  Oh no I said it the wrong one today  Did ya?  That's your words  So people think you said it  I told them  They wanted to change so many things I wrote  In that Halloween article I did 
[01:55:30]  I said  I remember that yeah  I said pull the article  I told my publicist  Yeah  This fucking  If it's a magazine  That is geared towards men  And they don't want certain language  That's fine  But pull the article  Right  Yeah you don't want to  They're not paying me  I don't need to audition for them  I've written two fucking books already  Yeah  I'm sorry  Whenever I don't sleep  I'm fucking very cranky today  Because I flew  And I've been dealing with these  Faggots on Twitter  The Sarah Palin's rhetoric 
[01:56:00]  Yes  Fucking babies  It's uh  No one wants to just take this guy  At a kook value  Because they're saying like  You know  Oh the guns are bad  Okay  So if you're going to punish everybody  Because some piece of garbage  Picks up a gun  And happens to pass the psych test  Then I guess you better  Never let Muslims  Into the military  Because uh  Major Hassan got in  And then yelled  Allahu Akbar  As he fucking murdered  His fellow soldiers  Right  That he was caring for 
[01:56:30]  And that psychopath  Made it  Through the medical profession  Yeah  It happens  It happens  People  Get through  There are crazy cops  There are crazy military guys  Crazy fucking firemen  There are crazy gun owners  It's like  It is what it is  People are crazy everywhere  And people  That's why when the media says  Warning signs missed  We all know someone's crazy  That can at any moment  Do something insane  Yeah  What are we supposed to do  You call the authorities on someone  Because you think  They're completely nuts 
[01:57:00]  And capable of doing something  They're going to hang up on you  They're not going to do anything  Until something happens  The warning signs are always missed  By the way  The media  They have to be  The way they keep showing him  And this is why the media  This is why I never feel bad  Making a joke about something horrible  Because I'm capitalizing  These fucking scumbags  Are printing things  Face of evil  Let me tell you something man  If I wanted attention that bad  That's what I would want written  Of course  So all these little faggots are doing  Is showing worms like this guy 
[01:57:30]  Right  That you will look powerful  And feared  If you murder people  You're famous  And because of what the media is doing  You're fucking famous  There will be a copycat  There's already one  That was threatening what  Somebody in Colorado  There are over the years  Always copycats  Yeah but this one  Making him into kind of a rock star  And doing like Jimmy said  Exactly what he wants  Yeah  So then there's other fucking whack jobs  Out there going  Oh okay  Why did he do it  This is my path  And I get  I get a nice news cycle out of it  And I'm telling you 
[01:58:00]  There's going to be more of this shit  And they print his rhetoric  I mean his  People look at my rhetoric  That's the problem  His fucking ranting  They print them  Oh the mad man  He's a little  He's a broken  Worm of a fucking  He should be just talked about  Like the garbage he is  And what he writes is shit  It was shit  It was shit  He didn't even understand  What the fuck this idiot was saying  He's a fucking  An insect  And he should be talked about  Like he's an insect  Yeah  Not like he's  Oh he's an Eve  The face of evil 
[01:58:30]  That's not the face of evil  And what we gotta do  Of course  Is knee jerk  And just restrict speech  And uh  The second amendment  And everything else  Because uh  I can't tell you  How many times  I've read on twitter  That everyone  That owns a gun  Is complicit in this  It's like  It's like what  Really  Like cause now  The second amendment issue  Comes up  Because this guy  Uh apparently  Sure  Uh bought  Legally  Uh legally 
[01:59:00]  A gun  In Arizona  Which there  There are  No restrictions there  You could just go in  And buy one  I mean uh  And  And for the most part  For the amount of people  That do buy guns in Arizona  And own guns in Arizona  Uh there's not much  Of a problem  But but but you're  Gonna get a kook  Just like you get a kook  In a car  That'll drive into  A crowd of people  It's like  And by the way  Cars  Kill  At least  Four times  The amount of people  That guns kill 
[01:59:30]  Every year  Yet  How come we don't  Make the test for uh  Driving more stringent  How come we don't  Put more regulations  On driving  Uh it's easy  To get a license  How come there isn't  A psych evaluation  For driving  Which isn't a right  By the way  It's a privilege  It's not a constitutional right  And you could drive  From state to state  Without getting a new license  Every time you go through one  You don't have to get a new one  Every state  And you could take out  So many people  With a car  At one time  Uh so why  Why isn't there a big 
[02:00:00]  Hoopla  About automobiles  And how dangerous they are  And how they should be  Regulated uh  Uh more  Uh but  But guns for some reason  Become the bad guy  In this  When a lunatic  Does something like this  They wanna  People  And people are so willing  To just give up  One of their rights  They picked it as number two  Over speech  They went  Well let's  Let's write this out  Um  Freedom of speech  Number one  Now how do we protect  The freedom of speech  Ah 
[02:00:30]  With number two  An armed public  What bothers me  Is this obsession  We have in this country  With blaming  Especially when it's speech  Like  I don't wanna hear  About Sarah Palin  And the  I don't wanna  No  This guy was  Left wing nut  People who knew him  Said that's what he was  And they're somehow  Blaming conservative talk show  It's like  I have never blamed anybody  So I don't wanna hear  You understand  Like I don't blame  I take responsibility 
[02:01:00]  For myself  Right  And if you don't  Well there's people  Well you know what  Then those people  Should be dealt with harshly  Yeah  I'm not gonna  Curtail what I wanna say  I'm not  And no one should  You're not  As long as you're not  Encouraging someone  To yell fire in a movie theater  Or inciting them to riot  Or doing the things  That there are  The provisions in free speech  That does not protect  Right  Sick of this fucking country man  Bunch of babies  Babies  Always looking to blame  Somebody else  Because that's what they want  When they fuck up  Is something else to blame  Right 
[02:01:30]  Isn't it pathetic  To watch  On the news  And to listen to  And to read  On Twitter  It's pathetic  How fucking  Pussy this country is  Because they don't just blame  This guy  What he is  He's a fucking  Lone  Psychopath  Yeah  Piece of garbage  And no system is perfect  No  So you're gonna get  A crazy person  That does shit like this  There's a fucked up thing  About freedom  People love saying 
[02:02:00]  America  It's great  We're free  It's freedom  We have all these freedoms  The constitution has given us  Freedom  Freedom  Freedom  Freedom  Freedom  Does not guarantee you  Safety  But as a matter of fact  The more freedoms  You give individuals  The less safe  You're gonna be  But that's part  Of how this works  When you give people  Individual freedoms  To be your own person  To make things  To make something  Of yourself  To have free speech  To have the right  To bear arms 
[02:02:30]  To have the right  To vote  Whatever right  You're giving people  You're making it  A little more dangerous  Because of everybody  Having these freedoms  But that's the price  You pay  For fucking freedom  Well the argument  Has been made  People are like  Well  Alright  March 5th  You're gonna be  At the Wellmont Theater  Right  Why do tickets  Go on sale  This Friday  At 10am  At 10am  And I'm like  That's not a speech issue  That's just when  They set it up  That's not a rhetoric  Exactly  That's not rhetoric  I don't care about my dump 
[02:03:00]  What am I gonna say  In the fucking Wellmont  In Montclair  March 5th  Who gives a turkey  Fuck this Friday  At 10am  And it's about  Individuality  And it's no one's  Fault either  No one's to blame  But you for being there  And my shitty agent  And the dumb venue  For booking me  Gonna have 80 people  Let's go  Let's go to the phones  Can I have some water  Kenny  I got my ice  Chris on Long Island  Go ahead Chris  Hi Chris  Good morning ladies  Hey Jimmy 
[02:03:30]  I agree with you  You can put some blame  On the media  But more of the blame  Falls on us  Because  Let's just say  Newsday doesn't run  A feature on this  Freaking maniac  But the post does  How many idiots  Are gonna pick up  The post  Instead of newsday  Because they want  To know about this  Let me say  Maybe I didn't  I probably didn't  Say it right  I don't mean  They shouldn't cover it  Because it is news  What I mean is  And I don't  I don't even blame  Them saying  If they glorify  If they make  Other people do it  But what I'm saying  Is when they  It's the phrasing  Of it  Like  Mad eyes 
[02:04:00]  Of a killer  It's like  They're empowering  This little  Scumbag  And they shouldn't be  But I'm not saying  That they shouldn't  Cover it  Okay  Of course they have  It's real news  It is like  The way they do it  I'm not a big fan  Of Mrs. Kalen  But I even said  To my hard  Right leaning father  Months back  That these crosshairs  Was a bad idea  That someone  Was gonna get hurt  Now I'm not saying 
[02:04:30]  This guy did it  Because of what  He saw on her website  But there's not  A fucking maniac  Out there  That she shit like that  Hear the words reload  And run with it  But this  You're right  Hold on  Okay buddy  Because  I don't want to  Blame Sarah Palin  For it  But there were  Certain  Words that we use  That influenced people  Just like  The Fort Worth  Killer  Was influenced  By the words  Of their mom  Hold on  Let me ask you  Just to jump in  With the Sarah Palin  Because  This guy had been 
[02:05:00]  Stalking this woman  For three years  And if we're talking  About phraseology  Everybody knows  The context  In which that  Type of political  Message is meant  Because if that's  The case  If we're that  Fucked up  That we don't know  That the crosshairs  Don't really mean  Shoot somebody  That we better  Never again say  The Jets killed  The Colts  Or  Oh man  I hope the Cowboys  Murder the Giants  Boy we better  Remove all that  From our language  Jimmy  You're talking to 
[02:05:30]  A group of  Rational people  Who see that bullseye  No it doesn't mean  I  A liar  What I do  This is  You're out and  Fucking shoot  The Congress  So I understand  I'm not saying  So we have to  What we have to do  Is base our whole world  On catering to lunatics  So we can't  We can't express ourselves  Then what's the problem?  Take a marginal responsibility  For what you  For the  Responsibility for what?  A lunatic 
[02:06:00]  Doing something  Based on something  That's completely  Crazy?  Okay so then  Why would  Most people on the right  Blame the  Fort Hood shooter  On the words of an imam?  Because the guy  Was  Because  I'll tell you why  Because the guy  Hold on  I'll explain  Dude I'll explain  Why  A  He is a loose cannon  B  They didn't just  Blame it on him  Because he shot  He was yelling  Allahu Akbar  As he shot  That's like 
[02:06:30]  If this guy  Was yelling  Sarah Palin's target  While he shot  Then you'd have a point  But this guy  Hold on  Dude  Major Hassan  Had communications  With this guy  This guy did not have  Communication with  Sarah Palin  If you can't see  The difference  Between a guy  Who had been quoted  Talking about jihad  And talking about  How he believed  In a lot of these causes  And then murdering people  With a guy like this  That I don't know  What to tell you  You know the difference  You're just trying  To make an argument  I do know the difference 
[02:07:00]  My question is  Why does Sarah Palin  Have to use words  Like Reload  And put crosshands  On congressional districts  Why did you do that  Why?  I don't know  But again  If you look through  Hold on  I don't know why  But if you look through  Liberal or Democratic candidates  I'm sure they've all  Used terminology  That they think  Is harsh  And graphic  And graphic  And hard hitting  But not to the extent  As it's been  For the last few years  And you've got to admit that  No I don't  You haven't seen  You haven't seen  The Democratic map 
[02:07:30]  With the fucking  Targets  The bullseyes  On it  I honestly have not  Oh you didn't  Well it's readily available  If you just fucking  Google it  Google Democratic target map  And you'll see  The same thing  Yeah same thing  There it is  I didn't know  They use that  How about Obama  Saying bring in  Knife to a gunfight  Is that a friend  We've been using  For 40, 50, 50 years  What?  They don't bring a knife  To a gunfight  Yeah yeah exactly  But oh my god  Someone might hear that 
[02:08:00]  Some lunatic  Might hear that  And Obama  Is inspiring somebody  To bring a gun  To a fight  Because he was talking  About something political  This is what you're saying  You're making this out  That we as rational  Human beings  Have to curtail  Our speech  And our actions  Just to protect ourselves  Against lunatics  It ain't gonna happen  And it's not the way  It should happen  Alright so  What you're saying  Is we should be allowed  To talk the way we want  Yes  By as many  Wait a second  By as many fucking 
[02:08:30]  Extended clips  As are legal now  I didn't say that  An innocent nine year old girl  Gets capped in the head  An abortion doctor  Who Glenn Beck  Fucking bilifies  On the TV  Gets killed  By the way  I can't buy  An extended magazine  They're illegal  In New York  In New York  Yeah  The regulations  Are all different regulations  All over the states  What the fuck  Is anyone supposed  To do about it  That's how this country  Runs with the second amendment  Let's put different regulations 
[02:09:00]  And different laws  Over one fucking  Constitutional amendment  And fuck everything up  How about this  How about this  And I brought this up  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  How about the fact  That Chicago  Chicago  It's illegal  To own a gun  Illegal  That is probably  The strictest gun control  You could ever have  You can't own a gun  Yet they have the highest  Gun violence  In the country  How does that now  Show me  That gun control works  Uh  Look at England  They don't have guns 
[02:09:30]  And they have a huge  Fucking gun problem  In England  Huge  They do  Yes  I didn't know  Huge gun problem  Why don't you just admit  Dude  Why don't you just admit  Why is Chicago  You're politicizing  Running rampant  With gun violence  When you're not allowed  The law says  You can't have a gun  How much more regulation  Can you put on  You already aren't  Allowed to have it  Illegally  Motherfucker  Illegally  So you can't 
[02:10:00]  Legislate  Against  Legal gun ownership  And  You can't  Legislate  Against  Law abiding  Citizens  And make that  Help  The problem  With criminals  And lunatics  That are gonna  Get their hands  On guns anyway  Or cars  Or rocks  Or knives  Or bow and arrows  Or whatever  The fuck else  They're gonna use  Do you know  What's funny  This was interesting  This guy is a  Left wing extremist  And you're blaming  Conservative ideologies 
[02:10:30]  Or  Or  Or  Or talk shows  And the odd thing was  When Timothy McVeigh  Did what he did  He was a fucking  He was a terrorist  Nobody blamed  The supermarket  For selling him  The fertilizer  Or the other things  Everybody put  The onus  On where it was  That guy  Was a  Was a psychopath  And he was a piece of shit  And he was an  Extremist  It was  It was his doing  This guy's a lunatic  Stop  Blaming 
[02:11:00]  Everybody  For people's behavior  Take responsibility  For yours  I'll take responsibility  For mine  And if there are people  Who are psychopaths  And misuse the language  Then they should be dealt with  Harshly  And unforgivingly  Mm-hmm  So  So then why can't  Somebody take responsibility  For their speech as well  Dude we do have  Hold on hold on  We do  Freedom of speech  Does not cover  Inciting people to riot  It does not cover  Yelling fire 
[02:11:30]  In a movie theater  It does not  Cover I think  Things like defamation  There are things  But people  How about this  Should Ozzy Osbourne  Take responsibility  For songs  Because people  Committed suicide  Or Judas Priest  People  Misinterpreting  The message  That somebody  Is trying to convey  Is not  The responsibility  Of the person  Speaking openly  And honestly  Okay  Anthony let me ask you  This question  What does  Somebody mean by  Taking a second 
[02:12:00]  Amendment remedies  If they don't win  Their election  What does that mean  What  Taking a second  Amendment  Remedies  When they couldn't  Win an election  If we don't win  By the battle  We'll take our  Second amendment remedy  I have no idea  Who said that  That's some crazy  Goofy bitch down south  Oh okay  I don't agree with that  What am I supposed  To fucking  Alright  No no okay  But what do you think  She meant by that  I have no idea  It sounds  You don't even know  Her name dude  You don't even know  Her name 
[02:12:30]  I have no idea  What that means  What context it's in  It sounds menacing  But I don't fucking know  Okay  Sounds menacing  So now if somebody  In her district  Took a second  Amendment solution  To the person  In one election  Would she not have  Any kind of  Blood on her hands  For her speech  Maybe that means  Campaigning for  Second amendment rights  I don't know  How do you know  What she meant  You don't know  Her name  You don't know  Her name  I don't know  What it means  Alright Chris  She's a liberal  Blaming everybody  God damn it 
[02:13:00]  Chris  I gotta move on  Because we got  A lot of people  That run in  Rich in Queens  Rich you're on  The Opie and Anthony  Show  Hey boys  How you doing  Hello  I'll make this quick  First of all  The Obama court  You're saying  There's a knife  And gun thing  It's worse  Than what you're  Saying it is  And he said  If they bring  A knife  We're gonna  Bring a gun  Yeah right  Right  It's violent  Yeah  Okay my point  Is I was arguing  With a big  Of course a friend  Of mine  Who's a big  Way lefty  Who within minutes  Of this happening  Was blaming  A tea party  Blaming Palin  See this is what  Happened  Thinking he was  A right winger  When it came out 
[02:13:30]  Later in the day  That it was a left  Winger  He's like well  It's still the  Right wing's fault  Because they ramped up  The rhetoric  And well what's  The left supposed to do  So apparently the right  Has mind control  Powers now  Mind control  Mind control  I think it was  It's always  Palin  It's always the right  Even when it's the left  Doing something  Well the right  Made us do it  It's amazing  I do not like  Sarah Palin  I like I said  She's kryptonite  For the Republican party  And the next  Presidential election  In two years 
[02:14:00]  I hope she stays  The fuck away  I don't like her  At all  But to blame  To just bring her name  Up at all  In this situation  Is the dumbest  Fucking thing  It is really  And it's only because  They're blaming  If they were blaming  Left wing  And right wing  Talk  Talk  Hosts  Or whatever  I would go  You know what  This is just America  But this is just  Liberals  Being sniveling  Babies  And I'm saying this  Only because  I've only heard them 
[02:14:30]  Mention  Conservative people  Yeah  That's not me  Defending conservative ideology  That's  A left wing  Guy  Who people know  He was a left wing  Pothead  Murders another  A democrat  And people are  Blaming Russian  And Palin  It's fucking  Mind boggling  I would never  Blame  A liberal  Blogger  Or a liberal  Or Rachel Maddow  Or Keith  Oberman  If some  Left wing  Nut  Went out  And murdered  A conservative  I would never  Blame  Oberman  Who I hate 
[02:15:00]  I would never  Blame  Rachel Maddow  Or any other  Liberal  Never  No you blame  The lunatic  I would never  Occur to me  To blame them  That does this  Let's go to  Jason  Of Staten Island  Jason  Hey good morning  Boys  Morning  I got some  Breaking news  On CNN  The FBI  Stopped a plot  To shoot up  Bogada  This Saturday  And Sunday  Jimmy  Oh god  Thank god  Because the late show  Is almost sold out  And it will be  By Wednesday  They say  Good plug sir  Let's work on  Moncler  Go ahead  Anthony  I am 
[02:15:30]  A strict independent  I do believe  That people should  Have the right  To own guns  With you know  Some gun control  You know  You can't get  Put the guns  In the hands  Of the kooks  Out there  That's racist  You said  You said  That cars  Kill four times  More people  Than guns do  Every year  But wouldn't you  Agree that  A lot more  People own  A car  Than they do  A gun  And on top  Of that  That people  Don't own  Cars strictly  For the purpose  Of hurting 
[02:16:00]  Other people  Well I don't  Where guns  You do own  A gun  If a gun  Is being used  To kill somebody  It was purposely  Being used  To kill somebody  If a car  Is used to  Kill somebody  Is that being  Purposely used  But they have  Been  That's for sure  Cars have been  Used to kill  People on purpose  And when somebody  Starts driving down  The wrong side  Of the street  On a highway  And creams  A fucking car  Head on  And kills people  That's just as  Dangerous as  Somebody picking up  A gun  That's loaded  And waving it  Around  It's the same  Fucking thing 
[02:16:30]  That's stupidity  Not purposeful  No it's stupidity  On both people's  Parts  On the gun  Irresponsible  Gun owner  Or irresponsible  Driver  What I'm saying  Is everyone's  Looking to put  More restriction  On gun ownership  For people that  Are responsible  Gun owners  Why not put  More restrictions  On driving  And make it  Harder for people  To get a driver's  License  Because that seems  To be a problem  In this country  If you ask me  I've got no  Problem with that 
[02:17:00]  Also  But like I said  What about the fact  That a lot more  People own cars  So there will be  More incidents  Of people getting  Killed  I don't care about  The numbers  And why  I'm just talking  About the basic  You get 44,000 people  Getting killed  In car wrecks  In a year  Then there's a problem  Apparently there's  Irresponsible people  That are being given  Driver's license  Maybe they're insane  Maybe they're  Homicidal  Maybe they're suicidal  Why don't we go 
[02:17:30]  Through these  Screaming  Why don't we  Screen these people  Why don't we  Screen these people  So we have more  Responsible drivers  On the road  Less deaths  The majority  The majority of those  That's our accident  Oh so and the  Majority of gun  Owners  Wait wait wait  The majority  Of gun owners  Are responsible  And never kill anybody  Absolutely  I'm not saying  That you take guns  Away from people  I'm saying  Well you're not  You're not  And the second 
[02:18:00]  Somebody says  They're not trying  To take your guns  What they're doing  Is starting at A  And Z  Is taking your guns  A is  Restricting ammunition  Magazines  Put some more  Restrictions on  Who's to get them  Who's not to get them  And then they  Don't stop  The lobbies  Don't stop  They will keep  Going and going  Until there is  A gun free  United States of America  And the second  Amendment's repealed  So never  Try to tell me 
[02:18:30]  You or the other  People that tweet  Me all the time  That no one's  Coming for your guns  Because  They're at step  A  B or C  I'm not saying  That there's a good  Facture of the left  That does want to  Come for your guns  But there are people  Like me  Who want to see  A median  We want to see  Some kind of  Gray area  In between  Where I'm not  Saying take a gun  There is  There is a gray area  How about this  How about this  Come into New York City  With a gun  And show it to a cop  Could you do that for me  Because you'll go to jail  For two fucking years 
[02:19:00]  How's that for gun control  That to me  Does that  Does that seem  A little excessive  Or is that  Is that  Is that good for you  I don't necessarily  Agree with that  I think that  Again  Responsible  Gun owners  Should be able to carry  Yeah well  Try to exercise  Your second amendment right  In many cities  Around this country  And you know what  You'll end up in jail  I totally agree with you  What I'm saying is  That they still need  To be done things  To keep it out of the hands  Of a kid like that 
[02:19:30]  Well you know what  Here's what I'm saying  I understand  I understand that part of it  I am not into lunatics  Owning firearms  Believe me  If there's a way  To screen that out  We should do it  I agree with that  What I'm saying is  We live in a free nation  Where we have rights  And one of these rights  Is to bear arms  And unfortunately  When you're given  Rights and freedoms  It  Sometimes people  Are going to get  A hold of things  That can hurt other people 
[02:20:00]  Whether it's  A gun  Or a car  Or fucking  A rock  It's going to happen  There's no perfect system  In place for anything  This is one thing  I noticed too  It seems like  When people say  Like say somebody  Says something inflammatory  And there's a problem  Or somebody does  Something like this  How come when  Somebody abuses a right  Or is proven  Or is a psycho  We want to take  The right away  From other people  That didn't do anything wrong  What is that  I don't know why  That instinct  Is in Americans  I mean  I'm not looking to do that 
[02:20:30]  I'm not saying you are  I'm saying  Like when Imus said  I got to pull up  I got to let my stuff  So get the crap out of me  For a few hours  All right  Take care  Like when Imus said  What he said  The reaction was  Everybody overreacted  When Michael Richards  Yelled nigger  In the laugh factory  That is what pushed  The n-word  To be bad  Like one guy  Does something stupid  And the whole country  We're a bunch of sheep  Yeah  We hear a thought  And we just follow  Knee jerk reaction  What a bunch of  Fucking dummies we are 
[02:21:00]  To just hit a fucking  Birthday candle  With a fire hose  What a bunch of followers  That's what we  We love doing  Yeah  I mean literally  All I'm saying  People are going  You're the Fox News  Of comedians  All I'm saying  Is I take responsibility  For my own shit  And I expect you  To do the same  Who said that  Just some dummy  On Twitter  I don't even  I would never vote  For Sarah Palin  I'm the news 12  Of radio personality  Jesus  You're the Walter Cronk cunt  Let's say hi 
[02:21:30]  To JJ in Pennsylvania  JJ  Hey how's it  The dynamite  Yuck  Quick  Paint skinny people  Dancing in loose hats  A cello  Sorry that was my JJ  Cello  I'm sorry  What do you have  To say JJ  Somebody got shot  Alright go ahead  Sorry guys  Yeah I said it  JJ and PA  But they got it wrong  Screeners 
[02:22:00]  No big deal  I was watching  Hannity  The other night  And he had a guy  On that actually  Subdued  This cockroach  That shot all these  People in Arizona  And he was actually  Carrying a gun with him  He was inside the store  When he heard the shots  Yeah  And he came out  With his gun  Prepared to use it  Hannity asked him  Point blank  Or I believe it was Hannity  How come he did you  Shoot the scumbag  In the head right there  On the spot  And the guy said  It wasn't my place  Yeah because  He was already 
[02:22:30]  Being subdued  At that point  And it wouldn't  Have been  It wouldn't have been  Kosher to blow his head  Off at that point  Although I don't think  Anybody would have  Argued  Or I don't even  Think this guy  Would have  Oh somebody would have  Because then the left  Would defend him  Going well  He was a troubled  Young man  More importantly  What Sean had said  Was how the guy  Didn't rip his arm  Out of his socket  Because the guy  Was complaining  Ow you're hurting my arm  This guy I guess  Was holding his feet  But he was  Ow you're hurting my arm  How do you say that 
[02:23:00]  After you shoot people  Nine year old  Because he's crazy  This guy should have  Just been killed  On the spot  Everyone saw him do it  He literally  They should have  Held him there  And somebody should have  Backed the car  Over his skull  Yeah  Oops  Like he has nothing  To contribute  No never will  Thank you JJ  More  Burden  More importantly  Kingston Pete  I like Kingston Pete  From Canada  I love how Anthony  Took his second amendment  Right speech  Right to the top  Last night  On Twitter  And took on  Elaine Boosler  I want to know  About that  Elaine Boosler  Is a douche 
[02:23:30]  Cunt  Fuck her  Tell us how you  Really feel  Oh Chip  Wasn't she the  Inspiration for  For Elaine on  Seinfeld  That Elaine Boosler  Was she though  I don't know  I thought it was  Somebody else  So you took on  Elaine Boosler  Last night  I need details  I just commented  On one of her  Stupid  What did she have to  Say about this  Whole issue  One of her stupid  Tweets  Well of course  She's blaming guns  Everybody blames  The actual machine  Somebody said  It's like blaming  A hammer  For building a house  It's not  You know  It's a tool  Like anything else  And it's who's 
[02:24:00]  Using it  That gets the  Result  The final result  But she's got  These  She's trying to  Come up with  These clever  Quips  About  Guns  And  Like  One of them  Was  I got it  Okay  I want to  Read through  Your tweets  Last night  Yeah  So you  Retweeted  Elaine Boosler  Saying  NRA  Isn't about  Rights  It's about  Money  Okay  She's right  Yeah  And then you  Wrote  Is that what  You wrote  Okay 
[02:24:30]  How about  We take away  Your first  Amendment  You slob  And then she  Call her a slob  Of course  And then she  Had this tweet  That you retweeted  The right to be  An arms bearer  Guarantees the right  To be a pallbearer  That's pretty clever  And I said  Let me quote  Boy Gary  You unfunny  Piece of shit  Well you're going  Right for the old  Throw the roll  That was from  You gotta linger  Longer than that  The famous  Years ago  When Gary  Delabate  Took on 
[02:25:00]  Elaine Boosler  And her husband  When Howard  Was doing a broadcast  It was hysterical  Just called her  An unfunny  Piece of shit  And then what I like  It's stuck for years  And then what I like  About your Twitter  I see the picture  But go back  To the actual tweet  Ant decides to  Take a slight break  On the whole issue  And he tweets  Okay has anyone else  Noticed that this  Old bag has  Great big tits  Yeah  She's from this  Financial freedom  Commercial  About  Reverse mortgages 
[02:25:30]  And she's wearing  A red turtleneck sweater  She's an old  Bag  And she's got  Giant tits  In a red sweater  What a droopy  She looks like  Cloris Leachman  If she had a stroke  Yes  She's all  Her face  What a droopy dog  But her tits are giant  They couldn't be hers  Maybe they put  Her old lady head  On some fucking  A net funicello  Picture from the 60's  Some big  Have some  Skippy peanut butter  You cunt  Isn't that what she ate  Or is it Jif  God damn  There's two things 
[02:26:00]  You don't see  When you walk around  New York City  You don't see  Really old tall guys  And you don't see  Old women with big tits  It's true  Think about it  Next time you're walking around  What's that about  That got me  So if you're really tall  You die young  And if you have really big tits  I think you die young  You die young  That's my conclusion today  Did you get back to the issue  After that  Yes you did  Well I did for a little bit  And then I went off  On another tangent  Then you go with  Retweeting Elaine Boosler  I guess  I don't need to have a gun  Oh this is somebody  Yeah somebody  It gets confusing  When there's a couple 
[02:26:30]  Retweets in one tweet  I know  I think this is this guy  Greg or whatever it is  He said  I don't need  To have a gun  Weak pussies carry guns  And I said  So Greg  If your girl  Is being raped  Do you want a gun now?  Like  And then somebody  Got on me like  Oh Anthony  All you bring up  Are the most extreme  Circumstances  It's like yeah  That's when you would need  To protect yourself  That is kind of 
[02:27:00]  When you want the gun  That's a healthy thing  Anthony's doing  Anthony would be wrong  If he was bringing it up  Like what if someone  Changes the channel  When you're watching something  That's a terrible example  The rape's a good example  Rape is a good example  And I was watching  A program  I survived  The other day  And it's a couple  In Mexico  By Gloria Gaynor  Oh  Full show on that  One hit wonder  A couple in Mexico  How awful would that be  Driving a motorhome  And got  Got kidnapped 
[02:27:30]  For a little while  Oh their whole house  Got taken  Yeah their whole house  Humiliating  And two  Two Mexican  Desperados  Of course  Of course  Held a gun  To the guy's head  They were inside  Their motorhome  If the guy had a weapon  They never would have  Gotten in the motorhome  But the bad guys  Had a weapon  They got in the motorhome  And the guy  Had to sit there  On his knees  While  His wife  Was on her knees  Sucking the guy's dick  Giving him oral sex  While the guy 
[02:28:00]  Watched  And was powerless  To do anything  Because he had a gun  To the back of his head  Did she have to blow  Both of them  One of the guys  And then the other guy  Came over  And pulled her pants down  And fucked her in the ass  Oops  And this guy  Had to watch  This whole fucking thing happen  And  And he hired those guys  He looked cuckled  Cuckled by force  Cuckboy Chet  Guaranteed  That guy  Was wishing  He had some type  Of weapon on him  What happened  Did the guy  Shoot them  No no  They ransacked

[02:31:00]  It's a manual  And all we want to do  Is tweak it  And every time  We do that  These guys win  We're letting them  Get their point across  Scare the hell out of us  And then change  The constitution  Yeah people are so willing  To just have their rights  Ripped away from them  They're just  They're asking for it  They're begging  Please please  Rip my rights away  And please government  Save me and protect me  You know what  Unfortunately  They don't have a cop station 
[02:31:30]  At everybody's house  And they don't have  An escort  An armed escort  That can walk you  Around everywhere  So sometimes  You gotta  Take your own protection  Into your own hands  And there are bad  Bad people out there  I live  I live in a rural area  Everybody out here  We self-police  You know  No one's gonna  Rob a house  In the middle of nowhere  Because they know  That person's smart enough  If he's living out there  He's damn willing  To protect himself  And you know 
[02:32:00]  This guy  The best thing  That could happen  To this guy  Down there  You know  A speedy trial  I don't mean  Let's drag it out  For a month  I want to see  The death penalty  Levied on this guy  Within 30 days  That'll never happen  Stop  You're a crazy person  It'll never happen  It'll never happen  It'll never happen  There's too much  Political capital  They're already  They're already posturing  With the lawyer  That fucking  Defended Ted Kaczynski  Oh he's obviously  Very good  Jesus  What's his record  0 in 60  Who else did he have  The fucking  Hillside Strangler 
[02:32:30]  Timothy McVeigh  Fucking Oswald  McVeigh  McVeigh  And the Unabomber  And the Unabomber  That's what I defended  In the past  This guy's good  Richard Ramirez  Was his  Bundy  I got Bundy  Death  KC2  Wow  This guy's terrific  The Menendez  Present  Both mine  Fucking idiot  Yeah  But it looks to me  Like it's going to be  One of these  Long drawn out  Fucking things  Where  Ten years from now  He's just going to  Try to keep the guy  Out of a death penalty  He's going to 
[02:33:00]  Try to paint him  As crazy  Can I throw  Something else out there  We all saw the mug shot  And he's  You know  He gets to smile  And smirk  Is there a way  That they could say  You know  Fucking take that smirk  Off your face  There is a way  But then they'll  Take the picture  And say  Why is his  Mouth smashed  Well how about  Just sit there  And just wait  I don't know  I think maybe  Sometimes they  Take these shots  And think it's  It's worse for the guy  To see him like that  Really  Yeah because you look  And go  Oh that infuriates  How's that worse  It infuriates people more 
[02:33:30]  Yeah but he don't care  That's what he wants  Well he doesn't  Going back to Jimmy's point  He wants fame  He doesn't want to be hated  But here it is  If you're taking that mug shot  Wouldn't  Wouldn't you be like  Good  He's smiling  People will hate this  And then you take the picture  And it makes people  Hate him even more  I hope somebody  Kills him in jail  That'd be nice  Yeah yeah  Give him the old  Fucking big pipe  Over the head  Shank him  But I think in that moment  Because again  Everyone saw him do it  There's no doubt  They all watched him do it  They should have just 
[02:34:00]  Backed a car over his head  Yep  Oops  Sorry I was leaving  The parking lot  Unfortunately that's  Never the case though  It's like Richard  Richard  Who's the guy  That tried to blow up  His shoes  Like whenever they had  The shoe bomber  Or the underwear bomber  Those guys both  Should have been  Slaughtered on the plane  For that  They never should have  Made it off the plane alive  Right  But they did  Yeah yeah  But they did  Because it was a guarantee  You knew  Who was doing what  Everyone jumped on them  Doing it  They both should have  Been killed on the plane  Absolutely

[02:55:30]  On Twitter  Google Don Cherry  Toronto Mayor speech  Don goes off on Liberals  And will love it  Really?  Don Cherry  The Canadian Don Cherry  He's another Canadian  He's the Toronto Mayor  Wait  What?  So we can go back  To our Don Cherry bit  So there's another  Canadian Don Cherry  He's the Mayor of Toronto  That isn't the 77 year old  February 5th birthday  Hockey Don Cherry  Right  Not to be confused 
[02:56:00]  With the one hit  Wonder Zero  Oh it's a band of gold  Guy  Nothing  Which has nothing to do  With Frida Payne's  Version band of gold  He's dressed very strangely  Is this the Mayor?  He's in a pink  Guess so  Type suit  Let's try it  I mean the listener  Is bad about 28%  Oh my god  This could  There's no way  That's Mayor Rob Ford  That's Rob  It's a Brian Dennehy  He really does 
[02:56:30]  Silly Canadian  Dumb thing he's wearing  We gotta get to the other name  Big cuffs on his shirt  Alright here we go  Oh wow  It's like the head of Starfleet  Well actually I'm wearing pink gold  For all the pink golds out there  That ride bicycles and everything  I thought I'd get it in  He's dressed like the first aid patient  Would you expect Ron McLean here?  You sure this isn't Don Cherry?  You know I have to  That's Hockey Don Cherry  Wait wait wait  This is Hockey Don Cherry 
[02:57:00]  Now we get back to Don Cherry Hockey Guy  Wait so this isn't the Mayor of Toronto?  No the Mayor introduced him as a special guest  So the Mayor of Toronto is not named Don Cherry  No  That listener  No  So this is the actual Don Cherry  This is Don Cherry the Hockey Guy  With the awesome suits  Talking about something  Pinkos  Yeah  When I woke up this morning  I did not realize  We were going to spend an hour on  The name Don Cherry  Don Cherry  Who knew there was all that?  So now we're going hockey great 
[02:57:30]  Well as in he knows the sport  This is Don Cherry  Coach  Canadian  He never played though  Hockey  I'm not sure  Guy  He probably played but not in the NHL  I would assume  77 years old  We will wish him a happy birthday  On February 5th  Yes  And now  Travis puts it on the list  So the Mayor of Toronto  Is not named Don Cherry  But the Mayor of Toronto  Introduced Don Cherry  Who walked to the podium  In one of his flamboyant  Jackets that he likes to wear  When he does his hockey night in Canada  Okay  And in this case it's pink  Let's go  Special guest 
[02:58:00]  Mr. Don Cherry  Hold on pause  It gets even worse  Because the Mayor of Toronto  Is a woman  No no  The guy was the Mayor  Earlier  But I thought he introduced Don Cherry  No he was on before Don Cherry  Do you want to just watch the whole 20 seconds  From the beginning  I know we were trying to get to Don Cherry  But I think there's too much confusion  This is some Don Ford  This is the Mayor of Rob Ford  They're applauding for Mayor Rob Ford  Rob Ford  Okay  He's got some big  Yeah  Kind of looks like a Chris Farley brother 
[02:58:30]  Right  Did we make that joke?

[02:59:00]  We have to postpone your speech  Cause I'm taking an Activia duty  Into the cuffs of my pants  Activia  A nice watery Activia shit  That's why they were applauding  By the way  If you go to the very beginning  Just real quick  I know  To back up  Right now  I don't  No pause  I've actually seen this  Mayor Rob Ford  Said I'm gonna get out of here  Because I have to fuck a child in the mouth  People love it

I tweeted a nice picture of the meeting last time  I used a pano app 
[03:16:00]  And I did a panoramic view of the entire room of us sleeping  Did you see  Did you see the picture  I tweeted yesterday  It's one of these fucking mega pixel pictures  But they call it the fucking gigantapixel picture  It was on break.com  And it was a picture  And then they were fucking zooming in to show you the detail  Oh really?  Are those things real?  I'm late to the party on these  Some people say it's real  Some people say it's fake  Oh that it's trickery?  This guy took a picture of a mountainside

Yes  Now they show the picture right  There's a guy  On the top of a mountain  And then they zoom out  To show you where it is  In the actual photo 
[03:17:30]  And look at this  Uh  That's pretty far  Um  Wow  Wow  And then they  You can go to break.com  Check it out  It's still on the front page  Then they go to the top  Of this little fucking peak  And they show you  Individual hikers up there  That photo exists somewhere  Don't it?
