<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts excitedly discussing their upcoming trip to Boston, including a live broadcast from WBCN studios and a Halloween party (“Grave Rave”) featuring the Crystal Method.  A $1000 “boob-a-lantern” contest, involving women with breast implants using flashlights in a dark closet, was heavily promoted.  Mick Foley (Mankind/Cactus Jack) was announced as an in-studio guest, promoting his children’s book, “Halloween Hijinks”.  Several women participating in the boob-a-lantern contest were also expected to be in studio.

A caller recounted a deeply emotional experience at a U2 concert, where the names of 9/11 victims were displayed on the video screens, prompting intense audience reaction. This led to a discussion about the lingering impact of 9/11 and the hosts' anger towards vendors in Times Square profiting from the tragedy, using offensive language to express their disgust at these individuals and their nationalities. The hosts then dissected the U2 concert, discussing the visual display, the audience's reaction, the artificiality of concert encores, and U2's use of technology.  They also criticized Hillary Clinton’s reception at different events, expressing negative views towards her.  Comedic relief was provided by a humorous song about Cipro, a Don West impression selling Cipro and AZT, and recurring jokes about a child with progeria.  The hosts also lamented their poor syndication in Chicago, frequently preempted for minor league hockey and T-ball, and mocked a report of Rush Limbaugh broadcasting with a disconnected phone line, mimicking this scenario in a bit.

A segment featured a conversation with a child, referred to as the "Peoria kid," who had multiple medical conditions resulting in a frail physique.  He humorously described meeting celebrities like Britney Spears and Bono through Make-A-Wish, exaggerating his frailty and interactions for comedic effect, contrasting his unusual physical state with normal activities like skateboarding and video games.  The hosts sarcastically referred to him as a “normal kid.” The conversation shifted to Opie and Anthony's own subpar U2 concert seats next to "Stalker Patty," blaming producer Earl and culminating in Earl being forced to pick cotton as punishment. This segment was filled with crude language and offensive jokes.

Mick Foley’s in-studio appearance followed, where he discussed “Halloween Hijinks,” mentioning its controversial predecessor, “Naked Elf.” He shared humorous wrestling anecdotes, including injuries and interactions with Triple H, discussed his experiences meeting fans and signing books (comparing it to Kathy Lee Gifford’s attendance), and revealed his aversion to shaking hands due to a germophobic experience.  The conversation continued with further discussion of his wrestling career.  This segment also included numerous other calls and commercials.  The discussion included topics such as professional wrestling, the careers of Stone Cold Steve Austin and Vince McMahon, and the impact of Owen Hart's death on Foley.  A caller received a promise of tickets to a WWF event.  Foley recounted a humorous anecdote about William Regal.

This portion of the show featured numerous listener calls, the recurring Cipro song, and a focus on the “Booba Lantern” contest. A listener played a prank call where someone impersonated John Rocker calling Ted Turner.  The show also played audio clips of people with intellectual disabilities singing karaoke, described as “retard singing.”  A long, graphic, and highly offensive segment followed, involving the hosts and a Tom Brokaw impersonator engaging in a sexually explicit and racist rant against Dan Rather, filled with homophobic and vulgar language.  The rant centered on perceived competition between the news anchors regarding anthrax coverage. The broadcast concluded with a “What Did We Learn?” segment summarizing the show's content.

A final segment featured numerous listener calls and debates about the show's personalities (“Stinky,” “Garrett,” “Norton”) and the anticipated Kevin Bacon appearance.  The recurring term “P-Boy” was humorously (or at least intended to be humorously) used throughout.  A visit from women from the Privileged Gentleman’s Club ensued, with sexually explicit banter focusing on their physical attributes.  The women shared their stage names and described their work, with the hosts frequently using vulgar language and sexual innuendo.  The segment concluded with another mention of Anthony's mother's (unplayed) singing recording and a promotional push for the Privileged Gentleman’s Club. A final caller expressed strong negative opinions about the show and its hosts.

[00:02:00]  Ann, this is our first one to just hang out.  No, it's going to be pretty casual.  Yeah.  This is our first live appearance in Boston  since we had to go in the middle of nowhere  to intro crappy bands with sand all over the place.  I remember that.  Yeah!  Hey!  Let's truck in a bunch of sand and call it an indoor beach party.  Yeah!  Then the people won't notice that it's a bunch of crappy bands.  Crappy bands.

Which is starting to shape up to be a nice contest.  A lot of people commenting on the boobs that are already up.  Yep.  We had the lovely girls from Double D's in yesterday 
[00:03:00]  and some of the implants really showing up.  That last one, the last batch,  swear to God, looks like the pictures of the Martian landscape.  Looks like Mars.  Yeah.  From one of the spacecraft.  I don't think people fully understand how well breast implants glow.  It's amazing.  When you put the girl in a pitch dark closet  and you just put flashlights under their boobs.  Yeah.  You don't see anything else except the boobs just lighting up  in this really, really nice red color. 
[00:03:30]  Isn't it great?  So you can go to opiananthony.com  and check out the contestants we have so far.  Ladies, all you have to do is come down today or tomorrow  between the hours of 3 and 7 if you're in the New York area.  We'll get the trip up.  Yeah.  So the silly girls seemed very game.  And then Monday and Tuesday next week,  all the ladies in the Boston area can come by the BCN studios  between 3 and 7 Monday and Tuesday  to get in on the boob-a-lantern contest.  Real fast, first prize is $1,000 cash.  There you go.  So third prize is tickets to see Aerosmith pretty much anywhere. 
[00:04:00]  Well, you can see them in Boston, New York, or Philly.  Second place DVD player from Samsung and a Boogeyman DVD.  So we have ladies definitely coming by for the boob-a-lantern contest today.  And Mick Foley, Mankind.  Mankind, yeah.  Cactus Jack.  We'll be here at 5 o'clock today with his children's book.  He's got a children's book.  Not much writing in his children's book.  Well, he put out two books so far.  He's a great author, he really is.  He's pumping those books out. 
[00:04:30]  It's amazing.  And now he's got a children's book?  Yeah.  That's, okay.  A lot of illustrations in it.  Can't wait to see it.  Oh, illustrations.  Who illustrated it?  It's pretty good.  Let me see.  It's really not that bad if you have a kid or something, you know.  Halloween hijinks.  Mick Foley's Halloween hijinks.  It looks like the Brian Regan bit,  where Brian Regan talks about the big...  Yeah, yeah, that big...  He does a great bit on children's books. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  With the...  Like, there's only four words on each page.  Yeah, it just says,  The clock.  Tick tock.  Tick tock.  And then the last page...  The clock goes tick tock.  And the last page.  The end.  And then turns over the book,  and it's like 1795.  It's a great bit when he does it, I know.  Who illustrated...  Illustrations by...  Oh, Jill Thompson.  I don't know.  I thought maybe another wrestler did the illustrations.  Didn't Jerry the King used to illustrate books? 
[00:05:30]  Right?  Yeah.  I think he did collaborate with...  I think he told us that once.  Sure.  Before his girl ditched him and he got fired.  Look, there's a cutout stand-up of Vince McMahon.  Vince McMahon.  Who was a billionaire for Halloween?  Vince McMahon costumes.  Billions of dollars not included.  Cool.  So we'll talk to Mick about it.  All right.  It's late as fuck.  Oh, my kid's fuck.  And let's go right to the phones and talk to Rocky.  Rocky, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Good, man. 
[00:06:00]  Listen, I'm doing the U2 tonight.  I wanted to know, how was the show last night?  Oh, it was great.  Greatest band in the world.  Yeah, those guys rock.  You know, I like to say SCP is the best live show.  I mean, you know, Godsmack, Metallica.  You forget how great U2 is in concert.  Legendary.  Un-effing-believable last night.  Where are they playing tonight?  In New York again?  Yeah, Madison Square Garden.  Yeah, okay.  Oh, you're going to love it.  Oh, you know what?  We shouldn't talk about the ending then.  No, I don't talk about the ending, I guess. 
[00:06:30]  No, I'm not going to do it.  We'll talk about it tomorrow.  Oh, man, I wanted to talk about that, too.  What?  You've got to wait until Monday.  They're playing all week?  And then they're playing in Providence.  Oh, this syndication blows.  They do something really...  I think they do something really cool at the end of the concert.  It depressed me a little bit.  Well, if you don't show any emotion, then you're not human.  Then you're not human.  It pissed me off, I've got to say.  Well, we'll talk...  Like, I know it also did what it was supposed to do, which is get you... 
[00:07:00]  I won't ruin it or anything, but get you, like, to remember and just get some emotion out.  Right.  What it did, it gets me so angry.  I get so pissed off when I'm reminded of events and it gets very personal, let's just say.  Well, they had to do something.  They're playing in the middle of New York City.  I know, but you know something?  Wow.  It blew me away. 
[00:07:30]  It floored me.  Yeah, yeah.  It floored me.  I was done.  It floored me.  Cooked, spent.  It's over.  I saw so many teary eyeballs.  I don't give a crap.  I was, like, tearing up.  Who wasn't?  Who wasn't?  But then I'm like...  I start bubbling.  I'm so pissed off that I don't think we're killing enough people.  I, quite frankly, do not believe this country's killing enough people.  Killing enough of those filthy animals.  Because it got very personal. 
[00:08:00]  It got very personal at the end of the U2 show last night.  That was the only way they could end it, though, I thought.  In a way that hasn't been done before, you know?  Right.  So it really brought it home, and it just made me more angry.  I left the concert pissed off.  I was pissed.  I think that's good.  And then I'm walking through Times Square.  I think you need stuff like what happened at the end of that show last night to make sure you never forget.  You're right. 
[00:08:30]  Because that, you know, just when we're getting a little numb to what happened here in New York,  U2, you know, shows you how serious it is and how personal it really was.  It is.  You know something?  I walked back from the garden up to here through Times Square, and I was even more pissed off.  I wanted to start kicking over tables.  Every shill game that's going on, every piece of crap person that decides they don't want to get a god-effing job  and hawk their crap on the streets of New York City, 
[00:09:00]  have their tables laid out with the frigging photos of the World Trade Center and the flags,  and none of them are goddamn Americans.  They are capitalizing on the tragedy.  I don't care if, well, people would like a picture of the World Trade Center or something.  They're out there with tables full.  Now, all of them feature the World Trade Center.  You want your caricature drawn?  How about we draw it in front of the World Trade Center now? 
[00:09:30]  You've never been to a big city?  You see the guys that have the spray cans, spray paint, and they paint the planets and the galaxies, and it looks cool.  Yeah, but where are you going to hang that?  Exactly.  A crap.  When you're walking to the trade, oh, that's all.  The guy's good with the spray can.  Yeah, but I wouldn't, like, stop, buy one, and hang it up to my house when I get home.  Well, now they've replaced the unicorn flying in front of the planet with all of a sudden,  oh, the World Trade Center is in the galaxy now,  because they all got to exploit a little piece of the tragedy, and it disgusted me. 
[00:10:00]  I was walking back disgusted with these people.  What about the chinkies that can, like, make the butterfly into letters and stuff?  I think that's kind of neat.  Is that kind of neat?  They have little, like, butterflies and bugs, and it spells out your name.  It's pretty amazing.  It's pretty amazing.  In front of the World Trade Center, quite a talent.  But then, yeah, in the corner, it has to have, like, a, yeah, a World Trade Center thing.  I was walking back, and I was so angry that this one Asian woman,  I don't know what god-effing Asian country she stood.  Dude, I yelled at a few of them.  No crap.  And I think a lot of people in New York, and I give you guys a lot of credit, 
[00:10:30]  did the same thing that I did.  Yeah.  Because at first, they were showing, they were showing,  they were selling pictures of the World Trade Center, you know, in flames.  Yeah, yeah.  In flames.  Yeah, yeah, great.  Framed and everything.  And I lost it one day going to the subcrumbs.  Jack off.  Remember I said I should have said something, and I didn't?  I pushed out, and I admitted it on the air.  Then I saw it again.  I'm like, look, I can't push out again.  I let this lady have it.  Next time I saw her, I'm not saying I was the one.  Well, hopefully a bunch of people did that.  Probably enough people said something, though, that they felt the pressure, 
[00:11:00]  and all of a sudden they're not selling the ones that are on fire anymore,  and now they're just selling the ones that just show the World Trade Center.  You know why?  Because I know myself, I feel very strongly about what happened,  and I know damn well I'm not alone.  You know, it's affected me, and I carry an anger around with me all the time.  You know what I mean?  I'm pissed off.  And then to walk down the street and see some Asian woman or a guy from Egypt,  I don't know where, or even just your run-of-the-mill, 
[00:11:30]  I can't figure out what the hell you are,  selling the American flags at their tables along with the pictures of the World Trade Center.  I know they're not doing it because they care if people are patriotic, Harry Flags.  They care if people want to remember the Trade Center and what it stood for and everything.  I know they're not selling it because they give a flying F about this.  They're selling it to turn a buck, to exploit the tragedy for their own means,  and I am so pissed off at this that I swear to God, I don't know how many times I said, 
[00:12:00]  get the F, I used the F word, get the F away from me when these people,  who now because tourism's down, is approaching everyone on the street with a vengeance.  They're walking right up to you while you walk by and go,  flags, flags, picture, picture.  And I was saying, just get the F away from me.  It pissed me off.  And the fact that I had just left the U2 show with a tribute like that,  it angered me to no end.  And that's how I'm feeling.  It brought it right back to how we were feeling a month and a half ago.  Right, exactly. 
[00:12:30]  I've got to tell you guys, man, what Ant and I are doing,  we're really trying to do, this is kind of a distraction what we're doing.  It is still really, really close to our hearts what happened.  And I think U2, you know, they reminded me of that last night.  I was like, oh my God, I'm losing it.  All of a sudden, I was feeling the same way as when I was watching the TV.  Then I started feeling guilty, like, man,  and we've been spending the last month, month and a half trying to make people laugh.  I started feeling guilty because I'm like, wow, look how real this still is. 
[00:13:00]  Well, I understand, you know,  and I think a lot of people do what we do here on a daily basis.  It's what everyone's doing out on the street, too.  You're still hanging out with your friends.  You're still bullcrapping.  You're still making jokes and stuff.  But then there's those moments where it's amazingly real and very recent still.  You know what I mean?  And it angers me.  I carry around an anger.  Your brother wants in on this.  He's saying you're wrong.  That's what makes America America, capitalism.  But these people are like the bottom. 
[00:13:30]  Joe in the head.  They're the bottom feeders of capitalism.  Capitalism.  I agree.  And listen, man, just listen for a second.  I agree with everything you're saying.  Yeah.  Everything you're saying.  Because people that sell swag on the street,  whether it be representative of America or not,  are doing it because that is the society that we are.  We're a capitalist society.  It's part of what makes America great.  You know what?  They're probably...  Right. 
[00:14:00]  You're right.  But there are probably 18 billion things they could sell on their crappy little tables  that ain't going to piss me off walking by.  You're right.  That's what I'm saying.  In that respect, you're right.  And I'll tell you one thing.  If a war veteran or a firefighter or something was sitting at one of those tables selling flags,  selling even pictures or something and giving money to one of the causes,  that's fine, too, because you know damn well they care about what happened.  But these people, I look in their face and I'm like,  they could give a flying F if the building they're next to falls down, 
[00:14:30]  as long as they could turn a buck on it.  And that's what pisses me off.  It isn't the people who are selling it.  It's the retards that are buying it.  If nobody bought them, they wouldn't sell them.  Joe, if that's what you mean, the whole supply and demand thing, sure.  But I just can't see...  No, I'm not going to sit here and go, well, it's the American way.  You know, technically, sure.  It's going to piss us off, man.  It's going to piss us off.  But I swear to God, I wanted to kick a table over.  Yeah.  All right.  How was the show?  It was unbelievable.  Kicked the ass. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  All right, Joe.  All right.  Later on.  Thank you.  Let's go to Paul.  Hey, Paul, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  How are you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  Hey, man.  Oh, man.  I've been on hold so many days trying to get through to you guys.  I was at Baltimore for the U2 show last week.  Yeah.  Without rolling it for everybody, it was the most touching day I ever saw.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah.  And it was so simple, too.  That's what I liked about it.  You know?  Yeah.  I mean, the stadium was just silent.  Everybody was just staring.  Yeah.  It was great. 
[00:15:30]  You guys are the best, man.  I wish I'd tried to get tickets to the road show in Philly, and I missed out.  Yeah.  Seeing those pictures, it just makes you want to have been there.  Well, that's why we try to, you know, put as many pictures up on opiananthin.com so you  guys be part of what we're doing, man.  Yeah, and it's Boobalander, that Boobalander contest?  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, it's hilarious.  I hope the pictures, you know, do the contest justice.  We'll have more ladies coming in today.  Thanks, Paul.  Is Norton there?  Yeah, he just arrived.  He did.  Tell him I said hi, and Delaware loves him.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  You guys rock.  Take care.  All right. 
[00:16:00]  There you go.  Let me go to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  Anthony, stop ranting, for Christ's sake.  Yo, enough goddamn suspense.  What happened at the U2 concert?  It's not a whodunit.  Tell us already.  What happened at the end?  Yeah, come on.  Turn off your radio if you're going tonight.  I want to hear now.  What else?  A lot of stations have already said it.  Oh, all right.  Well.  Come on.  Come on.  All right.  Well, you know what?  If you don't want to hear this, you go on the show.  Just, you know, go away for a couple minutes.  We're not that paranoid about our listenership. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Go away and come back in like 10 minutes.  It's not a huge thing or anything.  It's like Ope said.  It's simple.  It was very simple.  It was so effective.  All right, Chris.  We'll explain it.  I assume most people turn their radio dial, okay?  Yeah.  Turn radio dial.  They got screens, video screens pretty much.  These long rectangular screens that kind of rise up.  They're only about 10 feet high and about 50 or 60 feet long. 
[00:17:00]  Rise up behind them.  And during certain parts of the show, they were able to just put video clips or just wacky colors and stuff.  It was really cool.  I think it was a great...  A snippet of the Martin Luther King speech was really cool, man.  That was cool.  That was in the middle of what?  Pride?  Yeah.  In the name of love, right?  And it's great how the bands have gotten away from just massive light setups above the band and the follow spots.  We're talking about you, too.  Ben and I talked about this in the back office.  I'm so glad they have finally decided to go back to their roots a little bit and strip down their live show.  Because that live show was getting absolutely out of control. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  It was ridiculous.  You forgot you were at a concert.  I know.  There was so much going on.  Oh, yeah, and a band's playing.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, hey, let's go see what's going on in Russia.  Let's go talk to the president tonight.  Let's do this.  Yeah.  There's a huge lemon over the audience.  They stripped it down nice.  It was nice.  And I like they got more high tech with the lighting effects because it wasn't just massive amounts of lights.  Like I said, they had these video things that rose up behind the band.  And all the lighting they had, most of it was effect lighting to throw something onto the crowd or onto the ceiling. 
[00:18:00]  During both the blue sky, Bono with just a high-powered flashlight, really.  Yeah, looking around.  It brought me back to Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  Yeah.  Relax.  Don't do it.  Remember when you had the flashlight?  And then he got the AIDS, Norton.  As he should have.  The one thing before we tell everyone what happened at the end of the show there,  the one thing that we have to give up on as far as going to concerts,  the fake show's over.  Good night.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:18:30]  They got to come up with something else.  And I'm not blaming you, too.  Every band in America does.  The encore.  That's it.  Well, look, we're throwing our drumsticks.  It's over.  It's over.  And then you said.  And they waved goodbye and stuff.  Well, okay.  I guess you guys, you know, cheered so much, we got to come back and do a few more.  Yeah.  Like, God, they cheered.  They came out again.  Oh, boy, good thing they were.  We wouldn't have come out.  Well, look.  They were cheering.  There's already, you know, another five songs on the band's set list they still got to play. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Check and Yankee chants.  Yeah, the Yankee chant was ignored the hell out of me.  Yeah.  So they have these video.  Go time it back, by the way.  Monitor things.  Thank God.  But, no, they got to get rid of the, you know, the fake, we're done.  Yeah, we're done.  We're doing our encore.  Then they come back out.  And they do it twice.  It's like, I want to sit here waiting.  Right.  So the video.  Sorry.  Because you're right.  Yeah, because you're sitting there, like, waiting.  And you want to just hear more music.  It's like, look, you guys are great. 
[00:19:30]  We know it.  You know it.  Keep playing.  We'll give you all the adulation you want when you're done.  Right.  I always forget that they're going to do an encore.  And I'll always, like, I see Sabbath every year.  And I'm like, wow, they didn't do Paranoid this time.  I thought no.  Oh, I thought for a second I weren't going to do it.  It's like you go see Skinner and, hey, it looks like they're done.  And they didn't play Freebird this time.  They're not going to do Freebird, I guess.  Oh, well, I guess, you know, they're bored with the song and they're moving on.  Yeah.  Then we clap a little when they do it. 
[00:20:00]  Well, you got to like the lighters.  That means Freebird's on the way.  Yeah.  So they got these video monitors that rise up behind the band.  And then what song was playing?  One.  Yeah.  One was playing.  And all of a sudden you see American Airlines, Flight 11 behind them.  That's all they say.  American Airlines, Flight 11.  And that's behind them.  And everyone starts cheering.  Like crazy.  Then it starts scrolling.  All the people that died on Flight 11.  All the crew and passengers it shows. 
[00:20:30]  And all the names.  Here it is.  How about that bringing you some personal, very personal.  And then all the other flights.  No one pissed me off.  They cheered louder for the Pennsylvania flight.  Well, they were.  Did you notice that at the end?  You know why?  They were cheering for that guy's name pass.  I can't remember it all.  Jeremy something.  Oh, was that when they cheered?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought they cheered when they showed that flight.  Like that flight, you know, was more important than the others.  Yeah.  Well, you know what it is?  It's that's the flight that was taken over by the passengers.  I understand why. 
[00:21:00]  But it was just a little weird.  People have their reasons.  Well, this disaster is a little more important in my brain than the other ones.  It was just they were cheering, I guess, the passengers.  Whatever.  I'm getting picky, but I thought that was a little strange.  But all the other flights from that day.  Scrolling like movie credit.  Yeah.  Like just all of a sudden they show the flight, the airline, and then it would scroll up.  And now you're looking at real people's names.  You know what I mean?  Names.  And then after the flight scroll, you see NYPD.  Wow. 
[00:21:30]  Place goes bullcrap.  Just out of their minds.  It didn't go.  Dead silence.  Yeah.  That's what you mean to say.  Yeah.  Well, there was.  I mean, they cheered.  Yeah.  And then it was like, whoa.  Dead silence as nicknames of the cops scrolled by.  Then FDNY comes up on the screen.  Oh, boy.  Huge.  And here's what killed me.  That scrolled forever.  The names of the firefighters forever kept scrolling. 
[00:22:00]  The song ended.  It kept scrolling.  Well, because then they went in to walk on.  Right.  And it was just hundreds of names.  And the hair was standing on my arm.  It was very hard to sit through and watch.  And when I left, I was just, I was pissed.  Because it brought the whole personal aspect of it right home.  Looking at individual names.  You couldn't look at all the names.  There were just too many. 
[00:22:30]  But as you're scanning them.  Because they had like three or four columns going through the whole length of the songs.  Right, right.  And you'd scan it and you'd just pop on a name.  And then you'd scan all the names and you'd pop on another name.  And you'd realize, you know, that's a guy.  Okay.  There's a guy.  Was he running up the stairs?  Was he, you know, having a hose on his back?  Is he thinking he's going to go up there and help people, you know?  And you look at another name and you're like, what was that person thinking?  And it made it very personal. 
[00:23:00]  And it was a great, great tribute to the people.  And it sure brought out a lot of emotion.  And naive me, I'm walking out and I'm like, well, why didn't they do it for all the, you know,  the regular people that just went to work that day?  We'd still be there.  That's what someone said.  Exactly.  They would have to scroll names, no joke, for the whole concert.  You could still be there.  For the whole concert.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it was amazing to watch the reaction from everybody. 
[00:23:30]  I thought it was pretty cool because, like, you know, as men, you know, if you're upset about something,  it's not really cool to show emotion in front of other men.  You know, that's just it.  At that show last night, when that happened, men all around us, they could care less who was looking at them.  They're not hiding it.  It was just like, this is so heavy duty.  Yeah.  I don't give a crap.  I'm not going to try to hold it in.  I'm going with this emotion.  I thought that was pretty damn cool.  I defy anybody that was there not to shed a little tear there. 
[00:24:00]  It was just very, very emotional.  And then, like I said, I just got pissed.  Yeah.  I don't know what to do.  Brought the concert to a bummer, though, because we were rocking.  It was like.  We were rocking.  And then they end and walk off off the stage.  And it's like, you know, they're not coming back after that.  You know, what are you going to do?  Start hitting us in the face?  You know, it's the only way you're going to come back from that with something more emotional. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  So that was it.  And then everyone walks out just going like.  I'm pissed.  Yeah.  I was all right with it, though.  Hey, we got the Mike Moran thing again.  We're going to try to talk to him today.  Yeah.  The firefighter that got up.  What show is this?  What tribute show?  At this point, I can't keep track.  It's the one at the garden.  The garden show.  And Mike Moran said it all for everyone.  In the spirit of the Irish people, Osama bin Laden. 
[00:25:00]  You can kiss my royal Irish ass.  There you go.  And the place went nuts.  Unfortunately, we don't have the cheers because that would be stupid.  Well, also, Hillary at that event getting booed.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Well, she showed up at the VH1 Fashion Awards.  In front of all this elite models and Hollywood jack-offs and golf-ball-eyed Susan Sarandon. 
[00:25:30]  And, gee, look at that.  She got a standing ovation at the VH1 Fashion Awards.  It's a get-up that looks like she just walked off the Continental Congress.  That was awful.  She looks like...  She did.  She looked like Shirley Partridge.  You know, we should make...  All this frill and stuff.  We should do a comparison here.  Oh, yeah.  Because this is how divided we are.  In front of blue-collar people.  Yeah, in front of real people.  Real blue-collar... 
[00:26:00]  Real people.  She gets booed.  This is the reaction she got.  Because she's a phony.  Yeah, the boo.  This is what she got.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  For being here tonight.  Thank you for supporting New York.  Thank you for your generosity on behalf of all the people who are going to need help for a long time to come.  Now, it's my great pleasure to introduce a video from someone who has a lot to say about New York and couldn't be here tonight. 
[00:26:30]  Please join me in welcoming Jerry Seinfeld.  All right.  So, that's the reaction she got in front of real people.  In front of firefighters and cops and real people that were at this event that see her for the phony she is.  And how she's there for photo ops.  And she's been anti-cop.  That was her campaign.  She's despicable. 
[00:27:00]  And then she gets in front of...  By the way, we piss off a lot of people when we talk bad about Hillary.  We know you're out there.  You know, that's fine.  I don't care.  I don't care if you don't agree with us.  We're not trying to convince you.  This is how we feel.  Of course they're going to write.  I've gotten letters from people that say, oh, my God, you're a Republican.  Like, no, I'm not a Republican.  Just because you point out someone being a phony like Hillary doesn't mean you put me on the other side of the coin.  I'm a pretty free thinker.  I think there are plenty of Republicans that are ass-wipes myself. 
[00:27:30]  And plenty of Democrats that are.  So, we understand you're getting pissed off.  We don't care.  This is how we feel.  Right.  I'm not trying to convince you, all right?  No.  So, now, here's the reaction she got in front of, in our opinion, a bunch of phony people.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  They're all standing and clapping.  Thank you so much.  That's good.  Woo.  They're wooing for us.  Woo.  Thank you. 
[00:28:00]  Fake people.  Thank you.  Oh, look.  They got louder and louder.  Thank you so much.  Pony.  I am so delighted to be here.  And I do have to tell you, though, when VH1 called and asked me to come, I thought for  just a minute that I might be getting the Lifetime Achievement Award for wearing black  pantsuits.  But instead, I'm here to celebrate all of you.  Shut up.  Thank you.  Thank you for whatever. 
[00:28:30]  For blah, blah, blah.  I like those people because they're really good.  Because if you wear fur, they'll throw like a little cream pie on you.  I can't stand her phoniness.  And then she gets up like that in front of those phony, fake people.  People that don't even know what it's like to live life as a real human being in their  gated house with their people that do their stuff for them. 
[00:29:00]  They don't have to deal with real people.  They don't know what it's like.  So, of course, they're applauding Hillary.  Hillary's doing this work, I guess, they think they're doing for helping people to make  their conscience feel better.  She opened with a good joke, though.  Yeah, it was strong.  Yeah, it was strong.  All right, we got to move on.  So, the comedy begins next.  I hope so.  There's a guy in the line who goes, how does Tom Brokaw feel about the vendors on the street?  He wants a joke.  Well, you know, we'll see if we get Tom Brokaw in here next. 
[00:29:30]  I want to hear from, I don't even know what to call it.  The new character.  Look at us breaking down the third wall.  I thought it was real, but I thought it was two ages too fast.  The email went nuts on that.  I got the progeria.  Is that what it's called?  Yeah.  Yeah, and I'm a nine-year-old boy, and I got the body of a 96-year-old.  Because I got progeria, you might have seen me on Geraldo, or Sally, Jesse, Raphael.  They're real great people.  They're very friendly, and they helped me right up until the end credits rolled. 
[00:30:00]  Then they threw me back out on the streets.  So he'll be stopping by from time to time today, okay?  Fascinating.  And McFoley coming by.  Ladies coming by for the Boobo Lantern Contest.  And we have a Cipro song.  Where's the Cipro song?  Let's play the Cipro song.  The new drug of choice as we go to break here.  Remember when it was Vicodin?  A little Cipro song.  Manic Larry sent this in to us.  I want to give him a little credit. 
[00:30:30]  Manic Larry?  Manic Larry.  And any time now, it'll queue up.  All right, we'll be back.  Check this out.  Open up your mail and we're all going to die.  Open up your mail and we're all going to die.  Cipro may not be holistic, taking extra doses.  But it's the only drug that kills the anthrax in your nose.  It's Bin Laden and his kooky gang.  Our town had crazy psychotics.  For breakfast, lunch, and dinner, we all eat an ibionics.  Open up your mail and we're all going to die. 
[00:31:00]  Open up your mail and we're all going to die.  The junk mail you've been getting could be from the Taliban.  I'll never enter sweepstakes that I get from Ed McMahon.  This anti-scare has made us all a bunch of nervous wrecks.  Just wear your gloves and masks when you get letters from FedEx.  Hey!  Sending anthrax in our mail will never be forgotten.  Now tell Blue Cross you need this drug and fill it to Bin Laden.  Cipro may not be holistic, but we must be conscious. 
[00:31:30]  It kills those nasty spores so that you won't feel so damn nauseous.  Cipro kills those spores so that you won't feel so damn nauseous.  Cupid.  The award-winning Opie and Anthony show.  This has got to be a joke, people.  Hey, geeky, geeky.  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Black Crow soul singing.  We're going to be talking to Chris Robinson when we broadcast live in Boston Monday and 
[00:32:00]  Tuesday next week.  Yeah.  We're hosting the Grave Rave.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Hey, John, what's going on today?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  I was wondering if you could do the impression of the auction guy on TV, so and so.  I think that'd be great to hear.  But that was his name again? 
[00:32:30]  Uh, Don West.  Where the hell did he end up?  He got fired.  Did he get fired or quit and think he was going to go on to something better?  I think he got fired.  There's a guy who had a great gig.  You've seen him.  It's 2.30 in the morning, 3 in the morning.  You flip through the channels.  There's Don West selling his baseball carts.  My baseball carts.  Look at the deal we got for you right now.  Look at this deal.  You can open up your own goddamn card store. 
[00:33:00]  Open it up.  Give me three minutes on the clock.  Three minutes left to get this deal.  And he'd start screaming until the three minutes ran out.  And then he'd say, if you bought that last batch, you were an ass.  Because the one we're bringing out now puts that to shame.  You wasted your money.  But if you're watching now, this is when you've got to buy.  We got Cipro.  We got Cipro.  Everyone heard of the anthrax. 
[00:33:30]  We're all hearing about anthrax.  You open up your mail.  You're going to get the anthrax.  Where are you getting the Cipro?  You can get it here from me, Dan West.  And we send it in a social rookie card.  Open up your own pharmacy with this deal.  We're getting the open up your own pharmacy deal.  You get the Cipro.  And we throw in the AZT if you got the hips.  You can snort your mail and have anal without a worry. 
[00:34:00]  No worries.  No worries.  No worries.  Look at me.  Okay, watch.  I'll open this up.  I'm pouring out anthrax spores.  All right.  I just snorted anthrax spores.  Anthrax spores.  Anthrax spores.  Snorted them right up.  Yeah, this could mean certain F.  Here it is, my Cipro.  Look, I got my Cipro.  And you can, too. 
[00:34:30]  Open up your own pharmacy.  Open up your own pharmacy.  Be dialing, people.  Give me three minutes on the clock.  What do you mean we don't have any Cipro left here?  Look, I just snorted anthrax.  We sold it all, Don.  I snorted anthrax.  You did such a great job.  We sold all the Cipro, though, Don.  Look, I'm not feeling very good.  And I had anal with a gay Haitian.  Where's my AZT? 
[00:35:00]  Where's my AZT?  Where's my...  Well, Don, you all right?  I'm feeling pretty bad.  I thought we had some in stock.  People, stop dialing.  Stop dialing.  If you did receive some of our Cipro, could you mail it back to Don West?  Care of Home Shopping Network.  What the hell is this on my hand?  It's festering. 
[00:35:30]  I knew...  You know something?  I knew we shouldn't have done this.  I could sell it without having to snort the anthrax.  People, please be giving me back this Cipro.  Ow.  You're amazing.  And we'll send you a Ben Laden rookie card.  When he was just a little terrorist.  Who knew he was going to be this big?  Get in on the bottom floor.  Be dialing now. 
[00:36:00]  We'll let you sponsor a bomb.  Get your Cipro.  Get your AZT.  Sponsor a bomb.  Sponsor a bomb.  Sponsor...  Don, you all right?  I'm feeling pretty bad.  I think it went right into my lungs.  What happens when anthrax gets into your lungs?  I'll be okay, right?  Uh.  Uh. 
[00:36:30]  There you go, you ass.  Thank you, Don West.  It hurts my throat in real life.  Don't make me do it no more.  Or I can't do the little kid with the progeria.  Jim Mint Tan Cipro.  No, we'll save that little song for a little later, Rick.  They don't want to blow out all our cute little bits right off the bat. 
[00:37:00]  Of course not.  Got to spread them throughout the show.  So we can have a well-balanced radio show for everybody.  I'm sweating.  I know.  Very good.  I thought my head was going to explode.  Hey, kids.  You want a syndication update?  Oh, oh, oh.  Syndication update?  Syndication update.  Doing very well in a lot of cities.  And we're stinking up to join in a few other cities.  Stinking it up.  One of those places we're stinking it up really bad is Chicago. 
[00:37:30]  On a lovely station called WCKG, they decided to pick up the Opie and Anthony show.  We thought they'd be motivated and they would promote it and help us, you know, help us make the show successful.  Right.  They're doing absolutely nothing.  They put us on from 9P to 1A, but we're like, okay, you know, there's a bunch of people on that station.  Right.  And this is what they got for us.  Okay.  We understand that.  This place is a nightmare. 
[00:38:00]  And no one will talk to us.  No one will talk to us.  So we sit there and do nothing.  Well, the ratings absolutely blow.  Horrible.  And it burn me knees.  Horrible.  Horrible.  They could probably save money if they turned off the electricity instead of run our show in Chicago, okay?  Yeah.  Now, we pitched and complained about WCKG yesterday, didn't we, Ann?  We did.  Well, most likely the small amount of listeners we do have in Chicago did not hear us pitching about Chicago yesterday. 
[00:38:30]  Because our show was preempted in Chicago.  Preempted?  Now, Jim Norton, you don't see the email in front of me.  Would you like to guess why we were preempted in Chicago?  No.  I'm going to guess, and we didn't discuss this before, I'm going to guess it was some type of a sporting event.  All right.  That's always good.  Good, good, good, good.  That Chicago is quite a sports town.  Good. 
[00:39:00]  Let me see.  Now, and a bunch of our listeners from Chicago, the small army that we do have in Chicago, they think we're making fun of the city.  Not at all.  We want to be on in Chicago, and we will be on in Chicago, and we will be successful in Chicago when we figure out this whole mess.  We don't like the station we're on because they don't give a flying F about the O.P. and Anthony show.  Is it safe to say they stink?  We were preempted last night for a hockey game. 
[00:39:30]  Wait a minute.  A hockey game.  Hockey?  Pretty popular sport.  Look, I'm wearing my Islanders hat today.  I see that.  Isn't it preseason, or is it...  No, it's the regular season.  But what game?  Well, it wasn't the Blackhawks, Anthony.  You're right.  No, it wasn't an NHL game that we were preempted for.  Wait a minute.  We were preempted in Chicago last night for minor league hockey.  The AHL. 
[00:40:00]  Minor league hockey.  Now, let me tell you something.  AHL, great league if you don't have the NHL in town.  Uh-huh.  Chicago has the NHL.  Sure do.  So, what kind of interest could there possibly be in an AHL hockey team?  Not only that, who's listening to it on radio?  You know what I mean?  Who?  And the email came in.  Dick just preempted for...  Tony.  Subject.  WCKG sucks. 
[00:40:30]  My name is Tony from Chicago.  I really like your show a lot.  There's one thing, though.  WCKG is doing now that...  There's one thing they're doing now that it's hockey season.  And that is they effing preempt your show on Wednesday and Friday.  So, this wasn't a one-time thing.  To bring us Chicago Wolves hockey.  That's right.  AHL hockey.  Then we catch maybe two hours of the show.  Then they cut to some freaks. 
[00:41:00]  Name John and Jay.  I'm not going to abuse these guys.  I have no clue.  Is there any way that you guys can make them play your entire show after the stupid hockey game at least?  Oh, brother.  Thanks, dudes.  Keep up the great work when I get to hear you.  Mark, WCKG sucks.  Those effing A-holes.  It's bad enough WCKG in Chicago runs the show from 9 to 1 a.m.  But tonight, I tune in for a little O&A.  And the pricks are airing a minor league hockey game instead of you guys.  They're not even a goddamn sports station. 
[00:41:30]  Minor league hockey.  Great.  How are those CKG wow stickers?  Are they good?  I don't know.  Yeah, well, that was the guy they fired.  Look at Ray from Whitestone.  CKG.  Worse than the original N.E.W.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're getting preempted for minor league hockey.  If that doesn't tell us you really don't give a flying F about this radio show, I don't know what else to tell you.  Yeah, we cannot.  So call up Ken Stevens and either work this out or let's just move on. 
[00:42:00]  We can move on.  Other stations are already calling.  We'll just move on.  Yeah.  Plus, they edit the show when, you know, we make fun of them.  So just give the word.  So Chicago won't even hear this rant either.  Give the word and we'll be happy to kick your ass at another station in the appropriate time slot.  Happy to just kick your ass.  I think this show is a little better than minor league hockey.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Just a little better.  I don't want to pat ourselves on the back too much, but I think I can say that one.  I think more people would rather hear some of the various hijinks and shenanigans, Norton.  And antics.  And some antics that go on on this show rather than listening to minor league hockey.  But, hey, who are we?  We're just on-air talent.  We don't know the ins and outs and the fine working points that management, they might have a grand plan that we can't possibly. 
[00:43:00]  That's embarrassing.  And we're trying to build up the show in syndication and it reflects badly on us.  We get the ratings out and all of a sudden, you know, we suck and then we find out that we're being preempted for minor league hockey.  It's not good for us.  You know, Jason from Jersey says that in D.C. we're preempted for minor league football, the Redskins game.  Very funny.  We could all laugh at that, right, Washington?  Minor league hockey.  Great.  So that's the latest there. 
[00:43:30]  Thank you, Chicago.  Yeah, thanks for the support.  And then where's the other one that was really funny?  It's more San Francisco abuse.  True.  What, what, what, what, what, what?  Jeff from Line 1 National.  Let me go.  Jeff, what's going on?  Well, I just want to talk about Rush Limbaugh.  He went on today for about two minutes with the buzzing of a disconnected phone line in his ear and didn't hear it.  He just kept talking and talking. 
[00:44:00]  He can't hear anything.  Jeff, you're kidding, right?  No, I'm serious.  Come on.  That is too much.  We've all heard Rush Limbaugh says he's losing his hearing.  Right.  He's pretty much totally for, uh, uh, uh, he's deaf.  He's deaf.  And now he's trying to do his show.  So people have to write what the callers are saying.  Right.  And hold it up to him.  Right.  And then he could comment on it.  And we found out through Jeff that he, he left the dial tone on during one of his calls.  Thank you, Jeff. 
[00:44:30]  You're welcome.  Hey, do we have, uh, the pretender so we can do this right?  Yeah.  Where is that?  Because I would love to know what that sounds like.  Other radio shows would have to run with this after the show and produce it nicely.  Oh, we don't care.  We just go on the fly.  That is terrible.  I don't know how he does that.  You know, I mean, we kind of know how a radio show works.  You have to be able to hear stuff that's going on, especially with a show like his, political.  You're taking calls.  You're interviewing guests. 
[00:45:00]  Macca to the MacNimbato.  Habit and hearing on love from God.  It's the MacNimbato.  Today, we're going to be talking again about what airs like the Democrats more.  Bill?  Hello?  It's someone.  Hello?  Hey, Rush.  Hello?  Rush, Rush. 
[00:45:30]  Am I on the air?  It's the MacNimbato.  Rush!  Wait, wait, my producer's having me know.  Someone is saying what?  Rush!  Oh, hello!  Hello!  What do you think of the bombing in Afghanistan thus far?  Rush!  What do you think of the bombing in Afghanistan so far?  What?  Okay, not so much.  What do you think about bombing in Afghanistan? 
[00:46:00]  Well, we have to tell people that we're not going to take this anymore.  We can't be here admitting to the people that we're born by and not be bound with a show of strength from the fabricant.  We are to...  Yes, of course I do.  And exactly what you...  If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.  That's a great question.  If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator. 
[00:46:30]  Okay, that's even a better comment.  I agree with you.  That is good stuff.  Yes, absolutely true.  We are the show that we are strong and that nobody can do this on.  But you know, the Democrats don't understand that we're not going to go over for a power.  What is that?  I'm handing another note.  Beep, beep, beep. 
[00:47:00]  What does that mean?  I just...  Hang...  Hang up the phone.  Hang...  Oh, hang up the phone!  Oh, thank you, Corma!  We'll be back when we're on the Matt Limbaugh, don't tell him I'm more for man!  And the demon!  What's none of this? 
[00:47:30]  I don't know how he can do it.  Ears on loan from God.  The Rush Limbaugh Show.  Wow.  I wonder if it was even close to that.  Did it get to that?  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam point.  We have to take another break, catch up here.  That's that you passed out with your girlfriend on the phone.  And you wake up to go, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  And it's still her talking.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  I want to make fun of San Francisco again today, but they're getting a little mad at us.  Are they?  West Coast Daybrights really fast because we have to take a break.  This will finish syndication news for today.  Let's see.  The station you're on has the real estate guys.  What?  Oh, those two.  Not the two midgets.  I don't think it's the midgets, though.  Maybe they could help us out.  But in San Francisco, we're on the same station as a show called the real estate guys.  Listen, I love those real estate shows where they get the people that go, with their help, 
[00:48:30]  I got me three biddings and I'm raking in about five grand a week.  Uh-huh.  You know, a talk show about real estate isn't a bad idea for an awful station that nobody listens to.  But KYCY takes it a step further by airing a show about selling real estate in the Los Angeles area about six hours away.  Thanks to the plan, I have $3,000 in positive cash flow. 
[00:49:00]  What?  Yeah, but those midgets were great.  The midgets were good.  The dogs that were just as tall as them?  They both had a hot blonde?  Yeah.  Hey, we're going to teach you how to buy real estate.  Hey, wait a minute.  I sound like the progerite kid.  All right.  We'll leave it at that with San Francisco today.  But, yeah, the real estate guys on the same station as us in San Francisco.  You can check them out at therealestateguys.com.  There you go. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  We have to take a break.  Booble Lantern Chicks, anybody stopping by yet?  Yeah.  Booble Lantern.  In a little while.  In a little while.  Good.  All right.  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I like it when this show's dirty.  Boston, we're coming.  Yeah.  Monday and Tuesday, live in Boston. 
[00:50:00]  A lot of people want to know if they can stop by the WBCN studios.  Hell, yeah.  Hell, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Crystal Meth, the name of the game.  They'll be playing at the Grave Rave that we're hosting.  We'll give away some more tickets in a little while.  You're welcome to come anywhere we show up.  Oh, I think so.  I don't think it has to be some invitation-only thing or anything.  If we're hanging out at the station, you want to come down and say hi.  Why would we want to keep anyone away? 
[00:50:30]  What's the name of the party you're doing?  Dave, I got a broadcast from somewhere.  They're going to be in town.  Hey, they're going to be in town when I'm doing a remote, Dave.  Let's make an invitation-only so they can't show up and undermine my show.  Oh, you tool.  What a pussy.  Rock Hole.  That's it.  And if you can't make it down to us, go see Rock Hole. 
[00:51:00]  Show them how great you think he is.  And this just in, Sacramento will be preempting the show today for a T-Ball game.  T-Ball?  Yes.  T-Ball catching on in Sacramento.  Wow.  Sacramento can take a joke, though.  We're on KXOA.  They like when we goof on them.  Sure.  San Francisco does not like when we goof on them.  No.  They get angry. 
[00:51:30]  Beeper ball?  All right.  Real fast.  Let's go to Rob.  Hey, Rob.  What's up?  Hey, Anthony.  Speaking of boogeymen, did you see Patty last night?  We wanted to bring this up at the beginning of the show, but then we got a little serious  with the whole end-of-show thing that you two did.  Was she with the edge?  Well, let's just put it this way.  We all saw Patty.  We all saw Patty because no matter how much I was assured by a few people around here  that her tickets were elsewhere than mine. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  I had Section 9.  I was in row J.  Okay.  Seat 5.  Patty had Section 9.  Row J.  Seat 4.  Seat 6!  So, as I'm looking at my ticket, I'm looking at the row, I see Patty, I'm like, uh-oh.  I must be way over here to the right.  I'm like, all right, J, uh-oh, uh-oh, Section 92.  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  I go, oh, my God, I'm right next door. 
[00:52:30]  Hey, Anthony.  What?  I was looking at the website because then I just saw the picture of Patty.  Yeah.  She looked like powder.  Powder, right.  You know what you're better with?  Remember, we ought to powder her up and take a picture.  All right, take it easy, guys.  Powder.  We'll do that.  Look at me.  Let's powder her up with some anthrax.  You're trapped in silverware.  I'm magnetic.  Anthony, I know you're pissed off that Patty was sitting right next to you, but before we  get to the bottom of this, I got to tell you, I turned around because she was sitting directly 
[00:53:00]  behind me.  Yeah.  Every time I turned around, she had the black plastic wig that she has to wear for the next  four to five months while her hair grows in, and she had the cute little cowboy hat your  girlfriend bought her.  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, the only thing I could think of is the kid with the adult disease.  Yeah, well, they usually wear the hats because, well, we got to wear the hats to keep our  eggshell-thin skulls from just cracking under the pressure of, you know, anything heavy 
[00:53:30]  like barometric pressure might just cave in my little head.  It's great.  It's like, you ever blow the yolk out of an egg?  That's my skull.  So we have to protect it with a hat.  Actually, the Make-A-Wish Foundation is hooking me up with Mayor Giuliani here in New York,  and he's sending me to the Yankee game.  Oh, he is.  He gave me the big Yankee hat.  Oh, he's going to send me to the World Series.  Nice.  Light bulb-like, fragile little head.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  And I'm going to be sitting right next to him.  Oh, yeah?  So I'm very thrilled.  I just hope it's a sweep because I don't think I can make it through five games.  Why can't you make it through five games?  I'm aging like a mayfly.  It's very difficult.  I'm only, I'm nine years old now.  I live my life like a normal child.  Yeah.  Except for the fact that I have the body of a 96-year-old man.  But I'm not bitter that I'm never going to have sex. 
[00:54:30]  It's pretty pathetic because you had the body of an 80-year-old when you started this break.  Yeah, that's great.  Look at, watch, I'll take my hat off, okay?  Yeah.  Now, look at my thin skull and my aged skin.  Turn the lights out.  Go ahead.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Hey, hey.  You can watch my synapse firing.  Look.  It's like a disco in my head.  Like a little disco.  Waffle fin.  A little something for all the God freaks out there. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Explain that one.  Well, I've accepted it.  God works in mysterious ways.  For some reason, he felt he had to give me bones like graham crackers.  But he works in mysterious ways.  And God knows when I drop dead within maybe six to ten hours, I'm really going to ask him what the hell this mysterious way was.  Because I don't know why I should walk around looking like one of those things that crawled out of the ship in Close Encounters.  Only not half as cute. 
[00:55:30]  But you have a normal life, right?  People send you skateboards and stuff.  I am a normal kid.  I like skateboarding.  I like bike riding.  And actually, Make-A-Wish Foundation, I'm going to be going backstage and meeting one of my favorites, Britney Spears.  Oh, really?  Which is fabulous.  It's great.  Yeah, fantastic.  I can really fantasize about getting a chick like that.  Nine years old.  I got the body of a 90-year-old.  And Britney could pretend that you're hot.  Yeah, Britney is going to sit me on her lap and look at me and use all of her acting abilities not to be disgusted and run away. 
[00:56:00]  And actually pat me on my little thin skull very gently.  It could crack in a breeze, I swear.  One time, I almost got a cerebral hemorrhage from a snowflake.  I didn't have my big hat on.  How was the U2 show last night?  That's fantastic.  The Make-A-Wish Foundation sent me backstage to meet Bono.  Yeah.  He shook my little hand and almost ripped it right off. 
[00:56:30]  It was great.  I think he had one too many dinners.  He thought he saw a leprechaun.  Freaked him out.  I freaked him out.  I went, ah, get away from me, pot of gold.  And he screamed, ran away.  He had to get him back on because he had a poor kid with a disease.  But you're a normal kid.  I'm a normal kid.  I just like, you know, I do normal things.  I skateboard.  I ride bikes.  And I wither away.  Oh, wait, no, that's not a normal kid.  That's me.  Thank you, God.  Thank you, God. 
[00:57:00]  I got Peoria.  What do I got?  Pejoria.  Pejorative.  No, Pejoria.  Pejoria.  Pejoria.  I'm only nine.  I shouldn't know big words like that.  You play your video games.  You got normal friends, right?  I like video games.  I got normal-sized friends.  And, boy, they love hanging out with me.  That's right.  I don't attract too much attention.  I don't get too many stares from other children.  Children, they're pretty acceptive of me. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's great.  We play in the playground during recess.  They run away from me, and I make believe I'm the Chucky doll.  It's quite frightening.  Ain't that right, Mikey?  There's one for New York.  And, you know...  I don't think I'm involved, Mikey.  And you get to go to Disney, and they... 
[00:58:00]  Oh, it's one thing I got to...  You know, I got to...  Well, I would take my hat off to the Make-A-Wish Foundation,  but something might happen and crush my thin little skull.  My little, thin, little skull.  You ever looking at a bird's nest?  Yeah.  And you see the baby bird, and they've got a big, thick skull and a little neck.  And I look like that peep, peep, look.  Peep, peep, peep, peep.  Look at me.  That big head.  But they bring you right to the front of the line down there.  I get right to the front of the line.  Nice.  But the only thing is, I get to the front of the line right up to the point  where that little cardboard cutout is standing there with a hand. 
[00:58:30]  You must be this high.  And I can't go on the right.  Because I'm not tall enough.  And if I ever went on Space Mountain, that first turn,  I believe my head would crack right off and fly into one of the cars that a people bull.  Uh, Pajerio?  Yes?  For New York, could you say Toyota?  Toyota?  That's right, Mikey.  I love the Mike and the Mad Dog show with my paroria.  Pajerio.  Pajerio.  Pajerio.  Pajerio.  Pajerio.  Mikey. 
[00:59:00]  I got the pejorative, Mikey.  Whatever it is.  Yeah, you got to give the guys a lot of credit coming back like that, Mikey.  In my aged body, we'll be back with the words from Pajerio.  Pajerio, boy?  Yeah, yes.  So you got tickets for what?  Game four?  Game four, I'm...  Yeah, it's, uh, for me, it's the drive to stay alive.  I call that.  You know, they're looking, you know...  I think it's a good thing the mayor did.  The drive to stay alive.  You look good in the Yankee cap. 
[00:59:30]  We look, uh, like twins next to each other with his big bulbous, uh, beluga whale sonar-equipped head.  And then mine.  But you're a normal kid.  Man, I'm a normal kid.  I like baseball.  Right.  I'm going to go out there, and actually, I'm just going to, um, I'm going to show myself to the players on the Diamondbacks.  Uh, uh, during crucial plays, and hopefully they're just going, oh, my God, what the hell is that?  And the ball will fall down.  I just hope they don't rip any foul balls near me, because even the breeze from one of those will, uh, crack my thin little saran wrap head. 
[01:00:00]  I see you got a baseball mitt on your left hand.  Yeah, because I play baseball.  Looks a little big.  I'm a normal kid.  Right.  I'm a normal kid.  Just because I, I look, with this, uh, baseball glove, I look like a fiddler crab.  Uh, it doesn't matter.  I look like a hermit crab out of a shell.  With a big mitt on one hand that I use to crack open crustaceans.  And I feed myself with them.  Crustaceans.  See?  L-Q-R-Y. 
[01:00:30]  That's right.  So you're looking to catch a foul ball, looks like.  No, what, you're crazy?  What?  It's like an anvil falling on me.  Foul ball?  You gotta be crazy.  A small child at the door looking in.  Is that mankind's kid?  Yeah, mankind's kid.  But you're a normal.  But I'm a normal kid.  You are.  I go about my life, even though I have a German dip.  I know that, um, I age quickly. 
[01:01:00]  And, um, yeah, let me look at my little watch on my thin, little, ready-to-crack-on hand.  Yeah.  Ooh, I got quite the life going.  Measured in seconds.  How long did it take you to go?  Never cough and die, guy.  How long did it take you to go through your 20s?  Ooh, when the show starts.  Ah, boy.  Joe, what's up?  Uh, you guys, you've reached a new low. 
[01:01:30]  I'll tell you what, I'll, uh, I'm gonna, I'll see you in hell, because I'm laughing my, my balls off.  Well, I'm just another kid.  Pejoria kid, what you said about God giving you bones like Graham Crackers?  Hey, man, everyone wants to, everyone wants, hold on, everyone wants to ask God a question, right, when they go?  Well, that's gonna be my question.  What the F is that about?  Why do you give me bones like Graham Crackers? 
[01:02:00]  Holy cow.  Every day, my birthday, it was definitely God's day off.  They put someone else in charge.  But, you know, I take it in stride, because I do have a great life.  I have great parents.  You're, uh, you're a normal kid.  I'm a normal kid.  I go, I go through my, uh, normal life.  I go to school.  Um, and, uh, yeah, just because, uh, my parents gasped in horror when I came out of the womb, it doesn't matter.  I know I have a normal life and loving parents.  Do they make you do your homework, because you're a normal kid?  Because I'm a normal kid, I do my schoolwork, because, boy, I really, uh, want to, uh, get an education, 
[01:02:30]  so I can get some career going when my body is, oh, 2,000 years old looking.  Why bother, I say.  Why bother?  That's why I like playing baseball.  But I'm a normal kid, so I'll keep going to school, uh, like it really means something to me.  You look like, uh, the turtle from the Bugs Bunny cartoon.  Don't I?  When he took his shell off?  Right.  In between when he took his normal shell off and put on that rocket-powered shell?  Hey, guys.  He won the race.  See?  That's something for me to look forward to.  Uh, yes, who's that?  Winning the race to death.  Maury Povich.  Maury Povich, what's up?  Listen, don't make fun of my meal tickets. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  Maury.  This bit sucked yesterday.  It sucks even worse today, you ass.  Thank you, Maury.  How come Maury was so nice to me when I was on his show?  Look, I look like a plucked oven stuffer roaster.  It's very dangerous around my house around Thanksgiving,  because once my mother actually basted me and put me in the oven.  Because I look like a turkey.  That thin, lumpy skin.  Now, by magic.  All right. 
[01:03:30]  Well, thank you.  Little Perdoria kid.  The kid from Peoria or something.  So, yeah, Stalker Patty was at the U2 show.  Yeah.  Sitting right.  Sitting right next to me.  Now, a lot of people think me and Opie get these tickets for free.  For some reason, people are under the impression that if U2's in town  and we want to go, that we're going.  We get backstage.  We get tickets.  No.  We bought tickets.  We bought these tickets.  And they were pretty expensive. 
[01:04:00]  Very expensive.  How much a pair?  $2.87.  $2.87 a pair.  Wow.  And the seat's not that good.  To tell you the truth.  I have some crappy seats.  I have a theory on that.  They have, like, the good section.  Yeah.  But every good section has the bad seats in that good section,  meaning they're almost in a worser section.  Yeah.  Get it?  Yeah, I know.  Okay, so we had the bad seats in the good section  almost near the worser section.  We're right on the border.  Oh, yeah.  So, one seat over, you pay $100 less. 
[01:04:30]  I would guarantee the guy next to you,  one seat over was in the worser section  and $100 less a ticket.  And I can only imagine that Earl has something to do with this  because he was in charge of getting the money, getting the ticket.  So, I don't know how, but I can only imagine in some way  somebody took advantage of Earl.  Because he's Earl.  And gave him crappy tickets.  But that's fine.  I don't care.  All I was told was, we were going to the show.  I didn't care.  I love you, too.  Let's go watch you, too.  I get my ticket.  I sit in my seat.  I'm assured that Patty's tickets are not next to ours. 
[01:05:00]  I am right next to Patty.  Not near her.  Next to her.  So, Ben looks at me and goes,  Dude, you talk to Earl about this  because I had nothing to do with this.  Earl gave the tickets out.  He knew where everything was.  Earl then arrives on the scene,  looks at me sitting next to Patty,  and goes,  Dude, I didn't say anything to Ben or Earl.  They just knew that I was going to be pissed.  You gestured to me.  You made the sign of getting my throat cut. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I did the thumb across the throat.  And then Earl instantly,  I had nothing to do with it.  Instantly, Earl points to Ben and goes,  He did it.  It's Ben's fault.  So I go,  Okay, you know something?  We will deal with this tomorrow.  Who was responsible for me paying top dollar for U2 tickets  and having to spend my evening next to Patty?  Who was it?  Earl.  No, it was not.  Who was it?  John can back me up. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  John can back me up.  John, the former dump guy.  The three, Ben, Earl, and I were in the same room together.  Earl took them out of the envelope,  handed me my two,  handed Ben his two,  and said,  These are for Opie.  These are for Anthony.  And we're giving these away.  Your story's already got holes in it  because Ben got four tickets.  He got holes in it.  Four to?  So?  Ben grabbed the tickets and he goes,  I want to sit in the best possible seat.  That's right.  I'm selfish, right?  Exactly.  With U2, it's his favorite band. 
[01:06:30]  Which is fine.  And he grabbed all the tickets and sorted them out.  Earl, did you know which tickets were going to Patty?  Yes, I did.  Did you know which tickets were going to me?  No, I did not.  How did you not know?  You had them all in.  You said,  These are for Ben.  These are for Opie.  These are for Anthony.  These are the giveaway ones.  Did you look at where they were  and notice the giveaway ones were exactly next to mine?  You didn't notice?  I did not notice.  You didn't try to notice,  even though you knew that  I didn't want to sit next to Patty for the whole show. 
[01:07:00]  I knew that,  but I gave it your tickets weeks ago.  Ben, you're completely off the hook.  Earl's fault.  Earl's fault.  How do you not accept responsibility for this?  Fine.  I give up.  Fine.  You're agreeing.  It's your fault.  I'm not agreeing,  but it's going to be my fault anyway.  It's kind of like a little date for you.  He's got to pay his penance.  Pick this.  I want to see you pick that.  I am not picking cotton. 
[01:07:30]  It's a bouquet of cotton.  Where the hell did you find that?  For some reason,  they were selling it on the streets.  You have to pay your penance.  I am not picking cotton.  What?  It's real cotton.  Where the hell?  You son of a bitch.  They're selling that on the streets of New York?  I don't know why they are,  but yeah,  they're selling cotton.  Come on, Earl.  I just want to see you pick a piece.  Hell no.  But you just do it once  and sing Old Man River.  Look, I'm doing it.  When you go right ahead,  I'm not going to pick it.  Pick some cotton.  Oh, look,  there's nothing wrong with picking a little cotton.  Pick a little cotton.  A little cotton.  You could even jump down 
[01:08:00]  and turn around before you do it.  Come on.  I am...  No.  Oh, come on.  It's all in fun.  Why are they selling bouquets of cotton?  Hey, I have no idea.  Day is never sitting.  Master got me working.  Sunday master set me free.  Come on, Earl.  It's either that or we hobble you  so you can't give me bad tickets again. 
[01:08:30]  No?  Just pick one.  No, I am not.  Come on.  I'm talking right back.  I am not picking cotton.  We all did.  Pick some.  All the guys are doing it.  Come on.  You're a sick ass.  Just pick a little out.  I just see you.  Jim picked one.  Jim picked one, yeah.  Come on, Earl.  That's his brother.  I want to see your melanin-laden fingers  just pulling some out.  I am not picking cotton.  All right.  All right.  Well, it's your fault.  Whatever.  It absolutely is.  How do you not see it? 
[01:09:00]  How do you not see that it's your fault?  You're saying whatever.  You were in charge of dealing out the tickets.  You knew which ones were mine.  Hi, Anthony.  Yeah.  Earl was at the U2 show last night.  Yeah.  We have some audio of Earl.  Oh, we do?  From his seat.  As he's watching U2.  All right.  Come on.  How about a good old nigger work song?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  I didn't know Blazing Saddles clips were coming out of Earl's mouth. 
[01:09:30]  Earl loves Blazing Saddles.  He admits it all the time.  It's a funny movie.  There you go, Earl.  Come on.  A line written by Richard Pryor.  Richard Pryor.  Right, Earl?  Very funny.  One of the head writers.  Okay.  Well, Earl, I don't see how you don't see it.  You dealt the tickets out.  You knew which tickets were going to who.  Yet, for some reason, you're not responsible for me sitting next to Patty.  Oh, I can't believe it.  This is wonderful.  That's all I'm hearing.  She keeps turning around and going, and this bride, I can't believe you, too. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, look at the judge.  She's upstairs, by the way.  The best was the normal guy she was with.  Yeah.  He was completely normal.  Oh, totally.  But I asked him when she wasn't paying attention, he's like, oh, I'm just here for the show.  Did you, at one point, pull Patty against you and press your firm member against her wilted, cancerous buttocks?  Oh, there is something in the water today, man.  We have just about insulted everybody.  Ralph, what's up? 
[01:10:30]  I swear to God, if he picks that cotton, I'm going to give five brothers from the projects and whip his ass.  I'm not touching that cotton.  You better not.  I swear.  Why are they selling cotton?  More importantly, why is it cotton?  Why are you just letting, listen, just take the cotton and throw it in the garbage.  All right.  Thank you, Ralph.  Ralph's a little mad, too.  But why are they selling cotton on the streets?  I don't know why they sell cotton on the streets.  It was some Asian guy.  It's not, it's, it's, it's, explain this. 
[01:11:00]  It's not just cotton.  You have to pick it.  It's a piece of a cotton plant.  And it's got all the little buds of cotton on it.  And you just kind of reach in and you pick one out.  Look at that.  There we go.  Boy, that's easy.  Don't even hurt your hands.  It's all the bitching about.  It's not even heavy.  I got to tell you, I didn't think it was so easy to do.  Yeah, look at that.  All right.  Cut it out.  Cut it out.  All right, listen.  McFoley has been waiting outside for a half hour. 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  He got here early.  So we're going to take a quick break.  And we're going to talk to mankind.  Cactus Jack.  McFoley next.  Okay?  All right, Ralph.  All right.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  And I'll see you at the 9th.  I forgot what year I was in there.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  And I'll see you at...  What is it?  I was supposed to say my name.

[01:13:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oi.  Still waiting for the boobalannan girls to show up for today.  Rick promised girls would show up today for this contest.  What's the matter, Rick?  They're coming.  They're coming, man.  Rick didn't spend his nights trolling the gay bars.  Perhaps we'd have some boobalannan chicks.  You hear this one, man?  Is he gay?  He doesn't like to admit it, but put it this way.  Let's just look at some of the evidence.  All right.  Let's take a look at it. 
[01:14:00]  He is married.  I'll give him that.  That's on that side.  She's a lovely girl.  Well, does that really matter these days?  I know.  It's called a beard.  You know what I mean?  But get the car, okay?  He drives a yellow Miata.  Ooh, that's a giveaway right there.  I know.  Come on.  You ever watch the movie Go?  I think Mick drives around on a yellow Miata.  Yeah, sure.  Right?  No, but I do watch the rent-a-movie Cruisin' quite a bit with Al Pacino.  Cruisin' with Al Pacino.  And then the other day...  That's a lot of records. 
[01:14:30]  Nice.  Not a great one.  79, I think?  Nice.  Fisting in the back room.  You know, uh...  Wait, wait, wait.  My daughter's over there, so...  Are insane.  You scared the crap out of me just now.  No, but you know what she did say the last time we were in New York City?  We're driving through here, going to WWE New York or whatever.  She goes, Dad, look!  Movies only 25 cents!  And I was like, um...  She goes, can we go see one?  I was like, oh, I don't know. 
[01:15:00]  And she goes, Dad, you always told us to look out for a good deal, and that's a good deal.  That's a good deal.  And she goes, I like scary movies.  Are they scary?  And I said, well, they could be.  I'm pretty sure some of them are.  And some of them very scary.  What a cute kid.  I'm out there in between breaks.  During commercials, they usually play a little...  It's Noel, right?  It's Noel, yeah.  They remember from the books.  Yes, of course.  Where's Dewey?  What's your favorite word?  Do you remember?  Oh, he put me on a little spot.  Begins with an N. 
[01:15:30]  Let me tell you the Wolfman story.  Let me tell you the Wolfman story.  We're in a little park up in the mountains of New Hampshire, and this old-fashioned train,  steam train, goes through the woods and goes across the river.  And the deal is, it's not just a steam train, right?  It was nice enough, but they have this guy dressed up, the Wolfman.  He's not actually dressed up.  His thing is, he's long and long hair and dirty.  I think I just described myself like that.  And then he pretends to chase the train and all that, and he's pretty scary.  And my kids are scared. 
[01:16:00]  And all of a sudden, he very rarely goes into the main part of the park,  but it turns out the Wolfman was a wrestling fan.  And so now, the guy who's just scared my kids is now taking pictures with their dad.  And on the way back to the hotel, she's going, Dad?  And I said, yeah.  And she goes, is the Wolfman going back to our hotel room with us?  I said, no, no, honey, he's not.  She said, is he going to eat dinner with us tonight?  I said, no, no, the Wolfman is not eating dinner with us.  And she said, is he going to come home with us?  I said, no, he's not. 
[01:16:30]  And she goes, yeah, because him couldn't get on the plane with him nipples showing.  Oh, my God.  And then the word nipple became her favorite word for about 15.  It's been mine for a long time as well.  Yeah.  And she actually speaks better English than Opie.  I didn't want to do anything bad, though, as we're playing foosball and stuff.  I'm just, ding, ding, the ball over there.  And she'll hit it back.  And then I would, ding, ding it back. 
[01:17:00]  Because, you know, Mick's sitting right there.  I didn't want to do one of those, wham shots in your face.  Take that to the bank.  You know.  I do it.  I jam on my kids.  I set the rim at eight feet so I can jam.  Because I'm 6'4", but I haven't come close to a regulation rim in about ten years.  And it's a regulation to them.  Makes you look good in front of your kids.  Look, daddy's Michael Jordan.  So are we going to blow off the Rick is gay thing, I guess?  No, no.  Is he off the hook?  No, let me hear some more.  Just the other day.  And he seemed to enjoy me talking about that man's nipples as well. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Today he comes in here and says that he accidentally, in the village, in Chelsea, here in New York,  accidentally walked into a gay bar with some gay friends of his over the weekend or something.  I don't know what it was.  I had one friend visiting from out of town and, you know, he wanted to go.  So I said I'd go for a few minutes.  I was with my wife and another very, very clean woman.  You know, that's how he said wife. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  It wasn't just I went with my wife.  I went with my wife.  Yeah.  And then we stayed for five minutes and went over to privilege for two hours.  He just kisses really good for a straight guy.  So the joke was on the gay guys that you were with that night because you're not gay.  Right.  So the joke was on them.  Exactly.  Let's not forget the gay crabs.  Let's not forget the gay crabs.  Gay crabs.  I love the gay crabs.  Rick got crabs from a gay guy.  And he insists there's no homosexuality.  But he didn't get it from the gay guy like he would get it from the gay guy. 
[01:18:30]  Right.  It was like by...  It was the gay guy was a friend of this girl I was dating this time.  The girl again.  Your bed was the carrier, right?  No, her bed.  Her bed was the carrier.  For some reason, she let this gay guy sleep in her bed.  Took a nap in the middle of the afternoon.  He flew in.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then Rick then slept in the bed.  Mm-hmm.  And got the guy's crabs that jumped off of him into the bed.  So I'm thinking either two things.  The guy's gay, so you get gay crabs.  Or the guy's not gay, but how else is your girlfriend going to explain that some guy was sleeping in her bed? 
[01:19:00]  You know what I mean?  It was like a Jack Tripper thing, you know?  Has to say he's gay.  This makes less sense than an Al Snow storyline.  That's exactly right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Anytime we can blast Al, it's a good thing.  We had Alan here recently.  Al's great.  We love Al.  Yeah.  He is a fun guy.  One more thing about Rick.  What?  We forgot about the chocolate.  Do they jump out when we say it?  You can't say that his daughter's sitting outside.  Noel, cover up your ears out there. 
[01:19:30]  This sounds like a good one.  Let's just say it was a chocolate palace.  It was part of the male anatomy molded in chocolate.  Look quite real.  It was big.  It was veiny.  It was chocolate.  Nice chocolate vein.  Right.  Big chocolate pumping vein.  Now, this fine company sent that over along with some...  Along with chocolate breasts.  Female stuff.  Female anatomy molded in chocolate that we were all snacking on here during the day.  Female ones.  He comes walking in with a...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, chomping away at a big chocolate member. 
[01:20:00]  Dude, it was like...  Veiny member.  It was like six inches long, but they had chopped it into a bunch of pieces, so I just grabbed  the piece and was eating it.  You know something?  First piece.  You rationalized it the way you want.  You walked in holding a big schlong of chocolate.  It was just a chunk.  It was like...  Yeah, whatever you want to call it, Rick.  You picked the wrong chunk, though, because it looked like a mushroom.  And it was veiny.  It had the veins in it.  And he said, I find the chocolate works better.  I just flicked my tongue at it. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  We were all fascinated watching his eating chocolate.  So, Rick, very secure with his sexuality.  I know Rick is so white if he's gay.  I don't care.  And I'll tell you...  Dude, I'm not gay!  Shut up!  Dude, I remember one time we were hanging out, and I said, hey, Rick, can I suck it?  And he said, yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Right, but the joke's on Norton, because I'm not gay.  Right.  Jesus, man.  Anyway, we have the great Macaulian.  Yes.  Who has a children's book out. 
[01:21:00]  That's right.  I was looking at this, and...  It's wafer thin.  Why the children's...  Hey, wait, wait.  Why the children's book?  Why?  You know, I like writing children's books.  I did a Christmas book last year.  A Christmas book, right?  Yeah.  Did very well.  Granted, banned in thousands of stores because of the Naked Elf.  And this time around, Judith Regan, the publisher of Regan Books...  Mm-hmm.  You really had a Naked Elf in there, and they banned the books?  Yeah.  You know, the deal was, Santa was downhearted because the elves don't want to make toys, 
[01:21:30]  and they just wanted to watch the WBF.  Being a father, I know that everyone goes through a time when their kids don't want to wear clothes.  You know, I remember saying to him, I said, God, do we just put...  You know, the grandma and grandpa are coming over.  He's like a year and a half old or two years old.  I said, just please put your clothes on.  He's like, I want to be nude guy.  You know?  So...  And it's kind of cute.  The Rugrats even did an episode where Tommy Pickles wasn't wearing clothes.  But apparently when Mick Foley does it, it's bad.  So this time around, I didn't want to offend anybody. 
[01:22:00]  So there's nothing even remotely offensive in there.  Or remotely entertaining, for that matter.  No, no.  Everyone really seems to like it.  As a matter of fact, Edge told me, he said, Edge, the wrestler, who's been on this show.  Of course.  Yeah, we did have the Edge on once.  And I think by radio, or by phone.  By phone, yeah.  Yeah.  I guess everyone's on by radio, but...  And he said, I just read my favorite Mick Foley book.  And I'm like, which one?  He said, you know, the Halloween book.  So I'm really happy with it. 
[01:22:30]  I've got a tremendous artist who does a nice job.  The illustrations are amazing.  Yeah, the illustrations are great.  And the nice thing, we did a bunch of book signings together.  And she told me that most authors and artists don't even know each other.  They just get picked and never meet.  And in our case, it's a nice working relationship.  Like, if you look here, while I'm talking, maybe you can scan to the page where you see  the WWF rack and all the clothes are gone.  And the line goes something like this.  It's the children headed to the store down the aisle, turn an aisle and headed left to 
[01:23:00]  the costumes of the superstars of the WWF.  Now, the next line reads, but their favorite costumes were all gone.  At least that is what they thought when behind a load of test costumes that not a single  child had bought.  And now, you know, you take someone who doesn't know wrestling or doesn't know me or doesn't  know Tess, and what are they going to do with that line?  But she was able to call me up and say, like, now, is Tess sensitive about his big horse  teeth?  And I was like, no, no.  Oh, my God.  Not at all. 
[01:23:30]  So that's why on the rack you've got the test wig, the test outfits, and the test teeth.  And Tess sees me and goes, really funny, man.  Yeah, that's all right.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  Any shots at Al Snow in this?  There's a couple shots in there.  Yeah?  Yeah, there's a couple shots.  There's something about the kid who didn't have a costume and Halloween seemed doomed  until he turned and said, let's go.  I'll try looking really dumb, so I'll look just like Al Snow. 
[01:24:00]  And that's the Al Snow joke.  But, you know, Al Snow jokes are on the way out because he's become too respectable after  Tough Enough.  Tough Enough.  Yeah, I could just point to his one loss record, you know.  He did a great job at that show.  He was tremendous with that.  I got hooked on that damn thing.  That was great.  Yeah, they should have you do it.  You know what?  I showed up on there, and I spent like two hours with the guys, you know, teaching them  stuff.  But I guess, you know, because I'm old and broken down, like, I couldn't do the cool stuff  like the Hardy Boys did.  I was like teaching them psychology and body language. 
[01:24:30]  And I guess things that were boring on a show like that, you know.  Yeah, great.  Great, man.  That's right.  When do we get to fly?  Yeah.  And so I stayed a couple hours, and I was basically on just for about a minute on their  show.  And whereas I was trying to be the guy, you know, Triple H literally scared one guy  who looked like a million bucks.  Remember that guy, the big jacked up guy?  Yeah.  Triple H came in and gave him a speech about how you'll never see your family and, you know,  you'll end up in divorce and just painted a horrible picture, which is partially true. 
[01:25:00]  And the guy quit, like, that night.  That was it.  So I was trying to tell them, hey, it's not that bad.  You know, I mean, I do a show like this, I bring my kids with me, you know.  You know, you just got to make time.  Wait till the naked girl show on there.  Ah, am I going to be out of there by then?  I hope so.  Actually, when we had Triple H in here, it was pretty fun.  What did he do?  He gave a girl a spanking.  A good one?  It was so good that there were broken blood vessels on her cheeks that she enjoyed a lot. 
[01:25:30]  We haven't heard from her since.  We did that at the Garden in Royal Rumble.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He still got the handprint on your ass.  You know, someone recently was in here.  Was it the Dudley Boys?  Mm-hmm.  Was it Bubba Ray who told us about Triple H's injury and how bad it was?  I didn't realize.  Where his thigh muscle rolled up.  Yeah, into a little ball.  Rolled up into a little ball and went up his leg.  You know what?  And they had to pull it back down and reattach the whole damn muscle. 
[01:26:00]  You know, it all comes down to common sense.  And this is why I lasted so long.  Listen to this.  No muscles equals no muscle tear.  All right?  You're going to walk around with those big muscles.  You're going to pay the price.  Everybody I know who's ever really looked great like that has injured their muscles at work.  You know, bicep tears out for six months.  A pec tear out for eight months.  And I just looked at that and I was like, you know what?  I see the psychology here.  You know?  You've got to pad and contain the muscles you do have with that layer of fat. 
[01:26:30]  A thick layer of walrus-like blubber.  Yeah.  It seems to work for you.  I didn't know you could tear a muscle that bad where it comes off the bone and rolls back up.  Oh, it just rolls up in a ball.  Yeah, it's horrible.  And then the guys who don't have them fixed.  Like, you see the guys who do their biceps.  Regal just tore a bicep and only tore it halfway.  And he's not going to have it fixed.  But it will just roll up in a little ball so you don't have a bicep.  I tore.  The most painful injury I've ever had in my life was a torn abdominal muscle.  I didn't even know I had it. 
[01:27:00]  And I showed up.  I mean, I was in so much pain that I saw this when I was in WCW that I thought I broke my pelvis.  And now I do not.  And this is the truth.  I don't know why a proctologist ended up examining my buttocks.  I was like, I don't.  Can you feel my pelvis that way?  You know?  And I mean.  To check for a broken pelvis?  Yeah.  What's wrong with an x-ray?  I don't know.  I don't know what he was trying to get there.  And I don't even think he was a doctor.  You know what it was?  And he was a radio show producer. 
[01:27:30]  He went to your house and he was yelling me out.  Yeah.  And you know, the sad part was, I woke up the next day.  Unfortunately, it remained.  Don't dump out of that.  Unfortunately, it remained the same size.  Oh!  Ow!  It was an abdominal muscle.  And it took me, you know, I was back in a few weeks.  But, you know, I wasn't the same for quite a while.  So you didn't, you know.  From the muscle of the exam. 
[01:28:00]  Both of them must shake you up a bit.  Why did the mule turn black, though?  What was that from?  The mule?  Yeah.  He calls it the mule.  Just so they don't dump out.  If they dump out, Napoleon's mule turned black.  Any trauma to that area turns that area black and blue.  It does.  It does.  It does.  It does, does it?  Yeah.  It does.  Wow.  It was pretty interesting.  Boy, I wouldn't wish that on anybody.  Oh, man.  All right.  We're just getting started with Mick Foley.  The book's called Halloween Hijinks. 
[01:28:30]  It's a children's book.  It's a children's book or a book.  That's all.  We have a ton of children listening to our show.  This is like the perfect mess.  Studies have shown that all the top children's authors are just dying and going away.  You know what?  I could picture Halloween this year.  A lot of people don't want to send their kids out.  They're a little scared.  You have your Halloween party.  All the kids come over.  And at some point, you could sit them down and read a mixed book.  That's right.  Wouldn't that be a fun little night out?  Just so you know, I will be reading that book on the Today Show on Halloween. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, really?  We're hanging out with a real star today.  On the Today Show.  Look at all.  Just found out.  I'm trying to say, can they guarantee that I'll be on with Katie?  And they're like, no, we can't guarantee you.  Oh, so who are you going to get?  I found out today that I get the extra segment where I get to read to a bunch of kids.  So it's going to be nice.  But she's not going to be there?  No, no.  She'll be there.  Matt Lauer is going to be there.  You know, they're going to stick me with Roker probably.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I could see that.  The fun-loving Al Roker.  Yeah.  I don't know who I'm going to get, but it should be my experience. 
[01:29:30]  That's exciting.  Yeah.  Are you doing any books in the near future?  You know what?  I'm doing one at WWF New York on the 29th, right before Smackdown, at 6 o'clock until whenever.  So if anyone wants to go by there.  You know, last time, I think I was here and I was telling you guys, now look, anyone listening,  don't worry about the lines.  Yeah.  I stayed on every book is finished.  How late were you there, man?  Well, I didn't have to see.  You know, it wasn't like there were so many people, whereas the first book, you know,  there was lines that long.  But I'm like, yeah, I guess, you know, I'm like that last half an hour. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, was it?  It worked out good.  I've learned out of pace, you know, I get a feeling for the line and then I go a little  longer.  You can slow down if you don't want to.  Usually the only time I slow down, you know, in a big line is if it's a really good looking  woman, you know.  Sure.  What's your name?  About what you're saying?  Hi, how are you doing?  How are you doing?  Good.  Did you enjoy the book?  It reminds us of when we were signing our CD at Tower Records in Boston.  Oh, my God.  We put out a CD a few years back and some of the signings were unbelievable. 
[01:30:30]  We went out to Springfield and we were there for eight hours.  I mean, the line went out of the mall.  It was ridiculous.  We pulled up to the mall in Springfield and we were like, Jesus, what's going on here today?  Yeah.  You know, we really did.  We walked in and went, there's barricades set up and a line going around the whole mall  area.  And we're like, well, this is going to screw up our signing.  I swear to God, we have no clue.  It was for us.  And then it was for us.  But then the Tower Records.  Yeah, then we were humbled because now we're thinking, wow, we're movie stars. 
[01:31:00]  We're rock stars now, man.  We go to Tower Records in Boston.  There had to be 12 people online.  Yeah.  And the people were like, can you just slow down your signing so it looks like we have  people online?  Well, it was great because the station we were on.  So every signing took like five minutes, just like you said.  The station we were on, you couldn't hear it in Boston.  Right.  So we were on Springfield where you'd heard the station.  It was great.  Great signing.  Boston, nothing.  You know what?  There was a signing here.  I wrote about this in my first book. 
[01:31:30]  Me and Owen Hart, after the, I think it was Sacramento, it was a pay-per-view.  And I'd been in the main event, but I was a bad guy.  We're doing a signing right after the show.  And there had to be a thousand people in that line, you know?  So I looked at Owen.  I'm like, geez, we're not going to have much time to do any kind of, you know, personalization,  any kind of talking or anything.  And I'm going through it like, God, Foley, you know, our mankind, whatever.  I'm writing, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ten minutes later, our line is done.  I look over there.  There's still 963 people in line.  And I was like, what the hell is going on here?  And they're like, well, Austin's doing a signing. 
[01:32:00]  When you guys are done, they're here for Austin.  I was like, oh, damn.  So everyone else who wanted to get online got the Mick Foley poem.  It was like, dear Joe, it matters not how narrow the gate.  You know, and that was the truth.  I was like, oh, this is the humbling most.  And Owen's laughing at me, you know, like, oh, we've only got an hour and 35 minutes left.  It was just horrible.  Everyone's there watching you die.  And it's still, it's still to this, to this day, you know, I've had a lot of good book signings. 
[01:32:30]  But still, when I show up, I'm like, you know, I get that feeling like, oh, God, please let there be people.  God, if there's no people.  And one of my greatest moments was when I'm signing at the Mall of America a few months ago.  And I see that their little flyer on the cover of the flyer.  It's got a picture of me right next to a picture of Kathy Lee Giffords.  And she was there the day before.  And then I said, geez, how did Kathy do?  And they said, well, you've got three times more people than Kathy.  And I was like, yeah, yeah, baby.  So how come my house is three times smaller than hers? 
[01:33:00]  All right, we've got to take a break.  Yeah.  A lot of people want to talk to Mick Foley.  Oh, hell yeah.  If you're on hold, stay there.  We'll get to your phone calls next.  1027 WNEW.  Oh.  Check it out.  The Opinion Joe in studio.  Mick Foley from the WNEW.  Yes.  He's got another children's happening.  Halloween high.  There you go.  Very good reviews.  He's going to be reading a little bit of it on the Today Show in the near future.  Yes.  For Halloween.  Now I feel bad that I shook your hand, Mick. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, see?  I shook your hand because we talked in during our show, whatever.  And I just want to, you know, formally say, hey, Mick's been a while.  Hi.  And I shake your hand.  And then you tell me you don't like shaking hands anymore.  I'm walking around.  Whenever I see someone, I just got the arms open for a hug now because it's safe.  You want to shake the handshake?  Well, I think so.  You know, here's the roots of the problem.  I was always, you know, I was always a pretty big shaker.  And then I went to Malaysia.  And one of the things that's flipped me out about, you know, the whole Muslim, not Muslim 
[01:34:00]  problem, but the problem stemming from September 11th is that I've been to a lot of these countries  that are, you know, 90% Muslims, some of them 99.  And, like, these people are huge wrestling fans.  And you know how you were talking about Springfield and how the mob scene was there to see you  guys?  Yeah.  Well, I went in.  The biggest reception I've ever gotten in my life by far is Malaysia.  Malaysia.  Malaysia, which is, I think, 75%.  Sounds like a disease.  Malaysia.  Kuala Lumpur.  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
[01:34:30]  And what the hell were you doing in Malaysia?  Wrestling, by the way.  I was not wrestling.  I was there like a goodwill ambassador for the WWF.  Oh.  The show is hugely popular.  As a matter of fact, when I was next door in Indonesia, they actually had more people  watching the WWF in Indonesia than they do in the USA, which is a little bit strange.  I mean, you know, all the people over there, I don't think they've got the 100 channels  like we do.  Right, right.  If WWF is on, chances are they're watching it.  It's you and Gilligan's Island that they got the choice from, so slow down. 
[01:35:00]  And I remember them asking me if I would speak to Muslim leaders who thought our show  was too violent.  And I remember talking to these guys, and it was all fine.  When I left this one appearance, I remember them saying, you know, how did you like it?  Did you like it?  And I said, look, everybody wants to be loved.  I don't want to be loved quite that much.  You know, it was the type of thing.  It was like a five-story mall.  And everywhere I looked up, it was a big circle.  And it was like cool.  There were people like just ascending up, up into the atmosphere.  And there were so many people that I was given the right hand shake most of the time. 
[01:35:30]  The right hand, here comes the left hand.  And the right, like three times, I heard someone say, no left, like to the children, you know.  Oh, really?  So the guys who were on the tour, whatever they call them, that help you out there from  Malaysia, they took the last day, took that opportunity on the last day of the tour to  say, do you know why they don't shake with the left?  Uh-uh.  And I said, no.  And they said, because that's the hand they wipe with.  And I said, well, you know, what do you mean they wipe with it? 
[01:36:00]  And they were like, without the benefit of toilet paper.  Because it's my life.  And that's why they hold the hand behind their back when they meet you and they shake with  the right hand.  And apparently, you know, I'm not a, you know, I'm not a real student of Islam, but apparently  when somebody is caught robbing, you know how they always talk about they chop off the  hand.  They chop off the right hand because that's like double the penalty because now they have  to eat and do everything.  With that crappy hand.  Yeah.  So that's when I came back and I'm like, now I've got the eebie-jeebies. 
[01:36:30]  Everyone, it seems like any time I come out of a bathroom, I see some guy with his hands,  you know, his eyes wide open and a hand like way up in the air, like the cross, you know,  the cross the hallway.  And they go, I've got to shake your hand.  So for those of you who've been wondering why Mick Foley's been faking a hand injury for  the last two years, you know, it's essentially, it's just a little bit scary, you know.  And I asked, I remember, sometimes, believe it or not, for people who watch our show, this  might seem a little weird, but I'll ask my mother, like, if material I want to talk about 
[01:37:00]  is appropriate.  And I said, Mom, do you think I can, like, discuss the, you know, the whole idea that,  you know, about 70% of people don't even wash their hands after he's in the bathroom?  And she's like, no, you can't do that on this show.  It's your duty as a celebrity to shake as many hands as possible.  And so what I've done now, you can't do it in real life, so what you do is you take,  I'm writing a novel, believe it or not, you know, on the heels of this.  And so I have one of my characters who hates to shake hands.  Oh, brilliant.  Yeah, I get all that. 
[01:37:30]  You use cactus.  I misuse his character.  That's great.  You know something?  I shook your hand as well.  That has happened, though, at, uh...  I had just come out of the bathroom on that occasion.  Madison Square Garden or the Yankee game, I'm at the stadium or something.  I will walk into the bathroom, well, we have a lot of fans that go to Yankee games and whatnot,  and I'll hear, hey, Anthony, and the first thing I say, I walk in and go,  well, I am shaking no one's hand in the bathroom.  And most people start laughing, you know?  Because the bathroom's the worst. 
[01:38:00]  I've been right next to people at the urinal going to the bathroom.  They zip up and go, dude, what's up?  And put their hand in.  I was like, man, you know, maybe if I was Rick, but now you just had your hand wrapped around that.  So I feel the same way about that whole thing.  I kind of like the wash and the hand.  So if you guys had how many people in that line in Springfield?  Over, I don't know.  It was eight hours.  Yeah, thousands.  At least as fast as it was 2,000.  So chances are that by the time those eight hours were off, you had picked about 100 people's noses. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Scratched about 100 people's butts and maybe done a little something else.  A little Yankee cranky.  All by proxy.  Some of our listeners think it's fun to give us the stink bomb.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They think it's a hoot.  Yeah.  You reach back.  You reach back.  You reach back on your own thing.  You get it stinky.  And then you shake it with someone.  Someone has definitely done that to you.  I'm sure somebody has.  Let's go to the phones there.  They're lit.  Doug from Springfield.  You're first with Mick Foley, man. 
[01:39:00]  Mick, how long were you sitting in that gravel driveway?  Which gravel driveway?  The gravel driveway.  What do you mean?  The gravel driveway.  I don't understand you.  I don't really know what you mean.  You saw Mick in tight, I guess, right?  Was there a night out on a dog like this, Alice?  I don't know what you mean.  I don't know what you mean.  I don't know what you mean.  Well, I think the guy was suggesting that when you wore the tight pants, it looks like you  spent so much time sitting in a gravel driveway.  Because of the indications in my buttocks.  Yeah.  The guy enjoys your butt.  And, you know, there was this one time, and this is very shortly after, I think the next 
[01:39:30]  day, I went to sweatpants look.  Yeah.  Do you guys remember the triple threat match?  It was me, The Rock, and Ken Shamrock in a cage.  We missed Ken Shamrock.  Ken Shamrock was cool, right?  We were all good guys.  We were all vying for a special shot of the champion or something.  And The Rock, we're up on top of the cage, swinging it out, throwing punches.  It was like this great, dramatic moment.  The crowd was really into it, and the camera gets that upshot of my butt.  And it did look like a piece of Swiss cheese that backed into a belt sander.  It looked horrible. 
[01:40:00]  And I think it was that next day, I'm like, I am not getting out of this.  Hey, Steve, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Foley.  Yes.  I love you.  Thank you.  I have all the books.  I have figures.  I have tapes.  Yeah, but Opie's got his own stalker.  Yeah.  She's just showing my daughter her haircut.  She's wearing a wig because she's got no hair.  Yeah.  It's plastic hair.  Yeah.  I have one question.  Yes.  I read, I don't know how true it is, but I read on the computer that Vince offered you  a chance to get back in the ring with Regal, and you turned it down. 
[01:40:30]  How come?  Oh, you know what?  That was a chance.  This is where Mick gets in trouble with the WWF office.  When my book came out, there was some things in there that were true, first and foremost.  But the only reason I decided to include them is because they would have made such easy angles  on television, like where I said that Vince was the, you know, it was ironic that the  guy who made sports entertainment so acceptable for the masses was the only guy in the WWF  who felt compelled to become a wrestling character any time a mainstream camera light was on. 
[01:41:00]  And this is even before he was on Custis.  And I think I said, what is it?  Does Vince have something in his brain that says, okay, red light's on, time to act like  an idiot.  And I said, you know, that the reason, you know, now business is sliding a little bit,  but at the time, you know, with a company, a hundred million dollars in stock was doing  nothing.  Yeah.  And I thought it was because to the general public, Vince McMahon looks like a lunatic  and people don't trust him with a billion dollars.  You know, there was that guy in that he could have very easily turned into something, you 
[01:41:30]  know, in the ring with me and him.  And then they asked, and I said, will the emphasis still be on the book?  And they said, yeah.  And, you know, in my opinion, the WWF wasn't doing a very good job of promoting the book.  I mean, they never even, I had a bitch with them because they never once told the public  that I wrote it myself.  You know, I think because it makes the other guys look bad by comparison.  And my feeling on that is, well, if that's the truth, then don't tell anybody that Kurt  Angle won an Olympic gold because none of us have. 
[01:42:00]  You know what I mean?  Right.  It makes you guys look bad.  You know, that's my, you know, my pride.  I take a lot of pride in doing my own writing.  So my feeling was if they weren't holding up their end of the bargain, then I wasn't  going to hold up mine.  And I talked to William Regal about it just a couple of days ago.  I didn't want him to think it was anything personal with him.  But I look at it like I've got one good match left in me, you know, maybe.  And it can only be done if all the channels are working properly.  And in that case, it was just going to be another match.  So I decided to ease out of it. 
[01:42:30]  Waiting for the big one.  Ant, we have McMahon on the phone.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Has something to say to Mick.  You are fired!  You know what you want?  I may have already said this.  I love that.  I may have already said this to you guys.  When I called in on the phone, the one time Vince was telling me, he goes, well, as a  person, Mick, you're not bad.  But as a commissioner, you suck.  And he choked on that.  He's like, Vince turned Yiddish all of a sudden.  He's like, suck.  Oh, you're in your veins and knees like a dog. 
[01:43:00]  That's it.  You're round like a dog.  And there's Wall Street looking down.  And the guy is legitimately...  Of course.  He's a genius.  And backstage, you know, I've dug him where I said, I've never even seen him yell at anyone  in the WWF.  I've seen him get mad, but I've never seen...  I would say if you lined up all the billionaires in the world, that Vince is probably at the  front of the line of the coolest.  But he looks like a maniac.  He does.  As soon as he gets on the show.  After watching Costas, would you be like, no? 
[01:43:30]  Oh, we'd love the Costas.  I've got 10 grand.  I think I'll invest it in that company.  When he leans over and Costas just loses his tactics and everything just...  He looks so scared.  He called him pal.  A pal.  Okay, pal.  Anytime you call someone a pal.  Ah.  And then he's playing those clips.  Take your bra off and take it off now.  Take your bra off and take it off now.  Well, these are characters that...  Do you think it's good for children?  Shut up. 
[01:44:00]  Chris, you got it?  Have a nice job.  Chris, you got a question for Mick Foley?  Actually, I got two for Mr. Foley.  Okay.  All right.  It might have been partly answered.  I've got three boys who love you, Mick.  Thank you.  From ages 12 down to 5.  And we watch the WWF.  They want to know if you're going to get back in the ring.  Yeah, I don't think...  I don't think...  Okay.  They're mad about you.  Let me see you.  Even if they're in bed.  They get up, they start yelling, hey, Mick, something to me.  Well, you know that story I was talking about on top of the cage? 
[01:44:30]  Yep.  That was about 30 pounds ago.  So...  Yes.  30 pounds.  30 pounds lighter at the time.  So things looked that bad then.  I don't really need to get out there.  You know, I don't want to be like one of these people who's going over the lighting with  the WWF guys.  Okay, don't shoot my head.  Oh, no.  Have there been?  I've got another question.  Have there been guys that have done that?  No, no, no.  Girls, right?  There have been a couple of girls, right?  Go ahead, Chris.  One more question.  I was wondering, are you guys got, like, any tickets to the WWF for a working father with 
[01:45:00]  four kids?  I don't know what we got.  We usually have them.  What?  Yeah, you know what?  Hold on.  That's your lucky day.  We'll take care of you.  Hold on.  Thanks.  All right.  We'll send you some in the mail, okay?  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Dan.  Hey, Dan, what's up?  Yo, Foley.  Yes.  What's going on, man?  How are you doing?  Yo, big fan.  I got a question, dude.  Hey, can I ask you guys something?  Don't you think Stone Cold is the worst friggin' bad guy you've ever seen in your life on the  WWF?  Yeah, Stone Cold needs to be a good guy. 
[01:45:30]  And Vince McMahon needs to be a bad guy.  You know, here's my take on it.  The Stone Cold who's been Kumbaya.  He's funny, but that's really what you want your top bad guy doing.  Tell me you didn't laugh really hard with Kurt Angle with the tiny little cowboy hat.  Oh, that stuff was great.  That stuff was great.  Dude, what's that thing with the what?  When he says what act, everything comes out of his mouth.  I don't get it.  Someone needs to say it.  I think Debra's messing up his whole character, man.  I don't get it with Debra.  You know what?  But my point is, when he turned, remember he became the Stone Cold of Old at the invasion, 
[01:46:00]  and then he turned on WWF and became WCW.  I think at that point he really should have been the Stone Cold of Old.  And who cares if they cheer him?  He should have been kicking butt, which he does some of the time, and he still does the  comp.  And I take that as a compliment, because there's little shades of the old Mankind checker.  I don't know.  I just should have played it serious.  He's great.  You know, he's one of the most resilient bad guys out there.  But the thing with the cookies, probably not the best idea.  No, no.  The cookies. 
[01:46:30]  Your top bad guy probably shouldn't be eating cookies.  It is funny.  All right, Dan.  Yo, I got a jet.  Yo, Foley, you rule, man.  Stay out of the range.  Do what you paid to do, dog.  Oh, thank you.  And all in there, you guys kick ass.  What I want to ask is, you know how I used to walk around, and I used, how are you doing?  Do you think, with all the tensions, you know, the Mugman West, that Budweiser pulled  that commercial, because it appeared to be a Middle Eastern guy with the big white teeth  going, how are you doing?  How are you doing? 
[01:47:00]  That was my guess.  Like, maybe they thought that we were dissing them.  You could be right on that one.  Could be.  I like that guy, though.  If he's out there, we miss you, man.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  You were in Kansas City for SmackDown last week or so.  How does that feel with the whole Owen Hart thing, going back there?  Oh, it's kind of weird.  You know, I was calling my wife from the exact same place where I called her to tell her  that Owen had died.  You know, I mean, you try to block that out of your mind, but literally, you're walking  everywhere you're walking, you're saying, oh, this is where I was, you know, when that  happened, and it was kind of depressing. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, nothing against people in Kansas City, but, you know, it's not my favorite place  to revisit, definitely.  Yeah, I guess not.  It's a constant reminder, looking at every little thing.  Yeah, right.  No, very good.  Norman, you're really good.  I have to pause there in my, you know.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing, guys?  Mick, I'm going to ask you about my pro you did with Willie Reed.  That's great because just as the cameras cut off right after you're playing with yourself,  he started cracking up as the cameras faded.  That was hysterical, man.  No, that's something we came up with.  You know what?  There was actually something. 
[01:48:00]  It's not going to sound that funny, but we kept on laughing because Regal is, you know,  he's kind of like the guy in The Patriot, that colonel or whatever.  He's just this, you know, cold-blooded guy.  And then when he said, because after Survivor Series, there won't be a WWF.  And I went, will too.  And he went, oh!  And every time we tried to take him, I started thinking of him, I was looking at him, thinking  of him going, duh!  So, I mean, it's good.  I was laughing so hard that my back hurt. 
[01:48:30]  And, yeah, but that was kind of funny when we did the, you know, the playing with yourself  line and you could see him laugh off camera.  You know, I think, personally, I think the fans like to see that type of thing.  Oh, hell yeah.  They like the guys who are enjoying themselves.  So, you know, in between, in one of the breaks, Opie was talking to me about the show,  and I think, you know, that at this point, people need a lighter, friendlier WWF.  That's just my opinion.  And maybe that's why I'm back there, to write children's books.  Hey, Peter, you're next with Mick Foley. 
[01:49:00]  Great.  How are you guys doing?  I'm pretty good.  You're on the air.  All right.  I want to know you guys rule.  I'm Mick.  I actually just got done reading.  Have a nice day.  I wanted to mention it was one of the best pieces of writing that I've read in a while.  The writing is really good.  The writing in the story is emotional and it's true.  And that's what's awesome about you.  Yeah, I really appreciate that.  Thank you.  And I wanted to thank you as a sports entertainment performer, just for everything you've given a sport.  Wow.  That's really nice of you.  Thank you.  Right on, bro.  All right.  Thanks.  Thanks, guys.  Okay. 
[01:49:30]  We have to take another break.  We have boob-a-lantern chicks here.  Hot chicks for boob-a-lantern chicks.  You know what?  Unfortunately, I mean, we're for the big hunger across town.  Yeah.  No, I'm judging.  Now, I asked the WWF.  I was like, how does me eating lots of ice cream help the homeless?  And they're like, well, you'll find out when you get there.  Oh, really?  I'm taking place in an ice cream contest to, you know, to lick hunger.  So I've got to go.  What time is that at?  That's at 6.  6?  Okay.  So I've got to bail out of here.  But, guys, I really appreciate being on the show. 
[01:50:00]  Watch out for the brain freeze.  Yeah.  All right.  Watch out for the brain freeze.  What's the brain freeze?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  And don't freeze up like Bobby Brady did in that episode of the ice cream eating contest.  No, that was Cindy who froze up on the quiz show.  Baton Rouge.  Oh, right, right.  Bobby just lost.  Bobby went to her afterwards because Cindy was embarrassed.  And he said, look, at least you got on the show.  I didn't even bother to study.  Right.  And then they throw him a little party at the house anyway.  I was just on Millionaire.  And the same thing happened to me, except I was busy staring at Martina McBride, the country singer. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah?  I couldn't take my eyes off.  How'd you do?  I did pretty good, actually.  And, you know, raised a lot of money.  And Martina and I have the same charity, the police, fire, New York Police and Fire Widows and Children's Fund.  Nice.  And after I was done, I got to hang out in the audience with Kevin Bacon.  And how many people can say that?  Yeah.  We said hi to Kevin that couple of times.  A little award show.  That's right.  Did Regis even know who you are?  Regis likes me. 
[01:51:00]  Man Hall.  We're here with Man Hall.  Like he gets everything wrong a little bit.  He's from the Planetary Wrestling Foundation.  Like, why?  Read it?  Well, and no one corrects it.  They just know he's reading it.  You know what I got off?  That's great.  When I got home, I'm telling my wife about the millionaire and, you know, how cool it was up to be up there, you know, and Martina McBride.  And I was like, yeah, then I got to sit with Kevin Bacon.  And she's like, didn't you say you had the biggest penis in Hollywood?  I was like, I just forgot all about that. 
[01:51:30]  Like, oh, damn, I'd have asked him.  That's great.  He's reading him and James Woods of the current guys.  Respecting Uncle Miltie or Forrest Tucker in the league.  Forrest Tucker, yeah, from F-True.  The biggest mule.  The biggest mule.  I didn't say the B word.  That's all right.  I don't know.  They're weird about that.  Mule.  They're strange.  All right, so Mick Foley's latest book, Halloween Hijinks.  It's a children's book this time around.  It's getting really good reviews, so pick that up for your kids.  And there's a picture of Kevin Bacon in there also.  And his mule.  And his mule.  Hey, thanks, guys. 
[01:52:00]  Have a great day.  Mick Foley.  One of our faves.  All right, as we go to break here, we've got to play the Cipro song again.  All right.  From Manic Larry.  He sent this little ditty in today.  And we'll be back.  We have a rendition of I Had the Time of My Life on the way.  Yeah, this.  We heard it.  I was laughing my ass off in the office listening to this.  No offense to Mick Foley, but this could be the funniest thing today.  Yeah.  So you shouldn't turn that dial.  No.  And we also have the boob-a-lantern chicks that have arrived.  Really hot chicks that will get their boobs lit up for the contest.  Okay?  The Cipro song. 
[01:52:30]  Check it out.  Open up your mail and we're all going to die.  Open up your mail and we're all going to die.  Cipro may not be holistic.  Taking extra doses.  But it's the only drug that kills the anthrax in your nose.  It's Bin Laden and his kooky gang.  Our towel had crazy psychotics.  For breakfast, lunch, and dinner, we all eat antibiotics.  Open up your mail and we're all going to die.  Open up your mail and we're all going to die.  The junk mail you've been getting could be from the Taliban. 
[01:53:00]  I'll never enter sweeps, they said, I get from Ed McMahon.  This anthrax scare has made us all a bunch of nervous wrecks.  Just wear your gloves and masks when you get letters from FedEx.  Hey!  Sending anthrax in our mail will never be forgotten.  Now tell Blue Cross you need this drug and bill it to Bin Laden.  And Cipro may not be holistic, but we must be cautious.  It kills those nasty spores so that you won't feel so damn nauseous.  Cipro kills those spores so that you won't feel so damn nauseous. 
[01:53:30]  You guys have, you guys have, you guys have redefined debauchery.  What a voice billful on acid.  Opie Anthony.  And welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show.  In the New York area, if you want to give us a call, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Boston.  Boston, we're coming, baby. 
[01:54:00]  Boston.  Boston, celebrating my third wife's demise.  The old Chinaman.  Bull, Bill!  Give us a call, 866-277-4WOW.  We will be broadcasting from Boston Monday and Tuesday.  Hosting the Grave Rave, Anthony.  Nice.  Judging the Halloween costumes.  Oh!  That's always fun.  Suzanne, what's up?  What's up, guys? 
[01:54:30]  How you doing?  Pretty good.  How you?  I'm going to be at the Grave Rave on Monday, and I just wanted to know if you guys are  going to be accessible.  I want to make sure I meet you.  Accessible?  Yes.  We're always accessible.  Oh, yeah.  Just show up at the WBCN studios.  We encourage that on Monday and Tuesday.  Yeah.  We'll poke our head out and say hi and hang out like we did when we went to Philly.  All right, sounds good.  And we're going to continue the Booba Lantern contest up there Monday and Tuesday.  Okay.  Well, mine are real, so that won't work.  You got tickets for the Grave Rave? 
[01:55:00]  Yes.  Oh, you do?  I was going to give you some.  I have them already, actually.  I like the honesty.  All right, we'll see you up in Boston.  Thanks for the offer.  All right, Suzanne.  All right, see you guys.  There she goes.  Bye.  The Booba Lantern contest is on.  There's at least seven girls outside the studio.  That many?  Well, we have a bunch from Privileged Gentleman's Club.  Yeah.  And we also have a few just regular listeners.  And is Rick taking pictures and whatnot?  Rick is busy in the closet as we speak. 
[01:55:30]  Ah, he's in the prize closet?  Yes.  Nice.  With the guy that brought them.  Now, Ken Stevens didn't understand the Booba Lantern contest.  He thought it was a really stupid idea.  Are you kidding?  He thought, like, hot girls would come down with big boobs.  Yeah.  And we would somehow take the flashlights and lift their shirt a little bit and then just  flash the lights inside their shirt.  Ugh.  You know, has he been tested for retardation or something?  What?  What?  Like, it was...  You pull the shirt away. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  You just shine the flag for a little bit of a distance under the shirt onto the boobs  and you see the boobs through the shirt?  Yeah, maybe it made a shadow or something.  I don't know.  Are we that inept in our description of this contest?  So I go, Ken, Ken, Ken.  And we go to opieandanthony.com.  Ken, Ken, Ken, come here, come here.  Bam!  And we popped up the pictures that are now up on opieandanthony.com.  Yeah.  And now he fully understands.  And he thinks it's a great, great contest.  Of course. 
[01:56:30]  Why would you show her through this shirt?  This is not a CCD contest.  No.  No, the girls get topless.  In the closet.  We do a little before pictures so you get to see what they look like and what she looks  like.  And then we turn off all the lights.  And you get the high-power flashlights.  You put them directly on the boobs.  Yeah.  And they glow.  They glow in the dark.  They glow like a little goldfish fish tank.  If you had light behind it.  They really do light up nicely.  You can check it out on the website.  We have one picture up on opieandanthony.com. 
[01:57:00]  It is just bright red, both the boobs in perfect circles.  That's all you see because the lights are out.  The red planet.  It looks like Mars.  So here's the deal.  A lot of ladies showed up today.  Ladies, you can show up tomorrow between 3 and 7.  And then Monday and Tuesday in Boston for all the Boston listeners.  Ladies, if you had the breast implants.  It only works with breast implants.  Come on by and you can be part of this contest.  Third place prize.  Tickets to see Aerosmith in either New York, Boston, or Philly.  Second place DVD player from Samsung and a Boogeyman DVD. 
[01:57:30]  And first place, $1,000 cash.  $1,000.  First place, a Cadillac.  Second place, a set of steak knives.  Third place, you're effing fired.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Just a quick question.  Yeah.  We just said that Rick was busy in the closet.  I was just curious.  Will he be coming out of that closet anytime soon?  Will Rick be coming out of the closet?  I would think yes.  I believe Rick will be coming out of the closet by 6 o'clock.  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Okay, thanks, guys. 
[01:58:00]  Rick, let's say, is in a closet at some point.  At a point, he has to come out of the closet.  I enjoy the Uncle John call every day.  Yeah.  He's very witty.  Rick has been fighting for months to make this a Mulo lantern.  No, you put the light under the helmet.  Do it closed.  Let's light up yam bags.  All right.  So, you know, I think we've got the funniest thing of the day coming up right here.  Yeah.  If you're just tuning in, though, you missed a visit from the Pigeria kid.  Pigeria, Pilgeria. 
[01:58:30]  Pigeria?  Pigeria.  That disease where, you know, little kids age really, really fast.  It's Pigeria.  Pigeria?  Yeah, I think that's what it's called.  But I don't use it to get anywhere in life.  I'm a normal kid, just a normal 90-year-old kid with the body of a 96-year-old man.  Yeah.  Because of the grace of God, he decided to plague me with this.  But that's fine.  I have no problem with that.  I'm still a normal kid.  I want to thank Mick Foley.  He gave me one of his books, the children's books, because I am a child at heart. 
[01:59:00]  And it's wonderful.  I shook his hand, and his big, meaty, wrestling hand crushed my little, brittle, saltine cracker mitt.  So I'm going to have to have that checked out.  And speaking of Halloween, for Halloween, I'm going to go as an alien with a mustache.  All I have to get is a mustache.  So he stopped by earlier.  Yeah.  My question is, can you get arrested for banging one of them?  Oh, my God.  I mean, if you say, look, I didn't know, I thought he was 50. 
[01:59:30]  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  Bing, bing.  Bing, bing.  And Don West stopped by to sell his Cipro.  Yeah, his Cipro.  So he missed that fine stuff.  But I think this little song that we're about to play beats both those little bits.  Oh, my God.  We got, I don't know where this came from.  It's, I think we got Steve to thank from foundrymusic.com.  He trolls the websites, and I guess he dug this up.  It is actually, I guess there was a function of a ritual. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, you want a warm-up to the song?  A warm-up.  Yeah, because there's something else we've got to play that we've been sitting on.  Kid Chris from KXOA in Sacramento.  Uh-huh.  He's been helping out the show.  He's on After Us in Sacramento.  Yeah.  And he's been sending us a lot of his stuff.  Yeah.  He pranked Ted Turner.  He got Ted Turner?  Ted Turner on the line.  All right.  How did he get that?  Uh, he made believe he was John Rocker.  Oh, no.  New York will especially love us.  Remember all the crap John Rocker said about New York, and it caused that mess? 
[02:00:30]  Of course.  John Rocker, Kid Chris, called up Ted Turner to apologize.  Oh, he really got Ted Turner.  All right, let's hear it.  And Kid Chris was playing this on the show like crazy, and he sent it our way.  Kid Chris, got to love him.  Check this out.  And then we'll get to the song, but this is like the little warm-up.  Hello?  Ted?  Yeah?  It's John Rocker.  John!  How are you, Ted? 
[02:01:00]  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?  I'm okay.  How about you?  I'm surprised I got you at this house.  Well, I'm glad you got me.  I was thinking about calling you.  Okay.  How are you doing?  Well, I'm doing okay.  I really think I goof, though.  Well, I know.  I mean, hell, you know, I've opened my big, fat mouth many, many times in similar circumstances.  I've apologized to everybody in the goddamn world.  I just was lucky.  I didn't say quite so much at one time and get in quite as much trouble as you did, but 
[02:01:30]  on a smaller degree, I have, and I, you know, hell.  I think it just got blown out of proportion.  Yeah, well, I agree.  I mean, it's just too bad.  You know, you've learned now, you know, it's always best to, you know, if you can't say  something nice, like in Bambi, what Thumper's mother told him, don't say anything at all.  At least that gets you out of trouble.  And the New York fans poured beer and spit on me up there.  I know, you know, anyway, did they? 
[02:02:00]  No, I just, you know, I'm just a dumb redneck.  You know, I got suspended.  You know, I just didn't know.  No, I know that.  All right.  I know.  Now, who had me suspended?  Did the Jews make me get suspended?  You're not John Rocker.  Oh.  It's the same guy that called me.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, that, the little delay there is brutal. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, you can hear that.  You're not John Rocker.  That's the same guy that's been calling me.  He's quoting Bambi.  Oh, I quoted the Bambi of the guy and it was a gag.  Damn it.  I did the Bambi quote.  Like when you marry a woman who sits on an enemy tank.  Yeah.  Oh.  There you have it.  Kid Chris from Sacramento helping out the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you, Kid Chris.  That is brutal.  He must have been sweating when he actually picked up and it was Ted Turner.  Yeah.  You know how it is when you make those prank calls.  Yeah, we've done a few ourselves. 
[02:03:00]  You get all nervous and stuff.  Done a few ourselves.  So, we got a song.  Yeah.  Thanks to us, Steve C.  It seems that there was some kind of event that a bunch of retarded people were at.  What's up?  What are you looking at?  I want to get Steve into explaining it because I can continue.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, and a bunch of retarded people were at.  Maybe a camp or something.  I don't know.  But it was a gathering of retarded people.  And one of the little activities that they had was karaoke.  They had karaoke.  You haven't heard this yet?  No.  Oh, I can't wait to get your reaction. 
[02:03:30]  And we're going to play the karaoke song.  Now, Steve, do you have any background on this?  You know, someone, I think his name's Pete, sent me this MP3 last night.  These headphones suck.  And it sounds legit to me.  I mean, this really sounds legit because there's all of that background noise beforehand.  It sounds like it might have been a karaoke booth.  Yeah, I'm thinking like it was some event where you take retarded people and they had karaoke. 
[02:04:00]  And a couple of these retarded people decided to do a duet.  They did the song from Dirty Dancing, I Had the Time of My Life, in an inimitable retarded fashion, which, it's killer.  If this is fake, it is the best fake retarded.  You know something?  I tend to think it's real.  It's too good.  Yeah, if someone was trying to fake it, it would sound like a fake retard thing.  This is so retarded. 
[02:04:30]  Don't wreck my buzz, Steve.  I think it's real.  Yeah, absolutely.  I think so, too.  This is hysterical.  Here it is.  Two retards singing karaoke from Dirty Dancing.  You may want to slow down because I don't want you driving off the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had the time of my life.  Now, I never felt this way before.  Yes, I swear it's the truth. 
[02:05:00]  And I know it all to you.  Because I've had the time of my life.  Now, I've always felt the view.  That's a newer go.  This is great.  Patrick crazy.  I've been waiting for so long.  Now, I finally found this one to stay by me.  What? 
[02:05:30]  That big snack tongs got in the way.  Yeah, we're riding on the wall.  And you felt the magic called fantasy.  Don't wreck my buzz.  Now, we're watching it in our eyes.  It's a way because it's like it's easy to dream.  What?  Now, we take each other's hands.  Cause we make each other's stand.  Just our tea.  Just remember.  Just remember. 
[02:06:00]  Just remember.  Oh, it's cute, right?  It's cute, naughty, stinky. 
[02:06:30]  Oh.  Please, don't call it.  It's a solo.  And my body and soul comes.  You know that you never know.  Thanks.  So tight, just let it go.  Be afraid to lose control.  Of your balance.  Your noise or your mind.  You say, stay with me tonight. 
[02:07:00]  Me?  Say the more.  Say the more.  One more, one more thing.  I can't get in the box.  Don't tell yourself, baby.  Don't tell yourself, baby.  This time is long.  Because I'm a man.  Go, baby, go.  I never know, baby, go. 
[02:07:30]  I can't make it true.  Turn it off.  It's a retard and dancing.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  that is 
[02:08:00]  now remember baby  run to me  I lift you up  and dump you  on your head  it certainly  makes you  understand  the thinking  of certain  women in  Houston  it's a  carry out  oh here's  the big ending  yeah  it's a  oh  at the time 
[02:08:30]  of my life  and I never  felt this way  before  without this  way  it's not the  truth  and I owe  it all to you  at the time  of my life  at the time  of my life  and I never  felt this way  before  at the time  when I 
[02:09:00]  and I  and I  and I  and I  and I  What are you eating? 
[02:09:30]  Sweet merciful crap!  It just kind of ends, huh?  Okay.  Jay!  Sounds good, Joe.  Did you see me in your parking lot?  My pod?  Yeah, did you see me in your parking lot?  Yeah, you did fine, Joe.  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  And there they go.  The worst part must have been watching those big turnip bulb heads go back and forth, swaying  clumsily to the music.  Probably the funniest goddamn thing I've ever heard in my life.  I'm sorry.  We just pulled a gag on everyone, though.  That was really airsick.  That is so funny.  That's so funny.  And when that guy would hold a note, that's the same sound he makes when he watches a kitten  get run over.  Hey!  Hey!  It's time of life! 
[02:10:30]  Chris, what's up?  Hi!  This is my parents here, Philly.  Listen to that, guys.  Absolutely hilarious.  I think you need to follow it up with Sticky's rendition of Special Olympics.  Ah, yes.  Oh, wow.  Remember that?  Thanks, Chris.  Goddamn, is that funny.  Ah, cool.  Eric, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys, this should be followed up by your man at work, you know.  The insects will get you.  Right.  I think if you combine both of them, it'll be nice.  We could give a little taste.  Nice mix.  Let's play a little taste of the insect song, okay?  Thank you.  Some people said that that was actually Rush Limbaugh singing the guy's part in that,  but this is a loss of hearing. 
[02:11:00]  Here's the insect song.  Oh, man.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  This is the insect song.  Nice.  Retard singing.  Always good.  Always.  Now he rocks.  Right? 
[02:11:30]  This one rocks a little more.  What guitar's got this kid?  You better watch out for the insects to get you.  Oh, yeah.  Rock.  You better watch out for the insects to get you.  If you accidentally fall in the water.  You're in trouble.  Oh, wow.  You better watch out for the insects to get you.  Oh, wow.  You accidentally fall in the water.  You're in trouble.  Oh, wow.  Spiders feel after you.  You better watch out for the insects to get you.  Oh, isn't there some kind of a spinal test they could do during pregnancy to rid the 
[02:12:00]  earth and rid the earth and into it.  I know that technology has come far enough.  I know that technology has come far enough for it.  But you can picture them being beaten by a garlic and the elephant man just sings? 
[02:12:30]  beat by a guy like an elephant man to sing?  Sing, sing.  Here they go.  Better watch out for the insects to get you.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Isn't that great?  Better watch out for the insects to get you.  Do we have any of the Corky?  Oh, God, and I got it all today.  This is Corky from Life Goes On.  The real retarded guy, Corky?  Singing Poison Ivy.  Singing Poison Ivy with a couple of guys that, I don't know, listen to that. 
[02:13:00]  Try to pick out where Corky comes in.  Comes out like a rose.  All right.  But anybody don't.  See, it's hard to tell.  Yeah.  She'll get you in touch.  Was that Corky or was this?  Do you look like you're dead in night time?  Poison Ivy.  Why are they doing this?  Poison Ivy.  You're late at night while you're sleeping. 
[02:13:30]  Poison Ivy comes quick.  Oh, wow.  Oh, God.  She's pretty as a daisy.  Ow.  Look at me.  It's crazy.  I'm crazy.  Don't you really do you mean?  If you're letting Andy, you're scared.  Oh.  Poison Ivy.  Great backup focus, huh?  Why are you doing that?  I don't know.  I have a disease called Down. 
[02:14:00]  Sometimes you have to just tell someone, look, you are genetic garbage juice.  Yeah.  Give it to us, Corky.  Corky, Corky.  My Poison Ivy is kind of an accurate.  You're going to need an ocean.  Oh, my God.  I'm calling my emotion.  You'll be scratching like a hound.  I have a syndrome.  It's called Down.  I have a syndrome.  I have a syndrome. 
[02:14:30]  I have a poison ivy, Anthony.  Oh, there's Corky doing Poison Ivy, Anthony.  My IQ is five.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Two guys decided they needed something to boost their musical career.  What do they need?  Corky from Life Goes On.  Woodsy, what's going on?  Hey, can I have you guys out when you guys go to hell?  Come on.  You're listening to this crap.  That is so goddamn funny, guys. 
[02:15:00]  Who the hell is deciding that retarded people singing shouldn't just be laughed at?  Do you know what would be appropriate for that when they're singing?  I'm trying to throw golf balls at them.  And I'm trying to find one more.  We got one more?  One more.  I'm trying to think of the retarded musician catalog we got, and I'm not remembering another one.  Well, one more.  I just need the cue sheet.  Do we have system of a down syndrome?  One more. 
[02:15:30]  Did they make a video?  Yeah, that would be great.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, what's up, dude?  You have to play Abu D, Abu D, by Corky.  Ah, bladda.  Ah, bladda.  There you go.  Right in the middle.  You can't even know if there any thing.  All right.  Well, I need a stall because we're looking for a cue sheet.  Rick, we need the cue sheet.  Rick.  He's actually a better singer than Ted Knight.  Ah.  Oh, yeah.  Here's Corky doing oh, bladda.  Is it?  As we look for the cue sheet.  All right. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, that's a not retarded people.  Molly gets the singing in the band.  There he is.  The singing in the band.  Desmond says to Molly, girl, I like your beat.  And Molly says that she takes it by the hand.  Oh, bladda.  Oh, bladda.  Black goes on.  Rah, la, la.  La, the light goes on.  Oh, bladda.  Oh, bladda. 
[02:16:30]  Black goes on.  Rah, la, la.  Ah, that was the three remaining Beatles.  Three-gun salute.  Well, timing is everything in comedy, so we'll give it a try anyway.  Holy S.  Well, a little musical.  I think everyone stayed out a little too late after the U2 show. 
[02:17:00]  They're not snappy today.  Anyway, another retard, Ant.  All right.  I wonder who it could be.  Another retard.  Blueberry Hill, Ted Knight, take 43.  Oh, look, it's Ted Knight.  What?  Just take 44.  That doesn't mean anything, but that's 44.  Take 43, take 44.  Can we go ahead with a Ted Knight, Blueberry Hill, take 44?  That's funny.  Ted Knight.  Ted Knight. 
[02:17:30]  I found my...  What?  Oh, it's a bit.  I'd just like to know why it has to be blueberries.  What?  Why I'm not fond of blueberries.  Can we change it to boysenberries?  I found my thrill on boysenberry hill?  Yeah.  It hasn't changed the melody, ain't it?  This is very funny. 
[02:18:00]  It's a fruit.  Yes.  No, see the song.  Okay.  That's the name of the song.  Well, what's wrong with the...  You can't...  Raspberries, then.  Oh, my God.  I don't like blueberries.  You can't help that.  The song is Blueberry Hill.  It was written as Blueberry Hill.  No.  I don't think I can sit there anymore.  It's been recorded.  It's been recorded.  It's been really bad.  This is not an original song.  You don't like blueberries?  I know the struggle.  I thought I was doing original music.  No, no.  You mean someone else already did this?  Yeah.  What the hell am I spending all this money for? 
[02:18:30]  Well, it's Blueberry Hill's an old song.  Oh, my God.  And it just goes on and on.  It's a Fats Domino.  Oh, yeah.  Why aren't we looking at a girl's breasts with flashlights on them?  Huh?  Hi.  You want my thrills?  I found my thrills.  What is it?  Oh, boy.  The old Jimmy Cagney.  Well, that.  The old Jimmy Cagney, yeah.  Elbow and ribs.  That's great.  Well, that stunk. 
[02:19:00]  A little musical break we did there.  Yeah, it started off great and...  I found my thrills.  Okay, pookie.  All right, we're going to have regrouping then.  It's in the boat.  And we'll get back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Rick, are we done with the pictures in the closet?  Yes.  Did some of them come out good?  Some of them came out great.  Really?  Yeah.  Nice.  All right, are we going to get the pictures up on Opie and Anthony.com?  Stop working on it right this second.  All right, we're going to have brand new contestants for the Booba Lantern Contest up on Opie and Anthony.com, 
[02:19:30]  hopefully in the next 15 or 20 minutes.  Okay?  And we'll bring the ladies in and see what they're all about.  Some of them are already up.  Let's see Ivy really fast.  Ivy from Privilege.  Wow, that is so bizarre.  Let me look.  There we go.  And Monroe from Privilege.  Monroe.  Yes, Monroe.  That is unbelievable, man.  How many girls showed up for the Booba Lantern Contest?  I've got one more picture to take of a girl that came in, so we've got four new ones going

Amazing.  Not weird.  They're perfect.  All right, we'll be back.  Hey, this is Jim Brewer.  Oh, yeah.  The fair is about to rock.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.

[02:21:30]  How hot are those girls?  The girls from Privilege are amazing.  They just get better and better and better.  They could press me, they're so attractive.  Privilege chicks.  Privilege Gentleman's Club.  You're all done?  Yes.  Very good.  You look very happy.  Well, you know, being a gay man to be this close to women like this is pretty exciting.  Isolate that.  You did just come out of the closet, so.  Yeah. 
[02:22:00]  No, no, it came out great.  So these girls just lit right up.  That's very cool.  Oh, wow.  What the hell is this?  The sound broker in Missy Nightly News.  The growing trend of street vendors selling pictures of the World Trade Center growing on the streets.  I would like to tell you how I feel about this, but I don't believe I can do it in socially acceptable terms.  So, I'm just going to say what I feel now. 
[02:22:30]  Any sanders that decide they want to sell pictures of the World Trade Center after thousands perished should have their heads caved in with Tom Brokaw's fifth.  I see any of these out there.  I don't care if you're a ink or a derogatory terms. 
[02:23:00]  What other derogatory terms can I use?  Well, give me a pen.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Tom Brokaw, every day nightly news.  I don't care what you are.  A goddamn, uh...  Oook.  I probably didn't say that.  Not me.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, because I...  I can't say a socially unacceptable thing about these people. 
[02:23:30]  I can call the female ones...  ...and the men...  ...suckers.  You're a little upset that they're taking advantage of, uh, the tragedy.  I can't believe, as I walk the streets to NBC Nightly News every night, that goes on at, what, 11 o'clock?  11-ish on your chronograph that I have to pass by people exploring, exploring, exploring, taking great advantage of the people that have perished. 
[02:24:00]  These...  ...ing people...  ...are nothing but...  ...ing...  ...s...  ...and...  ...suckers...  ...and...  ...holes.  I'd like to jam my...  ...so far up there.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Tom, Tom. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, no, that was shoe, that was bleeped.  I gotta tell you, you seem extra drowsy today, you alright?  I'm a little woozy from the Cipro I'm taking.  That's part of the side effects.  I read Dan Rather decided not to take any medication or be tested for anthrax because he is not caving in to the terrorists by changing his way of life.  I jumped the gun and took the Cipro and got tested for anthrax.  Now, Tom Brokaw looks like a f***ing pussy by being medicated. 
[02:25:00]  Well, I just want to go on record now and saying Dan Rather is a f***ing homo.  And I am going to start mainlining HIV, infected blood, from the f***s suckers down in the village.  That's what I'm doing, so take that Dan Rather.  You're just not taking Cipro being tested.  I'm gonna drink from the f***s. 
[02:25:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Of all the gay men.  I'm actually gonna let them f*** me right in the f***.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes, I am, Tom Brokaw.  Tom, Tom, Tom.  Yes?  Cut it out.  I can't bleep fast enough here.  Tom Brokaw is gonna allow 15 gay gentlemen to pull their f*** out.  No, no, no.  Grease them up and stick them so far in Tom Brokaw's f***.  I'm not gonna be able to f*** for a month. 
[02:26:00]  Take that, Dan Rather.  And you're doing this because Dan's getting more viewers?  It is shown that the ratings go up for us anchors if there's some imminent danger of some health problem developing.  A lot of people checking out Dan Rather because, you know, he's not gonna take the Cipro.  He may have the anthrax and they're gonna watch every night to see if anything starts growing on him.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da.  I'm gonna get a heroin-addicted Haitian bitch and have her f*** on my face. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  You can't say it.  She...  I am gonna get a heroin-addicted Haitian with the hiv.  Yeah.  I am going to run a cheese grater over my gums and stick my f*** so far up her f***.  There's gonna be blood and f*** juice flowing down my mouth.  Yes, I said f*** juice.  No, no. 
[02:27:00]  That is the juice from the f***.  Tom.  Tom, calm the f*** down, man.  That's Hamburger.  MVP Night Lane here.  Tom, Tom.  Relax.  Don't make me come over to that console and f***.  No, no.  That's okay, Tom.  I'm infected and I don't care.  Why'd you go into...  Uh, we're here.  Why'd you go into the clock?  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  NBC Nightly News.  This just in.  Dan Rather can go f*** himself. 
[02:27:30]  Me, Hamburger, NBC Nightly News, is gonna run 15 grit sandpaper over my f***.  And then f***.  Oh, wait.  And then...  The living f***.  Out of...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  And then I'm gonna f*** her until my f*** spews f*** all over f***.  And then...  I won't even lube up her f*** when I f*** with my f***. 
[02:28:00]  Tombrow, NBC Nightly News.  No, no, no, no, no.  Look, I have a shanker on my lipp already.  I see that.  I am having so much sexual activity, unprotected.  Please tune in as I give you a blow-by-blow.  Oh, wait, a description.  I don't know if I can say it in that context.  A description of my sex that I'm having with all kinds of gay men  and heroin-addicted women using dirty needles. 
[02:28:30]  Ah, it.  Dan Rather.  Ink pussy.  Lots of jealousy, Tom.  It's not jealousy.  Lots of jealousy.  I was the first one to have the alphax problem.  So people tuned in.  I showed them the ship roll.  I showed them that I was being tested.  And then Dan Rather has to one-up me by deciding, oh, I'm not taking it.  And where are those pictures I was supposed to see?  Dan Rather.  Goddamn Dan Rather. 
[02:29:00]  Tony.  Yo.  What's up, Tony?  Hey, what's up?  Listen, I don't know if you noticed this, but right when he's talking about how he had a bad time sitting down after everything had happened  and he's poured himself a glass of scotch?  A big water glass full of scotch.  Yeah.  If you listen to it, right before he says scotch, it sounds like he wants to say liquor.  Listen to it.  Listen to it.  Now you're going to have to listen.  I put myself a big glass of scotch. 
[02:29:30]  A lot of scotch at 9 or 915.  Yeah, so I didn't know if you guys ever caught that or if you pointed out, but that's, again,  you can't say liquor.  So I can't say liquor, but bring your girlfriend over here.  I'll show how I liquor her.  Hey, you guys are doing a great job.  I'm over here in Philly, and I listen to you guys every chance I get.  Philly, very kind to us.  Thanks, Tony.  Hey, thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  All right, and we got the clip?  Let's listen if he's trying to say liquor, and then he goes to scotch. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Oh, to scotch?  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Adrenaline is a very strong drug.  You know, I was pumped up, and I would go home and sleep very little and wake up.  How do you even get to sleep if you're obviously that pumped up?  Well, the first night I went home, I came on the air at about 915 in the morning with Katie  and Matt on the Today Show, and then just stayed on until about 2 in the morning, went  home, and, you know, it was fair to say that I was wired, so I thought the way to deal 
[02:30:30]  with this is with the liquor's full of scotch.  And, uh...  This is a good message for the young people out there.  Yeah.  A big glass of scotch.  I hear Dan Rather drinks a daiquiri, that f***ing pussy.  He's a faggot.  No, you don't know that.  This just says Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, Dan Rather, faggot.  No, you don't know that.  Join me at 11 on the time device. 
[02:31:00]  Tom, you don't know that.  Oh, no, I know.  I f***ed him last night.  He's got the old Dan Rather yam bags hanging like clit clacks.  Remember clit clacks?  They hang down like that.  Do your f*** hang low to the wobble to and throw?  Can you tie them in a knot?  Can you tie them in a bow?  Oh, are they big as Dan Rather's?  That f***ing fag.  Do your f*** hang low. 
[02:31:30]  His f*** tastes like a dirty penny.  Let's just stand.  Dan Rather's f***ing hole.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no, slow down.  I meant the...  Well, yes, I did mean the f***ing...  Okay, sorry.  I said I had a hard time describing this in socially acceptable f***ing terms.  Come on, I have anthrax.  Please cut me some f***ing slack.  Slack here. 
[02:32:00]  Tumblr, NBC Nightly News.  Dan Rather likes a good f***ing.  Larry from D.C.  Which will come sooner?  The end of this bit or like rashes on Dan Rather's face?  He's got those chankers.  I actually like taking a...  You ever see the small kitchen device used to skin care? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Peeler.  Peeler.  Peeler.  I like taking one of those, jamming it in my...  and twisting it around in a circle so as to break a lot of blood vessels right there.  So blood is pouring out my f***ing, right?  You get me?  And then I let Haitians, peelers I call, Haitian peelers with all cheesy gunk and whatnot,  and I'm sure disease, just slam it so far in that bloody f***ing, 
[02:33:00]  that I scream, quite frankly, in pain.  But I know that I will get diseases Dan Rather has no chance of contracting  and get the rating that I need to beat that f***.  Dan Rather, a Peeler.  Listen to NBC Nightly News, Dan's a Peeler.  I'm trying to save you from a lawsuit.  You do not know that Dan Rather's a Peeler.  I cranked out a batch on Dan's back last night.  It looked like a map of the Philippines. 
[02:33:30]  Hey, I didn't have to bleep one word.  Tom Broker, MBC Night Live.  James, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I work in a bio-level 3 facility at an Ivy League school down here at Harvard.  Yeah.  And it's hard not to get infected when I'm working with the TV because you guys are so damn funny.  Wait, you're on the TV?  You got a gas mask on? 
[02:34:00]  You're listening to us?  No, no, I'm coming home from work.  But, yeah, I wear a mask and, you know, I got to laugh and stuff.  It's hard.  All right.  Hard laughing with a gas mask.  Try laughing with anthrax or with Dan Rather's in your...  Try that, sonny boy.  Harvard.  Don't the girls take the truck to Harvard?  Isn't that what happens up in Boston?  And they like having sex in the...  Because it keeps their inversions. 
[02:34:30]  They take the bus, Wellesley.  From Wellesley College up in Boston.  Yeah.  And they call it the truck.  It's the truck, I know.  I drank a tall glass of scotch and chased it with Dan Rather's...  Mmm.  Mmm, because it tastes good?  That's what I said.  Oh, mmm, mmm.  It's mmm, mmm, good.  That's what a camel's poop is. 
[02:35:00]  And Dan's...  Is...  Mmm, mmm, good.  Hamburg NBC Nightly News.  Okay.  You ever do that thing with a straw?  Dan loves that one.  I...  I go...  Allegedly...  I pump out a...  And then I insert the straw and suck it right out of...  That's right, out of...  You heard it. 
[02:35:30]  Let me say one more time...  We sure know how to drive a...  Being bit into the ground.  We sure do.  Tom Brogan.  We sure do.  NBC Nightly News.  Can't wait to get...  Get...  In that...  Of Peter Jennings.  He's got manly abs, doesn't he, Peter Jennings?  I don't care what disease I get, as long as it's better than Dan Rather's disease. 
[02:36:00]  Hey, Bill O'Reilly, bend over.  I'm driving home tonight.  Tom Brogan, NBC.  Let's get you out of here.  Nightly, you...  Sucking...  Son of a...  Bat...  Egg...  I'm a...  It's a good night.  That one was way too close.  You can't do the... 
[02:36:30]  After the...  No, you can't.  It's a cag.  Oh, my God.  You can't do that.  All right, well.  We'll play What Do We Learned next, and we've got to say hi to the girls.  From Privilege.  Yes.  Privilege Gentleman's Club.  Helping us out with the Booble Lantern Contest today.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Own a float, baby!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah.  Sure.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.

Brand new contestants in the Booble Lantern Contest.  Ladies with breast implants, come down tomorrow between 3 and 7 in the New York area.

All the rules and everything else you need to know about the Booble Lantern Contest, up  on opieandanthony.com.  Want to play a quick round of what did we learn on the O&A Show today?  Some people, very perceptive.  I learned that Anthony's drunk mom is singing karaoke.  Wow.  That's really good.  Anthony, what's up?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, man. 
[02:38:00]  Hey, I learned...  Oh!  What?  Can we end with your mom singing tonight, Ant?  We haven't played that long.  You know something?  That is a good one.  We're going to end with that tonight.  Sorry, Anthony.  Yeah, I learned retort singing and bajiricate.  Always, always funny.  Bajiricate.  Norton, you rule.  Thank you.  All right.  Norton rocks.  Thank you.  No, I think Anthony rocked today.  No offense to Norton, but...  He's speaking in general terms.  Oh.  But I rock in general terms.  Over the long haul.  All right, then.  Vito, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys? 
[02:38:30]  Hey.  Hey, man.  I learned that recent Tom Brokaw's bits and tested emergency broadcast system are quite similar.  Yeah, quite.  You.  Keep your chin up.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Wow, Vito.  Wow, Vito.  There it is.  There's something about that line that is just hilarious.  Keep your chin up.  We're going to turn this thing around.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Melon, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Your toolbar.  Melon.  Hey, what's up?  I learned that syndication blows. 
[02:39:00]  Hey, I hope he did say that today.  Syndication does blow.  Syndication blows.  I'm going to keep it up.  All right.  Bye.  I've got to deal with more than one station that doesn't know what they're doing.  Dennis, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  I learned two things.  I learned that AHL games and minor league football preempts ONA in Chicago and Washington.  And I learned Anthony would like to beat up foreign vendors trying to exploit tragedy.  There you go.  Very good.  Later, boys.  Stinky rules.  All right.  Stinky does rule, short-term and long-term. 
[02:39:30]  Did Stinky really rule today, though?  Not today.  Yeah, I guess, yeah, Stinky's a hold.  Stinky's a strong hold.  I'll be honest.  I can never think of a day where Garrett has ruled.  Really?  Not one day.  You don't think of a day that Garrett has ruled?  Dude, he gets our guests high, and then they give us good stuff on the radio.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Rick, we'll be trying to book Kevin Bacon. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Very good.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  We've got to end with Ant's mom singing.  All right.  Do it up.  Really?  Cracker Bones and does all the things little boys do.  Hey, we've got to call him P-Boy.  You just named that character, Nate.  P-Boy.  That's P-Boy.  That's all I call him.  It's easier to say.  Yes.  I'm just an animal kid.  I also learned Tom Brokaw uses a straw. 
[02:40:30]  You guys, Norton rules.  All right.  Norton rules.  Cliff, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Arnie?  Hey, man.  Help us turn this thing around.  Let's go.  Turn it around.  Yeah, I learned that the Jim Brokaw is always funny.  Ah.  Yeah, just when I thought it couldn't get funnier.  It got funnier, man.  Something happened.  Yeah, no kidding.  All right.  Norton rules.  See you guys later.  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's up? 
[02:41:00]  I learned that with graham cracker legs and saltine cracker mitts and an eggshell hell,  I can still play baseball and ride a bicycle.  Eggshell leg.  But he's a normal kid.  That's right.  I hope to see you guys on Monday up in Boston.  I want to take care of you guys.  Thank you.  Hey, you got tickets for the Grave Rave?  I don't, but I'm going to be behind the studios after work, buddy.  Would you like Grave Rave tickets?  I would like Grave Rave tickets.  All right.  Hold on the line, my friend.  Thank you.  Okay.  There goes Mike.  Everyone loves the little P-boy kid.  I love that bit.  That's my fave. 
[02:41:30]  Grayson, I think.  Grayson.  That's a cool name.  What's up, man?  What's up today?  I learned that Tom Brokaw doesn't know when to shut up.  And I just learned that Greedy sucks.  Greedy sucks.  What sucks?  Greedy.  All right.  All right.  Hey, guys.  Very good of you.  Cut your losses that time.  I didn't during that freaking retard singing bit, though.  I'll think about that tonight.  Went too far with the Ted Knight.  Note to self.  Note to self. 
[02:42:00]  Didn't need Ted Knight.  Should have went with Aunt's Mom singing.  Closer to retard sounding.  Or Jesse Camp.  Jesse Camp next time would have worked much better to finish off that bit.  Stupid radio host.  Stupid radio host.  Today I learned if you have garbage juice DNA, you shouldn't sing.  Not even in the shower.  Garbage juice.  Today I learned Tom Brokaw should say the word allegedly a lot more.  Camel soup is mm-mm good. 
[02:42:30]  I learned that Mad Dog has a disease that makes him look 96.  That's right, Mikey.  Yeah, Mikey's my friend.  A normal kid.  We go out of the playground.  Now he's right from Tawara.  Hey, can we get the girls in from Privileged Gentleman's Club?  Yeah, bring them in quickly.  And then we got in with Aunt's Mom.  Yeah, Mom was drunk one night and went back to the house.  My brother's there.  She wanted to sing a song.  Yeah.  So my brother's got all the recording studio equipment.  So in a few minutes, we'll hear my drunken mother trying to sing. 
[02:43:00]  What was she trying to sing?  Mercedes-Benz.  Oh, Mercedes-Benz.  Mercedes-Benz.  Look at how believable these girls are.  Wow.  Lovely, lovely girls.  Yeah, you don't see this every day.  Is this the new crop at Privileged Gentleman's Club?  The new crop.  Listen to you.  You guys are beautiful.  Who's the spokesperson here?  Who's the...  Wow.  Nice.  Look at this one, just taking her shirt on.  I like it.  Got that nice red bra on. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, hey there.  Yellow.  All these girls are entered in the Blantern Contest.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  I think she likes me.  You think so, Norton?  Do you think Norton rules?  Oh, my God.  Do you think Norton rules?  In general.  Wow.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  That's extraordinary.  You have a very...  I must say.  Wow.  Holy ass.  We have nothing to say. 
[02:44:00]  They're too nice.  So, how's it going, guys?  Great.  We're doing well.  How are you doing?  I'm feeling kind of, you know, mountainous right now.  Yeah.  How about you?  Sure.  Any mountains going in your region?  The same.  Oh, look at this now.  Everyone's taking their clothes off.  Even Jim Norton.  Jim?  All right, all right, all right.  All right, all right.  Jim, why don't you take your clothes off and join the girls?  Put it back between my legs and me.  Oh, now the red bras come off.  Hey, wow.  There we go.  Ah, yeah.  I can't decide who my favorite is. 
[02:44:30]  That's great.  We got a Southwest lady here.  Where are you from?  We got a brilliant lady here.  Brazil.  I, myself, I'm from the...  Carnival.  I'm from the Pacific Northwest.  Yeah.  We have a butterfly here.  What part?  What part?  What part?  What part of the...  Maybe, maybe.  Yeah.  Seattle.  We're on in Seattle.  One more time, please.  And what?  Oh, she's skinner.  That's what I'm going to do to a rather tonight.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right. 
[02:45:00]  So all your pictures were taken.  Flashlight.  Everything nice.  Yeah, they came out great.  Is this like normal for you guys or not?  I have naked girls in here?  Yeah.  Not this...  I must say.  Usually they're...  You guys have the best job.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Tell me about it.  You should see some of the stuff we have to see, though.  Usually they're very skanky.  Oh.  And then we will have to pay with eternal damnation of our soul.  But for now, it's a real tip now.  For the short term, it's great.  As Satan is using his multi-headed on us for eternity, an eternity of being by Satan, that 
[02:45:30]  might...  I think after a few billion years, that might get annoying.  And you might think back and go, gee, was it really worth having a cool job?  I just hope my memory holds up when he's doing that to me.  Yeah.  But for now, it's a pip.  It's a pip, right.  You guys got something going on at Privileged Gentleman's Club tonight?  Tonight, go down to Privileged Gentleman's Club.  This was written in crayon, Anthony.
