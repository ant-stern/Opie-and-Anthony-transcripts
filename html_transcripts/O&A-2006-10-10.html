<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic bit about a rage-inducing viral infection before launching into a detailed and highly critical account of their experience at an XM Satellite Radio "Artist Confidential" event featuring Sting.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, were profoundly disappointed by Sting's performance, which unexpectedly focused on 16th-century lute music by John Dowland (repeatedly mispronounced). They described the music as monotonous and boring, highlighting Sting's perceived lack of audience engagement and the mismatch between the performance and the expectations of fans hoping for Police-related material.  Anecdotes included Opie's need for two photos with Sting and the awkward silence following the performance.  The show also covered other topics, including the inadequacy of radio station slogans, reactions of other attendees to Sting’s performance, listener calls commenting on Sting and other issues,  their opinions on the New York Yankees and Joe Torre, and the juxtaposition of that news with North Korea's potential nuclear detonation. A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to humorous (and often explicit) anecdotes about a dominatrix and her interactions with the hosts. The segment closed with further commentary on Sting's performance and a brief audio clip of lute music.


A subsequent segment began with a caller questioning the originality of a commercial, comparing it to a bit from an Andrew Dice Clay HBO special.  The hosts, including Kenny, discussed the similarities, concluding it wasn't a direct rip-off.  This transitioned into a discussion of listener calls, described as unusually subdued, which then segued into a graphic discussion about Karen Von Croft, a dominatrix, and her online videos. This led to a lengthy and explicit exploration of various sexual role-playing scenarios, fantasies, and listener experiences, often involving extreme dominance and submission.  Callers shared humorous and sometimes disturbing anecdotes, including one describing a brutal encounter with a dominatrix and another recounting an awkward role-playing experience with his girlfriend.  The conversation also touched upon unusual fetishes, including a “plushie” fetish, eliciting negative reactions from the hosts.  One caller recounted a bizarre incident involving a woman using her infant child as a weapon.  The latter half of this segment featured an interview with Lewis, a guest with Tourette's Syndrome, promoting his upcoming appearance on MTV's "True Life."  Kenny apologized to Lewis on air for past tensions. The segment concluded with the hosts and Lewis sampling a new energy drink called "Cocaine."


A further segment included a phone call with actor Jeff Daniels, who discussed his career, his experiences working with Meryl Streep, and his new live and unplugged CD benefiting his Purple Rose Theater.  This led to a discussion about the Detroit Tigers' World Series win.  Later, Twitchels, another guest with Tourette's Syndrome, joined the show.  Opie and Anthony encouraged Twitchels to consume a cocaine-mixed drink, resulting in increasingly erratic behavior.  John Cena, promoting *The Marine*, was interviewed by Twitchels in a bizarre and comedic exchange.  The segment concluded with the Opie and Anthony crew's move to their XM studio, further interaction with Cena, and attempts at the "window game." The conversation was laced with vulgar jokes and offensive references.


Another segment showcased a staged scene where a woman repeatedly kicked a man in the testicles, escalating to the inclusion of racial slurs before each kick. Multiple takes were needed due to the man's reluctance and the woman's missed lines. The man was a wrestling fan who had won a chance to meet John Cena.  The hosts then discussed the comedic value of the scene.  John Cena was a guest, promoting his movie and discussing his wrestling career, rapping persona, and censorship issues in the WWE.  Other topics included Bill O'Reilly's comments on the show, North Korea's nuclear testing, and wrestling history.  Jimmy Norton participated throughout.  "The Dump Report" with Club Soda Kenny featured darkly humorous stories about a zone chef finding a dead elderly woman and a businessman accidentally killing a prostitute. The show included frequent vulgar language and crude humor.


The final segment opened with a graphic, darkly humorous story about a businessman accidentally killing a hooker while in a bunny suit.  The hosts and callers embellished the story with increasingly absurd and vulgar details.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of a press release announcing a radio advertising campaign for the "Original Soup Man" featuring Opie and Anthony.  The hosts then reacted to Sting's appearance on the Today Show, heavily criticizing his performance and demeanor using vulgar and derogatory language.  A clip from the Today Show was played, further mocking Sting.  The final segment featured an interview with Jonathan Black, author of "Yes You Can," critiquing the motivational speaking industry.  The conversation covered various motivational speakers, interspersed with jokes and off-topic comments.  Technical difficulties interrupted the interview. The segment concluded with the announcement of the "Line of the Day" winner.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202  featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Right from the beginning you knew this was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease,  fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities,  it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates, and kills this fast.  These numbers can't be right. 
[00:00:30]  The numbers aren't correct.  I wish to God they weren't.  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  Such a great virus that you want to infect others,  like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God Almighty.  We need to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place. 
[00:01:00]  All right.  We're coming out.  Here we go.  I'm a boredom.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Today on the program, we're going to dedicate three hours. 
[00:01:30]  We're going to count down the top ten lutenists of all time. 
[00:02:00]  Lutenists.  Who do you think is the greatest lute player of all time?  Do we have to really have to stick to this century or can we go to centuries past?  I'd suggest the 15th century.  Yeah.  I think we cut off.  The cutoff point here is the 15th century.  Actually.  Up till today.  Actually, the 16th century produced some of the greatest luteists of all time, Anthony. 
[00:02:30]  Well.  Oh, you're talking to the audience.  Okay.  Because I thought if you were talking to us, we'd sit here and laugh and go, of course.  Tell us something we don't know.  And the sky is blue.  So we really can't cut it off because there was a famous luteist named John Dowling that  lived during the late 1500s and was a fine writer and he traveled around and he was a  bitter, bitter luteist because he wasn't picked to play for the queen at the time. 
[00:03:00]  Are you going to run through first grade mathematics after this, Opie, too?  Because, you know, I think our listeners obviously know this stuff.  A very, very bitter luteist because he didn't get the job with the queen.  That job went to, I believe, Rob Johnson.  Yeah, Rob.  Yes.  Johnson.  But not the one that.  Not the blues legend because, of course, they wouldn't allow a black luteist back in 
[00:03:30]  the late 1500s.  There weren't any black people back then.  Looters.  They were called looters, right.  Right.  Not to be confused with the luteist.  Ech!  Wow.  Play one for us, thing!  Ain't going to happen.  I cannot be happier.  Let me just say, I could not be happier that I did not attend this debacle.  This debacle. 
[00:04:00]  Here's another song by John Dowling I'm going to sing that sounds just like Silent Night.  Matter of fact, every song I'm playing for you tonight sounds like Silent Night.  Is that really what went down?  I was expecting freaking fake snow to start falling from the ceiling.  We, uh...  You didn't make a bad move, Ant.  Let me just do the quick setup.  After the program yesterday, we were invited to that fine, what is it called over there? 
[00:04:30]  The Lincoln Jazz Center.  The Lincoln Jazz Center.  In the Time Warner building.  They have an amazing performance center where the backdrop is Central Park and New York City.  That's beautiful.  The curtain goes up.  Oh.  And it's actually moving cars behind the luteist.  And you see Central Park.  Unfortunately, it wasn't moving through the window.  And you see the buildings and some kind of a harvest moon was happening. 
[00:05:00]  We were invited to see what Sting is up to today.  And the reason why he doesn't want to get back together with the police.  That sounds exciting.  Sting, you're going to hear a lot of the hits with his new band.  And Sting's voice was a huge part of the police.  So nothing against the rest of the police.  The other two gentlemen, we've had them on this program.  They were very nice.  But I'm sure if Sting wanted to throw together a band and do police songs, 
[00:05:30]  it would sound very similar to the old police because his voice, very distinctive voice.  Yeah, I would have went for some solo Sting.  Of course.  You know, I would have went for anything.  If I ever lose my faith in you.  Just blurt one out, sure.  Right.  So this was part of XM's Artist Confidential.  They do an amazing program over there at XM where they get these artists in.  And they sit them down and they chat in front of a live audience. 
[00:06:00]  And then the artist will, you know, perform as well.  It's very unique.  And then people go, hey, confidentially, that sucked.  Sting sucked.  You know, and because there's no worry of ratings, some of these artists get to do what they've always wanted to do.  Because they don't have to worry about the commercial success of something.  Right.  So you'll get someone like Roger Waters playing opera songs.  You'll get Paul McCartney banging on paint cans, you know, whatever. 
[00:06:30]  Conducting an orchestra.  He's sick with two legs.  Right.  Yeah.  Conducting an orchestra.  That's what I hear he's doing.  Oh, really?  I thought that as a goof.  Paul McCartney, I believe Carnegie Hall, is going to conduct two songs as an orchestra plays Beatles songs.  But at least they're Beatles songs.  And you're looking at Paul McCartney.  Yeah.  Even that you can justify. 
[00:07:00]  Like, okay, it's Beatles songs.  But now you're evening with Sting.  You can't justify Paul McCartney just running the orchestra.  I'm saying above and beyond what stupid Sting did.  Yeah, but at least he was using his instrument, his God-given instrument.  That would be his voice.  You're hearing yesterday.  Look, man, I'm with you.  Done by an entire orchestra.  And you're looking at Paul McCartney.  He's not uttering a peep.  He's got a little stick in his hand, probably card from the wood of his ex-wife. 
[00:07:30]  And he's waving it around and conducting an orchestra.  That's fine because I'll know in my head I'll hear.  Great.  Great.  Oh, great.  That's like getting the hottest porn star in America.  Oh, and she ain't doing anything, but she's directing.  A fat couple.  Well.  While the hot porn star does some knitting in the corner.  At least I know the song.  But you can imagine what the hot porn star would do.  But McCartney didn't walk. 
[00:08:00]  Once you learn McCartney, at least McCartney didn't walk away.  At least you, like, McCartney ran his string with the Beatles.  So you can go, all right, I've seen that completed work, so it's not as bad watching him conduct  as it is with Sting.  Right.  He just waltzed off in the middle of everything.  So Jimmy and I and Anthony were invited to this artist confidential that XM was doing at  Lincoln Center last night, and we've been talking about this behind the scenes off and  on for a couple of weeks, maybe longer.  And stupid me, I'm like, wow, that's going to be really cool to see, you know, Sting  artist confidential.  He's obviously going to talk about the police because, like I said, it's a sit-down interview. 
[00:08:30]  Maybe give us a little insight on the breakup.  Maybe a little insight on whether or not the police would ever reunite.  You know, I got to tell you, the police, when I was growing up, was it for me, one of the  big bands I followed.  So I was very frustrated when they called it quits at the height of their success.  So then as we're getting closer to this night with Sting last night, there's rumors and chit-chatter. 
[00:09:00]  Chatter.  Chatter.  Chatter.  We're starting to hear, he doesn't want to talk about the police, he doesn't want to  play police songs, he doesn't want to play any Sting songs.  He wants to dedicate the hour to playing The Lute.  What a self-serving, self-centered, self-important, blow-off-the-fans ass.  The Lute?  The Lute. 
[00:09:30]  The Lute is the poor man's guitar.  The Lute?  It's ancient.  Is one of those, you know, I can't even explain it.  It sounds like a faggy guitar is what it does.  It's what you hear behind, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  That foodie thing.  Yeah.  And like the maraca things and bells.  Things from the Renaissance-y time.  Right.  Picture old school like Christmas songs.  The music you hear right before a guillotine comes down. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  The music you hear as they pull some of your relatives out of the house because they succumb to the Black Plague.  And they're ripping out your entrails before you yell freedom.  Right.  Right.  Strapped to a table.  That's what you hear.  So we get all dressed up and we go to this Artist Confidential at Lincoln Center last night.  And we get to meet the man.  Boy, that was a treat.  Sorry that my camera didn't work and I needed a second picture, Sting. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, no.  Sorry I didn't bother you too much.  No way.  Hope I didn't bother you too much.  You ought to get the second picture.  Was Jimmy laughing because he's such a professional?  Mm-hmm.  Like, Jimmy is such a pro at making sure everything's set up and ready to go.  Did you chuckle at Opie having to take another?  No, it was a pressure-free meeting, really, because we were brought in to a green room and we met him.  It wasn't like, you know, you had to run up and grab him in the hallway.  So you had a couple seconds to adjust. 
[00:11:00]  It wasn't that, you know, you weren't going to be ushered out immediately.  Yeah.  You had a second.  To chit-chat?  No, just say hello.  I said hello.  Got my picture.  You said hello.  I got my copy of the Police DVD by Stuart Copeland signed by the third and final member.  I got one for a young Eric signed.  Did he look at all like he was annoyed signing that thing?  No.  No.  Especially when I just added it to an article, he had to go, yeah, it's for a charity auction.  Lied.  Of course you lied.  That is for you.  Yes, it is.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  That'll be framed.  So we all got our pictures with Sting.  Before the show.  Yeah, before the show.  I had to go back a second time.  And I'll bring my pictures in maybe tomorrow.  And you can tell how annoyed he is because he had to do it a second time.  And I apologized a million times.  Sorry that this is such a hassle.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry this is very stressful for you.  It wasn't like he was doing a meet and greet for thousands of people, hundreds of people.  There was maybe 20 people.  I mean, the whole thing took, if he was in there 15 minutes, I'd be surprised.  That's it? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So then we sit down and we get ready for the Sting Artist Confidential.  I'm hoping to get some samples of this fine night within the next day or two.  Please.  I've got to hear this.  Thank God I wasn't there.  So he walks out on the stage with this Lutonist player that I guess is the greatest Lutonist player out there.  He's a guitarist.  He's a guitarist.  No, I never heard of it put that way.  That's why America is...  Is it pronounced Lutonist? 
[00:12:30]  That's why America is great.  We looked around and saw what the rest of the world was doing and we took that and made it better.  Someone saw that these lutes were out there and went, this is a pain in the neck.  There's too many strings.  It's bulky.  It's like the Nicholson goes on a left turn out of nowhere and someone decided, you know what, I'm going to take this Lutonist and I'm going to make it better.  But it's not called a Lutonist.  Huh?  It's not called a Lutonist.  It's called Lutonist.  Or Lutonist.  No, I have no idea. 
[00:13:00]  But if it's called Lutonist, I really hate this instrument.  Yeah, I think...  Where did the Luton come in?  I don't...  I think if you play the Lutonist, you're a Lutonist.  We're not a Lutonist, right?  Who made that up?  You're Gerard Depardieu, because that's who he looked like.  Just a creepy, fat French actor punched over a bent guitar.  And he did not want to be in America.  He wanted to be where they appreciate what he does.  Of course.  This is somewhere deep in Germany.  Then leave.  Somewhere deep in Germany. 
[00:13:30]  And then Sting comes out and they interview him about his latest CD, because this is going to be out on CD, I guess.  Of course it is.  And I guess he sings the songs of John Dowling, who was one of the most famous Lutonists  of all time.  He lived in the late 1500s.  And Sting proceeded to spend an hour reading letters from John Dowling, where the lights  would dramatically drop so he could read another letter about John Dowling's travels through  Europe back in the late 1500s. 
[00:14:00]  Dude, how did you sit there?  How did you sit there?  After five minutes, you're like, all right, I've committed.  I've heard enough of this dreck.  You already have your picture, right?  Yes, that was exactly what I should have left.  You have your picture.  Why would you sit there and give this guy an ego trip?  I'm not going to...  He didn't...  He kind of billed it as what it was.  He didn't claim he was going to do what he didn't do.  That's why I didn't say he would think it was self-care. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, but we...  He said he was going to do that, and that was what he wanted to do.  I don't think the people there knew that, though.  Oh, really?  We knew because we were lucky enough to know the people that were putting the thing on.  You're an insider.  Because there were regular fans there, too, and you've got to think they were expecting  a little something police-oriented.  Yeah.  In all fairness, at the end, he did Fields of Gold and Message in a Bottle on the loot.  On the loot, though.  On the loot.  Get a goddamn drummer and guitarist in there and do the songs. 
[00:15:00]  I bought the greatest hits.  I was so bothered by that.  The original bottle was very slow.  I had to go out and just buy it.  That's why he did that, by the way, to sell a few greatest hits.  I heard Roland on the elevator yesterday was saying he does Message in a Bottle, but  it's such a completely, ridiculously slowed down, really, you can't even identify it  as Message in a Bottle.  Oh, he's doing it on his latest CD?  I don't know.  All right.  We'll have to find out.  We'll have to get it.  Roland's heard it.  Well, we'll get the performance from last night. 
[00:15:30]  We'll play Message in a Bottle as he did it on the loot.  And we're sitting there and he's dramatically reading these letters and then his voice is  almost like not recognizable because he's doing it in the style of John Dowling and how  I guess how he used to sing.  How the frick would he know how he sounded?  Church music.  That's how they say it.  It was pretty much church music.  Yeah.  It was pretty much Christmas music.  Every song sounded like it was a Christmas song.  But there was no tape back then. 
[00:16:00]  They kind of know.  Did he put an affectation on his voice?  It was just what it sounded like.  Well, he's British.  He didn't need to.  Yeah.  And then they're playing these songs.  They play the first one and no one knows how a loot song is supposed to end.  So like the song ends and everyone's just like, uh, uh, and it was dramatically silent  for 10 or 15 seconds because people really don't know that the song ended.  Clap or something.  And all of a sudden, you could just feel everyone.  And then they had to like lower the lights to pretty much tell the audience the song was 
[00:16:30]  over.  And then everyone like, uh, no, but I think this guy used to be cool.  Horrid how you sat there.  Yeah.  And gave, fed this guy.  His voice sounded good for what it was.  I mean, I didn't like what he was singing, but he sounded good.  Sting's voice sounds good.  Singing police song.  By the way, Jim from Maryland.  Opie, it's John Dowlin.  You F get it straight.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[00:17:00]  Sorry.  I was, I was on my way to tower records.  I would have been searching in the D's all day.  Cause I don't know his, uh, his name.  And by the way, who, who said that?  Uh, Jim, uh, whatever your name is.  Obviously you popped the name into, uh, Google or Yahoo and loot.  And the name came up and the name came up and it came up Dowland.  So you didn't know either.  Jim Loeffler from Maryland, Jim Loeffler. 
[00:17:30]  Why don't you just laugh at the show and shut up?  Wayne from Philadelphia.  The music, the lobster hand midget sings to himself is, uh, yes.  It's the music of the loot.  Hoodily do.  It's a little flipper hand.  Hoodily do.  Another instrument he'll never be able to play.  The loot.  Yeah.  The picture of the midget trying to get into a cab here in New York is on opianthony.com.  It's quite funny.  Headbutt it.  Opie, you're a effing idiot.  America's great because we made a guitar.  How about Italy in 1700, you jackass? 
[00:18:00]  Oh, stop it.  All right, whatever.  Like that was the kind of guitar that, uh, people are using.  Who knows?  The wonderful people.  Who knows?  Like Les Paul.  So then he continues, uh, through the, the songs of John Dowland and, uh, and, uh, he  had, uh, this guy, you know, playing the, the lead loot and I guess, uh, I guess Sting  was playing up loot.  I guess Sting was playing more of a bass type loot.  I don't know.  Who knows?  No one knows.  So now people are starting to feel comfortable that, uh, they know when these loot songs end. 
[00:18:30]  How funny was it near the end of the, uh, end of the, uh, you know, performance, the  song kind of drops, drops down and sounds like it ends.  So the place starts going nuts.  The lead looters gets so pissed that he raises his hand really hard to the audience.  Like, ah, I'm not done.  Ah, how dare you?  They don't do this in Europe.  Kidding.  He put his arm up dramatically.  Look back down at the loot.  There was silence for another five or six seconds. 
[00:19:00]  And then they finally go to the last part of the song.  And then it finally ends.  But of course we wrecked that performance of the song because like in Europe, of course,  people understand silence and understand the songs and understand what the Lutonist was  doing.  You gotta just yell out.  Hey, idiot.  We don't know when this crap ends.  The guy was so, so pissed off.  Right in the middle of his song.  Pissed off.  Get thrown out.  It'd be you doing yourself a favor.  Hey, jerk off.  We don't know when this crap ends.  Of course we're a part. 
[00:19:30]  Don't put your hand up to me.  You're a Nazi.  I was with Elo.  One good point.  I was with Elo.  He's got one good point.  I was with Elo and I was making believe I was pushing the buttons like I do on the show.  Ant and I both have an instant replay.  And I know exactly where the buttons I always use are.  Boring.  Yeah, so I'm like, I'm doing this.  But whispering to Elo, this would be when I would play this.  Boring.  Boring.  This is where the crickets would come in.  This is where Kelsey Grammer would come in.  All I was thinking of, and I was going to laugh out loud if I kept thinking about it, was 
[00:20:00]  this sucks.  That was all.  This sucks.  I hear that clip.  Did anyone have that?  I've been dying to hear that since last night.  If anyone has the button.  Yeah, I don't know.  I've got to find it.  Please find it.  But, Opie, the modern guitar was invented in Spain, not America.  Hoo-hoo, I invented the guitar, Robin.  All right, whatever.  But I think you get the point here.  I think you get the point.  I think we kind of make things much better here in America.  We kind of borrow and steal from the rest of the country, or the rest of the world, I 
[00:20:30]  should say.  So it leads to this.  So then you're sitting there going, how about one for us, Sting?  You want to yell that out.  Because like I was telling Anthony in the back office, he can do whatever the hell he wants,  obviously.  But the reason he's at Lincoln Center experimenting with John Dowland's music and attempting to  master this lute playing is because of the fame he had in the police.  So he owes it to the public to do something. 
[00:21:00]  And thank God he did.  Because I guess there was a lot of talking behind the scenes, because he did not want  to do anything.  He wanted to just dedicate the whole night to him, just playing the lute and doing these  songs by John Dowland.  This sucks.  And finally, he did, like we said, Message in a Bottle, Fields of Cold.  This sucks.  Dude, that's all I was thinking of, and I was howling to myself how funny that would have  been a little loudspeaker.  And what was the blues song?  Hell's Hellhound or something like that?  I didn't hear that either.  By Rob Johnson.  Who would? 
[00:21:30]  And then, you know, he got a standing, a standing.  Oh, he did not get a standing.  Yeah, I stood to.  Drew from PA.  Boring.  Is this crap supposed to get me out of bed?  All I'm doing is hitting snooze.  Then go listen to something else.  I didn't hate him for doing it.  I kind of like the fact that he walked out of the police, because there's such an arrogance  in that.  And he doesn't, you know, what does he care?  He's like an artist, man.  He just can do what he wants.  I guess he's a true artist.  No, he really is.  I mean, look, the guy doesn't need the money. 
[00:22:00]  He just, he did something.  Anyone that has to go to 16th Century Songs, and he knows he can just get with the police  and sell out J Stadium, but he'd rather be sitting in Lincoln Center with some horrible  thin-haired Nazi playing lute songs.  You've got to kind of respect the art of that.  I did say that to Elo.  I'm like, creatively, you've got to respect that, because he did say something about he  likes to put himself in uncomfortable positions and then see what happens.  Yeah.  I guess I could respect that.  Yeah.  He don't want to do the same thing he's been doing for all those years.  But it's just like, what? 
[00:22:30]  You're going back to what?  To do what?  Don't need to put us in uncomfortable positions.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm fine in your basement.  Don't make us applaud for this crap.  I've been heading out no dose.  But it just reminds me of the time that I went to see Neil Young, and he did two hours  where not one song was recognizable, because he was off on one of his experimentations.  And, you know, I think people out there can relate to it.  That's why we're bringing it up, because there's these artists that you grew up with,  and you finally get a chance to see them doing, you know, something new, and these people 
[00:23:00]  are just experimenting, and you just want to hear some of the songs that made him famous.  That's all.  You know, because I guess Roger Waters is experimenting with opera now, and, you know, these guys,  they're just getting old, and they want to, like, do, like, completely different things  than what they're known for.  It's like, all right, do that with your friends back in Europe or something, in your castle.  Or in your basement, or playing in your yard while Billy Bob Thornton and John Ritter 
[00:23:30]  just stare at you.  Get the band together.  Right.  You toss your friend in the wheelchair.  Right.  But I think if you invite the public, then I think there's expectations there.  That's all I'm saying.  There is not.  That's just it.  There's not one person in that room that is watching Sting playing that god-awful lute  that isn't thinking, oh, my God, I would just love to hear him do a police song.  This is drivel.  Not one person.  I've never wanted to be Patrice so badly in my life. 
[00:24:00]  Not during the performance.  But afterwards, on the elevator, I wish I would have had the balls.  We're all in the elevator, and then the elevator stops off the lower floor, and Hugh Panera  gets on.  His wife gives a bunch of, you know, and everyone's trying to be polite.  Wow, that was interesting.  And I wish I would have just said, that stunk.  Stunk on ice.  Jane Curtin, or as my friend in high school said, Jane Curtin was there, and I got a picture  with her and annoyed her. 
[00:24:30]  Really?  She's like, what did you think of the concert?  Yeah, she had a debate whether she wanted to take a picture with Jim Norton.  I watched the whole thing go down, and I'm like, no one has asked for your picture in  20 years.  Why the hell would she have a debate over...  She actually stopped and thought about it.  I watched it.  And she's thinking, hmm, yeah, I guess it's okay.  You friggin', oh God, do I hate all of these movies.  What else are you doing?  You can't take a picture.  I hate all of them.  That's so bizarre to me. 
[00:25:00]  You gotta run in and shoot weekend?  Oh, no.  Not since 77.  Yeah, that's right.  Before the Iranian hostages, you were finished.  But she actually, you could see her brain thinking, yeah, should I...  Yeah, I guess.  How old is she?  Oh, she's gotta be 100.  I don't know.  Yeah.  She looked good.  I mean, she was nice to Jimmy and all, but she was a day.  When I thought of the concert and stuff, I was a silly coward.  I should have went, but I went, that was interesting.  That's what I was expecting.  It sucked.  I kept thinking, like, does she know this thing?  Is she friends with him? 
[00:25:30]  Well, he probably, like, you know, played on Saturday Night Live.  Right.  I don't know.  And she went and walked up home.  Was she there still?  And he's like, oh, yeah, did I meet you?  I don't know how long she was there.  I would rather listen to Steve C. play the skin flute than Sting.  Well, we have that coming up.  I just, I'm elusive.  All right.  Well, there you go.  That was our night.  Sorry it bored some people, but...  I can't have bored them.  I sat through an hour, over an hour of boredom. 
[00:26:00]  Actually, we accomplished something then with this first break,  because we made you feel exactly how we felt last night.  Welcome aboard.  There you go.  So, good luck, bro, to Sting and his lute playing.  I'm sure it's going to be a huge success for you.  Although, he doesn't care.  He doesn't care if he sells one CD.  It's what he wants to do.  So, I guess in the end, you've got to respect that.  But, I don't know.  Do we have anything?  Do we have some lute playing?  Yeah, we're going to try to find a lute song.  We'll do it after the break.  You got one right now? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, just play a little taste.  Okay.  This is fantastic.  All I was thinking is what wonderful music this is to get a happy ending to.  It would be.  This is massage music.  This is what you hear when you're getting a massage.  Yeah.  This is wooden teeth music.  This is like...  What is this?  Run my bath, boy.  Yeah.  This is period piece music. 
[00:27:00]  It's a theme from every Malkovich movie.  Oh, my God.  And you had to just sit there.  Dude.  You know what?  I don't have to tell people.  When someone's playing the guitar, you can do a lot of different things with the guitar.  Yeah.  You find out really quickly that there's pretty much one sound to the lute.  And you're listening to it.  This is it.  And this is it.  You can speed it up just a little bit.  I don't want to hear from these classical music fags out there that there's more to 
[00:27:30]  the lute.  No, there's not.  This is what you get in every song.  While you're listening to the lute, you have two choices.  Sleep or kill yourself.  And the guy was a great lute player.  He was a great...  How could he tell?  Just because he was really jamming on the lutes.  There was a bunch of different lutes.  Just a creepy-looking instrument.  Do a totally-do to this.  Wait, Jimmy will be the lead vocalist in this next lute song. 
[00:28:00]  Toot-dee-doo, toot-dee-doo, toot-dee-doo, toot-dee-doo, toot-dee-doo.  Two damage, two damage.  Yeah, exactly.  This is two-damage music.  Casting spells.  Beanbag spells.  All right, enough.  See, we went to an uncomfortable place to see what we could do with it.  There you go.  We were brave enough to talk about the lute this morning.  Someone's saying it is two for Tuesday. 
[00:28:30]  Now you've got to play another lute song.  No, it's all right.  It's all right.  All right, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA, uncut, and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:29:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Look how red he's getting.  We wanted Eric to bring us back with some lute music instead of coming back with the rock music like we usually do.  I usually hit the rock music.  We needed Eric to hit the button over there in the master computer to play the lute song.  Yep.  We're going to do a cute little bit for you.  Oh, well.  And it didn't work.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:29:30]  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's say hi to Eric in Connecticut.  What's up, Eric?  Hey, yeah, Dan.  You guys are being a hypocrite this morning, Bustin' Sting, for not playing what made him famous.  Where the hell is the wiffle ball bat challenge?  Can't do that here, sir.  The wiffle ball bat challenge made us famous?  It was one of the things that got you guys real big in New York years ago.  That's what we called an attention together.  That was the thing that got us big in New York was a wiffle ball bat up a girl's you-know-what? 
[00:30:00]  It was one of the things you guys did all crazy.  Now you guys just sit there and you're lame in the morning, man.  Then don't listen to us, Eric.  What can I tell you?  Then tune out.  Go away.  Hey, stop listening every day.  Why are you listening, dude?  The only reason you know we don't do that is because you've listened every day and we haven't done it.  So go away.  Listen to something else.  If that's what you like, dude, why don't you just get a bat, go in and wake your wife up and do it to her.  Yeah, beat her over the head.  You know that this show has never sounded better, Eric? 
[00:30:30]  Then take the bat and shove it up your ass, Eric.  See, you're one of those guys, you only listen to us for the dumb crap.  You know, you only enjoyed a wiffle ball bat challenge.  That's all you cared about.  Is that what you do?  Is that what you like?  No, actually, I like you guys going off on people.  I just want to get you started.  And we haven't done that?  No, you didn't.  Now you're backpedaling.  You're backpedaling.  And you're not going to pull out of it.  Because we made you look like an ass, so now you're backpedaling.  You're an idiot.  Go away. 
[00:31:00]  God, we have too many listeners.  It's time to thin the herd.  Well, we can thin a few right now.  Thin a few.  Kristen in Vermont.  Hey, how's it going?  What's up?  Hey, not too much, dude.  You bored the hell out of me, man.  And how long did you listen to the boredom?  The whole time.  All right.  What's wrong with you?  When something bores me, guess what?  I leave.  You sit and watch it.  Oh, yeah.  Like I do.  Yeah.  I know.  You sat there and watched it last night.  I started that sentence going, uh, uh. 
[00:31:30]  Something bores me.  I stand up and applaud it.  Well, that's just because we had seats that were kind of weird and we couldn't get up in  front of everybody.  Right, Jimmy?  We could have skidabbled.  We had great seats off to the side.  You should have skidabbled.  If we were in the back row to the side, we could have left and no one would have known.  We were in a little balcony and there's a giant piece of, it's like a giant glass window.  It's gorgeous.  And I wanted to yell, I can't take this and then jump off the balcony.  And instead of jumping through the window, it would have been funny if I just splatted 
[00:32:00]  against it and slid down to the floor.  Smack face first into it.  Well, that stupid lute.  All right, uh, let's say hi to Mike in, uh, I.N.  Would that be Indiana?  Yes.  Of course it would.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, I was just wondering when Mick Jagger was going to do his, uh, three-hour special  on the greatest top ten didgeridooist.  Didgeridoo.  Play the didgeridoo.  All right, well.  Let me interrupt this program.  What? 
[00:32:30]  The ozone digit sighting of the day.  Who saw this coming?  John, what's up?  Hey, guys, great show.  Uh, I've got a great midget sighting.  He's a, uh, he works in a supermarket in Montclair, New Jersey.  And, uh, he's, he's actually the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of midgets.  If you line them up all together, you know, they're kind of basically the same height.  This guy is actually a lot taller, so he has the short, fat arms with the face.  And when he gets up on this, he's got to jump up on that rail to stock the shelves.  It's really funny. 
[00:33:00]  And, uh, but when he, when he, when he can't really reach it, they go,  Hey, friend, hey, friend, I need your help over here.  So it's like, uh, I could just see him after he serves the customers going,  Toot-ly-doo, toot-ly-da.  It's Toot-ly-doo.  It's Toot-ly-doo.  Toot-ly-doo.  People are getting it wrong.  Jimmy, give him a Toot-ly-doo.  Please hold, sir.  All right, listen.  People are enjoying the Toot-ly-doo, or now, Toot-ly-doo.  Yeah, right.  All right, Jimmy, do it right for everybody.  Toot-ly-doo.  See?  You need the accent. 
[00:33:30]  Make sure it's Toot-ly-doo.  Get it right.  All right, we're going to move on to other things now.  People are applauding, yes.  God, everyone is talking about Joe Torre in New York.  Now they're saying Joe's safe.  Yank's set to keep him as manager.  Rudy Giuliani, because, you know, he knows baseball.  On the front page of the Daily News.  Don't let Joe go.  That's just as important as nuclear cloud, by the way. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  These dopey papers.  The New York Post doesn't even throw North Korea on the front page.  It's all about Joe Torre.  The Daily News at least gives it, like, half the space on the front page.  Yeah, it's half the front page.  Is that a nuke was set off?  Right.  That's just...  Because when you look at the front page of something, if you see half the page with  one item and half the other, they've got to be equally as important, right?  Exactly.  So they're pretty much telling us, Rudy Giuliani's saying, don't let Joe go, and the North Korean 
[00:34:30]  situation is just as important.  They're equal.  Equal in our eyes.  Nuclear device was exploded.  Was it?  Does anyone know for sure?  Some people are saying maybe it was a dud.  Oh, really?  And, like, the explosion that was felt on some earthquake-measuring seismic equipment  in Japan might have just been the detonation that is supposed to start the chain reaction 
[00:35:00]  that starts a nuclear explosion instead of the actual nuke going off, because it was very  small for a nuke.  So they're saying that might not even have been a nuke.  But they're trying.  You've got to give it...  They've got a lot of gumption, those North Koreans.  They'll figure it out.  And, yeah, they don't want to talk to everybody else.  They just want to sit with the good old United States of America and have a discussion so 
[00:35:30]  they can get all the sanctions lifted and get money out of us because their nation is impoverished,  because their leader is a nut, and pours all this money into things like a nuclear program.  Right.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, who wants to handle this next one?  Uh, what are we...  The listeners are surly today.  Mike in Philly, what's up?  What's up, bro?  Hi, Mike.  I just want to tell you guys, you do the best thing on free radio, but you just aren't caught  it, man.  You guys just aren't filling Howard's shoes.  Apparently, we're doing very well, sir.  Wait a minute. 
[00:36:00]  We're the best thing on regular radio, but...  Yeah.  Do you have a serious...  Do you know how stupid that sounds?  Do you have a serious radio, sir?  Dude, if you're going to trash us, do it right and just go right at us.  How do you say you're the best thing on regular radio, but you don't fill Howard's shoes?  You don't have...  I like this.  Since Howard left, you guys are...  There's no one that could have filled this spot better than O.B. and Anthony.  Mike, you honestly think Howard at the end of his commercial radio career was that good?  You're lying to yourself. 
[00:36:30]  You're still remembering the old days of Howard, first of all.  Everyone's waxing fantastic.  He's still that good.  Do you got a serious...  Dude, do you got a serious or no?  Wait, wait.  Do you have a serious or no?  Yeah.  Then why are you listening to us now?  I like to flip around.  You're a dude.  Why do you like to flip around if he's so good?  Dope.  Hey, Owen, I'm not saying you guys aren't great.  You guys are...  Stop the passive-aggressive crap.  We don't give a crap about that.  All right.  We know people don't like us, and you're one of those people, but you're going to try 
[00:37:00]  to do it another way.  No.  Go listen to Howard, then, bro.  No.  You got the radio.  He's talking to about 100,000 people right now.  We're talking to a few million.  He needs the help.  Go over there.  He needs the help, sir.  Go over there.  Okay?  All right.  Yeah, stay there.  Turn your radio off.  I want to hear it.  All right.  All right.  Cool.  It's off.  Good.  All right.  Go blow yourself.  Don't listen.  You stupid Philly accent.  Don't listen.  We don't care if you tune in.  We don't need you for the ratings.  Die. 
[00:37:30]  That stupid Philly accent.  Don't ever try to say anything with that stupid Philly accent.  We love you, Philly.  Your accents are terrible.  You know, you guys are in Philly every shoes.  What?  You're the best thing on regular radio, but that is so stupid.  So why are you listening?  I flip around a lot.  Oh, yeah.  Flip around.  Me, Mario.  Back at the show.  Yeah.  I forgot to play that before.  Sorry.  That's all right.  He's so scary good, and you got the satellite. 
[00:38:00]  Then why is he here?  I don't know.  Why?  Really fast.  This morning, I'm watching TV, and they have some kind of sports call-in show on one of  these local channels, and they're talking about Joe Torre, and a phone call comes in  to the sports guy on TV, and the guy goes, you know, it all started going downhill when  they traded Andy Pettit.  And I'm looking at my TV like, what?  Does this dope realize that the Yankees were the best team in baseball this year alongside 
[00:38:30]  the Mets?  And as far as the Tigers being the Yankees, which was so exciting for Detroit, we all  understand that, and the celebration was amazing.  We went over that yesterday.  Do you realize that Detroit was the best team in baseball for most of the year?  And then at the end, they kind of fell off a little bit, but I think they ended up being  the third best team in baseball at the end of the season.  So this guy is saying it all went downhill when the Yankees traded Andy Pettit.  How?  What? 
[00:39:00]  They were the best team in baseball.  Maybe.  And in a five-game series against a team that was the third best team in baseball, anything  could happen.  Could go either way.  And when you have the pitching staff that the Yankees have, or had, it's not Joe Torre's  fault.  They're trying to blame Joe Torre.  Well, I don't think he wanted to trade Pettit, did he?  Who cares?  Is that the reason, really, that that was the moment where the Yankees started going  quote, downhill?  They won over 100 games this year.  How's that going downhill?  Someone's head's got to roll, is what it is. 
[00:39:30]  They can't win playoff games anymore, because all they do is build up a giant lineup, which  never wins World Series.  Pettit was a bad trade.  I don't know why they let him go.  He was a great stopper.  He would come in and win.  He did nothing, but he was a great Yankee, and they were disloyal to him.  Yeah, heads should roll.  The players' heads, instead of using the manager or the general manager as a scapegoat, their  head should roll.  They should put business as usual.  They should put the pressure on A-Rod to the point where he wants to be traded. 
[00:40:00]  That's what they should do.  He stinks under pressure.  It's just what happens, though.  That's how they do it.  But these sports talk shows, and it drives me nuts, but I listen and watch when I can,  because it's so ridiculous.  How do you say that?  It all started going downhill when they traded Andy Pettit.  What does that mean?  Did you see the year the Yankees had?  And I'm defending them.  I'm a Mets fan, but this sports talk crap drives me nuts.  Yeah.  The stuff they come up with, and then they'll discuss it for an hour. 
[00:40:30]  They'll discuss the ins and outs of the Andy Pettit trade and what it meant to the team.  So, even though it really doesn't matter at this point, it's ancient history.  It's done.  It's all about the Mets now in New York.  That's it.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dave.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, you calling me?  Yeah.  Yeah, what's up, Dave?  And I just want to call you out on your Long Island roots. 
[00:41:00]  How many R's are there in Korea?  Yeah, I didn't sleep well last night, and you're right.  I think I said career.  Right?  I added the R at the end like they do with the Long Island accent.  I know it's Korea, sir.  Career.  Career.  Huh?  It's career.  You made my morning.  Career.  What?  The country?  Oh, I thought you were talking about somebody's career.  No, instead of saying Korea. 
[00:41:30]  Career.  I was, you know, a little bit excited this morning.  I had no idea what this guy meant.  So I said career.  Yeah, I know I said that.  Instead of Korea.  I know it's Korea.  All right, let's say hi to Bill in Michigan.  In New York, you might say Korea.  Hey, that guy's got a good Korea.  Bill, what's up?  Oh, Bill.  Hey, Anthony.  He exports to Korea.  Thank you, God, for actually giving the Tigers some credit.  Sitting here in Michigan for the past couple weeks while your Yankees played my Tigers, 
[00:42:00]  no one gave us a chance.  Everybody pretty much said we were going to get our ass kicked.  Not me.  Well, I know, Jim, but I tell you what, as somebody who has been watching this for the  past 20 years, especially when they lost 119 games three years ago, it's awesome that  we did this, and it's actually given us some pride here in Michigan.  Sounds like sports radio, doesn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  A bunch of men swinging a stick at a ball.  By the way, someone's correcting me. 
[00:42:30]  Yes, I know Pettit left as a free agent, but that's what was said on TV this morning  when Pettit was traded.  Yeah.  I was quoting what I heard.  And they still could have got him back, and they didn't.  So thanks, Bill.  You're excited up there in Michigan, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good luck to you.  Sounds it.  They're all excited up there.  Thank you so much for giving my Tigers the credit.  Jordan, what's up?  Yellow.  Jordan.  How are you doing?  What's up? 
[00:43:00]  Huge fan of you guys.  Live in Tucson, Arizona now, but I grew up in Michigan my whole life, and I wanted to  say, I listened to you guys in the replay.  Thanks again for giving the Tigers the credit.  Everyone's excited.  It does great things for the city of Detroit, like when we had the Super Bowl, the All-Star  game, they moved the homeless out to the suburbs, and they clean up the city.  It looks beautiful.  Everyone gets excited.  And I don't know if you guys have seen any pictures of Bonnerman, the pitcher who pitched  the shutout the other day, but he bears a striking resemblance to Jimmy. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  A lot of people are saying that.  Yeah.  Very nice.  He looks like a handsome fellow.  A little Jimmy.  Hey, when we get something going on in Detroit, we're going to come up there and see you guys.  Any chance you guys are doing anything out here on the West Coast?  No, never.  Oh, that's right.  You're not in Detroit anymore.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, eventually.  We're taking notice of all the cities we're being broadcast in, and Pittsburgh is on our  radar now.  You know, Philly's always been on our radar.  Boston has always been on our radar. 
[00:44:00]  Buffalo is starting to get on our radar.  Yeah.  Dominatrix.  But who's on the radar?  Dallas is on our radar.  There's a dominatrix I want to see, actually, around Tucson, so I would go out there.  What does she do?  A lot of good things.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  She treats you like porcelain.  Oh, my God.  She's a good girl.  Because I know you.  You're not into that normal dominatrix thing, which is the pain, the bondage.  That stuff's silly.  It's ridiculous.  I find it silly.  We used to get, we used to get, like, dominatrix in, and they would do things, and then they'd 
[00:44:30]  try to come over and go, okay, give me your hands, and I'd go, no, no.  Well, I'm going to tie you up, well, I'm going to tie you up, and I've got a crop here, and  we'll do you.  What are you going to do?  You're going to smack my hiney?  It's the worst, the dominatrix.  Here, put these cuffs on.  They're like plastic, fluffy cuffs with little pink fuzzies on them.  One of my favorite moments ever, and I think we got drunk, and we were at some, I don't 
[00:45:00]  know, meeting with Super Agent Bob Eatman or something back in the day.  I don't remember, but we had business.  We had business in New York after hours, and we stumbled back to WNEW and went on Ron and  Fez's show, and they were in the middle of this massive, like, dominatrix segment where  everything Ann's describing what she was doing to this guy.  Just all that horrible stuff where it's like, kneel for me, I'm your master, kneel for 
[00:45:30]  me, slave, yes, yes, my master, and the guy would kneel, and I'm just looking mistress,  whatever the hell they call him.  How about seabag?  Because that's what I would call her.  And I hate that whole, I'm dominant over you thing that these doms put on, because it  is a put on.  It's this whole fantasy thing, and the guy, as long as he's...  willing to kneel down and be handcuffed, that's the only way it's going down. 
[00:46:00]  If the guy doesn't want it, this bitch ain't got a chance in hell of cuffing me, or actually  dominating me.  It's a perception of domination.  Absolutely.  So I made the...  And I'll be proof to that point.  I made the dominatrix cry and run out of the studio with her handcuffs, her whip.  Nothing better than that tough girl.  Her latex, her whips, her chains, her...  Running out of the studio in tears.  Oh, did I enjoy that. 
[00:46:30]  Her fuzzy handcuffs.  Her fuzzy handcuffs.  Her attitude.  Her weapons of destruction.  Her and her weapons running out of the studio crying.  And what were your magic words?  She couldn't get to the elevator fast enough.  Oh, I noticed she had a striking resemblance to Mr. Ramon there.  Joey Ramon.  Joey Ramon.  That's all it took.  That's all it took.  All right, Joey Ramon.  Because she was trying to engage us, and like I said, no, it's never going to happen. 
[00:47:00]  Give me your hands.  You're going to love this.  No.  No.  You put your hands behind your back.  I'm going to tie your hands up, and then take your shirt off.  Right.  Take your shirt off.  Yeah, they try to get all tough, and I just looked and went, no.  There is not a way in hell you're getting me to take my shirt off and tie my hands behind  my back.  Yeah.  I'll tell you, there's a couple of them that are really good at what they do, though.  If it's like a really organic behavior for them just to be that way...  I'd sooner punch her in her face. 
[00:47:30]  But a lot of guys enjoy that, though.  If a woman knows to dominate you and spank you, there's a woman, a mistress, whatever  her name, I might say her name, but she's in Tucson, Arizona, and she has a really weird  accent, but you can tell that she is a pervert, and she likes what she's doing.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's really sexy, man.  There are guys, though, that I guess are into that and would be...  It's only because they're into it.  Like, there ought to be a dom that if you're into it, you write her or call her or whatever 
[00:48:00]  it is, and at some random time she comes over and pretty much just rapes you.  Like, that's it.  She's so powerful that that happens.  And if you're into it, enjoy.  God bless.  But all this phony dom crap where they come around and all their stuff is breakaway and  all this.  What is that?  Just stop with your little crop.  That was another thing.  She's taking the crop and tap, tap, tap, tap, tap on this guy's ass that was in the studio. 
[00:48:30]  And every once in a while she would give him a hard one and everyone would go, ooh!  Ooh!  It's like a pummel.  All I want to see is some dummy get his hands tied behind his back with a big dopey smile  on his face, get his legs bound like he's going to have a lot of fun.  This is going to be fun.  Look, okay, my shirt's up.  Oh, look, it's like a bachelor party.  Yeah, it's like the bachelor party.  I saw my friend do this.  It was great.  And watch this woman bring him to the brink of death. 
[00:49:00]  Just, like, slice him with knives and punch him in the face.  And then he starts yelling, fuzzy, fuzzy.  Yeah, the code word.  That's their safe word.  Your safe word is fuzzy.  Fuzzy, fuzzy.  I'll show you fuzzy.  Wham!  Wham!  Like a cinder block into his head.  Right.  Oh, would I be laughing.  You bought into the safe word, you dope.  You bought into the whole act.  This is a dom.  She is dominating you.  So I go, you look like Joey Ramone in a wig.  And she picked up her weapons of destruction and ran out crying. 
[00:49:30]  She tried to continue a little, but we noticed, like, her face turned red and her eyes started  welling up.  And then Ovi goes, are you crying?  And she just picked her crap up and ran out the door.  And it was hysterical.  Because that's what you do when someone's crying in front of you.  You point at them.  You got to point it out.  Acknowledge that they're crying.  You don't look down at the floor and make believe you're not looking at someone crying.  Oh, it was hysterical.  We got to get the audio. 
[00:50:00]  I think it's out there so much.  All right.  I can give out this woman's name, right?  Because she has a website.  Can we use that as a tease, Jimmy?  Because look at the time.  They're killing us.  All right?  We'll come back.  She's in Arizona.  We'll talk about the dominatrix in Arizona when we get back.  Okay?  I love her.  And the guy who's saying that we're ripping off dice now, please stay on the line.  We'll talk to you next.  Ryan and George will give you some time on the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, it's the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:50:30]  This reminds me of when me and O first hooked up.  It's one of the many songs we used to have to play for an hour.  I used to like playing the butt trumpets.  You're ugly.  You're ugly.  Yeah.  The old days.  What's up, Worcester? 
[00:51:00]  Alternative and grunge.  The only station that really rocks.  Everybody else plays loot music.  All loot.  All day.  It's a loot weekend.  Radio station slogans stink.  There's nothing new there.  I don't know how you change it.  No one's come up with something new.  Well, there's something new.  It's just giving it some guy's name.  It seems to be the new thing.  I worked for three homes of rock and roll. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Can't there only be one home of rock and roll?  No.  The family's gotten that big.  They've had to move on to other homes.  It's a lot of homes all over America.  Because I did Long Island's home of rock and roll.  I did Rochester's home of rock and roll.  And I did Buffalo's home of rock and roll.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I worked for a station that, well, Ant and I did, that their slogan was, the only  station that really rocks.  And I would sit there like, but BCN is playing the same music we're playing. 
[00:52:00]  So why do we rock but they don't?  Other stations are rocking.  How could they claim that?  Because I heard another station, and I would consider it have been rocking.  Right.  What are some of the other slogans I don't even remember anymore?  I heard one rock station that says, we rock, as well do some others.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  Didn't last long, but.  Our old station, Anthony, their new slogan is, everything that rocks. 
[00:52:30]  Everything.  Everything that rocks.  Wow.  Hey, man.  That leaves everyone else out.  Give me some time.  I'll find a lute song that rocks.  There's got to be one.  Are you playing that?  Good luck to you.  If you're not, you're a liar.  Classic rock that really rocks is another one, I believe.  Yeah.  And then, of course, I'm sure we're on a bunch of stations that are named after a cute animal.  Fox is a big one.  Well, we're on the wolf.  That's kind of a cool animal, I guess. 
[00:53:00]  The wolf.  How about the gerbil?  Ooh.  Smothered in a dark corridor.  Only play show tunes.  How about?  And Streisand.  How about?  You're listening to the Puggle.  The Puggle.  The Puggle.  Classic rock that really rocks.  Only on the Puggle.  Cute as a button, those Puggles.  Sure are.  What a great place for a boot.  Hey, Ryan in Jersey, what's up? 
[00:53:30]  Hey, O&A, what's up, boys?  Hi, Ryan.  How are you?  Hello, little Jimmy.  Hi.  The reason I was calling is you guys probably have all seen when Dice was relevant.  He put out those few, maybe two, three, or four live tapings, Dice rules, whatever.  There's one, the Dice Man Cometh, that in the beginning, he does a little skit where he's  working at a big and tall store and a big, fat couple comes in and pretty much the same 
[00:54:00]  lines as we're using your commercial.  And I'm a big fan.  I just wasn't sure if you guys were aware of that.  You think we ripped off Andrew Dice Clay for our commercial?  Well, they're very similar.  Your bit.  And unfortunately, great minds think alike.  What can I tell you?  We didn't rip off Andrew Dice Clay. 
[00:54:30]  First of all, we didn't write it.  And secondly, I guess our writers decided to rip off a 20-year-old has-been from 20 years  ago and use that as a commercial.  Is that what you're implying, sir?  Listeners, surly today.  You guys weren't aware of it, so maybe somebody who was aware of it be held accountable.  What album is it on?  We'll even play it. 
[00:55:00]  All right.  The Dice Man cometh.  Kenny, did we rip off Andrew Dice Clay?  Kenny would know he's the authority.  It's from his first HBO special.  Yeah.  You know, he did a little thing like a prelude, like a day in the life type of thing.  You know, like the backstory about, you know, Dice's life.  And, you know, he used to sell men's clothes at one of his jobs before, you know, he was  a comic.  Yeah.  And he does a little skit where, you know, two fat people come into the store and they're 
[00:55:30]  trying to pick a suit and, you know, he can't take it no more because they tried on like  50 suits and he still looks fat.  Right.  And they're like, how's this one?  He's like, you're fat.  You'll always be fat.  You know, you're just fat.  And that's the whole skit.  And then like, he has a few words with his girlfriend and he tells his mommy he's going  to Hollywood to make it.  And next thing you know, they cut to the standup special.  So, did we rip them off? 
[00:56:00]  I mean, there's only so many premises in this world.  You know, it's just, you know, it's a lot of people make fun of fat people.  And I don't care for it.  I don't think it should be done anymore.  Yeah.  I don't think the fat people should be.  By the way, what the hell is going on with the listeners today?  Did they hand out Valium or something?  Evan, everyone's phone call is like this.  Hey, Ope, there's one thing I want to say before I left.  Uh-oh.  Boop-a-boo. 
[00:56:30]  Oh.  He's going back a few years with you.  What was that noise you made when you hung up?  What was it?  Look at how he tries to put a serious face on when he's ready to just strike.  No, that was actually a reference to that.  I thought that the other day.  I didn't.  I forgot to answer.  I really don't know.  I don't remember.  When you used to hang up, what was it?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't really know.  Look at how Jimmy gets.  I think I...  You were acting.  I think I used to go...  You're like, who was that, Jim?  I think I used to go, see ya, sir, and then shoot. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, something like that.  And then maybe it turned into something else.  I don't really remember, Jimmy.  Does anybody remember?  I don't remember.  No, no one remembers.  No, no one remembers.  Please.  No one was listening to me back then.  I think it was like a COP nighttime attitude signing off.  Obese primate.  There you go.  Hey, Boston, what's up?  Chunky monkey.  But with rich people.  Boston, what's going on?  Yeah, I was up in Wisconsin a couple years ago, and there was a station, the D Cup of rock 
[00:57:30]  and roll stations.  It was called the D Cup of rock and roll stations?  Yeah, yeah.  What did that mean?  They were big tips of rock and roll.  I don't know.  Hmm.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, we got to talk about this dominatrix out west air.  In where?  I think she's in Arizona somewhere.  Arizona, okay.  I don't know if it's Tucson or Phoenix.  I really don't know where she is in Arizona.  I've never met her.  I've only seen her online and done tremendous damage to myself looking at her video clips. 
[00:58:00]  Online?  She's got a website, yeah.  Yeah.  I can't get the website out, but I'll just say her name.  She's a public figure.  It's Karen Von Croft.  Oh, well, that sounds very...  Oh, she's a naughty one.  Very sexy.  I love her.  To me, she seems like, at least from her movies, like she's...  And she paddles, like you said, little one, but that's the way to do it.  That's the way to do it.  No, it's not.  No, it is.  Because you can't just bludgeon somebody.  I won't have any of it, but I'm thinking if somebody is into it, they should be beaten 
[00:58:30]  within an inch of their life by these broads.  You're so right, Ed.  She doesn't do...  I don't like...  It's phony.  I don't like living in the fantasy world.  Yeah, it's a fantasy phony thing.  Right.  And they should just be beaten where they are found on the floor, and if they didn't get  to the hospital that minute, they would die.  That's a true dominator.  That's a dom.  Not the fuzzy handcuffs like they're Velcroed on. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Scary stuff here.  Oh, I'm trapped.  I'm trapped.  Creak.  I'm out.  What kind of crap is that?  This girl, I just...  Jimmy's getting frustrated.  We just don't live in that world.  No, I'm not into that either.  Dude, not at all.  Not at all.  We've seen Jimmy.  No, I'm not...  Not into the spanking.  No, no, no.  No, but when I say not live in the world, like you understand on some level, I don't understand.  Yeah.  I just don't.  I don't get it.  I don't get that.  There are guys that like that hardcore.  I mean, I've met one hardcore Don in my life that was for... 
[00:59:30]  She wouldn't take safe words or any of that stuff.  She was for real.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was like in boxing and stuff.  She would really hurt.  See?  There you go.  That's the real deal.  If you're into that, go to her.  If she's for real, then she would have a murder rap somewhere.  Yeah, something.  That's for real.  One of her dumb clients gone awry.  Right.  Where she just left them dead.  Yeah.  Had to wipe down the doorknob when she was leaving.  The strap-on power drill went awry.  You know, something.  Something happened.  Like it was a mistake.  So she only did...  Oh, God. 
[01:00:00]  Stop.  Oh, God.  No, you're naughty.  Remember?  It was a mistake.  So she only did five to seven.  You know what I mean?  So she's out there and it's on her resume.  What's your safe word?  I don't remember.  I've lost too much blood.  Oh, my God.  Stop.  You're killing me.  I thought this would be just fun.  I turned 40 and I just wanted to try to look at you.  Oh, God.  I got a wife and three kids at home. 
[01:00:30]  The nude body of a father was found today in a seedy hotel room.  Was?  I made a mistake because my safe word was, I dare you to do it harder, bitch.  It was a safe phrase.  It was a safe word.  Oh, it's just the worst.  It really is.  Fantasy play taken to the umpteenth extent is ridiculous.  And I mean that with dominatrix, your significant other, or wife, or anything like that. 
[01:01:00]  There's fun stuff you do in bed while you're having sex.  You know, like we brought up in the past, the hair pulling's fun, a little smack on the ass,  a little good-natured slap on the ass, things like that, biting, things like that.  It's fun and good-natured.  But if you're following a script, Mr. Faber-Sham, I'm going to have sex with you.  Sex with you.  You know, like it's too deep, like, all right, I come home from work. 
[01:01:30]  If it entails, like, blocking your house off and a director and, like, I come home from work,  you're waiting in the maid's uniform.  Right.  Stop it.  I'm going to come through the window.  Yeah.  And you're going to blow my head off because you forgot it was Tuesday.  Right.  You know?  It was, right, fantasy day.  Fantasy day.  I thought it was Wednesday.  It was Tuesday.  And I shot him.  Now I can't even chew my food anymore. 
[01:02:00]  It's just a business trip to Des Moines.  He was supposed to come home on Wednesday.  It was Tuesday because we had this rape fantasy.  And he came through the window and I shot him.  He shot me.  I shot me.  I have no jaw left.  You want to do for a rape fantasy?  Like, have a girl, like, there are girls that want you to do that.  Like, you tie them up and, like, you know, just blindfold her.  I want to have that with a girl where she's having to blindfold you and tie you up.  And then while it's happening, call her cell phone and go, it's not me doing it. 
[01:02:30]  Send somebody else.  Hey.  Call them and go, I'm sorry, baby.  I'm not going to be able to get home for about another hour or so.  I sent my black co-worker to pick up a couple of things.  What the hell is that?  Uh-oh.  Oh, okay.  I don't like that role play.  That's where I recognize it.  Role play is just, like, you know, I'm the mailman. 
[01:03:00]  No, you're not.  Yeah.  No, you're not.  Same girl.  You're not.  I'm the naughty nurse.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  With this stupid rubber suit, like it's 1941 with the red X on their hat.  Right.  What year is this?  Look.  What, are you going to put leeches on me?  How old is that nurse costume?  Look, I'll admit you look hot as, like, whatever.  I can't say the word.  You look hot, but you're not a nurse, okay?  You're not the naughty nurse.  And the naughty nurse thing is a sicko fantasy for a guy.  It has to do with, what do they use? 
[01:03:30]  Enemas?  Yeah.  The enema, things like that.  Things that are, like, I'm sickly, I need to be in your care kind of a thing.  It's a motherly thing almost.  It can be, or it could also be a candy striper type thing where they're just hot chicks in,  like, little short skirts.  Well, that's totally, that is completely different.  If there's a girl in a rubber nurse suit with that big red cross on her hat, get away 
[01:04:00]  from me.  That's ridiculous.  But a candy striper thing?  That's kind of cool.  You know, that's cool.  But as long as it doesn't go into this extravagant, scripted role playing.  Oh, I hate that.  You have been a bad boy.  Yes, I have.  I sure have, naughty nurse.  Oh, no.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do? 
[01:04:30]  You know, sometimes when I'm kissing, I have to fight the urge to grab the throat.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Just choke a bitch.  I don't want to hurt her, but I like to choke a lot, man.  I have to fight the urge.  Like, if I'm kissing a girl, all of a sudden she'll feel my hands in a necklace pose around.  Tapping her chest.  Tapping.  I really want to choke you.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with you?  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy.  I love this.  Anthony and Yonkers, what's up?  Yeah.  Anthony doesn't like living in the fantasy world.  Too damaged.  Too damaged. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I keep my fantasies to the computer monitor.  Yeah, LARPing a lot cooler than Dominator thing.  Is that a train?  Look, I didn't say, like, fantasy or some type of, not role playing, but just things you don't do in normal life in the bedroom is fine.  And like I said, you know, a little playful stuff.  I like playful stuff.  But also, you know, like a little bit of hair pulling is cool, things like that. 
[01:05:30]  The little smack.  But in, like, playful, funny kind of ways.  The real rough stuff or the scripted, like I said, the guy's in the garage and it's already begun.  And action.  All right.  I'm pulling into the garage.  What's going to meet me at the door?  Oh, it's the naughty maid.  Right.  Oh, is it?  She's got her feather duster.  There you go.  Naughty maid.  Hey, big boy. 
[01:06:00]  In the naughty maid outfit.  Oh, who hasn't seen that?  You want me to clean?  And then she winks?  No.  Stop it.  I'm a fan of the oopsies.  Oopsies?  What is the oopsies?  You know, you're...  They bend over and there's an oopsie.  Like, oops.  You weren't supposed to see that.  Oh, oh, oh, yeah.  And do they turn around and take their hand and slightly cover their mouth and go, oopsie. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, you weren't supposed to see that.  They turn around and look over their shoulder with their hand to their mouth.  Oopsie.  You're not taking a peek, are you?  You bad boy.  Oopsie.  I had a nurse...  I'm a businessman with three kids.  I had the same word was supposed to be.  Fuzzy.  She's dead.  I see this girl in Vegas and she would do a nurse and her nurse's name was Nurse Pig. 
[01:07:00]  Nurse Pig.  Nurse Pig.  See, that's not sexy.  Oh, dude.  I could never get past the name Nurse Pig.  She ruled.  She'd come out of the bathroom in like a dirty nurse outfit, but she was full service.  And she's what you call a completely good egg.  Really?  Yeah, and we would do all kinds of things and she would spit in my mouth.  She was a really good nurse.  And I'm not a submissive pig.  She was such a pervert.  I loved her.  She tried to hit me with the strap on. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  I didn't let her, though.  I just let it go for a second and stopped.  I couldn't do it.  Wait, wait.  You let her go for a second, though?  No, no.  Let's just say this.  All right.  It was just knocking at the door?  No, not even.  Let's just say...  Hello?  Who's that knocking at the door?  Yeah, but I wasn't going...  The door was never going to be open.  Who's that ringing the bell?  Yeah.  It was more just kind of cool to see someone being such a pervert knocking at the door.  I just kind of love the deviance of the whole thing.  But as far as the door being open, never going to happen.  No.  No, not for any bad reasons other than I just...  It's not my thing. 
[01:08:00]  You didn't let him in, huh?  I didn't want to let her in.  It was just...  I corrected your hymn.  It was a her.  Well, you know...  That sensation does nothing for me.  Oh.  All right.  Let's get a fist attached to it.  Look at Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Take a bite of that one.  What's up?  What's up, Joe?  I hate that role-playing crap, man.  My girlfriend was trying to get me into role-playing the other night when I was trying to sleep,  so I told her she should play a paralyzed mime.  Just lay there and shut up.  Why would you try to get you into role-play while you were sleeping? 
[01:08:30]  Five minutes later, I was back asleep.  Lovely.  All right.  Good.  Sounds like a thrill-a-minute, doesn't it?  We'll play board radio hosts, and you'll play a guy with an awful joke.  Go.  Oh, this is going well.  I'm just a businessman, baby.  Eric in Colorado.  I didn't know.  Yeah.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, how's Dylan?  How's it going?  Hey, I got to nominate Anthony for line of the day.  Yeah?  Whirly.  Well, earlier when you were talking about staying in the end, he brought up Paul McCartney conducting an orchestra, 
[01:09:00]  and he said that Paul McCartney is going to be using a wooden stick based on his wife's leg.  Ah, well, no, I wouldn't.  I'm declining the nomination.  I thought that was kind of hurtful.  It was hurtful.  It was mean, spirited.  That's not what this show is about.  It's about making people feel good and laugh.  It's about fun and laughter.  Let's go to MJ from Long Island before we take a break.  MJ.  Yo, ONA, what's going on?  Hey.  I used to do security work for a domination out here, and she used to tell me what this guy wanted. 
[01:09:30]  He wanted her to strap it on at least 10 plus, give it to a war like a really bad episode of Oz.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I mean, she used to tell me about it.  I mean, I was like, did the guy want anything?  She's like, no, not even AstroGloid.  I'm sitting there hocking up a loogie worse than Jimmy after seeing something real gross.  It was disgusting.  Would she make you carry and clean the equipment? 
[01:10:00]  Thank God, no, but it had to go with my vehicle.  Oh, my God.  That's...  You guys rule.  Little Jimmy, you suck.  Don't ever change.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  There you go.  Hey, someone from their cell phone.  The worst is when you're done and the uncomfortable silence as you put away the lube, cups, plastic  blindfold.  Oh, it's the most awkward.  You throw everything in the dishwasher.  With the kids' sippy cups.  Sippy cups.  Oh, that big rubber mouth with the extension on it and the little electric light turner 
[01:10:30]  on or off or that goes on it.  It's sitting in the dishwasher next to your champagne flute.  Right next to the Scooby-Doo sippy cup.  Yeah, because we're going to do a separate load for the sex toys, right?  Right, gals?  That's better.  Throw it all in the dishwasher and get the kids ready for school.  That's the most embarrassing thing, though.  It's like the cleanup time. 
[01:11:00]  Always has been.  Yeah.  Just because it's all fine and dandy until everything's laying around the room and the  bedroom and then you're like, oh, it's cleanup time.  Try making small talk when you're folding plastic bags and gargling with peroxide.  It's small talk.  Let's go to break.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over. 
[01:11:30]  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit.  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas or you can just show up during the  walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's go right back to the phones. 
[01:12:00]  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We got Sam in Pittsburgh listening to us on K-Rock.  What's up, Sam?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Ah, we're rocking.  You're not.  Hey, Jimmy.  When you were in Pittsburgh, you killed us.  Well, thank you, buddy.  You enjoyed it?  What'd he say?  What'd he say?  He was giving you a compliment.  Thank you.  Enjoy it.  What'd he say? 
[01:12:30]  I thought I heard Pittsburgh.  Yeah, you...  I heard something about it.  You killed him.  I thought he said, okay.  In Pittsburgh.  I did think you said that.  Thanks, bud.  All right.  Hey, I got a story for you guys.  Oh, my God.  Yes, Sam.  So, one time, me and my girlfriend, right, we're doing the role-playing thing, and I'm  the patient.  She's the nurse, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Please tell me it was a cancer scenario.  I'm sorry.  You do a really unsexy role-play. 
[01:13:00]  Like, you know, my white blood still counters down, and you have to vomit after chemo, and  she helps you, and then punches your face and takes your wallet, and that's your scenario.  She dresses in a hot, naughty nurse outfit and pulls your hair out.  She pulls your wispy hair out.  Go ahead, man.  I'm sorry.  First hour of the fantasy is filling out insurance forms.  I can't go back to my wife and kids looking like this.  Why'd you pull all my hair out? 
[01:13:30]  Drink it.  Drink it.  That dopey businessman.  Karen Mundroft.  I love her.  I said the same word.  She wouldn't stop.  Officer, she wouldn't stop.  She just kept going.  He's naked, shaking with a blanket over him at the police station.  Big clumps of his hair missing, bloody nose.  His wife's calling like crazy.  He's making believe he's at, like, TGIF.  I got mugged.  I got mugged. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, God.  I'm so sorry.  Oh, you're going to go home with two black eyes.  What did I tell my kids?  You should have thought of that before, sir.  Like every pet movie.  Yes, sir.  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead, sir.  Role playing.  This makes me laugh.  So she asked me to pick a name because she wants me to pick a name that's not mine.  So I picked this name that's, like, an inside joke to me and my friend, and I'm like, Mr. McDougal. 
[01:14:30]  Like, I just pick it out of nowhere.  McDougal.  So she called me.  She told me to pick this name.  I can't concentrate because this name is just killing me.  And then she puts on a glove, and I'm like, you know, what is she doing with this glove?  She's like, so do you want me to inspect, you know, basically, do you want to meet an anally  and inspect?  Oh, see, you were doing so good.  Oh, my God.  See, you know what, let me tell you something, Sam.  You were there.  You knew that.  I could tell by your hesitation.  You knew where you wanted to go, but you knew you weren't supposed to go there. 
[01:15:00]  See, all you got to say is, to future callers to this radio show, you don't have to be Captain Obvious.  Here it is.  Here's how you should have said that.  So she puts on the glove.  Now, everyone knows what's coming.  So you go, she puts on the glove because she's going to do the full examination.  There you go.  So everyone knows what you're talking about.  Eyes, ears, nose, and throat.  Right.  And if they don't know what you're talking about, at that point, we don't need them listening 
[01:15:30]  anyway.  They're much too stupid even for this program.  You got enough people aboard, as they say.  Yeah, you don't have to get so graphic.  Don't be Captain Obvious.  We got some very smart, intelligent people that listen to this show.  They can figure crap out.  After nine, you can be Admiral Obvious.  We don't care.  Yeah, really.  But don't be Captain Obvious.  General Obvious.  All right.  After nine, we'll ask you how many fingers.  Well, regardless, say, after that, it's off.  XM, SLA Radio. 
[01:16:00]  What?  All right, go ahead, Sam.  He was able to say what?  He gave up.  Sir.  I'm sorry.  He gave up.  Why did he give up?  Chief in Jersey.  People have a hard time telling these stories.  Yeah.  Chief.  Yeah.  Hey, that's Chief.  It's an old in the game called Put the Ball in the Hole.  Go ahead.  How about that, man?  You guys rocking.  Little Jimmy Norton.  You rule.  Thank you, buddy.  But, no, I was listening before. 
[01:16:30]  I drive to work every day like an hour.  And when you guys were talking about role playing and Andy came up with just choke a bitch,  I damn near caught the 10-car pilot.  That's funny as hell.  That's what Jimmy does.  I just got one more thing to ask Jimmy, though.  Yeah.  I just want to know if he wants to get a black prostitute and Asian prostitute with a little two-on-two  and then grab some Sonny D if he's interested.  We could all poke our infected heads into the fridge.  Sonny Delight for my multicultural friends.  I got a black friend, a girl, and an Asian friend. 
[01:17:00]  And we're all having some Sonny D, Ma.  That's awesome, man.  You guys rock.  Check it out.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, look, son.  Your friends are over.  Get your black hands off the Sonny D.  Mom will pour that for you.  Yes.  Tell your black friend to wait on the porch.  He'll have his Sonny D handed to him through the window.  Look, we're open-minded, but we're not that open-minded.  That's Sonny D.  You wait outside for your fresh, cold glass of Sonny D.  I hated the fact that you were on the inside of the fridge. 
[01:17:30]  You're sitting there next to a pot roast while liberal son and his multicultural friends open the door for some Sonny D after working up some boy sweats.  Boy sweats.  Let's get some Sonny D.  All right.  Yuck.  I also hated the children that wanted more Ovaltine, Mom.  Oh, please.  Who asked for it by brand name?  Yeah.  More homogenized D, Mom.  Yeah, wouldn't you just say, more chocolate milk, Mom. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, or more of that stuff.  More of that stuff.  More awful chocolate milk.  Yeah.  More awful teen.  More gritty drivel, Ma.  Let's go to Miles in Maine.  Yes, Miles.  I was on the internet the other day, and I heard something about a yiffy, furry fandom.  Something involving, like, sex with, like, plushies or something like that.  Oh, plushies are people that like to have sex with people that dress up like stuffed animals. 
[01:18:30]  It's not even people that dress up like stuffed animals.  It's actual stuffed animals.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So it's both?  It's something to do with, yeah.  They'll take the stuffed animal and treat it like, you know, a partner.  Is that a group fantasy, though?  No.  Is that their partner?  It must be for people who are really desperate or something.  Yeah, what the hell?  I don't know where that comes from.  If there's ever been a group of people that should be executed, it's them.  The plushies?  They're awful.  There's websites.  Yeah.  Throw plushies into the Google.  And there's all kinds of techniques that they give on these websites on how to use each stuffed animal and its features. 
[01:19:00]  And, you know, they take, like, if one has little arms, like you got a little doggie, and it's got little arms and legs and stuff.  Well, they're all legs, aren't they, on a dog?  Yeah.  It'd be silly.  Exactly.  If you stood up, you could call them arms, but they never stand up like that.  No, they're always...  They do occasionally, but they can't grab things.  Get me a beer.  No.  It doesn't work.  They can't, but you put peanut butter in the right place, and you'll see exactly why he's Matt's best friend. 
[01:19:30]  Good news, guys.  I got Sting's latest song.  And the good news?  We started this show talking about how we saw Sting last night.  Mm-hmm.  Stink.  As he was playing the lute and the songs of John Dowland, a lutenist that lived in the late 1500s.  This is why the police aren't getting back together anytime soon.  Because Sting has to play the lute. 
[01:20:00]  Sting's lost his mind.  We're waiting for Sting to stop experimenting, and eventually he'll get back on that stage and sing for his supper.  Do the reunion concert already and shut up with your lute.  Well, here's a commercial for his latest album.  But you get to hear the new sound of Sting.  Oh, joy.  And you get to hear the lute.  Come again, sweet love, just love and fight.  Oh, God.  My graces that refrain to do which you delight to see, to sing, to touch, to kiss, to darling. 
[01:20:30]  Songs of Romance and Beauty from Elizabethan composer John Dowland.  See, I'll be honest.  That one, I don't mind.  How do you not mind that?  Because it's asking me.  How?  How?  How?  How?  Shut up.  I don't mind that one.  I don't mind that one.  You don't mind the part where he goes, to die.  To die. 
[01:21:00]  To die.  No, there was other ones.  I would actually give that CD a listen.  I don't know.  Maybe it just annoyed me on principle.  But by the way, I know a Dom who did guys plushies, and she said there was one guy that loved it.  One guy she sees, she makes come out to the car, pay for her cab.  He's totally nude.  When he pays for her cab?  Walk out into the street naked.  That's part of the gig?  Part of the gig.  It's the public humiliation.  And she'll put him in a rabbit outfit or something.  I should call her and ask her.  Check in at the Overlook Hotel?  Yeah.  Get a room upstairs? 
[01:21:30]  Great party.  Yeah, and then she'll bury an axe in someone's chest.  No, but she said these guys are real wacko.  She's hardcore, man.  She's really nice.  Wow.  I don't see her in that capacity.  Fast forward to the police station.  You're dressed in.  Yeah.  In a rabbit.  Oh, God.  I didn't know it'd go so far.  The cottontail part cut out.  I'm on a business trip.  And she stole my cell phone and my credit cards. 
[01:22:00]  She fell.  She fell against the headboard.  I, we were, it never meant to happen.  We've done this before, but she fell.  What am I going to tell my wife and four kids?  You sure have thought about that earlier, sir.  Whose costume are you wearing?  Oh, God.  I'm in the costume.  I didn't even think about.  Blood all over the costume where he was cradling her.  Her head that cracked open on the headboard. 
[01:22:30]  I don't know.  A bloody bunny costume.  And blood where the tail is, which is what started this whole aggression on his part.  Why he pushed her off and she hit the headboard.  Absolutely.  And something that looks like the missile that launched XM with crimson all over it.  I don't know why this thing makes me laugh so hard.  Because it's such an uncomfortable situation.  He's totally screwed.  Right.  I never cheated on my wife before.  The guy's talked me into this at the office. 
[01:23:00]  I'm a family man.  I got a father-son picnic with my son tomorrow at the school.  Oh, I can't get stitches.  Oh, my God.  He's at the police station in a bloody prison.  Dead Dom in the morgue.  He's screwed.  He has to walk gingerly around the house to hide the shame.  And he only eats applesauce and pudding for two weeks. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, my God.  Every morning, she hears her husband in the bathroom screaming.  Eating his Cheerios in his bowl with one big blow-up Cheerio on his seat.  The wife's just look of contempt on her face for him.  She's just buying her time.  The house is mortgaged now for bail. 
[01:24:00]  Just because he killed the hooker.  I love this story.  He has to gingerly walk all over there.  Oh.  14 dissolvable stitches.  Dissolvable.  Take another sitz bath with some Epsom salt.  He's got to sit in a little bin of Epsom salt every night to prevent infection in that germy area. 
[01:24:30]  Now, remember, applesauce and pudding.  We'll try to get you on more solid foods in a couple of weeks.  You don't want to tear the stitches.  I can't have peanuts.  No.  No.  Popcorn.  And then when you think you're going to get bad enough, you have to leave the police station.  You're still in the rabbit outfit.  And then the meteors are on fire.  They take you to another location.  Daddy, I can't even go to school anymore. 
[01:25:00]  You're the laughing stock.  They call you the bunny man.  They call you bunny butt man.  I love it.  Oh, I love if every one of these situations just turns out like this.  Oh.  It's too disturbing.  There was a dom in Boston who died recently.  And he had a heart attack on the rack.  And this selfish bitch was worried about herself and let him suffer for like five minutes and die. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, my God.  And they chopped up the body.  They didn't kill him.  They just didn't help him.  Yeah.  That's not helping when you let him die and then chop him up.  You got the dead hooker.  You're in the bunny rabbit outfit.  You didn't call your one trusting friend to chop up the hooker with you.  Oh, before the cops get there?  Bobby, you got to help me out, man. 
[01:26:00]  Mark in Boston, yes, I said buying her time.  I'm sorry.  I was excited about her.  I was excited about our scenario.  Yes, I did say that.  Oh, I got tears, man.  I don't know why that makes me laugh.  Oh, it's such a great.  Holy crap.  You're screwed moment.  And it's not you.  This is great, isn't it?  I don't know why I enjoy that, too.  That's the only fantasizing I want to do as far as Adam is concerned. 
[01:26:30]  She's dead.  The businessman's life is ruined.  His family disgraced.  It's just a business trip that went awry.  Oh.  Oh.  It's having a little fun.  You want a naughty nurse fantasy?  Some 300-pound homoerotic man comes in and smothers you in white shoes.  Dr. Death is here.  Oh, Dr. Death. 
[01:27:00]  I hope you brought the hot girl.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that is great, man.  We were laughing.  It's just that scene out of Godfather 2.  The politician.  We're sitting there on the bed and the hooker is just bleeding from everywhere.  I wish we were just hearing it.  I don't know what happened.  I fell asleep.  Don't worry. 
[01:27:30]  The Corleone family will take care of it.  Yeah, it's just...  Viteau Corleone.  It's just every bad movie.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's a cute story.  We begin in Erie, Pennsylvania, where Tritoria Graham actually swung her infant through the  air to strike her boyfriend.  The baby is four months old.  She's been charged with aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, and simple assault.  Unfortunately, the child is not doing very well.  He is listed as serious but stable.  Authorities, meantime, have removed four other children from Graham's home. 
[01:28:00]  Did you charge the kid?  Yeah, right?  You don't hit someone with a kid like that.  You chain two kids' feet together and go at them with kid chucks.  You're just swinging them around.  Like a mace.  You put a metal hat on one.  Go, Capa.  That's one of the crazy stories today.  That's wonderful.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, just if you get a chance, look at the names of people involved. 
[01:28:30]  If you get a chance.  That's all I'm saying.  John Smith?  Not even close.  Johnny Smith?  No, you're not even close.  No.  No.  No, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Is Lewis here? 
[01:29:00]  Shitoria Graham.  Really?  This is her name.  She was the baby swinger.  She was the one hitting her boyfriend with her own baby.  Really?  Shitoria Graham.  Why would a white person have a name like that?  I wasn't even implying any type of race.  I just found the name interesting.  Hello.  Where are you going with this?  Hello, Twitchels.  Yo, what's up, man?  Look who it is. 
[01:29:30]  It's Lewis Twitchels Santani.  You lost some weight.  Did you?  Yeah, yeah.  I lost about 15 more.  Did you?  Yeah.  Yeah, you lost some weight.  Yeah, I've been working out, trying.  Yeah.  Every day's a workout, though, isn't it?  Yeah, right?  Just kind of muscles, always using your muscles.  Twitch there, lose a couple calories.  Yeah.  You should have a six-pack at this point.  Well, I still have all the loose skin, actually.  I still haven't been able to get rid of that.  We haven't seen that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's your favorite. 
[01:30:00]  Now, apparently, MTV is doing your show that you taped here and at other places.  Right.  True Life, I have Tourette's.  True Life, I have Tourette's, and it's going to be a whole big, big to-do about you and  what, a day in the life or a couple of days?  Oh, it's not just about me.  It's actually a full-hour special featuring three people with Tourette's, myself and two  others.  One who's actually a senior, is a girl who's a senior in high school.  Very, very gorgeous girl. 
[01:30:30]  Pretty girl, nice body, except she has Tourette's.  And a biker's been in the X Games and everything as well.  So it's going to pretty much follow our three stories.  What do you do in the X Games?  Not me.  I'm talking about the other guy.  That's what I said.  What do you do in the X Games?  He's one of those, like, motorcyclists that does, like, the flips and everything like  that off the ramps, and then home in his room.  He was just trying to ride the motorcycle, twitching, spinning upside down.  Any of the footage from in-studio make the special? 
[01:31:00]  Actually, MTV did tell me, like, the footage that we shot here and during the walkover, it  actually did make it on it.  So there will be O.P. and Anthony footage on tonight, 10 o'clock p.m. on MTV.  Tonight, 10 o'clock.  Nice.  Tuning in.  Twitchels.  I have a question, too.  Yeah, go ahead.  Did we have to, was it awkward walking in and you and Kenny seeing each other?  No, no, not at all.  Not.  Yeah, not at all.  It's no big deal.  Kenny looks happy.  No, he looks thrilled. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, that was a big.  You cursed out Kenny last time.  That was a big moment.  I remember that.  Yes, yes.  That was the weeping Louis Twitchels and Tanny in the hotel at, where was that, Worcester?  Worcester.  Worcester.  There was a little problem with the petting zoo.  Yes.  And your security issues.  That's correct.  That's you had had, and you brought these up to Kenny, and Kenny's response was not what  you would have liked it to have been. 
[01:32:00]  And you left the venue, went back to the hotel, and that's where I found him walking down the  hallway as I was leaving to go to the venue.  And needless to say, a very upset Louis Twitchels and Tanny that day.  Wasn't too happy, no.  No.  It was kind of sad.  I wish I had a box of sentiments at the time, Jimmy, actually.  That might have helped.  Kenny kind of got into it on the phone.  I actually forgot about that until you accepted him.  Yeah.  Right, right.  Because Kenny was just like, oh, got to deal with him. 
[01:32:30]  You know, not too happy.  Have you guys exchanged any words today?  Say that again.  Have you exchanged any words today?  Pleasantries?  No, not at all.  Not at all.  Think things will ever be patched up between the two of yous?  I mean, I could really care less, to be honest with you.  Oh, oh, oh.  No, I don't mean that in a disrespectful way.  I just, I don't let it faze me.  I'm not letting it faze me now, you know?  So.  So what you're saying is Kenny isn't worth your time, you know?  I don't think any of that stuff's worth the aggravation. 
[01:33:00]  I wish him the best, and obviously he's doing well, so.  I hope, you know, I have nothing else to say about it.  You seem too calm today.  You want to try one of these cocaine drinks?  No, thank you.  No, thank you.  Why not?  See, that was the whole thing.  I hated, you know, eventually it was just, you know, after doing the show so much, my tics  were getting so bad.  I mean, and I can't blame you guys, because I did it myself, but I just, I'm, uh, had  a lot of time to clear my head, and I'm doing a lot better now.  My tics have actually been a lot better, so. 
[01:33:30]  So we made your tics a lot worse?  But it was fun.  It was fun doing it, but, yeah, I can't say it was you guys, no.  You know, it was everything.  Jump.  I'm even trying to control that right now.  Jump.  Control what?  The jumping thing.  The jumping thing?  It's hard, right?  It's hard to control the jumping thing?  Sometimes.  He, um, he, um, I, I don't think Lewis really enjoyed, um, what, what had become of the  Lewis Twitchell-Sentani character.  Right, right.  Uh, toward the end of his, uh, tenure here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:34:00]  And, uh, he's trying to, you know, break out of that a little bit.  Well, look, don't get me wrong.  I mean, I, I gotta tell you, you guys have done so much for me.  I love being on the show.  I love you guys.  It really is a fun time coming here.  I travel two and a half hours from Philadelphia every time I come here.  And, uh, no complaints.  And it's definitely worth it for me.  But I wish, I do wish there is other facets of the show that I could, you know, expand  on.  I wish there's other things I could do.  No, no, like.  This speech.  No, no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.  We've heard this speech over here.  We've heard this one before.  It's honestly not what you think.  Oh, my God. 
[01:34:30]  No, you know, it's, think what you will of.  Thank God we filmed a lot of your appearances on our show and people can enjoy it for years  to come on YouTube.  I'm not looking for Intelligent Hour with Twitchells or anything like that.  You are here to jump.  Imagine if Einstein said he wanted to play the loot.  You are here to bring.  That's the thing.  I'm not saying I want to play the loot.  You know, I.  You are here to, uh, you are here to eat, uh, Almond Joys until you puke.  That is Twitchells.  What do you want to do?  Is Sting going to be on, uh. 
[01:35:00]  Say that again, Jimmy?  The Today Show.  I don't know.  I, I, I, is he?  I saw, uh, they, they played a clip of him.  Or looting?  So, perhaps, uh, we should, yeah, take a look at that.  It's all about the loot today.  I'm telling you.  It's a stupid loot.  And if it's not him looting live, I want to hear what his interview was and hear how  pompous and stupid he sounds.  I can't wait for the loot to go back into the way, way past.  What, what is it, jump, that you want to do?  Jump, jump, jump, jump.  Might as well jump.  Jump, jump. 
[01:35:30]  Say that again, Jimmy?  What is it that you want to do?  I mean, you've already had the public flow out with club soda.  I mean, I mean, no.  Ideal, ideally, what would you like your contribution to this program to be?  Besides jumping.  Yeah, look, I'm not saying, I'm not saying that I want to do anything, you know, that  you're too far different than what I've already been doing.  Like I said, I'm not complaining.  You know, I definitely have a good time when I do.  So why don't you drink a cocaine?  I gotta be honest with you.  Drink cocaine.  No, I don't want cocaine.  It's three times the caffeine of, I think, a Red Bull, something like that. 
[01:36:00]  But to answer your question.  There's like three Red Bulls.  I know, I would never do that.  I would go nuts.  How about you just, here, here, here.  I'm not going to have it.  Why don't you just take a look at the.  Well, let me tell you what, can I answer your question?  The can there.  I would like to do like celebrity interviews.  I've done a lot of celebrity interviews for different radio shows.  Celebrity interviews, all right.  No, like correspondent type stuff.  And I've had a lot of fun doing that.  You know, I thought something like that would be something I might want to try.  For other stations, resume?  Resume?  Who, what stations have you done that for, sir? 
[01:36:30]  Well, the Cousin Ed show on YSP in Philadelphia.  Who have you interviewed?  Christopher Knight, Adrian Curry, King Kong Bundy.  Quite a list.  No, I mean, you know, I'm not talking like Tom Cruise here.  But, you know, I've had some experience interviewing personalities.  And it's a fun time.  And my Tourette's had definitely been vivid during that.  And, you know, the people just seemed to let it flow.  And it's, you know, I think it could be pretty good stuff.  What exactly is in it, Obi? 
[01:37:00]  The cocaine.  What does that mean?  It's just a heavy-duty Red Bull.  It's like Red Bull, yeah.  It's all the rage.  Yeah, about times three.  Yeah.  That's nice.  So, you will be opening that can.  How is it?  You can't help yourself.  Is it good or no?  I haven't tried it.  I can't drink cola.  So, you're saying.  It tastes like Coke.  Someone said it tastes like cola.  I don't know.  What does it taste like?  Someone says it burns going down a little bit.  Do you want to try it?  No.  You like them.  I gave it to you because you like the Red Bull.  I've seen you have a lot of Red Bull over the last year. 
[01:37:30]  Yes, yes.  Just at least open the can and take a sip.  That's all we ask.  See what it tastes like, I guess.  See what it tastes like.  I just can't drink caffeine.  I have no idea.  I didn't even know it was a cola, is it?  True Life with Twitchells tonight on MTV.  10 o'clock p.m.  10 o'clock p.m.  Is it a cola?  It kind of smells like, you know, strawberry vomit.  I don't know.  They say it doesn't taste that good.  It doesn't smell good either, so.  They say it doesn't taste that great.  It's a cola-ish. 
[01:38:00]  That's my only thing.  Big A talks about the cocaine energy drink on YouTube, by the way.  Did he try something?  He was just trying to tell the kids how bad it is.  Ah.  For the kids.  It's bubbling.  Yeah, it's carbonated.  Let's try it.  It's good.  All right.  Well, you asked me to take one sip, and I agree.  I'll take one sip.  All right.  Why don't you take one sip?  Let's see what it tastes like.  Yeah.  It kind of tastes like, you know, the time after Dominatrix. 
[01:38:30]  I'm with the Dominatrix.  Is that bad?  Yeah.  It kind of had like a nasty aftertaste.  What's the aftertaste?  Is it like a cola going down, though?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's actually like a...  Describe it based on things that people would know.  A very sour, sour cherry soda that you think was left out in the sun, but it's still cold.  Like, bitter.  Well, why don't you...  My tongue's kind of burning.  Well, make sure...  Yeah, people say it burns.  Let's take another sip there, just to make sure. 
[01:39:00]  I don't know if I want to.  How much carbon...  Is it like when you...  Can you hold it in your mouth for a second before you swallow it?  Like, is it nasty?  I haven't taken it.  Hmm.  Does it foam up a lot?  Heavily carbonated or no?  Gabo.  Gabo?  Gabo, right, of course.  Yeah, that's Tourette for delicious.  A little Gabo.  I like to work.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm definitely not taking any more.  Nah.  All right.  Well, it's either that or the door. 
[01:39:30]  Burning?  Your choice.  A little burning?  It is definitely...  What does it taste like, though?  Well, if you're so curious, why don't you have a sip?  You have...  I'm asking you.  Hey.  I'm asking you.  Well, Opie, there's three cans right next to you.  I'm asking you.  You are.  I'm not the monkey boy.  Do you have some bolas and can you take a sipper?  Ooh.  I'm being honest.  I'll tell you what.  I'll down a can with you.  You want to down a can with me, Opie? 
[01:40:00]  Oh, you're the monkey boy.  I'm the monkey boy.  Yes.  Come on.  I'm the...  I'm the...  Opie, the whip master.  That's right.  And you're...  The not whip master.  Well, I just took two sips.  Drink for your supper.  You're going to have three, dude.  Yeah.  I don't want any more.  It's kind of growing on you.  It's just sitting there.  I'm only going to drink more if you do.  Oh, no.  I don't do dares.  Who said it was a dare? 
[01:40:30]  I didn't play.  No.  It's not good.  We got the show.  We got the exposure.  You make your decision.  That's fine.  So what do you...  Is it a free world?  It doesn't taste good.  I don't want any more.  All right.  Well, you're on True Life tonight, MTV, 10 o'clock, right?  Yes, sir.  10 o'clock p.m. tonight, MTV.  Any apologies to Kenny?  What do you don't feel there?  If he asks them for me, then I'll be willing to try to accept them. 
[01:41:00]  Kenny, would you apologize to...  Can we get Kenny and Mike?  Kenny, really fast.  We got to take a break.  We're like really late this time around.  Kenny, would you apologize to Louis Twitchell Santani?  Of course.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Sorry, Kenny.  Go ahead.  Of course, because I'm the better person.  Oh.  Okay.  You know.  If Kenny apologizes to you, will you take another sip?  I think that's fair.  Sure.  Sure.  Absolutely.  A big sip, though.  Yes.  I'll take a big sip.  I'm sorry that the situation happened. 
[01:41:30]  Anyway, no.  That's not good enough.  That's not good enough.  Wait a minute.  You're sorry that the situation...  You know what?  You know what?  I'm not going to go to a core about this.  You're right.  And you know what?  I'm sorry the situation happened, too, Kenny.  I really am.  And I'll take a sip just for you.  I thought you wouldn't take another sip.  No, he said...  I said that if you apologized...  Right, Jimmy?  And that was a gulp.  Thank you.  That was a gulp.  I got to say, Louis didn't seem particularly happy with Kenny's apology.  No, but I took it. 
[01:42:00]  And, you know, I appreciate it.  I really do.  I don't think you do appreciate it, though.  And only because I don't think that you have to...  No, I just...  You know, I took a second thought.  And I do appreciate it because I probably took a lot for you.  So I appreciate it.  Did it take a lot for you, Kenny?  You know, Louis seems to have a way about him.  But, you know, I don't excuse him for calling me a liar and saying all those nasty words to me on the radio.  That was a little awkward.  Yeah.  That was awkward for everybody.  Yeah.  I apologize for that, for going over the top with those words.  All right.  Okay.  I let my anger get the best of me. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  We got to...  We have to take a break.  Can we address this when we come back for a minute?  Yeah, of course.  I want it to be wrapped up for the listeners because we get a lot of feedback about it.  Kenny, can you walk Twitchell's back to the green room?  He's a big boy.  I think you need to walk him back to the green room.  Go old school.  Yeah.  Okay.  Old school?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No one's looking.  Let's go.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Call the Opie and Anthony show right now.  866-313-313.  ONA, who's this? 
[01:43:00]  Hi.  I'm Cody.  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So, why'd you call?  The man on the radio said I should call.  Oh, fantastic.  Hang on.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the Opie and Anthony show  at 866-313-BREE.  Okay, bye.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, Twitchells, how's that cocaine drink? 
[01:43:30]  Still tastes pretty bad.  When you're drinking?  Actually, it's horrible.  But you are drinking it, right?  I had a couple sips back there.  Yes.  You know, when it's in your hand, it's just kind of in front of you.  But I don't like it.  I'm not going to have another one.  Is it burn going down or no?  It's still half full.  Take a sip.  Tell me how long you can hold it in your mouth.  Like, no.  When you sip it and drink it, how long after it goes down does it burn?  Because someone said it has like an afterburn to it, which is kind of like regular soda,  actually.  And we should do some plugs.  You're going to be on something tonight. 
[01:44:00]  Don't you dare say it.  If you drink the cocaine, you get your plugs.  You'll get a huge, huge audience tonight.  It's not bad.  It's not that bad of a burn?  It's not bad of a burn at all.  I'm actually, can I be honest?  I'm not even feeling that peppy yet.  That's fine.  All right, then drink a little more.  I'm drinking.  You have a high tolerance for caffeine because you drank a lot of...  I've been drinking coffee since I was 13.  Hurry up.  We've got a big star I'm seeing on the hotline here.  Oh, MTV's True Life. 
[01:44:30]  What?  What?  You got a swig.  You want me to take a drink?  I just took a sip.  Here, I'll take another one.  And you said you do celebrity interviews.  All right, there you go.  There's a big swig.  Now you can promote what you're promoting today.  Well, MTV's True Life might have Tourette's Syndrome.  Mayors tonight at 10 p.m. on MTV.  So it's True Life.  I have Tourette's.  And you're drinking the liquid cocaine drink.  It's kind of like Red Bull, but like three times the strength, okay?  Let's say hi to Jeff Daniels.  Jeff.  How you doing, guys?  Sorry to make you wait.  I apologize.  We're backed up a little bit today. 
[01:45:00]  No, I was just listening to all the cocaine talk.  Brought back the 80s.  Yeah.  Back in the good old days.  There's a new energy drink out there called cocaine, and everyone's up in arms because,  you know, it's an energy drink, and they think the kids are going to get the wrong impression,  blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  Well, next it'll be, you know, crystal meth tea and, you know.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, are you a Tigers fan?  A huge Tiger fan, yeah.  So, what did you think?  Obviously, you were excited Saturday, huh? 
[01:45:30]  Well, I was there Saturday, and, I mean, it's 19 years.  I mean, I know the Yankees, I mean, they were going for their 27th World Series and this  and that, but a friend of mine said it, and it's true, you know, when the Yankees win,  there's relief, and when the Tigers won after 19 years of just being horrible, I mean, there  was such joy in Detroit, and, I mean, it was just a great place to be on Saturday.  You mean relief because they're kind of expected to win, the Yankees?  Well, yeah, and certainly the way the Tigers ended the season, there was no reason to think 
[01:46:00]  the Yankees wouldn't just sweep them, but, you know, the kids kind of started believing  in themselves in game two, and, you know, basically, we had the pitching.  Where are you from?  Oh, Michigan, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Michigan, right near Detroit.  But it's weird, everyone's looking at this like it was a huge upset victory.  The Tigers were one of the best teams in baseball this season.  Well, we were, I mean, as far as number of victories, but, you know, through the season,  we didn't play well against the Yankees or the Red Sox or the White Sox, so against the 
[01:46:30]  really good teams, we had trouble.  But, you know, we showed up when it counted.  Can I tell you how much I loved you in terms of endearment when you changed cities just to  keep banging the girl behind Debra Winger's back?  Jimmy likes movies for different reasons.  Oh, that was a great one.  Other people were moved by the emotion in the story, but, yeah, no, that's cool.  Yeah, to me, there was a back story where she didn't feel well, and Nicholson had a whole 
[01:47:00]  thing going on, but to me, you hitting that other chick and just switching jobs was the  main focus.  When she's dying of cancer, I'm hitting this other chick.  I know, how do you not love him in that film?  I wanted to hug you through the whole movie, you were my idol on every level.  Hey, Jeff, what movie do people bring up all the time?  I mean, there's so many that you were in, but which is the one that everyone talks about?  Dumb and Dumber?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Dumb and Dumber is, you know, you got the Civil War guys with Gettysburg and the  Terms of Endearments and stuff like that, but, yeah, Dumb and Dumber is the one that, 
[01:47:30]  you know, swept the world.  You know, I saw that little artsy flick called Squid and the Whale.  Last year?  Yeah, well, there's that one, yeah.  I actually, I liked that a lot.  That was a really good movie.  How creepy was that, working with Anna Paquin as, like, you know, you had worked with her  as your daughter.  Well, I mean, actors have to do strange things, you know, often, but that one certainly was  up there.  A little odd.  We did a Fly Away Home together when Anna was 13, I think, maybe 12. 
[01:48:00]  And then, you know, 10 years later, here she is in her 20s and we're, you know, having  this affair on film and it's just, you know, you just kind of look out the window, make  sure there aren't any geese, and then go at it.  Let me ask you, this is kind of a novice, stupid question.  Who's the most intimidating actor you ever did a scene with, that you were, like, just  blown away to be doing a scene with him, that you were afraid you were going to suck?  What's that?  No, Meryl, Meryl Streep. 
[01:48:30]  Okay.  Because she's so good.  I mean, she's just, everything you ever learn, you need to bring because you're going to  need it.  And she couldn't, you know, she's very nice, she's easy to talk to and all of that, but  between action and cut, I mean, it's like getting in there against Ali, you know, in  his prime.  I mean, she's just really good.  She'll make you better if you let her.  He rope-a-doped her.  She was doing the scene, he acted like he wasn't doing well.  And then she pulled up and he hit her.  And she couldn't confuse you easily because she's so good. 
[01:49:00]  What did you do with Meryl Streep?  I had a scene or two in The Hours, and then I had a few scenes in the Heartburn movie.  Heartburn.  Nice.  Yeah, you've been very diverse in your career, which is good, I guess.  You know, doing like Dumb and Dumber and then working with Meryl Streep.  You know, a lot of people could get typecast.  Well, I just didn't, you know, right or wrong, I didn't want to do that.  You know, I didn't, you know, in Hollywood, and it's been, you know, for decades.  If you look at Gable and Tracy and those guys, I mean, they were really great, but he created 
[01:49:30]  kind of an image and stuck to that more often than not.  And I just, you know, I moved back to Michigan in the middle 80s after about 10 years in New  York, and I just, I wanted to raise the family here and do the thing here.  And I just figured I may as well have as wide a range as possible, because if I can go  from a Dumb and Dumber to a Squid and a Whale, there are a lot of jobs in between there.  And like Clint Eastwood, I did a movie with Clint called Blood Work, and he said, if you  can do Dumb and Dumber, you can, you know, and you can do, you know, Pleasantville or Two 
[01:50:00]  Days in the Valley, he said, you can do this.  And so it created jobs.  Do you know what I find?  I've done a little acting myself.  Oh, boy.  And I always find two things I have trouble with, or the two first things.  I never know what to do with my hands.  I'm not sure where they go.  Like, I'm really good at a table.  Like, if we're sitting down doing a scene, I'm terrific.  But as soon as we have to move around the room, I kind of fall apart.  And I like to act with my face.  Like, whatever emotion I think is called for, I make that face as I'm talking.  Oh, my God, you must suck. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah, get that in a promo, Jim Daniels.  Put your hands in your pockets and don't take them out.  That said, everyone's standing in our room with their hands in their pockets.  But even that looks awkward when Jimmy does this.  But don't you ever, like, what do you do with them, dude?  Like, if I stand there, I just feel like, okay, left hand is out a little.  I feel like a stupid posing statue.  I can never be natural.  Well, first of all, you're thinking about your hands.  Let's start there.  You're right.  Yeah.  What do you do?  Just stop. 
[01:51:00]  Just act naturally.  Don't do anything.  Put your hands at your side or put them in your pockets.  And then, you know, and just when you need to use them, they will come out.  Yeah, he's right.  He's always, like, moving them like they should be moved instead of just leaving them.  Or if they're by his side, he looks like a robot.  Yeah, like I make sweeping motions, like all the way to the right, all the way to the left while I'm talking.  It's awful.  Like I'm making proclamations.  Perhaps it's time to reconsider the career choice.  Well, acting, I just kind of do.  I mean, you know what I mean? 
[01:51:30]  A lot of people, I kind of think I'm a natural.  Jim Norton is a big-time comedian, Jeff Daniels.  That's funny.  He goes, you must suck.  Jesus, he's right.  Yeah.  Completely.  Well, Jeff is calling because he's got a new CD out live and unplugged to benefit the Purple Rose Theater.  Is this your first CD, Jeff?  Yeah, it is.  And we didn't know you did this.  Well, nobody does.  It's kind of the last thing the world needs is another actor, singer, songwriter.  Trust me.  But I have a theater company, Purple Rose.  And about five years ago, they pushed me on stage to raise some money. 
[01:52:00]  And, you know, it worked.  And over the five years, every Christmas week, New Year's week, I'd do these five or ten shows.  And we recorded them.  And I'd start to write specifically for the show.  And a lot of the stuff is funny and aimed right at being performed live.  And so we put the CD out hoping to, you know, raise some more money for the non-profit theater.  And, you know, it got picked up nationally.  And I don't suck.  I saw that.  Some people do know because I saw a TV little special on you. 
[01:52:30]  And it had you there in Michigan and in Chelsea.  And it showed your theater and you in Chelsea kind of just, like, hanging out.  It was the oddest thing.  It's like, here's a guy who's been in a bunch of movies.  And he's just, you know, hanging out, playing with his family in his house.  You're so not Hollywood.  Oh, Michigan.  Well, I just never bought it.  I never, to be honest, I never thought it would last. 
[01:53:00]  And it usually doesn't, you know, for actors.  You have your three or four movies and then you go away, you know.  So you went away before they told you to go away, but then they never told you to go away.  Yeah, I'm fatalistic about it.  You know, I moved after ten years in New York and moved back to Michigan hoping that when it did, when it was over, I'd be home already.  I wouldn't have to be home.  So, but, you know, it kept going.  And then, of course, Dumb and Dumber bought me another ten years.  And then, you know.  And another house.  Yeah, and another house. 
[01:53:30]  What?  But, so it's been good.  But the theater and the CD has been a lot of fun to do.  And, you know, there's so, I mean, right off the bat, I start off with a song, If William Shatner Can, I Can Too.  So, you know, it's not me trying to do Bob Dylan, that's for sure.  Well, there's another song on here called The Lifelong Tiger Fan Blues.  You're going to have to update that one.  Well, I did.  I rewrote it in August, and we actually made a little music video of it here in Detroit with the local Tigers, you know, broadcast station.  And they've been playing it on the pregame. 
[01:54:00]  And, yeah, now it's more of a celebration of all things Tigers.  All you bastards doing that.  I swear to God, you all jinxed the Yankees by doing that.  Like Stephen King decided he was going to write a whole book about the misery of being a Red Sox fan.  And the Sox, of course, destroyed the Yankees in that playoff series.  The Yankees have bigger problems than what we might be doing.  But I think it's supernatural.  Because then they made that goddamn stupid Adam Sandler movie, and it was supposed to end with, again, another Red Sox loss. 
[01:54:30]  Fever pitch.  And what happened?  Jinxed.  And then you write this song about the Tigers.  And what, was it supposed to be about the hardships of being a Tiger fan?  Well, or just the difficulty in playing a team with a $200 million payroll.  You know, versus like that.  Oh, he took a shot.  Yeah, I understand.  And we were getting along here and everything.  Oh, everything was.  I think we got off on the wrong foot for the baseball talk. 
[01:55:00]  I'm thinking we're going to exchange numbers at the end of this phone call.  It's going so well.  Hey, if my Mets get knocked out, Tigers all the way.  That's what I say, Jeff.  Oh, that'd be fun.  I mean, just the Tigers going all the way, but the Tigers and Mets would be a lot of fun.  And finally, what's your stand on the loot?  The what?  Exactly.  The what, indeed, sir.  Jimmy and I went and saw Sting last night, and he's looting.  Oh, boy.  He's playing the loot.  Oh, boy.  Have you ever gotten a massage in a place where they offer you a little extra for a little extra? 
[01:55:30]  That's the music you hear in the background.  Oh, boy.  Sting is now singing to it.  How much does a ticket cost to see Sting play the loot?  We were lucky to get free tickets.  I have no idea.  But that's what he's doing.  He's taking the songs of this guy, John Dowlin.  Now, you would think, John Dowlin, didn't he play with a band back in 68 or something?  No.  Maybe 1568.  It's a guy from the 1500s.  He is pulling musicians out from the 1500s and covering their songs. 
[01:56:00]  Play, guy, can't stand losing you.  That's right.  That's right.  Every song sounded like a Christmas song, the same Christmas song.  Unless he's doing a funny dance while he's playing the loot.  I'm not sure about that.  Exactly.  He sat there.  Mr. Sting takes himself way too seriously.  But you don't have to comment because I'm sure you hang out with him.  No, I don't.  Because everyone in Hollywood hangs out with each other. 
[01:56:30]  Years ago, and to be honest, he was playing the loot at the time.  In the restaurant.  Wow, what a coincidence.  Hey, do you have any famous, like, who's a famous friend that you, like, hang out with a lot?  I feel like, I really, believe me, I realize, by the way, that that's a fat Midwestern housewife question I just asked you.  I don't.  You know, I don't.  I mean, I live in Michigan, so I don't.  I mean, there are people I might see whom I've worked with, but, you know, it really is more kind of a gypsy kind of, you know, you work together, and then you see each other every day, and then you don't see each other for five years, and then you see them at some thing. 
[01:57:00]  And, hey, you know, it's like old times, but it's, no, no.  Yeah, Jeff kind of stepped out of that whole thing.  Yeah, I'm not there.  I like the fact he moved back to Michigan just in case he fell, he wouldn't have far to go, and then all of a sudden you just stay there and nothing bad happens.  You beat the system.  There's an aircraft if he's got to make a movie.  Well, good luck with the CD, man. 
[01:57:30]  It's for a good cause.  It's to benefit with the Purple Roach Theater.  Yeah, it is.  And how can people get it?  JeffDaniels.com.  That's the easiest way.  Okay, and it's called Jeff Daniels Live and Unplugged, and I can't read the bottom because it's such a small print.  Oh, what's it say there in front of you?  Wait, Unplugged to benefit the Purple Roach Theater.  And you're performing in New York?  Yeah, I'm going to play Birdland in November.  I'm going to play in Philly in a couple of weeks and World Cafe and then out in Portland, Oregon, I think. 
[01:58:00]  All right, and you have a website for all the dates?  Yeah, JeffDaniels.com.  They can find everything there.  Hey, Jeff, next time you're in New York, we'd love for you to stop by and, you know, we'll talk movies.  Oh, that'd be fun.  I'd enjoy that.  Maybe we'll go get a burger, you know.  I want to do a scene with you.  Start a friendship.  Me and Jeff will do a scene.  Something with a lot of hand motion.  Yes, we'll do a scene.  We'll both play flapping birds.  We'll do a walk and talk where we use our hands.  All right, Jeff, thank you so much for calling the show today.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, guys.  Appreciate it.  All right, it's Jeff Daniels, everyone. 
[01:58:30]  Very cool guy.  He's a nice guy.  Hey, Twitchels, how's the cocaine?  It's growing on me.  Yeah.  It's growing on me a tad bit.  Is it burned less when it goes down now?  Yes.  Okay.  Why don't you take another swig and then we'll get another plug in for what's going on with  you tonight.  It's actually very cool.  And are we featured in this special?  We're definitely featured?  Yeah.  Tonight it's true life.  I have Tourette's on MTV at 10 p.m.  Also, go to Twitchels.com for more info on that.  You guys are in it.  You saw the squid and the whale?  Thank you, man.  Yeah.  You did? 
[01:59:00]  Did you see it?  No.  Does he have makeout scenes with Anna Panquin?  With a young chick.  Was that Anna?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I forgot because it's been over a year now.  I'm so frigging sick.  Why?  She was like a little kid.  He played her dad.  In the geese movie.  Yeah.  Remember the movie where the geese and he had a hangliner with a motor?  Well, that's what he said.  Fly away home.  Fly away home.  That's why he said make sure there's no geese outside the window and he goes to town.  Oh.  That's where the reference was from.  That's really funny.  And she was like a little kid.  That's really funny.  None of us picked up on it. 
[01:59:30]  I forgot about the geese movie.  And then years later, he's kissing her.  Oh, that is so weird.  Well, I mean, Tom Cruise just did War of the Worlds.  Believe me, you know, he was looking at Dakota going soon.  A couple of years.  Yep.  We're doing a movie together because you're taller than me.  A couple of weeks.  No, he was looking at Dakota's brother.  I just did a Dakota and Tom Cruise short joke.  I really should put on a house coat.  Jesus.  We're going to bring out a big watermelon for you to smash at the end of the show.  From now on, every time I talk, hang up laundry so I can lean over it like you're my neighbor's fat wash woman I am. 
[02:00:00]  I go to the Archie Theater in my neighborhood every once in a while, and they serve smoked salmon sandwiches.  I talk about them all the time, and The Squid and the Whale got massive reviews, so I went.  It's one of those movies no one's going to see, but it got like five, well, what did they go up to, four?  Four stars.  Five stars.  I don't know.  Or hots.  What's it with?  No, hogs.  Oh.  What's it about, The Squid and the Whale?  Is it about what, obviously, I think it's about? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, they get the board.  A guy with a lot of arms and a fat chick?  Yeah.  All right, let's, Mike in Pittsburgh.  Mike.  Yeah.  Yeah, welcome aboard, Mike.  How you doing, Mike?  We got to take a break, but why don't you set up what we're going to do after the break here?  You have a problem with Twitchels?  Well, first off, so there's no confusion, I got nothing but love for you guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Including you, Twitchels.  Thank you.  Some confusion.  I got Tourette's, too.  Yeah.  Right.  And what's your problem with it?  My arms, I twitch them constantly. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  And my neck.  But it just seems like you're overselling it.  Me?  Yeah.  Who's overselling what?  Twitchels, he thinks, is overselling it.  Oh, is overselling it.  Who, me?  Oh, me?  Yeah, but it's our job to get him in a bad place, and then he's just out of control.  I mean, every time I come here, I'm fed Red Bull and coffee, and, you know, it just makes it a lot worse.  Jump, jump, jump, jump.  Well, that's why I enjoyed the long break.  Boink.  There you go.  You happy? 
[02:01:30]  When you say jump, he has to jump there, Mike.  Mike, hold on.  We'll talk to you a little more after the break, okay?  Hold the line, Mikey.  Twitchels is an angry, bitter guy.  Very angry.  I got an idea.  Yeah.  Can we do Tourette's Day on the Opie and Anthony show?  And what would that entail?  If you have Tourette's, you come into the studio for the day.  That's right.  We could fill the studio with people with Tourette's.  We could fill the entire studio with people with Tourette's.  You should have come.  And then they came with me to the Tourette's.  And we'll have arts and crafts and little things they could have fun doing. 
[02:02:00]  When was it that he made some?  What?  We absolutely should have sent somebody.  Where was it?  Well, I call it the Tourette's Convention.  It's the National Conference, TSA.  Hundreds of people with Tourette's all in one hotel.  It was in April.  I talked about it on the show.  Yeah, we should.  Everyone is beating you up, and it was Jimmy Fallon, not Adam Sandler.  It's all right, man.  It's the same movie.  You could have dumped Adam Sandler in that role.  Don't give me crap.  And don't confuse it with Taxi with Queen Latifah, because that was a funny one.  Like, I care. 
[02:02:30]  We do five and a half hours of radio off the cuff.  Help us out sometimes.  She was sassy in that one.  Just realized that he made a silly mistake.  Sorry, I'm not IMDB in my head.  That's right.  Wes, the trucker.  Wes?  O-N-A.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Wes?  Hi, little Jimmy.  I wish.  Jeff Daniels.  I wish.  Line of the day when he told little Jimmy, God, you must suck.  Yeah, maybe that was line of the day to you, but to me, it was just one more in a series  of hurtful things. 
[02:03:00]  My vote goes to Anthony for line of the day.  We'll see what happens later on in the show.  Oops.  But Jeff is in there.  Jeff Daniels had a great line.  All right.  Thank you, Wes.  All right, boy.  Pushing out.  All right.  It's the O-N-A virus spreading across America.  Oh, oh.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit. 
[02:03:30]  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during  the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this s***.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O-N-A virus spreading across America.  Sting is on the Today Show.  Well, it's over now.  Thank God.  Sting and his loot. 
[02:04:00]  Him and his...  I finally got to see it because I didn't go with you guys.  And they just showed Sting and his loot.  And then the loot guy also playing his.  The loot guy seems much more into it than Sting does.  He's way into it.  Like, he must have taught Sting.  He did.  He was playing in a circus in Germany when Sting found him.  Some creep playing circus music that Sting fell in love with.  On a loot that has about 80 strings or something.  They had a close-up of the loot.  There were so many strings on that thing. 
[02:04:30]  It looked like a guy I saw speaking German in a video with a chicken.  So, he wasn't playing a loot.  We got Twitchels in studio.  Yo, boys.  He's going to be on True Life tonight on MTV.  Yep, True Life.  I have Treps on MTV tonight at 10 o'clock p.m.  It'll also be on Sunday at 4.  All right, how's the cocaine drink?  It's actually not too bad.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's pretty good.  It's kind of weird how you said you would not drink it and now it's pretty much gone.  Because now it's actually starting to taste a little good.  Now it's pretty much gone.  Now, yeah, this is actually my... 
[02:05:00]  I'm working on my third one.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  No wonder you're twitching like crazy now.  Rob!  Yeah, I'm here.  What's up?  Why are you being such an ass, Obie?  What do you mean?  I mean, give Twitchels a break.  I mean, he's got his own show tonight and you're pastoring him to drink the cocaine.  I mean, I just don't see it.  I don't know why you've got to be such an ass.  Such a tough guy.  Well, he didn't have to drink it.  Tough guy.  Well, no one threatened him, stupid.  I think it was cocaine or the door is what you said. 
[02:05:30]  Rob.  No, you did threaten him because you said you're not going to play his plugs unless he drinks it.  Rob, you know what?  That's a hack bit.  It's not a hack bit.  Here's the reality with this radio show.  No one wants to hear Twitchels if he's not twitching.  But no one's brave enough to say it, okay?  I have a thankless job sometimes.  I really do.  I have to be the ass.  I have to be the ass.  If Twitchels came in here and we didn't have him drinking the cocaine or the Red Bulls or the coffee and we weren't yelling jump at the guy, is that interesting radio, Rob? 
[02:06:00]  Be honest.  Well, the Almond Joys were pretty funny.  What?  And the Almond Joys, right.  All right, we're not going to make him do any of the stuff that makes people talk.  We'll just have him come in studio and we'll talk to him like a human being.  Boring.  I do that in my regular life.  God forbid you do that.  God forbid.  Well, of course.  But I will say this, Twitchels.  Right.  What?  We will let you do a celebrity interview and see how it goes.  I definitely, you know what?  I would love to do that.  I have one right here.  This is John Cena.  John Cena.  Twitchels, how you doing, man? 
[02:06:30]  I'm doing good, John.  How you doing, man?  You all hopped up on cocaine, are you?  Yeah.  They got me on my third one.  I saw you drinking Red Bull in the dressing room.  Yeah, yeah.  I was tipping back a little Red Bull, trying to get a little wake-up juice going.  Are you used to drinking a lot of energy drinks before the show?  No, no.  Just today was my first try.  I don't know if I'm up for three shots of cocaine, though.  Yeah, right?  That's three times the strength of a Red Bull.  Something like that.  Yeah, so basically, since I've had one Red Bull, you've had nine.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, that's amazing.  It's pretty crazy.  It's pretty crazy stuff.  So you got a new movie coming out, huh?  New movie's coming out this Friday.  It's called Marine. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Right?  What's the premise?  What do you think?  He's in a circus.  He's a librarian.  It's a deeply involved love story.  Yeah.  Where does it take place?  What's the premise?  Look at the size of him and the name of the film.  It's a classic action movie, man.  It's just me kicking the bad guy's ass.  I've seen the previews.  It looks pretty hot.  I definitely want to check it out.  Thanks, man.  You calling me hot?  That's weird.  That's okay.  I'm a guy with Tourette's drinking three cocaine.  That's weird, too.  Yeah, that's right.  Do you have any love scenes in it with any hot chicks? 
[02:07:30]  Believe it or not, it's a PG-13 movie, but I get to make out with Kelly Carlson.  How was it?  It was wonderful.  You're not just saying.  It was that good?  No, it was really wonderful.  She's hot.  She's smoking.  I'd like to do that.  I'd like to do that.  John Cena?  Yeah, he looked right at you and said, I'd like to do that.  I broke a sweat very fast.  It was weird.  Interview's going good, man.  You doing all right?  Well, thank you, thank you.  No, no, you're holding your own.  Just for a second, everyone started staring. 
[02:08:00]  Well, no, you know, Twitchell's like, I'll help you along.  He's in the WWE as well.  He's sort of taking the same path as The Rock, where he's going into movies now, action hero.  Yeah.  Yeah, you were talking to him about that earlier.  He was mentioning, you know, The Rock said in the beginning, you know, I definitely want  to do both.  He says, I want to keep doing it both.  But as we all know, he eventually drifted away from that.  I don't even think he wants to be called The Rock anymore.  I believe he wants to be called Dwayne Johnson.  Oh, Dwayne.  Dwayne Johnson.  Dwayne Johnson.  Dwayne.  We're back to having a problem with him, by the way.  We go back and forth. 
[02:08:30]  What happened?  Some days are good, some days are bad.  We were having a crazy radio show, and he called to promote his movie.  Yeah.  The one that just came out?  The Gridiron.  The Gridiron Gang.  Yeah.  And we didn't get to him.  Which is good, by the way.  It's a good, solid film.  We didn't get to him, and we said, call back, and then we were still in the middle of some crazy  radio thing.  And we thought he'd understand, because he's been on our show for years.  Well, just like today.  I mean, I come on in, you go, oh, man, we're running late, everything's going on.  I understand.  You guys got stuff going on all the time.  You got Twitchels over here, hopped up on three shots of cocaine.  So I hope The Rock isn't really mad at us. 
[02:09:00]  But then we're like, can you call back tomorrow?  He's like, nah, forget it.  We did promote the film.  But we did promote the film, and we loved the guy.  Yeah.  We just, you know, it was one of those things, unfortunately.  So you definitely want to stay on track and do both?  Absolutely.  You're not going to be like The Rock and just, you know, say it and then not do it.  You want to do both?  No, no, I'm definitely going to do both.  How's the schedule?  How are you juggling it?  The schedule is absolutely brutal, and it just takes losing a lot of sleep.  That's all.  Do you have any crazy stories traveling on the road with the WWE Divas?  Not necessarily with the Divas.  Because you're a ladies' man. 
[02:09:30]  I mean, let's be honest.  Well, I'll be honest.  I'm not hitting on you.  I'm not.  I'm not going back to no homo.  I'm just saying.  Do you have any interesting stories?  Hey, man, I'm not judging you.  I mean, you just...  No, as soon as I said that, as soon as I said that, I got the eye from home.  In 2006, you can do what you want to do, man.  It's all right.  Yeah, don't see it, you know.  No, I'm over here, but it's all right.  Don't worry about it.  We got some distance.  You can be who you want to be.  Don't worry about it.  No, not with the Divas.  You see them every day.  So it's like if something does happen and it doesn't work out, you got to see them every  day.  If you could have a sex scene and nail one chick in a film, who would it be? 
[02:10:00]  Oh, man.  That's a tough one.  I would...  Kathy Bates?  Yeah.  Damn, Jimmy.  You can turn around.  Who's that old broad?  Kathy Bates.  You know what?  I think Jessica Alba would probably be right up there.  Yeah, she's probably the one I'd put right up there.  Jessica Alba.  What about Scarlett?  That's reaching high.  Scarlett Johansson?  Yeah, they say she's the hottest chick in the world right now.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's a matter of opinion.  I don't know.  I'm pretty much open for anything.  Well, Twitchels is offering. 
[02:10:30]  Except, yeah.  You can bang the twitches right out of me.  Do you get a girlfriend, or do you just use your fame and hit all different shakes?  Pretty much use the fame.  How do you not love this guy?  I'm not going to dance around it.  Life is good.  I actually have a wrestling question for you.  After the shows, do you guys go out, you in particular, do you go out to the strip clubs?  Because a few months ago, there was a house show in Atlantic City that I got to see.  And afterwards, we went to a strip club, and Randy Orton and Ray Mysterio were in the strip club. 
[02:11:00]  And that's a whole other story.  It was pretty crazy, the way they behaved.  But anyway, it was just...  What, they got a lap dance?  No.  No, no.  It was like, they stayed in character.  It was pretty crazy.  They were complete jerks the whole time.  Do you try to stay in character, or are you just yourself right now?  No, I am.  I'm pretty much myself.  I can't say that I haven't been to a fine gentleman's club or two along the way.  But there's nothing wrong with kicking back after a long day.  And you'll walk in there and flaunt your stuff like you're all that, and you don't tip the girls. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, I usually walk in there, throw money up in the air, order a bunch of drinks for everybody,  buy the whole place out.  Right.  Pretty much spit on everybody because they're below me.  Oh, of course not.  Make a big scene.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Have my people call everybody's people.  No, we just kind of go out as a gang.  Some guys, maybe sometimes some guys that had a bad night.  You might have caught them on a bad night.  Right, right, right.  Anyone you have any bad blood with, or are you guys pretty much, you know...  I hate everybody.  No, I do.  I hate everybody. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, man.  He is a mess.  He's a mess now.  He really is.  I've been listening to him talk about the drink.  And he's like, oh, it's not good.  He is rifling the drink back.  No, he's like, you know, when you first try the medicine, like this really bad cough syrup,  and it's not good, but eventually you get used to it.  Like crack cocaine.  You take more than you should.  Yeah.  Almost like crack.  You know, it's really...  I never had crack.  This is the Twitchels we know and love, by the way.  Thank you, Twitchels.  I love you.  True life tonight, MTV 10 o'clock.  And for the record, Opie, I don't feel like you treat me bad all the time. 
[02:12:30]  I have a tough position.  You had the moments, though.  I have a tough position.  No one wants to hear a normal Twitchels.  Oh, boy.  The beginning of your appearance was boring.  You're like, I'm Twitchels.  I got my tics under control.  Who cares?  No, I didn't say I got them under control.  They were under control.  But obviously, three cocaine still care of that.  But how am I doing with the interview?  Wait, how many...  Much better than I expected.  How many have you drank?  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  How many have you drank?  I'm almost done.  I'm almost done.  My...  My third. 
[02:13:00]  How many grams of caffeine per drink?  That's got to be like...  It's...  I forgot now.  We did all that last week.  It's like three and a half Red Bulls.  And everyone knows what a Red Bull could do to you.  And he's had three.  So it's about ten Red Bulls.  That's nothing.  And I had heart problems when I was a kid, too.  That's probably the equivalent of like 60 cups of coffee.  That's awful.  It's got to be way up there, John.  Yeah.  We're going to do Tourette's Day on the Opie and Anthony show.  You know anybody else with Tourette's there?  You know, we don't really, you know, get together for meetings. 
[02:13:30]  It's not that we don't have a Tourette club, but there's definitely...  The TSA has a lot of connections.  We can find Tourette's.  We can find them.  All right.  John...  We'll go to coasting.  Is this your first movie, man?  This is.  My first movie.  Where'd you like...  Did you take acting lessons or did you just kind of like wing it?  Believe it or not, I kind of got thrown in the deep end.  I found out pretty much last minute that I was doing this gig.  I got acting lessons for around a month and a half before and then all the time that we  filmed for about three and a half months on the set.  Someone like...  Like if the scene didn't go good, someone like, all right, we'll try this.  Yeah, and it was, I mean, it was a good time. 
[02:14:00]  I was, you know, I was doing it for the first time and our director, John Bonito, was the  first time director and we kind of, I came to the understanding that I'm like, hey, man,  I'm new at this.  You got to help me out.  I told everybody, you know, this is my first run, so you got to kind of help me out.  It was a good time, man.  It was a good time filming and it came out pretty decent.  What was the hardest part of acting?  Like what was the most...  Toning it down.  Oh, yeah?  WWE, Monday Night Raw, man, is huge.  You got to be huge.  You got to be animated.  You got to be intense and when you're filming inside that box, every little, you know, for  cinema, every little motion means... 
[02:14:30]  You got to use a little bit of subtlety.  Yeah, yeah.  It's almost like the transition that stage actors go through, you know, people who do  on Broadway and they do film.  Oh, shut up.  He makes a good point, though.  Thank you, Jimmy.  As much as I'd like to spit on him, he makes a damn good point.  Pacino is doing theater acting on film.  That's why he looks so weird.  Yeah, Twitchell just did a really good job of the interview.  You are correct, too.  That's a good point.  I appreciate it.  Good job.  Thank you, John.  We might be able to develop some kind of celebrity interview thing with you as long as you're drinking Red Bull.  It could possibly be a segment.  John, we got to go.  You're doing the walk-up with us, right?  See the boss behind you, just staring?  Yeah, he's ready to pull the plug. 
[02:15:00]  Nothing wrecks a radio show than staring at your boss, staring at you, going, please end  the show.  Please, one more.  Look, guys, one more.  He's buying everything.  I got a chance for one more cheap plug?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Marine comes out this Friday in theaters everywhere.  Please go and see it a hundred times.  It'll change your life.  And it'll change yours.  Ah, yes, it will.  Marine.  And we're doing the walk-over now.  You're doing the walk-over?  We're walking to Pac-XM?  Hey, let's walk-over.  Let's go.  And are you doing the walk-over, Tricia?  Hell yeah, a walk-over, definitely.  Yeah, we're going to walk over to XM, maybe continue with John Steen.  I don't know how busy you are today.  We'd love to have you.  See how it works out.  We'll play the audio of Sting playing the loot. 
[02:15:30]  Jeff Daniels' CD now from jeffdaniels.com.  You can grab it.  And also, John Steen has filmed this October 13th, Friday the 13th.  The Marine is premiering everywhere.  Wait, someone was saying you couldn't finish your match last night.  Any story about that?  Oh, I ended up in a schmaz.  People broke it up.  It was a disqualification.  And I ended up stretching out a giant and giving the F you to a king.  Okay.  The wonderful world that is WWE.  Yeah, you've got to love it.  Fatty Pig Fatty, brought to you by H57 Hootia.  Lose weight for free at H57.com. 
[02:16:00]  We're stuck in this contest.  The heaviest girl that has walked through our studio so far is 430 pounds.  Her name's Crystal.  We're doing this contest.  $10 a pound to the fattest girl that shows up on our show there, John.  This will be great.  Well, it was great.  It'll be big.  It's going to be big.  But this girl in Cleveland, Crystal, 430 pounds, so we owe her right now $4,300.  I say money well spent, my friend.  Actually, H57.com owes her the money.  But we're hoping someone even heavier comes into the studio.  Yeah, why not?  But we're stuck at 430, unfortunately. 
[02:16:30]  I think today we break it.  And there's a finder's fee.  The person that brings in the fad, he gets $1,000 for just bringing him in.  It's not a bad gig.  So start looking for heavier fatties than 430 pounds.  All right.  If you're not joining us on XM, have a great day.  John, thank you so much.  Thank you guys for having me.  Appreciate it.  The O.P. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Outside Free FM in New York City. 
[02:17:00]  John Cena's here for the walk.  Let's not forget about the Marines.  Yeah, indeed.  Marine coming out October 13th.  Marine.  This Friday.  Friday the 13th.  Friday the 13th.  Very cool.  You want to beat someone up?  You know what?  I wouldn't mind it, but I think we should sit.  Is Twitchell still with us?  We should sit.  Is Twitchell still with us?  Because he's insane right now.  Yeah, because he could just kind of hide.  I'm looking at my picture that I took with John.  Yeah.  And it's just depressing what a non-man I am. 
[02:17:30]  You could open-handed slap me in the face.  Here's how I'd react.  Why'd you do that?  Dude, your biceps are like as big as my thigh.  I mean, I'm in the professional wrestling business, man.  I'm a sports entertainer.  We've got to be in shape.  I've been known to lift a little, though.  I mean, you know.  I'm getting to the gym, doing my bow flex.  That's crazy.  Do you do bow flex?  Every once in a while.  I need to work on my abs.  I'm trying to talk a little working out.  No, I've got to tell you. 
[02:18:00]  This is fascinating stuff.  You guys, this is part of your everyday routine.  Yeah, we just screw around.  This is fantastic.  I mean, this is just...  Oh, we do.  Sometimes we just go to Starbucks and get coffee,  and then we get to the other place when we feel like it.  But we've got some wrestling fans out here.  You want a quick autograph before we walk?  He doesn't know who we are.  He came out here for you.  Not a problem.  We'll take care of you, my man.  We got you.  A couple of wrestling fans.  They look a lot different than the Opie and Anthony fans.  Yes, they do.  They should be making chocolate with green wigs. 
[02:18:30]  All right, let's go.  Let's walk.  Roland, how did the interviews go today?  Really well.  Did Jeff Daniels like us?  It looks like he's coming in November in studio.  Oh, good.  Very nice.  Hey, I'm talking to Roland here about the interviews there.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, Jeff was happy.  Got all the plugs in.  And I was just talking with Roland as we hit the elevator.  He said he gets on radio and just freezes up.  Yeah.  Just freezes up.  Yeah, ask him a question. 
[02:19:00]  So what do you like to do in your spare time?  All right then.  Good talking to you.  No, I mean, it's great.  You're doing fine.  Concerts.  Just roll with it.  Just feel it.  It comes from inside.  Movies, concerts.  What movies do you like to see?  What's your favorite type of movie?  Action.  What movie are you going to go see this Friday?  This Friday, The Marine.  Thank you very much.  It's wonderful.  Have you heard about The Marine?  Yeah.  What are you hearing?  Good reviews.  Good reviews.  Yeah.  Action packed.  Blowing up stuff. 
[02:19:30]  Action packed.  Right.  I mean, you make it sound so great.  Seriously.  It's just fantastic.  Wow.  This is really good stuff.  Siskel and idiots.  Yes.  Yes, indeed.  All right.  Wonderful.  We personally can't get enough of the guy.  He books great guests for the show, but when we get him on mic, it's a whole different  story.  Oh, it's actually a nice day today.  Beautiful.  Quite a little crowd.  Yeah.  Then it'll get shitty tomorrow.  Hi, mister. 
[02:20:00]  So we got the governor off.  We can...  This is...  Is this XM?  Oh, now anything can fly.  Son of a bitch.  Now I can finally relax.  That's it.  There you go.  Don't have to worry about any of those nasty rules.  It might be a short walk today, because yesterday we took about an hour out here.  Yesterday was a long walk.  Jimmy bought a Playgirl.  We did all sorts of fun stuff yesterday.  My friend wrote an article on Playgirl.  And she...  Looked at a couple of hot cock magazines.  I had to buy...  Is that...  She wrote a book.  There's nothing wrong with that.  So you bought some Playgirl? 
[02:20:30]  No, I just bought one, and I had to for her article.  It really was a homo-ronic, creepy moment.  But I had to get it so I could read her article.  That was after you browsed through inches and blocked inches.  Simply for the amusement of the crowd.  Yeah, John understands, right, John?  Yeah, of course.  It's all for the entertainment, right?  All guys do that.  Just to be silly.  Good for you.  I spilled something.  You just want to see where you measure up.  Yeah, it's fucking horrifying.  All right.  Well, this is going well. 
[02:21:00]  It's just quiet.  Yesterday we had a very active walkover.  Yes, I mean...  The crowd followed us.  Certainly did.  Really seems like business as usual.  Nice day out.  You know, traffic's moving okay.  There's not a lot of people on the street.  Nobody looks.  Look at this.  Nobody looks.  There's a big star with us, and nobody even looks up.  They all get their faces burning the sidewalk.  Some people say I'm a little intimidating.  I don't know.  And there's nothing to really pick on today.  Yeah, I mean, if somebody looks at me the wrong way, I will beat the fuck out of them.  Would you?  Nice.  Yeah.  That I'd love to see.  What about this old broad right here? 
[02:21:30]  He just gave you...  Seriously, I was...  That old guy just gave you a look.  I'll slap my face off your head.  Slap.  That's right.  That old guy gave you a look.  Slap her, silly.  How great would it be to see Santa just punch a woman who's like in her 50s?  Oh.  And she just goes, oh.  Yeah.  Hits the deck.  But not a punch that would kill her.  Just one that would just like hit the side of the head and knock off her.  I'd fucking drop her, you know, in one swift shot.  I mean, she'd get up later on and everything, but, you know, I'd fucking knock her out.  When did you realize that you had like a real gift for just beating the shit out of people?  You know what?  I guess it was just after getting in a couple fights. 
[02:22:00]  Trust me, I'm not undefeated by any standards.  I've lost my fair share.  I mean, growing up, though.  Well, just by getting in fights, man.  You know how sad that was?  A guy like that is not undefeated.  No.  I grew up with five brothers, and I grew up just, you know, as a teenager and as a young guy.  I was just bouncing at bars and got into a lot of fights.  And trust me, like I said, I've had my ass handed to me on plenty of occasions.  Yeah.  But I ain't afraid to get my hands dirty and mix it up.  I haven't watched wrestling in a while.  Are there any wrestlers that you really don't like and that really do try to hurt you badly 
[02:22:30]  when they get in the ring with you?  No, I think it's weird because amidst all the entertainment, there really is a serious  sense of competition, and we all really beat the hell out of each other.  It's fun.  You've got to have a sick and twisted mind to kind of get in there and do what we do.  So it's fun.  What's your worst injury?  I got some degeneration in the disc of my neck, so that's going to be a problem long term.  But what the hell?  You know, you might as well go out and do it, right?  What, do you want to be 60 and be able to move your head? 
[02:23:00]  Who cares, right?  Exactly.  Ah, by 60, they'll have to figure out how to fix that.  Of course.  You know what?  They will.  The way science is going, it'll be great.  I'll be fine.  Flying cars.  Yeah, keep telling yourself that.  Doesn't matter if your neck works.  She'll still be getting blown.  Who cares?  There you go.  She'll know where to go.  There you go, my friend.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Oh, Jimmy Norton up on our wall.  Yeah, I heard Caroline says the wrong date for my gig.  That's fucking smart.  Damn it.  Gonna get stupid. 
[02:23:30]  Marion told me that.  We have another wrestler.  We're another wrestling fan.  Please, John, just punch him right in the throat and keep walking.  You want me to just give him a thumb to the eye?  Give him a thumb to the eye?  Are you guys John Cena fans?  Hell yeah.  Well, do you have a question for him?  We're interviewing him right here on the street.  What's up, dude?  He's the man.  The Marine's going to be great.  It wasn't exactly a question, but thank you very much, man.  I appreciate it.  You have a question for him?  How are you doing, darling?  Good for seeing your movie, Friday.  Thank you.  Oh, she's got the love in her eyes, man.  She's got the eyes for you.  Are you guys together? 
[02:24:00]  She's got love in her eyes.  Okay.  Hi.  I have a question for John Cena.  I'm a big fan.  Ask him anything.  Are you single?  I am single, available, and easy.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Yeah.  To who, sir?  Looks like a wallet.  He has nice handwriting.  It's very autograph-worthy handwriting.  Here's your opportunity.  Talk to him.  She's too busy taking the phone picture.  I don't know what they do.  Would you blow him if no one was looking? 
[02:24:30]  I'm being serious.  The cameras are off.  We can start with heavy petting and see where it goes.  All of a sudden, John just walks up the street, and we go inside.  Would you follow him and say, hey, I'd blow you?  She's not saying no.  That was a pregnant pause.  Not saying no.  You guys are great.  If the opportunity was, you know, perfect, what would you do?  Maybe just tickle the nugget back a little bit.  We'll see what happens.  All right.  Right on.  Some love in the air.  You guys are great.  I think you love connection.  It's automatic with these guys.  But more importantly, I thank you very much. 
[02:25:00]  How about somebody with John?  Would you maybe blow somebody with him just to be like a good?  Now he's on my own chair.  Like a comedian?  No, I did.  Why are you trying to throw Haterade on that stuff?  Question for John?  I got an automatic score here, and you're trying to block me.  I'm just piggybacking.  I can't cock block you.  I can only cock speed bump you.  What would you like John to do to you?  There are things I would do.  Give me a stand-up.  Oh, it's not a lie.  You can say anything.  Yeah.  Have you ever heard of a Dirty Sanchez? 
[02:25:30]  Huh?  A Dirty Sanchez?  No.  I think you're in the mode for experience.  I'm going to get you some experience.  There's a list of things that we could do.  Look forward to it.  I'm free for a couple minutes after this.  We'll explore.  Explore the boundaries.  What would you like him to do, though?  Because you like him.  You know who he is.  You enjoy his...  Huh?  What would you like him to do?  Like, honestly, what is your thing?  You have fantasy.  I'd say we had a couple minutes alone, just you and me together. 
[02:26:00]  Basically, Jim is asking if you're a size queen.  I'm not biggie.  I got it where it counts.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How much is sport in there, John?  Enough to get by.  I won't be cock speed bumping anybody.  And by the way, did you just say that looks don't count, and you're hitting on a heavyweight wrestler?  He's the hottest wrestler around.  But you just said the looks don't count.  Stand next to John, Jim.  All right, go ahead.  All right, looks don't count.  Who are you picking?  Take your choice. 
[02:26:30]  I pick him.  Oh!  The swerve!  He went with the money.  Screw all you guys.  You hook me up, and then you take it away.  You pull the rug right from under me.  Who saw that coming?  That ain't right.  That made my day.  She's just being polite.  She is being polite.  She didn't want to hurt my feelings.  I'm just kidding, huh?  Very nice.  All right.  So you'll blow him.  What do you want?  No, I just want an autograph.  All right.  That's how it all starts.  That's easy.  He's like, what the fuck did I get myself into?  It's actually, it's not gay if you blow a guy out of respect. 
[02:27:00]  No, that's gay to me.  If you're saying thank you while you do it, it's acceptable.  All the Yankees fans blow guys, not mess heads.  All right.  Hey, up top with that, brother.  That's all the way, right?  All right.  All the way, man.  All right.  Thanks for hanging with us, guys.  Tell yourselves whatever you got to tell yourself.  Hey, I'm Hugo from the Queens.  You're a Yankee fan?  I'm like in between both teams.  He's just riding a bandwagon wherever it lands.  Sure.  Boys and men. 
[02:27:30]  What is she saying?  That there'd be a mess to kick you in the nut.  Oh, you're about to get booted in the nugget pack.  I would love to see this chick beat you up.  That would be hilarious.  What'd you say?  I said the Mets are going to win this year.  What?  It's been a long time coming for the Mets.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  See, the Yankees, they had their chance.  What's going on now with them?  Wow.  See, the Yankees, they're like on the outfield now.  So now, Mets up on top.  This is the Yankees right here. 
[02:28:00]  Hi.  You want to play the window game?  Oh, the window game.  John, you want to play the window game?  Please, fill me in on the window game.  All right, this is what we do.  Watch this.  No, let John do it.  Come on.  John, you talk dirty to these girls.  Oh, they're running away.  Oh, don't run.  No, come here.  We got a big star.  Come here.  See, it looks like they can see us.  Come here.  No, look.  Look.  Look who we got.  John Cena.  We just wanted to say hi, really.  Maybe get a look at you.  It's radio.  It doesn't translate.  We just want to get a look at you.  Ugly whore in the glass is waved. 
[02:28:30]  Yes, please.  Doesn't it look like there's no window here?  Yes.  Come here.  Come here.  Look.  But there is.  See, the window's way over there.  So you could say like, hey, like I could see your bunt through your fucking blouse, you slob.  No, although you're dressed nice, I really would love you to tongue bath my brown owl.  It'd be great.  There you go.  See?  No, thanks.  I mean, thank you.  You're going right in.  It's easy.  It's all good.  No window game today, unfortunately.  Yeah, they ran.  They don't want to play.  They get all upset.  Have I told you before that sometimes I intimidate people? 
[02:29:00]  Occasionally.  I'd like to come off as a real nice guy, you know?  And sometimes people take that the wrong way.  Yeah.  Bastards.  Twitchells, one last question for John Cena.  Are you, uh...  When's the movie come out again?  October 13th.  Twitchells, you are a promotional machine.  Absolutely, man.  Go see The Marine with the one and only John Cena.  Fire the 13th, man.  Speaking of which, I will return the favor.  You are on MTV.  Is it tonight?  Yes, tonight at 10 p.m.  True Life, you have Tourette's.  Wow.  But it's True Life, I have Tourette's.  Yes, True Life, I have Tourette's.  We should be a team. 
[02:29:30]  Thank you very much.  That was a one-two punch.  I'm telling you, you've come a long way.  We were just upstairs in the elevator.  You're conducting an interview.  You have come a long way, my friend.  You are a media mogul.  Thank you, my brother.  At this point, you are a media mogul.  Absolutely.  As long as I got cocaine.  All right, listen.  Everyone else all right?  Anybody else?  Everyone's cool?  All right.  We might get these two to kick each other.  Let her kick them in the balls.  Wait.  You're going to do that?  You'll let her kick you in the balls?  You won't do it.  You won't do it.  How about just a little tap?  No, you won't do it. 
[02:30:00]  A little kick in the nuts.  Wow.  Come on, it'll be fun.  First of all, she's beautiful, so it'd be a privilege to get kicked in the nuts by a  chick this hot.  That's going to be tough call, because she got healed.  That'll be fun, though.  That'll probably leave her hurt.  How about she just kind of stomps on it a little bit?  Yeah, I mean, I'm just judging a book by its cover, but you probably don't have much  there anyway.  We're professionals.  We'll make sure this doesn't hurt that much.  Jimmy, this girl's going to stomp on this guy's balls.  I'll hold the magazines. 
[02:30:30]  This guy is looking up.  Give him a good kick to the wickets, I promise.  He's enchanting, this guy.  All right, hold on.  What are we doing?  A kick?  You ready?  Don't kick him.  Wait, wait.  Are you going to do a kick?  Dude, what's going on in your pants right there?  Wait, let me see.  He's probably got a hard-on thinking he's going to get kicks in the balls.  He does.  He's got a little something going on.  You got a little wood?  I don't know.  You're sporting a little wood there?  Do you want her to stomp on your balls or kick in the balls?  Yeah, what do you want?  It's like a light.  Are you good for a light one?  All right. 
[02:31:00]  Now, wait, wait, wait.  All right, here we go.  You've got to remember this.  Just make like he's giving you a lot of shit.  We were talking about role-playing this morning.  He's giving you a lot of shit, right?  Jimmy, mic him for us, please.  Okay.  He's giving you a lot of shit.  He throws out a racial epithet at you.  Oh, yeah.  Now you got it.  He's standing there.  Wait a minute.  Why doesn't he just do the racial epithet?  Oh, really?  Are you on a role for it like a movie scene? 
[02:31:30]  You're about to get kicked in the nuts.  Are you an actress?  I'd be a little pissed.  Are you an actress?  No, not yet.  You want to be an actress?  Yeah.  I can see how you've been an actress, so we can do a scene here.  Now, it wouldn't tell you throwing out, you know, a racial epithet.  You okay with receiving that for this part?  Oh, okay.  And you okay with saying it?  So I like to see black people.  I see things.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Black people.  Here's the line.  Here's your line.  I see Jamaican.  Let me whisper in your ear what the line is.  All right.  Say, fucking maker, bitch. 
[02:32:00]  Okay, you got it?  All right?  Oh, no.  And then you respond by going, oh, yeah?  And then, bam, kick him in the nuts.  All right.  All right?  You got your lines?  Wait, scene.  Who's got the?  I got the two magazines.  Hold on.  Wait a second.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, let's mark this.  Racial epitaph followed by kick straight to the boys' hashel.  All right?  Take one.  There you go.  Okay, you.  Hey, this guy's done a movie or something.  And action. 
[02:32:30]  No, you can't cover up like that.  You numbskull.  Wait, wait, John.  Come in here.  Take two.  Okay, you guys are the shits.  Wait till I say action.  Racial epitaph followed by swift kick to the balls.  Take two.  And no, you dummy.  He's just marking the scene.  Would you just fucking show up and actually act like what's fucking going on?  You're really bringing this production down.  Look, you don't say a word till I say action.  Really?  Where the fuck did we find this guy?  Hold on.  And you're smiling too much when you say it. 
[02:33:00]  You're angry with him.  You're angry.  Racial epitaph followed by fucking kick to the nugget bag.  Congratulations.  Take three.  All right.  Remember now you're angry.  And action.  Screw you, you nigga bitch.  I would have got him a lot better than that.  You were generous.  Shit, he's down.  You were generous.  He's down.  I mean, you put the toe right in there.  I would have got him a lot better than that.  No, he got it good, man.  Yeah, wait a minute. 
[02:33:30]  And then the follow-up for the entertainment.  She missed the line.  She didn't say, oh, yeah.  How did I feel?  We got to do it again.  You did miss your line.  We got to do it.  I've got to be the worst kick ever.  We got to do it one more time.  She didn't say, oh, yeah.  Yeah, but she missed her line.  You kind of liked it, though, didn't you?  You kind of liked it.  It was okay.  Yeah, we got to do it one more time.  One more time?  One more time.  She missed her line.  That's why.  Yeah, she missed her line.  Ladies and gentlemen, step up if you want to see a guy get kicked to the nuts.  This guy's getting kicked straight in balls.  Remember, you're angry. 
[02:34:00]  You're really angry.  And you just go, oh, yeah.  That's your line.  Oh, yeah.  And now your line, very angry.  Okay, you want to mark it?  And I'll call action.  After action.  Racial epitaph, followed by, oh, yeah.  Followed by really, really hard kick to the balls.  Take four.  And action.  Fuck you, you dirty skank.  Oh, yeah?  Not.  Now, see, that was a good one.  You got a little attitude on you.  That was a good one.  Oh, God.  Yeah, he's rolling. 
[02:34:30]  He's on the ground.  Yep.  How did that one feel?  That was a kick in the air.  Dude, but you didn't use the racial epithet.  You did.  You got to use the racial epithet.  It's acting, so it's okay.  You got to follow the script, dude.  You can't just.  Follow the script, okay?  This is an indie film.  This is the last time.  This is the take, man.  Feel it, okay?  You're angry.  You can't smile when you say it.  I mean, you're not writing your own stuff.  And you're pissed, you know.  Oh, yeah, wham.  And you give it to him.  All right? 
[02:35:00]  I just got a pretty good job.  Let's mark it.  Take three.  You got your line.  You got your line.  You got your line.  I mean, really give it to him this time.  Don't hold anything back.  I mean, I really think, from the production standpoint, you're holding a lot back.  You really got to get into it.  Okay.  Is that all right?  Okay.  Here we go.  What do you feel about sleeping with the guy who marks the picture here?  I got a chance?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll talk afterwards.  That rock.  After action.  After action.  Followed by, oh, yeah.  Followed by, just fucking kick him in the nuts.  Take five.  Okay.  All right.  And remember your lines.  Remember your motivation, your anger, and action. 
[02:35:30]  Fuck you, you nigga fancy.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, he did it.  Get him from behind.  You missed.  There you go.  Dropped the elbow or something.  You backed off.  You backed away.  Why'd you back off?  All right, let's just take it from the kick.  Yeah, we can edit the kick in.  Just from the kick.  We'll edit the kick in.  We'll edit it.  We'll fix it in post.  Just close your eyes.  No, honestly.  Just the kick.  All right.  Seriously, you got to be patient about this.  You got to stay open for it.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:36:00]  Oh, jeez.  It was a knee.  Do we need a kick?  We need him.  He's doubled over.  Oh, he's doubled over.  Yes.  That was good.  That was very good.  Yeah.  All right, and one more kick and go.  Which is, yeah, just one more kick.  One kick.  Last one.  Make it a good one.  Now stand up straight.  Don't back off.  Seriously.  One good kick.  He's got the glasses off.  Yeah, take his glasses off.  One good kick. 
[02:36:30]  No backing off now.  Just stay like that.  It won't hurt as much.  Yeah, stay just like that.  Just give him a swift pick.  Just go.  There you go.  Yeah, screw the line.  Just go.  All right.  And...  Oh!  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  I'm satisfied.  Oh, shit.  I heard that one.  I'm satisfied.  Oh, he went down.  Oh, damn.  I'm satisfied.  Wow.  God damn.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that was a good one. 
[02:37:00]  I heard that.  We don't have to do any post sound, nothing.  I heard that.  No, no.  We don't even have to...  That was great.  Fix that sound in the post.  And they're hugging.  That's perfect.  Hey, you got a camera?  You want a picture with John Cena?  We even popped twitches.  That was great.  You don't have a camera?  He was...  Thank you so much.  No camera, man?  Wow.  We'll talk after.  No camera?  Great scene.  All right.  Absolutely beautiful.  Wow.  That is a wonderful scene, man.  Fantastic.  Very good.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for being a good sport, whoever you are.  Thank you so much.  He's not even a fan of the show, by the way. 
[02:37:30]  You got a great...  You got a great kick on you.  I like that.  All right.  Nice kick.  We're going to go upstairs now.  And I think John Cena, if he doesn't make it upstairs, don't forget about the Marine.  Oh, found a friend.  Opened Friday.  The 13th.  All right.  Very cool.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Oh, that was funny, man.  That was hilarious.  All right.  We'll see you guys upstairs.  Hey, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy. 
[02:38:00]  Hey, Norton.  Yeah.  This is the guy's back at the desk.  What's that?  Missing for a day.  What happened to the guy that was working?  There was a guy working here.  Yesterday?  Yeah.  But now this is the guy that's usually here.  Where?  Right behind the desk.  Everyone see him?  He's right in front of you.  You see him?  I just see a ballless scrotum that somebody threw a tie on.  A bleeding ballless scrotum that somebody accidentally dropped a tie on.  I wonder why people always are putting ties on these disgusting items. 
[02:38:30]  How did somebody remove the testes from the scrotum and keep it bleeding and then drop a tie  on it?  Why would they do that?  Now, be nice.  I'm going to be nice.  All right.  You be nice.  Okay.  Hello, sir.  Good morning.  Good morning, sir.  How are you today?  This is a fine day.  Another good day.  Killed on Christmas Eve.  I hope you die on Christmas Eve.  See you upstairs.  All right.  No more on the elevator.  Look at how packed on it. 
[02:39:00]  That's five stories.  Well, I didn't want to pack on that other day.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would  believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:39:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of town hall PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[02:40:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get it.  guitar solo 
[02:40:30]  guitar solo 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, you can turn that on. 
[02:41:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm making everybody wait as I punch up pal talk.  Wow, that was a hell of a walkover right at the end there.  Goddamn, that last kick made that thud that is only made when a woman's shoe hits a man's ball sack.  Wow, direct.  It seemed like just an everyday day on the street.  Yeah.  We find a hot chick.  You guys score me some oral sex after this, which is pretty good.  Yeah, see?  I thank you for that. 
[02:42:00]  Hook you up.  And on top of that, the chick who's going to perform oral sex just takes a random dude on the street, kicks him stiff, stiff in the balls.  Multiple times.  And the last one being just the best shot.  Is it opiananthony.com?  This will be on opiananthony.com?  And YouTube and all that.  YouTube.  This will be all over YouTube.  Oh, yeah.  Foundry music.com.  This will go all over.  People love watching people get kicked in the nuts.  And coming from the school of where I see kicks to the nuts every day, this one was a good one.  True.  This is one you've got to see.  Took a few takes, but that happens sometimes. 
[02:42:30]  But it's all right.  And that last one.  The last one we got the magic.  Boom.  What was great about that?  That guy was just a wrestling fan.  He just wanted a lousy autograph from John Cena.  He doesn't know who we are, what we do.  No, no.  He had no clue.  And for his troubles.  He read it on a wrestling site somewhere that you were going to be on the show.  And that's it.  I don't know if I gave him an autograph.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I don't think we got a payoff for him.  I just think he got kicked in the nuts.  For his troubles.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks for showing up.  He was four kicks to the nuts.  Yeah.  Thanks for being here.  Yeah.  Well, let's say hi to Mark in Glendale. 
[02:43:00]  Mark, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Great walkover today.  John, just to let you know, the phrase is racial epithet, not racial epitaph.  Oh, sorry.  It's my first day on the job.  I'm really trying to get all the finance stuff.  No problem.  Good luck with the movie this weekend.  I thank you, sir.  Yeah.  Take it easy.  We're going to all check out the Marine Friday.  Let's see.  What is this about?  Skipper, Kentucky.  What's up?  Hey, boys.  The virus is spreading.  I'm telling you, man.  Bill O'Reilly gave you a little bit of a mention on the radio factor yesterday. 
[02:43:30]  The radio factor?  The radio factor.  Yeah.  Not the TV show.  The radio factor.  Right.  What did he say?  What did he say?  They were talking about Kim Jong-il and this Korea nuclear thing or whatever, and there's  something about America.  You know, they're not listening anymore, and they don't care because they're probably listening  to something like Opie and Anthony.  Oh, well.  Yeah, that's it.  Well, Bill.  Jeez.  That's it.  Too bad we're not fucking hitting on a producer with a fucking hard cock and a loofah sponge,  you jizz pocket.  Bill O'Reilly should be shot.  I like your style.  Oh, he's a freak.  No, no, seriously, I like him. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's all right with me.  Bill O'Reilly?  No, no, no, no, no.  Me?  Yeah.  Oh, you like Jimmy?  Yeah, the whole time he's been over here.  Jimmy's great.  Yeah.  Who doesn't?  I like your style.  I thought you liked Bill O'Reilly.  I'm like, what?  No, no.  He needs to clean it up.  But in other news, I got beef with North Korea.  I mean, I got some fucking beef with North Korea.  The testing thing was big, but I finally, after long last, I mean, I've been doing this  wrestling gig for about five years now, getting my ass whipped, I finally make it to Regis. 
[02:44:30]  I mean, it was big.  I mean, Regis was fired up, everything was going on, and I got preempted for the damn North Korea.  Oh, are you kidding?  Because they blew up their A-bomb or whatever.  So I got legitimate fucking heat with North Korea.  Yep.  I mean, I'm damn near.  God, say that.  They got bumped.  Yeah.  Because of their piddly shit atomic bomb.  I'm about one strawberry quick away from going over there and whipping ass myself on everybody.  Just crossing the line and not stopping.  Yep.  You know?  Do it.  Single-handed.  I'm going to push them back single-handed.  Imagine that.  Yeah.  Problem solved.  Yeah.  I wonder how far I'd get.  Probably six feet.  With their shitty atomic bomb. 
[02:45:00]  Huge.  I dare them.  Exactly.  Drop it.  Go ahead.  Bring it here.  We'll let you bring it over because you don't have a missile.  We were doing that in the 50s.  Yeah.  Can you imagine the weaponry we have now?  We were doing that in the 50s.  Stop it.  Can you imagine this?  When your A-bomb says, place on ground, light fuse, get away.  You know it's a suck-ass atom bomb.  Acme atomic bomb.  Can you imagine the weapons we have that we want to test that we just know we can't?  You can't even test it because it would fuck up shit so bad.  You can't even test it.  I would fuck up the Milky Way. 
[02:45:30]  Our bombs have tits now and they just knock on your door.  They start to suck your dick and you go, oh wow, and they blow up.  Yeah.  Our bombs are great.  Yeah.  Hey, the Marine.  Yeah.  Are you more like Rambo?  No, to be honest.  Are you more like doing your own thing?  If we were to rip off any film, I would say it's Commando.  Commando.  But instead of Schwarzenegger's daughter getting stolen, my wife gets stolen.  What was his name in that one?  John Miller?  Hi, my name is Frank. 
[02:46:00]  My name is Frank Wilson.  What the fuck?  How come they give names like that all the time?  I think it's just aggressive.  My name is Bradley Johnson.  What?  No, it would be Harshtefargen Warshtefurgen.  Yeah, but that sounds good.  Bradley Johnson, when Schwartz says it, sounds really gross.  It's a good American name.  Exactly.  It sounds like this.  My name is Joseph Gimbel.  Is it?  It's impossible.  What's your name in the movie?  John Triton.  I'm John Triton.  See, even that sounds good. 
[02:46:30]  John Triton.  Yeah.  It's a very manly name.  That's just the Schwartz test.  Good for the action movie.  That's a good name, though, man.  I never get kicking ass.  I never get changing names for some flex.  Why not just John Cena?  Well, I figured that, and that would be the natural fit, but a lot of fans, honestly,  they see Monday Night Raw, and they see John Cena as John Cena.  And this is half of John Cena.  It's John Triton.  Now, what's your character on WWE these days?  It's pretty much me, man.  You're not doing the rap thing anymore, weren't you? 
[02:47:00]  No, no.  The rap character?  That was a good way to establish me on WWE, but at the same time, that's like...  I'm embarrassed to say it, and I used to be huge into it.  No, I know, and you guys fell off.  Well, they...  But does that mean we fell off?  No, no, no.  No, no.  We still love you guys, and we have you in all the time, but I don't know.  The PC world got a hold of wrestling for a while, but I'll be honest with you.  I'm starting to take more and more peeks, because it seems like they're going back to getting  a little crazy.  Yeah, a little bit.  Because it was getting insane to watch. 
[02:47:30]  It was so funny.  When What's-Her-Name was having a baby and just all the crazy...  I believe Mae Young gave birth to a hand.  Mae Young gave birth to a hand.  I'm like, yes!  Now, that was some fucking storylines.  The storylines and the writing was so freaking funny, man, and over the top.  I can only imagine the writing meetings where, like, anything went.  How about we just knock up this old bitch and have her give birth to a hand?  Matt, you sold me on it.  We'll do it.  I was watching the other day, and Triple H is outside the dressing room door, making 
[02:48:00]  believe the dude inside was jacking off the black announcer.  I forget his name.  That's funny.  Yeah.  I forget his name.  Coach.  Coach.  We've had Coach on the show, too.  And that was funny.  I'm like, wait a minute.  Maybe they're going back to some crazy stuff again.  They're going back to a little bit of something for everybody.  We've got the old hijinks and the new stuff.  Because I'm going to sit here and fake it.  There was a period there.  I was like, I can't watch this anymore.  And I was like, I could not miss an episode.  But to be honest with you, we did get hit extremely hard by the censors.  Yeah.  It unbelievably led to me not being able to rap anymore. 
[02:48:30]  Because I would try to go out there and push the envelope with what I said.  Right.  Yeah.  Pretty much you can't say anything.  How frustrating is that?  It's the shits.  Because, I mean, you want to go out and be as funny as you can and as entertaining as  you can and even try to walk the line between, you know, it'd be as racist.  We're on at 9 o'clock, 9 to 11.  Right.  And we can push the envelope.  We're up against shows like Nip Tuck, you know, The Shield, Sopranos.  Nip Tuck has Rosie O'Donnell getting banged.  They're doing a lot of stuff over there.  That's a lot worse than what you guys do.  How are we getting the microscope?  Did you see the preview of that? 
[02:49:00]  She's playing a dame or someone help me out.  I saw the commercial or a preview on one of the gossip shows and she's laying there in  some like hot, quote, hot, it's a hot outfit on anyone else and some dude is banging her.  I don't know if she's a hooker or she's banging the doctor to get the surgery for free.  There's some weird storyline.  But there's Rosie O'Donnell making sex faces.  That's horrible.  On Nip and Tuck.  No, I don't want to say that.  Don't want to say that.  Nip Tuck, whatever, yeah.  What do you think, besides your movie, of course, was one of the best wrestlers in 
[02:49:30]  a movie, movies?  Man, I just...  There have been a few.  I liked Hulk Hogan.  Rundown.  Rock with the Rundown.  The Rock, I liked The Rock.  I liked The Rock in Scorpion King.  Yeah.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Yeah.  But nothing, nothing until I see your movie, sir.  Don't want to...  Don't want to...  Don't want to get into any trouble with you, my friend. 
[02:50:00]  No, no, it's all right.  Rowdy Roddy Piper.  They live.  They live.  That fucking movie is great.  They live.  No, I don't know that movie.  Oh.  I have a better one.  It's got a cool story to it.  One of the best fucking fight scenes in a movie where there's a wrestler involved.  Because you know you're going to see some moves.  You're going to see some of the moves.  Sure.  But this fight went on forever and it got funny and just...  That movie I thought was very well done.  Yeah.  John Carpenter, I think, did that.  Yeah.  But believe it or not, Roddy Piper was on our program last night and he still gets fired 
[02:50:30]  up about that.  Yeah.  I mean, it's one of those movies...  It just came on maybe last week.  It was on one of the movie channels.  Yeah.  Boom.  You got...  It's one of those movies you got to stop and watch it.  Yeah.  Did you ever see The Postman Always Rings Twice with Chief J Strongbow?  I did.  I did not catch that.  I was watching...  I said it the other day on the walkover.  I saw Chief J Strongbow wrestling the other night on...  I think it was Madison's...  Madison Square Garden Classics.  Yeah.  It's great.  Yeah.  All those old wrestling matches, man.  Yeah.  Some great, great stuff. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, the classics.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Andre and Johnny wrestling like three guys at one time.  Yeah.  It's a different game.  They're all under like six foot tall so they look like midgets compared to him.  He would stack them up and then sit on top of them.  Yeah.  Oh, the old school stuff I love.  I named my cock after a midget wrestler when I was a kid, Coconut Willie.  There was a fucking wrestler named Coconut Willie.  And I named my cock Coconut Willie just to be a silly goose and the name stuck.  I go way back with the wrestling.  We talk about this every once in a while.  There was a... 
[02:51:30]  I forgot his name.  I mean, the wrestling geeks out there would know.  But one of the wrestlers, he would lose his mind so bad in the ring, they would actually  take masking tape and make an X over the camera.  Oh, I used to hate that.  Because they're like, oh my God, we can't show them.  Every time the guys would get busted open, too.  Every time on their national broadcast, every time they would get busted open.  I forgot what this guy's name was.  They put the X there and I'd try to...  No, but this...  I'd try to be looking around it to see some blood.  Yeah.  John Carr?  Yeah, right. 
[02:52:00]  But it was masking tape and they made an X right over the camera.  And then the action was in the middle of the action.  Like, we can't show you.  Oh my God.  I forgot his name, though.  I know it's true.  Yeah, that's gone back a ways, man.  We got Rosie Nip Tuck Info.  Tom, Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey, Tom.  Nice talking to you.  John?  Hey, yeah, what happened was Rosie won the lottery and she bought her husband a bigger  dick and bought her daughter some tits.  And then the daughter and the husband, which was her stepfather, ended up banging in the 
[02:52:30]  bed.  And she saw it and so family over and so she paid Christian to have sex with her.  How come...  She gets her husband, who's the stepfather of the daughter, a bigger dick and gets the  daughter tits.  What the fuck does she think's going to happen?  Well, Nip Tuck sounds like a great show.  By the way, the video was on YouTube and now we found it and says the video no longer  available, unfortunately.  Yeah, a little copyright infringement.  Oh, well.  You snap too and you see the daughter, you know, riding her husband and then, yeah, family 
[02:53:00]  over.  All right.  You're going to be seeing a lot of copywritten shit being removed a lot quicker on YouTube.  Well, Google bought it.  By Google.  Also, they're talking about making deals with a lot of the record companies.  If a video is up there that contains a song, you know, a lot of people put videos up there,  they put a song, soundtracks behind it, you will now be either removed or billed by the  record companies for the music that you're putting on there.  Now we're going to wreck YouTube.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  That's unbelievable, man.  It went corporate so quickly.  It's done.  Something else will pop up in its place.  It always does.  That's what's great about the internet.  But I don't know how many cool fucking Iraqi videos you could watch with just sick fucking  music behind it.  Yeah.  You know, just the choppers coming in, chewing up some convoy to music.  That'll be gone because the music's copywritten.  Go to Ogre.  Hear the original music they play.  That fucking awful Arabic nonsense they listen to. 
[02:54:00]  They have the original soundtracks, no copyright at all.  It goes to the head.  Next video.  Savages.  They're saying John's got to go, but a couple things really, really fast.  We've got Steve from New York City.  The wrestler who they censored all the time was Blackjack Mulligan.  Blackjack Mulligan.  Blackjack Mulligan.  It's Steve.  When he gave the claw on the face, they put the big black X over the screen.  That's right.  So you couldn't see it.  That's right.  It's funny.  And people want us to try to get a spoiler out of you there, John.  You got anything?  They're saying you're joining DX, huh?  No, no.  As a matter of fact, I'm not right now. 
[02:54:30]  Last night was a champion of champions match.  It was just announced for Cyber Sunday.  I believe it's November 5th.  You're going to have myself, if I can hold on to the WWE title, versus the world champion,  King Booker T, versus the ECW champion, The Big Show.  So for the first time ever in the history of sports entertainment, all three of the  respective champions will be in the ring at the same time, fighting to see who's the  best.  Well, give us something.  Fighting to see who's the best.  Give us something, because when the wrestlers are on and they give us a little something,  the next thing you know, we're on every wrestling show.  Come on, I appreciate it.  Give us something.  You're at a weird time for us. 
[02:55:00]  We just kind of had an end-all, be-all pay-per-view, Unforgiven, and SmackDown had their No Mercy  pay-per-view, so we're like at a new slate right now.  Everybody's kind of starting over.  Admit like you're into plushies or something.  Plushies.  Or you like to play the loot.  You know what?  I'd like to watch Sting play in the loot.  Who wouldn't?  As I'm dressed as a plushie.  Yeah, that works.  Who wouldn't?  What are the rumors about that a classy Freddie Blassie will be managing again?  They've been hot on the line.  Well, first of all, they would have to dig him up. 
[02:55:30]  Is he dead?  He is, right?  Of course he is.  Unfortunately, he is dead.  I didn't know that.  I'll tell you what.  You know what?  I'll give you a halfway decent spoiler.  For those who don't know, something that may get you under the sights.  My father, believe it or not, got into the wrestling business after I did.  His name is also John Cena.  He wrestles on every independent circuit in New England by the name of John Fabulous.  And we've got him on the WWE program.  He, Edge, busted into my old man's house and slapped him in the face.  He did so well that you may possibly see Johnny Fabulous creating his own stable. 
[02:56:00]  I told you, Johnny Fabulous.  He is 62.  Wow.  And he's wrestling.  He is.  He's a manager.  Well, yeah, okay.  But they get in there.  Yeah, they get into the action.  But he's already printed his own money, otherwise known as Fabo Bucks.  He hands out his own money.  He's got his own t-shirts and everything.  So he's ready for the call-up.  For the big time.  I love the gimmicks, man.  And Vince, believe it or not, Vince was impressed.  And what better way to go than father and son, both with the same name.  Over the years, they've tried to get us involved in a match or something.  We're like, oh, no way.  You got choked out once so quickly in a parking lot. 
[02:56:30]  Really bad.  And I think I fractured something in the front of my neck.  Well, here's the thing.  What was his name?  Stevie Richardson.  Yeah, Stevie Richardson.  Oh, look at that.  The video is classic.  I look like a rag doll.  And I mean, I forgot what I said, but I said the wrong thing.  And he choked me out.  Stevie's not one of the bigger guys.  Well, one of the little guys choked you out.  Sorry.  I'm not going to show you.  And one of the small guys, 6'4", 220, choked me out or whatever he is. 
[02:57:00]  Well, the wrestling won't take my character.  I had a good one, actually, where I was going to be.  I mean, I'm not in wrestling shape, but I could get there.  It was going to be me in like those old, like the classic wrestler outfits with the straps,  the chest straps.  Right.  Like they wear in regular high school wrestling.  Yes, but the back was going to be cut out.  And then at the end of every match, Chyna would rape me with her clits.  I just don't know if we could get away with that.  I just don't know if we could show that.  Put up the red X.  We can't show it.  It's insane.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  This is horrible. 
[02:57:30]  Hey, before we go, we're just having a good time with you, John.  Where do you have to go next?  I have no idea.  You're lying.  He's on a tour, man.  He's on a publicity tour.  I wonder if we should.  Hey, honestly, how about Twitchels?  He is in the zone right now.  Yeah, bring Twitchels in before you go.  Oh, is he in the zone?  She's just bored.  She doesn't want to be here anymore.  Is she your publicist or something?  Oh, which one?  The blog girl.  Yes, she is.  She is.  Very lovely.  Are we doing good, though? 
[02:58:00]  Thumbs up.  The Marine, right?  Yeah, of course.  It's Friday.  Opening Friday wide.  I thank you again for the cheap plug.  As Roland would say.  Thank you.  Shwoogie.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, best wrestling show on TV.  I don't know if you guys see it.  It's a wrestling classic show.  It's on MSG.  We were just talking about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I missed it.  I missed that.  Hey, John, I can ask you a question, man.  You seem to be a little bit more old school.  I just remember back in the day, maybe it was because I was embarked, but it just seems  things were so much more planned out.  Like, I remember the Bruno, Larry, Larry Zabisco thing. 
[02:58:30]  That buildup took place over the course of a month.  Yeah, but you've got to realize that back then they had maybe one syndicated television show  a month, possibly one every two months.  So you'd work to, you know...  Sure, I understand that.  But now it just seems so rushed.  I mean, I've got to be honest.  Oh, and I will tell you, I used to be into this so much more.  Now I hardly even watch it.  It's just not a slight against anyone.  It's just not interesting.  Brother, it's just...  I mean, it's the same thing, month after month.  I mean, Vince took ECW, and you know, you have Coke. 
[02:59:00]  Coke has Sprite, so forth and so on.  But they also have typical other type of beverages.  Like Diet Coke.  Or Coke with lemon.  What about Vanilla Coke?  I'm talking about they have like Minute Mead.  Diet Vanilla Coke?  My point is...  Cherry Coke?  Vince buys things.  And he makes it...  The new Coke.  That didn't last while, though.  ...WWE.  No.  And it becomes a little ridiculous.  Coca-Cola Classic.  Coke in the black can.  Why not make ECW...  Coke?  RC Cola.  RC Cola?  Yeah. 
[02:59:30]  Shrug.  7-Up.  7-Up.  There you go.  Join him.  Yeah.  My point is, if you buy something...  Like you have ECW, why not keep that as a separate, sustained brand?  Why water it down by bringing in the WWF people?  You know, he did that with the WCW.  I mean, it has some different types of branding.  First of all, both of those brands did go out of business.  So there's probably a reason why they didn't succeed.  Vince talk...  Look, you know as well as I do, Vince practices revisionist history.  Yes, WCW was a colossal failure. 
[03:00:00]  Burned through $85 million its last year.  And you're saying we should stick with that?  Over the last three years.  What are you saying?  You're saying we should have stuck with that?  No, no, I'm not saying that.  Okay, because I don't know how good that would be for the books.  But Vince comes out, Vince loses $115 million one year in the XFL.  No, so, you know...  And he's on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it!  Crawl around like a dog!  What I'm saying is...  And he should get it.  Rightfully so.  It was a waste of time.  Have something different.  That's everything I'm saying.  All right, truck.  Everything is still the same.  You're fire!  You're fire! 
[03:00:30]  Straight from the boss.  I love that.  Let's end with...  Fire!  D-Day from South Carolina.  What's up?  How you doing?  Hi.  You're going to Cold Pizza next, they're saying.  Cold Pizza?  What time?  Cold Pizza?  10.30?  Not you.  I don't know.  We really do have to get to that.  Okay, okay, okay.  All right, D-Day, we end with you.  What's up?  I'm at John Cena once in a gym in Danbury.  Let me tell you, that was like...  I felt like Jimmy Norton.  I hated myself so much.  I'm working out and I look up in the mirror and nothing makes you feel fatter and smaller 
[03:01:00]  than seeing the WWE champion working out behind you.  Yeah, I walked up to him.  He's been working out for...  He's got to be working out in five years now.  He's been...  The guy's been in the gym.  Eh, could be longer than that, Jimmy.  I was more than that, Jim.  D-Day.  Yeah, I was...  So I walked up to him and I said hello.  And then I did the old Chris Farley.  I walked away and I'm like, stupid, stupid.  I shouldn't have said anything for him.  I quit this guy's spot.  And then, of course, you know, I couldn't leave it alone.  I had to go up and apologize for saying hello to him.  Oh, one of those guys. 
[03:01:30]  Keeps coming back.  Yeah.  I'm really sorry for saying that.  I love keep coming back, guy.  It's like, all right, man.  Just glad to meet you.  Don't want to bother you, though, anymore.  I see you having fun.  You do your thing.  Do your thing.  Do your thing.  And then they leave.  And then, like, two minutes later...  God, I'm sorry for coming back and saying that.  I really am.  I got to come back.  But I got to ask you this one thing.  All right.  Look, have a good night.  Take it easy, man.  And then they leave.  And then...  Dude, could you just, like, maybe sign...  I hate to...  Call my friend.  He's on the phone here.  Who did you say hi?  He's like, son of a bitch.  You got to smell their bad phone...  I didn't even... 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Greasy earpiece.  I was so embarrassed by even saying anything to him.  I was just like, sorry, dude.  No, man.  You know what?  That doesn't go down in the annals of the most embarrassing moments of my life, so I think  you did all right.  D-Day, you held your own, damn it.  Say he didn't remember it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  If you want to pull that jacock, that would have made it weird.  John, you're a great guest, by the way.  Oh, guys, you know what?  This is awesome.  We got Twitchels here.  Honestly, it's a modern-day phenomenon.  I couldn't have put it better myself.  Thank you.  You're the man, John. 
[03:02:30]  And Twitchels, you did a great job interviewing him.  I appreciate that.  I'll say that again.  I am tough on your time.  Before the corporate claws come crashing down, check out the Kick to the Nuts on YouTube.  Hey, there you go.  Oh, yeah.  Because that was a swift kick to the nuts.  You don't see stuff like that every day.  No.  I'm going to want to relive that over and over again.  And please, can I get one last cheap plug-in?  Please.  The Marine.  It comes out this Friday, October 13th.  Possibly the greatest piece of cinema ever captured on film.  The preview looked really good.  Action.  It's a lot of action, a little bit of comedy, and a little bit of romance for the ladies. 
[03:03:00]  We get to see the serious side of John Cena.  Exactly.  A.K.A. John Triton.  All emotional.  My name is John Triton.  I'm John Triton.  Kicky-ass single-handed.  You got freestyle rapping you as you leave?  You know what?  I would.  Oh, but honestly.  Cold pizza, right?  You're blaming cold pizza?  Yeah, I'm blaming cold pizza.  I'm blaming.  And I'll be honest with you.  There's a girl out there who promised to give me a little bit of romance.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So I made the freestyle rap, oral satisfaction.  You're a busy man. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  But seriously, guys, thank you very much for having me.  It's been great.  I hope you've done it.  Thank you.  John Cena, everyone.  Great job.  Definitely.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Now walk out awkwardly.  There they go.  All right.  Later.  Off to a cold pizza.  It was very happy.  Cold pizza.  It'll be good.  Say goodbye to the young lady.  Maybe she's going with him.  There you go.  Take it.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  Please go on a cold pizza with John Cena.  I was hoping to hit on her, but I guess I can't compete with John Cena. 
[03:04:00]  He rules.  Why don't you go out there, Jimmy?  Could you misphrase me?  Kick John Cena's ass, Jimmy.  Take that girl from him.  Go ahead.  Do it.  All right.  We're going to work on Tourette's Day with Twitchell's lead in the way.  That's really cool.  Thank you, man.  Drag her by the throat.  Get Steve to get a Tourette's Day promo together.  Maybe Twitchell's could voice it.  Sure, I'd love to.  All right.  Tourette's Day coming to the O.P. and Anthony's show soon.  We'll break. 
[03:04:30]  Okay.  I'm drinking my smoothie.  Guess what?  I didn't even ask for it today.  We got Sting on the Today Show.  Oh, thank God.  Because we're obsessed with the loot.  I want to hear him and his stupid loot.  And we already forgot, but the boys behind the scenes did not.  We got the Troggs taped.  Oh, fuck.  Behind the scenes in the studio.  The Troggs studio audio.  Bitching each other out.  Yeah.  Supposedly it's great.  Is it great?  Very Spinal Tap-esque is the review.  Yeah, but this was before Spinal Tap. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  Kind of inspired that moment.  Andy Summers turned us...  I can't talk.  Andy Summers turned us on to this yesterday.  Very good.  And we got it today, and we'll do that hopefully next.  The virus is ready.  The virus is inside us.  OEvirus.com.  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just pests.

[03:25:30]  about his experience  with the full service  dominatrix  there were references  to her having a strap on  and although it was never said  there were references  to her wanting  to use it on him  he said he didn't enjoy  the sensation  in that area  unless there's a fist  attached to it  this made the fisting  reference clear  wow  8 degrees of separation  between the fist  and the asshole though  exactly  come on now  all kinds of stuff  guy likes a good fist

[03:29:00]  Christ  that I  did not  have to be  part of  I the last  thing I wanted  to say  was Sting  playing  the loot  I'm getting  a lot of  shrugged  shoulders  they hated  it  it's stunk  ass  you don't  gotta  oh don't  don't lie  they hated  it  they're too  scared  Sting  stunk  they're scared  because XM  presented the  it was  it doesn't matter  that XM  presented it  XM presented  Sting  you don't think 
[03:29:30]  everyone at XM  even the people  that got Sting  wanted  would have  rather had him  do police  songs  I don't think  it stunk  stunk  no his voice  sounded good  I just didn't  like the style  you were singing  like if you  like that style  for whatever reason  like if you  own a slave  and that's the  style of music  you enjoy  you'll love  this CD  really  yeah yeah  I mean  I'm sure he  did it justice  it's an endorsement  yeah  Jimmy's endorsing it  they hated it  it was horrible  you could see it on their  faces  a bore fest 
[03:30:00]  he wanted more  police songs  let's sit there  yeah he should have  done some more  like Roxanne  without the loot  did we say that  he had a songbook  did I say this  on the first half  of the show  this is a songbook  and he's like  flipping the pages  every time it's time  for a new song  yeah  and I lean over  to Eric Logan  I go  that last page  better say Roxanne  in big letters  Roxanne  so everyone can see it  they're all applauding  on that one  they didn't say Roxanne  well here's Sting  on the Today Show  trying to explain 
[03:30:30]  what the hell  he's doing  right  give it  good luck  Sting is reaching  into the past  for inspiration  but this time  it's the distant  distant past  his new album  released today  is made up  of entirely  Elizabethan songs  in the late 1500s  it's called  Songs from the Labyrinth  and Sting is here  along with  Edin Karamazov  his fellow musician  on the album  good morning  to both of you  good morning  this is the music  of John Dowland  who wrote  flow my tears  we think  flow my tears 
[03:31:00]  fall from your springs  excite forever  let me mourn  where night's blackbird  hear her sad infamy  sings  let me live forlorn  is it the word  sting  or the music  that you say  has haunted you  for 20 years  I think it's both  I mean they're both  tailor made for each other  there's a wonderful  sad melancholy  beauty about them  that's very captivating  it's certainly  drawn me to the same  listen to the words  dude this guy's  a fucking pompous  douchebag  I'm sorry  you're pissing off 
[03:31:30]  the sting fans  no there aren't  any sting fans  no sting fans  out there  dude did you  say it right to  the girl in the  Detroit Tigers  hat  I'll say it  I'll say it  I will say it  to you  I will apologize  to every sting fan  if you  play back  the lyric  you tell me  what the fuck  it even means  and I will  apologize  to everybody  about sting  tell me  what that meant  tell me  tell me 
[03:32:00]  alright hold on  tell  what  what do you mean  how do you know  Jim  it's gotta be  over there  I timed it out  yesterday  alright  who wrote  flow my tears  we think  flow my tears  fall from your springs  exile forever  let me mourn  where night's blackbird  hear her sad infamy  sings  let me live  forlorn  alright  stop it  stop it right there  what the fuck  she's got some tears  yeah  I got that part  it was the first line  they're flowing  stupid poetry 
[03:32:30]  yet  there might be  a stoppage  no  wrong  bam  night  what am I going to  take your word for it  night on a dog  like this  night on a dog  Alice  you got no sense  of humor  it basically means  the other two guys  are fucked  is that  yeah that's what it meant  the guitarist  that was the tears  oh I don't know  what do you think  of the rest of the  members of police  the police  and then he's talking 
[03:33:00]  about well it's  Paul  has haunted him  for 20 years  this motherfucker  has haunted him  for 20 years  really when you're  doing tantric  tantric sex  and fucking  yeah  with Trudy  with his wife  Trudy  is she sexy as  wife  yeah  from what I saw  I don't think  they're  neither of them  are kids anymore  but  you know  I don't understand  that  okay  so let's continue  alright  more from Sting 
[03:33:30]  I shan't apologize  because no one  could tell me  what the hell  that meant  and his co-performer  I know that you  taught Sting  to play  some of  John Dowland's music  and you know  he's a very  accomplished musician  how is he  he's a teacher  and he's a student  but this is more  like we're  inspiring each other  just working together  and most of all  just trying to  believe in the music  of John Dowling  which is so beautiful 
[03:34:00]  the music is a  window to the soul  so you're really  connecting  this is the music  it's self-reflective  yeah  oh  das Sting  ist gut  yeah  love das Stingen  oh  das gut Sting  ja  ja  da  da  da  da  da  proxen  da  da  oh  das gut Sting  well we got  translations coming in  of course  translations  yeah  Abel I guess 
[03:34:30]  from Harlem  mhm  don't make fun of  folk music  I like Elizabethan  and Jacobin  music  Elizabethan  Elizabethan  and now he translates  flow my tears  far from your spring  translation  the guy has lost  his chick  he has no access  to her pussy anymore  oh is that it  and he is mourning  are they laughing out there  I can't look now  no  good Sam 
[03:35:00]  they're uncomfortable  shaking their heads  they're uncomfortable  and looking around  oh no  picked the wrong day  to bring in the  you know  you write down  don't stand so close to me  write down the words  I know exactly what that's about  that's right  you  there's a  teacher  and uh  nothing  no  alright  uh  wants to bang  his student  that's it  alright let's uh  let's listen to the other guy again  or the student wants to bang  the teacher  oh either way  it's hot  we're getting back  that's all it matters  this song not hot 
[03:35:30]  loot  never hot  opiates  uh  why Dave  why  what did I do to you  well  first of all  you are so hip for the room  with all these great guys  you like  but you always give Jimmy shit  about Kiss  and Ozzy Osbourne  granted Paul Stanley  did the Phantom of the Opera  but he made all claims  it was just for the play  it wasn't  you know  fucking rock and roll all night  or take me  gonna be sung  it was  Phantom of the Opera  you and Ron  are the worst ones about it 
[03:36:00]  you give these  the basic rock and rollers  a bunch of shit  for not being talented  but they're not pompous  like Sting  or Led Zepp  one that  you and Ronnie  are in good company  wait opi is  I'm pompous about the music  I don't get your point  no well  well maybe it's more  but you always  like Led Zeppelin  remember  about 10 years ago  Jimmy Page  and Robert Plant  got back together  everybody was wanting  to see the  you know  the big reunion thing  and they did just  a bunch of  honestly  it was a disaster 
[03:36:30]  and I used to do it  we goofed on that  whole thing too  with the flute  and the guy  with the  some Indian guy  with a log  and I used to do  an old bit  you know  when it was really  timely  when  what was it called  there was Page and Plant  they were like  experimenting with  they were singing  the old Zeppelin songs  but using all these  new instruments  I forget exactly  maybe we could get  a sample  I'm just giving you shit  hold on  I would sing to Lee  like  if the sun  refused  to shine  and mountains 
[03:37:00]  crumble  into the sea  I completely agree  it was just awful  it was ridiculous  play the friggin song  but it was all these  Indian like  all right  here's  Sting's co-performer  I know that you 
[03:37:30]  taught Sting  to play  some of  John Dowland's music  and you know  he's a very accomplished musician  how is he as a teacher  and as a student  but this is more  like we are  inspiring each other  just working together  and most of all  just trying to  to live in the music  of John Dowland  it's so beautiful  music is a window  to a soul  so you're really  connecting  this is the music  of self-reflection  really  we need more of 
[03:38:00]  these days  do we  and so on that note  self-reflection  let me then  let introduce you  singing  or playing actually  come again  thank you  so does the businessman  get off the hook  in the end  uh no  it ruins his life  completely  or does he have to live  it's gotta  in order  or does he go home  living with  everyday wondering  when  it's gonna be up  when they finally  find him out  he's a dope  the business  he doesn't know  how to get out  of that mess  he calls 911  he panics  yeah  he has to go to jail 
[03:38:30]  there's a couple  yeah  and he's got  the bunny head  the head of the bunny  costume is tilted back  but it's attached  to the costume  so it's hanging  behind him  I kinda like  Obi's take on this  though  there's a couple  of ways it could go  he does such a poor  job of getting rid  of her  that they know  he did it  and they're just  collecting enough  evidence  so everyday  it's just a nightmare  for him  when he's home  he can't  like  his wife is going  it's something  no  no  nothing  it's like  worse  that he didn't  get caught

[03:41:00]  shaking their head  no one's brave  out there  no one was  it's not the police  it's not solo  Sting  alright here we go  Sting performing  with the lute  it's a Christmas song  who will bid a shilling 
[03:41:30]  for this negro  come again  that I may cease  to mourn  through the unkindest shame 
[03:42:00]  for now I've come  forlorn  I sit  I sigh  I weep  I faint  I die  in deadly pain  and endless  is the one  I sit  I sigh  I weep  I faint  I die  in deadly pain  and endless  is the one 
[03:42:30]  of the day  the sun  that lends me shine  my flowers  do cause me  excuse me  but I do believe  that's the pain  the reason you  is too late  the smiles  my swings  that makes  my joys  to grow  hello exactly  the frows  the winters  stop whining  stop it  stop it  quiet 
[03:43:00]  the smiles  stop it  that makes  my joys  to grow  this sucks  the frows  the winters  of my room  all night  my sleeps  are full  of dreams  what  my eyes  are full  of dreams  god damn it  are you fucking  with me  that's terrible 
[03:43:30]  I'm sorry  no no no no  no no  all right 
[03:44:00]  that's gonna be a hit  I mean it  I like that  it's gonna be a hit  believe it or not  I like that  it's not  it's gonna be some  bizarre hit  I like that more  today than when I  heard it last night  I gotta be honest  did ya  yeah I didn't hate  it as much  it annoyed me  last night  you got your picture  it doesn't matter  anymore  I'm telling you  why wouldn't I  exactly  I like that song  do ya  I'm being really honest  I'm not trying to be  different  I really do  is it gonna be on  your iPod  you'll be walking  down the street  to die  it is different 
[03:44:30]  man I like it  it bored me  overall last night  because I wanted  to hear other stuff  if he would have  mixed in police songs  with that  I would have  enjoyed the performance  I'll go home  and get your  fucking shine box  fields of gold  or whatever  on the lute  was pretty cool  I would have  enjoyed that  if he had  thrown in like  three police songs  plus the two  at the end  in the middle  and not been  I don't want to  hear that dumb  blues song  he did  to die  to die 
[03:45:00]  there's a little  too many things  to laugh  to cry  alright we understand  every emotion  possible  shut up  to fall  to tap down  we got an author  on the phone here  to stand up  to sit down  author author  Jonathan Black  yeah good morning  guys  hi sir  what's your deal  my deal  yeah  a book I wrote  called  yes you can  yes you can  it's all about the motivational speaker business  what made you want to do this  did you have a dislike of these guys  you know I had a suspicion of these guys  I've seen them  I'm sure you have  you know they stand up there 
[03:45:30]  they tell everybody  you can do it  no matter what you want  you have no limitations  tell you the truth  we have not seen these guys  we like girls  okay  well you know  there are very few women  who are motivational speakers  there must be a reason for that  yes that's not true  but you must have seen  Tony Rama's infomercials  on late night TV  should have been called  yes you can  if Frank Sinatra says so  right  I think it was Sammy Davis  who said something like that  but sure  wow  you're a Spinal Tap fan  yeah  right  okay  at least you got the fucking joke 
[03:46:00]  Jesus Christ  so a lot of these guys  you know  tell you can do anything  and really they get paid  a lot of money  to stand up  people go to their seminars  they go to their meetings  guys get paid  ten, fifteen, twenty five thousand dollars  yeah  same speech  over and over again  yeah  what about Tony Robbins  made you want to  go to  money  Tony Robbins  is a huge  huge success  you know that  oh yeah  lots of cash  and then the guy 
[03:46:30]  motivates people  supposedly  he does  what is he doing  what is he doing  what is he actually doing  if not motivating these people  he's getting up there  and telling them  you can do whatever you want  don't pay any attention  to your limitations  and there's a good message  in that  a lot of people think  hey you know  I'm this way  I'm that way  but you're kind of saying  there are really  just stupid people  out there  that are incapable  of doing such things  there are a lot of stupid  people out there  that's for sure  but there are a lot of people  who have like a kind of 
[03:47:00]  negative view of themselves  might do better  to you know  think they could do  anything they want  you know people like that  what was your view  on Tony Robbins  like what was your experience  going in  and what did you find out  Tony Robbins actually  has a lot to say  he says  the basic message  is really  you want to do something  different  you can change  in a second  the only problem is  you have to be ready  to change  it's like  you want great ads  well you've got to  you know  good  start doing a diet  and doing 100 sit-ups  every morning  it'll work  but you've got to be 
[03:47:30]  ready to do that  but he is a terrific  salesman  that's what really  made him  and he's somebody  who really does  motivate you  but you have to  see him a lot  that's the trick  what about  what about Dr. Phil  Dr. Phil  now there's  he motivates me  to go to sleep  actually  or to switch channels  oh sorry  I'm stealing your bit  no I was good  well a lot of people  let me ask you  a lot of people  they're saying that  when it comes to  like Tony Robbins  and others of that ilk 
[03:48:00]  oh I don't know  it tends to kind of  veer away  like originally  they say  we're going to  motivate you  but then what happens  is eventually  people  they forget  you know  well right  no but that's not  it's completely  the opposite  of what I'm saying  do you find that 
[03:48:30]  these guys  help  like initially  are they supposed  to help  and  then everybody  backtracks  or is it just  basically a change  of heart  halfway through  tell them  it's you know  it's really difficult  to listen to somebody  do any kind of change  no I don't think  you understood  my question  is it  is it  something  is it  what  is it  something  that can be  done  by 
[03:49:00]  by everyone  or is this  a very specific  style  like you know  because a guy  like Tony Robbins  like we were talking  about Tony Robbins  the guy has  charisma  spunk  and the ability  to motivate  right  that's right  now did you find  that that changed  people's opinions  or was there  subsequently  some type of a switch  that didn't occur  oh yeah  no I think it does  I mean first of all  you go in here  and you think  wow this isn't  a terrific guy  he's like really  got to act together  I could be like that 
[03:49:30]  and he's telling you  you can  so yeah it works  you know  but how long  does it work for  you know  right  right  I'm eating enough  well how much  I mean  is there a lot  of footwork  involved  and like say  the individual  may be ready  to change  but he's not  too sure  then forget it  I wasn't finished  but you can just  answer the first half  no no  go ahead  if you're not  ready to change  it's going to  take you a while  you've got to  be motivated  you've got to  be ready  you've got to  be on the edge  I mean  yes you can 
[03:50:00]  I talk a lot  about different  ways people  want to change  but they've  really got to  want to change  they've got to  be ready  and Tony  Robin says  you can  change in an instant  but you've got to  make the choice  to change  you've got to  be ready  to make that  decision  Jonathan  this is Opie  I found your book  very interesting  thank you  on page 67  let me read  something here  sure  often what starts  out as hardy  uplift  ends in outer  space  if there is  anything remotely  connected to his  audience  it is this 
[03:50:30]  yeah  that's it  we're talking  about a guy  there who  makes a ton  of money  motivating people  he has a  really compelling  story to tell  he lost his  legs  he overcame  every kind  of adversity  how did he  lose his legs  he was born  with these  that's terrific  that's terrific  what happened  what happened  he was born  with these  weird stumpy  legs 
[03:51:00]  then he had  a car accident  he decided to  go on prosthesis  he became a star  in the Special Olympics  became a doctor  became an opera singer  he's done everything  he's incredibly  motivated  I don't think  he's doing everything  I've heard now  this is a rumor  or no  I've heard that  the legs actually  do work  and this whole  thing's a scam  well I've seen  them  they work pretty  good on fake  legs actually  it's not a scam  but what he says  is pretty disjointed  yeah but can he do  jumping jacks  disjointed  yeah right  are you saying 
[03:51:30]  Tony Robbins is a fraud  no  Tony Robbins  you heard it here  no he is not  Tony Robbins is a fraud  what is this book about  it says like an expose  where it exposes  behind the hype  and hustle  the motivation biz  a lot of people  oh go ahead  I wasn't finished  but you go ahead  you go right ahead  I mean there's no reason  for me to actually  ask the question  go ahead  it's all about you  a lot of people  make a lot of money  doing this  they give the same speech  80 times a year  like they make  you know  millions plus  easily  but I'm saying  did Tony Robbins  does he motivate people 
[03:52:00]  or is the whole thing  a put on  no  Tony Robbins  definitely motivates people  he motivates presidents  he motivates sports teams  well then I'd like to know  what is behind the hype  and hustle  of a motivational biz  a lot of other people  a lot of people  get up there  they don't have much to say  but then what exactly  are they doing sir  what are they doing  they're collecting  they're collecting  a lot of money  for something  they should probably  not be getting  so much money for  so basically  what you're saying  is that these people  are frauds 
[03:52:30]  and that they've been  stealing from  John Q. Public  is that  oh go ahead  just jump right in  whenever you feel like  I have to let somebody  finish the question  go ahead  you wrote the book  you know  that's a little bit  of an exaggeration  but you know  I would like to have  some type of clarity  on this  sure  well they promised  something that most people  mostly they can't deliver  you see but the book  doesn't seem to clarify that  well  the book is called  yes you can  yes you can  that's what's that title  supposed to mean  yeah  that's the message  that most 
[03:53:00]  right yeah okay  give the stock  the stock answer  uh top motivator  that's terrible  I'm sorry  that's okay  what  that's terrible  I'm sorry  no no no no  no no  uh yeah  Steve uh  has a comment about  uh  you  why not  he's asking  why not sir  Jonathan  yes sorry  okay  Steve do it again  I'm sorry  me and Steve  are talking  and I'm saying  I don't think 
[03:53:30]  this book  will help people  no no no no  no no no  the book is  is to expose  some of the speakers  why not  promise to help people  sure  no  nothing's wrong  just stay in the living room  I'll handle it  okay  Steve  what's my problem  you're in my  fucking house  well Steve  picked up your book  and uh  he's a little upset  about it  I can see that  right  probably needs to  you know  quiet down  maybe a little  less motivated  some people are  too motivated 
[03:54:00]  no no no no  that's terrible  I'm sorry  yeah he's apologized  now  alright  you can be  the other motivator  you know  you get to  you promise something  you think  oh I can do it  you go back to your office  and you can't do anything  greatest kid  a little fucking  madness  greatest emotional  motivational speaker  uh Hitler  yes or no  yeah Hitler was a  one of the great  motivational speakers  finally  of all time  right  so you're saying  basically  unfortunately  you're basically saying  that you agree  with that type of a message  and that these guys  are no good  I'm not talking  about the message  I'm saying 
[03:54:30]  he was a successful  motivator  yeah  but he had a  hideous message  Dale Carnegie's  statement on  influencing people  how do you feel  about that  go  actually Dale Carnegie  is a pretty good  guy you know  he was uh  you know  really understand  people understand  what the other  person is thinking  how to win  friends and influence  people  it was like a  1930s book  yeah you would know  a lot of meaningful  things to say  it's not quite  what people think  it is  Newt Rockne  you know  anybody in sports  is a natural  hit on the  motivational  Joe Torre 
[03:55:00]  he might  his stock  might have fallen  a little bit  Phil Jackson  Phil Jackson  was one of the  top coaches  and continues  to make a ton  of money  John Mark Carr  you were talking  about Zig Ziglar  Zig Ziglar  is a motivational  speaker  of the pros  and cons  in comparison  with Tony Robbins  taking into account  what Dale Carnegie  said go  Zig Ziglar  is one of the  all time legends  but he's gotten  very religious  yeah but there's  a whole thing 
[03:55:30]  that happened  with him  come on  we all know  what's going on  with Zig Ziglar  and yet the  community's protecting  him  who's protecting  him  exactly  you know you're  right  yep  Zig Ziglar  is still around  you know  which is more  interesting  for most people  who are 78  is out there  on the hustings  doing his thing  but you have to  be kind of  you know this  reminds me of  a funny story  oh  I interrupted her  shy man  you know this  reminds me of  a funny story  yeah  I'm sorry  are you asking  a question  you know what 
[03:56:00]  my mom used  to say about  that  what  what did  your mom used  to say  about  now guys  let's not  make fun  of people  we're not  making fun  of the author  you witch  we're just  asking questions  she's very  sensitive sometimes  to how we  treat the guests  oh but guys  you want to hear  a really funny  story  did you tell it  already then  I don't think  John wants to  sit and  listen to you 
[03:56:30]  babble  I know Bill  will be on my  side with this  he's the one  with the conscience  Bill  are you on her  side  do you bad  mouth anyone  in this book  yes  of course  who do you  bad mouth  well I'm not  going to read  names  you can buy  the book  yes you can  I don't have  to I got it  for free  give up  a name  sir  who do you  bad mouth  people want  to hear that  yeah who do  you bad mouth  there are  individuals who  get up and  do not deliver  what they say  they do 
[03:57:00]  who  who or  who  Richard Simmons  you're not  going to get  out of me  you want to  find out  buy the book  Richard Simmons  right  Richard Simmons  they don't even  mention in the book  why is he a  motivation  he is a  motivation  show me how  you suck a  guy's cock  the last time  I'm going to  ask you  that's from  Richard Simmons  sweating to the  testes  see the thing  I'm saying is  this people  will buy the  book if they  know someone  is going to  get bad  mouth but  they're not  just going to  buy it to  hear good  things about  motivational  speakers  people want 
[03:57:30]  to get into  the negativity  yep  so I'm saying  who do you  bad mouth  give us  something on  somebody that's  negative  well I  already did  I thought  about a  guy who  had his  legs chopped  off and  gets up  and he has  a great  life story  to tell  but when  you listen  to him  he's got  nothing to  say  you can't  even follow  from one  sentence to  the next  on top of  that  he's not  the kind  of person  he says  other people  should be  he's rude  not a nice  person  and that's  not what  a motion  motivated  person  should be  and if  you read  the book  you'd know  his name  plus 
[03:58:00]  Zig Ziglar  you know  he has a lot  of questionable  things to say  it's pretty  simple minded  a lot of  the stuff  and you've  got to bear  in mind  how much  money  these guys  make  is it worth  that much  money  he gets  paid  $50,000  Rudy Giuliani  gets paid  $100,000  to go on  the Get  Motivated  show  goes around  the country  probably been  in your city  that's a lot  of money  doing what  telling people  what he's  been telling  them for  a while  you like 
[03:58:30]  Rudy Giuliani  hello  what happened 
[03:59:00]  to the author  I'm right  here  why did he  hang up  I'm right  here  what happened  to Jonathan  I'm right  here  checking  hello  I'm checking  the line  hold on  yeah  he was talking  about  that was going  really well  too  what happened  to him  he was talking  about Giuliani  and then he  hung up  no  didn't hang  up  what happened  to Jonathan  I wanted to talk  about Giuliani  too  because you know  the whole  America's Mayor  thing  and what happened 
[03:59:30]  after 9-11  I want to hear  more about  how he gets  what $50,000  a speech  or something  like that  that's what he was  saying  and then I heard  like a beep  a buzz  and nothing  I don't know  what happened  oh wait  he's back in line  Jonathan  yes  what happened  I have no idea  hello  Jonathan  I'm right here  you said he's  back in the line  who's screening  today  what line  12  yes  did the screener  put him on hold  they're saying 12 
[04:00:00]  I think you might be on  uh you know  I'm on  try 12  Jonathan  is that you  try line 12  alright  no there's no one there  I think I hear something  in the background  Jonathan  I'm right here  damn it  cause the Giuliani thing  is like really  you know  kind of  relate to it  my book  didn't have a 77  I would have liked  to have heard  his opinions  on Giuliani  I want to talk to him  about  just start on page 81  please  yeah  I think it was pretty interesting  I want to get him back on the phone  Jonathan 
[04:00:30]  I'm here  hello  are you there  Jonathan  Jonathan  wait I hear something  in the background  I'm here  you guys  Jonathan Black  hello  you must have a tech problem  hello  Jonathan  I think I hear  I am here  Jonathan  Jonathan  yes  what's up  our connection is really bad right now  something happened  I got it  could you speak up  I can shout  how's that  just ask if he can hear  I could  like I'm hearing something  is that him 
[04:01:00]  I don't know  hello  hello  Jonathan  are you there  Jonathan  is that any better  hello  a little bit  I can hear something  I heard him for a second  I think  okay  this is the second time  this has happened  it's a little annoying  it's embarrassing  is what it is  hello  I'm right here guys  you just disappeared on me  I disappeared on you  I  can  hello  yeah  can you talk loud  I can't even  this is an audio problem  we've had  it's a little better 
[04:01:30]  it's on the feed coming in  but it's hard  you can probably hear us  I can hear you perfectly  but I can't shout any louder than this  alright  what's  what's the name of the book again  with Giuliani  I wanted to hear a little bit about him  you mentioned Giuliani  then we thought you hung up  Giuliani gets a hundred thousand dollars  ten thousand dollars  no  one hundred thousand dollars  a hundred bucks  for a speech  that's a lot of money  and he gives about  ten of them a year  to teach what  he gets ten thousand dollars a speech 
[04:02:00]  and he gives a hundred speeches a year  that's ridiculous  that's ridiculous  he shouldn't be doing that  plus he's probably running for office  what  he's trying to get motivated  what  it's wrong  it's wrong  alright so he's saying  that he wrote Giuliani  Giuliani's getting  a thousand dollars to teach  that's a lot of money too  what makes him a motivator  he was great  at 9-11  he stood up there  he's a great leader  Jonathan  if you can hear me  one of the listeners has a question  can you hear me 
[04:02:30]  yes  uh they want to know  if you've ever been in a grope room  I've never been in a grope room  but I'm sorry  I'm willing to try it  trying to hear again  no  alright  yeah well  we'll take I guess  a couple of calls  because a lot of people  are very fascinated  with uh  what's going on  a lot of people  have bought the hype  the hype  and the hustle  of the motivation biz 
[04:03:00]  Jonathan  yep  hello  yes  yeah okay  we got  calls coming in  but um  alright let's go to  Jim  Jim in South Carolina  do you have a  a question for  Jonathan Black  he wrote the book  Yes You Can  Go  Yes  did uh  so he's paying  Giuliani  a hundred dollars  to  go in a grope room  yeah you know  I've been shouting 
[04:03:30]  you obviously lost  your texting  yeah  yeah  I'm sorry  it uh  it happens  hello  no Jonathan  we got you back  but the caller  didn't understand  something about  Giuliani I guess  I guess the price  he's getting  per speech  is what people  weren't really hearing  one hundred  thousand dollars  oh okay  a hundred thousand  dollars  that makes more  sense  I was gonna say  a hundred or  a thousand dollars  is ridiculous  and it would be  ridiculous  and 
[04:04:00]  one hundred thousand  and he's  motivating people  yeah I mean  he uh  wouldn't you be  motivated by him  wait I  he's great at  9-11  but that's  I barely heard  money  I barely heard  that  yeah Jonathan  we heard the first  half of that  I'm sorry  he motivate  what  I'm sure  he motivates  people  he was a  terrific guy  at 9-11  but you know  that was  five years  ago  you know  don't buy  into the  conspiracy  with 9-11  I thought  you were  above that  whatever it 
[04:04:30]  was  he was up  there  he was an  important guy  then  yeah  that's  motivating  though  he motivates  I think  I think  personally  but I've  never seen  him  let's get  more questions  uh  balloon  uh  Joe  what's up  uh  hi  guys  I  I  have  a  question  for  Jonathan  Jonathan  can you hear me  yes I can  Jonathan  I like to  glue my  my yam bag  to my balloon  knot  as a motivational 
[04:05:00]  technique  it makes me  move a little  faster  have you ever  tried that  never  that's a good  question  you should  try it  it really  it gives you  a little  pull  and makes  your day  go faster  it makes  you move  a lot  harder  are the lines  uh  very busy  today  yeah let's  uh  let's go  hi who's  this  this is  Mark  hey Mark  you got a  question for  Jonathan  Black  I do  why uh  ten payments  of a thousand  dollars to buy  his book
