<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between them. The show began with a discussion of Anthony's extensive home renovations, spearheaded by his friend Keith.  This involved humorous anecdotes about the luxurious new home theater, including a massive 150-inch projection screen, motorized seating, and a bar,  as well as Keith's increasingly bold interactions with Anthony's neighbors, involving fabricated stories about Anthony to entertain them.  Anthony joked about Keith subtly taking over his house.

This segued into a discussion of their over-the-top response to a perceived attack from a Utah radio show, which they later discovered was minimal.  They played back recordings of their aggressive and vulgar response, followed by calls from the Utah host's brother-in-law and wife who were listeners.  They acknowledged their excessive reaction without apology and announced "Jocktober," a segment dedicated to criticizing other radio shows.

The "Jocktober" segment featured a scathing review of "The People's Morning Show" from Harrisburg, PA, hosted by Nipsey, Earl, and Jen Shade.  Sam presented clips, and the hosts ridiculed the show’s hosts’ appearances, on-air chemistry, jokes, and attempts at intellectual humor.  Studio guest Auto from "Auto and George" joined the discussion, sharing his experiences with local radio and travel mishaps. The segment also touched upon the upcoming presidential election (criticizing Sarah Palin and John McCain), a workplace incident involving a staff member named Kenny, and haunted locations like a Vegas hotel suite and the Comedy Store.  The segment concluded with a mention of an upcoming "Down and Dirty" segment and the playing of ghost videos.

A subsequent segment featured Otto (from Auto and George) as a guest, focusing on a compilation of creepy 70s videos and movie reviews.  They discussed Al Pacino's later films, *Tropic Thunder*, *Meet the Parents*, and *Titanic*, debating movie lengths and Hollywood's priorities. They also discussed Bill Maher's documentary on organized religion and a news story about a burglary at Hugh Laurie's home,  which led to Otto recounting his own experience with laptop theft and extortion involving his ex-girlfriend.  The conversation then drifted to Jimmy Tingle's comedy, Bubba the Love Sponge's hypocrisy (regarding Opie and Anthony's employment), listener calls about Bubba, and the suicide of a New York police lieutenant following a taser incident.

The final segment focused on the 2008 presidential election, specifically racially charged jokes about Barack Obama's middle name, Hussein, and concerns about his suitability for the presidency.  This was interwoven with a critique of a poorly received SiriusXM promotional audio clip, with the hosts dissecting its content, the directives from Don Wicklin in DC, and comparing it to Howard Stern's promo.  This segment also included morbid humor about a missing adventurer's plane crash, a caller's story about his mother leaving the family, and discussions of the emotional reactions of various sports figures and Bruce Kelly (in recorded audio clips).  Kenny was frequently mentioned throughout.  The show was punctuated throughout with numerous instances of offensive language, impersonations, sexually suggestive humor, and technical difficulties with phone lines.  The hosts also discussed Sarah Palin, playing audio of her past interview and flute performance at a beauty pageant; the demolition of Shea Stadium versus the preservation of Yankee Stadium; and the fact that Tiffany, the 80s pop singer, was 37 years old.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And it begins another busy Opiate Anthony show.  Good morning.  Hi.  How is everybody today?  Hi, everybody.  Thursday.  Thursday?  Yes.  Thursday.  All right.  24 hours.  I'll be sitting here and it'll be Friday. 
[00:00:30]  Nice.  Almost.  And the party starts.  I was going to say almost party time.  Almost party time.  It's getting too goddamn cold now.  I hate the winter.  I hate it.  Yeah, you scared all of us because we thought you were wearing the big coat today.  No, no, not my big parka.  I have my nice little 5'11 jacket.  Love my 5'11 wear.  Yeah.  But that's when we know winter is truly here, when you start wearing the big coat. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  That completely covers your body.  You got maybe, what, a dime-sized hole that you look through?  Yeah, it's pretty much, I pull the hood up.  It's a Kenny snorkel jacket, basically.  I pull the hood up so you can't really see me.  I can barely see anything.  I just kind of look up every so often to make sure I'm not walking into somebody.  It's very heavy, very insulated.  Because, sorry, 40-mile-an-hour winds whipping through the artificial canyons of Manhattan when  it's 20 degrees out.  You know, you might as well be climbing Everest. 
[00:01:30]  It's cold.  I hate, hate the cold.  It's going to be 70 today, so you still have time.  So, goddamn Keith last night talked me into my winter activity at the house.  Yeah?  Which is now going to be a giant home theater in my basement.  With a 150-inch screen.  You're getting that screen?  No, it's a projection. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, okay.  You scared me because they had a TV on display.  Yeah.  And I was looking at Ant going, there you go, there's your next purchase.  No, with a home theater of this size, it's got to be like a projection screen.  Okay.  But, like, motorized seats that recline and go back and a bar and all kinds of just stuff.  And the whole thing is going to look like a nice, classy, oldie-time movie theater.  Nice.  With all the little curtains and everything.  And you walk in and you watch these movies.  And the system isn't like you've got to go and pop a DVD in anymore. 
[00:02:30]  It's all on hard drive.  Everything's downloaded from the internet.  And you get the choice of movies.  They all go up on the screen and you scroll through them.  Scroll, scroll, scroll.  And you just click on the goddamn movie you want to watch.  And there it is in ridiculous sound.  Pop one of those pictures up there, Danny.  The sound system is just like a movie.  The thing rumbles.  And the screen, yeah, it's just going to be insane.  And that's for the winter.  And then the summer's the pool.  Yeah, the future. 
[00:03:00]  You know what's funny really fast?  We're getting to see what Keith would do if he had money.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  I mean, you're absolutely right.  He walks around that place like he owns it.  He's kicking people out of rooms.  I'm like, yeah, if you want to stay over, say that.  No, I'm locking that room.  No one's going in there.  Yeah.  And he gets his wife, Ann, to set up another room for other people so they don't invade his space.  Yeah, it's all wonderful, but we really don't know what your tastes are, what you like. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, I don't know either.  You're enjoying what your house has become, but this is Keith's taste.  Him and his wife are basically living their fantasies through you.  It's their pet project.  Right.  Keith is like writing checks for me and sending them off to people.  I'm like, what the hell is he doing?  And then it was suggested that what happens if he just writes a check for himself?  So like Michael Corleone, I'm not against shooting a cop, a dirty cop. 
[00:04:00]  We got papers.  We got people on the newspapers.  He's got like a real-life Sims game.  Yeah.  He's just getting furniture and expanding things.  Yeah, the Sims.  He's playing the Sims with my house.  Your house, your money.  It's real-life Sims.  He's locking doors.  He's kicking people out.  He's buying.  He's purchasing.  He's slowly poisoning Anthony.  Yeah.  Changing the will.  Yeah, exactly.  And he's inviting neighbors. 
[00:04:30]  I heard about this neighbor thing.  Holy mother of God.  I'm just hanging out in the house.  And Keith's out back.  He's enjoying a little glass of wine.  And there's a house being built behind my house.  I got a fence up, you know, a big fence, a lot of plantings that kind of camouflage everybody else's house.  I don't want to see people.  I don't want them looking in my yard.  Might be shenanigans going on in there. 
[00:05:00]  So the owner, who's an Asian gentleman, he's outside the house.  And he's been there a few times.  Checking out the progress?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He doesn't seem to speak much English, but enough to understand.  But, you know, you can't just carry on a normal conversation with him.  You've got to kind of talk slow and everything.  So Keith is like, Anthony, Anthony's calling me and laughing.  So I come to the door and I'm like, what?  And then he turns to the neighbor and goes, excuse me. 
[00:05:30]  Excuse me.  And the neighbor comes to the fence and in an accent I would love to imitate here, which would be a prime place to actually do it because it wouldn't be mocking anything.  It wouldn't be stereotyping anything.  It would be me doing an impression like I do of anybody of an Asian gentleman talking.  That doesn't speak much English.  Right.  Some broken English.  But for some reason, I can't do that here.  This would be a very accurate impression.  Accurate.  It wouldn't have any it wouldn't be a bad thing. 
[00:06:00]  It wouldn't be me making fun of anybody.  It would just be an accurate impression of what this guy sounded like.  But because people run in fear, I can't do that.  But back to the story.  All right.  So Keith, he goes, yeah.  Hey, how you doing?  He goes, when your house is done, you come over for dinner.  You come over.  And I'm standing there like with a smile on his gone.  Oh, my God.  He's he's inviting the Asian gentleman over for dinner. 
[00:06:30]  And then the Asian gentleman goes, he was talking about knocking down part of fence so  we can come back and forth.  No.  Yes.  I was horrified.  And then Keith is like, yeah, we have parties here.  You come over.  You come over.  You might as well knock down the fence because if you don't, you know, there's going to be  a tunnel, Doug.  Well, that's true.  So I'll have to send someone in with one of my 45s and a flashlight in their mouth.  Take care of that problem.  The neighbor just trying to get to the party. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  You don't know where that goes.  All of a sudden, you just all of a sudden, you just see your pool drain.  Like, what's going on?  What's happening?  I think.  So he's doing that.  Is Keith just like whistling a happy tune around your house now that Jill's gone?  Because now that means he's back in your life.  He's back in smiling.  He just, you know, I come home the other day.  There's a big truck in my in my driveway unloading brand new outdoor furniture. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  And it's the same stuff he has at his house.  I'm telling you, man.  So he'll feel comfortable sitting in it.  This is a perfect situation because you, like myself, we don't really care.  Yeah.  But he plays to sleep a few beers.  I'm fine.  But he does.  So you get all the stuff you need to live comfortably.  But it's his taste, which makes him happier.  Oh, he loves it.  He is so waiting for any vacation I go on or anything because he's moving in. 
[00:08:00]  Well, when I was at that party, I noticed that his room is getting quite impressive.  Yeah.  Thanks.  The first time I went over your house when this whole process started of you deciding  after a year that you were going to put stuff in your house, you know, he had a little  little room set aside.  Dude, there was just a little like ratty, like comforter and a pillow, just a place that  crashed real fast.  Now it's like it's one of the nicest rooms I've ever seen in my life.  Here's what it was.  It was my old bedroom set because I had gotten a new one from my room. 
[00:08:30]  Sure.  It was my old bedroom set in there and a dresser, my old dresser.  And on the dresser sat what had to be a 15-inch TV, old tube TV, but little 15-inch portable  kind of TV sitting up there with no cable box.  And that was it.  Now there's a new bed in there, new bedroom set. 
[00:09:00]  What?  Yes.  Why?  Because it's his room.  Okay.  A new bedroom set, new dresser, a giant plasma TV on the wall now.  There's no more little 15-inch TV.  That's gone.  There's little...  Look at this bedroom full of beautiful prizes.  A plasma TV set.  A brand new bedroom set.  Decor, decor, decor. 
[00:09:30]  And on the dresser sits a picture in a frame of Keith and his wife?  No.  Keith and the kids?  No.  It's Keith and me.  Aww.  Keith and me.  With the Ferrari and the Lamborghini during Supercar Weekend.  Right.  That's the only picture in the room.  So...  And then there's a room that kind of connects to it through the bathroom.  Because it's got kind of a Brady Bunch bathroom where... 
[00:10:00]  Two rooms split.  One bathroom.  No, where the father has sex with another man and later dies.  Yeah, yeah.  It connects two rooms through the bathroom.  And he has chosen that to be his sitting room.  You don't need a sitting...  Now, I go and one of my couches that was downstairs before I got new couches is up there.  Yeah.  And there's a big TV up there and everything.  It's outrageous what he's doing.  Fast forward another year, you're going to be living in the maid's quarters. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Anthony has like a section that is so obvious.  If Ant was like a, quote, normal, I need a wife and family, this wouldn't be where the maid would live.  That's going to be your space eventually.  He's going to talk you into the maid quarters saying how that's the coolest part of the house and he's going to have the rest of the thing.  Well, now, one of the middle rooms upstairs, Angela seems to have, you know, started decorating that one.  And there's a bedroom set in there now and a dresser and a nice big rug on the floor. 
[00:11:00]  It's looking very nice.  Because, and the only reason this was done, is to keep any guests I have out of their room.  So now all the guests have to go there.  There's like a, he said, there's a hierarchy around here.  And it starts with people sleeping in the cabana.  And after that, they work their way up into the maid's quarters.  And then, you know, so I'm like, oh, this is great.  Do I have to stand at the door and go, you've been upgraded, sir.  That's great. 
[00:11:30]  We had you in the maid's room, but we're going to give you an upgrade to upstairs.  I want hotel room keys and the locks on the door, on all my doors.  So people get handed the keys and they just slip them in and go in their room.  It's a bed and breakfast filled with orgies.  It's insanity.  It's like a flop house you're running.  Flop house.  A really nice flop house.  Yeah.  Just hope they don't all of a sudden bring bunk beds in.  No, we don't want bunk beds.  What's that tapping noise? 
[00:12:00]  Well, that's today's problem.  What's today's problem?  Well, that's good.  Do you guys hear that?  Yeah.  What's that?  It's going faster.  Huh?  I don't have no idea.  Is the phone all of a sudden?  Oh, link to server is down, it says, on the phone.  Oh, really?  Yeah, see?  All right, we're going to reboot the phones.  Everybody wants to talk about Anthony and his, yeah, see, it is the phone.  All right, well, that's not too distracting.  Where were we?  So, oh, if you see the bunk beds arrive, then you know you're in trouble. 
[00:12:30]  There's a problem.  Because now they're going to take a chance and move their kids in.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's when you're going to finally have it.  I do get a little nervous when the kids are over.  They are over?  Well, the kids come over sometimes, you know.  What do they call you?  Meal ticket?  What do they call you?  They're not calling you Uncle Anthony.  No, there's no Uncle Anthony.  They have to call you something.  They have to call me by name.  I think I just say hi, and they go hi, and that's it, and then they just run off somewhere.  And then they run and hide in one of the many rooms? 
[00:13:00]  I don't have a child-safe house, you know, except for my dates, and that's not safe.  No bag.  It's a big thing on the side of your bed so they don't fall out.  Yeah, you've got to put the little sides up.  Danny, is this you?  Ant's house is like Project Mayhem?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that's what I was called.  From my club?  That's pretty good, actually.  It was like my house is like the house on Paper Street. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  And Danny was saying maybe I should hand out Kumia reward points for people that stay for  extended periods of time, and people that frequent the Hotel Kumia.  You're not giving out the reward points for people that are staying.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  You're giving them out for something else that might be happening in the house.  You want a reward?  Come here.  Yeah, Kumia honor, as they would call it.  Yeah.  Like after nine face paintings, you get your...  I'm honor. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Well, face paintings.  I have clowns over the house.  Are you going to have the neighbors over or what?  The new neighbors that are going to be moving into that house back in the...  No!  Yeah.  I would know what to say to them.  You'd see my collection of memorabilia I got in the house and be horrified.  You think they would be?  Yeah.  I think...  No, I'm talking about the new neighbor.  That's a different war.  No, no, the new neighbor.  I'm not going to... 
[00:14:30]  They'd be...  He'd be horrified, too.  You think?  Yeah.  What do you think?  He wants to see big flags of the rising sun up on the wall?  Replay that part of history?  I don't think so.  I noticed Keith's wife took my Nazi officer's hat and put it in my office.  It was being proudly displayed in my kitchen.  I guess that's not a good spot when workers are coming over.  You tell them that's a good spot.  It's your house. 
[00:15:00]  I know.  I don't care.  Why would you tell them that you want the Nazi hat in the kitchen?  Why would anyone care if I have a Nazi officer's hat on a shelf in my kitchen?  It's just...  It's part of history.  I'm not celebrating anything.  I'm not a member of the Nazi party or the American socialists, the national socialists.  I just...  I'm a fan of the era.  What's their ultimate goal, you think?  To get me out of the house and to have the house for free.  I already told you what Keith told one of the Indian neighbors that I have, because he 
[00:15:30]  was like, where...  Oh, can I do the accent?  Jesus.  Picture an Indian accent.  He goes, where is the gentleman that lived here before?  Because he assumed Keith lived there.  Right.  I was on vacation at the time, and Keith is there all the time.  And Keith doesn't care.  He'll walk out with a coffee cup in his underwear on the lawn and look around.  You know, like you do when it's your place?  Yeah.  Hand on hip.  You're kind of just surveying your property going, yep.  Waiting for the... 
[00:16:00]  Yep.  Waiting for the paper boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just in his drawers, just drinking some coffee.  And this guy goes, where's the gentleman that lived here before?  He goes, oh, he was arrested for child pornography and drug charges.  And the guy was horrified.  He goes, oh, my God, really?  And Keith's like, yeah, yeah.  He goes, so the feds took the place, and I bought it at auction.  And he goes, oh, how much did you buy for, if I might ask?  And Keith said some outrageous price, like $160,000, like a fraction of the price. 
[00:16:30]  And the guy was like, wow, that's a great deal.  And Keith's like, yeah.  And then he just walks back in and leaves the guy hanging like that.  So now when I walk around, if I see somebody that's like, oh, there's the guy with the  kiddie porn that sells drugs.  All of a sudden, you see the shades go down.  Yeah.  They're all horrified at me.  They're all just hiding in the house.  They're like, oh, my God, he got out of jail.  How did he work that one?  And he told the guy behind, the Asian gentleman that's building the house behind me, that the  backyard landscaping, because he goes, how much was that? 
[00:17:00]  And Keith goes, oh, this was like $50,000.  And meanwhile, it was a little more, perhaps more than that.  Right, right.  But he just, Keith lies to everyone around me.  I'm also hearing that Keith is going to suggest maybe to the new Chinese neighbor that you  and him are gay.  Yes, that's what he said, too.  Right.  Yeah.  What am I?  Yesterday, he goes, when I see him, I'm going to tell him that we're gay lovers.  Yeah.  He goes, that ought to really get his head spinning.  Yeah.  He can't think, Keith cannot think of things fast enough to screw up, like, my relationship 
[00:17:30]  that I don't have with my neighbor.  No, it's perfect.  That's what you want.  You don't want any interaction with the neighbors, and this is the way to go about it.  I don't want them firebombing my house, either.  You want them to think you're gay or into child porn, and they'll all leave you alone,  Ant.  Which is perfect.  And it's just perfect.  Chase me out.  Keith wants to yell to the guy, oh, let me get my husband.  Yeah, yeah, that's what he's doing.  Let me get my husband.  And then he'll just call my name without letting me know he just said that, and I'll come walking  out.  Oh, and you say, like, you know, oh, that's funny. 
[00:18:00]  Keith is an ass.  That's wonderful.  He's a complete ass.  Listen, we would go to the phones right now, but this is what we get today.  Some of it's cool.  Come on, come on.  Well, I feel like I'm at Belmont.  My horse is coming in.  See, the company thought it was a great idea to...  Very good, actually.  The company thought it was a great idea to fire pretty much everyone about six months  ago, thinking that nothing would change.  Well, I'm starting to notice that this place is breaking down now.  Yeah.  This is the other side of firing everybody. 
[00:18:30]  The product suffers.  When the machine breaks down, we break down.  This is what we have today for phones.  That's the phones?  That's the phones so far.  It'd be funny if we just left that on and the ratings went up.  It's better than 90% of the callers we get.  Yeah, no kidding.  And what's up with the laptop?  You smashing that today?  It worked.  It did?  Yeah, see, you got to make threats before you break it.  Anti-climatic.  Yeah, it was.  That stinks. 
[00:19:00]  All right, we're going to take a quick break because we have a lot to do today.  We have the Sarah Palin thing.  It's just fun for everybody.  I don't care if you're a Republican or a Democrat.  This broad is as dumb as they come.  Every time she opens a gap.  I'm sorry, Ant.  I know McCain's...  No, what do you care?  I agree.  I know McCain's your boy, and I know the Obama-Biden ticket has some problems too, obviously,  but this Sarah Palin is a dummy.  We got the latest one about the newspapers and the magazines to play for everybody.  You were saying in the office that we should be mad as Americans, and not because of what's 
[00:19:30]  going on, but because this is the only choices we were given.  That's what I was telling you.  And how is that possible?  And that should anger Americans more than, this one's a dummy, this one doesn't have experience,  this one...  Like, be angry at the big picture.  Why is it that these are the four people that we have to choose from, and that is it?  As Americans, we should be outraged.  And don't give me the independent candidates. 
[00:20:00]  Stop it already.  Well, we should be outraged that this is the best they could throw at us.  Sarah Palin obviously has no effing clue how our country works.  She knows how Alaska works, I guess, in the freaking town or the little city she runs.  She's a dimwit.  But Obama might as well be just a rock star, a Bono.  Have Bono run.  Right.  The only reason he's drawing crowds wherever he goes is because there's a cult of personality  around him that he's a rock star now, and people love him for that.  He's a great speaker with no substance. 
[00:20:30]  Then you got McCain.  He's a wonderful American, but he's a broken man.  The guy is broke.  He's old.  They're cutting pieces off of him every day.  And then Biden.  Wow.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  Biden's a loose cannon.  I don't know what's going on under those hair plugs, but it doesn't seem good.  Perhaps a couple of aneurysms.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, they talk about McCain being 72 years old.  Jesus Christ.  Biden's had a pudding head a couple of times. 
[00:21:00]  And as Americans, we're like, oh, Democrat this, Republican this.  It's like, no, as Americans, we should be pissed that this is what they threw in front of us.  Bring back the Whigs for this election.  The Whig Party.  It really is a disgrace, man.  It is.  It really is a disgrace.  This is the best America has to offer to its people.  No, because it's the way they run things over there.  It's just people feel they're owed.  They're owed a shot at the presidency.  And that's one reason they get in. 
[00:21:30]  Or they give a great speech at a Democratic National Convention.  Right.  And all of a sudden, everyone clamors, hey, this guy could be president.  Right.  And the public eats it up because the press just pumps the hell out of it.  Right.  It is a disgrace.  But there are independents that, you know, parole got 17% of the vote back in, what was it,  1992?  You know what?  That was an anomaly because that guy had so much goddamn money on his own.  And he wasn't getting contributions from people to finance his campaign. 
[00:22:00]  Meanwhile, you know, Obama can get Billy Joel and Springsteen to play for $10,000 a pop for seats.  Right.  And he's raising money hand over fist.  But I'm not even talking about independent, you know, candidates.  I'm talking about the two big parties.  Yeah, the two big parties.  This is the best they have for us this time around.  Exactly.  How about a great presidential candidate from one of the big parties?  You just don't see that.  You see people that feel they're owed it. 
[00:22:30]  And then they, at the beginning, they might speak candidly.  Obama did the same thing.  Clinton was great at that, at speaking very candidly and openly.  And he was very sincere sounding.  And then they get the nomination.  And they get pounced on by these Washington insider douches that are just business as usual.  And they make them start doing things like old time politicians.  And they lose that connection with the average American. 
[00:23:00]  I think Obama's lost a lot of that.  Like he had this whole kind of down to earth thing.  But now when he rolls up those shirt sleeves, you know some advisor told him, roll up the shirt sleeves.  Right.  He's believing his own hype.  You know when you discover a band and you get to see them in a small club, you're like, ah, man.  This is my band.  And you get to meet the band because they're very...  They're just hanging out.  They hang out.  They're at the bar after the gig.  Right, after the gig. 
[00:23:30]  Next thing you know, a year goes by, two years go by.  They're playing a bigger venue.  It's a little tougher to get at them.  And then next thing you know, they're playing Madison Square Garden and, you know...  Security's keeping you a mile away.  Oh, yeah.  Like, wait, I hung out and drank beers with the guy.  Yeah, you and eight million other people.  Get out of here.  Now you're getting your ass beat up because you tried to take a picture of the dude.  It's like, back in the day, we would have drank shots together.  Yeah.  What happened?  It's kind of happening to Obama a little bit.  Why don't we take a quick break?  Remember that show we beat up real good yesterday? 
[00:24:00]  Turns out they didn't really say anything that bad about us.  You mean we were just reactionary idiots?  Yeah.  We'll explain next.  Stay there.  That's all I can believe.  Open it.  You would have...  Want to say good morning to everybody?  To the regulars, we don't have phones.  I don't know what to tell you.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  877-212-ON-A.  It's not like we're a big radio show or anything.  No big deal.  I like how you just said, we have no phones, and then gave out the phone number. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, I did, right?  Because that's like, you know, when you drive home and you all of a sudden go, how did I  get home?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's the reflex.  It's the reflex.  Well, when we have the phones, you know the number.  It just sucks we don't have phones because we're off to a very good start.  And remember yesterday, we started a new bit called Jocktober.  Jocktober.  You got the dumb radio stations doing Rocktober.  Last year, we did E-Rocktober. 
[00:25:00]  Yes, tribute to our own dummy, E-Rock.  Yeah.  This year, we're doing Jocktober.  Mm-hmm.  It all started because we heard that this radio show in Utah was taking some shots at us.  Mm-hmm.  So, what did we do, Anthony?  Well, first we said, look, let's not jump the gun here.  Let's get the tape of what they said.  Yeah.  And see if it was something bad.  And then react accordingly. 
[00:25:30]  Then people started calling up and saying, yeah, they were bashing you.  And that's all we needed to hear.  And that's it.  Right.  Instead, all the logic of that first statement went right out the window and we went on the attack.  Yeah.  And it was, you know.  It was great radio.  It was a lot of fun to do.  And this hour-long response to what amounted to it.  Nothing that bad that they said.  But we do this every time, too.  We always say, well, let's wait and hear what they had to say.  But we never end up waiting. 
[00:26:00]  And once again, we did exactly that.  So, Sam, Sam finally heard the radio show in Utah.  Well, yeah.  I had our intern, Hip Hop Ron, listen to this show for about three hours yesterday looking for this, you know, clip of them talking about us.  And he finally found the about, I'd say, give or take two minutes that the Opie and Anthony show came up.  And it did.  It did.  They definitely talked about us.  Oh, boy.  We did an hour.  And it was brutal.  Yeah.  It was brutal what we were doing with their radio show yesterday. 
[00:26:30]  But they took some shots of their own.  Wow.  All right.  Well.  This is what started it all right here, this clip.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm surprised you're listening to the show.  Because he's all about these, that Opie and Anthony.  He's always comparing, you know, the show to Opie and Anthony.  We don't get you in New York.  I have to listen to ONA.  How funny.  It's funny.  I have to listen to ONA.  Well, Michelle will always say, yeah, Mark's telling, you know, tell Frankie Opie and Anthony did this or they tried this.  You guys should do this like Opie and Anthony do. 
[00:27:00]  What's that?  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  I never say that to you.  I never say that to Michelle because I know that you don't want to hear that.  I never tell Michelle, tell Frankie the ONA did this.  Well, then she's just getting my gum then.  That's Frankie's brother-in-law that called the show.  Uh-huh.  So Frankie probably, his brother-in-law probably lived out there and then moved here.  That's why he said, I have to listen to ONA because you guys aren't here.  Yeah.  So he's a fan.  He probably said that when he lived out in Utah.  Yeah.  And then it continues.  The truth of the matter is, is Michelle got her new car. 
[00:27:30]  She has XM radio in it and she's a closet ONA.  He listens to ONA on 202.  She better not.  Wait a minute.  No, wait a minute.  Frankie.  Wait a minute.  Are you kidding me?  She better.  She does.  She has XM.  But she told me she doesn't listen.  She better not listen to those guys.  I'm telling you, she calls me on the cell phone.  I just listened to ONA and they're disgusting.  Okay.  Trust me.  So she's listening.  But she doesn't.  Yeah, I believe her when she says that.  I don't think she listens to those.  I can't believe she even has an XM radio car, Frankie.  Yeah, but she's listening to music. 
[00:28:00]  So Frankie's one of the guys on the show.  I still, even though we did an hour on these guys, I still don't know who.  Frankie's who?  Frankie's one of the main guys on the show.  And that's his brother-in-law on the phone.  And his brother-in-law is saying Frankie, Frankie's wife, listens to our show on XM instead  of his show.  Yes.  Instead of her husband's show.  The morning zoo.  The morning zoo.  Okay.  All right.  Well, it sure is getting brutal about us.  Yeah.  It sure, you know.  Pretty much doing us a favor in Utah and doing a big commercial. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, yeah.  For our satellite side.  But it's like, wow.  That, what they just said, that deserves the response we gave.  No one said anything bad.  Oh, we are just idiots.  No one.  What were some of the things we said yesterday?  Oh, my God.  Just pick the usual.  We probably accused them of being pedophiles.  Hope they get AIDS.  Whatever it is.  I believe we said that Jim said she sounded like a deaf person who had bitten her tongue. 
[00:29:00]  I meant D-E-F.  No.  It continues.  They nabbed Frankie's wife.  D-B is very upset.  And Frankie's brother-in-law talks about how many listeners XM has.  Yes.  Okay.  So now the wife of one of the main guys calls the show?  Not yet.  This is still the clip of the brother-in-law.  Michelle, you're nabbed.  You're nabbed.  Listening to XM?  Yeah, that's nabbed.  Well, not while we're on.  Because, you know, she wants to hear if we're talking about her.  She wants to know. 
[00:29:30]  Radio's going to be free, man.  What's that about?  Yeah, I'm upset.  I'm upset, too.  She sold us down the river.  In the New York area, a lot of people is in XM.  We don't want to hear that.  Well, I'm sorry.  We're not as sophisticated as you, Mark.  Oh, wow.  One big commercial.  One big, nice commercial.  The assault continued.  Wow, that was...  You know, I can't even listen to this anymore.  I'm so insulted.  We're douches.  We are complete asses. 
[00:30:00]  We jump the gun constantly.  We never listened first.  No.  Why would we?  Some dumb listener.  Why would we?  Who probably just wants to start trouble.  Yeah.  Coax us into just an awful response to what amounted to really nothing but maybe a compliment.  We're like a dumb dog.  We're like that retarded kid that if you spray his face with water, he goes to the bathroom  on himself and runs in circles.  Morons.  You know, instead of doing what we did yesterday, we should have sent them a fruit basket or something. 
[00:30:30]  What are we doing?  And now Frankie's wife calls in?  Yes, this is Frankie's wife.  All right.  So are you...  When you listen to them, you say that you kind of just tune in because he says you need  to listen to them and then you are truly disgusted with them, right?  I listened once and they're filthy.  I would never...  I listened to Oprah and Friends.  Okay.  The only thing I listen to on XM.  I can't believe she has an XM.  Frank, that's horrible.  It came with the car.  Then you should have got a different car.  Wow, they had every opportunity to just go for it and try to rip out our voice box. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, boy.  And they plug Oprah and Friends.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get Oprah and Friends on XM as well as Oprah and Anthony in sports.  Did Oprah just go off on them?  See Oprah sitting there on a show and these guys are just asses.  Yeah.  Well, they did say the show was filthy.  I don't like that.  We had one man puking in another man's mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah, God forbid we're called filthy. 
[00:31:30]  What about the time Pat Duffy was brushing his teeth with dog you-know-what?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not filthy.  And then our discussions about, you know, sex.  Yeah.  They get a little racy.  Well, there you go.  That's what they did to us.  And our response was just, yeah.  Oof.  A napalming of the village.  Yeah.  And then realize, oh, it's the wrong village.  Oops.  Oh, well.  It was like me lie.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Let's crank up some Hendrix and smoke some pot.  Oh, well.  Who cares?  We're over here for another year.  We're going to have to go up to the radio show like Ron Kovic's one day in a wheelchair.  Yeah.  And apologize.  I think we're the one who ruined your show.  You still want to do Jocktober?  Hell yeah, we want to do Jocktober.  Who are we focusing on today, Sam?  We could get some clips from the People's Morning Show.  Yeah, I want to hear what that's all about.  The People's Morning Show.  That's in Harrisburg, I think.  Yeah.  Harrisburg, PA, has a show called The People's Morning Show. 
[00:32:30]  Get it, PMS?  It's pretty good.  Yeah, because everyone makes up on the wrong side of the bed.  They're miserable, but the PMS show's going to take care of you.  Yeah, they do.  They're pretty good.  That's what it's about.  Do they have cute little sweepers and stuff?  Yes, they have sweepers to intro their segments.  I'll print it out.  They have a whole list of special vocabulary that just those who really get the show are going to really.  They're not doing the Lope Wiser type crap, are they? 
[00:33:00]  No, nothing like that.  It's totally different.  It's worse, right?  Are we going to be happy?  Yeah.  All right, good.  I'm reading a pal talk here, and some guy with a name that's just unpronounceable says,  you guys just bombed Japan without Pearl Harbor ever happening.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty much it.  That's what we'd do.  Could someone call for us and say we're sorry?  Hell no.  We never say sorry. 
[00:33:30]  Send over a fruit basket.  No, no sorry.  On my behalf, not their behalf.  No.  All for Jim Norton only.  We did what we did.  He also gave out the phone numbers and emails.  Oh, God, we did.  Oh, what idiots.  You know they got blank pictures that they're kind of going through.  Oh, are we terrible?  See, that's what we, I'm sure one of the guys over there is enjoying that, so.  Oh, God, why did we do that?  Why?  There's no reason for us to do that.  Oh, God, we're the worst. 
[00:34:00]  Nice.  All right, Sam, so when are we doing Jocktober today?  Next break, hopefully?  Yeah, definitely.  You're going to be ready?  Oh, yeah.  All right, good.  We're going to focus on the PMS show.  I can't wait.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Sarah Palin, you got the big debate tonight.  Yes.  Oh, boy, is everybody waiting for this one.  We're all excited, which means it's going to be a bust.  You know that, right?  It never works out the way you want it to.  A lot of people are going to be tuned in, though, I'll tell you that much.  You're going to be watching two robots that aren't going to acknowledge each other. 
[00:34:30]  That's what these debates have turned out to be.  Didn't Obama not even look at McCain or something like that?  McCain didn't look at Obama.  Like, they don't even look at each other anymore.  They're asked a question, and then somehow their whole job is to seg the question into what  they want to talk about.  Yeah.  Nothing gets done with these debates.  It's almost like two guys doing speeches on their own in the same room.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all it is.  And rumor has it Sarah Palin is going to have, like, an earpiece, and she's going to be fed  answers. 
[00:35:00]  Sarah Palin is not going to answer anything.  She's incapable of answering a question that is posed to her.  She gets asked something and then seems to have no clue and completely changes the subject.  Yeah.  So, what's the weather out today?  Did you hear about the steel industry?  Yeah.  What?  Wait.  She's asking about the weather.  She's a dummy.  Can you have an earpiece and get fed answers? 
[00:35:30]  Well, they speculated that's what was happening with Bush in the last series of debates with  Kerry.  And there were a whole bunch of conspiracy theories about the lump in his coat and all that.  I want to say that's just one of the rumors going around.  I have no effing idea.  And couldn't they make it wireless?  I mean, they probably could put something in your ear that you wouldn't see with a camera.  Why can't they just have the two candidates, here you are, go?  Why does it have to be so organized and questions and everything has to be timed out?  Let these guys fight it out. 
[00:36:00]  Let them debate.  Well, a good moderator calls them out on their crap.  A good moderator will stop.  Because they are evasive asses.  They never get to the point.  Right.  So a good moderator will go, well, yeah, well, what about what I just asked you?  Who's moderating this one?  This woman who's biased.  She's Gwen Ifill.  Yeah, she's a black woman who's writing a book about Obama, a positive book that comes  out.  Holy Jesus.  Why is she moderating?  I don't know.  Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  No, you're right.  Why is she exactly that?  Yes!  Well, there's no, there's not, Drudge Report had it yesterday, and there's no real outrage  that she wrote an Obama book that she can be the moderator. 
[00:36:30]  A pro-Obama woman is moderating this.  It should be a completely neutral person.  What a bunch of crap.  No outrage.  This sucks.  We're all watching Dance with the Stars and all these other dumb shows.  Where's the outrage?  There's no outrage.  Right here, apparently.  I'm outraged.  I don't need anyone else to be outraged.  I was so disappointed by the Obama-McCain debate.  The same thing's going to happen tonight.  Like Jimmy said, they're just giving speeches in the same room.  Just taking turns doing their speeches. 
[00:37:00]  We need more moments like that, like John Kerry coming out and reporting for duty.  Yeah.  I'm John Kerry, reporting for duty.  Salute.  When these guys go off, when they go off script, is there anything better?  They're just tools.  Yeah.  Well, this is the latest on Sarah Palin.  She can't even answer the simple question, what magazines and newspapers do you read?  That seems like an easy one.  If you were asked, what magazines, what newspapers do you read?  Right.  I'm asking. 
[00:37:30]  We're playing.  On the weekends, I actually attempt the New York Times, my friend.  During the week, I read these cartoony papers, because they're more funny for the radio show,  the Post and the Daily News.  They're very cartoony and stupid.  Because if I'm staying at a hotel, I'll read the USA Today that comes in.  No, you're looking at pictures.  I like Popular Mechanics.  I like the graph.  Yeah.  She won't confess what she read.  What does she read?  NRA Magazine.  She reads, Blubber Monthly, and How to Block Up the Electrical Sockets. 
[00:38:00]  In a magazine on how to put teddy bears over the electrical sockets so the tones don't wind up in there.  Oh, jeez.  See, this.  To Mrs.  Oh, Moe Haircut Monthly.  Bold Do Monthly.  To Mrs. Palin.  See, if you don't answer the question, people are going to answer it for you.  Yeah, make fun of you.  Yeah.  Katie Kerr.  It could be the easiest question ever.  What newspapers do you read?  What if she said Black Inches? 
[00:38:30]  It just slipped out.  Honcho.  Did you say Black Inches?  Black Inches, yeah.  Katie Kerr's having a field day with this Sarah Palin.  Oh, yeah.  Is it all one interview, or does this dope just keep going back to Katie Kerr for another beating?  Retarded boomerang just keeps coming back, sitting down, and getting smashed again.  Is that what's happening, or is it just all from the one interview, and they have so much,  they're just giving you a little piece here and a little piece there?  Well, this is how it went down.  I was curious. 
[00:39:00]  What newspapers and magazines did you regularly read before you were tapped for this to stay informed?  I've read most of them, again, with a great appreciation for the press, for the media.  What ones specifically?  I'm curious.  All of them, any of them that have been in front of me over all these years.  I have a vast variety of sources where we get our news to.  Alaska isn't a foreign country where it's kind of suggested, it seems like, wow, how could you keep in touch with what the rest of Washington, D.C. may be thinking and doing when you live up there in Alaska? 
[00:39:30]  Believe me, Alaska is like a microcosm of America.  This is a joke, right?  Is it only frozen?  This whole Sarah Palin thing is a joke, right?  Like we said earlier, Americans should be pissed that this is our choices.  Yeah.  It's complete BS.  McCain took, obviously, he took advice on this woman, and it was bad advice, and she's a dumbbell. 
[00:40:00]  She's a dumbbell.  Let me answer, what newspapers did you read before you were, make something up, the Anchorage Herald.  I think that's what I was reading.  I think Stump Brain said it, like, she can't answer the question because she doesn't read newspapers and magazines, because let's say she goes, okay, obviously, if I should say Time, Newsweek, the New York Times, if she says, let's say, the New York Times, then the follow-up question is, well, you know, what columnist?  Or what, right?  Yeah.  They would get a little more specific, and then she'd be caught in a lie that she doesn't read the New York Times or what other examples she gives. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, she sucks.  She really sucks.  They all suck, though, Jimmy.  That's my point today.  But she is just, she can't even fake it.  Well, she's trying to fake it.  Just make up a newspaper.  Make up an Anchorage.  What's your big newspaper in Gnome or Juneau?  That's all we know about Alaska.  In Anchorage, that's it. 
[00:41:00]  Anchorage, Juneau, Gnome.  Gnome.  Blubber, Eskimos.  Why do we contribute nothing?  The Bering Straits.  Sure.  Gazette.  Okay.  That's what I read.  I read the Bering Straits Gazette.  Into the Wild.  The Midnight Sun.  What could be on there?  The Midnight Sun, right?  Because it's dark there.  And so on there, because they don't know when to sleep.  When it's light out all the time, it's a little hard to sleep.  She probably reads a great article in the paper, How to Hang Yourself in an Igloo. 
[00:41:30]  That's what all of them should be thinking about in that dumb state.  Just amazing, right?  That's today's Sarah Palin.  Also, we got the audio of her doing the talent portion of her fine 1984 pageant.  Really?  You want to just take a little listen to this?  What did she do?  What was her talent?  I think she played, Danny, did she play the flute or something?  No way.  She's playing the flute.  Toot-dee-doo.  Toot-dee-doing.  She's toot-dee-doing.  That's her talent. 
[00:42:00]  Good for her.  She is an accomplished floutist who has been performing for 10 years.  She will be playing The Homecoming as written by Haygood Hardy and arranged by Sarah's favorite  artist, James Galloway.  Ladies and gentlemen, contestant number eight, Sarah Heath.  Thank you.  Totally dumb.  I'm going to play with her. 
[00:42:30]  I'm going to jam with her.  You're going to play with her?  Sarah Palin.  I'm going to play with Sarah Palin.  The possible vice president?  Praise the то-dee-doing.  Thank you.  I'm going to play with Sarah Palin.  Mike.  Thank you.  I'm going to be fine.  Yeah, she should have stuck to blowing into an instrument. 
[00:43:00]  Apparently, uh, look at her lead paint chip dispensers, she's eating out of, look at her 
[00:43:30]  eyes when she blows into the flute, they get all big and weird.  She gets fisheye.  They almost get cross-eyed.  That's what Mr. Palin gets to see.  Apparently, one time, uh, he didn't.  Oops.  Are we done with this?  Sounds like the chicken music.  Yeah, the chicken's good, yeah.  Oh, oh.  Oh, the chicken. 
[00:44:00]  Ah, it's good, yeah.  It sucks.  Are you really, Homer?  It sucks.  Hear the chicken objecting?  Loudly.  Oh, wait.  This is going great. 
[00:44:30]  All right, enough.  Oh, God.  That's her talent.  Enough.  What's it going for?  I guess that long.  All right, there you go.  Right to the end.  Wonderful.  Yeah, here's the chicken.  Here's the famous chicken audio.  Yeah.  I love this.  It's good.  Yeah.  There's horrific things going on in this video, yes.  Play along at home.  Guess what's happening to the chicken.  It's not a happy chicken. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, that's good.  Yeah, like.  Like.  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  You know, when a German and a chicken get together with a camera.  Oof.  Germans are undefeated in that area.  Yeah.  Chickens never won.  I'm convinced that.  It just goes to show you what Jimmy says about just conquered nations, you know, that have  been conquered in World War. 
[00:46:00]  Japan and Germany have the creepiest porn.  The creepiest, most degenerate form of pornography ever.  Self-flagellation.  I'm telling you, self-flagellation.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  They just have to humiliate themselves because they were so humiliated in front of the world.  Chickens cry.  They certainly do.  That chicken was.  Chickens cry.  This is what it sounds like.  When chickens cry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good, that's chicken.  Maybe I'm just like the rooster. 
[00:46:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  I might have something here.  This is how.  Yeah.  He come to the rooster.  You know exactly when things start to happen.  Like the chicken's objecting.  He's probably like, put me down.  This is not comfortable.  I want to run around in the yard for a bit.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Where you putting that, son?  All right.  We're going to take a break.  It sucks with not having our phones.  We don't feel connected to our listeners today.  Good.  It's fun.  I'll take a day off from those idiots any day.  Yeah.  They look what they did to us yesterday.  We attacked these people in Utah.  We did nothing.  Yeah.  For nothing.  They did nothing but a free commercial for satellite radio.  We brutalized them.  I'm proud of what we did yesterday.  Are you?  I am proud. 
[00:47:30]  Why?  They seem like nice enough people.  Oh, nice folks.  Whatever.  Having fun with their thumbs up.  Actually.  We'll make them tougher people.  Toughen them up?  We'll toughen them up, sure.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to do Jack-tober.  You can't wait.  We do that after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Do, do, do, do, do.  Can't give the phone number out yet. 
[00:48:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  Hey, you got the Red Sox beating the Angels last night.  A little acknowledgement, people.  4-1.  Baseball still being played?  Phillies over the Brewers.  3-1.  And then you got the Joe Torre Dodgers.  I know we're being hurt in Boston, but how great would it be if the Dodgers win it all?  How great would it be?  And I hate the Dodgers, but I'm a fan of Joe Torre.  Joe Torre would be, yeah, very happy. 
[00:48:30]  They beat the Cubs last night.  And speaking of baseball, Chase Stadium, three days after the final game, you can't even recognize the place.  Wow.  Really?  They are not waiting.  Now, meanwhile, Yankee Stadium, they've reopened it for people to come in and pay their last respects and tribute.  Oh, really?  And to go, yeah.  So if you're a fan, you can go down to Yankee Stadium during certain times and walk around in the outfield. 
[00:49:00]  You can get a tour of the place.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  See all the monuments.  And, you know, just be there in Yankee Stadium, the sacred ballpark.  And, Shea, rip it apart.  I don't think the rest of America understands what's going on here.  You got the two stadiums, their final year.  And, yeah, like Ant just described, very different how they're handling it.  Yeah.  You know, like the, what are they, archaeologists, where they take out their toothbrushes and they're carefully getting the fossil out of the ground? 
[00:49:30]  A little paintbrush.  Right.  Whoosh-a, whoosh-a, whoosh-a.  Right, right, right, right.  Whoosh-a, whoosh-a, right.  No, they're just taking a spade shovel and just digging away.  Right.  They just buried, Shea Stadium, where they would, like, old civilizations, and just put, like, pavement over it.  Lava.  Just put lava on it.  Leave it like Pompeii.  It's a sinkhole now.  Well, they couldn't wait to get at that prep hole that is Shea Stadium.  So when are they going to start knocking Yankee Stadium down?  I don't know.  Next year or something. 
[00:50:00]  It's going to take almost two years.  Yeah, they're not messing.  They want to really take their time and make sure they do the right thing.  Oh, so that way they could sell every bit of it.  Yeah, they're absolutely going to make millions off the old stadium.  Yes, Travis.  Yeah, it's going to take, like, three years to get Yankee Stadium down because they're systematically removing piece by piece.  And all that's left of Shea is the pitcher's mound.  That's it.  You see, in the Daily News, there's a picture of Shea Stadium.  They're literally taking a chainsaw to things and just, you know, hacking into them. 
[00:50:30]  Not very sacred.  He's just sawing things apart.  Yeah, and you know at Yankee Stadium, they're just going to be unscrewing everything very carefully.  Yeah, numbering and saving the screw.  Right, right.  This was screw number six million.  Who wants to buy it?  Like, the sports fans win in the end because every sports bar in the New York area is going to have a piece of Yankee Stadium in it.  A piece of Yankee Stadium.  Every person will.  Yeah, they're just going to have it.  It's going to just be everywhere, spread out.  Bricks.  You know, it's a brick from Yankee Stadium.  You can display in your home.  Yeah.  All right, so that's going on. 
[00:51:00]  And then, we like to do this because, you know, we all know that time sucks and your life is just flying by.  Tick tock.  Today's example that life is moving way too fast.  Mm-hmm.  Guess how old old Tiffany is.  Tiffany.  We all remember Tiffany.  I'm sure.  She remade the locomotion.  Not many of us were fans of Tiffany, but if you knew anything about pop culture, you had this broad singing in the malls.  Tiffany, remember?  Big rivalry between her and Debbie Gibson for a while.  That's right.  A lot of speculation as to who would go on to actually have a career that would last longer, Debbie Gibson or Tiffany. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, and now.  I see a similar thing between Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera popped up.  Right.  These come up every few years, but Tiffany was the red-haired one.  And don't go for the goof.  How old do you really think Tiffany is today?  I don't even.  What was her song?  I don't remember who she is.  I think we're alone.  I think we're alone now.  Yeah, I think we're alone now.  Yeah.  You don't know who Tiffany is?  I'm sure I do if I heard.  She was the mall broad, Jimmy.  It was a great marketing strategy. 
[00:52:00]  She just started playing in the malls.  Yeah.  And she was packing out malls all over the place.  Oh, it's a horrible song.  I think it's...  But this was the rage for about six months.  Yeah.  How old do you think Tiffany is, Anthony?  Let's see.  Don't go for the goof.  You're a professor.  No, I'm trying to figure this out.  You're a professor.  Come on.  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Let me think.  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  Hold on. 
[00:52:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  I know this.  Oh, you're doing math.  Yeah.  I can see you're doing math.  Yeah, I'm trying to do a little math, but I have no idea what the actual dates are.  Oh.  I'm going to say...  80?  37.  I'm going to say 41.  Why do you cheat?  What?  Because I can?  Did you cheat?  Yeah, the age was in the other closet. 
[00:53:00]  I was cheating.  Tiffany's 37.  Wow, I got it right.  She was just a little thing.  Thank you, multiple Migs.  Thank you, Captain Baldy.  Multiple Migs.  I know.  He threw the answer at you.  Yes.  He landed in your hair.  He landed in my hair.  F all your friends on Pal Talk.  We're trying to entertain the people here, you dopes.  But she was just a little tiny little teenager.  I know.  Now she's 37 years old. 
[00:53:30]  And the Loot Man is 57 today.  Oh, 57 Sting?  Sting is known as the Loot Man.  Yeah, he did that thing with the police, but we all know him for playing the Loot.  Decided to bring back an instrument that we buried, what, 300, 400 years ago.  Can we get our Loot audio today?  One of our favorite things to do is Sting and his Dumb Loot.  And Don McClain, American Pie.  Is he dead?  I thought he was dead.  He's still relatively young, considering that song's been around for 40 some odd years, it seems. 
[00:54:00]  63.  All right, it's Jocktober.  Jocktober.  That's what we do.  We don't have Rocktober.  And we already gave a tribute to E-Rock.  Yeah.  You want to explain what Jocktober's all about?  Jocktober.  We're going to be featuring other radio shows.  It's a little odd for a radio show to feature the talents of other radio shows, because people 
[00:54:30]  in radio, they don't really like acknowledging other shows, because they don't want people  to start listening to them.  You don't want your own ratings to go down.  But we're so confident during Jocktober that these shows...  We're so confident with the crap we throw at you every morning.  Yeah.  This crap, this garbage, that during Jocktober, we have no problem with showcasing a different  show every day.  Well, for the next few days until we get bored.  Or lazy, or whatever we do, and just stop doing it. 
[00:55:00]  And then people go, what happened in Jocktober?  What?  Oh, yeah, remember that?  Let's do it.  And when we say remember that, we forgot that we did it the day before.  Of course we did.  We're just the worst.  God, we should be somebody else's Jocktober feature.  And then you got...  Stink.  And then Jocktober turns into Cocktober later on in the afternoon, because then our listeners  decide to email pictures of big roosters all over the place.  That's right.  So today, this is Sam's bid. 
[00:55:30]  Sam, you brought us a show called The People's Morning Show.  Yes.  The People's Morning Show.  Oh, wait.  We got an official sweeper for Jocktober.  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  I want to rock!  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation of ours.  I'm wearing panties to this party.  I've never seen a better antonym of hysterical. 
[00:56:00]  Crank up the crapola, it's Jocktober on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It was the yang for the yin hysterical.  It was the polar opposite.  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  I like Steve doing the hacky morning zoo voice, too.  Sounds like Steve taking one minute of audio and just pulling two clips out of it.  Yeah.  Right.  Yes.  The whole segment.  That's the brilliance of his production. 
[00:56:30]  To be fair, that was Derek's lazy work.  Oh, wow.  Derek's throwing his hands up in the air somewhere now.  Exactly.  With his dumb glasses.  We have people working for this show like everywhere.  Where are half these people?  I don't know.  We've got people in Washington.  Where are these people?  No, we've got people that are serious.  We've got people a block away.  They're just in rooms somewhere making believe they're doing something because they don't  have a boss.  So we've got the People's Morning Show today.  Yeah.  Well, the People's Morning Show advertised themselves as intellectual and irreverent. 
[00:57:00]  Oh.  So I was sitting there and I'm like, so I'm going to get to laugh and also it's going  to give me something to think about.  A little thinking, a little laughing.  That's a dream of a program director.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  So I was sitting there, you know, this is going to be a good jocktober for me.  Okay.  Yeah.  And so, yeah, I brought some clips of what I thought was the most irreverent and intellectual  things that they did this morning.  All topics for all people, intellectual and irreverent look at the day's news from the  viewpoint of the people. 
[00:57:30]  That's why it's the People's.  Oh.  That's just like a Thomas Jefferson quote.  And it's hosted by Nipsey, Earl, Jen Shade.  Jen Shade, the whole?  Yes.  Nipsey, Earl, and Jen Shade.  Jen Shade would be today's home.  Does she disappoint as being the whole or is she like following the...  You know, we set the bar so high with yesterday's whole.  Oh, no.  We really did kind of blow it by putting her on first.  Oh.  Yeah.  But, I mean, she's still a whole.  And they got, what, talk the talk? 
[00:58:00]  What is this?  They're coming up with their own lingo or something?  Yeah, they like the vocabulary words.  So they have three pages of single-spaced words with explanations as to what everything  is.  And this is, these they use all the time, I guess.  I guess so.  There's something else going on, too.  Yuck.  They're starting at these morning shows.  It's kind of like the Sunny D commercial.  It's like right out of central casting.  They got the black guy.  Yeah.  They got the rock chick. 
[00:58:30]  Yes.  And the all-purpose white dude with the sports cap on.  Right?  Yeah, that's exactly what this show is.  Wow, really?  I didn't see a picture of them.  I need to know what they look like.  Yeah.  Just Google the people's show.  Where are they looking at, Sam?  Central Pennsylvania.  Harrisburg.  PA.  Well, Nipsey introduces Jen's News, then makes a reference to being intimate with a black  woman for some reason.  Who's Nipsey?  The black dude?  No, Nipsey is the white guy.  He's kind of the- 
[00:59:00]  What?  How could the white guy be-  Nipsey?  Everyone knows Nipsey is-  It's very irreverent.  That's irreverent right there.  Earl's the black guy?  Yes, believe it or not, Earl is the black guy.  And Jen Shade is the white girl.  See, there's the picture.  Look at her Jen.  She's a rock chick.  Ah, yeah.  She doesn't take nothing from anyone.  Wait, that's her in the middle?  Yeah, she doesn't take guff.  She's horrendous.  Yeah.  Oh, look at her look, though.  You know, you don't mess with her.  Little 80s.  Something else she doesn't take the morning after pill.  No one bangs her. 
[00:59:30]  What a monster.  All right, without hearing a peep out of them, we're off.  We're off and running.  Oh, she's horrendous.  She looks like the bassist in every 80s, like, little hairband.  She looks like Stephen Carr.  Yeah, I think the Toadies had a monster like that in their band.  Remember the Toadies?  Around the lake.  And just so no one's confused, these people, it said zero about Opie and Anthony.  We're just sort of, we're just looking at them today. 
[01:00:00]  Well, it's October, so we've given ourselves a reason to do this without needing them to  really, see, we could beat up on other shows now without them having to even mention us.  Right.  October.  Hey, why is Michael Anthony from Van Halen doing a radio show with two guys?  That's what she looks like.  That's really good.  All right, well, here we go.  Nipsey introduces Jen's news, and he's the white guy, and he's talking about how he was  intimate with a black woman.  Well, yeah, it's like a joke about being intimate, which I think. 
[01:00:30]  Wow, did Earl comment on that, because he's a black guy?  No, Earl knows this place.  Oh, wow.  Of course he does.  I like this.  Where is this from?  Where is this town?  Here we go.  Where are they out of?  Harrisburg.  The People's Morning Show.  Jocktober.  And to my right, the lovely bad dad, we're in kind of hard!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  News from the X-Files with Jen Shade.  You okay there, sir?  Bandana?  I like the way that looks.  Nice look about you today.  I was in a hurry.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:01:00]  Sweet as always, Miss Shade, you look wonderful.  And the darker hair, Jen, I don't know, it's making me feel a little criffy over here.  The black and the berry, the sweet of the juice, baby!  I don't know what the hell has to do anything with it.  Juice.  Where did you come from?  What planet?  What planet?  all right what all i know is there was a lot of energy there for some reason well you gotta have  energy if you're doing a morning show but it's like wasted energy yeah it's like sitting in 
[01:01:30]  your driveway in neutral and just gassing it like you know unless it's in drive and you're  pointing your car somewhere you have a direction it's it's a little uh trick they do it with  morning radio this is what you do go to a park today and just run around in circles like crazy  but don't really do anything you're gonna have people stop and look at you sure they're gonna  go wow something has to be happening here because look at this energy that's going on everyone's  looking right there's a bunch of energy it's true because the jokes aren't funny nor do they make 
[01:02:00]  any sense how about i don't even know what they were doing there just shouting there was a joke in  there well the darker the berry the sweet and a lot of a lot of laughing that's very genuine yes oh  yeah oh the darker the berry the sweeter the juice so that was normally yeah but i guess  talking about banging a black broad you would say something like that right yeah but she said she  dyed her hair a darker color i listened to the clip like six times so i guess it is addicting yeah  she darkened her hair well the first the first joke is coming in because now people are finding the 
[01:02:30]  pictures of this uh people's morning show and uh if you're if you do the instant feedback from your  cell phone a little advice you got to put your name so you get a little credit we like giving credit on  this show yeah uh unlike other radio shows uh jen belongs behind a shade oh oh that's not very nice  all right let's continue with the uh the people's morning show fat cory feldman  uh it looks like jen's shade combed her hair with a effing brick oh they didn't waste any time on 
[01:03:00]  instant feedback uh all right here we go jen talks about the economy oh okay this is one of the all radio  shows talking about the big topics the sarah palin and the economy are two hot hot button topics what  they do is jen will bring up it with the hot news story and then earl and nipsey will kind of just riff 
[01:03:30]  you know riff on the story yeah so this part would be the more irreverent part and no what would this  be i think it's both it's supposed to be irreverent and intellectual because it's all right so this  would be intellectual when she says it and then they go irreverent some kind of satire joke so you  could think and all right well i love i love how you label this sam this is one my favorite part of  the bit jen talks about the economy nipsey and earl try to make it funny and or interesting they fail 
[01:04:00]  wow fail gets the fail tag danny found it she's uh with darker hair she's ozzy on the uh shot in the  dark and his ultimate sin tour you're right wow does that look just like her that's great  should be throwing a dove in the air this fat ugly blood and once again we're not going to be  invited to the rnr convention what are we doing we want to be accepted sure we do here we go 
[01:04:30]  100k to 250 000 most recent versions expected to go back to the house for another showdown this week  good all right the fdic thing sure will help me a lot i'm happy about that thank you very much  i'm still lost modified bill okay here you go i went to uh uh the bank to uh cash check yesterday  and they gave me money so i was pretty much happy uh for the day i don't know what today's going to  bring though they just look at you and go sorry i don't have any no then that's his smile  they should have a writer the riffing is not good no the riffing wasn't really 
[01:05:00]  riffing i went and got cash checked today so that was good wow yeah those were the jokes  they weren't those were their jokes i guess apparently they were saying that they don't  make enough money where the fdic uh change would make a difference it's not a good idea to do fdic  jokes no call me crazy dic jokes are fine yeah of course i got it maybe not i got it 
[01:05:30]  i got it all right well you know it still sounds like that even without the other letter yeah  all right yeah should we continue or this is a rough one sam well they're tough to listen to i know  all right let's go with three jen talks about the uh debate no no another hot button time very very  you did a little debate thing earlier right who's that who's that the guy we're teasing  are you kidding no is that earl are you kidding that's off the myspace it looks like all right 
[01:06:00]  look mighty earl is strapping what is he doing i have no problem with this show why don't we just  stop now and play some skinnerd and go home he's got an eight pack he's ripped  big long hands too or else i catch that's compensating for something yeah that's a that's  too much working out all right uh jen talks about the debate nipsey tells another uninteresting story  about the chinese buffet it's where they get intellectual all right they're expecting 65 
[01:06:30]  percent of registered voters to watch this debate okay it's going to be very very very big could be  bigger than the presidential debate i think it's gonna be somebody asked me in the chinese buffet if i  was registered to vote yesterday you're registering at the buffet i apparently so she said to ask me  if i was registered i guess while she was getting her buffet yes i said well yes i am did she know  who you were no no no no wow so it's getting to be like that that's actually interesting yeah right  off the street yeah it's kind of interesting that people take a a personal interest because it's kind 
[01:07:00]  of a oh it's not a personal thing but still it's it's it's odd but conversation for people that don't  know each other i said you miss i am yeah did you hand me those tongs please i'm gonna get me a  couple uh yes chinese donuts yes yes i am now you're now move out of where you're blocking them  little corns  i am i didn't get it all this corn the little corn right okay oh oh it did a chinese buffet little 
[01:07:30]  corn joke oh yeah because but because they have those little tiny corn on the cobs so but then  what and she asked for who he's voting for and he wanted corn on the cob i can't it's a person  there's a person stranded there's a person stranded there's a show there's a show it's stranded i can't  even make fun of it yeah i this is a rough one today sam i told you i mean this is this is what's 
[01:08:00]  out there the guy talking the first guy he's a weird like old-time woman voice yeah like uh  that's how vivian vance probably sounded in the dressing room well earl was on the debate team he  has a hilarious you went back to 1955 yes how did you know what year that was when i love lucy i love  yeah 52 53 gotta guess the early 50s for that one yeah i'd still think vivian vance has two v's and 
[01:08:30]  it's earl was on the debate team he has a hilarious rebuttal here hilarious very funny my junior year in  high school it was required that we actually had to do something as far as our civics class was  concerned so i like to talk so i figured that would be the best thing to be on there um we never really  won and basically all my arguments ended with your mama however um  the gab that i so well sport today thank you very much jennifer uh my rebuttal is your mama 
[01:09:00]  i like that  the hell was that that could have been the fakest laugh a lot of black guys do that man  that over the top the white guy was laughing that was a white guy laughing yeah i apologize to the  black guy there it's the black guy's story the black guy used to say yo mama but didn't he say 
[01:09:30]  didn't he start the laughing thing i think the white guy all right was responding and i love the fact  that she i would love to hear that again because she put some energy in like i like like when he was  saying and and she went uh-huh like she just jumps in like yeah she has let the audience know that  she's the job of the heart my junior year in high school it was required that we actually had to do  something as far as our civics class was concerned what so i like to talk so i figured that would be  the best thing to be on there um we never really won and basically all my arguments ended with your mama 
[01:10:00]  let's all do it  it was just a noise it came out of his mouth there was no joy attached to that sound none  get to get the gab that i so well sport today thank you very much jennifer uh my rebuttal is  yo mama i like that why do you like that what's what yeah how why would you just said it

[01:11:00]  there it is okay uh earl makes that was uh fred flintstone when he was a superhero  how do you know that i watched the flintstone when i was growing up we all did but we didn't  pay that close attention no not that close 
[01:11:30]  close attention all morning now what all morning uh earl makes a really good specific and relatable  movie reference yeah you know we all we do movie references on this show so they do too  you're making fun of their movie right have you ever heard this show the movie references we come  up with well check out this one all right all kinds of weapons yeah that nobody wants to see go into  somebody else's hands it's really us and russian ships both came to help them deal with the some 
[01:12:00]  60 pirate attacks that have followed along the uh the east west shipping that's a lot it was like  something out of a movie where they they didn't there's a movie about that one time where they  somebody stole something you didn't know exactly what they had and it turned out to be something a  bigger deal than what it was yes roots oh boy they picked on their own shit  what's the movie reference i don't know somebody stole something what was the movie reference he  doesn't remember what movie it is oh my god it's just a movie where somebody stole something and it

[01:13:00]  country is made of in terms of this is like eating a bland food where you're just like yeah all right  i'll have a little more like yeah exactly leave it yeah it could go either way it's like uh it's just  terrible it's like the the music in the back is really distracting constant constantly yeah well uh  the show continues to prove how intellectual they are by going nowhere with the conversation jen brings up  mm-hmm all right the last clip thank god yes of uh the pms morning show he said men seem to get 
[01:13:30]  turned on easier in the winter because they see less skin do you find yourself noticing more in the  winter absolutely i i think so yeah i don't know it's all one big blur to me i know exactly what you  mean though mm-hmm that's a good one jennifer i like that yeah that's definitely i don't know that  one i think about that one i don't know he's turned on in general oral david reed oh no they have  nothing you don't have a particular time of year that you find women more interesting oh it's who

[01:22:30]  opie and anthony a lot then their eyes just glaze over thinking about how pathetic small time they  are they just look broken and defeated they glaze over they go yeah i'm here that's half the guys i  started with man oh really yeah it's an awful business is there this we're no money in radio  unless you're like your level right we didn't get in it for the money i mean we're one of the fortunate  ones where you make a good living you did well where you were starting money and young chicks 
[01:23:00]  it's like it's like jazz musicians like 99 of those guys don't really make any money at all except for  you know the occasional miles davis or you know you don't go into radio assuming you're gonna  make a lot of money and you know you do it go into radio assuming you can bang a lot of young broad  well i told you i assumed that everybody in radio was rich right so when i uh first went on uh opie's  show when he was on bab i thought he was rich oh so he goes yeah uh hang out hang out at my house 
[01:23:30]  uh we'll talk about radio and stuff like that and i think the crow was on yeah uh the tv yeah remember  so i pull up and opie just lives in this crap hole oh and i'm thinking well this must be a summer home  or something like it can't be this is it but it was it you were really hoping to drive up to a fine  piece i thought it was gonna be a gate dude that opens up and are you kidding i drive  i swear to you i thought you were like rich you thought he lived where you live now yes wow how 
[01:24:00]  cool is that no i and i was doing manor and i was doing well for myself at the time this was where  in boston oh long island i was actually doing well for myself but like you said they don't you don't  you don't get money until you start getting syndicated or get to new york yeah the good thing  about comedy and showbiz is like during a depression or recession comedians do really well you know like  the golden age of comedy was right after the depression in 29 you know and now we're in  depression you know unfortunately we have ellen degeneres rob schneider and andy dick and they 
[01:24:30]  had the marx brothers laurel and hardy fields and the three stooges so we're pretty screwed on that  level yeah maybe maybe a nice depression is what we need yeah well i yeah for comedy yeah the golden  age of comedy was you know comedians do people you know would would rather go see comedians than to  have a meal in those days to laugh to you know forget their hunger they want to escape right  oh yeah from reality comedians do well during bad times i want to get you back to so what's so bad 
[01:25:00]  about the local radio shows what do they do it's just awful they you know they want to ask me questions  about the puppet and it's just it's just uncomfortable does george fly with you or do you come  separately i know it's like like you know why can't i just do one show that's hot or something  i don't know it just stinks you know they don't know what i do they don't know what to make of me  i'm tired the puppets sleep you know sleeping in my lap it's awful it breaks up my sleep sleep cycle so 
[01:25:30]  i suck friday night can't fall asleep the night before can't fall asleep after the radio show because  you wound up uh hopped up on coffee you know it's just i don't know you paint such a great picture of  the whole the road uh you know by saturday i'm cooking you know so basically thursday through  saturday gig i'm gonna say basically if you're gonna go see auto it's saturday might be your  first pick yeah i don't know maybe you don't want to say that on a on a on a fine radio show i guess  that people listen to it's just it doesn't seem to help you know i mean what are they doesn't draw 
[01:26:00]  people in i draw people from you know being known or if they don't know me they just come into the  club because they go to the club you know how awful is it when you got to do morning and  afternoon press i actually won't do it anymore it's like we got to get up you know do morning  shows and then they got some local crap for you in the afternoon you get your sleep is destroyed  that's the worst when you got to do i told my agent i said my my one requirement is that the  guy in the radio show should see see a tape of me or hear something to know what the hell i do and  then they can like you know like build me up to the audience you know but he doesn't do that 
[01:26:30]  he just radio people are very lazy yeah they won't they don't want to do anything they just want  to get their show over with and get home as quickly as possible maybe go in the jacuzzi oh  drink a few beers exactly uh yeah and then you miss like i had to change flights in chicago to go to  peoria and they changed gates i was sitting at the gate and they changed they they switched gates on me  and i didn't hear the announcement so i'm stuck in in o'hare airport for like six hours after that 
[01:27:00]  and it was just i was really looking forward to just getting to the hotel watching tv getting  room service and get sacking out early i was so pissed if there is there's one thing that makes  you feel like a kid that missed the bus for school it brings back that same feeling oh yeah it's missing  your plane oh i felt like for whatever reason they switch the gate on you like that i was gonna take  a cab from but it would it would have been like you know a big chunk of my salary yeah you know  and the guy you know they would have thought i was retarded you have to wait all night or just like 
[01:27:30]  like from like no but it's like i was i already got to the airport you know it was a two-hour layover  so i was already there two hours and they switched the gate on me they said they made an announcement  but i you know i didn't have headphones on i was reading if i heard peoria i would have focused and  tuned into the announcement they i don't i don't believe they made an announcement at all they just  switch gates they suck it's funny you sound like bogart now at the end of uh the cane mutiny i said there  was an announcement but i don't know there wasn't i know there wasn't i would have oh god 
[01:28:00]  someone how many portions did you have not a big fan of the road i don't um well when a flight goes  good you know i mean the the gigs yeah i mean i i don't mind the road it's just you know that kind  of stuff is just sucks there's nothing you can do at that point when the stupid radio shows yeah  are you following the election um yeah kind of i mean it's it's all a sham whoever gets elected is  just gonna do what they're told i mean after the kennedys were whacked out uh there's no more 
[01:28:30]  um chance of any kind of a change you know but obama is all about the change you're not buying  into the no why should you believe that a guy who's who made it this far in politics is not  completely full of crap and is going to just betray everything he says of course he is why are  they going to why would they keep their word i'm with you they have so many people around them too  like you know when jfk stepped into that oval office and had his advisors come in there they  uh it wasn't like they were telling him what to do he's like here's what i want to do now you guys 
[01:29:00]  figure out how it's done you know and and that's it we will go to the moon before the end of the  decad what yeah uh go to the moon and those other things he actually says that and those other things  before the end of the decad he was a great speaker right he's riveting yeah how could you have a voice  like that and and like people actually paid attention they said if he wasn't saying anything  good you just go who is this idiot they said he got a piece of tail right before his debate with 
[01:29:30]  nixon that's why he was all relaxed relaxed yeah and nixon's like backed up for a year  sweating i need sex i need sex yeah you know waterfall on his just falling from his that was  just some forehead that was some pre leaking out of his head i actually he needed a good release  coming out of his forehead went to dab it with a hanky and it just kind of like a little spittle  he cursed a lot you know all those tapes of him oh i love that it's great he's the most racist 
[01:30:00]  anti-semitic and he's just talking about henry henry henry my jew get me out of nom henry he was a  horrible person you're a jew you know how to talk to people i actually got tackled by the secret  service when nixon really well that's great yeah when nixon was at the statue of liberty i don't know i  must have been like 11 or 12 i went there with my puppet figuring i would get on tv the way they do  at ball games when you hold up a sign at a go getter ball game like the big thumb and you get on tv 
[01:30:30]  i figured i was so i i held my puppet up in the crowd i was i was miles away from nixon but a guy  grabbed me and pulled the puppet out of my hand and just like did a quick look for a pistol because  all he saw was a daddy o day popping up all the crowd probably had a rifle in there or something  but they it's great those guys like the lee harvey oswald puppet he didn't say that exactly like 
[01:31:00]  them yeah technically a conspiracy because it was two but one was a puppet those guys don't hurt you  they just like secure you like they grab you they secure you they make sure you don't move they check  you out and then they just they don't say anything they just move on that's great it was cool they  don't injure you at all well because you were 11 yeah but you know that's if you were 30 with a  puppet really you would have got roughed up a little bit yeah i was very eager in those days to just  i i brought the puppet everywhere i always figured i was gonna like even if i went to the movies i 
[01:31:30]  would have my dummy i go i don't know what if i run into mel brooks i could do a quick audition on  the street for him you know i was very ambitious you know like lucille ball yeah yeah exactly  trying to get into the booth yeah i thought he'd be telling us during the tonight show someday  thank god i always brought the puppet johnny yeah that's a great take on the election though  you got there oh what about this sarah palin she's pretty dumb oh she's as dumb as a bag of hammers  idiotic she really is adult yeah she is she can't even fake it well yeah being a politician our point 
[01:32:00]  today is uh really simple i mean he could very possibly die and then she'd be president right did you hear  she's a 72 year old a heartbeat away from the president all right we heard it 8 000 times oh god  enough with your cliches on the news and that's not gonna happen look at dick cheney that that guy's  health problems were way worse than mccain's yeah and he made eight years yeah we don't know where he 
[01:32:30]  is these days he might not have made eight years yeah who knows presidents used to always be really old  dudes though yeah kennedy and clinton kind of ruined that and made it you know like it could be like a  young guy getting tail you know so look at like lbj or eisenhower yeah those guys the old bitter men  yeah yeah they're just old guys that just want to you know send tanks in somewhere yeah exactly about  the tanks our point is uh that americans should be pissed that this is our choices this time around oh 
[01:33:00]  yeah i don't care if you're a democrat or republican there it's all crap what about every single one  vote for him i'm not even voting for any of these liars yeah these lifetime politicians yeah that just  their whole goal from the time they were in school was to be president oh that's gotta be your goal if  you go into politics you always want to attain the pinnacle sure you know the presidency that high  in politics has got to be completely full of crap yes unless they're like bloomberg who i like 
[01:33:30]  even though he annoyed but he's got the only reason he's got his own money so he can't be  bought that's it the guy can't be bought off so he says whatever the hell he wants he gives he gives  comments sometimes where you're like holy jesus is he crazy yeah this guy's got like 50 grand in the  bank no one's telling him anything perhaps more than that jim that's why the kennedys were you know  they actually thought they had the power of the presidency but there is no power you do what you're told  or you get you know whacked out in a motorcade you know yeah they weren't going to be told 
[01:34:00]  anything with the kennedys they had they had the money too right yeah from the age of one year old  there we go you're a kennedy you can do it bang as many women as you want and do whatever you want  you're a kennedy they were told that yeah you know but when you're you know you do what you're told  even as president when it comes to ending a war and stuff like that jesus can i still bang  women yeah right but i'm the president it doesn't matter you're a kennedy he had a really bad back  from pt one all that all the pt 109 floating on a coconut that's why he didn't fall down in the 
[01:34:30]  limo when the first bullet ripped through his throat he would have collapsed but he was being  held up by a back brace you notice in that footage oh god that's why his arms were so awkward yeah he  was like this he's got like an ironing board glued to his back he made them fall over and that's  that's why his head got blasted he made that move like private pile did when he tried to choke  himself at first his arms went up and just looked real stupid my hand i'm nuts  yeah because it does look so awkward you can see that's why his jacket was that's why you know 
[01:35:00]  oswald did it right that's why his jacket was up higher he knew he was being killed he had those  second or two to think about it with martin luther king it was just a bullet in the spot in the face  and then he never knew anything you know why didn't they make that stupid back brace out of  like kevlar yeah well back in those days oh they didn't have that no i just think it was two pieces  of metal tied around like i said oh my god just sketches glued to his back oh go get the brains 
[01:35:30]  jackie there she goes like scooping up a huge hit bits yeah hey i gotta clear it up again every day  we gotta clear it up uh today it's lon in uh georgia we're making fun of biden  we're making fun of biden we have made fun of biden are we liberal idiots again it's all  liberal direct we're giving you but they don't hear i mean the fact is is there's way more sarah  palin audio for us to goof on hey lon we'll make fun of who we want to make fun of if we want to  make fun of this dumb bitch we'll make fun of this dumb make fun of biden he's got uh the arteries

[01:46:30]  just before the show today about the uh the pool uh uh balls in vegas oh yeah i i don't i hate when  people talk about haunted places you know my places huh no it's not yeah you don't believe in the  ghost i don't know my brother swears the place he's living in now is haunted he swears man how's  this creek this thing they shift you know what are you talking about i was staying in vegas when i 
[01:47:00]  was uh we were doing a stardust hotel and that's an old place it's probably a lot of mob hits there  and i was staying because dice didn't use a suite he bought a house in vegas so he gave me the suite  it was the top floor and take the suite i got a house i think the place like anything he says i just  picked him saying it like that yeah he was probably just like yeah take the suite yeah yeah why don't  you just but it's always good  yeah there's ghosts in there it's spooky great impression 
[01:47:30]  what's that there's laughing in the room i'm a scared  so it was uh the top floor was a huge two-bedroom suite but it felt old school yeah and on top of  the uh the top floor there's a pool table and uh i was alone in the suite i was sick and uh 
[01:48:00]  i thought kenny and happy had come back to the room yeah because i i heard the pool balls clanking  thought someone might be shooting a little pool i knew it i knew i heard it i mean it was it was  the clank of pool balls oh my god and uh i went upstairs and there was no i was going up there  and i don't get creeped out that easily but i was really freaked out really really and you still  don't believe in ghosts i had many bad nights in that place as far as sleep is concerned i think i 
[01:48:30]  stopped staying in the suite actually maybe give me another room on the floor uh it just it really  creeped out now we know why dice gave you the suite i believe me he saw all this stuff and said  after that i'm gonna buy a house in this town he's a panicky pete with stuff like that i guarantee  you he felt bad vibes in there i remember he didn't buy a house because then that would be  proof that there's something beyond death you know yeah but that scares me viable it would scare  you i can't have i was saying before i was like if a ghost came up and actually said look calm down 
[01:49:00]  i'm not gonna do anything i i'm just i'm actually gonna give you some answers i'm just here i'm a yeah i'm a  from the afterlife i wouldn't hear that because i'd be going like running like a girl my arms would  be flailing i'd run like jane gum when he was giving the cards to uh what's her name oh jody  foster i got a card right here and then and then the cards just fall out of his hand he runs  stupid mrs lipman senator's fat daughter in the well in the basement moths all over they say the comedy

[01:50:00]  empty he'd hear like conversations in in the ladies room and they and with then they would talk  like in 1940s type you know uh saying slang like that well let me tell you yeah like that i think he's  a bum i don't know if it was grady in the men's room talking about how your son is attempting to  bring an outside party yeah into this situation i correct them a death jam comic  cook the comedy store too is just a dark creepy place to begin with why don't you light light up 
[01:50:30]  the joint it's a comedy very miserable there i know like just little like lights on the table  very unhappy place yeah it's it's like a gloomy yeah it's dark yeah i always bomb there too i gotta  do that so i'm doing a set there i think monday really i can't do the improv because it's black  night at the improv so i'm not gonna face that aggression oh um so i think i'll do the store  and that's what i always bomb there oh really oh who they get to replace you michael richards  where does he come on there oh literal jim 
[01:51:00]  why don't you do the laugh factory maybe i will yeah um it was very creepy being there though man to  be to be honest because uh you know murders are probably committed there because it was a mob  place before they said a lot of stuff happened it was zeroes it was a famous a very famous uh nightclub  yeah yeah well we all ran out of steam at the same moment no i was just pondering i was just  pondering that like what could have gone on during that time where you know why why haunt the place 
[01:51:30]  why are why are chicks in the bathroom talking yeah would they die in there i don't believe any of that  crap it's just stories to me you know i want to stories yeah i just i i haven't seen it so i don't  believe it you know ufos you know probably out there i haven't seen one i'd love to yeah until i see  stuff i'm i'm the biggest skeptic you have to be scientific you can't believe in everybody's  hoopla all that ghost stuff like uh the amityville horror house that is like you know the story came  out the book first which people read it were like oh my god this really happened and then they made 
[01:52:00]  the movie and and then the people that moved in after uh the other people moved out lots  lots after the lots has moved out the green slime was dripping out of the wall it tasted funny it  tasted funny you know running there with a ritz cracker this green slime coming out of there  it would maybe smell it you wouldn't taste it let me taste this stuff that was a scary book though  yeah very scary and the flies all on the wall and everything and the windows and stuff and then uh 
[01:52:30]  the next family moved in was like nothing nothing is happening in this house yeah it's creepy because  ronnie de feo bad boy ronnie i mean you know he murdered his family yeah he murdered his family  heroin addict guy uh we used to take road trips to the amityville heart yeah no house and at night  it was just scary to see from i've never seen it you'd freak yourself out yeah yeah we'd be freaked  out i love halloween i i love all the movies on tv and stuff i get it i enjoy it yeah is it still  there yeah they remodeled it though so it doesn't really look as much like it did like that whole um 
[01:53:00]  the barn side that had that weird window in it that looks like eyes kind of yeah yeah those two windows  those quarter windows yeah they did that because they don't want people they got rid of those just  to this day people are still uh driving by and they finally and that's the image everybody remembers  of the house that side of the house and you couldn't really see it from the road you had to kind of go on  the side of the house to see the part of the house that was really recognizable it was right on the  water it still is you know but but the people that live there go no there's been nothing yeah that 
[01:53:30]  has happened in that house since then jody the pig remember she the girl said she saw jody the pig up in the  window yes hey uh danny what video are we watching this uh we should turn this on to the list right  and creepy we'll link this on onaradio.com but it's a whole montage of possible ghosts it's just a  it's a compilation of like the best uh ghost videos that are out there yeah okay why is the door just  the door just flew up and some of them are like whatever but some of them are extremely creepy you  know what i i it was right at the beginning of those stupid things where they tell you to look at 
[01:54:00]  something and then a real scary face had come up with a noise you get those emailed to you and one  was um look at look at this picture and see if you can um you see like a ghostly image appear in the  chair you have to stare closely and you hear it talking so turn your speakers up and this is before  believe me i i don't fall for those anymore but i'm looking i'm staring at the screen dude i i it felt 
[01:54:30]  like an electric shock went through my body when that face came on and and the the sound got really  loud that is one of the best gags in internet history oh yeah the scare the crap out of you  because you turn the volume up and you're staring at one spot on the screen there is a better one  which one the one we talked oh the boss is us yeah i still don't find that as good but that is a good  one what is this now it's just a montage of just this house that they claim was haunted but again  everything they're doing could be done by it could be done yeah yeah strings it's smoking mirrors i 
[01:55:00]  tell you yeah what's supposed to happen here danny they don't tell you i watch this oh you get a  little something went through the uh went through the frame i mean obviously some of the stuff is  probably is most likely a hoax but there are some really weird weird weird videos that are that's part  of this compilation video it's like a 10 minute video so there's you know there's like 50 yeah we'll link  it up there people could check it out for themselves like the camera movement is creepy 
[01:55:30]  like i i don't know like the ghost is moving the camera oh it's moving by itself but you know i'm not  buying it a bunch of crap old stuff in the 70s listen for a strange sound yeah some some of these  videos it's it's more audible but there's other ones where it's you know that's from the 70s  definitely visual things happening it's not bad video for the 70s what are you doing on halloween  nope me we might throw a party or something yeah why are we i'd like to know because i have a gig  i'll cancel we might throw like a radio show party you know yeah yeah dress up as something silly 
[01:56:00]  i don't dress up actually anthony likes to uh i usually just dress in my renaissance fair um clothing  oh all right we're gonna take a break uh we'll link this video that we're kind of taking a peek at  onaradio.com auto from auto and george autoandgeorge.com but uh cleveland uh improv  end of the Cleveland improv and uh uh halloween night i'll be at the parsippany holiday end the  auto and george halloween ball oh that's gonna be fun costume prizes and all that oh symphony 
[01:56:30]  all right well uh we'll finish next opian anthony  talking with otto from auto and george today on the opian anthony show  otto a huge movie buff sometimes not into the uh the porn as much as just uh checking out an old  flick right i've seen enough but you always have like the best movie references and you watch  you just watch a lot of movies yeah student of film i do i recently not i mean you know that i really 
[01:57:00]  wanted that al pacino movie to be good but that was great was it oh yeah come on it's all  how you look at it otto they used to have some yeah and i borrow george's shoes oh i got little  lifts on my feet who's that al pacino it's the new al pacino yeah god what happened anthony does the  uh the early years i like the early one i like uh see that man over there that's luke abrazzi oh yeah  he works for my father yeah and then what happened all of a sudden he's wow god it's a big practical 
[01:57:30]  joe was it from smoking to yell at movies i had both i don't know he started doing theater acting  on film it was just weird oh yeah yeah yeah i mean that movie was like 87 minutes long uh a crime  drama has to be two hours or better was that 87 minutes not even an hour and a half right it's  like come on it's not a 90 minute channel 11 godzilla movie john leguizamo in it yeah they hate that guy 
[01:58:00]  they're messing up the movies because uh i think stunt brain uh uh turned me on to this the movies  have to be an hour and a 40 or less so they could get an extra showing to make a little more money  oh yeah yeah they're thinking about the bottom dollar constantly now so they're like not showing  more money it's got to be no more than a hundred minutes so it doesn't have to be so the actual film  is about 87 because then you got the uh the previews and all okay but i mean titanic is the  highest grossing movie of all time that was three hours i understand that but you can't for the most 
[01:58:30]  part you can't put three hour movies out well they knew it wouldn't have the formula is they try to do  an hour and uh they had a hundred minutes they had to make as much money quickly as they could because  the word gets out quick that it stinks yeah that's exactly it you didn't like the dark night  i i liked it i didn't think it was great he led you was great oh yeah he was amazing it was a great  i just don't care about superhero crap what about iron man no not i'm tired you watch iron man you  know i'm every performance he does they just say how wonderful robert downey jr is all right 
[01:59:00]  enough of him yeah it's kind of good tropic thunder i i'm not gonna see anything with ben stiller and  freaking uh jack black it was a decent movie very overrated but it was funny right not a big  jack black is quirky though yeah okay oh what a guy what's your problem with ben stiller i  i just think he's a uh he's not funny to me he's not a funny human being he's you know the movies  suck i don't know how about the meet the parents moments though huh well i don't know you know i'll 
[01:59:30]  watch that and i don't think it's anything great meet the parents really wasn't that bad i enjoyed  the first one the second one was comedy the second one was oh and then the other thing about uh  tropic thunder it's like everybody goes well it's it's taking a stab at hollywood it's like it's a  hollywood movie ben stiller's part of hollywood you can't you can't uh lambast yourself that has  to come from an independent or an outsider or the audience you know they were getting they were  getting edgy spoof yes stop it you gotta see tom cruise though yeah is he good in it yes so you 
[02:00:00]  really laughed i mean how many times did you laugh out loud i saw it with uh patrice and bob kelly and  there were yeah we were laughing pretty hard laughing out loud yep i laughed at myself a lot  of that had to do with the company or honestly with your boys you're having a good time honestly  not laughing at uh ben stiller as much no no uh but uh and now he's doing that uh joe piscopo look i'm  got big arms now look at my guns stop it that really makes uh does that make you angry guys funny

[02:32:30]  it just ain't gonna happen over time i don't know what the fucking future holds but uh as of right  now you know i i i'm not gonna hate on anybody but i'm not gonna fucking  give anyone the benefit of the doubt either i'm just gonna play this out i got a job to do i come in  here and i fucking do it i don't have to be friends with anybody or i don't have to be enemies  enemies with uh anybody i'm just doing my fucking job we like to hang out with real people too because  uh now supposedly he's congratulating us but a month or two ago he's like if if they sign opian anthony 
[02:33:00]  then i have to leave this company so so which yeah which bubba should we believe right and i'm not  taking anyone's word for it anymore that calls in i'm just not fucking any fact facts any emails or  anything i'm not i'm and then all of a sudden we're like uh all right and then what and then  he turns on us on us again because he's a he's a fake dude we don't know we don't know who bubba is  no one knows who bubba is he's probably congratulating us because he knows we're a very important part of  this new company and he better shut his fucking trap guys like that just want you to say his name 
[02:33:30]  a lot it doesn't matter if it's in bad or in a good way it's just to get him you know his name out  there there you go that's right otto yeah otherwise why would he pick a fight you guys are bigger  oh bigger i thought we had to dump out of that oh i thought you were saying  uh ron there's no dumping on this side is there  no thanks only when you say bigger with an n oh yeah oh okay  stupid let's say let's say hi to tom in florida tom 
[02:34:00]  hey guys hey there tom hey tom welcome aboard sorry tom you're out  hey bubba for 12 years down in florida kept bitching about howard and saying how he was going  to take him on and kept giving him crap all the time and then he goes to serious and sucks his  cock and now he's doing the same thing to you guys bitches about you when he's at serious now that  he's at xm oh let's be friends let's be got by guys he's a fucking fat hypocrite kind of the point 
[02:34:30]  i'm making you don't know which one to believe i i hate guys like that i'll tell you one thing i  hate guys like off the air that howard and uh robin are very nice people it's just the oddest thing  howard i gotta give uh props to howard he he did something uh two days ago he's showing that he's a  that he's a stand-up guy i don't know how much i could say yet yeah i probably wouldn't say anything 
[02:35:00]  yeah i understand but uh a story was told to me from a very reliable source that uh wow it was a  strong move on howard's part a strong move because in the in the poker room over at um was that where  were we borgata right uh it was really it was totally cool and robin she was i mean on the air we've  fucking said horrific things about each other never take them back it was on the air stuff you know  whatever it was uh but it's just weird it's very fucking weird well our lives have all uh collided 
[02:35:30]  lately and it's uh in this mess of satellite radio i see robin at the gym i've seen her at the gym a  couple times i've seen her just on the street because now she lives in the neighborhood i passed  my ability every day i've never seen her and we all just kind of like you know kind of get along it's  not howard love your asshole shit dick mother fucking kev slider douchebag oh my god kev slider i  know you're a fan what i know you're big but i gotta i gotta set a precedent i gotta set a 
[02:36:00]  fucking president i gotta set a president here first kev slider i'm sorry you're fucking gone there you go  sit out the day sit the fucking day out and i'm tired of it yeah pick on the black guy sorry kev  slider is he black of course he is get him out you can't say anything on pal talk when he's on there  when he comes in the room well half my conversation is gone it's all about saying anything it's all  about slider yeah he he goes enough with the howard love it's like not howard love see this is another 
[02:36:30]  part of just talking honestly on the air do you want us to be fake and phony and carry on a phony  war thing or whatever yeah there's still some hurdles that we'll never fucking get over but  i'm just saying off the air the people seem to be very cool what the fuck is the problem with saying  that go perish the thought you're honest on the air jesus christ good we'll just give you phony radio  how you doing everybody how are things going oh good fantastic yeah everything's going great in my life 
[02:37:00]  too i'm not going to talk about anything relationships nothing we'll talk about  fucking fudge sheets or or anything else you get nothing out of me anymore you get phony  shit i'm enjoying this version more actually yeah yeah it's light-hearted no one gets hurt  you're not doing the fake voice though jimmy yeah i'll tell you this much uh wow gained a gained a lot 
[02:37:30]  of respect what i heard if i say it went down two days ago and that's all i can say right now but  wow it was a strong move on howard's part strong has nothing to do with us by the way no oh and i can't  and and uh suggest that we didn't say no more for now no i wouldn't because i who knows what what  the intent was and if it should be you know confidential or something that's that's his business  i think the intent was uh was uh from a good place yeah i really do not i didn't mean that way i meant 
[02:38:00]  i'm eating a sandwich on the air and it's very rude no it's not you're a fucking you're a  fucking anthony you do what you want man thank you jimmy that a boy i'm you're right  fucking grapefruit we wish somebody would say something i love that grapefruit that's a  park meridian grapefruit is a horrible fruit it's not it's a bitter piece of  it's bitter exactly i don't like bitter i like an orange that size that would be great 
[02:38:30]  but a grapefruit is always bitter isn't it someone agree with me here for god's sake  what happened it's not as bitter as i remember it oh grapefruit it depends you gotta get the pink  grapefruit that's a pink grapefruit you're all right you're fine let's say hi to jeff in ohio jeff  hey you guys hey uh hey there jeff welcome aboard jeff hey i got a uh kind of a question here do you  guys think that it's a hidden underlying motive for uh bubba because he's not gonna get any

[02:51:30]  lieutenant man i mean that's not really an admission of guilt it's true i mean everyone  i work with him he's a great guy he was a great guy and i mean when you got the media sitting  outside your house 24 hours a day taking pictures of you the job's ready to crucify him to make him  a freaking scapegoat for this unfortunate thing that happened yeah i mean matt i want to clear  something up though i i didn't say an admission of guilt or anything i said he was feeling guilt he 
[02:52:00]  was like feeling guilty about what happened you know you got to have some feelings like when  you're second guessing yourself or somebody ends up dead because of your actions i'm sure he was  feeling pretty shitty about it and yeah when the press and uh people start really chiming in on it  without knowing all the facts uh the guy probably couldn't couldn't fucking take it man i mean 49  times out of 50 that guy's gonna fall off that ledge in a fat naked mess and then just get up  and that's the end of it i mean that guy fell the one way on his head yet yeah i mean 
[02:52:30]  it's just it was a stupid unfortunate incident and the guy's life is going to be ruined from it  they're going to take his pension they were going to make the last 22 years of his life worthless  well wait wait they would take his pension for a mistake like that like yeah they were already  they was all ready to do it man they took his gun and shield away they tucked him away somewhere they  were going to completely fire the guy they're pretty strict over there yeah yeah because it goes all that  shit uh goes up so if if somebody doesn't uh if a head doesn't roll then somebody above him's head 
[02:53:00]  will roll because his head didn't roll that's how this shit works they put everybody in like that  was around the area in a catapult and they launched them all to the farthest ends of the precincts and  yep and well they picked one or two people and those people just they go to the guild they go to the  gallows yeah the sacrificial lambs uh that cop that shot that cop that followed the order that  guy's probably never going to see a day of patrol again either that guy's going to be tucked away  somewhere but how can they how can they take your pension like if you have like 20 years of good 
[02:53:30]  service how can they just like how is it legal to take a pension for that unless you do something  criminal but if you just make a bad call in a tense situation it's like there's been cops that  fired their weapons when it wasn't warranted but they said it was understandable as why they did it  well you have to also understand about all the different unions that are involved in our job  like each rank has their own union and as you get higher up the more kiss ass they are because 
[02:54:00]  they're trying to get closer and closer to like those top spots so their unions get weaker and weaker  and weaker i mean like oh so like when you get all the way up to lieutenant they you know they're not  going to fight for you they're just yeah coming company men well the other lieutenants are probably  happy to have you out because you're one one less guy they have to compete with yeah i mean it's  just a really sad situation man i mean and i mean the guy killed himself too i mean what kind of money  is his family gonna i know right that's terrible man they just you know for some reason cops aren't 
[02:54:30]  allowed to make mistakes like sometimes it's a genuine mistake it's not it's not meant with malice or  anything it's it's not racism it's not this that it's just holy shit i made a mistake like you go  to the deli and the guy puts fucking uh mustard when you ask for mayonnaise it doesn't affect  anyone's life that's a guy who should kill himself exactly i mean these are all situations that we're  invited into it's not like we created anything like you show up to some wild scene a naked guy on a  ledge just 50 60 people watching and screaming and and you just you know and then all of a sudden 
[02:55:00]  you got to just make a split decision and i don't know if something bad happens in the last 22 years  of your life but now i've just been around hey matt can i uh stay right where you are uh somebody's  amazed that we're defending the cop in this situation all right uh tom hey what's going on guys what's  your what's your take on this really i can't believe this guy is actually defending this cop he  tased a naked guy with a light bulb dude i never got a pba card from a naked guy with a light bulb 
[02:55:30]  we're not saying we're defending him we're saying he's gonna have to kill himself i just said it was  a bad call in the field or whatever you want to call it i said it was a bad it was a bad call i'm  absolutely defending the cop he did what he thought was right i still think unfortunately the guy died  and that sucks for for the guy and his family but the the cop didn't go out there like yeah let's kill  another one and matt's right he goes 99 of the time the guy would have rolled off it would ended up on a  youtube thing everyone would have been laughing because he'd roll off the awning and and land on his fat  stomach we've all seen the bear fall out of the tree and nothing happened to the bear right you 
[02:56:00]  know but every once in a while that bear's gonna fall out of the tree and crack its skull and die  fell on his head i don't think you should i think tasing him was a bad move uh i don't think  it was they they could you have a hostage negotiators or he's not because he's holding a  light bulb he's not threatening anybody's life he's just an annoying nuisance yeah yeah and it  wasn't a bad spot they could have they could have they could put stuff people jumping out of uh  building they could have put something in case he falls off it was a terrible it wasn't that high  up to tell you the truth he just fell really up on his head yeah uh but yeah you guys someone 
[02:56:30]  probably could have caught him if they just would have lined up that way but yeah they thought the  worst maybe he'd have a sprained ankle or something but he just fell if you look at all if you look at  the video also you see a cop there's a cop over running trying to get him off also what if that guy  slipped and fell and broke his skull open i mean their family ain't getting four million dollars from  anybody yeah we got another job we got another cop you might have said this and if you did i  apologize but they were going to take uh this guy's pension away that you did say that okay i want to 
[02:57:00]  make sure that's uh out there and i don't say he felt like he was in a in on a really tough spot so he  takes his own life holy shit man it's just a really messed up situation man i mean nobody there ever  but nobody there was like oh let's go kill this guy i mean nobody that was like there was no intent to  to do anything but just get this scene over with already i mean dude i you know we're lucky enough  that we have a lot of cop friends and i i think we understand uh the tough job you guys have out 
[02:57:30]  there i'm really i'm driving at brownsville right now for the day you know oh hey you have fun over  there there you go lock the doors all right we're gonna put on the blinders and just drive through my  friend let them sort it out themselves yep keep keep fighting the fight guys all right matt we're  going to take a break otto is in studio more with otto from otto and george in just a bit  yeah very violent yeah well here we are 
[02:58:00]  you're back to the open anthony radio program  change we need discussing apoco apocalypto  off the air with otto peter yeah a very predictable movie huh that that's great apocalypto  yeah and apparently obama's giving a little speech here huh then we noticed that grand  rapids we noticed that obama has changed his look he's very like serious he's got he's squinting his  eyes and he's very like yeah you gotta listen to me because this country needs me 
[02:58:30]  very very serious look at he hasn't looked like that the whole time no he's usually smiling has  a little joke for everybody but now this is like his people said you got to get out there and be  serious peeps show the serious side of obama squint your eyes a little bit did we ever find out what  nationality his mom is we know she's like uh she was white his his father was is african his father's  african his mother's white but white doesn't mean just white white but dutch that's like the old 
[02:59:00]  joke in um blazing saddles excuse me i heard you ask for a nigger i'm dutch oh yeah remember that  look at that circus ape over his left shoulder there though um by the way i made up dutch i don't  know what nationality his mother oh you silly i'm just a good actor dutch his father was an african  muslim uh well of course yeah we don't want no arabs oh we're no arab getting in the white house 
[02:59:30]  and name is obama hussein is this the edited or the unedited because if if there's beeps you know  the new the new listeners are going to lose their minds let me see the disc yep hey auto marac auto  what do your boys say about obama i think that's worth repeating on the show boy track one and then this  well okay who's that that you know that guy that comes with you that we refuse to give a microphone 
[03:00:00]  to oh kenny oh he said look kenny says he uh michael said he looks like a puerto rican vampire see  that's funny enough to be at the big table why does he have to sit at the kids you could invite him  over i i did he didn't want to come to get out i said why don't you come over he's like no he did yes  yeah he really did he said i made that up i'm an actor you're no you're a liar you are uh faucet's  plane was found wells oh the plane now yes wreckage confirmed to be missing adventurer's plane they 
[03:00:30]  found his license his pilot's license yep and uh that how about his fucking skeleton yeah well that that  they uh they uh found the license then they looked in the area for the plane found the plane oh okay and uh  uh no no word on the body yet did he ever get out of the plane though that's i guess what they'll  find out i'm sure in the middle of the area he was in um some uh some animals come a-nipping i would  think he's probably scattered about as little bones um yeah people make good eating for those things 
[03:01:00]  out there why would his license be found somewhere oh maybe it came how did the license get thrown from  the plane it was a cruise missile yeah let's can i see we got to play our southern obama fan  this is what anthony's counting on this is what i want to bring i want to bring it auto to the uh  the the party today you know obama's surging in the polls he's got a lead over mccain now because 
[03:01:30]  his poll is surging because of the the economy sucks and a lot of people are now saying well we need  a democrat because the economy sucks yeah but but anthony goes no no no my friends he's uh counting  on people like this woman you're about to hear and the rest of middle america to do the right thing  this is the last hope for um for our country to not have obama as president okay when we're at war  with the arab we do not need a damn arab president when you go over there to them arab countries they 
[03:02:00]  are cutting off the heads of the soldiers of our americans and his middle name is hussein and we want  to we want to vote for somebody with a name like barack hussein obama why don't we just vote for  that's for that beer we want to vote for somebody with a name like barack hussein obama well 
[03:02:30]  why are we electing an arab when we're at war with iraq and iran yeah there you go so see um that to  me is uh hope i hear hope in that voice really yes and then you got the the clip that where'd you get  that cliff holy is at my house it's my mom dumb hay seeds oh my god barack hussein obama now we're 
[03:03:00]  gonna have that for president that's what they're saying hopefully not you better watch he's on the  negros side too oh my god remember me yeah he likes him no black ain't got nothing to do with the  way the arab they're trying to sneak this guy into our country this is butterette hussein obama they are 
[03:03:30]  trying to win the war and they are not going to do it america is going to win oh these colors don't  run henry clinton for president all the way oh my god these colors don't run  america love it or leave it like it or lump it yeah colin made a great point  great point yesterday what's wrong with her that joke where they where she likes the 
[03:04:00]  makers that was probably because she sat next to a black guy at lunch oh yeah that was probably a  running joke with those fucking hay seeds oh i'm sure for 20 or 30 years that she did something nice  to a black guy one that hasn't changed like people think there's you know change going on as far as  i know that's that could have been pulled from the 1800s oh my god damn let me tell you  jed yeah they want to elect barack hussein obama jed what are we gonna do well see if mr drysdale 
[03:04:30]  wants to give us a little money maybe jethro wants to do some president i'll do some president  jet jet see the boy wants to be president he wants to do some president  ellie may could be my vice president  well that'll be cute to go on tv with her critters 
[03:05:00]  that's what she sounded like we have a party at the cement pond  damn jethro critters i want to be an astronaut do some astronaut  oh nice i'll give him some of my rheumatism medicine  that joke she's always carrying around  how did some of those shows fucking get on tv i got a great idea a bunch of hillbillies strike 
[03:05:30]  oil get rich and i have to move to beverly hills wonderful  like in that dyke that worked at the bank of mr drysdale miss hathaway she sounds like uh  the voice in cool hand luke absolutely it's coming in a lot oh yeah what we have here  value to communicate  big hair fucking pie eating bitch at the bank strother martin  we um we got some audio uh it's been brought to our attention it's very exciting uh in the 
[03:06:00]  satellite radio world we start our show kind of talking about some stuff right uh i guess on  serious website we we got some fine fine front page coverage oh yeah and on xm's uh website  howard's getting some some fine front page coverage yeah but what also is up there is audio  trying to lure new uh new listeners oh so if you're on xm and yet maybe you haven't heard 
[03:06:30]  howard in a while they got a little sample of what howard's doing uh-huh then you go to sirius and  you haven't heard us at all or whatever they got a little sample of what opie and anthony are doing  and it's been brought to our attention by more than one person that uh that our audio sucks  compared to howard's oh no really so uh what do you mean bad quality sound quality we're gonna  find out now i hear bad sound quality bad bad material bad bad yeah bad clips oh yeah a lot of  other things they you know could have been used why not have good clips oh have us involved 
[03:07:00]  so yeah right jesus christ you pick it so instead of taking someone else's word for it we decided to  bring this to uh everyone's attention and we'll make a decision without without getting third-hand  information we did pick it i think right not us but didn't some of our crew pick it better not  of it well that's what we're going to find out okay so here we go  on 1906 the howard stern revolution began 
[03:07:30]  kind of radio you could hear all over the country  no censorship yes howard stern back to the news  howard stern howard 100 now on xm satellite radio  the fact that he's allowed to say what he wants and do what he wants is kind of awesome and the  show is going strong come on i can't believe he's doing this uncensored entertainment you can't get  anywhere else i think satellite is the future of radio experience the best of serious all right 
[03:08:00]  oh no wow so what do you think that all right i'll be honest it's a lot of a lot of action in  there yeah yeah a lot of sounds energy explosions yeah i didn't even hear your names yeah  no we learn in that one there's two separate ones that's the one for the xm was on xm and  now ours for all serious oh no that was too busy it was no information and it sounded very high  energy high energy is it's selling the product you know oh let's see uh what we get for us 
[03:08:30]  here's oopie guess what's easy to us doing radio here's anthony piece of cake you come in you yap  into a mic how hard could it be that's right it's the opie and anthony show from 6 a.m the new  eastern yes i heard they're very good when they get followed by ronnie and fezzy  nothing stops this guy apparently he's got the only on the virus yeah it's far right through  that guy sure was a chatty kathy doll i hope he's dead right now i hope something happened  and he died i hope he was talking and didn't hear the truck horn 
[03:09:00]  it was good a lot of you that was cool it's fucking so the jimmy show is on i don't mind  that one because that was for the jimmy show now play the opie and anthony one that was  the jimmy there's apparently um who who said that and don got uh promoted oh boy i bet he was  behind it that is not as good it's nor is dude it's suck that's stunk on ice what what here's 
[03:09:30]  this is the first impression serious is getting about here's anthony that was a fucking terrible  introduction and then she's selling a cool show it's here's opie here's anthony and then jimmy clips  it should be the opie and anthony it should be the opie and anthony show and then playing clips of the  show right no matter who's talking it doesn't have to be it weren't good clips i don't care  no they weren't it wasn't a good clip jimmy said some funny stuff those clips weren't it no this is  an easy one that stinks okay it's that was the direction we got from dc but from dc what they 
[03:10:00]  say are you humor no no remove all you are you passing the book who said in dc that was the copy i  got from don it was don wicklin why is that from don it's not it's not not writing copy but we tried  to make it light because you guys are always complaining about how serious what light how  that wasn't light that was horrendous how about you pretty much go with one of our show intros with  all the dumb the news people talking about us being shocking and all that crap oh we can do that 
[03:10:30]  and then a bunch of montage clips of like oh my god oh screaming and yelling and the pack  puking and puking or fucking this is our this is what they're hearing no i wouldn't subscribe to  that awful show i want to fucking leave it there we also didn't know what it was going to be used for  so well the other side did the other side knew exactly what it's going to happen they certainly  dish power stirs uncensored uncensored unbelievable power stirs oh my god holy 
[03:11:00]  shit you gotta listen to this god fucking show my god jesus ain't fucking christ  and now us and please do us uh do us the same favor all right let me uh hold on do us the same  favorite place oh jesus on the spot here a little bit but and ronnie and fezzy that's like don't  ronnie and fezzy oh here we go that sounds queer all right yeah that's no one no one at that series 
[03:11:30]  is gonna like well we thought these were like generic sweepers and here's us we had no idea  that these were these are being shown on their front fucking page well or heard and um we have to  know these things opie and anthony yeah they're on um they're on two that's what we do yeah  opie and anthony how about i wouldn't i wouldn't quite make it that would be light opie and anthony 
[03:12:00]  the sweeper doesn't oh here it comes how about fucking uh opie anthony that was the way the show  is introed that makes you want to listen to the show not like who are these mail-in-in faggots  right and the guy that talks too much there's no reason to to like even give it a try after hearing  that i have a whole obeying anthony oh jesus  i would like to make it known that on a number of occasions you guys have said that you don't like 
[03:12:30]  the serious intros okay serious meaning not the company we never said make them shitty  what no not shitty but we don't want serious wait what are you misinterpreting now  we didn't like what those dramatic whoosh bang intros you said it you said it a number of times  what that's what that's how we start every show i understand that but you said isn't it silly that  we do these these uh these um these whoosh bang serious intros for such a goofy radio show  that's our joke do you understand the difference between why do you have a hard on i don't know 
[03:13:00]  oh jimmy jimmy's uh got a little rod going  whenever steve defends himself yeah i don't understand a why you would get a hard on in  the middle of the radio show and b why you have to show us inappropriate chubby i like the line i  hope something happened and he died that was funny yeah but it was out of context yeah yeah see out of  context you don't really get what the fuck is being said i know it's hard in in that short period of  time yeah put together some kind of clip that makes sense but there's something else going on here  he doesn't understand why we're joking when when we have the huge huge open and then we're like oh god look 
[03:13:30]  okay boy the list is gonna be disappointed after hearing that open that's a joke see not only that  but goofing on ourselves you can't indiscriminately pick pick when it's a joke when it's not no here  it is here it is we don't want to we don't want to preach to the converted now what i mean by that is  if you did a pew pew pew promo uh just for our listeners they would be like you know what the  fuck are they doing but these are new people that aren't familiar with the show at all so you need to 
[03:14:00]  catch their attention by make maybe some stupid you know okay goddamn noises explosions and crap  and then and then once you got their attention then you need to give them a few clips that they're  like what the fuck is that wow in all fairness and yeah does derrick want to defend himself no  you know derrick was given the same instruction i was we didn't know but derrick is a raging  alcoholic derrick has uh has another angle on this he's saying that there was no copy from washington  oh there wasn't yeah there was so you guys winged it you're like uh bill murray and stripes you 
[03:14:30]  just you went along yes did your own little boot camp thing what is that don't bang into uh  uh don't bang into jimmy's heart on on the way in by the way yeah i think you sit down jimmy no  i have to walk my friend he was looking yeah that's probably why you got a heart on your dummy  him off into the table with my foot oh see what do you want hard hat or hard on right  that guy can't help it 
[03:15:00]  that douche yeah please fuck him  yes uh derrick uh i think the only direction really came from dc was that it was between 30 and 60  seconds and oh my god nazis i think and go time spent recording this promo was about 15 seconds  come in turn on the mic and left and i was like okay i guess i have to  fucking put something together and that was that you just spewed some lines and then derrick like  worked around because we thought we were airing on this channel to air you know like yeah i don't 
[03:15:30]  know we're blowing it again we always blow it first impression and no one is getting an impression  you don't get a second chance at a first impression um that's what i heard on the person has down  syndrome or alzheimer's yeah reagan you're 400 400 shots the first impression who are who are you  yes wow nancy how long pleasure to meet you how long is that been up i think it just went up today  all right dog shit there dude don't did it all go on to the website the first day let's
