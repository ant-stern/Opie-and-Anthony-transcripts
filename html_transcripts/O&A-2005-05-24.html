<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show returned from suspension, launching into a discussion about their own abrupt departure and the resulting speculation.  The main focus quickly shifted to the firing of WCBS-TV reporter Arthur Chen (later corrected to Chan) for using the F-word on air after being interrupted by two individuals holding an Opie and Anthony sign, one of whom was identified as "Crazy Cabbie" from the Howard Stern Show. The hosts debated the reporter's reaction, WCBS's zero-tolerance policy, and the ensuing media coverage, pointing out inconsistencies and inaccuracies in news reports.  They highlighted the significant online buzz, including numerous downloads of the video and articles in various publications, even reaching the Chinese press.  Much of the segment consisted of the hosts reacting to news reports and online commentary, especially criticism from radio personality Alan Sniffen.  Numerous listener calls offered opinions on the incident, and the hosts promoted their "What the f*** is your problem, man?" t-shirts (although they lamented that the word "fuck" was censored on the shirts).  They also complained about studio employee Ricky and food issues.  The hosts speculated whether Chan's outburst was a planned event orchestrated by their listeners.

The show continued with audio clips from other radio personalities, most notably Todd Schnitt (whose name became a running gag regarding its pronunciation), criticizing Opie and Anthony's past antics, including the infamous St. Patrick's Cathedral sex incident.  Schnitt's criticism was presented as playing into the hosts' hands.  Humorous tangents included discussions of past "assaults on the media" by listeners, involving obscene signs (including one with the C-word) displayed behind news reporters, and a woman with an Opie and Anthony sticker on a Today Show broadcast.  They also mentioned a video of Opie smashing a pinball machine belonging to former colleague Al Dukes.  Several calls from listeners punctuated the segment, with in-studio guests mentioned including Club Soda Kenny, Rich Voss, Francine (who wanted to do the news), and Drew Boogie (who played a remixed song based on Gray Wolfâ€™s Tippi Tom ramblings).  The segment also touched upon the death of Lopez from Kirk, Mark, and Lopez, and ended with a mention of Jimmy Norton's upcoming garage sale.  The entire segment was rife with profanity.

The next segment intertwined Opie's apartment move and furniture woes, a graphic description of a threesome involving Opie, Voss, and a 19-year-old woman (with emphasis on Voss's performance), and further reactions to Alan Sniffen's audio response.  Opie's moving struggles provided humorous commentary on the state of his old furniture.  A failed attempt to use a Darth Vader voice modulator on Kenny led to Kenny interviewing listeners outside in the costume.  The show featured remixes of listener-submitted "Psycho Ex-Girlfriend" calls, including one with Rich Voss's voice, leading to humorous reenactments.  Francine's news segment veered into movie reviews, generating further comedic situations due to technical difficulties.  Listener calls and interactions with people outside the studio waiting for a giveaway were also included, with Rich Voss present in the studio.  The segment concluded with a Spanish translation of the infamous "Bill's Dead" prank call.

A subsequent segment covered a variety of topics. The hosts discussed *Star Wars Episode III*'s box office success (with one host admitting to never having seen a Star Wars film), offered vulgar commentary on Mariah Carey and her album *The Emancipation of Mimi*, discussed a hospital rape news story (followed by an inappropriate tangent about Michael Jackson), and commented on a Newsweek article about U.S. soldiers allegedly flushing Korans down the toilet.  They also discussed the delayed delivery of their merchandise, offered a cynical and sexually suggestive take on Laura Bush's visit to Jerusalem, and reacted to a news story about free condom distribution.  A significant portion focused on a gross-out bit centered on the smell emanating from Rich Voss's ear.  Jamie and Adam Hyneman from *Mythbusters* were interviewed, discussing the show's conception, experiments, permit challenges, and anecdotes.  Francine delivered comedic news reports, and several callers participated.  Rich Voss was a studio guest, along with Jamie and Adam Hyneman.

The final segment featured Jamie and Adam from *Mythbusters* continuing the discussion.  They detailed various experiments, including a house blown up with bug bombs, a test of surviving a fall into water by hitting it with a hammer (the dummy was severely damaged), and an attempt to recreate an *Indiana Jones* stunt (the dummy disintegrated).  Adam recounted setting his hair and eyebrows on fire and having his lips sucked into a vacuum cleaner. Jamie described an unpleasant experience with a decaying pig carcass.  A caller who cleaned up dead bodies corroborated their descriptions of decomposition, adding a gruesome anecdote.  They discussed the *Mythbusters* production process, including the "B-team" and negative fan mail about new female crew members.  Finally, they discussed their past work in film, including Adam's role in the original *Star Wars* and Jamie's work on *RoboCop* and *Arachnophobia*. Adam also mentioned his role as a stock boy in a Charmin commercial.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it goes!  Here it goes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  God, that irritates me.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact!  I want that fact!  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  We will be at Anthony's show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:04:30]  The O and A virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Well, it ain't fucking time, sweetheart. 
[00:05:00]  All right.  I'm here, man.  Yeah, we've had enough time off.  Not really.  Let me fix a couple of things.  Not really.  Let me fix a couple of things.  Yes, it's true.  We're back from our suspension.  Oh, boy.  Dude, I think they got suspended.  They're not on the air Friday.  See, I told you.  I told you they would get suspended.  These guys never learn.  They just walked out on the show on Thursday. 
[00:05:30]  I'm sure the corporate guys in Washington told them, you're suspended.  They didn't just walk out.  They were yanked during commercial.  You could tell.  I knew it.  I was trying to tell all you people here on the message board.  You didn't believe me.  They didn't get suspended?  The speculation that was being thrown around Thursday.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Well, maybe it would help if we told our faithful listeners, you know, they're with us day in 
[00:06:00]  and day out that, you know, we have to take a couple of days off.  Instead of in the middle of a bit going, well, this will have to wait until next time, and  we just like, and we're off.  We're into like some kind of dumb XM commercial, and then they come back from commercial, and  we're playing some old bit from like 1988 or something.  Yeah, maybe we should have.  Maybe we should have came a heads up.  We did say something during the 6 o'clock hour, though, during our little recordings that  we do for the 6 o'clock hour.  Remember when we all sit here?  Because that was Thursday, right? 
[00:06:30]  I don't remember.  Wasn't it Wednesday?  Something like that?  Something like that.  Friday?  Friday.  Was it the Friday before?  Oh, people wanted to kill us.  I mean, we have to back up.  Thursday's show is just off the charts, and we're playing our first show ever.  Yeah.  Is Rich Voss coming in today?  I told you guys to make sure he comes in today.  He never called me back.  Rich Voss never called back.  I'm very busy.  Because we wanted to continue down that road.  So we were playing our first radio show we ever did, and then we just flat out ran out  of time because we were having so much fun with Dave Mordal and Voss and Bonnie and everybody 
[00:07:00]  that, you know, Eric had me on the clock.  There was like a countdown happening.  So all of a sudden, I said something like, well, this is going to have to wait until next  time, and then we got out of the show.  Yeah.  Yeah, we had to go.  We had to go.  And I was like, oh, darn.  Darn it.  And someone's going, hey, dude, no more vacation.  Hey, we gave you, let's see, almost a month and a half.  Vacation?  We almost did a month and a half before we had to take another day or two off.  A four-day weekend does not a vacation make. 
[00:07:30]  No, you watch what happens after we only work three days this week.  Yeah, don't you sweat it.  Yeah.  We're giving you...  Oh, my God, that's right.  We're giving you guys so much programming that we have to rest our little brains from  time to time.  That's right.  We're very stressed.  God, we are just the kings of taking time off.  We have it down to our signs.  And then, you know, I'm already working the gang in Washington, how we're really tired  and the creative process is getting to us. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And we're doing the equivalent of a five-hour talk show because we don't play commercials.  Right.  So I think it's a really good thing that, you know, Anthony and I take a few more days off  this summer.  And all of a sudden, Eric Logan's like, dude, I haven't had a vacation since, like, 2002.  Shut up.  That's Elo.  He's a boss.  That's Elo.  Yeah, he's got to, like, run the whole ship.  Get in there.  Mm-hmm.  Be the boss.  Don't worry about us.  Yeah, we took a little time.  It's the problem. 
[00:08:30]  We didn't tell our listeners.  Like, it's our obligation to get on and tell our listeners.  We probably should have, though, because they speculate all weekend.  But, well, we don't expect.  They did it again.  They did it again.  They're suspended.  And we all know how this turns out in the end.  We never know when things are going to pop up that really feeds the speculation.  And I had no clue that the reporter, that we had an assault on the media behind. 
[00:09:00]  When was that, Thursday?  That was Thursday.  It was Thursday.  That's what makes it so great, perfect timing.  We had no clue that he got fired for cursing on the air, using the F word.  We knew that story had some legs.  Yeah.  And, boy, did it have legs.  It went all over the world.  Yes, it did.  I was reading our names.  Is it a China press?  Yeah, I was just about to say that.  I was reading our names in chinky writing.  The China press.  Little chinky writing.  And the only words I could recognize were, 
[00:09:30]  Obey and Anthony.  Yeah.  That made the press in China?  Yeah.  Well.  I was attempting to read chinky, just to see what they had to say about us.  Would you stop?  Chinese.  Chinese, chinky, whatever.  Chinese.  Yeah, it made some kind of China press.  Yeah.  A little bit of trouble.  He got in a little bit of trouble there.  And I, you know, it's, again, Viacom, who owns CBS, buckles under and fires the guy. 
[00:10:00]  The guy should not have been fired for that.  It's, what, why can't people be human beings on television?  The guy was annoyed.  He spins around stupidly.  He was stupid.  He should have waited, you know, until the shot cleared.  Guy didn't even get the last sentence of the story out.  And he turns around and says, you know, what the fuck is your problem?  And it got on the air.  And Viacom, with their zero tolerance policy. 
[00:10:30]  What?  I am so sick of the zero tolerance policy with anything.  The zero tolerance policy winds up getting people in trouble that aren't really doing anything wrong.  You know, if somebody's doing something wrong, you give them the boot.  The second you put a zero tolerance policy on it, then you're suspending children for cutting a piece of bread to look like a gun and going bang, bang in the cafeteria.  Those are the people that get affected by zero tolerance policy. 
[00:11:00]  An honest mistake of a guy saying fuck on television where, you know, he should be reprimanded and perhaps taught how he should be on camera like that.  But firing him because of this zero tolerance policy, it's ridiculous.  And now the guy, you know, he's out of a job.  A lot of people are blaming us for it.  Which is sickening.  Which is ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  You get on that New York radio message board.  Did you read that?  Alan, yeah.  Come on.  Alan's a little off on this one.  Yeah.  There are times I agree with the dentist, with the radio dentist, Alan Sniffen. 
[00:11:30]  Times I don't.  And this is one time I don't.  He's lambasting the show and our fans and I guess Nathaniel, who did this whole thing, and saying that we shouldn't be doing this.  This is horrible.  We cost the man his job.  This is stuff.  This type of thing.  They make, well, you watch that America's Funniest Home Video shows and things like that.  They make whole segments based on people behind reporters when they're doing a live shot. 
[00:12:00]  When they're out there doing their live shot, they put themselves on the street and they're dealing with the public.  And these things happen.  It happens to them all the time.  And it will continue to happen.  It will continue to happen.  It will continue to happen.  Absolutely.  And because some guy stands there, Nathaniel is there with a sign, and some nut comes up on side of him and actually puts a gesture in the camera, which, by the way, the reporter never saw. 
[00:12:30]  He just saw some kind of discrepancy behind him, some kind of disturbance behind him.  Do you know who that was?  You haven't heard yet?  Oh, no, I haven't.  Oh, okay.  Yes, I have.  It was Crazy Cabbie from Howard Stern Show.  Everyone's favorite felon.  Everyone's favorite taxi vader.  Who, by the way, every time he sees Anthony and I on the streets of New York, kisses our ass and talks to us forever.  Unbelievable.  Comes up, hey, dudes, how you doing, man?  Show's going great.  And then he gets up there, and apparently he said, when Nathaniel said, ONA, XM Satellite Radio, he said, sucks. 
[00:13:00]  But it sounded like rocks.  I defy anybody watching that clip to see that he is not a fan of the show, that he was trying to actually show that ONA suck.  Right.  Because he comes off like just a super fan behind the camera, in front of the camera, behind the reporter.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable. It was stupid, crazy cabbie.  Yeah, I think he's apparently trying to give the sign the finger, but it doesn't really work. 
[00:13:30]  No, he wasn't. He was just, he wasn't.  I saw, I heard that from you, that was his explanation, and I watched the clip.  He, no, he wasn't.  He was just trying to be a part of the shot before he goes off to jail and gets railed in the ass for not paying his taxes.  Paying his taxes, stupid.  It's not trying to be funny on film.  You're funny in the accountant's office when you're writing a check to the federal government.  Idiot.  Now, if he really hates the show and wanted to give the finger to the sign, as he said, he should have grabbed the sign out of your hand. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  And smashed it over his knee and go, F these guys or something.  Or just taking the sign and smash it over Nathaniel's head.  Right.  Nice little wrestling move.  Which, by the way, would have been hysterical.  Oh, my God, I would have laughed my ass off.  Would have been hysterical.  Nathaniel's head goes through the sign.  That's what a real man would have done.  If he was supposedly against the show, please.  Instead, he politely let me put it in front of his face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's it.  Put it in front of his face.  By the way, Anthony, I just want to bow to Nathaniel today. 
[00:14:30]  Wow.  How do you bow?  You're bowing.  Jeez.  Dude, he gave us, like, massive...  Oh, like that?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Thank you very much.  All right, there you go.  Huh?  Good bow.  This guy gave us, like, massive, massive publicity.  A lot of press.  This little intern that I finally know his name.  It's Nathaniel, everybody.  Danny's assault on media looking a little thin compared to Nathaniel's.  You better paint ONA on an axe and bury it in someone's head on the phone, stupid. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, to the faithful listeners, they know what happened.  Like, earlier in the week, last week, Danny came up with a great assault on the media.  He had a cigarette in one hand, a coffee in another, and still was able to hold the sign  right in the back of the reporter's head.  And that reporter didn't lose his composure.  No.  And then, you know, you fast forward just a mere three days.  We were talking about Danny all week.  Oh, it was great.  And Nathaniel did what he did.  And thank God Nathaniel did a perfect assault on the media, by the way. 
[00:15:30]  And that's the only reason we're not in trouble in Washington.  No, because we didn't touch the guy.  We did nothing wrong.  We just stood there with a sign, and he said, you know, we rock, or whatever he said.  And this is why the Alan Sniffen radio message board there, why he's got it totally wrong.  Of course.  If one of our guys had walked up to the reporter, touched him in any way, started cursing behind  him, did something that interfered with his actual report, then there would have been  a problem.  And then you could actually see Alan's point. 
[00:16:00]  His point was that people should not do this kind of thing.  We got him fired.  If we weren't there, it never would have happened.  He never would have said that and would have still had his job.  Now, I really didn't even understand what kind of point he was trying to make, because  this happens to reporters all the time.  People get behind the shot.  Sometimes it's just nothing.  It's a crowd of people waving, and the reporter doesn't even know it.  And sometimes it's people, you know, coming up and yelling things to try to get a point 
[00:16:30]  across, political things, saying hi to their friends, anything.  Nathaniel, yes.  People kept making the point, oh, what if somebody came into your workplace and started yelling?  They do.  When we're out.  Yeah, but that's the thing.  He's in a public spot.  It's not like I burst into CBS studios and was like, you know, start taking over their  newscast.  Ah, which is next week.  That's right.  Doing that.  We're going to take this to a whole new level.  When we're out on the streets and things like that, yeah, there are people that screw 
[00:17:00]  with us.  When we do our live shows and we put ourselves in the position where we're in the public,  we don't know what the hell's going to happen.  And there have been segments that are just completely ruined by the animals that come to see  us when we're doing live shows.  So, yeah, it does happen.  And it has happened.  And when you guys got booted, I'm sorry to say, I didn't want to see this guy get fired  either.  He just seemed like a real douche to turn around like that.  But you know what?  Too bad.  When you guys got booted, there was not one person in the media stepping up to go, I mean,  even though what you did was definitely much more serious.  But the way they got the facts wrong and Paul was a producer, all these things they got 
[00:17:30]  wrong, they didn't even bother to give a shit and get the facts right.  So I have very little mercy for anybody in that position.  I felt the same way on a personal level, like because this guy is a human being and  he lost his job.  I feel bad about that.  But when you take it on the whole as here's one of the media, one of the guys that were  just, you know, crucifying us when we got the boot and like Jimmy said, getting everything  wrong, it's almost a little bit of justice.  But yeah, on a personal level, I don't want to see the guy get fired. 
[00:18:00]  No, not at all.  I mean, the guy just lost his composure.  You can't lose your composure in the number one market like that.  You can't.  There wasn't even a, he didn't even wait a few seconds.  And there was absolutely nothing for that guy to lose his composure over.  Right.  Nothing.  I think what happened was he was looking at the monitor because I've seen these live  shots and the reporters usually look at the monitor to take a look at the shots, see  if they look good, whatever.  And I'm sure while he was doing the report, he was looking at the monitor going, oh my  God, look what's happening behind me. 
[00:18:30]  And he was just losing his mind.  Do your MetroCard story and go to the tape and shut up.  Exactly.  This wasn't exactly 9-11 coverage.  It was some homeless guy.  That's a big story.  The homeless people use the MetroCard to let people through?  Yeah.  Wow.  Stop the presses.  Be careful on your way to work, folks.  The homeless guy may be scamming.  Who doesn't know that shit?  Oh, by the way, newsflash, guys, just be careful.  Homeless people also smell.  I don't know if you guys heard that.  And they shit outdoors.  I hope I'm not, like, scooping 60 minutes this Sunday.  Here's the audio. 
[00:19:00]  I mean, the video has been downloaded, I don't know, I don't know what it's up to, like 150,000  times or something like that from all over the world.  All over the world.  The clip went everywhere.  And then the press clippings are from almost every city in America.  And then it went to China and Current Affair did something on it and CNN Headline News.  Our good friend Imus talked about it.  Stupid Booker on KROQ talked about it.  Yeah, it was downloaded 120,000 times.  120,000 times?  And Danny's got a cute 9,000 last week. 
[00:19:30]  I thought that was nice.  Who else?  The other intern.  Yeah, exactly.  And I'm sure only...  They're counting their assaults on the media.  And I'm sure only 90% of those were people actually looking for my assault on the media.  What's this wet stuff on my bagel?  I don't know.  Did you spit on this?  Why would I be spitting on...  Oh.  Maybe Ricky was...  Maybe Ricky had an itch under his arm and then touched your bagel.  Ricky, what is this?  What is this?  The boss wants to know what the wet stuff is, Ricky.  What is this?  It might have been the eggs. 
[00:20:00]  There was...  Oh, God.  No!  It might have been eggs.  Yeah, the eggs had at least two years.  I want a toasted bagel, not an egg juice on it.  Let me get you another one.  Fuck!  Do I want you to get me another one?  No, actually.  Where's Travis?  Travis, could you please get me one?  God, there's always a problem.  Away with you!  Away!  Away!  Leave!  Leave the fucking studio!  I'm sick of you.  I'm sick of you.  You're incompetent.  You're completely incompetent. 
[00:20:30]  I can't stand you.  Hi, Kenny.  Here comes Kenny to save the day.  Travis, thank you, sir.  Here comes club soda candy.  He's big and stupid.  Six foot five killer.  I had it.  All right, relax.  Kenny's here.  Thank you, Kenny.  Want me to get it?  Here comes club soda candy.  Thank you.  Hey, Travis, give me some eggs, too, in that.  Hmm.  I'm kidding.  He would probably keep it separate enough where nothing would happen.  Of course he would.  I can't take it.  It's every fucking day.  It's every day.  It's now official.  Anthony has lost his mind. 
[00:21:00]  I can't take it.  That's it.  I lost it a while ago with him.  Jimmy lost it.  And now, finally, it's official.  My whole thing?  I could go months.  I love how he goes, well, it might be.  You don't hand Anthony any type of food primes and go, well, that could be.  That could be.  Oh, I'll eat it anyway.  Right.  Could be spit.  It could be anything.  What he should have said was, I have no idea.  That must have been something that they did when they were there.  I didn't do nothing.  It's wrapped.  Oh.  Patty's that kid in a line.  It could be.  I started cringing as soon as he said that. 
[00:21:30]  It could be.  It could be this.  He is never, ever to get food again.  Already, Jimmy, already.  You said that, right?  Like, you don't want him getting anything.  Yeah.  Actually, October 8th.  No more food.  You were just being a nice guy, Anthony.  He's completely failed the test on the food for months and months and months.  And took us out of the game again.  Holy shit.  We're in the middle of talking about this assault on the media, and now we have to talk about  Ricky again.  It could be.  It could be.  It's his little plan scene.  If Andy was getting a lot of air time here.  I had a good line about Danny, you know, not getting so many downloads. 
[00:22:00]  Exactly.  That was very funny.  Everybody was ready to laugh.  Yeah.  What was the line?  Well, I was saying, you know, he had so few downloads, and probably only 90% of those  were people actually looking for my video.  See?  It still works.  I love it.  And it's true.  Even though he did get some downloads, probably just mistakes.  But don't give, I don't like the way you keep using the name.  I don't reckon, just the other person.  The other guy?  Yeah.  It's just a perfect example of how marketing works, though.  I mean, we do these assaults on the media all the time, and we encourage you guys to 
[00:22:30]  continue doing the assaults on the media, by the way, because that was a whole discussion.  Will this end the assaults on the media?  Will they be told to stop doing that?  Of course not.  Especially if you do it like Nathaniel does it.  Classy.  Classy and perfectly.  Right.  But it's a good way to show you how marketing works.  You know, Danny did pretty much the exact assault on the media, but his reporter didn't lose  his mind.  Got to get the reporters to lose their mind.  The reporter loses his mind, and now it's a story all over the country with everybody 
[00:23:00]  checking out the show, checking out the video, writing about us on message boards all over  the place.  And they will continue, because it is a very good way to promote the program.  It's legal.  It's harmless.  And it's completely legal and harmless.  Do your job right.  Like, sorry.  You know what, let's be honest.  That was ego.  The reporter's ego, like you pointed out with Newsweek, they like to have the reel of all  their stories.  His ego was affected because he was being a little bit irritated by some pest.  Pest.  And you know what, that's a real statement about that guy. 
[00:23:30]  You don't just turn around and go, what the fuck is your problem, man, like over something  like that.  You don't do it, unless that's who you are.  Right.  Well, the video's still up on opianthony.com, but here's the audio just to get everyone up  to speed again.  Good morning, Sean.  This is apparently a very simple crime to commit.  All one has to do is buy a couple of multiple MetroCards, stand at the turnstile, and just  continuously swipe people in all day.  Police sources say these guys net a couple hundred dollars a day, and that's pure profit,  but it's costing the TA a great deal, about $16 million a year, and they're trying to put 
[00:24:00]  a stop to it.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  They're trying to put a stop to it.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Sorry about that distraction, Beaufort.  The Transit Committee is expected to pass this later on today.  Ask Asa.  Hey, Asa, where's the unemployment line?  Come on, you. 
[00:24:30]  Wow, he didn't even, like, stop.  No, there wasn't.  See, I mean, I feel bad the guy lost his job, but he didn't even, like, think.  He blew his cool.  Well, John in New York on the phone making a very valid point also.  All right, let's go to John in New York.  Hey, yeah.  How you guys doing?  Hi, John.  I just want to state the obvious that reporters are never intrusive into other people's lives.  There you go.  There's another thing.  A couple of guys behind the reporter, maybe getting on his nerves a little bit. 
[00:25:00]  He loses his cool and starts cursing.  These reporters are constantly screwing with people, constantly getting in their face, and on their jobs.  You're right.  How many times do you see them go to their jobs, shove that camera in, and try?  On purpose, they try to get a response like this from these people.  You're right.  They would love for the person to lose their cool and say, fuck, so they can bleep it out and show what an asshole, nasty guy this guy is.  Maybe somebody's got to go jump out his window, climb down some bedsheets in order to get away from the cameras, huh? 
[00:25:30]  There you go.  All right, guys.  Punching out.  Thanks, John.  All right, so that's a great point.  We made the newspapers all over America.  I haven't even read these yet, the Daily News and the Post, Anthony.  We're a little behind the times, and then we've got some audio to get to.  The story just gets more and more interesting.  Basically, I'm trying to figure out, I think this was from the Post, New York Post from Friday.  News Channel 2 can't afford a Ford. 
[00:26:00]  What are they getting at?  The A-F-Ford.  Ford.  A-F-Ford.  Oh, it's News Channel 2 can't A-F-Ford.  A fucking Ford?  Yeah, the F word.  They're trying to get really clever with the headline, and I don't really get it.  It's A-F-F-F-O-R-D.  F-O-R-D.  Or F word, so they're like F word, but then said F Ford. 
[00:26:30]  F Ford.  Oof.  That's a stretch.  Anyway, Channel 2 reporter Arthur Chen was fired yesterday after he used F word on air during a 6 a.m. broadcast.  Chen was standing in front of a subway station delivering a live intro to a segment about a MetroCard scam  when two men walked up behind him, held up a sign, and began chanting, Opie and Anthony.  Once again, wrong, by the way.  Wrong.  Of course.  Wrong.  It was Nathaniel, and then it was Cabby there.  The video was available to anybody who actually wanted to see the event. 
[00:27:00]  You would think a news person might want to see the event.  Yeah.  Wrong again.  Wrong again.  Held up a sign, began chanting, Opie and Anthony.  The names of the XM Satellite Radio, shock jocks, shock jocks, shocking, shocking, shock jocks.  We are so shocking.  Shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock.  Ugh.  Chen thinking he'd finished the live part of the report.  Another.  Uh-huh.  That's wrong, too.  He knew he was still live. 
[00:27:30]  He just lost his mind.  Yep.  You could hear it in the clip.  He didn't even pause after he was done.  Barely got that last word of his report out.  Uh, Chen thinking he'd finished the live part of the report, whirled around and blurted  out to the interlopers, what the fuck is your problem, man?  By the way, by the way, later on the show today, pick up your, what the fuck is your problem,  man, t-shirt.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Do we know how to exploit or do we know how to exploit?  People are lining up outside the station right now.  That's right.  To pick up their, what the fuck is your problem, man, t-shirt.  You know what's it?  Man.  Yes, go ahead, Chen.  You know what's very interesting is the one time some idiot reporter loses his cool is when  his story, you never hear a guy reporting a rape or a child murder going, what the fuck  is wrong with people?  They can handle it then, but God forbid somebody's interfering with his dog shit story and he  loses his mind. 
[00:28:30]  And God forbid he had some honesty as a human being and go, I'm doing a live report, could  you idiots stop this?  Right.  Could they for once address it like human beings?  Hey, you jackass.  Yeah.  It's just a bunch of phonies out there.  Absolutely.  Like we say almost every day in the show now.  One of Howard Stern's cronies was involved in this and that, that big fucking old lady  pussy shut up and didn't say a word about it.  No.  Didn't say a word about it.  Friday didn't say a word about it on Monday.  One of his guys was involved in a pretty huge radio story and he just kept his mouth 
[00:29:00]  shut.  Because it wasn't me.  Well, Alan Sniffen didn't like it.  Alan.  It's Alan Sniffen.  Very disappointed in his take on the whole thing.  Yeah, it's like stop being a baby, dude.  Stop it.  Ah, it's all something meatier.  Not good.  Shut up.  They're fucking great.  Anyway, continuing here.  It's cool.  And they will continue.  Oh, by the way, Pat, people with your live shots out there, this will not stop.  You can bet that's not going to happen.  You know how much they're freaking out right now? 
[00:29:30]  We're going to send them right back on top of their trucks again.  Dude, because they, you know, oh, wait a minute.  Who's this?  Pat?  Hey.  What's up?  Nothing much.  Oh, Pat from Monarchy.  What's up, Pat?  No, Pat from Monarchy is out here right now.  Oh, okay.  We're threatening to hold Travis hostage if the animals are not let upstairs.  There will be no blackmail.  Travis has to get up with my bagel.  Go fuck yourself.  We have nine animals and one golfer, and we want to be upstairs. 
[00:30:00]  They're holding Pat hostage until we let the animals upstairs to check out the show.  They're slowly but surely coming to the station to pick up their what the fuck is your problem,  man t-shirts, which I think will happen at around 9 o'clock today.  Anyway, now that this video has made it all over the country, Anthony, and been reported  on CNN headline news and stuff, it's only going to make these animals want to do this more.  Now you're going to see a lot more assaults on the media.  You watch. 
[00:30:30]  Of course you will.  Everyone's going to want to.  They love to please us, Sophie.  Unfortunately for Chen, the camera was still rolling, and the expletive rang out loud and  clear over the airwaves.  I can confirm that he has been terminated.  A Channel 2 spokeswoman told Page Six, we have no further comment regarding his termination.  The network-owned station also issued this statement.  Oh, boy.  Here's the statement.  Uh-oh.  WCBS-TV apologizes for the use of inappropriate language today during our 6 a.m. broadcast.  We deeply regret the incident. 
[00:31:00]  Sincere, at least.  Yeah.  They're bags.  Um, did you read the AP story?  Uh, no.  This one was the best.  I read the last line.  It's just classic.  Uh, it tells the story.  Same story.  Subway station.  Blah, blah, blah.  Right, right.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Um, the F word went out of the air.  Channel 2 fired, uh, Chien yesterday.  As for the shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  As for the shock jocks, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:31:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  I didn't get a shock out of you.  Thank you, Travis.  You're welcome.  As for the shock jocks, Opie and Anthony, they're celebrating over the reporter's fire  firing.  How did this, yeah.  How, whoever did the AP report here, whoever wrote this, and this went all over the place.  First of all, we left the show Thursday before the guy was fired.  Right.  Before we knew anything about this firing, we left. 
[00:32:00]  We went our own ways.  Anthony went to.  We have not been on the air since now.  Right.  Anthony went to Colorado.  I went to Florida.  We'll get into that stuff a little later.  We weren't celebrating.  So how did this lying sack of shit that wrote this story, how did he assume we were celebrating  over the guy's firing?  How were they just allowed to print that?  How were they allowed to print that?  This is the AP story.  What the fuck is his problem, man?  Man.  Man.  Man. 
[00:32:30]  Man.  What the?  They're celebrating.  You know what we're celebrating?  We're celebrating the fact that we got some press.  I like that.  But as far as celebrating the guy's firing?  No one got a statement from any of us.  No.  So how does this guy go and say that we're celebrating over the reporter's firing?  They're making it really easy for me to not give a shit that the guy got fired.  These reporters.  Because they're all from the same mold.  Every single one of these jerk-offs are from the same mold. 
[00:33:00]  They're phonies.  Liars.  This guy is just.  He's an AP.  The guy.  This story's picked up by the AP, Associated Press.  And it's bullshit.  I read this in Colorado.  I read it.  Oh, really?  I'm celebrating the fact that the guy was fired.  Can we find out who wrote it?  It's not a secret.  There's got to be a way for someone on this show to find out.  Seriously, who wrote this?  I think they hide behind that little AP thing. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  I would love to find out.  Dude, they do this all the time.  I mean, this is just a dumb shock jock story.  But they do this with really serious news.  Yep.  Where they just make up their shit.  They made up that line.  Yep.  And whatever.  Is it going to affect our lives?  No.  It's probably going to make us even bigger.  Whatever.  But then you've got to wonder, what other AP stories out there are?  Are they just making up facts to make the story that much more interesting?  They make it up.  Like, where did he get that we're celebrating over the reporter's fire?  No one talked to me. 
[00:34:00]  I went into hiding for four days.  My nephew was graduating from high school.  Decided to go down there and support him.  And no one really got a hold of me.  No.  I didn't talk to anybody.  They didn't see me celebrating.  Although they were trying to get a camera crew down to Florida.  Current affair was.  A current affair.  They wanted to interview me at my nephew's graduation from high school.  They had a poll, I hear.  Yeah, we got all that.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, we've just begun with this story.  It's just taken on a life of its own. 
[00:34:30]  All right, getting to the Daily News story.  Let's see what's wrong in this one.  F-word cost TV guy a job.  TV reporter Arthur Chen was canned by CBS2 yesterday after he shouted the F-word at two meddlers.  Two meddlers.  Two meddlers.  Oh, you meddling kids!  Stop meddling!  Isn't that like an old Scooby-Doo line?  You meddling kids.  What was the line from Scooby-Doo?  And I would have gotten away with it, too.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  If it wasn't for you meddling kids.  That's right, okay.  At two meddlers who horned in on his live shot. 
[00:35:00]  Chen was in the middle of a 6 a.m. broadcast about MetroCard scammers when two men sneaked up behind him with a sign-promoting radio shock jocks Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Shock jocks.  Shock jocks.  Shock jocks.  For a few moments as the knuckleheads.  Knucklehead.  Hey, Nathaniel, you're a knucklehead.  You knucklehead.  I don't appreciate that.  Knucklehead one, and Danny, unfortunately, is now a knucklehead two.  You mean intern B?  Meddlers and knuckleheads, all of them. 
[00:35:30]  See?  Look at one reporter editorializing for the other reporter.  Isn't that kind of nice how protective they get for each other?  Let's get to it here.  For a few moments, as the knuckleheads heckled him and gave the finger to the camera, Chen kept his cool and continued talking.  But as soon as he finished his report, he spun around and shouted at the intruders,  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Once again, don't forget to pick up your What the fuck is your problem, man?  T-shirts later this morning outside. 
[00:36:00]  That's right, people.  Call the O.P. and Anthony Broadcast Center.  People lining up as we speak.  That's why Club Soda Kenny is here, by the way.  They're going to be collector's items.  If he thought the CBS control room had already cut the tape, he was wrong.  Now, he knew they didn't cut the tape.  He didn't even wait.  The expletive went out over the air.  Sorry about that distraction before, Chen said, when he returned.  Bofor.  What did he say?  Bofor. 
[00:36:30]  Bofor.  Bofor.  The apology apparently wasn't enough for CBS, especially when the FCC is cracking down on obscenity.  He's been terminated, station spokeswoman Audrey Pass said.  Chen, a former New York One reporter who joined CBS in 2003, told the Daily News he's sorry.  Power bitch.  I regret the entire thing, and I apologize to those who were offended, he said.  Meanwhile.  Meanwhile.  Meanwhile.  Fans of the O.P. and Anthony show who have mounted a campaign to annoy television reporters  were boasting about the infantile stunt on the DJ's website. 
[00:37:00]  The campaign isn't to annoy reporters.  It's to get the name O.P. and Anthony XM Satellite Radio on television without having to pay for it.  Because they don't really give us money for that here.  So that's the best thing.  Do you see how incestuous they are in their writing, man?  Do you see how incestuous it is?  The meddlers, which they are.  And, you know, knuckleheads, which they are.  And, you know, infantile stunt, which it was.  But then they say, Chen kept his cool and continued talking. 
[00:37:30]  It's almost like...  But they say that, like, you know, while it was happening, he was keeping his cool.  Oh, yeah.  But they cannot help but go to bat with a guy who fucked up.  Sorry.  He fucked up.  Yeah.  Nathaniel did nothing wrong.  He stood there with a sign like a million other people have done.  And old potty mouth couldn't take it.  And if you don't stop it, I may file a complaint against CBS because I was offended when this show played that 85 times. 
[00:38:00]  The potty mouth pair have a show on XM Satellite Radio.  They have to end this article with this.  Where they landed after being bounced by N.A.W. for a contest that enticed two listeners to have sex in St. Pat's Cathedral.  Ah, yeah.  So that's the New York coverage, but it went everywhere.  The AP story and what have you.  You're not the potty mouth pair.  Yeah, what kind of profanity did you use on national television?  Potty mouth.  Yeah, you didn't curse.  Tom on Long Island.  What's up, Tom?  Yeah, I just want to say real quick, I think the biggest story is definitely how these T-shirts are getting punched out out on the street right away. 
[00:38:30]  And the other XM radios, what are your brothers doing?  Nothing.  Taking months.  I still haven't done that.  What's up with that, O?  My brother took on a huge project.  I've got to tell you, there's these Spread the Virus T-shirts that, you know, there's like a limited run on these things, by the way, that my brother decided to make.  The logos are awesome and all that.  And he didn't expect as many people to actually want the shirts, so, you know, he's trying to figure it all out. 
[00:39:00]  They're being printed.  They're being mailed.  But the What the Fuck's Your Problem, man?  Shirts are all ready to go.  That's just, that was a quick hundred that we ordered.  I think my brother's up over a thousand of these Spread the Virus T-shirts, so he's in hell.  And pretty much the pre-ordering is over, but if you could get to my brother while they're still printing, maybe you could get on to the end of the order, okay?  So email him if you want your O.P. and Anthony Spread the Virus T-shirts at drduck at AOL.com. 
[00:39:30]  That's doctor, you spell that out, D-U-K at AOL.com.  Also a link on opianthony.com for your Spread the Virus T-shirts.  Speaking of T-shirts, Anthony, there's a couple other people that have ideas for T-shirts.  Chaz in New York, what's up?  Hey, man.  When I'm interns, pick me up, what the fuck's on my bagel T-shirt?  What the fuck's on my bagel T-shirt?  Yeah.  It could be a limited edition.  I want a shirt that just says, it might be, dot, dot, dot.  It might be.  Yeah, with a question mark. 
[00:40:00]  Pinchy, what's up?  Hey, boys, welcome back.  Thank you, Pinch.  Hey, I heard if you buy a What the Fuck's Your Problem, man? T-shirt, they'll throw in a,  Hey, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes up on T-shirt for free.  Oh, wow.  That's going back.  Pinchy out.  Very nice.  And I got to tell you, man.  Man.  Man.  That's going to be the word of the day.  Man.  Eric Logan and the gang down in Washington were just really cool about this.  Yeah.  Because Anthony and I know how this thing works sometimes.  We get a little nervous when these things happen.  When I heard, I got a little nervous.  Anthony called me from Colorado like, all right, dude, what's the deal? 
[00:40:30]  What is it?  What's the deal?  I go, you know what?  It's weird.  They're really, really excited down in Washington.  They think it was perfect.  They think the execution was perfect.  It was.  Absolutely.  And they supported us.  They said, you guys will have no problems with this.  Don't even worry about it.  Enjoy your couple days off.  Enjoy your long weekend.  I'm like, all right, great.  Thanks.  You see what the Boston Herald wrote?  No.  The Herald had a piece on Friday because the guy was an ex-Boston news guy.  Okay.  It said, Opie and Anthony claim another victim. 
[00:41:00]  The Manatees wrote about it in their column.  The inside track.  Yeah.  Claim another victim?  What victims have we claimed in the past?  Ourselves?  A couple of times?  Psycho Mark?  There's been a few here and there.  Got fired?  Yeah.  We'd leave some wreckage.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Start Stevens?  Well, start Jeremy.  Jeremy?  Rick?  Yeah.  Well, okay. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  Accurate recording, then, from the Herald.  Another one in our wake.  Here is what Alan Sniffen had to say, Anthony, on this New York Radio message board.  It's Alan Sniffen.  Alan Sniffen, yes.  I have defended ONA on this forum frequently, but some of their fans are idiots, and ONA  are idiots for encouraging them.  Below linked is a story from the Daily News which basically tells how two of ONA's lame-brained  fans...  Why, you lame-brains? 
[00:42:00]  Lame-brained fans disrupted a TV correspondent...  Wait, we've got to keep a list of these words.  I got it.  Lame-brained, knucklehead...  Medallers...  Medallers...  Medallers...  Intruders...  Intruders...  And interlopers...  Interlopers...  Interlopers...  Cronies...  They say cronies?  They were cronies, yeah.  ONA's cronies.  Nice.  Yeah.  They're a bunch of Voss words.  Yeah.  These old 40s words.  Voss wouldn't know what cronies meant.  Crony.  Uh, let's see.  ONA's lame-brained fans disrupted a TV correspondent's live report which ultimately resulted in the 
[00:42:30]  reporter using an obscenity.  Should the reporter have known better?  Yes.  But, the guy lost his job because he was put in a position that I'm willing to bet most  any of us would have responded to in the same way.  BAP!  Wrong, Alan!  You're wrong, you're wrong, Alan's wrong, Alan's sniffing.  Wrong!  Most of us would have responded in the same way.  Maybe if you're walking down the street and someone's following you with a sign and won't 
[00:43:00]  go away, but if you're a reporter in New York City, you know better, and you know  this happens, and you've probably had it happen to you before.  You just deal with it.  You're out in public.  Things are going to happen.  What does he mean, most people?  How would he know?  Who's ever held a sign up to him that would annoy?  Did someone across the street hold up a sign?  Cheaper fillings here.  When he's trying to do his recorded portion of his message board presentation? 
[00:43:30]  Well, he'll talk about this the next time he does his recording.  Board Reflections.  Make sure we get a copy of Board Reflections when he talks about this.  I'm going to talk today about Opie and Anthony and these moron interloper cronies holding  up signs.  I can't wait to hear that.  It's a perfect name because that's how you feel when you hear it.  So now he's out of work because these two morons interfered with his broadcast. 
[00:44:00]  And these two morons were encouraged indirectly by ONA.  Now, let me correct you.  They were encouraged directly from ONA.  We encourage this directly.  We don't want them touching the reporter, hurting them or anything.  We want the sign with our name on it behind them in the shot.  That's it.  If they're out on the street, we're going to be looking for the live shot.  And it's going to keep happening.  This doesn't mean that every time it happens, someone's going to lose their job, does it? 
[00:44:30]  No.  You don't lose your cool like this.  We've done this dozens of times at this point.  And this is the first guy that lost his cool.  It's one thing to make fun of a situation and or people that take things too seriously,  which is, I guess, the news guys.  I get it with that.  And ONA are frequently good at it.  But a prank that results in the victim losing his job is just plain going too far.  This isn't a prank that results in the victim losing his job. 
[00:45:00]  It isn't.  Because you could do this a thousand times and no one's going to lose their job over it.  This is a promotion that we do that resulted in the guy losing his job because he made the mistake, not us.  We didn't error going out there with a sign and holding it up behind the shot.  This guy made a mistake.  That's it.  While ONA didn't specifically stand behind this guy and wave a sign,  they have consistently encouraged this kind of behavior from their idiotic fans 
[00:45:30]  who think this makes for gooder radio.  He puts in quotes.  It's more gooder.  It's more gooder, you ass.  More gooder radio.  And it does make for more gooder radio.  It's not funny.  This has given us a lot of fodder today.  Just ask Arthur Chien, who is now looking for a job because he responded to the two knuckle-dragging idiots.  Bless you.  Bless you, Ant.  Thank you. 
[00:46:00]  That's what was on your bagel before.  No, Clay.  Throw it away.  Just ask Arthur Chien, who is now looking for a job.  Knuckle-dragging idiots who gave their permission to act like jerks by a radio show.  Yeah, I know.  It's publicity.  Publicity at someone else's expense.  His livelihood.  Again, wrong!  We're not doing something that is going to result in someone's firing.  It absolutely isn't. 
[00:46:30]  We are not doing something that is going to...  If we go out today and do it again, does it mean this guy's going to get fired?  No.  The guy made a mistake.  That's it.  He made the mistake.  He lost his cool, cursed, and got himself thrown off the air.  Alan's totally wrong on this one.  Da-da-da-da-da.  All right.  Then we got some audio.  It made a lot of local news, but basically we got some of the more interesting ones here, I guess. 
[00:47:00]  Here's CNN headline news.  A reporter for WCBS-TV in New York has been fired for swearing during a broadcast.  Arthur Cheehan was doing a report on illegal subway car doctoring when he was heckled by two passersby.  He managed to stay composed during his live shot, but then the microphone caught him yelling in obscenity afterward.  The Cheehan has since apologized.  Guys, the hecklers were holding up a sign for the Opie and Anthony's satellite radio show.  Yeah, we're real stupid, Alan.  CNN headline news is saying our names, but we're dumb.  And I didn't heckle anybody. 
[00:47:30]  It's not like I was like, hey, Arthur, nice reporting, you know?  Yeah, that's heckling.  You know, if you would have been, hey, Arthur, come on, what the hell?  You stink.  This is an awful story.  You suck.  Be more funny.  Yeah, we're just a bunch of dummies.  We don't know how to get our names out there.  We're stupid.  Eric from Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, I'm just listening to this, and it's the same thing.  You hear it all the time.  If a little league umpire makes a bad call, the parent goes and beats up the umpire, is it the umpire's call that caused the beating? 
[00:48:00]  No, it's the parent losing their call.  Yep.  Ooh.  I like that.  I like that analogy.  So we should start beating the reporters?  I think so, yeah.  What is she saying?  Well, you get the point.  All right, thanks, Eric.  Okay.  I don't know what this means.  Jared in Jersey.  What's up, Jared?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  Hi, fella.  I just find it really amusing that all these reporters are bashing you guys for, you know, getting married with the sign in front of this guy's shot.  But at the same time, if you ever notice when they go live to, like, a protest or some event or something, say you're watching, like, Fox News, 
[00:48:30]  they will always get CNN signed, and they're like, CNN sucks.  They'll make sure it's in the shot while they're broadcasting live on Fox or something like that.  It's just ridiculous.  A lot of stories these guys do are in front of crowds that are yelling things, and they keep their cool.  Danny from Bowling Green, Kentucky, saying the reporter made two mistakes.  The first one was broadcasting right outside of the O&A studio.  Any subway stop in the city?  And he picks that one. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, he picks the one that is closest to us right here.  Not even a block away.  Ouch.  All right.  And then we have a current affair, Anthony.  A current affair is back, and the host of the show just stinks.  He is the worst.  Is he awful?  He is awful.  This show will go nowhere with this guy.  Now, it doesn't have the charm of the old current affair.  Not at all.  It is awful.  I took a peek, and it's just horrendous.  But they did a little piece.  Let's get a little business out of the way first.  That's the guy.  This is the guy that replaced Maury Povich. 
[00:49:30]  That's good.  Listen to his delivery.  Let's get a little business out of the way first.  This is a tape of a local New York CBS News reporter, Arthur Chien, doing a live-to-air stand-up in Manhattan.  Now, two geniuses come up behind him.  They're making noise and waving a sign, promoting two other rocket scientists, and making his job tough.  So what does he do?  And they're trying to put a stop to it.  What the f*** is your problem, man?  Exactly what a lot of New Yorkers might do under that kind of stress.  Hopefully, I wouldn't.  But he finishes...  Not on camera, you fucking asshole! 
[00:50:00]  Oh, I just did it.  Language, you man.  I used the F word.  What?  We're not rocket scientists, are we?  Why do people keep confusing us with rocket scientists all the time?  I know a little bit about rocketry.  I used to fly SD's model rockets as a kid.  But why do so many people get our jobs here on radio confused with some sort of rocket science all the time?  I think I know, because at times when you watch them on TV, you're overheard going, vroom, vroom. 
[00:50:30]  Maybe that's it.  They're a bunch of phonies, too, because they were...  This is rocket science.  Oh, wow, that's a new one.  It makes sense that your interns are geniuses, like he said.  Genius, right, because we're rocket scientists.  We would need geniuses around us to help us out with our rocket science.  Let's go to Frank in Virginia.  Frank?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I played Tommy or Rumble on the morning show when you guys had us calling in.  Okay.  And then yesterday they were talking about you guys. 
[00:51:00]  They're trying to get their fans now to do the assault on the media,  but they were talking about you guys going around America,  having people call in to basically make your show better by playing their show.  Ah, there you go.  These two guys are basically like Don and Mike,  except they don't kill puppies and have their awful wives call up.  There's a lot of Don and Mike hacks out there, trust me.  A lot of Don and Mike hacks.  Thanks, Frank.  Don and Mike are fine, guys. 
[00:51:30]  All right, let's...  I'm going to start off with this current affair thing.  Let's get a little business out of the way first.  This is a tape of a local New York CBS news reporter, Arthur Chien,  doing a live-to-air stand-up in Manhattan.  Now, two geniuses come up behind him.  They're making noise and waving a sign, promoting two other rocket scientists,  and making his job tough.  So what does he do?  And they're trying to put a stop to it.  What the f*** is your problem, man?  Exactly what a lot of New Yorkers might do under that kind of stress.  Hopefully I wouldn't.  But he finishes his stand-up, turns over and says, 
[00:52:00]  what the f*** is your problem, man?  Okay, so it's a big no-no to say the f*** word on TV.  We all know that.  But this guy didn't say it for effect.  He wasn't doing a Howard Stern or trying to shock anyone.  He was being badgered by two morons.  So what does CBS do?  They fire him.  The sack cut off his career basically over because they timidly and wrongly believe  the Federal Communication Commission will censor or fine them.  Well, here's some breaking news, fellas.  The FCC told us today they did not get one complaint. 
[00:52:30]  There you go.  Why didn't the parents' television council complain about that?  They complained about innuendo of bosomers around.  And here old potty mouth Cheehan.  There it is.  The big one.  The f*** word.  The number two bad word to ever have on television.  That's right.  Let's go to Mike in Cleveland.  Mike?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Can you just say none on us?  We're artists.  None on us.  How much responsibility do we have for him getting fired, Opie? 
[00:53:00]  None.  I think Norton's just ticked because no one's going around yelling, Jimmy Norton, party rock.  There you have it.  I'm not ticked, sir.  Thanks, Mike.  Actually, that was an Anthony quote, none on us, right?  Yeah.  None on us.  So then I guess The Current Affair aired another piece on this yesterday.  But we're stupid.  We're stupid to get our names out there.  Of course we are.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I can't wait to hear that.  So they did another something on this yesterday.  I think they had a poll or something.  Yeah.  Welcome back to A Current Affair. 
[00:53:30]  Now, on Friday, we had a phone and website poll asking whether you thought CBS should have  fired local New York reporter Arthur Chen for accidentally muttering the F word live on  air when two morons interrupted him from behind.  Here's what you said.  Of the 89,940 of you who voted, 77% said no, CBS should not have fired Arthur.  And 23% said yes, Arthur deserved to get the boot.  Where is the love?  What? 
[00:54:00]  This guy's got charisma.  I'll say that.  Full of spunk.  All right, then.  Where is the love?  We're trying to get through some of this.  We could be playing audio clips about this all morning, by the way.  You know what?  That was interesting.  He did a report on the reparter.  Did this asshole go back and redo it?  You're not live, stupid.  Reparter.  Reparter.  It's Tim Green.  He's absolutely...  I mean, you've got to watch A Current Affair to see how just stiff this guy is to begin  with.  And, you know, A Current Affair was a huge, huge show back in the day.  You'd think they would have found a guy with a little more charisma to be able to pull 
[00:54:30]  this new version off.  A Current Affair started the whole tabloid journalism.  This guy is the worst, and he won't last.  I'm telling you.  He stinks.  Bill O'Reilly used to host A Current Affair also.  That's right.  After Maury left.  Here's our good pal, Imus.  I haven't heard this yet.  I have no idea what he said about this.  CBS News reporter Arthur Chan was fired yesterday.  He used the F word on the air during the 6 a.m. broadcast.  Oh, what would have prompted him to do that?  He was standing in front of a subway station delivering a live intro to this segment 
[00:55:00]  about MetroCard scams.  And two guys walk up behind him and hold up a sign and began chanting Opie and Anthony.  And so he thought he'd finish the live report, according to Page Six.  He whirled around and blurted out to the interlopers, what the blank is your problem, man?  Oh, here's the F word, man.  He did.  That's great.  On TV.  It's on TV.  It's time.  Hammer was rolling, according to Page Six. 
[00:55:30]  And it's live.  It ran loud and clear over the interlopers.  Quote.  Is this something that Opie and Anthony put him up to?  The Page Six report does not say that.  One can only hope that's the case.  The guy made a mistake.  Take it easy.  Yeah.  We have automatically a curbside execution of old poor Arthur Chan.  That's one mistake.  Nuclear option error.  What the F is wrong with WCBS?  Take it easy.  Yeah, calm down, man.  All right, see, everyone, obviously the guy should not have been fired.  The guy should not have been fired. 
[00:56:00]  The people that look most ridiculous in this situation is CBS.  CBS News.  They fire the guy.  By the way, this is reminding me of a few other assaults on the media.  And what is it?  I miss broadcasting from the shuttle?  Yeah, we got the worst audio clip there.  Maybe we...  That's, uh, one of the...  Beep.  All right, we have a tranquility base.  Uh, uh, the, uh, the, uh...  Shut up, jerk.  The, uh, eagle has landed.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  What, they fire him?  What?  You get out on the moon.  I'm not going out on there.  I got...  I can't fit the space helmet on my big, uh, cowboy hat.  How am I supposed to wear my cowboy hat when I'm wearing a, uh, a space helmet?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Oops.  What the hell was that clip?  I don't know, man.  You can hear her fine, and I miss it somewhere, uh... 
[00:57:00]  Somewhere in space.  ...bounds of miles above the Earth.  He's just bouncing around doing his show.  Don't forget to, uh, pick up some of my brother's salsa when you're, uh, here on Mars.  Broadcasting from, uh, Venus next week.  Oh, too good.  All right, now we got some audio from the Todd Schnitt.  Is it Schnitt or Schmidt?  His name alone could be an FCC violation.  That's right.  Oh, shit, goodness.  Every day he's sweating, just trying to get through his name. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, this is Tom's shit.  Bah, bah, bah!  I did it again!  Shit!  I bet that's not even his name.  That's probably a fancy showbiz name.  I'm Schnitts.  All right, well, I had to change it from Schnitzburg.  When my family came here.  From Poland.  From Poland.  It was Schnitz and Bergenstein of it.  Uh, where's this guy from? 
[00:58:00]  Out of Tampa.  Out of Tampa.  All right, out of Tampa, Anthony.  Right.  Let's take a listen here.  Turns out these were a bunch of goons.  I don't know whether they were employees or they were just, uh, you know, unemployed,  uh, Opie and Anthony listeners.  But, uh, Opie and Anthony, the, uh, shock jock radio show, which used to be on the air in  New York City, until they got canned.  Because, remember, Opie and Anthony, they were the, uh, this, uh, I, I know he's going  to go off in trashes.  I, and I swear.  No!  He sounds like he's gearing up for a compliment, Opie. 
[00:58:30]  This guy sounds good.  But these guys, what amazes me is that these guys don't realize they're playing into our  hands.  They're just playing into our hands over and over again.  Because this guy thinks he's too cool for the room.  Know how many people are going to go, Opie and Anthony?  Well, A, I didn't know they were back on radio.  B, they sound interesting.  I've got to get this XM now.  This is just getting us more people to, uh, to join the program.  Thank you.  Why are you playing right into it every single time?  Why are you trying to, I don't want to, why are we trying to go head to head with Tom 
[00:59:00]  Schnitz?  Can we just play the audio without upsetting this guy anymore, please?  I don't need Tom Schnitz coming after us.  Opie and Anthony, they were the, uh, imbeciles that had, uh, two listeners have sex in St.  Patrick's Cathedral.  Yeah, that's class.  I mean, it goes, uh, that goes just beyond, uh, any even acceptable form of shock jock  radio.  Yeah.  Listen, shock jock radio, a little shock, a little edginess, that doesn't bother me at  all.  Wow.  Good. 
[00:59:30]  I'm having two listeners have...  Tough guy.  Hey, a little edginess.  Hey.  I'm right there with you.  I'm all for a little fun.  I'll have you back.  I don't like the way, by the way, Alan Sniffin said that, uh, you know, that's what anybody  would do when they see it.  Well, that's what happened in that shirt.  I mean, come on.  What are you doing, you see a nice ass?  You ass?  You fucking...  Anybody would have had the same problem.  Hey, when I'm, uh, you know, a shock jockery, a little shock jockery, I'm right with you.  It's Tom Schnitzin. 
[01:00:00]  Tom Schnitzin.  Tom or Todd?  What is it?  Todd Schnitzin.  Todd?  Todd Schnitzin.  I swear to you, I've never heard of this guy.  No one has.  We're playing right into his hands, Opie.  You should get larynx cancer.  You know, you might, you might think that, but, uh, you know, I mean, he's in a little  market.  Yeah.  You know, the, the beauty of doing a national talk show and you start talking about the  people and they could, you know, it's not like people in New York could go get the Todd  Schnitz show.  That's where... 
[01:00:30]  Schnitz?  Huh?  Oh.  I thought you cursed.  Schnitz.  It's a good drinking beer.  Who is this?  Who is this?  Is this Schnitz or Schnitzin?  Schnitzin.  What's his name?  I would love to know how many people in Tampa signed up for XM just because they heard Todd  of Schnitz talking about this incident.  Schnitz.  Jesus.  Schnitz.  I bet he has clever segments like, hey, in our bullschnitt section, we're going to talk  today about...  Ugh.  I'm speaking of my last name on somebody's chest. 
[01:01:00]  Bullschnitt.  Can you drop a schnitz on my chest?  Jesus.  You know he does something stupid like that.  Let's get back to the...  You're full of me.  Oh, Todd.  Having two listeners have sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral, that's just over the top.  And they were out of work for, what, a couple of years?  I think they were out for two years.  Then one of the satellite channels picked them up.  And I guess they're on a mission or they have a mission for listeners to harass television 
[01:01:30]  live shots.  Apparently that's the deal.  So there were two guys that were holding up this Opie and Anthony radio sign behind this  reporter.  The guy's name, Arthur Chien.  And Arthur was doing this report.  It was 6 a.m.  It was like 6.01.  And the anchor at WCBS, Channel 2 in New York, goes to Arthur Chien.  And he's standing there. 
[01:02:00]  He's doing his little rap.  So I guess he's opening up the story live.  Then they're going to throw it to a recorded piece.  And then he'd come back and do the, and that's it from here, reporting live from some subway  steps.  I'm Arthur Chien.  Channel 2 News, or whatever the heck you would say.  But the guys behind him were holding up the sign.  They were also like screaming the Opie and Anthony.  They also flicked off the camera right behind him.  I mean, he didn't even like wait like three seconds for them to cut to the package. 
[01:02:30]  He just whips around.  You know, he ends his sentence live on the air.  And was that what?  Was that even a quarter of a second that he whips around and says, what the bleep's your  problem, man?  What the bleep?  God fired.  And don't forget, you can get your what the fuck is your problem, man t-shirts outside  the studio today.  Listeners are lining up as we speak.  That's right.  Sometime after 9 o'clock, we'll be handing out the t-shirts, Anthony.  Yep.  That's why Club Soda Kenny is here. 
[01:03:00]  We're actually waiting for the FedEx man to deliver them.  Oh, they're not here yet?  No.  That's why we had to wait.  Ooh.  But there's Todd Schnitt playing right into our hands.  Sounding a lot like Don from Don and Mike.  Yeah, and a little Tom Likas in there, too.  Tom Likas, yeah.  And a little Likas in there.  I like that realistic laugh.  And then.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, if anybody wants to maybe make a couple of phone calls to a schnitz show and record  it, we'll play it.  Because those are always fun when the listeners do that. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Let's see if Todd Schnitt.  Let's see if Todd Schnitt could handle the O&A Army.  Doug out, Doug.  Yeah.  Attack!  Oh, I love you guys.  What a good birthday present.  Let her rip, kids.  I was going to say, you know, he's talking about the thing that all the fans do with  the assault on the media.  I think we should show him what serious questions really are.  I agree.  Serious questions only, people.  You guys have no idea.  You never want our pests attacking you.  And you know it was really, what is it, 3 o'clock?  3 p.m.  3 p.m. 
[01:04:00]  Let's see if he has the balls to take on our listeners.  Is that the call-in number?  Yeah.  1-800-801-8999.  Right.  For those people now that have a pen, it's 1-800-801-8999.  And it's weekdays, 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern.  So, serious questions only.  And, you know, I wouldn't call up and try to use his wacky name in some part of your call. 
[01:04:30]  Things like that.  But Mike is saying he's ultra-conservative?  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  Well, I also want to go to Hollywood real fast.  Hollywood, go ahead.  Hey, O&A.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I lived in Tampa, and this guy, he's using his real name now.  But before, he used to go by MJ and BJ.  His name was MJ.  A couple weeks ago, you guys were talking about a guy that did Wacky Voices, the crotchety  old man.  This is the guy that did the CD, and he would always call up with that punchline, oh, thank 
[01:05:00]  God, you answered bullshit.  Oh, yeah.  I remember we played one of those.  We heard one of those.  I don't even remember.  Really?  It was atrocious.  Okay.  Yeah.  This guy, back in the day on FLV 93.3 back in Tampa, they used to do a morning show, and  then his sidekick went, I think, to Cincinnati and left him out to dry.  And then, I mean, this guy is just horrible.  I mean, the whole CD is just horrible.  So, did he do, like, shock jock type stuff?  They tried to. 
[01:05:30]  See, that's what's going on with this whole FCC thing.  A lot of these guys that did the shock radio are now making believe they never did it.  Mancow's a classic example.  They're now trying to claim that his bosses made him do all the stuff he did back in the  day.  And they're trying to change their image, because, you know, they have to survive in the radio  climate that is now out there.  And here's another phony making believe he never did any shocking radio before.  Shock jock.  Because the radio station he was on, they did the morning show, and then later on that 
[01:06:00]  evening was at Bubba the Love Sponge.  So, it was that shock jock type of radio station.  Hip-hop bullshit.  All right.  And now he's ultra-conservative, because that's what all these guys are now doing.  They go from shocking to now trying to be the next Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity.  I haven't heard his show in a while, but I still think he does his morning FM show, and  then he goes and does his, he's got like a small little syndicated throughout Florida  AM show.  Right. 
[01:06:30]  So, punch it out, guys.  Well, good luck to the schnitzer.  Snapman from Whackbag says he thinks before MJ he called himself a schnitzbuckley.  Weird.  Maybe on some station up in New York.  Let's go to Fort Lee.  Eric, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Morning, Eric.  Hey, I was listening to K-Rock on Friday.  They tried to do their own spin on it.  I think Kane was on the air, and he said the reason why the guy cursed, the reporter cursed 
[01:07:00]  is because Cabby was behind him that he showed him the finger, and that's why the reason that  the guy said, you know, what's your problem?  Well, there's another interesting angle to this whole thing, like we said.  You know, Crazy Cabby.  They have it on camera.  They have Cabby on camera.  Crazy Cabby, which is one of Howard Stern's cronies, you know, was involved in this because  he was walking by as Nathaniel was doing this, and Howard doesn't even acknowledge it.  Nah.  Way to do real radio, Howard. 
[01:07:30]  Big, huge radio story, and you just shut your little trap.  How can you take credit for anything you did there?  There's nothing there that mentions any other radio station or program, you know, or, sorry.  It's just Opie and Anthony.  That's all you get from that video is Opie and Anthony.  Well, it looks like, obviously, the press picked it up.  It looks like two fans walking up with a sign.  It was, really.  I mean, one intern plus one fan.  Yeah.  That's exactly what it was.  It is exactly how it is.  I'm not a fan.  You know, I mean, Cabby's going to make believe he's not a fan of this show. 
[01:08:00]  Please.  How many times did he kiss our ass outside the building over there when we were going in  for meetings?  Cabby, I don't think, was talking.  No, he's just, uh, Cabby's just trying to get into the subway.  Yeah, and I think in fairness to Cabby, he wasn't flipping the bird off the channel, too.  He was flipping the bird off to the radio show.  Right, to the sign.  He's just like, whatever, to these guys.  Yeah, he was pointing it on the sign.  Only Cabby.  Only Cabby.  That's good stuff.  Wow, it's all over the internet if you want to look for it.  It's pretty funny. 
[01:08:30]  You know who was doing the show with him?  Al Dukes.  He used to kiss my ass on a daily basis.  That's Al Dukes?  Yeah, Al Dukes.  Who's going to also make believe he's not a fan of the Opie and Anthony show?  Are you insane?  And by the way, do you notice the, again, once again, the incestuous tie-in?  Let the Viacom employees say that the other Viacom employee was not giving the finger  to a Viacom employee.  Giving it to the sign.  Yes.  Well.  Damn you, sign!  Did his wrists spin around so his fingernail was pointing at the sign, or was it pointing 
[01:09:00]  at the camera?  Well, I don't know if you know it, but they've dropped the fine because Janet Jackson was only  showing her tit to Justin Timberlake.  No one cares.  Stupid.  It got out over the air.  It was his dirty Viacom finger.  Got a little more on this.  Arthur Chiena, Channel 2, fired for dropping the F-bomb.  I just want to know what was going through his head, like if he thought it was a pre-taped  thing.  I think he thought they immediately cut to video.  That's Al Dukes.  He's good.  That's Al Dukes, who used to kiss our ass on a daily basis. 
[01:09:30]  Actually bought me a pinball machine because he wanted to work for our show, and I smashed  it right in front of his face.  We should get that video back up on opianthony.com.  Does he have his own show now on K-Rock?  I guess they've teamed him up with Booker or something.  I don't even know.  He's Booker's producer.  But he's, you know, always jumping on for a little later.  I like Al.  He's all right.  He stinks.  He's a good radio personality.  A pre-taped thing?  I think he thought they immediately cut to video.  Yeah, but they don't.  They hold you there forever. 
[01:10:00]  He knows that.  He's done it a million times.  Well, why not just say, what's your problem?  Yeah, exactly.  But you know, when you're just all hot like that, you're trying to do that.  You're trying to do your job.  You're out there, and it's tough.  I do these things in the street every now and again.  And when I used to do it for Entertainment Tonight, it was the worst.  Because if you do anything in the street, just forget about it.  All right.  All right, this guy's got a comment.  I mean, if you didn't see the video yet, I should recap it.  There were some guys with signs.  They were holding them up.  And Cabby, of course, kind of bum-rushed their thing with the middle finger,  flew the bird during Arthur Cheehan's broadcast. 
[01:10:30]  Then, of course, Arthur Cheehan...  He didn't bum-rush it.  No one's talking about Crazy Cabby from the Howard Stern Show.  We got to point that out.  It's hilarious.  Bum-rush.  The whole media is talking about how Opie and Anthony did this.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Can't you just be honest in your broadcast?  No one's honest there.  Be honest out there.  There's a Howard Stern angle, and Howard chose not even to talk about it.  A huge radio story.  Dope.  Arthur Cheehan's broadcast.  Then, of course, Arthur Cheehan curses at the end.  It's like a double whammy. 
[01:11:00]  It's F-bombs all over Channel 2.  It's just fantastic.  So, Cabby, you can see him in the video in his getaway, his pseudo-getaway.  He's like running down the subway stairs.  This guy's got a theory on it.  Yeah, Booker, why are you so surprised on, like, Cabby's behavior?  Good point.  If he sees the camera, if it's anything to do with media, he's going to make himself sound like a jackass, and he doesn't even care what kind of publicity he's going to put out.  I just love that the guy's going to jail, and, like, he's still, it hasn't changed his attitude. 
[01:11:30]  The greatest thing is, like, I see the subway station.  It's right up the street, so he was obviously coming off the air because Sean Gables is on the air, so it's got to be, like, 6.05 in the morning.  So he's just getting finished with the shift right then, and he would have to cross the street to get to this subway hole that he went down into.  You know what I mean?  It's not the closest one to the radio station.  So you're right.  He did see what was happening, and he wanted to be involved.  So you're right about that.  And that's Cabby.  That's Cabby.  That's why I love him.  He's so funny. 
[01:12:00]  And you wonder why he gets a 2 o'clock shift in the morning.  Yeah, well, I still think they should move that up.  All right.  Take care, buddy.  Wow.  This is all edited.  That was edited to shit because, obviously, they cut out any reference to Opie and Anthony.  Right.  That's hilarious, right?  I'm sure the caller was saying Opie and Anthony so you could hear where he has to edit it because he's not allowed, probably, to say our names.  Listen for that on the replay.  What fucking fraudulent.  Who is listening to that horrendous radio show? 
[01:12:30]  That was really boring.  That is god awful.  That was really boring.  Yeah, he's just crazy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's going to jail.  He's the same guy.  Hey, nothing's changed.  Nothing's changed.  Maybe a big black cock in his ass will change him.  Maybe then he'll have a little more manners when he gets out.  I'll tell you what'll change.  In fact, he'll start paying taxes.  Pay up, boy.  Stop welching.  Stop riding our backs.  I didn't like how they spun it, so it's like almost as if I weren't there, Cabby would have done that anyway because he's just so crazy. 
[01:13:00]  Because he's crazy.  He's got crazy in his name.  And that's so dishonest because anyone that checked out the video or read the newspaper articles on it, the AP story, I mean, it had nothing to do with him.  No one mentioned him.  Why aren't they talking about Wacky Fan?  It's all Crazy Cabby.  How about Wacky Fan?  Oh, that's good.  The Wacky Fan and Crazy Cabby show.  Yeah, and once again, Howard Stern showing that he is indeed just a pussy. 
[01:13:30]  Just a pussy.  Showing him up again.  Had nothing to say.  And one of his guys was, quote, involved.  He's just crazy.  Rubbing the middle finger.  I have bombs all over the place.  Yuck.  Unlistenable.  Well, Anthony, I think, Nathaniel, I think this is one of the top three assaults on the media ever.  I believe.  Top three ever.  Well, let's think of some of the ones that have been done, and I think the videos are now up on opianthony.com.  The classic, of course, assault on the media when the A-bomb was dropped. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, the C-word.  The C-word.  The video is now back up on opianthony.com.  I haven't seen that in a while, but basically.  C-word always beats F-word.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Someone, well, someone, we know who it was.  It was Psycho Mark held up, yeah, held up the C-word on live TV.  Big sign right behind.  And Melissa Russo.  Melissa Russo.  She was working for Channel 4.  Is she still there?  I've seen her from time to time.  But there's a sign behind her as she's doing a story from Times Square. 
[01:14:30]  Where the hell was she?  It was 8th Avenue and 47th Street, yeah.  On top of the van.  And that was the time, yeah.  The assaults on the media back in the day got so out of control, in New York especially,  that the reporters started doing their live shots from on top of the news vans.  Yeah, they climbed up there with the camera and did it from there so the street level  people couldn't get behind the camera.  Right.  But Psycho Mark.  Got on someone's shoulders or something like that.  Got on someone's shoulders, held up a big sign with the C-word written on it and just  held it up behind her. 
[01:15:00]  So as she's doing the story, you're distracted by the C-word, the atom bomb of all curse words  right behind her head.  So that video's up.  That's going to get a lot of hits today.  And then also there was the Today Show flashing, huge, with the WOW sticker, way before Janet  Jackson.  Oh, your pals did it first.  The girl completely exposed on the Today Show as they're panning the line in the morning  with a huge Open Anthony, well, whatever, a WOW sticker on her chest. 
[01:15:30]  Well, it was kind of like under her boobs.  Yeah.  Yeah, because her boobs were not covered.  No, they were completely exposed.  And remember, Howard tried to claim responsibility for that.  I had a tire bandana around a nude woman.  He was like, that was us.  And then all of a sudden people had him whisper to Howard, Howard, the girl had an Open Anthony  sticker on.  Yeah.  Ah, well, it was still my guys that did that.  What?  Oh, yeah.  He tried to take responsibility for that.  And now...  Put it later.  And now Nathaniel's thing is right up there now, too. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'm glad to be among the greats.  Also, we got the video up of me smashing Al Dukes' stupid pinball machine.  It's a classic.  I think Danny's up there in the top 400, though.  I mean, that was a pretty good one.  When he held that O and the A got on camera and the half of a caricature, I'm like, wow.  Oh, Jesus.  He did a great assault on the media if you have a letterbox television.  You widescreen idiot getting the shot.  We were very excited, though, I remember. 
[01:16:30]  It was all about Danny until Nathaniel came to the plate.  Just stole his thunder.  Oh, man, did he steal his thunder.  Can I see the hits on the two assaults on the media by the interns?  Let's start with Danny.  How many hits has Danny's assault on the media gotten?  Oh, my God, you can't even find it anymore in the list of files you can download.  It's just buried now.  It's just buried.  Where's Danny's assault on the media?  All right, here we go.  Danny, to date.  It's right under Steve the Whistler's appearance. 
[01:17:00]  Danny, to date, has gotten 9,842 hits.  That's very respectable.  Yes.  Very respectable.  That was last Monday, I believe, a week ago today.  And then Nathaniel came to the plate last Thursday.  And it's a different story.  He's up to 124,907 downloads.  Oh, wow.  That is sad. 
[01:17:30]  Nice job, Interloper.  Thank you.  You're going places, son.  You're going places.  He had the Revenge of the Sith weekend.  Breaking all kinds of records.  Oh, man, I saw Star Wars.  We can get into that next.  Yes.  Rich Voss is here.  We're supposed to continue the first show we ever did.  Rich is here?  Yeah, Voss.  I saw him outside.  And, of course, don't forget to pick up your collector item T-shirt today, Anthony.  Wow.  No schnit. 
[01:18:00]  What the fuck is your problem, man?  T-shirt.  Outside the studio today, we're just going to hand these things out.  All right.  All right.  Wonderful.  We've got to take our first break.  It's been a long morning already.  I've got a tinkle-ope.  I'm hoping we get more audio clips from these dopes talking about this assault on the media.  They play right into our hands.  Right into them.  What do you think is going on over at the news?  Agencies, various networks.  Do you think they're having meetings saying, look, watch out? 
[01:18:30]  Of course.  The memos went out.  Of course.  And these won't stop, people.  These will not stop.  We will search out live shots.  We know how this works.  We were waiting for one of these to get major exposure, and now it's just going to be a feeding frenzy out there.  It's just going to get ugly now.  And it doesn't just have to be heroes like Nathaniel out there in the trenches.  Anybody that sees a live shot, if you can whip up a sign really quickly and pop that behind the camera, that's all we ask. 
[01:19:00]  No harassing of the reporter.  Don't touch them.  You don't touch him at all.  You just get back there and, you know, hey, ONA, XM Satellite Radio.  Hold up the sign, and your mission is accomplished.  If you can get the guy fired like Nathaniel did, all the better, I guess.  That's right.  Who cares if his children aren't going to eat so you can get a little face time?  That's the matter, Stan.  That's the important thing.  Good boy.  We also have Francine here who wants to do the news.  Oh, really?  Cool.  Maybe we could do that next, get a little news, because there's a lot going on in the world as well. 
[01:19:30]  And we're going to learn about that?  All right.  I don't know.  She's good.  Her news is the wet bagel.  It's the same thing.  Where is Ricky?  I haven't seen that boy since you...  I dressed him down.  I sure did.  You gave him a talking to.  A talking to.  And perhaps a bit more.  And I noticed that Travis Bagel was...  It was delicious.  It was fine, right?  Like a martini.  It was wonderful.  It was perfectly toasted.  Nice and warm still.  Max in Dallas.  What's up, Max?  Keep it short, buddy. 
[01:20:00]  Keep it short.  Danny's Assault is the puppy that got ran over by Nathaniel's SUV.  Touch now, boys.  Oh, like little Rudy in the driveway.  You bet.  You know, because you know Danny was checking out 9,000.  That's not bad.  You figure he's using the same Eric Logan.  Three people per assault.  That's almost 30,000 people.  A lot of these people, you download a video clip, you call your friend over.  You go, hey, check this out.  You email it.  Right.  So it's not just like that many people are watching. 
[01:20:30]  You know, out of those 9,000 downloads, probably 5,000 are Danny and his family.  You see his mom and dad and his family.  Oh, boy.  Half of them are like, this isn't the F-bomb one.  No one curses on this one.  Where's the good one?  Just our dumb son just running around with a sign that doesn't get on camera.  It's just like him holding up an O.  Do you work for Cheerios?  You want a Honey Nut Cheerios commercial idiot?  Oh, wait. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  You know what?  Someone just reminded us of another assault on the media that we're playing right now in studio here.  Are you going to get this up on opandanthony.com, too?  This one is, I got to tell you, the Today Show flashing was unbelievable.  The C-word thing was unbelievable.  What Nathaniel did was obviously unbelievable.  We all forgot about, what was his name, Maury Alter.  Maury Alter.  Maury Alter, outside the David Letterman studio.  I guess this was when Dave was having his heart problems, and it was either his first day back or, I don't know, 
[01:21:30]  when the story was breaking that he was going to have open heart surgery or whatever.  And all of a sudden, it was an icy night in New York City.  So, a couple of dopes.  You got to call them.  No, actually, they're not called heads.  They're heroes, actually.  Two heads.  Have you ever seen this, Jimmy?  Oh, my God, watch this.  I know this is radio, but you can see the video for yourself later today.  They knock into Maury because the sidewalk is icy, and Maury's still trying to do his stand-up outside the Late Show Theater. 
[01:22:00]  And in the background, I don't want to call it a fight, but just a disturbance.  A scuffle.  A disturbance and a scuffle's going on as they're trying to pull the wow sign away from the guys that did this assault on the media.  Look at the security jumps out of the news van.  The door flies open.  Security comes running out.  And he got through his story.  Yeah, Maury didn't turn around and start cursing.  I remember what he did.  All of a sudden, the camera guy's like, screw Maury.  Look what's going on. 
[01:22:30]  And the camera guy focuses on what's happening behind Maury.  And Maury actually said something to this effect.  He goes, back on me.  He's like, no, come back on me.  Come back on me.  Back on me.  And he finished his story like a professional.  The sidewalk was so icy that these guys wanted to do the quick assault.  They want to run, show the sign, and get out.  They want to run up behind Maury, put the sign up, and then run away.  So they run up to him.  And the sidewalk is so icy, they slide right into him.  He's trying to do his story.  And they bang into him. 
[01:23:00]  And then they're trying to run away on the icy sidewalk.  And that's when all hell broke loose.  Security came running out.  They were yelling.  I forgot that's one of my favorites.  They come running out of the news truck.  Yep.  And then they grab the sign.  There's like a tug of war going on and stuff.  That was a fun one.  And they got away.  So there you go.  Was that Psycho Mark?  It was Psycho Mark again?  Come on, years later.  We can say who it is.  All right.  It's opiananthony.com.  We got the A-bomb now up again.  The Today Show flashing.  And now the Maury alter assault for you folks that have never seen those videos. 
[01:23:30]  You know what was a great assault on the media?  It was that time on Tough Crowd when your old pal had that 25-minute shirt.  On TV.  That's right.  Is that not a good one?  That was a very, very good one.  Because everyone concentrates on those two big tits when they see the O.P. and Anthony  name.  Aha.  Boy, then.  But I noticed when you were on Leno, you didn't have the O.P. and Anthony t-shirt.  Yeah.  Nor will I in June when I do it again.  All right.  We got to take a break, man.  That's right.  We're going to be running. 
[01:24:00]  By the way, just for fairness sake, Danny, this weekend, there was someone in his family  who was having a party, and they held up a video camera, and he ran in with an O.P. and  Anthony sticker and showed it on that video camera.  So that's floating around.  Actually, all you can see is what?  Danny's obsessed, though.  I think Danny's going to come back strong.  You just watch.  You just watch.  Kidnap a kid, some Amber Alert thing. 
[01:24:30]  Creep.  Creep.  I think we should take the rest of the day off.  We did an hour and a half of radio for everybody.  It's Austin already.  Can I say something off the subject?  I was howling all weekend looking at the Photoshopped on Whack Bag.  What a bunch of creeps.  And just one of the guys' sig pic is a picture.  His name is Jean Benet.  And the little name under it says, Mama's Little Bungie Bag.  Jesus.  Oh, what an asshole.  Oh, I howled when I saw that.  Some of the funniest things are the sig pics and then the little comments. 
[01:25:00]  They're just the rudest.  And there's one guy out there who's just an absolute racist.  You know what I mean?  All he does is racist shit.  There are some creeps.  Is he called Voss?  No.  Oh, God.  We love these pests.  We love our pests.  It is really, really funny to read, man.  All right.  We got to regroup.  We'll talk about Star Wars.  We'll talk about Colorado.  Mama's Little Bungie Bag.  Little? 
[01:25:30]  Was it spelled L-I-L?  Oh, L-I-L.  Yeah, of course.  And we have to talk about Jimmy's gay painters.  You have to.  That was hilarious.  Just helping him out.  Yeah, we'll get into that next.  Helping like.  And we'll get Rich Voss in here next as well.  Lots to do on the Opie and Anthony program today.  Once again, though, Anthony, don't forget to get your What the Fuck Is Your Problem Man t-shirts.  Man, is it What the Fuck Is Your Problem, comma, man?  Yeah, question mark.  Is that how it's written?  I hope they did it right.  I haven't seen one of the shirts yet.  Are they here yet, Steve? 
[01:26:00]  We'll get an update to see if the shirts are actually here, Anthony.  Send Danny down to sign for it.  Dan, you sit here and relax.  By the way, if you're wandering around New York City trying to find us, we're on 57th Street and like 6th Avenue, kind of.  You'll see kind of a line of tens.  Line in the tens of people, of course.  I think we made double digits with people waiting in line for these great collector item t-shirts.  Are they on their way?  I hope. 
[01:26:30]  We'll find out next.  Oh, you know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, you know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no, I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cup right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Maybe bang me up the ass.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me. 
[01:27:00]  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the T-F-ing.  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite oral treat.  My favorite eating cock.  I'm hungry for a big, fat, juicy cock.  That's the right.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag. 
[01:27:30]  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Shoot your big wad of cum right into my mouth.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  Oh, God.  After I talk you off, I want you to bang me up the ass.  I'm hungry for a hard-mailed cock.  Yes.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass. 
[01:28:00]  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear.  I'm a freak.  That's what I was taught.  I got a big, juicy cock from Ben the other day.  Oh.  I like the banana.  Oh, God.  I like the banana.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with a guy.  I enjoy something in my mouth.  I enjoy cock between the boobs.  I enjoy cock in my tight ass.  Hi, hi, hi.  That's what they call me.  Hi, hi, hi.  She's a freak. 
[01:28:30]  Hi, hi, hi.  That's what they call me.  Hi, hi, hi.  She's a freak.  Bird movie and Anthony Schell.  She's a freak.  She can't destroy.  She's a freak.  She can't destroy.  She's a freak. 
[01:29:00]  She can't destroy.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks for checking out the program today.  The OA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  What's up, Jimmy?  Just not to be depressing, but a good friend, a guy from Kirkmark and Lopez in Baltimore.  Lopez died of cancer. 
[01:29:30]  We knew he was sick for a while.  He was a great guy.  They do a really funny morning show.  And we were booted off the air.  They were one of the only radio shows that was really welcoming and nice and didn't shy  away from the mention of Opie and Anthony.  They were just really cool guys.  So, I mean, he was a great dude, man.  And, you know, I'm just sorry that he's dead.  I'm sorry for that whole show.  I believe Anthony and I met him in L.A. about 10 years ago.  And if it's the guy I'm thinking of, he was very, very cool to us.  Yeah, he was great, man.  Very cool to us.  That's a drag.  Yeah, it sucks. 
[01:30:00]  He's young, too.  52 to die of cancer.  Lopez is survived by his wife, Jean, and his daughter, Leandra.  In lieu of flowers, the Leandra Lopez Scholarship Fund has been established.  Correspondents may be sent to Bank of America 5550 or 0, sorry.  Okay, 5550 Friendship Boulevard, first floor, Chevy Chase, Maryland, 20815, attention, T. Wilson.  What an awful address. 
[01:30:30]  It really is.  I know.  Well, you can get it on the replay.  Or, I mean, a lot of people are taping these shows through their MyFi.  They'll get it.  Well, go to their website because that is a long address.  If you're driving, you didn't get any of that.  Yeah, I know.  At the Friendship Boulevard, you gave up.  What's the website?  It's 98 Rock in Baltimore.  Okay.  So, I honestly don't know the website.  But look up 98 Rock, Kirk, Mark, and Lopez.  All right, man.  That sucks.  Yeah, he was a great guy.  And now Rich Fox.  And now, well, yeah.  Jesus.  I was in there two weeks ago.  Those guys were cool. 
[01:31:00]  That's what started that whole check.  You call around for the radio stations.  Oh, really?  That's the show I was on.  That was the show?  Except he wasn't in the studio.  He was doing it from home by that point.  But that was the show when you guys kind of tuned in.  He was still doing radio only a couple weeks ago when you were on?  Dude, he was.  Or about a month ago, I think we did that.  Yeah, the guy was from home.  Oh, my God.  I asked the end line.  He would talk.  And then he would have to pause a little bit.  You could kind of hear the difference.  Yeah.  But, yeah, he wasn't in the studio when I was there.  Yeah, keep smoking, boss.  Yeah, you've got to quit, Rich.  I've been bugging you about cigarettes, bro.  You've got to quit smoking.  No, just keep doing it. 
[01:31:30]  Nothing will happen to you.  He was five years older than you.  I know.  You'll be the one.  You'll be the one that nothing happens to you.  That's right.  Surgeon General's wrong.  Everyone but 50-year-old Jews with perfect hands and white teeth.  You're finished.  Why don't you stop?  You'll be the one that takes on cancer and wins.  You'll be the guy.  That's right.  Because you beat the odds.  Right.  On a lighter note, I was in the bathroom.  Jim, I'm telling you, for such a mess, he has such a nice mule.  He showed it to me.  You were looking over at him?  I was looking over.  He came running at me with it. 
[01:32:00]  No, here's what happened.  I was peeing.  Running at you with it?  I was peeing, and fucking Hawk popped in for a second.  And then I ran back out.  So when Hawk ran out, I was done pissing.  I turned around.  And I said, hey, where are you going?  And I started walking towards the door, and my, well, what I like to call the baby wrecker  was hanging out.  And when I saw him do that, walking with his penis out in the bathroom, I thought I was  in the rest area on the parkway.  Is that why you knelt down, stupid?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I spit him out faster than that. 
[01:32:30]  By the way, the website is 98online.com.  Cool.  Don't spell out 98.  Yes, the number.  Exactly.  We got Drew Boogie in studio as well.  And I was just handed Anthony a Gray Wolf-Drew Boogie-Shelter-Me remix.  Yeah, you remember the, uh...  Whoa, hey.  Oh, easy there, Drew.  Oh, you got a booming voice.  Let me turn you down a little bit, Drew.  I'm going to pull that down.  Yes, pull that down.  Only voice and a Ricky mustache.  I have to hide a blemish.  Leave me alone, Jim. 
[01:33:00]  You're hiding something behind that mustache?  Yeah, man.  You know, I tried using a new razor, and I shaved my, you know.  Oh, I thought you meant your sexuality.  Oh, easy.  Easy.  Wow.  You're a rapper?  No.  Not at all.  I'm sorry, Joe.  You said you like when we slam you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So don't beat me up.  Yeah, that's a close name.  All right, what's going on?  Remember the Gray Wolf, when he came in here and played that little song for Tippi Tom?  I just wanted to see what it sounded like with some music behind it.  So I decided to put some music behind it and see what happened. 
[01:33:30]  And, you know, it came out kind of nice.  It was like, you know, maybe the show could use a little bit of filler.  You know how you guys like that.  Don't tell anyone.  When do you get the time to do this?  Oh, it only took me a couple hours, you know, before work.  Yeah, but I mean, between all the mustache grooming.  Holy shit, Drew, I hate you right now.  Wow.  You have no idea what you just did.  Wow.  You have no fucking idea.  Anthony knows.  Jimmy knows.  And he certainly knows.  Uh-oh.  He was ready to bomb and you saved his ass.  He was so ready to just bomb.  He's like, so what do you do? 
[01:34:00]  And he had nothing.  I had.  And you jumped right in.  I was like, yeah.  I was asking a regular question.  You weren't asking a regular question.  You spent the time to do that while, and then it was going to be some smart-ass remark about  you doing something else.  But he had nothing, and he knows it.  But he had nothing.  And you bailed him out.  I still have yet to get it over here.  I stink.  No, no, no.  You just didn't realize this mumbling idiot was about to fire out, like, nothing.  We know Voss and his timing.  And if he had something, he would have spit it out. 
[01:34:30]  But when his, like, head, whenever Voss's head moves or his hands start to move, this  dummy has got nothing.  I'll watch him.  When his head goes, he's, like, thinking.  And when his hands get stiff and he moves them up and down like he's about to make a  point, it's a dumb point.  Bombing is wrong.  Don't kill people.  Well, pretty poignant.  All right.  Get ahead there, Drew.  Well, I just decided, you know, it sounded like a nice little ditty for Tippi Tom when he  eventually dies of the consumption.  Okay.  Assumption, yes.  So, you know, that's what happens when you use your body like a sewage treatment plant. 
[01:35:00]  This is called Shelter Me?  Shelter Me.  That's not when you live.  Thanks.  Just a little something.  Nothing too major.  Yeah, that's what he says about all his masterpieces.  This guy knows how to mix.  He is good.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  I got to go break.  This is a story about a man. 
[01:35:30]  He always was so lonely at night.  But his voice is rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train statement.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippi told Tommy, let's go.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's late at night and I have nowhere to go.  And the cop says to me. 
[01:36:00]  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says, and you know I have an angel.  And he says, that angel.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs. 
[01:36:30]  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain. 
[01:37:00]  That's just a little piece.  Jesus.  Wow.  How long is that?  That's really good, man.  Is that like regular song length?  No, it's just like about two minutes, just under.  If you could raise his vocals a teeny bit and make it like a perfect, that's great, dude.  That would be like perfect for a regular radio song.  So he made a real friggin' song out of it.  Lunar tape.  His ramblings.  Yeah, that was Gray Wolf just rambling about Tippi Tom and you made it into a nice song. 
[01:37:30]  Wow.  You've got a nice little voice there.  That is something.  I got a little.  Shelter me from the rain.  I like that.  I had a little feeling.  Yeah.  I was feeling it.  Me too.  I was feeling for Tippi Tom.  Yeah.  Oh, no, no.  I was actually wanting to throw water on him.  That was great, man.  And his plate.  Very good.  It's a nice little backing piece.  You can see him in a video just sitting in the gutter, you know, lying in his own piss  and shit.  Yeah.  Just singing while fucking people set fire to him and kick him.  We laugh with wow stickers. 
[01:38:00]  Shelter me.  Send that off to XM, man.  I'm sure they can play it on deep tracks or something.  Name a station, some, yeah, format they can put it on.  Name a station after it.  Homeless people with oniony bags.  Close seven.  But Eric Logan was saying to people, man, he's like, when you take away their houses  and their places to live, they become homeless.  Thank you.  Thanks, Hilo.  DHL fan from PA, what's up?  Hey, we love the Drew Boogie.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  Thank you, sir.  Get him paid.  Get him paid.  He's a genius.  I think we're supposed to pay you.  Oh, well, that's in the process.  Supposedly there's a check coming Drew Boogie's way.  Sure.  I'd do it for the love of the show.  I'm not worried about money.  Great mix, Drew.  How the hell do you make such great shit from nothing?  That's Short Bus from Redding.  Thank you, Short Bus.  And, uh, Wow, This Is Good.  Yeah.  There you go.  It was surprisingly enjoyable.  That was a real song.  I'm going to have to bring Grey Wolf back and, you know, do the whole song.  No, it's because Grey Wolf, he knows your tape, and you can't tell him because he'll try 
[01:39:00]  to, like, be good, and then he'll just stink.  He's got a great voice, though.  He's got a great radio voice.  Mike from Cleveland.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, um, I'm glad to see that there's a new Everlast song out.  He kind of fell off the map for a little while.  Hey, that's good.  Bye, Angel.  Might have to sell it to them.  Fooky, Fooky Joe.  What's up, Fook?  Hey, guys.  What's happening this morning?  Hey.  Yo.  Drew Boogie, you're a genius, man.  I've been doing production work for a couple minutes myself, and, um, I'm sorry, man. 
[01:39:30]  You are cut above the rest of the clan.  Every time you're on, I always like to make racist comments and stuff, but, uh, man, you  really, you really kicked it up a notch.  You kicked some serious ass, brother.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Cool.  Did you have to throw in the racist comments thing?  I know.  Well, the, uh, the phones are going nuts.  Everyone likes the song there, Drew.  That was awesome.  Really good song.  It just goes on and on.  You're going to have to come in and, uh, remix again for us.  Yeah, man.  Was that as long as it was?  Did he sing more or no?  No, that was it.  That was about it.  You know what you do? 
[01:40:00]  You get some, like, uh, backup singers to do a little something in the middle of the song,  get it to about three minutes, and you got something.  A little guitar solo.  Maybe you loop something, you replay a verse.  A lot of people re-sing a verse.  Am I right or wrong?  Sure.  You're right, Jimmy.  You're right.  Right you are.  You want to send clubs over to Kenny downstairs to see?  To the animals down there?  Yeah, to see what the animals are up to downstairs?  Here comes Kenny running in.  Oh, Jesus.  This is getting so old.  Did I hear my name? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, we actually, uh, we're talking about you.  Thinking about maybe sending you downstairs so you could talk to some of the, uh.  With the animals?  The animals.  They're out there in the rain.  They are dedicated.  It's raining now?  Well, it's like a little misty drizzle.  Yeah.  It sounds like I'm talking.  That's funny.  That wasn't bad.  Don't stare at me like everything's a fucking bomb.  It would have been better if you said, it feels like I'm talking.  I know.  Because if we were talking about rain, you don't hear rain on your skin. 
[01:41:00]  Whatever, you got the point.  You wrong sense referencing ass.  Are the shirts here yet, Kenny?  Not to my knowledge.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Thank you, Travis.  I was seeing, I was looking, uh, up on the website.  Yeah.  I saw the font and everything.  Was that what you had up on there, uh, Hawk?  I saw, like, a thing that, what the front and back of the t-shirts should look like.  Uh-oh.  What's wrong with it?  Uh, look. 
[01:41:30]  It, you don't actually have the word fuck on there?  Why didn't we?  It's F, like, F something something K.  What the?  No, they didn't beep out fuck on the shirt.  Who created the shirt?  Yeah, yeah, this could be, uh.  Oh, my God.  It goes against everything.  Yeah.  That's what I saw, and I panicked when I saw it.  I'm like.  What are you writing down?  Who came up with the shirt?  Oh, this goes against everything.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, look at Steve.  Steve.  No, it wasn't me.  It was.  You know, it wasn't Steve.  This filth bag.  Oh, let me see.  I think Don did it.  Why are you going?  Yeah, it's not a big secret.  We need to know who did it.  Wow, why would you bleep out fuck?  Yeah, we need the actual word.  So it's what the fuck, but the word is F, obviously, star, star, K.  Or asterisk, whatever you want to call it.  Yeah, it's, um.  Wow, just send everyone home.  I could take a Sharpie and write you and see it there. 
[01:42:30]  Wow, I don't think it would have the same impact.  You know, just tell the guys to go home.  There's nothing to see here.  Oh, my God.  We really blew another one.  See, we need the whole thing that we're here on XM, and it's, you know, we can use these  words, and that is what he said.  You think someone whispered in his ear that you can't have that with the logo on it?  Someone might have got to him.  They already decided not to, you know, put the XM logo on it. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, there is no XM logo on it.  It's Opie and Anthony on the back, and what the bleep is your problem, basically.  Man.  Dude.  X-Rated shirts dot com if you want to see what the shirts look like.  X-Rated shirts?  That's not X-Rated.  That's PG.  Not even PG.  What a PG shirts 13.  And it was from X-Rated shirts where you could print anything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it isn't the shirt company that said we don't feel we should.  It wasn't the shirt company.  Oh, boy.  That's coming from our end.  Oh, boy.  Ah.  Where?  Oh, boy. 
[01:43:30]  Who is the fuck is this?  Who is this the fuck is this?  Did you guys hear the Spanish version of that call on the replay?  Got raves.  Hilarious.  Got raves.  Oh, my God.  We should play it again.  Do we have that as an hourglass promo yet?  Yeah, it is.  We do?  Going in a break, can you play that?  Have Derek?  Derek?  Derek is on top of it.  He'll do it.  Just in case you missed it, it's hilarious.  And by the way, can I make one quick announcement that's really important?  Yes, Jimmy.  Because we're going to D.C.  This D.C. trip kind of hurts this week because I'm moving.  I am selling my TV, my couch, and chaise, which are actually very comfortable, and my table. 
[01:44:00]  In fact, they can go to Foundry and the old Jimmy Norton garage sale, DNA included.  And my TV, by the way, is a 57-inch amazing TV, not 54.  Wow, you can see the items up for bid.  And I'm not asking exorbitant amounts either.  I'm asking pretty much what they're worth.  I'm not going crazy.  That's on Foundry?  Yes.  Anthony, he's selling his coffee table.  He's selling the TV, yes. 
[01:44:30]  What else?  His comfy chair.  Oh, and his comfy chair?  I've sat in that comfy chair.  Phenomenal, man.  It's awesome.  And then your comfy couch.  They're leather.  Yeah, the black leather.  They're very comfortable.  And the bottom line is the TV is just too big for my new apartment.  Oh, my God.  We should have done it right outside the studio.  How funny would that have been?  Get a flatbed truck, have your items there, and have people kind of walking by, browsing.  Where would I find this?  Yeah, on Foundry?  Good luck.  Where would I find this?  I went to the O&A section.  Go to openanthony.com, Anthony.  Openanthony.com.  It's the first link. 
[01:45:00]  No, I want to find it on Foundry.  Well, good fucking luck.  I'm going to go down.  I told you you have to look under F for furniture.  You look under F for furniture, and then you go under first sale items.  It's not under the new furniture section.  Oh, it must be getting pounded now.  We had a 19-year-old situation.  Ramon!  Remember on the couch, that 19-year-old?  Oh, my God.  Dude, me and Voss pulled the train on that couch.  Well, it wasn't really me and Voss pretty much pulled the train. 
[01:45:30]  The prices either went up or down.  Wow.  Voss hooked the train up.  Here's what happened.  All right.  I pick up the girl.  Yeah.  The way it always happens, I'm there for support.  You pick up a 19-year-old, and your first thought is, I have to bring her to Jimmy's?  Are you insane?  No, no.  We were at the comedy cell, at a club downtown.  Comedy cellar.  And she comes to...  Wait, wait, edit.  We're at the comedy cell.  Well, we're at the comedy cell.  Thank God I stopped myself.  Let me tell you what we did, too.  So, you know, I'm giving her...  He's giving us a ride back to his house. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Or my car was at his house.  So we're in the back, fooling around, and of course...  She's driving.  Of course, he keeps his head turned around, looking at us, and very uncomfortable.  Why is he staring?  And then we get back to his house.  I go, let's go upstairs.  So I'm fooling around with her, and he pulls...  You know, he, like, forces, you know, his thing out, right?  And I finish...  My thing, grown-up?  Well, you know, his penis.  Follow what it is.  And I'm...  Hepatitis dispenser.  Next thing you know, next thing you know, she's done with me. 
[01:46:30]  And he's yanking it, and I look, and he shoots a load, and it's laying all on his head, right?  His face.  Wait, you shot a load on...  No, he shot his own load.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot the range that Jimmy has.  Any distance.  Jesus.  Lay it on his face.  And then at the end, we made her sign, like, condoms or a dog.  Dude, I just found one of those things we had.  This dumbbell thinks that that would keep us from getting rape convictions.  Right.  So he makes her sign saying she had fun.  Two days ago, I'm moving something, and a little thing that said,  you have a great dick, or I had a great time, and she ex-heard her name. 
[01:47:00]  I just found that, like, two days ago.  Well, she signs, like, a contract.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, just like one.  And they made me sign something, or they were going to do it again and again.  You jack off on her head again, and you're dead.  These guys are quick.  They pushed me out of the apartment.  They made me sign something, Henry.  You suck a juice dick in the back of a Saturn again, and you're dead. 
[01:47:30]  Wow, I forgot that happened on that couch.  Your coffee table looks like something that would be perfect to lay under  and have a girl shit on the glass table.  Like, there's almost a hammock under there.  Funny you should say that, Ant.  I guess so.  No, no, no.  My coffee table has got nothing like that happening to it.  But, I mean, for a rookie, for a novice who thinks they need the glass dignity saver,  that would be the perfect table to look up and witness something. 
[01:48:00]  And how good does a TV look with the Hornet picture on there?  Oh, oh, oh, look at that.  Was I not smart to photograph it with the Hornet picture?  With the picture.  And picture is not simulated.  No, that's an actual picture.  That's actually a photo of a Hornet special.  Big leather couches.  Yeah, it's comfy.  Wow, look at that.  HDTV.  Ant, these listeners are really fast.  I've got to go to Pell Rider.  Go ahead, Pell Rider.  Good morning, boys.  Ant, safe assumption you are not going to buy this couch.  Yeah, safe to assume I won't be purchasing the couch. 
[01:48:30]  There's no boogers on it.  Yeah.  But I can tell you, let me see, one, two, including myself, at least four comedians who have some  kind of DNA on it.  Although leather is easier to clean.  I would suppose.  I know I've wasted my time doing that.  How's the move going, Jimmy?  I'm good, actually.  I'm doing a lot of running back and forth.  I was down in Florida for my nephew's high school graduation.  I get a phone call from Jimmy.  I guess a room was just painted like a pale blue and you were losing your mind because  you thought it was the wrong color or something. 
[01:49:00]  It wasn't.  Yeah.  I think I saved that message.  It's hilarious.  I was so depressed.  You were obsessing and you needed to call one of your pals to vent, I guess, that the  color might be wrong in your bedroom.  Is blue okay?  It's not like a total baby blue.  It's actually a nice blue.  It's grown on me.  And I honestly got my friend's wife, who's really good at this stuff, I'll tell you who,  Nick DiPaolo, who his wife is like really going to knack for this type of shit.  Really?  Yeah.  It's called decorating, stupid.  Decorating.  She's great at it.  This kind of stuff. 
[01:49:30]  She's a friend.  She's helping me.  And the color she actually picked because the one I wanted was really dark and gray and  it was wrong.  He called me and goes, does light blue, will light blue match my girlfriend's crib?  He was all nervous and stuff.  That's right.  Just keep talking.  Just keep talking, stupid.  Wow.  I start off slow.  Hold on.  I should paint that joke red and yellow because it went down in flames.  The light blue will match dark bedspreads.  It's a nice color. 
[01:50:00]  Gray is too depressing and gloomy for a bedroom.  It's like Martha Stewart.  Look at this.  Dude, it's funny you should say that.  This is going to be the type of stuff you'll hear.  These are the paints from the Sherwin-Williams Martha Stewart Collection.  Is that what you're painting with?  Honest to God, that's where I'm getting my paints from, except for the one color I was  kind of fine, but for the living room.  We painted like 10 different squares in the living room.  Yeah.  And the one I thought was kind of yellowish and then my friend came over and he didn't  think that it was appropriate for my living room, so now I'm having to change it.  What friend is this that would know this type of thing? 
[01:50:30]  This is hilarious.  You've got to go with this, man.  Just a buddy.  Go ahead.  Maybe a buddy who has a certain lifestyle who's been helping me out.  Someone that's just good naturally at decorating.  And he has a lot of friends who are also male who may be good at decorating as well.  Also.  And this is a guy I spent hours with in Soho.  He was helping me couch shop.  Couch shopping.  And when I took him to my apartment and he saw the yellow, he went, oh, it would be perfect  to the hot dog.  And I said, well.  Really?  Yeah.  There's one of two reasons he was probably thinking that. 
[01:51:00]  So I decided I had got to go with another color because my gay friend didn't approve.  Didn't approve.  No.  So he told you about the blue?  But he thought the blue was fantastic.  Blue.  Yeah.  Blue.  See, it's kind of.  Yeah.  Huey.  Huey.  Huey.  Be all Huey.  Okay.  Sorry.  And he's been helping me paint.  I mean, helping me pick colors and stuff.  All right.  Anthony.  All right.  I'm on the New York radio message board.  Yeah.  And the headline says, huge plug on Opie and Anthony today. 
[01:51:30]  Because we were talking about Alan Sniffen and how he had his comments about that reporter  getting fired over our little assault on the media thing.  That's right.  If you missed it, make sure you listen to the replay today.  I've been listening to Opie and Anthony this morning and Alan's comments discussing  the fired reporter and this board have been discussed heavily and why they disagree.  Alan, hopefully you could get a copy of the audio as I'm interested in hearing your response.  And then Alan posted, this is where it gets fun for us, Anthony. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Just like old times.  Old times.  He's all happy that we're mentioning him again.  And then he says, if someone has a copy, I'll do an mp3 audio response.  Audio response.  Oh, yeah.  That's what we need.  That's what I want.  MP3 audio response coming from Alan Sniffen in the coming days.  I think Alan was trying to get a little plug.  Please, Alan, do it before we go away for the Memorial Day weekend.  Please, please, please.  It's Alan Sniffen and my audio response, I'm going to respond right now. 
[01:52:30]  Wait a minute.  I've got work to do.  Open wider.  Wider, please.  Good job.  Rinse.  Rinse.  All right.  Open.  Big.  Big.  I think what Opie and Anthony did is harm.  Give me the pick.  Pick.  Pick.  It's awful and should not.  You feel that?  Feel that?  Yeah, we forgot to tell you that he's a dentist. 
[01:53:00]  He's a dentist.  Right.  But he's an expert on New York radio.  Do we have his jingle at all?  Do we have that?  I actually like your jingle.  It's Alan Sniffen.  Why don't we have it, Eric?  You can't get that?  Every week he does an audio thing that he puts on, board reflections, and it's whatever  the message board, the New York radio message board, is talking about that week.  So he does it, and you download it, and you get to listen.  And not only is it him talking, but at the beginning, he's got a whole jingle that sounds  like the old New York WABC music radio jingle. 
[01:53:30]  With real little singers and stuff.  It's Alan Sniffen.  He's really into it.  I guess he did radio years ago.  Huh?  Danny's got it coming.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to have it.  That's funny.  Nathaniel is basking in fame, and Danny is fetching Alan Sniffen's audio.  Fetch it.  That's what I like.  Fetch quickly, boy.  I suggest Nathaniel takes the rest of the week off.  He doesn't need to be here.  I suggest we do the same.  No.  No?  We'll be here a few more days this week.  Relax, everyone.  Damn it. 
[01:54:00]  Well, what I was going to say really fast, when Anthony got the tooth thing done about  a month ago, we were supposed to get that audio on our replay machines.  You have it.  I have it somewhere?  You know what time it was when I went to the dentist, Kenny?  Oh, boy.  Here he is.  Yes, sir, I do.  What time was it?  It was the same time a Chinaman goes to the dentist.  What time?  Tooth hurty.  I thought you were going downstairs to talk to the animals.  There you get it.  Tooth hurty.  Wow.  Hint, hint. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  All right.  Just go down like...  Yeah, but we want you to wear the Darth Vader mask.  Oh.  Throw on the mask.  What do you sound like in that?  Because it actually makes your voice sound like Darth Vader.  Does it really?  Yeah.  It's got like an electronic thing.  Hawk's going to have to help him out with that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, no.  He's wearing that.  Look, he's actual size.  Wow.  That's...  You have the helmet on backwards.  It's backwards.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Wearing a poker visor.  Oh.  Say something. 
[01:55:00]  Say...  I don't sound like I'm breathing.  No.  Hawk, how does that work?  Hawk, don't worry about this.  Turn that on and make him talk like Darth Vader.  Darth Vader sounds remarkably stupid.  Now...  Now, say something that Darth Vader would say.  Say, where is the rebel base?  Where is the rebel base?  That's horrible. 
[01:55:30]  Jesus.  But how come we can still hear him?  That sounds like the Darth Kid in Tommy Lee's pool.  I'll try again.  I want to hear something interesting.  Yeah.  My wife was talking about spicing up our love life,  so I poured hot pepper seeds in her pussy.  Wow, that's pretty evil, Lord Vader.  Wow.  That is horrible.  That is...  That stinks. 
[01:56:00]  That's a great-looking mask, too.  Oh, he's so scary, the Lord of Darkness.  Look at the helmets all crooked.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny, go downstairs and interview people looking like that.  Bristling mustache poking through.  They might not, like, know who it is.  It's going to ruin my street credibility.  They'll know who it is.  Hawk, why doesn't that work?  Yeah.  What happened, Hawk?  Why does it suck?  Hawk was all excited.  He brought this in for the show today.  Is that it?  We all saw Star Wars over the weekend.  Try it now, Kenny.  Testes. 
[01:56:30]  Testing.  One, two, testes.  Do you need batteries in that like you did in your camera when Ozzy was in?  Put some batteries in there.  All right.  That's how it sounds.  All right.  Here's the problem.  Let me tell you what's going on here.  It's the worst.  The mic is also picking up his voice because he's leaning over trying to talk into the microphone.  Right.  Just mic the stupid voice box thing.  We're good.  But it doesn't have a...  And Kenny, just talk away from the mic.  There you go.  Let's try that.  Hey, Dr. Lerker.  Hey, I'm Darth Vader.  What? 
[01:57:00]  Hello.  I'm making stupid.  That is the worst.  That isn't even close to Darth Vader.  It just slowed his voice down.  Lowered the pitch.  Any other buttons that might fix it?  No?  No.  Try it again.  Where's Christmas later?  All right.  Wow.  What?  Try it with the jingle.  He's Lord Vader.  That is awful.  That stinks.  All right.  Go downstairs. 
[01:57:30]  See what's going on outside the building.  Come on, Garth.  Yes, sir.  All right.  There he goes.  Yeah.  Wear the Vader helmet.  Darth Kenny.  It's all crooked.  It's crooked.  His hair's coming out of the back.  Yeah.  We're going to take a break and we'll continue.  We'll have Francine come in and do the news next for us.  Ooh.  She's here.  Also, we are getting remixes in, Anthony.  Yeah.  Something we still haven't finished, by the way.  The psycho ex-girlfriend phone calls.  Uh-huh.  But the remixes are starting to come in.  We have one done to Raging Bull.  That's good.  That's pretty good. 
[01:58:00]  And also one done with Rich Voss' voice.  And Voss is in studio.  Ooh.  We'll get into those right after.  Richie.  Are they commercial breaks?  It's a breather.  They're breaks.  They're piss break.  They're XM promo breaks.  Are there shirts here yet?  You know, the ones you can wear around mom.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Oh.  I understand that Wiki is also having a giveaway.  We're giving away the TBS version of Scarface outside. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, really, if you're going to do something like that, you really need to spell out fuck.  You're all a bunch of motherfuckers.  Yeah.  F star star K.  That's wonderful.  I'm convinced we'll never get it right, Anthony.  We could try and try and try, but we're never going to get it right.  Never really going to land.  Never really.  Never going to stick that landing.  Right.  We always have the wobble on the landing.  The little wobble on the landing.  Like, you could see what they wanted to do.  Right.  And if it worked out perfectly, it would be beautiful, but there's always that, whoa, the 
[01:59:00]  foot goes out to the side, but they quickly bring it back in.  Bring it back in and go, hey, look.  And then put their arms up there.  No one noticed.  And everyone sits and goes, no, we saw that.  Yeah.  You screwed up a little bit.  Yeah, we screwed up.  We screwed up a little bit again.  All right.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the old name virus.  So Anthony and I came up with a cute little idea, a quick idea, that maybe we should translate 
[01:59:30]  some of our better bits into Spanish for the...  Maybe we'll get some Spanish listeners that way.  ...for the Spanish-speaking audience.  Imagine they're just tuning around the dial XM, and they hear all of a sudden some Spanish  coming out.  They go, oh, what's this?  I think XM is launching a Spanish station or a couple of them or something like that,  so maybe we could, you know, give this bit to the Spanish station on XM.  And they can play it a few times.  And so the only way this is going to make sense is to play the Bill's Dead phone call 
[02:00:00]  again.  I know it's kind of overplayed, but it is one of our favorites.  Yeah.  Basically, this old lady called one of the old stations we worked at.  Wrong number.  Wrong number, and we messed with her a little bit by telling her her dear friend Bill was  dead.  A little bit.  So we're going to play the original, and then we'll come back for a quick second, and  we'll play the Spanish version.  All right.  All right.  But first, here's the original.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is the wrong Bill. 
[02:00:30]  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Bill died today.  Yeah, kid.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  It's John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Where did this happen?  Uh, this afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God.  Love him.  Yeah.  Yeah, big, big, big pile-up.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences. 
[02:01:30]  Okay.  Well, I gotta go.  All right, John.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  So, there's the original Bill's Dead call.  Uh-huh.  Now, uh, here's that same bit in Spanish.  Hey, it's making us chuckle today.  Listen for Who Is Is This?  Listen for our awful Spanish.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Bill's Dead in Spanish.  Hello.  Hello. 
[02:02:00]  Hello.  Guillermo.  Who is this?  Patricio.  Patricio, how are you?  I'm not talking about what I call him.  I'm equivocating.  Uh, well, Patricio, I have bad news.  Yes.  Uh, Guillermo is dying today.  I'm crying.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Si.  Que tragedia. 
[02:02:30]  Quien es esto?  El estuvo en un accidente de cuddle.  I know.  Quien es esto?  Esto es Juan.  Juan?  Si.  Perfect, Marie.  Dios mio.  Yo no look real.  Si.  Quien es lo que yo estaba hablando con Ã©l no hace mucho. 
[02:03:00]  Yo sÃ©.  Cuando quiso esto?  Esta tarde.  Â¿A dÃ³nde?  En la carretera.  Ay, que Dios lo quiera.  Si.  Si.  Grande.  Grande.  Ok.  Pues es lo que la de a los hijos del paciente. 
[02:03:30]  Pues.  Me tengo que ir.  Esta bien, Juan.  Esta bien.  Gracias.  Hasta luego.  Hasta luego.  There you have to.  Maybe that's a laugh for the last day.  Of course.  The last day.  So stupid.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:04:00]  The virus is spreading.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  Now, no way.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  Now, no way.  Ah, Rich Boston studio today.  Drew Boogie hanging out on the lesbian couch right now.  We got Ziggy here. 
[02:04:30]  What's up, Zig?  I always forget his website.  We'd love to plug his website.  What is him?  He does a lot of great stuff for the Opie and Anthony program and XM in general.  Ziggy, what's your website?  It's myradiostore.com and xm411.com.  There you go.  He does some great, great stuff.  Also, Francine is wandering around.  Club Soda Kennedy might go outside to see if the animals are starting to gather.  Darth Boar to get there.  Basically, the new Sith. 
[02:05:00]  You are Darth Boar.  Darth Boar.  Basically, we're going to be handing out these G-rated shirts that say,  What the F is your problem, man?  F.  The F word.  F, star, star, K.  Well, my original idea was, What the fudge is your problem?  Because I think that's kind of the ledger.  Easy.  Calm down, though.  Well, that could offend people.  They just think of the word fudge as the F word. 
[02:05:30]  Good point, Ed.  Francine is making her way into the studio.  But first, we've got some Psycho X Girlfriend remixes to get to.  These are starting to slowly but surely make their way into the show.  Didn't we play one already?  What was that one?  Will you play one already, Eric?  I played the Jimmy Call with the Psycho X Girlfriend.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Was it funny?  You want to play that again?  I don't remember that one.  I don't remember.  What did it stink?  This was the first one that came in.  Didn't it just miss?  Was this the one that just missed?  Yeah, I think so.  It's not that long.  Angel! 
[02:06:00]  Hi, sweetie.  What the fuck are you doing?  Aw, don't get all angry and yell.  Did you really want it to be over?  Is that what you want?  Mm-hmm.  I don't understand how you could be so mean.  I'm paranoid and I have issues.  You know what?  Have fun with your fucking stubbornness because I can't deal with it.  Stop with the semantics.  I've given you everything.  Say what you want to say.  I'm done doing this thing with you, chasing you, until the part where you'd exhaust me. 
[02:06:30]  Okay.  All I can say is, if you're out at a fucking bar, when I went to your house, drove by you, you saw me, and you just drove by me.  That's not the way it happened.  That's dishonest.  It's not the way it happened.  It's not the way it happened.  So are you happy?  Are you happy?  No, I'm not.  What, do you think?  The world is going to fucking chase you because you're Mr. Wonderful?  That is so sociopathic, I almost don't know how to respond to it.  Whatever.  I hate you. 
[02:07:00]  Because you know what?  You've tortured me.  You've made me feel like shit.  Actually, you might be right.  You know what?  You go live your life, all right?  I'll be fine, and I'm out of here.  Okay?  Whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Bye.  That's right.  It just missed.  That was a decent one.  Yeah, that wasn't bad.  That's not bad.  The second one.  It just misses, though.  Yeah, it just misses. 
[02:07:30]  Just slightly because of the editing.  Well, we got a couple new ones in.  We'll start with the Rich Voss one because Voss is in studio here.  Psycho X Girlfriend Remixes.  Oh, give it a little tap.  Oh, there you are.  Here we go.  Hey, what's going on?  If you're at a fucking bar right now, I will never, ever forgive you.  Ever.  But yet, you've got to track me down.  You're like an ex-girlfriend.  You know what?  I don't know what is up your ass tonight. 
[02:08:00]  Someone's fixed in my teeth.  Whatever.  You better, like, wake up to reality.  Can we tie this in so I don't have to talk through my phone?  You want this to be over?  Well, it'll be over pretty quickly.  Because you know what?  This is fucking bullshit.  I hate to tell you, you're wrong again.  Yeah, you really want to be with me.  Thanks for showing me.  Let me tell you something.  You can say I slobber, I screw up words, and I'm stupid. 
[02:08:30]  All right?  I'll go with those.  But when it comes to loyalty, rich boss is number one.  You know what?  You're a fucking bastard.  What's that?  Talk to you.  Oh, yeah, she has nothing.  You are a fucking asshole.  And I'm stupid.  And you really want it to be over?  Is that what you want?  No, I'm not doing it.  Here, talk, talk.  I'll talk to everyone.  What time is it?  But it's 11.22.  You told me 11 o'clock, you fucking cunt.  I am done.  I am. 
[02:09:00]  You're a fucking cunt.  You're a fucking unappreciative fuckhead.  So I hope you're happy.  I hope you're happy being a lonely guy.  You better fucking believe it.  Don't waste my fucking time again.  Hey, that's pretty clever.  Those were great.  That came out of nowhere.  Do you notice how the tone is similar through the calls?  He did something which was just perfect for the tone.  Yeah, they're getting a little better.  That one was all right.  I forgot about that guy yelling and screaming at his son. 
[02:09:30]  That's how dumb I am.  I thought these were actual phone calls.  And when Jimmy came on, I'm going,  But it can't be.  He doesn't have a girlfriend.  And then I just realized they remix his stuff.  Oh, boy.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Ask Assa.  Jesus.  Jesus, boss.  My God.  Well, I didn't know the bit because I don't have XM,  so I didn't know if he's going to. 
[02:10:00]  Well, how do you not have XM with your friends?  Because they're supposed to get me.  How do you, Rich?  He was supposed to get XM.  Two months ago.  How do you not have XM?  He doesn't have XM.  No, you're not.  Look at it.  Look at it.  How do you not have XM?  Jesus.  What the hell has got you all worked up?  A Cialis.  Jesus.  Jimmy, what's wrong with you?  He hears your girl yelling on the phone,  and he gets a hard-on.  Gee, man.  Well, it's not a full.  Well, you've got a Cialis hard-on boy. 
[02:10:30]  I've got a Cialis hard-on.  He's kind of laying there.  Just knocking everybody.  All right, well.  Looks like Ben after he gets out of a cold shower.  Ben's back to work today.  Yes, he is.  Ben has made a return.  Did we ever get an explanation?  Not really.  None?  Not really.  Yeah, we did.  Remember through the door?  I was like, oh, okay.  That's what I thought.  I would love an explanation.  Well, I think you should demand one.  You're the boss?  Yeah.  For Pete's sake.  All right, well, we have another remix here.  This is the Raging Bull one. 
[02:11:00]  Ooh.  You went out for drinks tonight.  You don't call me back.  You don't return my messages.  You don't believe me.  You thought I was over there fooling around.  Huh?  You thought I was fooling around, didn't you?  Tell me the truth.  I ain't going to fool around.  That's in your mind.  Since I'm probably going to be moving back,  I'm not going to be needing the cell phone.  Part of my deal in signing it was learning how to use it.  Bring it over.  Which was what was promised to me by their trusty account executive. 
[02:11:30]  Bring it over.  Which I didn't get.  Bring it over.  And you know what?  I don't care if they think I'm fucking crazy,  but I don't even have a copy of the contract.  Bring it over here.  And you know where?  What if I got back?  And you don't, I don't want you to hurt her.  I'm going to eat it for lunch.  You hear what I'm saying?  You hurt me emotionally more than anyone has ever done.  Who are we arguing about?  I just don't feel the need to tell you that you are just a worthless fucking piece of crap.  You hear what I said?  You don't ever have any disrespect for me.  You hear what I said?  You hear what I said? 
[02:12:00]  And you fucking tortured me.  You fucking tortured me.  You're a fucking Jesus fit.  Shut up.  I'm going to smack you in the face.  Fuck you.  I swear to God, I'm going to come in there and I'm going to kill you.  You care so little.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck your mother.  It's kind of just funny.  It's not bad.  Listen to the clips.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  Is anybody else noticing how just amazing that music is?  Ah, it's very soothing.  Alright, there you have it.  The latest, uh...  Bring it in here.  Psycho Ex-Girlfriend remix.  Get over.  Yeah, bring it over.  I'd like to give the guys credit.  The listeners can't just be handing this stuff in without getting credit.  I gotta give them a lot of credit there, Mikey.  We gotta give these guys credit for, uh, working hard for the show.  First time, long time.  Fuck you, a mother.  Oh, my boy. 
[02:13:00]  Ugh.  Speech lip.  Alright, let's go downstairs and talk to Club Soda.  Kenny.  He's big and he's, uh, stupid.  Kenny!  Yeah!  What's up, Kenny?  You should see this hot chick that's getting on the bus.  She looks like good eats.  She looks like good eats.  Yeah.  Alright, what's going on out there?  I'm out here with the usual suspects.  They're out here in the rain waiting for the thing. 
[02:13:30]  Right.  Those, uh...  They're all in good spirits and they can't wait for the big moment.  Alright, well, we're waiting for the FedEx guy to show up with the t-shirts, so...  I know.  I know.  They're waiting, too.  But, you know, all the all-stars are down here.  That, uh...  Pat from Monaki.  Right.  The, uh...  The Nubian Brother.  That, uh...  One Sherry Darch for the Wi-Fi.  And, uh...  You know, a few other... 
[02:14:00]  You know, a lot of other people.  Alright, let's talk to, uh...  Pat from Monaki.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Pat from Monaki.  Would you like to talk?  Why, surely.  And don't call me Shirley.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Pat.  It's getting close to having a second CD ready, huh?  Yeah.  Another appearance for Pat from Monaki.  What's up, Pat?  Hey.  Hey.  Don't you have things to deliver, Pat?  What's that?  Don't you have things to deliver? 
[02:14:30]  Uh, yeah.  As a matter of fact, the van's all loaded up, uh...  Waiting to get delivered.  So people are waiting for their stuff because you have to sit out there and wait for a shirt  that will never fit you?  Yeah.  Well, guys gotta have priorities, you know?  Huh.  Huh.  Huh.  Huh.  Oh.  Hey, you guys gonna set up a big meeting down in Washington with, uh...  Elo and Patlo?  Pat Mo?  Oh, he ruined his bad line. 
[02:15:00]  It was supposed to be Pat Mo, Pat from Monaki, and he said Pat Lowe.  That's not even a car crash.  That's just a run out of gas sputter.  Oh.  Into a ditch.  Oh.  So how is Lunaki?  Ugh.  All right, Pat.  I don't know if you have anything today.  What's that?  Do you have anything else today?  Uh, no, not really.  This is a guy that drove five hours down there.  Do you like to speak back to Kenny?  Out with a whimper. 
[02:15:30]  Uh, yeah.  He can't even bomb.  Pat's not even up to bombing.  No.  All right, let's get Kenny back on the phone here.  Hello?  Hey, Kenny.  Did that big dog tell you about his hot dog eating contest now?  Um, he's in the Coney Island hot dog eating contest, right?  Yeah, and he's got a new CD he's ready to drop.  He's got another CD that's gonna drop.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, here's Patty.  Patty, Patty.  You hear the chant?  Yeah, they're doing that. 
[02:16:00]  That's what they call me.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, let's get Stalker Patty on the air.  Here, Patty.  Hello?  Hi, Stalker Patty.  How are you?  Oh, I'm fine.  I just got here from work.  I don't have to come back till 11, so I'm in good shape.  I hope you brought some chocolate.  Not today, but...  Oh, why do you bother coming down here?  Yeah, then you stay in the rain with the rest of the freaks.  Oh.  Oh, I'm sorry, Opie.  You're gonna get a nice treat next week. 
[02:16:30]  I'm gonna...  Okay.  Exactly.  Oh, look at that.  Ooh.  Exactly.  Can't wait.  It's between two cheeks and it tastes like mushroom.  Lucky you, Opie.  You too.  I was upset to come up tomorrow, but you're going to Washington, so I'll come up next week.  Better late than ever.  Better late than never.  Yeah.  Right.  All right, Patty.  I can't wait for your latest gift.  Sure.  No problem.  Sure. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, Patty.  All right.  Let me give you back...  Patty.  Patty.  What?  Patty.  Yes?  Patty.  Yeah?  Patty, where are you?  She hung up.  Patty.  I'm here.  Why'd she hang up?  I don't know.  They said I hung up, but I really didn't.  Oh, you're too good for us!  They're playing the silent game.  The silent game.  Yeah, you're just too smart, Patty.  The new Patty's just way too smart.  Yeah, what can I say?  I grew a brain. 
[02:17:30]  Well, when you grow a funny bone, call back in.  Fucking witless mox.  Oh, that's in the budding stages right now.  Oh, stop it.  All right.  Well, 50-year-old virgin.  Thank you, Patty.  Yeah, I'll be 50 in a week from Saturday.  Yeah, you have a hymen like a trampoline.  Why don't you have some sex?  All right, let me give you back to the gentleman, okay?  All right.  The gentleman.  There are none of those down there.  Not a one. 
[02:18:00]  Okay, hold on.  All right.  Hello?  All right, Kenny.  Thank you so much.  Well, I got to clean the phone.  Yeah, I understand.  I understand.  Anybody else you want to talk to?  Nah.  Hey, put Pete on the phone.  Pete?  Yeah, the guy with the Slayer shirt.  Hey, Pete!  Pete!  Pete, no one wants to talk to you. 
[02:18:30]  Well, we're waiting, Kenny.  There's no Pete.  There is.  The guy with the Slayer shirt, dude.  He's right there.  I saw him when I came in.  Hey, Francine.  Step up to the microphone before you fall asleep.  We have Francine in studio.  For the new listeners, we got a treat for you today.  Francine.  Hi, Francine.  In studio.  Hey, guys.  Well, we need some news on the program. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  By the way, when we're in Washington, we're going to have Dee Dee doing the news tomorrow  and Thursday, I guess.  Patty didn't bring any, but at least we have some sweet chocolate here in the studio today.  I'll say we do.  I spent all night working on this.  You did?  Yeah.  Wait, you spent all night working on your news?  I swear I didn't sleep.  Do you understand that?  Oh, my God.  We work with just a bunch of dummies.  We really do. 
[02:19:30]  It's supposed to be current events?  It's supposed to be a, yeah, the news for today.  Like news.  You don't see the guys that do the 6 o'clock broadcast on the news having done the news  the night before.  Working real hard on the news the night before.  So they can sleep, wake up, and read about stuff that happened the day before.  You want to be updated with the news.  That's why you do.  The name news really means new.  It's things.  It's new.  It's all the news.  That's right.  New stuff. 
[02:20:00]  You're doing the olds.  Yeah.  This is the olds broadcast.  You know, there are people out there that just, they're just not familiar with the program  yet, and they're convinced we write this material.  They're just convinced that we write this shit.  Yeah.  News.  New.  New.  It never hit me.  New.  Oh, Jesus.  Are you shitting me, Vaughn?  I'm totally right.  Never even put that together.  New.  Me neither, actually.  News.  News.  There are some urban myths that it actually stands for the four points of the compass.  North, east, west, south. 
[02:20:30]  What is covering the entire world.  But it actually is just from new news.  Forget Aristotle.  They fucked Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  He always amazes, doesn't he, guys?  He sure does.  Knows a little something about everything.  And we're all too dumb to know if he's right or wrong, so we just nod.  Exactly.  He does not go up.  Of course that's what it is.  My biggest strength.  It's new with an S.  I like that.  It's not that he's smart.  It's that we're retarded.  The whole north, east, west, and south thing. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  What about local news?  Would that just be local, north, east, west, and south?  Well, calling it news was probably long before they got local and satellite forecast.  It was probably just new.  Some guy running from township to township with a piece of paper.  It's just that.  To north, east, west, south.  It's just that it was new information and they just called it news.  What's new?  What's new today?  Well, we're going to get to yesterday's news with Francine, I guess, because she worked all night.  All night.  Pulled an all-nighter to get the news report.  Oh, yes. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  You ready?  Wait, what's wrong with your eyes?  What's wrong with your eyes, Angel?  I said, like, last time it took me a week to write the last one.  Yeah.  See?  This one took me one night.  A week to write the news.  Wow.  News.  Got Elo and the gang of Washington just rolling their eyes going, we really want a news person  on your program.  That's right.  Not these dopes.  Now, Francine, I guess we can play some music for her.  Or a news bed or something.  Yeah, all right.  Something that's news-like.  The typewriter would be good. 
[02:22:00]  All right.  Typewriter.  Not a teletype machine, but typewriter.  Isn't that what it is?  No, you don't hear a ding, do you?  At my house.  Yeah, it was.  That was an old typewriter.  That's funny.  Mickey Spillane.  Yeah, I like that one.  Good.  Last thing that was typed on that was dodging and it was misspelled.  D-O-G-G-I-N-G.  Fogging her.  Later.  All right.  Let's hit the news bed and we'll have Francine do the news for us today.  All right. 
[02:22:30]  Thank you.  All right.  Well, today I'm going to do movie reviews.  Oh, my God.  Derek is applauding at Eric.  Oh, Derek is applauding at Eric.  You've got to see what happens around here.  Screwing up.  Everyone, all the underlings.  There is such competition going on.  Oh, there it is.  There ain't timing.  Now we're trying to...  Shut up.  They are roaring in there.  They are roaring.  Look, Eric.  Look over there.  That's right.  Look.  Look over in the studio.  They're laughing at you.  Look over at Derek.  Eric, come on. 
[02:23:00]  Look at him.  That's right.  Just look at him.  Come on, Derek and Eric.  Just move your eyes for a second.  Look at him laughing.  That's right, Hawk.  Take your beating.  That's right.  Oh, the second that sound clip didn't come up, Derek just starts laughing at him.  Howling and howling and howling and howling.  There's a whole hierarchy thing that's happened.  They're all jockeying for position.  They were pointing at him, clapping and laughing at him like he's a monkey in a cage.  What happened there, Eric?  What happened?  Yeah, Eric.  What happened?  It just wasn't playing. 
[02:23:30]  Right.  It just wasn't playing.  All right.  See what?  No one can see.  It's radio.  What are you doing?  We just hear.  And we hear there's no bed.  And then we hear the bed come over and talking.  That's right.  While Ant's trying to explain something.  Then the bed pops up.  All right.  Let's.  All right.  I'm sure it'll work now.  Yeah.  Let's play the news teletype thing.  And Francine's going to do yesterday's news for today.  Yeah, we are.  And now the news with Francine.  Francine.  Okay.  Well, I'm going to.  Wait a minute.  What happened there?  It's not doing anything.  Stop right clicking, you shithead. 
[02:24:00]  You're not trying to save target as.  Oh, my God.  Are they laughing?  Oh, you're going to kill them in there.  They can't even do their.  They can't even do their jobs in the other room because they're too busy laughing at you now.  What happened?  Derek, will you please play the clip for us?  We have some.  There.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is.  Works for Derek.  Works for Derek.  Wait, Steve.  What's the problem?  Yeah, Steve.  You have to get the teletype bed.  Now, he's got them in two channels.  And the one channel he keeps hitting doesn't come up on this board. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, but what do you mean?  Why is he not hitting the right channel?  I don't know, Jimmy.  The fact.  Oh.  Jesus.  Steve, my windscreen went under the thing.  Uh-oh.  Pick up his windscreen, for Christ's sake.  Steve, you're breaking the mic now.  It's under Francine's legs.  I don't know what happened.  Pick up that big black thing.  That's right.  Wow.  There you go.  You just entertained that room.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's have Derek play the teletype, Anthony.  Thanks, Derek.  Derek, if you will, why don't you play it? 
[02:25:00]  Thank you.  Good boy.  And now, Francine with the news.  Francine.  Okay.  I went to the movies, so I'm going to do some movie reviews for you guys.  That's always how they start off the news.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Isn't that the last thing they do?  Although, when Star Wars broke, they did.  You know, that was the lead story.  It wasn't quite a review, but it was...  All right.  All right.  Let's go.  Movie reviews with Francine.  There's a volcano right now erupting in Mexico, but let's hear the movie reviews. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  Nice.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Let's hear your Caddyshack review.  Go ahead, Angle.  Okay.  I'd like to send a big fuck you to the faggots who advertised that movie, Layered Cake, comparing  it to such kick-ass flicks as Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smokin' Barrels.  It was terribly confusing and awfully gay, gay, gay.  How many shots can you show of Daniel Craig?  The whole movie is just filled with body shots and close-ups of Daniel Craig's face and body. 
[02:26:00]  You should change the title of the movie to A Midsummer's Faggot's Dream.  Terrible, terrible.  Also, The Interpreter, the last...  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  That's a long title, Francine.  All right.  Slow down.  Yes, Voss?  Well, I mean, Snatch and the other one, Lock, Stock, aren't really classics.  They're not up there with...  Snatch was a great movie.  I love that movie.  Snatch gets better and better, especially the dialogue.  She completely lost me.  I know.  Well, that's the beauty of Francine.  I have no idea what movie she's talking about.  Yeah, what's the name of the movie?  It's called Layered Cake. 
[02:26:30]  It's from the same...  Does anyone know what Layered Cake's about?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Give me a synopsis, Eric, of Layered Cake, please.  I didn't even know there was a movie out called Layered Cake.  Layered Cake?  Well, I'm a big Snatch and Lock, Stock fan, and it's the same producer.  You're a big fan of Snatch, are you?  Yeah.  And Lock, Stock and Two Smokin' Barrels.  They were great movies.  So, when they said the producer came out with a new one, I came...  Yeah, but the producer doesn't mean shit.  Well, I thought it would be the same kind of movie. 
[02:27:00]  The producer's just a guy that goes, here's a bunch of money, make me a good film, and  I'll kind of take a peek every once in a while.  They're not an involved...  It's called Layered Cake.  Layered Cake.  Layered Cake.  All right, Anthony.  It's called what?  It's called Layered Cake.  Layered what, E-R?  L-A-Y-E-R.  That's how you spell Layered Cake.  Layered Cake.  Do you have a synopsis, Anthony, or...?  Let's see.  A successful cocaine dealer planning an early retirement is lured back into the business  by a love interest and an international drug ring. 
[02:27:30]  Yep, that's it.  That explains it?  Mm-hmm.  And it has Daniel Craig in it.  Yep.  Who you might remember from...  Yes, Ant?  Looking.  Exactly.  He was in that film...  The Daniel Craig story.  Yeah, and then there was that other thing he did when he...  He...  Yeah.  Wow, I am really looking, and... 
[02:28:00]  Well, according to RottenTomatoes.com, Anthony, I love RottenTomatoes.com, because they take  all the reviews from America, from all the papers, and then they throw it all together.  Wait, go up first of all.  Ah, they give it a fresh rating, Anthony.  That means, well, in this case, 79% of all the movie reviews across America actually liked  this film.  Liked it.  Liked it a lot.  It's hard to remember an American gangster film that has been as brazenly entertaining  as Layer Cake.  Layer Cake is a fabulous movie about the underworld we only want to visit on Facebook. 
[02:28:30]  A must for those who like their tough talk delivered with an English accent.  A stylishly dark, occasionally funny UK gangster film in the tradition of John McKenzie's The  Long Good Friday and Peter Medak's The Craze.  It goes on and on.  The film's style makes up for its difficult story.  I guess you have to have a brain to watch the movie, Francine.  Well, I watched it, and I tried to figure it out by myself, and it wasn't good. 
[02:29:00]  Why is the main character's name, like, XXXX?  They didn't give his name until, well, they never did.  They never gave his name?  Yeah.  Here's, this could be the problem for you, Francine.  This review from, I guess, a site called Three Movie Buffs.  Fast-paced and complex, Layer Cake rewards those who pay attention.  Ooh.  We know you've had a problem with that in the past.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Ooh.  It just goes on and on.  Most movie reviewers love the movie. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Well, I didn't like it.  Well, she didn't like it, Anthony.  Yeah, it was really terrible.  You should start with a movie like Donut.  Really?  And then work your way up.  What's that about?  Layer Cake is very complex.  Yeah, Donut was a great movie.  You never heard, you never saw Donut?  Nothing like Pop-Tart.  Nothing.  Ugh.  Even tried throwing another pastry in him.  I didn't even know what you were doing.  How many, how many frosted treats will he toss in before he gets to that wall?  Munchkin?  Thriller. 
[02:30:00]  Dang.  Oh.  God.  Zeppelin.  Did you see Zeppelin?  Ah, shit.  Well, Kelly, don't have a slower pace.  That would be a mess.  I liked it.  Uh-oh.  Something's here.  Oh, oh, oh.  You're seeing boxes of maybe shirts?  I certainly am, and a really good-looking UPS man.  Are those the shirts?  Those aren't the shirts?  You know damn well the shirts aren't going to arrive today.  What is it?  I already figured that out.  What is it?  Something else.  What is it, Eric?  What is it, Eric?  Travel cases for the insertion. 
[02:30:30]  Ooh, travel cases.  Oh, great.  Very nice.  All right.  So, let's get back to Francine.  You didn't like Layer Cake, because it was a what?  Well, I went to see it, and I sat down, and I tried to figure it out.  And I just couldn't figure it out.  There was too many, like, things going on, and they weren't really connecting the story  properly.  She's right.  Because of her, I now want to see the movie.  Yeah, it's got to be good.  It has to be good.  But I figured out Snatch and Lockstock, and they didn't even go in order.  All right. 
[02:31:00]  Why would it go in order?  Well, it was kind of like, you know how that guy who does other films, that Pulp Fiction  stuff, you know how it doesn't go in order?  Quentin Tarantino?  Yeah.  Yeah, the film is all over the place, and it kind of gets tied up at the end.  I figured those movies out.  You figured out Pulp Fiction?  Yeah.  It went backwards.  Well, in some spots, yeah.  What was Pulp Fiction about?  Drugs and killing and hamburgers.  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:31:30]  She really whittles it down to the most common denominator, doesn't she?  Well, there's a lot of breathing and people talking and communicating.  But she figured it out, Anthony.  Yeah.  Sure.  Yep.  And killing.  And killing.  It was very good.  Someone taped Fox News.  They're doing all-time faves.  It looks like all-time favorite villains or something like that.  That could be very interesting.  In the movies?  I think so.  Because a lot of people are saying Darth Vader, the best villain ever. 
[02:32:00]  Maybe, yeah.  I think Gene Hackman in Batman.  Maybe I should have thrown pastry in with it.  Don't try to make yourself look better by picking out on my abomination.  Hold on.  I'd like to know who Gene Hackman played in Batman.  Yeah.  He played...  You don't remember?  Oh, Superman.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  No. 
[02:32:30]  Hold on.  And to answer your question, 47-year-old man, no, I don't remember.  You remember?  No, I don't.  Child speak.  Oh, is that when Batman came in and he said, hey there, Mr. Luthor, you're in the wrong  movie.  You're supposed to be paralyzed.  Lex Luthor.  I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.  Wow.  All right.  How'd you like Christopher Walken in Cuckoo's Nest?  He was fantastic, wasn't he? 
[02:33:00]  Ah!  You know, throw the sink through the window.  All right, well.  Wow.  Where'd it go from there?  Back to Francine, I guess, who figured out Pulp Fiction because it's about killing drugs  and hamburgers.  And hamburgers.  And guns.  And guns.  All right.  Well, let's move on with the news, I guess.  Big Kahuna Burger.  Yeah.  That Hawaiian joint.  Frank Whaley, by the way, that was.  He used to come in a Boston Comedy Club, and the boss was mean to him.  I wasn't mean to him.  You were a dick to him. 
[02:33:30]  Yes, you were.  He was a nice guy trying a little stand-up for a movie.  Really?  I was on stage or something.  He was also in some gangster movie.  He was in a movie called Swimming with the Sharks with Kevin Spacey.  Yeah, I saw that.  Great actor, Frank Whaley, and that was him having a big Kahuna Burger.  Say what again?  You're busting his balls like you always do.  And I was nice to him.  I didn't even know he was back then.  We didn't know he was.  Okay.  Francine, with the news.  Back to the telepike.  Okay.  Congratulations to Eva Longaneria.  All right, hold on, hold on. 
[02:34:00]  What happened to the rest of the movie reviews?  Oh, I could continue, too.  Yeah, of course.  I hope you have something on Star Wars.  It made all sorts of money.  Yeah, I do.  I do a little piece.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Also a terrible fucking movie, The Interpreter.  The last time I ever see a movie starring Nicole Kidman was garbage.  So, basically, I hated these two movies.  They were total douchebag flicks.  Zero action, made no sense, no thumbs down, better off staying home, watching porn, and jerking off. 
[02:34:30]  Wow.  That's something you don't get when you watch Eppert and Roper.  No.  Yeah.  Nope.  Or Roper and Eppert.  Or a live one and the other one who doesn't have mush in his head.  Oh, man.  It was so much easier when it was skull and Eppert.  The long pudding skull.  What is it now?  Eppert and Roper?  I don't know.  Old rice pudding brains.  He sneezed. 
[02:35:00]  He just...  Old sloshing around in there.  Shaking up and it snows in that little town.  It's just brain matter.  That's because you should put a little Santa Claus scene on his brain stem.  All right.  Well, what do you got on Star Wars there?  Well, it's going to come up next.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  We've got to say congratulations to Eva Longoria and her Desperate Housewives counterparts  and their success this weekend.  Approximately 30 million viewers tuned in to watch their season finale. 
[02:35:30]  I wasn't one of them, and I don't know one other person that was either.  Me neither, but I read it.  So you copied it?  No.  Listen to how she read it.  She never disappoints.  Go ahead.  Thank you.  Longoria, who is skanking it up, has been linked to just about every dick in Hollywood,  including boy bander J.C. Chavez, basketball...  Hold on. 
[02:36:00]  Wow.  That's the way to go to court.  Just like Phil Spector did.  You know, I'm sure you got it in your local paper.  The Phil Spector do that he's wearing in court is beyond hilarious.  You know, he's going to grab his head and go, and make a wish.  He looks like a Dr. Seuss character.  He really is.  Horton hears a sexual abuse and a murder.  You've got to love Fox News.  They just did a split screen of how he used to look all relatively normal with his hair  slicked back in his sunglasses, and then look at, like, I don't know, what did he look  like? 
[02:36:30]  Just with a massive afro.  I won't kill here.  I won't kill there.  Oh, my God.  Sorry about that.  What are you doing?  What are you doing, boss?  We're just smoking in the middle of the show.  Stop coughing.  Oh, he's going to go out for a cigarette, and then he's coughing.  Yeah, don't, you're not going anywhere for a cigarette.  But you're relaxing.  Are you jonesing that bad?  When are you going to quit smoking?  Really, I'm going to go back to this news.  All right, go ahead, Francine, pick up where you left off, if you could.  Right there.  Okay.  No, no, down. 
[02:37:00]  Someone wants to know if we can go back to the big Kev audio from the Star Wars premiere.  That was great.  Kev has some pretty funny questions.  I listened to the radio.  Shut up.  What did he say to one guy?  Shut up.  He said, hey.  All right, Francine, go ahead.  Okay, she's been linked to J.C. Chavez, basketball player Tony Parker, actors Butch  Klein, Sean Ferris, and now Hayden Christensen, who plays Doris Vader in the new Star Wars  Episode III, Revenge of the Sith, which has raked in approximately $158 million this weekend. 
[02:37:30]  Number one movie.  She's all happy.  That's a paycheck for me, Robin.  Should it continue?  That's all you have on Star Wars?  One of the biggest movie releases in recent memory?  Did you see it?  No, I didn't go see it.  Yeah, I'm going to go see it.  But not yet.  Not yet.  What?  Did you see the first two?  I saw the very first one with, uh...  Oh, boy.  This could be a problem.  Harrison Ford. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, all right.  You haven't seen any since then?  No.  Wait, I might have seen it on TV, but I don't remember.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's it about?  Star Wars?  Yeah.  It's about the stars and spaceships and fighting in the sky and a guy in a cape who carries  a big sword.  It's a lifesaver, right.  Yeah.  It's kind of like a sword.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Off by 40 centuries.  And they're in the future and they do lots of fighting. 
[02:38:30]  Mm-hmm.  Very good.  No hamburgers?  When are you going to turn ten?  Is this the third or fourth Star Wars?  I think it's the sixth one, isn't it?  Of course it is.  Thank you, Francis.  Jesus, Francis.  Of course it is.  The force is way off.  This is Battle of the Dummies.  It's happening right in front of us right now.  How many?  How many Star Wars?  Number six.  Six.  Didn't they call it the third or something?  No, nobody answered them.  Nobody acknowledged your heard words.  Just let it sit there. 
[02:39:00]  I didn't see any of them.  47 years old.  You never saw the first Star Wars?  I never saw any Star Wars.  Don't you remember when it came out?  Don't you remember?  Isn't this called, what's this called?  What's the name of this one?  Star Wars what?  The Revenge of the Sith.  Sith.  The Revenge of the Sith.  Darth Vader has a lump on his balls.  So the back of my ear is in the movie.  The Revenge of the Sith.  There goes the Photoshop.  Everyone at Wackbag's like, thank you.  Thank you.  Go to Wackbag.com in the Photoshop segment, or section I should say, and prepare to see 
[02:39:30]  some Revenge of the Sith.  Revenge of the Sith.  Brilliant.  All right.  So Star Wars is a movie about stars, Anthony.  And fighting.  And fighting.  And swords.  And swords.  Cool.  All right.  What was JFK about?  A wig and a car ride.  The airport.  It was about the parking situation.  David Ferry's riding around.  You just, where are you going to plug? 
[02:40:00]  It's an enigma trapped in the middle.  You a handsome parking attendant, Mr. Gasson.  And a big ta-ta.  All right.  Well, okay.  All right.  Revenge of the Sith.  And what else you got there?  Former diva Mariah Scary turned psycho bitch from hell is back on the Billboard charts once  again with her new album titled The Re-Mancipation of Mimi. 
[02:40:30]  Scary, who should have committed suicide way back in the early 90s, is trying to change her  skanky image.  But although talented, every year she seems to be turning into an even more and more self-absorbed  psychotic cunt.  Case in point, Mariah went on record in Essence Magazine claiming to be America's most misunderstood  black woman.  What are you talking about, Mariah?  That is such bullshit.  You are not black and you are not white. 
[02:41:00]  You're just fucking crazy.  Wow.  A little editorializing there.  Yeah, I like that.  You can only hear that on the news that often.  I mean, one time I heard Dan Rather refer to someone as a hosebag, but he never actually  went with the full C word.  Not any real potty mouth.  Except for that Arthur Chang guy.  Yeah.  Whatever his name is.  What the fuck is your problem, Mariah?  Cunt.  Jesus, Francine.  She's all proud of herself.  Thank you, guys.  You're doing a really good job today.  I've got to tell you. 
[02:41:30]  Thank you.  I try.  All right.  What else you got?  More?  Our hearts and prayers go out to the young girl who was assaulted by a horrible monster  of a man.  Oh!  Go ahead.  Hector Ramirez, who dragged this unnamed girl out of her room in an understaffed Bellevue  hospital, took her to an empty conference room, molested, and raped her. 
[02:42:00]  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  With surveillance cameras and two eyewitnesses, how did you expect to get away with this?  Well, I'll tell you.  That's an attention getter.  I'll tell you how you can get away with child abduction and molestation.  Mr. Ramirez, first, you get a time machine.  Go back 46 years and come back as a young black boy. 
[02:42:30]  Next, become a famous pop star.  Fast forward 25 years later, slowly but surely, turn yourself white and start obsessing about  Peter Pan.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Build a giant amusement park filled with candy and carousel and kiddie rides and proclaim  yourself killing a pop.  You get my point.  You don't have enough money or fame to get away with this crime.  Ramirez, you are fucked.  That's a lot of time travel just to do a little molesting.  How about buy a van and get a mask? 
[02:43:00]  Oh, mighty.  I was referring to Michael Jackson.  Oh, you were?  Yeah, we saw that.  Oh, okay.  That was very clever.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Took long enough to get there.  I didn't understand.  You are the most misunderstood black woman in America.  You really think so?  Yeah.  Thank you.  I have no clue what the fuck you're saying.  What else you got?  You worked all night.  There has to be a few more.  I did work all night.  Anti-American spirits up in the Middle East.  Uh-oh.  A Newsweek report of the flushing of the Koran down the toilets by U.S. soldiers has only 
[02:43:30]  made matters worse.  Last week's story.  This is why...  Flushing of the what?  The Koran?  Korans.  The Korans?  Wait, wait, wait.  I didn't...  What was that?  The Korans...  The Bible book.  They have a Bible of their own?  Yeah.  It's called a Korans.  And what's in that Bible that's different than our Bible?  Wait, wait, wait.  I don't even understand what she's saying.  A Korans?  A Koran.  Koran.  Koran.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  Okay.  The Bible book.  Yeah.  It's a Bible for the Muslims.  And what kind of stuff is in that book, you think?  Well, there's probably creation.  And I think my dad told me that theirs is different because it has a lightning story in the beginning.  And it's very confusing, opposed to the Bible, which starts off with darkness and then it goes into lightness.  And then God creates, like, the earth and people.  Yeah.  But they have lightning.  That's great.  Lightning.  Then what happens?  I forget because the story is a little bit too long. 
[02:44:30]  The guy running with a kite?  Yeah.  No, but there's lightning, though.  Right?  Yeah.  Lightning.  Yeah.  That's all you need to know.  Okay.  It's probably the same story.  Okay.  What's wrong, Brad Pitt hair?  Yeah.  See, what's going on?  Nothing.  I gave Eric an update on the shirts.  Oh.  Well, we'd like an update.  Yeah.  What's the update?  Sure, buddy.  Thank you.  Apparently, the shirts were here at 7.55 this morning, but the security wouldn't let them upstairs in the freight elevator. 
[02:45:00]  Why is that?  And why didn't they call somebody or whatever?  I don't know.  No big deal.  All right.  Well, we're going to have the shirts.  We're going to have the shirts soon for the tens of people outside the studio.  Yes.  They really are sticklers in this building, that old drunk downstairs.  Well, I bet if it was a bottle of fucking Jack that showed up, you'd let it down the freight elevator after you emptied it into your liver. 
[02:45:30]  This is your fucking night watch with a Harry Chapin song.  All right.  Let's go, Francine.  Shithead.  So, what happened?  Newsweek reported a story about their Bible being flushed down the toilet.  Yep.  And what happened?  And they're going crazy over there.  So, this is why I don't understand why our president, George Bush, has allowed the lovely first lady, Laura Bush, to go on a quote-unquote goodwill tour to Jerusalem, where she's greeted with crowds screaming,  Why are you killed, your husband killed Muslim, and you are not welcome here, while visiting such sites as the Western Wall? 
[02:46:00]  Well, here's my theory.  Uh-oh.  This is President Bush's attempt to get away from First Lady Laura Bush so he can get closer to that sexpot, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.  Seems as though Bush is trying to get the black tail.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, like Francine, she goes for the racial angle. 
[02:46:30]  I kind of like that.  See, that angle being played right.  All right.  That's very, very clever, once again.  Do you think so?  I really do, yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I got one last story.  All right.  One last story.  Yep.  And coming, that's with C-U-M-I-N-G, to a laundromat, nail salon in public schools and cinemas near you, are free condoms.  And in his fight to stop the AIDS, Health Commissioner Thomas Friedman said yesterday, we can stop the HIV epidemic with the tools that we have today. 
[02:47:00]  Yes, we can wrap those tools up.  Mayor Bloomberg, who said he supports the Progressive Plan to Fight AIDS.  The what?  Progressive Plan to Fight AIDS.  We'll review the plan after a public comment, period, but it's not clear whether there will be any protests against the politically thorny issues of condom distribution, even though there have been protests in the past. 
[02:47:30]  Uh-huh.  And that's it.  That's it?  An excellent job.  I really didn't follow that last story.  Yeah, I didn't either.  She lost me.  Free condoms everywhere.  Yeah, I know, but I was kind of like, who cares?  Who cares?  So what, we're just going to be throwing them out on the street and you just pick them up and you can walk by and see one?  No, but it's so that people can use them like at clubs and stuff.  Right.  Opposed to...  You're giving them at clubs.  You're giving them at a nail salon. 
[02:48:00]  Right.  Yeah, so that's good for people who can't afford them.  You ought to give them to Bellevue orderlies just in case, you know, you see something you like and you know what you want to take.  What's yours?  Take your pick.  No reason to leave DNA all over the panties.  Right or wrong, guys.  He's laying around anyway.  That's right.  He gave one to your dad.  Terrible.  I don't know why that guy's in trouble.  You wouldn't get in big trouble if you went and stuck your dick in lettuce or in a tomato or a carrot.  Let's go to Matt in Nevada.  Matt. 
[02:48:30]  Matt?  Yeah.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, I was going to ask if Voss and this woman went to the same high school.  I didn't go to high school, stupid.  You didn't?  I quit.  Yeah?  Started my own business.  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  Ow.  Wow.  He's so angry.  You had to slam the phone down.  This chick is making me dizzy.  Does this girl have a mouth full of blue balls?  Yeah.  Could she be more stupid?  We love Francine. 
[02:49:00]  She had nothing on, like, Britney Spears or any of that other stuff going on.  It took me all night to write this.  Is this a new trainable video clip?  And, yeah, Hollywood Nova from Wackbag.  We'll let him on here.  Hollywood, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, y'all?  Hey.  Hey.  Check it.  Where's the sports, Francine?  Where's the sports?  Oh, the Pistons beat somebody last night.  81.  81.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah, Pacer fans.  All right.  The Pistons beat someone last night. 
[02:49:30]  There's a new NBA team called the Someones.  I forgot which one.  Well, that would be, I believe, the Heat.  Okay.  Yeah.  Fuck the Miami fans.  Fuck you guys.  You guys will not win.  Shaq is a bitch.  Rasheed Wallace will dunk all over your fucking asses.  Well, Shaq was a little injured.  He's just coming back from a little thing.  From a little thing there.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  It's the playoff.  Everybody gets injured.  Hey.  Dude, you got to say Shaquille, how dominant he is, man.  After he left the Lakers, I mean, they just stink. 
[02:50:00]  Hey.  All right.  Listen, we got to let you go because I see a FedEx man outside the studio.  There's a lot of yelling and screaming going on.  A lot of finger pointing going on, Anthony.  Poe out there.  I see Poe out there, and I see a couple boxes of shirts.  Have you seen any of the videos of Poe at the Star Wars opening?  No.  With him and the lightsaber doing the moves?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Poe is a master.  Yeah.  The lightsaber.  All right.  Guys, I got to go.  I got to go.  So I'll see you in D.C. later on today. 
[02:50:30]  Where are you going?  I had to leave a tent today because my car was in the shop for a week.  And the loaner.  Oh.  Why?  Wow.  I wish I could do a three-hour day.  Geez.  You're just leaving?  I have to.  I don't want to.  I never want to walk out.  We're having a great show.  But I have to bring my car back because they're going to start charging me.  Right.  If I don't, I can't just keep this loaner.  Well, um.  How much can they charge you?  I mean, you're a big headliner.  You know, an hour.  You're going to make an hour on radio.  Hold on.  Let me address John Turturro hairdo. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Nothing?  Nothing?  They gave me the answers, too.  I think it's good.  Yeah.  Just send me shirts back.  Let me see one, Opie.  They're just awful.  Let's see.  Let's see.  We got the, uh.  This was supposed to be a big deal today.  And, uh.  Would you get that out at a hamper?  And we have the shirts in studio, Anthony, finally.  And on the front it says, what the F.  Blank, blank, blank.  F, blank, blank, K is your problem, man. 
[02:51:30]  And then on the back it just says, Opie and Anthony.  Do me a favor.  The next time make the font smaller.  You can actually read this.  Each shirt comes with an electron microscope.  So you can fucking read it.  Yeah.  Way to commit to the product.  Jesus.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  All right.  Well.  I'll hand them out to the ten people online outside the studio.  Yeah.  That's just wonderful.  They said large.  Are there any excels in there, Hawk?  Let's hop to it.  Find one.  Give Francine a shirt.  She's lovely.  All right.  Well, before Francine leaves, someone has a suggestion. 
[02:52:00]  Have you smelled the back of Rich Voss's ear yet?  It smells like grape jelly.  Have you ever smelled it?  No.  It smells like grape jelly.  It's that stupid cologne you wear.  I'm telling you.  I know.  Dude, she makes the face like the guy in the rowboat that's fishing in Caddyshack.  Has anyone else noticed that?  What face is that?  Oh, my God.  You've noticed, right?  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  When the big boat that Rodney Dangerfield's driving, and then it splits the rowboat in half while  he's trying to do some fishing, the face he makes just before that happens, Francine's 
[02:52:30]  been making that face all morning.  Do you like blueberries?  Uh, only with, uh, toast.  I mean, the smell of blueberries.  Isn't it a nice smell?  It's more grape jelly, not blueberries.  I'm telling you.  It's more grape.  You think it's blueberries.  Yeah.  Behind his ears, it smells like grape jelly.  It's like a stupid cologne.  It's really not that bad.  We all have done it.  Everyone's done it.  All right.  Well, it's just stupid, because I'm telling you, it's a cologne.  Yeah, Francine, stay on mic for this.  It's really no big deal.  Basically, let me explain what's happening.  Rich Voss is kind of just rubbing behind his earlobe.  That's all.  That's all he's doing.  He's rubbing behind his earlobe.  He's getting a little goodness on his index finger. 
[02:53:00]  That's a stupid grape jelly smell.  Oh.  That smells like ass.  It doesn't smell like grape jelly.  Ew.  Is it bad today, Rich?  Oh, my ass.  It's like a...  It's like a fucking...  You don't want to be in a gross-out contest.  That's what makes it all fucking smash.  Yeah, it's basically cyst juice.  All right, try it again.  No way.  Yeah, try that one.  Try that one.  Just one more.  It's not faceable, though. 
[02:53:30]  What's wrong, Fred?  It really does smell like he just stuck his finger up.  Go away, motherfucker!  Get away from me.  You motherfucker!  You got to take some.  I think, Andrew, take some.  No, it's not going to happen.  Don't even fucking start.  Go away, motherfucker.  Did Ziggy ever take some?  Oh, no.  Oh, no?  I'm running out.  You're running out?  All right, Voss, why don't you go smoke?  Jimmy, go get your car.  Travis, what's up?  Bye, guys.  He just smelled it here.  Oh, he hasn't smelled it yet.  Do you have anything left?  Of course he does.  Just rub behind the ear again. 
[02:54:00]  Travis, this young go-getter.  Here, get Travis on mic, though.  Oh, that mic.  Don't touch your mic.  No, no, no, no.  All right.  Get away from me.  Talk to Von Voss' mic, not mine.  Yeah.  Make sure you got a good one, though, Voss.  Shut up.  It's awful.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm out for a couple days now.  Terrible.  All right, there you have it.  A couple days.  Sometimes people puke when they smell that finger, but...  Did Bob Kelly ever get any of that?  I think Bob Kelly...  Wow, Bob would really be good.  Yeah.  He would really start puking. 
[02:54:30]  Jesus.  Oh, fucking...  Oh, pinwheel belly.  That asshole.  Hey, Bob, I stepped in shit.  Get him, man.  All right, listen.  Brian in Delaware has something real fast.  Brian, go ahead.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hi.  I wanted to mention about Von Voss.  He's the biggest wuss I've ever seen in my life.  You're right.  I had a show in Baltimore last week.  Oh, yeah.  Where was it, brother?  Where was the show?  In Baltimore.  Oh.  He was... 
[02:55:00]  There was a mouse that ran on stage,  and I have never seen a guy act more like a girl trying to stand up on his stool,  and he ran out in the audience knocking tables over.  It was one table.  Knocking down mailboxes, driving through people's backyards.  That's baby shit compared to what this dude was doing.  But tell the truth, did I kill?  You killed the mouse?  Yeah.  No, I killed him on the street.  Wait, dude, this is at the improv?  Yeah.  What city?  In Baltimore.  Oh.  Because I'm thinking, I'm going to be in D.C. soon.  I wasn't sure if I was out. 
[02:55:30]  So this guy was...  You're on stage...  Hold on.  You're on stage in D.C. in a fucking mouse run.  No one.  Right, dude?  Was it D.C.?  No, it was in Baltimore.  No one could say it right.  All right.  It was in Baltimore.  And Voss just freaked out because the mouse was on stage?  Oh, yeah.  Standing up on a stool, knocking glasses and tables over,  running out into the audience.  Oh, that's a man act.  Got a cyst behind it, do you?  I don't do that, boys.  All right.  Thanks, Ryan.  Next time, keep your badge on your cyst.

[03:01:30]  Ah, man, what a show today.  Having lots and lots of fun. 
[03:02:00]  Rich Voss, thanks for stopping by today.  Rich is hanging.  Yeah, I don't have a lot today.  I'm kind of burnt, man, this fucking weekend.  A lot of ONA fans came out to Caroline.  Thanks, man.  I'm sorry to make it.  I went down to Florida.  Anthony went out to Colorado.  It was fun.  Colorado.  Dave's out of his mind, but it was crazy.  Yeah, right on.  Cool.  I want to talk about Star Wars and all that, but we've got a guest that's about to make his,  a couple of guests that will be in here in a second. 
[03:02:30]  But what's up, Kenny?  We'll probably talk about Star Wars with them also, because Adam actually had experience working  on the first one and the second one.  Oh, very cool.  No, I had a thought in my head, but it's like past now.  Of course it is.  I was going to hand out the t-shirts if you want me to.  Yeah, the t-shirts are here.  I guess we'll be handing them out in a few minutes.  Yeah, why not?  All right, go down there and get on the phone, and we'll go to you in between talking to  these guys, okay? 
[03:03:00]  Those guys, the Mythbusters, are really cool.  Do you want to ask them something before you leave?  Well, me and my boys are big fans of their show.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  They're smart.  They blow things up.  They do educational things.  I've watched the show many times.  Yeah, they're good like that.  Yeah.  Well, let's get the guys from Mythbusters in here, Eric.  It's a very fast-paced show they got.  Don't scare anybody.  Step away from that chair a little bit, you freak. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, because these guys aren't going to know how to handle you.  Yeah, they are.  It's Jamie and Adam.  How are you doing, guys?  Very good.  How are you?  Yeah, very good.  I'm like starstruck now.  I watch the show every single time it's on.  Freaking out.  It's actual celebrities to me.  Really?  Anybody else they drag in here?  Like, you know, Ozzy came in, and of course, Jimmy Norton's a big fan of Ozzy Osbourne,  and he sat down, but it was just like, eh, Ozzy.  But you guys are like, you know, I watch you on TV.  You're like real celebrities to me.  Do you want Kenny to ask the first question before he goes downstairs? 
[03:04:00]  This guy's 6'4", and he's big and stupid.  He's really, yeah, he's a big fan.  He's very stupid.  He's like, big and stupid.  Here he is.  You were calling me?  But he likes the show.  Kenny, be nice to our guests.  No, I'm excited.  It's Adam and Jamie from Mythbusters.  No, I've got to get their autograph for my boys.  Really?  Yeah, they're huge fans.  We never miss a show.  These guys do cool stuff.  They blow things up.  They play with mannequins.  That's what I like.  Yeah, what's your question? 
[03:04:30]  Do you ever learn anything?  No, that's impossible.  You know me.  That's impossible.  Yeah, that's just beyond comprehension for me.  But these guys look really smart.  They are smart.  Yeah, yeah, they've got a cool show, I'm telling you.  All right, what's the question?  Listen to me when I'm telling you something.  What's the question?  No, hi.  Hi, how are you doing?  No, I'm not high.  You have nothing.  See how witty he was?  Would you go out and give out T-shirts?  You don't have anything?  You don't have a question for these guys?  Thank you, Mythbusters, for coming to the opening of the Anthony Show. 
[03:05:00]  Our pleasure.  All right, I'm sorry for having us.  All right.  Sorry for that distraction.  All right, so back to Anthony here.  Adam and Jamie from Mythbusters in studio.  Yes.  I absolutely want to know how you hooked up with the show,  because it seemed like one of those things that maybe if you just gave the idea out to somebody,  it didn't seem like it might catch on, but it's really, really caught on.  And I know a lot of people that watch it and enjoy it.  Well, actually, the idea came to the mind of our producer, Peter Reese,  who was a producer for a show on Discovery called Beyond 2000 for about 10 years. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  A technology magazine-style show.  And he thought up the idea for Mythbusters and pitched it to Discovery.  And when they were looking around for talent,  he had actually interviewed Jamie and I as part of the original Robot Wars,  the precursor to BattleBots back in, like, 1996.  Well, Jamie was a competitor.  With his lethal robot, Blendo.  Blendo.  Yeah, it was about the nastiest thing that had ever been made at that point.  We had four matches, and none of them lasted longer than about four seconds. 
[03:06:00]  What type of bot was it?  It was the first of what they call spinners,  and so it was essentially a 150-pound flywheel spinning at about 500 RPM.  I noticed the flippers usually did better against the spinners.  Well, not against our spinners.  Not against yours?  No, no.  We just had to touch them, and it was over.  We just fly against the wall or something.  We had the distinction of when BattleBots finally came,  we could see that the arena accommodated for Blendo specifically. 
[03:06:30]  Really?  With a roof on the arena.  Because we kept tossing pieces of our opponents up over the barrier and into the audience,  and that's why they kept on.  That adds an element of fun to the whole thing.  Yeah, exactly.  I put it this way.  When Blendo was spun up,  it was the equivalent of getting hit by a chunk of brass the size of your fist  going to the speed of sound.  That was the math.  I could do some damage.  Well, so when Peter called up Jamie back in, I think, the beginning of 2002  and said,  Would you be interested in hosting this show,  the Science Show on Discovery Channel? 
[03:07:00]  And Jamie said,  Well, I think I might be interested,  but I'm not sure I'd actually be dynamic enough to hold a show on my own.  But I've got this friend,  and together we might make a good team.  And we shot a 14-minute demo reel we sent to them.  And apparently, they loved it.  They sent it to Discovery.  And Discovery said to us,  These are just the geeks we were looking for.  Really?  And apparently they said to each other,  Just what we need,  a couple of homosexuals from San Francisco.  Oh, my God. 
[03:07:30]  But we're not gay.  We're not gay.  You make the beret look cool again, though, bro.  I've got to give it to you, man.  But I definitely, the personalities are definitely different.  I watched the kind of like the outtake show that you guys put together,  which is really, really funny.  And it seems like a lot of people kind of goof on you, Jamie,  a little bit about your personality  and you're kind of the business guy out of the crew.  Well, they goof on both of us.  And, you know, I think the choice of us as a team 
[03:08:00]  turned out to be a really good call  that might not be apparent when you watch the show.  And that's because we have what I think of as binocular vision.  When we're dealing with a subject,  we're coming at it from such different personalities  and points of view that it really displays the subject matter,  which, I mean, we clown around a lot.  We have a lot of fun.  But ultimately, we'd like to get as much science in there  because that's, you know, you may watch the show because it's funny,  but you'll stay with the show 
[03:08:30]  because there's a lot of interesting content in it.  I'm a complete techno geek, so, you know, I just love when you guys,  and what you were just talking about,  when you have to attack a problem  and build two separate things alone,  the way you guys go about it is just hysterical, the differences.  I mean, you really, Adam, you really come off as like the clown  that just, you look and go,  how did he even get that to work kind of thing.  And you always expect Jamie to build a better machine than yours. 
[03:09:00]  Sorry, I don't mean to insult you or anything.  I'd like to point out...  It's where the personality just comes out.  Hey, I'd like to point out that I found a needle in a haystack first.  That is true.  I did see that.  You're a little...  Wait, how do you go about finding the needle in a haystack?  Well, they gave us four different needles of different sizes,  small, medium, really large,  and then they gave us this bone needle.  And, of course, the first thing we'd both think of  is some type of magnetic finder or metal detector.  The bone needle made it exponentially more difficult. 
[03:09:30]  So, actually, Jamie used fire to burn all of his hay  and look through the ashes for the small bits.  And I used water to actually...  These agitating paddle wheels that fed the hay through a trough  and hopefully the bone needle would fall to the bottom.  And I also had magnets to find the...  We both had magnets to find the metal needles.  And our producer, of course, always liking a good challenge,  gave us 1,000 pounds of hay,  which is like, if you fluffed it,  is enough to fill this room about four times. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, and, you know, while Adam's worked better,  mine was cooler.  It was.  Fire is always cooler.  And that's part of the show that I think everybody loves.  And I envy you guys.  The amount of explosives you guys get to use is amazing.  And each time it seems to be like you're getting more and more.  Well, yeah.  I mean, the most recent really large one we did,  blowing up the cement truck.  The cement truck was amazing.  What was that one about?  Well, the myth is can you use a stick of dynamite  to clean out cement that's hardened in the side of a cement truck. 
[03:10:30]  You've heard about the...  There is a myth out there that some guy had left the cement in the cement truck  and it dried, and then they used dynamite to loosen it up.  Yeah, and it turned out that a single stick of dynamite inside a truck  with a little residue in it is, I mean, we don't want to recommend it,  but it actually works quite well.  Yeah.  Because it just kind of sends out a shock wave,  and it loosens the stuff, and it makes it easier to clean out.  But, of course...  It looks really boring.  Yeah, there's a puff of smoke.  Yeah, there's this puff. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, so doing what we do on the show,  we had to take it as far as we could,  and that involved 800 pounds of what is called ANFO,  which is, you know, a fertilizer-diesel fuel mix,  and we had to be about a mile and a half away to see what that would do.  The truck disappeared.  The camera was a mile away, and parts of the truck flew over the camera.  Wow.  And when we tried to get...  This is actually one of the things we love about the show.  We tried to get a permit to actually blow up a cement truck,  and it turned out there's nobody in the world licensed 
[03:11:30]  to use enough explosives to blow up a cement truck.  So our researchers, who are this brilliant team of four researchers  that can get us to do anything,  found that, well, why don't we go to the guys who write the permits,  even if a permit doesn't exist,  and she got the FBI bomb squad...  That's a great idea.  ...to agree to hold a training exercise.  Oh, is that what it was?  Yeah, that's what they called it.  And, I mean, the FBI bomb squad, I have to say,  is the tightest crew we've ever worked with.  Those guys are great.  They also helped us out on a myth for... 
[03:12:00]  Well, we're hosting Shark Week this July.  Oh, you are?  And they helped us out on a myth for Shark Week.  Can you blow up a scuba tank by shooting it with a .30-06?  From Jaws, of course.  Yeah.  We've learned not to egg on the normal pyros,  because, you know, there can be problems.  But the bomb squad, the FBI, they, you know, you can't mess with them.  They're going to do what they know how to do, and you'll be safe.  I'm amazed at some of the stuff you get away with doing.  Yeah, you would think that nobody would ever allow you to do this. 
[03:12:30]  When you took the jet engine, and the rumor, of course,  is that the thrust coming out of the jet engine could flip the vehicle over.  You ever see that one?  I've heard the myth, sure.  Yeah, it happened down in Rio de Janeiro.  Yeah.  That was actually one of, I think it was one of our single great failure, that myth.  Yeah.  Because we were down in the Mojave Desert,  and we were trying to find someone with a 747 that they would turn on  and let us have a car behind.  And we found that out in the Mojave Desert airport, 
[03:13:00]  they mothball planes out there because it's perfect, no precipitation,  the weather is great.  I've heard about that.  They retire planes out in the middle of the desert, right?  Yeah, because they last forever out there.  So there's these companies that take these planes out of the hangars every month  and just start them up to make sure the engines keep running.  And we were like,  we just want to be behind one of these planes when you turn it on.  Wow.  And they were totally cool about it,  and we're standing out there on the runway.  We've got a 747.  It's just about to fire.  We've got a remote-controlled taxi cab right here. 
[03:13:30]  And the insurance company's on the phone with us saying,  we're no longer comfortable with doing this.  You can't do it.  And we're thinking,  do we just do it?  Do we just push the car 50 feet forward and say,  screw it?  Yeah, and it was so frustrating because what's the plane going to suck the car around the front of the intake?  You know, it's way behind the jet.  You know, the jet is going to push the car away from the airplane.  What's the problem?  You guys look like you're pretty safe at what you're doing,  even though it's insane some of the things.  One of the most unsafe things was Adam inside the remote-controlled car that Jamie was controlling with a remote. 
[03:14:00]  Or not controlling.  And he proceeded to just drive straight into a fence.  Well, we had a little problem with some switches.  What can I say?  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  A couple of problems with the switches?  Yeah, there was some that didn't work.  He lost control.  My favorite part of that is as the car's driving away and the staff's all kind of watching in horror,  you hear me go,  Jamie!  From the inside of the car. 
[03:14:30]  How do you get insurance for those things?  It seems impossible.  Well, we have a routine that we work through with regard to the insurance and our safety in general,  which we're very concerned about.  And it's like a flow chart that we developed specifically for Mythbusters.  And it rates the risk and the probability of having a problem with that risk.  And it sort of is one of these things where, you know, you kind of follow the numbers and 
[03:15:00]  you end up in the, if you end up in the really far corner, you know, it's in the black zone  and that's a problem.  And we've noticed.  But we're always in the black zone.  Oh, there's stuff that you just couldn't do that you wanted to do?  What's the worst thing that can happen?  Well, we could drop a car on somebody.  And how likely is that?  Well, even if it's really unlikely, the fact that it means death, we're in the black zone.  Are there things that you just couldn't do based on insurance or somebody saying, no, that's crazy?  We always figure out a way of doing it.  You've got a way of doing it?  Yeah, even if it means doing it like a replica of it or something else. 
[03:15:30]  Or doing it with a crash test dummy while we're all standing behind a bunker.  Yeah.  You ever afraid you're going to run out of myths?  Well, not at all.  You know, the answer to that one is when are people going to start doing stupid stuff?  You know, it's a...  There's no end to this stuff.  And really, by this point, the fans have really dialed in to what works and doesn't work on the show.  And about 30% of the myths we test now come right off the Discovery fan site and emails that Jamie and I get directly.  That's cool.  People are really plugged in. 
[03:16:00]  Someone on the Instant Feedback is writing in saying the best episode was when one of you guys went across the San Francisco Bay in the raincoats.  Like the Escape from Alcatraz.  Oh, yeah.  The Escape from Alcatraz.  That's my...  Which they've said for years can't be done, right?  That's my personal favorite because, you know, there's been a lot of reenactments of it.  They've done it on a lot of TV shows.  But Jamie and I read all 1,800 pages of the FBI report.  We went to the Maritime Museum in San Francisco where they have all the artifacts from the investigation.  We looked at them. 
[03:16:30]  And I think our builder's eyes were the first to really come up with a truly accurate rendition of the boat they probably made.  And we had no idea.  My favorite is when we have no idea what's going to happen.  And we had no idea if this boat was going to be remotely seaworthy.  And Jamie climbs in and squirms across the bottom in the middle of the night north of Alcatraz.  And that thing carried us all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge in like an hour.  Three and a half miles.  Yeah.  And it was the same conditions that they were under?  Exact same tidal conditions, same temperature, same weather, same wind. 
[03:17:00]  We really, really went the extra mile.  And the boat was built out of 24 rubber raincoats.  Jesus.  Yeah, we even had to go to the trouble of finding actual latex raincoats like what they would use in those days.  Right.  And most of them are vinyl or some other plastic today.  So it was very authentic.  And we had to climb through those little holes.  Yeah.  We had to climb through the holes that they had dug in the cells.  They were like, sure, go ahead.  And I was amazed that we were both able to fit.  That isn't some of the roughest things you've done, though, because, Adam, I've seen you go above and beyond with the goldfinger. 
[03:17:30]  Well, I have contributed at this point every single major body fluid to the show.  Yeah.  To the name of science.  Except for spinal fluid.  We haven't done that.  He's not afraid of the anal probe.  Whoa, hey.  Well, there's the myth that the girl in Goldfinger, the movie Goldfinger, painted with the gold paint, that she died because she couldn't breathe her skin. 
[03:18:00]  You need to be able to breathe through your skin.  So they leave that strip down the spine so you could breathe.  And, well.  It's total crap.  Yeah.  It's crap.  And Adam tried it out.  So they painted him gold.  And they wanted to monitor everything.  His heart rate.  Core body temperature.  Core body temperature.  So they actually stuck at the monitor of his ass as he's just standing there on television.  And all of a sudden he starts singing Moon River.  Moon River.  That old gag. 
[03:18:30]  You're not the shy one.  No.  Well, you know that EMT who actually did that, Sanjay.  We use the same EMT company for a lot of our myths.  So we're real familiar with those guys.  Sanjay hasn't been out since then.  Really?  Yeah.  I think he's got a little too much crap from his coworkers.  Because I asked him if he'd respect me in the morning.  Let's go to the phones, Ant.  They have exploded.  Say hi to Floyd.  Hey, Floyd.  Hello.  We have Jamie and Adam from Mythbusters in studio today.  Yeah, guys.  I've got a problem with your myth that you did with the cell phone at the gas station. 
[03:19:00]  I deliver fuel for a living, and you guys apparently disproved that myth or busted it.  But in our constant training, we have continual videos where the fire department, and they've  caught videos just at local gas stations that have caught people using their cell phones  that create fires.  Well, what we found in our research was that there was not a single recorded case in the  entire world of a confirmed cell phone starting a fire, that it is likely if you're using your 
[03:19:30]  cell phone and filling up your tank and getting in and out of your car, you're building up  a static charge.  And we proved absolutely that static electricity is more than enough to ignite gasoline fumes  at the pump, and that's a very dangerous situation.  And someone talking on their cell phone might be more likely to not be paying attention to  what they're doing, but that there is...  And we also consulted with the Petroleum Equipment Institute, PEI, which is the world 
[03:20:00]  authority on petroleum devices like the gas pumps and...  And accidents at the pumps.  They compile all the data on accidents at pumps.  I think they have a little more info than the guy that just called it.  Well, that's something.  I'd give it to these guys over here.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for an industry erring on the side of caution, but it's just...  And, you know, every time someone's cell phone battery blows up in their pocket, we get  an email, but when you consider that there's probably a billion, what do you call them,  like aftermarket batteries out of China in everybody's pockets, we can't find the battery 
[03:20:30]  that's been misbuilt, that's going to short.  We try and short batteries.  While you're filling up your gas tank.  Exactly.  And there's also an interesting thing that we found out recently.  The FBI bomb squad and other people that handle explosives are in a habit of...  In fact, they make a rule of not having any radio transmissions in the area when they're  dealing with explosives.  However, they're not so concerned about the cell phones as they are about the... 
[03:21:00]  Like a high-powered police portable radio or something like that.  It is apparently possible to create a spark from a radio transmission.  It's just that cell phones themselves have such a low wattage that it's virtually impossible  for that to happen as far as we're aware.  Every time I see on the gas pump, don't use your cell phone now, I think of the Mythbusters.  Well, you know, one thing the Petroleum Equipment Institute did tell us was in their compilation  of figures per year that in the two years since our first test of that aired, that static 
[03:21:30]  electricity accidents at gas stations have gone down 60%.  So we might have actually saved four or five lives with our show.  All right.  Let's go to Texas, Anthony.  Texas, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  You guys all right?  All right.  How are you?  Doing good.  I just wanted to call in.  Jerry, Adam, love the show.  It's a favorite thing.  It looks like awesome.  I'm a big freaking geek, and I catch it every week, and it's on TiVo, so I can watch it  again.  Another question I had is, are the season DVDs coming out, or are they out?  And if so, where are they available? 
[03:22:00]  There are DVDs available through the Discovery website.  However, there's a bit of a lag time.  We're not sure what exactly they're up to right now, but you can get some of them, and  there will be more in the future, I'm sure.  All right.  Sorry about that.  Let's go to Kerry in California, trying to give everyone a shot here.  Kerry, what's up?  Hey, guys.  You guys did a myth about blowing up various things in the sun in your car, and I got a  $200 bill that says this pop bottle will blow up in your car. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  You know, that was my bad.  Oh, really?  My bad.  Yeah.  I totally screwed that one up.  The myth is about a soda can or an aerosol can exploding with a lot of force in the back  of a hot car.  And when it came to the end of a day, we were able to actually get these things to blow  up in very hot environments, but that it was unlikely for cars to get that hot.  And it turns out that all over the country, there are plenty of places where cars actually  get up to like 190 to 200 degrees in a car, and that's enough to heat up certain cans of 
[03:23:00]  soda or aerosol to blow up.  Which also brings up one of Mythbusters' favorite lines, and that is that failure is always an  option.  You know, with us, one thing I've got to say about the show for the viewers out there,  we're not so concerned about providing definitive proof about some scientific fact.  We're more interested in the process.  For us personally and for viewers of the show, you know, the most valuable thing that we've 
[03:23:30]  got to offer on the show is following us through as we're trying to figure these things  out.  Sometimes we get it right.  Sometimes we get it wrong.  If we get it wrong, we'll often have another go at it.  That's one of those stories that we may well have another go at.  Yeah, we're willing to say that we're wrong.  You know, it's not science.  Jamie's got a degree in Russian, and I've got a high school diploma.  We have no qualifications.  Well, and as far as science, I think real scientists that contact us actually kind of point out the 
[03:24:00]  fact that that's what science is actually like.  It's not like these guys in white lab coats that show up and, you know, just say this  is the case.  It's an ongoing process.  Science is a very mushy thing that you learn a few things, but it's not often real clear  cut.  The process is the most fun part of the show, because obviously you would know that you  cannot jump in an elevator as it's free falling and live through it. 
[03:24:30]  I don't think there's anybody that's going to watch that and go, hmm, I wonder how this  is going to work out.  But the process, you guys doing it, the fun of being able to drop an elevator like that,  that's what people tune in for.  There is a moment on every shoot, about once a week, when we all look around and we're standing  there.  There's a team of people downstairs in this abandoned crack hotel, and I'm upstairs with  a 10,000 pound special next quick release trying to release this elevator, and we're  thinking, what the hell are we doing? 
[03:25:00]  Who is paying to let us do this crap?  It's incredible.  What a great way to make a living.  The phones are honestly just nuts.  Anthony in Queens, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing over there?  I got a quick question for the Ms. Buster guys.  Are you guys ever going to do the, in hindsight, it was a bad idea to light a match, man?  Yeah, if you guys want some ratings.  Well, if you want, just take it to the next level.  I have to tell you, we have...  We're talking about the gerbil in the ass story, obviously. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, that one.  Remember that one?  In hindsight, lighting the match was a bad idea.  It started, and it was sent as a legitimate news story, like a doctor did a press conference  and talked about this.  Well, actually, we want to do a whole special on things concerning farts, and that would  fit right in there, but...  We're not allowed to say the word fart on the show, but with facts about flatulence, I  think we can cover a wide range of things that have never been covered on television,  and our challenge is to do it in a tasteful manner.  Good luck.  I liked one of my favorites also, involving rank smells, was the dead pig inside the car. 
[03:26:00]  You know, on humid days, you can still catch a whiff of it from Danny's parking lot.  Really?  Yeah.  Someone is saying that's the most disgusting thing you guys have done.  They took...  What was the myth?  The myth is that somebody died in a classic car, and their family member cleaned them out,  as it were, but they couldn't sell this classic car, even for a great deal, because...  It was mint condition.  It was mint condition, beautiful car.  They couldn't sell it because someone had died in it, and they just couldn't get rid of 
[03:26:30]  the smell.  So you took dead pigs.  Yeah.  We got a...  I believe it was an 87 Corvette, and at first, we just kind of put the pig in there and let  it sit for a while, and then the whole area out in front of the shop was like, you know,  really started to get weird, and so we get packing tape, and we're taping up all the corner,  all around the door seals, and we let that sit for a while, and then that didn't work,  and so finally, we got a container, a shipping container, and put it in there, and... 
[03:27:00]  And sealed it up for a few months.  Sealed it up, but, you know, we had time-lapse cameras stuck in here, but even they couldn't  handle it.  They kept failing because of the ammonia concentration.  Yeah.  Wow.  And that turned out to be the biggest problem with the car, was that the corrosion from  all of these gases and fluids and things that kind of leave the pig and go elsewhere  are extremely corrosive, and, you know, we would have had to pull the dash and strip  out every single little thing. 
[03:27:30]  This car had computerized things in it, and, you know, it just was...  While you could, in fact, you know, get the smell out of a car, it turned out to be totally  impractical, down to the point of where you would have to remove every single nut and  bolt to, like, completely pull it out of whatever it was screwed into, and clean the threads  with a toothbrush and a special enzyme, and then put it back.  This stuff is so...  This juice that was coming off the pigs, which, by the time we had to clean them out, were  more like a hairy, bony pudding than... 
[03:28:00]  Oh, my God.  This juice that came off them was so powerful in its smell that I could take a single drop  of it, put it somewhere in your car, and you'd just want to sell your car.  Really?  And you'd never get rid of the smell.  We had this great guy that was a crime scene cleaner.  That's what he made his living from.  Do you remember the name of that company?  His name was Neil Smither, and he discovered his life's mission watching the scene where  they cleaned up the body out of the car in Pulp Fiction.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, there you go.  And he's now got this company called Crime Scene Cleaners.  They have deals with hotels.  I think we've talked to them.  They clean up meth labs. 
[03:28:30]  You know, that company or one that's very similar.  Well, when we opened the door to that Corvette, and he was standing there watching, just laughing,  you know, as we're just squirming, you know, he offered one of us $5,000 to lick the pig.  And he was good for it.  The guy makes a lot of dough, and they knew he was good for it.  And I looked at the pig, and I looked at him, and I was like, you know, he goes, and I  don't mean no tongue touching either.  I was like, oh, give it a good lick.  And people now say to me, oh, man, I would have done it. 
[03:29:00]  And I was like, if you were there, you would not have done it.  Yeah, you know, if you mention that story to both of us, it's kind of hard to describe,  but we both kind of get quiet for a little bit, you know, remembering what we went through.  I mean, I had to get into that car and sit on what was left of the pig that was in the  driver's seat.  Just to move the car.  Just to get the car out of the container.  They had to close the door around me.  And, you know, what was inside the car, actually, and we were wearing respirators, but what was 
[03:29:30]  inside the car wasn't anything like air anymore.  It wasn't like stinky air.  It was something else.  Something from another planet.  Yeah.  I needed, I like needed a separate air source to be able to deal with that.  It changed Jamie's DNA.  All right, let's go to the phones.  Let's go to Florida.  Ryan, what's up?  Hey.  Oh, I love the Mythbusters.  Yeah, definitely.  Jamie and Adam in studio.  Ah, the best episode ever was one where they blew up the house with the bug bombs.  Yeah.  I got an idea for a myth for him to bust.  What do you got?  So I can get Pat and Naki in there and see how much milk he can drink before he actually 
[03:30:00]  hurls.  We, yeah, had a little contest of, during Christmas, some big fat guy came up and drank eggnog.  We saw how much eggnog he could drink until he puked it up.  How much was it?  Like a couple of gallons?  Yeah, a gallon, gallon and a half, something like that.  A gallon, gallon, because I've heard you can't drink a gallon of milk in less than an hour  without puking.  Yeah, this guy just stunned me.  It was eggnog, too.  You haven't done that myth yet on the show?  Puking's always funny, man.  Puking and bobbing is good.  And I have puked on the show.  Yeah.  But I've puked several times now. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  What's the blowing up the house one?  Oh, this is about somebody who wanted to get rid of bugs in their house, and they went  and got bug bombs.  And, you know, bug bombs says it's good for 800 square feet or something like that.  You do hear about this every so often.  It happens in California all the time, seven or eight times a year.  And so they went and got 40 bug bombs, set them all off in their house, and we did a  lot of bench testing with this, and we made several ignition sources, like a stove igniter,  a wire short, a static spark. 
[03:31:00]  And again, that's the fun part, is watching how you guys come up with these ways of igniting  these things, or working, making the stove turn on, flipping a light switch.  Yeah, and everything we tried ignited the bug bomb stuff.  So we got a house, actually, down at a military base, Moffat Field in California, and we set  off 40 bug bombs, and we were really hoping for a lot more destruction.  Yeah.  But in the end, it blew these double-pane, tempered glass back doors out, and on the  high-speed camera, you can see them bowing, like, really a good five or six inches before 
[03:31:30]  popping out of their frame.  Yeah, and the flames come shooting out the door.  Yeah.  I like that one.  The other one, you cracked me up when you take the dummy and dropped him into the water  and off the crane.  Yeah, that was called the hammer drop, and the premise with that one was that if you  throw a large object or something like a hammer in front of you, that you'll break the water  tension if you're, say, like jumping off a bridge or falling off a bridge, and that aeration 
[03:32:00]  or loss of water tension would allow you to survive an otherwise deadly fall.  But, um...  No.  No.  No, it didn't work.  And he was so mangled that, uh, Adam, for some reason, the worst beating the dummy takes,  the more you laugh.  Oh, God.  It comes out like, ah, his leg came off!  You just, you've never heard anything like that body hitting the water from 200 feet.  It was shocking.  And then to find this crash test dummy, which is, you know, what we expected when we first 
[03:32:30]  got the crash test dummy, is you could do anything to it.  And to find that merely dropping him into the water would shatter his cast steel shoulders.  I mean, it was appalling.  Well, recently, there's an episode that we just finished, another visit to Mojave, that  involved a story about whether you can, um, uh, survive a crash from an airplane by jumping  out first and hanging on to the, um, the, the, uh, escape slide or the life raft.  And it was kind of, it was done in Indiana Jones, I believe, firstly. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  And so we get a hold of this big helicopter, and we get a hold of these inflatable life things,  and, and, uh, there were a couple of times that, uh, before the, um, uh, before we really  got our act together that Buster simply fell out, you know, because there, there wasn't  anything really good to hold on to on, on the life rafts, the little strings and things  that fell.  From 2,000 feet.  Yeah, he, he falls from 2,000 feet, and every single, uh, part of his body was separated. 
[03:33:30]  It was just like seeing, uh, you know, a grenade go off with the little bits going everywhere  for, for quite some while.  And I was up in the helicopter, I'm hanging out the side of this, like, 1950s Sikorsky  helicopter, and I'm looking down at, from 2,000 feet above the desert floor, and it is  a total Wile E. Coyote moment.  Because I watch Buster go, until he is no longer visible, and then there's a puff of smoke.  Oh, that's great, man.  It really is.  Your background, uh, with, with movies, especially, uh, Adam, I was, I was looking at your bio, 
[03:34:00]  you worked on Star Wars.  I worked on the first two Star Wars films, uh, Jamie's worked on films as far back as  RoboCop and Arachnophobia.  Um, yeah.  You were a model maker?  Yeah, yeah, uh, worked at Industrial Light and, well, I got my start working for Jamie,  actually, on commercials, like, uh, Nike, Hershey's Kisses, Owens Corning, Coca-Cola, and,  and, of course, Charmin, uh, of course, yeah, I played Mr. Whipple's stock boy in the Charmin 
[03:34:30]  commercial.  Who's the stock boy in all the Charmin commercials?  Oh, no kidding, yeah, back around, like, 1982, 83.  You are famous.  And you were, I guess you were squeezing it?  I, uh, no, actually, I was the stock boy, Jimmy, and I was nervous because the roof was  leaking all over the new Charmin, and I guess Mr. Whipple's really cheap because he was  still willing to sell it, because the new Charmin is stronger when wet.  It's sort of like Adam's come full circle, you know, dealing with things involving bodily  fluids.  Well, actually, it involved this nearly pornographic line where he shows me the quarter trick with 
[03:35:00]  the towelettes, you know, and, oh, it can still hold the quarters, and I say, gosh, Mr.  Whipple, that's what I call wet strength.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's one for the Christmas take, Christmas party.  Now, uh, did you see the new Star Wars?  I, actually, I was going to go to a matinee today.  Oh, really?  Yes.  All right.  Yeah, I saw it.  Very good.  I liked it.  Much better than the previous two that he put out.  I want to find out if I can take my six-year-old twin boys to it. 
[03:35:30]  Probably not, unless you're, like, the cool dad who, you know, my father took me to Bonnie  and Clyde when I was, like, seven years old or something like that.  Yeah, my parents took me to Sharky's machine when I was, like, nine, and I remember  running out screaming at the killer Freebaser.  Hopey parents.  Hey, let's go back to the phones here and say hi to Dan.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I got a question for Adam.  Last season, you had a date one night, and you wound up singeing all the hair off your  eyebrows and head.  Yes.  How'd the date go? 
[03:36:00]  The date went just fine, thank you.  And did you shave everything else to match?  What happened?  No, it turned out only the top part was singed, and with some good scrubbing, you couldn't  even, I didn't even smell that burnt.  A little more flame action.  I can't remember which one that was.  That was actually the early testing on Cell Phone Destroyer's gas station.  We were trying to create an environment where we got a static spark to ignite a small chamber  of gasoline, and as often happens on the show, we spent three days just trying to prove gasoline 
[03:36:30]  is flammable.  We were really flummoxed by it, and by the time it finally ignited, we were so blasÃ©  and so kind of, well, nothing's going to happen, that I had my face right up against this thing,  and a big fireball kind of enveloped my head.  Yeah, in front of his hair was gone, and his eyebrows.  No kidding.  We found that Adam kind of gets frisky after he gets hurt.  In fact, the last time, the most notable time that he did this involved the vacuum cleaner  motor that he, and Adam, would you care to tell us what happened after you got hurt by 
[03:37:00]  that one?  I've heard about this one as well.  Yeah, we were testing out some vacuum cleaner motors, and this guy at the vacuum cleaner  shop handed me what he said was the most powerful motor, and we turned it on, and it felt really  powerful, and I was like, you know, putting my hand up, it would whee, whee, like this,  and I thought, ooh, and so I, for some reason, I kind of put my lips up to it, and I didn't  know that it would yank my lips like a full inch and a half into its blades, but it did,  and I had this total fight club, you know, bloody teeth kind of moment, and I actually 
[03:37:30]  went home that night and asked my girlfriend to marry me.  Oh, will you marry me?  Romantic moment.  Give us a kiss.  Really fast, we got a guy that cleans up dead bodies for a living.  Keith.  Hey, oh, man.  What's up?  The Lick-A-Stick and Mythbusters rule.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  Hey, I just called because I wanted to let you guys know you did the best that you possibly  could to describe what a dead body smells like, and I used to clean them up for a living.  Sometimes they'd be there two, three months, sometimes they'd be there a couple days, and 
[03:38:00]  you never, ever get that smell out of your nose, and you just can't possibly get the  point across to anybody how bad a human body, or even a pig, because I guess that's the  most similar, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they're the most similar.  You can't get the point across to people how bad and how amazingly horrible that smell  is when the body decays.  That death smell, that dead body smell.  You know, even if you're walking around your yard, a cat had died or something, that waft  hits you.  You know exactly what it is, and it's just so pungent. 
[03:38:30]  Now, the only thing that comes at a close second would be homeless poo.  Oh, here in Manhattan, you catch a lot of that.  You know what I'm talking about?  Tippy Tom's excrement.  But the best one I have for you guys is, it's a real quick one.  Two to three months, this poor lady was on her bed, had fallen out of bed, broke her neck,  and laying on the floor, she decayed everything except for her leg, and she whipped up into  the drywall about six feet.  And it was an amazing smell.  And at home, the flies and everything else that took over the whole place. 
[03:39:00]  Punch it out, T-Boys.  Lovely story.  You have a couple of additions to the show now.  I've noticed some new faces.  Well, there's too many myths for Jamie and I to bust in a single season.  We've got 26, 28 episodes to do per year, and there's just not enough time.  So, yeah, we have a B-team of extra helpers.  You toss the little myths off to those people.  And they do a pretty good job.  All the cute ones, right?  Yeah, I wouldn't call it the little myths at all.  Well, I mean, it's just a question of the fact that the show's become really popular. 
[03:39:30]  Like you need the cool stuff for yourselves.  Well, if it blows up, I mean, these guys are going to be doing it.  If it involves fire, we're doing those.  No, not at all.  I mean, we definitely have our, we get the pick of the litter, I think.  But the second team or the B-team is just simply due to the fact that, you know,  the show is, we're not able to produce as much as the viewers want.  And actually, a couple of, two members of the B-team,  we've got Tori, who's been on since last season, and Carrie, 
[03:40:00]  who actually, Carrie's first day as Jamie's intern,  we scanned her butt for the airplane toilet myth.  And then we've just brought on Grant Imahara.  And both Tori and Grant are actually alumni of mine from Lucasfilm.  Really?  They both worked with me on the Star Wars films.  Grant is actually one of the three licensed R2-D2 operators.  Really?  Yeah.  That's a nice credit to have.  And one of the things, one of the geeks.  Oh, yeah.  I love that one.  One thing about this show that may not be evident is that, you know, 
[03:40:30]  and the need for the second team as part of this is that we actually know what we're doing  and we do all the work.  We don't like hire people to come in and set things up for us,  and then we show up and talk about it.  And that inherently is a very time-consuming process that it just makes it difficult  to crank out a whole lot of shows.  We're, as a rule, we're just covered with bruises.  Our hands are all cut up,  and we're probably among the hardest working people in TV right now. 
[03:41:00]  Well, we had a second cameraman come out to Mojave to help cover the shoot out there.  He was from California, and he'd done a lot of work on Fear Factor  and a lot of work on Trading Spaces on the Learning Channel with the carpenters and stuff.  And he said, at the end of the day, he says,  I've got to tell you guys, it's a real pleasure to work with you,  and you're the only hosts I've yet worked with who actually do their own work.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of them stand there when the camera's on, hold the hammer, and then...  I guess so.  I found that kind of appalling.  It was like the scales falling from my eyes.  And then you have Carrie.  Of course, you mentioned her. 
[03:41:30]  A lot of people writing in right now saying that she's very attractive.  We like Carrie.  And you seem to...  I'm just thinking you're trying to maybe get a few more viewers  that wouldn't normally stop on there.  But when you have her in a bikini being painted and then crying,  she comes off as an emotional wreck sometimes.  Why are you painting her in a bikini?  You know, it's funny.  We got a lot of...  I got a lot of angry fan mail when last season started with Carrie and Scotty,  both females working on the show. 
[03:42:00]  And people said,  Oh, you guys sold out.  You're going for the hottie thing.  It's total crap.  And my thing is,  well, you can't win.  I'm happy to show...  I'm happy to show women actually being able to use tools  and being competent in the shop.  I think that's a positive message,  not a negative message.  This is our...  We're almost done with our show music.  That's our two-minute one.  Wow, that went really quick.  I know.  That was crazy.  Well, we've got to thank you guys for coming by.  Jamie and Adam from Mythbusters.  On the Discovery Channel, what night?  Wednesday nights at 9 on Discovery. 
[03:42:30]  I only...  I'm going to start watching the show on a regular basis now.  That's great.  I watch it all the time.  It's like one of my favorite shows.  Absolutely.  Is there anything else we're promoting with you guys today?  I want to make sure you guys get your plugs out there.  Well, uh...  Just watch the show pretty much?  Just watch the show.  This Wednesday, there's one of our favorite episodes  that involves raising a sunken sailboat with ping pong balls.  Yeah.  That's definitely a high point for us.  Adam, I just wanted to ask you about the Star Wars with the models.  Obviously, a lot of CGI now.  Yeah.  Do you kind of look at that like,  eh, taking the easy way out? 
[03:43:00]  You know what?  I know.  I'll tell you,  a lot of those CGI models for the new Star Wars films  were built by ex-model maker friends of mine  who moved from the physical into the virtual.  And they still do fantastic work.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I always...  I really enjoy the models, I think, a little more.  Well...  So do we.  Yes.  Absolutely.  So do we.  I think it looks a lot better on film than the CGI.  Maybe in years to come,  it'll look as good on computer.  But I don't know.  I like the models.  It's all just another tool.  Yeah. 
[03:43:30]  Very good.  Guys, thanks for coming in, man.  Thank you.  I wish I had more questions.  You were asleep during the interview on The Lesbian Couch.  Rich Voss.  I'm so out of it.  All right.  I'm working too hard.  Really fast.  I want to thank Drew Boogie for doing the Gray Wolf remix today.  Anthony, also xratedshirts.com if you want one of those shirts  that Kenny's giving out outside right now.  RichVoss.com.  Thanks, Rich.  Ziggy's here from XM411.com and MyRadioStore.com.  Thank you for everything you did today.  And, of course, serious questions only for the schnitt show later on today. 
[03:44:00]  That's 1-800-801-8999.  It's going to be taking calls from our listeners today.  See you in Washington tomorrow.  Yes.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
