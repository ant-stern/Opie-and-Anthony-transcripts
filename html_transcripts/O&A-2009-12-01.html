<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts engaging in graphic sexual banter.  A caller, Richard, a Washington State police officer, reports that the suspect in the recent killing of four officers has been shot, possibly fatally, by Seattle PD. This news is juxtaposed with the media's focus on the Tiger Woods scandal. Richard provides details on the police response and potential accomplices.  The hosts then delve into speculation about Tiger Woods' injuries (a split lip) and his wife's alleged role in the accident, criticizing TMZ and Harvey Levin's reporting.  They speculate on a possible connection between the two recent Washington State police shootings and discuss a new attractive weather reporter on a New York news channel.  The veracity of Richard's report is questioned as other news outlets haven't confirmed it; conflicting information from other listeners follows.  Numerous tangents ensue, including discussions about James Gandolfini and paparazzi, the Florida mayor's reaction to the Tiger Woods scandal ("furious"), and the authenticity of reality TV shows like *Cheaters* and *Pawn Stars*.  A listener contradicts the initial Seattle police shooting report.  More sexually suggestive jokes follow, interspersed with a 911 call from the Tiger Woods accident, highlighting the neighbor's dramatic description.  The hosts speculate on a possible confrontation between Woods and his wife.  Another caller confirms the suspect in the police shooting was shot. The show ends with a renewed appreciation for *Pawn Stars* and the hosts' self-proclaimed status as breaking news reporters.

The show continues with a listener call segment heavily featuring discussions on the authenticity of reality TV shows (*Pawn Stars*, *Operation Repo*, *Cheaters*). A caller claims inside knowledge of *Cheaters*' fakery.  A significant portion focuses on *Hoarders*, with graphic descriptions of the squalor and filth within hoarders' homes, including dead animals. Callers share personal anecdotes about family members who hoard.  The hosts' commentary is filled with profanity and vulgar descriptions.  Thereâ€™s a discussion about Jesse Ventura's new show and President Obama's upcoming Afghanistan speech, with the hosts offering opinions and speculations.  The segment concludes with "Spectacular Suicide," a comedic radio serial, and a contest for comedy show tickets.  A recurring joke involves misgendering a caller with an ambiguous voice.

A debate on voting begins, sparked by a caller, Matt from D.C., criticizing comedians who comment on politics without voting. Co-host Jimmy defends his non-voting stance, while Anthony emphasizes the responsibility of public figures to participate in the system they criticize.  Anecdotes about past elections are shared, including Jimmy's vote for Ross Perot.  The draft is discussed, referencing Woody Allen's joke about being a draft "hostage," and comparing attitudes towards military service across different wars.  A caller, Mike from Westchester, highlights Israel's mandatory military service. Another caller shares frustrating experiences in the Iraq War. Jesse Ventura's views on war taxes and reinstating the draft are discussed, followed by 9/11 conspiracy theories based on Jesse Ventura interview clips.  Upcoming guests, Jesse Ventura and Ian Halpern, are mentioned. A murder mystery trivia contest is held, interrupted by reminiscing about former General Managers Ken Stevens and Scott Herman. Rush's absence from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and past Christmas parties are briefly discussed.  A news story about a man stealing a Salvation Army kettle is presented, leading to a discussion about "Happy Holidays" versus "Merry Christmas." The segment ends with humorous banter about the "Twelve Days of Christmas."

The segment begins with a discussion about the rising cost of Christmas, specifically the "Twelve Days of Christmas." This abruptly shifts to a promotional appearance by a monkey trainer for "Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian," with the hosts expressing amusement and disgust at the monkey's behavior.  They repeatedly joke about the monkey's potential for mischief and attempt to book it as a guest.  An audio clip of a woman queefing is played, with graphic descriptions and analysis from the hosts. A shorter audio clip of a man attempting a fart sound effect results in a microphone malfunction.  The show then discusses Derek Jeter being named Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, debating whether other Yankees deserved the award in the past 55 years.  They list various players and athletes, including Muhammad Ali, with humorous tangents and off-color jokes, including insults about Jim Abbott's disability.  Radiohead is briefly mentioned, followed by a discussion of Woody Allen's birthday and the anniversary of the first sex change operation, leading to crude jokes about surgical techniques.  Caller Footer discusses the surprising age of musician Dio. The segment ends with "Caller Bombs, Volume 2," playing back recordings of past callers' awkward or offensive statements, including discussions about Kim Kardashian, "Twilight," and the WWE.  The hosts react with laughter and ridicule.  The segment concludes with promotion for Jimmy's upcoming stand-up shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, devious.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horseshit.  This show is never short of characters.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Hi, I'm the O.P. and Anthony Virus.  And I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Hello, hello, hello.  Good morning.  Good morning.  We're going to go right to the phones.  I don't know if this is true.  We'll find out, though.  Richard in Washington.  What's up, Richard?  Good morning, boys.  How are you, Richard?  Hey, I'm a police officer in Washington State.  In an update for you guys, about 10 minutes ago, Seattle PD shot the suspect of the cop 
[00:01:30]  killing from yesterday.  Really?  But no one has this information yet.  Go to comotv.com.  You can listen to the Seattle PD police scanner.  Where was he when they shot him?  I'm sorry?  Where was he when they shot him?  They have a house around us currently.  They're still calling out suspects from the house.  As you know, they are...  The police over on the west side of the state are trying to get everybody that's involved 
[00:02:00]  with aiding and abetting this guy.  Yeah, apparently his family was kind of helping him out or something.  Yeah, he had a lot of friends that were trying to keep him underneath the road.  And, of course, we're talking about the guy that shot and killed the four cops.  Yes.  Fucking scumbag.  Savage.  And they thought they had him yesterday.  They had a house around.  It turned out to be false, right?  And now you're saying that the Seattle cops shot him 10 minutes ago.  10 to 15 minutes ago now, yes. 
[00:02:30]  They had a little showdown with him.  And the way it sounded on the airwaves is that he took one to the head  and they were transporting him by medics to the hospital.  Oops.  Oh, fantastic.  Oh, he must have poked his head out.  I hope he was saying, please, don't shoot me.  I surrender.  When they blasted his fucking stupid coconut off.  Hey, it met the world to me to hear you guys talking about it yesterday.  I love you guys very much.  Thank you for putting that out.  Oh, please.  Well, thanks for the update. 
[00:03:00]  I wait for CNN and the rest of the dumb networks to get off the Tiger Woods shit.  Yeah.  And maybe give an update on this story.  That's front page news.  Talk about something important.  It's the hooker.  I don't know if she's a hooker or not.  I shouldn't say that.  The girl who should be a hooker if she's not, who allegedly banged Tiger Woods.  Yeah.  She's on the front page of the Post.  And I think the Daily News, too.  Well, she's saying that she did not have an affair with Tiger Woods, just for the record.  She's denying it completely and saying that the sources that told the story are not credible and blah, blah, blah. 
[00:03:30]  So she's on the front page while there's a manhunt for a guy who shot, executed four cops.  Yeah.  Executed.  Guys, have you been given any kind of briefings up there about stuff?  Because, you know, with the first guy that shot a cop and then this guy, is there something going on?  Have they been talking behind the scenes like maybe there's something going on with Washington State? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  You know, any time there's something that goes on in the law enforcement world, as soon as those things break, you know, there's talk.  And after the last one, after the last officer was killed in Seattle, I mean, pretty much statewide we were having trainings about active shooter scenarios and shooting from vehicles.  And, you know, just whatever happens in that scenario, they want to run that by everybody to make sure that you're not just, oh, my God, that happened.  It's, oh, my God, what do I do when that happened to me? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  God, that's fucked, man.  All right, there you go.  I think we got an update.  We hope you're right.  Yeah.  We hope that's accurate.  That's great news that they shot and killed it.  I don't know what's great news.  Oh, one right in his fucking head.  Just goodbye.  Goodbye.  I would like to think this is true.  So we're becoming more reliable than the rest of the news networks.  First with your news, Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton.  All right, there.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Richard.  Later, Richard. 
[00:05:00]  Bye, guys.  Take care, man.  All right.  God, do I hope that is the fact.  Well, we'll have to wait and see.  I'm sure it would pop up pretty quickly, I think, on the news.  At this point?  Yeah, at this point.  Well, let's time it.  We had the news at 610.  Yeah.  We'll see what happens.  Watch it was already on every news channel at 40 minutes ago.  It was on the 5 a.m. news.  Danny's listening to the scanner.  What was they saying?  Anything?  Nothing yet.  Nothing yet?  Or anything?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Well, we were watching TV for the last hour, and they didn't have an update on this. 
[00:05:30]  They have the big booby monster doing the weather on 5.  We got a new local news station to check out every morning.  Gunners.  Yes.  Yes, we do.  With a big-titted monster.  I think they hired her.  I was thinking that maybe she was a replacement, but I think they hired her.  She's the new weather girl on Fox 5 locally here in New York City.  I was looking a little bloated this morning.  Oh, well, that's...  I was looking a little...  Yeah, that's the old one, though.  Yeah, it's old school now.  Here, turn that TV off. 
[00:06:00]  We got a new girl that you could go after, Ant.  A new big-titted monster.  You could go after.  Oh, there you go, though.  Tiger.  Still the golden boy.  It's on three TVs right now out of eight in studio.  Came out.  And the mayor of what?  Florida is what?  What were you saying just before the show, Jimmy?  Oh, it was...  Oh, boy.  This was good.  You have a love-hate relationship with the New York Post, because even though it's easy  to shit on it, which I'm about to do, I can't stop reading it. 
[00:06:30]  But the Florida mayor is apparently not happy with Tiger Woods, so it says, Florida mayor  is furious.  Furious.  F-O-R-E, exclamation point, E-S.  But that doesn't make sense on any level.  It makes no sense.  He's not furious.  He's furious.  Furious.  It's kind of like furious, but with a golf tie-in.  Right.  But what does that mean with the golf tie-in?  I don't know.  Furious.  You can't just tie it into a golf term. 
[00:07:00]  It has to still mean something.  What does furious mean?  I don't know.  He's supposed to be furious.  He's supposed to be furious, but since Tiger plays golf, he's the thing that Tiger yells  at his job.  How stupid.  What are they doing?  He's furious.  What does furious mean, though?  Fur basically means look out, obviously.  A ball might be coming your way.  So what does furious mean in that headline?  I have not read the article, but I'm sure he's angry about something. 
[00:07:30]  He's furious at Star Golfer.  He's furious at Tiger Woods for some reason.  And TMZ, I hope they're wrong about something.  I just want to see fucking Harvey Levin and TMZ get sued by somebody and lose a lot.  Why?  I very rarely root for lawsuits because I just don't like them.  I think that...  Harvey kind of likes us, though.  He doesn't like us, though.  He'd fucking...  He'd fuck us in a second.  And I hate a show where we stand there being the funny guy hanging over the wall and all 
[00:08:00]  these scumbag wannabe fucking actors who are now reporters because they can't cut into  the business.  Oh, they're all like, oh, joking around.  And he's like laughing and being...  Showing some jocularity.  Fucking bag of shit.  But he's...  But he always has his, like, Starbucks drink.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah, just a big beverage.  Sippy cup.  Yeah, he stinks.  You don't like Harvey in his sippy cup?  There's something predatory about it.  It's really irritating.  Yeah, I understand exactly what you mean.  I've watched that and been like, yeah, kind of...  I don't mind getting a story from a celebrity because, like, they are interesting, but the 
[00:08:30]  way they fucking hassle people, like, there's one of Seal and Heidi Klum just standing there  waiting for their car, and they just won't stop with questions.  It's like...  And you want to see Seal just punch someone's camera through their fucking teeth.  I want one of these actors to pull out a gun and shoot one of them, and I would fucking  keep it under my hat.  I wouldn't say anything.  Gandolfini would be the guy to do that.  Yes.  Oh, he doesn't like them at all.  And he's always one to just get right in their face. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, Brad Garrett, too, is another...  Brad Garrett.  He's had enough of those motherfuckers.  Oh, I know.  Holy shit.  A big doofy guy, and he'll just put a big meat fist in your face.  Good.  Let's make a list of celebrities that have had him at TMZ and the rest of them.  Apparently, he's a cantankerous guy.  I've met him a few times just because Romano comes with him sometimes in the cellar, and  he's always pleasant.  Ray?  What?  Yeah!  Yeah, Ray comes, but...  I met Brad.  Yeah, he's a friendly enough guy.  When What's-His-Name was doing the Oscar thing. 
[00:09:30]  Freaking I'm Mrs. Guy.  Why can't I think of his name right now?  Rob Bartlett?  Rob Bartlett.  Oh.  Rob Bartlett was in The Odd Couple.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  Okay, you're right.  And...  Oh, yeah.  He showed me around the set after a showing, and I got to meet Brad.  I wasn't with you when you saw that, was I?  No.  I did see that.  It was where you saw Matthew Broderick was there.  Wait, maybe you were there, too.  Yeah.  Where he was peeking out?  Because he knew me from Tough Crowd.  Well, he was peeking out at me, because Rob was saying, you know, Opie to Brad Garrett, 
[00:10:00]  and you know that he doesn't like us because of the Sarah Jessica Parker thing.  So he was peeking out from the side stage with a bike helmet on, like, gosh, should I go  over there and say something or not?  He wasn't peeking out like, really, Opie?  I got to say hi to him.  No, he just recognized the name as far as his wife goes.  Do you know...  How accurate do you think that was, that we would actually be the first people that 
[00:10:30]  would report...  Well, the fact that it was 45 minutes ago and nobody has gotten it.  And no one's on this.  Well, what will happen?  I'm just saying, I'm starting to doubt we have an exclusive...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I just am.  That's why we're talking about other stuff.  Maybe we'll see.  He sounds legit.  I know.  I would hope it would be.  But, you know...  Well, let's start Twittering.  Let's get in the Twitter universe.  I don't want...  An Opie and Anthony exclusive.  They have shot... 
[00:11:00]  They have shot the suspect.  False fucking info on something so important.  Wow, Gandolfini, it looks pissed at that guy.  Oh, yeah.  We played that on.  See that fucking animal face he makes?  He makes an animal face at that guy.  James Gandolfini versus paparazzi on YouTube.  All right.  You understand me?  Yeah.  Relax.  Relax.  I'm going to break you.  I'm going to get away from my gun.  I'm going to break your fucking face.  Break your fucking face.  Yeah, because this is just... 
[00:11:30]  That was Tony Soprano, by the way.  That was not James Gandolfini.  No, no, no, no.  The guys just won't stop following.  He's with his mother.  No.  There was one time he was weird with a fan at JFK, but I don't think the fan was just a  regular fan.  He was the guy waiting to break Gandolfini's balls or something, wasn't he?  Do you see the one where Gandolfini kind of hit the guy and then wound up taking a picture  with him?  Yeah, yeah.  But that guy was kind of weird.  He was like, how do I get to be Tony Soprano?  He kept asking these weird questions.  Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.  Ass. 
[00:12:00]  By the way, Anthony, nothing on Dead Cop Killer on CNN, USA Today, ABC News, et cetera,  et cetera.  Spectro in Michigan.  But we would be the guys.  Hey, why not?  Maybe it's time we're the guys.  You think it's time we're actually the guys?  Maybe it's time we're the guys.  Breaking news from Opie and Anthony.  Everyone is searching out the info that we got 15 minutes ago that they actually shot  the guy that killed those four cops.  I would love it if they did, but... 
[00:12:30]  Will we get credit?  No.  No?  No!  Whoever listens to this and picks it up, they get credit.  Oh, that would suck.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  The mayor should have said, teed off.  Yes, you're right.  Teed off.  Instead of for...  Oh, instead of for-ious.  For-ious.  Yeah, teed off would have been better.  For-for-for-ious.  For-for-ious.  For-for-ious.  You got it?  All right, good.  What was it?  Notorious?  Yeah.  By who? 
[00:13:00]  Duran Duran.  That was Duran Duran.  Duran Duran.  No, notorious.  We don't have any new info on the Tiger Woods thing, right?  Uh, no, he's not talking, and, uh, that's that.  And what are you hearing?  And who's your source?  My sources are, um...  What the hell are my sources?  Uh, uh, one of them, uh, nighttime bitches on the news.  Uh, you know, on, like, uh, Fox or CNN. 
[00:13:30]  Okay.  Which one is she?  Who's the one that just yells at everybody?  No, wait a minute!  She's crazy.  Oh, Campbell Brown.  No, no, Nancy Grace.  She stops people, she stops people, like, in the middle of the sentence.  And they're, they're, they're not hostile guests.  But she's like, wait a minute, Bill, wait a minute!  You're way out of line, Bill!  Now, what do you mean by that statement?  It's like, hey, you invited me here.  I just told you what I did for a living.  Get all nasty with me, you bitch!  My, I have a source, actually.  I'm actually, I'm actually friends with the suspect. 
[00:14:00]  And, uh, he's been texting me, so I don't know.  He said, the cops got me.  Oh, really?  I was hoping for a bigger laugh on that, as opposed to just a stare.  You might want to go somewhere else, then.  I deserve a little something.  If not a little laugh, maybe you could have got one of these.  Uh-huh.  There's 28 studios here, you might want to try another one.  I should pop my head into everyone and just try that joke.  Well, you wish one's like it.  We'd get an outstanding ovation in shade 45.  Nowhere else.  Here's the first report we're getting as, uh, uh, second to the one that, um, that we got. 
[00:14:30]  Seattle shooter in Bahamas.  Relaxing.  Police in Seattle say they have shot and possibly killed a man suspected of shooting dead four officers in a cafe in Washington State.  The Seattle home of Maurice Clemens had been, uh, surrounded by police hunting the suspect, uh, suspect the killer.  Acting on a tip-off, they sealed off part of the, the Lachie area of the city.  While armed SWAT team members ring the property, Mr. Clemens 37 has not been named as a formal suspect. 
[00:15:00]  And that's all they say.  But, um, where's the date on this?  I think that's all yesterday.  It's November 30th.  You asshole.  You know something?  Whoever sent me that link, click on this link, Anthony, click on this link.  Who did that?  You're getting bounced.  Oh, boy.  You're getting bounced.  That's not nice.  I'm bouncing you.  Oh, no.  Bouncing you.  I'll find you, too.  Because somebody, big capital, look at the fucking link. 
[00:15:30]  Dave's, eh, whatever your name is.  You're, you're so gone.  You're so gone.  Here we go.  Uh, someone.  Sorry, you, you get punished now.  Yes.  For giving me erroneous information and making me sound silly.  That's right.  I'm making Anthony sound like the dumb fuck.  Goodbye.  Uh.  Gone.  Ribs in bacon on, uh, on Twitter just sent me this saying,  Disregard BBC is already on the story. 
[00:16:00]  Check the BBC.  I did.  That was yesterday's story.  Wait, that's the same guy?  Dummy.  Bounce him.  Um, I can't.  Fuck you.  You're done.  Dave's an idiot.  All right.  Well, we both got fucked by the guy.  I'm still saying that, uh, that guy had good info.  Oh, are you?  Yeah.  Well, uh, wow.  Psycho Bob has some news for us from Baltimore.  I know, but I want to know about Nancy Grace and what you know about Tiger Woods. 
[00:16:30]  Uh, she had sources that heard statements that were made by Tiger Woods' wife.  There were statements made.  One statement was that, uh, she had, Tiger was about two houses away from his house when  he hit the, uh, the tree and shit.  What about the hydrant?  And the hydrant.  And, and the, uh, the, they were saying the wife then, Tiger's wife, runs out, she hears  two houses away that he's in an accident, runs out with a golf club to help him out of 
[00:17:00]  the car by busting both back windows out.  And then she changed the statement and said she, she hopped in one of their golf carts and  drove down the road to see what, uh, the hubbub was.  But again, with a golf club to smash out two back windows, to pull him out of the vehicle  to safety.  What?  What?  What?  Why?  She's a hero.  None of it makes sense.  And where's he going at two 30 in the morning? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Tiger Woods.  And Nancy Grace is gone.  I've said it as an attorney many times.  Nothing good happens after midnight.  Not in her house.  Oh, no.  Of course not.  I forget what it was.  It was on red eye last night.  They had a picture of, uh, the girl and they said the girl, uh, pictured here and they don't  know, and her attorney pictured here.  I think they showed a picture of a slug for Gloria already.  It was some creature they showed.  That's funny.  Or a worm.  It was something very funny. 
[00:18:00]  You never want to see that one.  No, Gloria.  Oh, she's the worst, dude.  Yeah.  She's not good.  Not good at all.  So, but what about the split lip?  You were telling me.  Yes.  And apparently he has a split lip.  Uh, and that was from a police officer that was on the scene.  Upper and lower?  Upper and lower.  Split lip.  Yeah.  That he sustained, uh, in the accident.  But then they were saying there was no blood in the vehicle on the steering wheel.  Nowhere. 
[00:18:30]  And it was an injury that would have a lot of blood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because it was a pretty good cut.  Yeah.  That has to be where the golf club impacted his face.  I'm saying, based on what we're hearing, I'm just saying, I think she smacked him in the face with a golf club.  Which is just amazing.  And then he leaves.  By the way, with no shoes on also.  Yeah, no shoes.  He just ran into that vehicle to get the fuck out of there.  He was in a panic.  He needed to flee. 
[00:19:00]  He was fleeing his house.  I wonder if she dropped the atomic bomb on him.  When they were yelling.  Oh.  Maybe, yeah, maybe that happened.  She started screaming.  Oh.  Don't you want to know what happened?  I have to know.  Why do we have to know, though, Jimmy?  Because he's a guy who we all like and have followed for a long time.  And he's a goody two-shoes. 
[00:19:30]  And he has a great, perfect image.  So it's nice to know that Mr. Goody Two-Shoes is a human like the rest of us.  It's a morbid curiosity with seeing somebody who's doing great kind of fall on their face a little bit.  It's natural to like to see that.  Yeah, because he, again, has been just like a golden boy.  No one's really messed with him.  So, yeah, we'll see.  And that's all we got.  I think the story will come out.  You think?  Sure.  Yeah, eventually.  Well, the alleged mistress is saying, look, man, nothing happened. 
[00:20:00]  I'm telling you right now, nothing happened.  Unless you're Hundley.  That mess.  You want to hear the 911 call with the neighbor?  Yeah, I got to hear it.  My favorite part, I just heard it this morning on the way in.  And I just love.  What happened?  This is part one and part two.  You'll bet.  We liked the Tiger Woods 911 call because in the background you hear the neighbor.  911 emergency? 
[00:20:30]  I need an ambulance immediately.  I have someone down in front of my house.  They hit a pole.  I came out to see.  Is it a car accident, sir?  Okay, sir.  Sir, is it a car accident?  Hello?  When you say it's Tiger Woods, of course.  I'd be like, hey, it's Tiger Woods.  Hello?  Yes.  Is it a car accident, sir?  It's a car accident, yes.  I need you, yes.  Okay, and are they trapped inside of the vehicle? 
[00:21:00]  No, they're laying on the ground.  Okay, stay on the line for medical.  Don't hang up, okay?  What is this about?  It's part two with the neighbor.  Yeah, yeah.  Listen to this.  What happened?  What's wrong?  I have my neighbor.  He hit the tree.  And we came out here just to see what was going on.  I see him and he's laying down.  I hit the tree.  You mean it was an auto accident?  Yes, there was an auto accident, yes.  Okay.  Is he outside or inside his car?  Your phone broke up. 
[00:21:30]  I heard inside.  You there?  Hello?  Liz, sir, are you there?  Yes.  Your phone broke up there.  Okay.  Can you repeat your phone number for me in case we...  ...the unconscious?  Yes.  Okay, are you able to tell if he's breathing?  No, I can't tell right now.  Okay.  All right, we do have help on the way.  What color is this car, too?  It's a black disc leg.  What happened?  What?  What happened?  That horrible voice.  I say goodnight to the river every night and good morning every morning. 
[00:22:00]  I'm in the middle of my Tai Chi.  Tai Chi?  What happened?  You couldn't tie the words.  Oh, God bless him.  Could you please hear her again?  I gotta hear that old...  Are you kidding me?  ...nosy old bat.  Get back in your fucking house, you useless, nosy old bat.  If we don't play as another ten times today, we're not doing our jobs.  What happened? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, I hate her.  She needs her hat removed.  I hope.  Right after she said that, she grabbed her chest and fell into the azaleas.  Face first into a juniper bush.  Oh, what happened?  I hope those were her last words on earth.  Bill.  Maybe Tiger Woods ran her over and she's just coming to.  What happened?  Or maybe she's the one he's having an affair with.  What happened? 
[00:23:00]  I love her.  She's the worst.  Back in the house, you're in the way.  I know, the old lady has no idea.  There's a white woman chasing a car thief.  She has no idea.  Go make the men some coffee.  Why?  What happened?  Why was he unconscious?  I think he was attacked while he was sleeping.  He fleed the house and he was very woozy from whatever the... 
[00:23:30]  Also, he's on some kind of, allegedly on some kind of pain medication.  They said.  Maybe a little something.  Yeah, all right.  Pain medication.  Maybe because the pain medication was maybe a sleeping pill so he could sleep and next  thing you know, his wife's freaking attacking him.  You put everything together.  Yeah, you put everything together.  And then he runs out all freaking woozy because he's still on the pill that he took because  he assumed that everything was cool at home, and now he can't drive his car because he  realizes he's half asleep still.  Oh, where? 
[00:24:00]  Where?  What happened?  I hate her.  She just...  Oh, that's no...  See, I can picture what she looks like.  She came out out of a clock open, and she came out and said that and went back inside  the clock.  She's fucking terrible.  I just see her in a horrible bathrobe, clutching it by the neck.  What happened?  Like her hair in curlers. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Oh, she's atrocious.  Bill?  Bill?  Bill?  Oh, God love him.  Tiger, it was terrible.  He hit a tree in a fire hydrant.  You're kidding!  It's a black escalade.  Tiger, what happened?  Day late, a dollar short, bitch.  I know!  Just back off.  Back in the house, Burton. 
[00:25:00]  Let the brother make a call.  Holy shit.  What happened?  She's probably standing in the middle of dog duty as she says that.  Yeah, her own.  Yeah, she's clutching a robe, like, with one hand, and she's got, like, a little Yorkie  in her other hand.  Yep, yep.  What happened?  And she's probably wearing one of those old...  You know those old lady hats?  They look like sea mines.  They wear these old hats, and they have, like, the little fucking... 
[00:25:30]  Sea mines!  You know what kind of hats I mean?  Yes, I do.  She's got little nubs on them.  She's got those nubs on them.  Oh, you guys.  Eric on Long Island's got it.  She was saying that in response to seeing a lovely blonde married to a shwuggie.  What happened to our country?  She was yelling at Ellen's parents.  One more time.  The black disc leg.  What happened? 
[00:26:00]  Someone's suggesting she wheeled up on her little rascal or her hover-round.  What happened?  You're old and a burden, and your family hates you.  Exactly.  Time did.  James S. from the London, UK.  Fox 5 just said, developing story, that killer is still on the loose.  Oh, really?  I don't know what the fuck...  Whoops.  That guy better call back.  If he got us, then, you know, you gotta tell us.  He's like the Terminator.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston. 
[00:26:30]  Jared, we're...  I was just golfing with him.  Give my condolences to the kids.  That's old school, Jared.  Good job.  Oh, she's the best.  They're wondering if that old lady has a dog named Chester.  Oh, yeah.  Could be.  It's old Chester.  He should have made three rights.  Yeah, and the latest news on Tiger, too.  Yes, he pulled out of his own golf tournament, saying, because of the injuries from the car 
[00:27:00]  accident.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He has no desire to show his face in public anytime soon, especially if he's got a fine  split lip or something.  Oh, yeah.  A nice split lip from a golf club.  It's a black disc leg.  What happened?  Is anyone able to open the door?  We're trying to figure out right now.  Okay.  While I have time to get on the way, I'm just going to stay on the phone with you.  I'm into my neighborhood. 
[00:27:30]  Two Negroes.  What happened?  Let's say hi to Pat in Minnesota.  Pat.  Pat.  Good morning, Pat.  Good morning, Ann.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Good morning, Pat.  So, I don't necessarily know if it'd be the pain medication.  How do you know he's not laying there sleeping and she's giving him a couple whacks to the  head with the golf club?  That's going to make him a little unconscious.  Might have been. 
[00:28:00]  Maybe she saw a text.  See.  Maybe something, you know, and he's asleep and she whacks him and he's just like, holy  fuck, I got to get out of here.  Feets don't fail me now.  Barefoot runs out to the escalade.  If he's barefoot, that means he wasn't awake.  Left in haste.  He wasn't awake.  Oh.  You know, the thing about Tiger, he loves his privacy.  Yes.  And because he's not talking, the whole world is talking about this. 
[00:28:30]  He's got to say something.  He really does.  That's what some of these panel people were saying last night.  They said, like, you know, someone like Letterman got in front of it and pretty much diffused  it, but, you know, Letterman's able to use comedy, which he did, especially on the first  day he brought it up.  But, uh, Tiger, you know, not known for his comedic skills.  Right.  You know what, though?  It's the end of the golf season.  Yeah.  Doesn't have to play anytime soon.  So you freaking come out with something and now you go hide until the golf season starts  up. 
[00:29:00]  He's got a yacht.  He could, too.  He doesn't want...  Jump on your yacht and hang out.  He does not want a picture of him with that lip split open.  Oh, they just showed her.  Who?  Uh, the one with her legs spread apart on the stairs.  That one picture of her?  She's, she's, she's all right.  She's skanky.  I like it.  She's all right.  There's a reason why she's wearing those sunglasses in every picture.  Oh, really?  Ah.  Really?  Ah.  She's all right.  Oh.  The alleged mistress? 
[00:29:30]  Ah, dude, she's fantastic.  There's another picture of her in the Daily News.  Which one?  Oh, jeez.  Let me see a new picture.  She's a sexy fucking girl, man.  The one with the lips?  Dude, she's showing off.  She's sexy.  She's showing off her lips.  That one's hot.  The one with the legs?  No, the one with the legs, you can't, you can't die.  She's a beautiful girl, man.  That's ridiculous.  I'd fuck her dogs just because they probably licked her pussy washers to sleep once.  What happens?  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  Rebecca in Queens.  Rebecca.  Rebecca.  Hey, good morning.  How are you?  Good.  I'm a little scared. 
[00:30:00]  That neighbor of Tiger Woods sounds like Anthony's ex-mother-in-law.  Yes!  Um, it was just breaking news on Channel 2.  The Seattle cop killer dude.  Did they shoot him?  I don't know.  It was quick breaking news, and of course then they had to go to traffic and weather.  So I was just walking in throughout breaking news, Seattle, surrounding house.  But it's definitely this morning, not November 30th.  Really?  So that guy, uh, might have gave us a little scoop.  And now I can't leave for work until I see this.  Because I'm hooked on this breaking news.  All right, cool. 
[00:30:30]  Now we're going to have to...  Thank you, Rebecca.  Have a lovely day.  Oh, certainly will.  Thank you.  This fucking weather girl is ridiculous.  Oh, there she is again.  Look at those fucking hands.  Somebody gave me some intel on her.  Oh, yeah?  I think she's from Detroit.  Her name's Shay Ryan.  She's no kid.  She's no kid, but...  Yeah.  She's got some set of tits.  Exactly.  And the thing is, she's got a very slim waist.  Slim waist.  So the big tits kind of...  Real big boobies.  Chikung, chikung.  They don't look like implants.  No, no. 
[00:31:00]  She's got to turn around and show that ass.  The ass looks a little flat.  Does it?  Yeah, she's got a flat ass.  I can't tell.  She hasn't turned around.  She's in a little squeak.  There's a reason she's not turning around, because she's got the flat ass.  Well, well...  I can't tell.  She's just not turning enough.  Because she knows how to work it.  Yeah.  To make you wonder.  She knows everyone's just looking at those tits.  Right.  God, is she a distraction.  She is.  That's all we can talk about. 
[00:31:30]  She's got a nice black number on today.  Let's see.  Let's go to Dave in Connecticut.  Dave.  Hey, how's it going?  Hi.  Hey, my theory is, if he was on Ambien, if he fell asleep, he could admit stuff without  even knowing it, and next thing you know, you're in a conversation that you have no idea  how it got there.  He could admit it having an affair, and wham, golf club to the face. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, really?  We could speculate on anything.  Yeah.  All right.  I've seen it happen, and I've had my own personal experience with it.  It's a hell of a way to wake up.  Well, right on.  Thank you, Dave.  Let's see.  Now, here's a story.  Lakewood Police shooting suspect shot by police in South Seattle early this morning, and this  is this morning.  Maurice Clemens was shot and wounded in South Seattle and has been taken to the Harborview 
[00:32:30]  Medical Center, according to law enforcement sources.  Clemens was standing outside in the 440 block or something like that, of South Kenyon Street  when he was confronted by officers.  The source said he challenged the officers and was shot around 2.40 a.m.  Now, would that be local?  That'd be 5.40.  And we had this story just after 6.  His condition was not immediately known. 
[00:33:00]  Clemens has been the focus of the thing.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Well, his condition is not immediately known if he's shot in the head.  That's good.  He confronts police.  He could have confronted the police by saying, excuse me, officers, what would you like from  me?  And that's a confrontation worthy of a bullet to the head if you're one of those cops.  You know they just wanted to shoot that son of a bitch.  Oh, I certainly hope.  Another story coming out?  I'm telling you, people listen to this show for news. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, this one's loading.  It just says hunt for killer.  Wow.  So, well, I want to thank our fine, faithful listener for giving us a big scoop there.  Time-wise, it works out.  Absolutely.  You know, 2.40 a.m.  That's our time, so.  Oh, wait, wait.  2.40 is their time, which means 5.40 our time, right.  Yeah.  Drudge Report.  Drudge Report.  Drudge Report.  UN digs in on climate fraud. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I saw.  Ken?  This is KiroTV.com, which is a local Seattle website, slash TV.  They say that Kiro 7 has confirmed that Maurice Clemens is dead.  Yay.  Oh, confirmed.  That's what they say.  Dead.  Cops shot him in the head.  Dead.  Dead.  And we brought it to you first.  Wow.  Open Anthony exclusive.  Thank you to the caller.  Yes, thank you.  Happy you were correct. 
[00:34:30]  And what does that mean for us?  We're a legitimate news source officially.  We're a legitimate news outlet.  Get Derek with a sweeper.  Tell him to stop obsessing about Lionsgate and get us a fucking sweeper.  Exactly.  That we're a legitimate news source now.  You know that Jake Gyllenhaal movie that's coming out?  Brothers.  It's Lionsgate.  I saw Lionsgate and I'm like, I'm not seeing that piece of shit.  Why?  Just because D-Boy?  D-Boy's Lionsgate.  D-Boy said.  Why would I see that?  Well, somebody I know wants to see it. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, who?  Just a chick I know.  Oh, really?  D-  Why?  I got a text last night that was like, oh, you want to see that movie?  And I'm like, eh, not really.  I don't go to the movies.  Only because her movie tastes stinks.  Oh, really?  Don't all girlfriends' movies taste stink?  I want to see this one.  Why?  It looks fucking horrible.  What movie did she want to see?  Well, the Jake Gyllenhaal movie.  No, what was the last movie she really wanted to see? 
[00:35:30]  I don't remember.  It was some horror movie she recommended that I wanted to buy the DVD just to fucking break  it on her forehead.  It was horrid.  I'm like, this is not scary.  It was terrible.  Good to know everything's going well in your private life.  It is, actually, but it's just, first of all, these eggs are atrocious.  You were right.  I gave up on those eggs fucking months ago.  What, are these fucking ostrich eggs?  How about some real eggs, Kenny?  How do you ruin eggs?  I don't know.  They're rubbery or something.  They're shoe leather, yes.  They're fucking rubbery, these eggs.  I don't know.  It's fucking Manhattan. 
[00:36:00]  I think the intern licks them.  All right.  We want to take our first break.  We're going to get into some Jesse Ventura.  I'll tell you everything that's...  Shut up.  He was on Larry King last night.  He's going to be on our show tomorrow.  You'll be amazed by what you don't know.  Jesse will be on the show tomorrow.  Mind control.  We love when Jesse Ventura stops by.  Save it for after the break, Ant.  Ant's got a lot to say about Jesse Ventura.  Because I watch that channel all the time, and they advertise his show non-stop. 
[00:36:30]  It's not conspiracy.  Conspiracy.  Thermite paint.  Shut up.  Also, maybe you didn't stay up late enough to know, but the fucking Pats got their ass kicked.  You're kidding.  What happened?  Monday Night Football.  Saints beat the Pats 38-17.  Drew Brees, five TDs.  Saints still undefeated, 11-0.  Damn, yo.  So, there you go on that.  Quick break, and we'll get into the Jesse Ventura on Larry King and other things. 
[00:37:00]  Hoping Anthony.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is the wrong Bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Bill died today.  Yeah, kid.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Who is this? 
[00:37:30]  It's John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Where did it happen?  This afternoon.  Where?  Yeah.  On the highway.  Oh, God.  Love him.  Yeah.  Big, big, big pile up. 
[00:38:00]  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  Well, I got to go.  All right, John.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Hey, really quick.  For my hockey fans out there, I just retweeted something on my Twitter, OP Radio.  An amazing play that happened last night.  Goalie pretty much gets his ear hacked right off by his own player. 
[00:38:30]  I just showed you guys the clip.  Pretty cool, right?  You're not a hockey fan for the most part.  You know, you can appreciate that.  Oh, hell yeah.  What happened there?  It looked like the guy got pissed and wanted to smash the top of the net with his stick.  Right.  And instead wound up hitting his own goalie in the ear.  The left ear, and it was just bleeding horribly.  Which almost took his ear off.  Thomas, uh...  Tomas. 
[00:39:00]  Tomas Volkorn.  Suffers bizarre injury in Panthers game.  You're kidding.  I got the video clip on my Twitter, OP Radio.  What happened?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ater.  Also, on the way in, the spectacular suicide.  Suicide.  Episode 2.  Oh, no.  Episode 1 was great.  Well, it certainly was.  I hope the sequel can hold up.  Usually doesn't, right?  Uh, no.  Let's get into Jesse Ventura.  He was on Larry King. 
[00:39:30]  Jesse.  Jesse Ventura has a new show on, uh, True TV.  You love True TV.  I watch a lot of True TV.  Although you brought it to our attention that a lot of that True TV is not too true.  Their original programming sucks a big dick.  Used to be Court TV, right?  Yeah, used to be Court TV.  And then, uh, they did this True TV thing now.  And a lot of it was, uh, you know, just police chase shows and shit like that.  I love those.  Forensic files.  Just any of those true shows where, you know, you've led through a case from the beginning 
[00:40:00]  to the end.  And you see, at the beginning, you've got to go, oh, he's guilty.  Oh, he did it.  And then, you know, you realize how stupid you are and how you would put an innocent  man in jail.  Forever.  Yeah.  And, uh, then they started coming up with original programming.  The first of which, I believe, was that stupid repo show.  That's a good show.  It's horrendous.  Shut it.  I don't even want to play today, Timmy.  That show is horrendous.  People thought at first that it was real. 
[00:40:30]  And it's so obvious that it's fake.  It's staged.  They're actors.  Is it as fake as Cheaters?  It's, uh...  Cheaters is fake?  Oh, my God.  Dude, it's Cheaters is fake.  It's the fakest show on television.  They hire really good actors and not really good.  I mean, actors and actresses.  Cheaters is fake.  I had a driver tell me that one time because he used to work on it.  But I don't know.  Some of them are just too real. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, it seems very fake to me.  Cheaters?  Yeah.  I don't watch the show.  I've watched it once.  I've watched it a couple times.  I was like, that seems really fake.  But that other show is just horrible.  Then there's Pawn Stars, which is the pawn shop one.  Wait, Sam was watching that last night.  That one isn't really that bad because it's almost like...  What's that one about?  It's almost like the antique road show at a porn shop.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  So you get people...  Porn.  Porn.  Pawn shop.  Well, that's what they're gold for, so it's okay. 
[00:41:30]  They get people to come in with this shit.  And the guys at the pawn shop try to give them as little as possible for it.  And the guy talks up what it is.  It's like, oh, this is a medieval mace.  And the guy looks and says, dude, it's stamped, you know, made in fucking Japan.  Right, right.  19 fucking 68.  Right.  Get out of my store.  Any cool stuff, though?  Yeah, sometimes it's pretty cool stuff.  But the pawn guy is not going to tell you it's...  No, the pawn guy is very sharp and always giving him a lower price than he really likes. 
[00:42:00]  And then what?  How does the show work?  After these dummies leave the pawn shop, then the pawn shop guy goes, huh, huh, huh, look  what I got.  Yeah, sometimes they look it up.  They figure out what it is.  But it is more like...  It's kind of like an antique road show thing.  You know, they get the people talking about their thing, what they think it's worth.  Do you like antique road show?  How much do you want from it?  No, no, but it used to, you know.  I like it.  Occasionally, in the old days, I used to turn it on and go, I don't like it.  Because, I mean, you learn about...  Interesting.  You learn about stuff.  It's an old game.  What's that worth?  I always... 
[00:42:30]  But, of course, I love when, you know, on an antique road show, the person thinks they  have something.  Yeah.  See, most people out there love when some idiot had no clue that their fucking chair is worth,  you know, $100,000.  Yeah.  I like when it works the other way, where these people are high and mighty, like, look  what I got from the Revolutionary War.  It's been in my family for years.  They have this whole story.  My grandfather passed it down to...  And the guy goes, yeah.  It's worth $18. 
[00:43:00]  I howl at home.  These are very common.  And meanwhile, you painted it.  Or someone painted it.  Oh, that's even better.  Yeah.  They go, well, if you didn't paint it, you idiot, this would be worth $20,000.  But because you painted it, it's worth $72.50.  There's a couple instances of that on Pawn Stars.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I've been digging the show, too.  And some guy brought in some pewter chess set that, like, and he's saying, oh, my brother  brought it over from England.  It's the whole piece.  And the guy's like, well, he looks at it for two seconds.  He goes, well, it's not, like, old. 
[00:43:30]  It's fairly new.  He's like, how much did your brother pay for it?  And he goes, like, $2,500.  He goes, well, what do you think it's worth?  He goes, I don't know.  Probably it's weight and pewter.  You know?  Whatever tin is worth these days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever pewter's worth.  And then another guy.  Oh, man.  Should he get ripped off?  Yeah, big time.  And then another guy had the first year that they put out the cold revolver.  Yeah.  And the idiot, instead of leaving it the way it was, he cleaned it with a wire brush.  Oh, no.  I love that.  You never do that to, like, antique.  Why was that bad? 
[00:44:00]  Because apparently collectors like to have it in its original condition.  And even if there's, like, rust on this particular piece, it's part of its original.  It's, you know, it's not maintained.  It was never restored its original.  I think they call it a patina.  And if you clean it off, it just destroys the value.  The value's gone.  And so this guy, he wanted to make it look all nice for the pawn shop, so he cleaned  it with a wire brush.  That'd bring to the ass all.  Collectors are a pain in the ass.  They've got to keep it in their original packaging and all that. 
[00:44:30]  Let's say hi to Vinny.  A couple people saying this, though.  Go ahead, Vinny.  You're talking for a lot of people today.  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, Vinny.  Just wanted to let you know that Cheaters, you can check it out on YouTube, the host got  stabbed in one episode.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm aware of that.  I think if Cheaters was real, I mean, that sounds like it's real if the guy's getting  stabbed.  But I think Cheaters went fake after the guy got stabbed.  Oh, really?  He got stabbed?  At the very least.  What about when on that stupid repo show last season, the big cliffhanger, when the big 
[00:45:00]  fat guy apparently had a heart attack there during one of the repos?  Oh, really?  And then there were some people I was reading on these message boards going, how could they  leave it hanging like that with us not knowing what happened to Big Lou or whatever his name  is?  And then people would just lambast in this bitch like, are you insane?  It's a fake show.  It's fake.  They're actors.  The fights are fake. 
[00:45:30]  No one ever really gets punched.  They leave.  They drive away with the car and the cameraman is still standing there taping the fucking  people whose car it was.  Right.  And then all of a sudden they're back in the car again talking to the people.  Stop it.  I don't think Cheaters had that kind of camera stuff.  I know what you mean.  Yeah.  I think Cheaters had the type of camera work you should have if you're filming a live  event.  I saw Cheaters recently.  I mean, it's fake.  I'm telling you.  I don't have a great example right now. 
[00:46:00]  And also these goddamn club shows.  The show where they get the fucking camera in like, what was the name of that club at  the Hard Rock?  I know.  What?  Club Marmalade?  No, it was not Club Marmalade.  Rehab.  Club Rehab, it's called.  It was called.  I don't even know.  I haven't seen commercials for it in a while. 
[00:46:30]  But it's just more fake phoniness.  And now they got that new one with the biker bar.  And they have nine days to make enough money to stay in business.  And the guy's like, I don't know if we can do this.  If it rains, we're screwed.  And I have no vested interest in this place.  But they made the money by doing the TV show.  Yeah, whatever.  They would probably use the money they got from doing the TV show to keep the bar open.  To keep the bar open.  Plus the fact that now that it's on TV, the place is going to do very well. 
[00:47:00]  And I don't think the bar was in trouble anyway.  And it's one of those shows where it's just fake drama between the boss and the waitresses.  Like, he's always yelling at them.  And the hot chicks.  And dopey guys.  And just all over-the-top shit.  Fights.  You know what?  You've got to blame the lawyers.  Lawyers got their fucking mitts in reality programming as well.  Because reality programs used to be pretty damn good.  But how interesting would it be, really, if someone goes, we need to do a show. 
[00:47:30]  How about this?  Let's find a bar that has less than 10 days to go before bankruptcy.  That's a hit waiting to happen.  It's fantastic.  Who cares?  And the way it is, they present it like, wow, this guy needs to make this money or the bar folds.  And I'm like, I do not care one bit if this guy loses his bar, loses his life.  I could give a fuck.  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even watch it. 
[00:48:00]  Like I said, it's all about forensic files, 48 hours.  All those, I'm crazy on legal shows.  Yeah, what do you have?  Does Mick Foley have a fucking dildo throwing show that he tosses them like javelins?  I was hoping you were going to start talking about Pawn Stars again.  Oh, is it a good show?  It's one of the best shows on television.  All right, slow down.  It's a great show.  I've seen one of the best shows on television.  Season two started last night.  I didn't see the season premiere because wrestling was on. 
[00:48:30]  I didn't either.  How did you end up on the History Channel?  I just watched Pawn Stars on the History Channel.  Oh, is that it?  It's not one of Sam's regular shows.  No, it's definitely not.  But I saw Pawn Stars.  Pawn Shops have always been interesting to me.  Oh, really?  So I started watching it.  And it really is a good show.  But the best part is when he has a friend.  Like he's like, I'm going to call my buddy who knows about this.  Yeah, he always has a friend.  He has friends who know about everything.  That's true.  Like someone will come in with a battle axe.  Yeah.  And they'll be like, yeah, I got a buddy that knows about battle axes. 
[00:49:00]  He says, yesterday he called his friend who restores airplanes.  Oh, really?  Because he bought an airplane from somebody.  An airplane.  And I was like, where did you meet this guy?  That's so stupid.  And then the guy comes down and looks at him and goes, that's an airplane.  Yeah, well, he also, like, half the time the experts, like, the guy will come in and will be like, I want $200 for this.  And the guy who owns the pawn shop will be like, oh, well, we have to call the expert.  And the expert will come in and say, yeah, it's probably worth about $3,000.  And the guy who's selling it goes, whoa. 
[00:49:30]  And then the guy behind the counter, he'll just go, yeah, I mean, that's what he says.  But it's really not worth it to me.  I'll give you the $300.  That's what he says.  He goes, well, you know, maybe to a collective, you want to go out and try to sell it.  So, to me, right now, it's worth this much.  He rips people off.  Yeah, but you know what?  A lot of the time he gets it because these people, they're in a pawn shop.  Yeah, it's great though.  And then they walk out of there and they go, well, you know, I was kind of hoping to get, you know, $1,000.  But, you know, hey, you know what?  I walked out of here with $400 more than I had walking in.  So, right. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  And then he sells the item for the exact amount that the expert said.  Exactly, yeah.  He'll sell it for $3,000.  What a scumbag.  I got to see the show.  He said last night, he bought this map.  This guy said he wanted $550 for this map from the 1700s because it said $550 on the back of it.  And so he calls in this expert who said it was worth like $2,000.  Oh.  And the expert leaves and the pawn shop owner goes, I'll give you the $550.  And the guy goes, okay.  And then the pawn shop guy says, I'll call my collector friend. 
[00:50:30]  They'll come down and buy it.  It's a real quick sale.  The guy turns it around.  Makes a lot of money.  There's this other guy who was trying to sell his old gun.  He bought a gun for $2,000, like a Civil War era gun or something.  And his wife was really pissed at him for buying it.  So he went to sell it.  And then they told him, they had the expert come in and they were like, no, this is a complete fake.  This is not worth anything near $2,000.  And the guy just started screaming profanities as he left the store.  He was talking about. 
[00:51:00]  Very angry.  What trouble he would be in with his wife now.  Because he couldn't sell it.  So they have to probably tell them the real value.  That's probably one of the stipulations you're doing the show.  Like, you have to let these people know what this shit's worth.  You can't just rip them off like that.  Well, that's probably the lawyers.  I keep going to the lawyers.  Why would you have to tell the people?  Unless the lawyer's like, well, this is a potential lawsuit if you don't tell them the actual cost of this.  This is gun guy.  This is great.  To the period, anywhere between $1,500 and $2,500. 
[00:51:30]  To kind of give you an idea of the standards of condition, you would expect to see all the metal heavily pitted.  This one, you can tell what the markings are.  There's no apparent major pitting or damage or deterioration to the metal.  So I would classify this as a very good defined condition.  Unfortunately, just right off the bat, I know that this is, unfortunately, a reproduction. 
[00:52:00]  Okay, so how can you tell?  First of all, the markings were, you know, punched in as opposed to hand engraved.  The crown over GR mark is for King George III, which is correct for the period guns.  However, it's a bit different in style.  It's not hand engraved.  You would have certain markings on the barrel that were proof marks from the Tower of London.  There is just nothing about this gun that is of the period.  You're sure?  100% positive. 
[00:52:30]  It looks the period, and it looks like it has age, but it's all artificial.  So, okay, so how much is this thing worth?  Um, it's value would be about $75 to $100.  Oh, oh.  You know, I paid 800 bucks for this.  I'm sorry you got burned.  Yeah, so, okay, maybe the thing is a fake.  I'm...  Yeah, man, unfortunately, this happens a lot. 
[00:53:00]  I mean, you gotta have something saying that it's real.  I feel bad for the guy.  I mean, I wouldn't want to lose that kind of money either.  But, I mean, he should have got the paperwork.  Sorry.  Oh, boy.  Go shoot yourself with it.  You're really gonna kill me.  That is fucking white.  He's just cursing.  Walking down the sidewalk cursing.  He's holding the gun, like, by the barrel.  He's all fucking hot under the fat collar.  Dumb fatso.  That is great.  But that's how you would react if you found that shit out. 
[00:53:30]  Fuck.  Fuck, I gotta watch this show.  What am I doing watching Cake Boss?  I need to watch Pawn Show.  Cake Boss?  Because you know that guy's wife probably fucking scolded him.  And he's like, you don't understand.  You don't understand.  And he's like, goddammit, she did understand.  I'm gonna take that.  He just wants his one hobby.  Yeah.  This is his one hobby.  And it is a waste of time.  You sell that fucking gun right now.  You get your money back.  And you go...  He probably looked for the right...  See, it's got the GR.  He really thought he knew what he was doing.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:54:00]  And he's been made a fool of on television.  Some shyster was selling it to him going, see, it's got the original markings, Tower of  London.  This is great.  They're so happy.  Oh, look at that.  And then when they actually buy old guns, they go and test them out to see if they still  work.  So they start firing guns and stuff.  Yeah, yeah, I've seen.  That's good.  But how do they do that if they want the original condition?  Is that...  There's no fucking...  Well, because it's also...  Guns are worth a lot more money if they still fire.  Oh.  So if they can guarantee that they still...  We got leased in Connecticut.  I'm a little suspicious.  I don't want to rain on everyone's fucking parade here, but it's the acting with the 
[00:54:30]  guy in the yellow shirt.  He was a psychopath.  He wasn't acting.  He was a damaged person.  I mean, when he was outside the store cursing, that was very believable.  Inside, I don't know, it seemed like there was a little acting going on there.  He's just a weirdo.  Maybe because the cameras were on or something.  Or maybe because...  You never know.  I was a little suspicious of his acting there.  You never know if what he gave was a real moment.  Like, he may have said, God, they don't have...  They said, could you say that again?  Yeah.  Like, they may go back and redo stuff that is real, but these guys don't know how to  act for her.  That's a good point, too. 
[00:55:00]  Let's go to Lisa in Connecticut.  Read the disclaimers.  Lisa!  Hello!  Hello!  Oh, my God!  Good morning!  Hi!  You sound very excited to be on our show, Lisa.  That's the reaction she should have.  Yes.  You know what?  I'm probably one of the only women that listens to you every morning.  I love you guys.  All right.  You'd be surprised how many women we have.  We have.  We've had three women callers already today before you, Lisa.  That's right.  Okay.  What do you have on Pawn Shop?  I have to tell you, it's absolutely fake. 
[00:55:30]  No, it's not.  My cousin is an antique dealer in California.  They called him up.  They asked him what he had.  He told him he deals in antique, like, colonial currency, stuff like that.  And then they had one of those things where they call him up and say, oh, let's see what  so-and-so has to say.  And then they had to go on the shelf.  It's totally fake.  He's an expert.  Of course they-  They scouted.  Of course they got real experts.  Yeah.  The people selling them are real. 
[00:56:00]  Not the ex-  We don't think that they're really friends.  Hold on.  She has a point.  Wait.  What are you saying, miss?  Oh, jeez.  They set it up ahead of time.  Yep.  It's so private.  They make sure everything is-  They call this guy because they know he already has it.  Right.  They have someone bring it in.  Anyway, it's all fake, but it's really-  Yeah, but it does seem real, right?  Because Sam is convinced that it's real, but they do set it up, right?  He is an asshole.  They set it up with real stuff. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  It's all like-  All right, Lisa.  I figured.  All right.  Thanks, Lisa.  Thank you.  There goes Lisa.  Let's go to Gennaro and Quorum.  Gennaro.  Gennaro?  I'm going to make his mother wish she never had him.  Gennaro?  Anything else?  Yeah.  Sorry.  Have you heard that before?  Only a couple times.  And, of course, he changed your name from McClain.  Oh, my God.  Every time I call with that joke-  I know.  I don't know that one.  I just saw Die Hard the other day.  I don't know that one. 
[00:57:00]  Hey, he goes to put in fucking, you know, his last name to find her.  And then he puts Gennaro in, and he gets pissed off that she's using her fucking maiden name.  And then the guy at the desk just goes, oh, yeah, the party.  It's the only people that are here.  30th floor.  It's like, hey, asshole, why'd you make me go through this stupid computer thing if everybody's  up on the 30th floor?  He ain't pretty no more.  I wanted to bring back up the repo show and how ridiculous that show is. 
[00:57:30]  There was this one episode where the big, bald guy, the big, tough guy with the mustache,  he gets hit by a taser, and he actually pisses himself.  He pissed himself for the acting of the show.  Now, I've been hit by this, the MX-26.  I got hit with it when I was in the Marine Corps when we were doing SOTG training.  That thing doesn't make you fucking piss yourself.  So this guy really pissed himself to try to make this show, I guess, look, you know, 
[00:58:00]  a little bit more real.  Yeah.  Blue Heeler, thank you.  He writes assisted reality.  That's what we're talking about here today.  But repo isn't assisted reality.  It is completely fake.  Completely fake.  They base the stories on stories from repos.  Right.  But they're so over the top and so phony, and it's ridiculous.  It's a shame because the concept to all these shows sound great, but I got to tell you,  it's got to be the lawyers going, look, we can't take chances. 
[00:58:30]  I don't.  One more thing.  What?  Why not, Ann?  Why wouldn't you, if you're doing a repo show, really, those guys that actually get  those fucking cars, you get cameras going, like you used to do with the old cop show,  you would get some good shit going on.  Not enough exciting shit happens during a repo.  Not a lot of confrontation, right?  Yeah.  Every fucking thing they go on, there's huge confrontation and fist fights.  Most repos, it's in the middle of the night, and no one's driving his forklift through 
[00:59:00]  a car so they can't take it.  It's such bullshit.  It's daylight.  It's like, who's going to watch a show where some guy, Jimmy's a fucking lock, starts a  car up and goes, well, there we go, I got one.  Yeah, there's still sleeping inside.  Because that's 99.9% of fucking repos.  That's a good point.  Cops is a real show.  Cops is a real show.  That's a good show.  Love Cops.  And if you want to know if the porn, what is it, porn stars, if you want to know if that's  actually real, you just got to ask Sam, real or fake?  Real. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, porn stars is real?  I got to think.  It's not sensationalized, isn't it?  It's a sister reality.  You know, it's a fantastic show, and Patrick from Philly says it right there online, too.  I watched this last night, the season premiere, I guess.  Of course, it's a fantastic show.  Now, that is a great fucking show.  What is it, Hitler's Follies?  That's my second favorite.  It's the whimsical side of Adolf, how he liked playing double-dutch.  He loved it.  Go ahead, Patrick.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Yes.  This show last night, I couldn't believe it. 
[01:00:00]  I guess I really enjoyed it just because it kind of dwells on the inner psyche of what's  kind of going on in other people's homes.  You get to look in it.  Dude.  Hoarders.  People living in a dump.  It's taking up forever.  Hoarders.  Hoarders.  Yes.  It is amazing.  That fucking disgusting old bitch last night.  And there's no sympathy.  I didn't see it last night.  What was it?  Yeah.  They show these people.  And I don't know.  Are you supposed to have sympathy for them?  Or go like, oh, man.  I just look and go, this ungrateful, disgusting slob. 
[01:00:30]  It was some woman.  And they showed some pictures of her from back in the 50s or some shit when she was married  or had a boyfriend, whatever the fuck it was.  And she was real, real Vodio Dodo, a real hotsy-totsy, I'd say.  And then they showed her now.  She's got no teeth in her head.  She's just an old bag.  And her house is full of garbage.  Dude, they took out 8,000 pounds of garbage from her house. 
[01:01:00]  There were dead cats underneath the piles of garbage because she's a crazy cat lady, too.  Is this the one from last night?  Yeah, yeah.  That's her?  That's the daughter.  Holy shit.  That's the daughter.  How do you live like that?  You don't.  It's...  And she gets so...  It stunk.  They said, like, shit.  The bathroom was atrocious.  You couldn't even...  One guy from the cleaning company said, I'm not going to do this.  I'm not doing this.  Why can't we just burn her house down with her in it?  That's what I said. 
[01:01:30]  I'm not even...  I said, just burn the house down with her in it.  And she sits there with a fan blowing on her.  Look at this old sack of shit.  Why?  Look at the dishwasher.  It's just...  What is that about?  She's just...  It's crazy.  What's that about?  She's insane.  Where you have to make paths through the guards to get to your bed and shit.  And the daughter, she's crying because she's trying to help the mother.  Oh, God.  And then they drag in a shrink.  Like, that's her from the old days.  You know, a little advice to the daughter.  Sometimes you just got to walk away. 
[01:02:00]  Look, that's the old bag.  And now look at her.  Whoa.  Ah, what happened?  Wow, what's growing on her fucking...  I don't know.  She looks like she has duty on her.  Oh, God.  She's got some duty on her chin.  For storing moles.  Well, some beauty marks could be sexy, but that's right.  Most of them look like duty stains.  It's duty.  She has some duty on her.  God damn, what a crazy old bitch.  The place was so disgusting.  And then she just sits out there, this fat pig, and eats.  Is it one thing she collects?  No, no.  Hers is just garbage?  Her son is 28 years old. 
[01:02:30]  He finally, like, was taken from the house and moved in with the sister when he was younger.  And he kind of got his life back together.  Yeah.  28 years old.  As they were digging through the garbage, the son was like, this is like history.  As you go deeper, you get older things.  There was a package of diapers from when he was a baby.  Oh, come on.  28 fucking years ago.  Flattened out, petrified cats were underneath the piles of garbage. 
[01:03:00]  And she's going like, oh, I could put a plant in this.  I could take...  So she takes this little, like, this little trinket thing out of the pile of garbage because she needs it.  Just stop already.  You think she'd do to hoarders?  Just push them into bear traps.  Oh.  Watch their knees get fucking junk.  Drive them to the fucking garbage dump and just kick them out of the car and go, here's your new one.  Yeah, live here.  Live here.  Figure it out.  You pain in the fanny.  Right.  Did you see the one where the guy was storing his own shit in a shed outdoors? 
[01:03:30]  What?  He had buckets of his own shit.  He makes this lady look like the bell of a ball.  No, it was a shed, but he had his own shit and piss.  He had buckets of his...  It was hazardous waste.  He's the worst person ever.  And you know when they clean out these hoarders' houses and it's like...  Because usually they give you the back story that the town is coming in and they're going to evict these people and throw them out.  And then the hoarder's crew comes in. 
[01:04:00]  And they got some shrink that just coddles these fucking morons and says, you know, we'll go slow and you tell me what you want to keep.  And then we'll talk and see if you really need it.  Go slow.  I would hand out...  Get the bulldozer.  I would hand out snow shovels.  That's what they do.  They use big snow shovels.  I wouldn't go slow.  Go slow.  And then things get thrown out and they freak out about it and shit like that.  So, yeah, this woman...  And you know, after the house is clean, within months it's just going to be the same fucking disgusting mess again. 
[01:04:30]  You'll never get the stink out of there?  No, no.  The stink.  There was a shit room.  We got somebody who looks like father was on hoarders.  David in Connecticut.  What's the story, man?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey, Jimmy.  You kicked ass Boston the other night.  Thank you, Dave.  Really great show.  Thanks, buddy.  Hey, it was actually my father-in-law.  He wasn't on hoarders, but he was a hoarder, and we went in to go clean his, what he called, an office.  And it's amazing, some of the stuff you find in there. 
[01:05:00]  Old coins, old cell phones, you know the big old brick cell phones that you used to have?  You found like ten of them.  Old computers.  There's different types of hoarders.  Like, there's people that will hoard certain items, electronics, tools, things like that.  And then there's these disgusting people that just live in trash.  They eat shit and then just, like, throw it on the floor.  There was one fat fuck that had, like, half hamburgers and roast beef sandwiches under his mattress. 
[01:05:30]  Well, under his mattress?  Under his mattress.  Why is he going to attract bugs?  Oh, cockroach.  The fat son, what this woman said when he was living there, he'd have to turn a fan on every night to cover up the sound of the cockroaches walking around.  Ew.  They would just be walking around on top of everything as he slept and come into the bed with them.  Cockroaches creep me out more than mice. 
[01:06:00]  They're disgusting.  And I had both in that old apartment of mine.  Disgusting.  Why doesn't the smell get to these people?  They were talking about that last night.  The shrink was saying they don't see anything wrong with it.  They don't, like, they look at their house and say that's the way.  What happens to their sense of smell?  They just don't smell it.  They lose it or what?  They don't smell it.  People walk in and they are wearing not just those little paper masks, fucking respirators.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  They have to go in there.  And like I said, one of the guys that comes in there said, I went into the bathroom. 
[01:06:30]  I can't do that.  He goes, that's a biohazard.  There's feces filling the toilet up.  The toilet didn't work anymore.  The water wasn't working.  And she was shitting in the toilet.  And then just, dude, it was a giant toilet full of shit.  And I don't know if she's shit.  And then it fills up so much that she's got to dig some out and threw it on the floor and in the bathtub.  And so she could like shit more in the toilet.  That's just a crazy person.  I mean, you're just nuts. 
[01:07:00]  What a kook.  I was saying, just burn the house down with her in it.  Just burn the fucking thing down.  You guys want to hear from more hoarders?  Yeah, of course.  Hoarder.  They rule.  I saw two guys from Operation Repo on other reality shows.  Yeah, they're just fake.  All right.  I guess we...  And the other thing, I don't think we got time to go to them.  Some girl admitted that the cheater stabbing was fake.  Cheaters is so fake, it's comical.  Yeah.  I'm not buying cheaters either. 
[01:07:30]  I'm not willing to give that up.  Hold on.  Let me...  All right.  Let's go to Jay first.  Then we'll go to another hoarder in a second.  Jay in Dallas.  What do you got on cheaters?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hi, Jay.  Hey, man.  That stabbing that went down, that actually happened, like, right down the street from my  house.  It was a little lake about 20 minutes north of Dallas called Lake Ray Hubbard.  My mom works for the sheriff's department there, and when that supposed stabbing went  down, they called the police.  It's not in the police law.  You know, it never has been.  So, apparently, the way it worked out is they just found a sheriff's department car, and 
[01:08:00]  they followed it for part of the footage.  Also, they had a girl, the girl that was actually involved, that they were on the boat, and when  the guy got stabbed, the host named Joey Greco, she did an interview that said it was completely  fake, and she said both of them were paid actors, and that Joey never actually got stabbed,  and that the ambulance company that picked him up was a private ambulance company.  They probably just paid them.  But as far as the police department goes there in that town, I asked my mom, but it never 
[01:08:30]  came across a police log.  The police never responded.  And also, it's not a huge town.  It's about 20 minutes north of Dallas.  If somebody got stabbed on the lake, it would have been a big deal, and there was never anything  about it.  Okay, you know what?  I'll say this.  The driver who told me it was fake, and he used to work there, he goes, yeah, the whole  thing was fake.  It was a gig I was doing a couple years ago in Dallas, so that makes sense.  Maybe it is fake.  All right.  Good job, Jay.  The camera work is very good in this, though. 
[01:09:00]  Well, yeah.  You got it.  They just showed a camera work where it shouldn't have been.  Where's he stabbed?  Where's the blood?  We're looking at the clip right now.  There it is.  Well, that could be wrestling blood.  I had to look at him.  He's like, oh.  What's that supposed to mean?  Oh, so dramatic.  Would he get stabbed in the gut?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  I like cheaters.  Oh, stop.  All right.  Let's go to Dean in Wisconsin.  Dean.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I got a mom that's a real major hoarder.  I was up at her a couple months ago, and I was standing there in her door, you know, 
[01:09:30]  in her foyer, and it just reeked like you would not believe.  And I looked down, and she had one of her cats had a mouse, and I said, well, what the  heck is this?  And she said, oh, they're buddies and stuff.  And I said, well, you ain't much buddies.  The cat's eating a mouse right now, and there's a couple of our mouse carcasses laying there.  Then there's a more noise coming out of her kitchen.  And I said, what's going on in there?  I said, you got another cat in there?  And she says, no.  And she goes, I got a bag of dog food in there.  You know, she goes, I don't feed the dog.  I just cut the top of the dog food bag open and let the dog eat.  But she goes, I think I got the mice in there now, and they're just helping themselves to 
[01:10:00]  the food.  And all she has is this path going through the place.  I mean, it's just totally disgusting.  My brother and I try to get, you know, some help.  We just walked away from the whole situation.  We try and let the county and the state get involved, but they don't want to get involved  in anything.  I mean, it's just pathetic.  It's your mom?  Yeah, it's my mom.  Do you get angry at her?  Because I know I just want to scream and go, you cut the shit.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  I mean, you just, you scream and yell at her about it.  And then, you know, the last time the county aid worker came over there, she says, which 
[01:10:30]  one of my fucking kids called this time?  I mean.  Yeah, they're usually very angry at their kids, these hoarders.  They're very, that's what I've noticed on the show.  They're very angry at their kids when they try to help them out and clean the place out.  They blame, they pass a lot of blame onto other people that the situation they're in is always  somebody else's fault.  So why don't they just let these people live that way?  That's a weird mental problem.  I think a lot of them probably do.  Enough with the stupid attention. 
[01:11:00]  Let them live like that.  Sitting there, you don't want to be the neighbor of one of these fucking people because the whole  block stinks a lot of times.  Hey, a lot of people say that they found her teeth last night?  Yes, yes.  They found her teeth.  What was that about?  They only found her uppers, not her lowers.  Well, they came in and the shrink is like, well, we're looking for her teeth.  So if you find them, let us know.  And one of the workers found, like after taking out tons of garbage, found her upper plate.  And they had to actually tell her, don't put that in your mouth.  She's ready to just slap it in her mouth. 
[01:11:30]  It's sitting in a dead cat's mouth, looking all silly.  And then they couldn't find the bottom part of her teeth.  Hey, dude, are there roaches in your mom's place?  Oh, I'm sure there are.  We didn't stick around long enough to find out.  I was afraid I was going to bring them home if they weren't.  That guy said that he would put a fan on because he could hear the roaches?  Yeah, yeah.  He'd put that.  And then the child welfare services took him out of the house.  Took him out of the house when he was a kid.  He moved in with the sister.  And then the mother was just like, why won't you come home and live with me? 
[01:12:00]  He goes, no, I have a life.  I can't live like this.  And she goes, well, you know, if I had the money, I would have been able to get you back if I could get a lawyer.  And they're trying to tell him, no, he was taken out of the house because of the way you live.  Right.  That had nothing to do with money.  She's like, no, no, it was the money.  It was the money.  Like just a crazy old, crazy old hag.  That old hag.  You're like, you're hoarding old hag. 
[01:12:30]  Puts it down a pile of garbage.  That shit is exhausting.  Oh, my God.  Just exhausting.  Are you a fan of cat ladies?  I'm a big fan of the cat ladies.  A lot of the hoarders, women hoarders, are cat ladies.  Why don't they have a reality show?  Just go around the country looking at the cat ladies.  Yeah, they should do that.  One of the hoarders had so many cats.  They were bringing out like 20 to 30 dead cats.  Litters of kittens, skeletons, just like sitting there.  Really?  And she's like, I love my babies. 
[01:13:00]  And then they took them away.  Wait, did she have a lot of cats that were still living?  Yeah, they took them away.  Look at, I love cat lady videos.  Crazy fucking cat lady.  You can't get enough of this.  Do you think there's fleas in that house?  Oh, my God.  How many, what video is this?  She's just throwing food on the floor.  Crazy Russian cat lady owns 130 cats on YouTube.  There must be so much duty in her house.  Oh, I just, start over.  They do sound.  She's throwing food on the floor. 
[01:13:30]  They're freaking out.  How do you sleep like this?  Kitties are adorable.  But they really are.  Cat ladies rule.  Do you know how many fleas they must have?  Oh, and just the smell of shit and cat piss smell. 
[01:14:00]  The video shows the lady walking into, I guess, like the kitchen area, and the cats are jumping  on her, trying to get to the food.  130 cats.  130 cats.  That was the kitchen?  I thought that was a special room she had where she kept all the little freaks.  No, they don't have special rooms.  The cat ladies let them live among them.  Yeah, yeah.  Wherever they want in the house.  This one hoarder woman, she had cats, but then they told her you can only have so many.  So she had to like hand pick which ones she wanted to keep.  And she's like, oh, I want that one, though.  And they're like, no, you can't. 
[01:14:30]  You're not allowed to have it.  Well, that's in one speaker.  Okay.  She's just lays a dummy.  She's just throwing food all over her own kitchen.  What an asshole.  I have no patience for these fucking nuts.  Cooks.  Just, you know what?  Walk in.  They make good reality shows.  Pull her out.  Fucking throw her in a dump truck.  Yep.  Dude, do a show on cat ladies.  Let's finance it.  People would feel too bad to watch it because of the animal cruelty.  They feel bad for the cats.  Yeah, yeah.  People would feel too sad for the cats to watch it. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, look at that.  Don't you just want to give him a little chin squeeze?  I want a shook-a-shook-a-shook-a under his chin.  Shook-a-shook-a-shook-a.  They love when you do that.  They love that.  Their eyes shut.  Lions hate that.  Yes.  Lions will bite your arms off.  You reach through the cage, you give them a shook-a-shook-a.  Shook-a-shook-a.  Jeremy in Cleveland.  We know Jeremy.  He calls the show a lot.  What's up, Jeremy?  Gentlemen, rape-dee-rape-rape.  Hey.  Hey, I had to clean out my grandfather's house like five or six years ago because he 
[01:15:30]  was like a really bad hoarder.  He had old newspapers from like the 40s and 50s.  He was a World War II vet.  He had a bunch of old bullets.  We had to like call a bomb squad because he had just splashes of ammunition in the attic.  Jesus Christ.  Like old shelves.  Newspaper hoarders are interesting because they always think they're going to get to it and  read it.  Yeah.  This old bitch last night is...  Oh, well, you just talk.  She had three dead dogs.  I think I thought I'd throw a three petrified dead dogs in the house. 
[01:16:00]  You're a conversation hoarder.  Yeah.  He's hoarding the conversation.  Exactly.  Sir, Ant's trying to jump in there and clean out some wreckage and you just keep piling  new words on her.  I just want to bring up the fact that that old bitty last night wanted to...  She goes, they threw away my crocheting books.  You can only imagine the pile of shit it was under in the first place.  And how often is this old bitch who just sits on her porch and eats reading her crocheting  books?  Why don't you crochet yourself a fucking rope and get a stool?  Do everybody a favor.  Fucking burden. 
[01:16:30]  Slob was here.  Hang herself.  But that's the type of thing you think you might need.  I'm going to crochet something for everyone who hates me.  Yeah.  How about crocheting a big coffin and throwing your dead cats in it?  You rotten old bag.  Go ahead, sir.  What were you saying?  Yeah.  It was just basically like dead animals, dead cats, just piles of shit everywhere.  Like anywhere you turned, there was shit.  There was nowhere you could sit or even move in this place without stepping in shit. 
[01:17:00]  Were there bugs?  Yeah.  It was like big, giant cockroaches, giant fucking rats.  I mean, like you could see rats outside of the house.  Like they weren't even inside the house anymore.  That scares the shit out of me.  Fuck that.  That rat shit is scary.  How do people live like that?  I don't even know.  How do you sleep?  They're crazy.  They're fucking crazy.  I tried to help him out, but he just kept on getting dirty and dirty.  I cleaned the place like a couple times and then I gave up and the state took over and  put him in a nursing home because I couldn't do it no more.  Exactly.  Let him just yell at some fucking black orderly who will knock his fucking false teeth across  the room. 
[01:17:30]  Sometimes the orderlies have a point.  Sean, the producer, she should make one of those crocheted wall hangings saying, home  sweet pile of crap.  All right, guys.  Fuck it out.  Break, break.  Bye.  All right.  Are we done with quarters for now?  Home dump home.  It's up to you guys.  You want to go with one more?  I love these people.  Yes.  My dad is a chronic hoarder.  My mom is a food hoarder.  Oh, they had a food hoarder on one of the shows and she couldn't throw shit away. 
[01:18:00]  She had rotting cabbage out on the counter and she goes, the good thing about cabbage is  the outside can be rotten, but the inside is still fine.  And she peels away the outside and the inside wasn't as rotten.  And she said, she opened up her freezer.  It was, it looked like decomposing dead animal because that's what it is.  She had like meat in there that was running out of the top of the freezer, like oozing 
[01:18:30]  out.  And then she said, her logic was, if it's not puffed up in a closed container, it's still  good.  And she goes, sour cream, it can't go bad.  It's sour already.  Oh my God.  And she was eating this shit.  Good letter.  Maybe she'll die.  Waste not, what not.  I know.  All right, let's go to, you want the food hoarder then?  Yeah, sure.  Let's go to Randy in Connecticut.  Randy.  Hi guys.  Hi.  Listen, my mom, she only hoarded food, but it was fucking disgusting. 
[01:19:00]  We had a cleaner house a few years ago and when we emptied out the closet, we found cans  from the 1970s.  Well, let me ask you a person of a questionable gender.  What were the cans banned?  Exactly.  I was sitting there going, I'm just trying to figure this out.  Is it R-A-N-D-Y or D-I?  We all, we all know this.  Oh, you're a girl.  D-I-E.  Okay.  Why do I sound like a man? 
[01:19:30]  No, I thought you were a woman, but they were saying you were a man.  No, no, I thought you were a youngster.  I thought you were a gay gentleman.  Yeah.  Is this a woman?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's apparently a girl.  What?  How old are you?  I'm 32.  Exactly.  Wow, you've got a weird voice.  You really do have a weird voice.  Something about the timber of your voice.  Great.  Oh, I love you guys.  I listen to you every morning.  So wait, cans in the 70s of what?  Cans of what?  I mean, you opened the closet doors and food was just pouring out. 
[01:20:00]  Everything.  Our freezer, our meat from like the 80s.  It was bad.  Oh, the woman had pasta with the fucking, like the maggots in it.  Those little maggoty things.  It was disgusting.  And she's picking them out.  I mean, I've never eaten my house.  But she did it really well.  Like it was behind the freezer, behind the closet.  You open up the refrigerator.  It was just food.  What finally tipped you off?  Was it like the fucking black caricature on the food?  This is not being sold anymore. 
[01:20:30]  This is fucking Sambo's rice.  This is no good.  Wow.  All right.  Goodbye.  Thank you, Randy.  Thank you.  More power to you.  Bye, guys.  Love you.  The timber voice.  We all couldn't figure it out at first.  Exactly.  What are you?  Madam, sir.  I went gay.  Wait.  You went woman?  I thought it was a woman.  You went young boy?  I went young man, young boy, young something.  Perfect name for her.  Randy? 
[01:21:00]  Randy is, yeah.  It's one of those names where you can try to figure it out.  That was a little odd.  What the fuck?  It was a little odd.  God bless you, Randy.  We were just talking about these shows, I guess, because we were going to get to Jesse Ventura.  Oh, now we've got to wait for us to break.  Of course.  But, yeah, that and Steven Seagal's new show coming on where apparently Steven Seagal, who  knew this?  20 years.  He's been a police officer.  For 20 years.  He takes it very seriously.  Is he really?  In Louisiana, down there in one of the fucking parishes down there, parish of Louisiana, 
[01:21:30]  he's been a cop.  And now they follow him around with a camera, and the black guy going, oh, man, it's Steven  Seagal!  That's pretty funny.  Like, I would just laugh seeing black guys going like, holy shit, it's Steven Seagal.  That's the rest of me.  I'm not watching this show.  I am definitely watching at least the first episode.  Yeah.  The name is so awful.  You have to watch Steven Seagal, law man.  I would definitely watch this. 
[01:22:00]  But he's like a legitimate cop?  Yeah, apparently he's been a cop for 20 years.  I don't get it.  Ah.  We're just sitting here watching, in Jefferson, yeah, in Jefferson County.  We're watching him doing some martial arts.  Why are they laughing at him?  And people seem to be laughing.  They're being sworn in as an officer, and there he goes.  He's packing heat, he's fucking got a badge, and he's chasing down bad guys.  He's Steven Seagal.  How bad did his career go? 
[01:22:30]  I don't know.  He was a huge movie star.  He still does films, I think, right to video.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the guy writes the video.  Look at him trying to run.  He's all fat now.  What are you doing?  It's so funny that he's fat running.  He's Steven Seagal, motherfuckers.  Now you need to be in shape.  Let's go to Heather on Long Island.  Heather.  Good morning.  Good morning, Heather.  Hi, Heather.  So, my grandmother is a hoarder.  Oh, is this Heather Heather?  Yeah, it's Heather Heather.  Heather Heights?  Yeah.  Red-headed Heather with the meaty tits? 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  Forgive my crude introduction.  That's a good description.  At least we all know.  Yeah, Heather with the eatable ass?  Pardon my language.  That would be me.  I am Heather.  And doing well in the comedy world.  Heather Heights, everyone.  What do you got, Heather?  I grew up with a hoarder.  My grandmother was a hoarder.  She actually lived in a trailer when I was a kid.  And she filled the trailer with stuff and bought a new trailer and put it in front of the old trailer.  Wow. 
[01:23:30]  Right.  I used to, I actually got food poisoning one time from stuff in her refrigerator.  And I opened up a can of soup and it exploded all over me when I was like a kid.  Jesus.  Because it was so old.  Is she dead?  No.  Is she still hoarding?  Yeah, she's still hoarding.  She had a stroke.  My dad had to clean up a bunch of her stuff while she was in the hospital.  She's still hoarding. 
[01:24:00]  Now she's.  Sorry to hear that.  Now she's hoarding drool on the left side of her shirt.  Yeah, she's a laugh riot, that woman.  Found it.  That sucks.  And she's a cat lady.  Oh, how many?  She, well, we get rid of them periodically.  She gets like up to 20 of them and then my dad goes and catches them all and gets rid 
[01:24:30]  of them and, you know, she just lets them breed all over the place.  How does dad get rid of them?  He, he traps them.  He's not a nice man.  That's why I'm asking.  Yeah.  He, uh, he, he traps them all.  I don't know where he takes them.  He's not taking them to the fucking animal shelter, that's for sure.  But they live up in the mountains in Pennsylvania.  So for all I know, he's, he picks them off, you know, with the gun.  Probably lets them loose in the woods and has a field day. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's, he's a great guy.  Right on.  All right, Heather.  All right.  Have a great day, guys.  Thank you, Heather.  Heather Heights, everyone.  Uh, we can keep going.  The hoarding calls are coming in like a lot of hoarding calls.  Should we take a break though?  I, I, if we can, I have an announcement to make too.  Oh my.  Very special.  Oh my God.  That, no, that one's too good.  Oh yeah.  We have to go to this first, Jimmy.  Hold on.  Oh, it's fine.  I'm in a rush.  Hold on.  Steve in Jersey.  This, this will be the last. 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Go ahead, Steve.  Yes.  Hey guys.  I hoard sewn up stomachs.  I hoard cum.  I put my mouth like a chipmunk.  I hoard duties and then I shirk them all.  Take that, stupid. 
[01:26:00]  I hoard links on my website.  I'm a logo hoarder.  That's right.  I hoard all this space on the video with my logo.  We got it.  Yes.  Sometimes.  Yes.  I had to overspin.  With my logo.  Yes.  That's the best part.  Yes.  There's a semicolon.  I put with my logo.  Oh look.  Someone's amused.  Oh.  Fucking cool.  Dracula's grandson. 
[01:26:30]  Fucking beat a creep.  Dracula's grandson.  Sorry.  What's his name?  Graham.  That's great.  Oh, Graham.  Like I ever remember the fucking worthless intern's names.  You should try.  Look at him.  He's just waving out.  Oh, that's funny.  Hello.  Go look in a mirror and see no reflection.  Thank you.  I hoard.  Exactly.  Go ahead, Steve.  Yes.  Yes.  So I just want to give you guys a call quick. 
[01:27:00]  Look, my sister has been hoarding her used tampons in her, she's got these trash bags  in her bathroom and we went in the other day and she's like 29 now and I guess, I don't  know, her shrink, my dad had to call her shrink because we found all these used tampons  that are like nasty and nasty and nasty.  It's unbelievable.  How much?  Yeah.  How much?  Go ahead.  Sorry.  She has some weird sort of like thing where she doesn't want to lose blood from her body 
[01:27:30]  or something.  I don't know what the fuck it is, but she just has these plastic garbage bags full of  them.  I don't know.  Supposedly like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them just sitting in her bath  tub right now.  Steve, let's get into this.  How much time does your family have to deal with your sister?  A lot.  Oh, is it a nightmare or what?  Yeah, a lot.  Enough about you.  How many could there be?  There's only 12 a year.  I don't know. 
[01:28:00]  Think about it.  Yeah, but she's 21.  12 a year.  She's 29.  So 13, right?  16 times 12.  160.  They start a little earlier than 16, Jimmy.  Well, wait a minute.  224.  Girls change tampons.  They don't just use one.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  That's right.  In my house, we did.  It was a one tamp per period.  One tamp per cycle, we'd say.  That's all you get.  Fucking sock it up.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  One of them.  Sorry.  Yeah, they use a lot of tampers. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but yeah.  It's a lot of fucking tampers.  It's nasty.  It stinks.  She happens to have a lot of cats as well.  So I'm sure she's probably just aching to be one of the supporters.  Cat toys.  She's batting around the house.  Yeah, you know that the cats are tearing those bags open, sniffing.  Gnawing away at it.  Copper treats.  Oh, shit.  There's something sexy about that.  Really?  No.  No.  She's a real beast, too, on top of this.  Of course she is.  Oh, is she? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, she is not good looking.  Jesus.  She's batting a sister.  How could she be?  No hot chicks stores her tampons in the bathroom.  No.  All right, guys.  Thanks for watching now.  That was a good one.  Very good one.  Why don't we play...  We gave him a lot of good radio, though.  Yeah.  Well, Jimmy has an announcement.  Yes.  Well, we got the Spectacular Suicide, episode two.  Oh, great.  Which is what?  We're going to play it until break, but what's your big announcement there, Jimmy?  Well, everyone knows that I have to plug Caroline's this week. 
[01:29:30]  But I'm giving away tickets!  I have a pair of tickets for every show, so I don't know how I can give away a pair,  but I have to.  Just do it now.  To who?  Random caller.  Can I get a seat?  I want to go see you, Caroline.  Dammit.  Yes.  212-757-4100.  Tell him to...  Call him.  Yeah, tell him to buy his...  Exactly.  Buy your own ticket.  I'll have to come...  I'm going to come up with a trivia question next break.  Oh!  So we're not giving away now?  No, for a pair of tickets to whatever show you want. 
[01:30:00]  The answer will be marmalade.  Thanks.  Well, I'll be honest.  I have to redo it, but what's a delicious treat that rhymes with smarmaclade?  That was actually the question.  Come!  Oh, you said delicious treat.  I thought you meant life-giving elixir.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:30:30]  Fuck it, eh, man.  Just calm.  All right.  Let's play Spectacular Suicide, Episode 2.  Here it is.  Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton.  Coming up on the next episode of The Spectacular Suicide.  Police Commissioner Vic Dumb brills our young hero about his mishandling of the Angerman incident.  Meanwhile, a deadly new tempteress lurks in the shadows.  Goddamn suicide. 
[01:31:00]  How many times have I told you?  I know, but the children.  That's enough.  You screwed up the entire operation, and Angerman managed to escape.  Whoa!  He escaped?  How'd that happen?  I'm unstoppable.  Never mind that.  It's our case now.  Stay the hell out of the way.  But, but, but...  That's enough.  Stay here.  I'm not finished with you.  I have to go take a shit.  The city needs me. 
[01:31:30]  I'll, I'll show them I can stop crime.  Hey there, Suicide.  Oh, no, Jenny, tell ya.  How the hell did you get in here?  My beauty was too much for this police department to handle.  Now, they're all stuck in my sexy trance.  No, you didn't!  Oh, yes, I did.  And now, I have you all to myself now, Suicide.  Stop it!  Why, Suicide, aren't you getting turned on? 
[01:32:00]  No!  I can't let this happen!  Stop it!  Get away from me!  That's right, Suicide.  Stare through my horn-brimmed glasses and into my eyes.  Oh, God!  It's getting too tight!  That's right.  No!  No!  Yes!  Come on, Suicide!  Oh, my God!  I'm coming!  Oh, my sweet Suicide! 
[01:32:30]  Now, with you out of the way, this city will finally be under my control!  Mwah!  What the...  What the hell happened here?  Suicide!  Wake up!  Wake up!  It...  No, this can't be happening.  It was Jenny Tilia!  She's gonna pay for this!  Stay tuned for an all-new adventure of the spectacular Suicide!  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do. 
[01:33:00]  Want to play this for everybody?  Because we're very proud of ourselves.  One of our callers called at...  He was on hold when we sat down in our seats at six.  Yes.  And he announced that they shot and killed that suspect that killed the four police officers.  Yes.  And we had it before anyone.  Now it's everywhere.  So we're a legitimate news source. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, my God.  We broke the story, dude.  At least a half hour before CNN and the rest of them.  At least.  Maybe even longer.  We got it right after the shot was fired.  We got the news.  That's us.  Newsmakers.  That's why I play this now.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony, your source for legitimate, up-to-the-minute, late-breaking, fair-and-balance, hard-hitting, angry-accurate news.  Yeah.  That's us.  Yeah.  That's us right there. 
[01:34:00]  What happened?  Oh, we already said it.  We know what happened.  I told the whole story already.  What happened?  We're not going to repeat ourselves.  What happened?  Maurice Clemens is dead.  What happened?  Maurice Clemens.  What happened?  He's dead.  What happened?  He got shot by the cops.  What happened?  He was a murderer.  What happened?  They shot him.  What happened?  He was confronting the cops.  What happened?  Well, they shot him in the head, apparently.  What happened?  He went to the hospital, but he died. 
[01:34:30]  What happened?  Oh, my God.  Shut up, you old bat.  What happened?  I hate you.  What happened?  Nosy bitch.  I'm not lying.  What happened?  Oh, I'm going to have fun with that button.  That button.  Let's talk about Jesse Venturi.  He's coming in tomorrow, and he was on Larry King, and man, this guy knows a lot.  You know something?  Jesse is a douche. 
[01:35:00]  He's got a new show coming out on, of course, True TV.  Which led to our last hour of radio.  Yeah, talking about all the other shows on there.  It started with Jesse, but we never got to the Jesse stuff.  Now, Jesse, apparently, has a show based on all of his psychobabble that he's been rambling about for years now.  Ever since he got out of the governor's mansion up there in Minnesota.  He all of a sudden just turned into some guy that's a conspiracy theorist guy. 
[01:35:30]  Thinks the government's involved in all kinds of shady stuff.  And his whole promo with this thing is that he's been on the inside.  He's seen and heard things, Opie, and now he's ready to talk.  He's finally going to talk?  Yes.  This guy was a governor.  Yeah, and he was also this guy with a feather boa and pink sunglasses.  I kind of like that guy, though.  He was all right.  On his promo, he says, you know, I was a governor. 
[01:36:00]  I was a fighter.  It's like, no, no, you were a professional wrestler.  Stop it.  And then he goes, I was a Navy SEAL.  It's like, you were a professional wrestler.  That's a put-on.  It's a gag.  And now he's facing down the government and all kinds of other people and scientific community, all that.  And coming up with all these conspiracy theories.  I can't wait for him to be in tomorrow. 
[01:36:30]  Let's see how Larry King handled Jesse Ventura about his new show here.  Now, President Obama will lay out his plans for Afghanistan Major Address West Point tomorrow night.  What are your thoughts on the possibility, apparently, that he's going to send 30,000 more troops?  Well, it angers me.  With an exit date.  Well, it still angers me because it reminds me a great deal of Vietnam.  I mean, the Russians couldn't beat them.  The English couldn't beat them over there.  You are not going to get a military solution, in my opinion, in Afghanistan. 
[01:37:00]  It's impossible.  And yet, we're just like Vietnam.  Are we propping up a phony government like we did in Vietnam?  Remember, if they were, the United States blocked free elections in Vietnam.  Had there been elections in Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh would have won in a landslide.  Well, is this the same thing going on?  Well, it's easy for Ho Chi Minh to win in a landslide, knowing that if you vote against them, you're getting your head chopped off back then. 
[01:37:30]  You're going to be in a pile of dead bodies.  Yeah, well, you know, the whole Vietnam thing.  It's very easy to equate a war to Vietnam.  Well, is Afghanistan winnable?  That's just it.  What's the definition of winning?  Is it just setting up a government that can, you know, act like civilized people and take care of themselves and have a police and army that can combat a Taliban when they kick over and start setting up training camps?  Or do we have to stay there forever and be world police again? 
[01:38:00]  Is Obama going to explain that tonight?  Yeah, Obama, here's what Obama's going to do.  He's going to try to appease everybody like he's always done.  And he's going to send some troops over there.  Not as many as what's his name there?  McChrystal.  What the fuck?  The general wants.  The general.  Not as many as the general wants.  And he's also going to talk about an exit strategy, which doesn't seem wise when there's troops over there and then your enemy can just kind of hang back and wait in the mountains until you leave. 
[01:38:30]  If you're telling people when you're going to leave, then just say, OK, we'll wait till they leave.  What are you going to do?  So that's what Obama will do.  He's Cheney's jumping all over him for showing weakness.  I've had enough of Cheney, too.  Well, Cheney's he's he's Cheney is posturing for something.  Yeah.  Cheney should shut the head.  Cheney ever fought.  I don't know.  Was he like a fucking rich kid that didn't have to serve? 
[01:39:00]  Was he in college and didn't have to serve?  I've kind of had enough.  Sorry to digress of guys who have never been in the military ordering troops into battle.  I've really had enough of these guys that get fucking deferments.  All of the Democrats and Republicans.  I almost think it should be a requirement that to be the president, you should have to have had military experience.  Yeah, I've almost I've had enough of these fucking guys ordering fucking men into battle who have no idea what it's like.  And when it was their turn, they fucking found a way out of it. 
[01:39:30]  Well, perhaps the best president wouldn't have made a good soldier.  I don't know.  Possible.  I'm just saying here's the deal, though.  So if you haven't served in the military, perhaps you should surround yourself with generals and other upper echelon military that can advise you because that's what's supposed to be done.  As he was advised that troops were needed.  And this was in August, I believe.  I believe in August they asked for troops. 
[01:40:00]  This dilly dallying motherfucker is finally coming out with a big announcement tonight.  And meanwhile, since he's been asked for more troops until now has been some of the deadliest months in Afghanistan.  Afghanistan, you can't you can't be this flip flop.  Try to fucking please everybody president.  He's realizing how little he knew about what was going on.  Oh, my God.  He thought, oh, we're closing down Guantanamo.  We're pulling everyone out of Iraq and Afghanistan. 
[01:40:30]  It's all going to be great.  The world's going to love us.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah.  Well, even Michael Moore is pissed at him.  Michael Moore last night said something to the effect of if he gives this speech about sending troops over there,  I am absolutely considering him the next wartime president.  Like he's putting him in the same category he put George Bush in.  And that's fucking Michael Moore.  No, Michael, when he was in here, he wasn't rah-rah Obama.  No, he wasn't. 
[01:41:00]  At all.  He wasn't.  But this is taking a lot of Obama's constituency.  First of all, Obama's never going to win over the right.  He's never going to win over Republicans.  Even a lot of moderate Republicans, he's just not going to win them over.  And now he's pissing off his base.  He's pissing off his base by not doing what he promised he was going to do.  I'm glad he's not.  You know, I don't like the idea of shutting down Guantanamo.  I don't like the idea of bringing up these interrogators on charges, pulling out of Afghanistan without any exit plan, shit like that. 
[01:41:30]  All of his ideas were these, you know, utopian, this is going to be great ideas.  And now he's not even able to deliver on them, so he's pissing off the people that voted for him.  Let's go to 2010.  It's going to be fucking great at the election.  Oh, it's going to be great.  Wait, watch, Republicans back in charge in the House and the Senate. 
[01:42:00]  Watch.  I don't know, you can't blame Obama.  This was a mess long before he got there.  I think you should handle it right.  No, you can blame him for bullshitting during the campaign.  And you could say everybody does it, everybody does it, but this was the new, the big change in Washington, the transparent government, all that bullshit.  That's true.  He just bullshitted everyone to get into office.  No change.  But Bush was in charge when they had Obama, bin Laden in their sights in 2001.  And he did the same pussy shit you'd expect a Democrat to do, which is just not let the military do whatever it's supposed to do. 
[01:42:30]  You know what I mean?  They did the same shit trying to fight a politically correct war under Bush.  You can't even imagine the arms that are tied behind backs in this war.  It's ridiculous.  The conditions.  How do you put conditions on war?  You know how World War II was won?  By killing a lot of fucking people until the country that went to war decided, we can't take all the people that are being killed. 
[01:43:00]  You can't do it with just surgical strikes and shit like this.  You need to make war a horrible thing.  Great Star Trek episode about that.  I want to talk to Shatner about it when he comes in.  Two sides.  They've been warring for centuries.  And they realized that their cultures were going to be destroyed if they kept sending actual weaponry back and forth. 
[01:43:30]  And in order for them to live on, their culture had to survive.  War destroys people's cultures, records of their achievements, things like that.  So what they did was they set up these computers that ran war simulations.  And when a bomb would hit, instead of ruining the city and libraries and records and everything like that,  they just sent people into a chamber to be disintegrated.  And it was great.  Oh, that's a very good idea.  But the war went on for thousands of years. 
[01:44:00]  Until old Captain Kirk jumps in and blows the whole fucking place up.  And the people were like, ah!  Now missiles are going to come over with everything.  And it was like, now you'll know the horrors of war.  And they actually got on the phone and started chatting peace with each other.  You have to know the horrors of war.  And sending a few troops, having limitations on things.  Look at that.  Danny's pulling up a beautiful mushroom cloud.  Beautiful!  Beautiful! 
[01:44:30]  Jesus.  Did you just come?  Like that mushroom cloud did?  Believe me, it took lickety split.  They were on the fucking deck of the Iowa.  Fucking signing away.  Whatever you want, motherfucker.  Whatever you want.  Or was it the Missouri?  Holy shit.  I think it was the Iowa.  I think the Missouri was at the bottom of the...  That is a city.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They fucked it up.  Boy, did that bomb do a lot of damage.  Yeah, that's a problem.  No, it wasn't the Arizona.  The Arizona was at the bottom of the fucking harbor.  Well, let's go to the phones.  That is massive damage.  We've seen Indianapolis.  You got the phones. 
[01:45:00]  They're all over the place now.  They all want in.  Let's go to Gutterbud in Jersey.  Gutterbud.  Hey, guys.  I just want to say, Cheney did have something like three deferments, just like all those  other Republican hypocrites, including Anthony.  And the Democrats are the same way they do.  Oh, shit.  I never got a deferment.  Yeah, but you never went for Vietnam.  And all you do is preach it.  I wasn't fucking drafted.  There was no fucking war.  Why was I going to sign up?  I don't work for a living.  Go sign up now, we say. 
[01:45:30]  Sign up now?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  They take me.  Yeah, I'm going.  Shut your yap.  Woody Allen had a great joke back in the 60s.  He said something about he had to register for the draft.  He's like, I had to register 4P.  In the event of war, I'm a hostage.  That's a great joke.  And by the way, when they brought back the Selective Service registration for the draft,  I was one of the first people on fucking line when I was 18 years old.  I signed right up. 
[01:46:00]  There was no draft.  But, you know, a lot of shit was going on back then.  Well, let's go to Matt in D.C.  Matt.  Hey, boys.  Hi, Matt.  You know, kind of like Jimmy, I am sick of hearing about comedians who don't vote talk  about politics.  That's not true, though.  It's very convenient.  The difference is this, dude.  Talking about politics is expressing an opinion.  It's not coming from...  It's indefensible.  Hold on.  It's not...  No, it's bullshit.  I choose not to. 
[01:46:30]  I don't care enough to...  I make my opinion known.  But I'm not sending people into fucking war.  I'm not a coward who hid when the country called on him and then sent you to do something.  Do you understand?  It's different, though.  You don't vote.  You sit behind your Colin Quinn quote and you comment at the comedian, which is very convenient.  And I love you, but fucking vote.  Why?  Shut your yap.  It's not true.  Colin had the best...  It was not Colin Quinn's stupid.  It was Colin.  He had the best thing about how people say you can't complain if you don't vote. 
[01:47:00]  He said, I don't vote, therefore I can complain.  That's not why I don't vote.  But it is a great quote.  It's just indefensible, buddy.  You've got to get out there and vote.  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  You're in the spotlight.  You're in the spotlight.  Back it up.  That's exactly what you're saying is what's silly.  Because I'm in the spotlight is irrelevant.  What I say is no more important than what anybody else says.  I'm a fucking comic.  I'm trying to make people laugh.  Here's my opinion.  Jimmy's opinion.  I don't claim to go out and vote.  I'm not telling you to go out and vote. 
[01:47:30]  I don't give a shit whether you do or not.  Because, like, let's say there's three people in this room and we don't go out and vote.  So what?  That's three less votes.  Who gives a shit?  Anthony votes.  Swazi gives a fuck.  I'll tell you that much.  Hey, Matt.  Let me go with this for a second.  What if we don't like the choices?  What are we supposed to do?  Vote anyway?  Yes, you are.  No, you're not.  For who?  You're not supposed to sit and pontificate about it then.  No, that's not.  You're being too emotionally invested in the fact that it annoys you. 
[01:48:00]  I don't vote.  You're not giving a real answer.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Seriously, Matt.  Hold on.  There's a percentage of Americans that's pretty high that don't vote because they didn't like the choices.  I'll answer you.  So seriously, what are we supposed to do?  That's partially right.  Anthony?  Hold on.  I go to Anthony.  Let me answer.  Vote for a candidate that is as close to what you want as possible.  Then instead of voting for, you know, if you don't like right-wing conservatism, vote for the guy that leans a little further left. 
[01:48:30]  There's a lot of candidates.  Maybe don't even vote for a candidate.  Vote for a proposition.  Go in.  See what's up for grabs.  Do your research a little beforehand.  And then vote.  Vote the tax revolt line.  If you're not happy with taxes, vote for...  You don't necessarily have to go in there and go, I'm voting for this guy because he's the greatest guy in the world.  But if you're going to vote... 
[01:49:00]  And I don't...  I'm not one of these guys that say, you know, oh my God, if you don't vote, you can't have an opinion.  But I would suggest that if you do want things to go a little more your way, that you should maybe talk to people, read a little bit, and then go out and...  Why?  It's all the electrical college...  Electrical college...  Electrical college anyway.  I mean...  Yeah, no, no.  Last time I voted was for Perot.  That was the last person I voted for.  I'm not even talking about president, dude.  President, I understand.  It's electrical college.  It's very hard for New York, let's say.  New York is never going Republican. 
[01:49:30]  I know if I go out and vote for the president of the United States in New York State, I am fucking wasting my vote.  It's just not going to happen that way.  But when I voted for Mangano against Tom Swasey as Nassau County executive...  Yeah, local thing here.  Dude, that fucking race, they're still counting these votes.  It's down to like a hundred and something votes separating...  So every vote did matter in that election.  Sure.  And it was one of those things where I felt like I had to get out and vote against Tom Swasey. 
[01:50:00]  Sure.  And I know I wasn't alone in that mindset.  A lot of people said, look, I'm getting the fuck out and voting against Swasey.  I hear you.  And it did make a difference.  Yeah, you're deeper into the whole political thing than certainly I am.  I want to go back to Jimmy because I was rah-rah Perot until the vice president.  Until he went crazy.  No, the vice president.  It wasn't even about Perot.  That's when I couldn't vote anymore for the guy.  I'm like, holy shit, where did he find this guy?  What was his name?  Stockdale.  Stockdale.  It was a fuck you to the system and to the way things are run. 
[01:50:30]  But to the guy on the phone, I am not sending guys into fucking war.  There's a difference between expressing your opinion, even being an opinionated ass, and signing decisions of send guys off to die when you personally took the deferment when you could.  Listen, Jimmy, I know I'm pushing the hard angle here, but I just see you as exposed as you have a microphone in front of your face.  And you pontificate, and you don't vote.  You make jokes about it. 
[01:51:00]  Yes.  But Anthony's right.  It's never perfect.  You never get the best guy.  Well, hold on, pontificate.  It's your duty to pull a lever so that you're...  It's not your duty.  It's your choice.  It's your choice.  It's your privilege.  It's your choice if you want to.  It's not a social contract.  But you know what?  You can admit that, too, but you're sitting out there, and you get to talk angrily at times.  Yes.  You know, into a microphone to the masses.  And then you can't back it up by saying, well, you know what?  This is the stand I took.  I believe it. 
[01:51:30]  You see, dude, what you're saying is I can't back it up.  Of course I can back up my opinions.  You don't have to vote in order to have an opinion.  Yeah, you're under this illusion that before it's a microphone...  I think that's where you're wrong, man.  I don't preach that you should go out and vote.  I don't give a shit if you do or not.  It doesn't matter to me.  So I don't preach that.  I'm not saying go out and vote.  You want to vote?  Great.  If you don't, don't.  I'm just...  Like I said, I'm taking the hard angle here on you, Jimmy.  But it's okay.  I don't mind that you do.  I don't care if you like that I vote or not.  But I don't preach that to people. 
[01:52:00]  I don't preach that.  You got to...  You know, if you're going to talk on a mic, you got to take some stands that are hard.  You got to nothing.  You take many.  You got to be consistent.  You take many at all.  I mean, you haven't voted since Perot?  That's right.  Yes.  Come on.  That's the last time I voted.  Yes.  That's the last time you were happy about anything?  I didn't even like...  Happy about anything.  To be honest with you, dude, I didn't even like Perot.  And if you think you're a better citizen, I guarantee I pay more in taxes than you do.  So I do my part. 
[01:52:30]  Actually, maybe I don't.  Maybe you pay more than me.  But I pay enough in taxes.  I do my part.  Most times, I don't find voting to be a particularly appealing option.  Because I really do despise most of them.  Well, I love this option, too, about bringing up your taxes.  If you are complaining about paying too much taxes, why don't you do something about it?  Like what?  Like get a worse job?  I don't have a fucking faith in any of them.  None of them are really going to help me.  None of them.  It's a little bit here, a little bit there.  It really is mostly the same thing. 
[01:53:00]  And I have opinions on it.  How hard is it?  How hard is it to throw a little lever that says, you know what?  I'm going to give this guy a little F off.  It's honestly not that hard.  He took a little bit more.  He took a little bit more than this guy will.  Maybe.  And I bring up again the whole Swazi and Mangano thing.  I voted completely based on taxes.  My vote for, like, Swazi, I don't even know.  Swazi never did anything in Nassau County that was all that bad, I guess.  I don't really, and I don't really know a lot of the things he did do. 
[01:53:30]  He was in for eight fucking years.  The roads seem really nice in Nassau.  Everything's good.  Yeah, the taxes, they got higher and higher and higher to the point where it's like,  what are we getting for our tax money?  Now it's starting to outweigh, like, all the good stuff we're getting.  So I'm going to go in and vote this motherfucker out.  And that drove me to go down and vote during a very off election year.  And again, I'm just, you know, I am pushing the hard angle here.  You don't have to vote. 
[01:54:00]  All right, Matt, you made your point for real.  Yeah, I understand what you said, Matt.  I think we gave Matt enough time.  Yeah, you did make your point.  And you know what?  I don't agree.  Jimmy doesn't agree.  Maybe voting is the right thing.  You know what?  Maybe the aunt raised a good point about you don't have to vote for one of the people.  I kind of like that angle from Anthony today.  Against somebody.  That's a fair point.  I might have to take another peek.  Yeah, it doesn't take much.  But just find me a short line.  I don't want to wait in line.  Yeah, really?  You know something?  The good thing is, it really ain't that long a line.  You just pop right in.  That's the time I voted at Lady Queen of Mars in the basement there in the church. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  It's a long line.  Long line.  You get old people that are like, I don't know what I'm doing.  There's nothing to do.  I have to fill out a form.  I have to.  I vote.  I'm schizo.  I'll vote.  Then a few years will go by.  Then I'll go back to it a little bit.  I haven't voted in a few now, though.  Did I vote?  What happened?  I'm ready to go back and deal with those people and vote again.  Second clip.  Jesse Ventura on Larry King.  And I'll tell you what should happen, Larry. 
[01:55:00]  We need an immediate Congress to pass a war tax.  Because you know what?  We're involved in two wars now, and this country is feeling no pain.  Well, I got news for you.  When you're involved in war, everyone should feel a little bit of pain.  We need to pass a war tax to pay for this war.  And I'm going to tell you something else.  It's time to bring back the draft.  Because these guys are on their fifth and sixth tours over there.  And I used to be an advocate for a professional military. 
[01:55:30]  I'm not anymore.  Because it's too easy for these people to take our young men and women to war and not account for it.  And let's pass one more law, Larry.  The next time the government votes to go to war, I think every congressman and senator should be required to pre-designate someone in their family begins immediate military service.  Because I'm tired of these people voting to go to war, and then they have no dog in the fight.  God damn it.  I agree with Jesse Ventura. 
[01:56:00]  God bless him.  Would it never happen?  No, but he's right.  God bless him.  You know what that is?  You can equate that with, and the murderer should be taken out and let the family beat him with rakes and shovels.  It's one of those things where it's like, it would never happen.  Of course not, but it wouldn't.  It's nice to hear that.  But the murderer's family beating the murderer, there really is no place in the law for that.  But the children of congressmen or senators.  There's no law in that either.  But I mean, there's nothing preventing them from doing that. 
[01:56:30]  You can't just let a family of a victim kill the murderer.  Yeah.  But you can allow the fucking, I'm losing my point for you.  You know what it was?  There was years, you knew what I meant.  Years ago.  During those noble wars, you know, like World War II and stuff, people were actually proud to join the military and get in the fight like that.  You would get senators' children and presidents' children. 
[01:57:00]  I mean, it was a thing of pride to serve and to go down there.  The lines, you know, at the recruiting offices were backed up.  Sure.  Now you just, it's, how can you stay out of the military?  Let's give these monetary initiatives to the soldiers so that you get probably the most destitute people join.  Yeah, poor people.  So they can, you know, then later on, if they live through some of this shit, perhaps get an education. 
[01:57:30]  It is a little off the way things are running where, like he says, these senators and people that are voting to go to war have really no vested interest.  None.  And what drives me nuts, Prince Harry went to the fucking war.  Yeah.  Of course he's protected and he's probably not going to be around the front lines, but at least the guy went over.  At least he fucking, you know.  What was that other one, Prince Andrew, was it?  Fought in the Falklands?  Did he?  Yeah, I think he did, right? 
[01:58:00]  Wasn't he the other one?  Yeah.  I think he did.  Like, for some reason, the English, they don't give a shit.  Did he get Bush and Jordan?  Bush and Clinton both had daughters.  Yeah.  Well, hey, females in the military.  Come on.  It happens.  Let's go to Mike in Westchester.  Mikey!  Good morning, Mike.  Good morning, Mike.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, one quick thing about the draft, and I don't know how you'll respond to this, but I read a really interesting article the other day that said Israel has the economy that they do, because everybody in Israel, with a couple of noted exceptions being the extremely Orthodox Jews there, everybody has to serve in the military. 
[01:58:30]  It's mandatory, yeah.  Everybody is taught responsibility.  Everybody is taught accountability, how to be part of a team, and how to think outside of the box, within the confines of the objectives that you've been ordered to achieve.  All that things would make you extremely successful in business.  So, even though I agree with you, a draft would never come to pass, if it ever did, and everybody did have to serve, it would change the face of this country in a generation. 
[01:59:00]  It does make an interesting culture when you have a country like Israel, where everyone, it's mandatory that they serve in the military.  And it shows later on, when the people get out of the military and get their jobs and do what they do, like, that country itself is a very strong, very no-nonsense country, Israel.  It's a no-fuck-around country.  Yeah, it's a no-fuck-around country.  Can you imagine a draft in this nation with people like the likes of Reverend Al Sharpton, though, and Jesse Jackson, and all these groups that would just be picking apart who's going, who's not, who's being drafted? 
[01:59:30]  It would be, like, there would be demonstrations, like, in the 60s.  It would just be a wreck.  In a lot of cases, they'd probably be right, too, because a lot of people that wouldn't be going would be fucking privileged people.  Perhaps.  Well, we're going to see what Obama says tonight.  Thank you, Mikey.  Then again, do we have a draft during... 
[02:00:00]  Huh?  Well, the reason I actually called was, I was in the first battle of Perugia back in 2004.  I was in an infantry battalion.  I was, like, battalion commander's bodyguard.  And you guys mentioned, like, fighting with, like, the fourth hand side behind your back.  We had the insurgents on their asses.  We went so far beyond where the planners of the higher levels wanted us to go that the insurgents and the code-pink fucking idiots  for some reason convinced our commanders to make it stop. 
[02:00:30]  They were telling...  They were, like, sending diplomatic friggin' missions to our commanders to have them call us to all the snipers.  It was ridiculous.  And the whole thing was complete bullshit.  Because, if you guys remember, not six months later, we went right back in and had to take the city all over again.  Yeah, yeah.  More guys got killed.  It was complete crap.  I mean, the number of times where we looked at a situation and were like, well, if we use overall force here, we're going to pacify an area. 
[02:01:00]  I'll give you one quick little story, and then I'll go away.  We had a gigantic AO.  I was in first battalion, quick learning, and we had an AO that went from the northern outskirts of Baghdad through Fallujah and all over the place.  It was one mess for those other giants that are out there.  And my platoon sergeant told me a story that when other battalions, other units, would transit through our area, they'd go through an Humvee's and they'd get shot at.  They'd go through an LAD's and they'd get shot at. 
[02:01:30]  They'd go through an tank's and they'd get shot at.  But our own Marines, and we were visually distinctive from other troops because we weren't camionetting on our cam blocks.  It was an old-school 1-5 thing.  Our platoon sergeant said that we wouldn't get attacked in our own AO because the enemy knew that if you shoot at the Marines, put the nets around their heads, they're going to come and fucking shoot.  They're going to come after you.  I was in an escort platoon, a battalion commander's platoon, so that he could go around the battlefield and talk to the other commanders. 
[02:02:00]  Our SOP.  You were with Colonel Kurtz, is what you're saying.  A little pile of baby arms.  Yes.  Inoculated arms.  Inoculated arms.  Our SOP for taking fire was the vehicle that actually took the fire, was to not stop, but immediately turn into the act of the fire and drive straight at whoever was shooting at you.  And the rest of the children would immediately flank and assault.  And I can't imagine what it would be like to be an insurgent. 
[02:02:30]  I'm sorry, I almost said something I probably shouldn't have.  But they're stupid AKs.  To shoot at somebody and to have them turn to the car and drive straight at you.  And I want to go to the party to literally start running at you.  Because that's the opposite of how most people will react when you shoot at them.  And I don't know.  I guess the Marine Corps, aside from what I've learned from my father, the Marine Corps.  Oh, does he love killing?  All right, man.  The Marine Corps may be the man I am today. 
[02:03:00]  And I honestly think if more people did so, it would make this country a better place because more people would get.  All right.  All right, Mike.  We love the show.  All right, thank you, Mikey.  We've got to let you go.  So, Israel's a different place than here.  But I don't think we had a draft in World War II or Korea, did we?  World War II, there was a draft.  Oh, there was a draft.  I was going to say in Vietnam, how good did it work out?  Korea?  I think there was still a draft.  Oh, so there was.  Okay.  Yeah, it didn't stop until 1970?  60?  70?  Maybe it was different because in World War II, people felt like we'd be in attack. 
[02:03:30]  Whereas in Vietnam, people felt like we hadn't been, you know.  Yeah, people joined because we were fucking attacked, you know.  And then other people, I guess, joined because they didn't want to be, they wanted their choice as to where they were going to go instead of being drafted and being told, you know, here's where you're going.  You're going, you're going to be a grunt or something.  Meanwhile, you're like, I think I'm more pilot material.  Yeah, no kidding.  When we move on, so Jesse's got the new show. 
[02:04:00]  He's going to be in here tomorrow.  Conspiracies.  First of the clips from Larry.  Mind control.  When he says mind control on that fucking promo, I nearly shit myself.  Well.  Secret societies.  Mind control.  Thermite paint.  You fucking lunatic.  I can't wait for him to be here.  Oh, it's great.  We need a time machine.  We've got to fast forward.  The first two clips from Larry King, not bad, though, from Jesse.  I agree.  Completely went on about it. 
[02:04:30]  And then he'll turn around and talk about, no, we have to colonize Mars.  Well, that's what I'm setting up here.  Yeah, no shit.  Okay, good.  Because he, wow, he went off-roading.  He's back with the 9-1-1 thing.  Oh, great.  Here he goes.  9-1-1.  9-11.  What is the 9-11 conspiracy?  Well, the 9-11 conspiracy is simply that the government hasn't been truthful with us.  I mean, Larry, a couple weeks ago, the head of the 9-11 commission legal, I believe he's 
[02:05:00]  former Attorney General Farmer from New Jersey, came out publicly and stated unequivocally  that at some point the government decided that American citizens would not hear the truth  about 9-11.  I find that very disturbing.  Which is?  I don't know.  What truth?  Well, we can't find it naturally because I don't have subpoena power.  You know, not telling the people the truth about 9-11 could be everything from, we did  it, we're the government and we did the whole thing, to, you know, there are certain aspects 
[02:05:30]  of this that might compromise our security, so we got to hold back on this.  I think that's a little more viable.  That if certain things are held back, certain information is held back, it's not this giant  conspiracy.  There ain't a lot of fucking people that know about it, especially in lower levels, and  the people that do know about it keep their mouths shut because it'll compromise our fucking  homeland security.  Or also, they don't want to look bad. 
[02:06:00]  I mean, the FBI and the CIA, a lot of these people don't want to look bad.  They don't want their agencies to look bad.  All those memos that came out that showed that this guy knew this.  I mean, we all know the stories now about how, in hindsight, it looked so fucking obvious  that it should have been stopped.  But, you know, hindsight, exactly.  Hey, Clinton had bin Laden in his sights and didn't go after him, and Bush had bin Laden  in his sights after 9-11, and they backed off in Pakistan.  So, it's like, even after 9-11, they still didn't handle things right.  Well, here's the clip that'll drive you nuts. 
[02:06:30]  It's the famous clip that he just...  No, it isn't.  I don't know if he says they're my pay, but...  All right, let's hear a look.  First time in Larry King with this.  What would they be hiding in that building?  I don't know.  What do you think?  In your wildest imagination, what do you think?  Well, in my wildest imagination, I find it very difficult that those buildings could fall  at the speed of gravity without being assisted in some way.  And I used to do demolition for a living.  And how could those buildings fall as fast as I used to free fall out of an airplane? 
[02:07:00]  I mean, if you took a billiard ball and dropped at the height of the Twin Towers and you just  merely stopped it and started it every floor in free fall, it would take over a minute and  a half to reach the ground.  The buildings were down in 10 seconds.  So you think it might have been something inside?  Can I...  Look, I'm not a building expert, but if you watch the towers fall, and again, I'm sure someone  will come up and go,  Go down, D.D. 
[02:07:30]  Gamekeeper.  But when the buildings fell, because of the way they were built, you had all these floors  attached to these erector set kind of things, and when the buildings started to collapse,  the fucking outer walls buckled out, so there was nothing holding the floors up, so they  all free fell.  They all fell.  As opposed to, they don't know, fucking building goes, stop, start, stop, start, stop, start.  It wasn't tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  It was the whole fucking thing just falling.  And we had Michu Kaku explain the whole thing.  He didn't give a good explanation. 
[02:08:00]  He said, it's like a free fall.  I'm like, I know that.  He said that buildings are made of air.  Yeah.  Mostly made of air.  Mostly made of air.  If you watch the Disney movie, Tugboat Willie, you will notice Mickey Mouse pulls an air horn.  Right.  Dr. Steve would probably be able to explain it.  But I think that because when you watch the footage of those fucking, those giant girders  under that held with windows buckling out, and there was nothing.  There was nothing holding the air. 
[02:08:30]  There was nothing holding.  Yeah.  Just because those sides are still up doesn't mean the whole inside isn't falling down in  the middle of it.  And what does he think?  All kinds of explosives can make it fall the speed of gravity?  Like, aren't the floors still falling?  Or are the entire floors waxed with thermite paint?  Thermite paint.  Am I going to hit him with that thermite paint tomorrow?  Tomorrow's going to be a good day.  Tomorrow is thermite paint day.  It sure is.  Wear your thermite paint t-shirts tomorrow.  Thermite paint.  I can't wait. 
[02:09:00]  Secret societies.  Mind control.  Know who else we have in tomorrow?  Who?  Fucking Ian Halpern again.  We love that fucking crazy Canadian.  We fought with him about race from Michael Jackson's book.  The Michael Jackson thing.  He wanted to come back too.  I like the fact that he's...  He doesn't care.  We liked him by the end of his segment.  We didn't agree with a lot of the stuff he said, but we liked the guy.  It's Wednesday.  He's Wednesday.  Well, isn't it tomorrow?  Yeah, tomorrow's fucking Wednesday.  What's the matter, Danny?  It's Thursday.  It's not the same day. 
[02:09:30]  Then it's Thursday.  So this is behind?  Danny, why don't you just admit you're full of fudge?  I'm just...  Hey, Travis talks in my ear.  I tell you guys.  Pass it.  Nice.  Nice.  That's my fault.  That's my fault.  I see what it is.  It says Jesse Ventura in studio tomorrow.  That would be Wednesday.  And then it says Ian Halpert in studio Wednesday.  So that would mean Thursday.  When I wrote that, it was still Monday.  Yeah, I get it.  All right.  So, all right.  Ian Halpert on Thursday.  That's going to be fun.  What is he promoting?  It's another book, I think.  I don't know.  But not the Michael Jackson book.  Shouldn't we know by now?  It's that Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie book thing. 
[02:10:00]  Oh.  A book about Brad and Angelina.  Ooh, sexy.  I bet you there's a lot of saucy information in there.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  I have to ask my trivia question.  What happened?  All right.  Here's a trivia question.  I have a good one.  What happened?  All right.  Jimmy's going to be at Caroline starting Thursday.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  I will give you the choice of the show you want your two tickets for.  All right.  This is the name.  He needs to call on the next break.  Name of the soon-to-be-released murder mystery revolving around a delicious spread. 
[02:10:30]  All right.  We'll take your phone calls after the break.  We want only the right answer.  Also, after the break, we got the Broncos head coach saying, fuck.  We got a guy that hates Christmas.  This is classic.  Classic story coming up.  And, yes, today's the day. 
[02:11:00]  Caller Bombs, volume two.  Oh, my.  Good.  It goes down today.  Good.  I went back at them.  Today.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Anthony went home.  A little Rush.  So it's me and Jimmy.  Yeah.  You know the Rush song?  Yeah.  Why was it?  It's actually very good.  Usually instrumental is annoying, but this is good.  Rush is still not in the rock and roll ball of fame, right? 
[02:11:30]  Dude.  What is that about?  Madonna's got to be there, so why would you put Rush for the rock and roll?  Hall of Fame.  Why no respect for Rush?  Does anyone know?  I don't think it's a lack of respect for Rush as much as it is these asshole critics.  The Madonna thing and all that, I mean, it's really the music Hall of Fame.  Right.  But they don't want to acknowledge that.  They still call it the rock and roll Hall of Fame.  So you understand the Madonna thing.  Whatever.  But bands.  Let's just go with bands like Rush that are in the Hall of Fame and Rush isn't.  It's stupid.  It's sickening.  It really is stupid. 
[02:12:00]  Is Rush still doing it?  Oh, yeah.  They're still on tour?  Yeah, they still go out.  I haven't seen them in years.  Oh, I told everyone you went home.  What?  Why?  I went...  I was talking with Artie in the bathroom.  About what?  Who's bigger?  Yeah.  We were showing each other.  You got your little man-to-man comparing?  Showing each other cocks and stuff.  No, we were actually talking about afternoon drive as opposed to mornings.  He gave me that same rap, too.  And that he was talking about how there's no fucking way he'd be dead if he went three 
[02:12:30]  to seven.  Because it's just...  I told him, I used to fucking have beers behind the monitor during the show.  Like, I couldn't even wait...  What are you talking about?  I couldn't even wait...  Hold on, behind the monitor bullshit.  Yeah?  Right in open sight.  We ran that fucking place.  That was when...  Making it sound like we were hiding the beers.  Well, that was when the...  I was hiding the beers when the GM was there.  But the GM was barely ever there.  Remember?  He used to fucking travel.  He'd come with his suitcase. 
[02:13:00]  His name is Ken Stevens.  Ken Stevens.  His name is Ken Stevens.  His name is Ken Stevens.  I get it.  When you get fired, you get a name.  His name is Ken Stevens.  I love that guy.  Did you like Ken Stevens?  I loved Ken Stevens.  Yeah, Ken was good.  Actually, I liked him.  You know that after he got fired, and man, we have gotten a lot...  A lot of people fired over the years.  Yeah.  He actually called me up after a few months after he got fired, and he goes,  Did I ever tell you that I love you?  Ew.  I go, What? 
[02:13:30]  He goes, This is the best thing that had ever happened to me.  I want to thank you for being such a fuck-up.  Wow.  Because he didn't realize that he hated his life.  Because he was heading to a heart attack, and I did not really understand what that meant.  And then I was driving through, and I was wandering around the country when we were fired,  and I was coming back up from the south.  I don't know where I was.  I think I was in Florida, and I stopped in Washington for the night, and I called up  Ken Stevens.  I've told the story, but I called up Ken, and he was so excited.  He was like, Let's go out for steak.  And he picks me up in a car that had to be a $100,000 car. 
[02:14:00]  I'm not a car guy, so I'm sorry.  I can't tell you exactly, but it was this...  A Prius?  It was a Prius, right.  Yes.  And he's thin, looked 10 years younger.  I bet.  I think his gray hair went away, even, if that's possible.  We had a good old time, and that was the last time I ever saw him, but he was happy that  he got fired.  Because he said to me at dinner, he was like, I was heading toward a heart attack.  They were running me around.  Oh, he was a madman.  He had to run three stations with high-profile shows. 
[02:14:30]  He lived out of a rolling suitcase that he would just come rolling and miserable into  his office, where we would be dragged in for some fucking inane meeting about something  we did or said, and he would be frazzled.  We took...  Remember that time he quit?  Yeah.  That's my favorite story.  That was one of my favorite Ken Stevens times.  That's why we got to write the book, because that story is one of my favorite.  Just screaming at each other.  And he goes, I am not taking this anymore.  And he took his suitcase, and he goes, I quit. 
[02:15:00]  He quit, and then he started rolling himself in the suitcase toward the elevator bank.  Me and Anthony run after him.  We're sitting in his office, going, you can't...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We were in his office, though.  We were in his office.  He left.  Now we're in his office.  And he's just sitting there like, what the fuck is he...  What the...  He quit.  And then I'm starting to think, wow, I kind of like this office.  Maybe we should move in here.  And then, and I, we paused, and we're like, man, no, we got to run after him.  Yeah, we can't let him quit.  And then we awkwardly ran after him, yelling at him that he can't quit. 
[02:15:30]  Ken, get back here.  But he was our boss.  We're telling the boss he can't quit.  Get back here, Ken.  You can't quit.  And then it was awkward, because now he had to roll his suitcase back in the office,  and he had to calm down for a few minutes, and then we worked it out.  He was shaking.  That was another Howard story, because fucking Howard.  Sounds like a real occasion of letting the inmates run the asylum.  Oh, Jimmy.  You know, that guy was a soldier, though, man, with all those Howard battles.  He fucking was right there for us.  We had a lot of fun with him.  So the beers, you didn't hide them from Ken, did you?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:16:00]  I never drank on the air in front of Ken.  Jeremy, if he caught me, I didn't give a shit.  Who's he?  After that, it was just...  No, they were always, like, Sam Adams lined up there, just chugging him down during the show.  So you said to Hardy that...  Yeah, yeah, so I was doing that, and he said, yeah, well, you know,  you hang out from 3 to 7, bullshitting with your friends.  He goes, well, you'd be doing that anyway, and then you're off, 7 o'clock.  You know, he could do a lot... 
[02:16:30]  He could probably do a lot of damage between 7 p.m. and 3 p.m. the next day.  Or he could do a lot of damage between 7 and 7.30.  Yeah, and then he's saying that how he doesn't know how you do it, where, you know, with  these fucking hours of getting up early, and you do a comedy at night, you know, doing  spots down at the cellar and shit like that.  It's called avoiding the ugliness of who I am.  Every waking moment must be spent focusing on other things.  I guess he's using a different tactic. 
[02:17:00]  Yes.  We all do, don't we?  Yes, his is put your face in your pillow.  Mine is just keep talking until you run out of breath.  We're both doing the same thing, which is just avoiding the unpleasantness of who we are.  Did I tell you I saw Scott Herman on the plane?  I told you that, right?  Yeah, I told you yesterday.  No, you didn't.  Oh, yeah, I saw Scott Herman.  You were on the same plane as Scott Herman.  Now you've got to explain who Scott Herman is to these people.  I was coming back from Florida, from vacation.  He's our GM when we first moved to New York.  We're back to New York, and he didn't want to be our boss. 
[02:17:30]  He ran 10-10 wins.  But Mel Carmson gave him the job because they were making some cuts.  So he was the all-news station general manager where, yeah, those guys are getting in trouble all the time.  Because they're actually doing the traffic report on the 12s instead of the 1s.  He couldn't lose at that station because it's like the number one news station.  10-10 wins.  They're making money hand over fist. 
[02:18:00]  If I could use the hand over fist.  See, they're grabbing money.  And he did not want to deal with a high-profile shock jock show.  No offense to him.  I mean, at the time, I'll speak for at the time.  At the time.  He didn't have a clue how to handle us.  No, why would he?  Or this type of radio.  Why would he?  Have things changed over the years?  I don't know.  But at the time, he definitely didn't know what he was doing.  Yeah.  I walked into the first class, Opie, of course. 
[02:18:30]  I walk into first class.  Please tell me he was in coach.  No, no.  He was in the seat right behind me.  I just hear, I hear, Anthony.  Really?  I turn around.  It's Scott Herman.  I'm like, holy shit.  And he's another one.  Looks great.  Doesn't look like he's aged a day.  And he was down doing some kind of golf school down in Florida.  I goofed on him about CBS.  I was like, so what are you running?  Are you running east or west of the Mississippi? 
[02:19:00]  They just cut everybody.  And it used to be one GM per station.  Now he's running like a sector or a quadrant or whatever the fuck they cut him into.  But he's still loving it.  He goes, well, you know, you guys are dealing with Mel now, huh?  I like, you know what?  Yeah, whatever.  I like dealing with Mel.  He loved Mel.  I like fucking dealing with Mel.  Cool.  Tom, I said hi.  Go talk to him.  We've had our issues over the years, but I like dealing with Mel. 
[02:19:30]  Scott Herman and Mel got along great.  They came up together.  At least he talked to us.  The last year on regular radio, the GM and everybody else refused to talk to us.  Yeah.  How do you have a high-profile show and not talk to the guys?  At least Mel would talk.  At least you knew what Mel was thinking, right?  Well, that's for sure.  That's for sure.  My greatest success story, by the way, speaking of Scott Herman, when I was able to say at  the Christmas party, that their traffic and weather sucked. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  That went over really well.  Scott Herman gets this idea, Jimmy.  Worst idea ever.  Scott Herman gets this idea.  That was a dumb idea.  We're tanked up.  It's the Christmas party when they used to throw really nice Christmas parties.  God, remember that?  That went away years ago.  God, this is like, we survived some kind of like...  Apocalyptic fucking war.  Yeah, and now we're talking about the good old days.  Christmas parties, that's like a...  That's...  We're in the nuclear winter now.  Yeah, they used to spend money on extravagant Christmas parties. 
[02:20:30]  Ridiculous money, and a lot of people out there, you know, they know about the really nice  Christmas parties that have now gone away.  Remember that?  And then they used to take all the fucking GMs and executives and go on these retreats  to fucking like Aspen, and now you can't get these guys to pay for a fucking business  trip.  They would get all the GMs, they would go somewhere, they'd play golf and get them hookers  and cocaine and little boys, whatever these GMs wanted to keep the money coming out. 
[02:21:00]  And now nothing.  So Scott Herman goes, I want you guys to say a little something at the Christmas party.  And for some reason, they combined the Christmas party, so it was the...  Yeah, that was the worst idea ever.  It's a news station, so they're boars.  And then it's like the rock guys.  Yeah.  All those young rock guys at the time, anyway.  Oh, my God, you must have been 20 at the time.  I was, yeah.  Since you just had your 30th.  Well, thank you.  The big trio.  And Scott goes, yeah, just say a few things. 
[02:21:30]  His aunt says something all nice and polite.  He's playing the game.  And I noticed a while ago that their traffic just was horrendous.  So I had to say, by the way, your traffic and weather sucks.  And I was expecting...  You could hear a pin drop.  As Scott Herman looked down, he was so depressed.  Oh, yeah.  He was so pumped.  He was not happy.  Went over like a lead balloon.  Oh, man.  Oh, horribly. 
[02:22:00]  But I wasn't going for the joke.  I was just going for the asshole.  Yeah, well, you did it.  Oh, it was awkward.  All right, anyway.  Yeah, that was...  Where are we?  That was terrible.  Broncos coach?  What happened here?  What did it do?  The F thing again.  Who cares?  I know we're playing it, but who cares at this point if people are saying fuck on TV?  Who cares?  They seem to be doing it a lot these days, and no one is really caring. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, my God.  Wow, that was...  Is that a homily part?  You better check your fucking undershorts.  That was a stutter step.  Oh.  God.  What happened?  What happened?  Blue Healer goes, hey, is this Phil or...  No, we were just reminiscing.  Give us a break.  Come on.  Just so people know, too, I want my trivia question. 
[02:23:00]  Not one phone call.  Because they didn't...  They think I'm bullshitting.  Not one phone call came in.  Somebody from New York or New Jersey.  Yeah, but they have to call.  I got a bunch of suggestions that people thought...  Jimmy, what's the question again?  What it was?  What's the question?  Get it out there again.  And then we'll get the people calling, we'll play this clip, and we'll go to the phones.  Name of the soon-to-be-released murder mystery revolving around a delicious spread. 
[02:23:30]  If you have that answer, Jimmy's going to give you tickets to see him at Caroline's Thursday,  Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.  One of those days.  Yeah, a couple tickets, whichever show you choose.  Right.  You know what?  Fucking E-Rock just sent me a picture of Ken Stevens.  I'll fucking tweet this, motherfucker.  Yeah?  I'll tweet this, motherfucker.  Is it a good one, or a new or old one?  I'm hoping it's the picture with him with the giant pen.  Because then...  This is the best, by the way.  This is the best Ken Stevens story. 
[02:24:00]  Remember this?  Look, I got it right here.  I'm going to tweet it, OP Radio in a second.  The giant pen.  Anthony and I were such fucking assholes.  We were doing really well.  And they wanted to syndicate us and stuff, and our contracts were over.  So me and Anthony, we refused to sign the new contract.  That's how cocky we were.  And Ken would keep coming in day after day with contracts.  Like, time to sign this.  Time to sign this.  Time to sign this.  And we just refused.  And then one day...  Yeah, we'll sign it.  One day he walks in. 
[02:24:30]  I'm going to send this right now.  He walks in with a giant pen.  Yeah, it was...  A big, giant, wacky pen for...  Five feet long.  ...to sign the contract.  I'll tweet that picture.  Giant pen.  Everyone remembers the giant pen.  Okay, here's the Broncos coach.  For head coach, Josh McDaniels.  All we're trying to do is win a motherfucking game!  Josh McDaniels, pretty livid at his ball club. 
[02:25:00]  Trader with the kickoff.  The motherfucking game!  The motherfucking game!  Well, that's what you're supposed to hear if you're micing, you know, coaches or players.  What do you think they're saying out there on the field?  And then not an honest moment from the announcer.  Wouldn't you at that point go, holy shit?  Holy shit?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, a little livid.  Right.  Motherfucker, was he a little livid?  At that point, what the hell? 
[02:25:30]  You have nothing to lose?  The curse is already out there.  You might as well just pile on with more curses.  Jimmy, would you like the answer?  Sir, I'd like to see, yes, if someone knows it.  All right.  Let's go with this person from Jersey.  This person from Jersey.  A time for marmalade.  No!  Damn it.  A time for marmalade.  Who are you, sir?  I'm John.  From where?  New Jersey.  A time for marmalade was different. 
[02:26:00]  There had been a murder committed, and it was for marmalade.  And that was why it was committed.  The name of the movie, but I'm going to give it to you.  Oh, wow.  Simply because you're the only person who cares.  No, the murder mystery is a case for Orange, The Marmalade Chronicles.  That will be out in 2020.  I hate you and your fucking marmalade.  Why?  I just hate marmalade. 
[02:26:30]  So, John, if they put you on hold, maybe Travis.  That's a good one.  No, dial M for marmalade.  Dial M for marmalade.  That's the one right there.  Come on.  Let Travis take your information.  Tell him what show you want to come to.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  He's there.  Have fun.  Dial M for marmalade.  It's pretty funny.  Why don't we do this?  We got a man that hates Christmas.  Ah.  You got to love this guy.  I'm having my house all Christmas-y.  When?  Oh, it's in the making. 
[02:27:00]  The outside's all done.  It's the, again, the only house with Christmas decorations.  My friggin' neighborhood.  Come on.  Can't the Jews just have a little fun with some lights?  And more than just, what, six, nine?  How many are on that goddamn thing?  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight crazy nights.  Eight gifts.  A dreidel.  But now the inside is being all done.  Ant is over there, you know, tinkering with the inside.  It is really funny with Ant's house with all the lights outside because, you know, no one else, like he says, no one else has lights up. 
[02:27:30]  So when you drive by at night, it just looks like a giant gingerbread house in the middle of nowhere.  Like, it is very, very interesting.  It's like, I got a couple of pictures.  There's a reason for that.  Anthony is known as an obnoxious guinea.  I am such a wop.  Dude.  It has guinea written all over it.  I'm not even trying to hide it.  Where's your Virgin Mary statue of fucking water coming out of the ears?  The ears. 
[02:28:00]  Jesus.  Ah, shit.  It's true.  It's just fucking garland and lights and wreaths and shit.  It's fantastic.  I like, I kind of like having the whole Christmassy thing going on.  I'm not a big, like, Christmas guy because I don't like the, I don't like buying presents and all that happy horse shit that goes along.  But I just like a nice Christmassy house.  Isn't it nice when you walk in and there's a tree and fucking all kinds of decorations and lights and stuff? 
[02:28:30]  Nice.  I'm getting my tree, I think, like tomorrow.  Are you?  I'm going early with the tree this year.  Do you get the real one?  Fuck yeah.  Nah.  Fuck that.  Why?  It smells good.  Because mine's 20 feet tall.  Oh, yeah.  It's like the fucking Rockefeller Center tree.  I can't have a real tree.  You should, though.  It's retarded.  I wonder if you could get a real tree of that size.  I probably could, but I don't want.  It's probably, I'm sure, a company that specializes in that. 
[02:29:00]  And just going back to the Ken Stevens thing for one more second.  This is how, we are the biggest fucking assholes.  Ari from Long Island reminds me.  Just to refresh your memory, you guys.  You guys demanded the giant pen or you wouldn't sign the contract.  What's that?  What idiots we are.  So we had to go out and find a fucking giant pen.  And then we finally said, all right, all right.  Well, here's a guy that hates Christmas.  An Ohio man who claims he hates Christmas is being held on $25,000 bond after he allegedly stole one of the Salvation Army's famous red kettles. 
[02:29:30]  The theft occurred Saturday evening outside a Toledo area store.  The bell ringer says she tried to pull the kettle away from the man, but he knocked her down and said, quote,  I can't stand you and your bell ringing.  I hate Christmas.  The Salvation Army says the kettle was stuffed with up to $700.  Police say the woman chased the thief into the store parking lot before he tossed the loot into the back of a stolen pickup truck and sped off. 
[02:30:00]  One shopper managed to get the vehicle's license plate number while others helped the bell ringer.  An empty kettle was found on Sunday.  Sean Creaker was taken into custody the following day and charged with robbery.  He could face more charges for that stolen vehicle.  What a dick this guy is.  Stolen vehicle.  What?  I don't know.  For what?  Is that even worth playing?  Who cares?  Hey, he hates Christmas. 
[02:30:30]  What kind of person hates Christmas?  I hate people that love Christmas too much.  What kind of guy that doesn't love the spirit of Christmas?  Fuck you.  People that really overdo it with loving Christmas.  Yay, Christ.  I call it gift day.  Give me a fucking gift.  No, keep Christ in Christmas.  That's what I say.  People are saying happy holidays.  Keep Christ in Christmas.  That went away fucking a hundred years ago. 
[02:31:00]  I know.  But you know something?  People are now saying, trying to just say happy holidays to not offend.  And three quarters of this great nation want to keep Merry Christmas over one quarter that is fine with happy holidays.  So that means the one quarter will win because that's how it works in this country now.  There's a school, I believe it's New Jersey, I'm not sure exactly where, I heard this last night, that will not be singing any Christmas songs.  You can't have like Silent Night, Holy Night, nothing with any religion in it or anything. 
[02:31:30]  And they will not be allowed to sing any of those during their Christmas or their holiday pageant thing.  No, the winter festival.  Winter festival, whatever it is.  They call it now.  It's gotten really stupid.  But can I, let's break it down though.  When you were singing those songs.  Break it down.  When you were a kid.  Yeah.  You didn't know what the meaning was.  You just said, oh, it's a cool little song I'm going to sing for everybody.  It's kind of, you know, I think it's just, you know, a little too much political correctness going on there.  I'll tell you who doesn't have political correctness is this motherfucking building. 
[02:32:00]  You see that tree in the lobby?  They ain't scared of the haters.  The holiday tree?  The holiday tree.  It says holiday tree on it.  It doesn't say Christmas anywhere, does it?  It's a Christmas tree though.  Oh, no, no, no.  You don't understand something.  See, I was watching a show last night on behind the scenes at Disney World for Christmas.  Oh, no.  And they show how they set up all the Christmas things.  They never say Christmas, by the way.  Holiday.  And they have holiday trees all over.  And they go, this tree, you know, this holiday.  Never saying Christmas tree, ever. 
[02:32:30]  No word Christmas is anywhere.  But seeing the tree, you think Christmas tree.  Because a lot of buildings don't put up a tree like that.  You see the tree in the lobby?  It's just a tree.  Until you start putting Christ in and Christmassy things, though.  This is a Christmas tree.  This is a Christmas tree.  There's actually a button where whenever Jews walk by, the tree goes, boo.  Let's hire a guy to do that one day in the lobby.  Boo.  I don't mind holiday as much.  And I agree with political correctness being shitty.  But it's like, eh, who cares? 
[02:33:00]  They want to call it a holiday.  But to change it.  If it was originally called holiday, fine.  And someone came by and said, let's make it Christ Day.  You'd be like, ah, go fuck yourself.  I mind a lot.  Why change it?  Because I wouldn't want Islamic holidays or some other fucking Jewish holiday.  I wouldn't want any holidays.  I mind a lot.  Because it's not even a religious holiday anymore for most people.  They want to add everything.  Close to a religious holiday.  It was, you know, growing up, Christmas and fucking Hanukkah.  That's all you get.  I don't want to hear Kwanzaa.  I don't even know what the Muslims do.  They put somebody's fucking head on top of the tree. 
[02:33:30]  Is that it?  Someone from the Western press.  They get their noggin put on top.  They said it twice.  And even Hanukkah.  That's how adamant I am.  Head and noggin.  Good.  Noggin.  Even Hanukkah, though.  I should have started with noggin.  Yeah, you should have.  Because it sounds like egg noggin.  Egg noggin.  That's what they have.  They drink egg noggin.  Yes.  It's just an egg out of a severed skull.  They wonder why it's not a delicious treat that the kids like.  Noggin. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, I kind of like Christmas.  Sure.  Christmas.  Well, the 12 days of Christmas.  Every day we're going to give you a little Christmas fun.  Oh, I like that.  You know the 12 days of Christmas?  Yeah, what?  Well, the price has gone up again this year.  Oh, no.  Not this bitch.  Oh, I hate this bitch.  What does she want?  Like, what is it?  She wants a bunch of horse shit.  It's a partridge.  Who the fuck wants a partridge?  In a pear tree. 
[02:34:30]  Why would you want a pear tree?  Because perhaps you like pears.  And you're tired of buying them because the grocer always tries to molest your children.  So you decide to draw your own pears.  Because the grocer fondles your children as you're bundling your pears.  That's my thoughts.  Poor memory.  Yes.  I usually go to Ted's 12 Days of Christmas Emporium to buy everything.  Oh, very nice.  It's a one-stop shop.  It's certainly if you get whatever you need.  On the first day of Christmas, someone said to me, I'd like this for my tree. 
[02:35:00]  No, that wasn't it.  It certainly is.  It's a partridge in a pear tree.  I don't have any pear trees.  I had a bush.  Well, can I get...  A robin in a bush.  No, what if I need turtle dubs?  I don't know what a turtle dove is.  It sounds like a crossbreeding.  Turtles and doves never make love.  The turtles bite them and the doves fly away.  What about some, I need maids a-milking?  I don't know what maids milking means, Anthony.  I don't either.  What is that?  I got minute maids a-milking. 
[02:35:30]  That's milk in a minute maid container.  Boo, Ted.  That's 12 Days of Christmas Emporium stinks.  It's fantastic.  No, it's not fantastic.  It's full holiday fun.  But you don't have any of the real things that we need.  What about five gold rings?  I do have that.  All right.  Well, actually, they're not gold.  They're black cock rings that I've spray-painted in gold.  And I have four of them.  Where's the fifth one?  You have to cut one in half and make two. 
[02:36:00]  I'm going somewhere else.  I got my Christmas.  On the first day of Christmas, my true love, ask for me to video the Parcher's family.  I have that.  Oh, God.  Oh, is the speech on?  Jesus, man.  What the fuck?  What?  I'm sorry.  You got confused.  Not a word.  That's not a speech.  All right.  Well, the price is up another $800. 
[02:36:30]  $794 to be inside.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a 1% increase.  The 12 items, or the 12 Days of Christmas, will now cost...  Exactly.  It's a lot of money.  And how do they fucking know how much...  He makes a milking.  Yeah.  Stop it.  I have to hire him.  And the monkey was punching Ben Stiller.  It's a night at the museum.  Night at the museum.  Battle of the Smithsonian. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, it's out on DVD.  And this is how bad it is.  They got the guy with the monkey trainer is promoting it.  Look how cute.  No one else.  They couldn't get any of the stars to do it.  No.  So the guy who trained the monkey...  Oh, my God.  Isn't it cute, though?  Those aren't the ones that rip your face off.  Yes.  Those are the ones that throw shit at you and piss.  Aw.  Look at his little head.  He is adorable.  Why don't you get one of those for your house, Ant?  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  He'd hang on the chandelier and make duty all on the floor.  You'd make duty everywhere.  Duties. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, look.  He's got little diapers on.  They are cute, though, aren't they?  No.  If you could keep him in the...  Look, he's wearing pants.  He's standing on the man's head.  He's smacking the guy in the head.  The anchor.  Right as D-boy.  And he's licking his face.  Let's get this monster in studio.  This thing...  Steve, book this monkey.  This monkey is very scary, though, because they just can go off on you.  Steve, can we get this guy in here?  We'll promote the DVD.  He scratched his little honey.  Oh, look.  He's scratching under his arm like a little monkey does.  He sticks his tongue out. 
[02:38:00]  He smiles.  Look, he's smiling.  What the hell is that?  It's like the universal signal for a blowjob.  Wow, look at how he does all these little things.  Look at his little hands.  He's clapping.  I want to have a monkey and just talk to it.  It would be fun to just own one if he wasn't so shitty and stinky and pissy.  And wild.  Yeah.  Yeah, you sleep and he chews your fucking toes off.  I want to hold the monkey.  Do you want to see what the morning mashup's talking about today? 
[02:38:30]  What?  Hmm?  No.  No.  You'd rather talk about the monkey?  Yes.  I don't give a damn.  I'm just looking around.  I better shout at fucking the monkey.  Jesus.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to play Danny's girl queefing.  Okay.  What?  Cool.  Can she do it just so happy together?  I don't know.  Maybe.  No.  What?  Well, Danny's girl.  There's a good queefer, I guess. 
[02:39:00]  And Danny decided that he needed to tape her and get the audio on the show.  Well, why wouldn't I bring it in?  If I have it, I wouldn't be doing my job.  You're right.  All right.  Do we just play it?  Does it need a setup?  No, it's queefing.  It's air coming out of a vagina real fast.  All right.  That was being air sucked in and then blown out. 
[02:39:30]  What happened?  Holy shit. 
[02:40:00]  That's pretty impressive, Danny.  Yeah, she's pretty good.  She does this move where she could suck it in and then she stands up and crosses her legs  to get the maximum effect.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  What's the noise that sounds like a bottle rocket going off?  That's the air going in.  That's the air rushing in.  Wow.  Really?  Yes.  She can suck air in like that?  Yeah.  It's pretty good, right?  Wow.  That is amazing.  That's pretty impressive.  Imagine the space station.  I love it.  He's queefing. 
[02:40:30]  He's like, ugh.  At least...  I always think queefs are going to smell.  Why?  Because they sound like farts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They come out of the box.  But they don't.  They're so fun.  Yeah.  Oh, there's one more about the queefing.  Here we go.  Oh.  Jimmy pulled the mic to his ass to fart into it and pulled the mic right off the cord.  Oh, wait.  Jimmy's ass queefing.  What happened?  Yes.  What happened?  Relax, lady.  It's okay. 
[02:41:00]  Why don't we take a break?  Oh, it's dreadful.  Oh, is it bad?  Dreadful.  Dreadful.  My thought is dreadful.  Dreadful.  Oh, God.  Dreadful.  When we get back, we turn the spotlight on the callers.  Oh, great.  Caller Bombs, Volume 2, next.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:41:30]  Radiohead, right?  No, it's mute, Matt.  Ah, fuck.  Okay.  Oh.  Kind of got a little Radiohead sound to them, no?  I don't know anything Radiohead does.  Huh?  Yeah, a little bit.  I don't know any Radiohead stuff.  Oh, get Ben's.  Get the Ben's.  It's good?  I like it a lot.  Although Stephen Lynch was turning me on to their latest CD.  I still didn't get it. 
[02:42:00]  That sounds like Radiohead right there.  A little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  Are they popular?  Are they what?  Radiohead's big, right?  Oh, yeah.  We didn't congratulate Dark Jeter, named Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year.  Mad Dog, when he was on our show yesterday, called it.  Yeah.  First Yankee to win in 55 years.  Wow.  No, first Yankee to win in 55-year history of the fucking award.  Why is that?  This is the first Yankee.  Okay, I got it.  That seems a little...  Purposely jaded. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Probably like Rolling Stone and good bands.  You know how they diss them, like they're too cool for the room kind of thing?  I mean, to defend Sports Illustrated, I mean, they go with a lot of individual athletes  for the most part.  Yeah.  I mean, I know they go with Team Sports in 55 years.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  Why was he Sportsman of the Year?  All right, hold on.  What other Yankees should have won in the last 55 years?  Let's go with that.  Let's think.  What year was 55 years ago?  1954. 
[02:43:00]  Maybe Mantle?  Yeah.  Or Maris?  Breaking the home run record?  Well, there you go.  Maris is a good one right off the bat.  Who else?  Reggie, maybe?  Maybe Reggie, yeah.  I mean, for...  What year was that, 77?  Reggie was fucking huge in 77.  Reggie, 77?  Okay.  And you want to know who won in 77?  Who?  Steve Couthin?  Who's a horse racer?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's all around, like...  It's every sports person.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I knew it was every sport.  I still think it should have been another Yankee. 
[02:43:30]  It's the whole sports world, so it's not that outrageous.  How about...  I'm sure Ali has won a few times.  Who won the year that Maris did well there?  What year was that?  61, right?  I tell you how many runs he hit.  What year was that?  60...  I don't know.  Fuck.  We suck at sports.  We just don't know.  I believe that was 1960.  Yeah, if he was in here, he'd have it right off the top of his head.  He'd know every fucking stat.  Jesus.  What year was it?  We could just look it up.  Have Danny guggle it.  Name a couple other Yankees that should have won it.  Between 54 and now. 
[02:44:00]  DiMaggio was done by then.  Joey D.  I wouldn't mind seeing fucking Rivera.  Then again, maybe they wouldn't be sportsmen.  They wouldn't be a pitcher.  Maybe no one.  How about fucking Jim Abbott?  No, fuck Abbott and his stupid one-arm.  He threw a no-hitter with one arm.  Yeah, good for him.  Dude, he threw a no-hitter with one arm.  Good for him.  Let's see him do some push-ups.  You know what?  I'd rather see a one-hitter with no arms.  Now that's something.  How about a two-hitter with four arms? 
[02:44:30]  We can go on all day.  Where does it end?  Jim Abbott should have won sportsman of the year.  Whatever.  Congrats to Dirk, Jeter.  He won it this year.  Who else has won it?  What?  Who else has won it?  What are a couple other athletes that have won it?  Over the years?  I'm sure Ali.  Of course, Ali.  Yeah.  Did you say Ali?  Ali.  I would say Ali.  Muhammad Ali.  No, it's Ali.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's guess.  Sportsman of the year. 
[02:45:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Mute Math is a Christian band?  Really?  Hey, if it sounds good, who cares if they sing about Jesus?  Are you a Christian band lover?  No.  Wait, Danny, I don't want to see the list.  Yeah, yeah, turn the list away.  Let's guess.  I'm going to look at the list.  Turn the list away.  I guess Ali.  Nope.  Yeah, of course, 74.  Only once?  Jimmy Johnson.  Nope. 
[02:45:30]  This bit sucks.  How about Arthur Ashe?  Of course it has to be Arthur Ashe.  Tiger Woods is obviously won it.  Nope.  He has to.  Tiger's got to be there, right?  Billy Jean King, who I saw.  Arthur Ashe in 92.  You got your Tiger Wood in there.  Sure, Woods.  Mark McGuire, of course.  Sammy Sosa shared it in 98.  Tiger again.  You got Lance in there.  Armstrong.  Brett Faraver.  Brett Faraver.  I agree.  Michael Jordan. 
[02:46:00]  Who won in the 50s?  Michael Jordan.  Oh, Jordan.  Sure.  Got a Michael Jordan.  Roger Bannister.  How about Pele?  Pele.  No, he's a stupid sport where they use your head.  How could you not?  If Pele didn't win, that fucking award should just be his.  What about Sandy Colfax?  Are you kidding?  I just blurted that out for no reason.  How about Pele?  Oh, Cy Young Award strikeout record.  Yeah, okay.  No Pele.  Pete Rose.  No Pele?  Jack Nicklaus.  Pete Rose.  Terry Bradshaw. 
[02:46:30]  Willie Stargell.  Nice.  The U.S. Olympic hockey team.  All right.  1980.  Mm-hmm.  I'm bored.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't say it was going to be a home run bit.  No, I'm the one who said let's look it up.  It was supposed to be a quick fact.  I'll take my responsibility.  There's Tiger Woods.  Tiger Woods a few times.  In 2000.  Yeah, a few times.  Willie Mays.  Curt Schilling.  Jackie Robinson should have won.  Old Bloody Heel.  Curt Schilling.  Clutch and Volbeat.  You listen to Volbeat? 
[02:47:00]  What?  Why not?  Blue Heeler says Clutch and Volbeat.  What is that?  I think I gave Clutch a chance.  I don't know.  The people that love Clutch really love Clutch.  Yeah.  A few people have said Volbeat is worth checking out.  I'm not into the Clutch.  Give me some Volbeat there, Travis.  Travis Noah, exactly who it is.  Thurman Munson?  No.  I know that my agent texted me with the worst suggestion ever.  Thurman Munson.  Why is he listening?  Pete said Thurman Munson.  Thurman Munson.  I guarantee you that's a fucking big N-O. 
[02:47:30]  Hopefully the year he died.  Well, again, if no Yankees are in there.  I think he was the Yankees.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Jesus.  What do you think?  Would he play for college sports for Ohio?  Right.  Jesus.  Boo, Pete.  He's not in as a pilot.  Yes, exactly.  Woody Allen, 74 years old today.  Good for Woody.  We referenced him today.  God bless Woody.  And this is the reason I'm doing these little factoids, because this one is, this one's rough. 
[02:48:00]  The first sex change operation, how many years ago today?  Let me think.  The first sex...  Christine Jorgensen, I believe, was the first, wasn't it?  Who's that?  Wasn't that the first sex change operation?  Was that Dr. Richards?  Dr. Renee Richards?  Dr. Renee Richards?  Or Christine Jorgensen?  I would say the first one, probably going back to the 40s.  Holy shit. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah?  You're still in the game.  All right.  It's got to be post-war.  No one's during the war, unless they got the dick blown off by a bouncing Betty.  I'd say 48, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4?  What happened?  It's in 1949, Anthony.  1942.  42?  57 years ago is the first sex change operation. 
[02:49:00]  I've got to know how they did it, 57 years ago.  Dick blown off in the Battle of Midway.  How do they do this?  Because they couldn't even take your appendix out in 1942 without leaving a scar all the  way up to your chin.  How do they do it?  Sick fucking...  This is it!  That's the guy?  Wait, that's a 1975 picture.  I'm reading.  All right.  Danny's reading.  I've got to see a picture of the first sex change operation.  So he's known as George.  And then 52, her story is in 1943.  What happened there? 
[02:49:30]  You know what?  She doesn't look any worse than half the fucking yentas that come into the city for their stupid  Broadway shows that you see on the Long Island Railroad app.  That's true.  God damn it.  I knew Caddy's nice.  What?  What?  CTS Coop is a fucking shit.  Oh!  All right.  We're all over the place now.  Now it's all about mileage, though.  Fuck that.  I want power.  That's right.  So what year was that fucking freak?  42.  42?  Yeah.  Died in 89. 
[02:50:00]  God.  But what do they do for this person?  Wow.  There must have been some weird kind of fucking...  How did they cut off the dick back in 42?  Did they cut it off or did they do the turn it inside out?  Because that's how they do it.  When did he die?  Not in 42.  That's the whole point of this.  In 42, they didn't...  They made labia's out of old tank parts.  That's what they did.  That's the point, though.  In 42, they didn't have all the technology they got today.  What's the difference between what they did to him and what the fucking Dr. Mengele was doing over there?  That's what I'm saying. 
[02:50:30]  Copenhagen.  Dan, if you got more info, let us know, because we're going to move on.  Where did Dummy have it done?  We don't know.  It wasn't in the United States, right?  Copenhagen.  Copenhagen?  In Copenhagen!  Christina Jorgensen.  Yeah.  Jorgensen?  We're going to Footer.  Footer?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  You know, I saw this list.  Jimmy brought up something about Dio yesterday, and I could not fucking believe that he was 67 years old.  So I came, there was a list in Revolver magazine, like a metal magazine, and it said 10 things that Dio is older than. 
[02:51:00]  I don't have them all in front of me, but like one was like the polio vaccine.  He's older than the fucking polio vaccine.  He's older than credit cards.  He's like fucking crazy shit.  He's an old dude.  I know, it's amazing that you don't think of him as being 67 because of the fucking, the way he still belts out songs, and he's still like a fucking, he's still a rock star.  I saw him on, there was a thing on, I don't know, some show, and he was with Heaven and Hell.  And the fucking dude sings. 
[02:51:30]  I mean, better than half of these kids that are out there right now in bands and shit.  You know what I mean?  His voice is just fucking perfect.  Yeah, we went and saw him when they shot the DVD here in Radio City about a year and a half, two years ago.  And he's fucking, he's flawless live.  He's flawless.  I saw him, I'm really sad to hear that he's sick.  I hope he's okay.  All right, boys.  See you.  Later, man.  Watch it out.  Hey, assholes, if you're sending an instant feedback, you've got to put your name so you get credit.  This guy writes, that's a hell of a way to dodge the draft.  Yeah.  Actually, it's Gordon from Jersey on that one.  Cut my jam off. 
[02:52:00]  That's a hell of a way to dodge the draft.  Why does Ian Halpern always look like he's taking a shit?  Someone said he looks like the gay Andrew Dice Clayton.  Oh, wow.  That is good.  He'll be in Thursday.  He should be in today if he's starting his fucking promotion.  All right, what do you want me to do?  Now I remember that guy.  You didn't remember him?  Why would I remember anybody?  You should start remembering people.  No.  No, he's busy.  They remember you.  You should remember them.  He's busy being sweet. 
[02:52:30]  It's easy to just meet them all over again.  No, I know when he came in, I'd be like, oh, that guy.  I'm just hard.  Remember we were going to beat the shit out of him, and then we'd just kind of like the guy.  Yeah, and then it was like, all right, he's all right.  After we went out of it about race.  Oh, fuck.  Are you showing a picture of a sex change operation?  From what year, though?  That looks old.  I want to see the early years.  That is old.  Oh, my God.  It's like a shrapnel wound.  What was that, Mary Pickford? 
[02:53:00]  America's sweetheart?  What year was Christina Jorgensen died?  89.  I wonder if she was considered heroic in the gay and lesbian community.  I think so.  Kind of an icon.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we do Caller Bombs Volume 2?  Oh, yay.  Here we go.  Let's hear what the callers had to contribute.  They like jumping down our throats fast enough, don't they?  They sure do.  Well, we turn the tables on you now and play the shit that you blurted out when you were 
[02:53:30]  on the phone with us.  Turnabout is fair play.  Yes.  I always say that.  Even when it doesn't apply.  Yeah.  We start with this one.  God.  All right.  Let's go to Andy.  Let's be horrible to live with.  Andy.  He just called in.  Is it him again?  Yeah.  You ever, hey guys, you ever notice how your producer fucking dies that you get real worried  about your job, so you got to tell them how much you hate vacation so they'll fire  your fucking ass? 
[02:54:00]  You ever notice when somebody's not too sure how a call's going to go, they throw in fuck  to hope it makes it stronger?  You ever notice how that doesn't work?  I remember that one.  Holy shit.  Sorry.  What happened?  I really stunk it up.  Just look at that.  The abominable snowman for those Christmas specials.  Oh, shit. 
[02:54:30]  That's the one I said.  I thought Chaz Bodo was here when she talked about it.  Yeah.  Jesus.  There are some...  She's a pig.  Hey, go get Mr. Gazzo.  Want to talk to him?  Jesus.  Horrendous.  Yeah, let's go on another caller bombing.  Anthony, we got Larry King on the line.  Larry!  Hey, this is Larry.  How are ya?  What's up, Larry?  Happy birthday, Jimmy. 
[02:55:00]  Thank you, fucking the Larry monster.  Larry monster.  Tyler, how important is the airline?  Oh, my God.  They're horrible.  Don't ruin our Larry King bit.  What happened?  Yeah, what happened on that one?  Yeah, we go with Steve in Wyoming, another caller bombing.  Yes.  Let's go to Steve in Wyoming.  Steve.  Hey, yes. 
[02:55:30]  Hey, I got a question.  What about if the kids were trying to get, like, over the wall, like in East Berlin?  They were just building the balloon to get over the wall.  Wow.  How about building a balloon to get over the crater?  That bomb just left.  Holy shit.  He said, burn Lynn.  Burn Lynn.  He started falling apart.  I heard that one.  Burn Lynn.  I love when they get nervous.  It is the best, and a caller just really loses it. 
[02:56:00]  Falls apart.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Burn Lynn.  Got another?  Yeah, Jeremy in Georgia.  Let's go to Jeremy in Georgia.  Jeremy.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I've got the ultimate thing that will make you look like a dork as a midlife crisis  statement.  A shooting spree.  Nothing says, I want to get these fuckers back like a shooting spree, but in essence, 
[02:56:30]  you just make yourself look like an asshole.  Now you just ruin, like, a thousand billion people's lives.  Yeah, he's going and going, hoping to get traction, but it's just...  A thousand billion people's lives.  A thousand billion lives.  Yeah, it's very bad.  That is fucking...  Is that bad?  Spiraling out of control.  Would that be bad?  When a plane is plummeting, that's when the wings are ripped off.  Wow, that was a bad one, man. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that one gave me a douche chill.  The other ones made me chuckle.  That one kind of douche chilled me a bit.  All right, let's do the next one.  Yeah.  Is it an egg-shaped penis?  Egg-shaped.  Of all the things, did Mark from Ork live in your penis?  Bruce.  Yeah, is it true that your head is shaped like Club Soda Kenny's head?  Your head.  No, it's your penis.  It's shaped like Club Soda Kenny's head. 
[02:57:30]  I already said that.  Another one for the bombs.  Save that one, Travis.  And he repeated my joke, that fuck.  Yeah.  Head, head.  I don't know how to...  Head, head.  Fucking panicky Pete's completely collapsed on the phone.  Really do.  Top ten searches for 2009 on Yahoo.  Michael Jackson.  Of course that's the number one search of 2000.  How do they know there won't be something that happens in December? 
[02:58:00]  How can they make that announcement?  What if a shit-shaped alien lands?  Why does it have to be shit-shaped?  For whatever reason, that's what...  Like, years ago, they would have said cigars, but now we just realize he's a shit-shaped alien.  And he has little shit feet.  It was shit-shaped.  It hovered over my house.  That's right.  And the flies think he's God.  Jesus.  Caroline's, huh, Jimmy?  It's tonight, uh, no, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. 
[02:58:30]  Where are you?  I might go by tonight.  No, it's Thursday through Sunday.  Thursday through Sunday.  Doing my Christmas show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  I want to go.  I perform with a Santa hat.  Aw.  You know what?  I do.  Ho, ho, ho!  After every joke, you make my set longer.  Here we go.  Top ten searches.  We'll get back to the bombs in a second.  Uh, according to Yahoo for 2009.  Ten.  What is that one? 
[02:59:00]  RuneScape.  What's RuneScape, Ant?  It's RuneScape.  I don't know what RuneScape is.  It's a game?  It's a video game?  I have no idea.  No one knows what RuneScape is?  Are you serious?  Let's see.  Ew, RuneScape.  RuneScape is a role-playing game.  Oh, really?  Oh, thank God we don't know what it is.  Exactly.  Yeah.  What is it, like EverQuest?  I would assume it's probably some kind of fairy.  Wow, look, they completely rip off EverQuest's, like, look and everything. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a little, you know, role-play game.  You don't play EverQuest anymore, do you, Ant?  Uh, no.  But you know something?  I still have my character, and I still pay for it every month.  I pay for the subscription.  I've had that character since 1999.  Wow.  What's it called?  It's been ten years already?  I forgot his name.  Oh, great.  No, I think it was, um, what the hell is the name?  Is your character just somewhere out there that people could kind of run across?  It's out in virtue.  It's sitting.  It's like sitting there, just kind of sitting. 
[03:00:00]  How long have you been sitting?  Keith plays every so often.  On your character?  Yeah.  How long have you been sitting?  For months now, I'm sure.  That's creepy.  But it's been there for years.  That one character's just been running around.  It's like AI shit.  Yeah.  Do people still play?  Yeah, there's still a lot of people on.  EverQuest?  Yeah.  People went to World of Warcraft, but, um...  Is it a better game?  Uh, World of Warcraft?  No.  It's a dumbed-down version.  They dumbed down EverQuest too much for me.  That's why I stopped, like, playing it a lot.  I want to play D&D. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  D&D sucks.  That's for the real fucking geeks.  Number nine, NASCAR.  NASCAR.  It was a big search, uh, this year.  Kim Kardashian, number eight.  Why?  Do you like the Kim Kardashian?  I wouldn't know her if she walked in here and threw her tits in my face and said,  Hi, I'm Kimmy K.  You know who Kim Kardashian is.  I know her name.  I would not know what she looks like.  You're lying.  Why would?  I honestly don't.  You're lying.  You're lying.  You're lying.  You have to be lying.  Danny's a big fan of her ass. 
[03:01:00]  I'm not saying I wouldn't sniff it after a good tinkle.  Ew.  Well, for you.  Glad my fucking agent stopped texting me.  Thurman Munson should be the last text you fucking send.  Jimmy, you really don't know...  Thurman Munson.  You really don't know who Kim Kardashian is?  I know who she is, but I don't know what she looks like.  Right there.  Stop.  Oh, yeah, I've seen her.  Nice tits.  She's got big fake tits, big fake head, big fake fuck.  Shut up.  Who'd she fuck in the, uh...  A father was a fucking shill for O.J. 
[03:01:30]  Good he's dead.  Oh, shit.  You knew what he did.  He knew what he did.  Oh, shit.  She's a nice ass.  He knew what he did.  And now look at what your daughters are doing from heaven or from hell, wherever you are.  You could look up and see right up your daughter's vagina.  Her vagina.  That ass is a little...  It's a little big.  A little big.  Danny says no right.  Danny likes it.  That's a little big.  That dude doesn't fly out of it.  Give me a picture with the red dude.  Dude doesn't fly out of it, though.  It's a big fucking ass.  That's too big.  Is she part black?  No, she's a...  What is this?  She's like... 
[03:02:00]  I forget.  Where are those system of a down people from?  Greek?  They're from La Calatia?  No.  I can't remember where they're from.  Derek says Turkey.  D-Boy says Turkey.  No, it's not Turkey.  No, it's not Turkey.  D-Boy's a dummy.  He's stupid.  I can't remember.  He's stupid.  D-Boy's not going to go see Brothers.  It's Lionsgate.  Lionsgate.  We know.  We all know now.  Yeah.  Is that ass too big, eh?  I can't tell.  Some pictures it looks good, and some pictures it's too big.  No.  No, that's a nice...  I like a...  I'm the type of guy who likes a nice deep crack. 
[03:02:30]  I love...  I swear to God, I love a good deep crack.  Like, I like to be all...  If I'm touching the asshole and the cheeks close around my hand, I want it to be covered  up to my wrist.  Jesus, that's a deep crack.  I like a fucking deep crack.  You should go ghetto, though, man.  Ghetto booty.  That's funny.  We'll get that job done for you.  A nice deep crack.  I want to go and be humiliated and embarrassed by your crack and lose things in it.  Anybody watch the Kardashian show?  No.  With Bruce Jenner?  No.  I feel so fucking sorry for that guy. 
[03:03:00]  He was an Olympic hero.  No.  And his own family don't give a shit.  I look forward to meeting him.  Bruce Jenner is a fucking American hero, and he's putting up with these fucking things.  And that wife of his, she's a nightmare.  Is she?  I'm talking to nobody because you guys don't know the show, so I'll shut up.  No, but I should hear this.  You should watch Growing Up with Whatever the Fuck the Show is called.  Just to be annoyed.  And to feel sorry for Bruce Jenner.  What else is on that search list there, Danny? 
[03:03:30]  Danny's just into the Kim Kardashian pictures.  She's delicious.  American Idol.  Naruto.  What's that?  Number six.  And you know what Naruto is?  I've never heard of Naruto.  Danny, you're pretty good at this stuff.  I know, but it must be another role-playing game because I've never heard of it.  Is it?  Naruto.  Let's see.  Japanese.  Is it anime?  Anime stinks.  Anime porn.  You don't like anime either?  No. 
[03:04:00]  What do you like?  I like real porn.  Anime.  I am bad!  What a big twiton girl!  Bunch of crap.  It's more than that.  It stinks.  Oh, god damn, Jimmy!  Oh, stop.  What is Naruto?  It's an ongoing Japanese manga series.  Okay, whatever.  Armenia.  Yeah, Armenian.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what she is.  Armenian?  Yeah.  But is the country Armenia?  Armenia.  Armenia? 
[03:04:30]  Sure.  How the fuck is this?  It might be our Nicene now.  Well, someone misspelled this, then.  Adrian.  Oh, my god.  That was bad.  Wow.  Adrian.  I bombed badly.  Adriana, whatever the fuck your name is, go.  Yo, yo, yo, yo.  What's your name?  Adrian.  Hey, Mark.  Hey, what's up, bro?  How much, Ben?  Oh, my god.  Yeah, they're Armenian.  Armenian.  I meant to say Armenian.  But someone spelled it A-R-M-A-N-I-A.  M-E.  I don't know.  It's like New Greece, you know, that type of area there. 
[03:05:00]  All right.  The asshole?  That type of area there.  Yeah.  Of course.  Any time Greek comes up.  They like block cheese and ass fucking.  Big block of cheese and a cock in the shitter.  Lovely culture.  Hell's a way to live.  Yeah.  Fucking hairy knuckles and a cock in the rear.  What would you like?  I'd like a good ass fucking and a block of cheese to go with that. 
[03:05:30]  They'd probably eat the cheese to try to keep the cocks out.  You know what I mean?  Just keep you all clogged up so you don't have to take the cock.  The cock.  Oh, shit.  Give me some of those other searches there, Danny.  Britney Spears, number five.  Big search in 2009.  Fucking alternative number four, Thumbs McGillicuddy.  You hate Megan Fox because of her dumb thumb?  I love Megan Fox, but she has little fucking frog toe thumbs.  I'd still want to make the Fonzie symbol at me while she's shit in my face.  Don't get me wrong. 
[03:06:00]  If I get out of your mind, man.  I'd like her to squat over my face and yell, hey, call me Cuntingham.  And drop a deuce on my nose.  I'm tired.  Her thumb is pretty bad.  Let me see.  She's not perfect.  That's great.  She isn't perfect.  That's all I'd do is fuck her and yell about her thumbs.  Put gloves on those or I can't cum.  Wow, that is weird.  They're bulbous.  Yeah, she has a weird... 
[03:06:30]  Damn.  Why is she showing them?  Fix that.  Yeah, she's like...  Got her hand up by her face and...  I don't know.  She'd just keep both of them firmly in her asshole at all times.  Or in her ears and go...  She should always be doing the Godfather face at the end.  Boy, people really picked up on her stubby thumbs.  How could you not?  She's perfect.  They're everywhere.  My dick would never get hard with those thumbs in the vicinity.  Really?  No, she'd have to leave her arms out the window.  Oh, I fucked her. 
[03:07:00]  Exactly.  She has opie thumbs.  I have the same fucking thumb as Megan Fox.  Oh.  Yeah.  Only on my left hand, though.  That's what makes it really fun.  I'm like, my right one is normal.  Looks like I was in some kind of...  I fucking...  You are in a weird genetic accident.  Genetic.  The tip of my left thumb was cut off, but not my right.  Got left in the womb.  What the fuck?  Where is it?  I need it.  Other searches.  We make fun of Sam all the time, but the WWE, third most searched word according to Yahoo in the year 2009. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then you got that Twilight bullshit.  Oh.  Number one.  You know what this Twilight movie is about?  I finally did a little learning.  Yeah.  Get some chick in love with some vampire guy.  But they can't have sex or she becomes the vampire.  Yes.  And that's why they got a fucking problem.  Oh, so they're always like, oh, when will they get together?  So they're preaching teenage girls not to have sex, basically.  Why doesn't she just have sex and be a vampire?  Well, that's the confusion in these fucking movies. 
[03:08:00]  She wants to have the sex, but if she does, she becomes a vampire.  Vampires never seem to mind that they're vampires after they're vampires.  And they're trying to figure it out.  He's like, he wants to stick it in her ass, but he's not sure if that will make her a vampire or just turn her into a bat.  He's afraid he'll fuck her in the doo-doo hole and she'll just grow wings and hang upside down.  And they'll be like, oh, shit.  I really fucked this one up.  He should have done some research and fucked her fatty first right in her backside. 
[03:08:30]  I think that's what the movie's about.  Something like that.  Something like that.  It has some kind of virginity thing going on.  Oh, man.  All right.  And then number one was what?  Did we do number one?  I don't remember.  Michael.  Oh, yeah.  Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go back to the bombs.  Oh, Lady Trucker.  He's got a nice fucking bomb here.  Sure did.  I want to sing my version of immigrant songs.  Shut up, Lady Trucker. 
[03:09:00]  Jesus.  Oh, this should be really good.  What's her version?  Yeah, let's hear it, LT.  Good morning.  Hi.  We got that part.  Okay.  Bad morning, then.  What do you want to sing, Lady Trucker?  Oh, I want to sing my version of the immigrant song.  Go ahead.  Draw, please.  Go ahead.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Come on.  That's what our seat is saying. 
[03:09:30]  No, her mouth is just open going, ah, feed me.  Ah, I'm hungry.  Is that it, Lady Trucker?  That's it, sweetie.  So far, so good.  That was terrific.  Should end with squealing tires.  I know.  Sirens.  That's her going off like a Thelma and Louise type of suicide.  Very good.  She sure hangs in there, even though we really beat the shit out of her.  Dude, we're all in a fucking silly mood right now because, you know how I was bitching at 
[03:10:00]  that guy because he spelled Armenian wrong?  Right?  It's Chris from Ohio.  He goes, sorry, I spelled Armenian wrong.  I was doing 70 in an 80,000-pound truck.  That's fantastic.  He's texting.  And he had a fucking Texas apology as he still drives an 80,000-pound truck.  It's probably an 8,000-pound truck, but fucking nervous, fucked up again. 
[03:10:30]  As an extra zero.  Bitching.  All right.  Fuck it.  Larry King, again, made dollar bombs.  Larry!  Mind if me and Michael speak Italian?  Hello.  Hey.  Hi, Larry King.  Could you explain why you're the biggest man in that village and there's all these low-legged  women walking around?  Okay.  High five.  That was Larry King?  Yes, it was.  You're going to...  Hey, just think of it this way. 
[03:11:00]  Think of the upside.  You'll definitely hear yourself saying that again at some point once Travis gets done with  volume two.  Congratulations, sir.  You know when I gave my twilight theory or my synopsis ant?  Yes.  I guess I was completely wrong.  Really?  I can't be wrong.  I got a microphone in front of me.  Yeah.  Trish, what did I get wrong about twilight?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Trish.  You know that's a real fat girl's name, don't you? 
[03:11:30]  Trish.  Oh, you know, and I am chubby and proud.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Trish the dish.  That's all that's left in front of me.  You guys totally got it wrong about the twilight.  You guys totally got it wrong about the twilight.  Are you done?  How are you done?  No, I bet you are, though.  I'm sorry, Trish. 
[03:12:00]  What?  Yes, go ahead, Trish.  We're sorry.  Okay, you guys are in a mood today.  It's awesome.  Okay, so you totally got it wrong.  Everybody want a piece of my chicken.  Suck and fry.  And hang on.  Give it.  Give it.  Yes, Trish.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  It's not that if he fucks her, she turns into a vampire.  It's he's so strong that if he fucks her, she might die. 
[03:12:30]  Like Superman.  Oh, so Superman had to give up his powers so he could fuck disgusting Lois Lane.  So basically, he has to put her feet together and fuck her feet.  Is that what happens?  For a small fold, yes.  I wasn't that off then.  He's the fucking crook of her arm.  Are they virgins or not?  He is not, of course, but she is.  That's what I said.  She's a fucking virgin.  And if she has sex, then something awful will happen. 
[03:13:00]  Well, yeah, but it's a Mormon writer, so they don't have sex until they're married.  Yeah, I know.  It is a Mormon writer.  That's what all the books are about.  Oh, Trish.  And this Twilight thing started as a dumb dream, this broadhead.  One dream wakes up, starts writing, and now she's a fucking billionaire.  Oh, boy, is she?  They're number one, two, three on the list.  For New York Times bestseller.  I mean, they stay on the fucking list.  Start as a dream.  We all have dumb dreams.  We sure do.  Start writing down your dreams and start writing books.  I had a dream that there was a hurricane in the studio. 
[03:13:30]  And then that happened.  Oh, please, not another bad one.  All right, Trish.  Thank you.  Okay, boy.  The asshole of God.  Let's say hi to Mike in Hoboken.  Horrible.  Mike.  Jimmy, this is with the utmost love and respect, but you covered up for a horrendous bomb with  your ass.  When?  Yeah.  When they said that Kim Kardashian was Armenian and you said, oh, maybe she's our nice-y-an. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, I even said after.  I said I bombed and nobody heard it.  You guys want to hear it?  Yeah.  Oh, Travis, you got it?  Yeah.  Is the country Armenia?  Armenia.  Armenia?  Sure.  How the fuck is he?  It might be our nice-y-an now.  Well, someone misspelled this thing.  What happened?  I love you, Jimmy.  The oof is the best part of that.  The oof, it just goes, oof.  It was horrible.  Wow, that's a good bomb. 
[03:14:30]  It was a real bloodbath.  What the fuck are we listening to in here?  I have to.  What happened?  I have to get under the vent so the air blows out of me.  Jimmy.  They're bad today.  There's something inside of you.  It's goodness.  No, it's the devil.  There's goodness in me.  The devil is in you.  Goodness is in me.  Satan.  Satan.  Wow.  Another caller bombing.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Mike in Massachusetts.  Mike.  Top of the morning. 
[03:15:00]  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What's up, man?  Hey.  A little early, like a half hour ago, Ant Colbo, the secret blower,  and Ope was like, oh, I guess I am.  There you go.  Yeah, yeah, the secret blower.  There it is, yeah.  Also, I figured out why Ant likes Patrice.  Patrice's name is Pat O'Neill.  That's not black at all.  Should have quit while you were waiting.  All right.  Too late.  What happened?  Yeah.  And finally, our last caller bombing on volume two here. 
[03:15:30]  Let's go to Gil in Connecticut.  Gil.  Hey.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  I don't remember the other morning.  I crashed and burned.  Nope.  But that freaking Randy Spears, he sounds like a fog going from hell.  I hope he hits a freaking iceberg.  Yeah.  I guess he's popular.  Oh, boy.  I love those from hell jokes.  He sounds like a what? 
[03:16:00]  I'm sorry, I'm corny, but you guys are cool.  He sounds like a what from hell?  I like a freaking fog going from hell.  I hit a train, he's been a cool, I hit a rock.  I liked it.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  You sound like a caller from Toilet.  There you go.  And can I say from the record, we're back now.  Fucking Gil is a horrid name. 
[03:16:30]  Who the?  Why are you going after?  Just stinks.  What do you want to name your kid after?  I don't know.  How about a fish's breathing apparatus?  Fucking sucks.  Yeah, my friend Gil, his fucking, his dad, Finns McGillicuddy.  Finns McGillicuddy.  What a shitty name. 
[03:17:00]  Gil.  Gil.  I'd rather be called Eyelashes Norton.  It's my brother, Dorsal Finn.  I never thought of that.  Oh, it's fucking...  Fish's breathing apparatus.  Oh, it stinks, Gil.  But you're only one of them, so you're worthless.  Hey, Lung, call me tomorrow.  Oh, it's a fucking abysmal name.  Let's go home. 
[03:17:30]  I'm tired.  We'll get out of here.  I'm tired of it.  I'm a motherfucker.  Can you promote that show of yours, and then Travis hit something?  I got only Thursday through Sunday, Caroline's this week.  And one announcement for my Borgata dates, Friday, Saturday of January 15th, 16th, I think.  There will not be a third show added.  There usually is every year.  We say there's not.  But there was a mistake by the promoter.  There will only be Friday, Saturday at the Borgata in January. 
[03:18:00]  There will be no Sunday show for Martin Luther King weekend.  I'm saying that there's going to be a big uprising.  Oh, really?  Nobody gives a turd.  All right. </pre>
