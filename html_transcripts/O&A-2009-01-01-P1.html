<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a comedic segment focused on Hallmark’s bereavement cards. The hosts ridiculed the cards' tone and placement in stores, with caller Travis providing specific retail information. This transitioned into a discussion about supermarket shelf space competitiveness, followed by a satirical reading of several Hallmark cards.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to obesity, sparked by a listener’s story about an overweight child,  and compared to one of the host's weight loss journeys.  A call-in segment about favorite snack foods followed, culminating in a lengthy, highly offensive, and verbally abusive phone call with a caller named Heather the Feather, involving multiple participants in a barrage of insults. The segment concluded with further discussion on exercise regimens and the hosts' personal fitness experiences, including commentary on the perceived masculinity of various activities.

Next, the show featured a discussion of the hosts’ yoga experiences, specifically the awkwardness of flatulence and a yoga instructor's shirtless display.  This segued into a studio visit by Steve the Whistler, an international grand champion whistler. They discussed his career, his album "Broadway and Beyond" (describing the album cover in detail), and played several whistling pieces, repeatedly interrupted by technical difficulties with the CD player.  Listener calls and discussions on whistling techniques ensued, further hampered by technical problems.

Following the Whistler, the hosts recounted attending Derek Jeter's Turn 2 Foundation 10th Anniversary Dinner. They detailed Jimmy Norton’s obsessive pursuit of celebrity photos, including his preparation and his assistant Roland's involvement. Anecdotes about prior photo-taking adventures with various musicians and difficulties securing pictures, particularly with Robert Plant, were shared.  The segment concluded with descriptions of Jimmy’s emotional state and ultimately successful (though stressful) attempt to get a photo signed by Jeter.

This led into a detailed account of Jimmy Norton's intensely negative experience at the Jeter event. Norton recounted numerous failed attempts to get autographs and photos with Yankee players, expressing extreme frustration with their perceived dismissiveness, especially towards Jeter, whom he called a "phony."  He criticized several players (Tino Martinez, Ron Guidry), while praising Jason Giambi's positive interaction.  Anthony Cumia's late arrival due to a heavy downpour and his amusement at Norton's misery were noted.  The segment highlighted the contrast between Norton's experience and that of female fans, who seemed to receive preferential treatment.  The exorbitant cost of the XM Radio table ($20,000) was mentioned, emphasizing the irony of Norton's treatment.  Norton's interactions with Jim LaRritz and Spike Lee were also discussed, portraying both as indifferent.  The segment ended with Norton's critical assessment of the gift bag and auction, culminating in a humorous rant, a call-in sharing a similar negative experience with a sports figure, and further discussion of Norton's anger towards Jeter and athletes in general.

The show concluded with a phone call from a listener named Irene, discussing the death of her boyfriend in their bathroom. Opie and Anthony engaged in a heated exchange with Irene, marked by sarcastic comments, insults, and accusations from both sides.  Irene detailed her boyfriend's sudden heart failure, while the hosts interrupted repeatedly using crude and sexually suggestive language.  The call ended with apologies from the hosts and lingering tension.  The hosts' laughter throughout the call, particularly during moments concerning her boyfriend's death, contributed to the segment’s controversial nature.

[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:00]  We're in the middle of talking about these new Hallmark greeting cards for some twisted things that happen to you and your loved ones. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, just some tragic events or lifestyle issues.  Anthony nailed it.  Anthony nailed it, too.  If you're going to get into one of these touchy subjects, get a card that's blank inside and write a little note.  Some stationery.  Buy some stationery.  But you need Hallmark to find the words to show your sympathy because your friend has cancer.  It's kind of a cop-out. 
[00:05:00]  It's kind of a cop-out.  Oh, the cancer section.  Nah, this one doesn't quite do it.  How big is that, too?  It's not like Mother's Day, that section, where it's real big.  I'm sure it's just like a little section.  It's hiding card point.  It's hiding in the shadows.  Yeah.  Are those cards all together under some kind of special...  Who bought them all?  You know, that's what we've got to figure out.  Where are the cancer cards?  What are the cards right next to the cancer cards?  Is it the gay card?  Are they all like special interest cards all in one key together?  Gay cards right next to Happy Anniversary. 
[00:05:30]  Miscarriage cards right next to You're Expecting.  Well, you don't want...  No, you don't want to put...  You don't want the miscarriage card next to the one first year card.  Right.  The card that's shaped like the number one with a candle on it.  Dude, can we go down to the store and rearrange the cards?  I want the miscarriage cards right next to the birthday cards announcing that you're kids, too.  First birthday.  Oh, that's horrid.  Travi? 
[00:06:00]  Hold on, hold on.  I was only joking.  See, now it's okay.  I was only joking.  See, now it's okay.  I was only joking.  See, now it's okay.  I was only joking.  See, now it's okay.  Still.  Yeah.  What's up, Travis?  Travis?  Yes.  These cards now, where were they?  They were in a section all by themselves.  All by themselves.  Yes.  And were they prominently displayed?  No, they were actually in the back of the store.  In the back of the store.  Yeah, because they don't want these cards creeping anyone out.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be happy stuff when you're buying cards. 
[00:06:30]  You ever go to the back of a store to like the far corner and see the crap they got there?  Garbage.  They haven't been able to get rid of.  If you know anything about marketing, all the really good stuff is right there when you enter a store.  Yeah.  But if you want to have fun, go to the back of these stores and look in the far corners.  I saw a show once where they were talking about supermarkets, and you don't even realize how cutthroat that business is.  The guys that supply like Del Monte and the name brand groceries, they will fight with other people for shelf space that's at eye level. 
[00:07:00]  The eye level shelf space, that's your prime real estate in supermarkets.  And there have been like payola issues in supermarkets where the suppliers actually kick back money to the supermarket to have that placement.  Where's the John Jeff section?  Way low?  The lowest shelf?  That's like the lowest shelf that's real thin, too.  It's like only like six inches high, so you can't even see it. 
[00:07:30]  Never mind reach for it.  It's like where the Goya beans are.  And we don't feel like explaining the John Jeff thing today.  On the floor.  We'll explain on another day for the newbies.  How do you find a card?  I'm sorry your son is gay and the host of an awful show.  That's going to be a...  Enjoy your trip to Thailand.  Let's say hi to Inbred in Ohio.  Inbred.  Hey, what's up, y'all?  What's up, Inbred?  Hey, instead of a card for the gays, how about a singing telegram? 
[00:08:00]  You have AIDS.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex put you here.  It isn't clear, but what we're certain of is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  It's not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  It's not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  It's not HIV, but really full-blown AIDS. 
[00:08:30]  I'm sorry.  I wish it was something less serious.  But it's AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  All right.  That's a fantastic song. 
[00:09:00]  I love that one.  Jimmy, you want to pick another card?  These are the brand-new Hallmark cards.  Oh, I don't know.  Real cards.  Pick a card, any card.  There you go.  This one can't be good.  These cards are just uncomfortable for everybody.  Why would you send these cards?  I don't know.  Yeah, it should be just personal drop-by with some cookies and cake. 
[00:09:30]  Um, well, certainly not Similac.  Oh, this is a light purple card.  Any picture on the cover?  Let me see the cover there.  It's like a little dark purple, like, flower outline.  Yeah, it's like an outline of a flower with this blue, like, almost light at the top where the petals are.  Yeah.  And here's what it says.  It is difficult for others to understand the depth of the loss we feel. 
[00:10:00]  For the child?  How about three inches of toilet water?  Oh.  How's that for a depth?  I was only joking.  All right, it's okay.  I was only joking.  All right, it's okay.  Oh, they mean by depth.  They mean the sorrow.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I was only joking.  I don't want to read this one.  For the depth of the loss we feel.  For the child who will never be born.  Oh.  You would actually send this card to somebody?  Or you send these cards out to everybody? 
[00:10:30]  That's horrible.  The poor parents are, like, you know, going through a tough time and that's got to come in the mail?  Oh, what do I get?  A little card?  Oh, this might take my mind off of.  Ah!  Usually when you go to your mailbox and right around your birthday or Christmas and you see what's obvious, a greeting card, you get more excited inside.  Hey, what's this?  You want to open up cards and read this crap?  No.  There's more.  It says, it's difficult for others to understand the depth of the loss we feel. 
[00:11:00]  For a child who will never be born.  Even those closest to us may wonder why we can't seem to get over it.  Lovely friends.  Really?  Get over it.  Uh, what they don't understand, this is, you open the card and it's like a light, uh, turquoise inside.  What they don't understand is how we already, oh.  How we what?  Let's move on from this bit.  Ah.  That's a good one.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  This needs to be read today.  What is Hallmark doing? 
[00:11:30]  They need money this bad that they got cards like this?  What they don't understand is how we already loved that little one.  Aw.  And love never ends.  Oh, I didn't know it was an audio card.  You open it up and it's an audio card.  Yeah, it's the thing of the future.  They put a chip in there.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Though the dreams and plans we had must be gently laid to rest, we each must take our own time and in our own way find the strength to let hope be a part of us once again. 
[00:12:00]  I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  It's all right now.  If you need someone to talk to, I'm here.  That is twisted.  I was only joking.  I was only joking. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, okay.  It's all right.  It's just a joke.  You guys can understand.  It's just a joke.  I was only joking.  There you go. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  It's fine.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The man.  Another one.  I was only joking.  Yeah, wait a minute.  Okay. 
[00:13:30]  Here it is.  The final mix.  No, it's not the final mix.  The second, hold on in.  Not the final mix.  I'll help you.  After the drum thing, give it to me.  Okay.  Okay.  Ah! 
[00:14:00]  Damn!  I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  It's all right.  Just...  Oh, brother.  Look, the point is...  What is the point?  The point is...  There's no point to this. 
[00:14:30]  Look, we'll agree to disagree, okay?  All right, let's just agree to disagree.  We'll agree to disagree.  We're really pissing off some people right now, and I don't blame them.  But the reality is, why...  What?  Okay, well, let's see.  All right.  Oh.  Ah.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:15:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we're all joking.  Ah!  Ah!  It's just a joke.  All right, listen. 
[00:15:30]  All right, listen.  Razzle-dazzle!  I just wanted to mix it up a little bit, sorry.  I just wanted to...  Whatever.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:16:00]  You're gonna be okay!  All right, look, let's...  Hold on, do I have to direct this?  It's gonna go...  All right.  Am I in on this one?  Yes, you are.  All right.  Okay.  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:16:30]  Ah!  You're fired.  You're not suspended.  You're not on temporary leave.  You're fired.  All right, listen.  It's all Hallmark's fault.  Oh, wait, wait.  I was only joking.  All right.  I was only joking.  It's a joke.  It's fine.  The point is...  That Hallmark is the twisted one here.  Can you dig that?  I'd do the chooker.  Ah! 
[00:17:00]  They actually have cards for these...  Yeah.  ...these awful things.  All right.  How about we pick another?  I don't want to.  All right.  All right.  Well, maybe we should get rid of the other card.  Yeah.  That's true.  John did want more sound effects.  Well, he got his sound effects.  There you go, Johnny boy.  All right.  Can we just...  Can I read this one really fast just to get rid of it? 
[00:17:30]  Get it out of the way?  Get throw away?  Yeah.  Get this one out of the way.  Throw this one in the garbage with the other one.  Just clear the list.  All right.  It says,  I have known you in my dreams, little one,  and there you will forever be loved.  Saying goodbye to what might have been the hopes and dreams that grew more real every day  brings in added sadness in the depth of pain,  wishing you gentle comfort for your sorrow.  So, holy crap.  So, that ends that subject. 
[00:18:00]  There's a card for that.  Thanks to Hallmark.  All right, Anthony.  I got a couple more to choose from.  Fantastic.  Listen.  Listen.  Okay, listen.  I see the last three here.  Okay, listen.  Listen.  No, I'm not kidding.  All right, listen.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  We really want a lot of listeners to our radio show.  But if you're a female, I got a suggestion for you.  Wake up.  You might want to go somewhere else for another minute or two. 
[00:18:30]  Because the last three are a doozy.  Boy, I wonder what the pink card is.  Here you go, Ed.  I was only joking. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Only joking.  All right, why don't you pick one?  Let me pick a new one.  Thank God we only have three of these Hallmark cards left.  All right.  I'm picking this one.  Oh, Christ.  No.  You picked the pink one.  Why did I have to pick the pink one?  Women, women, women, women.  Wake up.  Move on.  There's nothing to see here right now.  Move on.  Just move on.  Please leave. 
[00:19:30]  We're telling you to leave.  Kiss my fat ass.  No, we're telling you to leave right now.  All right.  It's a pink card.  It's a pink card.  Yes.  We'll save the other two for later in the show.  Because we can't.  All right.  This is a real Hallmark card, by the way.  Because people are writing, oh, and you guys are making these up.  No.  You can go to your card store and find these exact cards.  This collection is called Journeys.  It's encouraging words along life's way.  Okay.  So whether, you know, life, those three of those curve balls. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, boy.  Do they have one for that?  I have them, but they curve.  You're a fighter, a survivor, an inspiration.  Oh, no.  And this is kind of ironic.  Keep that close to your heart now and always, since something else isn't close to your heart anymore.  I was only joking. 
[00:20:30]  Is that all the card says?  Yeah, that's it.  It's a simple.  It obviously is for breast cancer.  It's got the pink.  Very subdued on the pink card.  You can see the pink ribbon.  That is the sign of support.  I, uh, sorry.  Can't think of anything funny.  Nope.  Funny just slips by me on this. 
[00:21:00]  Yep.  You know, my pop-up card idea is just going to go by the wayside.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The card is very lopsided.  Oh, it's not.  It's perfectly even both sides.  Look at it closely.  No, man.  You can't even put that one on your mantle.  It keeps falling over.  You know how you got to give it to the person?  Like this.  All right, listen.  Only this part. 
[00:21:30]  All right, listen.  Let's leave.  All right, listen.  That was only joking.  Okay.  It's all right.  It's just a joke.  Sorry.  Everything's good now.  I tried to put it back together.  All right.  Listen.  Half a card.  Oh, God.  That is horrible.  Well, we got two more cards left.  Have one for crying husband?  We have two cards left. 
[00:22:00]  Yes, two cards left.  Thank God.  That we'll get to after the break.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, God.  That's horrible.  You can't.  Oh, my God.  People are making up their own cards, and they're really awful.  Yeah, well.  There's other stuff to do, too, but I forgot already.  What?  What?  What?  What do you got?  This one says, um, it's a sympathy card.  All right.  It says, uh, in deepest sympathy, I'm sorry to hear your daughter, a... 
[00:22:30]  I thought the beef took care of...  Isn't it?  You open a card.  It's a pop-up card.  You open it, and there's, like, a nice suburban house, and a black python just falls out of  the daughter's window on the card.  Isn't it an audio card?  Don't you have the audio of that card there, Anthony?  Oh.  You might...  Hey, where are the white women at?  No, that ain't it.  No, that ain't it.  You have the audio...  Of course I do.  ...of the audio card of the card you just read? 
[00:23:00]  You'll do what we tell you to do, you dirty, low-down slut.  It is not a sin to get rid of a dirty stain.  Wasting your time with a black...  Huh.  A negro.  Oh, my God.  Anyone else see Jim Carrey doing the David Caruso bit on Letterman?  Like, six months after the whole world did the bit?  Hello, exactly!  Yeah.  How does he get away with that?  And everyone's laughing and laughing and laughing like it hasn't been done by pretty much everybody 
[00:23:30]  at this point.  I mean, everybody.  And he walks onto Letterman with the glasses and does the whole David Caruso one-liner bit.  Yeah, it's pretty...  pretty hack now.  It's one of the videos that is...  It's one of the top videos on, I think, YouTube this morning.  It's sweeping the nation.  All right, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Lots to do today, so get us out of here for a bit.  Hey, guys.  Opie and Anthony, we're away.  This is the best they could come up with.  See you after the holidays.  I just read that.  Yeah, that was very red.  That's okay, though. 
[00:24:00]  It should be like, you know, hey, we're away.  This is about, like, the best they could come up with.  But see, you missed the best there.  We'll see you after...  But it sounds natural.  Okay.  Try to sound...  I actually acted that.  Try to sound natural for this next one.  Okay.  Yeah, that's the story of the British officials.  They want to take away a kid who's a big fatty.  Look at this big fat kid.  And the mother said she didn't think she was doing anything wrong.  Well, what was she feeding the kid, Lord?  Apparently everything.  It depends what she was feeding the kid, whether they should take the kid away. 
[00:24:30]  She was obviously feeding him too much.  He's, what, eight and he's over 200 pounds?  Yeah, he's a giant, big, fat kid.  I think...  Big, fat kid.  I think 220.  I bet the little playmates call him fatso in school.  Hey, fatso, you want to eat my lunch, fatso?  And they punch him in the stomach just to look at his face.  But why do they want to take the kid away?  Child abuse.  For what?  Feeding him too much.  But what is she feeding him?  If it's just normal crap?  No, it's like cakes and foo. 
[00:25:00]  The kid isn't on a diet.  The kid shouldn't be that fat.  It's not some kind of a stupid glandular problem.  And if it is, you should, you know, have him just eating a celery stick.  But some people are just meant to be fat.  I don't think so.  You think everyone could be fat?  I think there's probably five people on this planet that have to be fat.  Everyone else can probably be skinny.  Not skinny, but not fat.  I look at our own Steve.  Not obese. 
[00:25:30]  I look at our own Steve and it proves it.  Some people are meant to be big.  No, Steve's a big guy, but he's not fat anymore.  Steve isn't fat.  But the reason he's not fat anymore, he had his stomach stapled.  And if you ever hear what he eats and how he works out every day, it's insane.  He should be real thin at this point.  Yeah, but see.  His metabolism is different.  But he can do it.  Huh?  He's done it.  And the stomach stapling forces you to eat less.  If Steve wasn't such a greedy little bastard and selfish, you don't have to staple your stomach. 
[00:26:00]  Just eat as much as you would eat if you had a stapled stomach.  Steve, and no disrespect.  You look great.  You really do.  Steve is a tank.  But I talked to Steve.  What he goes through every day to try to keep that body in that form is ridiculous.  Current condition, yeah.  Well, Steve, the difference between Steve and a kid like that is Steve, even if it's natural to be a little husky, that's a good word, too.  Steve's a husky boy.  People are meant to be a little bigger, that's all. 
[00:26:30]  That's different between the kid who's obese and a husky.  If you're obese.  Steve has a stapled stomach.  Steve works out how many hours a day?  Hour and a half.  That means 45 minutes, by the way.  Hour and a half.  Hour and a half a day.  Lots of cardio.  Look at the old Steve's pictures.  Look at the old Steve.  Oh, my God.  All right, as you look at the old Steve picture, how much did he used to weigh, Steve?  400.  400.  Yeah.  Are you trying to tell me that let's go with Jimmy?  Jimmy could get up to 400 pounds?  Oh, my God.  It's impossible.  I could.  Did you see Jimmy's HBO special in 2004? 
[00:27:00]  I was 80 away.  You would have to eat, like, cake and pasta all day long every day to get up to that size.  There's no way.  There is nobody that has to be that fat.  Steve, he used to be really skinny.  No one walks around and has to be that fat.  I agree.  Steve, what were you doing back then?  Eating way too much.  Eating too much.  Probably McDonald's.  Yeah, a lot of fast food, a lot of carbohydrates, a lot of – it wasn't sweets.  It was, like, all carbs and pasta and breads and stuff like that. 
[00:27:30]  I mean, obviously, you're going to get two people that can eat the same thing, and one  guy's going to be fat and one guy's going to be skinny.  I see that.  Why isn't he thinner?  Yeah, it's his metabolism.  You're right.  But it doesn't mean you have to be fat.  You just have to work at it harder.  Everyone's got their cross to bear.  His is the fact that he eats a pretzel and gains 20 pounds.  And he's older.  His metabolism is different than an 8-year-old, where, like, it's harder to lose weight once  you get much older.  Very true.  Once you get 30, it's a lot harder to lose weight once you eat.  But, you know, I don't think there's any reason for the majority of the obese people, I'll 
[00:28:00]  even say the majority of obese people, to be that way.  I think a lot of them eat horribly.  They eat – they think cake and cookies for a snack is fine.  You can't do that.  There are things you've got to give up.  But you're born – do you agree you're born with some type of – like, a body type  in general?  Yeah.  And then you're – then it's really up to you what you do with that?  What you do with it, yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  But if you're going to decide that you're not going to do anything about it and be fat,  then you're going to be fat, and that's your cross to bear.  Me?  I have a family history where my frigging liver pumps out cholesterol like emeralds glue.  I've got to eat chicken.  I can't eat anything else.  That's it.  It's just chicken, chicken, chicken.  Chicken.  I know people, though – I know people, though, that have the same – that have  the same problem and will sit there and just continue.  You know, it doesn't matter what the doctor says. 
[00:29:00]  They'll eat red meat.  That's what I'm saying.  And cake and things.  And, you know, drop dead.  You're born with that, though.  And I think you're also born to be a fat guy.  But there are things you could do about it, I'm saying.  And some people choose to do things about it.  Other people choose not to.  Look at cultures like Africa.  And I'm not talking about where everybody's starving, but where it's just a different food,  different everything.  Like, I mean, I don't mean the starvation areas of Africa, but they're just much slimmer  because they eat differently.  Well, look at how conditioned people in this country are to the huge portions that are served 
[00:29:30]  out.  Even when you go out to eat, you get these piles of food.  Yeah, people love it.  They go, oh, you've been to this restaurant.  They've got huge portions.  They bring the big plate.  Look at this.  Wrap it up and take it home.  They love, like, yeah, a plate full.  And if you go to a fancy schmancy place that brings you that little thing, you're all annoyed.  It's like, why didn't I get a pile of food?  What is this?  It's like two scallops on a plate with a little bit of drizzled gravy on it.  You don't need to eat that much to sustain itself.  And that was one of the first things the surgeon that stapled my stomach said. 
[00:30:00]  He said, you'd be surprised at how little you actually need to consume to sustain life.  Then he pulled down his fly and showed you.  George in Queens, what's up?  Sorry we laughed so hard at that thing.  Yes, your new mantra, losing weight is fun.  What's up, George?  What's going on, boys?  In 2005, the National Institute of Health released a study pairing the eating habits of people all over the world.  In America, only one out of 15,000 people should be obese due to biological or glandular problems. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  Everybody else are just overeating jerks.  Yep.  In Europe, most of the food there is boiled or fried, yet they have less obese people in the entire continent of Europe than we do in the United States.  I think you're right, dude.  It's eating habits.  Yeah, it is.  We've got horrible eating habits.  A study out of a medical magazine.  People are constantly under or overweight people underestimate how much they eat in a day. 
[00:31:00]  A lot of them say they eat 1,000 calories a day when they're actually eating 2,000.  And then I just heard today driving in, people don't know how many calories they're even eating.  People coming out of Starbucks, they're talking to them about what they just got.  And one of their cups of coffee and scone, over 1,000 calories. 
[00:31:30]  Over 1,000 calories.  Well, because it's not a cup of coffee.  Yeah.  You don't get that from a cup of coffee.  Oh, exactly.  No, exactly.  They're getting all those.  You know, a specialty coffee.  But you're not thinking like I'm loading up.  Here, I'm walking out of the door of Starbucks with 1,000 calories, and that's just coffee and a snack.  But it's a coffee drink.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Frappuccino.  But that's what I'm talking about.  People are uninformed.  They don't care.  And they'll keep eating unhealthy.  I would love to eat that stuff. 
[00:32:00]  You know, I have a Starbucks.  I have regular coffee or a latte with soy milk because it's just caffeine.  I would love to have those scones and all that stuff.  I don't want to be a big fatso.  Tell yourself no once in a while.  You're right.  You know what I would friggin' kill for that I just can't eat?  Stupid Yankee Doodles.  Drake's Yankee Doodles are amongst the best thing ever invented on the face of this earth.  Cream-filled little chocolate cupcakes.  Yankee Doodles.  And there's three of them. 
[00:32:30]  There's three of them in a package.  And I shove each one in my mouth whole and just go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's wonderful.  What a fuddy-duddy.  Yankee Doodles.  Yankee Doodles are the best thing.  They're creamy yet chocolatey.  The ring-dings over Yankee Doodles.  Yes.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I'm not disparaging the ring-ding.  I love the ring-ding.  I love a yodel.  I will sit there and peel the chocolate off the yodel.  Yodel much better than a Yankee Doodle.  And then unroll the yodel.  And then peel it off and eat it all separately. 
[00:33:00]  I dissect a yodel.  Yankee Doodles are for queers.  I was just about to say that.  Well, then call me a queer.  I stopped and let you pass.  I was at a, that was a yield right there.  Holy crap.  I got stepped on.  I love Yankee Doodle.  They're so cakey.  I want a ring-ding now.  Yeah, let's go get some ring-dings.  Ring-dings are delicious.  Ring-dings for everybody.  Let's go.  I want one ring-ding.  Drake's cakes are marvelous.  You like the cakey ones, though.  I don't like the cakey ones. 
[00:33:30]  I like the nice, soft.  And if they're fresh, like the guy just brought them in on the hand truck, the yodel guy, and Yankee Doodle guy.  Where do you stand with the snowballs?  I hate the snowballs.  The coconut crap.  I was testing you.  That was a test.  It's like rubber.  That was a test.  You know what it is?  It's a test.  You know, there's only one way to eat those.  You got to peel off that rubbery coconut thing like Mission Impossible peels off the rubber mask.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  You peel it off and eat the chocolate cake.  Don't get ring-dings, Kenny.  I want one.  It's still horrible.  Have a ring-ding, and I'm going to throw the rest out like most fat people should do. 
[00:34:00]  Have a ring-ding.  Al Dukes likes devil dogs?  I was just going to say devil dogs.  Devil dogs aren't good.  I'd rather eat with that chicken the pictures was eating.  Devil dogs would be good if there was some goodness on the outside.  Al Dukes likes eating them, but you have to push the back of his head onto it.  They're not even devil dogs.  It's just Earl telling him that's what it is.  Al Dukes also likes a bare-bottom spanking.  He loves the color and the filling. 
[00:34:30]  Devil dogs.  You got some devil dogs on the small of your back, Al.  What's your favorite snack food?  Hey, we're asking right now.  1-866-3255.  That's a great break we could do.  That's right.  That'll get the ratings up in all these cities.  What's your favorite snack food?  What's your favorite snack food?  I do like a nice slice of pound cake, too, though. 
[00:35:00]  Buttery pound cake is good.  But better than pound cake?  Marble cake.  Because then you get the little chocolate marbling in there.  I am a cakey guy.  I am cakey.  I love cakey, not flaky.  I hear you.  Mmm.  W-N-T-E-R  First with the hit.  First with the news.  First on your dime.  Where the hit.  Lonelli's swelling up right now. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He stinks.  Now this is what radio should sound like, kids.  Top of the morning to you, love.  We're taking your phone calls with your favorite snack food.  We're the good guys in the morning.  The good guys.  What's your favorite snack food?  I need an echo.  Hello, love.  I'm shouting because I have nothing to say.  We're talking.  It's amazing.  Anthony seems to enjoy Yankee Doodles.  When Jimmy likes ringdings, it really goes to show how different we are as a people. 
[00:36:00]  Yankee Doodles are for queers.  Oh, guys.  Watch it.  Hey, cuz.  Oh, the hole is chiming in.  The hole is chiming in.  What's your favorite snack food, hole?  Where's my echo?  I know there's an echo on this board somewhere.  I like a devil dog at gunpoint.  A devil dog at gunpoint.  Come on, give me an echo, Tim. 
[00:36:30]  That's right.  8.30 in the morning.  Hello, hello, hello.  Oh, boy.  She just likes the devil dog because it looks like a...  There's the reverb on the gymnasium. 
[00:37:00]  We're talking about your favorite snack food.  Hello, love.  Hello there, ass.  Call us up.  Tell us, what's your favorite snack food?  Compelling radio.  Why doesn't Anthony have an echo?  I don't care.  There you go.  Hey.  Whoa.  Yeah, I got a little reverb and echo now.  Yeah.  What about the hole?  Does she have an echo?  Yes, she does.  I was with her last night.  I heard one all night long.  Echo has been with a lot of guys.  He likes a lot of big fat... 
[00:37:30]  That's right.  Hold on.  God, we suck.  All right, enough with the reverb.  I want to leave the reverb.  I think it adds to the program.  No, it sucks.  This is...  Yeah.  What?  Radio stations actually broadcast like this?  Oof.  Horrible.  Thank you, Thin.  People are calling...  Don't call in with your favorite snack.  We want to hear.  I want to hear.  Yeah, we want to hear.  We're going to end the show with taking phone calls about your favorite snack food.  So we'll turn the reverb back on. 
[00:38:00]  This is a bit the good guys would do.  And we know John Minnelli's more into that type of radio.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony on the Rock of New York, 92.3 K-Rock.  Coming up after ONA, at least 92 minutes of non-stop rock to start your work day.  92 minutes non-stop.  Every weekday at 9, K-Rock.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right. 
[00:38:30]  Heather the Feather, everyone.  Heather.  Hello?  Hi, Heather.  Heather.  Hi, you guys.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, we can hear you, Heather.  One second.  I'm getting off the bus, okay?  Oh, sure.  We're just doing a show.  No problem.  Why are you...  Hello?  Why are you taking a bus?  Why am I taking a bus?  Yeah.  Why not?  You're a filthy whore.  What?  What do you want?  You guys had me on hold for like an hour.  Yeah.  So, what do you want? 
[00:39:00]  What do I want?  Yeah.  I want to come on the show again.  And do what?  Fuck.  This is so dumb.  What?  Talk about what, Heather the Feather?  Talk about everything.  Like what?  Well, wait till I get off the bus.  I got like 30 seconds before I get off the bus.  Ah!  Heather, we're on in 18 cities.  We can't wait for you to walk off a bus.  Ah!  Why? 
[00:39:30]  Listen, I've been waiting an hour.  Can you wait for me, please?  You're a filthy whore!  Why?  Why?  When are you going to be off...  Shut up, Demi.  When are you going to be off the bus, Heather?  And like...  Could you shut up?  I'm waiting for the bus, the lights to turn green.  Could you shut up?  Why?  And don't be stupid.  Quiet.  Quiet.  You're a filthy whore!  I'm coming into the bus in like 30 seconds.  Shut up!  Shut up!  All right, I'll go to Paul for a second. 
[00:40:00]  Ah, Paul, what's up?  Ah, hey, while you're on that site, why don't you look up Rich Voss' career?  I was waiting for a Voss joke.  Can't we go one day without making fun of our pal, Rich Voss?  No, absolutely not.  We have the guy listening to every minute of our show.  Because he's so paranoid about what people are saying about him.  All right, let's go back to Heather the Feather.  Hello?  Heather.  Yes.  All right, so what's up?  Quiet.  Okay, I'm off the bus right now.  This is Heather the Feather. 
[00:40:30]  You guys remember me?  Quiet.  Quiet.  Quiet.  You were from Curbs in Staten Island.  Yes, Clay.  Shut up, Demi.  You were pretty good looking with a...  Beautiful brush.  Shut up, Demi.  With a mess downstairs.  Yes, the mess, yes.  That's because I'm like a virgin.  And you were very, very, very annoying.  I'm annoying?  You're the ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life.  Who is saying this?  What the hell is that?  What?  Wait a minute, you said I'm annoying?  Yeah.  Who's this? 
[00:41:00]  Hey, who's the stripper?  Shut up!  Hello?  You're the ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life.  The ugliest stripper?  Shut up.  Who's this?  I can't hear them.  Hello?  You're the ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life.  Okay.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Hello?  Okay, well, I'm coming over.  Oh, what a bitch!  Hello? 
[00:41:30]  You're a filthy whore!  Who is this?  I want to talk to Opie and Anthony.  You're talking to us.  We've been on the...  Oh, okay.  We've been on the line...  I can't hear you guys.  I'm in the store now.  We're pretty much making fun of you because we don't like you.  Okay, terrific.  Wait a minute.  You guys don't like me?  You're the ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, you potty mouth.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the eight, fellas.  Heather, do not curse, all right? 
[00:42:00]  All right.  But why do you think you mean me?  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Well, only if you teach me how, because I'm like a virgin, remember?  It's not about you, d***.  Who's the d***?  You stupid fucker.  Hello?  Hello?  We're talking to you.  Well, I don't know who's talking to me.  Opie or Anthony are both of you at the same time.  No, we've got like four guys in the studio.  We have a really good show.  Oh, you guys are ganging up with me. 
[00:42:30]  Meanwhile, there's one of me, and there's like four of you, right?  Who's all going?  Hey, Heather.  All right, so does that mean that you guys want to have a foursome?  Is that what that means?  Heather, here's my impression of you.  Here we go.  I got sort of a kind of brain.  I hope we're not wasting our time with this little picker.  Hello?  Hello?  What?  I keep going in and out, you guys.  Georgia! 
[00:43:00]  In and out of what consciousness?  So listen, when can I come back on the show?  How about never?  Never?  Don't you listen to the show, Whores are One Trick Ponies?  What a stupid voice.  What a stupid voice.  Uh-uh.  Hello?  You calling me a whore?  We're cakes for nothing!  You guys are f***ing tops.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to curse.  Hello?  I am coming on the show, okay?  And I'm going to give you both a beating. 
[00:43:30]  No slats.  Are you ready for your annual beating?  Translation, boring.  Yeah, all the listeners are saying you're very boring, Heather.  I'm boring?  Yeah, you're on the air in 18 cities and you're boring.  So why would we invite you back in here?  Oh, so the first time I was on the show, I was boring.  Is that what you're saying?  I was boring?  No, we just wanted to look at your boobs.  You weren't in here to talk.  I crumped my kid.  Oh, and that's it. 
[00:44:00]  You stupid bitch.  You're a stupid jerk.  I thought I told you to shut up.  You shut up.  Go F yourself!  Oh, yeah.  I am so boring.  That's why I got so many people coming to see me at Carves, right?  I'd say you're a lying scumbag.  What was that?  I'd say you're a lying scumbag.  See, you guys are not fair because you got all those sound clips going on  and you're talking and I'm by myself and you're janging up on me  and that's not fair.  Yeah, thanks, dick. 
[00:44:30]  What?  Yeah, thanks, dick.  Opie and Anthony.  We're right here.  We're talking to you.  I know, but you keep putting all those other voices on.  They're driving me nuts.  All right, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen and make me cry.  No, you don't want me to come back to the show?  Is that what you're saying?  You stupid hooker.  What are you going to do for us?  Whatever you want.  What's that mean?  Whatever you want, Anthony.  I hope you grow up and your womb is barren.  What?  Calm down, Paul. 
[00:45:00]  Paul Mercurio is in here from the deli show.  I hope you grow up and your womb is barren.  Okay, I've been a bad girl, so why don't you spank me, bad boy?  Sweet.  Multiple crap.  She would never will.  Heather, you have nothing.  I have nothing?  You have nothing for our show.  I have nothing.  Yes.  I have nothing for your show?  What do you mean I have nothing for your show?  I have everything, honey.  I'm probably the hottest story you ever had on the show. 
[00:45:30]  Right?  I say you're in the top hundred.  The top hundred?  The top hundred.  Oh, so you've had better breasts than me on the show, right?  Way better.  I don't think so.  Way better.  Why don't you bring all the girls together and let all the viewers decide on that?  Dylan!  Yeah, because radio shows have viewers.  Well, you know, and that website thing that you have going on, and that's whatever it is.  Kiss my ass!  Kiss my ass too, honey, because it's real sweet and small and silky and soft. 
[00:46:00]  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  All right, whatever.  You guys really don't want me back on the show?  Shut up, Demi.  Carlos Mencia is here.  He wants to say something to you.  Very funny guy.  Shut up, bitch.  That's funny.  Oh, and I'm laughing hysterically like mad.  Liar!  That's right.  He thinks what we're doing is very funny.  You're a liar!  I'm not even laughing.  That's how funny it is.  You know something that you're not telling us, you slimy scumbag liar! 
[00:46:30]  Oh, my God.  Where did you find this guy?  Psycho Mark.  What rock did he call out?  Hold on.  Psycho Mark wants to say something to you.  Who?  Psycho Mark.  Obviously, you don't listen to our show.  Yes, Psycho Mark.  You're a filthy whore!  All right, relax.  Okay, and you're probably a homer that loves to suck you-know-what.  Wow, good comeback.  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.  Shut up.  Wow, it sounds like a recording.  Can you give me something else?  And don't be stupid. 
[00:47:00]  Who's stupid?  I just...  All I want to say is everybody that's listening, come to Carves.  Hello.  And see Heather the Feather.  Hello.  That's it.  Hello.  That's it.  Hello.  I don't want to talk anymore.  I'm tired.  I gotta go.  Hold on.  It wants to say something to you.  Yes, Ann?  What do you want to say to Heather the Feather?  You're a friggin' moron.  You guys love me.  I want to admit it.  You know you love me.  Be more funny.  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass.  A lot of people say that sucked.  Got a mouth like an outboard motor. 
[00:47:30]  All the time.  When are you guys going to come to my club?  Go to sleep, crazy lady.  Listen, I want you to come to the club.  You are very ignorant.  You're ignorant.  You are even more stupid than I first thought you were.  You are smarter than me, right?  You're the ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life. 
[00:48:00]  Okay, in your dreams, baby, you wish you could find something as beautiful as me.  Shut up!  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  Are you freaking nuts?  Hello?  What?  I want to come on the show again.  And do what?  And show my beautiful breasts again.  Got milk?  Ugh.  Ugh?  Yeah, ugh.  I want you to know, you've never tried it.  Mama, I want ninny. 
[00:48:30]  Ugh.  God damn it.  All right, just tell me the day I come in the show when I'm going to get off the phone.  Ugh! Poof!  Ugh! Poof!  Because you're killing my cell phone, Bill.  Uh, are you going to shave that forest?  Uh, you want me to shave it live?  I smell vermin, poontain.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep, I will.  I don't know.  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  Hold on.  Uh, somebody wants to talk to you on the line here.  Uh, some guy named, uh... 
[00:49:00]  I can't read the name.  Uh, friend...  Uh, friend...  Uh, friend...  Uh, uh...  Oh!  Frenchie, it looks like.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Frenchie.  Hey, you want to say something to Heather?  What are you doing?  You're boring, everybody.  Why don't you go and kill yourself in the goddamn dump in Staten Island, you whore?  What are you, like a freaking retard?  Where are you from from another planet?  Where are you from, like, out of space?  Stupid bitch.  What are you, from, like, out of space?  Hey, where are you from?  From Mars, you stupid whore bag?  I've got like 400 pounds. 
[00:49:30]  Kill yourself, you stupid whore.  Oh, yeah.  You're better, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm much better than you.  That's for sure.  Oh, yeah.  What are you doing?  Like, huh?  Because right now, when you speak, everybody wants to kill themselves because of you, you stupid bitch.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Why don't you go back in Staten Island, you whore?  Oh, God.  Why don't you come over here, like, you stupid whore?  Put you on the rotisserie, one on the front, one on the back.  At least you shut your big mouth.  Oh, I'm sorry, guys.  You sound like a retard.  Did you ever go to Staten Island?  I'm sorry, guys.  I forgot.  Hey, do that line again. 
[00:50:00]  You sound like a retard.  That was too fun.  That was too fun.  Why don't you go back where you came from?  Shut up.  Shut your big mouth, you whore bag.  Why don't you go back where you came from, you ugly dud?  Hey, you Italian, right?  You sound like an Italian hot bitch.  That's what you are.  You ugly dud.  Yeah, huh?  You sound like an Italian girl, you know, like those sleazeballs.  Why don't you come to clubs and say that to my face?  You stupid bitch.  Why don't you come to clubs and say that to my face?  I won't even give you the time of day.  How's that?  Why?  I'm on the radio line.  I won't even give you the time of day. 
[00:50:30]  How's that?  Yeah, huh?  Anytime you want, honey.  All right, come to clubs.  Come to my club.  Anytime.  Come to my club.  You're such a big shot.  Why don't you come to my club?  Good job, Vera.  You know what it is?  You're probably so ugly, they wouldn't even let you in the club.  How's that?  Yeah, but I can recognize you for a mile away.  That's where she will be.  Yeah, you're probably so ugly.  And what are you, like a midget?  I heard you're a midget and you got no d***.  Yeah.  You wish, honey.  You wish.  All right, Vera.  All right, guys.  We don't want to burn you out.  All right, big boy. 
[00:51:00]  When was the last term you had a spanking?  Nice girl, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mime.  Is that Dutch still on the phone?  Uh.  Is that Dutch still on the phone?  Hello?  They hung up on me.  Hello?  Did they?  Well, there you go. 
[00:51:30]  Look, she's pissing me off.  You know what, though?  Frenchie is back in the listener's good graces, man.  Ben, what's up?  Yo, I just wanted to call and say I hate Frenchie, but goddamn, he just redeemed himself.  That was awesome.  Yeah, Frenchie.  Yeah, that was pretty funny.  Yeah.  Frenchie's doing the Frenchie dunking booth at the celebrity bikini softball game.  You whore.  I got to make that.  I love that. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  You whore.  I like how he's going to fill her mouth up until she drowns.  Like the whore that you are.  Where's the tape of Stinky yelling at Heather the Feather and her friends?  Oh, that one's classic.  We got to play that going into break.  We had Stinky, Heather the Feather and her girls were so annoying that we had Stinky attack them.  I like when you say, Psycho Mark wants to say something.  Who?  What, you don't listen to the show?  What, for three years?  That was funny. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, that was pretty good.  You're a filthy whore.  All right, Rick is just trying to find this tape, and we'll take that into break.  How annoying.  Now someone's saying Ted Knight had prostate cancer, Anthony.  What?  I should get that checked out, Spaulding.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Frenchie, the new pit bull of the O&A show.  It's always funny to put Frenchie on.  Well, you know, I was getting tired of him, and that was the best Frenchie use ever.  You know what?  He had a great line, but then he said the F word, so we had to dump out. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, and I just walked out on my job today, guys, and you guys just cheered me up, so keep it going.  And what happened to you in the job?  Oh, it's just too long a story.  But all I can say, first of all, he wouldn't let me listen to you guys.  Wow.  And then finally, I found syndication on the ground, so that worked out.  Nice.  All right.  But anyway, keep it going.  You guys are great.  All right.  Hang in there, Mike.  This is the O&A virus spreading across America.  Hey, guys, Opie and Anthony, we're away.  This is the best they could come up with.  See you after the holidays. 
[00:53:30]  I just read that.  Yeah, that was very red.  That's okay, though.  It should be like, you know, hey, we're away.  This is about, like, the best they could come up with.  But see, you missed the best there.  We'll see you after.  But it sounds natural.  Okay.  I actually acted that.  Try to sound natural for this next one.  Okay.  I love that we work on the show during the breaks.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, by the way.  And just before we turned on the mics, Anthony said that he took Club Soda Kenny's advice.  Yeah, I was taking Club Soda Kenny's advice from yesterday by trying to fool your muscles, 
[00:54:00]  you know, by lifting.  Because we were asking him kind of yesterday, you know, because Kenny is just a workout animal.  And everybody asks advice of Kenny on working out and stuff like that.  And he said, you know, I was asking him about weight.  Yeah.  And he goes, well, you've got to fool your muscles.  Sometimes throw a little less weight on, sometimes a little more.  They won't expect it.  It's like your muscles have little brains in them. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  It's like, hey, what the hell is that?  Now, the other day, this was about 15 pounds lighter.  So I was just doing that yesterday, and I fooled it on the upside.  And now I'm feeling it a little today.  A little tight, a little sore.  A little sore, but not bad.  If I could fool my muscles, I would just trick them into thinking they'd worked out.  Exactly.  Hey, they fooled me.  I know.  I'm working on my 10-inch pythons. 
[00:55:00]  You know, that's why I'm doing it.  My little twig arms.  I know.  I'm a skinny little guy.  What was I going to say?  I'm working on my yoga break.  I'm not there yet.  Uh-uh-uh.  I'm not there yet.  A little yoga?  I was ready to bring the skin doctor to the radio show, but I'm not ready to bring the  yoga thing to the show yet.  Doing a little yoga.  Perfectly healthy.  Oh, yoga.  Aleister Crowley was one of the biggest Satanists ever.  He was a yoga fanatic. 
[00:55:30]  It's not unmasculine.  Is that Mr. Crowley?  Yes.  He was also bisexual.  Mr. Crowley!  Really?  That guy?  Yes.  He was a what?  He was a tremendous yoga person.  He was a sex fanatic.  He was just a dirty, dirty boy.  Mussolini threw him out of Italy for being too degenerate.  Really?  Yeah.  That's a great story.  He was like a cat's blood or something.  He was just a real kook.  He was a goose, as we say.  Well, I got like two of those herniated discs from all those years of being active.  And I went to rehab, and I'm fine and all, but- 
[00:56:00]  Why?  You just started drinking because of it?  And they-  Oh.  Yeah.  There's other kind of rehab.  And then they suggested the old yoga.  Yoga.  To kind of get the back nice and strong.  But I'm not ready to bring it to the table yet.  I got to get some more observations, and then we'll do a yoga break.  Yeah.  Is that it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'll look into it a little more so you can do the break without making it sound like you're effeminate.  Oh, dude, man.  I'll be completely honest with you. 
[00:56:30]  It's quite faggy.  Yeah.  It is quite faggy.  But I hear it's-  Not a lot of masculine guys doing the yoga.  Let's just put it that way.  Because it puts you in these positions that make you look a little silly as a guy.  But what makes that all right is the fact that there's all women around you for the most part,  so you get to see some interesting things.  That's good.  But-  You get to see a lot of stuff. 
[00:57:00]  See some guys, too, huh?  Look at me trying to make yoga cool.  I get it.  I like yoga, man.  If I didn't have a bad right foot, I would have done a lot more of it.  It's great for me.  You and that goddamn foot.  What's wrong with it?  I need surgery.  No, you don't.  Okay.  Do you?  No.  I just wanted some sympathy.  People saying, why aren't you doing Pilates?  I did them yesterday.  Pilates just sounds not good.  That sounds like another girl thing.  Yeah.  Well-  Like, yeah, Pilates. 
[00:57:30]  I had to go to-  Why don't you go to a spinning class?  Yeah, there you go.  Spinning is another thing that, like, of course, it's a hell of a workout,  but it's not quite the most masculine workout thing you could do, I think.  You know what, though?  There's not one person in this room that could get through a spinning class.  I know.  And I consider myself in pretty good shape.  Dude, I couldn't do yoga.  But in my gym, I see those spinning classes going on.  I'm like, wow.  Insanity.  I got a ways to go still.  Yeah.  Pilates is-  But Pilates just sounds Pilate-ish. 
[00:58:00]  Pilates.  We did 10 minutes yesterday because we were running late,  and then we just did the thighs.  Oh.  You watch the DVD, and you do the thighs.  You and other men touching them together?  Yes.  Jimmy actually has exercise, like, DVDs and stuff.  Do you?  Yeah.  I need, like, real interaction.  Do you actually, like, you know, on your cable,  you can go to the exercise channel?  Jimmy goes to the exercise channel and does Pilates with his girlfriend.  It's good when you have a mat.  I forgot about this.  Yeah, but you have a mat at home.  It's good to do once in a while.  You invite a guy over named what? 
[00:58:30]  No, you invite a mat do over.  Oh, I thought it was something a little kinky.  And I hear you follow the easy girl or something, your girlfriend.  Oh, is there, like, three different-  Yeah.  Your girlfriend, like-  Okay, two ones.  There's the high-energy one, and then the low-impact one.  Oh, your girlfriend threw you under the bus.  I forgot about this.  We're in Vegas.  Oh, shit.  And she told me that Jimmy does the Pilates on TV with her.  And she's in really good shape.  Yes.  Really good shape.  And she said that Jimmy follows the easy girl.  Oh, the easy girl.  And they even announced ahead of time, if you're just getting started with Pilates, you might 
[00:59:00]  want to follow Susan.  And Susan's just not as in shape as the other girls.  No, what happens is this.  It's this French Pilates DVD.  And the girl is like, I'm going to do this.  And Betsy will have her legs half bent.  Her name is Betsy.  And she does everything halfway.  Halfway.  All halfway Betsy.  You want to choke Betsy.  It's just funny to watch.  We would always say things like, while I'm doing this, we would throw in, Betsy will  be napping. 
[00:59:30]  Betsy does nothing.  I don't know how she's in shape.  I think Betsy makes herself throw up before the shoot.  But Pilates, man, that's a workout.  It's all that the core breathing.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's rough.  You know what?  My chick does it and then critiques me.  Like, you know, your legs aren't.  I want to shut your mouth.  Someone suggests you do a baby size.  You get some baby size videos.  Dude, I'll tell you one thing about yoga, though.  I mean, I'm just getting started.  And it's tough to get through a class. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Without farting.  I've heard that about yoga, too.  Like, you're twisting yourself in all these positions.  And people are just blasting left and right.  Dude, that's all you hear in the room.  I hope they got a good ventilation system in there.  Oh, yeah.  Windows wide open.  You hear some.  And they want you to do the.  When you're breathing out.  I refuse to do that.  Oh, stop it.  But, man, you can't get through a class without.  With a little toot here and there. 
[01:00:30]  A little toot.  A little sound that says you're doing the moves right.  Yeah.  You're not doing it right.  Does the instructor do it?  What?  No, he's.  Blast one out?  The guy's an animal.  It's ridiculous.  Every so often.  No, you're not doing it right unless you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, but you hear it coming from all over the room.  Oh, that's disgusting.  It really is.  But it's really funny, too, man.  I want a yoga body.  Do you?  We've always said it. 
[01:01:00]  Fart equals funny, no matter what.  Yeah.  I mean, it's disgusting and all that.  Does the class snicker?  Do they snicker?  You kind of look around and see some smiles.  You know, people are trying to, like, stay cool.  But it's really funny, man.  Oh, by the way, just to back up, because I am developing my yoga break here.  I forgot to tell you.  A lot of people would assume that this guy, the yoga instructor, is gay.  It's coming in like crazy, and there's a feedback.  He talks about his wife, that she does her own class and stuff. 
[01:01:30]  Whatever.  I'm just setting up what I'm about to say.  Now, you're in a yoga class, and it's pretty much all women, me, and two or three other almost guys.  And I'm like, what am I doing here?  And all of a sudden, like, you know, because it's a beginning of class.  We're, you know, doing positions and stuff, and you see how I'm slouching?  Yeah.  Like, if you're really good at yoga, you wouldn't be slouching?  No, you'd sit up straight in your chair.  And like Jimmy said, he wants a yoga body.  Well, this guy has the yoga body. 
[01:02:00]  You know.  What is a yoga body?  He doesn't have an ounce of fat on him, right?  And then in the middle of the class, like, it's already awkward that you look like a total dick doing these positions and stuff.  And the farts are coming.  You're a beginner, right?  All of a sudden, he decides he needs to show the class his spine and his back and his abs to show you that you're in the right position.  So in the middle of class, he just takes off his shirt.  Oh, God, what a show off.  And all the women, you could just hear them all just like, just like, they're trying to control themselves. 
[01:02:30]  I'm like, oh, great.  Did you hear a couple of, oh.  Yeah, like, mm.  I mean, from the other, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Oh.  But half the women in the place can't control themselves.  I'm like, oh, just great.  Well, you put your shirt on.  Put your shirt on.  What a stunt that is.  Come on.  And then he's like stretching his back and pushing out his chest and bending all the way over.  Just showing what he's got to offer to the women, basically. 
[01:03:00]  It was like a mating call.  It's a freaking mating call in the middle of the class.  He knows, because he's got all the plumage.  Right.  And you guys look like plucked chickens walking around.  He knows the score.  He's got the plumage, and we all look like veals just getting started here.  Right.  They finally let us out of our little, like, dark box.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I was impressed, though.  I'm like, nice move, dude.  Bravo.  Bravo to you. 
[01:03:30]  Obviously, you're looking for some strange you-know-what.  You go for it, buddy.  He's probably working it.  I'm like, all right, you've got to give him credit.  A straight guy in a yoga class, man.  Even if they're all straight guys that are there, it doesn't matter.  They're so, most of them are women.  I've never taken a class.  I always had people come to my house, because I knew with my stupid foot I couldn't do a lot of the stuff.  Never do that.  What?  Never do DVDs or people come to that, because I've got to leave the house.  I've got to leave the house.  Because putting a DVD of a workout, I'd rather put in, like, Caddyshack. 
[01:04:00]  I'll just sit on my ass and watch television unless I have to physically get up and go to a place that is exclusively made for exercising without any other entertainment value whatsoever.  Or I'll just be distracted.  I'm like a child.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  WXRK New York.  92.3 KROQ.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:04:30]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, well, the next segment might get a little uncomfortable.  Dude.  What?  Shut that door.  So it's been...  Three hours.  Three hours.  Waiting to come on our show.  The whistle's been out there.  Dude, dude.  He, I was going to take a leak.  He comes out of the bathroom, and he's wiping his hands off.  So apparently he washed his hands, and so he goes to shake my hand. 
[01:05:00]  I'm like, well, I like a man that washes his hands.  I go, and I point it to the no S zone sign that is now on our bathroom door.  We had to put the sign up after yesterday.  It says no S, you know, on the door.  And I said, you didn't, you know, and I point it to the sign.  He goes, no, no, no.  Whistler, and all this dead serious.  He goes, Whistler has to drink a lot of water.  And I've been drinking a lot of water.  Yeah, a Whistler.  He calls himself Whistler.  He goes, a Whistler.  He goes, has to drink a lot of water. 
[01:05:30]  And I've been drinking since, you know, for a couple of hours now.  I'm like, oh, cool.  You know what else a Whistler has to do?  Give up all claims to box.  So then I go to the bathroom.  I come out, and he goes, my card.  And he gives me his card.  Right.  Steve the Whistler, international champion.  So I look, and of course I have to go, well, international champion. 
[01:06:00]  And he goes, well, since that card's been printed, I'm now international grand champion.  Dude, deadly, deadly serious.  Deadly serious.  So basically, we're going to be talking to the best Whistler in the world.  Dude, he's got a CD out called Broadway and Beyond.  Steve the Whistler, Herpes.  Hold on.  Opie, use all your talents and power to describe that album cover.  So I can't. 
[01:06:30]  You have to.  Give me that thing.  Give me that thing.  Okay.  It's right outside.  Be quiet.  The disc.  What?  I love when he gets uncomfortable here.  It better be turned down.  This is getting a little out of control.  It's turned down, right?  Dude.  Broadway and Beyond.  Steve the Whistler, Herpes.  International champion.  And then there's a picture of him.  Okay.  His lips pursed in the whistling fashion. 
[01:07:00]  He almost has, I guess the closest thing you could say is a slight Joey Buttafuoco look.  Would you say that?  Was this some of him?  Yeah.  Okay.  He is.  Uh-oh.  CD that's skipping.  On the cover.  Oh, no.  He is standing on what looks to be a, the backdrop is Broadway.  And he has his hands out like an opera star, tenor or something, would have if he was singing. 
[01:07:30]  He's in a suit with a red bow tie.  And he's whistling on the cover.  You see his lips are like this.  He's whistling.  On the back, though, it's the cash, Steve the Whistler.  He's sporting a sweater and some pants and cowboy boots.  As he is reclining on the back of his Aurora.  What is that?  A Buick?  Yeah.  His Buick Aurora showing his New York license plate that says, Whistler.  Whistler.  He's like, it looks right out of some, like, turn off on Long Island somewhere, New York. 
[01:08:00]  Wow.  As he said, did you see the back of this yet, Jimmy?  Jimmy, look.  All right, let's listen.  Let's listen to Steve the Whistler.  All right.  What song is this, Opie?  What track?  Oh, you'll know.  Oh, I will?  Yeah.  Memories from Cats. 
[01:08:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Sounds like Zamfir, Master of the Pan Flute.  Wow.  Wow.  Every dog in Manhattan has his head slightly tilted 45 degrees, looking about, confused. 
[01:09:00]  I was going to whistle along.  Incidentally, this picture where he's reclining, you would actually look more masculine if  you were reclining on a mule.  He's out ready to come in.  Oh, is he?  Okay.  All right.  Now, people.  People on the phones, we might need your help.  Serious questions all night.  Yeah, let's, no fooling around today.  We want a serious interview, so we're looking for serious questions only.  But Steve, the whistler. 
[01:09:30]  And to the phone screener, please, when you type the serious questions only, use code words  so he does not look over at the screen.  All right.  Let's start.  All right.  Let's welcome Steve, the whistler, onto the Opie and Anthony show.  And I'm whistling a little to welcome him.  Don't whistle in front of him.  I don't.  I don't want to, like, clap my hands and go, because it might be wrong.  I might be doing it wrong.  No.  Now, I found out Jimmy Norton, Opie, doesn't know how to whistle.  No, maybe Steve can teach a little Jimmy Norton how to whistle. 
[01:10:00]  You got a whistler hat, do you?  I saw that with a little musical note on it.  I was just, I go, whistling.  You know, that's one of the ways I whistle.  I was purring my lips trying to whistle, and I just can't do it.  Hey, Steve, thanks for your card.  Thank you.  Steve giving Opie one of his cards.  And Opie, if I might tell you.  SteveTheWhistler.com.  Oh, SteveTheWhistler.com.  If I might tell you, Opie, where it says SteveTheWhistlerherps,  and then it says International Champion, I was informed.  Well, let Steve tell.  Steve, you are not just the International Champion. 
[01:10:30]  No, I'm actually the International Grand Champion.  Grand Champion.  Now, what does that entail?  Well, we have an international competition, the third week in April,  down in Lewisburg, North Carolina.  North Carolina.  And people come from how far reaching?  Well, this year, the guy who got the award for coming the furthest was from India.  India.  And was he a good whistler?  The highest arc.  He was very good.  He was very good.  But he's no, you know, Steve, the whistler. 
[01:11:00]  Well, he didn't make it to the finals.  Didn't.  Now, what are people looking for when they're judging whistling?  Well, you have a panel of judges, most of whom are musical educators.  And this year, we had a couple of former champion whistlers.  And they're looking for a degree of difficulty of the piece you're doing.  So, if you're just doing something that's kind of easy, not a lot of note changes,  they might not look at that as seriously as somebody who's doing a lot of note changes and dynamics. 
[01:11:30]  Right.  Things like that.  That wouldn't be considered competitive.  Right.  Do a lot of people enter these contests, Steve?  How many people?  Well, we have kids, teens, and adults competing.  And this year, we had 31 adults.  And of that, we had seven women and 24 men.  Now, you were first place in classical music?  Yes.  What kind of songs would you do classically?  Well, this year, in the preliminary round, I did Claire de Lune by Claude Debussy.  Claire de Lune. 
[01:12:00]  Claire de Lune.  Yes, Claire de Lune.  And in the final round, I did Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 by Franz Liszt.  I don't think I've heard that one.  I probably would know it as something else, right?  You would definitely know it as something else.  As a matter of fact, it's probably been used in a lot of animated cartoons.  Oh, well, then I probably did hear it.  Can you give us a little piece of that?  So, maybe we could know what that sounds like.  Well, I don't know if he's warmed up, Anthony.  I kind of want to hear.  No, he's warmed up.  Oh, you're warmed up there, Steve?  Yeah?  I was whistling out there in the lobby, yeah. 
[01:12:30]  Now, is this the music for it?  This is the accompanying music.  The accompanying music.  I have a question, though.  Yes, Jimmy?  Would all the whistlers laugh if a stroke victim entered?  I'm sorry, what was that?  Oh, well, let's play...  You're a horrible man.  Let's play Steve's music.  Let's hear.  Let's hear the music.  And we'll let Steve go here.  And see if we recognize him.  You didn't know you were going to have so much intro, huh? 
[01:13:00]  Well, I'm enjoying it.  It's pretty.  And I do recognize it.  It's quite a trailer.  Uh-oh.  There we go. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, B.  Okay. 
[01:14:00]  Okay.  Nice dynamic.  It sounds like an instrument.  That's very good. 
[01:14:30]  How long is this song?  Too long for this.  Yeah.  But that's a very good demonstration of that song.  There's a lot of dynamic to that.  Very talented.  Now, how the hell do you figure out you can do this so well?  A lot of practice behind this?  Yes.  Years and years of practice. 
[01:15:00]  It's like, how do you get to Carnegie Hall?  Practice.  Practice, they say.  Now, how old were you when you first took this interest in whistling?  About seven or eight.  Seven or eight.  Did your dad maybe whistle around the house?  As a matter of fact, he did whistle, especially in the car whenever we went places, and that's  how I got started.  And you'd join in and whistle along with dad.  They didn't have Little League in your town?  Yeah, actually, they did.  Steve, do you get a little ribbing about the whistling?  Oh, sure. 
[01:15:30]  You do?  Sure.  Sure.  Do you perform live?  I do perform live.  What kind of venues would we be able to catch you at?  I have had occasion to whistle at Avery Fisher Hall.  Stop.  At Carnegie Hall.  At Carnegie Hall.  You took the stage at Carnegie Hall and whistled.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  And I whistled up at West Point with the cadets.  Yeah.  And, you know, different...  Actually, one of the funniest things, I was hired by Lohman's...  Yes, please.  Lohman's Department.  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  Lohman's Department story. 
[01:16:00]  They hired me to whistle at the retirement dinner of their chairman.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Did they pick a wacky song?  No, actually, we had to pick his favorite songs.  What was some of his favorites?  Oh, New York, New York, Greensleeves, Impossible Dream.  Do you do any songs that you wouldn't ordinarily think a whistler should be doing?  Any newer songs or something that kids might like, listen to?  Well, actually, one of the ones that you probably wouldn't expect is Sir Duke by Stevie Wonder.  Stevie Wonder, Sir Duke. 
[01:16:30]  Maybe we could get a little of that.  And Steve, the whistler, Herbst, will now whistle along...  Can't wait.  ...to Sir Duke.  Stevie Wonder.  You remember this.  Stop it, Opie.  You're going to think it's him.  Stop it.  I'm going to hear it.  Stop it. 
[01:17:00]  Just sing along.  Yeah, everyone?  Yeah.  Oh, he went off.  Oh, babe.  You're ruining it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right, Jimmy. 
[01:17:30]  Wow.  Stop.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, yeah.  Stop it, Opie.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Thank you very much. 
[01:18:00]  Stop.  Would you stop?  I didn't do a whistler.  Beautiful.  That's a tell.  You're, uh...  SteveTheWhistler.com.  Your lips must cramp up like a $5 hooker, though, sometimes, huh?  You ever have that happen to you?  If I whistle long enough, they do get tired.  They do get tired.  How long would a performance be that they wouldn't just freeze up on you?  It ever happen to you?  And you go, uh-oh.  Not in a performance, no.  I can't go on, no?  Have you ever...  Do you ever do this just to be silly, though?  Like, you ever been giving a...  To a girl and then just stop and whistle so it sounds like she's falling off a building? 
[01:18:30]  Well, this isn't going so well.  Oh, P.  Okay.  I didn't do anything that time.  Steve, does it annoy you if, like, when Opie started whistling over you?  That's got to be tough.  Only if people thought it was me.  Yeah, see?  That's what I was thinking.  Like, people are going to think that...  I thought I did pretty well.  You did horribly.  You did horribly.  What do you think of Opie's whistling?  It wasn't even on key.  Well, he just did a day job. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Very good.  Well, the phones are alight with people that want to learn more about whistling.  Why can't I whistle?  It's so annoying.  I cannot whistle.  Hey, maybe you could teach Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton can't whistle.  Give it a try.  I swear to God, I have the work with my weak chin and little percy lips.  I can't whistle, and I never...  It's like you're waiting for a mama bird to regurgitate something into your mouth.  What is he doing wrong?  He's blowing too hard.  Oh.  Well, I've been kicked out of many a car for that. 
[01:19:30]  I want to ask Al Dukes if it's true that he had the flu during the fight on Friday.  Oh, Al Dukes.  Well, how do I do it?  Use your ears.  Wait.  How do I do it?  It sounds just like him, man.  Hey, Ryan, what's up?  Yes.  Ryan.  Hello, guys.  What's up?  We're talking to Steve the Whistler.  I can hear it.  I've been whistling for the last 20 minutes in the car.  He's fabulous.  Is he great?  I need to know his opinion on something, because there's nothing worse than when you have a 
[01:20:00]  profession associated with something bad, and I'd like to know what he thinks about  the following saying.  Whistle while you work.  Hitler was a jerk.  Look, Mussolini was a meanie, but the Japs were worse.  Steve, what do you think?  What do I think about that statement?  What the hell was that?  I don't know, but Whistle while you work is a nice song.  It probably is, right?  Especially if you're murdering Chandra Levy.  You know something?  I want to apologize, Steve, for that man, because he doesn't have any class or couth, and he can't 
[01:20:30]  appreciate some of the arts.  I'm not knocking and whistling.  I just think it'd be funny to whistle it to him while you're digging a grave and dumping  a body into it.  Steve, he's a traveling comedian, and he's in New York City this weekend, and we don't  have an association with him at all.  We'd rather...  So don't mind him.  He's from L.A.?  Don't mind him.  You're from L.A.?  Not originally, no.  Akron.  Akron.  Okay.  Let's go to Aaron.  Home of the Beacon Journal.  Yes!  Aaron!  Hey, guys.  Hey, Aaron.  How are you guys doing today?  I'm on the phone with Steve, the Whistler Herbst. 
[01:21:00]  Hey, good afternoon, Steve.  Hi, how are you?  Pretty good.  So you've been whistling for quite a while, huh?  Oh, yeah.  For like 48 years.  Wow.  Have you, like, acquired the ability to whistle with large objects in your mouth?  You ever try any trick whistling like that, I guess, is what you're trying to get at?  That's a good question.  Yes.  No, but actually, I can whistle several different ways, including in as well as out.  Stop.  Oh, let's hear a little of that.  Let's hear a little in whistling.  Well, see if you can hear the difference.  Okay.  All right.  Everyone listen.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
[01:21:30]  Yes.  I hear a difference.  It's a little more woodwind sounding on the in.  Wait, when did he change?  I heard him change.  It was just a slight difference.  Where did you change, Steve?  He might have been watching.  That would be a giveaway.  Was it?  Oh, I wasn't supposed to tell?  You might have been cheating.  I didn't want to watch.  You can close your eyes and hang it up with my ears. 
[01:22:00]  Okay, try it again, and I'll tell you exactly when you change.  Okay.  Do a different song?  I'm not looking.  I'm going to try it.  Do a different one.  Do a different one.  Now!  No, you jack-off.  No.  Try it again.  No, you dumb bunny.  Try it again.  Okay, go ahead.  I'm not watching.  He's whistling in already. 
[01:22:30]  That's out.  Did you whistle in there?  You know something?  God bless you.  I didn't even notice that time.  I think it was that I was watching the first time.  Well, the idea is to be able to keep going without having to stop for the breath.  Why can't I do it at all?  He can't do it at all.  Because you have a light.  Oh, God.  Look at your nothing lips trying so hard. 
[01:23:00]  It might be genetic.  I don't know.  It could be genetic.  Yeah.  See, you blow it too hard.  See, stop.  Don't blow so hard.  When I do it, nothing comes out.  My little empty...  I have a Down Syndrome tongue.  Just lols.  Look at his face.  Levi, what's up?  Levi, Levy, Levy.  There's a theory out that you need to be able to curl your tongue to...  See, that's what I was saying before.  And then we just, you know, did something with each other's seas and we forgot about it. 
[01:23:30]  Steve, a lot of people want to know what you lubricate your lips with.  Oh, is there any special lip care that you need?  Soft and supple.  So, basically, you know, a lip balm helps and water.  Oh, water.  Lip balm and water.  Who knew?  Levi.  The recipe of champions.  Hey, what's going on?  Yes, yes.  Levi.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Hey, I was wondering if this guy knows anything to do with upbeat classics, like maybe some  Flight of the Bumblebee.  Wow, that would be rough.  You ever try Flight of the Bumblebee? 
[01:24:00]  I haven't, and that's not one of the ones in my repertoire.  Yeah, that would be a tough one.  However, the Hungarian Rhapsody, later on in the piece, is very up-tempo.  I'll have to listen to that.  Yeah, let's go to Well Hong.  Well Hong.  Hey, Steve.  It sounds like it bends more when you're whistling in.  A what?  It sounds like it bends more when it's whistling in.  Like it bends more?  Yeah, the notes.  Oh, actually, I got a request for Steve.  It's not as quite a pure sound.  Ah.  Oh.  Steve, can you whistle I Feel Pretty and dedicated to little Jimmy Norton? 
[01:24:30]  Well, yes, and actually that's on the CD, on my CD, Broadway Beyond.  Oh, is it?  Oh, you got a CD.  Broadway and Beyond, I Feel Pretty from West Side Story, of course.  There's a medley from West Side Story, and I Feel Pretty is one of the tunes.  All right, Steve, are you going to be performing any time soon?  Any performances coming up, Steve?  Actually, no.  A week or so ago, I sang with the University Glee Club of New York City.  The Glee Club.  Which I've been a member for 24 years in Alice Tully Hall a week ago. 
[01:25:00]  And next fall, I expect we'll be doing a recital with my wife.  Because she and I...  Oh, what does she do?  Well, she used to be a professional singer, and right now she's...  She uses her armpit as a company man.  She's a lawyer.  She's a litigator.  Does she do any backup whistling for you?  She doesn't whistle.  Are you a single act?  Do you ever have the harmonies going on with you?  Somebody harmonizing whistling or anything?  Yeah, that happens. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, yeah?  That has happened.  I just want to know what kind of...  You know, what I can expect if I ever go to a performance.  Steve, thank you so much for coming down here and enlightening us a bit on whistling.  Well, could he leave us with a little more...  Do you want to leave with a little number, a little ditty?  Sure, you want to hear...  Which one?  Which one?  How about Maria from West Side Story?  Maria from West Side Story.  Well, I guess we could do that.  You remember that?  All right, hold on.  Very popular Broadway tune.  All right, here we go.  It's Steve the Whistler's.  First, first, you still got the Aurora? 
[01:26:00]  I do.  You do have the Aurora?  I do.  That is some sexy pose you got going there, Stephen.  Yeah, I thought it was fun.  Eh, it's all about fun, Anthony.  And was that picture taken out on Long Island?  No, that picture was taken in Putnam.  Really?  I thought it was D.C.  Because if you look under the tire, I think I see Chandra's skull.  Look, he's dragging me in to his debauch.  You made him happy.  Look, he laughs at me, see?  I did enjoy that.  There we go. 
[01:26:30]  I'll be rubbing a tug and we all laugh.  Okay.  Just went there to further herself and live her dream.  Ha, ha, ha.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened to the CD?  It didn't skip.  Rick.  Oh, my God.  Who happened?  Put it in the...  Oh, Steve, I'm sorry.  You put it in the wrong one, dude.  No, no.  Something happened to CD4.  All right.  Steve the Whistler.  It wasn't working last time.  I'm sorry.  SteveTheWhistler.com.  Maria. 
[01:27:00]  Which one is this?  Maria from West Side Story.  All right.  Here we go again.  Steve the Whistler.  What?  Oh, what the hell is going on with the CD?  Dude, you got it.  That's the third time you've had a problem with it.  Clean it.  This is the same one that was skipping earlier.  Put it in the other one.  But take the CD and rub it on your helmet.  I'll try the CD, too.  Steve the Whistler.  I'll look. 
[01:27:30]  I'll look.  Here we go.  From West Side Story.  Steve, I'm embarrassed.  What the hell is wrong with this?  Turn it off and turn it on.  And can you turn it off from the back there?  I'm doing it.  I'm holding the button down. 
[01:28:00]  I'm holding the button.  Track four, right?  Steve, I'm sorry.  Track nine.  It'll work now, though, I guarantee, because I saw the light on here and I pressed the breaker.  Yeah, nine.  Nine.  I'm sorry, Steve.  It's okay.  Here we go.  Steve the Whistler.  I'm holding it down.  It popped.  Dude, it popped. 
[01:28:30]  Maybe it's a CD.  It popped.  Steve, you got another.  It's not a CD, dude, because it was fine before.  You played other stuff on the CD.  It was fine.  Steve, you got another copy of the CD?  Damn it.  Did you burn this one yourself, Steve?  Yeah, Steve's getting another copy.  Oh, Steve, I see the problem.  Look.  Look at the back of this thing.  It's all smudged and stuff.  You got some cleaner?  I'm back.  Steve, you got some cleaner?  I don't have any.  You got any clear stuff to rub on that?  No, here.  Give it to me.  No, give it to me.  I'll try to clean it with my shirt.  This happens.  Make sure you're putting it in the one that I was pressing the button on in the back. 
[01:29:00]  All right.  Let's try this.  Oh, God.  That's A, not B.  This is embarrassing, and this is not the way to run a goddamn radio station.  I'm sorry, Steve.  Steve the Whistler.  Where did...  Yeah, I'm embarrassed now. 
[01:29:30]  Do you want to try one more time?  We don't have to.  Acting lessons, whistling lessons.  I can't believe this.  Do you have another copy?  I see you're looking.  Do you have another...  Well, not of that particular one.  Damn it.  But, you know, we can try a different CD with a different kind of thing.  All right, let me try this.  I want to hear this song.  It sounds beautiful, and there seems to be a problem with the CD player.  Steve?  You have all dollars and cents.  What's wrong, Steve?  No, I was saying you were playing the Broadway and Beyond CD before, weren't you? 
[01:30:00]  I thought I heard that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yep, yep, yep.  But it was skipping.  It was skipping.  Skipping.  Skipping.  The first track was skipping a little.  Is it our equipment?  Because then I would really be...  Flabbergasted.  I'm mortified.  Let's try it.  Mortified.  Let's try it again here.  All right.  One more time.  No, it's not going.  Stuck.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:30:30]  Nice tone, though, right?  Yeah, that was.  I apologize.  All right.  Oh, God.  Well, Steve, I think we're going to have to just take your word for it.  Well, either that or do something acapella.  What do you have...  Do you have another CD of music?  Yeah.  Maybe you could do another tune?  Sure.  Get that one.  Can I have the CD?  Right, no.  Look, I'm going to...  I'll check the button in the back.  I don't know how to solve that problem. 
[01:31:00]  Where'd everyone go?  What's wrong with you, Ben?  Steve, I work with a bunch of lunatics.  I'm sorry.  I don't know where Anthony went.  I don't know where Ben went.  Jim, why won't you look at Steve?  I have no problem looking at Steve. 
[01:31:30]  It's you I don't want to look at.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay, well, if this works, we'll be doing music of the night from Phantom of the Opera.  Oh, we're doing...  Oh, ready?  Track nine there, Steve?  Say goodbye to your key sound, everyone.  Oh, Steve the Whistler.  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  All right.  Sounds like it's working.  He's got a website, stevethewhistler.com.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  International Grand Champion.  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  Here it comes.  Second.  Second.  And...  Whoops.  We got farther that time.  Yeah, but this CD player is just ridiculous.  Yes, Jim?  I would...  Would it be possible, could you whistle singing in the rain while I'm raping a girl? 
[01:32:30]  Well, you know, you're trying to be outrageous.  You do this every time you're here, and it's not...  I don't know why we have you back.  It's not washing.  Steve...  This reminds me of the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Yeah.  Right.  And he's all three except for the good.  What?  Guess who the good guy is here.  I don't know.  Should be the good, the bad, the positive.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I can almost hear, see Clint ride up. 
[01:33:00]  No, Steve, you turned your mic off.  I did.  Yeah.  It hit on.  Son of a...  You mean that didn't get on, the good, bad, and the ugly?  Part of it did.  Oh, my God.  Part of it did.  Try it again from the top.  Did you hit the...  Yeah, he hit the mic on the second.  It's going off by itself, this mic. 
[01:33:30]  The mic's going off by itself?  You know what happened?  Someone spilled water there.  It popped off...  On, Steve!  Yesterday, someone spilled water there.  Who took the CD player?  No, Steve, hold the on button down, and it should work fine.  That's what we...  There's like a loose connection over there sometimes.  We rarely use that microphone.  They should put you on mic four.  Try it again.  Did we find another CD with the other song?  Not one.  It doesn't work?  Not one that's not...  Great.  Professional.  Welcome to New York City Radio and National Syndication. 
[01:34:00]  You need a boombox in here.  Yeah.  See?  That would work.  Oh, you know why, Ann?  It's a CD-R.  The CD-Rs don't...  The Dan and CD-Rs don't read in these machines sometimes.  We have one in here that does read them.  Well, these are old Dan's, and that's why.  Do we have a boombox, though?  Could it all come in with one on his shoulder?  All right.  You know, I think we've got to get Steve the Whistler out of here.  All right.  Steve, again, I'm a fan.  And your music is beautiful.  I appreciate you coming down.  I'm sorry about the technical glitches, and especially Jim Norton. 
[01:34:30]  Well, it's been fun to be here, and...  He's really an awful man.  Hopefully, you know, if I come back again someday, we'll...  Absolutely.  ...we'll work out the technical difficulties.  Let's do that then, Steve.  Steve, thank you.  Give out the website once again.  That's www.stevethewistler.com.  All right.  It went off the air.  The button went off.  What?  www.stevethewistler.com.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right.  Steve, uh... 
[01:35:00]  It was Steve...  I got the Steve part.  All right.  Steve.  That's www.stevethewistler.com.  Okay.  And the CD is Broadway and...  Broadway and Beyond.  And Broadway and...  You can act like a man!  Broadway and Beyond.  What do I want to do?  Gotcha.  And, uh...  And that's that, I guess.  Steve the Whistler.  Steve, thank you so much again.  And, uh, we'll talk to you soon.  Thanks.  Okay.  I'm sorry I said those things.  You should be.  Walk out Steve the Whistler as we go to news with, uh... 
[01:35:30]  With, um...  Well, I hope that works again.  Steve, thank you so much.  At, uh, 628, it's, uh, time for news and...  Yes, yes.  ...and traffic with, uh, Debbie.  Debbie!  What's going on on the roadways today?  Ah, yes.  I...  It's always such a...  A cluttered mess out there, isn't it, Debbie?  Debbie?  Yeah.  Oh, Steve?  Debbie?  Debbie?  Debbie?  Debbie?  He guessed me.  Debbie?  Where's, uh, Debbie?  He's...  Now he's...  Because Jimmy said that.  Jimmy goes, um... 
[01:36:00]  Holy Jesus.  I'm sorry I said that stuff.  Is it done?  Shut up, you dick.  Go talk to Steve so we can talk a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Make sure everything's...  Oh, my...  Oh, my God.  Dude.  When you were handed...  He's...  Ope's beckoning to me over the...  I know.  ...the CD.  That's when I fled my seat.  I left my seat.  I was embarrassed to be on this program.  I knew he was going to break it.  Ove goes, uh, Jimmy, could you hand that over?  And I'm looking at Ove going, no, he is absolutely not going to do this. 
[01:36:30]  But then I knew you did, and I got up and went behind your equipment.  Yeah, and that's what made me laugh harder, is that you just took the coward's way out and  hid behind the machinery.  I can't sit here when that's going on.  He's so uncomfortable.  When he kept turning off the goddamn CD player...  Ben hid in a spot, like, way under the console.  Oh, God.  When you kept turning off his music, like, right at the beginning when he started whistling,  I couldn't hold a straight face.  That's why I had to leave.  I had to leave. 
[01:37:00]  I went behind the equipment and cried.  My tears were back there.  God, that's so embarrassing.  I can't...  I can't...  I can't deal with situations like that.  I freaked out.  The best was the head in the background with the machines.  Yeah, I'm holding the button in.  I had to leave the situation.  Co-host chortling behind the machine to leave.  All right.  All right.  I think...  I don't know what...  We're away for a while.  Here's a funny segment.  See you after New Year's.  Peace. 
[01:37:30]  So, we should get into this with the Derek Jeter.  What was it called?  The Turn 2 Foundation 10th Anniversary Dinner.  Yeah, it was 10th anniversary.  He started it in his rookie year, back in 96.  And a lot of people were there.  A lot of Yankees.  Some other people.  Celebrities and whatnot.  Joe Buck hosted.  Joe Buck hosted.  He was pretty funny, actually.  Does a good job as a host.  He was pretty funny.  He was pretty funny.  Yeah, very natural.  And I guess XM bought a table, and Eric Logan decided to bring us. 
[01:38:00]  Yep.  The whole clue.  Everybody.  And some dudes for marketing.  Yep.  Hojo.  Hojo.  Yep.  Had a good time.  I went just to be part of the event.  That's all.  Just to hang out, see what it's all about.  We don't go to many of these things, that's for sure.  We're not the, you know, go to these star-studded extravaganzas where they bring out the little  plates with the appetizer thing all stacked up 10 feet high. 
[01:38:30]  And then the dinner comes out, and, you know, it's a hoity-toity event is what I like to  call it.  Hoity-toity.  Yeah.  I was in my suit and tie, and then we have Jimmy Norton.  Well, you came late.  Yeah, I got there a little late.  Elo met me at the bar area, and Jimmy was already inside.  And Elo's like, I have, I could only imagine what he's doing in there. 
[01:39:00]  I have to get back in there immediately.  I'm like, what's going on?  And Elo's like, he's in rare form, right out of the box.  Jimmy goes to these things on a mission.  He's on a mission.  It has nothing to do with enjoying yourself and just having some nice food.  It all takes a back seat to the mission at hand.  And that mission is to either get photographs with famous people that he does not yet have  photographs with, and or to get those photographs signed by the person. 
[01:39:30]  On some occasions, yes.  Not always.  A lot of times I don't need to get the picture signed.  No.  First of all, I got to thank Eric, obviously, Elo, and Hojo, right?  Hojo is amazing.  Everyone has an O name, by the way.  Yes.  XM.  It's mandatory.  But can I...  Cheater has one, too.  Dick O.  Okay.  The first.  The first.  First of many.  Slur has been thrown out.  First of many.  I got to explain, too, when Jimmy goes to these things with his camera and stuff, even 
[01:40:00]  though they tell you you can't bring a camera and they don't want you taking photos.  He's got his.  He's got his, which is fine.  I mean, you know, you can try to work around the rules.  I just was like, well, I still don't have a camera because I lost mine at the Comedy  Cellar.  And I saw some flashes going off from people's cameras, so obviously it was being done.  Exactly.  People using their cell phones and stuff.  Yeah, it was being done.  But he also sets it up where he has to have an assistant.  Yeah.  I used to be the assistant, but I can't handle it anymore.  Too much pressure, right?  A lot of people around here have been the Jim Norton picture-taking assistant. 
[01:40:30]  I gave up after the Metallica ordeal where we were backstage for an  hour and a half, me and Bill Burr and Jimmy and Bill and I are getting bored and laughing  a little too much backstage.  It's like, they're going to throw us out.  They're going to throw us out before I get my pictures.  That was the last day I was Jimmy's assistant, even though even at that event I bailed and  I think Bill ended up getting the pictures for you.  So Roland is the new date, the new picture-taking guy for Jim Norton. 
[01:41:00]  Because, I mean, Jimmy, you know, he's not going to just hand his camera off to anyone  because that person could screw up the shot.  He gives you a speech the whole time.  And look, look, if Derek Jeter comes up, what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you the  camera.  I'm going to check it.  I'm going to check it about a hundred times, make sure it's set, and make sure, you know,  we're in focus.  And he explains the whole thing.  Yeah.  The whole thing.  You got one shot.  One shot.  Don't you screw it up.  You have to be prepared.  It gets to the point, though, if you're Jimmy's assistant in these situations, you're literally 
[01:41:30]  shaking as you take the picture because you know you only have one shot.  But don't shake.  And you know all hell's going to break loose if you don't do it right.  Because at one time, hold on, because now I'm getting into this, at OzFest in Philly,  I was his assistant.  I was going around getting the pictures, right?  Yeah.  And I got a picture of Jimmy and Rob Zombie, but it was in front of a glass panel.  Yeah.  It was a perfect shot, I got to tell you.  But the flash from the camera was in the middle of them, but it didn't take away from, I swear,  it didn't take away from anything. 
[01:42:00]  But it was distracting to look at the big white flash in the window.  And he was bummed out.  He was bummed out by a little flash that was literally like, you know, halfway down their  body.  So it was nowhere near their faces.  You could still see their bodies perfectly.  He's like, oh, look at this.  Later got taken out of Photoshop.  Yeah.  I wasn't angry.  I was just like, oh, man, do you think this is still cool?  I wasn't mad.  You were bummed.  A little bummed.  But then you fixed it in post-production.  And I'll tell you one thing, two things, actually.  One, I know I'm crazy about it.  That's part of my OCD.  But a couple of times at that Metallica thing, Ben, who never asked for pictures, when Lars 
[01:42:30]  came over and was introduced to me by Brewer, Ben's like, oh, could you get me one?  It's Lars.  He understood at that moment.  And it wasn't at that moment.  We were backstage forever.  And you drove.  We had no choice.  We had no choice.  When you and I went to XM to watch Robert Plant do it, you wanted a picture.  Absolutely.  There are certain, I'll tell you something.  You're right.  But that's normal stuff.  There's certain times, yes, you do want to take a picture. 
[01:43:00]  But with you, it doesn't matter.  It's with everybody.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  You saw with the Plant thing, though.  Some guys are really hard to get.  Really hard to get.  Plant's one of them.  And we both got them because it was set up right.  I know it's annoying, but sometimes you got to do it.  And it helped me with Sabbath.  All those years of preparation got me.  Hold on, Jimmy.  The Sabbath picture.  Hold on.  The perfect picture.  Hold on.  In all fairness, you and I got to see Robert Plant.  It was ours confidential.  It was me and Jimmy literally in front of Robert Plant.  Five feet away. 
[01:43:30]  As he's singing like he's singing in front of girls.  It was a little strange.  He was warming up.  He was warming up.  He was doing his sound check.  And it was just Jimmy and I in the front row like idiots with Robert Plant in this huge  Robert Plant package.  Did it look like he was smuggling a grapefruit?  We're like, here's the difference, though.  The whole time we were down there for the Robert Plant thing, all you thought about was the  picture.  Yes.  To me, it was like, wow, this is cool.  Robert Plant.  Hopefully, maybe I'll get a picture.  But you were talking to Lee Abrams and everybody else down there over and over again where it 
[01:44:00]  got back to Elon and everybody else that you were just a complete nuisance.  Who cares?  But that's what I'm getting at.  Like the Dirk Jeter thing yesterday.  If I got a few pictures here and there, yeah, that would have been cool.  Spike Lee was there.  I would have liked a picture with Spike Lee.  Sure.  But it didn't happen and I didn't really try.  But with you, it's all about pictures.  And then the actual having fun part is...  That's what's fun to me.  I don't like to watch a bunch of ballplayers go, you know, did you hit 40 home runs?  Was it a lot of fun that year? 
[01:44:30]  That's not fun for me.  Going to the entourage party is not fun for me.  I have nothing in common with them.  I'm honest to God.  But isn't it fun just to be part of the experience?  No.  See?  It's fun for me to be part of the experience.  I don't drink.  But it seems that...  I don't drink.  I don't fit in with them.  None of them know.  I'm not even talking about the drinking part of it.  Just being at the entourage premiere, that would have been cool to me.  But it seems like the photo part isn't fun for you either.  That is fun for me.  Because it's too much pressure. 
[01:45:00]  So that turns out to be not fun for you.  When things are set up, and once in a while you can, and most times you can't.  When I know I'm going to get it and things are cool, here's the thing that's key in life.  As a performer, you want backstage access.  Right.  Just because you're used to having it at your own shows, when that's set up, everything's cool.  But that to me, then it doesn't become about the photo thing.  Because you know that that's happening, that's the cool part.  But when you've got to sneak in there as a fan, and you've got to work for it, well, I've learned through trial and error how to do it. 
[01:45:30]  It's fun to do.  I like doing it.  It's a pain in the ass sometimes.  But look, that's why I have the collection I have.  People are like, dude, you have a lot of photos.  I have an update at eatabullet.com.  Don't dump out.  There's no porn on my site.  Eatabullet.com is my website.  I haven't updated it in probably a year and a half with photos.  And I probably have an extra hundred and something pictures.  And when you do, it's going to be interesting to look at.  I like doing it.  So you brought a camera.  You brought photos to be signed. 
[01:46:00]  You brought a couple different Sharpies just in case one's not working right.  What else?  I told you about two photos.  I have a photo with Jeter, which I got at XM.  And again, let me, before I start, thank Eric and thank Hojo.  Eric invited us to this dinner and did everything.  XM was great.  I mean, got us in, got me the access.  And I get there and Hojo hands me, he goes, dude, I hooked you up.  He hands me a signed Jeter picture.  Yeah.  And a signed Jeter ball.  Nice.  Amazing.  We all got that.  It was amazing. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  And that made me very happy.  I think he had to pay for that.  He was the only way to admit it, but I think he did.  I think he had to pay for that because they were selling them for the charity, which is fine.  So if he did.  They actually got him in his house last night.  He went to his house and got him in his house after the game yesterday afternoon.  Or two days ago.  Well, that was absolutely fantastic.  And it wasn't even about that.  Yeah, it's Friday.  It was amazing.  I just want to let you know.  I'm an idiot.  So what I bought was this.  I have a photo with Joe Thornton.  Still Thursday for you.  Which I got in 97.  And I have one photo with Jeter, which I got at XM actually in January because he's XM baseball's face. 
[01:47:00]  Right.  Which Stephanie tried to kick me out of the dressing room and she did kick me out of the dressing room.  And then somebody else got me the picture.  I think Lee got me the picture.  Oh, boy.  Was it Jamie?  No, no.  That wasn't January.  That wasn't a good day either.  Why would it be?  Why?  Right.  Somebody who works for the company throwing on-air talent out of the room because I understand that he's Jeter.  But you know what?  I do kind of work for you.  And I do kind of work for you in a visible capacity.  I know you hate me.  But could you fake it?  Yeah, we saw some research yesterday.  You better start treating us nice.  I mean, really.  Hilo and Hojo, I mean, sincerely. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, it was very, very cool that you got us in and you didn't have to do that.  It's genuinely appreciated.  Right.  I'm not just saying that because it's the right thing to say.  So I hate the Yankees.  Well, I mean, listen to me.  They're your favorite team though, Jimmy.  I hate this team.  But they're your favorite team.  I'm not even kidding.  Not even the Yankees as a team.  Hate them.  He hates the individual members that make up the Yankees.  All of them.  All of them.  None of them are nice.  Please, when we get back from our long weekend, come in here with the Boston Red Sox cap. 
[01:48:00]  Absolutely.  We'd love to see Boston smash their faces.  You know what?  I'll say this.  Ortiz, Ben interviewed him.  He said he was in a rush, but he was a nice guy.  I've heard so much about how these guys are nice guys.  They're so friendly.  They're not friendly.  What an arrogant group of asses this whole organization is.  Can I tell you?  I can't believe I am saying this.  Can I tell you what I saw when I got to our table? 
[01:48:30]  All right.  Jimmy, completely miserable.  Well, the event started 10 minutes, only 10 minutes in.  Roland looked like he was like an abused wife.  He was a wreck.  I know.  Roland was sweating so bad, and he looked like he was going to have a nervous breakdown.  His suit was all in a disarray.  His hair was all screwed up.  I remember, Roland was shaking.  Roland's whole job was to be Jimmy's assistant.  For 10 minutes.  As far as trying to get pictures taken. 
[01:49:00]  Roland.  See, look, he's smiling now.  He's freshly showered.  He's relaxed.  Roland sweats because there's some kind of a weird foreign thing running through his veins.  Roland sweats in Antarctica.  He can't help himself.  And he's good at this, and he's comfortable in these situations.  Roland was not nervous.  He didn't care.  But I did mess up on one picture.  The Posada.  That was probably my fault, though.  Posada?  What went through your head when you realized you messed up the picture?  I didn't blame him.  I was like, oh, Jesus.  I think I messed up.  Jimmy ran down to get Jorge.  Jorge looked so annoyed at me. 
[01:49:30]  That was an idiot that couldn't take a picture.  But I wasn't mad at him.  But he wasn't nervous about it.  He knew what he was doing.  So I get to that.  We've got to get through the got him, got him, need him, got him, need him, need him,  got him list that Jimmy got last night.  All right.  We will.  So I get to the table.  Roland is just a nervous wreck.  Jimmy is miserable.  Do you know how he does Frank the Frowner?  Yeah.  Oh, it was for real.  There was no smiles to be had yesterday.  And then all I hear him is whispering under his breath, I hate my life and I should just  kill myself.  Because I'm not a player.  And I've always known I'm not a player. 
[01:50:00]  Like, I mean, like, I'm not a force in this business.  He's like, you're on the road to Playerville.  I'm an unrecognizable nothing.  Wait, Anthony, I memorized all of them.  Who am I kidding?  I'm nobody.  I just started thinking I might be somebody.  I obviously am nobody.  I'm going nowhere in this business.  I hate my life.  I hate myself.  I should just kill myself.  When you saw me, here's what happened.  I brought my sign with Jeter, a picture with Jeter and a picture with Tori.  They're selling things here for charity. 
[01:50:30]  They don't want you to bring in baseballs and Yankee calendars to get signed.  It's about a charity.  And half of these scumbag memorabilia people ask you to sign things.  They sell on eBay.  Or they go rip people off with them.  And I understand the players don't want to be bothered.  They don't want to be signing that kind of crap.  Understandable.  This was a photo of me and him.  So I walk down.  I walk in.  Jeter is actually taking pictures for charity and for money.  All the money goes to charity. 
[01:51:00]  I have a picture with him.  I said, let me see if I can get him to sign it.  He walks out.  The security is going, get back, get back, get back, get back, get back, get back.  Let it be known Jimmy went early because Jimmy knows how to get pictures done, by the way.  He's the expert.  So like the average schmo would get there when they tell you to get there.  He gets there a little early knowing that they're going to be arriving themselves.  Instinctively, I know you have to do this.  So I have the marker out.  And my picture, I'm like, let me just ask him when he comes out.  So I'm holding it out.  It couldn't have been easier.  He walks up. 
[01:51:30]  And I'm like, could you sign this picture of us?  And he goes, sorry, buddy, I've got to do an interview.  And he pats me on the shoulder.  I'm annoyed, but I understand.  Okay, you've got to do it.  But the first time I met Ozzy, he goes, I said, hey, man, could you sign this?  I can't, man.  I've got this TV thing.  And he walked by me.  And then when I met him 15 minutes later, I go, could you sign this?  He goes, sure, man.  You know why?  Because Ozzy is not a liar.  He's real.  He's not a phony.  He's a phony.  That's why.  Yeah.  And then now, what happened after that? 
[01:52:00]  Well, 30 seconds after this, some broad calls him over.  And, of course, he stops to talk to the broad.  Because they're the ones that are buying your jerseys, right?  Stupid.  The chicks.  Well, the chicks do buy the pink Yankees.  Yeah, I know they do.  They're the ones that knew who you were when you were still in AAA ball.  Those are the ones that liked you when you were a rookie.  Those are the ones that know that you're number two.  Jackass.  Those are the ones, the chicks.  They say he's got nice buns.  They don't know if it's you or Tino from the back, stupid. 
[01:52:30]  So, anyway, he walks over to talk to these broads.  And then, mister, I'm in a rush for an interview.  They hustle him in the back for another picture with chicks.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Fletcher had an interview to do.  Oh, I get it.  I'm just a jerk off standing there waiting for a picture to be signed.  Yeah.  I get it.  So, that's why I was annoyed when you saw me.  Yeah.  That's why.  Because it was phony.  And I knew it was phony. 
[01:53:00]  And I saw it in his face.  Look, I am maybe one thousandth the fame he is.  But I have stood and signed four or five hundred autographs after a theater show.  Yeah.  I've had those occasions where it's been annoying and I've had to sign.  Never have I turned down a fan with a picture of them.  I've never turned down a fan to begin with.  Never with a picture of me and that person.  Mm-hmm.  You know it's not going anywhere.  Okay.  He didn't want to sign it.  And Roland, you saw it. 
[01:53:30]  He didn't want to do it.  It wasn't, I'm in a rush.  There's a camera.  I got to go.  It was, he didn't want to do it.  So I go back to the table and believe me, there's more.  And that's why I was annoyed when you first saw me.  And I know a lot of the fans are going to kill me today.  He's complaining.  I don't care.  No, this is a great rant.  This was all that, this was what made the event so interesting.  I came in, I guess about this time.  I was late.  You were way late.  I was way late.  You missed most of the action with him.  Because I was livid myself.  You missed. 
[01:54:00]  Downpour.  Trying to get a cab in New York City.  With Elo calling like every 15 minutes or so.  Where are you?  Hey, where are you?  Just sitting behind a savage trying to get down a Broadway like a half a mile.  Not even.  And it took at least 45 minutes to get maybe 10 blocks.  Because of the rain and the pedestrians and just people. 
[01:54:30]  So I finally got there.  And when I sat down, I looked over at Ope.  Ope turned around, smiled.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Jimmy was sitting there like hunched over, mumbling to himself.  I don't think I've ever had more fun hanging out with Jimmy, by the way.  Because he was so miserable.  I get into that like you wouldn't believe.  Ice, when you saw me, the first time Ope saw me, it was right after that happened.  And Roland saw it too.  Roland understands what I'm talking about.  The difference between, I'm not an idiot. 
[01:55:00]  I understand what, I don't know how much XM paid for this table.  It was $20,000.  Okay, so you know that me being there, there was a $20,000 investment that I was involved  with somehow.  It was the generosity of XM.  But you know that I was there for some reason.  And it was not, could you sign this ball, DJ?  It was a picture of you and me.  And you know what?  When the first time I met him at XM, I didn't care for him that much.  He took the picture with me.  He didn't want to.  I believe, I've signed enough autographs. 
[01:55:30]  Sorry I don't have 34 Ds, stupid.  I just have B-cups.  Can we take a break and then we'll get into part two?  Yes, because I hate the rest of the team too.  We'll get into...  None of you are nice guys.  One of you is a nice guy.  Oh, one?  One of you.  Find out who.  Anthony, this is what you missed just before you arrived.  Jimmy is livid, right?  But all of a sudden, Jim Larritz, I always say his name wrong, Larritz, Larritz.  Just call him phony number 30.  Jim Larritz, who was on our show. 
[01:56:00]  And gave us an amazing interview and was admitting to, you know, popping pills and all that crap.  How long did we hang out with him for?  Three hours?  We must have hung out with him a half hour here and then another hour, hour and a half at XM.  Two hours.  Let's call it two hours.  Easy, okay?  This is the tease.  So, Jimmy is livid, but now he's trying to make a comeback.  He's trying to rally.  He sees Jim Larritz at the table next to us.  He goes, oh, Jim, he was on our show recently.  Yeah, there's a name.  Gets up to say hi to Jim Larritz and we'll tell you what happened next.  Oh, boy.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America. 
[01:56:30]  Opie and Anthony here.  Let's make this simple.  We're away for a while.  Here's a funny segment.  See you after New Year's.  Peace.  It's truly a shame we just had to play commercials.  He's still going.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  So, we should get right back into this.  We're at the Dirk Jeter thing last night.  What have we learned so far?  Dirk Jeter dissed him as far as taking a picture.  On purpose.  Or having the picture that Jimmy brought with him signed.  Gave an excuse about he had something to do. 
[01:57:00]  Walked away and then proceeded to take some pictures with some young ladies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was at the XM table.  XM paid $20,000 for the event.  Yeah.  I arrived all happy and I got even happier when I saw how miserable Jimmy was.  You're terrible.  Usually when someone is miserable, it brings you down.  Yeah.  I was giggling like a little girl.  I got to be honest with you.  When he was saying how he's a nobody and he hates his life and he should just kill himself. 
[01:57:30]  You're on the road.  It made me very, very happy.  Because, again, when he wouldn't sign the picture, I was cool with it.  Like, all right, whatever, man.  He's got to go do a press junket.  But then when he stopped and talked to the chick, he could have signed eight pictures.  And then he went back into the room and took pictures with two chicks.  Yeah.  Sorry, I didn't realize that it was chicks that want to cut their wrists when the Yankees lost in 2001.  Sorry, I didn't realize it was a bunch of chicks that liked you when you were a rookie.  You idiot. 
[01:58:00]  You typical ass of an athlete.  Dude, I hate athletes.  Hate them.  You're a bunch of dummies.  They're dumb jocks.  And Layritz, you mentioned Layritz before.  All right.  So, yeah, let's get right into it.  I got to know what happened now.  Let's get to him.  Because I thought we had a relationship with the guy.  So did I.  So Jimmy is trying to calm down and get it together because he knows it's still early on.  So maybe some things could possibly happen because he's always thinking, maybe I could salvage this night, right?  And so then Jim Layritz is standing right behind Elo, basically, where he was sitting. 
[01:58:30]  He was right there.  We just had him on the show.  So I go, Jimmy, Jim Layritz.  And he's like, oh, wow.  I think you even said he knows us.  Yeah, he did the show.  Cool, you know?  So he gets up like this is going to be his rallying point.  This is going to rally him to get him back into an okay place where he could try to focus to get more pictures and maybe the Derek Jeter picture signed.  Or just feel like not so much a piece of garbage.  So say hi to one of the Yankees and they know me.  So Jimmy jumps up. 
[01:59:00]  I just sat down because I already knew how this was going to play out.  And I swear that's the only reason I didn't get up because I just know.  And I think you knew in the back of my head.  In the back of my head, I did because I know that they're all phonies.  I'll say one thing about comics.  Basically, in most cases, what you see is what you get.  Yeah.  That guy you see a month from now or two weeks from now is going to say hello to you again.  So I tap Layritz on the thing with my stupid, typical non-man tap fingers. 
[01:59:30]  And he turns and he looks.  I go, hey, Jim.  And he said hello.  He goes, hey, man.  That was exactly the tone.  Hey, man.  And he shook my hand.  And I've shaken a lot of hands in my life.  Yeah.  It was the absolute look of I know I've seen you.  I don't know where.  I don't care where.  Turn back around.  Oh, there was not one ounce of recognition that we had spent two hours together talking and laughing. 
[02:00:00]  I'm glad your wife took your ring, stupid.  What do you think of them apples?  Them apples.  What else did she take?  Your memory of people you hung out with?  Phony athlete.  All of them.  I hate their guts.  But he walked down the street with us.  He walked in the walkover with us.  Yeah.  The walkover.  I saw Layritz again by the bathroom an hour later.  It was so awful.  And look, let me cut anybody off at the pass.  It's a big event.  He's excited.  There's other Yankees there.  I don't expect him to throw his arms around me. 
[02:00:30]  My God, Jim Dorton.  I thought of nothing but you.  I didn't even care if he remembered my name.  A handshake.  Hey, man.  How are you?  A genuine half a second hello.  Yeah.  Oh, I was after.  I didn't have a picture to be signed.  It was honest to God.  I'll call myself out when I'm being a piece of garbage.  This was a genuine hello was all I wanted.  Nothing.  No, right.  I saw him in the bathroom like outside the bathroom because this was the beauty.  I'm in the bathroom.  Yogi Berra's in the bathroom.  I'm like, oh, my God. 
[02:01:00]  They got to use the same bathroom the rest of us do.  So I go in.  I grab sweaty, far-headed Roland.  I drag him out.  I'm like, dude, they're all going to the bathroom.  It was a wreck at this point.  He can't even keep his shirt tucked in.  He's so nervous.  I saw Layritz an hour later.  I go, hey, man.  I said, hi again.  He goes, hey.  And it was such an awful hello.  I go, do you remember me?  And he goes, yeah, how are you?  Oh, he didn't.  He did, but he just didn't give a crap.  He didn't care.  That was why I hate him today. 
[02:01:30]  Well, he's not a f***er.  Dude, I don't care.  Not that he wouldn't care.  The common decency.  The common courtesy.  Because he did have a good time on the air.  And we treated him great.  And we're celebrities just like him.  No, exactly.  We're not.  And I understand that.  I understand that.  I'm very realistic about that.  I don't expect him to throw his arms around me.  Man, this is right up there with the 96 three-run homer.  I don't expect that.  He only hit one of the greatest homers in Yankee history.  They're all dicks.  The whole team is dicks. 
[02:02:00]  I can't believe I hate the Yankees.  Go Sox, right?  Go Sox.  Go Sox, right?  Dude, I am heartbroken.  I can't believe I hate that.  My Mets are going to kick your Sox ass.  I can't believe it.  Okay, so I walk out.  Although they didn't do too well.  I see Ron Guidry.  The Gator.  Oh, my God.  18 strikeouts against California Angels.  On the 78.  They're one of my childhood idols.  Any girl would know these stats, by the way.  Absolutely.  Any chick would know these.  Right.  You stupid athletes. 
[02:02:30]  You jackasses.  So, again, I say, he took a picture with me.  I said, hey, Gator, I'm like, hey, man, can I get a quick shot?  Camera setups, I know.  Security is with these guys when they come out.  You've got to have your camera guy shaking in his boots so it's all set up, ready to go.  And it's a respect thing.  I'm not going to fish through a camera while this guy stands here at a big, I know it's  got to be ready and done.  That's what turns them off to pictures, by the way.  These idiots that don't know how to get it done. 
[02:03:00]  These dumb guys, and I've been through this.  Not like you have, Derek, but I've been through it enough where some idiot with his stupid  fat broad has a camera phone.  It's a one.  I'm dialing 911.  Hit send, whore.  Save it.  I swear to God, dude, camera phones, I'm going to smash them against your teeth.  They have ruined it for everybody.  Stop asking me to take pictures with you with a camera phone.  I'm going to bite your phone in your girlfriend's face.  Big, dopey, pixelated, nothing, dark, grainy picture. 
[02:03:30]  Can I jump in for one second?  I get it.  Jump in for one second.  Nelson from Jersey.  Table at the Dirk Jeter event, 20 grand.  Digital camera, 400 bucks.  Sharpies, $3.  Jimmy losing his mind over being a nobody.  Priceless.  Of course.  Guidry took the picture because I was prepared.  It's nice.  But he wasn't nice.  Do you understand again?  Oh, no.  He wasn't rude.  I thought this was a good one.  No.  None of them are good except one. 
[02:04:00]  But you got the picture.  They were douche after douche after douche.  A bunch of entitled douches.  I hate this team.  And I loved the Yankees.  Of course you did.  Loved them.  And my job is to observe.  We all know that.  So another observation, they're starting to come back to me now that we're all waking up.  So we're at the table.  Now the Jim Lerner's thing happens.  He is just miserable.  He comes back.  And I'm just like, I can't get enough of Jimmy miserable. 
[02:04:30]  And then all of a sudden, I'm like, Jimmy, I'm not sure if I said this, but it was very apparent that some people were sneaking.  See, the banquet room, we were in the middle, a bunch of tables.  The front of the room was where all the athletes were sitting with their wives and friends and family and stuff.  But it looked like we were all in the same room.  But we really weren't.  I said to Jimmy, I think, if not, correct me.  I'm like, Jimmy, people are sneaking to the front of the room to get pictures before the event starts.  I saw it.  I saw that. 
[02:05:00]  So all of a sudden, all of a sudden, rolling, rolling, rolling, up, up, rolling up.  Poor Roland, man.  The switch is dripping off his forehead.  What, what?  So Roland's up again as his assistant to get the picture done.  And they start walking to the front of the room.  I look at Elo and Lindsey, and I'm like, oh, boy, this ain't going to be good.  Well, they got it cut off at the pad.  Security is in every little table aisle.  They have a big security guard.  So you can't go where the guards are sitting.  20,000 a table. 
[02:05:30]  You can't mingle with the guards.  You know, the guys that are taller than you and treat you like garbage in high school with the jocks.  You can't mingle with the guards because they're going to eat better food than we're getting, I'm sure.  But, you know, I can almost understand that.  Because half of these mooks would walk up with a ball while a guy is eating.  Could you sign this?  And get with Gravion.  I can understand them wanting some privacy with their families.  It was annoying, but I can understand that.  Again, I am not unrealistic.  I'm not a dummy. 
[02:06:00]  I understand these guys are bothered all the time.  Guidry, back to Guidry.  Took the picture.  Didn't want to.  The most insincere.  Yeah, thank you.  Yeah, beat it, stupid.  You haven't thrown a pitch in 20 years.  You're lucky I'm saying hello to you.  I just shot an HBO special.  I don't think I'd die.  He took the picture, but you could tell.  He wanted nothing to do with it.  What did the picture come out like?  Did he look like he doesn't want to be there?  No, of course not.  They all know when to put their teeth on.  But, Jimmy.  They all know when to smile.  But, Jimmy, how does this play on your head?  You want, like, an exchange of numbers? 
[02:06:30]  Nope.  And you fast forward and there you are having lunch.  It would run.  Absolutely not.  Just a thank you from one human being to another.  Look, I've met enough fans.  I've met enough fans where I know the difference between an annoying fan and a guy just getting a quick shot.  Now, I've got to get into your head a little bit.  Is that Guidry picture now tainted to you?  No, no, no, no.  I got the picture.  He did take it.  Whatever.  I'm just saying, when you see it as a whole picture with all of these guys, you just realize they're dicks. 
[02:07:00]  They're dicks.  Go Sox.  Go Sox, right, Jimmy?  Go Sox?  Back at Dane Cook Show I met.  There was three of them backstage at the Dane Cook Show.  Yeah.  A quick hello.  And, again, I know it was backstage, not a baseball event.  They were very friendly.  Ben Matt Ortiz, he said he was friendly.  Whatever.  I'm sure some of them are jerks, too.  I'm sure they all are.  All athletes are.  They all are.  They don't make their living with their personalities.  That's why they don't mix well.  And, again, I know the fans deserve to be crapped on once in a while because they're awful.  That's why I set it up properly.  Because I know what annoys me and I know what's not going to annoy me. 
[02:07:30]  So, Guidry, eh.  You know who the greatest one was, and I'll never badmouth him again.  Oh, here it is.  Who?  Jason Giambi.  This guy came out, went to the bathroom, and he really didn't want to.  By the way, at this point, another observation, Jimmy's gone with poor Roland.  They're gone.  Yes.  And then I find out later that Jimmy decided to camp out outside the men's room to get to his pictures.  Best place to get your photos.  Just completely camped out.  I felt like Robert Reed.  I was just hanging outside the men's room.  And the bathroom wasn't in a place where it would be normal to just hang outside the men's 
[02:08:00]  room.  It was in a very awkward, like, nowhere's land type of area.  But every time you saw security, see, this was the beauty of it.  You'd see a black guy with a...  And the security guys were actually...  They were doing their jobs.  They were okay.  I mean, look, they got a job to do.  They didn't want some dummy with a camera phone.  Where the heck?  Could you stop?  That time you had eight runs.  Right.  So, who was the next one that came by?  Who was the next one that came by?  It was Guidry.  Oh, I just lost my train of thought. 
[02:08:30]  Damn it.  Giambi.  Yeah, Giambi.  Okay.  Stopped and signed for everybody.  Took a picture with everybody.  There was probably about 50 or 60 people that asked him.  He doesn't want any negative press or anything.  But it was almost like he was just a nice dude, man.  Yeah.  And, like, I understand.  This is a dinner.  These guys don't want to be bothered.  They're bothered every day.  But he was just pleasant.  Did he say, hey, Giambino?  Yeah, Giambino.  No, I didn't say that. 
[02:09:00]  I just said, hey, man, I'm friends with Brody Stevens and Yoshi because he knows about anyone.  Hey, okay.  He, like, didn't care, but he took the picture anyway.  Nice guy.  Yeah.  I was very impressed.  I'll never badmouth him again because he wasn't a douche to the fans.  I mean, I know that all fans are burdens unless we're mediocre-looking women.  I understand that because, again, you're right.  Those are the ones that care when you lose.  Those are the ones that can tell you what games were won and lost to the 2001 World Series, Derek.  It's the chick you took the picture with when you blew me off the first time and after you blew me off again. 
[02:09:30]  You're a stalker, man.  And it wasn't over.  Someone's saying inbred pest from PA.  Jimmy, did you say, but, Derek, you're the champ.  No, I didn't say anything.  Hey, can I pat myself on the back?  I don't know.  Lawrence, with a fine observation.  On the flip side, I met Opie and Lindsay at Newark Airport last year, and he couldn't be nicer.  He stopped walking, came back over to shake hands, started a conversation.  Just a cool guy.  Now that I think of it, maybe I met Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie in the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:10:00]  Could have been.  Could have been.  Let's see who else was an absolute douche.  Okay.  Okay, Guidry was tolerable, kind of a dick vibe.  At one point, Tino Martinez walked out.  All right, very good.  I've been waiting by the bathroom like an absolute creep.  It's a good find.  So he's walking towards me.  I go, Tino, can I get a quick shout out to you?  And he looked annoyed.  I go, when you're done?  I thought he was going to the bathroom.  What's he do?  The security walks him through an exit door.  They walk him through the exit and he leaves.  So that was my fault. 
[02:10:30]  But he's a dick, and I saw it in your face, stupid.  When you're done leaving?  Yeah, when you're done.  Like, maybe next season, if you get re-signed.  Robinson Cano, the rookie, one of the biggest d*** ever.  You are a d***, dude.  You're a d***.  And I got a picture with him.  He took the picture.  Of course he did.  Thank God he did.  He scared you.  He stopped.  I had the camera.  I'm like, hey, Robinson.  What would he have been if he didn't take a picture? 
[02:11:00]  I'm like, hey, Robinson, can I get a picture?  He goes, all right, man, quick.  Make it quick.  You don't want to say that to Jimmy.  Why would you say that?  Dude, at this point, honest to God, it was me and Roland, maybe two people in this area.  There was nobody there.  It was you and what was left of Roland.  There was nobody out there.  That poor kid obviously needs friends desperately to agree to hang out with you.  It was not a mob scene.  Right.  There was nobody out there.  Okay?  There was nobody out there. 
[02:11:30]  I understand if there was a bunch of people.  There was not a bunch of people.  It was empty out there because I knew where to stand and started Roland.  Great moment.  Opie actually got me the best moment of the night.  The only good moment of the night for me.  Because in the end, I do look out for you.  You absolutely do.  As much as I enjoy you being miserable, I also have your back at all times.  Security had to walk these guys, right?  So we would go.  We saw security walking one of the players towards the bathroom.  Me and Roland would sneak out the front door and go by the bathroom and wait.  He had the whole plan.  So what happened?  Oh, Georgie Posada. 
[02:12:00]  I see him walking.  And as he's walking out, I'm like, okay, I want to get a picture.  And the security guy goes, let me go to the bathroom first.  I'm like, all right, because I kind of feel like a dick.  So then Posada's coming out.  I had done a benefit for his wife.  She runs some organization.  So I did a benefit.  I performed at Stand Up New York for her.  So you got an in.  None of the players came, of course, because their names weren't on it.  I guess if it's not going to help your public relations face, so you can get a sneaker endorsement,  why would you show up for it?  But when he came out of the bathroom, I go, believe me, you've got to throw out whatever you got. 
[02:12:30]  I said, hey, man, I performed to the benefit for your wife.  And he goes, oh, okay, man.  Look, you need to get a quick picture.  He didn't want to stop, but he did because of that.  And I had the camera set to black and white, so it came out wrong.  And I'm panicking.  Oh, no.  And I'm like, George, the picture didn't come out.  And he reluctantly stopped again, and we got the picture.  Wow.  Would have been a dick, believe me.  Dick, but was okay, because I did a benefit for his wife.  Poor Roland.  Did you punch him in the face after it came out black and white?  No, absolutely not.  It was my fault.  It was my fault.  I'm not.  It was my fault.  1945 Roland.  Next time you'll listen.  Roland. 
[02:13:00]  Poor Roland.  Oh, no, this sweat probably dropped onto the button and moved it.  Was it in, like, sepia tone?  Yeah, exactly.  It was.  It was.  It looked like an oldie-style Babe Ruth picture.  The highlight of my night came when Opal.  By the end of the night, Roland looked like he just got released from a Mexican prison.  Oh, yeah.  He was in shambles when I saw him.  Shambles.  He was just done, man.  You know, it's like a tour of duty going on a picture detail with Jim. 
[02:13:30]  You just don't want to do it.  It's like being on point in the nom.  Like I said, we've got to get Bill Burr on the phone to back me up.  After the Metallica thing, I was done.  I can't be his camera assistant anymore, because I like my friendship with Jimmy,  and this will break up our friendship.  I got a deferment so I don't have to ever take pictures for him.  Deferment.  Man, you don't go out enough to be able to hang out with Jimmy.  Thank God.  I'm annoyed that I didn't get the Tino picture.  That's my fault.  Highlight of my night came when Op goes, come here, come here, come here, come here.  Spike Lee right there.  Now, I love. 
[02:14:00]  Spike Lee was one of the honorees.  The honorees were Spike Lee, Dave Winfield, Joe Torre.  Ollie was supposed to be, but he didn't show up, did he, Derek?  Good.  Maybe he knows you're a dick.  He's going to be at the Chicago one that they do.  This is all over the country, and they hold another one in Chicago.  Yeah.  So he's going to be at that one.  I'm sure you'll be invited.  Is he really?  But they had a video presentation of him and his wife, and, dude, I don't even know why  you want Ali there.  It's Ali.  Dude, he's Ali.  No, he's not.  He's one of the greatest guys to ever live. 
[02:14:30]  Ali died years ago.  He's mentally the same guy.  That guy in that shell that is just shaking.  I felt so bad during that video presentation.  He couldn't say word one.  He sat there.  His wife spoke.  And his wife had to hold on to him.  And they're both shaking like it's earthquake footage.  Dude, he has blood.  And she's saying everything.  I know.  I mean, he can't talk.  But mentally, he's fine.  I don't think he was sitting on a paint shaker, Jim.  I know what he's got.  He's completely there.  Although, he could have been. 
[02:15:00]  I'm saying he's not like lost mentally.  He's not gone.  No.  Yeah.  He's still Ali.  He's just got points.  He was just leaning against the dryer.  He's fine.  And there was a couple of sneakers in there off balance.  Right.  The greatest athlete ever.  The guy could be.  He probably would have said like, Jimmy, I'll be right back.  And just left.  You're talking about the greatest athlete ever.  The greatest.  Don't even mention Babe Ruth, Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan.  I'll agree.  I'll agree. 
[02:15:30]  Greatest athlete ever.  Wait.  So, Spike Lee is walking by.  Thank you.  And, of course, Spike Lee.  So, I walk over to Spike.  And I always try to have my moment again.  Failure.  Just an unrecognizable nothing.  And he's with his kid.  But he's in the middle of the audience.  Do you have a Spike in?  Yeah.  Hi.  Hey, Spike.  I'm a white guy who can name more than just do the right thing.  Well, that's an in.  I meant it, too.  I told him I thought you were robbed with X in the Oscars.  I told him that.  And he's like, thank you.  And I just got a quick picture.  He wasn't friendly or unfriendly.  He was indifferent. 
[02:16:00]  But he's pretty much what I expected him to be.  Yeah.  He wasn't rude, nor was he polite.  All right.  But I thought if I met Spike Lee, he'd be a little bit nicer.  But, again, an event like that, you got your kid with you.  You don't want to be.  Okay.  I get it.  So he took the picture.  And I saw him later.  I said, good night.  He said, good night.  It was brief.  And that was that.  Yeah.  The highlight of the night comes when we see Derek being walked out.  And I know where he's going.  He's going to the bathroom.  Wait, is this the end of the night?  This is, guys, we're coming up.  Is this attempt number three, by the way? 
[02:16:30]  Two.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Attempt two.  Okay.  Attempt two.  Do we want to continue with this?  Of course we do.  Raise your hands.  Because we've got to take a break.  Raise your hands.  Damn breaks.  Because we have to get into the auction part.  Well, I want to hear about all the crap that went on, though, to the signatures.  Yeah.  And then the auction part.  Because at one point, the entire place turned around and looked at Jimmy.  Yeah.  And we'll tell you what happened with that.  He wanted to kill him.  And we'll tell you how it ended with the Derek Jeter thing.  Yeah.  All right.  It's the ONA virus. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, the gift basket.  It's the gift basket.  Oh, no.  Oh, the gift basket.  A lot of gifts.  Did you open it up when you got home and sort through the goods?  What the hell?  It's the day before a long weekend.  We'll continue with this because it's way too good.  We do have other things we really want to get to today.  We'll see.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We'll wrap up with Jimmy.  Hey, look.  If you're getting impatient listening to it, turn something else on. 
[02:17:30]  I don't know what to tell you.  No, I don't think they are.  No.  To be honest with you, the phones have never been hotter.  The instant feedback, it can't even update fast enough with everyone's comments.  Most people with you, by the way, Jimmy.  Most people with you.  I don't care.  I've never blown off a family in life.  Go Sox, right?  Yeah.  I hate the Yankees, dude.  For real.  I hate it.  And he hates that he hates the Yankees.  You don't understand.  Really?  Jimmy doesn't want to hate the Yankees.  He loves the Yankees.  But now it's all personal.  He's always loved the Yankees.  Of course he has.  Can I bring you to the dark side?  The Mets are doing great this year.  They suck. 
[02:18:00]  I never liked the Mets, dude.  I don't like that organization.  The Lil Brothers of the Yankees.  I respect Boston.  Lil Brothers.  Look at the standings.  It's the ONA virus spreading across.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We're almost done with Lil Jimmy Norton.  From last night at the Dirk Heater event here in New York City.  Man, if you're just tuning in, I'm sorry.  I don't know what to tell you.  It's been an unbelievable hour just listening to Jimmy have a meltdown. 
[02:18:30]  It was a big night.  You've got to listen longer to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  You're missing stuff.  It was a big night.  We all went to the Derek Jeter charity event.  This is Turn 2 charity.  He's been doing it for 10 years.  A lot of people show up.  And Jimmy's into getting the pictures taken with the celebrities and the sports figures.  And getting pictures that he has taken in the past that these people are autographed at the events.  And the collection all together.  And a lot of times he gets blown off and it gets him pissed off. 
[02:19:00]  To a point of pissed off that none of us can really relate to.  No, it's someone came in.  It's like Death Wish pissed off.  A group came in, maybe raped and killed your daughter.  Sent her to a mental institution.  Killed your wife.  Something like that.  That type of pissed off.  Paul Kersey pissed.  This brings him back to something that we don't know about yet.  This is the confirmation of just what a nothing I am. 
[02:19:30]  And I'm serious.  That's exactly what it is.  But you're on the road from nothing to kind of know yourville.  Exactly.  You're on an HBO show.  Exactly.  And nobody cares.  You were just on Tower Records.  Drop dead.  I read what you wrote today.  I'd like to bite your face too if you were here right now.  Wait, what did he do to you?  Just wrote that Lucky Louie has succeeded nothing more than being vulgar.  Sorry we used dirty language, scumbag Puritan post writer.  I hate the New York Post.  You know, I'm with you there.  John Minelli wrote an article on this show. 
[02:20:00]  Why would they publish it?  And they didn't even publish it.  No.  John Minelli listens every day.  I love you, bro.  But I'm done with your paper.  I'm done with your paper.  We could still be friends.  We could talk here and there.  But as far as doing interviews with you or anyone else at the Post, we're done with them.  He wrote a really nice article.  He sent it to me.  It was about the ratings and how we're having this massive comeback in radio.  It's one of the biggest radio stories ever.  And what are they doing as far as the radio section goes?  What was their big story today? 
[02:20:30]  I don't even know.  Don't even know?  I don't even know.  And then Minelli said, you know, it's going to be in the back section, which is a great part of the paper.  It's near the TV stuff, the place where most people go when they're reading the New York Post.  And then I wrote him and said, what's going on with the article?  He goes, well, now I think it's going to be in the business section on Tuesday.  And Tuesday, obviously, is what, three days ago at this point?  And there's no sign of this article.  Because someone at the Post just hates our guns.  The editor, I'm sure.  And they're Howard fans and all that BS.  Well, when they print Dopey Opie and Pervy Pal. 
[02:21:00]  I want to get their names.  I just want to start giving out their names on the air.  We don't need the New York Post to be successful.  So, John, I'm sorry to say we're done with the paper you worked for.  Done.  Done with them.  But anyway, go ahead, Jimmy.  I got to know what happened.  Back to douche.  At the event, I already mentioned we've covered a lot of ground.  Jeter's been walking towards the bathroom.  He's got four security guards with him.  This is your second attempt to get your picture signed. 
[02:21:30]  All I want, I don't want it personalized, just Derek and Jeter on a picture of me and him.  That's it.  So, I stand outside the bathroom.  One of the massive security guards I know from Caroline's, he was a guy there.  He's a nice dude.  Oh, there's an in.  He goes, hey, Jim.  Well, he couldn't do anything, but I knew he wouldn't push me away.  Uh-huh.  So, Derek walks out.  Dude, I have my picture, the pen read.  I have the pen open.  The cap isn't even on it.  It's in grab-it-and-sign position. 
[02:22:00]  It could take probably under a second.  Where's Roland?  Can Roland come in?  Oh, God.  Because he saw what happened.  He's barely standing up at this point.  He saw what happened.  Derek walks out.  I go, I even said, just in case he didn't see it was a picture of me and him.  Hey, man, can you sign this picture of me and you?  And he goes, not now, man.  I'll do it later.  Oh, the old later gag.  And I knew that he purposely looked at my face, didn't like me, and kept going. 
[02:22:30]  I knew, and Roland, you saw it.  Yeah, he had this look.  When he saw Jim, he was like, ah, not again.  He just didn't want to sign it.  He didn't want to sign it.  And I don't want to hear, well, it was a charity event.  He was only signing things that were paid for.  Because if that was the truth, then at the end of the night, I walked up to the stage, like all the other fans, all the Yankees are on stage.  I have a picture with Joe Torre.  Joe is getting mobs, and he goes on the stage.  So here's what my strategy is.  I stand there with my picture out and the pen with Joe. 
[02:23:00]  He can look and see.  It's a picture of me and him.  Torre recognized that it was a picture of us.  Walks over to the end of the stage, and he signs it for me.  Oh, nice.  Nice guy.  So you got Joe Torre to sign the picture.  Got Joe Torre to sign it.  All right.  Jeter, I stood there anyway.  Attempt number three.  Five times.  Looked over and did the, as soon as I looked, eye contact, look away.  This guy has something going on with him.  Dude, you're a goddamn phony.  You try to come off like you're this great guy. 
[02:23:30]  You're not a great guy.  You're a bum.  You're the greatest Yankee shortstop in history.  First ballot Hall of Famer.  They were going to retire your number.  No one is saying you're not the best shortstop in the history of the franchise.  You are.  You really are.  But what a jerk off you are.  And I saw it in your face.  I've signed enough autographs to know the difference.  You are a phony.  An absolute goddamn phony.  And as he's walking off the stage, dude, the guy's a superstar.  He's getting mobbed. 
[02:24:00]  I get it.  I get it.  He sees my picture five times.  Won't sign it.  Some dumb chick.  What did she say?  Oh, boy.  She said, I can't have your picture so I can put it up the next day at work for a screensaver.  That's what she said.  I can't have your picture so I can put it up the next day for my screensaver.  And he stops for her.  And picked her up on stage.  He stopped.  Well, he stopped.  Oh, my God.  Everybody rushes to the stage.  Security blocks it.  Derek starts to move because it's going to be crazy.  Derek stops again and has her come over so he can take the picture with her. 
[02:24:30]  So, again, if it's only about signing things for charity, then he never would have taken that picture, which he was also charging for.  So, sorry again.  I'm not a chick.  I'm sure in 2001, when the Yankees lost two, then won three, and then lost two, she was as depressed as I am.  But I'm sure after they won three and then dropped four straight to Boston, she was as bummed out as I was.  But remember, he signed her pocketbook, too.  Oh, did he sign the pocketbook, too?  It wasn't even the card.  That's exactly what you are as an athlete. 
[02:25:00]  You're a goddamn phony as an athlete.  That's exactly what you are.  I can't tell you how much I hate this guy now.  Do you hate who?  Jeter.  And the stars showed up in Times Square last night to support Derek Jeter and his Turn 2 Foundation.  This helps kids turn away from drugs.  Fox News' Lisa Evers has all the action from the annual fundraising dinner at the Marriott Marquis.  Ten years later, it's a decade of hits for Derek Jeter and his Turn 2 Foundation.  Some sports world heavy hitters came out to honor the Yankee superstar for his good deeds. 
[02:25:30]  It's gotten bigger and better than we ever imagined.  He has it.  Starting his foundation ten years ago in a hotel room with his father.  Now we can look back on all he's accomplished, raising millions of dollars to help thousands of kids in need.  And your host, the captain, number two, Derek Jeter.  What we try to do is help out as much as we can.  You know, we had support with our after-school programs.  Could you please display a personality?  Unfortunately, we've been able to touch a lot of kids' lives. 
[02:26:00]  He should be an operator for a living.  And look, hey, look, God bless him.  He's doing charity work.  And in fairness, his father was walking around.  Seems like the nicest guy on earth, Jeter's father.  Sorry, Mr. Jeter.  Your son is an entitled dick.  Wasn't he signing pictures for charity, though?  Could you, like, give him a couple hundred dollars and he would sign a picture?  Yeah, yeah.  Or you could have gotten the pictures.  And again, I don't...  That's a charity thing.  No problem.  But what I saw he did with that girl at the end.  When he called her up, stopped.  I didn't know he signed her purse. 
[02:26:30]  But you see, I want a picture for a screensaver.  Maybe that's the line you have for you.  You understand what I'm saying?  That any guy that's ever been blown off by one of these scumbag athletes, that's why.  I hate them.  I hate them for that.  I have never blown off a fan, dude.  I'm sorry I'm yelling so much.  It's not, you know, whatever.  I hear it in your voice now.  I've never done it.  You've got sets to do this weekend, Jimmy.  You've got to relax.  I have never refused.  And then the auction.  Oh, and the gift bag.  What a lovely...  And the auction sucked. 
[02:27:00]  What was the one they auctioned off?  Hey, winner, winner, you can train with Derrick's trainer and you can have his cook cook for you.  Can I really?  What's that f***ing f***ing show up at my house and show me how to make French toast?  How you doing, man who cooks for other men?  You want to whip me up something like a little dignity in a dish?  And a case of Gatorade?  And the bidding started at $10,000.  At $10,000.  And this is the little thing they gave you.  Wait, wait.  As the bidding was going on, the room went silent as they're trying to, you know, get an extra grand out of the prize or whatever. 
[02:27:30]  Because everyone was shocked that it started at $10,000.  It was virtually nothing.  That's what they were giving away.  They were giving away, like, swag that you would get anywhere.  And Jimmy couldn't help himself.  It was dead silent in the room.  There was easily a few hundred people there.  Maybe close to a thousand.  Who knows?  And all of a sudden you hear Jimmy loud as they go, clear as they go, can you throw in a Diet Coke?  A Diet Coke.  I bid $3. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, I bid $3.  At one point I bid a million dollars.  No, three million.  I bid $3 million.  He holds up his sign and goes, $3 million.  And people turn around, like, horrified looking at him.  That sucks.  He's so pissed off.  A case of Gatorade.  For what?  He's bidding $3 million on something.  $10,000 to work out with that f*** that cooks for you?  The guy on TV?  Why don't you drop dead?  Julia Child will come over and give you a happy ending. 
[02:28:30]  Drop dead.  Your dick basket sucked.  Oh, he's breaking his auction.  Hey, that's my bid.  Hey, that's my bid.  Yeah, good.  Let's see the gift basket.  Oh, here's the gift basket.  Let's see the bag of goodies you got at the end of the night.  This is what you got for your $20,000 table.  Wow, look at this.  Dr. Joan Fallon, the voice of the Yankee fans.  Boy.  Beating it with the bat that came with the...  Here you go.  Your gift basket...  Sucked. 
[02:29:00]  You can't rip ten pages at a time, so you had to make it into five pages.  Sorry, I'm not an athlete who blows off real fans.  You just broke your mic.  All right, let's see.  No one's listening to me anyway at this point.  All right, what else you got in the gift basket?  Here, Mr....  Oh, there we go.  That smile.  The life you imagine.  Wow, let's see.  I imagine blowing people off.  Uh, I imagine having no personality and a boyish smile. 
[02:29:30]  I imagine being a phony seasucker and blowing off a hardcore fan with a picture of me and him  so I can get some whore a screensaver shot.  Stop it!  I dropped the book.  You couldn't even slam the book.  You went to slam the book and it flew out behind him.  I dropped the book.  It's exactly how it should have happened.  He tried to make a statement by slamming the book into the floor.  Very dramatically.  As he lifted his arm up and he flew out behind me. 
[02:30:00]  And it flew behind him.  Because you're a nobody.  Maybe if Derek saw that, he would have signed it because he would have thought I was one of  those chick fans.  You are a retard at a t-ball game.  You really are.  Wait, there's pictures in the book, Jimmy.  Yeah, these are really touching pictures.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, there's nice family pictures.  But, uh, just, just, uh, what's it say?  I don't, you know, there, there, there, there he is.  There's all number two.  Now, Bucking, shut up! 
[02:30:30]  Go Sox, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, I actually do want to, oh, look at the charming.  There, there's the, there's the face of baseball.  Look at, isn't that, look at that, charming.  Yeah.  Ah!  All right, there he goes.  There he goes.  Oh!  Wow, look at, whoa!  Oh, no, no.  The Derek Jeter turn two foundation dinner.  Ah, it is high!  Minutes far!  You suck!  You just broke the trophy.  I broke the trophy.  But you could have put that on your trophy shelf. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, I could have, right?  But what, what, behind what?  Behind what?  It's a card.  Can you kick that over, Sam, with your stupid feet?  Hey, hey, Sam's a nice guy.  Leave Sam alone.  Yeah, I'm sure Sam would love Jeter.  They have something in common.  Uh, let's, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Here it is.  It's, it's the June 2006, 10th anniversary.  It's a little, the cheapest trophy I've ever seen in my life.  It's a piece of plastic around a baseball card, and there's a stand on it. 
[02:31:30]  And it's just, it's crap, like everything else.  And then, uh, yeah, what else was in the gift bag?  I don't know, CD.  I wonder what it is.  It's probably just a bunch of people going, Derek's so nice.  I met Derek once, it was really nice.  A bunch of girls going, he signed something for me because I'm a screensaver.  everything thank god the gift basket the gift basket soap they give you sporty soap so what  so you can clean your face as you're crying because one of your idols shot you down to sign  something so i can wipe off my back which feels more masculine than the way you treated me you

[02:35:30]  yeah you guys there yeah you got it let's go let's go guys i understand it's really good radio  and everything i understand uh you know everyone's listening everyone's getting a good laugh but  give me any idea what you're doing to yourself right now dude i'm just i feel better i have never  been more irritated in a situation like this than i was they have people at these events  called security for guys like you no they don't no absolutely absolutely not at that event i did 
[02:36:00]  not one inappropriate thing i didn't try to walk through security i wasn't in the way i stood by  the side and my irritation i saved for the next morning i didn't cause a problem there they don't  have events of security like me they have an event for security with guys who don't know when to back  off which i did i've had my own brush with the same type of of of uh event that you had i was 13  years old we had our football dinner at lt's restaurant if anybody's listening remembers 
[02:36:30]  in like rutherford new jersey right around there route 17 no cares where it is right right right  so all the giants show up everybody's like having a great time odessa turner steven baker i mean like  these are like little kids having their football dinner there everyone's got like nice speeches oh my god  get to the point point point of the story point of the story is lt shows up here we are spending  money in his place the guy shows up doesn't even lift his head for one picture signs like five 
[02:37:00]  autographs and blows off about half of our 13 year old football team i mean i had my own like  devastation because you know laurence taylor didn't look up during a freaking picture but jimmy  get over it dude you're how old you're successful in life what the hell's your problem if they're  what's my problem is dude that i've dealt with fans enough to know uh when someone is legitimately  just busy and being hustled off because they're running around and the guy's a superstar and when  they're being a scumbag i know the difference and i've never once had a fan present me yeah when 
[02:37:30]  you're in the public eye it's it's it's your responsibility to take care of it and it was  sometimes it's a pain in the ass sometimes you do want to go do other things sometimes you want to  leave an event right away but you got to understand how important your fans are and and and we do  and i'm at a charity not that we're on the same level as a dark jeter but uh i think that's what  jimmy's getting at we went to tower records two three weeks ago we were supposed to be there maybe  an hour and a half two hours we spent five hours there because we want to make sure everyone went  away with a a nice impression of us in the show and and uh and and have them walk away with a picture 
[02:38:00]  of us or an autograph and we even we had about 600 people there there's probably maybe 150 people  more jeter jeter had like 700 or 800 people there we had about 600 people at the tower thing i even said  we even hustled the line so nobody would be kept off yeah because tower records wanted to shut it  they wanted to shut it down so we're like all right let's at least hurry people through this so  everyone gets a chance at a quick moment say hi a genuine hello sometimes it's all you have time for  that's all i wanted out of labor it's hey man nice to see you go on you know it's surprising that he  just like it's not because they're all like that you know what has to be said too and i have no idea 
[02:38:30]  about jeter at all i want to state that but a lot of these things that these athletes and these  celebrities do they're doing it because they need a tax write-off and they don't really give a crap  about the actual cause and like i said i'd say that knowing nothing about derrick jeter and what  he's doing i'm whatever the charity that's why you'll have a million stories of these guys you  know doing something nice but they're blowing everyone off because they're just going through  the motions uh to get the tax write off until the guy who said how old are you i'm 37 it's common  knowledge i like to do this dude it's what i like about being in show business is that occasionally 
[02:39:00]  one of the things i like you get access to things like that that's what's fun for me you like to drink  you like to do what you do you okay that's what i like to do well that in prostitution those are the  things i like to do so what team are you gonna root for now that you're not i want to see the  red socks smash them because dude it wasn't just what about the tigers detroit's having a great year  care about any of that stuff it's just boston is the ones what about the pirates socks is the insult  yeah socks is is the i met a few of them they were nice every yankee i met except for giambi was not  nice even the ones that stopped were not nice and they didn't want to stop and i know they didn't want 
[02:39:30]  to stop all right let's go to matt and westchester matt what's up we got to wrap this up and move on to  some other things we got bob killian studio uh matt go ahead yeah hey how you doing hey uh you know  jimmy you remind me of that uh that that old lady in uh that scene in the king of comedy when uh jerry  lewis is walking down the street and uh and she stops him she's like hey hey i want an autograph  it's for my sister i can't i can't i can't no really please please please and he's like no i can't i  can't she walks away she screams you should get cancer i hope you get cancer well what she wanted dude 
[02:40:00]  and this happened to me last night she wanted jerry to talk to her nephew on the phone on the  phone i had a guy stop me when i walked in dude big fan love your stuff thanks man would you mind  signing something for my nephew so i signed it no problem um hey sure man happy to do it and then  would you mind talking to him and i'm like i can't so i was actually going i was actually at the  beast oh i think a lot of people went to that event last night by the way thinking they were  gonna hobnob with and it was so obvious that we were completely separated from from all the  quote celebrities that were there completely separate so you got to be realistic so wait 
[02:40:30]  wait wait so she asked you to talk and you and you said no he asked me to you know he had a phone  out it wasn't like he had the phone right here he was just gonna call and see if the guy was there  yeah no i'm not doing that i was i was actually i was trying to get to where jita was to get this  way early in the evening uh but i signed something i was polite to the guy he was like hey man thanks  for being a fan i appreciate it and that was it all right did he go away fine or was he pissed that  he said oh thanks for stopping man no he understood i wasn't being a dick i wasn't rude  well it's the only virus spreading across america we'll continue you're listening to

Excuse me, ma'am, but your bath mat is talking?  This is getting boring.  Why don't you hang up?  It couldn't be more boring than that lonely apartment.  Lonely empty bed.  All right.  Irene, we're out of time.  Look, I think that you degrade people like those two women who come there. 
[03:00:30]  Those two women who are non-pluralizing murderers?  Why do you deal with such a short form?  Because I think it's disgusting.  I don't like the short form.  Those two women.  I don't like you degrading people.  I don't like you degrading those two women.  Irene.  They're idiots, I know.  But why do you degrade them?  Irene, we've got to go.  We've got to go.  We have to go.  We've got to go.  We've got to go.  We're just hanging up on you, okay?  Aw, the ambulance worker sounded like he had some hope here at the end.  We're going to get through this, though. 
[03:01:00]  We've just got to keep your chin up.  Let's just stick with me.  First of all, we'll turn this thing around.  All right.  Oh, my stomach hurts.  Jesus Christ.  That was insane.  Don't you do it!  Don't you!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  Thank you.  Ah, I doubt not now.
