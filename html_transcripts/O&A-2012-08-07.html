<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the Olympics, focusing heavily on controversial refereeing in a US soccer victory over Canada, including a goalie holding the ball too long and a handball.  The hosts then moved on to commentary about female Olympic shot-putters, specifically one Belarusian athlete deemed exceptionally strong and masculine in appearance.  The conversation branched out to women's gymnastics, featuring commentary on Gabby Douglas and a Russian gymnast's emotional reaction to a mistake.  A British gymnast was compared to "Club Soda Kenny," prompting an online image search. The hosts continued with their commentary on various Olympic events including rowing (especially criticizing the “double skulls” event), and offered opinions on Usain Bolt’s performance.  A video clip of an American rower with a visible erection was shown and discussed extensively.  The possibility of MMA becoming an Olympic sport and the question of whether MLB players ever competed in the Olympics were also debated.  Attempts to connect with Bill Burr via phone failed due to technical issues.

A subsequent segment detailed Opie's unsuccessful attempts to connect with SiriusXM to get Bill Burr on the air, resulting in humorous exchanges and Opie ultimately hanging up on the receptionist.  Bill Burr then called in from South Bend Airport, describing the airport and his recent attendance at a funeral before heading to a gig at Foxwoods.  The conversation turned to Burr’s upcoming performances, including a private party, prompting speculation about the potential attendees.  The discussion returned to the Olympics, with humorous observations about various events and athletes including the British national anthem, the perceived athletic differences between Black and White athletes in track and field, gymnastics, and the perceived arbitrariness of some Olympic sports like trampoline and field hockey.  Holly Mangold, a female powerlifter, was discussed, along with YouTube videos of powerlifting accidents. Further attempts to contact the previously unhelpful SiriusXM employee were made, with more comedic confusion and frustration resulting from incorrect phone numbers and accidental calls to the Summer Games Radio show.  The segment concluded with discussion of Rob's upcoming pool party and regional slang differences (crayon vs. crown, taffy vs. lollipop), with Russell Peters mentioned as a future guest.

The next segment focused extensively on Rob's pool party, with the hosts and Jim Norton looking at and making sexually explicit and offensive comments about photos of potential female attendees.  Vulgar jokes, racist and misogynistic language, and crude humor dominated this part of the show. The conversation then shifted to Bill Burr's recent travel troubles, involving a plane experiencing a gas leak and an emergency evacuation, with a picture of a firetruck at the scene shared. Russell Peters then joined the show in studio.  The discussion covered Peters' upcoming gigs and his international appeal.  A conversation about Peters' and Jim Norton's shared preference for women's perfumes followed.  They briefly discussed the Olympics, specifically the difficulty in finding boxing coverage.  Peters detailed his boxing training, including sparring sessions that annoyed a nearby yoga studio. The segment concluded with further discussion of Rob's pool party and promotion of Chip's YouTube videos.

A subsequent segment compared the sizes of boxers across different weight classes, focusing on the differences between Ali and Foreman's eras. This led to a discussion of a Mike Douglas Show interview featuring Ali, a reportedly drunk Sly Stone, and Howard Cosell, focusing on Ali's reaction to Stone and his contrasting television personas.  The hosts speculated on Cosell's potential racism and his dynamic with Ali.  A caller experienced technical difficulties, and the conversation returned to Cosell's age and appearance in the footage, before delving into Cosell's career and death, including his appearances on *The Odd Couple*.  The relationship between Ali and Cosell was extensively discussed, described as adversarial yet respectful and compared to that of Larry Merchant and contemporary boxers.  The hosts then discussed the death of boxer Vernon Forrest, a friend of one of the hosts.  This transitioned into a lengthy discussion with a guest, Russell, about his recent divorce after 14 months of marriage, partly due to a quick pregnancy and marriage.  Russell discussed his divorce, his relationship with his ex-wife, and the challenges of being a comedian in a relationship.  The segment then featured a highly explicit discussion of sexual preferences, fetishes, and personal experiences, focusing on a foot fetish, including detailed descriptions of preferred characteristics, specific celebrity feet, and graphic descriptions of sexual acts.  Discussions of racial preferences in partners and specific pornographic websites and their content were also included.

The final segment featured Russell Peters again.  The conversation started with anecdotes about Peters' relationships with the hosts and other individuals, including Yoshi, described as a "psychopath" but "well-meaning."  A comparison of talk show formats followed, with praise for Graham Norton's show. Peters discussed his upcoming stand-up gigs, including a show at the Barclays Center, sharing the venue with major acts like Jay-Z, Justin Bieber, and Barbra Streisand. He also mentioned past and future performances. The hosts promoted their own events, including a contest with a $1000 prize for female contestants.  The segment concluded with a brief outro mentioning "Head After Opie and Anthony Live."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the program.  So I guess we got a tainted victory. Taint? Everyone's talking about the tainted victory. Taint? US over Canada, soccer. Ah, soccer. Yeah, what happened? I guess Canada is a little upset with us. 
[00:00:30]  Canada is very upset. Those goddamn Canadians. There's nothing they can do about it. We're playing for the gold. Yeah, yeah. They're pissed off up there today. Why is it taken? Well, a couple of funny calls, I think. 
[00:01:00]  Well, the Canadian goalie held the ball for more than six seconds, something they usually don't call, but they decided to call it. So that gave, what, the Americans a free shot there? Yeah.  A free shot basically is when all the players, like, line up in front of the goal and you just kick the shit out of the ball and hope someone flinches. Right. Right? Yeah.  I don't care how good you are at soccer, you're still thinking, I'm going to be the one that flinches. Fuck that. So then during that, the ball hit one of the Canada's players' arms. 
[00:01:30]  Yep. But she was trying to get out of the way, it looked like, but it hit her arm, so that means a penalty kick. Hands! Hands! And then the ref said, hands!  And then they, now they get a penalty kick, which is a lot different. Right. That's just the guy. One-on-one.  Or the chick kicking into the goal with just the goalie. I think you might be right about the guy thing. Yeah. Yeah. I know.  There were some beasts playing in that game. No, those were fucking gorgeous women compared to what I saw last night. 
[00:02:00]  The woman's shot-putting effect. Holy motherfuck. Dude, I don't even know what that was. There's some woman from, oh, which one is she? I was tweeting it last night.  I fucking didn't watch the Olympics. I'm so bummed. Dude, she's, it's not even a man. I don't know what it is.  Could she beat you up? Yes! I hate knowing women can beat me up. A beast!  How many women do you think can beat you up? Bulgaria, was it? Or one of those fucking crazy-ass countries. 
[00:02:30]  I don't know. I've seen a few in the Olympics. I could just rock your ass.  Doesn't that bum you out as a man? Why?  How many men out there know that there's not one woman? That's her, on the left.  There's not one woman alive that can beat them up. How many women, how many guys do you think are in that category?  A bunch of the MMA fighters, if not all of them. Sure.  And maybe a few football players. Belarus. Really? Huh?  Just a few of us. Oh, Jesus, Chip. Not really. No, it's too early.  She's from Belarus. It really is. Please. Belarus. 
[00:03:00]  Belarus? Belarus. That's a guy.  Did she win the gold?  I don't know. I just heard her fucking, blah!  As she throws this big hunk of steel further than they even put the measuring marks.  What a mullet. She's a mullet. It was crazy.  I like the other woman who's trying with the hoop earrings.  Yeah, she's trying. Nice try, broad.  And then the third one...  She looks like a big Samoan.  But the third one looks all right. Did she win a medal?  I saw her and...  The Russian? That's a good picture of her. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, really?  I'll just tell you that much.  That's a glamour shot?  They get glamour shots?  That is a glamour shot of this.  Oh, we didn't finish our soccer thing.  Right, right.  So then the penalty kick, the USA there makes the penalty kick, and then that makes the game  basically go to OT, and then we went in OT, and now Canada's really fucking pissed off.  Yeah, now they're all pissy about the whole thing.  And I don't blame them. I hate tainted victories. It just feels dirty.  Well, when it's, you know, something that happens, if it was against the U.S., people would be bitching. 
[00:04:00]  Well, there's a conspiracy theory, though, too, because everyone wants to see the U.S. play Japan,  and that's what's happening now.  No, they're playing China.  I mean...  Japan.  Japan.  What? I thought they played China.  No, man. They're playing the country with the good hairstyles.  Fucking MSNBC screwed up, then. I get it. That's the only way you can tell.  That's the only way you can tell. They do stuff with their hair.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Yes, I want a brand-new American hairstyle.  Girl, no, like when look straight and back.  So I want a business in the front, party in the back, like Billy Ray Cyrus.  There you go. Yeah, we're playing that.  We're going to see some nice hairstyles.  Well, they screwed up, then, on MSNBC. Go figure.  And I believe that's what everybody wants to see. 
[00:05:00]  So sorry, Canada.  You were used to make sure everyone gets the game they want to see.  Wow, that's her?  Getting back to shot pudding?  That's Nadzia Ostapuk.  Where's she from?  Belarus.  Wow.  E-Rock, you got relatives in Belarus?  Oh, my God, yes.  That's a woman?  That's a woman.  That's a woman.  And that picture is flattering. 
[00:05:30]  Because you should see, what I saw last night when they showed video of her actually throwing the shot put,  because they baked that face.  Holy fuck, I didn't know what it was.  She looks like Corey Feldman.  She's an awful woman.  Horrid, like fucking the hair and everything.  That is rough, man.  Uh, girl no like straight black hair.  Want American girlfriend.  Just no like just good on pommel horse. 
[00:06:00]  So let's get the new hairstyle, like your famous American lesbian, Melissa Atrey.  Shit, look at her hair.  It's all fucking dykey.  It's horrible.  I love how the Japanese voice becomes like calm and musical.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, shot putting, huh?  Yeah, shot put.  Man, they get some bruiser women for the show.  Oh, God, look at her.  Are they throwing it over 10 feet yet? 
[00:06:30]  I remember back in the day, it was pretty much 10 feet.  Damn, they're throwing like 60 fucking feet.  Really?  I don't know how.  She was throwing it further than the measure lines.  Wow.  She, whatever the fuck.  So she's way better than everyone else?  She was pretty good.  I don't know if she won.  That's a guy.  You would say that's a guy.  You would.  Look at this picture.  I know.  The muscles, the hair.  You would swear that's a guy.  That's crazy looking.  How many times has she been called Madam Sir?  Madam Sir?  Excuse me, Madam Sir.  Looks like that thing that used to fucking have the potato salad in the wig over at the 
[00:07:00]  Mark of Meridian.  I missed that guy.  I'm sure he's still there, right?  Yeah, we should go over and say hi.  He gets so excited to see us.  He really does.  Just itches wig for him.  He has the worst wig ever.  And he don't give a fuck.  No.  Very cool.  So shot putting.  And what else did they have last night?  Well, they had some more.  What is this event?  Gymnastics.  Hold on, hold on.  Look, what's live right now?  It's not good enough that there's rolling events. 
[00:07:30]  Now there's a rolling event where you have to be on one knee.  They're like on a knee and then they're taking a knee.  Right.  And then they're rowing like that.  That's an odd thing.  What is that called?  They're actually not kneeling.  Their feet actually went through the boat.  Through the bottom of the boat.  They're using it for propulsion.  Why do they have to have so many varieties of one sport?  Of rowing.  I don't get it.  Yeah, there's a fixed oar.  Why do they insist that has to be an Olympic sport?  Was that Angola?  This is men's lightweight double skulls. 
[00:08:00]  What?  Double skulls.  And the MMA is not in the Olympics, really?  No.  But this is?  Will you stop already?  I'm not going as fast as the other.  Double skulls.  Double skulls.  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why is that a rowing style?  I don't know.  Why?  Why?  Why is that?  How far back is the other team?  The Angola team, not very good.  They're just afraid of falling in.  Yeah.  That's like anybody else rowing through fire. 
[00:08:30]  Wow, they stink.  Yeah, this is real.  You know, the rowing is pretty boring anyway, but...  This is a horrible sport.  Look at China going for it.  Cuba, China, Brazil, the Czech Republic.  Where's Angola?  Let's see.  Wow, they're not even on camera.  They're not even there.  No, they should be good at that, I'm thinking.  They're trying to pirate the other fucking little boats.  They had women's gymnastics last night, which of course is a favorite of mine.  No, they have more individual events. 
[00:09:00]  And old Gabby, old Gabby was out there competing on the uneven bars, but she had a mistake.  And what happened?  She had a little mistake.  She didn't get a big score.  That little Aaliyah, a Russian chick.  The Russian chick Aaliyah, who looks like...  I decided she looks kind of like a Bond villainess.  She's got a Russian look.  She wears a lot of eye makeup.  She's got a snotty kind of seductress look.  Is she the one that looks like she's going to cry?  No, that's Victoria with a K. 
[00:09:30]  Victoria.  She was crying again because her little foot hit the bar, hit the lower bar when she was  swinging really big on the upper bar, and she got prints taken off.  Don't go to her mug shot.  Jesus, she ain't wearing all that nice eye makeup that she wears.  Well, that's the official...  Aaliyah Mustafani.  Aaliyah Mustafani.  That's the official Olympic photo.  Well, it's not good. 
[00:10:00]  Do you know, I love...  By the way, we're watching the rowing.  I love these people in the stands.  So they sit there all day to watch exactly six seconds of rowing.  Of them passing them by.  What's happening?  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.  Yay!  Woo!  Rest of the day.  Nothing, nothing, nothing.  Water, a bird, nothing.  A man walking.  Jimmy, you're onto something.  You've never gone to a golf event, obviously.  Never.  I've walked the course a bunch of times over the years.  And there are people that will camp out.  I've said this on the air, but it goes with your bit. 
[00:10:30]  They will camp out for three hours on the golf course to watch Tiger Woods hit one ball.  That's it.  When you watch it on TV, you just assume maybe all these people are just kind of following the players around.  No, you can't follow anyone around.  That's how many people go to these events.  So you have to camp out and you see Tiger.  What's the hardest hole to get, the first or the 18th?  It all depends on the course, to be honest with you.  I mean, the 18th.  The 18th is a good one.  But people will get real good seats on the 18th hole and have to wait all day to get the better players. 
[00:11:00]  But they love it at the end.  Oh, look, here comes the birdie punt.  Fucking yuck.  You don't like that, Jimmy?  No, I just love it.  Who is it that blows it every time?  I hate him.  Well, Phil Mickelson might blow a putt every once in a while.  We got the PGA this weekend?  I don't know.  PGA Championship time, I think?  No, it can't be this weekend.  It wouldn't compete with the Olympics, would it? 
[00:11:30]  No, nothing's competing with the Olympics.  Yeah, of course not.  Oh, no.  Huge.  Oh, so gymnastics, Hank.  Yeah, so I was watching that, the little Russian, not the little, little Russian, the medium Russian, she won the gold in the uneven bars.  It was pretty fucking flawless.  It is this weekend.  Got to give it to her.  Oh, it is?  Oh, the PGA?  Wow.  The last major of the year.  Yeah, and then the little pixie one just started crying because she hit her foot on the bar.  It was pretty good.  I like watching her cry.  It's hilarious. 
[00:12:00]  She just gets so upset.  Yeah, but this Moustafina, yeah, she wears a lot of that big eye makeup and everything.  She's cute.  She looks like one of those Russian strippers you see in every club.  She's got big eyes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Go to the metal thing again because I think I saw something.  Oh, yeah, there's China again.  No hairstyle.  No, no.  They just, I.  They look very good so the American girl will like me. 
[00:12:30]  So I tell Baba, give me hair.  Don't bleach.  Bleach my hair.  Make puffy.  Like American rock star, Adi Snyder.  Of course, that's Japan again.  China, not so much.  Not so much.  China just doesn't give a fuck about their hair.  They really, there's a, is that little Victoria?  I feel bad for her.  She looks like a progeria kid when she's out there. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, yeah, she looks awful.  And she, she's very good.  I mean, she's, you know, she was doing a great job and then she hit her foot on the fucking bar.  I don't know how you do that.  Um, Gabby.  We're learning more about Gabby.  Yeah, Gabby, she missed a move.  She was spinning around there on the fucking uneven bar.  She gets on top, she's supposed to do one of them turns and, or, or fly off the bar  and catch the other one.  And she just kind of stayed there in a little handstand, decided, I'm not going to do that 
[00:13:30]  move.  Really?  And the judges, no.  They said, fuck that.  The judges are like, we know there's supposed to be a move there.  Did they penalize her?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, really?  Penalized her and she fucking lost.  And you know what that's about?  Hmm.  Racism?  She now knows, no.  She's distracted because she now knows, the whole world knows that she doesn't have a father.  Her mom is broke, ass broke.  Her mom is broke.  Mm-hmm.  And the father is kind of one of those fathers that doesn't give a fuck.  Just took off.  Just kind of took off.  Oh, he'll come back now.  But now the whole world knows, so I think she got distracted. 
[00:14:00]  He's going to come back like that macaroni and cheese announcer guy.  I got you, remember he went to his daughter?  Ted Williams.  I got you a Louis Vuitton.  Right.  And she's like, it's not about the Louis Vuitton, Dad.  It's one of the greatest clips ever.  I got you a Louis Vuitton.  A clueless asshole that, you know, blew off his family for, I love you, I love you, I don't know.  That idiot.  Yeah.  That we all loved for two days.  Everybody loved him.  And then realized, yeah, he should be homeless because he's a piece of shit. 
[00:14:30]  Crap, macaroni and cheese.  Right.  I still hear that fucking commercial.  Can we break that down?  Because it's hilarious.  It was what?  Stupid Dr. Phil?  That's Dr. Phil, right?  And he blows off his family forever.  And then he thinks a dumb Louis Vuitton is going to make everything better.  And he said it like, I got you a Louis Vuitton.  Like, she's going to go, ah!  Ah!  That makes up for your horrid parenting.  Right.  Thank you, Daddy.  That's great.  Yeah.  So, um...  You think Gabby's father is like, ah, shit.  Gabby's dad's going to come back. 
[00:15:00]  Hey.  Hey, Gabby.  What's up?  Where you been?  Where'd you go?  Idaho or some shit?  I'm back.  Back in your life.  Your daddy's back, Gabby.  What'd you do, anyway?  I saw you on the TV.  You robbed somebody or some shit?  Let me see that gold medal.  Let me see that gold.  Let me see that gold medal.  I could take this downtown.  Get me some fucking money for this motherfucker. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, and the mother's broke.  She's, uh...  She's just geared up to be...  Officially bankrupt, right?  ...a workhorse for the family.  The entire family.  Yeah.  I can't get enough of the other sisters.  Gabby, I got you a knockoff Louis Vuitton.  The golden voice.  Go back to Iowa.  Leave them all behind.  Yeah.  Just run for your life, Gabby.  Go back to that white family of yours.  I listened to her talking last night after the uneven bar thing, and she's like, 
[00:16:00]  Well, I tried my hardest, and I just want to congratulate everybody that...  Oh, two months with her parents.  Yeah, I won the motherfucker.  You think she's going back home with Mommy?  Leave me alone, Mama.  I'm an Olympic gold medal winner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Gabby seems like a nice little girl.  Of course she is.  That's why we're so worried.  Oh, she seems so sweet and nice, and...  Oh, it's every white person's dream of a black person. 
[00:16:30]  She is.  We know how this is going to end.  Yes.  You just know how this is going to end.  Oh, that gold medal gives me that.  Gives me that.  What else about the Olympics yesterday?  Anything good?  How about the pole vault thing?  You checked that shit out.  I was checking out some pole vaulting.  I saw, um...  That's a pretty fucked up sport, huh?  It's so literally hit or miss.  It doesn't...  You can't tell, no matter how good they are, if they're going to make it over that bar. 
[00:17:00]  And sometimes you're just like, nah, she blew it.  Holy fuck, she made it.  It's pretty cool to watch.  The German girl was very Aryan looking.  Very...  Yeah.  I tweeted it last night.  They're stout.  From good stock?  From very good stock, the German girls.  Although the German gymnast was a little fucking thick.  She was a little thick.  You could tell when she was going around the uneven bars, that bar was bending a little  more than when those little pixies are up there.  Put a little strain on that bar. 
[00:17:30]  Did that old broad perform again last night?  No.  Well, oh, a 27-year-old gymnast was up there.  That's young compared to the 37-year-old we had the other day.  From Great Britain?  Yeah.  She's the spitting image of Club Soda Kenny.  I was cracking up!  And she's a gymnast?  And somebody actually put the pictures together.  Yes.  Come on.  Someone put the pictures together last night.  And it was just fucking hilarious.  For what sport?  She's from Great Britain. 
[00:18:00]  And she is a...  Not a pole vaulter.  She's a gymnast.  She's an old gymnast.  27 is very old for that sport.  27.  Just a hag at that point.  You see a lot of stuff jiggling when they run toward the vault.  Yeah, yeah.  The pommel horse.  She was smiling and it just looked like fucking...  She looked like Club Soda Kenny.  Wait, who won the gold there?  In the gymnastics?  For the men's there.  That guy.  Oh.  Yang takes vault gold. 
[00:18:30]  Where's Yang from?  From the picture, I have to say Japan.  Let's see.  Where's Yang from?  No.  Where's he from?  No, Korea?  God damn it.  Yeah, but they...  Not as much as Japan.  Not as much.  Not great as much.  I go to your American barber.  Say, I want an exciting American haircut.  So he tell me to look like Julius Caesar. 
[00:19:00]  So I tell him, give me a George Clooney.  American movie star George.  I think these haircutting shops just have pictures of someone.  Oh, they gotta.  You want to make it easy for everyone.  You want that one.  Like the way they cut hair.  American women love my new groovy hairstyle.  I can see the club soda Kenny brought. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, where is she?  Anyone remember the name of...  All we need is the name.  And then we can Google image that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Help us out.  Help us.  Help us.  Help us.  Yeah, I tweeted and someone tweeted a side-by-side picture.  They tweeted it to you?  Well, you're never going to say it, no.  I can find it.  Nah, it's just too much.  Watch me find it.  Way too many mentions.  No, no one knows her name.  No one knows her name, huh?  27.  I think if you put 27-year-old, or 27 gymnasts... 
[00:20:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Club soda Kenny.  Get the whole conversation?  Maybe?  No.  Uh, uh, no, no.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, she...  What a set of choppers on her.  And, um...  Yeah, a lot of gum.  And she was...  The only gymnastics thing last night that I could find for women  was, uh...  Was the uneven bars.  So you sure she's a gymnast?  It was uneven bars. 
[00:20:30]  It was uneven bars.  Those are gymnasts.  Yeah, I know.  That do that.  I didn't see anybody that looked like Kenny.  Great Britain?  Let's see.  She's got a...  Get her name and then...  And then...  Her?  Oh, that's her.  Oh, all right.  Come on.  Look at her.  Hang on.  Get another.  Elizabeth Tweedle.  It's Elizabeth Tweedle.  If Kenny grew his hair.  Get some smiling pictures of her.  Hey, fucking Kenny.  Wait a minute.  Go down bottom right.  All the way bottom right. 
[00:21:00]  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Look at this one.  Hi.  Oh, jeez.  God, she's horrid.  The first one is the best.  Go up again.  All the way to the left.  That's like...  Hi.  Oh, my God.  I was like, look at that.  It's like Kenny.  Oh, my God.  You never want to...  As a woman, you never want to look like Club Soda Kenny.  No.  No, you don't.  That's insulting to a man, to a woman, that's a fucking death sentence. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, that's hilarious, man.  I like that bottom right one right there.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I wish that would come up, but it doesn't.  Yeah.  I guess.  Maybe it's down lower.  You have to right-click on capture.  Yeah, what's the matter with that?  That's a good find.  No, no, no.  On the actual picture, right there.  That is a good find.  Right-click on it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I see what's going on.  I hate having to do all parts of the show.  I just do the computer as I do.  You really are.  You do everything on there.  You got it?  That should be saved as. 
[00:22:00]  There it is.  Wow.  Zoom in.  Zoom in.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's Kenny.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Hi.  Can I make you uncomfortable?  That was great.  That's really funny.  That's going to make me laugh all day.  She really looks like fucking Kenny.  That's terrible for a woman.  And she was a little too big, so her dismount, like, those little pixies have such a low center 
[00:22:30]  of gravity that when they spin off the bar and do their dismount, they could just stick  it.  And these bigger girls that are trying to do this past their prime, the momentum of  them spinning just carries them over.  They can never stick a landing.  They're too fucking lanky.  And you think they're real tall, and they walk over to their trainers, and they're even  midgets.  And then you realize how midgety the fucking good ones are.  The whole thing is.  Yeah.  The whole thing is midgety.  They're all midgety.  The coaches, the gymnasts, the judges, the announcers. 
[00:23:00]  They're all midgety.  They're all midgety.  And boy, it don't matter what sport is on, one of the announcers has to be a gay guy.  What is that about?  It's just amazing.  What is that about?  Well, we're here in the double rowing competition.  Rowing?  Rowing?  What does that have to do with anything?  I don't know.  Why the gay guy?  They're always gay.  Mr. Erock.  Since you watched the women's gymnastics.  I certainly did.  The announcer that you're talking about for that sport. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Seems to hate every girl that does a routine.  Of course.  He pointed out, she did it wrong.  Ugh.  The whole time.  He's very catty.  Well, I think it's smart, because he's not distracted by how hot some of these women are.  Maybe that's what it is.  You don't want to look at that ass.  Maybe in a weird way, it's smart.  Go, you know, tight ass and stuff.  But then you've got the men doing, like, the rings.  Ha!  He's fucking breathing like Philip Seymour Hoffman in Boogie Nights.  He's holding the boom mic, and he's just shaking, like... 
[00:24:00]  With that fucking medium shirt on his big stomach.  She's alright.  She's alright.  She's the best.  What a genius shirt that was.  Yeah, it was great.  It's awful hairdo.  Fucking Liam.  Someone say, look up swimmer versus gymnast.  Missy Franklin next to Shawn Johnson.  Oh.  Shawn Johnson, I think, is pretty brutal looking, too, right?  Is she?  What?  But I think Great Britain just loves this blonde.  Isn't she the blonde from...  Yeah, she has that massive nose, I think. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, Missy Franklin's alright.  She's alright, right?  Missy Franklin's kinda...  Gotta get rid of those huge shoulders, but...  She's a little plain-ish.  She's, uh, you know...  Uh...  S-H-A-W-N.  See if that's different.  I don't know.  What?  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Whoa.  She's not bad.  No, that's...  Wow.  She's in that...  She's in a commercial, right? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, man.  She's in a commercial.  She's doing a handstand.  She spills some chocolate milk or some shit.  Yeah, something like that.  I've seen that one.  She's beautiful.  What happened?  Why wasn't she in the Olympics?  Did they do diving again?  She messed up her leg.  Did she?  She went skiing.  Oh, right, right.  Okay.  Now I remember the story.  Steary.  The steary.  Did they do diving again?  I think diving might be done, right?  I heard there was diving because my Twitter kinda had some activity of guys going, thanks 
[00:25:30]  a lot, dick.  I'm looking at big, huge bulges now.  Yes, a lot of big cocks in the diving.  In their tiny little swim bottoms.  They were diving again?  Preliminaries.  Preliminaries.  What the fuck?  Relim diving.  Preliminaries a lot.  No one gives a fuck about preliminaries.  How long are you diving for?  Boy, these Olympics are crazy.  They don't need to show preliminaries.  Some of these sports, like you see them on now and you're like, oh, this is old.  Get to like new sports. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, exactly.  When does Bolt run again?  Today?  Is he doing the 200 meter today?  He's got the world record in that event, too.  Yeah, huh?  He should win gold again.  He's a fast motherfucker.  Yeah, he is.  Sam's got something for the show.  Sam, what happened?  Did you see the rowing picture?  Which one?  It's really fun.  Oh, with the rowing team guys?  Yeah.  Is that real or did somebody Photoshop that? 
[00:26:30]  Who cares?  I think all you've got to do is take out a dick.  Get out of here.  You take out a dick and you just like screen it over the fucking thing.  Why is that going on?  You have some shadowing.  Oh, shit.  It's a video.  Wait, it's a video?  Oh, my God.  That guy's got a fucking boner.  That guy's dick is like...  Is it because he won the gold?  Yeah, he's exciting.  No, bronze.  This is...  You don't...  You don't get a hard-on from winning a bronze?  You don't get a hard-on or is his dick just...  Because I'll push my dick like that a lot of times where it's not hard, where you...  I like it resting up against me instead of down. 
[00:27:00]  Well, then he's got one of those showers.  Everyone knows a dick's got to face up when you're walking around.  Jay Moore brought that whole grower versus shower.  That guy's going to the side.  He's pointing like, hey, look, I'm with stupid.  That thing is...  God, he presented it up and to the side like that?  His cock is up and to the right.  Oh, it's the United States, too.  Oh, good boy.  Oh, that's hilarious.  This guy's just there with his big dick.  Can we put that on the Facebook page there, Iraq?  I hope his family isn't looking at that.  Even his mother's probably going, his cock is showing. 
[00:27:30]  My boy's cock.  It really...  They're zooming in.  They're zooming right in on it.  That doesn't look...  That looks like a...  Home video camera, yeah.  What do they call that?  Pan and scan?  Pan and scan.  You can't, like, have your cock...  You can see the helmet.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And his balls and everything.  I want those shorts.  I want to wear those everywhere.  You want what's in them?  No, I don't.  I don't want his penis and balls and semen and asshole.  This guy's on the metal stand and some asshole on the stands is just focusing in, zooming in on his dick. 
[00:28:00]  How fucking funny is that?  And he's holding the flowers.  Oh, they all are holding.  He's kind of embarrassing.  I wonder if he knows.  He's got to know.  He might have done it on purpose.  You always know what your dick's up to.  You might have just fluffed on purpose to look like that.  It's like, that's hilarious.  You just go out.  He goes, I'm going out with a fucking rod through these shorts.  It's better than a little dick.  That's what I'm saying.  Then you're looking like, eh, you got a little dick.  I guess if you got, you know, a big one and you're on the metal stand, who gives a fuck?  He might have tried to fluff it a little to look good and then went too far and like, 
[00:28:30]  oh, fuck.  Now I got the rod.  Oh, now it's got a point straight up.  It goes from embarrassing, embarrassing.  All right.  Looks good.  Wow.  You look great.  You look like you got a big dick on you.  And then, ah, it's embarrassing again because now you got a rod.  And he gets to the point.  I need pussy.  Right.  Too messin'.  Yeah, it's too messin'.  I would look at that and think, am I going to grow up and have one like that that bulges  in such a delicious fashion? 
[00:29:00]  It's like a giant candy treat.  I thought that might have been a shop job, but, ah, no, that's real.  It's obvious.  It's real.  That is real, actually.  You can see all their clocks.  That guy, she's got the biggest one.  Yeah, huh?  Man, oh, man.  I'm not asking.  What's that?  He's got a new character.  Sometimes they just come in, they're one and done.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, Dana White says MMA should be an Olympic sport. 
[00:29:30]  Of course.  He's right.  Of course.  It should be.  I think people have such a huge misconception of MMA.  They think it's the old-style fighting, you know, free-for-all kind of just nailing people  bloody, no classes, no weight classes or anything in the old days.  You know, you get some fucking little jujitsu guy in there against Butterbean, and they both  just try to bloody each other's face.  But you've got to think the people in the know know this is a hugely successful sport.  Yeah, but even the people in the know know that most people don't know that. 
[00:30:00]  I think most people still don't know.  Yes.  I absolutely think most people.  We can't be unbiased here, because we know the sport too well.  And we know all the guys.  Yeah.  But I think most of the people think that it's still just fucking ground and pound someone  in the face, and it doesn't stop until someone's bleeding to death.  We just watched guys rowing, standing up.  Yeah, that's a lame one.  And they don't know about MMA?  Come on. 
[00:30:30]  How do they know about the standing up rowing event?  Oh, they don't.  We didn't.  Where did that come from?  I don't know.  But someone had to sit down and go, you know what?  We're going to do the standing up rowing event in the Olympics.  Yeah.  I don't know.  How do they decide new sports?  I think it takes forever too, right?  Does it?  They can't just say, we're going to have it at the next Olympics.  Yeah, yeah.  It's got to go in front of a board, I'm sure.  And then don't they have it sometimes as a sport, but they don't give out medals just  to try it out?  Just see how it works.  And see how it's going to work or something?  Maybe. 
[00:31:00]  There's a whole process, I believe.  So the MMA is not going to be in the Olympics anytime soon is my point.  And how do they agree to that two-man luge?  Wow.  That's weird too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is the strangest event.  And people train their whole lives for that.  Boner guy would do well on that one.  Looking boner guy.  He'd hold on to that fucking partner.  The grip.  The anal grip.  Is the headline really American rowers third place in rowing? 
[00:31:30]  Going first in boners?  It's gawkers.  Good old gawker.  It's not the Huffington Post headline.  And the MMA is done all over the world too, so that would be easy.  Some of these sports, you know, they focus on one country mostly.  Yeah.  Those sports they have a problem with, I think.  Yeah, a lot of countries do that.  I mean...  Some asshole had to tweet me.  The reason they don't have baseball in the Olympics is because all the good players  are in the major leagues right now.  Well, how about you just allow the amateurs? 
[00:32:00]  Fuck it.  Whoever wants to go.  They did shut down baseball one Olympics, right?  Did they do it one year?  I don't remember.  I think they shut it down for a couple weeks.  Japan would probably win, though, because their season isn't now, is it?  I don't know when their baseball season is, but they're really good because, you know,  they're good at baseball.  Cuba would probably do...  Cuba would play.  They would probably do very well.  Cuba would do very well.  Dominican Republic would do very well.  They have some great players.  How about this?  The last time they had baseball in the Olympics, who won the gold?  Does anyone even know?  Was it our boys? 
[00:32:30]  No.  No, we didn't send pros, right?  I think one time we did send pros.  Yeah.  I vaguely remember we shut down the baseball season for a couple weeks.  Right?  Someone's got to know.  Well, because there's no baseball field.  What do you got, Sam?  Cuba.  Cuba.  Cuba won it 92.  Who'd they beat?  92?  That was the last time we had baseball?  There's no way. 
[00:33:00]  Yes.  Yes, way.  No way.  With El Duque playing.  We got to remember, it's every four years, so...  But the last time...  No, no.  What?  There's no way, Ant.  I'm telling you right now.  No?  There's no way.  No.  We sent our major league guys...  Did we?  Since 92.  2008.  Yeah, this says 2008.  Yeah, I think it was the last Olympics.  Okay.  And what was our team?  Who was our team?  We only won in 2000, though.  Cuba won in 92, 96, 2004. 
[00:33:30]  And in 2008, South Korea had the gold.  What?  Yes.  Wow.  And so, we sent our major league players, and we did win the gold.  Who do we send?  Is there a team?  What if you click on...  No?  No.  I bet that.  Which year?  Do you want to know?  Uh, the last time...  Wow!  2008.  Let's go with 2008.  Make it easy.  The last Olympics.  Because this Olympics, they don't have baseball.  I bet they didn't want them fucking themselves up during the season. 
[00:34:00]  Well, then why do they send the NBA guys?  Because they don't give a shit about them.  I don't know.  They sent these people.  These people.  Who's that?  Brett Anderson, Blaine Neal, Matt Brown, Nate Sheerholtz, Jeremy Cummings, Michael Koplov.  I, I, I've, I've heard enough names to say that we sent our all-stars.  We sent our amateurs.  This doesn't sound like the all-star roster. 
[00:34:30]  I don't know.  When was the last time we sent our major league players?  I don't know if we ever did.  I think we did.  We won in 2000.  I just don't remember, um...  Oh, I'm thinking of the World Baseball Classic?  We've never sent our boys to the Olympics?  Yeah, I don't think we have.  Stop.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, these don't...  I have some wild dreams.  Yeah, Mike Kincaid, Shane Hearns, and then Marcus Jensen.  Of course, those are all-stars.  Yeah.  Chris George.  Yeah, well, Chris George, obviously, I have his rookie card.  You think he'd get a lot of money for his rookie card? 
[00:35:00]  I would if I could trade it for a, uh, a Brent Abernathy.  A Brent Abernathy card!  Look at it, the pack's full of them.  The pack is full of them.  Brent Abernathy rookie card.  B. Dailing, who is this slouch?  Never heard of him.  It's the United States 2000 Olympic Baseball Team rookie cards. 
[00:35:30]  And they're only rookie cards because they never went on to do anything else.  Isn't that weird?  They played in the Olympics, but we don't know their names.  Yeah.  Don't know anything about them.  Look back on either...  I like looking back on major accomplishments of people at one point, like ten years ago.  Yeah.  Whether it's a movie role, or you look at someone who co-starred with De Niro or Brad Pitt in a movie.  Thought it was going to be huge.  And you're like, what the fuck happened to that person?  We were talking about that Saturday with Platoon.  Right, right.  They were rolling the credits for Platoon, and Jim's like, what happened to that guy? 
[00:36:00]  He's in fucking Platoon with Charlie Sheen.  You would assume that would have got him some more roles.  Yeah, nothing.  Where's Merv Shrewsbury?  What happened to him?  He played Lieutenant Ferbs.  Or whatever.  Some terrible name.  He had nothing.  Oh, so here's Dana White talking about the MMA.  Oh.  Well, anyways, man, too bad the Americans didn't do so well in boxing, man.  Yeah, I heard.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You think UFC will ever be an Olympic?  It should be.  I mean, if you think about it right now, boxing, you can punch to the head and body. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Shudo, you can do throws, and you can do submissions.  Taekwondo, you can kick and punch.  And wrestling, you can take down and do throws.  All those things are all, with the UFC, it is mixed martial arts.  So, it should be putting them all together.  It should be.  Maybe one day we'll have a sport.  It's not my job.  I'm not heading out.  That's true.  That's true.  Yeah, that's going to be a long road.  It really will be a long road, unfortunately.  Well, it's such...  You know what, though?  That would be so cool to watch.  Are you kidding me?  These guys fighting for their country? 
[00:37:00]  It's such a big sport right now.  The Olympic Committee to get people watching.  Like, especially if the next one's in Brazil.  I mean, I saw...  Wait, when is Brazil?  That's in four years?  Yeah.  Rio.  That would be a perfect time, right?  That would be a massive success in Rio.  But here's the problem.  Can these guys turn around and have multiple fights, though?  Oh.  How does judo do it?  Don't they get beat up pretty good?  Yeah.  Yeah, they do boxing.  The rules are different.  I think they wear hats.  Yeah, they wear those boxing hats. 
[00:37:30]  But I guess if you're the one that beat the shit out of someone, then certainly you could  turn around and fight again.  Depending on how long...  If you have a war, it's got to be hard to come back.  But they have to do it in boxing.  Right.  They have to.  Yeah, I think that might be a problem.  I think you get more beat up in some of these MMA fights.  Yeah, you do get much more beat up than you would in boxing.  Because in boxing, they've got the headgear, right?  And they've got the just three-minute rounds.  So they're not really getting cut, you know?  Well, yeah, they've got them Olympic gloves. 
[00:38:00]  We've got Usain Bolt on the lower screen.  That guy has a memory forever.  Is this going down?  Because they're ahead of us, right?  Just right now?  Yeah, what would youngsters around the world give to have that interaction with Usain Bolt?  Has to be one of the most popular athletes on the planet.  6'5".  No question about that.  Dude, his arms are solid rock.  But wouldn't it be better if they were tiny arms?  Like little progeria arms?  T-Rex arms?  Yeah, little T-Rex skinny arms. 
[00:38:30]  They help him, I think.  Oh, he's doing a little pose.  That's his Bolt.  His Bolt.  It looks like Hulk Hogan's fucking thing.  No, no, that's the Bolt.  Does he do that before everyone?  No, he does.  He's hamming it up?  He's a little too...  I don't like he's being too hammy.  He's showboating.  He's stealing everything.  He did the ear thing like, hey...  Yeah, he's a big star.  What are you going to do?  He's a Bolt-A-Maniac.  That's a good one.  Oh, it's a heat.  What's that mean?  It's just the preliminaries.  What are they for? 
[00:39:00]  They weed him out and figure out who's going to go on.  And what you're going to see is when he knows he's got...  He made it, then he's going to slow down.  I hate when they kiss the cross up.  Stop with that showboating shit.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Well, at least we can watch his heat.  Oh, they all have to qualify for the next race?  Yeah.  And they slow down at the end when they know they got it.  Why?  Just to save it for the finals.  In lane four.  They're just used to hearing gunfire and then running.  It might be a little intimidating to him to have to see the imposing six-foot-five figure of Usain Bolt on his outside. 
[00:39:30]  Look at that motherfucker run.  Look, he's way ahead, everyone.  Oh!  And look, see, he's slowing down.  He's easing a lot.  See?  Yeah, yeah, look at him.  That's why it sucks.  He's not even trying.  And they'll cross the finish line with Usain Bolt in 20.39.  That's amazing.  Because he just kind of...  See, that's why those preliminaries and the heats and the rounds, it's just so worth watching. 
[00:40:00]  How do they stop that thing from jumping?  Like, the little thing that they...  The blocks they put their feet on?  Yeah.  Right.  How do they stop...  You're not going to say it.  ...that from kicking back?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's third grade Jimmy today.  I love third grade Jimmy.  With his cute little questions.  That's a real question.  Wouldn't you assume that the first time they tried to just lay it on the track and it flew backwards, that they would fasten it down? 
[00:40:30]  How, though?  And then they have to run around in a circle.  They fucking trip over it?  What do they do?  He said, be careful.  You remember those blocks are on the street?  In the street.  That was called a street.  I love it.  Oh, God.  You're hilarious.  I mean, they got to move the...  I would guess they would have somebody come out, perhaps, and pull it out of the stud that goes into the ground.  Yeah, that race, though.  During a metal collet. 
[00:41:00]  That race, they're not going to go all the way around to hit the blocks.  That's fucking great.  Or maybe the ones where they go around, the long distance, they don't...  Do they all bolt off those things or no?  Yeah.  No, some of the...  They're standing.  Yeah, some of the longer races, they just stand.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, I thought they all fucking started with that.  No.  Pew!  No, like, I think the 10K, they don't...  And other races.  Oh!  Oh!  I believe.  I did not know that.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Oh.  Olympic...  When are they over?  This weekend?  I'm done.  Yeah.  Closing ceremonies?  How long are the Olympics?  A month?  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Two quick weeks.  That's it.  Two weeks.  Oh, man.  Sam, did you finish your assignment?  Yes, I did.  I have the quintessential list.  What was your assignment?  Well, we...  Were you given an assignment?  We like taking a look at...  We like taking a look at Dr. Drew every once in a while. 
[00:42:00]  Yes, we do.  And one of his graduates made a complete asshole of herself over the weekend or yesterday.  One.  Another one of his success stories, you mean?  One of his success stories.  It's great if they're just not...  If they're not dying.  If they're doing anything but dying, he's happy.  What if they're slowly killing themselves?  Well, that's true.  And then, since we did this bit, we lost another one.  Yeah.  How many deaths?  Um...  How many success stories for Dr. Drew that ended up dying?  Okay.  Let me look at...  Save it for after the break.  Okay. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  Are we ready to go to break?  I think so.  Well, where's our grub?  Yeah, where's the fucking food?  Where's the chow?  Because if the food ain't here and we go to break...  What if you used to go on a break with no chow?  Then we start eating when it gets here and then we got to, you know, one minute.  We hear that, one minute.  We were listening to, uh, go to break Chip.  Yeah.  All of us in the office.  Fucking hilarious.  Fucking hilarious.  The first break went four and a half minutes before Chip sent it to break.  And then when we got back, you guys talked for two minutes and 30 seconds and Chip sent you to break again. 
[00:43:00]  I should do it two minutes and 20 seconds later.  Oh, stop.  No, we got it.  It was funny then.  Yeah.  Go to break?  No.  No.  No, we didn't even laugh.  Take a break or something.  Hey, break down.  What?  Break dance.  No.  Oh, God.  Break the floor.  All right.  That's funny.  A cocksucker.  He's so angry.  Well, I could do this.  Is Chip trying too hard?  Yeah.  It's so hard. 
[00:43:30]  I could do this.  All the sports are already on the schedule for 2016.  So you can't add MMA in 2016.  Sure.  Nothing to be added until 2020.  So the first chance MMA has is eight years from now.  That's how the Olympics work.  And do they already have stuff that they got to consider for 2020?  I would imagine.  What are those sports?  I bet they're futuristic ones.  Fucking jetpack flying.  Nice.  Right?  Gravity boot walking.  Mars rock lifting.  Right.  Yeah, I want to talk about Mars. 
[00:44:00]  I bet nothing's going to change.  I want to talk about Mars after the parade.  Fucking love that.  Are they firing him finally?  Oh, not that Mars.  That would be great.  And we used to send college-age kids to the Olympics for baseball.  2008 was minor leaguers, mostly double A.  Thank you, Rob Coleman, if that's true, from Buffalo.  And thank you to Brian in San Diego.  Brian Moore.  Thank you.  Wow.  Buffalo and San Diego checking in.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  And here comes our food.  So why don't we take a break?  Oh, we can do that.  Hey, I want to ask her about the event she was in. 
[00:44:30]  Look at him lumbering down the hallway.  That bag looks so little in his dumb big hand.  Yeah, exactly.  He probably has big bricks in it.  He's so strong.  I like bricks.  Let's not forget, Chicago, live broadcast Friday.  Yes.  Very psyched about that.  You got the promo with all the details to save us the work?  Yes.  All right.  Why don't you play it right now?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Hey, Jim Norton. 
[00:45:00]  We're doing the live show in Chicago, August the 10th.  We want you to be a part of it.  The oddest thing you own.  Bring stuff down.  There's going to be a cash prize for the weirdest shit that is yours.  Chip off the old block.  There's going to be this horrible chip impersonation contest.  Which will be enraging for everybody.  And worst breath.  You can make your breath bad, or you can just naturally have that hideous, dry, plaque breath.  And E-Rock will judge it.  You got to be 21 or older.  There are official rules and details at SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[00:45:30]  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are we getting topical?  No, we are not.  Oh, shit.  What is this?  Black keys.  I should know the black keys.  I'll be honest with you.  The black keys?  The black keys.  Oh, that's different. 
[00:46:00]  That bell doesn't sound loud.  There it is.  Why wouldn't you go with Philippe Petit, Walking the Tightrope?  Philippe Petit.  38 years ago today.  And play like, what's that song?  Huh?  I'm up on the Tidewire.  Could do Tightrope by, uh...  Who did Tightrope?  Stevie Ray Vaughan?  Look up Tightrope.  Yeah.  In between the Twin Towers.  That was crazy.  Something about being high. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, I would have went Stevie Ray Vaughan, Tightrope, and then we would have went, ah, Philippe Petit.  Right.  See what we could have done?  Let's see how we get this.  The black keys.  Huh?  This is better.  Bill Byrd just texted me.  He's really pissed off.  Uh-oh.  He has something he wants to say on the hotline.  He's not really pissed off.  I guess I'm exaggerating.  But he said, I called what I thought was the hotline, and some lady just hung up on me.  Oh, man.  So, I don't know why he doesn't have the hotline anymore, but we're calling him now to see. 
[00:47:00]  Maybe it's, yeah, a different number.  I would imagine he would have a great take on the Olympics.  Could we change it on him?  Maybe not.  Maybe he doesn't even watch it.  Huh?  Maybe he's not even watching it.  I think he's watching it.  Ah, jeez, Joe.  Bill Burr.  Jesus.  No?  Yellow.  Bill?  Yellow.  You're kidding, right?  Bill!  Hello, Bill.  Oh, boy.  No.  Bill?  No.  Bill?  All right.  Let me try something here. 
[00:47:30]  Let me do this.  Oh, fuck.  We don't have phones.  We don't have phones.  That's what's going on here today.  Mars is out.  We don't have phones.  I'm not going to bitch anymore.  I didn't hear a dial tone.  We had them in here on these phones.  No, I know, but I can't put them on the air.  So, should we all run in there, Iraq, and do the call?  Is that what you're saying?  Comment?  Should we just do a conference call?  What's that?  We don't get that.  You've got to push the buttons.  Old school. 
[00:48:00]  What?  Who's calling?  It's crazy.  What do you mean you have to push the buttons old school?  If you push the buttons...  Let me try over here now.  Let me do this now.  Nothing.  Now you do yours.  Nothing.  What?  So what do we got to do?  If you push these buttons...  Over there?  I can't reach that.  I'll get you the phone.  Get a stick.  Get a stick.  You just push it with a stick.  Who's calling?  Bill Burr.  Oh, okay.  Oh, man.  We were talking about Philippe Petit 38 years ago. 
[00:48:30]  He did that crazy tightrope walk between the Twin Towers.  God damn, that's nice.  And guess what?  He didn't have a tether?  No.  No tether for Philippe Petit.  No safety tether?  Nothing.  No safety tether?  What do I do?  Oh, man.  What is this?  Look at this.  This is a giant phone.  I hope he's got a giant phone in front of him.  This is a giant phone.  I'll help you.  What do I do?  This?  When it's time?  All right. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, and then how do you hang up?  Oh, no.  I'm trying to hang up the phone.  Oh, man.  You're going to break it.  You're going to fucking break the phone.  Oh, shit.  I hope he's going to break it.  Head slam it.  Take that.  Who's the boss?  You or that phone?  Oh, Jesus.  What do you mean stop?  I'm a child of the 80s.  This is how you hang up a phone.  Exactly.  With fervor.  He's going to break it.  No, he won't.  Stopping.  Well, how do you hang it up?  That's as hard as you hang a phone up.  Hang it up right.  Oh, Jesus.  Really?  You're not hanging it up right.  You want me?  Oh, yes.  You're hanging it up wrong.  You're fucking taunting him like Tommy. 
[00:49:30]  You're going to take that shit?  The dial tone is still going.  Now how do I call him?  Just have him call back.  Get the hotline.  Roll it.  Send him the hotline number.  Okay.  But if it starts going beep, beep, beep, beep.  Do we do nine?  No, I don't think so.  Do I do one?  Yeah.  Good idea.  Why turn it off?  No, I want to hear all that.  No, no, because then people know the numbers, and they'll be calling Bill Burr.  One or nine first?  One.  One. 
[00:50:00]  Two.  No, don't say it.  Oh, did I just say that?  But that's how I dialed numbers.  I don't know if I could do it without reciting it to myself.  Of course you can.  I'll try.  Wait, that wasn't down.  No, you got to turn it on.  I did turn it on.  All right, now dial.  All right.  One?  Yes.  Okay.  You see the hotline keeps on talking to some lady. 
[00:50:30]  I know.  That's why we're calling him.  Hold on a minute.  Do you need his number?  I'll give it to you.  All right, let's try that.  Is it ringing?  Is it going to ring?  There it is.  Oh.  Shh, shh.  Prank call.  Prank call of the week.  What do I do with this giant phone?  Phony phone calls.  Yeah.  Phony phone call.  You're on Z100.  Hello?  Hello, is this Bill Burr?  Hi, Bill.  Please tell me you can hear me. 
[00:51:00]  Yes, we can hear you now.  Yeah, I don't know what's going on.  For some reason, yeah, I kept going to the front desk.  The lady hung up on me.  It was hilarious.  I go, is this the Opie and Anthony hotline?  She goes, she's like, no, it isn't.  I go, well, can you direct me over there?  She goes, no, I can't.  I go, you can't direct me to one of the shows on your own network?  She goes, yeah, it's a really big network.  And then she just goes, okay, thanks.  And she hung up on me.  Oh, man.  Is that the receptionist up front?  I guess so. 
[00:51:30]  No, she's not in yet.  I don't know who it is.  So what was funny was when I just...  Wait, what number is it?  No, no, that's it.  Why?  Well, we need to know the number so we can call and figure out what that's about.  Because after the Bill Burr phone call, we're going to call her and ask her what her job is.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what we do.  I called her up and I got her twice.  So the second time I went through when I tried calling again, I got the same lady.  And I go, oh, this is the same lady.  I go, before you hang up on me, okay, thanks.  Oh, shit.  Wow, really? 
[00:52:00]  She hung up on you again?  No, no, no.  I hung up on her like the childish ass.  Okay.  I kind of like that, though.  I like it a lot.  What's up, Bill?  I am in the South Bend Airport.  South Bend?  Yeah, it's hilarious.  This is one of these airports that, you know, it's like, they're just like, okay, boarding  zone one.  And then two seconds later, they're like, okay, boarding zone two.  Yeah.  There's no one there.  Anybody who can hear me, just get on the plane.  You walk outside and hear, propellers are inches from your face. 
[00:52:30]  I'm like, self-conscious how loud I'm talking.  That's how few people are in like this airport right now.  You can tell.  Are you cupping your hand on the phone?  No, because that would be like sinister after 9-11.  That is true.  Yes, yes.  You got to be very careful.  That's funny.  Yeah, it's actually polite.  But, yeah, coming from yet another funeral, I think I'm just going to start walking around  in like a black suit.  Oh, Jesus.  At that age. 
[00:53:00]  Who died?  Another family friend.  Oh, okay.  I had to come out here for that, and I'm on my way to Foxwoods.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Yeah.  Do a little gambling.  No, doing a show.  Wow, Foxwoods.  It's a great gig.  Oh, we're going to be in Chicago.  I'm sitting here thinking, maybe I should go to Foxwoods and see Bill Burr.  What day?  Chicago.  Actually, tonight it's a private party for some company or something.  Oh, okay. 
[00:53:30]  I guess I'm performing in the gambler's suite.  Oh.  Wait, you're performing in a suite?  Bill, you're performing in a room?  No, no, no, no, no.  Jesus, Jim, after getting trashed for riding on a bus, I don't think I would bring that up to you.  No, you know what, though?  A high-roller suite gig, a guy like that could pay a tremendous amount of money just to have a comic come up and do something for him and 20 friends.  Just coke and whores watching you?  Yeah.  Yeah, but then later on you find out he's like some war criminal.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  You're entertaining someone.  Yeah, what kind of name is that?  Hey, Bill, you watching the Olympics?  Yes, I am.  Oh.  It makes you hate other countries.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I find England annoying with their excitement that they're in third place with the medals.  They're very excited when one of their people win over there in the U.K.  Well, they're the home...  Explain to me how a red-headed white guy wins the long jump competition. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Did that really happen?  Yeah.  It did.  That's funny.  Opie, this guy was more of a redhead than the two of us put together.  Oh, that's not good.  He was like a central casting redhead, and this dude jumped like 30 feet with his pasty  legs running in the air.  This guy, if anybody's screaming that I'm on PEDs, it has to be old flannery here.  Yeah, that doesn't seem like it was supposed to happen that way. 
[00:55:00]  And then they play that British national anthem, and us pompous Americans think it's our tune.  Because their national anthem, we ripped it off and made it like one of our little America  songs.  It's kind of embarrassing.  Years ago.  When you hear it, you're like, oh, shit.  So they play it.  It's like, let freedom ring.  That's ours.  And theirs is, yeah, God save the queen, or some shit.  And they play that, and all I'm thinking is, that's our song, you fucking assholes. 
[00:55:30]  Well, we plagiarized their foreign policy, so why would we stop that?  Oh, Bill.  Look at Bill.  Oh, he's so political.  No, no, no.  It's only because every time I go over there, they sit there and they trash America.  And it's like, what are you mad at us for?  We're doing everything that you did.  So the only thing you get mad at us for is stealing your evil.  That is true.  We did kind of copy them, aside from the no guns.  Okay, you know, what's funny is lately I've been staying in these hotels, and they have 
[00:56:00]  news like the CNN or the Fox News from all these different countries, and it's obviously  in a different language.  But the way they trashed the United States is hilarious.  They've got Al Jazeera.  I have Al Jazeera on my basic cable now.  Yeah, how great.  And I was watching them, and they were talking about, they just started talking about America.  And of course, I can't understand what they're saying.  And they just show some gigantic fat lady walking down the street, just shooting her from behind. 
[00:56:30]  It was hilarious.  And then I watched one.  It was the China one.  The China one showed all our athletes walking out to start the Olympics, carrying the torch  and all that.  And then they like smash cut to somebody looking at the label on their tracks, and it said  Made in China.  Oh, yeah.  And they come back to them, and they're like, hee-hee-hee, like laughing.  But they really do hate us.  We are hated worldwide.  Exactly. 
[00:57:00]  Yes, we are.  Doesn't really bother me.  But they do just bash us in England, right?  Yeah.  What's that?  They do just trash America in England.  That's what they do.  Well, not straight across the board, Jim.  I still think you should go over there.  I still think you'd have a good time.  But like, there's definitely, I find it more like people who come over to this country.  It's really annoying.  They come over, because they always talk about ignorant Americans, Australians.  English people, they'll come over here, and they'll be in your country, like, trashing  it.  Like, I could go to, like, I don't know, some complete shithole, and I would never trash 
[00:57:30]  it to someone who lived there.  Right.  Like, you guys realize you're drinking sewer water?  All right, I'm out of here.  You know, I would never do that.  I like the comedians I've met from over there, like Jimmy Carr.  And a lot of those guys are really, really funny acts.  I mean, I probably would enjoy it, because a lot of the guys that come over are funny.  We should take the show over there.  That'd be fun.  Our next trip should be international.  Hey, is our accent, like, beloved, like other accents are here?  Like, you know, you get an Aussie guy in the States, and chicks fucking love him, and 
[00:58:00]  the English accent and shit like that.  Absolutely.  Yeah, did the...  Absolutely.  Yeah, they will.  And there's always going to be some, somebody who doesn't like it, but there's, you know,  it's the law of averages.  There's going to be some girl who thinks it's hot.  Yeah?  You're asking if you can get laid in other countries, Anthony, I think you're good to  go.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, thanks, man.  I was just trying to figure that out.  All you've got to do is just start talking.  It's hilarious.  Just talk.  And then they'll be like, oh, I love the accent. 
[00:58:30]  And you'll be like, oh, okay.  I'm fucking balls deep.  Then you'll find yourself ramping up your American accent like you didn't even know you could.  Hey, like fucking New Yorker.  Yeah.  Do you like any of these Olympic sports, Bill?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm actually looking forward to the boxing.  There's supposed to be some woman boxer that we have that's supposed to be one of the toughest  women of all time.  And I'm looking forward to him beating the crap out of women from other countries.  What is she, my ex-wife? 
[00:59:00]  Who?  Come on now.  Yeah, I don't know.  I guess I'm into some of that.  But I've got to tell you, I used to like the gymnastics, but I'm a little confused with  some of these spastic movements that they're doing now in between the actually running and  doing some sort of flip.  Dude, that whole fucking little, like their arms, and then they put their nose up in the  air like three quick times, and then they fucking do a little thing with their arms and their 
[00:59:30]  legs, and then they start running.  It is weird.  Yeah.  What is that about?  Yeah, it's like, it's like some sort of voguing in between the two.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some kind of voguing.  I know.  It's the weirdest on like the balance beam.  Like they'll be like, the balance beam freaks me out.  Like if ever I think somebody's going to break their neck for some reason, it's on that.  Like that little two-by-four.  Yeah.  You can just hear the pounding of their feet into that thing. 
[01:00:00]  Boom.  Yeah, yeah.  They just keep doing that, and then they'll be standing there, and they'll poke their ass  out, and then they'll start voguing.  Like really like, like if a squirrel started voguing.  Like really like, like your eye can't, almost can't catch it.  Yeah, like when a bird takes a bird bath.  It's just, so fast.  It's really, like it's really a big hard thing. 
[01:00:30]  That is, I was just.  You guys see the, that Chinese woman who looks like the power lifter, who's the swimmer?  Who's basically, she's winning everything.  She improved her time by five seconds.  Oh, that crazy, yeah, the crazy swimmer.  Oh, the swimmer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everyone thinks she has to be on something.  Right.  Because she's like, she's like throwing water out of the pool.  She's got a rooster tail.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  Did you see the trampoline?  Is that an event?  Thank you, Bill.  Yes.  We were watching Friday.  We could not believe it.  It was on during our show, and they're just, they're just on a trampoline.  There's nothing you really could do with a trampoline.  Only so much you could do, so everything looks exactly the same, and they're trying to.  How many people are you really competing with when you're the best person on a trampoline?  Trampoline.  How do you go home proud with a medal for that?  Like, yeah, I got gold at the Olympics. 
[01:01:30]  Like, in what?  Yeah, the trampoline.  You have the gold, silver, and bronze from the same event?  Is it just you?  Because no one gives a fuck.  Yeah, I think that's...  You know, I saw, I was watching some of that Olympic field hockey, because they're dressed  like, you know, some mail-order whore with those flat skirts.  Yeah.  Dude, this is like, such like a topical joke from the 80s, but honestly, why don't they  make that stick longer?  Yes.  Yes.  We were just saying the same thing.  We were watching that yesterday during the show, and they can't even make a pass, because 
[01:02:00]  they can't control the ball.  The little stick.  All I do is, because I'm so old now, is I just think of how bad my back would hurt.  Hunched over trying to fucking play that dumb game.  Can you imagine being hunched over like that?  Oh, that would be...  At our age, fuck that.  And then you look at the shape of the club, it looks like it was made by cavemen, like  the first hockey stick ever made, when they had like primitive tools.  Like a club foot. 
[01:02:30]  It's a dumb hook.  It's really stupid.  The fucking end is obsidian, and it's put on with vine.  Might as well use an umbrella.  Hey, shit.  Some of these events are kind of stupid.  I don't get the ping pong.  They play doubles in ping pong now.  Not even enough room.  Yeah, the ping pong I respect, because that's played...  Like, those guys stand like 40 feet behind the table.  Yeah.  I mean, that's like, you know, I can jump on a trampoline and do a flip or some crap. 
[01:03:00]  Like, that doesn't impress me, but like, those guys are playing that at like, literally  like cartoon speed.  Yeah.  How quickly they do it.  You know what?  Yeah.  You're right.  Anything you can't do...  I guess you're right.  ...is impressive, you know?  What about badminton?  Badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton is for like the wives of the guys in the Illuminati.  Like, that's what they're supposed to do in the backyard, is they carve up the world.  Men are supposed to play that. 
[01:03:30]  We play badminton in our backyard.  We fucking hated it.  Yeah, you play in the backyard.  It's fun for maybe a half hour, and then you're like, this stinks.  So then we started hitting rocks with our badminton rackets, because you could...  It's pretty impressive how far you could hit a rock with a badminton racket.  Sounds very dangerous.  Yeah.  Indeed.  It was one of those things where you use the sport...  You use it in a different way to make it more exciting.  Yeah.  Badminton was one of those.  I don't know. 
[01:04:00]  I like when people just fall and fuck up, and I don't like a perfect...  I kind of like the perfect ones and then the falling.  Yeah.  Anything in between is just ho-hum to me.  You know what?  I like that one where they're running basically a marathon, and then out of nowhere there'll  just be a random hurdle, and then there's that one where you have to land in the puddle.  The steeplechase, I think.  The steeplechase.  Or something like that.  Yeah.  I thought that was...  This hurls, and then... 
[01:04:30]  No, they have to land in the water.  He's right.  It's such a dumb sport.  It's always one guy who wipes out.  Well, yeah.  It's like a huge hurdle.  Hey, you know something?  I've been...  Whenever I watch the track, I always watch the white person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And just...  We're getting closer.  We're only losing by like three seconds now.  Yeah, we're getting closer.  Not in the marathon, though.  The body is looking at the look of determination on the white sprinter's face. 
[01:05:00]  Like, they are literally using every ounce of their being to stay within the pack.  And then the black guy's effortless.  Effortless.  They're effortless.  They're not even breathing heavy by the end of their sprints.  Yeah.  And the white guy's doubled over in pain and needs a massage.  He just...  Phil's right.  No, they just start the race in a grimace, and it just gets tighter as they're going.  All their muscles are tight. 
[01:05:30]  Like they're trying to shit.  No, it's hilarious.  Very good.  I always watch it.  I watch it with me all the time.  I always go, look at the white guy.  Look at the white guy.  Look at the white guy.  That's kind of funny.  And made a great observation.  The first week of the Olympics is the white Olympics, and the second half is the black Olympics.  Yeah.  Because all the swimming events...  Huh?  You've got to have the headliner go on last.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, the black Olympics are a little more exciting as far as track and field and shit like that. 
[01:06:00]  Although some of those...  They're shredded from running.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're like every single muscle.  They get like biceps from running.  I can see your legs.  You ever watch bicycle racing?  They have no arms, no upper body, but they're all legs, and it makes sense.  Like, I would think with running, you'd be all legs.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think it's...  I was saying, I think you're saying both.  It seems like his arms would almost slow him down because he's so muscular.  It's like if his arms were lighter... 
[01:06:30]  I bet you if you saw him, his arms are pretty slender, actually.  Just well-defined.  I don't know.  He's a big dude, man.  He's 6'5".  Yeah.  And you need some more muscles in these track and field events.  Maybe they help propel you?  Oh, yeah, you've got to pump those fucking arms.  Oh, you'd look silly with no arms running.  You really look dumb.  I don't think it would work.  No, but these guys, they're like jacks.  They look like they're playing football.  Yeah.  They're big guys.  But I didn't think of that until you just said, like, the motion of the back and forth 
[01:07:00]  of the arms probably helps you go faster.  Have you guys seen that, the American woman powerlifter?  Yeah.  I saw her on an interview, and she's trying to tell people that she's still a lady, a  girl, you know, just another girl out there.  No, she's hilarious.  She's, like, self-deprecating.  But I've got to tell you, dude, the weight she's putting up is ridiculous.  Yeah.  Isn't that amazing?  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry. 
[01:07:30]  She's putting up, like, I don't know, like 225, 250 over her head.  Jesus Christ.  Is that a lot for a weightlifter, though?  She could, well, for a woman.  Dude, if I was in a relationship with her, she could basically pick me up over her head  and throw me across the room, and there's nothing I could do about it.  Is that Mangold's sister?  Yeah, somebody, some NFL player's sister, but she's a riot, man.  Her name's Holly Mangold.  That's Nick's sister from the Jets. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, okay.  You came in one time.  Yeah, she's, like, I think she weighs 350 pounds.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at it.  She looks just like her brother.  Oh, my fucking God.  Yeah, look at that.  That's crazy.  What is this?  Oh, man.  Wait, Bill, how much is she lifting over her head?  I have no idea, but it looked like, you know, those big 45 plates you have at the gym.  She looked like she had at least two on both sides.  She does, two on each side, yep. 
[01:08:30]  She's got three on each side.  I think the skinnier ones are the 45s, and are the thicker ones what?  Who knows this shit?  I don't know, but, I mean, well, once the bar starts bending at about 315,  he used to lift with this guy, and he could do three on each side.  And that's right when the bar starts bending, so I don't know.  Well, we're looking at a picture of her.  The bar is absolutely bending slightly.  Wow.  So that's got to be over 315 pounds, then.  What a monster.  Do you know what the weight is? 
[01:09:00]  Does it say, Sam?  Heavy.  A lot.  Is she going to win the gold?  Oh.  You're asking me?  I mean...  Is she the favorite, is what I'm saying?  Um, I don't know.  It's like such a, I think it's like right up there with like the trampoline thing,  where there's like six people competing.  Right.  I really don't have any idea, but...  Well, that's one of those events you're just hoping your elbow doesn't give out.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:09:30]  It's gotten so ridiculous that the weight, it's crazy where, you know, there's a good possibility.  What is she doing?  There's a picture of her, uh, on a, on a, she's lifting up, um, two regular normal girls  on the end of a weight bar.  They're hanging on to it, and she's lifting up, uh, you know, attractive girls.  Oh, yuck.  Yeah, with ease.  Yes.  He said attractive girls.  Yes.  Wow.  I mean, let's be fair.  She's a beast.  She really is a fatso.  If you guys want to like, some of the sickest YouTube videos are those, those, uh, power 
[01:10:00]  lifter accidents where people just blow up their knees.  Oh, yeah.  Or just drop their weight.  I, I can't even watch them.  We played one recently where the guy was lifting so much that he passed out and hit his head  on the, the back rack.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good one.  You got to see that one, Bill.  I've seen, you ever seen the one with a kid, actually, he, he, it's like a deadlift.  You basically just stand up with the weight and then drop it back down.  The kid does it successfully and then yells like, and then passed out. 
[01:10:30]  He does a face plant off these dumbbells.  It's actually, uh, looks pretty, pretty painful.  I'll try to find that one.  That might be the same one.  Yeah, it might be the same one.  It was pretty funny.  All right.  Well, listen, they're about ready to, uh, I'm about ready to get on this little putt-putt  jet here.  Oh, boy.  How long of a flight from Indiana to, uh, Foxwoods?  Well, I actually got to go to Detroit first and then, uh, oh, okay, okay. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Were you doing a gig or a college?  Oh, it's a, it's a summer.  It's obviously a regular.  I was doing a funeral.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I was at a funeral.  Okay, buddy.  Another funeral there, Jimmy.  And I, uh, highly recommend people check out the, uh, the podcast, Bill Burr.  The Monday Morning Podcast.  That's right.  All right.  Well, I appreciate you guys dealing with my medium energy.  No, it was fun.  No, no, it was nice.  You know, Bill, I always say, dear Lord, let me laugh, but don't let me forget that I 
[01:11:30]  cried.  Take that with you.  What new awful character is this one going to be?  That's just the old lady that we do.  Yeah, she's always around.  Oh, yes, of course.  I thought Chip was getting spiritual.  Yeah, I know.  Chip is, uh, going strong.  Have a safe flight, brother.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Bill.  Bill Burr, everyone.  Bill Burr.  It's a funny take on the list.  The Bill Burr.  Yeah.  No.  It's not hanging up.  The fucking phone doesn't understand English unless you took... 
[01:12:00]  Oh, you're going to break it.  Now, what's the phone number of that other lady?  I want to know why she wouldn't put Bill Burr through.  Right.  Let's talk to...  Oh, we should have got it from Bill.  Oh, shit.  We didn't get it from Bill?  Howell and Bill can text it.  Make sure he...  Can you catch this?  Yeah, go ahead.  Toss it.  Sammy, grab it.  No.  Please catch this.  Sammy, the boss is telling you to catch something.  Sam, get on the...  Please.  No.  Just leave it where you are.  You need it.  Feel how heavy this is.  Let me see the number that, uh...  It's fucking heavy.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  I thought you wanted it over there. 
[01:12:30]  Isn't that where it goes?  It does go there.  You've got to keep it by you.  That's where it goes.  You've got to answer the phones today.  Oh, phones.  You have to keep it by you today.  Whoops.  Why?  What's wrong with the phones?  Tell the bosses we need a new computer screen.  Eh, kind of went into it a little.  No.  It's all right.  Should be.  Should be all right.  Well, it did kind of...  Yeah.  Oh, I should...  I wish I would have said that.  I would have said,  that's going to leave a mark.  Ah!  That's what I'm finding in one of the movies.  Good one.  Good.  Oh, boy.  Please.  Yeah, I was kidding about dialing one, asshole. 
[01:13:00]  Jesus.  Just sit back and listen to the show.  Relax.  Fucking idiots.  There are some dumbbells out there.  There really are.  Or try to do a better radio show.  There you go.  There's your two choices.  Ooh.  Challenge.  You don't want the number?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Call that lady.  Okay.  What?  What lady?  Don't give the number out over the air,  because then we could just...  So what do I do?  This?  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  Call her up.  We're calling a lady.  We're waiting for somebody to give me the number.  E-Rock.  Oh, what are you doing in there?  Eating fudge?  He doesn't like chocolate.  I know.  Remember?  He likes regular food.  That's so weird.  Oh, he just has salads every day for some reason.  Yeah, right.  Thank God he's not a dessert guy, though.  With a lot of dressing.  I caught him in there making a Coke float.  Coke float?  You're making Coke floats today, E-Rock?  What's wrong with you?  He calls them breakfast shakes, though,  if he drinks them in the morning.  Oh, God.  Puts a little protein powder in there.  A breakfast shake. 
[01:14:00]  A Coke float.  What's he doing?  He gave me the number for the hotline.  I don't have the number, Bill.  Just get it into the phone.  It's the front desk.  What's wrong with you?  It's just an extension.  I don't have the full number for...  Holy shit.  Why are you yelling, E-Rock?  We know what the first part of the number is.  Holy shit, E-Rock.  Holy shit.  What, is that some kind of hit joke?  Why is E-Rock yelling?  I don't know.  You all right, E-Rock?  He's having phone troubles.  He's very...  Yeah.  Sounds like someone's got a dimmer on the brain.  Now, what's the first part?  It says the phone number of that phone. 
[01:14:30]  You sure that's the same number, though?  What's the beginning?  Yeah, I don't know if it's the same number.  So, you think Bill's boarding?  I'll write him back.  Yeah, just see if he's...  Let's see.  Try that.  What are you talking about?  All right, I have the number for the front desk.  I bet it's not.  It's not the front desk because they probably have a service that answers the phone at off  hours, because I don't think anybody's at that desk yet.  I think there are.  Are there really?  I'm not sure.  And he did say that they answered as SiriusXM.  We'll see. 
[01:15:00]  Well, they will do that.  Is there an old hotline number?  I don't know what number.  Maybe Bill Burr was dialing?  I don't know.  He should be dialing.  Yeah, he should be up to date.  Give him a text.  I give him a text.  We'll see what happens.  Shoot Billy Boy a text.  What, Sam?  No, I mean, I got this number.  All right, let's try that.  Fuck it.  What else are we doing right now?  It's being a...  Boop, boop, boop.  I'm not hearing anything.  I don't hear anything.  That's good. 
[01:15:30]  I didn't hear a dial tone, though, either.  Uh-oh.  No, I had the thing up, too.  I think the phone might be broken.  It's definitely up.  Yeah, your button's pushed.  Try to push in the plug-in.  Why is the phone broken, Sam?  Put the plug, Sam.  It's all breaking.  Why is the phone broken?  Put the goddamn thing back on there.  What the hell's wrong with that phone?  Hang it up.  Hang it up.  You're fucking a plain game.  It's all tangled.  You're all fucked up.  What are you doing?  Wrap it around.  Why is the phone broken, Sam?  Hang it up, you boob.  Now do it.  Now do it.  Is there a reason the phone's broken? 
[01:16:00]  There you go.  There it is.  See?  Turn the...  Can you please turn me down?  Sure, no problem.  Let her rip.  Oh, it doesn't make the sounds.  What are you doing?  Oh, stop it.  Dial the number, Sam.  Oh, gosh.  Stop doing that, Edgar.  Edgar's poking Sam while he's trying to dial the phone.  Stop!  Look at that Steven Singer wedding band.  It looks good, actually, on his hand.  It's shiny.  It would look better on his neck, but it does look good on his hand.  Nice and shiny.  Is it ringing? 
[01:16:30]  It's busy.  Busy.  That isn't the fucking number.  Let me try it one more time.  That's so not the number.  Queer.  Oh, wait.  I might have got a...  Hold on.  Let me see.  Did you get a text from...  It was the hotline number.  For some reason, it went to her instead of your show.  Let me try it.  Well, try it, then.  Call the hotline number.  I'll do it right now.  What's wrong with you?  Why wouldn't Bill just give me the number he dialed?  I know!  Because we have a few hotline numbers.  Yes!  Tell him.  Text him and say, hey, asshole.  What number is this?  This is the hotline.  This is the hotline. 
[01:17:00]  Are you the lady that hung up on Bill Burr?  No, I'm not.  Are you the handsome intern?  Yes, I am.  Boo.  Boo.  So the hotline number.  He's got the wrong hotline number.  He's got the wrong number.  Yeah.  You've got to get the number that he has.  All right.  So I've got to tell him he's got the wrong number.  Give me the number you call.  Roland have it?  Because I saw Roland had a number in his phone.  Just say, oh, yeah?  Well, what's the hotline number?  What number did you say?  What number do you have?  We need the number.  Physically give us the number.  Yes.  Smart ass.  Call him smart ass.  Yes.  Yeah, smart aleck.  Let's keep it.  Okay, you're right.  As Colin would say, keep it PG. 
[01:17:30]  By the way, Russell Peters is coming in today.  At 9 p.m.  9 a.m.  I am.  The number you called.  I D G A C.  Cause we want.  I don't give a care.  I don't give a care.  Yeah.  Fuck with that.  Fuck with.  Damn, Colin's hilarious.  How funny is he on Twitter?  Oh, it's the best.  All right, here we go.  Go ahead.  Ready?  Hit what?  Try another number.  Which one?  All right, I'm going to. 
[01:18:00]  Okay, I'm going to give the one that Roland gave him.  All right.  Oh.  We might be on to something.  Yeah, Roland probably hit it wrong.  All right.  This is cool.  I like this experimenting.  I do too.  This is what real radio is.  We just go ahead and wing it.  Oh, it's the same busy stupid thing.  Oh, come on.  All right.  What about your number? 
[01:18:30]  Did Bill send you?  He hasn't written back yet.  God damn, Burr.  He's too busy.  Oh, Bill, what are you doing?  Jesus, Bill.  What are you doing?  Jesus, Bill.  What the fuck?  He's too busy.  He's boarding a plane.  He doesn't have time for this nonsense.  He's got time.  Oh, man.  I think we're going to take a break.  Hopefully, Bill Burr will write us back.  Yeah.  Get to the bottom of this bitch at the other end of the phone.  We're going to talk about Jeffrey Ross, and we're going to talk about Dr. Drew's success  stories.  And a little busy signal for you.  And a little busy signal as we go to break. 
[01:19:00]  Enjoy.  Be busy.  Be busy.  Sirius XM.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Can we just come back after a song?  Hi.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, everybody.  Yeah.  We got lots going on.  We are really fast because Bill Burr was talking about it.  The power lifting broad. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  She's a Chinese woman.  And we got the video queued up here as she wins the gold.  Oh, man.  She does the clean and jerk.  It's called the clean and jerk.  And she did 400.  How many pounds?  Oh, okay.  How many?  All I have is a combined record.  Combined record?  Combined record.  What do you mean?  Combined record.  What's the greatest hits?  Ah, that is good.  Get out of here, test.  What is a combined record? 
[01:20:00]  What are you talking about?  What's 734 pounds combined world record?  What does that mean?  412 pounds in the clean and jerk.  Right.  All right.  So we're going to see the 412 pound lift.  This is a Chinese broad lifted 412 pounds over her head.  Yes.  Jesus.  That ain't chop silly.  That's a good one.  I know it is.  More than one way to skim cat, motherfucker.  The Opie and Anthony Show is looking for some overweight ladies who might be attending our 
[01:20:30]  live broadcast in Chicago on August 10th and would like a chance at a serious cash prize.  We're thinking about doing the first ever Opie and Anthony pig race, and we need some willing  and able larger ladies to participate.  If you're interested, send an email to opanthony at siriusxm.com and keep an eye out for the  official rules.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my God.  They love it or hate it.  Oh, man. 
[01:21:00]  Do they ever.  It's about 50-50 there, Jim Norton.  It's Chip is an asshole.  Next one.  Fuck you, Chip.  Just fuck you.  Then it's, oh, my God.  I fucking love Take Us to Break, Chip.  I hate Take Us to Break, Chip.  I got, it's a cute bit, but now my entire drive has been ads.  And then I'm getting blamed.  Sorry.  And then Slotchy, funny the first time, annoying now.  Yeah, good.  He just bought another one.  For the people that don't know, it's go to Break, Chip. 
[01:21:30]  I don't know where this one came from.  I don't know.  Now it's our job to make sure that doesn't happen.  Can we go back to the power lifter, please?  Oh, the Chinese power lifter.  And once again, proving our theory correct, she's got the Chinese haircut because the Chinese  don't care as much as the Japanese.  The Japanese do stuff with their hair.  Well, they don't like it being just regular kind of Asian hair, which is normally straight  and black.  But the Chinese, for the most part, they don't care. 
[01:22:00]  They don't care.  But here she is.  This is what Bill Burr was talking about.  She lifts 412 pounds over her head.  I got to see this.  All right.  Here we go.  If anyone did this, it would be impressive.  And it's a woman on top of it.  Well, that's debatable.  Well, they're not known for, you know.  It's debatable.  I see what you're saying.  Oh, God.  Big knees.  She's making noise.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  It's under.  I don't have a lot of volume over here, sir.  I can't say under the chin.  People might think it's under her.  You got it? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Oh.  Holy fuck.  Wow.  What a gut.  Oh, my God.  She salutes crazy militaristic fucking government.  The volume's shitty on our PC today, too.  God damn it.  She's a fucking beast.  A bruiser.  I guess we really do need Mars.  A lot of little things.  You know, you never realize how much Mars does.  Where is he?  He doesn't do a thing.  He's on Mars.  Unplug it.  Plug it back in.  Mars went to Mars.  Mars is on Mars.  Unplug the goddamn thing. 
[01:23:00]  Damn, that's a good volume.  Yeah, we didn't get to hear the crowd noise.  Everyone going, wow.  I know.  Crazy.  She should do something with her hair.  Look very straight and black.  I maybe try to get a nice American girl.  I dye my hair.  Red color.  Like your crazy mass murderer, James Holm.  I thought you were going to say Rindsey Rohan. 
[01:23:30]  Sometimes I grow out very wrong.  Very wrong.  And breach or cut out.  And look like a jota.  Well, I guess Comedy Central is cutting the Jeffrey Ross joke.  They ain't going to let that fly no fuck way.  But I think the, well, they're not going to let the Colorado gunman joke go. 
[01:24:00]  Right.  That was funny.  I thought the joke itself was pretty good.  Didn't they leave Gilbert's joke in about 9-11, though?  Yeah, but I mean, that was years after, right?  No.  No, it wasn't?  No.  I ain't done it at all.  Oh, I think we needed to laugh.  There was a stopover at the Empire State Building?  No.  That was right after 9-11?  I actually, I sent a joke to Amy that was like that, but she didn't want to use it.  She was smart not to.  Jeff's was something like Seth Green. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  He said something about, like, hey, I haven't seen you since you shot those people.  Seth, you haven't gotten this much attention since you shot all those people in Aurora.  Yeah.  You're actually not like James Holmes.  He was doing things in the theater that people remember.  It's a very funny slam.  Very funny.  And it is a roast where they really go for it, too.  And he's not going to get in any trouble for it.  No, but Comedy Central, I guess, is in a tough spot with that, huh?  No surprise, of course they're going to cut that.  I almost understand it, yeah.  Knowing them is what I'm saying. 
[01:25:00]  I mean, you know, from a network's point of view, it's just like, eh.  Yeah.  But I think the Sandusky shit should fly.  They're debating on whether to use that even?  No.  Come on.  That's what I heard.  Really?  What was his Sandusky joke?  Do you know?  Well, I don't know, but I mean, he came dressed like Paterno.  Yeah, and he was dressed like Paterno the whole roast.  The entire time.  Yeah.  Well, that's his thing now.  Didn't he do Qaddafi last roast?  Did he?  Oh, he goes in costume and costume now?  Yeah, but he's picking the good costume.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:25:30]  The good costume.  He's ballsy, man.  One thing Jeff is not is fucking frightened.  He's really a confident performer, which I really admire.  Hey, Travis, I had a question from earlier.  Did we never send our major leaguers to the Olympics?  Not that I remember.  Maybe back in the old days.  I think it might have been the World Cup or whatever they call it.  Well, they do the World Baseball Cup.  Okay, I got those two confused.  What do you got?  I solved the mystery of the hotline number.  Oh. 
[01:26:00]  Can we call it?  No, there's no reason to.  I already did.  Oh.  You want to know who it is?  Who it is?  It's Summer Games Radio on SiriusXM.  What?  What's Summer Games Radio?  It's for the Olympics.  Ew.  Apparently our hotline number was given to them as a temporary number.  Ah.  So let's talk Summer Games with them.  Yeah.  Call them up.  Yeah.  We could have Ant prank them and then just be a great caller.  I've been known to do that.  Well, we call them on the air.  Tell them we want to talk to Summer Games.  Don't you know what the best part of that? 
[01:26:30]  I listened to that the other day.  Yeah.  He lowers his voice.  Oh, wow.  That's a great point.  Oh, wow.  That's a great point.  And I'm like, fuck yeah.  That's a great point.  You wait till I slam it.  Oh, shit.  God damn it.  No, he didn't do that.  Can we hear that again?  It's terrible.  It's one of our go-tos.  Listen to Matt Cow's voice where he changes.  He goes, oh, wow.  That's a really great point.  No, I was just trying to rope him in so he trusted me as a caller.  And then I was going to blindside him with some fucking harassment. 
[01:27:00]  Sure you were.  And then he did that thing where, you know, they hang up on the caller and then proceed  to answer the question without you on the line.  Right.  We got that quickly, Rock.  All right.  Here it is.  Tony in New York.  Hello.  Matt Cow, love you.  Love the show, man.  Thanks, buddy.  Hey, I want to talk a little bit about this Britain situation with the sailors that were  taken hostage, as I see it.  Yeah.  There's a problem.  I don't see the president speaking out on this.  And now I'm hearing that the United States has been told not to comment by Britain because 
[01:27:30]  of the world view of our country.  The British are telling us to please stay out of this so as not to make trouble.  I see this as maybe Britain turning on us a little bit as an ally in this situation.  What do you think about this?  Well, I think that's a, boy, I think that's a brilliant thing.  Thank you.  Thank you, Matt.  I think we need to keep our nose out of it right now. 
[01:28:00]  I think we got all, we're like that, well, Sam Childers knew this pygmy woman in Uganda.  She's a nice girl.  She's always sticking her nose in people.  And I think we need to keep our nose out of everybody's business right now.  And I think England is saying, let us handle it.  And I'm okay with that for now.  But you better believe if it starts to hit the fan, once again, we'll be there.  To save them, it's the Man Cow Show.  Man Cow.  Fuckers cut me off.  I knew that was going to happen, too.  Yeah, you should have done them in the middle. 
[01:28:30]  It was tough, though.  It was actually a valid question.  I was waiting to come back.  That's why I said, do you?  Like, shit like that.  Wouldn't it be funny if Anthony just became a caller to the Man Cow Show?  I never confronted him.  That's pretty much what just happened, Jimmy.  I just...  Now we're back live.  That sucked.  But you hear how he lowers his voice?  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's brilliant.  That's brilliant.  Oh, that's brilliant.  Then gets back into that doozy voice of his.  Turd!  God, I suck.  Why?  You made a good point.  I got caught up.  There were so many opportunities for me to lay into him. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, but you liked what he told you.  Brilliant.  You were enrolishing that moment.  I did.  I got all caught up in the moment.  You got distracted by the, yeah, the ego thing.  Compliment got me.  I was waiting.  You're stroking that ego, and you're like, oh, wow.  I was going to do it after one more compliment.  I was waiting.  The do you part should have been you.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes, right.  That was obvious.  I should have laid right in.  At that point, you should have been a douchebag.  Exactly.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  You're fucked.  We got a pool party to go to.  That's all I know.  Oh.  Look at that. 
[01:29:30]  I got mine.  Mr. Anthony Cumia, you are invited to intern Rob's pool party.  Whoa.  And it's a homemade invitation.  Should I hold the time, place, address, phone number, RSVP up to the PalTalk cam?  You should.  And show everybody where the address is.  Of course.  And the phone number to RSVP.  There is a when.  There's a where.  There's a time.  There's a number to RSVP, like you said.  Yeah.  I want to start by saying this comes across extremely needy.  Oh.  They're homemade invitations out of some form of construction type paper. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  It's written in crayon or crayon.  Who says crayon?  I don't know.  I say crayon.  All right.  You want to know what they say in Philly?  Crayon?  Crayon.  Crayon.  Anybody?  That's awful, whatever it is.  It's horrendous.  No one has it?  No.  Crayon.  Wait.  Crayon.  It amazes me every time.  Crayon?  Crayon?  Nope.  Crayon.  Any crayons?  Nope.  You got any colored pencils?  Nope.  Crane?  Nope.  Crown?  Yes. 
[01:30:30]  Crown?  Yes.  Crown?  Yes.  Crown?  You got a crown?  I thought it was just my wife and then.  A crown?  Is it like crown?  It's crayon, but they're saying it's so-  And it's a crown.  Crown?  Crown?  But the accent, it's crayon, but the accent's so heavy-  Crown.  Is that crown?  Crown?  Well, that's weird.  That's fucking weird.  And lollipops are something weird.  Oh, lollipops are ours?  In Philly, anyone?  Suckers?  Nope.  This one will blow away.  Penises?  Penises.  There you go. 
[01:31:00]  They call them taffies.  What?  They're lollipops.  Give me a taffy.  Wait, wait.  No, they don't.  I swear to you.  A taffy?  Who calls it a taffy?  Where are my Philly people at?  So what do they call taffy?  I guess taffy.  Yeah.  Fuck, everything's taffy down there to those people.  That's stupid.  Hey, give me my taffies.  What?  On my shoes.  They say crown for crayon, and they say taffy for lollipop.  Everything else.  A crayon.  How weird is that?  I could kind of see it.  Crayon.  Crayon.  Crayon.  Crayon.  Crayon, yeah.  It's saying it very... 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, crayon.  Crayon.  Ha ha, that's stupid.  I kind of think it is, too.  Oh, man.  I love those people down there, but that is dumb.  Yeah.  That's a dumb one.  Also, he went around the edges of these invitations with a scissor, and I see it's probably a little  slit to make it fringy around the edges.  Every, I would say, 16th to an eighth of an inch thickness.  Oh, really?  And, um...  Did your mom help you, Brad?  That's a lot of work. 
[01:32:00]  She didn't.  It was arts and crafts time at Rob's house.  Let me explain what happens at my house when the scissors come out.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  My mom used the scissors to cut people out of family photographs that she was pissed off  at.  Did she really?  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  That's kind of wacky.  I should take pictures of that.  Oh, God.  Yes, you should.  You could tell who she was pissed off at by going through the photo album.  The missing fucking photos?  It was so fucked up.  Also, I'm like, oh, really?  We're going to make believe we don't have a brother anymore because you're mad at him?  Oh, man.  Literally, his head cut out of photographs. 
[01:32:30]  Wow.  That's what happens at our house, Rob.  So, needless to say, you didn't have mother-son arts and crafts time.  Yep.  My mom didn't help me.  I did it during Breaking Bad.  I watched Breaking Bad and just made these.  Aren't you the perfect kid?  Jesus Christ.  I'll just bide my time.  Oh, my God.  I need some chocolate-covered strawberries badly.  These are very good.  Stop. 
[01:33:00]  Hope is 100% right.  There you go.  Crowns and taffies.  Crowns and taffies in the morning.  Cram.  Crowns and taffies in the morning.  Yeah, that's great.  Crowns and taffies.  That's funny.  Get to a break.  No, it's not.  No, no, no.  You don't get to call the breaks.  Not Edgar.  Edgar.  Never Edgar.  Jesus Christ.  Of course not.  So, what's going to be happening at this shindig, Rob, that would make me go all the  way over the Tappan Zee Bridge to fucking get to your house? 
[01:33:30]  And is it your parents' house?  Yeah.  Oh, that's adorable.  Which, by the way, you know what the Tappan Zee Bridge is right by?  Best Chester.  Best Chester.  So, what food can we get on the way to Rob's pool party?  Do you want to do the West Chester food tour on that day and then go to Rob's pool party?  No.  I kind of want to do the food tour.  Go to one of those food tours.  I kind of want to do the food tour.  Threw away rest stop.  Who else is in?  Then you're dumb fucking what?  Anthony, Jim?  No.  What's the date?  West Chester food tour?  Oh.  You got excited for a second, Sam. 
[01:34:00]  Why aren't we talking to the Olympic channel?  Would you like to give them a call?  Yeah, man.  Give them a ring-a-ding.  Yeah, let's ring-a-ding.  Sam, we just want to talk about the whatever.  Okay.  You want to talk about the pool party?  We can wait on that, Sam.  I'm just saying that's something we could do.  Oh, okay.  We're in the middle of the intern Rob's pool party.  So, what's going on?  Well, give me a little fucking sell this thing.  Well, there's going to be a lot of beer and alcoholic beverages.  Oh, well.  There's a pool.  What he said he does there. 
[01:34:30]  How old are you?  21.  All right.  So far, that's two things that I have in abundance at my own house.  Yes.  Now, mom and dad will be there to make sure it doesn't get too loud and there's no nude  girls.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Let's see how you party at Anthony's house.  Yeah, really?  You think his mom and dad are going to be kind of the cool parents, but there's always a  tipping point where even the cool parents are like, all right, look, man.  Look, when they see their son being raped in the bathroom.  Is it going to be like, hey, no horseplay by the pool?  None of that horseplay. 
[01:35:00]  It's an above-ground piece of shit.  Oh, God, is it?  Oh, no, no.  Fast forward, people are doing bumps off girls' tits, and then the parents have to come  out, all right, you know, we were trying to be cool, but.  Fucking lose shots.  It's great.  Yeah, would you be uncomfortable, like, if your dad got really drunk and you walked into  the bedroom and he was, like, rubbing Roland's back with a half a heart on?  Making that noise.  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy.  Jimmy can conjure up some awful fucking images.  No, but just as you open the door, you just see the front of his shorts jump as he's rubbing 
[01:35:30]  Roland's back.  And he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, your friend got hurt.  Oh, your friend got hurt.  Is that the pool?  That's the pool.  When do we see the pool?  It's pretty nice.  It's a boring pool.  It's very big.  It's just rectangular.  It's a square, rectangular pool.  It's got a little basketball hoop off of it.  Of course the perfect family has a rectangular pool.  Of course.  And the basketball hoop for family fun.  Of course.  For family entertainment.  Of course.  Yes, Dad.  Oh, Mom's going deep. 
[01:36:00]  Maybe a little pool volleyball.  Whoa.  In there.  Marco Polo.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Topless?  I think he's not.  It's not going to be topless.  It definitely can be topless.  With the girls?  Are there going to be girls, first of all?  No, it's going to be a door of a park.  Where are the Bucksotics?  They're going to be girls.  Yeah?  Have you looked at his invitations?  Some of the girls that you make believe you have sex with, or are these girls that you've  actually used to?  Now, wait a minute.  They're girls.  It's a party, so you're inviting girls you know from outside of this fucking place.  So they're girls your age, which are 21, and they'll be coming to the party. 
[01:36:30]  Yes.  So who are they?  I don't know.  Just from where?  A bunch of friends.  School?  Can we see pictures of some of the girls that will be at the pool party?  Show us some of the girls that will be attending, and I'll tell you right away if  anyone is going to go.  Yeah, and how many...  You're not going to sell me with booze in a pool, okay?  How many young girls are we talking?  Yeah.  As many as, uh...  Because right now, you have a pile of invitations for a bunch of dudes. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, but that...  Uh-huh.  How many barely legals?  The cock party.  How many barely legals?  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't...  There are a couple 18-year-olds I could get there.  Yes.  You could get there, but you haven't invited them yet.  Well, I mean, it's two weeks out.  Look how annoying that gets.  Then you could.  You haven't invited them yet, though.  Jesus.  It's so pissy.  What's...  This is going to half-half.  Come on, let's see.  This party is going to be a fun...  It's going to be a picnic table with plastic forks and plates on it. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  Wow-wee.  Holy fuck!  Who's that tit-fucking-lady?  Who's that?  Holy fucking...  Wow.  Is she going to be there?  You digress.  Where do you know her from?  How do you know her?  She lives in your town?  Oh, no.  They're just friends, and she politely accepted his request.  No, not at all.  Does she do stuff?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Go!  I haven't gotten...  It's so going to this party.  Oh, she's sticking her tongue out.  Good name.  Look at those fucking tits.  Mushed.  Oh!  Up the skirt. 
[01:38:00]  Yay!  Go back!  Holy shit.  Fucking Peter Pumper.  I want to see her, man.  What the fuck, man?  Look at her fucking...  Slow down a little bit.  Yeah.  She's going to be there for sure?  Yeah.  She has fucking hair like Tanner Boyle.  Have you texted her yet?  Wonderful.  Tanner Boyle.  Wait, let's call her up and make sure she's going to be there.  Can we get her number real quick?  Yeah.  Yeah, call her.  Oh, he's looking at it the way he's looking.  Just call her on your phone.  Does she get a boyfriend?  No, call her on your phone and put it on speaker.  Go ahead again.  Fucking question, Jimmy.  Who's your boyfriend?  She doesn't have a boyfriend.  Let me see. 
[01:38:30]  Where is she in a relationship with?  How old is she?  How old a gal is she?  Single.  Ooh.  Right there.  She's 18 or 19?  She's a hip-hop fan.  It says religious views, young money, and it says political views.  Wheezy for president.  Ah, boy.  Wheezy for president.  Ah, boy.  That could be bad for Aunt Good for me.  Has she been infected?  Has she been infected?  You can ignore her and I'll just watch her fucking...  Oh, man.  Wow, what a dirty girl.  I think Aunt's going to this pool party. 
[01:39:00]  Call her up on your phone.  If I was a betting man, I think...  I'm going to get in shape.  I think Aunt might be doing some Google mapping.  You already are in shape.  Maybe.  Yeah, I'm going to wear a singlet like those weightlifters in 1905.  I'm going to be like the colonel.  Call her up.  Yeah, so he's got quite a cunt on you.  May I see it, please?  May I see it, please?  Speaker phone.  Tell her she's on the air first before you go to speaker phone.  Of course.  True.  It's a gal you're on the radio.  Is he trying to make believe he's calling her?  I see.  I'm watching.  Give me the gal.  Okay, you are watching.  All right. 
[01:39:30]  Here we go.  Don't put her on speaker yet.  You've got to say, hey, could you go in the air with Opie and Anthony for a second?  They'll be very nice.  Yeah, yeah.  We just want to talk about the party.  We're very nice guys.  And the tits.  Mention them.  Well, don't mention those.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  I'm a little nervous with that fucking young money and wheezy for prison.  Nah, it's fine.  It's just young.  It's pop culture.  Yeah, a lot of young white girls like hip-hop.  It's pop culture.  Yeah, but she's a white girl.  Rob's a little virus.  We won't blow it.  I've noticed the thing I have in common with girls. 
[01:40:00]  Is there a machine picking up?  That age or our mutual hatred of foreign people.  Let me know when a machine picks up.  I'll leave a message for her.  People of different races and nationality.  She's not really calling her.  Fake it.  I can share in our hate.  Oh, no.  What?  Jim should leave her a message.  Yeah.  No.  Does it sound like a good message?  No.  Is it a fun message?  Or is it just...  It's just a message.  Hi, Nicole.  This is Jim Norton. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  The Jim Norton.  And we're on the air with Rob and Opie and Anthony and Sam.  And we were...  Rob's birthday is coming up.  And he told us that you would be possibly attending his party.  So we wanted to make sure that he was indeed going to have girls who fuck going to the party.  No one's following that. 
[01:41:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  We're not doing it.  No, no.  We're good.  We're good.  No.  No.  Chip trying to go to break already.  We got it.  No.  We got to stay here for a while.  Holy shit.  Oh, is that fucking funny?  She's going to be listening like, okay, yeah, it's a regular message.  What?  She better call the fuck.  All right, show us another one.  She's very pretty.  That was a good one, man.  Good fucking job.  You're one for one.  You're one for one. 
[01:41:30]  God damn.  This pool party is shaping up.  Wow, she's pretty.  I like that, but you can't have all the fucking bunch of guys with their dicks out chasing  one girl around.  I know.  She can't show up with a guy friend either.  Oh, God.  Oh, hi.  This is a wheezy Jamal that I'm seeing.  Oh, God.  Some guy with fucking thug cats on his abs.  Oh, but I hate that.  Yeah.  Jesus.  This is the second girl?  Yeah.  Cool.  Where does she live?  In Sixth Town?  Rob, there's a bit of a drop off.  No, go back, Sam. 
[01:42:00]  She's got a bit of a drop off.  She's cute, though.  She's got a shit.  I would have started with her, and then you go with the clothes.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  You fucked up the order of the girls.  I'm not.  She's the one on the right.  She has some good Instagram pictures.  She's got good posture.  Who's the retard in the pirate hat?  Don't invite her.  That ain't bad.  She'll just show up.  She'll start just eating fucking plastic.  Then she's posed next to Star Wars characters with a blaster.  Exactly.  Yay, pirate.  All right, dope.  All right.  All right.  Yay, I hope they're coming. 
[01:42:30]  Are they coming?  No.  They got swimmies for them.  All right.  Let's see another one.  Here's the third one.  All right.  She kind of has a boyfriend.  She has a boyfriend.  Fucked up.  Who are these ones?  That's a big-titted animal.  Who's the loopy fat one on the right?  I like her.  And who's this one on the left?  Farhead McGillicuddy.  I like her, too.  Exactly.  Hey, what'd this one do?  Is that the one right there?  She's actually cute.  Which one?  In the middle?  The one on the left.  She looks like she's got on a spaceship.  Yeah. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, God.  What is that?  Boom.  Metallica's bassist and some other guy.  Yeah, really?  All right.  Wow.  She loves pushing her boobs for her.  Yeah.  Who's that fucking monster in the middle?  Kind of looks a little bit like Kate Middleton, I would say.  Kaz Elliott in the middle.  Yeah.  I'm going to invite her.  I'm going to invite her also.  Oh, man.  When they get confirmation emails, let me know.  I can invite anybody.  Yeah, exactly.  I can invite Prince Harry.  What about the pig in the middle?  She's nice.  She got a ribcage tat, that girl?  Yeah.  Nice.  What does it say?  I'm not entirely sure. 
[01:43:30]  White's not welcome.  I think it's a Tupac reference.  Oh, fucking A with your girls.  They're all lovers.  I'll go back, go back.  All right.  Now, tell me that you're not fucking inviting that girl on the left.  The monster.  Yeah.  Because she's the gregarious fat girl.  She's the type that would put on that funny pirate hat and go,  and run into the pool just so we laugh with her and not at her.  You'd think she does a lot.  Big fat one piece.  Oh, is that her? 
[01:44:00]  Look at her right in the middle there.  Oh, man.  Look at the one all the way to the right.  She looks like the fat chick from fucking Bosom Buddies.  It's Wendy Jo Sperber.  Sperber.  Right there.  Yeah.  Invite her in the kimono.  Tell her I want to stick it with a duty.  Give us another one.  Give us another chick.  All right.  Well, that girl who I said I was going to invite is right.  Why don't you call one of these fucking chicks?  Let's get them on the line here.  Get them on the horn.  Oh, man.  Yeah, she's cute.  Oh, man.  I like that.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, yeah.  Look at her legs.  Look at those legs.  What the fuck? 
[01:44:30]  Walk over my face in a skirt.  She's pretty.  Come on.  What the hell are these artistic bullshit pictures?  Go back.  Go back.  Let me see her pensive glance at the city.  I know.  I'd like to fire a pebble at her from back here.  This lonely girl thinks it over.  I hope right now she's looking at the city.  She's thinking, oh, narts.  I got my period.  I have no tampon.  That's what she's thinking.  Oh, narts.  Oh, narts.  What a terrible artistic fucking picture.  Oh, go back.  Let me see that one.  Have you ever banged her? 
[01:45:00]  Which one?  The one with the round nose right in front.  That one?  What the fuck?  Where do these two meet?  Are they at the fucking funny nose store?  Holy shit.  What a kid at the funny nose store.  I don't know.  They both got groucho glasses and cut their mustaches out.  Enough with these chicks.  Yours is crazier.  No, mine is crazier.  Oh, my God.  No, are you banging one of them?  I apologize.  No, you're a good kid.  Oh, man.  Let me see.  She looks like Amy Schumer in that picture.  That's pretty hot right there.  Yeah.  The one on the right is.  Yeah.  The one on the left and the fucking little leg fucking hugging. 
[01:45:30]  And she has high heels on, too.  Yeah, and a giant head.  Oh, boy.  I kind of like that one.  Yeah.  I don't think that's her.  Who's that one?  Who's her friend?  Invite her, too.  I kind of like that little fucking costume.  Well, you see the lips are off to the side.  Yeah, it's kind of a cool costume.  It's the duality of her.  Boring and dull.  I like that.  I like to fuck both of her mouths.  The real one and then the side one.  I'll just drill through her cheek.  Like that, you smart aleck.  Smart aleck. 
[01:46:00]  Holy fuck, man.  You're still friends with a girl that you shoved your fingers up her butt, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you should invite her to the party.  Oh, man, that's hot right there.  Exactly.  Remember, he said fingers.  Yeah, look at that.  Fingers.  Fingers.  Oh, man.  So you're going to invite her to the party?  I'll invite her.  I need some fucking girl friends.  Oh, man.  In South Jersey.  I don't have any friends like this.  That's hot.  Why would you come up from South Jersey for your pool party?  Too much eye makeup.  It's great.  Trying so hard to be big girls.  Trying so hard with their dumb eye makeup.  I love that.  I want to look like an adult. 
[01:46:30]  Yay.  Oh, boy.  Who's this?  Who's fucking...  Who's Julian gives good head and dead from less than zero?  Enough with him.  Enough with his fucking big juicy lips.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you fuck.  What else is going to happen at this pool party?  What else?  Come on.  What else is going to happen?  Looks like you could deliver on the girls.  Maybe you can deliver on the girls.  I think he can, to be honest with you.  You got to be there.  Your parents going to be there?  Maybe.  I don't know. 
[01:47:00]  It's up in the air.  Oh, they're going to be there.  They're going to be up in the air?  How is it up in the air?  Because...  I don't know.  They'll probably, like, come in...  They don't want a risky business fucking situation going on.  My brother's moving that day.  What?  So there's going to be, like, furniture going in and out of the house?  No, no, no.  Not from my house.  That shit, what?  Oh.  From his house.  Yeah.  To...  How does that affect us?  Doesn't at all.  All right.  I'm saying my parents are probably going to be helping him.  Why?  Because he needs help.  You guys are rich.  Why don't I just get a mover?  Let's take over this house. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Let's, like, just take over.  Risky business.  Troy Kwan used to throw ridiculous parties in Eric Nagel's house.  I think Troy can...  Is that true, Eric?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He got blown in his parents' bathroom.  Yep.  Wow.  By Eric's mom.  Oh, shit.  Sorry, Eric.  Oh, man.  That's not cool.  All over the invitation.  Oh, you spilled your coffee.  I spilled my coffee.  Fucking bitch. 
[01:48:00]  Eric said, that's not cool.  That's not cool.  I didn't mean it, dude.  I don't care if she's sucking dick at a party.  Oh, man.  That's not good, either.  Troy Kwan used to...  Please.  Yeah, like finger bang girls that were underage or something.  I heard that.  It was on the after show, I think.  Well, you didn't mean to say that on the air.  Eric just whispered it loudly into a microphone.  The girls, I don't know if I should say this on the air, but I think they were underage.  And that's exactly what it sounded like on air.  Troy got so pissed.  Troy was like, hey, dick, it went out over the air. 
[01:48:30]  So Troy should be invited to this party, Rob.  Oh, Troy...  No!  See, you guys are dumb.  I agree.  No.  I agree.  Keep that fucking ladies man out of there.  If Ant says for you to ban Troy Kwan, will you ban him?  Troy Kwan is banned.  Invite people like E-Rock.  E-Rock's...  Exactly.  Why do you say that?  Well, figure it out.  Just guys that will knock on water out of the pool, so the girls will have to come  in the fucking bedroom and hang out. 
[01:49:00]  I want a girl in the...  Did she call you back at that chick?  She probably wants to fucking talk to me.  Yeah, why hasn't she called back yet?  Yeah, what's this bitch doing?  Text her.  Text the bitch.  3.30 in the morning?  Exactly.  What does she do for a living?  She's going to be like, what is this bitch?  Yeah, what does she do?  She works at a deli.  Oh, God.  She's a fucking deli worker?  A Jersey deli worker.  Right now her fucking hand is being held up while a severed finger hangs by a tendon.  Two of her pretty girl fingers are fucking caught in a pimento loaf. 
[01:49:30]  A deli worker.  If she should fuck me on...  Fucking Manny.  A Manny she saved up for for two weeks.  Just fucking dangling from some bologna.  Yeah, exactly.  Because some guy was trying to flirt with her while she made his fucking olive loaf sandwich.  Hey, honey, you ought to be a model.  Or her big fucking...  Her big nose friend walked in.  And she thought it was Mr. Dithers from the Blondie cartoon. 
[01:50:00]  Aren't you Dagwood Bumstead's boss?  With that schnozzola?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, I want that nose poking my belly button.  What were those girls saying in that picture?  They were doing dueling.  Ha-cha-cha-cha.  A dink, a dink-a-doo.  I'm going to the party, dink-a-doo.  Oh, Jesus.  Duranty don't eat no ass. 
[01:50:30]  I'm sorry.  Sounds like a riot, though, this party so far.  We've got to get the girl to call back before you make your decision.  That is true.  I want to know if these girls are goers.  Does your decision on whether or not to go hinge upon whether or not Troy is going?  No.  No, it'll just make it a little tougher, but I've got to dive in.  But maybe Troy can pump up the party a little bit.  Maybe he can bring some bitches.  Maybe he'll bring some bitches.  Is it P-Y-O-B?  Oh, yeah.  Bring your own bitches, I mean.  Bring your own bitches. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Aren't you too old for pool parties at your parents' house?  No.  That's a great question.  That's a good question, right?  Very good question.  Do you know how bad I want to bring a couple of tranny shoes?  That'd be great.  Do you want to horrify his parents?  Oh, my God.  Running around.  Hi!  Fucking cocks all bobbling.  His neighbors complaining.  Did you think that there's a possibility that this could go horribly wrong?  Yeah.  Did you not understand that we could just fucking put this out there? 
[01:51:30]  I did, but I figured I'd trust you guys.  No risk, no reward.  Dumbest thing ever.  Watch what I do now.  Where's my invite?  Can I give out the address?  No, please don't.  You don't want to invite the listeners?  They're our friends, too.  Oh, man.  That always goes well.  Sure.  Sounds fun.  Girls, booze.  You can have chips?  Chips.  Fat. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, what kind of food are we talking?  Well, I don't know.  Oh, boy.  You getting pizza and sandwiches?  You don't have this plan there in it?  Pizza?  Sandwich?  No, I don't think pizza.  What kind of snacks?  Let's get some pizza.  Pizza?  What about some fucking shit for the grill, yo?  Of course.  Oh, okay.  Who's grilling?  I don't know.  What kind of snacks?  I mean, we're a week and a half out.  Probably grill.  Yeah, it's a week and a half.  Is mommy going to make homemade baked goods?  She may.  Yes.  Some more of those, what are they called?  Magic cookies?  Magic cookie bars.  Is this a Saturday? 
[01:52:30]  Magic cookie bars?  Not this Saturday.  No, but it's a Saturday.  Magic cookie bars.  Okay, so I don't know if I'm around or not.  I like to swim in the nude.  Is that a problem?  Would they have a problem with that?  If I swim in the nude?  I think there would be a little problem.  What kind of snacks are you going to have there?  Well, my mom makes a mean pasta salad.  Oh, delicious.  Oh, no, it's delicious.  I don't know.  Chips with fassels.  Oh, boy.  Is Jess invited?  Cookies.  Jess is invited. 
[01:53:00]  Everyone gets to bring.  What makes your mom's pasta salad mean?  Exactly.  You need to know.  A mean pasta salad.  What's mean about it?  What's mean about it?  What makes it so mean?  Look out.  It's got a little zest.  Look out.  What's in it?  I don't know.  She didn't tell me.  I just eat it.  Is the lovely Mrs. Roberts going?  Jess Roberts?  I guess so, but the only problem is I don't know if she has a bathing suit.  Oh, man.  You know?  I don't know.  Maybe she could join me nude in the pool. 
[01:53:30]  Would that bother you if her and Anthony were frolicking nude?  I could get nude in the pool.  Why?  Plenty of bathing suits, and I don't even know if she'd feel comfortable in a bathing suit  around you animals.  What?  Don't start saying she's better than any of us.  Exactly.  Wait till I pop a Cialis and go to Rob's house.  Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Intern.  Yeah, we don't even know his last name.  Oh, fuck.  Why is the pasta salad good?  Yeah, exactly.  I need to know.  What makes it zesty?  I don't know.  She adds little spices and stuff to it. 
[01:54:00]  It's good.  It's delicious.  Oh, I know the recipe.  Did she make you...  I don't be eating that.  No.  Did she make your lunch for school every day?  She did.  Throw it up.  Did your mom make yours?  No.  Oh.  Did your mom make a bean pasta salad?  No.  I told you, we got the peanut butter and jelly on the Peppers Farm thin bread.  Oh, God.  The worst bread ever.  And my mom would get the bruised apples because they were cheaper, and that was our lunch.  So she sort of made that, I guess.  I mean, she put it together.  Did you have the lunch bags that were made for the lunches? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, like the little paper bags.  Oh, yeah.  Out of the brown bag bags.  I got over to go with old cement bags that actually had cement in them at one point.  You know, some people don't believe it.  A little dusty.  We would use whatever bags were in the house.  Yeah.  And it would be the big, giant, wall-bound bags.  Oh, my God.  Those are the worst.  But we had to fold them because, you know, it was too giant.  It was embarrassing.  And then one day, the bag supply ran low, and yes, we did use some sort of cement bag thing. 
[01:55:00]  Good question.  Will there be any Entenmann's snacks?  Oh, we love Entenmann's.  I love Entenmann's.  Original crumb cake, right?  Entenmann's.  Not the...  And the chocolate doughnuts.  I like both forms.  I like the new fangled crumb cake with chocolate in it.  And I like the original crumb cake, and sometimes I'll just ask, like, I won't even know what  kind I'm getting, but I'll just say something, like, if your mom is there, I'll, like, she'll 
[01:55:30]  be up there, and I'll put my feet up, and I'll be like, bitch, bring me a piece of crumb  cake.  Fuck it, Jimmy.  Entenmann's.  Yeah, we need some Entenmann's.  Entenmann's.  Entenmann's.  Okay.  And we also need more magic cookie bars.  I forgot to bring some home.  That's fine.  And I need some of those chocolate chip cookies.  Roofies.  Yeah, so make sure you have that by the next time you're interning, please.  Are they good, the magic cookie bars?  You weren't here for the magic cookie bars?  I was probably out fucking earning. 
[01:56:00]  No.  Oh, man.  His mom, and it even turned in, because we had that Chippahoy discussion.  What's that?  Yep, we finally did.  When Jimmy wasn't here, we were able to talk about it.  We were able to actually talk about it.  Chippahoy cookies.  What's that?  And even Ed said these homemade cookies with chocolate things in them were pretty damn good.  Yeah.  Right, Ant?  Not too shabby.  It might have been the best, that type of cookie I've ever eaten.  I just loved how much Anthony hated homemade cookies.  It was so unreasonable. 
[01:56:30]  I know.  Thank you.  I do get unreasonable.  It makes me laugh, though.  I get so angry.  I hate homemade apple pie.  Like, what else do you hate?  The Lord and babies?  But those cookies, they don't look homemade.  No, they looked like they came from the store.  Every single one was the exact same size.  Yeah.  Ugh, gosh.  Use a little ice cream scooper.  Right.  So it's magic.  Not with the hands.  That's a good idea. 
[01:57:00]  Hey, hey.  Let me tell you about ice cream in my house.  Oh.  Oh, and kind of good, right?  I'm one of seven kids, and it was time to go to Friendly's and get ice cream.  Yay!  We had to get a half gallon of maple walnut for my mom, and then the rest of us split  a half gallon of whatever we wanted.  Oh, wow.  How many of you were there?  There were seven other people.  Oh, my God.  Wait, why did she get maple?  Could you have had some of her maple walnut?  Yeah.  But who wants that shit?  I had to develop a liking for maple walnut ice cream. 
[01:57:30]  Do you like it now?  Yeah, it's all right.  Actually, I can't really.  I didn't like it at the time.  You know, that kind of reminds me, though.  Moms would do shit like that, because I used to build up a fucking taste for, like, diet  cream soda and shit.  There you go.  Yeah.  And it's like, ah, this sucks.  But she would buy us soda, but we would drink it, like, too fast.  No, but my point is 50% of the ice cream consumption in our house had to be her flavor.  Right.  Always.  Always.  I used to get mad, though, and do that.  And then for chocolates, we'd have to eat the AIDS diet plan. 
[01:58:00]  My mom had AIDS.  It was the chocolate AIDS.  No one believed you.  A-Y-D-S.  You've got to be really old to remember that one.  AIDS.  Like, really old.  It's the greatest awful product name in history.  I lost weight with AIDS.  Can we play that commercial again?  It's the best ever.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go anyplace.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6.  AIDS helps control your appetite so you lose weight, yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy. 
[01:58:30]  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant.  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous.  Question.  Why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  Now, for the people that don't know, that's a real commercial from, what, the 70s?  Yeah.  And it was called, it was spelled A-Y-D-S.  A-Y-D-S.  And it was chocolates.  And you'd eat them and it would, like, fuck up your appetite. 
[01:59:00]  Man.  Yeah, yeah.  AIDS.  They changed.  They had to.  They had to change it.  What did they become?  They were done.  It didn't become.  Lymphoma.  That's great.  But could you imagine, like, you have the thing and it's starting to sell, and then you  hear, like, the phone, the one guy called the other one, like, you know that thing that's  been killing all the gays?  Yeah.  You're not going to guess what they're calling it.  They're calling it.  You're shitting me.  You're shitting me.  Oh, man. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  That was a biggie for AIDS.  Wow.  Did that chocolate taste good?  No, it was terrible.  But it was something.  We got tricked by the cooking chocolate from time to time.  Yeah.  Oh, that's the worst.  Oh, my God.  It looks so delicious.  And it's just bitter.  Horrible.  There was so many things.  Like, man, we'd buy these terrible things.  Diet stuff.  All this diet shit in the house.  And matzahs.  You'd think we were Jewish.  Matzahs?  She'd buy matzahs for snacking on.  And then we used to fucking just put a shitload of butter on them. 
[02:00:00]  And then turn the stove on and turn them upside down over the stove for a couple of seconds  to melt it.  And flip it back over.  Melted butter on a matzah.  Great.  I'll tell you one thing.  A fucking crispy matzah would go well right now.  You like a matzah?  A good crispy matzah.  You like a good matzah?  A fucking little piece of butter on a crispy matzah would go right down the pipe right  now.  Yeah.  All right.  We got breaking news from Bill Burr.  Sorry, but this is too good.  Because he called from that airport in the middle of nowhere. 
[02:00:30]  Fucking plane was leaking gas.  We all had to get out.  Never fly to a small city.  Fly to the closest major city and drive the rest of the way.  Yeah.  A cities equals A team.  You fly to a B or C level city and the pilot is a feature act from Syracuse.  They are currently troubleshooting.  Then he sends me a picture.  There's a fire engine.  Well, this is his caption to the picture.  Fire engine just in case the flop sweat under the plane catches fire.  Fuck!  That's what he's flying to. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Look at this.  Wow.  That's fucked up.  Fucking.  Ah, that's fucked.  Fire truck right behind the plane.  I, uh, is that a jet though?  It looks like a jet.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yes.  What airline?  I can't tell.  What color is the?  The, the, the, the back wing there has like red, red stripe, stripes.  Well, he's not flying.  It's not Air Canada.  Is that a Southwest type of thing?  Don't know.  I know it's not Air Canada and it's not Qantas.  And they both have, I believe, red.  I wouldn't think a Qantas would be in fucking East Dipshit, wherever he was. 
[02:01:30]  Nor were there.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Meow.  Oh, wait.  We got another, uh.  An update?  Yeah.  It's the mass accumulation of these travel situations that will eventually lead me to  accept a position as co-host on a cooking show with a sassy soccer player.  Hilarious.  I'm getting a private show from Bill Burr.  Yeah.  That I'm passing along to you.  A text show.  I passed the savings on to you.  So, he's, um.  And then Kenny writes, the Trump Hotel has a 23,000 square foot spa and state-of-the-art 
[02:02:00]  health club with a heated indoor lab pool.  Wow.  Very nice.  They asked him if I could work out in Chicago.  Very nice, uh, hotel that we're paying full price for.  And then my wife's calling me meditator boy.  Because I went to a meditation class last night.  For how long?  How was that?  It was weird.  Saw some shit, man.  Some, like, fucking ghostly images coming at me.  What?  Weird shit.  It can't be.  Globs of stuff. 
[02:02:30]  That's just shit in your eye.  They're floaters, they're called.  I don't know.  Globs of stuff.  You got floaters.  Is there a guy standing in front of you when you're fucking kidding?  You're right.  Globs of stuff.  And I, my whole right leg, uh, fell asleep from my knee down and I didn't notice.  That's how deep I was, I guess.  I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck this all means.  Would you have an eye beam over it?  Let's see, because that would make you go to sleep.  What the hell am I saying?  No, it was funny.  There's no setup for that or anything.  What ruined it for me, though, this is why I didn't, because it was a funny line, was 
[02:03:00]  I'm looking right at it and he's just jostling the cup almost like a timing thing.  Was there an eye beam over it?  Uh, it did, yeah.  Like, we all do that weird stuff.  I know.  I got my hand on my hip.  I'm leaning back on my chair like fucking Carl Casual here.  Yeah, that's for a dick.  I'm a dick bag.  Holy fucking shit.  I mean, talking about meditation is pretty whatever, but last night there was a massive  car accident right outside the window as we're meditating.  And I'm sitting there going, really?  No one's going to acknowledge what we just all heard? 
[02:03:30]  Well, it sounded horrific like someone had to have died.  Really?  And then I got out of the class and there's a...  It was basically that sound effect.  And I get out of meditation and there's a guy just sitting in his completely mangled car  waiting for a tow truck.  He was fine.  He was sitting in his car?  But an hour later, he's still just hanging out.  The car was completely totaled.  I don't even know what he hit.  Did it ruin your fucking, uh, your mood?  Well, what do you think? 
[02:04:00]  I'm like, really?  I get this meditation thing where you're supposed to block out shit, but we're going to all  make believe we didn't hear a horrific car accident outside the window?  Maybe everybody really was doing well at it.  What time was your meditation?  Did you go at night?  I can't say.  What?  That would be funny.  I can't say.  I just thought it'd be funny.  Jimmy, you got to go.  Go with me next Monday.  Dude, I'm a bad meditator.  I wish I could.  No one's a good meditator.  But I mean, I'm terrible with just shutting my mind off. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, I can never do it.  And I'm always thinking.  It's going a mile a minute.  When your mind is doing what your mind's supposed to do, by the way, don't get frustrated or  distracted.  Oh, no.  Just bring it back to your breath.  What?  I'm talking to the meditators out there.  What does that mean?  It means your mind is supposed to wander and be crazy and be, uh...  Right.  Because people get frustrated because all of a sudden they get thoughts and you're like,  no, that's your mind doing what it's supposed to do.  But what you're supposed to do is then bring it back to the breath and focus on the breath.  Are you supposed to think, breath, breath, breath? 
[02:05:00]  What, like you're supposed to breathe and just go like, yeah, okay.  Well, then just be aware of your breath.  Are you aware of your breathing right now?  No.  Of course not.  No.  Now be aware of it.  I don't want to be.  Ah!  No, my mind's always going.  It's always fucking racing along with some fucking thoughts.  There were some weird, like, souls floating around or something last night.  I can't even describe it.  I went home and tried to describe it and I realized there's really no words and it's 
[02:05:30]  something I'd never really experienced before.  It was fucking weird.  I got to talk to Rogan, man.  What?  I got to get some lollipops from Rogan.  Yeah.  No, get some taffies from Rogan.  Taffies.  I don't know.  This is boring shit.  But the fact is, there was a car accident and everyone just sat there like, yeah, we're  not going to acknowledge that.  Oh, okay.  How about we run out because maybe someone's burning alive right now.  Maybe they're counting on us.  Were you doing ohms?  Oh, yeah, we were doing ohms.  That's silly. 
[02:06:00]  And monstrous.  Everybody's asking, by the way, I tweeted a picture of Rogan, just the front picture.  Everybody's asking why there are sperms on the front of this.  I thought it was sperm, too.  Happy little sperm.  Yeah, what are they?  Sperm parties.  Balloons.  I love smiley faces.  Happy smiley face.  Are we allowed to piss and shit in the pool?  Just piss.  I mean, I piss in my pool.  Oh, god damn it.  I hate to see his webbed toes.  He's zipping around.  Oh, god.  He's like a munger pose.  Lap two, lap three, lap four, lap five.  Rogan.  Has your mom ever thrown herself down the stairs to get a little attention? 
[02:06:30]  And then start screaming, now you don't have to worry about me anymore?  Oh, no.  No way.  No.  No way.  I was just wondering.  She hasn't.  I was just wondering.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I was just wondering.  Now you don't have to worry about me anymore?  I was just wondering if that ever happened at your house.  No way.  Because you were the problem.  Wait, let me ask you.  If someone did that.  Because you were the problem.  Would they do it before?  Would they yell that before they threw themselves down the stairs?  Oh, no.  After the fact.  But why if they lived?  I don't know.  Oh, god.  Would everybody go and rescue the person? 
[02:07:00]  What do you think?  They would all rush to the person's room.  What do you think?  Oh, are you okay?  And then, you know, as the person was being dragged out of the house, there might have been  a, now you don't have to worry about me anymore.  Oh, wow.  Did that ever happen, Rob?  No.  Rob, comment.  Who was dragging them out of the house?  Hey, it could be anyone from enablers to, you know, the paramedics.  Oh, wow.  That's a scene.  Depending on which one.  That's a scene.  Which time, I mean.  I hate a scene. 
[02:07:30]  That never happened, huh?  No, unfortunately not.  I mean, fortunately not.  Yeah, fortunately.  You got that wrong.  No, you should say unfortunately.  It's a real treat for everybody.  I bet.  It's enjoyment.  Wow.  That stays with you.  That's brutal.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no sorries.  I'm good.  I'm good.  All right, so we got this party.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  You should come.  I want to make sure, you know, it's going to be fun. 
[02:08:00]  Can we take a break and do the Dr. Drew shit?  Fuck it, Amy, Ken.  Wait, wait.  And we got Russell Peters coming in.  He's coming in.  He just checked in.  Oh, good.  So he'll do the Dr. Drew shit with us.  That's right.  I got to think of a better way to throw a break.  New chip videos on YouTube.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  That's what I wanted to promote.  Yes.  It's hilarious.  Part three, Chip with a mustache now, is on YouTube.com slash chiptvshow.  And hopefully, if somebody is doing their job, on the Opie and Anthony Facebook page. 
[02:08:30]  I did watch it last night.  I saw it and I laughed.  I can laugh watching Chip because I really do distance myself from it.  I don't feel like I'm watching myself.  It's so funny when you're doing them live, though, because Jim always thinks that he hasn't done enough or he always thinks it's not funny.  Oh, dude.  I literally will say to Sam, like, this stinks.  It's like, I don't have anything funny.  It doesn't feel.  It's hilarious.  But watching, I can see how ridiculous it is.  The mustache is hilarious.  I didn't realize how ridiculous the mustache was when we played the audio on the show.  In the last part, part four, there's a scene that I almost had to cut out because the camera work is not good because you can see the screen shaking because I'm trying to contain a laugh. 
[02:09:00]  I think it was you just staring at a guy in confusion as you asked him what his costume was and he described what the character meant.  And you just started staring at him.  And then once he finished, after like 20 full seconds of talking, you were just like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Leave it in.  I did.  I left it in. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  We got to work on this whole break thing to make it cool.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, God.  I can't do it now.  Break it.  No.  What do you think of Rob's shirt?  Fucking yellow lettuce.  Why are you wearing that shirt?  I don't know.  It was a dollar, so.  Grandma's country corner.  You don't think Opie might be jealous of the color of the shirt, Chip?  Oh, yeah.  Fucking yellow and green.  What is it going to make blue or something? 
[02:10:00]  You're probably sad.  Oh, man.  The shirt, the color.  Rob, you want to know about my grandma?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, sure.  Last time I saw her, where I told my mom I'll be waiting in the car.  You might want to look up that story.  That's a cute one, too.  When she called me precious when I was 20-whatever years old at the time.  My precious.  After she blew off the family for over 10 years.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You don't have a cute little grandma shirt?  The last memory she has of me is seeing the back of my head as I'm leaving her hospital room. 
[02:10:30]  As she's dying.  As she's dying.  I'm sorry.  Fuck her.  Grandma's country corner.  Yeah, why that, though?  What does the back say?  I think where it is.  It's like a little place in Pennsylvania.  Yeah, why'd she have her trees on a corner?  What a fucking, like...  That's nice language.  She had the, like, investigated dead people, right? 
[02:11:00]  The corner.  No, that's corner.  A corner's a person who deals with death.  A corner is a place, like a left and a right meeting together.  Hit the brake button, piggy boy.  This is the OPN3 Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The OPN3 Show. 
[02:11:30]  Want to say hi to Russell Peters in studio?  Hello, fellas.  It's been a while, Russell.  It has been a minute, hasn't it?  You smell very good.  Well, thanks, Jimmy.  Your cologne is very good.  That means we all have to buy your cologne.  I have a really fucking gay secret about my cologne, dude.  Oh, it's a woman's perfume?  You son of a bitch.  Is that itch?  It's true.  Yeah.  Is that true, Larry?  But I'll tell you how it happened.  I always used to buy this one brand, and then I was at the airport, and I was like, shit. 
[02:12:00]  This was like maybe five years ago.  I was at the airport, and I go, oh, I need another one.  So I just grabbed it.  And the women's one was packaged exactly the same as the men's.  Oh, and then I opened it, and the bottle was exactly the same, but the color of the fluid  was a lighter color.  Yeah.  And I go, oh, it must be like a summer version.  That's what I thought.  And I go, because it was like May.  I was like, oh, this must be the summer fragrance.  And I was like, fucking, it's great.  And then I noticed after it said femme in French. 
[02:12:30]  Femme.  You fucking femme.  I felt like such a femme, but I've been wearing it for the past five years.  What does it smell like, Jimmy?  I don't, like, it's floral, but it's not.  Vaginas and tampons.  It just smells like a good fresh soap, right?  Yeah, it is.  It's very, um.  Gives you a rod.  It's clean.  Yeah, it's very, very clean.  And I will admit, ironically, I am wearing a woman's perfume as well.  Oh!  What the fuck is going on? 
[02:13:00]  Is that your thing?  No, it was one that I loved, and I didn't realize it was a perfume until we got to the  store.  Kenny's dying over there.  Kenny knows what I'm talking about.  And it was good, though, so I bought it.  Which one?  Are you wearing it right now?  Mm-hmm.  What does it smell like?  D.L. Hughley.  What?  It was one of his.  Oh, I thought you meant it smelled like D.L. Hughley.  Yeah, right?  D.L. always smells.  He's the best smelling comic in the business.  And he wears a woman's fucking fragrance?  Just one of his.  Yeah, it was like.  No, but we got the other one from him.  That's Black Afgano. 
[02:13:30]  Afgano?  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  I wore that yesterday.  Yeah.  We got that because of D.L. Hughley.  We smell somebody, and then we go out and get it.  D.L. smells great every time he comes in.  That's me and Jimmy's thing.  He's always dressed fucking impeccably.  It's disgusting.  Like, I was watching him on The View, and I go, Jesus, how do you put an outfit together  that detailed?  Yeah.  You gotta be black, first of all.  I'll do a V-neck and a jacket and, you know, nice shoes and jeans, and, you know, but I'm  like, it looks good.  I'll put a little napkin in the pocket square.  It's effortless. 
[02:14:00]  It's a black thing.  Yeah, I think so, too.  For some reason, they just know how to do that.  He just looks good in good clothes.  Well, it's not even that.  It just always looks perfectly pressed.  Like, it's like.  Not a wrinkle.  It's almost like he walks stiff.  Right.  Yes, Kenny.  When Jim is on the road, he's happiest when he's cologne shopping.  Is that a little tidbit of Jimmy knowledge?  Yes, it is.  What else makes him happy on the road, Kenny?  I need to know now.  Massages?  Mm-hmm.  Massages.  Legit?  Or? 
[02:14:30]  From me.  Ah, come on.  Oh, boy.  You all right, Jimmy?  No, I just like the uncomfortable silence after he geared up to hit a home run.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He pulled his back out around three times.  He fouled it off his fucking shin.  Massages.  And then there was the perfect ebb and flow.  From me.  From me. 
[02:15:00]  I love Kenny.  And Russell, by the way, is promoting.  I've got to plug his gigs because he's promoting gigs up.  November 10th, November 18th, and December 7th.  You can go to RussellPeters.com for details.  In Brooklyn, here in New York, the Barclays Center, which is on sale now.  What?  You're playing the Barclays?  Can we stop there for a second?  Are you the first comic playing it?  I'm the first comic playing it.  Oh, you are?  Holy shit.  And I'm the fourth artist in.  It's like Jay-Z, Madonna, Eagles, and then me.  Come on.  Damn.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  We're trying to make some history there. 
[02:15:30]  That's phenomenal, dude.  That's pretty goddamn good.  Yeah, that's where the Nets are going to play.  Maybe Anthony will come out this time.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Probably not.  Probably not.  I retreat to my house like a fucking, what was that movie?  Goddamn I Am Legend.  Right.  That night.  Shouting down the hatches.  But I want to give Russell a compliment.  I don't know if I've done it in front of you, but watching you perform for the world  is crazy.  It's pretty fun.  It's weird, though, because he's got humor that part, you know, people from all, I can't 
[02:16:00]  really explain myself, I guess.  It's very specific.  Oh, it was the Radio City Music Hall.  You were doing a great job.  I know.  I'm sorry.  But all of a sudden he would like do, I don't know, Indian humor or whatever.  And the pockets of Indian people like, oh, I know exactly what he's talking about.  Then he would move on to the French or something.  It was just crazy.  Worldwide.  Worldwide shit.  But everyone enjoys it, even if you don't understand, you know, the concept.  Yeah, it's about breaking it down.  It's about making it accessible.  Yeah, I don't know.  November 18th. 
[02:16:30]  I'm babbling.  I'm wheelchair accessible.  No, I'm babbling like an idiot.  You're a comedy ramp.  Yeah, I'm a comedy ramp.  Yeah, I'm a comedy ramp.  I'm a comedy short bus.  The HP Pavilion in San Jose, California.  Yeah.  I don't know how big that gig is, but I'm going to tell you something.  Pavilion is never a small gig.  Never.  That's where they have UFCs.  When they have them in San Jose, that's where they are.  Oh, okay.  Because those are usually in 200 seaters.  It's a massive room.  Oh, and another place that I was going to play, but I threw my back out, was Friday,  December 7th.  Russell will be at the Staples Center. 
[02:17:00]  Oh.  That's where you want to do comedy, where fucking Kobe Bryant works.  That's a lot of fucking people, man.  How many seats there?  Probably, what, about somewhere from 16 to 18, I think.  Oh.  And I just gave him.  If that was 100, I would go.  Very impressive.  Yeah.  That's 1,000.  And I just gave him the worst compliment ever.  Well, it was a good compliment.  It was a horrendous compliment.  You know, I could tell where your heart was.  I panicked in the middle of it, and then I couldn't find my way out of it.  Are you watching the Olympics, Russell?  I have, you know, just the highlights. 
[02:17:30]  I'm a big fan of the highlights.  I can't find the fucking boxing anywhere.  Oh, the boxing is on CNBC, I believe.  Separate channel?  Not that primetime fucking real NBC channel?  Yeah.  Because they kind of threw soccer on something, on the channel.  You've got NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, and then that NBC Sports Network.  Yeah.  There's no specifics.  It just says 2012 Summer Olympics.  Yeah.  There's not like...  Yeah, like, tell us what the fuck it is.  Then they got that NBC 3D channel. 
[02:18:00]  You see that one?  No.  Yeah, it's fucked up.  And it's two images.  How's it 3D?  They're like right next to each other.  Right.  It's that type of 3D.  You need the special 3D TV and the glasses and stuff.  Oh, you do?  But when you just watch it at my house, it's the same picture, but right next to each other.  So it's the two images.  And I guess when you put the glasses on, it kind of joins them together somehow.  So where do we get the glasses?  Well, you buy a TV, a 3D TV, and the glasses come with the TV.  That's too much work.  Kind of a thing.  How many glasses do you get?  What if you have a lot more friends than you need more glasses? 
[02:18:30]  You've got to buy some glasses.  I've got a 3D projector in my screening room.  How does that work?  You know what?  I've never...  I've watched fucking things on 3D the day I got it.  Ah, look at you.  I've never looked at it again.  I don't know.  I was like, hey, 3D?  Because I was changing the thing.  I wanted a better quality one.  And then the guy was like, you can get 3D for like 500 bucks more.  And I'm like, 3D?  I'll take it.  3D and 120 inches?  I'm in.  Does it show regular, too, though? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's all I watch it in now.  Yeah.  I bought one of those fucking Hubble DVDs that are in 3D.  Space imagery.  How is it?  It's pretty wild.  Pretty good, huh?  But then after that, you're like, all right, well, I just want to take these stupid glasses  off so I can watch a fucking movie like a fucking movie.  Did you invite Rogan over?  He fucking...  Rogan comes over wearing his pot shoes.  And fucking...  Yeah, pot shoes.  No, but I'm just thinking of what he does.  Let me get these hemp 3D glasses.  Obviously very funny, but knowing Joe, he probably does have pot shoes. 
[02:19:30]  Because that's the last time I saw Russell, I was actually with Joe in Vegas.  And Russell's a big UFC friend.  And we're talking in the bar.  Yeah, it should be an Olympic sport, but that's not going to happen anytime soon.  They're not going to do it?  No.  We were also talking about how to do it.  I mean, it does cover everything that's in the Olympics.  Exactly.  It's almost the decathlon of fighting sports.  You'd have to have the single elimination, though.  You'd have to have a bunch of people in fucking brackets and single elimination,  because they can't be fighting multiple times within the two-week span of the Olympics. 
[02:20:00]  That's true.  How did boxing do it, though?  Well, they're not really beating the shit out of each other.  We were talking about that a little before.  You don't really beat the living piss out of each other.  But I don't even know.  Do they fight more than once, or is it single elimination?  Oh, yeah, I know.  They fight more than once in boxing.  I think so.  But they've got the headgear.  And they all have to do it.  And they have stupid rules.  I don't know if they changed them, but they used to be...  No punching?  Yeah, exactly.  No body shots didn't count for points.  Really?  Oh, really?  This was just fucking head hunting.  Wow, that's weird.  Although, with a few well-placed body shots, it kind of opens you up to go for the head. 
[02:20:30]  Absolutely.  You wait until he's just falling down, and then you crack him once right in the face,  and he falls down, and you win.  Were you a good boxer?  No, nothing above average, that's for sure.  I mean, I can handle myself, but, you know.  Yeah.  Just for fun.  Yeah, I'm great in the street.  Ah, street fight guy.  In a gym, you know.  In the gym, it's a different story.  My coach...  I get off the first round, because it's like the first round.  I've got a shit ton of energy.  And then my coach reminds me that he used to be a world champion, and smacks me around 
[02:21:00]  for the next four rounds.  What weight was he?  I know.  I still train with him.  No, what weight is he?  Oh, he's like 150.  I'm 195.  So I'm like much bigger than him, but...  How many do you like hit the bag?  Things like that?  No, no.  We spar.  Me and my coach do spar.  Yeah, yeah.  I hit the bag the other day, actually, for the first time in a long time.  I did eight rounds on the bag.  Eight three-minute rounds.  That's tiring.  Yeah.  It is.  It's exhausting.  And in between every punch, I go, pepper, pepper, pepper, pepper. 
[02:21:30]  That would be so annoying.  I hope you annoy people in your gym.  No, but they put a sign up, because I used to hit the bag all the time.  Yeah.  And it's right next to the yoga studio.  In my thing, there's like a little yoga room.  Well, that's stupid on their part.  I agree.  But they said, please do not use boxing equipment while class is in session.  Because all these people were trying to fucking do downward dog, and they could hear me through  the door, just pow, pow, smash in the bag, and I'm glad it ruined their time.  That's cunts.  Open your mind. 
[02:22:00]  So you take some fucking punches and shit?  I do take some punches.  Yeah, you have to.  Yeah.  To the ribs?  I like that.  To the face, to the ribs, to whoever he's hitting.  You wear the headgear, though, right?  Yeah, I wear the headgear.  I don't like that shit, though.  I don't like fucking getting hit.  I hate getting hit.  Nobody likes getting hit.  That's why you box.  But why do you do it?  You learn how to avoid getting hit.  I don't know.  But you know, there's nothing more rewarding.  There's nothing more rewarding than getting a shot in the head, and then avoiding it the 
[02:22:30]  next time, and then being able to counter.  I can think of more rewarding things.  And get one of yours off.  You know what I mean?  Sinking a dick in a 10 is pretty rewarding.  Yeah, by that he means age.  But yeah, I guess, you know, it's amazing to me when I watch people, I'm always amazed,  even more than the guys punching, are the guys avoiding punches.  Like, I'm always amazed with someone who's ducking out of the way of a shot, or who's  avoiding a fight.  Because you really just have to move just enough. 
[02:23:00]  You don't have to do that whole, whoa.  You just have to, like, be able to...  A teeny bit, right?  Yeah.  No fucking Matrix shit.  You don't got to pull that.  Yeah.  Fucking lean backwards.  Whoa!  You can just...  Yeah, but you got to get the noise when you do it.  Yeah, yeah.  If it's like a glancing, kind of a little blow to the side, it's not going to be as bad.  I don't like getting hit, though.  I fucking...  Nobody does.  But see, the thing is, you're going into a position where you're going to get hit.  Like, I don't even want to be put in that position.  You avoid that.  I don't like being hit so much that when I get into a fight, it distracts me so much 
[02:23:30]  that I can't even fucking function, because all I'm thinking about is getting hit.  You don't like getting hit to the point where you, you know...  Well, yeah, of course, but, you know.  You know, what amazes me is when guys are boxing, and they say that he's watching...  Like, when guys are studying each other in the ring, like, a guy will watch what another  guy is doing while he's throwing punches, and go, okay, he's leaving his arm up, I'm  going to counter...  Like, that, to me, is amazing.  Actually thinking.  Yeah!  My coach times me all the time, and then he'll, like... 
[02:24:00]  You know, even when he's got me backpedaling for three rounds, he'll stop, take his mouthpiece  out and go, you've got to throw punches when you're moving backwards!  And then put his mouthpiece back in, and fucking keep attacking me!  Oh, shit!  Jesus!  Have you ever been knocked out?  Uh, not knocked out, but I've been knocked down a few times.  Yeah, uh-huh.  Not out cold, but I've, I've, you know, you get to that point where, like, well, I know  what's next.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  If I, if I stand up...  Take the knee, stupid, you know, there's no sense I'm being a hero right now.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:24:30]  So the, uh...  You just hear, bing!  Yeah, you really do.  Uh, I hate that.  You're like, oh, this sucks.  What's the next weight on?  Can anybody else hear me talk to myself?  Are you, are you, are you a heavyweight or no?  195 is what?  What is it?  Uh, I would just, I think, I think I would just be over the cruiserweight limit, if anything,  or just within the cruiserweight limit.  But that's too big of a weight for a guy my size.  I should be, if I was, say, I was a fighter, I'd, I, the biggest I, I would possibly go  is, is possibly super middleweight or, or, or light heavyweight. 
[02:25:00]  What is light heavy, what is heavyweight?  How much is that?  220?  Oh, no, it's over 200.  Anything over 200.  Oh, just over 200.  Okay, so they're a little lighter than UFC heavyweights.  Yeah, yeah, the, the, the, the, the weight thing is very different in UFC than it is for,  for boxing.  Because even foreman, what was foreman as heavy, like, when, when, when, when, he was such  a beast.  He was about 256.  Was he really?  Oh, was he that big when he was fighting all the way?  Oh, no, not when he was fighting Ali.  A lot heavier.  When he came back.  He must have been around 220.  Yeah, when he came back, he was, yeah, he was about 250.  Heavyweight boxes are a lot heavier than fucking UFC guys. 
[02:25:30]  No, UFC guys are heavier.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Oh, UFC guys are way heavier.  I thought boxes were heavier than heavyweight UFC guys.  No, no, no.  No, even, even their welterweight.  Fuck me running.  In general, they're way bigger.  Even their welterweight division in UFC is like 165, you know what I mean?  Right.  And what is, middleweight's like 175, 180?  What was the other round?  Yeah, 175, 180.  180, 185 is the middleweight.  185, right.  Yeah.  So it's, you know, it's way different.  Sure.  Yeah, because you looked at Foreman when him and Ali fought, and you're like, he just seemed 
[02:26:00]  like such a giant of a man, such a big dude.  And that was then where, like, the heavyweights weren't even as big as they are now.  Right.  Now they've got the Klitschkos at a 6'7", and they're, you know, 240 pounds.  How heavy was Ali at his heaviest, do you think?  Maybe on the heaviest, maybe 230.  On his biggest day ever, possibly.  That's even bigger than I thought.  I guess Mr. Foreman, he looks smaller.  Yeah, but most of his fights, he was a lot lighter than that.  A lot lighter.  We were watching him yesterday on the Mike Douglas show. 
[02:26:30]  It was just a really awkward interview, because Mike Douglas' co-host was Sly from the Family  Stone, who was out of his mind, drunk, and Ali was a serious Muslim, and he, I don't want  a clown, I don't want a clown.  It was right before he fought Foreman.  It was when he was starting to train for George Foreman.  And just a different guy back then.  He hated everything that Sly was about.  He hated it.  And they were probably friends off camera.  You know, Ali probably liked Sly.  But he couldn't tell the world that.  Yeah, he just didn't like the idea of two black people clowning around on fucking TV  for white people.  Laughing and shucking and jiving. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, he just, he felt, and he goes in, and he'd get on TV and his white people, he's  doing the smile, Ali.  But Ali would always do the fucking, you know, hey, Cosell, get over.  So he was clowning and fucking.  He loved clowning.  Yeah, but he was clowning as Ali.  And he was making Cosell look stupid.  Maybe he would clown on his own time.  Yeah.  It was kind of like controlled clowning.  Yeah.  Controlled clowning, right.  He didn't want to clown with Sly in a pimp outfit whose breath was reeked of alcohol.  Fucking smelled like Ripple.  He's talking to the heavyweight champ.  I think Howard Cosell was.  Ripple. 
[02:27:30]  You think he was racist?  Oh, probably.  Howard Cosell?  Probably.  Yeah.  Oh, when he would fucking get back into the dressing room, he'd look around.  That nigga got me again.  Oh my God.  He probably did.  Didn't see it coming.  I can't believe he did it to me again.  Take his wig off, scratch his head.  Motherfucker.  Before I die, I'm putting that spook in his place.  He probably said that.  Dude, Ali won every time they argued. 
[02:28:00]  Ali won every time.  And occasionally Howard would annoy him with a tough question or a tough analysis.  Like, he would irritate Ali with his analysis of a fight or why he would think that Ali was going to lose to Norton or Foreman or whatever.  Yeah.  And then Ali would call him out.  Like, you know, he thought I was going to lose and he would be really irritated.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he could never, ever match which with Ali.  We got any of this?  Ali versus Fiskal?  She turned this way, Sam.  You're not at home watching TV. 
[02:28:30]  Oh.  Ah, it's too low.  Is that as loud as the fucker goes?  Something's going on with our volume on the computer today.  Crank it like full.  Well, it is from the 70s, so it's probably in mono.  Yeah, we're pinned over here.  Gain is up.  The gain.  I'll just move shit.  I don't know.  I don't know what half of the shit does.  Ah, fuck it.  It's in one channel.  They were both young.  It's low.  Really?  Howard Cassell looks like he could be 35 or 60. 
[02:29:00]  He can't even tell, yeah.  We should take him to a fair and see if they could guess his age.  You're somewhere between 35 and 60.  Holy fuck.  How old do you think he was there?  He was probably 45.  Oh, man.  48.  He looked like he could be 60.  Yeah.  Who knows?  He must have been older than that.  Maybe he was.  When did he croak?  In the 80s, right?  No, after that.  90s?  Yeah.  Made to the 90s.  Yeah.  Wow.  That might be pre-toupé.  Is it?  It is.  It looks pre-toupé.  It looks like he's just bald. 
[02:29:30]  It's pre-toupé.  And then, yeah, because look at that one.  Oh, yeah.  My hair hat.  What year, Sam, was he around?  And don't lie or I'll know.  He died in 95.  95?  When was he born, though?  1918.  Yeah.  He was born in 1918.  Holy shit.  Oh, wow.  Say that was 1970.  Even his Wikipedia has cocksure personality.  He could technically be alive.  He was probably 52 when that was done.  Imagine you're born six years after the Titanic went down.  That's silly.  That's hilarious. 
[02:30:00]  That's just silly.  Come on.  The ravages of World War I are, like, just wrapping up.  Oh, right.  Your father died from the plague.  The Black Plague, Mom?  I'm going to ruin Ali.  Yeah.  And now I have a go.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah, look at him with the gray wig.  Yeah, because he's, like, bald there.  He's going bald.  At least he had wigs that matched his hair, you know, aging.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  His wigs aged with him. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, he had it figured out.  With him with a cigar.  It was so funny.  During the time, he had it figured out.  Ali would brutalize him for his shitty hair pieces.  Yeah.  What's that?  No, I'm going to grab that wig off your head.  He would do that.  Now, Mohammed.  Stop it.  That thing you got on your head.  Yeah, he'd goof on him all the time about that.  I like the pictures they're putting up in Google search.  It's got the count.  Let's see.  Yeah, the count is there.  He also was on the Odd Couple of few episodes. 
[02:31:00]  Those were a funny one.  Cosell.  Does he?  Yeah, yeah.  Cosell was like, I guess, one of Oscar's friends or something.  And then Felix gets in a little bit of a tiff with him, of course.  Much like Monty Hall when he was on, too.  Look at him.  Oh, there's Ali.  Oh, he's picking at it.  He's picking at the hair piece.  That shit does look terrible, though.  Oh, yeah.  The hairline is ridiculous.  It's just, it doesn't look like it's part of him at all.  Would he really take it off?  He would always grab at it like he was trying.  He never took it off. 
[02:31:30]  Cosell always put his hand on his hair and was like, stick to the point.  They did have a very funny relationship.  Yeah, it was very funny.  Very entertaining.  You think they liked each other off?  Yeah, absolutely.  Off camera?  Sure, sure.  You think they did dinner and all that shit?  Yeah.  I don't know if they did dinner, but I'm sure they, you know, they understood their relationship.  I mean, they were fucking, it was a very, Ali Cosell was, everyone wanted to watch them talk.  I think Larry Merchant wants to be Howard Cosell.  Yeah, you might be right.  He's got that kind of annoying presence, but without the charisma of Howard Cosell. 
[02:32:00]  He wants the adversarial slash respect relationship with boxers that Howard had, but he's not getting it.  It's not going to happen.  No, you see, who was it that yelled at Larry Merchant?  Floyd Mayweather.  Oh, that was great.  You know, one of my best friends was Vernon Forrest, and Vernon would always tell me, man, fuck Larry Merchant.  I was like, why?  Because he always used big words after a fight.  I just got punched in the head for 36 minutes, and I want to hear about a dossier? 
[02:32:30]  That's a good point.  He got shot, right?  Yeah.  In Atlanta.  Yeah.  What happened?  He was killed.  Jesus.  Dry, uh, carjacking.  Oh, man.  Well, I don't want to bring the show down to a fucking stitching hall.  No, but I thought it was at a gas station, I think.  It was a famous story.  In Atlanta?  Yeah.  Three years ago.  Jesus Christ.  I talked to his mom yesterday.  Fucking behave.  That's nuts.  Wow.  He chased the guy.  He had a pistol, and he chased the guy.  You can't tell a fighter not to fight, right?  Why would you? 
[02:33:00]  Well, he grabbed his gun and chased after the gun.  Oh, he had a gun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, how did he fucking, what did he do wrong?  He had it under his seat.  Oh, no.  Some guy, he was, or Vernon went and stopped to get gas, to get air in his tire.  Yeah.  And some guy came up and robbed him.  Yeah.  And then took off.  And then Vernon reached under his seat, grabbed his gun and chased after the guy.  And what happened?  He just laid it around and shot him?  No, the guy had him ambushed around the corner.  Oh, he fucking hit.  Oh, boy.  You got to be careful.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  And you don't go chasing the guy.  They got him eight times.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Eight times.  That's fucked. 
[02:33:30]  Seven or eight times.  You don't go chasing the guy?  Did they get the guy who did it?  Yeah, they got all three guys.  There was, like, three guys.  Three guys.  Wow.  That's fucking Sonny Corleone shit.  Yeah.  God damn brutal.  That's horrible.  How old was he?  He was, how old was Vern?  Let's see, he was three years ago.  He would have been 30, a year younger than me, so 38, 39 at the time.  Wow.  Thanks.  Really.  Nice for the show.  So, Sam, I like your hair.  Oh, see?  No, that's more tragic.  Jesus.  Chip should have taken us a break. 
[02:34:00]  His ass to air.  How'd he come back from that?  His friend died.  So, cayenne pepper sauce, huh?  Stuff's hot.  What else have you been up to, Russell?  Well, it's been a while.  Yeah, you know, getting divorced and...  God damn.  Really?  Yeah.  How old were you married?  Fuck.  I was long...  I was married.  I'd put in a good 14 months and...  14 months.  14 months.  Wow.  I did 14 months.  Jesus.  Your decision or mutual?  It was, you know, it was a bit of a rush job.  Those never work.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  No, no, I mean the divorce.  Is it something you're happy with or not happy with?  I mean, you know, it's...  I'm...  Yeah.  I'm not mad at it.  No.  You know, it's going well.  That's the good news.  Really?  Okay.  She's being cool.  Are you sure?  As far as I can tell.  Is there fucking, you know, 14 months, the money that you're...  No, you know, the thing is...  Oh, because you make a lot.  You're only on the hook for seven months.  For the woman.  What?  What are you talking about?  In California.  Oh, California.  Half the time of the marriage.  But that's crazy.  Because don't they just say, I don't care, you're married. 
[02:35:00]  You've got to give half of your shit.  No.  It was pretty...  I thought that was it.  It was pretty easy.  Really?  It was pretty easy to negotiate, because I also didn't work that year that we were married.  No.  So, I mean, if you want what I made that year, you kind of want half of nothing.  And how weird is it to hear logic?  I got fucked with future earnings.  How weird is it to hear just logic?  But I was married like nine years.  Wait, so what's the seven months out of 14?  I don't get it.  You're only on the hook for half the time you were married.  Well, they run like a prison system.  So you're married for 14 months.  Good time.  So you're on the hook for seven. 
[02:35:30]  They don't do that in New York.  But then I have a daughter, right?  So it's not like...  So even if, you know, regardless, I got to take care of my daughter.  I'm not going to let my daughter live in a shithole.  So, you know, we have to set them up.  I put her in a nice house and made sure she's got a good car.  Oh, boy.  You know, as long as my kid's good, that's the bottom line there.  So how long did you date before you get married?  I don't know if I know your dad.  No, I barely knew her.  I was dating her...  I'd known her eight months when I married her. 
[02:36:00]  Wow.  How long had you been a couple?  Like an official couple, three months.  Okay, so three months, then you said, let's just get married?  No, I knocked her up.  Okay.  But you still married her.  I mean, that was cool.  There you go.  I was trying to be a gentleman.  You know, here's...  On her defense, she wasn't the one who said, let's get married.  Oh, man.  I was the fucking retard.  I was like, let's probably get married.  That's what you do.  You're pregnant, let's probably get married.  What is it, 1955?  You get her fucking pregnant and you got to marry her.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  I mean, we did it real classy in Vegas.  All right.  We had an Elvis impersonator.  We really did.  That's the type of marriage that will last.  But here, I'm not making this up.  As soon as we said, I do.  The Elvis impersonator stang, fools rush in.  I swear to God, he was caught in a trap.  And I'm like, is this a fucking sign?  God, that's his biff.  Oh, he's got a bit.  That's his shtick.  We know it's his biff.  No, I don't talk about it on stage, but that's really what happened.  Wow.  My audience always goes, oh, it's the night.  No, no, no. 
[02:37:00]  He means the Elvis guy's a bit.  That's the Elvis guy.  Oh, no, not you, Russell.  That's the Elvis guy.  It's obvious to me that don't be Elvis guy.  That's his bit.  He's got a shtick when he does that.  Yeah.  He probably sings the same songs that every couple gets married.  Oh, yeah, not you.  No, that's his.  That's funny.  Oh, my God.  Now, how long into it, because I've never even been close.  How long into it did you just go like, oh, boy, this might be in trouble?  Probably, honestly, maybe a couple of weeks.  Really?  I might even have known before, but.  Yeah.  What was the.  What was it indicated? 
[02:37:30]  Was it just a chemistry thing, or was it something weird or small?  I don't know.  I mean, she was pregnant, so I kept making these concessions.  You know, she's pregnant.  Her hormones are out of control.  She could be having a bad day.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  And then after the baby, I was like, well, he's just had a baby.  Hormones again.  Oh.  And then, but by that time, we hadn't built up enough of a base for me to go, well, no,  this is, you know.  So it was, it was like, eh, forget it.  Fuck it. 
[02:38:00]  Just wrap this up.  You know what?  It's a wrap.  And I'm a, let's be honest.  I'm a comic.  We, we're not good in relationships at the best of times.  Comedians are in love with the idea of being in love.  Yeah.  But we're so instant.  We're such instant gratification people that when we meet a chick, we're within a week,  we're like, dude, I think I'm fucking in love.  This is the chick.  Right.  Because I got to do everything right away.  Right.  Because the reaction from, from your work, you, it's an immediate reaction from an audience.  Yeah.  That's the appeal of standup.  Yeah.  So we're like, oh, this is, this is the best thing ever. 
[02:38:30]  And all my friends are like, oh, not this shit again.  No, but he's right.  He's right.  You watch, how many comics do that?  He's speaking your language, Jimmy.  Yeah, we're fools.  He's fucking right.  And then, you know, and then, you know, that's like playing at the same club over and over.  You start going, I don't want to go in tonight.  And then we're like, you know what I need?  And you find a new club.  I need a new club.  Yeah.  Wow.  This club has fucking, uh, bigger, bigger goblets.  Goblets. 
[02:39:00]  Goblets.  Wow.  This chalice is full of beverage.  In love with the idea of being in love.  That's great.  But women have to understand, too, and this is where women in general, and I don't know  your girl at all.  I'm speaking, women in general, stop fucking nagging us.  Women just nag and nag.  It's like, do you understand?  Yeah.  You're going to be with a guy who will tolerate your fucking nagging.  Is that what you want?  Some fucking cuckold who tolerates your, stop. 
[02:39:30]  They just nag us.  They do.  What is that?  What is that about?  It's what they do.  And you know what it is?  It's not.  I want to fly first class.  Then let me dirty text with somebody.  How about that?  I'll put you in seat 1A.  You pretend you didn't see me texting my cock to somebody.  It's true, Jimmy.  It's true.  I'm sure there's a lot of women that'll line up for that deal.  But I mean, it's not even.  I think they don't line up for that deal, Sam. 
[02:40:00]  Comics, we want to be ourselves.  Yes.  And the minute somebody else who wants to, you know, a woman will come in and be like,  at first, it's all cool.  Yeah.  It'd be you.  And then after a while, like, eh, I don't like that.  You need to watch what you say to people.  Oh, bitch.  That's pretty fucked up.  Don't tell me how to talk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're selling out the Staples Center and you're hearing this?  Well, yeah.  I mean, you would hear all kinds of dumb shit.  Wow.  Not just from my ex-wife, but any chick. 
[02:40:30]  No one.  Chicks always eventually flip on me.  Right.  Yeah.  Yes.  Because as much as we like the idea of being in love, they like the idea of dating a certain  kind of guy.  I like dating a comedian.  He's funny.  But they don't realize that the stuff they find funny about us, we pretty much find repulsive  about ourselves.  And the stuff that we find funny, other comics find funny.  It's like doing a corporate gig and they go, oh, be as blue as you want.  Right.  Okie dokie.  And then you do and they go, you know, that wasn't very appropriate what you do. 
[02:41:00]  That was the CEO's wife that you said, did you want to come on her tip?  Yeah.  We wanted you to say two dams of shit and make a fart sound.  We didn't know you were going to say cunt lips and point at somebody.  But on the other hand.  We didn't know whose lips to picture.  I know there's probably a lot of fucking broads out there that are bitching, too, because  you know, the thing that made us fall for them, the sexy stuff, looks slutty and fucking,  you know, now you're a whore to a lot of guys. 
[02:41:30]  It's like what you like them for in the first place turns into something that is like, you  know.  I never criticize that.  To me, women are like car leases for me.  Oh, you fall in love with them right away.  And then after a couple of years, you're like, fuck, look at that one.  They put they put they put Bluetooth in that one.  Yeah, that's a nice hot.  That's a I never realized that this new car I got has a fucking hemorrhoid.  That new model doesn't.  The seats getting uncomfortable.  Yeah, we are quick fix fucking animals, man. 
[02:42:00]  And that's I accept it now.  Having gone through this, I'm like, I'm like, you know what?  I don't even think I can do a relationship.  I maybe maybe I could do a year.  Maybe I could do a year.  I was going to ask you if you would ever get married again.  No, I don't think you can't see it ever happened.  I can't see it.  Maybe when I'm much older and I'm already 42.  How much fucking older do I need to get married?  Believe me, you won't.  People people tell me all the time.  It's like, oh, you'll get married again.  They've said this for years since I fucking got divorced.  And I'm like, no, I will not.  Sorry.  I thoroughly enjoy going to an empty bed, to be honest with you. 
[02:42:30]  Great, right?  I can fucking lie down and sleep when the fuck I want.  I'm all over myself.  Yeah.  You know, however you spend an afternoon, Anthony.  You and your siestas.  Exactly.  Or even if it's not an empty bed, if there's a girl there,  I love when I can go through her purse and find the return ticket.  Like, ah, this is going well.  Oh, well, she's only here until Tuesday.  You know, you don't feel trapped for a comic.  Maybe for other guys, too. 
[02:43:00]  I can only speak from who I am, but feeling trapped is the worst.  You're probably speaking to a lot of guys out there, not just comics.  Yeah, I think so.  I agree.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  There are some times where it's just, you know, yeah, please just leave.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to go.  You're like, wow, you were fucking great the first time we fucked.  What happened the second time?  How were you good the first time and shitty the second time?  How did you go downhill from there?  I've actually heard that. 
[02:43:30]  But it's the fucking, when you feel trapped, that's the worst.  Like, I like, I hate to say it, I like what I can't have.  Like, when there's still something to be gained or to get, I'm in for the pursuit, man.  Once that conquers over, you're...  Have you ever banged a celebrity chick?  Only one porn girl.  And we've talked about it in the air, just Brie Olsen is the only celebrity girl.  You banged Brie?  I did, yeah.  Amanda?  What's her name again?  No, no, her real name is...  I forgot.  I believe that's it. 
[02:44:00]  I don't think that's it.  Oh, yeah, maybe.  No.  Something along those lines, though.  Yeah.  What is it?  Rachel.  It is Rachel.  Okay, that's fair enough.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  No world's left to come.  I wanted to when I was on the tour with Sheen.  Oh, man.  Oh, you worked with her?  Yeah.  Oh, I forgot you did that.  Yeah, and I was like, she's really cute.  She's nice, too.  Like, I was friends with her first.  And, like, I mean, I'm friends with her after.  I just don't talk to her.  But she was a nice girl.  She was very cute, yeah.  She was really into Jimmy.  She was a very...  And then she banged me once, and I didn't hear much from her after. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, boy.  You know, no surprise.  She has great feet.  See, I didn't even notice.  I noticed.  She's a little and cute.  I will always regret pulling out.  What?  I shouldn't have.  Why?  Because she's fucking phenomenal.  Yeah.  Yeah, I would get her pregnant.  Wow, you're insane.  For what reason?  I think she's done cream pie movies, though, so you're right.  Oh, man.  But for what reason would you get her pregnant?  She's so hot, she'd have to talk to me for the next 20 years.  See?  Oh, Jimmy.  But in three, you'd be like, would this bitch leave me alone? 
[02:45:00]  Not with Brie.  I don't think of Brie.  So you wouldn't mind being a father?  Not to her.  No, her I would knock up.  Yeah, that's good.  You'd be waiting for the perfect porn star to be the mommy of it.  No, not even a portion of Brie is fucking hot, man.  She is good.  You like feet.  I forgot about feet.  Well, you're a feet guy.  Oh, yeah.  I'll suck toes, bud.  Can you explain the feet thing?  Because we go over this all the time, and I'm still out.  I think this is the best explanation I can come up with.  Women's feet, to me, are like a credit report.  And if your feet are fucked up, we will not be going any further with this loan of my penis. 
[02:45:30]  Wow.  I thought you were going to say the feet are a credit report because they kind of tell the woman's life.  Like, they're all calloused and shitty.  If you can't take care of something you will be showing a lot of people, you can't take care of the rest of the shit.  If your feet smell, imagine what's going to happen in the middle of your equator.  So you don't like a fucking foot smell?  Like, I like a foot, a little bit of a stinky foot smell. 
[02:46:00]  Not stink, but if it has a little hue to it, a little something there, you're like, well, that's not too bad.  That's hot.  I don't notice feet at all.  At all?  Yeah.  Like, what's the turn on?  I mean, you're doing basics here, but do you get really turned on by just feet sometimes?  A fetish is defined by what makes you cum, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, wait, let me ask you, can you lay on, because there's different, like, I've been turned on by feet.  I'm not a freak about it, like, I want a girl to step on my face or nothing.  I just need to know that nice feet are present. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  You know something?  I can definitely agree with this right here.  And it's part of the whole package, and it's part of the whole, like, I like totally fucking nudeness.  Oh, yeah.  I like things like that.  And the foot is part of it.  Yeah, head to toe, don't put some fancy little thing.  It could start that way, but everything's got to come off.  Yeah.  I'm a visual guy.  I like, like, looking down and seeing, like, from fucking shoulder down to...  You don't like pulling the panties aside?  I do.  At the beginning, but at some point, everything's got to come off. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, but she's got to have some...  Eventually, you get that fucking burn on the side of your dick, because you keep fucking in the panties, rubbing against you.  Well, they're...  I'm not saying it's perfect there.  It's like shaving carrots down for fucks.  I'm not saying it's a perfect thing.  What are you doing?  I'm shucking my corn.  I want a girl to be dressed like Bob Nelson during his closing bit.  I need...  I need an outfit on a fucking bitch.  I really do.  No, I don't like outfits.  I like just looking at everything just... 
[02:47:30]  It's got to be natural, though.  It can't be that shit that you go into Victoria's Secret and buy.  I was walking in the village last night, and I saw a girl in a pink hot...  I Twittered it, but I saw her in pink hot pants, like shorts, carrying a yoga mat, and I heard pussy bulge.  It was literally...  It came down like it was a fucking huge...  And I lost my breath.  Like, I turned around, and I looked at her ass, and I'm like...  It was almost all-consuming.  You tweet this?  I tweeted just the thought about jerking off in the street. 
[02:48:00]  Yoga pants are the best thing ever invented.  But I wish I had that response to feet, like, because for me, that's a fetish.  But feet don't do it.  But there's guys that will see...  Like, that janitor the other day that offered a girl...  He lost his job.  He offered this college girl a hundred bucks to suck her toes.  And she goes, no.  He goes, look, we can go to the ATM.  I'll give you whatever you want.  Like, that's the moment I had with that woman, and I would have said that to her if I would have had a chance to talk to her.  But he assumed he could say that to her.  I don't think...  It doesn't sound like he was a creep about it.  He realized he went too far and was trying to do right by her. 
[02:48:30]  The creepiest thing I'll do is ask a chick, can I see your feet?  Really?  At dinner?  That's pretty creepy.  I don't walk up to a stranger.  Excuse me.  Would you want a girl to whack you off of their feet or anything like that?  No.  Nothing.  I think we're in the same fucking boat.  I'm just seeing what level of his...  No, but they have to...  The feet have to be present in order for me to nut.  You get off on her feet.  Like, if I'm fucking a chick, and she's like, come now, I'll just have to do this.  Oh, there's your feet.  Bam!  Wow.  Just grab one.  So do you like a girl on her back?  Will you ever hold her feet up?  Because I've sucked toes. 
[02:49:00]  Would you suck a girl's toes while you're fucking her?  I'll lick them.  I won't suck them, because it feels too dicky-like.  Oh, so...  No.  Too dicky-like.  And not only that, you feel like you're sucking on a three-year-old kid, but that's  fucking little dicky-toe.  Sure.  Sure.  I've never heard it explained that way.  Beautiful.  What about a good pair of shoes?  A good pair of shoes will get me there.  Will get you going, huh?  But then I want to see those off.  I like them to start with shoes on, and I don't want the feet to touch the ground, because 
[02:49:30]  I don't want the feet to be dirty.  What about the gladiator shoes?  Is that it?  No, those are fucking...  That's not a good look, right?  What are we, in the Coliseum?  I don't know.  A lot of girls are wearing those fucking things now.  Are you not today?  That's probably.  Are you not entertained yet?  It's probably the number one shoe they're wearing, right?  Father of a murdered son.  I don't know.  Yeah, they're all wearing these fucking Maximus straps all around.  Yeah, I don't like that shit.  They look very gladiator-ish.  Yeah, what is that?  Bitch, you can't...  What, are you going to fight a lion?  Get out of here.  That'd be interesting.  So you're getting a divorce. 
[02:50:00]  Are you guys going to be cool for the kid?  Oh, yeah.  No, we're cool.  We're very cool, actually.  Did she have nice feet?  She had amazing feet.  Oh, wow.  I even told her, I go, those fucking feet are why we're here today.  What makes nice feet to you?  Are they...  Good nail bed.  Right.  No one long toe.  You don't want this toe hanging, the finger toe.  Oh, you don't want...  You like the long, the big fat toe to be...  I like them all symmetrical.  Okay.  Oh, you don't like when the big toe is going off to the right a bit, too far?  I don't want the big...  I don't want a bunion.  I don't want the big toe whispering to the pinky toe. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Hey, there's a potty in the middle.  And how about no fucking, like, talon ligaments?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you don't want to see fucking big, nasty ligaments connecting the fucking...  I don't want to see knuckles.  Yeah, yeah, knuckles.  Really?  Russell screwed this out.  I don't want flat feet.  Flat feet are disgusting.  You like a nice arch.  Oh, yeah, an arch.  Now, let me ask you.  Do you like when, like, if you...  Say you were jerking off on a cam looking at feet.  Would you like if the feet crinkled at you?  Oh, I love the crinkle.  You could see the crinkle, see?  The crinkle.  What is that about?  I don't know. 
[02:51:00]  The crinkle cut.  I'm a big fan of that.  I like bound Chinese feet.  Where's Yoshi?  But you like...  What does the crinkle do for you?  What is, like...  I don't know what it is, but the crinkle just gives you something.  Do you want to lick the crinkle?  No, you just want to look at it and you go, yeah, I need to nut on that crinkle right  there.  Ah.  You know what's kind of cool, though, too?  I've nutted on a chick's feet before.  If you're hanging out with a girl and she's, like, got her feet up on an ottoman or something,  and unconsciously...  Or a georgeman.  Oh, shit.  And she's just unconsciously moving her toes around a little bit. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  I love all that.  It's kind of cool.  Yeah, that's the thing.  It's also...  It's kind of cool.  It's also when it's blatant, I don't want to see it.  Right.  It's got to have that sort of...  Kiss my...  Shut up.  Yeah, you're like, no, no, I just need to...  I need to not have you not know that I'm looking at your feet.  That's what I'm like.  See, you're like...  Here's what happened.  I'm a creep.  I'm a creep.  No, no, here's what happened.  A nice Mary Jane buckle.  When Russell was a young boy, when Russell was a young boy, he probably looked at a girl's  feet naughtily.  It was probably his teacher, when somebody would peek at her toes and get little or big Russell  erections as a young lad, and that's the naughtiness. 
[02:52:00]  They were little tiny boners back then, but...  But that's the naughtiness.  I would be distracted in my ninth grade typing class.  The teacher was a flicker.  If you go to YouTube, there's flicking, dipping, there's all kinds of...  The shoe flicker.  Heel popping.  There's all kinds of terms for it.  Do you like the shoe hanging?  Because I know...  The dangling?  Yeah.  I'm a big dangler.  What?  Do you like stockings on them or bear?  I prefer them bear.  A nice bear with a dangling shoe?  Yeah.  Because it's something seductive. 
[02:52:30]  Dipping is my favorite.  What's dipping?  When they're standing there...  That's a dipping video, Sam.  Please.  When they're standing there and they just...  You know, their feet are sore, so they just keep pulling them out of their shoe and putting  it back in.  Oh.  It's something so sexy.  It is.  It doesn't hit me, but I get it.  Yeah.  It's almost like you're seeing something...  There's a creep right there.  This is an illegal video.  That's my shit.  I could like...  I've actually jerked off to this type of stuff before.  Just feet under a desk.  It's a desk video.  I could look up the skirt.  Like a girl is just taking her foot in and out of her...  Yeah, in the upskirts. 
[02:53:00]  You're a little more than me.  You're a little more than me.  I can't just look at that.  That does nothing for me.  No, no.  But I would also need to see what she looked like.  I can't just do it to a fucking torso.  Some guy had to film this and he's getting off filming this.  Oh, God.  He's fucking...  He probably jerked off angrily to this video.  Big rod.  Yeah.  I just don't understand that one.  That looks like something I would have done.  Really?  Because I'm a fucking creep.  Have you filmed like that before?  No, I've taken pictures like that before.  At a restaurant, you pretend you're checking a text and you click, click, click under  the table. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, shit.  Wow, you like feet.  I had a girl flash a fat pussy at me like that on purpose.  It was...  The naughtiness of doing it under the table was awesome.  I was...  What do you mean?  How did it go down?  She has a big, fat, Native American pussy.  And you were just in a restaurant?  Native American pussy.  Hold on.  Did you know who you were?  And you wanted to conquer that.  We were eating together.  Oh, you were eating together.  Yeah, she showed it to me and it was fucking...  It looks like there's something wrong with her.  It's so big.  And it fucking floored me.  But that's...  A lot of guys find that gross. 
[02:54:00]  And a lot of guys find feet gross.  I just...  Whatever a fetish is, man.  Or big, fat pussies.  What do you mean?  A lot of people don't like big, fat pussies.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I mean, I don't like ugly pussies.  You know, there's...  Nobody's big, fat...  How would you find a pussy flesh?  Gross.  No, no, no.  Meaning they don't like...  The big, fat pussy, what it does for me are what feet do for him.  It's irrational.  Like...  Yeah, he likes pussy and you like...  But, like, Ant prefers, like, a small...  You know, Ant, he likes, like, a little slit pussy or whatever.  You know what big, fat pussy does for me?  He takes us to break.  That's right. 
[02:54:30]  Poofed down, hoofed down.  What's he doing today, you think?  I don't know.  He's writing fan fiction.  Oh, fan fiction.  You're not fan fiction.  Sam says you're writing fan fiction during the show.  Is that true?  For the record, there's a place called WikiFeet you can go to.  Oh, really?  We're going back to the feet.  Boy, you really are...  You go to WikiFeet and type in any celebrity's name and her feet come up.  Oh.  Oh, all right.  Now, who's got the best celebrity feet?  Who would know about wicky feet?  I don't know, offhand.  You know who's got horrible feet?  Paris Hilton, terrible. 
[02:55:00]  I like her feet, terrible.  You know who has great feet?  Joy Bayhar.  Oh, God, no way.  Okay, now let me ask you.  Could you jerk off to her feet?  Yes, I could.  See, that's so weird.  Let's look at her feet.  Let's have an open mind here, guys.  She's got really nice feet.  I don't know.  Those are little old lady feet.  They're not.  They don't look like old lady feet at all.  They could be man feet.  No, I don't like those at all.  What makes these feet good there, Russell?  I don't know, look at the proportion, good nail bag.  They're too wide.  They're like wide feet.  They're kind of wide, Russell.  They're like slippers.  No, she's got a good arch, too. 
[02:55:30]  I don't like her feet.  No, they're hurting me.  Go to Paris Hilton.  Let me see that.  Would you suck her feet?  No, I'd probably just jerk off on her.  Who do those?  Joy.  Who's Joy?  That's called a she-flat.  Does she know that you like her feet?  I've never met her.  Let's call her up.  We know her.  Go to Paris Hilton.  Watch this bullshit.  I like her feet.  Paris Hilton?  Brutal.  She's got talons.  Yeah, Paris Hilton looks like she plays soccer with a medicine ball.  Terrible.  Big fucking talon-ish.  They don't get good pictures of the feet.  Oh, God, Russell. 
[02:56:00]  What's wrong with these feet, Russell?  I like her feet.  Well, first of all, there's a bunion.  Oh, is there a bunion?  That's awful.  She's got a short nail bed.  Her big toe is shorter than her middle toe.  And they're bulbous.  Yeah, that's horrible.  Holy awful.  God, that's terrible.  Yeah, those are worse than I thought.  Yeah.  The bunion stinks.  Terrible.  You know what else doesn't have good feet?  They look like chicken feet.  What's her name?  Fucking Mia Wallace.  Mia Kunis?  Oh, I didn't even Nabel King.  No.  Who, Mia Kunis?  No, no.  Heather Mills?  I was saying a character she played.  Mia Wallace. 
[02:56:30]  Russell, give us one you like.  Come here.  Wiki feet.  Uma Thurman.  Oh, yeah.  Uma Thurman's got awful feet.  Bastard.  Salma Hayek's got good feet.  How do you know?  All right.  Let's go to Uma's first.  See Uma.  Uma Thurman.  Tell us what's wrong with Uma's feet.  Let's take a look at them.  Well, you can't really see them there.  All right.  Keep going.  I was with Tarantino one night and we were talking about it.  He's a foot guy.  He loves feet, too.  Yeah.  He's always in his movies.  He's always got a foot shot in his movies.  I was like, all right.  You know, he did our show once and we had a great time with the guy.  He's great.  And he never came back.  Go up. 
[02:57:00]  Kind of bummed about that.  But he's not like he's doing a lot of radio in New York.  He's never here.  No, I hope we get him back on.  I saw him.  You can zoom.  I did a lot of what I'm here, remembered.  Let me see.  Yeah, those aren't good either.  See the short toe and the long rest of the toes?  Yes, yes.  All right.  Who has great feet, you said?  Salma Hayek.  Yeah, let's go to which one.  Delicious.  Salma Hayek, yeah.  Would you suck her toes?  I probably would, yeah.  Would you jerk off on them?  Yes, I would definitely do that.  Dust till dawn, man.  Wait, you're breaking the rule with the sucking of the toes.  She looks great.  But Salma Hayek, I mean, what do you do?  Would you suck Joy Behar's feet?  Ugh.  Probably. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, God.  Under the desk?  Like, you'd have to listen to her talking to fucking Barbara on the Walters.  You know, Sherry Shepard kind of gasser.  If I could put on my noise-canceling headphones.  That's not a bad foot right there.  Yeah, that's a good foot.  Salma Hayek.  Yeah, that's great.  She's pretty much flawless.  She probably has nice piles if she has them.  Piles?  She has shingles.  I'd eat them.  Fucking, she's amazing.  Piles.  Yeah, she looked great in Dust Till Dawn.  Holy shit. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, Edward Norton was dating her for a long time.  That's not good there.  There you go.  That's not a good shot of them.  That pinky is a little a mess.  A little a mess.  Let me ask you.  Now, there's got to be a go-to picture or video that just gets you every time.  Like, what is a go-to foot picture for you that you've gone to way more than once?  That's a good question, Jimmy.  I'm glad you asked.  I don't know.  I have such a short attention span.  Oh, yeah.  That it's like, eh, all right, I did that one already. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, yeah.  You like a new foot picture, right?  Yeah, it's like, oh, who haven't I seen?  You must love the summer.  I love all the news chicks.  The news chicks always fucking get me, dude.  The fucking news chicks.  Like, you ever watch...  They don't show their feet.  No, watch Fox and Friends.  Those fucking Gretchen Carlson and those whores.  Gretchen Carlson.  Of course.  What a horrible name.  That's so funny.  How about Grena Van Sustern?  Does she have nice feet?  Doesn't she have a man face?  Yeah.  Yes.  No, we don't need that.  We don't need that.  We don't need that in our lives. 
[02:59:00]  No, no.  She should be in the fucking second dark night.  That's terrible.  She should be in the light night.  Yeah.  Fucking Harvey Dent.  Yeah, it's just part of the package.  The whole package.  You can just type her into WikiFeet there.  I did.  That'll come up, won't you?  WikiFeet.  Something new today.  That's pretty funny.  I never knew that.  WikiFeet.  They're not good shots.  They're like, you know.  Do they have the top feet?  They have like the pics of the week.  They do have pics of the week. 
[02:59:30]  You know what the thing is on Fox and Friends?  You can get an upskirt a lot of times because they're, they always wear those short skirts  and I'm not mad at that.  Oh my God.  They're that fancy little desk.  I used to get, I used to get, I used to buy in the porn stores upskirt videos.  They would be silent movies and there would just be some guy walking around New York  all day shooting upskirts.  I mean, there was, there was a guy, yeah, it was video cassettes.  There was a guy caught in Toronto at, uh, he had, uh, those Oxford, those brogue type  shoes on, but he had put a camera right in one of the holes of the brogue and he was 
[03:00:00]  walking around the fair with fucking dress shoes on.  How'd they catch him?  Like, cause it was summertime and he just kept standing.  Like say you were playing a game.  He would stick his foot right underneath.  Right.  And, uh, and, and, and lean back.  So it looked like he wasn't doing anything, but somebody just kept catching the guy that  was going up to every chick with a short skirt with his foot right under their ass.  It would seem to be hard to catch.  I'd use like a 1980s camcorder.  On your fucking, on your big toe.  Just creep over.  No, holding it.  Oh, just holding it.  Just shove it under a dress.  No, I would, I would use the one that used to, they used to go, da-na-na, da-na-na-na. 
[03:00:30]  Remember the fucking HBO opening?  Yeah.  Or like on the fucking Sunday afternoon movie?  Where you have to crank it?  Yeah, the guy on the fucking, uh, the old cranking camera.  You and you are going, digga, digga, digga, digga, digga, digga, digga, digga, digga, digga.  Yeah, I, I, I don't know about, um, I'm not a big upskirt.  I love an upskirt guy.  I mean, it's kind of cool, but it's gotta be real.  Like, I hate phony upskirt things.  Yeah, no, no, no, I don't want, I don't like fake shit either.  I don't want real.  I don't like fake stuff.  Fake voyeur.  Fake voyeur shit is the worst. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Real voyeur shit is fantastic.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's hard to find real shit.  Like a woman in fucking distress.  Like, what's better than somebody trapped in a fucking flipped over car and her dress is up somewhere?  Oh, yes.  And, and, like, even, I mean, you want to make sure she's okay, but at the same time,  As the flames are creeping, you're dipping your fingers in.  Nice.  Help is on the way.  Shut up.  You know, Anthony, if you go to Lobster Tube and then check out their voyeur section,  you might be happy.  Oh, is it pretty good?  Let's go to Lobster Tube.  What's Lobster Tube?  It's one of those other tubes. 
[03:01:30]  Another tube.  And it's not a fake voyeur.  All right.  I like voyeur.  No, there's some fake, but there's some really good ones in there, too.  Oh, man.  Voyeur's great.  God.  Jimmy, you'll love this place.  Free porn all over.  It's fantastic.  Is that like Clitty.com?  It's the same site.  It's all the same.  It's all the same shit.  They're all the same.  Upskirt sex?  Look at that.  No, go to voyeur.  Go to cuckold.  There's voyeur and there's upskirt.  Voyeur right there.  Go to teen.  Lobster.  What's it called?  What's it called, Russell?  Lobster Tube.  Lobster Tube.  Lobster Tube.  You can see the real ones.  It'll be like...  Why do they name things like that?  Everybody's red.  Ah, that's good.  Go ahead.  There's like... 
[03:02:00]  There'll be one...  Like, you can tell the real ones.  It'll be like some guy, his wife will be sleeping.  This is my wife's ass.  Oh.  Wow.  And then you'll be like...  Wow.  Bullshit.  That looks fake.  That's fake.  Jesus, Sam.  Scroll down, Sammy.  Oh, look at that hairy fucking muck.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  That areola.  What is that?  Click on sensual there.  Sensual.  No, there you go.  Who's a big boy?  What's going on?  Oh, no.  That's fake.  Get rid of it.  It's fucking porn. 
[03:02:30]  I hate fucking porn shits like that.  I told you music is a dead giveaway.  Yeah.  Like, if there's a cuckold video or whatever, whatever the video is, if they're playing like a real  song, that's not porn.  Because no porn company could license Journeys.  Yes.  What's that one right there with the upskirt?  Which one?  Oh, yeah.  Under table cam.  Under table cam, Sam.  That has a real look to it. 
[03:03:00]  She's falling around her legs.  Somebody fucking put their own music behind it.  And she's falling around her legs to watch for the setup.  Yeah, that's fake.  That's fake.  Yeah, come on.  Turn it this way, honey.  Yeah, come on.  Give us a little look here.  A little bit more apart.  Too much fake shit out there.  On an exclusive video.  In this video, you're going to discover a secret that most men will never know.  No.  First, let me warn you.  This secret is so powerful. 
[03:03:30]  All right.  Shut up, friend.  Yes.  Fucking English guy.  What's the secret?  It's so powerful.  When it comes to penis pills, information is power.  Or PastyVac.  Yeah, this is fake because she's like lifting her skirt.  Yeah, look.  Now she's just spreading her legs.  The guy's zooming down there.  I love it.  Oh, my goodness.  Look at this.  It's great.  She's lifting up.  It's fucking mushing her pussy stuck to the fucking thing like the alien monster.  That's a great twat.  I'd love to say that to her in an email.  You have a great twat. 
[03:04:00]  Subject.  Great twat.  Yeah, and the whole email is, you've got one, sister.  R-E.  Great twat.  Yeah, she's lovely.  Oh, fuck.  Russell turned us on to a few things today.  You're welcome, guys.  Oh, man.  Lobster Tube and WikiFeet.  The Lobster Tube, a lot of them just go like X Hamster, I think, is the best site.  I like X Hamster.  It's phenomenal.  Oh, yeah.  X Hamster is really good.  I like that a lot.  I'm a big fan of the X Hamster as well.  And a lot of these mega sites just go to X Hamster and Alpha Porno and a few of these 
[03:04:30]  other sites.  Yeah.  And the porn girls are shit out of luck.  Oh, yeah.  They're pissed.  It's hard for them to make money.  You know who owns most of the tube sites is Brazzers.  Who's Brazzers?  Brazzers.com.  What's that?  It's a giant porn company.  Internet porn company.  Didn't know that.  They do the Mommy's Got Boobs, Big Wet Butts.  Some Big Wet Butts.  What's Big Wet Butts?  Big Wet Butts.  It's a chick with a nice big ass. 
[03:05:00]  They just pour oil all over it.  Make it all shiny.  And then the guy pounds it.  You like the big butts there, Russell?  I do.  I'm a big fan.  That's nice.  Wow.  Big Wet Butts is nice.  Oh, she's got a big one in her.  That's a little too big.  Some of them might be, yeah, but a good ass with baby oil on, it's hard not to enjoy.  I like a nice big fat ass.  Well, baby oil will make every butt look a little fat ass.  I grew up in a black neighborhood.  I'm not into the fat ass. 
[03:05:30]  No, I need it.  You like black girls or white girls?  I like any girls.  I'm not going to pick it all up.  I'm a racist.  I prefer white or Spanish chicks, but black girls are very sexy.  My first was a black girl.  Really?  Really?  How was it?  Don't ruin the illusion.  No one was asking.  No problem at all there.  Well, I happen to be a racist.  You don't have to say that.  No, when it comes to chicks, though, I can't go black.  I just don't find them attractive.  It doesn't go exotic at all.  No, no, no.  I am into a fucking white trash chicks.  I love a good Long Island white trash. 
[03:06:00]  Jersey white trash girls.  They're the best.  What's the most exotic girl you've done?  Most exotic girl?  Yeah, what was she?  Boston.  Oh, my God.  Some white chick.  Yes, Boston.  Fucking white girl with a parrot.  Yeah.  Never no Asian, or slightly Asian, or slightly Hispanic.  Never.  Never.  So what was the most exotic?  A girl with dark hair.  That's about it.  A regular white girl with dark hair.  And it was a wig.  That's about it.  On her ass.  So she would look like she was blown up. 
[03:06:30]  Probably some Italian chick.  That's about it.  Most exotic I've ever gone.  Aren't you Italian?  Yeah.  There you go.  You're like, I'm already bringing exotic to the table.  Yeah, I'm already fucking...  I like a fucking...  Spanish girls are very sexy.  Oh, yeah.  They're great, and their vaginas are incredible, but the price you've got to pay for really  hot and sexy is crazy.  Yeah.  Bat shit, right?  Bat fucking shit.  Yeah.  I've, uh...  You don't lie.  I tell you, I haven't had fucking free box in so long. 
[03:07:00]  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  You don't want to, like, make the effort, you know?  It's a lot of effort.  Just bring it in.  You need a hug?  No, I just realized.  You sure you did?  I...  My game is terrible.  Do you want to go out tonight?  I do.  I see...  My swag's on a thousand right now.  Your swag.  I see girls, and, uh...  I have no game anymore, dude.  I've been paying for pussy for too long.  I have no fucking vibe.  Oh.  Well, no, it is a routine. 
[03:07:30]  Like, I mean, I get into these jerk-off slumps.  Sure.  Right?  Me too.  I started one in 1979.  Until present.  Until it's just a dash with nothing effort.  And then you get used to jerking off, and then you're kind of like, I don't want pussy.  I just rather jerk off.  Yeah.  But then you start getting a pussy routine, and you're like, I don't want to jerk off.  I want some pussy.  I want some pussy, huh?  Yeah, I mean, yeah.  You just need to get some free pussy, and it'll put you back on track.  Maybe you're right.  Yeah.  I'm tired of tugging my own dick for Pete's sake.  Well, don't do it for the sake of Pete. 
[03:08:00]  Do it for Jimmy's sake.  Sam, your hour today, you've got to get Jimmy free pussy.  That's your whole goal today, okay?  I will.  I'll try to talk to the ladies of Chicago, maybe for Friday.  Let's talk to the ladies of Chicago.  He says she's a good city for that.  Dude, I love Chicago.  We're going to Chicago.  Friday, Russell.  I was just there.  I know.  Huh?  Yeah.  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Oh, ew.  Nice.  Oh, ew.  No, I said ill, ill, ill.  No, Russell understands.  He's a sabbath.  Just my Aussie.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You like the sabbath, Russell?  I don't hate the sabbath. 
[03:08:30]  He's a kiss fan.  Russell's a big kiss fan.  I'm a kiss junkie.  I'm a kiss junkie.  Big kiss guy.  Really?  Yep.  That's how Russell and I, 2005, this is what a nice guy Russell is.  Yoshi introduced us and Russell came to my HBO half hour and brought me a very nice kiss  book as a congratulatory gift.  That was the night you guys introduced him.  Oh, did you guys introduce me?  I don't even remember that.  Yeah, you were there.  Oh, you were in the audience.  You were in the audience.  Yes.  Yes, right?  Yeah.  Jimmy's good that way.  He's very nice of him.  Hey, Jim. 
[03:09:00]  I bring Russell Peters to say hi.  Yeah, Russell say hi.  Briehlson say hi.  Lemix Lewis say hi.  Owen A say hi.  Hi.  Hi.  People that never say hi.  I never say hi.  No, who says hi?  That's Yoshi.  Russell's just trying to form alliances.  Yeah, Yoshi's a weird dude.  I like him, though.  Don't get me wrong.  I love Yoshi, but he's a psychopath.  He's strange.  Yoshi's crazy.  He's strange.  He's the most well-meaning strange person ever.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's great.  He's a great dude.  He loves working with you.  I would love to work with Russell.  Just walking into a packed house that I know, even the fuck if they're not there to see 
[03:09:30]  me.  Do you want to do it?  You're out of your audience would hate me.  Yeah, but that doesn't matter.  I'd be doing it for us, Jimmy.  I would love to, but it would be humiliating just to bomb in front of fucking...  I'm going to have Tom Rhodes open at the Barclays Center for me.  You know Tom, aren't you?  I do know Tom.  He was big in Australia for a while.  He's American.  Amsterdam he was.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Was it Amsterdam?  Is he back for good now?  Yeah, he's back.  Why did he...  Did he cancel?  He was on for a while, right?  He was on for a while, and then he wanted to move back to America. 
[03:10:00]  Can I say the best fucking talk show ever is Graham Norton in England?  Yeah, he's good.  That motherfucker's show.  And I know him very, very casually because we were doing Tough Crowd.  I think I did it once with Graham.  He's a very sweet guy.  Anyway, he has the best set.  You can't not love looking.  It's just multicolored, and I was watching a clip of Ozzy and Sharon last night when they  were promoting Ozzy's book back in 2009, and Gervais was on the panel, but Graham is 
[03:10:30]  weird.  He brings out Ozzy and Sharon and Ricky at the same time.  He introduces them back to back and sits them all.  He has these weird collections of people on his panel, and then the first segment's Ozzy  and Sharon, and Ricky just hangs out, and he'll pipe in with a line, and then he goes,  okay, now Ricky, and he talks to Ricky, and then Ozzy and Sharon will kind of be quiet  or pipe in with a line.  It's a really cool fucking hang.  That's very different than what we're used to.  Just zip through it, just to get to his, that's not a good shot of the set.  Wait till he's sitting with Ozzy and Sharon if he can. 
[03:11:00]  Look at the colors on that set.  It's fucking a beautiful orange, pastels.  Pastels.  And because he's overtly gay, so he can be kind of bitchy with you, but in a good way.  Not a nagging bitchy.  No, he's great, man.  No, it's not working today.  We can't get audio out of that damn thing.  Might have been when we threw the fucking phone out.  Stop looking at me when you have computer problems, fuckers.  We'll have to do that tomorrow, Jimmy, because we can't get audio.  But he's got a bright red couch, it's a hang, they're all sitting there talking, and I love 
[03:11:30]  his backdrop.  It is very English, but it's these weird colors, and people just look alive on his show.  And he always gets the best of the best.  The best, because it's like him, and who's the other guy, Jonathan Ross, but Graham Norton  is the fucking, he didn't translate here, they tried to replace Tough Crowd with him.  Didn't work.  But Ozzy was phenomenal on his show, like, I guess because Ozzy's very comfortable there,  and Sharon's very comfortable there, but God damn, was that a great interview. 
[03:12:00]  He's fucking, I cannot say enough about Graham Norton.  It looks very, um, Austin Powers, his set.  But doesn't it look like a...  Very colorful and groovy.  Who doesn't want to watch, like, if you turn this on, look at that beautiful studio and set,  you don't want to turn this off.  It's like, you just want to watch whatever's happening.  It's an amazing...  Lipstick red couch.  Yeah, the colors are beautiful, man.  And it's...  He's got one with 50 Cent there.  Let me see 50 Cent.  Everyone goes.  Wahlberg, he gets everybody. 
[03:12:30]  Every American...  That's a weird...  Oh, there's Jimmy Carr.  Jimmy Carr.  Yeah.  50 Cent Jimmy Carr on the same panel.  Like, he's just a weird fucking eclectic...  What a fucking Fitty.  People...  We had Fitty.  Yeah.  Is that Jimmy on there?  Yeah, it was fun.  Taking pictures of him.  Hmm.  Well, let's say...  It's a fun show, man.  Oh, man, is that a nightmare for me?  A white girl getting fucking...  Hugged by a big black guy.  Jesus.  He's just saying hello.  He was just taking a fun picture. 
[03:13:00]  He was on TV.  He just had his arm on her shoulder.  It was entertainment.  You don't have to fuck her.  I mean...  That's true.  She's already got dark hair.  You don't...  Let's not go outside the box today.  That's a fun show.  I can't stop talking about Graham Norton.  You like Jimmy Carter.  I do.  Jimmy's a great guy.  He had fun on his show last year in England.  Oh, I've never been over it.  He has a show called Nine Out of Ten Cats.  It's good?  Yeah, it was good.  I was not so hot on it, but...  Oh, no.  Why?  I don't know.  I think I would...  Oh, Russell, I'm sure you're being hot on your show. 
[03:13:30]  No, I was saying things, but I think it was lost in translation a little bit sometimes.  What is it?  I might have been mumbling.  Is it a topic discussion show?  Yeah, it's kind of...  But, you know, at the same time, you don't want to step on anybody's feet, and, you know,  you're like...  And then some other guy will be like, oh, all right, fuck it, you take it.  So, what was the other topic?  What was one of the topics?  I don't remember, to be honest with you.  It was a year ago.  Like, hats.  Might have been hats.  I'd go off on hats.  Yeah.  See, this show's great for me, because, you know, you can swear and talk like a gentleman.  Yeah.  Just fucking hang out.  Yeah.  And maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. 
[03:14:00]  This is like Graham Norton on the radio.  Oh, nice.  Look at that.  Except it's just everybody comes in.  Maybe it's because of his last name.  You like him.  Possible.  Ah, see.  So, why don't we make our studio more colorful?  Dude, it's just...  Because it'll freak Anthony out.  Well, the walls, maybe.  The walls are very black.  We'll lighten that up for you.  It's okay.  Let's get Russell out of here.  Russell, it was a pleasure, man.  Brooklyn, I can't believe you're playing the Barclays Center.  You're going to come?  Fuck yeah.  I love seeing you, man.  November 10th, at the Barclays Center, the first comic, and the fourth act... 
[03:14:30]  Justin Bieber is playing right after you.  Is he?  It's Russell Peters and then Justin Bieber.  So, who's first?  Jay-Z?  Jay-Z, I think.  Do this again.  And Madonna.  Madonna.  The Eagles.  And then Russell Peters.  And then Justin Bieber.  Wait, I think the Islanders versus the Devils.  Oh, well.  The Harlem Globetrotters.  Barbra Streisand.  Barbra Streisand.  Oh, they've started filling this fucking thing up way before me.  It was supposed to be...  Not very many.  It's like Jay-Z, Barbra Streisand, Rush, Journey. 
[03:15:00]  They're all massive acts.  And then Russell Peters is there.  It's Justin Bieber and then the Who.  Yeah.  Who, who, who, who, who.  Wow.  And Bob Dylan after that.  Go to Russell Peters.  It's R-U-S-S-E-L-L-Peters.com.  His dates, he's got one day coming up in December at the Staples Center in L.A.  San Jose, of course.  He'll be at the HP Pavilion.  And in Brooklyn, here in New York, November 10th, the Barclays Center.  Of course, which, when I come in for that, I'll hopefully drop in again here. 
[03:15:30]  Do you get a lot of our fans at your shows?  No, I get them on Twitter.  I mean, they may show up at the shows, but I don't know.  If our fans haven't seen Russell Peters, you're missing out.  He's amazing.  He really is.  And I'm pretty happy with the new set that I've got.  So, yeah.  So it's a good feeling, right?  And you finally put it together.  The last set, the green card, too, I didn't love.  But this one, I'm a fan of the new material.  Well, it's cool when you dump the material.  When the material goes bye-bye, there's nothing better than when you start working on a hunk.  But I work in 20-minute hunks at the Stupid Cellar or Caroline's, and it's like, they're not putting them together. 
[03:16:00]  There's always flops on itself for a while.  Well, we're all leaving, so let me just plug our gig, too.  Coming up, Opie and Anthony and myself will be in Chicago this weekend, this Friday.  What is the name of the place we're going to, Sam?  I don't have...  115 Bourbon Street.  115 Bourbon Street.  We're going to be doing the fucking Chip Contest, the Bring the Weirdest Thing You Own, Bad Breath Contest.  And the pig race.  Oh, and the pig race.  If any females want to email obanthony at SiriusXM.com, you can win $1,000. 
[03:16:30]  It's going to be very fun.  Saturday, August 11th, I will be with Artie Lang, Nick DiPaolo, and Dave Attell at the venue at the Horseshoe Casino, which Russell has done.  Great venue.  Saturday, August 25th, me and Dave Attell alone, Hampton Beach Casino, Blumenreich has been bugging me for years to do that room, so we're finally doing it.  Oh, yes, that little island gig?  Yes, I've never been up there.  And then myself, September 13th through 15th in Irvine at the Improv.  And that's about it.  I do have, coming up, Vancouver, Toronto, but that's not for me. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, my first Canadian gig of the year.  When are you going up there?  I'm doing Vancouver October 12th, the Rickshaw Theater, and then November 8th in Toronto, the Underground Cinema.  Whatever it is, it's a festival of some sort.  Oh, cool.  I'll help you with the Toronto one, at least.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, I would love to.  It's my city.  That's my hometown.  Let's take the show to Vancouver.  I've been there.  I told you they got blown in the alley.  I know I would love it.  Hot chicks, right?  Yeah, hot chicks.  Really hot chicks in Vancouver, actually.  I'm not mad at the vagina in Vag-couver. 
[03:17:30]  Vag-couver.  Russell Peters, everyone.  Thanks, Russell.  See you soon.  See you guys tomorrow?  All right.  Let's get out of here.  Oh, wait, wait.  You're not doing it right.  Oh, shit.  It's time to go home now.  Oh, come on.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head after Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next. </pre>
