<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties, followed by the hosts complaining about needing a vacation.  The conversation then moved to the recent gay pride parade, the desensitizing effect of the internet, and a lengthy discussion about the new iPhone, particularly its FaceTime feature, with numerous sexually explicit jokes about its potential misuse. They favorably compared the iPhone to BlackBerrys.  One host detailed his new video series, "Crazy Gun Guy Karaoke," explaining its production process and diverse audience reactions. The show covered the BET Awards, focusing on Chris Brown's emotional Michael Jackson tribute breakdown and the audience's response.  They also touched on Corey Feldmanâ€™s emotional Michael Jackson tribute, Kanye West's comeback, Bubba Watson's emotional golf victory, Dick Clark's Emmys appearance, the US World Cup loss to Ghana, and Fedor Emelianenko's disappointing UFC fight, all punctuated with sexually explicit comments and references.

The broadcast continued with a play-by-play of Fedor Emelianenko's MMA fight and speculation about the reasons for his loss.  This segued into crude jokes about Bubba Watson's emotional post-win interview and a homophobic rant against men wearing pink shirts.  A caller, Lydia, discussed her YouTube videos of herself singing with guns, leading to a shockingly graphic recounting of her past, including drug use, disposing of a body, and explicit details of sexual experiences.  The hosts, callers, and on-air personalities reacted with a mixture of shock, humor, and disbelief, further exploring Lydia's background as a clinical psychologist and the hypocrisy of her judging others.  The segment concluded with movie reviews of *Toy Story 3* and *Grown Ups* and more sexually charged banter.

A substantial portion of the show focused on a discussion of *Grown Ups*, particularly its fat jokes aimed at Kevin James,  analyzing its comedic merit and suitability for families.  The hosts debated the performances of the cast.  This transitioned into an audio recording of an interview with Al Gore's massage therapist detailing alleged sexually inappropriate advances by Gore, including explicit descriptions of his alleged actions. The hosts and callers reacted to the audio with commentary on Gore's behavior and the therapist's account.

The final segment heavily featured the Al Gore allegations, with graphic audio clips and explicit discussion of the accusations, including speculation on the timing and veracity of the claims.  A caller discussed their experiences with massage therapists and the blurring lines between professional massage and sexual acts, using explicit language. The show also covered news coverage of the Al Gore allegations,  the increase of interracial couples in Cheerios commercials, a video of a Ugandan official discussing homosexuality (with highly offensive and graphic descriptions and racist comments), a Supreme Court ruling on gun control, and Anthony's upcoming casino appearance.  The entire broadcast was rife with offensive jokes, crude humor, and highly inappropriate language across various topics.  While there were no named in-studio guests besides the hosts, callers participated throughout the broadcast.

[00:06:00]  and being social  with people  that are  not even near me  mm-hmm  more so than the people  that are near me  yeah you don't want to  we're all talking to each other  and other people  but you're at a gathering  you're not bothering  with the people right in front of you  no why bother  they're doing the same thing  you're socializing with people  from other states  and other areas  and they're doing the same thing  and it's not considered rude  by a lot of people  where do you  if you remember  when cell phones  first really started  and people would look down  you'd get really mad 
[00:06:30]  yeah you were at a restaurant  with somebody  you're absolutely right  you had to actually  if you got a call  you would actually  step away from the table  they'd be  excuse me  i have to take this  you'd get up from the table  go somewhere  so you wouldn't be on the phone  at the table  now at the table  you just  you're texting  you're talking  you look up  every once in a while  and go uh-huh  yeah uh-huh  it's not even rude  to not make eye contact  while someone's talking to you  because you're just texting  because they're doing  the same thing to you  these fucking iPhones  oh that's the table 
[00:07:00]  that was all of our iPhones  just thrown on the table  and all brand new ones  all brand new  I'm looking at five iPhones  brandy new  oh we were FaceTiming  for no reason  because we were ten feet away  and I'm hiding my BlackBerry now  like I can't even leave it out  I'm embarrassed  FaceTime  I'm embarrassed by my BlackBerry  yeah  Bob Kelly called me on FaceTime  and it was like we were lovers  he's on his pillow  he's on his fucking pillow  it was pillow talk  he's on his pillow  and I got mine propped up  on my bed  I'm on my computer 
[00:07:30]  and I'm looking at this  big dumb Colonel Kurtzhead  on his pillow  I would never talk to a guy  like that on the phone  why would you  never  no  but it's amazing  because you can  you do  it's fucking phenomenal  people are calling it  tit time  pussy time  and cock time  what about dump time  dump time too  anybody doing the dump time  with FaceTime  I've done it  call up  you FaceTime  first time I FaceTime  I checked  she was in my fucking living room  I'm in my fucking bathroom  you have to do it  I had a question for her  FaceTime  I'm on the toilet 
[00:08:00]  hey is the toast done  instead of doing something cool  like hey  I'm going to do FaceTime  from the Grand Canyon  you do it from your  fucking big hairy dump  I was also thinking  how parents could really  use that  because  you know  hey  at 9 o'clock  you will call me  and FaceTime me  and spin around  show me exactly  where you are  who you're with  what you're doing  it used to be  you know  you called from a pay phone  and was like  yeah I'm over at my friend's house 
[00:08:30]  where I said I'd be  yeah I fucking broke down man  I'll be home soon  yeah I'll be home soon  what  you want to see the car  yeah  now it's like  good show me the car  oh you said you were with  so and so  yeah  show me  yeah  go ahead  show me where you are  you're at the movies  show me  yeah  some people are going to be  in trouble out there  what about FaceTiming  like a movie  if you're just sitting  you're sitting at the movies  someone wants to watch  you just  well they're going to have to  figure all that out  FaceTime it  I mean  there was a time  remember you would go to 
[00:09:00]  a concert or something  and they would catch  you taking digital pictures  you would sneak in  a little fucking digital  yeah yeah sure  now they gave up on that  if you think about it  that used to be a huge  no-no to take a picture  of you too  or whoever your favorite  band is  put it right here  yeah  but now everyone just  pops up their cell phones  they can't stop that shit  yep  so they just accept it now  yeah  yeah because  it is weird  that it's still called  a phone  and it's not a camera  but the thing is  it's a better camera  than a lot of cameras  used to be  that's for sure 
[00:09:30]  so they can't really  confiscate it  it's your fucking phone  your life  it's your link  to the whole world  yeah we were talking  about this  and yeah Danny writes  up on the screen  new kid excuse  there's no wifi here  no wifi  at Johnny's house  and that'll work  for another year or two  and then that's gonna be  that's gonna go bye bye  that'll be done  you're just wondering  kids that are  growing up now  what the hell  they're gonna have to  contend with  and have  and stuff in the future  because I look at 
[00:10:00]  something like FaceTime  and think  that is finally  you know  video conferencing  we're not sitting  at home like it was  in the 50s and 60s  here's the futuristic  view of the  video phone  and they'd show  this giant box  on a table  and you have  the mother-in-law there  and they're talking  in their little  aprons  you know what  let's call it  let's make it official  when did they introduce  the video phone  and now in the year 2010  we finally officially  had the video phone  it's convenient  I know some people  have been Skyping 
[00:10:30]  and iChatting  and all that  but this is officially  the video phone  when was it  introduced  where they're saying  everyone's gonna  have one of these  oh my god  yeah we're looking  at old school  video phone pictures  a picture  doesn't look pretty  a giant old  cathode ray tube  TV  with what looks like  to be a 1950s  radio under it  and they're having  a little video chat  she's holding up  this microphone  K to K12  K to K1  it just looks  exhausting  for the poor lady 
[00:11:00]  yeah  and shouldn't she be  baking fucking cookies  or something  get dad's dinner ready  you fucking bitch  get that martini ready  get that nice dress  on of yours  and bake some  fucking cookies  you don't have time  to video chat  with your stupid  friend  she kind of is  because she's wearing  an apron  and there's a mixer  in this drawing  she's definitely  getting back to work  you can't have a woman  in a picture  without a mixer  unless she get on  that video phone  with a black eye  see those were the broads  that sort of deserved  the 50%  yeah exactly 
[00:11:30]  they did something  well no  because they had  no skills  I mean where are you  going to take  your baking skills  when your marriage  was over  yeah really  you weren't going  to take it  to another guy  because that was  not cool  to remarry  no  she's a hollet  yeah but now  we have like  handheld  video phones  yeah that's pretty  fucking amazing  it's pretty  god damn cool  yeah I'm embarrassed  to be in public  with my blackberry  at this point  a lot of people  I'm completely embarrassed  because it's a status 
[00:12:00]  thing you know that  it really is  kind of a  I got buttons  yeah buttons  I got buttons  and my screen's  half the size of yours  like this is embarrassing  Danny was ragging  Keith's wife and  saying something like that  like oh you have  a touch screen  but why does your phone  have buttons  yeah  and then Keith  we showed Keith  FaceTime  when he was going to work  and he just looked at it  and went  and walked away  he didn't say another word  he's not in the  iPhone world yet  no no 
[00:12:30]  he was very happy  although he did  finally get an iPad  and I think that's  going to be the thing  that puts him over the top  to make him  he loves it  to make him get rid  of that shitty storm  that he has  he hates that storm  I love my  MacBook Pro  so I mean  I am in that world  a little bit  but I'm not all in yet  video phone  1956  and finally in the year  2010 we could  officially say we have it  creating a new world  with electronics  how soon  will you be able  to see  over the phone 
[00:13:00]  and then they have  a guy  with his glasses  off in his hand  he's sitting there  a very businessman  looking guy  from the 50's  he's got a boner though  and he's got a cord  on the phone  which is the best part  well it's not even the cord  it's the rotary telephone  that's attached  to this video screen  it's a rotary telephone  he's got this camera  and again  a cathode ray tube  TV  black and white  and he's talking  to another businessman  who's trying to show him  something I guess  is he showing him 
[00:13:30]  something business oriented  or his cock  is it an Arab jacker  he's like pointing  to some picture  with like a pen  like he's giving  a presentation  the first Arab jacker  was 1956  1956  that's 54 years ago  we finally have it  and we finally got it  and it's handheld  and just wonderful  a tiny ass little cord  he's literally  a foot away  from the screen  he could not be  enjoying that chat  no  he has his glasses off  because he's going blind  and where is it  is it on the wall  is he just facing the wall 
[00:14:00]  yeah  Jimmy makes a good point  he's probably going blind  they don't have the screen  figured out in 1956  no  flickering  fucking black and white  terrible  going cross eyed  after you're done  but when the call's done  it goes down to a little dot  in the middle of the screen  that stays there for an hour  exactly  what was that  well good for you guys  I don't really feel like  talking about your stupid iPhones  look we did it  can we move on  because I'm fucking sad  I need something better  a lot of people  are very sad  Travis by the way  waited seven hours online 
[00:14:30]  to get his iPhone  seven hours  why didn't you hook him up  I tried  but he wanted it  I wasn't in the area  he wasn't in the area  oh okay  where were you  huh  where were you  well on Thursday  I had a family  a funeral thing to do  okay  so I wasn't able to  could have used the iPhone  you could have done some  I could have just  FaceTime  corpse time  so I wasn't in the area  on Thursday 
[00:15:00]  to be able to get it  so I had to do it on Friday  I hope you gave someone  a scolding  that you had to be at that  instead of getting your iPhone  well you know  things happen  you know  dude seven hours  that's crazy  I wouldn't have waited  seven hours  if I had known  it was going to be  seven hours  when I got into the line  it was about  a three hour line  the queue  but even three hours  is ridiculous  no three hours  look for a regular guy  like me  three hours  I can deal with  when the 3G came out  it was a three hour line  I was in the exact same spot 
[00:15:30]  where was this  it was the 5th Avenue  oh  which is the only place  that had them  up until this weekend  you picked the flagship store  yeah because they're  the only place  that had them  on Friday  everything else was sold out  they're sold out now  so I got into the line  and it was a three hour  the spot I was in  was the spot I was in  two years ago  and that took three hours  so I was like  alright  and then once two hours hit  I was like  this isn't going to take  three hours  this is going to take  a lot longer  a lot longer than that  but then at that point  I've already invested 
[00:16:00]  time that I can't leave  you know  so it ended up being  from the time I got in the line  to the time that I walked  out the door  it was seven hours  I would wait  seven hours on the line  for anything  that's insanity  yeah but now I have my phone  yeah but I had mine  in eight minutes  yeah but  and I had so many  pissed off people  looking at me  on that line  when I walked out  with the little  the little apple bag  with the blatant square  iphone box in it  you had the phone  in the box  no no  I had it in my hand  but then you also 
[00:16:30]  have the little  like the thing  with your old phone  in it  and I'm walking out  with the new phone  and people just looking  going  he just walked in  this motherfucker  just walked in  but Travis  why didn't you  just order it online  because uh  when  when it was  to be ordered  it was going to  ship on the 24th  and I knew  that we weren't  going to be here  on the 24th  because I was  going to be  at the funeral  funeral yeah  so there was  going to be  no one assigned  for it  oh  so  so you had  to do the  seven hours  yeah  so I did  yeah  all right  well  what are you 
[00:17:00]  going to do  I've never  waited that long  for anything  in my life  no that's crazy  I won't do it  again  are we still  talking about  the iPhone  what about  your shitting  and pissing  yeah  how do you  you didn't  piss for seven  hours  well he's a  young kid  his pump  is still  pretty strong  he's got a  strong pump  and a strong  sphincter muscle  I just didn't  think about it  that was  I just  kept it out  of my mind  what did you  do to keep  busy  you talk  to other  people  yeah  you make  friends  line  friends  they got  a stink  line  friends  suck

[00:22:00]  so  occasionally  I  would  go  downstairs  set  up  the  camera  by  my  karaoke  thing  and  grab  various  armaments  and sing  karaoke  with  different  weaponry  I  can only  pray  while you're  doing your  new  obsession  with these  videos  that  people  are  upstairs  just  fucking  ransacking  my house  just  completely  the alarm's  on  you have  no clue  because  you're  downstairs  being  an  internet  star  the alarm's  on  they  couldn't  possibly  just  walking  out  the  front  door  with  everything  that's  not nailed 
[00:22:30]  down  you have  no idea  I mean  when you  got the  alarm  on  I don't  have to  worry  about  that  and  like I  said  I am  armed  yeah  I'm  doing  my  karaoke  and  upstairs  they hear  you singing  fucking  hello  by  Lana  Rishi  they're  like  okay  we got  three  more  minutes  to get  this  shit  out  of  here  why don't  you have  a thing  of  like  I don't  even  know  what  it's  called  a thing  of  bullets  oh  a bandolier 
[00:23:00]  yeah  why don't  you do  that  a bandolier  because I  got  magazines  I'm  gonna  do  a  I'm  saying  for  the  visual  get a  thing  of  bullets  well I  think  I'm  gonna  do  that  with  my  six  shooters  when I  do  King  of  the  road  I'm  gonna  do  the  song  King  of  the  road  with  my  two  pistolero  pistols  and see  if I  can  spin  them  I  also  this  last  one  is  done  in  widescreen  HD  so  I  put  a  green  screen  up  behind  it  because  people  were  clamoring  clamoring  for a  green  screen 
[00:23:30]  so  that  they  could  pop  me  out  and  put  me  into  various  scenery  so  this  whole  thing  is  now  interactive  yeah  so  you  could  do  things  with  it  I  saw  one  a  little  advice  to  the  guy  you  need  better  keying  software  I  understand  the  background  the  green  screen  is  not  lit  perfectly  and  it  got  a  few  wrinkles  in  it  and  stuff  but  if  you  know  how  to  key  it  it  is  not  a  problem  wait  wait  wait  your  green  screen  is  as  wrinkled  as  your  clothes  you  couldn't  put  it  up 
[00:24:00]  there  nicer  for  the  people  I  stapled  it  to  the  top  of  the  wall  what  more  am I  going to  do  but  it  right  in  the  crease  of  the  wall  you  don't  even  see  it  you  don't  even  see  the  staples  when  they  come  out  and  if  you  don't  know  what  a  garbage  mat  is  don't  bother  see  you  gotta  be  able  to  clip  out  all  the  other  stuff  before  you  key  the  green  out  so  what  you  do  is  you  set  a  little  line  around  me  because  I  don't  move  I'm  staying  in  the  same  spot  so  you  just  garbage 
[00:24:30]  mat  all  the  shit  around  it  and  throw  it  out  make  that  transparent  and  then  you  key  out  just  the  green  around  me  and  then  you  can  pop  me  anywhere  but  why  don't  you  make  it  a lot  easier  to  have  a  green  screen  in  you  without  all  that  other  nonsense  is  what's  making  the  music  all  it  is  a  little  zoom  in  no  I  didn't  want  to  be  too  close  because  if I  was  too  close  you  couldn't  see  my  handy  dandy  low  Han Solo  holster  of course  so 
[00:25:00]  there's  a third  in the  series  now  up  there  yes  it's  Elton  John's  don't  let  the  sun  go  down  on  me  and  some  people  are  I  take  it  as  a  compliment  but  they're  complaining  that  I'm  lip  syncing  I'm  not  lip  syncing  Jesus  it's  like  I  could  hear  the  original  vocal  behind  it  shut  stop  they'll  always  just  be  assholes  fake  totally  fake  I was  just having  a conversation  with some  friends  yesterday  I would  talk about  like  online  people  and people  that comment  on your  twitter  and your  facebook

[00:27:30]  video  me  farting  into  so  perfect  well  I  got  so  excited  I  put  up  the  version  where  you  can  only  hear  it  the  hg  flip  and  I  finally  synced  it  up  with  the  show  so  there's  a  new  version  of  it  sounds  good  the  audio  sounds  much  excited  I  should  have  held  out  a  day  I  didn't  have  access  to  the  show  audio  at  home  believe  it  or not  the  audio  sounds  much  better  so  yeah  it  really  is  it  has  the  sound  of the  horn  it's  great  so 
[00:28:00]  I'm  just  saying  that  was  doing  real  well  as  well  we  got  some  nice  videos  out  there  for  everybody  to  check  out  plenty  of  videos  popping  up  the  video  Anthony  is  referring  to  is  just  a  guy  in  San  Francisco  I 
[00:28:30]  stars  everyone  doing  it  who's  doing  your  production  work  I  did  my  own  oh  you  did  that  you  used  iMovie  rules  for a quick  little  thing  you want  to put  some  quick  graphics  in  it  was  more  about  trying  to  work  with  iMovie  than  anything  else  I  had  no  comprehension  and I  finally  gave it  and watched  the  tutorial  and in  five minutes  I was  like  that's  it  it  makes  it  so  easy  I  couldn't  believe  how  I 
[00:29:00]  avoided  it  I  thought  I  couldn't  do  it  but  I  did  a  little  production  before  and  after  not  much  you  don't  really  need  much  though  because  the  guy  is  great  on  his  graphics  that  fly  in  look  great  they  got  like  a  motion  blur  to  them  and  they  slow  down  and  cross  each  other  they  do  a  very  good  job  with  that  movie  last  night  we  had  the  BET  awards  I  know  who  cares  but  there's  a  couple  good  clips  worth  playing  because 
[00:29:30]  you  had  Corey  Feldman  he's  still  hurting  over  Michael  Jackson  still  hurting  Chris  Brown  broke  down  and  cried  on  the  BET  awards  how  bad  I  didn't  watch  him  I'm  not  even  going to  make  believe  I  watched  this  fucking  thing  is  he  going  to  be  thrown  out  of  the  community  no  the  girls  supposedly  are  loving  Chris  Brown  because  he  broke  down  women  are  coming  out  the  woodwork  they  want  to  have 
[00:30:00]  his  baby  what's  wrong  with  the  women  well  going  back  to  of  course  me  I've  noticed  that  from  doing  these  stupid  videos  a lot  of  girls  actually  say  wow  that  is  sexy  singing  with  guns  oh  really  like  who  are  these  fucking  lunatics  they're  out  there  they  really  are  crazy  oh  we  know  you're  out  there  yep  so  what's  going on  with  Chris  Brown  he  breaks  down  cries  on  the  BET  awards  and  then  women  are 
[00:30:30]  applauding  him  in the  audience  yeah  he did  a  Jermaine  Jackson  came out  and said  you know  it's been  a year  blah blah  blah  well  god damn  Germans  got  nothing  to do  with it  it's been  a year  since we  killed  our  brother  so we  could  all  live  very  well  well  it was  like a  big  that's  a joke  I have  no  fucking  idea  but I  did  learn  that  his estate  made close  to a billion  dollars  in the  first year  after his  death  unbelievable  way more  money than  if he was  alive 
[00:31:00]  Latoya  thinks he  was murdered  for his  back  catalog  does she  really  yeah  I would  take her  seriously  she's done  nothing but  speak logically  over the years  that's right  way to go  way to stick  up for  you're right  do you see  the special  when she  met up  with Bubbles  the chimp  oh  that's my  answer  is emotional  people say  watch the  Chris Brown  thing  it's a  fucking  disaster  why is  it a  fucking  disaster  because  it was  like a  big deal 
[00:31:30]  he was  like  there's  one  person  who  hasn't  gotten  to do  his  Michael  Jackson  tribute  and here  he is  because  before all  the controversy  people  thought of  Chris Brown  as a  young  Michael  Jackson  the way  he  danced  oh  and so  who are  these  people  that  thought  that  the people  who  that's  what  people  thought  he'd  moon  punch  slug him  in the  face  his  favorite  song  was  beat  her  beat  her  there's  a  p.y.t  punch  your  tits  there's 
[00:32:00]  a  thriller  joker  there  as well  Jesus  I thought  Usher  was the  young  Michael  Jackson  yeah  what  happened  that  young  anymore  oh  man  you know  who  is  huge  right  now  fucking  Drake  motherfucker  Drake  is  the  shit  fucking  Drake  right  now  is  the  number  one  album  shit  nobody  can  touch  him  hell  yeah  I say  and I  put the  S on  the end  of hell  good  he did  this  whole  shit  he didn't  even  have  an  album  out  yeah  what  the  fuck  yo  he did  it  with  a  mixtape  it's  amazing  wonderful  so what  happened  with  Chris  Brown  well 
[00:32:30]  uh  I don't  know what  that is  nice  video  Danny  two young  shirtless  black  children  dancing  they're  listening to  the new  Drake  album  that  I swear  looks like  District  9  Jesus  sorry  so what  happened  so he  came out  he did  you know  he danced  and danced  and danced  and then  they played  this montage  of like  I think  it was  people in  Haiti  and animals  covered in  oil  and then  he came  on to  sing  Man in  the Mirror  and he  started  he couldn't 
[00:33:00]  he couldn't  get it out  at all  he started  crying  and eventually  just put  the mic  down  completely  what  and he  was  bawling  and they  had  a  really  like  bawling  what a  fruit  on live  TV  yeah  and then  we got  this audio  yeah  and then  all the  girls  started  going  like  oh my  like  they  panned  to the  crowd  and the  girls  in the  crowd  were like  oh my  god  I  started  rapping  with  two  bad  knees  from  18  years  ago  I left  Dayton 
[00:33:30]  Ohio  with  two  very  bad  knees  I  know  I  know  I  dream  to  become  a  major  league  baseball  player  what  happened  what  happened  I  thank  god  it  dream  came  true  all right  enough  I'll go  home and  get your  fucking 
[00:34:00]  shine box  so  right baby  so they  had to pull  out our  heart strings  by showing  fucking  oil covered  fucking  animals  in Haiti  really  the words  of michael  live on  and can  be reflected  in today's  track  oh he's  doing like  a  he came out  and did all  the dancing  who's that  that's chris brown  ew  from the  BET awards  because he  used to  dance  just like  michael  wait he  jumped on  a car  like michael  jackson  he's doing  like the  video 
[00:34:30]  so when  does he  cry  after he  dances  and you  got that  audio over  here  you bet  or do we  play it  over there  look at  him dancing  yo  see  alright he's  dancing like  michael jackson  is he singing  or lip syncing  or what is he  doing  this is lip  syncing  yeah  I assume  anytime I see  someone dancing  really hard  with a headset  mic  right  I'm like  that's all  fucking  lip sync  didn't he beat  the shit  out of a broad  beat up  rihanna  really badly  and now just a  little time has  to go by  and he's back  right where he  was  he bit her  he bit her  yeah  he has 
[00:35:00]  violent  tendencies  oh yeah  yeah  so why  did we  why the fuck  did we have to  sit out two  years  we didn't  fucking bite  no chick  or punch her  well which one  of you two  can dance  like that  that's true  good point  Sam  alright now  now  he's done  dancing  he's done  dancing  no he's not  you think he  might be  oh  oh  oh hells  y'all  wow look  they're wearing  like glow in the  dark pants  and hats  alright this 
[00:35:30]  clip's really  long  should we  cut to the  Chris Brown  it is long  after he  danced  this is how  he went  down  I guess  he had to  reflect upon  his own  oh this is  now him  singing  and the  time  his wind is 
[00:36:00]  blowing  my heart  do we  his sensitive  side  when he's not  beating  pretty girl  I'm looking 
[00:36:30]  at the fist  in the grill  and he gave  up  he gave up  he put the  mic down  and he just  started singing  like yelling  on stage  inaudibly  and the  girls loved  it  I mean  twitter was  going crazy  everybody's  forgiving  Chris Brown  the girls  loved it  it's a  it's a  better visual  but he  completely  breaks down  I definitely  yeah the  girls in the  audience are  definitely 
[00:37:00]  pulling a  CO  yeah  what's a  CO  I just  use initials  these days  oh I know  what that  means  yeah  look it up  what's a  CO  I can't  say  yeah  yeah  it's on  it's on  certain websites  what kind  of a  fucking  faggot  is this  going to  cry  like  what  ch  instead of  c  no yeah  yeah  it's called  CO  yeah  what's the  C stand  well the  last word  is out  right  so  the first  word is  this  oh 
[00:37:30]  people  people saying  he copped  out  because he  forgot the  lyrics  really  maybe  I don't  think he  forgot the  lyrics  I mean  they had  to bleed  him off  the stage  yeah he  didn't forget  the lyrics  get the  fuck out  of here  it's one of  Michael Jackson's  biggest hits  how could Chris  Brown forget the  lyrics  it's all  fake  well I mean  I'm sure  that he  manufactured some  tears trying to  get some  sympathy  this totally  fixes everything  he did 
[00:38:00]  because he's  been working  on sympathy  ever since  it happened  he did a  concert to  benefit the  census  saying that  you know  he's just  whatever he  can benefit  the census  yes  Jesus  that's what he  said he was  doing with  Rihanna  he was just  counting  and he went  one  I counted  that bitch's  teeth  you have to  mark them  so you don't  count them  twice  Kanye West  had a big  comeback last  night too  what did he  do  he performed  his new 
[00:38:30]  single  he's got a  new album  coming out  it's going  to be fire  again  is he  oh yeah  he's going  to be great  he's going  to be right  back on top  you're a hit  you can tell  the hits  Kanye West  is back  he's good  though  he's an ass  but he is  very good  at what he does  we all know  he's good  at what he does  but he is a  complete asshole  Corey Feldman  still hurting  what's this about  that was at  some non-televised  Michael Jackson  memorial  oh he wasn't  invited  I thought this was  on the BET  award  I thought this  was just a  continuation of 
[00:39:00]  the BET awards  it was some  just lame  tribute  that wasn't  televised  Corey Feldman  is not going  to go to  the BET awards  why  he'll get  the sandman  will come  sweep him  right off  the sandman  he's not  going to be  there  so the anniversary  of Michael  Jackson's death  was Friday  I believe  yeah  okay so you  would think  that Corey  Feldman would  be a big get  who got him  who got him  it was some  memorial  this is camcorder  footage  from the venue  this sounds so bad  it looked like  it was in a banquet  hall  so he couldn't 
[00:39:30]  even get on  a real media outlet  no  for the year  anniversary  of Michael  Jackson's death  wow  wow  that is sad  wow  alright here's  camcorder footage  of Corey Feldman  hurting a year later  Michael and I  were friends  oh my god  he's at a high  school gym  yeah  there's nobody  there  listen to the  audio  it's just a big  echo  I thought  it was CNN  or something  oh no  no  oh my god  he wasn't televised  wow he can't  even get on  on real TV 
[00:40:00]  maybe he prefers  to deal privately  yeah I guess  Michael and I  were friends  really close friends  for about 18 years  and the reason  I say 18 years  is because  it was 8 years  before he passed  away that him  and I didn't speak  we had a bit  of a falling out  and when we  great job  I can never  ever let go  of the fact  that I didn't  get a chance  to say goodbye 
[00:40:30]  or give Michael  a hug  or tell him  again that I  loved him  so I'm taking  that opportunity  right now  to say Michael  oh shut up  shut the fuck up  I forgive you  I hope you forgive me  and I love you  get you  fucking home  in private  you bore  he's dead  right  exactly  what was it  falling out  you grew  hair on your  dick  he said  I'm straight  kiddo  if he was  holding strong  to not talk  to Michael  anymore  that was some  serious shit 
[00:41:00]  going down  yeah  so what  happened  Corey  yeah  yeah  if you forgive  him why don't  you dig him  up and give  him a hug  I had somebody  put me with  Hitler  that isn't a  request  I was just  commenting  someone keyed me  out of the  green screen  version  of the  Elton John  song and put  me right next  to Hitler  giving a speech  those are actually  Hitler's friends  doing it as a  goof  oh he's got 
[00:41:30]  he's got the  sound too  with the music  it's Hitler  and me  I'm a 
[00:42:00]  Nuremberg  too late  to save  myself  from falling  that's great  sounds good  man  thank you  Jimmy  I took a  chance  I mean the  cheers for you  yeah exactly  that's a  sound  Hitler  giving the  Hitler salute 
[00:42:30]  and actually  looks too  heavily armed  to be with  that group  oh more  Hitler  they're all  waving at  Anthony  you're a  teen idol  and  saying  behind  by  don't let 
[00:43:00]  the sun  go down  on me  although I  search myself  it's always  someone else  I see  that guy did  a great job  with it  yeah  to walk  to free  for losing  everything  is that the  sun 
[00:43:30]  going down  on me  that guy did  a great job  it's me  in Nazi  Germany  crowd shots  and everything  you're on the  roof with  Hitler  you by  yourself  wow  very good  job  it's different  from the  BET awards  just a tad  yeah  that audience  was better  behaved  Jesus  who did  that  gotta give  that guy  some credit  oh fuck 
[00:44:00]  you  damn  that's pretty  good  that was  by  low  RDR  so low  writer  but RDR  low  RDR  Vato  V-A-T-O  good job  fucking tweet  that shit  so people  can check  it out  yeah  alright  you know  what  fuck  why don't  we take  our first  break  cause we  gotta talk  about  Bubba  Watson  breaking  down  a lot  of people  were crying  like a  bitch  who's Bubba  Watson  golfer  PGA  he won  the tournament  over the weekend  and completely  broke down  and also  Dick Clark  Jesus Christ 
[00:44:30]  anyone watch  the Emmys  I know  why would  you  but  Regis  was hosting  so I  said to  myself  I know  this is  gonna be  bad  I like  searching  out bad  stuff  on purpose  and I  wasn't  disappointed  Regis  sucks  as a  host  of a  fucking  TV  show  he's  just  not  very  relevant  it's  horrible  and then  they did  a tribute  to Dick  Clark  and Dick  Clark  broke  the fuck  down  so I  quickly  reached for  my  BlackBerry  I'm like  I'm gonna  tweet  something  witty  about this  and then  I just  got sad  and I  put my  BlackBerry  down  I didn't 
[00:45:00]  tweet  nothing  something  something  I was  like  you know  what  what  am I  doing  too  sad  what  am I  doing  did you  feel guilty  about using  a real  man's  heartache  as your  social  networking  joke  I was  all excited  I had a  couple good  thoughts about it  and then I'm  like what  are you  doing  this is  really just  fucking  depressing  yeah  that's  breaking  down  his wife  had to  help  him  and  Ryan  Seacrest  got in  there  to lap  his ass  one more  time before 
[00:45:30]  he passes  I guess  fucking  Ryan  Seacrest  he's  taking that  whole thing  over  oh I  know  he basically  said that  in front  of him  I think  that's why  Dick Clark  was breaking  down  yeah  yeah  he's just  waiting  and they  had like  they had  like fake  tan on  Dick Clark  so he  looks kind  of good  and that  looked awkward  and  America's  oldest  teenager  did a  long montage  of American  Bandstand  and all  these people  thanking him  and if it  wasn't for  him they  wouldn't be  big  stars  today  like someone 
[00:46:00]  like I don't  know Barry  Manilow  basically  thanking Dick  Clark for  his fucking  break  and he  couldn't even  and then he's  just sitting  there just  crying  uncontrollably  and was he  like was he  like stroke  crying  he actually  talked a little  bit and took  a couple shots  at Ryan  Seacrest  and it was  you know  he's still  witty  yeah  he really  is  and the  stroke  hasn't gotten  worse  or the  effects of  it  right  okay  he's  he's  about  where  we  last  you know 
[00:46:30]  looked at  him  yeah  from not  being able  to count  from 10  to 1  so I'm like  what are you  going to tweet  about this  I'm like  what is  wrong with you  yeah  I'm like  yeah I'm not  going to tweet  about this  I'm actually  really sad  maybe it's like  yeah I'm not  on the show  on the show  right now  maybe I  maybe I  should show  another emotion  on Twitter  and just  write yeah  I'm sad  by this  Dick Clark  thing  there are  times you  do things  and you  go like  I'm not  on the show  right  I can  understand  if I  was  maybe  the rest  of the  degenerates  on this  program  but  am I  really  garbage  yeah  maybe this 
[00:47:00]  is a good  opportunity  to show  another emotion  I was thinking  what are you  doing  alright  so can we  get maybe  some of  the Regis  monologue  in the  beginning  it was  horrendous  and then  he's talking  was he trying  to make  jokes  yeah  yeah  like  chip  he was  trying to  do  like  relevant  jokes  and they  were a  little  short  they were  like  a little  just  missed  they would  have been  relevant  maybe  five  six  years 
[00:47:30]  ago  that  fucking  old  ago  you know  what I  mean  I thought  maybe  he was  going to  bring  up  a  Lady  Gaga  joke  his  reference  points  are  just  a little  too  old  how  about  that  pebble  great  phone  so maybe  we'll have  some of  that  but  Bubba  Watson  definitely  after the  break  and also  this is  Al Gore's  masseuse  is talking  oh yeah  we got  16  fucking  these  fucking  whores  cannot  keep  their  mouths  shut  fucking  clips  they just  see the  money in 
[00:48:00]  it now  when you're  the VP  or the  former  vice  president  it's  amazing  that it  took  this  long  and what  is this  this is  her talking  to the  cops  yeah  she read  her statement  to police  there's some  good stuff  and then they  released the  entire thing  there's good  stuff  in here  I still don't  like the fact  that the  man is  named  and she  is not  until he's  proven guilty  right  because that  fucking  it does hurt  a woman's  reputation  sexual assault  and allegation  I understand  that  but being  accused  of rape  or sexual  misconduct  fucking  ruins a  man  and it's  like how  about 
[00:48:30]  until he's  guilty  you're not  allowed  to release  his name  because  if he's  innocent  you know  most people  aren't going to  pay attention  to that part  of this whole  story  it's already  out there  everyone is  protected  but alleged  perpetrators  who at times  are innocent  yep  absolutely  alleged  with that  we'll take a  break  and we'll get  into some  of this  other stuff  next  and now  the Opie and  Anthony show  is now back  on the virus  Sirius XM 
[00:49:00]  kicks in right  here  so I guess  we could all  go back to  not giving a  shit about  soccer  right  I was thinking  the same  thing  driving in  that's one  of the  headlines  and don't  even go  no but  this time  shut up  we go back 
[00:49:30]  to not  giving a  shit about  soccer in  this country  how short  did the U.S.  fall  how many  levels  how many  teams are  left  how far  did we come  that's a good  question  I mean we did  alright  they lost in  the round of  16 teams  so then I guess  there would be  down to 8  the 8  and then 4  then 2  so we lost  to Ghana  2-1 over the  weekend  Ghana  was it a legit  loss or was there  a lousy call  on it  there's been a lot  of lousy calls  but I think  in that game  it was legit  right  yeah I think  it was legit 
[00:50:00]  why am I  asking you  I watched  the game  but I don't  know what  I saw  I don't  know what  you saw  no I don't  know if I'm  watching a good  soccer game  I really don't  you don't know  what makes  a good one  I mean what  makes just  a regular one  I can tell you  when I'm looking  at a really good  hockey game  and people still  try to beat me  up they're like  this is way  better than your  stupid hockey  I'm like  I don't know  man I haven't  heard a really  good argument  to prove that  yet  I don't know  about that  so but the  world cup's  still going on  I guess  but the United 
[00:50:30]  States are out  and we're out  and did it  help the  sport in this  country  maybe a  smidge  I'll give it  a smidge  it's a smidge  more popular  yeah  that's what  they want to  hear  it's a smidge  more popular  in America  is this true  any time  one person  yes  like breaks  away  oh okay  what happened  and goes  and goes  against the  goalie  and they  just happen  to be like  one guy  and the  goalie  that it  always goes  in the  net  it has to 
[00:51:00]  the goal  is a city  block long  of course  but getting  to that  point  it takes  forever  it takes  forever  it's exhausting  turn off the  phones  I'm not  talking about  soccer today  with you  dummies  done  I would have  talked  I would have  humored you  if the  United States  were still  in it  but now  they're gone  and no one  gives a  flying fuck  about soccer  look they're  steaming out  there  I can feel  that  you still  care  there's this  one  and now  they'll mention  like teams  no one cares  about  right  the Nazis 
[00:51:30]  beat up  on the  limeys  huh  yeah  yes  yes  Germany  eliminates  England  I just  knew that  one  in other  sports news  what the hell  we'll do  a very quick  sports break  here  actually one  more item  worth mentioning  Fedor  he tapped out  after a minute  and a half  I think  over the weekend  wow  Fedor is the  big get  Dana White  wanted Fedor  so bad  in the UFC  he probably  still wants  him in the UFC  but probably  not as much  as he did 
[00:52:00]  a week ago  Fedor looked fat  dude he looked  really bad  for that level  of fighting  he looked  terrible  yes  can I see  that picture  of him  Denny  or no  you can see  I mean  for that  he got caught  I mean  he knocked  the guy  knocked  toward him  down  and he  just got  caught  in that  triangle  and he got  fucking  arm barred  is his leg  wrapped around  his head  yeah  he tapped  he don't  tap  just one  slap to the  leg  you could tell  he didn't  want to tap  but his arm 
[00:52:30]  was going to  fucking break  if he didn't  damn it  wow  so this will  either motivate  him to win  eight straight  fights  or he's done  it's hard  to say  because I don't  know what the  guy  you can't tell  anything by  fucking  listening to  him talk  so you can't  tell if this  will motivate  him now  just to come  back and start  really fighting  or if he's  just getting  out of the  fight game  to run  for this  thing  in Russia  did he fuck  up  well Mars  Mars watched  the whole fight  where is Mars  I think he did  but he also  knocked him down  oh yeah  yeah yeah yeah 
[00:53:00]  did you read it  or was it  I was on  Showtime  oh okay  that's how  Strikeforce  I don't think  can do real  big pay-per-views  so they're on  Showtime  well that's  that's  you know  but Fedor does  knock him down  but this fight  is very very  quick  it is huh  yeah it was  unbelievable  they're doing  a little dance  yeah Wordham  throws a kick  and misses  a little kicking  we'll do a little  play-by-play  Jimmy  they're just  kind of facing  off  no one's  throwing any  punches yet  nothing's really  happening yet  20 seconds  they're just  kind of both  faking a little  bit  feeling each 
[00:53:30]  other out  boom  oh there we go  Fedor knocks him  down  he falls back  now Fedor jumps  on to fucking  pound  and that's what he  does  he wants to  beat  he's beating  the shit  out of this  guy right  now  but the guy  is a Brazilian  world champion  in jiu-jitsu  yep  oh man  he got him  oh damn  look at this 
[00:54:00]  guy's got  like this  figure four  leg lock  around his  neck  Fedor can't  get out of it  Fedor can't  get out of it  he's also got  his arm  now he's  pulling his  arm back  and he had a  tap  oh he's not  happy  Fedor's like  fuck  wow  that was fast  holy shit  that little  motherfucker  had him tied  up  like a pretzel  that guy's a  great fighter  but Fedor  just  he just got 
[00:54:30]  caught  it happens  I mean  even on this  level  it's like  you make  one little  mistake  yeah  and that's  it's amazing  it hasn't  happened to him  sooner  and he got  in there  fucking  beating the  shit out  of him  I wonder  if this  guy  fucking  if this  word of him  had watched  enough Fedor  fights  and seen  what he  does  which is  when you  go down  he's an  animal  he just  jumps on  you  and pounds  and then  fucking  hammer fists  and I  wonder  if this  guy  had watched  that  enough  and said  if I  get him  in this  position  he's  leaving  himself  open  to be  fucking  triangled  and arm  bar  I bet  you're  on to  something  this guy's 
[00:55:00]  a world champion  and said  look I'll take  a couple  hits  but I'll  know  he'll  be  vulnerable  he will  come in  while I'm  on the  ground  and because  you don't  want to  stand up  with him  and get  punched  by him  no  but I  wonder  this  guy's  a two  time  world  champion  I  wonder  he waited  too long  to get  out  and when  he thought  he could 
[00:55:30]  get out  that's  a six  four  foot  motherfucker  on you  that's  a world  champion  you're not  going to  get away  from this  leg  but he  could have  gotten up  at one  point  but he  waited  a little  too  long  that's  why  I  think  it  was  ring  rust  how long  has it been  to do  in the  ring  it's been  a while  but he  looked like  he put  weight  on  and maybe  he didn't  train  as hard  for this  guy  as he  should  have  I  don't  know  he's  only  33  I  thought  Vito  was  older  but he's  only  33  he could  have  a few  good  years  left  in the  UFC  yeah  alright  we gotta  go this  guy in  Staten  Island  he's  slightly  pissed  at 
[00:56:00]  Jimmy  Angelo  slightly  what I  loved  before  is  you  saying  defending  Al Gore  it sounded  like  you're  trying  to make  sure  that  in the  future  if  anything  like  that  ever  happens  to  you  your name  might not  get  released  you sounded  like  a lawyer  getting  ready  to  protect  yourself  nah  dude  I'm  telling  you  my  name  released  I've  written  books  talking  about  my  filth  what I  mean  is  I'm  not  talking  about  perversion  dude  I'm  talking  about  sexual  charges  like 
[00:56:30]  illegal  stuff  rape  things  that ruin  your  life  and  my  problem  is  not  a  rapist  name  being  released  I  think  rapist  should  be  shot  it's  the  fact  that  when  you  didn't  do  it  that's  a  problem  because  your  name  is  all  over  the  place  and  the  woman's  is  not  so  it's  like  why  is  your  name  all  over  the  place  when  there's  such  a  stigma  attached  to  even  being  accused  no  I  agree  Jimmy 
[00:57:00]  get  out of  here  did  you hear  that  or  was  I  just  thinking  we're  going to  get to  that  audience  a little  bit  the  masseuse  is  speaking  we got  her  police  statement  but  to wrap  up  the  sports  Bubba  Watson  it's  PGA  shit  a lot  of  people  are  not  big  golf  fans  I  understand  that 
[00:57:30]  I  don't  have  the  backstory  in  this  maybe  a  golf  fan  does  he's  a  cry  baby  yeah  I  didn't  think  this  Bubba  Watson  was  a  cry  baby  type  of  guy  but  maybe  maybe  there  was  something  going  on  you know  that  I  don't  know  about  oh  one  of  those  maybe  I  did  this  for  somebody  that  recently  has  passed  away  or  something  I  wish  my  dad  was  here  you know  something  I  don't  know  who's  the  grand  marshal  of the  gay  parade  he's  in  a  soldier  gay  by  birth  soldiers 
[00:58:00]  by  choice  it's  some  like  Asian  soldier  guy  he's  sitting  on a  mortar  tube  that's  America  but  Bubba  Watson  did this  after he  won  yesterday  we all  knew  you had  it in  you  did  you ever  expect  an  afternoon  like this  no  I just  gotta say  thanks to  my mom  and dad  without  them  I'm  nothing  my dad  is battling  cancer  right now  dad  I'm  praying 
[00:58:30]  for  you  congratulations  on your  first win  alright  that's  what it  was  that's  what got  him  imagine  if he  said  without  them  I'm  nothing  if the  guy  said  well  technically  with  them  you  are  too  tiger  didn't  stick  his  dick  in  400  women  you  wouldn't  be  winning  this  boob  well  there's  a few  tournaments  where  the  big  guys  you  know  they  take  the  weekend  off  although

[01:04:30]  look clay just a  little bit a little  bit sit up a little  bit let's do that for  the people lydia wants  to talk about your gun  videos amp oh everybody  everybody was saying  that uh this is a cry  for lydia that i'm  doing cries for help  sad that i'm alone in  my basement making  videos let me let me  set this up by doing  this before and and  also i i would like  to say um some  people just don't get  it it's a little odd  they're like yeah you  should do more rockin  tunes with the guns 
[01:05:00]  it's like don't do you  understand that that to  me would be really kind  of creepy yeah it's  creepy enough but it's  creepy in a way that  you're supposed it's  supposed to be a  sappy dumb song with  the the guy holding  guns it doesn't work  it doesn't work if  it's actually rockin  to it right then it  just looks like you  know scary the beauty  of it it's it's a  sensitive song with  like touching yes  yes sensitive uh 
[01:05:30]  lydia hold on for one  second because uh  eric got the clip of  where crazy gun guy  originated from oh it  was june 9th june 9th  june 9th only a couple  weeks ago okay i was in  long-term relationships my  entire life and i'm  finally able to like just  be alone at my house yet i  have to find things to  do and i don't just  want to watch tv so i  find myself uh  occasionally down in my  basement which is a bar  area singing loudly on  the karaoke machine in my  shorts with a pistol on my 
[01:06:00]  hip just hoping a neighbor  complains and i just i know  i'm alone but i'm wondering  how disturbing this looks to  maybe dead relatives that  are looking in on me even  that thought i worry about  i mean this sounds like  after the atomic bomb went  off behavior you got a lot  of guns you're singing to  yourself on a karaoke machine  the guy in the basement  where he keeps his dead  relatives i'm telling you  put up a video and start  posting it on youtube i 
[01:06:30]  think within a month you'll  be seriously i'll be a  sensation i can guarantee  it i might have to do that  tonight i think find a hat  we may have to do costuming  a wacky hat i actually have  a nazi helmet perfect we  win we don't even have to  put it on coming this fall  that'll be a lot of fun just  label everything crazy gunman  crazy gunman don't use your  real name dude look it's 
[01:07:00]  crazy gunman's new video i  love this guy response to  crazy gunman i love him  oh i'm gonna do crazy with a  k great oh yeah can i make  that backwards are because  that's good too crazy with a  k and a backwards are i'll  look forward to it if i was  you i would be if i was you  i wouldn't listen to ron a  fez today because you're gonna  get a beating for not  acknowledging that ron basically  came up with crazy gunman  ron ronnie and you changed  it a little bit to crazy crazy  guy and lewis black came up  with the k for crazy yeah and 
[01:07:30]  and and lewis colin quinn had  nothing to do with this colin  had not one thing take his name  off your videos not one thing  to do with it colin all you  brought was the gun and the  mental illness yes yeah cuz  lewis was the one said i i  should put it on youtube and  ronnie b ronnie b named it yes  don't even use your name wow  go crazy gunman that by the  way sounds better than crazy  gun guy crazy gunman yeah but  it's too late to change but  gunman sounds like gunman which 
[01:08:00]  sounds like you're oh you're  saying that going out to do  bad so you're saying what ronnie  came up with isn't good enough  well all right you deal with  it was good fodder have fun  have fun with that fodder uh  lydia from oceanside wants in  on this fucking thing this is  great lydia talk to anthony i'm  obsessed with this video now oh  you're obsessed i have watched  it about 10 times i heard you  guys talking but i hadn't seen  it which one i heard that too  which one you know there's there's 
[01:08:30]  three in the collection  i meant i heard you the other  day talking about the video yeah  and it would be perfect for me to  sort of sink my teeth into but i  hadn't seen it so i didn't want to  say anything and then i went and  watched it and then i watched it  again and then i watched it all  weekend  and oh i am just obsessed with  crazy gun guys see you like it  right now you see nothing uh as as 
[01:09:00]  now a professional you see nothing  wrong with this right  i didn't say that  oh it's disturbing but incredibly  beautiful incredibly addictive i just  can't stop watching that the color of  the wall and the color of the wall it's  like a mustard yellow i didn't he  forgot to white balance his camera  the drunk i didn't white balance my  shitty camera and then the last one i  used my good camera and i finally  dragged it out of the studio and use  that one peachy and glowy and the 
[01:09:30]  music is all sweet and wonderful and  you're standing there i keep looking for the guitar  and you have an ak-47 yes see that's why it  works it is really um haunting it's really  apropos and the uh not to not to forget  the nostromo shirt from alien that  danny was kind enough to get me for i  believe my birthday uh also people  commenting i'm a little behind the 
[01:10:00]  scenes on some of these videos  i'll be some people commenting that uh  why am i dressed like john locke uh  with my pants up so high i'm wearing a  shoulder holster ring  why is your walls yellow they're not  that's he forgot to white balance my  camera okay that's the mustard yellow i was  talking about so it kind of works though  with the video the shoulder rig i'm  wearing hooks onto my belt and it really  is uh it was tight so it pulls the pants  up high so i i had to um yeah i look like 
[01:10:30]  john locke but that kind of works with the  video too yeah it's like it doesn't matter  what i'm fucking wearing who cares i'm  gonna try one in boxer shorts is it deeply  disturbing or is it slightly alluring  hey it's entertaining  lydia uh we'll we'll talk about this in a  second but uh who was the guy that touched  you when you were what nine or ten i forgot  his name  irving irving irving irving are you on the line irving good morning lydia have you grown 
[01:11:00]  since the last time i've seen you yes i have irving yes giant tits  irving so you wouldn't be interested irving what do you got i wondered if she's wearing her bathing  suit like i used to measure her when her bathing suit was on and i just wanted to see if she's been thinking about me  irwin wears pink on his finger  lydia does uh this creep you out hearing from the old guy 
[01:11:30]  uh yeah i think about him he can rest assured i think about him every day  you think about him every day  every day  he fucked you up  in my innocent life  he fucked you up that bad huh  oh it was pretty bad  wow  jeez that is pretty fucking severe  yeah  every day  do you miss me lydia  absolutely not  oh god damn  this is so creepy  what a ghoul i know what a creep this guy is 
[01:12:00]  every day lydia thinks of you  that's why she tries to help others because she couldn't help herself  is that it  oh i never thought of it that way but probably  of course  i always thought that we psychologists are battling our own issues absolutely and work them out  helping other people  mhm  lydia you're too hard on yourself you are a good girl  a really good girl  thank you  you're one of his favorites  oh my god even when it's a bit i want to choke on it 
[01:12:30]  oh yeah you choke on it all right  aww that's terrible  did irving lose his rider today because he's really not adding to this too much  it's just a creepy fucking line here and there  all right anything else sir  is it irwin or irving  irving  irving  uh get back to anthony with the crazy uh gun guy uh karaoke uh videos there  yeah so you you like it  you're um 
[01:13:00]  oh it's it is it is first and foremost deeply disturbing i mean  you know i could write a thesis anthony on  on uh just why do i have a gun like that in your home  don't you see the dichotomy of the whole thing  i love the dichotomy of the whole thing that's the interesting and alluring part  and the actual fact that you have an ak-47 available to  hold on to lovingly while you play carry hook is sort of scary  it's you know how much fun it is to shoot these things down at the range 
[01:13:30]  it's it's a blast it's literally  it's quite fun so i have them because i like collecting weapons i uh  i um like firing them all different types  i think they look cool they're they're um they have sort of a tactile  thing with thing where i like i like holding them  it's great  yeah  don't you ever worry about getting too drunk and like blowing someone's heads  all up or just like like going crazy don't you ever worry about having all

[01:15:30]  anyhow um so the building was filled with puerto ricans who sat on the stoop all day and drank uh cuba libres  and drug dealers and myself  and my boyfriend at the time who was  he called himself a musician but really he was a heroin addict  now were the people residents in the building nice to you because you lived there or were they shitty  the guys were nice their wives were really shitty  okay  well why you you must have been a piece of ass huh 
[01:16:00]  yeah  why else would the wives be shitty to you lydia think about it  oh no i know exactly why  if you were a mess they probably would have been your best friends  and their husbands gave me cuba libres  and petitador  what is that beer  what is cuba libres  cuba libres uh rum and coke  oh rum and coke okay  oh  i took six years of spanish i i don't know i don't know anything  all right so uh and your boyfriend at the time was a heroin addict 
[01:16:30]  yes he was  now did you dip into the heroin yourself lydia  no i didn't  i tried it once i snorted it  and it was i immediately threw up and uh never tried it again  wow  scary  mm-hmm  but i was doing a lot of blow  back then  were you  were you uh going out with a  person of a different ethnic background  not at that time  oh okay  not at that time  my boyfriend's name was vinnie  he was uh irish  no we gotta slow you down a little bit 
[01:17:00]  you did a lot of blow  young lydia  did a lot of blow  what was the  what was the wildest thing you did for a few lines  the wildest thing i did for a few lines was put my foot in a dominican store on 8th avenue  and they came back with an ak-47  why'd you put your  why didn't want them to close the door they didn't recognize me and my boyfriend was out of town  ah  i never had to trade sex for drugs or anything like that 
[01:17:30]  oh you didn't have to do any of that shit  oh you never had to do that  i didn't have to do any of that  no  lightweight  you didn't go ass to ass with another chick  scissor  no  luckily i didn't have to do any of that  all right  but um  anyhow so uh  doing a lot of blow myself  and uh trying to get through my master's program  and uh my boyfriend was doing a lot of heroin  and he brought a lot of very seedy people around our apartment  and one day one of them didn't wake up 
[01:18:00]  aka dead guy on the couch  so you just made the story suck  yeah you  i'm sorry  so you gave somebody a hot shot  so you you pretty much killed somebody  you sold someone bad dope  just say it  i didn't kill him  you don't know how to tell a story  you jumped ahead and just like threw the punchline in the middle of nowhere 
[01:18:30]  well why don't you why don't you help me  well i don't know the facts  like you have a uh a heroin addict that has a boyfriend  and he brought seedy people over to your house  were they doing drugs  what were you doing  when did you notice the dead guy  studio  we paid twelve hundred dollars a month for it  and back then that was like double the going rate  we had a window onto a fire escape that was all barred up  and then another window into an air shaft  the place was just such a wreck 
[01:19:00]  oh my god  uh we were the only white people in the place  everyone else was spanish  everyone else was uh rent control or um  or welfare  why didn't why didn't you call up lance  lance  he's dying on me lance  and for someone that did a lot of coke man  you didn't pay attention  yeah really  the guy should have never been dead if you're awake all night  i wasn't awake all night 
[01:19:30]  wow lip code  it was being fucked up  no kidding  a fucked up history  so so what you guys  you'd be so judgmental  i was born in the 60s  and came of age in the 70s  well we need some good druggy 60s music right now for lydia  man  i was dancing at studio 54 when i was  what song were you molested to  probably mungle jerry  was it something like that  was it early 70s  but was it peter frampton 
[01:20:00]  70s  huh  no it has to be like 70s 71  oh okay  so it was like jim croce  photographs and wiped out memories  yeah what song was it so anthony could do it uh  as part of his next crazy gun karaoke guy video thing  oh that would be amazing  some kind of summer song  some kind of summer song you're gonna have to do for  what was playing in the summer of 1970  hot damn  summer in the city 
[01:20:30]  yeah is that it  hey lydia what'd you  i was six years old  what'd you guys do with the dead body  uh well i told my boyfriend to get him out of there  and he you know  you know didn't know what to do  so i told him to bring him back to his own apartment  or throw him in the dumpster  i think he threw him in the dumpster  still  holy shit  you can't you can't move a dead body  this body was moved sam  sam there's big tit prints in his face 
[01:21:00]  did she just admit this on our show  the dead body was moved  what what what what  the minute i woke up that dead body was moved  oh look she's not even backing down  now i do want to say that i tell this story in the hopes of turning some young men and women around who have gone the wrong way in their life  no longer live that kind of lifestyle  a guy dies in her apartment and then they move the body  so where did he move it  you can't believe it 
[01:21:30]  where did he move the body  oh about  let's see if we were partying all night we probably woke up about one  no i didn't say in the afternoon  no i didn't say when i mean where did he move it to  well he either put bill back in his apartment which was on 42nd street and 9th  or uh put him in a dumpster i suspect bill went into a dumpster  why would why would he put him in a dumpster instead of bringing him back to his well i guess it would be tough to fucking do a weekend at bernie's with this guy  yeah put him back in his apartment 
[01:22:00]  he's probably still there  rolled him up in a sheet rolled him up in a sheet and uh vinnie was too lazy to carry him that many blocks  this is like  are you insane  you  you really have an odd past  wait how many years ago is this  uh  i was 21  so 25 years ago  i think the statue of limitations  oh my god fast forward me and aunt talking to detectives again 
[01:22:30]  yeah  oh christ  statute of limitations on just disposing of a body but i'm sure there have to be an investigation  remember that one guy admitting to all those murders and then we had detectives all over the fucking place and then they went and saw  they went and uh interviewed the guy and he showed he opened the door naked and it was obvious that the guy was completely out of his fucking mind  just a nut  i'm telling the fast version of the story then the detectives get back to me and aunt and like  no  no  what did they say to us i forgot exactly i had nothing right there 
[01:23:00]  but he thought it was fake  they basically said yeah  you know  obviously very fake  uh these coming  lydia was molested  to uh joy to the world  was that  yes yes joy to the world  joy to the world  right that was very popular when i was six or seven yeah  see  you used to dance around to it  is that why uh  oh with all my little girlfriends  dancing around  being all sexy  showing off  just asking for it  oh yeah 
[01:23:30]  we six year olds were asking for it  that's right  that a girl  lydia  your boyfriend moved a dead body and threw him in the dumpster 25 years ago  whatever happened  did you  did the cops ever kind of find the dead body  yeah did you hear about it in the news  huh  no  no one ever noticed him gone  never heard another word  what the fuck  no one who will be missed  it was like he didn't exist  it never made the papers or nothing  the family or his friends never asked questions  i don't know if he had family 
[01:24:00]  we knew a couple of people who knew him  but uh  i guess they sort of figured it out  she lived  the life  or this part of her life  like we dream  yeah  you know what i mean  when you have a dream like holy shit  dead person in the apartment  oh my god  i'm just gonna throw him in the dumpster  and hope no one notices  like she actually lived that dream  let's not start sucking each other's dicks  quite yet gentlemen  for the past 25 years  have you been worried that somebody's gonna knock on your fucking door  and ask what happened to bill 
[01:24:30]  yeah  no  but i would never run for political office  yeah well  good thing  i guess we're all in that boat  but you know what i'm saying  those dreams  where you go  holy shit  i'm so fucked  i'm so fucked  and then you wake up and realize  oh it's just a dream  but she's  for real  she lived that  she's for real  wow lydia  you know what  a lot of things about my past  bother me  bill is not one of them  hello bill  oh he's dead  why didn't you like bill  i didn't dislike him  but you know  he was a junkie 
[01:25:00]  who was crashing on my couch  yeah but the whole  disposing of the body thing  is really kind of creepy  and weird  yeah you kind of disliked him  if you said  yeah what the hell  throw him in a dumpster  yeah  he was dead already  who cares  why should we get in trouble  but anthony's a weirdo  for singing with a gun  yeah  yeah  i've known anthony a long time  i i'm pretty sure  not positive  that he's never exposed  of a dead body  i'll even say  i've never  disposed  of a body  sorry sorry  i've never disposed  of a dead body 
[01:25:30]  um  lydia  lydia  well you should consider yourself  a lucky man  anthony  no i should consider myself  with the 99.9 percentile  of people that have not  disposed of dead bodies  you should have lydia  over to the compound  she's perfect for that scene  over there  you got going on  my god  no  get her over there  not having that criminal  over there  now what happened  to the crazy boyfriend  the heroin addict  yeah  had that end  uh  he developed AIDS  i think he is dead  from what  from AIDS 
[01:26:00]  AIDS  wow  so you killed one guy  and gave AIDS  to another one  oh no  i didn't give AIDS  to him  not at all  did he give it to you  i am AIDS free  i am AIDS free  thank god  i don't know why  but i am  wow  wait  hold on a minute now  she said i don't know why  that must mean  you take it in the dumper  lydia  why does that mean  i take it in the dumper  cause why else  would you be so relieved  you didn't have AIDS  unless your boyfriend  back in the mid 80s  was splitting those cheeks 
[01:26:30]  no  come on  you can get AIDS  from vaginal sex  too if there's no condom  yeah i know that  but let's be honest  was he splitting your cheeks  he wasn't  but my husband does now  your husband splits your cheeks  he does  your ass is too old  for ass sex man  oh man  no offense to lydia  i mean and i talk about  ass sex is for the young  ass sex for the young  it's for the young man  for the young  i don't know  the babies come out  of the vagina  which means like  if you've had a couple 
[01:27:00]  of kids and you're  in your 40s  the vag might be  a little bit  fucking horse mouth  yeah but a baby  comes out every once  in a while  there's big logs  coming out every day  not at her age  they're all liquid  i'm just kidding  a good fiber log  dump every morning  lydia shits  fucking liquidy stew  she's fine  no disrespect  lydia just admitted  that she was part  of a fucking  disposing of a  dead body thing  a cover up  a cover up  wrapped in a sheet  and fucking thrown out  i'm sure that 
[01:27:30]  that's a cold case  file somewhere  they don't know  if he was murdered  or not  yes  and then being  disposed of like that  i'm sure the suspicion  is up there that  that it was  not an accident  let me let me save  let me save the detectives  a lot of time  me and aunt don't  know this lydia  we don't know  we don't have  contact info for  you're an accessory  that's right  that's right  knowledge of a crime  i'm not gonna spend  my monday talking  to detectives  such advantage  of a young girl  oh you're gonna  pull that huh 
[01:28:00]  do you think  that the cold case  the case of nice  tits doc  case of the nice  tits  what dumpster  did the boyfriend  use to get rid  of him  well i woke up  one day and  decided that if i  stayed with him  i'd probably be  dead  so you hear  different stuff  decided to leave  opie said what  dumpster did you  use where  where did he  dump the body  oh what dumpster  lord knows  back then you  know uh  back then new york  was like a shooting 
[01:28:30]  gallery  it was crazy  yeah  organized crime  owned all the  garbage  on 9th avenue  okay  yeah so they  probably  hold on a line  we got uh  andy on the line  andy you're talking  to lydia  hey lydia  what's up boys  hey andy thanks  um you know  you were on the show  like last week  talking about  i used to give  nypd psychological  exams  so you had to ask  the guys about  their drug history  right  yes  and alcohol use  don't you feel like 
[01:29:00]  a full hypocrite  talking about  giving people  psychological exams  when you  sniffed heroin  and cocaine  and everything  you disposed  of a body  how could you  look at yourself  in the mirror  when you had to  go and do that  every day  i wasn't applying  for a job  on the new york  city police department  as a police officer  i know  but don't you  didn't you feel  like a piece of shit  judging people  when you did  things that were  you are very  judgmental  for somebody  that's had  such a sordid  past  hold on sir 
[01:29:30]  let the murderer  answer  yeah it's cute  youtube videos  is nothing  compared to  lydia  fucking doing  blow  heroin boyfriend  i'm play  getting rid  of dead  bodies  if you got  if you had  a top  come in  and tell you  all that  stuff  you would  ask me  to get  committed  yeah  um  well i would  never go into  uh left rack  city and tell a  police psychologist  that story  i know but  didn't you feel  like a total  hypocrite  asshole  doing that  hypocrite 
[01:30:00]  asshole  not at all  all right  andy not happy  with lydia  not at all  all right  and footer  wants in  anthony  uh footer  you're on  with lydia  hey lydia  what's up  hey can you  set the scene  for me  so i just  picture you  running around  drunk  with those  big tits  flopping all  around the  apartment  screaming  get the  dead guy  off the  couch  is it  true  how'd it  go  oh that's  as good  a scenario  as any  the truth 
[01:30:30]  is probably  much less  exciting  i probably  woke up  uh rubbed  my eyes  you know  um not  feeling too  good  looked over  at the dead  body and  said  nah nah  hold on  hold on  i'm not  gonna let  that slide  she walks  stumbles  out of the  bedroom  she's naked  with those  big young  tits of hers  and she  probably  wanted to  nuzzle up  to the  guy on  the couch  and then  finds out  that he's  dead  because it  was all  free love  love the  one you're  with  that's  right  so she  probably  yeah i  went to  snuggle 
[01:31:00]  he was a  little cold  starts sucking  his dead  cock boner  i mean it's  dark  she's just  dead  fucking  whatever  it was a  studio apartment  and i kept  wondering why  the dog was  sleeping with  me and  vinnie and  then i looked  over to the  couch where  jojo my  dog always  slept and  uh bill was  still there and  i sort of poked  vinnie and said  god up i got  up and i walked  over and i said  uh vinnie i don't  think bill's okay 
[01:31:30]  and he's like  oh i'll be fine  he's sleeping it  off i was like  no i don't think  he's sleeping  it off  so then he  got up  how did you  know this  what did  what made  you uh  think that  did you  take a good  close look  did you  poke him  did you  uh see  it like  his eyes  glazed over  what was it  i took a  mirror out  of my um  out of my  cosmetics bag  and put it  to his mouth  and there was  no that's  what people  had told me  to do  if someone  uh  when i was  probably still  alive they  wrapped him  in a sheet 
[01:32:00]  and threw  him in a  fucking  dumpster  he woke  up crawled  out of  there  never go  back there  again  yeah  we had  saved him  once before  he had  went under  he had  taken some  heroin  and he  went out  and i  got a bunch  of ice cubes  and shoved  them on his  balls  and brought  him back  so we  did you  did you  hold him  in your  mouth  coke  whore  i'll bet

[01:36:30]  hey what's going on boy hey lydia what do you do for a job right now i'm a clinical psychologist  where at a school i would rather focus on my private practice  you work in a school you whore you're on a national radio show telling us you killed people and did fucking coke  i didn't kill anyone  well we're just assuming that you had to be part of the fucking death of uh that poor guy  yeah i hope my story stopped someone else from walking down the wrong road 
[01:37:00]  right these people are in shock you keep telling yourself you're helping people right robin while  you're slamming ice cubes on some guy's balls to wake him up to wake him up  give it a shot i wouldn't even know that that's what you have to do to fucking help some dude that's  done rob in garden city hey guys hey rob yeah uh  i yeah i realized in the past that lydia said that she worked at a school so you got to realize that there are some kids that listen to this show 
[01:37:30]  that are going to see lydia in the hall be like oh my god look that's that call  that's that coke or that takes it up the ass and it's been in like three sums and killed the heroin addict  yeah but rob very good news thank god she doesn't have a recognizable voice  yeah yeah thank god for that lydia  oh thank god you guys are on pay only  see that's uh all right let's say hi to bf in jersey bf  hey how are you hey man hey good morning jimmy

[01:38:30]  why they they finished uh digging the shallow grave you gotta help lift the body up now  yeah yeah i would never do that now that i am in my right mind drugs are evil and you should never do them  well at least you've gotten sober oh that's right oh  you still that's right you thanks jimmy yeah see at least you don't drink oh that's right oh  but in her mind it's okay right jimmy yeah the records of her past is still strapped to her  she's pulling it through every session she has 
[01:39:00]  uh do as i say not as i do none of the advice is experiential it's all just things you read in  books you have a way of clarifying things jim that's true telling these poor souls how to fix  their lives while you go home and look in the mirror i wonder how old bill would feel if he knew  that he was discarded like trash because lydia was too busy getting another line of coke yeah somebody  off a toilet seat fucking bill is dying in the other room way to go lydia somebody somebody will 
[01:39:30]  say i'm cheating on my spouse and lydia will say you have to have a conscience about this stuff and  then immediately bill's fucking chilly corpse will flash in her mind and she realized that the dog  licking bill's face is the last she saw of dumb yes do you see bill's blue hue in your nightmares oh  those glazed over eyeballs right what bothers lydia is she looks in the mirror sometimes while she's  brushing the wine off her teeth in the morning that fuzzy toothbrush and she'll look in the mirror 
[01:40:00]  and she'll say i felt nothing about bill's death what's wrong with me yeah lydia knows she's almost  a sociopath on some level right you really did feel nothing about bill right nothing nothing and and  is that doesn't that seem a little odd to you that you're there and and some a human died and  then was discarded into a dumpster into a dumpster not even brought back to the apartment and let  someone else deal with it not like a human like like trash the coroner wasn't called the police 
[01:40:30]  weren't called to uh he didn't have a proper burial it was just you you guys dumped him like garbage  his family may have still be wondering what happened to him yeah they're hoping he's in california  somewhere that doesn't bother you oh no not at not at all you just made me think about some other  stuff oh with bill and that whole crew oh my god wait what was it well one doesn't bother me at all 
[01:41:00]  why don't you share yeah what did bill did bill did bill try to fuck you did you suck 37 dicks  you know what people were so into drugs that sex wasn't even a part of it guys tell us something  else you didn't nothing's badly addicted come on lydia well some some of you still are so what  else did you did you do come on you had to do something else but you know what guys we really  gotta go um but i'll call another time but i will be watching the videos anthony how about all right  how about a tease before you yeah for the next for the next time what story like what subject can you

[01:48:00]  it should have did well and it did 40 million at the box office  bringing up against uh you know toy story well what was weird rotten tomatoes giving uh grown-ups  horrible reviews but then the nine percent nine percent positive reviews though for the critics  yeah so what is that one out of ten basically like the movie more or less uh but you go to  customer reviews on that same movie and and and customers moviegoers like in the movie yeah 
[01:48:30]  it's a silly family movie it's like it's not meant for hardcore fucking guys that like brutal  comedy it's just if you're gonna take your fucking wife and your 13 year old to a movie  that's the one you go to yeah i guess 11 11 good reviews 105 bad reviews holy  shit and people just march to the  fucking movie theater how was colin in it i don't know what was  yeah you know what i'm gonna go see that fucking i'll see it for colin and uh yeah i'll see it 
[01:49:00]  just so i could come back in here and say yep it stinks it's stunk then a few people on twitter  over the weekend beating me up going i went and i fucking liked it all right then that's the type  of thing you like what do you want for me you gotta fuck yourself what do you want from me i want  a little more for my comedy yeah exactly instead of fucking middle-aged guys peeing in the pool  and it turns blue oh holy shit that's a laugh fucking riot that's like one of the the benchmark 
[01:49:30]  bits of the movie right it's in the trailer like that what do you like for me it then unfollow me  because we're we're not going to connect on any level if you find that fucking funny if you find  kevin james getting ready to do some water skiing and he's too fat for the boat to move and that makes  you laugh then please unfollow me yeah we have nothing to talk about when the outboard motor falls off  the boat because kevin james is too fat to get up on skis on the water then you know what that's  great please unfollow me i beg you he's fat but he's not morbidly obese like that he's not that bad 
[01:50:00]  it's what why are they trying to make it like uh oh look how fat he is sam i saw colin was good in it  you saw it i saw it was the movie good uh i mean i'm just going with what i saw with the trailer so  maybe that in itself isn't fair i think the trailer portrays it pretty well it is a movie for families  but is it is it is it better than we're like saying we think it would be it was better than 
[01:50:30]  like night of the museum too that's not so awful wow you don't want to put that on a poster like  yeah you're not going to go in like you wouldn't go and have a ton of laughs you might chuckle once  how was kyle though i would say kyle was good yeah good but what does he do he's like the uh it's  all these guys are getting back together yeah and they used to be on the basketball team  and colin is like the local guy from the town who never left and he was the captain of the opposing  team when they were kids okay and so the whole time he's saying you know your foot was on the line 
[01:51:00]  back then he's like the the bad fucking guy right harbor fields has some of those guys you go to  local fucking bars in greenlawn you'll you'll you'll run into like the star quarterback from 1978 and  he's still talking about the big fucking play the game and still wearing his varsity jacket like you  know like time hasn't moved way the fuck past that moment and does it bother everybody that  colin looks 75 and adam sandler looks 14 right good for fucking sandler though putting colin a 
[01:51:30]  movie and he should be putting colin i agree but it's a lot of guys don't do that and all those  guys love colin so good they work together on remote control of them he knows all of them but  there was like a line or two that you could laugh at that the kids might not get and and there were  a couple hot chicks that the dads were uncomfortably like yeah in the theater with their kids next to  oh god so so you didn't mind the movie no i wasn't i wasn't angered by the movie i'm not  going to get it on dvd why did you go see it just to be you know uh on top of pop culture yeah just 
[01:52:00]  to see it before so i could have an opinion on it i'll tell you why he saw it because he's better  than all of us and he knows to talk about it he should see it first yes that's why he he did  something we should all do instead of just good point he saw it and then commented good point we just  talk shit but look at this picture this movie but i feel like i've seen the movie though with  all the fucking clips that are out there the trailer is fairly the trailer is fairly representative of  the film there's a nice cameo by steve buscemi which is always fun really yes why didn't kevin 
[01:52:30]  james let go of the rope why did he come why did he come all the way back and then hit the tree that's  just silly no one would do that well there was no water right he's a bit of no there was water he's  just a bit of a klutz oh really and that's that's set up trailer yeah throughout the movie it starts  with uh klutzy action on his part that's kind of what's he do well the phone rings to it's the phone  call that is the reason that they're all getting together after all these years 30 years and kevin 
[01:53:00]  james has an above ground pool you know and he tries to get out of it and since he's so heavy the  entire wall of the pool comes down and all the water falls out now this is the same kevin james that was  the star of king of queens that's him so he goes yeah guys yeah i'll be in your movie and you can  make all the fat jokes you want right well and that's what they do like they are the friends like  chris rock and adam sandler and david spade they all make fun of him for being so fat and then he  does people shimmy get shot in the face 
[01:53:30]  are we square  no he does get injured but he doesn't get shot how many fat jokes does he accept oh i mean a lot  i mean it's pretty much his and what the part david spade be doing in this movie david spade is  like the uh he's the one guy in the group of friends who never got married he still thinks  he's young he's still drinking and hooking up with chicks and i bet by the end uh he realizes  it's time to grow up well it's not so thrown in your face is that but it is sort of like hey 
[01:54:00]  of course there has to be a message enough with comedies having messages by the end the message  is more that you know i real friends stay friends if you're making a comedy just you know what go  all right this isn't real world shit let's just have fun all the way to the end of the movie not  twisted for the last 10 or 15 minutes of the movie and have some kind of stupid message for everybody  to go home with i didn't think it was a good movie for family i hate that messages and they realize 
[01:54:30]  that like they'll they'll be friends forever that's correct they accept each other's well  because they hadn't seen each other in like 30 years and so adam sandler is a big hollywood agent  with spoiled kids chris rock is uh a house husband who's really his wife gives him the business so let  me let me ask you uh before you continue with the horrid characters sure um do they all do they all  learn something from each other and realize that just give it away they can better their lives a 
[01:55:00]  little just by knowing that 30 years later this friendship they could learn something from each  other it is kind of uh night and the wives too because the wives are there and everybody kind of  realizes you know what let's take ourselves out of the real world and put you know everybody's in this  woods house or whatever yeah and they all sort of just realize you know everything aside this is  what it's this is what it's about right it's really all about good times good friends and low and  brow yeah yuck and hopefully one guy fucking the other's wife and a fucking bear a bear mauling 
[01:55:30]  did one of these guys at least find a lump somewhere no there's nothing  fuck no lumps and why weren't they together for the last 30 years yeah well you know you you  you grow and you move on they were in school yeah once you move on for 30 years you never see  people again they haven't heard well they never heard of face they never heard of facebook yeah  no they don't i guess they don't you mates i'm assuming that anybody who wanted to see the movie 
[01:56:00]  and doesn't want spoilers is not listening anymore because the reason that they all get together is  because the coach of their basketball team passes away and they were his sorry danny i'm sorry  danny but did he at least die in a great accident like he was doing poppers and a male prostitute choked  him then they wrapped him in a sheet and threw him in a dumpster by some fraud shrink how great  would it be if he was if he was fucking tied with like twisty ties from the garbage and cum was found 
[01:56:30]  on his rump and he was fucking he was choked with the fucking poppers were thrown in his face  is that what happened no it's never actually said you just assume he died of uh old age see  mark b in connecticut dumb and dumber no message right well this is hilarious but that  also wasn't a family comedy this is a family comedy this is really certainly targeted at bringing  your children to and you know it's just something that parents can actually sit through that their  children will enjoy and maybe get something out of say you know what it's not about the cell phones 
[01:57:00]  and the video games it's about good times and playing by the lake skipping rocks and right and  doing fat jokes and some fat jokes too lots of good old fat jokes yeah and james and chris rock's  mother-in-law i guess kevin james feels like he still hasn't really made it in holly sounds like  yeah guys make fun of me i don't mind go ahead whatever it takes to make me really famous i'm an  easy target right chris rock's mother-in-law he doesn't have to do that anymore if he was this  the star of king of queens well he should have told those guys no i ain't doing no more 
[01:57:30]  fucking fat jokes he's playing character ugh it's character like miss thomas i don't even know why  i hate kevin james so much but he's a fucking nice guy but i just do the mall cop and i've never met  the guy i don't hate kevin james i'm sure he's a nice guy don't really like his his movies you've  met kevin james yeah he knows adam i think i met him once too actually yeah didn't him and adam used  to tour together before kevin james was famous yeah all the time oh i met him at the ice house then out 
[01:58:00]  there in california he's like the least famous guy i didn't meet him does he do the car door bit  with the that's that might be garen valentine yeah who's his brother his brother oh really it might  be yeah oh maybe that's why i hate kevin james so much because i saw his brother's comedy  in the movie rob schneider likes older women and when he's a child  yeah when he's one of these things is not like the others rob schneider when he's a child you're 
[01:58:30]  adam's fucking friend he likes the the girl's moms and now that he's older uh he likes elderly women  elderly women could be his mother elderly seen uh okay  why the fucking why does schneider and colin have friends like chris and adam and i have friends 
[01:59:00]  like voss and bob you should pick your friends more my friends suck and when they do do their  projects they all leave me out of them i fucking i'm done with all of my friends yeah they're all  fucking horrible except for colin yeah colin put me in something who took care of me yeah yeah what  are you doing no no i did tough crowd i mean oh yeah colin's a great uh brad uh buckwalder in dc let's  not uh forget here yes uh brad the big chill as a comedy yuck this is the this is the plot of the big 
[01:59:30]  chill a bunch of people getting together for the first time in a very long time because someone died  these come back like they they they're coming back after years and stuff at least it's a white  version the black version of these really suck well where all the women do the women have a part  because i know it's all the black movies they have a part where the women are all in a place drinking  wine and then a song comes on and they'll all start dancing with each other that scene 
[02:00:00]  god i hate seeing that in a trailer you're just like i get this dribble off stop it mike and jersey  there's a lot of people really mad at us because i guess they like the movie  mike got it but what does mike have mike and jersey mike good morning boys you went to jersey  maybe at jersey nice work lou but say kevin james does do that car door bit that you were just  referring oh all right so i saw uh kevin james and adam ferrara at the ice house and this is what 
[02:00:30]  i have to say about that it's not fair in hollywood because adam ferrara was so much funnier  than kevin james when i saw both of them do their stand-up so not even close yeah not even  fucking close okay well adam's he's on rescue me well well he's the chief yeah i mean adam finally got  some nice breaks sure because dennis is his friend another guy with good friends yeah yeah exactly  all right mikey thank you gotta make better friends jimmy hey rescue me starts up tomorrow  on fx and then you got louis show right afterwards yeah on fx that's tomorrow let's make sure we 
[02:01:00]  check that out prog that yes this guy did a review on grown-ups and mentioned us uh sean in north  carolina sean hello boys hi hello do you want to know why i think kevin james is as popular as he is  i think that hollywood has this belushi farley mold and they just kind of need to keep plugging somebody  into it like we need an overweight guy to put in the ensemble so i think he's sort of riding on that  hotel right now but prior to that is samson studio yes i am yes and didn't you love the great directing 
[02:01:30]  of dennis dugan when they lead into adam sandler being able to hit that bank shot so that when you  get to the big game at the end he can have the opportunity yeah hit it for the game winner and then  lose look look that's the end of the movie let's stop let's stop beating around the what the fuck  happens okay who gives a shit if we give away spoilers and if you care out there go go somewhere  else for a little bit it's worth spoiling the big ending is that colin the whole time has been  following him around in this now that they're back in the neighborhood saying you can't beat us now 
[02:02:00]  challenging him to a rematch so they finally do the rematch at the fourth of july barbecue  with that the whole town is at which is like the fourth ending of the movie yeah  ended four times prior to that and uh nothing worse when you think a movie ends one of those  and then it kind of fades to another scene you're like holy shit that wasn't the ending because it  had more funny things to do right yeah and earlier in the film adam sandler had been shown doing his 
[02:02:30]  three-point shot i don't know what it's called from the corner of the court where uh he makes it in  every time no matter what he always makes it and he turns around and without even looking he makes  it in that's that's his whole thing he never misses and as all all his friends say oh yeah you know him  he never misses and then so the game is down to one basket this basket wins oh shit and he's in his  position to do it wide open he looks at colin and he has a moment of realization that this is what colin 
[02:03:00]  has to live for this colin's character this is all he's got going they have all their friends and  great times and everything and poor colin he only has that moment so he sinks the shot and goes tough  crowds canceled motherfucker and colin shoots himself making all his friends happy he looks at colin's  character's wife who's a who's an overweight sort of townie and they gave him a fat wife oh yeah oh  yes how do you not love this movie i'm going to see colin and his fat wife and his frump of a wife 
[02:03:30]  spoiled they texted their nanny to get everything done and now you know it's sort of  sort of giving them a spice of humble pie humble pie i like that  his kid runs up and he's like hey dad when we get home i'm going to work on that bank shot he says  we'll get him next year i'm going to work on the shot and he goes way to go son see because before 
[02:04:00]  his son just wanted to play video games and text the nanny right everything works out so well for  everybody that's good except colin who has a big fat pig to go home and eat her pussy i can't wait to  see colin's big wife oh i hope she's stunk in real life too i hope she had underarm fat lady odor  i hope she had like little neck skin tags and he had to kiss him you'll enjoy this scene the point  that i was making i did write a review and i mentioned you guys in it because what i enjoyed 
[02:04:30]  about the movie initially in the first few minutes is that when the guys get together they do have a  sort of camaraderie they do sort of go after each other the way you know bobby and jimmy and and  louie people like that go after each other in the film and i i think maybe initially they  wanted to do that but then they were forced to tell a story and like you said like you guys have  been saying there's no story to tell well one of the problems with the movie was also that somehow  a bunch of just guys just random guys that were friends they got together and they sound like four 
[02:05:00]  comedians hanging out with each other they have extremely you know quick jokes and they're just  throwing zingers back and forth is there one guy who sucks his timing sucks no of course not they're  all brilliant it's all a table at the cellar yeah they're all just hanging out oh god except one's  a hollywood agent and one's a masseuse and it doesn't happen who's the masseuse rob schneider rob  schneider has become this sort of earth mother type who's very sensitive and and wears you know hippie 
[02:05:30]  type clothes and gives massages and and all sorts of the and and dates very old women and yeah how  sandler's track record for hollywood wives he's unbelievable he salma hayek he's been with kate  beckinsale yeah salma hayek is adam sandler's wife in this film oh in the movie yeah yes she was great  on 30 rock but whatever well there you go boys you've kind of seen it half a billion did you hate the movie  oh yeah it's a piece of crap i mean it's really really bad but when you see that it makes 40 
[02:06:00]  million that's just sandler getting another blank check to do it again and again oh yeah well that's  the world we live in yeah but anytime he goes off script and does something like punch drunk love  he gets slammed so i can't really blame him for running right back to the company and he did  spanglish like i'm i don't know if that was good i hated the title of it but he does try to do other  shit like jim carrey too it's like i like the fact these guys at least like you say try to go off  do some stuff and it's like a lot of times the films just don't make the money so they have to  come back and do this stuff to prove they're still viable blockbuster guys you can't just 
[02:06:30]  fucking do it for the art forever you know what i mean it's like there's a certain business sense  you have to have to pay the rent yeah but he does they do both do stuff that they probably  could do forever like you know i mean they don't need to go out and do these other films that aren't  going to make eighty million dollars well wonder how much to i wonder how much those guys go to him  and and sort of say hey put us in something because rock doesn't need it but schneider and spade  those guys haven't done much of anything in a long time now a couple things uh when they're 
[02:07:00]  all playing basketball uh was kevin james on the court and was there some kind of fat joke there  that's another really good one yeah the reason why adam and colin are sort of going one-on-one  with their sons at the end because because kevin has to pull the i'm too fat to finish the game  and bow out after the first all right let's cut to the how many fat jokes with kevin james in this movie  i mean literally every time they throw one at him like kevin james will say you know when adam  sandler for instance was talking about the coach that had died uh kevin james said yeah maybe you 
[02:07:30]  should have learned to pass the ball and adam sandler's retort was maybe you should learn to  pass the bucket of kfc and then later on in the movie there is a bucket of kfc that they get a bit  of the coach's ashes in by mistake and kevin james decides he's still going to eat the chicken  because he's a fat guy he still wants to chill a fat joke yeah that would have been only appropriate  if it was chris eating the chicken yes exactly chris rock is the black guy who is not good at  basketball but jimmy makes a good point if it's fried chicken go for the joke black guys like 
[02:08:00]  fried chicken it was but well but you know what i mean how much for a rib right kentucky grilled chicken  and by the way the kfc product placement was awful because it first of all it was obviously the  grilled chicken and it said that on the bucket but throughout the movie kevin james's character  wore the kfc bucket on his head as if it was a wacky hat because fat guys are silly except it said  kfc all over it so obviously how about removing that hat like somebody that would um well you'd have 
[02:08:30]  to be headed it was all the way over his oh it was over his face yeah did we cover all the fat jokes when  they decide that no you saw the one on the trailer when they're like hey we're all going to celebrate  and this is ending number two and they're like we're going to go to the water park and then all  of a sudden rob schneider's in a speed boat that has come from nowhere they've had no boat prior to  this just so kevin james can hold on to the rope at the end and try and and water ski but of course the  boat goes nowhere because he's too heavy yeah and rob sherry has to keep revving it and then the engine 
[02:09:00]  drops off right that's the and then they just walk away it was like the total random gag we're going to  drop in and it's going to go nowhere and they announced we're going to the water park and kevin  james excitedly says i'm not taking my shirt off you know because he's fat they missed the opportunity  to have him jump into a pool and have the pool sort of empty of all its water but he did break the  the the other pool above ground pool we talked about that all right right there was also there's  a thing where uh have some pride yeah kevin should have some pride kevin needs to do fat jokes kevin's 
[02:09:30]  four-year-old son is still breastfeeding and uh there is a there is a joke about kevin james also  having breasts himself because he's because he's fat when when a man gets fat is his kid a little chubby  kid no it's his daughter is the daughter is a chubby little daughter she's the one with the bad  acting that can't yeah she's the bad acting but she ends up holding hands with adam sandler's  spoiled brat of a son and it's all like oh he's not a spoiled brat now they're friends they're holding 
[02:10:00]  hands oh oh paul and of course maria bella who's breastfeeding has to spray maya rudolph in the  face with her breast milk yes maya rudolph is chris rock's character's wife in the film why why  and my room is still talking about this well this i know you're right i did forget one thing maya rudolph's uh  large black mother chris rock's mother-in-law insists on going with them and she sits on the 
[02:10:30]  porch swing all day long passing gas ring the bell ring that bell there you go so she is a big fat  sassy black woman i bet that's correct she always has something to add to the conversation yes she  does she got something to say she's not holding back she won't hold back she's a diva and they  mention once twice or maybe 200 times that she flatulates fart jokes yes great like that you guys 
[02:11:00]  know what movie kevin james is doing next oh what it's called the zookeeper it comes out next summer  of course it's in the july 8th oh hey uh sean you do all right man where where could people see your  movie reviews uh i'm on rotten tomatoes i write for film critic dot com film critic dot com right  on my review of grown-ups mentions you guys so and i know you follow me on twitter what's your  twitter name there for the people out there sean underscore o'connell okay good good job today  brother appreciate it guys all right sean kent is now shooting himself in the head did kent never

[02:12:00]  for line the exact movie really the exact movie the only difference was it took place in japan  instead of instead of uh la oh but it was line for line you're saying line for line really absolutely  that's kind of interesting wax wax on wax off yeah um they changed that a little bit but that's not  why would you change the main fucking line from the original movie it's wax on what were they saying  and say wax on wax off it was a wax on wax off they had to uh he had to like hang up a jacket 
[02:12:30]  and put it down and hang up a jacket because it wasn't a karate thing it was a uh i guess there's  different moves than kung fu oh i don't know but if sam has seen it he'll tell you the you know any like  the the bad sensei said all the same shit right i didn't see karate evil sensei yes yes  all right all right justin thank you brother let's go to bobby in florida bobby hey what's  up opie hey bobby yeah i just uh i wanted to let you guys know i heard uh on howard last week uh 
[02:13:00]  chris rock called you guys opie and andy and he was talking uh to smack about you i can't remember  yeah yes a few people told me about that and uh all i have to say about that bashing his movie  well chris no it was before that chris rock was on our show a few times and and we all got along  and he he had a really good time on our show so i don't i don't know why he feels like he has to do  that on what did he say he sounded like a dick he said uh he took a couple shots at us and i'm like 
[02:13:30]  really chris rock sat in our studio we helped promote his uh project at the time and he talked  to patrice and we had a good time with the guy and we've done a couple phoners over the years too and  and we've all just got along talking about openers he said he was trying to  explain i forget the exact context of opener but the way it was set up he said like he said  when i go to madison square garden to perform there can't be anybody performing 30 days before  me or 30 days after me that's just the way it is he was talking about leno and conan  and he was saying you know that conan comedians he means yes comedians he said that conan's agents 
[02:14:00]  made a bad deal because they shouldn't have let leno open before conan so that's where the context  brought up and then he said i don't like comedians perform before me 30 days before me or after me  when i do madison square garden at madison square garden and then he said like you're the guy in  radio you wouldn't want opie and andy uh opening for you well that's not that's not an insult that's  not an insult he probably meant opie and yeah he said that's like that's like another powerful radio 
[02:14:30]  show right i heard i heard but the end yeah enough with opie and i heard it and that's exactly  what can it be you know we get it we've heard them all i think it's just a mistake people make because  you opie and andy is so ingrained in people's psyche he knows chris rock's been on the show too  much he knows yeah i could see how someone would say it leno says openy and anthony well he doesn't  open him in a minute i i i understand the open him i'm a man i'm a man i'm a thing open him and  many many that's not that bad actually it's not that bad no i think people are you know 
[02:15:00]  these things get mixed up as it goes down the grapevine all right bobby and he called jimmy a  hack well that's because he's no he didn't know i didn't hear no chris wouldn't say i think he likes  me yeah we have to make her yeah really all right uh any uh that's a good question but i'll just ask  it any tits in the movie no no no no this is one for to bring your kids  too there were a couple of shots of uh some good-looking girls bent over to fix a car 
[02:15:30]  oh yeah i bet the guys went wild with the daisy dukes right right the men enjoyed it and then  there were two good-looking girls in bikinis something for the men to look at but did the  wives notice that the guys are looking at any point uh no but they they had to play a game where they  took turns two would look at a tree while the other two looked at her and then they would shift back  and forth back and forth why i i mean i didn't i don't know what the why would be i'm not sure 
[02:16:00]  i love that that's you never want to hear that i don't know why they did that one more and i know  we're trying to move on but rich in florida has a pretty good point uh let it be uh let it be uh  known there rich what do you got well i did say i love y'all shows but y'all kill me whenever y'all  shit on a 12-year-old comedy for 12 years i mean that's who they're going after and the 12-year-olds  i watched the movie friday and they were about to piss their pants they're laughing so hard i mean

[02:25:30]  arms to wrap me into an embrace as a greeting in the inner entryway of the room as i stepped inside  he was wearing a long sleeve dress shirt it was a medium bright blue i think open at the collar and  dark pants which were slacks i think the hug went on a bit long and i was taken just a bit aback by it  if it weren't al gore i would have seriously been questioning the situation right there because the 
[02:26:00]  hug from an unknown male client before the session is a bit odd and unprofessional by typical lmt business  standards and the hug seemed a bit just a seem to last a bit just long for just a friendly hug  jesus he's grabbing all right baby i'm the vice president call me out and then he dog humps  her leg until he comes in his pants against the door now massage me whore i love al's move  al's got a hell of a move what game lmt licensed massage therapist she wants to make it sound like 
[02:26:30]  she's not a fucking yankee cranky but i don't think she is yeah maybe in her past or whatever but it  sounds like she was working for the hotel doing legit massages but she wants a million to talk  she's fucking fuck her they're all wars you pay for it uh what what's we all pay for it  i'll pay for it one way or another yeah exactly in the long run we're all paying for uh okay we'll 
[02:27:00]  just go right to the next clip here he described a grueling travel schedule over the previous week  or two mostly by air and he said he needed his gluteus hamstring quadriceps and adductors worked  on as well as his abdominal area besides right there please he needed his gluteus he wanted his  ass massage he needed some ass play because he's been sitting on his big fat ass in a plane  while preaching about the environment who doesn't love this man on his mashed potato butt 
[02:27:30]  he needed his gluteus oh that's the way you do it we got an expert in studio jimmy's gonna really  come in handy here i'd like to have my ass rubbed no you don't say that you you say it like you say it  very very professional because this way it's it's you what you're doing is you're giving her reason  to put a finger in your asshole right without feeling like a hooker so you're like uh you know  you do glutes because uh or you say like yeah i like the glutes because it's been i've been traveling 
[02:28:00]  i'm doing a lot of elliptical i'm doing the and they're like oh okay he sounds and they can go and  then that gives them a chance to go yes i will do them so you basically said you're gonna rub my ass and  she said yes his smelly roid ass because he's been sitting on a fucking plane for yeah swamp ass  those things that look like water balloons or pinatas are actually my fucking blood-filled roids  could you chew on them a little like tobacco we uh the lines are flying already jordan from scranton  i invented the internet now suck my cup exactly and then hoffman in virginia very good i'm sorry 
[02:28:30]  where did this interview happen again was it in gurney illinois gurney is me and the vice president  uh besides his back and whole body i inquired if this was due to the long flight hours and he  said yes i mentally noted that a request for adductor work is a bit unusual in the massage world  uh what adductor adductor is that his taint does anybody know what that is adductor well 
[02:29:00]  fuck i'm gonna guess it's like where the adductor uh it's what steve is google it google it he's  an adductor google it google it google it google it travis anything uh yeah it's on the side of the  thigh i was just gonna say inner inner thigh magnus muscle i would imagine yeah the large triangular  muscle situated on the medial side of the thigh which is medial where show and put your mouth 
[02:29:30]  right here it's where the side part of the inferior ramus of the pubis of course oh okay wow that's  like right in your fucking crotch is it that ligament right there yeah he learned the fucking uh  he learned the lingo so he could he go no man you know what i mean instead of saying rub my fucking  ball back rub up by my balls those are those those tendons that are right there yeah you're  fucking putt rub my balls in my ass so you can't say that then you know oh how do you not love just 
[02:30:00]  jerk him off for christ's sake you could have pressed the nuclear weapon button whenever he wanted  fucking 54 year old nothing lady but he's got he's got it now because he's using the proper proper lingo  right he knew i had six fingers in my gluteus gluteus unusual in the massage world sometimes it is  said to possibly but rarely be that it's a precursor to inappropriate behavior by male  client but it's not necessarily out of the range of professional treatment there are legitimate 
[02:30:30]  conditions for such requests and i've had him and can you explain that in layman's term the adductor  where that is on the body the adductor is the inside muscles of the thigh if you're riding horse  bareback you've got a clinch with your thighs to hang on and the reason for this i mean besides that  it's kind of a private area but it's i mean there's lots of people that have had adductor  worked on it depends on the context of who your clients are who you are what kind of work you do  thank you oh he said he was riding his fat wife around the house he and he had spurs in her little 
[02:31:00]  fat hips over the parental labels and she she comes across very confident you know what i mean  she seems like she's probably a legit therapist yeah yeah yeah i could have got her to jerk me but  yeah yeah no i don't know probably not i doubt it you're pro please al's a pro when you got vp in  front of your name i mean that's all you need she's got lmt in front of her name and she's got lmt he's  got vp yeah he knew how to work this perfectly uh all right when i began doing the requested 
[02:31:30]  abdominal work on him he became so long too oh yes the ass stomach and balls the what what cut what  happens by the abs the cock gets hard and it brushes the old knuckles oh god he and i read the same book  do you understand this is what i do this guy's brilliant yep al gore is a genius all you people 
[02:32:00]  that were crying bush stole the election in 2000 he stole it from a guy who likes to get jerked off the  same way as jimmy north jimmy old little jimmy little jimmy and a little i like the same thing we  like our abductor muscles could you rub my glutes and abs and abductors asshole balls and stomach  bitch asshole balls and stomach rub the head of my cock rub my balls and finger my took his toot  sweep bitch 
[02:32:30]  that's all it is that guy changes short is that same guy different guy way to go man way to go  that's fucking tell them apart can you that that's fucking way to go puxitani fill teeth not even close  close by the way no not even close two completely different guys but they're in front of the same  bridge though so i can see why you you're a little confused that's why talk about uh if you're just  tuning in there's a reporter on cnn he was wearing a bright pink shirt today it's beautiful incredibly 
[02:33:00]  inappropriate for for for a newsman when i began doing the requested abdominal work on him he became  somewhat vocal with muffled moans at center and he began oh that's good that's  so 
[02:33:30]  get my abductor muscle  my glutes stick a finger in my ass  he loves his boner on his ab what do you got on the global warming thing though  he just takes him out of his you distracted him again hey can we have some nice massage music  today dude the fucking appreciate the noises it's so what you do this woman is so 
[02:34:00]  oh i got on my own face oh oh my old face with muffled moans etc he began demanding that i go lower  and massaging on the abdominal area i was shocked and i did not massage beyond what is considered  a safe non-sexual area of the abdomen he further insisted and acted angry becoming verbally sharp and 
[02:34:30]  loud i went into much deeper shock as i realized it appeared he was demanding sexual favors or sexual  behaviors i decided to claire i got so freaked i just got but i got a tiny bit mad under my terror  let's be honest you weren't terrified no but he's looking for a payday or al gore is not going to kill  you yeah there's no terror there maybe in other situations with her sure but there's no terror there  if anything he's got the right to be mad he's al gore and he said go lower on my abs and there's a 
[02:35:00]  problem way to go jimmy absolutely right i understand this language though i mean so does  every man what is there a whole code thing that happens just the moaning oh yeah go a little lower  on the abs and he wanted his fucking cock head brushed oh jesus christ just brush his cock  brushes he was almost president exactly give him give him that a life of public service the  fucking information superhighway spit in your hand and fucking jerk him off asshole lady 
[02:35:30]  asshole lady the guy did help create the internet  i don't want to hear any nerves shut up  seems like he did you want more audio i'm more than i want to breathe  i decided to clarify things by asking him as he angrily complained that i was not doing what he  wanted for him to show me exactly what he wanted me to do such as wear a massage i said well why don't 
[02:36:00]  you show me because i thought this is too nuts he grabbed my right hand hard shoved it down under  the sheet to his pubic hair area my fingers brushing against his penis and firmly planted my hand on his  pubic crest region and said to me there in a very sharp loud angry sounding tone  oh there you dummy right over my cock 
[02:36:30]  oh ow exactly jerk me off stupid oh my god he was into this oh i hate these  fucking and then but she's annoying me too because she's crying like she it's like stop acting like a  victim you know the guy wants to get jerked off just fucking jerk him off yeah that's what you do and  she's a massage therapist and she's so freaked out like this has never happened to her before  exactly please well you think she um was asking for it yes well not to be a party pooper but do you 
[02:37:00]  think um she's thinking i can't leave this massage because it's al gore i'm gonna get in trouble  so do you think she was just trying to get through the hour hour and a half whatever it was  yeah without having to yeah without having to go downstairs and tell everyone um al gore wants  me to jerk him off you know what i mean the police report thing is annoying though because come on  he's not a criminal you know what it was like i'm thinking regular guys she's walking out of there 
[02:37:30]  like you know what i you know and then could go to her bosses whatever and say you know you know the  deal this fucking guy wanted to get jerked off upstairs exactly but it's al gore so you're like  fuck what do i do what do you think now absolutely i think you're right she probably is a straight  lace masseuse uh oh my god here we go this is all happening really fast as you can imagine further  yet into shock from both his demand and his angry intimidating behavior i subtly and slowly slid my 
[02:38:00]  hand up away from the area and told him it would be a counterproductive massage technique  as he had said that he'd wanted to align from stress and relax and that it would get him to  awake i said euphemistically and diplomatically i felt like i was dancing on the edge of a razor  he angrily raged an accusatory and threatening confrontational talk he he bellowed at me just  scared the shit out of me i mean i had no idea and i i've never had a client yell at me except for  one who's brain injured and she was drunk and she i've worked with her all the time she's a mess but 
[02:38:30]  he he squirted at me he goes i'm not asking imagine yelling i'm not asking for you to do anything  inappropriate to which i replied in a softer terrified calming tone no impropriety was inferred  sir at this point i was realizing just how crazy insidious he was and how precarious my situation was  when he said the aforementioned even though he clearly wanted inappropriate touch wow yeah eric from  virginia tech how awful is she pubic crest region yeah the pubic crest region 
[02:39:00]  yeah she is annoying although he was probably being stupid too you can't yell at the therapist  if she won't do it a lot of times they won't do it you got to just realize whatever she said no  wow al was getting uptight  he then tried another tactic as though he had very suddenly switched personalities and began in a  pleading tone pleading for release of his second chakra there there's so much tension being held 
[02:39:30]  ah try to talk to her in her own language this guy's good release the chakra yes oh release the  kraken is that officially a chakra i don't know what the fuck a chakra is but i know that they say  that i love when these holistic people they're like and you have your shock right really spit in your  hand and fucking yank my prick yeah how about that and you'll be shocked red and how much gets on your 
[02:40:00]  blouse  tension being held this was yet another euphemism for sexual activity he was requesting but cleverly as  though it were a spiritual request or something i was further deeply shocked and repulsed as my  realization of what was happening sunk in and especially as my mind was now reeling from this  absolute betrayal by someone i had inherently trusted as a good guy who cares about people including me 
[02:40:30]  because of his public persona wow wow wow it would be horrible a guy like that  wanting you to jerk him off if that's not what you do that is like a weird  she sounds legit jimmy she does that's what i'm saying yeah she sounds pretty uh pretty uh  good there she's she doesn't sound like just some whore they brought in and right  you know yeah well he wanted a fucking he wanted me to jack him off 
[02:41:00]  oh my god she's got all the clinical terminology and everything and release my chakra my chakra  dude we haven't even cochra we haven't even begun with this audio oh there's more oh my god yay  love it condoms erection oh please kiss one at a time oh this is wonderful this is great stuff  wife nipples groping stains slacks oh when i came out he was in his robe and he complimented me on the 
[02:41:30]  session i felt i could leave without further problems from him but i was wrong in that surmising i was  free so they got so she got through the massage she obviously felt like she couldn't leave she was scared  and then she's thinking okay i finally got over i got past this i can get the bug out of here and  make believe this never happened but but i wasn't having any of that i was freaked out and trying to  act calm and collected so as not to look vulnerable and so as to keep any other weirdness from him from 
[02:42:00]  happening he engaged me in small talk as i headed for my massage table to break it down and he came over to  where i was while i was trying to pack up and then he wrapped me in an inescapable embrace as i turned  around doing this come hither look deep into my eyes and caressed my back and buttocks and breasts  i swirmed to try and get out of his grasp he couldn't take it anymore no more chakra talk no 
[02:42:30]  fuck that give me those tits i swirmed to try and get out of his grasp telling him to stop don't  several times and i finally told him i said you're being a crazed sex poodle hoping that he'd realize  how weird he was being yet he persisted he was much stronger than me bigger than me and insistent it  was completely unnerving crazed sex poodle this doesn't sound good for al no no no 
[02:43:00]  great though i had the fear that rape would be inevitable if i could not get out of the room yet  i could see no way to immediately leave without it also being a risk to my safety because i felt he  would use force to counteract forceful moves on my part so i distracted him by pointing out  the box of chocolates on the conference table hey fatso look at those and he poured it into 
[02:43:30]  wine or brandy glass after which taking a sip he pushed it to my lips as he cornered me with a big  seduction smile i don't drink i'm allergic to alcohol pause i did i wonder if that means she's in  recovery allergic to alcohol not to blow her spot up but i mean all fucked up yeah i uh she might  have a real allergy to it but if i don't i will sometimes say that if i'm out with people who don't  know my history yeah i'm just i'm allergic to this shit yeah wow 
[02:44:00]  oh  i did enough in college anyway i pushed it away saying i do not drink liquor because allergies and  he insisted saying come on just taste it and pushed it into my lips again whereby it ended up sipping  some um he then forced an open mouth kiss on me who was cornered by him sticking his tongue into my 
[02:44:30]  mouth the french kiss me i pushed back and said stop it stop it you're being way too frisky  and i was distressed and shocked and terrified  frisky you're being a little too frisky here you that allergy alcohol line makes me really believe  her that's not something you had a few sips no she had a few sips he dumped it in her mouth  no she said she sipped it but it wasn't come or booze you dummy he probably just said come  on take some and probably just hit her lips and you know holy man very aggressive what a dope he is 
[02:45:00]  he really really is a little force in a relapse yeah jeez i was distressed shocked and terrified  he laughed clearly enjoying himself at the expense of my discomfort refusal and fear this was ever more  disturbing and frightening to me as i saw he was determined to have a sexual act with me  at this time he had been pressing his body up against mine and holding me tightly and i was 
[02:45:30]  not certain if his robe was open or closed in the front it seemed part way open like the ropes are small  he's rotund you know and i did not want to look down to see i could feel what seemed to be an erection  from him lest he be further encouraged and aroused by seeing me look down and i did not want to look  anyway as he repulsed me oh you oh what a bitch oh man al was a naughty al is so naughty al had an 
[02:46:00]  erection she never would have said anything if he would have just let her go after the massage and  said look i'm sorry i got a little frisky it's been a long time if he if he would have made her feel  like look i respect you i was just a bit of an ass my apologies because i've had times when massage  therapists said no and um but that means yes right jimmy yeah so i hit the bitch with a clock 
[02:46:30]  i brained her with a clock and fucked her while she was snoozing that a boy jimmy that a boy i don't  take no means yes yes means yes it's all just yes yes yes yes yes yes no rub my abdomen touch my  touch my uh whatever dick balls ass dick balls and ass quickly  here here you go you're drunk have some booze on your lips i don't care you're in recovery 
[02:47:00]  have a little booze on your lips maybe this will loosen you up you need to get sauced again  that's what you need not caring what that would do to the broad after they separate oh i know yeah  back drinking jesus he fucked up though but he may because i've never i get i've gotten very annoyed  when they've said no especially when they've brushed my cock quote unquote accidentally and then said no  well but it's like i can't yell at them because technically they are there doing what they're 
[02:47:30]  supposed to do so i've gotten mad just because i you know it's again it's about i want what i want  when i want it every man wants it you think you sat there just going i fucked up frankie i really  fucked up this thing wow wow wow all right there was the hotel room treat box the kind of thing you  should basket that holds chips cookies teas chocolates etc you commonly see in hotel rooms  and he said that the hotel he put condoms in it he held up a small plastic case at me and i was 
[02:48:00]  getting more deeply distressed by all this and all i could think to say was to dispute that it was  condoms i just found this unbelievable because i didn't know that these were in the treat boxes  i'd probably stay in motel sixes you don't have these things um and so and i didn't have my glasses on  so it looked like one of those little plastic sewing kits to me so the first thing i blurted out i said  it's a sewing kit wow there's no way a hotel would put that in a gift basket right i think 
[02:48:30]  they do it's in the treat baskets like they have like the little naughty lotion it's expensive  too because they know they know that you're in a pinch you're going to use the rubber in the hotel  thing that's a five-star hotel i think you know what i mean with yeah he's not staying in some  shithole it's probably standard in the room i don't think they gave it to him oh it sounded like  a gift basket do you remember we used to stay in that one in dc yeah yeah and where melinda found  the mice or whatever in the back that i think would have condoms in the uh in in the minibar  it did yeah yeah it had all kinds of like lotions and those motions potions sexy stuff it's a cool 
[02:49:00]  little hotel yeah until they found live rats in the back yeah people under the stairs no mice  oh are they mice yeah yeah it's a big difference that was a cool we used to go down at dc  fucking vicious compared to mice mice are just creepy and if you have mice you don't have rats so  really i had to learn all this stuff when i was infested with uh mice in my really old brownstone yeah  uh the audio continues with this then i asked him how he i said how do you rectify this with your wife 
[02:49:30]  wrecked them thinking this would cause him some remorse and mellowing to which he angrily bellowed  instead quick shift of mood again which frightened me anymore yeah i never saw anybody's moods just  like this it made me go this man should never be in charge of the red button it would be really scary  his mood um he bellowed he goes i wasn't gonna do anything i mean just screaming 
[02:50:00]  um more deeply frightened by his temper and the way he was suddenly stalking around like a dog with  hackles up on his back i started backpedaling it was something well about well everyone's  relationship or marriage is a private affair no one really knows for absolute certainty what is the  true arrangement that was private with bill and hillary for example anyway and that part's nobody's  business but they're all i'm trying to fix things i realized later this is just a side i really stepped  in it because the talk about bill and hillary is like a sore point with this guy and i didn't know so 
[02:50:30]  he's just like and i'm like you know really freaked out oh and i'm like why didn't she just jerk him  off the second he came he would have been mellow yeah oh he's yelling al yeah well a lot of good uh  instant feedback jordan again this guy uh can't get some young environmentalist college broad to lick  his asshole he can get whatever he wants that's why he was alone 11 o'clock wanted to get jerked  that's what he wanted a few people say why don't i believe al and and and then a few people saying 
[02:51:00]  she sounds like she's reading it i guarantee she's reading this she's reading her statement yeah this  is a big fucking deal so she got her thoughts together on paper before she uh uh before they  push record this was the statement she is actually reading her statement yeah you could tell she wrote  a statement and they said we want you to read it i think just so that didn't do is no manipulation of  it right but it's not that i don't believe she absolutely is reading it but i've been there too  many times and this does not sound like a lie i just believe her she doesn't sound like she's lying 
[02:51:30]  kristen redding at least republicans hire actual hookers um uh what was the one about yeah we were  gonna get rid of clinton for this guy this guy sounds creepier than fucking clinton right yes  uh there's a few more but a lot of uh people reacting to this audio today al gave her a big  tongue kiss and grabbed her bra again he approached me and he grasped me and gave me a big tongue kiss  at this point i was even more afraid of him physically and i tried again hard to squirm away he grabbed at 
[02:52:00]  my right camisole bra strap under and through the armhole of my sleeveless sweater and roughly tried to pull it  down off me in an attempt to disrobe me saying what's this i broke away from him and with and  firmly with even more distress again said loudly stop it and disturbingly he giggled some more  he's getting off on it jesus steven has for bayshore she's allergic to shutting the fuck up 
[02:52:30]  really clam up uh you know what kyle from indiana writes if she was so scared why didn't she just  leave we sort of talked about that i think she felt like she couldn't leave because it's the vice  president and in a weird way people gonna be like shut the fuck up that really plus her boy she doesn't  want to get all of a sudden i and again i i would normally say the guy the guy but she's got to  realize that she might be fired if if the fucking former vice president says that girl tried to all 
[02:53:00]  he has to say is i threw her out of my room because she offered me sex for money she offered to perform  moral sex on me for an extra two hundred dollars and then all of a sudden she's got the ex-vice  president of the united states that that is a hairy position for a woman to be in man that's what he  should have uh used though he should have said look if you don't do this i am going to go out there  and say that you offered me sex and i was outraged i think as a guy you can't say such a piece of 
[02:53:30]  shit thing it's almost that's the equivalent of pulling out a gun it's just no fun after that  it's just no fun after that if you need that uh wow okay listen to this all i could think of  the song was dear mr president by pink he said it was written to protest the current administration  and that it has been or was going to be chosen to accompany some presentation of his  or a film as were some other songs chosen by melissa ethridge as soon as he had it playing 
[02:54:00]  he turned to me and he immediately flipped me flat on my back and threw his whole body  face down over atop me pinning me down and out weighing me by quite a bit get off me you big lummox  i loudly protested to him and i struggled with my whole body to shove him as hard as i could to roll  him off me and get out from underneath him and i using my whole left leg and stuff and that's where  i strained all the muscles but i didn't realize it at the time and then he tried to go on a motorboat 
[02:54:30]  ride but he was too fat and the motorboat engine fell off you big lummox this is melissa ethridge yeah  oh very good they're saying pink yeah pink was playing how do you like pink oh boy is alcor  embarrassed today yeah he's probably not going out i will say fox is covering it but i why is this  not on every other news channel this is huge fucking no it will be today jimmy this one they're not  going to avoid oh thank god i don't think i can't stand the oil shit anyways enough about the oil 
[02:55:00]  i need more stuff to check out stupid oil the um yeah i don't see the other stations really pounding  in this story like foxes of course foxes uh you know fox they're gonna jump on this one cnn has to  jump on this they would be crazy nonsense and not like this is big ratings they won't bash it they  won't bash al gore that bad not that badly you big lummox oh my god listen to this one i started to sit 
[02:55:30]  up and he tightly grasped my right wrist and where am i in hand and we lay on our sides a couple feet  apart looking at each other as he played the song him singing along with it as if he were revealing  deep feelings like some bizarre karaoke and me stuck there staring at this unpredictable predator wondering  how to get loose and get away i was terrified to struggle further because i felt like he would then 
[02:56:00]  force himself on top of me again i did not know what to do next i was just shocked at his craziness  i forced a smile and i just i just asked him with a quiet sympathetic tone in my voice at that point i  just said how just how long were you whacked out after the election i just got to the point where i was  like to which he replied six and a half years so far just giggling his head off and then he went on 
[02:56:30]  singing to me wow he sounds crazy sounds insane he was singing a pink song while trying to get  jerked off in the hotel he was this close to being i know and he's running around he seems like a cunt  because when these guys are questioning about the environment he's like i'm not doing any interviews  right he seems like a bit of a douche that's good somebody wrote that down when asked what his act  was called he said the aristocrats he likes pink a lot of questions coming in we got a couple more 
[02:57:00]  clips here but first uh ryan in florida ryan hey guys hey ron again uh i got a question for jimmy yes  sir hey do you do you ever have like any straight laced uh like massage therapist ever  off her handles or do you kind of always have to ask for them it's it's it's a bit of a cat and mouse  game because i want to feel like she kind of isn't wants to do it because she likes my cock and she 
[02:57:30]  kind of wants to feel like she wants to do it because i'm special it's like we both like to play  game with each other and this is any client with any therapist i never liked when they would just go  hey if you want anything extra it's going to be that would never turn me on because there was no  game there was no seduction there have i had legit ones do stuff absolutely wow but it never almost  never does it happen the first time with the legit ones like i've had a few that i think got addicted 
[02:58:00]  to the money because you're paying them a lot and and like but usually the first time they wouldn't  uh but you got a vibe that it was possible after it's like it's it's like a it's a perverted dance  you're doing but i think it's cool it's like you know you take care of her she's taking care of  whatever it's nothing wrong with it you know yeah yeah all right that's all right but isn't if if a  legit uh massage therapist jerks you off isn't she not legit again a lot of the one used to drive me 
[02:58:30]  crazy because she would say look i don't do that anymore and i would like i wanted her so bad  but she used to do it i knew she used to do it i think a lot of them have at one point  yeah but um yeah if a legit one does it is she not legit it's massages is a sensual thing man again  can it be very professional and other massage therapists that are completely not yes the ones  you see in spas and hotels are normally but to be that close to somebody all the time to have to tuck 
[02:59:00]  a sheet so you don't touch their balls or ass yeah it's you're never that far away and i know  physical therapists for sports teams will scream at me for that but fuck them it's not it's not as  big a leap as you would think and i don't think it's prostitution to be honest with you i really don't  that mean legally it is sure but if a girl is massaging you and she's kind of like yeah why not  and she jerks you off that to me does not make her a hooker no no no no she sucks your dick that's 
[02:59:30]  different that's a totally different level of sexual interaction i love jesus logic here but it  is you know i mean one is you know jerking somebody off is completely just a mechanical release devoid of  any disease risk of any intimacy it's a dick sucking and fucking or pussy eating i mean that's a totally  different talking and talking talking hmm hmm what about uh giving up the ass that's acceptable in a  profession because you're an lmt yes yes and she's massaging your dick uh with her with her 
[03:00:00]  colon that means lick my tuchus lick my taint yeah uh two more clips to go here he pleaded grab me  engulf me in embrace tongue kiss me massage me grope my breasts and painfully squeezed my nipples  through my clothing pressed his pelvis he's an angry motherfucker i love him he's one of those fat  massage lady tits yeah my clothing pressed his pelvis against mine rubbed my bikes with his hands 
[03:00:30]  and fingers and rubbed himself against my crotch saying you know you want to do it as i kept pulling  and struggling and pulling away from him this is when i'm up and trying to leave um  i finally got out the door after being forcibly being pulled back in the room in the doorway by him a  couple times and trying to leave to be groped and fondled and have tongue kisses forced on me this  is what he's doing and that's when he's saying you know you want to do it and i was just thinking oh my 
[03:01:00]  god um when i finally got away i hurried down the hall to the elevator and went downstairs via the elevator  where i felt really shaky and faint and i right i right quite shaken at the main lobby where i could  hardly think you're right yet i needed to scribble out a receipt for the hotel to get cash before i  left oh my god yeah that's when he grabbed me again yes that's that's when the that's when the uh the 
[03:01:30]  night concierge raped me with his with his little bell that you ring when he's away from his desk he put  the bell in my anus one more clip and man this is the doozy the grand finale as i took off my clothing  to go to the shower i noticed some stains on the front of my black slacks these are newer black slacks  it might have been the second time i wore them so i said they could dressy possibly could warm on a date  so i was trying to be like i'm messed up and um i took them off and i said what's the stains on the 
[03:02:00]  front of those and i wondered if it was soap or bodily fluids from core pushing up against me repeatedly  because they're about here pulling me down etc with nothing on but his hotel issued terry rowe  with a belt to hold it closed i carefully hung them up and decided to be sure not to launder them  until i knew more what to do with what had happened just my intuition more than 
[03:02:30]  fucking splooch for the collection clear stuff donner what is it with him and clinton getting  come all over everybody's outfit come on you dummies wow jesus al what do you say al what does this  mean in the end you know he's not really going for any office anymore but he's not fucking talking  that's why are you not denying this over why aren't you denying this but i'm saying if it's not true if  it's not true you got to come out and go she's a liar right this woman is lying i bet it's completely

[03:07:30]  words instead of just being very firm and saying well the aggressive firm as al was the problem is  the aggressiveness after the massage you know what i mean yeah that's what it is he wanted some  fucking pussy i think she didn't know how to handle him she probably is moody and and and weird like  that she probably didn't know how to handle him and so you try to like use that whore talk quote  unquote just go look come on what's the matter she probably want to come off and go hey you  fucking pig stop it because she had to get her money and he was the ex-vice president but if he if 
[03:08:00]  she is a licensed massage therapist lmt lmt yes yes uh then she should know the the what to do like if  if a fucking doctor is doing something and and you're like hey doc jerk me off uh the doctor's not  gonna use playful language i think she was scared because she couldn't believe it was al gore and  then she has to go downstairs and go uh al gore just fucking grope me upstairs people can be like  shut the fuck up that's what i'm thinking anyway i don't know you might be right i think anyone else

[03:11:30]  he got uh he got what it was coming to him tell you the truth yeah a little lip he got a little lip  from uh the guy behind the counter and uh he couldn't take it vice president joe biden is reminded  that he's at cops frozen custard shop not an ice cream store in greenfield moments later  he's in the back scooping custard for cones and taking a few licks himself  where are you oh don't worry if i don't know uh do you guys help lower our taxes 
[03:12:00]  a few minutes after the cops manager's comment on lower our taxes there's another exchange  after the manager told us he enjoyed his banter with the vice president it was very nice he uh  he's got a great personality but the manager admits the vice president didn't seem happy at first  about the lower our taxes comment i don't think he liked it but then later on he whispered me i'm just 
[03:12:30]  kidding you can't assume that everyone likes you when you go in those situations i was only kidding  that's new this is what a fucking faggot country we are the vice president's joking with somebody  or whatever he goes don't be such a smart ass all the time and the president's even if he wasn't  he sounded a little he's like he's ball breaking like all right don't be such a smart ass you can  say something nice not be a smart ass yeah but that's news did you see the video though because  like he he looks like he's pissed off like he kind of yeah he's gotta be pissed yeah like he's like  come on he's making that face like come on i'm just do i'm doing this you know in your store and 
[03:13:00]  you're gonna fucking bust my balls yeah maybe he was annoyed but even if even if you want to say  he was annoyed the fact that that's news in this country that that the president said the word ass  we are just we're fucking despicable is it that he said ass or is it that he just got angry i think  it's more i think it's more than he got angry at this guy for talking about his taxes he has a working  guy he's uh owns a business he's being taxed up the fucking asshole and and uh the guy said yeah what 
[03:13:30]  can i do for you or something and and and he said lower my taxes i would i would love to think that  it really has something to do with the ludicrousness of a vice president becoming annoyed at a hard  worker being talked to about tax i would love to think that but this dumb country it is just the fact  that the president said something snippy with the word ass in it like when he whispered the word  fuck to obama they can't get enough of a politician using a naughty word yeah well there was it was a 
[03:14:00]  great opportunity it was a great opportunity for that guy and the guy was okay about it he said  yeah you know he was he had a good personality he didn't trash him sell plenty of frozen custard  frozen custard and fucking frozen custard just have ice cream treat yourself if biden said something  like hey could you stop being a cunt lip with ears that would be newsworthy can you imagine the  vice president said oh that'd be great be wonderful love to hear that oh look at kegan she's just 
[03:14:30]  unpleasant to look at oh yeah oh where she looks like dudley from hollywood nights if anybody remembers  that movie i do not remember mother i'm going to screw someone the big fat guy god damn it i'm sorry it's not  ringing a bell that was a tony danza movie with robert wool and michelle pfeiffer i think that was her  first movie wow that's old yes it is hollywood nights never sought it sorry you have to see hollywood

[03:16:30]  the national task force against homosexuality in uganda we are making legislation to make sure that  sodomen and homosexuality never sees the light of legality in this land of the part of africa  i've taken time to do a little research to know what homosexuals do in the privacy of their bedroom  one of the things they do is called enolicking where they a man's enos is leaked like this 
[03:17:00]  by the other person like ice cream and then what happens even the poopoo comes out the other poopoo's  out and then they eat the poopoo the other one they do is they have a sex practice called fisting  it's too visual okay sorry did they they show a shot of the crown they all got their notepads and  they're taking notes after he says eat the poopoo how do you have a rational discussion with this man 
[03:17:30]  this is the same country that had idi amin in charge for as many years as they did so it's it's  just these aren't real people i'm sorry like ice cream like the other guy had to reiterate you know  they lick they lick the anus and the other guy goes like ice cream like ice cream he's a real person  he's got a macbook that's true he does have a macbook with all of his homo notes on there  back all of his homo facts oh wait you see uh uh move back slightly there okay good and then they 
[03:18:00]  eat the poopoo the other one they do is they have a sex practice called fisting where they insert their  hand into the other man's hand and it goes on into the enos all the way and it is so painful they have  to take drugs but they enjoy it now if we have any children please step out this is a parental guidance  moment that child can be moved out so i've done research now it's time to get the children out of 
[03:18:30]  the room after they talked about eating the poopoo and fisting uh... licking ass like ice cream fisting  now please leave the room and he's grabbing his uh... macbook  this is what they do number one you can see a man here having sucked the other person's rectum  and the other person is poopooing and this one is eating the poopoo all over the place and you  cannot see it because of the foundry music logo but the man with the goatee and the flame shirt

[03:28:30]  oh but he's all ours he certainly is jesus age christ yes  wow that's uh that's something yeah continent oh oh uh opie you're being paged what happened  what oh dr steve oh uh dr steve good morning boy we just we just played a video where a guy was 
[03:29:00]  talking about eating the poopoo i heard it was just it was just terrific it was mad yeah isn't that  great what what what uh what can you get medically from eating the hepatitis just listen  jesus jimmy's doing a good dr steve impression  very good uh it's uh there are a few fecal oral uh uh diseases that you can get from eating the 
[03:29:30]  poopoo and uh hepatitis is one of them hepatitis a not hepatitis b though is a bad  no it's not it's it's if you have to have a hepatitis it's the one to have all right if you  have to have it if you're only going to get one hepatitis this year make it a yeah because a b and c  but you don't want to get d or e or f it's something you know oh wow chip oh chip oh dr chip uh yeah 
[03:30:00]  and uh why don't we see more of those diseases in the homosexual community if this poopoo eating is going on  well because i mean really there uh although the reason that the anus is so far away from the mouth  is because i mean there's a reason for why we're built that way that it's you can't eat your own  ass because because basically it's just filth and you're not supposed to eat it uh how come animals 
[03:30:30]  dr steve aren't uh susceptible to uh that type of stuff when they lick their own ass and eat  shit yeah well they're just uh that's part of their uh culture and they're uh they're they're habituated  to it or uh you know they're they're inured to it and so they can uh a dog's mouth has hydrochloric  acid in it so it can kill a lot of bacteria anyway oh no uh that's that's my theory anyway 
[03:31:00]  i don't know exactly why they can eat fecal matter no it's called poo-poo eat the poo-poo  eat the poo-poo uh mongo the trucker has a great uh question for you dr steve on the poo-poo uh mongo  yellow mongo mongo yeah all right well mongo wanted to ask if you eat the poo-poo do you poo-poo the  poo-poo yes you do wow wow that's a movie out where they uh they're trying to make a human centipede and 
[03:31:30]  they uh yes danny saw that it's not good oh you saw it danny yeah it's a weird fact man good it looks  really strange it there's no it doesn't really follow like the the logics of movie well yeah  because it's more it's like it was like trying to be saw but there was really no plot like it was just  really about this this demented doctor and like it never goes anywhere there's no there's no comic 
[03:32:00]  relief or backstory it's a diabolical doctor i want to make a horror movie where the guy just does that  to show how evil he is right i love doing that into a girl's vagina girls hate when you make that  noise into their pussies well the two or three people downstream that are living on uh re already  processed shit would die within a week so that's just not feasible that's just silly yeah it's not  feces-able haha get it yeah all right dr steve dr steve thank you uh well they can't all be gems 
[03:32:30]  guys oh that's good that's good this was a quick we just like one of them to be very informative yeah  you're you're fine bye steve i'm glad i could inform you on eating the poo-poo yeah i could have told  at least you're using the proper words today i've had a rough one rougher than than normal what i  just i called it cabaret instead of cabaret i didn't catch it though i said you were enjoying a 
[03:33:00]  a glass of cabaret what an idiot all right what'd you say steve your phone cut out yeah no that's okay  uh this is uh great what happened uh supreme court united states supreme court extended the reach of  the constitutional right to bear arms by saying it binds state and local governments as well as the 
[03:33:30]  federal government um the ruling broadens the sweep of the court's 2008 ruling interpreting the  constitutional second amendment as protecting the rights of individuals rather than just those of  state-run militias it's a victory for of course the nra which joined a group of chicago residents  in challenging the city's law because if you could of course you know chicago uh you're not allowed to  own uh a gun in chicago the nerve of that a fucking city yes with all the drugs and crime to keep 
[03:34:00]  people who are legally responsible for owning a gun what a bunch of assholes you cannot own a gun in  chicago and chicago by the way some of the highest gun crimes uh in the country which right there  proves it proves that gun control at its strictest does nothing to curtail gun crime it's the horseshit  thing politicians say yes because it's a knee-jerk reaction it's like saying school budget it's just  this knee-jerk thing that people feel like they can't argue against gun control yeah that sounds right 
[03:34:30]  yeah yeah so uh yeah it's the case mcdonald versus the city of chicago and uh ronald wanted a gun  he's tired of the black kids going you redhead motherfucker and knocking his wig off  yo give me that money in that house you carry you motherfucker  the justices voting five four in a case involving chicago's handgun ban said that individual gun rights  were among the fundamental guarantees protected against state interference through a constitutional 
[03:35:00]  amendment after the civil war what was against who are the four that are against it what's their  constitutional i i i guess because the interpretation some people make is that it uh gives the rights to  a state-run militia and not an individual but it is indeed an individual's right to bear arms it's it's  it's it's it's so simple when you read it it really is and and gun control people have always used it 
[03:35:30]  and use that line in it about the militia um to try to get guns away from uh individual citizens  but i hope this really goes far in um getting a lot of the restrictions out of uh some of these places  like chicago and uh i i think if you have a gun license it should be like a driver's license  where you um but first of all a driver's license is a privilege it's not even a right right gun gun 
[03:36:00]  ownership is a constitutional right sure and if you do have a license or a permit to carry a gun you  should be able to uh take it state to state and in america by the way you should be able to protect  yourself not just from fucking an intrusive government but from a guy on the corner who's  selling dope into a car who will shoot you it's fucking sickening you can't protect yourself yes  yeah the the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed it says a well-regulated 
[03:36:30]  militia comma being necessary to the security of a free state comma the right of the people  to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed a militia used to be the people yeah that's what  it was a militia was it was uh uh when you called people to arms it was the the blacksmith and the  storekeeper and they'd grab their guns and they were the militia and that's why as individuals you kept 
[03:37:00]  arms these were all provisions against a repressive government of course all of them were so does it  really make sense to say that number two the right to bear arms was meant only for for state-run  things it doesn't make sense it's it was meant to keep the government in check everything you read  uh uh as far as the first few uh constitutional amendments go are meant to keep the government  in check so they can just walk all over everybody that's why the third that's why the third amendment 
[03:37:30]  is each citizen will have the right wherever he feels it necessary to wear a hat he will be allowed  to wear a hat without prejudice or without receiving a horse erection in his hiney because that's what  would happen in england i i i think it's that a soldier can't just shack up in your house i think  that's number three oh really yeah oh we what are you talking about that was they said that we had to  no my mother said that's why they were staying over yeah you're not allowed to just shack up 
[03:38:00]  soldiers shall in time of peace be quartered in uh uh no soldier shall in time of peace be quartered  in any house without the consent of the owner nor in time of war but in a manner to be prescribed by law  what the fuck that was i don't know but that that is kind of a big drop off after two two one you  can speak freedom of speech two three arms three bad stormy guy comes to your house but they mess up 
[03:38:30]  everything they really leave the house a fucking they do they just have muddy boots and guns and raped  women you understand what was happening soldiers were staying in people's houses they were unarmed so  they would fuck you a woman and you couldn't say shit about it one two and three exactly and they  wouldn't leave they would just stay there eat all your food yeah fourth is the uh illegal search
