<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about their recent 30-day suspension and a website error that listed them as "Opie and Andy."  The hosts, along with in-studio guests Sam and Patrice O'Neal, then launched into a conspiracy theory about the purported death of Vince McMahon, speculating about a staged explosion and the involvement of a fictional Federal Investigation Center (FIC). This segment was filled with humorous, speculative details and interpretations of news reports.  Simultaneously, a discussion about changing fashion trends – specifically the debate between cleavage and low-rise pants – and their perceived impact on bartender tipping unfolded.  This led to an on-air interrogation of "cleavage girls" from the Hard Rock Cafe by Patrice O'Neal, resulting in sexually suggestive and offensive banter.  "Hard Rock Johnny" was also mentioned as preparing breakfast for the show. A phone contest offering a Father's Day trip to the Bunny Ranch in Nevada was also introduced.

The Bunny Ranch theme continued, featuring several women from the establishment as guests.  The conversation shifted to the experiences of sex workers, including client discretion, relationships, and encounters via Craigslist.  Carrot Top's purported patronage and physique were also discussed.  The Father's Day contest was highlighted, featuring contestants "Bear" (a married father of four with a twelve-year sex drought whose wife surprisingly supported his entry) and "George Kennedy."  The hosts and guests engaged in extensive and sexually explicit discussion about Bear's marriage and lack of intimacy, filled with jokes and commentary on his appearance and family life.  A second contestant, Joe B, was also introduced, whose story involved his father's loneliness stemming from Joe B's childhood revelation of his mother's infidelity.  Bear Grylls ("Man vs. Wild") was announced as a future guest, with the hosts noting the ironic coincidence of having two "Bears" in the studio.

Bear Grylls' interview followed, detailing harrowing experiences from his show, including a near-death experience with a sinking boat near icebergs and constant mosquito bites. He described his diet, which included ants, sheep's eyeballs, and water extracted from elephant dung.  He contrasted his survival experiences with his normal life, including his family and dislike of restaurants.  The conversation then shifted to his wife, Louise, who was called on-air.  The ensuing discussion focused on her lack of intimacy with Bear Grylls, with the hosts and guests engaging in sexually suggestive comments and discussions about their marital problems.  Despite Louise’s blunt and dismissive responses, the hosts decided to award Bear Grylls a trip to the Bunny Ranch. The discussion continued on awarding George Kennedy a Bunny Ranch trip as well, with the hosts eventually contacting Dennis Hof to secure approval for both.  The segment ended with discussions about an upcoming Opie and Anthony comedy show at Jones Beach, mentions of guests (Patrice O'Neal, Rich Voss, Otto), and their return to the air after suspension.  The show concluded with the hosts leaving the studio and off-air comments.


Patrice O'Neal then recounted an on-air incident on Fox News, detailing a contentious exchange with a female news personality and subsequent offensive jokes about her and Al Sharpton.  The segment covered the fallout, including Fox News' apology and Patrice's career setback. The discussion then moved to the show's website issues, attributed to a German server overload, and the support received from fans leading to the creation of "People Against Censorship" with Debbie Wolfe as spokesperson.  This was punctuated by crude jokes, references to sexual acts, and racial slurs.  Bob Saget called in to promote his upcoming appearance at Jones Beach, adding to the crude humor and sexual innuendo.  The playing of a 1994 demo tape featuring Anthony's early work followed, leading to self-deprecating humor and embarrassment from everyone.  This portion included numerous interruptions, insults, and ribald jokes from Patrice O’Neal, Jim Norton, Rich Voss, Bobby Kelly, and Otto.


Opie started a "celebrity death watch" segment, predicting two more celebrity deaths before October 1st after Jessica Tandy's passing.  The hosts then played a tape of an old radio show, filled with crude humor and song parodies, followed by listener calls, including repeated calls from Sally.  The discussion ranged from listener calls to personal anecdotes, including a car crash outside the studio. A Pizza de Lusso contest was also featured, along with discussions of the hosts' past experiences and career paths.  There were mentions of future guests, including Sam Kinison (only an impression due to a hoarse host), Sam Houston, and other guests present in the studio. The segment concluded with more chaotic banter, playful insults, and a final song.

[00:13:30]  girls are in here girls  also uh we developed the uncomfortable close interview in the last 30 days they didn't even  know about that uh jimmy's hbo uh taping uh he did that uh since you last heard of destroyed  oh we now uh go into the girly magazines like the cosmopolitans and magazines like that and see what  they're what they're talking about god we actually like did stuff for our radio show man if you didn't 
[00:14:00]  hear uh club soda kenny telling uh people out of one of the cosmo magazines one of those women's  magazines about how the elderly uh can spice up their sex life he it was worth the price of  admission right there absolutely also uh we discovered al roker having fun with epilepsy  yeah for some reason it was okay for al roker to um make fun of epileptics and then uh make up an  excuse that he wasn't making fun of epileptics he was making fun of the olympic logo for london 
[00:14:30]  yeah but um i don't think he was talking about the olympic logo twitching and flopping around on  the floor it was very hypocritical considering the stuff he said about imus and how he won imus  fired and he's sick of people uh like imus uh just going for the easy jokes and uh making fun of  people cruel jokes he said right right but he was making fun of epileptics yeah so uh we discovered  that and uh the big news uh steve decided to shave his eyebrows yeah so yeah some of the things 
[00:15:00]  we've been doing in the last 30 days uh the vince mcmahon thing uh anthony what's going on we've  been following this very closely the last uh few days uh again i was tuning into all the news stations  oh but you know me i'm a news hound i love going to the websites i go to all the news websites i read  blogs um and then i turn on the news i i have my head buried in the newspapers magazines everything  still and i don't even know how many days this is oh our expert on this situation uh sam 
[00:15:30]  is uh coming into the studio but not a peep from the conventional media the only place i'm seeing  uh uh reading about vince mcmahon's death apparent death they're hinting that he is dead at the hands  of a murderer yeah who planted a bomb in his limousine which incinerated his body now if you  were going to kill vince mcmahon sam by the way why would you want a lot of attention on the actual  uh incident wouldn't you do that this in like when the the cameras were all off 
[00:16:00]  that would kind of throw off the investigators because they wouldn't have much evidence they  wouldn't have video evidence they have video evidence they wouldn't have video evidence that  makes it look so freaking fake with a fake leg coming out of the limo fake leg it happened after  a wrestling taping well it was live not taping oh it was live yeah live but it wasn't live  because we we we did some investigating with the wilkesbury police department we found out that  they flew in pyrotechnic experts and they blew up the limo a day early matter of fact they blew it up 
[00:16:30]  a day early before vince was even in town i want to know it was a little trickery with the video and  making it look like vince walked into a limo he certainly did but then they cut to the limo that  they blew up the day before i want to know who flew in and where they got this other limo because  obviously on sunday they had a different limo that they blew up as practice because they blew up  vince mcmahon's limo live on monday so the pyrotechnic experts practiced blowing up a limo on sunday  and then like the real murderers blew up vince's limo on monday uh yes i believe that is facts 
[00:17:00]  they could have they could have killed vince and tried to make it look like an accident like they  were going to blow up a limousine yeah uh for some other something completely different and then  decided to uh get mr mcmahon into the limousine and then blow it up yeah so i i don't know i'm just  still stunned that uh fox news cnn all the local news outlets are still respecting the privacy of the 
[00:17:30]  mcmahon family by not even mentioning this yeah and also there's not a lot of information to get into  yet because the investigation is still video of his limo blowing up well uh sam that's another  thing i want to get into the investigation itself yeah um as i read can you remind people before you  bring the latest facts into this anthony that they they they flew the wwe flag at half mass up there  at uh their stanford headquarter yes they did not the american flag no not the american flag that was 
[00:18:00]  high up on the uh flagpole which led me to believe you know perhaps they realized the flack and heat  they would take that if vince mcmahon was not dead uh to fly a flag at half staff for a uh uh for a work  for a you know a a storyline storyline would probably infuriate yeah people that um  uh know the rules of flying flags at half staff especially that we're at war yeah yeah how do you 
[00:18:30]  explain that one well i told you he's a patriot first and foremost above everything he was a  patriot first and then a billionaire second and i know that vince would not want that flag  flown at half mast he'd want it up as high as it goes in the sky uh-huh okay and and of course the  wwe flag half mass because he's it's symbolic the chairman yeah um okay now now the investigation  itself yeah um i had read that the federal probe expands fed now they showed a picture i've seen this 
[00:19:00]  this guy he's rifling through papers and files i guess in vince's office yeah and he looks um like  a wrestler dressed like a federal agent i would disagree he looks like a federal agent all right  well you know that's all subjective i guess but now i remember reading that the fbi was taking over  this investigation from the local wilkes-barry police department uh because obviously the wilkes-barry  police department just incompetent handling this investigation so the feds had to be brought in 
[00:19:30]  now i'm seeing perhaps because the fbi was denying that this ever happened and if there was a an  explosion where someone was killed in a car they would be involved in this along with atf um they  are now saying that is it's the federal investigation center well they've kind of switched they've kind of  switched that from the fbi did now that kind of leads me to believe just just little i'm being open 
[00:20:00]  minded here that the fbi called up the wwe and said could you not say the fbi is involved in this  because we're not yeah we don't want to be involved with your shenanigans with your shenanigans you do  whatever you want but don't say that the fbi is involved we'll explain that one we're trying to work  on like anti-terrorism and things like that we don't have time to field phone calls about vince mcmahon  in his exploding limousine and his fake death so now it is the federal investigation center  thick thick thick is in charge of uh the investigation sam obviously happened uh-huh was that the fbi was 
[00:20:30]  getting nowhere you know nothing has happened since monday all right so they had to bring thick in and  people are calling them and saying what's the word and they don't know so they're making things up  and we have to bring in other federal authorities to really all right sam well you just said that now  give us some background on fic yeah do you know anything about investigations have they done 
[00:21:00]  you know something there are also 20 000 shows over the years about every law enforcement division  ever in the history of law enforcement i've seen everything from just ordinary beat cops to the most uh  um like csi those kind of shows where where it's very involved forensics we've had quincy  doing uh uh medical examiner i mean every aspect of law enforcement has been covered the fbi has been  covered in in shows the fbi and the x files things like that i mean you name it it's been covered um 
[00:21:30]  i've never seen the fic show well i don't have any formal information but it's my understanding  that this is a very secretive group well then why are they brought in on the wwe investigation  to comfort people who know who realize that nothing is happening and something has to happen  because we don't even have a body yet well why would the fbi crap out they never just go look  we give up in a week it's only been like a week yeah i don't think they gave up i think the 
[00:22:00]  investigation was taken away from them by the federal investigation center oh by fic fic came in  so it was like that south park episode yeah all right we're in charge now yeah what and the fbi is  you're off the case and the fbi is just going to throw their hands in the air and like again go okay  we're out of here i guess they know that fic is above them yeah we got the head fic uh i don't know  guy here daniel beck is is anyone above fic in the federal government as far as investigating what 
[00:22:30]  about the like the cia probably not because i've heard of the cia oh okay and since you haven't heard  of fic they gotta be higher okay well we got the head of that's we got the head of fic uh making  a statement from the fic center it's in atlanta it's in atlanta yes of course they're all in it  about that okay here's what he has to say about the uh investigation my name is daniel beck and i'm  the federal investigator in charge of this case unfortunately unfortunately this is still an 
[00:23:00]  open investigation so we will not be answering any questions relating to this incident at this time  thank you  we need answers  what we need answers was that the media it's frustrated reporters  i didn't realize they got steve to play one of the reporters up there well stanford actually uh the  guys that were the reporters somehow we're all bigger than steve yeah and we're working out i guess 
[00:23:30]  you know uh writing on a pen with a pencil on a pad really works your biceps because these reporters  were huge they're the best of the best really were huge as a matter of fact if they lose their jobs as  reporters i think they could be wrestlers i really think as long as they could be wrestlers as long as  somebody's alive to hire them ah okay i'm hearing they're they're looking at king kong bundy is this  true he's a possibility he's a possibility any other real solid suspects or persons of interest as i 
[00:24:00]  like uh does fic call them that because i know the fbi again we don't know a lot about the federal  investigation center like the illuminati yeah and why can't they find a body not even a piece yeah  nothing well all the eyewitnesses talked about how extremely hot that fire was and apparently it was  so hot by the way body was completely we got the fake uh uh eyewitnesses that's not what they were  described as we got the fake eyewitnesses eyewitness accounts and they're all truck drivers truck driver 
[00:24:30]  that worked for wwe well yes they do happen to work the uh tv trucks because that's where  his limo happened to be part great we got truck driver one truck driver two and truck driver three  these are our our eyewitnesses how about cameraman one that was videotaping the whole thing yeah what  about him i think he's one of the best eyewitnesses yeah because all i hear from the truck drivers  and you'll hear in these clips is how they felt an intense heat yeah get the interview from the  cameraman and he'll say here's what i saw right they told me to stop filming the limo after vince 
[00:25:00]  mcmahon got in then at that point we cut to the limo that we blew up the day before sam comment on  the cameraman my guess is they're probably in custody oh they are probably under a gag order of some sort  to not talk about the event publicly charlie philly's asking if uh david caruso is the lead  investigator of fic none well frank it seems this situation's getting hotter and hotter  yeah all right here we go here we go here's uh one of the eyewitness accounts it was the end of 
[00:25:30]  the evening it was a little longer show than we normally do it was about three hours i was up on  the back of the truck starting to unplug some of the satellite trucks and some of the sound gear and  all of a sudden the sky lit up like a volcanic eruption there was heat that could be felt and  there was this huge eruption and it was the limousine exploding not maybe 150 feet in front of  my truck you could actually feel the heat coming off of the paint as it burned on the car now 
[00:26:00]  i've been studying the video uh for a while now and we had taz on the phone yeah because we're doing  our own investigation oh yeah and taz uh was uh concerned about his own car that was parked about  70 feet away from the exploding limo right the the video i'm watching there's not a car to be seen for  about a mile obviously taz was confused yeah taz can be confused sometimes and we've been backstage at  some of these wrestling events they all crowd into a little area with their own cars you know the vince 
[00:26:30]  limos and and the wrestlers come in with in the suvs they're all just actually line the um the drive  out yeah and they cheer at some of the wrestlers uh who drive their own vehicles and stuff and then  the limos that pull out so why was vince's limo so far from anything it pretty much looked like it  was in an open field there sam which is which is impossible if you've ever been to a wrestling event  yeah there's a big chain link fence behind it and i don't think you'd park a limo there why would 
[00:27:00]  wouldn't vince want the limo in the venue well ever since losing his ecw world title vince has been  somewhat uh despondent yeah and so it wouldn't surprise me that he's been doing things as far  away from other people as possible sam you bring up a good point could this now i hate bringing this  up i know how how you feel about vince and and if the mcmahon family is listening i want to voice uh  my apology for even saying this is suicide a question here i don't even want to talk about 
[00:27:30]  that okay i don't even understood understood begin to think about that or maybe vince finally  realized that he looks completely ridiculous with that shaved head of his those hairs growing in  it's in him he's in the middle phase it's not working out and he's so vain we all know that that  he probably decided you know what i'm gonna take a month off ten in the bahamas my hair will grow back  all these go with the world so cynical i mean he wouldn't have blown up in his limo then yeah  here's another uh eyewitness account eyewitness account well i was sitting in my truck 
[00:28:00]  getting ready to begin loadout and out of nowhere a flash of light came over the bumper of the truck  and a huge explosion that shook the truck back and forth hopped out of the truck and i could still  feel the heat as this as the ball of flame was rising into the air was burning the hair on my arm  there was nothing we could do it's we tried to get close and we just couldn't get close enough to  do anything guy's believable by the way an american flag is not allowed to be flown at half mass without  a government proclamation right right and since he's only presumed dead and finally the last eyewitness 
[00:28:30]  account we gotta take a break here but standing out back of the arena um with the rest of the truck  drivers waiting on you know waiting on the show to let out waiting on time to for load out everybody  to get their stuff and get the heck on um so we're standing there all of a sudden mr mcmahon comes out  gets in his car and boom the whole thing blows up it was absolutely the largest explosion i've ever seen  in my life glass everywhere doors off hood up trunk back it was a disaster standing there looking at 
[00:29:00]  everything i have never seen anything like that before in my life i just basically admitting that  the experts did a great job blowing up the limo yes the day before vince got in it well it is  confirmed that a criminal party engineered the explosion the next question to answer is how the  scheme was carried out to fill in the blanks regarding the specifics uh wwe.com contacted patrick c  riggs a veteran explosives expert from brooklyn uh watching the video blast riggs was able to 
[00:29:30]  determine that it was a professionally structured calculated blast i knew it however since most if  not all usable evidence seems to have been destroyed riggs claimed that not everything he says can be  guaranteed whoever did this knew exactly what they were doing no amateur would have had the knowledge  to create an explosion to that intensity without prior experience and knowledge of explosives such a  blast could not have been constructed so precisely so which wrestlers have experience in in explosives now 
[00:30:00]  that's where they should be looking maybe that's where fic is uh is looking i would assume that's  exactly where they're looking all right sam we should interview the guy that runs ted's dangling left  leg shop in looks bare pennsylvania yeah fake legs specialize in dangling left and dummy legs  a store full of dummy legs ah all right sam that's still enough and then we got the fans now coming out of  the woodwork and they're so distraught they're falling over i saw that uh this morning anthony oh and people 
[00:30:30]  are just uh distraught they've set up uh like a little memorial with pictures flowers teddy bears  at titan tower there uh at titan towers of course yeah they've set it up people have come from thousands  of miles away uh one gentleman was in a powder blue uh suit jacket with the old wwf logo on it uh and  his friend said he would strut around like vince mcmahon he was inconsolable crying his eyes out two of his  friends had to actually carry him away from the situation he was shaking quivering yeah uh but again 
[00:31:00]  none of this on any of the news no thank god all right well respecting the privacy of the mcmahon  family well sam's on it sam are you investigating this is this like taking up most of your time yeah i  think uh my next batch of evidence i'll be looking at will be on uh smackdown tonight  well that's where you gotta go i'm sure the next clue will be on smackdown wow do you think fic is  gonna be there oh yeah i think is gonna be at smackdown watching people probably pointing at trying  to find suspects yeah profile it yeah they got a profiler on this i hope so yeah so do i sam is uh 
[00:31:30]  way on it and we're not patrice o'neill has entered the studio we got the hard rock uh restaurant there  cooking breakfast for everybody we got the cleavage girls on the couch just kind of looking pretty  we got bear in the the green room we got our father's day giveaway today yeah we got so much  to do let's take a break and regroup and we'll continue with opie and anthony hear what everyone  else is talking about ona uncut and live continuing the show on xm satellite radio starting at 9 a.m

[00:38:00]  we're fishing these two uh the horsey the horsey and the finger majig  the x and the o hey speaking of which uh this this makes sense here uh wally from harrison new jersey  oh my god you guys gotta see jill nicolini's fun bags today we were talking about that in the office  the uh the uh the traffic girl here in new york city she does uh local traffic for channel 11 
[00:38:30]  and uh she's trying to find conservative outfits in her closet and she just can't good luck so i  think what she does is she she finds two slutty outfits and puts them together to make one conservative  outfit but it's not working because you can still just see all of her wares and it just it annoys the  anchor woman to no end the anchor woman and uh linda church we love her she's a fan of the show but  she's getting uh she's getting uh she's getting a bit up there in years and she knows it she's a  fan of the show yesterday jill nicolini's uh traffic outfit oh she has they have her doing traffic like 
[00:39:00]  it's weather yeah because it's like beginner traffic a beginner weather i guess you do the  little traffic and then they move you into the the weather position but that never happened on tv  they they would do weather like that in that format but traffic was always done by either the  helicopter or you know a big fat guy just kind of sitting in a room with tv monitors and he would  tell you what the traffic is but she's doing it like standing up like you would in front of a weather  map yeah she's standing in front of a bunch of uh animated streets and a little animated cars that 
[00:39:30]  are driving by and telling you where the the jam ups are yeah there's no reason for her to do that  aside from the fact that she looks great and they just want to put her yeah they're on tv they're  getting her ready to be the weather girl it's so obvious and linda church knows that and the other  morning uh jill nicolini was wearing something just completely ridiculous like a tight-fitting like  uh sort of light sweater thing and everyone's eyes were just staring at jill uh in the office and then 
[00:40:00]  they went to linda church to do the weather and we've been in that studio linda church kept having her  eyes move all the way to the left as she's trying to do her weather report because she's still looking  at jill nicolini going how the hell is she getting away with this what is she wearing what is she  wearing do you think she just comes in because for the most part you only see her from the waist up  that she's just wearing little boy shorts  just killing everybody in there the cameramen and none of the executives are going to tell her  no not to just come in and you should be able to wear whatever she wants harumph harumph harumph 
[00:40:30]  harumph harumph give her a promotion i like that girl she's got spunk  she's on the fast track to be an anchor woman oh yeah she doesn't seem like to seems to be that  bright passing a lot of judgment on the intelligence of pretty women today she's a long island broad we  love them anyone from long island yeah you are say what town there you go east islip wow come on i 
[00:41:00]  live there there you go i went to timber point elementary school is what's yes what's the uh  relativeness uh in terms of uh black and white neighborhoods what's what's at that when when i  live there it was a long time ago it was uh it was very white is it still i know white people are there  now yeah but i'm saying in terms of what area would it be would it be upper east side would it be like  the middle of the bronx it's so hard it's so hard to equate city to suburbia out there it's just 
[00:41:30]  middle class white it's equivalent let's say to black people i don't know it's very local so i'm sorry  but like it's equivalent to white people as wine dances to black people which is probably the blackest  area of um east islip is very like very upper uh middle class white people you would live in i lived  there wouldn't we're talking now yeah yeah i i would live i would live there i would live there 
[00:42:00]  you would live in east like you buy a house in east islip yeah patrice considers that a good gauge  but then again i lived in central islip which is the opposite which is a different yeah yeah  there's like a mason dixon line in between the two you're being very careful well we gotta be for  a while i'm just trying to get a gauge of what east islip is i know it's all long island i'm just  trying to figure out why are you tempting us you you're insane i gotta move back into this slowly

[00:48:00]  never even attempted if she was 425 you would have went over there and just said like hey you  that's what i was catching him in i was catching him being the mister hey i'm not like these guys  talks and yeah and i and so he goes she goes i know her sister what does her sister look like  he said the sister was a mess yeah he openly said to everybody in the room right in front of her too  in front of the cleavage girl that her sister is a mess she didn't disagree and defend her sister  not one second by the way so i did not not one second i just said i looked different 
[00:48:30]  no you didn't when we said she was a mess you just went i guess now i'm an exception now she  now that's what i said now if her sister's a mess and she looks lovely i looked at her for a minute  and go okay i see where at the by the mercy of god she could have been retarded looking you  understand what i'm saying like are you going to patrick swayze patrick swayze's brother thing  that's what i'm saying all right she she got an extra gene that her sister didn't get and you  can see where it is you can see her face is is there as you know it's going to say if you 
[00:49:00]  squint she could look uh half or two i'm saying if you were if you were her boyfriend if you  were her boyfriend after or whatever if you were somebody else with her for a few years  eventually you go oh what but not but that's not how the hell does he even say something  like that because women first of all they're not like us i know you look at me i'm a fat mess  but we're not talking about me we're talking about late i'm saying guys are visual she's lovely 
[00:49:30]  but i'm saying you can see you could do if you turn your head sideways three times you can see  okay she could have been her sister in the blink of an eye by the grace of god she's not a sister  well what do you because you were trying to say something you don't seem too happy with that  i don't want to i like and i understand what you're saying but i don't see it in her i understand  what you're saying but is it the forehead but she just keeps going on and on with it yeah she's just  like she's getting upset what bothers you patrice the forehead where we at it's it well yes she's a 
[00:50:00]  little she has a mongol like a she's beautiful you idiot oh my god she's a beautiful girl you're  basically saying you were this close to being a waterhead and i want to know why you're saying  a waterheadness see they sent me a good cop bad cop but obviously the waterheadness i'm talking about  but she's lovely there is nothing i i don't even understand what you're talking about if i was her  i would have had her hair i'm saying thank you guys for not leaving me like that 
[00:50:30]  look she's got a ponytail going i would be so proud to be with her but i'm saying after  a couple years i'd be like any of us would be lucky to be with one of the cleveland girls  she's lovely all right wow you're saying that because you're just a hater i'm not a hater  i love you okay i love you too i do i i really do but you shouldn't be able to fit my hat though  oh my god she's so mad this is what i like this is what i mean i want them to hate you first 
[00:51:00]  and then you bring them down to love that's all you can switch it up i wanted to have some feeling  because i know she's used to the goofy long island guys going you know way uh jennifer  you're looking there really hot day so that's what i'm saying i let them be for a little while  hard rock johnny brought the cleavage girls in and brought the food in today we we thank hard rock  johnny from the hard rock and uh we got the girls from the bunny ranch get on the couch oh oh now we 
[00:51:30]  got like this around wow this could turn into a wwe match we got the cleavage girls and we got the  uh bunny ranch and the bunny ranch girls dignity versus smart moves that's the name of this group smart  moves and dignity in this corner and 120 pounds doing what they should do to their 50  the bunny ranch girls bunny ranch girls versus uh the cleavage girls versus i will not be  objectified in any matter can we get a cat fight going on today or something 
[00:52:00]  what's the cat fight that's doable do you have any jello or and or ky jelly  now ask the cleavage girls you'll get a different answer  i'm gonna tell you the i didn't the server girl she's she's complete she's she's a trooper but you  can see her face she has hopes and dreams it's just it's useless it's useless you're already  saying it's useless for them to want to be something in life because women are always 
[00:52:30]  defined by how we feel about them but they're always fighting it why not be an object of desire  till you're not it's then bartending saying that one is futureless and one's retarded  and this show started by us saying how beautiful the cleavage girls are by the end of the show  they're gonna be messes that's just my own all right back to the bunny ranch girls what i love  about them we asked them if they would cat fight they didn't even have to say yes it was like well 
[00:53:00]  what are we gonna cat fight in that's their that's what they need to know i like jello you like  jello flavorful do you hear that yeah and it's not listen to her voice there's not even a sense of  like i'm making myself look like a fool she's like jello i saw her the other night at the comedy  cellar and i said like you were talking about big a and what they did with big a and how she got her  hand like oh my god that's right i'm like wow that was really cool and she goes did you hear it on  the radio i'm like oh god i was there with you in studio oh you don't recognize us to begin with 
[00:53:30]  hold on exactly yeah me i didn't recognize her all right hold on uh jimmy brings up a good point we  gotta we gotta tell the story again that the last time we saw them they came in to help out big a  big a is a nice guy monstrosity what you're gonna say a good match for his sister probably or  he's he's a very big gentleman he has a speech impediment he uh he sweats profusely sweats like 
[00:54:00]  an animal makes his hair look greasy and yeah he's a a bit overweight a few things were retracted  inside like deep yeah yeah yeah yeah well well sometimes sometimes uh fat people people that are  very overweight man don't qualify a stink to any other fat no no no no i'm not i'm not i work very  hard to get the crevices no no i'm not even talking about that sometimes people uh uh get so  big and the fat collects around a certain area that it becomes an innie oh becomes an innie and 
[00:54:30]  that was the least of his problems that day by the way no it kind of was because it was almost like  they were uh what is that thing you got to do with the catfish oh where you noodling oh no it was  like they had to noodle it was like they had a noodle for it they had a noodle to find the cat  and there's the picture down the fat around it to get it to kind of right yeah yeah like a balloon  animal all right where you twist it and it goes and then we just felt like we needed to take care of 
[00:55:00]  big a and the girls happen to be in town for the bunny ranch they're beautiful obviously  and um after about two hours they had to give up on big a nothing was going on yeah and then my knee  got tired and then my arm yeah yeah yeah yeah and uh what's your name bunny bunny bunny uh ran out of  the studio crying i wasn't crying i had i went to go wash my hands yeah her eyes were watering from  just gagging well we followed you into the bathroom and there was some puking or attempted puking going 
[00:55:30]  on that is so sexy the bad choice she made in her life and it's just she's dealing with it what a  soldier yeah she did deal with it her eyes were tearing uh it was it was like when they put you  through basic training and make you take the gas mask off in that room everything's running out of  her eyes not to mention the entire bottle of hand sanitizer i went through afterwards after i washed  my hands like 20 times yeah and then no bottle i guess the point i'm trying to make here bunny has  pretty much seen it all oh yeah over the last year or so right look at her face and she's really 
[00:56:00]  making a a hostage face could that have been one of the worst experiences you've had to do  since you've been in the business yes it was the smell i'm not i couldn't i couldn't i don't know if  i can answer that wow really there have been like worse it had to be worse could have been worse  what was the worst one what what was worse what was worse not a mammal what was worse than running  out of the studio we thought crying but you were gagging and puking in the bathroom because there  was a smell and there was also something that was just left on your hand that has never been seen 
[00:56:30]  before some wealthy terrors but he couldn't have been i don't i don't know if legally i can say it  on the air yeah what your worst experience yeah it's a little it's a little nasty it's really  now what was the deal scarring traumatizing do you know how to write of course not  how about we place charades buddy all right if you know how to write write it down make us spell  jello first what's the right with jello right it write it down a little and uh... worst experience

[01:06:30]  we have a real good hang today  that's for sure  tomorrow's the big day  the opian anthony traveling virus comedy tour  hits jones beach  on long island  patrice o'neill in studio  helping us pump the show  jimmy norton of course here  uh... later on i think bob kelly's stopping by  rich voss  uh... bob sag is supposed to call in and uh...  and talk about the show a little bit today as well  uh... tickets still available  i know after the show today if you could find us  after this portion of the show  uh... we have a hundred tickets to give away to the show 
[01:07:00]  at jones beach tomorrow  right  brought to you by bud light  always worth it  we got the girls from the bunny ranch  funny ranch they're doing a great job uh...  this morning for us  they're now on the pal talk camera  who cut their heads off  fingers it's e-rock  e-rock  what's the matter with you  well i i went with the long shot  and e-rock's got the tight shot  it's got the tight shot  so it works out  all right all right  i see what you guys are doing  you're working together as a team today  i was saying they look like the girls from the shining all grown up  come play with us danny 
[01:07:30]  also we got the cleavage girls over there  uh... we're leaving them alone for now  and uh...  and the one girl's really mad  because she doesn't want people to really think that she might be close to a waterhead  aww  absolutely not  she's beautiful  she's very attractive  i didn't come up with this  look like scurls  watch out  i bet she does really well behind the bar  oh of course  i bet you really like  you get like regular guys that are always in there like uh... trying to pick you up and stuff  yeah but um... it's a tourist area so it's kind of hard 
[01:08:00]  it's like you get people that want to talk to you they don't speak you know they don't really speak english  yeah  uh... i'm going on to the next person like  well how long have you been working at the hard rock  um... since our grand opening in august 2005  okay  wow  very good  and uh...  if voss was a woman that's what it would look like  what  the insult  it's not an insult  that you're flinging it  that's not an insult  you think voss would make an attractive girl  yeah i do actually  voss is sexy 
[01:08:30]  yes  oh god  voss said he's a dummy  but i mean he's just something attractive about voss  he's a great little body  voss will be here any minute too so we'll have to beat him up a little bit today  but teresa had a very good observation about uh... catch a predator and then we gotta move on to bear  and the other fathers  hopefully giving away the trip to the bunny ranch  i'll just say real quick  me and my man was just talking about this like  because you watch it it's getting repetitive  the guy coming out  so instead of like having him come out and interview  just when they set him up and the guys come to the door  just have a 50 year old woman come to the door and the guy goes 
[01:09:00]  he's like  you ain't 13  he just hangs himself out to dry right there  but you said you was 12  remember that stuff i've been the pictures i sent you of me naked  and what  who are you  how great would that be  who are you  or a fat retarded girl  hi  wait a minute  yeah they gotta get a little more clever  are you  as far as catching these guys  he didn't know what he was there for you  exactly  that's really funny 
[01:09:30]  that's a very good point  hey let's meet bear  and then we got the uh... we got bear from man vs wild coming in in about 20 minutes  this show is way way too packed today  and we have steve who's a bear  a lot of bears today  patrice  bear den  meet bear  cleavage girls meet bear  bunny ranch girls meet bear  uh... this guy uh... no offense bear but but pretty desperate  he's uh... married with four kids  he's got the big house  he's got the wife still  hasn't had sex  in twelve years  because uh...  wait you're married and you haven't had sex in twelve years  yeah my wife and i haven't slept together in twelve 
[01:10:00]  not even slept in the same bed right  no  no there's too many cats  and there's an update on the cats  you said fifteen three  and then i tried to get rid of  they found their way home  oh no  eighteen cats  he's a dude's dude by the way  eighteen cats  wait  so the eighteen cats just ruined the house  they ruined the house  uh...  say  go out in the yard  they were in the neighborhood  so you married the cat lady  so you give your neighbors a feedy guy  that's what you do  when they roam the neighborhood  if she feeds me  bear what do you think of these girls 
[01:10:30]  like these are potentially some girls  my heart's pounding right now  well  i'm pounding right now  yeah  patrice  and we had his wife on  i know look at this  i knew this would get to patrice  oh just wait patrice  we had his wife on the show a few days ago  yeah last friday  last friday  and uh...  she's like yeah  if bear wants to go to the bunny ranch  i'll welcome him home  with a big hug  i'm not gonna lie to you dude  you have a  you have a very like  you could be in the mob type of look 
[01:11:00]  you have a very like  a tough guy thing that you can ride  that i don't understand why you just said  forget life  like why is life done for you  why do you stay with the cats and the chicks  get out of there  and of course my four daughters  kids  how old is the youngest  twelve  and that was the last time you had sex  jesus man  it's all about my daughters  you know  i don't want to like  i know we're not on oprah  so i don't want to get deep like that  but it's  i don't want to be  i don't want  see that's his mom  he's a dude's dude 
[01:11:30]  but you should get deep like  if my kid needs a band-aid  i want to be there to put him on  you have a  i want that male figure around  if i were you your wife would need a lot of band-aids  jesus  she's had one over a crotch for twelve years  i want to say  he definitely has a  has a  fetal position cry in him  yeah  he's a nice guy though  it's not easy  you know  i work hard  i take care of my kids  but basically in my relationship i'm a paycheck  you know  do you have the basement done up 
[01:12:00]  is the basement done  where  she actually has the den downstairs  that's her room  can you bring women home if you want  no i wouldn't  i wouldn't disrespect my kids  no no no i'm just saying  sneak them up  you don't care what i do i mean  about three in the morning  patrice  no it's not even about that  he's he's had opportunities to cheat  and he will not do it  wow  so not even bringing girls over  to the house  he could do this  to try to get a relationship going  with somebody  now you're taking money  away from the kids  you know  and  we're not talking relationship  yeah well 
[01:12:30]  well even if  we all pay for  you all you men all pay for it somehow  so i see what he's saying  look at this  angry angry mess over here  i'm in love with her  you're just waiting for me to take it all out  that's true  you  but she's right if it's just out to dinner  yeah you need to be strapped  you need to be strapped to our bed  with our sports sheets  and whipped profusely  that's what you need  wow  excuse me  i said you need to be strapped to our bed  with our sports sheets  and whipped profusely  you need my giant black hands around that ponytail 
[01:13:00]  getting reparations for slavery  we can do that afterwards  the only thing i'm concerned with  i mean bear is a great candidate  this is our father's day giveaway  lucky father's going to the bunny rancher  for two days  which is crazy  yeah  um  he's losing his compulsion boy  oh yeah  and your wife did say  we got the tape  she don't care  she doesn't care  she don't care  they don't want to give you a great trip  and then you come back  and all of a sudden you're facing a divorce 
[01:13:30]  and it just wrecks your life  that's not going to happen  that's not going to happen  that's not going to happen  all right patrice  let's go  even if it did  hold on bear  i love this guy  how much more damage can be done  exactly yeah  but his story has a problem here  what  the kid  you're on radio  talking about how you getting ready to go  to the bunny ranch  and do your thing at the bunny ranch  your kids have radio  this is what i'm saying  the whole thing where i'm a great guy  you're getting ready to go  to the bunny ranch  which is a  it's a  it's a 
[01:14:00]  it's a cat house  it's a bravo  it's like  i know you're not using his real name  but  it's like  if your kids hurt  they'd be like  that's daddy  so why not get a square broad  to just come on up  and sneak up at me  a couple of days  and do the square thing  cause they're drama  cause we're professionals  and we do it better  he probably told his daughter  he's going away  like what guys were doing there in prison  like i was away working  for the government honey  he'll just say he's going away for work  yeah yeah  i'm with fic  yeah  it's just a trip to las vegas  yeah bunny ranch  sounds like a fun place 
[01:14:30]  with rabbits  and easter oriented things  we raise furry little bunnies  for kids with kids  you know how many calls we get  on easter  to call and see if we have bunnies for sale  yeah  it's ridiculous  oh we do  we just don't want him to suffer  after this  yeah that's what  he's suffering right now  the man hasn't had sex in 12 years  that's suffering  bunny ranch girls  talk to bear a little bit here will ya  i think these two days at the bunny ranch  are gonna make up for  at least  or  you know  you made up for about seven years  right now just looking at you right now 
[01:15:00]  well for the next  i just don't understand how you go 12 years  afterwards  thank god  i mean there wasn't any point in time  where you were like  if i was married and i wasn't getting laid  i'd be like  no you have to have sex with me  you have to  i'm gonna rape you now  you didn't hear  you didn't hear the wife  you didn't hear her  we heard her on the phone  yeah  and she is miserable  yeah  all she would talk about  was taking care of the kids  and her big house  and then we said  we actually asked her  do you love bear  and she went  ah  ah  ah 
[01:15:30]  and then  and then it was like  why  why don't you give him  some sex  because it's your  marital duty  or something like that  and she was like  because i don't need it  i don't want it  is she makeover sexy  like  she's supposedly  a good looking lady  i thought she saw her  no  she  she explained her  she explained herself  it's only fair  she's a very good mother  what  where did it all go wrong though bear  we still can't get to the bottom of that  the second one of those kids came out  we tried for an hour the other day 
[01:16:00]  last week  and we still don't know  kids ruin everything  it's  it just went out the window  it's just  we had the kids  and  she just didn't want to give it up anymore  she lost total interest  you know  and you fight about that  and things start  you know  he would send her flowers at work  when she was working  i i would get yelled at for that  you know you're wasting money  or  hey let me add  by the way  because we got into his wife's deal  she's not seeing anybody else  doesn't want to see anyone else  and doesn't even take care of herself  she was raised religious 
[01:16:30]  she has no  religious  so it could be a physical thing that's going on  she has no want for sex whatsoever  no it's religious  she was raised very religiously  she said  and she was  that crap was drilled into her  she doesn't like that  three guys in her life  and bears in third place  oh that's right  she had three guys  in her entire sexual experience  forgot about the guy from the bus station  you know  oh  she had three guys  i'm about ready to take bear in the bathroom  and take care of him  patrice  poor guy  yeah we're catching a flight at one  can he just come back with us  yeah 
[01:17:00]  well we're going to another place in about an hour  that we could get some things done  if you guys are serious  don't even mess with us  but his wife had three men in her entire sexual career  and then we said  you know what place he comes in  and third  i'll tell you why  out of the three guys  because of flowers  and he  you're the least favorite  you know why  because you're the best dude  the other two guys treated her like garbage  and that's why she's in love  you're a good dude  it's time to do a little living for yourself big bear

[01:24:30]  he's  bear needs it  he wants it  his son needs his father to have it  he wouldn't mind  but bear needs it  yeah bear's gonna  he lives with cats  but i think this guy needs it more than you think  really  he has a different personality  yeah definitely  he needs it more than you think  because he's got his hands are folded  they're behind him  he's  he needs it badly as well  he just doesn't want to come off as desperate in front of his son either  well we're gonna have some questions  he's like i'll come off desperate  well let's talk to the son again for a couple of seconds  knowing your dad as well as you do

[01:26:00]  oh  things like that  but otherwise  hey Pacino pose  all right tony manero  there's a hole in the Mona Lisa's eye  in the next room  the girl's going  is that iMovie  he has a picture of an iROC Z  and it's just  the hubcaps cut out  he's just  there boss  why do we have a picture of Mona Lisa in his room  it's a 21 year old player  and boss has him with a picture of the Mona Lisa 
[01:26:30]  oh Lisa  oh he doesn't know any band after the Drifters  you don't know  it was almost brilliant  it was almost  the concept of it was great  i'm trying to change it to iROC Z to make it make sense  yeah yeah  well again now Joey  Joe B you gotta return the favor for your dad  you gotta get him some action on your own  if this doesn't work out today  you gotta bring an extra girl home  or at least keep your door wide open  teach him how to use the internet 
[01:27:00]  something  yeah you gotta use something in return  none of the girls you mess with have single parents  yeah i don't know  i don't really like that  a little weird  have you ever looked into mail order brides  huh  mail order brides  yeah  mail order brides  dad even wants that  he's like bride  he's like  I'm talking sex  I'm talking marriage  but you know they're really handy  you can keep them in the closet  bring them out when you need them  they cook clean  little dusty Czechoslovakian girl  coming in from  hey bear's getting nervous over there  the listeners are chiming in on the phones  and they have feedback like crazy 
[01:27:30]  they're like oh don't forget about bear  don't forget about bear  no  i still  bear  i'm telling you  his aura  his aura  he needs it dude  he's down and out  he is  i can't  i love these guys  but dude  you gotta get bear something  they're both shaped like the fetal position  that's how much pain they're in  you know  you know it's actually  you know what these guys got going for them  is you can almost  by talking  live vicariously through your son's life  a little bit 
[01:28:00]  bear has nothing  he has nothing  he can't do honey  he's gotta sit and listen to  about like  the 12 year old girl stuff  but that's where  but hold on  but hold on  that guy got cheated on  and also living through your son is also more frustrating  because you see what could be  yeah  that's frustrating  when you watch a young kid bringing home  really hot chicks  at least bear just says  ah my daughters are doing good  i'll focus on this  yeah i don't think  he's gotta see these hot broads  that he knows his son  and i don't think bear's wife cheated on you right  no  never  the cheating thing is 
[01:28:30]  the cheating thing is a rough one man  she's just withholding  she's cheating on him with nothing  with nobody  is what she's doing  right  at least she knows that  18 pussy cats running around the house  yeah  18 cats  why do you need to come to the cat house  you've got a cat house of your own  yeah  i'm leaning toward uh...  george kennedy myself  are you really  i think so  the cheating thing is a rough one  and then she's still in the house  he has a  and then he doesn't do anything about it  because of his son  that's rough  opie  george kennedy has a  he has a getting some vibe though 
[01:29:00]  see this is the thing  you gotta understand  women ain't like us  you can talk and personality your way into something dude  you still practice having a personality  you try to be funny  you still got your thing  you're chewing gum  you're trying  well and he's getting a divorce  and bears he's staying in it  he's chewing gum goes on his resume  that's true  he's trying to be like he has a personality that i think can get him something 
[01:29:30]  he can charm his way into something more than i feel bear could right this second  i don't know bear that well but right this second george kennedy got some type of charm  i can definitely see him getting a hot piece you know after the divorce  you know  you know what now i'm leaning toward bear after that explanation  it looks like george kennedy still has a little game in him  you know what i'm saying  bear would go high  and she'll get the lamborghini  and she can sit shotgun  bear is like the scene of vanishing where sandra bullock goes in  i just wanna show you something in the car 
[01:30:00]  bear carries a fake cast with him  what are you like a 12?  about a size 14  Mom, maybe you can help me with this couch.  We're here.  We're here.  All right, listen, we got a break.  I love that guy.  Any other fathers here, or is it down to these two?  These two.  All right, it's down to these two.  It's either George Coney or Bear.  We don't know what to do.  We're going to have the girls ask him some questions, I think, coming up. 
[01:30:30]  And then we'll see who really deserves this trip to the bunny ranch for Father's Day.  Can't both, like, cut down one?  No.  No.  That would be, like, Oprah-like.  All right.  Everyone gets a car.  On our show, someone has to suffer even more.  All right.  They do, the listeners.  Right.  These two should have a Bravo film crew behind them.  Thinking, thinking.  I don't know.  Thinking.  Thinking.  It's a reality show.  Forget it.  All right.  I actually didn't know what you meant. 
[01:31:00]  No, we weren't even trying to beat you up.  I was just trying to get the reference.  I actually didn't know what you meant.  That's all.  Yeah, you psyched for tomorrow there, Rich Voss?  I'm looking at it.  Can't wait, man.  Are you drunk?  Yeah, what'd you drop?  A little off the equilibrium there?  What happened?  You dropped them.  Did she say equilibrium?  Which one's that equilibrium?  Equilibrium and you're amazed.  Wow.  She just said equilibrium.  She's not as dumb as we think.  I know.  Something's going on, you little homies.  Something's going on, yeah.  All right.  They're not really hookers. 
[01:31:30]  They're the pretend ones.  Oh, I love her.  You're not tanners either.  We're going to regroup.  All right.  So, Bear, are you getting nervous over there?  You all right?  Yeah, I'm good.  You're fidgeting a lot.  What's up?  He don't want to lose it, dude.  Bear, there's nothing George Kinney's going to say.  I love him.  His son's a good-looking dude.  He's a cool dude.  I'm not leaving.  There's nothing you can say to make me leave Bear, dude.  Really?  Well, good.  Then I'm sure, Patrice, you'll be at the Bunny Ranch ready to help out. 
[01:32:00]  Or why don't you go take his wife's place?  I'll put Bear's booty down.  Is Man vs. Wild Guy here?  All right.  We're going to talk to Man vs. Wild Guy, who's another guy named Bear.  We have a lot of Bears in the studio today.  Maybe this guy's testosterone will put some magic in the other Bear.  All right.  We're going to regroup.  But tomorrow at Jones Beach there, Rich.  Excited?  Can't wait, man.  It's going to be great.  I can't believe it's here again. 
[01:32:30]  Nope.  I'm just setting up giving away tickets.  I don't really care what you think about tomorrow.

Not to be confused with our own Bear who's sitting over there hoping to go to the Bunny Ranch. 
[01:34:30]  No, this guy probably doesn't need any help.  He's in this bowl.  What happened?  30 to 60 seconds, he's in this bowl.  Oh, really?  Is he on the bowl?  He's near it.  What is he in there, drinking his own pee?  Trying to survive?  Yeah, I was going to say.  The guy's conquered Everest.  He's trying to conquer the toilet.  I might not live in this building night.  Here it comes, Bear from Man vs. Wild. 
[01:35:00]  Yes.  Oh, that's rolling.  Oh, God.  Polar opposite of Bear.  French Foreign Legion.  Hey, Bear.  I hope you're not intimidated.  There's a lot of people today, but we got a busy show.  I almost tripped over some lady in a very scant outfit.  You think you could conquer her?  How do you survive, Dad?  Hey, listen, I'm a dad.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll keep it.  I could win that for Father's Day.  I got a bear.  Who, can you build these two guys a girl? 
[01:35:30]  We've got to start by saying this man right here, Patrice O'Neal.  Bear, he turned us on to Man vs. Wild.  We're all hooked.  I love this show.  Thank you.  The new season's starting, what, on Discovery, what?  Tonight.  Tonight, right?  Tonight, 9 o'clock.  And he's going to be in the Everglades swimming with alligators.  Alligators.  I saw the show.  You're insane.  Just when I think you're kind of have done everything, you'd come up with a new thing.  It's amazing, dude.  Amazing.  Thanks, thanks.  That you would know how to survive like that. 
[01:36:00]  Now, what?  I've seen...  We're quite on the limit now.  I think the producers for this last season, they thought, okay, you've just about coped  in this last one.  Let's push the boundaries a bit for the locations.  Yeah.  And genuinely, I feel I'm quite on the edge now.  There's not a huge map.  Did you do Compton yet?  Hey.  Did you do Compton?  Did you jump out of a plane and land in Compton?  No.  But you know what?  We're doing...  For the next season, we're going to do an urban one.  Really?  Which I think will be great.  You know?  How to get stuck in an elevator or burning buildings.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you really?  You'll get mugged in downtown L.A. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Trying to survive it.  You want to hit Reginald, Denny?  Just stand at the full book side.  I say Lebanon with a yarmulke.  I've seen people try to go into the waters with alligators and stuff, and it just looks  very murky, very dark, and you don't know what the hell is down there.  I don't even like swimming in water that you can see the bottom in, because I always think  I'm going to see one of those big monsters that live under there.  You got to get the heebie-jeebies thinking, you know, if something brushes against your 
[01:37:00]  leg, that it's something that's going to take your leg off.  I mean, you know, it's not fun.  No.  There are over a million alligators in the Everglades, and I remember doing one swim  across this river where, you know, I've been seeing alligators all the way down this river,  and they could stay under for like 45 minutes, and I had to cross this river, so I stood there  for 45 minutes, couldn't see any bubbles, and thought, you know, right, I'm going for it.  And I could kind of justify all the reasons why this should be okay.  It's the right time of day.  They're not mating. 
[01:37:30]  But ultimately, I just had my knife in my hand.  I thought, I'm still having this in my hand.  Yeah.  What's your name again, dude?  I'm sorry.  Bear.  Bear.  Bear.  Bear.  Bear.  Now, here's the problem, though.  I watch both of you guys.  I watch Survivor Man.  Of course, that's your competition.  And here's the problem.  I haven't seen that.  You haven't seen it?  Well, Survivor Man is kind of like you, but he's a little, he's light in the shorts.  Like, you're like the dude's dude, like, oh, this tree.  I'm going to punch this tree in the face.  He's like, you know, you've got to be careful of the environment. 
[01:38:00]  When you're eating a snail, you've got to apologize to his mother and all that.  But he does what you do.  Now, here's the thing we had a discussion about.  Yeah, but I watched Survivor Man after you told me about him.  He's out of shape, and he's, ah.  This guy took elephant stuff, squeezed it, and drank elephant.  That's what I'm saying, but here's my thing.  Survivor Man takes, he takes, it seems like he just takes one.  He tells his crew, look, here's where I'm going to be in seven days.  If I'm not there, come looking for me, okay? 
[01:38:30]  You look like you have, like, when you're up in a tall tree,  it looked like there's another dude in the tall tree, another tree.  You got, like, angles and shots, so you got other people with you on the shoot.  Yeah, he brings a camera crew.  But that's what I'm saying, it's very, you know.  Well, he's trying to film a TV show.  I love the guy, but I'm saying it's like, you know.  You know how to do it completely on your own and film it completely yourself,  but what you don't get is the action stuff because you can't kind of film it  unless you can do all the action in one hand.  He's a grizzly man when he makes a great scene at the end. 
[01:39:00]  Now, would they help you if you were ever in a death, life or death situation?  Yeah, if I'm about to die, you know, if I get bitten by a snake,  they've got radios, I've got anti-venom helicoptered in in ten minutes.  But if really it's kind of, you know, life or death, I can get out of there.  And the camera crew flies out.  But there are very strict instructions not to, you know, interfere unless really it is kind of like that.  Has there ever been that moment where you're like, fellas, I'm getting woozy.  I think I'm going to die.  And that's kind of always the premise is how it's sort of, you know, set up. 
[01:39:30]  But they're great guys.  They've become real friends this whole year.  And we've been through an awful lot.  And they go back to a hotel or something, and he stays in the middle of wherever he is at night.  And then they come back the next day.  I've got to set up like a crew base camp, you know, how many miles away.  And that's where they'll go in the evenings, give back all the footage, recharge camera batteries,  leave me a little camera for the nighttime.  So half the time, I'm filming it on my own.  That's probably why the footage is a great fit.  And you do another show like you're in the French Foreign Legion or something, right?  And I did one where I joined the French Foreign Legion with the camera crew, 
[01:40:00]  and we just told the story of what it's like for somebody off the street just to join up.  There's really a French Foreign Legion?  Yeah.  I thought that was like cartoons, Bugs Bunny.  I thought it was just in a Van Claw, Jean-Claude Van Damme video.  Van Damme.  Van Damme or whatever.  I'll tell you what, have a bad life getters, guys.  Don't join the Foreign Legion.  Really?  When the animals hear you talk, do they laugh because of that accent?  What can we really do to us?  And they just like pluck you and keep walking.  You're so brave.  This guy could kill you. 
[01:40:30]  Are you kidding me?  Hey, look, come and sit over here.  Hey, what degree of, what's your specialty, martial arts-wise?  Well, I did karate ever since I was a little kid, and I'm second damn black belt in that,  and I do ninjutsu.  A second damn black belt.  That's even, that's almost, you can't learn.  But listen, I'm a big pussycat, really.  Wait, a second damn black belt.  What is that, second degree?  You're almost Chinese.  Is that second degree? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's a high level, man.  He climbed Mount Everest.  I want to talk about that a little bit.  When you were 23 or something like that, early 20s?  Yeah.  And on the way down, some of the people that you went up with died?  Am I hearing that right?  Yeah, we had four of the guys we were with and not come home.  Jesus.  But you knew these people?  Or were they on another?  They were guys we were just climbing with.  Yeah, they weren't kind of best, best buddies.  But, you know, they're, yeah, it's a British guy, New Zealand, Russian, and American.  Wow. 
[01:41:30]  Great climbers.  They're, you know, great climbers.  And it just shows how much element of luck, actually, there is up there.  What happened?  Was it a storm or?  Two fell.  And one died of the cold.  And the other died of the cold, yeah.  How long were you on the top for?  We were on the whole mountain about three and a half months.  And we were on the very summit for about ten minutes.  That's it.  That's all I meant.  You just look around and go back out.  It was 92 days of climbing over 12 hours every day.  Do you need oxygen?  Lower than minus 60 degrees. 
[01:42:00]  Can I bring this to racial for a second?  Yeah.  Is it possible?  Now, a lot of jokes, a lot of racial jokes.  And the thing is, black people feel, like you talk to black people, white people do a lot of unnecessary, this kind of stuff.  So what I'm going to ask you is, what is the drive at 23 to go, you know,  I am going to do something that may kill me.  You understand what I'm saying?  Like, I have no drive to, I go, thank you for doing that, sir, so I can know what it's like to do it, living through you. 
[01:42:30]  But what makes you, what's that drive?  What's that thing growing up where you go, I'm going to go in the bushes and.  Ask the girl that lays under you.  Jesus Christ.  That should have gotten a little bit.  It was something.  Like, why did you learn how to, like, I saw him just bite into a live fish, you know what I mean?  It's just like, what's the drive to learn and want to just do that, man?  I think, yeah, I think a lot of the big sort of full-on life-threatening expeditions and climbing stuff have done, 
[01:43:00]  and I think it's much harder to really pinpoint the drive afterwards because so much of it has been spent, you know, up there.  Do you have any black counterparts, peers that do it like you?  No.  No black guys to climb Mount Everest, is that it?  There's got to be a black guy to climb Mount Everest.  I bet you it's not.  I'm sure there is.  We have one black guy with us in the SAS, and that was, even that was pretty rare.  Yeah, and I always wonder, because you're all, you know, you're such kind of superb athletes, naturally, really. 
[01:43:30]  You know, so much stronger and fitter and bigger.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy's Greek all over again.  Yeah, he's the same.  It's the same with rugby.  You know, do you ever watch any of the, you know, British rugby stuff?  You know, it's really kind of full-on, full-on stuff, and I always think, I wonder why there are not more black guys there.  That's a big thing in America for us to sit around in a weekend and watch rugby.  Rugby's.  If we're not watching cricket, we're watching rugby.  I wonder why there's no more black guys there.  Yeah, it's just a total.  I wonder the same thing when I'm playing golf.  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:44:00]  Black people just don't like nothing.  As a role.  Maybe as a race.  Yeah, I'll give you something.  You know what I think it is, actually?  I think as a remote race, maybe you're less kind of messed up than us, you know?  I think you're just happier with kind of, you know, life and, you know, families are much important.  And I think you need to be a little bit messed up to really, you know, I definitely could do with a bit of therapy.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  And it's a crazy element to want to swim with crocodiles.  You know what I mean?  It's just an element of why. 
[01:44:30]  Maybe because black people have more dangerous things growing up and in city situations.  And white guys typically, and again, typically don't have that.  So you have to find adventure.  Whereas, you know, if you grew up, it could be an adventure right out your front door.  You know, if you walk into the bodega, you made it.  And the tour guys don't want to take them to the mountains because they say, no, they're not going to get tipped at the end of the hike.  And if you're laying in the, if you're shot in the gutter, you go, you know, maybe I can survive on a cigarette butt. 
[01:45:00]  Well, he does some crazy things to survive.  Someone is bringing up the point that you ate a dead zebra.  I did eat a dead zebra.  It was an amazing moment.  How do you know that it's not?  It was about 4 a.m. in the morning.  And I was in Kenya in the African savannah.  I've been walking all through the night.  And I came across, literally it was a lion kill.  And the zebra probably just stumbled across, you know, pride of lions.  They're taking it down.  He said zebra.  Zebra.  Zebra.  What's wrong with zebra?  Sorry.  I had to bring that up.  Zebra. 
[01:45:30]  In stupid America, we say zebra.  And he cooked it in some aluminium.  Hey, listen, everything's forgivable.  And he took his trousers off.  Anyway, the lion, you know, drank all the blood, ate all the soft organs.  They went off to get something to drink, see if it got so much protein.  And literally, it was still, it was like an hour ago it had been killed.  All the meat, most of the meat was on it.  I could cut it from there.  Wait, so you snuck in and took a lion's dinner while he went in for a beverage?  The lion went to the ice machine and he went and snuck in and took some throat.  That's why this guy's...  I didn't hang around long. 
[01:46:00]  I was at it a pretty pretty good.  You cooked it, right?  Of course, you cooked it, right?  No, no, I just ate it straight off the neck and then it was off, you know.  And then the crew gives you, like, a sandwich or something, right?  You're just taking a bite for the show.  Wow.  I rough it for those three days.  As soon as it's finished, I'm on a kind of, you know, plane bag, nice fight to the hotel.  It all gets great.  A nice cup of anti-salmonella and E. coli drink.  Yeah, you must have to get a lot of shots when you go to these places, huh?  Yeah, I've got a lot of things sort of inoculated in me. 
[01:46:30]  See, Anthony, that question you asked, that's what I'm saying.  The point of the show, right, is for just in case I accidentally fall out of a plane in a jungle.  Right.  It's for me to know how to live.  So if he's taking shots, if he's doing things that he can survive, pre-falling out of a plane by mistake.  It's not the die of malaria show.  But he should be dying.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  He saw a lion eating and he goes, do you mind if I explain that? 
[01:47:00]  I'm not marginalizing this, man.  I'm just saying it's got, like, you're supposed to be trying.  It's in case I get stuck by chance on top of Mount Everest and I need to live.  You're saying that he has certain amenities that you wouldn't have.  Malaria shots, something, somebody fly something in.  It's like, how do I live in case I'm in that position?  I just think it's a cool show to watch.  It's a cool show to watch. 
[01:47:30]  But I think he's trying to have a point to the show.  I think it's more so to live vicariously through him than think you're going to be able to, if you fall out of a plane, go, let me look at, let me think back at that TV show and think how I could live through this.  I'm going to squeeze elephant poopy so I can get some water.  Yes, I can get some water and then I'm going to steal a lion's kill.  Right, I'd rather just die.  You squeeze elephants.  Yeah, elephant dung for water.  Well, there was no water.  I couldn't find water anywhere.  I'd be following these elephants all day.  They were pooping everywhere.  And an old ranger taught me when I was doing the anti-poaching stuff about 10 years ago in the army, he said, you can drink this dung because it's sterile. 
[01:48:00]  The face you make, though, when that goes into your mouth is classic.  Yeah, that one is a little rough.  You're like, oh, that's actually well.  How do you learn?  I was squeezing it.  It was all fine until a bit of the actual kind of poop fell off and went in my mouth.  That's funny.  If you only knew how much we have in common.  It's so weird not being yelled at in German when that's happening. 
[01:48:30]  Now, did you almost stick your middle finger up when they asked you to do season two?  Like, you were like, why?  You know, I did everything.  Yeah, almost.  Well, one of the most amazing episodes I saw, you were, like, sliding down some kind of glacier or something, and he had a knife.  All he had was a knife to slow him down before he went over the side or something like that.  All right, that's a little crazy.  Alaska.  It was Alaska.  The helicopter dropped him off at the top of some kind of a peak, and he had to get to the bottom, to the valley, to follow the river out to the water. 
[01:49:00]  See, I know the show.  Great.  He's watching it all.  Yeah, you follow rivers, and they lead to something, and then, you know.  Watching him up loud, though, that dude, he's. . .  Yeah, but all of a sudden he decides, I'm going to slide, and the camera crew were not. . .  He wasn't doing test runs, and he knew he had just a knife to slow him down.  I seen it.  I watched it.  Wow.  I watched it because it was him or Survivor Man.  So, it's amazing stuff, dude.  Nah, it's crazy.  He's more exciting. 
[01:49:30]  Man vs. Wild is great.  But Survivor Man is more like, you feel like he might die.  Do you have survival groupies?  Like, they go, oh, my God, he knows what trees they eat.  You wouldn't believe the kind of madness out there.  Really?  They all have hair on their own.  Nah, I just try not to get involved in it.  I'm just. . .  I find it quite upsetting sometimes with people who go, you know, when they're rude, you know.  I just. . .  I'm not really used to TV and everyone suddenly knowing everything about your life.  Yeah, that must be funny.  Somebody just said, listen, don't get involved in all that stuff. 
[01:50:00]  You ever show one of those. . .  The jungle women. . .  You're uncircumcised Britishness?  I bet you women.  That's a bit of the rudeness that he was just talking about the trees.  What do you think?  Do you think jungle men are cut?  You don't get ripped?  See, I can relate to you.  Jewish jungle men.  Hold on.  Vos got something.  No, no.  Because I was stuck on Nantucket Island once for like a day.  Yeah.  And we ran out of money.  I had to like steal cigarettes and stuff.  So it's. . . 
[01:50:30]  It gets tough out there, right, Rich?  It's great.  Vos does a lot of risky island hunting.  It's fire island.  That's risky, all right.  What about the. . .  Yeah, I saw the episode, I think you were with the icebergs and in a boat.  And it sank.  And it sank.  And basically you had, I don't know, a minute before you would freeze to death.  It's called the Titanic.  That was quite. . .  You know, I was running out of options a bit on that one.  Yeah.  And I had, you know, again, Simon, my camera, I was with me in a full submersive suit just  in case, you know, the boat had gone or whatever.  But it just started leaking after about half an hour. 
[01:51:00]  And suddenly we were just surrounded by icebergs and everything.  It was like, you know, 400 meters to the shore.  Yeah.  And it just then just went. . .  And about three minutes, everything sank.  Wow.  And it's, you know, because it's ice, sea ice, it's colder than normal ice.  Right.  You know, the freezing temperature.  Now, is it possible for your whole boat to die?  Oh, my God.  I literally arrived and just crawling and shaking out of this beach just thinking.  Your body. . . .  I've got to get a proper job.  I need a decent . . .  Was that the closer you came to maybe something happening?  Yeah.  That was quite on the edge, I think. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  But I do spend a lot of the time thinking, Bear, what the hell have you got yourself into  here?  And. . .  Yeah.  I definitely need a big job.  Well, that's a better job.  Well, then he, like. . .  I'm not going to kill you.  He finds stuff to rub on his skin to keep the mosquitoes away.  Like, how do you. . .  That's good.  Yeah, off.  The biggest spain of my life this year has actually been mosquitoes, you know.  And I've been to the jungle a lot with the army and, you know, you have all the. . .  Mosquito.  I love it.  You never go into a jungle without a mosquito, not a hammock, machete, basic. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Again.  And I think I kind of underestimated, actually, the discomfort of. . .  You know, it's not the big things, the crocodiles and the snakes, that you kind of manage.  You see, it's a mosquito.  It's just day in, day out.  The size of your thumb, this thing is just kind of attacking you.  Yeah, but when we get, like, bit on the ankle, one or two, we're miserable.  How many bites have you taken?  I've certainly had, you know, a thousand big mosquito bites.  At the same time?  All at once?  Well, over the year, you know.  That's torture.  It's been a full-on.  Yeah, but. . .  But you rub some kind of bark or something on you in your arm. 
[01:52:30]  No, that sort of. . .  It does, you know, it does work.  And then you burn termite crap and stuff and that.  How about. . .  Ultimately, it's pretty, you know. . .  How about ants?  You have a problem with ants?  Ants, actually, out of all the things I've eaten from kind of dung and to sheep's eyeballs  to snakes and everything, ants are actually tasty.  I didn't mean eaten.  I mean, like, things that are attacking you.  Well, you're right.  I mean, ants actually.  Why do they attack you?  You eat them.  Ants are the. . . .  It's just misty attacking.  Ants are the kings of the jungle, yeah.  When the ants are on the move, they clear everything.  So, yeah, you want to watch out for ants. 
[01:53:00]  So, how do you. . .  Let me ask you. . .  You squeezed elephant dung for water.  You were taught that.  But who was really thirsty enough to go, it's worth a shot?  The guy that was ready to die of thirst.  The original white man who decided to drink elephant dung.  It doesn't look like it's a quencher.  What are you, Seinfeld?  Who was that guy?  What was the. . .  What was the. . .  What was the. . .  Hold on.  What was the worst thing you ate?  I think sheep's eyeballs on this last season, well. . .  You know, I always thought if you eat an eyeball, it's going to be like a hard-boiled egg.  But literally, it's like. . .  Crunchy. 
[01:53:30]  Puss and blood.  You know, it's just. . .  Oh, God.  Man, we had a guy do that on our show.  Yeah, there's like. . .  And we learned it's crunchy.  It's chrome in there or something.  Like a hard. . .  And there's like a lens that you have to bite through.  Exactly.  It's literally like gristle.  It's really tough.  Why'd you eat it?  Hungry.  Hungry.  So when you're in civilization, when you're doing the civilized thing, going out to dinner  and all that, what don't you eat?  You know, I really make up.  When I'm back, I really make up for it.  Room service.  Send it back.  It's not hot enough.  Yeah.  I thought he went to a steakhouse, threw the steak on the floor. 
[01:54:00]  Step on it a little.  I'll be under here, honey.  You should be behind a plan.  All right.  I went for a quiet dinner on my own last night at a summer restaurant.  All these guys were coming up going, hey, I want to sit with you and eat steak.  And I'm thinking, oh, God, I just really want to sit quietly in the corner.  Go away.  I don't want to do this.  Have a sort of salad.  A lot of sponsorship.  A lot of. . .  All right.  It's an amazing show.  The big plug, Man vs. Wild starts up again tonight on Discovery.  That's great.  What can we look forward to this season?  We know about the alligators.  Eyeballs. 
[01:54:30]  Stuck in the middle of the outback of Australia, 145 degrees, 100% humidity.  Drinking my own pee for two days out there.  Wow.  Ice in minus 40 degrees.  Sleeping inside deer carcasses to avoid freezing to death.  You lived in a deer carcass.  Wait.  He lived in a deer carcass, I believe, for a night or something to keep warm.  It was basically dropped up on the high mountains in Scotland.  And a storm came in.  And I just didn't have the clothing.  And I planned to get off the mountains pretty quickly.  Night came.  And I was about to say to the camera guys, listen, we're going to die up here.  We need to get proper help.  The show stops, you know. 
[01:55:00]  And then I found this deer that had fallen down a cliff, died, gutted it, slept inside  the carcass.  Ah, Han Solo did that to a tauntaun in Star Wars Return.  But listen, I'm also a very normal guy.  I have a normal family, a lovely wife, two little boys, you know.  So I'm not...  Oh, it was Empire.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  Well, that's...  It's great.  When's it starting?  Tonight.  Discovery.  The second...  Third season.  Second season?  Second season.  Second season.  We'll talk tonight for the next six weeks.  Fair.  We're all fans.  It's been a pleasure. 
[01:55:30]  Thanks.  Fair from Man vs. Wild, everyone.  Take care.  We're going to give away a trip to the Bunny Ranch next.  One of these lucky fathers.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got a lot of energy today.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Tomorrow, the big day.  We're all very excited about the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Show happening at Jones Beach.  You can go day of the event and get your tickets, by the way.  Yes.  We got the tailgating, the ONA Village.  It's just going to be an all-day thing. 
[01:56:00]  And then after the show, I believe we'll be doing a meet and greet and signing and taking  pictures, all that fun stuff.  Let's say hi to Carol.  Carol, what's going on today?  Carol, what's up?  You made me laugh so hard.  First of all, you got this black guy on named Patrice, which is a girl's name, and he's fighting  with Jungle Boy.  It was, I cried so much, I couldn't put my makeup on.  Is that your wife, Bear?  No. 
[01:56:30]  Well, thank you, Carol.  Carol's enjoying the show today.  Speaking of Bear's wife, we do have her on the line.  Let's get this going.  Louise.  Let's figure this out.  Where's my microphone?  Hi, Louise.  Yeah, get a mic on Bear.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, Louise?  Done.  We haven't talked to you in about a week.  We got Bear in studio.  He's looking at the...  He said, you can call me back.  He never called back.  Oh, boy.  Well, here you are.  Bear is looking at the girls from the Buddy Ranch.  They're in studio.  They're lovely.  Bear's digging them big time, and he's the front runner for the big trip to Nevada. 
[01:57:00]  Good for him.  Yeah.  Yeah, good for him.  Good for him.  And you don't care?  Yeah.  Good for him when he sends you to a hospice in Wisconsin.  Wow, he's enjoying his life.  God, I can't wait.  Bear, talk to your wife.  Hi, honey.  Hey, what's up?  Not much.  I'm having a lot of fun.  Nice people up here.  A couple of beautiful girls.  Nice.  Beautiful girls.  Kit-Kat Club.  Are you enjoying yourself?  Yeah, I'm having a good time. 
[01:57:30]  Good for you.  All right.  Good for you.  How's that...  Oh, go ahead.  Louise, go ahead.  Actually, I was calling about the tickets for the concert yesterday, but tomorrow.  Oh, no.  Oh, you want to go to the show tomorrow?  Yeah, that's what I was actually calling about.  Yeah, he's calling about.  Doesn't she sound like that girl that Tony Manero danced with in Saturday Night Fever?  You know, I bet if you help Bear out, he might get you tickets.  I'm sniffing her out right now.  Are you going to take Bear?  What, Bear? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, I was going to say, are you going to take Bear?  Are you going to take Bear to the show tomorrow?  It's just about dancing.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got too many things going on.  Let her answer on the phone.  Are you going to take Bear to the show?  No, I'm taking the kids.  What about your husband?  Don't you want to please him and tend to those needs that he has?  Do you have a husband?  No, but I tend to plenty of men's needs.  12 of them.  I mean, if I don't have a husband...  Hold on.  Hold on.  If you have a husband, I didn't want to please...  Let's put it this way.  It's women like Louise that are keeping these girls in business. 
[01:58:30]  Yes, thank you.  Thank God for women like Louise.  That's what they're talking about.  Oh, you do.  Or don't do.  All right, wait, wait.  So, Louise, why are you asking these girls if they have a husband?  I'm sorry?  Why are you asking these girls if they have a husband?  Good question.  Because they don't know what it's like until they have one.  Do you have a husband?  Well, no, but I mean, I know that...  Several hundred.  I know that I'm not going to get married unless I want to have sex with the person.  Yeah, I got to tell you...  But wouldn't...  You have a hundred husbands?  Hey, Louise, I got to tell you one...  Oh, yeah, we serve husbands every day, sweetie.  Everybody's my man, baby. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, I got...  We're the best wife.  All right, enough of you parrots!  All right, listen.  I like these two.  They're giving it to us.  All right, listen.  Louise.  Louise.  We all have met Bear.  He seems like an unbelievable guy and a really nice father.  Unbelievable.  A wonderful gentleman.  Very nice father.  Very nice husband.  He supplies the money, I guess, for the family.  And you kind of don't give him what you should be giving him. 
[01:59:30]  She's abusive.  No comment.  Yeah.  She's calling in trying to act like she wants tickets.  She's calling in because he's about to get a drop of self-esteem.  So she had to call in to make sure that she's going to subjugate his soul again.  Did you treat her too good, Bear?  She likes being treated like garbage.  Louise, her last name should be Fletcher.  I'm telling you.  You hear her silence?  And you see, that's what she came up with?  You like to get smacked around, don't you there, Wheezy, or whatever your name is? 
[02:00:00]  Dude, Bear, I'm going to tell you.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He's protective of her.  You need to get out of that zone, Bear.  I'm telling you, dude.  Bear finally lost his stutter, and she came in yelling, and he got it back.  Yep.  And he's sitting there.  She just subjugate.  Oh, I want tickets.  Oh, really?  You call right at when your husband's on the radio for tickets?  Why not yesterday?  Why not the day before?  Did you call?  No.  Why don't you go pet your cats?  And I hope you love y'all.  Bear, if you hang out with me, dude, you'll forget about you. 
[02:00:30]  I'm telling you.  Stop what you're doing, dude.  She's abusive.  Louise, why not a divorce?  She's not abusive.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Let Bear talk.  Let Bear talk.  Actually, a man who has orgasms is healthy, so that is abusive, to withhold that relief.  That's right.  It's not good for the prostate.  He's the sole provider of her and her cats.  Of course, she's not going to get a divorce.  She takes very good care of the cats.  She's a great mother, all right? 
[02:01:00]  And I'm not trying to sound like a martyr or anything, but that's what's important is  the kids, you know?  What about you?  I mean, I know it sucks that I've got to come after the cats, but, you know, that's...  Yeah, it does suck, man.  But you're not even coming after the cats.  You know what?  Actually, I actually think I've come after the gerbil, I think.  I'm not sure.  I might be after the gerbil.  I'd still want to know what happened with these two.  Abuse!  Louise seems like she's really pissed off at Bear, maybe something he did way back in 
[02:01:30]  the day or something.  Nope.  Nothing?  Nothing.  Nothing, Louise?  That's why those other two guys...  I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt here.  Don't give her the benefit of the doubt.  You can hear it.  She's like the chalkboard scratch scene in Jaws every day.  Y'all know me.  You know I make a living.  I ruin men's lives and their self-esteem.  She's a good woman, man.  She's a good mother to the kids.  She's a good mother to the kids.  But it's you. 
[02:02:00]  We're talking about you.  I'm a big boy.  I, you know, I...  Oh, man.  Wow, he's just beating...  It's like brainwashed.  He's brainwashed.  That's what happened.  He's defending her.  I mean, I can...  I bet she's a great mother for her role as a wife.  She's the mother of my kids, and I've got to respect her.  But she's also your wife, and she'd be...  Yeah, let me ask you a couple questions there.  Louise.  The mother of my kids.  Louise.  Come on in.  Louise.  Yeah.  I'm betting him.  All right, hold on.  Let's talk to Louise for a second.  Are you ever going to give it up to Bear again? 
[02:02:30]  Answer that question.  What?  Answer that question.  I don't have an answer for you.  How do you not have an answer?  Is he either going to someday give him what he's due as a married man or not?  I think what she's saying is that the answer is no.  Yeah.  Nope.  The answer is no, right?  Nope.  But things could change down the road?  No.  Huh?  Anything is possible.  Did you ever try to get her drunk?  Anything is possible, Curtis.  Champagne? 
[02:03:00]  No, she don't drink.  How about drugs?  You don't even just think that even if you're not in the mood for sex, you don't even think  like this guy's been providing for me and my kids for all these years.  You don't have any sense of obligation to have sex with your husband, like even just  for him?  Obligations.  A lot of obligations.  A lot of responsibilities.  You don't, but I mean in 12 years, you haven't once thought in 12 years this guy might  need this for his feeling good and his well-being?  Like are you thinking of yourself that much? 
[02:03:30]  Obviously.  Maybe I'm the least selfish person in the world.  What's that?  I am the least selfish person in the world.  Well, no, no, you are selfish because you do certain things around the house, work maybe,  chores that you don't enjoy doing, but you know you have to do it.  It's kind of your responsibility.  That you should just consider a chore and a responsibility because your husband might  enjoy it and just kind of put it in those terms.  It's your duty.  Yeah, you guys should not be married anymore is what it comes down to.  I hate to say that. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, consummation of a relationship.  I can't wait for the bunny ranch.  I can't wait.  I don't think Bear can either.  All right, let's look into the future here.  Louise, so Bear goes to the bunny ranch in Nevada.  He comes home after a wonderful weekend out there.  What happens?  Nothing changes.  She's going to put him down.  He's going to probably go, you didn't satisfy the prostitutes.  You can't even satisfy a prostitute, can you, Bear?  Oh, I can't wait until you smash it, Bear.  I can't wait. 
[02:04:30]  When you see what's out there, Bear, baby.  Big old Bear growling on those.  Mmm, delicious.  So she's saying nothing will change after a weekend at the bunny ranch.  I'm starting to lean toward George Kennedy again.  Nothing will.  What?  I want someone's life ruined because of what we're doing today.  Oh, it's going to be ruined.  It's going to be ruined.  Of course she's going to say nothing's going to change.  Of course she's going to be like, oh, yeah, I'm fine with it.  When, I mean, maybe it's just that she feels that she's lacking in her skills, which is why she's not providing for him.  You could come, too. 
[02:05:00]  I wonder if she's going to ask how his date went and want details.  Are you going to, Louise?  We'll make her a tape for training.  Louise, are you going to ask specific questions to Bear?  The phone might have crept up.  Jesus.  Louise.  Yes?  Are you going to ask Bear questions about his date specifics?  Of course.  It'll be a good story.  Something else to do?  Yeah.  Bear is.  Yeah, good story.  Bear is.  What's going on over there?  You're gritting your teeth.  You're, like, you're moving your hand real fast. 
[02:05:30]  You're really mad over there.  What's up?  No, I'm not mad.  I'm not mad.  It's just, it's frustrating.  I know what's going on here.  Oh, man.  Bear is still.  I'm very frustrated.  It's a little bit depressing.  Bear is still in love with Louise.  It's very obvious.  No.  It's obvious.  I can see it in your eyes, bro.  In all honesty, I'm not.  No, we're not in love.  All right?  He's loyal to an ideology.  They're both loyal to an idea.  An idea, a family, and they're loyal to that.  But, Bear, you're just dying. 
[02:06:00]  You understand?  I'm going to go sit on that couch.  That's what I'm dying for.  That's what, look at.  And get over there.  Go sit.  Go sit.  And listen to this.  This is your husband getting up, Louise, and sitting next to hotness.  Yes, between them.  He's going to go sit in your past.  The story better say how far it went.  Oh, my God.  So, now Bear is.  There he goes.  The girls and the bunny around.  Now he's got his arms around both of them.  Now he looks comfy.  Hand on the leg.  Now he looks comfortable. 
[02:06:30]  Don't worry, Louise.  You're lagging.  We'll take care of him.  We'll make sure.  Look at him happening.  He's remembering how to touch a woman now.  Yeah, yeah.  He came back.  Like riding a hoe.  Now, they opened up.  I can guarantee you were a better ride than any bicycle.  Yeah.  We'll take notes for you, Louise.  Look at Bear's face.  It's beet red, man.  Oh, look at him licking his lips.  You remember it in his head.  He remembers how sexy he was.  Look at you, Bear.  Look at this, Bear.  Come on.  I got to ask Bear. 
[02:07:00]  I got to ask Bear.  When was the last time you actually touched a woman's arm like that?  Like her shoulder and stuff?  How long?  A long time.  A long time.  And really, it's exciting, isn't it?  Damn right it is.  Isn't that?  Look, he's got...  Now, look at her thigh.  You see him cross his leg?  What does that feel like?  Nice and smooth?  Get a shot.  Get a shot.  Rub your hand right on her thigh, butt area there.  What's that?  Nice, right?  Tell the other Bear to climb that.  See, that's good stuff, right?  Bear, I noticed you crossed your legs.  Is that for comfort or embarrassment? 
[02:07:30]  We're so happy for him.  What's she doing?  Yeah.  Is she still there?  Yeah, Louise is still on the line.  I got it.  And ladies, he's not a bad-looking guy, right?  Louise.  Louise.  Thank you, Louise.  Go do the laundry.  Go do your laundry and pick your cat.  Go clean the cat box.  Feed your cat.  Go clean the cat box.  Feed your cats.  Go do the laundry and then clean up after your kids.  Your husband's here touching an ass.  Go get your...  That's right.  And I'm sitting in front of one.  Go to Rich Barth, ladies and gentlemen.  Hey, go to BJ's and buy a 75-gallon bag of lump litter and some Tide and go do something. 
[02:08:00]  While your husband touches soft, young, supple skin.  That's right.  Oh, look at him.  Go find a therapist.  Wrinkle-free.  Wrinkle-free.  That slow clap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go Bear.  Yes.  Go Bear, everybody.  You go Bear. 
[02:08:30]  You go Bear.  You go Bear.  Wait a minute.  George Kennedy over there.  Oh, damn.  Oh, George Kennedy.  We forgot about him.  Wait a minute.  With a tear on her as I, you think he's a Latin king.  We can't leave this guy out in the cold.  As much as I feel for Bear and as much as his wife is the picture of emasculation, at  least this abuse victim that he's married to never cheated on him.  This guy's wife cheated on him and the kid told him.  At eight years old, the kid told his father. 
[02:09:00]  At eight years old.  So, he should just go out and cheat on her.  It's pretty much my logic in the whole situation.  Well, he could get a free omelet from the Hard Rock.  What can I tell you?  All right.  There you go.  Hey, if you heat it up and roll it the right way.  He's getting a divorce.  I mean, Bear's stuck in this.  I love George Kennedy, too.  Bear's a lifer.  I don't want to see George Kennedy.  Hey, George Kennedy, the food's free.  Have as much as you want.  Bear's could be eating something else.  You enjoy the omelet. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, man.  I'm sorry.  George, I'm so late.  You can enjoy things, compliments of the Hard Rock.  He'll do something that kind of sounds like that.  I don't think that we should.  I don't like leaving him out in the cold like that.  He had a real story.  He had a real story.  What is his story?  No, no, no.  You hear the ghost of Christmas everything ruining his life.  His story, we just don't have the wife with him.  We have his son, who's a good-looking guy, tells the story.  But you can't see his awful pain as much as you can with Bear. 
[02:10:00]  But at least his wife is freeing him.  His wife is saying, all right, I had my fun with you.  I'm supposed to do it right now.  Let's be honest.  Bear has no hope.  At least George Kennedy has a little hope through his son bringing home some broads.  I totally see George Kennedy in a Lambo after the divorce.  He'll get the Lambo.  I'm telling you, they see the same thing.  They don't see you.  They feel for Bear.  You don't see George Kennedy can get a girl.  Hold on, hold on.  Breaking news, breaking news.  Breaking news?  Bear's wife hung up.  Is that going to be a problem?  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  I want to tell you to go.  There you go.  What?  She honestly doesn't care.  Yeah, whatever.  They do deep inside.  Whatever.  Yeah.  You know what?  You know what?  She does care.  Maybe this is my first step now to doing what I got to do.  Hey.  Nice.  This is the reality checkbook that she got to put out.  This is damn good.  Because all of a sudden, you're sitting here, two beautiful girls.  You got your arms around.  You're kind of feeling new flesh on the palms of your hand.  And your wife was listening to that.  And she's like, yeah, I don't care.  And then she thought about it more, I think. 
[02:11:00]  And she's starting to think, you know, you guys are going to go out on a little date.  And things can happen.  You know, more touching.  Whatever.  Whatever.  But I'm just saying, that's sinking into her head.  That's sinking into her head.  What?  He's better looking at every character on The Sopranos, except for Michael.  Right now, his wife is back at the house making words out of cat turds like Alfred  Southert.  You know what?  I don't want to leave George Kennedy out in the cold.  Well, we're definitely against him.  I don't either, but he's not giving two, and I'm not going against Bear. 
[02:11:30]  I just won't.  I can't.  I can't go against Bear either.  I don't like leaving him out in the cold.  When Louise is vacuuming the floor, she can think of the girls from the Bunny Ranch.  I know.  And he can walk home, and hopefully it'll be like the Nicholson movie.  The vacuum running.  The shoe askew.  Slightly askew.  All right.  This is what we're going to do.  We're going to give Bear.  Bear.  Yeah.  I'm so sorry, man.  George.  Oh, George Kennedy.  George Kennedy.  Let's talk to George Kennedy for a minute here. 
[02:12:00]  I'm telling you.  You have one last shot at this, George.  You're going to see the show tomorrow night.  You have one last shot at this.  Why should we give you a trip to the Bunny Ranch?  Sell your case.  Let's go.  Age.  Oh, age.  How old are you?  63.  63?  Oh, that's how we have met.  Well, I'm saying, but he can go to the Bunny Ranch next year.  How old are you there, Bear?  46.  46, and he's 63, so.  But, you know, he's got the rest of his life to find a young, hot, like, 21-year-old. 
[02:12:30]  The chippy.  George Kennedy?  The older man, yes.  Hey, look at George Kennedy.  He's got a tan.  The rest of his life, he's got 20 minutes.  Well, no.  I mean, the light is at the end of the tunnel, and he's getting a divorce.  He's a free man.  He has a tan.  He has like a...  That's right.  He's outdoors.  Why would he be in the house?  No one will sleep with him.  He just stands outside, yelling at God all day.  All right.  Horrible people.  I don't like leaving him out in the cold, man.  Yeah.  Will these guys go together? 
[02:13:00]  Same plane and everything?  Wow.  Did you talk to Bear at all, George?  We don't even know your real name.  You're George Kennedy from now on.  Joe.  Joe.  All right, Joe.  Oh, you having a change of hot oak?  I would like to see that.  Well, if we could send them both out, that would be really fantastic.  Yeah, I would like to do that.  You don't have to, you know, go out on your dates together unless you become good friends  on the plane.  Yeah, we could have separate rooms.  Wouldn't it be hysterical they really get to know each other on the plane, figure they're  gay, and just hook up?  We should ask Dennis if he would do that because... 
[02:13:30]  Dennis would do that.  Dennis, I think, would.  Dennis would do that.  Dennis is a giver.  He's not selfish when it comes to the ranch.  Well, of course.  It's not his property.  Are we allowed to give away two trips?  I don't even know.  I would like to ask Dennis if it's...  Unfortunately, he's not here.  I thought there was a father-son thing.  Get him on the phone.  Call him right now.  Yeah, call him.  We've got to hurry because we've got to get off the air here.  Dennis is a generous guy.  The ranch can handle...  Well, we're talking about a weekend at the Bunny Ranch in Nevada. 
[02:14:00]  A weekend?  Oh, yeah.  A weekend.  A Friday, Saturday night...  And don't forget about Cat House, which is on Saturday nights at 1130 on HBO.  What do they get at the Bunny Ranch?  They get the VIP treatment, basically.  Where is that?  Hold on.  Airfare.  We pick them up in a limo with either me or Brooke with them and a bottle of champagne  or both.  Whoa.  Hold on.  I see something in the rules here.  Airfare for a father and son.  So we blow off Joey B and we go father, father.  Joey can't go.  And then I think it's well within the rules that Dennis Hoff gave us that we could give 
[02:14:30]  away two trips here.  That could be a...  Thumbs up.  Thumbs up.  George Kennedy's going to the Bunny Ranch.  George Kennedy's going to the Bunny Ranch.  Nice.  Or maybe his father's son will just say that...  I'm happy about that, George.  Isn't that great?  Wait, technically this could be your father's son if George got started a little earlier  than he did.  You say that Bear is the father and he just looks like crap.  You say he's 19 and really frightened.  He has progeria.  He's a progeria kid. 
[02:15:00]  Progeria with a pituitary problem.  A big progeria kid.  He's just a big progeria kid, bro.  World's largest progeria kid going to the Bunny Ranch.  This is my 11-year-old.  He was in the Dirty Dozen.  All right.  You know what?  Bear goes.  George Kennedy goes.  Oh, fantastic.  For Father's Day.  It should be that way, guys.  Great Father's Day.  Two married fathers going to have some special dates at the Bunny Ranch out there in the  bottom.  Watch Dennis say no and we get a bill for $40,000. 
[02:15:30]  Anyway, let's find out what he's into.  Hey, Dennis.  Good morning.  Hey, Dennis.  Dennis.  I hope you don't mind.  We just gave away two trips to your fine Bunny Ranch.  Whoa, that's great.  You know, I don't know if the girls told you, but just recently, Hefner did a fundraiser  at the mansion.  This same trip went for $14,000.  Nice.  Okay.  Which two of them would be $28,000.  So we had two fathers here, Dennis.  Both had genuine stories.  We could not decide.  We leaned towards one guy, but the other guy is 63 and his son brought him in. 
[02:16:00]  It's a real story.  The son can't go.  So we figured that the guy could take the son's airfare so the two of the guys could  go together because he really had a genuine story.  His wife was awful.  She cheated on him and we wanted to send them both out.  We couldn't decide who.  Wow.  That's great.  You know what?  I can't.  You guys are so generous with my money.  I love it.  Let me tell you, Dennis.  We couldn't get you on the phone earlier.  You are a giving, giving man.  And this will be a fine Father's Day for these two. 
[02:16:30]  He is a giver.  Well, you know what?  The gift.  They won't have.  They're not going to have to worry about returning that on Monday because it doesn't fit.  Well, that's for sure.  Absolutely.  Oh, my God.  That is funny.  That's a good point, actually.  Good point, Dennis.  Good point.  Here's what you get.  Yeah, we got to wrap up here.  You get an airfare for the father and son, which in this case is Bear and George Kennedy.  Your car service to and from the Reno airport.  You get VIP suites at the Bunny Ranch for two nights, three days.  You get food and drinks.  You get monogrammed robes and t-shirts. 
[02:17:00]  They live at the Bunny Ranch?  Yes.  For two days.  How cool is that, right?  And they get furnished with VIP passes.  It's an amazing weekend at the ranch with a bunch of really smoking chicks.  It's all legal, regular fun dates.  You are going to go home from this and just be a new man.  You are going to tell Louise to just shut up.  Right.  Just shut up.  And look at Tom Chiasano.  And after what he smells like, those cats are going to like you now.  He'll wake up, there'll be 13 on his face. 
[02:17:30]  Dennis, by the way, Bear has already started with your ladies.  I just want to let you know.  Yeah.  You might want to bill us for the dry cleaning.  The meat is running.  You're all looking pretty today?  Yeah, they look pretty.  Oh, beautiful.  They're amazing.  Beautiful girls.  But they're acting a little too smart, Dennis.  I don't like that.  All right, listen, we've got to get off the air here.  On our new HBO show, it's tomorrow night, you guys, bunnyranch.com.  Check it out.  But you know what? 
[02:18:00]  Tell Tom, Tom needs a trip to the Bunny Ranch.  Yes, he does.  Oh.  Look at Tom.  There you go.  He's shaking his head no, but his pants are saying yes.  Tell the girls to rub up on Tom a little bit, and we're going to put him in the Father's  Day package.  Tom did take his tie off today.  Oh, yeah, I know.  He's got the casual look today.  I wonder what that's about.  The girls brought the casual Friday.  Hey, guys, ask him for a raise, too.  All right, buddy.  We've got to run.  We're actually over time.  Dennis, thank you, man.  And the Bunny Ranch, we've got both guys going.  We're very happy.  Bye, Daddy.  Bye, Daddy.  Bye, bye, girls. 
[02:18:30]  Take care of Halloween A.  All right.  Bye, Daddy.  Thank you, Dennis.  Dennis Hoppe, everybody.  Make sure you watch what?  Bunny Ranch on HBO.  Cat House.  Cat House.  1130 on HBO.

[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Oh, you want to tell people or just let them speculate as to why that is?  Let them speculate.  Yeah, this is the last show we're doing from this studio.  That's depressing.  It's kind of weird to be here.  I'm amazed we got through that.  I'm amazed we just got through the last 30 days.  It's, um, I don't think any radio show has ever had that much controversy and actually made  it through.  And, and yeah, in this day, especially in this day and age, squeaked by. 
[02:38:00]  What, what, what, what the hell is going on?  We have a mic out there.  Yeah, there's a live mic out there.  Oh, that's all right.  I don't mind the, the noises.  Well, they're banging a ladder around.  I mean, they can, I can see if they can whisper in.  Are they already like doing construction out there?  Is that what it is?  I've seen holes in the walls and.  Yeah.  Hey, Bobby Kelly.  Hey, Bobby.  What are you doing, man?  What's up, man?  Oh, you're in one headphone and an echo and.  I'm so glad nothing has changed in 30 days.  No, no, no.  Like I have the mic set up. 
[02:38:30]  No one can hear anybody.  Like I said, when we left the other joint, they hand me the, uh, the wireless mic and  headset for the first time in 30 days.  And it's like an old battery and it was feeding back.  Like, ah, great.  Welcome home, boys.  Hey, can I have a raise?  You can't use that mic.  It's like echoey and way in the distance.  Yeah.  Share, uh, share bosses.  Dr. Steve sent me some food.  Thank you, Steve.  For our return to XM, he welcomed us back with food.  All right.  How about that, Mike?  There's some kind of echo. 
[02:39:00]  Sorry.  Uh, what's that?  What's up, Kenny?  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Uh-oh.  Whenever there's a whisper, it's never, it's never good news.  Uh-oh.  What are you saying, Kenny?  Uh, Channel 2 News is here.  Do we want them upstairs?  Yeah, bring them in the studio.  That's how we talk.  I like, I like on the air.  Absolutely.  Kind of a, on the air thing.  But they're late for the party.  Fuck them.  Bring them in.  Bring them right into the studio.  Is there a reporter or just a crew? 
[02:39:30]  I'll check it out.  I was just...  Yes.  We want their credentials.  If there's a reporter, make sure it's a hot dame.  We only talk to hot dame.  We like the broads.  Bring in a broad reporter.  Broad.  Wow.  Okay, how's that?  Something being back, ain't it?  This table full of Santa's broken toys.  Well, yeah.  Well, we got the, we got one, two, three, four.  We got five out of the nine performers tomorrow night.  We got in studio Patrice O'Neill, of course, Jim Norton, Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, and Otto from 
[02:40:00]  Otto and George.  Bob Saget's calling.  He's flying out in a few hours for the show tomorrow at Jones Beach.  And that's kind of what's been a bummer.  Like, the last 30 days, we haven't been able to promote the comedy show to the hardcore  fans out there, man.  No.  All the hardcore fans sitting there, and we couldn't even promote the show, so.  Well, ticket's still available for tomorrow night at Jones Beach.  We're all looking forward to it.  And you can just walk up tomorrow and get your tickets.  And really good seats still available, by the way. 
[02:40:30]  But it sold actually better than I thought it would, considering the fact that our main  promotion vehicle was gone for 30 days.  We've actually done much better there than I expected us to do.  I thought we were going to be sucking wind by this point.  Yeah.  So we got a happy typing girl out there.  Yeah.  Who's now a media darling.  She certainly is.  Yeah, boy, things have changed since we've been off and then back.  She is now the official spokesperson for freedom of speech.  I remember the day she used to come up to me and try to get a picture.  I want to get a picture with her now.  Yeah, she's the one that's in the news all the time. 
[02:41:00]  And it just goes to show you, and believe me, this is nothing, like, I'm not making any  light of anything that you do.  You've worked very hard to do this.  But it just goes to show you how the media works.  Yeah.  Here's a girl that was sitting around folding her laundry on her bed on a Paltalk camera.  And then she puts up a website, starts sending out some emails on websites and stuff, and  then contacting news organizations.  And then the news automatically assumes that she is the spokesperson for freedom of speech. 
[02:41:30]  So they, like CNN and Fox and stuff, have her on.  And then, after a couple of times of doing that, they then automatically go to her whenever  something, a story like this breaks, and she is now the official spokesperson when a freedom  of speech issue comes up.  It's easy to do.  It takes a lot of work, but relatively speaking, to become an expert on anything, piece of cake.  So now, she's the one.  She's the go-to gal.  If I'm having some of a party. 
[02:42:00]  Congrats.  Well, it's Debbie now.  I mean, we can't even call her happy typing girl.  Debra.  It's Debra.  I would call her Debra.  Debra Wolf.  Thank you.  Debbie Wolf.  Thank you to Debbie for doing everything.  I mean, I know it was about a bigger picture than just the Opie and Anthony show, but thank  you for doing all that stuff for the People Against Censorship website.  Oh, she has no headphones.  But I got to tell you one thing.  How about she walks in?  Yeah, come in.  That's a good one.  Now that she's like a celebrity in her own right, she's allowed to hang out with us.  She's debating people.  Keep the rest of the animals out there.  She's had a debate, you know. 
[02:42:30]  She's debating people on CNN, Fox News.  Look, and she was just like, you know, we were trying to get her to take her shirt off  on Pal Talk.  Look, I just got excited.  I'm like, oh my God, that's the one that was the girl.  I know her.  I've seen her on TV.  She's the spokesperson.  It's amazing.  She's changed a little bit.  Her new screen name is Happy Typing Woman.  Woman.  She won't be called Happy Typing Girl.  Hear me roar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:43:00]  By the way, don't let the camera crew just bust in here.  We'll tell them when we're good and ready.  Yeah.  For our close-up.  One thing, Deb, you did a great job.  Great job.  You sounded very intelligent, informed, which was good.  Thank you.  Unlike our own Patrice O'Neal.  But one of my favorite interviews I ever saw was Patrice O'Neal laying out what a donkey  punch was on a national news show. 
[02:43:30]  Who was that, Gibson?  Charlie Gibson show?  Well, because we then had to get on the next day.  John, is it John Gibson?  Is it John?  I was on later that night.  Oh, excuse me.  You know that.  I'm sorry.  You know, they're Ms. Wolfe.  I don't know all the players' names in the media.  Ms. Wolfe.  No, because that guy, he was tough.  I mean, he really...  John Gibson was?  Oh, yeah.  He was hostile.  Was he?  Big time, yeah.  But at least you're welcome back.  Welcome back.  Patrice isn't allowed to go back there.  Yeah, he isn't allowed to go back. 
[02:44:00]  And actually, he had to apologize.  Not Patrice.  But what's Charlie?  Charlie Gibson?  John.  John Gibson?  I couldn't remember his name the entire time.  That Gibson guy.  There's another Gibson that's Charlie, but this is John Gibson.  He had to apologize.  Why had to apologize?  For what Patrice said.  On his show.  And also shows how this type of thing could happen very easily when you're just like,  you know, going with the flow.  Patrice described the angry pirate on the fucking news.  Can we be honest, though?  If you remember, I know it was a while ago, but thanks. 
[02:44:30]  The lady actually started it.  She goes, Patrice goes on describing how a woman gets doggy style.  I was trying to be clinical.  It was from now.  The woman was from now.  I tried to explain it as a guy ejaculates.  I was being all scientific.  Yeah, scientific.  It's coming in your eye and kicking your leg.  That's what the fuck it is.  It's goofy.  And you heard the camera people laugh.  Patrice spins around and goes, what are you laughing at?  What are you laughing at?  You know how fucked up you have to be for the Fox News to say we're sorry for his comment? 
[02:45:00]  They interview white supremacists.  They interview fucking Hamas.  They've never apologized.  They're saying, it's my end.  He does a loathe in the eye joke, and they're ready to fucking yank him off the air.  Oh, it was so classic.  I haven't been back since.  It was a wrap.  My Fox career is over.  That whole shit.  That bridge is still burning.  That mic still doesn't work.  You know.  His resume is like back to you.  That mic still doesn't work either. 
[02:45:30]  His resume is on.  Now the mic might be on.  And I'm glad things haven't changed.  Welcome back.  Quiet.  Is it working?  Is it working?  Yeah, now it works.  Wait, talk.  Seriously.  Yeah, there it is.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I can hear you.  You know, that type of thing we expect on the Opie and Andy show, not the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Andy.  Thank you for the website.  Welcome back.  Anyway, go ahead.  What were you saying?  He told the lady from Now.  Someone said, well, what is Al Sharpton in charge of?  He goes, nappy-headed hoes.  And then she said, what?  He goes, well, you're just in charge of the regular hoes.  Yeah.  The head lady of Now.  Wow. 
[02:46:00]  And she laughed.  She's in charge of the hoes.  He said, why isn't Al Sharpton involved in this?  I said, because.  And your thing.  I said, because it doesn't concern him.  There's not anybody black going on.  And no one counts Condoleezza as a black lady.  She's fucking down with the president.  So I'm like, he's in charge of the nappy-headed part, and you're in charge of the ho part.  Oh, God.  She did not appreciate that.  Oh, whatever.  She hated me anyway, because she tried to bring that goddamn bullshit out the thing. 
[02:46:30]  She's just unfunny motherfucker.  Just unfucking funny.  Well, that's what you hit her with right when you got on the air with her.  The first thing you said is, you are not funny.  He looked right at her and goes, you know nothing about funny.  People, let me tell you something.  You can be funny and not be a funny person.  Like, you could just want funny in your fucking life.  Yeah.  I just want to try to laugh, even though it's like, dude, you stink. 
[02:47:00]  Like, Voss is a funny dude, but he always is bombing.  Like...  Now, why would you say that?  Hold on.  I'm never...  Not bombing on stage.  No, wait, wait.  Not bombing on stage.  But, like, Voss is such a machine.  Like, we was...  Bobby was...  He was just attacking Bobby in the elevator.  And I said, Voss is like...  It's those...  What's those...  The pendulum things on somebody's desk where they click-clack?  Yeah.  If he doesn't keep just talking and trashing you, he'll just slow down and just stop.  So, Voss has to just keep the momentum going. 
[02:47:30]  It's not funny.  But he's a funny dude, man.  He's just a funny dude, whether he's funny or not.  All of us.  So, she don't know about even trying to fucking be funny.  It's awesome.  Everything in her life is serious.  Everything is all fired.  Oh, I didn't say that, because we couldn't talk about it.  Uh-huh.  Before the show came on air, John goes, so, Sonia, what do you think they should do?  Like, she goes without problem while she's just looking at her little papers, I think  they should be fired.  I said, this fucking asshole, just like, needs to be fired. 
[02:48:00]  I'm like, she don't even fucking care.  Where was it now during the Clinton administration?  Now it's nothing but a branch of the Democratic Party.  And why don't...  Wait, why the fuck...  Why the fuck would...  Oh, boy.  Women don't need...  Wait, wait, why would Condoleezza Rice and the president's wife need help from now?  All I know is whenever Vosch's little hand goes up and he tries to make a point, it makes  me sad to you.  Whenever that stiff hand starts shaking, that means poignancy is being attempted.  Let's get...  Hey, let's get...  Brants of the Democratic Party. 
[02:48:30]  Let's get back to Miss Wolfe here.  Now.  Yes.  So, I want to acknowledge her brand new organization.  Miss Wolfe.  I just got the ribbon.  Hey, uh, and you got a lot of people listening right now, so how do they join PAC?  PAC?  Unfortunately, they have to wait until next week.  We've had a problem with our website that's just been an embarrassment.  It's a problem with...  What happened?  Conspiracy.  People are asking, have we been sued by XM?  You know, what's going on?  The website's been down for two weeks.  It's a problem with the German server. 
[02:49:00]  We never expected to grow.  German server?  German server.  Uh-oh.  Talk to the guy I get my porn from.  We never expected to grow from 500 people to 13,000 people in a couple of days.  So, we had a server that could handle 500 people, but then...  They probably can't understand why there's no pictures of people eating dog shit on it.  Bosses lost?  They needed their bandwidth to get the dog shit videos up there, so...  Well, so they kind of hijacked our site, and they're not letting go of our, I guess,  DNS until the 16th. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, wow.  But we'll be back after that.  Why have they letting go of it?  It's complicated.  It's not, you know, my area.  I'm not...  Are they being scumbags?  They're being complete scumbags.  What a shock.  Hey, a lot of people want answers to questions.  I can answer this question.  She's kind of...  Oh, yeah.  You got her in there, Skin.  Oh, yeah.  Did you?  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Can't tell you how many times I had to say, hey, I have nothing to do with this.  Look, I don't know her that well.  I've just whacked off looking at her on Pal Talk. 
[02:50:00]  I can't speak for her.  I hope it helped in a good way.  But I can tell you, without a doubt, you got under their skin.  I'm telling you that for the first time now.  Oh, yeah.  See, we had no contact in the last 30 days with Miss Wolf.  No.  I don't know.  I got to meet a few of them.  I got to meet the spokesperson.  I'm afraid Patrice is going to ask me how I want to be defined.  And all morning, I realized I wouldn't have an answer for that.  It looks good.  But I got to tell you, you know, as we move forward, it's important we have a group like  that watching our back because, you know, there's special interest groups that could get a show 
[02:50:30]  fired.  And watching everybody.  There should be special interest groups that could keep a show on the air as well.  Well, you guys were behind supporting JV and Elvis also.  Yep.  And Imus.  And Imus and any other shows.  And I need to tell you, even Al Roker, if it would come down to it.  I mean, I'd be the first to point out that he was a hypocrite.  Yeah, we don't think he should be fired, but he should probably resign if he follows his  own advice.  We were just wondering why the media didn't pick up on it as much. 
[02:51:00]  And because they're all asshole buddies with each other is the reason why they don't jump  on other media people.  They protect them.  Well, the view yesterday, I don't know if you saw it.  They were talking about this a little bit.  And they mentioned Imus with a scowly face and, you know, the other guys with a scowly  face.  But when someone brings up Al Roker, Barbara said, oh, well, he's not a bad guy.  Oh, he's not a shocker.  I wish somebody like a real, like a black, black station would get in trouble so I can  defend them.  Yeah.  I was just defending middle-aged white guys for that whole time. 
[02:51:30]  You should say white people's job.  Oh, lordy.  You got to keep white people working.  I'm like, can a black dude fuck up so I can keep his job, nigga?  I'm sitting there like, oh, white men got to have a job.  I enjoy you on Hannity and Combs where you're like, come on, Sean, and help me out here.  I got to still go back to the neighborhood.  Sean's like, Patrice, we love you.  Come here.  Give me a kiss.  I'm like, nigga, I can't like you. 
[02:52:00]  You're a right-wing Republican ass.  Fuck out of here.  Even though he's not even.  He comes in.  No, no.  Hey, everybody.  Got to break in here for a second.  We got Bob Saget.  He's going to be at Jones Beach tomorrow night with all of us as well.  Bob, what's up?  I'm very happy you guys are back.  Hi, Bob.  So are we, Bob.  It's hard for me to see you this morning.  My eyes are full of my own semen.  Again?  Yeah, and I also covered my head with some Condoleezza rice.  It's converted.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  You know, these are the puns that you do when you sit on the phone for fucking 90 minutes. 
[02:52:30]  Waiting to get on.  I'm sorry.  Hey, when are you flying out?  I'm flying out.  I'm actually going to Denver tonight.  I'm at the Paramount Theater tonight.  Then I come to you guys tomorrow, first thing.  How excited are you, man?  I mean, Bob Saget, out of everyone, I think, really enjoyed himself backstage more than anyone  in this room.  Bob was out of his mind.  That's one of the first comments.  There were so many comedians.  Yeah, that was the thing.  Sagetisms.  Yeah.  Huh?  He said he was getting blowjobs from all the comedians.  Not Norton, though.  Jim Norton just gave me a quick hand, Duke. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  How are you, Jimmy?  I'm good, buddy.  How are you, man?  I'm good.  I'm looking forward, man.  It's going to be crazy tomorrow.  Yeah.  I'm very psyched.  I mean, we're all here.  We got Patrice, myself.  We got Voss.  We got Otto.  We got Bobby Kelly.  Otto.  Otto.  And Bob Saget.  We're just missing Lynch and a couple other guys.  You know, I'm really glad you guys faked this whole, this radio thing so that we could get  a fucking big turnout tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was so good for the virus tour.  People were saying something like, because yesterday, I guess, Opie on the air said, oh, 
[02:53:30]  what are they doing?  One of those fake suspensions?  Because they're remodeling?  Yeah.  And all this speculation on the websites.  What did it mean when Opie said fake suspension?  Does that mean...  Now you got to figure out every second of what you say.  Exactly.  Every word is ripped apart.  It's just...  It's just...  I just can't believe freedom of speech is so unfree right now.  Wow, man.  I was in Greece, and I just got back, and everybody's getting fucked in the ass.  Who did you play?  Knicky?  Huh?  Oh, sorry.  I was in Greece.  What did you say? 
[02:54:00]  I was in the show.  That was a damn good one.  You said I was in Greece, and Anthony said, who'd you play?  Knicky?  That was a good line.  I did the same joke, but I was talking about getting fucked in the ass.  I didn't mean to cut off the whole dinner theater vibe.  What's great about Bob?  Bob, you're the only relevant guy left from the original Make Me Laugh.  You know that...  Holy shit.  Well, he...  A Gary Mule deer.  Come on.  Shanley was on it, and Howie Mandel.  He was one of the majors, but it was you.  I would say Franklin D. Jai's not even relevant right now. 
[02:54:30]  In Australia, he's very popular.  And if you like, stir crazy.  Bruce Baum.  What about old...  Vic Dunlap.  Old Puddin' Head Bobby Van.  He got hurt, Vic Dunlap.  You know, he had diabetes, so they did some work on one of his legs.  Who?  Vic Dunlap.  He was a sick man, and he's still out doing stuff, but he got hurt.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, Bob was the only one left.  Bobby Van was the host, and I think he died.  And his good-looking wife.  Yeah, he had an old Puddin' Head.  Wait, what did he die of, Bob?  He died of a brain tumor from lack of freedom of speech. 
[02:55:00]  I was having to listen to so many awful fucking jokes.  And they were so bad that you couldn't even sit through a minute of them.  It was in one minute.  It should be, make me bite your fucking face off, because you watch those people, and they  would sit there, sometimes completely straight-faced, and just watch a comic going on and not  being funny.  I watched that when I was three.  Bob was like my favorite dude on there, man.  I loved him, man.  Well, you know what was interesting about one day I came out dressed in toilet paper, and 
[02:55:30]  that guy, Mr. Whipple, that did the Charmin ad, I walked up to him, and I said, squeeze  me, Mr. Whipple.  And he just sat there staring at me, but kept looking like at my dick, because I think he  was that kind of guy.  And it was weird.  He didn't laugh, because I think I was like turning him on, because I was like wrapped in  something he could wipe his ass with.  That guy's a creep, and he's now the super of our building, and he stands outside and  fucking fun blocks every time we try to have a laugh.  He fun blocked today?  Of course he did.  Just trying to hustle people through with his weak chin.  Yeah, he's awful. 
[02:56:00]  There's media from like all over the world, and he's like, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Get inside, get inside.  Move, move, move, come on.  Mr. Whipple is your fucking...  Yes.  Oh, I'm not kidding.  Oh, a dude.  He looks just like that.  Jimmy goes, yes.  Wow, it's such a small world.  All right.  Hey, Bob, so tomorrow?  Tomorrow night, we'll blow it up.  How many people are in that place?  I don't know.  We've got to get a ticket count from Pete today.  We were doing actually really well.  Yeah, we're doing very well.  We're closing in on 10,000, I believe.  Well, I've got to tell you, I really support you.  What's the record for the comedy tour? 
[02:56:30]  We do, what, 11 in Philly?  I want to say Jersey.  No, Philly is not.  Yeah, 11 in Philly, in Camden.  Yeah, we're pushing, you know, we're up there.  I'm just really glad you guys are back.  I really was fucked up.  Thanks, Bob.  Hey, Bob.  I'm just glad you're back, and tomorrow night, we'll go crazy, and let's kill a girl or a  man.  Well, how much Coke do you need?  I'm taking orders right now.  I fill my entire head with it.  No, I can't do Coke anymore unless I'm snorting it off of an illegal hooker's aim. 
[02:57:00]  Who can?  Am I right?  Absolutely.  I'm really looking forward to it, really, really, so thank you, guys.  All right, Bob.  We'll see you tomorrow night, man.  Have a safe flight.  And plug Denver again.  We've got some listeners in Denver.  Yeah, Denver tonight at the Paramount Theater.  It should be a crazy fun thing, because I'm going to take out what's left of my dick.  All right, very good.  Five seconds.  Bye, sweetie.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Thank you.  All right, we'll take a break, I guess.  Yeah, I want to talk to Otto.  We haven't heard from Otto yet.  Yes.  Otto's going to speak next.  No one ever hears from Otto. 
[02:57:30]  We only hear from George.  He didn't bring George today.  Why?  George is home.  That's creepy.  I was working in Staten Island last night, a place called Illusions, and Adolf Hitler was  at the bar.  I said, what are you doing?  He goes, I'm going to kill six million Jews and five circus clowns.  I said, five circus clowns?  He goes, see, nobody cares about the Jews.  Hey, Otto.  Hey, Otto. 
[02:58:00]  Otto, is there any vampiro question?  Hold on.  I just want to hear boss trying to say ventriloquist again.  What is a ventriloquist?  A guy with a fucking talking fucking...  I stopped it.  I stopped it.  That was fucking shit out.  I stopped it.  I was going to say talking again.  I'm not good.  Can I ever tell you the greatest Jewish joke I've ever heard in my life?  Oh, I got one.  Told by Roger Rittenhouse with the hook on his hand.  Can we make this perfectly clear? 
[02:58:30]  It's a joke.  It's a joke.  It's a joke.  All of media is listening to us right now.  Great first day back.  You don't got to be shaking it up, you motherfuckers.  It's a joke.  I give Roger Rittenhouse the credit.  The dude with the hook on his hand.  I heard him years ago.  You're about to hear a joke.  This is a joke.  Should I not do it?  It's not an anti...  You didn't have to add it again.  You know what?  Again and again and again.  I don't want to be the Paul Michael McKeer.  Wait, wait, Patrice.  I won't do it.  Patrice, as a Jew, I'd like to hear it.  Yeah.  All right.  Good enough.  No, but you don't count Jews reject you because you're stupid. 
[02:59:00]  And you got tattooed.  You're a tattooed Jew.  Do not acknowledge that.  You've gone against part of their religion by getting your body marked up with tattoos.  So is every Jew that has plastic surgery.  Is Miss Wolfe Jewish?  I'm a Jew.  And so is Otto.  Otto is Jewish.  I've never had a problem.  The joke is funny.  Basically, it was when Schindler's List came out.  Oh, no.  When the movie came out.  Oh, that's got to be a scream.  No, no, wait a minute.  All right.  Let me get my finger back.  When Schindler's List came out, right?  The guy goes, he goes, hey, you know what?  Schindler's List is going to be a big movie because Steven Spielberg. 
[02:59:30]  I heard they're doing a deal with McDonald's that they're going to promote the movie.  He said, I can't wait to collect all six million cups.  That's pretty funny.  That's a great joke, man.  That's a great joke, man.  That's funny.  There's a cute joke.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Through the summer.  One day.  The summer.  I'd like to make it through Jones Beach. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  I would like to make it to noon today.  I think that was in the same tone as that.  Yeah.  One day.  I think you got to understand.  We're a bit nervous right now.  Why the fuck did we invite so many people into the studio today?  Why a bunch of comics?  I know.  It should have been.  Of all the people who never know what not to say.  It shouldn't even have been Jim.  It should have been me and Opie.  Yeah.  Opie and Andy.  Just like the website said.  Fucking cocksuckers.  I'm thinking just me with a few records.  That's it. 
[03:00:30]  Maybe I'll call in.  Opie's mid-morning attitude.  Hey, we got our first show.  The virus is now WSKO.  Yes.  All the time.  We got our first show.  The virus.  Yes, we do.  No.  Oh, no.  Come on.  The whole media is listening.  Let's let them hear your George Burns impression.  Shut up.  It's 1994.  Shut up.  It's a good setup.  We got an unofficial roast about to happen.  No.  I like that.  Oh, man.  I like it.  We'll decide.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  What are all these creepers?  Debbie, thank you. 
[03:01:00]  Debbie Wolf, everybody.  Thank you so much.  I didn't say the website, so let me say it real quick.  Before every message board yells at me, it will be peopleagainstcensorship.com.  Next week, we'll be back better than ever.  And we will promote that for you, too.  I have a new favorite fan site, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Which is?  It's me.  Go ahead.  I'm not going to promote it.  Okay.  Deb, can I get a good look?  What?  Good look.  A little turn around?  Turn around?  She's now a spokesperson.  She's the head of the news. 
[03:01:30]  Now, she's a pundit.  I'll be walking out in a second.  Yeah, you've got to get a Palpock if you want to see her ass later.  Nobody sees my ass on Palpock, Bobby.  Debbie never even showed her bra.  It would disgust me.  You'll see her in a towel, though.  She was very aggravating to watch when you first met her, because you'd see her, and  you'd watch her for like three hours, and she'd do nothing.  She wouldn't even slip with a skirt on.  No.  She would just sit like she was riding a horse side saddle.  Two-dimensional cock tease.  Sorry.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye, Debbie.  Thank you for having us.  All right.  Look.  There you go.  There you go. 
[03:02:00]  Lovely.  She's like us in a skirt.  Debbie's lovely.  She did a lot for us.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's got to be acknowledged.  And all the fans have been, man.  It's very appreciated.  All the ones that were involved with the sites that showed up.  You know what?  Because special interest groups that complain never have a counterbalance of people going,  wait a minute.  This is not wrong to say.  Leave these people alone.  And it was nice to have that.  To add to that, we don't trust any company at this point to stick up to special interest groups.  So what you've got to do is you've got to create your own special interest group.  Yeah.  And fight special interest group against themselves. 
[03:02:30]  Right.  Yeah.  And it's not a group against theirs, I should say.  It's not XM or CBS.  It's every company.  It's movie companies.  I don't trust anybody either.  Television people, none of them.  Yeah.  So your only hope is to have your own special interest group and fight the people trying  to get you in trouble.  Oh, yeah.  Cross the legs.  Cross the legs.  You can see a pattern when she crossed the legs.  A serious conversation about...  What?  You're having a serious conversation and Patrice is just trying to see her panties.  Patrice doesn't give a shit if we're here, if we're fired at.  Hey, he was on shows defending us with the donkey punching the fucking pirate. 
[03:03:00]  They call me a tap dancing nigger because I'm sitting there saving white guy trying to...  Oh, Lord, that old...  That old...  That massive...  Massive Ivers, he didn't do nothing wrong.  That beheaded hoes.  Why don't those little nigglets just get over it?  All right, so maybe you do care.  You guys are these fucking assholes.  Motherfuckers call me a sellout every five fucking minutes because only white people know  who I am.  Who's this nigga with a woman's name defending these patties? 
[03:03:30]  You had a dilemma, though, because you were getting some sweet TV time.  You really were.  Nigga, I took a real L. I took an L having a point.  I should have just went on there and gone, patriceoneal.com.  Yeah, plugs.  I was trying to be serious, but I was trying to make a point with these fucking goddamn  white guys.  And Sean Hannity, that motherfucker was like, good, thanks for John.  Because, you know, John stole me from Sean.  Oh, right, right.  Because he comes on like four hours early.  And John's like, get this dude in here.  I don't want to steal him just because... 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, well, that blew up in his fucking face.  Uh-huh.  When you said kick her in the shin and ejaculate in her eye, it was just...  I was watching going like, he didn't fucking just say that.  You can't say that on the radio.  You can't say that on fucking news.  He's like head of a woman's league.  Yeah.  With now women sitting right next to her.  Yeah.  Sitting right next to her.  He proved our point, though.  When you're just flying by the seat of your pants, shit happens.  Yeah, you're just talking.  And everybody in the studio is cracking the fuck up.  Girls, everybody. 
[03:04:30]  And he was laughing.  Because he knew.  And he's like, I'd like to apologize for what came out of his fucking mouth.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We got...  Wow, how many people are out there?  There's a lot.  There's a lot of people, man.  Looks like the fucking Hamas takeover.  See?  Make it topical.  Jones Beach tomorrow night.  That's what we want to really push today.  With all these guys and a few others that are not in studio today.  It's like the white side of a prison out there.  Wait, is that...  What? 
[03:05:00]  Where's the CBS News crew?  Uh, we told them to get lost.  Oh, because I was going to...  Get lost.  They were going to get a lovely little white man's ass.  Scram.  Oh, that would have been nice.  Yeah, I would have stood up and let him take a good peek.  Good morning.  Yeah, really.  Is that me?  Yeah?  All right.  Let's take a break.  Yeah.  Wait, but she's...  Who's that guy?  Just get us out of here.  This is an emergency broadcast.  The unpleasant noise you are about to hear coming from your radio is not a mistake. 
[03:05:30]  For me, Opie and Antony.  All right.  We're back.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Patrice O'Neal.  Jim Norton.  Oh, can I apologize?  Rich Voss.  Bob Kelly.  Otto.  From Otto and George.  Two, four, five out of the nine comedians that you'll see tomorrow night at Jones Beach.  Thank you, sweetheart.  Out there on Long Island. 
[03:06:00]  What?  I just want to apologize.  For what?  For almost getting us fired already?  I don't know if I say anything that offended anybody.  I just was repeating a joke that a guy said that I heard, and I was not in any way trying  to say anything fucked up, and I'm trying to be as contrite as possible, and I do apologize.  We're just a little nervous.  A little nervous.  It's been a weird three days.  I understand.  You know, you do understand.  But you know what, too?  But we got to be honest, fellas.  It's a lot of built up.  We're like the bear.  We're like...  You're right.  There's a lot of built up, just testosterone, radio testosterone, you know, that we'll be 
[03:06:30]  blurting out, you know?  Yeah.  And so, you know, we don't want to get anybody in trouble.  No, we want to have a good time.  I don't want to get no white men fired.  I want a George Burns impression.  Shut up.  I want to hear...  Oh, we got to hear it, dude.  Stop the bullshit.  I want to hear a George Burns impression.  I hate the idea...  This is an anniversary show.  Come on, man.  That everyone is here.  Why?  You're a little eager.  I love it.  It's sweet, Anthony.  Let me explain something.  Andy, let's hear it.  I was in construction for my entire working life. 
[03:07:00]  I just started getting into radio because I had done an O.J. Simpson song parody.  Opie played it on his show when he was doing radio at WBAB out on Long Island.  And the crowd, his audience, thought it was very good.  Opie invited me, my brother, to come down and perform it live.  When we did this, I...  That was in this disclaimer.  I used to...  Just give me the fucking impression.  I was drinking heavily.  Put a cigar in your mouth and just say it. 
[03:07:30]  I was...  Shut up.  I was drinking pretty good.  Come on, you great guy.  I was drinking pretty good to, you know, calm down a little bit.  And the fact is, I hadn't done a radio like that.  But I was so eager to be good and to...  I'm trying to explain myself.  Oh, you motherfucker.  Oh, this is not going to go well.  It's going to be fun.  I like it.  Shut up, Jimmy.  You motherfucker.  You're the worst.  When this fucking tape gets played every time, you are the worst. 
[03:08:00]  Why?  Because you sit there with this fake...  No, it was good.  It was really good.  I like to hear...  Can I be the judgment?  Can I just listen?  It's so bad.  I can't fucking...  I'm too happy.  Like, everything is...  Like, I'm too happy to be there.  And now it's embarrassing.  You know what's amazing about this whole thing?  I have a note here.  The last time we attempted to play this was in February.  And we got through, like, seven minutes.  And we have an hour.  Can you please?  It was so fucking hard. 
[03:08:30]  Put it in.  Just a little bit.  It is so hard for me to listen to.  Now, what happened was, my toilet broke that day.  Anthony doesn't like letting his guard down.  Oh, I hate this.  It was, like, 13, 14 years ago.  At least you have an excuse.  I was already doing radio for 10 years.  You two...  We...  You know what?  Motherfuckers know less about these two motherfuckers than you'll ever know.  Like, I know more about myself.  Yes.  Hey, we're not stupid.  Since I've been this radio, like, I'm sitting there going...  I was like, wow, I didn't know that about me on this motherfucking show. 
[03:09:00]  I told people I fucked the sink.  These spot seconds won't reveal anything.  Do the impression.  I brought up showering when my father made us all shower at the same time.  That was fucking embarrassing.  That was a trade-off to get the car keys.  What happened?  My father was teaching me and my brother how to shower.  You're afraid to wipe your ass and get some shit on us at 27?  He was teaching us when, I don't know, I guess I was about six or something, and my brother 
[03:09:30]  was probably seven, and he thought, you know, bath time was over.  But you're doing George Burns, so he stopped that.  No, I wasn't doing George Burns.  That's how it started.  He goes, hey, kid, smoke this cigar.  Try to say goodnight, Gracie.  Say goodnight, Daddy.  Goodnight, Daddy.  And I was petrified because he was standing under the water from the shower, and I was 
[03:10:00]  standing, me and my brother were standing on the back wall where there wasn't water, and  the water was running down his body.  And you know how when you shower, the water runs off the head?  It runs right off the head of your cock.  And I kept, he was like, come here, and I'll show you how to shampoo your hair and stuff.  And I'm like, no, you're going pee-pee.  Because it looked like he was taking a leak.  I thought he just made you and your brother take a leak.  He got in with you.  Oh, yeah, he was in the shower.  And to a kid, to a kid, because I'm like, you know, he's my dad.  His cock looked like it was like two feet long. 
[03:10:30]  Did he teach you how to sleep together, too?  No.  Daddy, what's that?  With a finger, and you know where that's going.  No, there was nothing sexual about it.  Wait a minute.  You just said water going down your father's body, down his cock, into your mouth.  What's not sexual about that, homo?  It wasn't sexual.  You had a homemade super soaker going right in your eyes.  Was there a lot of woo noises?  No.  Every time you go past a fountain, you get a hard on now. 
[03:11:00]  Did he teach you how to lie to a couch or two?  What are those little cupids with the water's coming off the dick?  Come on.  Oh, look at Atlas.  Look at Atlas in his face.  He doesn't throw change in it.  He throws his cell phone in it.  It's not sucking its cock.  Oh, look at his statue of Hercules.  It wasn't a sexual. 
[03:11:30]  He was teaching his son how to shower.  Oh, really?  They would say when they taught Ed Norton how to shower in American history.  When he was started, did he trade you to the Aryan Brotherhood?  No.  I didn't know that lifting up your left butt cheek was part of shower.  Daddy, is that a hard loofus thing?  Try it, kid.  No.  It was a father teaching his kids how to shower.  But I didn't want to go near him because the water was running off and it looked like he was taking a leak. 
[03:12:00]  What kind of rag is that, Daddy?  It had nothing to do with that.  Hold on.  That motherfucker just sexy to get more drugs from a fucking...  Oh, look at him sticking up.  Thank you, Will.  I'm trying to defend Andy.  Okay.  Andy, stop.  All right.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on, son.  Let me smack this soap on your ass, Jay. 
[03:12:30]  It wasn't like that.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  If anybody knows he's a queer, it'd be fucking Vaughn.  Thank you, Jimmy.  It wasn't anything like that.  You've lost Jimmy.  You've lost me and Antoine.  Why are you attacking me?  Let's go.  You brought it up.  You only defended him because of your skeleton.  Fucking bathtub experiences, okay?  Why am I attacking you?  I'm attacking you.  His brother almost drowned trying to give himself a blowjob in the bathtub. 
[03:13:00]  Trying to get the heat off of me, motherfucker.  Under the bus.  He had not thrown his brother under the bus.  His brother tried to blow himself in the shower?  In the bathtub.  That's the favorite story on the show.  And he was underwater.  His face was underwater, and he, like, had a snorkel in his mouth.  It was his dick, and his mother walked in.  Well, my mom walked in because she was knocking on the door, didn't hear anything, and she was  always paranoid that we were dying.  So she walks in, and he's under the water blowing himself.  He pops out of the water.  Like a Navy SEAL.  She ran down the hall, screaming for my dad, going, Freddy, Brett's gay! 
[03:13:30]  Is that what happened with you, Anthony?  Hold on.  And then Brett ran after her, soaking wet with a hard-on, going, Mom, I'm not gay because  I...  I was getting it.  I wasn't giving it.  Something like that, yeah.  I wanted to get one.  I didn't want to give one.  That's what happened with Anthony.  His dad caught him doing it, and he goes, Son, if you're going to practice, let me show  you a real one.  No.  There's nothing wrong with that.  There was nothing like that at all.  It was just this fear that he was urinating, and I wanted him to finish before he showed 
[03:14:00]  me how to shampoo my hair.  So where was he?  You and your brother, you're acting like you had a walk-in shower.  No, it was your basic Long Island tub and shower.  You couldn't be like nine feet away.  I was against the wall.  You were like an inch away.  They were playing Ring Around the Rosie.  And he was standing under the water facing the back wall of the shower, and we were against  the back wall facing him.  And the good thing about the shower, they can't see the tears coming out of your eyes.  He's killing you. 
[03:14:30]  I know, but because all I have to work with is the truth.  That's all I have.  Hey, this is...  Thank you.  Was it weird when you saw white shower water coming off of Daddy's penis?  Wow.  There wasn't any.  Stop it.  Daddy...  I don't want to drink this smoothie while I'm telling this story.  Daddy, they didn't even invent liquid soap yet.  It looked like conditioner.  What the hell?  Daddy, did you bring eggs into the shower? 
[03:15:00]  Bobby brings it right to food.  Right to food.  All right, see, we have enough material.  We don't have to play this.  No, no, no.  Put that shit on, dude.  You got to.  I want Vos to wipe his mustache off.  Did he dip you?  Did he dip you in one foot?  No, he didn't dip me.  I wouldn't even go near him.  Are you playing any games like duck, duck, fag?  I just...  Fag, you're it!  And you're always going to be it!  I just tried to... 
[03:15:30]  I stayed away, so it didn't work out.  The whole showering, learning thing didn't work out.  It ended with me crying because I didn't want to go...  Well, because I didn't want to go near him while I thought he was urinating.  Did he paint duck ears on it?  No, he didn't.  Oh, shit.  You are the worst.  It had nothing to do with it.  Oh, yes.  Tell that to child services.  I am better off with the George Burns audio.  Did he have a loofah sponge shank?  No, he didn't have a loofah. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  I know this much.  We'll never get past a minute.  I know.  That's okay.  I know.  Let's hear a little bit.  We don't want to see anybody.  You will now see me put my head down and not look at anyone until this is done.  Until the water gets turned off.  Shut up, boss.  I'm killing you.  At least it was my own dad and not a fucking crack dealer.  Oh, now there's hostility.  It's not my fault.  I didn't bring it up. 
[03:16:30]  I didn't even know the story.  At least they were taking a shower, boss.  Yeah.  At least it was clean.  Yeah, so they could wash the guilt off of each other.  The guy has to dress sexy to get more drugs from a drug dealer.  And you're killing my pal over here.  Little cute Anthony wasn't trying to get head up.  You know what, Opie really is annoyed.  I know.  He's getting...  Opie's trying to bring it back to your crackness.  How did he get the upper hand?  You know what?  One time in fucking five years, I finally...  Okay, I have a couple come back. 
[03:17:00]  I'm sorry that I've taken loads for five years from you fucking two jackasses.  All right?  I didn't even slobber until I started doing this fucking show.  Fuck you guys.  I talked right before I came here.  That's why boss is like he is, because his daddy wouldn't shout.  Boss would stand in the shower and go,  Boss had perfect diction before he started doing this show. 
[03:17:30]  Fucking boss used to have perfect diction.  I know.  You know, he's stubborn.  You know, it was never a problem.  Fucking Joey's taking everything I've built up throughout life out of me.  Holy shit.  Hey, you can hear this comedy tomorrow night at Jones Beach.  You guys are fucking brutal.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And then we got to sit now through this fucking audio of that first show.  Do you guys ever have a family reunion? 
[03:18:00]  Like a shower type thing?  No.  We're going to...  Never had a family reunion.  Rich, way to bring it up two days before Father's Day.  Yeah.  You know, my father's dead, thank you.  What, you want to, you know, freak to dig up his corpse and get him in a shower?  Oh, my God.  You know?  Him and his big, fat Italian cock are gone.  What did he...  Just right down the drain.  Dear old dad, right down the drain.  Oh, my God. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, my God.  I just remember it being like one of those big V8 cans.  So, when you're about...  You're already saying that.  He wants everyone to know he has a big cock.  When your mom started...  I bet you this fucking does, too.  Oh, you know he does.  When your mom started dating, you just say, we don't have to take a shower with him, too,  do we?  Yes, that was it.  Yeah, that's me and Sal.  Rowe, your son's in the shower with me, Rowe.  Got a nice cock, Rowe.  He misses his father. 
[03:19:00]  Rowe, I'm teaching him how to share.  You know what?  Come to think of it?  I think Anthony only does impressions of people with big dicks.  He does a great Milton Berle, too.  You know what?  I once made Nancy limp for a week.  Yes.  All right, well...  Did your treehouse have a shower in it?  All right, you know what?  I say we give it a couple of minutes.  I think he had all the showers removed from his house. 
[03:19:30]  This disc is an hour.  I guarantee we don't get past two minutes.  Two minutes at most.  Exactly.  I can't fucking listen to this.  It's actually not bad.  Shut the fuck up, Jimmy.  It's actually not.  You're lying.  No, I'm not.  You're a lying sack of shit.  My old stuff is humiliating.  Yours is just, while you were a construction guy, a little overeager.  It's not bad.  A little.  It's charming.  Play it.  I am giggling at everything.  I'm too loud.  It's so embarrassing.  You want to float a bun before we play it? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, please.  My problem is I'm...  I'm awful.  My problem is I'm still happy to do radio at this point.  You're not miserable yet?  It would be great.  Oh, your voice, too, is 18 octaves too high?  Yeah.  All right, well...  Let's go, baby.  I know we ain't making it up to...  I know we ain't making it up to boo-boo-boo.  Let's get it going.  We have to stick together on this one.  I know we do.  I'll help fight, man.  No problem.  I'll take these fuckers on.  Dude, it's over.  Two motherfuckers. 
[03:20:30]  It's over.  Dude, make me sick with your fucking top-secret horse shit.  Put that on you.  Two radio hacks when you were 13.  Going, whoo, making noises.  Get the fucking shit on.  It's going to be like the 300.  Let's remind everybody.  We're going to remind...  Look at his disclaimer.  Do they do that shit with anybody?  It's just like, glam.  I'm sitting there, boo-ba-ba-boo-boo.  This is from 1994.  Okay.  Right.  No one cares.  We care.  No one cares.  This is 18 years old. 
[03:21:00]  Bring your own sound effects Saturday.  All right.  Well, you can bring the crickets.  I got this one.  You motherfuckers.  Wow.  I can't believe it.  They all stalling their asses all playing this game.  They're playing this game.  We're 11, man.  Push this thing on.  I got to hear it.  Why don't we just be supportive?  And...  We promise.  All right.  You know what, Jimmy?  You're right.  Who's buying this shit? 
[03:21:30]  Jimmy, he's right.  Let's just enjoy it.  Enjoy it.  It's an older work, and it turned into...  Because, you know what, we might really like it.  Well, I like Anthony.  First of all, Anthony, honestly, God, out of all the people that do impressions, you're  one of the best.  Oh, thank you.  One second.  Wait till you hear George Burns.  Wait, when you start to...  Did you watch that show with Jeff Rose at all?  No, I didn't.  Hey, Bob, why didn't you do that show and show up as Brando in Apocalypse Now?  Hey, Anthony, when they start to tape, can you turn around like an impressionist and 
[03:22:00]  fix your hair?  And then I'll turn around and be George Burns.  Listen, Danny Gantz.  You know what?  He is one of the best impressionists ever.  He's brilliant.  These two guys, both of you, man, you can't be that bad.  I bet you it's good.  I bet it's good.  It is so bad.  One of the greatest radio acts ever in history, man.  I'll tell you this much.  Let's just enjoy it.  This was the demo tape that got us our...  There you go.  There you go.  Here's what's something.  It shows you how bad radio was back in 94.  Oh, God.  Who is deaf fucking listening to it?  All right, let's just enjoy it.  Let's enjoy it. 
[03:22:30]  I'm ready to listen to it.  I'm ready to listen to it.  I'm ready to listen to it first.  All right.  This is going to be fun.  All right.  What happened to my sunglasses?  Throw it in.  Oh, you can't...  See, you don't want to look.  What happened?  You won't be ashamed.  You don't want to look at anybody.  Fucking Kenny took him.  I got to hide my eyes.  You don't.  All right, here we go.  Oh, brother.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Christ.  Have fun.  I'm not going to look.  I'm going to cover...  Fans pointing out the buttons.  Who's heard this?  Jimmy's heard it a little bit.  Patrice has never heard it.  I wish it was worse.  Jimmy, shut up.  It is worse.  I think we were going to try to do it one day in here. 
[03:23:00]  We try to do it every, like, six months.  I listened to it.  I was in a car once listening to it, and then I had to pull over it.  You heard it?  I guess I heard it.  A little bit of it.  Yeah, a little bit of it.  Oh, shit.  You shut it off.  But it wasn't that bad.  No, it's so bad.  It wasn't that bad.  E-Rock, you want to make fun of us?  Sit down.  If E-Rock makes fun of me, I'll have to kill him.  Oh.  You don't even want to get into it because you know it's coming.  It's Opie back selling a song.  I was saying, we just want to... 
[03:23:30]  It's Opie the rock jock back selling a song, and he doesn't want...  I know exactly what you're feeling here.  It's radio.  Yeah, dude.  Was that Hart?  Was that Hart?  Who was that?  I think that was Soul of Siloam.  Oh, was it?  Oh, no.  You know, and I had to...  Oh, no.  This is so bad.  I had to make believe they were cool.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Oh, fuck.  This is awful.  How did we get in this shit?  Oh, no.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit. 
[03:24:00]  Long Island's best rock WBA base, Soul of Siloam.  Black Gold, Steve Miller, and the latest from...  They're already laughing.  Shit.  Look at him.  Look at him fucking balls.  That cocksucker.  Oh, my God.  Soul of Siloam.  Soul.  He pointed to somebody, too.  Soul of Siloam.  Wow, you're getting a standing ovation out there.  Holy shit.  It's fucking...  Here's why I've been laughing.  It's just weird to hear you backstalling a song. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, shut up.  It's true.  That's not bad.  No.  That was so bad.  Oh, my God.  I haven't been under the bus in a long time.  Oh, God.  There's a barrel on his hands.  You should drink that.  This is...  Oh.  I never thought I'd wish for another 30-day suspension.  I'd like one to start immediately.  I want to hear Anthony Charming.  Can you introduce Anthony?  Shut up.  I got dirt on all you motherfuckers, and I'll take it right to the bad part.  I agree.  Nice.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Black Gold, Steve Miller, and the latest from R.E.M. 
[03:25:00]  What's the Frequency, Kenneth, as you do the nighttime attic unit?  Go to your board.  Thanks for checking out the program tonight.  And we've got another fine show planned for you guys tonight.  Oh, no.  You should say fine.  Yeah, it's right.  Things were fine.  There's nothing left in this cup that he's drinking.  Opie is...  He's fucking eating his cup.  This is all my life.  Wait a minute.  I'm going to take a fake phone call.  You were saying you know it was an old show because you said the word planned.  You know he had like a brown bag with a sandwich that somebody prepared for him? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, you.  Oh, oh, oh, jeez.  Idiot.  That's a stupid bitch.  I was enjoying it.  I'm like, oh, my God.  You were actually kind of smooth.  Very smooth.  Don't make me bring up the glass dildos and we had a moment.  I already brought it up, nigga.  I want to...  We had a moment, though.  I was like, what are you doing?  I'm 30 years.  I've had a lot of problems that, you know what, that this show has helped me with and 
[03:26:00]  I love...  I fucking love this, man.  There's nothing that can be brought up, though, that is as bad as hearing old audio.  Like, I'm sure all you motherfuckers have shit from years ago that you're like, oh, God,  I can't even listen to it.  Here comes the...  Oh, stop it, Bobby.  Oh, you were fucking great forever.  I wasn't sucking my dad's cock.  I did not either.  That would have been more dignified than most of your material. 
[03:26:30]  We lost your mic.  That would be more noble.  We lost your mic.  That would be more noble than your marshmallow-y-o-y-o-s.  You're still my jokes.  You're talking about fucking sexual positions, you asshole.  It's cold out there, but warm in my belly.  I'm going to fucking re-break your leg.  It's all facts.  I know.  Let him eat each other. 
[03:27:00]  I know.  Bobby couldn't listen to a take from seven days ago.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  After ToyCast, he canceled HBO.  Oh, my joke.  Oh, my joke, man.  That's our only saving grace, Elvis.  And they can't be around each other without laying into each other.  We really are fucking penis.  Oh, you are.  We were actually eating the fucking cell.  We started friending each other. 
[03:27:30]  Hey, assholes, there's enough to go around.  Let's get back to Dick Sucker and high-pitched Henry.  Good focus, Bobo.  Thank you.  You guys got a rare opportunity.  Oh, my God.  Pretty mantis like eating each other.  God damn.  Checking out the program tonight.  And we got another fine show planned for you guys tonight.  We got my pals Joe and Anthony from Rotgut live in the studio.  Is there a black girl in the house?  You have a black co-host? 
[03:28:00]  You don't know who you are.  Do you have a black woman co-host?  Did somebody just go, mm-mm-mm?  Oh, shit, honey.  We got ourselves a show, baby.  What?  That was cool.  You agreed with him.  Why shouldn't you agree with him?  Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  I am going to fucking smack you.  And leave a handprint.  And leave a handprint.  I will leave a handprint.  Were you and Joe practicing in the car as you were driving there together?  Of course we were. 
[03:28:30]  Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Hey, leave Benicio del Toro hair alone.  Thank God we got Patrice in here today.  He doesn't know when to shut up, so we'll get about 45 seconds.  Oh, is this awful?  But this is classic high school shit, where when you're on it, you got to push it onto  somebody else's drive.  I'm focused.  Here we go.  I'm with you.  We're 32 seconds in.  How you doing, man?  Good, man.  Just in case people don't know who you are. 
[03:29:00]  Just in case?  The famous authors of Gun Electric Shock OJ, which you're going to do live on the show  tonight.  That's right.  And you're going to do other ditties.  Yeah, other wacky, kooky stuff, Ovi.  Who is that, the stranger that walked in the studio?  I have to leave.  Why?  I have to leave.  Who was that?  From both sides?  You had Casey Kempel already?  I had before?  On your resume, it says, I do ditties. 
[03:29:30]  No, he said he was going to do some wacky stuff, but he was trying to describe what  was happening.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Look.  Do you do Batman, too?  This is so fucking awful to listen to.  I can't fucking listen to this.  I know.  I'm going to have to leave.  It's good.  Can we listen to that black guy again?  You know he went healthy.  Can we listen to that sassy black chick one more time?  No.  There's no rewinding.  There's no rewinding. 
[03:30:00]  You don't like it now, but you know that right when you left the studio, you called your  girlfriend.  How was I?  Did it sound good?  Was it good?  Was it good?  Hey, Bob, it's right.  I want to hear some more.  Wait, but the intro should have been, you might recognize this guy if you had your heater  fixed last week.  Okay?  You might recognize this guy if you called the fucking Culligan man.  Okay?  If your bedroom is nice and cool and comfortable, you may recognize this guy.  Okay? 
[03:30:30]  Wow, Bob's a little angry.  Oh, fucking boss.  Boss is Mount St. Helens.  It's been fucking building up and building up.  He just spit out a filling.  What, did a Buick puff out of his mouth?  Oh, shit.  All right, man.  Well, there you guys go.  No, I want to hear a little bit more.  I don't want to miss wacky, kooky stuff before we're coming up.  They were titties.  They were titties.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Let me try to do it.  Some wacky kooky. 
[03:31:00]  It's second nature.  It's right there.  All right, let's go back to the tape.  That's 13 years old.  All right.  Right.  Oh, God, help me.  The better we gave Eddie Vedder the idea to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  What's your brother dressed as a transvestite?  Sitting on the dock.  Huh?  He sounded...  Yeah, you keep talking.  Oh, yeah.  Boss, keep chiming in, my friend.  All right.  I got no problems with Boss talking today.  You talk whatever you want.  Yes.  We only have to go to 11. 
[03:31:30]  You're sweating.  That's what someone just said.  You know, they heard Pearl Jam's version of Sitting on the Dock of the Bay, and they were  expecting to hear the OJ version.  Oh, this is...  He sounded like he was heavily sedated for you.  All right, I need a ruling.  I started a new video.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Someone needs a ruling.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  We can vote.  Oh, no.  We can vote.  Look at Jimmy.  What?  Jimmy's so enthusiastic about this whole thing, because you're a fucking cunt.  Jimmy, you suck.  Why?  I've never seen him enthusiastic to do a radio show before. 
[03:32:00]  I know.  I mean...  Oh, look.  We can vote.  Oh, boy.  I like voting.  Audience participation.  I like voting.  Oh, God.  It is so...  You know why?  Because we know it's coming, and it's just...  It's so fucking bad.  I think it's not that bad so far.  I don't mind it.  It's almost...  It's kind of entertaining.  I know it's not.  We're fucking with you because we think we have to, but this is actually...  No.  No.  Oh, stop it.  It actually is.  And then Patrice puts on his poker face.  Honestly, I...  He's fucking sitting on pocket aces. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, shit.  I got aces.  You guys had a connection right off the bat.  You could see it.  Shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  All right.  I need a ruling.  I started a new bit yesterday.  Celebrity death watch.  Right?  Yep.  All right.  You might have heard this last night.  Monday, Jessica Tandy, the old broad from Driving Miss Daisy, died.  Hey, I'll take that contract.  How old is she?  It's 85.  Oh, please.  Anyways, I don't know about you, but I've always been under the...  Celebrities die in threes, basically.  Always. 
[03:33:00]  Always, right?  So it's the celebrity death watch.  I guarantee two more prominent celebrities will die before October 1st.  So we're just waiting and watching.  George Burns in the hospital the other day.  It was a close call.  Very close call.  But he got out of it.  98 years old.  He has, like, his brain is swelling.  He pulled out.  And he pulled out of it.  I was like, darn.  I always wanted to see...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Did the SEC come after you?  Darn.  If you two were famous back then, you would have been two and three. 
[03:33:30]  No, it wouldn't be two and three.  It'd be two and three.  Three.  Three.  Willikers, Robert.  Gee.  Darn.  I...  The celebrities die in three.  I can't fucking deal.  Anthony is hiding behind the market.  I'm hiding.  I'm laughing at every little fucking thing.  It doesn't matter what...  Because you know why?  His...  He feels how much of an excited asshole he was just... 
[03:34:00]  I was so happy to be there.  Dude, this was my ticket out of construction.  And I thought if I did good...  He was in the fucking studio with his hands up.  Like he was on a roller coaster.  Yeah.  Woo!  That was so burned.  He was wheelchipped.  I thought...  He ran the Kinkos the next day and got a resume.  You know what?  One day.  Listening to you do early radio is like watching Voss act.  No disrespect. 
[03:34:30]  Okay.  I mean, just like, yeah, okay, yeah.  I'm so over-fucking-zealous.  I, like, wanted to be there.  I was happy to be there.  I was so excited that this could lead to me doing radio and not doing work anymore.  I didn't have to spin records anymore.  And listening to this, I wonder how it ever fucking happened.  But I can't fucking listen to it.  It is so painful.  You know what?  All right.  We get it, you stalling motherfucker.  I know.  Let's get back.  Fuck off.  You know what?  Why don't we play the rest of the tape on stage at Jones Beach tomorrow night? 
[03:35:00]  I would think we should probably play it out.  Wow.  But how come time is going so fucking slow?  But you can go, you can go, you can go, you can go over time here.  It doesn't matter.  No, there's new rules in place here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was out of it.  I was like, darn.  I always wanted to see George Burns singing, um.  No, I didn't.  That extreme song.  Oh, no.  If you don't like what you see here, get the funk out.  But he never does that.  Very good.  Maybe now after he's bopped on the head.  But I need a ruling.  I got an obituary. 
[03:35:30]  Patrick O'Neill, 66.  People are going, Patrick who?  Now, I said it has to be a prominent celebrity.  This guy was in Stepford Wives, 1975.  What do you think?  Don't look at me like that, Jimmy.  It's on the fence.  Is he prominent?  Let me see, Joe.  What do you think?  I rule me.  No.  No.  All right.  So it's still one with two celebrities to go, two weeks from now.  Two to go.  Two to go.  All right.  Well, we're going to debut real fast a song from Hot Gun.  Who the fuck was doing talk radio back then?  Like, just children?  Y'all are awful. 
[03:36:00]  This wasn't even the...  You should have been on three hours before y'all come on now, and y'all should be trashing you.  First of all...  Who are these two assholes?  And who's this George Burns happy motherfucker?  Why?  So you always wonder what it would be like if George Burns sang a song, and then damn it,  he did.  Shut up.  Turn that song off, you douchebag.  This is so awful.  Do it right now.  Jesus.  What? 
[03:36:30]  All right.  I don't know when the vocals start kicking.  If you don't like.  Did he want to do it again?  No, I don't.  I'm trying to take the heat off.  Hey, we were on in the middle of the night.  Huh?  We were on in the middle of the night.  Right.  And it wasn't...  What was the band with four?  Oh.  Motherfucker had to fly a pterodactyl to get that station.  Wait, wait.  Fly that four.  I was in.  I got it.  George Burns.  There it is.  This is horrible.  Stand on your roof with aluminum batting your ass away from an electrical storm. 
[03:37:00]  Face it to the left.  Broadcasting from Elm to Oak Street.  Wait, I think I got it.  Darn.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony on 72.8.  What?  72.8.  Well, we're going to take you real fast.  Anthony, do you have any plugs?  Yeah.  I'll be fixing Tom's air conditioning on Saturday.  I'll be signing at the appliance store.  I can't find this motherfucker.  I can't find this motherfucker. 
[03:37:30]  I can't find this fucking nice appliance.  Oh, boss is not.  He is slaying.  He's on fire.  That's right.  Yeah, you know.  This is all built up over the years and you can finally unload.  Someone said traveling virus back then.  You say there must be mold in the heating room.  I guess you're going to tell me to make my own egg sandwiches.  I just played a tape, motherfucker.  Well, we're going to debut real fast a song from Rotgut about the Cuban refugees. 
[03:38:00]  Right.  There was a Billy Joel made a tribute to the Bayman.  Right.  And we figured, you know, why not go to the other southern half of the states and make  a little tribute to the Cuban boat people.  Let's check it out on the Nighttime Attitude.  This doesn't play, right?  You guys don't get to hear that, really.  Or maybe part of it, I think.  It was classic.  Parodies were my forte. 
[03:38:30]  Parodies were my forte.  It was topical.  The whole audience is waving their arms, Sophie, outside.  I see lighters being lit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're burning this video down.  You'd like to make a donation. 
[03:39:00]  You should.  You should.  You should.  You should.  You should.  You should.  You should.  You should.  Now I'm there on a cheese enchilada.  This is why Christy Brinkley left Billy Dole.  Christy Brinkley left Billy. 
[03:39:30]  Just say the chick.  Yeah.  Say the blonde chick.  Christy.  Christy Brinkley.  Right after the song, he drove his car into a house.  That's right.  Oh.  Christy Brinkley.  Good recovery.  That was good, boss.  You were really needing a job, motherfucker.  You know, that I will never disagree with.  Dude, he was a fucking machine.  I needed everything.  I wanted a fucking job, motherfucker. 
[03:40:00]  You were like Al Josen, motherfucker.  When you were driving home, did you throw the clippers out the window?  I thought that was it.  I'm like, I'm in.  I got a gig.  We're done.  We're done.  That's good.  We have a few minutes.  We have a few minutes.  Did you ever do, like, a...  Is of cashing offers, a welfare check.  Yeah, of course.  It's a pattern.  All right.  Is it going to go on all day?  Yes.  We're just embarrassed by El Presidente's fear. 
[03:40:30]  That hairy maddeness, you know he must have lice.  My mother's beard's long, but at least she keeps it nice.  Now I'm still on a half-eaten pizza.  It's not much, but it's all that I've got.  How I wish I was Ricky Ricardo. 
[03:41:00]  Cause his drum would seem just like a yacht.  Baba Lou.  Oh, yeah.  This is so touching.  I feel like I'm in a shower at your house.  As much as I'll tease you, and I might even be sarcastic.  A guy who does fucking heating.  I'm sorry.  What did you say?  I said it's so touching.  I feel like I'm in a shower at his house.  I'm sorry.  Can you play the part where you go, 
[03:41:30]  Well, that was fantastic.  It's coming up.  It's coming up.  Is it a Baba Lou?  That was a great fucking thing you just said.  See, it was, you know, the Cuban boat people.  So Baba Lou.  Baba Lou.  Yeah.  That's the least offensive.  Why?  He wasn't a comic, though.  It was a fucking...  Oh, thanks.  He wasn't a singer, either.  I gotta be accurate.  He was an air-conditioning guy.  I did a song parody.  That's the most forgivable thing on this god-awfulness.  Let me ask you a question.  While you were doing that,  Bobby was practicing fucking chairs on stage. 
[03:42:00]  Let me ask you a question.  Now, let that sit.  You get greedy, you ass.  You just had an applause break.  They really don't even like you,  but now you got him on your side,  and that's why they hate you again.  You're a slurring asshole.  Let me ask you a question.  Did you give him any, like...  Did you coach him in radio in any way?  Fuck no.  Well, I taught him by watching.  I taught him all the bullshit stuff that happened, I guess.  Yeah, but...  But apparently, back then, this was good.  I don't know why. 
[03:42:30]  I have no idea why.  What were they doing in radio in 94?  Well, that's it.  I want to hear the end of the Bible,  because that song's over.  That song's done.  Like, that tape went out,  and they loved it.  In Boston.  I didn't know about editing songs either.  I gotta love that.  Rotgut on the Nighttime Attitude.  And on the eighth day... 
[03:43:00]  St. John's.  You really were a fucking serious dude  trying to not fix it no more.  In the background, you heard a faint...  Yes, it was the Ricky Ricardo laugh.  It was a faint mixing...  It's just so ridiculous.  And he added his own echo,  because he couldn't afford an echo machine.  I just...  I recorded it in a duct.  Hey, uh... 
[03:43:30]  Is Kenny still around?  I gotta change shirts.  Yeah, I was getting a little wet.  Holy shit.  Well, the song's over.  It must be time for Ope to intro a song or something.  This shit's been on much too much on me.  Push that button, fucker.  Let's go, baby.  Live in St. John Community in 1870.  Long Island's best rock, WBAB.  Oh, we're live. 
[03:44:00]  102.3 WBAB.  Oh, Long Island.  It's Opey and the Nighttime Attitude.  Squeeze, of course, and Tempted.  Sending that out to Sally in Levittown,  faithful listener of the program.  Yeah, my choice.  Oh, you missed it.  You should have said the listener of the program.  Fuckin' fuck!  Fuck you!  The boss is on fire!  I think you're good. 
[03:44:30]  They like that.  God damn!  Sally calling in again today.  Sally's request for the day is...  I hope you're enjoying your last...  Your last time on the show.  Oh, why are you bringing Sally in?  Oh, my fucking fault!  Well, I hope Sally can do the Starbucks tour.  Hey, Sally, what's going on tonight?  Nothing.  That was Sally calling in. 
[03:45:00]  What are you guys doing?  Nothing, Sally!  What are you doing?  Can I hear some screams?  I love screams!  He turned.  He turned.  Yeah.  My choice, Ope.  I'm out of my mind tonight  because I got Joe and Anthony from Rotgut,  and these guys are...  They're all yes.  You guys are mental.  That's right.  But thanks for stopping on by.  I appreciate it.  No fun.  Any time.  The mediocre...  Wait a minute.  They're not mediocre at best. 
[03:45:30]  He's crazy.  He doesn't agree with anything.  Whoa.  Oh, it's Gabe Kaplan coming.  Watch out.  He's a fucking loser.  I'm out of my mind.  Whoa.  Sally's on the show.  Here comes Henry Ford.  He got a head.  I mean, what's that?  I never thought it could be this bad.  Henry Fonda.  Watch out.  Henry Fonda's on the show.  Whoa.  You fucking maniac.  You're a doodly, crazy, dandy doodly doodly. 
[03:46:00]  I never fucking thought it could be this bad.  I knew it was going to be this bad when this day came.  You are mental.  This is so bad.  We got a crazy, mental, nutty show tonight.  George Burns is going to stop by.  George Burns is singing extreme songs.  Hey, Sally.  Hi, Sally.  Hey, Sally.  What's going on?  Hold on.  I got another car.  You guys still there?  Yes, we're still here, Sally.  I got to call you back.  All right, Sally. 
[03:46:30]  Too much energy in the room for me tonight.  Oh, shit.  The phone line is lit up.  Fucking Sally.  Oh, my God.  This should have fucking been erased.  I am soaked.  Isn't it really hot?  Oh, it is so fucking hot.  Get to Thorzine.  He's mental.  Where's the howl doll? 
[03:47:00]  Watch out, baby.  Let's get back to the men.  You know what that was?  Hey, you know what that car crash was?  It was a car crash really happening outside.  Well, this show stinks.  What's going on outside?  Someone's dying.  Holy shit, Sally.  Jesus, Sally, are you okay?  I'm all right.  Oh, you're all right.  This is Opie.  Are you all right, Sally? 
[03:47:30]  I'm okay.  Nothing happened.  As I just chuckle and laugh through the whole thing.  Can you imagine if George Burns was driving that car?  Hey, look out.  In your bio, did you say mental?  I was called mental back in the day.  And then before he got the job, that's what he did when he was going to pick air conditions  and he uses those phrases now?  Hey, man.  Your Freon is working. 
[03:48:00]  Your shit's going to work.  This fucking mental.  It's going to be so fucking crazily cold in here, dude.  Coming out of here.  Well, I think I would love to get back a little bit more.  We're almost out of time.  A couple of minutes.  Five minutes.  A couple of minutes.  Let's get mental, dude.  Push it.  We're glad to do it.  Pizza de Lusso, Comac.  Oh, jeez.  That would be Cliff, Joe, and Greg.  All we have to do is say it ten times and we get a free pizza.  Are you serious?  They deliver it.  They're going to deliver it right here. 
[03:48:30]  All right.  Do it real fast.  Go.  That would be pizza de Lusso, pizza de Lusso, pizza de Lusso, pizza de Lusso, pizza de Lusso.  That's five, six.  Pizza de Lusso, seven.  I said it, too.  Pizza de Lusso.  Oh, so that's ten.  We're up to twelve.  That's a point and a half.  All right.  So you did have plugs.  So you did have plugs that day.  Yeah.  And now he reads them like, oh, boy.  All right.  Well, let's get to it.  Yeah, Vegas.  Oh, shit.  This motherfucker had a pocket full of taps that he just banged around in shoes.  And they wear out every show.  Stop. 
[03:49:00]  He had a pocket full of sand.  Put on the console.  With some soft shoe.  Hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey.  You don't look lovely, Nick Shirley.  Over-eager fucking whore.  Pull in springs.  Pull in springs.  Pull in springs.  Let's get a listener in love there.  Hi, Sally's calling.  Sally's calling.  Pat, what's up?  Hey, I love you.  Love you.  Love the show.  And my mouth just went retarded.  Perfect.  I was wondering if you guys ever realized the excitement in Opie's voice sounds really, 
[03:49:30]  really close to the Susan Waldman excitement.  Oh, my God.  George Burns is singing extreme.  Goodness gracious.  And then, this is pretty interesting from Jeremy in Jersey.  Jeremy.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Opie.  How do you like Point Left Friday now?  Fuck you, Jeremy.  Point Left Friday.  It stinks. 
[03:50:00]  It stinks.  I hate it.  It's not fun being on this side.  Oh, there we go.  Nine and a half.  All right.  Joe, Cliff, Cliff, get in your van and start down here.  I want one with everything on it.  Great.  Thank you.  My boss is going to love that one.  That was about $1,000 worth of advertisement.  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  It's on your show.  All right.  Hey, we have Sam Houston in the studio tonight.  Let's give away $1.30 worth of advertisement.  I know.  Those fuckers are laughing too hard out there.  Oh, shit. 
[03:50:30]  Our fifth caller, Sally.  Sally, your caller's one through six.  Oh, God.  And now for a free...  Sally, you're only the third caller.  All right.  I'll call back in about three minutes.  I'll be the fifth.  Oh, fuck.  Wait.  I think we have Sal Lee on the phone again.  Fucker, boss.  The beauty of boss is I'll get to call after the show.  You know, I'm just kidding. 
[03:51:00]  You're not mad, are you?  You're not mad right there, are you?  I'm going to tear down some walls right now.  Hey, I figured I'd join in because the wrestling guys are going to match a  pretty hard.  But you guys are good now.  See, Jimmy knows.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Oh, this fucking worm.  He'll be on the phone before he fucking pulls out of the parking garage.  Shut up, nervous.  And I'll get the same call.  He's not mad.  And I'll check on the radio and hopefully hear some rock gut. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, fuck you.  Stupid boss is going to sell CDs after this.  I'm fucking scared for you to do that.  You cannot bring in what he's going to fucking do after he's done.  No, really.  Jesus.  He's going to start with me first because he thinks we're both in the same trouble.  And I'm like, I'm going to be like, oh, I'm in trouble all of a sudden.  He's going to, Lord Jesus, we were joking.  Then he's going to go up to the show. 
[03:52:00]  Fan, you think he's going to take me off the tour?  Was it bad that I sold my DVDs?  I mean, they wanted them.  They were asking.  You.  You're not supposed to go make it.  That is the reason you're going to juggle the main.  That was the right move, though.  I'm going to trick it to you.  You got us your fleck, man.  That's what that thing is going to do, you fucking puppy.  This is bad. 
[03:52:30]  We're going to tap out.  We're going to tap out.  Listen to who's talking.  The guy that gets bombs and fires on the road, he does damage control before he gets home.  You know what happened to me in Ohio?  How the fuck would I know what happened to you in Ohio?  I don't call them and say, listen, as I'm getting fired right now, did I do wrong?  How did this turn on me?  We got a good tape going.  You fucking.  That's why.  I knew he was going to do it.  Just in case anyone's wondering out there, this is the brilliance of me.  Thank you.  I just came in the last minute. 
[03:53:00]  That's why I got so mad at me doing it, because you've got to talk about what a fucking little worm you are.  Fucking pussy.  Erase his number so you can't call an apology.  All right, let's, uh, sorry.  Oh, man.  That was so fucking wrong.  No, he'll walk to the elevator and we'll know, that was fun, right?  Oh, look. 
[03:53:30]  All right.  All right.  Fucking slave-eye motherfucker.  Just say your jokes and fuck.  I knew that.  That was fucking wrong.  I got him under control, though.  I got him under control now.  Nigga, that's me.  This is legitimately fucking angry with this fucking douchebag.  Nigga, I've been doing this for fucking years before comedy.  That was DEFCON 12.  That was Mushroom Cloud.  He said, this is going to stop right now.  He's going to follow me later, apologizing. 
[03:54:00]  And then what that does is scare us into thinking any, like, little pussy-ass shit that we all do.  Like, hey, Ope, you know.  Am I still going to be on the radio?  Now we got to slow down.  Because now Ope can look at you fucking cause of you.  Ope can give the eye like, uh.  There's a lot of shit that you did, too, there, Patricio, buddy. 
[03:54:30]  All right, here we go.  He's had some heart-to-heart, so let me...  Now fucking lost, man.  Now that we calmed you fuckers down.  The speeding frenzy.  You better keep it going, too, you punk motherfucker.  Play that horse shit from 1994.  Oh, I hope I'm as good as Dennis Wolfberg.  You play that fucking...  Hey, you really haven't come very far.  Fifteen years ago, it was rot gut, now it's fat gut.  Oh, shit. 
[03:55:00]  Point left, right, eh?  Feel free to point to Patrice.  He's pointing.  Why is Bobby pointing?  If I had two heads, I would have been looking at you, too.  He's fatter than me, that's why I'm pointing.  He's not so taller than you.  If you put the relative size, you're 4'8", first of all, 6'4", we're reversed.  You're 6'6".  First of all, first of all, fryer hack.  Never been in shape and always been A-shape.  I had abs at one point. 
[03:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  Now you are an abs.  It's called a fetus.  Wait, now you are an abs.  You're absolutely fat.  You're an absolute mess.  You're an absolute man.  You're an abnormal.  Abundant.  You know, Vos can't come up with them fucking idiot kids.  Let's make something with AP. 
[03:56:00]  Adaption.  What?  Oh, fuck.  Norton lost a little weight and all of a sudden he's a fucking exercise expert.  He still has a little fat stomach, too, and I don't like it.  Wow, you're opening your seltzer.  It's exploding all over your face.  Reminds you of those showers?  Everybody drinks seltzer.  Obi, why do you shake it so hard?  And who opens it right next to their eyes? 
[03:56:30]  Why do you have soap and drink seltzer at the same time?  Are you leaning over?  Or is that how you're shaped?  Bobby's shaped like a lean.  He's shaped like a...  In a parenthesis.  No one even knows.  It's not like a fucking...  A parenthesis.  You are such a shithead.  It's a parenthesis.  You fucking idiot.  Don't try punctuation jokes. 
[03:57:00]  Absolutely.  Keep going, boys.  Keep going, boys.  They're eating each other.  I love it.  Fighting out of the carcass and they forget about the carcass.  He's so boring.  What did you do?  You've got a carcass in front of you.  You're out there getting each other's legs.  Carcass.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I guess we've done it.  Let's hear a little bit.  I said a couple more minutes just to give you the XM or something.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Hey, we have Sam Kinison in the studio tonight, too. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  I agree.  How big are you guys?  Wow, look.  It's five after.  Sam Kinison?  That's amazing.  How'd you get him in the studio?  Absolutely.  And how did you get his body?  I know.  It wasn't that good.  It wasn't that good.  All right, well.  I want to hear Kinison.  If Kinison was in the studio.  We're going to have to hide again.  All right.  Why?  Not us.  We're going to have to hide again because it's awful.  Because, first of all.  Sam's in the studio. 
[03:58:00]  Let me tell you another thing.  I have another thing I have to preface.  I had been out at a gig the night before, so I was singing, and my voice was shot.  So I couldn't really do a good impression.  You didn't have to.  He was in the studio.  You had another person come in.  The heat's off you.  I did a much better Kinison impression on Howard's show.  Oh, hey.  This is fun.  I think you can still see it's fun.  Oh, my God.  I don't want it.  Yeah.  Painful.  Unless you can shut the sun off.  Your embarrassment isn't going away.  All right.  Unless you can shut the sun off. 
[03:58:30]  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Hey, we have Sam Kinison in the studio tonight, too.  Hey, old man.  How you doing, bud?  Pretty good.  Yeah, we're hanging out with the guys tonight, having a good time.  From Rodgut?  Yeah, I'm hoping that pizza comes down.  I'm losing a little weight being dead.  I got nothing.  Hey, Sam, what do you think of O.J. Simpson?  Oh, guilty as sin.  I was talking to Nicole and her waiter friend.  Yeah, she said he came up, looked pretty angry, stuck a knife in her. 
[03:59:00]  You know, the whole deal.  Okay.  Very good.  Wait.  I think it's time to do...  Jesus Christ.  Oh, oh.  Oh, you suck.  That was so incredibly bad.  What?  That was just...  That I can't even come out.  Oh, you made me sick.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, how you get a job at that?  Oh.  Oh, my voice was shot.  That was a great one.  Like who, Bud Dwyer? 
[03:59:30]  That was a good impression of Fred Kinison.  That was his cousin.  That was awful.  Oh, this is a nice lot of housing.  I can't come out.  I can't come out yet.  Why?  I had to stay behind that.  Oh, man.  Come on, Sam.  Who's that bad?  Come on, Sam.  You took the...  Holy...  You took the gas out of Greg after that one.  Oh, oh, oh.  I understand.  I couldn't do that part because my voice was very...  You could hear it. 
[04:00:00]  When I'm talking, it's cracking a lot.  I'll do it for you.  Oh, can I get a job?  Oh, I'll be.  I need a job.  Oh.  All right.  Here we go.  A little more.  Here we go.  Here we go.
