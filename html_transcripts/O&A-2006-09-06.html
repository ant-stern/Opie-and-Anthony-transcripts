<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-topic with characteristically crude and offensive humor.  The show began with a discussion of "Whip Em Out Wednesday," a segment encouraging listeners to display "WOW" signs to elicit reactions from women, punctuated by vulgar banter between Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  They promoted their upcoming "Traveling Virus" comedy show in Philadelphia, referencing a WISP radio broadcast and a promotional video.  Celebrity gossip dominated a segment, focusing on a purportedly leaked photo of Lindsay Lohan, a picture of Suri Cruise, and commentary on Katie Couric's coverage, interspersed with jokes about Steve Irwin's death and criticism of news personalities like Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer.  They also briefly mentioned a story about a couple with Down syndrome getting married.

A guest, Sam, celebrated his birthday on air.  The hosts discussed their YouTube presence, highlighting user-uploaded videos and the platform's chaotic nature. Norton discussed his new American Express card and a humorous live TV commercial anecdote.  Extensive criticism of ABC, contrasted with praise for CBS and Katie Couric, peppered the broadcast.  Profanity, sexual innuendo, and offensive jokes were prevalent throughout this portion.

The next segment focused on Jessica Simpson's allegedly lip-synced *Today Show* performance due to a burst blood vessel in her vocal cord, including a playback of her raspy vocals and her interview.  This transitioned into a comedic analysis of overly dramatic news teases, playing several examples and discussing their absurdity. A caller mistakenly referred to Steve Irwin as "Crocodile Dundee," leading to further jokes.  A listener recounted a long bus trip, prompting discussion of a potential segment sending a crew member on a cross-country Greyhound journey.  A listener praised the show, a video contest was promoted (with a Macbook prize), and an E-Rock story about a noisy child on a plane was shared and imitated.

A listener then recounted an unpleasant plane experience with a noisy child, whose father claimed had Down syndrome, triggering a discussion about a pre-recorded segment featuring a couple with Down syndrome getting married.  Clips from the news report highlighted their wedding and lives, including interviews with the bride, Carrie, and groom, Sujit.  A caller, Mike, angrily reacted to the jokes about the couple, threatening violence and eventually hanging up in distress. The hosts continued with their jokes, further antagonizing Mike.  Another caller, Ken, shared his experience with a child with Down syndrome, stating that while the jokes were offensive, he could still find humor in difficult situations.  The segment returned to clips of the wedding, including the groom's nickname for his bride, "Care Bear," and their decision not to have children.

Listener calls, tangents about an intern (Jason) who worked in prosthetics, a contest idea, and a listener's XM radio collection filled the following segment.  They also reminisced about their David Letterman appearance and an XM radio promotion involving "Pink Innos."  More jokes, listener calls, and the hosts' usual banter, including discussions of their controversial humor and "Whip-A-Mount Wednesday," concluded this section.

The show began a new segment by briefly mentioning FCC inquiries and approved radio IDs. They then promoted a pink Eno benefiting the Susan G. Komen Foundation, discussing donation amounts.  A possible Oprah appearance was discussed, acknowledging the show's controversial nature (mentioning Ludacris and Snoop Dogg, with a picture of Snoop Dogg from an XM tie-in being mentioned).  A listener's unsolicited credit card offer led to a discussion of a video of a youth football assistant coach tackling a player, sparking debate (with highly offensive language) on parental behavior at children's sporting events. A caller provided context about the tackled child's previous late hit.

The latter part featured a trivia segment on "famous firsts" in music (first rock CDs, first MTV video, first SNL musical guest, first #1 rap song), involving much speculation and incorrect answers.  They discussed the first rock star to date Winona Ryder and the first recorded rap song, leading to a lengthy discussion (with excerpts) of Blowfly's "Rap Dirty" (1965), which contained highly offensive and racist language.  The show concluded with a segment featuring Norm Crosby's Jerry Lewis Telethon performance.

The final segment opened with a listener praising the show and recommending a 70-year-old MySpace user ("Slash Anthony Cumia").  A listener-submitted audio clip of a child screaming on a slingshot ride, accompanied by the mother's laughter, was played and heavily criticized.  The clip was mentioned as being available on OpieandAnthony.com.  A screaming contest followed, with attempts by the hosts and a caller.  Master Poe from a martial arts studio promoted his business.  Discussion then shifted to a YouTube video of Norton's exposed buttocks, an upcoming photoshoot, and disagreements over wearing sweaters.  An internâ€™s burned CD and another intern's pants with a naked lady and two tigers were discussed.  A caller thanked them for removing a YouTube video.  The show ended with discussion of the photoshoot, a curtain call video (including Voss bragging about sex with Bonnie), Steve's new haircut (with a comedic bit about his parents dying), and the hosts arguing over items before leaving for the photoshoot.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up!  Alright, here we go. 
[00:00:30]  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's.  On the road.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome.  To Whip Em Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  That's right.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  It's very easy.  Get yourself a wow bumper sticker.  If the station you're listening to us on is too lazy to get the wow bumper stickers  to you, then make a homemade wow sign.  Throw it on the back of your ride.  Drive around town and there are women out there that will flash you.  Yeah.  That is the concept of Whip Em Out Wednesday. 
[00:02:00]  It's very easy.  It's so simple.  So.  What happened?  Where's the music?  What happened?  What happened?  I don't know how to talk about my music.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  I don't know what to do without my music.  He's panicking.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  What did you do?  So make sure you get your bumper stickers and your homemade wow signs on your car. 
[00:02:30]  He doesn't know what to do.  It's like the anchor people when that teleprompter goes out.  One of my favorite skits of all time on SNL, where they show the morning news people and  what happens when the teleprompter or whatever it's called, teleprompter.  The teleprompter.  The teleprompter shuts off and then they just sit there and like, try to chit chat and fall  into a void.  One of the only times Tim Meadows was funny on that show. 
[00:03:00]  Who?  Was he on that show?  I think he was in that skit, I do believe.  Yeah.  His movie career is still well.  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  He was up in 10 years, right?  He's been out there for a long time.  Yeah.  He was there forever, yeah.  Like one of the longest running characters.  Cast members.  All right.  Anyway, yes.  Hey.  It is Whip Em Out Wednesday.  We'll have more on that as the show goes on, okay?  But it's very basic.  There are women out there that will flash you.  They're just looking for that wow on the back of your car. 
[00:03:30]  That's all they need.  It works.  They can't believe it sometimes.  Like I said, the improv, and there's a girl who stood up and just wowed the crowd.  And then she turned around and wowed the other way.  And other comedians who aren't familiar with the show can't believe that chicks do this  in comedy shows.  Oh, yeah.  Lovely.  It works at all our events.  I mean, when we're down there in Philly, you're going to see wows all over the damn place  when we do the O&A traveling virus at the Tweeter Center in Camden.  We're taking over Philly starting this Friday.  Oh, did you hear the promo they're running? 
[00:04:00]  Promo?  Why?  We're going to be broadcasting live from WISP in Philly this Friday.  And they're encouraging all the fans and the O&A pass to show up at WISP.  Hopefully breakfast for everyone.  I don't know, though.  I don't know what they got planned for everybody, but they're encouraging everyone to join us  for our live broadcast outside WISP.  And this is the promo they're running.  Since the beginning of time, mankind has battled nature in an effort to survive.  As a species, we have overcome smallpox, the Black Death, influenza, SARS, the bird flu, 
[00:04:30]  acute nasopharyngitis.  Now, in 2006, we've been subject to the most dangerous, fastest-spreading virus on the planet,  and it's heading straight for our studios.  No.  Prepare yourselves for the Opie and Anthony Show.  Broadcasting live from the free FM 94.1 WISP studios next Friday morning.  What's up, Philly?  It's Anthony.  Hey, what's up, Philly?  It's Opie from the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:05:00]  The first 100 ladies brave enough to face the virus in person  will also catch tickets to the traveling virus at the Tweeter Center on September 9th.  Brought to you by C&C Ford in Horsham and Chapman Ford in Philadelphia,  where you can get 0% financing for so many months for the Opie and Anthony Show.  New Horses!  Free FM 94.1 WISP.  How do you sneak a commercial into our dramatic return to Philly?  Gotta.  I was listening to that last night.  I'm like, wow, that's some really, really good production. 
[00:05:30]  And then in the middle of it, it turns into a commercial.  Gotta sell it.  Gotta sell it, right?  All right, Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006.  Yes, this Saturday, Tweeter Center, Camden, New Jersey.  Tickets on sale now through all Ticketmaster locations.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  So there you go.  That's what Philly's doing today.  And we got Jimmy Schubert, I think, coming in Friday.  Yeah.  Who's doing the Traveling Virus show.  Who I haven't seen in a while.  Arara.  I'm really psyched to see Arara, man. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, we got 10 comedians.  It's going to be just amazing.  We're going to be taking over Philly.  We're broadcasting live.  There's all sorts of activities planned for everybody.  We got to go to the cheesesteak place, too, man.  The guy who, uh, English only.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's right.  How's that working out for him still?  Actually, can we get him as a guest?  We're looking for Philly guests.  Someone write that down and try to get him on the show.  That would be nice.  Yeah.  That would be really, really cool.  By the way, I'm distracted because on one of my computers, I get to see what E-Rock's doing. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, no.  You do?  While we're doing all the heavy lifting here and trying to do a radio show for the entire world.  Where do you see that?  For the entire world.  Oh, no.  Oh, you see, like, you could see what he's browsing.  Yeah.  Okay, what is he browsing?  Well.  Wrestling site?  Play Scouts again?  No, thank you.  There it is.  Lindsay Lohan and her who?  Ah!  Yeah, I saw this last night.  I am calling shenanigans.  You don't think that's real?  Yeah, I think it's fake.  It's droopy.  Because there's another one. 
[00:07:00]  It's droopy.  There's another one of, what's her face there?  From, uh...  Ooh-ha!  With Paris Hilton.  Yeah.  That stupid show.  Nicole Richie.  Yeah, Nicole Richie.  Ugh, can't remember her awful name.  Yeah, there's one of Nicole Richie walking on the beach, and she is worse than a concentration  camp victim.  Right.  Literally.  Like, she's walking and just nothing but skin and bones.  And, uh, I think that's fake, too. 
[00:07:30]  Is that...  That looks...  Something looks fake about the up-the-skirt one.  Yeah, something just looks fake.  It looks like it was a panty shot, and they turned it into graphic, like, uh, without panty  shot.  Um, the way the skirt's coming up, I understand that can happen, but it just doesn't look right.  It looks too crisp and clear.  The light of the skirt doesn't look naturally...  It looks photoshopped.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Iraq, where's this, uh, photo from?  Um, a website called What Would Tyler Durin Do? 
[00:08:00]  It's a celebrity site.  Yeah.  It's been making the rounds on a few sites.  What, this, uh, particular shot?  Yeah, this shot.  Of her poo-ha!  What, is she getting off a boat or something?  Yep.  And her dress is, uh, is up a bit getting blown.  Blowing up in the breeze.  Uh, her dress is getting blown, and, uh, there you get to see, uh, what she's, uh, sporting.  Yeah, that looks photoshopped.  It's a bit on the...  The authentic picture will turn up.  There's a, there's a bit of a droop. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, so you're gonna call shenanigans on this?  Yeah, I'm calling shenanigans.  Really?  I'm gonna say it's real.  How much you wanna bet?  Um, I don't know.  Uh, three mil.  Hmm, three mil.  Let me look at my bank account.  I bet a buck.  I bet a buck.  Well, I was distracted by that, so...  Yeah.  If it is real, it's, uh, I don't know.  It's not the most attractive thing.  That's for sure.  Uh, no, no, it's a little, um, like gravity has taken, taken a hold of it. 
[00:09:00]  It's, uh...  Pulled it down.  Looks like the Rocky Horror movie poster.  But turned on its side.  Stupid, droopy mess.  All right, well, I was looking at that, and I was also looking at the picture of, uh, Surrey.  The Surrey Watch is over, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank goodness.  It's in our paper here in New York, uh, New York Daily News, page two.  It's the cover of Vanity Fair, which is coming out, I guess, Tuesday or something like that, or sometime next week. 
[00:09:30]  Uh, yes, Surrey, she's our baby.  And there's the picture of, uh, Tom and Katie, uh, lovingly looking at, uh, their baby, Surrey, who's now an adult, it looks like.  Looks like Katie, yeah.  I mean, how old is this kid?  Big head of hair, needs his fifth haircut already.  It looks like the kid from Rocky.  Remember the head of hair, Rocky II?  With him and Adrian had the kid.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stupid black head, like a Lego person.  Can you put that back, Hawks?  Yeah, Anthony pointed out, uh, this morning there, definitely looks like Katie. 
[00:10:00]  Definitely looks like Katie has those Katie eyes.  And look, the nose, the mouth, the whole deal.  And the more I look at it, the more I look at it, it does, uh, have a resemblance to Tom Cruise.  No.  I don't see it.  I don't see any Tom Cruise in there.  The kid looks Asian.  The kid looks Asian?  The kid looks like it has a wig on to look more like Tom Cruise.  But the kid's got those weird, like, kind of dipping at the sides of the eyes.  Katie Holmes' eyes.  What do they call that?  Slow-eyed?  The slow-eyed beauty. 
[00:10:30]  I don't know what that means.  Definitely Katie's eyes in this picture.  Yeah.  I'm kidding.  And Tom Cruise's, uh, hair.  But it could be a wig on the child.  Wow.  Katie's got the same hair, though.  She's got a big, thick, uh, had a dark hair.  So, I don't know what to make of it.  It's an Asian kid.  It's not their kid.  You'd think it's an Asian kid.  They were waiting for the eyes to round out.  That's why they were hoping.  They were putting pennies on it and taping them.  Hoping it would fix.  To round out.  Congratulations.  It's a bike messenger.  That's not their baby. 
[00:11:00]  Bugs me.  Well, it's definitely, uh, Katie Holmes' baby.  What nationality is she?  Does she have Asian?  Is she part Asian?  No.  She got, like, those Britney Spears eyes.  It's the same thing.  They kind of tip down at the corners.  But they're big.  And that's supposed to be, like...  That's supposed to be sexy.  By the way, Gaz from FBA is helping me out today.  Tim Meadows wasn't in that SNL skit.  The only skit I thought Tim Meadows was funny in on SNL, I was mistaken. 
[00:11:30]  It wasn't Tim Meadows.  It was Dave and Alan Greer, who was the host of that episode.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  No.  Steve's sorry.  That's okay.  So I thought I found an actual skit where Tim Meadows was funny on SNL, and I was wrong.  Wrong.  So what do you think of the baby picture there, huh?  I'm going to say, against Jimmy, I'm going to say it's at least hers.  It could have been an artificial insemination.  It could have been an artificial insemination thing going on, because as we know over the 
[00:12:00]  years, he has had trouble having kids with his previous wives.  I love all the little gossip.  I'm being a little gossip.  Yes.  We are some...  We're kvetching head-up wives.  Are you having tea with the neighbors or something?  No.  We should have laundry strung across this so we can talk over it.  I don't have tea with my neighbors.  I don't have anything with my neighbors.  I kind of got a wave from my neighbor the other day.  Didn't have the enthusiasm as it did months ago. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  When I think, you know, people thought a relationship might have been sparked up or something.  Still haven't returned any of the favors.  My neighbors, the little cakes that were brought over, remember months and months ago, I talked  about my neighbors bringing over little cakes and they were great and everything as a welcome  to the community kind of thing.  And I returned their favor by completely shunning everybody in the neighborhood like a shut-in. 
[00:13:00]  A shut-in or a shut-out because most of the time these days is spent in hotel rooms.  I get to stay home for one day and it's pack the bags back out on the road doing our thing.  So, no, the neighbors, I barely see them anymore.  Barely see them.  And then I'm trying to get upholstery for certain furniture.  You can't just buy furniture anymore, Opie. 
[00:13:30]  Yes, you can.  Pottery barn.  Yeah.  Made to order.  You can't.  I'll take a brown one.  You can't.  I'd love to.  And a bowl of rocks for my table, please.  I need a bowl of rocks and something to hold some potpourri.  Those big candles look so nice until you get them home.  And you're like, what's wrong with me?  What did I buy?  Fat candle.  So, I thought.  I bought like a miniature canoe.  A canoe.  A miniature wooden canoe that was filled with pebbles and three or four little candles you place in it. 
[00:14:00]  What the hell are you going to do with that?  I think I've lit the candles once so far.  But it looks so good in Pottery Barn when I walked through there one day.  I got, I had to go to, you know, a place where they have furniture that you pick out, like catalogs.  Good stuff.  And then you got to go through swatches of material to decide what it's going to be upholstered in. 
[00:14:30]  And then that's, you know, you got to take it home and look at it with the floor and the walls.  Dude, what a, what a, what a boring pain this is.  This procedure is.  And every time I go there to this place, I'm a zombie because it's after we're done here.  I walk into the place, sit down and just looking at these swatches.  And my girlfriend's like, what do you think of this one?  I go, that's beautiful.  That's great.  Like, I don't.  Just let her do it. 
[00:15:00]  Because you don't care in the end.  That's what I said.  I really don't care.  I add in a little input.  I'm like, you know, all right, that really sucks, you know, but that's fine by me and everything.  And the woman that's working with us saw the Letterman appearance and said, I had no idea that he, you know, was so talkative.  Because I get that.  What am I supposed to do?  Neither did I, actually.  I was pretty amazed by that.  Myself. 
[00:15:30]  Didn't it tip you off outside when Anthony had the wow stickers and he was just crossing Opie off them with a marker?  I did not.  Opie got some very, very funny lines.  I had a chance to be a star.  Well, maybe the next time we're on Letterman.  You got some very good lines in.  I actually didn't notice, to be honest, that you, I didn't think that you talked that much.  I didn't notice it at all until, like, everybody said that.  No, I went back and forth.  And then Opie had some great lines.  And some great facial.  A stripper line was great. 
[00:16:00]  I had some great facial expressions.  A strip club.  And I clapped a lot.  You talked to Dave.  I thought Hollywood.  You had some funnies.  I thought Hollywood would be calling me by now.  Hollywood.  Anthony, a star is born with Anthony on Letterman.  Disillusionment.  No.  All the movie offers have been coming in.  Right.  I want that picture.  Godfather.  All right.  Where are we?  So upholstery, neighbors. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  The neighbors.  Baggots.  What else?  But now I'm hearing, now again, I'm driving in.  And what do I hear on the news on the way in?  Well, they took off for the summer, but the Nassau County home invaders are back.  Apparently they were in Levittown.  Not too close to me or anything, but, you know, still my county.  And broke into some guy's house, beat him with a crowbar, tied him up, stole his money  and jewelry, and left him. 
[00:17:00]  These goddamn home invaders, man.  Oh, animals.  Get your own jobs and stuff.  Yeah, right.  Get your own jobs and stuff.  I was listening to the news on the way in, and they said that they took the summer off.  Yeah, they took the summer off.  The home invaders decided maybe to vacation in the Hamptons, and they would get back to  breaking into homes in the fall.  Yeah, what the hell do they think?  They are Oceans 12?  They're breaking into play?  It's not that classy an act that they're taking the summer off. 
[00:17:30]  Maybe they found some new marks.  Maybe it's just easier in the summer to walk up to someone and punch him in the face after  asking what time it is.  Excuse me, what time is it?  Boof!  You're down for the count.  You're broke.  Why can't the Nassau County Police take care of this problem?  They're trying, Opie.  They're trying their hardest.  They sure know how to pull you over if you're going 60 miles an hour along an expressway.  Don't you rag on the Nassau County Police Department.  I support them wholeheartedly. 
[00:18:00]  Wholeheartedly.  I support them.  They get there in seconds.  I know a lot of their names, and they pass by the house.  It's very nice of them.  But, yeah, the home invaders, again.  Now I've got to deal with that.  Arm to the hilt, though.  Arm to the hilt!  I defy you!  I defy...  I beg of you.  Come on.  Come on in. 
[00:18:30]  Give out your address.  Dare him.  All right.  Never do that.  Not because of the home invaders.  Because of our stupid fans.  Yeah.  There'll be no gang.  There'll be just a bunch of fat guys yelling, yeah!  Ripping up my lawn.  Selling it on eBay.  Get off my lawn.  All right.  Why don't we bring this whole break around?  And here's Katie Couric breaking the Surrey Cruise picture story.  Ooh.  Here's another new feature.  It's called Snapshots.  And we begin with some vintage ones from one of the early CBS News broadcasts. 
[00:19:00]  The anchor was Douglas Edwards, and the photos are of 19-week-old Prince Charles back in 1949.  This perhaps is my favorite of Bonnie King Charlie to be of the United Kingdom.  So, in keeping with tradition, we have some very special baby pictures tonight.  An exclusive first look at Vanity Fair's newest cover girl.  She's Surrey Cruise, daughter of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes. 
[00:19:30]  After much speculation about why she's been undercover so long, this is proof positive that, yes, Surrey, she does exist.  The Annie Leibovitz photo shoot, incidentally, was top secret, and the article was completed in an undisclosed location under heavy security.  The magazine hits newsstands tomorrow.  Oh, that's going to sell a few copies, huh?  Did you see what this phony bitch did?  She's on the nightly news, right?  Right.  And this tabloid story.  Yeah.  You know, it's nice that their kid is healthy. 
[00:20:00]  Good.  That's not newsworthy on, like, Dan Rather-level news with World News.  She puts it into a new feature called Snapshots, so it won't seem like the Entertainment Tonight crap that it is.  Yeah.  That's exactly what she did.  Tied in with Prince Charles.  What does that have to do with it?  Trying to make it legitimate.  Legitimate.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Look, England does it.  Well, yeah.  So can we.  Your nightly news can't have that tabloid angle, Jimmy.  That's exactly what they did.  But they also know that tabloid angle brings in the viewers. 
[00:20:30]  So there's a fine little balance there they're going to attempt to do.  She's bringing that Today Show crap to the news.  That's who you want to break stories like 9-11 and other terrorism stories.  Oh, wait.  It's Katie.  What channel is she on?  Who knows?  I love Katie Couric.  What channel is she on?  And I'm so happy that she's on CBS.  Welcome aboard, Katie.  To the family, Katie.  There you go, Jimmy.  Welcome to the CBS family.  There you go.  You didn't get the shock treatment like Anthony and I did yesterday afternoon.  I love Katie.  You've got to buy into this, Jimmy. 
[00:21:00]  What?  I love Katie.  You've got to buy into this.  Oh, Katie Couric?  Yeah.  Oh, I love her.  Yeah, she's good.  She's good.  Yeah.  I don't know who.  Who's the other one?  What's her name?  Who's on channel 7 or 4?  I wouldn't know, Anthony.  I only watch CBS Evening News.  Yeah, someone's on ABC or NBC, but I don't even know who their names are.  There's one real old broad that they photograph her through some Vaseline and cheesecloth every morning.  You could barely see her. 
[00:21:30]  It looks like you're watching her with Grandpa's cataracts in your eyes.  That's Diane Sawyer.  Diane Sawyer.  But we don't watch her.  That's the one we were talking about.  What a uck.  We only watch CBS programming.  And Katie Couric, welcome.  And tell Eric, by the way, if he speaks out against Katie Couric again, he's fired.  Exactly, Eric.  You're treading on some thin ice, my friend.  You and that bowling shirt will be out on your ear.  He priced another awful shirt from this kid. 
[00:22:00]  How do you do it?  Yeah, what is that?  It is kind of a bowling shirt.  Of course it is.  You're dressed like Dolph Sweet.  Smack you right in the mouth.  To drop a bowling ball on your hand.  All right.  Well, I don't know if we got anything done during this first break.  Of course we did.  I'm threatened.  What did we learn so far?  What did we learn?  What did we learn?  We learned that, once again, the home invaders are back and I have to pull out my AR-15 and my shotgun again. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  And keep them close.  And my rapier, just in case I need some hand-to-hand combat.  What else did we learn?  That you talk a lot on national TV.  That I yap.  I yap like a chatty Cathy on national television.  But we knew that, didn't we?  By the way, if you haven't seen us on David Letterman yet, go to YouTube and throw in Opie and Anthony in the search.  It's there.  About a hundred times, by the way.  A hundred times.  People keep posting our Letterman appearance. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  And we were invited back in December.  In December, we'll be back on.  So I'll have a second shot at talking.  You guys should get a picture with the two of you on either side of him.  He's 6'6".  You gotta get that.  That's a great shot.  Except for that quick handshake before we went out, he came over to the wings and shook our hands.  And the one when we left, I just wanted out of there.  I wanted to flee the situation while it was still on the up and up before I could screw it up. 
[00:23:30]  What else did we learn?  We love Katie Couric.  Katie Couric is a new addition to the CBS family and we welcome her.  And you're picking out upholstery.  Yeah.  The upholstery thing and how dull it is.  All right.  We learned you had a canoe full of candles that you don't use.  Ah, yeah.  See?  And Jimmy's very important now.  Because he's a big boy now.  Yes.  That he's got a real corporate card.  We didn't learn that yet.  We didn't learn that yet.  Oh, damn it.  Now we just did.  Oh, the fact that I got my American Express card. 
[00:24:00]  That's the big story for the 7 o'clock hour.  Big platinum.  Gold platinum.  They sent me my package.  I'm a member of the family.  Yeah.  And we'll take your credit card stories next.  And you get 18,000 pieces of junk mail that you'll rip up.  Guys, I was working on like little interest rate and financing jokes all night.  So when we come back.  All right.  Looking forward to it.  All righty.  We are going to take a break.  Yes.  Uh, it's the only virus spreading across America on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[00:24:30]  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow stickers are your tickets to a successful Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow stickers have many other uses?  I sliced out both my kidneys and I patched up the wounds with Wow stickers.  But, but dude, how do you pee?  Oh, boy.  Can't pee.  This was incredibly nearsighted.  Opie and Anthony!  Can't go pee.  Can't go pee.  Can't go pee.  Can't go pee.  Pee, pee, dance.  Pee, pee, dance.  Gotta go pee.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live. 
[00:25:00]  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It mean everything.  We should have added that to the song. 
[00:25:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show, The Own A Virus, on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Get yourself a Wow bumper sticker.  We need one, one way to get Wow stickers.  Just one centralized location that people can send their self-addressed stent envelope.  But that's too obvious, though.  That will never happen.  And what would they do?  State the station that they want it from and we would ship it from the main location.  Yeah.  So then everyone could get a Wow sticker and maybe even have just the generic one. 
[00:26:00]  I don't know.  Because there's a lot of people out there that want the Wow bumper stickers.  Yeah.  But we have to depend on the radio station that you're hearing us on to do the right thing  and get those Wow stickers made and have a way to distribute them to our listeners.  And they've got other things to worry about besides just us.  Do they?  It doesn't really get done.  Do they?  Yeah, apparently they do.  Like what?  I don't know.  21 hours of programming? 
[00:26:30]  Exactly.  Well, the homemade Wow signs work, too.  I'm telling you, there's ladies out there.  Do you want me to go to the phones right now?  There are ladies out there right now just wandering around looking for Wow stickers and Wow signs  so they can flash you.  Yes.  Happens every single day.  It's kind of whip them out whenever now.  Although this whole concept started on Wednesdays.  Hence, Wow, whip them out Wednesdays.  Right. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  We have the Stingray thing again.  Everyone's still mourning the death of Steve Irwin.  Well, it's only been a couple of days.  Of course, the morning process should take, what, three days, four?  Yeah, they'll probably move on to another story by Friday.  I'm a little surprised, the dangerous, dangerous ray, little sea ray thing, stingrays stories  haven't come up as much as I thought they were going to be. 
[00:27:30]  We got one.  We do?  Yeah.  Thank goodness.  Yeah.  Very dangerous, you know.  The killers of the sea.  Well, you got to love your local news.  Stingrays are basically harmless.  Basically.  Basically harmless.  What did we learn yesterday?  17 deaths since the start?  Since the start of time?  Ever, ever.  17.  He was the 17th to go, I guess.  Right.  So, they're harmless.  But the news, of course, they'll tell you that stingrays in general are harmless. 
[00:28:00]  But.  But.  Experts say stingray attacks are rare.  But just how rare?  And are you in danger the next time you take a dip?  Is this another situation where you have to be afraid to go to the beach?  We're going to ask the doctor.  That's coming up next hour.  But how rare?  Rare is rare.  Is this another situation?  How can you say how rare?  It's rare.  The word rare stands on its own.  Right?  How rare?  Sort of rare. 
[00:28:30]  Yes.  Kind of rare, but yet not as rare as it could be.  Like to mash her teeth into the news desk.  Grab the back of her head and smash it in.  How rare is it when you're talking into a prompter when a fist just crashes into your gums?  Pretty rare, but look, it happened to you.  Here's the story.  Never swim near the base of the water when you're doing scuba diving in warm water where you know there are stingrays.  Because, again, as rare as it is, they may come up.  It's a bottom feeder. 
[00:29:00]  But they don't come up.  They don't.  No.  You know how many people scuba dive every day?  There are thousands and thousands of people scuba diving as we speak right now.  Ooh.  That's scary.  Thousands.  Why get up so early?  Huh?  Yeah.  Why get up so early to scuba dive?  It's not early somewhere else, though.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  We're old.  And when you do go down to the Caribbean, you do start very early in the morning if you want to do some diving.  I'll bet you they talked to a couple of doctors until they got the response they wanted.  I'll bet you at least one doctor said, no, there's been less than 20 deaths since the big rock hit the planet and shook it into an orbit. 
[00:29:30]  So I would say that you can walk right on stingrays and basically they're faggots.  You know how rare it is?  We said it yesterday.  I went to the Cayman Islands with Lindsay, and we went to Stingray City, and we're in four feet of water.  And you jump off the back of the boat, assuming they know what the hell they're doing down there, but we realize they have no rules or regulations or laws for that matter.  They just â€“ someone discovered that this would be a cool thing to do, and that's all you have to worry about. 
[00:30:00]  And stupid Americans, we just go with it like, okay, they know what they're doing.  Because there's agencies here for everything.  There's some kind of agency that's looked into it and made sure it's safe for you.  And if not, you can sue them, and they need insurance and things.  But you go to these islands, and you think it's the same thing.  Hey, they're putting â€“ it's got to be safe.  They couldn't do this if it wasn't safe.  Meanwhile, no, it's not safe at all.  So they have this area in the Cayman Islands.  You take a little day trip, and you jump off the back of this boat. 
[00:30:30]  You're in four feet of water.  It's called Stingray City, and they throw some kind of chummy whatever stingrays like to eat down in the water, right?  Chum.  Next thing you know, you're surrounded by lots and lots of stingrays.  I said about 100 yesterday.  Maybe it's a little less than that, but there is just a lot.  And it's dopey Taurus.  You're one of about 20 in the water, only four feet, you know, so you can easily step on these things.  They're swarming all over you like crazy.  And no one is getting stung by the barbs. 
[00:31:00]  Why?  And then the big guy, the captain who's been doing this for 50, 60 years that has pretty much skin cancer over his entire body, he allows you to pick them up and hold them.  And they're flapping because they don't want to be picked up, and they're still not stinging you.  Why wouldn't they sting?  And then they give you a stingray massage where you lean over, and the captain, like, kind of puts the stingray on your back, and it flaps back and forth, gives you a nice little massage.  That's stupid.  They do this trip, I don't know, four times a day, every day of the year, 20 dopey Taurus that, you know, you panic when you're in that situation, so it's very easy to step on one of these things. 
[00:31:30]  And no one's getting stung down there.  What's the face look like on a stingray?  Does it have a face?  It looks like a big water bat.  I hate them.  Yeah, big water bat.  You know, one of those wacky mouths with the little flaps on the side.  Right, right.  And they got eyeballs, like, on the top of their head.  So.  Pretty weird-looking things.  But here's the news story.  They're going to tell you that, you know, to be careful and not do certain things, even though only 17 people since the start of time have died because of a stingray. 
[00:32:00]  Never swim near the base of the water when you're doing scuba diving in warm water where you know there are stingrays.  Because, again, as rare as it is, they may come up.  It's a bottom feeder.  It's staying.  It's always going to be down there.  It's not like swimming around at the top.  And if you're in a kayak and you think you're safe, you're not.  That goes right through a quarter inch of plywood.  Oh, shut up.  I know.  What?  The stingrays are the new jaws.  Let me ask, please, can you show me one time a stingray has thrown its stinger up through a kayak or anything else? 
[00:32:30]  What a dope.  I bet that's never happened.  I'll bet you have a better chance of getting AIDS from a needle left around in that jackass's office than you do from getting stung through a kayak.  That's never happened.  Not once.  No, never.  But leave it to the news because they got to bring the fear into every stupid story out there.  Can we find out who that doctor is because he's on a news story.  Maybe we could get him and say that we'd like to interview him and I think we should ask him some very poignant questions. 
[00:33:00]  I bet there are eight million things that can go wrong and kill you in a kayak quicker and sooner and more obvious of it happening than a stingray coming through the bottom of your boat with this stinger.  Anything.  Lightning hitting it.  You falling off a waterfall, tipping over and drowning.  Those things millions of times probably happen. 
[00:33:30]  And this guy brings up that it's going to spike the bottom of your kayak.  What a jerk off this doctor is.  You think you're safe, you're not.  So you're poked in the butt.  Who cares?  You would live.  Thing will go right through wood.  Goes through steel battleship hulls.  I've seen it happen.  You live in the Midwest?  Don't think you're safe.  They flick that tail.  It gets on the tailwind.  It carries.  All of a sudden it lands on your children.  They have wings.  They could end up in cornfields.  Ugh.  I've seen it.  You wouldn't get stung by one of these things if you lifted its tail and tickled the spike and had sex with it. 
[00:34:00]  Basically that's what you do at Stingray City except for the sex part.  You do everything to them.  You're petting them.  You're holding them.  You're pretty much stepping on them because they're everywhere.  Oof.  Oh, it's that creepy.  Yeah, I agree.  You know, now you're going to think about it.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know if I'd be brave enough to go do that now.  All he's got to do is swing that tail.  Wham.  I'll tell you they sting you sometimes, but they're probably not deadly if they just whack you. 
[00:34:30]  No, they're not deadly.  They hit this idiot in the heart.  The venom of the Stingray is quite painful, but it will not take down a human in general.  It's supposed to affect your circulation.  So I guess if they nail you right in the heart, there's a problem.  A really big one hit him, and they're saying maybe if he didn't yank the Stinger out or whatever it is, it would have been okay.  Oh, my God.  I've got to talk to Christopher from Hoboken.  Christopher.  Yeah, when I was down somewhere, I don't know, I think St. Thomas or something, now that the way you said it before you picked up the line, maybe I'm wrong. 
[00:35:00]  But I could have sworn that the guys told us that they took the barbs off of these ones.  That was to make you comfortable.  When I went to Stingray City in the Cayman Islands, it was impossible to take these barbs out.  It was an open ocean.  Oh, they made us feel like it was like a netted in area that they were in captivity or something, and that they pulled the bars off of these things.  Not where I went.  Maybe where you went, they had it a little different.  Maybe they actually had rules and regulations.  They put one piece of net up by the island, and the other piece of net up by Florida. 
[00:35:30]  I remember they told us to shuffle our feet, and that would keep them from stinging you or keep you from stepping on them.  Just keep shuffling your feet.  Right, right.  Shuffle.  All right.  Wait.  Thank you, sir.  Shuffle your feet underwater.  All right, here's the rest of the story.  Oh, my feet touching the bottom.  So we moved back a little bit so the Stingray could go through a kayak and pierce you.  Yeah.  It's always going to be down there.  It's not like swimming around at the top.  And if you're in a kayak and you think you're safe, you're not.  That goes right through a quarter inch of plywood. 
[00:36:00]  It can also go through boats.  Actually, fiberglass is one of the only things that can penetrate, and it's rated to be safe against stingrays.  But, again, unless you're provoking this thing or stepping on it, it's not going to attack you.  Right.  There has to be some change in its environment to make it nervous.  Sharks love to feed on it.  So if they think a shark is coming nearby, that gets them a little spooked, and they jump up.  And they jump up.  So even without you doing anything, if it thinks a shark is in the area, it's going to put it through the bottom of your wooden boat.  Right.  A boat or a kayak or a battleship or anything. 
[00:36:30]  When are they going to come out and say that Steve Irwin kind of provoked the stingray to do what it does?  It was a combination of Steve Irwin and the cameraman.  Steve Irwin and the stingray was swimming in towards the cameraman.  It was a face shot.  The guy was facing him.  They're swimming toward the cameraman.  So now the stingray has to swim toward the cameraman with Steve Irwin right above it.  So he didn't want to do that.  So what he did was he spun around to swim back out the other way, away from the cameraman. 
[00:37:00]  And the second he spun around, he also flipped his tail up and caught him square in the chest.  And then off he went.  I just have a feeling that's exactly what Steve Irwin was trying to get out of the stingray.  Because we've all seen him provoke the crocs and all that.  Oh yeah, and then he'd be like, did you see what he did?  Right.  And I bet you...  His tail came up and almost hit me.  If that tail would have struck me, a spike would have been...  You know, and that would have been like his big thing. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, I got it here, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  Go with it.  Rosie was very funny yesterday on The View.  This is the only time I've ever agreed with awful Linda Stassi, old cadaver hand in the New York Post.  But she wrote a review.  And who's the other one with the Hasselback?  That stupid kind of half a mullet blonde on The View?  Was saying, the difficulty of telling your kids the crocodile hunter's death.  You know, she said it was hard.  And Rosie said, how about, you know that reckless guy who wrestled alligators and hung his baby over a crocodile? 
[00:38:00]  He got killed by a stingray in the ocean.  That's how you tell your kids.  Which was very funny.  That's ballsy.  And did Barbara get all angry at her?  Who knows, Barbara.  She makes me nauseous.  Barbara Walters...  Barbara Walters just gave up her own TV show to Rosie O'Donnell.  Yeah, had to.  Completely gave it up.  You watch.  You watch.  Rosie's going to completely take over that show.  You think either the ratings really go up because she's on there and people start watching and they have to deal with her.  Or Barbara gets so pissed she just throws her off. 
[00:38:30]  Well, when we were watching yesterday, you could tell that Barbara is so out of her league.  Rosie completely took over the show.  And she's out of touch with everything.  Yeah, they were joking about, what, Google and...  Yeah.  I can Google.  And blogs.  I can Google.  You can.  Yeah, blog.  I don't even know what a blog is.  What?  Oh, you do a talk show every morning.  Perhaps you should be a little informed.  And Rosie O'Donnell will wind up having more juice in that show than Barbara Walters.  Barbara Walters is a cryptic... 
[00:39:00]  She's a dead person.  Yeah.  I guarantee you they want to eventually squeeze her out.  She's so out of touch.  No.  Mark my word.  It's Rosie's show from now on.  What channel's that on?  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  We don't watch ABC.  I'm sorry.  ABC?  Yeah, no.  That's from ABC.  I don't like that show.  Horrid.  It's all about CBS.  Horrid network.  CBS radio, CBS TV.  Horrid network.  CBS evening news with Kitty Kirk.  We're all about CBS.  Just trying to show some of the listeners we are truly the corporate shills and puppets that you call us. 
[00:39:30]  By the way, getting back to Steve Irwin's death, a lot of controversy about the video of his death.  Will it be shown?  It is on video.  The guy, his manager saw it.  Right.  And said he would not like to see it shown to anybody.  It's very upsetting.  You're watching someone die.  It's tragic, horrible to watch.  Well, there are no plans to air video capturing the shocking death. 
[00:40:00]  But media experts predicted yesterday it will soon be circulating on the Internet.  Right now, there's one guy that has the tape.  It's at the police station down there.  There's some Australian police station.  So you think those guys have already dubbed a couple copies?  Yeah, definitely ran off some copies.  You know the gallows humor cops have.  Probably even worse down there.  A whole nation of displaced criminals from England, aren't they?  So they've probably got some kind of a gallows humor. 
[00:40:30]  So, yeah, hand out a few DVDs of it.  Makes the rounds.  Someone puts it up on the web somewhere.  Ends up on YouTube.  They want it destroyed, but Staten said every effort will be made to keep the video away from the public.  Media experts said they doubted the footage could be kept under wraps.  The key point is once there's something on film, it's impossible to keep it contained.  Now, the bear guy, even though that wasn't film and it was just audio, the crazy bear guy getting eaten never made it out. 
[00:41:00]  But isn't it amazing?  These guys who put themselves in this position, they get killed, and the people around them suddenly dub it, like, too personal to be shown or heard.  And meanwhile, you have to watch the ramblings of this idiot every week.  That's what I was rooting for the whole time is for his head to get lopped off.  You think I want to see some dope in shorts wrestling with a crocodile?  I want to see him get killed.  That's why I watched it.  That's pretty much it, why everybody watched.  He's stronger than the gator, is he?  That's not why the kids were watching. 
[00:41:30]  That's true.  Let's think about the kids.  Yeah, you're right.  They're suffering.  They're suffering today.  No, they're not.  You don't even tell them.  If I had kids, they'd be like, what happened to the crocodile?  Who?  What are you talking about?  Get away from me.  That's what I'd say.  That's how you handle your kids their parents.  You don't even answer them.  What crocodile thing?  It's fine.  Yeah, he didn't eat his vegetables, so he died of cancer.  That's a show.  How many kids do you think Mr. Rogers is still alive?  I was flipping through the channels the other night, and for some reason, Mr. Rogers was 
[00:42:00]  on.  It was one morning when I was up.  I was on Casino Time, and Mr. Rogers was on.  So I stopped just to watch because it's such a creepy-ass show that you've got to kind of  watch it for a few seconds.  And it's like, this guy's been dead for years, but kids are still watching his show and don't  know he's dead.  You'd think the parent comes over and goes, by the way, Jimmy, he's dead.  No, they enjoy him putting his shoes on and his sweater and showing him the, you know, 
[00:42:30]  Mr. Speedy Delivery and the trolley and all that stuff.  And that's what happens.  You don't got to tell kids that people are dead if they're on TV.  They're on TV.  They're still alive.  That's fun.  You wasn't going to see him live.  You'd think the kid was ever going to see Steve Irwin walking around alive.  No, you only see him on TV, so you keep it that way.  If they ask, what happened?  Why is he on TV?  Oh, he got an accident, but he'll be back.  He'll be fine.  And then you switch channels.  Oh, there he is.  He's fine, see? 
[00:43:00]  That's how you deal with stupid kids, because kids are morons.  Kids will buy into that.  They buy anything.  Oh, are they stupid?  Children are stupid.  See, I think it's fun to tell them.  I think it's fun to tell them, yeah.  He's dead, and someday I'll be dead, and so will you.  When you put a fake stingray in their bed, and you throw them in and turn the lights off.  Bad boy!  It's going to sting you and make you dead like Steve Irwin. 
[00:43:30]  Mommy!  Mommy!  It's going to sting you where the bathing suit covers.  Dirty boy!  Where did the stingray touch you?  All right.  We're going to take a break and continue with some other things.  You know what we haven't done?  We started the Down Syndrome couple getting married.  Oh, we did start that.  We haven't finished that yet.  This is a sweet story of love and overcoming.  Ah, forget it.  It's hysterical.  And we'll get into other things that people are talking about today. 
[00:44:00]  Yes.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  You and I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Ready?  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey, good morning. 
[00:44:30]  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  We're very happy about that.  Where's little Jimmy Norton?  He's in the can.  I think he went to the can.  I was on YouTube last night.  Yeah.  Better than TV.  Yeah, I was on there last night doing a little uploading, as a matter of fact.  Yeah?  Yeah, I spent a little time with the video that I took. 
[00:45:00]  That we took over there at the virus show at the PNC.  And the tailgate party.  And us driving the golf cart through the crowd with Jimmy Norton and his ass hanging out.  Yeah, mooning everybody.  Mooning the crowd from a fast-moving golf cart as people were cheering.  It was a moment.  Quite a moment.  It brought a tear to my eye.  And I put that up there.  So that's up there.  How to find it?  I don't know. 
[00:45:30]  It's not showing up yet.  Does it take a while once you post?  It takes a day or two.  So it'll be up there probably by tomorrow.  So I put a bunch of key keywords.  Yeah.  Throw O.B. and Anthony into the search.  I think there's over 700 videos now you can check out that have something to do with us.  We put something up.  Do they approve it first?  Like they look it over?  Oh, no.  It's the Wild Wild West.  Yeah.  It is the Wild Wild West.  We try to police it a little bit and tell them, hey, man, you take that down or whatever.  But in general, it's the Wild Wild West.  What I did see last night was your TV commercial, Jimmy, for the Hammerstein show. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We shot two of them, and I'm doing that November 10th, and we actually shot a commercial for  it in the street.  It was kind of embarrassing.  I saw one.  Yeah, I saw that on YouTube.  No, on YouTube.  That's what's great about you.  I'm watching it right now.  There you go.  Jim Norton's TV commercial on YouTube.  It's funny.  This is how great the listeners are.  You know, so I posted some footage from the Dallas show, and I was like, oh, this is  kind of new material.  That's just the only thing I care about is newer stuff.  And you can write me an email.  I'm sorry, man.  I took it down.  I was like, the listeners are great, man.  That's cool. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Very nice of them.  Yes.  We appreciate it.  E-Rock, now the video that Anthony just put up, how'd you find it?  That's not the one he put up.  The mooning one is right to the right.  Oh, all right.  Oh, forget it.  How'd you find mine?  Go back to sleep.  How'd you find mine?  Would you just end it?  Go back.  Just go back to sleep.  We don't need you.  That's not the video.  That's my commercial.  That's not the video.  If you want to see me.  That's not the video of me pointing at Jimmy's naked ass.  That's somebody's icon for their YouTube page. 
[00:47:00]  It's just a still photo.  Uh-oh.  Had to come from somewhere, though.  Fuck.  Yeah, where'd it come from, then?  All right, then I apologize.  To me, it looks like the video, because it's me on the back of a golf cart.  Don't apologize.  Jimmy is mooning, and I'm pointing at his ass.  To me, that looks exactly like the video we took.  He'll earn that wrath in no time.  Yeah.  Oh, but that's...  What is that, then?  I was linked on somebody else's page.  Oh, it was?  Yeah.  Hmm.  But how do they get the video? 
[00:47:30]  All right, it'll be up on YouTube for everybody.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  For the keywords for my commercial, you enter can't and act, and it just pops right up.  By the way, you rock.  I'm not sorry, because I'm sure you did something wrong this morning.  Showed up.  I'm so awful.  I was all happy to finally contribute on the Panasonic read.  It was my first live read.  I was nervous.  I had nothing.  Yeah, Jimmy's helping out on the reads now, which is so adorably cute.  Well, because he got a TV. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  But now they want to take the TV back after that live read.  Oh.  They were actually, as I was doing it, they actually had a guy walking into my apartment  and jimmying it open and putting the TV on the card and going, thank you, but no thanks.  You know what I said?  Ant's talking about it.  I just went, yeah, it's crisp.  It's a crisp picture.  And you said it can hang on the wall.  Yeah, it can hang on the wall.  There's a newsflash.  Plasmas can hang on the wall.  Welcome to 1985 information.  It's crisp, folks. 
[00:48:30]  The new Panasonic.  I have nothing.  And do you know that images show up on it?  Do you know that?  I was hoping to get a blurry TV myself.  I'm awful.  Jesus, Jimmy.  We love Panasonic and their plasma TV.  They're right in front of me.  I don't know what to say.  I'm not good at the live reads.  I got nervous.  Did you get a little scared?  I did.  I wanted to say something because I do like it and I didn't know how to express that,  so I just blurted it out crisp.  What do you guys love more, Katie Kirk or Panasonic?  Panasonic plasma TV.  Watching her on a Panasonic.  Oh, wow.  It's a perfect combination.  It's better than sex. 
[00:49:00]  Chill.  Matter of fact.  You're a corporate puppet man.  I'm such a corporate guy.  When I get my flat screen delivered and put up on my wall, I'm going to make sure I only  get Channel 2 here in New York.  Is that it?  Which is CBS.  It's going to disable every other channel.  That's right.  That's what I do for the company.  You're a good man.  All my friends' radios are tuned to this station.  Okay, here we go.  This is a quickie and it's probably a who cares, but Sam, who's celebrating his birthday 
[00:49:30]  today, brought it to our attention.  It might be worth a listen.  How old is she?  Huh?  Sam, how old?  Oh, I don't know.  Someone suggested that we get him black and white cookies today.  Oh, I think that was Pat.  We should get him a log cake and then just shove it in his mouth until he chose to death.  Wait, Sam is coming in the room, but of course you can't officially be on the radio without  your theme song, which I can't find.  E-Rock will find it. 
[00:50:00]  He certainly will.  Oh, look at the faces he makes.  He makes these faces like, shut up.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Sam's not black.  His ancestor's Thomas Jefferson.  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thong.  Well, his skin's kind of weird. 
[00:50:30]  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure?  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a, mm-mm, white or a, mm-mm, yeah, we're teasing, you know, cause he's  white with an afro.  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  He ain't black.  Happy birthday, Sam.  Thank you. 
[00:51:00]  How old, uh, how old are you?  I'm going to guess 24.  23.  Oh.  Hey, he happily blurted that out.  I was young.  Younger.  Yeah, how weird was that?  23.  23.  Like someone's going to guess 32 in the room, you know.  I know, what a fool.  It was obviously 23 or 24.  You just graduated college.  Sam would look good in Winnie the Pooh feety pajamas.  That's what he should be running around in just feety pajamas.  A little plastic feety pajamas sound on the linoleum. 
[00:51:30]  So, Sam, what's this, uh, Jessica Simpson thing about?  A listener sent it in.  It's, uh, Jessica Simpson was on the Today Show recently, and, uh, she has laryngitis.  She said, oh, actually a blood vessel burst in her, uh, lung or something.  Oh.  Not in her lung.  What?  In her vocal cord.  In her vocal cord.  In her lung.  Ow.  Oh, no.  Can that happen to you?  Probably, yeah.  Can I ask a very obvious question?  If that would happen, would that affect your voice, you think? 
[00:52:00]  I don't have a clue.  All right.  What were you saying?  That she's constantly gurgling on her own blood and dying slowly?  Oh, mighty.  When she had an aneurysm.  The story goes, she, uh, popped a blood vessel in her vocal cord, but she was on the Today  Show, and she had to sing.  And, uh, there are a bunch of phonies over there because she sings.  Yeah.  And according to Sam and other people, it sounded like she was just lip syncing to the record.  Hmm.  And then, of course, Matt has to, like, come on after she sings, she fake sings. 
[00:52:30]  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, tell everyone how brave she is that she went through with, uh, trying to sing.  He was lip syncing?  Even though she's in this condition with this laryngitis or whatever, this, uh, popped  blood vessel in her vocal cords.  Oh, yeah.  She could somehow belt it out and not carry an interview.  So, here she is singing.  Okay.  Live, quote.  Yeah.  On the Today Show last week.  Jessica Simpson's new album dropped in stores, as they say in the music industry, on Tuesday. 
[00:53:00]  Then, a little later in the week, she developed a throat problem.  She's drinking something that's gnarly looking here.  I mean, I don't even, I don't think I want to know what that is.  I don't either.  All right.  But she's, she's been a real trooper, and she's going to sing another song for us right  now.  Ladies and gentlemen, once again, Jessica Simpson.  Just a piece.  Don't worry.  We got it.  So, you guys get to pull me out with this one already.  That's her voice.  Wow.  Short.  You know, this was the T-shirt song.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Ooh.  Real me is a silent girl.  The feelings are in it all the time.  Wish I could save the world.  Like I was super girl.  I can let my head down.  I can say anything.  Ladies and gentlemen, you know you had to run before I hit the ground.  With nothing but a T-shirt on.  I never felt so beautiful.  Baby, if I see my baby, I'm on to now. 
[00:54:00]  Now that I'm with you.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  God, I love the T-shirt song.  The T-shirt song.  And then she was really raspy.  Well, then now here's her talking.  That had to be the most nerve-wracking thing you've ever done in your life.  I have no voice.  It's a miracle that I'm actually singing right now.  No way. 
[00:54:30]  No way?  Well, and you've done a little singing in your day.  Is that possible?  It is possible to be able to sing and not talk when you're done.  Is it different muscles you use in your throat?  Yeah.  But, I mean, if I were to pull that off that cleanly, no.  She was doing those trills and stuff.  When did you actually develop laryngitis?  It's not laryngitis.  I busted a blood vessel in my vocal cord.  How did you do that?  I don't know.  I don't know if it was like a screaming, crying attack or a cough attack or a sneeze or what. 
[00:55:00]  And so what did the doctor tell you?  The doctor said, basically, rest your voice for like five or six days.  And you say, okay, that's a great idea, except I've got a new album coming out this week.  Yeah, and he told me that on Tuesday, the day my album came out.  And I'm like, oh, dang it.  It's like the worst timing ever.  Did you have to cancel a lot of stuff?  When is her time off?  I did.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I'll be making everything up, I promise.  And next time I sing, I'll be singing my booty off.  Okay.  So what do you think? 
[00:55:30]  I don't think she was singing.  She's pretty.  Too many of those trills and stuff.  You could sing.  You could belt out like rock guys can do that and then get off stage and be like.  But if you're doing those like very delicate trilly things at the end of the song that she was doing,  no way.  Then you step off and go, I have a personal blood vessel. 
[00:56:00]  I used to try the jokes.  By the way, Ashley Simpson, much hotter than Jessica Simpson.  Is she?  Yeah.  Now that she got the schnoz job?  She got the nose job and now she's hotter than her older sister.  I don't even think I've seen her since the nose job.  Are you kidding?  No.  Why would I want to look at her?  What was wrong with her nose?  Was it too fat or long?  She has some kind of a bump thing going.  Not anymore.  Is that her now?  All right.  No.  Is that her now, Iraq? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  That's not bad.  Well, you should see some other pictures.  She's much hotter than Jessica now.  Much hotter.  Nude?  Is there any nude?  All right.  Anthony, obviously your chick doesn't get the gossip magazines.  Why, no?  You would know this stuff.  I watched some of the gossip shows, but I don't care about Ashley.  I turn it off.  You don't get it in style and Us Weekly and no.  No.  The rest of them.  I guess popular mechanics, popular science. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  That was a who cares moment on the Opie and Anthony show.  Whatever.  Well, I don't know.  We like to do a little pop culture.  We try.  I didn't think her voice sounded crisp.  Good addition to the conversation, Jim.  God, am I just awful?  You know, she's going to start a crazy trend, though.  The T-shirt song.  Now, I saw that performance, and I'm thinking, oh, the T-shirt song.  That's kind of cool.  Why is it?  What trend is that?  Well, Jessica Simpson, she could wear the T-shirt. 
[00:57:30]  With no bra, it would be hot as hell, right?  Yeah.  But I'm thinking about her audience, thinking about the older people in her audience now  thinking it's going to be cool to walk around the house with just a T-shirt, no bra on.  What happened?  Yeah.  I'm just looking at a picture that E-Rock put up.  Wow.  Of Jessica's cans.  Oh, she's got the nipple things pasted, too.  You can see the tape under it.  Look.  Yep.  That's so they don't pop out during a paparazzi. 
[00:58:00]  All right.  It's time for news teases, ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, thank God.  One of our favorite, favorite things we do on the Oakland A.  Prepare to be petrified, people.  Now, there's a couple things that go on here.  We do the latest news teases from around America.  Thank you if you helped us out.  You can send in your news teases to danny at foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  F-O-U-N-R-Y music.com.  Yep. 
[00:58:30]  Wow.  She's got a little, uh, little, uh, uh, uh, uh.  It looks like she's very cold.  No, no.  That's not.  That's the area.  Ariella.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Little ones.  Little ones.  Did I mention that Danny came over yesterday?  He brought me my phone, which I left.  Ugh.  Came up to my apartment.  You had him at your house?  I did, and he kind of stood awkwardly at the door, and I was like, well, do you want  to come in for a minute?  And he comes in, and we're talking.  And then I was like, ah, I'm going to make some coffee.  I'm like, you want some coffee?  He's like, well, if you're having some.  And then, like, five minutes later, my TV showed up, and I just kind of wanted Danny 
[00:59:00]  to leave, but I didn't have the heart to ask him.  Ugh.  Danny, at your house?  Yeah.  Where you and your wife sleep?  Where my children play with their toys.  Yeah.  I showed Danny my room.  I wanted to do something, but I hadn't told anybody first, but I really wanted to, like, put  my hands on his shoulders and kind of hit on him, but I'm like, no, because it all just  sound like I'm backing out of it when I said I was just kidding.  I wish I would have talked to you guys first.  I would have really made him uncomfortable.  Maybe not.  That would have been really scary.  I've been waiting for this moment, Jim. 
[00:59:30]  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.  You know, before we do the news teases, because some brand new audio just came in.  We'll set it up nice.  We'll do it in a few minutes here, actually.  Look at the news teases.  They scare me.  Well, Fox 5 did a sound-off about Steve Irwin's death tape.  What could possibly...  Oh, the tape.  Okay.  Because that's not just on his death.  Yeah, he should be dead.  No, he shouldn't.  Their sound-offs stink. 
[01:00:00]  Well, that's the big thing today.  Should it be released?  All right.  Should it be released?  Everyone's discussing it.  And Fox 5 had this to say.  The sound-off question of the day.  Now to tonight's sound-off segment.  Earlier, we asked you if you would want to see the video of Steve Irwin's death.  And a lot of you called in.  Here's what some of you had to say.  Listen.  Hello.  This is Martin from Queens, New York.  He would more than likely would like to have the video shown. 
[01:00:30]  That was just the life that he lived.  Hi, my name's Dan from Newburgh, New York.  I wouldn't mind seeing it only because this guy died doing something he loved in the spirit of his job.  I mean, he's very glad he was killed this way if Dan Bliss is getting in a car accident.  So let's â€“ there were â€“ the first two want to see the video.  Yeah, the first two want to see. 
[01:01:00]  And I'm not buying â€“ I've heard this since he died that he died doing something he loved.  That's â€“ wouldn't you rather die doing something you hate?  That way you don't have to continue doing it.  If you're doing something you love, you're having fun.  You want to continue doing it.  It's not like, you know, if you're in a crappy situation, then you want to get it over with.  Yeah, wouldn't it be easier?  Yeah.  You're doing something you truly hated.  You truly hated.  At least now you're out of it.  Like changing a diaper or something. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Like, all right, look, I know I'm dying, but look, I was doing something crappy anyway.  It's really a horrid thing I was up to, so at least I don't have to finish.  You make a really good point.  It's like, oh, he died doing something he loved.  Yeah, he loved it.  He wanted to finish.  Yeah, like the surfer that dies surfing, the shark ate him, or he drowned.  I'm sure he wanted to catch that other wave that was coming in.  I'm sure that's exactly what he was thinking as he's drowning.  Yeah.  Well, I'm dying, but at least I'm dying doing something I love.  Something I love, inhaling water.  Wonderful.  A bunch of horse ass. 
[01:02:00]  Can you imagine if I died?  It's something you love also right up until the spike goes into your chest.  Right.  You know?  And you're dying doing something I love.  Pulling a spike out of his chest and bleeding to death underwater, that wasn't something  he loved doing.  No.  It was way away from the loving part at that point.  He died right after doing something he loved.  He died probably doing the worst thing.  The most horrific thing ever in his life.  Right. 
[01:02:30]  You die doing something you love if you're in bed with a really hot chick.  Yeah.  And let's just say you're laying back and you really can't talk.  If she says, how are you?  And you go, oh, things are going really good.  And then she just shoots you in the head when you're not looking.  Right.  Yeah.  And you don't even know it's coming.  Not even a clue.  Not a clue.  Right.  Very good point, Anthony.  Very good.  Thank you.  I like the way these guys are trying to manipulate the news into showing it.  They're going, well, he died.  Dude, just be honest about why you want to see it.  I like to see it because I think it's great.  Voyeuristic.  Shocking.  They've shown the beheading videos on the internet. 
[01:03:00]  It's all over the place.  They have no problem showing the 9-11 thing.  9-11, people falling out of windows, jumping out of windows.  They've shown that.  We're up to five years now.  So, well, we got to bring back all the footage again.  When does it become a ride?  That is the ultimate.  When a disaster has become a ride like the Titanic slide, which I haven't seen in a while.  Have you?  No.  Has there been an outcry or something that we missed?  No, because the Titanic's not hot anymore. 
[01:03:30]  Ah, very good.  Okay.  It's not a hot topic anymore.  See?  You need a new disaster that's long enough ago.  The Titanic sinking was a horrific thing.  Back in the day.  Killed a lot of people.  Back in the day, it was the most horrific thing you could think of happening.  And then fast forward.  Well, there's a few others, but.  Fast forward.  Daughter coming home with someone not white?  Yeah, well.  Well, it's the turn of the century.  Well, a little past the turn of the century, but.  You got this big slide that kids are climbing on at parties that is like the Titanic sinking, 
[01:04:00]  and they get to slide down it and bounce off of the smokestacks and stuff,  and there's water going down the deck, and it was a horrific disaster.  Yeah, if you bring back the people that died on the Titanic, they would be not pleased.  I don't think they would enjoy that it turned into a kiddie ride.  And how many years have to go by before, you know, there's a World Trade Center ride or any other disaster.  It's, you know.  That one's going to take a while.  It's there, but it's happened in the past.  That will take a while. 
[01:04:30]  I think at some point that will happen.  I think the Edmund Fitzgerald ride is next.  You think so?  Yeah.  Well, you're bored to death by a song that doesn't end.  All right, so this is what I'm getting at.  They're doing this sound off.  The first two people that called in want to see the death video.  Let's guess what this person's going to say.  Oh, no.  You got it.  We haven't heard it yet, but I guarantee this person's going to say absolutely no, I do not want to see it.  Got to balance it out.  Firm balance, sir.  The news guy, they have to balance out everything. 
[01:05:00]  Balance it out, sir.  All right, get two that are for it and two against it.  Get car accident, let's see.  My name is Ronaldo.  I'm calling from Queens.  No, actually, I do not think that they should release the video.  Wait, what a surprise.  Of Mr. Crocodile Dundee.  You know, that should be something.  Oh, my God.  He didn't just say that.  He did.  Danny was waiting, waiting for us to hear that.  He knew it was in there.  Crocodile Dundee.  Mr. Crocodile Dundee.  This jackass, jackass foreigner doesn't even know who the hell it is. 
[01:05:30]  What about the news?  They're a bunch of jackasses.  I'm sure they got more than four people calling their stupid phone there.  They knew that was funny.  That's why.  They knew it was funny, and they left it in.  And I like that caller, by the way, because that's how we should all feel about this idiot.  You know who knows who it is.  The crocodile guy, Paul Hogan, whoever died, none of us should really know who he is.  Paul Hogan died?  Exactly.  I love this caller.  Look at E-Rock's crying.  No, he didn't.  No, we're just saying that, Eric. 
[01:06:00]  Eric, Eric, get him a tissue.  Come on, you little hulkster in heaven.  I can't wait until Eric's a hulkster in heaven.  Crocodile Dundee.  You know, that should be something between his family to see, not everybody in the world  to see.  It's just personal.  Yeah, a whole movie.  Some of your e-mails and voicemail responses to tonight's sound-off question.  Now, here's Nick with a look at your full forecast.  There you go.  Enough about him dying.  What's the forecast?  Well, light showers with a chance of a spike through your heart. 
[01:06:30]  Just kidding.  All right.  I liked Steve Irwin.  I thought his show was fun enough already.  He's like, he's this important guy.  Yeah.  It's because he was well-known.  That's all.  Pussled with animals.  Once you're well-known, people seem to get a little touchy about when you drop dead.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, we'll do the news teases, okay?  Don't forget, we're broadcasting live from WYSP this Friday. 
[01:07:00]  The ONA Traveling Virus coming to Philly.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  All the info is up on OpianAnthony.com.  We've got 10 comedians.  But right now, if you're the 94th person to text VIRUS to WYSP1, that's 99771,  you'll score a pair of tickets to see the Opian Anthony Traveling Virus this Saturday,  September 9th at the Tweeter Center.  Once again, text VIRUS to WYSP1, and you'll get a pair of tickets if you're the 94th person 
[01:07:30]  that does that, okay?  Ooh.  It's the ONA Virus spreading across America.  Yeah.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I got to go now.  Introducing the Opian Anthony wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME05.  That's 866-WOWME05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  That's Opian Anthony. 
[01:08:00]  Opian Anthony.  The Opian Anthony Show.  Let's get into some news teases.  We love the news teases.  The scary news teases.  That's what the news is for these days.  Not to inform.  To scare you.  And we can use your help around America.  We get some great ones here in New York, but your local news is doing the same thing. 
[01:08:30]  Yep.  For the most part, the ones we play are mostly from New York.  We really want to hear the scary news teases from all over the place.  Even the people listening to us on XM Canada.  Hey, welcome.  I don't know if the Canadian news scares you, though.  I don't know if they're into that.  Nah.  They're into, like, talking about health care and stuff on the news.  That's all we know about your country, by the way.  I learned that from a Michael Moore movie.  Canadians. 
[01:09:00]  That's all we know.  You're a lot nicer.  Hey, they have health care for everybody.  What else do you know about Canada?  I don't know.  Give me a fact.  They actually try to get things done with their news.  Do they?  They try to actually inform you and make things better.  Here in America, it's all about scaring the bejesus out of you.  But everything's got to be scary.  Right.  Well, before we...  It's a pretty scary story this morning.  Besides my stupid home invasions in my neighborhood, there seems to be, also in my county, these criminals 
[01:09:30]  that are running around threatening people with hypodermic needles that they say is full of heroin.  And if you don't give them money, they will inject you.  But, like, wouldn't they just use the heroin?  Yeah, isn't that why they're robbing you?  Probably.  To get the hair on?  But I'm sure you don't want to be poked with that needle anyway.  That's BS.  I'm more worried about the ticks in the bag story than we don't know what's going on with Dad yet.  Tennis stadium after you. 
[01:10:00]  Here's a cigarette.  I'll make you smoke it.  Hey, easy.  It's bad.  Do we know what's going on with the ticks in the bag?  No, I saw ticks in a bag on the news, and that scared me enough.  Now the news teases.  It doesn't even have to have the sound on.  No.  It just scared me.  I saw someone handling a bag full of ticks, and I was frightened.  A bag full of ticks?  Ticks.  You open up the twitchels.  All right.  Before we play the latest batch of news teases, why don't we go back to the Hall of Fame?  Ah, yes.  Because this is the end game.  We're trying to build a news tease Hall of Fame. 
[01:10:30]  Yes, the ones that are so completely ridiculous that they earn a spot in the Hall of Fame.  They try to scare you, but you have to laugh because it's so out there.  I mean, everybody's heard the one about, you know, your child playing with a toy that could kill him.  We'll tell you what it is at 11.  You're like, but my kid's playing with toys now.  Yeah.  Maybe the toy you're mentioning is he's playing with it and choking as we speak.  You know, those are your basic frightening teases that we play. 
[01:11:00]  But some go above and beyond the scare tactic into the realm of ridiculous.  And they make our Hall of Fame.  Yeah, Hall of Fame.  Like this one.  Are you normal?  Thursday at 11 on News 8.  Yeah, that is so ridiculous that it has to be in the Hall of Fame.  It's so quick and it's so vague. 
[01:11:30]  Are you normal?  Well, we've learned.  In what?  They've tried to make it as vague as possible to get as many people to watch.  The second you start giving details.  Who's brave enough to actually say, I'm normal.  I don't have to watch that.  You can sit there and go, well, maybe I'm not.  Maybe I'm not normal.  The more vague you keep it.  I do pick my nose.  You're right.  The more vague they keep it, the more people have to watch.  You start focusing in on what the problem is.  Every detail you give, you're eliminating more listeners. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  Or viewers.  Do you breathe?  You're in danger.  I think I breathe.  Here's another one that made the News Tease Hall of Fame.  Could frequent hiccups be a sign of cancer?  Watch News 8 to 10.  All right.  Again, Hall of Fame because everyone has gotten the hiccups.  And sometimes you do go through phases where you get them kind of frequently.  Oh, my God, it's cancer. 
[01:12:30]  That's what you're going to think.  That's what they want you to think.  Now you're going to tune in and say, okay, give me a few more details so I know if I'm hiccuping whether I have cancer.  Frightening.  So that was a Hall of Famer.  And here's the next News Tease Hall of Fame entry.  How a twist on the predator law could shut down religion.  Shut it down.  Shut down.  Not your religion.  Not a religion. 
[01:13:00]  Religion.  Religion.  Everywhere.  Everything from Catholicism, Buddhism, the savage Muslims, everything.  Everything.  Shut it down, though.  Shut down religion.  How does that happen?  I don't know.  We don't care.  And then finally, this one made the News Tease Hall of Fame.  Still my favorite to this day.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house. 
[01:13:30]  That has it all.  I've heard that probably a hundred times.  Can't get enough of it.  That has it all.  It's fear.  It's ridiculous.  It could not possibly happen.  It's kids.  It involves children, which is a big thing on the News Teasers.  That probably is a, that's one of the gold entries into the Hall of Fame.  That's like, what would you compare that to in like the Baseball Hall of Fame?  Oh, that's like the Babe Ruth right there.  That's Babe Ruth.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I don't acknowledge the black ballplayers in the Hall of Fame.  Jesus.  All right.  Appropriate bell action.  Wow.  Did he say that so straight-faced?  That's what the asterisk is for.  It's before they ruined everything.  Hell, if the blacks aren't going to acknowledge Babe Ruth, then I don't acknowledge black ballplayers.  Attaboy, Ope.  Thank you.  Someone has to speak out.  Oh, there's some courageous people in the Negro Leagues.  All those years we tried to get in the play and they refused.  Finally, Jackie Robinson agreed to a contract home. 
[01:14:30]  Is that how that happened?  It certainly is.  I heard different stories.  We're like, come on, just be a part of things, would you?  All right.  Well, here we go.  The latest scary news teases.  Stingrays.  Are they hurting your kids?  All right.  Are they?  Hopefully.  How stingrays could shut down religion.  They're going to pack stingrays into a three-block area.  Do they? 
[01:15:00]  Problem is, it could be in the Yates tub.  That could have saved us some time.  Five little stingrays.  Drop them in the bathtub.  Well, we all enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, just about all of us.  Oh, boy.  I do.  Here's the latest scary news teases.  Very common item in the scary news teases.  Usually pops up.  Well, because everyone's drinking it.  Yeah.  Just about everyone.  And a health warning, if you drink coffee, how just one cup can trigger a heart attack. 
[01:15:30]  Who's most at risk?  Jesus.  All right.  Now, everyone that drinks coffee has to, because now, are you at risk?  The only detail they gave right there is that you drink coffee.  And it could be as little as one cup.  One cup, yeah.  One cup of coffee.  One cup.  Okay.  There's the details.  You drink one cup, you might get a heart attack.  Now, you tune in, and obviously, it's probably people with high blood pressure. 
[01:16:00]  Maybe fat people.  Do you remember, Danny?  Yeah, it had something to do with it.  It was a certain type of medication.  Oh, wow.  Why did they say that?  Because then people would go, I'm not on any kind of medication.  I don't have to watch.  Why'd they say if you take so-and-so and you drink coffee, it could be a risk for a heart attack?  That would make sense.  Because this is all about getting viewership up.  That's all.  They don't give a crap about us.  I have coffee every morning.  That frightened me. 
[01:16:30]  But you don't take so-and-so.  Does that make me?  Take so-and-so.  Does that make the Hall of Fame?  No.  I don't think that makes the Hall of Fame.  It's a good one.  It's a good one.  It doesn't make the Hall of Fame.  Okay.  Well, a lot of us have laptops, don't we?  Yes.  I have a MacBook.  Oh, boy.  I have a few of them around the house.  I have a laptop.  Everyone has a laptop, pretty much.  Yeah.  These days, well, we're not safe from our laptops.  Laptops catching fire, even exploding. 
[01:17:00]  It is documented.  It has happened to people.  Find out if you have to worry about your computer.  Are you...  Computer week on the Discovery Channel.  When computers attack.  All right.  Let me just...  I think your stories on laptops exploding are ridiculous. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  And scene.  We're not safe from laptops.  Does that make the Hall of Fame?  Exploding laptop.  Pretty ridiculous, but no.  What happened with your computer?  Every time I hit the escape button, a big fifth would come out and just hit the... 
[01:18:00]  You know, as a goof, like one of these computer makers, they should trigger it, so if you type in LOL, your computer explodes.  It should.  Well, like, yeah, every time you type in...  R-O-T-L-O.  Yeah, if you put, like, one of those little abbreviations, a little hole in your computer, and AIDS just squirts out at you.  Like a clown, like a funny clown flower.  AIDS squirting out of your laptop? 
[01:18:30]  Don't type in LOL.  All right, here's the next scary news tease.  Oh, what's up with the exploring laptops?  Do you have an answer to that, Danny?  Yeah, that was some Dell.  A certain model of Dell came with a certain battery.  Yeah.  It was recalled.  Is that what it was?  Oh, the battery recalled?  Yeah, it was a battery.  When you get a hold of the Indian people on the phone for customer service, you throw it against the wall, and it sounds like an explosion.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  I had to check the serial numbers on my Dell, and they were fine. 
[01:19:00]  Mine gets really hot, though.  A lot of times, with your laptop, you just close it, and then you put it in your case, and you travel.  I have a Dell laptop.  That is what I've always had, and it's, like, really hot once in a while, which means...  Wait, is it still running?  You're, like, having it in sleepy mode, and you put it in your bag?  Sure.  Why not just shut it off?  Don't yell at me.  Because what are you doing?  Taking it on airplanes?  Yeah, but then I'll open it sometimes, and it's, uh, I don't know why I do it.  I'm just in a rush.  I'm busy.  That annoys me that you're putting a, like, a laptop that isn't shut off in your carry-on bag, and then do you put it in the overhead bin? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  And then...  I wrap it in a blanket.  And then you wait until takeoff.  So, theoretically, a battery can catch fire in that overhead bin in between the time you're allowed to use it and not allowed to use it.  But it's not supposed to, though.  A lot of times I don't even take it out.  Of course, it's not supposed to.  Planes are never supposed to crash, either.  Well, I mean, like, you're supposed to be able to do that.  You're supposed to be able to just close your thing, and it just shuts down. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, but it goes into, like, sleepy mode.  I like...  But it's still kind of going.  My computer's...  I actually make people whisper.  There are laptops on a plane!  Laptops on a plane!  Exploding laptops!  Wait, speaking of noise...  On a mother-error plane!  Did Eric tell...  Oh, wait, maybe we can do that story later.  All right, he had a really good story about an airplane and what happened on his plane.  All right, cool.  We'll do it after the break.  Please, it's a gem.  Iraq, practice your story in front of him. 
[01:20:30]  Did he have to wear a little wristband that he's a child traveling alone because he was wearing that shirt?  What?  They brought him applesauce.  He's like, but I'm 26!  They give him a little blanket and tell him, don't worry, the flight attendants will take care of you.  That stupid hat and a pair of knickers.  Did they invite you to the cockpit to get your wings?  Yeah.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Here's the next scary news tease.  Prescription drugs.  Uh-oh.  Coming up, a warning inside your medicine cabinet. 
[01:21:00]  How to tell if your prescription drugs are putting your health at risk.  Any of them.  I wish they would say that your prescription drugs could bite you.  But people would be like, they can.  I'll have to tune in.  Babysitting in Viagra?  An unpleasant connection?  Danny, we got an answer to that one.  Yeah, that's from all the spam you get about some online pharmacies.  They're saying that some of those prescriptions, if you buy them, may not be legit. 
[01:21:30]  Wow, go figure that one out.  If you're buying it online.  I heard in Canada, isn't there a way, like, a really legitimate one in Canada to use, like, an online?  There's a couple of them that are, like, big and legitimate to get your spam.  There probably was once, but now that's, like, the headline of every spam I've gotten in the last time.  Okay, way to humiliate me.  Yeah, let's go to Nathan in West Palm Beach.  Nathan.  Hey.  Hey, Nathan.  What's going on, Dad?  Where's all these news teasers coming from?  The same station?  Fox News?  Yes.  Because they got the same whole voice. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, the Fox News here in New York City is notorious for this.  That's why we need your help around America.  Danny, what's the email address?  Danny at foundrymusic.com.  Is there a link on opiananthony.com, too, for this?  If not, there will be.  Get one up there immediately.  Because we want news teasers from across America and from Canada, if that's possible.  Hey, Nathan, you're from West Palm, right?  Yeah.  Now, you've watched the news.  Do you see these teasers down there? 
[01:22:30]  Oh, yeah, and it's always the whole that tells them.  Yep.  It's always the whole.  See, we're looking for that.  So, if you see one, send it in.  Send it in.  All right.  All right, thank you.  Just DVR the news or something, or show before the news.  All right, it's Danny at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Well, we all work, so this next scary news tease could be a doozy.  Oh, no.  We all work?  We all work?  Okay.  All right. 
[01:23:00]  That's all you need to know before this.  That's all you need to know.  Eric, relax.  Before this scary news tease.  Yeah, Eric, you could take a break.  You're safe.  You're going to live to 100.  Oh, my God.  See what happens when you take a day off while the rest of us work.  That's right.  Gallivanting around Florida, were you?  All right, here we go.  Are you working too hard?  How you could be risking your life just by working a few extra hours a week. 
[01:23:30]  Great.  A few extra hours a week.  Not even every day.  Poor guy is just trying to pay for college for his kid.  That's all.  Now he has to worry about dropping dead of a heart attack because he put in a couple extra hours.  Is that what it is?  How do you know?  It has to be like a stroke or a heart attack.  What else could it be?  Danny?  One of the points from that one was high blood pressure.  If you have high blood pressure and you're stressed out, you work too much, all your blood pressure goes up, all that stuff. 
[01:24:00]  Kelly from Boston on the Instant Feedback.  News alert.  Exploding laptops can attack through the bottom of a kayak.  News at 11.  Take your laptop in your kayak.  That is trouble.  I want to put a stingray in my laptop box.  Uh-oh.  Why didn't we do the Celine Dion during that kayak story?  We could have.  We missed an opportunity.  Look at that.  Damn it.  Here's the next scary news tease.  So far, none of these will make the Hall of Fame.  No.  No.  But a good batch.  Just a good batch of news teases. 
[01:24:30]  Teens turning a common medication into a dangerous drug.  Tonight at 10, the ABC 15 investigators go undercover to expose the over-the-counter medicine quickly becoming teens' legal drug of choice.  It came up really fast and then everyone was doing it.  See how easy it is for them to get it.  Plus, a Valley teen talks about her frightening experience.  And one of the pupils was completely dialing and I thought, oh, dear God, this is it.  An investigation every parent and teen should see.  Tonight on ABC 15 News at 10. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  How long was that?  30 seconds.  Now, how long does it say teenagers are using aspirin as a drug?  Yeah.  Why do they have to just ramble and babble?  With the dramatic music behind it.  Did you hear the...  I'm going with...  NyQuil.  Yeah, I was going to go with cold medication.  Or some type of...  Yes, it is some type of cold medication.  Got to be.  It's got something to do with methamphetamines, I think, because there's some... 
[01:25:30]  One of these drugs, like contact or whatever, you can use to make meth or something.  So they pull them off the shelves now.  You can't even buy them.  You have to go up to the counter and ask for it.  Maybe it's not meth.  It's something, though.  It's like something they can get high with.  Danny, do you know?  Yeah, this is just drinking too much cough medicine.  Oh, okay.  Cough medicine?  That is an age-old story.  Like Robitocin.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-a-dang-dang.  They were playing that kind of music when that story came out.  Allergy medications, like Benadryl. 
[01:26:00]  Like Benadryl.  You ever take cold medication, you get a little buzz, and it's kind of cool?  Mm-hmm.  It's like, oh, my nose cleared up.  I got a little buzz.  This is nice.  That's a nice story.  I want to hear the horror tales.  I don't know what happened.  I had a cough.  I drank some NyQuil, and I woke up.  She was 350.  And finally, the last news tease for today.  Oh, damn it.  We're going back to laptops, people.  Uh-oh.  We got a double.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:26:30]  Another laptop story?  Yeah, we got a double here, though.  This is a double.  Radiation?  This is a double scary news tease.  Very popular.  Okay.  Coming up, clearing the air on air fresheners.  Could they be harming your health, historian?  Of course they can.  Of course they can.  Of course they can.  Are those those little ones that go, pfft, pfft, every 30 seconds or so, or three minutes?  Don't tell me they're going to take our Christmas trees away from us.  I know what it is.  What?  Like the Glade or whatever, plug-in ones that they say can cause a fire. 
[01:27:00]  Anything they put in can cause a fire someday.  We'll guess.  Well, let's get the whole, uh, we'll do this, uh, whatever.  Let's play the whole thing.  Coming up, clearing the air on air fresheners.  Could they be harming your health, historian, house call?  Plus terror, minus the terrorists.  What's inside your laptop that couldn't bring a plane down?  All right, that has to be what I was saying.  I just did a scary news tease to Jimmy talking about the, the battery catching on fire.  Terror, minus the terrorists. 
[01:27:30]  Without, minus the terrorists is nothing.  It's not terrorism then.  No.  It's, it's a bit, it's a scary movie.  It's an accident.  It's snakes on a plane.  Who, which, is that New York?  I recognize that voice.  Yeah, that's, that's Fox.  He's at this Ernie Nastus, right?  Yes, it is.  Ernie Nastus stinks.  He's, he's a boob.  Really is this dumb Frankie Valli hairdo.  My hair and football helmets from 1920, a resemblance.  Like to eat boogers and then spit them on him. 
[01:28:00]  Ernie Nastus is a crud.  It doesn't work for CBS, I take it.  No.  That's right.  We won't have the likes of him.  We love CBS.  We certainly do.  Hey, uh, Danny, what's the answers here?  We got a double news tease there.  To be perfectly honest with you, that air freshener one was so ridiculous, I didn't even bother to take a look at it.  Ah, good.  But the, uh, the, uh, airplane story is exactly what Ant was saying, how these exploding batteries could pose a problem on aircraft.  Has it happened?  No.  No.  No.  And shut up until it happens. 
[01:28:30]  If you see a smoke coming out of your overhead, uh, bin, uh, then I would attend to that immediately.  You put it out with a, they have a fire extinguisher.  What do you think they have, gas on a plane just in case?  You never want a fire in a plane at 35,000 feet.  I don't care what it is.  It'll go right out.  We have enough scary things around us.  Can you believe they used to trust people smoking in planes?  I know.  That is beyond me.  And I remember flying when people were smoking in the goddamn plane. 
[01:29:00]  Lucky Lindy.  Me and him, we were going across the Atlantic.  I never, I've never been on a smoking flight in my life.  Really?  No.  Never flew on a smoking flight.  It was when I was a kid.  I was, uh, being, you know, shipped back and forth from my mother to my father, back from California, back and forth.  And, uh, people would just sit there.  You come from a broken home.  Yeah.  Ha ha.  I know.  What, what can I say?  It's very sad growing up.  Get on the plane. 
[01:29:30]  I'd be crying because I was leaving mommy.  And then I'd get to daddy.  And, and then I'd, I'd cry when I had to leave daddy and go back to mommy.  Because daddy would take the money that mommy sent for airfare.  And trade in the ticket.  And buy us Greyhound bus fare.  And spend the rest on booze.  You took the bus back from California?  Oh my god.  At, at 15 and 16.  They, they arrested us when we got into New York because they thought we were hookers. 
[01:30:00]  They thought we were young hookers trying to make it in the big city.  Well, because you're wearing your stupid, uh, fur, the thing you were talking about.  I didn't have a fur coat on.  Oh, all right.  But they were like arresting runaway kids.  There was like a crackdown.  Oh, this was just, my father, unbelievable.  Had, uh, you know, my mother sent out, didn't send money because she knew my father would just spend the money.  Sent out the airline tickets.  She bought us airline tickets.  My father cashed them in and, and bought us Greyhound bus tickets. 
[01:30:30]  Handed us, I believe, uh, $100, uh, for both of us to get 3,000 miles on a bus with.  It takes about two weeks.  And, uh, me and Joe blew it all in Vegas on a slot machine because we figured we were almost out of money anyway by that point.  We figured we better just try to make our money.  So we were completely broke and, uh, we met this nice girl that was going to a Cheyenne and, uh, she wound up staying the whole ride with us and hanging out. 
[01:31:00]  She was really cool.  And thank God she did because when we got, uh, taken in, when we got off the bus, they wanted to get our luggage and go through it.  And my brother decided that was a perfect opportunity to bring back, like, I don't know, $5,000 worth of tie stick in his suitcase because it was so cheap in California.  So the guy asked, you know, get your luggage and, uh, sent my brother down, kept me there. 
[01:31:30]  My brother gave it to the girl, gave that bag to the girl and said, hold on to this.  I'll be back for it.  And she actually hung out and was back for it.  She was really cool.  Uh, the ride though, it was, there was an Uzo bum that was just completely drunk the whole time.  We kept stealing his Uzo and drinking it.  Uh, we were hammered.  My half of my head fell asleep for like a month because I was laying on the back of the seat. 
[01:32:00]  There's no way to rest on a Greyhound bus.  There's, there's a metal bar across the back and I fell asleep on it and it like pinched  the nerve in my neck and my, half my head was asleep for a month.  I thought I had a stroke.  I thought I had a stroke at 16 because my father cashed in the plane ticket.  I love stories.  Oh God.  That's a two day, three day bus trip.  Two day, three day.  Probably a week.  It was 10 days.  It was almost two weeks.  It was 10 days. 
[01:32:30]  10 days.  They stop everywhere, every little crap hole across the country.  They stop and they don't take a direct route.  Like they go down and then up and over and you know, we were stopping in places like Cheyenne  and, and whatever happened to having one of our guys take a Greyhound bus from New York  to LA.  I have no idea.  We should do that.  And get little call-ins and get call-ins every day.  Stop at those dopey spots.  Well, well, uh, you know, bring a pal talk camera.  Well, yeah, that's a good idea. 
[01:33:00]  So you can watch the ride the entire time.  You can watch his whole, uh, progress.  Won't be me.  Well, what we're thinking of doing is having a road trip for the, uh, the pests and the  village people from New York to Cleveland.  Village people.  Village people.  You mean the people from the village.  I want Sam to dress like an American Indian.  Yeah, you know, the petting booth, the petting zoo people and, uh, and the pest booth.  We're thinking of renting a van for them and they can have a road trip from New York to  Cleveland.  They can do their pal talk thing and.  That's not a bad idea. 
[01:33:30]  That's a good idea.  We should get a road trip to Cleveland.  Sure.  We should.  Yeah.  I would drive to Cleveland.  Well, you might have to because nobody wants to pay for the plot.  Yeah.  We'll get into that another day.  Drove to Cleveland last time we went to Cleveland.  I would drive to Cleveland.  That's going to make it into a big thing.  It's a 10 hour drive.  I understand that, but do it with the pests and stuff.  Why not?  I would do it in a second.  I say.  You escalate a shake down.  I say we get ourselves a convoy.  Could be cool.  We could, we should do a convoy to Cleveland. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  We'll have to drive to the airport.  Yeah.  Get on the plane and drive to the hotel.  I'll do it.  You're driven.  Hey, last time we had to go from Cleveland and then to Buffalo.  And I drove, I drove from New York to Cleveland to Buffalo and then back down to a New York  City.  Wow.  That was a long ass drive.  Look, let's, uh, let's go to Rob in Jersey.  We'll think about that.  Rob.  I will be taking an airplane.  Hey, Rob.  How you doing?  Oh, I was calling actually to give you credit.  You've been absolutely on fire this morning. 
[01:34:30]  Ooh.  From different times, I've laughed out loud.  Popular shock jock bursting into flames.  You mean me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You mean me?  Thank you, sir.  That's open.  Actually, I'm trying to stop, uh, drinking coffee in the morning so I don't stammer as  much.  Well, also, you don't want to, uh, have heart attacks.  That's right.  One cup is all it takes.  I'm dying, though.  I'm, I'm, uh, a coffee drinker like, like no one's business.  You say one cup isn't that bad.  So if you have a-  No, I have to at least have one cup. 
[01:35:00]  But, uh, you know, I, I used to drink like six to eight a day.  I'm down to like three to four and I want to like get down to like two.  Pushed me like-  Two.  That was me with beer.  Six to eight a day.  But I, uh, I notice I can't talk when I have too much coffee in me.  Start stammering like an ass.  It's a morning thing, too.  Hey, we got to take a break.  Uh, send us your 30 second or less production piece about the Opie and Anthony show and the  week of October 2nd, we will announce the best five entries.  What's this about, Ann?  We're giving away what?  It's just gonna be for the people that are friends of the show. 
[01:35:30]  Shut up, stupid.  You make a great piece of production or a really, an exceptionally lousy one that is so bad it's  funny.  There are ones that are really bad, but they're just bad.  And then there are ones that are bad, funny.  Make a production piece about the show.  Could be about Jimmy, Opie, me, all of us together.  Isn't that how we got the, uh, the annoying 30 seconds?  Yeah.  Do we have that?  The Mac contest.  That was the winner from the last time we did this.  Yep.  We're giving away a MacBook, correct?  Yes, we are.  How many?  How many?  We'll put a break with that.  How many?  How many MacBooks we, we, we've thrown out there to the people? 
[01:36:00]  Five hundred.  Five, no, there must be two zeros that didn't belong.  I have no idea.  Albeit it's just five.  Steve's putting up one hand.  Five grand prizes.  All right, five.  For the best production pieces.  So get on whatever pieces of garbage you have now and, uh, push them to their limit and,  uh, make some production pieces about this program.  Where's the 24-hour Mac store?  It is right there on 56th or 58th.  Damn it. 
[01:36:30]  59th.  Oh!  Yeah.  59?  I think I went in Soho as well.  And 5th.  Is it 24 hours?  24 hours.  You go down there.  No, no, no.  You play around with everything.  Isn't that at the Apple store up, uh, 5th Avenue?  There's a brand new one.  It's 5th and 59th.  Oh, 5th Avenue and 59th.  You might have to be the same one.  Yeah, we're talking about it.  It's underground, like.  Oh, very cool.  This is a big glass.  Head to the Apple store or apple.com to check it out.  But basically, we're looking for your 30-second or less production pieces about the Opie and  Anthony show.  And, uh, we'll pick the best five entries.  You send in your entries to 923freefm.com. 
[01:37:00]  923freefm.com by September 29th.  Okay?  Right.  All right, here is the winner of the last time we did this contest, or one of the five  winners.  Yeah.  That's not so annoying at all. 
[01:37:30]  That, wow.  I forgot how completely annoying that is.  How embarrassed that's me.  We don't play that enough when we go to break and stuff.  The guy just kind of took Jimmy doing that mic check that he does and just...  That was wonderful.  Okay.  I thought you were going to be helpful.  Layered it.  We're real late, so why don't we step aside for a little bit.

[01:39:00]  Certainly are.  It's a virus.  It's spreading across America.  Deal with it.  We got an E-Rock story, Jim?  We certainly do.  Yeah?  E-Rock told me a good story.  What, uh, when did you fly home?  Yesterday.  All right, get to the story without the boring details.  We're getting on the plane.  There's this kid screaming in the same one-pitched tone. 
[01:39:30]  And this is going on for almost half an hour.  Can you imitate the kid, please?  That's actually a good point.  Kid is going...  Like that the entire time.  Was he doing it longer than that?  For over half an hour.  No, no, no, but each, each, each, each, each, each, each version of it was how long?  At least a minute.  I mean, do it.  At least a minute?  Not do it for a minute, but do it.  Please.  Ah!  That was three seconds. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, that was...  Yeah.  Not even.  It was like two and a half.  We want to see how long you could do it.  And what, where, where...  There's no way the kid was doing it for a minute.  Where was the kid?  On the airplane.  Right.  Okay.  So, the kid is making the same noise.  When we get on the plane, he sits down with his parents.  And this is going on for about half an hour.  And then the plane starts taking off.  The kid is still making this noise.  What noise would that be?  Ah!  Could you do it for more than three? 
[01:40:30]  You don't have to do it for a minute.  Yeah, do it as long as your breath can, like, hold out.  It may hurt, but...  Take a deep breath.  Do it as long as you can.  Because we're not getting how annoying this is, to tell you the truth.  You've got to bring everyone into the story here.  Because that's not that bad.  All right.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  All right.  Anytime.  Deep breath.  And go.  Ah!  That was four seconds, parrot lungs.  Jesus.  How about you start jogging?  Wow.  How old are you? 
[01:41:00]  That was four seconds.  You're like, what, 27 years old, tops?  Oh, my God.  So a kid did that 15 times longer than you just did.  That was...  I like how it ended in a golf.  How about that sit-up?  Like, Grandpa.  That was air that's been in as long as 10 years.  Hopping out.  So what?  Yeah, it might have been a goof, though.  E-Rock, one more try.  Yeah, you get one more.  Let's try to beat four seconds on the, uh, imitating the baby screaming at the airport.  And use some breath control. 
[01:41:30]  Like, kind of hold it back from the diaphragm, deep breath, and let it go.  All right?  Okay.  Are you ready to try again?  Yeah.  And go.  Eight seconds, old man.  Look, he's taking swigs off of everything he's got to drink over there. 
[01:42:00]  God, why is that so goddamn funny?  We have audio of that, I hope.  Of course.  Eight hours a second.  That is going to be on our instant replays, please.  You want to get under the E-Rock page?  How about one more try at it?  What do you say?  One more try.  One more, because you know something?  That was your longest one yet.  Yeah, now you know what you're doing.  You're kind of learning. 
[01:42:30]  Right, right.  Every time you do it.  This will be the last one.  All right.  So really make it count.  Okay.  As long as you can, hold it.  Like, hold it.  Hold it.  Like, as long as you can, even though you feel like you're out of breath.  Yeah.  Keep going until the last possible second.  Big breath before you do it, too.  Here we go.  And go. 
[01:43:00]  Eyes off.  That's much better.  His face is all red.  Yeah.  That was about, I don't know, 11 seconds.  That's not bad.  We'll give you 11 seconds on that one.  All right.  It's not bad if you used to play Superman and you fell off a horse.  All right.  So the kid's doing this at the airport.  In the airplane, yeah.  Airplane, sorry.  So everybody sits down, gets ready.  The plane's about to take off.  And as the plane is taking off, the kid is still making this noise. 
[01:43:30]  Someone from behind me yells, could you shut the damn kid up?  The father turns around and yells, the kid has Down syndrome.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  How old was the kid?  So we all have to suffer because you have bad DNA?  Exactly.  He said, the kid, like, shut the kid up.  And the father says, the kid has Down syndrome. 
[01:44:00]  Has Down syndrome.  Oh, boy.  But again, when you're two, you don't have to be retarded to be annoying and awful.  Kids who are two would make that noise anyway.  True.  So the Down, here's what the father was doing.  He was trying to, like, emotionally one-up the guy on the plane because his dumb kid wouldn't  even shut up.  Yeah.  I mean, if the kid was 19 doing that, then the Down syndrome excuse is valid.  How old would you say the kid was?  About two years old.  About two.  Two with Down syndrome?  So that's just a kid.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  Because, you know, usually you hear, well, he's got the intelligence of a two-year-old.  At two, he's normal.  Yeah, what's he got at two?  He's just got a wacky haircut.  What two?  How does he get the intelligence of?  He's still ahead of the curve at two.  Yeah.  Big drop off at three, but I thought, yeah, I swear to you, I thought he meant he was  like maybe 10 even or 13, somewhere where you're trying to tell him the whole principle  of flight, and he's just freaking out.  Yeah, the doctors are the parents of the kid was two. 
[01:45:00]  The good news is he's way ahead of where he should be.  Really?  Bad news?  It never gets any better than this.  It's just the brakes are on.  Screeching halt, folks.  What did the guy yell when the father said he had Down syndrome?  There was just this silence.  Yeah.  But later on in the flight, people were getting up to walk by saying they were going to the  bathroom, but to get a look at the kid to see what he looked.  To make sure?  Yep.  Kid doesn't look like he's got it. 
[01:45:30]  Ugh.  Just a loud kid.  Whole flight?  Did he do it the whole flight?  Most of it.  He kept trying to, the father kept trying to put on some kids' DVDs, and they were giving  coloring books, and they were bringing him little toys and wings and things.  How much entertain stuff did he eat?  They have to take an x-ray.  You see Captain's wings, the vomit bag, the headphones.  He was eating a crayon.  What's he eating a crayon?  Of course they did. 
[01:46:00]  They should have brought him a bag of lead paint chips.  Here you go.  Snack on these, dumbbell.  What?  Dumbbell.  They can't help it, Jimmy.  You absolutely can't help it.  Come on, Jimmy.  You know, people out there are affected by what they're hearing.  Of course they are.  It's very sad, Jimmy.  But it does annoy the living crap out of you, that you're on a flight, and that stuff's 
[01:46:30]  going on.  Well, let's move right into a couple with Down Syndrome getting married.  We started this about two weeks ago.  We never finished.  I think we've got to play the first two clips over again, right?  This was from 2020 or 60 Minutes or Dateline, one of those type of shows.  I'm so ashamed of myself.  You should be.  They're going to take your Panasonic Plasma TV back for that. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, no.  That's right.  And still weigh less than that kid's head.  Right, Jimmy?  You were working your way out of it.  What are you doing?  You're back in the forest.  Your rec should have known when he got on the plane and it was short and yellow.  Your seat cushion is also a hockey helmet.  In the case of an emergency, your Pete Rose haircut will lower itself from the ceiling. 
[01:47:30]  All right, here we go.  Couple with Down Syndrome getting married.  We started this a couple weeks ago.  Let's try to get...  A slide will pop out.  Please don't attempt to eat it.  That's not a slide.  It's the kid's tongue. 
[01:48:00]  All right, here we go.  Couple with Down Syndrome.  Down...  Down doobie doobie.  Yeah.  Short yellow plane.  Well, here we go.  They get married.  Here's the first clip.  The world hasn't seen many marriages like the one that was prepared for Carrie Bergeron  and her fiancÃ©, Sujit Desai.  They would have two weddings, Hindu and Christian, so the plan went, and two magical celebrations. 
[01:48:30]  Magical.  But more importantly, they were bringing their families, a community, their religions, and  a cause along with them.  A cause that could have kept them apart.  I had a hole in my heart, jaundice, a big tongue, and a wobbly hat.  As I got older, I also realized that I'm a slow learner.  Carrie Bergeron is 29 years old, a young woman with Down Syndrome. 
[01:49:00]  Technically, it means she was born with an extra copy of a chromosome in her genetic makeup  that causes people with Down Syndrome to have learning disabilities that can be mild or severe.  Heart defects are common.  There are also physical symptoms, such as an enlarged tongue that can cause words to  sound slurred, and extra folds of skin under the eyes.  Okay, terrific.  No kidding.  Wow.  It could be loud on planes. 
[01:49:30]  How can you tell which one's the bride and which one's the groom?  I guess by the hairstyle.  I guess that's what I would do.  Same face, different hairdos.  I now pronounce you man and wife.  You may rub jelly on the face of the bride.  The priest has to keep stopping the ceremony to yell at the bride's father. 
[01:50:00]  Will you stop giving her away this fast?  It's not time yet.  He shows up a day away at the church.  Here, here, here, here.  It's the rehearsal.  He thinks he's done.  Here you go, here you go, here you go, here you go.  Come on, come on, come on.  Very proud, very proud, very proud.  God bless.  Carrie volunteers at a learning center.  She was very lonely there.  Despite being a slow learner, Carrie grew up to speak as an advocate for people with Down 
[01:50:30]  syndrome.  She earned a certificate as a teacher's assistant, and she works as a volunteer aide in this daycare  classroom at the new Discoveries Learning Center in New York.  But in her teens, she knew there was something missing, and so did her mother.  Not a chromosome.  When she was about 15, I really noticed the loneliness.  It was looming big time.  And I just could see when her sisters or her brother went off with friends, there was just 
[01:51:00]  a look in her eyes as if to say, I wish I could do that.  Yeah.  Very lonely.  That's sad.  But.  Bob Kelly's crying right now.  But then, but then the loneliness ended when some of the neighborhood boys found alcohol  and a mattress in the woods.  Are you nuts?  Are you nuts?  Oh my God, no. 
[01:51:30]  The local lacrosse team.  More on the loneliness.  I was very lonely because my friends, they don't have any special needs, and they can  do things that I couldn't do, like having a job, and sports, and also hanging out with  their girlfriends and girlfriends.  She sounds fine.  She sounds smarter than a lot of the broads I knew back when they were that old. 
[01:52:00]  I was very lonely.  I didn't have anyone.  I don't have anyone.  Like she's, she's not just like, da-ga-mabe, you know?  She's talking, what's she talking about, things she can't do.  Just the fact that she's actually articulate in saying what she can't do, she should be able  to do it.  She sounds more articulate than Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Maybe Rich should be checked. 
[01:52:30]  Special needs.  She's correct his English.  Sujit, also.  Island L's in Tortilla.  We get to hear from the groom now.  Sujit also has Downs Syndrome.  Took him a long time to learn the right words to express himself.  Life changed in unexpected ways when Carrie met this 25-year-old man.  He is Sujit Desai.  Holy crap.  Oh, boy.  Off someone's cell phone.  I need some feedback.  Yeah.  The guy has a Pete Rose cut. 
[01:53:00]  The girl has an Emo Phillips.  All right.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  Life changed in unexpected ways when Carrie met this 25-year-old man.  He is Sujit Desai, who also was born with Down Syndrome.  His parents both work as dentists in upstate New York.  It took a long time for Sujit, as a child, to learn the right words to express himself.  But his parents found that music helped stimulate him. 
[01:53:30]  And although he struggled, he learned and now plays six instruments.  None of them will.  Let's say hi to Mike.  Mike.  Come on, dude.  Stop it.  What happened?  Come on, cuz.  Stop it.  Stop mocking this to be unfortunate.  Really.  You know who should mock?  Comedians that suck.  Like the one standing there next to you.  The little troll.  What's the matter about him?  Danny, I know.  Why is this hitting you?  I can't stand.  Jim Norton.  I can't stand him. 
[01:54:00]  Why is this hitting you on a bad level, sir?  Huh?  Why is this bothering you?  Do you have a waterhead at home?  That is...  Why?  Why don't you...  What's bothering you about this?  Let's tell the truth.  First of all, don't mock my family.  Come down here.  I'll twist your fucking neck off.  Oh, hey.  Oh, ho, ho.  Why is this bothering you?  Hey, tough guy.  Why is this bothering you?  You guys look like two little trolls.  I'll come down here and...  That's right.  Wait a minute.  Do it, Jim Norton, you pussies.  Why is this bothering you?  Yeah, what's the matter?  Tough guy. 
[01:54:30]  Don't mock me.  Don't say my family.  Come down here.  I'll kill you.  Why is this bothering you?  Oh, a death threat.  Cool.  I could get a New York State pistol license.  Finally.  Thank you, sir.  I needed a death threat.  Now, listen.  Why is this bothering you?  Mike, we're allowing you to speak, but you've got to say something of relevance.  Why does this bother you?  Why?  Yes.  Because Jimmy Norton's going to be appearing.  Why does this bother you?  Does it bother you because it hits too close to home?  Because that's what happens with comedy.  No, comedy.  This isn't comedy. 
[01:55:00]  Why does this bother you?  It's comedy to some people out there.  Hey, you know who's not a comic?  Jim Norton.  He sucks.  We got that.  Why does this bother you?  I'm going to rip his little troll fucking head off.  Yeah, you do that.  Why does this bother you, sweetie?  And he hangs up.  No answer.  He hangs up.  It bothers me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  It hits close to home.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Anything else is okay to make fun of, but if it hits close to where he is emotionally,  stay away.  I bet Mike laughs his ass off at the black jokes. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, I'm sure he does.  Or the Asian jokes.  Don't make fun of the unfortunate.  Or when we go into the moronic Italian show on Sirius.  That whole thing.  I bet, oh, he laughs at that the second we hit on something a little too close to home.  Hey, my family.  You shouldn't have done so much LSD when you were a kid.  Maybe you'd have a kid that could think.  He didn't say it was his family.  Oh, I bet it was.  I know it was. 
[01:56:00]  I know it was.  He's got to look at that disaster every day and know it's his fault.  It's your fault, Mike.  Keep listening.  You listening?  Your fault.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Your fault.  You smoked that joint before you had sex, didn't you?  We were just trying to have some fun.  Joint to it?  I don't know.  We were just trying to have some fun.  I don't feel too good about myself right now.  I'm feeling great about myself.  I have a problem that Dateline or 2020 did this piece. 
[01:56:30]  Of course.  Because it's the modern-day freak show.  That's why people are watching two people with Down syndrome get married.  The girl sounds fine.  They're not feeling for anyone on the TV.  Maybe there's a small percent of the people watching, of course.  But most of us would watch this because we're like, oh, my God, I've never seen anything like this before.  You ever talk to a stripper?  I swear.  And I'm not.  This is no joke.  We've got to take a break.  So.  That girl, the retarded married girl, sounds more intelligent than any, any stripper I've ever talked to. 
[01:57:00]  There you go.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Mike sucks.  Mike brought us all down.  Mike's an ass.  He's a douche calling a radio show complaining.  Complaining.  And they won't admit why he bothers them.  What's the matter?  I'm pissed he didn't think my insults were any, were worse than yours.  He didn't like it.  Why does it bother you?  Don't come down here.  Bye.  Why not just admit why it bothers you? 
[01:57:30]  He's going to twist your neck off, he said.  Who cares?  Just put me on my knee.  Good luck.  You'd be doing me a favor, stupid.  He doesn't have a neck, idiot.  Exactly, good luck finding the chin.  You're going to twist me, it'll be my arms.  I'll go, wrong area, fella.  We're trolls.  Hey, don't make fun of my appearance.  All right, with that.  I hate everyone, including you, Mike.  Mike's back, but we have to.  Of course it is.  Is it, Mike?  Why don't you just tell us why it bugs you, Mike?  Mike. 
[01:58:00]  Yo.  Don't hang up.  I think I got disconnected.  Oh, you hung up.  All right, you hung up.  So why does this bother you?  Why?  I'm not going to admit why it bothers you.  Why?  My son's not a disaster.  Who are you to call my son a disaster?  We don't know anything about you, Mike.  We're just assuming stuff.  If you're not going to say, I'm going to speculate.  This is what happens when you do the type of radio show we do.  When something hits too close to home, you get very, very offended, but you have no  problem laughing at all the other crazy stuff we do.  I don't laugh at you. 
[01:58:30]  No, you're not understanding my point, though, really.  If you had, if Jim Norton, look at Jim Norton's poor mother and father, what they got to go  through.  Exactly.  They have a successful son.  The bottom line is this.  I asked you why it bothered you, and what's the problem with it?  Well, no, it doesn't hit close to home.  It's not, you know, it kind of does, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Well, I'm sorry for that.  Well, what about all the other things that we make fun of?  Like the things that have wrecked my life and AIDS, which has affected everyone.  Why is that okay? 
[01:59:00]  But something that hits close to home?  Jim Norton's life is an open book on this show.  He beats himself up more than he beats others up.  Yeah, I know, but just turn around and say someone's son is a disaster.  With my four, I smoke too much pot.  What are you kidding me?  I didn't say that.  There was a little anger in the room.  I thought you were so upset you tuned away.  Yeah, yeah, I thought you were so upset.  Why were you listening?  I work in the city.  I drive my truck right in front of the station.  I'll come up and talk to you about it right now.  You got a little troll that tells me I'm a tough guy? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, I am a tough guy.  Why don't you, first of all, you have a problem with me.  Keep your problem pointed at me, but stop blaming me for everything that everybody says  on the show.  If you're going to just hate you, you talk like a little troll.  You see, stop trying to be funny, Mike.  Mike, stop trying.  I don't care if you like me.  Drive your truck drunk into a wall.  I don't care if you like me or not.  I'm talking to Jim Norton.  I know.  I am Jim Norton, you jackass.  Oh, my God.  You are stupid, Mike. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, Jimmy, stop it.  You little troll, you.  That was Anthony.  That was Anthony.  All right, Mike, we got to go.  All right, guys.  Is it okay if we make fun of the blacks next?  Yeah, screw you.  You would have fun with that, right, listening to that?  I got a black, you know, whatever.  I know.  A black what?  What would you like us to make fun of?  Seriously.  What would Mike like us to make fun of?  Some of the towel heads and stuff, you know.  We do enough of that.  All we do is trash them.  You know, and there's some nice towel heads out there.  And then we're going to have to take phone calls from them. 
[02:00:30]  Now you're pushing it.  That's one or two.  I understand your point, but just maybe a little pissed off.  All right, Mike, we'll move on soon.  Go listen to Z100 or something for a few minutes.  We'll be done with this soon.  You have to come here and smack in your head.  How's that?  It doesn't matter, man.  You can do that.  It would be very hard to throw your beating.  You know something?  Let me tell you something, Mike.  Let me tell you something, Mike.  Keep up the act that you're coming down to kick our ass.  And you know what's going to happen?  You're going to get your ass beat and thrown in jail.  That's all that's going to happen. 
[02:01:00]  That's all that's going to happen.  I'm just being honest with you.  That's what's going to happen.  Pussies, pussies, pussies.  Three little five foot nothing pussies.  Goodbye.  And he hangs up.  And then he hangs up again.  There he goes.  I didn't say that, Mike.  No one hung up on you.  I didn't say that, Mike.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  I love showing my introverted fat guys to whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  That's right. 
[02:01:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Let's go right to the phones.  Ken in Ohio.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Ken.  Hey, I was laughing so hard.  I don't know who actually made the call, but you hit the nail right on the head.  I have a son nine years old.  It has down.  But, you know, all the funny stuff you guys do, you got to laugh.  I mean, I'm sure if my wife's listening when I get home, I'll get my butt kicked.  But it is.  It's funny.  I mean, stuff happens.  Crap happens.  You can't change it, but you can't laugh about it. 
[02:02:00]  What are you going to do?  We all have our crosses.  All right.  Well, the key is with cringe humor, it's like anything awful hurts somebody.  It's like if you draw the line with comedy, like as a general subject, then there's really  nothing you can make fun of.  Even drunk driving is a safe thing.  Like, I was drinking.  I got pulled.  But, you know, is drunk driving funny when you break it down?  No, it's awful.  No.  We try to make fun of everything.  We try.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And there's some stuff, like I said, it doesn't harm, bothers some people, but you're going to laugh  with some stuff, other stuff, the Ilecto, other stuff.  I mean, don't get pissed off. 
[02:02:30]  People, people.  We had a really pissed off woman from Philly, but she hung up.  Oh.  I hope she calls back.  The reason that I'll do stuff like that is because the things that hurt me on a personal  level, like that I find really personally very sad or hurt, but look, I make fun of  them too.  Yeah, you have to.  Keep my own stuff safe.  Exactly.  I love to know.  You guys aren't afraid to hit anything, you know?  That's life.  You deal with it.  Even stuff that, yeah, affects us personally.  The thing is, I think all of us in this room really enjoy dark humor.  Yeah.  There's that gallows humor that all of us enjoy, and it's twisted. 
[02:03:00]  But we hit, you know, all the subjects.  We hit all the bad, like nasty, despicable subjects, and find some kind of a sick joke  in there.  A twist on it.  You know, you've got to have some humor or something.  I mean, if you can't laugh at it, then, you know, I mean, there's nothing else out there.  You've got to have something to relax.  All right.  Can we get your point?  Thank you so much. 
[02:03:30]  Dancing is fast.  Let's get back to the funny.  Donnie in Boston.  Yeah, I'm just wondering if that fine young couple registered at Toys R Us.  Oh, my God.  And with that, we go back to the clips because we're running out of show here.  Which one are we going to play?  We didn't hear the guy, the groom.  All right.  Yeah.  We didn't hear him yet.  We didn't hear Sujit, also has Down syndrome, took him a long time.  No, we heard about him.  We didn't hear him.  Took him a long time to learn the right words to express himself.  Yeah.  We played that, right? 
[02:04:00]  We didn't hear him talk, though.  Did we play that?  We heard that clip.  We heard that clip.  All right.  Let's move on here.  Sujit met Carrie at a Down syndrome convention.  Oh, my God.  That must have been a treat to accidentally book a room with that.  No sleep that night.  Sujit has a special nickname for her.  And then whoever put this together for us, probably Danny.  It says, you may want to pause right before he says it to come up with your own nickname.  All right.  He also entertains at nursing homes and events for people with Down syndrome. 
[02:04:30]  And when he encountered Carrie Bergeron at a National Down Syndrome Congress in Pittsburgh, it was love at first sight.  I said to my parents, this is the girl that I really want to date and to have someone in my life.  Do you have a special name for her?  Do you see?  And this is what drives me nuts.  Like, a guy like Mike will get pissed off at us.  But do you see what that guy in the media just did?  Do you have a special name for her?  Knowing he's going to get something good. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  And he's doing it under the guise of being a concerned newsman when he's trying to get something screwed up.  If that was a regular couple, do you think he'd say, do you have a nickname for your wife?  No.  No.  But he knows this one is going to be a gem.  He's got a nickname.  A doozy.  He's got a Lulu.  By the way, do you know if that was him playing the piano?  No, that's actually what he hears in his head all day long.  Three minutes left.  Holy crap.  For her.  Actually, yes.  I call her Care Bear. 
[02:05:30]  And when he calls her Care Bear, I feel so different and so special.  I feel like someone really cares about me and wants to be with me right all day long.  It was either that or a tree, lady.  Care Bear.  Care Bear.  All right.  Want to move right on so we can maybe bring this up?  Yes.  On their own excursions, including trips in a rowboat on the lake behind the Desai's house, 
[02:06:00]  they were, in a very real sense, escaping into uncharted waters.  Sand in a rowboat.  It is rare for people with Down syndrome to marry.  The parents are there with a drill.  Pretending they were all the lights out.  Killing a hole in the bottom of it.  I won't tell if you don't.  They're scuba diving with a drill.  Down syndrome to marry.  Carey loved pretending they were on the Titanic the way it was in the movie. 
[02:06:30]  I'm so glad I'm with you, Jack.  I'm not going to leave you.  The question of children was settled by Carey's decision to undergo a surgical procedure to prevent conception.  Since the likelihood of having a Down syndrome child would be high,  and it would be virtually impossible for Carey and Sujeet to care for a child on their own.  Children is a big responsibility, and we just have to be responsible for ourselves, really. 
[02:07:00]  She shouldn't bring up the Titanic, because they had to make some tough choices on that boat.  Women and children first, water heads last.  Oh, my God.  Who is she kidding?  Exactly.  That's why the Titanic sank.  It was actually those two in a rowboat, and they hit one of their heads.  All right, we've got one more minute left here.  I think we can squeeze this in, hopefully.  For her first dance with Sujeet as husband and wife,  Carey wanted her sister Wendy to sing the theme from Titanic,  no doubt heard at thousands of weddings since it became such a standout. 
[02:07:30]  In a world where we often honor people with special needs  as inspirations for achievements beyond our expectations,  but may look away from issues such as loneliness,  this couple had their own interpretation of the words.  What does that song mean to you?  It means no matter where we are in life, 
[02:08:00]  we will never grow apart.  Oh, yeah?  This is her singing it.  Oh, no.  If you really love somebody, never, ever quit.  Oh, no.  Don't ever do that.  Why don't they go on with your education?  If you really love somebody, you will know.  Oh, God.  Whatever. 
[02:08:30]  That is inspiring.  That's the modern-day freak show right there.  They played her singing.  They showed a clip of her singing.  Yeah, yeah.  Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus,  the comedy event of 2006.  We only have two dates left this Saturday at the Tweeter Center in Camden, New Jersey,  broadcasting live from WYSP this Friday.  Hopefully, if you're in the area, you'll stop by and say hi to us.  Lots going on outside the studio.  Tickets on sale now through all Ticketmaster locations,  all the info on opieandanthony.com.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it. 
[02:09:00]  And that's how we end today, guys.  Thank you so much for checking us out.  If you're not joining us on XM, have a great day.  Have a great Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  Yes.  And we'll see you tomorrow.  Bye-bye.  Whip-A-Mount Wednesday is a wonderful pastime  embraced by Opie and Anthony fans all over the globe.  Some people, however, fail to see the joy in this time-honored tradition.  In the spirit of fairness, we offer them this platform  to voice their opinions to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:09:30]  Introducing Irate Keyboarding Person.  Dear Opie and Anthony,  why do you guys always have to talk about Whip-A-Mount Wednesday?  I don't want to see strange b****s.  The only b****s I want to see are the ones on my lovely bride, Eunice,  or the ones on my back.  I really need to see a doctor.  I think there's this.  If the thought of seeing naked b****s upsets you this much, 
[02:10:00]  we submit to you that there may be a larger issue you're not dealing with.  For more information on Whip-A-Mount Wednesday,  or to get a WOW sticker, visit opieandanthony.com.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  We're halfway to XM.  We started walking early today.  Damn it.  Not much going on on the walk.  We got like three guys,  the same guy we see every morning. 
[02:10:30]  Ugh.  And two other guys today.  I don't have a headset.  I can't hear anything.  Oh, that's okay, Jimmy.  Talk to this guy.  We'll talk loud.  Hi.  He's got gifts.  What do you got?  I got a...  Are we on the radio?  We're on the radio.  What do you got?  How are you doing?  I'm Sergeant.  Let's walk.  Oh, hi, Sergeant.  Oh, yeah, all right.  How are you doing?  Good.  Well...  Do you badmouth me on message boards?  Of course not.  Okay, good boy.  Hi.  We got one of each of the team shirts from the softball game.  Hold on.  Anthony, are you talking? 
[02:11:00]  I don't want to interrupt you guys.  I can't.  I don't have earphones on.  I was just saying hi.  Thanks to Danny.  Just completely hating me.  I make the fucking kid coffee.  Excuse me, miss.  This is important.  Okay, what do you got?  We got one of each of the team softball shirts.  Oh, nice.  FBA Paltox.  Very nice.  New York Pests.  Green light.  Do you have an XL?  Very nice.  Well, number 2XL.  My box got ransacked at the game.  They stole them all.  Yeah, this is 2XL. 
[02:11:30]  It's a little too big for me.  No one.  Who cares?  Oh, my God.  I know.  No one cares.  Who cares?  Wait.  You only bought two?  No one cares.  It's a goddamn shirt.  No one cares.  Enough about the shirts.  You bring two shirts for a whole show full of people.  A whole show full.  You guys wearing them is not that much, probably.  About 38, I'm wearing a Kiss shirt.  Believe me, I'd wear that.  One to none.  I got a new shipment coming, so one's definitely with your name.  I'm too fancy.  Thank you.  Maybe we can play musical chairs to find out who gets the shirts. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, how about that?  Yes.  Whoever loses has to wear one.  Two chairs, three guys.  A dildo on each one, so we all win.  We did dildo musical chairs.  I think we should play.  Yeah, we did.  We should do that again.  That was a fun game.  Dude, there's nothing going on today.  No, nothing.  Morning.  Morning.  Nothing.  Don't even acknowledge these people that walked with us today.  Just walk right in.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  Say screw them.  It's all right.  Teach them a lesson for not showing up today.  I say screw them.  Three people showed up today.  Don't wave.  No wave or nothing.  Just walk right in.  Say hi to the guy at the desk.  What?  Say hi to the guy at the desk.  I don't acknowledge him.  He doesn't exist to me.  I know.  Please someone throw the shows, Jesus.  Throw the shirts back at that guy.  Go ahead, Sam.  You understand? 
[02:13:00]  Are you crackling?  All right.  We never go this far into the dungeon.  Oh, boy, Will.  I know, Derek.  Waiting for a cue.  What's the cue?  What's the word?  I don't know.  All right.  If Jimmy goes in that elevator, I go in that one.  No.  I'm going to go in this one here.  Just keep broadcasting.  Let's see if it actually keeps going.  I hear me in your elevator. 
[02:13:30]  I hear him a little.  I'm caught in a thing and it's full.  Obi and Anthony.  XM 202.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it. 
[02:14:00]  Pedophile humor.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  Elvirus.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that bag.  Tim Norton.  I want Ozzy. 
[02:14:30]  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I love you. 
[02:15:00]  What a nice thing to walk in and see.  An XM.  It's a little XM backpack.  Backpack.  And it says unleash the power of Team XM on the little notebook that came with the backpack. 
[02:15:30]  That could probably be a different slogan.  I don't know.  That's a little corporate and silly.  Team XM.  It's us and Bob Dylan.  Let's hear what the power of Team XM is.  Let me hear.  There it is.  Oh, it's great. 
[02:16:00]  Isn't that wonderful?  Yeah, it's wonderful.  All right.  Thank you.  I don't appreciate this making fun of Hawk.  No.  No.  No.  No.  He doesn't deserve it.  Hey, what the...  Oh, a bignana?  Bignana.  I'm changing fruits.  Oh.  I want to announce that it's the end of blueberry season.  Is it?  And we're now going to start eating bignanas.  First day of...  Bignana season?  Summer officially.  How long has Nosferatu, by the way, been tailing the show? 
[02:16:30]  It's the first day.  Oh, here's a Jesus.  Nosferatu.  Guy's got Transylvania dirt on his back.  Fucking head in those ears.  He's our new intern.  I know he is.  I saw him this morning.  Holy shit.  Who are you?  Jason.  Hi, Mike, Jason.  Hi, you might want to grow your hair over your ears.  There's nothing I can do about my ears, man.  It's been like this in sixth grade when I lost my hair.  You lost your hair in sixth grade? 
[02:17:00]  A little bit, Lauren.  Are you trying to make it funny?  Once I finally cut it, it just never came back.  Wow.  No, when did you start losing your hair, really?  No one loses their hair in sixth grade.  I was 18, 19?  10th grade.  No, I would say about 17.  I had really long hair in the front and back.  A girl bleached it black for me one day.  And ever since then, I think we kind of burned it.  It never came back.  Wow.  That sounds impossible.  How old are you?  But she burned it in the pattern of male pattern baldness.  Yeah.  I know.  I was going to hold it for garments.  What a coincidence. 
[02:17:30]  You're blaming it on dyeing your hair?  No, I was just saying, I think that...  It never grew back.  Wouldn't you have bald spots on the sides if that was the case?  Yeah.  Well, like I said, when she did it, my hair, we kind of left it in and it burned.  So I was going to go bald regardless.  That wasn't the issue.  But I think that it progressed it.  In my opinion, I could be wrong.  What did you dye it with?  When was it gone?  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I stepped on your toes.  No, no, no.  I was actually just asking you what you dye it with.  It was going to be a funny one.  No.  What did you dye it with?  Genetics.  Okay. 
[02:18:00]  That's good.  When was it, like, gone?  It was gone completely, I guess, like, 18, 19.  Oh, my God.  18, 19.  That sucks.  And then, unfortunately, my ears kept growing and my nose was in.  Now I'm stuck.  What can you do?  No, I'm just saying, like, the hair thing.  Yeah, well.  I don't give a shit about your ears.  I'm just saying.  I knew a guy in high school, though, too, like, by 10th, 11th grade, started really losing  all of his hair.  Yeah.  Wow, that's a bitch.  What a prom.  That must have been a cummerbund and a wig.  Tim in Pennsylvania, how do you bleach your hair black? 
[02:18:30]  Good point, sir.  Bleach your hair black?  Everyone is picking up on that.  You dye it black.  Do you want to be in radio tonight?  Because you're 31.  He looks a little young in 31, but he's, you know, you're interning?  Yeah.  Okay, it's an odd, usually guys like 1920s, so what were you doing before this?  I kind of got, I was in prosthetics and orthotics, and I was doing other work.  Oh, my goodness.  What a ghoul.  Prosthetics, and you are a ghoulish kind of guy with that occupation.  Well, it was kind of something that helped me out when I had a child. 
[02:19:00]  It was good work, you know, for insurance and stuff, but it wasn't for me, so I kind of  went back to what I'd like to do, which was radio.  That's what I always worked in.  Radio or artificial limbs.  It's true.  So a lot of people with their stumps would come in, and what would you do?  Well, basically, you have to cast them up.  You got to do all the measurements and make them a prosthetic leg.  Make them a leg.  Or foot orthotics, or, you know, cam walkers, braces, whatever you need, whether it's off  the shelf or you have to really make it.  I'm interested.  I hope he's getting a little impatient with your speech here. 
[02:19:30]  You're medical.  What happened?  He was in orthotics and prosthetics.  Oh.  Do you ever put a leg on a girl and hum Beatles songs?  Unfortunately, they weren't that nice to look at.  Do you ever have to make a little leg for a little kid?  Little legs, little arms, unfortunately.  Cute little arms.  A pile of arms.  A pile of inoculated arms.  Inoculated arms.  It hit me like a diamond bullet. 
[02:20:00]  A little apocalypse for you.  Thank you.  All right, Jason.  Well, thank you, Jason.  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  Good.  And you're the first intern, I think, ever to have his own music the second you first  walked in.  Where's his music?  I want it as he leaves.  Ah, very nice.  Either that or he's the vulture from the Spider-Man cartoons.  Oh, he bugs me. 
[02:20:30]  Creepy prosthetics.  Great music for him.  His little bag full of baby hands.  Sometimes I just jerk myself off with them.  And I'll take a baby finger and put it in my backside while I do it.  Huh?  What's up, B-Rock?  Why?  Because this is good.  Oh.  That's his bit.  He's being scary.  Oh, cool.  All right.  Well, that's wonderful.  Replace Jason immediately.  Like immediately.  Grease mark on the window.  Like his greasy, nervous nose.  Justin in North Dakota, probably. 
[02:21:00]  North or Notre Dame.  Yeah, North Dakota.  Yeah.  Justin, what's up?  I don't know, man.  I suppose I got to start out with you guys rock, don't you know.  Fucking...  I listen to you guys like 100 hours a week for three weeks in a row here, man.  Never had to change a channel.  You guys are awesome.  All right.  Thank you.  Just awesome, man.  Thank you, sir.  Tried to call in for the third time this morning, but...  Wow.  100 hours in a row.  We're very famous.  Three weeks for 100.  Wow.  Three weeks for 100 hours a week, man.  Never had to change it. 
[02:21:30]  In that time, what was the best bit you heard?  Uh-oh.  You guys...  All right.  You got me, though.  Yeah, you did.  Too smart for me.  He knows.  Well, at least we know you've been listening, though.  Hey, it's time for another song parody from Dave from New Jersey.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Letterman.  Letterman.  Letterman.  Letterman.  Oh, when they were on Letterman.  Anthony, really good.  Oh, he was stiff as wood.  Was he scared of Dave Letterman? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, he was off his game.  Next time's an ant with big A.  Anthony did a shtick.  Oh, he looked like his sidekick.  Blew it on David Letterman.  To them, it was a great appearance.  Except for Ope's disappearance.  I'm David Letterman.  Now, that was hurtful.  That was very hurtful. 
[02:22:30]  And kind of uncomfortable and inaccurate.  I was engaged.  I was engaged in the whole thing.  Of course.  I didn't look as stiff as wood.  Watch it.  The only thing you did wrong was step on a really good laugh that you got just by talking after it,  which after I was in a bad mood that morning, got like a really huge laugh,  and you were just chatting after it.  Because I had more to that.  Who knows what to do after they start laughing?  Like, ah, how long do you let it go?  Just hoping to get out of there without them chasing us around with pitchforks and fire. 
[02:23:00]  Well, that does actually throw you at a TV taping, is that what they do is they laugh,  and they clap.  Yeah.  And it really is weird with your timing, because you're like, normally you say something,  oh, say that.  Yeah, you want to finish.  But when you pause like that, they laugh, and then they clap, and it kind of fucks up  your timing.  Oh, what do I do?  Normally I don't pause as well.  And we're radio guys.  We don't get to see the audience reaction to what we do.  Yeah, yeah.  I was fine with my appearance on David Letterman.  You should have. 
[02:23:30]  It was a good appearance.  It wasn't just a fine appearance.  It was a good appearance.  You could check it out on YouTube.  It's a great appearance.  YouTube.  Search Opie and Anthony.  Here's Coke Logic.  Explain to me about this.  You're on satellite radio part of the time, and then you're on the terrestrial radio part  of the time.  Which part is which?  How does that work?  I think it's very confusing.  Well, my dude, I'll explain it.  I know what he's playing off.  What happened?  In the beginning of the interview, I was ready to talk, and you just steamrolled over me. 
[02:24:00]  And I even went, like my mouth was open.  Wait, wait, wait.  What did you say there?  Nothing.  I was starting to say something.  But see, that was the problem.  You were turned toward Letterman.  I was ready to go for the big answer of the question.  My mouth was open.  What were you going to say?  And then you see my reaction like, all right, well.  Oh, shit.  I swear to God.  What were you going to say?  That's what he's playing off.  I don't know anymore.  It's a week ago.  Oh, my God.  But that's what he's playing off.  Listen again.  It's Coke Logic.  Because my mouth was open. 
[02:24:30]  I even said, like, well.  I think I got well out.  I was gearing up.  I said, well.  Who said the first thing on the show?  I did.  Who got the first words on the show?  Thank you.  I'm not going to sit here now and take this abuse.  I did.  And I guess that was too much for you because then you got the.  No, it wasn't.  Then you got the next thousand words.  I did not.  Coke Logic again.  Explain to me about this.  You're on a satellite radio part of the time.  And then you're on the terrestrial radio part of the time. 
[02:25:00]  Which part is which?  How does that work?  It gets very confusing.  From 6 a.m. Eastern to 9.  We're on.  I'm sure you know because you were there.  Go ahead.  But at some point you actually get up and change studios.  Yeah.  Well, I was going to explain that.  But why did you?  Go ahead.  One company didn't want us doing.  Why don't you explain what's in my head?  And this is all being broadcast on one or the other?  On XM?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We take wireless mice.  Well, why did you guys?  We see how miserable New Yorkers are working to work.  That actually sounds like it's a lot of fun. 
[02:25:30]  That is hilarious.  Oh, that is a good one.  Oh, that is damn funny.  Now, that one I like.  Coke Logic.  Way to go.  Good job, bro.  Good job.  And we're just kidding.  I really, really enjoyed...  What is this?  I love Eric Logan.  Pink Innos?  What?  Can I read the note Elo said?  We just got Pink Innos.  The portable units. 
[02:26:00]  And this is Little Jimmy from Eric Logan.  I know that you have many women in your life.  Some paid, some not.  However, we are trying to move XM, make XM a viable business, and I'm not in a position  to send you 500 Pink Innos.  I'll get to work on that.  So choose your favorite and pass it along or keep it and look sweet.  I love you, Elo.  Thank you, Eric, very much.  These are great.  Pink Innos.  And right from Yahoo Finance.  Pioneer and XM introduced Pink Inno XM to go.  Player with a Portion of Proceeds to Benefit Breast Cancer Research. 
[02:26:30]  Look at that.  Aw!  Doing something nice.  Limited edition, it says.  Pink Innos.  Hey, what is this?  That's cool.  You get me a...  You get a picture with me and my Pink Inno, you're fired.  Without the head...  Ew, I don't want these headphones.  These headphones stink.  Ooh.  Oh, we both get the...  Oh, I like the headphones.  I'm sorry.  That's for me.  Yeah, let's get Elo on the phone. 
[02:27:00]  Nice.  I'm a sweet boy.  What's with the gifts?  What's with...  It's cool.  What's with the gifts?  I have so many XM radios at my house that are, I think, plugged in.  I've got to start giving them away to people.  By the way...  I've got a boom box.  I've got at least five of these Innos that I stole from the PGA when I was checking out  the USO for LA.  Yeah.  We all got them to walk around the course.  They were, you know, fully charged and activated, and I just walked off the course with them. 
[02:27:30]  I've got five of them.  Yeah, why not?  New contest, ladies.  Who can suck the most juice out of my ball bag?  You win a Pink Inno.  Now, I have a question here, because this...  Can we shove the Pink Inno into some pink and see if it's still broadcast?  Pink for pink.  Pink for pink.  I got this XM antenna headphones with it, which are like these hard...  Like, these headphones that go over, they have an antenna in them, hence the name.  Are these the ones for the Inno, or are they just an additional...  Like, do I need to wear these to make for my Inno to work? 
[02:28:00]  No.  I didn't know that.  Any headphone ear buds type thing will work with the Inno.  I didn't know that, because I have very tiny ears, so it's hard for me to use the  hard plastic ones.  Yes.  So I haven't been using my Inno at home, because I didn't think I could use regular  headphones.  These just have the antenna built in.  They're just an additional help.  Yeah.  To improve the already great reception.  Okay.  Oh, very good.  Well, XM does have a good reception, because of the repeaters.  I get dropped in my car once every fucking week.  Yeah, I got to communicate. 
[02:28:30]  Travis wants to know if he could have a Pink Inno.  He does.  It's called his pussy.  That was too easy, actually.  Yeah.  I'm embarrassed that I went there.  Who wrote it?  I'll take credit, even though someone else wrote it.  Whoever wrote it, let's say goodbye to them.  Step up and be fired.  No, it was E-Rock.  Oh.  E-Rock?  Oh, I should have known that was an E-Rock communique.  Yeah.  Eric Logan, everyone.  Trying to grow a goatee.  Elo.  Elo, how's the goatee?  Coming in good. 
[02:29:00]  I'm actually just not even shaving.  I'm protesting.  Are you?  What are you protesting?  I have no idea.  Something.  Something will come out.  Oh, great.  I'm looking for a cause.  I knew it would happen.  You're losing your mind.  I'm protesting.  Bob Eatman is sending me emails trying to still pick me up for half the dinner tab.  He actually scanned the receipt and sent it to me.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  The receipt.  Tell him to suck it up.  So I replied back to it.  And by the way, it didn't even come from him.  It came from his assistant.  He didn't even send it.  Oh, my God.  So I replied to his assistant and said, I have no recollection of this at all. 
[02:29:30]  I believe it should have been a three-way split.  Absolutely.  I agree.  Yes.  So you guys are doing something nice for breast cancer.  Yeah.  That's very nice.  Pink Enos.  That is nice.  Very cool.  Yeah, they're very cool.  Are they all activated, Eric?  I can just give it to someone?  The ones that you guys have should be all activated and ready to go.  They've got upgraded software on them and everything.  Will XM support my contest idea?  You know, I think your contest idea is brilliant, by the way. 
[02:30:00]  What is it?  Train his bag.  Whichever girl trains my bag, the best wins an N-O, which means a bunch of them have to  try it, and one of them not only gets hepatitis, but you get something to listen to while  you're in the hospital.  I can provide some qualifying prizes if you'd like, like XM t-shirts and some swag for you,  Jimmy.  Nice.  This is why we love Elon.  That's a great idea, actually.  I've received many XM radios over the couple of years that we've been here that have supposedly  been activated. 
[02:30:30]  I have 20 XM accounts that I pay on a monthly basis.  This one should be actually, you should turn it on.  Yearly or whatever.  Well, if you contact Wickland, I had one that was older that I wasn't going to use because  I got the N-O, so I wanted to give it to my acting teacher because he loves radio.  And I just called Don Wickland and it was activated and he loves it.  I can't be bothered.  He loves it.  I just, I call up the number.  Refresh page.  I just call up the number and say, yeah, yeah, throw another radio on my account.  What's the refresh page? 
[02:31:00]  How many, how many, how many, how many, how many accounts do I pay for, Elo?  I can look it up and find out for you.  If it's more than two, someone's getting fired.  Yeah, but you got a hundred radios though.  I know.  Exactly.  Exactly.  By the way, Opie, the PGA tour people did call me.  They go, you know, Opie walked off with our radios.  I go, what?  He did?  Wow.  I'll get right on that.  Oh.  They work great and they made for great gifts this summer.  Hey, wait, what's the refresh page?  What is that?  Refresh.xmradio.com. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, that's great.  Elo.  Yo.  And I'm not going to hang out for you, I promise you.  I finally heard Bob Dylan's show.  You did?  Holy shit, is it good.  That's a very good show, actually.  But he, but what's weird is he talks in like sing song.  Yes.  Did you catch it over the weekend where we played all of them?  No, I wish I did.  I don't know when it's on, so I just caught a deal.  Wednesday's at 10, like it's coming up at 10 o'clock today on Deep Tracks.  There's a new show premiering today at 10.  When does it re-air?  Uh, 10, it re-airs twice today, and then it premieres on The Village on Fridays at 10. 
[02:32:00]  But it's mostly on Deep Tracks.  Deep Tracks is where he lives, yeah.  Yeah, I was driving home from North Carolina and I caught the whole hour, and man, the time  flew by.  He's really interesting.  It's amazing.  People don't, I mean, people are like, how stupid is Dylan?  But it's actually a very compelling show.  He's a brilliant guy.  He plays songs you've never heard in your life that are really cool.  If that makes sense.  We have to go find this music, because he's suggesting records that we don't even have. 
[02:32:30]  Really?  Yeah, and you've got to remember, we've got over 3 million songs in our library.  3 million.  3 million.  Yeah.  Hope's right, though.  He talks, he kind of has a sing-songy thing.  Well, because everyone knows that Dylan mumbles.  But he doesn't mumble during his radio show, but it looks like he's trying not to mumble,  so he comes up with this, like, sing-song delivery.  That's kind of interesting.  It's different.  There's nothing, trust me, there's nothing like it on the radio, much like the virus.  Hmm.  Do we have more listeners than Bob Dylan? 
[02:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  We do?  Oh, yeah.  Are we one of the greatest things to ever happen in your life?  If not the greatest.  What was the worst thing that happened in your life in radio?  Would it be the old blink thing?  No, the blink thing wasn't the worst.  No?  No.  That was actually a lot of fun, actually.  The concept was brilliant.  Well, yeah.  Eric, you can't.  I'm serious.  It was.  Eric can't be.  And it should have worked.  It's not bad for Eric, because it's not his fault he got caught up in the ideas of some 
[02:33:30]  boob.  Who's just there?  The execution sucked, but the concept was great.  What happened?  With what, oh, for me?  Probably the worst thing that happened to me was when I was Cody the Coyote.  He was a mascot and got drunk in a bar at 19.  You were what?  You haven't stopped.  You were what?  You were who?  I was, well, no.  My first job in radio was Chuck the Duck.  You were Chuck the Duck, and then you were Cody the Coyote? 
[02:34:00]  Yes.  I have two photos in my office right now.  You want me to put them on PalTalk?  Yes.  Yes.  Hold on.  Immediately.  Wait, wait.  We've got to find you on PalTalk, PalTalk, PalTalk.  Do you want, do you want, so Anthony, do you want the, which one do you want?  Do you want the Cody picture first, or do you want the Chuck the Duck photo?  What's your screen name again?  Let's see.  What am I?  Who am I?  Oh, the real Elo.  The real Elo.  Okay, I got it.  Yeah.  Okay.  So there we go.  I couldn't find you.  All right.  That's me as Chuck the Duck right there. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, my God.  He really impressed me.  Oh, hold on.  Damn it.  I've got to get it.  Wait a minute.  Hold it up there for a couple of seconds more.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I can't find him.  Shit.  And by the way, the kid, that's my little brother, Tony, that's with me right there.  You have it up there.  There he is.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Who's that?  That's Chuck the Duck.  That's Chuck the Duck.  That's Elo as Chuck the Duck.  All right.  Look at the mouth so wide open.  I had that.  Yeah, that is a yearning bill you got there.  Look at the mouth open. 
[02:35:00]  Chuck the Duck sure could suck.  Well, that's where I did this when I was 16 years old.  And then when I turned 17, I got a promotion and became that guy.  That is Cody the Coyote.  Cody the Coyote.  Oh, let me see Cody the Coyote.  Hold on.  You're going to laugh, Jimmy.  That's me.  Ew.  Ew.  Wow.  And what did you have to do?  In the middle of the Oklahoma summers, I had to stand on car lots, black asphalt, 110 degrees 
[02:35:30]  for three or four hours, waving on the side of a road to have people come in and buy a car  at a remote.  Wow.  You know, when the DJs are out there, like, come by, no percent financing, come get a  free car, hot dogs, popcorn, you know, those hacky remotes we used to always do?  Mm-hmm.  I was the station mascot for two different radio stations.  That's amazing.  There you go.  Is that how you got into radio?  That's how I got into radio. 
[02:36:00]  Phew.  I got in the door at this little radio station, which was right here at KEBC, and then I became  the program director at 20 and took it to number one by my 21st birthday.  Look at him.  And then I went to Seattle and blah, blah, blah.  So, there you go.  Thank you for sharing.  There you go.  Thank you, by the way, for the, you know, Cody.  Very cool.  Cody.  Chuck the Duck.  I'm sure there will not be one Photoshop done.  Absolutely.  That will address Chuck the Duck or Cody the Coyote. 
[02:36:30]  And what's even worse, and I've told, there are air checks of me out there when I was on  the air, and there's actually video of me, because I was the entertainment reporter for  the ABC affiliate, Channel 5 in Oklahoma City, interviewing Toby Keith and all the country  stars, where I'm wearing glasses and country and western shirts on the TV set.  All right.  That I must see.  And then, hey, for a grand finale, could you go swimming with Stevie the Stingray? 
[02:37:00]  And by the way, on these Photoshop's of Chuck and Cody, I want to say for the record,  I don't want any of them engaged in homosexual activity.  That would not be right.  That's not good.  I really, I don't think.  No, that's not even appropriate.  And it doesn't even fit.  No.  Like, it would look silly.  Yeah, they'd like to have that Chuck and Cody.  Yeah, with like a big penis, like, positioned by his.  Yeah, not cool.  Not cool, guys.  Not cool at all.  We don't want to see that on Whack Bag or Fibonades.  He's our leader. 
[02:37:30]  Not cool.  Should I make it easier for the army of pests who are now emailing me incestuously?  Just go ahead and put these online?  Yeah.  Yeah, I would do that.  Hey, is the pink Eno coming out to distract everyone from all the lawsuits?  Oh, God.  No.  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  I've got to go to my email.  Hold on a second.  Approved talking points.  Hold on a second here.  XM's confident that the actions are 100% appropriate if we maintain the shareholder lawsuit. 
[02:38:00]  There you go.  Well, hey, didn't.  FCC inquiries are common.  That's why I love this guy.  He goes with it.  Holy shit.  Wait, didn't XM just win something from the FCC, too?  Did they approve something, which was good, right?  Well, no, the FCC, they re-approved our radio IDs.  Okay, good.  Not bad.  One down, 20 to go.  That's right.  Every marathon begins with a step.  Just because there were a couple of units where the transmitter could cook a hot dog on, 
[02:38:30]  you just put a little hot dog on the antenna.  Oh, that's an exaggeration.  Yeah.  So the pink Eno's is going to be a hot item, especially as we get closer to the holiday season.  Yes, just in time for the holiday season.  And we're donating $35 of every one of these to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.  They're going to be available exclusively at Circuit City starting on September 10th.  You're donating $30 per unit?  Yes, we are.  I thought it would be $1 or something. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  That's righteous bucks.  That's pretty cool.  Great.  Yeah.  It's going to be a good thing.  When does Oprah start?  Oprah on the 25th.  What are the odds of getting her on our show to help promote?  Hold on.  Let me go to my email.  Hey, how about...  Approve talking points.  A little slim to none.  I don't know.  Maybe...  Shareholder lawsuits are on...  Oh, sorry.  That's the wrong one.  Hold on.  I need to have PR kind of reply to that one. 
[02:39:30]  Hold on.  Maybe we get Oprah on.  She won't have rappers on because of some of the content.  Yeah.  It's been a little controversial.  And one of the single biggest ones is Ludacris, of course.  I have a show with him.  Now, by the way, speaking of shows, that's another show that's probably as good as Dylan's  show, by the way.  Ludacris?  Yes.  I got pictures with two of your best rappers, Ludacris and Snoop.  Snoop Dogg?  And I only got the Snoop one because of the XM tie-in.  The publicist was...  She's like, are you with Sirius?  I'm like, no, XM.  She's like, all right.  And she let me get a picture with him.  That's pretty cool.  With a Constantine? 
[02:40:00]  With a Constantine?  Holla, Jim.  Holla.  I don't know.  She was a publicist.  The first publicist I've met that I like.  She was very nice.  Yeah.  All right, Hilo.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Bye-bye, Hilo.  Bye-bye.  Thank you for the Inno, Hilo.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Pink Inno's for everybody.  That's nice.  We get them, and they save some tits, which is always nice.  What?  You could use that language.  That's what they're doing.  It's a wonderful thing.  Thank you.  30 bucks a unit. 
[02:40:30]  It's a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the bread.  Squeeze the bread.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hot piece of air.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  The Opium Anthony Show.  In case you didn't know, sure. 
[02:41:00]  What do you got, Ann?  What do you got?  I don't know. 
[02:41:30]  Union workers' credit service.  Nice.  What this is.  Sometimes I get mail delivered here, and I don't know why.  Yeah?  Make check or money order payable.  What the hell is this?  Hey, I've been approved for a $10,000 limit.  Make a copy of this for Derek.  Workers' credit service card.  We're going to do this next.  Okay.  Why do I have to send them money, then? 
[02:42:00]  We're professional broadcasters, then.  What happened over there?  But you got approved.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  What do you want to do next?  Jimmy's back.  This American Express card, they do everything for you.  They say if a girl's blowing you and she doesn't want to swallow, they'll send a representative  over and it'll hold her head down.  This place is the greatest.  We got one more current event story to do, and then we're going to get into some silly  stuff. 
[02:42:30]  Silly.  You guys see the video of the youth football assistant coach tackling one of the players?  What happened?  It's the video of the day.  Got a little out of hand?  It's great.  Yeah.  I guess there was a late hit, and assistant coach from the other team didn't appreciate  the late hit on one of his boys, so he runs out there and just crushes one of the kids.  Clocks a kid?  Yeah.  What an ass.  Were they high school students?  How old were they?  I would say 15?  No, between 7 and 14 were the ages.  Between 7 and 14? 
[02:43:00]  7-year-olds on the same field as 14-year-olds?  That's what it said.  That's what the league has.  What the hell is...  Oh, the league.  Yeah, you couldn't put them on the...  Well, you probably could, but you'd really have to balance it out racially to equal it.  I was going to say.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  All right.  The weird thing is, they're all third graders.  I just did math in my head.  Was that an accurate joke?  Close enough.  I might have had to say second graders. 
[02:43:30]  Here's the audio.  Once he's seen him charging, hit him like that, from the back of the head, I mean...  Stockton Bears coach Rudy Garrido shows how the assistant coach from the opposing team  put the hurt on one of his players,  rushing out to hit the player from behind and knocking him to the ground.  For a parent slash coach to come out and attack one of my kids, it's just something that's just terrifying.  The Stockton Bears in the dark uniforms faced the Redskins from Riverbank.  It was towards the end of the game, less than a minute to play. 
[02:44:00]  The score had the Redskins leading 16-6, and then a second after the play ended, a late hit.  The Redskins player hit by a Stockton Bear.  And right after that, the Redskins player's father, who is also an assistant coach,  runs onto the field to deliver his own knockdown tackle.  Jesus.  Fucking parents.  Animal.  With their fucking kids and sports.  I'm sick of these fucking dad slash coaches.  How about this? 
[02:44:30]  If one of your shit dick kids is on the team, you can't coach it.  Yeah.  Shouldn't be allowed.  But they're not going to get coaches then.  You know what?  Then fuck them.  Read instead of playing sports.  They'll get coaches.  Stupid parents.  There are pedophiles everywhere.  Absolutely.  We're going to work with children.  Immediately after that, fans from both teams crowded onto this field.  Of course they did.  And they started to trade punches.  Among those at the game was Jose Santanillas and his 11-year-old son, Joseph, who was playing for the Bears. 
[02:45:00]  Majority of them were just trying to get everybody just rushed in all at the same time,  and they were just trying to get everybody away from everybody,  trying to make sure that the kids are safe.  It was just scary.  The guy just grabbed that kid.  Dude, and everybody just rushed in.  Mm-hmm.  I was scared.  The assistant coach made a getaway over a tall fence, but later surrendered to police.  I have been cooperative with the investigation and was booked into the San Joaquin County Jail  on one count of felony child abuse.  Facing that charge of child abuse is 36-year-old Cory Potero of Riverbank. 
[02:45:30]  It's child abuse, huh?  Yeah.  It's not even like assault or something like that?  Oh.  That's a tough charge.  You got to see the hit, though.  It's great.  I did see it.  Pretty impressive.  Yeah.  Pretty impressive.  Nice hit on the kid.  Wow.  Is he going to have to register or something for child abuse?  I can take myself out of the situation.  That's why it's impressive.  Yeah.  I don't know the kid. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  I don't care.  It's impressive because I don't know him.  It's another asshole parent.  Fucking putting too much emphasis on their dumb kids' sports accomplishments.  Yeah.  Because they were failures.  Wait a second.  They're failures.  There's more to this story.  Joe, is this true?  Cleveland?  Go.  Well, what I saw on a today show this morning kind of ticked me off.  And while I don't agree with a kid being hit by an assistant coach or parent, the kid  that the kid hit on the opposing team in the late hit was like half of his size. 
[02:46:30]  The kid that performed the late hit was closer to the adult size than he was the kid size.  So that might have pissed off the assistant coach.  Sure.  See a big guy doing a late hit on a kid that's half his size.  I'm sure the kid who did the late hit is a little jerk off.  But the bottom line is that the league should not allow them to interact.  They should not be playing football together if there's the possibility that...  Because even if we say it wasn't a late hit, say it was an on-time hit, he could have  still hurt the kid.  So, you know.  Yeah.  Right.  But what really pissed me off was this morning on the Today Show, the kid who was hit by the 
[02:47:00]  assistant coach, his mom was sitting there going, oh, he didn't do anything wrong.  There was nothing wrong in the play.  He didn't do anything, a damn thing wrong.  And this assistant coach just ran out for no reason and struck him.  How about this?  The fucking...  They should make the kids all play naked and the parents should be sent home.  That's the way I feel.  It should be handled.  This way everybody wins.  I see one part of that that just seems a little off.  I know.  Yeah.  They're going to get their own transportation.  Home.  Sam in Colorado, what's up? 
[02:47:30]  Hey, I'm a coach in a lot of other sports, but I tell you what, the kids are great.  It's those damn people getting away.  Yeah.  Those fucking...  They just need to get the hell out of there.  They argue calls and all that.  Hey, my kids not getting to play in time!  Yeah, and they're the biggest losers of all.  I grew up with most of them, and they're the ones that always sit on the bench and guarded  the Gatorade.  All right.  Thank you, Sam.  My kids not getting to play in time!  Very insightful.  Thank you, Sam.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right. 
[02:48:00]  Yes.  The biggest thing for the parent is their kids' sporting event, because they're such...  They've turned into such nothings.  Yep.  That's all they have left.  When is the drive for their kids.  When was the last time you went to a kid's sporting event?  Never.  Me?  Last weekend.  Seriously?  No.  Complete fabrication.  For the most part, the parents behave.  Do they?  Here's how you know...  Someone has to stick up for the parents.  For the most part, they do.  Here's how you know you're a parent who should be fucking shot at your kid's sporting event. 
[02:48:30]  If you ever stand at the chain link fence and hold on to it and talk to your kid through  it, you should be fucking shot.  If you clap like this...  You should be shot.  You know how you should act like Vic Morrow in Bad News Bears?  Walk up and slap your kid right in the face.  Or somebody else's kid, simply for racial reasons.  And it doesn't have to be white on black.  Matter of fact, if you're a black hitter and a white pitcher strikes you out, the black 
[02:49:00]  parents should be able to come onto that mound and slap your dirty white face.  Slap you silly.  All right.  Moving on.  Who cares?  John on Long Island.  John.  Hey.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Jimmy was mentioning a poll on HBO yesterday about Lucky Louie.  Yes, sir.  I can't find it on the site anywhere.  Well, if you go to either Foundry or opanthony.com or my MySpace page, there is a link to the  HBO poll for Lucky Louie. 
[02:49:30]  The survey.  Thank you very much, Jimmy.  Thank you, man.  Appreciate it.  I guess it's linked on our site.  Yeah.  Tommy, California.  They had blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I knew it, Sam.  I knew all that.  It was just time to plug the poll thing.  Yeah.  That's how we did it.  Certainly.  See?  We look like radio professionals there.  Tom, go.  Yeah, I played sports my whole life.  If my dad would have saw me do some cheap move like that, he would have belted me, too.  Yeah, maybe on the way home, or like my dad would do after the sporting event, we'd park 
[02:50:00]  the car in the woods, and he'd make me lap dance him in a uniform.  What?  This kid is...  Tom, I think you're confused.  This guy, like, didn't belt his own kid for the late hit.  Oh, what I got from it was that he...  You are a blithering idiot.  Exactly.  What you should have got from it, then, is a smack to your dumb non-listening face.  Hey, let's have some fun with music.  And I'll provide it.  We're going to do some famous firsts.  Famous firsts.  Famous firsts.  Famous firsts. 
[02:50:30]  Firsts.  Sizzes.  Firstases.  All right.  I'll have a little fun with this.  The Beatles, I'll say.  The Beatles.  For example.  Ooh, who's more likely to make a squishy sound in their own hat, get shot, and marry a gimp?  This is where the listeners get to play along and try to...  They love the trivia.  They love the trivia out there.  Squishy sound in his hat. 
[02:51:00]  God damn you, man.  Now I've got to listen to the replay, because I missed out.  I'm so missed out.  Did you miss that one?  Yeah, because I started the bit.  Oh, it was so uncalled for.  I'll get it in the replay.  That's okay.  I'll be laughing by myself, as I feel very lonely.  But I'm not lonely.  See, I just made that as a joke.  All right.  That's good.  Right now, he's having the light and lively George Harrison skull. 
[02:51:30]  Old yogurt heads.  Can't hear it.  Oh, damn it.  Throw a marble in there.  No, you can't hear it.  Ha-choo!  Famous first, this is.  Guys, what was the first rock album released on CD?  First rock album released on CD. 
[02:52:00]  There's two answers to this, by the way.  Two answers.  Is there one because it was a re-release?  All right, here's what we're looking for.  The first rock album released on CD ever.  Ever.  And then the first one released in the United States.  Dark Side of the Moon.  Nope.  First one, it was the Def Leppard CD, Patty Cakes My Foot.  I guess we're both wrong. 
[02:52:30]  How about, wait, is it?  Now I have to think back earlier.  I will give you the year.  Okay.  Oh, that'll help.  The first rock album released on CD.  The year was 1978.  78 on a CD?  No, it was re-released on a CD.  Was it on a CD in 78?  Or was it re-released?  The album was released in 78.  Oh, my God, let me look.  What the hell happened?  I think I know what it is, actually.  All right. 
[02:53:00]  Okay.  All right.  The album is from 1978.  I'm glad you asked a question.  Yeah.  This happened in, yeah, I thought that was a little too early.  1982.  82.  Album released in 78.  And it was the first album released on CD in 82.  Don't look at the phone screens.  I'm not.  I swear to you.  Because they got the same magazine I got.  They're cheating.  They're cheating because no one would get this answer.  I will say the band is The Who. 
[02:53:30]  Nope.  Is it?  Nope.  No.  It's Rod Stewart's album, Seed Belly.  Hey, 78.  What was out in 78?  Like, fucking disco.  Is it disco?  It's Blondie.  It's a rock album.  Rock album.  Rock album.  God damn it.  How about Peter Frampton?  Album came out in 78.  The CD was released in 82 in Japan.  Boston.  The answer is...  Any other guesses? 
[02:54:00]  No.  Billy Joel.  Billy Joel.  Glass houses.  52nd Street.  Fuck.  Do we have a song from 52nd Street?  Wow.  Yeah.  Okay.  Is this the hit?  Isn't there a hit from that album?  Oh, Derek doesn't know Billy Joel.  Derek's not a big Billy Joel fan.  Wow.  How about the hit?  I think I finally heard a Billy Joel song I've never heard before.  I know.  What the hell was that?  Wow.  That was the title track, I believe.  I guess so.  Which wasn't the hit. 
[02:54:30]  Is it Bottle of Red on that?  Is it?  I don't know.  I'm guessing it's not.  I think that was The Stranger.  I think that was off of The Stranger, which was like full of hits.  Yeah, let me...  Yeah, full of hits.  His daughter is ugly, is singing now.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  I thought we were playing word association.  No.  Yeah, here you go.  Yeah, here's a hit.  There you go.  Big shot.  Didn't you? 
[02:55:00]  My life was on this album.  My life's on that, too.  Honesty.  Honesty.  Limousine.  That's it.  That was really funny.  It is ugly.  No.  See, I was testing you.  You have your test?  No, she's going into a...  She's breaking into her musical career.  I heard she's good, actually.  You have a mom like Christy Brinkley, and man, you get a lot of... 
[02:55:30]  You got a lot of Billy...  You got a lot of Billy DNA in you.  She looks better than she used to.  I'll give her that.  No, she's ugly.  They kind of try to doll her up a little bit.  All right.  Thank you.  Here's the story.  Joel's 1978 album is issued as a shiny CD, the first of its kind, in Japan.  That must have played better.  Great.  Japan.  I bet that's all that CD did the whole time. 
[02:56:00]  CD stunk back then.  What came first, the CD or the CD player?  Because, you know, how would that work?  How would that work?  You couldn't sell a goddamn CD.  You can't come up with a CD player and just sit in an electronic store with nothing to play on it.  What, do you just wait until they actually make the CDs?  I would say the CD player, but like crap for it.  Yeah.  Like classical music.  Yep.  All right.  Two years later.  So we're now up to the year 1984.  The first.  The first rock album in the United States.  And it was a new album. 
[02:56:30]  On CD?  Yes.  It was a new album.  Van Halen's 1984.  Ooh, that's a really good answer, but you are wrong.  Phil Collins.  Wait, how about.  I don't know.  I'm trying to pick something that I wouldn't think it would be.  Because I didn't think Billy Joel.  Wait.  1984.  Rock band?  He's one of your favorites.  Oh.  As far as this radio show goes.  Maybe not a dime.  No, it's Bruce Springsteen.  There you go.  Bruce Springsteen.  Bruce Springsteen.  Song.  What are you? 
[02:57:00]  Born in the USA.  Oh, look at Derek.  You're right on it.  Wait, find that obscure one, Derek.  Quick.  That's right.  Whoa.  Becomes the first press in the U.S. in 1984.  The first rock album released on CD in the U.S.  Fantastic.  Shut up.  Yeah, you're a working man in your blue jeans.  We can all relate, Bruce.  That's a drive up to your mansion. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Hey, he's getting a divorce.  Yeah, he is.  Or are they now working it out again?  Now he's got to be dumping her.  Oh, more.  Yeah.  He's wearing a bandana so he could wipe the sweat off his forehead for when he's working  in a coal mine or something.  Just like you and I.  Yeah, he's just like the working man.  He's the working man.  Trying to figure out how to make meat.  As he drives his Mercedes.  Yeah. 
[02:58:00]  Mercedes to the recording studio.  No.  Club Zoda Kenny, could you get me a smoothie?  I'm in the U.S.  That was a bomb.  Yeah.  All right, all right.  Enough of this guy.  I want our new intern to sing this.  Born in Transylvania.  Fucking, he's hanging upside down in the office right now with the lights out.  Creep.  All right.  I'm going to give you an easy one.  I'm going to give you. 
[02:58:30]  Do you have enough pictures?  Yeah.  All right.  Really?  I thought you'd need a few more.  Take a few of the intern.  I bet they don't come out.  Wait.  Go ahead.  That's very funny.  Yeah.  Yeah, get a shot.  I get one of his.  This is a special shot for you.  Ass shot.  That could be a good shot.  I would work that into the photo.  Maybe, you know what it is?  There's a mirror, and in the mirror you get to see his ass.  Ooh.  I like that.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Get a picture of the intern. 
[02:59:00]  It won't come out.  All right.  The next one is an easy one.  We'll give you an easy one.  The year is 1981.  First video aired on MTV.  Video killed a radio star.  There you go.  That's easy.  Oh.  By the buggles.  Doesn't know that.  The buggerers.  First Saturday Night Live musical guest.  Oh.  Oh.  I remember this.  Chris Christopherson.  No.  It was John Lennon's chest.  No. 
[02:59:30]  Wait a minute.  It wasn't Chris Christopherson?  No.  Um, first musical guest?  Yeah.  Gary Glitter's laptop.  No.  Speaking of Gary Glitter.  I love him.  I don't know if it's official yet.  NFL wants to ban Rock and Roll Part 1 or Part 2, whatever it is.  It's one of those things.  From football stadiums.  They want to ban the song.  Why?  I don't know where they're at with that, but it was a big news story.  You know. 
[03:00:00]  It is kind of tough, though, to play the big hit of a known pedophile.  But it has nothing to do with him anymore.  This is years ago, and they want to ban this from football stadiums.  The song becomes an entity unto itself once you, like, once it's out there.  Most people don't even know that Gary Glitter did this song.  No.  If you took a poll.  That's the sound of a crying Vietnamese voice.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho. 
[03:00:30]  And then the father walks in.  Hey!  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  There it is.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho, ho. 
[03:01:00]  I can do that all day.  All right, enough.  First Saturday Night Live musical guest.  What year?  75.  That would be old, right?  1975.  George Harrison.  I'm going to say.  There's a connection to George Harrison.  Oh!  Lyle Alzado.  A little connection to George Harrison.  Bill Cosby.  Wait, guys, include me. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, pudding.  Oh, jeez.  He sells pudding.  Oh, my dummy.  He sells pudding, and George carried it under his hat.  Oh, my God.  With that, here's the answer.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[03:02:00]  Dringo.  Oh.  What was this?  That is a song he.  Billy Preston, right?  Yeah, Billy Preston is a song he performs.  Nothing, nothing.  Nothing.  What's the connection to Harrison?  Billy Preston was like the fifth Beatle.  What?  Yeah.  I thought it was on Pete Best.  Oh.  No, I did like a lot of recording with him.  You got to have nothing if you want to be.  All right.  How about the first rock star to date, Winona Ryder? 
[03:02:30]  The singer from Collective Soul?  No.  Too bad it wasn't Phil Spector.  I thought he wasn't a rock star.  Or Ike Turner.  Wasn't Winona in a movie with our new intern?  Wow.  Yeah.  I asked the intern to get me coffee.  All of a sudden, he disappeared.  There were rats all over the floor.  Little bitch. 
[03:03:00]  We're going to have fun with him.  I said he wanted to go out to dinner, but he wouldn't go to a morgue because he only  has his steaks.  Oh, you creep.  The answer is Paul Westerberg.  That's a boring one.  From the replacements.  Yeah.  How about the first rap song to reach number one on the pop charts? 
[03:03:30]  That is Rapper's Delight, 1990.  So you have to-  What?  Jesus.  Walk this way.  What did you do?  Oh, crossover hit.  No?  Walk this way.  When was that?  80-  Oh, 80s, right.  First rap song?  First rap song.  It was number one?  Yeah.  1990?  Yeah.  We didn't acknowledge them until then.  MC Hammers.  Can't touch this. 
[03:04:00]  Ooh.  No.  Shit.  MC Hammer?  Mm-mm.  Um.  Oh, Blondie.  That's 1990.  No, that was in 1990.  God, I'm trying to think of 1990.  The whole year is a fog for me.  Oh, here it comes.  We ran out of time.  Oh.  Oh.  Um. 
[03:04:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck, this is a good one, man.  Really?  VIP.  Yeah.  VIP.  Yeah, boy.  Let's kick it.  Yeah.  I'm picturing that hair and that suit.  It's rough.  All right, stop.  Collaborate and listen.  Collaborate and listen.  Aw, yeah.  No ice.  Yeah.  All right, enough.  Hey, first rocker to eat the remains of his dead bandmate.  This only happened once.  I saw it in that first. 
[03:05:00]  Like it ever happened again.  I saw it in that heavy metal documentary.  Learned about this.  No one's going to get this.  Euronymous was the name of the band.  Wow.  Norwegian black metal band.  Oh, Mayhams.  What?  Who?  What the?  What the?  Oh, the guy's name was Euronymous?  Did he commit suicide?  Okay, he was the guitarist.  All right, here we go.  Norwegian black metal band Mayhams frontman Dead, was his name, blows his own head apart 
[03:05:30]  with a shotgun.  John, guitarist Euronymous cooks up Dead's brain fragments in a stew with ham, vegetables,  and paprika.  Oh, well, you need the paprika.  Bam.  Can you imagine?  It's really good.  Right.  All right.  Let me just do a couple more here.  How about the first rock song?  1951.  Bo Diddley.  No one's going to get this.  How is that going to be considered the first song?  First rock song. 
[03:06:00]  It's got to be some kind of stupid doo-wop song.  Or is it Elvis Snow?  No.  It should be Bo Diddley, but...  51?  It's like almost the 40s.  I'd say like almost two years.  It's got to be a black guy.  A young pre-Tina smacking Ike Turner.  Oh, okay.  Cuts the tune with Brenston and Sun Studios boss Sam Phillips.  I was ahead of my time, Turner said.  I met Elvis in 52.  He was driving a gravel truck. 
[03:06:30]  The song, Rocket 88.  Officially the first rock song.  Oh, well, that made a rock up there.  Sounds like the boys are back in town.  And go.  You women have heard of Jalop.  Have you heard the noise they make?  But let me riddle those.  The good old days. 
[03:07:00]  Right?  Yes, it's great.  Good.  Just one way.  Everybody likes my rock at 88.  Baby, we'll ride in style.  He's talking about his cock.  Yeah.  All along.  That's as good as Hound Dog.  Isn't it weird that it's 88 and it's a black guy singing it?  You know what 88 means, right?  What?  88 is the eighth letter of the alphabet twice. 
[03:07:30]  H-H.  Which, Heil Hitler, white supremacist, used it as a...  Who knew that?  Well.  I got tattooed.  I know my...  Could be happy, happy.  It could, but it's not.  Well, once he got married, hit her.  All right.  Moving on.  Just a couple more here to do.  So, first recorded rap song.  Uh, I'll guess that it's something by, uh... 
[03:08:00]  Is it Africa Bambaataa?  Perhaps Cool Herc?  It's a recorded rap song.  I'll give you a sample of the lyrics.  Okay.  My fingers is large, but my dick is bigger.  Rich Voss.  Open your thighs while I pull my trigger.  This was 15 years before the Sugar Hill Gang.  What year?  1965.  Do we have this?  We don't have this. 
[03:08:30]  This right here, this is kind of interesting.  This is the first recorded rap song.  This is Blowfly.  Not the motherfucking Blowfly.  And Rap Dirty.  This is Slowfly, the master class.  And I'm here to sock some soul to your ass.  This is 65?  Yeah.  Motherfucker, this guy was ahead of his time.  The world could end, I'd be under no strength.  I'd blast right off with my dangling.  Water out to all of you motherfuckers. 
[03:09:00]  About my best friend, those no-good truckers.  Ride down the road, carrying a load.  Feeling more sexy than a pregnant toe.  Checking out the scene on my CB.  Cause I don't want no bears fucking with me.  That's a big 10-4, good buddy.  Yeah.  Sounds like the Sugar Hill Gang.  You can just beat everything.  Yeah.  Smoking weed, feeling fine.  When suddenly I see a blue light behind.  Uh, call it dickhead.  Check out my crack.  Uh, think I got a bear on the back. 
[03:09:30]  She's on my ass.  It's about fucking trucking.  Yeah.  It's like a CB song.  10-4.  Oh, Whitey must have loved this song.  Please.  You think blacks like the fact that it was a trucker?  Yeah.  I'm proud of it.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  They stole that, huh?  Yup.  Sugar Hill stole that.  Mellie Mellie's known for that.  That's it.  Wow.  Wow.  Three.  Yeah.  Your mammy's a whore.  Ha.  Ha.  Wow.  Five.  Six.  Check out this dick. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  While going around the car.  Did he later, uh, go on to record Rock and Roll McDonald's?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You're absolutely sure the date is right on this?  Yeah.  I think my hands are large.  I cannot imagine this is 1965.  I'm gonna pull my trigger.  Absolutely.  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  Like, just the music behind it is ahead of its time.  I grabbed the bitch by the hand and hit it.  This is where Sugar Hill got their thing.  The tempo, the lyric, everything.  Yeah.  I sit on the bed and pull off my clothes as the funk on my foot.  Jimmy's gonna have this on his iPod by tonight.  It's cool.  I find that it all was a waste, cause that was a big prick staring me in the face.  I kicked it with my feet and hit it with my hand.  What I thought was a bitch was nothing but a man.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And you know what I did?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Now he's not.  Ha, ha, ha.  I said, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ooh. 
[03:11:00]  I said, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ah, and I got the hell out of there.  That's what I did.  Where's this guy talking to, we know?  So I grabbed my shit and got back in the truck.  And I thought to myself, what the fuck?  After messing up my days, spoiling my plans, I said to myself, I can still use my hands.  Thought about defining your hands.  You're gonna do it all day?  I couldn't help but to play with my bones.  Somebody's calling Bravo Sierra.  Hold on a minute here.  Ah, Bill in Kentucky.  Oh, morning, b-b-b-boy. 
[03:11:30]  Hey.  What's up?  How was this song from 1965?  Right.  When the first question you asked on the first, the first CD didn't come out until the, what,  the 80s?  Yeah.  He mentioned CD in the song?  Like, the fifth, like, the fifth line of his verse there was something about a CD.  CB, I bet.  I don't.  Rolling down the road in the CD.  CB.  CB.  It's the CB.  It's about truckers.  Oh, get out of here.  CB radio.  Oh, I can't believe I'm stupid.  Son of a bitch.  Oh, you're a fucking dope. 
[03:12:00]  Who drives in a CD?  Let me hear more of this, uh, Blowfly.  Derek's got something to add.  What do you have to add?  Yeah.  Besides good looks.  Wow, you're never in here.  I actually have this album on vinyl I'm bringing in next time I go home.  You do?  Ew.  Why do you have that?  It's a classic.  Is it?  Yeah, it's a bunch of.  You've heard of this song?  Yeah.  There's a song called Bitch Can I Come In Your Mouth, or Please Can I Come In Your Mouth.  Yeah, let me see the song titles here.  And there's a couple other ones.  Track listing.  Wow.  Is he dead, this guy?  I don't know.  No, they have a picture on his website.  Oh, they've got to see it.  Older than dirt.  Shake your ass. 
[03:12:30]  He's got to be old.  Track listing.  Shake your ass.  Funky party.  Whole man, clean up woman.  Medley.  Rap dirty.  Porno freak.  I've got to be free.  Who did I eat last night?  Too fat to fuck.  First black president.  Girl, I think come in your mouth.  Zodiac blowfly.  Come of a lifetime.  Rotten fish.  That's what your pussy's made for.  And blowfly's ABCs.  I can only imagine what that's about.  Fucking blowfly. 
[03:13:00]  He's a hundred.  He is a hundred.  Look how old this guy is.  Blowfly can just sit there angry as a motherfucker, yelling.  That was my motherfucking shit.  You took my shit, motherfucker.  Blowfly in DC, circa 2005.  Can we go back to the song or?  Can we get him on the phone?  I want to hear a little more.  How long is this song, by the way, Derek?  White man took everything from him.  All right.  Ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it at her.  Let me tell you something.  41 years ago, he did the first rap song. 
[03:13:30]  That's fucking amazing.  It really is amazing.  It really is.  41 years ago.  Why was there such a gap between then and?  And when rap became kind of even popular.  Language pride.  How could you play that anywhere?  We were able to keep them down.  Yeah?  The white man?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Kept their boot heel on him?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Like, we can't let this get out.  I'll bet you they did this to the community and then finally someone recorded it.  Yeah.  Dozens and stuff.  I know all about black people.  Do you?  I certainly do.  All right. 
[03:14:00]  N.W.A. stole from that song?  Did they?  I don't know.  Everybody stole from that song.  It's a fucking rap song.  Absolutely.  Can we hear just another piece of that?  Got back in the truck and I thought to myself, what the fuck?  After messing up my day and spoiling my plans, I said to myself, I can still use my hands.  Thought about the fine bitch of head back home and suddenly I couldn't help but to play  with my bones.  Yeah.  While riding to the state of...  Iron the shirt.  Now I'm an intern. 
[03:14:30]  I sleep in a coffin of dirt.  I went in his bar and said, what the heck?  Motherfucker no good ring.  I'm running out there.  Some asshole at the end of the bar said, hey, nigga boy, do you know who you are?  Daddy, let's shoot this fucker.  I know you motherfuckers can't kick my ass.  I remember what my daddy said one night.  He said, niggas' freaks is bigger than white.  But my black ass was in for a big surprise because that cracker's dick was three times my size.  And of course, you know, that isn't a big 10-4.  I said, bitch, don't y'all fail me now. 
[03:15:00]  We gotta play this on CBS.  Is this gangsta fag?  Everyone rip this guy off.  I said, boys, don't kick your ass till your head turn blue.  There ain't nothing I hate's worse than a nigger or a Jew.  I said, are you sure you wanna fuck with me?  I'm a distant cousin to Muhammad Ali.  Suddenly his big freak began to shrink.  He said, come on, boy, let's have a drink.  Those rednecks in the corner start getting up out of their seats,  carrying big gloves, wearing white jeans.  He said, listen, nigga man, I'm the grand dragon of the Klu Klux Klan.  You say, there's no nigger better than me. 
[03:15:30]  Motherfuck you and Muhammad Ali.  I threw my drink in his face and I started to run as I built the lid from his shotgun.  I got in my rig and covered up my face and I drew my truck through that motherfucking place.  I started to run with glass in the hair and the cracker's ass was flying everywhere.  The grand dragon was on the ground with his ass blurted.  When did Muhammad Ali change his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali?  I know, I was thinking that too.  He might have re-recorded this.  It doesn't sound like, I'm talking the basic background music doesn't sound like 65. 
[03:16:00]  Like that shit is Beatles revolutionary.  You know, and like the Beatles were going, you know, I want to hold your hat.  And this guy's got all kinds of funk shit going on in the background and keyboards and that can't be 65.  I'm just saying that can't, the quality alone.  He was Cassius Clay in the early 60s. 
[03:16:30]  I think he became Muhammad Ali.  Blow Fly's Disco Party.  Wait, what's the name of the song again?  Rap Dirty.  This shit ain't no fucking 65, motherfucker.  Kiss my black ass, you don't believe that motherfucker.  Well, he did a Christmas song too.  Where's that Christmas song?  Go back again.  Rap Dirty.  Rap Dirty.  Rap Dirty.  Alright.  Maybe they didn't take him seriously because he was, you know. 
[03:17:00]  Filthy.  Filthy.  Maybe 75.  Oh, he had it.  That's the whole fucking trucker thing.  He had a song called Queer for a New Year and Jingle Fucking Bells.  Jingle Fucking Bells.  Wow, we're into the Blow Fly, huh?  That's pretty cool.  Alright, we'll have to find out more about Blow Fly.  Yeah, Derek, I'd actually like to see that album.  Yeah.  Bill in Pennsylvania.  Hey, guys.  Hello, Bill. 
[03:17:30]  What's up?  What up, Bill?  How the hell are you this fine Wednesday morning where it's fucking raining up the ass?  Quickly, Bill.  You're losing us, Bill.  Come on, Bill.  What's up, Bill?  I know, I know.  Hey, listen.  This is a totally cool bit that y'all were doing here.  But you need to tell whoever's writing your damn pad data this morning to check their fucking spelling.  What did Dummy do this time?  Nosferatu.  How did he spell it? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, we know when we were doing the thing.  How did he spell it?  The way I understand it, you spell it N-O-S-F-O-R-A-T-U.  How did Derek spell it?  And they spelled it N-O-S-F-O-R-A-T-U.  Nosferatu, you dumbbell.  It was Danny.  It was Danny.  Alright, thank you, sir.  And I thought...  Uh, Dave in Arizona.  Dracula.  Hey, boys, what's up?  Hey, Dave.  Hey, man. 
[03:18:30]  That is not 65.  No.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I had to call in.  No.  He's doing trucker stuff.  I don't even think there was a CB radio back in 65.  Yeah, I know.  The cops talked on CB.  It was 65.  I don't think...  Hey, and by the way, that guy from Pennsylvania said, y'all, what the hell was that?  I don't know.  That's a nice caller.  You know what?  I think maybe he just updated the song or something.  Maybe that's not the original from 1965.  Yeah, because all the lingo and stuff, the trucker lingo...  That sounds like something that would have been out around the same time as Sugar Hill Gang. 
[03:19:00]  75.  You're saying the version we have might not be the original version.  The version, yeah.  It might be an updated version for the disco 70s.  But the words would have been different, too, because he's talking trucker shit, and that really wasn't...  Maybe he changed a little bit.  Yeah.  Maybe he updated it in the 70s or after Sugar Hill Gang.  All right, we've got to move on, because we've got Norm Crosby on the Jerry Lewis elathon.  Oh, great.  That I want to hear.  Real fast.  Jim in Georgia.  Jim?  Hey, the CB lingo is all wrong for 65. 
[03:19:30]  65 was bubblegum machines and seat covers.  70s was Smokey Bear and sweaters.  The CB lingo is all wrong, so thanks for putting me on, guys.  Okay.  Well, we're going to have to get more info on that.  Okay.  Bring in the other...  Well, we don't have a freaking record player on here.  Why don't we get him on the phone?  Can we get him on the phone?  I'd love to talk to Blowfly.  Okay.  First double album, that was Blonde on Blonde by Bob Dylan. 
[03:20:00]  1970.  First rock star to choke on his own vomit.  Jimi Hendrix.  There you go.  This was an interesting one.  Also from 1970.  First heavy metal song to Hail Satan.  To Hail Satan?  Were they going to say NIB?  Good.  I don't know.  Is it Sabbath?  No, it shouldn't be.  I said NIB would have been misinterpretation. 
[03:20:30]  Many people cite Blowfly as being the first rapper with his 1965 Rap Dirty record, which  was re-recorded for Disco Giants TK Records after the smash success of Sugar Hill Gang's  Rapper's Delight.  Good call, man.  So Blowfly ripped off Sugar Hill Gang.  Good call.  Sounds just like Sugar Hill.  Motherfucking Blowfly.  Who came up with this, E-Rock?  Who's telling Fred?  Travis.  Oh, Travis.  Look at that.  Travi.  Wow.  Wow.  I'll pick it. 
[03:21:00]  What was the original like?  That's why I want to hear the original.  Well, now we got to hear the original.  There ain't no copies of that shit.  And very good, by the way.  That shit ratted away or something.  Very good.  Very good.  Well, he's got the album for one year, though.  What a creepy kid Derek must have been.  No kidding.  With his open-toed shoes listening to that.  It's open-toed.  Thanks to Anthony, though.  He figured it out.  It was way ahead of its time.  Oh, okay.  When you nailed it with the Beatles.  Sounded wrong.  First heavy metal song to Hail Satan, 1970.  What band? 
[03:21:30]  I don't want to say, Jimmy.  I just don't want to say.  What's that?  I'm sorry.  I was...  First heavy metal song to Hail...  Are they going to say it's Black Sabbath?  The song Black Sabbath?  Whatever they say of it's Sabbath, it's misinterpretation.  So it's...  It was Black Sabbath with the song Black Sabbath.  Yeah, it's wrong.  Why?  Because it's not a hailing Satan at all.  It's hailing Satan.  Oh, it's not.  It's a warning against Black magic.  That's what it holds the whole...  That's what you people use to defend.  No, he's scared of the devil.  He's saying, what is this that stands before me?  A figure in black? 
[03:22:00]  He's scared of it.  Which points at me.  Yeah, but you know, when you conjure up Satan, you're going to be scared.  Regardless.  Oh, stop it.  You're going to sit there and conjure him up, but then when he appears, you're going to  be scared.  Doesn't mean you aren't kind of, you know, calling him.  Right or wrong?  Right.  That's the answer.  He'll tell you.  We're in the hail part.  Is this the end, my friends?  Satan's coming around the bend?  People running because they're scared?  What is this that stands before me?  It doesn't sound like Ozzy. 
[03:22:30]  Wow, I thought Ozzy was in the studio for a second.  A figure in black which points at me.  I don't like when people sing Ozzy.  Sounds like Alfa singing.  Turn around quick and start to run.  Find out I'm a chosen one.  All right.  I hate this song.  Jimmy, don't jerk off.  Jesus.  It's not praising Satan.  So that question's wrong.  So this list stinks because we don't have the good Blowfly song either.  All right.  Here's one. 
[03:23:00]  First, here's an item.  Poshumus.  Poshumus?  Poshumus.  He's kidding.  First, the fan whispers it.  First, Poshumus.  Poshumus.  Number one hit.  This guy recorded the song three days later.  Dead!  Otis Redding.  Jim Croce.  Son of a bitch.  Jimmy got another one right.  It's the song that got me into a radio too.  What?  Yeah.  Oh yeah, OJ.  Oh yeah.  Remember?  He did die three days after he recorded this. 
[03:23:30]  Three days later.  Three days.  What did he die of?  Plane crash.  Oops.  I guess he was one of those.  Fall fly every day for 19,000 years.  Yeah, right?  First rock album with printed lyrics.  What year?  1967.  1967.  Oh.  Pink Floyd.  I have no idea.  Wait a minute.  Beatles.  Yep.  Oh, White Album.  Sergeant Pepper.  Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club. 
[03:24:00]  All right.  Band singing along.  First rapper nominated for an Oscar.  Wait.  2002.  Oh yeah.  We're pretty much done.  No, wait.  Little Caesar, who cares?  Eminem?  A little Caesar?

He plays off that deaf thing, right?  I don't know what he does.  Is he really deaf?  He's supposed to be hard of hearing, so he gets words wrong and stuff, and that was part  of his shtick.  We saw him at the Donald Trump roast.  Oh, bomb.  We did a whole bit on that.  Yeah, because he came out, and there weren't any real...  He used his standard jokes. 
[03:25:00]  He was like, hey, Donald Trump does a lot of construction.  You know, there's a construction site, and this guy goes out for lunch, and he brings  back some sandwiches, and he goes into like a joke.  Hey, that's Donald Trump.  He flies a lot.  There was an airplane pilot, and he says to his co-pilot, what the...  And it had nothing to do with Trump.  It's Trump roast.  He was smooth as silk.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get into it next.  Boobs always bring this show to a hall.  Oh, screeching hall.

I'm sorry  Rockin' in the free world  Keep on rockin' in the free world  Rockin' in the USA 
[03:27:30]  It was a bad kiss song  Rockin' in the free world  Alright, Norm Crosby, everybody  Let's get to some  Nyam Crosby  Nyam Crosby  From the Jerry Lewis telethon  So you know it's gotta be good  We wanted to do this yesterday  Jerry's intro starts it off  I am about to introduce somebody  But I don't know who it is  Because I can't read the teleprompter  Oh, boy  But it's okay  I'll just  I'll just fill from it 
[03:28:00]  Yeah  It's Norm Crosby who's coming out, sir  What is it?  Norm Crosby, I'm ready  Oh, is that who I'm introducing?  Yes, sir  Well, he'll have to wait  Why is that?  This man, ladies and gentlemen  Is  I think he's doing his 23rd telethon  Is he really 80?  I've been there every time I've come to him  And not only does he arrive  But he delivers  Jerry Lewis sounds like a woman 
[03:28:30]  Mr. Norm Crosby, ladies and gentlemen  Right here  Right here  Right here  Ladies and gentlemen  Right here  What happened to  Is he really 80 now?  He's old  Now he's just old  We can't make fun of him  Yeah, we can  Comedians live a long fucking time  If they don't overdose  Well, it's all the laughter  Laughter's very healthy  Ah, the best medicine  They say  There's something to do with stress release  I think with that  That helps  Because you die 
[03:29:00]  You're either doing drugs in your 30s  Or you're fucking 85 years old  Yeah  Look at stupid Groucho  And all those guys, man  Bob Hope  The ancient  He sounded like a woman  Yeah  What happened to the old  Buddy Love sound  Of the nutty professor  That's 50 years old now  Remember that?  When he was Buddy Love  And he turned into the cool guy  And he played the piano  That old black magic  And now it's like  Hey, what's coming out?  Who's coming out?  Norm Crosby's gonna have to wait  What the hell is that? 
[03:29:30]  His voice is changing again  Thank God Dino's dead  Do you live to a ripe old age  Where you get to see your voice change again?  Your voice changes again  Yeah  Time to change  Oh, his diaper  Here we go  Here's Norm Crosby  Isn't that nice  To walk out to that kind of an ovulation?  God bless you  Oh, boy  See, that's his whole schtick  You know, I want to take a  That's his schtick  Wordplay  Is that he gets all the words wrong  Because he's deaf  And he's never heard him right 
[03:30:00]  So he screws up all the words  But he makes believe  It's a scream  But he makes believe  He's saying the right words  Probably  It's literally a scream  Do you have the other one, too?  That's the only one we have so far  Can we get one more out of him before we leave?  Maybe we could have him do one live here  Yeah, all right  Here we go  Isn't that nice  To walk out to that kind of an ovulation? 
[03:30:30]  God bless you  You know, I want to take a minute to thank Jerry  And to thank MDA for this telethon  Because as much as MDA needs our help  We need this telethon to make us feel good about ourselves  Don't you understand that the lunacy  The lust and the humping that goes on in the world  I mean it  Hurricanes and phony confessions  And terrible things that are happening in the world  Do you realize how many people in Florida  Suffered from the storm 
[03:31:00]  Premature evacuation?  All those people  Hello, exactly!  Hello, exactly!  What the fuck is this idiot talking about?  Oh, no  Yeah, oh, it's just bad  He's an older man  He's an older gentleman  He's doing a good thing  I don't care, he stinks  I give a lot of love to older guys  Older comics that did it in the Copa  And all these tough gigs  But  I don't know 
[03:31:30]  After a certain point  You have to get beyond  It's all right  Because no one was watching anyway  Wordplay  Like  Nice to come out to that kind of ovulation  And it's like  Do you understand that in 76  Yeah  Prior to an album called Bicentennial Nigger  Which talked about like Black Plight  And  It's  30 something years later  And you're still doing  Nice to have that ovulation  Ovulation  You have to kind of change a little  No 
[03:32:00]  He didn't  He was old back then  It's so good to be back in Las Vegas  I mean  At this town  Those of us know  Who come here a lot  Used to come here a lot  But  There's no bias here  There's no prejudice  There's no bigotry in Las Vegas  I mean  Either you have money  Or you don't have money  That's it  But there's no bigotry  I had a pain in my groin today  I don't know where I got it  I mean it  I was picking up some paper  But  I went to the health club 
[03:32:30]  I said to the lady there  Excuse me  How much would you charge  To massage the genitals  She said  Same as the Jews  I don't care  They don't care  They don't care  I don't think I was  Getting away with that material  On a telethon  Little kids are watching  Massage the genitals  That's a good joke  That ain't bad  Yeah  I mean  That's a good old  Casual type of vibe  Yeah  As much as the Jews  Some people don't get it  Do you know  There is more money  Being spent right now  On breast implants 
[03:33:00]  And Viagra  Than on Alzheimer's research  Do you know what that means  That means by the year 2040  There will be a large  Elderly population  With big boobs  And huge erections  Who will have absolutely  No idea  Of what to do with them  He's working a little blue  He's killing  Yeah that's not a bad joke  That ain't bad  For an older man  For an old codger  Yeah again 
[03:33:30]  You know  Hey Jerry  That's fine  Whatever  It's no  God bless  It's no  Wino meets Dracula  Off of  That nigger's crazy  Right  But  No offense to the intern  Me quoting that bit  Or Danny  That is true  We have that in the studio  Let's say hi to Pete
