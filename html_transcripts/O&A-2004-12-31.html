<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a visit from "Master Poe," a martial arts expert who’d received various cleaning supplies from a listener.  The hosts joked about the gifts’ intended use, a conversation fueled by a call with Peter, vice president of a janitorial supply company.  This segued into discussions about the show's security guard, humorous hypothetical confrontations, and a reminiscence of a twelve-second celebrity (Tito Ortiz) sparring match involving Steve.  Voss then entered, promoting his new, minimalist-cover DVD, leading to more banter and a clumsy karate demonstration critiqued by Master Poe, followed by a more serious self-defense demonstration by Master Poe and his student, Marcelino. The segment included several XM Radio advertisements.

The show then shifted to a discussion about Rich Voss's experiences on *Last Comic Standing*, including his negative assessment of season three and  his past struggles with cocaine and crack addiction.  John Heffron, a fellow *Last Comic Standing* contestant, joined the discussion.  A mystery substance with a foul odor was sniffed by several people in studio, prompting strong reactions.  The segment included numerous jokes and offensive remarks, including racist language, and ended with humorous anecdotes, including one about a whale-watching trip.

Next, a highly offensive and sexually explicit phone call with Krista, a blind woman, took place.  The hosts and Krista engaged in graphic sexual banter and disability-related jokes using her screen reader. Opie then recounted a disastrous fireplace incident with "Java Logs" involving a friend, Jay. The segment also featured XM Radio commercials, a discussion mocking a song about Lacey Peterson, a preview of Opie and Anthony's “Fun House,” and a news story about a naked man bitten by a police dog. The segment ended with a cliffhanger about Opie’s dog, Chester’s liver.

The show continued with Opie discussing his year living with his ex-mother-in-law and accidentally breaking her belongings, along with the story of Chester, the dog's sudden death and Anthony carrying the dog upstairs.  A caller offered to fight Master Poe for a MyFive, leading to a tense and humorous confrontation where Master Poe revealed his litigation history.  Richard Cheese was mentioned as an upcoming guest. A call with sex expert Shannon Mullen, author of "The Best You'll Ever Have," ensued, featuring discussions about the G-spot, P-spot, sexual myths, sex toys, and humorous anecdotes.

The final segment featured Shannon Mullen as a guest, fielding explicit caller questions about various sexual topics including "tushalingus," "donkey sausage," gag reflexes during oral sex, prison sex, and interpreting unusual sexual encounters.  The hosts engaged in sexually explicit jokes and commentary.  Technical difficulties with Christmas music were briefly noted.  Shannon abruptly ended several calls before the show concluded. A call from Little Jimmy's mother, concerned about his visits to prostitutes, was played, prompting discussion of alternative activities.  Bernie Goetz's upcoming appearance was also promoted.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Some people don't like you to mention certain things. 
[00:07:00]  Some people don't want you to say this.  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things, they might happen.  Some people are really fucking stupid.  Hit me.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, Master Poe came in.  Where is all that stuff that Master Poe brought in?  You want to get Master Poe in here?  Master Poe comes in with...  Or is he trying to get rid of more bloody geese?  Sprays?  Jesus.  And lotions and hand sanitizers. 
[00:07:30]  This must be the guy that brought all that stuff in, right?  Here it is.  Oh, here it is.  All right.  Here comes Master Poe into the studio, Anthony.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, Master Poe.  Look at the yellow...  Yellow...  This song gets you pumped.  It does.  I feel like I could get in the crane position and kick some young blonde boy in the face.  And then just rub him and make him feel better.  Yeah!  Master Poe, so this guy Peter stopped by yesterday? 
[00:08:00]  He's on the line, I think.  Yes, I am.  Oh, okay.  I didn't get the card.  What's the card?  It's for all your janitorial needs.  You need Enterprises.  He's the vice president.  Smells good, actually.  And I thought it was some kook that was just sending up sprays and stuff.  He sent us up deodorizing spray for Jimmy's ass.  Whenever Jim...  Well, we have the Lysol.  Is that...  Yeah, we have... 
[00:08:30]  But here's some Orchard Spice Spray if you need it.  Okay.  It's an odor neutralizer.  Great.  The hair stuff smells good, the Gojo.  What is this?  Okay.  Luxury foam hair and body wash.  Smell it.  It smells really good.  It's like girly, but it's nice.  What do you do with that stuff?  Ooh.  Isn't that lovely?  What do you do with the Gojo?  Sir?  Oh, my God.  Peter.  And yes?  Peter.  What do you do with the Gojo?  I think he was on a cell phone that didn't work. 
[00:09:00]  Oh.  Well, I guess you use this if you're working in...  Maybe you work in a garage and you get a little oil on you and regular products don't take it off that easy.  Yeah, but Gojo has always been this product.  I used to use it when I was on the job site just for my hands.  But it takes grease and oil off of you.  So I guess this guy's figuring we're changing engines in Chevy Novas here in the studio.  And just in case we need that.  But it does smell nice.  I sure like that.  I wouldn't mind lathering someone up with it.  Now, do you want to keep the stuff from Peter?  Because you yelled at Master Poe. 
[00:09:30]  I didn't yell at Master Poe.  Don't.  I would never yell at Master Poe.  I want to make that absolutely clear, Master Poe.  I would never yell at you.  I don't know.  Don't start.  I don't know about that.  What?  I think when Master Poe left the studio, you had some things to say to Master Poe.  I was.  That you said to the door after he left.  Don't even.  Fuck.  Don't even.  What?  What are you talking about?  I'm not even making eye contact with Master Poe. 
[00:10:00]  You know me, Master Poe.  Anthony.  I would never, ever say anything that would disrespect you.  Hmm.  Never.  You sure you didn't say anything as he was bringing all that stuff out of the studio?  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  You're an idiot.  He's trying to start something that isn't there.  He's trying to instigate, huh?  I said nothing.  I'd just like to see you sweat.  I am sweating.  Do you think I want Master Poe to take out retribution on me for something I never did? 
[00:10:30]  Honestly, I've...  Peter back in line.  We don't need Peter again.  No, thank you for the sprays and bumps and whatnot.  Honestly, Anthony is so polite to Master Poe, it's not even funny.  Of course.  He's a nice guy.  And he could kill with a look.  You pick your words perfectly when you're around Master Poe.  Master Poe came in.  He had the sprays and stuff.  He goes, a listener sent these for you.  It's for Jim's ass and stuff.  And I'm going, why are listeners sending stuff like this?  We don't know where it came from.  We have a can of Lysol for Jimmy's ass. 
[00:11:00]  And we don't really need anything else.  And then he showed me some hand sanitizer.  You ever see this stuff?  You just put it in your hand.  You don't need water or anything.  You rub it around.  That's what I thought that might be.  Well, we do have some of that too.  Right, Master Poe?  Oh, he brought some of that.  Yes, yes.  I think it's in here or something.  Oh, can I use a little for my hands?  To clear this up, Opie was telling me about the situation concerning the guard downstairs.  And I thought that was more important than soap.  Yeah, there you go.  So I gave you the information.  I told you that Eric has the card.  If you're interested, by all means, speak to him. 
[00:11:30]  Okay.  I wanted to make sure.  Are you going to kick the guard's ass for us?  No, I will not do that.  However, I'll make sure that he doesn't yell anymore.  When do you get to kick ass?  When someone hits you first?  No, when someone comes in and physically goes towards me.  That's what I mean.  Well, he's not hitting me.  No, he doesn't hit him.  He's not one of those hit me first guys.  Right.  You're saying get in the vicinity and attempt it and you're going to get your neck snapped.  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  You can pretty much tell from a guy's look if he's going to be aggressive with you, right?  It's body language and also their eyes. 
[00:12:00]  You want to see exactly what they're about.  Dude, we'll work together.  If he's looking you up and down, looking to scope out where he's going to hit you, you  can pick that up in a second.  We'll work together.  I'll cover up the security cameras.  You do a number on him and then I'll vouch for you and say that he attacked you first.  That he fell down in a drunken stupor on the floor.  Well, we can do that.  Slipped on Ben's coffee in the elevator.  We can do that or Anthony can assist me in a self-defense demonstration.  No, never.  I'd like to see that.  It would never happen.  I would lay there and just let you do what you will. 
[00:12:30]  Steve will do it.  Why do I have to do this?  That would be one of the things.  That was one of the best things ever on the old show.  Who did you take on?  Tito Ortiz.  And it wasn't really taking on.  Who did I get knocked out by?  Remember Tito Ortiz?  Ultimate fighting champ.  Right.  And we thought it would be great if Steve took him on.  Just to see how long Steve could actually go with the guy.  Kind of like riding a bull.  Yeah, riding a bull.  How long could you stay on a bull?  So we said, Steve, take on Tito Ortiz.  And how long did you last? 
[00:13:00]  12 seconds.  Was it that long?  Well, the thing is this.  I remember you just going down.  Yeah, it was 12 seconds.  And he wasn't trying to hurt you.  Yeah, exactly.  And that's the thing.  If you fight back, this guy could snap your neck.  And you have to sort of make a judgment call.  Do you fight back, punch him in the face, and risk him tearing your eyes out of your head?  And that's the thing.  If I go up against him, he knows more kung fu.  Steve, that was the day, though.  All kidding aside, I knew you were the real deal.  So, I mean, who in their right mind would take him on, even in a fake fight? 
[00:13:30]  And Steve was trying.  Like, he was trying to stay up.  And it was, I don't know, it was like watching the mighty Kong fall off of the building.  Yeah, that was when I was 120 pounds heavier, too.  He jumped on my back.  Were you that much heavier?  Oh, yeah.  It was before his surgery, right?  And he jumped on my back.  The second I went for it, I did one half-assed wrestling move, took his leg out.  In the time that it took me to take his leg out, he was on my back, had me in a sleeper hold,  and I could feel my consciousness leak.  Conscious?  Consciousness.  Are those?  Consciousness.  Consciousness.  How much did he weigh? 
[00:14:00]  He's a big boy.  He's big, though, right?  Tito, he's not a small guy.  230, probably.  And he just has those techniques, those grappling techniques, where he can tie you up to where  you're just not going to move, and then put a little sleeper hold on you, and you're  done.  You guys see, there's a documentary, you might have seen it, called Choke.  It's about...  The Yankees this year?  No?  No.  Yeah, Hicks and Gracie was in it.  Yes, it's also the Petersons.  Choke and swim.  Yeah, about Hicks and Gracie.  Hoist Gracie.  No, this is Hicks and his older brother. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  But they say he's actually a better fighter.  The whole Gracie family is crazy.  Yeah.  Are those sleeper holds for real?  Yes.  I thought that was just the blood off to your head.  I thought that was just like an old wrestling fake move.  Well, they do the fake sleeper holds in WWF.  They show one guy, a little Asian guy, who's probably about 140 pounds, beating this guy  who was probably 250.  Because the guy picked him up by his arm.  The little Asian man was hanging on the arm of the other man like a kid, but he did something  with his legs, and he locked the guy's arm, and the guy just patted immediately.  Because he was about to have his arm snap by a 150-pound guy. 
[00:15:00]  They can tie you up with their body, and then they start putting a little pressure on a  leg or an arm where you've got to tap out.  You know, it's broken.  Right.  Or it's going to be broken.  I've watched those Ultimate Wrestling things where they do snap people's arms.  What?  Oh, God.  What?  Jimmy pulled his pants down, and he's showing his ass to Voss out the window.  And what is Voss writing on that piece of paper?  Voss thought all of a sudden it was a mirror when he looked into it and saw an ass. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, it's a piece of paper that says, I love you, Jim.  All right.  Oh, that was funny.  In 15 seconds, he's really going to laugh.  He needs attention.  We'll get him in here in a few minutes.  All right, Master Paul.  He thought it was a mirror.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you.  I want to see you give a demonstration, though, someday, because Voss took karate.  He actually did take karate.  Oh, that's right.  He brags about it sometimes.  Voss, come in here.  What style of karate?  I'm not sure.  He probably doesn't even know.  Listen to karate.  Yes, pronounce karate.  All right, Voss, get over here.  Look at you.  Rich.  That's a solid ass. 
[00:16:00]  Did you sleep in your car?  Look at that DVD.  I slept for two hours around the corner at my manager's house.  I cannot believe you went with Spinal Tap's idea for your DVD.  Is that Spinal Tap?  Is that Spinal Tap's idea?  Oh, yeah.  I catch the Black Album.  First of all, let me explain this.  I actually like it.  This is Voss, not Spinal Tap.  Okay, this is a collective sentiment.  I'm just saying that Spinal Tap did the same thing, the Black Album.  Did they really?  Yeah, they were like, the Beatles had the White Album, we'll have the Black Album.  No, I went with the Chicago theme, like Voss 1, Voss 2. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, is that it?  I mean, I think it ever gets a two-team year.  Like Chicago, right, the band?  Yeah.  And plus, it's easier to spell.  That is true.  What am I going to do with Voss?  It says Voss and white lettering, and it's on black.  You don't want to pay for printing, obviously.  No, I can pay.  When you go to a record store, dummies, when you put something out that's sellable, it's  called the 10-foot rule in a record store.  And if you can see from over 10-foot ones.  Are you giving marketing tips the 10-foot rule?  Yeah, I'm giving marketing tips.  Is that how you decide who you're going to blow in a rest area? 
[00:17:00]  Yes.  I look into this, and I'll ask myself, how much more black could it be?  And the answer is none.  None more black.  But you know what?  If you open it up and you see the second thank you, then you will see...  Who's the first?  Who's the first?  Yeah.  Who is the first thank you?  Jim Norton, I think, is the first.  Aw.  Oh, all right.  No, I don't think...  I don't know.  Maybe that's under friends.  Open up the brand new Voss DVD to see who he thanks first.  It's black.  It's black.  It's a cool cover.  It just says Voss and white.  But I don't like the way the DVD symbol in white is on the top left.  Yeah, we're taking that off. 
[00:17:30]  Why is that?  You know what?  I didn't print them.  Here's the thing.  We're going to take it off on the next one.  Oh, special thanks to...  Caroline's Comedy Club is first.  Oh, okay.  Opie and Anthony.  There you go.  Caroline just helped you more than Opie and Anthony.  No, no.  It's just a...  Well, you know...  Last Comic Standing is third.  All right.  And then it really drops off.  Really?  Why aren't Opie and Anthony under friends, though?  Where's...  Huh?  Why aren't Opie and Anthony under friends?  Oh, that's right.  We're under special thanks.  And friends, Jimmy Norton's first. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, look at that.  To my awful friends.  And then Patrice, Keith, Florentine...  There you go.  Colin again.  Colin made both.  He's a professional and a friend.  You know what?  And we're just professionals.  No, yeah, but you know what?  It would have looked too gay if I would have put you guys twice.  It looks gay no matter what you put, Rich.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  So, Rich, you know karate?  No.  Oh, is that what I used to when I was like 20 years ago?  Why?  Well, because Master Poe knows a little karate.  Why?  Oh, did you bring me here to get my ass whooped again? 
[00:18:30]  What's wrong with you guys?  I'm not your goddamn punching bag.  I'm not your signboy.  Yeah, I used to.  We just wanted a little demonstration.  That's all.  Steve doesn't want to demonstrate today.  What style of karate?  Ugh.  Oh, Jesus.  First of all, you didn't talk that way when I walked in, okay?  You said, I'm pleased to see you, and I'm glad I have a job.  Wow.  Master Poe, you hear that?  Master Poe.  I want to make sure you heard that.  Okay, yeah, Mr. Poe, Master Security. 
[00:19:00]  I wouldn't fuck with Master Poe.  That's a bad lie.  I wouldn't fuck with him.  I'm making up the Poe remarks.  Dude, the other day he told a story that he had to get rid of a bloody gee in a dumpster  at five in the morning.  Yeah, really?  He came up with a story that it was about a...  What did he do with the little girl?  Well, we don't know.  He told a story, and quite frankly, Norton and I, we're not sure if we want to believe  it or not.  We want to believe that it was...  Norton had to get rid of a bloody he a couple of weeks ago.  I want to watch Poe be head-washed with his own awful DVD. 
[00:19:30]  Don't like a Chinese star.  It's like an odd job with a hat.  It just goes right through his neck.  Man killed by a mediocre DVD.  First of all...  I'm kidding.  No, the material's great.  You're staring at me like that because you're making me very uncomfortable.  Oh, he's a scary guy.  Look at him.  First of all...  Very scary guy.  His name is Master Poe.  What style?  Yeah?  I never heard of...  No, what style have you taken?  Okinawan Kenpo Karate, Shotokan Karate, Shinru Karate?  What form?  I took Taekwondo, which is kind of like gay street karate, right? 
[00:20:00]  Gay street karate?  Gay street karate.  That's a Korean style.  I kick them and then I lick them.  That's funny.  You've got to use that on stage, man.  I got tons of stuff.  I'm always on fire.  All right.  Here's the thing.  Why don't you just do a little demonstration?  He's going to help kill me.  Why?  I don't want to see Voss.  Got that right.  I can't get asked.  Did you tell him what happened the last time I kicked?  How about the last time he did a kick?  Well, this is true.  I forgot.  I was dating this British girl and we're outside of a sushi place. 
[00:20:30]  Really good place.  And Voss is like, I took karate.  So we're like, all right, let's see a kick.  So we're standing there and Rich goes to do a straight kick and he slips in garbage juice  and he falls right on his back on the middle of 11th Street, Greenwich Street.  I got a quick kick.  I haven't done it in 20 years and I got a herniated disc and I can still kick.  But he'd kill me.  Let's see a kick at least.  At least see me kick?  Yeah, let's set up over here.  Not by him.  Here.  Let's set up a Voss kick.  I don't want to see Voss kick.  And then Master Pope can maybe critique it a little bit.  I don't want to see Voss get hurt. 
[00:21:00]  Nathaniel will do a karate demonstration.  Does Nathaniel do karate?  Do some moves.  Actually, Nathaniel studies the art of jiu-jitsu.  Does he?  Yes, he does.  How long have you been taking it?  About two years.  Okay.  Two years?  Karate?  That's respectable.  Jiu-jitsu.  All right.  Who do you want to take on, Voss?  Because when someone talks about your hair, you know how to fight them now?  Oh, my God.  You're a mess.  He's got the thinnest hair.  You're like 14.  Why don't you go like Norton to shave it all off and look presentable?  Instead of just like a walking wreck.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[00:21:30]  Dude, your jeans are too tight to try and kick.  Oh, my God.  He's going to kick a nut right into his stomach.  His nut's going to pop out of his pants.  Please don't fall.  Do the camera.  Please don't.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  So embarrassing.  I've never seen a midget.  Ow!  I've never seen a midget trying a karate kick before.  What's that here?  Dude.  That's not bad.  Hold on.  Considering Voss is 58.  That's not bad if you're going to be kicking kindergartners in the head.  What are you doing?  First of all, I'm just saying. 
[00:22:00]  I'm out of breath.  He's out of breath.  Your feet have the lift of a tank.  Listen, if I stretch, man, why am I out of breath after three kicks?  Because you just threw a kick in pants that are too tight for you.  There's no reason to be kicking in those pants.  Why are you wearing the tight pants, man?  I'm uncomfortable now.  I'm uncomfortable for you.  Someone give Voss a scrunchie and socks to pull up over them.  That's scrunchie. 
[00:22:30]  Master Poe, what did you think of his moves?  He wasn't placing his hip into the kick.  But again, he hasn't practiced in how many years?  There you go.  Hold on.  How many years?  Later tonight.  Oh.  That wasn't bad.  No, he just hurt himself.  No, he didn't.  Oh, you look like you hurt yourself.  Okay.  Later tonight on OpenAnthony.com.  Stop with your nuts in those pants.  We have video of Voss kicking.  That was a good kick, though.  That wasn't bad.  That wasn't bad.  That was a bad kick at all.  That wasn't bad.  That would hurt.  Breathe.  Jesus. 
[00:23:00]  Does anybody have any primatee masks on them?  I'm sure glad you're taking care of that cigarette habit.  You've got to go smoking.  You've really got to stop smoking.  I am going to quit.  Master Pog.  Hey, you know who?  I want to see Master Pog.  Is Heffron coming in?  Is Heffron coming in?  I think so.  I thought he was coming in with you.  Oh, yeah.  He's a martial artist, too.  He's like an Israeli.  There he is right there.  He's like an Israeli.  All the comics.  All the comics love the Kung Fu.  Not me.  That's because we're scared of our audiences.  Yes, I used to be really good in Taiwondo years ago.  But no master crap, you know. 
[00:23:30]  You know, we just fought.  Master Voss.  Yeah.  Master Voss.  I like that.  Oh, my.  The karate midget.  Are your legs in pain?  No, his whole body's in pain.  Look at him.  He's turning red.  I'm a little out of shape.  I'm in good shape, like, on the outside.  I'll say you are.  On the outside, like, my...  Yeah, nothing was better than you and Carrot Top taking your shirts off on the...  Oh, yeah?  Did you drop a badge on your stomach watching that one?  You know, when I think Carrot Top, I'm not thinking beefcake display. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, look at those two guys who are working.  Is that what you did?  That was pretty much me.  Look at them.  Oh, they got a job.  Look at those employed hotties.  So what can we do with Voss and Master Paul?  Is that good?  Not bad.  How old am I?  Hmm.  Forty-two?  Forty-seven.  Okay.  Forty-seven.  So you got a six-pack.  He looks good for 47.  How old am I?  How old are you?  Mm-hmm.  Old enough to get a real job and quit messing with me. 
[00:24:30]  Thirty-five.  Oh, boy.  Very good.  How about a little demonstration?  No!  He's not going to take my head off.  Master Paul, how high can you kick?  He'll kill me.  Look at me.  You can tell how confident he is.  Let me see how high you can kick.  All right.  Well, first of all, kicking will get you in trouble in the street.  Okay?  You're not supposed to kick high at all.  I'm just messing with you.  All right.  That's number one.  No higher than the ball.  You got to kick the knee sideways.  If you kick below the hips, kick to the shin, kick to the knee, kick to the groin, that's  fine. 
[00:25:00]  After that, if you kick above that, you're in trouble.  But Daniel kicked in the face when Miyagi told him, you know, you taught him the crane  move.  He kicked in the face.  Yes.  No.  I know.  Because he got tired.  Yeah?  He what?  I forgot what I was going to say.  I was just going to say something that he was tired of Pat Morita raping in it.  I'm like, can I please just switch gears once?  See, nobody knows you.  I just want to see a high kick from Master Bob.  Nobody knows this.  Norton, years ago, used to have a shin, and somebody front-kicked him right here. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, is that it?  One out of seven isn't bad.  One bad one out of about seven.  Here's why I didn't get left, because it was mean and hurtful.  Yeah.  Mean and hurtful?  And I'm very insecure about my shin.  You're not insecure about your chin.  It hurts.  It hurts what?  The guy's balls?  Oh.  Well, it hurts.  All right.  One for eight.  It hurts everybody that looks at you.  All right?  You walking little troll.  Did he just say, did he say last night at the party the only famous people there were  him, Voss, and Leary? 
[00:26:00]  If you ever put yourself in the same category as Voss and Leary again when it comes to fame.  Oh, my God.  And if you ever address something I said being ironic and sarcastic as real again, I'll throw  my coffee on you.  I was kind of kidding, because I'm a nobody, so I was saying the only celebrities besides  me and you, like implying that we're asses, which we are, and then Leary, who has a hit  show.  Last night at the party.  I'll tell you real quick.  Before he takes my head.  I liked it.  I liked it.  I got a laugh out there.  Here's the only thing fat-free in front of him. 
[00:26:30]  Here's the thing.  That's a great visual for radio.  Thanks.  That doesn't matter.  There's always these guys laugh.  You're not on TV anymore, Stuart.  Don't ever move milk in front of me and then go, quiet, folks.  Don't you have some ironing to do?  Last night at the party, real quick, Sam Champion, if you don't know who he is, he's  a weatherman.  He's the gay weatherman.  In New York.  Jesus.  Was doing a thing about stand-up for this festival.  I didn't see him.  So he's on the mic and he says, you know, this whole stand-up thing is kind of cool. 
[00:27:00]  I think maybe I should do it.  What do I got to do?  And he calls me over and he says, you know, what should I do?  I go, well, look, you have stage presence.  You have the looks.  Of course, the only thing you lack is humor.  I said that to him, right?  And then I'm looking and I'm going, he's not a bad-looking guy.  I'm thinking to myself, you know, if I'm going to leave with somebody, you know what  I'm saying, a guy, Sam is my man.  That story went nowhere.  Well, because...  Well, we were distracted by the breathing. 
[00:27:30]  I'm thinking you might need oxygen.  I'm just trying to get out of it.  What's wrong with breathing?  Wait, what would you have said to Sam if he had milk in front of me?  I say, did you get that from Norton's breast?  Hey, that's good.  All right, two for ten.  Not two for ten.  One bad one and a bad story.  You've had two bad ones and...  And about six good ones.  Eight good ones.  All right, not bad.  Can you kick high, Master Paul?  He's making me uncomfortable.  Well...  Go and kick.  Let me see.  If you don't mind, what I'd like to do is just show you exactly how I'm going to protect  you guys.  Is that all right?  Oh, yeah.  Get over there, Rich. 
[00:28:00]  You can look at him and tell him he's a killer.  Dude, he's the real deal.  He's going to know he's a killer because he's polite to everyone when they come in.  Thank you for coming.  We're glad you're here.  That's the type of guy that tears your throat out.  Yeah, Vos, get over there.  A little demonstration.  Well, I'd rather not do it with Vos because I don't want him to get hurt.  Yeah.  I love him now.  Good.  And I think you're funny, by the way.  Thank you.  You're pretty hilarious.  Thank you.  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to have my...  He is a lunatic.  My student, Marcelino, he's going to assist me.  Now, Vos is very funny.  He's just a mess.  No, you're not leaving yet. 
[00:28:30]  Of course we have.  No.  Oh, you have problems?  Okay.  That's all right.  So we'll do this real quick, and if you can do me a favor, commentate.  Just tell us what's going on.  Of course, because it's radio.  That's our job.  We'll commentate.  All right, so Master Paul is going to show everybody in the studio how he's going to protect  us, Anthony.  Yeah.  Just squaring off.  Ben, get the mic near those guys.  Master Paul, why don't you explain what you're going to do before you do it?  That might help us.  Well, look, over there.  It's on TV.  It's the same thing.  Oh, wow.  Look on TV.  Watch this guy get shot.  They never show him getting shot anymore. 
[00:29:00]  No?  No.  No.  They cut it off right before he takes a bullet to the face, by the way.  The cops shot that hostage taker, the Mexican consulate.  Oh, that's what that was?  Yeah, there they go.  They shot him in the face.  Oh, in the face?  Nice.  Is he dead?  Critical.  How'd they get the bullet around her fat ass?  Surely it was a big, awful pineapple whore.  And he was holding a Stardust pistol, a fake cap gun.  Oh, he had a pistol?  He had a cap gun.  Oh, man.  It wasn't even a real gun.  See, look at that.  In one day, two people took it in the face. 
[00:29:30]  Come on, that wasn't bad.  That was bad.  That was...  I think you're hilarious.  Oh, God.  What?  We love you.  You got to do backflips in here?  I got some good lines.  All right.  Here goes Master Poe.  All right.  So, basically, what's going to happen is Mussolini will attack me, and...  Oh, my God.  I'm not...  I don't want to see this.  Wow.  I'm not going to give you the numbers as far as what I'm going to do.  Uh-huh.  Let's just say he's going to lose.  Okay.  Okay.  Are we aware of hard surfaces that can crack heads open over here? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, man.  I used to love being the toughest guy in the studio.  We don't even rate anymore.  These guys are like killers.  When were you the toughest guy in the studio?  I was just going to say you.  What about Anthony?  I fought four people.  No, I'm not putting me as tough guy in the studio, but I think Rick could have kicked  your ass.  We...  Rick could have kicked your ass.  We fought.  He would have held you down and used your nose to dock with his mule.  We fought.  We had a good fight.  You and Rick fought?  Yeah.  We did Fight Club.  I don't remember that one. 
[00:30:30]  Honestly, I think he got the best of me in the end, but I held my own, and then I beat  up Frenchie really bad.  Frenchie.  Yeah, Frenchie.  That's the judge's toughest guy in the studio?  And then I...  A souffle kicked his ass in the kitchen one night.  And then I gave Paul Bond a nice black eye.  He surrendered to Jeremy Coleman one day.  Oof.  Norris was the toughest guy.  Yeah, Norris is definitely the animal that came into the studio.  All right.  Bulldog.  Well, you know what I was saying.  We used to feel like we were men. 
[00:31:00]  We're not anymore.  I mean, look at these guys.  We're cared for.  Now we're cared for.  We're cared for.  We used to be able to think we could take care of ourselves, and that's the point I'm  making.  We can't.  How long have you been training?  You've been training for a long time, too, right?  Two years.  I'll give him some ear.  Oh, my God.  These guys are really getting into this.  Is that your defense?  Like a skunk?  Kvoss just rubs behind his ear and shoves it under someone's nose.  Oh, are we going to do that today?  I got some, probably.  I think I say some up.  Oh, nice.  Don't waste it.  Who's going to take it today?  Huh?  One of the interns.  Who hasn't?  All right. 
[00:31:30]  I think I got some.  Yeah.  You think you got some good stuff?  Yeah, I think I got some saved up.  We'll do that after the break.  All right.  Go ahead, Master Poe.  By the way, Marcelino is one of my top students.  Although he hasn't said anything to you guys, he is.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I'm glad I didn't see him.  Oh, he's a real student?  Look at him getting ready.  I know.  Oh, my God.  These guys aren't messing around.  I thought this was getting ready for the pain.  I didn't know he was a real student.  Oh, man.  Oh, jeez.  All right.  They're shaking.  He's taking flashlights and cell phones off of a student.  Anything that can impale him. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, my God.  I don't want to see this.  Are we filming this for opianthony.com?  All right.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Master Poe, he's.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  It's over in a second.  All right.  You know what?  Holy shit.  Holy.  You know what?  Yeah.  And he's got him down.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Bravo.  That was nice.  That's.  Holy.  Yes.  Oh, my. 
[00:32:30]  All right.  That guy would just be like, if that was full contact, he would just be dead.  We can't even describe it.  That was just insane.  It's a slow punch.  It's not a slow.  It's a punch to the face that Poe kind of steps out of the way at, winks at us, and then  just begins chopping the guy's neck.  It's horrifying.  And then he just hacks at every part of his body in a split second.  When he smacked his ass.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, he's breaking his arm.  All right.  Oh, don't break his arm.  Don't break his arm. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  I can't look at that.  Ow.  This is just a demonstration.  I can't even look at that.  That's.  Oh.  Oh, no, no, no.  Don't hurt him.  Master Poe, don't hurt his arm like that.  Oh, my God.  Master Poe, don't hurt him.  Someone wake up, Master Poe.  Someone wake him up.  He's reading bosses.  Get Master Poe back to reality.  To get him more angry.  Master Poe, how do we wake him up?  Master Poe.  Wake up.  Master Poe.  I understand, Master Poe.  Get out of the zone.  Oh, God.  All right.  Don't snap his neck.  He's tapping out.  All right.  He tapped out.  Oh, my God. 
[00:33:30]  Okay.  All right.  No.  I think we're done.  Oh, no.  That's good.  That's good.  That's good.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  You've got to see the video.  Holy.  Master Poe goes to another place.  He just zones out.  Yeah, it was great.  Thank you, Master Poe.  Bravo.  Now, Ben, what you were saying.  There goes Master Poe.  Oh, my God.  Very good.  Very good.  Bravo.  Oh, my God.  He's for real, man.  Imagine trying to get, like, a punch in edgewise.  It just wouldn't happen.  Because your arm, you look at the punch as an aggressive thing. 
[00:34:00]  He's like, oh, great.  This extended limb can be snapped.  Of course.  And then, like, when the guy goes and attacks him, all he does is totally disables your arms.  He's, like, hacking at your arms.  And then, if you think you're getting out of the way of that, an elbow will hit you in the face.  And then he'll grab the arm and twist it right off.  And then he grabbed his head and started twisting it to where he...  It was a demonstration, and Mars was definitely, like, in pain.  Well, he knew he was getting ready for pain, too, because you could see he was just like, ugh. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, I know this move.  Oh, I've done this before, and I know what it's like.  Oh.  What up?  I really have to apologize for being mean to him.  No kidding.  Oh, man.  That guy's a killer.  We've been saying it.  Oh, my God.  He's the real deal.  That's so successful.  He comes in the other...  One of the interns rats him out the other day and comes in here and goes,  Guys, I saw Master Po putting a bloody gi, which is, what, the karate top or whatever,  into a dumpster at five in the morning.  So we had to bring him in to ask him what that was all about.  And then he told us a story about his dog being in a dog fight and taking the dog to the hospital. 
[00:35:00]  And he told it so seriously, he goes,  Do you really want to know what happened?  I go, uh, I guess.  So he tells this story about his dog.  Do you want to know the real truth or something?  Yeah.  So then Norton...  Aw, did Norton spray one of his defenses?  Yes, he did.  Norton and I go to breakfast after the show, and we talked about it for like 10, 15 minutes.  We're like, are you buying this story or what?  I mean, there's part of our brains thinking, is it real or not?  There's some dead student somewhere.  Someone who's, you know, check bounced. 
[00:35:30]  Heffron's a karate.  He's like Israeli karate.  He's pretty tough, too.  Yeah, Heffron took it for a long time.  Yeah, I know.  I guess with that act, he'd have to have karate.  Heffron's hilarious.  I know.  He's funny.  We're going to get him in here next.  All right?  Oh, man, that was some scary looking.  Wasn't that scary?  I didn't want to kick like doing...  Yeah, I did it 20 years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, throw a kick at it.  Your leg would be out of the socket.  Because even if you got it through...  Your move was so cute compared to what he was doing.  Wasn't it adorable?  You had such an adorable little karate kick.  Oh, I want to put ribbons in my hair. 
[00:36:00]  You go to the strip mall, and you see the little kids in there doing their first karate  kicks.  It's like watching the cute little kids through the window of a tiger showman.  And there's Vals.  I think that kick could have broken a piece of balsa wood.  It was nice.  Jesus.  I mean, honestly, it was sort of impressive until I saw that guy.  And then it puts it in perspective there.  It was cute.  He's into that hand-to-hand combat shit where he wants to grab you.  Normally, you want to just kick and run.  Pungy stick fight.  Imagine what he can do with a sharpened stick.  Oh, yeah.  He's a weapons master, too. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, sticks, knives.  He's crazy.  He'll do a knife fight, and you'll just be cut up on the floor.  That's the kind of guy you want to hang out with, though.  Of course it is.  Yeah, so you can rest assured we're getting him to the Hammerstein in case there's any  problems.  Don't you want to go to a bar with him and just go to the bar and go,  Hey, asshole, move.  Can you and that fat whore wife of yours get out of my way?  And meanwhile, it's the biggest guy at the bar.  You just walk up to him and go, Hey, dick, move.  Oh, let my friend Master Poe take care of you if you have any problems with me telling 
[00:37:00]  your pig wife to get out of the way.  No one's going to mess with him just because of that look he gives.  You know what?  With guys like that, I never talk shit to other people.  Like when I'm at Club Soda Kenny.  You don't know.  No, no.  Just because if I'm with Club Soda Kenny, I know he would defend me.  With his life.  And I also know he's a psychopath, and he would kill somebody.  It's like you don't want to get the guy you're with on a murder route.  Right.  That's why I always go, Nah, it's cool.  I would walk away.  You don't know who has a gun, too, though.  Yeah, Kenny.  Oh.  You think he's a psychopath?  He's 6'5 and skips down the sidewalk. 
[00:37:30]  He's 6'5, he skips, and he's also a 27-year martial artist.  I would defend your honor if we were in a bar.  Vos, you'd defend it with your mouth, though.  Don't talk about him.  Don't hurt him.  I'll do whatever it takes.  Oh, no.  You guys want to hear the Silence of the Lambs song?  Yes.  I do got a break.  I had this song in my head all night long.  Maybe that's why I didn't sleep.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Yeah.  I'll love that one.  Put the effing lotion in the basket.  Buffalo Bill and Catherine.  We're going to get these guys on the show in the very near future.  Steve found them. 
[00:38:00]  He did.  Yeah, it's these two guys from California.  They did the Silence of the Lambs, the musical.  It's great.  And they're sending us a better copy, matter of fact.  Nice.  Because we got this off the internet.  And they send great files over the internet, don't they now?  Or a fucking poodle in the trash.  Dude, I could not stop listening to the replay I heard.  Yeah.  I caught it.  It was great.  Well, let's listen to it again.  Oh, boss is doing some karate moves.  Want Master Poe back in here?  I'll do them all myself.  What was that, though?  He's doing karate moves with a pack of Marlboro in one hand and the lighter in the other. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, brother.  All right, let's check this song again.  Master Nicotine.  Boss is Master Poe.  This is Rich Boss.  You might recognize me if you were on the train today.

[00:42:00]  Vail is ready with well over a half a foot of new snow.  They continue to cruise over 5,000 acres open at Vail.  Aspen, Colorado, ready with a foot of fresh snow for about 70 runs in some powder conditions.  127 trails now open at the canyons with all five bowls.  Sun Valley, Idaho with over 60 trails.  Mount Batchelor with a little fresh snow in about 50 runs.  Squaw Valley, USA, a big winner.  A foot and a half of new snow.

Tubing and 17 trails open with some nighttime terrain.  I'm John Davis with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you, what what? 
[00:43:00]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best that I can.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  Now, no way.  Boss doing those Sully height kicks that he was doing before.  Reaching the top of Sully's little head.  Speaking of Godsmack, they're going to be in the studio maybe within the next few weeks  doing a little acoustic set for us and their DVD's out.  It's great.  We have Martini Steve back in the studio. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  And he was observing Master Poe during the commercial break.  What was going on?  That little...  Sorry.  Martini Steve.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  He's so annoyed.  Really.  I just wish it would go away.  A lot of the listeners are with you on that show, but tough shit.  All right.  That little display from Master Poe and Mars, that was no bullshit. 
[00:44:00]  He's out in his cubicle, or he was during the break, decompressing.  He's in a zone.  Yeah.  And if Mars hadn't tapped his leg like he did, he would have kept going.  He would have kept going until Mars' arms snapped.  That's what he does.  He keeps going.  You've got to tap out.  And then when he's done, he had to go to his cubicle and, like, wind down, or he'd just  stay in this mood.  Destructive mood.  Yeah.  You can see it in his eyes.  Yeah.  He goes to another place when he's doing that stuff.  Yeah.  Eric asked him about some paperwork or something, and Master Poe was like, just give me a minute. 
[00:44:30]  Give me a couple of minutes.  Yeah.  And he shut his eyes and just kind of breathe and calm down.  Where the hell did XM Satellite Radio get this guy from?  He's fantastic.  Yeah.  He's like a trained assassin.  He has to come to events and everything.  There has to be one Lister he can strangle.  Wouldn't that be great to see?  Just see that in full contact?  A Lister.  Screw that.  How about a staff member?  Imagine that in full contact?  Yeah.  Watching someone just get put down in a second?  But even that play stuff.  He really hurt Mars' hand.  Play.  That was no play. 
[00:45:00]  Well, I mean, you know, the half-ass punch Mars threw, he blocked it with his elbow, and  Mars smashed his arm right into it.  I've heard that these guys practice during the whole show.  Yeah, if you watch during the show, they go off into Poe's office, and Master Poe's office,  and they'll just start sparring with each other, and they'll really, really do semi-full  contact stuff until they're both winded and hurt.  There's all kinds of stuff going on here.  But Poe is his instructor.  Yeah.  You know what?  When we clear out this whole studio, and we have all that open space outside, we ought  to put a little section over there where we can have a mat. 
[00:45:30]  I don't want to see it.  And a heavy bag or something.  No way.  We get Taylor Law in here, or someone really hot like that, and you say, if you can put  Poe down, this girl will blow you.  Hey, you get takers.  That's right.  And then watch me take a swing at it.  Catch my beating like a man, and receive my Hummer in the hospital.  Let's get John Heffron in here, man.  Yeah, bring him.  You know somebody, too, will try to test him after they hear that?  Oh, of course.  You know what Tyson, with a person, there's so much on a test.  Do you think he gets a boxer, like a pro, like, who would win, do you think? 
[00:46:00]  Like, you know, the master, or like, say, a golden glove.  No.  Yeah, boxers are really only for their own environment.  Yeah.  Take them out of that.  Gracie and those guys murder boxers.  Yeah.  They just grab you by the legs or by the arm and twist your arm.  Grapple you up and then twist your arm out of its socket.  Like a turkey leg.  Gracie won't punch at first until he gets you down.  That's the thrill of it for him.  He doesn't want to punch.  He won't throw a punch at your face until you're down.  He'll tie you up so you can't move.  They get on you like a web, and you're just stuck there, and then they can take an elbow 
[00:46:30]  and just start pounding your face in with an elbow.  It's great to watch.  I love those.  Ultimate fighting.  I hear you're pretty good, too.  That's what I hear.  No, I suck.  But I love it, though.  I'm like a fan.  Are you a fan of it?  You know what I mean?  Like, I know all those guys in Gracie and Boss Root and Tito Ortiz, all the huge UFC guys  and stuff like that.  There was a point where the Gracies used to be able to beat everyone's ass because nobody  knew how to ground fight, right?  Those guys would take a punch, and then they'd end up screwing you on the ground. 
[00:47:00]  But now it's kind of evolved to the point where now people kind of know how to ground  fight, and, you know, jiu-jitsu doesn't necessarily always win.  So there's other people that are kicking their ass now?  Yeah, and jiu-jitsu's great if you're in that type of environment.  You're at a bar, and let's say I'm a black belt in jiu-jitsu, and I'm going to, you know,  take your elbow and somehow put it through your rectum and out your mouth, is good if  you didn't go to the bar with a buddy of yours.  So why I'm doing that to you, your buddy is teeing off on my face and, you know, stomping 
[00:47:30]  me into the ground.  That's true.  The bar fight things, usually there is a buddy involved.  Yeah, so I mean, there's, you know.  But can't those jiu-jitsu guys, they can also punch real quick, too.  I mean, like, they can wrap you up, but they can also snap your arm real quick and then  go about their business to your friend.  Your buddy.  Yeah.  What's the difference?  Isn't that, like, Hopkido, or isn't that what he just did?  Hopkido?  Yeah, Hopkido, right?  There's Hopkido, there's Akido, then there's Hopkido, which is Korean, which is using the  persons that, why am I talking like Daniel Sundar? 
[00:48:00]  Do you know Gracie's personally?  You know those people like?  Not personally, no.  You think the ultimate fighting guys are telling jokes right now somewhere?  I just don't like the fact that Voss is asking fourth grade questions.  Are they personal friends of yours?  Yes, I'm just setting them up so you can get a picture with them, okay, stupid?  Okay, I'm just looking out for you, so you can run behind them with your camera.  Who do you think would win?  God or karate expert?  No, honestly, in a race, if it was between Kit and Herbie the Love Bug, which one would 
[00:48:30]  win?  How long did you take it for?  I've done what I do for maybe two and a half, three years, but the problem with what they  don't incorporate in the training is guys who stay out to four and booze.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Eventually, I don't care how good of a martial artist you are, if you smoke and drink, you're  done in about 90 seconds just because your body's going to go, no, dude, you're a tool,  you don't take care of yourself.  I'm going to make sure nothing works.  Yeah.  And also, the toughest guy always wins. 
[00:49:00]  I will completely tell you, I'm a huge wuss.  As much as I spar and stuff like that, I don't have that thing inside of me that I'm not a  mean.  The fight thing.  Yeah, I don't have that mean guy thing, right?  Where guys who don't even know how to fight, that just, maybe their dads weren't around enough  for them.  Well, we saw that when you cried on TV.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  So there you go.  I cried on TV.  I didn't even...  Did he really cry?  What show was that?  It wasn't a...  Yeah, that's what it was.  I was trying to get the soccer mom's vote on that. 
[00:49:30]  Last comic show.  What show was that?  Oh, the second season.  Oh, the second season.  Yeah, the second season.  Everyone watched the first season.  On the second season, you had to cry to win or advance.  Oh, is that it?  It's the only house that had a lifeguard in it.  They cried so much.  The second season was very popular, too.  Shut up.  I'm talking to you.  I like the second season of Last Comic Stadium.  It was very popular.  It was nice.  I cried, but now I'm independently wealthy, so I will take the tears and the ridicule.  And then next week, I'm buying a Lexus cash.  Now you can cry, stupid.  1951 Mercedes. 
[00:50:00]  Start crying.  I should cry.  I'm a Saturn.  Faggot sedan.  Here's your Saturn, sir.  Thank you.  That's fine.  All right.  Boss is Reggie.  He had to trade it over from...  It said Adolf Hitler on it.  I'm going to get another one now.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A new one?  Yeah, well, I'll probably get like a 2001 or something.  You like the classics.  I can't buy a new Mercedes because I'm a Jew, so I'm not going to put money back into their  economy.  So you think buying it used... 
[00:50:30]  Buying it used, it's already paid for, so I'm like putting money back into their economy.  Really?  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not realizing that once somebody sells it to you, they're going to go out and spend  90 grand on a new one.  On a brand new one.  So you're putting not only the 40 you'd probably spend on a new one, but the 90 that they're going  to spend.  So you're putting a lot more back in the German economy.  He'd be one of the guys that pulled the dead bodies out of the gas chamber.  And you know, I wasn't putting them in.  I'm just clearing them out.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Making room for the new ones.  Or, no, couldn't you spend 30 on like an F-10 pickup and give it to people in Tennessee? 
[00:51:00]  What's an F-10?  No, I'm a Mercedes driver.  I'm a headliner.  I can't be driving a pickup.  I'm going to look good.  I'm a big act.  Are you kidding me?  You really getting a Lexus?  Mm-mm.  Oh.  I really want a nice new car.  I told you it again.  I told him.  I said, look, you're doing well.  He's, you know, he was selling out theaters, this creep, was selling out theaters.  We remember, until we fucked it up for him.  Yep.  No, he still did all right after you guys.  It's not like you guys were the only thing in the world. 
[00:51:30]  You know, we have other things going on.  Yeah, no, you're right.  They weren't the only thing in the world.  But I was in Orlando doing 50 people on a Thursday night.  No, you're right.  Who needs these two?  No.  25 of them comps.  Exactly, yeah.  Radio station comps.  His real name should be Stepping Stone.  He didn't even talk to Colin last night at Colin's farewell party.  He knew Colin was gone.  Because I don't know what a farewell party...  Oh, I said it right.  You said it right.  I meant to muffle up when I said it right.  Because you said a farewell party. 
[00:52:00]  And I'm like, I don't even know what a farewell party is.  Oh, yes, I do.  It's a farewell party.  A farewell party.  A farewell party.  A farewell party.  So, were you pissed because you won season two, and there's all that cash out there,  and then they rush right into season three.  Were you kind of mad that, like...  No time to bask.  Yeah, it sucked.  Right, right, right.  It sucked because I was offered, like, not a lot of television, but more television than  I've ever done before.  But they said I couldn't do it because it would give me an advantage on season three.  So, that kind of got crapped on. 
[00:52:30]  And then they made me do season three.  And even a prom queen gets to be the queen for a year.  Yeah, you got nothing.  So, yeah, I really didn't want to do season...  Wow, that does suck.  I didn't want to do season three.  So, yeah, I was kind of bummed.  They just wrecked that franchise by throwing that third season out there.  Yeah, plus...  Not too bad.  Yeah, with me, it was a tough call because you're like...  I'm like, well, I don't want to do it because I'd kind of rather do, you know, some other  shows to kind of...  But then they said, well, you're not allowed to.  So, then it's a tough call.  You go, well, I'm going to turn down national television.  I mean, I'm not at that level yet, but on the same token, I probably should 
[00:53:00]  have, or wish I could have.  Wow.  You could have turned...  You know what?  I mean, I probably could have.  No, I could have said, yeah, but, you know, it's tough to go, yeah, dang it, I'm going  to not do primetime NBC.  I'll show you.  Yeah.  But in your contract in the second season, couldn't you have said, if I win, I had the  stipulation not to do season three?  Did I say stipulation?  No, you said contract.  I said contract.  It's a great...  It's a thing you sign and then eat if you have a cold. 
[00:53:30]  Contract.  What did I say?  Contract.  Tiny little time-release paperwork.  Whatever.  You can't...  Listen, it's just a word.  Really, people put too much emphasis on words.  That's it.  Voss just diffused the whole thing.  It's just a word.  It's just a word.  Voss makes me laugh.  You know what?  I'll tell you what sucks.  At least Heffron, people know, you know, I mean, everybody knows who he is. 
[00:54:00]  He won.  And season two was a big hit.  On season three, they didn't even show the winner.  They canceled the last episode.  No, they canceled the show before the last episode.  Yeah, who won?  I forgot.  People come up to me and say, well, they'll come up to me at shows and go, who won?  And I go, I did.  Right?  You might as well.  Sure are.  They don't know.  Alonzo, you know, I mean, listen, to cancel the last episode, he would have made more money  in clubs with people knowing he won.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He got hosed, too.  You know, people not knowing.  But they still know you, though, man. 
[00:54:30]  You're still doing good.  They all know you from the season two.  From season two.  Yeah.  And, you know, even people who came on and saw me would go, you're on season three?  Yeah.  You don't watch?  No.  No.  You know, it's different.  Yeah, I'm not complaining.  It was too much.  It was like, yeah, you get season one, season two, and then they threw in that lame season  three.  It was too much.  That was the network, I think, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's kind of like probably finishing yourself off and continue to watch the porn.  It's just dumb.  Yeah.  There's really no reason for it.  You need to just stop and set it away for when you're in the mood again.  Right.  That's how I do it.  That might be 20 minutes later, but, you know, there's got to be some kind of. 
[00:55:00]  But if you keep watching it, it's a waste.  Yeah.  And nobody enjoys it.  Completely.  Nobody.  There's season one, 50 grand every week.  What was that?  Just spanking.  Season two won 50 grand every week, spanking season one.  And just, you know, there was one week.  Wow.  What?  I don't know.  I swear to God.  I don't know.  I'm not even making.  What did you just say?  You know, it's just these earphones.  I can't hear myself.  You should have saw the look.  I'm trying to follow you.  You said something about 50 grand a week.  50 grand.  Yeah, season two won 50 grand a week against season one. 
[00:55:30]  On season three, it was head-to-head competition, head-to-head as in competing, and they won  50 grand every week.  And this is how popular season two was.  Yeah.  That one week, Ralphie, Dave, Dat, me, like the four most known from season one went  up against, you know, and they still beat us for 50 grand.  I'm just saying.  I think Dat fan was.  You guys were the ones who brought up the dumb show.  I'm not.  I'm listening.  I just didn't know what you were saying.  You know.  Season two was bigger.  I think Dat fan brought all of yous down is what it was.  Brought the average of the whole first season down. 
[00:56:00]  How you were second place to that.  I wasn't second.  I was third.  Third.  Ralphie was second.  Sorry.  Yeah, but you know what?  He's only a kid.  Sorry, I thought you were second.  No, Ralphie wasn't.  Ralphie.  Oh, you did come in third.  I came in third.  Who cares?  I thought you should have won.  Of those three, Ralphie's funny, but you should have won.  Dad, I don't care about it, but you should have won.  Every season, I should have won.  I'm the biggest veteran on those shows.  What are you kidding me?  I mean, the kid's all right over here.  Alonzo's okay.  This kid's all right.  I mean, he's not a bad guy.  You know.  You're kidding.  He's a likeable.  He's funny.  I like his energy and stuff.  But shit, I'm a fucking legend, okay? 
[00:56:30]  I've done a lot of shit in this fucking business.  Deb Jam, Rosie.  I've done it all.  You know, these guys, they do what?  Deb Jam, Rosie?  I did from Deb Jam to Rosie.  I hosted Woodstock.  You know, this isn't some fucking just because I was in a contest.  You know, it's Rick Voss.  I went to the contest.  It was Rick Voss.  I've been to several comedy clubs where actually the Caesar salad is called the Rich Voss Caesar salad.  I'm telling you.  Rick Voss.  You're right.  They spell it wrong.  Yeah.  Yeah, and that's how you determine if you made it as a comic is if you get some of the munchies, you know, named after you. 
[00:57:00]  I'm looking for the heifer and chicken tenders.  You know what I mean?  That would be a proud moment.  That the MC has to plug.  Yeah.  God, I wish I could think of something funny to connect with a comic to food.  Yeah.  No one's known after the scallop because he's boneless.  You didn't have to explain why.  No one is looking at me going, why would he say scallop?  No one's got one for them.  There's no bone in that.  That's odd.  And known after the scallop. 
[00:57:30]  Am I known after the scallop?  That's right.  I'm post-scallop.  John, you want some Jaeger Meister?  I was looking at that.  That's the real deal, yeah.  I was told that, but is it plugged in?  Oh, it's cold.  I don't think I could do Jaeger.  You want to do a shot?  It ices it up to five degrees.  Five degrees.  Where's your show?  What time is your show?  Tonight?  Yeah.  It'll be at like 11 at night or 10 o'clock.  There's at Caroline's.  There's like two shows tonight because there's some other thing going on because of the comedy festival.  Oh, festival, okay.  Then there's a sexual. 
[00:58:00]  Last time I did Jaeger, I think it was, Jaeger's that one booze, you know, if you do too much  where you know at the end of that night you go, I probably took a year off my, or a day  off my life.  Jaeger's one of them.  I passed out in a stall of a bathroom with Jaeger once.  Jaeger Meister's the black death.  And if I smell it out.  Like whiskey or booze?  It's like a liquor, it's almost licorice flavor.  I love the people at Jaeger Meister, but it's not one of my favorites.  What is it, Lance?  I love the Jaeger.  Like Zambuca?  Huh?  It's like Zambuca?  No, not that much.  No, it's, um, it's, licorice is the best way to, yeah. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  And usually the people doing Jaeger have the words Amber Crumby and Fitch written on some  part of their body with shell necklaces.  Right.  Still very good, I mean, but it's, it's like a college drink, but not, but then some people  still do it.  I don't want to bust the people who gave me the Jaeger.  A lot of people still do it.  I remember, uh, the worst drink was tequila though.  I'm a huge tequila fan.  Man.  I'm, I'm little, but I, I can drink a lot of tequila.  I woke up on the floor of the bathroom at home one day.  It was, you know, one morning you just wake up and go, why the hell am I on the bathroom 
[00:59:00]  floor?  And then you all start slowly coming back to you.  Yeah.  I remember kind of coming in.  I remember that.  Oh, tequila.  A lot of shots.  And then you're just horrified going out and looking where you're and how your car was  parked.  Mine was, I've been doing this thing a lot lately.  Coke.  Oh yeah.  You guys try that?  Yeah.  I'm relatively new to it, but do you snort it or smoke it?  I snort it.  That's pussy.  Listen to me.  To be a good Coke addict, you got to like sell your mom's stereo and suck a car. 
[00:59:30]  Then you know that you're doing Coke.  You're such a good addict.  You forgot the stereo, but you suck the cock in recovery.  In recovery?  I'm sober three years, but what the hell?  You used to smoke it, Rich?  Oh, yeah.  Free base.  What are you kidding me?  Where did you get?  I always get mad watching people that snort it because it's like living a book backwards.  It is.  It's like, you know, I can tell you something.  One time I go, I mean, this is a light one.  My friend, I go, do you really think you're going home with those new sneakers? 
[01:00:00]  You know, and that coat?  You know, get rid of it.  We're selling it.  You know.  You would sell your clothing.  Oh, Voss was the real deal.  Oh, is this a real story?  Oh, yeah.  Voss used to be.  There's a lot more Coke stories than fucking, what do you call it?  One time someone, okay, I owe these drug dealers money, so they torched my mother's car.  Like, they just burnt her car, right?  That's real?  Yeah, they torched her car because I owed them money.  I said, you know, so I called them.  I said, look, now not only do we get insurance, I'm not giving you the goddamn money, right? 
[01:00:30]  So she goes out and gets a new car, right?  And I have it.  She lends me it in New York.  So I'm driving, and someone smashes into it, right?  And just wrecks the whole side, and I go to that person, look, just give me $100, and  I'll let you go.  And they gave me $100, and I just went and copped 10 vials, and I told my mom, I don't  know, somebody hit your car, parked on the street.  Oh, man, you let them go for $100.  Hey, listen, when you're going to cop, and you're going over to GW, and once you get  over, and you got another $100, plus what you take out of the other people's vials that 
[01:01:00]  you're running in for.  Of course you take it, a little for yourself.  You dip out of every single one.  Oh, man.  They must have seen you get out of the car with that awful long hair, and oh, this junky  motherfucker.  Here's $8, okay?  Oh, the pictures we saw with the jerry curl and the bad teeth and everything?  You know the fake, how they had those fake $50 advertisement bills?  Yeah, you'd see them laying on the ground, and go, what's this?  We used to wrap like 10 singles around it.  I'd pull up on the guy, and I'd go, give me six vials, and I'd count it like this away 
[01:01:30]  from him, and I'd hand it to him and just drive away, give him the fake $50.  One time, I tried to grab it out of his hand, and he punched me in the face twice.  This is a true story.  I snatched it out of his hand.  He punched me twice in the face, and I'm going, oh, did he?  So I drove away.  This is true, and I opened my hand.  I had like three vials.  I got them.  Oh, you got it.  So I'm all excited.  This is true.  I pull down the street, and I get like two miles down the road.  I throw it in the pipe, and I hit it, and it was soap.  The son of a bitch got you back. 
[01:02:00]  You know, you pull it back, and I'm like, look, you don't rip me off when I'm ripping  you off, but I hit the busted deal.  No honor.  No honor.  But why would he punch me in the head twice for stealing soap?  Because he could have sold that soap.  On principle.  Right?  It's on principle.  I'm new to the whole drug thing.  Like, I wasn't a big druggie, but then I've had a couple nights recently because of the  stress, and this is where I decided I'm never doing it again.  I was doing, and, you know, now I look at the tops of the toilet paper holder every 
[01:02:30]  time I go into a stall, because, you know, before I was naive, I'm like, what takes dudes  so long?  You know, just rip and piss.  But I realized that that's where they're doing their lines and stuff, and I was so screwed  up.  I looked on the floor, because I was totally out, and I looked on the floor, and I saw  a bunch of white stuff.  I'm like, oh, somebody brushed it off, and it fell on the floor, but there's a crap load  there, and I went down there and took my finger and went like that.  Oh, man.  And now whatever, and it was like cleaning, you can tell it was Clorox, you know, like  Ajax or something like that, and I went, okay, I probably have a problem, and then I mess 
[01:03:00]  up.  So I was a drug addict for maybe two and a half weeks.  If you're snorting coke from the floor, that isn't even coke.  That's bad?  That's a bad sign?  I was like, you might be a drug addict.  You might be a drug addict if you've seen this act more than once and laughed, you might  be a drug addict.  I see a bumper sticker coming.  We used to, me and my brother used to sell out of the house, and the people that would  come to the door with everything. 
[01:03:30]  You know, I have stereos.  One guy brought a huge, you know, from the water coolers, the big bottles of water that  you put in a water cooler full of pennies on a hand truck.  And he's banging on the door, it's like two in the morning, guys, guys, like, no, you  gotta, we need cash, we need cash.  Can't be taking that.  Stereos, cars, anything.  I just maybe thought of an internet company you could start maybe, called E, what's, not 
[01:04:00]  zoning, E, what, I see the joke going on funny.  Kind of like eBay, but where people can give up stuff just to get drugs.  Oh, like a trading?  You don't bid for it, yeah.  Like a barter system?  Yeah, where people can just sign up.  Where you can sign that big jug full of pennies for cocaine?  Yeah, and then you send it to them.  Oh.  It might work.  It would have been funny if I could have remembered.  I was thinking, like, E-Jonesing.  We were with you, though, man.  Yeah, we went with it for a while there.  It was there for a little bit.  I was hanging.  I'm like, yeah.  We're like, sounds like. 
[01:04:30]  Need a little more help here.  I fell short.  I didn't.  Boss, when did you decide to get help?  Was there one story where you said, I got it?  Yeah, I could tell you a story.  If you've got one minute, I'll run through this quick.  We have an hour and a half.  The burning mom's car wasn't the problem.  This is a true story.  God, your mom.  Did she hate you for that?  Well, you know, I'm a kid.  How could she?  I was her favorite.  Because my brother and sister were really fucked up.  Here's the thing.  How could they be more fucked up than that?  No, I'm just kidding.  I was real.  Here's the deal.  Well, I'll tell you a couple.  So, one time.  No, I'll tell you the bottom story. 
[01:05:00]  No, tell us a couple.  And then finish with the big one.  Well, at one time, I called my father.  This is not even a bad story, but just at like 3 in the morning.  No, maybe like 11 at night.  I call him.  I go, can I come over?  And I go, can I have $20?  I've got to get a gallon of paint.  11 o'clock at night.  I told him, I need a gallon.  A gallon of paint.  He obviously wasn't buying it, right?  I had a painting.  But here's the bottom story.  The real, it was like 7 o'clock.  I had no money.  Someone calls me. 
[01:05:30]  I go into New York for him.  I cop, whatever.  And I come home.  I end up with six vials of crack.  I smoke them all by 10.  Then I go back in, right, with my other friends.  This is true.  As we're going in, we're going down Route 1 and 9 in like a Z100 or whatever.  Whatever.  I'm not lying.  We just wipe the car out, spin, take down one of those metal light posts.  On 1 and 9, all the wheels are off the car.  The car's crushed, right?  None of us are hurt.  We run, report the car stolen, and take another car in. 
[01:06:00]  So that's my second trip.  And I do like maybe five more vials and come back out.  Now, wait.  Now, I'm going to pick up a friend of mine who's a comic.  I'm going to take some vitamins right now.  Crack it.  This is true.  Now, I'm going to go pick up my friend who's a comic at the airport, right?  I pick him up.  We go in the city.  He cops heroin.  And I copped like five more vials, right?  Because he had money.  I didn't have any money at all the whole night.  This is my third trip in now from Jersey.  I couldn't even get a cab today.  How are you getting the vials with no money?  The first one, I went and copped for somebody. 
[01:06:30]  So I made money, you know, to do it.  The second one, my friends were going in, and they were treating.  It was like, you know, four or five vials to hang out with me.  Treating.  You know, just to hang out.  And I took them to the spot, too.  I was taking them to.  I treat people for lunch.  What the fuck?  This is true story.  The third trip we go in, we cop like, you know, maybe six more vials, seven.  I'm driving home.  I drop him off.  And I'm driving down 22 after I smoked all night.  The sun's coming up.  And I get this pain in my stomach, right? 
[01:07:00]  So I pull over.  I walk into the hotel on 22.  And I fall on the floor.  They call me an ambulance, right?  They take me to the hospital because I had like a kidney stone.  So I didn't thought I was dying.  And they shoot me with like, they gave me like morphine and Demerol or something, right?  I wake up, right?  I leave the hospital.  And I go back to New York.  Oh, no.  Right back to it.  Right back to it.  And then I said, you know what?  Maybe I should go to rehab.  What was wrong with your stomach?  A kidney stone.  A kidney stone.  So, you know, I mean, stories like that where you just keep going and don't stop. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  He's whacking off the doctor to get the drugs.  He's like, no, dude.  I would give this to you anyway.  It's just good.  What do I owe you?  No, dude.  It's part of it.  We give morphine.  Yeah, that's what we do here at the hospital.  You're not going to burn my mom's car, are you?  No, dude.  Really.  It's aspirin.  It's good.  I worked in Boston.  I met a girl.  There was a club at Worcester called Plums.  Worcester?  Worcester.  Worcester.  Yeah, Worcester, master, whatever. 
[01:08:00]  That's what your grammar is compared to everyone else's.  You make me sound like an English major.  I love when you come in.  What's the problem?  It's just a word.  Wow.  Worcester?  That's great.  What's it called?  Worcester.  Worcester.  Worcester.  Then I drove to Boston.  Oh, my God.  Worcester.  I love him.  How do you not love him?  Just say New England.  We'll know where you're talking about.  Met some girl, waitress. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  I said, I'm not going to get high tonight.  I'm going to save my money.  I meet her up there.  This is no lie.  I drive all.  She goes, do you do coke?  I go, yeah.  She was a hot waitress.  Pick her up.  I go, can you cop?  And she couldn't find anywhere in Boston.  I go, I know a spot.  I drive down to New York from Boston.  Oh, no.  I'm not lying.  I pull in.  We get all kinds of crack and coke.  We get one of those hotels in Jersey on like one and nine.  It's like fleece-stricken.  I'm banging her and doing coke and this and that. 
[01:09:00]  Then I'm driving her back.  We're trying to get heroin and stuff just to calm the nerves.  Just to snort it.  What a mess.  You've never told these stories on the air.  This is amazing.  Taco Bell was closed.  As we're driving, my nose just started, blood started gushing down my face.  How are you alive?  You got to do six hours of driving on a coke binge?  After the night before, we're trying to come down and she's crying because she's going  to be late for work and my face is bloody and I'm all over my clothes.  And then she goes, her and her sister wanted to get an ounce of coke and they were going 
[01:09:30]  to give me a couple grand and I was just going to rob her and rip her off, you know?  Of course.  And I didn't do it.  And then like five years later, I was performing in Florida and she was there with a big guy,  boyfriend at the time.  Would have kicked your ass.  They would have killed me.  You know, what I would have thought that I, you know, I used to go on the road all the  time and tell people, you know, give me a gram on credit and I'll pay you, you know,  Sunday night after the gig.  But, you know, I'm already out of town.  You're gone.  I'm done.  How many people fronted you? 
[01:10:00]  The last show is Saturday.  Yeah, if I'm not there on Sunday, the last show is Saturday, stupid.  If you withdraw, then you would know that.  Here's the thing.  Well, no, I do Sunday shows.  I don't have to bail out Saturday.  We have Thursday through Sunday.  You're right.  Sorry, stupid.  But the money I make, I only have to do Friday and Saturday.  No, my question was, did you leave after the show Sunday or would you bail out Saturday?  I wouldn't.  No, no, I would get Saturday night after the show.  Okay, so now instead of ripping off Coke dealers, you're ripping off customers.  Ten bucks.  Listen to it on the way home. 
[01:10:30]  That's amazing stuff, man.  It's amazing.  You were really a crackhead, man.  Well, I was a drug addict.  How did you, you bought from the real dregs, though?  Did you go into the brother neighborhoods?  They must have seen you coming.  I used to go up to 168th and after.  I had keys to the front doors of the buildings.  They gave me keys.  And one night we were going to, me and the connie, this connie used to get high.  Frank, you didn't know Frank.  Frank, you didn't know Frank.  Frank, you didn't know Frank Bastille.  Did you know who's a heroin addict?  How did they not just rob you?  Well, we went up one night and we were running out of money. 
[01:11:00]  So we hooked up with this Puerto Rican guy and he said, well, look, I got a shotgun.  Why don't we kick a door open and just rob him?  We said, yeah, that sounds good.  Hey, there you go.  But I'm telling you, he goes to get a shotgun and we're driving to go.  And I said, you know what?  We can't do this because they have lookouts now.  I go, this is crazy.  They'll kill us.  So we blew that idea out.  Wow.  Good.  I can tell you.  Pussy.  But wait, the story when you had the gallstone or you're passing the crack pipe.  Yeah.  Is that when you went, you know what?  I'm done.  It's over for me. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  That was the day.  And then the next day, you didn't do anything else?  Well, maybe another week, but that was, you know.  And then you went someplace, some farm somewhere.  I called this guy at Book's Room.  I said, look, I'm going to rehab tomorrow.  Give me a gig tonight.  And he gave me a gig.  It was 60 bucks.  I did the gig.  Went and bought six vials.  I smoked them until the morning, right, until the sun came up.  My mother drove me to rehab and I never got high since.  I just want to see those little stiff fingers trying to work a shotgun as five Jamaicans are  running at you with butcher knives.  That's it.  These aren't lies.  These are true. 
[01:12:00]  When David Spade started comedy, he came up from Arizona.  He was in New York.  He was just this timid little guy did props.  So we were doing a one-nighter in Jersey.  Me, Frankie, and him.  And he was just this little white kid from Arizona.  A little blind.  If Opie was 12, you know what I mean?  Just a little.  Yeah.  Hot.  You know.  So we do the gig.  We're driving back.  And we're driving back, you know, to drop him off in New York.  And me and Frankie, we go, well, look, we've got to make a stop first.  So I take him up. 
[01:12:30]  And this is, I take him to 160th, right?  You scumbag.  I'm getting out of the car.  This is true.  Someone's chasing another guy with a knife.  And he's scared.  And he goes, the guy's got a knife.  I go, he's not after me.  What do I care?  And get out.  Then Frankie, we take him down to the East Village where Frankie cops heroin.  Now Frankie's in the back seat.  Look at that ass.  And I'm driving him back.  And Frankie's, you know, shooting up.  What a great first experience. 
[01:13:00]  He's dead, right, Frankie?  Yeah, Frankie's dead.  Yeah, I don't know.  His father died.  Frankie was such a screw-up.  His father died.  Then two days later, he died.  So I didn't know what to do with him.  So they, you know, they cremated him.  And they just threw him in his father's casket under the pillow.  So, are you serious?  No.  Holy ass.  What did he die of?  Yeah, the guy was doing heroin forever.  Did he OD?  Oh.  I think he had a heart attack.  That's awful.  When did he die? 
[01:13:30]  You know, you know, when he stopped breathing.  No, what year?  Oh.  You did not just say that.  Funny.  Yeah, what year?  Only word.  I don't know.  He's thrown under the pillow.  Yeah, his father didn't know what to do with him.  Because they didn't want to have two funerals.  So they just put him under the pillow in his father's coffin.  That's how you know your family is sick of your drug use.  Nah, just throw him under the fucking pillow.  Put him under there and plant him with Dad.  Who cares?  Wow.  I hope I didn't bring everybody down with those.  No, that's a good story. 
[01:14:00]  Very interesting.  So it makes you never want to do drugs before?  You know what?  My weekend's boring.  I might have to ramp it up a little.  How did you do, like, six vials, though?  No, it's after, like, the first hit, it's pretty much over for the night.  Yeah, well, you're talking about it.  Yeah, can I ask that dumb question?  I've never, obviously, done that.  When you do one rock, like, how long are you high for?  You know what I mean?  You smoke one for a rush.  It's not really a high.  You get a rush.  It's like a rush.  Oh, so it doesn't last that long at all. 
[01:14:30]  No, no.  And then the rest of the night is spent trying to get the feeling that you got from the  first rush, but it never happens.  You got to, like, go to sleep, wait a whole day, get some more, and do it that way, although  I never smoked crack.  I never, uh, I'm one of those guys, look, I never smoked crack yet, right?  We used to free-based shit in the house.  We'd have, like, a chemistry set set up.  It's the same thing, though.  It was, no, it was ether and ammonia.  Oh, you did the ether.  And we'd put it in with the water.  You put the coke in.  And then you heat it up a little bit.  And then you take an eyedropper all the way down to the bottom of the vial. 
[01:15:00]  And then you pull out the, um, the ether.  Yeah.  And you spread it out on a slate.  And then you blow on it.  The ether evaporates immediately, and you're left behind with this white residue.  You scrape it up with a razor blade.  Look at Voss smiling.  This is so good.  He's smiling at me, like, this shit is so good.  Look at Voss.  And then you put it in the pipe.  Tell me again, but tell me slow.  You put it in the pipe on the screen, and then you give it a quick, like, with the heat  so it melts on the screen. 
[01:15:30]  And then you give it a hit.  And then you get that big rush.  It's like, whoa, man.  Holy shit.  You blow out.  Oh, man.  Wow.  And then it's done.  Look, Voss is sweating.  He's wiping his head.  He's sweating, and he has a boner.  Jesus.  My friend, my friend, I was on the road.  You know, I was doing comedy for, like, two years.  I was doing it, and I came home.  He goes, I'll get you high.  You know, we'll go out and party.  So he bought an eighth of Coke, right?  Okay, let me get this exactly right. 
[01:16:00]  An eighth was three and a half grams.  So he said, I'll sell a gram.  Oh, boy.  He said that to get, he said, I'll sell two and a half grams to get my money back.  It was $2.50, so, and then I'll give, we'll party with a gram.  So we party with a gram.  We're at my friend's house.  So he has the other two and a half grams, cutting half gram, five packages.  Five, you know.  This is math.  I'm already lost.  I know, I know.  Well, whatever.  Yeah, he's on a train heading north.  This is funny.  He had five half grams.  Okay.  And he fell asleep, and I knew where he hit him. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, yeah, scumbag.  So, like, I would take a half a gram, and I would cook it with the ammonia.  There was a way to cook it with the ammonia.  I'd pour the ammonia out and say, I'm not going to do this again.  Steal any more from him.  Right?  So time goes by.  I would steal another half a gram, drive to the store, and buy ammonia again.  Right?  I made four chips to the store for four different bottles of ammonia going, I have a cleaning  service.  I have a cleaning service, right?  Yeah, cleaning out your friend of his Coke. 
[01:17:00]  So I smoked all his Coke.  And I'm downstairs at my friend's house drinking a tall glass of vodka straight.  And I hear upstairs, someone yell, fuck.  Right?  I go, oh.  Oh, he knows.  He woke up.  Of course.  So he walks downstairs, he goes, I go, I sold it on credit for you.  Sold it on credit.  Look, I did you a favor.  I sold it and didn't get the money.  Yeah.  Guy's doing you a favor.  What a creep.  Yeah, he was doing a comedy show, and he's going to be on Sunday.  I'm going to get the money.  But let me, you know, all these stories, and I don't usually tell these stories because 
[01:17:30]  they're worth.  I'm coming up on 19 years clean.  So I'd like to get.  That's all I'd like to applaud every time.  That's our boy.  No, I'm not.  Here's the thing.  I don't want people to think, you know, I condone drug use.  Of course not.  Of course not.  You've seen the horrors of it.  You got lucky that you made it out of there.  Yeah, I mean, it's not an easy drug.  I think you should be dead.  I didn't say it, but.  Last time I did it was in the 80s.  You took some unbelievable chances there.  Like in the 80s.  86, I guess, 87 was the last time I did it.  It was, you know, everyone was doing it back then. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  We didn't know it was unsafe.  Yeah, they do it to be cool.  Be a part of the in-group.  That's right.  Be part of the members only.  Have your little brown vial with the spoon on the lid.  Sure.  The lesson here is that you've seen the good part of life, and you've seen the worser side  of it.  The worser.  You know, I mean, you know, stories.  I'm just saying, if you learn anything from these stories, you can get my DVD at richfloss.com.  That's right.  The inspirational DVD. 
[01:18:30]  If your kids are doing drugs, richfloss.com.  Better than Coke.  You could cut your Coke on it.  Yeah, yeah.  It has a hard top on it to make it a little bit easier.  It's all black, so you wouldn't lose any.  You could see your whole pile of clothes.  And it comes with a rolled-up dollar actually pushed into the side.  You could cut it up with the side of the actual DVD.  It's a whole Coke snorting kit.  That's a great idea.  The dollar rolled up.  What a great marketing thing.  That would be hilarious.  If I was a recovering addict, I would steal that and make a lot of money. 
[01:19:00]  Wow, boss.  Thanks for the radio, man.  Yeah, that was good.  Good.  I love old addict stories.  We're hanging with boss and John Heffron.  John Heffron's going to be at Caroline's all weekend long, starting tonight through Sunday.  You could call Caroline's at 212-757-4100 for tickets.  But limited shows.  You're not doing all shows, right, because of the festival.  Yeah, you've got to just call Caroline's to find the schedule.  I know tonight it's at, what, 11 o'clock?  Yeah, it's a later show.  Very funny, John Heffron.  Can I still have any Chicago next week?  No, you really can't.  Can I tell a story, though, about me and my friend? 
[01:19:30]  My friend worked at this funeral parlor, and we would smoke pot with the dead bodies,  and then go, you want some?  And then punch them in the head, and go, you can't have any.  You're dead.  That's one of my bits.  I know, Rich.  I know.  They photoshopped you.  Where can they find this?  On opianthony.com?  That's funny.  A whack bag?  All right, where can they find this?  Cage photoshopped.  And looking at it, Voss just opened his mouth and drooled. 
[01:20:00]  Nice to see 19 years clean has helped.  He fucking drooled.  He just drooled.  What the hell's wrong with you?  I don't know.  Hey, did you feel bad for attacking Dee Wallace and her son in that car?  Thank him.  Thank him.  Come on.  Good job.  Oh, God.  Who is that?  That's you.  That's you with dreadlocks. 
[01:20:30]  I don't know where they got that picture.  They've been using it a lot on Photoshop things.  I think that's a picture of me, you, and Chappelle, actually.  We took it to the cellar years ago, and your eyes are half closed, and your mouth is open in a horrible pose.  Really bad.  Look at those, how horrible those teeth look.  They had to color it out.  I know they had a yellow tooth.  It's a black and white picture.  Yeah, they did.  They colored in one of your teeth.  It's 7202, the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Can we do the ear thing?  Yeah, we'll do the ear any time.  It smells like grape jelly that bugs me.  I don't know what is behind this.  All right, who's going to take the ear thing today? 
[01:21:00]  Ben will do it.  Let's see.  Ben, do it.  I don't like it, Ben.  No.  It's grape jelly.  All right, who's going to do it?  One of our...  Did Steve do it last time?  Young, tender interns.  Yeah, Steve got some second whiff from him.  Eric did it.  I did it.  Have you ever done this?  I don't even know what it is.  You can tell he won't get sick.  You can tell.  That's why I won't care.  It smells like grape jelly.  It's like, what the fuck, what?  Hold on.  What is it, though?  I have enough...  And behind his ear it smells like stupid grape jelly.  Hold on, I have enough confidence.  I have enough confidence that we'll get a reaction out of him.  I don't think...  It smells like jelly.  We were in a parking lot at a train station and people were puking. 
[01:21:30]  We were laughing so hard.  The whole gag.  Well, we need to...  I think you had him.  We've got to get two people to get some.  John, you want in?  I've done it.  It's a little...  I've done it.  It's behind the ear and it's a cologne.  It's one of the worst smells you'll ever smell.  It's not bad.  It's a cologne mix and it smells like grape jelly and there's no reason for it.  You're a fucking...  Well, you've got to get jelly-headed asshole.  Let's get two people in.  All right.  Who else?  These guys are in time.  I don't want any karate guys.  Those two.  Oh, we've got a whole studio full of people that want to try this.  Eric, help us out with the mics. 
[01:22:00]  Who should I give it to you first?  Give it to us together.  I'll move.  Jim, everyone move mic.  Just grab that one, John.  Let me see if I have.  Everyone move over one.  All right.  Sex bagel, help him out.  All right.  Everyone on that mic.  Wait, we've got to explain this.  Yeah, so there's some kind of buildup behind Voss's ear.  And there's my left ear.  Huh?  My left ear.  Wait, is he going to do it first?  I don't know.  Well, let him go first.  Yeah, but the last one's always the worst.  No, I've got enough, I think.  All right, all right.  I don't know.  All right. 
[01:22:30]  Ready?  Because he could describe it much better.  Oh, I do.  I do have to.  Let me know.  Oh, God.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  No, wait a second.  No, wait, no.  Okay, so that's all you're going to do is scratch it and then sniff it.  Yeah.  This isn't like you trick me.  No, no, no.  There's no trick.  I sniff you and then you kiss me when I'm that close.  It's not one of those things.  John, you've got to do it.  You better hurry up.  It's going.  All right.  This is what I do for face value.  John, into the microphone. 
[01:23:00]  Let the look on John's face.  What do you think?  Get some more, he says.  What do you think?  You know what it smells like?  I dated a girl who was a bulimic who threw up.  You know how when your body starts to rot from the inside?  That's what that smells like.  I did see it.  It was revulsion that that came from a human being.  Right. 
[01:23:30]  Hefron was taken back.  All comedic instincts went away.  It was like an animal.  That smell should not come from a living human being.  Isn't that unbelievable?  Isn't that unbelievable, though, John?  We have that on film.  We'll put it up.  Is there?  We'll put that up on poundrymusic.com and opianthony.com.  Is there a scratch and sniff on your DVD?  Wait, let me see.  Let me see.  That's what's behind your ear?  I know.  He wiped it on his DVD. 
[01:24:00]  And it actually made the DVD smell better.  Now I won't get it for a couple days, like a week.  That's unbelievable, isn't it?  Get away from me.  Get away from me.  But you don't smell like I've stood around you.  You don't have that smell about you.  No, not at all.  Anthony's so skeeved out.  I love it.  There.  Yeah.  So I waited.  But there, you know, I was coming in, so I let it build up a little.  I'm just going to wash your hands.  Put some of that stuff on your hands.  Is that from the drugs, maybe?  Put some of that stuff on your hands. 
[01:24:30]  No, no.  What is it from, Voss?  That's not disinfectant.  Yeah, it is.  It will take it off his hands.  Voss, what is it from again?  Well, you spray it into his hands.  So his finger doesn't touch the top of it.  It's from what?  It's hands-free.  He'll explain.  Smell it.  It's hands-free soap.  Like, it's hands-free soap.  No one wants to get near his hands now.  All right, Voss, what is it again?  What is that?  Can you shoot that stuff up my nose?  Voss, get on mic.  What is that?  What is what?  It's hands-free soap.  No, no.  Hands-free soap.  Why?  My hands-free soap. 
[01:25:00]  No, Voss, the ear thing.  What is it?  It's, I think, from when I was young, not young, in high school or something, I had a  cyst.  And the cyst was, you know, and then I guess it just, the...  What was in it?  Shit?  At least I didn't just wash my hands with something that does require water, stupid.  I didn't read, oh, so what, because I didn't read the label?  Oh, I'm using it, too.  He's tricked me with a prompt.  I'm like, yeah, yeah, it's a...  Would they have a water...  Oh, no, no, they're sticky. 
[01:25:30]  Does it work?  It wasn't that bad today, though, did it?  No, that was bad.  We got some good reactions today.  Did you see his face?  Yeah, Jon Hepburn's face was great.  Yeah, because I didn't know, because...  Yeah, because I thought maybe it was a joke you guys played, and you stick your finger in  my face or something like that, and then, so then when I actually smelled that, that  bad...  His belly button's pretty bad, too.  Not as bad as that.  I have to have a load my belly button the night before and then fall asleep.  You have to have a load?  Oh.  So...  If I...  When I got Bob Belly...  Doesn't it usually land on your chin to load?  No, he talked about this.  It hits the back wall.  It does have a good range. 
[01:26:00]  That would...  That wouldn't have been...  All right.  Go ahead.  Tell us about your belly button.  No, I just want that chin line to sit there.  Hurts, doesn't it, Rich?  That smells different than, like, I've...  Like, cut my toenails, and, you know, I'm that guy.  Like, I'll cut it, and then...  Or if you scoop it out, you'll sometimes smell it.  Yeah.  You know the stuff that gets in the corners of your toes?  You smell it when you're by yourself, just to kind of see.  But that's a different smell than that, even.  Even in toe crud.  You know?  That's...  If he put his hand in a bowl of maggots, they would fucking slither away. 
[01:26:30]  I almost said they would ride away, and I'm glad I corrected myself.  Yah!  Yah!  Maggots ride!  This is Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing Season 1 and Season 3.  I was the guy who didn't win.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My wife and I first moved to California.  She was hammering on me about going on one of these whale-watching trips.  Let's get in the boat and go see the whales.  Let's go see the whales.  I'm like, no!  It's a 60-foot animal wearing a 6-foot rubber boat wear a bath toy.  No. 
[01:27:00]  Well, she finally talked me into going.  She hadn't talked me into going.  She just said, you're going.  I said, hey!  Sounds good.  So the day of the trip, I'm just whining and moaning.  I don't want to go.  And we're going with these two other California couple friends of ours who are nice people.  But one of the guys is like one of these surfer guys.  He doesn't have a job.  I don't know what he does.  But he thinks I'm his friend because I cut him down.  So we get down on the docks, and this guy is like right in my face.  Like, Bill, dude, all right?  Listen up. 
[01:27:30]  Do you know what would like totally make my day?  I'm like, a G-E-D?  Is that a band?  Dude, if we were out in that boat, all right, this would be so righteous.  If we were out in that boat, and a whale went right by the boat, just jumped right by the boat.  That would make my day.  I go, do you know what would make my day?  A gun barrel in my mouth.  So we get out in this boat, and surf boy gets his wish.  Out of nowhere, this humongous whale comes up right by the boat and goes, 
[01:28:00]  and sprays this nasty liquid all over the boat.  And the Californians are freaking.  They're like, oh my God, he sprayed it.  That is so cool.  I'm like, hello?  He just blew his nose on us.  This is what he did.  We just paid 200 bucks apiece to have a whale honk a loogie on us.  That's all we did.  You know what? 
[01:28:30]  Give me the 200 bucks.  And then the whale made a noise.  It went like, and they lost it.  They're screaming, what do you say?  What do you say?  What do you say?  I'm like, he says, that's what he said.  Which means I just blew snot on him.  I'm going to go tell my friends.  I just get on my nerves.  And it ain't really the tellers.  I'm just doing my job, sir.  I am just doing my job.  Well, you're sucking at it, lady. 
[01:29:00]  I'll say that.  Well, I've been at Amoco all night.  And now I'm here working at the bank in my other job.  I bounced a check for $3.  Charged me 30 bucks for a $3 check.  Now, if I ain't got three, I damn sure ain't got 33.  This just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  I had a bank in Atlanta charge you $3 to check the balance in your savings account.  In other words, you walk in and go, 
[01:29:30]  How much money I got in this account?  Oh, $300.  Well, $297.  So what you're saying is if I ask you another 99 times how much money I got, I'll be broke before you go to lunch.  That's what you're saying.  It's a sorry world.  It's everything 24-7.  XM 202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Let's say hi to Krista.  Hey, Krista.  Hi, how are you?  Okay, what's going on?  You make me feel so young, Krista.  What's up, Krista?  You make me feel so sprung and...  Atta, girl.  What's up, Krista?  What's up, Krista?  Um, well, basically, you guys, those comedy bits, you know, during the breaks, that's, like, awful.  Yeah, we know that.  Yeah, we know.  Yeah, it's really bad.  Yeah.  You know, why don't you guys play the, um, you know, that segment that we just had? 
[01:30:30]  I don't think you guys should cut it.  It was actually pretty funny.  What segment?  Which one?  The one with the girls with the video games.  The girls?  Yeah.  Oh, the sweetest chicks.  Oh, thank you.  All right, we'll keep it in the replay.  What the hell?  I think it's funny.  Is that why you're calling, though?  Well, um, actually, I called to ask, you know, about the breaks, and I basically, you know,  spoke with the DJs behind the scenes.  All right.  Are you blind?  Yes, I am.  Oh!  And I had to find the phone number, and I couldn't find it.  How'd you find it? 
[01:31:00]  Oh, I gotta go.  Why?  Why?  Is that your dog barking?  Because the bus is, because I'm going to be late for the bus, basically.  Where are you going today?  School.  School.  You hope.  Jesus.  Oh, that's awful.  That is awful.  We like Krista.  I gotta go.  All right, Krista.  Thank you.  All right.  Skipping through the field and tripping over things that you can't see.  When you're seeing, when you're seeing. 
[01:31:30]  You make me feel your face so I can see what you look like.  You guys are awful.  You make me feel the raised letters.  Forget me not, you sightless taut.  Your dog just shit on my rug. 
[01:32:00]  Jesus.  It's a very angry show today.  That's harsh.  Wow.  All right.  Let's go to Jay in Cleveland.  Hey, Jay.  Yeah.  Jay.  I wonder if y'all can read Braille.  No.  We can't read Braille, no.  Damn, I had a Braille tape measure on the side of my cock I needed you to read.  Oh.  It sounds like you're a little pissed off at the blind humor, sir.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I sound like a couple big old fat pussies sitting up there. 
[01:32:30]  I was a little offended by it, too, to tell you the truth.  I don't mind the criticism, but could you not breathe heavily into the phone, you southern  fatso?  He's in Cleveland.  Wherever he is, he's got a dumb southern accent, and he's breathing heavy.  I got a little.  I shouldn't be able to tell how fat you are by listening to you on the phone, stupid.  I can slobber on the back of your neck, too, motherfucker, while I'm holding you down.  Mother.  Mother.  You sound half southern and half golfer, sir. 
[01:33:00]  What are you?  I don't use grease.  Isn't this the dude from the prank call today?  Hey, did we repossess your car?  You concrete walkers.  Hey, shitty, shitty folks.  I don't like to shoe-wearing shitty people.  Put the chocolate pad on that ass.  So you're blind, Jay?  Yeah.  He's not blind.  No, he's blind.  He can tell.  How can you tell?  I don't know.  How can you?  Because someone who...  Yeah, you're right. 
[01:33:30]  You can't tell.  I thought I had to read it.  How do you know you're in Cleveland if you're blind?  Well, uh...  Good question.  You could call on the phone and call the area code for Cleveland and see if, uh...  Yeah, no.  That's true.  You could write a letter to yourself and write the zip code to Cleveland and see if you get it.  Or you could stand outside of the local baseball park in October, and if you hear no noise,  you're probably in Cleveland.  Or you could go to Baltimore, and if you see your team playing there, then you could realize that you're probably in Cleveland. 
[01:34:00]  Or you could stand outside a building that should have Black Sabbath in it, but instead they have fucking Aerosmith, and then realize you're in Cleveland.  Or you could look for white people and see nothing but 5,000 black guys standing in a bus stop with baseball bats.  Then you know you're in Cleveland.  Sir, that was called being on a roll.  You have to pull...  You may be blind, but are you deaf with no comedic timing either?  You fucking...  You leukemia of comedy?  Feel the bumps on those balls and tell them what flavor they are with your tongue. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, jeez.  This is what happens...  This is what happens when guys...  What do you have to do with this guy?  She is all over your face, and you know it.  Sir, you should say waka waka after every joke, you fatso waka waka.  There you go.  You should have that noise coming out of your blowhole, fat boy.  Ah, you big old fat pussy.  Thanks.  Go get some exercise.  Wow, he really got you on that one, I think.  Go get some exercise.  And you know what?  Y'all ain't got no women up there. 
[01:35:00]  Why?  Why?  Because you sit around and plant your booties in the mirror.  Did you just say booties, grown man?  Yeah, you're playing with your booty in the mirror.  Sticking bananas up your ass.  All right, thank you.  We're going to give Cleveland a chance to...  Bye, Gay Blaze.  You make me feel like going to Cleveland and switching your furniture around in your house.  He's not blind.  I hope he is blind, though, so he can kneel down and drink out of the bidet. 
[01:35:30]  Take a nice sip.  Why does my water have, like, corn and little flecks of food in it?  Let's go to Krista on Long Island.  Krista.  Krista.  Krista, the blind chick checking in.  You're blind?  Yes.  We remember that.  Yes, okay, well...  Wait, wait, what's the story about Krista?  I don't remember Krista.  I remember her being blind.  Where are you right now?  Long Island.  How do you know?  You think you're on Long Island.  Okay, I wanted to know if Norton had any... 
[01:36:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I want to know how we know you.  Yeah, we need a little...  Oh, because I was the...  I called in on the air, and I was the...  Basically, Norton was singing, uh, You Sightless Twat.  Oh!  Oh, is that you?  Your dog just shit on my rug.  Yeah, that was it.  You're the inspiration for that?  Yeah, I'm the inspiration for that.  Oh, my God.  We're talking to someone famous.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  My little hands just can't reach my long, misshapen, ruining-the-family-photographs face. 
[01:36:30]  And you were blind since when?  Since birth.  Since birth, so it doesn't matter to you, right?  Well, I mean, it would be cool to see and everything, but...  Yeah, you don't really care, though.  Yeah, but what is seeing?  Do you even know what it means?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, technically, I don't know what...  Well, I want to know what Norton looks like, why he can't get a date, like a real girl to  bang him.  Well, I mean, it wouldn't matter what I look like to you, because you never had sight,  so just for you, everything is touch. 
[01:37:00]  Well, that's true.  Picture a marshmallow with an appendix scar in the middle, a mediocre head with no chin  on top, and picture two fine bowling pin calves with the penis of a four-year-old boy  in between them, and then you've gotten me.  That's what I would feel like if I was laying nude on a cushion and you were putting your  hands all over me.  What about your boobies?  Yes, I have fine B-cups that you could mush and massage.  I'd love to see her come up and touch her face like that scene in Mask. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, God.  Then you watch her just go, watch me go pull pins out, and she says she won't go to Europe  with me.  A little tear, and you pull the pins out of that map.  That's right.  Ben Sparks decides not to go.  Can't go.  He's having cock reduction surgery.  Oh, God.  Are you married, or...  No.  You got a boyfriend?  I have a boyfriend, yes.  You have a boyfriend.  Can he see?  No.  No?  Well, he has some vision. 
[01:38:00]  Wow, that's going to just be a mess.  How do you guys meet?  You just walk down the block and yell, Marco.  Yeah, how did two hook up at a blind thing?  We actually met at a summer camp.  A blind summer camp?  Uh-huh.  That's great.  A summer camp for the visually impaired, and that was like ages ago, so we've been friends  for years and years.  How old are you?  I am 20.  Oh, wow.  She's only 20 years old.  Are you hot?  I don't know. 
[01:38:30]  I have no clue.  Well, what...  People say I'm hot.  Well, how tall are you?  I'm 5'4".  How much do you weigh?  120.  They're being polite.  What?  Oh, so job.  How do you know you weigh 120?  Because I go on the scale.  How else would I know?  And the doctor...  Hold on, hold on.  You weigh 120 pounds.  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be a talking scale, right?  Can you hear my screen reader say all kinds of dirty stuff?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:39:00]  You got a screen reader?  Go ahead.  Yeah, okay.  Let's hear what fun they've invented for the blind.  I have to shut off...  I have to shut off XM Radio Online.  I have to open up Microsoft Word.  And if I lived with her, I would put a brick on the scale.  Oh, that would be really funny.  Oh, that's awful.  You weigh 192 pounds.  What?  Stop eating.  Can you guys hear the screen reader at all?  Try it again.  All right.  Let's see. 
[01:39:30]  Let's see.  Come on.  Oh, I have to type some stuff and then slow it down for you guys.  It sounded like it was trying to eat your pussy.  Jesus.  Well, yeah, that's because I have it so fast.  Let's see.  I'm trying to type something interesting.  What do you want the screen reader to say, you guys?  Hey, Ben, is that a Haitian family in your pants or are you happy to see me? 
[01:40:00]  Let's see.  How do I get to say Haitian?  I don't know.  No, that's not going to work.  Can you spell AIDS?  No, I'm trying to figure it out.  What did you say is a Haitian family in Japan?  In your pants.  In your pants.  In Japan.  What are you, deaf tool?  Yeah, take it easy, deafy.  I can't believe blindy and deafy.  Okay, here we go.  Here we go.  Let's listen to this here. 
[01:40:30]  Why?  That talks too fast.  Oh, okay.  I got to slow it down.  Yeah.  For you guys, you're not used to riding the fast lane here.  Wow, you understand it that fast.  Okay, how's this?  Real slow.  Hey, Ben.  Is that Haitian family in your pants?  I kind of heard that.  How about, hey, Ben, nice big cock.  Big.  You heard big.  Hi.  KC.  Oops.  Okay, here we go.  Hey, Ben, nice big cock. 
[01:41:00]  All right.  We will never grow up.  I love that they invent this technology to help visually impaired people,  and it's being used for a dick joke.  How about this?  Yeah, well, you can go on pdaudio.net.  There's like an awesome, it's an awesome website about where this blind guy,  he did deck talk, which is a synthesizer,  and he did all kinds of, like, bits with the synthesizer. 
[01:41:30]  We'll check it out.  Can you say this?  Can you say this?  Hey, Gravy Leg, the Patriots suck.  Look how fast he types, huh?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Hey, Gravy Leg, the Patriots suck all.  Hey, Gravy Leg.  Can you slow it down slightly or no?  Yeah, it's already really, really slow, but I'll slow it down.  Slow for you.  And then maybe just a little more volume. 
[01:42:00]  A little more volume.  A little more volume.  I'm very lucky.  I'm actually, uh...  Something about Ben and his big duties.  My mom's not home here, so I can do this.  Let's see.  All right.  How do you know?  I could slow it down.  You left foot.  You hear that one?  Yeah.  How about one more?  How about, um...  Let's see.  Me?  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben, your big duties are blocking the highway.  Hey, Ben, your big duties are blocking the highway. 
[01:42:30]  We've got to make promos with this thing.  Yep.  How fast can it talk?  Like, you're slowing it down for us.  How fast can it talk?  Uh, you want it to talk really fast?  The way you listen to it under normal circumstances.  All right.  Hold on a second.  Well, I've...  I've got to get it to slow down somehow.  I mean, to speed up again.  This is a hard goal. 
[01:43:00]  Manic.  Oh, I can't get it to speed up because I don't have enough, like...  All right.  ...get a text.  It was hard enough.  Let's see.  Wow.  Is that a cute hearing?  You don't understand that, do you?  Yes.  I do understand.  What does it say?  It actually said I'm speeding it up to normal volume.  I wrote volume instead of, like, rate, but, oh, well, just because I'm a twat. 
[01:43:30]  Jesus.  All right.  So, um, what do you want to ask Jimmy today?  Well, I wanted to ask him what he looked like.  Well, we got that.  You got that.  And I wanted to know if he's had any more run-ins with, uh, the hoes of the evening.  Yeah, I've had a few.  I mean, I've been better than normal.  Like, a lot of times I can hold off and just, you know, throw in a porn.  But, uh, yeah, I've had a few.  You mean like Max Core or something?  Max Hardcore, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You like porno?  Well, obviously I can't like porno. 
[01:44:00]  Well, you can listen to it, I guess.  There's not really much to listen to, is there?  Are you completely, like, can't see anything blind?  Basically, yeah.  Answer, this is the way we should ask it.  I mean, like, I maybe can see a little light, but that's about it.  Would a lineup do you any good?  A what?  A lineup in a police precinct.  A lineup?  Oh, you mean like to identify somebody?  Yeah.  Yes.  Ah, blind enough.  There you go, Opie.  I mean, I could recognize voices.  If the guy's tough enough, I'd obviously, uh...  Have it all figured out. 
[01:44:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Maybe he just had that machine.  Take off your pants.  He won't get hurt.  All right, hold on.  I'll get to say that.  I love how she types.  It's amazing.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Take off your pants.  You won't get hurt.  I'll read your mother's back to basketball.  Wow.  Your machine has Parkinson's. 
[01:45:00]  Okay, I'll flow it down so you can understand it.  Take off your pants.  You won't get hurt.  I'll read your mother's back to basketball.  Hey, can you make it go  Hold on a sec  Little humiliated fingers  Alright, let's see  That's about all it's gonna do  Not too cool  That's fantastic  Well, Christy, you're a lot of fun, man  Thanks  You gotta come in one time

[01:51:00]  Okay  It's already gearing up to be gay  You're in second gay gear  It's beyond gay, I'm gonna admit it  I'm not gay  Of course  But it's gonna be hard to defend the story, okay  I hope this doesn't go by the way where I sense it might be going  What?  I just don't like this  I'm having a feeling too  Oh, it's awful  It's awful  I'm definitely throwing myself in the barrel here  I meant to tell this story a long time ago  So, you know, Jay was visiting or whatever  And it was the Survivor finale 
[01:51:30]  And it was a cold, rainy night  Ooh  And we decide, you know, to get some takeout  Some cheese and crackers  Wait a minute  Crack open a bottle of wine  I'm telling you  I'm telling you, it's gay crap  You could stop right there  Alright  And it's already  Alright, I guess I will  Really gay  Do you want to hear more or not?  Of course  Alright  We go through the supermarket to get all this stuff  We're planning just a mellow night, you know  In front of the TV to watch the Survivor finale, okay? 
[01:52:00]  Two men, some wine, an afghan  Dude, trust me  Cheese, crackers, no dried sausage  Or did you bring that yourselves?  It's awful  Shut up  So, we're going up and down the aisles  And I'm like, hey Jay, I got a fireplace that I've never used, right?  So, they got the door of flames?  Yeah  Not only do they have the door of flame logs  By the way, after I tell the story, I will not be reading my email for two to three days, okay?  Alright  So, good luck trying to abuse me  And I'm not reading any message boards 
[01:52:30]  And I'm not even going to answer the phones  Oh, okay  So, we see the pile of door of flame logs  But right next to it are java logs  What is a java log?  Java logs are like door of flame logs  But they give the smell of coffee in your apartment when you're burning them  Are you kidding?  And I love my coffee, so I'm like, hey, let's try the java log  Why not get a door of flame and make some coffee?  Why is my coffee spilled everywhere?  You sure it's not a java log? 
[01:53:00]  She spilled my java log  What the hell is this?  This is not what I ordered  You bitch  This is not even close to what I ordered  Uh-oh  Kathy Diva  Look at this thing  Wow, it's filled up to the tippity top  Look at it, it's spilling all over the console  Like, I don't know if it's possible  But I think there's just too much liquid in here  And it's now trying to escape  Did one of the savage deli people that work in this fine city 
[01:53:30]  One of those savage Middle Easterns  No, it's a Starbucks  Dude, it doesn't look like Starbucks  What is this?  I ordered a cappuccino  Oh, you did?  A 2% cappuccino  Sorry, I heard the grande skin thing  What, did they put both in the cup?  No, I  The thing is overflowing  I over-latte'd it  I guess  Ah  We'll go fix that  I don't know what this is  It's a coffee  But thank you for the effort  I really appreciate it  No problem  Maybe he's got other things on his mind  This is the new friendlier Opie 
[01:54:00]  Having sex with porn stars or something  Alright, so  How's that going?  Still going?  Yeah, we've kind of moved on  I'm banging other girls  She's banging hundreds of other guys  Oh  It's in the past  Maybe next month  I'll have an update for you  Alright, sorry to hear that  No, it's alright  I'm in for the show  Oh, yeah  Fair enough  I like the new friendlier Opie  If someone spills your coffee  I pardon you  I pardon you

[01:55:30]  And get comfortable  You know  Oh, jeez  Oh, I know  It just keeps going  So I don't have sweats  I have some flannel PJs on  I'm like  Well, no one's going to  This is the key to the story  I'm like  Ah, no one's going to see me  It's just Jay  I've known him forever  Yeah  Ant's known him forever  Look how I'm like  Help  Sure  I'm just praying  That you're going to help me out  A little bit here  I've always been completely  Dressed around Jay  Well, so have I  But I just happen to have  Flannel PJs on  Alright  And the wine's flowing  And Survivor's on 
[01:56:00]  And  Cheese and crackers  Cheese and crackers  And the java log  And all of a sudden  And all of a sudden  Jay's like  Hey  Is it getting smoky in here  Or is it my imagination  I'm like  What?  So I look in the distance  And you can kind of see  The smoke  A little haze  A little haze up high  Right  So I'm like  Oh my god  Was the flume open  Closed  What the F  Right  So I  You know  I opened it or closed it  I don't know what I did  To hopefully get this smoke out  Because obviously  Something's not working right 
[01:56:30]  Uh huh  So whatever I did  Made it  So much worse  So now the smoke  Is just pouring out  Of the fireplace  Into my apartment  Now it's getting pretty bad  It's getting serious  Uh oh  So then I decide  Oh fuck  So I decided  To try to take  The door flame log  And throw it out  In my backyard  And as I'm trying  To get it out  Of the fireplace  The whole thing explodes  Making more fire  And smoke  What do you mean  Like it did a crackle thing  Yeah it's all chemical  So it kind of just fell apart  And now it's just like  Now it's flaming  Alright  Yeah so is the situation 
[01:57:00]  Around your apartment  Dude  No  Wait for the punchline  So  So I'm like  Jay  Holy crap  Now we got a problem  Now the smoke  Is just flying out  Of the fireplace  Dark and thick  And going right up  To the ceiling  I mean it is bad  No exaggeration  So now I open  All the windows  Open my back door  To my outdoor part there  I'm just hearing jokes  And jokes  With every word  Oh I know  I opened my back door  Big black and thick  Right  You know you're saying  Things that just 
[01:57:30]  Conjure an image  If it wasn't so early  In LA  We'd have to get  Jay on the phone  Maybe we'll get him  On the phone tomorrow  So  So I'm like  Jay there's a fan  Downstairs  Go get it  So he grabs the fan  The windows are open  It's freezing out  The door's open  Now we got the fan  Now we're just  Blowing all this  All this  All this black  Dark smoke  Out of the apartment  Right  Right  And I'm like  Oh my god  What are we gonna do  Now we're just  Running around  Trying to figure this out  Because I can't get  I can't get the door  Flame out  Right  So all of a sudden 
[01:58:00]  I'm downstairs  I forgot  Trying to find  Another fan  Or something  And all of a sudden  Do do do do do  Banging on the door  Really hard  Jay's like  From upstairs  He goes  Should I get that  I'm like  Yeah I guess  I don't know  Who's stopping by  But yeah  Grab it  Right  So it opens up  The door  The fire department  There you go  Yeah  But they weren't  Real firemen  They were  Chippendales dancers  And they threw  Up their helmets  Dude 
[01:58:30]  So the fire department  Comes barging in  In full gear  With the oxygen on  The mask  Everything  I mean everything  Wow  Isn't that amazing  That the people  Actually in the apartment  Weren't the ones  They called  It got that bad  No it was really bad  You know I'm not kidding  Obviously the neighbors  Ratted me  Turns out  You know I went out  The front door  And there were like  Three or four fire trucks  On my block  Closed off the whole street  They thought there was  Just a massive fire  Going on  Because of the smoke 
[01:59:00]  Just two guys  Eating some cheese  And crackers  So there's three or four  Fire department guys  You know  In full gear  That looked like  They just walked off  One of those stupid  Calendars they sell  Every year  You know just big  Tough burly guys  In their steer  Buff  Shut up  And there  There I am  In my PJ's  Anthony  Couple glasses of wine  On the  You know  Near the couch  It looks real bad  For you  It looks horrendous  Because remember  Going back in the story 
[01:59:30]  I said  I said that  That  That  That  I didn't think  Anyone was going to  See me this way  Of course  So you do things  When you don't  You know what I mean  You're like  Yeah whatever  Who's really going to  See me  So there's three or four  Guys in there  And we're looking  Just really bad  And faggy  And right next  To my fired up  Places  There's a picture  Of Kurt Cobain  In makeup  I'm sure that  Didn't help the  Situation right  So all of a sudden  They're staring  At the apartment  They see it's a  Door flame log  Right  And Jay and I  At this point  Are trying to look  Tough like 
[02:00:00]  It was a  Door flame log  But we got it  Under control sir  Or whatever  You know  And they're like  They're on their  Walkie talkies  Like ah god  It's just a 202  Or whatever  They say  202 is fire  In a fag's apartment  Yeah exactly  That's what Jay said  You know  It's gotta be  Yeah  Yeah you boys  Have fun now  Yeah cause they're  On their walk  It's only a 202  You know  Sorry it's Jesus  And they're all pissed off  Cause they were ready  To like you know  Do some serious  Firefighting you know  Of course  And they walk  Out of the apartment  And Jay and I  Look at each other  Like holy ass

[02:08:30]  After 9-11  And really  Put forth a song  That could capture  The emotions  And what we were  Feeling  Ugh  All of them sucked  We actually played  A bunch of them  On the air  And tried to figure out  What cornball lines  They were going to  Try to rhyme with  Another  You just hit the nail  On the head  Because there was  Two guys  That actually wrote  Songs  And it also says  Both men  Previously wrote  Musical tributes  About other  Tragic events  Strand  A guard at  Dual vocational  Institution  At Tracy  Composed 
[02:09:00]  Song for America  A patriotic  Folk song  Four days  After September 11  Four days  Ugh  They just want  To be involved  And they want  People to look  For them  As passionate  Artists  Yeah  And you're all  Over 40  And you failed  Failed  Performers  Miserably  Failed  Those songs  They were rhyming  Like I don't know  Shame  And plane  Tower  And power  Tower  But we have  The power  Oh  And we were just

The baby's t-shirts  Oh, I think so  Somewhere in this pile  Because I was laughing at the fact that they were outraged by the one that they used as an example  Shock and awe for baby t-shirts? 
[02:20:30]  Baby t-shirts  Now these kind of risque, kind of shocking t-shirts are available for little infants, for babies now  And they're kind of funny sayings  With titles like Hot Babe, Mommy's Little Monster, Diva, Serial Killer  Cereals felt like cereal, like, you know, we eat cereal  Yeah  10% soft spot, 90% bitch  There you go  Is that a shirt?  Yes, it is  Well, according to me now it is  That's very funny 
[02:21:00]  I just chimed in with that and made it up  That's a good one  Thank you  But, you know, I was reading their examples  And there's an outrage because of these shirts  But the examples they give are nothing compared to some of them I've seen  Well, here's one that they're really pissed off at, a t-shirt that says  Bitch, better have my bottle  Oh, that must get them angry  And Sir Crapsalot  Sir Crapsalot, that's kind of funny  They're among the hottest sellers  You don't like Sir Crapsalot?  No, I don't, just say Ben on it 
[02:21:30]  There's another baby t-shirt, Anthony  Yeah  That says, my mom puts out  Wow  I like that  Now, I've never seen these  And then the mom is, of course, saying  But I'll bet my husband wishes it was true  And the one that was tasteless, that one from California  There was only the one kid that wore it  And it just said, glub, glub, glub, glub, glub, glub  You're so obsessed

[02:22:30]  And another t-shirt, Anthony  That says, where's all the bitches at?  Where's all the bitches at?  Now you're saying these shirts are tame  Compared to the other ones that you've seen out there?  One of my favorite sites  Is t-shirthell.com  Okay  You ever go there?  No  Very funny t-shirts  And they have a whole baby section  And these are much better than the ones they give examples for 
[02:23:00]  Imagine you're a little toddler  Wearing a shirt that says  Now that I'm safe, I'm pro-choice  Now that's kind of funny  I tore mommy a new one  Another one reads  Chinese delicacy  Do they cook, child?  Did you get this one, Anthony?  Now that I'm safe, I'm pro-choice  Yes, that's the one I just read  Oh, I'm sorry  Well, because someone was distracting me  Oh my god, that's hysterical  I have no idea

Well, you guys don't understand  During the radio show  I'm taking my headphones off  Turning microphones off  Giving instructions  Receiving communiques  This one's cool  I tore mommy a new one  Alright, I heard that one, you ass  You're coming off as an insane person  Today  I know  Whose roll-aids are these?  Roll-aids in my studio  You'll be dearest 
[02:24:00]  Tina, get the suntan lotion  You know there are times during the show  I'm taking my headphones off  Turning microphones off  And trying to find other stuff  Yeah  To enhance some of these bits that we do  Right  So I got caught  I got caught napping on that one  I'm sorry  How about this one?  Fuck the milk, where's the whiskey tips?  There you go  You're a little toddler being  Yeah, that's a real one  You could buy it  Did you say the one  I pray you didn't  They shake me?  No, I didn't say that  How funny is that as a shirt for you little kid? 
[02:24:30]  That's a little crazy  Kid walking around with a  They shake me t-shirt  Yeah  How about Daddy drinks because I cry?  Did you do that one?  No, no  I didn't do that one  I enjoy a good spanking  Playground pimp  Daddy's milk is saltier than mommy's  That is not a t-shirt  This one has a big pot leaf on the front  And it's a little t-shirt for your baby  And it says potty head  You know, a little play on pot head 
[02:25:00]  Potty head  Did you read the one hung like a five-year-old?  That's very funny  Daddy's lil squirt  And it says L-I-L  It's spelled lil  What about this one?  It just says broken condom  Hmm  Those are funny shirts  Oh, my IQ is higher than the president's  The old I can kick your baby's ass 
[02:25:30]  Yeah  Those are a little more offensive than the examples they gave  And I hide my crack in my diaper  Oh, there's one from  This is a weird one  If you're in Florida in 1981  Don't lose your head  Oh, my God  Oh, my God  Then there's ones  T-shirt hell is great  They have t-shirts for everybody  Not just for kids 
[02:26:00]  Mm-hmm  There are some really, really offensive ones  Arrest black babies before they become criminals  I mean  That's what it says  I thought it was a voice post  Who the hell would get that?  This one, really offensive  You know the I Love New York shirts?

[02:27:30]  Norton, read it  Where is it?  It's right here  Norton will take pleasure in reading it  I guarantee  It's this one  No, it's not  Oh, jeez  He's laughing  You're not gonna read it?  Of course I'm gonna read it  I just did one  Is it a ton?  Yeah  Love him or hate him  Hitler killed a ton of Jews  Holy yes  Are you insane?  Who's walking around with that?  Yeah  Byron 
[02:28:00]  Picture of Hitler  Right, Byron from yesterday  Sure  All right, here's the story of the day  Canine used to subdue naked suspect  Tuesday afternoon around 12.05  There was a man  A stark naked man  Checking for unlocked doors  Completely naked  Going from home to home, right?  There you go  He found one at Craig Martinson's home  I know he scattered a bunch of laundry around  I know he was on all floors  What does that mean?  What does that mean? 
[02:28:30]  Either he was on all fours  And they made a mistake  Or he was on all the floors  Of this guy's house  Either way it's a mistake though  Like if he was in the basement  All right, so the guy broke into a home  Maybe everywhere he walked was a floor  The guy broke into a home  He was stark naked, okay?  A half dozen cops were on the naked man's trail  Including an officer with a canine named Zach  The cops spotted the naked man inside this guy's home  And ordered him outside  At that point, the suspect leaped toward the canine officer  And punched the canine officer in the head 
[02:29:00]  Bad move  That is not a good move  Bad move  These dogs are vicious  Doing what the dog is trained to do  Protect the handler  The dog jumped and bit the suspect  In the genitals  Ow!  In this case, the genitals  That's correct  One neighbor says she watched  As police appear to recover  Part of the man's testicles  From the porch area of the home  Oh, no!  The dog bit his balls  Right off him  Just think you're a dog  That dangling meat 
[02:29:30]  It's a perfect target  And to rip a piece off for a dog  Is nothing  That's nothing  It's just hanging there  Minneapolis police say  Their canine officers  Are never trained to attack the genitals  But suspects usually aren't naked either  Anthony  As the neighbor across the street told us  Who happens to  Council member what?  Scott Pent  That doesn't make sense either  Well, whatever  This seems to be an incident without precedent  It's highly unusual 
[02:30:00]  Don't have much criminal activity  Since I moved here 15 years ago  So, obviously  The neighbor has never seen a naked guy  Get his testicles  Bitten off by a canine dog  Yeah  Basically what's going on there  Right?  And the suspect is in serious stable condition  Police are investigating  Whether the suspect was on drugs  I like this part  Go ahead  Even after the canine bit the suspect  Right in the junk  Minneapolis police say  Officers still tasered the suspect several times  There you are  You're a bleeding sack 
[02:30:30]  Because it was bitten off by a dog  And you get a little taser action too  You're laying on the ground  Just hoping the dog doesn't swallow it  Zach, the canine  Has a clean record  But is off the street  Pending the outcome of an investigation  Why?  The dog was doing his job  Well, now they'll probably have to shoot the dog, right?  Is that what?  I would  That's what we do in this society  If I was the owner, I'd shoot him  You're not going to go home and go  Give me kisses  Give me kisses, Zach 
[02:31:00]  Licking you with man-testicle breath  Mike in Jersey, what's up?  Mike  Hey, uh, Ope  Yeah  Hi, boys  Listen, I actually read in the paper  They're getting rid of the dog  Oh, yeah?  And, yeah, the way they're doing it  Is they're actually sending him to Opie's house  So Opie can kick him in the liver  Oh  Oh  I really don't know what he's talking about  Chester  I have no idea what you're talking about 
[02:31:30]  Chester  Like I said, I have no idea what you're talking about  Chester, where are you, Chester?  Shut up  Chester  Shut up  Chester, where are you?  Shut up  Chester, why are you limping like that?  Why is Chester boy limping?  This never happens  As if someone kicked him in the liver  Shut up  Shut up  We agreed, we're not ready to tell that one yet  We're not ready 
[02:32:00]  Not ready?  It's been ten years  Shut up  It's been ten years  When will we be ready?  We're just not ready for that story  Chester  We're not ready for the Chester story  Chester boy  If I didn't know any better, Chester  I would swear somebody kicked you in the liver  You know what?  I'm going to save myself here  This will be the cliffhanger  This will be the cliffhanger  Shut up  Chester has liver cancer 
[02:32:30]  The vet is saying it was caused by something  No, that's not true  I believe it could have been a kick to the liver  But who in my house  Would kick my beautiful Chester in the liver?  Who?  It's going to be the cliffhanger  There are only a limited number of people that come into my apartment  I can count them on one hand  And I know none of them are mean enough to have kicked a little Chester in the liver 
[02:33:00]  You don't know what happened  I wasn't there  I don't know what happened  But based on  Shut up  We agreed  Chester  Shut up  Oh, Chester  Where are you, Chester?  Chester looks a little run down these days  Shut up  Chester's not as pranky as he used to be  This will be the cliffhanger  Maybe we'll finally tell the Chester story on Monday 
[02:33:30]  Chester  Chester  Chester  Where's my dog, Chester?  Chester  You don't look the same happy peppy pup as I remember from just yesterday  Is something bothering you, Chester?  Chester  Chester, why do you have a Nike print on your side? 
[02:34:00]  Shut up  You just saved me, because I've never worn Nikes  Oh, I made a mistake  That's not a Nike logo  I believe it's a Puma logo on your side  Actually, this is so odd  If I didn't know any better  I can swear that those are rollerblade prints on your side  I know one person that rollerblades 
[02:34:30]  No, no, no  Now, who do I know that rollerblades?  Hmm  Chester  Chester's having problems coming up the stairs  Hmm  Dude, he's making all this up, Ben  Don't look at me differently  I wonder if this has anything to do with broken stuff around my house  Shut up!  All the broken items that have just been sitting here for years and years and years 
[02:35:00]  It's my mother-in-law's, my ex-mother-in-law's dog, Chester  My mother-in-law  Opie lived with my mother-in-law for a while  Oh, just for a little while  A little while  Not too long  When we moved to Massachusetts  I was there a mere  To do our show at AAF  A mere couple years  I know  I moved in  It was me and my ex-wife living with my mother-in-law  I am so happy to have you kids living with me here in Ashland 
[02:35:30]  This is wonderful  And Opie's moving in also  And I was like, in a second, we gotta get out of here  Get an apartment, I don't care, we gotta get out  Opie wound up living there forever  Yeah  You were there for so long, like months and months and months  Just about a year  Yeah, it was about a year  He lived with my mother-in-law for a year  Do you still keep in touch with her?  No  Why would I?  It's my ex-mother-in-law  You might have developed a friendship  No, no  Nice enough woman  But why am I gonna, you know, keep in touch with her? 
[02:36:00]  You know  She gets to see  I send her daughter pictures of Benjamin Franklin  Lots of them  Every three months  So I don't think  I think that's as close of a relationship as we have  But Opie stayed there  And El Clutzo was constantly breaking stuff  She had little knick-knacks and trinkets all over the place  Dude  And Opie would be on the phone  And the phone cord is swinging  It's the last person in America that had a cord on her phone  I know  And it was like 50 to 60 feet long 
[02:36:30]  It was so long  So Opie would go out of the kitchen  No exaggeration  This cord was 50 to 60 feet  And I like to pace when I'm on the phone  Yeah  And it looked like a big tangled slinky  When it was a  When the phone was hung up  Because it was stretched out  And so  Right  So tangled  So Opie would be pulling this thing  And it's trailing this ball of coiled up phone wire  Right  That's swinging just like a wrecking ball  It was almost like a tail  Like a dog's tail  Why are my Christmas hummels all broken?  I've had these for years and years and years 
[02:37:00]  I take perfect care of them  I don't understand  I know Chester doesn't jump up where he would break them  Why is Chester limping?  Why?  Dude  Chester was fine yesterday  I have no idea, right?  And now Chester  I really have no idea  Stop  That's what Chester would do  All the time  Maybe if the dog didn't eat my prime rib dinner 
[02:37:30]  Oh, the devil  Oh, jeez  It's devilish  What?  What happened?  The power of Christ  Compels you  The power of Christ compels you  Must get this  Cast this demon out  Anyway  That's a story for another time, Anthony  I think I have to find out right now  What happened to my little boy Chester  He's since passed away  And his ashes are in an urn 
[02:38:00]  In my living room  But I don't understand  He seemed fine  And then all of a sudden  Out of the clear blue  He all of a sudden  Developed a limp  And he couldn't get up the stairs  And Anthony had to come over  And carry Chester  Up the fucking stairs  Oh, every day  Thanks  The dog was old  Real old  The dog was old  It was real old  And because he was old 
[02:38:30]  I'm sure he didn't need any  No, the dog was arthritic  Obviously  He didn't  He needed no sudden shocks  To his little old body  Like maybe a fall  Because he's old  Perhaps if something was  What did I do to you today?  Or perhaps  What did I do to you today?  He doesn't need to be hit by a car  Or walk out  Or have the paper boy  Throw something and hit him  Or perhaps being kicked in the side  All right  What kind of dog was Chester? 
[02:39:00]  A lovable mutt  Just a lovable mutt  I had him since he was a little puppy  Now he's gone  My Chester  Do you realize who you hired?  He's a disruptive influence  Anthony  He happens to be a dwarf  What horrible people  Our new bosses said  You guys should get as crazy as you want  They keep creating new ways  To celebrate mediocrity  Opie and Anthony show  It's psychotic  XM's 100% commercial free music channels

[02:47:00]  I'm not leaving the studio  He's coming back in  Oh man  Is he pissed  You fucking guys  I've been through a five year litigation  You think I wanna get on the fucking air with this asshole?  Now I'm pissed  Hey  Guys  It was Anthony's  No, radio's radio  Hey, I didn't say anything  I went through a five year litigation  It was Anthony's fault  Look  Look  Look  It was Anthony's fault  Hey, what are you pointing at me? 
[02:47:30]  I didn't do shit  It was five years  It was Anthony's fault, right?  Five years  They took everything  I can't believe Anthony  Now I'm gonna get some pendejo on the phone  That's gonna say that he wants to challenge me  What?  Whose idea was it to make believe we were off the air?  Anthony's right?  What do you tell me?  Rewind the tape  Opie's on the ground  No, no, no  That is stupid  Yeah, that was really stupid Anthony  When Master Poe asked  Are we off the air?  Who's the one that said  Yes, we're off the air?  Uh, that was you  Bullshit  It was Opie  Jim  Who was the one that said  Hey, how long until we're back on the air? 
[02:48:00]  Three minutes  That is not why I'm here  Clever ruse, Opie  That is not why I'm here  Right  Okay  My skills  Does that pertain to school?  Get on the mic  Because we're on the radio now  Oh, we are?  Yeah  This is fun  Oh, boy  Hello  Oh, my God  No, no, no  We're on the air  You're talking to us  Okay, yeah  Okay, now  What?  No, the guy ain't on the air  You guys piss me off, man  I'm telling you  I know  Five years of litigation  The worst combat in my life  Oh, boy 
[02:48:30]  The worst  What happened?  You can't just reach over  Are you allowed to tell what happened?  First insurance  Well, no  First  All right, wait, wait  Hold on  But what happened?  I'll tell you  1999  I was hit with Hurricane Floyd  Three years of litigation with that  And now  It has nothing to do with fighting somebody  Oh, wait, wait, wait a second  We're talking about litigation  We're talking about legalities here  Is he trying to say he tried to fight a hurricane?  Is he smiling?  No, I'm not  No, it's not a smile  It's more of a growl  Okay  And then 
[02:49:00]  All right, Hurricane Floyd  And then after that  And then my divorce  Stop whining  Any man that's out there  Stop whining  Okay  Look, my hands are above the table  Look  Guys  I don't  I don't push those buttons  Guys  I don't push those buttons  You brought me into this  Look  I'm going to explain  And that is not  Why I'm here  I  I'm not here  I handle the phone calls  Anthony does the sound bites  Right, Anthony?  I'm not doing anything  Well, technically the guy  You really didn't do anything  Because the guy just called  And asked for it  Yeah, that's all  You said no 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, you actually said no  I didn't say anything  I didn't even talk to the guy  But you fought a hurricane  And you got divorced  That has nothing to do with  Beating up somebody  For the radio show  Litigation  But this guy's saying  He could kick your ass  Well  And I had no confidence  To say that  Master Paul  I'm not here  That's not why I'm here  You want to put him on the phone?  You want to put him on the radio?  No, not at the litigation thing  What's with the litigation?  Yeah, what's with the litigation?  Five years of going through court  Yeah  Dealing with  Oh  Is that it? 
[02:50:00]  You're setting me up  Wait a minute  I have nothing to do with that  Oh, baby  I have nothing to do with that  This is going to be fun  Somebody's going to attack  Are you insane?  Somebody's going to attack  And I'm going to duck  And it's going to hit you  And yeah  Pow  Are you insane, Anthony?  I'm not doing anything  Let Master Paul tell his little story  No, I'm not going to say nothing  Holy crap  You got me pissed off  I don't get anything  What's up with the litigation?  Nothing  Huh?  You're going to hit the laughter button  I don't have laughter buttons  Oh, don't lie

I just told you  Did you fight somebody?  Oh, yeah  Alright, and what happened?  The worst combat of my life 
[02:51:00]  In what way?  Divorce  Oh, that  Oh  Oh, you see  Now we are  Lost everything  We are brothers at combat  What do you mean  You lost everything?  I lost everything  I lost my home  I lost my business  I lost my cars  I mean  What else?  Oh  More laughter  Oh, my God  This is great  I'm getting excited  And today  Oh, my God  Oh, my God  Oh, my God  Is he looking at us? 
[02:51:30]  I don't know  All I know is  There's no way  I'm getting my teeth kicked in  Because there's no buttons  In front of me  He's not looking at us, right?  Mmm  Alright  So what happened?  Nothing  Nothing  Oh, Jesus Christ  We're in trouble  Not a thing  Alright  I'm gonna  Why don't we go to a break?  Because I have to tinkle  Can someone open that door?  I think I can make it  Oh, you think you can make it past them?  I think so  I think you'd be clotheslined  In a second  You wanna have a push-up contest? 
[02:52:00]  Sure  Alright  So was it a bad divorce?  Is that your phone thing ringing?  Is that noise?  No, I don't know what that is  In my headphone?  It's not mine, though  Alright  Uh  Yeah  Look  I have nothing  Look  My hands are up in the air  That's nice  You know it's Norton, right?  Good place for it  You know it's Norton? 
[02:52:30]  He cues things with his feet  It's just a matter of time  Before it becomes  The Master Poe Show  You know that, right?  Oh, jeez  He can take over this place  Anytime he wants  Alright, well  See, this is what I'm doing  I'm gonna play some Richard Cheese  He's a really good friend of ours  And he's coming in soon  I'm actually shaking  Richard Cheese  Yeah  So are you better now  From the divorce?  Now that it's over?  I want you to know  That I don't curse  I'm just asking 
[02:53:00]  I haven't cursed in years  Oh my god  No, you cursed when he came in here  I said  We're just getting to know each other  I said  I haven't cursed in years  We're just getting to know each other  He can tell you that  You lack discipline  I had nothing to do with that  And that didn't make sense anyway  Yeah  Yes it did  There's plenty of discipline  Yeah  It completely made sense  That you did that  I didn't do that one  I mean  You know Stephen King 
[02:53:30]  Came out with 50 quotes  He did  50 of his all-time favorite movie quotes  Oh  Well, we're gonna take a break  Alright  We're gonna go through a couple of those  Poe, is there anything else you want to say?  No, because you're gonna say  We're taking a break  And we're not taking anything  Oh no, we're gonna take a break  Oh, that old clever ruse of Opie's  Uh-huh  Hmm  I agree with you  That was underhanded  Jerry  Do you know the human head weighs 8 pounds?  That was Jonathan Lipnick  And Jerry Maguire  Oh  Yeah 
[02:54:00]  That's kind of funny, right?  Number 49  No, not necessarily the funniest  But the best movie quotes  Isn't it something that's funny?  Lipnicky?  Something that's funny?  Yeah  Let's go to Chris  Chris on the phones  Uh, Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys  Love you, Jim  Hi, Chris  The contest is over  Opie just won the MiFi  Too bad he's not gonna live long enough to use it  That's funny  Watch it out, guys  Hold on  You don't really think it was all me, right?  No, no  Nobody thinks it was all you, buddy  No, not you  I'm talking to the guy that looks like he wants to kill me 
[02:54:30]  You know it wasn't all me, right?  We're gonna find out if a MiFi works up the human rectum  It'd be an interesting little experiment  So, uh  Hmm  I'm not bad  I'm just drawn that way  That was Jessica Rabbit  In Who Framed Roger Rabbit?  Oh, what number did that come in?  Number 40, Ant  Number 40  Let's say hi to Jeff in Arkansas  Jeff?  Come on, Marshmallow Man  Run past him  Go ahead  I'm sizing up the room, trust me 
[02:55:00]  There's only one way out  That's the problem  Marshmallow Man  Why don't you put Steve's boots on?  Oh, you could run faster if your boots are on fire  Yeah  Yeah, yeah  Alright, thank you  You're welcome  Bye  Wait, what's going on?  Steve's seeing a clothes by Hibachi  What?  Pass me in the garbage can  Why?  Why, where are you gonna hit with it?  No, he's gonna put them in the garbage can  Now I'm gonna protect myself  Oh, alright  You want me to try to get over the counter?  Opie was just so fearful 
[02:55:30]  Full right there  No kidding, dude  You were just like  Uh-oh, what am I gonna have to do?  Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?  Oh, Airplane  Airplane  That was Peter Graves  That was number 31  31?  What are you doing, every 10?  Oh, I don't know  I'm just skipping around  Just waiting to see  Which one of you two is assaulted first  I have nipples, Greg  Could you milk me?  That would be  Meet the parents  The nipples  They feel like kind of  Tinkering 
[02:56:00]  Nipples are very sensitive  Hmm  What was that from?  Uh, I believe it was, um  The one where Arnold was, uh  Pregnant  Oh, she's daddy's little girl  That's funny  It's not a tumor  It's just a lump on the side of my head  Junior, that was the movie  Junior  Yes, I'm in the movie  Junior  Junior  So, um  How are we going to solve this, Master Poe?  Jenny  Huh? 
[02:56:30]  You know Anthony had a lot to do with it, right?  No!  You know Anthony's the instigator on this radio show  Why is he?  He's the puppet master  The puppet master  Yeah, I'm quite a puppet master  Hmm  Well  When's Tom Cheese coming in?  Richard Cheese  Yeah  Richard Cheese  Oh yeah, Tom and Cheese is a comedian  I knew you were there  Uh, Richard Cheese is coming in soon  Do you know a comic named Tom?  Tom and Cheese, yeah  He has a new, uh, CD out called 
[02:57:00]  Toxicity  And we're going to play, uh  Baby Got Back  His version  Why is he walking around the counter?  What are you going to do to me?  I think you really  You  That's right  I think you owe Master Poe an apology  I think so  For your little, you know  What about you?  I didn't do the off the air bit  See guys, I'm not here for sport  Yeah  I'm here in case someone wants to kill you 
[02:57:30]  But not  Not wants to submit you  But no it sucks  If they want to come in with a knife  And take it and thrust it into your stomach  Uh oh  That is my prevention  I am your buffer  I'm the protector  Right  I'm your guide  I'm your king  I'm the one that will protect you  And take one if I have to  But now the protector wants to kill us  How stupid are we?  Doesn't that always happen?  The Roman army comes back and  He's our bodyguard  He's our Kevin Costner  And I'm certainly Whitney Houston in this situation 
[02:58:00]  I would have said you're Adam Baldwin  I thought he was a more effective bodyguard  If you remember the original film  Hmm  Not Alec, Adam  Adam  Okay  I was thinking Linderman  That's who I meant  Adam Baldwin  That was his real name  Was it?  Adam Baldwin, yes  An opiate Chris Makepeace  Well I guess  And a friend with the awful sign is his  Linderman  Well I guess we learned a lesson here today  Isn't Matt Dillon in that?  Yes  And that would be  Steve can be Moody  Moody 
[02:58:30]  And Ben can be the Ruth Gordon character  The grandmother  You're among friends Ricky  His little slasherists  Come on  Hobson  Wow  You have seen that a few times  My father took me to see that in the movie theater  Oh  He took me to a Woody Allen film  I went to punch him in a ball  Because I was too young to get it  So uh  Oh  Still trying to take a break  But I don't know how we do this  Uh I don't know 
[02:59:00]  You put the thing in  And we all go pee  There you go  Am I allowed to go pee?  I don't know  Can you?  Another ten minutes  I'm going to pee in my pants  Who is your daddy  And what does he do?  Let's see how long you can last  Oh boy  Alright  Um  Oh boy  Tim in D.C.  Tim what's up?  Hey how's it going?  Good what's up?  Hey pose is fake  What do you mean pose is fake?  Why is that?  Why is that?  Because whenever you first mention 
[02:59:30]  Putting him in a ring with somebody  He comes up with this BS litigation  And then he comes up  As though he actually kicked somebody's ass  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  And uh  Excuse me  And then he comes up with this BS  As though he was in five years of litigation  Had nothing to do with actually fighting  The guy  I guarantee he's not proven in any ring  And he just  He's an actor  Pretty uh  Pretty strong words  From D.C.  Yeah it's pretty easy  To shit talk from Virginia 
[03:00:00]  Well let's ask  Or Maryland actually  Well why don't you uh  Say that to Poe  Or Poe  What do you think of that?  Anyone that gets in the ring  It's for sport  Uh  What is your name again?  Oh  Oh  He just ran  What is your name?  Tim  Hey Tim how you doing?  I'm doing alright  Um  So  What you're saying is that  Because I don't get in the ring  And uh  No  That's not what I'm saying  What I'm saying is  Why did you make up the story 
[03:00:30]  About being in litigation  And make it appear  Tim I don't think he made anything up  Yeah I don't think  You're just trying to stir things up  Aren't you?  Yes  Yes you are  Jesus Tim  You could have  Listen it's an observation of truth  It's not masked behind some  I'm a badass bodyguard  Oh hang up on him  I've had it  I don't like him stirring things up  While we're sitting in here  Exactly  In the cage  I don't like him kicking the hornet's nest  While we're sitting in it  Exactly 
[03:01:00]  Uh  A lot of people wondering if  Opie is sitting down to pee right now  As he's in the bathroom  Ha ha  Alright we'll uh  We'll take our little break  And then  We'll be back  After Opie urinates  Opie and Anthony  XM202  And we're back  With the Opie and Anthony show  I'm still shaking  No joke  I gotta smooth things over 
[03:01:30]  With our protector  The instant feedback went nuts  Anthony  Um  Hey Opie  Distract him with the flying poker chips  Lots of balls now  Huh  He will break you like you did  To stalker Patty's frame  Al from Whackbag.com  You need to hire somebody  To protect you  From your protection  Yes  Uh  Let's see  Uh  Yeah I hope you're gonna pee  But you're gonna have to sit down  And do it  Uh  Uh  Let's see  Poe is gonna reach through the phone  And choke this genius  Jason from Delaware 
[03:02:00]  Uh  Will XM be able to figure out  How to  Live broadcast  From two funerals  Uh  Angel from Jersey  Master Poe  Relax dude  Master Poe  If One and  And Jimmy  Love you  They will  Include you in the show  It's the nature of the show  Just chill out  Don't kill them please  I've waited two effing years  For my dudes to get back on the air  It just goes on and on Anthony  I'm not uh  I'm not afraid  Because I  Opie  Am  A level 18 sorcerer  On EverQuest 2 
[03:02:30]  So you know how to handle this situation  Oh I could  I could stun him with my freeze spell  Yeah  And make quick my getaway  Yeah that'll work  Maybe I could uh  I could use the uh  The shackles on him  And freeze him in place  As I run for the zone line  Sure  Patrick from Brooklyn  When I went down to the studio  Poe scared the shit out of me  And my friends  And Old Dirty was mentally altered by Poe  Is the real deal  Well you know what else you can do  Like what a lot of EverQuest guys do  When there's real controversy  The old trick of kneeling 
[03:03:00]  And taking the zipper down with the teeth  And going  I haven't seen that in my uh  Offense book or anything  My spell book doesn't have  You throw a flaming mouth  At the man's genitals  Oh look it's hitting for a lot of damage  Henchman  My dignity level is going down  Henchman from Brooklyn  Hey guys I heard music soothes the savage beast  Maybe a little more Richard Cheese  Will help the situation  You know I think we should clear the phone lines 
[03:03:30]  I don't need to get in any more trouble  You notice how quiet Steve was during that little thing  He didn't his little Lebanese temper didn't flare at all  Oh yeah  And uh  Johnny Baby from Canada  Did you read that one?  No  Five years of litigation  Worst fight of my life  Nothing works here  I hate this place  Shut up  It's really tough to do a show  When you've got adrenaline flowing through your body  Oh  How long does it take to calm down?  About 20 minutes maybe?  You're really like uh 
[03:04:00]  Oh dude man  Look at my hand  You see the look he was giving us?  Yeah I know  Yeah I know but  He's you know  He's  He's a paid employee  I think he knows  His boundaries  And you know  What his job is  You know there are some times  We come in here  And perhaps we've had a disagreement  With somebody else in the uh  In the office  We don't go to throwing  Fisticuffs Opie  We deal with it  Maybe a little time passes  And everything's fine  Pose a professional  Well disciplined 
[03:04:30]  Professional  I hope he's listening to all this  Here's what you're missing though  You guys deal with it  The way you deal with it  Which is on the air  And well  So when there's a problem in the office  You deal with it on the air  The way he deals with problems  Is he removes a limb  Yeah  So his way of dealing with it  May just be his natural thing  Of pulling off a  A freckled blonde arm  And beating Opie to death with it  He would probably beat Ben so hard  Ben's hair would just straighten out  Look nice and neatly combed  Impossible  He'd hit Steve so hard 
[03:05:00]  His little boots would ice up  Hat would go out  All the time you'd just see smoke  I saw  I noticed Steve was awfully quiet  During that whole thing  That's what I was saying  He was saying  It was amazing  I don't want him to throw water  On my boots  Actually Steve  For many years  Steve was our defender  He was our protection  Steve was our protection  Did you see how quickly  Steve handed Poe the garbage can  Without knowing what Poe  Was going to do with it  Here's the trash can  Steve just handed a weapon 
[03:05:30]  Over to him  I thought I was going to be  Completely humiliated  And there was going to be  Nothing I could do about it  Oh I thought he was  Putting that trash can  Over your head  So did I  And how do you survive that  Yeah  How do you come back from that  There's no dignity  How do you go out in public  You have to sit there  And just pretend you're meant  To be like the  I can't think of that  Fucking thing's name  Bob cunt square pants  Oh sponge bob  Sponge bob square pants  You know  You could take the garbage pail  Off of you  But your dignity  Is in there with the trash  Never to come out again 
[03:06:00]  And then there's like  Milk and whatever else  We've thrown in the garbage pail  Since 6 this morning  Just kind of  Falling from my hair  Sam  Yeah man  Hey Opie  That's not adrenaline  That's fucking pussy juice  Yeah  Yeah  I can't argue with you today man  Dan from Wisconsin  What's up Dan  Love this time of year  Watching the Yule Steve  When someone gives you  A guard dog  To protect you  And stuff  It's okay  To yank his chain  Every now and then  But you don't 
[03:06:30]  Piss him off  And pull his tail  I mean  He'll turn around  And bite your hand  Clean off  I want to make this  Perfectly clear  That I'm not the only one  That was involved  In this thing  Hey  All of you were  Poking him with sticks  Not me  Everyone had a sharp stick  Not Jimmy  I didn't do any poking  And not me  I learned a valuable lesson today  Yeah  You all were giving him  A gouge every now and then  Alright Dan  Thank you  You be careful now  Alright  Tony in the Bronx  Hey Tony  What's going on 
[03:07:00]  Why don't you  Strap on your scuba gear  And fight up  I'm not the poor  Underwater  Take it a few feet  Underwater  I wonder if he could  Fight as well as I can  Underwater  Yep  He kicked your ass  Underwater  60 feet underwater  I would never even  Fight as good as you can  You had one fight  Underwater  With a Frenchman  Well how many fights  Have you had  Underwater  None  Jim how many fights  Have you had  Underwater  I've had  About four  I could be the only man 
[03:07:30]  Alive that has ever  Fought 60 feet  Underwater  Battling your hog  In the bathtub  Doesn't count  I gotcha  Come here  Trying to get it  Out of the ducky  Before all the water  Drains  Alright well  Don't mock it  Unless you've  Won fight  Unless you've tried it  60 feet underwater  With a French guy  Yeah  What kind of fight  Is a French guy  Going to put up  Not a good one  But slow motion  Fighting rules  It really does  Dave in Indianapolis 
[03:08:00]  What's up Dave  I was just wondering  Isn't there anything  In that 30 minutes  Of paperwork  That the guests fill out  That would protect  Master Poe  From a lawsuit  Oh I see  You know what  That started out  As just a fun little thing  You know  This guy wants to  Fight Master Poe  For a MiFi  We actually weren't  Going to have  Master Poe  Fight anybody  No we just want  To hear the guy  We want to hear  The caller  The guy that  Offered to fight  We want to hear him  Talk some smack  That's all  That's it  And then 
[03:08:30]  Turn it into a big thing  Because Anthony  Decided to make believe  We were still on the air  It just amazes me  Listen to the replay  Yourself  You'll hear it  Yep  Listen to the replay  You will hear Opie  Say no  We're off the air  And then you'll see  Too bad you can't see  Anthony lean back  In mock  Casual relaxing thing  To make him lower his guard  Yeah I forgot about that  How you were all  Lean back  Shut up  That was your after show posture  I was stretching  Yeah leaning back  But being able to reach forward  Just enough to hit a couple  Of those buttons  In front of you  Oh thank you for the 
[03:09:00]  Hanging out to dry  What about Opie  How long before we go to break  Two minutes  We got two minutes  Before we go to the break  Am I acting  Or come back from break  Stinks too  Worked well enough  Yeah alright  So  Oh  Oh  The leaning back thing  Stop it  Yeah you really were  All your hands behind your head  Just to disarm him  You totally sold me out  Right there  I didn't hear Jimmy Norton go  No we're on the air still  Master Poe  Jimmy Norton's a good actor  He took his headphones off  Like he was on break 
[03:09:30]  Oh you took your headphones off  I believed it  I thought we were on a break  You did not  Stop it  Alright I'm gonna make it  Perfectly clear  That Anthony  Oh you wanna make this perfect  That Anthony wants to talk to Brian  Not me  Let's just hear what Brian has to say  Well why don't you say hi to Brian  Hello Brian  Yo  Hi  Are you actually the guy  That wrote in and wanted to  Fight Master Poe  Yes I am  Ah  Yes I am  I can give you my email address  And everything  Thanks for starting a little bit  Of crap on the show  What the hell happened 
[03:10:00]  Cause I  Infighting  I just gotta  I gotta  Well what happened was  That I was  I was almost paralyzed  And Anthony was almost  Thrown through a window  And  And would have fell  Probably six to seven stories  To his death  Thanks to you  My bad  Well  And Norton would have  Just skated out of here  Yep  I'd like to  I'd like to know  What  Where's Brian's from  Connecticut  He's from Connecticut  And what are your  What are your fighting qualifications  Sir  Qualifications  Well  I've done a little  MMA here and there 
[03:10:30]  Mixed martial arts  For those who don't know  MMA  Yes  Mixed martial arts  Yes  And  Probably not as much  As Poe  But like  I just want to prove  That I could probably  Hang in there with him  For a few minutes  Win the Wi-Fi  And  All kidding aside  There's no way  You can hang in there  With Master Poe  We've seen the guy  In action  Yeah  Look at me  Kissing Master Poe's ass  Now  But it's the truth  Are you a big guy  Or are you like  A wiry guy  That can kick some ass  No  About 6'1  2'10  We've seen  Master Poe  Spar  And it's pretty ugly 
[03:11:00]  I'd spar one of many times  Yeah  I don't know  If we can get this done  We can't  Only because  If he hurts you  And he probably will  Yeah  That's what he's talking about  With lawsuits  He'll get sued  Because he's here to protect  And all of a sudden  You know  We have him  Ripping people's arms out  And smashing them with us  I usually end up  Hurting someone  Real bad  Yeah  Well hey  You know what  If I had to sign a waiver  I'll sign a waiver  Whatever  Alright  Yellow belly  Harvey  Alright well  Harvey  It's a thought  We'll see what happens with that  We got your info  Alright  Alright dude  Alright

[03:17:00]  Cool  Hold on  I gotta see the book  Alright no I don't  We're trying to get her  On the phone right now  Alright  This is a little  Like a one sheet  On the  The best  You'll ever have  What every woman  Should know  About getting  And giving  Knock your socks  To have sex  By Shannon Mullen  Here you go  This is the picture  And I do believe  We have her on the line  It's Shannon Mullen  Right Shannon  Yep  Welcome to the  Opie and Anthony program  Welcome to the program  Hi  Thanks for having me on  Oh no problem  When we found out  That we were going  To have you on the show 
[03:17:30]  We got quite excited  Oh yeah  We really did  We love sex  LOL  Who doesn't  Is right you know  So what's going on  There Shannon  Not much  The book is called  The best you'll ever have  Yep  With a very very long  Subtitle  Well yes  Can I ask you a question  Yeah  Hi this is Connor  The  It's  Myth number one  You have a section here  On sexual myths  Uh huh  What is this about 
[03:18:00]  Tush sex is for gay men  Oh  Yeah that's  That's a big myth  Oh I think you were saying  Oh that's a myth  Hold on  Yeah that's a myth  I thought you were saying  That it was  I thought you were saying  That it was  That it was actually  Only for gay men  No no  That would be part  Of the myth list  Oh so that's something  That is a  Knock your socks off  Type of sex  Yeah that's actually  Something that  I think people  Thought I'd talk about  More  For women they think  Well why would I want  Something up my butt  When I have a perfectly 
[03:18:30]  Good vagina  Right exactly  Especially if you're  Going to hit logs  Yeah so you have to  Kind of think it through  And think why that  Makes sense in order  To convince yourself  To give it a go  And why does that  Make sense  Now why does it  Make sense there  It makes sense for women  Because there's a muscle  Called the PC muscle  That goes from your  Pupic bone to your  Tailbone  Like a hammock  And all of that  Muscle is filled  With nerve endings  Every human being  Who has an orgasm  Has their butt twitch  You know 
[03:19:00]  It's all connected  Anthony and I  Have this thing though  We think butt sex  Should be left  For the young  How old is too old  To have butt sex  Right  For the young only  You're a bit saucy  Little  You're a bit saucy  For our program  But that's okay  There's actually a good  Line here too  This is pretty funny  It's about the G spot  And it says here  The search party  Hold on  What page is this  It says 
[03:19:30]  Break out the rubber gloves  Kidding  About looking for the G spot  Now  Hold on  This is page 51  Yeah  Is that a problem  That most men have  Finding the G spot  That's a problem  Most women have too  So where is this  Really  So where is this G spot  Yeah  I'll tell you  Because I finally came up  With a way to explain it  That I think is pretty simple  There's a picture in the book  That you can't misunderstand  What page  What page  Yeah what  There's two pictures in a row  Let me just flip through  Oh hold on  I got it right here 
[03:20:00]  There's one with a finger  With a finger  I have page 49  It's a diagram of the G spot  Is that it  That's right  49 and 53  Oh two pages  Hold on  You look at 49  Then you look at  Let me get 49  Hold on  Alright  So we show it first  Like in relationship  To what everyone knows  Everyone knows  The uterus and the ovaries  Right  Because we had that in school  So if you're going to  Explain anything  You have to show that  Uh huh  It says here the G spot  It also has a picture 
[03:20:30]  Of the bladder  Yes  Exactly  The bladder  Because at least  We still have the bladder  In our heads  Not much  Right  And for women  The only thing  They really remember  Is the tampon diagram  True that  Oh yeah  Every box of tampons  Comes with one of those  Who doesn't know that  But that diagram sucks  So how do you find the G spot  You shove a couple fingers  In there  And then what do you do  Well I would start  With just one  Just one  I'm going to shock  That's true  You don't need to lose  Your babysitting job  Right away  You can reserve  The rest of the hand  For other activities 
[03:21:00]  Right right  So through that  The motion  Is the come hither motion  Yeah  Come over here  Yeah  So when you're doing that  Stop halfway through  And take a look  At your hand from the side  And you'll see  You're in like  A perfect C shape  Uh yeah  A perfect C shape  It's like two and a half  Inches in toward  The belly button  Right  It's toward the  Belly button side  And it's  It's very  Like you said  Like two and a half  Inches  It's the bottom  One third  So it's not  Very far in  And if you press  On the pubic bone  Which is really  The base of your  Jeans zipper 
[03:21:30]  Everyone has a pubic  Yes we do  But behind the pubic bone  For women  Is the G spot  So you try to get  Behind that bone  It's quite spongy  Right  It is  It's like a  Ridgy spongy  It's erectile tissue  So if she's in  The right frame of mind  The G spot's there  And you can feel it  And if she's not  In the right frame of mind  If she's nervous  Or uptight  And just not ready yet  Right  It won't really  Be very prominent  And the main thing  For women is  They've felt it  Here and there  But it makes them 
[03:22:00]  Nervous  Because it makes them  Feel like they're  Going to pee  Oh really  So a lot of times  They'll feel it  And they'll seize up  And stop everything  Instead of knowing  They're not going to pee  Being able to relax  So we're going to lose  The best orgasm  It's the fear of pain  I like to call that  G spot  Connor's headrest  Yeah  Headrest  Yeah our old  Connor here in the studio  I know  I always  I'm afraid to go swimming  Though  I am  I  The book here  Now are you actually  Is it released yet  Yeah it just came out  Oh 
[03:22:30]  Time for Christmas  Where can you get it  Barnes and Noble  Amazon  I think your local  Bookstores carry it  Yeah  Um  Hold on  There's  Twitch talk  There's actually  I'll say one thing  I like the  There's a tremendous  Amount of like little  Headings at the top  Of every  Every page  So it's kind of like  Almost like a  Food for thought  Type of book  Oh  Like you know what I mean  Like you want to go out  And go fishing or something  With your mom  And you know 
[03:23:00]  If you're going to go fishing  And maybe only one  Comes back  And two don't  Right  How about here  It says don't hate  Masturbate  Oh  That's a pretty good story  I got  What's that about  Well I started this business  Called Safina  Right  About two years ago  And um  Safina is these  In-home  Sex ed salons  And we sell  Sex toys  Oh  Oh  We call them  Sexories  Accessories  Accessories  Like accessories  But only  But only  Sex 
[03:23:30]  Right  I get it  Right  Accessories for your less life  I mean the whole thing  About sex in America  Is still  It's very awkward  And uncomfortable  Like tush talk  I mean the reason  We call it that  Is so you can actually  Talk about your butt  Without feeling like  A weird person  Without feeling dirty  Well no one wants  To listen to their tush  Plus it's breath stinks  Ha ha ha  Yeah  Ha ha ha  All right  Oh  All right  Well what else  Do you cover that  Could help us out  In the bedroom  Well  Sex toys 
[03:24:00]  Are something  That almost every woman  Is interested in  But they need  Permission to like them  So if you're married  Or you're in a  Long term relationship  You really should  Get some  But make sure  They're attractive  Don't buy ugly things  Sharon  What's the difference  Between a clit  And a penis  Oh that's a good question  What page is that  I'm sorry to interrupt you  Sharon  What page is that  Let's see  That's in the second chapter  Connor wants to follow along  In his own book  Yes  Like he followed along 
[03:24:30]  His mom  To those depths  That's good  It starts off  Explaining kind of  Where the clitoris is  And what is it  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Let me just  We're looking for the diagram  There's a great diagram  Of the difference  Between a clitoris  And a penis  Oh  What page  I'm sorry  I didn't mean to interrupt  What page  I'm trying to follow along  The book here  Okay here's a good page  I gotta take the  94  Hold on  The cover keeps falling off  Hold on  All right  94  We're at page 94  Here  All right  You'll be surprised 
[03:25:00]  At how similar  The clitoris and the penis are  Really  In fact  They're almost exactly the same  Well if they're on  Jamie Lee Curtis  They are  Yeah  Even on  Your most average woman  Well Susan  Obviously there's a  Difference in size though  I don't have a page  There is a big difference in size  But they operate  Exactly the same way  You know  Everyone starts off female  This I thought  Was very surprising  When I started this research  At the seventh week  If you've got a Y chromosome  Your vulva closes up  And it becomes testicles 
[03:25:30]  And the clitoris grows  Oh  So everyone starts off the same  So we actually have all  The same exact stuff  And the clitoris  Operates exactly the same  As the penis  So when blood rushes  To the region  Yes  The clitoris raises up  And gets erect  And sticks out  From its foreskin  How did you learn all this?  This took me about  A year and a half  That's it?  Well that's all I did  I interviewed doctors  Urologists  Dominatrixes 
[03:26:00]  You know people who know things  Really?  Let me ask you a question  Right here I'm looking at page 150  It says  I've never had  An orgasm  Yeah  These are stories of real women  Why are you laughing at that?  Some girls don't have an orgasm  I don't believe it  A lot of people  Yeah exactly  A lot  I would say  No less than 10%  My dad and mom  Would always fight  And she would always  My mom and I  Were talking one time  I actually just heard the fight  From inside the little  Room I was staying in  That she would never  Have orgasms  Right  I mean I heard this 
[03:26:30]  It was kind of embarrassing  As a kid to hear that  But it's like  I think times have changed now  Where I think men are more  In tune with making  A woman have an orgasm  Am I right or wrong?  See Connor's very interested  In your book  And learning all he can  I mean I just know  He's soaking up  Every bit of information  He can and just  Tearing through it  Yeah  That's good  That means he's actually  Interested in women  That's good  Oh yeah  Oh I am  I'm very attached to my mother  You know  Because this orgasm thing  Is not a small problem  I mean when I say 10%  I think I'm being conservative  So  Wow 
[03:27:00]  Wow  Safina  So Safina  What kind of advice  Could you give to the ladies  That don't get the orgasms there?  Yeah  Orgasms really do  Start in mind  Uh huh  What's that?  I couldn't hear  It's very very important  Just relax  Just relax  And that's  Come on  Most of the time  If you haven't had an orgasm  By the time you're in your 20s  You're pretty frustrated  Can't you just get them really  Calm all  Can't you get them  Just really drunk  Will that help?  Oh what about alcohol?  It really can't hurt  I mean  As long as you're not doing anything 
[03:27:30]  Related to the butt  I mean  Let me ask you  You should never be drunk or high  That's a really bad idea  Never be drunk or high  For the butt  That's the only way I can take it  Is  Is  Tush sex  Bad for you?  Like for instance  I used to do one girl  That's another myth  Shut up  Yeah  Because people think  Wow  You know  That doesn't seem like  It ought to happen  Because in our culture  It seems so bad  Yeah  And they think  Wow  What if I get  All stretched out of shape  And I'm in pain  Yeah  Right  But if it's done properly  With lots of lube  And going very slowly  Right  Yeah 
[03:28:00]  It's just another muscle  You're exercising  But if she's crying  And saying no  Yeah  Then you probably better quit  Right then  Really?  Should you stop  Or should you put the diaper  Back on  Absolutely  I know  He's being silly  Yeah  Oh Connor  I'm  Sarah  Sarah  No Shannon  Oh Shannon  Oh B  Oh I'm sorry  That's okay  I've been calling you  And who was the mistress  Let's see 
[03:28:30]  The male G spot  Equals the P spot  Yeah  P dash  P dash  Spot  What does that mean?  The P spot  Is pretty interesting  Because like I was saying  The clitoris and the penis  Are the same  Well men have a G spot too  Of course  Because we have all the same stuff  Yeah  It just moves around  So you know  Where the G spot  Is right behind the pubic bone  And you make this  Come hither motion  The P spot  Is just a little further back  And it's on the back side  Of the prostate  So you're saying 
[03:29:00]  That men and women  Are pretty much the same  Before we're born  But it's just some type  Of a chromosome  Yeah  All right  And so everything  Just shifts around  But what makes women  A little bit smarter  Than we are?  Oh Connor  They sure are  They  They sure are  We know who the boss  At home is  Unless you have a motor  And a boat  Then we teach you  Wow  Yeah one little blonde hair  In the front seat  Dad didn't think  Okay 
[03:29:30]  I do have a theory  About happiness  I'd love to try out on you  Oh  Oh  Well hold on  A little experiment  Just if you agree  Well hold on  Okay  Here's my theory  All right  The reason why I focus  On women with Safina  And getting them  To buy sex toys  Is because I think  That if women  Think something's  A good idea  And so  Then we can all do it  Yeah  So that if you're  Having fun  If women are having fun  Then we can all have fun  Right  So my theory is  That women are in control  Of the fun 
[03:30:00]  And that women  Can still have fun  Yeah  What do you think  I have to agree with you  I think you're right  Yeah  Yeah  You seem to have  Culled a lot of knowledge  From a lot of people  And put it together  Very nicely in this book  Well thanks  What have you learned  On your own  Through your own  Sexual experiences  Wow  A lot  I think I've learned a lot  Well I found  The kazoo 
[03:30:30]  Is really distracting  What's that?  The kazoo  Is really distracting  Shoes are distracting?  Is that the kazoo?  Kazoo  What are you talking about?  Something must be  Bleeding through  I don't know  What you're talking about  Oh okay  I was hearing  Christmas music  We were having  Christmas music  No  Actually we  We don't play  Christmas music  On our show  Ever  Yeah because we figure  All the other radio stations  Are doing that  So I don't know  Okay that's good  Okay  I don't know  I don't know  What that was  We had some  Equipment problems earlier  And we do apologize  For that  Oh that's okay 
[03:31:00]  Shannon  If something was  Bleeding through  From our production facility  I'm going to  Speak this up  Your ass  But I pooped  From there  I found my  G spot  And I lost it  And I found it again  You did?  Yeah I lost it  For like seven years  Wow  Where'd you lose it?  You lost your G spot?  Yeah I actually thought  It was attached  To this guy  I was dating  And when we broke up  You know I thought  Wow that was so great  I really  For seven years? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah  You know nobody else  Was able to find it  Seven years  It was horrible  G spot doesn't work  Breaking a mirror  And then having bad luck  You know  Yeah  So I found my G spot  Because you know  I finally found another guy  Who could find it  And then I realized  It wasn't attached to him  Where was it?  Was it at the mall?  All of the girls  Was under the couch  Pushing  Oh Connor  Oh my  She's buried  Jiminy Cricket 
[03:32:00]  Oh boy  Alright  Well listeners  Have a few questions  I think  Right?  Yeah they're very excited  To talk to a  Sexpert  A sexpert  Right  Do you call yourself  A sexpert?  What is your title?  I'm a sexpert now  I'm actually the new  Sexpert for iVillage  So I'm a real sexpert now  What is iVillage?  iVillage is a women's website  It's you know  It's like a kind of  Compilation of magazine articles  From Cosmo  And all the major magazines  And health issues  And sex 
[03:32:30]  Alright  Let's go to Ken  Hold on a minute  Let's go to Ken  In Virginia  Stop it  Or you will not  Get your snorkel  And flippers  For Christmas  Ken?  Yes sir  Do you have a question  For the sexpert?  Absolutely  A couple of months ago  Little Connor  Was looking at  Whore's ass  And he came down  With a cold afterwards  And I was wondering  If she found anything  In her research  That correlates the two  Oh yeah  That is true  Connor  I was performing  Tushalingus 
[03:33:00]  Yeah  Tushalingus  And got a cold  And he got a cold  I had a cold  This is a true story  Yes  Is that possible  Shannon?  That's more than possible  But I don't know  If it's related  Okay  Huh  But if you only got a cold  You're lucky  Well you can't get anything  From that  It can't happen to me  What can you get  From Tushalingus? 
[03:33:30]  Herpes  Is transmittable  No it's not  From mouth to butt  Or anywhere  Is he eating logs bad?  I think you get  Something called  Stinkiest Tongiest  You know  Stink  I'm going to call  You got off easy  You could have  Gotten something bad  Alright  Why don't we  Why don't we say  Hi to Chris on Long Island  Chris you got a question?  Hi good morning guys  How are you?  Good  Morning Chris  Welcome to the program  Thanks  Hi Shannon  Hi  Hi  I just want to let you know  That my wife has read 
[03:34:00]  A couple of books  By Miss Frankel  She's a huge fan  She's great isn't she?  Yeah  Yeah  And I have a question for you  You were talking about  These successories  And a friend suggested  Something I wanted to know  My wife's teetering  Maybe I can push her  Over the edge  How do you feel about  I'd like her to  Defecate  On a plate  Preferably  On a plate?  Yeah  And then you know  Maybe she could  Microwave it  And when it gets 
[03:34:30]  Nice and hot  Run around the house  With it yelling  Donkey sausage  Have you heard of this  Before?  This donkey sausage  Phenomenon?  No  What's that?  Oh well it's this new thing  And it's really great  You just run around  With a plate full of  You know  Hot steaming defecation  Running around  Yelling donkey sausage  Donkey sausage  You know  And it's supposedly  A great turn on  But my wife hasn't  You know  She's kind of on the edge  She doesn't want to try it  Well that's a good question  Shannon  Donkey sausage  Yay or nay? 
[03:35:00]  Well you have to think  To get anyone to do anything  Especially the sex  You have to think  What's in it for them  Right  So now why is that  Going to be fun for her?  You have to figure something out  Shut up!  Shut up!  I think you have to come up  With a reason why  That's going to be fun  Right  For her  Well that's a great question  I think it's some type of  Fetish thing he was into  Yeah like if he wants to  Put down plastic bags  On the floor  And maybe have someone  Come over this afternoon  At 5.30  And you know  Drop logs on  Drop a few logs  Right  For $3.50  Alright let's go to 
[03:35:30]  Eric in Manhattan  Eric you have a question?  Yes I do  Alright  Quite often I have  Sex with my wife  In the balloon nut  Yeah  And when I pull out  I have a little surprise  Is that safe  And how do I clean that?  I think what he's saying  Is he pulled his  Does it say it right?  It's tush sex  And he pulled it out  And it looked like  His mule was wearing  An Abe Lincoln hat  Oh yeah  Oh gravy legs  Right  Well one thing's for sure  If she feels like  She's got to go to the bathroom  She does  So she ought to  Consider that  Before you start 
[03:36:00]  Because that's  You know  It's really not  A holding area  Right  Right  It's not a what?  It's not a holding area  No  So there really should be  Almost nothing in there  Yeah  Under normal conditions  So you should probably  Ask that  Okay  In advance  Alright  That's some good  Good questions  I must say  Good questions  Serious questions  Only from our listeners  Yeah who's this now?  Vivid Empire  Hey what's up?  Hi  I want to know  If this is considered  A glass coffee table book  And what is the best way  To introduce 
[03:36:30]  Scat to the woman?  Is this considered  A coffee table book?  No a glass coffee table book  A glass coffee table book  You can lay under it  And read it  Right  Well listen to it  Yeah it's not big enough  Chuck Berry records  It's not one of the big books  So I don't know  But it is  It does have like  A really cheerful  Chiclet looking cover  Right  So you could  You can read it on the subway  And nobody's going to think  Yeah  And what was the  The second part of your  Question  Yeah what was the second part?  What's the best way 
[03:37:00]  To introduce scat  To my wife  Scat  Scat  Like the  What the old singing?  That's what I think  I don't know  Just as a  Old gravy chest  Old gravy chest  Oh um  You know  Oh uh  You know having the girl  Uh uh  Uh like release herself  Number two on the chest  What?  Oh is that what that is?  Is that what scat is?  Yeah I think so  Wow  The euphemisms are amazing huh?  Yeah  Yeah we're learning 
[03:37:30]  We're trying to keep it clean  For broadcast  Um  Dude is that what scat is  When someone uses your chest  As a bowl?  Yeah so you could even  Sculpt it too  Huh  Sharon  I can't  Like I  I just  I default back to the  Why is it going to be fun for her?  Because that's the only way  To motivate anyone  To do anything  Well maybe  Maybe it's fun for her  Because the guy  Gets so turned on  By his fetish  And she knows  That she won't go to bed  With a blackened jaw  Well that  That's probably  With a blackened jaw  Right  That's always an incentive  Yeah really 
[03:38:00]  I know really  Connor  Connor  A good time  I mean if she really  Thinks that's going to be  Fun for you  Maybe she could be convinced  But that's going to be  A long shot  You probably should find  Somebody who has the same  Interest  Right right right  Alright we only have  Time for a few more  Questions here  Let's say hi to  Looks like  On Ray  On Ray  Hello everyone  How are you today?  Hello On Ray  Thank you for calling the program  Thank you  Thank you Care Bear  Shannon are you there?  Yeah  Okay good  I have a question for you  I'm currently dating 
[03:38:30]  Another man's girlfriend  I'm playing a bit of a devil  Myself if you understand  But my question  Is that  When  This gentleman  His name is Mark  When I have his girlfriend over  And she is performing  How I say  Oral treats  Yeah  That's a good way  Oral treats  On me  She tends to have a bit  Of a gag reflex  Very quickly  And I want to know  How to kind of  Maybe work her out of that  So I can  Perhaps push a little more down  If you understand what I mean 
[03:39:00]  You understand what I'm saying  Right  Yeah how do you get the girls  Open their throats  Yeah because this one  She seems to not be able to take  As much as I want to give her a cut  What do you think?  Yeah  Well maybe she's just not going to be able to  It sounds like she's already trying too hard  Or she shouldn't be gagging  But she should probably use her hand  At the same time  She does use her hand a little bit  But I try to push more  And not more than two or three inches going in  And then she tends to have  You know a tough time with that point 
[03:39:30]  I don't understand how I can maybe  Get her to be able to accept more  Without kind of you know  Having a gag reflex  Or what do you think?  Yeah well it's too much  It's too much  Maybe it's just too much  But there's nothing I can do  To try to help her get past that  So she has to  She can use her hand at the same time  But obviously it's going too far  She wouldn't be gagging  Because gagging happens pretty far back  Yeah  Maybe it's just too small now  Yeah  On Ray  Is that it On Ray? 
[03:40:00]  On Ray  On Ray  He punched out  Or his phone may have  I guess his phone might have gone out  It sounded like a cellular  Alright well  That was very good  Good question  Good answer  We got a couple of more  Yeah let's go to  Scott in  California  Scott in Modesto  Modesto  Scott  Yes hi  Little Connor  Nice  Hey there  I had a question for Shannon  I got in a little bit of legal trouble Shannon  Because my wife really wouldn't shut the hell up  And Connor you were there  You remember that right? 
[03:40:30]  I do  Yeah it was a really  She was a pain in my ass  And see Shannon  I'm surrounded only by guys now  Because of my little legal trouble  And because Amber's gone  And my wife is well  Not with us  So I was just wondering  Now that I'm surrounded by guys  How should I go about satisfying my desires  Surrounded by guys  You're in prison?  Yeah he's in prison  He calls our program a lot  Yeah  Okay  I'm trying to picture this  I know he's been in for about a year now  And a lot of the things that he enjoyed doing 
[03:41:00]  Fishing  Things like that  He's not able to do anymore  So I guess he wants to enjoy himself  Is it normal to go gay because you're in prison  I guess is what he wants to know  Well you know  The spectrum of kind of straight to gay  Is this continuum  And through history  Men tended to be kind of gay  Before they got married  Really?  Yeah  If you look at ancient Greece  And lots of parts of the world  Even now 
[03:41:30]  It's considered like a normal boys activity  That you outgrow  So it's not gay if you're single  Yeah I think the definition of gay and straight  Is all what you decide to call yourself  Well it's not gay if you don't push back  Whatever makes you feel like  Oh that's okay  I don't know if it's  Like whatever you call yourself  But I mean there are labels I think  That make some kind of sense right?  Yeah there are  I mean people who are not interested in having sex  Are the opposite sex ever?  Yeah  That's on the far end of gay 
[03:42:00]  But most people are somewhere in the middle  Somewhere in the middle  Finance circumstances  Freddie Krueger  Rob Halford  You could go out with girls  But then on the other hand  You're equally as comfortable  Maybe putting a java log in the fireplace  And having a glass of wine  Alright let's calm down  With another man in your pajamas  Let's relax  Perhaps  And that's absolutely acceptable  Well you know I think  If we didn't have social taboos  Around being gay  More people would be more fluid about it  I agree 
[03:42:30]  Right right  I agree  But do you think that's a bit faggoty  The scenario that Anthony just described  Two men just hanging out  Watching TV  With a fire going in their pajamas maybe  Glass of wine  Some cheese and crackers  Cheese and crackers  That sounds like a nice  Kind of almost  That's a date  It's a date right?  Yeah  That's a real date  That's what we were thinking  That kind of sounds like a date  Yep  Yeah  And then all of a sudden  The firemen show up  Oh it's fantastic  It's fabulous  And that's a porn film  Fabulous  Yeah 
[03:43:00]  Alright why don't we go on  To the next question  It's Bill in New Hampshire  Bill you have a question  For the sexpert  Oh Shannon  I sure do  Hey ONA  Nice  Hey sugar nuts  Hi  Alright  Bill what do you have for Shannon  Well something I've been feeling  Really weird about  For a long time  When I was young  Okay  I used to kind of experiment  With my friends  We'd hide under a porch  And play silly games 
[03:43:30]  Is that normal?  What do you mean  What do you mean silly games?  Well  We'd get under the porch  And  You know  We'd kind of  Gobble each other up  A little bit  I'd rest my head  On my friend's thigh  And  We'd just go from there  What?  Did you have any weird name  For this thing?  No  I was like a circle jerk  With oral sex  Oh  Well  We called it Monster Rain  Monster Rain  Monster Rain 
[03:44:00]  What kind of a sick idiot  Would come up with a name like that?  What is that?  Why Monster Rain?  What does the rain have to do with it?  Helen what do you think of that?  Well it was a good excuse  To get under the porch  We would pretend  It was raining monsters  Oh  Oh so the rain was coming  You guys would hide under the porch  And then  Right  Kind of  Give each other oral favors?  Exactly  Oh okay  So you know  It's little kids blowing each other  Yeah  Where do you stand on that?  Helen is that normal?  It seems like a thing  Yeah  It seems perfectly normal  I think Monster Rain is pretty creative  But 
[03:44:30]  Yeah  Oh there you go  Pretty creative  I feel a lot better about myself  Yeah  I mean how old are you  When that  Like when you and Jimmy Robinson  Don't do that anymore Helen  How old are you?  How old am I?  Or how old was I?  No no no  I'm asking this expert  How old is that  When you're not normal anymore  For doing that?  Well I don't know  If you're ever not normal for it  I mean  Because then you just  Well the bible says different  Huh?  At some point  You just cross over into gay  Alright  Right  Right  Once you've hit puberty  God willing  You know  Then you're just  Seeing guys instead of girls 
[03:45:00]  Under the porch  Yeah  No that  Yeah but  That seems like a normal  Kid thing  Yeah Bill  Don't worry about it  Thank you for the question  Yeah that's  Thanks Bill  I like that one actually  Let's go to New Mexico  And talk to Mike  Mike what's going on?  Not a whole lot  How's it going on eh?

[03:47:00]  Is that uh  I enjoy my ladies of the night  Like usual  And um  I have a hard habit  Of laying on my back  And having them  Urinate on my throat  Mmhmm  Um  I need to get over this  Because I'm running  Out of money  My mother's getting  Very distraught  Over this situation  You told your mother  About that?  My mother actually  Left a message  On my answer  Oh my god  You know what  Oh my god  Okay yeah  Uh Shannon  We do have that phone call  Oh no please don't  We do have that phone call  But uh  Shannon we'd love to play this  It's a message  That uh  Little Jimmy's uh  Mother

[03:48:00]  We love it by the way  And you were talking  About giving up  You know ladies of the evening  Um which is a wonderful thing  But you know what  Dr. Phil always says  Replace something with something  So I was thinking  You know you have  That nice gym downstairs  And you know  Just for like 20 minutes  To a half an hour  And you would feel better  Use that  And also there's gyms  In New York  You could go  You could exercise  And uh  You would feel  A whole lot better 
[03:48:30]  You'd lose a little weight  You'd tone up  And you relieve  You know tension and stuff  And you'd be meeting  Other people  I don't know honey  I just thought  It might be a good thing  I'm sorry  I'm interfering  I know  I just  I'm thinking of you  Nobody knows I'm calling  So uh  Don't get offended  Or think I'm strange  But I am a mother  And I worry about you  You're doing so well  Everything's falling into place  This might be just one of the  You know  The health thing  It would help  It would help you sweetheart  Well anyway  That's it  I'm not going to go on  I know it's not my business

[03:49:30]  Dr. Phil says to replace things  And that he should go to the gym  Is that basically  He's kind of  Fat breasted  And awful  And that picking up prostitutes  Is probably the only option  Until he does a few crunches  Well she said that really nicely  If that's what she was saying  Actually  I'd like to play right now  The uh  A phone call that uh  Our own Connor's mother  Uh  Made to uh  Connor  Oh yeah  On the show  Hi uh  Connor  It's mom  Next stop

[03:55:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[03:56:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[03:56:30]  Hello?  Hello? 
[03:57:00]  Hello?  Hello? 
[03:57:30]  So, we're about to end the program.  Yep.  Okay.  We're about to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What did you guys think of Shannon?  She was all right, huh?  Yeah.  Very good.  I thought she went on a little long, but it was all right.  It was a good segment.  I thought she was very nice, but she got a little rude at the end. 
[03:58:00]  I think she was pissed off at us.  I don't know why she was unhappy with us.  No, no.  I think she thought that some of the callers were making fun of her or something.  No.  She didn't have to have an attitude about it.  No.  I kind of understand some of our listeners are just stupid.  No.  She didn't really sound like an expert on sex.  Yeah, a lot of people are putting books out lately just to probably make a profit and rip  people off.  Why did she hang up on us?  Why did she hang up on us?  I didn't.  I didn't. 
[03:58:30]  I don't understand.  I think we treated her nice and she hung up on us like that.  Oh, no.  I didn't hang up.  I was going to plug the book again, but if she's angry at us, there's no reason for her  to be angry.  I don't know why she hung up on us.  I think that she probably thought-  She sounded so nice at the beginning of the call and then at the end-  I thought we were having fun, but all of a sudden she hung up a couple of times.  Yeah.  I was ready to call her a bitch or something.  I mean, I'm enjoying this book.  I didn't really want to go there, but I didn't know what to do.  All of a sudden, we were left out there with an uncomfortableness that- 
[03:59:00]  I've never been hung up like that.  No, no.  Three times the same.  She hung up three times, man.  It was like there's no reason for it.  No.  Sometimes I understand we have phone problems, but for the most part-  We had phone problems.  I don't know why she would do that.  And there was a couple-  Can you hear me?  She seemed nice at first.  Wow.  The instant feedback are calling her the C word for some reason.  Why?  No, no, no.  For what?  I don't think she was that bad.  A little bitchy, maybe, but I wouldn't use the C word.  They could probably sense how like-  Well, that was really rude to be talking and all of a sudden she's gone.  I know.  Just hanging up like that. 
[03:59:30]  Wait, she's there?  Hello?  I'm here.  Shannon?  Hello?  Yes.  I'm here.  Can you hear me?  Program complete.  That's it for the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Golly gosh.

[04:01:00]  I never did like breaking up with people.  And I guess everybody here is broken up with somebody.  We've all heard the breakup lines.  There's a million of them.  I was picking out a few of my favorites.  Like, I need some space.  Which is half a sentence.  The rest of it is without you in it.  I think my all-time favorite,  I think we should start seeing other people.  Trust me, nobody's ever said that one to you  without having somebody else in mind.  Guys, if a woman says to you, 
[04:01:30]  I think we should start seeing other people.  Trust me, she has already cut a pony from the herd.  And if she ain't riding him yet,  she has pulled the saddle out of the barn.  What else is going on?  What about the 70s and, um...  What about...  What about...  You tell me, what were you doing in the moment?  I'm sorry.  Since the shit just hit you.  What about the 70s?  Cause this damn show ain't Ricky Lake, so... 
[04:02:00]  What about the 70s?  And when people started growing their hair and then...  What do you want to know about the 70s?  The 70s was a cool time, I think.  The 70s, I mean, I was a young boy, so, you know,  going through my trials, my tribulations,  but I think they were cool.  I think people were together at that time.  You know, you got together, had your little drink on,  you could party like a motherfucker, chill,  you know, everybody had their shit.  Now everybody got an attitude. 
[04:02:30]  Nobody don't really respect nobody.  You know, you get on the dance floor,  you scared to bump into a motherfucker.  If your shit too...  You can have your motherfucker dance on,  bump into the wrong motherfucker.  Bow, excuse me, slam.  No, nigga, bitch, forgot my Big Mac.  Now you bump into...  Go, go, go, go, go, go!  Go, go, go, go!  Go, go, go, go, go!  Go, go, go, go, go!  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.
