<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in sarcastic banter that quickly devolved into simulated angry arguments.  The conversation then shifted to movie reviews, with critiques of *Scarface*'s aging effects and praise for Jackie Gleason in a CB radio movie, alongside speculation about a black remake of *Scarface*.  This was followed by the playing and harsh criticism of listener-submitted jingles, one of which contained extremely homophobic lyrics.

A large portion of the show was dedicated to mocking Don and Mike, a rival radio show, focusing heavily on Don Geronimo accidentally killing his dog, Rudy.  Clips from Don and Mike's show were played and ridiculed, leading to a comedic back-and-forth.  The hosts discussed the changing radio landscape, mentioning satellite radio's impact and the negative reaction to a New York oldies station's format change.  Numerous listener calls contributed to the show's chaotic and often offensive tone.  Two listener-submitted audio pieces were played: a darkly humorous diary entry from an unborn child's perspective detailing its death and blaming its mother, and a similar diary from Rudy the dog, culminating in its death.  The segment concluded with the playing of a seemingly unrelated audio clip.

The next segment included crude, sexually suggestive jokes about a *Good Morning America* segment featuring a woman with a corrected spinal curvature.  The hosts discussed the XM Satellite Radio and Audible partnership, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's movie and relationship, and a CNBC stock show host known for screaming.  A lengthy discussion about Opie's ex-girlfriend, her alleged relationships with Denzel Washington and Jeff Gordon, and her eccentric behavior followed.  The segment also featured Paul Anka's song covers, including a comedic version of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit," along with audio of Anka yelling at his band.  A planned interview with Osama Bin Laden's niece was mentioned but not conducted.  A segment about over-40 cheerleaders was briefly discussed and played.

The show continued with a crude anecdote about a birth, followed by a lengthy, dark, and violent reading of a story called "Little Marky," detailing a dysfunctional and abusive family.  Several audio clips were played, including a listener-submitted Star Trek-themed remix of R. Kelly songs.  A discussion about a breastfeeding protest outside ABC Studios, sparked by Barbara Walters' comments, ensued, leading to a vulgar conversation about breastfeeding.  An interview with Indy 500 driver Brian Hurta followed, interspersed with unrelated questions and a brief interaction with another radio host, Bruce Kelly.  The segment concluded with more calls, further discussion of the breastfeeding protest, and various other snippets.

The final segment centered on the Barbara Walters breastfeeding controversy, featuring graphic descriptions of breasts and breastfeeding, along with humorous and offensive anecdotes.  The hosts discussed the lactivist protest, Seal and Heidi Klum's relationship, a caller's experience witnessing breastfeeding, pictures of older children breastfeeding, and personal opinions on the topic.  Significant airtime was dedicated to playing audio clips of Mayor Menino of Boston and Mike Tyson.  A discussion about grammar and a caller criticizing Jim Norton's comedy also occurred.  Beyond Opie, Anthony, and producer Ben, no other guests were identified in this segment.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  We owe me an Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  A family member dies. 
[00:04:30]  A family member dies.  And you insult me.  What the hell is the matter with you anyway?  Oh, God.  Call me sir, God damn it.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  You just mind your P's and Q's, Buster.  And remember who you're dealing with.  As soon as I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch your mama in the mouth. 
[00:05:00]  Hello, exactly.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich, a Dr. Pepper.  Make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Oh, my God.  That's an attention getter.  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law.  O-N-A, Barney Rock. 
[00:05:30]  O-N-A, Barney Rock.  That's an attention getter.  O-N-A, Barney Rock.  And that's nothing but pure and simple old-fashioned communism.  It happens every time one of those dancers starts poong-tanging around with those joke-o-facts.  Joke-o-facts.  Oh, the amazing Gleeson.  You know what?  I watched that movie a couple months ago.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  It stinks on ice except for Jackie Gleeson.  Yeah.  You think the movie itself would hold up?  It's awful.  It's pure 70s.  You know what it is, though?  It doesn't hold up, but it's one of those nostalgic movies that you can watch,  understanding that it was the stupid 70s and the CB radio thing.  Some movies you can't even watch anymore.  Gleeson's great in that, though.  Yeah.  You know one of those movies you can't watch anymore?  And it's one of those movies everyone talks about?  The rap community when they show Cribs.  Every single one of them has to have it in their DVD collection? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Scarface.  Scarface.  Yeah.  Great movie, obviously, but the blood is ridiculously fake.  Yeah, the gunfire sounds stink.  The gunfire is awful.  Imagine that movie updated.  I mean, it would be tough to do, obviously, but...  Aren't they going to do it?  No.  I thought somebody was tossing it around.  How do you redo Pacino's?  I know.  I know.  This is what's going to happen with Scarface.  Mark my word, okay?  And I swear I haven't read this anywhere.  There'll be a black version. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, eventually there will be.  There'll be a black version of Scarface.  You watch.  Some rapper.  Yeah, because the whole rap community loves it.  You know, P. Diddy or somebody will get the boys together,  and they'll do a little black Scarface for everyone.  I can't wait to see that.  That's going to be great.  You a part of Smokey and Bandit does hold up, by the way,  when they're riding in the song,  they call you the bandit.  And that song is playing.  That holds up.  The worst part of the movie.  The romantic love interest part. 
[00:07:30]  Do you want to take your hat off?  Oh, schmuck.  With the wonderful Sally Field.  How about the wig?  Take that off, too, Bert.  And soccer in the mouth.  Yeah.  Have a buncher in your Trans Am.  You know what we used to do in college?  We used to take movies like that.  But Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a perfect example of what we used to do.  And we would just make a Spicoli tape.  Oh, really?  So it was like a 15-minute version of the movie,  but it was all the great stuff.  Yeah, the fun stuff.  Yeah, you didn't have to waste time going through the whole movie  to get to the classic lines.  But how do you cut out Damone out of Fast Times? 
[00:08:00]  Damone, probably the funniest character in Fast Times.  Spicoli's got a few lines that are the standout classic lines,  but Damone is hysterical.  Yeah, you turned me on to Damone.  I've got to be honest with you.  I wasn't a big fan of Damone until I started doing radio with you  and realized, yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  You're right.  Earth, wind, and fire, and little brother.  With the scarf with the piano keys on.  Yeah, well.  That's great. 
[00:08:30]  I don't even like Damone as much as I like you doing Damone.  I think I prefer you to the actual Damone.  Your assistant to the assistant manager at a movie theater.  I love that guy.  What's this?  Black Scarface equals belly.  What?  I don't know what this means.  Matt?  Yes.  Hello?  Let's go, Matt.  Oh, what's up, guys?  Opie Anthony, Dr. Jimmy.  I just wanted to say that I am my news man.  Hey, check it out.  There is already a black Scarface.  It's called belly. 
[00:09:00]  Uh-huh.  Belly?  Belly, yeah.  It's got Method Man, a bunch of other dudes.  I don't really know all the different rappers, but it's called belly.  What's it about?  A Coke dealer?  The same type of film or the same film?  Yeah, exactly.  It's the same kind of thing.  It's got like one of them rappers goes and he starts off small and becomes a Coke dealer.  And then they get this other dude from Jamaica to get him in into the game deeper.  And then they start taking to other cities.  The same fucking plot, though, if you watch the movie.  But is the personality the same as it was for Pacino and Scarface? 
[00:09:30]  The personality, dude.  Jimmy, you stink.  It's a black person.  No, you're done, Matt.  Thank you, Matt.  It came out in 1998 and none of us know the movie.  No?  No.  Never heard of it, sir.  Never heard of it, sir.  It's supposed to be a Scarface video game.  That's supposed to be coming out.  What's his name was talking about?  Yeah, Laszlo was talking about that one.  Laszlo was talking about that last week, right?  The Scarface video game and then the 50 Cent one, which was just 50 running around shooting 
[00:10:00]  up white people.  That looks good, though.  Here we go, Anthony.  Yes.  Remember yesterday we were talking about jingles?  Yes, we were.  Radio jingles.  Because CBS FM here in New York, the oldie station, got flipped the format.  They went to Jack.  And they're one of those stations that depended on their jingles.  The oldie stations always have the jingles.  So the old people know what they're listening to.  CBS FM, New York. 
[00:10:30]  One of those.  Yeah.  All right, yeah, we can give you an example of that.  By the way, Elo text messaged me yesterday.  Don't forget to tell your listeners that all these are alive on XM Satellite Radio.  All right, relax.  Thank you, Travis.  You're welcome.  Good morning, Mr. Breakfast.  101.1 WCBS FM, New York. 
[00:11:00]  Nice, right?  That's it.  That's a nice jingle.  It's like high energy and you know where you are.  You're happy, familiar territory.  Well, we asked our listeners for jingles.  Got the paper towels.  What happened?  I might make a mess.  Oh.  Thank you.  So we asked our listeners for jingles and the first one came in, Anthony.  No, the first one's in already?  It's called...  Yesterday.  Yesterday.  I know.  It's called, I don't know, homophobic O&A or something like that. 
[00:11:30]  That's the word this guy says in the beginning of this.  All right.  I had to listen to this three or four times.  Homophobic.  To get the fact that he was saying homophobic.  Right.  I figured I'd help the listeners along this morning.  Here's the first jingle that came in for the Opie and Anthony program.  Homophobic, homophobic, homophobic, D-O-B-N, Anthony's show.  That is awful. 
[00:12:00]  There's the first jingle.  I like it.  It's catchy.  It's got a soothing flavor to it.  Soothing.  Wow.  They'll be humming this later, though.  Homophobic, homophobic, homophobic.  Homophobic, D-O-B-N, Anthony's show.  It's got a dentist drill quality to it.  It's kind of creepy.  That is annoying, creepy, and like...  Ugh.  I'm angered when I hear it. 
[00:12:30]  Homophobic, homophobic, homophobic, D-O-B-N, Anthony's show.  There you go.  Awful.  That's what we get.  I like that.  That's our first jingle.  Here we are.  Where's...  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah, something like fast-paced.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Not...  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[00:13:00]  Ooh, that's creepy.  I kind of like it.  I love it.  I think it's upbeat.  Upbeat.  Jesus.  Look at a nice up-tempo number.  Whirling Dervish from Canada.  Hey, guys, I heard a rumor that oldies are alive and well on XM.  Is that fucking true?  Of course it is.  Elo said it.  Yeah, Elo just keeps text messaging me about that.  No one cares.  Tell them.  Tell them, Opie.  The reason the format's going away, no one cares.  The ratings were in the toilet.  It's so funny. 
[00:13:30]  Maybe the rest of the country could care less about it,  but it's making Anthony and I laugh every day  because there's articles in the paper every day about this CBS going away  because it was a huge station for a lot of people.  And now I've got to find the article.  They did a bunch of other columns in the paper today.  Pat from Munaki, who did that jingle, Liddy?  Yeah, it kind of sounds like Liddy.  Funny.  And can we please kill this bit before it even starts?  Holy shit, that's awful. 
[00:14:00]  That's belt of scotch.  Wow, a lot of people requesting that we play it again, Anthony.  Oh, I'd love to hear it again.  Mike from Whackbag, this jingle has cancer.  I don't think people are understanding.  Someone shoot the guy who did that.  That stinks.  Maybe they haven't heard it enough times.  You've got to grow on you a little bit.  Yeah, I think we have to play it a few more times  before you can make that decision.  Ben's raw ass, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, sweet tits.  Hi, Ben's raw ass. 
[00:14:30]  I swear to God, I am going to fucking kill myself.  Why?  I fucking hate that.  There's something, and I'm not kidding,  there's something really annoying about it  where it's making me angry to hear it.  Yeah, because you can't just say that it's bad.  Horrible.  You know how Karma Chameleon calms down, Jimmy?  Yeah.  That makes me mad.  It really does.  I don't know what it is.  It's not that it's great, obviously,  but it's not bad. 
[00:15:00]  There's just something else about it  that gets under your skin.  It should be used as a weapon.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Oh.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  I am so angered by this.  And then it just ends.  No name or anything?  Just unknown submission?  Ray from Deer Park.  Thank you, Ray.  You're a star today, buddy.  Deer Park, the town that brought you the guy 
[00:15:30]  that chained his wife in the basement  and kept leopards in his house.  Oh, okay.  That was from Deer Park.  All right.  We had that guy in the show.  Yeah.  Remember the time we had, what was it, a leopard?  It was a tiger.  A tiger?  Yeah, a baby Bengal tiger.  And some guy from Long Island brought it in.  And it turns out...  Remember he had a baby elephant downstairs in the truck?  He said he had a baby elephant.  And we're like, no, no, no.  There's no way we're going to be able to get that pad in the elevator. 
[00:16:00]  Building security.  Yeah.  We got a tiger in, but not an elephant.  He was serious.  He wanted to bring it up in a freight elevator or something.  Yeah.  But we got the tiger in, and it turns out that guy was the guy on Long Island.  Yeah, that chained his wife downstairs.  The guy that brought the tiger in the NAW?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the guy?  Yeah.  Me and Ben seem to recognize his face and his name.  Wow.  We're almost positive, yeah.  Yeah.  There's a picture of the little tiger. 
[00:16:30]  Wasn't he cute?  I got pictures of me and you petting him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's one right there.  That's your site.  Is that tiger still alive, or is that one of the tigers they found dead?  They didn't find a tiger dead.  Didn't they find something in our freezer or something?  No, it was some dead dog or something.  Oh, okay.  The guy was a little weird, that's for sure.  It was scary to pet the thing, though, because cats scratch at you.  It's just their natural thing to be playful.  Yeah.  And this was a cub, and the awful meat paws on this thing.  It couldn't have killed you at that age, but it could have hurt you badly.  It really hurt, yeah.  Yeah, it grabbed my pant leg. 
[00:17:00]  I remember that with one of its claws.  It went right through the pants.  Yeah, a little tiger cub.  I'm just amazed we were able to get that up into the studio.  I know.  I mean, did he want to pay the elephant up or something, but he couldn't?  You're kidding, right?  Did he do that on purpose?  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I've got to turn my mic off.  You scared the hell out of me.  Did I?  I was just kind of preoccupied reading the paper.  Oh, you did?  Hello?  Hello?  What, sweetie?  What do you need?  There you go.  I didn't turn it off.  Did you turn it off? 
[00:17:30]  Maybe I did.  Let's turn it off.  Let me see.  It's on, Bic.  All right, it's off?  It's on.  There you go.  I'm in complete control.  You can control your own mic.  I'm in complete control.  All right.  Wow, the phones have lit up because of the jingle.  Tony in St. Louis.  What's up, Tony?  Hey, boys.  Hi.  Just the jingle was bothering me, and the Beverly Hills cop that...  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, and then...  Actual F.  Yeah.  Yeah, and then the Halloween theme, or the dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. 
[00:18:00]  You know what I'm talking about.  Yeah, the exorcist theme or the Halloween theme.  Yeah, anyway, that's all I had to say.  But they should probably trash that thing.  I disagree, sir.  No, we're going to play them at least ten more times today.  Brian and Philly, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, that jingle sounds like one of those deranged music box.  Jack in the Box is a slasher movie.  Yeah, definitely.  We should sell it as a ringtone.  Probably make millions.  All right.  Thanks, Brian.  Let's go to Ron in Boston.  Ron? 
[00:18:30]  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Ron.  All I can think of hearing that jingle is that mind-control light from Star Trek spinning around.  Mind-control.  And I think you should just keep playing it all morning until someone's sensing a decent jingle.  I'm out.  All right.  There he goes.  Ron in Boston.  Well, I mean, here's an example of a professional jingle, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  I'm ready to rock and roll.  Because I'm bruising. 
[00:19:00]  This really annoys me, too.  And as we said in the 60s, yee, yee, yee.  We did.  Testing.  Testing.  Everybody who loves the 60s, say, baby.  Say, baby.  Say, baby.  Don't you want to tap your feet now, baby?  As we said in the 60s, yee, yee.  What does that mean?  Maybe when you show an interracial couple walk in, you're like, hey. 
[00:19:30]  As we said in the 60s, yee, yee, shoot that gook.  Yee, yee.  Yee, yee.  Yee, yee.  Set the dogs in the fire hoses on them.  Hey, look who moved into the neighborhood.  Yee, yee.  Yee, yee.  As we said in the 60s, yee, yee.  Yee, yee.  Yee, yee, yee, they're my neighbors.  Well, that's not a good example of a jingle.  That's more of a show opener.  Yeah.  Here's a good example of a jingle.  We played already, but just to give you the contrast. 
[00:20:00]  An example of a professional jingle, and this is what we got so far.  Oh, no.  Homophobic, homophobic, homophobic, D-O-V-E-N, Anthony Shaw.  Oh, my God.  You've got to stop playing that. 
[00:20:30]  I've got to disagree, Ed.  I think it's fantagious.  It is horrid.  Great.  Well, it can only get better from there, huh?  Yeah, of course it will.  All right.  There you go.  The first jingle has arrived.  We expect many, many more.  Yeah, they're losing their minds over this oldies thing in New York.  It's so funny, because one of the monkeys, Mickey Dolenz.  Mickey Dolenz. 
[00:21:00]  I guess he was the morning guy at this oldies format here in New York City.  Yeah.  And he was celebrating his...  Who did he play on the monkeys?  Mickey.  That's right.  I forgot.  Mickey.  Anyway, he was the morning man, and he was celebrating his hundredth show.  Not just celebrating.  He was doing a live remote.  That's right.  Mickey Dolenz, the morning host, learned the same day he held an on-air blowout marking his 
[00:21:30]  hundredth show.  So, I'm telling you, man, this business stinks.  It absolutely stinks.  We're just trying to make as much money as possible before we're fired again.  And then we're out forever, it looks like, right?  Probably.  Well, we'll probably go our different ways and do different things.  I don't know.  But this is it.  But these radio companies just stink.  They don't care about the performers whatsoever.  They don't even care about the formats, as long as it's making money.  As soon as that format's not making money anymore, then they move on to the next hot 
[00:22:00]  format.  That's the reality.  And do people get treated like this in any other business?  Do you walk into, like, Apple computers to work one day, and they just go, no, we're  a Windows dealer now.  We make Windows.  So, you're out.  We're bringing all new people in.  Everyone, go home.  You're fired.  Does that even happen?  Well, do they give him any notice at all, or no?  No.  None notice. 
[00:22:30]  This is what makes me laugh really hard.  Mickey Dolan.  The guy's celebrating his 100th show.  He doesn't have a clue.  He's partying.  He's partying.  He hasn't really done...  I don't think he's done any radio before.  So, this is his gig.  He's into it.  So, the station decides to throw a 100th show party for him at...  Where was it?  BB King's.  So, he wasn't even in the studio.  It was a big deal.  They had to promote this thing and get it together and organize it.  While he was out doing his remote, they were probably pulling the records and replacing 
[00:23:00]  them with the Jack records as he was doing his show.  So, it says, Mickey Dolan's, the morning host, learned the same day he held an on-air blowout  marking his 100th show that he was going to get fired and the station was going away.  And then this guy, Vincent, he says, I'm fuming.  He's a listener.  I'm fuming, said Vincent.  Who was at Dolan's show at BB King's?  What the heck do you have a big live broadcast for to celebrate a positive thing and hours  later to span the whole goddamn thing? 
[00:23:30]  Oh.  And then this lady, Eileen, who sounds like she could be the old lady from Boston.  No.  I come home.  Yeah, you want to read this as the old lady?  Where is it?  I don't know.  Right here.  I'll circle it.  Yeah, you'll circle that.  Because old people listen to this.  That's about it.  Right.  I come home and all of a sudden there's some wacko music on my station and some guy like  Big Brother saying, change is good, said Eileen Oster of Bayside. 
[00:24:00]  Why didn't they announce it to us and give us some recourse?  You're kidding.  Who is this station is this?  Oh, no.  Jack?  This isn't the right Jack.  Why didn't they give some recourse? 
[00:24:30]  What recourse?  You changed the dial.  How about throwing yourself into the trash compactor, you old bag of meat?  Old bitty.  I'm worried about her station.  Old recourse.  Buy an iPod, bitch.  Yeah.  And then there's this guy.  2005, you idiot.  You can shoot yourself.  Then there's this guy, Oster.  We don't want to be treated like that.  Anybody who jacks something basically hijacks something.  What?  And then Michael Hart of Staten Island. 
[00:25:00]  The people who made this decision don't know Jack.  Hey, that's a clever one because the format is...  Wow.  Getting another text message from Elo.  Ooh, what was it saying?  Don't forget.  Holdies is alive and well on XM Satellite Radio.  Thank you, Elo.  Well, Logan once said about a format flip, if you flip a format, people that are currently  enjoying that music will not be enjoying it once it's flipped.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:25:30]  That's what he said.  That's good.  That is the most annoying thing ever.  Well, the banana is really good.  Dude, that's more annoying than the jingle.  I'm doing that to the...  I'm doing the jingle tune.  You know what?  With my banana.  If you're going to do that, I'm going to play the jingle.  No!  Either finish the banana or I hit play.  It's your decision.  It's your decision.  It's your decision. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  It didn't work.  Oh.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  The OPN and the show.  Homophobic.  You know what?  Yeah.  I dare you to play it again.  Oh, stop.  No.  That is really awful.  Tim and I will play the OCD game because we're both ridiculous with our OCDs. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, he'll keep saying it.  You'll keep playing it.  It'll be hours and hours.  But I actually like the jingle.  It's a double good thing for me.  In a weird way, I think I like it, too.  Oh, accident of the day.  What do we got?  A tractor trailer.  No, that's not the accident of the day.  That's a good one.  That's a good one, but it's off the road.  What about the 18-wheeler that was trying to...  What was he trying to do?  He was trying to get under the battery tunnel underpass, and he made it through, and then 
[00:27:00]  there's a sign, which I don't understand.  You can make it through the tunnel, but then there's a sign on an I-beam that says low clearance,  and he hit the sign and knocked that whole thing down into the roadway.  So no going from the FDR to the West Side Highway today.  No, he's completely...  Well, he's halfway out of the tunnel.  The tunnel's stuck.  Almost made it.  On the bottom, you mean?  It's not like it's a big tunnel or anything.  It's not like a lot of people use that one. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  People are so effed today because of this trucker.  But no death and destruction.  No.  This morning.  Well, that other one looks pretty bad.  All right, Anthony, another radio news.  Yes.  Our old pals Don and Mike playing into our hands once again.  That's a good show.  Oh.  Our old pals Don and Mike.  Yeah.  Who are losing affiliates all over America.  Yeah.  But they're going to try to make fun of us.  They're dwindling empire. 
[00:28:00]  They're going to try to take shots at us when they're losing affiliates all over the country.  All over the country.  Mm-hmm.  So, it's like we said off the air, if there's one group, if there's one show we don't need  on our backs, it's those two.  Oh.  They're frightening.  And I guess one of our pests got through to the program to make fun of his dead dog.  Oh, that's good.  The story for the new listeners, Anthony?  Well, it seems Don and his wife, Frida, and little Bart, his son, have had, sorry, 
[00:28:30]  a little doggy named Rudy, a little dog named Rudy, and they loved the dog, and it was a  very happy little dog to have around the family, and I guess Don was backing out of the driveway  one morning to leave for work.  Tragedy struck.  He ran over little Rudy. 
[00:29:00]  Little Rudy just crushed him.  You know, you've got to give them credit.  They're big in Afternoon Drive in Washington, D.C., but that's it.  Yeah.  They're one of those one-market shows.  Simple as that.  That's it.  They've tried.  They've tried to branch out.  They're in the same company as Howard Stern.  Howard Stern's going away to go do some satellite, and these guys aren't good enough to take 
[00:29:30]  over for the big dog.  Simple as that.  Yep.  I mean, there's an incredible opportunity at Infinity Broadcasting, and Don and Mike aren't  going to get the slot.  They're just not.  And they ain't it.  You guys are gone, and Howard's leaving.  It's not like you guys are even there.  There's no one.  Who else is there that's going to take that spot?  And that does show that the company has no faith in you.  You guys have been there for a long time.  Well, they have absolutely no faith in these guys, but they're going to turn around and  try to take shots at us? 
[00:30:00]  You might have faith in a show if they could go to another market and succeed.  They can't.  They're proven failures in syndication.  Proven failures.  Look at their track record.  They're in D.C.  They've been there forever.  They do well in D.C.  There you go.  They never got over the fact that even though they were doing well in afternoon drive in  Washington, they were kicked to middays, which is the worst radio shift to ever have because  no one cares. 
[00:30:30]  Because just think about your life, most people out there anyway, you're working during middays.  No one listens to the radio during middays.  And if they are, it's kind of a background thing.  So we kicked them out of their slot in Washington, and they never got over it.  Yeah.  Because when we got syndicated, they threw us an afternoon drive all over the country.  It was Howard in the morning and us and afternoon drive at most of these stations.  Yep.  And they were kicked to midday.  Kicked to middays.  And then they tried, you know, the biggest markets in the country, you know, New York 
[00:31:00]  City.  They just failed miserably in New York.  Philly, just thrown right out of Philly.  No one wanted to hear them.  Recently, they got kicked out of Buffalo.  There's a few others, but they have a track record of failure.  Except for Washington.  Yeah.  Except for Washington.  Something clicks in Washington.  There are these shows like Don and Mike, they do great in one particular market.  They're one market show.  Lex and Terry, same thing, you know.  They do great in, where are they, Jacksonville, I guess? 
[00:31:30]  I don't know.  And they're syndicated to some small, tiny little media markets here and there.  But basically, they're another show that's great in one city.  You know, where we were proven successful in syndication, they are proven failures.  They failed.  You know, we got ourselves thrown off the air.  Got to give them that.  They haven't done that.  That's true.  They didn't get themselves fired.  But, you know, we were proven success, successes in our syndication. 
[00:32:00]  They're proven failures.  That's all there is to it.  That's it.  You failed.  They bombed in Philly so horribly.  Oh!  Horrible.  Horrible.  And Philly is a phenomenal market.  It's an amazing radio market.  It's an amazing radio market.  The fans are animals, and they're loyal, and they're just savage pests.  Right.  And the fact that you couldn't grab any of them once the show was kicked off the air.  All right, well, let's go to the tape and hear what they had to say about us yesterday. 
[00:32:30]  Is this going to upset us?  I don't know.  I haven't even heard it yet.  Oh, no.  I haven't even heard it yet.  Let's go to it.  Don and Mike show.  Hello, Don.  Yes, and Mike.  Hello there.  Hi.  Do you think your dog was disappointed in your driving skills?  Mike.  The dog embraced death. 
[00:33:00]  Imagine what it's like.  They actually found a note.  Yeah.  The dog killed himself.  He said, I'd rather lick my ass than have Don breathe in my face.  Don's awful breath in my face.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  The dog used to actually start licking Don's mouth because he thought he was licking his  ass.  He'd be like, oh, shit.  That's not my ass.  That's Don Geronimo's mouth.  Smells the same.  But unfunny things don't come out of my ass. 
[00:33:30]  My ass wouldn't get kicked out of Philly.  Shit.  Go ahead.  Don and Mike show.  Hello, Don.  Yes, and Mike.  Hello there.  Hi.  Do you think your dog was disappointed in your driving skills?  My dog was disappointed in what driving skills?  You get it, Buzz.  Yeah.  Sometimes you get these obscure...  I'm ashamed of myself.  You're referring to the time that you backed...  I know, but what is that...  Oh, okay.  I realize that I...  But it's not a good joke.  No.  Hold on.  I realize I ran over my dog. 
[00:34:00]  But who's talking about driving skills?  I mean, was anybody talking about driving skills?  Is that the best comeback you have, you fat fuck?  Yeah, I think it's about that time I ran over my dog, huh?  Driving skills?  Yeah.  What does that have to do with driving skills?  How about looking in your mirror, dope?  That's a driving skill.  How about not running over something?  Isn't not running over something the whole thing to driving skills?  It certainly is.  I think... 
[00:34:30]  I think the whole thing to being a skilled driver is to get from point A to point B and not kill your dog.  Is that your idea?  Like, you don't think that's a driving skill thing?  Like, you're blaming the animal?  He's all flustered.  Fucking fatso?  Dude, he's flustered at this point.  Who's having a driving skill?  Driving skill, huh?  Let's go back.  He's thinking of Frida listening and freaking out again.  Because every time they have sex, she, like, looks at him.  And then as soon as his eyes lock on her, her head turns away quickly and it teardrops. 
[00:35:00]  She doesn't want to see old doggy killer breathing on her.  That's right.  His dog-murdering breath.  It was her special dog.  His heaving, dog-killing fat body on top of her.  She used to, like, take her little pointer finger and go,  on the top of its little head.  And under its little chin and its little head would look up with love.  Look up.  His little ears would flop back.  And he'd look up with the big eyes.  And the last thing I thought of is,  why can't she help me now?  Oh.  This whole tragedy is going to turn into an unfunny blog post. 
[00:35:30]  And you bet it did.  It shouldn't be a blog.  It should be a block.  All right.  Let's go back to the tape.  Well, this guy was.  Right.  But, I mean, we were talking about the other world.  You didn't talk about that thing you were talking about.  You talked about that in the office, right?  What?  Sometimes what we talk about in the office runs together that you were out for a drive.  You were talking about, you know, when you went out for a drive to me.  No, I see.  But I didn't.  You didn't talk about that on the air. 
[00:36:00]  No.  So where's this coming from?  That's just some guy.  Some random force Joe Satt.  Some jerk.  Oh, I wonder if that's from the Opie and Anthony army.  I'd be scared if that army was going to call our show today  and try to barrage and get through with all of their calls about my dead dog.  I don't know.  I'm just guessing.  We couldn't go on if that happened.  I'm just guessing.  If that's the case yet, we'll have to shut down the phone lines.  That's right.  It wasn't anything.  It was just some guy calling. 
[00:36:30]  It was just one of our listeners that was bored and knew he could get under your skin,  so he called your stupid show, you fat fuck.  Believe me, it would fuck up your show if our listeners just hounded your phones all day.  Because you'd have to be aware that every call coming in, and you'd have to call them back.  How come...  It is a pain in the ass.  Why can't he acknowledge that?  It really is a pain in the ass when our pest listeners decide to assault the show.  It is.  The screeners really got to be on the mark.  They tie up phone lines.  They're awful people. 
[00:37:00]  We know.  We've drank with them.  They're horrible humans.  They really are.  How come no Don and Mike fans ever call this show?  We wouldn't hang up on you or run away from it.  We would address it.  They don't really have fans.  Exactly.  They have listeners.  They have people that listen.  Kind of enjoy it, but there's no real passion there.  They don't have the passion.  Down the phone lines.  That's right.  Because then, you know, the next thing is they'll be calling saying, I'm fat.  Are they still on the air? 
[00:37:30]  They know damn well we're still on the air.  They listen every day.  Boo-boo.  That's funny, boo-boo.  Are we still on the air?  I don't know.  Why don't you read all the articles that are coming out about us?  Love you.  Love you, Ed.  We're mentioning every single satellite radio article.  Well, let's hear some more forced phony laughter.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who?  Technically.  No.  The skateboarders?  Skateboarders?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, because that's happening.  Skateboarders?  That's happening, Mike.  Satellite radio.  It's taking over terrestrial radio. 
[00:38:00]  Haven't you heard?  I know that they're...  Aren't you hiding under the desk like everybody?  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Look, I'll be completely honest.  They don't have to run away at this point in satellite radio.  This is the beginning of a new fledgling industry.  You know what I mean?  Doing very well.  Is terrestrial radio going to go away?  Absolutely not.  But to sit there and think it's not going to have an impact on your industry, that it might go away, 
[00:38:30]  that you shouldn't maybe be worried and change some tactics,  and, you know, as a radio company, you shouldn't acknowledge the fact that there is a new form of radio entertainment out there  that people are embracing, it's the head in the sand right there, the big fat head in the sand.  Just like Lil Rudy's crushed head was in the driveway, your head is buried in the sand.  Well, breath-wise, let's just say it's buried in the cat box. 
[00:39:00]  God, they have nothing.  I wouldn't mind even getting smashed, but is that the funniest you have?  Are they even on the air?  They're acting like no one's talking about us or satellite radio.  Are you kidding me?  You know, they're frauds, but could they at least be funny frauds?  I respect the fraud if there's at least something funny behind it.  And, you know, Howard Stern is a complete dick and an asshole,  but the truth of the matter is he's one of the most successful people that were ever in radio,  and where is he going? 
[00:39:30]  He's going to satellite radio, asshole.  You know, these are people that have such...  They don't have vision.  They can't see the future.  It's a typical, if man were meant to fly, he wouldn't have killed his dog in the driveway.  Or something like that.  I know it goes like that.  I'm not going to hurt you, honey.  I'm just going to bash your brains in.  I'm going to run him right the fuck over.  Come here, Rudy.  I love the little son of a bitch. 
[00:40:00]  And when do you think Rudy should go to the veterinarian?  As soon as possible.  As soon as possible.  Someone's run over Rudy.  And he's obsessed with the fact that we're skateboarders.  And we're not skateboarders.  Skateboarders?  The last time I was on a skateboard, I don't even remember.  I think Brickhouse was in the top ten. 
[00:40:30]  I don't remember.  Get it right.  Opie is the rollerblader and is the germaphobe.  I am the tranny hunter.  Get your fucking terminology straight, fat boy.  Tranny hunter.  I like that.  Fix you with a spear with a dildo on it.  Is it sexual or is it deadly?  No one knows.  Now they can come up with some accurate jokes about us.  Right.  Yeah.  You're a skateboarder.  I also enjoy video gaming.  That's a big part of my life.  Yeah.  Feel free to goof on that.  Yeah.  That would be nice.  All right.  Aren't you hiding under the desk like everybody else? 
[00:41:00]  I know when they first came there to offset the cost of getting them over there, they were  charging.  And then they went off of that when people weren't buying.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Will people get that straight?  How?  I don't understand something.  How could we be on the premium service when we first got here?  We're getting subscribers.  They're paying money to listen to us when we were just on the premium channel.  Can I stop you there really fast? 
[00:41:30]  I know.  But the reason we were on the premium channel was because the company, XM, unfortunately, was  really scared of us because of what happened.  That's the only reason.  Yeah.  And then they felt comfortable with us.  They realized that there weren't going to be all these crazy boycotts of people with  signs outside XM.  It turned out no one cared.  Yeah, perhaps it was because of the sex and St. Pat's thing, my friend.  So then they're like, all right, well, nothing crazy is going on.  Now we can take them off the premium and expose them to more people. 
[00:42:00]  That was the whole reason.  How could we be on the premium making money, whether we're getting a lot of subscribers or  not?  I'm not even going to argue that point with this idiot.  Whether or not we have huge amounts of subscribers or 10 subscribers, why would you then take  us off the premium and get that much less money?  Like, why take us off the premium and now you're getting nothing? 
[00:42:30]  We're still here.  They didn't fire us.  If we weren't doing well, I think the move would have been to fire us.  Which they could do.  Which they could do.  And not take us off premium.  How do you argue that we were failing on premium and they took us off?  Doesn't make sense.  Yeah, they're failing.  They're not getting as many subscribers.  So let's just blow off whatever money we are making from them.  The philosophy with the company is to expose us to a lot more people because Howard's moving 
[00:43:00]  a satellite.  There you go.  Counter that move.  There's a million moves that the two companies are doing.  In the shock jock genre, they want to expose us to as many people as possible before Howard  moves over a satellite.  Hey, and you could speculate as to why we were taking off a premium.  That's open for anyone's speculation.  We know the truth.  But there's no speculating needed as to why you were removed from Philly, from New York,  from Buffalo, and all the other markets that you failed in. 
[00:43:30]  Because you failed.  Because your ratings sucked ass and you were fired from those stations.  You were removed from those stations.  That's not open to speculation.  That's fact.  You stunk up the joint and they fired you.  That's it.  You could speculate all you want as to why we're not on premium anymore.  Go ahead.  We know why.  They had no competition in Philly.  None.  No one was there.  We handed them a fan base. 
[00:44:00]  They were handed our fan base.  Which they just lost immediately.  And it wasn't like they had you guys tossed off the air so the fans would hate them.  Everyone knew that you fucked up.  It wasn't like Don and Mike had you thrown off so the fans rebelled.  Right.  The fans wanted something to listen to.  And you guys were there alone and naked and you bombed.  You fucking bombed in one of the biggest radio markets in the country.  And you bombed in the biggest radio market in the country.  You stink.  If your show was an SUV, let's say, and our audience was a little puppy dog. 
[00:44:30]  Well, I think you get it.  Off of that when people weren't buying.  Yeah.  Don't know.  All I know is that we get some email at our website from that incredible army.  Yeah.  Good.  Keep writing.  Keep calling.  Keep calling.  My dog's still dead.  I still ran over the dog.  Keep calling.  Maybe next time it'll be one of you.  And I don't mean maybe you'll run over your dogs.  I mean maybe I'll run over one of you. 
[00:45:00]  Oh.  He's a little angry.  Yeah.  Oh, he's a little angry.  A little angry.  Who are you really angry at, Don?  I would say, Don.  I would say, Don's angry at Don for failing miserably across the country and killing the  only thing your wife fucking loved, shithead.  Your little dog.  That was it.  That must be a treat coming home.  The old puppy killer coming home every day.  Having to stare his wife in the face. 
[00:45:30]  And she looks at you and just, no matter how hard she tries on a daily basis when she  looks at you, trying to remember something, something fun, something loving, she just  sees the guy that killed her fucking dog.  She sees her little Rudy killer.  So I think he's angry at Don.  I think Don wants to run over Don.  And it would be great if it would be the same way as it was with my dog. 
[00:46:00]  Well, they're probably eating like dogs.  Hello, Don and Mike.  What?  Wow.  Yeah, sorry to bother you, but Buzz is the only one who has to worry about the end of  the world.  Why?  Why is that?  Topeka, Kansas.  Zip code 666.  Well, I'm actually not from Topeka, but that's...  And haven't we already stated that 666 is not...  Even their listeners are bores.  That was their idea of a funny call. 
[00:46:30]  Dude, I mean, how could you listen to a radio show where they feature their wives on their  website?  On their website.  The wives!  The wives!  Say, with pictures, here are the wives!  Play along at home!  There you go.  Oh my God.  Who is that?  Just stop it.  Who is that?  Just stop it.  Who is that?  Can I see...  Who's married to a guy?  Let me see...  Can I see that?  Oh God.  Who is married to a guy?  It's Dr. Smith with a Dutch boy wig on.  Who's the tranny?  I like that.  It's fucking Dr. Zachary Smith with a Dutch boy wig. 
[00:47:00]  That's a pretty cool vest in 1984.  Nice.  Wait a minute.  That's a joke, right?  Someone's married to that?  Yeah.  We can see why, you know, she's married to whatever, because, you know, she's looking  for money, but that?  Wow.  Oh boy.  Who's married to fucking...  That looks like Eric. 
[00:47:30]  Eric, who's married to you?  It's a fucking mullet.  We better not mess with this show anymore, because I think that one guy's wife could  beat us up, man.  Holy crap.  Whose wife is that?  You know, I hate when I start feeling bad for people, but someone's got to go home to  that.  How can we abuse them on the air?  When all is said and done, after four hours of being away from that, he's got to go back  home to it.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I apologize for everything I said. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  You're in your own fucking hell.  Did you hear the show, honey?  And are you out of oats?  I don't know.  These radio guys don't get it.  Wow.  Your listeners don't want to see the pictures of your wife.  No, but unless you're Joel Steinberg hosting a radio show.  I want to see some head of pictures.  Then we'd love to see some family shots.  A little radiator.  Oh.  Nobody wants to see you abroad, stupid.  Nobody.  Wow.  Honey, I'm home. 
[00:48:30]  Every time somebody says, Fran Bruja, his wife yells.  That, wow.  That was amazing.  She can only come if he fucks her to the Budweiser jingle.  She's truly awful.  But make fun of us because we're skateboarders.  What?  Skateboarders on satellite radio.  All right.  Well, yeah, don't hide under the desks just yet. 
[00:49:00]  But I would take notice.  I'll tell you that much.  Everyone else is taking notice.  I would definitely take notice.  Don't be stupid.  As you're just getting canned from market after market, I would take notice.  Why do you think the ratings are going down on radio in general?  Why do you think that is?  Do you think it's because maybe your freedom to really discuss things openly has been taken away? 
[00:49:30]  That the threat is looming every day that you might say something or do something that gets you fired?  That the language you have to use now makes it incapable to convey ideas back and forth like human beings?  Hmm.  Where can people do that?  Oh, yeah.  Satellite radio.  That's right.  Just like when you used to watch movies on Channel 5 or something.  And then you got cable television.  It's like, well, I don't think some of the networks or the local affiliates were  hiding under the desk. 
[00:50:00]  But I'll tell you what.  I'd rather watch a movie on HBO or Showtime these days than on Channel 5 or one of the commercial channels.  Same thing.  Dumbass.  It's happening.  It's here.  It's not going away.  It's doing nothing but getting stronger and growing.  And, yeah, don't hide under the desk.  Keep your head right where we can see it as it gets lopped off or crushed under a tire like  Lil Rudy. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, people want to...  Is that Rudy?  Yeah.  Oh, can we see a picture of the little fella?  What a cute little guy.  Any pictures after?  Was he a little Yorkie or something?  Jesus.  What a cute dog.  That must have been devastating.  Is that White Furhawk?  Yeah.  Wow, that must have...  Blood must have caked in there nice.  That must have bloodied up real nice, man.  I wonder if the intestines shot out the asshole and you had to put them all over the passenger  seat.  You fucking fat murderer.  Just rove him to the vet.  You are now a murderer.  I think Rudy needs to be corrected. 
[00:51:00]  A naughty little dog, if I may be so bold.  He is a willful dog.  Veterinarian.  He could use a tire over his head.  Perhaps a bit more.  Little Rudy.  We're going to play a little something as we go to break.  People are requesting this, Anthony? 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  I don't want to give it away because it gives away the punchline.  Oh, right.  But I want to play the thing that inspired this.  Oh, I haven't heard that in a while.  So you want to do both of them?  Yeah.  All right, so we'll do the first dang and then the second dang.  All right.  It makes sense to us, so just bear with us.  A little elephant they almost brought up.  We'll start with this first.  Go.  Today I saw a big hug come poking me in the head.  Mommy's still having sex, the slut.  I hear the sound of a vacuum cleaner.  Mommy must be cleaning the rug.  Wait a minute.  It's headed this away. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  My little elephant.  Which one is this?  Will you stop the fucking thing, Eric?  No, what's the matter?  Stop the thing, Eric.  Hawk, hit stop.  Ah, well, there you go.  Who fucked that up?  Who is it?  Raise their hand.  I don't know.  It's mislabeled.  What do you mean it's mislabeled?  Eric's pointing it at Eric.  It probably doesn't mean it.  It's his diary of stuff.  Ah, shut the fuck up, Eric.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  We still want to play it.  That's right, Hawk.  Oh, my God.  Oh, holy shit. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, boy.  I'm having an aneurysm.  Now you've done it.  Oh, my God.  And then he's like, then he decides he's going to say what it is.  No one heard it.  Which gives away the whole bit.  Do we have another version?  That's all I need to know right now.  We're live in the air here.  Not in here.  Not in here.  Well, where is it?  Not in here.  Well, where do you think it is?  All right, go get it, please.  When do you think maybe we should take Danny to the list?  Oh, God.  I don't even know what that was.  What was that?  I don't think we ever played that. 
[00:53:00]  No.  Sounded like a parody.  Probably a parody of the original.  Yeah.  Frank of the Poconos.  What's up, Frank?  Yeah, I just wanted to chime in on what you guys were saying earlier about the FM radio DJs  making, like, XM's nothing to be worried about.  Yeah.  We were talking about yesterday that jack.  What do you think that jack format's all about?  That's obviously, like, a blatant attempt to, you know, reach a broader audience as far  as, you know, different types and genres of music.  You're right.  It's pretty much the only thing commercial radio can do that can mimic satellite radio. 
[00:53:30]  That format is based on satellite radio or an iPod.  And iPods.  Yeah, something like that.  iPods and satellite radio have a huge buzz right now, so that's what commercial radio  is going to do, is try to bring those two things together.  It's about that variety.  Throw it on commercial radio.  What you want to hear, no jocks, things like that.  I heard Jack yesterday, actually, in a restaurant.  That was the, I think it was actually one-on-one.  Yeah.  You know, playing some weird thing, and they say, you know, like, something like Jack. 
[00:54:00]  I'm like, that's the only one here.  It wasn't right, but it was all commercials.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, so many commercials.  And that's the thing they can't get away from, because it's, you know, commercial radio.  And they play so many goddamn commercials.  I also was relating to what Opie was saying.  A buddy of mine, unfortunately, got serious.  And he's got this fucking suction cup that literally takes up his entire passenger's windshield.  Yeah.  And he's got, and he says, I says, I have XM.  He says, well, how did you install it, and blah, blah, blah. 
[00:54:30]  He says, well, I have a sunroof, and I've got to put all my wire.  He's got, like, wires, like, sticking through his sunroof.  And now he, like, can't close it all the way.  Like, every time it rains, he's getting wet.  And it's awful.  Awful.  You know, we like having fun with it, the whole size of the units and how bad they are  and how they overheat and stuff.  But the plain and simple fact is XM is so far ahead of him as far as the technology goes.  It's ridiculous.  It's, you know, where they have the huge units and the heat that comes off of these things 
[00:55:00]  are ridiculous.  And the wires you've got to hook up.  And with XM, you know, you're popping the thing right on your dash.  It's small with the transmitter right to your radio.  Leaps and bounds ahead in technology.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, guys.  Brunch it out.  Bye, mister.  We're stalling, but I don't know.  Don't hide under the desk, though.  I don't think it's going to happen.  It's funny, too, because I'm doing this DC gig, and I know my ads won't get played on JFK, 
[00:55:30]  and I can certainly understand why.  But it was funny.  I was talking to somebody, and they go, look, they can't.  Somebody over there said, look, we can't play his ads.  He called Don's wife a C.  I did, and she is.  That might be a problem.  It's not a big deal.  So I understand.  He's got to stop listening to his wife and just do his radio show.  I guarantee she has a huge influence on the dumb radio show.  Of course.  She tells him what was wrong with it.  Well, I didn't understand why you stayed with that for so long. 
[00:56:00]  When you start posting pictures of your wife and wives on your website, the show is done.  They only did it because he did it, and she pushed for it.  We all love women on this show, but you're not going to see pictures of our women on a website.  Yeah.  It's two different lives.  Oh, the wives.  The wives of the show.  The wives.  Like, oh, I want to see the wives.  They're always talking about it.  Let's punch them up and see what they look like.  I want to put a, you know, a face with a voice. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, look at that.  And when your wife looks more manly than you, you shouldn't post her picture, you idiot.  Superimpose someone else's head and just deal with the consequences at home.  She went to a mall to that place to get all dollied up.  What's the name of it?  The beauty shots?  The glamour shots.  Glamour shots.  Where they smear the Vaseline on the lens?  It looks like she went to glamour shots.  Yeah.  And that's what they thought would help her out.  The wives.  The wives.  Hey, hey.  How awful is that?  Pat from Munaki wants to know, did Frida climb over the hood like Jackie O to scoop up Rudy's brains? 
[00:57:00]  Pat's on fire today.  Very funny, Pat.  Yeah.  All right.  I think we're ready to finally take a break, Anthony.  Yeah, why would she climb on the hood?  There was no hoodlum.  Liddy.  That's awful, Liddy.  All right, Anthony, so we'll play this first, and then we'll play the other thing about the dog.  The thing?  Yeah.  All right.  But it starts with this. 
[00:57:30]  This thing.  This inspired the thing you're going to hear.  Okay.  October 2nd, today, my life began.  My parents do not know it yet.  I am as small as the pollen of a flower, but it is I already.  I will be a boy.  I will have blonde hair and blue eyes.  Nearly everything is settled already.  October 19th, I have grown a little, but I am still too small to do anything by myself. 
[00:58:00]  My mother does everything for me, although she still does not know that she is carrying me under her heart.  But I am a real person, just as a crumb of bread is still real bread.  My mother exists, and I do too.  October 23rd, my mouth is just now beginning to open.  Just think, in a year or so, I'll be laughing, or later I'll start to talk.  My first word will be, Mama. 
[00:58:30]  October 25th, today my heart began to beat.  It will beat softly for the rest of my life, never stopping.  After many years, that will tire and stop, then I shall die.  November 2nd, I am growing continually.  My arms and legs are taking shape, but I must wait a long time before these tiny legs will raise me to my mother's arms.  November 12th, tiny fingers are beginning to form on my hands. 
[00:59:00]  How small they are.  One day I'll stroke my mother's hair and tell her how nice she is.  November 28th, only today the doctor told my mother that I'm living here under her heart.  How happy she must be.  Are you happy, Mother?  November 25th, today is Thanksgiving.  My mother and father are probably thinking about a name for me.  And they don't even know that I am a little boy.  So they are probably calling me Barbara. 
[00:59:30]  But I want to be called Andy.  I am growing so big.  December 10th, my hair is growing.  It is as bright and shiny as the sun.  I wonder what kind of hair my mother has.  December 13th, my eyes are almost fully developed, although the lids are still shut.  When mother brings me into the world, it will be full of sunshine and overflowing with flowers.  December 24th, I have never seen a flower, you know, but more than anything, I want to see my mommy. 
[01:00:00]  How do you look, mommy?  December 24th, I wonder if my mother hears the delicate beat of my heart.  Some children are born with sickly hearts, and then the gentle fingers of a doctor performs miracles to make them healthy.  But my heart is healthy.  It beats so evenly.  Tup, tup, tup, tup.  You shall have a healthy son, Mother.  December 28th, today, my mother shall be. 
[01:00:30]  Why did you kill me, mommy, when God made me special for you?  I really wanted to see you and put my little arms around you? 
[01:01:00]  Why did you kill me, mommy?  Quiet.  Because I thought you really killed for me. 
[01:01:30]  Stop it!  And I wonder what I would have grown up to be.  I guess I'll never know.  Because mommy, you killed me. 
[01:02:00]  That's just the best.  Wow.  Why did you kill me?  Yeah, it takes a while to get there, but man, what a payoff.  What a payoff.  What a goddamn payoff.  You are right, Anthony.  Dan-an-an.  Well, that inspired this little thing from one of our listeners as we go to break.  August 2002.  I'm a cute little puppy in a pet store on the Upper East Side of New York. 
[01:02:30]  I'm a Cairn Terrier, and boy, am I cute.  September 2002.  I can't wait for a family to take me home.  Look at this lady.  I hope it's not her.  She looks like a real twat.  Christmas 2002.  That fucking twat brought me home, and it sucks here.  I keep hearing two words.  Career and failure.  February 2003.  It's Valentine's Day, and the fat fuck named Mike still hasn't brushed his teeth. 
[01:03:00]  I think I'll shit on his pillow.  September 2003.  I hate it here.  I've been here for seven dog years.  Nothing works here.  The mouthwash doesn't work.  Thanksgiving 2003.  I'd rather lick my ass than kiss Mike.  Did I mention they named me Rudy after the mayor of New York?  These people are dumber than the ball I chase.  March 2004.  That cunt had my ball sack cut off. 
[01:03:30]  October 2004.  I despise these freaks.  I just ass-fucked clink.  That'll teach them to eat my kibble.  February 2005.  I'm running away.  They'll never find me, and I'll be happy with a family that doesn't suck ass.  March 2005.  You killed me.  You ran me over because you were late for work. 
[01:04:00]  You'll burn in hell.  I trust in you, you fat fuck.  Get some-fucked clink, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me.  I needed a head, needed a drawing, he made me, he made me, he made me, he made me, he made me, he made me.  Well, then woo then.  Yeah.  Which-what?  Why?  Where?  Schork what?  What?  Who?  Well, why?  We have problems.  Shakin' uh, sh-sh-shakin' uh, shakin' uh. 
[01:04:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:05:00]  What was that?  I was leaning against this window thing, and my chair hooked into the bottom ledge of the thing that holds the shade.  Oh, all right.  And I have screws in that thing?  Apparently not.  It's like the second piece of metal that's fallen off of this thing.  All right.  Still to come on the program, we're going to talk to Brian Hurta.  I didn't mean it, Ben.  He's an Indy racer.  I didn't mean it.  He drives the XM car, right?  Yeah.  What did he...  Did he come in third?  Third.  Third, the Indy 500? 
[01:05:30]  What's wrong with old knee back?  Oh, my God.  What the hell is this?  Yeah, this is the story on Good Morning America.  Just take the hangar out of your shirt, lady.  It's some girl that reconnected the straight portions artificially, surrounding them with titanium mesh and adding to...  What?  ...in her spine.  What happened, Anthony?  Well, she's born bent over.  She's just like at a 90-degree bend when she walks because her spine was all screwy in her lower back. 
[01:06:00]  And they actually had to take out part of her spine and replace it with titanium.  All right.  I got to be...  That's quite the operation.  I got to be...  When your spinal cord's running through it.  I was going to say, I got to be a dummy.  Wouldn't that paralyze you in some fashion?  You would think, but I guess they're very careful when they take the bone out and put the titanium in.  They take the bone out and keep the electric circuits still in there?  Yeah, yeah.  They're all connected.  He did it, this guy. 
[01:06:30]  And then they put...  Because they showed where they actually have like a six-inch section of the spine that they removed.  And then they filled it in with titanium.  Look at it.  Oh, my God.  Was she bent over.  It looks like a knee.  Her back was a knee.  Was a knee.  Yeah.  And she would walk around.  Yeah.  Hunched over.  Yeah.  Looks like Groucho.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Give her a cigar into my mouth.  Hello, I must be leaving.  I'm only five and I'm always bent over.  Well, that's right.  Chew a pickle, stupid. 
[01:07:00]  A medical miracle.  Well, it looks like I'm fucking you in the ass again.  Team girl standing tall.  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Jesus.  Oh, there you go.  That's a very rare condition called I look ridiculous-itis.  We always get the hate mail, but the reality is, if you're going to throw this stuff on TV,  you've got to make fun of it.  That's why they're putting it on TV.  This isn't to teach anyone anything. 
[01:07:30]  It's the freak show.  That's right.  People love parading freaks on television.  It's no different than the sideshows at the circuses that they took away from us.  Now they just throw it on TV.  They throw a little news around it and a little passion and a host that makes believe she cares,  and then it's okay.  That's right.  Tomorrow, they don't care about bent-over girl.  They're on to the next thing.  Give her an ace bandage for her back.  Oh, my God.  Look at the picture of her without her shirt on.  Nice.  They're covering her little boobies, though.  Unfortunately. 
[01:08:00]  Why is she pulling pants up so high?  Yeah, come on.  Pull them down.  She's sexy, for Christ's sake.  They're showing pictures of her, you know, those medical pictures that are so sexy when  they're naked.  I remember looking in a medical book when I was a kid.  Are you always looking for jacket material?  And I jacked to some naked woman with the black strip over her eyes, so you can't tell  who she is, with, I think, severe psoriasis, but she was completely naked, and that's all  that I needed thumbing through. 
[01:08:30]  And she was the best thing in the book.  Like, there were other nude women, but I couldn't bring myself to, you know, jerk off to a woman  with the gout or something.  What, Jimmy?  They're re-showing the same three pictures over and over and over.  And the girl just doesn't want to be there, you can tell.  She's got cushy boobies.  Yeah, but she has a little mole between her nose and lip, which is bugging her more than  that stupid knee in her back.  You know who she looks like?  Remember the mechanic kid driver that Bonnie and Clyde picked up in the Bonnie and Clyde 
[01:09:00]  movie?  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Jesus, Anthony.  No.  I'm just going back to 1968.  She looks like the gaffer on Citizen Kane.  Stop making us look like we have the memory of a gnat.  He was also in an episode of Star Trek.  The one with the grups.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course I remember, Anthony.  Of course.  Someone will know his name.  I guarantee it.  Yeah, well, when you're broadcasting to close to a million people, at least one out there  would know him.  All right, it's a little obscure, I understand, but it's not like Bonnie and Clyde is a movie 
[01:09:30]  no one's seen.  I can barely tell you the names of the leads in that movie.  Warren Beatty and...  And what's her name?  From Mommy Dearest.  Oh, yeah.  Joan Crawford.  No.  Joan Crawford was in that?  No, she was married to Jay Giles.  Ben is screaming.  Ben is screaming from the office. 
[01:10:00]  Here we go.  Oh, it was 1967.  Faye Dunaway.  Faye Dunaway, that's right.  She was married to Jay Giles?  Yeah, she was married to Jay Giles for a while.  That's something I know.  I know some things.  I know that.  And his name is Michael J. Pollard.  And he was in House of a Thousand Corpses recently.  Wait, the guy who sang Centerfold was banging Faye Dunaway?  No.  Oh, Michael J. Pollard.  You said Jay Giles.  Yeah, there's a whole thing going on where no one's listening.  I had a conversation with Jimmy.  You were having a conversation with me. 
[01:10:30]  No, I was looking, and I think you and Jimmy were having a conversation.  No, you did say Jay Giles.  I did know you said Jay Giles.  You said Jay Giles?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually, Peter Wolfe.  Yeah.  She was married to Peter Wolfe for a while.  Ben backed me up on this.  I believe it.  And he wrote Love Stinks about her.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a picture of him recently.  Yeah, you did.  His hair was really dark.  All right.  Very good, Anthony.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Philly.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, that bent over woman. 
[01:11:00]  She's just a natural chain of evolution.  That's just the way all women are going to be born here.  That's just the first step.  So you've got to make sure that you procreate with her.  And you know what's funny?  They had that weird thing they had to remove from her hand.  Turns out it was a plunger.  They're going to be born with little brooms attached to their fingers.  Wee-doo, wee-doo, wee-doo.  Instead of fingers, little wispy dust sweepers.  All right.  Well, we've got lots to do today here, guys.  Ooh.  On the cover of the New York Post, Brad and Angelina in bed. 
[01:11:30]  Photo exclusive, Anthony.  Ooh.  They finally got a picture of them in bed from a movie.  Yeah.  I'm sure it is.  Of course it is.  Yeah, that's the...  That's always the way...  That's the oldest gag in the book.  The whole thing's a promo for that dumb film.  Yeah.  Mr. and Mrs. Smith, who gives a shit?  It's probably awful.  Of course it is.  Like, these people are...  The news agencies feel like they're getting this coup when they talk to them.  And I was listening to Wins on the way in, the news station.  And they were so excited that they had this interview with Brad Pitt. 
[01:12:00]  And they're like, we even asked him about Angelina Jolie.  Like, he's not going to talk about her.  Because they did a movie.  And they want the movie to do well.  And they want some buzz with the movie.  That's the only reason.  Can you imagine being so cool like Brad Pitt, where you're banging Jennifer Aniston.  Yeah.  You blow her off for Angelina Jolie.  Uh-huh.  And you don't even tell anyone.  Yeah.  You don't even have to tell anyone.  Well, you're cheating, is what he was doing.  You don't usually...  Yeah, but now it's over.  Blurred it out. 
[01:12:30]  Now he can openly admit it, right?  Or they're still going through divorce stuff, and that's why maybe he's not talking.  Maybe.  Pending litigation.  Well, like we said yesterday, man.  Ticket tape parade.  Yeah.  In the canyons...  Canyon of heroes.  Canyon of heroes here in New York.  What kind of parade?  I said canyon.  No, what kind of parade?  Uh...  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Ticker tape?  Uh-oh.  Okay.  It's a ticket...  Ticker...  What?  Did you say ticket tape?  Yeah, he did.  Did I say ticket tape the first time?  Yesterday, too.  Ticket tape. 
[01:13:00]  Well...  Ticket tape?  Yeah.  Oh, violations.  Parking.  Parking near a hydrant.  Speeding.  Celebrating the meter maid.  We would announce that to the world if that happened to us.  Yes, I am fucking her.  Some scotch and duct and masking tape comes...  All right.  Ticket?  It's a ticket tape parade.  Ticker.  Ticker.  So there's tickets and tape.  Oh, now it's tickers.  I'm going quite a long way for this one.  So instead, it's clocks and hearts. 
[01:13:30]  Hey, on instant feedback, Eric, if you could get a rage from Whackbag.  He said, if you loved Diary of an Unborn Child, you'll love Story of an Alcoholic Father by  the Same Twisted Fuck.  And then there's a link to an MP3, perhaps you should get that immediately.  Chop, chop.  Chop, chop.  Hawk.  Post-haste.  All right.  So what was Brad Pitt saying in this interview on the way in then?  That he gave up no details about any romance or anything. 
[01:14:00]  And you've got to figure, the guy is going through a divorce.  So, you know, you can't be saying anything that can be used in court.  You know what I mean?  Believe me, I blurted out the words, sorry, pending litigation many times during my case.  I wasn't allowed to bring up much of anything.  You know, anything finances, sexual, where you're spending your money, what you're doing.  You've got to sound like you're destitute and not fucking anything. 
[01:14:30]  You know what, though?  When the details finally came out about you, though, you were everyone's hero.  Well.  You were everyone's hero.  What can I say?  What can I say?  It was, well, what can I say?  You know, I'm a radio star.  How to live the life.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, that was, uh.  Yeah, that was, that was, you know, hey, let's settle this.  All kinds of things come up in the courtroom.  And, uh, I'm sitting in the courtroom, and stupid Dominic Barber is my wife's attorney.  And he starts questioning me.  And, of course, the first question was, we've heard this before.  When was your anniversary?  When were you married?  And I didn't know the date.  I said, I don't remember.  Which really made me look good.  And the Post and the Daily News reporters are in the gallery there.  And they're writing things down. 
[01:15:30]  Like, oh, he didn't remember this.  And then they started bringing up some sex stuff.  As soon as they said that, they ran to the pay phones to get there.  Oh, yeah.  Stop the presses.  Stop the presses.  And then they bring up sex stuff.  And it's like, oh, boy.  All right.  Let's settle.  I'm done.  Hit the back room, and I'll break up my checkbook.  And you know Dominic Barber called the Post and the Daily News and told them to be there.  Because he knows that when the questioning got a little hot and heavy, I would cave. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  That's exactly what happens.  Anthony, in my hands, the latest press release from XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, oh, oh.  Making Don and Mike look stupid again.  Yeah, no one's talking about us.  No one even knows we're still doing radio.  That's cute, Don.  Very cute.  First, Audible Inc., which sells downloadable audio versions of books and newspapers and  satellite radio service provider, XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc., on Tuesday, said that 
[01:16:30]  in 2006, they will co-launch a new handheld device that can play both the XM service and  Audible's audio content.  The portable handheld satellite radio devices will be able to receive both XM's roughly 150  digital radio channels, as well as audio programs from broadcasters and audio book, newspaper,  and magazine publishers, which can be downloaded from the Internet.  So it is going to be another device that they're coming up with.  So you listen to XM, you listen in, and then you go, hey, I need some headlines. 
[01:17:00]  And you can download a newspaper into it.  Yeah.  And then you can read it right on the device.  And books.  If you want to, you know, read the DaVinci Code without doing all the work, you download  it to your stupid, this new device that's going to be announced, I guess.  And there you have it.  The value of the agreement was not disclosed.  XM and Audible said they will prominently co-market each other's services.  Here's where it's good news for you and I and Jimmy.  XM said it will feature Audible on the air, its website, and other channels, and also make 
[01:17:30]  the company's spoken word programming available for downloading on the XM website.  Audible said it will offer popular XM talk programs on its own website, starting with  the Bob Edwards Show and Opie and Anthony.  Hey, how about that?  The virus continues to spread slowly but surely.  Wow, Audible shares closed Monday at $16.33 on NASDAQ and climbed $1.17, 7.2%. 
[01:18:00]  To $17.50 in pre-market activity.  Nice.  The XM satellite shares closed Monday at $33.48.  $33.48.  Hey, where's the Doggy Company stock?  I understand that they're going to be putting out these new cassettes that they're going  to mail out with political flyers.  Cassettes.  Classic. 
[01:18:30]  Remember getting the cassettes in the mail?  It's like a whole book or series.  Oh, yeah.  And you come in this huge thing, and there's like 20 cassettes in there.  Right.  How to quit smoking or something.  There it is.  Four cassettes.  Yeah, a series is going to do that with the NFL games they have, and they're just going  to be like, don't watch this week, and you'll get the cassettes in a few days.  You can listen to the game at home.  Classic.  Just awful.  The Alcoholic Father.  It's 14 minutes long.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  That's classic.  Alcoholic Father audio is 14 minutes long. 
[01:19:00]  I guess we'll have to work on that.  Well, someone listen to it.  Yeah, give it a listen.  If it's worth the old tool on it, we'll have fun with that.  Let's see.  Pre-market activity, XM up 41 cents, 1.2%, 33.48 in pre-market activity.  That's pretty good.  Pre-market, let's see, serious.  Oh, down.  No.  Down 4 cents in pre-market.  $5.89.  That's a good buy, though, I guess.  Weren't they up to 9-something?  That was a good.  Oh, who got in at 9?  I did.  Who got in at 9? 
[01:19:30]  You did.  I bought 32 shares.  32 shares at 9 bucks a pop.  I would leave in mail messages every day.  I got some things I want to talk about as a shareholder.  I'm a shareholder in this company, and I got something to say.  Mr. K?  So this is kind of like moving into kind of iPod territory, isn't it?  Where you're downloading stuff even further than iPod.  This is like...  Like, I'm trying to understand this completely, Anthony. 
[01:20:00]  Handheld web access.  So you go to Audible's website, and you'll download the magazines and books and newspapers right into this device that's yet to be named.  And also you can download our program and Bob Edwards and also get the music channels, right?  I like this.  It's less carry-on.  Less carry-on.  A lot of people take your carry-on on the plane and stuff, and what do you got?  You got your bag with the Walkman in it or whatever Walkman. 
[01:20:30]  Listen to me.  Like, iPod, a book, things like that.  All your entertainment things, DVDs, stuff like that.  It's getting to the point where you're just going to have one device that takes care of everything.  Your phone calls, you watch movies on it, you download books, you listen to satellite radio.  Just one device.  It's getting there.  Once the screens are foldable and rollable for real, like, once you can get a really great laptop screen that's rollable, everything is going to change.  What, in a little tube?  Yeah, they're already working on something like that. 
[01:21:00]  Why does it have to be a tube, though?  Or whatever it would be, however you'd make it very small.  I just like it kind of flat.  Something that fits in your pocket like a wallet.  Agreed.  Like a wallet.  Well, say it's a tube, but say it's the length of a pen or something.  That's how it will start.  It's still small enough to carry in a jacket pocket.  I mean, whatever they're going to do.  That's what it is.  Things have to get to the point where you can just carry them like they're nothing.  And they're definitely going in that direction.  Some of the phones that are coming out now, all the stuff that's on them, and they're getting smaller and smaller.  Now you can flip them open and text message. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, I saw that.  Really easily, you know, and it's not a big clunky item anymore.  Good stuff.  Because I have a pain in the eye.  My phone, I'm ready to throw it.  Ben text messages a lot, you know?  So he'll text me something, and it will take me ten minutes to write,  Okay, Ben, I have no clue.  I'm trying to, you know, because you've got to go with the numbers and, you know,  click on one three times, and that's a C, and it's a pain in the ass. 
[01:22:00]  I like having a keyboard.  I don't have a text message ever.  I don't know how to do it.  You don't?  Nah, man.  Whenever somebody texts me, it always comes up unknown.  Maybe I'm not connected to the web, right?  My stupid phone, I don't know how to do it.  It's not connected to the web.  Connected to the web.  Text messaging?  Oh, I don't know what to do.  Sprint.  Because you've got to sprint for service.  I wish Walsh was here so I could think of that joke and throw my scalding cocky on his arm.  Let's go to Louie in Jersey.  Louie!  Dude.  Yeah.  They had some guy screaming about stocks last night. 
[01:22:30]  I don't know what program it was.  It was the first time I ever seen it.  I think it's MS, I want to say MSNBC.  It's this new guy who does this stock show, and all he does is scream the whole show about stocks.  He takes phone calls.  He plays sound effects.  I think I saw that over the weekend.  Dude, everyone's seen it.  Okay.  You stop, and it's like, what is this guy?  I'm kind of getting interested in it.  I'll tell you what.  It made me think about taking $1,000 and putting it on the side and going over and start doing this shit.  Hey, the guy's a crack dealer is what he is. 
[01:23:00]  So he comes on with this Sirius versus XM, and he says that Sirius is kind of right there with XM.  They showed some graphs and shit, and then he says, well, but the big point is technology.  Technology, he says, technology is tops, and XM leads it by a long, long shot.  Yeah.  So they're doing good.  That guy is crazy.  I've watched his show.  He goes around like he's going to have a stroke at any minute.  He's yelling.  He's sweating. 
[01:23:30]  He's trying to hit his sound effects.  Sometimes they don't work.  He's taking calls, and he's just spouting off his opinions on stocks.  People call up and, you know, what do you think of GE?  GE, that's a blue-chip stock, and you can't lose with it.  I'm looking at the price.  It's a good buy right now.  Next.  Bam.  And the next call comes up.  He's screaming.  We've got to get audio of this guy.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there's the latest announcement from XM.  That sounds like a good one.  Mm-hmm.  That sounds like a good one. 
[01:24:00]  Tony in Jersey.  What's up, Tony?  Yes, I want to correct, Jimmy.  The doggie company is not going to send cassettes.  They're going to send A-tracks out.  My name is Jose Jimenez.  Connor?  Yeah, this is Connor.  Hey, Connor.  Hi, Connor.  Hi there.  What a good name.  I think that guy you're talking about's name is Kudlow.  No, Kramer from Kudlow and Kramer Show.  It is Kramer.  That's his name.  That's your man. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  All right.  CNBC, right?  Mad Money, it's called?  Mad Money.  He's got the new hot stock show.  Is it entertaining?  Yeah.  Like, I'm not sure yet if it's entertaining.  I watched it for a while, but I'm not sure if I was entertained or really annoyed.  He's loud, obnoxious.  Well, for stocks to be watchable, let's be honest.  Exactly.  At least you're going to have a chick just blowing a guy while he talks about stock.  You've got to do something interesting.  You've got to do something.  Right.  All right.  So, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Picture of them in bed, but it turns out it's just a picture from their stupid movie.  Yeah.  Photo exclusive.  The post is going with that as their front page today, Anthony.  Yeah.  That's their big news.  And then the Daily News going with Jerkis Maximus.  Wow.  Jerkis Maximus.  I can't get enough of the front pages of the paper every day.  You just can't do anything in life.  No matter what you do and succeed in, if you make the news in any kind of a bad light,  they will twist it around. 
[01:25:30]  The guy who was in a great movie, Gladiator, and now it's just twisted around to Jerkis Maximus.  Well, he takes his phone and he acts like the end of Midnight Cowboy.  He tries to shove it in Townie's mouth.  Please, sir.  You know what, though?  This is going to help his movie.  It's getting weird reviews at Cinderella, man.  Red likes some pretty bad ones.  Well, it's getting really bad reviews, but that one show that we used to respect, Ebert and Roper,  or Siskel and Ebert.  Oh, Siskel and... 
[01:26:00]  Well, Siskel's gone, so now it's...  Siskel has been dead for years.  So now they've messed up the name of the show.  Oh, now it's insert name here in Ebert.  Well, they should have just...  Couldn't head in Ebert.  They should have just continued calling it the Siskel and Ebert movie review show.  But now it's Ebert and Roper?  Old birdhouse skull in Ebert.  Didn't we once call him Old Tapioca Under the Hat in Ebert?  But, uh...  You know, I think he got the stomach stapling surgery.  That surgery's not for everyone. 
[01:26:30]  No.  That made him look ridiculous.  Some people are better off fat.  Jovial.  Yeah.  Yeah, some people can pull off the fatness, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Other people lose the weight.  And it's like, what are you doing?  Like, you look at a guy like Vincent Pastore, he looks good big.  Like, you know what I mean?  Big pussy.  Right.  He doesn't look like a big fatso.  He's just a big guy.  Yeah, he probably wouldn't look good if he lost a lot of weight.  That water buffalo head.  Who wants to see him slim?  Head's not going to shrink.  Anyway, um, the Ebert and Roper team. 
[01:27:00]  Ebert.  Ebert.  Ebert.  I don't know.  Ebert.  Tripper and Roper.  You put a P in there.  I put a...  You put a P.  Ebert.  Um, they gave the Cinderella Man two thumbs up.  Two thumbs way up.  Ooh.  I'm starting to not respect their reviews of movies, Anthony.  Because they're giving everything two thumbs up at this point.  Dude, I stopped respecting him, because Ebert's married to a black woman, so I heard he's  always been nicer to a black actor, which is fine.  Ooh.  But then this yutz comes out and says that, uh, what's his name, is the, uh, the greatest 
[01:27:30]  actor.  Morgan Freeman.  The greatest actor.  I think Denzel's a much better black actor, not just because my ex-girlfriend had him in  the car the other night and had some sort of an accident.  What?  I'll find out details.  Wait.  What?  She was hanging with Denzel.  I don't know.  Something happened.  Who?  My ex.  I can't say her name on the air, but my ex.  Your ex, the one that, uh, uh, borrowed 20 bucks from you?  Yeah!  And went to the crack dealer and got ripped off.  She was in an accident with him?  She's fine.  She's, no, no one was hurt.  Something to do with something, a really fancy car and Denzel in the car, and then some kind 
[01:28:00]  of a weird accident in front of Jeff Gordon.  She was driving.  Was she in the car?  She was driving it.  She was driving the car.  Yeah.  Denzel's in the car.  I believe so, yeah.  And they ran into who?  Uh, no, no, no.  I don't know what she had, because she called me yesterday looking for the West Side Highway,  because she's a psychopath, and she was trying to find the Opie and Anthony show on 202,  and she didn't know what channel it was on.  So she was like, she said the, uh, the, what does it call the, uh, OnStar Guidance, whatever,  what kind of guidance system she has was setting her in circles. 
[01:28:30]  Uh-huh.  But somebody tells me it wasn't the system.  The navigation.  Somebody tells me she was reading it wrong.  I'm like, did you bang Denzel?  And she's like, no.  I was like, no?  Why didn't you?  Oh.  Was there anything going on between her and Denzel?  To be honest with you, I don't know.  Why was she driving Denzel around?  I didn't get details.  I was walking into an elevator trying to get a chance to talk to her.  How do you just stop before you get into the elevator?  I was just like, whatever, man.  Are you insane?  I'll talk to her.  It's Denzel.  You don't get into the elevator.  That's her, dude.  There's nothing you were on your way to that was as important as that phone call. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, yeah, there was.  The internet and somebody calling with a pricing issue.  A young lady that I was corresponding with.  I love Denzel, but I'll just rent glory after I have fun with this hooker.  So, yeah, she called me.  I talked to her for a couple minutes, and she was looking for the...  And her phone was kind of shitty.  I'll talk to her later.  Yeah.  I told you.  She's fantastic.  She's the only ex-girlfriend that I'm friends with.  So it was just her and Denzel?  That, I don't know.  I think so, because it was a small luxury vehicle belonging to her ex. 
[01:29:30]  And how did Jeff Gordon end up in this story?  Don't know.  I have no idea.  Race car driver Jeff Gordon?  Yeah, and then I kind of crashed the car in front of Jeff Gordon.  I'm like, all right.  Is she psycho where she doesn't...  Maybe she's making things up?  No.  No, no.  She'll exaggerate something.  Like when she told me she was almost kidnapped in Jamaica recently, and it turns out, like,  you weren't...  What are you talking about?  Like, she just didn't like something the cabbie did.  She's like, she was going to kidnap us.  I'm like, no.  But she wouldn't come out and lie and say that she was with Denzel if she wasn't.  No.  She might have been exaggerating, and she was actually with Rodney Allen Rippey. 
[01:30:00]  Or some other Washington.  You've got to hang with this girl.  She is just nuts and has a story every time you see her.  Every time.  A lot of drama.  A lot of drama.  Oh.  The drama.  Fuck, man.  Yeah.  I don't like drama girls.  When you're dating someone, it's really tough.  But now that she's my friend, she was a realtor who got me my apartment.  I love her.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's, um...  Because I knew, as my ex-girlfriend, I knew that I would, as a friend, I would have 24-hour  access, and I trusted her.  She wouldn't lie to me, because I know her, you know, for a long time. 
[01:30:30]  Do you ever bang her anymore?  No.  We have nothing sexual anymore.  She's really hot.  Um, but I don't care about banging her.  Yeah.  And she doesn't care about banging me.  It's like, she moved on, I moved on, but, uh, I still dig her as a person.  That is so odd.  She tells me what an awful boyfriend I was, because I was...  Oh, and you don't come back and tell her that she's an awful girlfriend?  Because, well, she's had...  I was never abused, she's like, because I was always away and working.  She's like, you wouldn't even take nights off.  Well, I was like, yeah, we'd walk into a restaurant, and you would turn the forks upside down, 
[01:31:00]  because you think they're coming at your eyes, you fucking wacko.  Are you kidding me?  No!  No!  She turns the forks...  What a nut!  The forks have to be turned upside down, because it looks like they're coming right at  her eyes.  That is really weird, man.  And I remember Keith Robinson, I was telling that to him, like, yeah, she's the thing.  He's like, oh, man, she's nuts.  Of course.  The forks are coming at her eyes.  Isn't that great, Ant?  Yeah.  That is good, but always with the drama.  Always.  And yet, I still really have fun talking to her.  She's like one ex I really want to hang with, and I love listening to her. 
[01:31:30]  That is an interesting ex to have, then, if she's got stories with Denzel and Jeff Gordon.  It's just silly.  Calls you up.  Well, I mean, I'll let her tell the story someday, because I do want to bring her on the  air one day.  I don't care, because I won't mention the name of the boxer that she would have sex with who,  like, dildos in his ass.  I won't mention that.  I won't mention that at all.  Are you kidding?  No, sir.  A boxer?  Yep.  A very popular boxer?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know about that Olympic gold medalist.  I mean, I'm not sure.  It was all alleged.  I mean, who knows?  Maybe she'll tell the story someday. 
[01:32:00]  Likes to sing sometimes.  Possibly.  I don't know.  What?  Don't know anything about him.  That's all we could say.  I'm trying to think of who this is.  I don't know enough.  He's one of the biggest.  Really?  In recent years, sure.  In the last decade.  Yeah.  A little more than a decade, at this point.  Not Ali, of course.  No, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Him, you put a vibrating dildo up his ass, and he stands still.  It, like, it evens him out.  Hmm.  In the last ten years?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  She's interesting. 
[01:32:30]  Is it Evander?  No.  No, not that way, Claire.  I can't say it.  I don't know what they are.  Lightweight?  Black guy?  I don't think so, Spanish.  I'm not sure exactly what he was.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  I think I know now.  Yeah.  That's all I needed.  No, not him.  No, no.  Not him.  The other guy.  If he put a Felix Trinidad, I'll throw my coffee at him.  He put in Chavez.  Oh, Jesus.  It's not Chavez, no.  No.  No.  It's that other guy.  It's the one that the chicks dig. 
[01:33:00]  Right?  It's the pretty boy.  I don't even know.  Yeah.  What the hell?  It's all alleged.  Who knows?  It's all alleged.  All right.  We should just...  A little bag of things.  And now there's Denzel Washington's story and Jeff Gordon's.  It's all alleged stuff.  And I'd like to just sit her down one day and go, how did you wind up fucking me ever?  How did that happen?  Well, you're...  I'm a mess.  You're a famous guy.  I'm not a famous guy.  I'm a dick show goddess from Jersey.  No.  I mean, she's hung out with some pretty famous people that she hasn't banged.  And the fact that she was faithful to me for nine months or whatever it was that we dated, 
[01:33:30]  and I don't think she was banging other guys.  Really?  Because she could have if she wanted to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She easily could have.  I mean, there would be no reason...  You lived together?  No.  No, you didn't live together?  No, and she saw the dump I lived in in Jersey and still wanted to be my girlfriend and stay  over.  It was like, you know, she knew I was a mess, so...  She still do drugs?  I don't think so.  I mean, she was doing better.  I mean, I'm hoping she doesn't anymore, because she was quiet, but I don't think she is now.  I hope not.  She does good in the realty business?  Yeah.  Well, she's a fucking really smart, funny maniac. 
[01:34:00]  Like, it's so odd when you see some people that are, yeah, that are, you know, a certain  way, and they actually hold down a job and do well.  Well, she's...  Because this chick sounds like a fucking lunatic.  Oh, she's a loon.  She works for Montana Realty.  She's trying to get...  Montana Realty.  Montana Realty.  All right, let's get to the Angelina Jolie stuff.  So, they interviewed her on the Today Show, I guess. 
[01:34:30]  We have a little taste.  You have said, quote, to be intimate with a married man when my own father cheated on my  mother is not something I could forgive.  I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that.  I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.  What?  She is sexy.  Just listen to her talk.  She is a confident, sexy girl.  What did she say, though?  She wouldn't be attracted to a man that...  Who would cheat on his wife?  Who would cheat on his wife.  So, does that mean she's not attracted to Brad Pitt?  Is that what she said? 
[01:35:00]  Well, they're going to just speak around the issues.  Beat around the bush.  Beat around the bush.  Why not just say what's going on so nobody keeps putting a camera in your face?  It's not about that.  And you and I both know that I could make a thousand statements right now, and it doesn't  matter.  I'm more annoyed when I, because of all of it, I try to take my son in a carousel yesterday,  and we've got too many people flashing pictures for him to have a good time.  That bothers me.  But, you know, I don't read gossip.  It's never nice to be caught up in a whirlwind. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, my God.  That is such bullshit.  That is such bullshit.  She's annoyed.  She's not annoyed.  She's loving the attention.  They love it.  The reality is, if she wants to go to a carousel or a park with her kids, she could find  one, you know, where the paparazzi aren't there.  Close down the park?  Not even.  You just go kind of incognito.  Most of these people, you know, walk out of their hotel when they're in New York City,  because that's where the paparazzi are, waiting for you, and then they'll take the stroll,  and everyone just follows you.  You could set it up in such a way, you can get out of the hotel without anyone knowing. 
[01:36:00]  You think?  Her?  Definitely, man.  The paparazzi's looking for her these days.  I don't know.  Definitely.  What picture is that, Eric?  From Original Sin.  Who is that?  Angelina.  Angelina.  God damn, that's a hot picture.  Holy shit.  Can I see that, Hawk?  Yeah, take a look at that, Jimmy.  From Mr. Skin, once again, Mr. Skin coming through.  MrSkin.com is a godsend.  But that other movie where she's the heroin addict, that's where she was at her best, naked.  Gia.  Yeah, the stuff from Gia is just amazing. 
[01:36:30]  She's a great actress, too, man.  Absolutely amazing.  Poor Billy Bob.  The reality is that the reason they're not making any statements is because it's keeping  the attention going.  They've got a new movie coming out.  If all of a sudden she goes, you know what, this is bull, we never did anything, we're just  friends, then there's almost no sense.  It's very possible that they are just saying, let's hang out and get everybody talking.  I mean, that's also very, you know.  They do that all the time in Hollywood.  And the dummies, we're talking about it because it's news, but there are people that really  do a shit.  I wonder if they're doing it. 
[01:37:00]  Who cares?  Yes, I wonder.  Oh, well.  And Angelina and Brad are taking unprecedented measures to make sure it's not.  They sent out these agreements to journalists demanding no personal questions be asked during  today's press interviews.  Yeah, this is what we talked about yesterday.  They actually had a contract you had to sign if you want to interview one of these two.  And of course, these ball-less nobodies in the press would never sarcastically ask it  or find a way around it. 
[01:37:30]  You know, they're just such...  The more I hear about them photographing her and her kid, the happier I am about Arthur  Cheehan.  Bye-bye.  For Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Angelina's agreement sent by her lawyer even threatens legal action  if the terms are violated, saying Angelina will end the interview, leave the room, and keep  the tape.  But as for Ann Curry's interview, she says...  There were absolutely no restrictions on this interview.  Absolutely no restrictions.  I don't make deals before interviews about what I'm going to ask and what I'm not going  to ask.  And neither do we. 
[01:38:00]  So we have canceled our interviews with both stars.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  You're doing the right thing.  You have some dignity.  Holy mackerel.  Yeah.  We have canceled our interview.  They don't want to be interviewed because, like you said, they don't want the truth to  come out because the truth is probably boring.  Yeah.  Yeah, we just hang out and he touches my kid and wonders what nationality it is.  And neither one of us knows.  And then we don't fuck.  We touch this nationless boy. 
[01:38:30]  Which I adopted to look hip on Wilshire.  Or Wilshire, however you say it.  Wilshire.  Fucking Jersey Rube.  Jesus.  Go to Houston Street in the village.  Houston Street.  So there you have it.  That's the latest on Brad and Angelina.  Oh, thank God.  Ashley, Ashley.  I really wanted to know about that.  Yeah.  I'd love to be in that situation.  Is it true you left a log in the bowl that was sticking eight inches out of the water?  Ah, no comment.  What if they just defuse the situation? 
[01:39:00]  Like, why make a big thing with these contracts that the press has to sign that they're not  going to ask?  If they ask, just go, nah, nothing really going on.  Make it boring.  Because it's getting everyone talking.  Because now everyone's talking about the contract.  They just throw these little tidbits out there and the media grabs it and runs with it.  And everything's calculated.  And of course, you know, as they're doing their stories and their stuff, they mention  that they got a new movie coming out.  Everyone knows this movie's called Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  I would have never known.  Well, I know.  It is actually a good movie. 
[01:39:30]  And she said the hardest part about playing the role is learning to drive the minivan.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, brother.  All right.  We got other things here.  We got the third installment of Mayor Menino, Mispronouncing Stuff.  We like going down that road.  We have the Paul Anka yelling at his band that we've done.  Yeah.  We've isolated some of the better ones, Anthony.  And we also have Paul Anka's new CD. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  What's that about?  He's covering songs.  He's covering...  Like he does Bon Jovi, It's My Life, Spandau Ballet, True, Eye of the Tiger from Survivor.  Oh, I want to hear that.  Do you really?  Oh, of course.  Paul Anka doing Eye of the Tiger?  Everybody Hurts from R.E.M.  Wonderwall from Oasis, Black Hole Sun.  Goes on and on.  Jump from Van Halen.  And hello from Lionel Richie.  Smells like teen spirit? 
[01:40:30]  No way.  He did not.  You got to hear that one.  Yeah, we got to hear that.  Hey, listen.  If you put an Eye of the Tiger, I'm getting up in shadow boxing.  So you might want to play the other one.  Oh.  That gets me moving.  I'm sorry.  I want to see that.  I can't help it.  Just pumps me up for exercise.  This is a good contrast.  We got the clips of Paul Anka yelling and screaming at his band behind the scenes.  And then we have the song.  So here's Paul Anka.  You thought, you thought, you thought, you thought eight things tonight.  You're on fucking notice, John. 
[01:41:00]  I gave you a list.  You had half a list that I gave you.  We're choosing everything on it.  Okay?  The guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The guys get shirts.  Do you understand?  We're not going to be as strong as our weakest link.  The guys get shirts.  What's he going to be, guys? 
[01:41:30]  I went that distance.  Now I'm back on my feet.  Just a man with the will to survive.  Yeah.  And many times it happened too fast.  You change your passion for the glory.  That's when she came into my life.  Some broad opened the door and walked in.  She had a great pair of stems.  I took a shot of whiskey. 
[01:42:00]  This is awful music.  This is horrible.  You know, just write a new song because it doesn't even sound like Eye of the Tiger.  How do you make that song worse?  Yeah.  How?  That was...  Jesus.  That's like take the lyrics of a song and just write a new song around it and use someone  else's lyrics.  That's what that was.  What if Smells Like Teen Spirit? 
[01:42:30]  We've got to hear that.  Yeah, that I've got to hear.  God-awful.  All right, well, first we've got to hear a clip of him yelling at his band.  What's it going to be, guys?  Do you want fucking Vinnie Falcone in front?  Do you want me to go and get a conductor that'll sit and ride your asses?  Is that what you want?  Do you want your jokes?  What an ass.  I want Vinnie Falcone.  There is a lot of loose shit going on and I am telling you, you guys are thin ice.  All right?  I'm telling you right now.  It does sound like Ron F.  I sliced like a fucking hammer. 
[01:43:00]  You've seen it and I'll do it again.  When I tell you the band, you better look and make sure everybody's here when you want  to.  I will not put up with this shit.  You understand that?  That's just the fucking way it is.  Every one of your fucking checks.  Bring your friends.  It's fun to lose and to pretend.  She's overboard.  She's self-assured.  Oh my God.  This smells like teen spirit.  I have no idea.  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  It doesn't even...  No, I know a dirty word.  Hello, hello, hello, how low.  Hello, hello, hello, how low.  With the lights out, less dangerous, here we are now.  Entertain us, I feel stupid, contagious, here we are now. 
[01:44:00]  Entertain us, I'm a liar.  Oh, it's that horrid.  I gotta say, I like this better than the original.  Shut up.  You dick.  Let's go to Nathan in South Carolina.  Nathan.  Hey, what's going on?  Nate.  What's up?  I do best. 
[01:44:30]  It's horrible.  Yeah.  Is that what you wanted to say?  No, I wanted to say, maybe it'll blow his head off like Kirk and Spain did.  Some people have such good ideas when they call, and then they can't pull it off once they make the call.  Then they blow it.  Hello, hello, hello, how low.  Didn't Lounge Against the Machine already do this like five years ago? 
[01:45:00]  Good to see Mr. Anka has an original idea.  John from Ithaca.  Richard.  Richard Cheese.  Richard Cheese.  Sounds like Richard Cheese, actually.  Brother.  I invented this type of music, Robin.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Dick Cheese.  All right, well, you don't want to hear any more of this, do you?  What other songs do you do?  Those are great.  Spandau Ballet, True, Everybody Hurts, Jump, Hello from Lionel Richie, Eyes Without a Face, Billy Idol, Love Cats by The Cure, Tears in Heaven by Eric Clapton, The Way You Make Me Feel by Michael Jackson. 
[01:45:30]  Hollywood Nova from Wackbag bringing up that Pat Boone did Enter Sandman.  Remember that?  Did he really?  Yeah.  This has been done.  Well, Johnny Cash.  Johnny Cash made the songs cooler, though.  He actually made every song he did cooler.  It's amazing. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  All right.  You ever hear The Wall by Johnny Cash?  Oh.  It's not a cover.  It's one of his originals.  Yeah.  Download that.  The Wall.  Fucking unbelievable.  Okay, we're going to take a break.  On the way, we got Bin Laden's niece.  She's a guest.  Yeah.  Ben's got her booked.  No, just don't ask her about her uncle.  No, just don't contact her.  Imagine.  Yeah, I saw her on TV a couple of days ago. 
[01:46:30]  She's not too bad looking.  But there's this little hint of Osama Bin Laden in her face.  Like she's kind of good looking, but you could kind of see him in there, which would be a little distracting.  Why aren't we allowed to just kill her?  Well, it's quite guilt by association.  Well, you know, her uncle there killed a lot of our brothers and sisters and fathers and mothers.  We've all had uncles that have done things in life that perhaps we shouldn't pay for.  I'm sure George Bush's family wouldn't be bothered in the Middle East. 
[01:47:00]  They're fair-minded, good people.  Right.  Wouldn't be lopping their heads off.  Not at all.  Lovely religion.  That's how we are.  That's what separates us, Jimmy.  Right.  We're dumb.  We're stupid.  Oh, is this the over 40 cheerleaders?  No, it's not.  On ABC.  What are they trying to do?  Their morning show.  I think they're cheerleaders and they're over 40.  Yeah. 
[01:47:30]  Is this supposed to be funny?  Look at them.  See, so they're walking around in, like, bathrobes like they're just housewives in the morning.  And then they rip off the hat and robe and they become cheerleaders for, I think, some female basketball team.  Oh, wow.  We've got to dance the hot stuff.  Do you recognize the logo on the front as some sports team?  No.  I could care less. 
[01:48:00]  See you and...  Wait, she's turning around.  There's nothing hot about this.  And they're unique because they're over 40.  They've got baggy T-shirts on and awful, what, red-orange pants?  They've got the mom jeans on.  Hopefully they lose the pants, no?  No, I think this is all the skin you're going to get.  Yeah, this puts the other cheerleaders to shame.  They're wearing full long pants and T-shirts.  Baggy T-shirts. 
[01:48:30]  I want to hear the cheers.  Give me an H.  Give me a Y.  Give me an S.  Give me a T.  Give me an R.  What's it spelled?  The beginning of hysterectomy.  Hysterectomy?  Hysterectomy.  Is it H-E...  E...  No, H-Y.  H-Y.  S-T-E-R.  You said R.  S-T-E-R.  Yeah, you said S-T-R.  You sure?  I'm positive.  Play the tape back.  I'm pretty sure I said E-R.  No, you fucked up.  I certainly didn't. 
[01:49:00]  Hysterectomy.  I'm sorry, you'll have to get a hysterectomy.  But did you hear the way I bailed out?  I didn't feel like spelling out the entire word?  Of course, especially after leaving out a letter.  Did I leave out a letter?  I don't know.  We'll find out there in the replay.  Well, Nathaniel's only doing that because he hates me.  What are they for?  WNBA?  Oh, that figure.  Timeless torches.  Timeless torches?  Timeless torches.  Oh, God. 
[01:49:30]  What's the matter with flickering meatbags already taken?  You're not timeless torches.  John Bonet is a timeless torches.  Because you can still watch those hot little dance videos.  I'm not the one that threw her in a miniskirt and said, dance, bitch.  A little cowboy hat and six shooters.  Other than me.  I'm not responsible for that.  Yeah, believe me.  There weren't pedophiles all over the country jerking off to that footage on the evening news.  We can all enjoy the videotape.  That's right.  How old was she? 
[01:50:00]  She should have been playing with color form.  But instead, she's basically stripping so mommy can feel good about herself.  There you go.  Fucking creepy family.  They've moved on with their lives.  Where's Martini Steve?  Is this good?  We finally got the story of an alcoholic father.  Oh.  Let's get the fucking Our Gang shorts wearing psychopath in here.  It says, mostly very preachy and religious.  We're spanky.  And religious.  Our Gang.  Jesus.  Our Gang shorts.  Hey, Weezer. 
[01:50:30]  I like that.  You've got the biggest shorts ever.  Oh, Tay.  Oh, my God.  That's a little bit of fabric.  You've got massive shorts on.  You've got massive legs.  You're a big guy.  You really are.  I do have linebacker cabs.  I do.  What's going on with this?  It's not as to the point as the first one, but it had some good need in it.  It's 14 minutes long.  I took two of the tracks.  One of them centers around an outburst from the alcoholic father. 
[01:51:00]  And the second one is kind of a surprise ending.  I don't want to ruin it.  Oh, I like surprises.  Anybody else?  Perhaps, let's try to guess, a fatal car crash.  Don't tell us.  Don't tell us.  I'm going to guess a fatal car crash.  I'm going to guess dad is late for work one day and decides to get help.  Oh, really?  You're looking at the good thing.  I'm going to guess sodomy.  That would be a hot ending, not a surprise.  Either car crash or he pushes mom down the stairs. 
[01:51:30]  Something violent.  Something violent.  I'm going to guess he's carrying scissors and he sneezes and accidentally gives mom a mastectomy.  A mastectomy.  Well, here's the first track.  Let's listen in.  My dad was one of the last people called an alcoholic.  He used to drink so much.  At first he didn't.  He'd go to a party and one of those business kind, you know, and all the guys around said, 
[01:52:00]  come on, Bob, take a drink or two.  He said, no, thank you.  Oh, come on, don't be one of those freaks.  So daddy said, in order not to be unsociable, he would go ahead and take a drink.  Well, he kept drinking more and more, more parties and more drinks.  Sounds like fun.  Finally, daddy would drink before he got up in the morning, after he'd get home.  Before he got up in the morning?  How the fuck?  Did daddy have an IV by the bed?  I drank before he woke up.  And what would he say when he drank? 
[01:52:30]  My kid sounds like a chipmunk.  My kid sounds like that fetus I had aborted.  Who the hell is that?  He pulled through, old hanger head.  Bastard, who saw that coming?  Last time I go to that doctor, old Dr. Nike of the stomach, that's who you got to call.  You know, it went well when there's a tread print on her belly.  Wait, what's that?  Air Jordans, why is that on your belly? 
[01:53:00]  Medical procedure.  My daddy jumped up and down on her belly until I shot across the wall.  Shot across the room, I should have said, but, you know, old litty.  Get rid of that old inconvenience.  The old, we can't go to Atlantic City this weekend.  Yeah, jumping up and down on her stomach yelling, 18 years of financial freedom, coming up. 
[01:53:30]  Vacations to places that don't have Ferris wheels, coming up.  We don't have to take separate flights anymore.  Coming up.  Coming up.  Lace it up tight.  Here it comes.  Lace it up.  Set those buckets up, honey.  Let's make this fun.  Steve, don't encourage him. 
[01:54:00]  It's the coming up.  Coming up.  That really sells it.  Well, he's just trying to make his life feel a little bit better, like this is something we're accomplishing.  It's a good thing.  That's right.  All right, let's go back to this thing.  Call.  You're at dinner after dinner.  We go to bed.  That's all that it would do. 
[01:54:30]  Well, Mr. Dad, I said, Daddy, I wish you could get saved.  He said, I made me really well.  I said, Daddy, please, ask Jesus to come in your heart and save you.  I said, quit it.  I said, Daddy, if you don't get saved, you're going to go to hell.  You don't get saved?  That's a whole religious thing going on here, huh?  Yeah, these are, I did a little bit of research.  These are done by the characters called Little Marky, and they're a bunch of Christian records.  Little Marky.  Little Marky.  Little Marky. 
[01:55:00]  And, yeah, they're all very preachy, so you've got to sift through all that preachy stuff to get to the actual funny parts.  Yeah.  We're just a bunch of jerks.  I like Little Marky.  Little Marky.  I wonder if he wears little boxers like Marky Mark, shows off those little abs, still has that little thing coming out of his belly button.  Oh, boy.  Daddy got up and he started chasing me around the living room. 
[01:55:30]  He told me if I didn't watch it, I was going to get you.  I said, oh, Daddy, please don't hit me.  He took a ball back.  He started to swing.  And Mama come out right outside by the kitchen door just at the same time.  Daddy, it's running.  I like this guy.  Oh, this guy's a real go-getter.  Saves my ass.  Hand me that Bat Boy.  Oh.  Chased a little Marky. 
[01:56:00]  And then Scatman Crothers came in and he hit him in the chest.  Daddy's book was really redundant.  Mama tried to find me and saw a bunny rabbit blowing another man.  I was quite a willful young boy.  I needed to be corrected.  So did Mommy.  Oh, the drunk swings a towering high fly ball deep to center field. 
[01:56:30]  Mom's head goes over the fence.  He caught it.  Oh, wait.  I thought it was a home run.  Any hitter?  Any hitter?  Any hitter again?  Mama didn't move for a long time.  I thought she went to go to heaven.  Well, after Mommy's been out of the hospital, Daddy promised he'd be a good boy. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, he didn't go to church Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night prayer meeting,  Thursday night meditation.  He was in all the time.  I thought my daddy was a bitch.  You know, I was so happy.  Oh, my God.  You just want to kill the whole family.  Oh.  So the wife didn't leave.  The stupid wife.  He beats her almost to death with a baseball bat.  Put her in the hospital.  Put her in the hospital.  And she doesn't leave.  Because he promises to go to church.  Yeah, well, she shouldn't have swung the bat at him on the steps. 
[01:57:30]  Backing up in that hotel light.  That's what we're going to do.  Stay away.  I'm very confused.  And Daddy said she's had her whole fucking life to think things over.  And wondered what a few minutes more was going to do her now.  She hit Daddy and dragged him to the meat locker.  And then Grady came to the door and he was very angry. 
[01:58:00]  He said Daddy didn't have to stop it for him.  But he said he'd do better if he just let him out.  Then he grabbed an axe.  And, well, you already heard Jimmy say Scammy and Crothers got it in the chair.  He's angry.  I have two little twin girls to play with. 
[01:58:30]  Boy, are they creepy.  After Daddy beat Mommy, she looked like the woman in the tub.  All swollen.  We've got to hear more of what happens.  All right.  It's the greatest opening theme in movie history.  With the car driving up the mountain.  Oh, it's the best music ever.  All right.  It got kind of rough around the house, Daddy.  Didn't let me and Mommy go to church very much.  Uh-oh.  One Sunday night it got so bad, we had to sneak out of the house. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, we went to the service and it was so great.  The singing was tremendous and the preaching was grand.  Mom and I started home and we were so happy.  But yet, we were so burdened for Daddy.  Uh-oh.  Here it comes.  What happened now?  Here it comes.  There's always irony with these things.  All I know is they went.  The father said he was going to go to church.  He was going to be a good guy after beating up the wife with the baseball bat. 
[01:59:30]  Going to his meeting.  Going to the meeting.  Going to church.  Then he starts falling back into his old bad habits.  He's drinking again.  Didn't go to church.  But the mother and the son go to church.  And all I know is right now, they're done.  They had a great time at church.  And are they driving home?  I believe they were driving home.  Who's driving?  Was it Dad?  No, I think the mom's driving.  See, the ironic thing would be if they got hit by a drunk driver.  Oh, that would be great.  You know?  Please let it happen.  Could be.  We were so burdened for Daddy. 
[02:00:00]  We opened the door.  And there was Daddy sitting in his favorite chair again.  Is he dead?  Uh-oh, no.  He's in his favorite chair.  Is Daddy dead?  Dad's in his favorite chair.  You're kidding me.  How did it happen?  Who is this?  Is this?  He was just drinking.  Oh, no.  He was drunk.  He was drunk.  Mommy walked over to him and she said, 
[02:00:30]  Honey, when are you going to get your life straightened out and accept Jesus?  She deserves another face on that.  He said, leave me alone.  I couldn't believe my ears.  I said, Daddy, you promised Mommy and me you would never drink again.  Why did you do it?  I said, leave me alone.  Oh, Daddy, I'm going to pray for you about it.  And my father said something I never heard him say. 
[02:01:00]  Fuck you, you little fucking fucker.  Said something he never heard him say.  What do you think he said, Jimmy?  Stop talking, kid, and put this in your mouth.  At least I hope that's what he said.  What could he have possibly said?  Mommy's sleeping now.  Help me drag her into the tub and get that chainsaw.  And get those garbage bags.  Oh, my God. 
[02:01:30]  I hope that's what he said.  What did he say?  I don't know.  It could be, I hate you.  Maybe he said, son.  Drinking's more fun.  Son, you and your brother get in the minivan.  Mommy's taking you for a lift.  He said, you have to go to the Steinbergs.  Joel and Hedda are going to babysit you.  Quick, baby-killing parents.  Oh, hmm.  There's such a shortage of them. 
[02:02:00]  We got audio of what he said, I guess.  Yeah, let's, I gotta, I gotta know what he said.  We're all wondering and waiting here.  I think this is what he said.  Yeah, if that queued up, I would have it.  Ooh.  All right, well, we'll go back to this then.  I hate you.  Yes, I hate you.  And I hate you, mother.  And I hate everybody.  And I hate God.  Oh, Daddy, don't say that.  I do.  I love the little son of a bitch.  I fell to my bedroom and fell to the bed and broke it. 
[02:02:30]  And I was laying down.  I said, Jesus, we got through the clothes, my man.  I said, this is your buddy, Marty.  Speaking to me at the end, did you hear my daddy out in the living room?  Did he say he hates mommy?  Did he say he hates me?  Did he say he hates you?  Oh, Jesus.  I do anything to see my daddy saved.  Please save you.  Oh.  In Jesus' name. 
[02:03:00]  Oh.  Your daddy is a waste.  Accept it.  Deal with it.  Your daddy's a drunk.  Your daddy is a sot and a sodomite.  And I cried myself to sleep that night.  I woke up the next morning.  I had a big pain in my chest.  I said, Daddy, Mom, come here, quick.  They ran in.  What's wrong?  Oh, my chest took so bad.  I said, will you stay home from Christian school today? 
[02:03:30]  And you're okay.  I said, all right.  I stayed home.  And as the day went on, the worst I got.  How did I go to Christian doctor and he examined me?  Marky?  Oh.  Oh, it's so bad.  He has a broken heart over here.  Marky?  Oh, yes, sir.  Are you ready to go see Jesus?  What?  What?  Oh, yes. 
[02:04:00]  Who saw this coming?  Are you ready to go see Jesus?  Are you ready to go see Jesus?  I know what happened.  Little Marky and his mother apparently raped and killed this guy's wife and daughter.  And he's asking, do you believe in Jesus?  Well, you're going to meet him.  You're going to meet him.  Oh, no.  Let's see.  Could it be fetal alcohol syndrome?  No, no.  I don't know.  This kid's 11 already.  Are you ready to go see Jesus? 
[02:04:30]  You mean I'm going to die?  He said yes.  Well, I'm ready to go see Jesus.  But my dad is not.  He said, I think you better call your mommy and daddy in right now.  And I did.  Daddy.  Song?  Mama.  No?  They walked in and they were both crying.  I said, Daddy, the doctor said I'm going to go see Jesus tonight. 
[02:05:00]  And I'm so happy because I love Jesus and we're good friends.  But daddy, I'll love you for your kid.  Daddy said, why?  I'm a good man.  Daddy, the Bible says all of a sudden comes to the glory of God.  And because you sinned away, your son is death, daddy.  But the gift of God is eternal life.  He gives it to you freely, daddy.  And I, too, couldn't.  Mommy, too, couldn't.  We've been wanting you to take over daddy.  You look, silly.  Of course he's drinking. 
[02:05:30]  Listen to this shit.  Daddy, I love you.  Daddy, I love you.  Daddy, please don't go to hell.  I love you.  Daddy started crying very bad.  I said, Mommy, you pray for daddy. 
[02:06:00]  Okay.  I said, Mommy, I think daddy's going to get saved.  Okay.  Daddy, come here, daddy.  What?  What?  Daddy, why I'm so slow and so strong?  He looked down at me.  I just followed.  I took my hand and I reached up to him. 
[02:06:30]  And he grabbed my little hand.  My widow.  And he folded so tight.  I just got it.  Don't pull my fucking hand up.  I don't see you, kid.  I'll choke yourself.  Don't pull my fucking hand over there.  I said, choke yourself.  I said, choke yourself.  I said, choke yourself.  I said, choke yourself.  Now, leave me over.  Choke yourself.  Well.  No shit.  What happened to the kid?  He died.  From what?  Yeah, but what did he have? 
[02:07:00]  I don't know.  He had something wrong with him.  He got a pain?  They called a Christian doctor to the house.  We're at the little house on the prairie.  You don't take the kid to a hospital or nothing.  What's that got to do with the father's drinking?  The father's drinking.  I don't know, man.  It just takes a wild left turn about seven minutes into a 14 minute clip.  It's some kind of redemption thing.  See, the kid's fine with dying.  He was going to go see his pal Jesus.  But he'll never get to see his father again because his father doesn't believe in Jesus  and he's going to another place.  He's going to hell.  And basically...  If that isn't a commercial for hell, I don't know what is.  If you don't believe in Jesus, you don't get to see the rest of your family that believes 
[02:07:30]  in Jesus when they die.  Maybe if Jesus had a little compassion, he'd fucking ask the father who's drinking and  kicking the shit out of the mother and let the kid have a few years.  Yeah, really?  Maybe Jesus should cut the malarkey.  The Lord works in mysterious ways.  He sure does.  That are really fucked up and unfair.  Daddy, are you...  I'm already in it.  You sound like Marion, kid.  I'm going to be out of hell in about five minutes when your heart stops beating.  Take that awful blue room and change it into an office. 
[02:08:00]  Coming up.  Steve, don't encourage him.  Out with Disney, in with Vegas.  He's doing math in the head.  All right, $35 for this.  Flowers, little coffin.  Is that in burial?  A little coffin.  A little Marky's coffin.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's, um...  That's something, huh?  People are really disturbed by the fact that they're trying to convert someone using complete 
[02:08:30]  guilt.  Yeah, wasn't this kid killed a while back?  Well, that's right.  This kid never had a life.  This kid is just...  I don't know what...  He's amazing.  He dies at the end of every skit.  He's like Kenny.  Yeah.  I think Bob Kelly's at home right now blubbering into his...  Oh, Bob is just crying.  He's blubbering into his afghan.  When the little kid said, hold my hand, I understood.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold it. 
[02:09:00]  There's a hanger in my head, dude.  There's a hanger in my head, dude.  I didn't see the kid dropping dead.  Not again.  This river don't go there, Antri.  You done taken the wrong turn.  Now let's see who just dropped them pants.  Drop?  Just take them right off.  Ah, what the fuck? 
[02:09:30]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, fuck.  Come on, squeal.  Squeal.  Eeeeee.  Ah.  Eeeeee.  Ah.  Eeeeee.  Ah.  Eeeeee.  Ah, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  The Bob Kelly remix is still coming in.  That's good.  Pat from Unaki is saying the kid...  Who's this kid?  Jason?  He won't die. 
[02:10:00]  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  That's kind of funny.  Well, Jason.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  What have we got here, fucking comedian?  Jim!  Whatever you do, don't fall down.  That would break my fucking heart.  You're down your way down.  I'm down.  Get your fat ass up!  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah!  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  What's your excuse?  I snapped my knee, man.  Oh, no.  I broke my knee, man.  Ah, ah.  I'm asking the fucking questions here, private.  Do you understand?  I broke my knee, man.  Well, thank you very much.  Can I be in charge for a while? 
[02:10:30]  Ah, ah, ah, ah!  Do you feel dizzy?  Ah, ah!  Do you feel fake?  Ah, ah!  Ah, ah!  What is your major malfunction, nub-nut?  I broke that fucking thing.  I broke it.  I broke my leg.  You have to un-fuck yourself, or I will unscrew your head and chip down your neck. 
[02:11:00]  That's pretty good.  That wasn't bad, right?  That was from Rob from Columbia, South Carolina.  Very nice.  All right.  A couple Bob Kelly remixes.  I heard one last night from a Star Trek one that was pretty funny.  It had Spock and Kirk discussing killing Bob.  Oh, really?  Where is that one?  Do we have it?  Is that the one?  No, no.  That's something else.  Oh, okay. 
[02:11:30]  They don't have the new one?  Maybe we could look for that.  I heard it online.  Yeah.  I think it's on Whackbag or something.  That's pretty funny?  Yeah.  Now, why don't we take a break?  We'll regroup, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program in just a bit.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U.  line.  I want to give a big F to you to myself for leaving the fucking disaster open after being  away for three days.  I'm a motherfucking moron.  Yeah, I want to give a big F to you to Hollywood. 
[02:12:00]  You're going to have comedy sex, and you fucking suckers, you fucking suckers, you human beings.  Fuck you, boy.  Sure.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to give a big fuck you to Hollywood.  You take a good show like the Honeymooners and you turn into a piece of shit.  Say, Hollywood.  Fuck you.  Hey, this is Kevin from Chicago.  How you doing?  I'm not going to say fuck or a cub because I know I can't get it recorded, so. 
[02:12:30]  You know what?  You guys have a good time, and enjoy yourself.  Fuck you, Ricky, for having your assault on Opie and Anthony's media.  You motherfucker!  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Well, fuck you very much. 
[02:13:00]  Hey, guys, what's the day, fellas?  What?  All right, we're back with the ONA program on XM Satellite Radio.  We've got lots to do still today.  The third installment of Mayor Menino babbling.  We'll get to that today.  Also, remind me to talk about the breastfeeding that was happening the other day outside ABC Studios. 
[02:13:30]  Debacle involving Barbara Walters and some tits.  We've got Bin Laden's niece on 2020.  2020.  We've got some freak yelling, you're not supposed to masturbate.  We'll have to get Steve in for that.  I don't know what that's about.  I love how these things are presented.  Yeah.  I know.  Some freak yelling, you're not supposed to masturbate.  It just says, University of Florida chick freaks out and yells, you're not supposed to masturbate. 
[02:14:00]  She actually yelled that at Steve while he was in front of a grammar school.  And we found the Bob Kelly Star Trek remix.  All right.  And we also have this today.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  D-O-B-N.  Anthony Shaw.  Dee Dee.  Bop, bop, bop.  Dee Dee.  It's the first ONA jingle to come in.  That isn't a jingle.  That's shit.  It's good, Ant.  It's a B-B-D-D-D-D-D. 
[02:14:30]  A la-dee-dot-dee-dee.  It's catchy, right, Jimmy?  I'll say it is.  I can't stop holding it.  Oh, wait.  Jimmy does it.  Now I like it.  Sho-bee-doo-doo-doo.  Homophobic.  It's nice.  Did you want me to forward you all the other ones that come in tonight?  No.  My health won't allow it.  Hey, we've got to say hi to Brian Hurta.  Brian, are you there?  Or did he give up on us?  Brian, he's not there?  Danny?  He's on hold.  All right.  I hear something. 
[02:15:00]  Our interview with Brian Hurta.  Hello?  Brian?  I hear everyone yelling outside the studio.  I purposely didn't, but like someone's being yelled at right now.  What happened, Danny?  What happened?  Danny?  I purposely did not put his name up there because he's not there yet.  Oh, okay, Danny.  That's Don on the phone.  Don of the Don and Mike show?  Don?  Don.  Why doesn't the person say hi?  There's definitely someone there.  He might have ran over to the 80s to go grab a NASCAR dude. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  Who is that?  That's not NASCAR.  This is what I do.  Holy Jesus.  Sorry.  You mix that up, people will shoot you in certain areas of this country.  Of course.  Certain.  South of Jersey.  That's right.  Exactly.  South of Jersey.  The deep south.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, there he goes.  That was a good interview.  Thank you, Brian.  Yeah, he was a little dry, but I enjoyed him.  All right.  Why don't we get into something else?  Oh, well, the Star Trek thing.  You were just talking about it before the break.  This would be a good place.  That was one I heard yesterday. 
[02:16:00]  I'm a big Star Trek fan, so I got a chuckle.  A chuckle.  A chuckle out of this one.  All right.  From the maker of the Robert Kelly Homer Simpson remix, the mix that Steve sees that was fucking  terrible, but everybody else loved, comes a new mix with high hopes of winning Steve's  approval, and perhaps a four-star rating.  Todd from Framingham Studios presents the Robert Kelly Star Trek remix.  Captain's log, stardate 4523.3. 
[02:16:30]  Deep Space Station K7 has issued a priority one call.  We're going in armed for battle.  It's not life as we know or understand it.  Oh, my hand, boy.  Don't be afraid.  Use my hand.  There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal. 
[02:17:00]  I'm sorry, Mr. Spock.  But I'm afraid the creature must die.  I see no alternative myself, Captain.  It really seems a pity.  Set your faces on Force 3 to kill.  What the fuck?  Hey, I like that.  I kind of like that one.  The what the fuck at the end is the real payoff.  Force 3 to kill.  Bravo. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, what the fuck?  That was Todd from Framingham?  Yeah.  Bravo, Todd.  That's pretty funny.  That was funny.  A little Star Trek.  Sure.  Just when we thought the bit was dead.  Well, we get that little, well.  It is, but.  It never really lived, but.  No.  All right.  Breastfeeding moms protest.  I was a bit on the Opie and Anthony show.  I was enjoying myself, having a good time.  But once again, they killed me. 
[02:18:00]  They play me over and over again, not knowing when to end it until I'm dead.  We've done a much better job with that, though.  Yeah.  We used to be really bad.  Really bad at beating things into the ground.  We should get a little lounge chair for Jimmy.  I'm all relaxed.  At the beginning of the show, he's kind of upright.  He's got the mic in front of him.  And then toward the middle of the show, he does this thing where he lounges out.  His feet are up.  He pulls the mic down.  And now he's pretty much lounging.  I'm just, I'm really tired. 
[02:18:30]  You know, I just try to relax.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't stand it because my foot's been sore.  My foot's getting better, though.  It's also the fart hour, too.  I know.  I have no guess.  And then what he does is he lays down.  So now it's got a better way to release.  This way, he won't even notice.  He wants everyone else to enjoy the goodness.  No, I'll just lean forward.  When I want to release gas, I'm stressed out.  But now I pull in and the cheeks come off a little bit.  And then I fight.  Quiet.  Move back.  No one knows what happened.  Yeah, no one knows until three seconds, four seconds later.  And your taste buds are assaulted.  This is the farting hour. 
[02:19:00]  Taste buds.  He farts every day around 9.30.  9.30 to 10.  Looking forward to it.  All right, Anthony.  So what's up with the breastfeeding outside ABC?  You knew about this one.  I heard this on the news on the way in.  So nearly 150 angry moms.  One hundred and fifty.  That's 300 tits if they're all healthy.  Angry in capital letters, Anthony.  So they must have been really angry.  Well, Barbara Walters said something on her show on The View that upset breastfeeding mothers. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, no.  She said that when she's on an airplane, she feels uncomfortable.  That's all she said.  Uncomfortable when a woman starts breastfeeding next to her in the seat next to her on a plane.  Now, why is that so bad to say?  I can't believe I'm defending Barbara Walters, but why is that a bad thing to say?  She feels uncomfortable.  She's being honest.  It's uncomfortable.  So now a bunch of these women who are breastfeeding get together, and they're going to show her by showing up at the studios, ABC studios, and breastfeeding. 
[02:20:00]  Is there a breastfeeding group that can be, like, thrown together this quickly?  I would absolutely guarantee there is.  And how long are you allowed to be a member?  Imagine I've been in the breastfeeding group for seven years.  Here's my kid.  Seven-year-old boy sucking on the tit.  With a Boston Red Sox baseball cap on backwards so he can get to the goodness.  She's just got to bend over a little bit.  He stands there like a young man that he is. 
[02:20:30]  The longer someone's a member, the more likely their child is retarded.  And I've been here for 17 years.  We know.  But if that gets women down here with their tits out, let me say, I am very uncomfortable when people breastfeed while I jerk off.  I'm very uncomfortable about that.  Uh-oh.  If you show up.  Now, look, we go right to our interview.  Oops.  Brian?  Good one, Jimmy.  Sorry you had to hear that.  I hope you don't think that's, you know, what our show is about, sir. 
[02:21:00]  No, I've heard your show, so I've got to find this idea.  Oh, you have?  Oh, okay.  I don't like when people just say, I've heard your show.  No, okay.  I love your show.  How's that?  Oh, hey, hey.  All right.  Name one bit we've done.  Oh, come on.  You guys put me on the spot.  Put him on the spot.  It's Brian Hurta, everyone.  That's right.  Are you for or against breastfeeding, Brian?  For breastfeeding.  Very good.  Very popular.  That's good.  Were you just talking to Bruce Kelly? 
[02:21:30]  I was.  On the 80s?  I was just on the 80s show, yeah.  Sorry to hear that.  How awful was it?  What would you rather do?  Talk to Bruce Kelly again or hit the wall at 215 miles an hour?  I had a good time.  I like the 80s show.  No, no.  Don't misunderstand me.  We love the 80s.  We love the 80s show, too, and the channel and the songs.  It's Bruce Kelly we're talking about.  I still like Bruce.  How did you keep from dozing off when you were talking to Bruce?  Oh, well, I got to pick the music, so.  Oh, is that it?  You were kind of doing a guest jock thing? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Were his pants pulled all the way up to his mid-nipple?  Are you in Washington?  I am.  I'm at XM Studios here.  Oh, so you were live with Bruce?  Yeah.  Yeah, sitting here with him.  Wow.  Are you still sitting with him?  No.  No, I'm not now.  All right.  Yeah, did you notice how high up his pants are pulled?  Well, he was sitting behind the desk.  I didn't catch that.  Oh, you didn't?  Next time, go in and say, like, goodbye to him or something, and just look at his pants.  They're pulled up to his nipples.  Yeah, he actually doesn't even tie the tie around his neck. 
[02:22:30]  He just loops it into his belt.  He's got, like, a camel toe in front, too.  They pull up so high that his balls make some kind of camel toe.  Oh, sorry.  Too much now?  I'm sorry.  How did you know the Bruce Kelly interview was over?  They just waved smelling salts under your nose?  All right.  Well, why don't we interview Brian?  Yeah, we'll talk to you a little bit about, man, Indy 500.  How many people get to do that?  I mean, really.  33 every year.  Every year. 
[02:23:00]  And this, is it one of those childhood dreams of yours?  I think every kid growing up, every boy wants to be a race car driver and race in the Indy 500.  Was that one of yours as a kid?  Yeah.  No, that was it.  That's what I wanted to do as a kid.  So, you know, just having a good time.  Lucky to be doing it.  How did you make the jump from just a dopey kid dreaming to actually racing?  I started racing when I was 12.  I started racing carts, which is like, you know, it's like Little League for racing.  How do parents allow kids to do that?  I don't know.  Like, my mother wouldn't let me get, like, a minibike. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Not as long as you live under my roof.  And you know when you're seven or eight, it's going to be a long time before you get a minibike?  I wasn't allowed to play football.  Oh, that was my thing in my house.  We weren't allowed to play football.  Yeah.  And these guys are racing carts at 12 years old.  My parents didn't like me all that much, so they're like, yeah, okay.  Put them out there, yeah.  Yeah, here's a bottle of whiskey, kid.  Have fun.  So you started at 12, and I guess you kind of had something, you kind of had a talent for it?  Yeah, I just started winning, and I went to, when I turned 18, I went to one of those racing schools 
[02:24:00]  and got my racing license and started racing cars and winning races.  And within a couple of years, A.J. Foyt called me up and hired me to drive for him at the Indy 500 and 94,  and that was my first Indy car race.  Now, let me ask you something, though.  When did you start driving cars?  When I was 18.  No, come on.  Race cars or just start driving cars?  Driving cars in general, where Dad's like, all right, obviously, kid, you got something,  but the driving age is whatever in your state. 
[02:24:30]  It's bad.  My dad used to let me sit on his lap and drive the car when I was like eight.  Nice.  Really?  Yeah.  I used to, this is kind of funny, I used to when I was like 12,  12, my mom would like, you know, take my sister and I on errands,  and she'd say, I'm going to run in the bank, and I'd say, leave the keys in the car  because I want to listen to the radio.  And she'd go in the bank, and I'd drive the car around the parking lot and park again.  And my mom would come back out.  My sister always tried to bust me, say, he drove the car, he drove the car. 
[02:25:00]  And my mom, to this day, doesn't believe it.  You're just trying to get your brother in trouble.  Yeah, because it would be ridiculous for you to actually be driving around.  Yeah.  Don't do that, kids.  That's bad.  Yes, of course.  Very bad.  Of course, you're a role model now.  You really have three major open-wheel racing wins and nine poles.  Jimmy, shut up reading.  He's reading your bio and trying to ask you a question like he knows what the hell he's talking about.  I'm asking because we have bad information here.  Jimmy knows nothing.  He actually called you that NASCAR guy. 
[02:25:30]  I certainly didn't know his car.  Yes, you did, Jimmy.  Yes, you did.  This is the fact sheet we have on Brian.  I know he drove the XM car.  It said, finished third at the Indy 500, and then a few things down.  Damn respectable, by the way, sir.  Heard his best finish at the Indianapolis 500 came in 2004 when he finished in fourth place.  Ah.  So we have two bits of information.  Okay, well, I did finish in fourth in 2004, and then they just added that on the top because I just finished third.  Hey, dude, at least you beat the chick.  Oh, thank God.  Man, if you beat the chick. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, thank God.  She's a really good driver, and I know that.  So, like, for me, it wouldn't have been so bad, but I would have had such a damn hard time going home to my buddies.  Of course.  Because they would have just, oh, it would have been.  She came in, what, fourth?  Fourth?  She finished fourth right behind me.  Right behind you.  I passed her with, like, three laps to go.  And you were, like, thank God.  Motivated.  Motivated, yeah.  Of course.  Was she putting on her makeup, and that's how you got to pass her?  Was she doing that, like that eyelash curler or something?  No.  No?  No, she was running fast. 
[02:26:30]  It was, yeah, it was tough.  Yeah, I hear she's, like, really, really good.  Because I remember a few years back, maybe in the 80s or something, there was some chick that was in the Indy, and she was just an abomination.  Real disaster out there.  She's the fourth woman that's raced in Indy.  Yeah.  But she's definitely, like, the best, like, the most competitive.  Like, you know, she's not just kind of there.  She's right in the mix.  Well, a lot of people are comparing her in a weird way to Tiger Woods just because of the perception of who is supposed to be engaging in this sport and who's, like, as opposed to golf, which is a totally different pace. 
[02:27:00]  And I guess you'd have to say yes to that, right?  Yeah.  Well, I guess in the respect that, yeah, I get more questions about Danica than I do myself right now.  Doesn't that stink?  Well, maybe, come on, if you hit the gas pedal a little harder and came in first, for God's sake.  No, that's not even true.  Hold on.  The difference between her and Tiger, she hasn't won yet.  Yeah.  Right, right, right, right.  But, you know, Tiger, like, dominated.  If she starts dominating, then I get it.  Just going back slightly, you know, in all the New York papers, they had just nothing but pictures and articles about her, and they didn't even show the dude that won the race. 
[02:27:30]  They showed, like, a little picture of him.  My teammate, Weldon, yeah.  Okay, see, I didn't even know his name, but I knew that the chick came in fourth.  Yeah.  Cover that up.  That's one of those things, you know.  It's like a – and it's bad because, you know, she is talented and stuff, but it is kind of that novelty thing that's going to get the press, unfortunately.  Right now, right now.  But, I mean, she's running good, too.  So, I guess, you know, if she starts winning, then it'll be worth it.  What's the difference at Indy?  Like, why are you third and not first? 
[02:28:00]  Your car didn't break down.  You're a good driver.  You have a great team behind the car.  What is the difference between first and third?  And don't say, you know, two places, but, you know, what makes that difference?  Well, it's just on a 500-mile race, it's a lot of it.  It's just how things all work out.  You know, there's a lot of pit stops and strategy and, you know, where you are at the track at the end of the race and how good your car is at the end when it really matters.  I mean, it went yellow with a lap and a half to go. 
[02:28:30]  I was just getting ready to pass Vitor Amira for a second.  So, yeah, I don't think I had enough time to get Weldon.  And you hit the brake a few times.  No.  No, actually.  Take those brakes out.  There are no brakes.  I learned that in that racing movie.  What racing movie?  The one with Tom Cruise.  They hit the brakes.  And then all of a sudden, you can just hit the gas and go right by the guy at the last second because that's how it's really done.  That was Top Gun in the plane. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  When he slammed the airbrake on and then, no, I'm talking about the race car movie.  What are you talking about?  They actually brake and hit the gas pedal really hard at the end when they had to surge past the driver.  Brian, I want to apologize for both Opie and Jimmy.  I happen to know, this is my question.  Everybody knows the biggest racing movie of all time is Bobby Deerfield.  How true to life was that?  You never even saw it, right?  Pacino played a race car driver.  I've never even heard of that movie.  Al Pacino played a race car driver.  What an awful thing. 
[02:29:30]  It's a cool race car movie, and it turns out to be some chick flick.  It was awful.  The only good one that I've ever seen is Grand Prix.  Oh, yeah.  That was good.  Yeah, definitely.  James Garner.  Yeah.  Man.  Did you like Fast Times at Ridgemont High?  I did like that movie.  Did you like Damone?  The what?  Damone.  The character Damone, his friend?  Oh, Damone, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we liked him, too.  Hey, what do you think of the NASCAR guys? 
[02:30:00]  Well, I don't know.  The Indy guys cannot stand the NASCAR guys.  They just seem as a bunch of tobacco-spitting hillbillies.  Yeah, come on, Brian.  Let's get into this.  Well, you know damn well the fans don't get along.  Don't they?  No, they don't.  Well, what's the biggest...  Indy fans and NASCAR fans do not get along.  What's the biggest complaint that you guys have with NASCAR?  Say that again?  He's not going to answer.  I can't keep up with you guys.  He's not going to answer.  What's the biggest complaint you have about the NASCAR guys? 
[02:30:30]  I don't really have a big complaint about the NASCAR guys.  No?  No.  They're just such low class, aren't they?  No, not the drivers.  Well, a friend of mine is actually...  Not the drivers.  A friend of mine is a big fan of both, actually, which is rare.  And he said that a lot of times the fans will have different feelings about what's going on and about the races.  And then sometimes they won't get along, but other times, you know, it can...  Yeah, but the NASCAR thing is a little more, like, it's got a little bit of a, like, a WWF kind of vibe. 
[02:31:00]  Ah, there you go.  That was a very subtle little smack to their face.  Well, it's kind of like a, you know, world wrestling thing if you like phony hillbillies.  I mean, they're perfect.  They didn't say that.  If you like incest, NASCAR is the place for you.  I will never get a job offer from NASCAR.  Thank you, guys.  I can't believe Brian Hurt is just trashing NASCAR like this.  It's amazing.  He's not trashing NASCAR.  I heard it.  Everyone else heard it.  No one heard anything.  And making racist remarks.  Oh, my God.  He is not.  He's a gentleman.  Well, Brian, they're telling me that you have to go. 
[02:31:30]  Do I?  Okay.  Yeah, unfortunately.  More interviews for you?  Yeah, I've got a busy day.  What is your goal as a driver?  It's obviously a very scary profession to most of us who will never have the balls to do it.  What is your goal as far as being a race car driver?  I'd love to win the Indy 500 and win the season championship.  Of course.  That's like the Super Bowl.  That is the pinnacle, right, of racing is the Indy 500 win.  The old brickyard.  What's the one question everyone asks you, Brian?  What do you do when you have to go to the bathroom? 
[02:32:00]  That's a great question.  Yeah, what do you do?  That's a good one.  Well, I try and go ahead of time, but I don't, but a lot of guys do.  They just kind of take care of business out there.  Just kind of go in your uniform?  If you've got to go, you've got to go.  Do you think some of the guys wear Depends just to kind of soak it all up?  I doubt it.  Well, hey, it's like the astronauts, I mean, in Apollo 13, when they're ready to take off,  the guy was just whizzing in his suit.  It's like, what are you going to do, not go?  You don't want to put Depends on because, God forbid, you have a wreck.  You certainly don't want to be wheeled in wearing diapers. 
[02:32:30]  A pair of diapers.  That doesn't look good.  That doesn't look macho.  How long does the race take?  Indy takes about a little over three hours, three to three and a half.  You can wait to pee if you've got to whiz.  Just go beforehand.  Yeah, it all depends on how many close calls you get in front of you.  You might shit your pants, never mind taking a leak.  Yeah.  Any scary moments there, Brian?  Oh, yeah, always.  Always a scary moment.  Oh, my God, there was that one time.  Brian, tell Anthony about that one time you had.  That one time?  Yeah.  Did you almost have a big crash? 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, I forgot what, where was it?  Oh, when I crashed in Toronto?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Were you hurt or no?  Yeah, I broke my pelvis in seven places.  Jesus.  That wasn't fun.  Really?  How long were you out of commission for?  Oh, like six months.  Damn, and whose fault was that?  Nobody's.  It was in practice.  Really?  I was on my own.  I don't even know what happened.  It wasn't even a race, Anthony.  Just lost it in a turn or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think something broke on the car, but, you know, it was so beat up by the time I finished 
[02:33:30]  with it, you can't really tell.  Damn.  You've got to give it to the engineers that put these things together, man, because years  ago, you hit the wall going that fast.  It was over, Johnny.  Now it's like, you know, you guys are pretty well protected in there.  Brian?  Yes?  Do you speed on the highway?  No, I don't, you know, I don't drive that fast on the road.  Not as fast as you'd think, probably.  What kind of car do you drive in your personal life?  My wife drives faster on the street than I do.  Really?  By a lot.  What kind of car do you have at home? 
[02:34:00]  Be funny if it's like a Ford Taurus.  No, you already said it.  I know.  He drives a new van.  I'm trying to, I'll say I'm trying to buy, my teammates got a Ferrari 360 Stradale  I'm trying to buy often, but right now what I have is, I drive an Acura MDX.  Oh, okay.  I got two kids, you know.  Yeah.  I got a TV in the back and that.  You get pulled over and the cop goes, hey, what are you, a race car driver?  Well, yeah.  That's classic.  Other than the state of Indiana, that doesn't get you out of anything, my experience has been.  Really? 
[02:34:30]  Brian, by the way, happy birthday.  We had the same birthday.  Oh, thank you.  And I guess they're telling us you really have to go now.  Yeah.  Oh.  We're going to let you be.  Okay.  Thank you very much for having me on, guys.  Brian, good luck in the future, Brian.  Thanks, buddy.  And please do our show again.  We don't bite.  Okay, I will.  All right, there he goes.  See you, man.  I've heard a...  Drives the XM car.  Drives the XM Indy car.  It's a very respectable finish.  You seem like a pretty cool guy.  Yeah, he's cool.  Ben was panicking.  Walking in and out.  Why, they had a go?  Yeah, had a go.  Are there interviews?  You really did have to go?  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  What's more important than this show?  They're telling us...  Upstairs in Washington.  Wasn't one of those, they're telling us you have to go and no one really was telling us anything?  No, no, this is one...  They really are.  But I'm getting a lot of calls about Bruce Kelly just bashing us nonstop.  Bruce?  Yeah.  Let's go to Justin on Long Island.  He's not bashing us.  He is.  What's up, Open Ant, my little asteroid champion.  How you guys doing?  I've been better, sir, but I've also been worse.  I try to take everything with a grain of salt.  Pretty much life on life's terms.  That's my little boy.  Listen, I was scrolling through the channels when you guys were on commercial. 
[02:35:30]  I came across fucking Bruce Kelly interviewing that asshole.  Hold on, that asshole.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, I think Brian Hurt could be a friend of the show.  I liked him.  We liked Brian.  What are you talking about?  It was like interviewing my librarian, for Christ's sake.  It was nice.  He's a race car driver.  He drives in circles and he goes fast.  Right?  We liked him, though.  Very true.  But Bruce Kelly is now at a point where he's actually calling your show and interviewing  freaking Danny.  He put Danny on the air and interviewed him. 
[02:36:00]  What?  Danny, you made the 80s shot this morning?  Apparently.  Why?  Just because of that shirt?  What's wrong with his shirt?  Nothing.  If you're fucking shopping in a chest hanging in a mall somewhere in fucking Ronkonkoma.  Hey, this is Target, buddy.  Yeah, apparently Bruce Kelly wanted to simulcast Brian's appearance on the show, so he called  the hotline.  Oh.  And unbeknownst to me, he put me through on the air.  Oh, you can sue him now.  I know, and I totally blew him off, too, so. 
[02:36:30]  It'd be funny if we got a cease and desist and sued XM for playing our stuff on another  channel.  After all of it we do.  Yeah, and Logan got fired and Bruce was promoted and fired us.  And then Danny finally admitted that he was in Laverne and Shirley.  He just goes, yeah, we got Brian in the studio.  And I'm like, well, great.  Why don't you have him hang up and call our program?  And he didn't really like that too much.  Yeah, but did he put you on the air?  No, it was on the air.  I don't give a shit, really.  I don't care.  Okay, Jim.  Did Bruce get to hear our interview with Brian? 
[02:37:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right, let's go to Joe in Florida.  Joe?  Hey, Bo.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, Danny just pissed all over Bruce Kelly.  Did he?  Oh, he just pissed all over him.  Bruce came off and said, hey, you know, well, we got a show going on.  He'll call you when we're done.  So Danny said, well, we don't?  And he said, well, you know, we'll have him simulacast.  He's like, yeah, okay, whatever.  Just have him hang up and call us now.  And that was pretty much, it let Bruce stop the distraction.  And that went out over the air? 
[02:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  It stopped him right in the distraction.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  So I wasn't understanding what was going on.  We wanted Brian for the interview.  And he was still on Bruce Kelly's show.  Yeah.  So Danny was on the phone with Bruce telling Bruce that we need Brian for our show.  Yeah, but see, Bruce had called you guys first.  And it all just kind of worked.  The timing worked out perfect because you needed him anyway.  So there's Bruce Kelly going, hey, let's get him all live on the phone. 
[02:38:00]  Like, instead of playing 80s music, now he's talking.  This is like a huge opportunity for him because he doesn't get much of an opportunity to talk, I guess.  No, he had the race car guy on there.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Like, the interview for that, and then he's going to hook up with our show.  And one of our interns blew him off live on his show.  Oh, is that brutal?  And then the worst part was, you know, when he did have to finally hang up with Danny, he started bad-mouthing you guys.  You know, just a bunch of jerks and whatnot.  And I just switched off that channel. 
[02:38:30]  But he just hosed them hard, hard and long.  All right, good.  Good.  We'd love to get tape of that.  If anybody recorded it, we'd love to hear it, definitely.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Joe.  Bye, sweetie.  Thank you, Joe.  Mike in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Sugar Britches.  Hi.  My name is Jim, though.  I'd prefer if you addressed me as such.  I'm sorry.  Hey, dude, you guys didn't hear about that thing on the AP?  Hey, the girl's boyfriend jumped on her stomach at her request to end her pregnancy. 
[02:39:00]  And she can't be charged for it because of a right to an abortion, but he's going to jail.  Really?  Yeah.  I haven't heard that.  Heard it in Dallas.  All right, we'll try to find that.  All right, we're going to take a break, Anthony.  We'll get back to the breastfeeding moms.  We started that story.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The breastfeeding.  There's a group of breastfeeders out there that are really pissed off.  We've got to tape The View today because they're going to have really dumb things to say about this 
[02:39:30]  because this is a big story here in New York, okay?  And then we'll do that other thing.  You stink.  The thing.  Here.  I pulled that one off, didn't I, Anthony?  With that crash of his.  Oh, my God.  You are so lucky.  Like, you know, tell them about that one, the thing, you know, that you were involved in.  What?  Oh, the thing in Toronto?  Toronto!  Yes, of course, Toronto. 
[02:40:00]  The crash in Toronto.  You're a liar.  All right.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  I've got to tell you, though, one of the best reality shows on TV is that goddamn stupid crab fishing show.  I don't know how I got caught up in that thing.  What the hell was the crab fishing show?  Most Dangerous Catch.  Was that like by Lake Ichiguni?  Was it going from Cleveland into Canada somewhere?  And there was a storm?  The Edmund Fitzgerald? 
[02:40:30]  Well, our crab pots were full and we came into shore.  I really like that song.  Jimmy was asking his questions.  That stupid Gordon Lightfoot.  This song goes on forever.  I love it, though.  Jesus.  And the water was at my ankles and this song goes on another hour.  Is that the song that makes you just get all tingly, Jimmy?  I just like it because I like the fact that he's doing a 40-minute ballad about a bullshit cycle.  I looked at the fuel gauge, it was three-quarters full, and we motored on towards our destination. 
[02:41:00]  And then we bought a Rolls-Royce on eBay.  Hey, we could kill seven minutes.  Let this play today.  Oh, my God.  I answered my money back.  He said, drop dead, you horse-toothed Jew.  You're getting nothing back.  The lake lives on from the Chippewa on down.  The big lake they call Gitchagumi.  Gitchagumi.  All right.  The lake it is said never gives up for dead  When the skies of November turn gloomy 
[02:41:30]  Gloomy.  Get your gloomy with gloomy.  With a load of iron ore 26,000 tons more  Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty  I smelt bad from fish and put on perfumey  That good Chippin' true was a bone to be chewed  When the gales of November came early  They cast off yet?  We untied the bow line and untied the stern  And I started the engine with a turn of the key  Every friggin' step of the way 
[02:42:00]  In the Edmund Fitzgerald.  We get it already.  We get it.  You're on a boat.  I took a compass heading of 135  And I turned the wheel  And the purser got me my coffee  I take it light and sweet  But he made it too dark  And I sent him back to the galley  All right.  What happened?  What happened next?  I went to sleep in my hand's sleep paralysis  And I woke up to the exorcist's face in my bed  It was on forever 
[02:42:30]  The wind and the wind and the wind made a tattletale song  And the wind broke over the railing  The song's only half over and I still see the dock  I forgot my wallet in my car  So we turned the ship around  And we docked again  And I figured I'd stop for the air 
[02:43:00]  When afternoon came  It was freezing rain  Tune in and two hours later  When the ship finally sinks  Enough  And then there's a throw in a musical interlude  To make it longer  Christ  Obi and Anthony  The virus is spreading  All right, breastfeeding. 
[02:43:30]  That's where we were  Why am I going to hate myself when I hear the replay?  I don't know  It says, Anthony 
[02:44:00]  When you hear the replay  You're going to hate yourself  Why?  Why would you instant feedback that  When I have no clue what the fuck you're talking about?  And does anyone know what he's talking about?  Yes  It's not even me  Shut up, Jimmy  You do not  It's not even just me  It's everybody  This is another self-important douchebag  That assumes because he thinks something  That everyone must  How about including why  I will hate myself when I hear the replay 
[02:44:30]  Ass head  Well, because everyone knows, Anne  And we're too scared to tell you  Yep  Is that it?  Yeah, it was a biggie too  Well, it was that thing from Toronto, right?  You said something positive about somebody of another color  All right  Then I will hate myself  Oh, Jesus  I'm kidding, of course  Shut up  Oh, my God  I'm going to be shocking and outrageous  Shock, shock, shock  Shock, shock  I'm a shock, shock  We're shocking  We're shocking the country 
[02:45:00]  I've had enough, by the way  Of the articles in the paper  Pope rips same-sex marriages  Hey, here's news for everybody  The Pope doesn't like fags getting married  And fags, you should stop seeking the approval of the church  There you go  Fuck the church  And the church says, fuck you  Just live separately  Enough already  And it's never going to change  No  The church is not going to accept that type of behavior  And I agree with the gays  Get married if you want to live that life of misery  Who leaves the church?  Just live together and bang each other 
[02:45:30]  What do you need all the legal tie-ups for?  They just want to be accepted  Well, they want partner benefits, too  Get your partner benefits  Yeah, they want health insurance  That stuff's fair  All right, here we go  It's all about health insurance  Good point  Breastfeeding, Anthony  So, where were we?  Barbara Walters says she felt uncomfortable  Because she was on a flight  And some lady was breastfeeding next door  Next door  And she said she feels uncomfortable  And most people do feel uncomfortable  When they see that going down  I'm uncomfortable around women  Even that breastfeed  All women?  Yeah  Even the young ones? 
[02:46:00]  Even the hot ones  With the breasts that are just gorging  They're just begging for attention  Those big boobs that are begging for attention  And the little kid is there  Those big juice-filled memories  It's like, oh, I can't fit anymore in here  Where's my kid?  No  Nothing?  Leaking into a bra  Nothing  Just leaking  Because the boobs are wanting  Sorry, kids  Sweet, sugary, life-giving treat 
[02:46:30]  It ain't doing nothing for me  Nothing  The new mother can't even find a bra  That's big enough  Yeah  Because they just want to be swinging  Like warm cereal milk  They're pushing, they're pushing  Why is it hot?  They're pushing  It's not hot  Babies are just the destroyers  They are the tits wrecking ball  It's just  They ruin breasts  Why do I want  Even if there's some hot chick breastfeeding 
[02:47:00]  You just know what's being ravaged  No  No?  No  I'm uncomfortable with it  And I don't think it should be done  In public like that  Some women are better at it than others  There's probably women breastfeeding all the time  I don't even notice  It's the ones that are like  Half the tit is hanging out  The kid's hanging off of it  Oh  Well, Anthony  I guess you agree with Barbara Walters today  You and Barbara  What am I supposed to find that hot, Ben? 
[02:47:30]  No  Heidi Klum?  No  Heidi Klum and Seal  Boy, if that doesn't hurt every white man in the country  You want to make the move  Go ahead  But Jesus  Do you have to picture a guy with fucking burn marks on his face?  Do you have to get our supermodels?  Jesus Christ  You tell me if Seal was an auto worker  That she'd be with him  And he got scarred in some kind of an accident when he was 14  Yeah, I was driving a fucking dodge and I hit a wall  And now I'm all scarred up  But because he's an African  And he's saying, kiss by a rose  Yeah 
[02:48:00]  He's carrying his baby  That's it  A mongrel baby  Both races will be destroyed  Alright, well let's get back to Barbara Walters here  Yeah, she's uncomfortable  So she talked about it on her show  The View  Yeah, she's on The View  You know, those four get cackling about everything  And she, I guess, let that one slide  Why could  She says that on The View  And then next thing you know  There's 150 angry moms protesting  150  Outside ABC Studios 
[02:48:30]  Well, we're  Let's make a statement  We're uncomfortable too  Right  Yeah  Damn it  And we're on 57th Street  Yeah  Between 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue  Uncomfortable  Very uncomfortable  With the breastfeeding  Yeah  And we don't like the Irish  And we'll get  Show them  Yeah  And we'll get  We'll get different results  Here it comes tomorrow  Hoping for all the protesters  We look out the window  Oh, there's nothing out there  Why?  Why can't we get the protesters 
[02:49:00]  Can I say  I'm uncomfortable with girls  Who have large clitorises  Wearing tight panties  That show them off  And standing in front of me  Yes  I hate that  What is that picture?  That is just hot  A girl  That is not hot  A girl in the shade  At the beach  On her beach blanket  And the kid is suckling  As she pulled down  She's got the bikini  She takes the bikini top off  And a moose nose  Came flopping down  And the kid is now  Making out with a moose  What's uncomfortable  About that picture 
[02:49:30]  Is the fact that  The kid looks like  He's five  He's grabbing her belly  Kids  That's just got to  Piss off dad, man  Could that kid  Got a blunder hair  She's fucking  Breastfeeding Hitler's nephew  Sorry I wasn't even listening  It stunk  And you know what's annoying  That I caught myself  Starting it  As I was walking  I said no  Let me get to the mic  So everyone can hear it  Clear as well  Oh, that kid's too old 
[02:50:00]  Look, he's giving eyes  Like, holy Jesus  Can you get these pictures  Up on opiateathlete.com  That kid is giving  Like, bedroom eyes  To the camera  Like, yep  I'm getting some titty  And there's nothing  You can do about it  That is too old  Hey, dad  Look at this  Daddy  They're mine too  Asshole  You know what makes  A woman uncomfortable  If they want to  Breastfeed on a plane  And I'm next to them  I'll just watch  And do this  Start licking your lips 
[02:50:30]  When the stewardess  Comes over  And asks you  What I want  I'll be like  Can I have  A baba  A baba  All right  Here's the story, Anthony  Lactose intolerant  Is the headline  Of course it is  Breastfeeding  And they're holding up signs  One lady held up a sign  Saying, breastfeeding  We wouldn't be here  Without it  Yeah  Nearly 150 angry moms  Babies at their breasts  Staged a peaceful  Nursing yesterday 
[02:51:00]  Outside ABC's  Manhattan Studios  In defense of  Mother's Milk, Anthony  Well, how violent  Could a nursing be?  The kid sucks their tits  They throw them  Against the window  To cause a ruckus  They take the  They take the kid  Off their boom  And start squirting  It at everybody  Swing the kid  By the feet  Get back you  Or I'll shoot  Barbara's a C word  They start chanting  It with their baby  Swing  The woman  The women  Excuse me  Self-named  Lactivists  Huh? 
[02:51:30]  What?  Lactivists  I get it  Cause of  Lactose  And their activists  Lactivists  Took to the streets  After Barbara Walters  Interview  Barbara Walters  Interview Queen  And host of The View  Made what they consider  Disparaging comments  About breastfeeding  On the talk show  Walter said  She felt awkward  Sitting with her hairdresser  Next to a woman  Who was breastfeeding  On an airplane  There you go  It made me very nervous  Walter said  She didn't cover the baby  With a blanket 
[02:52:00]  It made us uncomfortable  Ah see  She didn't cover the baby  You gotta cover that dirty thing  Don't be honest  And express the way you feel  In our society  People don't like it  Co-host Elizabeth Hasselbeck  Who was that survivor chick  Who?  She's a co-host on The View?

[02:53:30]  Who is nursing her daughter Grace  Said she was uncomfortable breastfeeding in general  Anthony  The show's host also seemed to celebrate the news  That Hasselbeck's daughter had her first bottle of formula  Spurring women in four cities to lift children to their breasts  In a synchronized milk-in yesterday  Milk-in  Just look  And it's because of lactate  Not lactose you ass  Look I'm not even going to get into it with you  What happened?  The guy  Because I said lactose  And they're lactivists 
[02:54:00]  Right  And because of lactose  But this guy says lactate  But the paper right there in front of me says lactose intolerant  And that's the whole thing  You know what?  I'm not going to argue with the listeners anymore  See that  This is the instant feedback screen  See it?  See it?  Watch what I do  I go to the upper right hand corner  Don't  I close the browser  You can't do that  Now you can  Now you  You know what?  You can't do that  If an instant feedback is posted in the forest  And no one's there to read it  Did anyone really post it? 
[02:54:30]  How about that my friends?  Now post all you want  Because now if I don't read them  It's like you never fucking posted them  Okay?  I'm punishing you all  No instant feedbacks today  But you can't do that to the rest of us  None  We enjoy the little comments that come in  But I like ones in a while  I do not pardon you  Sometimes they make us chuckle  Now I shoot you all  You can't do that to everybody  That's what happens  I close the browser  Kid left a ring around the computer  Gotta shoot him  I pardon you 
[02:55:00]  I pardon you  Alright well then we get  I love that  Then we get comments from the nursing moms there  Just look away if it's really that offensive  Said Anushka  Anushka?  Anushka?  What a hot name  Yeah  Hey Anushka  Suck it  The women carrying signs like  Mama's latte is best  Latte  Sorry  Said they worry the comments might keep new moms from nursing  Some are demanding an on-air apology 
[02:55:30]  Oh what the  Which I guarantee they'll do today  So roll tape  Cause still  I'm telling you  Alright  Here's the last instant feedback I'm reading  Wait  You already turned it off  Sweetie  No  I had like the browser up  And I was gonna close  But Pat from  Pat from Lunaki  I have to read it  He goes  I lack toe  That's very funny  Cause he's got nine toes  I lack toe 
[02:56:00]  You ass  Now I'm shutting it  It's over  No you can't  It's over  Everything with Pat comes down to a missing digit  He's gonna find an angle  Oh god  So they're demanding an on-air apology  We'll roll tape on that  Cause something stupid will happen today  I do it on the subway  I do it in the library  I do it in the park  I've never been a particularly shy person  But some people are  And they shouldn't be discouraged from doing something natural  Said Jennifer  I think the moms are right 
[02:56:30]  And Barbara Walters is wrong  I think they're right  Oh why  Cause I think that we are too repressed sexually  About stuff like that  And as long as the motives aren't to be shocking  But if you're genuinely breastfeeding  I think it's a healthy thing  And I think the first to sexualize it  Hold on  Hey did Barbara Walters say not to do it  No not at all  That's just it  Now what they want  They don't want the ability  They have the ability  To breastfeed wherever the fuck you want  Hang it out  But you're not gonna convert me  To make me feel comfortable about it  I think that Barbara Walters is a bit uptight about it 
[02:57:00]  But I also think they're overreacting  And being a bunch of annoying self-righteous twats  Demanding an apology and protest  Who gives a fuck what that irrelevant cryptkeeper says  Who cares  She's 70  Who cares  Her tits are giving cottage cheese  Nobody cares what she says  No one  No one  Alright well  Why don't we go to the phones  If you don't freaking like it  Don't look  Whatever  You know  Leslie who are you talking to  Huh  Who are you talking to  Oh I'm just 
[02:57:30]  I'm talking about Barbara Walters  And she doesn't want to see it  Are you one of those listeners  That talks to the radio  As the show is going on  Were you talking to the radio  Who were you talking to  Because we plunked the phone down  And you were already talking  Huh  We  We  We  We  We answer the  Do I have to shut the browser  For the phones too  No don't turn off my phones  We  We plunked the phone down  And picked you up  And you were already talking  I'm sorry  Who were you talking to  Who were you talking to  I was talking to y'all  Yeah but we weren't even on the phone yet 
[02:58:00]  That's like you call your mother right  And  Yeah  And it's  It's ringing  And your mom picks up  And you're already talking to her  Like do you do that  No  Not usually  See  But that's what you just did  Yeah you confused all of us  That's all  Okay well I'm a Sprint customer  So I get cut off a lot  And uh  Yeah  I talk to myself sometimes so  All right go ahead Leslie  What do you have to say  So you agree with Barbara Walters  No  Are you  Not at least it 
[02:58:30]  Are you a mom  No but I  Have taken care of children  I am close to  You breastfed children  No  Like that  No I'm  I'm a godmother  Yes  But not  An actual mother  But my whole thing is  Whatever a woman wants to do  If they want to breastfeed the kid  Whatever  If they don't  Whatever  I agree  But like Barbara Walters  Was saying  If the baby is breastfeeding  To stop it  You should curl up your fist  And punch the infant  How do you feel about that  Well whatever she wants to say 
[02:59:00]  Whatever  But if she doesn't like to see it  She just needs to look away  All right Leslie  Thank you  All right  There goes Leslie in Wisconsin  Let's go to Army  The trucker  Army  I think they fit quite nicely  In the airplane  Bathroom  Toilet  Good morning  That big head  Kind of stuck  Spinning around  But it won't go all the way down  All you see is  Five little  Five little telling fingers  Poking through  No one wants to sit down anymore  It's a killjoy 
[02:59:30]  And the worst  Yes sir  When you pick up the baby  And you go to walk to the  Walk to the bathroom  To give the baby to mom  And it tries to suck your fist  Oh really  Jesus  Maybe it ought to work out  I was going to say  You might want to join a gym  Yeah what's the matter  With you me  My ex-wife's tits  Have been destroyed  By our kids  Were they  Oh my god  It's disgusting  Oh my god  What was it like  When you first met  Your wife 
[03:00:00]  Oh  Turn on titty  I mean  Boing  Swing  What were her titties like  Describe her titties  Her titties were  Oh gorgeous  They were like  I don't know  Beautiful little dish  Yeah  One of those numbers  You know  Nice perky  Were the nipples perky  Up on top of her boobs  Oh yes  Yeah  Oh yes  Very tight  Oh and when there was  A nice cold day  And they'd poke out  I would sit there  And flick them through her shirt  And oh yeah  And now what  Now what are they like sir 
[03:00:30]  They hang down to her  Freaking belly button  It's disgusting  Does she have stretch marks  On them now  Oh yeah  Definitely Jimmy  And tell us about the nipples  They're like  They're like huge now  I mean  Full moon  And just  Creators  And the whole nine yards  Creators  Oh they're disgusting  Wow  Oh my god boys  Oh  Alright we get it  Your wife's tits are awful  Oh loves this stuff  Ex  Ex-wife  That's why  She's my ex  Well I didn't buy this  I didn't buy this 
[03:01:00]  Take care man  I'm punching out  Bye mister  There goes Army  The trucker  Eric was showing me  One of the hottest  Breastfeeding scenes  In movie history  Where?  This movie was with  The chick from  Risky Business  Rebecca De Mornay  Oh is that the hand  That rocks the cradle  What a great movie  Yeah that was a good movie  She was a real sicko  She was watching  She was like a babysitter  Like a nanny  Yeah  And she had some issues  And she decides 
[03:01:30]  She starts breastfeeding  Look at that kid  Going to town  Starts breastfeeding the kid  To the point where  The kid doesn't want  Any of mommy's milk  Yeah  And mommy doesn't  Understand why  There's a  Oh she completely  Bonded with the baby  And mommy doesn't  Understand why  There's a rejection  Issue with her newborn  And then she becomes  A psycho  A complete psycho  Wow that's pretty good  She's actually  Breastfeeding in that  Scene  Yeah  Is that her kid  Or something  How did they do that  That's a good question  Why the hell  Would you let your  Kids suck on 
[03:02:00]  Rebecca De Mornay's  Tit  For a movie  Well that's a  That's a nice mom  That's a good mom  A real sport  That's a mom  You take care of  When she goes  Into the old age home  Oh god  There's a picture  Of babies  That are a little  Too old  To be breastfeeding  It's all over  This website  Remember the time  I know we go back  A lot with this show  I mean we could  Redo it again  I don't care  We had a woman  Come in at  N.E.W.  Her kid  Someone's got to help me 
[03:02:30]  You remember her name  And everything  Wow you're good  You know her  Well stop it  Wait a minute  Can I just  Can someone smack me  In the face  Whenever I don't  Figure something out  With Jimmy  Whenever I don't  See it as plain  As daylight  Could you just  Slap me  Of course he knows her  Of course he does  She's a lunatic  And she was on our show  She was on our show  That's the prerequisite  The one who breastfed  Her 30 year old son  That one  30 year old son  Right  And the son acted  Like he was five 
[03:03:00]  Kid would suck her tits  While he's on the cell phone  We had  Making a prom date  Well  She has a name  We had Kate come in  Kate  Because we were talking  About this breastfeeding issue  And she came in with her  Come on help me out  Three and a half  Four year old  No he was older than that  Oh maybe  He was like four or five  Ben might even know  I mean it was way up there  And the kid was practically  Standing up  As he was breastfeeding  It was way too old  Way too old  He had his baseball hat on  I remember  And he was giving us  All looks as he was doing it  It was the creepiest thing  I've ever seen 
[03:03:30]  One of the creepiest things  I've ever seen in studio  Her need to feel  Loved and helpful  Kind of overrode  I thought what was good for him  But again  Maybe technically  She was okay to do it  So when you had sex with her  How was she?  Not bad  I mean I never had sex with her  Oh no  Oh okay  No  That's the baby?  Yeah  Wait what?  Eric is really good  At a lot of things  You know the baby  In Hand That Rocks the Cradle?  Yeah  That's her now  She was born in 1985 
[03:04:00]  She's now 20 years old  Holy Jesus  And hot as shit  What has she been in?  She's been in a few movies  Tell me she lists the credit  That she was the baby  In Hand That Rocks the Cradle  Oh my god  The Hand That Rocks  Wait something's wrong here  What's wrong?  Maybe Hawk  Yeah  Hawk you're wrong  Hawk stinks  You're off  You stink again  He's dumb  He's totally off  He's good in a lot of things  Let me explain  Because it's kind of funny actually  He shows me this young actress  That's about 20 years old 
[03:04:30]  Or will be 20 later this year  Okay  And goes  This is the baby from  Hand That Rocks the Cradle  So now I'm doing the math in my head  I'm like  1985 she was born  That movie was not  In the mid to late 80s  So then I looked down  And her credit list  Hand That Rocks the Cradle  Movie came out in 92  She would have had been  A 7 year old girl in the movie  Now that would have been a scene to see  I'll say  I think there was another daughter  That was in that movie  Or something like that  Yeah  Yeah  Probably  It would probably be listed as 
[03:05:00]  The baby  Or something  And that baby would be about 13, 14  He had a good thing going  You said he was really good at certain things  Yeah  And then he just kind of took it away again  Yeah I know  Why don't you tell him he's good at something  Because Eric is a very talented guy  Oh it's three  It's three children  Three children  What?  Oh she was one of three  Eric  Eric  Melender  That's odd  Jennifer Melender  And Ashley Melender  Triplets  Are they all related? 
[03:05:30]  They have to be triplets  Yeah they were  Well wait a minute  One was born  91  November 10th 91  Yeah November 10th 91  They're triplets  And that does seem to be their only acting credit  That they sucked on a booby  Not bad  Three kids  Who was the lucky one that got to suck on the booby?  The youngest probably  Let's go to San Francisco  Caitlin what's up?  Hey  I just want to call in as being one of the

[03:06:30]  Yeah the sex with the hairbrush story  Right right right  That's one of our favorite stories  What?  Well personally  I think it should be against the law  Wait do you  Let me ask you a question  What?

[03:08:00]  And I kicked my leg out  And it came out of my pants leg  Wow  And Bill remembered that for years  Was that the time  You broke your toe?  Didn't you break your toe  Or something?

[03:08:30]  To pump  To feed your child  There's no reason  To do it in public  Yeah  Absolutely none  I disagree  I don't mind it  I'm being a pervert  Yeah  It's like  We're too uptight  About stuff like that  Yeah  You know  It annoys me  So I can see  Why men get annoyed  Because I just feel  Women do it  Just to be empowered  Just to say  Oh I can do something  There's nothing you can do  It's almost playing  The race card  So  I said before  My problem with it  If the motives are right  If somebody is  Doing it because 
[03:09:00]  They genuinely  Want to feed the kid  And not to  Like you said  Not to be empowered  And just do it  Because they can  You know  What kind of an animal  Gets mad  At the mother  Breastfeeding the young  I mean  We're the only creatures  That would fucking  Have a problem with that  In the animal kingdom  It is kind of uptight  True  I mean  If there's no other option  But to do it right there  I see that  I just think it makes me  Uncomfortable  I can't look  And I don't know  Where to look  You have to look away  And then you're so conscious  That you're looking away  That you're compelled  To turn your head  And actually look 
[03:09:30]  And I don't want to be  In that situation  I'm selfish  I don't blame you  And when you see  Three or four women  Sitting together  And they're having  A tea party  With their breasts  It's annoying  What I'm saying  Is this why  Because I believe  Ant's a little bit  Uncomfortable with that  But why would  Any of us be  I'm not saying he's wrong  But that just shows you  The way we look at things  I guess as a group  It's like  Why would any of our people  Be uncomfortable  With somebody  Like nurturing the  You know what I mean  It's just a bizarre  Then why would  They be uncomfortable  If I just 
[03:10:00]  Yank it out  And start jacking  Dude  You're preaching to the choir  It's natural too  That's all natural  Alright let's go to  Brian in Chicago  Brian what's up  Hey man  I'm just saying  Whip them fuckers out  There you go  Whip them fuckers out  That's right  Someone get that t-shirt  Made immediately  Joe in Jersey  What's up  Hey what's up guys  Hey  I got a little story  Sunday afternoon  We're having a barbecue  At my girlfriend's  Mother's house  And uh  Our mother just had  A kid about a month ago  Bullshit  I swear to god  Nice dick 
[03:10:30]  So wait  I'm sitting there  Eating a hot dog  And all of a sudden  Her mother's holding  A kid  And she kind of like  Pulls down the top  Of her shirt a little bit  And I'm just  Sitting there eating  And all of a sudden  I see the kid  Just sucking on  My girlfriend's  Mother's pit  And it's just like  Everybody's eating  There's like a whole  Family there  And there's a kid  Enjoying a nice meal  And her mother  It's her mother  It's not like  It's somebody else  I don't know  And the hot dog  Told me  That it had a family  At home  Yeah 
[03:11:00]  Alright my friend  First time along Ty  Welcome aboard  We went to this website  It's like a  Breastfeeding group  Yeah  And they have 101 reasons  Why you should breastfeed  It's 101 of them  And one is that  Uh  Where is it  Oh right here  Much nicer diaper changes  Really  Oh who knew this  The bowel movements  Of breastfed babies  Smell mild and  Inoffensive Anthony 
[03:11:30]  The same cannot be said  About those of  Formula fed babies  Try changing a new  Formula fed  Wait  Try changing a few  Formula fed babies  If you're uncertain  About wanting to try  Breastfeeding  That's always good  Because you want your  Kid's shit to smell  Nice in the house  Yeah  Pleasant smelling shit  This is  This shit makes it  It goes from  Abominable to awful  Jesus  Something tells me  The formula fed shit  Isn't a real treat  It's probably better  Than the formula  But  I don't know  You mean the breastfed 
[03:12:00]  Stuff is not a treat  Yeah yeah  Thank you  Yeah  Like it's all just shit  Yeah  That's what I'm trying  To say here  It's all just shit  What you mean  You're breastfeeding  Well have the baby  Shit inside the car  I ran out of  Those little trees  Squeeze the little guy  A little potpourri  What's that  What are you  Let's go to Julie  In New York  Julie  Two eight year olds  Hanging off of that tit  They look like Brazilians  You know Eric  Why  Why encourage this  Why  Why not  Why  Hello 
[03:12:30]  Hi  Hey  What's up Julie  I'm calling  Okay I know that you think  That pregnant women  Are sexy  Which I can't believe  Not  Not  Not  Hope he does  Huh  Hope he loves them  Not all  Every once in a while  You see one walking  Around the streets  And it's like  Hey look at that  Well I'm a pregnant woman  For the second time  And there's nothing sexy  About breastfeeding  Yeah  There's nothing sexy  About being out in public  First of all  I'd never do it out in public  But you have  Infections you get  There are  Shack nipples 
[03:13:00]  Bleeding nipples  I mean it's disgusting  Why do they turn so  God damn brown  I don't know  They get huge too  I have big breasts  To begin with  Oh how big  I mean how big  30-60s  So when you get pregnant  They are the most painful things  You could possibly  Because they're just  Filled with all that  Goodness  Life giving  That life giving  Sugary juice  And you know  As much as they say  It's great for the kids  Just looking for a customer  There is nothing more than 
[03:13:30]  My husband  Let me tell you  If he could tell you  How disgusting it is  To you know  Just have to see that  As far as  Like I got  What they call mastitis  Which is infections  They're engorged  The child doesn't eat properly  Wait wait  What?  What gets infected?  You have mastitis?  It's called mastitis  Yes  An infection  That you get  From becoming engorged  Where does the infection happen?  In your breast  In your breast  So like in the  In the glands 
[03:14:00]  That make the milk  That like gets pus  No no no  There's no pus  Oh well  It just gets  They get clogged  Does it make it  Make them swell even more?  Completely swell  To the point  Where they're rock hard  They get rock hard  So what do you do with that  Besides take a pin  And fix the problem?  Penicillin  You have to take medication  Penicillin  Can you drain them?  There's got to be pus somewhere  You have to drain them  You have to  Stand in a hot shower  And physically drain them 
[03:14:30]  I'll see  There's nothing  There's nothing attractive about it  Why a hot shower?  Because it loosens everything up there Jimmy  Come on  It gets everything  Open the pores up  Gets the blood flowing  103 fever  My whole left side of my body  I couldn't move it  That's great  Have a stroke  Swollen breasts  Because you had an infected breast  Yep  Because it's the child  You're not necessarily  Every child eats properly  Off of them  So what happened  Like how does the kid  Cause that by not eating properly?  They don't 
[03:15:00]  They just don't drink enough  Enough  So you get too much milk in there  And unless you  Unless you  Milk yourself  Yep  The milk sits in there  And like  Like milk on the shelf  It's supposed to empty out  Every time they feed  Yeah you're supposed to  I don't know  Rotate the stock  Yep  Or else it gets over  The expiration date  And the container  The carton bloats  Right  It actually  I got one of those cartons  The other day  I bought milk the other day  And I put it in the fridge  And I had a little bit of milk 
[03:15:30]  Left in one carton  And I pour it out  Over my raisin bran  But there's not enough  So I open up the new carton  I just bought  And I noticed it was a little  Puffy  The carton  So I go to pour it out  It was this clear  Yellow liquid  Like piss  And then this big  Square clump  Of whatever was left  Went thawed  To the other side  Of the container  I didn't even have to say  I think this is bad  You know  It's like  Right  You just absolutely know  Did you eat  Souses  Did you eat the cereal  It was delicious  I like a viscous 
[03:16:00]  Milky yellow type of a milk  Yellow  Oh  Yeah it was  So that happens  Inside your titty  You got it  Your milk went sour  The milk goes sour  Yeah well  You know  It's been 98 degrees  All day  Alright Julie  Hang in there  Yeah  Keep your breasts  In a nice cool place  Hang in there  And we meet your breasts  There you go  I'll keep you updated  Please do  Okay  Bye  There goes Julie  Julie  Very fascinating story there  God the phones have exploded  I mean should we do some  Mayor Menino clips though

[03:24:00]  Really?  Of him speaking poorly  Mike's fight coming up  Yeah we'll get into that interview and stuff maybe tomorrow  He's 39  I can't believe he's that old  I remember when he was  No  And he was like 19  I was in rehab  And I remember Kid Dynamite was the name of the  Dynomite?

[03:24:30]  He was 20 years old  A maniac  Fuck man  The guy would  The bell would ring  He'd charge at whoever was in the ring  And knock him the fuck out  And now you know  That last fight was just an embarrassment  And this one's just going to be an embarrassment  Now it's all about him getting hurt  It's about him trying to make money is what it is  Look at all those other boxes  There's so many that are just all fucked up  Because they didn't know how to get out  Yep  So  Yeah it's a shame  Here's Tyson talking yesterday I think 
[03:25:00]  What does it mean to you?  You're about to turn 39  You're still fighting  Did you ever think you'd still be fighting at this age?  Well I never thought I'd feel this good  At 38 or 39  It's just  I don't know  Fighting is mostly psychological  In frame of mind  Physically  I have all the attributes of fighting  You know  I just have to have them psychologically  I got all the astrobutes  I got all the astronauts I need  To fight  I could go to Venus and kick ass  Because I got the astronauts 
[03:25:30]  What is he talking about?  Was he trying to say attributes?  Attributes  And what did he say?  Astrobutes  Astrobutes  Astrobutes  Astrobutes  That astro is a beaut  That's a beaut of an astro you have there  We did a great preparation for this fight  I never been to a  I started infantile  And then I moved up to more of a graduate level  It's very slow  I never worked that slowly before  I was at a stage where  I was almost embarrassed working at 
[03:26:00]  At such a small level  Come on man  I can work more than 30 seconds  I started infantile  I was beating up babies  I worked my way up  Pepper  Pepperation?  Pepperation  You need a little salt and pepperation  Before you can fight  He sounds a bit subdued  No?  Yeah  Must be the Zoloft  I take it to keep from killing y'all  One of the best lines ever 
[03:26:30]  He takes the Zoloft to keep from killing y'all  We can play the rest of these clips  And then we'll move on to Mayor Menino  Yeah  Fights June 11th in D.C.  Yeah  Who's he fight?  Who's the guy?  Another journeyman probably, right?  Really?  Steve Perry?  Oh, McBride?  No  McBride, the country singer?  What?  No  I'm thrilled and ecstatic just being here  And I've shown my performance  And I'm just so happy 
[03:27:00]  I've spent so much time with my children  And this is just  I feel like Mr. Mom in the whole bit  Man  This is beautiful  I feel like Mr. Mom  No, Mike  You're not  No, you're  He's not quite the Mr. Mom  God, how many kids does he have?

[03:28:00]  It's going to be a train wreck  We've got Pat from Munaki going to be here  Mike, at this point in your career  You're going to be 40 years old next year  Why would you pay to see you fight?  Well, yes  Regardless of what I would do to see me fight  People will see me fight  Because they know I'm a great attraction  And I'm a great entertainment  Regardless of my circumstances and my profession  He's got that right  He's an attraction  I talked about this 
[03:28:30]  So on the night of 11th of June  You want to see real Irish power  From this right hand or this left hand  White guy?  That's the guy he's fighting  He's fighting a white guy?  He sounds drunk  He's fighting an Irish white guy?  I guess, yeah  Real Irish power  They do have the black Irish though  If Tyson  Eh, whatever  There you have it  He's got to beat up the white guy  Yeah, enough of it to Tyson 
[03:29:00]  There's nothing really there  Please  Now let's go to someone  It's so bad to see him  Just kind of fade away like this  It is kind of sad  Alright, Mayor Menino  Mayor of Boston since 92 or 93  And the guy just  Is that how tall?  Is that the height difference?  Wow, this Irish guy  Is a giant  Mike isn't really that tall  Yeah, but this guy has  At least six inches on him  How big is he?  At least  At least 
[03:29:30]  Look at that  Jesus Christ  That's going to hit him in the head  I will break you  I must break you  Alright  Mayor Menino, Anthony  Mayor of Boston  Huge tongue in his head  Can't speak  Mark from Pennsylvania  Go ahead, Mark  Yeah, Opie  You're a professional broadcaster  You're talking about the way  These other guys speak  And you don't know the difference  Between I and me  I hear you say

[03:32:30]  I mean the jingle  The first jingle  Yeah we're asking for O&A jingles  This one came in today  Oh my god  The show is all over the place  I'll say  What the hell happened here  By the way  Mike Tyson is 5'11 
[03:33:00]  And this guy is 6'7 I think  72 inches makes 6 feet  Right  72 or something  Yeah  6'6  No  6'6  6'6  6'6  And 5'11  Is he undefeated or no?  Who cares  Good point  Can we get this quick news story in  I guess  While we're figuring this out  I had it  The O&B news story  Oh  I was just going to play  Another jingle  I thought you were looking for something  So I was going to jump in  With this little filler  But since we're ready 
[03:33:30]  Fuck it  That's horrible  I like it  That's an example of somebody that has  I think they're getting better  The idea that they want  I like it  But the idea of a jingle  And the actual execution of it  Done well  Miles apart  You want to add a few elements into it too  You want to do more than just our names  He's got the  You know the music there 
[03:34:00]  But then the vocals  Not quite the jingle  And what about old Jimmy Norton  You've got to include him  I want to be in a jingle  You want to be in a jingle?  I'll say  You need like harmonies  And a girl's voice in there  Do do do do do do  It's Norton and Friends  Do do do do do do  Right  Something like that  Just a thought  Got to sound happy  Let's say hi to Jeff in New York  Go ahead Jeff  Joe  Yeah  Opie  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Alright listen 
[03:34:30]  There's no such thing as black Irishmen  You know that right?  Well the black Irish  Yeah there's no such thing  No there's black Irish  They have like black hair  No no no  And they're a little darker  Yeah they're not like red hair  And Irish looking  No no no  A few years ago  The slave owners were Irish  Yeah  And then they took their name  From the Irishmen  The black people  I didn't say they were actually black black  But there's a term called black Irish  Never heard of it  Yes there is a term  And they have like darker hair 
[03:35:00]  And slightly darker features  Yeah  Alright  That's how blonde hair  Blue eyes became  Dark hair  Dark skin  Alright go ahead Anthony  Your little  Your story there  Yes  It seems in Putnam Valley  A 40 year old  Putnam Valley man  Is due in court Thursday  To answer to felony charges  Of animal cruelty  After he was accused  Of kicking his neighbor's  15 year old blind and deaf dog 
[03:35:30]  So severely  That it later died  Opie comment  Comment  Roxy  A 45 pound German shepherd  Mixed breed  Wandered into Frank Aquino's yard  During a Memorial Day barbecue  Police said  The dog died a few hours  After the attack  A witness said Aquino  Had walked over to the dog  And kicked it like a football  In the abdomen  Opie  Comment  Opie  Opie  Nothing 
[03:36:00]  The arthritic dog  Had staggered to another neighbor's yard  And died under a tree  Where owners  Lisa and William Sampson  Lisa Sampson  Found their beloved pet  And Lisa  Was quoted as saying  To viciously kick a dog  Is beyond words  Opie 
[03:36:30]  Comment  Viciously  Kick  No  Anything  After the attack  The dog  Tumbled  Several times  Then slowly  Got up  And walked away  Did it sound  Does that sound familiar  In any way  Shape or form  Barbecue  I wonder if somebody  Was having some  Prime rib at that barbecue  Perhaps the dog 
[03:37:00]  Had gotten up on the barbecue  And taken a piece  Of that prime rib  Which would give the guy  A carte blanche  To kick him  In the liver  You can't let people  Get away with this  She said  If this is what he does  To a neighbor's dog  What does he do  To strays  How does he treat people  Opie  Comment  Opie  Yeah  I see the awful  Terrible things

[03:40:00]  A spaceship  He sounds like Marion  But not as coherent  We're in constant contact  During the whole  From the  July 11th  September 11th  Event to  The last few days  We were in contact  Several times a day  On different issues  That pertain to the safety  Of the people in Massachusetts  Excuse me  Did he refer to  9-11 as  July 11  July 11  You fucking idiot  If there's one date 
[03:40:30]  I don't think anyone  Could screw up  It's 9-11  That's like  Screwing up B-Day  For World War 2  Instead of B-Day  I got it  No no  But you  That could get some crickets  I kind of like that  What a harsher response  The diversity of our classroom  Is the strength of our city  Really  But how do the language  Boundaries  The economic boundaries  I didn't hear the E part  Of that one  Economic boundaries  No I heard B-Day 
[03:41:00]  Not B-E-Day  Which I would have laughed  Why?  Because it would have been  V-E-Day  No D-Day  Oh you said D-Day?  B-Day  I thought you meant  V-E-Day  No B-Day  Instead of D-Day  I just put the wrong letter  Now it's funny again  How can we reverse  That car crash  For Pete's sake  Let's say hi to Jim  In Philly  Jim go ahead  Hi guys  Hey  Jim Norton  Yes  Can you be civil with me  During this  I'm not asking anything  More or anything less  Pretty much

[03:42:00]  That you repeat  It's getting old  It's getting sick  Give us an example  Sir why did you have to use  That kind of language  What did I say?  You said horse shit  That's offensive  Yes  Okay  Excuse me  Just because you couldn't  Come with a good comeback  Because the honesty hurts  Doesn't mean you have to  Attack me  Here's an example  You just asked me to be civil  And now you're being  Mean spirited  And don't try to  Psychoanalyze me  You're not smart enough  To do that  But go ahead  Give me an example  Okay  An example  Die in a fire  You piece of shit  That's pretty basic  That's pretty basic  And that's all Jimmy does
