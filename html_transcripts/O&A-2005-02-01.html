<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment featuring Andy Gore, a guest showcasing his bizarre collection of morbid memorabilia, including a mummified fetus, serial killer artifacts (like a Charles Manson check and letters referencing Gore), and a disturbing Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad playset.  Gore promoted his website, SatanSideshow.com. This was followed by a series of humorous news reader tryouts. Ari (an intern), DeeDee, Scott Fleischer (a producer for the new MLB channel), and Chris Barnes (formerly of a Cape Cod radio station) each took a turn, receiving varying levels of criticism and mockery from Opie, Anthony, and Jim. Barnes' more formal style received comparatively positive feedback.  Listener calls added to the comedic chaos, with one caller recounting a past encounter with Anthony at a celebrity softball game and another describing nightmares inspired by Gore's collection. The hosts also discussed their Super Bowl Sunday plans and an upcoming Mardi Gras appearance.

The show continued with a brief news rundown and traffic reports delivered by Chris Barnes, who was praised for his professionalism.  The hosts then expressed their disappointment at a lack of scheduled guests, mentioning cancellations from Jenna from Sports Illustrated and the JibJab guys. They also criticized the "gym teacher-ly" look of another absent guest.  A significant portion of the show focused on an interview with Dee Dee, host of XM Kids ("Cricket"). The conversation, initially about Dee Dee's show (including art projects and music choices), quickly devolved into crude and homophobic discussions.  The hosts and Dee Dee engaged in banter filled with homophobic slurs and jokes, speculating on the sexual orientations of various individuals, including a staff member named Steve, using derogatory language to describe his appearance and speculated sexuality. Dee Dee self-identified as a "fag hag."  The discussion included commentary on the potential "gayness" of SpongeBob SquarePants and other children's characters.  The segment concluded with the hosts promoting Dee Dee's show and scheduling information.

[02:55:00]  I don't know. I'd like to hear who else you know.  Maybe you can instant feedback some other people you know.  Or just email whoever you know to ben.sparks at xmradio.com. 
[02:55:30]  Maybe a list of people that you know or people that Ben's balls remind you of.  All right. Well, Andy, you got some other things, right?  Yeah, I got a... I guess we'll just shoot with the big one first.  It's not the Connor baby.  Oh, I remember this.  A mummified baby, right?  Yeah, this is one where the formaldehyde actually evaporated over the years.  So this used to be a pickle pong in the liquid, and the liquid's now gone, 
[02:56:00]  and you now have the little fella mummified.  Yeah, the little fella mummified.  The mummified's beautiful.  In a jar.  Yeah, I can see it from here. That's wonderful.  The head is so big, I can just picture glasses and messy hair on top of it.  That's a really, really tiny skeleton.  Yeah, and you can see the veins and everything.  Don't drop it.  I'm sorry. What's your name again?  Me.  Katie.  Katie.  Katie.  What do you think about things like that?  I think it's pretty interesting. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Interesting is one way to put it.  This is definitely interesting.  He's pretty perfectly preserved.  His little ears and everything.  It doesn't freak you out, some of that stuff at his house?  No.  Like, yeah.  The little fella's legs look like overcooked chicken wings.  Yeah.  It's baby jerky in a jar, is what it is.  The skin is mummified, still kind of on it, and you can see, yeah, you can see some muscles.  What was wrong with him?  He's got a big head or something?  No, I have no idea.  Yeah?  No idea. 
[02:57:00]  Tried to jump up the 59th Street Bridge and only went 30 feet.  They found his little body, little ears that couldn't hold the MiFi headphones.  That was kind of a showstopper right there, Andy.  It's funny how people react to this stuff.  Yeah.  You know, some people are really like...  See, that's kind of cool.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't mind that as much as what you gave me.  Like the fleshy.  Yeah, when it gets too fleshy, it's a little...  And also, the one I gave you is missing a foot.  It is?  Yeah.  What happened to that?  No idea.  Probably got caught on the hanger. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, God.  What else do you have?  Do you want to kill anyone?  No, not at all.  Oh, I'm just curious.  Nah.  Just because of the whole serial killer thing?  Nah, you know what?  There's an obsession there, and I'm wondering how far...  No, the obsession...  You go with it in your head, like...  Not at nowhere.  No?  I...  Stuff I like...  You know, I like just something weird and different.  The serial killer thing, I got kind of pegged into because I was the first guy...  Well, not the first guy, but one of the first guys to start making, like, the Manson shirts. 
[02:58:00]  It's kind of a goof, and it really took off, and that was kind of like a payday, and then  I got kind of pegged as, oh, serial killer guy.  So I'm like, hey, you know, I'll take the ball and run with it, but the money I make off  that stuff, I'll go and, you know, buy an old sideshow banner.  Stuff that I love, you know, that they're tattooed all over my arms.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I see that.  Yeah, but the problem is, is nobody wants to buy, you know, a Johnny Eck Freaks t-shirt.  Right.  They want to buy a, you know, Charlie says, fuck you, and picture Manson on it, so you 
[02:58:30]  do what you got to do.  Right on.  What else you got?  It's like show and tell, Anthony.  I know.  Show and tell.  We have another, our third news guy is warming up in the bullpen.  Oh, good.  We're going to have one more news guy.  Hey, Andy Tudor from London, England, checking in.  Hey, my name's Andy, too.  Hey, Andy.  Ooh.  So he's checking in with that.  He's got the same name as you.  Wow.  Cool.  Andy.  There we go.  Very good.  What a great instant feedback that is.  Yeah.  I got a lot of email from the show yesterday at home. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, for one of the guys from the Gigi's band wrote me.  Really?  Yeah.  He was listening?  Yeah, he was from the Jabbers.  Okay.  I think his name was Chris.  Very cool guy, and he also knew Johnny Ramone, too, so.  Yeah, someone wants to know if you have anything from the Wonderland Murders.  No.  No?  Okay.  Carlos from Metuchen is saying,  Anthony, at your last celebrity softball game in Newark, I got my girlfriend to show 
[02:59:30]  you her cans.  I also called out to little Jimmy at right field and told him he stinks.  Remember?  Yeah.  That was the guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He yelled, you stay.  He's checking in now.  I was in right field.  Yeah, yeah.  Checking in.  It's funny.  I was just talking about him.  I was kind of hoping he'd check in.  Thanks for it.  Yeah.  Thank God.  Yeah, good man.  Let's go to line six.  This guy, Julio, from Florida.  He had nightmares last night because of Andy Gore.  Cool.  Julio.  Yo.  What's going on, buddy?  What's up, fellas?  What's up? 
[03:00:00]  You hear the delay?  Anyone else hear that delay?  Go ahead, Julio.  You guys, man.  People click?  No good.  I had nightmares.  I had nightmares of this crap, man.  It was terrible.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks, Julio.  All right.  He had nightmares.  Okay.  Well, thank God you're all right.  Yeah.  We can't really go to the phones today because the delay is...  We didn't have that yesterday, I don't think.  Thank you.  Perfect.  Andy, you got anything else for us today or that's about it? 
[03:00:30]  Well, I went ahead and bought a whole...  I have so much crap at home, but I pretty much brought this to show you guys when you're  off the air, but this is all...  I bought a whole true crime collection.  There's stuff in here, all the Gacy stuff and the Speck stuff.  Like a whole bunch of original G.G. Allen letters and drawings from prison.  I'm going to be selling a bunch of this stuff in about a month on the website.  Oh, I see like some kind of medical thing in there.  Oh, that's one I'm keeping.  It's a Jack Kevorkian autograph on a medical chart. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, isn't that great?  How do you get that?  I deal with a lot of weird collectors and the guys have...  Jack Kevorkian autograph.  Wow.  I got Richard Ramirez letters to various people and one actually mentions me in the letters.  Really?  Yeah.  It's like talking about you to other people?  Yeah.  He just said, yeah, I know Gore and that was it.  That's creepy.  Yeah.  And a bunch of G.G. Allen stuff that he wrote. 
[03:01:30]  No feces on that, right?  I hope to God.  Well, it's in plastic so I can overwrite the OCD.  Very good.  Yeah.  I'd be a little frightened to grab anything that G.G. had his hands on.  Yeah.  What else do I got here?  Like mugshot thing?  You know, Manson autographs.  Manson ended up getting a banking account outside of prison somehow.  Get out of here.  Yeah, and it was like this huge scandal because the prison totally fucked up. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, man.  It's got a blank check with Charles Manson's name on it.  Let me see.  It looks like Monopoly money, though, or something.  A Monopoly check.  That's a real check, though.  And what the address here is, the prison?  The prison, yeah.  CSP, California State Penitentiary or something.  Yeah, look at that.  What year is it?  No year on it.  Not dated.  That's a pristine, unused Charles Manson check. 
[03:02:30]  That's pretty wild.  There you go.  All right, Andy.  Always a pleasure, man.  Okay, it was great to be here, guys.  Definitely.  Yeah, well, I mean, we're just saying goodbye for the air, but hang out and do the rest of the show with us.  We might bring you back on there.  Cool.  All right.  Are you sure this is not a goof?  No, I mean, I have a newspaper article about it at home to back it all up with.  All right, what's the plug?  Sideshow?  SatanSideshow.com.  Yeah, SatanSideshow.com if you want to check out what Andy Gore is all about.  Okay? 
[03:03:00]  Cool.  When we come back, we're going to have our third newsman.  Yeah, he just had to go write copy.  Well, he's ready.  He's going to write a little copy.  He's ready to go.  Which guy are we using?  We're using Scott, who's working on the baseball channel he wants to try out.  What's his full name?  Major League Baseball.  Scott Fleischer.  Why the...  Why the what?  Yeah.  You were kind of snoring during your breathing there.  Maybe because of...  What's her name?  DeeDee.  You're the only guy that has awake apnea.  How does that happen?  Ben's just standing there and he's going...  Yeah, he's going to wake up. 
[03:03:30]  Steve's giggling a lot today because we really haven't picked on him and he's really enjoying  everyone else getting goofed on today.  No, it's funny.  We didn't even tell the story about how Steve and I were walking around and we ended up  at the gay police department the other day.  The two of us.  The gay police department.  What's that about?  No, I don't think...  Well, we went and we were looking and we were trying to get directions and we went and  it said...  What did it say?  The gay and...  Gay and lesbian activism unit or something like that.  But it was a police...  It was a police office.  It was a gay and lesbian liaison unit or something like that, but it was a branch of one of these 
[03:04:00]  municipal police departments and we happened to...  Do they handle gay issues or are they gay police?  We rang the doorbell.  They never answered.  They never answered.  We couldn't interview them at the time, so...  But it was a big sign.  Having sex with each other.  Of course, they're not answering the door.  Look at us, though.  So, you know, they probably thought, you know, if they answered the door...  With the flaming shirt, yeah.  Come on in.  Hit my big bear over there.  Justin Volpe's picture, employee of the month.  All right, well... 
[03:04:30]  We'll take a very quick break and we'll get our third newsman in here in just a bit.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program broadcast live from Washington, D.C.  Live from Washington, D.C.  On this day prescribed by law and marked by ceremony,  we are led to one conclusion.  This place just blows.  You're being harsh.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  It's M202.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  What the hell is that? 
[03:05:00]  We're back with the O.N.A. virus.  On channel 202.  High voltage.  High voltage.  Andy Gore just, I don't know, he pulled out some kind of game.  It's a toy.  A play set.  A play set.  Yeah, I also collect weird and strange toys that people think are normal,  that I think are just fucked up.  And this one is the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad play set. 
[03:05:30]  Come on, that's got to be a fake.  No, no, no.  It's a slavery play set.  It's like a McFarland toy.  Look, on the back we have the black teacher showing the Aryan little white girl.  Yeah.  And you open it up, and it has little figures of the slaves running.  It has a bloodhound.  They have a, you know, and this is all for education.  There's a little plantation house.  A little plantation, a little barbecue chicken, a little banjo. 
[03:06:00]  A horse and buggy.  And if you take a look at their faces, they're horrified like a mother clutching the young.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, and it even comes with...  That's so weird.  It even comes with wanted posters for runaway Negro men.  Wow.  And this was put out by an education organization.  What's the name of it?  The Good Old Days Collection?  Yeah.  And it was put out by Child Light, and I saw this, and I was like, I can't believe that. 
[03:06:30]  So, of course, the company's long out of business, but I found a guy that had a bunch of them.  So I said, how many you got?  I'll take them all.  And it just goes along perfectly with the Jeffrey Dahmer play set that I make that I'm going to give to Martini Steve to give away to a Lucky Lister.  Wow.  And that is a Jeffrey Dahmer doll.  And you unzip him, and there's a Cleotus inside of him.  And, oh, yeah, this is a signed piece. 
[03:07:00]  And this actually was on the John Walsh show.  They had their Murderabilia special.  Murderabilia.  And this was the most gauche, the most crass thing ever produced.  And I probably handmade about 35 of them.  You know, and the Adam Walsh bobblehead doll seems a little more crass than that.  That's funny.  Hat and torso not included.  You go to tip it to bobble it.  Oops. 
[03:07:30]  Falls off.  That's pretty wild.  All right.  Yeah, Steve will do something with that on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah, I also sent Steve some pictures last night when I was staying up all night of the Siamese twins with the wow sticker next to them.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's a beautiful...  Because you never really wanted us to have any of that on our website in the past.  Well, now that I've moved, it's fine.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Nice.  Cool.  So the Siamese twins with the diapers that we were talking about yesterday, we're going to have a picture up on foundrymusic.com? 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you've got to see this thing, man.  This is terrific.  I'd rather see their large genitals.  Steve will have that up on the website when he gets the picture and gets back to New York, I guess.  Hey, why don't we try out our third news guy for today, Anthony?  Yeah.  This is going to be an ongoing thing on the program as we try to find someone to do the news.  Well, Elo, we had a meeting with him yesterday, and he thought it would be a good thing for us to have a news person on our show that can go through the headlines in a serious fashion, and then we can comment on the news. 
[03:08:30]  Who did we have today, Randy?  Ari, who claimed to be something he's not.  He's pretty much an intern.  He was a news sports guy.  I give him credit for trying.  We learned he doesn't even have a desk here at XM.  No.  And then we had, of course, DeeDee, who will be a star in our program in the future.  DeeDee and her voice.  Her voice and her laugh snort.  Can we get her back on the air before we get off? 
[03:09:00]  We have to get her on one more time.  All right, good.  And now we've got Scott.  Yes, that's me.  What's your last name?  Fleischer.  Fleischer?  And what do you do for XM?  Well, I'm a producer for the new baseball channel.  Oh, right on.  Which starts in 15 days, Anthony.  Major League Baseball.  Because Elo has that whole countdown thing on the outside of his office.  I was just looking at his Lindsay Lohan picture, so I really didn't see anything else around his office.  It's got that signed Lindsay Lohan photo.  Looking really hot, by the way.  With her shirt all unbuttoned and her cleavage showing. 
[03:09:30]  And yeah, it was wonderful.  Right next to Lindsay is the baseball.  Oh, it is?  Oh, really?  No.  Didn't even notice.  I'm surprised he doesn't just have a list of how many days old Jackson will be when baseball starts.  Everything going back to Jackson with Elo.  Of course.  Every single day.  Enough with the baby.  Be a man.  All right, so I guess we'll just hit the teletype and listen to Scott do the news for the Open Anthony program.  Well, I'd like to know what he does.  You know, what do you do on air?  Yeah, yeah, do some on air stuff.  Started in traffic and weather with Didi. 
[03:10:00]  Didi's a star, bro.  Didi's a star, no doubt.  Didi's a star.  Lover.  And then I do some college sports stuff with Ari.  He really does do some sports stuff.  Yeah.  He looks dejected in there.  You all right, bro?  He's just hiding his head.  He's coming back in here real fast.  You all right, Ari?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Go ahead.  I'm very sensitive.  No, no, I'm fine, no.  I actually do do sports stuff, and if it wasn't for him, I would have probably been on your list. 
[03:10:30]  For real.  Been on your list on Andy's list.  Oh, serial killer?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  I'm getting there, man.  You all wound up?  Yeah.  They run me like a house slave.  I might be in that...  In the play set.  I could be in the play set.  All right.  Ari, Ari.  I don't know what's going on, but...  I like it.  We got potential killers here.  Ari, the house slave.  That's what he goes by.  Yeah.  The house Hebrew slave. 
[03:11:00]  Hebrew slave.  All right, Ari.  Very good.  Thank you.  There's Ari.  He tried out for the news earlier.  Is that good enough?  You want...  Didn't quite make it.  Cut it.  You want to hear Scott do the news now, or...  Sure.  All right.  Here's Scott Fleischer.  Scott Fleischer with the news.  All right.  Let's listen.  All right.  We start with Michael Jackson in some trouble today, of course, as always.  His trial is beginning.  And in Santa Barbara...  Santa Maria, California, we take you to the Michael Jackson trial.  And Jackson began the trial yesterday. 
[03:11:30]  Showed up smiling as fans were there.  A hundred fans there.  And onlookers.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Jim's making faces.  Jim.  Jim.  It's just...  Not that it's...  It just doesn't sound very...  And you were trying to hide.  You looked at Ant and I.  Made faces.  I was keeping my head down.  He couldn't want to distract him.  He couldn't see the faces you were making.  I didn't want to distract him.  And then you turned your mic like this to get your...  And then he wouldn't know where he went.  And I didn't want to distract him because he's doing...  It was more like this.  But he was doing...  I don't want to distract him because he's doing his newscast.  And I don't want to be...  What's the problem with the newscast? 
[03:12:00]  It just didn't sound very official.  Wow.  We're going to...  Kind of sounded very relaxed.  Like, hey, man.  But he's still more of a personality type of newscast.  Really?  Like he's just discussing it.  Right.  I thought that's what we were looking for.  Yeah.  I thought that's what we were looking for.  I kind of liked his style, Jimmy.  All right.  Well, let's...  Sort of a Dennis Miller weekend update delivery.  Yeah.  It was different.  It was like...  Instead of a Walter Cronkite.  He was including us all in in the newscast.  You're saying he was kind of like changing the tone to kind of fit the vibe of the show.  Exactly. 
[03:12:30]  And I was waiting for a Norton comment.  Right.  I was kind of trying to play.  You were a little...  I wouldn't interrupt you.  That's rude.  You had...  You were kind of monotone.  I think it's kind of a...  It's kind of one of those, hey, guys, here's what's happening, by the way, Michael Jackson.  But I don't know if that's what we're looking for, sir.  Quite frankly, I think we're looking for an official news...  I don't know.  We haven't even heard him.  We haven't even heard him yet.  We heard enough for Jimmy to go...  No.  Oh, yeah.  But I tend to prejudge.  I'm a bit of an ass.  And this show is called Norton and Friends, so I guess you're done. 
[03:13:00]  No, no, no.  Let's not be so harsh like two sidekicks.  Let me see if...  Can we give him a shot or what?  Another day in court.  Yes, of course.  All right, let's give him a shot.  Start over there.  Scott Fleischer with the news on the O.P. and Anthony program.  This is Scott Fleischer with the news on the O.P. and Anthony program.  Well, wrong name for the program.  It's Norton and Friends.  Go ahead.  This is Scott Fleischer with the news on the Norton and Friends show.  Today in the news, Michael Jackson appears in court as jury selection is underway in Santa Barbara, California.  Fans appeared yesterday in the courthouse and welcomed Jackson to his trial. 
[03:13:30]  News from the Pentagon as President Bush is now going to raise the money given to victims' families from the Iraq war.  He says he will increase the donations to $250,000 in government payments to families of U.S. troops killed in Iraq.  I kind of like so far, I like the way that all...  Can I compliment the guy?  I was a little harked before.  I like the way he's reading every word individually as opposed to in a flow.  I like four of the teens have pleaded guilty, which I like. 
[03:14:00]  Go ahead.  I like it.  It's called a William Shatner delivery.  I like it.  It's very, very deliberate.  You could shop any word and paste it somewhere else.  Right.  Hillary Clinton also in the news today.  Clinton fainted yesterday at a speech in Buffalo at Canisius College.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  What happened?  Oh, Pete.  What?  I didn't do that.  I'm listening.  The news ticker stopped.  Oh, what happened, though?  He threw his hands up in the air like he was going to hit somebody. 
[03:14:30]  What happened?  I don't know.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station just in big capital letters, NEXT.  Wait.  There's no satisfying these people.  What was wrong with Scott?  What happened?  Oh, wait.  Rev just, by the way, sent in instant feedback that he knows a guy named Scott.  Wow.  Well, let's get that out there, then.  Thank you, Rev.  Scott, why are the hands up in the air?  I don't know.  I'm just confused.  I'm a little confused.  Oh, you're right.  You know, I'm trying different vibes here.  Right.  First, the kind of conversational thing.  Then I try the straight-up newscast thing. 
[03:15:00]  I kind of like the straight-up newscast.  So do I.  I enjoyed it.  Okay.  Pay no mind.  Norton's the only one that has a problem with it.  I didn't have a problem with it.  I would have said it had a problem with it.  I kind of like it.  No.  You really don't tell people to their face that they have a problem with it.  I'm not saying I do, but I would have hinted.  I'm sure as soon as he leaves the studio, you'll have a lot to say.  Absolutely not true.  So why don't you say it to him now?  I absolutely will not.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  All right.  All right.  The Hillary Clinton thing.  Oh, Hillary Clinton?  Yes.  I was kind of done with it. 
[03:15:30]  I'm Scott Flesher with the news on the Norton and Friends program.  Hillary Clinton's veined yesterday as she was giving a speech in Buffalo at Canisius College,  but she's okay now.  Snoop Dizzle in the news today.  Snoop is being sued by a woman.  Snoop?  Snoop Dizzle?  Snoop Dizzle.  That's like Snoop Dogg only using his...  Dizzle thing?  Vernacular.  Yeah, his vernacular, which would be Snoop Dizzle.  Right.  Snoop Dizzle.  Snoop Dizzle accused of a sizzle. 
[03:16:00]  All right, well, let's see how it goes.  Snoop Dizzle accused of a sizzle today as Snoop is being accused of raping a woman at  the Jimmy Kimmel Show.  Right.  There's the news.  It's not that simple, though, is it?  No, there's a little more to it.  All right, there's more to the story than that.  Snoop is being sued by a woman who claims that she was drugged and raped backstage at  the Jimmy Kimmel Show.  Oh! 
[03:16:30]  Yeah?  More news?  No, I think that'll do it.  That's good.  We haven't even gotten to sports yet.  Yeah, we haven't.  No one has done sports yet today, Anthony.  That's true.  All right.  And this is his expertise.  Maybe he could be a sports expert.  He's going to be working on the Major League Baseball channels, and I think we should hear  some sports today.  The Super Bowl is only a few days away, right?  I'm sure you've got a Super Bowl story.  Yeah.  All right.  In sports today, preparations for the Super Bowl are underway.  And in Jacksonville, Terrell Owens went through his first practice yesterday with the Philadelphia 
[03:17:00]  Eagles.  His first full practice since injuring his ankle eight weeks ago.  I'm Scott Pleasure with the news on the Norton and Friends show.  I'm done, guys.  All right.  All right.  You can stop the ticker now.  I'm finished.  I'm finished.  That was good.  What did everybody think?  Let's go to Andy Gore. 
[03:17:30]  Andy?  My schnizzle, my nizzle.  Yeah.  You're a faithful listener of the program.  What do you think?  Does he have potential to do the news on the show?  Yeah.  You didn't ask Katie?  I thought he did just fine.  Just fine.  Just fine.  Anthony?  Oh, me?  All right.  Are you going to make him just walk away?  That's my answer. 
[03:18:00]  Scott, just take off the headphones and take your newscast.  Thank you for trying out.  We'll be in touch.  But if you're playing this music, we're not going to be in touch.  We're never in touch after we play this music, Anthony.  Just the sad Hulk walking away music.  I just think it's appropriate that...  There you go.  Thank you very much.  This is very awkward, Anthony. 
[03:18:30]  It's a little awkward.  Maybe he doesn't really understand the Hulk music.  He might be taking it a little too personally.  There he goes.  Oh, he's shaking his head.  Why is he choking Martini Steve now in the other room?  I don't think he was that bad.  I kind of like the speak and spell diction delivery.  Wow, you're so brave when he's not in here.  Why?  He's right there.  He's looking at me.  He's the bravest guy.  Is it the door open?  You want to lock it before you tell him what you think of him?  I thought he was fine. 
[03:19:00]  Right.  All right.  Fine.  And in sports, our search continues for a news person for the program.  The news from where no man has gone before.  Man.  Yeah?  Okay.  We just got to keep looking.  Yeah?  Elo, you know, he's got the idea.  I think if we find the right person, it's going to work just perfectly.  We just have to.  We can't, you know, we can't make conclusions too quickly here. 
[03:19:30]  We've got to find somebody and it'll be fine.  Elo and the tripod method.  The tripod method of attacking a story.  Yeah, what was the tripod thing he was talking about yesterday?  Well, I think it's that like when he's telling you, you stand on a tripod and put a rope over a pipe and then hang yourself before the end of the story.  It's the long, it's the tripod meaning three.  Yeah.  Ah, you were done.  The first part of the story would be what?  Ben, what was the first part of the story?  Hopefully you remember that was done for you.  Ben's going through his nose.  Ben has no memory. 
[03:20:00]  I do have a memory.  The beginning is the story and then the second part of it is the expert and then the third part of it would be the listeners.  Good.  There you go.  And that makes the tripod.  Yes, it does.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, the tripod was really interesting.  You weren't there for the tripod, Barry.  He's saying every story has three legs to it as opposed to buckets.  Now there's legs.  Legs.  The first part is just the story.  Uh-huh.  And then I guess we comment on it and Josh about it and then the second part is the expert.  Yeah, then the story kind of gets boring because you're talking about it a little too much. 
[03:20:30]  And then to pump new interest into the story, you get the expert.  The expert.  So then the expert.  Oh, oh, expert.  So you as a listener, listen up.  Oh, expert.  Expert about Michael Jackson.  I was just dozing, but expert.  And then the expert gets, you know, long-winded and boring after a while.  And then like, well, let's get some phone calls and your reaction to the Michael Jackson thing.  And that piques a new interest.  And the fourth one is, oh, baby Jackson.  Baby Jackson.  Well, that's actually a good idea because if we take a story as far as it can go and begin to bore people, 
[03:21:00]  let's bring a professional in who I'm sure will be fascinating to listen to.  And then allow the listeners to call in with such comments like Rev would say,  I once heard a Michael Jackson song and other poignant things like that.  Right, right.  So very, very happy that we had that meeting yesterday.  This trip is working out so well.  That's right.  As far as getting us, getting these meetings done and getting input for our show.  When he was saying tripod, I thought he was describing Ben without jeans.  Ben?  First leg is gravy. 
[03:21:30]  Ben?  Yes.  Anything?  What do we got left in this awful program?  Well, DeeDee's coming back in a moment.  Okay.  And Megan's running in with a note very excited.  Oh, we have another guy.  We have another guy.  This guy, I've heard, is very good.  Another traffic, another news guy.  His name's Chris Barnes.  Everyone's saying that this guy could be the guy.  Could really?  Could be the guy?  Could be the guy.  Is he ready to go or should we take a break and then try out a fourth news person?  Wow.  Maybe they could go.  Maybe they could give us, he could give us some stories that we haven't heard yet. 
[03:22:00]  It's the same news stories over and over again.  All right.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Make no mistake about it.  These are evil doers.  Yes.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Live from Washington, D.C.  They have no justification for their actions.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  This is evil.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  We're almost done with the show, Anthony, from Washington, D.C. 
[03:22:30]  At the XM Compound.  Let's not forget we're going to be live at Mardi Gras Monday and Tuesday, February 7th and February 8th from 3 to 6 p.m. Eastern time at the Crazy Horse on Bourbon Street right on the balcony.  It's going to be a lot of fun, so if you're hitting Mardi Gras, make sure you check us out.  Yes, Ben?  And Tom has invited all of us to his house for Super Bowl Sunday. 
[03:23:00]  Great.  Yeah, Tom from New Orleans.  We'll talk to him hopefully tomorrow on the program.  He wants us to drink moonshine or something.  He's cooking crawfish.  You've got to cook crawfish.  He's got to know who's coming.  Crawfish, and we're going to have some moonshine there for you.  He wants Norton to come.  He wants to make sure Norton comes.  No, drink some moonshine.  Yeah, we have no place to watch the Super Bowl,  so he's inviting us to his crib where he'll be drinking moonshine and cooking up some crawfish.  I've actually heard that Tom's place is pretty nice. 
[03:23:30]  Are you doing that on purpose to drive me nuts?  No, I'm not.  I can't.  I just creaked it.  Uh-huh.  That was Ant.  Okay.  See, we had that problem fixed in New York.  Yeah, we greased our poles.  I move this a lot.  That's the way I do it.  I've got to keep adjusting it and the thing keeps flopping around.  All right.  I forgot what we were going to say.  Blah, blah, blah.  New Orleans.  Oh, New Orleans.  Super Bowl.  Super Bowl, yeah.  No, we were talking about where to watch this.  Tom Climes everywhere is sold out, too.  There ain't nowhere to watch it in New Orleans.  You don't have to come over to Tom's house. 
[03:24:00]  How about the hotel room?  Yeah.  I'd rather stay in my hotel room and watch it.  We'll get like one room.  Everyone will come over.  Maybe Opie's room.  We can make it feel like his house.  We'll throw out all the furniture, have no food,  and have rats running around.  And we'll just watch the game there.  It's not that bad.  Watch vermin crawl over our chips and pretzels that we had to bring.  It's not that bad.  Light a java log because there's no fireplace.  Just put it on the floor so the smoke fills.  Call the fire department.  Sure, like the old days. 
[03:24:30]  A little wine.  All right.  Let's get the next news guy in.  Oh, and then we have to do meetings after this?  This is really going to be bad meeting day.  We've got to talk to the CEO of the company,  and then we also have to talk to Gary Hahn in marketing.  This better happen quickly after the show.  Quickly.  Good point, Ant.  I have to still go back to the hotel, check out,  and then we've got to get to the train.  We saw Gary Hahn and his staff, Norton and I.  Elo was taking us around yesterday,  and there was a lot of uncomfortable nodding going on. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, that I acknowledge your existence now?  Barely.  I think they're taking everything we've said about them personally at this point.  They didn't recognize us.  We're like, hey, who are you guys?  Me and Anthony.  And they're like, oh.  And Jim had something to say about them behind their back.  You're the worst, dude.  Of course I am.  Hey, man, you see that ghoulish looking one?  I didn't say he was ghoulish.  Awful.  I said goulash.  I'd like to eat some goulash.  Yeah, sure you did. 
[03:25:30]  It kind of popped out from behind the,  there's like a little area they're all kind of just sitting,  talking, and then the real tang guy just kind of steps out.  It's kind of creepy.  Hey, hello.  Welcome.  Anthony.  Welcome.  In the studio, another potential news person.  Yes.  Now, you look like a professional news guy.  Yeah, I have been.  You have been?  Have been, yeah.  What do you do now for XM?  Traffic.  Traffic.  Yeah.  A lot of people working in the traffic department.  Yeah.  I do Boston, Dallas, and Seattle. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, Boston.  Good old Boston.  Yeah, good old Boston, huh?  Just give up.  Leave your car and shoot yourself in the head.  And where did you do the news?  I've done it here at an earlier time,  station that came and went, USA Today channel a while back.  Fifteen years on Cape Cod.  Wow.  Market 189.  What station on Cape Cod?  WPXC was the call letters.  Yeah.  It was a rocker.  Of course, the nickname wouldn't give you that idea,  because it was called Pixie 103. 
[03:26:30]  Have you ever heard of it?  Pixie?  Pixie.  Yeah, I think I've heard of it.  I think I sent a demo tape to that station back in the day.  Market 189?  Yeah.  Yeah.  On a good day.  On a good day.  Wasn't there a program director named Dennis Sandwich or something?  Dennis Harwich.  Harwich.  Harwich Sandwich.  Took his name off an exit sign on Cape Cod.  Dennis W. Harwich.  As a matter of fact, you had to say W.  Yeah, I had to write that out to demo tape to the PD,  who was this guy Dennis,  and then I'm going actually for an interview,  and I see the exit sign like that son of a bitch. 
[03:27:00]  That's where he got his name.  Took it from the exit sign.  Because it shows the two towns, Dennis and Harwich.  And West Harwich, yeah.  Dennis W. Harwich.  I would have been there then,  because I was there from like 87 until last Tuesday.  All right, so it's Chris Barnes, Anthony,  trying out to be the news person on our program.  All right.  Let's go right to the teletype.  Did you say trying out to be or trying not to be?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right, we'll put the news hat on here.  All right.  All right, leading the news out of Baghdad, Iraq, today. 
[03:27:30]  Iraq's president said today it would be complete nonsense  to ask foreign troops to leave the country now,  although some could leave by year's end.  Officials began the final vote tally from elections  to produce a government to confront the insurgency.  And meanwhile, Iraq reopened its borders yesterday.  Commercial flights are taking off again  from Baghdad International Airport.  I want to apologize.  Why the ick?  I don't know.  Why'd you ick?  No, you ick.  No, I think it's actually very good.  Jimmy had another comment.  I thought you were doing a good job. 
[03:28:00]  I was actually interested in the Baghdad Airport  reopening to commercial traffic story.  Yeah.  And Jimmy completely took me out of it.  That's not true.  I think he's very official, actually.  I like it.  This is the first guy that actually has a news voice.  I know.  That's why I like him.  So what's the problem with him?  I have no problem with him.  On the replay, everyone will hear you say,  ugh, you can't get away with it.  Please.  God, it's actually very good.  And the awful look he gave him  while he was looking down at his eye.  Are they going to hear that in the replay?  I'm actually not giving him an awful look.  I'll look this way, and I'm listening.  All right.  Pick up with a little lighter story, baby. 
[03:28:30]  Out of Los Angeles.  Wait, now he sounds disgusted.  Did we hurt your feelings?  No.  Oh, no, not at all.  No, I didn't do anything.  I did nothing.  Why would I hurt his feelings?  You've got thicker skin than that.  Yeah.  All right.  Don't test me, though.  Cable TV powerhouse HBO has agreed to sell rerun rights  for its hit mob drama, The Sopranos,  to the A&E Cable Network.  It's a deal that industry sources put at a record 2.5 million an episode.  It's more than you guys get.  The acquisition, which A&E said on Monday had been agreed to in principle, 
[03:29:00]  marks the biggest per episode sum ever paid for off-network distribution  of an existing TV series.  The deal covers 65 episodes from the show's final five seasons  and 10 to 13 additional hours from a sixth season that recently went into production.  You know, this is also, this is what we call rip and read.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know, reading a Peacocky is like...  Yeah.  But...  This guy's actually very good.  He's read the news before. 
[03:29:30]  I want to hear more.  Should I keep going?  The sound effects are gone.  Do I want to talk to him?  No, you've got to have the news thing.  You've got to have the sound effects.  Why?  So it can hide all the remarks you're making under your breath?  That Jimmy is making under his breath?  Dude, that's the way news is done.  All right.  All right.  A bar in Manitoba that once considered to be among the toughest in Western Canada for fights  will soon be serving coffee and juice...  Will it?  ...instead of beer and booze.  I got you that time.  I got you that time.  I heard it. 
[03:30:00]  What?  Will it?  Very sarcastically.  Is that your comment?  Will it?  I so got you.  I turned it off perfectly.  I didn't say that he wrote it.  What I was saying was that, like, will it?  Because all of a sudden, now it's not serving what it used to be, serving.  It's serving something different.  But that's not how you comment on the news.  It is.  No, it's not.  What's wrong with that?  I like so far what he's doing very much.  I like the story about the Sopranos.  I liked it very much. 
[03:30:30]  What's wrong with how he says Sopranos?  Nothing.  Chris, I'd punch him.  I like Chris.  He's terrific.  The new owner of the new Occidental Hotel says he plans to work with an aboriginal group  to offer entertainment and employment services in the building that his bar, however, will  be alcohol-free.  He says, quote, there will still be bars in the area for those who want to drink.  And another story out of Washington.  Under pressure from lawmakers for better treatment for U.S. forces serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
[03:31:00]  the Pentagon says it's going to increase survivor benefits for families of service members  killed in the war, according to a Pentagon official on Monday.  The proposed increase would effectively double to $500,000, the amount that survivors receive  in government payments and life insurance benefits, according to the Washington Post.  And that's really the news.  All right.  I like it. 
[03:31:30]  You've liked everyone, Anthony.  Can't you have an opinion?  No, I thought he was very professional, very concise.  So he'll start tomorrow?  Wasn't confusing at all.  So he'll start tomorrow?  We'll get back to him.  We'll get back to him.  I'm right down the hall.  Traffic booth one.  Traffic booth one.  If you're looking for me.  Boston traffic.  In Seattle?  Yeah.  And Dallas-Fort Worth.  In Dallas.  Wow.  They're all over the place.  How's traffic in Boston today?  Traffic in Boston is okay now. 
[03:32:00]  Dallas, it's coming apart at the seams.  Really?  Yeah.  What seems to be the problem?  People driving around Dallas-Fort Worth, and it's not a good thing.  They're really bad drivers down in Dallas.  Well, when it rains, you know, I'll be looking at the screen there, and in one minute it's fine,  next minute the rain starts, and you know it, because about three dozen accidents, you know?  Dude, I'm going to call and tell me a guy, and it's raining, and, like, the guy in front  of us is riding the brake lights, and he's going, look at him riding the brake lights.  I'm like, would you look at him? 
[03:32:30]  Okay.  All right.  Comment?  I'm not, I don't know.  I feel like I kind of joined that in progress.  No, but he knows what I'm saying, though.  It's the way it is.  Oh, yeah.  Of course, it's traffic, man.  It's like, yeah.  Yeah.  That's what he meant.  All right.  He got you.  Let's hear it for Chris Barnes.  Very good job.  Thank you, guys.  Very good job.  Very professional. 
[03:33:00]  I like that.  It sounded good.  Very good.  I'll see you.  Thank you for coming in.  All right.  You're the first guy that got that, by the way.  A little more traffic.  Chris Barnes was the first one to get it.  He was the first one to get it.  No, don't.  That's just his gag.  Wow, you nail everyone with that dumb gag.  I ate Jim, by the way.  I would not go by Chris's department after the show.  Why?  I do not think Chris liked Jim.  Why?  I don't know.  Yeah.  And then you just get him like that?  Megan's like, you were really, really good. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  Look at her kissing ass.  What's this in front of us?  I don't know what this means.  Oh, maybe it's...  All right.  Oh, that was Chris's name.  I think he did a great job.  He was good.  Yeah, he was very official.  Yeah.  I liked him.  He does Boston traffic.  How can you not like him?  Oh, Boston.  Okay, are we ready for Dee Dee?  Dee Dee's coming back.  What happened to all our guests?  They gave up on us.  We had Jenna, the Sports Illustrated cast off.  Yeah, a lot of people, I don't know.  A lot of people...  We had the gang from JibJab. 
[03:34:00]  He had a gym teacher-ly look to him, didn't he?  He really did have the gym teacher-ly look to him.  Yeah, very, very sweatsy.  He was like a big bulldog on the upper half.  He had a big upper torso.  Yeah.  Thick fingers.  And he was wearing the XM identification thing, and it looked like a whistle.  Yeah.  So it definitely looked like he was a gym teacher, and he was going to beat up Jimmy.  I don't know why.  I was rooting for him to do well.  I thought he was...  You were being a bastard.  I was not.  He was very...  Oh, groaning.  Oh, shut up.  Enough. 
[03:34:30]  I heard you.  Enough already.  Fine.  Fine.  Shut up.  No Bob Edwards?  No, he's very busy.  We're going to get...  We'll get...  Next time we're down here.  Next month...  What about the...  Where is he?  What about the wonkette?  I don't know what happened to her.  Who is she?  She's like a political writer here in Washington.  Why did everyone blow us off today?  No, he likes us.  No.  I don't know why.  Is Bob lighting one cigarette off another?  Can't he come in for 30 seconds?  Should we go outside and do the interview while he smokes?  I mean... 
[03:35:00]  I don't know.  We're supposed to do this once a month?  How long is that going to last?  I hope just once.  Once.  This time.  We'll come back again.  I've got to see Andrew Gore's place.  I like to come back and stuff, but I mean...  Once a month.  Once a week, maybe.  Well, no.  Once a week.  Eventually, we'll just do our show from another studio, and it'll be like we're in New York.  And then every once in a while, we'll throw some XM personalities on the air.  I look kind of like the 60s guy.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, that guy was out of his mind. 
[03:35:30]  He was wild.  I don't know.  I just...  Because now...  Now, you know what mode I'm in right now?  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I'm just in that I know where the train is.  I know where my vehicle is once I get there.  And I just now want to flee.  What time's our train, sweetie?  Two?  Two o'clock, Jimmy.  Two o'clock.  Two o'clock.  Yeah.  Although, if you missed that one, you can take a later one, I heard.  Yeah, but between now and two, it's all about the meeting. 
[03:36:00]  What time's the later train?  Whenever.  I don't know.  Every hour, I guess.  But I don't...  I'm nervous.  I'm out right at two.  But Opie...  At two?  At two, the train pulls out.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  I'm out right at two.  I want to be on the train, and it'll be leaving.  I still have to go to the hotel and check out.  I can't stay at the meetings very long today.  I did that this morning, and it was a huge hassle at 4.45 in the morning for some reason.  Because they have the overnight staff on.  Yeah.  I asked for a zero balance, because I know they're going to wind up charging my credit card. 
[03:36:30]  And they're like, well, we'll just print out blank paper.  Yeah, they're going to charge us for it.  And you were saying about the Do Not Disturb sign thing.  Because that has happened to me at a hotel, too.  I don't get that.  The stupid maids will call when you have the thing on.  And I'm like...  I said to them when she calls me in the afternoon.  I was awake.  But I'm like, do you see the Do Not Disturb sign on my door?  And she's like, yes, but I just thought that you might...  I'm like, do you see the sign?  And she's like, yes.  But sometimes people just forget. 
[03:37:00]  And I'm like, I didn't forget.  Oh, my God, Do Not Disturb means Do Not Disturb.  I've been in hotel rooms where you just want to sleep all day and just not be bothered at all.  And they will get all panicky and worried, and they'll do that.  Yeah.  Oh, brother.  You were the star of the show, so we had to bring you back.  Come on, we could talk.  Okay, I'll try this again.  Oh, you want her to just do more news?  I don't want to do the news.  I'm sick of looking at print.  Yeah.  All morning long. 
[03:37:30]  So, what do you want to do?  I guess I have to do the news, right?  Did Chris Barnes just do it?  What would you do on XM Kids?  What would be some of the lines you would do there?  I, um, well, if it was a Rafi song, I'd talk about Rafi and...  All right, talk about Rafi for a second.  Why, wasn't he fun to listen to, kids?  Oh, my God.  I snored on there, too.  You snored on there, as well?  Yeah.  She has this weird laughing snort thing that happens.  Um, and I just talk about the music, and I do art projects. 
[03:38:00]  Like, um, for New Year's Eve, I did an art project where I made a drum out of an oatmeal container.  You know, those drums.  And what, do you talk kids through it or something?  Uh-huh.  And you say, all right.  It's like preschool time with ZD.  With cricket.  Cricket.  With cricket, right.  You're cricket on the kids' show.  I'm cricket, I know.  Too many people.  So, you're an expert on kids, right?  Um, yeah, I actually have a preschool T-team thinker in it.  All right, so, um, Square Pants.  Wait, Bob.  Square.  Sponge Bob.  Sponge Bob.  Sponge Bob Square Pants.  Is there a gay thing going on there, like they're trying to say? 
[03:38:30]  Uh, you know, they said that about, what's the one called it?  The Teletubbies.  Teletubbies were gay?  Well, no, they said that, too.  You know how they had that whole thing about the Teletubbies and then Barney.  So, they're just going to pick at any kids.  But do you think that Sponge Bab is gay, or is it just they're attacking Sponge Bab because he's more of a...  You're funny.  Um, no, I don't think he's gay.  He's too nice to be gay.  Yeah.  No, no, he could be gay because he's happy.  There you go.  He's happy, he's gay.  You're saying fags aren't nice, pretty much. 
[03:39:00]  That's not a good point, you do.  Is that what cricket is saying?  I didn't say that.  You put words into my mouth.  Why do you hate the fags?  Yeah.  I don't hate fags.  I'm a fag hag.  Why does cricket think fags?  I live with a gay guy.  You're a fag hag?  Yeah.  You have a beard?  She just said, he's too nice to be gay.  You know, I meant, I meant like he's too happy.  That's our other character, Gerbil.  He's the fag hag.  Is that what you say when you're in traffic?  Yeah, traffic is tied up on the 95 because two fags are blowing each other. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, you're mean.  I didn't say that.  Of course you did.  It came out the wrong way.  It did.  It did.  We don't mind the fags.  We like gay people.  Is your name Cricket or are you a cricket on the show?  I'm Cricket.  You're just Cricket.  I'm Cricket.  Like your character isn't a Cricket.  No, I play one on the radio.  That's what it says on one of the sweepers.  Right.  It's Cricket.  She plays one on the radio.  Right.  Okay.  Okay.  And you're a fag hag. 
[03:40:00]  They have good style, you know.  They know how to dress.  So you like to hang out with gay guys?  Yeah, or metrosexual guys.  Yeah.  Wow.  We got to bring her to New York to see what she thinks of Noah.  We're trying to figure out our intern.  We're not really sure what's going on there.  We don't really care.  I have good radar.  Oh, you got the gaydar.  The gaydar?  Gaydar, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Bring in Steve.  Bring in Steve.  Bring in Steve.  All right.  Steve, get on mic.  Get on mic, Steve.  Cricket wants to talk to you. 
[03:40:30]  This is Martini Steve.  He likes to wear the flame wear.  I like that accent.  He likes to dye his hair like Eminem.  And what else?  And gay guys like to say that he has a kind face.  And he's a big bear.  A big bear with a cozy, sweet face.  Right.  Well, one gay guy said it.  They all agreed with it.  Now, what is your gaydar telling you when you look at Steve?  What do you think?  Oh, boy. 
[03:41:00]  This could get uncomfortable.  Well, no, because he's got the Eminem thing, so that's not gay.  That's kind of macho, right?  Yeah.  It is.  In his case, Eminem stands for mule and more mule.  The shirt, though, I mean, it's flaming red.  Yes, it's flaming.  There's a lot of flaming going on there, right?  It's flaming.  I don't know.  No.  No, wait.  Does he have a ring?  Oh, wait.  There's lots of rings. 
[03:41:30]  I was going to say he's got a winery now.  Ah.  I don't know.  Nah.  Metrosexual.  No.  You think metrosexual.  He's gay?  I didn't say no.  You said no, like meaning he's gay.  No, I said no, he's not a metrosexual.  Oh.  Yeah.  He's got his hands hanging out of his pockets by his thumbs.  No metrosexual does that.  I'll try to be as ambiguous as possible.  Steve is.  No, no.  He's not gay.  No.  He's not gay?  Did you see the flame?  No.  Anil there.  No.  Did you see the flame boots?  Flame boots.  All right.  Flame boots? 
[03:42:00]  Oh, my God.  You're mad.  Well, I take that back, maybe.  Yeah.  Now it's a little more gay.  Steve wants you to call him gay.  Yeah.  Please do.  No.  Are you happy?  You're gay.  Everybody's gay.  Right, right.  It just means happy.  Yeah.  Well, according to her, gay people are not nice at all.  I didn't say that.  You're putting words into my mouth.  She really hates the fags.  I love the fags.  I lived with Brian in L.A.  He was a fag.  Who around here is a fag?  Nobody.  I almost had her. 
[03:42:30]  You had roommates that were fags?  Brian in L.A. was gay.  Gay people.  Well, he was bi.  Yeah?  No.  You either are, you're not.  Right.  He was gay.  Is this what cricket teaches on that?  No.  Cricket teaches about arts and crafts and how to be friends and nice to each other and lovey-dovey stuff.  How to be friends, things like that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you talk about Heather's, like, Heather's roommate or Heather's mommy?  Heather has two mommies?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you ever get into that?  No.  No?  No?  You just talk about fun songs? 
[03:43:00]  No.  No.  Yeah, we play Melissa Etheridge, though.  You do?  And the Indigo Girls.  Wow.  That's some big broads.  And what do you say, like, those are some dykes.  No?  No, I don't say they're dykes.  These are dykes.  No, I just say, hey, wasn't there a cool song by Melissa?  That's how you do it?  Yeah.  Do you take calls from little kids?  No.  No?  Why not?  Well, because I'm on during the day.  And at night, I'll be on late in the future.  Then I'll take calls.  Then you'll take calls from little kids? 
[03:43:30]  So basically, you do a kid's radio show when the kids are at school.  Well, they're in their car on their way to school.  In their car driving?  With their moms and dads.  Right.  And the moms and dads are listening to...  Cricket.  To cricket.  12 to 4 Eastern Standard Time.  Channel 160.  Have you ever played George Michael and referred to him as that Peter Pumper?  Is that Peter Pumper?  No.  No.  Oh, that voice is killer, man.  That's a great voice. 
[03:44:00]  That's great.  Wait, who's doing that?  What do you have, like five?  No, see, I was just talking and the snort happened.  What do you have, like five songs to choose from on the day?  No, there's actually a lot.  You should check it out today.  I really should.  Yeah, there's a lot of songs.  Like, Paul McCartney has one about...  Oh, cool.  Handicapped people?  No.  No, no, no, no.  Paul McCartney has a new CD out for kids and...  Oh, my God.  They Might Be Giants.  Awesome CDs for kids.  Really?  Yes.  I was shocked. 
[03:44:30]  Yes.  It's all nice.  How do you know one of the CDs is awesome for kids?  Because it's cool music.  I'm really into it.  Is it made for kids?  Yeah, it's for...  Like, the show that I do is more like preschool age.  Yeah.  And then after that, Mindy comes on and she does more of the older kids.  The tweens?  Yeah, the pre-tweens.  Yeah.  How cute.  And, um...  She thinks you're cute, Anthony.  Now I'll tell her I know that because I date them. 
[03:45:00]  No, seriously, though.  It's a fun channel.  Oh, he's being serious.  And Kenny...  Kenny does the...  Kenny's show is funny.  He's on right now.  Oh, there's some little music.  That's a little music we play.  Do you like the Wiggles?  I love the Wiggles, but they...  Yeah.  They're fun.  Yeah?  But they what?  They're happy.  They're very happy.  But they're all...  She just...  But she said, but they're all...  She just made, like, the hand-to-the-mouth thing and went...  I did not!  I love the Wiggles.  They're from Australia. 
[03:45:30]  Any...  Right.  Okay, I've seen the Wiggles.  They are from Australia, but I mean...  Australia.  Yeah, but that...  I love that stuff.  Wait, where are the Wiggles from?  Australia.  Okay.  Australia.  All right.  You are a pip.  Pretty good.  All right.  When can we hear you now?  You're going to be on...  12 to 4.  12 to 4.  Channel 116.  Cricket.  I'm shortwave.  Cricket.  I'm going to have to listen and hear you talk a little bit.  It's too bad you don't take listener calls.  How come... 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  The Wiggles are popular with kids, but I mean, being from England, I think that's the problem.  Is it...  Right?  They're not from England.  Where are they from?  Where?  Where?  Sydney.  Sydney.  Something.  Sydney.  No, because you want me to say it, so I won't say it.  Say what?  Yeah.  What do you want to say?  Down Under.  Down Under.  Yeah.  They're from Down Under.  Oh.  He's snorting again. 
[03:46:30]  All right.  This train wreck of a program is just about over.  Dee Dee, thank you so much.  You're welcome.  When I come to New York, I'll have to come and say hi.  You absolutely will.  Yes.  We'll have you on the phone, though, because you're a new character for the program.  Okay.  Cricket.  She'll be our kid issue expert.  Oh, yeah, because we need experts.  We need experts for many, many subjects for the show.  Oh, there's this one song.  Oh, my God.  Funky is a diaper.  That, you have to check out.  That song cracks me up every time I play it.  Do we get it on the show tomorrow?  Is it about a big jump in a diaper?  Oh, absolutely. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, and poop goes the weasel we play.  It goes, it starts off, poof goes the weasel like he's farting.  It was hilarious.  These songs are funny.  What channel are you on?  116.  All right.  That's it.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here. </pre>
