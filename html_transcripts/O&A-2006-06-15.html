<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts and Bill Burr (filling in for James Norton) engaging in vulgar self-deprecating introductions.  After this crude opening, they discussed an article about the show in *Friday Morning Quarterback*, comparing its price to other publications, and segued into a discussion about their guilty pleasure of reading celebrity gossip magazines.  Travis then presented a list of violent news headlines (stabbing, anti-white speech, house explosion, rape, wrongful death lawsuit, ski instructor raping a student, murder by a naked lunatic, fatal car accident), sparking a lengthy, rambling segment about a fictional "Naked Superhero" with lightning-fast kung fu, whose weakness was cold water (causing shrinkage), and whose sidekick was "Naked Midget Man." A listener called in with a related childhood anecdote.  The segment continued with further creative additions to the Naked Superhero's backstory, catchphrases, and kryptonite, before transitioning to promoting their upcoming comedy tour.

A prank on staff member Danny, who came to work unusually neatly dressed, was revealed, resulting in comedic outrage.  This led to banter about workplace dynamics and more listener calls. The show then shifted to discussing the difficulties of watching sports like golf and football live, due to weather and crowds, as well as poorly designed sports uniforms and Bush's visit to Baghdad.

The show then moved on to a discussion of Britney Spears’ appearance and perceived instability, which morphed into a humorous segment on the fashion choices of various sports teams, focusing on the ugly uniforms of the 80s Astros and Buccaneers, and short NBA shorts.  Adam Ferrara was mentioned in the green room, and Stephen Lynch was announced as the next day's guest; a Lynch song about Dungeons & Dragons was played.  Adam Ferrara joined the conversation, sharing stories about his and Opie's impoverished youths, irresponsible spending habits, and odd jobs, recounting humorous anecdotes involving dart guns and credit card debt.  The absurdity of President Bush reprimanding a legally blind reporter for wearing sunglasses was discussed, followed by shared embarrassing moments.  Damien Fahey from MTV's TRL joined them in studio. The segment concluded with more discussion of Britney Spears, including her driving with her baby on her lap, and a Dateline interview clip, as well as a lengthy discussion of the “Cancer Kazoo” guy's anti-smoking PSAs.


A further segment began with more discussion of Britney Spears and motherhood, teasing a pre-recorded "crying clip" for the next show.  Adam Ferrara and Damien Fahey (still in studio) were present. The hosts engaged in their "perp walk" segment, which was unusually uneventful due to the weather. Fahey discussed the anxiety surrounding the release of a movie featuring his name. The “dump report” highlighted offensive segments cut from the FM broadcast, including sexually explicit jokes and conversations involving Bill Burr, Adam Ferrara, and the hosts.  Bill Burr discussed his experience on *Last Comic Standing*, criticizing its format and offering to produce a future season. A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a *Supergroup* clip of Sebastian Bach struggling to name a band, culminating in the name "Damnocracy."  Al Jorgensen (Ministry) contributed a graphic anecdote about an ostrich encounter at a European zoo. Sunset Thomas and Rebecca Love also joined as guests.

The final segment focused on Al Jorgensen’s graphic, exaggerated anecdote about a band member’s alleged interspecies rape of an ostrich at a zoo while on drugs.  Sunset Thomas (porn star) and Rebecca Love joined the discussion, leading to a stream of increasingly absurd and sexually explicit jokes, tangents about band names (including "Ku Klux Clowns"), rumors about Paul McCartney's wife, offensive chick punk band names, and the band's tour experiences, including their dogs contracting an STI.  Sex toys were brought out and discussed, and the porn star guest discussed her career and awards nominations.  The conversation consistently included references to bestiality, sexual acts, bodily functions, and jokes about celebrities and social groups. The show concluded with playful banter about the segment and plans for future broadcasts.

[00:08:00]  swinging a rubber chicken right i'm insane naked hack right he's got groucho mark mild-mannered naked guy  attacks uh cab driver helps four yeah you never see that either right naked guy helps four i was  hanging from a cliff i didn't feel like i could hang on any longer then all of a sudden this naked  guy just came over the horizon very mild-mannered thank god i want to say thank you naked guy 
[00:08:30]  at his wits about him it never happens that you never see that story he's either stabbing people  or getting tasered by the police yeah and you're always running if you're naked in public yeah it's  a sense of urgency yes you must get yourself out of that situation that you put yourself in what if  there were you could be naked in public but you can't be stationary no you just have to keep moving  running which i think is why people call you a lunatic that's like trying to get all the lights as 
[00:09:00]  you're going up manhattan you know you got to stay within the green you can't stop as people  is that guy naked you gotta keep that that's like it turning yellow every every day up uh third avenue  yeah i come up third uh and i make the turn out of the tunnel now i'm on third and my light turns  green now i know and go i know that 23 miles an hour i could shut my eyes and i will make every light  eight they're red then i see the turns yellow it's green whoosh i'm through it 23 miles an hour 
[00:09:30]  is the exact speed by the way it doesn't turn yellow before it turns green uh no i see the yellow on the  other side like the side that's uh you said oh yeah like a little drag race like it's green i can see  it's green coming the other way and then it turns yellow and i know that it's going to be red my side's  going to turn green i'm going to be mr picky guy today i'm going to focus on what's going on on  every little detail at least you were able to explain yourself because i really thought i had 
[00:10:00]  you no i'm looking at the size last time you saw a lyco red yellow green but now you made it now it  makes sense how you explain it makes perfect sense but uh there are people that want to race up to the  red light screech on the brakes wait till it turns green race up to the next red light wait wasting uh time  because now if they cut in front of me they're screwing me up they're screwing my timeline up now  i got to get back around them why can't they understand pace with me comes the rage i understand 
[00:10:30]  the timing i do it on a daily basis there's no reason to tear up to a red light so you can jam on  the brakes and then take your foot off and pound on the gas because i'm behind you now now you've  screwed up my day i can make it down third three minutes you know how long that takes at about noon  and i'm not kidding about 45 minutes 45 minutes to get from uh the uh tunnel uh up to 57th 
[00:11:00]  that's a drag it certainly is well we got off naked guy yeah oh naked guy and what if there was a  superhero but his whole thing was he was naked did you have to arrest them couldn't be a superhero  do you have to arrest them or do you let him do his thing because he's he's doing good is he  helping he's helping all the time but the problem is he insists on being naked the whole time is he  helping like stupid helping no he's like he's like he's like really spider-man superman but he's 
[00:11:30]  naked guy criminals and that's his thing yeah that's a good question but he's a superhero and  something happened back in his childhood and he has to be naked has to be naked while he's doing this  while he's uh saving the city but while he's his alter ego is it our is it our responsibility to  arrest uh naked uh superhero is he is he clothed while he's normal in life until he sees some  problem yeah oh yeah and he rips his clothes off that's what makes it so bizarre because he's just  walking the streets like any other guy and then he sees like i don't know an old lady in distress  and he has to he can't do anything until he's completely naked when he flies is is he in the 
[00:12:00]  superman position or laying on his back he does fly though i don't know because spider-man you can  almost say he flies because of the way no he can't fly because then he's ripping off hoo-hoo uh superman  yeah but there's gotta be some kind of power you can't just be naked guy and help people without  some type of power you can't fly without a cape that's all i'm saying and that's true he'd have  to wear a cape yeah no he's naked guy he is naked guy powers what's his powers he needs powers you 
[00:12:30]  can't take your clothes off and help people first of all you're gonna be laughed at unless you're  you're kicking ass with some super power yeah and then you can't help it say there's five muggers  and they're going after somebody you're naked guy you rip your clothes off now you're naked you jump in  you're getting your ass kicked lightning speed kung fu moves even underdog wow that's his power  okay that's good uh saying even underdog had a uniform that's a dog and they're technically naked 
[00:13:00]  all the time all the time right but he's not naked he's got the cape this superhero is technically  do because you have fur it's like pants yeah he's naked by the way steven for basior naked guy  the superhero from man town man we haven't forgotten about man town look up in the sky  it's a penis it's testicles it's naked naked guy save me naked guy naked guy protecting man town 
[00:13:30]  but do you arrest him um you let crime go up because you can't have naked guy running around  the city he's setting a bad precedent and i don't think the mayor would be for him he'd be one of  those like very dark heroes where the law enforcement doesn't like it almost like a vigilante  yeah because he's naked if he wore clothes he'd be praised as a hero this is something this is the  thing you know every superhero has that that dark part of them that part that they have to like 
[00:14:00]  hate and that's uh that gives them that alter ego part you know where their superhero if you're a  superhero and you're saving everybody and you went home every day and went i'm the greatest guy in  the world this is the greatest life i love this but every one of them is tortured naked guy his  parents got murdered at woodstock gotta be naked when they were dancing naked in the mud pit  oh what's his kryptonite it's like gonorrhea or something it's like an std i think anything 
[00:14:30]  could be his kryptonite rolling up have him roll up an extension cord and have that end hit him  right in the exact this gonna have that happen lex luther keeps sending hookers over to his  apartment his kryptonite is his small junk and if he doesn't move fast enough people point and laugh  well and then he's he he doesn't have any more how about that kryptonite okay you brought up a good  point bill uh naked women you send things that get him into a certain state and when he's in that 
[00:15:00]  state he can't go outside because even as a superhero he's just too embarrassed to go out like  that you can't go out like that you can't fight crime it's just while you're you know a tan it's  just a great concept by the way it's just well i think i think snl should run with this if they want  me to if they want me to write the entire bit just give me a call oh come on i could see it now  i mean he's doing great things for the city but he has to do it naked and does he get arrested after 
[00:15:30]  everything he does no matter how good no they're confused they don't know what to do because he's  getting things done you know the cops kind of talk to him and go all right look he's helping people  get out of here but look he's breaking the law yeah he's exposed there's a subway train and it went  on the wrong track and it's heading for a wall uh-oh the only person that could save it is naked  guy so you can't arrest a guy he's doing good rips his clothes off somehow bends the track  gets him on the right track and then everyone goes thank you naked guy right and the cops are like  naked guy can we talk to you over here no but that's that's perfect because there's always like 
[00:16:00]  gotta be something about the superhero that the public can't quite embrace so he's naked you know  they'd be huddling thanks for saving my kid but you're an adult and you're nude and you're naked  you need to get away from me right yeah just go thank you but and then the the wacky banter with  the people on the platform like what are you doing because all of a sudden he's getting naked my god  he's naked and you think he might be uh the the naked lunatic but it's it's the naked guy superhero  that that takes care of you have to announce i'm naked guy and then they're like oh okay oh i heard 
[00:16:30]  about naked guy yeah he doesn't get a lot of personal thank you gotta have a tattoo on his middle of his  chest for his emblem a big n flesh-colored n and then he has to awkwardly put his clothes back on  after he does his good deed oh just like awkwardly bending over putting his underwear on as people  looking just trying to find his underpants where did i leave him like yo he has to find out where  he like because he just got to rip his clothes off because now the adrenaline's gone and now it's the 
[00:17:00]  awkward like you know the deed's done and everyone's looking at the guy that did the deed he doesn't  hold up his clothes and place him somewhere he's busy so then do people go naked  i think i saw like some yeah there's a sock over there over and he's got to awkwardly pick up his  clothes each time he bends over to get something people kind of go oh the biggest god naked guy  the biggest fear of the criminals is the sound of feet slapping against the pavement bare feet  the pitter patter by the way uh on one of the fan sites yesterday they're discussing if this show is 
[00:17:30]  scripted this is a perfect example oh stop it proves that we're not scripted we weren't going to talk  about naked guy the superhero it just came out of my head naked guy after reading this dumb headline  because you only get naked well if you got naked lunatic naked lunatic you need naked uh superhero  alter ego to fight naked lunatic yeah naked lunatic yes is the villain the villain is your basic naked  lunatic how do you tell the two he's he's very unshaven naked lunatic naked lunatic is very unshaven 
[00:18:00]  yeah naked uh uh superhero is um naked man he's very well kemped he's uh he's a metrosexual  is he is it a metrosexual what is it what is it called metrosexual metrosexual sexual and  jesus danny we'll get into your  this is this is so great hold on we're in the middle of a bit yeah we're in the middle of i know  danny's probably very pissed off by now we'll get into no i don't think your whole thing in a second  gotta tear tickets at lows because we just gotta fill it we gotta finish up with uh naked lunatic 
[00:18:30]  the villain it's a naked well danny has to get out of here if we're gonna finish it get out of here  yeah you're the worst danny you have the worst timing you wait you bet it's like get over there  immediately we're in the middle of a riff here like we're we're developing a bit live on the air  he comes in he's dressed like billy mills oh dude these guys billy mills fucking guys screaming 
[00:19:00]  everywhere oh the what guy all right there's number one on the sheet today i can't number two i think  two maybe three yeah maybe three no but you you stayed away from the uh oh my i worked that like  uh an artist i painted a picture absolutely that will not end up on a dump sheet attention that was  a good one gary on long island gary no it would be pretty strange to see naked guy coming over to  stop naked villain from uh naked lunatic the villain yeah no i think is i think naked guy's uh 
[00:19:30]  kryptonite is uh cold water oh cold water oh if they throw cold water on him then he's again  embarrassed yeah because he has a nice presentation by shrinkage but all you have to do is throw some  ice water or cold water on him yeah you get that shrinkage factor yes he goes like oh my god  turns away and runs from the scene people still don't get it timmy and philly naked guy have a  mask no he's naked nothing you can't hide behind a mask it's so easy to walk around manhattan if you

[00:26:00]  with a technicolor to pick up before we move on a couple more phone calls uh let's wrap up uh  the naked man superhero thing yes let's say hi to jay in queens jay uh yeah why don't we give him a  sidekick like naked midget man hmm yeah he needs a sidekick a little a little goofy though and his  sidekick needs to be a little uh little unit he needs to be a bit of a faggotino you should even  give him a bigger unit now it's like the ambiguously gay duo yeah i think uh his uh sidekick should be a 
[00:26:30]  little uh a little faggy much shorter with with large junk that's good because it creates tension  that's what i'm thinking that's what i'm thinking you need that tension between like naked guy is in  charge but he's not as uh well in doubt happy with what he has with the goods as his sidekick he  almost gets away with it but of course the ice water the cold water really they never throw it on

[00:31:00]  begin with this okay uh first with a description of danny today as opposed to danny on any other  given day danny on any given day would be dressed like yeah that's a good like a dirt bag like a  dirt bag yeah which uh let me tell you there is no problem with that your hair usually you know just  woke up kind of do uh t-shirt with some type of logo on it some type of of the dead shirt that yeah that  shows that you got it for free somewhere slayer t-shirt yeah something like that pants i don't 
[00:31:30]  notice what type of pants he wears on a daily basis that is it just jeans that haven't been washed in  weeks a while and rotting sneakers footwear just sneakers rotting rotting sneakers wallet with that  big chain is it yeah wallet with a chain right and then uh unshaven just about every day  yeah just about every day how is he dressed today anthony uh wow khaki i see you have some khakis on 
[00:32:00]  dress pants there is a brown they're they're kind of grayish brown i guess your khakis there's a brown  shirt that you're wearing and it's one of the it's a golf shirt it's collared it's a collared  golf shirt home depot right bingo that is the exact look of a home depot manager bj's whole yeah  whatever the hell it is warehouse and he's got his uh a belt on he's wearing a belt and on that belt 
[00:32:30]  is clipped his cell phone on one side and his id his company id on the other so he could get into the  various doorways very clean shaven very clean shaven his hair washed and slicked back yeah he's got  some kind of hair product in that is keeping his hair back and in place and he has his sunglasses  very fashionably tucked in the um very 80s v-neck of his uh collared shirt collared shirt what kind 
[00:33:00]  of shoes you got on well i didn't i didn't have any shoes so i'm just wearing my my old boots yeah but  they're they're black and and you you must have wiped them off i contemplated it but i said ah  screw it because there's really no dirt on them yeah they look fine the books yeah this is his  alter ego bob bob bob this is a naked man's alter ego very good bob and uh your watch you usually wear  that yes i do okay it's very nice very fashionable by the way is your dad naked man the superhero yes 
[00:33:30]  actually he could quite possibly we learned a lot about danny in the last few months and uh we found out  that his father likes to be naked all the time yeah he just kind of hangs out naked all the time  anyway why are you dressed like this yeah i know but i only found out around 5 15 this morning this  is a bit of brilliance on the part of uh other people um yeah why are you dressed like this oh because 
[00:34:00]  i i was told that we actually are are going to be having a dress code implemented around here  listen to ben ben's in charge look i love when ben laughs uncontrollably because then i sit there and  go but ben you're the one in charge and all hell's breaking loose around you now danny who who told you  there was going to be a dress code everyone everyone being uh let's see ben ben steve steve uh  fanimal van uh and uh and the newly shaven travis travis yeah well derrick well because derrick's the 
[00:34:30]  one that blew the whole gag in the first place i that's what gave me an inkling that this was a  whole thing did you go uh-oh what happened because dumb travis goes i i can't really travis is just  like he dresses every day i can't really opposed to you i can't really he's like i can't really  talk about it called derrick but they failed to fill derrick in yet so when i called derrick he goes  what are you talking about and then all of a sudden i just hear silence and then oh that oh yeah 
[00:35:00]  oh yeah dude everyone's pissed but it's already too late and obviously you weren't completely sure  because you're dressed really nice today well you know when you hear from eight different people  it's like i don't know well i guess i'll see what's going on tomorrow these guys bust balls  behind the scenes constantly there's pranks and hijinks going on all the time it's a daily gang  rape that you consistently show up to anthony and i leave like minutes after the show's over every day  and that's when the fun really begins with these guys behind the scenes the plotting and the planning 
[00:35:30]  they're just trying to get each other all the time yes then now did you smell bit before or after  you went pants shopping oh yeah because we found out that he doesn't own this he doesn't own he had  to go out and get nice clothes yeah you know he bought slacks went to the store bought some slacks  slacks he bought slacks and this shirt and the shirt i don't own this crap either what'd that set  you back uh well luckily i'm frugal i shop at tj maxx so ah okay i was gonna guess the uh sears roebuck 
[00:36:00]  how much like 50 bucks 50 bucks yeah you don't you're probably not in a position where you could  just throw away 50 bucks no not really that's my kind of bill no not really by the way rob uh from  his mobile device it's radio a-hole why would it matter what you're wearing thinking the whole time  i'm like dude this doesn't make any sense i knew it was bit then i show up this morning and i'm like  and steve's wearing his you know his regular workout attire and i'm just like showing those guns 
[00:36:30]  let me guess this doesn't apply to you guys right oh no no no i gotta be honest steve is the only one  that thinks about what he's gonna wear before he gets in here yeah but actually not in a business  like way no in a way to show off his arms and tattoos right and how big he's getting he's all  about showing off his arms yeah boy he's all about dressing like freddie mercury i have not seen  that much chest hair in my life freddie mercury yeah he's got a shave like up to his neck like he's  got a neckline shave where the chest hair i think he has a barber's chair and some old man comes in 
[00:37:00]  with that leather strap and that straight straight razor yeah so uh well airs him up down to his navel  well this all started with an email we're gonna like have a meeting soon just to see how everything's  going yeah you know to see how it's going back on commercial radio and all that and that's when  ben and the gang decided this would be a good uh time to kind of screw down like a meeting with  the bosses to go over any of our needs then you asked what the meeting's about and and and uh they 
[00:37:30]  said something like tom is is uh not happy about how people are dressing around here yeah it was like  part of it something like because tom is always so well dressed tom is like dressed to the nines  every day suit tie like fitted suits guys got like gazillion dollars worth of suits and and you're  kind of intimidated uh walking up to him dressed like a slob probably i would think i would think  if you're then told that there's going to be a meeting involving tom about a dress code that you're 
[00:38:00]  then thinking oh my god this guy wears like suits that cost thousands i gotta go to tj maxx and pick  up some slags yeah i mean plus you know i guess they did a good job of filling everybody in on it so  you know no matter who i called they all know yeah but here is the major flaw in their pro i mean  obviously i guess the major flaw as you're sitting there in brand new clothes that you went out and  bought yesterday afternoon the victim yeah that's a major flaw all right major flaw more importantly he's 
[00:38:30]  going to a pta meeting major flaws you fell for the entire thing i say it's a minor flaw yeah what is  the little tiny flaw the thing that made me think something was awry so to speak was that no one could  give me a story like it was all very very you didn't have enough confidence that's perfect for  this crew because no one ever has the story in this crew it's always vague yes somebody look at him  trying to downplay that you're in brand new clothes you didn't have enough confidence to come in dress 
[00:39:00]  like you usually dress you you thought in the back of your head that uh this could be uh real so i  better dress appropriately plus it's a lot harder to get eight people on the exact same lie so just keep  it vague right there see you go and then and then the stories don't get tripped up oh a little roll  of the ice from danny i saw that upset he's not happy he's very pissed let me tell you there's going  to be hell to pay because this all goes back and forth so now danny's going to come up with some  retaliation he's plotting you can see it like it's uh 
[00:39:30]  it's all right by the way uh once in a while you somebody just makes an ass out of you i mean it  just happens uh bird from philly again he's a regular uh dressed to the nines is that a 1940s  reference what the f does that mean dress to the nines 23 skidoo he's dressed to the nines and smoking  lucky strike cigarettes in his brand new slacks always have a pack of luckies or chesterfields in 
[00:40:00]  the pants pocket of my slacks anthony had his first drink at a speakeasy yeah i had to have the right  knock all right thing opened up there's payback going to be a bitch there danny well probably not  since you know the little sewing circle will never get on my stomach oh you left out  he's like a he's like naked man he's just alienated from public is there a click well 
[00:40:30]  then comment little sewing circle is there like click going on like it's forming i think of you guys  all as the same pieces of crap like i there's no hierarchy when i look at you you're all  equally worthless to me well thank you anthony no problem uh not not as far as work goes i mean  of course you guys do your job you do it very well as far as just your worth in life and how it affects 
[00:41:00]  me and my life again not through work just just in life you're equally travis you are the same piece  of garbage as than as danny i it just doesn't matter to me well there's clicks but they're always  shifting like for instance two days ago we locked travis out of the office and it posted false  comments from his myspace account was he looking in watching it happen in horror i wasn't happy 
[00:41:30]  and about after about 25 seconds he goes oh he gets the okay bits over stop messing with me look  and that's when it gets even more fun that's when it's supposed to get more fun that's when the joke  begins there's something every day i mean there was one day who was it that that uh sent out the  myspace bulletin that such and such was getting married to poe that was me yeah that was travis  and it was me that was getting married to poe that was a good one hey by the way tim in california  has a good observation tim what's up hey what are you guys doing insulting about half of your audience 
[00:42:00]  by saying we all look like dirtbags yeah our audience dresses like danny's dress today of course of  course i just don't have a chain drive wallet that's about it it's it's uh called dressing  comfortably very comfortable all right just just take the joke tim come on and what they do also  is uh they'll they'll leave each other's emails open they'll forget like walk away from the computer  and then i could be guaranteed to get an email that night from one of the crew who of course uh found 
[00:42:30]  somebody else's email open and it's usually something like uh hey anthony it's travis here  um at the the appearance went real well the other day i was thinking you know maybe me and you could  hang out go out to dinner i think we have a lot in common you're so funny and just and it's one of  these idiots on his email just typing so i'll type back something you know hey that sounds like a great idea  you know uh let's make a date of it uh see when your calendar's free and if i'm not shooting myself 
[00:43:00]  in the face that day i might be able to make it something like that so one day they left uh danny's  open and typed something i can't even remember what it was but i was so pissed that day i just wrote  f off on the thing and used the entire word and uh for like a day and a half two days danny actually  thought i was mad at him because i didn't add some witty little thing well because usually it was  just get more f off than just that so i'm thinking oh man he's maybe maybe this is finally 
[00:43:30]  the day i thought i'd change it up a little bit let's go to cody in indiana cody hey guys  billy builder yes you need to slap them all in the face your speaking line was fantastic and you got  nothing for it it wasn't a joke it was the truth that's why it didn't get a laugh see that's  haven't you guys not know what a speakeasy is of course we do well why not the last billy bird  because we're too busy trying to come up with something uh funny ourselves that's why you guys 
[00:44:00]  are there to make sure the guys get the big laughs that they deserve with you guys good luck bro all  right no we like when the listeners uh you know uh uh whatever uh uh listen dan what's up  nothing dan oh that me yeah go ahead hey yeah i love uh quick impression of danny as he sits there  in his newly bought store clothes well i saw flaws in the system yeah i'm hearing new clothes but more  importantly more importantly i'm dressed nicely oh call back yes all right more importantly i didn't 
[00:44:30]  buy a three-piece suit exactly all right we're gonna break and uh catch up a little bit so why uh oh danny  all right yeah i'm just waiting for tomorrow maybe i'll switch my coffee with decaf or something  why wasn't i informed that uh red rum on pal talk here was taking a shower until she's wrapping a  towel around her head you know you people you people on pal talk are being very greedy very selfish  watching pal talk here of course they can watch us in the studio they've they've been looking at 
[00:45:00]  danny's attire yeah we got the pal talk camera the pal talk cameras are set up and we can actually  watch the listeners wonderful and uh red rum takes a shower every morning and it's uh right there on  the pal talk camera she moved her shower time down by the way yeah i know shower later in the morning  later in the morning but now she's showering but i catch the end of the shower what the hell's that  all about it's a little mystery in the relationship now because of that someone's got to pay i'm just  going to pick a random person yeah this is like the old days um you boink i'm banning you from the 
[00:45:30]  room oh there you go bye you see nothing the rest of the day bye bye you know why why because i just  picked that person because i was angry just because someone didn't tell you that red rum was uh showering  i pick yeah so if someone had to pay and it was him i just pick random people sometimes i pardon you  not not today he rules with an iron fist iron fist with his band button all right we gotta take a 
[00:46:00]  break he must be like mussolini no he likes the other guy better a lot hacky at this point but it's  how about yeah i mean give me something you want something uh a little more current i mean just a  little you know you'll get nothing all right listen someone else is showering all right we'll check  that out as we take a break it's the ona virus spreading across america new york 12 million  people 50 million radios one radio show full of douchebags opium anthony opium anthony show 
[00:46:30]  hey thanks for checking us out this morning it's the opium anthony show bill burr sitting in for  jim norton norton's gonna be on leno tonight uh we're here and they're doing like u.s open uh highlights  so leno's gonna start a little later than usual so keep that in mind but check out little jimmy  norton on jay leno tonight i'm going to the u.s open today by the way oh you are i'm leaving early 
[00:47:00]  golf without the l i'm leaving early today because i got to get up to wing foot where is wing foot it's  like uh north a little bit what is it called wing foot or is it winged foot i don't know i've never  been to a professional well i've never even watched regular people play golf golf doesn't seem like  a spectator sport it's much better on tv you know and it kind of blows on tv to tell you the truth  i love watching golf on sundays it's very relaxing you sit back and just kind of have it in the 
[00:47:30]  background you know what kills me though is when they go to tee off all those people standing right  on the side it's like don't they ever actually some one day tank one and just like slice it right  and send it right into their face yeah because you'll do anything as a spectator to get a nice  uh you know uh view of what's what's going on so yeah you'll gamble with your life to to see a shot  they're about yeah 20 30 feet in front of the tee uh on either side just kind of watching i know you 
[00:48:00]  know i play golf pretty badly and i know that that if anybody was standing there they're in in definite  danger that's a good that's a good uh challenge on like fear factor have people stand where you  would stand if the person was a professional tiger woods and then have a hat golfer just go  have a hat golfer go there that just sends it flying into their face but anthony when they're on  the tee with the big mallets that they now you know that are called drivers yeah the odds of them 
[00:48:30]  going off and hitting a spectator very ridiculously rare them but what them not like regular golfers  no i know but what's uh more interesting is when they're like in the rough in between trees and  stuff and they still line up like that all right that's when it gets a little crazy like you're nuts  just to see tiger woods hit one ball you know i'm going up there i've been to a couple uh you know uh  u.s opens and things like that um and the funny thing is you'll see people they'll have their their 
[00:49:00]  their uh their program and the and you'll hear them all the time like what do you want to do uh  uh let's go for let's go follow tiger woods around you can't follow tiger woods around at  these golf tournaments you can't know what you do you go about six or seven holes ahead of everybody  else and you wait for tiger woods to show up on that hole yeah and you watch him hit one golf ball 
[00:49:30]  because by the time uh he gets there it's packed it's completely packed i'm not even kidding it's it's  like 20 people deep it's ridiculous and you can't see him you've got to pretty much climb a tree to  see tiger woods hit a golf ball and that's what you do but you get these people with their programs  let's follow tiger around for a while you don't you just don't follow tiger around maybe i can caddy for  sure you don't follow him around yeah delusional jack it's not a great spectator sport you're right  that's like auto racing i went to uh i went to the indy 500 because it was just yeah now that sounds 
[00:50:00]  like something that would be exciting what greatest spectacle in sport yeah you just sit  you just sit there and they just go flying by and you think well maybe somebody  that's all you see right and you would think okay maybe if i see somebody hit the wall it's going to  be cool but you don't realize they hit the wall after they hit the wall they're still going about  a buck eighty so you just hit the wall they go what you want to do is they hit the wall  like a half a mile before you before you and then watch the debris go but you to be like in the 
[00:50:30]  middle of it you wanted to stop right in front of you yeah and then you love tangled tattered you  want to be sitting up high too is what i learned i had like i was like on the inside of a turn  it was off the worst place yeah the whole thing was it was with a bunch of you can't even read the  numbers on the cars right you have no idea what's going on until they're on the uh far side of the  track the track is so huge that that you only see them when they are in front of you oh yeah  like you're not going to see them on the other side of the track yeah we had like a big gambling 
[00:51:00]  pool that's like the best part of everybody picks like five cars and your guys in the lead they go  by and then the next time it comes around you it's like your guy isn't there anymore you're like what  happened he had a pit tires yeah you got to ask that guy with the am radio on his head yeah antenna i'm  here and uh he he pitted yeah and uh yeah you're screwed yeah there's a lot of sports it's not worth  going to no spectator now that i think about it's not worth going to the u.s open it's not worth the 
[00:51:30]  hassle getting up there i went for one of the practice rounds and it was a major hassle and there  was no one there because it was just practice rounds so it's gonna just be a zoo you know what  i can if anyone has parking really close to winged foot or give me a call right now man vip treatment for  you if i could park in on your lawn you know what game sucks as a spectator sport because of the uh  time of year is football now i understand football is great to to watch but it is too goddamn cold 
[00:52:00]  i got dragged once to a game and this is going back quite a ways and i think this is the last  football game i ever went to my father dragged me face masks it was yeah no they wore leather helmets  i saw the galloping ghost first red grange i saw the gift play no it was uh almost though believe it  or not it was uh a jets game when they were playing at shea so oh my god anthony i was a little kid 
[00:52:30]  i was a little kid and i almost got uh lost actually i almost got crushed in the men's room  i had to go and my father brings me in you know he's holding my hand i had to go i had to go ah stop  and i walk in there and and the place was packed and i'm getting like like crushed by just all these  guys and you had to go in the trough at the time they had a big trough there and i i wouldn't go 
[00:53:00]  you know mate again i was the shower all over again no that was a big cry baby my father was like  ah son of a bitch you know what you don't know cold no it was effing cold man football  you don't know cold you don't know cold the way we go when i was doing radio in buffalo all right  i remember like i do this i hate i remember like it was yesterday like the radio station i worked for  they they had really nice tickets for the bills games okay and it was when the bills were in the 
[00:53:30]  super bowl like four years in a row so it was the time to see the bills remember those victorious  years for buffalo and all the all the big wigs at the radio station uh the first couple games of  the season when it's still 80 out yeah you can wear shorts and a and a and you know a short sleeve  shirt or whatever it was 50 yard line 10 rows up perfect seats right and then the cold weather  comes in and they don't want to go there anymore nope so they give it to you know they give it to me 
[00:54:00]  the lackeys of the station that will just take anything for free uh it was the saints bills  single digits wind chill factor that brought it way down like minus 20 degrees the stadium was uh it  snowed um and it was so cold up there for a week leading up to the game they couldn't fall out the  stadium meaning they couldn't get rid of all the ice so you had to sit on blocks of ice i'm not  kidding i'm wonderful i remember this like it was yesterday what a great day single digits uh  wind chill sitting on a block of ice that was at least four inches of ice and your feet exaggerated 
[00:54:30]  i swear to god i swear to god and and your feet you were placed on four feet of uh four four inches  of ice as well did they have a fan blowing on you  everybody from either buffalo or chicago my parents are from out that way oh chicago no matter how cold  except a paper room my nostrils would be sticking together that kind of cold coming home complaining  my heart but debbie you don't you don't know cold no let me tell you you're walking down michigan  avenue in chicago let me tell you we watched a few bears games and i thought i was gonna drop dead 
[00:55:00]  right there freezing to death somehow minus five back here isn't as cold as minus five anywhere else  right yeah billy lost five of his fingers in the first quarter alone we were and then uh for the  rest of the game because he didn't want to leave because it's the bears he lost his toes and his nose  because it's chicago chicago we know it's cold and windy there we were all dressed like the little  kid from a christmas story though just like so many layers on you couldn't move doesn't matter it 
[00:55:30]  still doesn't help there was something about it though it's fun and there's no move here it is too  there's no moving around and and it wasn't the last game i went to because now i'm remembering uh  when we were in boston i went to uh harvard stadium to watch the boston patriots and nick bonacani  on the statue of liberty play i went to bobby lane was having an off day

[00:59:00]  those are the matt cavanaugh years the stupid guy on the side of the helmet  you know it's funny that's like one of the only throwback uniforms i hate i look at that little  man on that helmet and it just reminds me of just such failure the like the guy from the sam adams  beer bottle in the position of like the saint paulie's girl was on the side of our helmet  and he's in like a football stance you know on the line he's a patriot oh yeah get it the patriots  he's white so right you know we're losing here's a question for you today here's a question for you 
[00:59:30]  today bill a worst sports uniform hmm i don't think it's the patriots vancouver canucks why their old  school one i don't remember what was it it was black with the uh the the yellowish and orange v that was  like a lightning bolt came down the philadelphia flyers when they were they wore hockey slacks  slacks hockey slacks actually experimented with pants on the ice why would you do that i don't 
[01:00:00]  know it was like 83 84 awful idea i got one and tried beating the uh chicago white socks uh wearing  shorts oh that was remember when they wore shorts one season or was it for a weekend i don't know  yeah you slid into second base right open your knee they wore shorts as part of their uniform beat  that one why beat that one okay that says the islanders when they the islanders when they changed  their logo that all the logo that was really really bad it was it looked like the uh what gorton's a 
[01:00:30]  gloucester fisherman right and uh a lot of people didn't like that when the jets changed too to that 80s  stupid looking uh uh helmet logo instead of the classic uh that's that bombed too  hmm all right well that's a little question that we'll try to answer today hey uh you hear what  bush did yesterday ended tear well by the way his approval rating went up one one point one point 
[01:01:00]  after all that craziness that happened last week i flew i flew to baghdad he flies the most recognizable  aircraft into baghdad to celebrate the the death and talk to mauser cowie talk to the head muckety  muck over there that didn't even know he was coming right can you imagine riding in that in  the air force one you're the president and you're just seeing ocean ocean ocean then all of a sudden  you're coming over the mediterranean sea and you just start seeing sand you're like dude land this  thing land it immediately wow they got one of it like his best pilot the guy that knows all the 
[01:01:30]  maneuvers and they have to do that thing where they're zigging and zagging and diving but it's air  force one seven forty seven it's air force one it's got like that metallic chrome bottom the blue  all of you don't you can't say you never see air force one and go is that air force one it's so  obvious it is and then he got into some helicopter why would some unmarked why would they make it so  obvious i would like paint the plane like it's air jamaica or just bring them in and something else 
[01:02:00]  like who's gonna waste like uh a rocket on an air jamaica flight it goes to show you that flight  is so long he wants the comforts of his plane because they could take him over in a military  plane but paint the outside something different he's got all those phones and all that crap that  you got to have in that them yeah maybe that's your comforts yeah you need to bring the red button  with you right there's a lot of things you need that uh that button uh the atomic war button  that's what i go in like an old eastern airlines eastern the wings of man right right

[01:04:00]  man the astros from the 80s they had those ugly ass orange colors and they were just off yeah i kind  of remember this it almost looked like like you you should be break dancing in it right it was like  rainbow uh yeah during the 80s okay people went for that whole 80s colorful thing those were horrific  and they had the orange helmets but then like all the rappers jay-z and them started wearing the  throwback so it actually made it cool the throwbacks are cool now yeah you're actually i remember i was 
[01:04:30]  young then so yeah i started thinking it was cool but we could do this bit all day because now everyone's  calling from their city with their you know what but before bay buccaneers that's what someone's  saying what was that one about oh they had like fluorescent like why do you know what color was  like a peach orange kind of pants and they had like that stupid pirate on the side with the daggers in  his teeth or something yeah oh who came up with that mess spaniard spaniard with a knife or something 
[01:05:00]  looking for the fountain of youth baby you want to line up against us a lot of people are saying uh  tampa bay buccaneers yeah that's a bad one that was horrible uh before we move on because we can do  this all day but uh this is a good observation tom in boston go ahead you're next on the open anthony  show hello boys hey anything from uh the nba probably like 87 or something yeah who had the bright idea  to have the nba players in there in the short shorts oh yeah oh yeah um a pack of lifesavers with

[01:11:00]  well everyone's pal adam ferrari everybody he's at the stress factory this weekend in new brunswick  new jersey with that stupid phone number seven three two five four five  ha ha ha ha ha h a lot of dignity in my job  ha ha please i knew adam uh i was working uh construction and adam was uh trying to figure 
[01:11:30]  out what he wanted to do after college and that spanned the globe oh boy until you found comedy  thank god you found comedy because you were on the road to ruin my friend he came over my house once  and i was just a dirt bag the two and i'm gonna say two because so were you i know uh i i was a  dirt bag i couldn't pay my rent i'm living in an apartment we used to call peewee's playhouse  it was just people would walk in we'd be watching tv the coffee table covered with beer cans we'd stack 
[01:12:00]  them up like a pyramid drink and the door would fly open and one of our friends would come rolling in  and shooting those plastic dart guns at us which we all had on us at all times because you might get  assaulted like this and a firefight with these dart guns would break out and then you know when you  ran out of darts the war was over and we'd sit down and watch tv and drink beer and that was pretty  much what our lives were all about but he hooked up with a gig where he's selling what are you doing  to this week adam and i'm selling optics like what the what optics optics yep you need binoculars 
[01:12:30]  what do you need yeah i got everything so i'm like well that sounds good how's it going for you  great great next week adam how's the optics the optics what are you out of your mind now  water filters purifiers water purifiers the water you're drinking the water you're drinking  is filthy i go okay so what does this entail all you gotta do is this and he'd make this thing like 
[01:13:00]  he's clutching something between his thumb and forefinger and turning it a quarter turn  uh clockwise he goes all you got to do is this  and i'd be like what what does that mean what happened it's as easy as it's that easy hook up  a filter you give me 1995 you will have pure water pure water he's selling water filters he was like a  fuller brush man i did everything everything this guy did and then uh it was a comedy contest it's 
[01:13:30]  some dive in a movie yeah we don't have to make no movie ralph how hard could it be that's what he  was the ralph cramden of our crew and and then there was a comedy uh competition that was out on  long island some dumping comac yeah he goes uh over there and he like you did very well yeah i won  that you won that one and they sent him out on the water filters yeah and no more no more optics or 
[01:14:00]  water filters no more scams and no more seeing adam it's like adam where are you i'm going out to la  i'm doing it hollywood and and it it really went quickly after that like you started getting a lot  of gigs you picked up management and then adam was the guy that like we're sitting around still you know  waiting for a friend to come to the door with the dart gun drinking the beer going how the hell did adam  pull that off we use just as much of a dirt bag as we are and he's out there you know on the road i 
[01:14:30]  see him on tv i'm seeing him doing things what the hell happened you bastard yeah you know what's  funny the i'm listening to that story and the odds of one guy getting out of that that that oh that  whole thing of yeah the whole life that scenario from cops yes exactly what it was and two of you  got out just living paycheck to paycheck just barely hanging on you know and most of it went to beer and  toys we love we would be this is how irresponsible we were we'd get paid like a pittance for the crap 
[01:15:00]  jobs that we had to do thursdays yeah drunk and we we'd run out grab a bunch of beer and then  instead of doing things like electric bills and things rent stuff like that we would run to toys  r us and buy toys there was a day we just wander around toys r us and we'd come home with a slot car  set yeah and set it up and get drunk and play with slot cars while the landlord was banging on the  please tell uh everyone how old you are by the way because if you're like 22 23 most people like 
[01:15:30]  yeah of course uh probably late i was in my late 20s early 30s and you i was mid-20s you were mid-20s  so and it's funny i had friends and my brother so you can play with race cars i'm thinking yes  oh it's still happening right out of college go to toys r us and we're still not a grown-up and then we  would come back individually and the and the guys that worked it i don't have a bigger dart gun i'm sorry yeah  we try to buy better guns to shoot the other guys better because you needed a better arsenal  jim laird bought a shotgun version of the dark gun and sawed it off like like it's a sawed-off shot he 
[01:16:00]  come rolling in the door it was ridiculous it was just a life on the road to ruin yeah it was like  peter sellers when cato would attack him when he came home yeah yeah just surprised me any minute  someone could jump out of a laundry room and shoot you that's and and i was twenty thousand dollars  in credit card debt because for some reason they they gave me a credit card what they gave me one  credit card uh with uh four thousand dollar limit on it and once i started chalking that up they sent 
[01:16:30]  me another one and another one and they sent me twenty thousand dollars worth of credit cards and i  used every bit of it and i'm talking buying like cd players uh uh camcorders uh helicopters  just buying crap i remember i was making 300 bucks a week they gave me a credit card limit of  like five grand yeah how are you gonna ever trying to end your life they just want you to get you on  that they are and i said to myself i'm like i can never pay this off like i'm paying the minimum i 
[01:17:00]  think on each card was 60 bucks or 80 bucks or something like that a month and and i didn't have  anything you know at some point i was out of work i would i worked as a pool installer for a while  where you know i'm not even like in the ground pool where it takes some skill above i was installing  above the ground pool in in pools in just white trash long island yards and it was awful making no 
[01:17:30]  money couldn't pay my credit card bills or anything just a constant mess and then radio came along and  it was like you know they got hooked up with opi excuse me opi came along that's it that's right  not radio let me tell you something other radio guys could have had you but they were too stupid  that's right because you were doing a lot of radio shows but those asses with their big egos couldn't  see the future all right i saw the future let me bring something up savior no i'm not i'm just saying  that i saw the future that there's other guys out there that were dummies that you know didn't see 
[01:18:00]  you're in there they are there is a little savior in there of course but i want to bring up something  about the savior at this point i uh uh when i first started going to b.a.b. where opi worked and doing  the show i assumed for some reason that anyone that was on the radio was rich i just assumed that if  you were on the radio you were rich uh so he'll be a big day for me invited me over to the house to  watch all this uh this story it was to what was that movie that the guy died filming um uh 
[01:18:30]  brandon lee brandon lee yeah the crow the crow i invite you over to see crow see the crow on video  yeah i was very excited it's opi from b.a.b. inviting me over to his uh place and i'm like  he put a roofie in your dress yeah yeah it sounded creepy he walked in there was it sounds creepy to  me i don't remember this actually you just invited me over to talk about the show yeah there's somebody  else there and watching uh the crow or something like that so you know just talking about like how you  know the future of the show and stuff back rubs pretty cool yeah back rubs too men you put on 
[01:19:00]  these handcuffs i'm gonna drill a hole in your head and poor terreno in it your magic trick  so i assume uh because he lived in northport which is a pretty nice nice town of long  island town on long island north shore right on the water it's one of those sleepy towns sleepy  towns everyone's very sleepy but i'm i'm assuming you know like gated this big mansion i'm gonna be  pulling up too because now he's on the right yeah you mia walk this way if i could walk that way 
[01:19:30]  i had a name in long island radio yeah you gotta tell the people so i had a little name for myself  doing my own little thing not as nothing like what we're doing today obviously but as far as long  island radio goes i was i was doing all right you were like the guy that has his own mattress commercial  with that yeah there you go you knew the guy crazy opie you knew the guy isn't opie's nighttime  attitude the people knew the show knew the guy knew the name a lot of attitude with that famous if you  squint a lot of attitude and uh i put so i i i figure it wow this is the coolest thing i'm actually 
[01:20:00]  gonna hang out thought maybe i could get something going and get into radio because it's what i wanted  to do and i didn't want to do construction anymore so op gives me the address and i'm driving around in  in my apollo air conditioning work van because i didn't own a car because i couldn't afford  insurance or car or anything like that so i would take my work van which was only supposed to be used  for work did they ever notice i had a trailer hitch on the back to tow my jet ski that i bought with  a credit card and you're driving three thousand miles a week exactly yeah they'd be like mileage 
[01:20:30]  they would want mileage and i'm like i'll give it to you i don't think in five years i ever gave  them one mileage and i would lie about it so it would keep building up i'm like oh my god i'm telling  them i have like 63 000 miles on this and there's like 84 000 miles if they ever check i'm so fired  i had a low profile trailer hitch on there because i used to tow my jet ski and i'd get work done with  work if i was finished with the job at noon you're supposed to call in and get another job to go to 
[01:21:00]  but i'd be like i'm gonna be here all day and i go down to northport and back their work van into salt  water with my trailer take my jet ski off there i am in north port harvard just buzzing around with  my work van in the parking lot with a big trailer on it that's classic working man stiff debt 20 credit  card debt but you still have a jet ski i bought the jet ski with the credit card with one of the  eight thousand dollar credit cards that they on the jet ski in his uniform with the hat 
[01:21:30]  hey i'm going on a service call out nash roken what do you want from me leave me alone anthony why  is there seaweed in the truck and yeah by the truck started rotting away it was rusting on the back  and they're like what the hell is going on i don't know i don't know what's happening a trailer hitch that's  the bad part i don't know how to get away with that but uh yeah it was it was one of those situations  where you know just had to get out of it and opa went over the house to uh uh have this meeting and 
[01:22:00]  i'm expecting this big house i pull up to a a crap hole house and and opi has half of it  i had the top half the top half of the crappiest house and then me was after 10 years in the 10 years  in radio in the big and i assumed everybody in radio was rich so so even then i'm thinking  this has to be his summer place this has to be like he's just here in northport he got this place 
[01:22:30]  as a summer place and he has to have this winter place but no this is the vacation spot upstairs at  uncle phil's exactly but it was in northport you know so i figured no ac that was it no ac just hot  there's cats roaming around just a hot second floor apartment it was just it was off with a fan  blowing somewhere you know half the stuff i got off the sidewalk that was the first engine block in  the yard yeah that was the first inkling i got that maybe radio isn't just all glory and you know 
[01:23:00]  fortune and glory but now we're millionaires so we can just laugh  the old days did i tell you i bought that house and burnt it down just for the fun of it by the  way as we laugh we're just throwing money in the air today yes with a family still in it i paid them  off that's funny though like i oh you must get this adam like the first time you ever did like a premium 
[01:23:30]  blend and then you did a college gig and people had actually seen you on tv and they're like i can't  believe you're here yeah thinking that you you you they're like like a silly now you made it right  like my first you know and remember the mtv the half hour comedy hour and caroline's all that stuff  on a and e so i do all that i get a gig in atlantic city and i invite these guys down yeah to come  to oh here's another story same thing and what you think adam's big time comic come down atlantic city  he goes i'm playing the trop he's gonna be making 10 grand a show in the trop this guy's uh

[01:30:30]  that um he should bring some sunblock because of the uh the courts would bake him from the heat  you said the clay court clay courts would bake him from the he said the clay courts will bake him  no clay court like now clay court uh obviously tennis tennis being the u.s open he thought which  is oh my god you didn't which is not played on clay right first of all it's not played on clay 
[01:31:00]  second of all it's at the end of summer into fall it's like september he was just trying to help you  out e-rock i think he was watching roland garrison you're on a show where we're trying to you know  show the people that were kind of informed with what's going on out there i bring nothing to the  table oh e-rock what was that i bring nothing to the table okay should he bring i bring nothing to  the table sunblock from i bring nothing to the table great clay court i bring nothing to the table 
[01:31:30]  first i thought it was a little weird that he's uh telling another man that he should bring sunblock to  is this on he's very concerned about my fair skin you know the next sentence is i'll put it on you  before yeah yeah if you need someone to rub it in the only person who should be telling you that you  need sunblock is either your your uh girlfriend or your mom that's it no one else should give the  hooky you hired to be a lifeguard you know it doesn't matter how manly any of you guys are because 
[01:32:00]  i've seen it uh on the beach when it's just like guys that go to the beach and they can be there  looking to pick up chicks score maybe that night they're knocking off three in a row it doesn't  matter when you see them rubbing lotion into each other's backs on the beach done and they're yelling  no homo man like there's no girls around so you're gonna have to you know lather up my back for me what  do you want me to do yeah i'm gonna get like my back's got a guy i would sooner take a piece of seaweed  rub it into that and slap it on my back than have any guy uh any guy i've gone home with the worst sunburn 
[01:32:30]  in the middle of my back all the way down where the spine is i'm able to get my own shoulders that's  about it what are you going that far for it's time to leave the beach right but it's sunny time to leave  the no you just put it on the back of your hand in your forearm and you just do one of these i'm not  even there's a way to get back there you'll get most of it you'll get most of it i love the people  i love the people that leave the beach with that one spot they just didn't get for whatever reason and 
[01:33:00]  it's just bright red it's like dude they rubbed it off somehow walk on the beach one of them big  jackie on nasa's hats yeah then have a guy yeah one of your buds rubbing in lotion all right i haven't  gotten a sunburn in years i just gave up you gave up going out in the sun that's it you can't i just  i just gave up i remember the worst sunburns i would get my big my big forehead okay i would i  wouldn't even realize that i was getting burned right the words and then like i don't know like 
[01:33:30]  an hour after i should have been out of the sun somebody would say something remotely amusing and  i kind of put my eyebrows up it's just completely on fire pain oh yeah dude i've gotten like second  degree burns on my legs i mean it's just it's just you're kind of fair i don't understand it yeah  you're kind of fair-skinned i'm with like the sun is part of nature i just why i would be incompatible  i'm with bill man when i was at my grandma's house in waiting river growing up my my parents  didn't believe in uh in suntan lotion and all your kids are like all your whole family yeah 
[01:34:00]  those were the baby oil days oh yeah but they didn't grease the kid up well my parents were  always trying to save money so i think that's the only reason they didn't get suntan lotion for us  so um i would lay on my grandma's beach with my arms behind my head oh no exposing the most  sensitive of the fair open skin underarm sunburn the worst ever because now you have to walk around  pretty much with your arms in the air because it hurts just to you know put your arms back yeah oh  yeah i used to do my paper in the morning i would have like a i'd have a towel a washcloth like on my 
[01:34:30]  shoulders for like the bag wouldn't be digging in to these blisters on my it was just brutal are we  getting fired no oh good tom came in somebody came in that was trouble oh wait look how well dressed see  now that's a well-dressed man yeah yes i took your microphone yes tom chiasano everyone i want to  deliver this is my moment to deliver a public service man yes okay getting sunburned could kill  you mm-hmm i'm a survivor yes you don't mess around with it melanoma kills like 10 11 000 people a year 
[01:35:00]  in this country it's the most easily preventable form of cancer in the world but one of the most deadly  so use the sunscreen were you out in the sun a lot i got really badly burned twice only twice  i badly burned twice as a kid i swear it almost killed me it was stage four melanoma i had one  foot in the grave one foot out it's a long story i won't bore you with it but use sunscreen don't  mess around with the sun that's public service message everybody down but how do you come back 
[01:35:30]  from that holy yes let let the man put it on you yeah exactly put it on put away your ideas and let  your buddy rub the uh lotion matter of fact come no you know what before he does it you go no homo and  let him rub it and let him rub it in so yeah you're an advocate of having guys that lather each other  up especially if you're a fair-haired blonde you know oh so you like the fair-haired blonde men i'm  screwed i was a caddy for uh 14 years i'm screwed i'm getting checked already by uh by uh oh yeah 
[01:36:00]  absolutely i'll give you your mic back it rubs the lotion on its skin it does this whenever tom tells you  to tom does realize that this is a comedy show right this show is based on comedy even in comedy  you can have a a helpful watch how great we are we're going to bring back the funny now somehow  he literally after that happened he's like if i'm ever in a position where skin cancer is brought up  i'm gonna i have gotta come in they'll tell my story this is my mission huh no i know yeah tom went 
[01:36:30]  through all the crazy stuff we talk about you would figure maybe if somebody got molested they would they  would come in that isn't funny they're like hey guys that's not funny i i gotta stand up and talk  about what happened to me but we go we're talking about letting another man put uh suntan lotion on your  back or and tom comes in to tell us you know i can't stands no more let your friends touch you right  let them grease their hands up and touch you it's okay because when you're laying on your deathbed  right you're gonna wish another man's hands were on your back let me tell you something you don't get 
[01:37:00]  much of a tan under hospital lights my friend he was uh you can live with that regret if i only  greased weezer he was done though tom was done yeah oh my god dead pretty much amazing they were  pretty much saying it's over john amazing story he has that tone in his voice yeah that i almost died  tone he's also i think uh i think it does something to you uh makes you a little more uh puts things in  perspective well you know you listen to you listen to the tom of you know 15 years ago on on howard's 
[01:37:30]  show where he'd come in and things like got him all pissed off and stuff like that now it's more of  a time that has things in perspective a little more peter paul and mary vibe yeah a little bit you  know when you go through something like that yeah you put things in perspective well now let's bring  the comedy back to the show with the throat cancer guy oh right right we'll do that but first bill and  paramus bill what's up yeah i just want to tell you my buddy um or two of my buddies one guy asked  the other guy to put the lotion on his back down the beach and he used a dry hand to put it on 
[01:38:00]  to pretend he's putting it on and then with his other hand with the lotion he wrote gay across  very funny very good all right we're gonna try to get the funny back in uh bush bush screwed up pretty  good uh the other day really or yesterday listen uh never happens listen to this fine little news  story peter you're gonna ask that question with shades on i'm interested in the shade look seriously  all right i'll keep it then for the viewers there's no sun all right i should explain this uh perhaps an 
[01:38:30]  explanation i know they're gonna explain uh i know they're gonna explain because it's the news story  but just to get everyone on the same page so we're doing one of those uh news conferences at the white  house and uh you know the reporters stand up and one of these guys he's a younger guy stands up with  really cool shades on and that's what and bush is like what's this he's never seen this like you're  disrespecting me basic total lack of respect for the office by asking a question with you know sunglasses 
[01:39:00]  on yeah and bush was kind of like thinking he's really got this guy guy show me no respect in the end  uh the president looked like a complete ass well yeah okay so now let's uh go back to the audio  peter you're gonna ask that question with shades on i'm interested in the shade look seriously all  right i'll keep it then for the viewers there's no sun i guess it depends on your perspective okay  touche well what the president did not know is that peter watson of the la times has a rare genetic 
[01:39:30]  disorder and he is legally blind so he was wearing the shades for good reason of course the president  later found out called him apologized peter watson said hey look no big deal there's no reason to  apologize i didn't take offense i don't really advertise the fact that i'm legally blind because  of this disease yes you do when you bang into everything and wearing sunglasses in a room when  no one else is right that that spells disaster that spells eye sockets that everyone can see you kind 
[01:40:00]  of don't want the uh jose feliciano look the guys that decide they don't want to wear the glasses  and they're just because it's distracting yeah it really is distracting i know it's horrible and you  know if you're living with it uh god bless thoughts and prayers are with you absolutely absolutely thoughts  and prayers god bless wear your sunscreen everything will be fine but the uh the glasses you got to put the  glasses on please because no one's going to listen to what you're saying they're just looking going oh my god  he's looking off into eight different directions plus anybody who speaks in front of a crowd 
[01:40:30]  eventually you're going to have that moment every comedian's had that moment he looks in the crowd  look at this guy what are you retarded no is that awkward like oh no you know what i had one  what's your name son and it was a woman uh oh boy yeah well she shouldn't have been there yeah  you don't go to a comedy club then yeah if you look like a small if you and if you're bringing a  a retarded uh child to a comedy club sit in the back because just in case you know you don't want 
[01:41:00]  to put a comic in that situation can i tell you my embarrassing they never they somehow never get  it to the comedian they try to run around and there's always that one guy who just doesn't get  the memo hey hey what do you look like an idiot hey dude what do you do for a living well you're up to  you're so hypersensitive yeah you got such low self-esteem so somebody's going like you think  they're making fun of you what are you doing what the hell's with you yeah someone wipe his mouth  look at him he's drooling can i um somebody shut this guy up dude how drunk are you yeah i need to

[01:48:00]  the ad for the ad for the ad for the smoking campaign first produced six years ago in massachusetts  they are now airing in new york city i'm sure in some cases people have to look away but ad experts say  turning away from this is one thing turning it off completely is another the city of new york health  department says people are not doing that in fact the department says it's received 15 000  calls for help since the campaign began in january shut that off compared to 5 000 calls during the same 
[01:48:30]  period last year clearly um 15 000 calls to a toll-free hotline tripled the amount of what it  was before this ad air showed that it's breaking through they're just going to keep showing stuff  that he used to be able to do and he can't now i used to be able to go on a swing but now the air  comes too fast and i pass out i hyper ventilate is is it true tom chiasano is starting a new  campaign they're just going to be filming him in dark hallways don't go out in the sun

[01:50:00]  about other scary commercials where one of them i think they feature in this piece they show the little  baby plane it's real nice it's a home video oh yeah and then they show uh like graphics of when the  kid died and it was a drunk driving accident and all that it's just something horrific the volkswagen  ones are scary they show the yeah the actual crash actual accidents yeah that's pretty crazy too creepy  what channels are you guys watching regular tv bill regular tv get your head out of the sand

[01:54:30]  those uh couches except for the memories oh yes the memories i saw him on speaking of leno i saw him  on leno the other night with like a folk group yeah van halen stuff we've been all over that man  really awful was that you know it's i mean the band itself was good but then to put like that on and  mix it with the didn't make any sense to me no no that seems to be and did you hear the audience  like he was trying to go for like you know he's trying to get the audience you get the audience into  it and you could hear just complete silence yeah they didn't want to be you want to remember your 
[01:55:00]  rock stars like they were you want to remember the songs like they were right you don't want this  bluegrass version of jump wearing a banana republic i was gonna say down you never want your now you  never want your rock stars to dress like your dad yeah and do the same songs or not even the same  songs because this is a very different version you're talking about this of course we've been having  a lot of fun with this yeah 
[01:55:30]  fiddle riff annoys the crap out of me yeah it's like a mighty this is what he's doing mighty wind  yeah what was that dolly parton  listen to him wait till it kicks in oh because you need the solo right love the vocals  i get up no oh yeah oh yeah gets me down this isn't a joke to him you got it 
[01:56:00]  bill is beside himself wait you haven't heard this yet no  wait till it kicks in man wait till he says he gets to the chorus  that sounds just like weird al yankovic yeah 
[01:56:30]  that's a new thing around my joint  we walk around my apartment  please do us all a favor and jump  can you believe this how does this even how does this come to be like how does he  you know what i want to do like someone i want you know i want to get these folk musicians i want to 
[01:57:00]  read mix the jump how does that even happen it makes perfect sense if you talk to people that have  worked with him for any length of time yeah you know what it is perfect sense he's crazy these  artists they just run out of things to put out yeah you know you have a successful career and then  that's over so then you get you put out the greatest hit cd and then you put out the live cd  then you put out the second greatest hit cd that bill burr was talking about yesterday  and then it's like uh alternate yeah then you do left with then you do the b-sides the box set and  then it's like ah let's get a country you must have been listening to like led zeppelin three 
[01:57:30]  and then like the outfield or something and and he did like a little bit of acid and he's just like  yeah man that sounds like a good idea if he hadn't been the definitive rock star of the 80s of the early  80s this wouldn't be so bad if he was just some guy who's in some band right but he was the rock star  that you wanted to be you know if you were in a band or something that's what you aspire to be  david lee roth van halen right and then here's where he ended up 
[01:58:00]  oh this would be like if you went to a bluegrass night this would be like the jokes everyone would  be laughing yeah oh we got one for you like guys yeah yeah you're doing van halen hilarious  and then you go back to you know singing about an outhouse in tennessee and it all makes sense  again right swing your partner so uh david lee ross not going to be on trl with this i can't  imagine that especially with those dockers uh stain resistant khakis that he was rocking  definitely not oh we don't need to hear the whole thing but there it is that it didn't even sound 
[01:58:30]  like he was in front of a live crowd either that just sounded like well this is off the cd oh okay  wow it really was silent in the back we listened to the uh the leno wine can i see that leno actually  came out at the end is that the only one and laughed yeah he kind of laughed when he said and  uh we'd like to thank david lee ron he was trying to hold it in but yeah it had to come out a little  bit right that made a strumming with the devil happy yeah southern side of van halen strumming with 
[01:59:00]  the devil this is this is the inbred side of van halen jamie's planting they got jamie's crying the  radio edit because they get a little crazy oh yeah too crazy all right hey uh we got some britney  spears audio yeah i want to hear i saw a weeping on tv figured uh might make some fun audio she's  crying about she just ruined her entire career yeah she had something good going there now she's uh 
[01:59:30]  i know she has a lot of money blah blah blah doesn't have to put out any more cds blah blah blah  doesn't have to pour blah blah blah but she really thinks we're uh checking her out because of her uh  singing voice no no you you wrecked your body it was never about her singing it was always about  her um provocative live show pregnant woman is one of the most beautiful things on the planet yes  certainly but it's never what planet you're speaking of when she's pregnant isn't that on  rigel seven which planet are you talking about it's not earth that they say well we got spears on 
[02:00:00]  date line well in this clip spears tries to legitimize driving with baby on lap by saying her  destination was only five minutes away that's it we discussed this we have no problem with britney  spears holding uh her son as she drives because we all grew up in an era where you didn't have the  nice car seats and all where kids died by the thousands no seat belts yeah and there was no global  warming right problem right say too many kids are continuing to live taking a dump every day it ends  up in a river we need no seat belts and those metal dashboards brought back airbags waste we had that

[02:27:00]  time is that what it was dude the kind of shit people have yelled at me like i remember one time  you remember you know that guy timmy on south park i think my hair was a little too curly and it was  such a great heckle because i heard it and only a couple other tables heard it and i couldn't  address it like i just came on stage hey how's it going i hear in the back timmy and i'm like oh  shit that's really good i can't fucking address that so i just kept doing my oh damn that is good  yeah so yeah because people know you enough but they don't know who you are sometimes like 
[02:27:30]  clay aiken when like it was it was all it was going on at the time so i was pasty he's pasty so  it's just you know yeah but people sometimes do that where it's just look he's got red hair clay  aiken yeah it's like one of those uh it's like the what's up whenever i was yelling what's up that  was a big catchphrase so clay aiken was uh i'd like to think i don't look like that guy but i have  never ever thought you looked anything like clay aiken the delicate bone structure of clay aiken 
[02:28:00]  yeah not not happening with you he really is a bird isn't he can you sing bridge over troubled  waters for us please definitely the soup guy though bill bill garfunkel definitely the soup guy  yeah the soup we always do we watch the soup and we go oh look it's a happy bill burr  oh god still burn a good mood no he's in a good mood but yeah no i just i was you know i always  have angry tone it's that east coast thing yeah people always tell me that shit anytime you spend 
[02:28:30]  a lot of time rubbing your forehead going in pain yeah yeah uh no because you know what it was was  the other day somebody mentioned that i was angry which i don't mind because i am but it really annoys me  when angry people tell me that i'm angry it's like dude you're angry too you know it's hypocritical  yeah but more importantly more importantly let's get i keep thinking it's the truth of the matter i  can never remember it the truth of the matter oh boy more importantly importantly uh long long 
[02:29:00]  explanation oh i don't like long oh bill all over the place today did we do the uh wow did we do the uh  intro one two three intro live from the opian anthony show studios the daily dump report all right  let's see what happened on our fm broadcast that was dumped out of because it was dirty filthy  non-fcc compliant or maybe uh al just didn't like it at 6 18 a.m the fucking guy bill burr during the 
[02:29:30]  the naked guy discussion called him the fucking guy i guess i got confused i forgot i thought we  were talking about the villain a little confused uh the next dump coming at 7 26 a.m and take them  rectally bill burr discussing opi eating blueberries and cheese covered mini wheats you can see how that  would happen and take them rectally i kind of thought there was going to be a problem there 
[02:30:00]  7 54 a.m banging a girl with a heavy menstrual flow yeah i knew that was coming that's borderline  was it because of the banging it's the whole package uh menstrual flow describing it as heavy  right after banging a girl it's just the whole package that was me that that's an infield hit  yeah okay i wouldn't they'll grade me a little and then 7 55 jesus it's a paragraph it was all over  the walls and windows brown specks on the windowsill bill burr and adam ferrara during discussion of 
[02:30:30]  having sexual relations with a girl though they did not say she was on her period these comments made  it clear well that's what we're supposed to do when you can't say yeah yeah oh you guys don't know  radio oh boy you silly comics keep it vague enough so the dumb guy doesn't know what you're talking  about but everyone else does that's all right that's the challenge i thought the art from red bank was  great the password that made it perfect actually period you didn't have to go any further than that

[02:34:30]  and stuff you clip off that beard shave it was that close yeah yeah actually like one less guitar  lesson right exactly and he would be so this is my busy time yeah april can't tour in april other guys it  was either a rock star or you know whatever convicted felon yeah yeah exactly inmate dead in a  shooting have you seen a band name that i love i want okay what i like okay check this out savage 
[02:35:00]  animal savage animal no that's it it rolls off the tongue savage animal you should call it no  no because that's what you guys say all the time i'm a savage animal and that's what rock and roll  is it's a beast it rolls off the tongue savage and i don't i don't know whatever yeah yeah this is so 
[02:35:30]  spinal savage animal that is a stupid thing really is and on the episode before he was holding everybody  up because uh they were supposed to do a photo shoot or something and the photo shoot was postponed like two  and a half hours because he was putting on makeup and doing his hair upstairs oh boy and he went for  he went for a morning jog he's high maintenance savage that's a savage animal savage animal it's  rock and roll it's what we're about man oh he breaks the whole thing down yeah he's going to ted he's like 
[02:36:00]  you're a savage animal this band is a savage animal rock and roll is a savage animal and he really he  sold it so hard i'm just like i was starting to think it was a good name you were like yeah this  is good he's right three days i've been walking around my apartment and just out of nowhere i'll  just go savage animal sebastian he's the greatest he's got i don't know if you have the whole clip  he's like dude i don't want to think when i hear a band name like i hear god war that does that just 
[02:36:30]  makes me go like whoa well we got we got the next clip it's uh pitched to scotty and and nugent now  oh okay so the first uh the first uh clip was pitched to the manager and jason bono oh okay  trying to get them on board now he goes to scotty and and ted nugent you got a band-aid band name  what when i say the name of it just give me five seconds i'm not saying a word okay  savage animal dude it rolls up it sounds like a band that's what they can't do you think 
[02:37:00]  i like something to have good diction i like it to roll off the tongue cool savage animal it rolls  off my tongue that's the only reason i really like it it's a redundancy and i like the name maybe that  speaks to my ego you know and to me god ward it's almost too depressing it doesn't make me happy i don't  go like this god i go god yeah i understand savage animal there's two types of obviouses in the world 
[02:37:30]  ones that are really perfect and ones that are really really wrong and to me it's too predictable  i'm a savage animal this band is a savage wall to wall rock and roll is a savage animal  it rolls off my tongue yeah i had some green slime rolling off my tongue this morning so  running off your tongue doesn't necessarily mean good oh they really don't like it hey he was the 
[02:38:00]  only one huh ted nugent sound a lot like uh hugh hefner these days anyone else uh pick up on that  just a tad let's go to peter in massachusetts peter hey p let's go peter hey i got a name for this  band it's called washed up washed up man dude give me five seconds rolls off the tongue five seconds  has-beens i'm a has-been you're a has-been the rock and roll we play 
[02:38:30]  oh brother bill bravo this is really good  all right so now he tries to pitch it to the whole band here  he's just fucking relentless give up give up adam next time i have to pitch a tv show i'm watching  this clip that's what it got if you have the conviction of sebastian box you're going to get  something on air it's just why did you buy this you should have seen him in the room he was a savage  animal the way he was pitching all right here we go this show sucks this network sucks tv sucks 
[02:39:00]  why wouldn't it work tv sucks name of our band pilot episode we're all trapped in a cabin  oh me and bill have the trapped in a cabin uh episode uh yeah that's an inside joke with writers  when you know the show is run its course after five years or something when they do the trapped in the  cabin episode well the variation in the basement with archie and meathead 
[02:39:30]  yeah find the bottle wherever lady bunch greg stuck in the meat locker up yeah anytime you're  trapped somewhere and have to either do a retrospective right or some type of you it gives  you time to think back to do some flashback thing some characters in rehab we got to come up with  something horror some woman's having a baby too the baby is always a big yeah there you go elevator  yeah stuck in an elevator episode just means cancel the show savage animal  love it here's the pitch to the entire band by around three o'clock we got to have some sort 
[02:40:00]  of name or something that we're going to go with because it's just time to get it out  well as far as i'm concerned whether we like it or not we are god war the pr guys are already running  with it it's our name if we haven't agreed i'm telling you right now i don't like i'm not gonna hype  that name i i don't like the name god war well we certainly decided that we don't like the name  now it was a little strange that we had the big meeting about god war and then spaston didn't like  the name it's depressing to me god it's raw dog spelled backwards bro i think it's a depressing name 
[02:40:30]  he's easily depressed spaston it just sounded really too monolithic for him but hey if someone  in the band hates it that's not the name because then that guy's gonna be miserable forever i was  happy with this savage animal what's wrong with you guys you are a savage animal rock and roll  is a savage animal oh my god come on it's got a good ring to it 
[02:41:00]  what's wrong with you people you know what you got a joke you got a joke you think it's funny but  doesn't get a laugh so you keep repeating the punch oh yeah yeah yeah it doesn't matter every  night sell it well bill you do that joke like come on people come on people get with me on our show  like you and whatever god war it's something you wear on your fucking arm you don't put it on a  fucking turntable you know i'm getting way into the show now because now i agree with him god  war stinks as a name as well yeah not that it matters you like savage animal no i don't like savage 
[02:41:30]  animal but i'm starting to like it he keeps saying savage it's the way he says it rock and  roll he just so much conviction you could just picture him because he wants to jump on stage and  go we are savage animal and just like really get the crowd into it if it was 1982 elo syndication  elo give me five seconds before you say anything before you say anything syndication  syndication what that's kind of redundant man syndication i'm thinking exclusivity 
[02:42:00]  and now here is the band settling on uh how about douche chills jimmy jakes from whack bag  here's uh the band settling on the name if we waited for everybody to agree on everything we do  them democracy but you can't use them how democracy 
[02:42:30]  And then, oh, that's democracy.  I like that.  Damn, that's good.  Democracy.  I like that.  Damn, I love democracy.  Democracy.  Sebastien just made it up, damn, democracy.  I was like, that's the name.  Dude, I can't believe it came out of your s**t.  I don't even have a brain.  I love it.  It's an interaction, it's an interaction.  Good thing I didn't get that God War tattoo last night. 
[02:43:00]  So what's the name of the band?  Damnocracy.  Didn't he say he wanted a name you didn't have to think about or anything?  Damnocracy?  That's not really good.  It's like democracy with damn in front of it, man.  Yeah, a little attitude.  Because he's angry about the system.  He's angry.  Wow.  That savage animal that you get picked up.  A band angry at the system.  Yeah, man.  I got to admit, man, I fucking love Sebastian Bach because it's not phony.  He really, like, he really believes it. 
[02:43:30]  But the first episode, he had this whole idea how they were going to come on stage.  And he's just pitching it to them.  And they're all just sitting there like, yeah, I don't know about this.  He goes, no.  And then the smoke comes up.  And he points to Scott Ian.  And then you start going like, digga, digga, digga.  And Scott's just looking at him.  So then, of course, he just pitches the same thing again.  And when he gets to the part where Scott Ian's supposed to start playing his guitar,  Scott actually started playing.  He's going like, digga, digga.  And he just goes like, yeah.  And he fucking flips.  I mean, flips the fuck out. 
[02:44:00]  Know what that's all about?  He still has passion to do it.  The rest of the guys are like, I just want some time on TV.  It's hilarious.  Like, when they rehearse, like, Jason Bonham's going,  I've never worked with a guy who, like, does, like, all the fucking stage moves  as you're, like, rehearsing.  Like, you're in front of 30,000 fucking people.  And they're just sitting there, you know.  They're, like, leaning.  They're, like, drinking Starbucks.  They're playing this shit.  And Sebastian is going fucking bananas.  Throwing kicks.  Yeah, exactly.  He's pointing at his drummer.  And they're just going, like, easy, mate. 
[02:44:30]  Save it for the show.  Save it.  Here's Eric in New York.  Eric.  Hey, good morning, boys.  I got a band name for them that rolls really off your tongue.  Super Califragilisticexpialidocious.  Man, car crash.  Not even worthy.  That's a bus crash.  Someone said Savage Animals is a little too much like Wild Stallions,  which is Bill and Ted's band.  Oh, okay.  Wild Stallions.  Wild Stallions. 
[02:45:00]  The mamas and the papas.  Yeah, it's like if you say any name like that, it's going to sound awesome.  Peter, Paul, and Mary.  Caja, Google.  Go.  Just give me five seconds.  Caja, go, go.  Air supply.  Right.  You need air.  I need air.  We all need air.  Fucking air supply.  Air supply, dude. 
[02:45:30]  We all breathe it.  It's like air, man.  It's like a scene from Animal House, that famous scene, right?  Those guys.  What's the scene from Animal House where he just starts ranting like that?  Oh, where Pluto goes off.  Leave him alone.  He's on a roll.  Leave him alone.  He's on a roll.  Yeah.  There you go.  Britney Spears.  Your name is Helen, but Britney Spears.  By the way, Scott Ian follows Ted Nugent around like a little schoolgirl and idolizes him.  Who does?  Scott Ian. 
[02:46:00]  Oh.  That's the thing.  I make fun of this show, but I like all those guys on the show.  They're like, they're funny.  Ted Nugent's a little, I don't know.  I have fun with Ted when he comes on our show.  I enjoy him.  I just don't understand how you can be a rebel when you're in your 50s.  I don't agree with a lot of the things he's saying, but I love that he can talk.  And he believes it, too.  At least he's like, you know.  Oh, man, does he believe it.  Absolutely, he does.  I just don't see how you're a rebel that you like shooting squirrels.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's neat, man.  Let's take a break. 
[02:46:30]  Fucking kill it.  Our smoothies are here.  What?  Bigger.  Oh, whatever.  You know what I mean?  You're supposed to.  Yeah, but it's not a sport.  The animals aren't aware they're playing.  This is true.  Why don't we take a break?  It's like you're doing the walkover and someone's shooting at you.  Oh, 10 points for that one.  I'm like, what the hell?  I'm hunting.  I wasn't even ready.  Right.  I think we're going to play superhero going into break.  We started the show off today by talking about Naked Man.  Naked Man, a superhero we'd like to see. 
[02:47:00]  Would he be a superhero?  And then they reminded us of a little Stephen Lynch song.  So Stephen Lynch is coming in tomorrow.  Hence us featuring some Stephen Lynch songs today.  Because I don't think he's going to be playing any of his Goofy songs anymore.  Yeah, I want to hear him do Kill a Kitten or Special Olympics now that he's on Broadway.  A big Broadway star.  But here's Stephen Lynch doing superhero.  Savage.  If I could be a superhero, I would be an awesome man.  I'd fly around the world fighting crime according to my awesome plan. 
[02:47:30]  And if I saw criminals trying to lie, hurting other people and making them cry,  I'd haul them off to jail in my awesome van.  Because I would be an awesome man.  Yeah.  Then I say kids, now you know.  We all know that when people offer you drugs and alcohol, like me, you just say no, right?  If I could be a superhero, I would be a drug-free boy. 
[02:48:00]  Telling the world of the evils of drugs and all of the lives they destroy.  Well, I'd take all the junkies getting so high with their needles and bongs and their sticks made of Thai.  As I burn them alive, I would squeal with joy.  Because I would be drug-free boy.  If I could be a superhero, I'd be immigration dude. 
[02:48:30]  I'd send all the foreigners back to their homes for eating up all of our food.  And taking our welfare and best jobs to boot, like landscaping, dishwashing, picking our fruit.  I'd pass a lot of laws to get rid of their brood.  Because I'd be immigration dude. 
[02:49:00]  Now you have the kids imagine what superhero they would be.  They could be any superhero.  If you could be a superhero, would you be a justice guy?  Making sure people get what they deserve, especially women who lie.  Like if a wife left her husband with three kids and no job.  To run off to Hawaii with some doctor named Bob.  You could skin them and drain them of blood so they'd die. 
[02:49:30]  Especially Bob.  Then you would be a justice guy.  Or you could be more subtle.  I didn't mean to be vague.  Give her the mad cow disease.  Let him die of the plague.  As long as they suffered for their horrible lie.  Especially Bob.  Then you would be justice guy.  Yes, then you would be a superhero like me. 
[02:50:00]  See you then, lads.  There you go.  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today?  Cancel all avoidments.  Welcome to Radio 3 America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath.  I'm over here now. 
[02:50:30]  Back again.  Nice head, dick.  Back.  Baggett.  Jesus, back.  Oh, man.  Back again.  I don't believe it.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  Jesus, back.  Jesus, back.  Back, back.  Back looking.  Yes, who's back.  So afraid. 
[02:51:00]  Yes, who's back.  Yes, who's back.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Burn it off?  Yes, who's back.  Yes, who's back.  Burn it off.  Oh, man.  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now.  What's all doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  So stay on top of me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little hope.  Hey!  Because it feels so empty without me.  I'm saying this looks like a job for me.  So everybody, just follow me. 
[02:51:30]  If we need a little hope.  Hey!  Because it feels so empty without me.  Give me an answer.  Okay, cut.  All right, here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  You better go away.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best that I did.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  Now go away.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best that I ever did. 
[02:52:00]  That's what it makes sense.  He's really funny, there.  Now go away!  I remember these guys.  We're in, we're in, we're in.  I remember these guys.  Oh.  It's just these guys.  The infamous Liberator.  Has made its way into the studio.  What happened to O'Benz 2?  It's frozen right now.  You better get the cams going on Pal Talk because we have Sunset Thomas stopping in 
[02:52:30]  to say hi.  And Rebecca Love.  I wonder if that's her real name.  Ecuador's up 1-0 against Costa Rica.  Yes!  In case anybody cares.  Are you kidding?  Oh, yeah.  Did you say 1-0 again?  1-0.  Sorry.  Oh, my God, Bill.  It's my first week of World Cup coverage.  Bill, they're going to kill you now.  The Krauts won last night.  1-0.  All right.  And we also have Uncle Al here.  Al Jorgensen.  Ministry is in the house. 
[02:53:00]  And there's a story about fucking an ostrich we have to get to, according to Steve.  Let's say hi to Dave in Boston.  Dave.  What's up, you rat bastards?  What's up, Dave?  Hey, man.  I just want to give you guys your Boston update.  You guys were on the Herald this morning saying that after Marconi left and then Roth was a  disaster.  And then Daryl calling you guys the dynamic duos and saying that you get triple the advertisement  rates that with Roth.  Oh.  Oh, we're making money for BCN. 
[02:53:30]  That's nice to hear.  Yeah.  Nice press for you.  Have you ever talked about that time you were on Fox 25 and that homeless guy stole your  spot?  Oh, me?  Yeah.  I actually gave you guys a tape of that.  We never played that audio.  Oh, I remember my stupid manager brought it over and there was nothing on it.  It's like a visual thing, too.  You really need to see your face is so priceless.  Savage animal.  Savage animal.  What is it?  It's a local interview and then a homeless guy comes walking onto the set or something? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  And I just kind of interacted with him.  I think I gave him a dollar in the end of it.  Yeah.  But that was a while ago.  Yeah.  My manager brought it over and it didn't have anything on it.  So I...  Great.  Who's the old guy out there?  Huh?  Who's the old guy?  Where?  Who's the old guy?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Who is the old guy?  Who is that?  Ask him who he is and who he's with.  Psst.  Who is that?  Who's the old guy?  Psst.  We get uncomfortable when there's old guys around. 
[02:54:30]  Why?  You guys don't know radio.  Yeah.  Because they make references that, you know, we don't get.  All right.  E-Rod's got the report.  Yeah.  But it's fun to scare old people.  You boys like government cheese.  His name is Eddie.  He's with Sunset Thomas.  What do you mean with?  What?  What do you mean with?  I asked him.  I was like, what does that mean?  He just points out and he goes with.  I said, okay.  And came back in the studio.  What is that about?  So we know he's rich. 
[02:55:00]  All right.  What do you want to do?  You want to bring in Uncle Al and then we'll bring in Sunset and Rebecca Love.  All right.  All right.  Let's get Uncle Al in here.  He's drinking his red wine.  Don't you love when you Google Opie and Anthony to see if the new stush is there and it's shortlist  announced for 2006 Edinburgh TV Fest and it's Anthony Fry and Lisa Opie?  Ow!  There he is.  What are you knuckleheads doing?  What's up? 
[02:55:30]  Seems like only yesterday I was here.  Yeah.  Is that a sec-sack pier or is that good if I sit here?  A little of both.  Wait, I remember you.  It's okay if you sit there and...  That's my wife, Angie.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the one that hasn't divorced me yet.  Yeah.  Angie, Zal's wife.  And she just asked.  Ask again.  We got the wireless mic.  Angie.  Is it going to be a live sec-sack pier or can I sit on this shay lounge?  Well, you can sit for now.  Let's just put it that way.  Do you want to see a live sec-sack?  There has been.  Would your wife like to see a live sec-sack?  Oh, yeah.  With me? 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, all the time.  Yeah.  I'm not renting her out or anything.  No.  No.  We got other people for the sex act that she just wants to watch it.  Bring him in.  All right.  We're going to bring that in in a minute.  A little bit.  The same zone.  There you go.  Sex chair.  All right.  We haven't met this guy yet.  Who are you?  I'm Raven.  Bass player from Ministry.  Yeah.  Right on, man.  Also from Killing Joke.  Killing Joke.  Oh, no kidding.  Oh.  Killing Joke's a shit.  Yeah.  He's a limey bastard.  Yeah.  I'm a teabag.  I'm a teabag.  He's a teabagger.  I can hear that.  You guys like the wine, too. 
[02:56:30]  Just enough.  Yep.  Well, they're still drunk from last night.  The wine.  Is that it?  You guys didn't make it to the show.  It was kick-ass.  Nah, not last night.  We have to be in bed by 8.30, man.  Yeah.  We go to bed when you wake up.  We're faggots.  Got to go to bed at 8 o'clock at night to get up at 4 in the morning.  You guys are still going off.  Maybe for once we can at least act cool and go, yeah, man.  We stay up all night, then we come in here.  Yeah.  Have our smoothies. 
[02:57:00]  That's right.  Have your smoothies.  I missed the show.  He's got a bottle of wine.  I woke up with a...  I've got a needle in my arm.  Right.  Way to go, Courtney Opie.  Yeah.  Courtney Opie.  Fucker.  Oh, and you're right.  You're right, though.  Yeah.  But you guys are sipping the red wine.  That's a little weird.  No, it's not weird if you're still drunk from the night before.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Yeah, that's taking it down like 81 notches for them.  Yeah, that's all.  Is drinking wine at like 9, 30, 10 in the morning.  We're on the jacket about 7. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, that's like orange juice.  That's orange juice for rock stars.  Hey, there's probably more vitamins than there is in that orange juice.  That's right.  Vitamin G, man.  There you go.  Vitamin G, Bill.  Antioxidants.  That's right.  Cancer away.  It helps the heart, too.  Right there, Al.  I heard all that shit.  Al, we've been playing your stories ever since you left last time.  We do story time with Uncle Al.  All right.  Hey, what's the ostrich story about?  Oh, no.  Steve comes running in here and goes. 
[02:58:00]  All right, guys.  I don't know if America's ready for this one.  Savage animal.  Yeah.  Well, an ostrich.  It is.  Fucking animal.  Is there a city ordinance about bestiality stories?  No, no, no.  At 4 noon, I can do a bestiality story?  You just can't show it.  You just can't show it.  Well, that's what that couch is for.  You got the ostrich, too.  That's fine.  Whatever we can find.  Road kill.  Look, God.  This is the sickest thing.  Look, man.  A story's a story.  We don't know if it really happened. 
[02:58:30]  No, no, it happened.  There's going to be no lie detector test being taken here.  I'll take it here.  It happened.  It was.  Oh, it happened.  He wants to admit it happened.  I completely believe it.  I was trying to help you guys out.  I'm not over this shit.  And I've seen a lot of shit in my life.  Yeah.  When did this happen?  This.  Last tour in Europe.  Yeah.  Pretty weird.  All right.  So, we dropped a couple tabs of acid, okay?  Of course.  You're going to Europe.  We're on tour, and we're in Europe.  What else are you going to do?  That's their multivitamin.  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  That goes with the antioxidants in the wine, right?  It goes in the bush mills.  It's cancer saving.  There you go.  Yeah.  We dropped a couple tabs, and we went to a zoo.  All right?  I'm not going to name the city in Europe, because in case this ostrich is pregnant or something,  I don't want them to get back to us.  Amsterdam.  Amsterdam.  Amsterdam.  Amsterdam.  But I'm with my keyboard tech, and we decide, like, we're so wasted on this Sid, right?  We decide, like, we're going to hide in the bathroom and wait until, like, security closes  the place down. 
[02:59:30]  So, it's nighttime.  We're walking around this empty zoo trying to dodge security people.  That rocks right off the bat.  We walk past, and we're tripping balls.  We walk past this fence, and there's a goddamn ostrich with its head in the sand or dirt or  whatever, just totally, like, ass in the air, and my keyboard tech goes apey, jumps the fence.  I don't even know what the hell he's doing.  He goes there, unzips, drops trout, and tries to put his dick in an ostrich that's sleeping. 
[03:00:00]  Like, what is he thinking?  Is the ostrich not going to wake up and he'll get a quick shag?  I mean, first of all, how do you get hard when walking past an ostrich with its ass in  the air?  You wouldn't even think of that.  And second of all, what is the ostrich pussy versus the ostrich ass?  He may be gay.  I have no idea, man.  You don't know where he's shoving it.  So, he pulls his pants down to his knees and puts his dick in this ostrich, and this  ostrich was pissed.  Well, what did you mean?  What did you mean? 
[03:00:30]  The thing...  No lube.  No, no lube, nothing.  No lube.  No lube.  No lube.  No lube.  No lube.  That's just rude.  That ostrich is like a horde.  The thing gets his head out of it.  It's like, hurr, like Scooby-Doo hurr, pulls his head out and is pissed off and starts kicking  the living shit out of him.  He's trying to run from it, but his pants are down to his knees so he can't run.  And I'm tripping my brains out.  I'm just like, this is fucked up.  This has scarred me for life, dude.  I had to climb the fence and distract the ostrich. 
[03:01:00]  He's a rodeo guy.  So, it comes after me, and these things kick like a motherfucker.  Yeah, they'll rip you apart.  I was just like, what the hell's going on here?  So, we had to help each other over the fence, and this ostrich would not quit.  It was throwing itself against the chain link.  Would you?  Trying to get...  Yeah, of course.  If you're trying to nap and someone sticks their dick in you, I'm not stopping either.  I'm going to kick some fucking ass.  The best part is he didn't say a word. 
[03:01:30]  He just went past the ostrich, saw the ass in the air, and got hard, and said nothing.  Just jumped the fence.  I was like, what are you fucking doing?  The next thing I know, it's...  You get a song out of that, or what?  Not yet.  It's a double album coming up.  Yeah, he's not wrong.  It's going to be on a double live album.  Wow.  There's ministry with that new one, Ostrich Rape.  Dude, you, you, you, like I do.  You know what scares me about bestiality is like that, uh, have you ever seen that Hugh 
[03:02:00]  Manzi?  Oh, my God.  Oliver.  Oliver, the Chimp Manzi?  You've never seen that?  No, no.  What's that about?  It's too freaky.  Somebody had sex with a chimp, and the cagotes kind of mixed right, and it's totally creepy.  He's like an upright walking chimp that smokes cigarettes.  Oh, I didn't hear about that.  I didn't hear about that.  It's grotesque.  I think you can find that on the internet, yeah.  I gotta see this, man.  You gotta go for humans.  That can't be real.  No, they've been trying... 
[03:02:30]  There is no...  That can't be real.  No, I swear.  Hold on, they're onto something.  They've been trying to prove...  There's a custody battle.  They're trying to figure out...  There is a custody battle going on.  No, they're right.  They're trying to figure out what this...  If it's really just a human being, and something got screwed up, or if there's some ape shit in there.  Do you understand the laws of nature?  No one will fess up.  It can't happen.  No one will fess up.  That's the thing.  But there are certain laws of nature...  No, no, but that's what I'm afraid of.  ...that prevents that from happening.  That's why we'll not name the zoo in case if there's, like, an ostrich boy that came out. 
[03:03:00]  No, I don't mean laws like arresting law and metal.  I don't mean laws that keep fucking ostrich that plays the bass.  Right.  Dude, I don't know anything about it.  Laws that keep a penguin fish...  A seven-foot basis with a huge and very thin legs.  That likes to wear bullets.  That's me.  That's me.  That's me.  That's what I'm doing here.  That's right.  That actually is me.  No, no.  All right, Ann, I know.  There is just no...  Hey, where's the sex act? 
[03:03:30]  When's that happen?  Yeah.  Come on, bring him in.  Keep the bird.  By the way, you guys are heading up to...  Bring in the monkey.  You guys are heading up to Worcester?  When?  I don't know.  We go to Atlantic City.  What day is today?  I don't know.  AC.  Well, I'm trying to promote for you guys.  I'll quit show and let's talk.  Well, June 16th in Worcester.  Maybe...  Lock up your pets.  And then June 17th, House of Blues, Atlantic City.  What is it?  The Troopers?  Man, you want to know how much I could not do that?  I could not sit in a bathroom in a closed area, tripping, waiting for a zoo to close. 
[03:04:00]  I have a heart attack just doing that.  Not only did you guys do that, you waited and walked by.  It was all good until he wigged out on me and just had like a boner.  Some ostrich can just fuck up everything, can't they?  He saw an ostrich ass, got a boner, and freaked out on me.  Yeah, but he was tripping.  He didn't see an ostrich ass.  No, no, that was like, that's an excuse.  Feathered pussy.  Oh, I'm tripping, man.  Ostriches look great.  No, there is no excuse for that.  Yeah, you're right.  That's fucked up.  His story was the ostrich was asking for it. 
[03:04:30]  They'll do that.  What do you think's going to happen?  The thing had garters on it.  That time at night?  Yeah.  Dude, you didn't hear that ostrich talking to me?  He just dropped a couple of feather dusters.  It was asking for it.  Oh, no.  It was asking for it with his ass up in the air like that, sticking its head down.  That's the only thing I think of.  He said no, it really meant yes.  And moralized it or whatever and just thought like, wow, man, wouldn't it be great to have  a chick with her ass in the air like that and her head in the sand and just went off,  only it happened to be an off.  Hey, I've got to ask you guys, so anything else in the zoo that night? 
[03:05:00]  No, we got the hell out of there.  That's got to be creepy to walk around a zoo at night with no one around.  Especially tripping.  That was insane.  You dare each other to go into like the lion cage a little bit?  No, we weren't even talking.  It was just like, we didn't say a word.  We were just walking around going, whoa, dude.  Dude, can you imagine?  Jurassic Park, dude.  I know.  I just fucked a John ostrich.  What are you telling me for?  These guys fucked up.  I love it.  Can you imagine how fucking quiet that must have been in a zoo, just you in the hand? 
[03:05:30]  Oh, ah!  Yeah.  No, it was really creepy, dude.  It was completely creepy and then it just got bizarre.  It all happened like in a split instant and what do you do?  You're watching your friend dropping trowel on an ostrich.  So it's like, and then the thing gets pissed and you got to divert it.  So I had to climb the fence too and get in there and like wave my hands.  He sounds like one of those dudes in the extra, one of the extras in the accused who like  watched the rape.  It all happened so fast. 
[03:06:00]  I don't know what happened, man.  I mean, I was over there playing pinball and the next thing you know.  I know.  Everything was fine and it was interspecies rape.  On a pool table.  On a pool table.  The ostrich look like Kelly McGillis.  You can catch ministry at the Flamingo.  You can arrest ministry at the Flamingo.  Start out with something like a meerkat or something smaller than an ostrich.  No, no, I have animals.  I don't approve of this. 
[03:06:30]  This was something that was spontaneous.  Now you're going out on a limb.  No, I'm seriously taking a stand on this.  You're seriously saying fucking animals is wrong.  Right.  Wow.  I know.  Call me square.  You're going to catch some shit for this.  He needs to cut some public service.  Yeah.  Ben, the boys need more wine.  Don't fuck your animals.  There you go.  Damn it.  More wine for the boys.  Oh, there's plenty.  All right.  Raping ostriches is wrong.  Yes.  That is so freaking funny, man.  That is a story and a half. 
[03:07:00]  After I rape the ostrich, nothing will ever be the same.  I'm still scarred from this shit.  What about the ostrich?  Well, yeah.  I didn't think of that perspective.  That takes in counseling right now.  Poor thing.  Very lucky.  I know when it sleeps now, it has its ass in the hole.  It's just fucking looking around, waking up everything.  Head up, ass in hole.  Yeah, maybe I'll keep my head out of the fucking hole.  He's talking to all the other birds.  Fucking ministry.  It's teaching a rape crisis thing. 
[03:07:30]  Can you imagine the teaching?  You know the thing that's going on there?  The good thing is there's in Europe where that kind of shit goes down every day.  Oh, yeah.  It wasn't in the U.S. of fucking A.  They're all filthy animals over there.  If anything, you're going to get sued for plagiarism or something like that.  Tonight, we're doing a benefit concert at the Bronx Zoo.  Free concert ministry.  About one in the morning, and everyone has to drop asses.  What the hell is this shit?  What do you guys...  Hey, Al.  What is this swag?  Hey, Al.  What? 
[03:08:00]  Who?  Huh?  Her?  Her?  What do you guys think of the name Savage Animal for a band name?  That's all right.  I like the name Rising Sun Bandana.  Rising Sun Bandana.  Do you guys watch Supergroup?  Because they're trying to name that band, and they wanted to name it Sebastian Bach.  It's got like Sebastian, Ted Nugent.  What was the name we came up with the other day?  Oh.  Okay.  Coop.  Ostrich fucker.  No, no, no.  Coop.  Coop. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, the Ku Klux Clowns?  We just wore Beetle covers.  Oh, man.  That is brilliant.  That is brilliant.  That is brilliant.  Someone's going to steal that from you, man.  They're going to do it.  Clowns.  We'll come up with a better one.  It's like clan members in the insane clown party.  Yeah.  And what?  You just do, like, what, Beetle covers?  Yeah.  We twist the Beetle covers around a little bit.  Around to make them a little politically incorrect?  Absolutely.  Speaking of the Beatles, Paul McCartney's wife, they're saying she was a prostitute back in 
[03:09:00]  the day.  I know.  I saw that.  Really?  Actually.  Yeah, man.  What do you think?  Kind of thinking about it.  They should have cut her other leg off.  I think it was her with her head in the sand and her ass in the air.  Go around the kitchen on a skateboard with a couple of pounds of sugar.  And the elevator up where she's got to be.  Paul's turning 64 over the weekend, too.  When I'm 64, it's finally here for good old Paul McCartney. 
[03:09:30]  The elevator up to the world.  When I'm 64, I'm going to be divorcing a one-legged hooker.  A one-legged ostrich.  Wasn't there to need him.  Wasn't there to feed him.  Get the fuck out.  You legless bitch.  Do you guys just sit around and think of band names?  Is that one of the things to do on the tour bus?  Yeah, we do that.  There's not a whole hell of a lot else to do.  Huh?  Chick punk band names.  Who's a clown?  Say something.  Go ahead.  Give it.  Give it.  Wait, wait.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Here we are.  Chick punk band.  Yeah. 
[03:10:00]  All right.  Go ahead.  Clitty litter.  Axe wound.  Axe wound.  Clitty litter.  Clitty litter.  Clitty litter.  Protein skimmer.  Protein skimmer.  I should have brought the list.  Oh, exactly.  Now we've got like 700 on the list.  Contagious.  Contagious.  Eventually, we're going to just have like a whole stable full of these old chick punk  bands.  And that's all our label's going to sign is just chick punk bands that we name. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, just keep pumping them out with your name.  Yeah.  Boom.  We're up to about like 20.  I can't remember.  There's like 700.  These names are going to be taken on whack bands.  I'm sorry.  There's 700 on.  We have like 700 on why does a dog lick his balls.  Yeah.  We have 700 on that.  Like 30 on the chick punk band names.  Wow.  We have a lot of time on our fucking hands.  A lot of like uterus jokes in there.  Jeff Boxworthy would make a zillion dollars off the list.  If you're a dog, lick his balls.  We're like completely comedy specific. 
[03:11:00]  Ministry at your cervix.  Only uterus jokes.  I love it.  Al, you never disappoint.  I've got to tell you.  At your cervix.  At your cervix.  I'm delighted to meet you.  And you're calling your tour the Master Bait Tour?  Well, why not?  I got the revolting cocks on there.  Master Bait Tour, 2006.  God damn.  Plus we're just whacking it all across America. 
[03:11:30]  At Pitbull Daycare, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They take care of our dogs.  Well, we're on stage.  The opening act takes care of the dogs.  They're the fluffers.  We brought our dogs.  The Pitbull Daycare guys are the fluffers.  Another bestiality point.  No, we actually, we brought our dogs on tour for the first time.  Well, two of them, and Ozzy and Lemmy are their names.  Very loud.  Lemmy, the loudest dog in the world.  And they've gotten laid more than we have.  Really?  Yeah.  They're like, we've got some movies.  We've got to show you.  Like I said, I'm not into that sort of thing.  Yeah, I hear you. 
[03:12:00]  You can see the spike in peanut butter sales.  Fall on the tour.  You know what I'm saying?  God damn.  Screw the music.  You guys should be doing comedy, man.  Any problems with the dogs?  Is that why you had to get supervision for them?  Yeah, they got an STD.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Someone fucked my dog.  Somehow they got an ostrich STD.  That fucking ostrich, yeah. 
[03:12:30]  Dude, that would be a weird animal.  Dog fucking an ostrich.  Dog strich.  Dog strich.  These guys, they're going to create the next virus.  You know what they're trying to find in the first AIDS patient?  AIDS with the fucking AIDS.  Yeah, we're going to call it H.I. Flying V.  Yeah, H.I. Flying V.  Yeah, that AIDS thing just started in a zoo somewhere in Africa.  A band was traveling.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's going to be a combination of a bird flu and AIDS.  We can take credit for it.  Instead of going to some third world place like Haiti to start some shit, right here, made in the U.S. 
[03:13:00]  So fucking AIDS.  How did this brand new STD?  How did this new strand of Ebola come out?  Well, evidently, somebody from ministry raped an ostrich in a zoo.  And the people can't believe it.  Spread it through its dog.  Believe me.  Believe me.  There was barely, barely any penetration before the ostrich came in.  Well, maybe next time.  Nobody's going to believe it.  Fuck that.  But the government started it, man.  That's some bullshit.  Today, dude.  Did he come?  You're trying to make ministry.  Hey, we got on the bus and we had like a whole bunch of feather dusters like taking the dog and we knew something was going on. 
[03:13:30]  What are you doing?  Did he come?  No.  Nah.  This thing was pissed.  Got pissed immediately.  And they're huge, too, dude, especially when you're tripping.  How did he reach it?  How tall was this guy that he could reach it?  That's what I'm saying.  He was on his tiptoes.  This thing's huge.  I have no idea.  He didn't say a word.  He just jumped the fence and went at it.  He didn't ask, like, you know, give me a leg up.  I want to try something.  No, he didn't give it any French kissing, nothing, no clit tickling. 
[03:14:00]  Nothing?  Trying to put it right in, man.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't even know if it was a dude or a chick, Austin.  I mean, how do you know that shit?  At that point, it doesn't really matter.  You look for an Adam's apple.  I just saw the fact that you've got...  I think you look for an Adam's apple.  It had really big knuckles.  I love how this dude just got instantly aroused.  It's like he saw...  I know.  ...jumped over the fence and his dick is coming up.  He's tripping, though.  He didn't see an ostrich.  No, you can't.  I don't care if you're tripping. 
[03:14:30]  The males are bigger and have a much lovelier plumage.  I could walk past a million ostriches while tripping and definitely not get hard.  That's you.  That hits.  That's everyone.  He's got a bird for plummeting.  Get out, man.  What do I know?  I don't know.  All right.  It was fucked up.  I wouldn't believe he was just next to this guy.  I had to go in there and distract the thing.  And this thing was huge, and it was coming at you, and it was pissed.  I mean, pissed.  I've never seen a more pissed-off creature on this planet.  With every reason to be.  Yeah.  In no fucking way, that guy should have tried to fuck him up.  He's blaming the victim. 
[03:15:00]  What an attitude on that fucking bird.  That fucking thing all pretty and colorful and scared around.  Yeah, exactly.  You put a plume like that in the air?  What do you think's going to happen?  When do we get the live-  Are we allowed to stick around for the live sex act?  Yeah, bring them in.  Bring them in.  I'm not sure what's going on with them.  They brought in this Cleopatra Shea lounge.  If she puts her head on the ground and puts her ass in the air.  She just gave us all bets are off.  The human money box is here.  All bets are off.  The human money box is here.  They hooked us up with a bottle of whack juice. 
[03:15:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, good lube?  Yeah, excellent.  You guys look like you're having fun in here.  Lube is very important.  No fun a lot.  What's my mom doing here?  Give it to your Aussie.  Hey, can you guys put on a couple feather dusters real quick?  Just around the ass.  What's my mother doing here?  We can make it kind of seem like a reenactment.  It's been a while.  That's Sunset Thomas, everyone.  Yes.  God, even her mic's shaped like a cock. 
[03:16:00]  It's hard to talk into a mic shaped like a vagina.  I don't think they make this.  Sure, put one out.  Mine does.  The Sure V-A-G-150.  You've got to do something about the echo.  Sunset Thomas, sunsetslife.com, right?  That's right.  That's the website we're promoting today.  And Rebecca Love is your friend?  Yes, she is.  Hello, Rebecca.  I'm actually also here.  Look at the size of them, man.  I mean, them.  Those. 
[03:16:30]  Those are some boobs.  No, them.  Oh, that is a gift.  You've got some diamonds on there.  I know, Raven.  And outside of maybe.  Bite your finger up and swallow that motherfucker.  Wait for the shit shitting that out in Rikers.  You're talking about the huge diamond ring there.  Yeah.  I love you, baby, but I got to go.  What does that diamond ring mean?  What does it mean?  It was just a gift from a friend.  Just a gift from a friend.  See, you've got to remember, it's on the wrong finger. 
[03:17:00]  It's not a wedding ring.  Yeah, that must have been a hell of a lap dance.  Is it real?  It was a hell of a lap dance.  It must have been a hell of a card dance.  Yeah, man.  I know, 20 bucks, and I'm like, all right.  How many carats is that?  That's huge.  Five.  Five-carat ring.  Yeah.  Wow.  The sun hits that.  It's a laser.  Would your boyfriend rape some chick in Colorado?  I don't have a boyfriend.  The only way I've ever seen a fucking, I'd see a chick in a ring like that.  I don't have a boyfriend.  I'm solo.  Are you? 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, I'm enjoying it.  Nice.  I love it.  Not anymore.  Look at the way Raven's savoring his chops.  He's got that ostrich look.  We've got some Viberstrip here today for you guys, if you want any Viberstrip.  What is that?  We heard all about it.  Yeah.  Wait, Al, you've heard it?  Grab your mic and turn around.  Sold.  Just grab your mic and turn around.  I'm moving.  Where do I sign?  Al, will you tell you what it's about?  Yeah, what does that do?  What is it?  It's a sex enhancer.  Can you put them on your eyes?  Yeah.  I don't read the books.  I'll give you 500 bucks if you put them on your eyes.  I'll be impressed if you put them on your eyes. 
[03:18:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  You have to wait one second.  This is the second best story of the tour.  His roadie puts Listerine strips in his eyes for 50 bucks.  That's got to burn like a motherfucker.  It's the hardest way in the world to make 50 bucks.  I guarantee you.  Wow.  His eyes are like that color.  He's holding up his wine.  He's like burgundy.  Well, fiber stripped up cotton, you can actually put that on your...  You can put it on the nipple. 
[03:18:30]  You can put it on the tip of your butthole.  And you go down on the cock and suck the cock and it actually starts getting it really nice and hot.  Wow.  I know, but it gets too hot.  That's the thing that worries me about these...  No, it doesn't get too hot.  No, these warming gels.  It's like starts getting a little bit cool.  And then all of a sudden it's like, well, when's this going to stop?  Is my cock going to burn up like a fucking candle or what?  Ballpark Frank.  So you freak out.  If you put it on the tip of your butthole...  I'm a Hebrew national.  My dick comes from a higher source.  If you put it on the tip of your asshole, you don't have to worry about it. 
[03:19:00]  It just keeps tangling and you're getting...  Is there a tip of your asshole, by the way?  I'm trying to figure out.  Is there the tip of your dick?  Yeah, I have a little spike.  It's called a polyp.  Yeah, if you force out those duties, that's what I'm...  You stole it from the Ronald Reagan Museum.  I'm going to get my polyps circumcised someday.  Oh, shit.  Now, what do these things do?  Okay, what do you do is you take a piece of it like he's doing it and you put it in your mouth, but you let it melt. 
[03:19:30]  It's got a good flavor to it.  You're chewing it like hubba-bubba.  All of a sudden, after in a couple minutes...  A piece of bazooka gel, he's looking for a comic.  You start getting a sensation.  Oh, in your mouth?  It starts turning you on.  It's actually from empty mouth.  And it's got a little...  It's got a little breath thing as well.  It makes you...  It makes you horny and good.  What happens if you put it in your eye?  Yeah, I love it because it's all natural, too.  You're a fucking eye on it.  If you get really bored, you can just put them in your eye.  Honestly, if I take that, my head would explode.  I don't need that. 
[03:20:00]  Look at you.  I need to chew something after looking at you to get horny?  Yeah.  That's what it is.  Well, maybe you just wanted it like you're out partying or something and just kind of  want to get a little...  And you just want to put some in your eye and eat your side.  It's like the new roofie, you know?  Oh, okay.  LSD strips.  That's what I was talking about.  I need something to chew that's so girls will fuck me.  How does that happen?  You have that kind of...  You've got to have them have their head in this hand.  It's for both.  It's coax.  Yeah.  Can you chew it if you have a beak?  You can chew it. 
[03:20:30]  You suck it.  You know, I'm just curious.  So you suck on it.  I just thought we would suck it, too.  And it kind of gives a tingling, warming.  And if a girl puts this in her mouth and then gives a blowjob, it'll translate to the  guy's...  Do a lap dance while you're talking.  Do a lap dance while you're talking?  Okay.  Did you pop one of those vibran strips yet, baby?  There you go.  You're not supposed to fart when a chick gets on you.  He just farted, dude.  Did you just fart?  That's a typical dance. 
[03:21:00]  He's English.  He's English.  He's English.  It's all right.  That's the way we say hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Notice how fast she got up.  That's the way we show our love.  My jeans are still wet from last night.  It's bird cum.  Holy shit.  You guys are busy, man.  And I hear you guys all over the place.  We're taking over the world, man.  Yeah.  We're blowing up.  You guys rock.  That's it.  We're like the new Hitler.  Hitler light. 
[03:21:30]  Blitzkrieg in our way from station to station.  Hitler light.  Hitler light.  A few less casualties.  Have you heard this fucking show?  You have no idea, Al.  Not quite light.  Low in carbs.  Yeah.  That's it.  All the fun of Hitler without that weight gain.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  My, my.  You know he said something fucked up when you get a porn star going, oh, my.  Oh, my.  She's offended.  What am I doing? 
[03:22:00]  Can I tell you where I'm going to be at in the next couple of days?  Of course you can.  The flamingo.  No, not the flamingo.  Before you do that, you should get on his lap again.  I promise you won't fart.  No, he's going to fart on me.  No, he's going to fart.  I promise.  Yes, he will.  I know he's a one fart guy.  I'm going to fart.

Yeah, but the question is, did you feel it?  Weren't you in Rest Area 6?  I was working for Vivid.  I'm not in Vivid.  Rest Area 6.  The new sex motel.  Rest Area 6.  Only she had short black hair and her name was Bob.  I do remember now.  If anybody asks, I'm at all.  Do your feet at the glory hall.  We'll leave the light on.  That's it.  You get a nice buddy through the glory hall at the rest stop. 
[03:26:00]  That's not great.  One finger comes through.  That wasn't his finger.  Nah.  Nah.  A little short stack.  You banged her at the super rape?  That wasn't his finger.  The super rape.

It'll make you want to fuck a panda bear.  You can fuck them.  Just don't bring them home to your parents.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Ling Ling.  What the fuck is this?

Who hasn't watched fucking?  Yeah, you get them a vibe.  They're real asses.  They're good to go.  You got to fuck mules because they can't get you pregnant.  Have you been?  She looks like she'd ride an owl.  I don't know why.  Owl.  Right away.  That'd be cute.  Ride a what?  She's got the little owl face.  Owl?  Yeah, like an owl.  Sex with owls?  Yeah.

Hey, you fucking winked at me.  I'll make your head spin.  You want to know what's happening?  It was hitting on me, I swear.  Of course.  The guy that had the fucking ostrich is yelling at you.  How do you do doggie style with an owl?  You must explain.  You just put them over there, and then you turn their fucking head around.  You don't have to worry about them fighting back like those big pain-in-the-ass ostriches. 
[03:29:30]  That's right.  What happens if the zygotes mix, and you have a little owl human being?  That ain't ever happening.  You are so fucked.  I'll send the payment.  Knock, knock, knock on the door.  You know what?  The best thing.  Who?  Who's your dad?  Yeah, the best thing about a fucking owl, you can fuck them in the ass while they're  looking at you.  With one eye.  The ever-staring eye.  Dude, you have serious issues. 
[03:30:00]  You need therapy.  You've been thinking about how to fucking ass fucking owl.  You fucking did it.  You didn't do it.  The keyboard came out.  I didn't do it.  You watched it.  I was the distraction from the pissed-off ostrich.  I didn't fuck it.  No, now he's the hero.  You're fantasizing.  You stood by while the ostrich got fucking raped and you did nothing about it.  And you helped the rapist get away.  I know.  That's what the fuck you did.  I'm an accomplice.  I gotta admit.  But.  Wow.  The owl thing, I can't even wrap my mind. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, do they even have feet for doggy style?  Do they even have a pussy?  Don't you need knees to get a girl into doggy style?  Do they even have fucking-  You ain't ever seen my feet?  He's talking about doggy style on an owl.  No, the reason, I said, what I said was she looks like she'd ride an owl.  Yeah.  There was something about her face.  It just, I don't know.  It just reminded me of that.  What do you guys think?  Would you fucking owl?  God damn.  Who would have thought it came back on me?  You would fucking owl?  No.  Not even if it clipped me an owl.  What's why?  Couldn't get you pregnant?  Supposedly.  There's some, like, there's some severe honesty going on here right now.

Man, you gotta quit squirting or farting or whatever.  Well, I like it when they squirt now.

It's a little bullet that you put on your tongue and you stick it to your tongue  and it vibrates.  Oh, that'd be great when EMS is trying to pry it out of your throat.  You can mix your cocktail.  You can mix your cocktails.  Anthony, that's awesome.  Man, put it in your eye.  I did a Robin recommend on that.  Put it in your eye.  That thing, you need that right there.

Yeah.  That's pretty famous as a sex toy.  It has kind of a rotating ball bearing thing at the top, and then it's got something that...  Yeah.  It's like the rabbit.  Oh, no.  It's like the rabbit.  The top of the penis part swivels, and then the other thing, either that is a warp drive  or it does the clit.  And then it's got a remote control for speed.  It's like a drunken Nazi. 
[03:36:00]  And turn it up!  It's like a drunken Nazi.  Have you seen that movie Anaconda?  I'm going to go out on a limb here.  Hey, there's enough drunken Nazis in here already.

She's putting the Viber strip in her mouth.  She's sucking on it.  I'm into people now.  People power.  What kind of sensation are you getting there?  It's like a mystery in town.  It's a little, but you're tingly.  It takes away bad breath.  I'll pay that.  You're like hot as a firecracker. 
[03:37:00]  God damn it.  You don't want bad breath when you're going to be sticking your mouth on a pussy.  I was just being profound there for a minute.  That was very poetic.  All right.  Now, Lube.  We need Lube immediately.  I have some.  You got the...  We're not talking out of your tap.  Lotion boy.  Lotion boy.  Her panties are coming off.  That's very nice.

We got a little bit of snatch going on over there.  That's very nice.  Good morning.  They're on the little couch we got in here.  A little tapping going on.  I'm not tapping.  Why don't you put a Viber strip on my clit?  Hey, how about that?  Put a Viber strip on her clit.  Put it in your eye.  Put it in your mouth.  Put it in her eye.  I still want to see it in the eye.  Put it around the brown eye.  No, get it right in.  It's like the tapping.

I actually went into that thinking it was a horse-fucking movie.  I was very disappointed.  I can't quit clit.  All right.  Well, now she's lubing it herself.  Look at that.  A little action going on there.  She's waving.  Yeah, I don't think I've seen enough unpleasantness for one day. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, damn it.  What would you rather have a couple of fucking ostriches in here?  Raven, what are you doing?  We got some pussy licking going on there.  You didn't even have to do anything.  And then there's...  No, but her.  What do you think this is, Avenue Q?  At least put a pinky up her butt or something.  Don't put a pinky up her butt.  I can't.  Is that like a baby mouse?  Look, that...  Look, pretend she was an ostrich.  Her ass is in the air.  You're walking by.  You're tripping.  Think about it.  I love you, man.

I need it for me.  Oh, she's jacking the mechanical cock and lubeing it all up.  And then we'll turn it on and see how this thing works.  Did you put some of the strip on her clint?  Yeah, I did.  I licked her pussy.  No, wait.  Is that thing on the part that spins around like a drunken Nazi?  I'm like a drunken Nazi. 
[03:39:30]  I think she would do with her first.  I'm so fucking wet right now.  Are you?  No.  No, of course not.  Did you just say Ein Speich Slice?  I was like Ein Speich Slice.  I was doing the old pewter...  The big pewter Bierstein song that they do during October.  Your head's in the way.  You know what creeps me out is your cameraman.  He never shows any emotion.  And he's a total voyeur, man.  He's a pervert.  He's like a bicycle seat sniffer.  He's like the Zabruder of pussy.

Stick the other part up her ass.  Get some few tips for her ears.  She's got a desk lamp.  I want something up her nose.  She doesn't have a hole in her abdomen.  Put it in her ass.  Spin it around.  It's a crash test.  What the hell is the floss machine for?  Oh, I got it.  The floss machine?  What is that thing?  That's a magic wand.  All right.  That's so it can reach those hard to get out.  Put the other part up her ass.  That's supposed to be... 
[03:41:00]  Oh, she's got a little Hitler mustache.  Right now, I don't know what's working.  It looks like a cubit.  It looks like they're digging for a tumor.  A Hitler mustache.  I wish my masseuse would do something like this.  What the hell's your masseuse?  You're actually getting hot.  That's awesome.  She's got tight pussy, man.  Uh-oh.

There's too many people laughing.  I love it.  Fuck it, I can't even fake it.  That's honesty.  I like that.  That's honest.  You can't.  There's too many people around. 
[03:42:30]  People from a porn star can't even cum.  You're absolutely right.  That's why you're a star.  Steve, get out.  Hey, your cameraman's creepy, dude.  We know.

I don't want to see what that looks like.  She don't want to see my tip of my ass.  I want to see the tip of her ass.  She's not doing it.  Hey, tip of my ass has like a polyp problem.

Put down the wine, pick up the cock.  Give the girls a lesson.  I use my hand as an extension of my mouth.  Uh-huh.  So, when I go down, I'm not going to talk. 
[03:44:00]  I'll just show you.  Okay.  She's awesome.  I'm not going to do it.  And I do a twist to the arm.  Oh, it's a radial twist.  Mm-hmm.  It's like a child-proof cat.  And some guys like you to squeeze hard, and some guys want it soft.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  But then you go down to get more wetness on it.  Right.  We want it.  Like, really hard.  And you swallow to deep throat it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You swallow it like food, and you get further down.  It is food.  I do.  Swallow it like food.  It's like a fucking ballpark.  What do you mean?  I don't understand.  That's awesome.  Just kind of demonstrate.  That's great.  Quarter of the day.  The rubbery stuff tastes nasty. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, it tastes a little nasty.  But then you're using your hand.  There's a wine bottle.  Wait, wait, wait.  Here, here, here.  Forget the rubbery stuff.  We got an English guy here.  It's almost rubbery.  It's okay.  It's almost a penis.  But at the same time, I'm, like, grabbing the balls, and I'm holding it.  Grab the balls.  He's got teeth.  Maybe that's why you came in second.  And then as you go down on the cock, you do the shrugs.  Where are you from?  Upstate New York.  Oh, now we're getting a demonstration.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[03:45:00]  But the best way to give a blowjob is have the guy go over you 69 so you can toss the salad,  lick the balls, and boobie at the same time so you're, like, multitasking.  Wow.  All right.  I like how she brings the high-tech world of business terminology into sucking cock.  That was nice.  No problem.  That was nice.  And that came in, Jesus Christ.  That came in second?  What came in first?  A corporate takeover.  A corporate takeover.  You know what they judge on the movie?  The woman had a vagina on her chin. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, the little man got shagged.  With their mainstream dick sucking.  They call her old pussy chin.  I want to know how you would fuck an owl or suck an owl off after you had your little fantasy.  Bill Burr's six.  Now, see you reach around the owl.  I don't even know if they have a dick or piss.  Next time you have a gig in Portland, someone on your bus is going to do it.  There'll be some spotted fucking owl up there.  No, you're up.  I'm up.  There's laws against that here.  Yeah, you always keep it in another country.
