<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a bizarre phone call from Dan in Minneapolis, followed by a discussion of their infamous “55-gallon drum challenge,” involving placing women in drums and introducing various creatures and substances, resulting in at least one hospital visit due to a cricket in a woman's ear.  Listeners could find archived audio of this and other past shows on OAVirus.com.  The hosts then played clips from a recent interview with Jose Canseco, discussing steroid use, which they jokingly endorsed.

Next, comedian Keith Robinson joined the show, but the bulk of this segment focused on a heated conversation with comedian Colin Quinn.  Quinn recounted a car ride argument with Jim Norton about appearances and Norton’s post-special club routine.  He also detailed his struggles with a massive, disorganized writing project and expressed bitterness towards his divorce and the entertainment industry.  The hosts, along with a later call-in from Bob Kelly, engaged in a back-and-forth exchange of insults and jokes with Quinn, featuring frequent interruptions and side conversations. The show concluded this segment with a news update about a Six Flags accident where a woman lost her feet on a ride.

The next segment featured Tracy Morgan as a guest following a celebrity softball game.  The discussion quickly devolved into a vulgar and sexually explicit conversation about pornography, sex, and racial stereotypes related to sexual practices.  Specific topics included Morgan's pornography preferences, R. Kelly's alleged sexual misconduct, using pornography as sex education, and detailed descriptions of sexual acts.  Several callers contributed to the explicit and offensive nature of the conversation.  Later, D.L. Hughley joined the show.  The conversation then shifted to discussions about boycotts and criticism for controversial commentary, as well as Mike Tyson, Robin Givens, and STDs.  The overall tone remained highly irreverent and crude, with frequent use of offensive language and graphic sexual descriptions.

The final segment focused on a discussion about freedom of speech in stand-up comedy.  An unnamed comedian (likely one of the many mentioned throughout the broadcast) defended the use of offensive language and controversial jokes, arguing that audience reaction, not external pressure, should determine boundaries.  He used racial slurs and the word "ho" repeatedly, citing examples of other comedians facing backlash (Jay Leno, John Rocker) and highlighting the double standard black comedians face compared to white comedians.  He contrasted superficial symbolic gestures with tackling substantive issues like illiteracy and violence.  The hosts supported the comedian's perspective.  The discussion then shifted to the comedian's upcoming appearances and the constraints of corporate sponsors, contrasting the freedom of subscription radio with restrictions on regular FM airtime.  A humorous subplot involved D.L. Hughley's early departure from the studio, with various explanations and a potential self-organized protest of his own exit.  Several other comedians were mentioned: Rich Vos, Bill Burr, Louis C.K., Robert Kelly, and Colin Quinn.

[00:00:00]  Now presenting comedian  Keith Robinson  It's the best of the worst  Of the comics  On the Opie and Anthony show  Dan in Minneapolis  What's up Dan?  Hey I just wanted to say  You guys are doing a hell of a job  Thanks  I have no idea what he's saying 
[00:00:30]  Because he's not really playing along here  And he's still talking  And we're trying to help him out  This isn't Marvin Luther is it?

[00:01:00]  Melvin Leon King  It's a holiday  First Monday in February  You flip a bus and kill someone  Dan I don't know what you said  So  I think you like the program though  He likes the show  Thanks Dan  Alright well  That was a waste of time  And then we got this idiot  We always had these idiots  Guinness what's up?  Hey ONA what's going on?  Hey man  Hey little Jimmy  Hi Guinness  Hey I want to know when you guys are going to get some women up there  Have a good little contest  Like a wiffle ball bat  55 gallon drum challenge 
[00:01:30]  Ooh remember that one?  Oh I used to love it man  I remember you guys back in Boston  That stinks though  The 55 gallon drum  Yeah  Remember how bad the studio smelled?  We actually had to take Vicks  And put it under our nose  Like there were dead bodies in the studio  Yeah that was awful  The smell was horrendous  And then we almost got in trouble  Because a girl  A cricket  Went in a girl's ear  And what we did  We used to take about  Five or eight  55 gallon drums  It started out as the  Serial killer challenge  Yeah  By the way  And then it turned into  The 55 gallon drum challenge 
[00:02:00]  Then you had the girls  Running across the street  To the hotel  Which looked like a crime scene  Well  We would take girls  Put them in 55 gallon drums  Seal the top up  They'd be in bikinis  Or no their underwear  It was their underwear  And then we would just take  The most heinous stuff  And throw it into these barrels  Living insects  Living eels  Snakes  Food products made out of  Just bellies of cows  Intestines  Lungs  We invented hissing cockroaches  The big hissing  Madagascar  We were the first ones  To use the hissing cockroaches 
[00:02:30]  And they hissed  They became a staple  On Fear Factor  But we found  We found the hissing cockroaches  A long time ago  Hissing cockroaches  A bag of crickets  Oh yeah  Well that's what got us in  Trouble  That's what got us in trouble  With that god damn  You know what we should do  Maybe tomorrow  If it's not too hard  Get some of the reactions  When we're dumping stuff  Into the 55 gallon drum  Yeah the screams  That would come out  If it's too much work  Forget it  But the screams  That would come from these barrels  Remember the big eels  Yep  That were flopping  And hitting the barrel  And we're trying to get them  Into the barrels  And they're just losing 
[00:03:00]  Their minds or whatever  Girls  Screaming in horror  You get a girl  Screaming in horror  With that muffled  Echo-y sound of a barrel  Then the pig blood  It's fantastic  It's fantastic  The pig's blood  Yeah we'd pour pig's blood  In on these girls  And then we poured the crickets in  One cricket crawled in a girl's ear  And wouldn't come out  She couldn't get it out  So she had to go to the hospital  To get it taken out  Meanwhile we take her out of the barrel  She's covered in pig blood  And in her underwear  Now the emergency guys  Come upstairs  Put her on a stretcher  To take her down 
[00:03:30]  Because I guess that's  Just standard procedure  They're trying to get the cricket  Out of her ear  Couldn't  So they decide  They're going to take her  Down to the hospital  They didn't know  What was going on  They were ready  To call the cops  Well  They bring her through  The lobby of the building  And here's this girl  Head to toe  Covered in blood  In her underwear  Coming out of our studio  Hi  The Opian Anthony show  Enjoy  That really did not  Bode well with the  Security of the building  She must have smelled  Too awful  Stuff on her  Awful  It was a great bit  Like she got kicked in the guts  With a stomach full of McDonald's

[00:07:30]  Story too negatively  Yeah he's being  He's being called  On the carpet  Because he's kind of  Saying steroids  Are good in some cases  And the kids might  Make it the wrong idea  Well I think they're great  I do too  After seeing Mark  McGuire's wife  I have a whole new  Appreciation for the  Steroids thing  So if you're listening  Kids feel free  Steroids are okay  Mommy and daddy  Are wrong  Take them as soon  As you can  Steroids endorsed  By the Opey and  Anthony show  Right  We should pump

[00:08:30]  Or something  Start listening  Around 7  Oh wait  We have to do  The other thing  Oh we can't do that  Because then it's like  Time zone all over the place  Ah whatever  You'll figure it out  50 minutes in  50 minutes in  You can start listening  It gets better  Keith Robinson killed  Oh man  He's still here  But we can promote  That Keith Robinson  Killed on the show today  Yep  I had a good time  There you go  I'm here man  It was great  A lot of fun man  It's Black History Month  It's one of my funniest  Black History Month  That's why you're here  You think you're coming back  Next month  No I won't be  See you guys next February 
[00:09:00]  Patrice next week  And then March  It's done  One month a year  We humor you guys  The other 11 are for Whitey  Whitey  Well I don't know  Should we try to get into these clips  We've only got a couple minutes  I just want to  I don't know  I guess  Which one do you want to hear?  The one on benefits of steroids  Benefits of steroids  What track number?  That'll help Derek  Is it 15?  There's so many numbers on this  15? 
[00:09:30]  Alright let's listen to this  It's quick  When you're injured  You can recuperate a lot faster  From steroid use  And it's a great confidence booster  You're actually stronger  Where a season is 162 games  Then you've got spring training  Playoffs and World Series  You talk about well over 200 games  So one of the major factors  Is fatigue and muscle wear and tear  And steroids done properly  Couldn't cut that down in half  Hey  He's doing a commercial for steroids  Telling the truth  That is great  Let's go to track 16  Because this is what I was wondering 
[00:10:00]  Why he would name names  It makes the book more viable  More interesting  It makes it real  I named myself also in there  It's a true story of my life  And everyone that was involved in it  And I think that  You know the public  The fans  They want to know who was involved  Hey Anthony  We can have the exclusive interview  With Jose Canseco  Oh you want to do it the way  That they actually use these clips  There are radio guys  Mancow is very guilty of this  Really?  These are the type of things  Like they do the basic interview  And then these hack jocks 
[00:10:30]  From all over the country  Will get the sound bites  And then make believe  They interviewed them  They cut themselves in  They cut themselves in  So you would ask the question  And then Jose Canseco  Gives the answer  And it sounds like  You're doing the exclusive  Now Jose  People are  This is track 19  You better tell them  What track it is  You ask a question  He's just  Jose people are  Viewing your story  A little too negatively  What do you have to say  About that?  These players do not  Try to hurt the game  They do not try to hurt  Any individuals  If anything 
[00:11:00]  Worst case scenario  If they're doing  These steroids improperly  They're hurting themselves  But they're not  Hurting anyone else  They're just trying to  Set up their families  Financially as much as possible  They're trying to create  More longevity  Longevity in the game  For them  They're trying to become  More of a well-known athlete  They're trying to help  Their team win  By becoming a better athlete  So I think people  Are just looking at this  Too negatively  Oh  Well that didn't work  Can I try one?  Yeah you try one  Alright track 13 
[00:11:30]  Want to cue that one up?  Okay  Jose  Aren't you afraid  By naming names  In this book  That people are going to  Come out and maybe sue you?  Truly believe  These individuals  Do try to sue me  I think they're going to  Be making a monstrous  Mistake  Because the truth  Will definitely  Definitely come out  Then  They don't want to  Push me to the wall  Uh-huh  Jose  A lot of this stuff  Goes behind closed doors  Right?  Major League Baseball  Itself  Isn't really going to 
[00:12:00]  Do anything  And the player association  Isn't really going to  Do anything  Until congress  Comes and steps in  Congress will have to  Do a major investigation  And put a stop to that  And the ones responsible  Everybody wants to  Blame the player  Hold on  You'll hold me out  To drive you  To drive you bastard  It's track 14  Let me try this again  You son of a bitch  Are you about to  Track 14  That was the congress thing  Track 14 is what  Lady Di's husband  Was standing on  Nice call back 
[00:12:30]  Jose  We're hearing a lot  Of this stuff  Goes on behind  Closed doors  It's part of the game  These are things  That are kept in house  Never really spoken about  Outside the clubhouse  I mean  How many things  Go on back there  Believe me  Fans and managers  Sometimes  They have no idea  Hey  Can I ask a question  For track  Oh no  Track 8  Okay  Hey  Jose  A lot of people  Say that you're  A dirty Puerto Rican  Why don't you talk 
[00:13:00]  About Sosa and Mac  Everybody wants to  Blame the players  And this and that  You know what  The owners need  They all turned  Their heads to it  They didn't care  As long as  They were making money  Player Association knew  Don Fear  And all these guys  They all knew  What was going on  They just turned  A blind eye to it  And said hey  You know  The game's developing  Again  It's growing  You know  The Sammy Sosa  Mark McGuire show  They were both  Juiced  No if and what's  About it  Oh 4  Track 4  Jose  When you're  Slugging your wife 
[00:13:30]  In the face  Because of steroid use  Is there another way  To go about  Using the steroids  So you don't do that  There is a right way  And there is a wrong way  To do steroids  If you're going to do steroids  Please seek professional help  Obviously this stuff is illegal  You have to get prescriptions for it  You have to get medical supervision  You have to have the right doctors  You have to have the right blood testing  Do not go behind closed doors  With your friends  And use dirty needles  And start injecting your cells  And start guessing at what dosage 
[00:14:00]  Your body should use  That's what I thought  That's when you get into big trouble  Yeah  I think the steroid issue  Has been  Been what?  So misunderstood  And locked behind  One more thing  Program complete  It's the best  Of the worst  Of the comics  On the Opie and Anthony show  Opie and Anthony  Welcome back  To the Opie and Anthony radio program  It's the best  The best  Of the worst  Of the comics  On the Opie and Anthony show 
[00:14:30]  Hey it's Opie and Anthony  And this is the worst  Of Colin Quinn  On the Opie and Anthony show  All three appearances  How often has the guy been on?  Yeah you need a guy  To come on a regular basis  To have a worst of segment  On the Opie and Anthony show  I think this is every single time  He's been on  Right  He's been on like three times  Yeah  Hey E-Rock  This was just a wonderful idea  Great idea E-Rock  Just another brilliant idea  By E-Rock  We'll see you guys soon  We're on vacation  And as we were talking  Colin just was saying 
[00:15:00]  Why don't you bring on  Your accountant  And he was dismissing me  By not looking at me  With his fucking awful  Middle finger pointed at me  Yeah  Which I thought was  Definitely disrespectful  Well here's the thing about Jim  As you guys know  I spoke to you guys briefly  At the Pat Cooper roast  And I said I really discussed  It with Jim  And as you know  I'm only half joking  When I say things like that  Yeah  And I mentioned that  Here's what bothers me  At Jim  What?  Okay I've mentioned  This to him before  Okay  We're in a car one day  And I was probably  Zinging him  He drives me uptown  In this crummy car  Non-celebrity car  The fancy caddy 
[00:15:30]  What are you talking about?  It's a caddy  That looks like  It's a Camry  Obviously you haven't  Taken a ride with Jimmy  In a while  Camry caddy  It's a Camry caddy  It looks like a Camry  It feels like a Camry  And nobody knows  It's a caddy  Unless you say it  The caddy actually  Took the insignia off  So he really caught  Me and his girl  And you know  And so maybe  I was zinging him  A little hard  You forget sometimes  Because we're comedians  And we bust balls  But when you call Jimmy  Like I kept calling  What an ugly creep  And how he's  Worked out to look mediocre  And I forget that  Like even though  We're comedians  We bust balls  Probably his childhood 
[00:16:00]  Had a lot of pain  And horror  As it should have  So suddenly  Here we are  Me being a snide  Kind of idiot  His girlfriend  Sitting there  Probably politely  Putting up with it  And then Jim  Outbursts  Goes  So what about you  You act like you were  A 10  When you were younger  You weren't that great looking  Just with total anger  Like you're holding in  This nonsense  And I was like  First of all  I never thought I was a 10  I was about a  I was a hard 7  He goes  You were a fucking 6  No  You will not make 
[00:16:30]  A monologue out of this  No  He's lying  He's lying  Can I finish my statement  This is my opening statement  It's a 40 minute dissertation  That's not true  It's a falsehood  You're spreading falsehood  No it's not  I wasn't angry  Here's what Colin does  He was an angry  That person  Believe me  I wasn't mad  Me and my girlfriend  Still laugh at that  She's like  What did Colin say  He was that day  I'm like a hard 7  But he acts like  Colin acts like  He's fucking 10 pounds away  From the glory days  Like he was fucking  Oh no I don't  Well alright  140  He acts like  He was beautiful  And he was not 
[00:17:00]  A bad looking guy  That's all I said  I never thought  You act like  You were gorgeous  But that's what I'm saying  The fact that he thinks that  But no it's true  First of all  Even if it had been true  Which I know how  I really thought  But even if I did think that  Why wouldn't you let an old man  Have his old delusion  Because you're not that much  Older than me  He screamed  I didn't scream at you  The amount of anger there  And here's my other point  Okay  Here's my other point  What other point  You haven't made one to begin with  Alright here's my first  And only point  And he is a lot older than you  He's 10 years older than me  I'm 48  I'm 39  You're 9 years older than me 
[00:17:30]  But in entertainment years  Colin is a hell of a lot older than you  Yeah  But here's what bothers me  The fact that he's angry about that  That was true  That was pretty funny  I thought  Well I thought it was  I didn't think it was an insult  But apparently it was  Go ahead  I don't like the fact that Jim  Right after his last special  Goes to the club every night  Because it's almost like  Hey man I'm a gym rat  I just work at stand up  You're a compulsive ass  Oh  Take a few weeks off  Shut up and let me finish  No  I'll tell you why 
[00:18:00]  I'm not a gym rat  You think to yourself  Hey I'm a guy that just  Blue collar  I take my lunch pail  Into the club every night  With your fake humility  And I'm putting a stop to it today  Why?  I don't want people  Shut your face  Hold on  No no no  You're compulsive  Take a few weeks off  And just breathe  I'm compulsive  You ever seen yourself  In front of a buffet?  Oh that was hurtful  Of course it was  But if that's true  The reason I do it  Is because  I don't think a buffet  I know  I couldn't think of a better way  To say it  But the bottom line is  I don't want people coming out  After seeing the HBO special  And seeing the same shit 
[00:18:30]  They're gonna get pissed off  It's selfish  I want to make more money  I think what Colin's trying to say though  You don't seem to enjoy  All the success at times  But I do enjoy the success  I love doing stand up  Is that a chore?  I'm trying to stop  Any enjoyment of the success  Oh you don't want him to enjoy it  If he has any chance  Of enjoying it  I'm putting a stop to it now  Oh look  Another chewed pen  I think the fucking  I'm gonna keep chewing the pens  Who's chewing the pen?  I don't know  Whoever it is  Is gonna get  What are you doing?  He's putting it up his hands  There you go  Whoever chews pens  Enjoy  Enjoy the chewed pen  Fucking cunt  Damn it 
[00:19:00]  And chew on that  Shit  Ew  Now wait a minute  Yes that's shit  All right  You have to be careful  With that kind of behavior  No I don't like  I want to do new stuff  So I was done  With the set in June  And I started doing new stuff  I don't want you to do  The same material  People come out and see me  They're fucking not gonna  See the same act  You know what he's a little  I'm picking up something here  I don't want to completely bash Jimmy  I'm picking up something  I think Jimmy is assuming  That everyone has seen the HBO special 
[00:19:30]  Yeah you're right  So that he's gotta get new material  Because when they go out  Everyone that's there has seen his old material  No one has seen it  But it's more than that  Not everyone no  But I do think that a good amount of people will come  Who have seen it  Hold on  We're trying to change the subject  Can I address my friend  I think there's truth in both  No I don't assume  Everyone has seen it  Believe me  I would love to be able to just live off that  For another year  But you can't  That's not what I'm saying  What  What I'm saying is that  You think  You fancy yourself 
[00:20:00]  A humble gym rat  That goes down to the club  And just works it out  And I want you to stop coming to the club  And if I see you there again  I'm gonna punch you in the snout  Well you're never there  What are you talking about  You fucking lonely psychopath  If I decide to go there  You know you're writing a manifesto  Like fucking Ted Kaczynski  You're never there  He's just in front of his computer  Railing about technology  And Jews  And fucking lesbians  That run show business  What are you talking about  How do you know where I am  He's starting to leave the house again  He's fucking  That's right  I'm here aren't I  You're an agoraphobic creep 
[00:20:30]  You had to  Because Mazzilli threatened to fire you  If you didn't fucking plug  Probably had eight tickets sold  It's like go on the radio  No one knows you're in our club  Oh shit  But that's why he's here to plug  It's fine  The hurt that is going on over here  There's no hurt at all  That's where you have to go out and plug  When you're doing a gig  Do you believe this idiot's trying to act like  Mr. Pragmatic  Shut your mouth right now  But it's the truth  It's reality  I am a very pragmatic  Which I think means realistic  Guy  I'm not exactly sure what pragmatic means  Colin what's going on with you  Hopefully it means fun and joyful 
[00:21:00]  What's going on with Colin  Well actually what Jimmy's saying is semi-correct  In that I have been writing my manifestos  But they're not really against anything particular  It's just basically it's a compilation  You know I have like  What happened was I got ahead of myself  Psychologically  And wrote thousands and thousands of pages  So my apartment looks a little bit like Kaczynski  A height  A little bit like Beautiful Mind  Yeah  Just notes stuck to the walls with strings  Connecting bits together  Yeah  And that's the problem  So I've been trying to organize it 
[00:21:30]  But it's very difficult  I wish I had like a  You know I fantasize about having like  A really efficient Asian like assistant  You know  Yes in stockings  And of course the other part of it  Yes in mail  You know  But I'm just  That's what I've been just going on with me  You know  Why don't you get yourself a trapper keeper  I used to use those to organize  When I was a trapper  Or the five section dump book  But I got like so many  You know what I mean  I've been like thousands  It is like  It's gone  It's gone a little out of my control  And what is this thing gonna be  A book someday  Well it's like ten books  It's just so many things 
[00:22:00]  It's too many pages of things  Wow  Are you being serious for once  Yes yes  Yes  So weird  You just sit there  And you're typing away  No his I don't like  Is I just go to OB  Like I was like  So you got all the stuff  Like yeah you're really trying to  Like I was like  Yeah OB understands  Like I got him  And he goes  You being serious  It was weird  It's weird  It's weird when you get serious Colin  Oh  I thought you meant  It was weird  That I have all my thousands of pages  You're very protective  Yes you are  We only see one side of you  The sarcastic side  We don't get to see the real sweet Colin  We don't get to see the sweet Colin 
[00:22:30]  You have a big fat shell around you  Looks like  I picture you crying alone  In your apartment some nights  No not really crying you know  There's a lot more anger than me  Chewing the inside of his mouth  Like a coke addict  Right  Yeah there's a lot more you know  We're just trying to see other sides of you today  I can't imagine myself  Yeah  This is kind of an intervention  You didn't realize what you stepped into today  Well I'm just trying to say  Like I'm not really  I don't see myself as hurting myself  Before really damaging a lot of people 
[00:23:00]  A lot of other people  Sure  My own analysis of it you know  Really you don't like  When I was in your 30th floor apartment  And he steps over the rail  And he's kind of hanging on  And letting go for a second  Did you know it?  Yes he was  That's cool  Yes he was  36 floor  And doing like the  Oh  Yes  Where you let go  Fall backwards  And then grab the rail  Alright Colin  That's a problem  No I've always been like that  That's a bit of a problem  No I used to do that  That's cool  I'd lean out the window  And hang on  From what?  The fucking  On the set?  The 17th floor  No the office  On the 17th floor  Why would you do that?  Wait wait wait  Could you slow down a minute? 
[00:23:30]  Who's apartment was this?  His  So you have an outdoor space?  It's a balcony  Balcony  And he was on the outside of the rail?  Yes he stepped outside the rail  And he's like letting go for it  Not going back that far  That's hilarious  What were you hoping for?  A really good reaction from your friends?  You know what I was hoping for?  Butterfingers  He was hoping  He was hoping a stray pigeon  Would come by and jar me  And snip in his eye  You were hoping for an ounce of care  From Jim Norton  The last thing you see  Is a smiling Jim Norton  Looking over the railing  That's how Colin gets love 
[00:24:00]  He can't just say  I need some love  He has to hang on to a rail  So we'll all go  No don't  Like he wants us to  He wants the value  Of having everyone appreciate  Come out  He's turning  My great beginning analysis  This ass is taking  What was your beginning analysis?  About you  And suddenly it's turn around about me  So what?  That's the way life is  Turn about is fair play  I always say  And you would hang out  That's a tough talk  You would hang out the window?  Yeah but that's  That was easy  I don't remember that  That's such a small part of the manifesto  I can't even believe we're discussing it  That's nothing to me 
[00:24:30]  But you could have  You do understand  You could have  Nah  Fallen  Nah  To your death  Yes  But anything can happen  But that didn't bother you or  How far did he lean back  Before he grabbed hold again?  Doesn't matter  Just stepping  But that doesn't matter  Just the act of doing it  Dude I would be freaked out  Stepping on the other side of the rail  Holding on tight  But some people are also  Very scared of heights  Like Bobby Kelly's been over  My house a couple times  And he goes on the balcony  Dude don't push me  You know it's like  No he's afraid the balcony  Is going to fucking just crack 
[00:25:00]  Under his weight  As he should be  You better run back  In a steamroller  Under your fucking balcony  And let Bob step onto it  Yeah  He's scared that he's going to  Go right through that railing  With a slight push  He's scared  And the balcony is also scared  They look at each other  With a mutual understanding  Just look over me from inside  I'll do what I can for you kid  But  Bob's stepping on that balcony  It would be like an elephant  Stepping onto a piece of tracing paper  Sure  Poor Bob  Not here to defend  Not here to defend himself 
[00:25:30]  Fuck poor Bob  With a black cock  Right in his mouth  That's what I say to Bob  Fucking juicy lips  Fucking grab his head  And fuck his throat  You got Colin laughing  Or is he crying  Who knows  Are you crying  Laughing  What do you got over there Colin  Just an elephant  Of tracing paper  Yeah  It's very good  I don't think it'll hold  Tracing paper  So you're going to be  At Gotham Colin  Yeah  But what about the manifesto 
[00:26:00]  I need an organized assistant  What are you trying to do  Yeah what is it  I don't know  Is it like a huge book  Is it a book about your life  It's everything  It's everything  Then start writing a blog  Are you a blogger  No  I blogged for a couple days  It was boring  Well then why don't you  Fucking stop being  Such an isolated homo  And fucking get someone  To help you  Straight it out  And sell it  Yeah why the isolation  I don't know  Uh oh  We are getting the serious Colin  Yeah he's back away  From the mic  Colin's depressed I think  That's my theory  Are you depressed  My theory is  He hasn't told me that  But I theorize  He's a little depressed 
[00:26:30]  Sell some drugs  What  The Suffolk County solution  Laughing  And that's all my friend  I know but where you from  Aren't you from  Yeah I'm from Suffolk  Where you from  Aren't you from  Huntington  No not Ron Conkoma  He's changing the subject  To where you're from  That's never good  I'll go right back to it  Go ahead  Are you depressed  Why are you depressed  No I'm actually  Coming out of depression  But I was depressed  You seem  How are you  You seem  Way better than the last time  I saw you  Thank you exactly  I'm dead serious  I'm being serious now  I'm agreeing with you 
[00:27:00]  I said thank you  You had like a  Jesus Christ  You had a distant look  In your eyes for a while there  Yes  I don't see that today  Thousand yard stare  Absolutely  I don't see that today  Were you  That's right  Did you name your  Fucking computer  Charlene  About anything  Full metal jacket  Anything in particular  Or just one of those  Chemical imbalance  Depressions  No I think I was just  Depressed in general  A lot of stuff  I don't know  I don't think it was chemical  You find yourself  Sleeping late  Not getting out of bed  I always sleep late  How did you get out of the depression 
[00:27:30]  Just kind of  Just facing it  I've been going to therapy  For many years anyway  Working out and stuff  No obviously not  How could you ask that  Why don't you ask him  If he's fucking  Painting his face black  Jesus Ope  He's obviously not  I'll say something else  Jesus  I'm going to say something else  Looks like he did lose  A few pounds  That's why I asked that  Thanks Ope  Did you?  What do you think of that?  I'm not going to  Badmouth you  I said just to do that  Three years of working out  And no definition  Whatsoever 
[00:28:00]  But I understand  Shut up  By the way  No definition  I said a few  I said a few  Not a lot by the way  Yeah  You want to feel the guns?  I can look right here  And I'm telling you  I agree actually  I have been kind of  Swinging in the wind there  Fucking working out  Hoping for a little definition  But I can't stop eating  It's very difficult  It's your eating habits  I know it is  It's not the food  No  So  So what  You just started  Living your life again?  No I still haven't  Started to live my life  But I've been depressed  But I've just been  Working on certain things  But you know 
[00:28:30]  It's a lot of stuff  You know  I mean I hate to even  Talk about it  Because it really is  About the manifesto  I hate to say it  But it really is  Yeah  You know  And so that's been  A big part of it  Is the manifesto  Is it your life?  Is it some fiction?  Is it like  What's in it?  I don't know  It's a bunch of different things  But it's just disorganized  You know  Like you would just  Wake up in the middle of the night  And go hey  Let me type away here  And some ideas  That just spill out of you  Yeah  And also my  My divorce was a big thing  But I  Oh  I didn't realize it at the time  I was like  I forced it to happen 
[00:29:00]  But you know what I mean  Do you back up your fucking stuff  On computers stupid  Or no?  Oh boy  What's wrong with him?  I had this vision  This guy's opening up here  I'll tell you why  I had this vision of him  Writing for years  And he's such a  Losing it in one power surge  So I'm like  Yeah  Do you back it up?  Of course  I have anything  Don't say of course  Back that shit up  You're savvy  So you never got over the divorce?  No  But I think that affected me greatly  Oh  Why?  I'm over it because it had to  Stupid wives  Because Colin was in love 
[00:29:30]  Oh  Was that it?  Sorry  He wasn't in a miserable marriage  I was in a short marriage  Yeah  He wasn't married for a long time  It was a short one  It was a short one  Oh man  I was living with him for a while  Do you see like that  Was it your fault?  Do you think?  I don't think you can find anybody in the world  That could say it was anything but my fault  Really?  Yeah  There's no  I literally left her no choice  It's a hundred percent  Wow  No choice  If there's a hundred percent of anything in the world 
[00:30:00]  Do you want to share?  Get it off your chest?  Wow  I just literally left it like  She had no choice but to leave  Like what type of things were you doing  That a woman would not enjoy  Or want to be around  Well he is the ultimate thing  What I really did in the long run  To chase her away  Was cheated on her  And then told her  I'm not saying I'm going to not cheat again  Oh my god  Right  All right  Who do you think that?  Gene Simmons?  That's pretty much a hundred percent  Wow  You know  I was waiting for the explanation of a hundred percent  He just nailed it  Yeah  There's not a better definition of a hundred percent 
[00:30:30]  Than that right there  You really are forcing a person  To be pushing him right out of there  Yeah  If you would have like begged and said  Oh I'm sorry  I absolutely wouldn't do this again  Then you could say  All right  At least you tried  There might be a glimmer of hope  But when you say  You might go to therapy  And figure this out together  Exactly  But when you say  Or if it's like 1973  It's me and Kevin Kline  In the ice storm  You know  Standing there in our jackets  Honey it's a swinging world  But yeah  I just left it a choice  You know  Wow  And that bothers you? 
[00:31:00]  Well it bothers me  Because you know  Yeah  It does bother me a little bit  Then why'd you  Why'd you cheat?  Well at the time  It didn't bother me  Oh okay  And then you realize  That you really blew it  And this was it  I have to say  My work  The things I've been working on  Are just  The fact that I've written  Certain amounts of shows  And certain amounts of movies  That don't get done  That are really like  What should be done  And I just feel like  They end up doing  Crummy versions of it eventually  It really makes me so angry  Yeah  About show business  I can't even 
[00:31:30]  I can't even talk about  I can't jokingly talk about  The level of fury  That I feel about it  Yeah  And I know that relative  To a six year old  Like a Sudanese child  My problems mean nothing  To me they're actually  More important  That's where we differ  But compared to the people  That I know  Do certain things  Or get certain  Success  I can't help it  I know it's the  I know it's the cliche  Of bitterness  But I know that my work  It all should be done  I prove it  I prove it every time  I do get some things 
[00:32:00]  And I just want to burn down  About eight networks  And kill about  Five thousand people  Dude  Same crap happens to us  In this radio business man  It's amazing  That how  How hard they make this  Yeah  How hard they make this  Opie  We have a show  Yeah Opie  See the one difference is  You guys have a show  See  Well  We have a show  Without getting into detail  Trust me we can relate  Let's just put it that way  I think what Colin needs  My opinion  Because Colin told me  Other management problems he had 
[00:32:30]  I think you need  A fucking good manager  That's what I think  Because the stuff is really  Fucking  Colin's very funny  Very smart  Clever guy  And the idea that  Yeah  For years  You're throwing your stuff  Out there  And these fucking  Like pieces of shit  Get on TV  Get TV shows  Huge tours  Whatever the fuck it is  It's like  There's no justice  In the business  But it's not like  There was supposed to be  Though  Examples of some great stuff 
[00:33:00]  Though  Who's your caddy  The caveman series  Is terrific  Exactly  But I don't think  That Jim's answer is correct  I'm not gonna  My answer is not  Getting Commander McBrag  No  I'll tell you why I said that  Shut up  And let the laugh finish  Commander McBrag  That's a big laugh  It was a  Brr  There we were  I forgot  My goodness  What did you do McBrag  Well I pulled out a  Toothpick  You know 
[00:33:30]  It was during the making  Of License to win  So of course  We shot in Mozambique  As you know  Because there's the finest  Hunting in the lab  One time  Shut up  And let it happen  I stopped  One time  Kyle licensed to win  What are you trying  To defend your company  Shut the fuck up  No  Let us laugh  At the shit they put out  I don't even know  What you're talking about  I swear to god  I don't know  Who Commander McBrag is  I swear to god  Really?  That I believe  Yeah I don't know  But obviously  Me and Kyle  We talked one time  And he was talking  About his manager  At the time  Being annoying  Oh he's supposed 
[00:34:00]  To be the manager  But you know  Yeah  I ask him  He's got more sense  Whoa  If I don't get my script sold  I lose $15,000  That's right  Oh  So I fucking  Coffee  In a minute  Bring me to coffee  But he was complaining  About his fucking manager  And he's going  Trying to get his manager  To push harder  For his scripts  And you need somebody  That fucking says  This is a great script  And is a fucking animal  And fucking makes the calls  And pushes through  Not somebody that's fucking  Wishy washy with it 
[00:34:30]  To me that's important  Wishy washy  You don't want  Yeah I mean  It's true  You got a wishy washer  It's the truth  I don't have any manager  Or any agent right now  But exactly  For two years  That's silly  No it's not  No guys  Let me tell you something  Please  I would write  I would write  I would read a Colin Quinn book  So you got to find your angle  Well I mean but  I don't know  I don't know  Do you write on pop culture  Do you write about your life  Do you write about  I write about everything  Stand up  Yeah but you got to find  Like some kind of angle  She talks about it  Here's what Colin's book should be

[01:36:00]  Oh man  We played your appearance  On Leno again  He's like  Enough of that  No you know what it is  I don't  And I was just joking  I think  People just need to  Light  A joke  Well you know what it is  You don't have to tell us  You could get suspended  For actually having an opinion  That's different  Than everybody else  Like  And they send you to the shop  Like you  The defective robot  This is the bad robot  He actually thinks differently  Than everybody else  You don't have to be fixed  Right  Take the blue pill  Go back to the Matrix 
[01:36:30]  That's a great way to look at it  Man and you just  You know  And I don't even understand  How do you get fired  I mean suspended from a show  Where people hate  Or pay  Yeah  To hear the stuff y'all do  That's what we said  Yeah we got suspended for $30  Days  Right  Yeah I mean  What happened to I'm  Has almost happened to us  And all we're trying to do  Is entertain people  Right  And then  Well you gotta do it the way  And then you don't even  Get a chance to explain  What happened that day  Cause all of a sudden  They're running like  A 10 second clip  From the bid on  Lawyers jump in  Don't tell  You know what  Don't tell me 
[01:37:00]  I mean I'm telling literally  I've been boycotted  And picketed  Yeah  Didn't they protest you  In Dallas or something  In Dallas man  But it was just like  The weakest  Is three dudes  And uh  But three dudes  Can have a lot of power  That's what we argue  All the time  It's like  Tell these special interest groups  To shut up  And we're gonna run  Our own company  The way we want to  But you know what  The thing about it  They can do that  When you run  Like you literally  Work for a corporation  So you're a corporate  Shields  I mean no disrespect  Hey none at all  I'm thinking  That's not true  My comment was sponsored 
[01:37:30]  By Bud Light  Brought to you by Bud Light  Always worth it  When you boycotted  Comedian  I'm like  I don't work for nobody  Yeah you're pretty much  I just sell more tickets  Independent contractor  You can say whatever  The hell you want  Who's gonna protest you  I'm not gonna fire me  Yeah  I'm the last one  I've decided to fire myself  You gotta call  The big press conference  Get the podium  All the microphones  I've decided I am irresponsible  Right  I am firing myself  I've had enough  Of my unintelligent comments 
[01:38:00]  And I'm gonna  Effective immediately  Right right right  How great would it be  If you got in front of  You know a bunch of press  And started a boycott  On yourself  Right  I'm gonna announce  A boycott  I'd be fantastic  I'm gonna do it  Do it  Hey you know what  I promise  I'm serious  Hey Red  That's what  I'm gonna boycott myself  Just boycott yourself  Yeah that'd be hilarious  I'm gonna do it  And they would be  Sitting there like  Oh we gotta run this  On the news  It's D.L. Hughley  I'm gonna join the people  That are boycot  I'm gonna boycott myself  I gotta hurry up 
[01:38:30]  Cause I got a show to do  I boycott myself  In between shows  In between shows  I'm gonna call the news  You gotta make a living  You gotta watch me boycott  Yeah yeah  Now I gotta ask you  That's hilarious  They will  That's the first bit  I'm gonna do  Oh the news will too  They're vultures  Now on radio  We already know we're not safe  Like we're gonna say  Something stupid  And we're just gonna  Try to entertain somebody  And we're gonna get  In trouble again  But if you're  How does a grown man  Get in trouble  But if you're a cartoon  Or if you're doing  The same type of material  On a TV show  Or on a movie 
[01:39:00]  It's fine  But radio for some reason  We're the scums of society  It's not just radio  Music is  Well the music  The rap thing  Is still going to go after  It really is not  Now that  You know what  I honestly  And I really respect  Anybody's right  To disagree  I think it's arrogant  To go  I don't like something  So I believe  Nobody should have  The right to see it  That's what I  And that's just really  I don't  And people are always  You're apologizing  For Don Limous  Damn Don  I don't even  I don't know him  I never met him  I'm arguing for his 
[01:39:30]  Right to say  What he wants to say  That's all I'm saying  Because I am going  To then say  What I want to say  That's right  You have the best quote too  That's right  They wanted you to  Apologize in Dallas  It was  I'm not going to apologize  For making jokes  About life as I see it  Right  And it's amazing  As comics  How they expect you  To apologize  Or you have to justify  Why you're laughing  At something  Right  Somebody said  It's disgusting  I don't know  The Dallas situation  What happened  These ministers  Can you say it  Yeah  Oh yeah  These ministers  And it's always  And this was 
[01:40:00]  Something you did  In the comedy club  Well no  It was Jay Leno  Okay  Right  They took the clip  From Jay Leno  And they were upset  That I made the jokes  Oh okay  And then they didn't want  I was playing a performing arts center  And they didn't want me  To play the performing arts center  So they called  Just like Caroline's got a call  And the guy asked them  To pull a show  No  Just because of what  You said on Leno  Yeah but three months ago  What they getting this on  Telekite  Pony Express delivering this  Special delivery  Message  And then they said  They said 
[01:40:30]  They said  You know  He called them  First off  I never call them hoes  But now they want to  Ban the word ho  And I'll stop saying ho  When I stop seeing them  I know a few hoes  I really do  And I love hoes  I'm hoping to meet  Three or four tonight  Just because you  Stop saying ho  They're going to stop  Like what  They're going to disappear  If five dudes  Playing to be your baby daddy  At the same time  You a ho  Just be ho  What is that all about  You got to be  Plenty correct  They're not hoes  They're girls 
[01:41:00]  Who know the value  Of a dollar  Right  I don't understand it man  I don't  Oh man  So it was very refreshing  He said  I ain't apologizing  Right  But it was a very eloquent  Way to put it  Because it was  Without anger  You know  I tend to react  Too angrily  And I lose my point  But that was  A perfect way  To put it  And the way  You explained it  On Leno  Was a perfect way  To put it  About look  This is the reality  And this is what  I want to say  Well you know  What it is  When people  That are different  Like I've said  Whatever  I've said 
[01:41:30]  I've been consistent  From the beginning  If you watch me  20  10 years ago  I have the same point  John Rocker said  Something 10-15 years ago  On Kings of Comedy  I said he had the right  To say it  This ain't new for me  I'm not a new guy  Who just all of a sudden  I've always felt like  When Michael Richards  Said what he said  I didn't like it  He had the right to say it  I know what I  If you call me  If I say that word  If you call me a nigga  And I know I ain't one  Then why am I gonna  How do you call somebody  A hoe in Chicago  And a woman in Florida  Get mad  What is it 
[01:42:00]  Is it a hoe hotline  What is it  I mean  I don't understand  They're all connected  You know that  I don't understand  And I get that  They're all sisters  They're all sisters  Man  They're sticking up  For each other  No matter what  I get that  Some of the things  That people say  But I am a nightclub act  That's right  People come out at night  With drinks and nachos  To hear me say  Some of the most vile  Shit you could say  Right  That's what they pay me for  And I'm supposed to pretend  Like I don't say that  What committee on decency 
[01:42:30]  Like even if you tell me  About Don I'm  How does taking the show  Off the air  That we didn't even know  Was on help us  Yeah I really don't think  I don't think any of the  Rutgers team was  Listening to Don I'm  They probably wouldn't  Have known about any of that  If people that  Told them  Hey look  You better be affected  By this  And here's my thing  I  Anybody has the right  To argue about my point  Anybody has the right  To say  I don't like that  And that  You have the power  To come see me 
[01:43:00]  Or not see me  But if I got a microphone  I'm going to say  What the fuck  I believe  Not what you want me to believe  That's it  Why not  I'm not going to let  Some dude  That I don't even know  Tell me what I believe  Is decent  You don't know my experiences  I'd love to have  Bill Cosby's career  Or Sinbad's career  I just don't see the world  The way they do it  Bill Cosby more than Sinbad  Right  Yeah yeah yeah  No but I'm saying  You should have stopped  With Bill Cosby  Sinbad up until 95  But it's just  It's just like  I don't get it  And it's like  Then you do stuff  That I don't understand 
[01:43:30]  Like even if  You know  And I said this bit  On my HBO special  I don't understand  We have real problems  In our community  And if you're going to be  A civil rights activist  You have to address  The stuff that really goes on  One in three black people  In this country  Can't read  93% of black people  In this country  Killed by other black people  There are more black men  In general than college  You can worry about  What I'ma says  But I guess that makes sense  Because apparently  That was the one white man  That was holding us back  Yeah  Now that he's gone  Jubilee  All those problems  Are going to be solved  But it's easy though 
[01:44:00]  That's the easy stuff  To go after  It's the easy target  And stuff  And I don't know why  It just annoys  The crap out of me  That you can't get  A black leader  That addresses those issues  Seriously  And gets to the  But gets to the point  Publicly  Where they're like  Up there  And as well known  As Al Sharpton  Well  Here's the thing  I don't want to  Lead anybody  I don't want to  Change anybody's life  I'm going to just  Keep doing what I do  Like  I don't think  What I do is important 
[01:44:30]  I don't think  What I do matters  I don't care  You know  I'm not  I'm not  You know  Like  I'm not standing  On a podium  Saying  Like  They have a tendency  To kind of say  Since I said it  It's reflective of  Of a view I have  Of the whole  No man  I gotta  Here's the thing  I came from  A nappy head mama  And I'm a nappy head daddy  And I got nappy head kids  I can't make a comment  Yeah you're not allowed  I can't weigh in  On this issue  It's just to me  But if I  Now I will  I will sit and say  The same thing 
[01:45:00]  On Tom Jordan's show  I'll sit and say it  On you know  BET  I got a show on BET  But if I sit in front  Of white dudes  If I have the exact  Same conversation  In front of white dudes  Then I'm saying  Something crazy  I'm going to be  Whoever I am  I said what I said  On Jay Leno  I said it on BET  I'll say it on HBO  It don't make me  A difference where I said  I'm going to be  Who I am  Regardless of who's around me  It seems that  Like a lot of times  Black guys  If you disagree  A certain way  There's a whole other  Racial angle  From other black people  Like white guys  Or white people  If we say something  Conservatives will come  After us 
[01:45:30]  Or liberals will come  After us  But it's almost like  With black guys  You have the other  Angle of  Hey you're not  You're kind of  Disagreeing publicly  You're saying something  Publicly in front of  White people  You know what  All I can say is this  I don't get the memo  They didn't give me  The memo  I never get the email  That says what  The part  Like I watch people  Get offended when  Barack Obama got  Called articulate  You can't call them  You can't say the n-word  You can't say articulate  You can't say  White people are going  What can we call these people 
[01:46:00]  That'll make them happy  Some newscasts  I'm like  He is very well spoken  Right  It's like  Well what does that mean  Yeah  What are you getting at  With that comment  We're losing our minds  And you know what it is  I literally  I was doing a show  And this Asian dude  I said Oriental  And he hopped up  And said I'm not Oriental  I said man how do I know  Right  All I know is y'all  All run from Godzilla  The same way  That's all the hell I know  I don't know  Oriental is stuff  Right right  I don't get it  Yeah that's from 
[01:46:30]  And for years it was Oriental  Oriental Oriental guy  And then it changed  And went from no  Oriental is a thing  Right  It's like an Oriental rug  Or something like that  Right  We are Asian  I didn't get a minute  I didn't know  No one told me  Right  No memo came in  I didn't get that  But I thought you guys  Were supposed to be  On subscription radio  So that you could say  Well that's  Yeah  Well that's  Nine o'clock  That's  Nine o'clock  You curse all the way  We're still on regular  FM radio  We're on both right now  That's all right  We're on regular till nine 
[01:47:00]  And then we're on  Super unleaded  Yeah  Oh then it becomes  Yeah  I gotta stay till nine  Damn it  I gotta get on it  Oh yeah  Believe me  This is like the  White Def Jam  I'm into this  Yeah once nine hits  All bets are off  But it got to the point  Because you know  We work for  Like you said  A corporation  That you have to  Adhere to their rules  And it really isn't  A freedom of speech issue  Because it's a freedom  Of whatever the hell  The corporate ties  Want you to say  Or not say  Based on advertisers 
[01:47:30]  And stuff like that  But you  You have a mic  You get up on stage  Why the hell  Can't you say  Whatever you want  Whatever  You know  Here's the thing  Ultimately  It is the public  That will decide  Yeah  They'll tolerate from it  Yep  Right  It'll be the public  But people  And Jim  You've seen me  I talk about  Every single issue  I'm like  I talk about  Social  I talk about  As many social issues  As any comic I know  Like war  Peace  You know  The  The  The  The  Sim cell  I mean  I'll talk about  Anything 
[01:48:00]  So they'll take  One small thing  That I said  And that will  Indite the whole thing  And I'm just saying this  I really personally  Don't believe  I believe freedom of speech  Is kind of a zero sum proposition  I believe if I'm going  To be able to say something  I can then not  I'd be hypocritical  If I denied anybody else  The right to say it  Like that's  All  That's my whole  There's common sense  In when you  Say things  And when you don't say things  There's basic common sense  That will keep you  From getting your ass  Ass beat  Right  That's for sure  But I mean  Especially in comedy 
[01:48:30]  Comedy  Because comedy  There should be  No limits man  None  If you can make  If you can make  Fun  And make people laugh  Out of some heinous crap  You should be able to do it  That's a talent  Right  That is a genuine talent  If people aren't laughing  Like you said  The public will decide  And go  You know  I saw that guy  He's just an ass  He's not funny  You're not going to go back  To see him next time  He's in town  Or maybe some people  See him some people won't  But comedy  Is then put under  This microscope  For some reason  Of late 
[01:49:00]  Where even that  Is being treated  Like I said  Like national public radio  Like this show  Is being treated  With the same rules  As NPR is  Right  Now so if some guy  On NPR  Gets up there  And starts talking  About bitches  But only four people  Listen  Yeah four people  Listening  And using the N word  Whichever one you want  To choose from now  There's a few N words  We're not allowed to use  Then we're going to  Get in trouble  But comedy  I just don't like  To hear grown people  Grown men  Saying they're going  To get in trouble 
[01:49:30]  In trouble  You're right  Like I'm not a kid  What's my father  Going to come down there  And take the keys away  When I'm going to get  A whooping or something  Remember when you were  A kid and getting older  Meant you weren't  Going to get in trouble  Anymore  That's what you grew up  That's what you took  Those beatings on your ass  From your father  So you could grow up  And not get beat anymore  And get in trouble  I  You know  And  Here's my whole thing  It's just a matter  Of common sense  You know now  In New York  They want to pass a bill 
[01:50:00]  That says you can't  Say the N word  Which  Well they buried  In Detroit  But if you  But if you took  A list of the problems  That I  That are in our communities  The N word would be  About 350  How about this  Now the N word  I don't know personally  If it ever killed anybody  But pork chops  And not exercising  Do  You know what I'm saying  They do  That's going to creep up  On you  Eventually  You eat enough pork  And sit still  And you know  That's the deal  What tends to happen 
[01:50:30]  Is that you can't say  Hey you know what  We're overweight  We don't do this  We don't do that  Then you're wrong  But you can say  Make a symbolic gesture  Like killing the N word  And the same day  That you were symbolically  Burying the N word  Probably four brothers  In Detroit  Really got buried  Because of violence  Yeah  So it's just dumb to me  And I don't pretend  To know anything like that  We were amazed  That the mayor of Detroit  Went with that whole bit  Like actually burying  The N word  In a pine box  At a funeral  You know something 
[01:51:00]  It's kind of hard  For the mayor  To not show up though  The mayor kind of  Has to show up  The mayor can't go  Oh that's silly  Keep it alive  We ain't talking  About Vermont  The mayor of Vermont  Wouldn't show up for that  But the mayor did  It was just so silly  How about you show up  At other funerals  Gang related  Killing funerals  And speak out  Against that  That's a little more  Something to grab onto  But that's real  Than this symbolic thing  But that's real  You can't have  We don't really want  Which is like  That is symptomatic 
[01:51:30]  Of the whole country  We don't really want  To do anything  We just want to  Give symbolic gestures  Like after 9-11  Remember they had  The National Guard  Standing around  Oh yeah yeah  They didn't want  To change anything  They just want people  To think that they  Feel better about it  And that's just it  So our job  Is as a comedian  And I just  You want to keep  Pounding this ad nauseum  I'm not trying  To change people's perceptions  I'm not trying  To get a rallying group  Together  I'm not trying  To get people  To follow me  I don't want  To change the world  I want to laugh at it 
[01:52:00]  Yeah  I want it to stay  Just as vile  And sick as it is  Or I won't have  Any material  Exactly  We're losing  The battle though  Something's got to change  Yep  You're right  If everything is great  And everybody's getting along  And there's racial harmony  You're on stage  You're going to go  Hello  Right  Everyone's out having fun  Life sucks  When everything is great  They wouldn't even be  At the comedy clubs  They'd be enjoying  Their lives  Not just sitting there  Drinking like fish  Saying please  Someone else  Make me laugh  Everyone I know  Can't do it  And Jim will tell you 
[01:52:30]  The more  The harder stuff gets  The more depressed people are  The meaner the world gets  The better comedy does  Absolutely  And again  As long as you're not  Trying to change people's lives  It's like  No we're not that arrogant  We just want to make  I'm not pompous enough  To think that I have  A tremendous influence  Some of the best comics  Came out at some of the worst times  Man look at the 60s  Vietnam  All the  Talk about  But this is not Vietnam  Yeah yeah  That's what people don't understand  Right right  This is our time  And I say that all the time  This is our kind of  There haven't been this kind of 
[01:53:00]  Political and social upheaval  Since the 60s  And a division  Of the country  Like people are so divided  On party lines  And as far as the war goes  So there is this turmoil going on  That comedians feed off of  But people are seeing it  As this political incorrectness  That needs to be  Thrown under a carpet somewhere  Right  No  I'm your illegitimate child  You don't want to  Yeah yeah please  Here's a couple of bucks  Get out of here  Don't ever call me daddy  Yeah 
[01:53:30]  But it's just  And I think that it is  Comedians  And I say this all the time  I like mirrors  And generally mirrors  Show you a lot of things  You don't want to see  And that is what  We're reflective of  Goddamn  I didn't come from  A foreign planet  I'm from this earth  I ain't from a vacuum  I've seen the same things  You have  I've watched the same things  You do  But I have a different  If I had the same  Kind of take that you did  I'd be the banker  That's driving to work  Wanting to kill himself  Right now  I'd be the guy  Who's going through a job 
[01:54:00]  I love my job  Because I get  Art  Somebody said this to me  Michael Dyson  Said this to me  And he said  That art  And I consider comedy  The highest form of art  Makes you uncomfortable  It makes you  It's nonconforming  You're not supposed  To sit down and go  Wow that really soothes me  If you want to be soothed  Get some fish  I'm not here  I'm here to tell you  I'm not here to  Get a cat  A parakeet  I'm not that  You want people  Questioning themselves  Like I can't believe  I'm laughing at this  What is wrong with me  He's absolutely right  About the uncomfortable thing 
[01:54:30]  And stuff  Like there have been  Movies I've watched  Good movies  Sit there  Watch them  They're done  You just don't even  Think about them again  If there's a movie  That like  All of a sudden  The credits start rolling  And you're like  They better not  Start rolling the credits  What the hell  You're not finished  This movie isn't done yet  And it gets you so pissed  Like I'm sitting there  With my chick  Discussing it  An hour later  Going  What happened with this  Why did they do this  Because it's  It's different  Than everything else  It left you feeling  Like you needed  Something more  It made you uncomfortable 
[01:55:00]  It was  I was pissed  When I was done  Sometimes that  It makes you more alive  It makes you discuss more  It makes you feel like  You're in it  People never really seem  To get this  But the simplest things  To be different  All you gotta be  Is who you are  To be different  All you gotta do  Is be  All I'm trying to do  Honestly  Is be who I am  I don't wanna ask  For permission  I refuse to ask  For permission  To be  What am I supposed to do  Well this might be funny  I should pass it  By the decency committee  To see  If they're gonna  Approve this 
[01:55:30]  And I hope they get back  To me in time  Because I gotta sue  At 7 o'clock  You're hurting us  Because we have that committee  It's called  Corporate lawyers  Lawyers  Funny people  Never making determinations  It's never  It's not like people  Who run comedy  Or who are in charge of it  Are funny  They're nerds  They've never been funny  In their lives  So they're making determinations  On what's appropriate  We don't walk into  The lawyer's office  And he sits there  Squeezes something  And his tie pops up  And he's just having a blast  He squirts us  With a carnation  And tells us  We can do any bit we want  Oh he's awful  It never happens 
[01:56:00]  Those lawyers are nothing  But granite  They're just  Shakers  They are  Body spoke  The dead  Shake her hands  A little party zapper  Wouldn't that be funny  Ha ha sit down  You know what makes us  The most uncomfortable  Is sex  Sex  Race  Like sex  You always hear  Some right wing  Republican  Who was  Like he's  Some right wing nut job  Who was pro family  And against this  And you'll find out  He's  Screwing hookers  Oh yeah 
[01:56:30]  Or maybe something's  On his computer  And yeah  Mark Foley  That Republican  That naughty boy  That Mark Foley was  You're a naughty boy  David Bitter  Bill O'Reilly  And his trouble  That we all  Yeah  Bill O'Reilly  Swept that under the carpet  With a little settlement  And now he's wearing  A wedding ring  You see that  Yeah yeah  Well he's a family guy  Come on  Give me a break  It's hypocrisy man  And his sister used to  Come to the office  With a little league  Chest protector on  If you didn't  I don't understand him  So you know  And I'm not 
[01:57:00]  The greatest thing  About what I get to do  Is I don't  I don't ever  Take myself seriously  And I never  Like I never believe  I'm as good as I think I am  Or I never believe  I'm as bad as they say I am  I believe that  That if you  Don't like what I'm saying  You won't come see me  And if you do  You will  And I'm not going to  Kiss your ass either way  If you don't  Fuck you  I mean  I'm sorry  But that was for the  8 o'clock  Yeah yeah  By the way  I don't want that  That actually got  The $200,000  It got through on XM  Do you have to get out of here  No man I'm staying 
[01:57:30]  Oh someone said  You have to leave at 825  I don't work for nobody  I'm not kidding  When somebody  It's him  He's the guy  He all has to leave  At 830  Wait I have to protest me  Yeah he's protesting  He's got to pick it  I know  That was your  That was your out  Just in case it wasn't going well  Look guys  I gotta be out at 830  Wait what  Does he have more press  No he's right here  I know  He's the guy  I'm saying  I gotta talk to me  Hang on  Yeah  He's gonna have a meeting with himself  Greg's just creepy  He just brings people around
