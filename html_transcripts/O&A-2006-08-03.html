<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor, referencing their numerous arrests and using offensive language to describe themselves.  They highlighted the unexpected popularity of their recurring jingle, "Back in the New York Room," as ringtones and a YouTube video, acknowledging their online content's somewhat "boring" nature despite a dedicated fan's uploading efforts.  E-Roc's new haircut became a target of extensive mockery.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a demo parody of a fictional Whoopi Goldberg morning show, featuring suggestive and sexually charged dialogue and a repetitive theme song, which was played and parodied repeatedly.  Rob Bartlett's appearance on *Imus in the Morning* wearing an Opie and Anthony t-shirt was discussed, with audio clips played later in the show.

A listener called in, confessing addiction to the show.  The *New York Daily News* published a full-page article detailing their feud with Howard Stern, who allegedly threatened to block their appearance on *The Late Show with David Letterman*. Opie and Anthony issued a public challenge to Stern.  Audio of a news report interrupted by a listener shouting "O&A Party Rock" highlighted their media stunt encouraging listener disruptions of live news broadcasts, with the hosts discussing the resulting fallout, including reporter reactions and the New Jersey governor's involvement.  A video of an intoxicated Mel Gibson was also discussed.

The show featured extensive clips from "Mondo Topless Part 2," a Russ Meyer film showcasing topless women (Darlene Gray, Luscious Sin, Darla Paris, and Diane Young among others), accompanied by crude and offensive commentary from the hosts about the women's appearances and intelligence. Jim Norton played a character repeatedly interrupting a sleep expert during an interview, with Opie insulting the guest.  The hosts discussed their dynamic in such interactions. Patrice O'Neal's tardiness was a topic of conversation, along with upcoming live shows, ticket sales, and Doug Stanhope. A game was introduced involving Big A, who was challenged to say words starting with "ST," with the hosts betting on his ability to do so without censoring himself.

Big A, a regular contributor, featured prominently, particularly in a recurring bit where his pronunciation difficulties, especially with words starting with "st" and containing "electr," became a target of relentless mockery.  A Russ Meyer-style promotional announcement for the show, created by Coke Logic, was aired. Big A's worn-out shoes led to a promise of new ones. Patrice O'Neal joined later for the "walkover" segment, which involved street interactions.  Patrice's recent trip to Brazil, particularly his separate hotel room arrangement with his girlfriend, was heavily discussed and mocked. Marty Lang, a regular caller and construction worker, phoned in to describe breaking his arm falling off a mezzanine, becoming another source of jokes. The segment, especially the latter half focused on Patrice's Brazilian anecdotes, became sexually explicit.

A segment focused on relationships from a male perspective, emphasizing the desire for companionship without constant interaction, the fear of loneliness, and the idea of maintaining interest by keeping a woman slightly uncertain. One host discussed his physical insecurities.  The surprise in-studio appearance of Whoopi Goldberg, a response to their previous criticisms of her radio show, significantly shifted the show's dynamic.  Whoopi addressed their concerns, engaged in banter, discussed her experiences, her public persona, and the difference between her and actors' approaches to comedy.  A misunderstanding about her comments at a public event and the media portrayal were addressed.  She advocated for prostate exams for men, sharing personal experiences.  Listener calls reacted to her presence and the tonal shift. The hosts' relationship with their listeners ("pests") and anxieties about their reaction were discussed.  Other celebrities, including Howard Stern, Tommy Lee, and Oprah Winfrey, were mentioned.

The show analyzed a comedic scene from *Lucky Louie*, comparing English and Spanish dubbed versions, criticizing the latter's poor translation and lack of a laugh track.  Danny, the Spanish dubber, was brought into the studio. A remote segment showed Danny and Big A attempting to buy shoes at "Make 10," marked by offensive language directed at a female employee and mocking comments about Big A's size and appearance.  Further *Lucky Louie* clips, focusing on the sexual content of a scene involving a teenage character, were discussed with explicit comments.  The final portion focused on extended, vulgar commentary about a show employee's ("Eric" or "Pinch Penny Eric") shirt and alleged miserliness. Patrice O'Neal and other guests were mentioned, and upcoming shows and appearances were promoted.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202, featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long!  Shut up!  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're loose.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, cornwalls, three retards. 
[00:00:30]  We have the effect of talent on XM.  Opie.  You know I can't have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm Derek.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Well, we're waiting.  Who wants to sing along today? 
[00:01:30]  Who wants to sing along to this?  No, you can't sing along to this.  No.  This just gives the show attitude.  Is that what it's meant for?  Like we're about to do something very important.  It's a ruse.  Stop what you're doing.  That's the music that starts the Opie and Anthony show.  Something important is about to be said.  We like it.  It's like Pavlov's dog. 
[00:02:00]  They hear this and start drooling for the show.  All right.  A sing along.  We're back, back in the New York room.  We're back, back in the New York room.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Favorite part. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  That has been entrenched in my head since I woke up this morning.  Driving in.  I'm just going.  One of those annoying things that just stick in your head.  Yeah.  You never know.  Like a tumor.  You never know what's going to stick on this program.  I thought that was kind of a throwaway.  I thought it was cute and stuff. 
[00:03:00]  No offense to Jimmy.  We had a drum set in the studio and Jimmy decided to play and just make crap up as he  was playing.  Yeah.  And I'm like, man, that was kind of funny and whatever.  It's taken on a life of its own.  Showing I don't know crap.  People want it as their ringtone and everything else.  Very catchy.  The video, I think, is up on YouTube.  It's just taking off.  Jimmy on the drums.  Isn't everything on YouTube?  Although I went to YouTube, just the site.  Usually people send you a link.  I've got to be honest. 
[00:03:30]  I was like, oh, that's cool.  And then I go to YouTube and I'm just like kind of browsing the videos.  And a lot of nothing on there.  Yeah, our videos on YouTube, boring.  Really?  I think so, yeah.  You can check out any of ours.  All the great things we've done and all the great things that have been videotaped over  the years are showing on YouTube.  I was just thinking about this yesterday because I Googled Opie and Anthony.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  Blacklust.  Oh, yeah.  And there's a guy out there. 
[00:04:00]  He's working his butt off.  And he's just another pest of the show.  And he's just adding Opie and Anthony videos to YouTube like day and night.  But so far, the showing is like, yeah, whatever.  You know, us on like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity.  And then I don't know.  They allow nudity on that.  I don't know.  Maybe that's why our videos are boring.  Been a lot of nudity.  Because the ones we're allowed to give them have no nudity.  Yeah.  All right.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:04:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  America, we have lots to do today.  I got to play this for you, though.  This is just wonderful.  We just got this in our hands about an hour ago.  Our grimy little hands.  Yes.  And if it cues up, I can play it.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Look at E-Roc's ready to...  To pounce?  Take control of the situation.  Ah, don't touch anything.  I think I got it.  There we go.  There's a new marine haircut today. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, I noticed.  Wow.  Yeah.  Private pile.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two.  Ah, damn.  Just looks like he has hair plugs.  And he doesn't have hair plugs.  He has too much hair that it makes it look like he has hair plugs.  He has a young, full head of hair.  But I don't know why.  There's something about it.  I just want to comb it with a bat.  He looks like those commercials where you can swim and you can work out. 
[00:05:30]  But we just never see the before picture.  Right.  It's always just after E-Roc.  After the picture.  After he gets out of the pool.  Yeah.  It shows that his fake hair looks quite real.  He's showing his hair on the fake camera.  He's showing his hair.  He puts the Pal Talk camera on himself.  E-Roc has really learned in the last two years.  We're up to about two years with E-Roc.  You know that?  Wow.  And at first, he just couldn't take a joke.  He couldn't take a good ribbing.  And now he's just like, here you go, Pal Talk.  Here's my awful hair and my brand new awful haircut. 
[00:06:00]  That's what this show's about.  Just smashing each other.  Yeah.  Oh, well, okay.  How do you not love Rob Bartlett?  Rob Bartlett.  Can you get the audio immediately?  Rob Bartlett's on Imus right now.  Doing his...  He's doing weather.  As is Brian Wilson character.  Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys.  And he has one of our Opie and Anthony t-shirts on.  Which you can get at MyRadioStore.com.  We'll get the audio. 
[00:06:30]  I have a feeling Imus is going to be talking about us today.  We'll get into that in a few minutes.  But first, I got this that I want to play for everybody.  All right.  Hey, I'm Whoopi Goldberg.  And I have the perfect solution for your morning show.  Me?  Cubby.  Yes.  What time is it?  Whoopi, it is 6 o'clock.  Ooh, it's time to wake up with Whoopi.  Now, don't make me come in there and pull those covers off, child.  I'll be back in two minutes.  That's all I need, girl.  I heard.  Wake up with Whoopi.  I loop that Wake Up with Whoopi song.  I want it played 24 hours a day on this very station. 
[00:07:00]  Well, you know, Whoopi's our big competition here in New York City.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Wow.  Oh, she'll get you to wake up.  Can you imagine?  Whoopi in your bedroom naked and she was trying to crawl into bed with you to spoon.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Oh, you'll get right there, Pop.  Your alarm goes off.  You hit the snooze.  You roll over.  Whoa.  That's what we'll be doing in here.  Does he call her girl?  Yes, that's what I wanted to address.  You have to play that again because Cubby is urbanizing himself a bit. 
[00:07:30]  All right.  By the way.  He's running the urban lingo.  Going back slightly.  Coke Logic, he wants a little plug because he came up with the Back in the New York Groove remix.  Okay.  Give him the plug.  Just go to MySpace.com slash Coke Logic and check him out.  But he took what Jimmy did and added horns and stuff and made it a little nicer.  All right.  Here it is once again, Ant.  Hey, I'm Whoopi Goldberg and I have the perfect solution for your morning show.  Me?  Cubby?  Yes.  What time is it? 
[00:08:00]  Whoopi, it is 6 o'clock.  Ooh, it's time to wake up with Whoopi.  Now, don't make me come in there and pull those covers off, child.  I'll be back in two minutes.  That's all I need, girl.  I heard.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Why is Cubby doing that?  That's all I need, girl.  That's all I need, girl.  Mm-hmm.  Have you seen the Cubster?  Have you seen Cubby?  He's whiter than I.  I swear to you.  Not even the color.  He could have a tan.  It doesn't matter.  He looks like Cupid. 
[00:08:30]  Like just cherubish.  He should be holding a bow and arrow and be nude with maybe a little something covering the sensitive region.  On one foot with the other one bent slightly behind him, holding back an arrow with water coming out of his mouth like a fountain.  He's as white-looking as you can get.  Oh, yeah.  He makes Eric look like Isaac Hayes.  You want to hear more Whoopi? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, I sure do, girl.  Stop it.  We got our hands on the Whoopi demo.  Oh.  Holla.  She's our big competition here in New York.  I don't know what we're going to do.  We're going to wake up with Whoopi.  Oh, that is an awful theme.  A horrible little song.  Who did they hand that off to?  We need something, a song, that has sort of a wake up with Whoopi sound to it.  Okay.  Wake up with Whoopi.  How's that?  That'll do.  Cut.  Print it.  Perfect.  Little dab will do you. 
[00:09:30]  I like to wear women's clothing.  If you threw it together quickly, it would sound like a lousy song.  A man of his racial confusion would have trouble walking through doors.  Let's say hi to Rob in White Plains.  Rob, what's up?  What up, girls?  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla, White Plains.  So, thanks to Whoopi at 6.06 in the morning, I get to do chills. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That'll wake you up.  I got to go to work.  Peace.  That'll wake you up, though.  I can't get my visual out of my head.  You're naked, coming into your bedroom, trying to get in bed with you.  Waking you up.  Waking you up.  Grab a spoon as you hit the snooze alarm.  Let's go to Nick in New York.  Nick, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  I just want to let you know you've successfully infected me with your virus.  You guys are doing a great job.  I'm now waking up early, leaving my family of four, trying to get on the road. 
[00:10:30]  You have to listen to you guys.  Oh, you're addicted.  You're addicted.  Nice.  It's coursing through your bloodstream.  Thank you, Nick.  All right, then.  All right.  Thank you, Nick.  Good job.  Thanks, guys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Why don't we play more Whoopi from her demo that we got our hands on?  Please.  Live from New York City, it's time to wake up with Whoopi.  So come.  Yes, Whoopi Goldberg.  You like saying my name, don't you?  Whoopi Goldberg.  Yes.  Say it again.  The legendary Whoopi Goldberg.  That's right.  The incredible Whoopi Goldberg. 
[00:11:00]  You haven't seen the ratings yet.  What ratings?  Well, like I care.  All right.  Well, this is on the demo.  This is supposed to get people really interested in the radio show.  I'll tell you what's very good.  At least she doesn't care.  Yeah, because I have a feeling you're going to care a lot.  I don't care in six months or so.  It's a tough whole business.  Way up with Whoopi.  With Whoopi.  Can we please have that song?  I'm going to hear that again. 
[00:11:30]  Just so you can hit a button and we can hear that.  I just want to hear that.  Like, I wish that was in the machine, you see.  All right.  So when I'm down, you could just hit that.  Yeah, get that in our sound machine.  Whoopi, it is six o'clock.  Oh, it's time to wake up with Whoopi.  Now, don't make me come in there and pull those covers off, shall I?  Two minutes.  All right, girl.  I heard.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Oh, God.  Let's get that stuck.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Let's get that stuck in everyone's head today.  Yep.  Wake up with Whoopi.  That's all I need, girl. 
[00:12:00]  Holla.  Wake up.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Oh, is that an awful little theme song?  Well, hey.  We're back.  Back in the New York groove.  I want to do a duet with that wake up with Whoopi.  Oh, I'm sure you do.  And make an Opie and Anthony Whoopi theme so the shows can come together in harmony.  Holla.  Holla.  Wake up with O and A.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just change it around.  All right, listeners.  There's your homework. 
[00:12:30]  All right, here we go.  Whoopi wakes up Anthony.  What?  Part of the demo.  Hello?  Hey, Anthony.  Hey.  Do you know who this is?  No.  This is Whoopi Goldberg.  No.  Yes, baby.  You know I have a radio show now, and it's called Waking Up with Whoopi.  And we were told by your mother, Claire, that you have a little trouble getting out of  the bed, Anthony.  Were you out late last night, baby?  Yeah, a little bit.  You're not going back to bed, are you?  Oh, yeah.  I'm going back to bed.  Oh, Anthony.  Come on, baby.  Just get up one time, because you like to move it, move it. 
[00:13:00]  You like to move it, move it.  Yeah.  We're going to send you a mug, baby.  Letting us wake you up in the morning.  Don't you dare hit that snooze button.  It's time to wake up with Whoopi.  I'm not going to hit the snooze button.  I'm going to smash my clock radio with a hammer.  Just take a ball-peen hammer to it.  You don't want Whoopi moving anything, man.  You don't want to see anything moving on her body.  Oh, wow. 
[00:13:30]  I like to move it, move it.  I like to move it, move it.  I like to move it, move it.  But then the fun thing is that you get a mug, a coffee mug, because she'll wake you up.  A good-natured.  Yeah, it's all good-natured.  She likes to move it, move it, her furniture back to L.A. in six months.  I like to move it, move it.  What's that?  The numbers from a 1.0 to a .01. 
[00:14:00]  She's going to have a Congo line to the bottom of the ratings.  With Covey yelling, holla, the whole time.  Holla!  I like to move it.  Try it, it's fun.  I like to move it, move it.  I like to move it, move it.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Ooh.  I like it.  A quick Whoopi promo.  She's on a first-name basis with Oscar, Tony, Emmy, and is not afraid to say that she loves her Grammy. 
[00:14:30]  Whoopi Goldberg.  I get it.  Like your grandma.  Some people call them Grammys.  Yeah.  Not afraid to.  We make you look like Silly Goose.  A little weak.  And finally.  Oh, Grammy.  But Grammy and her.  That's like a Grammy for a record.  The award.  Record.  Okay.  I never really confused.  Wake up with Whoopi.  What?  With Jimmy.  Wake up with Jimmy. 
[00:15:00]  I like that.  Go to the doctor.  He'll take care of it with penicillin.  Hopefully.  And finally, the end of the Whoopi demo.  This is a hell of a demo.  It's barely a minute.  I think it's, let me see.  A minute 15.  A minute 15 seconds.  It may be wake up with Whoopi, but I control your mic, darling.  Do you?  I'm going to break your kneecaps.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Oh, the song again. 
[00:15:30]  Wake up with Whoopi.  It just pops in.  Whenever you're feeling down, the song knows it and just shows up.  Yeah.  I'm getting the blues.  Wait.  No, I'm not.  It just pops in, and then you're happy again.  They should just loop that song and play it on their station the whole time.  Can you just get the stinger?  Just get that song.  Can somebody put that song over one of the Iraqi beheadings?  I would love to hear that loop.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Saw, saw, saw, saw. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  We're just getting warmed up.  Jesus.  We're going to take our first break.  We're going to break early for once.  Yeah.  Let's get caught up early.  We have lots to do today.  Lots and lots.  We got Mondo Topless Part 2 on the way.  A little more Mondo Topless.  We have, you know, I hear that that is a different guy doing the narration.  Yeah, I wasn't sure.  Because I went to Internet Movie Database based on somebody's bashing me on MySpace,  and that wasn't Russ Meyer doing that.  Oh, Russ Meyer.  Yeah, Russ Meyer doing that. 
[00:16:30]  And apparently it's some other guy, and he kind of dubs over the lines.  Like, Russ initially does them, and then he dubs over them because he's got that great-sounding voice.  Well, we got to find out who that guy is.  He must have done a lot of stuff in his career.  He did.  He had a pretty long list, so pop him up on IMDb.  He's still alive, too.  Still alive.  He may be.  But we got Mondo Topless Part 2.  The girls that are experiencing the art of the topless.  The art of the topless. 
[00:17:00]  They are going to speak today.  Thank God.  Mondo Topless Part 2.  Wake up with the topless.  The art of the topless.  That is the worst.  Also, Patrice O'Neill in studio starting at 7 o'clock.  Lunch is protuberances.  To help us hype the O&A traveling virus this Saturday at the DCU Center in Worcester, Mass.  We're so excited that after the show, we're on the road, man.  We'll be live from WBCN in Boston tomorrow morning.  I think I'm going up with you guys. 
[00:17:30]  You have to pack.  I have to pack.  Oh, boy.  Great.  See you at about midnight, Opie.  Yeah, I are.  No, it's great.  Opie doesn't pack.  I haven't packed yet.  Me neither.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, okay.  Good.  Good.  I was out last night.  But Jimmy, like, fleas.  Oh.  No, no.  It's my friend.  I was just talking about my friend.  Yeah.  I'm really in love.  I'm just like, you know.  Oh, wow.  Oh!  I know.  I had to pack the pack.  Jimmy, you're, like, you have to say anything.  There is not one person that you bump into on a daily basis that doesn't just know something's 
[00:18:00]  up with you.  Wake up with Whoopi.  See, now you're happy.  Now you understand all the icky stuff I did in front of you.  Yeah, I always understood that.  Now you can finally understand it.  I want to hear some stories.  He used to go like this.  To me.  Him and Lindsay were, like, two hummels.  It wasn't bad when she was standing there.  Hummels.  When she was standing there, it was fine.  I didn't even mind him kissing her.  It was that his eyes would close and he'd kiss her cheek.  He would, like, ooh.  And it was such a gentle little, I really wanted to just make them both into a little 
[00:18:30]  plaster thing and put them up in my grandmother's.  I love you dis much.  Big arms held apart.  At least I'm not playing patty cake.  All right.  So it happens.  What's wrong with a little bit of eye-hand coordination?  Jim Norton playing patty cake.  That was the case.  Wake up with patty cake.  Because he's in love.  I'm just tired.  Because he's a little bit in love.  Jim's a little in love.  No, just playing patty cakes is good. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Teaches you.  All right.  Now we're late.  See, we want to break early.  Now we're late.  Damn it.  See how this happens?  Go to break immediately.  Break, break, break.  Break it.  We're going to go to break.  Break.  Break, walk, break.  And then when we get back, you've got to do the radio tease.  When we get back, we'll talk about the full page that we got in the Daily News today.  Yes.  This happened over at XM, but we'll explain next.  They're in, they're in, I think they're, oh, that's Best Of? 
[00:19:30]  Best Of.  They even do a Best Of on MSNBC.  Can we still get his clips?  Sure.  Yeah, let's get his clips, even though I'm in Best Of, because one of our pals.  I'm in the Hamptons.  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, huh?  No.  Out on my ranch?  No, but Rob doing the Brian Wilson character is wearing our Opie and Anthony T-shirt, and  he's all over MSNBC this morning as part of the Best Of, I'm in.  Maybe that's not Best Of.  Maybe the weather and stuff is live.  Yeah, it just might be. 
[00:20:00]  I'll call Rob, my friend.  I don't know.  That low-pressure system didn't look familiar.  I've actually seen that before.  Have you?  Yeah.  Yeah, same clouds.  All right, here we go.  Listen, when we get back, we talk about the full page we got in the New York Daily News.  It concerns Howard Stern.  And we called him out.  We dared him. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, my God.  It's going to be a long day.  I think we all get nuts just before we have to hit the road.  It's the ONA virus spreading the art of the topless across America with the art of the topless. 
[00:21:00]  It's moronic.  I gots the cheddar.  I could pay to rank.  Four, three, two.  All right.  Hey, a black guy.  Ooh, fun.  Call me daddy.  I'm your cheddar man.  All right.

Still got the sleepies in my eyes.  And one of the first things I do every morning is I go to Google.  Oh, oh, oh, a computer.  All right.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  And instead, going to the old, waking up and going to the old laptop, 
[00:24:00]  I thought you meant, you know, doing something that maybe relaxes you for the rest of the day.  Because you made some hand motions, said you were going to the laptop.  I haven't.  I haven't.  All right.  I'm not opposed to wrecking myself every so often.  I haven't.  Especially when Jimmy looks over at me.  No, because the funny part was, you know, I understood what you meant,  but then you went into explanation more or less.  Yeah.  By the way, what I'm talking about, I saw his hands move. 
[00:24:30]  For those of you listening.  Yeah.  I haven't laptopped in a very long time.  I don't need to laptop anymore.  I never needed to.  I always wanted to.  No laptopping for me.  I was sent dates home early so I could laptop.  Leave the house.  This is the best I'm sorry to interrupt you.  When one thing bombs, when all three of us just jump on it and continue.  Please, good.  Help out a friend.  All right.  Here we go.  So I go to the laptop and I go to Google or Dogpile or Yahoo. 
[00:25:00]  It doesn't matter.  And I go, and I type in Opie and Anthony and I hit news.  And then you see what comes up.  Yeah.  You got to see if we made any of the local or other states run news.  It's like Christmas every morning.  You don't know what you're going to get.  You never know at this show.  So if you even have to bother getting up and going to work.  Yeah.  Sometimes you Google and you go, oh, no, that's going to cause a problem.  Good.  I could sleep in today.  Oh, that'll be many, many hours of meetings later today. 
[00:25:30]  So what I'm getting at is the – actually, I went to YouTube and the fan sites as well.  And I discovered that there was an attack on the media last night.  A good old-fashioned Opie and Anthony attack on the media.  These haven't happened in quite some time.  Well, because we got in a lot of trouble.  A lot of trouble.  We had another, another brilliant, brilliant promotion that we started.  Way to get our name out there. 
[00:26:00]  And once again, we took it too far and got in trouble.  Always happens.  For the new listeners who think that we've learned our lesson, ah-ah.  Yeah.  We just now do different things that get us in trouble.  We see something like good and we take it to the umpteenth limit until it becomes detrimental to the program.  Yeah.  I don't know what happens to us.  We suck.  We just thought it would be really, really smart for the listeners to kind of get behind the reporters as they're doing their live stand-up shots for the news and yell our name and hold up signs and wear costumes and yell our names. 
[00:26:30]  You always see them.  They're usually back there just making a goofy face.  They're on the phone telling their friends, you see me on TV.  Yeah.  Or throwing up gang signs during some stories.  Yeah.  But we figured why not use that time and that real estate behind the reporter to promote the program.  So we asked the listeners maybe to go out there with a sign or something or just yell O&A. 
[00:27:00]  Just get our name out there.  But then it just continued because everyone felt they had to top the next guy and that's when we get into trouble.  The guy dressed in a gorilla suit or as a banana or as – remember that one?  Yeah.  And then the guy, another guy in a lion suit.  You make it sound like we're completely innocent here.  Well, we did kind of ask people to do that.  We put up prizes for the best one.  Yes, we did.  And then fought XM to get better prizes.  Yeah.  And then yelled at XM because the prizes weren't good enough.  And then told them, maybe gave suggestions. 
[00:27:30]  So then it got to a point where reporters were getting so frustrated.  They're cursing live on the air.  Getting fired.  And that poor reporter got fired.  Arthur Chan.  And then another female reporter was doing some stand-up shot in Times Square.  She just gave up her post live on TV.  And then our O&A passengers jumping up and down.  There was no filter.  Paul and somebody else just jumping up and down.  Because now they had the live TV shot for themselves.  And the reporter walked off the set.  Yeah.  And we had our listeners now getting even more aggressive and tapping the reporters on the shoulder as they're doing their live report. 
[00:28:00]  Asking for directions.  Excuse me, sir.  Right in the middle of his stand-up live report.  And then unfortunately it went to air horns and that's when we got in deep, deep trouble.  Yeah, we had suggested certain things.  And I guess somebody came up with the idea of an air horn.  Which would have been okay if it was well behind the reporter.  You know?  Yeah.  You know, kind of...  That would be a little distracting. 
[00:28:30]  And then yell O&A or something like that.  But this clown goes like right up to the reporter and hit the horn.  And allegedly, I...  You can't even see it in the clip because the camera goes off the guy.  You hear the horn.  But he said it was too close to his ear and stuff.  Of course he's going to say something like that.  The New Jersey governor made a statement.  Yeah.  The New Jersey governor had to call us idiots.  Oops.  Nothing beats Giuliani calling us stupid though.  Yeah, I love that clip.  Stupid.  They're stupid.  And we got in trouble and they told us to knock it off. 
[00:29:00]  But somebody, I guess last night, decided to pull one?  Yeah.  It was on the 11 o'clock news on CBS.  And no prompting from us.  We didn't say anything.  No.  This is purely on his own.  So here's the audio.  Icon Edison says 19,000 customers are without electricity.  Many of them in Queens.  CBS 2's Hazel Sanchez live in Woodside with more Hazel.  Dana, it really has been a rough night here in Queens. 
[00:29:30]  Going from about 865 customers...  O&A Party Rock.  That number now ringing.  O&A Party Rock.  That number now ringing.  That's why we come out on the streets.  Roger Dino.  And they cut to the taped piece, of course.  They always do.  You can hear her turn around and go, excuse me, sir.  O&A Party Rock.  Yeah, Party Rock.  She started singing it.  Just wanted to get it out.  So there's what happened last night. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, I thought this was the...  It's not the police video, is it?  Oh, no.  It's like cell phone video of Mel out drinking.  Mel Gibson.  Yeah, well, now that everyone has the video on their cell phones.  Yeah, they got video of Mel Gibson hammered before he got into his car.  He's been officially charged with DUI, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but none of the other felonious crimes he could have been charged with resisting.  Stuff like that. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  I just want to see the dashboard cam of the cop car.  Because you know that's out there.  And the audio.  It's out there somewhere.  Got to make it public.  Because I want to hear his little tirade.  All right, well, there you go.  The latest assault on the media.  I don't know.  Are we condoning this at this point?  Um, I don't believe we can either condone or, um...  Oh!  No, I think we can condone these. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah?  No, of course not.  I don't know.  You do what you have to.  Come on.  If you're a supporter of the show, we don't care what the hell you do.  Go ahead.  Well, just, uh...  No, we're going to get in trouble again.  And contrary to what this gentleman did, I mean, we appreciate your support and everything.  Could you please stay away from the CBS reporters?  Yeah, they're kind of on our side.  That's really going to put the kibash on this pretty quickly.  Yeah, they're on our side, so...  Yeah.  There you have it. 
[00:31:30]  One big happy family now, so...  Eh, whatever you want to do.  Have fun.  I don't care.  All right, so that...  I don't care.  That happened overnight, and then we Google our names, and we get to the full-page story  on Opie and Anthony in the New York Daily News.  You want to explain this, Anthony?  It happened on XM, actually.  We got some audio of Howard Stern, and Howard was just casually saying that he could block  our appearance on David Letterman on August 31st. 
[00:32:00]  We're going to be on David Letterman.  The whole conversation started with someone sent a clip over to us, and the whole thing  started with him talking about how he got into Chicago and San Francisco, and he bashes  us a little bit.  He's been doing that recently.  So we respond in kind.  And then he started talking about, we're supposed to be on David Letterman.  We're doing David Letterman on August 31st.  Thank you.  Tune in.  And Howard was on his show saying that he could block that appearance. 
[00:32:30]  He goes, he got a call.  First, he says, I got a call from Letterman.  Well, Letterman's people.  My agent got a call from someone at Letterman.  Like, it just, it kept getting different, the story.  And then he said, yeah, someone called him, and he said, if I put my foot down, I could stop  that, that they wouldn't be able to appear on Letterman. 
[00:33:00]  And he's pulled crap like this for years.  You know, it's part of what Howard does and who he is.  It's a way to make himself bigger than life.  And we all know it.  Please.  I'm not telling anyone anything new here.  But no one ever calls him out on these things.  He comes up with these Howard factoids that are never confirmed.  If he says it, apparently it's law.  So when he said he could get us booted off of our Letterman appearance due to his relationship  with Dave or something, he was never specific as to who he spoke to, what powers that are 
[00:33:30]  at CBS that he still has any juice with after lawsuits and everything else.  I don't know who.  But he said he could put his foot down and have us taken off the show.  That's right.  Here's the actual clip.  We should play it again, okay?  Yes, we should.  This is Howard from his show that a tenth of his listeners get to hear.  A tenth of his old listeners.  Ross told me over the weekend that Opie and Anthony were going to be on Letterman at the  end of August. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, really?  And he asked me how I felt about it.  I said, who gives a s***?  And he said, really?  I said, yeah, I could have stopped that.  Letterman called me about three weeks ago.  The Letterman people called my agent and said they were getting a lot of pressure by a  certain person over at CBS to put Opie and Anthony.  So this wasn't a Dave idea?  No.  No, Dave's not necessarily a fan, or maybe he is.  I don't know.  But they weren't into it.  They said they were receiving a lot of pressure.  But if I put my foot down, they wouldn't do it. 
[00:34:30]  So I said, I'm not going to do that.  I don't care.  Anybody who wants to go on Letterman.  Letterman is not my show.  And I don't control the Letterman show.  And I'm not looking to control the Letterman show.  Put on whoever you want.  They said, well, will you stop doing it then?  I go, no, I'm not going to stop.  I mean, you've had other disc jockeys on the Letterman show.  Go have whoever you want.  You've had Imus.  You've had Mad Dog Russo.  Mad Dog and Russo show.  Oh, really?  Who's that?  I don't know.  Gary told me that.  Mike and the Man.  I said, have whoever you want on. 
[00:35:00]  Don't concern yourself with me.  I really don't care.  He could put his foot down.  The whole thing isn't even the point that he goes, I don't care.  Because the more he says, I don't care, that means the more you care.  Yeah, that's just human nature.  It's not even the fact that he goes into this whole thing.  If he didn't care, he wouldn't have addressed it.  The big part of that was that right at the beginning, he says, I could put my foot down and stop that.  Regardless of what he says afterwards, I don't care who goes on there.  Well, no, go ahead. 
[00:35:30]  Go ahead.  It almost short sells the biggest point of what he said was that, oh, at any time I could just, you know, put my foot down and stop that.  But I choose not to.  And we got on the air and said, go ahead.  Do it.  We dare you.  Dare you to do it.  Defy you.  Go ahead.  Do it.  We're telling Howard today to block us from going on Letterman August 31st.  August 31st.  If you can put your foot down and stop our appearance on the David Letterman show August 31st, do it. 
[00:36:00]  Because no one ever calls you out on this crap.  And that's just what it is.  He's been BSing his listeners for many, many years, coming up with stuff.  And we're calling him out.  We're finally calling him out.  Yeah.  If you have the power to do it, we're saying do it.  Like Anthony said on our XM show, we're all in.  We're all in.  We'll take the chance.  We're all in.  We would love to be on Letterman.  Yeah.  And we're booked for Letterman August 31st.  But we say to you today, Howard, if you can stop that, we want to see you stop it. 
[00:36:30]  Do it.  Stop babbling.  Don't talk about it.  Don't say that you don't care, that you don't want to control the show.  You started the whole thing off by saying you could put your foot down and put a stop to it.  So we say do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Put your foot down.  We're all in.  We're going all in.  You're going to call or you're going to fold.  That's what the deal is.  And if by chance he can actually do it, more power to you.  You have a lot more juice than I thought you did. 
[00:37:00]  But this is just another one of his rants of crap that people just buy because he said it.  That's it.  Go ahead.  Please.  Please do it.  Let's see.  Prove to everybody that you can really do it.  Go ahead.  Show us a little piece of the old Howard that did have that juice, that did have the passion,  that could battle other radio people and would do something like this. 
[00:37:30]  Go ahead.  Do it.  We're saying do it.  So we really went off on our XM show.  We're a little calmer now.  We had a lot of fun with this yesterday.  And the Daily News picked up on it.  Well, actually, we called them.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We alerted the media.  It made it to allaccess.com.  Orbitcast.com picked up the story and actually has the audio from yesterday's show if you want to check it out for yourself. 
[00:38:00]  Orbitcast.com has the story.  By the way, for any stern zombies that just unquestionably believe everything he says and like to call us up occasionally and go,  can't you just do a show without talking about Howard?  He brought us up.  This is our response to him bringing us up on his show and saying that he could keep us off Letterman.  And unlike other jocks that he's crushed in his heyday, we don't just sit around and eat it. 
[00:38:30]  But we give it back.  And our response to this is do it.  Do it.  Please.  Put that foot down.  Go ahead.  Put your big foot down and keep us off Letterman.  If you're able to do it, we want to say it.  Your fans would love to say it.  You'd be huge.  You get Howard.  Howard's fans would eat it up.  It would be huge.  Do it. 
[00:39:00]  And we'll see you on Letterman on the 31st, by the way.  So we had a lot of fun yesterday.  The Daily News picked up on it.  There's a whole page on it in the TV section.  Richard Huff, you know, he knows a good story when he sees one, especially if we call him personally.  At least we're honest.  News whores that we are.  And John Minnelli from The Post, he's a friend of ours.  But he's too busy writing about how Air America is going to be on some very obscure radio station in New York soon.  So thanks.  Thanks for helping us out yesterday, John. 
[00:39:30]  Maybe they wouldn't let him.  The Post hates us.  Yeah, I know.  I know The Post hates us.  I think he's in a tough spot.  But, you know, whatever.  We've got to do what we've got to do.  So the New York Daily News from Richard Huff.  Double dare for Howard from Opie and Anthony.  Radio morning show host Opie and Anthony yesterday escalated a verbal attack.  Some might say publicity stunt against Howard Stern by daring him to get them kicked off CBS Late Show with David Letterman.  Monday on his serious satellite show, Stern said he had a chance to stop Opie and Anthony, who are heard on Free FM in New York and on XM Satellite Radio, from appearing on Letterman later this month. 
[00:40:00]  But he didn't do that.  Stern said he got a call from someone at Letterman's show three weeks ago and suggested if he wanted, they wouldn't be booked.  He said he didn't care and would continue to go on Letterman, whether ONA did or not.  Whether that's true or not, we don't know for sure.  But because Howard had to mention this on his show, that's why we're calling him out.  If you have that power, we say do it.  Do it.  Show us what kind of power you have, Howard.  Do it.  We're all in.  Howard. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  However, Opie, Greg Hughes, and Anthony, Kumia yesterday challenged Stern to actually stop their appearance.  Howard does this all the time, Kumia said.  He says things that can never be confirmed.  There's no accountability.  We are telling Howard, go ahead, put his foot down.  If he can get us taken off Letterman, do it.  We dare you, Hughes added.  He's so full of crap.  And then the article goes on and on.  On and on.  Other feuds and this and that.  So you can read it for yourself.  It's the New York Daily News.  Yeah.  But we had a lot of fun with that yesterday. 
[00:41:00]  And if you want to hear the audio, it's on Orbitcast.com for your listening pleasure.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  All right.  We should take a break.  We got Patrice O'Neal joining the program.  We got other things to get into.  We got Mondo Topless Part 2.  We got, actually, do we have time to play Brian Wilson doing the weather on Imus?  We were talking about this, too.  We're trying to get rid of a bunch of things.  Imus is on break, I guess.  I think he's taking the week off or something.  So they're in best of mode.  And on MSNBC, we saw Rob Bartlett doing his Brian Wilson character wearing an Opie and 
[00:41:30]  Anthony T-shirt doing the weather.  So we got very distracted and we got the audio.  Does he mention us in this clip?  I think he does, right?  I think he says ONA Party Rock.  ONA Party Rock or something.  So we're all over the place today.  This is from MSNBC.  Now, as regular viewers know, on the Imus in the Morning program, you never quite know  what's going to happen next.  And sometimes you just have to go with the flow because if you don't, you are dead. 
[00:42:00]  That was true for Jeff Ranieri, NBC Weather Plus meteorologist, who got, well, a little  surprised as he was giving Imus his report.  Let's go to Jeff Ranieri now.  Is it Ranieri?  What is it, Jeff?  Ranieri.  What's going on with the hurricane?  Well, it's lost a little bit of strength here with winds at 145 miles per hour, but still  a very, very strong storm gusting to 173 in the center.  And you can see it's just to the south of the Yucatan Peninsula.  So we are expecting Cozmel and Cancun to get the worst of the storm system today. 
[00:42:30]  How am I supposed to keep continuing with this?  Let's send him down.  Let's send him down to Cozmel and Cancun.  Cozmel and Cancun.  Hey, buddy, well, I'll catch that joke, too.  Oh, go ahead, Jeff. 
[00:43:00]  With him back here?  Let's try it.  All right.  Let's try it.  What is this thing supposed to happen?  I can't keep up with this.  You're not even going to get me under the umbrella?  Oh, you've got to do the weather.  All right.  I'm not used to this happening, so.  When is it supposed to hit land or any land?  It might be more visual, huh? 
[00:43:30]  Sometimes Thursday into Friday.  Right.  And then Southwest Florida into Sunday and Monday.  Six to eight-month-old weather forecast.  Yeah, basically, he's in the background with the Opie and Anthony t-shirt on.  Yeah.  That's Brian Wilson, just making a fool of himself.  And a big umbrella on the weather set.  Well, this bombed horribly.  Yeah.  Visually, it was fun to watch.  It's great to see Bartlett, too.  Oh, he's constantly on now because of his character.  It's like, you didn't hear what I missed for a while.  I know he's on our everything.  Yeah, Rob Bartlett's really funny. 
[00:44:00]  Brian Wilson doing anything except music is never good.  Poor Jeffrey Neary.  What a good sport.  A good sport.  They're not all going to be winners.  That is more of a visual.  That's one of those.  Oh, all right.  Now I feel better.  Me, too.  By the way, have that whole segment of us just listening to that audio.  Ready for us to goof on as if it was another show.  Yeah, because that was just.  Because that's perfect.  That was just awful. 
[00:44:30]  And I'm distracted because I just found out that BCN, as we're calling out Howard.  Yeah.  The signal craps out.  And it goes to music.  Oh, great.  What is he, still control BCN or something?  Basically, Howard said he could stop us from going on Letterman on August 31st.  And we say to Howard, just in case BCN and the Boston listeners didn't hear this.  We say to Howard today, do it.  We're all in.  Go ahead.  We dare you.  You don't have that power and you're just talking out your ass. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Let's take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  What is this?  What is this?  All right.  What's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good because I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks. 
[00:45:30]  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yep.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  What road against the wall?  I'm not going to have a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks.  Call him.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism. 
[00:46:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  La la la.  La la la la la.  La la la la la.  La la la la la.  Love it.  Ooh, listen to this.  Cranking up.  That's Jimmy on drums, by the way.  Poo Fighter.  Yeah.  Jimmy Norton.  Our own Jimmy Norton plays drums with the Poo Fighters.  For those of you in the new market.  Dave Roll?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:46:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Mondo Topless Part 2.  Yes.  I want to explain for people maybe that are just tuning in.  Mondo Topless.  This is some, what they used to call kind of porn.  Back in the late 60s, early 70s, Russ Meyer put out a lot of these movies.  Vixens.  Super Vixens.  Revenge of the Super Vixens.  Anything with big-breasted women.  That's what he did.  And this one is called Mondo Topless. 
[00:47:00]  It's one of his earlier features.  And it's just pretty much rock music of the day.  Not even of the day.  It's kind of like homespun.  Are there any songs you recognize in this?  No, no, no.  That generic, like when the Bradys would turn on their radio.  I love this song.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  Kind of like that.  And Topless Women.  And commentary that goes along with the Topless Women.  And then the women talking. 
[00:47:30]  The music was made for these features because back in the day, like, rock artists didn't understand the marking value of being in a movie.  Oh, they would never do that.  Being in a movie.  Yeah.  That only started, what, in the 80s maybe?  I don't even think the 80s.  I think it was still selling out.  Corporate 80s.  I think, like, 90s, early 90s is when now you hear a song that's a complete hit, getting the heaviest rotation possible on the radio, just out.  And it's already, you know, a caddy commercial for some other product.  Yeah.  Now it's not considered selling out. 
[00:48:00]  It's just part of the deal.  Right.  Scoop it up.  All right.  Well, yesterday we introduced a lot of people to Mondo Topless, this fine Russ Meyer film.  And today we allow some of the girls that are experienced with the art of the Topless.  Whatever that is.  The narrator had talked about girls experts in the art of the Topless.  The Topless.  You know, just to bring everyone up to speed, because we're gaining new listeners every day in Chicago. 
[00:48:30]  We have to be.  We gotta be.  I think we're up to 100 listeners in Chicago, so what's up, Chicago?  We doubled the ratings already?  I think so.  Wow.  Here's Russ Meyer.  Actually, the guy who does the voices.  Yeah, Russ would narrate these, and then some other guy would do the voiceover.  He would take Russ's voice and just dub over it.  That's what we found out yesterday.  You'll learn a little something here.  I failed everyone. 
[00:49:00]  What happened?  No.  Because I take pride in knowing music, and people like to write about the fact that I know music and stuff on the fan sites.  Yeah.  That was Yellow Card.  Oh.  And not the Foo Fighters.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  That has to hurt.  It does hurt.  Because I do pride myself on knowing music. 
[00:49:30]  I don't.  Wow.  Wow.  How did I F that one up?  Yeah, especially since you chose it and played it.  I like how people can't just correct you.  It's got to be, that's Yellow Card, faggot.  I know.  I know.  Sorry.  Okay.  Yellow Card, Anthony, they suck, and so do you.  Yeah.  For not knowing.  Yeah, calm down, man.  I didn't say it either.  Jesus.  At least we're acknowledging we were wrong.  Help me out here, Hendry.  You know that most of the people listening just assumed that it was Foo Fighters because 
[00:50:00]  we said it was the Foo Fighters because we got microphones in front of us and that makes  us experts?  Once you have a mic in front of you, you're an expert.  We could have got away with it, faggots.  But instead, we called ourselves out.  I could have put my foot down and kept them from getting a record deal in the first place.  Chose not to.  I'm sorry.  Accept my apology, please.  And I try to throw out my knowledge by mentioning Dave Grohl's name just so people wouldn't think  that I'm billboard-centric.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here's some more audio.  Well, we played these two clips yesterday just to get everyone up to speed. 
[00:50:30]  And then finally, we'll have the girls speak, okay?  The Art of the Topless from Mondo Topless.  San Francisco, a Spamoni-like hodgepodge of wild architecture harboring wonderful old  world restaurants and emporiums of pleasure, exploding from dust to dawn with the way-out  craze of the topless, born and nurtured by staid and stolid San Francisco, and cut loose  to rampage across the USA and even Europe. 
[00:51:00]  National publications such as Life, Playboy, and Esquire have documented the topless.  The phrase and the craze that is changing the mood and the mores of people everywhere.  Why didn't that catch on?  The Art of the Topless.  The way-out craze of the topless.  Of the topless.  The topless.  That is just a fantastic thing.  The topless.  Has someone taken that name on the fan sites?  They had to.  They had to, right? 
[00:51:30]  I haven't checked.  I'm sure if the coveted the topless.  The topless.  The Art of the topless.  Here's another clip from yesterday.  Mondo topless captures the basic quintessence of the movement.  With movement.  Way out.  Wild movement.  Here, go-go girls, in and out of their environment, will be revealed to you in scenes that can  only be summarized as a swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Mondo topless is believably real in Eastman color. 
[00:52:00]  But unbelievable just barely describes all of Russ Meyer's discotheque discoveries.  Fantastic women.  Fantastic dances.  Featuring the world's loveliest books addicts.  You've only dreamed there were women like these until now.  But they're real.  Unbelievably real in Mondo topless.  That's a guy's voice that would, like, if nuclear missiles were headed your way, that's 
[00:52:30]  how his delivery should be.  Oh, my God, people.  Nuclear missiles headed towards our cities.  But he's talking about the topless.  The topless.  The topless.  The art of the topless.  Wake up, whoopie.  I like that.  Brings it all back together.  Yeah.  Holla.  Holla.  What did he say to something about, girl?  You got a girl?  That's right, girl.  That's right, girl.  You go, girl? 
[00:53:00]  No, it wasn't quite that bad.  No.  He's headed in that direction.  He certainly is.  Before we hear from the girls from Mondo topless, one more clip.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Revving up on runway number one is Bumptuous Pat Baringer, a magnificently configured female  skilled in the art of the topless.  I beg you to try to listen to what she has to say.  She's so good in the art of the topless and so buxotic that he defies you to even listen 
[00:53:30]  to a word coming out of her stupid mouth.  He begs you to try to register one word this dumb bitch is saying while they're swinging  in front of your face.  Of course.  As she just is in the art of the topless, in the moment.  Wonderful.  Pat Baringer.  What a great stripper name.  Pat Baringer. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  Oh, that's an awful name.  Come on, guys.  Put it together.  Here's Pat Baringer.  That's the girl at the office.  The new girl.  The new temp.  This is Pat Baringer.  She's going to be sitting in for a while.  That's the name of a tight end in like 1965.  Taking the field, Pat Baringer.  John Madden and Pat Baringer.  In the booth, I'm here with Pat Baringer.  Right.  Now, you were skilled in the art of the topless.  That's right, Pat. 
[00:54:30]  Damn it.  They suck.  Let's listen to Pat Baringer.  Make me feel better.  No, it's all right.  I think I might have to play that palaver clip again.  I think it's part of the Pat Baringer dialogue.  That's fine.  You never get enough of it.  By the way, hands are sad.  Huh?  Yeah, I need something to bring me up.  I screwed up that joke.  No mistake.  All right.  Here we go.  Reving up on runway number one is punctuous Pat Baringer,  a magnificently configured female skilled in the art of the topless. 
[00:55:00]  I beg you to try to listen to what she has to say.  All that you're doing is a dance.  It has no meaning whatsoever.  There are gyrations and so on, suggestive movements,  but still it is entertainment,  and there is no other meaning other than a dance.  What'd she say?  She's just...  I couldn't hear a word.  I tried to listen.  I was paying attention to the art of the topless.  I took his advice.  He's right.  I have no idea what she said. 
[00:55:30]  Pat Baringer is an idiot.  Wake up with Pat Baringer.  Thank you, Bill, from Waterford.  Welcome back to the Pat Baringer and Anthony show.  La, la, la, la, la.  The art of the topless.  I want to smack Pat Baringer,  even though she's probably a grandma in diapers by now.  I'd love nothing more than to not only not listen to her,  but to blacken her eye.  Let's listen to the next fine...  The art of my fist.  Let's listen to the next fine female here. 
[00:56:00]  Ready to entertain you as buxotic Darlene Gray,  England's answer to the biggest and the best.  What do you say, Darlene?  No, I don't wear a brassiere to bed.  That was it?  I don't wear a brassiere to bed.  A brassiere to bed.  And, you know, it's just one of those missile cone, nose cone bras.  I don't wear a brassiere to bed.  Wow, outrageous in the art of the topless.  What was her name? 
[00:56:30]  Diane Gray?  Darlene Gray.  Darlene Gray.  That's all she's got.  That's also an awful name for a stripper.  Darlene Gray.  G-R-E-Y because she's from London.  Yeah.  I think we've given women too much power.  Wow.  This is how it used to be.  That was shocking back then.  Right.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  She doesn't wear a bra to bed.  You're lucky we don't just keep you chained in the basement for procreation, you dopes.  Where else are you going to hear this? 
[00:57:00]  You want to hear from Luscious Sin?  Luscious Sin.  And away we go with Luscious Sin, Lene.  Svelte and lindsome.  Give us a word, sin.  I can be around anything green and have a feeling of sensation run through my body only  because it is a feeling of nature.  It is a feeling of freedom.  She loves the color green.  How about snot?  Yeah.  How do you feel about a booger?  Wow, these are just hippie broads. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  That are so doped up.  I remember her now from Mondo Topless.  She's the one that just did the art of the topless in the middle of the woods.  Yeah.  Dancing and running around.  She was the nature one.  Yeah.  All you can hope for is a nice evil dead moment with a tree branch.  So that's Luscious Sin.  She loves the color green.  Holy s***.  These girls have nothing to say.  But they are experts and the art of the topless.  Well, Cigars and Scotch, they're coming in like crazy now. 
[00:58:00]  Are we allowed to say Whack Bag at this point?  Yeah.  One of our fine fan sites?  Yes.  Uh, he writes, Jim Norton, the art of the chinwess.  Oh, God.  Let's hear a word, Jimmy.  I would play football, but the helmet would always fall off because there was nothing to strap it onto.  You guys want to hear from Darla Paris?  Of course.  All right.  Try to follow delicious Darla Paris, vivaciously voluptuous, Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea. 
[00:58:30]  And the last time I measured, it was 30, 60.  That's outrageous back then.  Yep.  This is what people used to go to theaters for, too.  There was no video tape.  There was no DVD on demand.  None of that to just sit in the comfort of your own home.  You used to have to go to a theater and share it with perverts that were actually getting off to this garbage. 
[00:59:00]  And then spatula your shoes on your way home.  You ready for this?  That's Buxotic Boston Tom writes from Framingham.  Wake up with the topless.  The topless.  And Steven from Bayshore, he writes some great stuff every morning.  Do you have any clips from Mondo Whoopi?  She knows the art of the jokless.  An expert in the art of the jokless. 
[00:59:30]  That was Darla Paris, huh?  We move on with.  Love these names.  We move on with.  Diane Young.  It's also another one.  It's just an awful stripper name.  Diane Young.  How unsexy is that?  Settle back and let yummy Diane Young entertain you.  Blondly beautiful.  And while you're about it, lend her your ear.  I used to play a cello in a symphony orchestra when I was 13. 
[01:00:00]  You gotta be kidding me.  This is one of my favorite movies to just show people when they come over, man.  And it just has that 60s look and it's all groovy and they're topless, talking about, babbling  about nothing.  Yeah.  She probably talked for a half hour or 40 minutes and that's the only clip they could  take.  Yeah.  This dope talk.  She played cello when she was 13.  The rest of it was probably just begging for acid or something. 
[01:00:30]  You know, please, please.  Just, I need acid.  Please.  She probably tried to make political statements about the war in Vietnam and they were just  like, all right, shut up, stupid, and say something we can make you look foolish with.  All right.  Want to hear from Donna X?  Yeah, it's a mysterious name.  All right.  Oh, the dance.  What happened?  Diane goes, she's literally doing the monkey in the clip. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  The dance?  Yeah.  You know, you should just swing your arms around and do the monkey.  Yeah.  She was doing that.  It's so not hot.  I used to play the cello.  Did ya?  Dan, you got to bring this home over the weekend and get us Mondo Topless Part 3 for  Monday or Tuesday.  Okay.  All right?  Yep.  There's way, there's so much more to get to with this Mondo Topless.  We've just scratched the surface.  Here's Donna X.  Relax and enjoy exciting Donna X. 
[01:01:30]  Juno-esque of proportion.  Listen closely to what she has to say about Topless.  Oh, I think everybody goes by moods.  You might make it every night a steady thing for a month, and then you might lay off for  a whole complete week and really not even need it at all.  It depends on your mental attitude.  The Topless she's talking about?  Not being topless?  Not being topless, sir.  The Topless.  Right.  I think she's, this goes, you might go with the Topless for a while. 
[01:02:00]  I have no idea what these idiots are babbling about.  The mental attitude.  She can't help herself?  She has to do the Topless?  Is that what we're going to do in that clip?  Yep.  Wow.  I actually want to buy this film now on DVD.  This is great.  Oh, it's wonderful.  All right.  We got six more clips to play after the break.  Thank God.  We'll split it up a little bit.  Let's find out.  Instead of rushing through it.  Huh?  Let's find out if this announcer's still alive.  We got to find out more about the announcer.  Doug Stanhope was making more sense yesterday. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  On the show, on Acid, Xanax, and Jägermeister.  Xanadu's.  Xanadu's.  He was drinking Xanadu's.  What a junkie Doug is.  Great call yesterday.  I knew he was a psycho in Vail in 95 when we did the festival.  We shared a room.  And he slept with all his possessions on the bed.  Vovacious Doug Stanhope.  Drug addict.  Psychopath.  All the possessions on the bed.  In case it got blown out the window.  The Wizard of Oz thing.  All the possessions would be there. 
[01:03:00]  And an expert in the dignity list.  Doug's a goose.  All right.  You know what?  We could play something else before we go to break here.  What?  What?  Jim's new bit.  That we.  That Jimmy did on the other side of the Opie and Anthony show.  We want to bring it over here today.  It's Jim being interrupted.  We were talking to a sleep expert.  It was a bad guest day.  It was bad guest day.  Say no more.  Say no more. 
[01:03:30]  And so this guy's babbling away.  And Jim decided to try out his new character.  Jim being interrupted.  Which just kind of came at that moment.  Yes.  Came into me.  It just pops right into you.  We just got some, you know, a quick taste here.  Listen to this.  This is informing a lot of people about a very serious problem that I don't think they look  at as serious.  Because as growing up, a lot of cartoons and shows have shown snoring as something humorous  and funny, and it's a very serious problem.  Okay.  Can we explain something first?  Like, you know, Reggie out. 
[01:04:00]  Huh?  Because I don't want to look like a complete idiot to the nation.  One person in this collection of dopes that we call the Opie and Anthony show has to hold  the guest on the line.  That has turned into my job.  We all have roles here.  Opie, the complete a-hole to the guest.  Doesn't care what he says.  Curses them out.  Calls them idiots.  Calls them jackass.  Curses at them.  I have to then try to reel them back in and keep them on the line.  Jimmy then throws in his comedic genius to make everybody laugh. 
[01:04:30]  So when you hear me actually legitimately talking to a stupid guest about sleep apnea,  that's my job.  It's my job.  You don't give a crap.  I could care less, but I have to keep the fish on the hook.  He'll always mumble, like, while they're talking, the guy will be saying something,  and he'll just go, boring.  And the guy will, like, finish, and that's what that was.  It's so embarrassing, and I try to get louder with my questioning as Opie's insulting them. 
[01:05:00]  It's the hardest game to play.  But he knows he heard it, and yet he didn't.  Yeah, what?  Guy couldn't have possibly just said boring to me.  Why would he?  I'm in the middle of talking.  I got a surprise today.  What?  So that's what Anthony wanted to explain with this clip, right?  Yes, yes, please.  Okay, so let's go back to the clip.  And shows have shown snoring as something humorous and funny, and it's a very serious problem.  It can't be a serious problem.  Like, you know, Reggie...  And now there's a solution.  I was saying something. 
[01:05:30]  Jimmy?  Reggie White, uh...  Yeah.  Reggie White died of it, right?  Wow.  He died of, um...  I was saying that!  Jimmy!  Sleep after you.  Wow.  Be nice to our guest, Jimmy.  No, no, I am, but I'm trying to say something.  I'm trying...  Forget it, I won't talk.  Good.  All right, that was the start of it.  That was the start.  That's how it began.  Okay, here's the second clip.  Then Jimmy gets more proficient at baiting him.  He realizes it's a good bit.  Yeah, he realizes how the bit works. 
[01:06:00]  I was having some difficulty sleeping.  Right.  And, um, you know...  It depends.  I'm not finished!  You have to evaluate the patient.  Surgery like that is indicated in a certain instance, but not in everybody.  Basically, it makes me...  I'm not done yet!  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  ...the openings between the sinuses and the nose larger.  The air enters the sinus cavity, and the secretion is exited.  What are you doing in my house?  No, he's asking, do you make house calls? 
[01:06:30]  Oh, in your house?  No, not usually.  How long would it...  We have equipment...  I was trying to ask you something!  Okay.  Okay.  You are a pro in the art of the a-hole.  Uh, you want to hear more?  Yeah, I'm turning into the Pat Barron's group interviews.  Wow.  Here we go.  Are there certain foods that are more likely to cause, um...  Like, I have a very bad thing in the back of my throat where I'm always going, 
[01:07:00]  and I always have to clear my throat.  Is that tied in with my nasal drip?  Like, I take Mucinex a lot.  Yes.  Especially dairy products make that worse.  All right, you go ahead.  I wasn't done, but go ahead.  Yeah, dairy products will make the saliva thicker, and give you more of a problem like that.  A lot of times...  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt my question.  A lot of times I'll have coffee, and, like, I'm fine, and yet I'll have a cup of coffee,  and the next thing you know, I've got to take, like, two Mucinex, 
[01:07:30]  so I'm not, like, clearing my throat every ten seconds.  Yeah, do you have cream in the coffee?  What's that?  You've got to jump right in.  Do you have cream in the coffee?  No, I don't.  I have fat-free or lactate.  Yeah, well, that'll do it, too.  All right, well, will it?  But it really is, like, a problem for me.  I always have a feeling I've got this, like, thin trail of booger spit in the back of my throat.  It drives me...  But let me tell you something.  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry, I didn't mean to ask the question.  Let me tell you something.  You're right.  You would know.  You're the doctor.  All right.  You're making fun of it, but mucus is good.  We can't live without mucus.  No, I didn't say let's remove all mucus like it's in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1941. 
[01:08:00]  I was simply saying, how do I stop clearing my throat all the time?  Well...  I don't really know what to do about it.  It's driving me nuts.  Mm-hmm.  And I'll take, like, Mucinex, which does clear it up.  But I notice I have to take more and more and more, and I'm not sure.  It drives me crazy.  And I think it's tied into the fact that I have bad sinuses.  Do you drink a lot of water?  I do, actually.  I drink probably more water than is good for me.  That's what people have been telling me my whole life.  I'm in the bathroom a lot, which I thought meant diabetes, but it turns out that it's just that I drink a lot of water. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, right.  And I'm not too sure if that helped.  It does help a little bit.  It does help.  But I like that.  Oh, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to just talk to you.  All right, go ahead.  Now, how do you diagnose me if we're both talking?  We are the biggest a-holes.  That is so goddamn funny.  I can't even tell you, Jimmy.  A lot of that babble is I have to bait him into actually talking like I'm done.  But you're not done.  A lot of times he wouldn't talk.  So I have to continue it like the real person. 
[01:09:00]  All right, you go ahead.  No, you would not.  All that comes from my friend Rob Cullen.  And then one day in front of that stupid gym outside smoking, yeah, it gets this hot in L.A.  Well, no, I heard it.  All right, you would know.  Just shut me up immediately.  And then Frank the Frowner makes an appearance during the interview.  Yes.  Here's Frank the Frowner, doctor.  Doctor?  Yes?  I have a problem with my lips.  I said I always look like I'm frowning.  No matter how happy I am on the inside. 
[01:09:30]  You're sorry?  No!  Pay attention to me.  I said I always look like I'm frowning.  Frowning.  Regardless of how happy I am on the inside.  And I was wondering if there was anything that could be done to my facial tissue.  Well, you know, it's muscles to frown that does to smile.  I was once told by an older Negro who was forcing himself down my throat.  Now, doctor, is that true?  We've heard that for years that it takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile. 
[01:10:00]  Is this just an urban myth?  Is that true or is it a misnomer?  Yes.  Because I've always wondered.  It does.  Yeah.  How many muscles does it take?  32.  To do what?  You're not clarifying.  You're just yelling numbers.  All right, Frank.  All right, calm down a little bit.  Please don't be mean to our guest.  Well, that's another aspect of the movement.  The ability to have facial expression.  That's the problem.  My mother, I have fetal alcohol syndrome. 
[01:10:30]  She drank a lot, and my father practiced judo on her belly.  I don't know.  I don't know how you do it.  Oh, it's so embarrassing just to be in the same room when you're doing that.  And I have to then justify why you're asking about the muscles for the smile.  Doctor, is it?  Does it take?  Like, I care again.  I felt him wiggling off the hook. 
[01:11:00]  I had to tighten it up.  Smart fish.  He's gone under the boat.  That's me.  I'm Quint all strapped in while you idiots are trying to cut my line.  Thanks, Hooper.  You're an idiot, Mr. Norton.  You get silly hands from playing Whoopi Clips all your life.  Welcome, Whoopi.  Talking about hooking any bluegills or tommy cats.  Talking about sharking. 
[01:11:30]  Talking about working for a living.  Talking about Pat Barringer.  Pat Barringer.  I defy you to listen to her.  Talking about the art of the topless.  We'll do more the art of the topless.  Pat Barringer swims up to you.  Eyes rolled back white.  Lifeless eyes like a doll's eyes.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Yes, please.  Is Patrice O'Neil here?  Where is he?  He's on his way.  Where is he?  I saw Patrice eat a rocking chair once. 
[01:12:00]  Patrice will be joining the program next.  Where is he?  I don't know.  More Mondo topless clips on the way.  More Mondo topless.  Also, we got to talk about your cell phones today.  Is he here?  We got to talk about the Mel Gibson, the latest on him.  And, of course, we got to get Muslim Fun Day canceled in England.  Why?  Probably too many people showed up.  Too much fun in Islam.  That's just a shame.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hit it. 
[01:12:30]  I don't have kids.  I want porno.  I want porno on my TV.  I want violent video games.  I want violence on TV.  I don't want to take it off because you had kids.  All you people with your children make me effing sick.  We're psychotic.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  O.P. & Anthony.  The O.P. & Anthony Show.  We're back, back in the New York room 
[01:13:00]  We're back, back in the New York room  Welcome back to the OVN Anthony Show  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Yeah! 
[01:13:30]  What about that?  That!  Wow, that's very reminiscent of the old Tonight Show orchestra.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doc Severinson.  Doc Severinson, right.  Yeah, we can't get enough of that.  It's the OVN Anthony Show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  After today's show, we're heading to Boston.  We're broadcasting live from BCN tomorrow morning.  We're going to have, I think, at least 100 pairs of tickets to the O&A Traveling Virus  that happened Saturday at the DCU Center in Worcester, Mass. 
[01:14:00]  And also the lawn tickets for the Camden, which is the Philly market, open up tomorrow, I think, or Friday.  Friday.  What's today?  I don't know.  Today's Thursday.  Tomorrow morning, you can get the Camden lawn tickets finally open because the other part has been sold out.  Yeah, but the key to the lawn seats for the Philly show, or the Philly area show, we should call it,  because Camden is officially in Jersey, lawn seats only $10 for the weekend.  You get your lawn seats over the weekend for the Philly show, it's only going to cost you $10. 
[01:14:30]  After that, the lawn seats will cost you $20.  What happens in between that time that makes it more valuable?  It's like promotion.  I don't even know.  It's a collector's item.  I love that.  It's like, if you buy now.  We're just trying to save our listeners some money.  Of course we are.  We're good guys.  We're trying, at least.  And don't forget the O&A traveling virus, presented by Bud Light.  Patrice O'Neill, late.  Patrice.  Is he?  Patrice is late. 
[01:15:00]  He's sleeping.  He did this to us once before.  He sleeps.  He likes to sleep.  Is Patrice O'Neill here yet?  He's on his way.  You guys said that a half hour ago.  Exactly.  What is it about melanin that equals punctuality?  I walked past the green room.  I forgot all about this, but Big A is here today.  Oof.  Solo.  Oh, no.  Louis Twitchell Santani?  Louis Twitchell Santani.  Big A will be reading the top news stories for the new cities. 
[01:15:30]  Stick around.  Wow.  He's a babbling ass.  Is Louis Twitchell Santani turning into the other guy from Wham?  Louis Twitchell Santani?  Is that it?  I don't know.  Is he Oates?  I don't know.  He's going to do, like, four news stories.  And then we got an idea.  Everyone bring their money today?  You didn't bring your money today.  I left like I was fleeing in the night when I left the house. 
[01:16:00]  Look, no watch.  I left without my watch.  Me too.  Give me the watch.  So you have no money?  I'll be damned.  I'm going to let some...  I don't know that line very well.  Watched it only a million times.  Suicide Kings?  Nah.  Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction.  What was this?  I'll be damned.  I let some greasy slope put his dirty yellow fingers on it.  This watch was in my...  Remember that?  Yeah, I do remember that.  It's a great scene.  I just got the wrong movie.  I'm an idiot. 
[01:16:30]  Pulp Fiction.  But I forgot my watch and I forgot my money.  I'm broke.  I'm broke.  So don't try to rob me when I leave.  I have no money.  No, we're going to have to lend you money so you can do what we want to do today.  Big A can't say ST words.  Yeah.  So we're going to bet how long it takes him to say some ST words.  And it's fun.  It's fun for you at home.  Play with your friends.  Make some money.  Play along.  So we're going to give him like ST words and then we decide how long it's going to take  him to say the ST word. 
[01:17:00]  Because we're convinced there's an ST word out there that'll shut him down forever.  That his brain will just explode.  Because we've seen his forehead get all crazy and he's struggling and he's concentrating.  He starts turning different colors.  He stops breathing sometimes.  Not long enough.  It's a sight to behold.  I got to tell you.  It really is.  He's a wreck.  So we'll be betting as he tries to say ST words today.  And some ST words harder than others depending on what letter comes after ST.  Right.  STR. 
[01:17:30]  STR is a little rough.  He really has a problem with.  A little rough.  STA.  Not that much of a problem.  I think if there's a vowel after it.  Right.  A constant.  Yeah.  All right.  But back to Mondo Topless.  The art of the topless.  We get to say hi to Babette Bardot.  Babette Bardot.  Hang on men and zero in on bouncy Babette Bardot.  French and Swedish.  50-50 where it counts. 
[01:18:00]  Speak to us Babette baby.  I try to project a childlike to a woman.  Quality.  Because I do believe that men they're not like so much odd sex.  They like softness also.  So I try to project both.  Sexuality and also gentleness.  So I do always start my act more or less in a very gentle way.  You know any one of these girls you'd have to foreplay would you'd need a machete. 
[01:18:30]  Because we all know what the style was back then.  Yeah.  Oh natural.  Yeah there you go.  So that's Babette Bardot.  I hate when they don't shave.  You don't like that.  It stinks.  It's coming back.  Not in my life it's not.  I can't.  I see one hair.  It's duct tape.  Whack.  Go by.  Absolutely.  Everything old is new again.  Yeah.  It's coming back around. 
[01:19:00]  It's back in style.  It's coming back around.  Eek.  No.  The hair is never coming back.  Get rid of it.  It's got to be well trimmed but I'm not offended by any hair.  It was here for 10,000 years.  Leave it for a little while.  How about that?  It was in for 10,000 years to be unshaven chimps.  How about giving us a break would you?  How about that?  Legs, armpits. 
[01:19:30]  Everything.  Just shave everything.  I don't mind hair on the armpits as much.  What?  Now that.  Now your argument out the window.  I'll tell you why.  Why?  I don't touch the armpits.  Yeah but you see it.  Who cares?  I'm saying if a woman's going to have hair anywhere if I had to choose.  I prefer she doesn't.  But that would be the least offensive to me because I don't.  Armpit hair is least offensive.  Compared to legs or everything else?  Yes.  Because I don't touch the armpits.  Oof.  Yeah but you got to look at the whole picture.  Aren't you a visual guy?  Very much but the armpits don't capture a lot of my attention. 
[01:20:00]  Oh my god.  It just would take me out of the game.  Yeah I don't want hair.  They would completely take me out of the game.  But your head's kind of up there during certain acts.  So it's during certain acts.  It's kind of up in that area of face to face, face to shoulder.  How would even go?  Things like that.  So if you see a little tuft coming out from under an armpit it's just going to be a turn off.  I'm not into that.  In some cases yeah but in some cases it wouldn't bother me.  Am I insulting somebody you know? 
[01:20:30]  Not at all.  Okay.  Oh yeah.  I'll make sure.  Everybody I know in my life lets you say, no no no it looks like someone just took an  infant and lifted their arms up and said look at these pits kiddo.  Steve you shave under your arms too?  Waxes.  It's not anymore now.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We all know Steve likes to be clean.  Squeaky clean.  I don't like all the body hair so I need to get rid of it especially when I have to get  the tattoo finished.  I have to shave that armpit.  Hairy Lebanese usually but you shave down a little bit your arms and stuff. 
[01:21:00]  The arms.  I did the chest a couple times.  It's really irritating because you have to.  I go through about two or three razors when I do it.  Two or three razors.  Two or three razors for one shaving?  Of my chest yeah.  Ew.  Yeah.  How hairy are you?  Extremely.  Let me see.  Yeah you can see like that.  That probably grows in like a carpet.  Yeah.  That's the whole thing.  Jesus.  It's on the sides and everything.  Dude it's everything.  I'm Italian and Lebanese.  That's the worst combination to have. 
[01:21:30]  You're this close to being like that werewolf kid.  The werewolf kid.  We saw him on the news recently.  You're really close.  How high does your hair go up on your face?  About mid cheek?  Well yeah I could kind of see mid cheek.  That's not bad though.  And then from let me see down from the bottom of your beard to your chest hair.  It's completely connected.  Yeah it's completely connected.  If I let it go it would be completely connected as would my hairline and my eyebrows.  It's completely connected if I let it go.  His hairline and his eyebrows and his beard and his chest hair. 
[01:22:00]  You shave your forehead?  What?  No it's like right here where my eyebrows would go.  They do this weird thing when I go to the barber.  They take a piece of string and they get into some kind of diamond and they just tear  your hair out by the roots.  What kind of diamond?  What the hell are you talking about?  I've had it done a couple times.  It hurts like a bitch.  It's a special string.  And is it sticky?  No.  The string isn't sticky but somehow it pulls the hair.  It makes like a knot.  It makes like a knot.  I think I know what you mean.  It makes like a cat's cradle kind of thing and then he just yanks it in one direction 
[01:22:30]  and it uproots a whole bunch of hair.  It could be like wax string or something like that for all I know.  Why don't you just use wax?  Wax strips.  I've done that too.  I just use a little scissor.  If you push up on your eyebrow, like above your finger, they'll all pop up and the ones  that are bigger, you just kind of go.  Why don't you just use a pistol?  All right.  Let's get back to the art of the topless.  We get to say hi to, I don't know who this is actually. 
[01:23:00]  Let's see what this is about.  Sure.  She's buxom.  It's the type of audience that finds more enjoyment from a dancer than you give him dancing.  It's a find more enjoyment from slower movements and more suggestive movements than you give  him that.  Oh, she's explaining her the art of the topless.  The art of the topless.  At least they're talking about actually dancing.  How about we do one of these updated now?  Mondo topless for this century.  I don't know.  I'm working to, you know, just go. 
[01:23:30]  I'm trying to get money for school.  I don't know.  I'm just going to stand here and not dance.  I'm going to squat down and talk to guys.  Get up and dance.  Get up and dance.  Show us the art of the topless.  Get to the pole, bitch.  Strippers bug me.  They hate them.  Horny moves.  Hate them.  Shut up.  Just cannot stand that.  They have forgotten the art of the topless, Hopi.  Yeah.  I do believe strippers of this day and age. 
[01:24:00]  It's all about give me 20 bucks so I could sit in your lap.  The art of the grabbing your cash.  Yeah.  Big dumb implants.  No sex appeal at all.  Their lap dances are awful.  One more stupid hair over the lap thing.  I'm going to rip it out by the root.  Wouldn't that be great?  Just grab a big handful of bleach blonde hair and pull out two big fists.  Yeah.  You just got blonde hair wavering as a big bouncer punches your face.  But as he's pulling you out, you refuse to let go?  Yeah.  So she's being dragged out? 
[01:24:30]  All right.  Here's the bimbo talking about personality.  Well, I feel that personality has a lot to do with it.  And I think that I have been able to present a personality that is a little different than a lot of girls have.  She's sexy, man.  Is she?  Yeah, she's her voice.  Yeah, voice.  Well, this next girl, she says she's full of the devil.  She's full of the devil.  The devil!  And it influences her art of the topless. 
[01:25:00]  The topless is quite different from the exotic field because there I am vivacious and alive and full of the devil.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm sometimes vivacious in my exotic work also.  But there are two different type of moods entirely where in the exotic field everything is done with slow enticing movements and a teasing type form.  Where in my topless I am just vivacious and full of warmth and, like, would like to have some fun. 
[01:25:30]  The topless.  So the art of the topless is different than being a stripper?  It's like whore exhibit A and B.  Right.  Yeah, I guess they could rationalize going home and sleeping a little easier with the topless than the exotic.  Well, when I'm in the topless, I'm disappointing my parents this way.  And in the exotic, I'm humiliating them publicly.  Oh, I see.  I think the exotic, dad puts the shotgun in his mouth. 
[01:26:00]  The exotic.  But the topless, he just tries not to make eye contact with the neighbors or any friends.  Or he feels guilty for whatever he did that made you do this for a little while.  Right.  Right.  Exotic, daddy did something to you.  The art of the topless.  That uncle did something to you.  Your uncle did once, but he was from out of town, so he didn't have enough opportunities to ruin you for life.  There you go.  Back to the voiceover guy.  What must a girl possess to measure up as a topless dancer? 
[01:26:30]  She must have a body well above the average in physical beauty.  Unblemished by an uneven suntan, together with a bust line that is firm and youthful.  The topless dancer's face as well must bear an equal burden with the body.  The burden.  Encouraging sensuous and provocative expression.  Supplementing her physically exciting figure.  Wow.  Exciting figure.  Guy does know. 
[01:27:00]  Hey, you know this guy that did the voiceover apparently is still alive.  Yeah?  We gotta get him on the phone somehow.  Get him.  It's gonna be one of those bad interviews though.  Book it.  You mean me?  Yeah, we had an interview one time with the guy that did cartoon voices for everybody.  Yogi Bear, Ranger Smith, Ricochet Rabbit.  Like, all that genre was all this guy.  And we were very excited to have him on our show when we were in Worcester, Boston.  And he got on and, oh my god, he was senile. 
[01:27:30]  We're asking him, you know, hey, could you just do some Ricochet Rabbit?  You mean me?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who else do you think we're talking about?  You idiot.  Then he passed away very shortly afterwards.  Yeah, it was a very uncomfortable interview.  Unfortunately, we didn't get the last interview.  All right, here's the last clip for today.  Mondo Topless, voiceover guy, introing another girl, but there's no voice of this girl. 
[01:28:00]  So, you'll just hear a really, just another fantastic intro by this guy.  Love him.  Completely topless.  Completely uninhibited.  This way out craze that began in San Francisco has now vaulted across the ocean to Europe.  Every sin sinner has embraced this swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Let's jet to Belgium and look in on the famed Moulin Rouge, where the butthom bombshelled 
[01:28:30]  Veronique Gabrielle performs her heady, hedonistic dance of the leather belt.  An incendiary art calculated to ignite the flames of passion within the male spectators.  Her fabulous figure is the envy of women and the delight of men.  There is no one better.  Whoever wrote this is brilliant, by the way.  Yeah, that is great writing.  Incendiary.  Incendiary.  Right.  Oh, wow.  From San Francisco to Europe. 
[01:29:00]  It's kind of a long way around.  Yeah, it's a new.  Shouldn't it sweep the country first?  Yeah, well, you know what it is?  It probably took a loop around Canada.  Yeah, okay.  Passed right by those boring Canucks.  I'm sure it's skipped like Iowa.  Or to the topless, eh?  And there you go.  That's it for today.  Mondo topless.  We'll have more in the coming weeks.  Love him.  Got to get him.  See if he still is alive.  We'd love to have him.  I have to tinkle.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  You guys realize that all those Bucsonics are now in their 60s.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  Ugh.  There's not much bounce left.  The art of the saggage.  It's bouncing off their knees.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  I defy you to a listen to a word.  She says, as an orderly, is changing her diapers.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  When we get back, hopefully Patrice O'Neal will join the program.  Where's Patrice?  Is he here?  Is Patrice here?  Is he here? 
[01:30:00]  Not yet.  Where is he, Steve?  Steve, where's Patrice O'Neal?  What?  What streets are you driving on?  That stupid suburban he drives in New York.  We're having somebody meet him outside so he can come up the second he pulls up in front  of the building.  And how far is he?  I know he's a big star now, but we've been waiting for about an hour.  Yeah.  On the phone.  Ah.  Patrice O'Neal on the phone.  Hello.  He'll join the program next.  Call the O.P. and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-3.

Patrice O'Neal has joined the festivities.  There he is.  And we're talking about, like, moving in and how to get the movers to not scratch your stuff.  Yeah, because Patrice is a homeowner.  Shh.  Well, I'm just trying to say.  Where you live?  And I know where I live. 
[01:31:30]  Shh.  I'm just trying to say that you're growing up, and that's nice to see.  All right, all right.  I blame.  You're growing up.  I blame a girlfriend.  I'll always go, could you not scratch the floor because my girlfriend gets pissed so I  don't look like a total faggot.  Oh, yeah, that won't make you look like that.  Because she's going to hit me.  I'm a battered boyfriend.  As a guy, it's hard to tell another guy, look, the floors, I do care about the way they  look.  Whenever I have new furniture coming in, I greased a guy before he comes in, slips some cash, and 
[01:32:00]  then you go, not at the end.  You don't wait until the end.  Right when they walk in the door, you give them some money, the lead guy, and you go,  dude.  Do a good job.  Just watch.  I go, watch the floors.  They're like brand new wood floors.  Just be careful.  Don't scratch the floor.  Now I know what I did wrong because when I first got my place here in Manhattan, the  one I'm now moving out.  You tipped a rat.  I got the last cool, really big TV before flat screens came down. 
[01:32:30]  So this TV weighed four to five feet wide.  I'm not kidding.  It weighs four to five hundred pounds.  And the next year, the flat screens decided to drastically drop.  And then everyone went and got the flat screens.  That's how much a filled up fish tank weighs.  I guarantee.  I hope this TV is made by Buick.  I guarantee my TV, yes, weighs more than your filled up fish tank.  How big is the bulb?  It's big bulb.  It was the largest picture tube you could get at the time.  It wasn't a flat screen. 
[01:33:00]  It's actually people inside doing a play.  Hope he's like component.  And these guys, these guys showed up with my TV.  I was all excited, you know, started making a little money in this business.  And I splurged.  And I'm telling you, the flat screens, you still couldn't touch them.  They were up at that stupid figure, like tens of thousands.  $10,000.  You could have this 25 inch TV.  Yeah, it wasn't even that.  Exactly.  It's like a real one.  It's the largest.  It's the largest picture tube TV you could get. 
[01:33:30]  40, right?  That's the biggest one.  Something like that.  It's a regular, like regular picture, like regular old TV.  The same technology from when, you know, Uncle Miltie was on, only huge.  Where you got to hold the big back.  Oh, you ever try to move one of those yourself?  Listen.  And you're toppling over forward because the picture tube is eight feet long?  Let me tell you how old that TV is.  Let me tell you what, any TV you got to carry where the tube is on your stomach.  Yeah.  And somebody's lifting the back of the TV. 
[01:34:00]  That's an old television.  That's old.  You get this side.  You get this side.  Right.  And all right, lift.  Right.  There's places for you to lift, but there's no place for this to lift.  When you're done, you got all the dust on your t-shirt from the picture tube.  Wow.  When it's so big, you got to have somebody, you got to put your windows out and have somebody  pull it up from the cord.  Say they're coming in right now.  It looks like you had a Franklin stove next to your wall.  Because there's great marks and soot that was coming out of your TV.  What the hell is this, a locomotive? 
[01:34:30]  Dave, really fast.  My 36-inch Sony TV weighs 425 pounds.  I'm telling you, mine's at least four, possibly 500 pounds.  It shows up.  I'm all excited.  The guys show up with the moving truck.  And I'm like, where's the dolly or whatever, the thing to get the TV into my apartment?  Oh, no.  They rolled it end over end.  They rolled his TV in.  So you say, you know, this side up, rolling upside down, sideways a couple of times.  And I was like, excuse me, could you not do that? 
[01:35:00]  And they gave me the look of death, like, do you realize how much this weighs?  And continued to roll it.  And I went, all right.  All right.  You're the experts.  Yeah.  Because they were scary, to be honest with you.  I wasn't going to mess with them.  And you had a homeless guy living in the box outside when you put the box outside.  Oh, yeah.  That's how big this TV is.  It was like a luxury west side apartment for a homeless guy.  Turned it into a loft.  Yeah.  Rented it out, sublet it.  I got a 61-inch, like, one of the TV now.  It was a 61-inch flat screen or LCD? 
[01:35:30]  Not this LCD.  It's the projection.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think two kids brought it in.  Two children brought it.  It weighs six pounds.  It's like nothing now.  Yeah.  It weighs six pounds.  You can't get anything big and not get a projection anyway.  Plus, I had to get a lot of TVs.  You know what?  And it costs like a dime.  I'm moving soon.  TV's staying.  I can't.  I'm not even going to take it.  I don't want it, and I can't even move it to give to somebody else.  It has to just stay where it is.  Nobody else wants it.  I understand that.  There's nothing usable about a TV with a back to me. 
[01:36:00]  There was a time.  I don't know what happened.  Remember, you used to get a TV, and you had that thing for years.  I mean, I remember an old Zenith television where you change the channel, and then when  cable came around, same thing.  You just popped the box on there, and you had the remote.  You just put it on channel three, and you had the same TV.  There was a period of time that happened that Opie's talking about, and I got sucked into  it, too, where you bought these giant screen televisions, but they were six feet deep and 
[01:36:30]  weighed 6,000 pounds, but you wanted the big screen.  And then, like, two weeks later, hey, new technology.  Look at this.  It's flat as a credit card.  You could carry it with it.  Fold it up like the Jetsons frigging car, and it goes on your wall.  I was the guy, man.  What did I do?  I went to this great place, and there was a nice sale and stuff, and they knew.  They knew.  They probably had the truck in the back lot.  They were offloading the new stuff off the truck.  All the flat screens at a reduced price. 
[01:37:00]  They knew.  Hey, we got another one out here.  Another idiot.  I probably bought the last heavy TV.  Another idiot's just made room for eight more of these TVs.  You know what you could do with that?  Just give it to someone with a pickup truck in the winter?  You know how they have to wait on the back of the truck?  It's like bags of sand or this.  Oh, it's just.  I lost on that one.  That's hilarious.  He's got a real TV.  Like a TV.  Like a television.  It takes out a television set.  With no technology.  Hey, what's your TV? 
[01:37:30]  Just TV.  The kind of, you know, the first one invented.  Alice, we're getting a television set.  One of those.  Takes up half my living room because it's so freaking.  It's just.  Takes up half the living room.  I'm not even kidding.  It's the TV.  With the whole episode of The Honeymooners was about getting that new TV.  Yeah, getting that new TV.  Hello, Captain Video.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  OB's TV comes with a cliffhanger. 
[01:38:00]  His instructions.  Adjust the aerial.  Until the picture is optimum.  I stink on so many levels.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe you just said that.  I lose all the time.  Hey, Patrice O'Neill.  He's doing the O&A traveling virus thing with us.  And we can't be.  Oh, yeah.  We couldn't be more excited.  It's presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  We're heading out right after the show.  We're broadcasting live from WBCN tomorrow. 
[01:38:30]  And, of course, the show is Saturday at the DCU Center in Worcester, Mass.  It's going to be great.  We got all the comedians you know and love from this show.  You do it all day.  Tickets still available.  All four dates you're doing.  I think so.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very, very cool.  You guys, do you want to get into some news with Big A?  Oh, is he behind me?  Yeah.  He's been there the whole time.  All right, I'll move the camera.  Patrice, you got some cash on you today?  No.  I didn't bring you.  Oh, wrong one.  No one has cash today.  We want to do some betting.  I got cash. 
[01:39:00]  I bet $25.  He can't say S-T words.  So we want to get some S-T words that he would really have a problem with.  And we want to bet how long it takes him to say the words.  I bet 1,000 quad louves.  Those shoes.  You are an oaf.  Those shoes are awful.  You really are orthopedic-y.  But look at the way these shoes are bending in.  Poor Big A.  Could you push him that way?  Like, so I could see him a little.  Move the whole mic and everything. 
[01:39:30]  Just get that.  Those shoes are.  Oh, look at the headphone thing just stretching.  His big head holding it like an anchor.  It looks like the anchor line of a destroyer.  Big A, why don't you turn it around so the court doesn't stretch across your face.  Big A, for the first time, say hi to Chicago and San Francisco.  Why are you making him suffer with the stretching of the headphones?  Because he's got to get over there.  Why?  Oh, for the pal talk?  Yeah, so he could see him. 
[01:40:00]  All right.  And it's the middle of the room, you know.  That's where he should be.  And he doesn't want him behind him.  Yeah, and I don't want him directly behind me.  The art of the blubber!  He's breathing heavy.  You got it?  He's about to talk.  Now that we wasted five minutes setting him up.  Big A, for the first time, say hi to Chicago and San Francisco.  They won't use batteries.  Hi, Chicago.  Yeah, San Francisco. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  See how long that took?  Yeah.  And that wasn't even an S-T word.  And wow, he really, yeah.  You know.  Try to say stammer.  He started, by the way.  Stammer.  Oh.  13 seconds.  See?  We got a contest.  Who wants to bet?  Jesus.  Who wants to bet?  This is going to work.  Yeah.  How much are you betting? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  We need a clock.  Who's timing?  You're timing.  Oh, we got all that.  Yeah.  The boys came up with some great S-T words.  All right.  Because we know one of these words will shut him down as a human being.  He'll just, his head will explode.  It'll be over, right?  What if we have a word?  We want to, we want to, we want to, we want to, well, he's going to do the news really fast.  We haven't done anything as far as like current events or news or anything today.  So, yeah.  Big A's going to help us out with that.  And then we'll do a little betting and then we'll get out of here.  Big A, you feel good about being solo today? 
[01:41:30]  Um, yes.  I told people I don't need, um, Lewis here.  Whoa.  I don't need that hack.  Whoa.  Wow.  Oh, he used to have.  He's brutal.  He used to have a news partner.  He's like Dino.  What happened?  He's like Dean Martin.  And, uh, I don't know.  You don't want Jerry Lewis with him anymore.  People are getting sick of Twitchells.  I, I, I think he's great.  I, I, I want him on the show more. 
[01:42:00]  Because he says his name too, Fred.  Lewis Twitchell Santani.  That's what bugs him.  You know, you know what it is?  You know what bugs me?  And I, and it started bugging the listeners.  Just the fact that he started using his name like that.  I'm Lewis Twitchell Santani.  Twitchell Santani.  Are ya?  That's what made it good.  No, it didn't.  Yes, because it was.  It made him too professional.  Like he was trying to be too.  It was so awful.  It was good.  He was proing it up.  Sick.  Y'all make me sick.  What's the matter, Patrice?  Day one.  Day. 
[01:42:30]  You did?  You disrespect my 17 senses, man.  We would try.  It's not even like I disagreed with you, but I was willing to give the benefit of the doubt.  Why no one gets sick of Big A is because Big A, even though he, he knows he has a problem,  he can't, there's nothing he can do about it.  He's so, he wants to be well.  That's the reason that Big A is good.  He wants to stop with the.  Oh, hold on.  Instant feedback saying, could somebody move that Negro out of the way?  And the same thing, right next one down, can someone move that Klan member out of the 
[01:43:00]  way?  So I'm getting, they're talking about Sam.  You're in the way of the Paltok cameras.  Hey, Patrice.  Wait, where is the Sam song?  Yeah.  Let's get an expert.  Let's get an expert opinion from a genuine black man.  We are trying to figure it out.  What about him?  Sam.  What is he?  Does he have black features?  Not, no, not black features.  He's a strange looking kid.  It's like, um.  Like he has, he has Negro hair, but not one black feature. 
[01:43:30]  There's nothing black about him.  What about the big eyebrows?  You don't think there's something going on?  Absolutely not.  You know what he looks like?  Show him his, show him your thumb.  Oh, thumb.  Show Patrice your thumb.  Look at this thing.  What does that mean?  We don't know.  We don't know.  It has like an extra, like, uh, knuckle or something.  So you're saying.  Are you Jimmy the Greek?  That's why they're so good at catching the football.  Sometimes it's hard to really catch OV.  And what do you say?  Are you saying he has a Negro thumb?  I don't know what I'm saying. 
[01:44:00]  What is that, a monkey thumb?  What are you trying to say?  Patrice, I would tell you, I don't know what it means.  What is weird looking is as long as his pointer fit in.  His middle finger and his thumb are the same length?  Yeah.  Which is monkey-like.  Yeah.  But I don't.  He's got huge feet.  Do you have a big, uh, schwanz?  I'm sure he does.  He had to be blessed with us.  Are you packing?  Yes, he is.  He's packing.  Skinny with nothing else going on.  Yeah, and God, God just finds a way to do things like that.  Here's the thing, though, with him.  And you say, you jumped to conclusions too quickly when you said he doesn't have any other 
[01:44:30]  black features.  Look at him closely.  None.  Now, no, no, no.  Look at his nose.  Look at his lips.  Think of that.  I'm not talking about your average black guy.  Look at the forehead.  Picture him being an hour late.  Don't you do?  Not even.  No, do this.  Have you seen black guys that kind of, he looks like the business black guy.  Squint a little to get a little shade.  And then look at him.  See?  Nothing.  See what happens?  Nothing at all.  Nothing.  Like the guy that lives in Connecticut and is like, hey, I'm a black gentleman, but I 
[01:45:00]  like driving my Lexus to work.  I'm trying to get a bead on what he looks like.  It's like a, there's nothing black.  It's not even a Puerto Rican there.  Like, it's not even a Puerto Rican face.  Because his skin is so white, but there's something going on there.  Let's add this to the mix.  Are you ready for this?  Okay.  Related to Thomas Jefferson?  Thomas Jefferson, who we know was out on the plantation.  Was out raping black women?  Absolutely.  I think he's related on the bad side.  There is a whole group of people that get together for reunions every year that are 
[01:45:30]  Thomas Jefferson's offspring.  And we're not joking, by the way, to the new cities.  He's actually related to Thomas Jefferson.  And he is.  He's checked his genealogy, and it goes back to Thomas Jefferson.  That's where we're thinking the black comes from.  So wait, what are you?  One of those slave girls.  What Jefferson was saying is, hey, we've got to bang these slaves.  What do you think?  Pronto.  What do you say you are?  Mic's off.  My parents are both white.  Well, that doesn't mean anything.  All my relatives I know of are white. 
[01:46:00]  You've got to go back.  How many black friends did your mother work with?  Yeah, you better check.  It's something about that hair.  That's not just curly white guy hair.  Yeah, that's black hair, man.  Yeah.  That is black hair.  You don't have sickle cell or anything like that, right?  Okay, just checking.  What's it called?  Because that would be at that giveaway.  Maybe it's vitiligo.  Vitiligo.  Is that Michael Jackson?  And his parents have it, yeah.  Sickle cell and vitiligo.  We're going to just like.  He's whiter than white.  Yeah, he's a white boy.  We're going to just start leaving Popeye's fried chicken and watermelon around the studio 
[01:46:30]  and see who he eats.  Jesus, man.  You know what it is?  See if he eats it.  You know what Sam looks like?  He looks like a photo negative of the black guy.  Oh.  Yes.  Yeah, okay.  He looks like Steve Thomas Howell from Soul Man.  He looks like any black man with white makeup that's really good.  Yo, man.  Do it for Pony Boy.  By the way, here's his song.  Sam's not black. 
[01:47:00]  His ancestor's Thomas Jefferson.  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thumb.  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure? 
[01:47:30]  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a mm-mm, white or a mm-mm.  Yeah, we tease him, you know.  Because he's white with an afro.  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  He ain't black.  See, we had to clean that up for this side of the Opie and Anthony show,  but I think that version's funnier now.  Yeah.  I really do.  Because you're so expecting it.  And the way that came about was I noticed one day that he had hair, 
[01:48:00]  and it reminded me kind of like a Gabe Kaplan type of a hair.  Yeah, yeah.  It was just awful.  I don't know.  Yeah, if you grew that out,  that's definitely like the Brady kids in the final couple of seasons.  Absolutely.  Gabe Kaplan.  There's a sit-down speech coming from his parents one of these days after this show,  after it really starts.  After you keep prodding them and prodding them,  one day they're going to listen and they're going to have a sit-down,  Sam, sit down, and we have to tell you something.  Yeah.  We have to tell you something. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  We do have a little info.  And it starts with, we love you very much.  We used to live in Compton.  And...  We didn't lock the windows.  We didn't lock the windows.  One night on Crenshaw.  Kill both of us or sleep with your mama.  There was a gang of them, so we can't point the finger at anyone.  Matter of fact, the woman gang raped your father.  It was the first woman raping with your daddy, 
[01:49:00]  and then they sent us you in the mail.  Sorry about that, Warriors.  It was the Lizzie.  Sorry about that.  With a Westside on his back.  He tattooed...  He tattooed Westside on his back when he was a baby.  Lift your back up, Negro.  Let me see your stomach.  There's a big tattoo.  Pale life.  No.  All right, Sam.  Okay.  Thank you, Sam.  There'll be a tat there.  There we go.  Get out of here and never be in a country club. 
[01:49:30]  No matter what you do.  Better shave it all off like Romp-A-Stomp  or to have a chance in this society, buddy.  Let's say hi to...  Sam at Bushwood.  Let's say hi to...  Never.  Let's say hi to Big A again.  All right, Big A.  There he is.  So you ready for the news, Big A?  Yes, I am.  All right.  You ready for the news there?  Loaf of bread shoes?  Jesus, man.  What is wrong with you, eh?  All crotched up. 
[01:50:00]  Looks like he's wearing leather gloves on his feet.  Boxing gloves.  Boxing.  Hey, hand feet.  Is that because you want to...  Holy Jesus.  These shoes still look like boxing gloves.  They look like the fake feet you put on the bottom of a stilt.  Wow.  It took him so long to say Nike that they said he must be orthopedic.  Oh, my God.  They do.  Can I get some...  Those are Cornelius' props shoes from Planet of the Apes.  All they're missing is a toe.  It's a toe. 
[01:50:30]  Don't wear those no more, Big A.  I'll take you shopping, buddy.  Oh, my God.  And your arches are about gone, aren't they?  Why don't you get some water?  Wow.  You're walking, like, on the sides of your feet.  Yeah, let's buy him some shoes.  Yeah, shoes for Big A, man.  Nice shoes.  But smaller than they should be.  Yeah.  Want him bound like a little Asian girl.  So it hurts.  So he'll really stammer.  Find his feet.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow. 
[01:51:00]  Pain.  I'm so sorry, Big A, man.  I really hate trashing Big A.  That's why I love when Lewis is here.  Hey, we're getting...  It's not a bad trash.  We're getting pictures of Sam up on opiananthony.com, and then you can fool around with it and help  us out with the big question.  A break?  Ooh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  They're telling us to break.  All right.  Well, we should then, and then we come back and do this.  All right.  No BSing around.  Well, we fool around when Patrice is here.  He makes it so easy.  I know.  We can talk about shoes for 10 minutes with Patrice O'Neal. 
[01:51:30]  You've got to be responsible, though.  All right.  We will be responsible.  We'll get some news in with Big A, and we'll do some betting with Big A as the ONA virus  spreads across America.  Also, later this morning, I got a surprise.  What?  Well.  What?  Raises for everyone?  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  Surprise.  What surprise?  You're hearing things, Jimmy.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yep.  Okay.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:52:00]  That's right.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got to get right back into it.  We're trying to get a bunch of things done before we end this half of the Opie and Anthony  Show.  Then we'll continue on XM.  On the walkover today, by the way, we're buying Big A shoes.  We are?  I'll buy him shoes.  I don't care.  He needs new shoes.  We're doing that today during the walkover.  And on the XM side, Patrice, I want to hear about the Brazil trip.  When we get to XM, Patrice, we're going to talk about his Brazil trip. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, he went back to Brazil.  We've got to hear about that.  And a big surprise.  Let's see.  Coke Logic came up with something.  What, Jimmy?  What are you talking about?  I want a surprise.  Coke Logic has a Russ Meyer promo.  Yes.  That has something to do with the Opie and Anthony Show.  This could be the start of something, is all I'm saying.  We like when the audience participates.  It makes our jobs a lot easier, because then we don't have to come up with this crap.  He's very good at this stuff.  He's imitating the Russ Meyer style. 
[01:53:00]  He doesn't have the Russ Meyer voice or the voiceover guy that does the Russ Meyer films.  But the concept is very, very good.  Coke Logic came up with a promo using the Russ Meyer style for the Opie and Anthony Show.  Listen in.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The venomous voices of the vastly vulgar airwaves.  Introducing the Destroyer.  Operator of the OCD organization, OWE.  The Professor.  The know-it-all neurotic Nancy Anthony.  Swing over to little Jimmy Dorton. 
[01:53:30]  The worthless, chinless, box-a-master of laughs.  Meet the irritating extra of excrement E-Rock.  Or the swishy audio shim Steve C.  And don't forget Sam.  Black and white.  50-50 where it counts.  Corrupting the cavities of hair holes everywhere.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  There you go.  That's pretty good.  It's the beginning of something.  He called Steve a shim.  A shim.  A swishing shim. 
[01:54:00]  He sounds more like Richard Nixon.  And the Jews.  Nixon never got in trouble for that.  Coke Logic, very good.  All right, Big A with the news.  Big A, you finally ready?  Yes, I am.  All right, here's the headlines with Big A.  Take it away, Big A.  He started, by the way.  Go ahead, man.  It's time for the news.  Good morning, news stations. 
[01:54:30]  I'm Big A.  Fidel Castro, who has lesbians.  Lesbians.  Oh, boy.  Lesbians. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, boy.  Lesbians.  Lesbians.  Lesbians.  I think we found the word.  Wow.  That shuts him down.  Fuck.  Oh, wow.  How great is it that he got stuck on the word stuck?  All right, yes.  Fidel Castro, who has been stuck. 
[01:55:30]  In us.  In us.  In us.  The news writers are vicious here.  Up in.  Stubborn stalemate.  Stubborn stalemate.  Made with a nice.  Hate.  For nearly 50 years.  Aid.  Out of sight.  On Tuesday.  Tuesday after undergoing intestinal surgery and instantly instantly instantly entrusting master of masterdom to his brother, Raul. 
[01:56:00]  Casual, who has last addressed his state on his state last Wednesday was said to have looked sickly and stiff. 
[01:56:30]  Holy cow, you can all bring.  Stupendous.  It's so nice.  Wow.  And Castro's going to kill all stool pigeons with a staple of it. 
[01:57:00]  What's the matter with you?  Stubborn stalemate.  No, Dan Rather than even say stubborn stalemate.  I know the writers here, very cruel to somebody who can't say his ST words.  They play off the fact he can't do the ST thing, sure.  All right, let's do the second story.  We only have four of these.  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  Four.  He's got to inform the listeners out there.  New Yorkers pushed the statewide insistence for election... 
[01:57:30]  Wow, we got a new one.  All right, back up a little, so...  All right.  Holy crap.  All right.  It's painful.  You can do it.  Okay.  Quickly, though. 
[01:58:00]  To a new, Chris...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You did not get past that word.  You have to start again because we just screwed up.  All right, I'll do this part.  New Yorkers pushed the statewide insistence for...  Electricity.  Electricity.  Oh.  Wow.  We never knew he couldn't say that word.  Wait a minute, though.  Wait a second.  Let's try to analyze this for a second, though. 
[01:58:30]  Can you say...  Don't look at that paper and say electricity.  Electricity.  All right.  That was electricity.  It's the reading.  That's how they say it in your town, but not here.  Electricity?  Electricity.  Electricity.  He just, like...  Electricity.  Can you say stubborn?  Yeah, he can.  No, he can't.  Stubborn.  Without moving your fingers.  Stubborn. 
[01:59:00]  Stubborn.  All right, let's go.  Electricity.  We got four lousy stories.  He's forging ahead.  No trying to help.  No trying to help this poor guy.  He's not here for help.  He's not here.  He's just...  You think he's here for help?  This is startling.  Even Big A knows he's not here for help.  The last thing we do on this show is help people.  He's going to get new shoes out of this.  Don't you think it's startling?  Big A.  All right, let's go.  He knows he's not getting help. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, poor Big A.  And how nice is it to listen to him without...  In the background.  I'm Louis Twitchell Santani.  I'm missing Twitchell myself.  I'm missing him.  All right, let's go there.  Electricity to...  New Crest Wednesday.  They destroyed records established a day earlier as utilities asked customers to stop using lights 
[02:00:00]  and other electric stuff to ease the train and try to stay away from service. 
[02:00:30]  Our pitches as the temperatures...  He's cheating.  He's cheating.  That's it.  As the temperatures...  As the temperatures...  As the temperatures...  They wrecked heat.  Well, he stalled with the word stall.  Yeah.  He goes like...  Yeah.  And then goes...  Stoppages.  All right.  Electricity.  Two to go.  Electricity.  The news with Big A.  Two to go.  Mel Gibson stalled the Jewish community last week when the food stalled out of his car and 
[02:01:00]  hammered anti-Semitic comments while being stopped for a DUI. 
[02:01:30]  This dude star stumbled.  This dude star stumbled.  Gibson blew a point, one, two, indicating he was nuts.  Don't sober.  In a statement, he said he had suffered a relapse in his battle with alcoholism. 
[02:02:00]  Hating that his upper us to deny the...  Illustrate his honest standpoint.  Holy crap.  Let us breathe for a second.  It's exhausting.  I find myself stop...  I just stop breathing.  Yeah, you don't breathe.  I hold my breath when he goes through that. 
[02:02:30]  All right.  Finally, the fourth and final story there.  Yes.  Yes.  Boxing gloves.  Boxing gloves shoes.  Boxing gloves.  And muffin feet.  And what?  Muffin.  Muffin feet.  Muffin feet.  Hey, biscuit toes.  Have you up and stammer?  Give us a sleeping bag shoes. 
[02:03:00]  Muffin feet.  Muffin feet.  Still more...  Muffin feet.  Make something out of a train set.  The cold carrier.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm sorry.  Astronaut shoes.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  Muffin feet.  One small...  Muffin.  Muffin feet.  Muffin feet.  You gotta leave.  Muffin feet.  Muffin feet.  One small...  Muffin feet.  Muffin feet.  He never steps out. 
[02:03:30]  They run out of time.  We're already on the way home before he gets it out.  Step, step, splash down.  I'll leave old bubblegum feet alone.  Hey, let's say hi to Moby in Connecticut.  Moby.  What's going on?  Stop this, please.  Why?  He's got one to go.  Oh, my God.  One story to go, Moby.  Hang in there.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  A lot of people aren't breathing on the highway right now.  All right, Big Egg.  Start the fourth story again.  Go ahead, balloon shoot. 
[02:04:00]  Hey, eggplant feet.  Oh, God damn.  All right, we'll just tease you.  Go ahead, man.  Just remember, new shoes today.  New shoes for you.  Go ahead, mattress shoes.  Pillow top.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, my God.  Someone's saying they look like Smurf shoes.  Vanilla Gorilla.  Right on, bro.  They have marshmallow feet.  All right, we're ready for the fourth story.  Shoulda do a little soft shoe.  We're not going to be able to bet today, but we'll bet on the other side of the show because  we're running out of show here.  Let's get the fourth story in.  We have a minute 30 to get the fourth story in.  It's only a paragraph.  Let's go.  Come on, mango feet.  He has beyond, in case you're wondering. 
[02:05:00]  Old deep sea diver shoes.  Still more on headiness in the Middle East as Hezbollah fired two rockets into Israel early 
[02:05:30]  Thursday morning.  Hey, beanbag shoes.  Hurry up.  He's standing on two escalades.  Hurry up.  Hurry up.  Hurry up.  We got a minute left in the show.  He was fighting in his fourth week and diplomatic efforts called the Regents headed for a bitter 
[02:06:00]  and sustained war.  Really swimmy feet.  This crisis has set us.  Hurry up, Raph shoes.  Hurry up.  Page for World War III.  A-2. 
[02:06:30]  From us, uttering hammers as you start your day.  Big day, everyone.  And that's how we end the Opie and Anthony show.  Tomorrow, we're live from WBCN up there in Boston.  We're looking for some familiar faces and some new faces to show up and join us, okay?  We're going to continue on XM.  If you're not going to join us, that's fine.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thanks for checking us out.  Thank you, Patrice O'Neill.  All I want is to get laid and eat sandwiches. 
[02:07:00]  That's it.  That's the closest reference you can get to something cool, hip, and groovy.  Cool, hip, and groovy.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dick.  Yeah.  Where do you go when your wife changes the line?  See, I'll be at Anthony show.  I want to be on you.  Well, you've come to the right place.  I help you.  You help me.  We all laugh.  Don't worry.  We're not listening because this is a boring conversation.  Love you too, sweetness.  If you walk past them, don't want to take your jewelry and take your purse and whatever,  you know?  You have no idea what they are.  There are a lot of questions about them.  Real.  Dirty looking. 
[02:07:30]  Freaky night.  Shut up.  Bring on the booze.  Is this the O.B. and Anthony show?  Yes.  Okay.  The O.B. and Anthony show.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show on XM 202.  O.B. and Anthony.  The O.B. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Outside Free FM here in New York City, Patrice O'Neill is with us for the walk.  Yeah.  Hey, one of our regular walkers. 
[02:08:00]  One of our regular walkers.  Marty Lang.  Broke his arm.  What happened to you?  I fell off a mezzanine on 57 and 5th.  How did you fall off a mezzanine?  Not paying attention.  Could someone fix Patrice's mic, please?  Why would it work, O.B.?  Right?  Why does he have the really...  Oh, that's the old mics?  Oh.  Better work.  So what?  You were working and you fell?  Yeah.  What were you doing?  Uh, setting some scaffolding up on the mezzanine. 
[02:08:30]  Ah, man's job.  Right?  Getting sit-knockers ready.  You should know.  Ah, those bastards.  And, uh, and you just fell off?  How far did you fall?  About 14 feet.  Wow.  Handed on my hand.  Look at his arm.  Yeah, you got, like, hamburger arm.  Like, it's the same.  Did you hit anything on the way down?  Uh, a whole beam the whole way down.  Trying to hold on.  All right.  So what were you thinking?  I broke myself like this.  Did it seem like it took a long time to, like, finally hit bottom?  Yeah, it felt surreal, man. 
[02:09:00]  Like, I was watching myself do it.  I said, oh, shit, that guy's fucked, you know?  And then what were you thinking?  You don't believe he was fucking actually driving through Harlem yelling out nigga in a drunk stupor.  Do you see this guy?  Do you see this painter slash construction worker?  Do you believe a mezzanine?  Do you believe that fucking shit?  I don't believe that.  I think he fell.  He fights eight black people by himself a day.  He is a big guy.  Yeah.  He's an animal.  I fell off a fucking mezzanine.  You couldn't think of something better than that?  And you falling for that shit?  I'll be every day. 
[02:09:30]  You saw me broken up?  That's what I said.  One of our regulars is hurt.  He had a fight yesterday.  It was a fucking fight.  Well, it could be a fractured ulna.  I've been alive 36 years.  I've never heard of anybody falling off a fucking mezzanine.  That's Caddyshack enough times.  Well, what?  Ulna, radius, both?  What'd you break?  Radius.  Tomorrow I'm going to put a plate in a couple of screws.  In your fucking head, you mook.  And the greatest thing?  And he's going to do it himself.  Greatest thing.  Huh? 
[02:10:00]  They come out of nowhere.  Like when Reagan got shot.  Yeah, they're all in the place.  Don't worry about it.  Hey, so you don't have to work anytime soon, obviously.  That's got to be kind of cool.  No, no.  I'm going right back to work.  Monday.  Get the fuck out of here.  Why?  What are you crazy?  You don't work, you don't get paid.  You know comp or nothing?  I make time for you guys every day right here.  You see that?  I know.  The guy is a trooper.  How are you not on workers' comp?  If you still need me to take care of Ivan, I'll take care of him.  I guarantee Kevin James has the best left hook you've ever seen. 
[02:10:30]  He's fucking an animal, this guy, man.  I'm not fucking with him.  That's bodyguard material right there.  He's still getting...  Imagine getting your ass kicked by a guy with a broken arm.  I know he can be.  How degrading that is.  You remember at WWF restaurant when you used to be there?  Yeah, yeah.  I had long hair.  I used to get fucking crazy in there.  Used to.  I had a fucking good time in there.  This guy, I'm glad he's on our side.  Oh, my God.  His happiness is threatening.  Yeah.  I love your fucking show, motherfucker.  Remember that fucking time?  Don't tell me you don't fucking remember.  I fucking love you, man.  He's got the...  He's one of these guys that would kick your ass and smile the whole time. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Let me explain something to what he did, because I'm genius at peripheral catching everything.  He set up his camera before he asked me for the picture.  No one does that.  People go, hey, can I take a picture?  Didn't set it up.  He went, hey, you do this and you press this button, you fucking asshole.  Yeah.  Can I take a picture with you?  Nah.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to walk.  All right, bro.  Good luck to you, man.  See you, man.  Take it.  All right.  Fuck it. 
[02:11:30]  Cool, man.  Take it easy.  I got a surprise.  Why, hello.  You used to be hot.  What's the surprise?  Hi.  Talking about you.  I want a surprise.  Hi.  You're hearing voices in your head again.  Surprise.  Hi.  All right.  Look at this one.  You're a miserable bitch.  There it is.  A little iced coffee on this hot day, right?  Go fuck yourself.  He heard you, too.  Hey, look at that.  Wow.  That was the guy from the Great Adventure commercials who's going to get some coffee. 
[02:12:00]  Hi, puppy.  Surprise on the way.  How you doing?  Surprise on the way.  That's good.  Hi.  Hi.  I love a surprise.  Hi.  I want to...  Look at the tits on this one on the orange.  Fat little tits.  They're coming right this way.  I'd like to give them a good pinching.  Ooh.  Is that a nice coffee, ma'am, or a hot coffee?  Let me...  She doesn't want to talk to me.  How could you drink hot coffee on such a hot day?  Oh, New York City.  No, nothing.  I get no response. 
[02:12:30]  New York City's not impressed with you.  Hey, Paulie Walnuts.  How you doing?  That's exactly who the fuck that was.  It was Paulie Walnuts.  Where the hell is Patrice?  So many visual gags on this show.  I'm not walking too fast.  Look at Patrice.  I'm strolling, rollerblader.  You're like 100 feet behind us.  I might fall back to 200 feet.  I don't blame you.  There you go.  This is the last day of the heat wave in New York City.  Hey, how you doing?  Temperature's going to drop tonight.  Finally. 
[02:13:00]  That's good.  Did you see Leslie Nielsen on his cell phone?  Another wonderful celebrity star-studded walk today.  That's cool.  All right.  Miss, you dropped something.  Oh, I got her.  She turned around.  Oh, she's not happy.  I'm really bad at it, but I did get her.  Oh, ah.  There we go.  By the way, the Big A shoe thing is going to have to wait.  None of the shoe stores are open. 
[02:13:30]  Do they sell shoes at Dwayne Reed?  Dwayne Reed's shoes.  They've got to be better than that.  Because that's what he bought.  He bought them from CVS before I think Dwayne Reed is an upgrade.  We'll just give him two bags of cotton balls and have to stick his feet in them.  They're like foam.  I think Big A made his own shoes.  Those are awful shoes.  They're like foam doll shoes.  Big A's the only motherfucker that jogs and his ankles are dirty.  You know, they look like those slippers that are supposed to look like shoes, but they're 
[02:14:00]  big and puffy and cozy.  Oh, God.  What happened to your boy over there, Lee?  Is he all right?  Uh-oh.  We don't know.  Frederick Douglass?  We ain't seen him in a while.  Oh, shit.  A couple of days.  A good leg amputation.  Oh, he'll come back.  Fuck me, man.  He wasn't feeling too good the last time we talked to him, too.  Motherfucker, he wasn't feeling too good ever.  He'll be sitting there.  Those two standpipes he sits on will look like his legs.  Oh, man.  Just be a torso, like Jean Jean the Dancing Machine. 
[02:14:30]  There it is.  Look, now we enter the part of town.  It's like Grand Theft Auto.  You cross a street, and the whole complexion of the town changes.  Now it's very, um, a lot of tourists on this street.  10 feet away from me, God damn it.  How are you doing, sir?  All right.  Stay away from Patrice.  I'm just humping my left leg, man.  He's a big star.  Stay away from him.  Big fan.  Yes.  You're a big star, Patrice.  Yes, thank you.  Does Jason know?  Was that sarcasm?  No.  Does Jason know how awful his shirt is? 
[02:15:00]  Patrice.  I give you love, Patrice.  Does your manager know how awful that shirt is?  He doesn't care.  There's the opening up the back doors.  That's great.  Air conditioning on this bus, ma'am?  Yes, air conditioning.  You enjoying the air conditioning on the New York City bus?  Penny Crone.  That's right.  Penny Crone.  Penny Crone right there.  Yeah, Jesus Christ.  A very famous reporter.  Penny Crone on her cell phone.  No one wants to, uh, talk.  Everyone's in such a rush.  I guess they have real jobs. 
[02:15:30]  Ice coffee keeping cool on this hot tub.  Well, thank you.  Thank you.  She would have talked.  Oof.  That's got to be a lot to carry around on this hot day.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus Christ.  Hi.  I hope she got the earbuds in.  I hope she wasn't listening to us.  She laughed when I said that.  Yeah, I know.  I forget.  We actually broadcast the people.  I got a surprise. 
[02:16:00]  I got a surprise.  What's this very spry step, sir, for such a hot day?  Look at this thankless job.  What is this guy wheeling in?  Bags of steel, bullion.  What are those?  Potatoes?  Probably plutonium for the fucking deli owners.  Oh, look at this complete ass.  He looks like Danny from our show.  Yeah, with Sam hair on his shirt.  It is.  Sam hair. 
[02:16:30]  What's going on, Danny?  He's wearing his Bob Ross shirt.  Looking for a shoe store.  All right.  We're trying to find a shoe store because Big A's got to get new shoes.  Danny is Saturday.  He's trying to play it off.  I don't know what Danny is at.  Big who?  Danny, what's wrong, sweetie?  Why are you sad?  Because all the shoe stores aren't open yet.  Good enough.  Aw.  We'll get his shoes at 10 o'clock.  Big A, come on upstairs, all right?  Come on, Cinderella.  Cinderblockella.  Cinderblockella. 
[02:17:00]  Bye, everybody.  Bye.  Well, I see you love your brother.  We're going to be in Boston, so don't fuck yourself.  No surprise.  Oh, boy.  I see you.  I see you.  I see you.  Massacre.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children. 
[02:17:30]  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's pedophile humor.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  It's a bunch of idiots.  Perversion.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony. 
[02:18:00]  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  That's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's go. 
[02:18:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[02:19:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:19:30]  Let's see. All right. There's Patrice. Jimmy's still in the bathroom.  Hope so to Kenny. Hope you all brought your hope you all brought your A game today.  We're going to need it. 
[02:20:00]  Welcome to the second half of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The only virus spreading across America. We couldn't be happier about it.  This is the part for the new listeners that were listening to us on FM radio.  This is the part where we can say dirty words.  Like shit, fuck.  Right. A couple of examples. Good ones there. Yes, yes, yes.  And talk about adult-oriented subject matter in graphic detail. 
[02:20:30]  Like, fucked her in the ass.  Fisting.  With a cock.  What?  You can't fist with a cock.  There's a fucking ass with a cock.  Oh, oh, oh.  Trying to show people an example.  So I've, on MySpace, I've noticed a lot of people writing now.  A lot of people signing up for XM because they heard us on FM.  Really?  Yep.  A lot of people.  That might be so.  So they heard because it's, it, they get pissed off that they hear, you know, they hear part 
[02:21:00]  of the show on FM radio and then they go, well, now what happens?  Now what happens?  I know they're still going, but I'm not privy to this.  So they, that's all good, but they got to support the commercial stations we're on.  Well, that, yeah.  And that'll, that'll happen.  There's enough cheapo people out there, O.P.  Right.  Enough cheapo people where, uh, we'll do very well.  Hey, uh, do you mind if Patrice sits over there today?  There was a big whole thing where a fan told him to sit there. 
[02:21:30]  Jesus H. Christ.  You don't tell Patrice where to sit?  You don't tell Patrice where to sit.  I don't tell Patrice anything.  You don't come into a place like this studio and tell Patrice where to sit like that.  And you don't mind if Patrice sits over there today, right?  I have no problem.  I would love Patrice to sit right next to me because he usually does.  We have a little side banter sometimes.  Patrice, can you sit over there today?  I never tell you what to do.  You know that.  You're telling me what to do now.  It'll make sense, though.  With a smirk and munching.  I don't get it either. 
[02:22:00]  Is this Trix or something?  No, this is somehow going to come to hurt me.  To hurt me.  What?  Didn't you tell me to sit down to something that hurts you?  Didn't you say that that might just fuck that?  Yes.  Oh, that mic?  Well, that mic.  Now, what happens is it picks up.  Is it that mic?  It was both.  Because it was that fucking mic.  It was Patrice's mic.  Mars tinkered.  Made this one better.  Tinkered?  Yes.  He's an inventor in 1860?  There was a little metal hammer involved.  And so this one might sound better than that one. 
[02:22:30]  Wait.  So we what?  That mic is out of play?  It just won't sound quite as good.  All right.  Just give me an extra mic.  That's all.  I just need an extra mic today.  I want that one placed down in the seat because I like an eyeline of Jimmy.  I just need an extra mic.  Thank you.  That's good.  No thanks.  For no reason, by the way.  I'd like a carrot juice with apple and I'd like a banana. 
[02:23:00]  That ain't photoshopped.  And I'd like...  I bet you would like a big surprise too, Jimmy.  I don't know.  I don't get many surprises.  Where's my surprise?  Where's my surprise?  I didn't say it's like a surprise.  You know.  Where's my surprise?  G-H anything?  You sound like a friggin' horse eating an apple.  What happened?  G-H anything?  You're eating blueberries.  I'm trying to eat my blueberries.  Horrid.  I want a banana, Kenny.  I wrote it down.  Bet you do. 
[02:23:30]  Threes, you want something food?  All right.  I'll give you a banana.  Cup of Joe?  A little something?  Yeah.  Both mics are fine.  What's up?  Ant.  A hug?  Yeah.  You don't mind a complete stranger sitting at that mic then?  Coffee cake muffin?  I'd rather have Patrice sitting at that mic to tell you the truth.  What's the deal?  You want me to sit over there?  Chocolate milk?  I would love for Patrice to sit over there.  No.  Because it's more comfy that way.  I just find it more comfy.  Right.  A way to play that one off.  And me and Patrice have like a little thing that goes on. 
[02:24:00]  Like during commercial breaks, me and Patrice talk.  Or when we're talking about what I want to talk about with this whole relationship, hotel  thing.  Yeah.  It's like I get more of a rapport with Patrice like this.  Before we continue, can I just say one thing?  You really should listen to the show all the time.  Because you just never know.  Because you just never know.  What?  Exactly.  You never know what?  Exactly.  What's going to happen?  I know what the surprise is.  What? 
[02:24:30]  We're firing Steve on air.  That would be a good surprise.  Not a good surprise.  Can you do a mic check?  I want to make sure this spare mic is working, Jimmy.  Please.  If you will.  We're back.  Back in the New York groove.  Psst, psst, psst.  That isn't how you check your mic.  Do it right.  All right.  Let me adjust a little.  Go ahead again.  Perfect.  Thank you. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  Get back to your mic.  We might need that one.  As it just sits there.  Why is that mic?  There's no one there.  Yeah.  So, Patrice went to Rio with his girlfriend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had a good time.  Back in the day, you guys would try to talk me into going on those Rio trips.  I just never did.  You're too much.  That's like the Yankees coming up to you and saying, hey, we're playing Boston.  Come on out onto the field and help us out.  Not really, dude.  Going to Brazil with you guys. 
[02:25:30]  To bang who us.  Would be going with the pros.  Stop stigmatizing it as just bang who us.  I'm not.  I'm telling you.  I'm talking the whole scene.  Talking to him.  I'm talking to anybody who says it's a bang whore thing.  Stop it.  Right.  I'm talking the whole scene is just like this thing where you guys are blurting out words  earlier that I didn't know what the fuck you were talking about.  Termis.  Termis.  We know it as a men's lounge. 
[02:26:00]  To gentlemen's establishment.  All right.  See?  Rookie.  I have no clue.  Gentlemen's establishment.  I'd walk in.  I would need you guys.  I would be a scared little boy going, help me.  I wouldn't know what to do.  We'd take you to help.  Yeah.  You'd drop me off at some awful street where some street urchins would beat me silly.  We would be in your corner.  You would have a good time.  You need it.  You need it.  You need a fucking good time like that.  You too, man.  You need that good time.  And the whores have to be part of it. 
[02:26:30]  They don't have to.  You don't have to.  Are you going down there for a scenic bike ride?  Yes, if you want.  Yeah.  It's fucking Brazil.  Yep.  Yeah, I know.  It's a goddamn, what do you call it?  Tropical paradise.  All I hear.  That little shithole.  Oh.  Right.  All I hear about Brazil.  First of all, stop trying on Brazil, man.  Because you got your.  Oh, man.  He really likes Brazil.  No, no.  All I hear about Brazil are the kids surfing on the top of the trains and getting killed.  They do that in the Bronx.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  They do that everywhere.  Do they?  And AIDS schmades. 
[02:27:00]  Never saw that.  AIDS schmades.  Here's how I look at AIDS.  That's a great way to look at it.  It just can't happen to me.  And I'll tell a girl that.  That's a very unsafe way to look at things.  Do I look like I got AIDS?  All right, magic.  People in Wyoming got AIDS, man.  It's an AIDS-y world.  You're right.  You're right there.  But when you get these hookers, you get these.  They're entrepreneurs.  Entrepreneurs.  Let's rephrase that.  That are down there.  I see where you're going, man. 
[02:27:30]  Just fucking spit it out, man.  Spit it out with passion.  It just seems dangerous.  It seems dangerous, motherfucker.  Listen, when anything is dangerous, it's dangerous if fucking Club's on the kiddies  not walking with you from CBS.  You see that motherfucker with the broken arm and the other guys that's just hovering  around on your hip?  At least if he's going to rob me, I understand what he's saying.  Yeah.  Like, I'm frightened to go to another country.  I'm like a xenophobic.  Let me tell you something, nigga.  You speak knife in any language.  No one pulls out a knife, and I have to wonder what he's thinking or want. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, man.  Look.  That means whenever I got this word for fuck, you take it.  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  And it's not like that, man.  It's what you do.  All right.  So come on.  So the back history, you guys used to go down there.  There used to be a whole group of you.  Yeah.  Everybody fell off.  As single men.  Everybody fell off.  And everyone fell off.  The crew fell off.  Yeah.  Except Patrice.  You might remember when we first started on XM, Patrice came in here all proud with this  briefcase filled with glass.  Glasses.  Glasses.  Glasses.  Glasses.  Glasses.  Glasses.  Glasses.  Glasses.  And we actually looked at you and said, you have a problem. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you took it to heart?  Yeah.  Well, you know what it is?  It's just that you escalate sexually with a person.  And that was a phase.  That was a phase of escalation.  And also, that was a phase also because I had a lot of girls at the time.  I had a lot of different, like, you know, I had a lot of different women.  Here in the States.  In the States.  In the States.  Right.  And I could not keep up with the Joneses.  Right.  As they say, I had to.  With the Johnsons.  It's hard to disconnect and humiliate a bunch at once. 
[02:29:00]  And that duffel bag did it.  That's another thing I have a problem with you.  A duffel bag.  That's saying humiliating this.  I'm a giver, man.  And I try to get.  You're like an assassin walking around with a briefcase full of shit.  Yeah.  I try to get as much as I'm very connected with sex.  James Bond of sex.  You know?  As you get older, because I'm 36.  I know you're a little bit older.  Oh, I got to be 20 years older than that.  Look, your dick cannot work the same way it worked at 22.  It fills up.  Like I said, my shit fills up.  But it has soft spots in it.  And I cannot use a condom anymore. 
[02:29:30]  So it's like a lot of things forcing me to be faithful.  When you were at bag, do you lose sensitivity?  Motherfucker, I lose sensitivity.  I have to punch my dick in the face.  I have to start a fight with my dick for it to get hard.  What you say, motherfucker?  You got soft spots.  Soft spots.  I got claudate arteries in my dick.  He's got like a dick with a baby head on it.  It's got a little soft spot.  You got to be careful.  It's a bruised banana.  It is.  It has places in it that's like, wow, it's soft.  And it's like, you know, look, I'm becoming faithful just out of necessity. 
[02:30:00]  But I still have to keep my focus on how to keep my girl how she is.  It's the eye on the prize.  It's rules.  It's rules and regulations.  Now, this is what kind of got me earlier when we were talking over there, was the whole hotel room thing.  Now, you're in a relationship that I completely cannot understand as being a relationship.  We are worlds apart as far as relationships go. 
[02:30:30]  I don't think you're weird on this.  I think a lot of people think like you.  I'm different.  A lot of people's relationships are different.  Why are you happy with your woman?  Like, what makes you happy?  Happy with my girl.  Like, the thing that makes your relationship great.  That makes it great?  We're a lot alike.  We're a lot alike.  Like a lot of the same things.  Men.  It's not.  Men.  That's it.  Men.  A nice cock.  I.  Like, if we're both, like, lazy, so each one of us aren't yelling at the other one to pick shit up. 
[02:31:00]  Like, there's clothes on the floor.  My side of the bed.  I'll give you an example.  I get ready for bed.  The shit comes off, goes on the fucking floor.  When I come home, it's still on the floor.  Eventually, I'll pick up a pile and throw it in the laundry.  But it's not like she's going, why the fuck are there clothes on the floor?  And I've been through that shit before.  Pick up your fucking clothes.  Why?  Who's coming over?  The Pope?  What the fuck is it?  I'll put it away later.  Sunday can be spent all day laying in fucking bed. 
[02:31:30]  Basically, what you found, what you've got, you've hit the lottery, as they say.  Usually, men don't hit the lottery.  Usually, men have to create their own happiness.  Oh, did I mention she's 20 years younger than me?  That's another plus.  It's very, but see, that's, I don't know.  I'm teasing.  Is she 20 years?  No, I'm not.  Yes, she is.  Is she 20 years younger than me?  Yeah.  I didn't know she was 20.  They met when Ant was 30.  It was a close one. 
[02:32:00]  You used to carry her around in a backpack in early years?  Let me just say, I had to know where a couple of schools were.  You hit the lottery with her, though.  You hit the lottery.  I didn't hit the lottery.  I had to create happiness.  Your woman is awesome, though.  She's sexy, man.  I hit the lottery in time.  She's got a nice personality.  But here's the thing.  She loves showing her kids in front of 500 to 600 ONA listeners.  She does not, she doesn't have that personality.  Halloween show?  It was made to be, she's become my girl, as they say. 
[02:32:30]  Like, your girl, even though you're with her and you're with your, you still with your woman?  Yeah.  You know, it's like, she's become my girl.  She knows certain things will make me happy.  Is she happy with that?  Or you don't know or care?  Because my happiness, it trickles down to everybody, man.  If I'm happy, she's happy.  What the fuck, what the fuck does she have to have, what does she need to be happy for?  Just as long as you're happy, she's happy.  She's fucking got it, man.  Wow.  I give her anything she wants, man.  I take her first class to Brazil, motherfucker.  I have a question for Patrice, because you and I are very similar. 
[02:33:00]  Now, I'm, let's just, there's a reason I'm asking this.  Let's just say it may relate to my own life at times.  Uh-huh.  You're dating a girl, and I know your girl, who is very hot.  She's a good-looking woman.  Oh, yeah.  Really good-looking woman.  I lucked up in terms of her good-looking, she's a beautiful girl.  She's hotter than you deserve, and I'm not knocking you, because, look, I,  any hot girl I date is hotter than I do.  She's out of my league, logistically, she's out of my league.  Physically.  She just, if you see her, but that was more when you were a young man. 
[02:33:30]  I'm fucking pushing 40.  No woman's out of my league now, because I know it's too late to give a fuck,  because my dick is slowly getting ready to retire, and the thing is,  it's winding down.  They play dick in for six innings, just so it gets credit for the game.  No, no, I have a question for you.  That's why I'm asking that.  Go ahead, man.  My question is this, because, like, I'm too self-conscious to take off my shirt  around a girl, like, because of my stupid little tits and my mushiness. 
[02:34:00]  Right.  So it fucks up the sex a little bit, because I'm intimidated by her being good-looking.  I don't even believe that.  Oh, no, it's true.  I mean, if it's with a fucking girl I don't care about, but if it's a girl I really  like, I'm embarrassed she's going to, like, be with me when I'm completely naked  and just go, ugh.  Like, I can't even ask her to play with my nipples.  My girl in Brazil, she talked about, I have the worst ass in history.  People, men talk about how awful my ass is.  Nick DePaulo called my ass.  Two things that I never forgot bothered my ass, that I might get an ass transplant. 
[02:34:30]  Nick said my ass looked like a woman cop.  And Keith said, you need a stunt ass.  You need something to hire a person to come in and be your ass.  My girl, for an hour and some change, this is why the trip was great.  I found out she's actually hilarious.  Yeah.  Because it was just like, it was, it's so relaxed.  There's nothing to think about.  She talked about my ass for an hour.  And she, it was the worst trash and I've ever got by my seat. 
[02:35:00]  Wow.  And I looked at it and go, you know, your ass cheeks are only two inches wide and two  inches deep.  And it was so fucking painful as she squeezed my ass and looked at the inches and said, wow,  your ass is only two inches.  And she, and I was like, it was the greatest thing in the world because the reason to go  to your thing, Norton, is because they're not us.  That's what you got to, you got to understand.  They're not us.  They don't think like us.  They don't, they love us for other reasons other than physicality. 
[02:35:30]  A woman version of me, if I was a man version of my girl and a woman version of me was trying  to be with me, I'd be like, look, get the fuck out of my face.  Women cannot personality their way into shit.  They can't fucking tickle their way in.  They can't jump their way in.  They can't intelligent, intelligentize their way in.  And it's like, look at you, you fat bitch with a two inch ass.  Get out of my face.  But my girl loves me because it's like, I'm cool to her. 
[02:36:00]  The other things, the things that make you happy, make her happy.  You're a winner.  You're fucking.  I try.  You know what I'm saying?  You got, you just got how you are and she's how she is, man.  But you still got to be wary because of the animal they are.  You know, just because she's lazy don't mean it's going to stay.  You got to keep that.  You got to keep the shit.  What I was getting at is it's the whole thing with the hotel room.  Oh, right.  Now, Patrice mentioned, just casually mentions that when he's down in Brazil, he got two hotel rooms.  Right.  And we were, you know, thought that was a little odd. 
[02:36:30]  How the hell did you pull that off?  I told her the fucking honest to God truth.  The honest to God truth was, I don't want to look at you for two weeks.  I was there for two weeks with her.  Why would I want to be?  It's your girl.  But what you said was, I don't want to see shoes laying around and shit and this and that.  But isn't that part of.  Her fucking shampoo and all that.  Get the fuck out of here, man.  I like my hotel room a certain way.  Like you're single.  You like your hotel room like you don't have a girlfriend.  Look.  Doesn't that send a signal to her? 
[02:37:00]  They shouldn't smell it.  She doesn't want to smell her logs and she doesn't want to smell his logs.  I understand that.  It's like we had.  She was very happy because she likes to walk around and just look up in the sky like a retard.  Or sometimes like just, you know how girls are, they just, and, and, and, like she just did when she practices singing and she just goes, like this, she's reading this book about singing and she wants to learn, she wants to do a play or something.  You don't find that cute?  I find it annoying because I hear it and she's going, and then she goes, and knowing that I'm an asshole, how can she concentrate with me going, what the fuck are you doing going, why don't you get the fuck out of here? 
[02:37:30]  She would never be happy because I'm, I'm an annoying guy.  Don't you think she'd be happier if you did enjoy some of the little things like looking up at the sky like a retard or thing?  Are you fucking super in love?  I'm just, somebody needs to shoot you in the face with a, don't give a fuck, no, nigga.  You are some in love niggas, man. 
[02:38:00]  Look, look, I'm not basing what I'm saying completely on my own feelings in a relationship.  I know I'm taking it to the extreme here.  Go ahead.  But what I'm saying is you are taking it to the other extreme.  And, but that's really you.  Wait, you don't think getting a separate hotel room.  I think that's crazy when you have a girlfriend.  You and your girl getting separate hotel.  Me, me and Opie going on a road trip, separate hotel rooms.  Holy shit.  I was like, what are you doing at?  You and your chick, it's like you.  A morning.  A morning in the big bed. 
[02:38:30]  She's not going to appreciate the fact that you, there's time you want to spend away from her on a vacation like that.  I understand.  Yes.  I agree with Aunt Moore, but I wish I could pull off what Patrice does.  I know what you're saying is more realistic for most of us, but I wish I could pull off what Patrice does.  Time spent away is like she wants to go to the spa, something like that.  Yes.  And you want to go to the beach or something like that.  That's fine.  That's time away.  But in the hotel room, that's like, bitch, when I need you, I'll fucking ring the bell. 
[02:39:00]  Well, well, Mr. Kumia.  Yeah.  Let's be honest here.  Uh-huh.  That is what you do.  There's a saying, me and my man, it's like, because he was having trouble with his wife, you know, and they was having separation problems and shit like that.  And he just goes, man, I don't understand, man.  I just, I'm happy being separated, but I'm not.  You know what it is?  I want, men want to be by themselves, but they don't want to be alone.  I want to be by myself most of the time, but I never want to be alone. 
[02:39:30]  Like my new house, I want her and her daughter to stay over, but I don't want to look at them.  I just want them there.  You want to know they're there?  Yeah, I just want them there.  I don't want to fucking talk to them.  He has, please.  That is a weird fucking thing.  It's called an emperor syndrome.  When you, you piece of shit.  Whatever, man.  This is what Patrice wants.  And they come in, which is pretty awesome.  Yeah, but what the fuck?  Is that bad?  Yes, it is bad.  Let me tell you something.  This is, this is.  Because you're cultivating a woman. 
[02:40:00]  It's not bad in his, in his eyes though.  But you're cultivating a woman.  The guy's pulling it off.  That is not being honest to herself.  She, you, you, because you're happy, you then assume everyone's happy around you.  You don't think that.  Which is probably not true.  You don't think that we sit and talk all fucking day.  Let me tell you what my girl is.  When?  My girl.  She's never around you.  You're always throwing her the fuck out.  That's not, look it, I, she's, my girlfriend, and we've talked about this, man.  I, I, we know history.  You know your woman's history and things like that. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  You, she comes in with the fucking issues, with the issues of, of before.  No guidance and sick.  If you, if you, if somebody's sick in your life, man, you got to give them fucking medicine.  You don't just let them walk around sick.  Like, okay, for instance.  Your medicine is like leeches, though.  But for instance, for instance, I have an ex-girlfriend's boots.  Boots in my closet.  They're just in my closet.  Why?  Because I, I never had, I, she's not my enemy.  We just don't go together.  And she had boots over miles.  And she's called me and said, can you send me my boots? 
[02:41:00]  And I'll, I'll forget or something.  If she ever, if I ever think about it to send it to her or she comes in the States, I'll give  her her boots.  So it's not like I threw her fucking boots away.  And my girl's going off about these boots.  Why, why, why, why?  Okay.  So I'm sitting there going, I'm, I'm getting defensive.  And then I go, bitch, you got a kid.  You have a, a daughter.  Holy shit.  You're, I said, I got to look at somebody's ball.  I know what he means.  In my face, someone else is fucking you in my face. 
[02:41:30]  And I talk to her, give her love, give her food.  And you talking about some fucking boots, nigga.  You got a tattoo with a nigga's name on it.  Are you fucking joking me?  Don't give me stress.  Cause I don't give her stress about shit, but she's abusive.  That's what women do.  As soon as, listen, they're abusive.  She's an abusive girl.  And she tests me.  Let me tell you what it's like.  It's like, it's like running a karate school. 
[02:42:00]  You understand?  It's like running a karate school.  And okay.  And you got a few students and one student, which is her.  This is why I don't fuck around with other girls no more.  Cause my girl has a black belt in me.  When I first met her, the bitch was a white belt.  And then she said, you know what?  Every, every time she wants to raise her belt, I don't know it.  She just gets in a stance and kicks at my head.  Cause she goes, motherfucker, you ain't shit no more.  I learned everything I can learn from you. 
[02:42:30]  So I'm better than you.  So you got to do something and show her that you still know more shit that she's challenging.  That's what they do each level.  So right now I got no room for other students.  She is from, for her to keep thinking that I am the best person in the situation.  I have to focus on her cause she's good now.  She wasn't good before, but she's good now.  And she tests me and that's what they do.  They test me.  Okay.  You're a man's dream. 
[02:43:00]  You're like what guys want, maybe.  Yeah.  Like want it to be like you're super man.  You're super guy.  You, you have gotten, made it an art to manipulate a woman and mold her into what you want.  But without her thinking, without her thinking, it's, you ever see 1984?  Yes.  Read the book.  I say see because I don't read.  But, but, but, you know, the album by Van Halen. 
[02:43:30]  I read Charles.  They couldn't kill the guy.  They couldn't fucking kill the guy until he absolutely really accepted what they were pushing on him.  Like, like he could fake it and be kind of like, you know, yeah, I'm with you.  I understand all this.  Everything's cool.  This guy's great.  But until he actually accepted it in his mind and you've gotten to the point where you get these women or this woman.  To really, truly believe that the most important thing is your happiness. 
[02:44:00]  It absolutely is.  And that way she is happy.  And yes.  All right, let me go to Jake.  Oh my God, you're a psychopath.  No, he must.  Anthony.  He's not, he's not alone.  Hold on.  Thank you.  Jake, what's up?  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly what he's talking about, about wanting them there, but not wanting to have to talk to them and all that shit.  That's exactly how I feel.  And that's, I think that's how all guys feel.  And any guy who doesn't feel like that is just.  Bullshit.  Thank you.  All Patrice is doing is vocalizing or behaving in a way that every one of us wants to behave, but is afraid of the consequences of doing it. 
[02:44:30]  We don't want to be lonely and alone.  See, you're, what are you, you're 52.  You've had episodes health-wise.  So you are afraid of slipping in the bathtub and no one there to coddle you.  Jesus Christ, I'm like I'm 80.  It's a fear of being alone, and I understand that shit.  You don't want to be alone, but you want to be by yourself.  That's what we fucking do.  We're by ourselves creatures. 
[02:45:00]  Jesus, I've been like this since I was 20 years old.  I deal with my relationships pretty much the same way I have my whole life.  This is it.  So you know what?  It really has nothing to do with alone or.  Because you hit the lottery.  What's the woman's name again?  I'm sorry.  Men.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, man.  I forgot.  Listen, you hit the lottery.  Your attitude, you hit the lottery with her.  The way you go, you go, like your last situation, it was bad shit.  But you could have made that situation better. 
[02:45:30]  It's your fault for not making it better.  If I let my girl be a certain way, she's going to fucking take advantage of me.  Because that's what, here's the secret to the whole thing.  You have to keep them two things.  Hating you for how much they love you.  And you have to keep it.  I'm serious.  They have to fucking hate you.  You are amazing.  And they have to always want you.  If there's ever a time she thinks she got you, she's not interested anymore.  But listen, I am a fucking mess.  I looked at myself naked the other day. 
[02:46:00]  The muscle, I used to have muscular legs.  They're starting to get back.  I'm a fucking mess.  If she ever thought that she had me, do you think the only reason she fucking stays with  me, because she wants me, to some degree she believes that she's replaceable.  It's an ego thing with women, man.  And if she doesn't have a battle with herself by the feeling the way she feels about you,  your relationship stinks. 
[02:46:30]  Your woman thinks you're cool right now.  If she ever looks at you like a not cool old man, she's going to know.  Hold on, hold on.  Who's this?  Elo.  What's up, dude?  Is that Elo?  That's Elo.  That's Eric Logan.  You don't return my calls.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Jimmy, turn around.  Oh, wow.  All right.  All right.  Holy Jesus.  Mother of God.  We're in trouble.  You know something. 
[02:47:00]  You got bravo.  You got balls.  Bravo, Whoopi.  Whoopi Goldberg in studio.  Wow.  Good morning.  Good to see y'all.  I understand you've been sending messages for me to come in.  So I decided I'd come up and see y'all, because I know you were concerned about a couple  of things, and I really wanted to clear it up, you know, because especially the whole  thing about the, you know, the, what do you call it, the, the what?  The stuff that you put on your.  The sunscreen.  Yeah, the sunscreen.  Because I know you were concerned that black people didn't know anything about sunscreen, 
[02:47:30]  so I thought I'd come up and tell you your mamas were wrong.  They put the wrong shit on you.  You know what?  So let me just run through all of it.  All right.  So it's here.  All right.  And I'm pleased to see y'all.  I'm pleased to see y'all this morning.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  What's up, boys?  Oh, hi, Whoopi.  This is so amazing.  She's so amazing.  Oh, man.  Like, super.  This is like.  No, you have no idea.  Patrice, we've been, we've been beating her up the last three days.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Quite a bit.  Welcome to New York Radio.  I just saw you the other night, by the way. 
[02:48:00]  Where were you?  I was over at the Stephen King reading.  Was that amazing?  Very, very amazing.  The three of them just, I, I was loving it.  I was loving it.  And let me tell you something.  I was sitting directly up front.  I, like, got the, I went through the auction.  Right.  You know, it's a great charity.  Right, right, right, right.  Went through, got front row tickets.  Right.  I hear, and now, let's introduce the star of Sister Act and stuff.  Me and my girlfriend looked at each other and went, holy shit.  Fucking Whoopi's coming out. 
[02:48:30]  And she looks down.  Oh, no.  I didn't expect it.  We were laughing our asses off.  And, and I said, the next day I came in and said, Whoopi was very funny at the podium.  It was a good night.  It was a good night.  I got, you were in your element.  Yes.  And that was great.  It was.  It was very cool.  But the fact you two guys have been shitting on that show, I mean, should definitely now  give you pause because she came in.  Shut the fuck up.  You were right with us.  You're an instigator.  I agree with the word with that.  And the cream, just keep eating so you don't even have to talk on this whole thing.  Here's the deal. 
[02:49:00]  Here's the deal.  You know, I, I knew that I was going to get something from somewhere.  And so I expected it and it was cool.  It was cool.  So the, the, the fleas, what do you call them?  The, the pests.  The pests.  That's funny.  Why aren't you doing this stuff on your show?  Because my show is geared to women in the morning and that's the, that's what we're doing.  That's why it's a whole different group.  It's a whole different group.  It certainly is.  It's a whole different group. 
[02:49:30]  So I'm trying to be good.  Let's be honest.  Did the One Pest get to you?  You know what?  It didn't get to me until I left the studio and there were a couple of guys around.  And it kind of made me uncomfortable because I can't hit anybody.  You know what I mean?  So if somebody comes up to do something, my first instinct is that they're going to hurt me.  Right, right.  So they freak me out a little bit.  But, no, you know, I'm aware of what you guys do.  You know, I know how you work.  And I've known your show. 
[02:50:00]  You've been around forever.  But everybody knows that.  I know.  You know, everybody knows that.  But, you know what?  Why do they have to show up?  You ruined everything.  You really did ruin everything.  We had weeks in us.  I know you did.  I know you did.  September ready to go.  You know, but you can always come back and do it.  But just let me establish the ladies first, please.  Because here's what happened.  And because they jammed the phones, all these women got really pissed off and said, you 
[02:50:30]  know what?  If we can't talk to you, we're not going to listen.  And that kind of flipped everybody out.  She's asking for a truce.  No, no, I'm not.  I'm saying to you, you guys have been doing your show for years on both ends.  And I know that a lot of people are concerned.  They say, why are you doing this?  You know, the truth is, I can't be me and still do the movies I used to do because people  are too nervous about it.  They just get big.  You say one thing, they're like, oh, we can't work.  You can't say that anymore.  So you have to kind of just sort of. 
[02:51:00]  No, he'll always work.  Yeah.  He'll always work.  But you can't.  So I think to myself, do I really want to go back and forth to California and beg for  work?  And these guys said, you know, we're not afraid.  We'll put you on because we're trying to get to the women.  I said, cool.  Stay in New York.  Stay home.  Have a good time.  I love you guys.  I know you're out there.  You're silly as hell.  But you always have been.  You always have been.  I hate this.  You know, well, Seth, we've done it with Whoopi.  No, you don't.  You can actually be yourselves if you want to. 
[02:51:30]  We were so excited.  Hold on.  I got to tell you.  We were so excited that we were going to have a new enemy.  We can't.  I know.  Whoopi.  Now she comes in all night.  Now we have to go on.  Can we trade Jimmy for, um, Cubby?  I don't know.  But I.  This is all fun.  But this is to me what a comic is.  This is what a comic does as opposed to, like, an actor, like a pure actor.  Yeah.  Like, a pure actor would just hide and nothing.  This is the comic.  Just comes out and confronts it.  You know what?  I thought I might.  I thought I might.  Where's your next stop?  Beirut? 
[02:52:00]  Jesus Christ.  If I can.  You know I don't fly.  You war wrecker.  I know I'm a bitch.  I'm a bitch.  But, uh, you know what it is?  If you understand what folks do, if you understand the rag and if you know what it is, then you  can sort of deal with it a little bit better.  But if you don't, and, you know, actors are sensitive that they're not comics.  They're not comics.  And so they don't have the thick skin that we like to think that we have until somebody  messes with us and then our lips poke out and then we go, yeah, I'm a good help. 
[02:52:30]  All insecure and stuff.  Yeah.  Down deep, all of us are, like, really insecure.  So the best way to get around it is to just beat somebody else up.  Aren't we awful people?  Just to make ourselves feel better.  But, but, but you know what?  It's, it's, it's, it's cool.  We can have our listeners call tomorrow and say how great you are.  No, they, they won't believe it.  They won't believe it.  But just, if you tell them to call, it's cool to call.  Just don't physically, don't scare them.  By the way, is that guy going to kick our ass?  Yeah, wow.  Who is he? 
[02:53:00]  He looks like, he's like, why are you doing this, Whoopi?  He's just waiting for a problem.  No.  Who is he?  This is my, my company partner.  You cool?  We run our company together.  You cool?  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I just want to come in and say.  He's not loving this.  No, he don't like us.  He's like, I told you not to do this.  Get it over, Whoopi.  Get the hell.  I got to say, Whoopi.  Should we or should we not?  And, and the, the idea of coming up and, and saying, look, here's what's happening.  And we're all trying to, you know, make a little dough.  We're trying to make a living, having some fun.  And I thought I figured, again, I feel like I felt like I got a lot of telegrams from you 
[02:53:30]  to come over and visit.  A lot of people are saying we're scared and stuff.  No.  No, I got to do it.  She would have set up balls on this woman.  She comes in.  We respect people that, yeah, that come to us face to face.  What are you going to do?  What?  What?  Yeah.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  The woman comes in here and sits down and just starts talking.  You know what?  The reality is bravo.  I did just grab the mic, didn't I?  I just grabbed the mic and like, okay.  Yeah, that mic's been waiting for me. 
[02:54:00]  Bravo.  Listen, all you listeners, all you ONA listeners, we know that you're out there.  We know you're having a good time.  We know what you're doing.  You got to give the guys kudos, man.  You got to give them kudos.  You can't be pissed that they are respectful.  When I'm respectful to them, they're not going to smack me down.  What do you think they're going to do?  You do a very different show than us, and that's why it's so easy to go.  We're going to do fine.  Yes.  And we're not going for the same audience.  No, no, no.  But you just took away all our fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We played your demo tape this morning.  What the hell are we going to rag on now?  Do we have anybody?  We have to go back to Jim Kerr. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, God.  Not Jim Kerr.  He's on 104.3.  Jim Kerr and the Morning Crew.  Or something.  I have to apologize to Whoopi.  Why?  Why did you say something really bad?  You read it in the paper.  Oh, you call me a bitch.  Yeah.  You know, here's the deal.  But you have to apologize to him.  It's true.  Why?  Why?  Because I said you don't know when I'm...  And here's what I'm talking about.  Who's going to apologize first?  Because you have to apologize, too.  I apologize.  Because you got to us a little bit with the Howard Stern thing.  I'm sorry. 
[02:55:00]  Did I really?  No, not real.  No, I didn't.  Full of bananas.  Full of bananas.  We just love seeing our name in the paper.  We're in the paper again today, matter of fact.  Yes, you are.  Yeah, we're publicity whores.  We know it.  Whoopi, I apologize for calling you a bitch.  You know what?  It's okay because it's true.  You know, there are occasions when the beatch comes out of me.  See, you know what it is?  I'm trying to remember all the stuff I'm not supposed to say, but I'm okay because I'm  not going to say it.  Oh, it's a satellite, yeah. 
[02:55:30]  So I'm like, okay, don't say, figure out a better way to say, it's a lot of new stuff.  Just forget all about satellite radio when you go in tomorrow.  Yes, yes, because when I go in tomorrow, I'll be like, hey, motherfucker.  Welcome to Wake Up with fucking Whoopi.  Could get in a little bit of a jam.  I can't afford it.  By the way, that goddamn little theme was stuck in our head all morning.  Which one?  Because we played it all morning.  We played it all morning.  Do we have it here?  Wake Up with whoop.  How'd it go?  We don't have it here.  Why would it?  Well, no one knew you were coming.  It's all waking up with whoopi. 
[02:56:00]  You know.  It's like a little jingle thing.  Is it the jazzy one?  Yeah, it's almost jazzy, like almost an old-time jingle with a couple of voices in there and  stuff, and it got stuck in our heads.  I'm sorry.  We were cursing you.  Are you really going to try a nice show, though?  As a comic, you've got such an edge to you.  That's what I don't understand.  You know what it is?  When I go do my stuff, it's mine.  When I'm working for this, it's like doing the Oscars.  When I'm working for them, I can be funny, but I'm on that mill. 
[02:56:30]  I'm on the treadmill.  Well, when you're doing a show in front of some Democrats, too.  Well, actually, were you there?  No, I was not there.  See, I wish I could find somebody who was there, because in fact-  Wait, what are you talking about, by the way?  She kind of ripped into the Republican-  I actually didn't.  Or it was reported.  It was reported.  And that's the most interesting thing about this, is it doesn't have to be true anymore.  Yeah.  Someone can say something, and it's right there, and people run with it.  And then when it's not true, they say, oh, I'm really sorry.  It wasn't true. 
[02:57:00]  But when they're saying it, it's like, hey.  Right.  But it's not that I hadn't done it.  I didn't do it that night.  I don't mind taking heat for stuff I do.  But blame me when I do it.  Yeah.  You know?  So it was a little bit disingenuous on their part to sort of make a big deal.  You've been known to pick on a few people, though, and be a little potty-mouthed sometimes.  I have no problem with potty-mouth.  I love potty-mouth.  Yeah.  And I'm mostly on politicians from either side.  But see, whenever one side is talking about how much of a potty-mouth I have and how much I rag on them, 
[02:57:30]  they never mention that I rag on the other side as well.  I rag on everybody because they're all full of poo-poo to me.  You get that sometimes.  We'll be talking, and then you'll get like the –  You see, I just said poo-poo.  You can say shit.  What happened to me?  Just say shit.  The left will call you like a right-wing lunatic, and then you say something else, and then you get –  And then the other side.  Yeah, the next feedback you get is the same thing from the other side.  You know, it's never-ending, and after 20 years, I know this.  And you kind of go, yes, okay, I know this is going to happen.  But when I'm doing my stuff, when it's my stuff, when nobody else has to take any heat for it 
[02:58:00]  or any responsibility for it, then I can go berserk.  But when it's about something else, that's what I'm going to do.  It's not so much that it's a nice show, but look at this, man.  Look at all these papers.  I can't look at them anymore.  I can't handle it anymore.  That's just it.  Now, you've only been on a couple of days, but is it hard to steer away from that?  I mean, there's got to be some days where you wake up and go, God, I just want to rip this guy apart.  Wednesdays are my days to just – because we call it Kvetch Wednesday. 
[02:58:30]  And Pee-Pee's.  People of Pee's.  You have to give every day a name.  Manners Monday.  Yeah.  We heard Manners Monday.  Manners Monday.  What was Tuesday?  Tuesday – you don't remember?  Full everyone with –  Frosty.  Fuck them Friday.  I'm prostating.  Speaking of which, have you guys done – have you gone and had your prostate check?  All joking aside.  Let me tell you.  First one was last year.  I just went back.  In three months now is my next year, and I have to go get the – it's not fun, Whoopi. 
[02:59:00]  It's not fun, but do you know what – do you know how many people are – have – I've  lost so many male friends that it's become really like a pain in the ass crusade for me.  Literally.  But I'm tired of – yeah.  Right.  And your ass.  Not mine.  Mine is fine.  And I picked a doctor for his credentials.  You should go in first and see if he's like, yeah, it's LaMotta.  You know?  It's so true.  It's so true.  I want a little pencil finger guy.  Knock your pencil finger.  A midget.  Find a midget doctor.  Did you – have you had it?  No, not yet. 
[02:59:30]  Please do it.  Please, please, please.  I'm only 27, though, so.  It doesn't – these days, it doesn't matter.  Yeah.  I'm going soon, actually.  My youngest – my youngest friend who has had it was 25.  Oh, boy.  Oh, what's the symptoms?  I don't know.  That's why you have to go in and get a PSA check.  I really don't know.  But Patrice was just talking about how ugly his ass is.  You know what?  I think it's okay.  I think it's okay.  As long as you don't ask anybody to kiss it, it should be fine.  But a doctor is going to really not like – that's got to be a bad day for a proctologist.  I didn't say my asshole saying – 
[03:00:00]  What's ugly – I said my ass cheeks.  When you come in for a prostate exam, that's got to be like a bad day for a doctor.  Well, man.  No, not really.  Not if it's clean.  I'm just saying.  I just wanted to know the symptoms.  Please, just go get it.  Please go get it.  Frequent urination and things like that.  I think that's a large prostate.  I think it's hard, too.  But you need to go and look.  You made me go.  We flew back from L.A. one time, and I pissed so much.  He's like, you should be checked for diabetes.  He panicked me.  I went and – I've been checked like three times since I've been for diabetes. 
[03:00:30]  You're a hypochondriac.  No, I just pee a lot.  I am, too, though.  I can't watch House, that goddamn show.  It started as a hangnail.  House now has to kill three babies to save one.  What?  What the hell?  What did he – I got that.  Can everybody that has a problem with you guys now come in to the station to apologize?  Yeah, because we are pussies in that way.  Can Jim Kerr come in and say, hey, we don't even know what he does.  Richard Huff.  I just threw that name out.  He just started throwing that out.  Richard Huff is a writer that wrote the story about us in the Daily News this morning. 
[03:01:00]  We had a problem with him.  He bashed the pests in our show and stuff a little bit.  Had a problem with him.  Got him on the phone.  By the end of the conversation –  He was best friends.  Pals.  We can't stand what people can fuck up.  So the secret is don't meet anybody because that's the way it is.  Lock the doors for now on.  Whoopi Goldberg, let's be honest here.  She's – okay, she's been around ever since around the world in 80 motherfucking days.  The whole story.  You understand?  So when you see her, she becomes real. 
[03:01:30]  Just like if Mel Gibson with his goofy face and his Jew remarks comes in here, you could  not bash him like you do on the radio.  Oh, you know.  That Nuremberg trial thing really was a little over John Mel.  I don't understand.  Hey, I agree with you.  You know.  I feel the same way about those Jews in there.  He was just annexing what was his.  We're going to have to lock the doors for now on.  You can't have – it happens.  No matter who comes in, you can't just go, oh, now you're here, motherfucking Whoopi. 
[03:02:00]  Right.  What was with that tag dancing shit motherfucking years ago?  You got to come in here and you just – I just bring it up, old shit.  I know.  I know.  I know.  What happened – is it – let me – can I ask you a question?  Maybe.  Did you say it or what – are you – do you have a problem with Oprah?  No.  I've never had an Oprah.  What did I read about Oprah not inviting you to something?  Some – a big woman thing?  And you was upset or somebody thought you was upset?  No, people – no, people keep asking me how come you're not there. 
[03:02:30]  I keep saying because it's her thing and she didn't invite me.  That's okay with – you know, if you – if it's your party, I can't be pissed off  if she didn't invite me to your party.  But you know her for – I mean –  No, I don't.  Now, here's the thing.  The color purple.  All black people don't know each other.  Yeah, but that was 21 years ago.  We don't hang up.  We don't hang out.  It's – you know, it's just we're not – we're not – we're acquaintances,  very, very mild acquaintances.  So, no, it's not something that I'm part of with her and it's cool. 
[03:03:00]  It wasn't her party for, like, very influential or powerful black women.  Wasn't that the theme of it?  Mm-hmm.  Well, then, I mean, even if you're not close anymore, I mean, you certainly fit into that list.  I mean –  Well, perhaps I do.  And when she gets around to her list and she changes it, I guess I'll get the invitation.  Will you go?  Um, I don't know.  Good, good.  That's good.  Whoopi has no idea what she has started.  The pests are going to turn on us today as soon as she leaves.  I know.  Now we're going to get the wrath.  You're kissing her ass.  We're going to get the wrath.  Oh, please.  What's up with you pests? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Pests get a life.  Be nice.  You've been mean to me.  Wait, wait.  No, I've got to talk to the pests.  I've got to talk to the hand.  Listen, listen.  It's like Mongo.  Don't shoot him.  You'll just make him mad.  Don't do it.  Pests, you have been doing some mean stuff to me down around the building that I'm in.  There's no reason for y'all to walk up on me the way that you have.  Did they?  No reason at all.  So, Pests, I don't mind.  I like the boys.  The boys, they're doing what they're doing.  But y'all don't have to scare – physically scare me. 
[03:04:00]  There's no reason for it.  Don't physically scare, Whoopi.  I've been telling you guys for three days to knock this off and to just let other people  do their show.  They don't listen because they want to be in the paper and it's hurtful.  Jimmy?  Hey, Whoopi, could you thank us tomorrow?  Yeah, because we –  Absolutely.  For the last three days, we gave you a lot of attention on New York radio.  And I think a thank you is in order.  Didn't you hear me say good morning to you?  Because even negative publicity is good.  You know that.  No, it's not.  Sure, it's not. 
[03:04:30]  Bad publicity is good.  Any publicity – that's what they told me when I read ONA fired on the cover of the  paper.  It's like, yeah, that's good.  Will you thank us tomorrow on your show?  I will.  I will.  Absolutely.  Can I give you all my best and tell you thanks for making it at least fun?  Thank you so much.  Absolutely, Whoopi.  And I'll see you.  Can I come back sometime?  Yeah.  You can absolutely come back.  Do you mind, though, a couple times if you hit on a subject?  Can we just kind of talk about it a little bit?  Please do.  If we're nice.  Please do.  No, and even if you're tearing it to shreds, it's cool. 
[03:05:00]  It's cool.  Thanks for showing the rest of the country that we're a bunch of pussies.  We really are shit talkers anonymously.  We're just cowards.  We get behind the screen door with our mother and yell something and then hide.  I'm just sissy.  I saw her coming toward the door and I just went.  That's what they want you to think, y'all out there.  Can we get a quick picture?  They were happy to see me.  Absolutely.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We're taking a picture with our new friend.  Deal with it, shithead.  Whoopi Goldberg is doing mornings up against us on WKTU here in New York City. 
[03:05:30]  Thanks, Whoopi.  Thank you.  We'll continue.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of Whoopi and Anthony.  So sit back, relax, have yourself some herbal tea, close your eyes, and drift away with O&A.  Hey, ass cop.  Hi.  This is great.  You dick.  Bye, I, I, I, shut up, shut up. 
[03:06:00]  Fuck all y'all.  Horrific and tasteless.  It's called sarcasm.  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are.  And that's why I'm signing up.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  This radio show is getting weirder and weirder by the day. 
[03:06:30]  You guys are pussies.  Oh, we're going to have to go.  We're going to have to take a beating now.  The fans will understand.  Yeah, let's see what happens here.  Let's go to Howard in Wisconsin.  Howard, what's up?  Oh, I think we got to help out Whoopi by having Jimmy go in for a prostate exam.  You know, I'm scared as heck to do it.  And if Jimmy did it, then I think a lot of other guys would probably go out and do it, too.  Could save some lives, Jimmy. 
[03:07:00]  Jim, could save some lives.  Could you do it live on the show?  I wouldn't care.  It's hack radio, but it could be funny.  Yeah, I guess it could be.  If observing from a fucking safe seat with your trousers up.  You certainly couldn't.  We'll have curtains and stuff.  You know what I'm saying?  You should have had a tape recorder on me a year ago.  Really?  Oh, the sound I made.  Oh.  That's what they lubed the finger up.  I actually did have that last year.  You did?  Yeah, I fished around in there.  It's fine.  I'm going to shit.  Oh, no, I'm not.  You don't think anything? 
[03:07:30]  No.  Like, it's not like painful.  It is a little painful.  But I also had a...  What do they call...  You know, when they shoot water up your ass to fucking get logs to come out?  High colonics, man.  And they feel...  The first time you get it, the tube's a little too wide for your asshole.  Oh, gosh.  But the thin ones after that.  Hey, we're going off topic, though.  These guys really want to kill us for a while.  They want to kill us, and we'll allow you.  They're not going to kill us.  They understand completely.  Oh, sure they do.  The fans understand.  Rita.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Welcome aboard.  What's up, Rita? 
[03:08:00]  Hi.  Hi.  I'm very disappointed in you guys, thinking you could trick us.  What?  Why?  Because you move Patrice to the other side of the studio.  You have an extra microphone sitting there.  I was all excited when she came in.  I thought you were going to shit your pants.  It was hysterical.  And then I thought about it.  I said, wait a minute.  They knew she was coming the whole time.  No, we didn't know she was coming the whole time.  I had no idea she was coming.  Norton had absolutely no idea.  No idea.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Actually, I wanted to send you guys.  I thought that was super cool for her to come in and face you guys like that.  Unlike Hoo-Hoo, who's just sitting in his little booth and let's say a word. 
[03:08:30]  Like Jimmy said, though, that's what comics do.  She's a comic, so.  Even on her show when we were beating her up and giving her shit, the name was Opie and  Anthony came up and she was like, well, what guys?  What are we dealing with here?  She wanted to kind of just address it on the air.  That's what pretty much a stand-up does.  If we don't have an enemy, this show is screwed.  We got to keep on.  She did say we can still goof on our show, which is very goofable.  She just wanted the pest to leave her alone as far as waiting for her and all that. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, don't approach her outside.  Don't scare her.  Just a hell of a...  You don't go up to her.  We're hearing stories that some pests actually went right up to her.  And they probably...  And here's the thing with the pests.  They probably weren't being threatening.  They were just being themselves and doing their silly stuff.  Which is threatening.  But she's never dealt with that.  Other radio guys would probably go, hey, shut up, because they're used to it.  She said they walked up very close to her, but it was probably just their big guts  were so close to her and the face was about five feet away.  Yeah.  We're going to roll through these calls as fast as possible. 
[03:09:30]  Bruce in Louisiana, go.  Yeah, I was just going to say you made up with Tommy Lee.  You made up with Whoopi.  Why don't you just go ahead on Letterman and make up with Stern live there on the 31st?  I said he's being a bit sarcastic, not healing.  All right.  Let's go to Doug out, Doug.  Doug.  That was something that none of the other enemies have ever had the balls to do.  That was something you've got to respect about Whoopi.  Look at Doug.  You magnificent bastard.  I read your book. 
[03:10:00]  I didn't even believe that she was in there until I brought the Palpaw camera up.  I thought it was just a complete scam.  Nope.  Jimmy's face.  When Jimmy turned around, priceless.  I turned to the right, but I saw Elo, who is, by the way, wearing the fucking, it could  be the worst shirt ever made in any time period.  Elo's kind of known now for his bad shirts because he's on Pal Talk a lot and people goof  on his shirts.  It's unbearably awful.  But I saw him walk by.  And she already sat down by the time I realized she was here. 
[03:10:30]  I had no idea she was sitting next to me.  It's like a little house on the prairie picnic blanket.  Yeah, but yet it makes you nauseous when he walks by.  Bam and I were just talking last night about sending her a fruit basket full of bananas.  I don't know.  See, you're awful people.  Awful people.  Yeah, now do something nice for her.  Yeah, she was...  The pets can do something nice every once in a while.  It was amazing that she came in.  The fact that she came in, look, if she came in and started trying to confront us, even  if she brought people or something, I know, first of all, Opie would have been the first 
[03:11:00]  one, shut up, shut the fuck up, shut up.  You know, she came in, was civil, just sat there and, you know, confronted the problem.  What then are we supposed to do?  If you're going to bash us, that's fine.  And if we're having no balls, fine.  But I want to know what they would have liked to have seen us do.  This show is special.  I'll tell you why.  Like retarded?  No, it's special.  Like silver, everyone gets a gold medal?  Special.  Because unlike other shows, from time to time, we don't mind eating our balls and allow 
[03:11:30]  you...  Or each other's.  That's right.  Jim?  And allow you to listen to us getting our balls eaten.  Mm-hmm.  It happens.  At times, that is great radio.  That's true.  It doesn't always have to be, oh, yeah.  Like Sarah Jessica Parker, she put us in our place back in the day.  And we have no problem admitting it from time to time.  Yeah.  We'll have to eat our balls.  William Donahue called in, and we wound up getting along with him.  And there's nobody I hated more than William Donahue.  And all of a sudden, he calls in, and he's cool, and you get along. 
[03:12:00]  All the shows will not allow you to listen as they get their balls eaten.  That's a big difference right there.  Let's go to Richie in Bayside.  Richie.  I picture the biker scene in The Bronx Tale, all using chaps.  Jimmy right behind you.  She teabags you.  And you all go to the parade after.  All right.  Let's go to Cigars and Scotch.  Hey, I hear how he's going to fire up the chopper, cut his vacation short, and make an appearance in studio.  Yeah.  I don't think that's going to happen. 
[03:12:30]  Let's go to Joanne in New York.  Too much personal shit there to, like, you know, give a fine how-do-you-do to Howard.  Yeah.  Phone, Elo.  We didn't know Whoopi from a hole in the wall.  I didn't know anything personal about Whoopi.  I still don't know anything about her.  We just knew that listening to our show was, uh, it stunk.  We didn't like what we heard.  It's not meant for us.  It's fun to goof on.  And that's what we did.  Let's say hi to Joanne.  Hi. 
[03:13:00]  What's up, Joanne?  Hi.  Hey, guys.  You let her kick your ass.  Yeah.  Yeah, good for Whoopi, though, man.  I mean, I'm a fan of both of you, and she did.  She kicked your ass.  The fact that she had the balls just to walk in and sit down, and she wasn't nervous.  No.  She just sat down and fucking-  She hosted the Oscars, I think, right?  Yeah.  She's great.  She's great.  Fucking five dummies in the studio isn't very intimidating when you hosted it.  It was a great show today.  And the pictures we took will be up on opianthony.com.  I'll be looking, man.  Hey, uh, did Sam get the video as she was walking in? 
[03:13:30]  I-  Or he didn't know, right?  Of course not.  Or did he know?  Did he-  You didn't get the video as she was walking in?  Because no one-  He's not going to stab another black person in the back like that.  No?  Or videotaping them.  I got the commotion, not as she was-  I was right behind her.  I grabbed the camera as soon as I saw her through the door.  All right, so you got some stuff.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  You were right behind her as she was walking in?  Yeah, I grabbed the camera.  Oh, that's good enough, man.  If there were more people like you, L.A. wouldn't have burnt down about 15 years ago.  You didn't get her as she was in the cab coming from-  Yeah, all right.  Well, the video- 
[03:14:00]  Or Sam doesn't know.  He's just struggling internally.  The video and the pictures will be up on opianthony.com.  Eric is working on that right now.  Let's say hi to Dan in California.  Dan.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Hi, Dan.  I think that was pretty cool, but how long did you guys know about it?  Honestly, God, I-  Ramon!  He doesn't care.  Chuck in Indiana.  God, that must be awful if you're not a fan of the show to get Ramon.  Chuck.  Hey, I want to say hi to the new wise guys on XM. 
[03:14:30]  Three big pussies in the studio.  You ass.  That ain't bad.  What's up?  She treated us like a couple of brashals.  We got-  I felt like a big-  I love to do.  We got Tyra Banks checking in.  Yes, Tyra?  Dude, I was wondering why Whoopi didn't mention me.  Tyra?  Because everything isn't always about Tyra.  Yeah.  Well, this was, and I want to know when I can come in.  Well, we love your show.  Love what you do, Tyra. 
[03:15:00]  Come in any time.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Hey, guys.  As our previous caller said yesterday, Tommy Lee.  Today, Whoopi, guys, it's becoming quirky Opie and Anthony.  Shwoogie, you know we love your voice, right?  I know.  You add a lot of great stuff to the Opie and Anthony show, but I can't get the visual out  of my brain that you might be nine feet tall.  No, no.  I'm about 6'2", about 260.  260.  That's what I weighed in the second grade.  I have a big, tall guy. 
[03:15:30]  I have a glandular problem.  It's a, what do they call that?  Pituitary gland.  Normally proportioned.  Normally proportioned.  That's good.  I could palm a Volkswagen.  But no.  All right.  He doesn't want to be goofed on.  Let's go to Leprechaun.  First, second, and now her.  I'm running out of people to hate, man.  What are you going to do?  We're going to Carrot Top next.  You know what we're going to have to do?  Jimmy likes Carrot Top.  I like Carrot Top.  I don't know if I did.  I was there when he did Tough Crowd.  He was a fucking funny dude.  A couple of instant feedbacks coming in. 
[03:16:00]  Patrice, how can you hang out in the studio with so many bitches?  You were the only one that proved you were a man.  It's just, well, I explained it to him, what it was.  When you don't see him, it's a different thing, man.  You've got to be in their face.  You've got to be up in their grill.  We need to get a list of new people to hate because we're running out.  Fan.  We made good with Tommy Lee yesterday.  Let's attack fan.  We made good with Tommy Lee yesterday and now Whoopi today.  This is not good.  This is not good for the show.  And it's always you.  You called Tommy Lee a pussy. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  We had to deal with that.  And then you called Whoopi a bitch.  Yeah.  Had to deal with that.  Yeah.  And they come in.  But this does just go to show, though.  Like, a lot of, we are just faggots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  The phones are still just lit.  Greg in Georgia.  Greg.  Boys.  The virus is spreading down in Georgia.  I love you, man.  What?  Pretty cool the way y'all handled Whoopi, man.  That was all right.  Handled her.  She handled us.  Yeah.  That's good.  She smacked our stupid faces when we said we loved you in Sister Act. 
[03:17:00]  Let's go to Joe in New York.  Joe.  I will not go that far.  Hey, guys.  Got to give you credit for eating your balls.  And I got to give her credit for coming up there.  I thought we were going to have a hot 97 East Coast, West Coast blowout there.  Yeah.  She was threatening to tinkle on our children.  And then she realized we didn't have any.  All right.  Let's go to Scott in Modesto.  Scott.  Tara Reid.  Hey, guys.  I just want to make sure I'm still coming in tomorrow at 9. 
[03:17:30]  Tara, we loved your show.  You're welcome to come in.  Oh, great.  Wild on.  Wild on.  All right.  Wild on.  Brand new respect for Whoopi coming through the instant feedback here.  Tara from Rochester.  Fuck the naysayers.  She had balls of steel to come into the studio like that and talk to you guys.  And just because you treated her with respect doesn't mean you're pussies.  You threw the gauntlet down as she responded.  And it was great radio.  ONA from Pittsburgh.  I don't get it.  You bitched about how shitty she was at radio.  When she came in, you swallowed her fat cock and loved it. 
[03:18:00]  Jesus.  That's accurate.  Sounds like someone we know.  We beat her up a little bit.  We took a couple jabs.  I didn't.  A couple soft jabs.  I put my arms on my side and stuck my weak chin out and said, go on.  Slug it.  We had foamy, like, boxing gloves on.  They were like little rascals boxing jabs.  Big A shoes on our hands.  Well, Joe from FullBlownAids.com, a great fan site.  I guess if Howard shows up in the studio, y'all would blow him. 
[03:18:30]  Fucking pathetic.  I'm done, pussies.  Oh, that's it.  We lost the listener.  Bye, Joe.  Bye, Joe.  Take care, Joe.  We hardly knew ye.  Rick from Rhode Island.  I think you guys are more afraid of what happens when she leaves.  It's like Frankenstein realizing his monster has turned on him.  Jason from Missouri.  You guys deserve a thank you.  You folded like a house of cards, you lame fuckers.  Let's say hi to Steve the Whistler.  Steve.  Guys, I was wondering when I could not come in for my apology.  And finally, Jason in Ohio. 
[03:19:00]  Jason.  Hey, guys.  I've got to give you props, Opie.  You're going to make her, first you made her apologize, and then you're going to make her  thank you guys tomorrow on the air.  All right, that slipped past now.  A lot of people aren't recognizing the fact that even though we were pussies, that Opie  did make her apologize, like he always does to people that do not have to, shouldn't  be apologizing.  And thank you.  And in fairness to me, I did point out that this show had poked thunder. 
[03:19:30]  Wow, Jimmy.  You really did go out on a limb there, Jimmy.  I don't fuck around.  I'm not starstruck, ever.  Tony Danza.  Tony.  Thought you said, I'm coming in on Monday.  All right.  Guys got to say, love the show.  Liked how you goofed on me and all.  Oh, Tony, we think you're great.  You're wonderful.  Yeah, dude, they fucked you.  Could you sing a little bit?  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll regroup, get into something.  And as I look outside, I see hysterical comedian Dustin Diamond. 
[03:20:00]  You might know him as Screech.  He'll be working his way in.  There's a big cock on the table.  Oh, God.  What happened?  That is the only way we should have played it.  Who would want to be fucking nasty to her when she came in?  It's like, you don't feel nasty.  Why force us to be great?  I don't know how you would do that.  What is it?  Like, you fucking suck so bad.  Get the fuck out of here.  You don't deserve to even be in our studio.  Like, is that it?  No. 
[03:20:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's not the way I am.  Well, because it's not personal.  Yeah.  It's a business attack.  It's just like you say.  It's not even a business attack because she is going for a completely different audience.  Yeah.  We just find things that goof on.  And sometimes it's because we really hate the person.  Other times it's because it's just bad radio.  You don't ever hate any person.  What person do you really hate except for?  Man Cow and Howard are two people that, like, it's personal.  But no one else is.  Like, Whoopi, if you don't know Whoopi, you're just trashing her because she's on the show.  I know Whoopi, yeah. 
[03:21:00]  She comes in, it's like, hi.  And you're like, holy shit.  You've been fans of her goofy movies.  Yeah.  Super Cop and Cop 3.  Well, well.  What?  Ghost?  Neglect Lawyer.  Well, she wasn't.  Let's go to Donahue in Philly.  Donahue.  Yo, last time I heard you guys shit your pants like that, you thought Bernie Getz was going for  his gun.  Bernie Getz.  We really did think he was going for a gun that day.  We didn't shit our pants.  We were, like.  He ran out of here when we pissed him off.  Taking a bath.  We, you, we were being nice to him. 
[03:21:30]  You broke his CD, he thought.  Oh.  Me.  We.  Great.  It's always me, right?  But gotta give her credit.  She did do her shit.  Yeah, she came in.  He ran out and there's some kind of, like, briefcase thing he brought with him and he started  reaching in there like he thought he had a gun that he could use.  We did call her out on her shitty show.  Someone's saying you didn't call her out on her shitty show.  We didn't use that language.  Yeah.  Didn't say it was a shitty show.  We said something like, yeah, well, you know, different, different strokes, different folks.  Different folks.  It's kind of the same thing.  All right.  We're going to regroup.  We'll continue with Patrice O'Neill. 
[03:22:00]  We're leaving for Boston right after the show.  We'll be broadcasting live from WBCN tomorrow.  Patrice O'Neill, of course, part of the ONA Traveling Virus.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  Are you disgusted, Patrice?  O'Neill.com has all the info on our ONA Traveling Virus.  Done.  Done with us.  Saturday at the DCU Center in Worcester.  And lots of tickets to give away outside BCN tomorrow.  Life in corporate America can be a grind.  All they do is they remove the humor from everything. 
[03:22:30]  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem.  I'm standing here with this erection feeling silly.  You're going to need some sound advice.  Talk less and suck more.  From a qualified professional.  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts.  New from the Hiv Corporation.  It's the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Sensitivity training.  Maybe you can send someone from Human Resources in,  and they can tickle my bag a little.  I can go, ooh, very sensitive area.  And then they can leave.  Jim will help you construct a business plan.  Greed is good. 
[03:23:00]  He'll guide you through the hiring process.  Hire all fat chicks if you don't want them harassed.  He's also a whiz at customer relations.  Here's what you do, stupid.  When they complain, you go, click.  You take the phone.  Click.  Ladies will also enjoy Jim's wardrobe recommendations.  You send them to training to not have those big tits showing during the workday.  Jim is also an experienced marriage counselor.  How could you marry a chick that won't drink out of your mule?  And he can help men even the most fractured of family relationships.  I killed my wife with a hammer. 
[03:23:30]  And he'll also assist with time management.  130, Human Resources attempts to talk about sensitivity training.  135, they are wiping saliva that Jim Norton has spit on them off of themselves  as he walks outdoor.  End of meeting.  Call 1-800-LOG-DROP for the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Order today.  Meeting adjourned.  And this time we know what we're talking about. 
[03:24:00]  We blew it earlier.  I've been listening to the drums a lot more.  You know who's a great drummer, believe it or not?  It's a drummer from Motorhead.  Mickey.  Yeah.  That fucking little fat bastard is really good. 
[03:24:30]  Dave Grohl is one of those drummers that has a style that is identifiable.  Like, you know, guitar players have certain styles.  You hear a sound.  Like, if you hear, what's his name, from Queen.  Brian May.  Brian May.  You hear his guitar sound, you know it's Brian May.  Things like that.  Like, he's got a drum style that you just know it's him by the way he's playing.  And by the band that you listen to.  The guy's great.  All right. 
[03:25:00]  This is what we're going to do.  Big fan.  We have to leave at 11.  Don't worry.  We'll be here.  What time is it?  I don't feel like turning around.  It's 28 past the hour.  Ooh, got it.  Wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  It's 32 past the hour.  Is it?  I'm going with that clock.  My computer says 20.  I'll go with this clock, too.  Believe me.  Everyone's closest to me leaving.  Someone show me a clock that says 5 to 11.  I have too much to do today.  Because I'll buy that, too.  As we speak, Danny has hit the streets of New York with Big A.  Danny.  We are buying Big A shoes today. 
[03:25:30]  What's wrong?  Is it going to be like the stupid Christmas shoes song?  Is my stepfather, Sal, going to start crying?  Bro.  Make sure he gets that kid some good shoes.  They're buying shoes for Big A, bro.  I'm getting all choked up, bro.  The Christmas shoes.  Look, Big A was in line with his big meatloaf feet.  And he couldn't afford shoes. 
[03:26:00]  But then someone bought him shoes, bro.  It was almost Christmas.  Oh, Christmas shoes rose from Baltimore.  Oh, Baltimore.  Oh, my God.  You see, I think that's the, I think meatloaf is the perfect, that's exactly what they look like.  You want to just throw potatoes by his feet and see what happens?  Carve them up.  Damn, I would have said meatloaf. 
[03:26:30]  I couldn't, that's what was on the tip of my brain.  Meatloaf was exactly it.  Meatloaf.  Let's say hi to Dave in New York.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Welcome aboard, Dave.  Thanks for calling the program.  Do it, Dave.  Yeah, I'm aboard with Howard Stern here.  I just wanted to call and tell you guys, you guys are showing your true colors.  You guys are nothing but a bunch of cowards.  There's a buddy of mine who listens to XM, who I've been trying to switch him over to Sirius,  had talked me into listens for the last hour, hour and a half. 
[03:27:00]  Hold on, you've only listened to an hour?  You know, this is a fake cult.  Yeah, he's a fan.  I'm not even going to tell you.  Go ahead, you're found out.  Go ahead, say hi and how much you like us and where Jimmy's going to be.  Okay, I love you and I love you.  I watch it every Sunday.  Thanks, Louie.  You got me.  Dick bag.  Speaking of Lucky Louie, we should do the Spanish to, we can do that as well.  Oh, yeah.  They're still walking out with Big A.  We should have some audio.  Of course they are.  I love the fact that some Spanish guy has to listen to my nonsense translators. 
[03:27:30]  Hey, Jim, explain a little bit.  Well, I am on a program.  I'm rich on Lucky Louie.  HBO.  Sunday night.  Sunday's at 10.30 after Antiraj.  And they have the Spanish channel, which also shows Lucky Louie.  So they have, obviously, Spanish people.  A translator.  A español.  Yes.  And they have to translate some of my dialogue, which always makes me laugh that somebody has  to watch this idiocy and translate it.  And then translate it and try to sound like you. 
[03:28:00]  The same Jim inflection.  Inflection, right.  Anyone else notice that Jim's getting more scenes and more camera time as this series goes on?  Noticing.  Thank you to Carol.  We're all noticing.  By the way, I don't know if I brought it up.  During our big commercial shoot, Opie, when we filmed that, all I could think of is,  what do I do with my arms?  I've goofed on it so much with Jimmy that you stand there and go, all right, now what  the fuck do I do with my arms?  Can I tell you something?  I figured out something, though. 
[03:28:30]  I think you'll like it.  You'll like it.  Yeah.  Can I tell you something that's right down that alley as well?  I grab Opie's cock with him.  But why the homo stuff today?  And I'll tell you what I do.  It's every day.  It's just I'm trying to bring you into the fold.  You were talking about us sharing a room earlier.  I'm trying to bring you into more of the homo fold here because everybody else, we all  make gay jokes.  And for some reason, you're always out of the loop.  And by loop, I mean that tight leather one with a little hair around it.  And then just to tell you what I do with my arms when you're shooting a commercial, 
[03:29:00]  I fold them in front of me and put my head in them and cry.  All right.  It was one commercial with more on the way.  The next one, I swear to you, you could be a grip.  All right.  Listen, I have to have my pride and never do one.  Speaking of...  Speaking of hands, I saw Talladega Nights, the Will Ferrell movie.  It's really good.  I liked it a lot.  But there's a scene where he does the whole hand thing because he doesn't know what to 
[03:29:30]  do.  He's getting...  Really?  He's being interviewed for the first time after winning one of these races because  everyone knows he becomes this big NASCAR race driver that wins everything.  And then whatever.  Then the story goes from there, basically.  But he's being interviewed for the first time and he's got his hands up in front of his  face.  He doesn't know what to do.  The reporter starts pushing his hands down.  And that's pretty funny.  All I could think of was Jimmy.  I'm like, Jimmy, what do you do with your hand?  Will nailed this scene.  He nailed it.  Wait till you see it when it opens, I think, tomorrow.  Jim is good at a table, too. 
[03:30:00]  I like your hand gestures.  I'm the master of people.  You're very just kind of throwing those palms and fingers around.  I like that.  Yeah.  All right.  So Jim Norton, Lucky Louie, Sunday night, we do the English to Spanish thing because  on Spanish HBO, they show Lucky Louie and they get actors to do the voiceovers for  the original lines.  So we like to do this from time to time.  And this one should be really good because Jim Norton plays a retard and he's trying to  get a free slice of pizza.  He's playing like he's retarded. 
[03:30:30]  Not retarded on the show, though.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  No, just this scene.  Yeah.  He realizes if you play retarded, you get a free slice of pizza from this guy.  Brilliant.  So this is the original scene.  It's less than a minute.  And then we'll play the Spanish version.  Hey, what do you want to come here for?  I've never been to this place.  I come here sometimes.  They give me free pizza.  They do?  Why?  I make believe I'm retarded.  They give me a slice.  Watch. 
[03:31:00]  Excuse me.  Hello.  Are you my friend?  Oh, it's so nice to see you.  Here you go, pal.  Thank you.  You are nice persons.  That's disgusting.  I know.  Fucking people.  Give a guy a free slice just because he's retarded. 
[03:31:30]  The leadest assholes.  Like a slice of pizza is going to make my miserable, retard life any better.  Makes me sick.  There's the original scene.  For HBO, Espanol.  Same scene.  We all know that one. 
[03:32:00]  Hello.  It's getting ready.  It's getting ready.  It's getting ready.  Let's...  Let's...  Hello.  Hello.  How are you?  We're friends?  Hola, oye, qué gusto verte 
[03:32:30]  Aquí tienes, amigo  Gracias, ustedes son buenas personas  Qué simpático es, ¿no?  Eso es asqueroso  Ya sé, pinches mamones  Darle pizza a alguien solo por ser retrasado  Son unos pendejos  ¿Creen que una pinche pizza va a poder mejorar mi miserable vida?  Me provocan nausea 
[03:33:00]  I don't like the fact they're dubbing this wrong  Yeah, you can hear it  I'm taking my laughs out, these shitheads  Because I'm walking back and I laugh on the walk back  He didn't  No  I don't know what he did differently  What did he do differently?  I don't know, apparently he crawled back in an unfunny fashion  Fucking dirty Mexican, get my lines right  Was it you or your fact of picking fruit?  Me, but they dub it in  But they don't have a guy acting in  They just have him dubbing in, obviously  Yeah, dubbing in  But on my walk back  There's a pause there  And I go from retarded  And as soon as I face Louie and Mike 
[03:33:30]  I straighten up and act normal  That got a laugh  And in his version it didn't  So all these fucking Spanish people are watching  Thinking that I'm not funny in English  They're pulling back the laugh track  Maybe that type of humor doesn't relate to them  Oh, please  These fucking guys think it's hilarious  All they do  Fake mustaches are funny to them  Oh  Oh, play Espanol  Fucking dopes in the audience  You watch Brazilian TV  It's all puppets  Mucho hilaritio  Oh, it's awful  All right, here we go  Oh, Teehee  Oh, Danny's ready?  Shoot 
[03:34:00]  But after all that bashing  Let's bring in  The Spanish guy that dubs the voices for Jimmy  Here he is  We've got to think on our feet  What do we do?  What do we do?  All right, let's go to Danny  Danny  Hey, fellas  Hey  Hey, fellas  I'm here with Big A  We're in front of the shoe store  We're going to make our way in right now  What shoe store?  It's called Make 10  Oh, thank God you didn't pick Nike Town  Because that was real close to  I was going to, actually  I didn't think the mics would work inside, though  Thank God  I had to save some bucks  So here we are 
[03:34:30]  There's a wide selection of  I hope they're very wide  Sneakers  There's some sketchers and loafers  Loafers  What kind of shoes do you think Big A would look good in?  Meat loafers  One shaped like a pork roast  His feet  His shoes right now look like  You know the type of thing you have to wear on your feet  When you break your foot  To heal it  No, not an air cast  Yeah  One of those big, like, stupid  They call it a boot  They call it a boot  The boot  The boot  What music are they playing? 
[03:35:00]  I don't know  They just turned on some awful stuff  Jesus  It's the Christmas shoes, Roe  Probably James Blunt  It's in every store now  Is it?  Because it's safe music  Hey, Opie, good news  There's a $10 off sale  Oh, shoot  All right, Big A  Come on, start picking out some shoes here  Well, let's talk to Big A  What kind of shoes does Big A want?  Are there people there that help?  Yeah, you know what?  All right, have him sit down  I want him measured  And everything 
[03:35:30]  Okay, hang on  Because they got to get the shoe sales  He's got to pick the shoe first  And I want a circumference on that fat foot  Can we get some assistance, please?  Oh, very good  This man, Andrew  He's looking for some new shoes  Do you think  What would you suggest for this guy?  New shoes?  Do you want to ask me  If I'm mind being on camera first?  Oh, that's a good idea  Ghost  Do you want to be on the radio, Evan?  No, of course not  Of course you don't  No room, no  What's the name of that store, Danny?

Can we hear from Big A?  I don't know  Yes, I'm here  All right, are you excited about your shoes? 
[03:36:30]  Yes, really  What kind of shoes do you want to get?  Sketchers or black shoes that look like dress shoes  So you can wear them for a lot of different things  I guess black shoes  Black shoes  Spit it out, rain cloud feet  I guess black shoes  I would love if Big A called her a cunt  And then walked the nightclub out  She fucking fucked up everything 
[03:37:00]  She really brought it down  Because everybody's thinking of how much you want to curse that dumb spick out  I know  I'm going to be on camera  You fucking whore  Want to ask me if I'm going to be on camera?  All right  You know what, Big A?  Get a shoe and throw it  And then walk out  She's not used to it unless it's night vision  Show her that retard strength  Yeah  Well, just pet her hair in the barn  And then kill her  And cover her with a couple of little hay pieces  Get a couple of shoes and just bite them  Something tells me there'll be enough abuse 
[03:37:30]  When he finally slips one of his shoes off  Clears that place out  What's your feet look like, Big A?  Like a gas bomb  I think we should send Big A in for a fucking pedicure one time  And get that on the air  I guarantee his feet  Sting  Sting  Sting  All right  Sting  Pew  Where are we at?  Well, Big A's just staring at the shoes  He hasn't picked out a pair yet  Well, can you tell that Lumox  To fucking find a shoe?  Do they have nice shoes, A?
