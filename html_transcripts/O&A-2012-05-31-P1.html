<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting abruptly between them.  The show began with exaggerated, humorous introductions by Opie and Anthony (who arrived late), along with Jim Norton.  Norton recounted a bizarre dream involving a surprise pregnancy with a daughter fathered by a woman he disliked, considering adoption before deciding to raise the child.  This dream also featured a chaotic scene at a restaurant (possibly Kenny and Caroline's) involving a security incident with money and spilled coffee. He also shared a recurring dream about male friends wanting to perform oral sex on him, sparking a discussion about dreams and the anxieties of fatherhood, punctuated by Norton's crude humor. The conversation then turned to unsettling childhood experiences in Norton’s home, involving drug-using tenants, theft, attempted suicide, and a tenant's suicide on train tracks, leaving a note in Norton's childhood bedroom.

The hosts transitioned to criticizing New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposed ban on large sugary drinks, contrasting it with other city issues like high cab fares and commuting difficulties, particularly from Long Island to attend Islanders games. This segued into a discussion about healthcare costs, insurance, and the fairness of the healthcare system, including a caller detailing high family insurance costs. The hosts debated personal versus societal responsibility for health, and a call with James concluded this section, discussing racial profiling and legal inequality.

A subsequent segment focused on the precarious nature of health insurance in their early radio careers, moving into discussions of risky behavior and financial struggles, including a cash settlement for a fender bender.  The hosts criticized corporate greed, especially in banking and insurance, contrasting this with their perception of Apple's customer relations.  They discussed unfair banking practices, including low interest rates and overdraft fees, sharing personal anecdotes of financial hardship.  They then analyzed a *Today Show* segment featuring Kathy Lee Gifford and Marty Short, where Gifford unintentionally mentioned Short’s deceased wife, followed by a replay of Opie misidentifying Ice-T as "Ice Cue." The show ended this segment with a commercially produced jingle,  "Laugh your tears away," filled with insults and offensive language, along with mentions of a potential guest appearance by Thor and banter about co-host Eric's outspokenness during the "after show," and Roland's habit of wearing popular team t-shirts.

Another section featured Opie discussing absurd phrases from his songs ("nosy body," "retard brain," "get your own fucking life"), followed by audio clips.  The hosts played a clip of an Illinois state lawmaker's furious outburst about a pension bill, then several clips of Paul Anka angrily complaining about band members' shirts during a recording session. They then played a viral video of a child singing an anti-gay song in church, sparking discussion about religious indoctrination, parental responsibility, and hypocrisy within religious groups.  A caller shared their perspective on raising children with religious beliefs, leading to a debate about choosing a religion and the potential for indoctrination.  This segment also included further discussion of the Illinois lawmaker's outburst, an Ashley Madison advertisement, Mayor Bloomberg's soda ban, a TLC show about obese pregnant women, and a short audio clip of a child under anesthesia.  The "Ain't no homos" video, the father's pride, Kathy Ireland, and Star Wars collectibles were also discussed.

The final excerpt focused on Anthony Cumia's upcoming wedding, with discussions about large 7-Eleven drinks, potential increased revenue from legislation, and inappropriate wedding vows.  The conversation contained graphic sexual humor, including jokes about ejaculate, sexual acts, Anthony's father's reaction to his future daughter-in-law, and the creation of vulgar wedding vows. The hosts contemplated Anthony picking up women en route to his wedding and discussed Valerie Bertinelli's age and appearance.  The segment concluded with plans for a future show with Jim Norton, further punctuated by vulgar jokes and insults.  Roland was mentioned as possibly being in the studio for this section.

[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, we're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick crisis.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, we got to get this thing going.  Too much going on today, man.  Good morning to everybody.  Ant's on his way.  Where's Ant?  Anyone know where Ant is?  He'll be here.  A couple minutes soon?  All right.  What's up, Jimmy?  Oh, I'm tired.  You're tuckered out?  Yeah.  I woke up.  I'm asleep with my mouth guard.  I think I'm sleeping better.  I can't use the mask.  So Daphne masks I'm done with.  Rogan recommended the mouth guard, which you're done with the apnea mask. 
[00:02:00]  I think so.  I wake up.  Everyone has a different problem.  Like, I got one that just plugs into your nostrils and your nose is open.  Yeah.  And then it covers your mouth.  It's like a hybrid.  Yeah.  But I woke up with a drool in it.  That's got to smell bad, too, after a while.  Probably.  I think I woke up relatively quickly.  Yeah.  So I got the mouth guard, and I woke up, and I dreamt.  I had a weird dream.  I woke up that I was pregnant, and I was going to have a...  Like, I went to the doctor, and she confirmed.  Like, I thought it was cancer or something, but she told me I was pregnant, and I was going 
[00:02:30]  to have a baby.  And for some reason, I knew it was a daughter, but then I realized it was with a girl.  Right.  And I didn't like this girl.  I care about her.  Yeah.  And I felt bad that I was having a baby with a girl I didn't care about.  A dream, I hope.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely a dream.  I woke up to this this morning, and I just felt really weird.  Jimmy's pregnant. 
[00:03:00]  I'm like, will I keep it?  Will I not keep it?  Wait, you're pregnant.  Who's pregnant?  I was for a second in the dream, but then I'm like, then I knew it was a girl's.  And I'm like, do I keep it?  Do I not keep it?  But I was disappointed that I didn't care about the girl.  And I was envisioning myself holding a baby, and I'm like, uh...  Your baby?  That you deliver?  No, no, no.  That the girl did.  But you were pregnant.  For a second.  But now you're not pregnant.  Yeah, the girl is.  But now the girl's pregnant.  Yeah.  But you don't care about the girl.  No.  But you want to hold the baby that you were pregnant with for a second, but then she was  pregnant with.  Well, I was thinking that I would give the baby up for adoption. 
[00:03:30]  And then I was like, but what if I hold it and like it?  Then I'm like, you know what?  You're just going to have to spend half your money on the baby, and that's it.  You're going to have to do it.  It's like a Lifetime movie.  Dude, that's exactly what it is.  I resigned myself to the fact I was going to have to do that.  And then I dreamt that Kenny and Caroline scolded me, that I was at Caroline's, and we  were being held back by security because the money papers were being walked through.  And the security guard kind of pushed me, and I spilled hot coffee on myself. 
[00:04:00]  And I was like, come on, dude, what the fuck?  And then Kenny goes, get the hell out of here.  You don't talk like that here.  What is going on with you?  The Kenny and the manager of Caroline's.  What's the money papers?  I don't know.  They were big-legged papers the security guys were walking through.  Big, giant pieces of money?  No, I just knew it was important documents.  I dreamt my friends wanted to blow me.  Really?  Felt all bad.  I woke up and said, I'm a homo.  Which friends?  Hopefully not us.  Because we dreamt the same thing.  We actually awake dreamt it. 
[00:04:30]  I just kind of envisioned it.  By the way, the first thing I thought of when I woke up this morning, the first fucking thing  was, you're not smart, you're not funny, you're a retard.  It's the first thing I thought of.  And it just sticks in your head.  It's fucking horrible.  Did you really dream your friends wanted to blow you?  Yeah, occasionally.  Not even just once.  Which friends?  Like, over the years, it's been like, all of my friends, at certain times, have wanted 
[00:05:00]  to, like, blow me.  I don't know why.  Jimmy's sitting there like a psychiatrist.  That's very interesting.  With his finger against his cheek.  Why is that interesting?  His chin in his hand, his finger tapping his cheek.  Mm.  Yes.  Mm.  Mm.  Because it's, I've never...  My cock in his mouth.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  But then, why, that's, that's much more interesting.  I don't know, and then I wake up thinking like, uh, ew, ew, ew.  You know, it's like, ew.  You think your dad knows you dreamed that?  Uh, probably. 
[00:05:30]  He would not be happy in heaven.  He'd be like, I knew it.  He's a faggot.  He wouldn't be happy.  Oh, that Anthony.  What a faggot.  Did I do it good in the dream?  Jimmy would be all pissed that he didn't give me good head in my dream.  Who was the best?  Uh, let me think.  No, it never, ever gets to the point of actual head.  But it's like, it's leading up to it.  How is it leading up to it?  Weird.  I hope it's not a real scenario.  Like, wow, I'm drinking, we're in the jacuzzi, you're over talking about fucking the radio  show and gigs. 
[00:06:00]  What?  I give you a drink, there's a roofie in it.  No, it's just a weird thing.  It is, uh, like, uh...  But you can't commit.  No, no.  No, it can never, like, really dive in and delve into the finishing, uh, move.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's weird.  That is a little strange.  Yeah, it's odd.  But dreams are weird in general.  How close do we get?  Do we just slap it on our cheek a little bit?  Yeah, a little smack.  Thwock, thwock, thwock.  No, no, it never gets to the point.  And I don't believe dreams mean shit.  I'm not a fan of that crap. 
[00:06:30]  I go back and forth.  Why?  Because the randomness of them, sure.  What about the dreams you don't even remember?  You know how many dreams you had last night?  A lot, I'm sure.  So you remember the one dream and that means something?  Get the fuck out of here.  And how many dreams I break on a daily basis and ruined?  Um, I'm not saying it means anything, but it's your mind telling you something or it's  your mind working something out.  It doesn't have to mean anything in the overall picture of life.  It could just be what I'm concerned about or I'm thinking about.  Yeah.  So you're concerned about being pregnant yourself for a split second and then someone else 
[00:07:00]  has the baby?  I've thought about knocking chicks up and, like, what would that be?  Like, it's this intangible thing.  Like, oh, yeah, you'll get a girl pregnant.  And I have a condom every time, so it's not like, oh, that's right.  That's a great point.  So I have to worry about AIDS in my ass and a fucking, getting a girl pregnant.  Have some AIDS dreams.  Holy shit.  AIDS in my ass.  My fucking, my body is, what's it called, an actuary?  It's the fucking river meeting the ocean.  Yeah.  I worry about that. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Why would you take a chance getting a girl pregnant?  I don't get that shit.  Well, it's like anything else.  I don't get that, man.  Why do people drive after you drink?  That used to scare the shit out of me.  Roll the dice.  It should.  I don't know.  No, I don't get the rolling the dice as far as that goes, especially because you guys  don't like kids at all.  Stop rolling, mate.  Oh.  Yeah.  It is odd.  You don't like kids at all as far as in your life, and you take that chance.  That's crazy.  I don't like losing at blackjack, but I bet.  That's true.  Crazy.  I don't like bobbing, but I perform.  One of these broads is going to go for it, man, because there's some ATM machines in this 
[00:08:00]  fucking room.  You're crazy.  Well, I mean, they have to get fucked first.  And then what are you going to do?  What am I going to do?  Just deal with it.  Yeah.  What can you do?  Attack it with a hammer?  Live with it.  Right?  Like they said in fucking The Mighty Quid, live with it.  Remember that?  That awful Denzel Washington movie?  Yeah.  I, um, I'm not.  That's a good dream, though.  It was just weird to be concerned about the kid.  I was concerned about the kid, and like, yeah, man, I would want to hold a kid. 
[00:08:30]  It was weird.  It was kind of like wanting to do it.  Oh, no, that's based on that stupid video you turned everyone on to.  Maybe.  Sure.  And based on the Eaton Patsa case.  Maybe.  From 1977.  That fucking creep.  79.  Yeah.  I tried to get him in 77.  He got away.  He wasn't there.  Yeah, it was only nine.  Oh, Christ.  What are they going to do?  Believe me?  It was nine.  I'm already making my list of people my kid has to stay away from.  Who's on your list?  A lot.  Half the people in this room.  Nah.  Who? 
[00:09:00]  Nah, not at all.  You just see them.  You just see them walking about, and you just know.  You just know.  Park people?  Nah.  Nah.  I think one of my doormen.  I think one of the security guys in my building.  The one that sells all the illegal ones?  Nah, he's cool.  Oh, okay.  I like the illegal ones, too.  He's too busy trying to get the latest movies illegally to touch a kid.  Oh.  I think one of the security guys, he comes up with the food people, and my kid looks at  him, and he's creeped out.  I think kids know.  Wow, the kid knows.  Yeah, yeah.  That's odd.  Other guys that come up, like, you know, security and doorman and shit, he's totally cool with 
[00:09:30]  high-fiving and give them the fist bump.  One of these guys, though, he doesn't want anything to do with.  And I have a feeling that's just something in their fucking DNA as little kids.  They just know.  An instinct, yeah.  I'm telling you, man.  Wow.  Fuck yeah.  It's creepy.  Yeah, it is.  I met somebody recently introduced by a friend who was going to do something for me, and I  got immediately my instincts went off.  I don't know why they raved about this guy, but there was something about it. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  It was dangerous.  I think that shit is accurate.  In what way?  Don't know.  I just immediately.  Wait, what were they doing for you?  What do you want to say?  No, it was nothing mine.  They were actually going to help me remove a couch from my...  It's a weird story, but I'm getting into a sofa.  Couch means body.  Yes.  That's the goal.  Right.  They were going to help me take a sofa out.  And it was the friend of a friend.  And it wasn't anything he said.  He seemed very pleasant, but there was something in the face or the instinct. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, you just know.  And I'm like, trust your instincts.  Yeah, you've got to follow that shit.  You've got to follow that shit.  That's creepy.  Yeah.  I just knew, don't interact with this person.  Don't let them do anything for you.  Did you ever find out anything about the guy?  No, because I haven't gotten to know.  I've only heard good things.  I haven't gotten the sofa yet, so it's going to be a while anyway.  Yeah.  But he came by and just looked at how would he take it apart and get it out of the apartment.  Right.  It was a stupid thing.  I mean...  I think that all the time.  Yes, do not interact with this person. 
[00:11:00]  Don't have them over.  Don't have them over.  Wow.  That's creepy.  Yeah.  That is weird.  That shit's real, though.  For the most part, that shit's real.  Your averages would be pretty good.  Well, I've heard many times, like, people who have bad things happen, like, why didn't  I just listen to myself?  I knew it.  I knew it, and yet I didn't listen to myself, and I'm going to listen to myself this time.  My dad trusted everyone.  It was exhausting.  The complete opposite of me.  He trusted everyone. 
[00:11:30]  Everyone.  And then they started having tenants in our big house when we started leaving, and these  guys would steal everything.  Oh, my God.  They would use our little cereal spoons that I remember when I was fucking eight, nine,  ten years old, to fucking smoke crack in their rooms.  The handle was curled up.  Oh, it was all burnt.  You're eating cereal with heroin-curled spoons.  In all fairness, I was older, and I was out of the house, but I would come back, you know,  here and there, and, oh, let me grab a spoon, because I'm going to go old school and have 
[00:12:00]  a bowl of cereal.  And you see the burnt marks at the bottom of the spoon.  My Cheerios taste like soot.  Right.  I would go in my old room, and there'd be burn marks on the rugs and shit.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Will you stop trusting everybody?  Oh, that's brutal.  My brother, who was six years, well, who is six years younger than me, he had brand new  bicycles that he saved up for, and they were stolen so the guy could buy drugs.  Then another lady tried to commit suicide in the fucking woods. 
[00:12:30]  I'm like, why are you trusting everyone and trying to take care of everybody?  Enough already.  Was there resentment there after, like, thinking about that?  No.  Was a kid like, oh, God.  I wasn't really a kid at that point, because I was the first out of the house.  Take care of your own offspring.  My dad ran a basketball program, a really good community basketball program that, you  know, a lot of the guys my age still look at, like, wow, it was a really nice thing your  dad did.  But he would hire guys he would meet at bars and stuff that were old Vietnam vets that 
[00:13:00]  needed a break.  Like, so now you got drunk fucking referees and shit.  And then as a little kid, you're, like, waiting for the game to start, but there's no game  tonight because the ref is too drunk to come.  Can't have any kids named Charlie.  Right.  They freak out.  It was just exhausting, because my dad wanted to help and trust everybody.  Everybody.  It's such a weird thing.  It's a good-natured thing to want to do. 
[00:13:30]  Of course.  But you're also thinking, like, stop.  Enough already.  You can't help everybody.  Don't trust people.  No.  That's why I don't trust anybody.  I keep to myself.  It was exhausting.  Brutal.  Those are the ones I remember.  Wow.  Oh, and then another guy.  That's right.  Oh, no.  He fucking committed suicide at the train tracks in Greenlawn.  That guy lived in my house.  In my room.  Did he jump?  Yeah.  He left a note in my fucking childhood room that he was killing himself. 
[00:14:00]  What did he say?  Did I ever tell this story on the air?  Oh, my God.  I can't take this anymore, O.P.  Oh, I was long gone.  And my dad was gone.  This was after he died, but my dad was the guy that brought him into the house.  And he lived there for years, and one day my mom goes up there and sees a suicide note.  Wow.  You can look it up.  The guy fucking parked his car on the tracks in Greenlawn and killed himself. 
[00:14:30]  That guy lived in my house.  For what?  The police came.  Actually, the police came over to my house because I think the suicide note.  I'm trying to remember the story.  Had an address on it?  I think the suicide note was on the windshield or in the car or on him.  And then they went to my house, and there were more suicide notes and shit.  Wow.  What did he say?  And he was another fucking vet guy that was having problems.  Oh, yeah.  That's brutal.  Yeah, it is.  Holy shit.  Of course it is.  Wow.  He was a nice guy, I remember. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  He was a nice guy.  But then you wonder, fuck, how close was he to taking everyone out?  True.  Do you know what great news that would be, though, if you had wanted your old room back and  couldn't get it?  And all of a sudden you'd come home and find the note?  No.  Well, you know, lemons, lemonade, you know the story.  I mean, you know, that's years after I left the house, but still, it was continuing right  up to, you know, right up until a few years ago, even though my dad's been gone.  Before the cops even put two and two together, you're moving furniture out. 
[00:15:30]  All right, he's gone.  Yeah, he's a note, I think.  Fingerprints were all over.  Yeah, it was on the tracks in Greenlawn, man.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's brutal.  Oh, fuck.  Well, they took a lot of, like, troubled people in.  All the time, man.  All the time.  All the time.  I'm sure a lot of people appreciate it and fucking, you know, turn their lives around,  but there were stories left and fucking right.  Suicide girl, drug, a couple drug people, the one drug guy stealing everything, and they're 
[00:16:00]  like, well, I don't know, maybe you just misplaced it.  No, the fucking guy's stealing shit.  How about we kick him out?  How bad do you need the stupid 200 bucks a month or whatever it was?  You had a thing, because you never, like, talk about stories of wealth and all these wonderful  times as a kid as far as having everything.  We had no money.  Like, you must have thought, like, why are you doing this instead of taking care of your,  like, birth kids? 
[00:16:30]  Jesus.  Well, they were taking the money in to pay the fucking bills.  I mean, we grew up in a really big house.  Uh, I don't know, six, seven rooms, six, six rooms, probably.  So when we were leaving, they're like, ah, we'll just bring a tenant in.  So my dad, you know, wasn't making a lot of money.  I bet suicide guy was late on his payments.  Suicide guy.  Come on now.  I bet he wasn't really prompt.  I would have to ask my brothers.  My brothers are listening.  If they want to add to this, that'd be wonderful. 
[00:17:00]  Suicide guy.  No, I think he was a good tenant, actually.  Really?  I think he paid his bills.  I think he was paid off.  I bet he missed the last one.  Come on.  He had to.  Then we got a grieving family coming over to my family house to get his possessions.  I'm like, what?  How depressing.  Why are we part of this?  Yeah, why do you got to put up with that shit?  I know this shit happens.  But Jesus.  But we invited into our home?  Yeah.  Why?  Wow, that's brutal.  Supposedly, my brother was, I'm trying to remember how old he was, he was helping the 
[00:17:30]  fucking dead girl in the woods.  I mean, they brought her back to life, but she was well into her suicide.  The dead girl in the woods.  Well, I mean, she was well into her suicide when my brother came upon her.  I mean, what is with this kill yourself fucking tenant shit?  We were able to save that one because my brother found her in time.  Wow.  But she was well into her suicide.  Holy mother of God. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  That's brutal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's a weird fucking...  But my dad was just trusting.  He just fucking wanted to help the world.  That's why I came up with the whole baby turtle thing.  Fucking let some of these people die like baby turtles.  The nature understands, you know, you got a fucking hundred baby turtles that are hatched  and not all of them are going to make it to the ocean.  They just know that.  Some of them walk the wrong way.  Yeah.  Go up to the dunes.  There's way more stories.  Those are the ones I remember. 
[00:18:30]  And plus, I tapped out of family life for a while, so I was gone for years at a time.  You'd think there'd be an investigation.  You'd think there would have been an investigation.  Like, too many people are dying over there at the Hughes house.  It was unbelievable, man.  Like, suicide guy, car crashes in front of the house all the time.  Wow, man.  Yeah.  That's why I got this tough outer layer, I think.  I've seen some shit.  You're a war veteran.  I've seen some shit. 
[00:19:00]  Like, post-traumatic stress.  I don't know why this stuff is coming out lately.  Holy shit.  I forgot about suicide guy.  I think we mentioned it, though, because that was a few years ago now.  That was about three, maybe three, four years ago now.  That's something.  Wow.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Oof.  Anyway, good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  Hey, good morning, everyone.  I had to turn off my Twitter yesterday.  I was getting killed with this Ice-T Ice Cube thing.  What?  Hilarious.  Everyone I talked to was like, that was so goddamn funny. 
[00:19:30]  I know.  I didn't turn off my Twitter.  I'm just fucking around.  But that was a classic fucking moment.  That was the Adam Walsh, John Walsh moment.  I know there's no way for me to get out of that one.  Yeah.  But there's so much going on with that clip.  I do want to keep selling it that way.  There are plenty of moments.  Because Jimmy's over-the-top excitement that we might have Ice-T in studio for a few minutes.  And then my massive faux pas.  And then Jimmy's complete disgust.  He just turned around. 
[00:20:00]  Disgust.  In one word, he just goes, Ice-T.  Ice-T.  Ice-T.  Don't ruin my fucking celebrity friendship.  Yeah, he was personally embarrassed by that.  Yes.  Ice-T.  I have a movie script, huh?  If I got my brothers together, I absolutely...  You know, fuck writing about radio.  I think I got to write about my fucking upbringing, man.  Yeah.  Fuck the radio shit.  That shit's been done.  Who gives a fuck?  Who gives a fuck? 
[00:20:30]  Whatever was on the air, you heard it.  Yeah, exactly.  You heard it.  This is shit that never saw the light of day.  I'm hoping my brothers are up, because they'll add to this.  Or I'll call them during the break.  My brother Brett, owner of F.A. Trials, he would jump on this one easily.  Is that that place in Huntington?  Fucking easily.  I think it's there in Huntington.  Yeah.  I think they were palling around with one of the tenants, because they were about his age,  and the kid's just a drug dealer.  God.  My brothers didn't do drugs. 
[00:21:00]  Just probably the basic shit like most of us have done over the years.  I'm amazed there isn't, like, this resentment.  Like, I would be pissed.  Of course there's resentment.  God.  It was frustrating.  Crazy, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  You know, I blame it all on my fucking mom.  Oh, man.  Just pile more on.  Eh, whatever.  Oh, wow.  I don't care.  Eh.  I guess we all get that shit, but that seems like, uh...  I don't care. 
[00:21:30]  That's brutal.  Wow.  I mean it.  I don't care.  It's not this...  I don't care.  Anyway.  I don't care.  Me and Jimmy were talking just before you got in here, Ant, that this fucking Bloomberg's  got to, you know, stay out of our fucking lives.  He's very busy with interfering with everybody.  I was telling, there are major problems as far as New York City goes, people commuting  to New York City, people attempting to live in New York City, and this dope, this mayor 
[00:22:00]  of ours is concerned about sugary drinks.  Yeah.  There's a ban going, in effect, that you can't sell sugary drinks over 16 ounces in New York.  When is that starting?  Do you realize the cabs are going up again, and he ignores that?  I don't know what he could do.  I don't know this world.  But he ignores all this other shit and goes after sugary drinks?  Are you kidding me?  He can't buy a 32-ounce big bottle of pop, as they call it, pop.  But technically, he's like, he doesn't understand what the big deal is, because I guess you 
[00:22:30]  can go in and get two 16 ounces if you have to.  So why do it?  But those giant big gulps and shit are being banned.  That has nothing to do with being the mayor of a city, by the way.  It's disgusting.  Everything he does, by the way, he wants it to be guns.  But he can't because it's all right.  But he wants it to be guns.  I don't want soda.  I don't want guns.  I don't want people eating fatty foods and fries.  I mean guns. 
[00:23:00]  I don't want people driving cars.  I mean guns.  That's funny.  He's a nudge.  He's just a nudge.  He's another.  You can still buy cigarettes and beer in any size.  You can buy a giant beer, but not giant sodas.  Yes.  It's fucking nudge.  I don't know how many people drink soda and then plow into a family.  Or beat their wife.  Yeah, we got a lady that went right through a fucking house the other day.  Guess what?  She was drinking too much.  Wasn't soda.  Why isn't that motivating?  You stupid fuck.  A smaller beer sale.  He stinks. 
[00:23:30]  But do the average people understand how ridiculous this shit is?  Or is it just us and maybe a small group of our audience?  Two things you can't do in New York.  It's insane.  You can't go to a UFC fight and you can't drink a large soda.  Right.  But you can drink beer and buy cigarettes.  Bloomberg is an asshole.  He's an asshole.  For honor.  And I certainly don't want him banning cigarettes and beer.  But you're going after these dumb soft targets when real shit is going on out there.  The only reason, I'll say it again, I live in New York City is because I couldn't do that fucking commute anymore. 
[00:24:00]  There's a major problem with commuting from New York City to Long Island and these politicians just ignore it and don't want to acknowledge that it's happening.  You can't get in and out of this city easily anymore from Long Island.  And then if you're lucky enough to get in from Jersey or anywhere else, they're killing you with the tolls and everything else.  But he goes after sugary drinks.  Because he's a douchebag.  That's who gives a fuck shit.  Iraq's spray painting a protest sign, as we speak.  Loves his sugary drinks.  But you make a good point. 
[00:24:30]  You can drink until you're fucking silly.  They don't care about that.  They don't give a fuck.  Yeah, Bloomberg sucks.  It's the dumbest thing ever.  The million pound march.  Iraq's starting the million pound march.  Yeah, I hope he fucking drops dead while he's doing it.  Jesus, Chip.  Why would you say that?  Fuck him.  I'm a sucker.  It's just one guy.  Yeah.  He's very big.  Yeah.  But they're attempting to get the cab fares up again.  And I don't know how people afford this shit. 
[00:25:00]  Until he chases everybody out of New York City, he's not going to be happy.  Three million people have left New York.  Well, since when, though?  What was the day?  Three and a half million in the last ten years.  Yeah, three and a half million have said, fuck this place.  It just costs too much.  That says a lot.  Yeah, it's just too expensive.  It says a lot.  And everyone just ignores it.  And they continue to fucking raise the prices on everything.  I think they're raising the tolls for truck drivers, 45%, too, or something like that.  I think that was in the paper today.  It just never ends. 
[00:25:30]  And this stupid fucking mayor has a huge press conference over sugary drinks.  I don't like sugary drinks.  I definitely do not like the sugary drinks.  So I'm banning them.  Get me my bicycle.  Notice that he's banning sugary drinks and not salty ones.  Yeah.  How do you know that cum taster?  Well, you know, it's a good point.  I guess I've heard enough.  He's got a lot of people pointing out he is an asshole in that he also makes his own rules 
[00:26:00]  because he got himself reelected, even though that was completely illegal.  It's like, oh, let me get.  Can I get another term?  I'll just say yes.  And then can we vote on if people want another term?  No.  OK, I won't have a fourth fucking term.  And you know what?  I guess the sugary drinks, blah, blah, health, health costs, blah, blah, blah.  Hurting all of us, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But going back to Jimmy's point with the drinking and the smoking, that's way fucking worse. 
[00:26:30]  And I would bet money a lot of people have a lot more stress on their lives and are unhealthy  because of the commute they deal with.  Yeah.  That shit will pound your heart to death, man.  The stress factor, terrible.  I used to scream and yell every day on the way home because of the traffic.  I couldn't do it anymore.  I talk about how I go crazy.  And the only reason you're doing it is because of the hours we keep now.  And I talk about how I go crazy driving and stuff.  But the truth of the matter is, it's not even near what it used to be.  I mean, you've been in the vehicle years ago when I was going absolutely insane. 
[00:27:00]  I've had to literally talk myself down in situations where it's like, this isn't worth killing yourself  because some idiot probably of the stereotypical ethnic background that doesn't know how to drive  is in front of me.  I sit there and I breathe and go, just relax.  But the fact that you have to do that is insane. 
[00:27:30]  They need more highways, wider roads, more lanes, heading out to Long Island.  And everyone just ignores that.  Like, here's a dumb thing.  I like, well, I didn't go this year much because my team is frustrating.  But the Islanders, I go, you know, I have season tickets usually.  I didn't have it this past year, but I did go to a few games.  If I want to go to an Islanders game at a 7 o'clock start, 7.30 start.  Yeah, what time?  If I don't leave by 1.30.  1.30.  That's hilarious.  I'm not even joking.  This is not even a joke. 
[00:28:00]  Where are they playing?  Oklahoma?  1.30.  And I'm not going all the way out to Huntington.  I'm going, you know, to the Nassau Coliseum, which, honestly, if it was clear sailing,  it would take maybe a half hour.  Maybe.  I have to leave at 1.30.  And then I get in the parking lot.  You can see me next season.  I'm the guy sleeping in the fucking parking lot for a couple hours.  Because there's no other way to do it.  If I leave at 3 or 4, believe it or not, I'm going to miss the start of the game.  Have it in the car at 6.15.  Just shoot on over.  It'll be easier once they start playing in Brooklyn. 
[00:28:30]  I'm praying that happens.  Oh, you think they will be?  Yeah.  I'm praying.  You know, they wouldn't mind having a hockey team in Brooklyn.  You know, it'd help the cost of the fucking new arena.  That's going to be a fucking mess.  Parking and trying to get to that new arena.  Yeah, but I'll just jump on some trains.  You know where it is.  It's the same one with the basketball.  Yeah, it's at Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn.  People there will be like, what's this skating thing?  I've never seen it before.  It's amazing.  Why is white people skating around?  It's nice.  White people got like blades on their feet and shit.  That's crazy. 
[00:29:00]  I think that's going to be like an MSG thing, though.  A lot of people fucking just jump on trains when they go to Knicks and Rangers games.  Sure, but I mean, if you're not...  How far into Brooklyn will it be?  I don't even know Brooklyn.  I mean, it's about...  I don't know much about Brooklyn.  It's about 15 minutes outside of Manhattan.  On a train?  On a train, yeah.  Subway close?  There's tons of subways.  All right, there you go.  I'm good.  Subways for Brooklyn suck.  I'm good.  They're terrible, right?  I take one every day.  Well, I go through.  No, they're not bad, actually.  All right, braggard.  Yes, I'm bragging that I live in an outer borough.  Your beachfront property. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, an hour and a half away.  See, everyone's saying fix the LIE.  Take on that fucking challenge, Bloomberg.  You'll fail miserably, so instead you'll go after stupid soft drinks.  I don't give a fuck if people drink themselves to death, whether it's beer or soda.  I don't care.  That's not my life.  And I don't care if the health costs go up.  And I wouldn't have cared if I had no money either, by the way.  How are you going to legislate people's health?  You can't.  Like, if you want to eat yourself to death or drink shitty stuff, you're going to do it. 
[00:30:00]  There's no way the government should ever step in on shit like that.  And he's one of the worst people with legislating your own personal freedoms and freedom of choice.  Shouldn't we only have to pay for a certain amount of it, though?  Like, I'm fine if, like, you're an addict, and I know food's an addiction, but I think the public should only be held responsible for so much of your refusal to do the right thing for yourself.  Like, you can't ban sugary drinks, because a lot of guys are in shape that drink them. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  So they should be allowed to do it.  But if you're a fucking big fatso, and you're just driving up medical costs, and it's obvious because you refuse to stop eating badly,  then I think we should only pay for a certain amount, or you should be fucking forced to pay for your own food amputation.  I don't disagree with that, and, you know, the mayor should take that on.  But that's why I don't fucking...  Instead of going the easy way.  That's why I'm not into this government-sponsored health care thing, either.  It's like, look, keep yourself in shape. 
[00:31:00]  I do.  If you're going to be a pig drinking soda and be diabetic because of it, that's your problem.  And if you need medical attention because of it, that's your fucking problem.  Why the fuck are we held responsible for other people's bad choices, and the mayor is trying to make everybody responsible for it?  We're supposed to pay?  Bad choices, I agree with.  But what about people that just don't have the money?  Like, they're just genuine poor.  Yeah, I think...  I like taking... 
[00:31:30]  I don't mind taking care of poor people.  Ah, the world needs ditched fingers, too, you know.  No, I know, but...  I think you need a very...  I probably should be one if life was fair.  I think you need some basic shit for people.  You're talking this utopian...  Very low-level basic shit, by the way.  Utopian society, though, that just doesn't fucking exist.  In this nation that we have, we have really a lot of good things, but it's never going to be perfect.  There are going to be people that die, that are in horrific shape, that can't afford things. 
[00:32:00]  We don't have a country...  I think everybody walks around thinking, we should have a country where everyone is treated perfectly and everything.  It's not going to happen.  Sorry.  But we do have enough money to take care of each other.  Who's we?  The country.  And what money is that?  How about this?  Where does it come from?  Take the 1.5 billion or whatever it is that we give to Egypt.  Stop giving it to Egypt.  I agree wholeheartedly.  Take this money...  You know what?  Put it on the roads I drive on.  We can do all that.  I don't want to give it to people that aren't fucking doing anything.  The problem is that we waste money trying to get people to bend to our will in the United Nations, 
[00:32:30]  because we think it's our job to keep the whole world safe, and it's not our fucking business.  We should take care of our own citizens.  I say pull back every penny we give away to other countries.  It's their problem.  But I don't think we should give it to other fucking freeloaders in this country.  Freeloaders are one thing, but poor people.  There's a difference.  They're always...  I think there's always going to be a larger percentage of people fucking the system than  using it legitimately.  And there's not enough people looking out for it. 
[00:33:00]  Dude, I went to buy these apnea masks.  It's funny.  How did that work out?  Not as well as I would have hoped, but the mouth guard works.  But people are Twittering me and emailing me.  They go, dude, your insurance might cover this, might cover that.  And I think there are people that really...  It matters to them.  Like, the apnea masks are like $150.  The machine's expensive, but the masks are not that bad.  I'm really lucky that I didn't care.  I was able just to go out and order a couple of them.  But there are people who literally have to rely on insurance, and they have to rely on  that because they don't make enough money.  And those people I feel bad for. 
[00:33:30]  Like, there are people who work and they've got a wife and two kids.  I feel so bad for so many fucking people.  Where do you draw the line from feeling bad for people?  Like, I feel bad for people that have a fucking hangnail sometimes.  I don't give a shit.  But where do you draw the line where it's like, this person has to fend for themselves,  and we have to pay for this person?  Everyone should get free shit.  No, but I think...  And I think that if you have more money, you should be able to go and buy your own stuff,  your own healthcare.  But I think that everyone should have some basic things.  Let's not forget about the greed.  But they do.  Let's not forget about the greed in the healthcare system. 
[00:34:00]  A lot of it.  It's terrible.  I pay a shitload of insurance.  Unbelievable.  I own a little business, technically, through this radio show and stuff.  And I've got employees, and I've got to pay for their health insurance, right?  And I have acid reflux.  I've got to get these pills every once in a while.  Co-pay.  A hundred bucks.  I pay my fucking insurance.  That's greed right there.  Start there.  No, that's not covered.  Start there.  No, it's covered.  Not having heartburn's a luxury.  No, it's covered, though, by the way.  Because, I mean, I'm kind of throwing some wild numbers out there. 
[00:34:30]  But it's about $100.  And I forgot what it would be if I didn't have the insurance.  Just an insane price for dumb-ass reflux fucking pills.  Although, if you buy the generic hands...  And that's my dumb little world.  There are people out there that have to take real fucking medicine,  and they do have insurance, and they're getting killed with the co-pays.  Wait, Nana wants to talk.  Yeah, that is true.  I've changed since I've become a father.  Just buy the generic.  Since I've become a father, I've changed it. 
[00:35:00]  Now that you're pregnant with your first child, you weirdo.  I found my insurance won't cover like NXIVM,  so I fucking cover the...  Or whatever it is.  Yeah.  Oh, no, they ask me if I want the no-name or whatever.  And I'll take the no-name one.  Every time, because if you look at it, it's the same exact shit.  But I want to see people covered for basic...  Because I agree with you...  You've got to start with the greed.  I think you'd find a lot of fucking money.  But I'll tell you what the greed comes down to.  It comes down to us.  Because the insurance companies are scumbags, but you know what?  They get sued a lot.  Like, the doctors have astronomical insurance, but they get sued a lot. 
[00:35:30]  Sometimes justifiably, other times no.  So it all comes down to the greed of the public.  Because people...  Yes.  We are the ones who sue and want $2 million in punitive damages.  You know, it's like...  Right.  There's no...  We're partially to blame.  There's a culture of fucking litigation that goes on now today.  And it's...  Yeah.  It's taking people, doctors, every profession, that just gets sued now because people see 
[00:36:00]  an easy buck.  And you're raising the point about healthcare going, we can't take care of people who are  cheating the system.  I agree with that.  Yeah.  But we...  Because to me, it sounds like you're saying, it's just not fair that I have to pay for  so-and-so.  It's not.  But you know what else is not fair?  People who have so much, they don't suffer the same penalties either.  Like, when they commit a similar crime, or they commit a crime that hurts society more,  they don't pay.  They don't go to fucking regular prison like a guy who makes a very little amount of money.  They can afford to get the best lawyers.  They can...  It's like... 
[00:36:30]  So it comes out on the other end where they're not fucking suffering for the same things either.  Again, you're looking at this utopian society where everything is equal for everybody.  Yeah, I know.  Medical care, justice, everything.  Is it right?  No.  But it's the way it is.  You're never going to get to the point where everyone is equal.  I agree.  In the eyes of the law, in the eyes of medicine.  It's not going to happen. 
[00:37:00]  But trying to be more balanced...  I agree.  But trying to be more balanced is, I think, a nicer goal.  And I'm not saying it's all or nothing.  Like, I'm not saying we should be communist or we should be socialist.  But I just think that we can have a little less of a fucking difference in people who have no coverage.  And then a guy who steals $40 million from the public and is still able to fucking parachute out with a lot of money.  We can.  But not at the cost of people that are achieving in this country is what I'm saying.  I agree. 
[00:37:30]  It should be at the cost of the waste that's going on in this country.  Yes.  It should be at the cost of, like you said, the lawyers and the public that are suing people for no fucking reason but to try to make money for themselves based on nothing.  There's so much shit going on in this country that if it was...  Even half of it was cleared up, we'd have a lot more resources for the people that need it.  Of course.  Of course.  Welfare is like, yeah, there are people who cheat welfare. 
[00:38:00]  But they're not the ones who have us in the hole.  Like, it's not...  They don't do enough to...  They're annoying and you're always going to have shitty cheats and always have shitty vultures and...  Yeah.  But there are.  But they have more numbers than the scumbags you're talking about, the Wall Street guys that are fucking over the public.  They have fewer numbers than the multitude of people fucking the system.  And the fewer numbers are stealing a lot more money.  And those people, I think, are... 
[00:38:30]  Because when you look at, like, what shakes confidence in America or our corporations or our ability to function financially,  on a great scale, we don't look at, ah, look at those shitheads in Brooklyn on the dole.  We're, like, we're worried about banks collapsing and all these things that are being...  I don't know.  That's what hurts the country's perception of the country.  I look at it the other way.  I see people that are fucking the system over and people that are on welfare that don't deserve it,  people that aren't working, that are on the dole.  So I see that as being more detrimental than these Wall Street... 
[00:39:00]  Occasional Wall Street assholes that fucking fuck people over.  I disagree.  I think that they're annoying, but I don't...  They irritate me, but they don't fucking steal the amount of money.  And they don't cause corporations to fold or banks to collapse.  I see it more like a shitload of termites versus a pterodactyl.  Well, it's...  I'm more afraid of the termites.  Yeah, but the pterodactyl...  I would agree with you...  He goes, yeah. 
[00:39:30]  I don't know.  Did you hear even what I said?  I would agree with you.  Oh, my God.  I would agree with you.  You finally admitted it.  Thank God.  Dude, I would agree with you.  Holy shit.  If the pterodactyl fucking knocked into the house,  and then the fucking government picked it up and brushed it off  and sent it back on its way.  Like, if they killed the pterodactyl, I would kind of agree with you.  All right.  But the punish...  It's like, you know, yeah, on one side,  the medical care is very uneven, and it's not fair,  and we don't want to care for it.  But on the flip side, they're not getting the same fucking penalties, 
[00:40:00]  the same suffering, or the same fucking jail shit.  They're getting away with it.  It comes out in the wash on the other end.  Most people are getting killed out there.  Most people are getting fucking killed.  And I mean fucking honest people.  There's so many calls right now about the insurance costs,  auto insurance costs.  I completely understand.  Gas prices, the fucking commuting costs.  A lot of people are getting fucked with you.  But that comes on the back of these companies,  initially at least, trying to protect themselves  against people fucking them. 
[00:40:30]  It's come full circle.  They fuck people over because so many years,  they've had to raise their rates because insurance fraud?  It's fucking rampant.  It's crazy.  We just look the other way as a society and as a country.  A society.  A society.  When are we going to fucking fix some of this shit?  And the companies always,  when people unionize and stuff like that,  nobody did that because they were being greedy.  There was a long, long time where workers and stuff, 
[00:41:00]  and I hate to defend unions.  It gets perverted after time.  Absolutely.  But I mean, the basic problem was,  I believe the companies took advantage of people  and underpaid them long before greedy, litigious mentality took over.  It started a long time ago.  I'm going to go to James really fast.  I'm right here.  James.  Shit, man.  I want to ask you about,  what about the Constitution where it says  all men are created equal?  It started... 
[00:41:30]  Created equal?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That all started out as a fucking lie.  We all know it.  Created equal?  It was all white men are created equal, first of all.  Atta boy.  They didn't even want to acknowledge black people.  I hate the fact that that shit was started.  And they didn't really want to acknowledge women either.  Even though it's all men are created equal,  they were trying to say all humans are created equal,  but that was complete bullshit.  Or transgendered.  Transgenders.  Hey, James.  Yeah.  The gays.  Not Jimmy.  Yeah.  All these fucking people were not created equal. 
[00:42:00]  What's your whole point, though,  in what I'm talking about?  Go ahead.  Because by me being black,  you brought up a point that  the law is not completely equal  or never would be.  Yeah.  I'm trying to figure out your mindset with that  because by me being black,  I see it on the other end  that I kind of drive a high-end car  and I get pulled over all the time in the suburbs.  Oh.  And what happens? 
[00:42:30]  You know what?  What happens?  Do you do something to reinforce any stereotype  or do you do something where the cop might eventually say,  eh, you know what?  I fucked up on that one.  I have a tough time believing that  black guys are getting pulled over all the time.  I never see black people pulled over.  It's always me.  In the suburbs because they're driving a nice car.  Yes.  I have a hard time believing that at this point.  I do too.  I'm sure it kind of happens here and there,  but too many guys come forward  and say this happens all the time.  I don't believe that anymore. 
[00:43:00]  Does it happen to you sometimes, James?  Yes, sir.  Yes, it happens to me sometimes.  How many times is all the time?  Since I was 19,  it's probably happened about,  I'd say a dozen times.  All right.  Since I've been 19,  I have been pulled over probably 80 times.  And I'm not even kidding.  80?  Probably 80 times.  But you're always,  that's a tenth of the time you break the law.  He's saying he's just driving a nice car.  Something tells me this motherfucker ain't just driving.  You're probably speeding. 
[00:43:30]  Maybe you didn't use your blinker.  Maybe they,  they don't just pull black people over.  There's usually a reason.  The last,  when I was,  I was probably 20.  I was out in this neighborhood  where I was dating this white girl.  Oh, wow.  That was your first mistake.  Pulled me over  every time I went to her house.  That's funny.  Every time on her way to the house.  And it wasn't that I was speeding,  because I knew what it was about.  Her father was a cop?  Yeah.  Imagine that guy. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, her father knew some people.  Yeah, but I know.  How naive are you?  And, like,  a lot of my family's in law enforcement.  I'm going to be real respectful to them.  I don't blame them.  They're just doing their job.  Exactly.  I think Ann makes a good point.  I don't feel like...  I don't...  I think Ann makes a really good point.  Like,  if we all thought about it,  you know,  we've been pulled over a lot.  I've been pulled over so many times.  I'm nowhere near that,  but I bet you it's close to 20 times 
[00:44:30]  since I started driving.  Yeah, but, see, like,  I know Ann's a hot rider.  I'm like...  Oh, thank you.  To that Shelby,  I know it's false.  But it's still...  It's lopsided.  When I'm doing 25  in a residential area,  and I just get pulled over,  and they ask,  what am I doing there?  Or when you get followed  for 15, 20 minutes,  and you're making turns  just to make sure  that you're not...  You're getting followed.  There's something going on.  Hey, aren't you pissed off, though, 
[00:45:00]  at the fact that  when they ask you that,  perhaps it's because  the last 10 people  that we're going through  had a problem,  and the people of color  that were driving  through that neighborhood  perhaps had stolen goods  in the car  or fit a profile,  and you're not even supposed  to use profile.  But let's just say  that that...  I don't give those niggas a pass.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Please don't say that word.  Now he's using  the fucking N-word.  I'm offended  being a Sicilian. 
[00:45:30]  That's very hurtful, sir.  You know the Moors.  Your voice gets very high  when you get excited.  Yeah.  I look at those dope boys  standing out in the corner  with their pants sagging.  They're fucking you!  Not the cops!  Them guys are fucking you!  I know!  I know, but I'll put it...  It's nothing to go.  Nothing completely  all on one person.  Any kind of problem,  usually it's because  it's pushed one way  and then all of a sudden  it swings back 
[00:46:00]  as a new reaction.  The pendulum swings back  the other way.  But James, hold on one second.  But you know what he's saying.  Those guys are fucking you.  The other guys fucking up  have kind of cost his life to be...  Yeah.  When you look at something  that happened,  it's different,  but when you got divorced,  how angry you got  and fucking hated it.  But technically,  the reason divorce laws  are the way they are  is because for so many years  women were sent out  with nothing.  Oh, yeah, in the 1800s.  But initially,  there was a reason  and it got perverted  and twisted and fucked. 
[00:46:30]  But you know how angry  that made you  and how you were just...  When you said,  I got thrown into a system  and you're not a person,  you're just a fucking...  You're an A plus B equals C  and that made you want  to fucking lop heads off.  Yeah.  Like, I mean, that's...  I'm trying to think of  when you say that,  who I was really angry at.  Just the whole thing.  I was angry at everything.  Her, the lawyers,  the judge for not hearing  your side of it,  the whole fucking thing  for just looking at you  not as an individual  with your own experience  and this cunt 
[00:47:00]  or whatever you would have said.  Right.  But, or whatever.  But being in this situation...  It's like a master.  But you know what I'm saying?  Accurate.  They looked at you like,  all right, fuck you.  You're a man.  She's the woman.  Here it goes.  Formula, formula, formula.  And you were like,  what the fuck?  And on a different scale,  imagine going through that  for whatever other reason.  It's probably fucking enraging.  And if you're talking to somebody  like, ah, come on, man.  Other guys fucked you over.  You go, you have it.  Fuck that.  That doesn't make it better.  It doesn't make it better,  but I can almost understand 
[00:47:30]  why it was done in the first place.  I do know that.  It shouldn't be now.  No, and it does make me angry,  and it did, but...  It wasn't fair.  I see your point.  Yeah, it wasn't fair.  I see your point, Jimmy.  All right.  God, what are you,  channeling Patrice, you motherfucker?  Not at all.  I hate when he used to talk  and fucking twist me around.  No.  I was like, fuck, I can't even...  I'm just trying to get back to you.  I can't argue that.  I'm just trying to get back to you.  Hit you with some logic?  Shit.  I'm trying to get back to your friends  blowing your dreams.  Jimmy's tenting.  All right, thanks, James, 
[00:48:00]  for the phone call.  You've got a guy on Twitter.  His Twitter name's too long  and ridiculous to even promote.  Why do they do that?  Make it simple.  You've got to make it easy  if you want to try  to get some followers.  Anyway, he writes,  I make $35,000 a year.  That's just bucks?  This comes in a lot.  Pre-tax.  I pay over $5,000 a year  just so my family  could have health insurance.  That's just stupid.  That's just crazy talk.  Yeah.  I went without insurance  like a lot of people  because it was easier that way.  Ten years I didn't have it.  Yeah, you just take the chance 
[00:48:30]  because you can't afford it.  You have to.  I just took...  I rolled the dice  like most people my age  growing up.  Wrong, babe.  Oh!  When you're younger,  you do take the chance  because the odds are...  You're playing the odds  just like you do with anything.  When you try to start a business  or anything,  you're taking a chance.  You're rolling the dice.  I went from 18...  Well, I don't know how it worked  in my parents' insurance  at the time,  but from 18 to 29,  it was very squirrely. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  And most of that time,  it did not have health insurance.  You didn't know.  And I also went into a business  that they didn't believe  in health insurance  and half the shit  that we have now.  Radio is just a shitty fucking,  you know, job, technically.  It's a great job,  but they didn't take care of anybody.  And that health insurance stuff,  you know,  finally made its way into radio.  When you're younger,  everybody has to take that shot  that nothing's going to happen.  Everyone takes a chance.  That's why there's  Make-A-Wish Foundation.  Right.  It's not, you know,  buy your shit foundation.  Eh, you know, 
[00:49:30]  if I want to see Brad Pitt  and I'm dropping dead,  eh, you can just buy him.  And if you want to shoot a bear,  you call Uncle Ted  because I'll help you.  I'll take you out.  Right before we put you in the box,  we'll put a bear in the box.  We'll put you in a bear  in the box together.  I really got you.  Ted, you're a great man.  All right.  What a humanitarian.  And the scary part is  how many people are  taking a chance  driving their cars  because they can't afford  the car insurance.  That shit's happening, too.  You don't want to be hit  by one of those fucking guys.  That pisses me off.  The second someone hits you  and gets out  and you don't understand the language,  oh, you just know you're fucked. 
[00:50:00]  No fault.  Yeah, no fault.  You see it in New York  all the time.  Little fender benders  and they are negotiating  on the side of the road.  It's one of my favorite things  to watch.  Guys start pulling out money  like, look,  how much to make this go away?  I don't want to deal with this.  My insurance is going up  or I don't have insurance,  whatever the fuck it is.  And they're just negotiating.  But that's the thing  even with insured people.  They want to negotiate  and fix it at the site  instead of going through insurance  because your rates  will go up like crazy.  Yeah.  I saw one on 72nd Street. 
[00:50:30]  Guy hit a cab  and the cab was furious.  And the guy was obviously  in a hurry.  Some rich fucking  Upper West Side asshole.  And he's peeling off money  and the cab's like,  no, he's just getting pissed.  He wants to call the cops.  The damage was significant.  A whole bumper shit thing was out.  And the guy didn't want to deal  because he was too busy.  He was on his way somewhere  and he kept peeling off money.  Pedestrians are going,  more, more, more.  We're watching from across the street.  And he finally hit his number  where the cab goes,  all right. 
[00:51:00]  And next thing you know,  the cab, he's not mad anymore.  Grabs all the fucking money.  The guy jumps back in his SUV  and takes off.  And we're like,  it was fucking great.  It was hilarious.  The cab, you'll probably claim  it was he was hit  while he was parked  or something.  So he's going to get the money  and then also get the money  through insurance.  Right.  Yes.  But, I mean,  he played hardball for a while.  This guy couldn't come up  with enough money at first.  But the guy,  you could tell,  was like,  I don't have time  to deal with this right now.  People feel very entitled  to getting something  from companies. 
[00:51:30]  And I understand  the greed in corporations  like Jimmy talks about.  It's rampant.  But what is more rampant  is the abuse  that the public takes  on corporations.  And their only recourse  is to raise rates  on everything.  Do you think  the insurance companies,  and I know,  they're greedy pricks,  I understand.  There should be  a complete fucking revamping  of the insurance systems.  But what they do  is raise the rates  when they get fucked. 
[00:52:00]  And they're constantly  being fucked over.  They are.  I pay my fucking premiums  and I only use it  when I need to.  I'm an anomaly  with this shit.  You know,  you make a lot of good points.  I feel like there is  smart people in this country.  Why can't they fucking  figure this shit out?  Why can't they figure it out?  But they don't lower the rates.  It's just getting worse and worse.  The banking system  is horrendous.  I was having a discussion  the other day.  I don't even understand  how a young person  even has a bank account.  Why would you?  Why would you?  I have a shitload of money 
[00:52:30]  in a savings account  and the amount of interest  I get on this thing  it's laughable.  On the mattress.  And then I pop it down  to what I used to make.  I'm like,  why would I have  a bank account back then?  Yeah.  I would have got  like a couple dollars  a month maybe  in interest.  So why?  Why would you even  have a bank account?  Put your fucking  put your twenty dollars  into the bank?  They absolutely give  you nothing at this point.  I've taken my money  out of the bank  and I keep a little bit  to pay my bills  and I invest in the rest of it.  Where's the logic there 
[00:53:00]  for a person  making an average income  trying to get a few bucks  in the bank?  Why would they  have a bank account?  But that's how unfair  that system is.  Like that's what  pigs they are.  Like they charge you  four percent  even though interest  is kind of low right now.  Right.  But they literally  they're comfortable  giving nothing.  and I know  it's a business  but they have you  so fucked.  Right.  They don't mind  accepting money  from the government.  People tell me  oh they were forced  to take that money  and they repaid it.  They're fucking pigs.  It goes way beyond 
[00:53:30]  just trying to make money.  But their business  is lending money out  and making money.  They're not making money  fucking you know  with some guys  a hundred dollars  in a savings account.  Right.  They're making money  lending money.  And when the interest rate  is what's the interest rate  now on a mortgage?  That's low I think.  That's low I think.  That's low I think.  When it's four percent  it's low four in some places.  How could you expect them  to give you fucking three percent  on your money in the bank  if they're not making shit  as a business?  They're a business. 
[00:54:00]  They're not there  for your charity.  They're a fucking business.  It's gotten to the point though  I think you're starting  to lose money  by having a bank account.  You're right.  By all the hidden costs  on your checking accounts  and the ATM fees  and all that shit.  But how are they supposed  to make money  when their business  is lending money  at an interest rate  when the interest rate  now is shit?  I'll tell you because  but yeah go ahead.  No no sorry  because like when you look  at like when the interest rates  go up they don't start  giving you more.  Like when the airlines  They do!  When the airline  when the airline  industry 
[00:54:30]  when gas prices go up  and they raise prices  Yes.  They don't drop them.  It's like the gas fucking  it's like golf  or whatever the Exxon  with oh well  we have oil barrels  or whatever.  When's the last time  they don't drop it  if they can help it?  Bring an extra gallon  when I go to fly  and put it right in the wing  and say I'm helping the cost.  I caveat in my pocket  I say go ahead pull over.  Going with Jimmy's point  when gas prices went up  the cabs had a syntax.  Yes.  And they specifically said  you can look it up  this is because you know  gas prices are out of control. 
[00:55:00]  Guess what?  Well I mean  the gas prices went down  and they kept  the fucking syntax.  Now obviously gas prices  are up again.  but it's to Jimmy's point  they're never going to  take that little syntax  away that they  tacked on to your fare.  But as soon as they  add something  they never fucking  take it away.  Banks are very competitive  and interest rates  are very competitive  so if the interest rates  go up  for their lending  it will go up  for your savings also. 
[00:55:30]  It does.  It will go up  but it hasn't  because they're  the rate they get  interest at  when they lend money  hasn't gone up.  It's gone down.  When was the last time  interest rates were raised  for you know  you go to take a loan  for a mortgage  with a bank  you're not paying  a lot of interest.  They have to make money.  I don't like it.  I'm not fucking  I'm not here  praising the banks  but they have to make money.  They're a business.  I understand  and I don't begrudge  them making money 
[00:56:00]  and I know that  we're going to suffer  when they suffer  but again  I don't think  they've behaved  in good faith.  I just don't think  they've behaved  in good fucking faith  as a company.  You're right  but do you think  Home Depot does either?  Do you think  any fucking company  behaves in good faith?  When people realize  every company  is there to make money  they're not there  to serve you  as a fucking  moral icon  of this nation  they're there  to make fucking money.  No but I think  we have a certain  understanding with companies  like when you look 
[00:56:30]  at Apple  they annoy me  because  oh my god  half their jobs  are in China  they drive me crazy  to make money  but as a consumer  I buy an Apple product  and they usually  work pretty well  I find they're innovative  I love them  I get a lot of use  out of them  That fanboy  You know you'll get that now  but they've been  very good  when I've gone in  for customer service  they're always good  on the phone  when I call in  they're fucking coherent  they speak English  I feel like  they've fucking  serviced me  as a customer  well 
[00:57:00]  I don't feel cheated  when I buy  one of their products  even though  they annoy me  what they do  with the stock  and they annoy me  because  they don't release  the fucking  the best technology  they do it slowly  that's the money making shit  that they do  that I hate  but I understand  I get you  they are in good faith  because to me  they sell me a good product  and they have good  customer service  and their stores  I think are so well run  that I feel like  they're acting in good faith  to me as a customer  but do you also  understand something  where else do you go  to buy your Apple product 
[00:57:30]  they're a fucking  one  stand alone business  alright  you could say  there's Windows computers  but no  Apple has become  its own entity  there are people  that will only buy  Apple products  things like the iPhone  the iPad  they're their own  entity  they really  when you think about it  they don't have  a real competition  they do as far as  phones go  and I understand this 
[00:58:00]  but even within that  they're not like  banks or businesses  that are highly  competitive  around themselves  they're their own  entity  you say you go  to the Apple store  you don't go to  a computer store  and walk up  to an Apple section  you go to the  Apple store  well you can't  in Best Buy  they sell them  I know what you mean  but for the most part  it's  that's a weird  company  you're talking  something that's  very different  unique  very unique  doesn't that make 
[00:58:30]  them acting in good  faith even more  impressive then  that they are  their own thing  and they're still  giving me what  I feel like I'm  paying for  but they can do  that  they don't really  have to cut  corners  because they know  their fucking  their consumer base  is going to be  there  other companies  they have to  cut corners  because they got  20 other companies  selling the exact  same thing  and they have  to try to  undercut them  I don't know man  when you look  at like Apple  they can  I mean 
[00:59:00]  Windows we don't  talk about anymore  because Apple  is the big one  but Windows  are still in most  of the world's  computers  and Samsung  is still bigger  I believe Samsung  has more smartphones  out than iPhone  I don't like  good Samsung  it sounded stupid  that motherfucker  could be singing  double guns  bitch  Samsung  right in front  of your eyes  way better  than the fucking  iPhone  oh no  the droid  is way better  way better  but I think  they have more  smartphones out there  yes they do  Apple does have  to compete  with that  and I think 
[00:59:30]  one of the reasons  they've gotten  so big  is because  they behave  a little differently  how annoying  are cable companies  like they have  to make money  we can easily  see what fucking  Apple not really  having the competition  there is  it's huge competition  in smartphones  and computers  and what not  but Apple  has carved  itself  its own niche  as far as  their computers  it's carved  itself  a niche  exactly  can it  core a Apple  it's carved  itself  its own niche  it's a very 
[01:00:00]  unique company  as far as  that goes  I don't think  you could  take that  and really  use it  as an example  for competing  they do  they have  their own  fucking stores  that people  go into  to buy  their product  where there  isn't another  product in there  it's a very  odd situation  well what's  another one  another company  that we all  not many  use  it's a very  odd thing  and that's why  they take 
[01:00:30]  pride in their  service  because it  has people  coming back  if you got  smacked in the  face every time  you walked down  those fucking  glass steps  I'd still walk  in  I would too  I'd stand under  looking at the  girls skirts  but that's how  they became  the biggest  company in the  world  by behaving  that way  and again  they annoy  me with  a lot  of stuff  that money  making  thing  that you're  talking about  I understand  like they have  to fucking  leak the  technology  slowly  so they  milk us  and I go  out and buy  every product  like a  cocksucker  they got me  you're right  but people 
[01:01:00]  don't understand  a lot of  times that  companies  are there  to make  money  not to  fucking  serve you  not to  make you  go home  and go  what a  bunch  of sweet  swell  guys  they're there  to make  money  so are the  banks  so is every  fucking company  on the  Dow  and the  Nasdaq  they're all  there to  make money  that's their  purpose  alright so what  do the people  do though  spend their  fucking money  and hope you  make it a  good deal  and get what  you pay for  the people  are frustrated  they don't  like this  shit  they don't  like how  the system  is being 
[01:01:30]  run  and where  it's heading  so what  do the  people do  hope you  get a  fair deal  that's all  you want  hope  that worked  well for  Obama  yeah  well  that hope  shit  will drive  you nuts  but there's  real fucking  problems out  there so what  can the people  do to push  you're making  great points  but what  what can  the average  person do  I  honestly  I wish  I had an  answer  exactly  that's the  problem  but I think  everyone puts  the problem  and the  anger  on the  companies 
[01:02:00]  themselves  instead of  the people  that are  fucking  the companies  over so  badly  that they  have to  raise the  rates  on the  innocent  people  that are  just  consuming  but the  people  have to  have a  way  to  try to  push  back  how about  pushing  back  on the  fucking  freeloaders  that are  fucking  over  us  that's  why  occupy  wall  street  fucking  rules  omg  their initial  I liked  initially what  they started  out as  but I didn't  like what  they became  I thought  again I liked  it when they  were targeting  people 
[01:02:30]  I liked the  idea but  it was not  organized  I felt that  they became  a bunch of  spoiled brats  their initial  idea of never  using deodorant  well that one  I actually like  on a woman  if you have  pits stink  I'll fucking  throw you  hairy bush  occupy your  lap with  hair  didn't I  say that  once before  I think I  did  it's a  good one  so might  as well  do it  twice  is it  syntax  what's the  term  syntax  or  surtax  what is  it called  I got  syntax errors  when I used  to try to  program  in basic 
[01:03:00]  but what  is that  weird  fucking  tax  they  throw  on  shit  well  bomb  rooney  a  syntax  they add  to  cigarettes  and alcohol  so what is  a syntax  meaning the  words  smoke or  drink  you  faggot  exactly  I'm aware  of the  product  and there's  a surtax  too  I believe  that's all  because there's  surcharges  a word  so surcharge  oh  oh  surcharge  who is  surcharge  I  knight you  surcharge  how come  they don't  call it a 
[01:03:30]  mam charge  go to break  go to break  we're gonna  go to break  with a  Louis C.K.  bit  I got better  jokes than  him  Louis C.K.  was he  two letters  or something  I saw him  do this  fucking bit  oh  his bank  bit is  really  fucking  good  man  all that  shit  yeah  I don't  listen to  it  it's got  like a lot  of salty  language  my mother  always said  that Louis  is a  potty  mouth  and she  also said  don't  jibber  jabber  don't  jibber  jabber  chipper  Louis

[01:07:30]  I don't frankly  see what you're angry about  the bank has a right to accrue a fee  clearly  that's how different it is to be rich than it is to be poor  because when you're rich the bank pays you for being rich  if you have a lot of money they give you money because you have a lot of money  they say you have so much money that we should give you some  because you have a lot you should have more here take more money take this guy's 15 fuck him

[01:11:00]  but they're  but they're  but they're out of the  and turn around  kopitar  it's kopitar  and you want  you might ask  who's kopitar  i don't even know much about kopitar  i am kopitar  i do know this much  he scored the winning goal last night  so roland decided to get the kopitar  fucking shirt  would you get that like last night  no sir  you just happen to have a kopitar shirt  yesterday afternoon  he's got a shirt with every team member's name on it  and regardless of what they do  he just throws that one on  and looks like a hero  so why are you wearing the l.a. king's t-shirt 
[01:11:30]  the kopitar t-shirt  to support them  but you don't like the kings really  i do grew up with the kings  name five l.a. king's players  um  quick  kopitar  brown  gretzky  go gretzky  tetley chipperson  tetley  tetley chipperson  argus  what a horrible name that would be for a hockey player  tetley passes to chipperson  right  and  holgut  shoot  score  melancamp is rubbing ice on his teeth 
[01:12:00]  edgar's last name  of course  edgar melancamp  that's his last name  melancamp  i didn't know that  you see his face against the ice  just rubbing his teeth on the ice  trying to get him wet  oh  he's chasing the zamboni  so now you're into the l.a. kings  go kings  oh god  you're not into the kings  you have no passion  you should be into the queens  oh shit  he got to there  oh man  banana peel toss  swim walk 
[01:12:30]  what was it 2-1 in overtime last night  yeah  kings lead the series  we're talking stanley cup now  we're down to the final two teams  oh yeah this is it  and i'm going kings as well  you haven't lost in nine games  i can't go devils  can't go devils  i went devils against the rangers  because it was the lesser of two evils  but can't go devils  kevin smith  kevin smith beat me up on the twitter last night  for not going fucking devils  can't go devils  who went devils  new york doesn't go devils  huh  well  pennsylvania might go devils 
[01:13:00]  jersey's going devils  jersey obviously goes devils  maybe delaware  some wimpy rangers fans  probably going devils  because they have to do the new york  almost new york thing  whatever  gotta go kings  if you like either the rangers  or the islanders  why would you want the devils  to win the cup  the king's never won the cup  huh  the king's never won the stanley cup before  wow  there's some trivia today  there's some fucking trivia  yeah  all right  kathy lee gifford is a complete dummy 
[01:13:30]  we all know that  we do know that  i was trying to think of something to say to that  but i wasn't starting a bit or anything  it's just a statement  yeah  she is  it's broad  we've been on to her for a long fucking time  she's on what show now  she's on that  horrible after the today show i think  what's it called  post-menopausal  yeah  cunt and dumbella  we used to play their clips remember  hodo  hodo or something  hodo  i don't know  hoda  hoda and waga  hoda and kathy lee  is that the name of the show  it's terrible  it's technically still a today show 
[01:14:00]  but it's their  it's their shit show  yeah  oh they do a shit show  yeah it's their after show  oh that's cool  do they have an e-rock that comes on  and sounds excited to be on the air  does he really when he's on  oh god yeah  it's a different e-rock  you should hear e-rock on the air  e-rock is like the  the fucking co-host of the show  it kind of makes me laugh  because i i know we  just beat him down  he comes on  oh he loves the fact that  we're not here  he's so happy he doesn't see  any of our faces  he comes on  he can be himself  he's got like a personality  right 
[01:14:30]  he talks to sam  and he's like  well let me tell you sam  it's all radio sounding  and then he takes shots at me  i just roll my eyes  i'm like really  i've heard the constant shots at you  yeah  it really is relentless  real brave  it's relentless  real brave  what's he say  say something brave boy  he just gets braver  when we're not here  he says things like  oh what do you want me  to be more like opie  and it's detriment  not detrimental  you're not a superhero  who do you think you are  thor  my arm is thor by the way  did i mention that  oh my god  i said that during commercial  as chip  yeah  and chip said 
[01:15:00]  don't say it on the air  i want to use that one  i could deliver it better  and chip was asking me  chip was asking me  to feed him that joke  feed him  feed him  feed me the throat line  i'll hit the home run  with it  so you're  why do you criticize  the boss  when he's not around  great question  i'm trying  trying to what  he's trying to do nothing  trying to do what  digest  what were you trying  to do there  an anvil  your acting is horrendous  digest an anvil  takes a while  or an anthrax  for a black sabbath  oh shit 
[01:15:30]  double gun  double gun  oh shit  yeah why  why are you doing that  what's the resentment  there's no resentment  and what were you  trying to do  to buy  uh some time  no  was it buy time  people in here  were talking  i was telling  i like buy time  buy time  or buy some time  i like buy time  buy time  b-i time you mean  buy time  oh shit  yeah shit  so iraq what  what is the resentment  there's no resentment  just say it  it's open for  no it's more  no cause it's 
[01:16:00]  it's all of us really  i mean you can  fucking focus on me  but it's all of us  like iraq feels  way more comfortable  when we're not around  and he likes taking  shots at you though  when you're not around  like he doesn't really  take shots at an ant  in gym  no  he's got  he feels very comfortable  taking shots at you  on the after show  he really does  uh huh  who brought you  into this fucking place  my mom  these guys  who made you  number two hero  that's right  who's mistreated you  for seven years now  these guys  never forget about  these guys  didn't meet you  at a truck stop  hoping for a blow job  i did  absolutely not 
[01:16:30]  i did  yep  i wasn't offering  we put gravy  on our dicks  and got them  i did  so why you  take the shots  at me  these guys  didn't know  who the fuck  you were  or care  i took the chance  and fucking  met you  at our truck stop  in the middle  of florida  that's right  cunt bag  that's right  bag of cunt  cunt bag  why you  taking shots  at the boss  let's get to it  stop meandering  back and forth  no loyalty  not a bid  no loyalty  come on  come on  what happened  on the after show 
[01:17:00]  it's like  anything goes  look out  look out  look out  for the sam show  anything goes  anything can happen  except entertaining radio  where people could just be themselves  yeah yeah  that's weird  eric can just hang out  what a weird concept that is  we should try that someday  feel like a piece of shit  did you guys finally feel comfortable  on the air yesterday 
[01:17:30]  when you all three  were on the after show  i wasn't  i was so pissed  when i left  at the time  i'm like  why did i fucking  waste 20 minutes  of good travel time  talking to that dolt  we get to leave early today  well that's true  that's right  he made an appearance  on another show  good buffoon  i think what eric's saying  is he will explain  why he's more comfortable  on the after show  at 10 a.m. today  on the after show  oh what  are you teasing  the after show  on our fucking show  you don't do that 
[01:18:00]  you're making him uncomfortable  i will talk to him  on the after show  oh the better interviewer  will get it out of eric  yes  the better interviewer  the guy that asks other people  the questions  that get answers  on his show  and then we say  well why didn't you  bring it to this show  and he says  well no i just asked  during the show  meanwhile  he knew  during our show  of course  but he waits  till the after show  so come on  eric let's get to it now  stop fucking  futzing around in there  why do you feel  more comfortable 
[01:18:30]  in the after show  and eric go  okay  so if somebody  asked me  on this show  well i'll do  sam's show first  if sam will go  what'd you do yesterday  okay and i'll explain  what i did yesterday  see that's exactly  what i'm talking about  hey what did you  do yesterday  fat fat  you're a loser  no one likes you  that's your internal dialogue  it's also the voice of god  you know what  he does kind of  make a good point  might have a point  there  i can't fault him  for making a good point  every time i've listened 
[01:19:00]  sam has been nothing  but great to you  so  all right fair enough  we do try to keep it  honest here  so i can't  i can't deny that  why are you taking  shots at the boss  that's not fat  no one likes you  you're losing  whatever sam will get  it out  yeah yeah  we'll wait  we'll wait  i honestly don't  care  does he take a lot  of shots at the boss  all the time  who cares  sometimes he doesn't  do his face  on the after show  though  i see the amount 
[01:19:30]  of listeners  that just punch out  when he starts talking  it's crazy  but sam  oh it's terrible  yeah  that's when i roll  my eyes  because i'm like  really  you have a chance  to do it on the  regular show  that's right  you ignore what  he's saying  of course  you just continue  on with whatever  he's being a pussy  let's get to hoda  and kathleen gifford  oh  they had marty short  on a lot of people  that know martin short  they like to call  marty short  i was like wow  no i like that  i thought you knew  him  i like people that  do that  it's like people  that used to say  chuck heston  chuck  i know chuck

[01:21:30]  and see if i can figure it out  you really don't know  no i was uh  i was in  and then i'll play it first  play the first track  oh this is the best  anthony can guess  and do not tell him  if he's right or wrong  then play the second track  for the reveal  no i didn't  don't look down on your screen  i didn't do anything  don't look at your screen  just look at my bulge  alright  here we go  marty short  on with hoda  fat cock  they're all geniuses  my children  and you and nancy  have got one of the  greatest marriages 
[01:22:00]  of anybody  in show business  how many years  now for you guys  we uh  married 36 years  but you're still  like in love  madly in love  madly in love  why  cute  i'm cute  yes that is true  and you make each other laugh  yes  right  uh oh  uh oh  you don't know  dude  they're either divorced  or she's dead  let's play the explanation  from kathy lee  that's your answers  yeah  that's what you're going with  that's what i'm going with  hey guys  before we go on  martin just told me 
[01:22:30]  as he was leaving  he said kathy you probably  didn't know  but his beautiful  precious wife nancy  did pass away  oh my god  oh my god  you dumb cunt  but me and jimmy  were discussing this  before the show  and we don't understand  why marty didn't go  hey you stupid bitch  my wife died  two years ago  he didn't want her  to feel uncomfortable  but we're just  saying it nicely  like that's  but you know what's  driving us nuts  tough shit  that's  that's acceptable  like and i  and i understand 
[01:23:00]  it's awkward  but he could have  just said  oh hey my wife  passed away  and she would  oh sorry about that  you can't  you can't  try to explain  why he didn't have  rational thinking  at that fucking  unbelievable moment  oh my god  i i think most people  would call her out  like really  no no my wife  let me hear it again  can i hear it again  which part  the first part  i gotta hear it  the whole thing now  in context of knowing  what happened  let me hear  he had many opportunities  to say something  yeah  they're all geniuses  my children 
[01:23:30]  wow  and you and nancy  have gotten one of  the greatest marriages  of anybody  in show business  how many years  now for you guys  we uh  married 36 years  we are married  but you're still  like in love  madly in love  madly in love  wow  why  oh my  i'm cute  yes that is cute  and you make each  other laugh  yes  right  marty  marty sucks  see no he's just  he had  he had  he had three distinct  opportunities  three opportunities  to say something  but after the first one  stick up for your dead wife  dope  ah i said something 
[01:24:00]  he should have said  we were married for 36 years  she passed away  two years ago  she passed away  two years ago  and kathy would have said  oh i didn't know  and he would have said  obviously  like like gif  who passed away  fucking 20 years ago  and you still sleep  with his corpse  but it's not even  knocking martin  we're just trained  that pleasant  is okay  like it's  it's this sanitized  veil  don't make it  uncomfortable  not on the air  i wait till the  fucking commercial  but i do disagree  with jimmy a little bit  on that one  i think most  most people would 
[01:24:30]  call her out  like what are you  talking about  my wife's dead  my wife  right  they would say  something  right  i hope so  they would  i don't know  why marty decided  to play it  as cool as he did  marty short  she also apologized  to him on twitter  at martin short  it's not his twitter  oh my god  the wrong twitter  it just sucks  what is his twitter  lonely marty  oh my god  no  she's dead  at i miss my wife  oh  she was very badly 
[01:25:00]  raped  you see  oh that didn't  happen  that is terrible  wow that's awkward  here's the  here's the dumb  apart  hey guys  before we go on  hey guys  martin just told me  as he was leaving  he said kathy  you probably didn't  know but his  beautiful  precious wife  nancy did pass  away  a year and a half  ago  of ovarian cancer  oh  ovarian cancer  well how much  did it change  i fucking hate 
[01:25:30]  oh it's varied  yeah  that's  that even for chip  that's terrible  ovarian cancer  even for chip  that's the worst  fucking joke  i've ever heard  ovarian cancer  it goes from this  to that  you don't even know  what it is  it varies  chip don't even  try to sell it  i feel so badly  but he said  kathy he said  at her funeral  mike nichols said  just keep the  conversation going  and the way he was  speaking of her  well he sounded like  he said he had  one of the great  marriages  and at the end  he told you  i still do  so my apologies 
[01:26:00]  to him and his  family for not  realizing that  but he's still  he's one of the  greatest guys  ever  why i fucking  told her to take  a hike  she don't even  know when people  are dead  wow  what a  she really came  off looking like  an idiot  like she should  just know that  yeah  don't bring up  someone's fucking  wife  he's not 20  years old  we would have  had that on  our prep sheet  oh  our one  one page 
[01:26:30]  would you have  said wife  died ovarian  cancer  a year and a  half  i would have  said his wife  died  yes  i've been like  marty  you're beautiful  no you wouldn't  have you would  have called  him her name  when she walked  in the studio  yeah mrs short  look i thought  we were past  that since the  ice cube  incident  which is  hilarious  can we play  that again  what was this  yesterday i guess  oh yeah it was  there's an added  layer to it  because we took

[01:47:30]  stop  jesus christ  i love making  chip laughing  the beauty of this  clip is the people  are just sitting  there  they sit there  they're used to it  they're like always  showboating  if you were there  wouldn't you be  looking around like  holy shit  this is awesome  you know why  i think they're used  to politicians  showboating like  that occasionally  and they see it  as being a hack  they do  like when a guy  does something like  oh my god  it's outlandish  on the floor  i think they see  it like oh  he's being a hack  stop come on 
[01:48:00]  we get it  like that's  i don't see as  that was very sincere  i still don't know  what the problem  i think  what was the problem  i think he was  trying to be  passionate at the  beginning of the  clip you hear it  right  but he fucking  stumbled on some  of his words  yeah  and it made him  mad at himself  and he just had  a he had a go  with it  continue going  with it  yeah he had a go  with it  where's uh  where's some of  our classic clips  do we go the  wrestling route  casey casem's  overplayed  but what about  i have paul anchor  with the shirts  yeah let's listen  to paul anchor  in the shirts  oh i love 
[01:48:30]  we haven't heard  this in a while  a very long time  paul anchor  was recorded  he didn't know  he was being  recorded  and he lost  his fucking mind  he did  what was his  big song  uh paul anchor  do you remember  do you remember  the times  of your life  didn't he write  my way  i did it  my way  he also wrote  the theme song  to the tonight show  oh i didn't know that  really  is that

[01:51:00]  and you have no  conscience  you have no  heart  you have no  integrity  do you understand  that  then all you do  is you take the  fucking money  and you've got  no substance  remember  people of substance  and character  care about what  the fuck they do  when they fix it  okay  and i think you're  working with me  because i think  that's the way you are  and i don't throw  any punches  on you guys  i am telling you  that his job  is on thin ice  and you know  how fast i move  i don't care  if you're a light man  a production manager  an agent  or a theater owner  like last night  you understand  i have a new philosophy

[01:56:30]  fucking  pastor comes  out and sucks  the kid's  dick  exactly  yeah  i guess that  was it  oh the  kid's running  back out  what's the rest  of the clip  though  oh it's  probably  ain't that  great  oh it's the 
[01:57:00]  same clip  over  i don't know  what the  pastor says  ain't no  homo  gonna  make it  it's catchy  i love when  adults fuck  kids up  it's so cool  when adults  completely fucking  twist kids minds 
[01:57:30]  it's great  they're so  malleable  kids  you can just  fucking  mold their  little brains  into any  fucking  hatred you  have  it's  fantastic  ain't no  homo's gonna  make it to  heaven  jesus  oh my  god  wonderful  oh my  god  it's  fantastic  i just love  people that  and they  cheer like  no one  thinks about 
[01:58:00]  the repercussions  of that kid  growing up  with that  attitude  they're just  all cheering  like oh  it's cute  singing you  know  ain't no  homo's gonna  make it to  heaven  and no  and i don't  even i'm not  even talking  about the  the gay  fucking thing  i'm just  talking about  like  like letting  a kid  see such  hatred  and you know  intolerance  and stuff  as being  something that's  cute and fun  and he's gonna  continue to do it  because he got so  much attention 
[01:58:30]  doing it  and like  you know  the kid doesn't  get to make  his own mind  if he wants  to grow up  and assess  people based  on what they  are and decide  he hates  homos  whatever  but like  at that age  he doesn't  even know  what a homo  is  exactly  yes he does  oh uncle paul  will teach him  but yeah  he doesn't even  know what a  fucking homo  is  it's fucked  up to me  it's like  let him  you know  dude it's  i don't know  the responsibility  of a parent  it's exhausting  fuck that shit  it's exhausting  i want the  responsibility  of having  fucking chlorine  put in my  pool  and fucking 
[01:59:00]  kegs put  in my  cooler  that's my  responsibility  children  to me it's  beyond me  i can't have  that kind of  fucking  pressure  god it's  crazy  hey uh  going back  to the guy  losing his  mind on the  floor there  the lawmaker  according to  jf in rye  new york  it was a  200 page  bill that  was given  to them  oh bill  and they  had 15  minutes to  review the  changes  15 minutes  to look at  a 200 page  bill  how is that  fucking  legit 
[01:59:30]  yeah  when a bill  becomes a law  when a bill  becomes a law  how'd that go  that one  we find that  on i don't  think that's  in the system  yeah  when a bill  becomes a law  good one  we might have  to go to the  youtube  that's a good  song  but yeah  it's weird  and these  religious assholes  get so mad  when people  attack their  religion  boy freedom  of religion  which the  country is  founded on  but man  they can't  get enough  of talking  about freedom  of religion  and they  should have  it  but man  freedom of  other things  they are very  quick to step  in and stop 
[02:00:00]  they're just  really fucking  enormous  the cheering  that went  on with  ain't no  homo's  gonna make  it to  heaven  if there  was an  anti-catholic  or anti-christian  song that they  saw that was  getting some  heat as far  as video  goes  there would  be outcries  outrage  calls for  apologies  so i  can't stand  when the church  starts this  shit with  we're right  there for  everybody to  make fun  of and  with impunity  no  you got a  pretty good  organization  there that 
[02:00:30]  begs for  those apologies  and to be  able to  just  go off  like that  kid was  and have  an audience  of adults  cheering  well how about  you leave  the children  out of it  yeah exactly  at the very  least  they love  pumping the  kids  well  pumping the  kids full  of their  religion  while they're  young and  impressionable  yeah it's  fucked up man  i feel guilty  to maybe even  push my kid  into religion  so i feel  like i gotta  at least give  them the  basics  push them  in forward  though  yeah but  it's like 
[02:01:00]  you don't even  know what to  do  religion  i know i hate  fucking organized  religion but so  i hate it i should  not uh give him a  shot at it to  i don't know what  to do  every parent thinks  that they got to  do it when they're  young and  impressionable and  get them into  what you were  into right  if you allow a  kid to reach an  age where they  can decide for  themselves if they  want to pursue a  you know a life of  a religious beliefs  right then so be  it but most don't  at that point  you know what 
[02:01:30]  it's open to  them  yeah but  it's there  yeah  my thought is  you just give  them the basics  and then let  them figure it  out  yeah  they're just  awful rituals  i think that  i don't know  for real  that might even  be too much  like why would  you even give  him the basics  well because i  don't i have  problems with  organized religion  so he should  have problems  with organized  religion  that's like  i don't know  it's almost the  same thing  it sort of is  but so  where's the  line  basics do  you give them  though do 
[02:02:00]  you give them  the basics of  judaism and  we don't go to  church buddhism and  or do you just  give them catholicism  like you were  raised i would i  would have loved to  been a free agent  i'm not even  joking  that's that would  be the best way to  do it yeah  to look at a bunch  of religions and  decide decide which  one is right for  you tell them  you don't even have  a fucking choice  you're born into  it  what if you're  born to the  wrong religion  but that's what  it is  because every  religion thinks  their religion is  pretty much the  only one right  a lot of people  going to hell  so why so then  you're born into 
[02:02:30]  the wrong religion  so you never had  a chance to begin  with yeah  think about it  i love how the  catholics though say  that uh if you're  a catholic even if  you're like you know  the wrong religion  you'll still be cool  as long as you  come to the catholic  side yeah  they're like got an  in with god  catholics  that's amazing  that's ridiculous  but that would be  the way to go is to  take a look at all  of them  but is that legal  in god's eyes if  you were born a  catholic technically  no no you gotta  go catholic  but what if  what if uh the  catholic thing is  completely wrong  like the parents  if the parents are 
[02:03:00]  catholic  and judaism was  the way to go  well see  see then i'm  fucked  so god basically  says here's what  here's what your  god does  he says that  this is the right  religion whatever it  is right  and the only way to  get into a religion  is your parents give  it to you  right  so basically if  you're born a jew  right and your  parents honor thy  mother and father  you're respecting your  mother and father  well i guess christians  say you're going to  hell because you're  a jew but then  again you're  believing in their  commandments you're  honoring thy mother  and father by  believing in their  religion that's what i  guess you're supposed  to make a decision 
[02:03:30]  and switch to  catholicism but when  can you do that  your faith in god  when you're held  accountable your faith  in god should transcend  your parents they're  just assholes but  you're not gonna get  into it all sounds  ridiculous nonsense  what if buddhism is  the way to go stories  what if what if only  only buddhists go to  heaven  is that that fat guy  that's the fat guy  yeah i don't know  if he's he's buddha  he's pretty cool he  looks like a fun guy  some people say that's  not buddha right who  is it he's the symbol  of it or something i

[02:12:00]  are you kidding  yeah  cause there's no  fucking brains in there  wow some anger  coming out today  what  I wonder where that  came from  that's strange  I hear ya  hey Daniel  what's up  or Danielle  I don't know  Danny  he's traveling  tonight on a  plane or something  hey morning boys  who  uh  yo  you guys were talking  before about  how to raise kids  with the religion  so uh  yeah  basically  you know  my view on that  like  when you're  you know 
[02:12:30]  if you believe  in a religion  that's the right thing  what happens  kid  if you believe  in a religion  you believe  that that's like  the right thing  to do  right  yeah  otherwise  we're gonna be  following it  so if you're  raising a kid  you know  you're saying  before about  let the kid  figure it out  themselves  but  you know  when they get  to a certain  age  that's all good  certain age  why you talk  funny  where you from  I don't know  my niece  had our first  communion recently  and I just felt  like she was  completely pushed  into the whole thing  she's talking  about E-Rock  Sir Tun 
[02:13:00]  Sir Tun  go ahead  attack the boss  alright  well  like I said  if you believe  that it's the right  thing  you know  everybody listen  up  the boar  is back on  I got little  kids  and I try  to teach them  you know  gives a shit  the devil  shut the fuck  up  god  I'm tired  of you already  why are you so  mad at him  cause he's  boring  what are you  saying dude  go ahead sir  step it up  step it up  go ahead 
[02:13:30]  step it up  I'm just saying  that if you  want to teach  kids what's  right  that includes  religion  if you don't  really believe  well how do  you know  you picked  the right  religion  that's my  whole point  what do  you believe  sir  just cause  you think  it's the  right  religion  you're  putting  a lot  of fucking  pressure  on your  kid  well how do  you know  anything you  believe in  that you  teach your  religion  I agree  you're right  that's why  I'm confused  by the whole  fucking thing  but just  because you  think your  religion's  right  doesn't mean  it's right  you're passing  it on to  your kids  so when my  kids are young 
[02:14:00]  and they're  still relying  on me  to teach  them  values  then  I'll  show  them  it's  your  kids  Marty  that's  the  quandary  that I  brought up  today  I don't  have an  answer  to this  but it  is a little  scary  if you  break it  down  I'm a  Catholic  I've been  taught that  it's basically  the only  religion  if you  believe in  any other  religion  you're  going to  hell  that's  what I  believe  everything's  scary  right  so religion 
[02:14:30]  is no  different  than anything  else  when it  comes to  raising a  kid  you teach  them  what you  think  is right  it's no  different  than tangible  real life  things  as opposed  to a  ghost monster  story  you're right  you're right  I think  the number  one thing  I'm going to  teach my  kid is to  have an  open mind  and try  to figure  out shit  himself  open mind  and closed  ass  and closed  that  ain't  no  homo's  gonna  make it  to heaven  I want  him to  think for  himself  that's my 
[02:15:00]  biggest  lesson for  my kid  including  religion  when I do  teach him  religion  maybe push  him toward  the catholic  faith  because I  really don't  know what  to do  I am  going to  also tell  him  I don't  know if  this is  the right  religion  you might  want to  look at  a few  other  ones  that's  how I  would  probably  handle  it  I agree  with that  but at  a certain  age when  they're  old enough  to comprehend  things for  themselves  yeah  he's  comprehending  right now  how old  is he  he's two  comprehending  he really 
[02:15:30]  understands  God  and  everything  not  not that  yet  but he  knows his  fucking  colors  and he  counted to  ten last  night  oh  colors  yeah he  knows his  colors  his  coloreds  there's no  answer is what  my point is  it's scary  because you just  assume your  religion is  right and my  point today is  is it  how do you  know for  real  you don't  how do you  know for  real that  the Jews are  wrong the  Muslims are  wrong the  Buddhists are  wrong  you know  what the odds  are that you  picked the  right one  actually that  your parents 
[02:16:00]  picked the  right one  and passed  that down  on to you  right  because you  didn't  are you the  same religion  as your  parents  well I'll  tell you  honestly  I'm sort  of the same  religion as  my parents  sort of a  different level  sort of  my parents  I'm actually  Jewish and my  parents are like  super ultra  ultra orthodox  Jews  yeah same thing  and you know  when I was young  I was raised  that way  and when I  you know  got to be a  little bit older  and I started  thinking for  myself  I realized  that I  didn't agree  with it  that you'd  only go  half Jew  so you went 
[02:16:30]  Jew light  Jewish light  yeah  you went  Jew light  why do the  Jews get to  have different  stages of  yeah yeah  what the fuck  they're Jewy  Jews  yeah  you could be  like hardcore  Jew  or you could  just be  softcore  like hotel  porn Jew  yeah you could  go fucking  you could go  diet  yeah  diet Jew  you could go  diet Jew  all the taste  but none of  that pesky  right  yeah that is  weird  other religions  do that also  not as much  as Judaism  yeah  there are many 
[02:17:00]  different stages  of Judaism  you could be  the guy that  just occasionally  puts a yarmulke  on or you  gotta be that  guy that wears  the fucking  well the fucking  Frankenstein sports  coat and the  fucking hat  well let's go  with it  you could be  yarmulke guy  with the Yankees  logo  ah  you could go  yarmulke  where it's like  look man  we don't fucking  put any symbols  on our yarmulkes  or yeah  then you can  start growing  the weird  payus thing  and really  take it to  the next level  not touch  girls when  they put  their hands  out to  shake your  hand 
[02:17:30]  you gotta  bow a little  bit  and then it  gets to a  point where  you have  sex through  sheets  that's crazy  that's not  true  is that true  I heard that  too but I  want to believe  it is so it  is  I think it's  true  alright  hey do you  wear bobby pins  to keep your  yarmulke on  I'm actually  bald so no I  don't  how do you  keep it on  then  a little glue  a little crazy  glue  it just  stays on  about 90%  of the time  sweat  doesn't that  doesn't that  cut down on  the amount  of women  you can get  99% 
[02:18:00]  I see the guys  with the yarmulke  I need to know  it's crazy  you know you  try to keep  yourself together  to you know  when you're out  there in the  dating pool  and then you're  walking around  with a yarmulke  on doesn't that  kind of cut down  the amount of  women  only Jewish  women  true  we'll go for  that and  and for the  Jewish people  that's you know  what you want  you don't want  some fucking  Schick's the  bitch coming  up to you  you know  she looks at  that beanie  and says  nine  no  I want it  right  is that true  dude 
[02:18:30]  you know  when I was  in college  I had no  problem  meeting girls  hey  knock it  off  and I can  tell you  that I've  got a friend  who actually  grew up  and he  still  he doesn't  really  practice it  but he  still  dresses  the part  why would  you dress  the part  and not  practice  wouldn't it  be the  other way  around  they are  cool  duds  and you  can have  a closet  like a  cartoon  character  where it's  all the  same  clothes  why would  you dress  that way  if you're  not  practicing  that's  the  dumbest 
[02:19:00]  thing  I've  heard  today  silly  apparently  there are  a lot  of  women  it looks  in my  second part  of the  question  whatever  statement  whatever  it looks  just so  uncomfortable  to go  around  New York  City  like that  like  a state  trooper  outfit  the fucking  heat  you're still  dressing like  one  thank you  Jimmy  something  way better  than I  was attempting  that sounds  stupid  not to  practice  but dressed  apart  and are they  Jewish girls  that were  going after  you in  droves  in college  sir  um

[02:29:00]  choice things  it's like it's  your freedom of  choice  in America  don't make it  something that  just because you  want to do it  people are dumb  though  they are fucking  stupid  whatever  let them be dumb  there are so many  fatties  let them be fat  I don't give a fuck  I don't care how  much it costs  I care how much it  costs but I think  we should stop paying  after a certain point  but they should be  able to buy the  giant beverages  of course  who do we say  you can't buy that  that's not the way  to go after a 
[02:29:30]  problem  I watched the show  the other day  it was obese  and expecting  right  and it was obese  women  that were pregnant  and had to  fucking  and the embarrassed  men who fucked  them  what show  TLC  it's one of  those  what a great  show  and it was  just  these fat  fucks  that just  they  they were  obese  but they're  they're  I learned  I learned from  the biggest loser  that if you get  a little too fat 
[02:30:00]  you can't get  pregnant  I had no idea  really  well these fucking  pigs were able  to get pregnant  right  that's for sure  and then there's  these enabling  husbands  that just are  pumping them  full of food  carting them  around  like getting  them out of  the car  walking them  into the house  instead of  fucking you know  setting them  straight  stop eating  then they  wouldn't have  a job  yeah that's  what it is  guys  guys  yep  they're part  of the problem  and they don't  want any guys  finding the girls  attractive  of course 
[02:30:30]  so they run  off on them  their insecurities  play into it  and they try  to keep  the women  really fat  and every one  of these women  had diabetes  by the way  every one  of them  had the  fat diabetes  the fat diabetes  the one you  could control  with diet  and exercise  yeah  and they're  talking about  how they  love their  babe  it's like  you don't  love your  fucking  unborn child  if you're  fat  you would  lose the  weight  for your  kid  right  I'm obsessed  with the  Bloomberg thing  I gotta tell  you  I mean  why not 
[02:31:00]  go after  beer  I don't  want him  I don't  want him  to  I hear  you though  it's  hypocritical  what is  his logic  here  you don't  know how  many people  are being  over  you're talking  about being  over served  a sugary  drink  yeah  know how  many people  on a daily  basis  are being  over served  alcohol  in city  bars  but he's  not gonna  take that  on  thank you  imagine  if he  tried  that one  thank you  of course  not  that's  why  it's  infuriating  people  want their  booze  man 
[02:31:30]  they will  not  no matter  how much  more deadly  booze is  than anything  else in this  fucking country  they won't  stop it  the ban is  to make sure  that people  don't consume  large quantities  of sugary  drinks  but people  are consuming  a shitload  of alcohol  and they've  tried  they've tried  to you know  get rid of  the alcohol  that didn't  work out  too well  it's a pretty  much made  organized crime  so they know  it doesn't work  so I don't think  they're gonna  try it again  he's a dope  but the simple  stuff they go  for 
[02:32:00]  sugary drinks  what a fucking  dope  he is an asshole  so none of  those big  two liter bottles  in the city  what do you mean  like those big  two liter  fucking bottles  of pepsi  and stuff  oh if you're  going to a  supermarket  that's done  you're not  gonna be able  to buy those  that's why  it's stupid  just go to  the supermarket  I bet you can  yeah  it's at restaurants  at fast food  joints  what  I think so  yeah  restaurants  who gets  like two  fucking gallons  of soda  at a restaurant  I'm saying  restaurants  because like  McDonald's  likes to call  their place  a restaurant  that horse 
[02:32:30]  shit  but even that  how big of a  thing do you get  16 ounces  no man  you can get up  to like 64  ounces  young Sam knows  KFC's  super size  is 46 ounces  46  but that's your  choice as a  consumer  if you won't  buy that  bucket down  motherfucker  46 ounces  46 ounces  my brother  Elmo there  he drinks  two of those  a day  oh that's unhealthy  holy mother of  God  he goes diet  but he drinks  two of those  a day  Dr. Gay  has a  he does  two of those  a day  because they  call him 
[02:33:00]  Dr. Gay  yeah  what's the biggest  one at 7-Eleven  he drinks a lot  of pink lemonade  Travis  oh yeah  big cup slurpees  right out of the  dispenser  yeah  I don't get it  it's a dick  oh  did you hear that  kid singing  about you in church  you can't go  yeah  you can't go  to heaven  because you're  a homo  I didn't know  you'll still be  able to buy them  in grocery stores  it's only places  that are  monitored by the  board of health  so if you like  sugary  hold on  if you like  sugary drinks  what is this  going to help  you're just 
[02:33:30]  going to go  to the fucking  supermarket  and get as  much soda  as you want  buy yourself  a two liter  to drink  in one sitting  it's not even  going to help  anybody  it's not even  going to help  anyone  B-Y-O-S-D  yeah like  at McDonald's  and places  their new large  drink  will have to be  16 ounces  you're telling  a business  it's ridiculous  what you can  or can't sell  again it's a  fucking  cocksucker  thought police  mayor  who didn't  want three  terms with  Giuliani  but wanted  a third  term for  himself  he stinks  he wants  to make  New York  fucking  Amsterdam  or San  Francisco  with potted 
[02:34:00]  plants all  over the  place  because he  fucking  hates  the middle  class  so why  doesn't he  ban the big  soft drinks  from supermarkets  and all that  because they're  not regulated  by the board  of health  so like  any bodega  that has  a deli  section  that has  one of  those  you know  board of  health  braids  outside  what country  oh sorry  bodega  wasn't she  married to  a dudley  moore in  the movie  no  yo  double 
[02:34:30]  go dancing  club  foot  is this a  money making  scheme  because someone's  saying that  well let's  let this guy  talk  this bitch  from PA  his name's  bitch  banger  what's up  bitch  banger  hi  jimmy  love you  long time  thank you  buddy  if  if  bloomberg  takes out  the big  huge  two liter  bottles  and you're  making a  certain amount  on taxes  you're going  to be buying  more smaller  bottles  so therefore  he's going  to be making  more tax  money  that's true  yeah but i  don't know  if that's  the motive 
[02:35:00]  a lot of  times they  do a lot  of this  stuff to  get more  fucking  revenue  but they  make believe  it's for  something else  so  that's  pretty funny  man  what  the big  gulp  is a  55  gallon  drum  a tanker  truck  yeah  and the  tower  gulp  it's a  fucking  water  tower  they really  know how to  fucking  give you a lot  of shit  to drink  at 7-11  it's a great  deal too  oh of course  it is  you know what  the average  human stomach  can comfortably  hold about  32 ounces  period  not of  anything 
[02:35:30]  that's it  right  the double  big gulp  yeah  which is what  you were talking  about  oh  that is  64 ounces  I think  that's the  one my  brother  buys  I think  so  what the  heck  for  you shouldn't  have to be  legislated  it should  just be  people  knowing  you don't  do that  you just  don't  do it  keep  booting  them off  fucking  flights  yeah  this might  be a way  to get  more money  yeah  they like  bringing in  more revenue  they love  those revenue  streams  do they  legislate  against  punching  yourself  in the  face  no  you just  punch 
[02:36:00]  yourself  in the  face  or they  make  that  illegal  because  are  people  doing  that  you should  probably  know  not  to do  it  you should  know  not  to just  drink  that much  shit  well you're  not allowed  to be a danger  to yourself  or others  what are you a cop  yes I am  shut the fuck up  why would you say  because you're  married  exactly  I don't like  your nefertini  you do look like  a fucking  Egyptian idol  stupid fucking  King Tug's mom  has something  to say  that's okay

[03:00:30]  literally  if you  yeah no  definitely  covering  right  we get it  anthony  fuck  uh  obama  44 percent  mitt romney  44 percent  iowa undecided  voters  well  hey  wow  she does  look like  that  yeah  exactly like  that by the  way  i didn't know  there was  chocolate in  the middle  of that  shit  yeah  when did  they go  with chocolate  oh the  the uh  uh  that's not  how it was  when we  were growing up 
[03:01:00]  the snowballs  always had  a little  chocolate  in the middle  god  i don't remember  the chocolate  in the middle  of that shit  unless it's  the troy kwan  snowball  right  and then it's  just coming  in your mouth  you know what  troy said that  i found interesting  yesterday  he's  what  he's  he said  that if there  was a jizz  flavored jolly  rancher  rancher  he would try  it  because  and he  was this  on the  after show  he's  just hanging  out in the  office  save great  stuff like  that  jizz  flavored jolly  ranchers  are great  and he said 
[03:01:30]  this  because  the jizz  flavoring  wouldn't actually  have jizz  in it  it would just  taste like  jizz  like an apple  jolly rancher  has no apples  in it  you don't want  the jizz  candy to say  all natural  flavors  right  he said he  would also  have some jizz  ice cream  but  with jizz  flavoring  not actual  jizz  he said he  would like  to try it  and this is a  private conversation  not on the air  no he's in the office  I hate when  Troy talks  and puts his  headphones on  at the same  time  oh god right 
[03:02:00]  in one fluid  motion  yes  fluid  jizz  he loves  jizz  he does  ever since  that girl  spit it back  into his mouth  and you'd think  he already knew  what it tasted  like  why would he  need to taste  the flavoring  of it now  doesn't make  any sense  maybe it  just has  cravings  god he loves  the taste  of jizz  he loves it  god that's creepy  no uh  let me think  a candy  no  would you eat  jizz  jilly rancher  but without  eating jizz  is a job  but it's not 
[03:02:30]  natural jizz  it's called  a blow job  it's something  that they have  to do  right  you have to  do it  I don't think  you want to  no  there's a few  weird girls  that like it  but it's an  acquired taste  I think  would you  eat a jizz  jilly rancher  no  jizz have to do it  no  would you  oh you said  would you  to jim  oh would you  oh here he is  we're just talking  about jizz  jilly  it's an old  fucking  cum taster  why would he  do this  troy  what taste  calm 
[03:03:00]  I thought we  went over this  talk as he put  his headphones on  so what is it  with jizz  and you  I don't know  I don't know  why he keeps  bringing it up  well you said  it  you're the one  that went  like all out  didn't you say  you went all jizz  you said you  would like to  taste a jizz  jilly rancher  but without  no I don't think  it started like that  I think he said  would you taste  a jizz  jilly rancher  I think you're  the one that  asked me that  and you said  you would like  to  you brought  it up  I said  that's what I'm  saying  he just started 
[03:03:30]  talking about  jizz  jilly rancher  here's where  it happened  I said  would you eat  jizz ice cream  troy  because I had  said I would  not  and troy said  yeah  why were you  thinking about  that  because I said  something about  creamy ice  you're a fucking  conniving little  shit  you tried to  fucking make it  sound like he  brought it up  because I said  something about  creamy ice cream  and somebody made  a jizz joke  and I don't  remember  whoever was in  the office  and then  I said I don't  want jizz  ice cream  and then  in reference  to the snowball  conversation  I said 
[03:04:00]  troy  would you eat  jizz ice cream  and he said  yes  and I asked  him to further  explain  and that's  when he brought  up the artificial  flavoring  and that's  when he said  like for instance  jolly ranchers  right  have artificial  flavoring  if there was  a jizz  jolly rancher  I would taste  it  he would taste  it  that's exactly  how the conversation  why would you  taste a jizz  jolly rancher  it's a new  flavor  why not  you know  would you taste  the shit  jolly rancher  sure  he's kind  of right  you gotta try  the new flavors  because there's 
[03:04:30]  that actual shit  in it  there's just  shit flavoring  right  so it's not  actual jizz  they just figured  out how to  make the jizz  taste in a lab  that's true  exactly  so what's  like jizz  skittles  I would eat  jizz  if there was  a company  that put out  something that  tasted like  jizz  they had other  flavors  and their new  flavor was jizz  I would try it  what about  jizz jelly beans  where you gotta  bite through the  fucking outer part  to get to the  jizz inside  and it's like  it's like  freshen up gum  where it squirts  into the back  of the throat  how about  freshen up gum 
[03:05:00]  but it's jizz  in the middle  it's artificial  flavoring  it's actual  jizz  we're going  artificial  but it looks  made in a lab  feels and tastes  just like jizz  but it was made  in a lab  we're not getting  it from the  jizz gushers  I mean  and they have  other flavors  that you can try  and this is  their new flavor  yeah  jerry gushers  bluegrass  trying new flavors  yeah  why not  because it tastes  like jizz  I would just  taste it  just because  it's like  what the fuck  does the jizz  flavor taste like  well you know  what jizz  tastes like  what about 
[03:05:30]  jizz coke  oh  okay that's good  jizz flavor coke  well that's  like candy  is just like  a quick little  thing  depending on  your preference  it would be  drinking like  a vat of jizz  I don't really  want to do that  what about  a jizz lemonade  uh  see again  it's a whole  chunky  how about  a jizz  flavored uh  spread like  it's  instead of  I can't  believe it's  not butter  very good  yeah I can't  believe it's  not jizz  it's the new  spread for your  bagel  like if you're  at one of  those little  sample stations  I would try  one  what about  a five hour 
[03:06:00]  energy jizz  oh  those are  small  yeah they  make you  tired but  they taste  like cum  for five  hours  right  I mean  I would  taste if  as long as  it's artificial  yeah  it's not  actually  somebody jizzed  in it  of course  not  it's always  no matter  when we talk  about jizz  it's always  artificial  okay  but  but  what if  it came  out of  a real  cock  would you  suck that  dick  if fake  jizz  splorted into  your mouth  what if  they made  like oreos  if you  held real 
[03:06:30]  balls  squeezed  fake cum  out of  those balls  into your  fucking  face  what if  they made  oreos  right  but the  cream  was jizz  flavored  yeah  and the  cookies  were regular  chocolate  cookies  but  cock  shaped  but no  they taste  like shit  they taste  like shit  but it's  artificial  but it's  artificial  fake shit  and shit  and cum  cookies  like oreos  and would  you break  it in half  and eat  the cum  filled  flavor  first  would you  scrape  your teeth  on the  cum  filled  cookie  and would  you dunk  it in  jizz  milk 
[03:07:00]  would you rub  it in your  eyes  till they get  all red  if oreo  decided to put  out the  shit  and jizz  cookie  I'd have  to try it  why would  he try it  I understand  the logic  you gotta try  a new  flat  chiming in  helping him  along  you have to  you have to  right  everybody here  would  I don't think  I would  I think  everybody would  I don't think  I would  and I think  everybody's  tried their own  cum  I think  everybody's  a fucking  liar  who says  that they  haven't  look  I said  I did  kind of  on peripherally 
[03:07:30]  that's just  what you say  so you can  say that you  did it  but you  didn't  why would  I say  I kind  of did  because  everybody  has the  curiosity  of what  it tastes  like  I've never  pumped my own  cum into  pieed my  face  my own  cum  and you're  stuck  the load  and then  licked  the outside  of the vagina  after my load  was deep  within  in your sick  world  how did  we taste  our own  cum  probably  you fucking  jacked off  and was just  sitting there  and was just  like  and I  lapped it up  or something  my fridge 
[03:08:00]  is full  at some  point  in your life  you had to  have the  curiosity  of like  oh what  are these  bitches  tasting  would you  chew cum  if it was  a nice  gum  would I  what  chew it  I mean  if it's  a new flavor  I gotta try it  would you  did you  experiment  cum  did you lick  your fingers  ever after  you jerk it  off  I said yes  I said it's  landed  I went flying  up in Atlanta  I was like  oh I'll try it  record  okay  I mean  I'm just asking  a question  yeah  Iraq what do  you think  yeah the Iraq 
[03:08:30]  taste his cum  he doesn't admit  anything  he's cum on  potato chips  he would never  ever admit  cum is too  healthy for  eating potato chips  I've tasted it  yeah  wow we finally  get an exclusive  on our show  see I  answer the  questions  you gotta dig  a little bit  who's  who's cum  mine  oh  how  how did  it happen  how did that  happen  well  oh boy  got on your  Doritos  and you didn't  want to waste  good Doritos  exactly 
[03:09:00]  we finished  I had hair  in my mouth  I went to  take the hair  in my mouth  and it was  still on my  hand  that goes to  Troy's point  it's always  by accident  whoopsie  that was another  by accident  I had a hair  in my mouth  I went to  take it out  and as I  was licking  my fingers  licking them  dry  did you ever  kiss a girl  with cum breath  yeah  yeah  on mother's  day  that's true 
[03:09:30]  it could happen  on any day  really  that's right  sorry  did you ever  snowball  no never  you sure  the most  the most  cum you ever  tasted  was when you  tried to  pick hair  out of your  teeth  it was on  my hand  so I was  like I'll  try it  oh you said  you'd try it  that's different  when I went  like this  it was already  on my hand  and I was  like oh  and I went  like that  and you licked  it after you  knew there was  cum on your  hand  so you knew  it and you  said let me  taste it  I got a little  taste I'm like  I might as  well  you're not  going to  heaven  it was not  good  here's what  happened  to a young 
[03:10:00]  child  Iraq came  on somebody  else's hand  and they  fed it to  him  like a baby  bird  he lapped  it up  with gusto  I'm surprised  he admitted  that  because you  challenged  him on it  he knew  he had to  you guys  have been  busting his  balls about  not doing  anything  on the  regular  show  that is  true  you think  you just  made that  up  to be a  hero  I think  he's  telling the  truth  but I  think  if you  guys  hadn't  been  busting  his  balls  he  wouldn't  have  fessed  no  he
