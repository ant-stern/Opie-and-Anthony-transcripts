<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a tribute to the late Patrice O'Neal, featuring previously unaired clips and reminiscences from Opie, Anthony (referred to as Ant in one segment), E-Rock, in-studio guests Keith (a police officer) and Ryan Keeley, and a phone call from Bill Burr. This tribute was interspersed throughout the entire broadcast.

The show then segued into a series of comedic interviews with Scott, a homeless man with severe facial disfigurement, described graphically by the hosts.  The interview covered Scott’s life on the streets and his medical condition. This was followed by a discussion about extreme weather events, escalating into humorous speculation about apocalyptic scenarios like a Yellowstone supervolcano eruption or a meteor strike.  The hosts and guests engaged in off-color jokes throughout this section.

Next, a discussion of country music ensued, marked by the hosts' professed ignorance of the genre and their crude attempts to analyze popular songs by artists like Dierks Bentley, Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw, Brad Paisley, Dolly Parton, Billy Currington, Trace Adkins, and Carrie Underwood.  This section included a sexually explicit video of a woman and listener calls from across the country, with some callers expressing support and others criticizing the hosts' approach.  The segment included frequent use of sexually explicit language, racial slurs, and offensive stereotypes.

The tribute to Patrice O'Neal continued with a call from Kevin Hart, who shared anecdotes about his friendship with O'Neal and his comedic style.  Opie also contributed an anecdote about finding Patrice watching pornography.  This transitioned into a discussion about Kevin Hart's career, including his involvement in a new comedy tour. The conversation included numerous crude jokes and stories about the hosts and Hart’s past, along with  racial slurs and homophobic remarks.  The discussion shifted to the movie "Snakes on a Plane," generating further absurd and off-color jokes and listener calls.

A lengthy segment followed focusing on tipping practices and perceived racial biases in service industries. The hosts shared anecdotes, using highly offensive racial slurs and stereotypes, and debated the tipping habits of various racial groups.  Renee, a caller, shared her experience of poor treatment at an Asian nail salon, fueling the discussion further.  Chris Rock then joined the show, and the conversation shifted to his career and experiences, including an anecdote about O’Neal’s audition for "Everybody Hates Chris."  The discussion turned confrontational at times, focusing on O’Neal's personality and career trajectory, with a sub-theme of an intervention for Jim Norton.  Pat Cooper joined the show later, continuing the offensive discussions on race and the entertainment industry, interspersed with personal anecdotes and comedic interjections.

Finally, a lengthy interview with Pat Cooper took place, where he reminisced about his career using highly offensive language. He criticized contemporary comedians and recounted negative experiences with various entertainers.  This segment included a tribute to Patrice O’Neal with previously aired clips and a phone call from Jim Norton, who shared an explicit story about their trips to Brazil.  The conversation continued with further reflections on O'Neal, Cooper's views on aging, and mortality.  The broadcast ended with more reminiscences about Patrice O’Neal and general banter among the hosts and guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ah, here it is.  Welcome to a tribute to Patrice O'Neill.  Some of our favorite moments from the late comedian's history on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, it's E-Rock and welcome to, I guess you could call it part two, volume two.  Pretty much like a bonus show for all the Patrice O'Neill material we have on the Opie and Anthony show  that we didn't fit into the original 16-hour tribute that we did earlier.  In this show, we should have a bunch of stuff that are not only fan favorites, 
[00:00:30]  but favorites to people here at the show.  Hopefully, if there was something that we missed last time, hopefully we got it here.  Try to give Patrice the respect and the tribute that he deserves.  Patrice, I mean, I can't do this any justice like his real close friends, the comics, have,  but I always loved Patrice on the show.  Patrice was an amazing individual.  I knew whenever we had Patrice coming in that it was going to be an easy show in the sense that 
[00:01:00]  not necessarily he would do all the heavy lifting, but we wouldn't have to do much with Patrice on the show  because you just gave him anything and he could go in every direction,  no matter what topic you were talking about.  And then we'd just ride out the show with Patrice's thoughts.  And they were always the most fun shows, too.  Not to take anything away from the comics that we had on during the announcement of his death, 
[00:01:30]  but it just goes to show to have all that talent in studio,  and it would take that and if not more to match the presence that Patrice would have in studio  and when on the show.  You needed all those people just to come close to what Patrice brought to the table.  I loved talking to him during the breaks.  We'd talk wrestling.  He'd make fun of my hair or my outfit or whatever I was doing.  And I've babbled long enough with this, so let's get this started with more of a retrospective 
[00:02:00]  of the late, great Patrice O'Neal.  Remembering Patrice O'Neal, his greatest moments on ONA.  Keith is here.  Keith the cop.  We're getting ready for the homeless shopping spree.  I think we're still doing the homeless shopping spree, aren't we?  Oh, boy.  Oh, we're not doing the homeless shopping spree?  We'd better be.  Oh, okay.  We had better be.  Is he part of the scariest looking...  I'm trying to be mature about this guy's face, man, but this is like shit.  Can we get a picture of that guy's face? 
[00:02:30]  Absolutely.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with that guy?  It looked like he was getting ready to turn into a werewolf, but just stopped.  Is that a gunshot wound?  No, I think it's just natural.  Some kind of natural...  That's natural?  That shit could happen to you?  That's like the elephant man thing.  That's why I don't like seeing this stuff, man.  That's what I'm saying.  It's disturbing.  It looked like he was almost a hulk, but he just stopped being mad right before he was  going...  He was just like...  Ah, never mind.  He's the hulk when he's just a little bit disturbed. 
[00:03:00]  Mr. McGee, don't make me angry.  I'm...  All right.  Just letting you know where my face could go, motherfucker.  That's the hulk just a little agitated.  A little agitated.  Like his breakfast order was...  It's a little agitated Hulk.  Like his breakfast order, he wanted egg whites, they gave him the entire egg.  So he's just a little pissed off.  Yeah, isn't someone trying to kill him?  Nah.  Or, you know, he's got to lift a car off of somebody.  It's like, yeah.  That's a little road rage.  You know, I wanted black coffee, they put sugar in this. 
[00:03:30]  It's a little road rage.  All of a sudden, someone cut him off, and he's like...  And then the moment passed, and you know, you've got to get to work.  Just to let you know, I am almost a hulk face.  Holy crap.  Obviously...  He looks great when he turns to the side.  Oh my God, man.  It's disturbing.  This is not fucking fair.  Patrice, look at him.  When he turns to the side, he's fine.  He's playing the motherfucker, it's just like, he's like...  It's like some kind of bone thing.  Oh no, you know what it is? 
[00:04:00]  You ever see the Hulk, the original series?  Yeah.  And it's just a monster within, and it's David Banner's half of his face.  Oh, they showed half and half.  Yeah, yeah.  That's him.  Half a Hulk face.  That's his Monica.  What is that?  Do you know, Keith?  Yeah, it's a natural thing.  It's a natural thing?  What is it, Keith?  You gotta ask him when he comes in.  There's nothing natural about that.  He has no problem talking about it.  It's a kind of bone thing.  All right, and he's homeless?  I think it's like your bones kind of grow.  The guy whose face is melting, who's he? 
[00:04:30]  That's Scott.  What's his deal?  He's one of the Port Authority homeless guys.  All right.  All Port Authority guys, huh?  And then we have Jose.  Jose?  He was a...  I don't think you guys got to play that interview.  Oh, Jose, yes.  I did the interview with him the other day.  Yes.  Yeah.  We didn't get to it because we got in so much problems.  What does Jose do?  He's just fucking crazy.  All right.  Yeah, let's hear it.  Okay.  Jose, the homeless guy that Keith, the cop, found and brought in with half a Hulk face. 
[00:05:00]  Half a Hulk.  Half a Hulk.  It's horrible.  It's just horrible.  Dude, right now he's eating an egg sandwich outside the studio.  Oh, shit.  I'm not looking.  And all I want to yell is, swallow.  Swallow.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh.  He looks like a boxing pelican.  Like a pelican with a bad...  A pelican.  A pelican that just got punched in the jaw. 
[00:05:30]  Just...  Just...  Just...  Just...  That's like what you were talking about with the plane.  His face is cantered.  It's cantered.  Motherfucker.  That thing is cantered, man.  It's cantered.  You can't land that face.  You can't land that face.  If a pilot was looking at that face, he'd be like, folks, we're dead.  We're dead as motherfuckers.  Because this shit is too cantered.  I can't wait to get that guy in.  That's...  Boy.  That was half a Hulk face's story, right?  That's... 
[00:06:00]  See, I just stopped.  Don't get the Opie and Anthony wig out.  I want to see how far we can push this guy.  Oh, no.  We found your wife.  All right.  Here we go.  We'll take a quick break, Ant.  We'll talk to half a Hulk face next.  In studio, Patrice O'Neal.  Keith the Cop stopped by with a few of our homeless friends.  We're getting ready to interview half a Hulk face.  And, man, we're learning a lot about half a Hulk face.  Yeah.  First of all...  All secondhand.  First of all, someone threw him an apple today thinking, hey, man, he's hungry, right? 
[00:06:30]  Guy goes, dude, I can't eat an apple.  I don't have teeth.  Holy shit.  Found that out.  And then we found out this other thing.  He helped out the police once with an attempted homicide in the shelter.  One of these homeless guys went up to another one with a meat cleaver and hacked it into  the back of his head, and no one came forward except half a Hulk face.  And that's when I thought, wow, maybe he had a real fine face before he turned into a snitch.  That's what happened. 
[00:07:00]  Brad Pitt, and he snitched out, and they worked him over.  No, no.  Now, you sure nobody is going to know I'm snitching?  Absolutely half a Hulk face.  Half a Hulk face.  What we've done is we've lit the area in a special way where they can only see you in  silhouette, so they will not know who you are as you testify.  Well, I saw a guy run up to, is that half a Hulk face, nigga? 
[00:07:30]  Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm looking behind this nigga snitching on me, right?  Half his face is a...  That's half a motherfucking Hulk face snitching on me.  How you know?  Nigga, look at your silhouette.  Half your silhouette is fucked up.  You're not going to be half a Hulk face anymore.  I'm going to even out that motherfucker.  You're going to be whole Hulk face after this.  Might as well paint yourself green now, motherfucker.  Oh. 
[00:08:00]  Well, I got to find out his story.  All right, let's get him in here, man.  Half a Hulk face.  Half a Hulk face entering the studio.  Shit.  There he comes.  I can't...  Don't be offended if I can't do it too long.  I just...  Take a seat there, my friend.  What's up, bro?  What's up, man?  Put on them headphones, and we got to get to the bottom of this.  How you doing?  Good.  What's your name, man?  Scott.  Scott, move up to the mic just a little...  There you go.  Scott?  Yep.  Now you're a homeless gentleman? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  What happened?  Basically, don't talk to my family.  They're a bunch of bastards, so they can kiss my ass.  Um, the only people that actually kind of helped me out are all my friends.  Yeah, but like, you had a home at some point, right?  Well, I was living in California, and...  Hosting The Tonight Show.  Fuck J.L.  Um, teasing, of course.  But you lived in California.  Here comes the photoshops. 
[00:09:00]  And then...  Holy shit, man.  But you had a home.  Yeah.  All right.  What happened that made you homeless?  I basically...  After my mother passed away.  You know, basically...  God damn it.  A little advice.  Mom, stop passing away.  Yeah, it seems like a lot of the mother thing going on a lot.  So your mom passed away.  Both of my sisters were older.  They had their family, so I just packed up my things and left.  And left without any place to go?  Well, I had a place.  But then my landlord evicted me. 
[00:09:30]  He wanted to raise the rent, so...  And you were in New York at this time?  Yeah.  So you just ended up evicted, out on the streets?  Pretty much.  And that was how long ago?  Um, two, two and a half years.  Two and a half years?  Yeah.  So it hasn't been that long for you?  No.  But you've been on the street the whole time since then?  Often on.  I stay in a bullshit hotel, paying about what...  I love the bullshit.  It's over there by the asshole arms.  Yeah.  So you stay in the bullshit hotel. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And what, for how much a night?  It's what, $120 a week.  $120 a week?  You got rats everywhere.  Cockroaches everywhere.  How do you make the $120 a week?  Any way I can.  Yeah?  You got to...  Wait, let's get into that.  Side job or...  Hey, hey, hey.  Nothing perverted now.  What?  No, I'm just asking how you make your money.  Any way you can, so that...  I go to day labor.  Day labor.  Yeah.  There you go.  You get up enough to keep a roof over your head occasionally. 
[00:10:30]  What do you do in the cold?  Same thing.  Yeah?  Just try to make enough money to stay in the hotel.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  But that homeless life is a bitch.  That it is.  Jesus Christ.  Now, I got to ask you, what kind of medical anomaly do you have going for yourself there?  It's a tumor.  It's a tumor.  It's not a tumor.  It's a tumor.  Is it one tumor?  Well, the predominant ones on my face.  Right.  But then there's other ones? 
[00:11:00]  Smaller ones.  Smaller ones.  Yeah.  And what are they like?  Can they be removed or...?  The one on my face, I've had, what, 12 surgeries since I was probably maybe five years old.  Get out of here.  Growing up, the doctor's excuse was, the reason why they couldn't take it out, was they felt  if they took out the whole tumor, that they would have pinched one of my facial nerves,  which would have caused me to be paralyzed.  Goodbye facial nerves.  Yeah, right? 
[00:11:30]  Take my facial nerve out of this moment.  And that kind of a trade-off, maybe?  Yeah.  But, as I got older, once medical science got actually better, you know, the doctors  said that those nerves had been gone for years.  Right.  You kind of, yeah, see, because your mouth...  Yeah.  Botox, anyway.  The Botox kills nerves.  So, they could have taken it out, then?  Yeah, but it was all a money issue, which it is today.  It's all a money issue.  They would be able to take that out? 
[00:12:00]  Well, yeah.  If I had, let's say, $2 million, $3 million, easily.  $2 million to $3 million?  Well, that sounds like it's pretty expensive.  Well, the last surgery, major surgery I had, it ran well over close to $500,000.  That's a $500,000 face you got?  Yep.  Holy shit.  And what did they do?  Um, the last major one, what they did was, the tumor was about maybe two inches away  from my esophagus. 
[00:12:30]  So, they had to go in there, you know, basically cut out most of the tumor, do like a, they  did a skin gram on the lower part of my right leg.  Ow.  To basically hold the skin up, so that way it wouldn't affect my breathing.  If I didn't have that surgery, I would have been dead already.  Wow.  That is some fucked up shit.  What?  Now, does Eric Stoltz ever call you and get mad that you're stealing his act? 
[00:13:00]  I'm worth the money from him now.  He stole my idea.  Yeah, you don't have a map with a lot of pins on it, do you?  Jeepers, creepers.  Do you have Cher's phone number?  Right, yeah.  That must, uh, yeah, it must be hard.  You don't have someone getting ready to put the pins back in a drawer somewhere.  It's got, it's got to be rough, right?  You know, I walk around, goddamn fucking kids pointing at you and shit.  It's got to be rough.  What is this?  What do you mean it's got to be rough?  It's got to be rough. 
[00:13:30]  It is rough.  It's got to be.  There's no question about it.  Nigga, if some of your hand was on the left side of the other hand, like, if you had a  pinky that was turned to the left off your hand, people go, oh, jeez, man, what the  fuck happened?  His face is like a broken baseball player's hand.  Right.  It's on the left, it's a half a hole.  Hulk, right, yeah.  It's half a Hulk.  And there, and because of money issues, there's nothing you can do about it.  Nope. 
[00:14:00]  Man.  You better be able to sing.  Shit, Gray Wolf can sing and ain't nothing wrong with his face.  Nick, can you sing?  Nope.  No.  Can't sing worth a lick.  And you can't eat apple?  Nope, no teeth.  God damn.  You have no teeth?  What happened to the teeth?  The surgery they did last year, the surgery they want to do now is that they want to take  out the whole tumor, and...  That's a good suggestion.  Well, yeah.  That'd be a good start.  Well, but the tumor will actually grow back.  Why?  Because, um... 
[00:14:30]  That's a chia tumor.  Fucking guy got a tumor.  You know what?  Pretty much.  The tumor itself, you know, it's like a grapevine.  The more you pluck off, the more that's going to come back.  So, the reason why they removed all my teeth was they actually got a center.  Once they removed the tumor, as I got older, the tumor actually caused the right side of  my jaw to grow out of place.  Uh-huh.  So, they actually got to break my jaw, you know, and actually reset it so my jaw's going 
[00:15:00]  to be wired shut, torched, I don't know how long.  Oh, God.  Wow.  And who pays for this?  Psh.  Um...  The state.  Taxpayers.  Taxpayers?  No.  I don't fucking, man.  Jesus, tax payers.  Pay for his face.  I don't care.  If taxes are going at that, that's fine by me.  Yeah, exactly, man.  Fucking...  I'd rather do that than some stupid program that teaches kids some stupid thing in school  they ain't gonna use.  Man, man.  Help this guy's face.  This guy's face is like...  Damn, bro.  Poor guy, what's your nickname with all your buddies? 
[00:15:30]  They gotta have a nickname for you.  Nick Honey Scott.  They just call you Scott?  No, come on.  You've heard the names.  What do they call you there, Scott?  No.  All my friends respect me.  Yeah.  I mean, of course, you can have some assholes who make fun of me, but...  Not assholes.  Your friends are gonna...  Look, if I grew up in the hood with a face like that, they would call me, you know, twisty  or come here, give me a kiss or...  You know what I mean?  Or something.  Something.  Twist.  But that's your friends.  Friends gotta tease you.  I'm a fat motherfucker.  People don't call me... 
[00:16:00]  I did a fat joke today.  I did a fat joke on me today.  They bombed, but I doofed.  You know, growing up, people call me...  People who love you, dude.  Not people who go, I'll point at you, but people who go, hey, man, you coming out, let's  go to the club, you know.  My friend...  Stroke?  No.  Those friends call me Scott.  Yeah.  Fuck.  All my friends treat me as a person.  But you had some assholes that call you names.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Growing up, we had people that call me Logjaw, Elephant Man, you know, shit like that.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Which I got in plenty of fights over, you know, growing up.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  That's something.  That is some...  And what's going on with the ear?  The ear is part of the whole thing?  Oh, yeah.  You know, it caused my right ear to be disfigured.  Yeah.  And dropped.  It's dropped, too, right?  Because of the fucking tumor.  Jesus.  Gotta get rid of that tumor.  That shit's crazy, dude.  And then it'll just grow back.  Yeah.  I mean, the tumor itself is hereditary on my mother's side of the family.  Oh.  But the only two people that's really affected by it is me and my cousin Eric. 
[00:17:00]  He had one groin on the lower part of his back.  He had two surgeries.  Then the tumor bursted.  So they actually had to go in there and do emergency surgery, you know, in order to  clean everything out.  Huh.  Huh.  Huh.  The tumor burst.  Jesus.  That can happen? 
[00:17:30]  Yep.  Could it happen to you?  So this is Christmas.  Happy holidays, everyone.  Ain't this a bitch?  Well, you know...  You know, growing up, the doctors told my parents straight up that I wouldn't live to  see my 16th birthday.  Uh-huh.  They figured sooner or later, the tumor would kill me.  I'm 31 now, so I outlived the doctor by 15 years.  Yeah.  Shit.  How would it kill you?  Just grow into your brain or something?  Well, it's actually...  At this point, you've got to be cursing the doctor.  Well, actually, it's actually started at the back of the head, you know, near the brain. 
[00:18:00]  So it starts off at the back, and it's working its way forward.  So it's working its way forward.  Is it eventually going to, like, take over the other half of your face or something?  No.  Yeah, when does it just burst?  Just that half?  Yeah, just that half.  And will it go into your brain?  All right, can we get the crazy guy in here?  Wow.  He's starting to freak me out.  Oh, that guy's dancing.  He's, like, fighting imaginary people and stuff.  Do you know that guy?  No.  Quagmire from Family Guy.  Hey, giggity, giggity.  He's doing a giggity.  Hey, giggity, giggity. 
[00:18:30]  All right, well, you're going to go on a homeless shopping spree?  Sure.  Very cool.  All right, Scott.  We're going to just get you, Scott.  Let's get the other guy in real fast.  Hang around, though, man.  You need anything?  You all set?  All right, cool.  He told you what he needs.  He needs $3 million, motherfucker.  $3 million for the surgery.  That's what he needs.  Oh, my God.  The ear is stretched.  Did you see the ear?  The ear's on the bottom.  Tell me, it's just...  Yeah, you can do it.  Come on.  The ear is down on his neck. 
[00:19:00]  Half a Hulk is like...  Remembering Patrice O'Neal, his greatest moments on ONA.  Got a good crew in here today.  We got Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  Patrice O'Neal, who's playing the Houston Improv.  But the problem is, I didn't know this.  Dallas got close to a foot of snow today.  That doesn't happen, right?  Dallas?  They don't get snow like that, do they?  Yeah.  No.  No.  Dallas?  Every once in a while? 
[00:19:30]  It may be.  So Houston's getting hit as well, I believe.  But Patrice's problem is the ice storm we're going to have in New York tonight and tomorrow.  We're going to have one of those classic ice storms.  Yeah, I might not be able to get out in.  No fucking way.  I mean, you know, I might still be able to make it.  There's a huge swath.  There's a 1,500, 2,000 mile weather swath across the whole United States right now.  This thing is supposed to be...  They said 200 million people will be affected by this storm.  Yeah, yeah.  It's crazy.  It's brutal.  Chicago's supposed to get three inches an hour.  And we're going to get like...  How many hours? 
[00:20:00]  I don't know.  Only for five minutes.  Look, we're on all over the country.  I want someone from Dallas and Chicago.  I want to know what the hell's going on with the weather.  I want someone from Houston to let me know if I'm going to get out of here tomorrow.  Let's do a call from Houston, Chicago, and Dallas.  How's that?  Yeah.  How can people not believe in God when shit like this happens?  It's just...  It makes me believe in science and global warming.  Science.  Not global warming.  But if I say the idea that this force, no matter how much we try to control it, it's unstoppable.  We're pompous as beings. 
[00:20:30]  We really think we have a lot more power than we do.  We're like one flick, one little flick away from just non-existence.  I'm going to tell you what the ultimate arrogance is of everything I've ever heard in terms of science.  It's people that predict the end of the sun.  Like 2012?  Like the sun will extinguish in 7 million...  Shut the fuck.  It could go tomorrow.  The sun could sneeze.  It can't go tomorrow.  No, it can't go tomorrow.  Not scientifically.  It could sneeze and fucking...  No, you want to know... 
[00:21:00]  It does sneeze.  ...in this globe.  How do you know there couldn't be some kind of instability deep in the sun that just all  of a sudden explodes the motherfucker?  Well, maybe, but...  It's a reactor.  We have to go with who we know about stars.  And excuse me, fucking Bill Nye.  She...  You love that job.  This is the thing.  We all repeat.  This is...  We...  We all do it.  Repeat what someone else did and go, oh, no, this is what it is.  I don't think I know a Nova knows what's going on.  Personally, that's PBS.  Do you think every time a sun explodes... 
[00:21:30]  What, the black dude?  A star explodes.  I'm not trusting no black...  Too many people have said the same thing.  Yeah.  Too many people have said the same thing.  Every time a star explodes, it had this natural progression that lasted this amount of time.  Or do you think sometimes a star just goes, fuck it, and it explodes?  I don't think stars go, fuck it.  It's like Krypton's sun.  Krypton's sun said, fuck it.  You ever throw an apple up in the air and it went, fuck it, before it hit the ground and floated?  No.  It obeys the laws of physics.  That's fair. 
[00:22:00]  That's a very fair point.  Yeah, it is.  That is a very fair point.  But I think gravity on Earth is a little more dependable than a nuclear reaction that's happening in space.  And we live it.  Based on a fuel supply and a balance of...  You're right.  So it might not be five billion years.  It might be six billion years before the sun expands and then explodes or implodes.  It's not going to be a...  It's going to be a fucking...  You've never seen it.  I have so...  I saw it in a jersey one time and I looked at it.  Nobody believed me.  We're still arguing about dinosaurs and all that ass shit. 
[00:22:30]  We don't know shit.  We don't argue.  Only religious people argue.  Yeah.  Only the dummies.  Only the fucking strict religious people.  And we people, you know...  And we shouldn't be worried about weather.  We should be worried about that Yellowstone thing.  What?  The big fucking volcano underneath the...  That's way worse than any fucking storm.  Fucking Old Faithful's getting ready to explode!  And supposedly it would take out what?  Most of the United States?  It's building up pressure like an atomic bomb!  That's way worse than a stupid nor'easter or a clipper system. 
[00:23:00]  A cute Old Faithful could kill us all very soon.  Yes!  A cute Old Faithful.  Fuck worrying about the weather and that dumb sun.  It could crash the Earth.  There's something bubbling right now under Yellowstone that could take out the United States.  But they just put a fucking rock over it.  Enough already.  Stop looking at it.  Your boy Kwaku?  Oh, Kaku.  Kaku said the Earth move.  He's so excited about what can happen in Yellowstone.  I've had 0.4 inches of some shit after this last...  It was a big earthquake in...  Yeah.  In Columbia, I think?  It's not that unnatural, though, during earthquakes for the Earth to give a little shake. 
[00:23:30]  Are we far enough east to not worry about the Yellowstone?  You know what?  That's all I want to know.  I love living on the East Coast.  I've never...  This snow right now is the only time I've ever felt like, wow, Mother Nature could put a mash on us.  Right, right, right.  But other than that, the East Coast is a very great place to live.  Yeah, we really don't get it.  Hurricanes weaken before they get up here, really.  Really?  Snowstorms, eh, you know, we're not going to get a fucking ice age. 
[00:24:00]  But we don't get earthquakes.  We don't get tornadoes.  You know, we get these little ones.  I don't know.  Snow totally sucks.  But it doesn't make me...  I hate snow.  It doesn't make me believe in...  Patrice doesn't make you believe in God.  No, it doesn't.  It's just a natural reaction.  What made me believe in God was when a Russian girl had me on my stomach.  And she was gently masturbating me.  And she put a finger in my ass.  And I went, no, no.  And before weight came out, I was coming.  That made me believe in God.  I thought I knew something.  But the seer of all spoke through her middle finger. 
[00:24:30]  And I listened.  He said, come, my son.  By the way, we got Ryan Keeley in studio as well.  That's the other voice you heard.  Michu Kaku was talking about Yellowstone.  And this guy saw the interview.  Chris in Jersey, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Welcome aboard.  Oh, thank you.  On CNN.com, there's an interview with him where he actually talks about it.  It's called Yellowstone Takes a Deep Breath.  And they show a diagram of the United States.  And I think most of fucking California is gone. 
[00:25:00]  And all the way until...  I don't know exactly where it goes.  But it's like the entire United States is destroyed.  No, I think we're safe.  Because we're way tucked away.  Yeah, come on.  As far east as you can go.  That's where we're in half.  The snow we're having now is just to say,  East Coast, you can get fucked with, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because we don't get fucked.  There's no fault lines.  There's none of that bullshit we've got to worry about.  That's why there's so many of us here.  Fucking, why do you think in Jersey,  everybody's crammed up each other's asses?  Because we're not going to fall into the ocean. 
[00:25:30]  We're trying to push away from Yellowstone.  But the Canary Islands...  Uh-oh.  That's where all these fucking snitches go.  Dude, the Canary Islands...  And, uh, uh, uh...  Let me know if I'm right or wrong here, Ryan.  Is, uh, the Canary Islands will be falling into the ocean soon.  And so much of it will fall in the ocean  that it could be a giant tsunami  that hits America from the energy of...  Really? 
[00:26:00]  ...the Canary Islands...  I will deal with that.  Uh, falling into the ocean.  Now, what's wrong with the Canary Islands?  Is that they're going to fall into the fucking ocean?  Because they have...  Here's what they have.  A series of volcanoes all through the shit.  And...  Was it East or West Coast that they would hit?  It was...  It's us.  It needs to be on the Science Channel.  So...  But I'm saying...  It's interesting.  It's really...  I'm just repeating what I saw.  It could be a lie.  They said...  But there's volcanoes and water.  Ah, right.  So...  So the water is constantly hitting the lava  and making this... 
[00:26:30]  Making the process of carving out shit  like the...  Like the Grand Canyon took forever to finish carving.  This shit is carving because it's heat and pressure.  And...  And they're saying that all that shit  could just make the side of that island  fall right into the ocean.  I saw that.  I saw that.  But the island only comes up a little bit.  It doesn't come that much out of the water.  As long as they show the earth going underneath.  Oh, really?  Building mountains and shit.  But wouldn't that just make something else pop up?  Yeah, mountains.  It just makes something pop up.  BBC News says it's...  Volcanoes.  The threat is overhyped. 
[00:27:00]  Overhyped.  BBC...  Canary Islands aren't going anywhere.  Very fair to them.  I like...  I like...  I like...  Goddamn Ryan.  Because she...  If you're ever going to quote news...  Yeah.  Quote the BBC.  The BBC.  By the way, the guy spreading...  BBC's good news.  The guy spreading the Canary Island thing  owns a stilts company  in the Canary Islands.  And he's trying to get canaries for stilts.  Stilts?  And he's trying to prop them up onto the island.  When was the last time stilts were sold to anybody?  A Canary stilt.  Stilts.  Good thing I bought these stilts. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, he's got everybody over there  investing in stilts to prop up the island.  This is the first time in my whole life...  And I live in Boston,  so we get those nor'easters all the time.  Yeah.  But this is the first time in my life,  as a man,  I'm going outside going,  ooh.  Like...  Yeah.  Mm.  Hey.  Ooh.  And then having shitty conversations with the neighbors.  Ooh.  Oh, how about this, huh?  Did you hear?  I didn't realize it.  Nothing worse than shitty conversations with the neighbors.  Oh, look at the weather we're having. 
[00:28:00]  You've got to say something,  because you live next to them.  Never.  Ever.  I don't speak to my neighbors.  Good for you, man.  Ever.  Good for you.  Because I refuse to be the one that's not speaking.  You're not speaking to me either,  so fuck you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We're not speaking.  Good news for the East Coast.  The Yellowstone thing,  when it blows...  Won't hit us.  Won't hit us,  but the ash will.  That's fine.  We'll be buried under a lot of fucking shit.  I don't care.  The people in my luxury building will clean it.  Clean the ash, scum.  When the meteor hits,  the ash doesn't really bother me at all. 
[00:28:30]  Nah.  Ash.  What do you think it's going to be?  Do you think it's going to be the sun?  What's going to kill us?  Yeah.  It's going to be us, right?  I think it's going to be Monsanto.  It's going to be nukes.  No, because George Carlin did that bit about  plastic plus earth.  The earth is just very adept at saying  go fuck yourself.  No, what takes us out, though?  I think the earth.  Genetic engineering.  The earth.  I think of a devastating earthquake,  a tsunami.  That takes the whole world out?  That does something. 
[00:29:00]  Could be a crazy fucking meteor strike.  Yeah.  I don't believe in meteors, though.  You don't?  How do you not believe in meteors?  They're not a myth.  No, I don't believe that there is a  You can go to believe in zombies,  but you should believe in meteors.  I think a big rock.  As a matter of fact,  there's another theory that I don't believe,  that if they fire the giant stop-you-meteor  nuclear missile,  that it won't destroy it.  I believe it'll destroy it.  The idea that a missile hits that meteor,  a nuclear missile hits that meteor, 
[00:29:30]  you see what a fucking nuclear missile did  to the Independence Day mothership.  Yes, I get it.  It will fucking blow that bitch up.  No, well, what would happen if it was fragmented?  It would fragment it.  And pieces of it.  What they're going to do is  It's better than the fucking giant one.  They're going to set it off in front of it  or next to it.  So the shockwave right at the beginning,  when it's far enough away,  diverts it.  So if you're 20 million miles away  or 10 million miles away  and you divert it,  then the path changes and misses Earth.  They're not going to blow it up.  They can't blow it up.  And we need about 50 years of warning 
[00:30:00]  or some shit, too,  to have a chance to try to stop it.  What they're actually going to do  is put somebody out there with a flag  pointing in a different direction.  So the media turns.  I don't think a media would destroy Earth.  I don't think there's a dinosaur destruction  fucking media.  I think it's going to be fucking with our food supply.  I think it's eventually going to poison us.  And I think that, you know...  With us?  Well, yeah, what they're doing with corn right now.  You think we're going to fuck away?  I think we're going to kill ourselves  with genetically engineered corn and meat.  What about some kind of play?  Monsanto, yeah.  Yeah, Monsanto. 
[00:30:30]  Because you mess up that food supply,  then where do we get food?  They're already genetically engineering...  But Monsanto's trying to control food.  But they're doing that to try to kill us anyway.  And their strains are taking over  natural occurring strains.  And then these strains also are not germinating  without new seeds being purchased.  The goddamn Germans got nothing to do with it.  So I'm smoking the bag.  So you're into the New World Order and all that stuff.  I'm not in the New World Order.  I do...  Well, that's what you're talking, lovely.  Okay.  Monsanto's a little bit different than New World Order.  Monsanto, man. 
[00:31:00]  Monsanto is all a part of it.  Who do you think made your tits?  Exactly when you died as growing in the earth.  Monsanto.  It's just going to be you and your tits,  your bones and your titties,  killing us.  Do you know that we stopped degrading in the ground, too,  because of all the preservatives in our food?  That keeps me out.  That people are opening up graves  and there's completely fucking preserved people  in the ground because of Twinkies and shit like that. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, mummies did it, too.  We're not going to...  And that was a whole process.  We're going to colonize.  We're eventually going to colonize in space.  And we're going to eventually become more mobile.  Where are we going to colonize in space?  Twinkies, thank you.  Where are we going to...  Moons of Jupiter they're looking at?  Okay, yeah, Europa has a minor, minor chance  of actually having life on it.  Yeah, Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter.  And the ice there isn't even made out of, you know,  what we think of as something that would make ice and water.  I like the fuck you with an encyclopedia on top of your head.  It's a chemical slurry.  It's just like, I would love to fucking watch  you read an encyclopedia. 
[00:32:00]  It's not lying.  They will eventually colonize other places.  How about we just planet, transform fucking Mars?  It's got CO2 atmosphere.  That's what you heard.  You heard that shit from Total Recall.  No, no.  That shit don't have nothing.  No, but it's CO2.  So you CO2, trees breathe CO2 and let off oxygen.  That's what they're saying.  So over years you make Mars an oxygen atmosphere.  Mars ain't got nothing but red rocks.  Yeah, and the trees would die  if you strapped them to the outside of the fucking ship  and take off Mars. 
[00:32:30]  Mars ain't shit.  Why would we ever go to fucking Jupiter  on the fucking moon  where Jupiter's nothing but a giant, deadly gas ball?  And then how do you get your sunlight?  Like you're behind Jupiter sometimes,  you're in front of the sun,  you're behind Jupiter.  You manufacture it.  You manufacture it.  You can do anything.  Your days would be all fucking willy-nilly.  Too many movies, man.  What manufacture?  If you could live...  I'm the man that thinks we're going to blow up  a meteorite with a nuclear.  We actually...  I'm telling you,  we are eventually going to learn  how to be mobile and slow. 
[00:33:00]  Is that sarcasm towards me or me?  Is me?  I didn't say...  Are we getting science  and now you're coming to the rights?  I think that a lot of the shit they say  is horse shit.  I don't believe in everything that they tell me.  I don't believe that a media killed the dinosaurs.  And if it did, it was whatever.  But I don't think a media is going to kill us.  You see that hole  where that media is supposed to...  That hole...  How did that hole kill everything?  I don't give a fuck.  There might have been a larger hole  somewhere else that was covered  or it might have been in the ocean 
[00:33:30]  that it hit.  It's fucking...  Literally, it blocked out the sun.  It would be great.  They say where the whole gulf of fucking Mexico  was made by just a fucking meteor.  And those poor dinosaurs  was walking around.  Look at the moon's surface.  But the dinosaurs didn't have doctors.  Maybe...  Maybe if they had doctor dinosaur,  they would have fucking cured the cold  that killed them all.  And...  And...  Time out.  Time out.  Fucking...  There's a bunch of dinosaurs  running around the goddamn earth anyway. 
[00:34:00]  Rhinoceruses...  That's a dinosaur.  Are fucking dinosaurs.  I agree with you.  Alligators.  Alligators.  Crocodiles.  I agree with you.  They're fucking dinosaurs.  They lived.  Some of the birds.  Condors.  Skeletal.  I'm telling you.  And they had to shrink  to be able to...  Because before,  when they were brontosauruses,  they had to eat  a tree a day or whatever.  So they had to adapt  to be able to eat a bush a day.  They did...  One thing he's saying  that's right,  they did find a dinosaur bones 
[00:34:30]  and they dug it up  and they thought it was a fake  because they noticed  he was holding the New York Times.  You know, like,  no dinosaur  would read that liberal rag.  Wait, so you think...  Opie, you...  So, Ryan thinks  genetic modification.  We're going to kill ourselves.  Right.  I don't count ourselves as...  No, I came up with this.  Give me some kind of plague.  I think a natural occurring plague  from just too many people.  China will fucking 
[00:35:00]  fuck something up.  It's going to be  the zombie apocalypse.  And there's so much...  Oh, I can only dream  of a zombie apocalypse.  That would be great.  Other than dying,  that would be fun.  I would love to see  the end of the world.  Other than being a part of dying  and the screaming,  I would love to sit on my porch  and just watch...  Watch the apocalypse.  I want the Tina Turner  Mad Max outfit  with, like, the chain mail.  Really?  I got a machete  in my bed.  You want post-apocalyptic?  Oh, hell yeah.  To hang on as long as you can?  She's a sneaky...  She's a globalist...  Like a... 
[00:35:30]  She believes in all this creepy shit.  She don't talk about it  because Penhouse says...  I do not believe in that creepy shit.  Penhouse says,  Ryan, don't talk that crazy shit.  Don't talk that crazy shit.  Just show your ass.  Yeah.  Don't talk about your ass.  Don't talk too much.  Very nice.  Too much...  People...  Just rub it out.  Just shut my mouth.  Hold my tits out.  All right.  Show that coach.  Put your nipples out  and don't talk about it.  Here's how much  she's upgraded in my head.  She's a globalist.  She's into the new world  and shit, right?  Global banking  and all that.  She believes in all that  because she knows  about Monsanto. 
[00:36:00]  But she shows her twat,  right?  Little hair on it  and her tits  and it makes me go,  now I can listen to you.  And I'm like,  oh, she's fucking...  If I didn't see  your little hairy cooch,  I'd be like,  hey, shut up.  This is the thing.  It's about what I like.  Now, I'm looking at a close-up  without spray paint  and everything.  She has...  This is the thing.  Black guys love shit like this.  Yeah.  She has some stretchy marks, man.  Little smaller.  On the booty cheeks, man.  But they look delicious. 
[00:36:30]  This is so real.  Yeah, that's a real ass right there.  Amazing.  And it's hard,  hard as a rock  but jiggly.  My goodness gracious.  There's no dimples  going on there.  She got a little bush on her.  This dumb video guy  gets to fucking  have that glory  in his face all the time.  Okay, man.  Battlestar Galactica is...  What'd you think?  Did you like Buck Rogers?  I'll talk about Twinkie all night.  If you tinkle on me,  I'll do Twinkie. 
[00:37:00]  B-D-B-D-B-D-B-D-B-D.  Oh, shit, dude.  Stay tuned.  Our tribute continues  with more moments  from Patrice O'Neill  on the Opie and Anthony Show  after this.  We continue  with more of our tribute  to Patrice O'Neill.  Hey, what's up?  This is Bill Burr  and you are listening to  a tribute  to Patrice O'Neill  who is the funniest  stand-up,  funniest human being  I ever met. 
[00:37:30]  And if you're just  flipping through the channels  and you happen to catch this,  please keep listening  because this guy's the best.  He's the best.  All right.  Remembering Patrice O'Neill.  His greatest moments  on ONA.  There's like hardcore  country fans  that listen to this program.  And we got nothing  for you.  I'm sorry.  We just don't get it.  We don't understand it.  I used to.  I'm tired of your fucking  city slickers  and your whole shit. 
[00:38:00]  I couldn't tell you  the top country song  in America.  I couldn't even get  one of them.  I couldn't even get  one of the top ten.  It kind of crossed over  for a little while  when Garth Brooks was big.  Right.  It was a big country crossover.  Remember?  Like all of a sudden  somebody you knew  started wearing cowboy boots.  I was more of an  achy breaky heart guy.  You.  No, I'm just kidding.  My girl lost her foot  in a lawnmower accident.  That's number one.  That's the number one song?  By Bootny. 
[00:38:30]  By Bootny.  Carnesby.  Billy Bob.  By Billy Bob Russell.  My girl lost her foot.  Hello, I'm Billy Bob Russell.  Give me the top ten  country songs in America  and we'll do a little riffing.  I was into the country  way back when  when I was growing up  because I was out west  and I rode horses.  So my father always  had it on in the truck.  But that was your  old school country. 
[00:39:00]  You know, your  little red alignment shit.  But everybody liked  that old school country.  Old school country  was like super crossover.  Like, you know,  you just, you know  old school country songs  because they're not really  like country kind of thing.  Yeah, it was pretty  it was like  I think the big crossover  back then was  the Stand By Your Man.  Stand by your man.  Or the coal mine  his daughter.  Don't matter who  he's fucking  just keep on  sucking  on his cock. 
[00:39:30]  That was the whole song.  Stand by him  don't matter what he does.  Island's in the stream.  Yeah.  Fucking anything  by Charlie Pryde.  He might punch you  in the face  but  Stand by your man.  Show the world  you love him.  As they throw him  bottles at the  fucking screen  on front of the stage.  Roll him up.  Pull him up.  Pull him up.  Beautiful.  Oh, hide.  Hit him up.  Yeah.  There was some  big country songs  back then. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Now I don't even  know who the fuck  is.  Iggy Break Your Heart  was the last  thing that  crossed over into my  You would know  Garth Brooks songs  wouldn't you?  I know not one.  No?  Whatever his most  famous song is  that I should know  I probably don't know it.  Really?  But Iggy Break Your Heart  I knew.  What was Garth's  biggest hit?  What was his  biggest hit song?  I don't know.  You don't even know?  Well, maybe Patrice  wouldn't have.  Patrice knows a lot  about white culture though.  I'm from Boston dude.  You really studied it.  And I'm corny.  I have a corny streak  where it's like 
[00:40:30]  a lot of that shit  is just like  I do like  It scares me sometimes.  I think maybe  you're a spy.  The only problem I have  is calling it a culture  for other than that.  Oh, really?  We're the top 10  country songs.  We just want to  go over the list.  No culture.  I just like hearing  what y'all did with  our shit  and turning it  into your shit.  Yeah.  That's pretty interesting.  Alright.  We love stealing  from the black man.  This is really  the number one song  in country music, huh?  Let's start with  number 10. 
[00:41:00]  Are these albums  songs or  or songs?  Songs.  Songs?  Does Derek have the list?  Maybe we can play  a few of these.  Number 10.  Top country song  in America right now  is a song.  The house next door  to me was so  what?  No, that isn't.  And Garth Brooks  is on the list.  He's still doing shit.  Man, there's country fans  right now laughing at us.  Tim McGraw.  I heard of Tim McGraw.  Yeah.  He's like one of those guys  who's big enough  to have crossed over 
[00:41:30]  into my ears.  But I don't know  his songs, though.  George Strait.  You know George Strait?  Well, I got...  Man, fuck all that.  Get to the...  Alright, well, I got it.  The number 10  country song in America.  Here it is.  A Little Taste.  Yeah, that's not it.  God damn, motherfucker.  What is that shit?  What happened?  Just wrecked my own fucking...  You ruined your bit.  God damn it.  Is this the chick 
[00:42:00]  from fucking...  Yes, it is.  Are you serious?  Yes, it is.  She's got the number one  country song in America.  Wow.  Harry Underwood.  You're joking.  Alright, the number 10  country song in America.  You got it, Derek?  Oh, it's awful.  I've heard this one, right?  You know this one?  Yeah.  A band called  Little Big Town  and the song is called  Boondocks.  I meant Carrie Underwood's song.  Oh.  Yeah.  Let's hear this.  This is the number 10  country song in America.  Oh, wow. 
[00:42:30]  Let's hear it, boys.  This is good cousin fucking me.  I feel no shame.  I found out of where I came from.  I was born and raised in the Boondocks.  One thing I know, no matter where I go, I keep my heart and soul in the Boondocks.  In the Boondocks.  And I can feel that muddy water running through my veins. 
[00:43:00]  I can feel that muddy water running through my veins.  Look at the trees just laughing at this shit.  This is a little sprinkle of Parcher's family in there.  I was feeling it to the Parcher's family.  I can feel that harmony came in.  Hey, I can feel the muddy water running through my veins.  Reuben Kincaid should be right around the corner.  Man, it just...  Yeah.  Man, it's just...  White people still have a black people game.  Boondocks is our term.  That's a black man's term.  Boondocks.  The boonies.  That's number 10.  The boonies.  Got the muddy water running through his veins. 
[00:43:30]  I'm with the trees on that.  I was kind of feeling it up until that harmony kicked in.  And then it got a little corny.  All right.  Shields and...  Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Sha-na-na-na-na.  Let's go with number 9.  Top country songs in America.  We're trying to educate ourselves and...  Yeah.  All right, all right.  And our listeners out there.  It's very good of us.  There's a band called Sugar Land.  No clue.  And the song is called Just Might Make Me Believe. 
[00:44:00]  Going for the heartstrings.  Yeah.  I got miles of trouble spreading far and wide.  Bill's on the table getting higher and high.  There's always a problem.  They just keep on coming.  There ain't no end in sight. 
[00:44:30]  She might have to...  Bill's due.  No end in sight.  She might have to sell her body soon.  She's holding on.  I got someone who loves me more than words can say.  Oh, boy.  And I'm thankful for that each and every day.  But it can't pay the fucking bills.  He loves you because you have a tight snatch.  That's about it.  There's no other reason to love you, baby.  Who are you kidding? 
[00:45:00]  Still is hard to find face.  Here it comes.  But if you can look in my head...  Now, what's the definitive thing that makes this genre what it is?  Like, what is the thing that makes this country music?  What is that thing?  You know how rap is like...  Oh, it's obvious.  You know, hip-hop is like, you know, a good downbeat and a rap. 
[00:45:30]  You know, whatever.  But what's the definitive...  A relatable story.  But no, to have that sound.  It's a sound.  What's the sound like this?  Is it that...  That line?  A steel guitar is important.  Some kind of like...  No, I think it comes...  A plotting beat like this.  I think it's all about the lyrics and the story first.  But you can put these lyrics to...  Because this doesn't sound like a country song.  Yeah, but it is.  You can hear country.  You can just hear it.  It's not like a pop.  Listen to the background. 
[00:46:00]  Listen to background music.  It's that, like, bluesy thing going on.  Yeah, most country songs, I'm sorry, are essentially mechanically the same song.  You know, like, they're constructed the same in terms of the way the chord progressions go.  It's the story that is crafted around.  So Ope's right.  But you could put the story and the lyrics to a hard rock song and it's not country.  Right, and it's not country anymore.  Well, Leonard Skinner had that thing, but when I listen to Free Bird, I don't feel like 
[00:46:30]  I went over to...  Yeah.  This is if I leave here to...  It doesn't sound like this...  It's got southern roots in it, that whole Leonard Skinner thing.  And so does country.  It's a very bluesy...  It's the mechanics of the song.  The way the harmonies are.  What was that song about anyway?  I don't know.  She can't pay her bills.  She's kind of like just holding on.  Yeah.  And this person she's in love with is the one that's going to make her believe everything  will be okay.  Because it's not about money and all that. 
[00:47:00]  She's happy to be mediocre.  Yeah.  But then she drinks her margaritas to kind of make things...  Who doesn't?  All right.  Let's go on.  Drunk mediocrity.  That's what that song is about.  Let's go on to number eight.  There's a bit here somewhere.  We're going to try to find our way in the middle of this here.  Top ten country songs in America.  Number eight is a guy named Dierks.  Dierks Bentley.  Dierks Bentley.  I'm Dierks Bentley.  I'm listening to my album.  Coming a little closer. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  All right.  Dierks Bentley.  Pleasure to meet you.  You think the truckers in Alabama are just like, go ahead, fellas.  And they're just driving out.  How are we going?  Man, these guys, they're just multi-multi-culture.  And just listen to this horse shit.  And they're looking up into space.  It's fucking somewhere that's still dark in fucking Utah.  And he's fucking driving out.  Going, man.  Exactly.  Don't you make fun of the girl from Sugar Land?  Right.  Bitchy McGillicuddy.  She's a beautiful woman.  That was my goddamn wedding song, you motherfuckers. 
[00:48:00]  How about we play a little game.  Dierks Bentley.  Come a little closer.  What do you think this song is about?  Well, it's an alien from outer space.  And Dierks Bentley teams up with other people in the squad.  And they kill the alien.  I'm Dierks Bentley.  I'm Dierks Bentley.  Dierks.  Dierks.  Dierks, get to the chopper.  Get down.  Get down, Dierks.  Come on, Dierks.  Do it.  Now.  All right. 
[00:48:30]  So what is Come a Little Closer about?  Come a Little Closer?  Self-explanatory.  Yeah.  A little love thing going on.  He's a...  Okay, ready?  It's a girl.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It's a girl who he's been trying to get for a long time.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And he just wants her to...  She's wary.  Because this is now...  It's 2006.  Bitches are wary of man love.  God damn.  This guy's got...  This was exactly what I was going to say.  And she's wary of man love, and he's just like, look, I understand that you're a little  nervous, and you think I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing, but I love you. 
[00:49:00]  And you'll see that.  Come a little closer.  You'll see that.  If you just come a little closer, you see that I'm Dierks Bentley.  Dierks Bentley.  So that's what it's about, you think?  That's what I say.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's listen to Dierks Bentley.  Come a little closer.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, it's Pink Floyd.  Welcome to Machine.  All right.  Come a little closer, baby.  I feel like laying you down.  Oh.  Going for the balloon knot.  Date rape song.  On a bed of sweet surrender. 
[00:50:00]  Work it all out.  Uh-oh.  What's the problem?  This guy stinks.  He said, tell us the problem right here.  Let's listen to what the problem is.  There ain't nothing that love can't fix.  Okay.  Girl, it's right here at our fingertips.  I thought it was going to be Dicks.  So come a little closer, baby.  I feel like laying you down.  Laying you down. 
[00:50:30]  I feel like laying you out.  Be more accurate.  Come a little closer, baby.  Need another verse.  I feel like letting go.  He's got a big jar of Vaseline.  He's going to punch her in the asshole.  Of everything that stands between us.  What's the problem?  And the love we used to know.  Okay.  The problem.  They were in love.  Rediscovering each other.  I want to touch you like a cleansing ray. 
[00:51:00]  And let it wash all the hurt away.  I got it.  Pause this.  Pause it for a second.  Here's what the problem is.  Yeah.  We were thinking too complex, Patrice.  Yeah.  Here's the problem.  They got all kinds of problems and issues.  They were in love, but this guy probably sounds like an asshole.  Yeah.  Maybe cheated.  Probably did a little cheating.  Hit her a little bit.  With the waitress down at the greasy spoon.  Right.  The greasy spoon.  She's willing to give up the blue knot, and this little filly isn't. 
[00:51:30]  And in his simple Dierks Bentley mind, he thinks, once I fuck you, it's all going to be fine again.  Like, I know we got problems, baby, but just get in the bed.  Wait a minute, Anthony.  Get in the bed.  I learned a thing or two from the waitress down at the greasy spoon.  I'm going to show you what I learned.  You got to take calls from the actual motherfuckers who know.  Who know this stuff?  Who actually know what Dierks is talking about.  Dierks Bentley, come a little closer.  I'll even lick your ass.  I'll go, man, you don't have a goddamn clue what he's talking about. 
[00:52:00]  What he's saying is.  Well, let's see what Ken in New York has to say.  Ken, you know this song at all?  Hello?  Hi.  Do you know what Dierks Bentley is talking about in Come a Little Closer?  No, not really.  But I got to defend this country music, guys.  We're not bashing country.  We're really not.  We're basically telling you we have no fucking clue what it's about.  It's kind of like little big town boondocks until they sounded like the Partridge family.  You know what, guys?  I'm from New York, born and raised, and I got into country music three or four years ago.  I can just fucking identify with it.  I don't know what. 
[00:52:30]  I can't even explain it myself.  Oh, really?  Thank you.  I want to go to Ty in Alabama.  Ty?  Yeah?  What's up?  Y'all boys taking this shit a little bit too far now, ain't ya?  Goddamn.  It's all right.  We all messing with the spook up there.  Goddamn.  Y'all fucking with my music now.  See?  The second we hit the Midwest, it's over, Johnny.  They can't take the joke now.  I love when you were with the Puerto Ricans this morning and the Mexicans.  That shit's funny. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, you got to call a spade, a spade, a chick, a chick.  But you can't mess with dicks.  Don't fuck with dicks, Bentley, goddammit.  Yeah, but see, if I was a listener to this program, I'd be enjoying how clueless your pals  Opie, Anthony, and Patrice are when it comes to country music.  Well, the whole thing is, his name's Dierks Bentley.  It ain't Dierks, it's Dierks.  Oh, Dierks.  It's Dierks to us.  He spells it D-I-E-R-K-S.  I'm Dierks Bentley.  Does it matter?  Does it really matter?  All right, wait.  Well, we got to find out what's going on. 
[00:53:30]  I think there's more to this story.  So, thank you, T.  Or, Ty.  Ty, thank you.  I'm fucking out.  All right, don't take it seriously, though.  We understand that it's someone's music out there, but we're just trying to tell you we  have no fucking idea.  Hey, look, if we was on here just trying to deconstruct rap, okay?  Right.  Motherfucker, they'll be out there.  Yeah, dude, let's do that.  Are you in tomorrow?  Yeah.  All right, we'll do that.  Let me tell you.  I can never understand what them knowledge is.  Exactly.  That's who you get, but you're fucking their country music.  We're trying to teach it, right?  We're trying to learn. 
[00:54:00]  I'm trying to learn about this goofy-ass music.  I want to be educated.  All right, tomorrow, we'll do the opposite.  We've got to find the top ten rap songs in America.  Right.  Deconstruct it.  I'll tell you what else.  We're just fine.  We just need some kind of music.  I'll do it right now.  I don't even have to hear the songs.  Four of them somebody's getting smacked, and three of them somebody's getting shot.  That's right.  Somebody's getting shot, somebody's getting...  And then in between, he's going to talk about his rims, and his fucking gold around his  neck, and his gold visus.  Oh, wait a minute.  Okay, if you're going to say that, I bet you there's a running theme in this horse shit, 
[00:54:30]  too.  All right.  Well, there must be a running theme into this.  You're right.  All right, let's get back to Come a Little Closer, because...  Dierks or Dierks Bentley.  Dierks Bentley.  Let's get back to the song.  Come a little closer, baby.  I feel like letting go.  Letting go.  It's okay.  Of everything that stays between us, and the love we used to know us. 
[00:55:00]  All right, he's going to fix it.  I want to touch you like a cleansing ring.  Cleansing ring.  And let it wash all the hurt away.  Oh, this guy fucked her up.  I should come a little closer.  And now he wants her back.  He's going to fix it by fucking her.  What a guy.  What a guy.  What a trooper.  Let's forget about all that shit I did to you. 
[00:55:30]  How do you feel now?  Remember the good banging I used to give you.  All right, that's enough of that little ditty there.  There's Dierks Bentley and Come a Little Closer.  Some guy is just.  And they don't want us to talk over because some guy is just going, man, you know.  I sure like this song.  Man, what a great song.  Who's the pig with the hos?  Let's say, let's move on to the next.  The big guy?  Let's. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, that is a big guy.  He is big.  Did Patrice just fall on the floor?  Yeah, Patrice just fell on the floor.  He actually.  See, his evil Opie comes out.  Patrice, you all right?  Oh, fuck me.  Get up off the floor, man.  We can't pick you up if there's a problem.  Oh.  Ow.  I'm sorry.  What's wrong, man?  Oh, my God.  It's just perfectly said what it is. 
[00:56:30]  Just his fat face with all these tins.  What is he, the support team?  All right.  We'll get into the hotness that's outside the studio in a little bit.  But we're in the middle of a fine, fine bit here.  Oh, God.  Top country songs in America.  Number seven is good old Garth Brooks.  Yeah.  And Good Ride Cowboy.  All right.  What's this song about?  Oh, hold up.  We got to figure it out?  Yeah, we got to figure it out.  Yeah.  But it's Garth, so it's probably just about being a cowboy. 
[00:57:00]  Just having a good time.  Yeah.  Good time.  Fun.  Oh, it sounds fun already.  Nothing bothers me.  From the hills of KC, Wyoming, where life's really and wild.  In the Navy, Brad, in a cowboy hat, in that cold, with a Hagen smile.  Yeah.  And from the Bronx, honky-tonk, she always sang a cowboy.  Cowboy song. 
[00:57:30]  We were much too young.  Having too much fun.  As we all sang along.  And we sang a lot.  Say, highway.  There's only one way you're going to get through.  When she starts to twist.  Be more like Chris.  Pull your hat down tight.  And just look, do it when that whistle blows.  And the crowd explodes.  And him pick up in her hat.  I don't get it.  That's a nice, that's one of those things they do, their variation of the electric slide. 
[00:58:00]  What do those crackers do?  What do they call it?  Line dance.  Line dance.  No, that's a little crack of line dance song there.  Where they'd lift their boot and give it a tap with their foot.  And then all turn.  And the girls with the skirts and the cowboy boots.  The skirts and the bunts.  Horrendous hairdos.  Butt and diddle-dees.  Tickle, tickle.  Ha, ha, ha.  Fucking.  A good time.  Make me like this shit.  Right.  Sell it. 
[00:58:30]  Don't just come and go, oh, watch your mouth there, nigga.  Make up.  That song sounded fun, that's all.  Steve.  Steve knows what that song's about.  Steve likes fucking country, huh?  I do.  That was a, I think that's a tribute song to the late Chris LeDoux, who died of cancer  last year, I believe.  Who is he?  Chris LeDoux was another singer.  And he was a good old cowboy.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm Chris LeDoux.  All right, we're going to move on, because we want to try to get through this here.  Number six.  Top country songs in America. 
[00:59:00]  You sold out Chris LeDoux.  We're trying to educate ourselves here today.  Oh, I can't get enough of that shit.  We love Arnold.  Let's say hi to Tim McGraw.  Tim McGraw.  My old friend.  What's my old friend about?  His dog.  This could be, oh, very good.  His dog?  His dog.  This could be, now, Tim McGraw, son of Tug McGraw.  Right.  Tug died, I guess they hadn't known each other for a long time.  This could be a father attributes all about his dad. 
[00:59:30]  My old friend.  What I say is about an inanimate object, it's not a human, it's either a truck, his favorite  truck, his fucking dog.  Yeah.  Maybe his, I don't know Tim that well, I would say his gun or something, but probably not  his gun.  Not his gun.  But something like a truck.  His old friend that never lets him down.  Yeah.  And it's never a human being that never lets you down.  All right.  It's always something else that lets, humans let you down, but not your fucking, not your 
[01:00:00]  old, not your old, your old something, your old thing with the thing and then over there.  So you're saying some type of machine thing.  Ope is saying somebody that says his old hound dog, and I'm saying it's going to be maybe  dear old dad.  That has nothing to do with a woman, right?  No woman.  No, no woman in this one.  Tim McGraw, my old friend.  Let's take a listen.  A little up-tempo. 
[01:00:30]  Up the intro.  Maybe it's just about his old friend.  All right, let's take a listen.  They laugh and they cry me. 
[01:01:00]  They somehow sanctify me.  The woven in the stories I have told.  Until again.  My old friend.  I apologize.  For the years that have passed since the last time you and I dusted all those memories.  This is an old friend.  Now, Patrice, I pause it. 
[01:01:30]  Pause it.  Patrice got something.  I'm telling you, listen.  It's hanging on his wall.  He's being clever.  It was since I dusted off.  No one dusts off their fucking buddy.  You understand?  You think?  He dusted off the thing.  It's a thing.  I'm telling you.  You think it's still going to be a thing?  I don't fucking know.  It's hanging on the wall.  Maybe in the chorus he talks about it.  Maybe it's pictures of memories of him and a friend.  I think it's his old friend that he just doesn't call anymore.  Just a buddy?  Maybe we're overthinking it again.  Maybe a friend, he doesn't know how to quit. 
[01:02:00]  I don't know how to quit you.  You know what?  When we was on Brokeback Mountain, I was fucking you in the air.  If this doesn't turn into something clever that, like you said, then the rest of these  songs, whatever it says, if it says Sugar Land, I want to say it's about sugar.  All right?  No more credit to country music if this motherfucker's talking about just his buddy.  All right.  Let's hear.  Let's go.  Back to my old friend.  There's always somewhere else I had to be. 
[01:02:30]  Time gets thin.  My old friend.  Don't know why.  Don't know why.  Don't know why.  Oh, you don't know why.  Uh-huh.  Don't know why.  Oh, someone's saying it's a deer head on his wall. 
[01:03:00]  Done.  That's it?  No, who cares?  It didn't even say what.  I'm not.  I think it's about the fact that Tim used to have some fine friends, and then he became  this huge country superstar and kind of didn't forget about his friends, but didn't have time  for his friends because he was too busy traveling America and becoming this huge country star  and realized, oh, my God, my old friend. 
[01:03:30]  My old friend.  He would never write a song dedicated to some guys that he left because he got famous.  Could be.  I don't know.  Jesus.  He didn't say anything.  It was vague.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if that was to his old friends, they're so vague, they wouldn't sit there and go,  ah, Tim, remember me.  It's like, who the fuck is he talking about?  What?  All right.  Let's go to number five.  Top country songs in America.  Brad Paisley featuring Dolly Parton.  Holy shit.  Brad Paisley. 
[01:04:00]  Hello.  I'm Brad Paisley.  Pleasure to meet you.  Arnold, what is this song about?  This is called When I Get Where I'm Going, I'm Going to Kill Something.  Featuring Dolly Parton.  Really?  Dolly Parton's in this one?  Yeah.  When I Get Where I'm Going.  What's this about?  Where I Get, When I Get Where I'm Going.  Is it a physical trip or is it something that's going on?  I'm going to keep it simple.  Spiritual.  It's a spiritual trip. 
[01:04:30]  It's spiritual.  I still give it credit.  Come on.  Come on, country music.  Guy's a trucker and he's hauling something and when he gets where he's going, I'm going  to get paid and buy some beer.  I'm on Route 66, headed to Route 82.  That's where I'm going and when I get there, I get paid.  I get paid.  Well, my Peter Belt is running. 
[01:05:00]  When I get where I'm going.  When I get where I'm going.  That's a spiritual journey he's on.  I'm thinking.  I'll say spiritual.  Spiritual?  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  When I get where I'm going, on the far side of the sky, the first thing that I'm going 
[01:05:30]  to do is spread my wings and fly.  I'm going to land beside a light.  I'm going to land beside a light.  I'm going to land beside a light.  Run my fingers through the sky, run my fingers through his mane.  Where I might find out what it's like to ride a drop of rain.  Yeah, when I get where I'm going, there'll be only happy tears. 
[01:06:00]  I will shed the sins and struggles I have carried all these years.  And I'll leave my fingers.  And I'll leave my heart wide open.  And I'll leave my heart wide open.  I will love and have no fear.  Yeah, when I get where I'm going, don't cry for me down here.  I'm going to walk with my granddaddy. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, he's got cancer.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's got the big C.  Oh, fucking come on, man.  God damn.  Don't say that.  He's giving a positive spin to cancer.  No fucking way.  Essentially, he's going to be up there with granddaddy.  Oh, and I'll hug his neck.  Yeah, when I get where I'm going, there'll be only happy tears. 
[01:07:00]  See, because usually the sad tears when a loved one dies.  But don't worry about him.  He's going to be all right.  I didn't see this guy.  He's going to be with granddaddy.  All right.  All right.  Enough of the cancer song.  That guy's not dying.  That's a dying song.  Let's go to Amanda in Brooklyn.  Amanda, what's the Brad Paisley Dolly Parton song all about?  Well, usually the newer country stars like to link up with an old one to do some type  of tribute song or something like that.  And it's pretty much about going to heaven and what it's going to be like. 
[01:07:30]  It's pretty basic.  That one's an easy one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not dying.  No, just talk about what it's going to be like when you get there, just dreaming about  it, I think.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Yeah, I know.  Pretty depressing.  All right.  Thank you, Amanda.  Thanks.  Have a good one.  All right.  Let's move on to number four here.  We're almost done.  Billy Carrington.  Billy Carrington.  That was a movie I did in 96.  I was Billy Carrington. 
[01:08:00]  The song's called Must Be Doing Something Right.  Must Be Doing Something Right.  This is him counting his blessings.  Yep.  This is what it is.  This is an absolute love song.  I got a girl.  She's wonderful.  He's maybe got a good career.  He's got this.  I must be doing something right.  Life is good.  Right.  It's just about the love of his life.  Just a girl?  You think it's just a girl?  Just a girl.  Must be doing something right.  Absolutely just about a girl.  All right.  All right.  That's good.  I'd say it's general blessing. 
[01:08:30]  General blessing?  Yep.  I'd say it's general blessing he's got to be in the position he's in.  Because you never heard of it, this guy's new, and it's like, thank you to show business  for letting him do his dream.  Uh-huh.  No girl.  All right.  There's no girl involved.  Not a girl.  I'm saying this is all about a love life.  Okay.  Must be doing something right.  Billy Carrington, everyone.  A woman is a mystery that I just can't understand. 
[01:09:00]  Sometimes all it takes to please her is a touch of your hand.  Yeah, the back of it.  Other times you gotta take it slow and hold her all night long. 
[01:09:30]  Heaven knows there's so many ways a man can go wrong.  Here he comes.  Now.  Must be doing something right.  I just heard your sigh.  You leaned into my kiss and close.  Those deep blue need you eyes. 
[01:10:00]  Don't know what I did.  That's really bad stuff.  I told you it was all about a girl.  Yeah, you're right.  All about a girl.  He figured out.  That guy can sing to this guy.  It's like.  He figured it out.  Smooth voice.  Yeah.  He figured out it's not all about the fucking.  He figured out it's the little things you do.  Yeah, rub the little things.  The little hand holding and the little kisses on the neck.  Rub the clit in a counterclockwise motion.  It's about the little things.  Right.  A little spit on the tip and just rub it slow so it doesn't fucking scratch. 
[01:10:30]  Clip your fingernails.  I think he's talking about.  I clip my fingernails just the other day.  When I touch a vulva, I make sure my hands are clean.  I touch your vulva with clean hands.  I touch your vulva with clean hands.  Well, I've been at the coal mine all day. 
[01:11:00]  And my nails was a little dirty today.  I took the brush and cleaned them out real well.  Now I'm touching your vulva tonight with clean hands.  We're going to do it with Dolly Parton.  Touching your vulva tonight.  You'll be touching my vulva tonight.  Everybody.  You want to do it with Dolly Parton? 
[01:11:30]  Touching my vulva tonight.  I'll be touching your vulva tonight.  Clean hands.  You'll be touching your vulva tonight.  And here come the lighters.  The lighters are out.  Everyone's swaying back and forth in concert.  With clean hands.  That's what it's all about.  He's very caring. 
[01:12:00]  Raquel, what's up?  You guys are killing me with this crap.  I hate country music.  You guys are killing me.  See, there's a way to listen to country music.  Oh, I hate country music.  But have you noticed that it always goes, with country music, it goes from one extreme to the other.  You have like a party life and then it goes to somebody dying.  I absolutely hate country music.  Yeah, there's no real in-between.  All right, thank you.  Yeah.  But we nailed that song. 
[01:12:30]  It's about touching the vulva right.  Yeah, with clean hands.  With clean hands.  With clean hands.  Clean hands.  Woo!  That was with clean hands.  You heard it here on the country station.  With clean hands.  That's the name of the song.  With clean hands.  With clean hands.  Oh, my God.  That was just taking off.  What do you think this is about?  Oh, well, I don't know.  Maybe it's about, you know, a guy who was, you know, he killed somebody and now he's trying to, you know, refine himself. 
[01:13:00]  He's washing his hands of all bullshit he's ever done.  Right, right.  He was bad and now he's cleaning his hands and his soul of the, no, he's touching our vulva with clean hands.  With clean hands.  We've got a song for Grey Wolf to record.  He's been touching my vulva tonight.  Ah, Croc.  We told you we'd find our way around this bit. 
[01:13:30]  Don't worry about it.  Croc, what's up?  All right.  We lost Croc?  I don't know.  Something's a little weird with the phones today.  We lost Croc.  All right.  The next country song, top country songs in America.  Number three is Trace Adkins.  My buddy on the chopper last mission was Trace Adkins.  Get out.  I'm Billy Carrington.  Pleasure to meet you, Trace Adkins.  We're to drop into the drop zone at midnight. 
[01:14:00]  Me and Trace Adkins will take the left side and I want Dx Bentley to outflank the enemy.  Don't forget about Brad Paisley.  Brad Paisley is my right hand man.  You will put on the big gun.  Holy shit.  Well, Trace Adkins has a song.  It's number three in the country as far as country songs go. 
[01:14:30]  It's Honky Tonk, Badunkadunk.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  They've incorporated some urban language.  Badunkadunk.  Why not?  Honky Tonk, Badunkadunk.  And I know it's sarcastic.  It's got to be.  It's a sarcastic fucking shot at rap like that.  Right.  But now, real Badunkadunk is down here in Hula Hula, fucking Minnesota, wherever the fuck  I'm from.  It's going to be very upbeat. 
[01:15:00]  Well, the colored folk came up with this word, but we're stealing it now.  It's a Honky Tonk, Badunkadunk.  Honky Tonk, Badunkadunk.  And it's Honky Tonk.  That's what I say.  It's a Honky Tonk, Badunkadunk.  And we're talking on a whore of the hit.  This song's going to show that it ain't cool with the colored folk no more. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, shit.  Well, here it is.  It's Trace Adkins, Honky Tonk, Badunkadunk.  I don't think this is it.  The house next door to me's been sold to niggers.  They claim to be wild Indians from the plain.  All but they ain't a-chucking me, they're colored people. 
[01:16:00]  Black people are claiming to be Indians.  God damn.  That was the latest from Trace Adkins.  With a bullet.  Well, that was number one with a bullet.  Number one with a noose.  You know what we mean by a bullet.  Number one with a noose.  All right, well, let's play the real Trace Adkins, Honky Tonk, Badunkadunk.  Yeah, it's going to be very upbeat.  Uh-oh. 
[01:16:30]  Come on, now.  Turn it up, son.  Yeah.  Turn it up, son.  Foxy, lady.  All right, boy.  All right, boy.  This is her favorite song.  You know that, right?  So we play it good and loud.  She might get up and dance again.  Oh, she put her beard down.  Here she comes.  Here she comes.  Oh, boy.  Left, left, left, right, left.  It's one of those country dance songs.  Yeah, line dancers.  I'm trying to come up with a new fucking dance.  Hustlers shooting eight ball. 
[01:17:00]  Throwing darts at the wall.  Feeling down there ten feet tall.  Here she comes.  Lord help us all.  Old T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him out his chair.  Poor old boy, it ain't his fault.  It's so hard not to stare at that honky tonk.  Badonky tonk.  Oh, yeah.  He's got a ghetto ass.  How's it going on like Donkey Kong?  What?  Ooh.  Shut my mouth. 
[01:17:30]  Slap your grandma.  There ought to be a log.  It's a sheriff on the phone.  Lord have mercy.  How's she even dancing?  Reggie's on.  Badonky tonk.  Badonky tonk.  Yeah.  I kind of like this one.  Got to call the sheriff.  Her ass is so hot.  Did you hear that?  All the cops on her ass.  Got it.  This is no crime in that town.  It's starting all kinds of trouble at the local gin mill down there.  She comes in.  The guys are getting slapped by the girls. 
[01:18:00]  They got to look at that ass.  All right.  Here we go.  One more to the hook.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Oh, I'm seeing the line dancing of this shit.  And the white girls add a little shake now in their line dancing.  Yeah.  That one little badonky tonk turn.  They got to show that ass.  I guarantee the dance is all about some kind of ass shake.  Oh, yeah.  It's a new line dance going on somewhere.  All right.  The honky tonk badonky gonk gonk gonk.  We're almost done here. 
[01:18:30]  Number two.  Hot country songs.  The top country songs in America.  Good old George Strait.  She let herself go.  This could go a lot of ways.  Oh, my God.  All right.  What is she let herself go on?  This could be hot.  That's the comeback song for a honky tonk badonky gonk gonk.  My girl used to have one of those things that Tracy was talking about, but this bitch is fat and steak now, and I'm going to take her out back and hit her with a pipe. 
[01:19:00]  She took for granted her honky tonk badonky gonk.  He took for granted.  She figured she could eat a few Twinkies and nothing was going to happen to her badonky gonk.  Oh, man.  But she let herself go.  How is it going to make this positive?  Oh, my God.  You know they're going to turn it around.  All country songs end positively.  I made her sleep in the yard in one of those big tires I got back there.  So how does this song go? 
[01:19:30]  She let herself go.  They met.  She was all hot.  And a few years go by, and she just let herself go.  Absolutely not.  And is this George Strait going to say something like, and that's okay?  Absolutely not.  No.  No.  She let herself go.  She fell in love with him.  You're thinking.  I know.  You're thinking.  I refuse to believe these country motherfuckers will not do some clever wordplay.  There's no way he's talking about how his fucking girl got fat. 
[01:20:00]  She used to weigh 115, now she's 275.  Let herself go.  That's all right.  She let herself go.  She's as big as a truck.  I don't want to fuck.  Because she let herself go.  She let herself go.  Even when I wash my hands, I don't want to touch her vulva.  Because it's dirty. 
[01:20:30]  She got a dirty vulva.  She used to wash her vulva.  But she let herself go.  She's the size of a vulva.  She let herself go.  All right.  So she obviously let herself go.  Is he okay with this?  No.  He's not okay with this.  There's no way a song about him.  It's a country song.  He's okay with this.  When his fat woman is okay, there's no fucking way.  He's going to say that beauty is inside, not outside.  A hunky-tonk, but dunk-a-dunk, could not be the next song underneath She's a Fat Bitch. 
[01:21:00]  This song is a hunky-tonk, but dunk-a-dunk.  She's a fat bitch, and he's okay with that.  That's what this song's about.  It can't be.  You're saying she finally let herself go and is now into him.  I bet $10.  Throw your $10 down.  I guarantee this is not about a fat bitch.  Huh?  I guarantee this is not about a fat girl.  This is not about his girl did not fucking get fat.  You can't.  I'm going to tell you what I mean.  The third song is hunky-tonk, but dunk-a-dunk, right?  The people are saying that the second song is George Strait, who is a known motherfucker, 
[01:21:30]  is not going to say and have the second leading song in the world.  Rappers don't have songs about you fat bitch.  This George Strait is a hard core.  Yo, check this out, son, and I'm going to tell you I'm not a snitch, but I don't like  that fat bitch.  You better get out my face, hoe, and go to the motherfucker's store, and she let herself  go.  This bitch let herself go, son.  You guys are so wrong.  Now is no fucking way he's talking about a fat girl. 
[01:22:00]  This is talking about how beauty's on the inside, I guarantee you.  All right.  Let's hear it.  Okay.  Let's hear it.  All right.  And it's going to be pathetic when we find out.  All right.  That's what I'm thinking.  All right.  And what did you say?  I say it's just what it is.  She let herself go.  This bitch was hot when he met her, and now she's a fat piece of shit.  That would isolate the female country fans.  Don't matter.  No, that's what I'm saying.  The fatties are buying these records.  The fatties are buying these records.  This is the number two country song above Hunky Tonk, Badonkadonk, which is a shout 
[01:22:30]  out to hot asses everywhere.  These redneck girls with these scrawny booties, right?  Okay?  They're trying to teach their women.  George Strait, who is a...  I've heard of him, so he's a mainstream fucking guy.  He's been in the biz for a while.  There's no way he wrote a song that my bitch is fat.  I feel so good about this one.  All right.  Let's hear it.  This is a bitch that's fat.  He don't care.  Beauty's on the inside.  Hit it.  Fuck that.  Go ahead.  Uh-oh. 
[01:23:00]  Sound insensitive.  Could be in trouble.  Yeah.  This is no party song, boys.  This is not a fat bitch song.  This is no party.  Honky Tonk, Badonkadonk.  He wondered how she'd take it when he said goodbye.  Come on.  I'm in.  You're in so far.  Hold on.  She might do some crying, lose some sleep at night.  Come on. 
[01:23:30]  This is great.  Ditch the bitch.  But he had no idea when he hit the road that without him in her life, she'd let herself  go.  Oh, shit.  Let herself go.  Singles' cruise to Vegas once.  She's a hoe.  She's a hoe.  Fucking everybody.  I told you I'm not a fat bitch.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  A week at the spa, came back, knocked out pretty. 
[01:24:00]  When he said he didn't love her no more, she let herself go.  Oh, so she just left.  Left.  Let herself go out there.  But he left.  He dissed her.  And he might have dissed her for being fat, but he's not saying that.  This is an unempowering woman song.  She let herself go.  I don't want that if we bet.  I thought I was in.  Spent her days raising babies.  There's some iron in his pants. 
[01:24:30]  All right.  Iron in the pants.  Fuck him.  It's a fuck him song.  That a guy had written.  Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note.  All right.  And without him there to stop her, she'd let herself go.  Let herself go.  On her first blind date, had the time of her life with some friends at the lake.  Let herself go. 
[01:25:00]  Close your mouth, oh.  This is great.  Motherfucker.  She's a ho.  There's no way he was writing about a fat bitch.  He obviously didn't take a relationship that seriously.  That's right.  This is the cleverness I was looking for in country music.  There you go, George.  Let me tell you something, though.  I'm feeling from what he's saying that she was a piece of shit.  To her husband, maybe.  But he never made that clear.  And then when he ditched her because she was, you know, he come home, she's ironing the pants,  she's got the kids, she's fat ass.  And he ditches her. 
[01:25:30]  She hots herself up at the spa and starts fucking everybody.  Wordplay.  It was wordplay.  Yeah.  And not fucking everybody.  It was like she was a good woman.  This is his song.  If she was a good woman, this nigga didn't appreciate her.  Yeah.  Got on the road.  And then she's like, you know what?  I'm going to make myself better.  This is an empowering woman.  She let herself go.  Go and be a better person.  Close bag.  No way.  No way the number two song.  That's a number two fucking punk ass song. 
[01:26:00]  I'm not happy about that.  I really wasn't because I thought, you know, he's ditching her at the beginning of the song.  I'm like, I'm in.  The fat bitch song is on the B side.  In 1950, she let herself go.  The other side is that fat bitch.  This is why I let her go.  Like Roxanne, Roxanne.  That's the reason.  All right.  Let's go to Jim in Wisconsin.  Jim, what's up?  Yeah.  That honky tonk for donkey donk.  You guys hit that right on the head.  If you see the video, it's all about a bunch of guys in the bar and a girl shaking their  ass.  You hit it right on the head. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Right on, man.  It's the country party song of the year.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Watch it out.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Bill in Pennsylvania.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Make it fast, Bill.  A long time listener.  First call.  I used to be a country DJ, and I think you guys are trying to dig a little too deep in  figuring these songs out.  Because none of these people are, very few of them anyway, write their own songs to begin  with.  And if it's a band, very rarely does the band actually play on the song itself.  It's studio musicians. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Let Herself Go is, She Let Herself Go is definitely a good word play there.  Yeah.  Tony, Tennessee?  Hey, man.  Y'all are killing me this morning.  We are right up amongst all this redneck music.  And the hypocrisy in that if it was, you know, Jay-Z singing some of the lyrics that's being  sung, people would be freaking out on a lot of this stuff.  Oh, man.  A black guy could easily sing a song called She Let Herself Go, by the way. 
[01:27:30]  Hi, baby.  The video stops on, baby, what's up?  Who's this fat bitch?  Oh, shit, it's my girl?  Bitch, you let yourself go.  Absolutely.  You let yourself motherfucking go.  They bring it right at you.  They don't do word play.  Oh, shit.  All right, let's get to the number one country song in America.  It's lovely Carrie Underwood from American Idol.  Carrie Underwood.  Wow.  She's got the number one song in America now, huh?  Wow.  American Idol does good things. 
[01:28:00]  Good things.  Yeah.  This is Jesus, Take the Wheel.  Wow.  I've heard this one.  Is this the one that a lot of controversy with American Idol?  Because apparently they want, no, it's not.  I'm an asshole, Travis.  Is that what you're saying?  That's Kelly Clarkson.  That's Kelly Clarkson.  Yeah, Kelly Clarkson had a little controversy.  You would think they would want this number one song, though, for this season.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Carrie Underwood.  Jesus, Take the Wheel.  Ugh.  Well, there you go.  This is so bad.  Say, your life is so out of control, and you've just lost it all. 
[01:28:30]  Just let, you've got to put your faith in God.  Doesn't it sound like it should be that?  That's not it?  No.  No.  It's literal.  It's literal.  It's literal.  Jesus grabbed the wheel.  Why?  She got all...  I can't fucking drive.  It's a tribute to her thing.  She got all fucked up?  Her American Idol thing.  It's a tribute to, like, her dreams coming true.  No, no.  I mean, I'm driving.  I'm fucking...  Can you take the wheel from me?  What?  The car is skidding.  But is she drunk?  Jesus.  Jesus. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, literally, the bitch is driving.  Jesus, get on the anti-lock brakes.  So there's a Puerto Rican in the car.  Really, this is Jesus, Take the Wheel.  I have no idea.  You don't know what it's about?  I'm saying it's literal.  No.  Oh, stop.  Jesus, take the wheel.  Her life, no, needs a little spiritual help.  Not needs.  Jesus, put it in four-wheel drive.  This is a thank you.  It's snowing.  She already had her help.  This is a thank you.  She doesn't...  This bitch is not coming out saying...  You're trying to tell me that Jesus is a designated driver?  Jesus, my tranny light's on.  What do I do?  Jesus, I need oil. 
[01:29:30]  It's about Jesus, Take the Wheel.  Jesus, check the alternating.  Jesus, slow down.  You're making me nervous.  You're driving too fast.  Aw, this is...  You might be immortal, but I could still hurt my ass.  We're leaving on an up note, but this is going to be very obvious, very boring, and we're  just going to have to...  Oh, you might be immortal.  You might be immortal, my mother.  You're all right, but I'm scared shitless here in the left-hand lane. 
[01:30:00]  You drive like you're insane.  This is going to be like that dumb poem with the four fucking footprints, and then there's  two, and where were you, and I really needed you.  Well, that's when I was carrying you.  That's what this song is all about.  So, so far, what is...  Would you agree with this list?  Would you reverse anything, put anything...  We don't know.  It's all the same to me.  This is the same stuff.  I think Billy Curranton... 
[01:30:30]  I think Billy Curranton is good.  All right, let's go to Carry On, and get this over with.  Jesus Take the Wheel.  Number one country song in America.  A little violin in there.  It's nice, right?  She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati on a snow-white Christmas Eve.  There you go. 
[01:31:00]  Going home to see her mama and her daddy with the baby in the backseat.  Baby's in the backseat.  Fifty miles to go when she was running low.  Aunt's going to nail this one.  There we go.  She's giving false hope to people.  It's been a long-hearted year.  It's been long.  She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention.  She was going way too fast.  Too fast.  Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass.  Black ice.  She saw both her lives flash before her eyes. 
[01:31:30]  She didn't even have time to cry.  She was so scared.  She threw her hands up in the air.  Oh, that's real smart.  Jesus Take the Wheel.  Jesus Take the Wheel.  Did he take the wheel?  Did he take the goddamn wheel?  Let's listen and find out.  No, apparently not.  Wow, man. 
[01:32:00]  Wow.  You know, have a little survival instinct and steer into the skid, you stupid bitch.  Oh, wow.  Stop giving false hope to everybody out there with your number one song.  Literally, Jesus Take the Wheel.  Well, I believe it's been a hard year, and literally, she wants, you know, Jesus Take  the Wheel.  But figuratively speaking, I think she's giving herself up to Jesus right here at this moment.  With a low point in her life.  A low point in her life.  She took her shoulder and the car came to a stop.  Oh, oh.  Jesus Helper.  She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock. 
[01:32:30]  And for the first time in a long time, she bowed her head to pray.  Ah.  She said, I'm sorry for the way.  I've been living my life.  Ah.  This is the bitch that's from the last song.  So from now on.  The husband left.  She's out whoring.  Jesus Take the Wheel.  See, now she's not skidding anymore, but she's still saying. 
[01:33:00]  She has just surrendered her life to Jesus.  And as far as her life goes, does that work out?  No, that didn't work out either.  It sounds like it worked out.  It's a shame.  Did she die in this song?  No.  No.  She made it.  She believes in her faith, and look, it did her well.  She sounds good, though.  I think she should.  She can sing.  I think she should pray to Goodyear Tire, because that seemed to be what saved her in  that situation.  Jesus taking the fuck.  I can't do it.  Maybe the bitch should stop putting on makeup as she drives, and she would have been all 
[01:33:30]  right.  Jesus took the wheel.  There you go.  Lord and Savior.  I have learned things, and I...  She had Jesus in her back pocket.  Jesus pulled one of those, like, 180 moves, spins the car, puts it back in drive.  He jumped out the window, did a roll.  Oh, it was great.  He jumped over the drawbridge.  He's driving like it's the Italian job through the sewers that Jesus can drive.  Jesus can listen to saves.  See when it clicks.  He's a sale cracker.  This worked out very well, so the listeners got to remind us to bring this bit back when 
[01:34:00]  it's a whole bunch of brand new songs.  Brand new ones.  Because these songs will stay in that list for a long time, so maybe a couple months  down the road.  Where was Jesus when Dale Earnhardt was driving?  Holy shit.  Where was Jesus then?  Jesus, take the wheel.  Nope.  Nope.  Sorry, pal.  Nope.  I'm too busy saving some other bitch that can't drive on a light sheet of ice.  Sorry there.  Number three.  A lot of people are saying, Jesus, take the wheel.  Yeah, because Jesus made a joke.  She said, take the wheel. 
[01:34:30]  He goes, you want me to come and shoot her?  Yeah, exactly.  Why?  I was just joking.  Why Dale Earnhardt drive?  Jesus, take the wheel.  No, I'm busy here.  I made a little joke.  Oh, my God.  More of our favorite ONA appearances from the late Patrice O'Neal after this.  We continue with more of our tribute to Patrice O'Neal.  Hey, what's up?  It's Troy from Opie and Anthony, and I'm going to talk a little bit about Patrice.  You know, these past couple days have been really hard for everybody, and I just was 
[01:35:00]  very fortunate to have met and known Patrice a little bit, and working for the show, you  get these moments of time where you get to work with him on something, or you have to  deal with him in something, and I always knew that they were special when they were  happening because he was somebody that I've never met before in my entire life.  So I even just, I kind of treasured those moments while he was alive, and now that he's 
[01:35:30]  gone, I treasure them so much more.  And Patrice is actually responsible for me doing my first major production piece that  I turned into the Opie and Anthony show called Side Pussy.  And he just went on this rant about Tiger Woods and having girls on the side, and it was  just something that was just broken down in just dude language.  And every guy thinks that way. 
[01:36:00]  Every guy, you know, maybe most guys would like a girl on the side of their wife or their  girlfriend, and they don't even have to be the hottest one.  They don't have to be as hot as your wife or your girlfriend.  They can be a couple steps down.  And he just, he broke it down like I've never heard anybody do.  And it was such a long piece of audio that I just thought to myself, I need to make a song  out of this.  And the world needs to hear it because it's that fucking funny. 
[01:36:30]  And I hope I did it justice.  I know that the material there, you could play without music and it would be amazing.  But I tried to put it to some sort of music for, I don't know, my ode to the great Patrice  O'Neill.  And so, Patrice, thank you for everything.  Thank you for being amazing.  Thank you for changing my life personally.  And you're going to be missed unbelievably. 
[01:37:00]  Remembering Patrice O'Neill, his greatest moments on ONA.  Kevin.  What's going on, guys?  Kevin Hart, man.  What's up, man?  This is a nice surprise.  How are you, brother?  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  You hanging in there?  Yeah, man.  You know, because times could be a little better.  Yeah, no shit, huh?  Due to the circumstances, but I can't complain.  Yeah, this one just fucked.  We've been saying it all week.  This one just fucking hurts.  If people don't know, Kevin Hart knew Patrice O'Neill real well. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  This was a, dude, you know what?  I can't even, I don't like to be down, dude.  But this one, this one hit me a little hard.  You know, it definitely, you know, we can't say that it was a shocker because we knew he  was in the hospital.  We knew that things definitely weren't great.  But, you know, reality doesn't hit you until, until you, you're really, really smacked in  the face with it.  You know, in our mind, it's like, all right, well, he's in the hospital, but he'll be all 
[01:38:00]  right.  Big dummy will be good.  You know, it's not that serious or, you know, it's a matter of time before he's out back to  himself.  And, you know, after a while, you just didn't hear nothing.  You didn't hear any news.  You didn't hear any good news or bad news.  So the way that I'm thinking is no news is good news.  And then literally Monday, you know, he was smacked with the whole, wow, Patrice, he passed  away.  And dude, I honestly, I just sat down and canceled my day.  I didn't do anything. 
[01:38:30]  I talked to Keith for a while.  So in reality, hit me a little later.  You know, you, as a man, you don't like prime as a man, you don't like it, but it's weird  when it actually comes out because you realize the one that you're closest to doing that.  I lost a good one.  I really, really lost a close friend.  So it was a low blow.  Yeah.  It's okay.  I still haven't been able to wrap my mind around this at all.  I've just been walking through the last month, just numb.  It kind of sucked that we couldn't give anyone updates because we sort of knew right from 
[01:39:00]  the beginning that this stroke was a motherfucker and people were all trying to stay positive.  We all just knew what the outcome was going to be.  Unfortunately, you never know.  You always hear those stories where it's like, wow, you know, it was supposedly really bad,  but then, you know, something happened.  People, you know, will bring up the word miracle.  Right.  And you always hope for that.  Absolutely.  Um, but, uh, in this case, uh, that never happened.  And, uh, yeah, it's, it's such a fucking bummer because, uh, he was just, uh, you know, 
[01:39:30]  and, and Collins had a one of a kind, you know, uh, there's, there's no one even close  to being like him, you know, he's, he's irreplaceable, um, in that way.  That's funny you say that because that's what I say when, when reality hits, you know, you,  you realize exactly what a person was worth with, what their self-worth was and what they  meant to the business.  And, you know, when, when it comes to standup comedy, man, you, the one thing that comedians 
[01:40:00]  attempt to do is pride themselves on originality.  You know, everybody attempts to be different.  They attempt to be clever.  They attempt to be witty, you know, or, or smart or groundbreaking.  And people really don't understand how, how groundbreaking Patrice was, you know, from,  from dealing with the business, from not wanting to be the guy that was Hollywood, from refusing 
[01:40:30]  to let agents and managers dictate his career to, to not being afraid to tell people to  shut their mouth.  Like if they, they were out of line, like the man definitely was, uh, he, he was on  a different plateau, man.  And, you know, I think now people are honestly going to understand what that man's worth was  to comedy, you know, after going back and looking at his body at work.  So it's sad that we got to miss it, miss him this way for people to realize it.  But, you know, I, I think now people will honestly understand the talent that Patrice 
[01:41:00]  on that was.  I said it earlier.  He's going to be massively huge in death, unfortunately, when they, they should have  realized when he was alive and he was about to hit on his own terms.  He was right there.  Finally, on his own terms, he was going to make it the way he wanted to.  And that hurts too, you know, cause we all know that he, he definitely wanted that.  Very true, dude.  Very, very true.  Yeah.  Now you guys are going to witness me.  Try not to cry.  And if I do cry and you repeat it, I swear they got him a punchbow. 
[01:41:30]  I mean, I've seen a lot of tough guys, uh, cried in the last week.  Yeah.  It's just been, it's been so, so tough because, uh, yeah, he's just so fucking original and  different.  And you, you take it for granted when, when he's, when he was in here doing the show,  you took for granted everything from his, his big, dumb, booming laugh to, you know,  his take on relationships and shit like that.  And then when you realize that you never, you're never going to get that anymore, it  becomes really, really sad, you know? 
[01:42:00]  And he was, he was, he was never not funny.  Yep.  Never.  I mean, whether the mics were on, the mics were off, or we were just hanging out in the  street or just taking an elevator ride, he made interesting everything.  He was always on.  You be on, you have to be on true.  Yeah.  Beyond it, man.  Beyond the dude.  Well, you know, uh, like I said, I don't like to be the Debbie downer.  You know, I believe that, uh, when, when, when things, uh, like this happen, you have  to find a positive, uh, as some, some place. 
[01:42:30]  So, you know, my positive is simply, I'm honestly happy and blessed to say that I was a friend  of this man, you know, with, with this loss, I'm, I'm trying to, to deal with it as best  as I can, but you know, let's, let's take the time to celebrate that man's life and what  he's done.  Oh yeah.  If you are a Patrice O'Neal fan out there and if you, you know, if you were affected  by it at all, just go back and understand if he really was here, Patrice is the type 
[01:43:00]  of dude that'll tell you to shut up and stop crying about it and get over it.  You know what I mean?  I, I, I, knowing that well to where I know that that will come out, man.  So, you know, I can't do nothing but express my love, my condolences to his family and friends.  You know, I'm, I'm going to do what I'm supposed to and be there as a friend and support those  other, you know, the other guys that are there.  And as comedians, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's funny because things like this is what  bring us all closer together.  So, you know, we're going to pull together and do what we can for, for his family, you 
[01:43:30]  know, outside of the funeral just to make sure that they're okay.  Because like I said, we, we lost, we lost a close one.  So for us, it's making sure that he's okay all around right now.  Right now, yeah, that's for sure, man.  Kevin, thanks so much, man.  No problem, guys.  I'll see you later.  I'll come in and it'll be on a, on a different time.  Yeah, absolutely.  We look forward to that, Kevin.  No problem, guys.  Thank you, man.  Kevin Hart, everyone.  Remembering Patrice O'Neill, his greatest moments on ONA. 
[01:44:00]  Let me tell you, Patrice came out to LA, right?  Now, LA, LA comics are nothing like us here.  Yeah, we learned that a long time ago.  Listen, I live out there, you know, but I don't, I'm not on the circuit.  Out there, I can't, you know, I thank God that I'm, I'm able to tour and go out.  Cause I can't, I can't deal.  Like those guys, it's the most sensitive group of, they don't interact like this.  They don't fuck with each other.  What's the, what's the core group out there?  Cause we know the core group in New York.  You don't even know.  You don't even, I don't think it exists. 
[01:44:30]  There's no such thing.  There is no such place as a coffee shop.  There's no, there's no hangout.  There's no, like everybody's going on stage.  But in their mind, they're, it's their, every time they set up on stage is to make it.  Like this is the time.  Some producer's going to see me and I'm going to have my show.  That's the attitude out there.  Completely different.  Yeah.  Completely different.  So Patrice comes out, right?  First of all, let me tell you what Patrice does.  Patrice stays in my apartment, right?  I'm in a two bedroom apartment.  Uh, at the time I'm married, uh, so I'm like, you know, Patrice, you can stay with us.  It's no big deal. 
[01:45:00]  I put Patrice in the guest room, right?  So one day I come home, I'm going to give you guys a full fledged.  I don't give a shit.  Patrice, fuck him.  He can give me shit later.  So I come home, right?  It's quiet.  I don't, I don't hear anything in the room.  So I'm like, Patrice, you here?  Cause you know, the rental car was in the garage.  I don't know.  I guess not.  I go in the back.  The computer's on.  Patrice is in front of the computer.  I swear to God, I cannot make this up.  There's just some baby oil on the desk.  Like, you know, Patrice is big, so I can't see it from the computer. 
[01:45:30]  He's got the, he's got the headphones on attached to the computer, right?  So there's porn.  So Patrice is fucking like his, his, his, I guess he's got his dick out the boxing hole.  He didn't want to go with the full, he didn't want to go with the full.  Yeah, so I see the arm, I see the arm working, right?  So, so my wife, she's about to come in and I'm like, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.  I'm like, Patrice, you can't hear me cause he's got the fucking headphones on. 
[01:46:00]  So I smack, I smack the headphones off his head.  I say, I say, stupid, what, you beating your dick in the fucking office?  He's like, is your wife here?  So I'm like, hey man, just cut the shit off, Patrice.  So literally, listen, the most, the most humiliating move I've ever seen Patrice do, he wanted to finish.  He's like, just get out.  I said, you're not even going to fucking stop, man.  I said, you know, his back was so big, so I couldn't, I couldn't see anything, right?  So he's like, just get out, man. 
[01:46:30]  I'll be done in a second, literally.  I'll be done in a second, right?  Come in your fucking office.  So I leave.  Listen, this is what makes Patrice, Patrice.  Patrice comes out and liver masters.  He said, look, look guys, there's nothing to say to really make that situation better.  Uh, it is what it is.  Uh, it happened.  Uh, so let's just, let's just forget about it.  Move on.  Move on.  So that night, me and Patrice go out, right?  So we're out, we're ordered, we're going to the comedy club.  So I'm with Patrice.  Patrice is looking, he's just looking like, you know how Patrice does that. 
[01:47:00]  His nose and his bottom lip meet.  He's just, he's frowning his face up at these comics.  Like literally, he's just looking at them.  He's pointing the guys out.  He doesn't even know the guys.  He's like, oh God.  Like he's doing the thing.  Like, you know, for the listeners, I know you can't see me, but he's like pointing his  finger.  He's, he's giving them the look.  He's like, what are you, why are you?  So I'm looking and I'm like, Patrice, I say, you know, these guys, they're not, you 
[01:47:30]  know, they don't know our world.  They don't, they don't fuck around, you know, the same way we do.  He's like, I don't care.  He literally, he literally starts attacking.  It's like, it's like a man with a rifle, just picking people off.  He's like, look at, what are you, oh God, look at his appearance.  This guy.  He said, what you just talked about on stage made me go, oh, he's just, he's just destroyed. 
[01:48:00]  He's laying in these guys and these guys are getting mad.  Who the fuck are you, man?  Who do you think you are?  I'm coming right.  He's like, oh, your voice.  No matter what they say, his response is like, I'm the only one.  When I am on the floor, I'm cramping, I'm laughing so fucking hard.  He's like, oh, what is your notepad for?  What are you writing down?  What do you think?  Did you take notes of what you just did?  Let me see it.  Let me see your book.  The guy gives me the book, Patrice throws it. 
[01:48:30]  Throws his book.  It's like this guy's, it's his heart of his, this guy's hard work.  Like he's been sitting there jotting down bits all day.  Patrice chucked it.  Fucking guy is ruthless.  Hit a bottle of water somewhere across the room.  Patrice.  He's ruthless and hysterical when he fucking jumps on it.  He matches Patrice's funny anger.  Nobody.  Nobody at all.  I don't give a shit.  I don't care.  No, he will rip you to pieces and it will be hysterical.  And with that, Patrice O'Neal, everyone.  Patrice.  Oh, fuck.  Look, good morning.  We got Kevin Hart in studio. 
[01:49:00]  And he's telling us what's up.  What's going on?  I told him about when I caught you beating off in my fucking apartment.  You told him what?  When you did what?  When I caught you jerking off in my apartment.  Oh, that was a long time ago.  I didn't know.  Yeah.  It's still a funny fucking story.  I mean, that's before Kevin Hart stopped talking to me.  I wonder why he wouldn't want to talk to you.  We haven't talked to him about five years.  And then I think that was the last time we talked about Jerk Dog. 
[01:49:30]  No, we talked after that.  We talked after that.  I've seen you after that.  This is when Kev, this is these are stories before Kev stopped running the other way.  He didn't see me coming.  His career was taking off.  Now, I don't mind that.  Running the other way.  I don't mind that because his career is important.  But when I see you and I come walking towards you and he sees white people near him, he runs in front of white people.  That's what I'm talking about.  And I hear you guys cackling up a storm. 
[01:50:00]  Of course, five years ago, this is how I know Kev is famous because Jim Norton is giving him the famous laugh.  And Kev, five years ago, was just a little nigger.  He was a niggler.  I hear a story how famous Kev is.  This is how famous Kev is.  And I didn't know that because I don't have his number anymore.  And now tell me if this is true because this has me almost shaking in my ego boots. 
[01:50:30]  This fucker, there's a tour I hear coming up.  Is this public knowledge yet, Kev?  Go ahead, yeah, yeah, go ahead, go ahead.  Holy fuckball.  This is how big you're talking.  This is how famous this person is you're talking to now.  The thing is called, you know, Bernie Mac passed away.  So the Kings of Comedy can't really do the full tour anymore.  Right.  So I hear it's going to be a new Kings of Comedy tour. 
[01:51:00]  But there's no Bernie Mac.  So here's the thing.  There is no, like, fourth person to take Bernie Mac's place.  It is called Three Kings and a Heart Tour.  And Kev is the closer.  I didn't realize this shit.  I win the fuck and I win.  Here's what I want to know.  What put you over the top, Kev? 
[01:51:30]  Because we sit here and we cry wondering what the fuck put you to that level.  Was it Soul Plane?  You know the sad part, Trees?  Wasn't it so fucking so seriously funny?  I don't know.  I'm going to tell you what.  My friend became an old soul name.  I'm going to tell you what it was.  I think it was probably seriously funny.  But I'm going to tell you some real shit, though.  Here's the thing.  With the Three Kings and a Heart Tour.  And this is going to fuck you up.  You know, I talk about it.  I don't give a shit.  They said it. 
[01:52:00]  They wanted to do.  We were just supposed to do the one show, All Star Weekend.  Right?  That's what we were supposed to do.  And then after that, they were talking about taking it out.  So Steve Harvey was like, you know, I don't want to really do it because Bernie's not here.  It's hard for me to go on stage like that without Bernie.  Without Bernie, he said, you know, so he didn't really feel comfortable.  D.L. said he wanted to do it.  And I was like, well, I only wanted to do it for the All Star Weekend because it was that big.  So when they started talking about the other dates, before Steve even said it, I was like, I don't want to do the whole tour because I don't want to be a part of that particular brand. 
[01:52:30]  Like I said, that brand has already been done.  Shut the fuck up, nigga.  Let me tell you.  Let me tell you, this horse shit, he didn't want to do it because this motherfucker is the ticket seller.  Pretty much.  Yes.  So why join a less successful tour?  That was it.  I'm sorry. 
[01:53:00]  These are things I have to find out because after this horse shit phone call, we'll never talk again.  Patrice, first of all, Patrice, in my defense, in my defense, Patrice, my number, my fucking number hasn't changed, Patrice.  My fucking number hasn't changed.  Now, if you want to be honest, you disappeared, Patrice.  You did.  Do you believe this motherfucker?  He said his number didn't change.  If I go find his old number, it will not only go...  Patrice, don't fucking call me. 
[01:53:30]  That'd be on the message.  Why don't we do the challenge?  Patrice can call right now and Kevin can put his phone right next to the mic.  Call right now, Patrice.  Let's do the challenge right now.  I'm going to have to find Kevin's number.  Because this is how close me and little Kev used to be.  Hey, sorry, Mr. Hart, K-H.  It's K-Hart, man.  That's what they call me on the streets.  And by the way, as much as I'm trying to hate on Kev, that fucking seriously funny had me in tears. 
[01:54:00]  Kevin's a funny guy.  Thank you, man.  That shit was fucking funny.  Patrice, Patrice, hold on one second.  I'm dialing Kevin's old number right now.  And the phone's not ringing in front of us.  Wait, how old is it?  How old is it?  Wait, no.  In my defense, Jim definitely doesn't have the number.  Okay, let's see.  Which one of these is it?  Hey, Jim, don't call me.  Okay, listen.  Let me tell you.  Listen.  Let me show you how old the number is, Patrice.  Hold on, Patrice.  It's not real.  Patrice, Jim has an 888 number in his phone for me. 
[01:54:30]  That used to be my beeper when I first came to New York.  He's got 888-664.  He's got my beeper number.  That's how long.  That's good news that Norton was never really your friend.  I had the old cells.  Look, the time I jerked off at his house, man, those were the good old days.  He did catch me.  And I have to admit, I wasn't beating off at his house.  Because Kev at the time was the first one to have a Mac. 
[01:55:00]  And the porn just streamed.  I was lonely.  The porn was streaming.  And I got caught.  But, you know, this is a fun conversation.  Because I ain't talked to the nigga in a long time.  He caught me.  Patrice caught me fucking in my garage.  Me and my wife.  Listen, me and my wife was fucking in the car because Patrice was upstairs.  So Patrice came downstairs.  He said, he called me.  Like, he waited like 45 minutes and called me.  He said, uh, little dummy.  Little dummy. 
[01:55:30]  Were y'all just fucking in the car?  I said, yeah.  Well, that's no big deal because Kev had a bed in his house that he needed a ladder to climb up to.  He needed a small step stool to get in it.  And his wife used to fuck all the time.  And that's not the story.  That's all they do is because this nigga's zero.  And the other legendary thing about little Kev is he has a dick the size of a baby arm.  It's really depressing.  Oh, you see it?  No, but I've heard.  It depresses me.  And I don't even need to say the no homo thing. 
[01:56:00]  It's just like, you know, if, if, if, you know, girls are like, you know, hey, hi, how are you?  And the motherfucker might be like, hey, and it's like, hey, and he just goes, look, I got a big dick.  If I'm fucking a girl, I'll actually go, you should meet my friend, Kevin.  We could be hanging out with prostitutes and Kev could pull his dick out and ruin everything, even for the prostitutes. 
[01:56:30]  Because now they're like, well, if not, if everybody's dick ain't that.  Like it was a, it was a collective.  But it's a dick to have if you're going to be famous, nigga.  Hey, you're talking to your special guest.  I know I've been downgraded to I'll see you Friday, nigga.  Hey, Patrice.  I love Patrice, man.  I hear everybody having a fucking great time.  I can come down. 
[01:57:00]  I'm not doing nothing.  I'm retired.  Patrice.  We should have had Patrice in today.  You should have brought him fucking in.  I don't know why we didn't.  Patrice.  Hey, for real, don't be an asshole right now.  I'm just serious.  Jim's got your shit right.  My what, my number?  Yeah.  Don't call me, nigga.  No.  No, I'm calling.  Let's go.  Let's go eat today.  For real.  I ain't seeing you, man.  I think I'm not going to eat with you.  No.  See, this is what he says.  This is, listen.  He's difficult.  We all know that Patrice is very difficult.  You know how hard it is for him to turn down a meal?  We're all on the same page. 
[01:57:30]  Patrice is difficult.  Don't fucking be my friend on the radio, you cock fucker.  I want to Twitter a story of me jumping off to you.  Forgive me, motherfucker.  Don't call me today.  Make it three days so I know it ain't bullshit.  Three days.  You know what?  Three days from right now.  I'm not playing with you on Friday.  I'm calling you on Friday.  All right.  Hey, Patrice.  Why are you in town?  What are you, what show that had to have seven more shows added? 
[01:58:00]  No, dude.  Honestly, I'm in town.  I got to do 106 and Park and all that stuff while I'm here.  So I just noticed.  What is 106 and Park?  It's a show on TV show.  He was, Kev was a bad damn pickpocket.  He was a pickpocket yesterday.  Oh, there's a story there.  Really?  There's a story there after Patrice heads up.  Yeah.  A pickpocket.  A pickpocket. 
[01:58:30]  You know what?  I can't play.  I can't play like that.  No, no.  He's saying like, when did it happen?  That's what he says.  Yeah, Kev wasn't a fucking pickpocket.  I have to say that.  I'm joking around.  But little Kev, I swear to God, this is so shocking to me because I'm telling you, we were, you know, we all were close.  But, you know, life makes things go separately.  So, but the nigga, I wake up and I'm like, what the, this nigga is that fucking famous. 
[01:59:00]  I'm proud and jealous at the same time.  It'd be nice to hear you got stabbed or something.  See, that's what you were talking about.  That's how it is.  I said, that's what makes them, that's what makes them amazing.  Like, be honest.  And Patrice, you got to understand, you see since he's been on the air, everything that we said is true.  And he goes, this is the relation we have.  I haven't talked to Patrice in a while.  But when I talk to him, it's, it's that fast you pick back up.  Do I miss the big son of a bitch?  I'm not going to lie to you. 
[01:59:30]  I fucking do.  Why have I went different?  I got fucking kids now.  All right.  I got kids.  They know I'm out in fucking LA.  But Patrice is as.  You know what?  Touch your way about it.  I don't trust you around my baby's.  I don't trust you around my baby's.  Patrice, are you as disgusted as I am right now with, I missed the big lug?  He's like, I missed the big lug.  I'm glad Jimmy pointed that out.  He is masterfully, masterfully Hollywood.  I can't stay mad at him because he's funny and he's masterful at Hollywood. 
[02:00:00]  I wish I could take a page out of him, but the thing is, and the other thing I'm hoping  happens is that he gets old and he starts to be cute and he starts to look like Gary Coleman.  I go through a horrible, cute guy who can't jump on the floor and spit on his head no more.  I can't fucking wait to the downfall of his little prick. 
[02:00:30]  Hey, Patrice, listen, before you hang up, listen to what I told him about that had me  in tears.  Dude, do you remember when we were in LA and we went out and we was at the comedy clubs,  you were so disgusted with the circuit and the people and you started, you just started  bashing the comics, but you were doing it.  I have no bridges left in LA because, but see, I retired.  People don't know.  I retired, but I'm going to have to come back out.  I retired. 
[02:01:00]  But I think I'm going to just say fuck it and try to burn my last bridge because I've  been trying to really do the right thing, but they just don't let you.  I'm going to fucking start, I look for this guy, can't name his name.  I forgot this fucker's name, but it's one of these, these new unfunny, funny guys, like  these guys that, you know, I'm going to say this, but it's not supposed to be funny, but  it could be.  But if you don't laugh, it's so precious.  I love it.  Like, I'm done with these fucking people and I'm going to stop this shit before I go because 
[02:01:30]  I'm starting to get headaches too much and I know I'm out the way, I'm going to burn my  last fucking bridge and it's going to be spectacular.  I swear to fucking God.  That's awesome.  But at least, at least, I'm telling you, at fucking least, I got to talk to this nigga  again because I'm telling you, I'm very surprised because usually when white people are around,  Kev, don't talk to me, man.  I'm just telling you, he'll run away from me.  This is how little he thinks of you guys.  He realizes nobody in this room can help him. 
[02:02:00]  He knows that.  We have nothing to offer.  He's not stupid.  Hey, who started that?  Patrice, who started that Bill Burr beating?  Who started that Bill Burr bus beating?  Oh, you know what it was?  I'll tell you what it is.  Jim Norton is really, you got to be careful because another thing, Kev is like this too  and I think it's that Napoleon complex thing.  It's a really, Kev, this jerk off story started one day, we used to go downstairs back in the 
[02:02:30]  day at the cellar when guys would be performing, okay?  Oh, right.  And we would sit there and all sit in the front row and stare at him.  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  Oh, that's brutal.  Jesus.  We would go, but this is, he, this was the test.  I mean, we were brutal.  We used to have a hat court. 
[02:03:00]  We would put up somebody's hat on court.  They did it for me.  That bit you do, suck.  Hat court, I love it.  Hat court.  Really?  You put a bit on trial.  Dude, they would do it all the time.  It's fantastic.  I had a joke.  We went downstairs and we went downstairs and sat in front of him and he was, he was  flustered.  We was getting him.  And he, and I, he just caught me jerking off in his house.  This mother, this is how you know he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he fucking started imitating 
[02:03:30]  me jerking off, like jerking off at his house.  Damn sure did.  I pushed the button.  I didn't hear that nothing else.  He, he, he started cutting out of that, like, uh, uh, uh, uh, it was nasty how, it hurt  me.  I said he had to do what he had to do because he fucking had to get out of that situation  by any means necessary.  Now, here's, here's this fucker, Jim.  Bill was talking about something and, and Jim, oh, Jim said something and Bill said something  to Jim and, and Jim didn't like what Bill said to him. 
[02:04:00]  Like, he, he said it was, it was going to be embarrassing and Jim was going to get a  fucking beating for what happened.  And I forgot what it was, but Jim goes in front of me, Kev, Keith, uh, uh, and I think,  uh, it was another guy.  Bob Kelly.  Bobby was there for the bus beating.  It was, it was Kelly, but it was me and little Kev that was given the beating with the, with  the, but, but, but Norton goes, at least I'm not performing on a bus. 
[02:04:30]  That's right.  I do not remember that.  That's right.  Patricia, I'm 100% right.  Because Bill, Bill was going at it with you, Jim, and he hit you with something.  He hit you good.  And we were about to attack you.  You're right.  We were about to jump on your ass.  And Jimmy had his back pocket.  And Jimmy had his back pocket.  I think I remember that.  He threw a neutron bomb.  Everybody said, what?  I remember that.  We said, what?  I put it on a bus for tickets. 
[02:05:00]  It was.  Great, great, great deflection.  To this day, there was, there was three beatings, four beatings of, of all time.  And I'm telling you, Norton was a part of two of the, two of my biggest laughs in my life.  But this bus beating.  Bus beating is legendary.  Of Kev, because what, what, what happened is you feed Kev the, the important lines and  he would just make it, just, he would, he would take it to the next level.  And what was, what, what, what the whole thing was for an hour was, well, well, well, what, 
[02:05:30]  what happens if you start bombing?  And then where do you come from and where do you go?  We said, we said, we said, we said, we said, we said, we said, where did they bring you  come from?  We said, we said, Bill, Bill was behind the bus driver.  Bill Burr.  And he just takes a step out.  Oh.  He was just sitting in the front seat.  There's no way for him not to know that he was the comic.  Like, we was like, how do you sneak on stage, Bill? 
[02:06:00]  What's he saying?  My God.  We said, we started bombing.  What do you do is go, after, after one joke bombs, he just look out the window and go,  if you look to your list.  Oh, shit.  It was an all-timer, but, oh, man, good, good reminiscence.  And then is it, is it, it was, was it all like the public address system?  Like, hey, how about that?  I went to the container store with my girlfriend.  Norton, Norton, Norton, you don't remember, Norton just said, at least I'm not doing it. 
[02:06:30]  Jimmy knew his life was being threatened.  I swear to God, Patrice is not lying.  He's not lying.  Jim, you did.  I didn't remember that.  I certainly believe it.  Bill, no, wait a minute, but Bill looked at you. 
[02:07:00]  Why would you do that?  Like, how could you do that?  Why?  I had all things to do.  I remember, I remember when they talking about the, uh, the court, like when he's talking  about, you know, we put your jokes on display.  They came downstairs.  It's some true shit.  They, they did this to me a couple of times.  Like, you know, I was the, I was like, if it were a fraternity, I was the guy that was  just trying to get in.  They, they would do like the, the most brutalist shit to me.  Right.  So, you know, I'm at the cellar, I'm at the cellar.  And at the time I've been doing the spots for a while.  My spots were never great spots.  I'm, you know, one 30 in the morning. 
[02:07:30]  I'm, I'm dead ass, but we're all there.  We're giving each other shit.  They come sit in the front row.  I remember Patrice and Keith on my mom, this shit.  When I say like it, it's, it, I was so mad, but you can't, you can't show that side.  Like every joke I said, they would, they would go, ah, right on the punchline, right on the  punchline.  But the audience, the audience didn't know, like, you know, it's only a good 20 people  in there. 
[02:08:00]  So the audience had no idea who they were.  Every fucking joke I did.  Like Keith, I remember hearing Keith's voice was simply like, ah, no, come on.  Like, listen, it was so, but I can't stop.  Like the cameras are on.  No, no.  So I can't look like I'm not taking this shit serious.  So I'm like trying to, trying to trudge through.  And then you ever see the guy, I remember it was a midget joke.  I had the joke about a cross-eyed midget.  Oh my God.  I said, he was robbing me.  Can I just say one thing without, I hope one day that I have a day in this, in this, 
[02:08:30]  in this, in this goddamn business, but I will say to not sound like uncle Patrice, it, this  is the one thing I want you to take to your Hollywood friends.  Kev, is that they owe us, me, Kev, me, Keith, Norton, they owe us Kev and Hart, meaning  we would have, they would have never heard the name Kev and Hart if we didn't make him  change it from Kev, the little bastard. 
[02:09:00]  Little Kev the bastard.  Little Kev the bastard.  My name is Little Kev the bastard.  Tell him.  So think, I want all white people to think.  Dude, I wish, I wish there was a part of me, I wish I could deny half of this shit.  I wish I could be like, fuck you, Patrice, you son of a bitch, you don't know shit.  I wish I could.  Listen, my name was Little Kev the bastard.  I was the only person in the New York circuit that was coming up with music.  Listen, like, you know, like at the cellar, they announce you, the crowd just claps.  Keep in mind, these crowds are intimate for your listeners. 
[02:09:30]  These are, these are audiences of 25, 50, you know, maybe, maybe 70 on the weekend.  You know, it's just applause.  I was the only person that came up to, uh, uh, it's your birthday by Luke.  Uh, like the speakers, the speakers, they can't handle music.  The speakers would never prepare for music at all.  They're rattling.  Keith, Keith saw the potential.  We, we said, Keith, take this little Philly mess and go back to Philly with him. 
[02:10:00]  And Keith fucking, Keith said, no, this motherfucker, 20, and, and, and he fucking, Kevin, you know.  He did not see potential.  Keith wanted to be a mentor once in his career, and he figured he could bully little Kev.  He wanted to be a mentor, because Kev probably for a while listened to Keith, like, really?  You think I should do that?  Yeah, you should do that.  And Keith had some respect from somebody.  You know what Keith is in the business?  Keith is like an old grandfather who has a lot of children, and he's waiting for one to just let him stay in his house. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, I told him, I already told Keith I'm not coming back for him.  I've told him several times.  I said, I like you where you are.  I said, I want you to keep driving that fucked up Ford Focus.  I said, I hope you, I hope they get to, I said, I hope the IRS, I said, I hope the IRS, I said, I hope the IRS, I told him, I said, hey, I said, I hope the IRS doesn't let you write your toll charges off.  I said, I said, that's Keith's biggest, that's his biggest receipt thing for the IRS, and I said, I hope they don't accept him. 
[02:11:00]  I like you where you are, but I got to give him.  Old laughs, man.  Hey, Opie, these are, I'm telling you, these are old laughs, nigga.  I'm fucking loving it today, bro.  Oh, hell yeah.  Hey, Patrice, by the way, Jimmy, Jimmy's heading out to L.A. tomorrow.  You want to come in?  Tomorrow?  Shit, you niggas is making me commit this shit on the radio.  All right, I'll be here.  Well, I know, that's why I do it this way, put you on the spot.  No, we'd love to have you in tomorrow.  Jimmy's flying out today, right?  I want to stay mad at Kev.  I want to stay mad at this nigga for not talking to me for five years. 
[02:11:30]  We should have had you in today.  I wish he was in today.  I didn't know the history between all you guys.  Yeah, yeah, I just didn't think of it.  Yeah, man, Kev is Kev, but he was the smart one.  He fucking left.  That motherfucker, it was one, he got one good joke and got a plane and got the fuck out of here.  I've been wasting around here for 19 years.  Just waiting for your plane.  It hit me.  Oh, yeah, I'm not doing nothing tomorrow. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, yeah, we just made you look bad.  I'm sorry.  I'm calling the sneakers.  Do you like to come in?  Sure.  Patricia should have said, I got to check my schedule.  Yeah.  I know you.  You could have lied.  I can't.  I got a call back.  Yeah.  You could have said something.  I don't know.  I don't hang in the back fucking warm room at the tech stadium just sitting in pictures of fucking 45-year-old Ralph Macchio.  I was fucking home crying.  I was like fucking pretending. 
[02:12:30]  This kid Troy calls me.  He goes, hey, Patrice, this is Troy from LA.  What do you want?  I'm busy.  Yeah, Kevin Hart's on the phone.  I don't know.  Yeah, put me on.  I'm like, I ain't doing shit.  What the fuck am I doing?  Anyway, Kev, man, congratulations, brother, because I haven't talked to you in a while.  Thank you, Trace.  Hey, Friday.  You said I got three days.  I got three fucking days.  I'm going to call you in three days.  I'm not bullshitting.  I'll take my hug up.  We continue to celebrate the life of Patrice O'Neal.  God damn.  With more of his greatest moments on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:13:00]  Next.  We continue with more of our tribute to Patrice O'Neal.  Hello, people.  This is Mars, ONA's engineer.  I just wanted to say that I'll miss you, Patrice O'Neal.  He was the one individual that always gave me much love when he came to the studio.  He would always move me with his smile and his huge, genuine bro hug, dude hug, or homie hug, whatever you want to call it.  My fondest memory of Patrice is when the boys convinced him to stay for the Chris Cornell interview as he explained that he had nothing to add because he knew nothing of Soundgarden or Chris Cornell or something like that. 
[02:13:30]  After about 10 minutes of the interview, Patrice turns around dramatically to face me and only me.  And he gives me that special Patrice O'Neal, what the fuck look.  As if saying, I said I have nothing to add and I want to go home.  He was always real and will let you know the shit's real. 
[02:14:00]  I'll miss you, Patrice.  Rest in peace.  Remembering Patrice O'Neal.  His greatest moments on ONA.  We were just talking about...  Snakes on a plane.  Snakes on a plane.  What's that hissing?  It's a snake on a plane.  Snakes on a plane.  We were saying he should just substitute all of his Pulp Fiction lines and just put them in the movie.  Mmm.  Seems like that's what happened.  That's some tasty oatmeal.  Snake? 
[02:14:30]  You read the Bible, snake?  This is some repugnant mother-evident...  Stop that hissing!  What are we going to do about the snake?  How are they going to pull this off like you guys are saying during the break?  How is this movie going to be pulled off?  I just want to know.  It's got so much hype and everyone's like goofing on it before it comes out and talking about it.  I've been hearing about snakes on a plane since, what, like Thanksgiving?  Oh man, it's been months.  It's been a really long time.  They've been hyping this movie for almost a year. 
[02:15:00]  Nine months.  Finally, as per E-Rock, they had to rewrite the film a lot because during, I guess, some  of the quick screenings they've given people, they didn't like the fact that Sam Jackson  didn't use the M-R-E-F-er enough, which is one of his, you know, everyone loves hearing  him use that phrase.  He's still in the Jedi mode.  It wasn't cursing enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's still in his...  Ace Windu.  The Force.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, my children.  Ace Windu, whatever the hell his name was.  But they, yeah, they wanted more, him cursing more and more snakes, I guess. 
[02:15:30]  There weren't enough, not enough snakes on the plane.  You need a lot of snakes on the plane.  It's just one snake.  That sucks.  And how did he get on the plane with the snakes?  I don't know.  But I'm on a plane.  But I'm on a plane full of snakes.  They must not be liquid.  Snakes.  Snakes ain't liquid.  People are saying the movie's good, man. 
[02:16:00]  Rotten Tomatoes dot com is giving it 77% good rating.  What does that mean?  Rotten Tomatoes is the best website for movie reviews because they take all the reviews  from all the papers all over America and then they give you a nice average.  Because your local guy might just be...  Rotten Tomatoes on the mother f***ing plane!  Because your local movie reviewer could just be a douche.  Yeah.  You know, so you get the balance of the entire country and then you could figure out a little  better if the movie's going to be all right.  I think they must have geniously pimped because it's almost like when somebody attacks you, 
[02:16:30]  you attack yourself to give it less fire.  Yeah.  I think they're making this movie purposely trying to say, oh, this is goofy and it's awful.  And they're like, okay, we're going to review it as a goofy, awful movie.  And for a goofy, awful movie, this is fantastic.  Did you ever see a sign on the plane that said Live Snake Storage Jewels?  Hey, uh...  Whoopi's on the plane! 
[02:17:00]  I thought it was snakes, but it was a hair!  Whoopi's motherf***ing hair is on a plane!  I thought we had snakes on a plane!  It's scaring the passengers!  It's just Whoopi's hair!  It's Whoopi's dreadlocks on a motherf***ing plane!  Damn, now we don't have a movie!  Hey, that snake bitch, are you okay?  Nah, I'm...  Nah, man.  I'm far from...  I'm pretty f***ing far from okay.  Wake up, Whoopi! 
[02:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  Let me get some hard pipe-hitting s*** over here.  Work on Whoopi Goldberg.  With a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.  They're going to get medieval on your ass.  Negro, that's all you had to say!  Yeah, Marsalis, there's snakes on a plane! 
[02:18:00]  Snakes on a motherf***ing plane.  What are they going to think up next in Hollywood?  Snakes on a...  Hey, Kyle in New York.  I love it.  Kyle?  Hey, man.  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead.  You saw snakes on a plane last night, right?  Yes, it was the best movie of the summer.  Wow, wow.  Look, the summer didn't have a lot to choose from.  How about birds in a car?  There's a bird! 
[02:18:30]  Screw bird, how about a bee in your car?  That's frightening.  There's a bee in the car!  I got to get these pack heats to the pack heat asylums for pack heats!  Without getting eaten by the snakes!  Otters in a canoe!  Oh, damn.  Otters in a canoe!  Holy moly!  There's otters!  Otters in a canoe!  Otters in a canoe!  Oh, holy moly! 
[02:19:00]  Otters in a canoe!  Otters in a canoe!  Oh, damn!  Otters in a canoe!  They got big teeth!  We hit him with an oar, dummy!  Oh, my God!  I can't get past bees in a car, though.  Bees in a car!  That's frightening, man.  When you're driving and you just hear...  You look, I'll be making a fly.  Please be a fly.  It's a bee!  No!  You're still just weaving all over the road.  Damn, bee in a car!  Bee in a car! 
[02:19:30]  Bee in a car!  I ain't get a car stung by no mother...  bee in no mother...  car!  This summer.  Bees in a car.  Well, that's how Hollywood works, so you know these are coming.  If there's any success with snakes on a plane...  They'll just throw something in some form of transportation.  Fish in the post office!  I'm driving mad, son!  And there's fish in the post office! 
[02:20:00]  Sharks!  Sharks in the post office!  I gotta mail a mother...  letter!  And there's mother...  fish in the mother...  post office!  Hey, shark!  Lick this stamp!  If you're gonna kill me, let me mail my bills!  Hey, Mr. Torrance is calling out Patrice O'Neal from the Overlook, of course.  Why do parakeets need to go to an asylum?  I don't know!  Are these evil parakeets? 
[02:20:30]  They're evil parakeets, man!  Evil!  Thank you for helping me through the bus!  Friendly parakeets, they're crazy!  Man, this is Hollywood, man!  Hiss again!  Come on, hiss again!  I dare ya!  I double dare ya, mother effer!  It's one more goddamn time!  Rob from Jacksonville!  It's one more time!  I dare ya!  I double dare ya!  Here we go, here we go!  Let's go to Mike in Boston!

[02:21:30]  How am I supposed to make a deposit with a possum in the mother f***ing bank?  I mean, f*** gotta eat!  And they ain't even trying to pretend to be asleep!  What kind of possum are these?  They ain't playing possum!  Stay up!  Bring them to the possum asylum!  Oh my god! 
[02:22:00]  Possum in the bank!  And they not!  And these possums ain't sleeping!  Wallabies at the DMV!  Kevin from Connecticut!  Possums in a bank!  Oh!  Oh no!  Gerbils at the liquor store!  Oh no!  Mother f***!  I ain't gonna get some liquor!  Gerbils in the liquor store! 
[02:22:30]  How do you know at the end it's gonna be...  What do you think the saying's gonna be at the end?  Like, you know, the ending of the snake saying...  Oh god!  Hasta la vista, snakes!  Yeah, there's gotta be that one line...  That one douche line...  Like, uh...  Yeah, open and say, ah...  Right...  Or smile, you son of a bitch...  From Jaws...

But very good...  What do they call mongoose on a plane?  Don't know...  Never seen no mongoose...  There's goldfish in the toilet!  God damn!  Swimming around in us!  Goldfish in the toilet! 
[02:24:00]  Messing up my number two!  Hey, uh...  Let's go to Brian in Miami...  Brian!  How you doing?  You guys got to replay the, uh...  Big Cove interview of Samuel L. Jackson!  Oh, yeah, that's...  Oh, do we have that?  That thrill a minute!  Hey, we got an exclusive interview with, uh...  Samuel L. Jackson for the O.P. and Anthony Show!  Only the best for our listeners!  We'll find that!  Thank you, sir!  Wow!  This movie will make $700!  Oh!  Tarantula's on the escalator! 
[02:24:30]  There's mother...  Tarantula's on the mother...  Escalator!  All stranded on the escalator!  And they got to keep walking!  Keep walking!  It's going up and they got to walk down!

They just get ugly.  They just get ugly.  Of course they do.  These horrific...  What are they, all from Philly?  Must be all lit up from Philadelphia.  Like Charlie's...

It's quick.  This is Big Kev.  I'm here with Sam Jackson.  Talking about snakes on a plane.  Okay.  Go ahead, sir.  What do you want me to say about it?  Tell me everything about it.  Uh, jeez. 
[02:27:30]  It's, uh...  It's kind of what it sounds like, you know?  It's a bunch of poisonous snakes on a plane full of passengers.  Us trying to survive.  The snakes kind of doing what snakes do.  Running around, killing people.  We got great snakes.  We got great victims.  And we got a really, you know, thrill ride for you if you come and see this thing.  Very good.  That's, uh, Sam Jackson talking about snakes on a plane.  That's our interview!  That's it.  That's our exclusive interview with Sam Jackson. 
[02:28:00]  That's it.  There's lobsters in the pool!  There's a mother**** muskrat in a sidecar!  There's charisma on Big Kev!  So, what is that charisma doing on Kev?  Oh my god.  The top of this water bottle has more...  Oh, I know.  Hey, Sam.  How are you?  Uh, gotta go.  Snakes on a Plane.  What's that about?  It's about snakes on a plane, ass. 
[02:28:30]  Right.  What the hell you think it's about?  It's a movie.  It's a war movie, idiot.  Yeah.  I know war movies.  There's a...  War movies are always named.  Porkchop Hill, but in this case, what's Porkchop Hill about?  It's about a porkchop on a hill!  We gotta get away from this porkchop!  It's a porkchop sitting on a hill!  And hamburger!  Hamburger!  Let's go to Carrie. 
[02:29:00]  Carrie?  Carrie, what's up?  We lose Carrie?  Hello?  You?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Not much.  Hi.  What do you got to say for yourself, ma'am?  What's up?  Wow, you see...  Anyone else see the energy just flying out the window?  Hello?  Wow.  She punched out.  I guess we gotta take a break now. 
[02:29:30]  That was...  She ruined it.  She ruined it for everybody.  As women do.  There's a woman in the bed!  She ruined it!  We all gonna die!  A mother f***ing woman in the mother f***ing bed!  Remembering Patrice O'Neal.  His greatest moments on ONA.  Let's listen to this Asian broad.  Big face.  Yeah, let's hear it.  I want to hear how the Asian broad figured out she could make an extra five bucks.  Jesus, enough already.  She lost a client for five dollars. 
[02:30:00]  They don't understand.  What a clunt!  What a crunt!  Would you go clunt or crunt?  Let's go clunt.  I like clunt.  What a clunt!  Right, I like clunt.  You're a clunt!  A crunt!  Alright, I gotta hear it.  That's not decrimination.  That's not about decrimination.  Really?  And if we said clean-a-nation, we'd be fired.  That's not about decrimination.  If we were on regular radio and said it's not about the clean-e-ation or whatever, we'd  be fired.  What the f***? 
[02:30:30]  They're imitating this.  These inhumanists.  They really are.  The lads of f***ing...  You'd be dead right in front of them.  They have nothing to give.  Well, let's see why they charge chair breaker a little more money.  Let's see what Fatso did, first of all.  Don't let Fatso off the hook yet.  Let's see what she did.  That's not decrimination.  That's not about decrimination.  The manager tells me it's about the salon chairs that cannot hold more than 200 pounds,  or it could lead to costly repairs. 
[02:31:00]  $2,500.  You think that's not fair when we take $2,400 and we have to pay for $2,500?  Is that fair?  No.  The manager did refund Fondville the $5 overcharge and told her to take her business elsewhere.  I say, Michelle, sorry.  Next time I cannot take you.  It was a matter of fact, you know, attitude.  And I just couldn't believe another human being was talking to another human in that man.  The word has to get out there.  These people are discriminating against us because of our weight. 
[02:31:30]  I mean, come on.  We're in America.  You can't do that.  Well, you can.  Well, I have no sympathy for either one of them.  Exactly.  The decrimination makes me sick to my stomach.  And you got to be fair.  This fat bitch could have broke her $2,500 to launch it.  Yeah.  Because I've priced them.  Barber chairs cost fucking $3,500.  You fat bitch.  When they click you up and down in that barber chair, you know, every click.  She only charged you a $5 could have broke my chair fee. 
[02:32:00]  You know what?  Shut the fuck up.  She's collecting a lot of $5.  Shut the fuck up.  $5 you could break my chair fees, though.  They're both of these motherfuckers.  Yeah, they're both fucking despicable.  Oh, that's a reneal.  It's not decrimination.  That's $2,500.  But why can't you?  Here's what they're so ready to fucking be at war, these third world people.  Yeah.  They don't know how to go look.  This is going to suck what I'm about to say.  Yeah, yeah.  Please.  You can't.  You're too much weight. 
[02:32:30]  Can I take it?  Too much weight for the chair.  Come back here.  Come back here a minute.  I have to tell you something.  Yes.  In common.  Not in front of everybody.  You're too fat.  You're too fat.  Not decrimination.  $5 for break a seat.  Decrimination.  Oh.  But you know what, though?  Even if she was nice, you know that woman would have won.  Ah, yeah.  She's gone.  Fuck again.  And then again, the Asians have something.  Oh, she would have had this fucking...  Mm-hmm.  They would have started to share with us some music, and then she just would have went off  with this bitch.  Patrice, can you humor me about your Asian joint again? 
[02:33:00]  I love it every fucking time.  Listen, all of them.  You go there all year after year, three, four days a week.  I went to my favorite Chinese restaurant yesterday.  They treat me...  Like they've seen you for the first time.  It was as if I've never been there.  It was...  I figured I had earned like some VIP treatment.  I went there for lunch, which I usually don't go.  Yeah.  And that motherfucker said, wait!  I said, nigga, I'm the only motherfucker in here when it's empty, you cocksucker. 
[02:33:30]  I be thinking I'm the only one keeping it open.  And they fucking treat me like dog shit.  I'm here on a Tuesday afternoon, you motherfucker.  And I said, I know I should be able to squeeze by these white people coming from work.  He told me to eat their...  They love white people, too.  And they love...  They truly love white people.  There's nothing I could ever do that's going to up me.  But the fucking dry cleaner guy, he's starting to learn, though. 
[02:34:00]  Because I stopped talking to him.  And he goes, hello, O'Neal.  He won't call me...  Hello, O'Neal.  Hello, O'Neal.  Hiya.  Here's what he extends me now.  I'll tell you what he does now.  I just drop my clothes off.  And this is why I won't leave him, though.  No one does a better job than Chinese people at what they do.  They're just enormously talented at fucking doing what they do.  They're machines.  Increases shit.  There was a Russian lady I took my shit to.  She talked a lot, and there were stains on my clothes. 
[02:34:30]  Period.  This guy, he won't give me a free...  He won't not...  If the bill is $39.19, this motherfucker...  That's the $19.  $19.  I told you about my fucking guy that comes and cleans my fish tank.  Oh, yeah.  I love him.  This motherfucker goes like this, okay?  Yeah, he bought me something, a little $4 temperature thermometer for my tank.  Right, right, yeah.  This motherfucker goes, well, you know, it costs $4, but you know, I get this nigga $300 a month to clean my fucking face. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It costs a lot of money to keep these fucking fish alive.  So he's like, well, and I spent $4, I didn't charge you in four and a half.  I forgot to charge...  Yeah, they got pointed out on top of it.  But did you go, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.  I said, you fucking asshole.  So I said, I said, sweet.  I told my girl, go upstairs and look at the drawer.  Give me, give me 16 quarters.  Oh, shit. 
[02:35:30]  16, she brought him down.  She put, he cupped his hand.  Oh, wow.  He cupped his hand.  Instead of going, don't worry about it.  And took 16 quarters.  Dirty, greasy quarters.  Without even, he took all the, it was beyond sarcasm.  It wasn't sarcasm.  Right.  It was to show, what a fucking, don't be this cheap.  There's loyalty involved.  Don't take it.  There's loyalty involved.  Wait a minute.  You mean the guy that probably came over on a slave ship and his sister's a hooker somewhere? 
[02:36:00]  Jerking guys off to pay her debts?  Wanted the money he spent?  He's cleaning your fucking fish tank in your fucking condo?  You tell dick jokes for a living?  The nerve of that guy to want his money.  Fuck you.  But to Patrice's point, I'm sure you tip the guy every fucking week, too.  Dude, I never, if the bill is $2.80, he's not getting, if it's $2.80 and $10, I'm not, it's embarrassing to just.  Yeah, change.  It's embarrassing to do that. 
[02:36:30]  But there's something in him.  And I'm telling you, my laundry person, everybody's Asian.  They do a fantastic job.  But the people skills, I don't know what it is.  It has to be a mental thing because they don't understand I'll never come back here again.  And they don't understand I don't speak English.  That's the thing.  In Miami, I couldn't, and it was for Mexican reasons, but I couldn't order any food to be delivered because people answer the phone. 
[02:37:00]  And you go, can I?  Do you deliver?  I'm like, do you understand how much money you're fucking losing?  Like, they should do that show.  I watch the show, Undercover Boss.  I think it's beautiful.  Yeah.  They should have this with people that, oh, it's like, is this acceptable?  These screams?  Can you deliver me? 
[02:37:30]  And you go, hi, I'm, do you deliver?  And you go out of your way.  And this is what I'm getting tired of, too.  They treat niggas like shit.  I go out of my way to be fucking nice because I know they all hate niggas.  Yeah.  I know they all do.  And they don't understand sarcasm and everything.  So white people understand sarcasm.  At least.  Do we?  At least.  At least.  So you get when a niggas like, really?  But they don't get when a niggas like, really?  They're sitting there. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  What is your problem?  I'm like, are you charging?  Are you charging?  Apple Store.  Asian guy.  They got this thing, the magic pad now.  They kind of, they took off the laptop thing and it just now, it's just by itself.  So now you can do a laptop.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like a little metal thing.  Yeah, they took the metal thing out and they sell it separate.  You have to upgrade to the 10.6 leopard, snow leopard, to use it. 
[02:38:30]  I didn't know that.  I bring it to the Chinese guy.  He goes, they say upgrade.  I say what?  Upgrade.  Upgrade?  What do you mean the fuck?  How much?  How much?  I said, do you think this is fair?  This piece of shit held the box and ran his fingers across where it said 10.6.  I go, I just bought this computer.  I have a 10.5, you motherfucker. 
[02:39:00]  And he slid his finger to, he's sarcastic to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He doesn't even speak English.  Isn't it a free upgrade, though?  You just upgrade?  No!  10.6 costs fucking $30 for one computer, $50 for five.  Wait, you can't just go online up the software upgrades?  You gotta pay for 10.5 to 10.6.  You gotta pay.  The only thing you don't have to pay for is you go 10.6, and then the point after the  six, you know, it's 10.6. 
[02:39:30]  Three, 10.6.  Right, oh, I got it.  You get, as long as it's 10.6, you can always upgrade.  But then you're gonna have to buy 10.7 to use the fucking mouse.  And an Asian guy treats you like dog shit.  Man!  Fuck!  Asians are just...  Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.  Upgrade, upgrade.  He only charges...  Fuck! 
[02:40:00]  Wow.  And like you said, if anybody goes, decrimination, you get fired for being a fucking racist.  Yeah.  What did that person just say?  I'm telling you, Jews get a bad, cheap rep.  But I'm telling you, dude, there's no way Jews are cheaper than fucking Asians.  Cheap rep.  Penny, I mean, to the dime.  If I ever own things, if I ever own businesses, Asians, they are fucking...  Trust me.  Trust me. 
[02:40:30]  I'm hiring them.  Yeah.  Because they will die over your cigarettes.  A nigga will be robbing the store, and he will not let the...  Nigga, your last name is not Eleven.  Let the cigarette...  They have insurance for that, you fucking dipshit.  Let them steal them.  And if I'm short 99...  If it's 98 cent and I give you 97, let me go for the penny.  Yeah.  I swear to God, I'll bring the two cents back to you tomorrow.  Especially if you see me... 
[02:41:00]  You're every day.  Every day.  You're a penny short.  You're a penny short.  Press your face against the bulletproof glass.  It's me.  I know your name.  Your name is Darren.  Your name is Darren Patak.  I know you, nigga.  What are you doing?  Loyalty, you motherfuckers.  Loyalty.  Yeah.  I love this every fucking time. 
[02:41:30]  Horrible, man.  Every fucking time.  Because we all have our restaurants we go to all the time.  And if they do the right thing, they take care of you every once in a while.  This sushi lady.  What the fuck, man?  I went to this one sushi place.  I went to fucking get a bike for everybody.  You know what I'm saying?  Family bike days.  Yeah, nice.  Went in there and get the sushi place.  This lady's treat.  She can't get past.  Nigga.  Really?  She won't get past it.  And she's treating me like shit.  I'm sarcastic, right? 
[02:42:00]  I'm really getting tired of this.  People handing you.  This is what they do.  Hand you your credit card slip.  And say, sign here.  Oh, no.  What do you think?  I'm trying to escape, bitch.  You were going to leave without signing.  You're saying here.  Yeah.  You're there every Tuesday, Thursday.  $62 on dead fish.  You clung. 
[02:42:30]  Sign here.  Yeah.  I signed it.  And I said, oh, wait.  I came back.  And I said, give me that slip.  I've made two, six wiggly lines where the tip should be.  And made sure that she knew I'm never coming back and no fucking tip.  Damn.  And this is going to make the next nigga that come in here get treated even worse.  Right.  But please take responsibility for the fact that I'm a fucking great tipper.  Nothing less than 20.  Sometimes it hurts.  I don't want to tip.  I don't want to pay 120. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  But I do.  Fucking bitch.  Fuck.  They treat niggas like shit.  Wow.  And white people, especially all white women, treat anybody in the service industry like garbage.  Yeah.  There's certain things that, look, when you go out to certain places where you should get,  some races you get treated, you should get treated better in some situations. 
[02:43:30]  At a restaurant, white people probably should get treated better as a whole.  But at a sneaker store, when I walk into the footlocker or some black girl is buying a pair of red shoes to match her earrings or her fucking hat,  you should push an annoying white person who's really trying to find out what the gel is for in the fucking ASICs  for some nigga that's getting ready to just buy the new Jordans because they out.  You know what I'm saying?  Treat me better at the sneaker store. 
[02:44:00]  Treat you better at the fucking, you feel me?  Bank.  Treat you better at the bank.  Most likely you got a better account than the average nigga, but there's some things we do that we should just get treated.  Chinese food?  How the fuck can the bulletproof Chinese place treat me like shit?  The bulletproof Chinese place?  Just because they need to be a bulletproof Chinese place?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But God bless them, especially when niggas don't, there's nowhere where white people shop where they say no credit cards, where it's cash only. 
[02:44:30]  Nowhere.  No fucking where.  You go places niggas put up with that stupid shit, cash only.  Really?  This is illegal.  There's places with no credit cards?  Dude, cash fucking only.  And then some that tell you you can't.  It's illegal to say there's an amount that you're not being able to charge.  There's no limit.  I actually ate at an Italian joint over the weekend, cash only.  Really?  That's what that's about, right?  Yeah, occasionally food restaurants.  You're right.  Peter Luger's is cash only. 
[02:45:00]  Peter Luger's is cash only.  Steak joint.  How the fuck can they get away with that shit?  They don't want to pay a percentage to the credit card company.  That's right.  Cash only.  They're allowed to do that.  So they can just turn down that shit.  Because a lot of them don't want to pay a percentage.  Because you've got to pay a little bit of 3% or whatever.  A lot of them won't take Amex because they charge a higher percentage.  I got an Italian joint.  I got an Italian joint.  I got an Italian joint.  Cash only.  Nobody carries money.  Especially Peter Luger's.  The end of the bill is $300.  Yeah, exactly.  Honestly, this Italian joint, the sauce is amazing.  I avoid the place because of the cash only and only go there once in a while.  But he don't care because I think there's something else going on. 
[02:45:30]  Damn, the food is delicious.  Dude, I carry so much cash.  I don't care.  Oh, Jimmy.  Just willy-nilly.  Never say that.  Just falling out of your pockets as you walk.  Throw hundreds.  $200 meals.  Sometimes you fucking, you know, sometimes you cash.  Sometimes meals be $100 and some odd.  Yeah, yeah.  Cash only.  That's a little rough, right?  I fucking love Chinese food.  And you end up, you know, you pay $100 and something.  And to be honest, the one that I go to, where I go, only go there because they somewhat treat me fucking decent. 
[02:46:00]  Hey, we got a Chinese broad on the line.  What, is she mad?  No.  Not at all.  Thank God.  Chinese, Renee?  It's Korean.  All right, Korean.  What is that, better?  Don Rickles' line.  Chinese or Japanese.  What is that, better?  And why won't you fuck niggas?  That's another thing.  All right, let's start with what she's got first, then we'll move on.  Go ahead, Renee.  All right, I just wanted to comment on the conversation y'all are having. 
[02:46:30]  I am treated like shit by Asian people.  I was adopted when I was like one year old from Korea, raised by white people, all that.  And I swear to God, they can tell.  I went to go get my nails done last week, made an appointment for 3.30, got there, weren't ready, waited for a half an hour.  A white girl comes walking in, and they took the white bitch before they took me.  I've been sitting there for a half an hour.  They love white people.  They do.  And I, like when I made the appointment on the phone, they were nice as hell to me. 
[02:47:00]  I come in there, they barely say like anything to me, piss me off.  But you know what?  Over there, they treat each other like shit.  Like sweatshops, and they have little kids taking out like lithium batteries and chewing them.  Like, they're just, I'm not humane.  Why would they make them chew them?  Battery gum.  Because they're trying to save that, I think there's a little piece of gold inside any TV set that keeps... 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, yeah, so they have them like picking off the little pieces of gold.  Battery gum.  Kids with their fucking brains on the outside.  What was the other question for Renee?  Well, she's adopted, so it doesn't...  Oh, okay.  She's adopted.  Hey, Renee, you should see Patrice.  He's going to be in the area.  D.C. Improv.  Yeah.  Over the weekend, coming up.  Oh, like, Mitch Fatal the other weekend.  Yeah, we're thinking about going down there, so...  Don't even think about it.  Patrice rules.  Especially Washington.  It's his favorite place.  I'm so racist against adopted Asians, too, I'm going to tell you. 
[02:48:00]  You would never give a black man a chance, would you?  That's not true at all.  Oh.  A lot of laughing in that.  Yeah.  You see how beautiful Asian and black babies are, though?  They're gorgeous.  Yeah, you can think about it.  They've got a nice combo going on, right?  Just think about it.  Tomorrow, Lisa, then she's hot.  Put a little...  You mix the Koreans with a little something else, and wow, what comes out is nice.  Except for having a shit beat out of you in school. 
[02:48:30]  That's a little bit.  Take a Korean girl and mix her with anything, and you're going to have a nice-looking baby.  She's laughing at her.  Oh, man, is that a miserable woman.  Miserable.  That's communism, though, man.  That's one thing about America.  That picture smells like communism.  Put in the market on fucking laughter and smiles.  Yeah.  These fucking people...  I'm sorry, sweetie.  Third world women are miserable, which means their men are fucking horrible today. 
[02:49:00]  Look at them.  Look at her.  You think she's ever laughed?  She's not getting...  She's never had a big cock or seen one.  She's being fucked by a horrible small dick with fucking that horrible fish breath, her  rotten husband with his straight pubes.  She gets a horrible fuck every night.  With this blurred-out dick that...  In that little boxy one-room house.  With this most saying dick that she can't even really see.  Now, Patrice, going back to the restaurant, and he's saying, you know, he worked in the 
[02:49:30]  industry, and he says blacks are the worst tippers.  I'm going to say this.  Listen.  But if you're going to the same joint over and over again, that takes it out of the equation.  Thank you so much, but...  They have to be acknowledging, you know, what kind of tip you're looking after a while,  right?  You've got to understand tipping at what Jimmy calls having a gentleman's meal, okay?  Tipping at a place with a gentleman's meal.  Some people, right, they go there, I'm tipping is a...  What's a gentleman's meal?  Like a steak joint or something?  Like not McDonald's.  Well, you know it's nice.  It's a nice meal.  Gentleman's atmosphere. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, it's a gentleman's meal, okay?  What about a shitty Chinese restaurant?  A shitty...  Now, a shitty Chinese restaurant, everybody good...  It's...  First of all, not everybody...  And I'm telling you, growing up, the way I grew up, tipping, it's not the thing,  okay?  Secondly, it's very...  Sometimes it's difficult math-wise to even know.  So if you go, sometimes a motherfucker will pay $50 and go, well, $5?  Like they don't know 20 times, you know, $10. 
[02:50:30]  It's $10.  So a lot of times you go out with cash and you go to Red Lobster, you have $60.  The bill comes to $58.95.  Here's your $60, but keep the $2.  A lot of people don't know.  A lot of people, if they knew, they would fucking tip and they would plan for fucking tipping.  It's easy.  Move the decimal one place to the left and then double it.  We continue with more of our tribute to Patrice O'Neal.  Hello, everyone. 
[02:51:00]  This is Danny from the Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're all talking about Patrice today.  And something that I remembered about Patrice that I kind of wanted to share with everybody  was just his mastery of the moment on stage where he couldn't let anything get to him.  And if he felt that he was bothered or some people that were in the front were bothering him,  he just couldn't be shaken.  And I'll never forget one time I was down at Stand Up New York specifically to see Patrice. 
[02:51:30]  And there was a table of probably seven or eight girls, you know, young women, probably early 20s for some girls night out thing.  And they were just yapping and making noise and everything.  And Patrice, this is one of the most brilliant things I've ever seen by a comedian dude to get his way on that stage.  And he basically singled out the prettiest girl from that group and flirted with her and then just bought her and only her the rest of her drinks for the night.  It was the most brilliant instance of divide and conquer to get his own way on stage. 
[02:52:00]  All he wanted was to shut this group of women up, and he did so on his terms.  And I thought that was just a brilliant thing.  Stay tuned.  Our tribute continues with more moments from Patrice O'Neal on the Opie and Anthony Show after this.  We continue with more of our tribute to Patrice O'Neal.  Hey, it's Sam Roberts from this show.  Obviously, we lost a great one in Patrice O'Neal.  He's probably the closest of all the friends to the show. 
[02:52:30]  He was probably the closest.  I know up until his last appearance, he was the one guy that pretty much all of us on staff were still elated the night before he was coming in.  We knew it would always be a good show.  Whenever Patrice was in, he's a guy who it's a lot easier to celebrate his life now and do it as much as we're doing it.  Because we really celebrated his life while he was still alive. 
[02:53:00]  And we did that in the sense of bringing him into the studio every time we could have him in.  Giving him the reign to do whatever he wanted and letting the audience get to know him.  I feel like as a fan, and I said this on the After Show before, we're all kind of blessed to have gotten to be a part of getting to know who he was as a comedian on the show.  Just listening in and getting to watch him develop into this amazing comedian that only would have continued to do more. 
[02:53:30]  I'm so thankful for not only getting to hear that, but just being able to have conversations with him is something that I know I'm going to be able to be happy about for the rest of my life.  Because it's something that at this point, unfortunately, not everybody will have gotten to do.  So I'm very happy that we're getting to do this special.  Chris, you helped him too in a weird way because when you were on the show at K-Rock with us and Patrice was in, 
[02:54:00]  and it kind of turned into an intervention because you were telling him that you wanted him for your show.  And he might have been hard to be here.  And you told him kind of with love.  And that really absolutely changed him.  I love the guy.  I, you know, he's just one of those guys that the moment he started getting out of his own way. 
[02:54:30]  That's exactly it.  It was all going to open up for him.  And that's what was happening.  And when I was on the show, and by the way, what I did on the show is what I did to every time I saw him.  I was like, buddy, you're funnier than everybody.  Jesus.  Embrace it.  Come in.  Smile.  Don't worry.  The white man is not going to beat your ass today.  It's okay. 
[02:55:00]  You know?  He loved putting a spark to a bridge, though.  He loved putting a spark to a bridge.  Oh, boy.  Burn a bridge like that guy.  Oh, amazing.  And it was fucking hilarious.  But, like, oh, so you'd just be like, what are you doing?  Yeah, it's like, cross it first, then burn it.  Yeah, that really did help Patrice, I think, when Chris, that day he was in, because it got to him.  Because Chris wasn't coming at him like, you asshole.  He was like, I wanted to give you.  It was extremely real, remember?  Yeah.  And I think.  We were like, whoa.  And I think Patrice realized it.  And Patrice listened, too. 
[02:55:30]  You know what?  One of the only times you've watched Patrice actually sit back and listen.  And now, Chris Rock joins the program.  What?  Am I on?  Yeah, no, you're on.  Sorry.  Is this thing on?  See?  We can't even figure out which mic works the last day before vacation.  I'm sorry.  I realize it's just the same as, like, school.  Remember in school before vacation or before you left for summer, nothing got done?  I know nothing about school.  Exactly.  Nothing.  School's for white people.  Well, I sure missed it. 
[02:56:00]  Books and learning.  Maybe it was the Sicilian in me.  I missed it.  A lot of it.  I just went for the first half to learn a little bit of math.  And some English.  Shop skills.  And then I move on.  I have better things to do.  Yeah.  This is Chris's first time here.  This is my first time.  Him and Patrice were talking about something.  And apparently he complimented Patrice.  And I got to say, I didn't like it.  Let me say this.  It was a weird thing.  I'm sitting there, the first part of the story.  It was, I thought, somebody just started in trouble. 
[02:56:30]  And I thought, it's Chris.  Well, retell the story.  I'll make believe I didn't hear this.  Well.  Because it was really good.  I had to thank him because one comic said that Chris Rock said that you auditioned for  Everybody Hates Chris as the father, talking about me, and said I was awful.  I go, no.  I was good at that audition.  So, Keith called me.  Keith was there.  So, Keith goes, ah, man, no, no, no, no. 
[02:57:00]  He didn't say that at all.  He said you were great.  And he told me the real story.  So, and I'm just, this is.  You were great.  You just didn't know any of your lines.  But I didn't.  You were very unprepared and very self-deprecating.  But you were great.  You were actually the best one that day.  I could have got the father, but I thought I knew my line.  Put it this way.  I always say in auditions, I gave myself a chance to get it.  But I'm very aloof in auditions.  Because I don't want to get too, like, I want it or too, I don't want it. 
[02:57:30]  I went in.  So, why try?  Him and all these guys.  Why try?  I was just saying, this is how I'm going to be as a father.  But the word was, okay, he was the best, but he didn't get it because of some other stuff.  But I actually felt good about that.  Yeah.  That I was the best.  So, you finally got an opportunity to ask Chris if that was true or not.  Oh, you were great.  But here's the thing I heard is that I had an attitude, and I didn't.  I know when I have an attitude.  I'm not going to say I'm not an ass. 
[02:58:00]  You can't have an attitude.  You came in.  I feel like I'm such an ass.  This is good stuff.  I feel like Mr. Slate.  Like I'm Trump.  The reason you were let go.  But I don't like to give black bosses any less type of respect than white bosses. 
[02:58:30]  I don't want to look at Chris and go, ah-ha, Chris.  And when I go into white things, and I'm acting right.  I went in there to try to be business, act right.  How many black bosses have you really been in front of the road?  You're saying like there's so many black bosses out there.  You act like you're popular among white people.  And when have you ever been like nice or diplomatic?  I want it to be the same, exactly the same.  Yeah, well.  And why don't you kiss up to Chris Rock? 
[02:59:00]  He's in studio.  He doesn't have to kiss up to me.  You're self-destructive.  I'm not self-destructive.  Look who's telling you that.  Right.  I know a thing about being self-destructive.  I think you're being a little self-destructive.  You're being a little too cool for the room in front of Chris Rock.  What are you talking about now?  Yeah.  But don't think me and Chris don't both know white tricks.  This is not dividing, Piker.  I basically said thank you for the compliment, because I heard the compliment.  So his acting was good? 
[02:59:30]  His acting was very good.  His acting was very good.  He just didn't know the part.  And he was very, he was just killing himself.  He was basically screaming, don't hire me.  Oh, Patrice.  You know something?  That's the Patrice we know.  That sounds just like Patrice.  This is the man we know.  I swear to God.  Absolutely sounds just like him.  I know when I'm being like that, but I wasn't.  And the guy that he went against was like, I'm ready to do this.  I know every lot.  And he probably wasn't as good as Patrice.  But he was so like, I will do everything you need to do, Mr. Rock. 
[03:00:00]  You know what?  Don't worry about it.  It's not like it's a hit show right now.  Yeah, it's not like you see the bus boards and the billboards.  When I saw your E!  True Hollywood story, you were the same way.  I was.  I was.  And I straightened out.  Oh, all right.  All right.  That's his advice.  I'm going to try.  You should learn from Chris.  I'm learning from Chris.  I'm going to learn now.  Terry Crews was great.  Yeah.  You were really good.  How many seasons are you in on that show?  We're, I think, we just finished three. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, so we got ready to start four.  We have four seasons.  What do you do?  What do you do?  Is that why you asked the next question?  Of course we did.  Actually, no, I never heard that story until you said that.  No, I wouldn't rub it.  I'm happy that I heard that.  Syndication.  Bonnie starts rolling.  I was wondering, when you go into a show that stars like a kid, do you think, ah, if  we get a year out of this, we're lucky?  And now you must start thinking, this kid's getting older.  He's really old and his voice is changed and he's shaven.  Yeah.  It's like, what?  He's got hemorrhoids.  You got the Harry Potter problem. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, we got the, well, I wish I'd, well, that's some problem.  That's a good problem to have.  It happened with, like, the 1D years and stuff, where I think they go into it thinking, we're  lucky if it's even on the air, and then it gets to the point where it's like, dad, I'm  home, and it's not quite the wonder years anymore, you know, it's not this innocent  child thing.  Now he's, you know, driving and having sex.  Sleeping with his aunt.  Yeah.  And his show, Everybody Loves Chris, was one of the few ones that made the leap when 
[03:01:30]  they combined and made the CW when UPN closed down.  Oh, that's right.  And his and, like, a couple others were the only ones that moved over to the new network.  Right.  Yes, because all the shows were so great, they had to figure out, what's going to make it?  That was just, you could hear the collective click of white people hitting the remotes on  some of those shows.  It's like, what, there's four girls, and they're living together, and they're working.  I have no idea what that's about.  Click. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  I had no real interest in seeing that.  What?  What?  Why don't you just start it with, I'm a racist?  Yeah.  I didn't say, I'm a racist.  I like my shows with a black friend.  That's what you're really saying.  An occasional black friend is great on the show.  He has one cast.  He has one important scene every season.  That's where I feel.  Anthony goes, just sticks from Happy Days.  Right. 
[03:02:30]  Give us sticks.  Look, what happened to those days?  Anthony goes, I'm not watching UPN Word.  I don't call it that.  Jesus Christ.  I just need something I can relate to a little.  Us as humans, we're just watching things we can relate to a little more.  It's like Steve Nash.  You want to see you.  Just so Chris understands.  It's like Nash, right?  Anthony is.  Yes.  You root for Nash?  Right.  Of course you root for Nash.  Anthony's a big fan.  Oh my God, root for Nash. 
[03:03:00]  Anthony's a big fan of the History Channel, but he likes to call it the Hitler Channel, just  so you know who you're dealing with.  Well, it's the big H in the corner and stuff, of course.  And no, I'm a fan of the era.  Right.  It's amazing that Hitler can have a channel and O.J. can't get a channel.  O.J. only killed two people.  They're fascinated with Hitler.  Hitler gets a whole channel.  Networks.  Every bit of film of that guy has been shown.  Everything.  He's a drug addict now.  There's no Hitler outtakes.  I saw one the other day. 
[03:03:30]  Hitler went sandal shopping.  Really?  Yeah, some rare footage.  A whole hour.  A whole hour of Hitler picking out sandals.  They find two lousy seconds of Hitler footage and they make an hour out of it on the Hitler  channel.  O.J.  See, now I'm saying it.  Nothing for O.J.  Nothing for O.J.  Hey, Chris is playing the garden.  We've got to get the plug in, man.  It's amazing to be doing that room.  It's funny.  We think we're off the air.  We said this.  But I'm like, are you doing the two rooms?  The little garden?  I'm doing the Dane Cook garden.  The Dane Cook garden.  The Dane Cook garden.  Oh my God.  It's renamed.  That is the elephant in the room, too, because you're sitting there going, how do you ask 
[03:04:00]  somebody, are you playing the real garden garden or the other thing?  But the other thing is 5,000 seats.  It's so impressive, yes.  Yeah, that's the mini garden.  Okay, so you're doing four nights.  Four nights and then, Jesus.  How come I do one big garden, because that adds up to four of the little gardens?  There's like insurance issues.  Let me explain a real thing.  Yeah, you've got to explain the rules.  I know.  When you're settling up at the chuckle hut at the end of the night. 
[03:04:30]  I'm sitting there.  You sit there with the guy from the raining night house.  So you're going over, Tony Camacho has the check.  You ask him not to drop checks.  John Mulrooney is working with you.  Do you ask him not to drop checks?  Big up to Mulrooney.  Do they have wings at the garden?  We might have rings.  I've been trying to get Kentucky Fried Chicken to give out two pieces at the end of the night. 
[03:05:00]  I wonder if you might make more doing four nights at the other one.  You can make more money, yeah, because the union is insane.  Very expensive New York rooms are very expensive.  I mean, I understand some of the big rooms.  This is all business stuff.  Not that, of course.  It's all business.  Yes, yes.  Something you don't know nothing about.  I'll be at comics next week.  I'm trying to sell four shows.  Patrice decided it was a good idea to get a website a mere three months ago.  Wow.  Remember all the times you would come on the show and be like, do you have a website to promote yourself?  See, that's how you get the show.  Exactly.  That's how he did this.  He doesn't know how to promote. 
[03:05:30]  He goes, I feel weird promoting.  Do you see him trying now?  You are trying.  Jesus.  Patrice's brilliance is as a comedian.  You're playing some big rooms now, right?  You know, I'll get back to you.  Yes.  It's funny.  As a business fan, it's time to plug myself.  Yeah, I'm doing maybe a thousand is probably the maximum.  That's so funny.  Hey, you're out the clubs.  Yeah.  You made it.  That's the goal of every comic is to get out of the chuckle huts.  My only goal, I swear to you, was to be famous enough to not have to do radio. 
[03:06:00]  That was it.  Not that I'm going to be up now, but I mean, you know.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't have to do radio and I don't have to stay in the comedian condo.  That's all I wanted.  I knew you were on the road.  I wanted to be like down my era.  George Wallace was my goal.  He's been on the show a bunch.  That was my goal.  You shot past that.  Jesus Christ.  We should talk about the condo thing.  A lot of people out there don't understand.  When you guys go to these cities, you have to stay in the same condo that other comics 
[03:06:30]  were in a week before.  The same sheets.  Right.  Because they're trying to just save money.  So these guys buy an actual condo.  Comedians are disgusting.  Right.  Right.  I can't even imagine.  You got to share.  You got to share.  Sometimes with.  I've done so many gigs with a headliner in the middle act.  Sometimes you have to share.  If you're not a headliner, you share the room with the.  Some strange comic.  You barely know.  Like damn near bunk beds.  Right.  It's like.  Ugh.  Yeah, I've done that.  I woke up on time.  It was three comedians in a room. 
[03:07:00]  And I woke up and the two guys had left.  We had like a two hour drive to the next game.  They just left a note.  Like we'll meet you there.  Dirt bags.  Stint.  Don.  You ever had that thing where you're at the club and they have the meal, the menu,  and then there's the stuff the headliner can eat.  But if you're an opener.  Oh, no way.  You can't get shrimp.  You know.  The chintzy ass.  What crap is that?  We don't.  The middles can't get scallops.  We're sorry.  You can have the chicken wings.  Chicken wings for you.  I was doing a club recently up in Massachusetts and they said that the MCs, the opening acts 
[03:07:30]  couldn't get soda.  I'm like, you don't give the guys.  I can see alcohol on that.  You know what I don't like?  Wow.  I saw one that said, don't touch the waitresses.  Was that a problem?  You know what's bothering me about this conversation?  What?  That Norton and Chris Rock are having a nostalgic conversation that I still live.  If you had the right attitude, you're as funny as both of us.  I'm not going to sit here and say I'm funnier than you. 
[03:08:00]  I guess it's not going to tell you this is an intervention for you.  We thought we were having Chris Rock to promote his New Year's gig, but it's really an intervention  to get you on the right track.  How do people be able to move on from old school news?  I'm not like that.  I'll tell you what it is.  As a comedian...  You're like Whitney Houston.  You're going to have to be clean for 10 years before we buy it.  You're like, ooh, we're supposed to just buy it now and clean.  But she's looking good again.  Yeah, yeah.  She's looking good.  You've got to prove it to the public.  I need four crackless albums before I buy it. 
[03:08:30]  I'm going to have to be like Michael Vick after he gets out.  I'm going to take care of dogs.  He's going to work at his shelter.  You've got to pet every dog you see walking by.  You're going to have to shake hands with a few audience members.  They walk out by the club owner for having you.  Because it's not your act.  People love your act.  People love your act.  It's who you are.  They hate you.  It's garbage.  They just hate you as a person.  This is your intervention.  I've been waiting for this day.  There is no awful human beings. 
[03:09:00]  I'm a good person.  I'm just...  You've just got to think about you.  I can name 10 guys you're funnier than you.  And you know what?  This is how you know...  They're way more successful than you.  This is...  Chris is talking to me like a middle-aged white man.  That's how middle-aged white people talk to me.  You know I'm finished because Chris is like,  Look, my son.  You need to work on this.  If you think it's just jokes, you got...  Jokes are only half the battle. 
[03:09:30]  Every conversation you have about Patrice goes to this.  He's a funny guy.  This is years ago, boy.  This is in the mid-90s.  This was...  I used to do this.  I met him.  I hated...  He's a pomposity.  I met him, and he was like,  We're doing this hell gig for Jamie Dukin.  It was a college.  I was opening...  You keep telling that story.  I killed that room, by the way.  You didn't kill it.  It doesn't matter.  It's not about the comedy.  It's not about the jokes.  It's the delusion of who he is. 
[03:10:00]  I had maybe a one.  I'm wrong.  Help me help you.  He's Rod Tidwell.  I like to see him sweat.  It's rare you sweat on our show, man.  All right.  I'm a breather.  Nobody's got a bad thing to say.  No.  No.  Not as funny.  Just my essence stinks.  Before they trash you, they'll say things like,  Yeah, it's funny. 
[03:10:30]  Are you friends with him?  Patrice O'Neill will not be at the garden.  He'll be at the undergarden.  Chris Rock wants to make it perfectly clear.  He doesn't want you painting his garden appearance.  There's the 5,000.  There's the 20,000.  And then there's the bathroom.  Oh, poor Patrice.  Hey, are you working with anybody in the garden? 
[03:11:00]  Jill Scott.  Jill Scott for the ladies.  She's opening?  Yeah, she's opening.  Wow.  I don't know Jill Scott.  I don't either.  Okay.  I want to find out about...  If you're having sex with a black woman, you'd know.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  She's big.  Yeah.  Neo soul, as they used to call it.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Oh, wait.  She's the performer.  She does music.  Yeah, yeah.  I knew...  All right.  I know who...  Oh, she's not a comic?  No, no.  Oh, you was thinking comedian Jill Scott.  I was thinking comedian Jill Scott.  I've heard of Jill Scott.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't really know what she...  I just know she's in music.  That's smart.  Have music in front of you, because this way you don't have to worry about somebody stepping  on everything you want to talk about. 
[03:11:30]  Exactly.  That's why Pryor did it with Patti LaBelle.  Exactly.  I'm going to start doing that music.  When I saw Dane Cook at the Garden, it was just him and a stool.  Yep.  No opening act, nothing.  Hour and a half.  Dane just came out.  Yeah.  That was...  I'm like, wow, that's pretty pompous.  Not even a warm-up.  35 minutes of scream.  Right, right.  Give us a bed or something to hang out with for a while.  I hate working in the round.  Not that I have an opportunity to do it.  Believe me, I very rarely do it.  Shut up, stupid.  But you're not in the round yet.  Not even in Westbury.  You can't count the Westbury Music Fair.  I'm only doing half. 
[03:12:00]  Believe me, every time I'm in the round, there's a curtain.  It's like, wow, we'd all be more intimate.  You're in the crescent.  And no one wants to see your back.  You were getting to something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When you hosted the Oscars, all we had to hear was from Rich Voss about how he was writing  for Chris Rock.  Good.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  Finally.  And all I wanted to do is...  He might have got a couple in there.  Did he?  Yeah, I think he got a couple. 
[03:12:30]  He bragged about that for a year.  He got a couple in the intros.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All he was talking about, though, is, well, I got to get over and see Chris where I'm  writing.  It's like, what could you possibly be writing?  He would call us from L.A. in between writing sessions.  And just talk about that.  Make sure everyone knew what he was doing.  Every time we talked to him, he had to bring that up.  Yeah.  And it's still one of his big credits.  How long after you hired Voss did you realize, all right, this was a mistake?  He's a nice guy, but he contributes very little, and he's dumb.  He'd have some stuff. 
[03:13:00]  Dumb as dirt.  He'd have some stuff.  I forgot you hosted, man.  That was so great.  It was so fun to watch.  It was so great, they never called again.  Good, though.  What the hell was that about?  Wait, wait.  Did it again?  Hold on.  I'll tell you what that's about.  That means he did a great job.  As a comedian...  No, I'm serious.  You were a comedian doing the Oscars.  It was great to watch.  Just smashing them.  I loved it.  That stupid Jude Law.  Oh, who is he?  That was so great.  And then Sean Pan, who's one of our finest.  Shut your mouth.  One of our finest actors.  It's like Sean...  Boy, what a sense of humor that guy's got.  Chris, we'll say it. 
[03:13:30]  Sean should have taken the...  You know, take the joke.  Oh, what a douche.  My God.  It was just nice to see a comic doing that and not being polite to him, but really tearing  the throats up.  Absolutely.  It was great, man.  Thank you.  Could you hang for a little longer?  Patrice, see how I said thank you?  Yeah.  Wait a minute, let me practice a long way.  That goes a long way, Patrice.  Thank you, Chris.  See, I'm going to follow it.  Let me just practice saying thank you to people.  Just say something to me, Owen.  I don't have anything I can say to you.  It's okay.  How about the...  Thanks anyway for...  Thanks anyway for... 
[03:14:00]  I'm trying to learn.  Instead of going, ugh.  This is Patrice in a compliment, because he is a sweet guy, but he doesn't...  He doesn't want anyone to know that.  He doesn't know how to get love.  He's got that tough outer shell that you've got to break through.  If you said Patrice, that hosting job you did was so good that one time,  Shut up!  Right, right.  That's Patrice.  Patrice doesn't realize...  I know!  He doesn't realize he's a big black man.  So he thinks he's going, hey, how you doing?  But what we hear is...  Ooga booga!  Thank you so much for the opportunity.  Ooga booga booga booga booga! 
[03:14:30]  People who don't like Patrice hate him.  Because he gets to people, because if he teases you, he's loud.  You're not going to be louder than he is.  I never realized he couldn't take a compliment properly,  because I had complimented you on your appearances on The Office,  even though they were very brief, but you were very good.  Can I tell you really quickly why...  People always, when they write for Patrice, they make sure they can write him out, too.  I don't know how this is going to work. 
[03:15:00]  Put a pre-existing medical condition in the character description.  It starts off with diabetes in the show!  He's boisterous with a heart condition.  Just in case!  That fun-loving, weak-hearted man...  It starts off with diabetes in a doctor's appointment.  First episode.  First episode!  You could go into a coma in season two.  They don't want to lose a minute of production time.  If you're lucky.  Oh, man. 
[03:15:30]  Actually, Arrested Development, too.  I love that show.  I think I got thrown out of there for the same reason.  Why?  I don't think I said thank you.  Yeah, see, that's your problem.  What are you going to do?  I don't...  What are you...  Just...  See?  Just be nice!  I think we only...  Do you have to be somewhere?  We only have you for another ten minutes or so?  Whatever you need.  I'm here.  Can we take a quick break and then continue?  For you?  Sure.  Oh, wow.  And he doesn't like doing radio, so that's a compliment.  Who does?  Jesus Christ.  That's too early.  Do that one more time.  For you?  See, I know.  See, there was nothing in me to even know to say that. 
[03:16:00]  That was just acting, though.  But it was...  That wasn't sincere.  That was just acting.  No, but I know!  That's what he's saying!  We continue to celebrate the life of Patrice O'Neal.  God damn!  With more of his greatest moments on the Opie and Anthony show, next.  We continue with more of our tribute to Patrice O'Neal.  Hey, it's Travis from the Opie and Anthony show.  I think the thing that I'm going to miss most about Patrice is that he would always call 
[03:16:30]  me for some reason to get booked on the show.  He knew that Roland was a booker, but for some reason he would always call me.  And, you know, we'd talk our business and then we would just sometimes end up talking  about nothing for 30 minutes.  And those little things, just talking to him during commercial breaks about, you know,  him and Sam would talk about wrestling or we'd talk about video games.  And it's just...  You're not going to come across a nicer guy in this business. 
[03:17:00]  And it's really sad that he's gone.  And life's really unfair.  And this is one of those times that it's really unfair.  And this is everyone's loss.  This isn't just the loss of the comedy world or the Opie and Anthony show.  This is everyone's loss.  And I think we all see that.  So we're all really going to miss him. 
[03:17:30]  Remembering Patrice O'Neal, his greatest moments on ONA.  He loved Pat Cooper, too.  And Pat liked him a lot.  They were great on top crowd together.  And we had both of them on.  Oh, were they in together?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, they worked well together.  Two fucking loud guys.  Patrice would just start railing on him.  Oh, it was great.  Pat loved him.  Let's get Pat Cooper in here before he fucking loses his mind.  I hear he's yelling and screaming.  Roland, was he yelling and screaming down the hall?  Oh, sorry, bro.  Sorry.  Oh, look.  Very calm.  Four guys to walk into this break. 
[03:18:00]  I know, right?  What the hell?  Are you yelling, Pat?  All right, bro.  Do me a bit.  Sit up straight.  You're not going to come to my house and you sit like that.  Break my head.  Sit up straight.  Good morning.  Opie, Anthony.  How are you?  Where's the baby?  Pat Cooper.  Thank you, Pat.  The baby's fine.  I'm busting my balls, huh?  Yeah.  No, were you yelling down?  What's happening?  Were you yelling down the hall?  Everyone's, we got a full report.  You were yelling.  Hiya, bro.  He's a little man.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Hi, Pat.  Patrice O'Neal.  Hey, why don't you try? 
[03:18:30]  Pat Cooper.  Pat's putting his headphones on.  I don't know.  With this fakakta thing.  Will somebody help this old man with the fucking headphones, please?  Don't call them old.  Jesus.  Anthony, how you doing, baby?  I'm doing good.  Thank you, Paisan.  God bless.  Nice.  Thanks for having me on because I know the ratings were going down.  Yeah, that's what happens.  Hello, I know.  So we figured.  What am I?  What am I yesterday?  The ratings were going down and we figured we'd just get rid of all of them.  Okay.  There we go.  Ready to broadcast.  Ready for action, Pat Cooper.  Why are you looking at me? 
[03:19:00]  I'm looking at you because I can't believe you guys are still here.  I know.  I say that with love.  I don't know how people in this country with no talent get lucky.  It's amazing.  What do they hire you as one of our bosses?  Anthony, you don't need anybody.  You understand?  You're holding.  I'm up all these years.  I know.  What are you going to do?  What's new, Pat?  Pat.  Yeah, what are you up to, Pat?  Come on.  I'm not talking to you yet.  I'll let you know.  I'll let you know in four minutes.  We've gotten uppity over the years, but I'm sorry. 
[03:19:30]  You work together.  Now I know why your friend North quit.  North quit.  I miss him.  He's a nice man.  I just thought he's eight by ten.  It sucks.  It does.  These guys think they're good looking.  I mean, you know, they got the hair coiffed and everything.  He's a comic.  Shut up.  Do your comedy.  Forget about coiffing.  Coiffing.  That's Patrice O'Neal.  Yeah.  We did some time with him on Tough Crowd. 
[03:20:00]  I don't know who this gentleman is.  He touched me one more time.  I'm going to knock him on his ass.  Oh, you think?  I'm going to keep it even with your copper tunnel, sir.  I'm going to get in this martial arts.  All right.  Let's get some water here.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Now I'm just going to eat.  All right.  What's going on?  You're eating while I'm talking?  You need anything?  Yeah.  You know, Opie, you got some pair of balls.  You're eating while I'm talking.  What a pair of balls.  You need anything?  You need some water?  I don't want nothing but to get out of here fast.  Yeah.  Why did you move me from eight to nine?  What is this shit? 
[03:20:30]  Well, we figured we could coast and let you just shine.  No, no.  I don't want to shine because you knocked out my sleeping pattern.  Can you ask Pat how guys got famous back in his day?  Yeah.  What happened?  Without Twitter.  How did guys get famous back in the day, back in your day, without all this electronic  media and Twitter and emails and sending out flyer things, electronic flyers?  How did people get famous?  Because they're talented.  Oh. 
[03:21:00]  See, that's the part that's left out.  Let me tell you something.  Without the electronic shit, 90% of them wouldn't get a fucking job.  Right.  And I'm telling you, you're one of them.  I know.  Hey, Pat, I snuck in right under the wire.  I got right in there when I had to.  I don't care about yesterday and I don't care about today because it's over.  It's done?  For who?  It's done for me and that's the end of it and this is the last hurrah.  Well, if it's done for you, how come I'm seeing stories about you? 
[03:21:30]  Well, because I got to, listen, I got to come here with something.  I can't come here and hope to God that you ad-lib.  That's a safe thing to do.  Why'd you bring this schmuck along with you?  I need him because Jewish people in this business have what you call power.  He's my only Jew that I know with power.  And he's a good man and he's a helpful man and he's right there when you need him.  And he's a good guy.  And, listen, I've had a lot of managers, a lot of agents. 
[03:22:00]  Thank God he's not one of them.  But he's a good guy.  You ever been screwed over by a manager or agent over the years?  I had, I'd say, about six or seven managers and I'd had about maybe 200 agents.  I told you, I got called this morning, 8 o'clock, and all she's going to make is a $12 commission for 2012.  That's when you know the country's fucked up.  What the fuck is that?  I told her I'd give her $20 fucking dollars to leave me alone.  And she turned it down because then I feel I'm not in show business. 
[03:22:30]  Look at this shit.  A condo?  Hey, it's work.  So what is it, the clubhouse area?  It's 1,100-seater.  It's like the Radio City Music Hall.  It's wonderful.  You know, I love doing the condos.  They're nice people.  But not, you know, not 8 o'clock in the morning for a 2,000 o'clock.  So it's like Mr. Saturday Night Grimes?  That's the third time he interrupted me.  You're fucking like an old man guy?  One more time, I'm going to hate black people.  Oh, my God.  So do you go out there and go, hey, Jim, what's with your fucking hair? 
[03:23:00]  You see, he wants to be known with a body like that he can't miss.  Oh, shit.  I can't believe he's doing fucking Mr. Saturday Night shit.  The man is not in my fucking league.  Does he understand?  Just make this, I'm hurt.  Why are you hurt?  Because it's like Pat's still relevant, man.  He's not a...  You see, he's fighting for laughs.  This whole show is a fucking laugh.  How the hell could you fight for laughs?  We gave up fighting. 
[03:23:30]  We gave up fighting.  He's going to go out tonight.  Don't let turn out the star.  He's the quickest guy in the world.  Nobody come near me.  No fucking body.  Remember those words.  Jesus.  And that's why I think anger keeps you...  You should see him walk around the neighborhood.  You see how nice guys are now?  They put a stamp on my fucking talent.  They go, well, he has an attitude.  Oh, I don't have talent.  I'm not talking to you.  Oh, sorry.  You understand?  Sorry.  You know, I'm only bringing a point.  I don't mean that disrespectful to you.  But people say, well, you know what?  See, Pat, you know why last day there's an attitude. 
[03:24:00]  I say, what about fucking talent?  When do I get fucking, you know, hey?  But let's be honest, Pat.  There is a little bit of anger.  It's a little bit of anger there.  I'm going to move up the heart and pee on the people.  It's just...  Pat, it's a little anger.  I think that keeps you...  It's not anger, it's called talent, you sick fuck.  What's the matter with you?  I don't...  I think all the...  All the...  He's a lonely fucking man.  All the slobber coming up the side of your mouth, man.  It's not just talented.  That's not talented spit. 
[03:24:30]  It's a little bit of his anger.  You think there's some anger coming from you?  He's praying toward Caroline's.  I am there March 2nd.  He is, he is.  He's going to be there next week.  There he goes.  He's going to be there soon, Pat.  So you think it's all talent, no attitude?  Isn't there that balance?  It's all in one.  Yeah.  First of all, you've got to have the confidence in yourself.  Right.  And don't listen to people who think they know comedy and don't belong and know disrespect to this gentleman, of course.  All right, then we have to ask you to leave. 
[03:25:00]  I tell you, I got confidence.  And if I didn't have confidence, I wouldn't last this far.  And I'm 82.  Sure.  I hope my buddy here will last 82 because it's not easy anymore.  It really isn't.  Can I just...  This is why I'm glad I'm deaf.  I go back with him.  I go back with you.  How many?  A little while back.  A little while.  A little bit.  I don't want to upset you, but these rat bastards don't want to say it behind your back and say you were a substitute.  Tootene.  Tootene. 
[03:25:30]  No, they did.  I know I'm a substitute.  Jimmy, you know.  We miss little Jimmy North.  I got to ask something about when you get to the place.  Okay, when you get to the place where you're not having sex anymore, right?  What is the desire?  Where is the sexual?  What is it?  What's it boiled up into now?  Is it just like you look and go, oh, that's just...  Boy, I would...  Back in the day, I would.  Like, what keeps you going?  No.  You want the truth or you want the bullshit?  No, I want the truth.  I want to make tomorrow.  That's my future. 
[03:26:00]  What else am I going to tell you?  My thing, I've done it all.  I've done everything I ever wanted to do.  I opened fucking doors in this business, not comedically, although I was the first Italian  to go out in the open and say I am Italian, but that's beside the point.  I don't know if Italians hit you.  I opened doors because I told the rat bastards in my business that they're rat bastards.  Right.  And nobody had the balls to do it.  Right.  So remember that.  Now, all of a sudden, everybody wants to kiss each other's ass.  I never did that.  And I never took away my dignity for no fucking body. 
[03:26:30]  That's about pussy, Pat.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Pussy is over.  When you had the best, it's downhill.  There's no more.  I listen to me.  I watch a porno and I dance to it.  And you ever mess with any stars?  No.  Like, no.  No.  I humped regular people who had regular fucking jobs.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I tell you then.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yes.  No fucking. 
[03:27:00]  No primatons.  And the closest I came to a celebrity abroad, a wonderful broad, she says to me, you want  to put what?  Where?  And I didn't know what she was talking about and I blew that.  Oh, shit.  Who was it?  Who was it?  Well, fuck pussy.  It doesn't matter no more.  That's all.  The Kardashians, 65 million because they have an envelope between their legs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what does that tell you?  What the hell does it mean today?  It's no, they don't have to have talent.  It's a post.  You make a porno?  She made a porno so they're making big money.  I make a porno, they'll lock me up.  They will lock me up. 
[03:27:30]  Who is the funniest woman you've ever seen in your life?  Phyllis Diller.  Phyllis Diller?  Yeah.  Nobody like Phyllis Diller.  What a wonderful lady.  I tell you, not only that, great pianist, great everything.  You know, we all look at stand-up comedy today as just stand-up comedy.  There's no more genius anymore that we turn around and say, you know something?  There's too many bad comics out there that are not having a system.  They're one subject matter, either pussy, cock, dying, or rehab. 
[03:28:00]  What do you think about Joan Rivers?  Do you ever like her?  I will say this about Joan Rivers.  This is a talented lady.  I don't like her personally, but that's beside the point.  If you're talking about her talent, yes, but now she's getting on my fucking nerves.  Really?  Now she's on slides.  She's on television.  She's on radio.  She's gone to walking.  But she's such an unhappy, unhappy lady.  That's what we said.  And she does not like to be told because she can't take it.  She likes to give it.  She can't take it. 
[03:28:30]  But I'd say this.  She's a talented lady.  That's it.  Yeah, I saw a documentary on her, and she just looks like she never stops.  She's constantly on the go and didn't look very happy.  No.  Because when you cover your heart, your heart don't pump right.  See, she thinks by changing her face, that's changing her.  She's still a rat bastard, and that's what's going to happen.  You can't hide rat bastards.  You can't have a rat bastard-ectomy.  I'm calling women rat bastards.  Rat bastards.  You're a rat bastard.  But she's a talented lady, and she's just a... 
[03:29:00]  I really believe she's a lonely lady.  I really believe that.  But then again, who the fuck cares?  I mean, she's doing great.  She's going to make $90 million and drop dead like everybody else.  What the fuck called she's losing?  Who was your comedy mentor, sir?  I had a lot of them.  Who'd you look up to?  I looked up to Milton Berle.  I thought he was one of the great Shecky Green.  Who took you under their wing?  You're interrupting my fucking flow.  I'm sorry, sorry about that.  Why do you ask me a question, then you answer it?  Because I don't know, sir.  There's a drop, and no disrespect, there's a drop of senility there that I have to... 
[03:29:30]  I have to check.  I just have to make sure you're going to go, because I did ask you a sex question, and  you went on to sing the Star-Spangled Banner.  I'm saying, sir, you're still interrupting him now.  I'm sorry.  He's fuming over there.  Who took you under their wing?  You know what kills me?  No, man.  I'm sorry.  I'm on your side.  You know what kills me?  What's that, Pat?  He's going to be part of my great show today. 
[03:30:00]  Ah, yeah.  Don't answer the question.  He went with Milton Berle and Shecky?  No, I'm saying, who took you under their wing?  He was getting there.  Jackie Gleason.  Gleason.  Yeah, I'd say...  That's right there.  Guys like Henny Youngman I love, guys like Shecky Green and Jack Carter, so I grew up in  that era.  In fact, I was just watching a roast a couple of nights ago, and they were so fucking on  the money.  It was a different kind of a quality in comedy.  No disrespect to the people today, but they had a... 
[03:30:30]  Today, they had a purpose, and their purpose was to be funny.  Today, they're either looking for a series, or they want to show you who can say fuck  better than anybody.  So there's no depth anymore.  It's no fucking depth.  It's just like anybody in their fucking business wants to be a comic.  I'm getting drilled by a dentist, because I want to talk to you about my jokes.  Fuck you and your jokes.  Fuck you and your drill.  Fuck you and your dental.  Fuck you.  I ain't coming here no more.  And I left, and I just gargled my throat and spit the shit out.  That's it.  Why did they leave me the fuck? 
[03:31:00]  I don't tell a butcher how to butch.  Don't tell me how to comic.  I know my fucking craft.  I've proven it over the fucking years, and what pisses the young comics around who say,  well, he's still around.  Fuck you.  How's that grab you?  And fuck you again.  Go to Caroline's where you fucking belong.  That's the end of your fucking career.  I love it.  I love it.  When they say, oh, Thursday.  Only Thursday he's coming.  Fuck him if he never comes. 
[03:31:30]  Only Thursday.  Just because they got a big sign outside.  What's his fucking name?  That guy with Affleck.  Affleck.  What's his name?  Oh, Gilbert.  Gilbert Gottfried.  Only Thursdays.  I pissed.  I got emotional.  Can you throw him next Friday in there for him?  Can you give him an extra fucking Tuesday?  Who the fuck cares?  His fucking fame is he talks like a duck.  What the fuck does that tell you?  I mean, I like him.  I can't believe that he's a fucking issue.  Gilbert Gottfried.  What did he ever do to you?  Very unhappy.  Who, Gilbert?  Very unhappy. 
[03:32:00]  Really?  Trust me.  I think that comes through.  He's going to wake up in Caroline.  That's what's pissing him off.  I think that comes through.  Why is Gilbert unhappy?  In his act, I think that comes through.  I don't know Gilbert.  He seems like an unhappy guy.  Gilbert doesn't do our show.  Why?  He's always been a Howard guy for years.  Oh, okay.  Well, I don't know.  That's whatever.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Gilbert is a fucking fountain of history, man.  I thought you were going to say of youth.  I was going to say, what are you?  Who's the, back in the day, who was the funniest black guy?  Who'd you respect?  Who got the respect back then?  Black guys.  I met Moms Mabley when she wasn't Moms Mabley. 
[03:32:30]  I met Red Foxx when he wasn't Red Foxx.  I met Richard Pryor, and in fact, I closed the roast.  And if you ever get a chance, call the fryers, let him give you a copy of that roast.  He was there in a wheelchair.  I mean, you look at a man that broke down barriers.  I mean, and why did they have to say, well, he's black and he's breaking down.  That's fucking bull.  He's human.  He broke down barriers.  Why the hell do we put people in fucking sections?  Why do you?  That's not something that was done by black people. 
[03:33:00]  See, he brings back slavery.  This fucking guy.  He brings back slavery.  He fucking brings back slavery.  He saw where you were going, Patrice.  He knows.  He's been around way too long.  You can't sneak that past him.  Oh, shit.  Did you ever mentor a black person in the game?  I fucked a black person.  Why?  I fuck anything when I was healthy and everything.  I enjoy women.  No, why are you breaking my balls with the fucking thing? 
[03:33:30]  No, did you mentor any black comedians?  The smartest black woman, the other day when she said on television, I'm not an African-American,  I'm an American, was Whoopi Goldberg.  And I said, if I meet Whoopi, I'm going to kiss her ass because that's a fucking, that's  a stand-up statement with this bullshit.  I'm an African.  I'm a born in this fucking country.  I'm not an American.  I'm an American.  So cut the shit with that black crap out.  It's over.  Now, get up there and tap dance for us.  I finally woke up to death. 
[03:34:00]  He's playing ping pong on the fucking computer.  Ping pong.  Oh, fuck, man.  God damn it.  There's nobody.  Listen to me.  Let me follow that up.  Anthony, I'll joke on the side.  And I say this with my ego.  Here's my ego.  There's nobody like me because I went out of my way in my career to at least be different. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  And that's what I am.  This gentleman here is different.  I mean, Whoopi is different.  That's what makes it special.  I tell all comics, don't worry.  You're going to get the last, but try to be different than other comics.  Don't be the same shit.  You know, try to get an attitude with your comic.  You know, they go, well, yeah, but I better talk about pussy.  So there's your answer.  Now, do you sound like you've forgiven yourself for any mistakes, but is there something that,  Is there an attitude or a moment or something in this game where you wish you could take back and redo? 
[03:35:00]  What's the booking this show today?  I lost two people in my life that I'm talking about professional now.  Well, actually not half professional.  I lost a man called Bernie Brillstein, who I love daily.  Brillstein Gray.  Yeah, Bernie Brillstein, who I thought didn't love me because I thought I had cancer in the throat and he went to Italy. 
[03:35:30]  And I told him to go fuck himself and I ate my tongue because he was a wonderful man to me.  And I said, and then after we got together again, I really felt bad.  Don't want to leave me alone this fucking day.  Don't want to leave me alone.  He won't even look at Patrice, by the way.  He hasn't looked at you the whole show.  He's sort of looking at you now.  Mr. Cooper, sir, when did you, when did the change, because everyone gets in this business with bright eyes and bushy tails. 
[03:36:00]  When did you just say, you motherfuckers?  At what point did you get, like, when did you become the Pat Cooper?  A lot of them don't get in with, you know, bright eyes.  A lot of them think fucking comedy is a joke.  It ain't.  It's a serious fucking business.  Comedy ain't a joke.  And let me tell you something.  It's got to be a joke.  You know, the singers that I idolize can sing the same songs over and over.  You hear?  A comic kid's doing it.  It's out the fucking door.  They don't have no more creativity. 
[03:36:30]  It's the same shit.  The same shit and the same shit.  Now, if they turn around, I can't point out anybody right now that I got to say is doing something other than motherfucker, cocksucker, motherfucker, cocksucker.  I don't see those comics, even the women.  They're out there.  All right.  I said it.  There's a guy in Omaha, I think.  It's Omaha, Nebraska.  He's now a ventriloquist to his cock.  That's how down we are.  That's how down we are.  He goes, I know what I'm hot on.  And then he goes, how are you?  How are you doing, Tony?  Everything all right here?  And the cock moves like this here, like I'm moving my hand. 
[03:37:00]  This is the future comedy.  He's got a cock puppet.  Next, I'll be shitting on the fucking floor because there's no respect for a great craft.  This is a fucking great craft.  I just did the 92nd Street fucking theater, man.  I wish you'd get a copy of that because it's something that you got to give back.  You care about a fucking great comedy to be a comic and get respect and get laughs at your fucking age, man.  That's dynamite.  Can I ask another question?  No.  One more question?  When did you become like Pat Coop? 
[03:37:30]  When did you decide?  When I went on the Tom Snyder show.  Is when you formed who we know and love today.  Well, no, I was making good money then.  But I was like, well, you know, he's an opening actress and that, an opening actress.  Nice guy.  Yeah, put him on the show.  He'll do 12, 15 minutes.  I was better than that.  And I was more than that.  And I finally said, it's about time I stood up with these fucking people.  And I did.  And I went on national television on Tom Snyder.  I think it was 1980.  And I told Tom Snyder, some of the ball breakers and some of the insults that these fucking people think they can take my dignity. 
[03:38:00]  Fuck comedy.  Fuck money.  Fuck everything.  Your dignity.  My father and mother couldn't take my fucking character or my dignity.  So I stood up to these fucking people.  And all of a sudden they go, you're ruined your career.  Who are some of these people?  Like who, I know it's figurative, but who's the people that you said fuck that?  Stephen Eadie.  Tony Bennett.  Tony Bennett treated you bad.  Well, Tony Bennett, in my opinion, he was always halfway in a fucking coma.  You couldn't talk to Tony Bennett.  I worked with him at the Diplomat years ago. 
[03:38:30]  He comes out of the elevator.  He goes, well, we're going to work together.  We're working now.  Where the fuck are you kidding me?  We're working now, Tony.  And I'm saying, what the fuck is wrong with these people?  I love that he's cursing out Tony Bennett.  These icons are his peers.  And he's like, Tony Bennett's a douchebag.  And what was Stephen Eadie's problem?  I turned around and did a deep nine on me.  I mean, it was Lola Fulana.  Give me a fucking break.  I went backstage to tell her what a wonderful act she did.  She said, tell him I'm sleeping.  You're standing up in front of me. 
[03:39:00]  What do you mean you fucking sleeping?  Fuck you too.  How's that great?  Oh, wow.  Lola Fulana.  Then she came on the week after and said I was jealous of her career.  What career?  Give me a fucking break.  That's true.  Lola Fulana was a bad bitch, but really.  Let's be honest.  Well, she had her time.  She had her time.  She did that right now.  She had big acts doing a favor opening for her.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Frankie Valli and the Seasons did it.  I mean, a lot of stars did it because they were trying to make her a big name star. 
[03:39:30]  Right, right.  They were trying to put her over.  Right.  I'm sorry?  You ever, what's the, I don't even know how to ask, what's the highest level of fame,  would you say nationally, that you've had?  What year?  What moment?  Do you ever had your moment?  I had a flow, which is a gift.  If any comic can get that.  I tell them, don't worry about stardom.  If you get a fucking flow, you'll be a millionaire.  In other words, continually out there and the people want to see you and want to hear you.  Get a flow.  Don't worry about series.  Don't worry about that.  Nice and easy because one day you're going to wake up, you're fucking old. 
[03:40:00]  And to do a series for five, six years, it drains you.  They don't, nah, I want to get a fucking series.  All of a sudden, they're going to be 82 like me.  And they ain't, they can't.  What about when they can't handle failure?  Or what about when they can't handle, I'm not a name no more.  I don't do the business no more.  It's fucking over.  The fucking door is closed, you sick bastard.  You're getting ready to fucking die.  Get laid down.  Put your hands across your balls and fucking die.  You had enough of this shit.  People paid money to see your asshole. 
[03:40:30]  So now it's over.  You're a fucking bore.  That's what you say.  Not you.  You're just talking to us.  I think he's talking to us.  I think he's talking to us.  Holy shit.  Wow, Pat.  How does he get this energy?  Do you ever get tired?  Do you wake up like this?  No.  Can I say something?  The average night for me, 10 o'clock, I'm in bed.  I get up about 7, 6.37, take a shower.  The minute that phone rings in my mind, I'm not.  Is he interrupting me again?  Is he interrupting me? 
[03:41:00]  I don't like black people.  Let's not cancel the 7.  7 P's.  Let's...  The man is trying...  He don't like black people anymore.  He really likes them to begin with.  The job on the side of the bed and he just...  I'm sorry, sir.  Sorry, Mr. Cooper.  But 10 o'clock at night, that's nice.  You don't have to be sorry.  I love you and I respect you.  What's the matter with you?  I met you at what's it when we did the college show together.  Down on 23rd in Lexington.  He don't remember.  But five people don't remember me shit.  He might get me confused with Flip Wilson. 
[03:41:30]  No.  And we did it.  Flip Wilson.  Oh, shit.  Oh, I'm on a show.  The devil made me do it.  How do you say it?  You don't remember that we made a little bit of a movie?  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  That's another ad-lib.  Yeah.  I didn't meet you.  I didn't meet you there.  I mean, we used to do...  I used to be on Tough Crowd every time he was on.  With Colin Quinn.  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  With Colin Quinn. 
[03:42:00]  And people go, people go, I don't want to do a show with Pat Cooper.  I go, just put me on.  I love Pat...  I don't...  Just let Pat Cooper go.  Why wouldn't anyone want to do a show with Pat?  Because this.  You just let him go.  Because this.  Everybody wants to get their joking.  They don't understand.  You sit there in the glory of Pat Cooper.  Just sit there.  All right.  Exactly.  Let me give it a scenario.  All right.  I'm over people's houses.  And I'm very nice.  And this guy cleansed around.  The guy's on.  And he goes, you know, he says, you don't give nobody a fucking chance to talk.  I says, you're right.  I didn't talk.  Nobody at the table said a fucking way.  We sat there.  The dog barked. 
[03:42:30]  That's what happened.  I said, all right, big mouths.  Say something.  You know what?  Because you're fucking boring.  That's your fucking problem.  You got no fucking life.  You're full of shit.  So do what you got to do.  Masturbate.  That's your big thrill.  And I never was invited to that house again.  I was going to say, you were a guest over this house.  Not a good thing to say, right.  I've never...  Have you...  You've been...  Not accused, but people have said you've burnt some bridges in your day.  No, no.  Not bridges.  How about buildings and everything?  I tell you, it's the best fucking thing I did. 
[03:43:00]  Scorched earth policy.  I should have done it earlier.  Yeah?  I should have done it earlier.  All of a sudden, the so-called stars went, I don't want to work.  I'm afraid.  What are you going to say?  Oh, you're afraid what I'm going to say?  What a fucking joke.  Because you're a bunch of pussy assholes.  And that's why they wouldn't want to work with you?  And they'd have you taken off the building?  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  I worked on my own.  That's simple.  That's fucked up.  I came a name on my own, and I did my own business.  I didn't need them.  Fuck them.  Yeah.  And I still will open for anybody, and I still know my place to be in an opening act.  So they don't have to tell me, oh, listen, do what, 22 minutes. 
[03:43:30]  Fuck you.  But they don't know.  See, when you go through life and look in the mirror so you know something, you did it all.  Where the fuck are you going?  And you thank God.  You dip the bread in the fucking sauce.  Not black people.  They dig it in the pong cone.  Or a cold car.  Yeah, we got it.  Vancouver is old as shit.  I've never even heard of this shit. 
[03:44:00]  You should write a book slang.  Old slang with Pacans.  This is some Jim Crow shit.  Yeah, look at the cone bowl.  My next book, I'm going to give it a name of it.  When you're born a dog, you can't die a cat.  That makes a lot of sense.  That makes a lot of sense, though.  It does, because it's about your life.  Yeah.  I got a my-page book.  Because all the people that said I changed.  They're full of shit.  Pat, did you do the-  When you're 70 years old, you don't change.  You're a prick.  You're going to die a prick.  You've always been this guy.  Yeah, fuck him.  Did you do the iTunes reading of your book?  No.  Sorry?  The reading of your book. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, it's coming out in Braille.  Get it?  No, he wants-  Punched the holes himself.  No, we want the iTunes version, where he's reading the book to us.  Where Pat Cooper's on tape.  Your tab, my fucking tab, at the Stage Deli, this fucking guy ain't like-  Let me rewind, man.  I'm going to read this.  This is from the book.  Do you got that?  Do you got like where we can hear you actually read the book?  We got it half done.  Oh, half done?  Yeah.  That's a very difficult thing for me to do.  I mean, this guy, Steve Garrett, is great at that.  Thank you.  Steve, he walked me through it because now you've got to talk about the book and get 
[03:45:00]  your voice over with that.  And the compliment is people who read my book said, you know, Pat, it sounds like you, which  is great.  I'm trying to get that on the fucking-  Yeah, because when you read something that somebody like you would have written, you hear  it in your voice.  Stop reading what I'm on, you sick bastard.  That's your book, though, Pat.  That's a good plug.  He's reading your book.  That's great.  Now he wants to read it.  Okay.  Now here's some people on the back that's saying you're, okay, ready?  And who, what do you think of?  Jerry Seinfeld.  He has, he's a comedian's comedian, I think.  Jerry Seinfeld. 
[03:45:30]  What do you think of Jerry?  I love Jerry.  He's a man who's had one of the great comedy shows of all time.  I love Jerry.  Can I tell you something?  I still look at the reruns of that show.  Yeah, it's hysterical.  Oh, fucking dynamite.  It's dynamite.  I'm one of his biggest fans, Jerry Lewis.  Well, Jerry, you know, waiting on line, you weren't even born to know, you know, I was  waiting on line to see some, to see Jerry and Dean Martin.  I sat through six, seven shows at the Paramount.  A few years later, Jerry's at my house having dinner.  You know, and you say to yourself, can you fucking believe I used to wait to see this 
[03:46:00]  guy and he's at my house now?  He loved me, hugged me.  He said something to my wife, God love you.  He says, put a tape recorder around this man's neck because all day long, you'll have your  pee in your pants.  He's naturally a funny, this is coming from another comic.  And what other comics say, you know, Pat, you're just, that's what you want.  You want your peers to do.  He's a comic, but why didn't none of these fucking guys cuff you and put you in that  spotlight, Pat?  Like, put you in their movies and put, I went, I made movies. 
[03:46:30]  Don't, don't, don't say put me in.  No, I know you, I know you made movies, Pat.  He's on your side, Pat.  Yeah, but I'm saying, like, you were, you're the guy of those guys.  Right.  They love you, but no, they.  That's a good question.  They didn't cuff you and go, put Pat in these fucking movies.  I will answer you.  All right.  I'm overbearing.  They don't want me in the fucking area.  Do you understand me?  They decided, I don't know what this guy's going to say.  He's too fucking much.  They want people to be under low key.  They don't want people, you know, directing the movie. 
[03:47:00]  No, I didn't direct the movie.  I am me.  And if I can't be me, what about scumbags are out there now getting a million and a  half a fucking week.  I never did that.  I'm a fucking mensch.  I'm a fucking friend.  I'm a good guy.  Fuck them.  How's that tell you?  I'm fuck them again.  You know, people think who the fuck they are because I cannot do what I do.  I got family.  I'm going to go fuck themselves.  I mean, what's the difference?  Because they're full of shit and they're not nice.  That's what you do.  That's what makes a fucking man.  You call it the way it is. 
[03:47:30]  I mean, give me a fucking break.  Are you ever soft spoken?  Yes, I am when I'm fucking sleeping.  And if you wake me up in the middle, I'll complete the sentence.  We continue with more of our tribute to Patrice O'Neal.  Club Soda Kenny.  I'd like to say that Patrice O'Neal was a great guy.  He's going to be missed.  I remember one time he asked me,  can I get a bottle of water and a cup of ice? 
[03:48:00]  I'll never forget that.  Our tribute to the life of Patrice O'Neal continues  with more of his legendary appearances on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's unstoppable.  After this.  Patrice O'Neal's new CD, Mr. P, will be released on February 7th, 2012.  But until then, you can pre-order it right now on iTunes and Amazon.com.  Here's an exclusive track titled, 
[03:48:30]  Hate People Touching Me, from the great Patrice O'Neal.  And I don't like people touching me.  I don't think anybody should touch a motherfucker that don't want to be touched.  I don't give a fuck.  Cop, everything.  And I'm not anti-cop.  I used to be when I was young, but not now.  I'm 41.  I own shit.  I like cops.  Cops are here for people that own shit.  I don't hate cops like I used to hate cops.  Because that's no one else to call when a nigga...  When you own shit, this is a young table. 
[03:49:00]  When you own own shit, you're like the cops.  Trust me.  When I was your holy brother.  26.  26?  Well, you're getting close.  What's your credit?  Credit good?  Credit's good?  Did you buy anything yet?  You own anything?  What do you own?  I own a car.  Nigga, that don't count.  You know what I meant, slick bastard.  But it's alright.  There's a lot of white people here.  Pick up yourself.  I own shit.  What do you own?  And the thing is, you didn't want a straight lie, so you said a car. 
[03:49:30]  And you know those white people sitting right here going, oh boy.  Congratulations, nigga.  You own a car.  Yes.  You work hard, yeah, man.  Sorry, man.  You don't see how much you like to fuck the cops when you just, when you live somewhere  and da-da-da.  But I don't like cops touching me.  I'd rather you just, you know, arrest me.  You know, I'm not against the cops.  So, look, you're under arrest.  Cool, let me put my hands. 
[03:50:00]  Just don't be checking me.  And I'm going to tell you why I don't like people checking me.  It's because of me.  Person, I'm a, um, you know, I'm getting old.  I'm getting, my mind is filthy, man.  And I'm not a terrible guy, but I know I have filthy, fucked up thoughts, man.  And, but I have filthy thoughts and my face be like this. 
[03:50:30]  I know how to keep dead serious, I'm not creepy face.  So, there's something about a woman's, uh, ass crack, man.  Like, if I see a woman's ass crack in public, that shit, that does something to me.  I'd be like, that is dirty.  So, you know, you get a girl bending over tying her shoes or some shit in her ass crack show.  I'd be like, damn, man. 
[03:51:00]  So, if I'm walking through a mall and I see that shit, my face be like, hmm.  But my mind be like, ass crack, nigga.  Oh, my face, I want my face in that ass.  I just want to slip my hand down there and, and, and, and I just want to, I just want to do that.  That's right, tie your shoes, nah. 
[03:51:30]  Just keep tying your motherfucking shoe.  But, my face be straight up, hmm, serious face.  But I'm like, delicious ass crack, that ain't mine.  That ain't my ass crack.  I'm a creep, nigga.  So, you don't think, so what you think?  There ain't no creepy ass police. 
[03:52:00]  You don't think there's gay police, lesbian police, creepy TSA motherfuckers.  Who got this face?  Protect the world face.  But they just like, yeah.  Is that a bomb under there?  That's your balls, huh?  You got a bomb in your balls?  But, I like balmy balls, big terrorist nuts.  But, but their face be.  Protect the world face.

Pre-order Patrice O'Neal's new CD, Mr. P, now on iTunes and Amazon.com. 
[03:53:00]  I got a story about how William Shatner and his wife almost made me cry.  Really?  Oh, shit.  You got all sensitive?  For real, yeah.  I love William Shatner.  Love me.  We love him.  He's going to be on again soon, man.  That's right.  He's really human, man.  Really a human guy.  Yeah, yeah.  And he was with his wife.  And after the show, I'm kind of in that.  I was in a fog the whole time because I didn't sleep.  So he's talking to me after he goes, Patrice.  Oh, fantastic.  All right?  I go, thank you, sir. 
[03:53:30]  He goes, yeah, very good.  Oh, it was, wow.  Yeah.  I was like, really liking the fact William Shatner's like intimate.  So they're talking.  And he goes, oh.  And I go, hey, man.  He says, did you have fun?  I said, I'm starting to have fun.  This was after.  I was like, I think I am.  I'm starting to relax.  I'm starting to relax.  And he goes, oh, okay.  Well, try to relax.  I said, I'm trying so hard, man.  But I can't stop being miserable.  I'm so trying not to be miserable.  He goes, honey, honey, didn't you think Patrice was great? 
[03:54:00]  She said, yeah.  He goes, honey, I'm just talking to Patrice about being miserable and trying to be happy.  And she goes, oh, you know, it's probably testosterone, right?  And she goes, you know, when guys start to lose their testosterone, because that's what makes them go, they get angry.  And I'm like, hmm.  She goes, but he shouldn't worry about that because he's young.  And he goes, but honey, Patrice has diabetes.  And that stops you from producing all the things you need in your body.  She goes, oh, that's probably why he's so terrible. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, my God.  This conversation with each other about how my body is breaking down.  It's breaking down.  And I have less testosterone and less madness.  But they weren't being cruel.  It was just, oh, he's sick and can't produce.  And she's like, yeah.  And so he gives me a hug.  You were great, young man.  Gets in their fucking limo.  And I'm welling up. 
[03:55:00]  You're like, motherfucker.  Because I'm realizing, oh, my body's making me angry.  My testosterone is gone.  Leave the poor man alone.  He's had enough.  And I'm like, I'm just.  Bones, Bones, check him out.  They had a 10-minute conversation.  Oh, my God.  Right in front of you.  About why I was just miserable.  It was human.  It wasn't.  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't trying to hurt me.  It was just like, take care of yourself. 
[03:55:30]  Hope I made your night better.  Liz is like, bye.  I'll bet they have that conversation with everybody.  They find something.  I'll bet they're like, oh, we got him pretty good.  Oh, they leave laughing.  They probably did that to Jeff Ross about something else.  Well, you're a Jew.  Jews aren't supposed to feel good after 30 minutes.  Jeff's crying.  My eyes was well enough.  I'm not lying.  Because it was like, I started going, is that it?  Because I'd be like, I'd be mad all the fucking time.  I'm like, is it my testosterone is going?  And she just was like, now you know how it feels about like menopause. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, damn.  She was saying.  Yeah, because she was like, that's what happens to women.  Why doesn't Bill Shatner talk to people who've known you for 15 years?  You're the exact same guy I met 15 years ago.  What do you think?  What do you think?  You were charming when we met and all of a sudden you got angry.  You've been terrible for a long time.  More of our favorite ONA appearances from the late Patrice O'Neal.  After this.  We continue with more of our tribute to Patrice O'Neal. 
[03:56:30]  You're hilariously awful.  Celebrating his life with some of his greatest moments on the O.P. and Anthony show.  You really got to eat healthy.  Well, yeah, because, you know, that fucking stupid diabetes.  But it's like, you know, like people say, you know, 40 is the new 30.  No, it ain't.  40 is exactly what it is.  40.  Father time don't bullshit.  No.  Father time doesn't bullshit.  When you turn 40, your body, you can do whatever you fucking want.  You fucking.  It starts the toboggan ride down the hill. 
[03:57:00]  You've used up all that time dragging that toboggan up the hill with all your youth and  strength and energy.  And now get on for the ride down.  And life is half over.  And the half that is left is the shitty half.  Let's be honest with each other.  40 to 80 is not a fucking picnic.  I just had a birthday, right?  I'm like, yeah.  People are like, happy birthday.  I go, don't remind me.  Like, yeah, I turned 41.  I'm like, you know what?  I'm already 42 right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You understand how fast life is going? 
[03:57:30]  It goes faster once you get older.  I'm dying.  You're just dying.  You're rotting.  At 20, you're just like, yeah.  You know what I was thinking the other day?  How long would it take?  Okay.  If I, if I, how many people would know you were dead?  Like, how long would it take for someone to be concerned that you were dead in days or  weeks or whatever?  However, with, what, but without, without news.  So, so, and then how many people, cause I know for, I mean, if you died in your house 
[03:58:00]  by yourself, you'll be dead forever before I go.  Like without news, I would never know you were dead.  You wouldn't know.  Someone would have to say something.  My mother, maybe after a while and my girl, that's it.  I'll be decomposed in my fucking house.  You'd be one of those fucking, they found a month later.  They would send it cause my fucking Chinese neighbor would send somebody out from the  smell.  She would call the police cause she's like, this fat nigga stinks.  I love your obsession with Asian people. 
[03:58:30]  I can't get enough of it.  I almost want to beg you to tell your story again.  I won't do it to you.  Right.  I won't do it to you.  Fucking Patrice.  It would, it would just be.  Someone send some of the upstairs.  It stink.  It stink up there.  But I'm just thinking like, that's what I think about now.  And then I enjoy, here's what I enjoy.  Not to be disgusting, but it's just, I'm just sharing.  I enjoy a good shit now.  I've never cared. 
[03:59:00]  I just enjoy a fulfilling empty shit like that.  Like it, it got out and it's shaped like a colon.  You were full.  Now you're not.  Tapered at both ends.  I'm obsessed with taking a good shit now.  Cause I just, that's where you end up.  I'm a fucking, just a curmudgeon.  No friends.  No fucking.  I'm happy about shits.  I'm going to stop wearing those. 
[03:59:30]  I'm worried about falling and not getting up.  You gotta need a life call.  I need a life call.  Jesus.  I don't know, man.  I suck.  I, I, I hate the commercials where there's a old man and old woman.  They're fucking, you know, at least in their seventies and, and, and they're doing their canoeing  or something and they look at the camera and they're like, these are the best years of  our lives.  And you just look like you're so full of fucking shit. 
[04:00:00]  You diaper wear.  And it's for a diaper.  It's for fucking like bladder control shit.  These are the best years of my life and I'm enjoying them.  Right.  It's like, fuck you.  You were at Woodstock, you idiot.  Yeah.  How about when you were fucking splayed open in the backseat of a fucking, a rumble seat  and a car just getting plowed by some dick was fucking by Fonzie when you had the greatest  dick of all time.  Yeah.  There's what you want.  And the pussy was good.  Oh, and a pussy was tight.  Like a fucking, like a little neck clam.  Now you see these two old people. 
[04:00:30]  Yeah.  Well, we're looking at two old people sitting there getting dialysis or something.  Now, let me ask you if they're together forever, like meaning who hates more, who hates  who more.  I mean, if, if you're together forever, yeah, since you were young and good.  Looking, does her face and his face look exactly like it does to us?  Right, right, right.  Like how they just look like two old farts?  Because if you look at someone every day, you don't notice they're changing.  Is she as ugly to him? 
[04:01:00]  Or is that the same beautiful shit bag?  Or does she, she looked like the same woman that was waiting for him when he got off the  boat from Europe?  Is she, when he dipped her in Times Square and gave her a kiss?  Oh, with her rubber face and her fucking giant newborn fucking horse knuckles.  They look like newborn horse knees.  Her big arthritic fucking knuckles looks like thoroughbred fucking joints.  How come father time? 
[04:01:30]  How come father time couldn't just do this?  You're going to be healthy, healthy, healthy, healthy, healthy, beautiful, then die.  Like, it is pretty twisted.  You just go, you're going to die in 80 years.  You're going to expire like a battery.  As opposed to regress.  What year do you think your body starts dying?  It's the second you come out of the fucking world.  I don't know about that.  Wait, yes.  Hold on. 
[04:02:00]  You're decomposing.  No, because having a son, I don't believe that anymore.  Because if he gets a cut or something, it heals within hours.  It's creepy.  Yeah, but do you...  So when does your body, like, make that turn?  No, I would say instantly.  Instantly, through cell regeneration, you're using up your resources.  No, no, no, I see what you're growing.  I know what he's trying to say.  No, I think you actually...  He's saying there's a...  You're being literal.  Literal, okay.  He's saying when do you start to regress?  Do you start... 
[04:02:30]  No, 40.  I would say 45.  I think there's...  I would say 40.  Do you see...  Anywhere between 40.  Hold on, hold on.  I think there's a...  When you're born, you're developing and...  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And maturing.  Meaning...  And then it's like...  There's got to be an age where the human being is perfect.  There's a click up.  It's a roller coaster.  It's perfectly made.  Everything is great.  The skin looks good.  Your bone structure.  Your fucking muscles.  And then when...  22 years old.  You think?  22 is a great age. 
[04:03:00]  I wonder if there's a real answer to this.  The click up?  The flying down is 40.  30 is the...  Click, click.  Is that...  It's the click, click, click, click.  The peak at the top.  And you stand in.  You survey the greatness of 30.  And then 40 is...  It's not...  It's fucking pee.  It's the obvious...  You got to go to the bathroom.  Four times a fucking night.  Because the obvious shit is like your skin starts sagging a little bit.  The gray hair starts coming in.  That's what I'm talking about. 
[04:03:30]  That's how you see this?  Gotcha.  A little bit.  It's fucking...  It's 40.  Yeah, you got a little bit up front.  Right.  When did you have to start going to get...  My touch-ups for television?  How old were you when things were happening bad up there?  Oh, God.  Well, the good thing was I had a nice, slow fucking thinning of my hair.  It was over the course of many years.  And you had a thick mane, right?  I had crazy, afro-fucking hair.  Dude, he...  But then I started noticing, like, all right, let's get a little thin.  And when I went out without a hat the other night, he's got a full head of hair now. 
[04:04:00]  I see him on Joey Bayar.  It's kind of creepy.  He's looking good, but...  He's kind of creepy.  Without the help of money and science...  Without $12,000?  Yes.  What...  Where...  Oh, I would be fucking well-received on the side.  I'd probably have a Phil Collins up front, and I'd have a George Costanza in the back.  How old are you, Danny?  I'll be 30 in a few weeks.  You'll be 30.  So you started going early.  You know what?  It's been...  It's just been a slow decline.  A slow decline?  Yeah. 
[04:04:30]  Like, you know, you notice...  You notice...  You notice things are changing, like, you know, for me, I don't know, 10 years ago,  like, I noticed, like, there's a little something going on, and it just...  What is that?  Now, how about your body?  Very slow.  Do you feel as good as you do when you was 20?  No, but that's my own fault, because I don't do anything.  I feel like things change for me when I turn 30.  30 was...  Yeah.  30 was changing?  I just felt like I couldn't, like, do a lot of the shit I used to do.  That was the prime of my life.  Health-wise, 30.  From 30 to...  I think it was psychological, though. 
[04:05:00]  45 was awful for me.  It was just a complete decline.  From 35 to 45, I would say, awful, because I did not take care of...  Yeah, look at that.  Isn't that wonderful?  That's a shadow part of the hair, mind you, to the right.  That picture makes me sick.  Isn't it terrible?  Look at me.  I'm an emaciated...  I fucking hate you in this picture.  ...wiped, trash, fucking...  Why are you emaciated?  Drugs?  You know what?  You look like your attitude now.  Like, you don't look...  I think...  Oh, you are perfect.  If you look like that, and you were you, I would never come in here. 
[04:05:30]  You are perfect.  That is exactly it.  You're a fucking piece of gunk.  Just a piece of shit.  I fucking hate your guts.  I know.  Yeah.  I don't fucking fault you in the least, Patrice.  You know what I got on right there, Opie?  A WBAB graffiti sweatshirt.  Oh, wow.  Look at the picture of Bob Buckman drawn on the bottom.  Wow, look at that.  Look, Ralph Titora.  I fucking hate you in this picture.  Yeah, that was...  Right now, you look like a man who... 
[04:06:00]  Like, your ideas seem to be well-formed, and I can respect them.  I tried.  This piece of shit.  You're not allowed to have an opinion.  You fucking piece of garbage.  That shit.  Did he look like that when you worked together?  What, Opie?  I was at the tail end.  Yeah, for the most part.  That was the tail end of looking like that.  I bet Anthony had a massive afro.  Tail end of looking like that when we got the job in Boston.  Wild motherfucking hair.  That was it.  Put in a ponytail for about 10.  Were you a wild red guy, Vin?  Yeah, yeah. 
[04:06:30]  Really?  Yeah, that's what's so weird about it.  I craved knowledge and cocaine.  I would just go la, la, la, la at this person that had any knowledge.  I would go, go fuck yourself.  I swear, I used to cut lines on encyclopedias.  That was the duality of me.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  I fucking hate that picture.  That is every white trash Long Island motherfucker right there.  I was a dime a dozen walking around in Long Island.  I can't believe that picture. 
[04:07:00]  Isn't that sick?  That's right.  Yeah.  I weighed 130 pounds.  Just a sickly man.  Little thin fucking.  Long arms.  Long gangly arms.  Big fucking afro head.  How old were you there?  That bad, my first, it was like fucking play school's my first mustache.  That looked 20s.  How old were you?  Oh yeah, I was about 22, 23 there.  And you was 22 in that picture?  Yeah, probably.  You were dying early.  I wasn't taking very good care of myself.  You was in decline, man.  I wasn't taking very good care of myself. 
[04:07:30]  Fuck me, you were haggard.  Yeah.  Let me see this.  That was a while ago.  I can't believe that picture.  You were 22 in that picture?  22, at the most, 23.  Just wanting to be in a fucking session band?  I'm going to fucking be, I was going to be the rock star.  What was your dreams?  What was your dreams in that?  Rock star.  Dreams.  I was fucking rock star.  Rock star mode.  I was lead singer of Rotgut, motherfucker.  I was going to take over the world.  What do you think that guy is doing now?  I mean, who is that guy?  That is a wax image of fucking, you dumb fucks.  That's a bad wax Bob Hope. 
[04:08:00]  No.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yes, it is.  That's in some kind of a wax museum.  It doesn't look like Bob Hope.  Of course, it was a shitty wax museum.  I see where it's waxing.  It's like on the road to fucking Zanzibar or some shit.  Wow.  Look at you, man.  Yeah.  You make me sick.  That's terrible.  You know what?  Terrible.  Fucking five packs of Marlboro Reds a day.  He just...  So you're way better than that.  Now, what would you...  If you could go back to that guy, what would you tell him? 
[04:08:30]  One thing you would just tell him.  After I pinned him down and shaved his fucking head, I would tell him, knock it off.  You're not cool.  You look like an idiot.  No, to help you...  To help you from letting that person become the one you are now.  You mean idealistically?  You just go back and you fucking help.  But no, no, no.  Because that person...  I tell myself...  That person fucking shaped what you are.  Right.  Even though you like what you are. 
[04:09:00]  But would...  There would be no advice you could give him?  I would give advice.  I would say, quit smoking and watch your cholesterol.  That's about it.  It would be helpful.  That's pretty much what I would say right there.  Because I'm going to tell you, if you watch your cholesterol...  Yeah.  Let me tell you yourself.  You're going to be fucking so many young bitches.  You're going to love that shit.  And exercise.  Don't wait until you're fucking 45 to start exercising, motherfucker.  Unbelievable.  All right, listen, we got the Santa that got fired. 
[04:09:30]  Oh, yeah, some people are really...  And no matter what you do, never marry a bitch named Jennifer.  Oh, yeah, you forgot that part.  I don't care what you're thinking when you're fucking...  Run!  Run!  I don't care how it feels.  Run!  I don't care what anyone says.  Don't ever marry her.  Fuck.  Yeah, you forgot the obvious.  Yeah.  And then I'd give him a picture of my house right now and go, 
[04:10:00]  Now, listen to my advice in here.  Just take that witch.  It's going to be like old Biff telling young Biff in the car.  Yeah.  Listen to me, butthead.  Butthead.  Take this book.  It's driving my Mustang.  Get out of my Mustang, you!  How the fuck do you know how to start my car?  That's Back to the Future.  Yeah.  Jesus, man.  Young Biff and old Biff.  I guess you haven't listened to the show in a while.  Take it out of your sight. 
[04:10:30]  Always keep this on you here like this.  Oh, that was the gambling book.  Yeah, with the fucking...  I've seen it, but I can't quote from that fucking movie.  The sports almanac he gives them and fucking...  Luckiest man in the world at the track with his picture.  Damn.  Young Ant takes one of the poker chips back with him.  He sees it like change as something happened in the future.  See me with a giant check at the fucking...  Borgata.  Hey, here I am.  Fuck me, man.  Ah, shit, yeah. 
[04:11:00]  We really are fucking preoccupied, though, with the whole time thing.  Yeah, because I'm just like...  We're constantly...  I mean, just as human beings, we really are.  Some more than others, but I even think the ones that come across like they're not are.  When I hear 62-year-old people die, I go, oh, man.  You're stuck doing some math.  At 20, you go, what difference does it make?  You're ready to die anyway, you old piece of shit.  Now I'm like, oh, no.  I used to think how long it would take.  Like, and I'm talking when I was probably when I was like 10 years old. 
[04:11:30]  I would think how long it was going to be till I was 40.  And it's like, oh, my God.  And I would sit there going like, I have to go through like 1970.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  And these are all years.  I know how long a year is.  And I'm counting it off like that.  And it's like, God, that'll be forever.  And then all of a sudden you're there.  This is the most fucked up thing about age.  You don't change.  You just get older. 
[04:12:00]  You think you do.  At 20, right, you're just young and delicious.  But at 40, at 40, there's guys in high school I still hate with the same passion.  Like, you would think you get mature and blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, you'd think something changes.  You fucking, you are the same person you was at 20.  Except for now you're fucking 40.  Yes.  You got the same likes and dislikes. 
[04:12:30]  And a few little incidental things change.  Like, oh, I like Brussels sprouts now.  But other than that, you're the same motherfucker.  Your laugh doesn't change.  Like, you don't start laughing like, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, jocularity, jocularity.  Yeah, you're like, you don't become a man.  Like, I still look at men and then go, fuck, he's a man.  I'm 40.  I want somebody to praise me when I fill my gas tank. 
[04:13:00]  Like, if I fill my gas tank, I go, somebody should just, why don't nobody just say how responsible I am?  Look at you with a full gas tank.  You've made it, Patrice O'Neal.  Fucking, when am I going to feel like a man?  I just paid my bills this month.  You never will.  Someone fucking say, cool.  Say, wow, look at you.  You never will.  We continue with more of our tribute to Patrice O'Neal.  Hey, it's Jim Norton.  And they asked me last week to talk about Patrice for the special, and I didn't. 
[04:13:30]  It was just too sad.  I didn't know what to say.  What memories do you share?  I have so many memories of him.  I mean, you know, for years and years and years.  One that stands out for me, and I've told it on O&A before, is we've gone to Brazil three times to get hookers together.  And one time, he and I, we were taking 100 milligram Viagras every night. 
[04:14:00]  We would just take them, me, him, Keith Robinson, too.  And we would just go to the whorehouse called the Monte Carlo, and we would just fuck prostitutes.  And I think none of us would come until the last one, because if you came, your night was over.  And I remember the way the Monte Carlo worked is you'd go down, you'd change into a robe, and you would put your clothes in a locker.  And then you take the elevator up in your slippers, in your white robe, and that's where there's photos of Patrice and I in our white robes in this whorehouse.  And you stand in this bar area, and these beautiful Brazilian hookers come over, and you can talk to them, make out with them at the bar. 
[04:14:30]  It's surreal.  So one time, Patrice and I are there, and I have a 100 milligram Viagra heart on, and it's just, you can't see my dick, but it's just tenting.  The front of my robe is tenting out, and Patrice and I are just looking at this erection bulge in my robe, and we're howling like five-year-olds.  We're just giggling, because what we were doing, the wrongness of what we were doing was so crystal clear by my erection. 
[04:15:00]  We just couldn't believe that we had flown to a third-world country strictly to get prostitutes.  And that's a very, very vivid memory and a very fun moment I had with him.  And I remember every time we were there, him lugging up this, there's a story in one of my books called Dr. Dildo,  because Patrice would take a glass bag of dildos with him to try to make these girls come.  And so I can remember vividly hearing the clanking glass bag of dildos as he would go up in the elevator. 
[04:15:30]  Like, he would have to go, when he would get a girl, because he wouldn't bring the dildos up from the locker into the bar area,  he would leave them in the locker.  So he would always have to go all the way down to the locker, get his glass dildo bag,  and then go up, get the girl, then go to the room, and then go back down and put his dildos away.  It was a fucking process.  Whenever we would check into the Monte Carlo, because you'd check in for the night, like, you know, a few hours.  You'd go there for four or five hours.  And just the, we would spend, I think we'd spend a week or ten days there each time we went, at least a week. 
[04:16:00]  So those are some of my favorite memories of him, was my time from just being on vacation with him,  and Bobby and Keith, and just, and the laughs we had.  But there's too many over the years.  Like, you know, it's hard to talk about, because you don't want to think specifically.  It's still kind of hard to believe, like, weird moments, like, just kind of make it go, like, oh my God, he's dead.  Like, it's really, really hard to wrap your head around that you're not going to see this person again. 
[04:16:30]  So I don't mean to ramble, and I wanted to do the tribute, but, you know, I just, I don't know what to say.  You know, it's just, it's terrible.  And I have so many amazing memories of him.  Thanks.  And I'll take with me the memory  To be my sunshine after the rain 
[04:17:00]  It's so hard to say goodbye  To yesterday  Thank you for listening to our tribute to the life of Patrice O'Neill.  Patrice's special, Elephant in the Room, is available now for download and on DVD.  You can show your support for his family by purchasing the special today.
