<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy engaging in graphic sexual banter.  The main focus quickly shifted to the arrest of former radio host Dave Herman for allegedly soliciting sex with a seven-year-old girl in the Virgin Islands.  The hosts read from news articles detailing the charges and Herman's statements, recounting their past interactions with him, including a lawsuit he filed against them and CBS Radio following a segment where his ex-wife, Libby, criticized him on-air. They detailed Herman's attempts, along with other WNEW personalities, to sabotage their careers, implicating a co-worker, Mark, in secretly recording them at WNEW to potentially aid the lawsuit.  The discussion covered the legal aspects of Herman's case, his YouTube channel, and listener reactions online.  Interspersed with the Herman discussion were segments on a malfunctioning furnace and Jimmy’s upcoming comedy gigs.  The show also previewed appearances by Lexi Love, Bobo, and Bobby Slayton, with a mention of Dennis Falcone as a potential guest familiar with Herman.

The show continued with a brief mention of Ira's absence due to Jay Thomas's neck surgery, leading to a tangent about John Spano and his failed attempt to buy the New York Islanders, referencing an ESPN 30 for 30 documentary, followed by speculation on George Steinbrenner's Yankees acquisition. This transitioned into a discussion about a SiriusXM Halloween channel and popular Halloween songs like "Monster Mash" and "Dead Man's Party."  The conversation returned to Dave Herman, focusing on a darkly humorous fictional narrative about a stuffed animal he allegedly had with him during his arrest, and debated appropriate sentencing lengths for such crimes, comparing them to "Catch a Predator" cases.  A significant portion was devoted to critiquing the radio duo Scott and Todd, whose work the hosts deemed "horrible" and "cornball," playing clips of their song parodies and phone scams while offering commentary and impersonations.  They mentioned receiving a "Jocktober" award.  Larry King briefly called in to discuss Herman's arrest.  The hosts also discussed their upcoming Halloween party and their opinions on radio.  Technical difficulties briefly interrupted the broadcast.

The next segment began with a discussion of Pearl Jam, Eddie Vedder's political statements, and concert ticket prices, transitioning to a discussion about commercials and their absence from the show.  Lexi Love's presence outside the studio was announced, followed by comments about a subdued Bobo.  A rapid-fire segment of crude jokes about numerous sponsors occurred, before returning to the Dave Herman arrest and their past legal battle with him, including the incident with his ex-wife.  Jim Norton was mentioned and plugged his upcoming stand-up shows, including material about Herman.  Norton shared anecdotes about filming *Louie*, a needle injection incident resulting in priapism, and his yearly joke about attacking Scott Shannon.  The hosts discussed the "Jocktober" bit and Terry Clifford, sharing a bizarre Bed Bath & Beyond encounter and their receipt of hate mail.  Further discussion about Norton’s stand-up and appearances on other shows occurred before his farewell.

The show then featured a staged sponge bath given by Lexi Love to Bobo, culminating in a lengthy, sexually suggestive scene involving Bobo's nudity, various props, and numerous off-color jokes.

The next segment involved Bobo, Lexi Love, and Bobby Slayton. The segment started with a discussion about Bobo sleeping with a condom on, followed by a recap of Lexi Love's sponge bath.  The conversation shifted to Slayton’s arrival, his 15-year absence, and an experience buying cupcakes.  The discussion moved to allergies, with Lexi Love detailing her gluten intolerance.  Slayton recounted stories from his career, including his experience on a Tom Arnold sitcom with his then-nine-year-old daughter who later joined GRL (formerly the Pussycat Dolls).  The conversation included numerous crude jokes and sexually suggestive comments focusing on Bobo's experience with Lexi Love.  He shared anecdotes about encounters with celebrities, his past with Patrice O'Neal, and his feelings about the nickname "The Pitbull of Comedy." He detailed a near-miss opening for the Rolling Stones, a backstage encounter with a porn star, and opening for the Stranglers.  The segment concluded with more sexually charged banter.

The final segment included Slayton recounting a disastrous experience hosting the Bay Area Music Awards, his confrontation with Journey, and his removal from the event by Bill Graham.  Bobo participated in humorous exchanges.  Nicole from the morning mashup announced her pregnancy, leading to discussions about pregnancy, childbirth, foot fetishes, Bobo's penis size, and navigating profanity levels on different radio shows.  Finally, the show included a plug for Russell Peters' Netflix special, "Notorious."

Let's get this show on the road.  Yeah!  Good morning everyone.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh my goodness gracious.  Hi everybody.  Friday!  It certainly is.  I'm freezing.  I think I'm chilled to the bone because my furnace isn't working at my house. 
[00:02:30]  Why not?  Well, it's the old problem.  I got this copper line, right?  It goes from the oil tank.  And then it tees off.  A little tee fitting.  Right.  And it goes to the water heater and the oil furnace.  Right.  You know, the oil-fired furnace.  Sure.  The water heater's working, but the tee fitting gets all cloggy.  Right.  It gets a little clogged up.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, when that happens...  I don't care.  I don't care.  My chokes don't go over. 
[00:03:00]  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  What were you saying?  Well, that isn't the brunt of the story.  Oh.  Yeah.  I wouldn't care about fucking tee fittings either.  Sure, sure.  But, uh, suffice to say, it wasn't working, and the house is getting a little cold.  Right.  So I call up the oil company, and they say, all right, we'll send someone over between  8 p.m. and 11 p.m.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Yeah.  Um, by midnight, I'm like, I gotta go to sleep.  It's fucking midnight. 
[00:03:30]  So I go to sleep.  I hear the doorbell ring.  At what time?  Exactly.  It is 10 minutes to 4 in the morning.  Oh.  3.50.  10 to 4.  The fucking bell rings.  Wait, a mere couple hours ago.  Yes.  What?  I fucking, I punch up my cam, my front door cam on my phone.  Pointing your cannons.  Yes, exactly.  At the front door.  I have sleepies I can barely see, and there's the fucking oil guy. 
[00:04:00]  At 3.50 in the morning?  At 10 minutes to 4 a.m.  No.  Ringing my bell like I'm just gonna be like, oh, hi, come on in.  No.  I didn't even answer.  I was just like, I'm fucking, I gotta sleep.  You sure it wasn't like the, the feds or something?  No, I saw it.  Taking a little look-see?  Nah, it was, I'm not Dave Herman.  It was, uh.  You're more repulsive.  I fucking, uh.  Wow.  So now I gotta call him later and be like, are you shitting me?  What's that about? 
[00:04:30]  I don't know.  But to 8 and 11 was one thing.  And even, you know, up until midnight, uh, I would have been fine with.  But what do they expect?  You're just gonna get out of bed?  Exactly.  No one's up at that, uh, that hour.  How do you even show up at that hour instead of just calling your home base and going,  look, I wasn't able to make it, call this guy up and tell him tomorrow.  Maybe if there was a real, real issue and it was really, really cold.  If it was, yeah.  In the middle of winter and maybe there was an ice storm and it took everybody out.  Right, right.  You know, you gotta adjust everything.  But, wow, I've never heard of that before in my life. 
[00:05:00]  I never did either.  I was fucking flabbergasted.  So they're gonna get a nice little phone call from me.  But, uh, it was so fucking cold.  From me!  I get up and especially upstairs, the bedroom, like, you don't have that.  Insulation of the rest of the house.  Yeah.  And my bedroom's cut over my garage.  Yeah.  So.  Doesn't it make for a good sleeping night?  It really does, but at some point.  No, we got some good sleeping weather.  At some point, you gotta get up, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, and that's a fucking bitch.  Oh, boy, will they hear it from me.  Isn't it worse than having to piss when it's that cold?  You know, like, stiff light to the bathroom, your fucking bag's all shriveled? 
[00:05:30]  I just pissed the bed.  It's warm for a few minutes.  So, uh, yesterday, we gotta get right into this, because we have a really, really busy show today.  Oh, boy.  And Jimmy's leaving early today.  So we gotta, we gotta jump right into the story of the day.  So, yesterday, I'm walking around, and Anthony, uh, texts me.  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, he writes something like, uh, I wanna, what was your text yesterday?  Was it about me?  Oh, no.  Was it about one of my characters?  Oh.  About giving me a raise? 
[00:06:00]  That Jim deserves a little more money.  What do you say?  What do you say?  Let's go to bat for the fella.  Oh.  You text me, you're right.  You see the Dave Herman story.  Holy crap, that twisted, sick fuck.  Yeah.  So I'm thinking, what could, what could he have possibly done that, has Anthony texted  me?  And then I'm thinking, okay, it's gotta be some underage shit.  So then I'm thinking, you know, all right, what, the typical, you know, teenage girl scenario?  Oh, boy.  He's a guy around 77, I think.  Oh, jeez.  So I click on the story you sent me, and, uh, I told you this morning, I told everyone 
[00:06:30]  around here this morning, it's probably the worst thing I've ever read in a newspaper.  It is such a sick...  And we've read some horrific shit over the years.  Yeah.  Even the 9-11 stuff, which was horrific to read about.  This, like, shows the way he, um...  Uh-oh!  What happened?  Lights went out?  Our dads are saying hi again.  Oh, man.  What's up, pups?  Love you, miss you, brother.  I'm not a faggot. 
[00:07:00]  The lights went out, so...  Remember the time...  You should say that every time lights go out.  Even if you flick the lights.  Whoa, look at this.  Wait, why lights out over at Fox?  So weird.  What's the lights out thing?  What is this?  When this stuff is over, we're gonna be looking back at this and being like, dang.  That was some crazy stuff.  Is it an anniversary of a blackout or something?  Why, why we got some lights out?  I don't know.  Remember the time me and Ann were talking about our dead fathers and the lights went out? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  So weird.  That was so creepy.  Because you looked up at the lights and said, like, almost as if taunting the spirits.  Yeah.  If you're up there looking at me right now, why don't you send me a sign and just flick  on the lights.  Yeah, it was really a strange thing.  Very strange.  And people around here swore they weren't fucking with us.  Anyway, so I read this thing and I thought to myself immediately, I don't think I've ever  read anything more horrific in a newspaper in my life.  Dave Herman, for the people that don't know, because we got a lot of newer listeners over 
[00:08:00]  the Dave Herman rock and roll boarding show.  Wow.  Yeah, that was...  You might want to drop that invitation.  I want to drop that impression.  It's a great show.  Oh, boy.  That impression.  So, Dave Herman, when we came to New York from Boston after we got fired, we got hired  at WNEW.  The problem was they had all these legend...  I have to say legendary like this.  Quotations.  Air quotes.  I don't respect most of those guys whatsoever and never did, because I didn't think it 
[00:08:30]  was that special to fucking talk between the music.  Yeah.  I never thought that was special.  Even when I was doing it, I'm like, God, this is fucking easy.  My friends can do this.  This isn't special.  Yeah.  Gives a fuck.  Anyway, legendary, in quotes, rock jock Dave Herman was there with Scott Muni and Carol  Miller and Dennis Elsys and Pete Fornatel.  Pete Fornatel.  And what's his name?  He works here. 
[00:09:00]  What?  Pat St. John.  Oh, Pat St. John, who was actually cool to us.  I like Pat.  Pat wasn't that bad to us.  That's a good guy.  Carol Miller was kind of schizo to us.  Well, to everybody from what I've heard.  Sure.  Uh, and then Scott Muni was a rock star.  Scott ruled.  He was one of those guys that I did respect.  Yeah, yeah.  He was pretty much around when the Beatles, uh, came to America.  He was actually in it right when, uh, all that good shit was going on.  And one reason why I do respect them was because he understood change and he embraced us and  he was very cool to us.  The rest of these scumbags were not. 
[00:09:30]  Uh-huh.  The rest of them were not.  They were pieces of shit, every single one of them.  And wanted me and Anthony to fail so badly and made it really, really hard for us.  Yeah.  Uh, including, you know, we got to tell the stories again.  They would get hate faxes.  Well, this would, thank God this was before Twitter.  Jesus.  We got hate, you know, we go back to the days of hate faxes.  Yeah, hate faxes.  Fuck the Twitter voice and the haters on Twitter.  So, like, change was in the air and these jocks were trying to hold on. 
[00:10:00]  They knew we represented change at the time.  So, when they were doing their air shifts, they would get all these hate faxes about Opie and Anthony.  They suck, blah, blah, blah, all this shit.  And they would hang them up around the station.  Yeah.  And in the studio, making sure we saw it.  Yep.  More passive-aggressive assholes, by the way, because none of them ever confronted us.  The only one that did, and I respect her a tiny bit for doing it, was Carol Miller.  Carol Miller.  At least she had the balls to come face-to-face with us with the shit.  It's all about the music here at W-D-W. 
[00:10:30]  W-D-W.  W-D-W.  Yeah.  Can we play the, I don't even know if it holds up.  E-Rock, find the Carol Miller.  Oh, God.  The lady that wants to talk to Carol Miller, and we gave her the runaround.  I don't even know if it works.  Is there a UFC guy named Dave Herman?  Yep.  Yeah.  Oh, that poor bastard.  The guy from Office Space.  Right.  Well, those guys are going to have to change their names, because...  Oh, that guy.  Yeah, his name is Dave Herman.  Michael Bolton's name is Dave Herman? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  That poor bastard.  So, hate faxes, and it was so uncomfortable.  Yeah.  And the mistake that CBS Radio made at the time, they wanted to make this change, and me and  Ant were going to be the anchors of the whole thing.  Yeah.  They let these guys stick around way too long.  Oh, yeah.  And remember, they got rid of them one by one.  It was so long, because we heard about it, like it was their contracts and this, and they  couldn't just clean house in there. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  It took forever.  And Gary Wall, God bless him, because he believed in us, and he was all for the change, and  he was very excited we came to AEW.  He was the program director that was friends with Jimmy Kimmel.  And remember the meeting where everyone was in the conference room, and he points out  that we're the future of the radio station in front of all these guys?  I'm like, why are you doing this?  I know.  You're just making more hatred.  You're just making it worse for us.  So then I guess, Dave, I don't remember how long Dave Herman lasted.  I mean, our paths crossed over there at AEW for less than a year, I would say, right? 
[00:12:00]  Maybe six months.  He ended in 98, right?  We came in in 98.  Yeah, that's when he said he ended.  In 98?  Yeah.  So there was like...  Yeah, it was...  Oh, the lights are back on.  So we...  Dave Herman's wife called us one day on the air.  We didn't ask for it.  She called, because she was going through some kind of divorce or something.  Yeah.  I got to get my facts right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you don't know this shit?  I know the story.  I didn't realize that that was this guy.  Oh, that's him.  Oh, yeah.  I know the story.  Oh, yeah.  So her name was... 
[00:12:30]  I don't even know if she's alive or anything, but her name's Libby.  Libby Herman.  She's in the paper today.  Oh, yeah?  And she called us, because she knew how much we didn't like any of these guys, and was  saying all sorts of shit about Dave Herman.  And we were pretty green back then, but we were smart enough to go, whoa, that famous  shit.  Like, we don't know what the fuck's up here, but you're saying this.  And she was calling him a deadbeat dad, and they were going through a separation or a  divorce, and she had a lot of things to say about this guy. 
[00:13:00]  And she was having a yard sale, allegedly.  I don't know if she ever did, officially.  And she was putting all of Dave Herman's legendary rock shit on the front lawn, so we encouraged  our listeners to go there and pick up some memorabilia.  Yeah, and she was describing, like, what she had.  Right.  Remember?  She was on the phone, and she was like, I got a fucking jacket.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  The WWE.  That was fucking Dave Herman.  I forgot about that part. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So then you fast forward, and we're named in a lawsuit.  Dave Herman sues us.  For $10 million.  For $10 million bucks.  He sued us and CBS.  Yeah.  He got us for false and defamatory statements about him.  and what makes this even more interesting  a guy we thought we were friends with  and we thought liked us  it was part of the old regime  so we should have known  but he survived way longer than anyone else  he was some kind of engineer or production guy 
[00:14:00]  the guy works here at SiriusXM by the way  he's a big fucking piece of shit too  he was secretly taping me and Anthony  because these microphones  when we're not broadcasting  you can still tape whatever the fuck's going on in the studio  trying to find some fuel  so Dave could use it in his lawsuit  has he ever admitted that to you or no?  it came out in the case  no but since you've seen him here  oh fuck no  he avoids  he'll barely make eye contact  if we're kind of in  unfortunately in the same part of the building 
[00:14:30]  but he avoids us at all costs  to the point I'm not even sure if he works here anymore  because I haven't seen him in a while  he's a fucking piece of shit  he's a little fucking rat  he was basically wiretapping me and Anthony  he was double dating  with Dave  yeah no shit  if they were double dating  and his name's Mark  I have no problem saying his fucking first name  Mark we all know  so he was taping us at NEW  trying to get some shit  passing it on to  I don't know 
[00:15:00]  at least Dave Herman  possibly his lawyers  I have no idea of that part of this whole thing  and long story short  we won the lawsuit  yes  because we knew what the fuck we were doing  it went nowhere  with his wife and all that shit  yeah she called you  I mean  yeah  she called you  yeah  but can you imagine a guy  you know secretly taping you like that  and then he would come in all buddy buddy  remember he would come in all buddy buddy  hey laddie  well yeah  he is Australian too  so there you go  he's been outed  around here  from being a piece of shit 
[00:15:30]  I never forgot  and I never will  anyway  we move forward to yesterday  and what Anthony sent me  this guy Dave Herman  it's on the front page of the paper today  it says Herman Monster  Herman Monster  instead of Dave Herman  legendary rock jock Dave  busted in kitty sex sting  oh boy  sex sting  you don't want kitty sex sting  in the headline  shut out  no  that's worse than opie and dopey

[00:22:00]  how is it only  a ten year thing  when you  not just talk about  but when you go  to a foreign country  or whatever the fuck  that's considered  yeah yeah  and bring a doll  for a six year old  how is that not  a maximum of life  that's why fucking  these people have  recidivism rates  how is it not just  maximum life in prison  or minimum  yeah yeah  maximum is in general  population  and you give box cutters  to the inmates  that's the harshest  minimum is fucking  life in prison  I think the minimum  is like  you know  he's gonna get  way more than ten  I guess is what  I'm trying to say here  yeah I bet he will 
[00:22:30]  that's what they  could go with  either ten to life  but it looks like  there's more here  enough here  to give him  way more than ten  like years worth  of shit  I don't know  what you have to do  to only get the ten  right  I mean  yeah yeah yeah  maybe you're just  talking a good game  but you're not  actually going over  the line and going  okay I got the  you know the tickets  like now you're  you're proving  that you are gonna get  you are gonna do this  thing  I don't know if they  can do anything to you  for that  like if you're just talking  yeah  but it's when you  start to  like that guy  that got for the 
[00:23:00]  fucking  wants to cook  the chicks  the Gilbert  that cop  once you start  planning stuff  then you're in  trouble  so  and then the  article goes on  to give the  history of any  W and all that  crap in his  history  that's where we  come in  and then it  goes  the station  at the time  this is back  in 98  the station  at the time  had decided  to build itself  around Opie and  Anthony  part of whose  shtick was to  ridicule the  departing host  as fossils  as fossils  and pedophile  departing host 
[00:23:30]  as fossils  whose time  had passed  yes  that's 15  years ago  and we're not  even close to  how old these  guys were  so yes  they were fossils  soon after  Herman left  Opie and Anthony  had his estranged  wife Libby  on their show  mocking his  romantic skills  and calling him  a deadbeat dad  Herman soon  filed a 10  million dollar  lawsuit against  NAW's parent  company CBS  claiming it had  failed to deliver  his severance pay  and that the  Opie and Anthony  segment included  false and  defamatory statements  about him  Herman is due in 
[00:24:00]  court Friday  for what he  you know  let's separate that  again  for his fucking  nonsense  he's doing  court today  in St. Croix  oh can't wait  to hear what  happens  and like we  said if convicted  he faces 10  years to life  in prison along  with a $250,000  fine  if he has a  shred of decency  left he'll  fucking take his  shirt tie it  around a fucking  bar in the  jail and hang  himself  just fucking  off yourself  at this point  yeah he's got a  YouTube channel  where he talks  about his  bullshit career 
[00:24:30]  fucking bacteria  we have him  on YouTube  what's this  he had a YouTube  channel  yeah there's like  he talks about  radio  yeah  Matt from  Connecticut  sounds like he  wanted to abuse her  yeah it sounds  horrific  oh yeah  that line  that to me  that line  it's something  about that  it's gonna have  to be forceful  I might have  to be forceful  and the fact  that  to get it in  there  yeah  or to hold  her down  if they release  transcripts  I guarantee  there's other  fucking 
[00:25:00]  conversations  what else  they got  on the guy  they don't  offer everything  up  they know  alright  we have  all this  this is what  I'm assuming  we have  all this  on him  from 11 months  that we could  give you guys  this much  for now  a little taste  yeah  the  the  you know  the fucked up  thing  is  it sounds  like he's  done this  before  of course  you don't  start at 77  I don't think  do you  right  and the fact  that he says  you know  they're so sexy  at that age  like soft 
[00:25:30]  and stuff  almost like  he knows  from experience  he knows  right  but we  have no  fucking idea  whose lives  has he destroyed  already  you know  well who's  going to come  forward  yeah  yeah  and then he's  in St. Croix  I mean  oh god  yeah  imagine what  he's doing  with the  poor kids  down there  those guys  make that  kind of money  that they can  just have  vacation homes  in St. Croix  was that the  money back  because he was  retired for 20  years  he was making  a nice  fucking dime  during his  hey  yeah  you wonder  if there are  parents that  really do that 
[00:26:00]  because if he's  done it before  of course there are  parents that do that  not a lot  they kill their kids  yeah not a lot  Andrew Yates did  it's an incredibly  small number  but of course  you've heard about  this type of thing  before  yeah  so bad  of course they do  it's almost always  cops now too  you're like how dumb  are these criminals  it's great that  this is like an older  guy get caught crime  because somebody like  that for some reason  doesn't understand  that there's no way  he's not talking  to a cop  he was in a  Yahoo chat room  this one went down 
[00:26:30]  in a Yahoo chat room  who goes to  Yahoo chat rooms  oh boy  he's fucking  done  done  uh  the FM DJ  alright  here's a clip  from his  YouTube channel  Sam  I have been  now doing this  for about a year  and came in  for about eight  months  and the station  Cleveland  of WD  WDA  I forget 
[00:27:00]  they were  inter-office  what do you think  he's thinking  right now  I was getting  KSAN's playlist  which I would  scour  like  sound a little  effeminate  yeah but he's  also a very  functioning guy  for late 70s  if this is recent  he's not a  fucking  guy  daughtering  no  what do I think 
[00:27:30]  he's thinking  children  children  children  children  children  kids  children  young  young  children  Mozart's  A2  you know  how I joke  about pumping  things up  on the radio  yeah  he's pumping  up what he  was  he played  stupid records  and then I  saw the comedy  and spoken word  stuff they were  doing  and then I  saw excerpts  from a JFK  speech or  something  and I  said  wow I could  throw all  this shit  together  on the air  he started  in 72 
[00:28:00]  that just  sparked me  to figure out  how to do  it on my own  of course  the picture  they have  of him  in front  of the serious  logo  in the daily  news  I don't think  he ever  worked here  no  I don't think  so  or if he did  it briefly  and if he did  on a very  limited basis  I really don't  know if I had  an official  full time gig  here  what a  creep  he invented it  he did it  out of his head  I don't think  anybody else  would have  thought of  playing 
[00:28:30]  the Rolling  Stones  or like  here's a  perfect example  the Electric  Light  Orchestra  into  Beethoven  who's going  to listen  to that  and then  the  Mercury  Experiment  became  a huge  hit  it was  like  the top  radio  program  in New York  especially  certainly  the nighttime  show  even though  even though  I was  fucking  children  I hope  that  I'm on  the New York  radio message  board for the  first time  in years  I wonder  what they're  saying  it's 
[00:29:00]  Alan  sniffing  I went  last night  it's funny  you should  say that  I picked  three of my  favorite posts  here they are  who wants  to read them  so the  New York  radio message  board  who looks  at all  these  fucking  assholes  as gods  you know  they're  actually  first of all  not many  people go  there anymore  I noticed  I haven't  been there  in years  this type  of thread  would have  been like  I forget  hundreds and  hundreds of  posts  and there  was only  about  ten maybe  a story  this big  and there's  only like 
[00:29:30]  ten comments  about it  and here's  my three  favorite  which tells  you everything  you need to  know about  this New York  radio message  board  I like this  one  I feel sick  reading about  this  truly sick  to my stomach  I keep  hoping it's  some horrible  mistake  well it's  horrible  right  the mistake  part  well  we got  it  we got  to see  this one's  great  if true  it's incredibly  sad  I keep  hoping that  somehow  they've got  the wrong  Dave Herman 
[00:30:00]  yeah the wrong  DJ Dave Herman  that has  he goes  the wrong  Dave Herman  that there  are two  Dave Herman's  with homes  in New York  and St. Croix  or that Dave  knew he was  speaking with  federal agents  and was playing  mind games  with them  like  what a  hi Dave Herman  we're doing  a phone scam  with the FBI  it's a phone scam  hopefully  yeah hi  I want  to have  sex  with  a six  year old  hey it's 
[00:30:30]  Dave Herman  Dave Herman  there you go  damn  I'm just kidding  I'm just kidding  I only met  Dave once  and that was  back in the  70s  but his  on air  persona  was always  very classy  and he came  across as  someone who  could be  trusted  he played  stupid records  but this is  why people  it's hard to  believe  sorry  that Dave  Herman  would be  trying to  solicit a  very young  child for  sex  very 
[00:31:00]  very sad  and disappointing  sad  look at the  soft language  how sad  it's fucking  despicable  who gives a fuck  about his dumb  on air persona  yeah and these are the same  fucking people by the way  that's why I called them out  today as well  we did our shit  we should be executed  we should be thrown in the  Hudson River  remember tar and feather  yes yes of course  despicable  and here's a true  monster  a true monster  right  walking around 
[00:31:30]  and um  yeah very soft  language  did anybody say  he should be killed  if it's true  no  did anybody at that board  say if it's true  hell no  he should be fucking  hung  no  maybe this one's  a little rougher  um  please let us  remember there's a  presumption of  innocence until guilt  is proven in court  of course  all right  and there is  that's  that's someone that's  very delusional  but uh yeah  I understand that's  what happens  at this point  but you're very  delusional  they had him for 11  months  they had him on the  hook for 11 months  before they decided  to reel him in  when this stuff was 
[00:32:00]  written these laws  about presumption  which is of course  important  you're presumed guilty  these days  but it's because  the FBI didn't have  fucking computer records  yeah  and photos  back then  exactly  it was just kind of  he said she said  yeah they kind of  sort it all out  oh the shit that's  going to come out  on this one  they don't just  give you everything  first day  oh boy  they're going to  give you a little  more of this tomorrow  can I guarantee  they're on his computer  in New York  they got to get his  computer in New York  and you know  see if they're there  oh he can't even  go home and like 
[00:32:30]  clean house or anything  picture the way  you live with pornography  let's just say  whatever it is you like  just write lesbian shit  whatever it is you  really watch  picture if that  became illegal  and then you left town  and they came back  and got your computer  oh boy  do you know what I mean  like you're fucking  oh my god  right  well ASPCA  would be so pissed  at me  all these innocent  eels  eels  and we didn't know  Anthony spoke Japanese  oh wow  so  you see that  that commercial 
[00:33:00]  speaking of that  there's a commercial  on now for some  fucking stuff  to relieve  constipation  and shit like that  and there's this  Asian girl  in a flowing  white dress  and she's like  walking towards  some big box  of this fucking  laxative  or some shit  I'm like  that's hilarious  because of like  tub girl  like all I think of  is like she takes  this stuff  and finally she's  not constipated  and then they just  show her legs up  in the air  in a bathtub  with a geyser  of brown fucking  liquid coming out  her ass  that's what I thought  anyway  that's what I would have 
[00:33:30]  thought  this story's just sad  he was marvelous  in the morning  well  he's not marvelous  now  we were talking  in the Yahoo chat room  I can't imagine  yeah  but it was good  I suggested liquor  oh you suggested that  sure  booze  yeah Dave  get her a drinky poo  he probably knew  like through experience  that the booze works  yeah you know  oh they get a little upset  but you know  you gotta booze them up  a little bit  oh fuck 
[00:34:00]  my mom admitted to  giving us a little  taste of bourbon  when we were teething  you know  to knock us out  a little bit  but Jesus  good old days  what the fuck  yeah  dude this shit  is just  you don't  start  by going to  a foreign country  with a fucking  stuffed animal  to me  I don't think  anybody's first  foray into pedophilia  yeah yeah  is being in a  foreign country  with a doll  at the airport  right  there's no way  that can be  somebody's first 
[00:34:30]  fucking time  doing this  could you imagine  how much they  wanted to fucking  kill him  like the  the cops  that finally  arrested him  just walking up  and going  there he is  and he's just  sitting there  with a stuffed  animal  you're like  you fucking  yeah  I'm sorry  you just want  to pop him  in the head  yeah  he bought  the plane  tickets  from LaGuardia  for the mom  and the kid  he thought  he thought  he was in  yeah  they got  the fake  he's just  waiting at  the airport  fake identifications  for the mother  and the kid  so he could  buy the tickets  so there's  the names 
[00:35:00]  the ages  he knew  right  like there's  no saying  oh I didn't  know  I thought  she was 18  or yeah  oh yeah  he did the  flights himself  so he had  a type inch  you know  Lexi  I guess  the fake  name  of the girl  is 6  and this  is her name  and her dress  they got him  that's fucking  hard  oh they got him  if they're talking  to you that long  they're really  stockpiling information  oh yeah  building a solid  case  as they say  wow  we do

[00:40:00]  sad  very sad  never worked  with Dave  Herman  no  but you do  remember  I mean I  remember  when we  were just  talking about  the old  days of  radio  and you  you blurted  out the  hey Dave  Herman  play us  some  rock and  roll  yeah  it was  very  and sad  that  the  New York  Post  today  he has  to be  in front  of the  Sirius XM  logo  look at you  more of a  company man  than caring  about stupid  Dave Herman  that dumb  six-year-old  little dog  in the  background  did Dave  Herman ever  work here  I don't  know  it must  have been  maybe a  tribute  to 
[00:40:30]  classic  rock  or album  rock  or something  or  a tribute  to  progressive  rock  child  fucking  mediocrity  look at  that  fucking  legit  lecture  what a  creep  that's a  couple years  ago  nice smile  delightful  man  I had  worked with  a guy  many years  ago  a heck  of a  nice  guy  worked  at this  radio  station  for many  many  years  and  one day  we came  in  and they  a couple  of the  computers  were missing  and they  said they  confiscated  them  he was  fired  because  he was  trafficking  child 
[00:41:00]  pornography  I guess  downloading  it  and then  sharing  it  and then  forwarding  it  to  no  he didn't  work here  at a  radio station  I guess  he did  yeah  I guess  he did  between  traffic  reports  he'd  go online  so Danny  this was  a friend  of yours  I would  say  co-worker  co-worker  co-worker  a lot of  information  they found  all this  kiddie porn  in a  folder  marked  jingles  jingle  package  jingles 
[00:41:30]  and air  checks  are nothing  compared to  Mitch  Kumpstein  why do  these guys  think they  were something  in radio  I guess  because  there's a whole  bunch of  these Dave  Herman guys  we saw a bunch  of them  at NEW  why were they  special  well I guess  because they  were the  grandfathers  of rock  and roll  the guys  who were the  pioneers  of that  type of  format  they just  sat in the  seat  when music  was being  revolutionized  and that's  what they  were able  to bring  bring you  they didn't  bring any 
[00:42:00]  of it  they just  happened to  be taking  up the  spot  they got  credit for  it  they got  credit for  it  for introducing  it to people  people actually  thought they  were the ones  no  that came up  with the songs  that introduced  America to the  Beatles  the Beatles  were going to  be the Beatles  no matter  what  like  Brucey said  cousin Brucey  would say  it was the  right time  the right  place  there was no  book so  they wrote  the book  you had a  50,000 watt  radio station  in New York  City  welcoming the  Beatles  you had a  big station  in Baltimore  welcoming the  Beatles  it had nothing 
[00:42:30]  to do with  the jocks  is what I'm  saying  if you were  around  you would  have been  in the seat  and getting  all the  credit  and I  wish I  wasn't  and I  guess  so do  you at  the time  but you're  a very  successful  broadcaster  doing what  you do  but I never  respected  talking in  between  records  I did  it for  a while  I thought  it was a  joke  I'm like  anyone  could do  this  this is  I'm thinking  I better  do something  else  because I  can't  make a living  out of this  it's embarrassing  to say  hey here's  Led Zeppelin  who gives  a fuck 
[00:43:00]  they know  it's Zeppelin  there's a lot  of people  who could  not do  I could  not do  what you  do  I could  not open  myself up  and do  what you  do  and talk  like that  and you  know what  I don't  well first  of all  you're selling  yourself  sure as much  as we kind  of goof  around and beat  each other  up  you're showing  that you  actually can  do this  exactly  but you know  what Jimmy  talks about  on his  advice show  and his  addictions  and stuff  there's a lot  of guys  that maybe  have these  addictions 
[00:43:30]  and don't  let it out  like that  so you think  they should  get on air  and talk  about how  they want  to fuck  seven year olds  and six  six year olds  because that's  the perfect  age  they're all  soft and  shit  they should  seek counseling  and you just  put yourself  in that category  no no no  because I  enjoy doing  I enjoy  collecting  jingles  I enjoy  air checks  I enjoy  talking up  songs  what do  you think  his hard  driver hits  looked like  wow  I don't want to  know  but he definitely  had the long  versions  I'm sure  he had every  Gary Glitter  song ever  fucking  recorded 
[00:44:00]  did you want  to talk about  birthdays  a new one  from Gary Glitter  ladies and gentlemen  on Dave Herman's  Rock and Roll  Morning Show  he was also  the disc  jackie  the first  disc  jackie  WPLJ  I think  the morning  man there  he gave  the station  those call  letters  evidently  white  lemon juice  he was just  a  who cares  if it's  called  WPLJ  it doesn't  matter  what does  that mean  even  he gave  them  WPLJ  great  because it  used to  be known  as  WABC  FM  and they  said  they  had  identity  yeah but  then they  had to  pick some  letters  not just  any  letters 
[00:44:30]  though  these  letters  stood  for  something  what did  they stand  for  white  port  lemon  juice  which  is  an  old  blues  song  okay  so  now you  got Scott  Shannon  tearing  it up  in the  mornings  over there  exactly  white  port  but why  is that  important  why is  that  important  at the  time I  guess it  was  something  very big  to say  wow  this is  a new  format  nobody  was playing  this music  it was  only  AM radio  it was a  different time  back then  you didn't  have the  internet  you didn't 
[00:45:00]  have  what you  have now  downloading  it was  just a  different way  to get the  music  four other  letters at  the people  it would  have been  the same  thing  I just  pulled a  mic  francesa  with  the  age  I can  only think  anytime  something  spills  now  I just  think  of  Mike  francesa  spilling  his  clumsily  spilling  his  daily  news  isn't  backing  off  they  got  the  whole  fucking  war  in  the  paper  they  love  it  but  is  this  the  song  yeah  is it  the  four  deuces  no  it's  the only  one  that's  in  the  system  one 
[00:45:30]  big  deuce  and  which  one  would  that  be  Dave  Herman  knew  this  song  and  said  okay  we'll  name  this  station  WPLJ  I guess  when they  were looking  around  because  that was  the  title  of the  song  four  deuces  add up  to  eight  which  is  a year  older  than  Dave's  wheelhouse  or two  years  it's a  shame  and I'm  glad  that  he was  intercepted  I guess  by the  police  because  hey  we don't  know  what  would  have  happened  you  what makes 
[00:46:00]  it a little  easier is  the fact  that there  was no  six year  old  stevie  wonder  isn't  she  lovely  happy  sweet  sixteen  this  morning  do you  have  six  candles  always  a nice  song  that I  play  at  birthday  parties  maybe  for a  christening 
[00:46:30]  celebration  or a  communion  or something  she  was  six  years  old  so you  guys  all  excited  you gotta  kind of  shoot  you gotta  shoehorn that  because it's  sixteen  right  she  was  six  years  old  leave  her  alone  young  girl  get out  of my  mind  Gary  Puckett  in the  union  that's  right 
[00:47:00]  so the  guy that  sat in  the seat  when music  was being  revolutionized  gets a lot  of credit  for doing  what  a pioneer  of broadcasting  obviously he had a lot  of free time  for his hobbies  he couldn't have  been that busy  no kidding  back in the day  these guys were  playing vinyl  and they were  busy  they were  keeping busy  playing these  albums  looking at the  liner notes  playing guitar  on there  who produced  the album  bringing you  the information  I gotta 
[00:47:30]  queue up  vinyl records  who gives a  fuck  the toughest  part of the  job at  the time  was not  stomping on  the floor  too hard  because the  needle would  skip  that was it  right  who can't  queue up  a record  and then  push play  and say  hey  here's  ELO  give us a  fuck  buy the  album  and get  the liner  notes  yourself  you could  do that  you could  be the  DJ  but you  know what  these guys  brought these  albums  because they  had the  albums first 
[00:48:00]  it's not  like today  when a new  song comes  out  it's leaked  it's on the  internet  before it  even hits  the radio  sometimes  so these  guys were  able to  bring you  something  brand new  we have  the brand  new  Emerson Lake  and Palmer  album  we'll be  debuting it  today at  5 o'clock  and you'd  gather around  the radio  and you couldn't  wait to hear  they were  store clerks  store clerk  all of a sudden  some new shit  comes on  and guess  what he's  going to  do  he's going  to make  sure the  people  have a chance  to fucking  buy it  right  they just  sent it to  him  right  leeches  they're like  pilot fish  with sharks  sucking off 
[00:48:30]  of them  and that's  what makes  this world  such a  beautiful  place  because  I can  disagree  with you  and you  can  disagree  with me  we can  all disagree  with Dave  Herman's  fucking  choices  so you guys  all excited  about  scream radio  on Sirius XM  channel 142  for Halloween  oh are they  going to play  the monster mash  you think  oh yeah  the Dave  Herman mash  a bunch of  good things  in there too  a lot of  scream radio  going on  at Dave  Herman's  house  a house  of horror  yeah I  can't wait 
[00:49:00]  to hear the  stories that  have come out  of that St.  Croix house  that he's got  and they will  label it  the house  of horrors  right  you know  I bet you  it comes out  that other  people were  brought down  there  we got Craig  in Michigan  deal with this  Craig  go ahead  hey guys  I was hoping  that Denny  would come on  and have  some disgusting  shit to say  about this  pedophile  and it kind  of seems like  you're stroking  him a little  bit like  well  he's juggling 
[00:49:30]  vinyl  yeah you're  defending him  Denny  I didn't work  with the guy  I just said  what he did  I didn't work  with him  I don't know  what his  habits were  there you go  you know  you know what  Denny told me  during the  commercial break  let's keep in  mind  innocent until  proven guilty  that is right  yeah exactly  oh Jesus  I mean  legally that's  correct but  it's a New York  radio message board  attitude because  they don't want  to admit that  this guy  I mean Denny's  not denying it  but that Herman  could be this guy  but he could be  this guy  guy's got a  problem  he's got a  problem  he's got a  problem  when you drink 
[00:50:00]  too much  but all that  is true  but he's a  fucking  he should be  he should be  throat cut  if he's guilty  even hardcore  criminals hate  guys like this  without a doubt  this is like  the top  almost everyone  can agree  this shit  is horrendous  behavior  they hate  guys like this  in prison  we've heard  the stories  over the years  I'm not  defending what  he did  I'm just  defending  disc jockeys  I'm not  defending what  he did  I know  I do 
[00:50:30]  that  I just  never bought  into the  guy that  played the  records as  being important  yeah  I guess  I mean I  understand that  and a lot  of people did  and a lot  of people  aspired to  do that  I thought  it was cool  at first  that people  out there  could hear  my voice  and then  after a while  I'm like  fuck  remember when  Carol used to say  remember Carol  used to say that  she would be like  we're their  friends  we're people's  friends  at WNW  yeah  there's a lot  of people  who do believe  that 
[00:51:00]  oh I know  voice  and there's a lot  of people  call the radio  station  and listen  Ira  oh we should  get Ira  he's around  here today  no I don't  think so  he's naughty  he's not here  because Jay Thomas  is not here  today  Jay Thomas  has Fridays  off too  no he  he's on  hiatus  he's taking  eight months  off for like  some kind  Thailand  no  eight months  eight weeks  for what  he's got some  kind of surgery  or something  neck surgery  something like  that  neck surgery 
[00:51:30]  from an old  football injury  injury  yeah  really  injury back  in college  what happened  to him  injury  an old  football injury  injury  did you watch  the John Spano  thing  yeah  we all thought  that he was  going to lead us  to the promised  land when he  brought the  Islanders back  in the day  this is going  to be great  that 30 for  30 is hot  yeah  big shot  go check it  out man  I was in a cab  yesterday  and they had  I guess they  had the fan on  I don't even 
[00:52:00]  know  I think it was  the fan  and they were  talking to him  I got to hear  them interview  John Spano  really  I guess he's  doing some  kind of investing  down in Texas  why would you  that's the guy  you want to give  your money to  there's a sucker  born every day  yeah  maybe he's got  his shit together  now  let's hope so  let's see  maybe he's seen  the error of his  yeah  he meant well  he did  that's where I  learned from the  the 30 for 30  because when I  when this story  hit years ago  in the mid 90s 
[00:52:30]  I'm like what a  kook  but you realize  the guy actually  meant well  and he thought  he could pull  off this crazy  deal with not  having any money  and then a lot  of people tweeted  me last night  saying there was  a bunch of other  guys that did  this type of  shit  supposedly I don't  know we'd have  to look it up  but I guess  George Steinbrenner  didn't have a lot  of money when he  got the Yankees  oh yeah  and he was able  to fudge the  numbers and finagle  some shit to get  that deal done  I'm sure he got  a bargain rate  back then  he bought it  from CBS  CBS owned the  team  but I don't know  if he had the  actual funds  to do that 
[00:53:00]  so he was able  to wheel and deal  and he was in  the horse business  or boat business  Steinbrenner  I think he built  boats  two very different  businesses there  Denny  yeah  horse business  or the boat  business  a boat of  transportation  yeah  not really  he makes like  Cuisinarts  or spaceships  one or the other  I'm not quite sure  horse or fucking  boats  well if I had  done my show  prep  you know so  you would have  known  a faux pas  so what's  the scream channel 
[00:53:30]  that SiriusXM  is doing  it's  it's direct  from Dave Herman's  basement  of his  St. Croix  estate  a Halloween  theme channel  yeah  you know  so I guess  scary sound effects  and scary stories  and lots of  Halloween songs  like the songs  yeah  one odd  one horn  flying purple  people  leader  like that  like that  maybe Dead Man's Party  by Oingo Boingo  oh  okay  that's a good one  yeah  what are some of the other  great Halloween songs  of all time  he was singing 
[00:54:00]  the Monster Mash  oh you gotta do  Monster Mash  oh sure  yeah  and I always liked  in the 80s  he did the Monster Rep  you like that  oh no  shock the body  shock the body  it's a good one  see if that's  it's a good one  I have that on the hard drive  of hits  see you really  it's a good one  and also Dave Seville  the witch doctor  oh yeah  the witchy woman  right  squeeze that in  I told the witch  something the witch doctor  told me what to do  boom boom boom  what about Frankenstein 
[00:54:30]  of course  great instrumental  Edgar Winter Group  we got the Monster Rap  so you said  this is great  it's fun  it's fun  yeah it's fun  it's fun  Bobby Boris  I think it was great  I have this song  April Falls  oh April Falls  October  he sort of  took off on  Monster Mash  and just updated it  oh  I like that song  Monster Rap  the kids all like rap  so  we'll run DMC 
[00:55:00]  which is 84  wow this sounds  really great  like that  man  oh that's shit  when does it get good  it's getting good 
[00:55:30]  shock the body  shock the body  shock the body  shock the body  shock the body  shock the body  this is terrible  yeah  it's so bad  it's good  no  it's just bad  this is kind of there  how about Evil Woman  ELO  yeah  that's a good one too  you think they'll play that over on the Scream channel  I'm sure they will  yeah  I also like the Freaks Come Out at Night by Houdini  remember that one  that was an old good rap song  oh look at that  that's more of a sexual thing though 
[00:56:00]  back in the game  he's going old school  oh yeah  going old school  old school  what does this have to do with Dave Herman  nothing  who listens to Halloween  fucking stupid spooky Halloween music  gives a shit  who's listening to Halloween radio anytime  no one  not even on Halloween  it's fucking horrible  are you uh  are you uh  coming to the Halloween bash 
[00:56:30]  after uh  your gig with Dice  over my house  yes  yes  it's a week out  yeah next Friday  yeah  next Friday  I will be coming after  oh  shooting right over  yeah  zipping right over  some idiot on Twitter  uh  he occasionally grabs my  my picture  and puts my name up  like it's a fake me account  and like starts inviting people  to my house  and  asking Jimmy like  when are you coming to the party  I just fucking block him  but uh 
[00:57:00]  yeah  so if you see something  that  say something  you better  you better say something else  click on it  make sure it's me  right  for the love of God  all right Danny  this was terrific  Danny  um  I'm sorry  you really added to this great story  that's hitting today  that's true  a lot more info  take care  we got some  more info  right  are we doing okay  as far as Halloween goes  everything's good  no I mean our show  is there anything else  we should be doing  I'm just uh  loving Jocktober  it's uh  fantastic  oh yeah  it's just a  it's just a shame 
[00:57:30]  those parody songs are horrible  yep  but you know what  not a funny  not a good point  not to cut you off  but it's Friday  we do have uh  Scott and Todd today  ah  oh  there you go  hi  and our eternal quest  for yet another catchphrase  uh  I don't know  anything  um  you think you saw something in there  maybe  there's a  yeah I think there is  it's a battery car  it's like a battery car 
[00:58:00]  it's like a  it's like a battery car  it's like a battery car  it's like a battery car  it's like a battery car  can we go through all of them  I got a tree on my house  I got that one  and then we got  I want to see the boat movie  and then we got  it's like a battery car  do you agree they stink  they're horrible  oh wow  Jenny  coming around  they're just not funny guys  coming around  Scott you gotta  I mean Scott  the guy who really created  was one of the co-creators 
[00:58:30]  of the Morning Zoo format  which swept the country  in the 80s  but I respect him  for doing that  at least  because it was different  for the time  it was different  what about Mojo Radio  Mojo Radio  wasn't successful  no  but he created basically  the Morning Zoo  I respect that way more  than just talking  in between dumb records  that you've heard  a million times  well I mean  the whole song parody things  and the phony phone calls  do people really believe  those are legit  yeah  there's plenty of people  that do  because they're being played 
[00:59:00]  on a lot of big stations  you ever hear the roses one  fucking hilarious  bunch of flowers  it's to the wrong guy  I'm like uh oh  gonna get nutty  it's fake  pull over  of course  my mother loves them  it's fake  of course she does  and then  with anything that's creative  it gets watered down  eventually  like when Scott Shannon  invented the Morning Zoo  it was probably  kind of cool and hip  and different  but then everyone  just copies off each other  waters the shit down  until it's unlistenable  how many zoo crews  were there across the nation  right  every market probably had one 
[00:59:30]  yeah  so he sucks  he should kind of  maybe step down  I didn't say that  about Scott  it's just that  I think a guy  with his talent  I'm sure they could do  a lot better  he doesn't have any talent  anymore  well  was Iraq part of a zoo crew  yeah  Iraq was on a zoo crew  was that right  no  were you officially  Scott and Todd right  it was PLJ  but they weren't a zoo crew  no  well no  whatevs  whatevs  shut up  were they the nut hut  no  they were the big show  the big show  oh what happened  there was no zoo 
[01:00:00]  like they had  done away with the zoo  by then  when he came back  they were still doing  the zoo at zoo 100  oh  so he became  Scott and Todd  gotcha  more importantly  we got Larry King  checking in  thank god  really  oh wow  Larry  hello  hi Larry  how are you bud  great  Opie Anthony  how are you boys  oh good  good  what do you got today sir  what happened  to the stuffed animal  Larry would like to know  what happened  to the stuffed animal  I swear to you 
[01:00:30]  I was thinking  the same thing  you got the homeland guys  arresting Dave Herman  down there in St. Croix  and he's waiting  with a stuffed animal  for the mom  and the six year old girl  to arrive  Lexi  and I was thinking  to myself  like do they  carefully make  you know  make sure the  stuffed animal  comes with them  that stuffed animal  is in a sealed  plastic bag  with a tag in it  on a shelf  in an evidence room  waiting to be shown  in court  and I need to know  what kind of  stuffed animal  he thought was  appropriate for  for kid fucking  oh god  and he showed up 
[01:01:00]  with this  right  and they show  the animal  you think he had  good presentation  oh yeah  holding a big  stuffed animal  in his right hand  dude  if they would  have gotten  off of that plane  of a mother  and this little  girl  and he'd have  been like  hi Lexi  right  and give her  the animal  you like this  just fucking  like eyeballing  her  oh  on the ride  back to his house  thank god  it was the police  on the ride  back to the house  you know  everyone's probably  like  it's almost 
[01:01:30]  festive  she's playing  with her new  stuffed animal  unbeknownst to her  with the horror  that awaits her  but the mom  is all big eyed  cause like  wow  St. Croix  oh my god  this is great  Dave  I used to listen  to you  at any W  and let me tell you  and then there's  the turn  somewhere in the house  it all turns  mommy  I gotta go  to the bathroom  oh hey  hey  wait a minute  maybe I could  come in there  and help you  and then the turn  he's mixing  some kind of  cocktail 
[01:02:00]  yeah  some concoction  and a little  fucking  cue ominous music  oh  and a little  sippy cup  she's watching  her dumb door  some fucking  oh  a door  of the explorer  cup  full of fucking  vodka  what a creep  mom's unpacking  her suitcase  oh god  and there has  to be  the turn  she's gotta  sit there  just staring  at a tv  set  shaking  knowing what's  going on  in the other  room  oh christ  oh god  kill the guy  he really  deserves death 
[01:02:30]  at this point  I don't understand  the people that  aren't for the  death penalty  and I know  this isn't  a death penalty  case  I would lower  the standards  of the death  penalty  trust me  it should be  so I don't even  want to hear  the argument  this is not even  a death penalty  case  I'm saying  it should be  exactly  they give third  offender drug  users like  the rockefeller  laws the guys  that just smoke  and pot  they give those  guys 25 years  of their life  in prison  yeah yeah  and this guy's  got a 10 year  come on man  that's going to be  way more than 10  oh yeah but  minimum should be  higher  yeah I don't know 
[01:03:00]  what  I'm sure the  minimum isn't  higher so they  don't have that  where a judge  has to go like  I'd like to give  you less because  of the circumstance  like something  like because that's  almost those  mandatory sentencing  things that are  a little weird  but if you leave  the leeway open  to life then the  judge can do  whatever the fuck  he pleases so  hopefully he gives  him life in prison  well life to the guy  at this point could  be 10 years  oh yeah  that's true  77 years old  so I mean he's  fucked  what happens to 
[01:03:30]  all the guys on  the TV show  Catch a Predator  basically the same  thing  what happens to  those guys  they do updates  and stuff  they usually go to  jail  they usually do  a few years  in jail  it's very rare  that some of them  get probation  or something like  that  did those guys  actually get  locked up  they get locked  up  you read the  thing and it  says this one  got three years  they usually get  anywhere between  one year and  five years  but there must  have been some  that have had  previous encounters  and I've seen  them get as high  as like 10 years 
[01:04:00]  but yeah  it's usually  between one  and five years  after that one  guy did his  it was role  play  it was role  play  and he refused  to let go  of the fact  I knew it was  role play  and technically  it was  I think he got  off on that  and I think  that maybe  is what brought  the show down  because then  they realized  technically  it is role  play  and you can  use that  excuse  I expected  it was the show  pretty rough  though  you need a good  lawyer if you're  going to claim  role play  because it  is a crime  to just  even though  the person  on the other  end isn't 
[01:04:30]  an actual  kid  yeah  I don't know  but it still  makes the  Thanksgiving table  very awkward  for the rest  of your life  very awkward  yeah  congratulations  you were able  to figure out  the role play  angle but  yeah  yeah  but  pops isn't  fucking  buying it  yeah  yeah  as he says  pass the mashed  potatoes  but they claim  entrapment also  yeah  try not to  fuck the turkey  when you're  passing it over  yeah  exactly  you creep  all right  well we'll do  this  it's  jocktober  a celebration 
[01:05:00]  of all things  shitty in radio  that's not very  nice  fantastic failures  of pontificating  proportions  that's so bad  wow  an interactive  exploration of  what makes  radio rancid  jocktober  o-f-g  hosts  holes  bits  and stunt  boys  this isn't funny  it's time for  jocktober  we only have 
[01:05:30]  a week left  of this shit  right  yes  i was thinking  about it in the  shower this morning  oh man  this is  time to move  on from this  yes  yeah i gave  that same thought  yesterday  i was driving  and i'm just  kind of like  oh man  what's the  what's the day  well imagine  if you had to  sit in the office  listening  oh my god  it was  terrible  the whole shows  it's scott and todd  fridays  yeah  it's part of  this year's  jocktober  yeah  and i'm just 
[01:06:00]  looking at the  track  you're just  horrified again  you know how  this works  should not be a  surprise at this  point  this is the  last one for the  month  is it  no  no last scott and  todd  no  no  there'll be the  big grand finale  we squeezed in a  couple extra ones  last year after  october was over  and don't worry  we'll finish out the  week  next friday's  november 1st  right  so we gotta  still do a scott and 
[01:06:30]  todd  no next friday's  january  33rd  are you sure  let's get right  into this  scott and todd  talk about the  lotto  scott comes up  with an absolutely  hilarious premise  yeah wait till you  hear this i mean the  banter's going around  the room and  denny said it the  guy's talented  yeah you're right  right denny let  this speak to it  i believe so  you believe he's 
[01:07:00]  still talented  i believe so  uh-huh  yeah i just think  maybe they're you  know just  not going through  the motions but  giving people  you guys all  drink the same  kool-aid  they're doing  benchmarks  they're doing  benchmarks  people liked it  yesterday  they liked it  last year  they're gonna  like it today  this is not a  benchmark  this is banter  okay  do you think  michael jordan's  still talented  as far as  playing in the  nba  sure i'm sure  he still has  not to play in  the nba  not at that  level but he  still has  the talent  scott does not  have the talent  he did some  good things for  radio  not the type of 
[01:07:30]  things we enjoy  but certainly  he made his  contribution  but he's not  talented anymore  no  he's all done  he's done  why are we  debating that  he stinks  because this  guy will not  fucking give  in  he's fucking  awful  he's a cornball  he's a cornball  alright here's the  lottery thing  we're lotto  one ticket  for a million bucks  sold in new york  and one ticket  for a million bucks  sold in new jersey  so  check your tickets 
[01:08:00]  you check your tickets  no I didn't check  on any of them  I wonder if  if you win  an extra ticket  if the sound  is the same  if you win  a million bucks  what  what do you think  I don't know  it probably has  the same sound  I don't think  they have different  sound effects  in there  if you win  a million dollars  I think the thing  ought at least  explode  no just make a  I know I would  just make a bigger  noise  I'll make a bigger  noise if I win  a million dollars  because you know  if you're standing 
[01:08:30]  beside someone  checking their tickets  you're standing  behind them  you get that  right  holy shit  what a fucking  lousy radio show  that's the longest  we've heard him talk  exactly  yeah yeah  wow  if I was part of  that show  I would just  fucking sit back  and let him  babble like that  do you think  if you win  another ticket  you get the  same thing  with the sound  I don't know  you like that  he go  you get that  little noise  you get that  little noise 
[01:09:00]  I'll make a bigger  noise if I win  a million dollars  because you know  if you're standing  beside someone  checking their tickets  you're standing  behind them  you get that  little noise  you get that  little noise  yeah and fucking  Scott's realistic  sounding for it  gravelly  the kids  are like  rock and roll  he's making us  laugh  I wish fire  could fall  out of the ceiling  I wish the ceiling 
[01:09:30]  would open  and fire  would just fall  I wish you were  on a plane  to St. Croix  to meet up  with your pal  exactly  no he's not my pal  please let's set  the record straight  fair enough  no he's only  a file trading partner  is that right  no no no  no no  Denny's close friend  and travel partner  and timeshare partner  St. Croix  condo  the gang  talks about  marijuana butter 
[01:10:00]  yeah yeah  somebody got busted  for marijuana  and they said  they were going to  make butter  out of it  marijuana butter  and so  Scott might have  missed a point  this is the guy  that Denny thinks  is talented  by the way  you got marijuana  butter  you got a room  full of people  you got to see  okay which direction  is this room  I'm going to go in  sure  and the room  starts veering  one way  and Scott goes  wait wait wait  I got an idea  and steers  steers the room  in a completely  opposite  right 
[01:10:30]  beautiful  right  her defense attorney  said she had  a quarter pound  of marijuana  which frankly  isn't a lot  especially if you're  doing edibles  maybe boiling it  down for butter  or whatever  that's right  butter  marijuana butter  what  you ever have that  Outback has that  that's Jason Ernest  Outback  with the blooming onion  give me the blooming onion  and some of that  marijuana butter  show me that marijuana  I never  man  that's why that line  so long to get in there  everybody wants to get  the marijuana butter  it's not a lot  especially if you're  doing edibles  maybe boiling it down 
[01:11:00]  for butter  I still like to eat it  outback  I like it there  man they got a great  dessert menu too  it's like somebody's  doddering old grandfather  is sitting there  and you just politely nod  like they're part of the conversation  you don't want to really hurt  their feelings  he doesn't want to ruin  the sponsorship possibilities  I still like eating it  outback  that's good stuff there  they got a good  dessert menu  they got a good  dessert menu  and they'll blend 
[01:11:30]  the food  if you ask them  so you can drink it  with a straw  not a lot  especially if you're  doing edibles  maybe boiling it  down for butter  I still like to eat it  outback  I like it there  man they got  a great dessert menu  too  gotta have that  what a worthless  statement  they got chairs  I like that  that little sound  at the beginning  I like the outback  you want to say  I got an idea  but you don't have  an idea  you got a statement  like where are we 
[01:12:00]  going next  with this weed stuff  and then he's like  I like outback  I like turtles  they eat a steak  yeah they got a steak  a blooming onion  that's good stuff  I get a dessert  outback  I think we could all  agree that we were wrong  and Denny was right  this guy has a lot  of fucking talent  you think SiriusXM  should bring Scott Shannon  aboard to do a morning show  I don't believe so  he's making a pretty  big salary there  I'm sure he  yeah that's what 
[01:12:30]  is sad  for young guys  trying to come up  these assholes  that continue sitting  in the seats  that's why we had to wait  we had to wait  for a seat to open up  Todd is still waiting  and he's like 50 something  half your career  radio is waiting  for one of these  fucking guys  to give up their seat  I can't give up my seat  and it's up to the  you know the people  that run the radio stations  to kick these fucking  guys out of their seats  to give the young guys 
[01:13:00]  a shot  I'm coming back  I'm just going to  outback  I got that  I'm going to give up  one of the steaks  and the blooming onion  I got to give up my seat  with the marijuana butter  he might still be pulling  in the big numbers  though in the morning  and they might be  no he's not  he's not  he's not  okay he's not  I don't think so  I like dessert  they got a good dessert menu  well  what an elderly thing  to say  yeah  do they have the  early bird special there  nah they got good desserts  I got to do a live read 
[01:13:30]  I'll be happy  hey man  you want to go in  and get crazy  I'm glad you're doing  the voice  because this next clip  features Todd  prominently  until Scott decides  he needs to  kind of get in there  yeah  say rushes like that  like  Scott's  Scott  isn't comfortable  with the dynamic  like Todd says  the dynamic is  I make the funny voices  and make the jokes 
[01:14:00]  and Scott  kind of just points me  in a direction  Scott is like  no just a couple  of funny guys  making jokes  a couple of funny  fun guys  just knocking it around  we both do voices  yeah  you can make marijuana butter  by boiling it  with the other ingredients  and then you get  I never thought about that  yeah there you go  I never  that never even  occurred to me  weed butter  yeah  hey  have me a weed butter  bud butter  is a nickname for it too  bud butter  bud butter  right  and the power  I can't believe it  it's not butter  it's not 
[01:14:30]  weed butter  it's not  weed butter  I can't even  feel my own nose  you think Fabio  will do that  commercial  I can't believe  it's no butter  spray  I can't  I can't feel  my own nose  no  he said it again  oh that's great  he sounds like  a guarded  Dachau  he said it twice  that was  that was  that was my  Scott Shannon  clip of the week  I can't feel  my own nose  Scott Shannon  has Fabio  saying I can't  feel my own nose 
[01:15:00]  I can't feel my own nose  what are you talking about  I'd like to see him  saying that  while grabbing his chest  at the bottom of the stairs  Eric you gotta add  all these clips  to the  Scott Shannon  chucked full of them  today  I love it  I like our back  I love that  I gotta hear the whole clip  again  you can make  marijuana butter  by boiling it  with the other ingredients  I never thought about that  there you go  I never  that never even  occurred to me  weed butter  yeah  hey 
[01:15:30]  ask me a weed butter  bud butter  is a nickname for it too  bud butter  bud butter  right  I can't believe  it's not butter  it's not  weed butter  it's fantastic  I can't even feel  my own nose  you think Fabio  will do that commercial  I can't believe  it's no butter  spray  I can't  I can't feel  my own nose  no  he waits  he waits  until the laughing  dies down  to make sure  nobody's stepping  on him  because he said  I'm getting 
[01:16:00]  his nose line  through  well he knew  he had a doozy  you know  I'm getting  his nose line  through  and I'm gonna  do it with  a Fabio accent  now  that's humiliating  do you like  that joke  Danny  well I just  don't think  every listener  is as critical  as you guys  ripping it apart  all the time  it's just there  it's a companion  for the ride  it's not a companion  for the ride  it's not  it shouldn't  be going  it shouldn't  just be there  exactly  it's a companion  for the road  a fucking hose  in the exhaust pipe  in the window  they stink 
[01:16:30]  it's like  it's like driving  to work  with a strange  old man  with Alzheimer's  sitting next to you  yes  exactly  just yelling  things at you  that don't make  any sense  I like Outback  battery car  yeah  but he annoys me  less than Todd  Todd to me  is the true  fucking horror show  in this  even though Scott  stinks  it's a senior citizen  shouting non sequiturs  at you  and then some  retard in the backseat  doing weird voices  because he thinks  he's younger and hip  yeah you know  you gotta say things  kinda like you're crazy  oh fuck yourself 
[01:17:00]  do a fake phone call  I like how Jimmy  has spun it away  from Scott Shannon  brilliantly by the way  brilliantly  it drives me nuts  because we were  kinda letting him  off the hook  yeah he's worse  at least Scott  has been a contributor  he's a guy  who did  like you said  in fairness  he creates  the morning zoo  that's a tremendously  successful thing  and was very  very funny  when it was done right  and he loves Outback  it was funny  for others  I understand  why people  would enjoy  something like that  you know  because people 
[01:17:30]  always wonder  what are you  going to beat up  everything  no I understand  why that worked  for the time  dude I'm on the road  I don't mind  doing a zoo crew  if they have  a good energy  a zoo crew  is a fun show  to go in and do  because they have  good energy  it's like  you're just  you're joking around  when they're  when they're right  and they're not  totally douchey  they're great  to go on and promote  and be honest  Scott Shannon  does a dead on  Fabio  well yeah  I thought Fabio  was in the studio  and I can't believe  it's not butter  I'm not sure  I'm just gonna improv  I'm not sure  if he does a dead on  I gotta hear it  one more time  oh  I can't believe 
[01:18:00]  it's not butter  spray  I can't  I can't feel  my own nose  no  I can't feel  my own nose  nose  oh my  it sounded more like  Ricardo Montalbong  yeah  second attempt  at the nose  well it worked  the first time  if it's a one  the first time  you don't fucking  bring it back  when it's quieter  yeah  but a minus  you got a minus  five on that  and that cackling  woman  could you just  replay that  listen to her  fucking  cackling  listen to her  fucking 
[01:18:30]  cadence pacing  laugh  it's fucking  enraging  I'm just happy  to be there  can you think  Fabio will do  that commercial  I can't believe  it's not butter  spray  I can't  I can't feel  my own nose  no  I can't  I can't  feel my  I can't feel  my own nose  I can't feel  my own nose  it's a little  of everything  there's a little  Arnold Schwarzenegger  in there  Ted Kennedy  fucking  Chip  it was so  bad  it was so  bad  she couldn't  even muster  up  dumb laugh 
[01:19:00]  yeah  she sounds  like Craig  Schenkel  this is where  it just  fucking  drives me  nuts  because  now we're  up to the  song  fucking  this is  Bill  Whippinpooper  come in  with the  energy  good news  everybody  I will  say this  yeah  this Scott  and Todd  Friday is  going to  drag on  for the  next few  minutes  but  then we're  going to  finish  strong  that's how  I'm going  to sell  Sam Roberts  I like that  I can't  fucking  fake it  to the  people  oh you  got a  funny  phone  call  I hope  hey  you got

[01:40:30]  hold on a second  bro this is terrible  Jim unless they figure  something out  I will promote you  all morning long  of course you're  the sell out king  at the comedy club  but some technicians  engineers  zucked me up  a little bit here  okay  we'll try to do it  a little later then  how's that sound  I love it  we'll get back to you  but you gotta get out  we could do a break  on this end  if you want to  just get out for now  yeah I'm out for now  yeah  how do you think  that happened  I don't know  it's feeding back 
[01:41:00]  somehow  it's only when you talk  he's gotta mute it  that's Jackie  DJ Paulie G  I think what's going on  on their end  I don't know if they can  hear us or not  there's something called  a mixed minus  and I think that they're  feeding us our own feed  well we can  I think they're blaming Mars  it probably is Mars  it's probably Mars' fault  Mars you can't leave them up  because if they're not here  it'll be up  I was just seeing if they  heard me or not  I think they're feeding us  our own feed  so there should be a button  they can take that out  but we could if you want to  it's up to you  but we could take a break 
[01:41:30]  and then try coming back  we'll break  and me we'll talk  to each other  hey maybe if you get  down there  talk to Opie  and see why they  don't like our radio show  I don't like feedback  but I like to  feed myself at the Outback  that's good  they got good  Bloomin' Onion  that's my name  this is Bloomin' Onions  calling  and this is  Pot Butter  on the phone  he might be a nice guy  I'm not talking about  him being a nice guy  it's Seymour  Schnizzle Walk  yeah  hey how you doing  I bought some earrings 
[01:42:00]  this is Mr. Poppy  Cockadoodoo  we're going to break  quickly  because maybe we can  still squeeze  before the Bobo  Lexi Love thing  and before the pitbull  of comedy  Bobby Sleep  but first this  the Opie and Anthony  show continues  in moments  in moments  in moments  in moments  Sirius XM 
[01:42:30]  and now  the Opie and Anthony  show  the Swiss thing again  see what's going on  over there  weather authority  I'm meteorologist  Marty Snyder  1500 cash or trade  plus tax and fees  well qualified  buy a CKL for details  Ralph Honda knows  you're  they're in commercials  up there in Rochester  Kimmy's flying out  in a little bit  he'll be in Rochester  all weekend  I would have flown out  yesterday  but I had to do  something  I am  I hate Flying Dave's show

[01:43:30]  oh I have another  clip we can play too  really  nice  well the big highlight  yesterday  well first of all  the cards won  I think most people  know that by now  it's 1-1-1-1  and you got the  James Taylor guy  fucking up the  National Anthem  yeah what happened  he started the  wrong song or something  he started singing  America the Beautiful  the real James Taylor  won't you please  welcome  the legendary  James Taylor  wow 
[01:44:00]  hey man pretty flawless  he fucking went right  back into it  he handled it perfectly  you gotta give him  remix  gotta give him the  credit there  oh beautiful  oh say  that was great man  he fucking slid right  into it  like he meant to do it  yes  oh he covered perfectly  perfect  and then what did  Joe Buck say  so Pearl Jam 
[01:44:30]  is  Pearl Jam  is  soundtracking  the World Series  like all  all the breaks  and all the music  that's being played  during the World Series  is all Pearl Jam  how did they make  that deal  because you know  Major League Baseball  recognizes they're the  best fan in the world  oh god  they're like we want  to do something  with you  money  we don't want to  we don't want to  give it a ticket  master  at the World Series  that's a little  that's a little  awkward now  we all  will acknowledge that  you meant well  at the time  but oops 
[01:45:00]  Joe Buck's  a really huge fan  so we'll just  play this  ok  Carlos Martinez  got through  the bottom  of the eighth inning  he's meeting  with his manager  and then as he  got down  to the end  of the dugout  it was a hug  from his pitching  coach  Derek Lilliquist  as Koji O'Hara  tanked silver  that was Pearl Jam  with their new  song Animal  as we go 
[01:45:30]  into the ninth inning  that was their  new song Animal  John Jay  he did say that  right  yeah  is at the plate  his base hit  Animal's about  20 years old  yeah just about  20  20 years old  holy shit  20 exactly  he's a big fan  though  big fan  he's a huge  fan of Pearl Jam  he says  there's real  I want to be  I want to be  I want to be  I want to be  I want to be  I want to be  I want to be  I want to be  for a new song  you really know that  yeah yeah  I think you secretly  like Pearl Jam 
[01:46:00]  I do  you know it too well  I like Pearl Jam  why don't you want to  admit that you like  Pearl Jam a little bit  I like Pearl Jam  I don't love Pearl Jam  okay  and you don't like  when he talks  no  you don't like  when he talks  I don't like  his dumb politics  I wasn't able  to even listen  to you two  for years  because of  his dumb politics  and you know  that gets annoying  after a while  it really does  I do agree with you  he's toned it down  in concert  I am  yeah  big time  he barely talked  when we went  to the Brooklyn show 
[01:46:30]  ten years ago  when like Bush  was still in office  it was  it was a lot  right  and now it's  kind of just like  you know  not a lot  you know  if he was that guy  though  then he would  make the ticket  a little cheaper  because he would  understand the struggle  of the people  I mean come on  right  well I mean  all of their tickets  are the same price  so  how much are they now  I think 75  but then after  service charges  it's like 90  something  service charges

[01:56:00]  oh my god  sex grooming world  i remember um  i was playing poker at the time  with dave herman  and uh  hold on  hold on  yeah  hold on with that bit  give me one second  all right  i haven't had a chance to tell that story yet on the radio this morning so nobody knows who dave  herman  that's crazy  but let me tell you something  this is in my head  dave herman  was one of my  one of the people i looked up to  when i was in philadelphia  you weren't the only one looking up to him  thank you  but anyway dave herman 
[01:56:30]  was this cool fm dj  and i don't want to tell you what decade  and today in the news  did you guys know about this before today  uh yeah yesterday  right when it broke  we were on it  we were talking chat rooms a lot  so i kind of assumed  this friggin dave herman  who used to turn me on to all the music  in the 60s and early 70s  moved on to be a big time dude in new york city  just arranged for a seven-year-old kid to get flown to  i forgot  san croix 
[01:57:00]  san croix  and she was six  oh she was seven now  she was six when they started  six years old  yeah  this is a level of sickness that i can't even understand  she looked 18  this dude  yeah  wanted to  wanted to do sex with a six-year-old  yeah  and got busted  yeah  he arranged uh  this whole thing with this uh  supposed mother of this  six-year-old girl  to uh  get together in jersey  and then that fell through  but apparently it was a cop on the other end  a homeland security agent  so they uh 
[01:57:30]  just collected evidence for just about a year  and uh  he finally was like  all right look i got a place in saint croix  we'll all fly down there  and uh  we'll meet at saint croix  so  he bought them tickets  he flew down in advance  and he  they got him  they arrested him  at the airport  waiting for this flight to come in  with this mother and uh  six-year-old kid  as he held a stuffed animal on his lap  uh  in the airport  waiting  waiting for them to arrive  and uh  uh  you're on regular radio  oh yeah 
[01:58:00]  yeah  thank you  thank you  thank you  he said that uh  he wouldn't hurt her  but he might  have to get forceful  and fire with alcohol  alcohol  it's just the sickest  story  this guy  was so twisted  and the problem  and i know what you're thinking  is  he's like  you just can't trust anyone online anymore  it's like  you gotta be so careful  these damn cops  but in the meantime  how sick do you  i mean i get the sex part of the sickness  but how sick and deranged do you have to be 
[01:58:30]  to think that a mother  is delivering her daughter for sex with a girl  some do  who believes  some do  plenty of them do  some do  yeah for drugs  hey look parents kill their kids  parents uh  yeah you're right  parents sell their kids  you know people are terrible  what am i talking about  that was stupid  he actually said that uh  girls that age  he finds them incredibly sexy  and yes  and that  that's the age  that they should  uh start  experience that type of love  i don't want to know  just uh 
[01:59:00]  good morning rochester  it's  it's  sorry  you know what it is  it's horrific to listen to  but you gotta realize  what type of monster  this guy really is  and we uh  we cross paths with the guy  at anyw  we never liked the guy  oh that's right  uh he was doing mornings  when we uh  landed at  wnew  and uh  we put his ex  did you take his gig  not really  did you take his job  we kind of took scott muni's gig  believe it or not  oh i forgot  scott muni was  scott muni was beyond cool to us 
[01:59:30]  but dave herman  not so much  we never liked the guy  we had his uh  ex-wife on the line  she was  she was calling him  all sorts of stuff  and then she was  hold on  hold on  i have to clarify for the audience  is dave herman a dj  hold on  what  yeah the guy's a dj  big dj  used to be  anyways  he's 77  hold on bro  you were doing afternoons  and he was on in the morning  and you actually had his wife  to motherhucker him  on the radio  while he was working  in the morning  it was uh  he might have  he might  yeah  there was a time  yeah  i guess so 
[02:00:00]  yeah there was some overlap there  there was some overlap  they were firing these guys  one at a time  so i'm not sure exactly  how it matched up  but very  certainly right around then  it's actually a really good story  so we get her on  he's  she's calling him  a deadbeat dad  she's doing a  a garage sale  with all his stuff  we sent our listeners there  and then uh  dave herman was so mad  at what we did  he sued us and the company  for 10 million dollars  and then  how'd he make out  uh  we won the lawsuit  because we knew what we were  zero  and uh  he had one of his guys  who works here at siriusxm 
[02:00:30]  i think to this day  wiretapping us  you know when  you guys are sitting around  uh  in between  going live  this guy  would be in the other studio  recording us  uh  waiting for us to say  some stuff  that he could use  in the lawsuit  yeah  i guess that didn't work  that's illegal  i know  well that's  when it came out  it was illegal  and they threw it out  of court or something  you can't  yeah i think  jim norton  today at the comedy club  yes  let me give the guy a play  sitting here suffering  on the wee show  jim norton's at the comedy club 
[02:01:00]  tonight and tomorrow night  two shows  7 30 and 10  and uh  jim norton  to this date  is the only guy  that ever sold out  the comedy club  in advance  and these joints  have been  25 years  oh wow  full of everybody  and so uh  go ahead  no no i'm sorry  i was just saying  tonight  i have a really new  stuff planned  i'm going to be reading  uh dave herman  uh chat transcripts  in cartoon voices  i'm going to break out  my uh

[02:02:00]  i don't know where  it was supposed to be  but like madison square  garden in a backstage  hallway right  you're the dane cook  i never saw the episode  of the dane cook episode  how do you not see the episode  i don't watch myself ever  for the same reason  most people don't  i have eyes and ears  and i recognize crap  when i see it  oh man  you know it's funny  that i will  it's a different level  but i won't listen to it  i don't want to hear my crap  on the radio at all  but see and i would  but anyway it's a great episode  it's a great friggin episode  i'm sure people have told you 
[02:02:30]  you know louie  that's what a psychotic louie is  that episode  that was supposed to be  a guy named todd barry  um because louie's friends  with him  and oh you know todd  and he was unable to do it  so louie called me  at six o'clock on a friday  on my old phone number  um because he's still  using my old phone  and he goes  hey man can you get  to the bronx by seven  or eight  and i'm like what  and he goes uh yeah  i need to shoot something  so he sent a car for me  and they took me  to the south bronx  to the wrong address  uh with two hours notice  and i shot that  that was just lucky to get in

[02:03:30]  yeah and he was like  there was no way  louie could talk him  out of it  and kind of knew  where that was going  but he's just really good  yeah and the problem  with doug though  is they had to try  to get him to be  happier than normal  for the role  they're like  doug you're too  so check this out  oh check this out  so i'm down to morning  show boot camp  and there are these  awards and stuff  oh boy  and scott shannon  yeah  was being so unbelievably  he was on a panel  with me too  which by the way  uh in a few minutes  maybe i'll tell you  the story that i killed

Anthony show  oh yeah  oh yeah  we got Lexi Love  still in studio  Bobo still in studio  oh yeah  and now we got  the pit bull of comedy  about to make his way  into the studio  for the first time  in a while  yeah bring Bobby in 
[02:46:00]  Halloween is just a week away  Bobby Slade  Bobby  here he comes  I'm coming  working his way in  I'm coming  I'm coming  oh man  would you bring some Danish  well what I did  what I did was  guys  it's been 15 years  since I've been on the show  and I want to apologize  or whatever  and I don't know  what I did  I don't think you did anything  nothing says hello  and thank you  and I'm sorry  more than cupcakes  cupcakes  also kind of gay  it is a little gay  it's all in the thought 
[02:46:30]  he just gave his props  for the next bit  one's got to go up  Bobo's hiney  what kind of cupcakes  you got  first of all  every time I come back  to New York  I'm always hoping  to do your show  I walk around this town  now is my imagination  or they're like  every three blocks  a cupcake store  yeah now it's like  the big thing  a cupcake kind of bakery  magnolias  you got the crumbs  yeah yeah  looks like Starbucks  and then a Verizon  and then a cupcakes  then an AT&T  and a cupcakes  by the way  so I know Chris B  this is a new Starbucks  oh boy  and they're skull  they're skull cupcakes 
[02:47:00]  what's that mean  oh very spooky  they got skulls on them  oh actual skull  Halloween  I thought it was kind of cool  I'm a big skull guy  you know when I got married  25 years ago  and I didn't know  Keith Richards did this too  and I like to think  I'm as cool  of course I'm not  but I got a skull  wedding ring  and I thought  Keith Richards did this before me  but now  every hot topic  every Kmart  every 9 year old  has skulls  they're not that hip anymore  yeah yeah  but skull cupcakes  if you gotta be  it's kind of gay  but then kind of cool  so it evens out  to regular  right it's normal now  as long as they taste good  who cares 
[02:47:30]  not too gay  not too cool  that's Lexi Love  just so you know  of course I'm a big fan  Lexi  of course I'm a big fan  anyway  I'm trying to be nice  so I walk  yeah you are  so I get here  a little bit early  and I go across  to the cupcake store  yeah  so there's a line  for cupcakes  and I'm not being a Jew  here by saying  they're 350  it's fine  it's not like the old days  with Hostess  oh no man  so I'm getting a cup of coffee  and then I go  I'd like a half a dozen cupcakes  and the woman says to me  well you gotta talk  to the cupcake lady  and I said  what do you mean  I'm in line here  and there's a line for cupcakes  a line for coffee 
[02:48:00]  I said why can't you  give me the cupcakes  that's like a different person  she's not trained  she's not trained in cupcakes  this is a different union  I'm not trying to be an asshole  I saved that for you guys  I said what I'm saying  I'm in line for coffee  the cupcakes are right there  are you gonna tell me  I have to get in a different cupcake line  that's ridiculous  but you know what it's like  it's like Subway  does the same thing  you walk in there  and you gotta talk  to the bread guy  it's like Snow White  and there's so many fucking retards  they're all back there  but they treat you  like you're an idiot  hey tell the first guy  what kind of bread you want  don't give him the whole order 
[02:48:30]  like that Scanners movie  and you got a toy  talk to each individual episode  yeah the meat guy  the cheese guy  how many people  are gonna touch my sandwich  what the fuck  can I get pickles  you know what  the pickle guy  he's dating the cupcake girl  and they went on the honeymoon  so fucked up  hi Lexi  how are you  I like that  good start for Bobby Slate  oh man  wait it gets better  it gets better  it gets better  about the cupcakes  my god  so the gluten free cupcake 
[02:49:00]  is another 25 cents  now wouldn't you think  by leaving out the gluten  they'd pass the savings  it'd be cheaper  no gluten  no gluten  go overhead  you're leaving out the ingredient  yes  and then the gluten free  sugar free  with another 50 cents  what if I don't want  a fucking cupcake  what is that 9 dollars  I don't even want a cupcake  an engine free car  would be cheaper  than a car with an engine  right  Lexi's loving you  what would be probably  like eating a cupcake  by the way  I got these cupcakes  I am gluten free 
[02:49:30]  are you gluten free  Lexi why  what happens when you eat gluten  oh what you got a gluten problem  everyone has a fucking gluten problem  no one had a gluten problem  10 years ago  or a peanut allergy  or a peanut allergy  what happens to her though  I want to know what happens  it's really painful  my joints swell  like I wake up feeling like  I have the flu the next morning  my joints swelling now  I must have a gluten problem  it takes me out for like  three days  if I eat something  with wheat in it  my lips swell  my eyes swell  and all my joints swell 
[02:50:00]  it's really great  prove it  okay I'm going to go  eat something  and come in here  one day you'll be like  you looks like hell  wow  you know Anthony's right  you know gluten  it's up there now  with black tar heroin  AIDS and breast cancer  it's killing more Americans  but what's amazing about it  you know what gluten is  it's flour and water  it makes pasta  it makes bread  nobody in Italy  has ever died from gluten  that country should be called  glutally  nobody's got a problem  in glutally  from the goddamn gluten  Bobby  Bobby we bring this up  because we're older gentlemen  when we were growing up 
[02:50:30]  there were no allergies  there was no gluten free shit  you had a kid that had asthma  that was about it  but they weren't dropping dead  because they ate a peanut  a peanut  so what the hell's going on  out there now  let me tell you something though  why is Bobo raising his fucking hand  raise your hand Bobo  Robo  what I was  what I was going to say  is that I think it's  I think it's the same theory  like if you grow  if you grow up with the  with dogs in the house  from the moment you're born  you don't have the dog allergies  so I think you got to start  having them eat the stuff  while they're young 
[02:51:00]  I know I recognize you  you're the lettuce guy  at Subway aren't you  you know what  he's the lettuce guy  nah  I ain't the lettuce guy  by the way  you almost got bumped today  for him  I know  I think this will be  the first time pal  holy shit  but here's what's interesting  my wife  you said the peanut allergy  you know I was on a plane  a few months ago  and there weren't certain peanuts  this kid had a peanut allergy  and it was so bad  I guess if you open up the peanuts  and the fumes  the dust  the dust  but my wife  when I married her  told me this 25 years ago  said she had a peanut allergy 
[02:51:30]  we never heard about this  she goes  there can be no peanuts  in the house  years later  she said peanut allergy  they gave me no peanuts  oh see  oh  now it all makes sense  now I get it  it's amazing how big a difference  from a little misunderstanding  like that it makes sense  but yeah  just so you know what's going on  we went old school today  we don't do these type of bits  as much  but we had Lexi Love  naked  giving Bobo  a sponge bath  a sponge bath  now we have cupcakes  now we have cupcakes  well now we want to shove one up  Bobo's butt  Jesus  that would be the grand finale 
[02:52:00]  of the week Bobo  will you allow us to do that  I want one  but do one of the white ones  not the chocolate ones  I saved those for being in  yeah yeah  yeah one of those  wow that's really  a lot of cream on those  they look amazing  Lexi have one  I can't  well you can have the icing  that is probably  oh  oh there's no  I got my dick washed  by this lovely lady  I wish more people  would say that about me  yes  I'd be happy to say that  Bobby doesn't miss a trip 
[02:52:30]  I'd be happy to say that  you know  this is really funny  I don't  I don't give a plug  to my gig tonight  but I gotta tell you  it was 15 years ago  it was in 1998  it was the last time  I did your show  when you're on regular radio  and the reason I remember it  is because  I was doing this  Rat Pack movie  with Ray Liotta  right  how did that work out  you were Joey Bishop  yeah  and Anthony said  something really funny  which made 15 years ago  that's right  15 years  it's my anniversary  but what was interesting 
[02:53:00]  I was  not only was I on your show  15 years ago this month  it was the first time  I was playing the brokerage  the governors of the brokerage  it was also 15 years ago  this month  and I think it was 15 years ago  this month  was the last time  my wife blew me  so it's kind of  a trifecta  I did today  and instead of  recapturing the blowjob  you're recapturing  the brokerage  yeah  you ever get  your dick washed  by a chick like this  oh  well not today  I could do that myself  you know  I have bigger fantasies 
[02:53:30]  than having my dick washed  I could do that  after I have the hooker  I shoot to the stars  right Bobo  you know  getting your dick washed  to you it's a big thing  right  to us it's called a shower  yeah  to us it was a sideshow  yeah yeah yeah  you're okay Bobo  but to Bobo it was everything  yeah  I'm glad you were happy about it Bobo  we had your pal Weez on  a little while ago  you were Weez  because to Norton's  playing up there  well Weez was responsible  for getting us back together  yes  you know with the brother  by the way I just saw Norton  in the elevator  when he was coming up  and you know he was a guy 
[02:54:00]  I'm kind of proud of him  you guys  well you know how much  you love the guy  but he was the guy  that it was 20 years ago  he was opening up for me  this is another gay thing  how gay was this  we were playing some  defunct club up in New Paltz  and we had nothing to do  during the day  and we took a little walk  to an apple orchard  so that was a pretty gay thing  wow that's  because Norton doesn't do  things like that usually  I know  not anymore  he must have really liked you  no yes  hooker isn't  you're an Asian  see Bobo we've graduated  to higher things  and I've known  Dick's washed  how much of a nothing  is there to do here  town were you in 
[02:54:30]  that taking a walk  in an apple orchard  was the big thing  well it was a big thing  with Norton  that was really  but you know what it was  it's so funny  because I finally  I saw him the other night  at the comedy salon  it's just amazing  what a great comic  he's turned into  there's so many guys  that opened up for me  in the old days  I'd have a chapter  in my book  Jon Stewart  David Spade  Roseanne  you know Ray Romano  you know I'm like  Typhoid Mary  she's never had typhoid  when she carried the gene  I never became famous  but people who come  in contact  I guarantee you  he'll be on the Tonight Show 
[02:55:00]  he'll be hopeful  before I get back  Bobo's good  but Bobo got his dick washed  yeah yeah  it's very important  I need to get me a whore  yeah  what happened  no I need to get me a whore  give me  oh no  no really  he's a virgin  he's never had sex  with a girl or anything  and he's given us  one of the greatest moments  ever on the show  he gets hard instantly  but then you start  talking about the Mets  and it goes down instantly  oh really  it's the most bizarre thing ever  let me give you  one piece of advice  if you do get a hooker  because here's where 
[02:55:30]  they rip you off in New York  they'll charge you more  for the gluten free pussy  don't go for it  don't go for it  get the regular pussy  don't go for that gluten free  it's kind of good though  sometimes you don't want  swollen nasty  rashy pussy  so I think Bobo  I got big balls  so I'll be fine  yeah we understand  we saw him  that's fantastic  unfortunately we saw him today  I want one of those cupcakes  I want those balls  I have to wait  until after the show though  yeah it's kind of hard to do it  the audience gets a little mad  when you're eating  on the air 
[02:56:00]  and we haven't seen you  in 15 years  if you're holding a grudge  they could be poisoned  he's going to see how this goes  and then like  we should tell me  that your daughter's  taking off too  we had a whole conversation  about you the other day  you know he said  do you talk about it  well I called him up  and I said look  I want to get back  on the opening  show  let me put a call  to the guys  and tell them  see you know  my daughter Natasha  who got into showbiz  when she was nine  as a matter of fact  when she got into showbiz  I had a big fight  on the air  with a big nose Jew  down the hall  and I haven't been back  on the show  in a long time 
[02:56:30]  I don't want to mention  any names  you can figure it out  we all know he's an asshole  trust me  that should get me  back on here next time  okay I'm done with that  now I've accomplished  my thought  there's no surprise there  but you know what  my daughter got to showbiz  when she was nine years old  and I didn't want  to do it to her  I was like  I did a great story  she's now a pussycat though  where um  and oh now I see  I don't start getting excited  Bobo relax  Bobo  just focus on Lexi  okay  when my daughter  was nine  Tom Arnold had a show  called the Tom Show  on the WB 
[02:57:00]  and it was Tom Arnold  it was Shannon Tweed  you know  Jim Cesar's wife  and Ed McMahon  Johnny Carson's late  sidekick  so I was like  a semi-regular  on the show  it was a sitcom  so being a semi-regular  I had a dressing room  in the parking lot  with the janitorial supplies  it was a little teeny  horrible little room  like when you have to wait  for the opening  Anthony show  right in that little room  down the hall  right  broken toilet  piece of shit  solitary  confined movie  Steve McQueen  from  the fucking cooler  so here's the great thing  so my daughter says 
[02:57:30]  daddy I really want to do this  and my wife goes  we can't put her in showbiz  because you hear these  horrible showbiz stories  about children  but you never hear about  the kids that go on  to college  or become adult stars  we had one in yesterday  Ron Howard  he came in yesterday  he's a perfect example  there you go  the chance of that happening  it's like the line  so I said  so what  so she becomes a train wreck  she's probably going to  become a train wreck  anyway  be it my daughter  living in LA  going to public school  nothing's going to work out  in her life  so anyway  I said okay fine  we'll get you  we'll get you an agent  two weeks later  the Tom Arnold show 
[02:58:00]  gets cancelled  her show  she gets an ABC series  she goes on the same set  but now she's a regular  next to  giant dressing room  shower  bedroom  living in a parking space  with a name on it  and she's nine  okay  what show is this  it was called  Brothers Keeper  it was on for two seasons  but she never acted before  I remember the name  sure  you know  it was a show  it was on a regular sitcom  prime time  but the one thing  that was great  being a dad  and I'm not one of these guys  likes to reminisce  to get too nostalgic  every Friday night  if I wasn't on the road  what I would do is 
[02:58:30]  they'd do a dress rehearsal  they'd have dinner  they'd have an hour  before they brought  in the live studio audience  so we would take a walk  to the psycho house  they'd already shut down  the tour of Universal  and her and I  would get ice cream  and we'd sit at  Norman Bates' house  and we'd go over her lines  until security kicked us out  and if they did  we'd walk to the Frankenstein cell  and I would say to my daughter  and I  see this is where  the father carried  the dead girl Maria  through the  we're sitting there  this is where the dick  and we'd watch the movie  and it was just kind of cool  that is pretty cool man  yeah yeah  but now she's a pussycat doll  and now she's a pussycat doll  but they're reinventing  that band I think 
[02:59:00]  yeah I never hear from her again  I don't think they're called  a pussycat doll  they're called girl  they're called GRL  and they got Britney Spears  manager  which I could use right now  all the help I could get  but they're  and they still  you know  fight crime  and dress like hookers  they have a change  they're no different  than the pussycat doll  they reinvented  but it's the same people  they sing  and they dress like hookers  which is fine  right Lexi?  you bet  of course  that's great  yeah  that is pretty goddamn cool  so you gotta be a proud pompa  Bobo is DTF  oh boy  what Bobo  what's that?  Bobo is DTF 
[02:59:30]  you don't have to talk about Bobo  in third person  you can  what's DTF?  what's that?  I've never heard of that  not sure what it means  just heard it before  okay  he doesn't know what it means  he heard it before  you don't know what that means?  you just know it was the thing  to say in the middle of nowhere?  god I thought I could bring  the show to withstand  so thank you Bobo  thank you  Bobo you really are  like putting the brakes  on the show today  I was just trying to get  my dick wet  now you're trying to get  wet?  his dick wet 
[03:00:00]  it just was wet  you were in the bath  she washed you  it was great  I'm sorry I missed that  don't worry about it  yeah that was  that's why the movie  Dinner for Schmucks  didn't work  you gotta use real schmucks  yeah exactly  we're gonna do it  we're gonna like  just fill the studio  with schmucks  and just let them  do their thing  well we gotta find more  other than  oh Lady Di  yeah  oh that's true  they're terrible people  when my daughter  became that pussycat  she moved out of the house  she finally  she gets a record deal  with RCA  and I come home  about two months ago  in my office  which I never use  I have a drum set down there 
[03:00:30]  I never play it anymore  it sounded like a good idea  when I got it  I don't know  I can't play these  goddamn things  so I never go down  to my office  so my wife goes  by the way  one of the girls  she got kicked out  of an apartment  she needs to move in  and she'd move it  into your office  my wife kind of told me  this  she said you know  we can use the money  so she moves in  with this Pomeranian  which is even gayer  than Cupcake  so like a little gay  round marshmallow dog  so my dog moves out  none of these girls  moves in  and now  they'll come over  to the house once in a while  they're all 25  if you look at them  you don't have to do it now  GRL  and they're really really hot 
[03:01:00]  and they'll come over  and my wife will look at me  like  you know  it's like when my daughter  was 17 or 18  she was singing  and her friends would come over  and it's not like  I'm Dave Herman  you know  I'm sure you guys  talked about that  this morning  you know  I don't want to go  into it again  but when I woke up  this morning  I said  I'm so happy  about being back  on your show  I want to talk about stuff  I'm going to get  these guys cupcakes  and I picked up  the paper guys  and it was so  I mean  you guys  are old enough  you grew up  on the Long Island  you had a shirt  you were in love  with Dave Herman 
[03:01:30]  WDW  we worked  alongside him  for a little bit  he was always an asshole  was he really?  yeah  we never liked the guy  I'm an asshole  I'm sure I liked the guy  that chance  stands out  no no  this is  he sued us  for 10 million dollars  it's a long story  he didn't win  he didn't win  I want to hear about it  off the show  no we talked  about it  but it was probably  one of the sickest things  I've ever read  in the newspaper  I don't know  if you get sicker  well it's interesting  though  this morning  I get coffee  and I'm picking up  the daily news  I'm seeing this  about Dave Herman  again a guy  who all the music 
[03:02:00]  I grew up with  the Beatles  the Stones  he'd break on  WDW  was one of the  groundbreaking radio stations  in the country  before BAB  they were amazing  and you read this  but then  I'm waiting for you guys  in the lobby  and I'm reading  the post  and it said the girl  was 7  which of course  is different  if she's 6  but 7  I'm sure he's using  that as an argument  what else could you  possibly say  she wasn't 6  it's like  there's no defense  of that  are there black girls  in GRL 
[03:02:30]  yeah there's one black girl  and the bald one  she's the one  that lives in my house  with the Pomeranian  they're really cute  aren't they  beautiful girls  which one is your daughter  the blonde  I don't know  what picture you're looking at  the hula hoop  she's cute  I can't call her hot  she's my daughter  you think I can see that  from here  are you kidding me  what color hair does she have  brown  long brown hair  big pouty lips  I think she's got  that from her gluten allergy  this is your daughter  I don't know  they just keep pumping  gluten in her  that's your daughter  that's my little girl 
[03:03:00]  my little girl  which one  the one that dresses  like all the way  but they fight crime  I think my daughter  is the one that turns  I'm not sure  if she turns invisible  or turns herself into fire  they don't have  different powers  they don't really talk  to me about this  it's supposed to be  under the radar  I probably should have  mentioned that  you got any  any wifi cams  in that office of yours  where you can  you know  here's what's really  kind of creepy  a friend of mine  calls me up  he produces a show  on Nickelodeon  he calls me up  he says  Bobby my daughter  eight years old  is a big fan 
[03:03:30]  of this band girl  he says to me  when they play LA  because they're going to be  I think like the next  Spice Girls  I think  and I hope so  because my career  I got nothing  fellas  I got nothing fellas  if I don't pack  governance tonight  at the brokerage  I'm screwed  and McGuire's tomorrow  okay anyway  so he calls me up  because my eight year old  daughter really  wants to get tickets  I said  I got something better  I'm off for two weeks  why don't you have  I'll have all the girls  come over  I'll see if I can  wrangle them over  you're about to go on tour  I'll have a little  swim party at the house  I'll make pizza  I love to make pizza 
[03:04:00]  I'll have them come over  what a self-serving prick  you are  he just wants to make sure  they have a good time  Anthony  Anthony you're wrong  he just wants them  to have a good time  what's wrong with that  I did it for the eight year old  yes of course  it wasn't quite  Make-A-Wish Foundation  you're going to make pizza  I'm a great pizza maker  oh yeah  so the girls come over  my wife's out of town  which has nothing to do  I don't know  I don't know why  I brought that up  they all come over  we have a little swim party  and they're all very pretty  but again  they're friends of my daughters  I have something to say 
[03:04:30]  I guess you realize  stuff still works  you don't have a dysfunction  when you realize  those girls walk in  let me tell you something  I'm 58 years old  okay  I have no problem  I'm not even sure  what he said  I don't know either  this is beyond me  I don't know why  we're torturing like this  it's been 15 years  then you gotta do that  but it's okay  I deserve it  he knows when to pipe in though  that's what I like about Bobo  yeah he's perfectly timed  right at the end of the story  you had the great punchline there 
[03:05:00]  and then he popped in  it was coming up  and I said I wasn't ready  but you know what he reminds me of  is my wife  because I'm about to come  did you walk the dog  you said you were going to buy milk  did you buy milk  and he's just like my wife  you're kind of cute  he doesn't even know  what I'm talking about  your wife is out of town  you're making the pizza  they're in their bikinis  they're in their bikinis  oh man  but they're your daughter's friends  which makes it creepy  but they're my daughter's friends  it's the same thing  when my wife  when my daughter was 17 or 18  you look at some of her friends  and my women like to remind you 
[03:05:30]  she's your daughter's age  but I don't think about my daughter  when I look at young pussy  and I try to explain that to my wife  I look at old pussy  I don't think about you  I drive by the Statue of Liberty  hey  I better call home  you know it's not  you and my daughter  have nothing to do with my fantasy of pussy  I need my dick washed right now  and a cupcake in my ass  dick washed and a cupcake  but pussy is pussy  am I right  what  but pussy is pussy  am I right  no  no  you're a virgin  you want to know  no  and it's not  there's you know  to you yes  yeah 
[03:06:00]  to you  it's like you're on Gilligan's Island  a coconut  a lobster  whatever you can find to eat  a palm fronk  in your situation  pussy is pussy  paid for  imaginary  in your little world  this is the day to have his wife's pussy  just be happy with whatever you can get  and then you can work up to our level  right  where we actually have  or have had  good pussy  don't try to be us  different types  you know  you're like a young rock star  that watches Keith Richards  and go I'm going to shoot heroin  and then do a  no you can't  and then he's dead  yeah  and then you're dead  you gotta know  how to prolong that career  a little something else  yeah  you've just barely got your dick washed today 
[03:06:30]  right  well at least my dick is clean  yeah there you go  it wasn't before  there's an upside to it  yeah  don't you love  you like that too right  it was  it was rather  arousing and interesting  I mean  I've never done that before  in the realm of all the penis  you've probably seen  in your day  as far as size goes  where do you put that  and what you've seen  um  one being  one inch  ten being ten  he's got a little nub 
[03:07:00]  he's got a nub  it's maybe this  poor little nub  what do you think  is it literally the smallest penis  you've ever seen  it's not the smallest  wow  wow  it's not the smallest  is it asian style  it is asian style  now you see a lot of asian penises right  yeah  now I haven't  now is that a stereotype  I know they can't try  well actually  japanese men  have pretty big penises  what  chinese men have small penises  i think so  that's how you tell them apart  because I always  tell you it's called apart  hey look at his dick  because people can't tell 
[03:07:30]  japanese  are you chinese or japanese  but I guess it really  is that  I did a scene once  with a japanese man  and I was like  whoa  I was like  that's pretty big  wow  can I show you  what a pussy I am  and how loyal I've been  to my wife  I hosted  before norton did it  before you know  porn awards  I hosted the porn awards  for like four years  the first comic to do it  you know the late great  bill hicks had been on it  I think richard belzer  had been on it  I hosted it  what a coincidence  type jerked off  to the porn awards  really what is that  I'm surprised you  jacked off to the scarecrow 
[03:08:00]  I love him  he's jumping right in  jump right in  this guy's a regular  johnny carson  you need like a rape show  never mind jimmy fallon  you're the next big  he's the guy  I'm loving this  I know you guys  didn't do this to me  on purpose  no we wouldn't do that  Bobby  no no no  not Bobby  you work extra hard  no of course not  you're doing great  so porn awards  first comic  first time I host

[03:09:00]  some friend by the way  well no he had changed his number  when did he change his number  and not give it to you  that's not nice  well same as I've been on your show  for 50 years  people try to avoid me  I don't know what I do  you know how many cupcakes  I had to give him  to get his number  you know the person  who would give me cupcakes  they work every time  fair enough  cupcakes work every time  fair enough  wow  thank you  this guy's quick  so  so  so  so she says to me  she goes  you know I have backstage passes  you know because  she's friends  with  feel free to jump at any time  actually you know what Bobo

[03:11:30]  with my wife  I actually feel like  I'm cheating on my hand  oh yeah yeah  that's a joke for you Bobo  take that Bobo  take that with you  no no  coke a lot  it usually made it  a little more difficult  to get a rod  but once you did  it was there  as your pal all night  right  yeah  so we're leaving  and I'm horny as hell  and we're in the limo  and she drops me up  from my hotel  and gives me  this kind of look  like okay Mr. Bond  what now  I give her a kiss  on the cheek  I leave  I go to my room  I get a Heineken  and a burger  and I just said to myself  how whipped am I  how pissed  my wife's not even here 
[03:12:00]  and I just did  blow with a porn star  lifetime achievement award  I think she wanted  to come up  and I didn't do anything  that would have completed  the story  of course  I never told my wife  that story  I'm writing a book  which I hope  finish the next 15 years  when I come out  it should be done by that  it's called  my 35 years  and show up as hell  and at least 40  when it comes out  but I'm letting my wife  read a couple of chapters  about how I got in a  fight with Journey  how Alice Cooper saved my life  I'll save these stories  for next time  I want to hear the Journey story 
[03:12:30]  oh the Journey story  you gotta tell one of these stories  before you leave  but go ahead  the Gong show  I was on the regional  Gong show  anyway  so my wife's reading the chapters  and I have the story  about the AVN awards  the adult video news awards  and she says  you never told me  you went backstage  with her  I said  but I would think  my wife would be happy  that I'm backstage  doing blow  with a woman who won  the Lifetime Achievement Award  and being the good husband  I came back to my room  and this fucking broad  she's mad  she's still mad at you  at the story  that led up to where  you should have fucked her  and I didn't  oh man  so you might as well  have done it 
[03:13:00]  I might as well have done it  you're in the same trouble  you know what  my first girlfriend  my first major girlfriend  before I met my wife  27 years ago  we went out for about 5 years  and I could not have been  a better boyfriend  and then whenever I was  on the road  playing at club  whether it was  Governors of Long Island  tonight at the Brokerage  or tomorrow night  at the McGuire's  it doesn't matter where it is  they're trying to plug it  I'm gonna get that  one more time  before Bobo  tells another great story  so yeah  excuse me  thank you Bobo  what did you say  what did you say  I just said  I just tweeted this shit

[03:14:00]  breakdowns  who make me look  like such a asshole  I never been back  on the Opie and Anthony  network  but I didn't know  I brought that up  cause I like Patrice  but he pulled a number  on me once  and it was funny  actually  but anyway  so  Fez is my nigga  what?  Fez is my nigga  don't talk shit  about Fez  I can see  what you'd like  Fez  if anybody  can take his place  if anybody  if Fez  actually  if they ever  put him away  permanently  I could see  you know  it's almost like  Darren on Beware  where he can take  that place  wait what's your 
[03:14:30]  twitter  I'm trying to find  it  it's Pitbull of Comedy  you know what  it's Pitbull of Comedy  and I  you know what  that was from  1980s  when  you know  this Pitbull thing  that's another  stupid story  I should really  change that  but I've had that  nickname  the Pitbull of Comedy  since the 80s  but it's like  get rid of a mullet  you know  do you honestly  think I want to be  opiate this age  I got the name  at 12  so I get it  now I don't feel so bad  no I get it  but we can't change  the branding  at this point  I hate the fucking name 
[03:15:00]  Rod Howard  must have brought it up  how much he hates  yeah we talked about  how much he hates  people to  when they bring up  both people  yeah yeah  but you know  it's something to be proud of  I'm stuck with  the nickname Bobo  for life  well you deserve Bobo  that is a perfect name  for you  Rod Forrest  you should be Bobo  I'm following you  and I'll follow you guys  I'm following you right now  see we're back together  thank you  back together  all right  you got time  I have nowhere to go fellas  I'm working tonight  at 9  I'd love to hear what  happened with Journey  do you have to take a break 
[03:15:30]  or can we talk  tonight at 9  and the show soon  but you can stay  until 11 with Sam  I got nothing to do  good old Sam Roberts  yes  Journey  yeah look  I was never a Journey fan  and that's  probably your fans  are going to hate me  for this  but in the 80s  I never liked them  I was more of a  Rolling Stones  rock  whatever  the Ramones  the New York Dolls  there were a lot  of different camps  back then  of course  Lucas Costello  wasn't a Journey fan  so in the Bay Area  they used to have  something called  the Bammies  the Bay Area Music Awards  which was like  the Grammys  but it was all  Bay Area Musicians  and it was big 
[03:16:00]  and it got bigger  and bigger over the years  but in the Bay Area  there's only so many  people you can give  awards to  for best guitar player  it's going to be  Santana or maybe  Neil Schoen  for the best band  it's going to be  the Airplane  the Dead  or the Doobie Brothers  gets old after a while  there was Tower Power  Eddie Money  you know  Huey Lewis  I mean from the 70s  from the 60s  the cleanest dick  goes to Bobo  oh Bobo  you're still here  wait what did you say Bobo  the cleanest dick  goes to Bobo  the cleanest dick  goes to Bobo  that's pretty clever though  you gotta admit  that one was clever  that was great 
[03:16:30]  it was a good tie  into your story  well yes  you don't want to  give him too much credit  or encourage him  too much  but you know what though  he's making me miss Fez  let me tell you one thing  you just named a lot of bands  that came out of San Francisco  that's pretty impressive  well you know what  I mean  Eddie Money I thought  was a Long Island guy though  well he was  he was a cop  and he was a New York City cop  his whole family  Eddie Mahoney  they were all cops  went to the Bay Area  started a band  we used to do a lot of drugs together  and he was one of the few guys  who could do drugs  and then arrest the members  of his band  because Long Island 
[03:17:00]  we have what  Twisted Sister  Billy Jolt  Pat Benatar  and maybe Eddie Money  well New York though  you know is a big  place for music  as is Chicago  for the blues  but San Francisco  it might not be London  with the Kings  and the Stones  and the Beatles  but it was  pretty impressive though  from the 60s to the 80s  and I used to open up  for you Lewis  and I used to open up  for Eddie Money  and I remember  I opened up  for the Stranglers  a punk band from England  oh how'd that go  how do you think it went  how do you think it went  not well  you know Dana Carvey 
[03:17:30]  Kevin Pollack  and Robin Williams  would  we all start out together  and you don't see them  on the Opie and Anthony show  Kevin does  we love Kevin  we're actually friends  with Kevin now  Kevin's great  but he  are you in his movie  I'm in his movie  no way  yeah  in fact I let him  come over to my house  and I'm on this  I'm on with  and Andy Kindler came over  you know Andy  does he do your show  oh Lunatic  no  one of the great comics  you guys would love  but anyway  so Pollack  and all those guys  would open up  for like the Beach Boys  Pablo Cruz  you know  Cub Scouts  and so Bill Graham 
[03:18:00]  had this club  and they paid the comics  50 bucks  to open up for a band  and I was getting to be  oh I'm Mr. Hotshot  comedian  Mr. San Francisco  I'm opening up  for McDeville  and Tower of Power  and Ray Charles  so the Stranglers  come from England  and that's when  Punk, the Dead Boys  and Dictators  and I  being the ass  I go  yeah 50 bucks  open up for them  and it wasn't a matter  of doing well  it was a matter of  staying on that bull  you know you're going to get  thrown off  how long can I stay on  and when you look at  people in the audience  who had neck tattoos  before it was cool  and piercings in their cheek 
[03:18:30]  and you go  if that guy's going to do it  to himself  what's he going to do to me  what is that guy  going to do to me  it was a nightmare  but before I tell you  the security story  Bill Graham calls me up  you know the late great  I love that guy  you know he was great  and he had the Fillmores  the Rolling Stones  in 1981 I think  they were doing a tour  George Thurgood  and the Destroyers  are opening up  for the Stones  and I love the Stones  and I love George Thurgood  so you know  you hear these stories  about the Stones  every tour  maybe doing a club date  to get all warmed up  for the big appearance  okay  so I'm thinking 
[03:19:00]  they're going to play  the small 300 seat club  for Bill Graham  you know  it's Mick Jagger's birthday  the Stones are off  they're in San Francisco  I got to go see the Stones  I get a call from Bill  Bobby you better come down  to the club  we need you to do something  you know what you want  to talk to me about  on the phone  what do you need me to do  he goes  we need you to open up  for the Stones  and I'm going  I'm going to die  this is going to be death  who's opening  for the Stones  but this is what's  really frightening  the stage  didn't have a curtain  it was just the band  and you know  the road he's going up there  he said well  not only do you have to  open up for the Stones  but George Thorogood 
[03:19:30]  is going to open the show  now not only can a comic  not open up for the Stones  you can't follow George Thorogood  so you were in between  Thorogood and  Patrice and Lenny Bruce  and Richard Pryor  came back to life  into one person  oh what  what's that Bobo  anyone notice  how nice Lexi's ass  looks today  I'll be  you owe me  another return visit  after this  I just want to  make this even better  for the listeners  this is something  we probably would do  but we're not doing this  we're not doing notes 
[03:20:00]  or anything  this is unbelievable  I know  but if you did do it  Bobo you're killing today  anyway go ahead  but if you did do it  it's okay  right  if anybody can handle this  it makes it way better  that we're not doing this  he is just sitting here  yeah  I'm laughing  so George Thorogood  you can't follow  George Thorogood  you gotta go on  before the Stones  so they tell me  you're gonna follow  George Thorogood  which is impossible enough  but when Thorogood finishes  the roadies are gonna  go up on stage  and keep in mind  there's no curtain  so while they're  changing out the equipment  for a small stage  while they're taking  off the equipment 
[03:20:30]  and bringing on  the Stones equipment  you have to go on  now  I like to think  after 35 years  of doing this  I'm an accomplished comedian  but nobody could do this now  let alone 20 years  30 years ago  so I'm freaking out guys  I have never freaked out  so much in my life  and I go down to the club  and I'm shaking  I mean I am shaking  I had props back then  I had a Pillsbury Doughboy  I had these two  I didn't want to tell you  what I was doing back then  my wife's having a yeast infection  I found her  fucking this Pillsbury Doughboy  it was brutal stuff  the gong show  would have turned me down  I got props  these nuts  what?  I got props  exactly Bobo 
[03:21:00]  that was my next line  that's exactly what  I was gonna say  what he's even saying  Jenny  I like you  wash my dick Jenny  okay  have some chocolate  I hope he's having a great day  it's your show  feel free  I get down to the club  and Bill says to me  Keith has a hangover  he cancelled the show  so I didn't have to do it  I wish there was a punchline  it probably would have been  but I forgot it  because of Bobo  it might have been a fun thing  you know  in hindsight  you know  at the time  it would have been petrifying  but it's like 
[03:21:30]  yeah I opened for the fucking stones  saying it now  would have been fine  30 years later  oh I went through chemo  it wasn't that bad  I lost my family  I didn't drug addiction  but I found Jesus  looking back  it was all fun  I learned  I learned a lot  point taken  there's a short list  of rock stars  that would freak me  the fuck out  and one is Mick Jagger  and Weez took me  backstage in Syracuse  right  and Mick Jagger  came up to talk  to John Sher  and me and Weez  were there  I felt like  I wasn't even worthy  to say hi  I was out of my mind  I'm like  is that Mick Jagger 
[03:22:00]  just standing right next  to us like this  those two guys  Mick and Keith  and again  they're like four feet tall  but to me  and before I tell you  the journey story  I'm backstage  at a Stones concert  a friend of mine  worked for the band  and my daughter  was 11 or 12  so it was  whatever it was  20 something  10, 15 years ago  so Mick Jagger  is standing there  and the Stones  are literally  about to go on  and my daughter  who just started singing  getting this  singing Pussycat Doll  thing  I said oh my god  it's Mick Jagger  and I would never do this  I said Mick  excuse me  my daughter Natasha 
[03:22:30]  but he's just standing  by himself  with his bodyguard  I think I'm  Hot Tub Johnny  and he was standing there  and I said  my daughter Natasha  is a singer  and just dying to meet you  and he could have been  nicer  go hello Natasha  nice to meet you  good luck with your career  and he walks away  I'm like you  I'm sitting there  going  holy shit  it's Mick Jagger  and I say to my kid  how cool was that  she says  well it's not like  it's Britney Spears  oh no  she didn't really see it  yes  yeah  that's the mindset  how sad is that  but she was like that  and when I did  the movie Ed Ward  Britney Spears  is a hot mess  yes exactly 
[03:23:00]  why do I play the song  and the record  keeps skipping  I don't know  and we can turn  his mic off  at any time  you know that Bobby  right  you can just give him  a cupcake  that's true  you want a cupcake  you want a cupcake  Bobo  I'll take  one cupcake  yeah yeah  no no no  Bobo don't touch it  pass him one cupcake  Lexi  don't mess up  the cupcake thing  just give him one  there you go 
[03:23:30]  can you touch  the cupcake  without getting  the gluten poison  I mean I don't know  I washed his penis  already today  so I think I can  touch the cupcake  yeah  how bad is your  allergy that the  cupcakes are worse  than Bobo's penis  well you know  it's like you're  building up a tolerance  by touching his penis  it's almost like  when that mad cow  disease was going on  you couldn't eat steak  I was in Canada  doing the nasty show  which I wish I would  have seen you guys  this past  I wish I would have  made up with you guys  before that  oh man  I was hosting the nasty show  but we never had a problem  I don't even know 
[03:24:00]  what happened  who cares  you know what  let's blame Bobo  and put it behind us  I have not been on the show  for 50 years  because of Bobo  now you want to talk  he's busy  yeah yeah  how's the cupcake Bobo  it tastes even better  after getting my  after the fact  I got in the bath  from this lovely lady here  oh wow  you are just a fucking  you got away with words  there Bobo  I'm sorry  I probably  put the  yeah  yeah  alright  can't you send  something to the Jew 
[03:24:30]  down the hall  send them over to Howard  okay anyway  I forgot a gift for you  happy birthday  here you go  give Robo  and send them down the hall  anyway  so  yeah  that may account  disease  but you do build up  a tolerance to stuff  because I was eating  rare steak  and the whole thing  was going on in Canada  but again  if they're going down  to my wife  for 25 years  you get the antibodies  and you can build up  a tolerance  like getting a shingle shot  I can't get salmonella  my wife's a giant  has carried everything  I feel like Superman  yeah  I want to know  what happened with Journey  oh so Journey 
[03:25:00]  okay  never mind Big Jagger  but Keith Richards  that was one time  I was speechless  let me tell you that  when my first CD came out  I dedicated  to Keith Richards  he's called Raging Bullie  1997  backstage at a  Stones concert  Keith is there  with Rodney Wood  they're playing like  Snooker or whatever  that pool like game  and his manager  comes up  because you want to meet Keith  and I said yeah  and Keith Richards  comes up  and I said  I'm Bobby Slade  I'm a comedian  I dedicated my CD to you  and Keith goes  why would you do that  and I was like  I was like  I'm speechless  oh yeah  hold on 
[03:25:30]  what  we thought if we give him  a cupcake  that would shut him up  he ate that fucking thing  in two seconds  Bobo I thought you were  going to the gym  it was a good cupcake  I hope so  it cost four bucks  what were you going to say  Keith is like  put the hair  alright  Journey  I'm okay  I don't want you to go  I don't think  there's a great punchline  to this story  but it's still fun  but what was the problem  with Journey  here was the problem  so I'm hosting this show  there's 10,000 people out there  Bay Area Music Awards  and everybody was there  to see the Doobie Brothers 
[03:26:00]  were reuniting  I think the airplane  or Starship at the time  when they sucked  and Journey was there  and they were winning  all these awards  because like I said  Carla Santana  would be best guitar player  and Journey's up front  there's a lesbian record company  at the time  they had women's music  whatever the hell that is  called Olivia Records  and I did some joke  about women's music  about the records  having no holes  I don't know what it was  but there were 10 angry lesbians  like there's any other kind  so they're giving me shit  and they start hissing  right away things aren't good  so I'm on stage  and I said something 
[03:26:30]  and I meant this  in the nicest way  about Journey  now you've got to remember  10,000 music fans  a couple of music industry people  and all the rock and roll stars  that we have in the Bay Area  so I said something  about Journey  and the joke was  you know  this Journey  with all due respect  do they have to win  best black blues artists  because I'm saying  they're winning every award  so it wasn't really  making fun of them  why are they winning  best blues  right yeah  so Journey  they're so stupid  Neil Shonan and Steve Perry  and they're drunk  they start throwing  champagne corks at me  now being a comic  and I'm trying to handle 
[03:27:00]  this whole audience  don't start fucking with me  you know  don't stop believing me  go bobo  go  that's what the whole audience  is full of bobo's  those are Journey fans  don't stop believing  don't stop believing  9,000 of those  believing  9,000 of those  assholes in the audience  I walk backstage  and Grace Slick  and Paul Candor  and all these guys  they also hate Journey  and they say  you're going to take  that shit from your show  and I'm doing more coke  and it was like  you never got me down Ray  so I walk back out there  and Journey's booing  the lesbians are booing  I'm trying to keep 
[03:27:30]  this show together  and I said  you know  Steve Perry  is to rock and roll  with Jim Neighbors  is to opera  now  I was mad  I was trying to think  of a joke  you know  Jim Neighbors  being the Gomer Pyle  if somebody doesn't know  and Journey didn't like that  not only did they not like it  their douchebag fans  didn't like it  so now the boos  are getting worse  and worse and worse  so I go backstage  I do more coke  I have another vodka  and I got  I got Fee Wabel  from the tubes  you gonna take that shit  I got any money  you gonna take that shit  from that asshole  yeah  so it's getting worse 
[03:28:00]  oh yeah  they're winding you up  who knows what the next joke was  but I went out there  and I'm doing a few more jokes  not necessarily about Journey  but the crowd's getting more riled  I'm more riled  and I'm trying to  I bring on Bill Graham  they boo him  I bring on Joe Montana  who just won the Super Bowl  for the Niners  I think against Miami  they're booing him  when you're booing Joe Montana  and you're booing  I've got this crowd  it's great  so halftime at the break  Journey's fat fuck manager  Herbie Herbert  I thought he was gonna eat me actually  he gets in my face  Bill Graham has to break us up  because he doesn't want me  hosting the show  I'm making fun of Journey 
[03:28:30]  okay  so they have to take me  who gives a shit  yeah who gives a shit  exactly  they take me off the show  they have the band  Dick Bright  who's like the Bay Area's  Paul Shaver  play on everybody  and the show's just a mess  wow  they threw you off  the fucking show  don't stop believing  that song got ruined  for me after a Sopranos episode  right  you know  that's the first of my thing  he said  that song got ruined  after that last episode  what I was expecting  the show to go out  with a bang  and you just go out  with a blank screen  I still haven't gotten 
[03:29:00]  over it to this day  that song's been ruined  since that episode  it was bad before then  what year is this  she was talking about  like it's yesterday  good  I was having a really bad week  and you know what  I feel like  it could be worse  there you go  that could be my daughter  my daughter's a pussy  she feels like a hooker  she fights crime  I could be coming home  to my son every day  hey dad  can somebody wash my dick  my life could be a lot worse  so they kicked you off  the second half of the show  what babies  and after the show 
[03:29:30]  after the show  everybody's lining up  to take pictures  you know  and that's a little red carpet  and Journey is next to me  and I'm taking a picture  with Bill Graham  and Journey's taunting me  and I give him the finger  and  because they're such assholes  two months later  I get a thing in the mail  from Bill Graham  this is why  the night he died  he came to see me  the night before  and he sent me a thing  in the mail  me and my little Jew  in our tuxes  giving a finger  to Journey  and Bill wrote on it  nobody ever said  this shit was going to be easy  that's what makes it 
[03:30:00]  what it is  keep going  and anyway  that's pictures in my office  and it just  that meant a lot to me  that's pretty cool  I thought we'd end on  a touching note  I like that  a touching note  Bobo wants another donut  but no  you've had enough  Bobo  yeah  nice fucking  I'm doing  I'm doing society a favor  they don't need you  with a sugar buzz  on the fucking subway  or the bus  or whatever the fuck  you take  well Bobby Slayton's  playing the brokers  tonight  and the Maguire's tomorrow  yeah thanks guys  great to see you  great to have you  back on the show  I'm going to be back

[03:32:30]  line of the day  line of the day  I can't even feel  my own nose  Opie and Anthony  have left the building  but there's still  more horses  in the town  after ONA live  with Sam Roberts  is next  this 
[03:33:00]  is after  Opie and Anthony  live  here's your host  Sam Roberts  interns are taking  that tub out of here  I mean the actual tub  not Bobo  Bobby Slayton's  still here  Bobo's still here  thanks for  keeping me here  my pleasure Bobby  I uh  you know  cause Opie and Anthony  said can you stay  and again  I don't have a show  till uh  8 o'clock  7.30  8 o'clock  tonight  on lovely Long Island  you know  I told those guys 
[03:33:30]  the last time  I was at  the brokerage  in Long Island  was 15 years ago  that's the last time  I did the Opie and Anthony  show  when I did that  Rat Pack movie  I came into Plark  and so it's nice  to be back  what happened  that last time  15 years ago  why have you not  been back  in 15 years  we don't know  I mean I  just talked to Opie  about it  he said nothing  happened  you know  I don't know  it's not even worth  going into  but I'm here  I'm back  I'm happy to be back  you know it's really weird  when I come to SiriusXM  because I do a lot  of the other shows  sure  not the big nose  yeah I've heard you  on Ron and Fez  not the big nose Jew  you don't do that anymore  not anymore  is that because 
[03:34:00]  you choose not to  or you haven't been  invited back  since you got into  that fight with him  well it wasn't a fight  no it wasn't a fight  I just don't think  he put me on  because I don't know  maybe I was funnier  maybe I just didn't  fit in with the show  maybe I wasn't funny  maybe I sucked  whatever it is  you know  I'm not back there  but every show that I do  you know  you have the comedy channel  it's still so hard for me  when I come on SiriusXM  which I do a couple times a year  it's still so hard  to say fuck  or shit  because I'm so trained  but you see  I'm so trained  35 years  of doing regular  terrestrial radio  and you know  even when Opie and Anthony 
[03:34:30]  were on regular radio  you still have these guys  who are like  in Omaha  Todd and Tyler  who are great  you have the lunatic man cow  in Chicago  I used to have  John DiBella  Howard's nemesis in Philly  there's a  I'm missing a million guys  but like  we were on with  we were connected  with Brother Weez  earlier today  and like  I was listening  and that's what I was observing  just the fact that  he wanted to say dick  and he wanted to say cock  and he wanted to describe  these things  and he couldn't do it  he had to say like  peeny  and like  Mother Hucker 
[03:35:00]  and you know what I mean  you know what he wants to say  right  well our friend Norton  is on his way to Rochester  now to play for the comedy club  and I know he did a phone-in with Weez  Weez is one of the guys  who when I started out  he would always have me  on a show in Rochester  I mean I know  I started out with him  but I was there two weeks ago  and he had to be on for two mornings in a row  for two hours at a time  and there are things I want to say  and every once in a while  you know a radio station  will have to bleep me  not because we've fallen in a word  but because  oh you came back for the Dunkin' Donuts  or a sponsor  you can't talk  we learned that  when we were back  a few years ago  when we were on a KROQ 
[03:35:30]  when we were doing KROQ  and XM  we were learning  all the rules are new now  it's not like  it was  you know  ten years ago  or whatever  you have to  not only  is it the seven dirty words  but it's also  you can't offend any ethnicities  you can't offend any sponsors  none of it  well it depends who it is  and who you  like in the Tampa  when I do Cowhead Show  or when I go to  Paul and Young Ron  in Miami  everybody has  different rules  you know if you go on the morning shows  the rock and roll morning shows  they like to get away with more stuff  but then I have to go  to the 
[03:36:00]  sunny in the morning  every city of  it's sunny in the morning  so I know  the fact soccer moms  are listening  so I'm not going to sit there  talking about how much I hate my wife  which I do  because nobody's going to buy tickets  who are listening to that show  exactly  and if I do Shade Show  yo yo yo  I gotta yo it up a little bit  right  but not too much  you don't want to humiliate yourself  and be the white guy  who's like  he doesn't talk like that  no no  I don't want to  no I got to  I also don't want to be  stabbed in the neck  when I show up  at the brokerage  no but you know  I want people to come to my show  so again my point is  that when you do 
[03:36:30]  Opie and Anthony  you come on Sirius XM  it's almost hard for me to go  in the other direction  and just be yourself  yeah but you know  because I'm so trained  yeah  you know  then  even though you go on Weez  you can talk about a lot of cool stuff  you know  you can push the envelope  on his show  definitely  you know  but when I go on the TV show  good morning Dallas  hello Omaha  and you're on with the talking head  who just had the Girl Scouts  on with their cookies  and you got five minutes  yeah and you had to make  not even  usually two and a half  yeah  so Bobby  they call you the pit bull of comedy  why is that  well you know  sometimes 
[03:37:00]  and I hear you have a daughter  who's in show  so you know  you want those soccer moms  to come to the show  and uh  it's amazing  Bobo hasn't said anything  he hasn't said a word  Bobo how you doing over there  you feel comfortable  Ed's doing great  I thought it was a great  I thought it was a great appearance  by you  yeah by me  I thought it was great  getting to be  I thought it was like a  I couldn't think of  a greater bunch of people  that I've been on the air with today  now tell me  what uh  what segment on today's show  did you like better  did you like uh  getting uh  sponge bath  from the porn star 
[03:37:30]  Lexi Love  or did you like  just getting a kind of riff  with Bobby Slayton  cause you were right in there  with him  oh he was right in there  he was right in there  wasn't he  well I have to say  getting a sponge bath  from Lexi Love  that is like  that was like a highlight  which part of your body  did you like  when she washed the most  oh I  I thought that felt great  which part though  did you like  the feet or  sponging my dick  oh  I mean it's not that often  you get to  that's like a rarity  to be able to get to say that  that I got  sponged bath  by Lexi Love  I guess it is  especially when you're a virgin  and how old are you 
[03:38:00]  31  31  you know what  let me tell you something  about the pussy thing  do  it's you know  it's great  but once you get it over with  you know  it's it's  it can only get you in trouble  it costs  look  if you're not paying  for a porn star  or a hooker  it still costs you money  you know people go  when you get married  you have a girlfriend  it's free sex  that costs you more  than any  I have paid for sex  yeah but you also  I mean you don't want to  you need the experience  no absolutely  this is part of life  you can't walk around  and be like  well look at all the money  I've saved  I've never used my penis 
[03:38:30]  oh absolutely  you know what  but you know what  it's like when I did  the Tonight Show  before Leno  with Johnny Carson  I did the Tonight Show  with Johnny  and every comic  of my generation  back in the 80s  had done it already  my friend Kevin Pollack  Dana Carvey  started out in San Francisco  they had done it  5-10 times  and my act never  lent itself to television  I finally got on  the Johnny Carson Show  and I said  you know what  if I don't get on again  it's okay  because I know I did it  was it tougher  to do dirty stuff  back then  um  I don't say dirty  I call it honest  brutally honest  right  politically incorrect 
[03:39:00]  you know what it was  when I started out  in San Francisco  I was 22 years old  so that was 35 years ago  and back then  Bobo  I mean I'm trying  to talk to Bobby  I don't know  where this comes from  this is your idea  wait  this is your idea  to keep in mind  not mine  right  that's true  Bobby you might not  have enough to say  we've got to keep  Bobo here  in case you slow down  and take a breath  well now  I've also welcomed  Nicole from  the morning mashup  do you know Nicole  I've never met Nicole  this is Bobby Slayton  hello Nicole  do you know Bobo  I do know Bobo  see everybody knows Bobo  you've got to come in  introduce yourself 
[03:39:30]  to Bobby Slayton  oh Bobo though  he's a regular  if I walk out  which I'm not going to today  at 35 years in showbiz  20 movies and TV shows  under my belt  we'll get recognized  that's Bobo  from I'm being Anthony  right  hey  you get that a lot Bobo  you get recognized a lot  it's kind of hit and miss  it is a little bit  a few more misses  than hits  yeah  Bobo once came in  and said his neighbors  recognize him  that's how he knows  he's famous  wow  that's huge  so yeah 
[03:40:00]  huge  being recognized  can be good  you know I mean  I look I  have been doing this  for a long time  I'm making a nice living  I'm not a giant star  like my friends  but I see when I'm  with famous people  and I'm not saying  that Alec Baldwin  should hit the photographer  and Jay-Z  should go nuts  and you know  but I can see  where these people  especially living in LA  you come out of any restaurant  I came out of a coffee shop  the other day in LA  right down the street  from my house  and behind the wall  hiding in a car  are three or four paparazzi  they look like snipers  because some  I forgot who the actor was 
[03:40:30]  some young kid  you know  is sitting there  having breakfast  they're taking pictures of you  eating your pancakes  picking your nose  talking to a girl  oh he's dating this guy  he's gay  he's with that person  you know  I can see where  they're stalkers  is that tough to deal with Bobo?  I can only imagine  that's tough to deal with  you don't have a lot of  I guess there's not that many  not that many photographers  in Maspice  then again happy stars  pay the paparazzi  to follow them around  look at industry Bobo  look at all business  I'm not going to do that again  I used to do that  did you? 
[03:41:00]  no  I mean you live in LA  you don't know  you move out there  and you become Hollywood  you know  there was one time  my wife and I  don't go out to eat that much  when I'm home in LA  I like to stay home  but it was our anniversary  last year  and I think we went to  Spago  or some big Hollywood restaurant  and Steve Martin  who I don't know  I've met him a few times  he's known to be  a very shy quiet guy  really  and I'm in the bathroom  taking a leak  and Steve Martin's  taking a leak  and some guy was in there  washing his hands  and said to Steve  you think I can get an autograph  while he's pissing?  yeah  and I don't know  if he's going to win  I mean  that  of course he didn't sign it 
[03:41:30]  you know  he could have  the guy had some piss  on his leg  like here you go  if he had a thing of snow  he could have peed his name  exactly  you know  I'm thinking to myself  if that goes on  I mean  I'm not going to sit  and drop a name  years ago  in an Italian restaurant  and somebody just came over  and sat at the table  who was the big star  I've got to know now  you can tell me  I think it was Robin Williams  let's do it  let's drop the names  I think he just got working  Mindy  years ago  and somebody just came out  and sat at the table  I'm just saying  it's happened to me  and I'm nobody  I'm sure it happened  to Opie and Anthony  and to Bobo  Bobo  that goes without saying 
[03:42:00]  you're right  Bobo  are you sleeping Bobo?  no  I was just reading some text  you're on a show right now  let's focus factor here  I was reading some text  from my uncle  that's way more important  my uncle's listening in a car  so then talk to him  on the radio  don't text him  he doesn't want to talk  on the radio  he's on a job  you two are worse  than I mean Anthony  you're encouraging this  the guy's on a job  me and Nicole  or me and Bobo  the guy's deserving  and protecting  whatever area that is  Orange County 
[03:42:30]  which is Orlando  well Nicole  what's going on in your life  yes  enough about me and Bobo  because there are rumors  floating around  that a big announcement  Nicole hosts the morning mashup  and that's on Hits 1  every morning  she knows he listens  every morning  hello  I know  it's true  his daughter is a singer  oh she is  I don't know why  the mashup doesn't  wait wait  what kind of stuff  do you play  top 40  yeah top 40  oh so you're going to  know this band  what is it  they're about to break  big big big time  that's right  you know  they're called  well they were  the pussycat dolls 
[03:43:00]  and now they're called  girl  GRL  yes  we're on vacation  I can't sing along with you  but I do know who they is  I was about to say  do they sound like that  or  because I'm not sure  not quite as good  my daughter not only got  my good looks  but my voice  right  did you know the song  have you heard it  no I mean I might have  it's just I'm not being able  to pick it up  from what you're singing  of course not  no it doesn't sound  anything like that  that could have been  brown sugar  that could have been  any song  so what  did I miss this morning  on the morning mashup  um  I  have a baby in my belly 
[03:43:30]  what  I know  I know  congrats  thank you Bobo  you know how that got there  right Bobo  ah she got late  yes she did  wow  we're making progress here  no this is huge  because Nicole has come  on the after show  you're pregnant  I am pregnant  with a person  with a little girl  wow with a girl  how many months  five months  oh my god  I thought you were  just gaining weight  you know I said that  to a woman  you know look  they call me the pitbull  of comedy  and I'll make fun  of people in the front  but if it looks like  they have a major handicap 
[03:44:00]  I won't  there was a woman  in the front row  one time  and she so looked pregnant  not fat  yeah you gotta be careful  how many was pregnant  are you  she goes I'm not  you know what  I felt horrible  yeah  you know I mean  it's just off  but it's kind of funny  at the beginning  it's funny though  it was like a beer belly  at the beginning  before it was pregnant  let me see the belly  you can't really see it now  were you wearing something  under that shirt  yeah I mean there's a belly  I see it  you see it  there's a little person there  don't pretend that you haven't seen it  see it's amazing  I knew about this for a while  it's amazing  because Nicole has come on this show 
[03:44:30]  and usually the stories that she tells  are just debaucherous  inappropriate  she's come on and talked about  the three ways she had on the beach  while some strange Mexican was watching  she's had a lot of hard partying days  this Nicole from the morning band show  they're over now  but at least for a little while  yeah for the next like what  four months  are you married?  yes I'm married  this is your first kid  this is my first kid  whose kid is  is it your husband's baby?  do you know that's what Matt said  I'm like at the doctor yesterday  and she's like  as long as the baby's happy and healthy 
[03:45:00]  right  he's like yeah and mine  well it's confirmed  it's confirmed  it's his  there's no chance of like  a little Puerto Rican  or black baby coming out  no I hope not  it's just something you want to  make sure your grounds are covered on  well the fact you have to confirm it  means there was some doubt  why would you have to confirm it?  there was no doubt  no he's just joking  there's no doubt  Eric who's on the hotline?  go on  no you got somebody on the hotline?  I don't know  Eric not looking at the phones  go on  Eric  come in Eric  I want to know who it is  if it's the wrong number  I don't want to interrupt  Nicole and Bobby Slate  I wouldn't mind interrupting Bobo  do you want to answer the hotline? 
[03:45:30]  oh  there we go  Anthony  hi  hey  I'm listening  and I heard of course  Nicole's big news  that she could have said  when she was on our show  you didn't ask me  well you came in  and just said I had an announcement  I'm sorry  you know what  I would have maybe said something  but Bobo's penis scared me away  yeah I mean to be fair Anthony  Bobo was sitting there  with his towel open  like a subway flasher  nude  yeah  it wasn't really the vibe for  oh man  I still don't think she would have 
[03:46:00]  she fucking  will save it for your show anyway  I think she did  now I know  you know how much I love you Anthony  there's so much love  five months huh  five months pregnant  and now  you know  oh god  you're gonna fuck that body up  listen  are you worried about that?  it's 100% worried  the vagina?  yeah I'm really worried about it  no I'm not worried about my vagina  that'll be fine  you think so?  I can worry  I'm just worried about  stretch marks  and fucking the ass  causing your skin to hang  you know  and then you get these women  like Jessica Simpson 
[03:46:30]  and these  Kardashian  whatever  you know  I could lose my baby weight  a lot of times  they're just getting fat  and they're eating too much  and they blame the baby weight  because she can  you worried about  what they call lasagna belly  when the skin stretches out  you know what I'm talking about  I mean  now Anthony never wants  to fuck me again  thanks  I don't know  I could just  I could fantasize  about the  the old days  the old days  tight ass  and tight belly  and you know  I'm not gonna be gross  and like gain 70 pounds  you know what happens 
[03:47:00]  oh  and would you fuck her  would you fuck her  while she's pregnant  would you fuck her  while she's pregnant  up until like right now  she looks good  like I didn't notice  she was even pregnant  what the fuck  I know I'm a good hider  yeah she's been wearing  she's  you wanna know  what the truth is  she's been wearing  loose clothing  because the morning mashup  didn't quite know  how to deal with this  announcement  it was a little bit of a problem  what is it like  it's the morning mashup  like the old  I love Lucy  they couldn't even  say the word pregnant  exactly  they don't wanna show it 
[03:47:30]  and you just wear  old frumpy maternity clothes  kind of  and I was afraid  that if before we announced  that I'd walk by the studio  one day  and you guys would just  see my belly  and it would be all over  well you remember  it wasn't that long ago  that she came in here  and you and Jim  were joking  that she was pregnant  she was pregnant  when you said that  wow motherfucker  I knew it  I guarantee they're gonna  have to have a new procedure  cause it's gonna get  stuck like  the feet  could happen  just grapple hook  the underside  she got those 
[03:48:00]  big monster feet  I know  they're only gonna get  bigger too  so I don't wanna talk  about it  oh man  are you having sex  still like  during the pregnancy  yeah  I mean I'm a trooper  I'm actually pretty horny  you are?  yeah  yeah I heard that happen  yeah  oh boy  are your nipples changing?  yeah  oh god  already with the body right?  I'm sorry I told you  to take the call  I'm sorry  I made the suggestion  no no  it was a good suggestion  and it's right  to bring some truth  into this  well I got a good suggestion  to name the kid 
[03:48:30]  you can name the kid Soda  excuse me  what  you can name the kid Soda  why  why would you name him Soda?  I don't know  cause celebrities have  kids with unique names  Bobo did you get fed  that line just now?  no no  that was on my own  very good Bobo  very good  well congratulations Nicole  thank you  I'll get my body  back in tip top shape  as fast as I can  for you  I wanna see right after  you have a kid  like what your body  body looks like  alright I'll send you  I'll send you a nudie  alright thanks  for telling us 
[03:49:00]  on our show  Bob stop  it's all your show  it's your universe  oh okay  alright I'm not  making it about me  you know when my wife  was pregnant  she did the same thing  you know women  always wanna look sexy  and I remember  she was 7-8 months  pregnant and she had  the belly  and I come home  one night  and she tried her best  I'm in bed  I shut the TV off  and she's got a  candle burning  and I'm thinking  great  was she into  Santeria  something  so she walks  in the room  in a sexy lingerie  but as I see 
[03:49:30]  the big belly  and her shadows  on the wall  it looked like  Alfred Hitchcock  when he walked  into a shadow  remember  he did  and he actually  walked into the shadow  it wasn't that romantic  but from behind  you can't tell  so sometimes  we'll just do that  so you do it  from behind usually  sometimes we'll do that  because then you  just can't tell  has there been  any change  sexually  are you having  sex more  no  the same  your husband  likes it  he's a fan  he's a fan  yeah  has pregnant women  has that been a fantasy  of his  no he's  on his bucket list  was to come 
[03:50:00]  on a pregnant belly  is that right  did he get to  he did get to do that  what a treat  I know  was it yours  oh ok  alright  and I thought  Dave Herman  was a pervert  like the six year old  girls  this guy's  going even younger  he's beat Dave Herman  negative six months  well that's a  that's a joyous occasion  have you thought  about lifestyle changes  well I mean  I'm  I have  it's really hard  just not partying  lifestyle change  your whole life's  going to be over  I know  I know  but right now 
[03:50:30]  it's really hard  for me just to like  be a good girl  and not party  yeah you've been  you've been no booze  or anything  not yet  maybe a little sip  here and there  yeah no  wow  you can drink a little wine  Dr. Bobby's in the house  no sushi  can't have sushi  I know  yeah but you know what  whether Nicole's pregnant or not  she can't drink  a little wine  she's got one of those  things going on  yeah  oh god  you know when women drink  it's like feeding gizmo  after midnight  you're psycho enough  the way you are  you're insane  I'm not going to discuss this  with you Nicole  but two glasses of wine  it's like putting 
[03:51:00]  you know  a gremlin in water  you don't want to do it  you got me  let me ask you this  yeah  I talked to Snooki  and JWoww  are going to be on my show  on Sunday  nice  4pm eastern  on this channel  I know  everybody get excited  at once  Snooki told me  that her titties  got tore up  because of the breastfeeding  and that she's going to get  breast implants  after Dancing with the Stars  are you going to breastfeed  because those things  must be getting huge  I mean you just have  no idea  they're like the size  of my head 
[03:51:30]  Bobo  sit  sit  Bobo  let me ask you  that's a great  I'm glad you brought that up  Bobby  relax  he looks so nervous  are you erect  no  stand up  let me see  let me take a look  you don't trust him  let me see  Bobby can you look at the  no  he doesn't want to  Bobby doesn't want to look  alright Nicole then  you do it for me  just see if there's a little  is there any kind of tenting  I feel like you're hiding it  Bobo  he can't  I mean it's just a little  like a little pinprick  poking out  but I wasn't here for the bath  I heard it was really small  to begin with  oh it's so small  so how are you going to tell  well he's three inches  fully erect 
[03:52:00]  is that right Bobo  yeah  two and a half to three inches  yeah  is your husband bigger than that  Nicole  yeah just a little bit  okay  okay  but you can tell though  because he  I guess he wears loose boxers  and when he gets erections  it's just a little  a little pinpoint  is popping through  the crotch of his pants  because it sticks just  straight out  well in a way  that's not bad  because if you have a girlfriend  and you want anal sex  you should be more subjected  to doing it  when you know  it's only going to be  a little teeny pinprick  yeah exactly  good point  I like to look at the positive things 
[03:52:30]  totally  Bobo from now on  you can say  let me just put the tip in  because that's all it is  it's just tip  that's all they'll get  all you have is tip  after what you said  about your husband  I guess there is hope  what did she say  about her husband  she said it's not that much  bigger than mine  I was being facetious  it's actually much  much bigger than yours  ouch  that's got to sting Bobo  that was sarcasm  yeah  I'm sorry  hardest feelings  oh I was going to  phones are weird huh  yeah  okay  has anybody called 
[03:53:00]  nobody called  during 018 to complain about me  did they  anybody picture  no  good  because I was worried  you know your audience  yeah  they're so  they're brutal  and they're brutal  yeah  in a good way  I mean  because I remember  when that famous  it's on YouTube now  you know Bill Burr  and Dom  and you know  Jimmy Schumer  trying to do their show  in Philadelphia  and the crowd  your crowds  are just  they're great  they're loyal  right  but they're nuts  they can be hard to fight  they are  yeah I had to learn a lesson  with Sam  told me a lesson about it  well now you're bringing  a child into it  yeah  well I mean 
[03:53:30]  you're just a dick  if you go after the kid  go after me all day long  go after Matt all day long  go after any part of my body  that you think is weird  but just not the baby  is there any part of your body  are you worried that the baby  is going to have massive feet  no I'm worried about  all different things  because I feel like  some like really beautiful couples  have ugly kids  and some like really hideous couples  have beautiful kids  like you never know  what's going to happen  you know that's why my daughter Natasha  who I'm  I don't like to say blessed  but you know  she is beautiful  and everybody says to me  well first of all  I always get  you sure she's yours  your wife must be beautiful  I mean like 
[03:54:00]  I don't hear this a lot  right  being one of the pussycat dolls  or girl  whatever their name is now  you know she's a beautiful girl  and even when she was 16 or 17  I looked like a dirty old man  walking down the street with her  because you know  they like to dress like Madonna  or whatever  but people say to me  God how do you feel  I have such a beautiful daughter  and I'm going  well you know  great  I have people  oh your daughter's so hot  how do you feel about me saying that  well it's better than people going  oh that's your daughter  is she in a special school  oh  is she  can I set her with Bobo  she's got a lot of problems  you know  but you never  are you going to breastfeed 
[03:54:30]  yeah  you are  I mean I'm going to try  and then when I can't deal with it anymore  are you worried  are you worried  you'll just end up  with these two  kind of long skin flaps  like tube stalks  I'll have to fix it  I mean that's what I can do  you act like I'm like an alien  every woman does this  every woman does  eventually  but you have to know  how your unique body  will change  due to pregnancy  like you have large  they're huge  mammaries  I think is what you prefer them  to be called  they're enormous  and so that is obviously  going to be affected by this child  yeah  you know what I mean  the morning mashup  named you Nicole Biggins 
[03:55:00]  I know  for the tits  I know  that the whole thing was like  hey look  we have a girl on this show  and she's got massive titties  listen to our morning show  that is something  maybe that's why  they didn't want you  to announce you were pregnant  maybe that was the reason  speak to me the truth  about this  you know I never got  the big tit thing  you never did  no you know what  my wife's got nice breasts  but guys  look at her  look at the size of her breasts  yeah but look at her  knuckles are dragging on the ground  she's got a mustache  she's got great tits  guys are so obsessed with that  they're blinded by them  it has to be part of 
[03:55:30]  a better package  right  yeah  it can't just be  that's what she has  my wife's got nice breasts  they're perfectly  perfect  they're not giant  they're not small  that's romantic  you know  they're fine  yeah  by the way  she tried to breastfeed  it wasn't really  working out that great  so she just got  the bottle stuff  there you go  was this baby a surprise  this baby  yeah  no  or were you trying  a little bit  you were making an effort  giving it the old college try  we gave it the old college try  here's what I want you to know  and I need you to be truthful  with me on this  did anybody  and you don't have to mention  any names  associated with  Sirius XM Hits 1 
[03:56:00]  or the morning mashup  suggest that you take care of it  if you know what I'm saying  no  I'm just asking  that's something  because they were a little  I can't promise you  that they didn't think it  okay  was there sort of  a boardy vibe  going on  there might have been  like an undertone  of it from a few people  and that was hard  to deal with  it must have been  I think it's just  this industry  is so fucked up  I don't know  I don't know  it might just be  some of the people  you're around  no one said  there was no  boardy vibe  you just said  a boardy vibe  a boardy vibe  let me ask you another question 
[03:56:30]  if I may  Bobby Slate  of course playing  Governor's tonight  the brokerage  tomorrow  McGuire's  okay now  Long Island  watch out  with that out of the way  did your husband  want a boy or a girl  he wanted a boy  desperately  every time I went to the doctor  he said  do you stock  do you see a penis  and I was like  there's no way  you're getting a boy  because  I mean the doctors  still don't see a penis  when they look at Bobo  womanizing douchebags  don't get boys  they get girls  as payback  so he got a girl  you know what  here's two things  I heard  first of all  when my wife was pregnant 
[03:57:00]  25 years ago  I said  I want a boy  I want a boy  but you know what  I'm not that into sports anymore  I know that sounds gay  that's gay  they're bringing  all with any cupcakes  but  I don't really care about sports  and I don't really play sports  you know  so I said  and the more I thought about it  I thought a girl would be really cool  because there's been no girls in my life  you know  I have two brothers  you know  my uncle has  two or three sons  my other uncle has  a couple of sons  nobody has  there's no girls in my family  and I  have always had horrible girlfriends  and horrible relationships  with women  I thought this would be my chance  to be a good dad  to retain yourself 
[03:57:30]  really cool stuff  it didn't work out  no it didn't  have you named the baby?  no  you know what  which is great for you  Sam is  either way  it works  we got some callers  cool  917  you there?  that's their name  oh here you go  I don't know what their name  oh ok  cool  917  yeah  what's up  what's up buddy  I just wanted to say  oh my god  how boring is Bobby Slayton  oh jesus  do I hang up on it Bobby? 
[03:58:00]  that Bobo is stealing his thunder  come on  come on  I don't know if Bobo is stealing his thunder  I think they were both shining  yeah  personally  I know they put the douchebags through  yeah  the 917 douchebags  but you know what  it doesn't matter how funny  or entertaining I try to be  they do what Ron and Fez does  they try to put the douchebags through  they do  they do  Luke in Massachusetts  hey what's up  I think I might have missed it earlier  Nicole what are you having  a Yeti?  did you say a Yeti?  oh my god look  we got a comedian on the line 
[03:58:30]  I believe girl  is what she said  yes I'm having a girl  she's having a girl  but that was cute  right  you know Yeti is  Bigfoot is a Yeti  yes I'm aware of what a Yeti is  okay that's what he was getting at  Nicole's got huge feet  I don't know if you noticed that Bobby  when she walked in  I didn't see them  because they're under the console  but gathering  you know  from  yeah they're not attractive  they're not  God did not bless me with feet  what size are they?  they're like  nine and a half  I was thinking double digits  women's sizes are different  if they were guy's size  15  oh stop it  no they would not be  oh  wow  it's terrible  yeah and I have bunions 
[03:59:00]  they're ugly  go ahead Bobo  I think the best way to describe  Nicole's feet  yeah  remember Margaret Children  Harold Bundy  used to complain about the shoe store  yes I do  about to try  keeping it topical  that's what Bobo does  that's pretty much the best way  to describe  the way Nicole's describing her feet  it's too bad  I love my wife's feet  I have that little foot fetish thing  a lot of guys do  and I thought I was weird  when I was a teenager  until I started watching so much porn  and they just see it in porn a lot  do you really have a foot fetish?  not a foot fetish  but I always find my wife's feet cut out  like do you lick them 
[03:59:30]  and like suck on them?  yeah  wow  do you get your feet licked  or does your husband stay away from them?  I mean he'll rub them  but he will not like them  I've heard Russell Peters  may have a foot fetish  do you know  let me tell you about Russell Peters  Russell Peters  he just happens to be  one of the biggest stand-up comedians  in the world  and  he's got a brand new comedy special  it's called Notorious  premiering exclusively on Netflix  the hour long special  was shot on Russell's  recent world tour  and is the newest comedy special  from Netflix  if you haven't already  checked it out  you really have to  Notorious
