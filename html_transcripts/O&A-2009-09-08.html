<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, interspersed with listener calls, voicemails, and audio clips.  The show began with Jimmy Norton's return, discussing his experience on Jay Leno's new 10 PM show, including the high-profile guests and the network's apparent attempt to reconcile with Leno after the Conan O'Brien debacle.  This led to a discussion of the positive reception of Leno's show compared to Conan's, and a mention of a *Time* magazine article referencing the Opie and Anthony Show.

Listener calls and voicemails followed, including a voicemail from Norton's mother expressing concern about him due to California wildfires.  The hosts then engaged in a lengthy discussion about baseball, focusing on the Yankees' winning streak, Derek Jeter's record, mocking John Sterling's home run calls, criticizing the Mets and their new stadium, and even discussing the unusual batting helmets of John Olerud and a Buffalo Bills player.  A listener suggested “SodaHead13,” a trivia contestant from a YouTube video.  The upcoming "Fur Fright" event, a furry convention with sexual undertones, was extensively discussed, along with listener calls recounting awkward encounters with the show's staff, including one describing Kenny hovering over him and his girlfriend.  Clips from the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon were played, highlighting Lewis's frustration with a sponsor and his use of the phrase "illiterate faggot."

The show continued with a segment heavily focused on Sam's impending attendance at "Fur Fright 09," with the hosts teasing him mercilessly about his costume, eventually settling on a used rabbit costume from the office.  A caller, Joey, provided further details about the convention's activities, hinting at sexual encounters.  This was followed by the playing of a video clip of Buffalo Bills cornerback Ellis Langsdale's incoherent press conference, prompting speculation about his mental state.  Opie's upcoming reluctant fly-fishing trip with Bob Kelly was discussed, along with a humorous YouTube video of a young Howard Stern fly-fishing.  The segment briefly touched upon a news story about a firefighter beaten into a coma on the Staten Island Ferry.  Other fleeting topics included David Tyree’s release from the Giants, Mark McGwire's home run record, Carol Miller’s radio show, Ronnie James Dio, and a caller's video contest entry.

A subsequent segment began with a suggestive exchange about herpes before transitioning to a movie discussion.  Jimmy Norton recounted a negative experience revisiting *The Idol Maker*, followed by a debate about *Scarface*.  News about the Naked Cowboy dropping out of the mayoral race was met with puns.  Further movie discussions included *88 Minutes*, *Quarantine*, *1408*, *Inglourious Basterds* (criticized by a caller for its pacing), and *The Prestige*.  The hosts then discussed Nikola Tesla versus Thomas Edison and *Harold and Maude*.  A lengthy voicemail from Sylvester Stallone pitching a "monster movie" *Rambo 5* concept was played and deemed underwhelming.  Technical difficulties prevented the playing of an audio clip related to the Van Jones controversy.  The segment concluded with a mention of intern Graham's submitted song, "Punch Him in the Dick," by Juicy Carcass and a discussion of John Fogerty's wig.  A phone call with Kevin Smith, who was engaged in a 24-hour tweet-a-thon, discussed the tweet-a-thon, his upcoming book and tour, and clarified a nonexistent feud with Bruce Willis.

Another segment detailed Kenny's disastrous solo flight, leading to a discussion on airline baggage fees and Jimmy promoting his 5.11 Tactical carry-on bag.  This segued into another playing of  "Punch Him in the Dick," followed by an extensive discussion of Van Jones's dismissal,  featuring highly offensive and inflammatory language regarding Jones, Obama, and broader political issues.  The segment concluded with a critique of modern comic strips.

The final segment featured listener calls predominantly about taxes and government programs, with vulgar and sarcastic commentary from the hosts and Jimmy. Callers shared anecdotes about tax refunds and government assistance programs, sparking discussions about perceived inequities.  The conversation shifted to cigarette regulations and the tobacco industry.  A caller, John from Denver, and another similarly incoherent caller were ridiculed for their difficulty articulating coherent sentences.  Several female callers expressed crushes on Anthony, leading to crude exchanges.  Jimmy discussed upcoming plans, including an Aussie tribute event, and anecdotes about meeting Dwight Yoakam. The segment concluded with more listener calls, banter about a Super Troopers-esque bit, speculation about a previous intern, and the signature phrase about "Mongo, the bacon-hoarding goon."  The entire segment was rife with profanity and sexually suggestive comments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  All right, look at us all back.  It's Tuesday already.  Yeah.  That's nice.  And Jimmy's back.  Jimmy's back for like...  Dino's back!  Dino's back!  Jimmy's back for like two days and then he's gone another week.  I don't even know his schedule anymore.  I'm back.  He's becoming a big Hollywood star in front of our eyes. 
[00:00:30]  No, I just got two...  I was supposed to be gone for a couple days and then back most of next week and then gone for just next Friday.  But instead of doing the Friday show for Leno, I'm doing the Tuesday show.  So I'm just...  It's the same amount of days but in different order.  A little show called Leno.  A little show called the Jay Leno Program.  Yes.  Man, they are promoting the hell out of the new Leno show.  They said it's known...  It's got twice as much recognition as any other show that's going to come on before it's come on.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  They get rid of Leno for Conan O'Brien and then Leno moves to 10 o'clock and I'm telling you, 10 o'clock is going to become the new slot. 
[00:01:00]  I'm telling you, it's going to happen.  And the reason it's going to happen is because they're not doing the CSIs and all those drama shows anymore because they're too expensive to make.  Yeah.  So all the networks are going to go and try to find something like a Leno-type show.  And he's the best in the genre.  His show, five of his show, the whole week will cost less than one drama.  One drama.  You're not paying residuals for actors.  There's so many things you're saying.  And that's why this time around the 10 o'clock time slot's going to work. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Because over the years, the 10 o'clock time slot's been a little weird.  But the world is changing in the TV world.  I'm telling you, I know I'm very biased because I'm involved with it, but I've seen, I watched some of the test shows and this were in front of full audiences.  Jay and a tie doing the monologue, real guests, everything.  It's fucking funny, man.  Is it different?  It is because there's more comedy sketches and stuff, but it's still Leno.  It's like, you feel like I'm watching something different, but you don't feel like uncomfortable with it.  It's not like watching, you know, like Johnny Carson run around in a skirt. 
[00:02:00]  Like, what am I doing?  You feel like this is kind of what he should be doing.  It feels comfortable to see.  Oh, that's awesome.  And this set is like, you know, it's like a $50 million set.  It's just, you know, it looks great.  I mean, it's like, of course, I wouldn't say it if it was not good.  Yeah.  But it's nice to be able to honestly say it's great.  He's going to be their top dog.  Even though they pushed him out for Conan, he's going to be their top dog again.  Yeah.  They should have never pushed him out is what it comes down to.  But I think in the end, this is going to really work out for him. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  I think it's going to be even better than what was happening.  That's up there with the Red Sox booting Babe Ruth as far as a dumb move.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Fucking guy was a monster at the ratings.  And they're smart to keep him, though.  I was talking the other day about how I'm a fan of Conan O'Brien.  I think he's funny.  Yeah.  I watched his show, and it was on late at night.  But I caught the first episode of his show in Leno's time slot. 
[00:03:00]  And since then, I've not even watched it.  Like, I have no idea about what's going on, who's on.  There's no real buzz.  You know?  I don't care.  Well, it's hard to replace Jay with anybody because it's like people already know Conan.  He's got a big fan base.  Yeah.  But people have made a decision on him, just like they already made a decision on Letterman  because they've known these guys for years.  Yeah.  So, like, when a new guy like Craig Ferguson comes along, then people kind of watch and  say, well, let's see if we like him.  People already know if they like or don't like Conan.  Yeah.  I like Craig Ferguson. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Do you watch him at all?  I watch moments of him, but I hear he's pretty cool with comedians, so.  Yeah, he's all right.  So, you're going to be on the second show next Tuesday, a week from today?  Yeah, it's Michael Moore and myself and.  Oh, a bunch of liberals getting together.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Jimmy hanging out with his liberal friends.  This weird satellite.  He's got this guy on satellite from Boston, Tom something.  He's doing some, Tommy Cruz.  He's doing this thing from.  Oh, oh, oh, really? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, just this.  I think that's who his name is.  And.  Tom Cruise.  Oh, Tom.  That's it.  Oh, Tom.  That's it.  Oh, wow.  That's it.  Yes, I forgot his name.  So what?  It's going to be you, Michael Moore and Tom Cruise?  Yeah, but Tom will not be in the studio.  Jay's doing something called 10 at 10, which is where he's interviewing people on a satellite,  just firing 10 questions at them.  It's how he's getting another guest.  And yeah, it'll be myself and then Mikey.  And his first show, he's got Seinfeld, and then the second show is Tom Cruise.  First show, he's got Seinfeld, and they're doing this thing where they have different 
[00:04:30]  people singing together, and he's got Rihanna, Kanye West, and Jay-Z as the musical  action.  Oh, boy.  They don't have a following.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he's got fucking mammoth guests.  Kevlar.  Yeah.  I know.  And Seinfeld, too.  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be funny if Seinfeld started shit with those three?  Like a big beef film?  God damn, Jimmy.  That's awesome for you, man.  I'm very psyched, man.  Awesome.  I'm very psyched.  I mean, it seems like they're trying to apologize to Jay Leno with what they're doing with the 
[00:05:00]  big over-the-top set, the A-listers.  Yeah, they got the advertisers.  You can't watch NBC without that damn logo on the left-hand corner saying Jay Leno next  Monday or whatever.  Yeah, and for the show, yep.  He's on the cover of Time this week, and they were saying that it was a bad move to pull  on him.  For his hate speech?  Yes.  We got a little mention in the Time magazine article, Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah.  Jim Norton from the O.P.  Anthony show.  The shock.  Jay told me that.  He goes, hey, you got a mention in time.  They said that O.P.  Anthony was shock.  You know, he kind of laughed at them. 
[00:05:30]  Shock.  I thought they looked great, though, man.  They're still calling us shock jocks?  But it didn't come off as shitty.  They were saying, like, because they were saying, is the show going to be lame?  And then they're like, well, maybe it won't be lame.  And then they say they got comedian Jim Norton from the shock O.P.  It was kind of a cool place to be mentioned, man.  Yeah.  I was very happy.  Boo!  Ah!  I was shocking, people.  I was very frightened.  Don't do that.  That's how you're shocked.  Did you see the fires?  Oh, we played your voicemails?  Oh, yeah.  The one with your mom is so good.  Oh, is that so good? 
[00:06:00]  Like you're running toward the fire because you don't know any better.  Jimmy, they're dropping him in.  Wait, do we have that so we can reference it?  Oh, I love that one.  Let's talk about it.  Let E-Rock get it real fast before you explain it first.  I'll call you back, Mom.  I'm wearing a gas hat.  Well, E-Rock could get it or you could get it fast.  Which one do you want?  Good point.  We actually, no, Jonathan tried to show us where the fires were because we couldn't see them.  You could see that cloud because we were out there at the same time as you.  That smoke cloud was amazing.  I didn't even notice it. 
[00:06:30]  You really didn't?  Honest to God, no.  We tried to go on buildings and see it.  There's some great outdoor roof places.  I thought it was Snoop Dog's house.  Cloud?  I didn't even get that and I still like it.  He smokes a lot of pot.  He might have been having a pot party.  I'm so tired.  I thought it was like a Snoopy reference.  Oh, no.  I'm sure everybody probably thought it was a rink.  Track three?  No, it's not working.  I'm only kidding, Eric.  I'm kidding. 
[00:07:00]  I missed.  You haven't seen him in three weeks.  I miss, Eric.  You haven't seen him in three weeks.  That's the first thing you say.  The first torpedo's been fired.  Jesus, how long has Dimitri Martin been a fucking intern here?  Who's that little creep?  I know there's a couple of new creeps walking around here.  It's great.  1970s detective sideburns.  Kid bugs me.  I'm like manic.  So, Jimmy's out in L.A. getting ready for the Leno thing and his mom called because of  the L.A. fires.  He's just a worried mom.  We did play this while Jimmy was gone, but just so we could talk about it more, we want 
[00:07:30]  to play it again here.  Hey, it's me.  I'm still in L.A.  I'm still in L.A.  And things are going great.  You know, we're just working on segments for Leno's show and it's going well.  But my mother apparently thinks I'm in great danger because of the fires that are raging  in California.  So, this is the message I got from my mother today.  I'm nowhere near the fires. 
[00:08:00]  I couldn't be farther from the fires than I am right now.  I mean, I'm more in danger if somebody's freaking a cigarette out the window and burning  me.  But she's home panicking, thinking that her baby boy is going to Tinseltown and being 
[00:08:30]  burned up in the awful fires.  I should call back screaming and ask her to help call the fire department and hang up  on her.  It's just amazing.  It's embarrassing to hear my own voice.  I never listen to those before I send them.  I never listen to them.  I listen to them.  No, they're really good, Jimmy.  Keep sending them.  Thank you.  Your mom's voice is just so, mom, I am just so worried about the fires. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, mom, don't be silly.  Relax.  I think I'm doing it, rolling around in a fucking straw clothing in flames.  In a hotel.  Yeah.  Well, we discussed it.  Like, when your parents get older, they don't have anything else to do.  They watch their favorite show on TV and they go eat.  Yeah.  So when they see, like, L.A. fires and you're in L.A., you know, they instantly start worrying.  And it becomes an excuse to call you.  Yeah.  Moms want an excuse to call you.  Like, it could be anything.  Yeah.  She knows I'm not burning, but she's like, what else can I say to them? 
[00:09:30]  Aha, fire.  That connects us.  I watch the news.  There's fires there.  She just wants to be closer to you, Jimmy.  I wish, you know, I wish I was a better son.  Like, I love my parents.  I really do.  I get a great relationship with them, but I'm just walled off.  They're so proud of you.  I know.  Every time I see them, they're so proud of their son.  I think I just have so many shame issues which have nothing to do with them.  Yeah.  Aww.  So, yeah, you were all right.  You weren't anywhere near the fires.  You didn't even see the smoke.  No.  I saw the smoke when I was out there.  I can't believe you didn't see the smoke. 
[00:10:00]  We may have seen a smoke cloud and not known it was a smoke cloud.  I mean, but I can't remember seeing anything.  Because Jonathan took us to this rooftop at night, so we figured we'd see it.  Nothing.  Nah, couldn't see anything.  Do we have everyone saying, you said the first thing you would do when Jimmy got back  was play the John Sterling call.  Do we have the John Sterling call in front of me?  This is...  I doubt we have it.  That means I-Rock has to run back down the hall.  Oh, I-Rock.  Wow.  Here comes I-Rock again.  Holy shit.  It is good.  I thought I saw my water looking like Jurassic Park. 
[00:10:30]  Why would he say that, I-Rock?  Because you started.  I didn't mean to.  Because you started.  Sorry.  There you go.  You know, I-Rock has a body like the guy who starred in The Life of Riley.  I forget who that was.  He played the original Babe Ruth.  I think the problem we have with I-Rock, he's like a guy that's not supposed to be fat.  Like, if you're a fat guy, you're a fat guy.  I think we have more of a problem with people that aren't supposed to be fat, they're fat.  He's a mutant.  Yeah.  Because he's not even that big. 
[00:11:00]  No.  Steve is twice the size of...  Poor fat feller.  ...of I-Rock.  Well, Jimmy, here you go.  Yeah, the Yankees, blah, blah, blah, fuck off.  Yankees are kicking ass.  They won a doubleheader yesterday.  Over the Rays?  Over the Rays.  And they are now, I believe, nine games ahead of Boston.  You got that right, Anthony.  Nine games ahead of the Swox.  And I didn't know this.  Derek Jeter's only four hits away from Lou Gehrig's record of most hits by a Yankee.  Way from Iron Man.  He had no fucking idea that he was that close. 
[00:11:30]  Way from Iron Man's record.  But he went 0 for 8 yesterday.  I know.  He had no hits yesterday.  Oopsie.  I got to start watching again, man.  I've been away too long for baseball, and it's like, what am I doing?  If you're picking a season to hop back on the Yankees' bandwagon, this one's it.  Because they are kicking ass.  I do want to see Jeter get the record, too.  I love watching him again.  Yeah.  That guy's a great player.  He might be.  He's definitely the best shortstop the Yankees have ever had.  No, you can't say he's the most valuable Yankee ever.  All-around player. 
[00:12:00]  He ranks right the fuck up there.  He's up there, yeah.  He is amazing.  Yeah.  Really is.  He's in the top.  What do you think?  What Yankees better?  Top 20.  I think even.  You got to go pretty far back to like Joe D.  DiMaggio.  The problem is, they've had, I mean, started listing all the players they had.  It's insane.  Ruth Gehrig.  I can't believe you guys are into my team now, the Yankees.  Are you a Yankee fan?  I thought you were.  Yeah.  I've been a lifelong Yankee fan. 
[00:12:30]  Now everyone's jumping on the bandwagon.  Now that they're just kicking ass this shit.  If I thought for a second that was true, we all know your team is the Mets.  This year, they're the misfit toys.  They just, one has an arm broken off, one's missing an eye.  They're crawling around.  This is how much I care about the Mets this year.  I could not name the starting lineup.  Because they're all replacements for people that are injured.  I could not name them.  They're horribly injured.  Very injured.  You should show Jimmy David Wright's fine batting helmet. 
[00:13:00]  He finally got rid of that thing.  Oh, yeah, he was being locked and made fun of.  This is what my team is talking about.  As the Yankees are.  David Wright got clocked in the head.  So he figured he'd.  But instead of talking about how great my team is this year,  this is what everyone's talking about.  Like that giant helmet he's wearing.  What's he doing?  Look at this fucking thing.  It's fantastically big.  Why would you do that?  You look retarded.  You're not a man.  I don't care you got a little scared. 
[00:13:30]  Well, dum-dums.  I don't want to get hit by a ball again, dum-dums.  But you can't walk out on a baseball field with a helmet like that.  What's David Wright doing?  He pitches or he's a?  Oh, boy.  No, he's not a pitcher.  He's a home run hitter.  Oh, he's a hitter.  Okay.  Yeah.  He's a slugger, Jimmy.  He sits there and stands at the plate and doesn't want to get clocked in the head again.  No, but look how giant that helmet is.  Worst helmet ever worn in Major League Baseball, I think.  That is a bad one.  That could be something we could discuss a little bit today. 
[00:14:00]  But anyway, the Yankees, Jimmy.  John Sterling, of course, we've brought it to everyone's attention how awful his home run call is.  And how he just has a name for everybody.  He's got like a little funny little thing for every player on the roster.  And wow.  Before we move on from the Mets, I just saw this in our little one sheet.  I'm sorry, Ant.  Report says Citi Field, the brand new Shea Stadium, I call it the brand new Shea Stadium,  is already falling apart with leaks, mold, and concrete falling off walls. 
[00:14:30]  Mold?  And the new baseball set?  That's a report out today.  Wow.  Is that true?  Come on.  What's that about?  That can't be.  Come on now.  That's not good.  You know, it was an embarrassment.  I guess, was it the...  Who the hell was playing Toronto?  Was it the Sox?  I don't know.  Were playing Toronto?  But they were showing the stadium up there in Toronto. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  It is a falling apart piece of shit.  For real?  Yeah.  The announcers were showing it.  It was like the...  That was the stadium.  The stadium.  First of all, they have players on the outside.  These giant posters of players, three of which they were showing aren't even with the team  anymore.  And then they showed, like it said, the Toronto A's.  Letters are just falling off.  And it was just a wreck.  That stadium apparently is...  Are they having financial problems, that team?  No one goes to the games. 
[00:15:30]  They're like...  The stadium's pretty sparse when they're playing.  Yeah, really bad.  Falling apart.  How great would it be right now if the Yankees just traded Jeter to like the, I don't know,  you name an awful team to the Reds for some draft pick named Chip Jeffries, who's like  a utility infielder.  Just trade him to a team where he would look awful in their uniform. 
[00:16:00]  For no reason.  Right.  And just look completely out of place.  Just before he makes the record, yeah.  Yeah.  Be the worst move in baseball history.  And then just say, live with this one, stupid.  Yeah.  Stupid senile George wants to make one more decision.  And they say, okay, and that's it.  We'll let you make one decision.  So here's John Sterling.  And I'm taking Girardi as a manager.  Oh, really?  Everyone was on his case when they weren't doing that well. 
[00:16:30]  You're right.  But you know something?  The guy's got balls.  He really seems to stand behind the team.  You know?  He's ready to get out there in some of the umps' faces.  When they make shitty calls.  Does he kick dirt good?  No, I haven't seen him kick dirt, but I've seen him with that pissed off look.  He shows a lot more emotion in his face than Torrey did.  Like, Torrey would sit there while the team is melting down and just chew and look and think about his prostate.  And fucking...  Well, he didn't want to yell too much or his prostate would just drop to the... 
[00:17:00]  It would fall out the dugout.  Fall out onto the field.  But Girardi really, you know...  I'm not a fan.  He seems to really be full of piss and vinegar when it comes to the team.  I'm not a fan of the kicking of the dirt.  It looks just ridiculous no matter what manager does it.  Who does that anymore?  They'd throw you right the fuck out now.  Reason Citi Field is falling apart.  We're leading toward the John Sterling phone call.  Yes.  Home run call here.  It's a sports break.  Yeah, Nick in New Mexico.  Nick.  Yeah, good morning, guys.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you, Nick.  There's only so many good contractors in New York. 
[00:17:30]  And you know they've got all the good ones for Yankee Stadium.  Oh.  Click.  I love the sound of the phone as it's going back to the thing.  It sounded like you had an old school phone, too.  That is such a distinct sound of just click, click, click.  I didn't mind the concept.  Yeah.  Because the Yankees get a lot more respect in this town than the Mets.  It's true.  Jimmy James, New Hampshire.  Jimmy James.  Hi. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, JJ.  I think I could hear that last caller sweating.  Dude, it's the sound of a bomb.  It's the crinkle of the phone as it goes back to the receiver.  You think he had a cold sweat going on?  Oh, dude.  He was awful.  I got a nominee for worst helmet.  Okay.  John Olerud.  He always looked like he just finished his ice cream sundae and flipped it over to go  out and bat.  You guys remember John Olerud?  Yeah.  John Olerud had a bad one.  Yeah.  Maybe we can find a quick one of John Olerud.  I forgot about him. 
[00:18:30]  One of my favorite Jay Moore moments is when he told Fanny he looked like John Olerud.  Yeah, John Olerud.  Look at that.  Ah, look at that little thing.  He had a tiny little batting helmet.  That looks stupid.  A little batting helmet.  It's so little.  That's a little.  I'm going to hang up and listen to myself on the radio now.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Enjoy.  That does look really stupid.  Yeah.  All right.  On the field, yeah.  Yeah.  So John Sterling's latest home run call for Jimmy. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  The payoff.  There goes the deep right center.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  He's done it again.  Eric Hinsky.  Ah.  That's it.  Okay.  Eric Hinsky.  And then he goes, ah.  Like, here it comes, folks.  He's got to do the ah beforehand.  Now, Ant and I racked our brains for, I don't know, like five, ten minutes trying to figure  out how he would rework Hinsky.  My douche receptors in my brain could not, didn't have enough power to come up. 
[00:19:30]  We couldn't figure it out.  With what this fucking guy came up with.  Eric Hinsky.  Yeah.  He'll never get it, by the way.  No, no.  It's impossible for someone to think on that line.  Eric Hinsky.  Does it rhyme?  No.  No, it's not a rhyme.  Okay.  It doesn't go with a rhyme.  Okay.  No.  Eric.  I don't know.  Because the ones I thought of was something about Nox and Mincy. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, that's a rhyme.  That's a rhyme.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't think of anything with Eric Hinsky.  It is gone.  He's done it again.  Eric Hinsky.  Oh.  Hinsky with your best shot.  Eric Hinsky drills into the right center via bleachers and ties the ball game at one.  Oh, God. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, boy.  By the way, this wasn't.  Hinsky with your best shot.  And this wasn't the right one, by the way.  No?  Oh, because that was the.  Right, right.  That was the other one.  The first one is where he really worked.  Hinsky with your best shot.  Hinsky with your best shot.  Yeah.  Fire away.  Oh.  You want to see how he does the home run call?  On YouTube, it's called the Sterling Shake.  Well, this is the Yankees win.  Oh, the Yankees win, right.  You know how he, yeah.  Yeah.  Ends every game with the Yankees win thing? 
[00:21:00]  Yes.  If you check out.  It'll be a 3-1.  Swung on and driven down the right field line.  There, the game is over.  It's a fair ball into the corner.  Benamit scores.  Johnny Damon gets his sixth hit of the day.  A rippy single.  Ball game over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  And then he looks around.  And then he looks around for approval.  Fucking asshole.  Why don't you stop it, fatso? 
[00:21:30]  He looks like Zippy the Chimp.  You're embarrassing yourself.  I don't get it.  You can't force those moments like that.  It's just going to happen.  It really is.  It's embarrassing.  Yeah.  Oh.  Hinsky with your best shot.  That would not be a good song.  No.  Hinsky with your best shot.  Why don't you Hinsky with your best shot?  What's that mean?  I don't know.  But there was one that was a back-to-back and a belly-to-belly with him.  Of course there was.  A belly-to-belly. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to Bill in Philly.  Bill.  Bill.  Hello, gentlemen.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you, Bill.  Okay.  You're talking about bad helmets.  Oh, when were you up at Geneseo?  When was I up there?  Fuck.  Way too long ago to admit.  There's a guy on the Buffalo Bills, Mark Kelso.  He had a helmet, and then they took the shell from another helmet and put it on top of his  original helmet. 
[00:22:30]  Why?  I don't know.  I guess he had head problems.  Oh.  I guess he had head problems.  Oh, damn.  That looks silly.  Wow.  It looks like he...  Is that...  Wow.  It looks like a badass.  They hit the helmet with a truck.  No kidding.  Oh, did he have a bad brain or something?  Well, we're looking at a helmet.  We're looking at a helmet that has a big chunk missing, like he got hit by a sledgehammer  or something in front.  Yes.  Wow.  That's funny.  By the way, guys.  Yeah.  I don't know if you ever heard of this guy, but I was watching... 
[00:23:00]  Have you ever heard of the show Tosh.0 on Comedy Central?  What's it called?  Tosh.0.  It's a comedian named Daniel Tosh.  No, I know Daniel, but I don't know.  I've never seen the show.  No.  Okay, here's a show on Comedy Central where they show clips from, you know, different viral  videos and crap.  Mm-hmm.  Not a bad show.  It's coming back in October.  Mm-hmm.  He found or showed a guy that you guys need to find to go up against Bobo and or Rich in 
[00:23:30]  some kind of trivia contest.  Look up SodaHead13.  SodaHead13.  Yeah, he's some retard with one tooth and maybe Hasbro kites, and his whole thing is  he puts on heavy metal, turns on his webcam, looks in the mic, tries to be all tough, starts  yapping, flexing his muscles, and his whole deal is he tries to down an entire Soda. 
[00:24:00]  Sounds thrilling.  We're looking at his picture.  He really, he almost looks like if you took Stinky and stretched his head.  So, why are we looking at this, uh, Bill?  Well, no, what I'm saying is if you can find this guy somehow...  He's not even drinking.  What is he drinking, Coke?  But he's not drinking here.  You don't see any bubbles in.  It's not going down.  He doesn't mean he does Snapple, he does Mountain Dew, he does beer. 
[00:24:30]  What's he do?  He just drinks a whole soda, Jimmy.  That's his whole thing.  He just sits there and guzzles.  God was so mad at his family.  Well, he has a nice profile.  He looks like a snail holding a soda.  He'd be perfect to go up against that.  Yeah, all right.  We'll look into him a little further when we're not doing a live show.  Wow.  Try to find some clips that might make sense for the show.  He looks like...  All righty.  Thank you, Bill.  He looks like a weird circus mirror Pete Townsend in his young days. 
[00:25:00]  That guy's great.  Or like a stretched head Stinky.  I don't know what to make of that, but all right.  He's a fool.  He really is.  Thank you, Bill, for slowing down the fine...  Thank you, Bill.  ...case that we set for ourselves.  Here's the original Henske call, by the way.  That's probably a good kisser.  Don't have trouble with the breaking ball, but here's Henske, and he takes inside.  Now, Ray Deals, swung on, hit in the air to Deke, left center.  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone!  Eric Henske hits one the other way, right over the 364-foot side. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, Henske with your best shot.  Eric Henske drills his sixth, and the Yankees now take a 9-6 lead.  That was a perfectly good call before he ruined it.  Right, I know.  And he has to go, oh, like, here it comes, folks.  Oh, Henske with your best shot!  Dude, are there Yankees...  Maybe I'm nuts, but are there Yankee fans that like that?  Like, who likes that? 
[00:26:00]  That's what we were discussing.  We don't know.  Who likes that?  We don't know.  I haven't met one.  No.  I know.  You've got to think the majority of people listening get kind of douchey when they hear that.  But we don't know.  He's an ass.  We've got to get a poll going or something with Yankee fans.  All right, let's say hi to Mike in Montacoma.  Mike?  Mike, where are you from?  Ron Conkoma.  Oh, all right.  They just spelled it very weird on the screen.  Ron Conkoma.  I know Ron Conkoma.  That's out on Long Island. 
[00:26:30]  Home of Bird's Place.  Oh, yes.  I'm a high school teacher, and I was wondering if Anthony had any special message for the students  going back to school today.  Oh, it's the first day of school.  Yes, it is.  Ah.  Have sex with your teachers, but keep your yaps shut.  I don't think that's possible, but I'll keep it in mind.  Are you a teacher?  I am a teacher.  What do you teach?  I teach social studies.  Oh, I went to college with your brother, Quinn.  Oh, I was just hanging out at his house last night for a little BBQ. 
[00:27:00]  Ah, very nice.  Tell him I said it along.  Cat bowl.  School starts again now?  Today?  Today's the first day there, Jimmy.  It's so nice to not know that, isn't it?  It's no kidding.  Great.  You have no idea.  I remember all the years you used to sweat it out going, ah, fuck.  I'm going back to school.  Not having any kids that have to go to school.  Oh, it's great.  Got to buy new Trapper Keepers.  Say hello to Mrs. Busby.  Condoms.  Mrs. Busby.  The first day of school used to be just the worst. 
[00:27:30]  Just horrible.  I'd always have to shit.  I would always have to shit on the first day of school in homeroom.  Yeah.  Because I was a little nervous.  I used to have to make wee-wees really bad.  I could do the pee-pee dance in my seat.  You go to school with your new clothes?  You know, it's something that fades from your memory, but it was so fucking vivid that  for years it lasted was the smell of the first day of school.  Because it was all school bags and freshly waxed floors.  Right.  And the cafeteria had that fucking, like, mess hall smell to it. 
[00:28:00]  The classrooms.  Like, everything smelled like the first day of school.  That would last a week, but that's because the janitors had nothing to do all summer  except just scrub everything.  But, like, the old leather school bag and things, that also had a very distinct smell  that just stayed with you, like, even after you got out of school.  Like, you can remember that up until, I think, your 20s.  You're like, yeah, I kind of remember that.  And then it just goes away.  Like, I can't even recall it anymore.  Do you remember the smell of school when...  I recall the smell of high school girls now. 
[00:28:30]  You're getting to relive that.  That's the only thing I can recall the smell of.  Do you remember the smell of school in the summertime?  Every once in a while you would find yourself at your school in the summertime for some weird  thing.  Oh, yeah, for some weird reason.  Does that smell come right back to you?  Yeah.  I can't describe it, but just the smell of the school in the summertime.  This is what makes Stephen King as great as he is.  Like, he could describe...  We all know the smells we're talking about, but I can't find words...  Stephen King could describe both of those smells.  And make it macabre. 
[00:29:00]  Yes.  Macabre.  Macabre.  And just throw a little blood in there.  Yes.  Fucking cool.  I can't find the words, but both of those smells we know.  You know, fuck Stephen King.  That's what I say.  Oh.  I've been trying to get him on this goddamn show for years, and I don't even want to  talk macabre.  Macabre.  The guy is great at discussing pop culture.  Yeah.  I wouldn't ask him one dumb question about his books.  About any books.  I'm sure he's sick of talking about his books.  Movies.  But he talks about music and the internet and all sorts of... 
[00:29:30]  He's really good at pop culture.  I'd love to ask him where he gets his ideas.  Oh, where do you get all those ideas?  He'd walk up...  He'd get up and leave.  Do you have nightmares?  That's very scary for you.  Do your own books scare you?  Never scare yourself.  I'd love to ask him just the worst question...  Every question he hates.  Right.  I used to read every Stephen King book when it came out, and then a book would come out,  and it would be like 1,800 pages.  Oh, yeah.  God.  Come on. 
[00:30:00]  It's something like The Stand.  That was forever.  Yeah.  It was forever.  You're reading that one.  It was ridiculous.  Do you really have to have it this big?  It was just everybody was detailed, and all the character development and everything was  really good, you know?  Especially in The Stand.  Never read the Stephen King ripoff, Dean Koontz.  I don't like him at all.  Dean Koontz.  I got into him for a little while, and then I realized I never liked him.  No.  Never liked him.  Do you know why I didn't like Dean Koontz?  Because there was one thing I read where the character was crawling over a fence or across  this yard or something, and he had to get somewhere. 
[00:30:30]  And he didn't go into detail about how the guy did it.  He was just like, yeah, now the guy's under the window.  And I'm like, he cheated.  He really missed something there that Stephen King never would have missed.  It's like the attention of the guy.  I forget what it was, but I just stopped liking him then.  One little piece.  Good reason.  You should check out my old fraternity brother and fellow broadcaster.  He got out of radio a long time ago.  Michael Lamo.  Michael Lamo is a horror writer.  His name is Lamo? 
[00:31:00]  L-A-I-M-O, right.  That's a terrible name for us.  That's a horrible name for any occupation.  Hey, Lamo.  Exactly.  But check him out, man.  He's an old friend of mine.  I mean, we've lost touch, but we pledged together and started radio together.  Well, look where Opie ripped off his fucking Twitter picture from, though.  Michael Lamo's fucking...  You know what?  He might have got...  And he's holding a thing of mustard.  He has.  It's a candle, but...  Michael Lamo.  He's an old friend of mine, and he's doing very well with the horror genre.  Very well. 
[00:31:30]  He's blowing up.  Stephen Bayshore says no.  He prefers Samuel Dullard.  He's a fantastic author.  Instead of Michael Lamo?  Samuel Dullard.  I actually...  My horror book's coming out soon.  Uh-oh.  What's it going to be about?  About vampires.  How they invade a town.  That's scary, Jimmy.  Wow, that sounds really scary, Jimmy.  But that's been done many times.  How is yours going to be different?  Because there's a priest, and he's a renegade, and he has to stop the vampires.  Nope, that's been done, too.  It's a renegade.  But he can't, because he's currently fighting pedophilia charges in Edamame County. 
[00:32:00]  Edamame County.  There's a problem there with that, I guess.  That's right.  Vampires are biting people.  Good old Michael Lamo.  There's a name I haven't thought of in years.  Lamo?  But the guy is doing pretty well.  I've read a couple of his books, and not bad at all, man.  Good for him.  Not bad at all.  Anthony, the Jerry Lewis telethon.  We were just talking about school.  An institution here in this country.  Well, it used to be. 
[00:32:30]  It used to be.  I was listening to 1010 Winds on the way in, and went, holy shit, he did another telethon,  and no one cares.  Who knew?  No one fucking cares.  Growing up, that was a staple in the family.  You'd go over, like, Grandma's house on Sunday or something, and we'd have the telethon on.  And you'd be like, ooh, who's going to be on?  Who's singing?  What comedian is going to come out and do something?  As a kid, you would stay up and watch, remember?  Yeah, yeah, you'd watch.  Because Jerry actually would do the whole telethon.  Yeah, Jerry would do something. 
[00:33:00]  So you would watch him at three in the morning and see how he's doing.  Yeah, see if Jerry's still up.  Right.  Jerry.  And then there'd be rumors that a big star would be coming on, and you'd have to sit  around for that.  And then it just became like, it's so irrelevant having this television telethon that just,  with stars, who was some of the big stars on it this year?  Yeah, could we find who the stars were?  One other thing about that, wherever you went, Labor Day weekend, when we were growing 
[00:33:30]  up, it was on in the background wherever you went.  Yeah, yeah.  Even if it was an outside barbecue, you had some kind of clips of a TV somehow.  Something was going on, yeah.  It was just everywhere you went.  I can't stand the sponsors that come up, and it's like, we're here for McDonald's with  a check for you, for your kids, Jerry.  All right.  Get his kids.  Shut up.  You know what that's all about?  Jerry's been holding them hostage for two decades.  Because McDonald's, I guarantee, wants to drop out, but they don't want to be the ones 
[00:34:00]  that drop out.  With the big headline, I'll say, McDonald's finally drops out.  Oh, really?  Yeah, realizes no cure.  Right.  He wheels some kid out with a giant head, and they'd be wearing a Burger King hat.  Thanks to Burger King for caring.  It's a no-win for McDonald's.  He wheels some lump out in a fucking chair, and you have to stay.  By the way, we're just using McDonald's for this bit.  We don't even know if they're part of the telethon anymore.  I have no fucking idea.  McDonald's is usually a big corporate sponsor.  They probably do, yeah.  You got to think all these corporate sponsors were like, all right, we'll give you 10 years 
[00:34:30]  to try to figure this shit out.  And what?  I think this was the 44th year.  Wow.  44 years, and they're just stuck.  They're stuck doing this until Jerry dies.  So here it is.  2009.  Watch for appearances by Dolly Parton, Reba McIntyre, Tony Orlando, Charo, Charo.  Which is the original broadcast?  Yeah, I know.  This is the first telethon.  I was going to say, what is this, 1979?  Wynonna, Train, Bo Bice, Terry Fader. 
[00:35:00]  I don't know.  Comedian George Wallace.  Lee Greenwood.  Lee Greenwood.  Joshua Bell, accompanied by Frankie Marino, and of course, Three Dog Night, and many more.  Very relevant.  Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome Three Dog Night.  You know what the problem is?  What?  Why?  Who?  You know what the problem is with this?  The many more?  Yeah.  Should have been all the names you just listed.  Yeah, that was the many more.  It should have been to the many more.  It should have been like A-Listers and then many more, which would have been all these  people.  Because then they bring in like the fucking, you know, the Bronx High School fucking marching 
[00:35:30]  band.  Does their thing.  Oh, God.  What's the name right above it?  Yeah, I don't know.  Was that last year?  No, that was for this year as well.  Celine Dion, Kid Rock, Sugar Land, Ludacris, and dozens more, including celebrity co-hosts  Nancy O'Dell and Tom Bergeron, who is very harmless.  Tom Bergeron does the new America's Funniest Home Videos, which is just called A-M-V now. 
[00:36:00]  Or A-F-V.  Why do I have to abbreviate everything?  America's Funniest Videos, because they don't want it to be like the old video show.  Don't get confused.  Let's watch A-M-V.  What?  What?  They don't want to confuse it with the Bob Saget version?  That was a tremendous success for a decade?  Well, here we go.  Let's listen to some Jerry Lewis telethon audio.  We got a fine clip here where Jerry gets very upset at his sponsor, because their sign  is blocking his view of the donation total. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, Christ.  It's going to be wacky.  Yes.  Jerry?  Jerry, I think we have a toast.  Mr. Lewis, give you a look.  Woo!  There you go.  I'd give anything to see the number up there, but South Point put their goddamn advertisement  under it.  He says, hello?  It's okay.  So did Hitler. 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  The king of comedy.  Yeah.  And the broad was trying there.  Yeah, yeah.  She's like, Jerry, Jerry, take a look.  She had nice energy, excitement.  Jerry, what the...  But the motherfucking sign is in the way.  All right, Jerry.  You're cranky.  We understand.  Jesus.  Where's the clip?  Do we have that?  The faggot clip?  You should only get muscular dystrophy.  Now I got to go see that movie again. 
[00:37:30]  Got to watch it again.  Now, Jerry.  We got that?  We're into hour 18.  Look how good he moves that camera.  We got a son of a gun.  Hold on.  Can you pause that for one second?  Oh, yes.  Sorry, guys.  But Eddie Munster would like to ask me a question while we're on the radio.  What's that, sir?  No, he's not.  He's asking me questions while I'm on the air.  No, he didn't do this.  Why are you asking him questions?  I'm very sorry.  I was told by Kenny to kindly get the receipt for breakfast this morning.  So, I'm very sorry. 
[00:38:00]  Can he give you any other orders that may want to interfere with the show?  Not right now.  That couldn't have waited for, you know, a break or...  My deepest apologies.  Okay.  No one was out there to, like, pull you back in, huh?  Because I've seen...  I've noticed this about you a couple of times out that glass window.  So, you've almost barged in the studio a couple of times and had to have been held back by  certain people.  Yeah, I get very excited.  Yeah, you're one of those just barge in kind of guys. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Did you want to...  You can take these, too.  I don't eat these potatoes, but thank you.  No.  It's Kenny to Kenny.  It's Kenny who wants them.  Okay.  Cool.  Yeah, Kenny usually eats Jimmy's potatoes.  You're not wearing your name tag.  What was it?  Graham.  It's Graham.  Graham.  I'm sorry.  I don't have the giant name tag.  He's the guar guy.  Yeah.  All right.  He's got the guar guy.  You're jerking off the guar guy.  I jerked off the big penis.  Right.  You did.  Yeah.  I remember that like it was last week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'm very sorry again.  Well, don't mention it.  It's just a, you know, radio show that we were in the middle of.  If you need anything else for tax purposes, let us know. 
[00:39:00]  All right.  No problem.  Why does Kenny need a receipt?  Oh, no.  Kenny's out there.  Oh, boy.  Kenny's going to kill this kid.  Oh, shit.  Kenny's going to give him a talking to.  A talking to.  Perhaps a bit more.  Oh, boy.  If I may be so.  That thin, angry head just looking down at you.  Oh, God.  Those beady fucking angel fish eyes.  Wasn't he just drinking a soda on YouTube?  He didn't look like that kid.  So I wanted to hear the clip, but.  Where were we?  A little clip.  Oh, the Jerry.  Well, this is the Jerry Lewis clip that got him in trouble last year. 
[00:39:30]  Last year.  Or two years ago.  As much trouble as an old fucking, you know, 80-something-year-old guy doing a telethon  can get into.  Sure.  They really didn't give him too much flack for it.  Hit it.  We're into hour 18.  Look how good he moves that camera over.  You're a son of a gun.  Wherever I go, he goes, let's see what you do with this over here.  Oh, your family has come to see you.  You remember Bart, your oldest son? 
[00:40:00]  Jesse, the illiterate faggot.  No.  He tried to catch himself.  He just said faggot.  But he was going to say faggot.  Yeah, of course.  And it went faggot.  No.  No, yeah.  No.  Oh, I forgot where I was.  The illiterate faggot.  The illiterate faggot.  What is he thinking?  The telethon.  How do you not love old people?  Fucking kook.  Old people don't care.  Trying to raise money.  No.  He doesn't care.  Goddamn signs in front of everything.  God damn.  He said, right.  Well, this is how he ended this year's telethon. 
[00:40:30]  It's just terrific.  Hope it's a bullet.  Kenny, Gordy, Garrett, Bill.  Oh, my guys, I thank you all so much.  And the nicest thing you'll ever hear in your life is that when you're on deck with me, I  feel so damn comfortable knowing that you're all there doing what you do.  I want all of you guys to know my gratitude. 
[00:41:00]  And one day we'll get together and have a drink and then I'll give you a hug or something.  It's just getting lower and lower.  Well, that's God taking his soul.  I think it's just about over for Mr. Lewis.  How old is he?  He's in his 80s.  Oh, yeah.  He said one day we'll have a drink or whatever.  Yeah.  I bet you he's been working with these guys for over four years.  Oh, forever.  And he's going to finally sit down and have a drink with them.  Can we have a drink?  Right.  And then I'll give you a hug or something.  Or make a donation. 
[00:41:30]  You never know.  Uh-huh.  Hmm.  Are we going to take the lights down?  I really think so.  It would be better.  It's too much of an audience light that's shining in my eyes.  And with my new eyes, where are my glasses?  I don't need them.  What is wrong with them?  It's all the age.  It's all.  When you walk through a storm, keep your head up high. 
[00:42:00]  They can't.  And don't be afraid of the dark.  Joe can't keep his big steroid head up either.  At the end of the storm is a golden sky and the sweet silver song of a large.  Walk on through the wind.  Walk on through the rain. 
[00:42:30]  Though your dreams be tossed and blown.  Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart.  Is he getting all choked up again like he does every year?  And you'll never walk alone.  Walk on, walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart. 
[00:43:00]  And you'll never, ever walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on.  You will never walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on 
[00:43:30]  I'll go home and get your fucking  shine box. 
[00:44:00]  Frank Vincent wasn't very sympathetic  to him.  Ruin my party wheeling in like that.  Never  walk along.  A lot of people saying he sounds like Uncle  Paul.  Oh, well.  Like they could run away.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break? Jimmy's back.  Jimmy's back.  We got lots to do. We're just getting warmed up,  folks.  Yeah, David Tyree 
[00:44:30]  we'll get into.  We got a Buffalo Bill that  Danny's convinced is retarded.  Really? We'll have audio next.  Okay. That's your tease. Hit it.  Man.  Got a guy on hold here.  He saw a little Jimmy Norton over the weekend  in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Chris, what do you got, buddy?  Good evening. 
[00:45:00]  Good evening, Chris.  Hey, I saw Jimmy down in Cincinnati  over the weekend. Great show.  Is your mic on?  Oh, it was awesome.  We were sitting there  watching the show, though,  and  for probably 15,  20 minutes,  Kenny just hovered  over us  off to the corner  of the room.  Completely freaked  my girlfriend out  the whole time.  She just kept going,  why is he standing there?  What was one of you filming?  No,  not one of us were filming. 
[00:45:30]  He was,  he looked like he was  counting the crowd.  Oh, yeah, he counts the audience.  What's that?  Oh, my God.  You gotta get video.  Over and over again, I bet.  You gotta get video  of him trying to count that high.  One, two.  He's standing there,  like, hovering,  making everybody feel creepy  and nervous,  and then walking back and forth,  back and forth  with a little clicker.  Yeah, that's what he does.  He counts the room.  He can't help it.  He just has to.  Yeah.  All right, well, thanks a lot. 
[00:46:00]  Great show again, Jimmy.  It was good getting a picture  with you, too.  Thanks for coming.  Cincinnati was great, man.  I mean, they're hardcore fans.  We have fans down there?  A lot of fans.  I mean, I did not one piece  of press for that show  because I was gone.  Not one phoner.  Not one interview.  Kenny did a promo for me here.  Yes.  Yeah, we know.  And a couple.  I didn't even hear it.  I'm sure it was good.  Right.  Oh, boy.  And was it awful?  Oh, yeah.  It just went over and over again.  Where could you do press these days?  You can't get on radio.  Local radio. 
[00:46:30]  Because they're all doing jukebox radio  and fucking sports radio now.  No interviews.  No nothing.  And it was still,  the shows were really, really pretty packed.  I was very surprised.  Very good.  So, good fans in Cincinnati.  We saw him in Blue Heeler, I bet.  It was actually in Kentucky.  And he came up and he's like,  tell old Blue Heeler, said hello.  Like, this is how awful a fan's self-esteem is.  He wanted to go,  hi, Jim, I'm Blue Heeler.  Because I know you're too stupid.  But he was afraid I'd go,  who gives a fuck?  Right.  So, he had to go,  tell old Blue Heeler, said hi.  Right.  I would have been happy to see you, Blue Heeler. 
[00:47:00]  He's one of the Ubers.  Yes, he is.  We don't have many Ubers,  but he's one of them.  He's a real fan.  And Jimmy was like,  pouring his heart out to me a little bit.  And did you get the text message?  Here's what happened.  I might even have it saved.  We were just having a moment.  He texted me to say that Blue Heeler says hi.  And I'm like,  oh, cool.  He's a cool guy, whatever, blah, blah, blah.  And then I said something like,  looking forward to having you back on the radio.  Because it's been like three weeks.  Yeah.  Because we were gone for two.  Yes.  And I think Jimmy was gone before we went on vacation.  And then he didn't do it last week. 
[00:47:30]  So it's been almost three, three and a half weeks.  Let's start a little Jimmy.  So I go,  I'm looking forward to having you on the radio again or whatever.  And Jimmy then kind of pours his heart out like,  yeah, man, I just love doing the show.  Even with this Leno thing.  Oh, it's my favorite thing to do in my career is the radio show.  And he says, blah, blah, blah.  And then I just write back, yuck.  But the thing was this, though.  I didn't get the, because thanks to the iPhone,  I didn't get the text.  So I get two texts in a row from Ope. 
[00:48:00]  Like they came in literally at the same time.  And one just said, yuck.  And then right under it was the next text,  which said, you were supposed to LOL at that.  Like you think you probably thought that I got offended.  But I hadn't gotten the text.  So I just read, yuck, you were supposed to LOL.  I'm like, what happened?  Well, because that's me being anxious to see if I made you laugh,  because I'm such a zilch.  That would have actually made me laugh.  Because I'm like, yuck.  Because he's spilling his heart out on text messages.  I'm like, I know I got him.  I know he's going to laugh really hard at this.  Yuck.  It was a home run.  So I push it all confident.  I'm sitting there just staring at my phone. 
[00:48:30]  You know how you do that?  Waiting for them to write back.  Staring, staring, nothing, nothing.  I didn't get an answer.  Right.  So then I panicked and I wrote him, you were supposed to laugh at that.  I honestly did not get it.  And then he actually wrote back, at what?  I'm like, oh, great.  And then it turned out it was because both came at the same time or whatever.  Yeah, I thought I missed something.  But that's the iPhone.  I'm sure it was in your fucking phone.  But that'd be in your AT&T, too.  Let's go to Pat in Florida.  Pat.  Pat.  Good evening.  Hello, Pat.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you, Pat. 
[00:49:00]  Hey, Oak, can we get a Fur Fright costume update?  And maybe Jimmy can put his input in on it.  Oh, my God.  That's the only thing I live for these days.  What?  Fur Fright.  We are 38 days until Fur Fright 2009.  And our own Sam is going to Fur Fright, possibly as a blue dragon, with his coolie hole exposed.  We want his coolie hole to be cut out.  Yes.  So people can see his little coolie hole.  What is Fur Fright?  We don't really know.  It sounds like it's just a Halloween costume party, but it's a little more detailed than that. 
[00:49:30]  There's shenanigans going on.  It's like a Halloween costume party where you've got to wear furry suits, for the most part.  And there's these sexual undertones going on, like it's some kind of an orgy.  Yeah, you know how the plushies have sex with each other?  It's not an orgy.  It's a furry party.  You would have sent Steve naked.  That hairy Lebanese baboon. 
[00:50:00]  Look at Sam walking down the hall so slowly.  He doesn't want anything to do with Fur Fright.  And there's rules that they posted that are like no inappropriate touching in the hallways of the hotel.  So you know, like, they're just fucking going into the rooms and having these big parties.  And they say if you're having a party, don't make it too loud.  The only sign they should wear is, please don't strike us with a bat again.  That's what every one of them should have to wear due to incidents.  Look at that.  So Sam's going undercover to find out what happens at these Fur Frights. 
[00:50:30]  Blowing a guy at the Overlook.  Sam, where is the party?  In Waterbury, was it?  In Waterbury, Connecticut.  Waterbury, Connecticut.  Yeah.  Where is Sam?  Do we get a quick update from him?  There's no parties closer?  Waterbury's pretty close.  Well, for this extravaganza.  Yeah.  What do you have to dress as?  Yeah, this is a big one.  Do you have a Fur Fright 09 update?  No.  I don't mean no.  You said no update. 
[00:51:00]  You only have a week to tell us what your costume's going to be.  Yeah, what is it?  Oh, you don't know yet.  Is it the dragon?  I don't know.  I really haven't put any thought whatsoever into it.  I mean, I don't want to go.  You're going to blow the bit.  I mean, I don't mean to blow anything, and I don't intend to.  Do the bit.  Are you going to Fur Fright or not?  Well, you said I have to.  Yeah, you have to.  So, what is it, you know?  But you don't even have a costume yet.  Where am I going to get a blue dragon costume?  Oh, yeah.  Costume.  That's right.  He says costume. 
[00:51:30]  I know.  It's horrendous.  Why don't you just dress up as a blackout with 100% vitiligo?  A costume.  And a costume that you can cut the coulee hole out of.  I don't even think that's allowed at the convention.  So, your coulee hole.  Well, have a little hatch over it.  A little fur hatch that once you reach the room, the party in the room, you can just lift it up.  Yeah, easy access.  I'm not going to a room party.  We already went over this.  I have to.  You bend all the way over and then lift your panel.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  Why would you go all the way and not go to the big parties?  I'm not going to go to any.  You have to go to a room party.  If I'm there, it will only be in the main convention hall area.  No.  That's not where the fun happens.  One of the signs on one of those guys, I would love it if you wore this.  It said free hugs.  Yeah.  That's a sign you should certainly wear.  Could you wear a free hug?  I doubt it.  Look.  Look.  A sign around your costume.  You know how much those must stink, those costumes?  They're terrible.  Just sweating inside them. 
[00:52:30]  They haven't been washed.  Like that fucking Philly fanatic when he came into the studio that day.  Holy shit.  It just smelled like piss.  Holy shit.  It smelled like fucking old, rancid piss.  Yeah.  Lovely.  This is our update?  That's it?  Well, I mean, I told you.  This is not anything I'm interested in.  You had a long weekend.  You really could have done some work for the fur fright.  What kind of work?  I mean, I don't know where to.  Like figure out what costume.  Get your costume.  Well, I told you.  I don't have any place to go get it.  I'm certainly not going to purchase a costume. 
[00:53:00]  And you're staying overnight.  No, I'm not staying overnight.  How do you spell costume?  C-O-S-T-U-M-E.  Costume.  Costume, right.  With the short O and the S-T with the U, it's costume.  That's how it would be pronounced.  Costume.  Because it's a long U.  Costume.  Ah, well.  But see, like there's a wolf dressed as Elvis.  Like that doesn't even make any sense.  Well, I'm so glad you let us in on the fact that you don't know where to get your costume 
[00:53:30]  because we got Joey and Philly that will be able to help.  Joey, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hi, Joe.  I think it's a blue dragon.  But basically, after I heard it on your show, I went online and I just wanted to find out  if it was really as fucked up as you guys said it was.  Yeah.  And so I went into like a chat room and I was starting to read it.  These people actually think they're these animals.  Like, this one kid's like, he wears a tail all the time and they get together and they  just cuddle and rub and I don't know if they fuck or what. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, you could cuddle and rub.  You have to actually be your costume.  I don't want to cuddle or rub.  Oh, it's denning.  But it's straight.  It's not gay.  It's both.  It's guys, girls, and young.  There's plenty of girls there.  They're going to look like one girl would be there.  That hotel they're all in should burn like the Vegas MGM.  How great would it be to see guys in tiger outfits falling out of a fucking window on  fire?  But you have to be so ugly to fuck.  If you have to wear a fursuit to get some ass, you're probably not a good looking girl. 
[00:54:30]  No costumes in the pool.  I don't want to understand that picture.  You could rub your penis on other people's costumes.  I'm not going to.  Yeah.  What if I just wear like a goofy hat?  No.  Like, you know, at Disney World, they make the hats in the shape.  No, Joey.  No, you can't do that.  Look at this guy.  He's got a tail.  And then it says the end on the website.  It says his end because it's his ass.  It looks like a fox ran up his asshole.  He's got to wear a fur costume.  It's got to be like a mascot costume.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  Why are you saying costume?  It's costume.  Costume.  It's pronounced costume.  Joey, do you have a costume?  For Sam.  I have a company that we sell like catalog shit.  I can get to a wholesale, you know, charge you guys whatever.  Sam, what size are you?  But you're looking at, honestly, for a mascot costume, it's a company that doesn't really  surprise that.  So you're going to get like a choice of a chicken, a gorilla, a pink gorilla.  I mean, super chill.  Pink gorilla.  Someone out there has a costume they're not using anymore.  I don't want to use costume. 
[00:55:30]  I have an Elmo costume.  I'll go as Elmo.  No, I'm not going as Elmo.  Why not?  Because that way everyone will want to talk to you.  People will want to talk to me and tickle me and cuddle me.  I won't do that.  Go as tickle me Elmo.  Oh, that would be great.  There you go.  Tickle me Elmo is perfect.  It's a terrible idea.  No, why don't you, why don't we have listeners just start sending in their used costumes?  Ah, yeah.  Because I know people have costumes that are just laying around they'll never use again.  I like that one.  How about a ferocious gorilla? 
[00:56:00]  Put the key in the costume.  Huh?  It has to be a fur.  It can't just be like a book.  Start sending in your costumes so Sam can try them on.  But they're used.  Sam, whatever costume shows up, you've got to try on for fur fright.  I don't know if that's a good idea at all.  I don't think anyone would really send a costume, so you should be safe with this.  Wonderful.  But if one does show up, you're going to have to put it on.  Wasn't there a white one fucking hanging around the office at one point?  Oh, yeah.  We had a rabbit costume.  Yeah.  What happened to the rabbit costume?  Oh, that's perfect.  I don't know if that's good enough. 
[00:56:30]  I think I still have it in my cubby above my desk in the back office.  Can the coulee hole be cut out?  No.  We need it for other things, so we definitely can't cut out the coulee.  And the little cottontail cover up your exposed coulee hole.  Dude, the rabbit is perfect.  Of course it is.  I feel like that costume might have even got lost in the move, so.  Nope.  Oh, really?  Danny's getting up.  Danny knows where it is.  Would you try on the rabbit costume to see how it looks for a fur fright 2009?  38 days and counting. 
[00:57:00]  This is not exciting for me.  No, no.  It's great for everybody.  You do things for the listeners here.  You don't do things for yourself.  Don't be selfish.  All right.  Could you at least try on the costume?  You want me to model costumes for you?  Yes.  If it fits pretty well, I think we found your costume.  Oh, good.  Someone is saying, well, let this guy say it.  Sean in Illinois.  Sean.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I think for sure you ought to make his little cooter flap be Velcro, so when you  can rip it off, the party begins. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, Velcro.  Velcro.  That'd work.  You have the tail be over the Velcro.  Yeah.  Yeah, just grab the tail and yank on it.  And it's just this bare ass in there.  I don't think so.  No underwear.  You're naked in the costume.  And that lets everybody know the ass is coming out because they're like, and they're like,  oh, whoa.  That's like a mating call at fur fright.  There may be some undergarments.  No, no, no.  It's just your bare ass after that.  Let's go to Lowell.  Not the town.  The guy.  Lowell.  Thank God. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Lowell.  Yeah.  What's up, brother?  Speak.  Hey, man.  Didn't they do all those horrible CSI shows about all those animals?  People show up in the costumes, and they found semen in the costume, and had to do the whole  semen.  Oh, really?  Semen.  Hey, and is that rabbit costume the one from The Shining?  What's going on with that?  Yeah, I know.  We're looking at it right now.  This is the famous...  The guy's blowing the guy or whatever.  Well, this is...  That was a piggy.  Yeah, for the hardcore listeners, this was the famous rabbit costume that freaked out 
[00:58:30]  Bobby Lee.  He thought he was seeing an oversized rabbit.  Yeah.  Oh, it's all furry?  Yeah, it's perfect, Sam.  Go down the hall and try it on.  That is perfect, Sam.  Do the big reveal in a few minutes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hope he accidentally hops through the window and plunges 36 floors.  How great would it be for the fucking family to have to identify his body in that outfit?  That's a little dusty.  All right.  What is that bib for?  It's the vest.  Oh, it's the vest because you're like an Easter bunny.  Yeah.  Of course I am.  Oh, okay. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, my God.  You're a wreck.  Keep that bib on.  Any badges you don't swallow.  Don't get all over the costume.  Get on it.  Matting the fur.  Costume.  Costume.  Stupid costume.  Hey, the Giants released David Tyree.  That went on over the weekend.  Why?  He was so great.  He wrote a whole book on that famous catch that won the Super Bowl for the Giants.  What was that book called?  More Than Just a Catch.  Was it?  Yeah.  At this point, you've got to think it was, no, it was just a catch. 
[00:59:30]  They didn't know whether to put it in the football section or the fishing section or the disease section.  That's a stupid name for a book.  Remember how insulted he was because we did not interview him?  No.  We had E-Rock and Sam interview him.  Yeah, we had the franchise.  We franchised that interview.  See, we knew better.  Oh, yeah.  We knew he was a one-catch wonder.  Screw him.  Who wanted to talk to him?  One catch on the side of his helmet.  Wow.  Ooh.  Cared.  That could be the greatest catch ever, though. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, but I mean, it's done.  That was an insane catch if you really think about it.  Dude, what a moment that was.  Especially because it was Boston.  It was against Boston, against that dynasty.  Good one.  It was against New England.  Jesus.  Was it?  You're insulting New Hampshire.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah.  Rhode Island.  Oh, sorry, guys.  It's the Rhode Island Patriots.  Part of Connecticut.  Sorry, guys.  My apologies.  It's a team that's all of New England.  Where do I play?  Oh, right, Massachusetts.  Speaking of football, Danny has brought to our attention that a Buffalo Bill might be retarded. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know what this one's about whatsoever, so Danny, help me out here.  Well, I don't know too much of the backstory, but there was a press conference yesterday where this player was speaking,  and he was not speaking very well, and that leads me to believe that perhaps he is retarded.  What's his name?  Ellis Langsdale?  Yes.  I don't know this guy.  He's a, what was he, Travis?  A corner?  I don't know football.  He's a cornerback.  A cornerback.  I think this might be.  Corner or corner?  No, no, corner.  Corner.  It couldn't be a retarded quarterback. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, that would be.  All right, let's take a listen to him speaking.  Oh, hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Oh.  Hold on.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me get the big reveal.  First of all, I want confirmation that that's Sam, and he didn't just have an intern put that costume on.  Here comes Sam with the big reveal.  Yeah, I see his hair.  He's in the rabbit costume for Fur Fright 09.  Stupid you look.  If you want to confirm that it's Sam, you can see his back.  Yeah, I know, the ridiculous hair. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, his stupid hair.  Yeah, we're going to have to, like, hide the hair in the back.  What do you think, Sam?  Oh, the ears, Sam.  You've got the rabbit costume on.  It's very difficult to breathe in this.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Wait till you have a dick in your ass.  A corner.  What do you think, Jimmy?  He looks even stupider than I'd hoped.  That is pretty good.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good costume for that Fur Fright thing.  It fits right in.  I think you'd be a cuddly bunny that guys would want to hug.  Really? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  And now let me see where the coolie would go.  Yeah.  Turn around and bend over.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, see?  We cut that out.  Pink marks the spot.  Yeah.  Yeah, it looks like you have fucking pink socks.  Yeah.  It's a little pink fucking fuzzy tail.  Looks like you tried to lift a van and your asshole just fell out.  Oh, there's a rabbit weightlifter who needs an ambulance.  Sam, what do you think?  Is this the costume?  This is terrible. 
[01:02:30]  Are you going to use?  This is terrible.  I think it's perfect, though.  How do you see through the real eyes?  Oh, wow.  They're like one way.  I can't see your eyes, but you can see.  Can you actually see?  Yes, I can.  Maybe I'm winking at you.  Yeah, cool.  Maybe you are.  Can you see that?  Yes, you're flipping me off.  What about the hands, though?  You need, like, mittens.  Yeah.  You need white, furry mittens.  Yeah, well, we can work on the costume, but I think in general.  I think we got a basic outline there.  Absolutely.  I think that's really gay. 
[01:03:00]  I think that'll suit you very well.  Well, the polka-dotted vest really makes the costume.  That really makes the outfit.  It does.  It wouldn't be ridiculous enough without that stupid vest.  Yeah.  Who's going to go with me?  What?  What?  No one's going with you, Sam.  It's going to be big A.  We only have one costume.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Are you supposed to tuck that flap of the neck into the costume?  It's disgusting.  Yeah, that way it doesn't...  Oh, now it looks like you got a bloody head.  That's better.  And it'll be a lot hotter that way.  Yeah.  Do you like wearing that? 
[01:03:30]  No.  No.  Why don't you like wearing it, Sam?  It's uncomfortable.  It's uncomfortable.  Is it?  And it's hard to breathe.  Cut to the tail off.  It's hard to breathe.  Sloppy.  And it's warm.  Is it?  Yes.  All right.  Well, it's perfect for fur fright.  And my vision is impaired.  Well, that's good.  You won't be able to identify who rapes you.  That would be great.  You can't see behind you.  No, I cannot.  Yeah, that's good.  Once your head's in the pillow, it won't matter anyway.  How great would it be if he was wearing that while his girlfriend tripped on the Staten  Island ferry?  Oh, shit. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, you guys.  Sam's in intensive care.  I don't know why I want to see you savagely beaten by him.  I know.  In that costume.  In that costume.  I don't want to get beaten up.  All right, Sam.  Why don't you hop down the hall?  Because you've got to live your character, remember?  Yeah.  Hop out of here and hop down the hall.  There you go, Sam.  He's hopping.  He's hopping.  He's got big rabbit feet, so the hopping should be a piece of cake for him.  And there goes Sam, hopping down the hall, living his costume.  He doesn't really look very happy. 
[01:04:30]  He doesn't have much hop in his step there, does he?  I wish Mel would walk down the hall right now.  Just fire him.  Who is this?  Get him out of here.  Like with some investors.  Oh, fuck.  Like some big people from Liberty.  Yeah, it's like, who is it?  I don't know.  Get him out of here.  The stock is going up.  We run a tight ship.  That asshole hopping down there with a rabbit outfit.  Funny costume.  Stupid costume.  Well, that's good.  We got a costume for him, so now he can go.  Yeah, now he has no excuse. 
[01:05:00]  He's in.  All right, and so we go back to the Bills player.  I already forgot his name.  Let's see.  Do you remember Ellis?  Ellis.  Ellis Lockdale?  I'm going to go with that.  You just told us.  Oh, Langsdale.  Ellis Langsdale.  So he's speaking at a press conference.  Danny's convinced he could be retarded.  Let's take a listen here.  Did you peel off your assignment when you saw where the wall was headed?  Yes, sir.  How did that work?  Just walking through that.  Like, um, like, um, I just, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, like, um, I was on, like, um, like, um, I was on, just on, like, um, I was just reading, right? 
[01:05:30]  In the late round pick, how much of a system urgency did you feel you have to try to make an early impression and continue to be on that?  Well, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, I was a seven-round pick, so, like, um, so, like, um...  That's not edited.  That's...  No, no, no.  I can't believe that isn't edited. 
[01:06:00]  So that isn't, like, a montage.  No, that's not a montage.  There was two questions there.  Obviously, you heard it in the middle.  There was a second question.  That could be one of the greatest things I've heard recently.  There's no fucking way that isn't edited.  I think, I think we're all in shock.  So there's no edits there.  Wow.  I thought he, someone picked up on the fact he answers every question with saying...  No, that's not an edit.  ...saying like him one time.  Like him, like him, like him, like him.  Because I kind of thought it sounded, uh, fishy at first, but I saw the video and, like, the camera's moving, the background's moving. 
[01:06:30]  Like, you could tell it is a...  Wow, what is that about?  ...a clean piece of footage.  What is that about?  He's got, uh, some kind of, uh, problem.  It's a tick.  He sounds like he stutters like Big A.  It's just, he just...  And he's probably nervous, too.  Did you peel off your side when you saw where the ball was headed?  Yes, sir.  How'd that work out?  Just walk me through that.  Like, um, like, um, I just, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, I was just, like, um, I was just, like, um, I was just reading, right? 
[01:07:00]  In the late round pick, how much of a sense of urgency did you feel you have to try to make an early impression of the team to build on that?  Well, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, I was a seven-round pick, so, like, um, so, like, um...  I'm watching the video.  Like, um...  Like, um...  Like, um, like, um...  Like, um...  Wow!  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying. 
[01:07:30]  I'm not lying.  Like, um...  I'm not lying.  My brother never touched me.  That never happened.  That never happened.  Like, um, I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  That's a rumor.  That's a rumor.  Jimmy, you missed Bobo and Rich Voss trivia contest.  Jesus, Steve from Bay Area.  And Bobo kicked his ass.  What a bitch.  What a Steve.  I can't say it.  Oh, really?  And it's genius, though.  I heard about it. 
[01:08:00]  About the contest.  Now we have a new contest.  We're going to have a, well, like arm, like arm.  Like arm, like arm, like arm.  No, we're going to have Bobo write things down.  Because we learned he cannot spell whatsoever.  Bobo's spelling is, it's amazing.  It's not spelling.  We came up with another bit within a bit.  Yeah.  So he's going to come in and write some shit down for us.  Want to hear that one more time?  Like arm.  Like arm.  Like arm.  Did you feel off your assignment when you saw where the wall was headed?  Yes, sir.  How did that work? 
[01:08:30]  Just walk me through that.  Like arm.  Like arm.  I just, like arm.  Like arm.  Like arm.  Like arm.  I was on.  Like arm.  Like arm.  I was just reading, right?  In the late round pick, how much of a sense of urgency did you feel you have to try to  make an early impression as a team of the old man?  Like, I was a seven-round pick.  So like. 
[01:09:00]  Matt from Providence writes, I think he's saying, I like gum.  I like gum.  Oh, maybe he's got an endorsement.  Yes.  I like gum.  It could be gum or gun.  Every reporter is going to ask him every question.  Of course.  You stand on the bench this game.  How was it?  Well, I like arm.  I like arm.  I like arm.  I was sitting.  I like arm.  I want to hire that guy to do movie reviews.  He should do something.  Yes, he needs to be in broadcasting.  I wish I was a billionaire just so I could make him my spokesman. 
[01:09:30]  Like um.  Like um.  Like um.  Like um.  Like um.  Jimmy not.  Jimmy not.  Like um.  Like um.  He's going to be like um.  Like um.  He'll be appearing there like um.  Let's go to Paul in Tennessee.  Paul.  Hey there, Paul.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  This is not a fluke.  It is called the Southern Negro.  My boss gets stuck on um and darn for fucking minutes at a time.  What is it?  What is it though?  Is it like is it an autism or is it a stutter or is it OCD?  What is it?  I don't know, but it's irritating that he's in charge of competent um. 
[01:10:00]  You know, people.  There's got to be some kind of Tourette's I'm thinking.  Maybe.  I have no idea.  Do we have video of him doing it?  Who knows?  Yeah.  Like um.  I was just talking to him ten minutes ago.  Oh, it was like a fucking deja vu when you guys came on the radio with this shit.  Yeah.  There you go.  The only other documented case.  I got to tell you, that's a great find by Danny right there.  That's going to be the highlight of the show.  Rubes, what's up?  Hey.  How did all of our listeners call at once?  Oh.  What's up, Rubes? 
[01:10:30]  Speak.  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead.  Oh, there's another way to find out he's retarded.  You bent his back foot backwards.  Lingy lingy.  Very good.  That's for everyone that was listening on Friday.  Well, Mike in New York has a very good observation.  Mike?  Yeah, what a dick this guy is for asking a second question.  No kidding.  Oh, the reporter?  Yeah.  I got a follow-up question.  I got ten follow-up questions here.  Yeah, he knew he had gold right there.  Oh, swivel hips.  What's wrong with him? 
[01:11:00]  Can't watch him walk down the hall.  Yeah, the reporter had asked a second question for more like-um, like-um.  Like-um, like-um, like-um, like-um, like-um.  Uh, all right.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Coke Logic.  Coke Logic.  Ooh.  From Chicago.  Hey, I hear Oprah's shutting down your city to start her latest season of Oprah.  What?  I have not heard of you.  How do I know more about Chicago than Coke Logic?  She doesn't leave the house.  I get all my news- I get all my news from you guys.  I think it's today.  I think, um, I think it's the busiest section of Chicago being shut down. 
[01:11:30]  Really?  Oprah's saying bring your own seat, bring your own water, bring your own food, because you're  going to have to sit there five hours before I even broadcast.  Are you kidding me?  Yep.  God damn.  I think she's closing down like five blocks of the busiest section of, uh, Chicago.  I've never been to Chicago, so I don't know what those five blocks would be.  You've never been to Chicago?  I want to go so bad.  It's a fucking great city, man.  It's a perfect time to go, too, right?  So, how's your video doing, man, by the way?  Your cartoon?  Oh, your, uh, yeah.  Oh, dude.  It's getting, uh, it's kicking the shit out of the, uh, the other videos. 
[01:12:00]  Good.  It's the most viewed one in the contest.  Close to the Kenny.  He did a hell of a job.  Nice.  It's fucking awesome.  Good.  Hey, dude, I saw a fucking, uh, special on the Four Corner Hustlers.  You know that gang in Chicago?  No.  What?  Oh, apparently-  I watched Gangland, and they're-  Apparently, you just believe the gangs are running rampant all over the whole city.  How do we know more about Chicago than Coke Logic?  Coke Logic does nothing about-  Get the fuck out of those bars and look around a little bit, Coke.  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  Look at them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think I-  I really don't know.  Yeah.  I love that gangland.  I've never been there, and I know more about what's going on there today.  All I know is if anyone wants to see the contest video, they can go to tinyurl.com slash America  Day.  Perfect.  That's a nice tiny URL you got there.  Booyah.  That's perfect.  Yeah, I know how to work it, you know?  You can put your own tiny URL in there?  I thought you had to use the one they gave you.  No.  You can put whatever you want.  Fuck, I didn't know that. 
[01:13:00]  I'm a dummy.  As long as it's not taken, you can put your own tiny URL.  By the way, Coke Logic is calling from what has been voted as the most stressful city  in America.  Did you know that, Coke Logic?  Did you know that?  I did not know that.  What the fuck do you know about Chicago?  Followed by number two, L.A., number three, New York, number four, Cleveland, and number  five, Providence, Rhode Island.  Wouldn't Cleveland be number one with all those walking zombie homeless people? 
[01:13:30]  There's not enough people to be stressed.  They're just a couple of people milling about buildings.  Why Chicago number one, though?  Because it's really windy?  Of the four corner hustlers.  It's really windy.  I'm trying to see real quickly, but I can't, so I don't care.  All right.  Coke Logic, why are you calling?  We got the video.  I wanted.  Which is nice.  I needed an update on Bob Kelly and Opie's man vacation, man vacation, fly fishing. 
[01:14:00]  Bob Kelly's coming in tomorrow.  Jimmy doesn't even know this.  Bob Kelly talked me into going fly fishing with him.  Everyone thought I was going this weekend for some reason, but no, it's in a few weeks.  You do understand, with him, that goes through a glory hole, fly fishing.  He's obsessed.  He calls a zipper.  You know Bob Kelly gets obsessed with things, and his latest obsession is fly fishing.  He called me up to talk.  Well, he was on the show talking about it.  Then he calls me at home, and we're talking about it. 
[01:14:30]  Next thing you know, I felt like I had to book a fly fishing trip with the guy.  Fly fishing stinks.  He guilted me into going fly fishing.  And then he wrote me over the weekend, did you get your hotel room yet?  Where are you guys fly fishing?  In the Hudson?  In Roscoe, New York.  You're taking a trip to Roscoe to fly fish with that idiot?  Yes.  And he's talking about like, dude, you just told me you're there.  You're with nature.  Yeah.  You just, you know, you're so relaxed in a fly fishing.  Oh, I hope.  And you get it.  Oh. 
[01:15:00]  And he has a picture of him with a fucking three-inch long fish, which is like the only  thing he's ever caught fly fishing.  But he made it look like it could be a monster.  Yeah.  Because he had no scale.  What did he get?  A trout?  He had nothing to really scale it with.  Yeah, there was no scale.  So it could have been a two-foot trout.  But we didn't know until he finally made it.  It was only like seven inches.  I hope he's fishing and he hooks his own scrotum and casts his line in and flips face first  into the water.  The icy waters.  He said that he's calling it the Greg and Bobby fly fishing extravaganza.  Roscoe, New York. 
[01:15:30]  And who's the guide?  Oh, my God.  J.W. Trout.  J.W. Trout.  He hired J.W. Trout for the day.  Who's that?  It's a guide.  Who knows a lot about trout?  A guy that has to go fishing with you.  And if you try to call him just J.W., he gets mad.  He goes, his name is J.W. Trout.  There he is.  There's J.W. Trout.  And you'll be there in big hip waders, standing in the middle of the water, casting this little  fly that you have to make.  You've got to, like, make it.  He goes, dude, I made one with, like, my dog fur. 
[01:16:00]  Because I just clipped the little dog fur out, dude.  And he is so into this now, this addict.  I fucking hate Bob's attempts to find some meaning.  He travels to Guatemala.  Why don't you just look at...  I saw the ruins, dude.  Yeah, I picked up a trinket.  I could have bought in the airport and not had the threat of a beheading.  Stop trying to fill the vacuum, Bob.  You want to fill it, look in the mirror into those fucking dead shark eyes of yours. 
[01:16:30]  Those dead black fucking doll shark eyes.  Now, Jimmy, I have one more chance of this.  Tomorrow, Bob Kelly's in.  I think he's still getting tangled.  You've got to help me get out of this fucking thing.  Because I don't know how to get out of it.  He wants us to bring our girls, and they could go shopping for the day while we're fly fishing.  What are you going to buy in fucking...  What are you going to buy in?  I'm like, where are they supposed to...  Bus tickets to another town?  I'm like, where are they supposed to shop, Bobby?  Stop trying to, like, force friendship.  This is so difficult to do, first of all. 
[01:17:00]  Now the guy's just using a regular reel.  Yeah.  It's stupid, too.  Yeah, it's...  Look at it.  You're in the water.  Put a bucket down.  The point of fishing is you're on land, fish in water.  You catch fish, bring on land.  Look at this.  Look at all the line he's got out.  That would be all tangled around you.  I'm going to be so frustrated.  Look at all the line he's pulling out.  I'm going to be so fucking frustrated.  I can't do this.  And look how he's flipping it.  You don't just do that.  No.  You have to wear sunglasses so you don't fucking rip your eyeball out.  And that guy has hair like a psycho. 
[01:17:30]  The guy doing this has hair.  He has hair like he's trying to cover up a rape murder.  No one's hair is that perfect while they fly fish.  How exciting is the dialogue on that?  Is that the trout guy?  No.  No.  He's giving a lesson.  Fly fishing, the roll cast.  Let's hear about the roll cast.  And he's bringing the dogs.  He's just forcing a moment.  Oh my god.  Fly fishing Robin.  Young Howard Stern is fly fishing. 
[01:18:00]  This is WNBC.  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  That is so funny.  This is fucking double.  You put the line in the water, Robin.  When Howard had the short hair and just a mustache, we're looking at that exact guy fly fishing.  Wow.  That is fucked up.  He's got his finger on it.  He's showing you how to let the slack out.  Oh my god.  It is uncanny.  That can't be him, right?  You have to look twice.  That is funny.  Where's that video so they can check it out for themselves? 
[01:18:30]  That's YouTube.  Just YouTube fly fishing.  It's, I think, the first thing that comes up.  It's this strange person.  You'll see young Howard.  Short hair with the mustache.  That's how Howard used to.  That is fucked up.  That's funny, man.  That is way too close.  He's all tall and lanky, too.  That's the longest zipper I've ever seen on pants.  His fucking fly has got to be four feet long.  It's giant.  He's got to have a monster in those. 
[01:19:00]  He's all cocked, this guy.  Look at him.  This tiny head.  Who is this?  That's funny, man.  It does look like him.  That is fucked up.  Everyone's saying all there is in Roscoe is the diner,  and I'm supposed to bring my girl up there for the weekend.  You have to shop at a diner.  I'll have a fucking cruller.  What are you guys going to shop for?  And he wants me to get a room.  I'm like, Bobby, I'll go up there for the day.  I'll get up there early.  We'll fly.  But he wants the whole experience.  We get a room.  He's excited because it's free Continental Breakfast and free HBO.  So, I'm like, what are you doing, Bobby? 
[01:19:30]  Dude, we got to tell you.  It's a whole day.  It's a whole event, dude.  I'm doing it for the show.  I'm going for the show.  You know what, dude?  You get away.  You know what, dude?  We're in the city.  You live a little bit.  You relax.  You get in touch with yourself.  You have your cup of coffee.  I hate when Bob talks.  He has to throw coffee into everything.  We get it, shit dick.  You like coffee.  Whenever I talk to Bob, dude, you got to get Wi-Fi, right?  Boom.  You sit down.  You got your coffee.  I get it.  Don't describe what I'm going to do in my house when I have Wi-Fi. 
[01:20:00]  You know what, dude?  You're driving.  You relax.  There's a fucking breeze.  You got a coffee, a cigarette.  Shut your mouth.  Can we do our favorite bit?  Jimmy's invitation to Bob Kelly.  Bobby needs a subject.  Jimmy, you need a subject.  Fishing.  You know what, dude?  You get up there in the nature.  You catch your line out.  Bing, boom, boom.  You just kind of kick back.  They come up.  They grab it.  Yeah, what if the, like, water's cold, though?  Ah, dead, der, brr. 
[01:20:30]  That's fishing, Howie.  That was him.  I was fishing in Roscoe.  A big, fat idiot.  You got the original video of Howard fly fishing.  It's just, it's uncanny.  That is so goddamn funny.  It really is.  Come on.  Oh, that's the guy. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, son of a bitch.  Holy shit.  Dude, that is fucking really funny.  That's weird, man.  And he's switching back and forth.  There's no difference.  None.  All right.  You're going to be, how far is Roscoe from here?  I don't know.  Like, I used to drive past that all the time, going to Western Europe.  More than an hour?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Is it more than eight minutes outside the city?  I think it's like an hour and a half, two hours.  Oh, that's good.  I would guess.  But I'm going.  I'm in.  I don't know how to get out of this.  When are you guys going?  I don't know.  How do you get out of it?  You fucking give Bob the wrong address, so when he sits out in front of your apartment waiting,  you just don't ever acknowledge it.  And then he's sitting out there with a hat with a bunch of lures and fucking pins on it,  like fucking Henry Fonda.  We got to match the hats.  We got to do all this shit.  That's what should happen.  Match the hats.  Him and Don should go get a cabin, and then Bob should have to grab his chest and drop 
[01:22:00]  a bunch of dishes on the fucking...  Have a heart attack.  I hope Bob's fucking heart quits in the woods.  I don't know what happened.  And the ambulance can't get to him.  Wounds.  Well, I mean, if Sam goes to Fur Fright, I got to do the fly fishing, so...  What a fool Bob is.  Fly fishing with Bobby.  Oh, Lady Trucker's got something.  Yeah.  A lot of fat.  LT, what's up?  Good morning.  Yeah, you have a go, Opie.  Want to be fun to see how many times you can snag Bobby's hat and toss it into the river? 
[01:22:30]  I should just keep throwing his hat in the river.  You know what, dude?  The sun's getting in my eye.  He'll be smoking in the middle of nature.  It's beautiful.  Flick a cigarette in the water.  Or he could, uh, pee in the water.  What's that?  I heard you.  Why can't Bob just stop trying to find himself everywhere beautiful?  He really is.  You want to find yourself, Bob?  Go to Staten Island and walk off the West Shore Expressway, rifle through garbage.  You're more likely to be there than you are in the woods. 
[01:23:00]  You know what's funny about that whole thing?  Why does it annoy us that he's trying to find himself?  Because we know what a zilch he is.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  Dude, I'm in the Mayan ruins.  I'm getting in touch with my...  What are you doing?  He thinks it's like Indiana Jones or something.  He thinks he's special.  He committed an international crime, by the way.  You're not allowed to bring anything home.  Yeah.  What's wrong with this guy?  I went to Abraham's tomb.  Shut up.  What are you doing?  Go to the fucking Central Park and stand there and then watch two guys blow each other behind 
[01:23:30]  a tree.  That's your outdoor experience.  Everyone is saying there's nothing to do, but he insists the women go so they can bond  and shop.  That's what he wants.  He wants like a couple, you know, you're kind of bonding thing.  So if the girls get together, that way you and him and the girls can then go out later  at some other time and in the city, maybe.  Let me tell you something.  I'm married about nine months now.  We don't have couples friends.  I'm not doing the couples friends thing ever. 
[01:24:00]  I got my friends that she kind of likes.  I like some of her friends.  But when you throw in the other person and both the couples have to get along, I'm never  going down that road.  Nope.  Nope.  Especially when it's their friends.  Like I can hang out with Jimmy and his girl, but we're not like couples friends.  We're forcing it.  Oh, no, never.  And you know what?  You know, he probably asked Dane and Dane's like, you know, dude, I'd love to, but I can't.  You know, I can't.  I got another, you know, sold out arena.  I got to take care of. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, no, I had probably a, I had a very fun time with Jimmy and the lovely young lady.  It pretty much was a clan meeting in a hot tub.  What a mouth on her.  Oh, boy.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  She's a lullet.  Oh, my God.  Is she a catch?  You keep that, lady.  She's perfect.  Oof.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  We're having a good, loud conversation.  That didn't matter in my neighborhood. 
[01:25:00]  Not at all.  I also, I rolled, believe me, whenever we drive, I make sure all windows are up and locked so  fucking blabbermouth can't get my fucking windows kicked in.  Don't go on the Staten Island Ferry and have her trip.  Yeah, you don't want to have to defend your girl and end up in a coma.  That had a sock for that guy.  God.  What happened?  Staten Island Ferry.  Oh, we didn't talk about that.  Some guy's girl tripped.  I guess she had a little trip.  Yeah, they're getting on about 1.30 in the morning or something like that. 
[01:25:30]  This guy's been with the FDNY for, you know, about three years or something.  He walks on.  The girl trips.  And then I guess these two guys and another girl started laughing.  And he just turned around and said, grow up.  He goes, why don't you shut?  And one of the guys said, why don't you shut the F up?  Well, I can say shut the fuck up.  It is satellite.  Why don't you shut the fuck up before we kick your ass?  And they beat the piss out of him, kicking him.  And all three of them.  Yeah.  Now he's in a coma. 
[01:26:00]  And he's in critical condition.  And they can't find the people that did it yet.  Yeah.  Could you please, though, give a description of the people?  That's probably the best way to catch perpetrators.  It's to give a description of who did it.  Now, this firefighter's name is Matthew Dugan, 34.  I don't know.  They didn't know a picture of him, so I don't know.  I don't know.  Sounds Irish.  It sounds like an Irish kind of Matthew Dugan.  Matthew Dugan.  Matthew Dugan, come in here, firefighter. 
[01:26:30]  You know, I just want to know what type of thugs beat this guy senseless.  Yeah.  And put him in a coma for, you know, him just saying, you know, grow up defending his chick on the ferry.  But we'll see.  We'll see.  I'm not jumping to conclusions.  That was why I referenced Sam's girlfriend falling, by the way, on the Saturday.  I forgot we didn't talk about that.  So you might think I just want his girl to fall.  No, it's one of the big stories.  No, I wanted Sam to be beaten.  Right.  That's different.  Yes, in this plushy outfit. 
[01:27:00]  You know what, dude?  You're just going to drop the thing in there.  Boom.  We're going to catch some fish.  You know what, dude?  We'll cook him up.  Mr. Trout, JWPD Trout will show us how to do it.  JWPD.  JW, JW Trout.  You know what I'm going to do?  What?  I'm going to wreck the whole fly fishing weekend.  I just figured it out.  It would fucking kill the little boy.  I'm going to tweet my exact location when I get there in the fucking river.  The stream.  And what, two hours later, someone might show up?  That's a good point. 
[01:27:30]  It's like, it's in the middle of nowhere.  Maybe I'll have to tell them ahead of time somehow.  And what tweeting are you going to do in a place with no phone service?  Good point.  All right.  Why is he hiring that JW Trout?  That guy knows nothing about fishing.  Oh, my goodness.  Does somebody else maybe know about trout fishing?  Yes.  Ted's Fish Catchery.  Ted's Fish Catchery.  I guarantee you a fish.  How can you guarantee a fish?  Because I purchase one before we go, and I keep it in my pocket.  Oh, and you just put it on the hook and...  Yes. 
[01:28:00]  It's even cut up in fillet.  People are amazed at how quickly I do it in the water.  How are you going to get that fish on the line without the customer finding out there, Ted?  Well, I've had a few incidents where I drop it clumsily, and they see a dead fish floating.  And they say, why is there a newspaper wrapped around that fish that's supposed to be alive?  And I say, oopsie daisy.  How's business?  Business has not been good, Gregory.  Why not, Ted?  Because word got out that I wasn't very good.  I would just bring people in with giant buckets, and I would go yell, come here, fishy, fishy. 
[01:28:30]  They don't come to come here, fishy.  They certainly don't, Anthony.  Fishy, yes.  You'd think they would.  Why would you think they would?  I would stand outside the lake with fish treats and go...  They won't hear that either.  No, they don't have very good ears.  I should have known that.  They're like bird victims.  Holy shit.  Well, Bobby's in tomorrow.  Help me out with this fly fishing thing.  I'm in hell. 
[01:29:00]  Attack him for that.  I'm fucking in hell.  I don't know what...  Awful.  Maybe I'll cut his line in the middle of his dumb...  Is it called a cast?  What do they call it?  As he brings a fish up, cut his line.  When he's bringing a good fish up.  Yeah, nice big fish.  If we even get a fish, a bunch of people say, look, I actually fly fish.  I've been to Roscoe.  I've never caught a fish up there.  Fly fishing sucks.  Yeah, I'd like...  You need a good weight.  I like casting.  Yeah, yeah.  You gotta either cast far with a weight or just drop it down off a boat like three miles  down.  With a sinker.  With a sinker. 
[01:29:30]  A big bloop.  With giant hooks.  That was great.  The assailants were described as two men and one woman.  That's pretty much how they described the assailants.  Meanwhile, the girlfriend was uninjured, so she obviously saw them, knows what they look  like.  Yeah, I'm sure she described them.  Can you narrow it down just a little bit?  Describe just two men and one.  Yeah.  No description.  No height.  That really narrows it down to everyone in the world.  No height, weight, race.  Of course, no race. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit of race thrown in that might help to narrow it down.  Weight, height, hair color, what they were dressed in.  And something might ring a bell to somebody that goes, oh yeah, those people said they  were leaving a place and going to the ferry.  Just something.  Two men, one woman.  Great.  Real good use of the newspaper helping out society round up thugs.  You fucking pieces of shit.  Oh boy.  Well, I got to say, I don't know. 
[01:30:30]  I'm not drawing any conclusions.  That's what I'm doing.  I'm conclusionless.  We'll see.  I think that you are drawing some conclusions.  Right, I could be.  I know I've sketched a few at least.  You could be drawing a couple of conclusions.  All right.  Should we break?  I have to tinkle desperately.  Yes, and where's my sandwich?  I'm hungry now.  Where's that fucking red-faced kid with way too much hair?  Graham?  God, he has a lot of hair.  Graham.  I think he's wearing two Lego person wigs on top of each other. 
[01:31:00]  I used to have hair like that.  Yeah, right.  That hair loss will get him too.  It gets everybody.  But I hope his comes within a five minute span.  It gets everybody.  Yeah.  Nothing worse than losing your hair in a summertime.  You know what is weird though, dude?  I like the slow fade.  I'm going with the slow fade.  Yeah.  I had friends, man.  They had a full head of hair and by September they were done.  It's like done.  You get in your 40s and start losing your hair, it's one thing.  I've seen some of these interns. 
[01:31:30]  They're like 20 fucking years old with the fucking Phil Collins.  We're not the full Phil Collins look.  I don't think we're supposed to have more hair than the interns.  No, unless you've gotten follicles.  Well, even if you didn't have the follicles, you still had more hair than half these interns.  Yeah, some of these interns, they're under a lot of stress.  Yeah, really.  A lot of pressure, I guess.  Really.  Living with mommy and daddy.  Poor little fellas.  Titled fucks.  How many entitled fucks are we going to have around here?  Oh, God, enough.  Hey, we did a little sports for you.  You want to feel old?  We're talking about hair loss and all that and sports. 
[01:32:00]  Well, let me wrap it up with this.  How many years ago, Anthony?  Ten.  It was a big moment for baseball.  Mark McGuire breaks Roger Maris' fucking home run record.  Doesn't that feel like, I don't know, five, six years ago?  I would probably have thought five, six years ago.  It feels five, six years ago.  How long?  23 years today.  I want to say, I want to say.  This is going to be downright depressing.  14 years.  No way.  It's 11 years ago.  Holy shit.  So basically, just putting this in perspective, like rookie baseball players are now starting 
[01:32:30]  to see the end of their careers on the horizon.  How fucked up is that?  11 years ago.  It was fucked up.  That doesn't seem like 11 years ago.  Who saw that coming?  God.  Thanks, God.  Wow, that was funny.  Thanks a lot, God.  Kenny thought you meant him for putting his thing down.  That happened 11 years ago?  11 years ago.  So that would be 98, I guess, right?  I definitely would have put that after like 9-11. 
[01:33:00]  Dude, we were...  I don't know why.  We were just starting at WNEW.  Damn, yo.  I think we started in the summer of 98, didn't we?  Did we?  Coming back to New York for everyone's enjoyment.  I heard Carol Miller over the weekend.  Did you?  Still doing the exact same music breaks.  Getting the let out and stuff?  God bless her, man.  Is she getting the let out?  She wasn't getting the let out.  She was just introing records, man.  All right. 
[01:33:30]  The Boneyard, by the way, is still the best station ever.  Is it?  I was driving yesterday.  Kiss and then fucking Sabbath back to back.  I love the Boneyard.  I want to do a show for the Boneyard.  Not a full-time show, but like a one-hour show one day.  Why don't you?  They let me.  It's so weird.  Oh, they let you.  They don't like me.  This place is weird.  It's fucking bizarre.  I had the Boneyard on, too.  I got a little taste of Dio.  Yeah, Dio.  Singing about gnomes and castles and darkness. 
[01:34:00]  Dio loves that stuff, man.  Dio, what the fuck is that about?  Every song is about gnomes.  I know.  And the castles.  Yeah.  I'm going to mention that to him when I have dinner with him when I'm out in L.A. Wednesday.  Oh, what?  Really?  It doesn't matter.  Just me and my buddy, Jim Florentine.  And Ronnie James, Dio?  Yeah, whatever.  Rudy Sarzer.  But it is what...  You know how it is.  But it is kind of...  He does have that theme.  He likes magic and stuff like that a lot.  Magic?  I don't think it's even called magic. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, he signs it magic.  It's called wizardry.  Wizardry.  Dio sings about wizardry.  Yes, he does.  It's magical.  I would imagine he likes the Harry Potter series, Dio.  I would be interested to know that.  He probably does.  I bet you he does.  Why didn't we ask him that?  I don't know.  Stupid Michael Jackson tribute concert now?  Enough.  What?  Enough of this guy.  No, it was really depressing.  I was watching some Michael Jackson thing over the weekend.  Who cares?  You know the famous moonwalk?  Yes.  He fucking didn't come up with it. 
[01:35:00]  Who came up with that?  They showed some fucking dancer and said, yeah, I showed Michael Jackson the moonwalk.  And they got old footage from 1980 or whatever.  Was this the guy that wrote the Zeppelin tunes?  Yeah.  It was a black dancer dude.  He goes, yeah, I showed him the moonwalk.  I'm like, I really thought all these years that Michael Jackson just came up with that  on his own.  And that's why it was so over the top.  Damn.  And that's why it was a holy shit moment.  No, it was some dancer showed him the move.  In some dance studio.  And he brought it to, you know.  Original moonwalk performed in 1955? 
[01:35:30]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like the hat.  Look at that guy.  That guy.  What the fuck?  The original moonwalk performed in 19...  Yeah.  I'm just saying that again so they can see it on YouTube.  The original moonwalk performed in 1955 on YouTube.  Did you know that?  I had no clue.  Why the fuck were we all amazed when Michael Jackson did it on TV?  The moonwalk. 
[01:36:00]  Wow, 55.  That was...  So, fuck.  The guy that showed Michael Jackson didn't even come up.  That was Marvin Berry, as a matter of fact.  He's the guy...  If you look real close, you'll see Michael J. Fox.  That was the clock tower that got struck by lightning.  Yes, exactly.  That's why Marvin Berry's doing the moonwalk.  So, fucking...  The guy that showed Jackson didn't even come up with it.  No.  What was that guy?  What a hack Michael Jackson was.  What was I just gonna say? 
[01:36:30]  Wait, we were talking...  Moonwalk.  What were we talking about right before Michael Jackson?  Oh.  Michael Jackson...  I don't remember.  Dio.  Dio.  Oh, yeah.  It was after that.  Goblins.  It was after...  And gnomes.  Harry Potter.  No, it was Michael Jackson something.  Harry Potter.  Tribute concert.  You flying out to L.A.  Lunch with Dio.  No, it was after that.  I just had a thought.  Fly fishing.  And then you went on to this clip of the guy doing the original moonwalk.  I said...  Oh!  When Thriller came out, my friends, my Italian, like my white family friends, were gonna start 
[01:37:00]  like a little bit of a rap.  Like a breakdance group.  Oh, no you weren't.  Stop it.  I wasn't going to start it, but I remember being at a party that night, and I was drunk.  You were at the meeting?  And I was trying to dance a little bit to show them I could probably be in the breakdance  group too.  Can you show us a move?  I don't remember what I was doing.  Please remember.  I don't say...  I can't remember.  But yeah, I wanted to be a breakdancer at one point.  Of course you did.  With your Kango hat. 
[01:37:30]  Oof.  I just remember that.  Do you have a piece of cardboard?  What?  Did you have your own piece of cardboard?  No, my friend did though.  They had it.  It was pop locking.  My friend had big lips, and he would always get sun blisters on them.  That's me.  Did you get sun blisters?  Yeah, that was fun when I was eight.  Who the fuck gave me Herp Simplex 2 when I was eight?  I'd really like to know.  Oh, well, go full.  You got Simplex 2?  Oh, is that the bad one?  Oh, I don't want to say that.  I don't have that.  Okay.  I have the one that most of society has.  Oh, one is typically on the...  One is typical. 
[01:38:00]  Holy shit, I just used the wrong number, huh?  When we come back...  That's important.  Yeah, no kidding.  I would like to know.  I watched a movie that I loved when I was younger.  And then as you get older, you watch a movie you loved that you thought was so cool.  Oh, yeah.  And then you watch it later in life, and you're like, oh.  Ghostbusters.  Deuce chills all the way through.  Ghostbusters for me.  Ghostbusters for me.  Oh, I can't wait to hear what it is.  Did you see movies over the weekend?  I saw movies.  Jimmy saw movies.  I liked movies.  I watched...  Don't say which movie.  We'll talk which movies we saw over the weekend. 
[01:38:30]  Yes, I did.  Yes, yes, I did.  I saw two.  All right, we'll do that after the break.  That's it.  Okay.  Jimmy, I hate to put you on the spot, but we're going to talk about movies for like five or  ten minutes.  Could you come up with a off-the-cuff movies jingle just to set up this segment?  Turn down the music, Travis.  Oh, boy.  We didn't prepare this ahead of time.  We did not.  A movies jingle?  Yeah.  Oh, it's movie time. 
[01:39:00]  It's movie time.  Grab your popcorn.  Shouldn't you end with one more?  It's movie time.  Jesus.  I like your old-y time Hollywood kind of singing style in that one.  Yeah, why not?  That was good.  I think we're going to use that now every time we talk about movies.  I think so.  You want to give us a good take?  Okay.  Just in case.  Oh, it's movie time. 
[01:39:30]  It's movie time.  Go and grab your popcorn.  Because it's movie time.  I feel unfulfilled.  I need one more because it's movie time.  Oh, okay.  All right.  You leave us wanting more, Jimmy.  Here it goes.  Oh, it's movie time.  It's movie time.  Go and grab your popcorn.  Why?  Because why?  Why?  Because it's time for a movie. 
[01:40:00]  What a fucking asshole.  Shit.  All right, Jimmy.  What movie did you see over the weekend that you loved when you were younger?  You saw it again and you're like, ugh.  It's a movie from 1980.  I was just buying DVDs.  No, no.  It was drama.  Drama, 1980.  Was it an Oscar winner?  No.  80s rough.  Yeah, that's a rough one.  $5 I paid for it.  $5.  Wow.  And I used to record.  I used to sit in front of the TV and I would tape record scenes from movies just to reenact 
[01:40:30]  them.  Wait, wait.  On audio tape?  Audio, sure.  You are weird.  I used to tape Rodney on The Tonight Show when I was a kid.  All that shit, yeah.  But I would tape cursing scenes from movies.  I loved when profanity was used.  Yeah, that is the best part.  But the movie was Ray Sharkey.  Peter Gallagher was very young in this movie, too, who was actually very good in it.  Wow.  Ray Sharkey.  I don't even remember seeing that movie.  Was he the big star in that?  Ray Sharkey was the lead.  It was The Idol Maker. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, okay.  Do you ever see that?  Yeah, yeah.  Ray Sharkey plays a guy.  It's supposed to be 1959.  I thought the movie was Ray Sharkey.  Oh, no.  I swear to God.  I gotta wake the fuck up.  No, Burt Reynolds was Sharky's machine.  Yeah, all right.  I knew there was some kind of Sharky movie.  And George was a Sharky.  Yeah.  I saw that Sharky movie.  And it was about a guy.  The Idol Maker, no.  1959.  It was supposed to be 1959.  It was made in 1980.  And it's like, they're looking for these new teen idols. 
[01:41:30]  And he's like a guy from Brooklyn who discovers these local singers.  And the first one he makes big is Tommy D.  And the second one he makes big is Cesare.  And I was watching the movie getting so uncomfortable.  Yeah, a little douchey.  Oh, the whole thing.  Because he had a relationship with his mom, a friendship.  And, you know, Mom, you know, it's tough.  And he had this, his dad was estranged.  And he's like, you know, you weren't around for me and Mom.  Like, the dialogue was fucking terrible. 
[01:42:00]  Although Peter Gallagher was very good as the idol.  Cliche shit.  But it was so cliched.  Yeah.  The one part, though, the one singer he had, the song has been running through my head for  four days.  And it's so awful.  It's just, I've been up.  I've been down.  It's been stuck in my fucking head.  And if you Google the idol maker, it's like the guy in the white suit singing.  And it won't stop playing in my head.  Oh, man, there it is. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  The good old idol maker from 1980.  I can't say I remember that one.  You never saw the idol maker?  I've seen it, but I couldn't tell you.  And Tova Felsher.  You might have stumped Anthony finally.  He knows a little something about all movies.  I remember seeing this, though, because I do remember, what's his face in there?  Ray Sharky or Peter Gallagher?  Peter Gallagher.  Yeah, Peter Gallagher was good as the young idol.  But, uh...  Oh, God. 
[01:43:00]  I'm douching.  It was really douching.  We're looking at the...  Move on!  Move on!  I did it!  I did it!  I was the one out on that stage, right?  I was the one out on that stage.  I could prove I could do it.  And I did it!  I did it!  He's the one out on that stage!  And I was the one out on that stage!  And Vinny, will you give up?  Hang on, man!  I couldn't do it!  Yeah, I want you guys to be friends, huh?  Look at the outfit.  I'm the one out on the white.  My family.  My kids.  My guys.  That's bullshit, Vinny!  You're so caught up with that goddamn busboy kid, you're not thinking it was best for me. 
[01:43:30]  Hey, I can't choose!  I don't want to see that shit, Gino!  Maybe it's a race just for some reason.  What's that?  Oh.  See, the coming attractions are actually far less douchey than the movie.  Well, I could tell that this is really douchey.  It's just people yelling at each other.  The only good thing about Ray Sharkey is he could say, goddammit, better than anybody in movies.  Goddammit!  He said, goddammit, the best.  You hear that?  You hear that?  They love it.  They go straight.  I really think the kid's going to make it.  I really think he's got it. 
[01:44:00]  So don't you let me see a crime.  Let's see this shit.  This is a good trailer, though, for a movie that really annoyed me.  I don't remember this whatsoever.  Wow.  No.  That is horrendous.  Was that Marsha Brady?  Yeah, Maureen McCormick's in it, too.  I forgot about that.  Ray Sharkey actually died of AIDS in the 90s, and his girlfriend sues a steak because she  said he gave her AIDS knowingly.  Really?  Yeah, some weird story.  Ray Sharkey.  Good old Ray Sharkey. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, Ray Sharkey.  Oh, my goodness.  Only movie I could think of that is a douche chili movie that I used to watch and think  it was funny was Porky's.  I watched that recently because they put that on cable.  Does it hold up?  Ooh.  Ooh.  It is so incredibly bad.  And when it first came out, I guess, and was on cable, and it was on cable like first  came out.  Yeah, it was the shit when it came out.  It was one of those few movies that made the rounds when cable first came out, and they 
[01:45:00]  played movies on cable.  You'd be like, oh, yeah, this is great.  New chicks, and it's funny, and dick jokes, and everything.  And then you watch it now, and it's just...  I've got to watch that one again.  ...not funny at all.  Ghostbusters.  I think Mike has it on line one.  Let him say it.  Mike, go ahead.  How you doing?  I would have to say the all-time cheese ball is Scarface. 
[01:45:30]  As great an actor as Al Pacino is, I watched that last movie as a joke.  No, it's not.  It seems a bit dated.  I watched it recently, like maybe a couple of days ago even.  I think, yeah, I had it on like a couple of days ago.  And it's not that bad where you're just...  There are so many moments in it that you like seeing.  Yeah.  Like I like when he walks in, and Frank is there after the hit went wrong, and Mel is sitting 
[01:46:00]  there with me.  The premise of the movie is good, but if you think about it, it's pretty bad.  Sometimes things just happen, Tony.  There were some great moments in Scarface.  The blood and stuff that the Palmas direct, all right, that needed work.  Yeah.  And some of the things, like the montage scene with the tiger sucked.  But you know what?  Him walking.  The brutality in that was great.  Yeah.  The fucking, the scene we're on, and now they're laying again.  That's still one of the best fucking scenes ever, man, when that guy is, he's chopping  his friend up with a chainsaw. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Scarface montage.  It's a montage.  Dang it, dang it, dang it.  That's terrible.  This scene where he shoots all these guys is great.  When Gina gets shot, it's great.  He kills Manny.  Yeah.  That's a great scene.  He's killing people.  That is a great scene.  That's not dated.  It's your horse.  This song is not that great.  No.  This is really that.  They should just put a new song in there.  Omar getting hung out of the fucking, uh, Omar. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  You're right.  That's what they should do.  Put a better song.  Why not?  Has that been a tiger roar?  I like when he says, I never trusted Omar.  And he points to where Omar was in the air.  Yeah.  You can see his capped teeth.  Tony Montana had perfect teeth for a Cuban refugee.  That's great when a guy falls down with a chainsaw.  I love the scene of Sosa and Tony laughing on the phone with each other.  What are you talking about?  Just killing people.  Am I talking about throat stiff cuts?  Omar's dumb face when he was hanging from the helicopter. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  They're laughing.  That's a success.  I love this where he shoots the fucking guy in the head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the car.  That was good.  And comedian Angel Salador from the backseat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The counting.  Yeah, montage of them.  I like Fernando.  He's nice.  Take her in the toilet.  Like taking her to make out the toilet.  Toilet.  Welcome to the limit.  Limit. 
[01:48:00]  Take it maybe one step more.  Yeah.  People who can't see the montage out there are just being forced to listen to this song.  I know.  Isn't that funny?  We forget that.  And the montage is only half over.  There's some great scenes.  Only half of it.  When Tony comes out, look, is it hokey that he would have gotten shot that many times  before he fell down?  Of course.  But he was doing so much cocaine.  Yeah, but you don't even mind that.  Dude, the shooting.  That big gun is so great.  Yeah.  I think it's the music that dates it.  The grenade launcher.  Yes.  And some of the blood scenes are a little lame. 
[01:48:30]  Well, the one good thing is they remastered the sound on the gunshots.  Because that was the worst.  Was it bad, the gunshots?  Horrible.  Why?  The original, they all sounded like the same.  The machine gun sounded the same as the pistol, sounded the same as the other.  It was horrible.  So now they remastered the gunshots, and they actually sound beefier.  You're right.  They should put another song in there.  A fucking another.  What are you going to do Lucas the whole thing and fucking do it over?  What are you going to add in CGI fucking banthas? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Make it.  It's done.  Jar Jar Binks fucking newling heroin.  Why not?  They're always doing that with DVDs anyway.  Just have a completely remastered version with different music and gunshots.  With the original version.  Maybe try to, like, make the blood a little better.  A little Notorious B.I.G. or something playing instead of that hokey 80s shit.  Now they're like, yeah.  Hey, we got breaking news, guys.  Oh, no.  Jimmy, you got a breaking news jingle?  Oh, God.  We need all our jingles.  Oh, fuck.  We got to pump up the production on this show. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, there's news a-breaking.  Right.  I like it.  They're not all hits, folks.  It's short and sweet.  And terrible.  One of our favorites, the Naked Cowboy.  We all enjoy the Naked Cowboy and his tighty-whities.  Do we?  Fucking asshole.  God, I hate this Naked Cowboy guy.  Remember he was running for mayor?  Of course.  And the news was taking it very serious. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  And the press was...  He did a press conference in Times Square as he was being the Naked Cowboy.  Oh, it was funny.  We got an update.  The Naked Cowboy is now shedding more than just his clothes.  Robert Burke has dropped out of the race for mayor.  How is he shedding something?  Yeah, what is that shedding?  Is that shedding anything?  God, they couldn't come up with anything?  Who writes this shit for them?  How about the Naked Cowboy is pulling out for real?  Of the mayoral race.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, see? 
[01:50:30]  That would work.  The Naked Cowboy is now shedding more than...  Can we get a bell for every dumb little pun or whatever?  Oh, Naked Cowboy puns?  Yeah.  We got one at least.  I'm going to go with five.  This audio is only 30 seconds long.  I'm going to say she gets five.  Five in.  The Naked Cowboy is now shedding more than just his clothes.  Robert Burke has dropped out of the race for mayor.  The scantily clad guitar slinger announced his bid as an independent back in July.  He says he's calling it quits because he's had enough of the red tape that goes with a run for mayor. 
[01:51:00]  He says the city's Conflicts of Intersport fined him $250 for failing to file a required financial disclosure form.  But Burke's political aspirations have not been completely stripped away.  A spokesman for his campaign says the Naked Cowboy will pursue public office in the future.  No, he won't.  It was a publicity stunt.  Anyone can say that.  Pull him out on it and say it was a dumb publicity stunt.  This happens pretty much all the time.  And he's one of just millions of people that have done this. 
[01:51:30]  Stop.  Why are you taking it seriously?  Like he really was going to be the mayor of New York City.  Yeah.  Like he wanted to even be the mayor of New York City.  He doesn't want to be the mayor.  He got publicity.  You know, I have to go back to the movie thing because I watched 88 Minutes over the weekend.  First time?  No, second time.  I think I had gotten it.  Somebody had sent me a screener copy before it even hit the theaters.  And then I just watched it again. 
[01:52:00]  And it is so distracting now to watch any Pacino movie because all I look for are the platform shoes.  He's running up the stairs and I'm just concentrating on his feet.  It's like Denny Terrio.  Look at my shoes.  Yeah, the big platforms.  Tick tock.  Tick tock.  So bad that movie.  It was good, right?  Horrible movie.  It was good, right?  It was really not good.  At one point he's running outside and the wind has his hair blown up.  It looks like a shark fin.  It's giant. 
[01:52:30]  It's the wrong color for a man of his age.  Yeah, it really.  But he's got a jet black beard and mustache.  And like this kind of weird black graying hair.  But oh yeah, tick tock.  Tick tock.  It was so bad.  The sound my shoe platforms make when I walk.  Like tap shoes.  When did you realize the movie was bad?  You ever sit through a movie and you're in a theater and it takes about 15 or 20 minutes  and you're like, oh my god, this thing's never turning around. 
[01:53:00]  When I saw Al Pacino over the age of 35, that's when I went, this movie's going to suck a dick.  I went and saw that because I knew it was going to be bad.  It had been released in Brazil or something.  The previews for it was such cheese and such nonsense.  I'm like, I have to go see how bad this is going to be.  So that saw Quarantine.  Quarantine.  Yeah, that's the movie where a bunch of people are in this building with some firefighters and a cop. 
[01:53:30]  And they quarantined the building because there's some kind of super rabies in there.  Super rabies.  Super rabies.  People get like super rabies.  Which was kind of cool.  I'll take the soup.  Oh, stop.  Or rabies.  I get it.  The sister from Dexter was in it.  And she was obnoxious in it.  And then people just, I'm watching it and I'm just yelling at the screen at people because of what they're doing and not doing.  And I know that's like a horror movie thing.  You go, oh, don't do that. 
[01:54:00]  Don't go in there.  But they're just making ridiculous mistakes and errors.  Well, if they don't make the ridiculous mistakes, then you have nothing to watch.  No, make the other things more creative.  Don't make people have to fuck up so severely just to get killed.  Why would you go upstairs?  Yeah, just don't do that.  Don't grab this.  Barricade yourself in somewhere.  Don't fall down.  Don't fall.  Oh, you fell down.  That annoyed me.  The monster's chasing you and you fell down.  And a movie that had been out for a while but saw it.  And I like this movie.  John Cusack, 1408. 
[01:54:30]  The one with the hotel room.  That was scary.  Room 1408.  I thought it was kind of creepy.  It was a real thrilling, suspenseful.  I like the whole scene with him and Samuel L. Jackson.  Kind of Samuel L. Jackson trying to talk him out of going into his room.  He's an author.  He writes those hacky books on, you know, a haunted hotel.  The ten most haunted hotels.  And he just sits there knowing this is bullshit.  But he writes how creepy it is and everything.  And 1408 is just haunted.  He's like, what is it?  Haunted?  What goes? 
[01:55:00]  And Samuel L. Jackson just leans over and goes, no.  Oh, it's just an evil fucking room.  Which is really good.  Creepy little kid.  Creepy little kid is the...  Creepy little kid.  That's all the rage.  Hey, someone's on the line saying that Gloria's bastard sucked.  Did you see that yet, Ann?  Really?  That's a movie I think you would leave your house to watch.  No.  Why would I leave my house?  Well, because it's right down your alley.  You got the Nazis and, you know...  Yeah, I know.  But the Nazis are getting...  You got the blood.  You got the Quentin Tarantino.  I see a lot of Nazi hate in that movie.  And that bothers you, right? 
[01:55:30]  It was, you know, something...  Bygones be bygones.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  No, I haven't seen the movie yet.  I'm waiting for a copy of my house.  This guy says it sucks.  Rick in Ohio.  Rick?  Yeah, how's it going, boys?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I went to saw this movie.  Took everybody to go see it.  My dad came in from out of town.  I took my parents, my wife, my kids.  Spent $75, $80 on this fucking movie.  And it fucking sucked.  45 minutes of the Inglorious Bastards actually performing their shit in a three-hour fucking movie. 
[01:56:00]  The rest is film noir bullshit that Quentin Tarantino got fucking thrown into.  It sucked.  My problem with the movie, you know Hitler, you know...  Bought the farmers, they say.  He doesn't buy the farm in Inglorious Bastards.  How could he?  Not in an assassination.  Yeah, well, so then the whole movie, you know they're not going to actually get the guy.  So what's the interest of the movie?  It's all the killing the other Nazis, I guess.  They do.  They get everybody.  They kill everybody at the end.  But the guy! 
[01:56:30]  And you know that going into the movie, like, oh, they're not going to get the guy.  Oh, is it?  Or is it like some kind of conspiracy that they really did kill Hitler?  Oh, really?  A little...  Are they flipping it a little bit?  I don't know.  Well, it was 45 minutes of actually a good movie and another two hours and 15 minutes of bullshit.  Man, a lot of people love that movie there, Rick.  I'll have to see it.  I'm not just going to take your word for it, sir.  All right.  Yeah, I'll see it.  I finally saw The Prestige over the weekend, thanks to Danny, who's been trying to turn 
[01:57:00]  me out to this movie for years, because I saw The Illusionist.  Ah, right.  And I finally saw The Prestige and absolutely loved that fucking movie.  That was a damn good one.  That is a good one, man.  That was a solid flick.  I like that.  Yeah.  What did you think of David Bowie's performance as Tesla?  I liked it.  It was a short part.  I thought it was good, yeah.  I thought he was great.  I thought he did a good, mysterious kind of wacky job.  Yeah, I thought he did very, very, very well.  And then the other guy was the guy that was, what was he, Gollum and fucking Lord of the 
[01:57:30]  Rings?  You know, I entered, you know, the future a little bit here.  My PlayStation 3.  I finally rented a movie off PlayStation 3.  No way!  First fucking one.  How'd that work out for you?  Shitty, because Michael Caine's fucking accent is so horrendous.  I had to go subtitles, and I couldn't get subtitles.  It pissed me the fuck off.  But in The Prestige?  I rewound so many times, especially in the beginning.  It's hard to understand.  It's The Prestige!  Yeah, The Prestige!  Bayon's is a bloody double! 
[01:58:00]  Double!  It's so over the top.  So over the top.  I thought it was pretty funny there when Wolverine, I just go Wolverine.  When Wolverine's a double, it's like the drunk guy.  Oh, that was great.  And of course, D-Boy's impression.  Oh, yeah.  One of the only impressions that D-Boy does.  D-Boy does a nice impression from The Prestige.  Is he here today?  He should be.  Let me go see.  I would love to see that.  We're finally talking about The Prestige.  We've got to get D-Boy in here today.  D-Boy's impression. 
[01:58:30]  He's fantastic.  I swear.  He does these impersonations.  I swear.  You would think it was the real people.  You would.  D-Boy.  Someone just gave away glorious bastards on this and feedback.  Thanks.  I assumed.  God fucking damn it.  I assumed.  Damn it!  D-Boy.  Yeah.  I already saw the movie.  Oh, did you?  No.  What are we watching?  No D-Boy?  No D-Boy.  No D-Boy.  We don't get the big impression of The Prestige.  Which one does he do?  He does drunk?  No, he does Borden when Borden sabotages Angier and he pretends like he doesn't know what's 
[01:59:00]  going on and he just goes and then he sees the great Danton up, you know, hanging from  the ceiling and goes, oh.  That's all he does, too.  That's his whole impression.  Him just going, oh.  D-Boy's a douche.  So you think Tesla got fucked by, was it Edison?  By Edison?  Yeah.  They had a little competition going?  Yeah, Tesla kind of was crazy, though, too. 
[01:59:30]  The more you learn about Tesla, you realize that that guy might have been the main dude.  But Tesla was kind of crazy because he was coming up with all these kind of like rays,  like death rays and sonic death rays and electricity that travels through the air but could be used  like microwaved from space.  And Edison went commercial.  Yeah, and Edison was just like...  And that's why we know Edison more than we know Tesla.  But Tesla had alternating...  Signs, signs.  Tesla had alternating current, right?  And Edison had direct current. 
[02:00:00]  You're just making that up.  You don't know.  Of course I do.  No.  Yeah, Jimmy knows his stuff.  No.  It's not the thing I know.  It's current.  Yeah, you know current.  You bet I do.  He's good at current.  They don't call me current McGillicuddy for nothing.  Didn't...  McGillicuddy.  Nikola Tesla.  I also saw Harold and Maude over the weekend.  Ah.  You remember Harold and Maude?  I do.  With that old bitch. 
[02:00:30]  What was her name?  Ruth Gordon?  Ruth Gordon, yeah.  Hell of an actress.  Mm-hmm.  What a weird movie, though.  I don't know what to think of Harold and Maude.  I know.  I know there's a tent in your underpants.  You're like, I don't know why.  That was weird.  Well, it was some young guy with a...  And then some old bitch ready to show on a deathbed kind of a...  Well, she was ready to go.  They were go-getters.  Yeah.  And they had something in common.  Did they fuck in the movie?  I don't remember.  I think they did.  Yeah, they did.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a little weird.  Yeah.  They show the after-sex scene.  He's just all aglow in bed, and her hair's all askew next to him. 
[02:01:00]  And she's sleeping.  Why don't you slip your cock in me?  She sounded like Patty.  Right.  Yeah, she had a little patty to her.  She had a patty cadence to her voice.  Yep.  I want to see the new Rambo, though, because you guys know we have the movie synopsis here?  We do.  This can't be real.  It is.  This can't be real.  Stallone is such a cheese ball.  Can't be real.  In a voicemail to Harry Knowles of ain'titcoolnews.com, give them a little plug today, Sylvester Stallone  discusses the finer points of Rambo 5, the savage hunt, which involves Rambo, and a 22-year-old 
[02:01:30]  sidekick fighting a half-human abomination created by a renegade agency through a series  of outlawed genetic experiments.  Monster movie.  Oh, my God.  They've turned Rambo, of the Rambo franchise, into a monster movie.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Predator, pretty much.  They wanted to do kind of a Predator movie.  Why don't you play somebody else?  Yeah, exactly.  Make a new character.  No Rocky, no Rambo, just fucking, you know. 
[02:02:00]  And go.  If you want to go back to a character that worked really well, how about Cobretti?  Bring back Cobretti.  You're a millionaire.  You're a millionaire.  Why don't you just stop with those two fucking guys?  Yeah.  Enough Rocky, enough Rambo.  We've had enough.  You're embarrassing yourself.  We're done.  Nobody wants to see a 60-something-year-old man with kind of a hair lip chase a monster. 
[02:02:30]  Why?  It's a zombie.  Man, get back here.  It's going to be a zombie movie.  Zombie movies are hot right now.  No, is it one monster or a bunch?  See, let's find out, because here's Sylvester Stallone talking about it.  No way.  I appreciate you posting that, but I think there's been one slight confusion because of  all the talkbacks.  I think a majority of these individuals misunderstood.  It's not a universal soldier.  It's not me fighting some super soldier. 
[02:03:00]  It's actually a feral beast.  It's a thing.  It's this amalgamation of fury and intelligence and pure, unadulterated rage.  It's before men became human.  Oysters.  This is when they were still inhuman.  And so what he confronts is something that is everyone's virtual nightmare, but in no sense  of the word, does he go against, quote, the Dolph Lundgren or Claude Van Damme universal 
[02:03:30]  super soldier?  This is, he's going against a feral beast that has absolute cunning and intelligence and  a will to survive that is only matched by Rambos.  And that makes it uniquely different.  It's like the man's conscience fighting his dark.  Don't make it more than it is.  Uncontrollable subconscious.  Very similar to the plot in Forbidden Planet. 
[02:04:00]  Do you know how many people have had to listen to this boring fucking pitch?  It's pure, unadulterated rage.  It's boring, sly.  It's fucking boring.  What's the problem, man?  Sounds like he's got a good movie on his hands here.  It's a feral monster.  A feral monster.  What are you doing?  What it's going to be is a feral monster.  And she's got the same sort of rage as Rambo.  So what we're going to do is talk in a monotone voice to it until it lulls to sleep. 
[02:04:30]  And then I will walk away slowly into the distance.  And someone will yell, bring a good supply of body bags.  Hey, sly.  I put myself to sleep.  What?  Yes?  Yeah.  Your movie idea stinks.  All right.  How about this one?  Uh, Rambo works at a caddy shack.  And he takes people out.  And then the caddies go crazy and go in the pool.  And Rambo finds a dirty floating in the pool. 
[02:05:00]  Don't know.  Fucking do it.  Somebody should.  Just don't fucking do it.  Wouldn't you love someone just have the balls to just say to him, this is a joke, right?  You're shitting me.  You're an older gentleman.  Yeah.  We're not even at the end of the voicemail.  He might bring it.  And how about shoot if movie's over?  But he might bring it all together.  He might bring it all together here.  Come on.  Let's give him a chance.  The plot in Forbidden Planet, where the doctor couldn't control his mind and his subconscious 
[02:05:30]  took over and became a savage killing machine.  Well, it's very similar to this.  So I wish somehow...  You know what it sounds like?  Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly trying to explain, dude, it's not a monster.  This is the voice Bob Kelly thinks in.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very similar to what you say Bob Kelly sounds like.  I'm thinking of a movie where two gentlemen go fly fishing up in Roscoe.  And then what happens is there's a beast in the water. 
[02:06:00]  There's a beast that's, you know, as crazy and wild as Bob Kelly.  And only Bobby can take him down with a lure that he made out of his dog's hair.  And he hooks him with it.  And then he just talks and talks and, again, bores it to death.  It's about a monster, dude.  It's just an amalgamation of rage and horror and terror, dude. 
[02:06:30]  And it just latches on to Dane's fucking coattail.  Oh, wait.  To control his mind and his subconscious took over and became a savage killing machine.  Well, it's very similar to this.  So I wish somehow, or even take this message, you could convey to people that what they assume is Stallone or Rambo battling a squad of super soldiers.  It's just the opposite. 
[02:07:00]  It's your worst nightmare.  You're battling your primitive self, which has a lot more cunning and power than you could have ever imagined.  So that's about it.  Anyway, thank you.  Bye.  He is going to fight himself.  It's going to be a Rambo lookalike that is more primitive than Rambo.  Are you kidding me?  That's what I'm guessing.  God, that sounds fucking horrendous. 
[02:07:30]  Fantastic.  That really does sound horrible.  Why don't you enjoy this part of your life?  Yeah.  Why don't you take some acting risks?  You're Stallone.  Nobody wants to see.  It's like you've proven yourself.  You've been a big star for 33 years.  Yeah.  Why don't you do so?  Why don't you play a dad whose son tells him he's gay and he has to figure out how to handle it?  Why don't you play anything other than this? 
[02:08:00]  The Jim Norton's dad story?  You know, I really wish I hadn't used that example.  No, of course.  You just end up ruining your own franchise.  Just embarrassing.  Leave it where it's at.  I got another idea of where it's Rambo actually going up against Rocky.  I play a dramatic dual role where I can be twice as inane and boring in one sickle movie. 
[02:08:30]  Maybe we could go to the zoo and see the tigers before your fucking placenta falls on the dog food bag.  God, that's an awful movie idea.  Ugh.  Enough with the Rambo.  We get it.  We get it.  It worked during the Cold War.  We were all like, woohoo, get rid of the commies.  Now it's like, woohoo, get rid of the commies.  It's an Obama joke.  Speaking of Obama.  Yes.  We're going to talk about Van Jones after the break.  Yo, motherfucking Van Jones! 
[02:09:00]  You liked his Van Jones?  Did I like him?  I loved him.  You love Van Jones?  Oh!  We're going to get into the Van Jones controversy.  That's a great clusterfuck he was.  Boy, he said some things, huh?  Oh, was he...  Boy, every word out of his mouth just really made people want to embrace him.  Ugh.  Kevin Smith has 1.25 million fucking followers on Twitter.  Does he really?  He was just on the news.  He's doing a tweet-a-thon, right?  He's over a million followers? 
[02:09:30]  1.25.  Yeah.  One and a quarter.  Maybe we should call him and see how his tweet-a-thon's doing.  He's a popular guy.  He was going to tweet for 24 straight hours, but I think he's up to 36 hours.  36 hours.  Is he still awake?  What do you mean tweeting for 36 hours?  People just asking questions and stuff, and he's just kind of hanging.  He's answering.  With the peeps.  He's definitely awake.  The last Twitter he sent out was two minutes ago.  Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz?  Shaun of the Dead.  Shaun of the Dead.  Shaun of the Dead here, but I love Fuzz, too.  Kevin Smith.  Hot Fuzz is good. 
[02:10:00]  Shaun of the Dead, though?  It's the first one.  Yeah, it's very funny.  That's got to be tough, because it's 140 characters.  Do you guys see it every two minutes for 24 hours?  Huh?  Yeah, he's tweeting.  As soon as the questions come in, he's answering them, and he's filling up everyone's Twitter.  Yeah, really.  Can't get anything done right now until he's done.  I'll take a quick break.  Maybe we'll talk to Kevin Smith.  That would be nice.  And we'll also get into the Van Jones controversy as well.  Opie and Anthony with little Jimmy Norton.  I must say, also, hi, Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:10:30]  I've got to say, for anybody that's been watching shows like Hoarders and...  What channel is that on there, Danny?  Hoarders.  A&E.  If you've been watching any of those shows, you know, Forensic Files, things like that, 
[02:11:00]  boy, they sure don't show the commercial for that little girl with the bleeding eyeballs enough, don't they?  Holy shit, enough with the bleeding eye, girl!  When is that on?  Like, Sunday or something?  The girl who cries blood.  Yeah, it's some...  I don't know.  She looks Indian or Hindu or something.  Why does she do that?  I don't know, but it's like, wipe your fucking eyes!  They show her blood, like, pouring out of her eyes and shit, and it's smeared on her face.  Get the kid a paper towel. 
[02:11:30]  I'll wipe it up.  Yeah, this Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern.  So sick of seeing that.  Nat Geo.  Which is National Geographic to most people.  Nat Geo.  Yeah, I'm so sick of seeing the commercial for that fucking show.  God.  I can't stop looking at John Fogarty's...  Horrendous wig.  That wig.  He was here at 6XM Friday.  I thought it was a football helmet.  Jesus.  There's a bad wig on my head. 
[02:12:00]  Love the John Fogarty.  Don't love the wig.  That wig.  Some guy's gotta just let it go, man.  Gotta let it go.  It's terrible.  You think he's bald under there, Jimmy?  I don't know what's going on.  Maybe it's not a wig.  Maybe it's a bad dye job.  Or maybe he's got one of those toupees that he kind of brushes into the rest of it.  It looks too stiff in the back.  When he leans forward, the hair in the back leans perfectly with him.  Just goes up.  It's like a stormtrooper helmet.  Well, you know he looks like what Peter Cushing... 
[02:12:30]  What did they wear on the fucking Imperial Starship?  As stormtroopers?  But who are the fucking British guys?  They all dress like Peter Cushing in the original?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The little black helmets?  That fucking wig is awful.  If it's a wig.  If it's his real hair, he should shave it.  Yeah, then...  And get a wig.  Get a wig.  Because that looks brutal.  We're trying to figure out our favorite John Fogarty song.  And it went with Fortunate Son.  Oh, and Fortunate Son.  I think that one is the shit as far as...  I did a little run through the jungle. 
[02:13:00]  Jimmy?  I mean, it might be Who'll Stop the Rain.  Who'll Stop the Rain?  I also love...  You gotta love Proud Mary.  I mean, come on.  It's a great tune.  I think Anthony nailed it.  Fortunate Son is just...  It's a great one.  That's a good one.  That's a song.  And it's like one of those that have been used in movies and really like you go, oh,  shit.  There are songs that just get you...  This is like right here.  Yeah.  And I think it's been used in a movie right now.  Choppers flying over fucking the beach.  I'm getting chills.  I think it was Forrest Gump.  Yes, it was.  I believe you're right. 
[02:13:30]  Forrest Gump used this.  Yeah.  It's one of those songs that just gets your blood going.  This is one of those great, like, Vietnam fucking songs where you just see Huey's shooting  the shit out of animals in black pajamas.  What year did they break up, CCR?  Oh, God.  Who the fuck knows?  Jesus, Jimmy.  Did somebody...  Why is he walking around with a fucking wok on his head?  There's no reason for that.  He should take off his hair and stir fry vegetables in his... 
[02:14:00]  He's promoting.  I know he's a joke for someone else.  I don't remember who.  He wants to look like everyone remembers him.  Yeah.  CCR broke up in 72.  Get the...  Jesus.  Did they ever get back together?  They had to have.  Going solo.  You know, we got Kevin Smith on the line.  He doesn't want to hear his babbling about CCR.  73 to 84.  Then what did he do?  He retired?  I don't know.  That was 85 to 96 solo.  Ladies and gentlemen, that Kevin Smith on Twitter is on our phone line.  Hey, man.  What's up? 
[02:14:30]  Hey, Kevin.  Oh, my God.  How the fuck are you doing, man?  Now, I heard you're doing a tweet-a-thon.  You wanted to do 24 hours, but now I'm hearing you might be up to like 36 plus hours.  No.  Holy shit.  I started at 8 a.m. L.A. time yesterday.  It's only two hours from now.  It'll be 24 hours.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  All right.  It's still a long time.  Hey, man.  I've got a life, too, you know.  I've got things to do.  We're just discussing John Fogarty's headwear.  I don't know if you've seen his wig, but it's not good. 
[02:15:00]  I didn't see it, but you were reaching for...  Hello, Jimmy.  You were reaching for the term Star Destroyer Commander or Death Star Commander.  Oh, you heard the...  Yeah, I was.  I could not remember.  How do you know?  I don't think I've been able to call in since we've shot, have I?  You did aces, dude.  I see you quite often in the footage, and you're in the movie still.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thank you.  Very, very convincing.  Really held his own.  Held his own.  It was great.  Oh, thanks, man.  I'm glad to hear that.  Jimmy holds his own a lot.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah,  I hope I stay in. 
[02:15:30]  Boy, Kevin.  Why do you want to take something beautiful and turn it into a fucking wiener joke?  It's what they do, Kevin.  They just spoil things.  Make shit all over everything.  We do.  Well, a lot of controversy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The fight between you and Bruce Willis.  What the fuck?  Dude, what the fuck?  Somebody was like, hey, man, read this.  And I was like, oh, God, yes.  I remember this.  No, wait.  I didn't, because there was no, there was no, what are they called?  Rap party?  Yeah.  Sorry, it's late, and I've been up for about 21 hours.  Yeah, you've been up for a while.  22 hours straight. 
[02:16:00]  There was no rap party.  No, no, there was no fucking feud.  What am I, retarded?  Why would I fight with one of my stars?  Yeah, exactly.  Just to explain further, the National Enquirer X marks the Bruce.  When the new Bruce Willis flick, A Couple of Dicks, wound up with a rap party in New York.  The only absent member of cast and crew was Bruce himself, which surprised nobody, because  the star and director, Kevin Smith, had clashed nastily.  Nastily?  An eyewitness says, Bruce high-handedly made creative changes to every single one of his  scenes, stomping on director Smith, who let him get away with it because he's Bruce Willis. 
[02:16:30]  When Smith stood at the rap party to make a toast, he bellowed, I want to thank...  Oh, stop, stop.  It's such a painful walk down memory lane.  It all really happened for real and for true.  Stop it.  It pains me to hear.  I want to thank everyone who worked on the film, except for Bruce Willis, who is a fucking  dick.  Wow.  And that just didn't happen, right there, Kevin?  I've got to say, dude, if I was going to fucking sink it, I'd sink it on a better quote  than that.  Yeah, really. 
[02:17:00]  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, I'd go for a real Neil Armstrong, kind of like one giant step for mad guy.  I'm not going to go out on, hey, he's a fucking dick.  Just a fucking dick.  Anyone could be.  He's a dick.  Yeah.  In February, you know, no way.  Anyone could be a fucking dick.  I just didn't feel that way.  Dude, I'm a stoner.  I don't fight with anybody.  Yeah.  You're going to be brawling.  When I'm like, give me the pot back.  And I can speak as one of the guys, kind of maybe a co-star in the film.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton.  Being on set with Bruce, it was, no, he was very nice.  He was nice to everybody. 
[02:17:30]  He didn't shit talk.  He wasn't like unpleasant.  He was very, like, he was nice to everybody in the room.  He wasn't a dick to anybody.  He was.  And also, you know, look, this is where I think some people are like, oh, friction, friction.  This dude is a 25-year veteran.  He's done this movie a zillion times over.  You go in there and, you know, sometimes you're just like, you've got to change direction in what you're doing or change, you know, the plan.  Because you're like, oh, my God, he's done this exact same scene in this movie. 
[02:18:00]  Or I can't present this shot to him because he's seen it before.  You know, he's got to switch it up a bit.  But that was no, that's not like a fight.  And I wasn't even induced by him.  That was just kind of insecurity of like, oh, how to impress dad, so to speak.  More importantly, I think coolest helmets in Star Wars were the guys that actually ran the weapon on the Death Star.  Yeah, the dudes who pulled a crank, pulled on down, like he's doing a Gretzky score kind of move. 
[02:18:30]  Yes, cool fucking helmets.  They had like that weird little underbite or something going on.  And I'm sure that cool helmet saved his life when the fucking Death Star exploded.  Why father wearing the fucking helmet?  Why does a dude have a helmet in the middle of a planet?  You know, it's like, it's not even like, hey, man, I'm ollieing this fucking, like, Wookiee in one of the hallways on this star.  He's just chilling at a post.  Yeah, he's sitting there, you just got to hit that lever and blow up a planet. 
[02:19:00]  They have artificial gravity, obviously.  Everything's going to work out, but you take the fucking helmet off.  And wasn't Peter Cushing wearing like a Burger King paper hat?  Like he had nothing protecting his head.  He had nothing.  I did just want the chrome dome kind of.  And he had like lozenges as medals on his, like you could pull off his medals and pop it through the back and eat a cherry one.  They all look like little lozenges.  George Lucas is like, keep mocking my movie all the way to the bank, you fools. 
[02:19:30]  Exactly.  So what's this 24-hour tweet-a-thon all about?  I don't know, but you're pulling me away from it, man.  For the last 22 hours, I've been tweeting, and it's been fun.  No, it's dopey.  I mean, I did it primarily to promote the book that's coming out called Shooting the Shit with Kevin Smith.  And also to promote the zillion fucking tours I'm doing, Q&As that I'm doing between now and Christmas.  I've got a pretty extensive fall tour. 
[02:20:00]  It's like 15 dates.  I fancy myself something of a young, fat Jimmy Norton.  So does Jimmy Norton.  You've seen me lately.  I'm taking to the road and whatnot.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  So I've just been tweeting.  No news.  Any good questions coming in from the followers?  No, I mean, constantly interesting.  Constantly interesting enough to keep it going, right?  Yeah.  Nothing like where I'm like, oh, my God.  Well, there was one, and I forget what it was because it was hours ago.  Oh, would I ever cheat on my wife with my wife's evil twin? 
[02:20:30]  I did like that question a lot.  Oh, that's a good question.  That is a good one.  And it was just like, they're all softballs, right?  Which I get to just smack out of the park in that one.  I was just like, what?  There's a good twin?  That's fucking good.  See?  It's just, you know, sometimes I feel like fucking Marty Ingalls.  I'm working shtick now.  I'm literally working wife shtick on Twitter.  What happened to me?  I made clerks.  Yeah, what happened?  Come on.  It's twittering.  Hey, are you going to be in L.A. this week?  Of course. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, because I'll be out there.  Maybe we can grab some lunch.  Why don't you come over to my house, Jimmy Norton, and watch your scene.  Watch the whole flick.  Holy shit.  How cool is that, Jimmy?  I would do it, although I have so much shame.  I don't know if I could actually watch my scene.  I probably would watch it, but I get very embarrassed.  I can do this for you, too.  I can edit your scene out of the movie and let you watch it that way.  Yeah, there you go.  Then again, no need to do that, Kev.  Let's not be harsh.  You better get your ass over to Kevin Smith's house.  That was Mormon kind of screenings where I take all the bad stuff out.  If you don't do lunch with Kevin Smith, he's going to cut you out of that movie, Jimmy. 
[02:21:30]  No, I would love to see Kevin.  Not at all.  You can please pass on lunch with me, dude, unless you're willing to sit around and get  high and look at me.  I'm all Jabba-like at this point and shit.  Just laying on.  All that's missing is I even got that little salacious crumb thing.  It's that fucking Doction Shecky.  Just sits there like, ha, ha, ha.  I lay on my side all the time.  I get my wife in a metal bikini.  It's done, dude.  The Jedi has fucking returned.  How do you get so much work done?  Like, if you just smoke pot, like when I smoke pot.  Functioning stoner, dude.  Really?  Sir Frogan introduced me to the concept of functioning stoner. 
[02:22:00]  I will love that dude for no other reason than that for the rest of my life.  Or until I die of lung cancer.  I could never do anything.  We asked him about you, and I'm trying to remember what he said.  Fuck.  He was like, Kevin who?  Kevin James?  He totally on that show.  He does take credit for turning you on to pot.  He absolutely takes full credit for that.  That's very funny.  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  I can't remember exactly.  There was something that was pretty funny about that.  Anyway.  You're off making the Hornet now, right? 
[02:22:30]  Hey, man, can I pimp an event that is so unrelated, but off the top of my head, but it's New York,  and it just makes a lot of sense?  Of course.  We're doing live Smodcast in Red Bank.  Me and Moj.  Damn.  That's huge.  When is it happening?  I'm sorry.  Let me pull this up.  It is happening.  God, you would think I would know.  9-27, September 27th.  It's too far away.  It's about three weeks away.  Okay.  And you can go to the VSQ site, or you can just go to tinyearl.com slash smodlive, all 
[02:23:00]  one word.  Smodlive.  But it's fun, man.  We did it once before up in Brantford, Ontario, during the Gretzky tournament.  Me and Moj, it was killer.  This room is much smaller.  It's only like 350 seats, so it's way more intimate.  But come see it, man.  This is the last time we're doing it for a while.  Kevin sounds so tired.  I know.  I love the time.  But you sound like that.  No, Rick, dude.  I just realized, too, that I've taken too much time away from this Twitter thing, man.  Guinness is going to be like, fuck you. 
[02:23:30]  You didn't do it straight.  You were on the radio.  Hey, yeah.  Let's let him go.  He's a big guy.  Go tweet there.  I'll see you in LA next week.  Please do, dude.  Just literally, you have my contact stuff?  No, but I can get it from Steve.  Get it from Steve.  And please do.  Don't be a pussy.  I'll definitely.  Don't get out of here and be like, all right, I don't want to bug him.  Just fucking call.  You kidding me?  I'm Billy Bug.  I'll be fucking happy.  I'm going to show up at your house with luggage.  Who's that creepy man?  I'm like, I told him not to be a bitch about it. 
[02:24:00]  And he took me real serious.  He sure did.  Watch for the open invites.  He's Billy Bug.  He wasn't kidding.  I'll definitely do it.  Please do.  All right, buddy.  All right.  Bye, guys.  There he goes.  He's tweeting his ass off for $24.  It's funny to hear him stoned.  I've never heard him like that before.  He sounds so fucking tired.  Tired and a little stoned, right?  You know when you feel like that, you're just kind of like, I can't even talk.  He's like slurring his words a little bit.  That's all right.  He's a million Twitter followers, man.  1.25. 
[02:24:30]  I guess because he comes in here and anybody that remembers my name, I don't assume could  be famous.  Like, you fucking forget how famous because he's such a regular guy when he comes in and  hangs out.  But he's a famous shooter.  I really love about him, man.  He's just a regular guy who comes in and does the hang.  Hey, Obama, let's get into this Van Jones thing.  Van Jones.  What's up with Van Jones?  Woo!  What's up?  He's out.  He's out?  Out and see.  This guy opened his stupid commie yap one time too many.  He's a commie?  So you get along with him?  He is a complete commie. 
[02:25:00]  Like, self-professed.  A jackass.  He opens his mouth every time he says something.  It's stupid.  And I can only imagine the Obama administration just is horrified with whatever he says.  Why did Obama pick him then?  Because Obama is a socialist who wanted to have another like-minded, at least socialist,  if not communist, in charge of this green jobs thing, which then stretches out into other 
[02:25:30]  areas where, if you listen to a lot of what Van Jones said, he wasn't just looking at it  as a green jobs post.  He looked at it as a stepping stone to just about revolution.  This guy was pretty hardcore, especially in his younger days.  And he's like, well, I've apologized about anything I've said that might have offended  somebody in my past.  Well, that doesn't write you a free fucking ticket.  Other people have said things and they hold it.  Well, you think, you know, what's his name?  David Duke, when he was running for office, could say, yeah, I said a lot of stupid things 
[02:26:00]  in my past, but, you know, get over it.  You were the grand wizard of the KKK.  How great is it to see the far left being forced to step down because they said things  that were offensive to some segment of the population?  Having to deal with that shit that they doled out all these years.  And now it's like, you're not impervious.  Nope.  You know what?  You're not impervious.  You can't play the race card every time either, which is another big thing. 
[02:26:30]  It's nice to see that even somebody of color, if they're an asshole, they get thrown out  on the merits of being an asshole.  Asshole.  Not just, you know.  Well, Anthony, that was a terrific setup, I got to tell you.  One of the best in recent memory.  And at this point, you would play the audio of Van Jones, but we can't.  Why?  What happened?  Well, you might have heard in the background of your fine setup me slamming the door of  the CD player over and over again.  Oh, no.  This thing isn't going to play.  You've mentioned that before. 
[02:27:00]  This one ain't going to play.  Is it the CD or the player?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  It's been playing other CDs.  Is there mayo on it?  I even did this.  Oh, you did the old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  By the way, Obi-Wiart's CD on his stomach on his shirt, that's never worked in CD history  because I've done it with everyone that won't play and it never helps.  No.  I wanted to hear that too.  It doesn't look greasy.  Because he said some really stupid stuff.  Well, maybe the boys could run us another copy.  We could do a little stall.  We could punch him in the dick.  What is this about? 
[02:27:30]  What?  Intern Graham handed this in.  What the hell is this?  Punch him in the dick by Juicy Carcass.  There's another funny song on SNL.  Submitted by new intern Graham.  So this is Graham's first submission to the program of something he deems humorous.  Yeah, when he's not collecting receipts.  Yeah, in the middle of the show.  Oh, can he get him a talking to?  Did he?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I would have liked to have heard that.  Really close to breaking out the old phone book.  Kimmy looks like a 1950s guy taking an ear test. 
[02:28:00]  He's got his headphones on, his dumb big glasses.  You think he's just amazed by the computer and what he could do?  He stares at it.  I swear to you, the way he stares at it, it is just a miracle to him.  It's like watching somebody go to the, like watching old codger go to the first world's fair.  I guarantee he's doing stuff on that computer that we did 10 years ago, but he's finding out for the first time today.  I never see anything but just text.  Like there's never anything with any form of graphics.  The graphics card goes, ah. 
[02:28:30]  When Kenny takes the computer, he goes, ah.  I'm going to take a little nap.  Take a little rest.  Yeah.  What are you doing on the computer?  Did you see the beautiful picture that Jimmy Twittered about me?  Oh, from the airport?  Yeah.  You look like a fucking psychopath.  You look mentally ill on that picture.  You do.  You look like you should be taken by somebody and led everywhere.  Yeah, what was wrong with...  Like a retard.  You were at the airport.  Nothing.  Looking mentally ill.  But just look at his face.  That's just his look.  That's nothing.  He's miserable.  That's what I was staring at in the fucking terminal. 
[02:29:00]  Oh my God.  Just his head tilted and just a psychotic look on his face.  Why are you looking like that, Kenny?  He was sitting across from each other.  Why is that?  I'd rather stare at a drop-down oxygen mask on a plane than fucking Kenny.  Kenny had to take a flight by himself.  Were you scared, Kenny?  The windshield cracked on the plane.  What?  Yeah.  What is that about?  Bird strike?  That's not supposed to happen.  No, no.  We were just boarding.  Oh.  And it cracked as it's sitting there?  Yeah.  So I go to Newark Airport all by myself because I had to meet Jimmy in Cincinnati. 
[02:29:30]  Did you have a little name tag?  Yeah.  So you didn't get lost?  Hello, my name is...  Dolt.  Dolt.  So the plane was a half hour late boarding because of mechanical problems.  So I was like, all right, I hope they fix it, you know.  Do they have to tell us it's mechanical problems, by the way?  I know.  Just say it's weather somewhere.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So then we get on and I'm like in the third row so I can see the cockpit from my seat. 
[02:30:00]  Or the flight deck, Mr. 1950.  Exactly.  All right.  Anyway.  No, it's cockpit.  All righty.  Go ahead.  So all of a sudden, we get on and we're ready to close the door and the lady goes, ah, we've got to get off now.  So we're there already?  No.  And I look and the whole thing...  Did you think it was magic?  It was like fast airline.  We didn't even back out.  So now I figured we're screwed.  You're going to cancel the flight.  You got to scramble to get on another flight. 
[02:30:30]  You know, I can't leave poor Jimmy high and dry in Cincinnati.  No.  I was still in L.A. at that point.  I know.  I know.  What happened?  What happened?  I don't know.  Like Continental was good with that one.  Like 10 minutes later, they said you got to get on a shuttle bus to go to the other side of the terminal.  Oh, they gave you another plane?  To get on a plane.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good, because they usually don't just have planes available like that.  They do there, though, because it's a hub.  Yeah.  Ah!  By the way, the airline industry is so despicable. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  I flew Delta from L.A. to Cincy.  That's what I call it.  Because they didn't have any nonstop Continentals.  And then we flew Delta back to Newark.  We're distracted.  That's okay.  We're looking at Mia Jovovich.  Mia Jovovich pictures?  Oh, she's very nice.  From when?  Very naked.  She's got a big bush.  Yes, she does.  When are these from?  They're new pictures.  Are they new?  No.  All right, show a good full naked one.  Let's see.  Full nudity.  Full frontal nudity. 
[02:31:30]  Show me that one.  That one looks good.  Yeah, so we had to pay for our love nudity.  Shut up.  Kenny.  Fucking Kenny rules.  Oh, look.  It's nice.  She's got nice.  Yeah, I like that.  She just got married.  Not bad.  What the fuck?  She's got a little bush going there, too.  My bag cost a little comeback.  $110.  $110?  It was overweight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  68 pounds.  Instead of 50, $110 fucking dollars. 
[02:32:00]  Nice shitter.  Jimmy did some shopping in LA.  Yeah, huh?  Bought shoes and jeans and stuff.  And then, so your suitcase.  Now, your suitcase costs no matter what anyway, right?  Just the checker bag now costs money, right?  It's disgusting.  It shouldn't.  Normally, Jimmy's a first class flyer.  We know that, of course.  And, you know, we're elite members on Continental because that's where we usually fly, so the  bags are free.  Sure.  But now, you know, the people that fly last class got to pay for their bags. 
[02:32:30]  No matter what?  Every person?  Oh, yeah.  First bag you pay for unless you're elite.  People that can't afford it.  It's amazing how they just have to fuck you.  Yep.  It's an extra charge.  I guess they assume people are going to travel without luggage.  Yeah.  I'm going to be an extra charge.  I'm going to travel like Omar for free.  Get the Omar seat.  It's a noose.  But it shouldn't be an extra charge.  You need your luggage if you're flying.  I am Mr. Carry-On now. 
[02:33:00]  That's what I call myself.  Mr. Carry-On.  Oh, really?  Yes.  I like that name for you.  Yes.  It's Mr. Carry-On.  I got a new suitcase that is the absolute maximum size a carry-on bag could be.  And it's got the rollers and everything like that.  But inside, it's got all that shit where you could unfold and put the shirts in and everything,  pants, and everything I need.  I could go a week just out of that suitcase with no problem.  Why is this suitcase so special, he asks?  It's magical.  Can you tell me?  Because it's just laid out very well. 
[02:33:30]  It's big, but it's the exact size that a carry-on is.  What kind of suitcase?  It is a 5-Eleven suitcase.  Is it?  From 5-Eleven Tactical.  Of course it is.  Yeah.  And it's good.  It's got webbing on the outside.  You can put grenades on it if you need to.  5-Eleven?  What's the style of suitcase?  It is their rolling carry-on bag.  Jimmy's writing it down.  Look in their luggage section on 5-Eleven.com.  Where else would I be looking?  Yes, exactly.  We're missing the...  I don't know.  Knives?  Tactical wear? 
[02:34:00]  One in each hand.  Where's the pilot?  We're missing the conclusion to the Club Soda Kenny flying story.  Oh, right.  Oh.  Kenny?  Oh, no.  So, like, I took the bus all by myself.  I got all by myself.  Flew to Cincinnati.  Accessories.  Yeah, go to Accessories.  And then I got there, and I had a nice steak dinner at Morton's all by myself.  Oh.  Yeah.  But you're always all by yourself, even when you're with us. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Over.  Which one?  That?  Over.  That one.  I'm sure 5-Eleven Tactical Gear Luggage doesn't raise any eyebrows in TSA, either.  No, that's great.  Yeah, really.  All the mercenaries are using it.  No kidding, Jimmy.  Yeah.  That is a great fucking bag.  You can't roll through security with that.  Bulletproof.  Oh, I do.  It's great.  It's fantastic.  The only bad thing is, and I've done this a couple of times, I've used some bags for traveling  that I've used for the range, and you've got to watch, because sometimes some fucking 
[02:35:00]  casings fly off and land right in your bag.  Yeah.  So you've got to get your brass out of that fucking bag before you go through a...  Hold on.  ...land right in the clink.  Yes.  Not to interrupt the problem that no one else in this room but you will ever have.  But how much is this bag, and how can I get one quickly?  That is $139.99.  We could do it right now for you.  No, but they won't be on the limit by tie fly tomorrow.  Oh, tomorrow?  Yeah, that's trouble.  That's trouble.  You could, but I might as well buy one. 
[02:35:30]  I'm in Long Island.  I know.  How are you getting out there?  Aren't these 5'11 people shoot over here right now with bag in hand?  They should.  I got a good buddy over there.  I'll pay for it.  But, you know, I think he's not in New York.  No.  Which is the problem.  All right.  What do you travel?  Send Kenny to fetch it.  Damn it.  Kenny will go fetch it for you.  I wish.  Maybe South Shore Sporting.  All right.  Check after the show.  Are we getting that audio?  A couple of phone calls.  Or are we going to have to play...  That's a good super...  Punch him in the dick.  Punch him in the dick. 
[02:36:00]  Are we going to get the audio of Van Jones?  Motherfucking Van Jones!  Van Jones!  Van Jones!  Van Jones!  Van Jones!  Van Jones!  Van Jones!  What is that? 
[02:36:30]  Should we bring Graham in here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you want to take this?  You want to take this?  Let's go tag team.  Um, did you present this to the radio show, Graham? 
[02:37:00]  I did.  We're very early this morning.  Did you get a sunburn in the last ten seconds?  Yeah.  I think I was leaning on my face like this.  Look at his elbows, too.  Yeah.  What's the matter?  You're all red.  I'm sorry.  Whatever touches something.  I apologize again for the second time today.  You were leaning on your face.  So in other words, no matter what you were supposed to be doing, you had your elbow up on a table,  and your cheek and your hand just kind of sitting there.  I find that I'm more productive that way.  I am?  Yeah.  I like to get comfortable. 
[02:37:30]  Is it hard to talk with a mouth that's too small for your face?  His mouth is too small.  He has a small mouth.  Yeah, it was a little tiny.  I haven't heard that one before.  You've got to part it.  What have you heard?  That means he's heard a few.  I've heard Big Junos.  I've heard Big Forehead.  Jesus, I was just trying to be lighthearted.  Who's yelling Big Junos out the car window?  Barry Hitler, his friend.  Mostly my parents.  Your parents?  Yeah.  Your parents.  That's funny.  All right.  Heinrich and Eva, they adopted him.  They had no idea. 
[02:38:00]  So why did you bring this to the show?  Yeah.  Good question.  Oh, well, my roommate yesterday was basically playing it 24-7 nonstop.  That's all day long, by the way.  Yes, that's all day.  For the kids.  Yeah.  And it just got so stuck in my head, and we would just laugh at it all day.  I find punching in the dick very, very funny.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  All right, Jim.  I'm going to cover my dick just in case, though. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, you don't have to worry about that.  Okay.  But where did it come from?  I found it on YouTube.  It's a band.  I wrote it down on the thing.  And now the thought process.  You hear this, and you go, you know something?  Listen, I'm familiar enough now with the Opie and Anthony show.  Know what they do.  Know what kind of they find funny.  You know what the listeners find funny.  And this fits that criteria.  What made you think that?  Well, I think we all enjoy a good dick joke. 
[02:39:00]  So I feel like that's pretty universal among guys.  Is that really a dick joke?  It's kind of a...  Well, they make a lot of dick puns.  Later in the song, they talk about...  Oh, it gets better.  Oh, yeah.  They talk about...  We'll never get this.  Yeah, I'll have something.  They talk about...  Well, that's okay.  But later on in the song, they talk about punching Jesus in the dick.  Whoa, that's crazy.  And they also talk about punching George in his bush.  No, they did. 
[02:39:30]  And Powell in his colon.  What?  Powell in his colon.  Okay.  Yeah.  I found it to be hysterical.  We're cakes for nothing.  Let's see if it gets better.  Go and he'll buckle.  If you're in trouble, give him some urine trouble.  Hand him his brawls and tell him better.  Let him juggle.  Turn his pebbles into rough.  Make him wonder what might have been.  Blake, it's not a scout.  He'll never rise again. 
[02:40:00]  Now, every man claims to be the toughest in the venus.  But watch the clocks.  Because soon the losers will be the wieners.  And the winners in all the gladiator arenas.  They're always the ones that go straight for the penis.  So punch him in the dick.  What?  Punch him in the dick.  What?  Motherfucker talk shit.  I'ma punch him in the dick.  Blah!  Punch him in the dick.  Punch him in the dick.  Motherfucker talk shit.  I'ma punch him in the dick.  Gladiators.  Straight for the penis.  You'll be perfect.  As you and your friend are laughing about this,  if the gas oven was on. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  And you had no idea that the room was filling with fucking gas.  And one of you lit a cigar to celebrate the big laugh you found.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Footer wants to comment.  We got Footer.  Oh, Footer.  Yes, Footer.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Yeah, I'm working on a new song right now.  It's called Punch the Intern in the Face.  I like that one.  You don't like Punch Him in the Dick?  No, no, not very good.  And real quick, guys, Jimmy, I'm so glad you're back.  And I want a finger side piece, Jess.  I'm punching that voice later.  Oh, wow.  Wow, that wasn't nice. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  We got three minutes left in the song.  Are you kidding?  What could he possibly go from here?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He punched him in the dick.  That's BHG.  Dick, big heap of garbage.  We've been walking around with a BHG shirt on. 
[02:41:30]  Just this BHG on the front.  And me and Jimmy have just been toiling over what it could stand for for hours now.  Big hunk of garbage.  Yo, hunk is better.  Hunk is better.  Yeah, he really can't hang.  But you ain't gotta be a dude.  Should I dick punch a chick? 
[02:42:00]  Cause I don't discriminate when I punch him in the dick.  Whether Suzy Holmaker or a Foozy Holwrecker.  I'm a Decker in the pecker, motherfucker.  It could be your mama.  Better be no truth.  Almost two minutes left.  This is...  Almost two minutes left in the song.  This doesn't...  Are you kind of feeling maybe that this doesn't quite fit the show?  Like, obviously, it's a dick joke.  Yeah, were you high at the time there, Grim?  Yeah, what was going on?  No.  Did you tell your buddy?  Did you go, hey, I'm taking this to the show? 
[02:42:30]  I said, hey, guys, I'm gonna be a big shot today.  I'm gonna get it on the show, even though it's not my song.  Gonna take a chance.  Yeah.  Do you know the person whose song this is?  No.  I just found it on YouTube randomly.  It's Juicy Carcass.  Juicy Carcass.  Yeah.  Mmm.  Drama, you can beat a daddy.  Lama, I'm a step.  Put it on here with a right, left, right, left.  Yo, dick punch.  Then you say, goddamn, my shit's cursed.  Scroed him.  Hella damn near killed him.  I don't care if you're living bolder, man. 
[02:43:00]  Forget about children.  You ain't got enough kung fu to bust some ninja shit.  Fuck Sun Tzu.  You wanna learn the hard work?  Punch him in the dick.  What?  Punch him in the dick.  What?  Fuckers talk shit.  Straight punch him in the dick.  Blah.  Punch him in the dick.  Blah.  Punch him in the dick.  Motherfuckers talk shit.  Straight punch him in the dick.  Yeah.  Punch him in the dick.  What?  Punch him in the dick.  What?  Fuckers talk shit.  Straight punch him in the dick.  Punch him in the dick.  One minute and 30 seconds to go in the song.  You ever see those things on the web? 
[02:43:30]  All the kids are looking at it these days.  It says epic fail.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that what this is?  Yeah.  I'm seeing epic fail.  It's not good.  I have one.  I have one.  Oh, oh, okay.  Punch him in the dick.  You motherfuckers talk shit.  Punch him in the dick.  We got a brand new dance called Punches Ass.  Facepalm.  Facepalm.  Picard facepalm, yes.  Picard facepalm. 
[02:44:00]  That's, yeah, it's sad that I know that.  So put your head in your hand.  Yes.  Why not the double facepalm?  There's a double facepalm.  I know.  Okay.  Epic fail on cue.  The door should have opened.  Why are you looking at my photo?  Spanky wants in.  Punch him in the dick.  Punch him in the dick.  Spanky wants in, by the way.  BHG.  Big hippopotamus gut.  What? 
[02:44:30]  We got a brand new dance called Punches Ass.  Urg the dick.  Any of you snotty kids be talking shit.  I'm going to drop a fist on your naughty bitch.  I got punches of pitiful.  You bet you'll be a red little sting when I start swinging on your genitals.  Because then it'll swell up all out of proportion.  Looking like an eggplant forced into your forehead.  Foreskin, never mind abortion.  Forget my sex, don't me.  I've got your birth control file. 
[02:45:00]  Nutshell.  Good news, Ant.  One minute to go in the song.  Holy mother of...  Graham's having a ball over here.  He really is.  He's just enjoying the hell out of it.  Like an eggplant in your foreskin.  That's funny.  Is that one of your favorite lines from the song?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You think this guy has ever punched anyone in the dick, by the way?  No.  Yeah, I don't think so.  With his face.  That's funny, too.  Oh.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I punch God in the dick.  I punch Mary in the dick. 
[02:45:30]  I punch Jesus Christ in the dick.  No, I punch Cheney in the dick.  I punch Powell in his colon.  I punch George in his bush.  I punch Condoleezo.  He's going to punch George in his bush.  Yeah, I told you.  These white guys rapping?  Yeah.  You know how I do that?  Black guys don't rap about stuff like punching Jesus in the dick.  No?  No.  No, that's a good point.  They don't fuck it, really.  That's not a good point.  Oh.  But...  They don't mess with stuff like that.  Why is that?  They just don't.  Black people don't fuck with stuff like that.  You're being very racist saying that. 
[02:46:00]  No, it's true.  Oh, okay.  Good news, Ant.  45 seconds left in the song.  That was only...  I don't want to.  Do not want.  I don't want to punch him in the dick. 
[02:46:30]  Paul writes, big Hellman's gut.  Dick, watch me punch him in the dick.  Love to punch him in the dick.  Born to punch him in the dick.  Forever punch him in the dick.  Suck a punch him in the dick.  You punch him in the dick.  Hawaiian punch him in the motherfucker.  Dick.  All right. 
[02:47:00]  So, we made it.  Did we?  Maybe not completely intact.  Yeah.  And you want to file this?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is one of those songs we can play from time to time.  Because...  Easy.  There you go.  It's a good one.  Punch him in the dick.  Yeah.  It's written, you know, apostrophe E-M.  You know we have that hot pile?  Put that right on the top of the hot pile.  By Juicy Cargis. 
[02:47:30]  Submitted by new intern Graham.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And it's just a quick four minute and seven second ditty that we could throw on at any  time.  Yeah, let me put this in my bag.  All right.  All my good stuff.  Oops.  Oh, no.  You answer my question or you'll be standing tall before the man.  Oh, look at that.  It triggered a...  Yes, it broke.  It triggered an alert.  You had an oopsie.  You drop it.  Oh, did you just hit yourself the head?  No.  You dropped it.  Yeah.  Do you want me to make you another one?  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  Burn another one.  Literally.  Burn it.  Breast hit ground.  Oh, shit.  Let's say hi to Kurt.  Kurt.  BHG.  Boot homogram.  Oh, someone knows my name.  That's awesome.  It's all accounts, right?  I'm getting famous, you guys.  Punch it out.  I'm getting famous, you guys.  All right.  I'm getting famous, you guys.  That's kind of funny.  He could be a smartass. 
[02:48:30]  I don't know yet.  Trying to figure this out.  I'm getting famous, guys.  Well, we look forward to the next thing you bring to the show.  All right.  That's for sure.  True.  I'll be on the lookout.  Yeah, yeah.  Anything like that.  Something like punch him in the butt.  All right.  See, now you just...  Just wrecked it.  Good luck with those collagen injections.  Jesus, little lips.  He's fucking...  Oh, yeah.  He's saying his mouth's a little too small.  Fucking...  He's got the thinnest little teeny lips I ever saw.  Tiny.  Kind of like a cartoon mouth.  Yeah.  You know how they barely open it. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Inspector Gadget mouth.  Yeah.  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.  All right, Graham.  That was terrific.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There goes Graham, our new intern.  Go get the hell out of here.  See what Kenny's doing on the computer.  He's playing Pong.  He keeps spelling with a P-H.  I thought it was Asian.  What is he doing?  He's always out there with some kind of...  It doesn't look interesting at all.  I have a spreadsheet.  He's scrolling and it really looks like a spreadsheet. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  There's nothing...  Nothing fun, exciting.  Nothing catches your eye on his computer screen.  Just a big bore on that screen.  If you walked up to Kenny and you looked at him and he realized he was counting dust money,  and you said, what are you doing?  He'd go, having fun.  One consolation, the screen is just as bored looking back at him.  It's just the same thing.  Neither one of them will blink.  I'm on CompuServe.  Brian in Virginia.  Yes.  Belly has grown. 
[02:50:00]  Very good.  How about buy him gum?  Oh, shit.  Jesus, Jimmy.  He took care of that one, didn't he?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm sure he has.  Kissing the guy.  Yeah.  I'm just teasing him.  All right.  Well, we're going to get into his Van Jones thing after the break.  Yeah.  Motherfucking Van Jones.  Motherfucking Van Jones.  See what that's all about. 
[02:50:30]  Commie.  He's, uh...  Oh, he wasn't doing any favors for Obama, especially on the eve of his big speech.  Yeah, this is a big day in history, by the way.  You know that awesome comic strip, Blondie?  Ugh.  Yes.  Oh, it's so funny with Dagwood.  It was published for the first time 79 years ago.  That's fucking 80 years old?  And still going?  Why'd they stop it?  Does that just annoy you?  What is there left to say? 
[02:51:00]  Hey, Mr. Bumstead.  Jimmy, why don't you read the comics?  Oh, look, he's eating the big sandwich again.  Oh, wow.  That Dagwood.  I don't know why Jimmy doesn't read the comics anymore.  Because the laughing part hurt my throat.  I'll just...  I won't laugh through it, because it really does hurt my throat.  All right.  Let's see if there's a Blondie, at least.  Oh, it's fucking awful.  Let's see if there's a Blondie.  It should be Blindie, by David Patterson.  Oof.  Belly hides groin.  That's funny.  Jeff in Houston. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, yes.  There's Marmaduke.  Like, um, like, um, I just, like, um, I was, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, I was, like, um, I was, like, um, I was, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, like, um, it's so, like, um.  If you're just tuning in, no edits in that audio.  Here's, um.  Can't even believe that.  Yeah.  Three, three, uh, three-piece Blondie. 
[02:52:00]  So, 79 years ago today, they must have a really good, good strip today.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's, uh, Dagwood is sitting at a counter in a diner, and the old cook is pouring him some coffee, and he says to Dagwood, how's business at J.C. Dithers and Company?  Mm-hmm.  To which Dagwood responds, not good, we're down 8%.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  To which the man says, what about layoffs?  And Dagwood says, anyone who isn't giving his all, going the extra mile and bearing down every second is in trouble. 
[02:52:30]  And then the next thing Dagwood said, at least that's the chatter in the employee lounge.  That's it?  Yeah.  Is that a two-parter?  No, is that really it?  That's the whole thing.  It's mind-boggling how awfully the only strip they are.  Who the fuck would laugh at that?  Who's chuckling at that?  Like, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, gosh.  Well, I mean, 79 years ago, this was before basically phones.  So, you know.  Before anything, yeah.  Before anything. 
[02:53:00]  Before movies.  Before whatever.  Yeah, I guess that's the only answer.  You've got a whole cereal going.  So it's old people, is what you're saying, are laughing at that.  No one's laughing at that.  They stink.  Is that a cliffhanger?  They're fucking...  I hate Dilbert.  You don't think old people go like, oh, ho, ho, ho.  Why don't you like Dilbert?  Because everyone is shaped like something that belongs shoved in an asshole in the cartoon.  They're all shaped like butt plugs and toes.  Fucking Dilbert.  I loathe Dilbert. 
[02:53:30]  Just shaped like sex toys.  These are...  Here's one.  The first cartoon is called Rose is Rose.  Rose is Rose.  I've never heard of it.  Okay.  Ro!  It's got like a little person and a cat at the door.  And there's like the noise, squeak, squeak, click.  And then it says, Russell.  And then the person goes, will you be much longer, mama?  And from inside the door, yes.  Squeak, squeak, click, Russell.  I guess that's the noise behind the bathroom door.  And then a new...  It says this.  A new multi-pack of highlighter pens. 
[02:54:00]  In scented neon colors.  Takes a while to break in.  What?  What does that mean?  I guess the person on the side of the door was breaking in their pens going, squeak, squeak,  squeak.  But like what...  This is in the newspaper.  Oh my god.  These are fucking terrible.  They're terrible.  It's not on like some unknown Facebook page.  This is like...  This is for the masses.  Oh, and here's one.  Yeah.  This is supposed to appeal to these fucking douchebags that enjoy Doonesbury. 
[02:54:30]  Do you like Doonesbury, Jimmy?  No one likes Doonesbury.  It's fucking dry and awful.  All right.  It's called Zitz.  Zitz.  And the guy has hands like a Doonesbury character.  And it's a woman and a guy sitting at a table.  And she says, how was your day, Jeremy?  And he says, okay.  And she says, tell me about school.  Every detail.  And he says, well, it's a big building.  And she says, okay.  Every other detail.  I guess that was a mom trying to ask her son. 
[02:55:00]  Fucking A.  What?  What?  The waste of paper.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  These are fucking...  A lot of fails.  These are god awful bad.  They're so good.  What was the one you really liked?  Do you know there's a...  What was his favorite that he used to do?  Marmaduke.  Marmaduke.  No, he...  Beetle Bailey, right?  There was the Lockhorns, too.  Lockhorns and Beetle Bailey, Jimmy.  The Lockhorns I don't hate as much. 
[02:55:30]  But this is what I've never seen before.  Sherman's Lagoon.  Sherman's Lagoon.  Do you realize that somebody said to someone, what do you do for a living?  Oh, I draw Sherman's Lagoon.  And he expected them to go, really?  I read that.  And they went, what is Sherman's Lagoon?  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  Is that a painting?  No.  You got to bring this bit to Jay Leto.  I'm telling you.  Jay would have a lot of fun with the comics.  These are terrible.  Sherman's Lagoon.  I'll read it.  Yeah, please.  It's a guy, I think it's a guy and his son camping, looking at a waterfall. 
[02:56:00]  And the father says, wow.  Is it Yellowstone?  Spectacular.  Look at that waterfall.  Yes.  And then two other people, a guy and his wife come over with a camera, and they say, excuse  us, would you mind taking our picture in front of the falls?  And the father who was talking, he went, uh, sure.  So now it's just the father in frame holding the camera.  And he goes, okay, still not up in the frame.  Back it up a little bit more, a bit more.  And in the last frame, you hear, ah! 
[02:56:30]  And now the father and son are talking.  Um, so what's the etiquette here?  Do I get their camera?  Hold on.  They hit water.  I guess they fell off a cliff is what happened.  Right.  In, uh, Sherman's Lagoon.  You hear how they had to keep it safe at the end?  They hit water.  Yeah, they hit water.  Probably not dead.  Probably not dead.  So you don't get to keep the camera.  Oof.  Uh, well.  That laugh was brought to you by Sherman's Lagoon.  Jeremy, people are trying to defend the comic strip. 
[02:57:00]  Let one person defend it.  Spanky writes, this is good.  Dagwood started in the Great Depression.  What do you expect?  When you're eating sawdust, you'll laugh at anything.  I don't mind the existence of them at one point.  But how about since that?  How about since all colors were allowed to vote, we didn't need fucking comic strips?  I'd rather take the comic strips.  Let's go to James in Virginia.  79 years of Blondie.  Yes, James.  Yeah, I've got the anniversary cartoon for the 79 years. 
[02:57:30]  Blondie's laying on the kitchen floor with a knife sticking out of her back.  And Dagwood's sitting, drinking a cup of coffee and says,  Happy 79th, babe.  Kind of like it.  I like it, too.  I would have went more with like an About Schmidt with the vacuum cleaner going with Blondie.  Blondie kind of on her back with a shoe askew.  How about this one?  Dagwood comes home with his lunchbox early.  And Blondie's on the floor with her legs open. 
[02:58:00]  And there's peanut butter on the table.  And Marmaduke is there.  Oh, I like how you combine two colors.  There's two oven mitts.  Looking silly with the oven mitts taped to his front paws.  And he's deep-dicking her while Mr. Lockhorn films it.  And then, you know who's taking the pictures?  The dad from Sherman.  Sherman.  I thought it was about food.  Sherman's legume.  Legume. 
[02:58:30]  I thought it was about the Jeffersons.  Sherman's.  Oh, my.  Let me see.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I know.  I understand.  Let's go to Victor in Maryland.  Victor.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I just thought you would enjoy knowing, especially for Jimmy, a little trivia here,  that the guy who writes Sherman's Lagoon works at the Home Depot in Annapolis, Maryland.  That's great.  Exactly what he should do. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, keep your day job, right?  Yeah, what do you do?  Hey, could you mix up that fucking semi-gloss latex?  I can't.  I'm drawing Sherman's Lagoon.  Yeah, maybe you could do those little illustrations they have on their aprons or something.  I don't know.  I hope he draws Sherman's Lagoon while he's on a 15-minute break and he's shitting in the  stock room.  I hope he sketches Sherman on his hairy fucking legs as he's shitting.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Dave from Tennessee has another why this comic should just stop. 
[02:59:30]  Blondie should stop.  Yes, Dave.  Hey, guys.  How about if the people that created half of these died 30 years ago?  You might want to give it a rat.  Yeah.  Yeah, the guy that wrote the Lockhorns died like fucking in the 80s or something.  Did he?  Oh, yeah.  I think so.  And then the sun takes over.  The fucking, you know what?  The Far Side was a really funny cartoon.  And unfortunately, Gary Larson retired.  He knew when to quit.  But that was a great one.  The Far Side was hilarious.  Yeah, people seem to like those in the calendars and everything.  Why did he retire? 
[03:00:00]  He probably just realized it was done.  So what am I going to do?  70 fucking nine years?  Yeah, I guess.  Keep drawing a cow fucking saying something weird?  But even the Post has it, too.  It's like, what are you fucking doing?  Yeah, what year is this?  No, under the papers are just folding.  Oh, here's one.  Not literally.  Mallard Fillmore.  But I thought Millard Fillmore.  You know what?  When the comics title is a take off on a president that no one fucking remembers. 
[03:00:30]  Is that what that's based on?  Yeah, probably.  Was it Millard Fillmore?  Was that his name?  I think so.  So it's Mallard Fillmore.  That's ridiculous.  Here's Dennis the Menace.  It's a one-frame cartoon.  Dennis is sitting there sipping a drink, talking to his mother in the kitchen.  And here's the quote.  Mr. Wilson told me to have a good day, but he didn't look like he meant it.  There's not one person in New York that reads that, and it means anything to him.  Are you kidding?  That's it?  That doesn't resonate with anybody. 
[03:01:00]  No.  Why is it still in the paper, then?  I don't know.  A photo of my eye drops would do as much for people comedically.  That's just god-awful.  It's hard to be funny in this politically correct, shitty day and age.  Yeah.  But, I mean, come on.  But that's not even close.  Mr. Wilson said that.  Any humor.  Thank you.  What about Beetle Bailey?  I don't see Beetle Bailey.  What happened to Beetle Bailey?  I don't know.  Did he finally get a fucking improvised explosive device? 
[03:01:30]  Exactly.  What about him and his stupid sergeant up?  Blue sergeant's gut off.  Sarge has a hole in his stomach.  What about Brenda Starr?  Is she still looking hot in the paper?  Here's the one the Post has.  They have Garfield, which everyone looks like Susan Sarandon.  And then Wizard rhymes with orange, Mollard Fillmore, Heart of the City, Non-Sequitur, and Dennis the Menace. 
[03:02:00]  How much of a menace is he really?  He's not.  He's sitting there sipping his drink.  This would be a great quote.  If Dennis the Menace, if he said, Mr. Wilson told me to have a good day, but he didn't look like he meant it, and there was a hammer in Dennis' head.  I would howl at that.  That would be good.  Yeah, and then you see in the background, through the window, Mr. Wilson with a fucking looking crotchy with a beer in his hand. 
[03:02:30]  See?  How easy would that be to draw?  Just a hammer in his head.  Yeah.  The claw end of a hammer.  Lazy ass.  In his menacy head.  And you realize Dennis had been menacing, and perhaps traipsed you through Mr. Wilson's garden.  Yes.  And Mr. Wilson came out, and removed a hammer from his toolbox, and tried to slay the boy with it.  Got his comeuppance, exactly.  What better way to get a boy out of your garden than by burying the claw end of a hammer deep in his head? 
[03:03:00]  Suggestion.  Susan Smith drives her van loaded with kids into Sherman's Lagoon.  Are we going to get into this Van Jones or what?  I want to hear the Van Jones, motherfucker.  Quick break, and we'll get into Van Jones.  Aw, yeah.  Primus, huh? 
[03:03:30]  Hey, Van Jones.  Van Jones.  So we've got to kind of explain this again.  One of Obama's guys is out.  Yeah, he's one of these czars.  Obama likes appointing czars because they don't have to really answer to anybody.  They're not representative of anybody.  They're not elected officials.  It's just Obama anointing people to come into his inner circle and share their ideas on things and get out there. 
[03:04:00]  And he just – he's horrible at choosing these people.  What's going on with Obama?  He looks very angry lately.  Well, he's not getting his way.  He's not that happy-go-lucky guy.  He's not getting his way.  He's not getting his way.  During the election.  And it's not only the Republicans.  A lot of Democrats are like, dude, you're fucking up the midterm elections.  Right.  He is completely fucking up the midterm elections for the Democrats.  And some of his choices are being really questioned.  Oh, they're hard.  And he has to – I love the fact that political correctness bit him the way it's bitten everybody else. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Good.  It doesn't matter.  Now, you know, you're in charge.  It's your responsibility to show that you have sense enough to pick qualified people for certain jobs,  not some ex-militant fucking communist for the Greens job.  And Drudge broke this because Drudge pointed out, fuck it, there was not one – at least I didn't see any mainstream coverage of this guy's remarks at all.  Yep.  None.  Yeah.  Drudge and – what's his name? 
[03:05:00]  Beck.  Of course, Glenn Beck.  Because this guy's organization is the one that was targeting Glenn Beck for saying Obama was a racist.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't even – not only can you not say racial remarks, you can't accuse Obama of being something.  You can't criticize his policies without people saying the only reason you're criticizing them is because he's a black man.  And, you know, people can't take a black man being in the White House.  It's like, no, look.  He's in there and he's showing that some of his choices are – well, we got some audio of Van Jones. 
[03:05:30]  Van Jones.  Only suburban white kids are shooting up schools.  Oh, there you go.  Our young white males are suffering in this society profoundly, profoundly, and nobody is saying a word about it.  We'll criminalize the black student, criminalize the black child, the Latino child.  We'll have this whole discussion about, well, are they animals?  Are they not animals?  Should we abuse them? 
[03:06:00]  Should we help them?  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  And that young white boy is sitting there suffering.  You've never seen a Columbine done by a black child.  Never.  They always say, we can't believe it happened here.  We can't believe it was these suburban white kids.  It's only them.  Now, a black kid might shoot another black kid.  He ain't going to shoot up the whole school.  My cousin's up in here.  I ain't going to shoot up the whole school.  I'm going to hit my cousin. 
[03:06:30]  I'm going to shoot you, though.  But these young white men will be in so much pain and so isolated and so illy, they'll shoot up the entire school.  Not the entire school.  Shut up.  Actually, what he's saying there is pretty correct.  It's accurate that most of the school shootings are done by white, you know, spoiled, rotten white kids.  Yeah, he's right about that.  But you know something?  Don't try to make it sound like black kids don't shoot up schools or each other.  Yeah, he makes it sound like, oh, it's just, you know, one guy, one-on-one. 
[03:07:00]  I think if you look at the stats, a lot more people have been shot by black youth in various situations than by white kids in school.  Well, the subtlety of what he was saying, this is what annoyed me about this guy.  It really is a veiled attack on white men because, is there more audio up?  Is there any more of that?  Yeah, he goes after Bush a little bit.  That was a different speech.  If this is the one I'm thinking of.  No, this is all we got on that one, unfortunately, yeah.  Because on this one, afterwards, he goes something about how these, because he's saying these white kids are in pain. 
[03:07:30]  So it's hard to argue with a guy who is saying, hey, these kids are in pain.  But then he goes into saying something like how they don't have certain role models and masculine role model.  It's like, it's a real veiled attack on white men.  It's like, I wish you had the rest of it.  But what he said up to that point was correct.  Well, yeah, it's true.  There has not been a black Columbine or whatever.  They don't, they don't, white kids that aren't shooting up schools.  It's fine to say that. 
[03:08:00]  But, but he's not, on the other hand, turning it around, being accurate about what black youth are doing.  They are, are being more destructive, uh, to each other and to, um, who they would be going to school with, uh, than any white kid going into Columbine and shooting up, you know, uh, uh, uh, students in their school.  Every fucking day, there's black kids on the street dead from gang activity, fucking robberies, uh, uh, uh, just blatant bullshit, disrespect. 
[03:08:30]  Ugh.  I say someone stepped on your foot and you had to shoot them.  Oh, I understand.  And, and, and you go through, uh, a one month's time, one year's time, go through a year.  Let's look at how many white kids have shot up, uh, a school in one of the worst, take one of the worst fucking years that white kids shot up schools.  You know, we had Columbine in and whatever happened in that year, if there were any other ones.  And let's put it against, you know, just black on black, black on white, whatever, whatever, black youths with guns shooting people crime. 
[03:09:00]  I think you're going to find that's more of an epidemic than white kids, you know, yeah, it is a white fucking thing.  Is he trying to make it feel you a middle age to older white guy problem?  Well, he's trying to make it sound like it's an epidemic with the white kids shooting up schools.  And it really isn't.  No.  Well, he was actually just his, well, he said that we have them and that, you know, but they're not happening frequently.  Thank God.  What he said that I agreed with was when he goes, uh, they always say we can't believe it happens here. 
[03:09:30]  It's only happening there.  He's right.  But the rest, the thing, I know I sound like I'm defending him.  I do think the guy's a jerk off because afterwards, the reason he's saying this, as you can see where that little veiled attack is coming out.  We say that about every criminal.  When someone, you know, your neighbor, well, I didn't think he was the type.  You know, we're always surprised.  Yeah.  But he shouldn't have been fired for saying this.  He shouldn't have had to step down for having said this in his past.  Is this the reason why he got? 
[03:10:00]  This and the other one.  Well, they dug up some of this stuff in the past.  Dude, this is the fucking last straw.  He's been on a tear with his fucking communist bullshit.  His fucking signing of that paper for the 9-11, like, uh, uh, government involvement or at least government not, um, alerting, uh, the, the proper authorities like they were in on it.  He's a proponent of that bullshit.  Just get the, this guy shouldn't be, uh, uh, counseling the president.  Fuck him. 
[03:10:30]  Goodbye, communist fucking sympathizing asshole.  This is Obama's-  Anti-capitalistic fucking destroy America douchebag.  Good riddance.  Go fuck your mother.  This is Obama's inexperience as a politician, though.  Like, they said his inexperience will come in and haunt him once in a while.  Yeah.  This is where it is.  It's like, we're making these choices.  I think, I, I really do think Obama's heart's in the right place.  I don't think the guy's a piece of shit.  I just, I, I think that he's picking guys that are, are wrong for the job because I think he's just listening to, like, I think he's, I just think he's making really stupid decisions because he's inexperienced. 
[03:11:00]  I think Obama's a lot more calculated than everybody thinks he is.  I think he's a lot more, um, revolutionary than people think he is.  I think he wants to see this country undergo a massive socialist change under his regime.  And he's, uh, doing things and putting things in place to pull that off.  He's, he's fucking, he's doing things that are putting, uh, people in positions of power.  Um, government is more involved in our fucking everyday life than it ever before. 
[03:11:30]  Uh, chalking up huge deaths, keeping the economy, uh, kind of fucked up to keep people scared.  Um, it just, he's, he's got things in line to really change the country.  Not for the good.  For what he thinks is good, which is socialism.  Um, I think he's a lot more calculated than people are giving him credit.  And people are reminding us that the two snipers in D.C. were black.  And this guy.  Well, we're always going to get the, uh.  Yeah, I know.  And then you got Mark in Chicago about school shootings.  Uh, we forgot this one.  Mark, go ahead. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, those, uh, overachieving Asians, uh, totally have his beat and body counts.  No one really brought that up.  He probably made this speech before, uh, before that happened.  Virginia Tech.  And I'm not even saying that other, of course other groups do it.  Of course they're.  Yeah.  But I, I don't think a guy should be, my point is, I don't, I hate seeing people faulted  for things they've said in the past.  Like, that was a racial opinion he had.  He should be allowed to have it.  But I'm glad to see him go down just because he was one guy who'd probably want Glenn Beck  to go down for saying something he didn't like. 
[03:12:30]  So fuck him.  He got what he deserved.  Here's something else, uh, Van Jones said.  Oh, language.  Way to try to bring the price of energy down is simply to increase the supply.  Just begin to drill more.  To drill offshore.  To drill here.  To drill there.  To liquify coal.  To go with oil shale and tar sands.  Do whatever you can to get more petroleum into the system.  And we heard our president saying just that.  That's what he wants to do.  He means Bush, buddy.  And I hate to say this, and I hope I don't offend anybody, but the president of the United  States sounded like a crackhead when he said that. 
[03:13:00]  I just, a little bit more.  Just a little bit, just a little bit more, a little bit more, a little bit more, a little  bit more.  A little bit more, I can get some more, I can get some more.  It was shameful.  Am I wrong?  Did you see this?  Like a crackhead trying to lick the crack pipe for a fix.  The, the, the reality.  I'm sorry, I'm going to speak some ebonics up here.  Good luck with the translation.  I don't know.  You're not Chris Rock, you fucking cunt. 
[03:13:30]  God damn, stop trying to be a comedian every time you open your yap.  Oh, what the fuck this guy did?  Every speech I heard from him, and not just old speeches, new speeches.  He's talking about the fucking, uh, using his platform that he has, which is Green Jobs  Guy, which is such a fucking, should be a nothing job.  You want to work at a windmill plant?  Here.  Here's a job.  But, uh, the guy was always using it as a stepping stone or some kind of platform to 
[03:14:00]  push a socialist, if not communist agenda.  And don't call me paranoid.  I studied this motherfucker.  I, I, I've seen what this guy is, uh, uh, uh, was up to in his youth.  The guy, it was, it was a black militant.  Fucking black militant.  No one said you were paranoid.  Yeah.  Why would you come up with that?  No one said it?  I heard it in my head 20 times real loud.  Why would you come up with that?  That's how you know somebody is fucking nuts. 
[03:14:30]  No kidding.  In the middle of something.  And don't call me paranoid.  They're like, well, no one has said that.  No one was thinking that.  Really?  Oh, well, maybe it was me.  Let's go to James in Chicago.  The Windy City.  Hey there, James.  Check it in.  Hey guys.  Hello.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you, James.  White Sox or Cubs?  Uh, White Sox.  Gotta be White Sox now.  Always White Sox.  Our fans like the White Sox.  Gotta be White Sox now, yeah.  Who likes the Cubs?  No one.  No one?  All right.  My father-in-law does, but that's a different story. 
[03:15:00]  But he's an ass.  Oh, boy.  No, there is a big movement over here, Anthony.  Don't fret too much, because the Republicans in Illinois are actually getting their shit together finally.  It's been a while.  But they are getting their shit together over here, and you're going to see a big push.  We're going to have a Republican senator coming in here in the next election.  The Roland Burris is going to be out.  So, I think you're going to see this across the board, especially in middle America here.  I think this Democratic thing with crawling up everybody's fucking asshole in this country, 
[03:15:30]  and babysitting everybody, and spending, getting the deficit up, and taxing the shit out of us,  the honeymoon ended so quickly with this guy, and especially with the Senate and Congress.  They're just, people are fucking pissed.  They're pissed off.  And then when you go to these town hall meetings, and people voice their opinion,  they're called racist, and they're being questioned by the people that are speaking 
[03:16:00]  as to whether they even reside in the cities that they're holding these in.  It's ridiculous.  Do they do that to move on?  Do they do that to the Million Man March?  Do they do that, or the Sharptons March?  No, of course not.  And those are organized events.  These are actual individuals taking their time out to go to these things and voice their opinions,  because they're pissed.  And it's really going to be fun to watch the Democrats, who had all this momentum with Obama, 
[03:16:30]  just lose it all.  Because we need, I do think we need a little more of a check and balance, as they say, in place.  I don't like the fact that Obama's got a majority in there, and still can't get shit done, by the way.  Which just goes to tell you, or show you, this guy's ideas are a little too fucking left, even for the left.  It's unbelievable over here, and especially being a Republican from Chicago, that's a...  Oh, ooh.  Anyway.  Yeah, I bet.  Okay.  Have fun there.  I live out in Stifton County right now, so I have my guns, thank God. 
[03:17:00]  That's it.  We're going to be...  I think we're going to be okay.  By your guns.  All right, sir.  All right, sir.  We've got to move on to Sam in New Hampshire.  Sam.  Hi.  I was just going to point out to Ant that in one breath he says Van Jones is crazy for the 9-11 stuff,  which I agree with, but then you say in your next step that Obama's manipulating the economy to control people,  which would be a grander conspiracy than anything.  No, I never said he's manipulating the economy.  I said he's using the state of the economy, just like George Bush used terrorism during... 
[03:17:30]  It was eight fucking years just about that George Bush used the fear of terrorism to wield his power and get certain things passed.  Obama is using the economy to scare people into seeing it his way.  You know, I'm not buying it.  I think it's a guy that has a socialist agenda that people are seeing right through. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, all that's fine.  I was just pointing out how on one hand a conspiracy seemed crazy, but then on the other hand you were kind of creating a bigger conspiracy that somehow...  No, not conspiracy.  Everyone has said it.  It's still just politics.  It's business as usual politics.  But I'm saying, you know, the guy has an agenda, and he's using politics and his power and whatever he can to get it done,  but it ain't working like he thought it would.  He thought all the Democrats would be behind him.  This health care thing really blew up in his fucking face. 
[03:18:30]  These Democrats don't want to sit there and back this guy, and then when the elections come around,  they're getting shit on because they backed a losing horse.  Well, he only won because Bush was so bad.  Exactly.  That's true.  All right.  McCain ran a decent campaign.  I just think that he was too old.  Yeah.  Let's go to Arizona.  Mike?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Mike.  Hi, Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, Norton, you were talking about, you know, this guy that's just inexperienced. 
[03:19:00]  Well, if you actually look at what Obama's doing with these people he's appointing,  these are the people that he grew up around and went to school with and learned from.  And if you look at what he's doing, it's right out of a book called Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky.  You know, every move they keep making is exactly right out of that book.  But what's happening is—  If you read the book, you'll see exactly what they're doing.  Even if that's true, what's happening is it's biting him in the ass already.  So he doesn't have—like, his political inexperience, it's like there's ways to get around things or to do things, 
[03:19:30]  but he should not be having this much trouble getting people into positions this fast  or making this many questionable decisions this fast.  I think that's where his inexperience comes in.  Well, I think a lot of it is—I don't think—I think the way the media gushed all over him, mainly MSNBC,  you know, the way they gush all over him, I don't think he ever expected to be challenged on any of it.  Well, his inexperience just didn't—  I'm sorry.  We were going to fall lockstep behind him and, you know, just go along with what he said, 
[03:20:00]  because I think he thinks he's the messiah.  No, he doesn't.  I just think that his inexperience wasn't challenged because the media's in love with him.  He was challenged.  Constantly he was challenged that he didn't have enough experience to—  But I mean not just saying the words, but I mean, like, the media, like, really challenging this guy  and showing where he made bad decisions.  There just wasn't a track record to go after.  After you, he voted for this.  He voted for that.  But, you know, it was—like, you go after an incumbent president, you have a tremendous track record. 
[03:20:30]  There wasn't a huge track record on Obama.  So there was not—  Well, because he never voted for anything.  No, exactly.  He never voted.  But whatever reason, sir, I'm saying his inexperience is showing now in some of his decision-making.  Now they're saying it, right.  Okay, well, that I agree with.  That's what I'm saying.  His lack of fucking, like, being able to make a wise decision.  Yeah.  Like, him appointing all these czars.  And then the head of the bank is a guy who couldn't even fucking figure out his taxes. 
[03:21:00]  Taxes, yeah.  I mean, how do you do that?  Especially with banking crises going on.  And it's just—it's beyond me.  Let's go to Bill in Indiana.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi, Bill.  Hey, Hansi, I was wondering what you thought about that old $600 tax check we got in the mail.  Because back last—well, the May before last, Hillary Clinton was saying, hey, I'm going to give you $600 in taxes.  Then Bush cut her off and did it first.  When Hillary was doing it, everyone was screaming, oh, this is great, and Democrats are awesome. 
[03:21:30]  And then George Bush does it.  And they go, well, that was the dumbest move in the history of America.  Then Obama does it.  Yeah.  And everyone's going, oh, this is great again.  Yeah, this tax refund.  That's the typical fucking doesn't matter what the other side does, it's wrong.  Do you know I got a check from California for $180 they gave me back?  It's fucking postmarked to October.  It's post-dated.  Is that what it called?  Post-dated.  What do you call it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, post-dated.  I can't cash it because I don't have enough money. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, that's like an IOU.  So it's not good until it's an IOU.  Yeah, that's what they were handing out.  California was handing out like IOU.  Fucking IOU from California.  IOU, Jimmy.  That's so fucked up if you think about it.  I know.  That is unbelievable.  Let me say hi to Chris in California.  Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, was Anthony there?  Of course.  No, he went home, sir.  Hey, he went home.  How you doing there, little Jimmy?  Hey, buddy. 
[03:22:30]  Hey, well, you know, I got a little view here.  You know, Anthony and Opie there, they make all kinds of money.  So I figure, you know, why don't they go out a little bit more in taxes and help the rest of us pour slobs out, you know?  Yeah, that's a good idea.  That's a good idea.  That reminds me.  Yeah, I think I just got a check that I have to send out.  Did you get that one?  Yeah, wasn't that nice?  I don't.  I didn't get that one.  Why don't you send it to me?  No, no, no, no, no. 
[03:23:00]  You will get it.  See, you will get it because I have to pay it every three months.  See, everybody goes, oh, income tax time, income tax time.  That's every three months for us.  And it's an amount that's ridiculous.  And they go, oh, well, you got to make a lot more in order to pay more taxes.  Yeah.  But the ratio, the percentage is ludicrously, ridiculously different.  And that's what I don't agree with.  And by the way, I'm being penalized for achieving what we're supposed to achieve in this country. 
[03:23:30]  I actually understood that to a point there, sir.  But now it's just completely out of hand.  When more than half your money is going to the government, that's just insane.  And then the tax and everything else, like, you know, the money you get to keep is taxed up the ass.  And then did you see when Obama got passed, like, recently?  How did this happen?  You know, like, and believe me, I'm not a proponent of smoking.  But no more clove cigarettes.  They're, like, illegal.  No flavored cigarettes.  Because they appeal to children. 
[03:24:00]  And we have to protect the world.  And no such thing anymore as light cigarettes or anything that implies that one cigarette is less dangerous than another.  Billboards can't be put up near schools.  Cigarette billboards.  And the cost of all of this changes, all the changes being made, has to be put on the cigarette companies.  They have to pay for the cost of what, in essence, is going to be fucking over their business.  As much as I agree with you, the tobacco companies have been such dishonest scumbags. 
[03:24:30]  Like, they've lied in studies.  They've been so terrible that any fucking they get, I'm actually for it.  Well, then, you know what, there's products out there that get pulled off the shelves because a ton of it, eaten by a mouse in a week, killed the mouse.  Cigarettes are known killers.  Take them off the fucking market.  I don't disagree.  Then, instead of fucking putting these politically correct little things and, oh, the children and this, that, take them off the fucking market. 
[03:25:00]  They're known killers.  That's the lobby.  That's the lobby.  If there was a fucking food that was as poisonous as cigarettes are, first of all, no one would buy it.  You wouldn't even fucking buy it off the shelves.  Secondly, the FDA would pull that in a second.  There's too much money involved.  I'm telling you, there's too much money.  Yeah, of course there is.  And states are fucking, that's their whole, I'm sure a lot of states make so much money.  And they have very powerful lobbies.  Yeah, the southern states have been on tobacco for years.  They've run off tobacco.  But yeah, I'd love to see them just yank cigarettes. 
[03:25:30]  And I know I'm an ex-smoker being a prick, but I'm sick of them.  I got John in Denver here.  John.  John in Denver.  Sorry about that flight.  Go ahead, John.  John.  That's just like, um, like, um, like, um, cigarette, like, um, like, um.  We got it, John.  That's all.  Like, um, like, um, I just, like, um, I was, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, like, um.  I was, like, um.  It's the worst talker ever.  Like, um, like, um, like, um, like, um, like, um, like, um, like, um, like, um. 
[03:26:00]  It's so, like.  And once again, no edits.  Like, um, like, um, like, um.  Like, um.  That was one attempt at an answer to a question.  John in Albany.  Hey, John.  Hey, guys.  I'd just like to thank you, taxpayers, for the nice little Georgia Dream program I have down here in South Georgia  where I got paid $14,000 to buy my foreclosure house.  Got paid $14,000 to buy your foreclosure house. 
[03:26:30]  Yes, under the Georgia Dream program, you buy a foreclosure, you get $14,000 from the government.  All you have to do is live in the house for six years, and you don't have to pay it back.  $9,000 goes towards down payment.  $5,000 goes towards any repairs that need to be made to it.  All you have to do is make less than $35,000 a year, and it has to be your first house you bought in three years.  I think it's great that the people who want bigger—this is not what you're saying, sir—  but people who want you to pay more taxes to help them out, it's like, how come it doesn't go both ways?  I'll pay more taxes, but how about if you have a chick that's hotter than mine, I get to fuck her? 
[03:27:00]  Like, why can't—like, if I've got to share my money or Ann's got to share his money,  why don't you have to share the pussy or share whatever?  Your wife's got to cook for me, or you have to cook for me.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't you have to share anything?  What's the difference?  Yeah.  Take every asset you have, and you have to share that.  Why is it just financial?  Money.  Why is it this fucking money thing?  Every asset you have should be shared with people that don't have that.  Your bigger dick has landed you a much better girl. 
[03:27:30]  Share that with me.  We'll be over to banger, and it'll be great.  We'll leave a check.  And then, yeah, we'll leave some money.  It's all big—we all got to be on the same plane here.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Michelle in Illinois.  Michelle?  Hi.  Who is that like, um, guy?  It sounds like a Billy Crystal character.  Like, um, like, um, I just like, um, I was like, um, I—  He's the Louisiana fucking Negro horn player.  Like, um, like, um, heh heh. 
[03:28:00]  Let me tell you, let me tell you, when, uh, the hurricane came through—  Shut up.  I think it's worth playing again.  This guy is a Buffalo Bill.  Does Z-Rock have it?  I think he brought it down the hall to do something with it.  We can play it one more time.  Oh, I got it.  No, I don't have it.  The other Buffalo Bill made more sense.  Like, um, like, um.  In the brief pause, can I say I'm doing red-eye tonight?  Ooh!  Boo!  No! 
[03:28:30]  Fucking homer.  Boo is the best.  Oh, fucking homer.  I'll always take that boo and enjoy it.  Boo.  Uh, like, um, like, um, Michelle, we'll play it again.  It's a, uh, Buffalo Bill.  Ellis Lanksdale at a press conference yesterday.  The Buffalo Bill made more sense.  I just got that.  I'm tired.  Did you peel off of your assignment when you saw where the ball was headed?  Yes, sir.  How'd that work?  Just walking through that.  Like, um, like, um, I just, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, like, um, I was, 
[03:29:00]  um, like, um, um, like, um, I was, um, just, um, like, um, I was, I was just  reading, right?  In the late round pick, how much of a sense of urgency did you feel you have to try to  make an early impression and continue to be on that?  Like, um, I was, like, um, I was, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, I was a seven  round pick, so, like, um, so, like, um.  Okay.  Poor fucking guy.  Jesus.  Like, um, like, um, like, um, like, um, like, um, um, someone's saying there are two 
[03:29:30]  edits in the damn like-up video.  Someone getting very mad on instant feedback.  Yeah.  You can see it and hear it.  I thought I saw a skip.  A little skip.  But I thought I did see a skip.  He's still saying like-um a lot.  Yeah.  Let me just say, if, if there's an edit, if there's one or two edits in that video, it's  still a lot of like-um.  He says like-um 74 times.  Like-um, like-um, like-um, like-um.  I think there was one, there's one that I think was questionable.  I was looking at the actual waveform, like, visually, and there's one that looks a little 
[03:30:00]  too close to another one.  Like-um.  But aside from that, it's, he, they're different like-ums the entire time.  Like-um.  They're all different.  Like-um.  People are asking if that Bills player went to college.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Like-um.  This is his first, uh, he's a rookie, but he played college ball.  You know what, Astor?  I think we did enough radio.  Oh, I'm with you.  Yep.  Someone says, uh, Ant, what's your view on a fair tax?  Uh, 10% for everybody.  10% for everybody in the country that is working. 
[03:30:30]  They have to pay.  If you make fucking $15,000 a year, you have to pay 10% of your income.  You don't get fucking refund.  You don't get this, you don't that.  It, it, it, 10% of your income, everyone from top to bottom, flat fucking tax.  There.  Didn't Steve Forbes say 17% would work?  But that would be more money for the rich people, Anthony.  Yeah, exactly.  A lot more money for the rich people.  Fuck all y'all.  I don't mind not paying more money.  Like, um.  Even if it's more than 10%.  17%.  Whatever it works out to be that isn't half, uh, I'm game. 
[03:31:00]  All right, so.  And, and it's flat tax where everyone pays.  Everyone.  All right.  I don't care what the fuck you're making.  You, you fucking pay your share.  This is where I'm at.  So then.  Not me pay your share.  So we get rid of Obama and we bring another Republican in there.  So then how much.  It's going to be the same shit.  Thank you.  But.  That's where I'm at.  But.  That's where I'm at.  That's where I'm at.  But it's not going to be a socialist same shit.  It's not going to be socialism same shit.  It's not going to be some guy trying to sneak fucking, uh, uh, a fucking socialized medicine 
[03:31:30]  program, uh, that's going to cost the whole country more than it's worth and, uh, be shit, uh, medical care.  That's the difference.  I don't want a socialist in the fucking White House.  We need a wig.  The wigs were very good.  I like the wigs.  That's a John Fogarty party.  But they spell it wrong.  They always spell that word wrong.  Whigs.  Whigs.  Whigs.  Costume.  Now we have something else that sounds like that.  Costume.  Whoa.  Hey.  What?  Oh, now.  Whoa. 
[03:32:00]  All right.  Easy, feller.  Ooh, someone has a crush on you.  Let's end with this.  Joanna.  Ava, you're on.  Joanna.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hi.  Hi.  I started watching, I mean, watching, sorry.  I'm listening to the show.  Yes.  Mainly because my husband's, like, obsessed with it.  Yes.  And I end up getting a crush on Anthony.  Cool.  Oh.  That's so nice.  You have a husband, though, huh? 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  Damn.  Where are you from?  I can fantasize California.  Oh.  One of those California blonde girls?  No, I'm not blonde.  Ew.  Oh, well.  Dang it.  Sorry.  I was just wondering.  The cool chicks aren't blonde in California.  Huh?  Back in the old days, they were.  I would assume the cool chicks aren't blonde in California because everyone else is blonde.  Right?  Yep.  Because she, I mean, just your reaction.  That's probably not a good thing to be blonde in California anymore. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  It's cliche.  Well, tell your husband thanks for listening.  No problem.  Have a good day, guys.  All right, Joanna.  Joanna from California.  Yeah, we'll try.  Thanks a lot.  Had it with her.  All right.  Yeah, enough of her and her whore crush.  Yes.  Jimmy, are you back tomorrow?  I am back tomorrow.  Yay.  And then what happens?  I get on a plane to L.A.  An aeroplane?  I do.  Let's fly through the air.  Thursday, I do the Aussie tribute, which I'm so psyched about. 
[03:33:30]  And I'll get to meet him, I think.  You've met Aussie.  I know.  But I'm happy to be doing something that he's-  How many times do you need to meet one guy?  This is the first time I'm ever doing something creative, though, that is specifically-  I thought you were going to stop right there.  You're fucking-  You're fucking mean.  It's just completely called for in rice.  The nerve of me.  About to get off on a pontificated tangent.  I'll fucking- I'll- I'll think of that, too, when I'm talking to Billy Bob. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, what?  Well, the tributers, the guys- there's only four of us doing it.  Well, there's five.  There's one guy hosting it.  I'm- I'm going-  Is this going to be on TV?  I don't know.  They've got to film this five thing.  Billy Bob Thornton?  The Billy Bob?  Well, here's the guys tributing Aussie.  Mm-hmm.  It's me, Slash, Henry Rollins, and Billy Bob Thornton.  Wow.  That's a nice line-up.  So now-  Are you going to get a picture with Billy Bob, you think?  And then you'll have one with-  Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.  And with Carl. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, you know that.  That's what I do.  I talk to him.  That picture is great with you and Dwight Yoakam.  He was very nice, too.  Was he nice?  Very nice, yeah.  I was wondering about that.  He had wrecked his motorcycle that day, too.  He was in pain.  Really?  On his way over to the show, he had flipped his motorcycle, and he was all cut up and stuff,  and he was hurt.  God damn.  Yeah, he was a very cool guy.  Dodging some hunched-over retard, I'm sure.  I almost- I was going to Twitter- I Twittered the picture, and I said with- you know, get the  fuck you, tunin' son of a bitch.  But I was going to Twitter, uh, cocksuckers and retards, because it was a funny quote. 
[03:35:00]  But then it's Twitter, and you don't know if they're going to throw you off.  But my girlfriend, uh, no.  She pointed out, you're doing Leno's show.  What are you doing Twittering that?  Like, out of context, that just looks so bad.  What's wrong with you?  And I'm like, God-  She talked sense into your head.  But I just saw what a nightmare that could have been.  Yes.  Having to explain that.  Yeah.  No, it's from a movie that's-  He said that, and-  What?  I'm what?  Didn't he say other things?  Yeah.  Yeah, plenty.  This guy wants to show you that, uh, well, let him explain. 
[03:35:30]  Dan in Albany.  Dan?  Yeah, what's up, Oak?  Hi, Dan.  How do you guys know that this guy's, uh, trying to pull a super trooper's bet?  As a rookie, how do you know T.O. didn't offer him a couple of jeans?  He's like, listen, how many times can you say like him before you get done with their interview?  Why, you want to try it or something?  I don't want to count it out.  Feel free.  Okay.  Okay.  No, it says, how do we know like him guy wasn't doing a bit? 
[03:36:00]  See how many times I can say like him.  Would that be you, Dan?  Like him.  I think that's an example of what he meant.  Yeah, see how many times I can say like him.  How do we know the guy wasn't doing a bit like?  See how many times I can say like him.  Like the guy.  There's no way he's ever heard it.  I know what you're talking about.  Super troopers, right?  Yeah.  Well, was this in Super Troopers?  No, but it was something like it where he said.  Like it?  No.  I never saw a Super Trooper. 
[03:36:30]  What was the word?  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Oh.  You know how fast you were going meow?  And that was, what's his name?  Fuck.  Been on our show a few times.  All right, Dan.  Very pale comic.  Let me go to Tracy because Tracy has a crush on Anthony as well.  What?  Tracy in Georgia.  Tracy.  Hi, guys.  How's Tracy Morgan here?  Hi, Anthony.  Get you pregnant, yo.  Am I on the air?  Put a baby in your belly.  Yes, Tracy.  Second Tracy.  My mom and dad listen to you guys, and I just wanted to say I have a crush on Ant, and I want to bone him. 
[03:37:00]  But I don't know what that really means because my dad says that to my mom a lot.  So I just wanted Ant to know.  That's adorable.  How old are you, Tracy?  I'm 14.  You're a real character, aren't you?  I'm going to be called five years ago.  Tracy.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Very funny, you little shit. 
[03:37:30]  Hey, don't yell at me, Ant.  I swear to God, when I see you, I'm going to beat you down.  Her voice sounds familiar.  It's Kat.  I knew it was Kat.  Who's Kat?  Take it easy.  I knew that was her.  Who's Kat?  It's Kat.  It's Babykins.  Oh.  You know Babykins.  No, I don't.  Yeah, she came to the show one day.  All right, where do we go home now?  Just hang out.  And she said, when was the last time you saw a 14-year-old smoking a pack of $10 clove cigarettes?  She's pissed because that's all she smokes. 
[03:38:00]  By the way, may I ask?  We had a girl in here before the vacation.  No penis.  No.  Sorry.  Who was very lovely.  Who you were smitten with.  Oh, yes, exactly.  Right, right.  The intern?  Yeah.  Over at Kavino and Richie's show.  Right.  Whatever happened with that?  Oh, what happened?  Oh, no.  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  You know, like chit-chat, but never got past the chit-chat point. 
[03:38:30]  It happens.  It's supposed to, you know, actually, I think, go somewhere or something.  But it never happened.  That was a month ago.  Hey, Mongo, we'll leave you with Mongo.  Mongo?  The last-minute BHG line, bacon-hoarding goon.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. </pre>
