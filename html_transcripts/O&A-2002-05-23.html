<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a blistering, profanity-laced attack on Don and Mike, their predecessors in the timeslot.  Opie and Anthony mocked Don and Mike's low ratings (.8), impending cancellation, and perceived desperation, repeatedly calling them "pussies" and "losers" while boasting about their own success and syndication.  The segment included numerous phone calls from listeners, some supporting their aggressive stance and others criticizing it. Don and Mike themselves called in multiple times, escalating the insult-laden exchange. Opie and Anthony threatened to send Don and Mike's belongings to JFK airport via U-Haul.  They also discussed their show's success in various markets, notably Cleveland, upcoming guest Lewis Black, and celebrity boxing.

The show then shifted to a discussion of celebrity boxing matches, sparked by caller Ron Polillo's account of his disastrous bout with Dustin Diamond ("Screech"), which resulted in an eye injury despite an agreement to avoid head shots.  The conversation moved to Joey Buttafuoco's boxing match, with callers and hosts expressing disgust at his aggressive behavior against his female opponent.

This transitioned into criticism of David Blaine's endurance stunt, deemed silly and pointless. The discussion took a darkly humorous turn, focusing on death and decomposition, particularly Chandra Levy's recently discovered remains. Callers shared morbid anecdotes and observations, prompting graphic descriptions and further dark humor from the hosts and callers.

Comedian Lewis Black made a brief in-studio appearance.  CeCe DeVille also called in, discussing his upcoming tour and his dislike for certain bands.  Other random humorous comments and discussions, including one about the Washington Redskins, were interspersed throughout.

A segment detailing their "Cell Dropping Tour," which started in Tupelo, Mississippi, followed.  A new Poison song featuring CeCe DeVille was played, leading to a sexually suggestive conversation with DeVille on the phone involving aging, Viagra, and his sexual exploits. The hosts then reviewed Poison's new album art, "Holly Weird."

Next, a cheerleader selection process for their softball game took place, with Christy being judged by the hosts and others in the studio through a secret ballot system. This was accompanied by crude sexual comments and demeaning remarks about Christy.  Joni Lauer (formerly China in WWE) then called in to discuss her celebrity boxing match against Joey Buttafuoco, detailing his dirty fighting.

Jimmy Schubert called, discussing his stand-up comedy experiences, including filling in for Opie and his poor performance in a film with Rich Voss and Jim Norton.  Sexually explicit anecdotes and offensive jokes about celebrities were prevalent. The film "White Chicks" (or a similar titled film, "White Chicks Incorporated"), featuring Norton and Voss, was discussed at length, highlighting their supposedly terrible acting. The upcoming celebrity softball game was also discussed further. Lewis Black was present in the studio for a portion of this segment before departing.

A significant portion focused on "White Chicks Incorporated," a low-budget comedy starring Jimmy Norton, with Norton describing his performance as "terrible."  He recounted an anecdote about his manager's reaction to the premiere.  Audio clips were played, and the film's plot, involving a voodoo doctor, fame, and sex, was detailed. Jeff Parami (a "big, fat comic" from Pennsylvania) and Jeff Norris (an "amateur comic"), fellow actors in the film, were also mentioned. The hosts joked about the film's website, www.whitechick.com.

The show concluded with the "What Did We Learn Today?" segment, featuring callers sharing humorous and often nonsensical observations about Sam Snead's death, David Blaine, Chandra Levy's death, and other topical news and pop culture references.  Rich Voss was a guest in the studio for this segment.  The show ended with further disparaging remarks about Ron and Fez.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We got their radios turned up real loud today.  Everyone listening in to the Opie and Anthony show.  You can act like a man!  That's right.  What's the matter with you?  Oh, it's okay, Don.  It's okay, Don.  Yes, yes.  Suckle, suckle, Don. 
[00:00:30]  Suckle from the breast of this program.  Hi, listen, Mickey.  Why don't you don't knit me a sweater before I slap you in the face?  Suckle.  Wow.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  I got a phone call, and for the first time in I don't know how long, I listened to this station on my drive-in.  Step in.  It's going to be a bumpy ride. 
[00:01:00]  Good strategy, Don.  A little late, though.  A little late.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Yeah.  Cleveland!  Goddamn, you guys in Cleveland.  And D.C.  Yes.  866-277-4WOW.  If you're outside of New York and Cleveland and D.C. and other cities, 866-277-4WOW. 
[00:01:30]  Bobby, I can't see you over there.  Could you move your skateboard?  Because it's totally in the way of my line of sight here.  Entertaining.  That's what I call it.  I give them that.  They finally had an entertaining show in New York City.  Bravo.  Bravo, boys.  Bravo.  But a little too late, huh?  Yeah.  Unfortunately, it's just a little too late.  You want to start one of these, I don't know, a little radio battle thing or something? 
[00:02:00]  You probably should have done something while it mattered.  Well, let's start by saying, because we're on a lot of cities, Anthony.  Yeah.  We're on something like 22 cities now.  A lot more than Don and Mike, so now we have to tell everyone what's going on.  You see, Don and Mike, they're not really in our league, but we'll come down to their  level for this little discussion before we move on and actually do an entertaining show  for everyone today.  Have a little fun.  Obviously, they didn't have much to talk about today, so they had to rip into us.  Don and Mike, they're the show on before us here in New York City. 
[00:02:30]  After being on in New York City for two and a half years, I don't know.  Is that all?  It seems like 10 effing years have gone by.  Probably a little less than two and a half years.  I really don't know.  I want to try to stick with the facts.  They are failing miserably during middays at this radio station in New York City.  Right.  So bad.  It's ridiculous, actually.  They've got a .8 rating.  .8 rating. 
[00:03:00]  Now that they know the end is near, and that is a fact, Don and Mike will be off the air  in New York City in the very near future.  It's imminent.  The end is imminent.  That's why I'm a little embarrassed for them, because they had two and a half years to take  their shots at us and fight back and do what they had to do to kind of build an audience  and defend themselves.  Now you smell the end right there, just nipping at you, and now you decide to do something.  They figured as they're leaving New York, they're going to try to take as many shots  at us as possible.  You know what, Don and Mike? 
[00:03:30]  You know, a little too late.  A little too late.  You're a bunch of pussies.  Everyone thinks you're pussies for doing it this way.  A little late.  You know, why don't you be a man and realize that you failed miserably in New York, and  it's over for you guys.  Okay?  But no, you're going to take your shots now and try to explain to your faithful listeners  that the reason you failed in New York horribly, I mean, it's an embarrassment, is because  no, I didn't support you.  You know what?  That's something you're going to have to take with you for whatever career you have left,  is the fact that you failed miserably in New York City, the number one market. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  And there's no spinning it.  It's not like getting on and saying that people spin ratings, numbers, or this, that.  This is fact.  You sucked in New York City.  It didn't work, and you will be gone from this station.  We are meeting new shows every day.  What do you think?  They're parading the new programs in here for this slot?  You know, the one we got because we got the backing of the company?  Yeah, the three to seven shift. 
[00:04:30]  That one.  You think they're parading shows in to replace that?  No.  No, they're parading shows in here.  They're just desperately trying to find anything to put in that might get a rating better than  a .8.  And as soon as they find a show, they're gone.  It's just a matter of time now.  They're completely gone.  If they had a show to plug in today, you know what?  You wouldn't have heard Don and Mike going off on Opie and Anthony.  Right.  And Ron and Fez and the rest of the gang here at N.E.W.  Uh-huh.  So, you know, I feel bad for the guys.  I mean, they gave it a good shot. 
[00:05:00]  You know?  They did.  They were passed up by the company.  They were passed up by their own hometown station.  Uh-huh.  For us.  And they're holding a grudge.  What can I tell you?  I'll tell you one thing.  If someone came to us in the company and said, hey, guys, I know you did a pretty good job  for us.  But you know what?  We're going to move you to middays to make room for these new guys.  You know.  Bye-bye.  And I would probably walk.  You'd go bye-bye.  And then what?  You see, I don't know.  There's a lot of other radio companies out there.  Maybe you'd do better with one of them. 
[00:05:30]  We'd walk.  We'd go get a job across the street.  And then we'd kick their asses.  Yeah.  That's the way you do it.  But, you know, you allow the company and your hometown station to do that to you.  And you've been holding a grudge ever since.  They've bought them a little more time here, I think, as far as, well, we're not live in  New York.  That's what it is.  It's the tape dealer.  All right.  Here you go.  We'll put you on live.  What happened?  The show that was here before, the radio chick.  We hated the radio chick.  Everyone knows that.  We hated her, too. 
[00:06:00]  There was no support there.  And she did ten times better.  We'll stick with the facts.  Probably three times better.  Eight?  Let's see.  She had in the twos.  She had in the two shares.  And she was on before us for a while.  And we openly hated her.  So what happened there, Donna Mike?  What happened there?  Well.  What's the excuse there?  Mm-hmm.  You know, Don, Leslie Gold, who you befriended and used to talk, you know, behind our backs  with?  Yeah.  You guys were all buddy-buddy, knowing the whole time that you were going to take her 
[00:06:30]  job?  Yeah.  That's the kind of guy you are.  And turned it into what?  A point eight.  A point eight.  To talk to me on air.  Yeah, sure.  Bye-bye, Don.  Bye-bye.  It was a good shot, though, Don.  Oh, what?  Now, you don't want to discuss it?  Sure.  Well, there's nothing to discuss.  Let's discuss it.  Let's discuss your ratings on WJFK in my home market.  Absolutely, Don.  Fun.  Let's do it.  Fun.  How does it feel to be in 14th place?  Not bad at all. 
[00:07:00]  We're still building an audience.  Are you really?  Yes.  Hell yeah.  Not from the numbers I'm looking at.  Don, we are doing so much better than you are doing in New York.  That's what you're doing.  I don't dispute that, but I have the numbers in front of me from D.C.  And about those New York numbers, why don't you be specific when you say you're number  one in all male demographics?  We are number one men, 18 plus, number one men, 18 to 49.  That's what we were hired to do.  Yes.  Yes.  And what are the numbers? 
[00:07:30]  Who cares?  We're number one.  I don't have them in front of me.  So you're number one, 18 to 34.  And plus, Don, are we number one men, 18 plus in Washington, D.C. with this trend?  Uh, let me look, and I will tell you, I know you're down.  It doesn't matter.  We're number one men, 18 plus in Washington, D.C. with the trend that came up.  Yes, which is not the goal.  Yes.  Thank you.  You're such a dick.  Did your skateboard fall and hit the button? 
[00:08:00]  Thank you, Don.  You want to talk about success stories in syndication?  I'm not going to nitpick with a guy that's a complete loser in New York City.  Failure.  We don't want some of that failure rubbing off on us, Opie, here in New York City.  You know.  How about Cleveland numbers today?  Boy, there's a proven success story for the O&A show.  Dude, we're killing all over the place.  Yeah.  And we're doing just fine in D.C.  Philly, Boston.  I'll say.  And, yeah, we're building an audience in D.C. 
[00:08:30]  Don, don't do this to yourself.  Is it possible that you could not be a stupid?  Don't do this to yourself, Don.  You're looking really silly.  Let me read you the trend reversal.  You're looking really silly.  Like I said to start this show today, it's a desperate man.  I feel bad for him.  He is very desperate.  He would never, never have called to take the abuse if he wasn't a completely desperate man.  You don't see Ant and I calling his show. 
[00:09:00]  Absolutely not.  Or anyone else, for that matter.  We will do just fine in D.C. with no help.  Yeah, yeah.  From Don Geronimo.  We don't need any help to get an audience for our radio show.  And you know what?  If we do fail eventually in D.C., we're not failing right now.  No.  Then at least I could walk away and go, you know, Ant and I did our best.  It's just not going to happen in Washington, D.C.  We're not going to cry that we didn't have Don's support.  Looks like Frida's on the line.  Hey, Don.  Hey, Don.  We're calling the U-Haul, so we're going to do you a favor. 
[00:09:30]  We're going to pack up all your bags in New York.  Before you hang up, because you're afraid to hear the truth, and you're afraid for your  audience to hear the truth.  You mean the truth that you're done in New York, and you're going to be fired?  Here's the truth.  Here's the truth, Anthony.  Yeah.  The truth is we'll continue broadcasting in D.C., and Don and Mike will not be broadcasting  in New York City.  That's the truth.  There you go.  Yeah.  Are you listening to these numbers?  Absolutely.  These numbers are not going up, asswipe.  They're going down.  No, they're not.  Oh, no, Don.  Really?  Really?  I think you're smart enough in that. 
[00:10:00]  Very great news.  As far as...  Oh!  Woo!  Wow!  That hasn't been known.  Oh, my God.  Don't you want to hang up on me?  Oh, my God.  That was a mic source on the air.  Wow, he's got my real name, Anthony.  Ouch.  Oh, my God.  How?  You forgot to do A.K.A., fat boy.  It's actually getting embarrassing.  How sad is it?  I know.  Now I kind of feel bad.  I do feel bad. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, my God.  I feel really bad.  The fact is, we'll continue in D.C., and they will not be continuing in New York.  You know what the truth of the matter is, too?  If you're the Don and Mike show, and you get relegated to middays, where you now have  to sit, you better count your blessings that your ratings went up.  If you're in a city for 15 years, and you build an audience, and you go to middays, you  better, you should just pray every night that your ratings stay high in D.C., because 
[00:11:00]  you've got nothing else going on.  You've failed in New York, in the number one market.  That's on your resume.  You have a, you know what company you have?  Darian O'Toole.  Danny Bonadouchebag.  That elite few that have just completely crashed and burned in New York.  Now, Don, you're part of that.  You're part of that fraternity.  Tom Lickass.  You're part of that.  Have that go with you. 
[00:11:30]  Because you failed.  And as far as Washington goes, you should count your blessings you're doing well.  Count your blessings you were able to get most of your audience from afternoons to listen  to me on middays.  The fact of the matter is, we had a lot lower ratings in D.C. in our time slot a couple  of months ago.  We flushed out the people that did not want to hear us because they were used to your brand  of humor. 
[00:12:00]  And that audience is building.  There's no denying that.  Read from a trend.  Go ahead, Don.  I could pull up trends from this station that go back a lot further than we've been in D.C.  And they're consistently nothing.  Nothing.  Pull up our trends from D.C.  Watch.  See where we were two months ago.  Are we hired, Don?  Of course we are.  It's building.  When you go outside of this station in New York City, are there hundreds upon hundreds 
[00:12:30]  of people waiting for you to sign stuff, shake hands, have a beer with you?  No.  When we were at JFK a couple of weeks back, that was a goddamn crowd of people, man.  Rabid fans from your backyard, Mr. Geronimo, hanging out.  Not ten people at a bowling alley in Jersey.  You nothing.  You failed in New York, Don.  Failed.  Pack your crap and leave.  Actually, we'll do it for you, Don. 
[00:13:00]  Rick, you got the number?  We just need an address to send their stuff to you.  That's it.  JFK.  We're getting a U-Haul here.  We're taking all of your unfunny crap from your office, loading it in the U-Haul, and  you can pick it up at JFK because you're not welcome back here.  We don't like failures and losers to share the microphone here at this station.  Okay?  Bad enough you stink it up with your friggin' breath. 
[00:13:30]  The last thing you have to do is stink up the atmosphere with your unfunniness.  There you go.  There you go.  Not welcome back here.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Oh, well, they'd be off the air tomorrow if we had something to put in.  Put a god-effing chimp on the air.  It'll get a .9.  A .8.  You know, in New York City where there's so many people, a .8 really isn't that bad. 
[00:14:00]  Is that what the sales staff is supposed to tell clients?  Don Geronimo says, .8, not that bad.  It sucks.  But we won't have to worry about it much longer.  There's no coming back from this, Don.  You're done.  You failed in New York.  As you drive around D.C., between 3 and 7, you'll still have to hear Opie and Anthony.  You'll still hear our show. 
[00:14:30]  In New York, nothing.  I won't have to have your annoying voice and your wife's annoying effing voice coming out of my god-effing radio from the seat that I sit in.  A winner's seat, not a loser's seat, Don.  Look at Mike and Buzz's eyes when you pick up the phone from Frida.  They're disgusted.  It's not funny, it's not entertaining, and it sucks every effing day with her.  I am so glad we will not have to listen to that in New York. 
[00:15:00]  I'm sure the listeners, the eight of them, will care.  We might have one on the phone now.  Chris, what's up?  Oh, Nate, what's going on?  Hey.  Listen, I love you guys, but you're kind of acting like bitches today.  Don wants to get in a little argument.  So let the man say what he has to say.  He had four hours to say what he had to say during his show.  We let him have his piece. 
[00:15:30]  He didn't see me and Opie calling up his show.  What, now we're supposed to get into some debate with him?  No, Don says, this is getting pathetic.  It sure is, Don.  Stop calling.  Well, he wants to be on our show so people could actually hear what he had to say on his show.  Exactly.  What's the matter, Don?  No one heard what you said in New York?  Is that what happened, Don?  No one heard what you said in New York?  What you point at?  You are the biggest pussies I have ever met in my life.  This is getting pathetic, Don.  You are the biggest pussies.  You're real good at hiding and running.  Let's talk about your little motif in the studio where no one makes eye contact with you, 
[00:16:00]  that you must have the hallways cleared before you walk through the hallways.  Oh, and I love the phony laughter.  Oh, Don, that is a gem.  Whatever amount of money you dumb Fs want.  Hey, Don, I can bring in the whole staff.  I can bring in the whole staff.  I can bring in the whole staff and they would say that is not true.  A-O-D.  You're talking about forced laughter.  What the hell is that about?  That we clear the hallways? 
[00:16:30]  Oh, my.  That's a good one.  That's a hot one.  Clear the hallways.  Like you clear the phone lines before we come in.  We come into empty phones.  Clear the hallways?  Stop it.  Oh, my.  Get real.  The only reason we're clear in the hallways is so I can skate through on my skateboard.  On his skateboard.  Where I got from the skate shop.  The skateboard stand.  Oh, yeah.  The skate stand.  Oh, dear. 
[00:17:00]  Keep listening, Don.  Keep listening to a show that people listen to.  Keep listening to the show that replaced you in Washington, D.C.  There you go.  That's the facts.  You were passed up by the company.  You were passed up by your own hometown station.  For us.  You failed miserably here.  And there's no denying it.  There's no excuses for it.  Done.  Hey, anyone see Celebrity Boxing?  That was great.  Did you see it, Don? 
[00:17:30]  We're screeched to your horse shack.  Why does he keep trying to call?  God, is that sad.  Because he's obsessed with us.  That is sad.  Take a Xanax and relax.  Jesus.  Oh, my.  My stars. 
[00:18:00]  Evan, what's up?  Clear the field.  Clear the hallways.  Hope he's coming through.  On his skateboard.  And his baggy pants.  Clear the hallways.  And his hat that's on sideways.  By the way, Don, Godsmack hasn't put out an album in over a year now.  Yeah.  When you want to talk about newer music or something like that, pick a new band.  Pick an album that just came out.  And you're right.  The Eminem thing was no big deal.  Yeah.  You know.  Being all over MTV and VH1 is really no big deal for a radio guy. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, you're right.  Just by doing your show, not by sending out press releases that you're going to have some bitch from some TV show on your show that no one picked up on anyway.  Sending out your own press releases.  Hey, look who's going to be on our show.  No one picked it up.  No one cares.  Another desperate move.  Another desperate move.  Why don't you just have a pleasure ourself with some plastic items on the mic.  That might be interesting to listen to.  And it would smell better when it was done.  Oh, gosh. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Evan, what's up?  For the love of Ian.  Not much, guys.  I was listening to their show.  Sorry about that.  I used to be on the radio.  Naughty language.  Oh, yeah.  Terrible.  I thought it was crazy.  They're acting just like Piazza.  Somebody called them gay, and now they're trying to defend themselves like they got some of the proof.  You know what this is, to be totally real here, it's a desperate move.  No, what's really weird is we have pretty much left them alone.  We take a jab here and there, but nothing major.  I mean, we've been just putting on quality radio for the last six months or so. 
[00:19:30]  We were told, we were told, please, could you do us a favor and not bash Don and Mike?  If they make it or fail, it's going to be of their own accord and not because you bashed them.  You know what?  You know something?  Fine.  We will do our show.  Believe it or not, believe it or not, Don, we'd go, oh, hours without thinking of Don.  We have a show to do, so we do it.  They tried bashing you guys for hours today, and then at the end they were trying to apologize and say, oh, we hope you're the best. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, stop this.  Right, because, you know, deep down there, they're both very insecure.  It's a desperate move.  They act all tough on the radio, but behind the scenes they're crying.  Yeah, they're just like Piazza, a couple of catchers.  He's very aware that we absolutely do not need him in D.C., and he absolutely needed us in New York, and when we just sat back and let him do what he wanted to do, he failed miserably.  And it's not our fault that he decided to put us in afternoon drive. 
[00:20:30]  It's not our responsibility to help other shows either.  I'd rather fail in D.C. knowing that we'd try to do it on our own.  You guys work in the center of the universe right there.  You work in New York City, man.  It's New York City, syndicated out to a lot of markets that are, man, loving the show.  Yeah, Washington can kiss your ass compared to New York.  Giving us great praise.  The greatest people are there.  You know what, we talked to a lot of our listeners down in D.C. when we visited recently, and they're beyond cool, man.  We got an audience down there.  We know it.  We totally know it. 
[00:21:00]  And we also have said many times in the show that it's going to take a while for us to build a huge following down in D.C.  It's going to take time.  And as long as the company gives us time, and I know they're going to, we're going to be just fine.  We're going to be just fine.  So, you know, and in all fairness, the company gave Don and Mike a really good chance to make it in New York.  And, you know, they can blame us.  They can blame whatever they want, but they've got to look at themselves.  Their type of show just did not work in New York City.  Did not work.  The only thing good they have going for their show is Leah.  Listen to her in the morning.  It's the only thing that gets me through my day at work. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  There you go.  There you go.  A rousing endorsement.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Let me go to Anthony.  Anthony, what's up?  O.P., Anthony.  Listen, I've got a lot of things to say.  O.P., follow me.  Don't go read in any instant feedback while I'm talking here, okay?  Nobody wants to hear about Frida.  We don't want to hear about your wife.  We all got wives at home.  We listen to the radio to escape.  That's number one.  Number two, isn't D.C. a Totsun town?  D.C. a what? 
[00:22:00]  A Totsun.  It's got a lot of Negroes, right?  Well, they call it Chocolate City, I think.  Chocolate City, okay.  How are you supposed to be, like, number one, in a town full of Totsuns?  How?  Okay?  Nobody cares about you, Mike.  You should let Iran and Fedders come back to middays so I could stop listening to Rush Limbaugh during the day.  Leave New York.  Go back down to D.C.  Nobody cares about you.  Nobody cares about your wife.  Nobody cares about your retarded kid and taking them out for hard shushes.  All right.  Thank you. 
[00:22:30]  Thank you.  That's not easy to listen to, either.  And we get, Ant and I get this really bad reputation that we hate all other radio shows.  Yeah.  The fact is, Ant and I have been in New York or back home in New York now four years, and they have just piled a bunch of crap around us.  Mm-hmm.  No one will argue that.  Right.  No one will argue that.  You bastard.  Wow, you do a great Fez impression.  That's why we love those guys.  That's a great Fez impression, okay?  Bastards.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny. 
[00:23:00]  That's funny.  That's funny.  I'll tell you for the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve.  I bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show today. 
[00:23:30]  I play a game, Opie.  Oh, yeah?  It's called Secret Sound.  The Secret Sound.  Okay.  What's this sound?  Uh, I don't know.  Oh.  Can I guess?  It's, uh, yes?  Can we hear it again?  Oh!  I don't know.  It sounds fat.  So Don hanging himself after the Opie and Anthony show today. 
[00:24:00]  Maybe he's all revved up.  You know, the one thing, this is pretty funny.  He says, uh, I like to spin ratings, Anthony.  Spin ratings, right?  Mm-hmm.  That's why I set him up so effing bad.  He doesn't realize how smart I am.  I'm smart.  I'm smart. 
[00:24:30]  He spent a lot of his, uh, show saying that.  We spin the ratings, Anthony.  You know, we've never lied about the ratings.  We're a show that's all about getting as many men as possible to listen to.  Mm-hmm.  Our contracts state, you guys have to be number one men 18 to 49.  Yeah.  And that's what we do.  That's what we do.  There you go.  The fact is, we love the women.  We don't have many women listening to us, which affects our overall ratings.  Mm-hmm.  And we've said all this in the past.  But he says how I spin the ratings. 
[00:25:00]  Spin them.  Spin them.  To make it look even better for us, right?  Yeah.  So I just flat out asked him on the phone this trend that came out in D.C.  I asked him, are we number one men 18 plus?  You heard his answer.  Yeah.  End of discussion.  Very good, Greg Hughes.  Greg Hughes.  Listen, Greg Hughes.  That's for two Gs.  That's great.  Because it's not Gregory.  That's great. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, Bruce, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Yo, I thought that secret sound was, you know, Don and Mike choking on your mules, dude.  Totally suckers.  I just want to proclaim you guys the new radio gods, and those guys can go take it deep.  Oh, dear.  Thank you, my friend.  Oh, gosh, golly.  Don't be talking.  Oh, jeepers.  This is the fat guys who agree with everything the other one says show.  Hey, it looks like the A's are going to go all the way.  Oh, my.  I'll say. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  Sounds like so.  I don't know.  What is Frida think?  Jesus.  I like Buzz.  Buzz I like.  Oh, Jesus.  Michael, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Michael.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Listen, first of all, you know, I've listened to those guys.  I gave them a shot to begin with, okay?  There you go.  Now, I'm not 12 years old.  Hold on, Michael.  Did we tell you not to listen to them?  No.  Because that was said today, too.  No.  That subliminally, we tell our listeners not to listen to other radio shows. 
[00:26:30]  No, I give everybody a shot, you know, Pharrell, Ron and Fez, you know.  I wish we had the control over the audience like that, because I would tell all you guys  to just send us money, and we'd go retire.  Well, you know, I'm also late 30s like you guys, and I'm not 12 years old on the Internet.  Yeah, but see, we're trying to make everyone think that we're, like, in our late 20s, early  30s.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, that ant talks about video games, because he thinks that's what the young kids  want to hear.  That's what the kids want to hear of.  I sure hope I do good on my SATs. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, well, I mean, you know.  And I hang at the skate shop, because.  The skateboard stand.  Oh, stand.  I keep saying shop.  That might make too much sense.  I hang out at the skate stand, because that's what all the young guys do.  The young hipsters are doing.  23 skidoo.  Yeah, but, you know, they try to justify the age.  Let me tell you something.  It doesn't matter how old you are, as long as you're funny.  Yeah, I mean, but again, they were, like, 40, late 40s, or mid 40s, whatever they are.  They're acting like they're 12 years old, blaming you for their problems.  I mean, you didn't support them. 
[00:27:30]  Meanwhile, these guys are from Washington.  They're Washington Redskins, and they're talking about the Redskins in New York?  You're right, Florentine.  You're absolutely right.  Well, wait.  Wait, Norton.  Norton, you're the buffer, Norton.  Florentine.  It was also said today that we hide behind Jim Norton, and we allowed him to say all  our stuff for us, because we don't have the balls to say it ourselves.  Well, I mean, again, they may be number one in Wisconsin, but they're not number one in,  what is that, Bum, whatever, Iowa?  But we're hoping, Anthony, I've just got to stop the show for a second. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, you are?  I want to apologize to Super GM Ken Stevens.  Why?  Well, because he's going to have to deal with a crying disc jockey for the next hour and  a half.  A psychopath DJ?  The psychosis of Don babbling in Ken's ear.  You know what, Don?  Ken doesn't care anymore.  We're going to get fired, right, Ken?  Supposedly?  Ken will be just fine.  Norton, I'm sorry.  You're going to have to leave the show.  We're getting Shelly Long from Cheers.  She's going to be sitting in on our program. 
[00:28:30]  That's my other point.  Leah Remini?  Oh, my.  Although Shelly's going to be at a hut in Budapest, and she's going to comment on what  goes on on the show, because that really isn't too awkward sounding.  Leah's going to realize she made a horrible mistake.  She'll be gone in, I'll give her two more months.  What show is she on?  Tops.  What TV show?  She is so gone in two months.  I guess Kings and Queens may be canceled.  Maybe she's trying to look for a second stage in her life.  No, why?  She's got a cute ass.  No, why?  Because radio is not an easy thing to do, and you can't just plug in. 
[00:29:00]  Plug in a little satellite feed and have someone somewhere else in the country and just assume  it's all going to work.  It's going to be a disaster.  All right, so these guys are gone, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, New York, done.  I mean, they're not going to be on tomorrow.  Please tell me they're not going to be on tomorrow.  Unfortunately, see, if we did have some power, that might be true.  No, we're stuck with them until we get another show, but the fact is they're parading new  shows down the hall every day.  It's a conga line of talent coming through the hallways of this place.  I met a couple guys from The Amazing Race.  Yeah.  I'm like, I didn't even know you guys did radio. 
[00:29:30]  I'm shaking hands with people.  It's like, hey, this is this guy, and that guy.  I'm like, who the hell are these people?  That's why those guys are in.  How long has it been going on for?  I mean, did they rent or did they buy their apartments in Manhattan?  It's been going on for a while.  Michael, I'll tell you this.  I'll back up a little bit.  The last time Don and Mike tried to bait us and go after us, remember we had that meeting  with Ken and stuff?  Yeah.  Ken told us that day they were gone, so we said, okay, we'll get the last laugh once again,  so we'll just shut our mouths and do our radio show.  Like I said, nothing to you guys, but you're just doing your own show, and you really didn't 
[00:30:00]  say much about them.  No.  I mean, that's what kills me, so.  Yeah.  But now I listen to you religiously anyway, because you're entertaining.  You know what?  We knew how this was going to end, and why give them an excuse to say that, oh, it was us  that did it.  If you're a good show and you're funny, no one's going to keep you from doing well and  getting listeners.  I'll say it again.  We hated the radio chick just as much as we disliked Don and Mike, and you know what?  The radio chick ended up having three times the audience as Don and Mike in middays. 
[00:30:30]  There you go.  That's a fact that you can look up.  But, you know, I got to tell you.  Rating the radio chick did not hurt her ratings.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I'm an intelligent individual, and I listen to it.  You know, I'm entertained by you guys, but I also gave them a shot.  I did.  And to me, they just, they weren't funny.  Darian O'Mara and Mike Bonaduce.  There you go.  As far as radio in New York is concerned.  Bye-bye.  All right, guys.  I'll talk to you later.  I believe they have a failure Hall of Fame somewhere in New York for radio talent that  is coming on.  Oh, yeah.  I bet I can find it all on the web. 
[00:31:00]  Put in Jay Thomas' on that wall.  Let's do this.  Go to Yahoo.  Put in failed New York and radio and see what comes up.  I think Mark Perrano would be up on the wall.  Oh, dear.  Oh, good gosh.  Oh, my.  Mason Kalinsky.  How did your colonoscopy go?  I still haven't had one of those, so I guess I'm still kind of young.  Of course not.  You're not a dull middle-aged zilch.  No, we're close in age, those guys.  Very close. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, my God.  And doesn't it just have to do with what you enjoy doing in life?  If you want to just retire any fun that you might have and turn into sour, bitter old  men.  Curmudgeons.  Curmudgeons.  That's fine and dandy.  Go ahead.  But don't fault people that are still having a good goddamn time.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I just wanted to echo that guy.  I've been listening to you for nine months, and I couldn't get a read on you guys.  I didn't know if you loved them or hated them. 
[00:32:00]  And today's the first day I figured out that you hated them.  See?  Thank you.  There you go.  And there's tons of people calling saying that.  Tons.  Yeah, no problem.  You guys are great.  Norton rules.  Thanks, man.  We just, we never said anything.  Ah, we took our little jabs here and there.  Yeah, but never getting on and just bashing them without any reason.  Cheryl, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Listen, I gave those guys a shot also, too, right?  But what turned me off from them was this blinking Frida.  Every day. 
[00:32:30]  Every day.  They have to be calling Frida.  It was annoying and disgusting.  And those two fat flubs, when they come to New York, they need to join a New York sports club.  And just to let them know, they're old news.  Miss Cleo, tell me the future.  Read your tarot cards and tell me what is in the future for Don and Mike.  They're, listen, they're old school, okay?  You two guys are new school.  They're old school.  They need to get with that.  But we're the same age.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  So how did that happen?  Oh, please. 
[00:33:00]  His annoying wife turned listeners off.  We don't want to hear his annoying wife every morning.  And his kid that he's probably needed to join the sports club also.  Yeah.  All right.  So that's what turned off a lot of listeners.  He's calling his annoying wife every day.  All right.  Every day.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  That's Cheryl.  Call me now.  Mike.  You're free reading.  Hey, Mike from D.C.  What's up?  Hey, yeah.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  You guys are talking about, like, good radio and whatnot.  How come you wouldn't debate Don and let him say what he had to say? 
[00:33:30]  Why'd you have to hang out for him?  He had four hours to, uh, say, speak his piece.  I know.  But you're saying you're good radio.  No, he said what.  That would be good radio.  It sounds like he has something to hide.  I'm trying to hide.  No, we have nothing to hide.  It's out there.  You could read it for yourselves.  Well, then why wouldn't you debate him?  What is there to hide, Mike, when I ask Don himself, uh, the latest trend that came out  today, are we number one, man 18 plus?  And he said yes.  That's all you, that's all you let him say.  That one cat.  Listen to how dull you sound.  That says a lot right there, Mike.  Listen to how dull you sound. 
[00:34:00]  I used to listen to the radio driving to my car.  You guys are so non-talented.  You sound like a Don and Mike fan.  Watch your language.  Watch your language.  Sonny boy.  Honey mouth.  Well, you have no talent.  What's the matter?  You and Dad used to listen to Don and Mike when he drove you to school before he pulled  over in the woods and put a digit in?  Hey, Mike.  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  This no-talent show took over their slot because the company has more belief in this program.  Let's hear the real truth.  You're saying you're not.  The no-talent show is successfully syndicated around the country. 
[00:34:30]  This no-talent show is consistently successful in the syndicated markets it's in.  It doesn't have a .8 anywhere.  And especially not in the number one market in the country that DJs aspire to be successful.  They worked their way up their entire career to get to New York and succeed.  And they failed miserably.  Miserably.  Some people fail in New York, but they do just good enough that another station picks 
[00:35:00]  them up and goes, well, perhaps with this, that, or the other thing, they can be successful.  You will never be back because you failed so miserably.  There you go.  There you go.  Little fan that called up there.  You can just hear that type of, what a duller.  Blah, blah, blah.  Whatever.  Of course they have their fans.  I understand that.  Of course they do.  Whatever.  But they're all dumb.  Whatever.  Like that guy from Glen Burnie. 
[00:35:30]  Well, we like a little structure down here.  Do you really?  Ugh.  Have you gotten your midlife crisis tattoo yet, Opie?  Um, I haven't gotten mine yet.  I think I have like one more year and then I'm going to get the tattoo on if I start looking  even younger.  If you want to talk about those issues, please give me a break.  You know, I'm getting older now, so if I get a tattoo, I'll feel like I'm younger.  Tattoo what?  I don't know.  I might get a cute little sparrow. 
[00:36:00]  What?  I just wish I had a boy to share it with.  Ugh.  Oh, no.  There you go.  I wish my father would suggest that.  No, stupid.  I'm not doing that.  Why don't we go out and split a hooker?  That would be nice.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Oh, boy.  Unbelievable.  I'm really...  The move of desperation.  Any of the fans, and like we said, sure, we know they have plenty of fans in D.C. 
[00:36:30]  I can't believe that Don and Mike fan got through.  It said on the screen how much, uh, you know, that guy liked our show.  I know.  Wow.  I figured I'd pump up my ego and throw on some positive calls for us.  Boy, he really surprised me.  Please, like I care.  Do you guys realize that Ant and I get off on the fact that we get under people's  skin, and we got under their skin so bad today, it's not even funny, because they know everything  we're saying is right.  They know they're finished in New York. 
[00:37:00]  They have to walk by an empty studio down there in Washington, WJFK, where they used to sit  between three and seven and see just, uh, no one in the studio and our voices coming  through the speakers.  It drives him absolutely nuts.  And that's going to continue.  The company passed him up, and his hometown station passed him up.  And that will continue.  Those are the facts.  You will be gone here.  Your voice no longer, uh, burdening the people of New York.  And, um, hey, on your afternoon drive home, you know, the time you used to be on the air,  you could listen to Opie and Anthony. 
[00:37:30]  There you go.  There you go, Don.  Uh, Walter, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  I tell you, I love you guys, Joe.  I listen to you every day on the way home from work.  How does this guy get hired to be a program director?  They, uh, they gave him a title that meant nothing.  What the hell is that all about?  No, it meant nothing.  Jeremy from New York was overseeing the station, and they got another guy, Charlie, that runs  the station on a day-to-day basis, and they gave him a cute little, uh, uh, title,  PD of creative programming something, something, something. 
[00:38:00]  And then he called the trades, uh, yesterday or this morning to tell her when he quit,  but he quit.  But he wasn't really the program director.  It was just a title.  I mean, it was sick.  I happened to listen to him a little bit yesterday because I left work early.  And you guys had to come on.  He talked about how he quit, and he's telling Jeremy off, and I said, Jesus.  Yeah, he quit.  I got a problem.  Later, guys.  He quit his job, his PD, because he wanted to put Echo on the station, and they wouldn't let him. 
[00:38:30]  Is that what they're saying?  That's how he's, talk about spinning something.  Yeah, they wanted to put reverb on the station like they do at the old, uh, 70s, uh, stations.  The oldies stations.  Put an echo on the station.  That is horrible.  Oh, God.  Ugh.  And, uh, that's the excuse.  Hey, what's this?  Oh, what do you got there?  Uh, from DM Fan in D.C., F you losers, Don and Mike for life.  Oh.  F you losers, Don and Mike for life.  Oh. 
[00:39:00]  Written about 25 times.  There you go.  Boy, I must say, that's going to really hurt me today.  And it's just the way that one of their fans would write something.  That's the point.  An ONA fan would call up and say something really, really, really vicious.  No, that hurts, though.  That one got to me.  You guys stink at lives.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  Thank you, Fasso.  You better hope you do well in Philly, my friends.  You so better hope.  Ah, let's go to Gail. 
[00:39:30]  Gail, what's up?  Yeah, I was wondering if we had to be tortured listening to them in Philly still.  Well, Gail, let me, let me, uh, let me tell you this.  All right, let me talk to Philly, okay, please?  Philly, I am begging you.  Now, I am pleading with you to give Don and Mike a chance.  And I'll tell you why.  Because when they fail miserably in Philly, they'll have no one to blame but themselves.  Okay?  Give them a chance.  Give them a listen.  Try again, Gail. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, I can't do it.  Give them another try, people in Philly.  Yeah, I'm with Opie on this one.  Just give them a try.  If you like them, stick with them.  I'm sick of people blaming us for their failures.  Yeah.  So give them a chance.  And that Mike guy?  Give it the old college try.  Why would he be listening to you if he doesn't like you?  No, uh, Don?  Well, it is Mike also.  Mike's source.  Oh, well, Don, uh, I can't speak for Mike, but Don is so obsessed with this whole thing.  He listens to us every day as he's driving around in his Cadillac. 
[00:40:30]  And, uh, I get, because it gets back to me, he's convinced that we talk about him every  day, that we take these little subliminal, uh, jabs.  Yeah.  And then he calls Ken and stuff.  We were talking about something from, uh, this Photoshopcontest.com where someone put  our heads on these two tourists with these really, really bad collared shirts and stuff.  I'm like, ugh, we would never wear collared shirts.  He was convinced we were talking about him and Mike.  I know.  Yeah, he's a waste.  That is weird.  He really should have been shot in the toilet.  It was just a really bad photo with our heads on it. 
[00:41:00]  Had nothing to do with them, but, uh, but, you know, he thought we were talking about  him.  I don't know.  We're out of time.  All right, yeah.  But please, Philly, give him a shot.  Yeah.  I don't want to be blamed for their failure in Philly as well.  My God.  I'm doing so well.  So well.  And poor Cleveland today.  Yeah.  Why?  They put on the station out there?  We killed. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  We killed in the ratings today in Cleveland.  Unbelievable.  We are.  This is the first time this has happened to this show.  The first time.  This hasn't even happened in New York yet.  Yeah.  With everybody listening to Afternoon Drive Radio, we are number one in Cleveland right  now.  12 plus, as they say.  They call it 12 plus, which means old man, young man, old women, young women.  I mean, everybody.  Yeah.  For the first time for this show, we have become number one in a city. 
[00:42:00]  By a lot.  By a lot.  We never did that in Boston.  And the closest we came in New York was, I think, fourth place overall.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, boy.  But for the first time ever, Cleveland gave us the number one spot today.  Number one.  You guys in Cleveland.  Oh, dear.  Oh, gosh.  It's a little success story in our syndication.  One of the many.  Agree with each other.  Not just sitting around talking about how well you're doing in a city you've been 15 years 
[00:42:30]  in.  Jeez, I would hope you're doing well.  And something else you can look up, D.C., because we do try to stick with the facts.  The first four books that Don and Mike had in D.C., they didn't get above a three share.  Hmm.  It's a fact.  Proven it takes time to build an audience.  Those pesky facts.  And I are, I don't know, we're pushing maybe nine months now.  June, July, August, September.  Nine months.  So, we'll see what happens. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, I think I got inside the phone line of Don, as he's calling Ken Stevens, about New  York.  Shh, shh.  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's good to Washington.  Don, it's okay.  I got nothing else.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Anthony, we got...  I hear him so upset. 
[00:43:30]  Is China calling in today?  We're hoping.  Oh, my God.  China, don't blow us off.  Well, if you were a little nicer to her last time, perhaps she would call in.  I love China.  Saying she had a man ass in Playboy might not have been the way to get a return.  But I love China.  Buttafuoco looked like a scumbag during that celebrity boxing last night.  As opposed to the upstanding gentleman he normally is?  He was Buttafuoco.  Well, let's talk about celebrity boxing next.  Okay.  And that ridiculous stunt David Blaine pulled last night.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  Standing on a platform for 34 hours and then jumping on a mat.  Really?  That's basically what it was.  Yeah, it was kind of dopey.  And now they're all calling him the new Houdini.  I mean...  Oh, good gosh.  Yeah, no, I know.  You're right.  Just going to agree with everything today.  That's the way to be funny.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Also a very funny guy, Anthony.  Jimmy Schubert calling in.  Oh, he is funny.  Yeah.  Lewis Black is going to be in studio.  Ah, Lewis.  CeCe DeVille is calling us from Poison.  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  Anthony, remember...  Is that one of those new bands?  Poison? 
[00:44:30]  Look, now you're trying to be hip talking about the Poison.  I got their latest CD.  Oh, dear.  Their latest...  I didn't really, but I just want to act cool and hip.  So I have something to show the boys down at the skateboard stand.  You're going to put a helmet in your elbow pads when you skateboard past that skateboard stand.  Yep, yep, yep.  Don't want to hurt yourself.  Oh, my.  We installed a rail out there, and I'm going to try a few moves during commercials.  Oh, yeah?  I've never worn a sideways hat. 
[00:45:00]  Look at Patrick.  Yeah, we give you guys record-breaking ratings, yet you can't even stop by once a goddamn year,  dicks.  You're so right, Patrick.  Now we have to go to Cleveland.  No.  I'm just kidding.  We do.  I want to go.  Jake Moore told us we had to go to Cleveland about a year ago.  Yeah, I know.  And we haven't even been on that long, but he's like, after the first week, he goes,  you guys are blowing up in Cleveland.  You've got to get out there.  No, we have to plan something now. 
[00:45:30]  We want to go for...  You know what?  I've got to say, we want to go for Jim Norton's show.  But the station couldn't afford our demands, which turned out to be about $2,000.  No, it was just a few hotel rooms and a few flights.  Yep.  Next time Jimmy's on the show, though, Mary Lou Henna is going to be sitting in with us  from the hit TV show Taxi.  Oh, for the love of Eve.  Fuck.  And a little message to Leah.  You sounded completely ridiculous today because you had no clue what you were talking about 
[00:46:00]  as far as all this stuff goes.  Just shut your trap.  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  All right, let me get a little saucy here.  Oh, for the love of Eve, you bet.  Life serves you up lemons, you make lemonade.  We're a little out of control here.  Stop cracking lies.  Oh, my stars.  Don't f*** yourself.  Tasteless, offensive.  A lot of ass grabbing.  Horrific and tasteless.  People going deaf.  Just makes me want to stick a knife in someone. 
[00:46:30]  Stuff you get here on this show.  Aren't we supposed to be trying to gain listeners, guys?  No!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Is that a surprise to you?  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027, WNEW.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:47:00]  And thanks for checking it out.  We got lots to do today, Anthony, huh?  Oh, yeah.  We got Lewis Black in the studio.  Uh, yes.  Lewis.  Hi, guys.  Been good?  I should say real fast.  He's playing Town Hall, June 14th.  Yep.  Get your tickets now for Lewis Black.  Lewis, you seem a tad bit like a beaten.  I'm fried.  You're a little exhausted.  I'm completely fried.  You all right?  Yeah, no, I'm fine. 
[00:47:30]  Except I'm just, it's like, you know, let's do another show.  Let's entertain somebody else.  Did another comedian just beat the crap out of you or something?  You all right?  No.  Okay.  No.  Once Milton Berle died, both Norton and I moved up a notch.  So that helped.  Yeah.  And then I went back to normal.  You look like a beaten man, though.  I am.  I'm totally.  Literally, I've been on the road.  I've had like two nights off in like five weeks.  And I've been flying around a lot.  And then I don't even think I took.  Did I tell you about the, I'll have to tell you about the experience with Fox TV. 
[00:48:00]  Did I tell you what happened there?  I don't think so.  You're on part of one of those car chases we like to watch.  No, that would have been, then that would have been a series.  Hey, look, it's Louis Black.  They're dragging him out and beating him.  You're going to be part of.  Driving to Norton's house.  You're not going to be part of celebrity boxing, are you?  No, God, no.  Better known as has-been boxing.  Better known as, oh, man.  Did you see it last night?  I would rather watch Phlegm.  I would rather watch.  No, it was great.  Oh, stop.  Come on.  It's fun stuff.  It was great.  Basically, they have taken the celebrity death matches from MTV and made it a reality. 
[00:48:30]  Hopefully, someday, people will die in the ring.  But it was amazing.  Olga Corbett and what's her name?  Darva.  Darva.  I don't want to be famous.  Conger.  Yeah, yeah.  Darva.  I just want to fade back into obscurity.  Conger.  She beat the crap out of an old gymnast.  I mean, it was pathetic.  It was so sad.  Like, she had some moves.  Darva, like, had some moves.  She would get in there. 
[00:49:00]  Straight fists she'd throw right into Olga Corbett's face.  Old beat-up face.  Oh, my God.  Olga Corbett is, no lie, about three foot six now.  She has shrunk.  She never grew.  It was really sad.  It was sad.  It's an older woman just sitting there getting pummeled by Darva Conger.  The manute bowl thing and the fridge.  That was fun to watch because it looked like the fridge was going to drop dead of a heart attack.  At any moment.  Walking out of the corner, he was breathing heavy. 
[00:49:30]  He was done.  He was like, he couldn't even throw any punches.  He stood there.  And manute bowl is just, he scares the crap out of me.  He looks like that.  He's seven foot six.  Remember that thing that came out of the ship at the end of Close Encounters?  He looks like that.  He's like, scary.  He was throwing punches and I thought his arm was going to snap off.  He's got that leg that kind of, the knee bends the wrong way.  Very scary to watch.  But they didn't do anything.  They just stood there and kind of.  Well, they couldn't figure out where to hit each other, Dan. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  I mean, because the fridge was staring at Manute Bowles' junk.  It was that tall.  No, it's not, he was that tall.  Probably should have put a glove on that thing.  I'm sure that's like an anaconda.  He's huge and he was a terrible basketball player.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  He was a good blocker though.  Good shot blocker.  Yeah, well, he's seven foot seven.  I mean, it's like Ray Bubu Mancini is doing some of the announcing, if you want to call  it that.  Man, they should just outlaw boxing.  That guy was articulate at some point in his career.  Remember when a boxer gets out there and he's new on the scene and maybe he does a little 
[00:50:30]  announcing during a match and he sounds good and then years later you see him and boom  and he's just like, well, it's good, the fridge is kind of fat.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  He used to be able to speak.  He's a mess now.  But you also think, you know, I mean, you know, if you're getting people to actually do  this, they might get somebody who can announce it.  Yeah.  You might get somebody who's not.  I don't think he's the only boxing guy they can get. 
[00:51:00]  When he said, Manupola, it's rumored that he once killed a lion with a spear back in  Africa.  It's like, oh, I don't.  First of all, just looking at him, how would you even doubt that?  I take it as fact.  It's Sudan.  I mean, that's what they do instead of Little League.  Yeah.  Go kill a lion with a spear.  Holy ass.  And then looking at him, I think he hid behind the spear stalking the lion.  Anthony, speaking of celebrity boxing, on our phone lines, Horshack.  Ron Polillo.  Hey, Ron.  How are you doing, man?  I'm in the middle of rehearsal.  How are you? 
[00:51:30]  Good.  Are you, have you recovered from your boxing match?  Oh, yeah.  A long time ago.  With Screech.  Man.  What, what did you think at the end of that bout?  You were pretty beat up.  Did you, did you regret going in?  No, I never regretted going in and I didn't want it to end.  Really?  Yeah, I was all set.  I was.  Everyone else wanted it to end, Ron.  Yeah.  I think the thing that happened was my contacts were knocked out of my head.  I saw them peel a contact lens off of your cheek, but that eye was puffing up real bad. 
[00:52:00]  And I have a feeling that that was why they called the match because, well, I mean.  It had nothing to do with all the shots you took to the head, huh?  Well, you see, that was the thing.  We had made a deal and, and the ref had also told me, I don't know whether he told him or not.  Yeah.  But the ref said, no shots to the head.  Really?  Yeah.  And so I did not.  I did not.  And after the first shot, I, I slugged him in the head. 
[00:52:30]  I think he's still puffed drunk.  But, and, and, and that was an absolute reflex response because.  The animal in you came out.  I guess so because Dustin and his manager had called me up and said, please, please, please,  please don't go for the head.  Now, wow, I didn't know that there were conditions like that.  Were they afraid you were going to hurt each other's modeling careers?  Well, uh, he evidently was, uh, doing a standup the next night and, uh, wanted to remain 
[00:53:00]  whole and, uh, I started a rehearsal on, on the show that I'm doing now, Anything Goes,  and I also wanted to remain whole also.  So, um, I had only trained for three days and.  That's it, huh?  And that's all I had was three days and he had been.  Really?  After looking at that body, I thought you were at it for about eight months.  No, three days.  Wow.  Three days.  And, uh, uh, I mean, I, I go to the gym four times a week. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  But, uh, you know, I had never done fisticuffs before in my whole life.  Ron, what, what happened with your eye?  I saw, uh, it was really puffed up.  Um.  We saw it growing on TV.  The Dr. Caney put ice on it.  It went right down.  Oh, it did.  I got a black eye and three days later it was gone.  What was his name?  Pardon me?  Oh, I thought you saw a black guy.  But, I mean, it was such an uneven match from the get-go.  I mean, when they had pitched his name to me.  Yeah.  When they pitched us his name, they said he's a beanpole. 
[00:54:00]  Uh, uh, he doesn't weigh that much more than you.  Wrong.  He weighed 60 pounds more than me.  Yeah.  It did seem like a mismatch.  Ron, I'm thinking they should have teamed you up with Olga.  Well, I thought that they, I wanted them to team me up with Davy Jones.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And they even tried to get him, but, uh.  How old is Davy Jones now?  How old a guy is he?  No, he's not.  I think that he's like, uh, oh, maybe two or three years older than I am.  Yeah.  Well, that probably would have been a fairer match, sure. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, uh, and, and, and the man had, uh, had the wingspan of a freaking pterodactyl.  I mean, I couldn't get, I couldn't get near him.  My, my, my arm stretch is something like 63 inches and his was like 76.  Well, I'll tell you, it was a pretty entertaining fight to watch.  Uh, I like when you, uh, you threw some punches and then turned around so he could hit you  in the back of the head.  Well, the thing that I was really proud of was I felt like, you know, I had never done  anything like this before and I felt like I was the man just walking into the, walking 
[00:55:00]  into the ring with this guy.  Oh, cut me, Mr. Cutter.  Yeah.  You know, and I think that, uh, from all of the phone calls that I've gotten and, uh,  and the response that I've gotten from the press too was that, you know, I was a pretty  brave guy and I, I felt good about it.  I felt real, real good about it.  Very good, Ron.  Well, it was definitely uncomfortable to watch.  Well, uh, you should have been in my shoes. 
[00:55:30]  It was, uh, I was, I was worried for your life there, Ron.  Yeah, I was.  Well, it so didn't hurt.  Really?  Very few people would get in the ring with Dustin Diamond.  Pardon me?  Very few people would get in the ring with Dustin Diamond.  Well, who knew that he had been a, that, that he had been a professional kickboxer since  he was 10 years old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't you do any research there, Ron?  He obviously wasn't taking acting lessons all those years. 
[00:56:00]  Well, he did not disclose that fact.  And, um, I think that that's regrettable.  All right, Ron.  Well, thanks a lot.  Uh, it was a very entertaining match to watch.  Thank you.  I'll give you that.  Thank you.  And, um, it got people to see me in a totally different way, I think.  And for that, I'm eternally grateful.  All right, man.  All right.  Thank you, Ron.  Take care of yourself.  All right, there he is.  Oh, Ron?  Yeah.  You suck, boy.  That's my favorite gag ever. 
[00:56:30]  There he is.  And, um, click.  There he is.  Horshack.  Yeah.  Horshack.  It made me laugh for years growing up.  It's great.  Arnold Horshack.  And then the main, uh, bout there, uh, Joey Buttafuoco in China.  Yeah.  You know, we, we've made fun of China in this show, but, no, you have.  But, uh, man, I'm on her side today, big time.  Really?  He looked like the biggest scumbag in that ring last night.  But he is.  Everyone is faulting Joey.  He tossed her across the ring.  Yeah, he's a dick.  Everybody's talking about him, though, like. 
[00:57:00]  Hitting after the bell.  Like, he was a nice guy going into this.  And all of a sudden, oh, my God, look how Joey's acting.  Yeah, he's not famous for rescuing children.  No.  I mean, what do you expect from Joey Buttafuoco?  You know what, you know, watching the fight last night and seeing him just grab China.  At one point, he grabbed her, had her in a headlock type of thing.  The rep was coming over to break him up.  He just threw her down on the mat and walked away, kind of looking at her.  She looked up shocked, like, what the hell did this guy just do to me?  And all I kept thinking was how Mary Jo Buttafuoco must have looked flying around her apartment 
[00:57:30]  as he just punched her and threw her into walls because you just look at a guy manhandling.  Sprinting out of your lip.  Stop talking out of the side of your face.  You just can't.  You look at somebody doing that to a woman, even in the ring, and you kind of get the impression  that it might not be the first time he's done something like that, you know?  Like, if I was in the ring with a woman, I'd kind of be like, all right, you okay?  Kind of, let me feel this out.  I'll see how hard she hits. 
[00:58:00]  Joey just goes out there grabbing the back of her head like he's getting a hummer from her,  just punching her in the face.  He punched her in the throat twice.  He punched her in the throat.  Yeah.  He's built like Jake LaMotta when he did stand-up.  They couldn't even get that headgear on him because his face was all bloated and fat.  Did he look so cute in that?  You wanted to pinch his little like a Russian boy.  We were watching in the office, and Jimmy looks at Joey Buttafuoco when he goes back  to the corner.  He's got the headgear on, and his face is so fat that he's like, he could be a butcher 
[00:58:30]  at this when you give him a squishy face.  And Jimmy just goes, look how cute he is.  He goes, I just want to pinch his little chubby cheek.  Well, he was supposed to fight Bobbitt, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Bobbitt was arrested because he beat up his wife.  He would have killed Bobbitt.  I met Buttafuoco.  Oh, yeah.  And not just because you can see that picture on eatabullet.com.  That has nothing to do with him.  Oh, my goodness.  He has hands like cement.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Jethro.  Yo.  What's up, Jethro?  Yo, what's up?  I just wanted to make a comment about the fight.  I thought it was funny that...  Which fight are you talking about, Boo-Boo?  Oh, about the one with Buttafuoco and Manupo, whatever.  It's funny that because Manupo said if he won, he was going to donate to charity.  And then if Joey Buttafuoco won, you know he was definitely buying a new train and with T-tops.  Probably.  This Manupo, it's a really sad story.  He was a very rich guy because of the NBA and stuff.  Later.  He gave all his money to the war effort in Sudan.  What an idiot. 
[00:59:30]  That's a good move.  Yeah, great.  Good investment.  And he continues to give all his money to the effort.  Jeez.  The Sudan.  Well, let him.  Why?  Why?  Why not?  Look, the guy was sleeping in dirt.  At least now he has an apartment.  I don't feel bad for him.  He's seven foot six.  He's probably got a mule the size of my leg.  Best thing I read was Manupo looked like a chocolate-covered praying mantis.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say that Joey Buttafuoco is like my hero now. 
[01:00:00]  He was the only one who went in there with any kind of gumption.  Everybody else kind of just stood off and...  Gumption?  Gumption.  Nothing.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I'm going back to my list.  Did he have a little pizzazz?  Josh.  He had spunk.  He had some go-to-it-ness.  Gumption.  You know what sucks about this celebrity boxing, though?  The rounds are only a minute long.  Yeah.  And then they allow him a lot of time to just stand around and do nothing.  So by the time the end of the round comes about, you haven't seen much.  That was great when the referee went up to Manupo and William Refrigerator Perry goes,  if you don't hit each other, you're not getting paid. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  He did say that.  And one other thing I wanted to say, when I heard that Don had polyps in his throat,  I was hoping he was going to pull a spin doctor.  Well, that'll be his next excuse, I guess, that he doesn't have a voice to continue or  something.  I don't know.  All right.  Let's go to Sean.  Sean, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I watched that fight last night with Joey Buttafuoco in China.  I just want to say, the only thing worse than embarrassing yourself is embarrassing yourself 
[01:01:00]  and not knowing it.  That guy is such a scumbag, and he just showed what a man he really was.  Well, that's what I'm saying, though.  That's the type of man he is, and he's never tried to hide it.  Buttafuoco's not the problem.  People miss this.  It's the public making him a celebrity.  He didn't make himself a celebrity.  So, like, oh, look at him.  What a scumbag.  I can't believe he did that.  It's dummies like me who run out.  Cut a picture.  We make him a celebrity.  Yeah, yeah, but Jim. 
[01:01:30]  Not going to work ever, sir.  No.  I'm too good.  I'm too good.  I'm too strong-chinned.  All right.  Oh, my.  The other thing we want to talk about really fast, David Blaine.  Did you see the David Blaine thing, Lewis?  Yeah.  Did I care less?  How ridiculous.  But how silly was it?  He's standing up on that platform for, what, 32 hours?  32 hours.  Seven.  A little over 34 hours.  Yeah.  To overcome his fears.  No.  That's what he said.  There was one big commercial for David Blaine last night.  It was an hour show, and they had nothing.  They had a few of his street tricks, and the rest of the time was him talking about he's 
[01:02:00]  trying to overcome his fears.  Yeah, I think the gag was, I'm going to climb up on this thing and jump off into a bunch  of boxes.  And people went, David, I don't think the network's going to go for that.  He goes, okay, I'll stand up there for like a long time.  Yeah.  37 hours.  What's so hard about just jumping into boxes?  I mean, we've all done that without bags, haven't we?  Good gravy. 
[01:02:30]  I agree with you.  You agree with me.  We hire someone to stand there and go, no, you're not middle-aged and fat.  You're a cut-up.  What, do you brush your teeth with, bong water?  Huff, huff, huff, huff, huff, huff.  Breath smells like the box of a cadaver.  Hello.  Lee.  Stop brushing with a toilet scraper. 
[01:03:00]  Coffee and feces again for breakfast?  That's what the JFK's...  You can't say that.  That's the F word.  Hey, I think the Redskins are going to do it this year.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think so, too. 
[01:03:30]  We're out of time.  Hi, Boo-Boo.  Sugar Bear.  Oh, Sugar Bear.  Hi, sweetie.  Hi, Boo-Boo.  Hey, Mike, what are you doing?  Oh, my God.  Mike just shot himself in the head.  It was tough.  Yeah, I think so, too.  It was all he could take.  I think so, too. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, I think so, too.  Yeah, me, too.  Yeah, I agree.  I agree.  I agree.  Yep, I agree.  Yep, I agree.  Richie, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  David Blaine's next trick, he's going to make Donna Mike try to be funny.  All right.  Oh, boy.  He's a magician, not a miracle worker.  That trick last night was ridiculous.  I can see where this show is headed.  Wow.  Yeah, I can see, too.  I agree.  I agree.  I agree.  Hey, Boo-Boo.  Yuck.  Oh, let's go to Pete. 
[01:04:30]  Pete, what's up?  Oh, man.  Pete?  Pete, you there?  I don't know where he went.  Oh, well.  He's gone.  That was boring fans calling in.  You know, you guys, you're not good.  Oh, cutting edge.  Jesus Christ.  Have some gumption to quote that guy that just got that.  Hey, Pete, what's up?  Stop with the gumption.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  You, talk.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's your name?  Steve.  Steve.  Sorry.  Yeah, I stood on top of my radio for 35 hours to get over my fear of Donna Mike. 
[01:05:00]  What did you do, jump in a toothpaste?  Just in a pile of razor blades, because I felt better.  Oh, my.  My stars.  Oh, boy.  I'll say.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, me too.  Little fat white guy's suburban laugh.  Shuckle.  Shortle.  Little shortle.  Never a belly laugh to be found. 
[01:05:30]  I love when you're in so we can hide behind you.  Yeah, just hiding.  That's great.  Oh, good gosh.  What were we talking about?  Oh, David Blaine.  That's what I'm saying.  I can see where this is headed today.  Oh, Louis Black's in the studio.  That's right.  Almost forgot.  Oh, sugar bear.  Remember that time you forgot to clean up the family den?  Ho, ho, ho.  Yeah, you really read me the riot act. 
[01:06:00]  Ho, ho, ho.  Ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock.  And then you remember that time?  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  I didn't put my dish in the sink.  Ho, ho, ho.  Ho, ho, boo, boo.  Ho, ho.  Twenty-five-year-old men are really enjoying listening to that.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, anyway, yeah, ho, that David Blaine.  Wow.  Whoa.  Yeah, ho.  Wow.  And he acted like he was dazed and confused after he hit the boxes. 
[01:06:30]  I didn't even watch.  As they're trying to dig, you know, dig him out of them.  Didn't even watch it.  Was it as hammy as when he, on Carson Daly's show, he pulled his own heart out?  Did you see that one?  Yeah.  Louis, you see this?  No, I didn't see it.  He opens his shirt.  I can't watch Carson Daly.  He opens his shirt.  Makes me suicidal.  And starts digging at his chest and then sticks his hand in his chest.  And the audience is, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, like he's really doing this. 
[01:07:00]  And pulls out his own heart that he then holds up and then collapses on the stage.  And everyone goes, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  You see the face Carson was making?  He was so concerned.  Was he selling that or was he acting?  What was he doing?  He was selling it, yes.  He was looking very confused.  Should he go over?  And then somebody came over to David Blaine, laid down and put their hand on his shoulder  and started, like, trying to see if he was okay.  What a cheesy douche.  Yeah.  Well, the other thing is that Carson's concern wasn't concerned. 
[01:07:30]  They hadn't written his reaction on the paper.  So he just froze.  So he completely, he was, what do I do now?  What am I supposed to do now?  That look of confusion.  How did he become an interviewer?  I, who would not want to interview people because I can't pay attention for more than eight seconds to somebody.  Yes.  How the hell does he?  He, he's unmitigated.  You sit there, are you serious?  Is he really?  What, what is it?  Is he that cute? 
[01:08:00]  Uh, yes.  Can't you have somebody, if you're going to have somebody interview somebody, can't you have a beginning?  You ask a question, you listen, you listen to the answer, and then your brain responds as opposed to, oh, yeah.  Wow.  Um, I, it's like, it's like, and I, I take sugar in my coffee, too.  The girls like him.  And you can listen for more than .8 seconds.  Well, thanks.  Well, to you, and only to you.  The girls like him, though.  He's, uh, one of the, uh, you know, he's like a heartthrob. 
[01:08:30]  What, a penis with eyes?  Well, the girls kind of like his hairdo.  The girls dig him.  I know, the girls dig him.  What?  On the basis of what?  Well, he likes, uh, to, you know, jump on skateboards and stuff.  Yeah.  T.R.L.  Oh, we'll request Lewis.  Bunch of teenagers calling up to talk about politics.  I thought I'd turn into.  You're dumb.  I wish I could do a Lewis Black impression. 
[01:09:00]  That would have been very funny, but I can't.  Lewis, I have an anorexia.  Eat a sandwich.  Are you insane?  People are starving.  Joe, what's up?  Oh, my.  Hey, Joe.  That was the cheesiest trick, man.  Anybody with no job can practice staying awake for three days.  The rest of us have to go to work, you know?  Oh, the David Blaine thing?  Yeah.  It was really embarrassing to watch.  I think anyone can stand for 36 hours.  Look, if there were homeless in the boxes, it would have made it interesting.  Oh, yes.  Right.  Then you've got something. 
[01:09:30]  Hitting those boxes was, you know, a piece of cake.  Yeah, but I'm the quad, man.  Mine was born.  All right.  All right.  We're out of here soon.  Head down to the bowling alley.  Hey, careful.  That one might go in the...  Oh!  You made a strike!  Which one of the two listeners that showed up would like to roll the ball next? 
[01:10:00]  Hey!  Hey!  You made a...  A split!  Ha, ha, ha!  Ooh!  Ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha!  My father doesn't even bowl.  Bowling stinks. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, man.  And now the calls will come in.  It's awful.  You don't have an event where people show up to roll a ball.  You have chicks taking their shirts off.  That's...  Ha, ha, ha!  It's okay.  People show up next time.  It's okay.  Ha, ha, ha!  Ooh.  Ooh.  Look, the boo-boos are playing. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And they could hire someone to stand there with that microphone and just laugh over.  Ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha!  We're going to stop.  We'll replace you with Suzanne Somers.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Bring her in.  Yup, yup.  I agree.  I agree.  Yup, yup, yup.  I agree.  Oh, wow.  Oh, I think so, too.  You're so full of gumption today, Jimmy.  Little Jimmy. 
[01:11:30]  Wow.  Stick to it-ness.  It's awful.  Gumption.  All right.  Lewis Black in this studio.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Lewis, you picked a great day to come by, man.  It's perfect.  A lot of people checking out this show today.  Yeah.  Uh, Lewis is playing June 14th at Town Hall.  Tickets on sale now.  Who's warming up for you?  Anybody?  Eddie Broe.  Eddie.  Eddie Broe.  Very funny.  And, uh, Zach Galifianakis.  Patrick Ruah!  Oh, yeah.  Patrick Ruah.  That's a funny guy.  He does the Canadian name bit. 
[01:12:00]  I like it.  Nice.  All right.  Uh, Shondra Levy.  Want to talk about that next a little bit?  Yeah.  I would like to talk about that, because, uh...  Dan has a couple observations that he has.  Some observations.  I'd love to be able to chuckle him to the table.  I'd also like to talk...  His observations are going to be a little different than your observations, Lewis.  Yeah.  Um, well, when has it never been the case?  I know.  We never see eye to eye.  You're not even going to be able to figure this one out.  We ought to have a point-counterpoint show.  We should.  No.  Lewis will go, I don't agree with you.  It doesn't...  No.  Oh, maybe that didn't get on. 
[01:12:30]  I'd say, F you, Lewis.  Have a good show.  He says something, and you agree.  And then some broad calls in, and everyone just looks down like they're remembering child  good rape episodes.  Don't make eye contact, and maybe it'll be over soon.  Oh, my stars.  Oh, man.  Remember that time you didn't put your stuff back in the fridge?  Oh!  I sure do, sweetums.  Stop, Jim.  I can't force out another laugh. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, my.  Awful.  So we got that to look forward to.  Excellent.  Opie and Anthony.  How are my little pigs today?  Do I have to drive the bus?  Can I ride on the bus?  Where's the bus?  The thing with the young girl is, I think we're going to have to...  Well, I'll go to court with you.  She's not 18.  She's not 18.  It's a mockery.  There's no tea.  Do I have to drive the bus?  Can I ride on the bus? 
[01:13:30]  Where's the bus?  How are my little pigs today?  We use you for good radio.  We're not your friends.  Unbelievable.  Oh, my Lord.  Shoot me now.  The thing with the young girl is, I think we're going to have to...  Well, I'll go to court with you.  I don't know which one's which.  Opie, Anthony.  Do I have to drive the bus?  Can I ride on the bus?  Where's the bus?  Lewis Black.  He's probably at home listening going,  They're doing it all wrong.  Opie.  How are my little pigs today?  And Anthony. 
[01:14:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  1027.  WNEW.  They say I'm cocky.  And I say what it ain't bragging.  If you do it, then you back it up.  They say I'm cocky.  And I say what it ain't bragging.  If you do it, then you back it up.  Cocky.  And I say what it ain't bragging.  If you do it, then you back it up.  They say I'm cocky.  And I say what it ain't bragging.  If you do it, then you back it up.  And we back it up.  Back from the O.P. and Anthony show, Lewis Black in the studio. 
[01:14:30]  The radio edit there, huh?  Yeah, I know.  A little radio edit.  Mother effer.  I like that version.  Lewis Black playing Town Hall, June 14th.  Chandra Levy is dead.  Well, I think that was apparent.  She's dead.  She's dead.  They found her remains in Rock Creek Park.  I know Rock Creek Park.  I'm from that area. 
[01:15:00]  You are, are you?  Yeah, I used to play.  It's where you'd go run around in Rock Creek Park.  I like the fact that they had police dogs searching that whole area for how long?  For months and months and months and months.  And nothing.  Some guy's walking his dog, and the dog kind of pulls him over to that,  sniffs around and starts digging, and finds her.  Plus, they knew.  That's what's next, too.  They knew this.  I didn't, I mean, until they, you know, they knew that she was going over there.  Yeah.  So wouldn't that be the primary search area? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, but she was buried, my friends.  Yeah, she was.  And the dog dug up a little.  I think a little coyote or a bear or a dog, something dug that up.  She was in a shallow grave.  She was in a shallow grave somewhere.  A bear in D.C.  A bear.  A bear.  A bear being in the District of Columbus.  There's got to be one.  One bear.  One left.  Wandering around.  Wandering around.  Wandering around.  Looking for some food.  Come on.  They have all kinds of...  A little lost.  Very hard to find clues.  Looking for his pal, Boo Boo.  Very hard to find clues at this point, because she was so decomposed, she was nothing more 
[01:16:00]  than a skeleton.  They did find a Walkman on her ears, and it's assumed that she was listening to Don and Mike  and died of boredom there in D.C.  Thank God her tape thing was on record, and all they heard was this.  Hi, Boo Boo.  Hi, Boo Boo.  Hi, Boo Boo.  Hi, Boo Boo.  Hi, Boo Boo. 
[01:16:30]  Yes.  The official cause of death.  Bored dead.  I was...  Now I'm re-fascinated with the story.  Remember when she disappeared?  Everyone was fascinated with it.  Then we had that other big story, and now it seems people are so willing to just forget  about that one, and we're getting back to things like David Blaine on a pole, and she  Jandra Levy, and she came back like, you know, the bitch wasn't satisfied with a little 
[01:17:00]  fame that she had for those few minutes.  Yeah.  You know, like Darva, she has to come back now because she was out of the news for a while.  And the cops can't find her, and who finds her?  Some schlub was out looking for a turtle.  Oh, was he turtle hunting?  He was looking for turtles in the park.  What a zilch.  Imagine thinking it's a shell, and you just pick up the top of her skull.  Oh, it's a little head.  What is that there?  I thought it was a big albino turtle.  I always get a little too deep into these things. 
[01:17:30]  I start thinking, and it's a kind of sort of macabre, the way I think about this.  But knowing that she was dead, and she was laying there in those woods for so long, all  I kept thinking was, when, at what point, at what point during the time that our parents  were pleading for her to at least call and say she was okay, or pleading with some captor,  or some hint that would let them know where her little girl was, at what point during that 
[01:18:00]  time did that jawbone just go, and fall open as the remaining connective tissue was gnawed  away by a bug?  You know, when they find their skeletons, and that jaw is just eerily hanging open, like  an Indiana Jones moment.  When was it, okay, short, and then just, there had to be a moment, a day, a minute, where  it just went, and opened up. 
[01:18:30]  Was it when they were saying, please, Chandra, call us, call us, and open it up.  Wow.  I never, I never want to hear about, I don't ever want to hear about your family life.  When did what, when did what was earlier during her livelihood, her pubie mound, when did  that make contact with her tailbone, just from, they had to make contact at some point,  during the rot phase. 
[01:19:00]  I needed an asthma inhaler.  When did that mouth that got her the internship to begin with just pop open?  You think about horrific things like that.  Don't tell me you never thought about a friend that had passed on, and how they must look  each day rotting in their coffin.  Oh my goodness!  You never think about that?  No.  I think about that creepy stuff, because no matter how deep you bury them, they're there.  It's creepy.  They're somewhere in space and time. 
[01:19:30]  And she was laying out there in the open.  One day, maybe a little coyote came along and gave a nibble on a toe.  Or a raccoon or something.  Coyotes in Washington, you guys gotta go to D.C.  There's got, we've been there.  There's no coyotes in Washington.  We were just there two weeks ago.  Two weeks ago.  There were no coyotes.  Hundreds of rabid fans outside.  Oh, no, now it's being reported that JFK had to pay those people to be there.  Oh, is that it?  No, it's not.  I swear to God.  It's not.  I swear to you.  I don't know.  It's now being reported that JFK hired people to be in the, uh... 
[01:20:00]  Who said that?  In the parking lot.  Who?  Oh, come on.  Who said that?  Some fans of another show.  No, they didn't.  I swear to you.  That's ridiculous.  They were paid.  Yeah, right.  Okay, you're right.  They were paid.  You guys in that one, too.  And the girl that drank out of my mule was paid, and actually she was.  Hey, guys, want to go turtle hunting?  Oh, little turtle.  Oh, look.  Hold on.  It has disturbed Dawn.  What's the problem?  Dawn, what's up?  You are out of your mind.  I can't believe you think of those sick things like that. 
[01:20:30]  I think of these horrific, like, images like that.  Oh, my God.  My stomach is so upset.  I want to vomit on myself.  Like, whenever somebody you know, whenever they die, like, you know, when my, let's say  my grandfather, when he died, all I thought about for, like, months and months on end was,  all right, what phase of the rot is he in now?  Are the gaunt cheeks stretching the skin over the bone?  What horrible movie did you watch that argued for you to think of? 
[01:21:00]  Had the eyeball.  Things like Creepshow.  It horrified me.  How many times did you whack your back thinking of that?  Just cranking.  Oh, my God.  Just cranking.  Yeah, you rot.  You rot, Grandpa.  Oh, you just rot away.  Notice how I was really doing the jerk motion.  Bouncing?  I'm bouncing.  I'm thinking of rotting Grandpa, and I'm cranking.  Okay, I got to hang up.  You're making me more sick.  No.  You never thought of what happens like that?  Stop it.  You're lying.  No. 
[01:21:30]  I always thought of the images that you get in your head of what happens at that point.  When they find a body.  You don't think, you don't think, what's his face in there?  No, no, no.  Who's John Walsh from America's Most Wanted?  Adam Walsh's son.  You don't think he thought at some point where his little boy's head was?  Holy ass.  What's wrong with you today?  You think of things like this when death and bodies are involved.  Yeah, sometimes you do.  Like, you wonder exactly at what point did the fat guys realize, wow, we are never even getting a one. 
[01:22:00]  When did that happen?  You do wonder when something is dying slowly and horribly.  Right, and just rotting away.  Yeah, who carried off the first eyeball?  Who walked off with it?  Was it a raccoon?  Was it a big colony of ants going, oh, it's a big round cricket?  Because they don't know better.  They're stupid ants, Lewis.  And they're like, thud, thud, trying to bang it into the hole. 
[01:22:30]  But it ain't big enough.  The hole ain't big enough.  I just got to go.  Now, when, at what point in the childhood did this, I'm serious, did you start to fix it?  I think.  Nobody.  I have never, ever.  I have seriously ever heard anyone.  No one has even.  You have crossed the territory.  You've moved into a place.  I'll be honest with you.  I think I know when it was.  I had a cat, a little brown cat named Smokey, Lewis.  I bet you.  He was named Smokey.  Don't tell the Smoky story.  Lewis, you don't want to hear that. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, a guy with a heart.  He was the cutest little brown, long-haired cat named Smokey.  Meow, meow, meow.  Little Smokey.  And one day, Smokey wasn't home.  I came home from school.  I'm like, Smokey, Smokey, Smokey, and no Smokey.  So, I asked Mom, where's Smokey?  Dad, no one knows where Smokey is.  Days go by, and I'm really freaking out.  And my father told me that Smokey had ran off, and Smokey's in a better place, I guess. 
[01:23:30]  He had seen, like, where Smokey was, but for some reason couldn't get it.  The story's a little shaky in my head.  Yes?  Yeah.  It turned out, as I was walking home from school one day, taking the usual way, but  I crossed the street by the woods, and in the corn, in the gutter, just off the road.  No! 
[01:24:00]  I saw something, Lewis.  I saw something brown.  And as I went toward it, I saw it was an animal.  And the closer I got, and as that smell of rotting animal, for the midday show here at  NEW, could tell you something has died.  And it is truly rotting.  And as I walked up, I saw, oh my God, it's Smokey.  And, uh, I took a stick, and I went to flip Smokey over.  No.  You see the other side of Smokey? 
[01:24:30]  No!  I didn't know I'm a kid.  And Smokey was flat on that one side, with his flesh eaten away to the rib cage, and maggots  crawling all over my little Smokey.  Shut up!  And all I could think of, for nights and nights and nights on end, was how long Smokey  laid there as a recognizable Smokey, and when that side became flat, and how long it took 
[01:25:00]  for the maggots to eat the flesh away to expose the ribs.  And then, ever since that point, I've always thought that, whenever death is involved, that,  you know, what's the decaying process, and what point are they at right now?  Well, is that scaring you, Lewis?  I can't breathe.  Did you kneel down and cry and shake him like Ricky Schroeder and say, wake up, champ!  Wake up, champ!  Did Jack Morton cry while you're petting Smokey for the last time?  No, it wasn't like that. 
[01:25:30]  I was kind of scared to tug.  That's why I used the stick.  And he got tussled his little head for the last time.  Karen, what's up?  Well, I was going to call and say hi to Lewis Black, but now all I can think of is my older  brother who passed away ten years ago.  Oh, no!  Did you ever think about it, Karen?  Look what you did today.  Yeah, I did.  In fact, I asked the funeral director what was going to happen to him.  See, you sick bitch.  No, no, no.  I'm not.  I was worried about what happens after, you know?  No, no!  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  I always picture things, too, because, you know, there were years ago...  She's like, why don't we...  We should be doing an ad for cremations.  There was a very lovely young girl that died well before she should have.  Oh, dear.  He's, like, got a cat.  And whenever I think about a situation like that, you just picture, like, how if a child, 
[01:26:30]  a young child has died, they dress him in the cute little dresses and whatnot, and then  you just picture this skeleton with the dry skin and the clumps of hair falling out, like,  here, but the dress is still all pretty.  What is wrong with you today?  You lost even me today.  You know what?  That's not possible.  Trust me.  He lost me.  He lost me.  It's sick.  I know, but...  You lost me with that.  It's just something...  Hey, I also think of quantum physics.  I think of a lot of everything.  Lois, stop laughing. 
[01:27:00]  You know what?  I remember that thong is hugging her tailbone.  Oh, God.  One sexy thong is just crumpled with bones in it.  See, yeah.  You've got to think there's a skeleton wearing a thong.  There's a bra with nothing in it.  The bra...  Karen.  ...just on those blades, shoulder blades.  You guys aren't making me feel better.  Karen, help me here.  Help me.  Sure.  What do you got?  Anything else?  Well...  The front release clip laying on the sternum.  All right.  Stop!  Just let me say hello to Lois and ask him to talk. 
[01:27:30]  Let me say hello to Lois.  It's going to lay right perfectly centered.  It's going to be off to the side.  Sometime during the assault or burial, you know, it's shifted a little, so now it will  be like that forever and ever.  Until they find him turtle hunting.  Forever and ever.  Little tag from the thong.  Just tickling in the cockies.  The cockies.  Little bony white feet sticking out from those jogging speakers.  Just jogging to stay healthy.  How ironic.  See, Norton understands me. 
[01:28:00]  I am with Lois on this one.  All right, it's a little dark, but I'm sitting right between them.  We all have our dark moments.  Now I'm going to have dreams.  Stephanie!  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I think we need to hear a little Kill a Kitten for your tribute to Smokey.  Smokey!  Yes!  All right, we'll do that.  Awesome, thanks.  Thank you.  See you.  No one understands me.  Let me, uh, let's go to Lois.  Hey, Lois, what's up?  Lois! 
[01:28:30]  The Lois.  Lois?  Something's wrong with the phone today.  Oh, well.  One more try here.  Lois!  Well, people are careening off the road in the middle of some of these discussions.  You know, I cannot believe...  Lois?  The fact that you can get this up your chest is what's...  There's almost a sign of health to it.  But the fact that you...  Almost?  No, I'm serious.  But the fact that you share it is wrong.  Being able to speak about it is great, but you're supposed to do this in some sort of professional  atmosphere.  I know, but I, you know...  It's...  Lois? 
[01:29:00]  I never really thought about it.  Hey, Lois, I'm sorry.  I stepped away from the phone for a second.  We don't have time for that!  Hey, Ant, I think you're old enough to hear this now.  I mean, you've matured.  You've become successful.  The last word Smokey heard before he killed himself was...  Hey, Booboo.  Hey, Booboo.  Come here, Booboo.  Hey, Booboo.  Booboo.  Shut up.  Talking about Smokey like that.  Rockhole.  Why is Rockhole calling?  Hey, Rockhole!  Hey!  What's going on?  Your name is Greg? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, that's awesome.  That is so funny.  You got him there, Rockhole.  You got him good that time.  You got me.  Welcome to the club.  And if I've learned anything, it's that calling into this show doesn't help boost your rating.  It stinks.  I just get destroyed by some lesion-headed comic. 
[01:30:00]  Come on, Rockhole.  And you, too.  Come on.  Be nice, Rockhole.  I am being nice.  What are you doing on your show today?  My show today?  Well, basically, I'm just listening to you guys.  And we just got done talking about David Blaine.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I actually heard a bit that we got to talk about this maybe a little later.  Heard a bit, and then I searched the web because the bit sounded familiar, and I found  a recording of the exact same bit that Rockhole did.  Which one?  Done better. 
[01:30:30]  I'm not going to say it because I want to play it at some point.  Oh, all right.  Cool.  But it had been done two years ago word for word, and the acting in his version is so bad.  Really funny.  Good job, Rockhole.  Thanks.  All right, man.  All right, dude.  Later, Greg.  Rockhole's getting a kick out of your M.A.  Dean, what's up?  All right, Frank.  Hey, Dean.  I tell you, I thought that yesterday was the worst I could possibly hear in cringe radio  with Steve the Whistler. 
[01:31:00]  And, you know, it was bad because he was in the studio.  I thought when you guys tooled on Mr. DVD, that was pretty bad.  But today takes the cake, man.  By far.  All right, Dean.  Very good.  Dean from D.C.  Look, we have a listener in D.C.  Yeah.  Thank you, Dean.  Take care, boys.  All right.  Peace.  I had to pay people to stand outside.  Hey, you ever think of celebrities like that, too?  Because sometimes that happens.  No, I don't like thinking that way.  Well, nobody does.  It's hard enough getting across the street than thinking, oh, as I'm looking at somebody, 
[01:31:30]  boy, I wonder what they're going to like when a bulldozer hits them and their head  explodes like a ripe melon.  And, oh, boy, I'm watching the little worms eat the brain.  I don't think that way.  Like, you know, when Lane Staley was in the house for a while.  There's a door in your head and you shut it.  No.  Yes.  I like opening those doors.  You put a couple of bulldogs in front and when the door tries to stop you, you go,  and you stop it.  I just want to know, at Lane Staley's house, like, you know, at some point, because there 
[01:32:00]  was quite a few days that had gone by, there was some point during all of those days where  there was that slight light blue light at about four in the morning that you get five in the  morning coming through the window where you could just see him laying there rotting as  the birds are going.  That's funny.  And I'm like, that was a change.  And like the next day, the same thing.  And all day, he's just laying there, not moving.  The sun high in the sky. 
[01:32:30]  It's midday.  Maybe outside you hear.  With his eyes open.  Yeah.  The cars are going by.  Maybe he can hear kids playing way far away.  And then nighttime comes along.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  The owl of the Pacific Northwest.  Hoo, hoo.  And then again, all night long.  Maybe it's pitch black.  Pitch blackness.  But he's still there.  And then blue again.  Off it.  Free bowl of soup.  See?  It's kind of horrific when you think in those terms, isn't it?  Hey, we're going to take a break. 
[01:33:00]  Lewis Blank in studio.  All righty.  He's playing town hall June 14th.  What a fun show.  It's tremendous.  Yeah, I better take a break.  I agree with that.  What pissed you off today, my friend?  It's just part of the dark doors.  Like he says, you're supposed to leave those doors shut.  Sometimes it gets jammed open a little.  Here's a song for Smokey there.  A little Smokey.  I'll do this one for all the animal lovers since they like gerbils so much.  Uh-oh.  It's a sing-along, too. 
[01:33:30]  So everybody, feel free to join in.  Follow the Bucs and Bulls.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting, it helps a lot if you kill a kitten.  Mark my words, cause from where I'm sitting, you can't go wrong if you kill a kitten. 
[01:34:00]  Look at those bones.  There's no crime that you'll be committing.  I know the law, you can, everybody, kill a kitten.  And if you need yarn for that scarf you're knitting, you'll get plenty when you kill a kitten. 
[01:34:30]  Feed it turpentine or break its spine.  Crush it with your shoe, as long as you kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Listen up.  If the one you love isn't quite as smitten, 
[01:35:00]  She'll like you better when you kill a kitten.  And I'll quote the Bible, cause that's where it's written.  If he loveth Jesus, he must kill a kitten.  Throw him at a train, make him snort cocaine.  Drown him in a lake, bake a kitty cake. 
[01:35:30]  Flush him down the can, hit him with your van.  Stick some tea and tea, up his cat bootie.  And do what you must do, as long as you kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Meow.  Kill a kitten.  She's got to kill a kitten. 
[01:36:00]  I do.  All right.  Killing kittens isn't easy.  And if a thought makes you feel queasy, grab a pitchfork from the shed.  And kill a puppy dog instead.  Kill a kitten. 
[01:36:30]  Kill a kitten.  You got to kill a kitten.  A little furry kitten.  You got to kill a kitten.  You got to kill a mother.  You got to kill a son of a...  Kill a little f***ing daddy.  Kill him in a...  To 8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  To 8-6-7-5-3-0-9. 
[01:37:00]  Steven Lynch, everyone.  The Opie and Anthony F. Uline is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  2-1-2-8-3-0-3-7-8-5.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming June 1st, the Opie and Anthony Celebrity Softball Game.  Get details on WNEW.com.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7-WNEW. 
[01:37:30]  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Full house today, man.  Louis Black in studio, playing Town Hall June 14th, here in New York City.  Jim Norton in studio.  Dancing.  Rich Voss is hanging around somewhere.  With a ridiculous hat.  We got a girl outside that wants to try out to be a cheerleader for the Celebrity Slash Bikini Softball Game. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, nice, nice.  Voss, we didn't need material today.  What are you doing?  I got my little summer gear on.  Hey, Whitey, where'd you get that hat?  Can we get a picture of Voss and his hat?  It's awful.  Can we try the stinky cam, or can we take some snapshots and put them up on foundrymusic.com?  There's nothing wrong with my hat.  You're not 75.  My act, my act is. 
[01:38:30]  Wow, self-deprecating humor.  That's all right.  There you go.  You guys do.  Looks like you should be rolling cigars somewhere.  Playing dominoes, you PR, that's awful.  I just wanted to make Rick feel at home.  Driving a car to California with Fred and Ethel in the back seat.  California, here I come.  Right back where I started from.  Yeah, I agree.  I don't like the hat either. 
[01:39:00]  You know, Rick.  My, my.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  That's not a bad hat, Sugar Bear.  I think it is.  Yeah.  Nice.  Did it come with a burro?  A burro?  Come with a burro.  What is it?  What's a burro?  What's a burro?  Oh, he's doing my hands.  It's a burro.  He's doing my hands.  A burro.  A burro.  In Vaudiaville, we rode the burros.  A burro.  A burro.  All right, Rick. 
[01:39:30]  It's fun here.  Hey, you guys.  We've got to say hi to CeCe DeVille, man.  Oh, look at that.  CeCe DeVille.  CeCe.  What's up, man?  Hello.  Hey, hey.  Hello.  There he is.  What's up, CeCe?  It's Cecil here.  What?  It's Cecil here.  Are you okay, CeCe?  Oh, Cecil, you don't even know what's going on with me.  I'm getting ready to do the interview, and I'm listening to your commercial, and you're  saluting the toilet paper replacement man for your Bud Light thing, and I'm saying to 
[01:40:00]  myself, where were you in Mobile, Alabama two nights ago?  Same thing happened to me.  I'm between songs.  There's a drum solo.  I said, oh, my God.  Nature calls.  I've got to go run to the toilet, go do my business, look up, and just as luck would  have it, there's no toilet paper.  So I had to finish the show with no socks on, but I'll tell you, it was a nightmare. 
[01:40:30]  Anyway, Anthony, we've got a cheerleader outside.  Oh, she is hot.  How come you didn't tell them when we took Screech to look at rats?  I didn't think about it.  I'm sorry.  Oh, there's a girl outside that wants to try out to be a cheerleader for our softball  game sponsored by Coors Light.  The game's a week from Saturday, Anthony.  That was an exclusive interview right there.  That was good.  That was unbelievable.  Although the sock line did deserve a little more.  Yeah.  That wasn't a bad, yeah, I had to use the bathroom, and then I went and did the rest of the show 
[01:41:00]  without socks.  That wasn't that bad.  Yeah.  All right.  What was that?  Uh-oh, breaking news.  Hold on, breaking news.  Mike, yes.  You got breaking news?  What's up?  We got a special report.  Something horrifying was that with Sandra Levy's body in the forest.  What was that?  It was boss's career.  Oh.  That's not right.  Oh, boy.  Please.  Sandra Levy's only been dead for a year.  Oh, man.  Oh, you know what?  That was great. 
[01:41:30]  I love you, you little hands fella.  That's what's good.  My hands fit perfectly on your chin.  Do we have a baseball bat?  I want to see how he holds a bat.  I was saying, I want you to catch me.  I want to see how you hold a bat before I draft you.  I'm telling you, man.  Get that.  Oh, no.  You don't want to touch that.  No, you don't want to touch that bat.  That would get close to the ball, and the ball would just fall.  That bat that's...  That really was an awful line.  That stunk.  No, no.  Don't let me get away with it.  That stunk.  All right. 
[01:42:00]  It stunk.  Ugh.  The plastic bat that's up there that's been retired for five years' worth of delegation.  You're not allowed to use that anymore?  Well, all right.  Let's talk to CeCe DeVille.  Oh, look at who's here.  CeCe.  CeCe.  Hello.  CeCe DeVille.  Hello.  How are you?  Very good.  How are you doing, man?  What happened?  I got cut off.  No, we hung up on you.  Oh, you hung up on me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We didn't really...  Then we figured we'd start it over again.  We figured we would do take two for you. 
[01:42:30]  Okay, good.  We'll just make believe that didn't happen, and we'll start the interview.  Okay.  Where are you, CeCe?  Oh, I'm...  We're on our way to Florida on a tour bus.  Oh.  But my signal needle to say sucks.  Yeah.  So, um, bear with me if I cut in or cut out.  No, that's...  The phone's not the problem.  I can hardly even hear you.  Really?  We're right here, CeCe.  Okay.  Uh, Anthony...  It's the funniest thing.  It's the funniest thing. 
[01:43:00]  It's because from my mouth to my ear is five inches, and sometimes it's the furthest distance away.  Uh-oh.  CeCe, you have...  Yeah, hey, CeCe.  Yeah.  You have nothing, do you?  How you doing, O.B.?  All right.  We're doing okay, CeCe.  All right.  Anyway, so we got these two shows coming up.  I'm a huge fan of Poison.  Anthony, I can't stand you.  Oh, well, I wouldn't say that, O.B.  I said I'm not a big fan.  No, you said can't stand, actually.  Did I?  Yeah.  No, I can't believe that.  Well, I gotta be honest with you, I can't stand me either. 
[01:43:30]  But I have no choice.  No, he...  He likes you as a person.  He just doesn't like the Poison type of music.  I wasn't really into the Poison.  I was...  I dig the Poison.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I wasn't really into it, CeCe.  I never had a problem with Poison, and they have a huge comeback happening right now.  I had a problem with the androgynous thing.  I always thought that I liked my music hard and my rock stars to look hard, especially 
[01:44:00]  in tight pants.  But, you know, it's been a good, you know, rocky road for us, so we're doing the best  we can.  Yeah, but...  playing Tuesday, July 9th at Jones Beach at Sunday, July 14th at PNC.  Wow.  Other than that, I am not doing anything.  I'm waiting for those shows to come here and...  Yeah.  And you guys got a new album out called Holly Weird.  Yes.  Oh, really?  A new album.  Well, they do a version of Squeezebox. 
[01:44:30]  That's not too bad at all.  Do they?  Yeah.  I like it.  Who are you touring with, Angel Eyes?  Oh, God.  I am touring with...  It's a big hair extravaganza.  This is a bouffant to defy bouffant.  It's us, Cinderella, Winger...  Oh, I really hate Cinderella.  And the new band that actually sounds more like Nazi Sinatra than Faster Pussycat, but  it's Faster Pussycat, but they have this new Marilyn Manson type SS Stormtrooper regalia. 
[01:45:00]  Interesting.  Yes, yes.  What type of music now are you guys doing with the new Poison album?  Oh, it's the same stuff.  I haven't heard of it.  Really, yeah?  I can't even do the old stuff any good.  So I'm not even about to change it, you know?  I'm just doing the same stuff I used to do, only, you know...  How long has the T-Cell Dropping Tour been in action?  How long has our tour been going?  Two weeks.  We started in Triple O, where we saw the birthplace of Elvis. 
[01:45:30]  We play a little piece of one of the tunes, Opie.  I want to hear what the new...  Give him the CD.  You want to hear...  Oh, here you are, Flower.  You want to hear Squeezebox?  Yeah, let me hear something of that.  Put on the Emperor's new clothes.  It's about me.  I'm playing Squeezebox.  All right, play Squeezebox.  Like I said, play Squeezebox.  Let's hear it with the...  Is it like the Cruise cover of Smoking in the Boys' Room?  No, it's...  All right, let's listen.  I don't know what it's like.  It's a little different. 
[01:46:00]  All right, hold on.  Let's give a little listen and see if the new Poison sounds a lot like the old Poison.  All right, here it is.  Yeah.  Poison off Holly Weird.  It's Squeezebox, and we got Cece DeVille on the phone.  All right, I like it.  Very good, man.  Hey!  I want to hear some vocals.  Oh, you want to hear that part?  Don't even...  Don't even worry about the vocals.  Why?  Just listen to the music.  It's all about the guitar, Anthony.  I want to hear some vocals.  All right. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We take you now via satellite to Peter Sounds its house. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  That girl is tucking their pants into their socks all over the country.  Hey, Cece.  Yes.  How do the chicks look these days out there? 
[01:47:30]  Oh, God.  Well, you know, I mean, they're a little bit older.  We joke about that.  But they like wearing the same stuff, don't they?  They're wearing the same exact stuff, but it sags a little bit, you know?  But then again, I sag a little bit, too, man, because of what I mean, God.  I hear you.  Are you banging the girls on the road now, or what?  Oh, yeah.  A little bit.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, right now, you know, we used to have the condom machine.  Now, we have a Viagra dispenser.  Hey.  Good night, everybody.  Hey.  We're getting a little bit older.  Try the veal. 
[01:48:00]  Huh?  Wow, really?  All right.  Yeah.  Well, the new poison kind of sounds like the old poison.  What?  I kind of like the new poison a little better than the old poison.  Oh, well, good.  Well, I don't know if there's that much of a difference, but whatever it takes for you  guys to buy a copy of the record, or at least one of your listeners to buy at least  one copy.  Let me take a look.  So at least I can put my kid through oral surgery.  All right, let me take a look at that, Opie.  High five.  When are you guys going to be performing in New York? 
[01:48:30]  When are we coming to New York?  Yes.  Yeah.  July 9th is Joan Peach.  All right.  And then July 14th is the PNC Art Center.  Ah, yes.  Isn't it funny that for some reason they don't want us to play Madison Square Garden?  I don't get it.  I figured you could do two or three nights at the Garden, you know?  Yeah.  And then somebody told me I was terribly mistaken.  Did you try the Olive Garden?  I can say that. 
[01:49:00]  I have a little comedy routine that would probably go over good at the Olive Garden, but that  was good.  Let me see that, Opie.  I want to see their pictures.  No, you can see it.  You can see it from there.  And Holly Weird.  Holly Weird.  No, I'm not giving this to you.  No, I'm giving this to you.  No, I want to see.  I enjoy the poison.  I just want to see.  Come on, that's your bit.  Let me just see.  No, so you can see.  I want to see the back cover and the front cover.  Oh, there's a chick on the front.  Let me see it.  All right.  Anyone wants to check out the chick?  That's not a chick.  That's me.  Thank you. 
[01:49:30]  That's me with the airbrush.  That's not a chick.  That's me.  Cece.  I went to Richard Speck's doctor.  You know the guy that killed all those doctors?  Yes.  Nice reference.  Yes.  You've got to get in there.  Perfect for today's show.  Wow.  Okay.  I'm seeing that.  He's in jail and stuff.  So I went to the same doctor.  It's wonderful.  Snake, tap.  He's very injured.  Hey, Cece, you're still banging girls?  Once in a while.  You know, mostly I just like to just like stroke them.  Stroke them?  I like to stroke them. 
[01:50:00]  Yes.  Yeah?  All right.  I like to stroke them.  Well, that's a nice CD.  That's great.  Hello.  Oh, Big and Anthony.  What are you?  All right.  Uh-oh.  What did that do you mean?  Why was that?  There's a CD case all over the place.  All right, Cece, we'll see.  We'll see you when you come to town.  Yes, Cece.  I can't wait to see you guys.  All right.  Listen, be good.  All right.  Thank you, Cece.  Bye-bye.  Cece.  Oh, damn.  You didn't get Cece. 
[01:50:30]  Couldn't get her.  Oh, my God.  The T-cell dropping to her.  You're horrible.  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  Makes me yearn for the whistler of yesterday.  Gonna jump off that post into the boxes.  I so was never into that band.  Into the Poison, Lewis Park?  No.  He doesn't even know what Poison is.  Yeah, I know what Poison is.  He was kind of, you know, back in the 80s.  I know. 
[01:51:00]  They were never.  They looked like the New York Dolls.  Yeah?  Remember them?  No.  The New York Dolls?  You didn't know the New York Dolls?  Are you serious?  Hey, can we bring in the cheerleader?  Yeah, let's do this.  We need cheerleaders for our softball game.  And, girls, you just got to show up.  Right.  It's easy as that.  Just show up.  And we take a look at you, and then we decide if you should be on the field with us.  Yes.  A week from Saturday.  Mary, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I am at a sticker stop right now.  I'm in front of Spirits Unlimited, which is on 35 South in Orderly Beach, New Jersey. 
[01:51:30]  So, we're right by the MTV house, apparently.  Okay.  And you're handing out the wow stickers, right?  Yes, I am.  Very nice.  And some dude wowed me.  I didn't get a chick to wow me on the way here, but a guy did.  That does anything.  That's awful.  That does nothing.  Whatever.  I'm trying.  All right, Mary.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, Oakfield.  Oh, Mary, Mary, Mary.  Okay.  Wow.  Oh, gee. 
[01:52:00]  All of a sudden, you're one for three today.  So what?  I remember her from the Naughty Nighting contest.  Yep.  Oh, wow.  What's your name?  Christy.  Christy, yeah.  Christy.  I remember Christy.  Wow, look at the, yes, the bathing suit.  Very nice.  Look at that.  She's got a wow bikini.  All over tan?  All over tan?  All over.  Yeah, there you go.  When you flash Louis?  Oh, it's yours.  Golden brown.  Wow.  Perfect. 
[01:52:30]  Golden brown boobies.  Golden brown.  Golden brown hair.  Well, she's a white chick.  She's just, uh...  I'm Sicilian, that's why.  She's very tan.  Yeah, and very...  Fighting to stay in there.  They're so big and juicy.  Just fighting to stay in that little bikini top.  Unlike Chandra's, where the bikini thing just falls with nothing to hold on anymore.  There's no reason to go back there.  Stop.  And by the way, I don't like David Blaine stealing that trick from Eric Clapton's kid.  That really bothers me.  Oh, my God.  Wow. 
[01:53:00]  That's horrible.  That's from you.  That is horrid.  That's from you?  No, I didn't say that.  That was Jimmy.  I know, but for you, you judging horribly.  Well, I have a line.  Wow.  Wow, that's the line?  It's very fluid.  It shifts like the tides.  What's next?  A Jimmy Carter joke?  Oh.  What?  Old?  Well, gee, who's the latest celebrity kid that fell out a window?  Yeah, exactly.  You've got to kind of go back.  Yeah.  Clapton's kid would be 30 if he was alive today.  You're acting like it happens every 35 seconds. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, for the love of Eve, why don't you quit chiding me?  Oh, you're right.  I agree.  All right, well, let's see what everyone thinks about, what's your name again?  Christy.  Christy, yes.  Christy.  I need a pen.  I need a pen.  Wait, I want to get, let's get Stinky in here.  We haven't heard from him.  Yeah, Stinky's got a.  Stinky!  Got a home, too.  It's a secret ballad.  Secret.  Stinky, what do you think of Christy?  She's perfect.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Perfect cheerleader.  My gosh.  I'm thinking that's what we need.  Opie, what are you thinking?  Let me give these two.  Uh, let's get Earl in here.  Why?  Earl.  We'd like to see what people think.  Well, you know what?  We give our opinions, and then the secret ballad really is what everyone goes on.  So I think, uh, yeah, I think she'd make it.  Earl, what do you think?  Earl, what do you think?  Last time we asked you, the last girl you said just missed.  Yes.  Yes what?  Yes. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  He's trying to talk, Norton's molesting him for no reason.  He's excited.  Go ahead, Earl.  Norton's excited.  Earl?  Yes, absolutely.  All right.  Hmm.  How old are you?  Stop blowing in my ear.  23?  Solid.  Anyone else, Jim?  Ah.  Forget about it, right?  Yeah, yeah, she's really sexy.  All right.  Hmm.  Let's see.  Okay.  Lewis, you're going to vote?  There you go.  Ooh.  Oh. 
[01:55:00]  Why'd you ask eight of us what we thought, and then we're doing the secret ballot?  Yeah, we're going to do the secret ballot.  Okay, it's not much of a secret anymore.  Well, can you read what he wrote?  Come on.  All right, we're going to do the secret ballot.  Secret ballots are coming in here.  All right.  Collecting Ant's writing.  You're writing a novel.  No, I'm not. 
[01:55:30]  It's a yes or no, but I have to put conditions on it.  You've got to conditions, and then you've got to write what would she look like if she  died in an accident, and then we have to go back to that.  No, I'm not thinking about that.  Yes, you are.  You are.  No.  Yes, you're a lord.  Three different colors.  You are lost today.  That's why we do the secret ballot.  You have damaged me.  All right.  Secret ballot.  Oh, Earl now?  See, Earl isn't in yet.  All right, who's going to read the secret ballots out loud?  Oh, okay.  Well, that's good enough, because...  Earl? 
[01:56:00]  Let me see about Earl.  Yeah, okay.  Okay, okay.  Give me your secret ballot.  Nice.  Who's reading the secret ballots today?  Secret ballots.  Who's reading?  I read last time.  Lewis?  Lewis.  All right, Lewis, you are the...  Lewis, if you take this job on, you've got to read what is written.  Yeah.  Don't puss out, okay?  Okay.  There's a lot of honesty that goes on with the secret ballot stuff.  Here we go.  All right.  This is to decide if Christy's going to be in.  As far as a cheerleader, right?  Okay, there's nine people in the room.  I've got 32 votes. 
[01:56:30]  Here is the secret ballot.  I'll keep track.  No.  Who said...  Wow.  Hold on, Chris.  This is straight out no.  Christy, one no so far.  Okay.  I want to bang her.  That's Jim Norton.  You can kind of tell whose secret ballot it is.  I think that's a yes.  Of course that's a yes.  I mean, I would guess we wrote that.  It's a secret ballot.  Will you shut up?  Oh, wow.  All right.  Sure, only if we can cut off her head. 
[01:57:00]  Wait, is that a yes or a no?  It said sure.  Yeah.  All right, we'll do a yes.  That's awful.  Okay.  Yes, but lose the hair.  What's wrong with the hair?  It's great.  I like the hair.  I like it.  That's not the problem.  Yes.  Three yeses, one no.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You said be honest.  Tough, guys.  Tough.  You said.  Read what's on the paper. 
[01:57:30]  Can't take it back.  He's very literal.  He's very literal.  Can't you say effing?  No, I can't say that.  When it says the effing thing.  No, no, I don't say that.  You got to say effing.  The schmuck got to say it, and you got to say it.  Well, and you.  Oh, but then all of a sudden it's written on paper, verboten.  Verboten.  All right.  Well, yeah, we can't say that.  Okay, no effing way.  Okay.  She's a man.  Oh, what guy has cans like that?  That's. 
[01:58:00]  Well, I don't.  I don't.  Don't investigate me.  That was obviously.  Breast is just like that.  All right.  The next secret ballot.  I thought we said these girls are supposed to be hot.  I say no.  And then it was written properly for me.  Effing way.  Okay.  That was written in a proper.  That's another no.  What's the score?  I got three yeses and three noes.  Okay.  All right.  Next secret ballot.  This is for Christy.  I got.  To be a cheerleader.  Week from Saturday.  Yes.  Every softball game.  As long as we can put a catcher's mask on her. 
[01:58:30]  Wow.  This is brutal.  You guys are awful.  This is brutal.  This is really.  Oh, my God.  I don't know why people.  Christy.  Why people show up to you.  There is hotness.  There is hotness right there.  No, no.  What's going on between the two of them is nice.  What's the score?  Nice.  Hold on.  That was a yes, I think.  So, there's four yeses, three noes.  All right.  But she's got to wear a catcher's mask.  Okay.  Nice cans.  Tan shows off belly hair.  Land the lakes in the mug.  What is that? 
[01:59:00]  In the mug.  What?  Well, that's what it says.  I'm just reading it.  Don't ask for explanations from me.  Is that a yes or a no?  Yes.  Yes.  You got lost there with that.  Nice cans.  Nice cans.  Tan shows off belly hair.  Land the lakes in the mug.  I don't know.  Very cryptic.  It's...  Well, yeah.  All right.  Butter in the mug.  All right.  Five yeses, three noes.  Okay.  And then, yes, with no funny comment.  In parentheses.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:59:30]  Let me see that.  It actually said...  No funny comment.  No funny comment.  That's a yes.  That's a yes.  It's a winner.  She's a winner.  And then, finally, I'd bang her if she had a...  Oh, jeez.  I can't even...  This was just wrong.  I'd bang her if she had a C, like CC.  Yeah.  I wonder who wrote that.  Yeah.  Boss.  I can't believe that one.  Seven yeses? 
[02:00:00]  It said, yes.  Can I buy you a house?  Yes.  That's it.  It's a winner.  Wait, you're in.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Those yes counts only count if you put a catcher's mask on and chop her head off.  No.  Dude, she's hot.  What are you talking about?  You're not even here.  Shut up.  She's solid.  All right.  I say Christy's in.  You are in.  She's in.  The voting was tough.  Yeah.  She survived the voting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She'll be there a week from Saturday.  Congrats.  You all right, Christy? 
[02:00:30]  I'm fine.  Yes.  You don't look fine.  Hello, friends, and ONA.com.  All right.  Very good.  There you go.  She's been feeling here a little bit hurt.  Yeah, she was hurt.  People said mean stuff about her.  I'm just.  That just can't find no one.  You can.  Imagine the T-F-ing you could do on that.  You betcha.  Right, Lewis?  Yep.  Do guys ask you for that a lot?  No, they don't.  No?  They don't ask me.  Oh, Lewis.  Oh, you had to.  Oh, Lewis.  I'm asking.  They never ask you to.  I've done it.  They could. 
[02:01:00]  Okay.  Really?  It seems like it would be a popular item.  Hold on.  She's going to go away sad.  No.  You all right?  I'm fine.  Where are you going?  You're not upset.  Right?  She's solid.  That's a nice, that's Jim P.R.  But that's the fake fine, they say.  She's a little upset.  She's a little upset.  What's wrong?  Well, it was me.  Well, some people.  What do I expect?  Some of the people are very mean.  Well, I mean, look, you're talking about Schmucko here who just spent half an hour describing  the dead Chandra Levy in ways that go beyond anything anyone has really imagined. 
[02:01:30]  But that was hot, not mean.  Laying there vulnerable, can't say no.  So, I mean, to walk into this, you've got to respect, you know, psychosis.  I think I made a statement by putting no funny comment.  If I can get my secret ballot out of the way.  I just said yes, and that's it.  Well, what, what, what?  Liar?  Don't even start, stinky.  Stop.  Funny bit.  Funny bit.  This should be great. 
[02:02:00]  I'd love to see a total breakdown here.  They start hitting each other.  Don't.  She doesn't look happy.  I don't know.  There's some mean things were said about her, and she's a very attractive girl, then.  Yeah.  Jim, go comfort her outside.  What are you, a legal staff now?  No, I'm just saying, I know.  I know that, but you're walking into this room.  You work here.  She doesn't need me to comfort her.  Come on.  Passing that.  You know, it is mean.  I understand that.  That's why I love you guys, though.  It's all right.  All right. 
[02:02:30]  There goes Christy.  All right.  They're mean.  They'll be there a week from Saturday.  A week from Saturday.  Yeah.  Thank you so much.  It's a great stadium.  Sponsored by Coors Light.  Look at that.  Wow.  Bravo.  There you go.  Someone go, Ted.  She's going to cry.  Poor God.  Not perhaps.  She's just going to go down to Edelweiss and have a couple drinks.  Stinky trying to turn me in there.  I know it was yours.  God, God.  What was yours?  I ain't saying until she leaves.  I didn't really think she's going to be there.  What was yours?  Turn the sound down. 
[02:03:00]  What was yours?  What was yours, Norton?  I want a bag.  I'm not just being polite, dude.  I think she's hot.  No.  He's gone.  Yeah.  Lewis, which one was mine?  She's completely hot.  Come on.  Not yours.  I don't know.  What's the matter, guys?  Not the Land O'Lakes.  Who wrote down everything out there, Garrett?  Who did the Land O'Lakes?  What was that?  Who did the Land O'Lakes sell?  And what does in the mug mean?  Who did that one?  Who?  Who?  Anyone?  Land O'Lakes for the mug?  Anyone?  Anyone? 
[02:03:30]  What, a ghost came in here?  That was the last one.  That's yours?  I'm not saying anything until I know.  Well, I just want to know what a mug is.  Huh?  She's all right?  Rick, go talk to her.  Yeah, Rick.  Please.  Rick, go talk to her.  Just for a second.  She's really upset.  Go talk to her.  Mine was the catcher's mask.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that was awesome.  Like there was no doubt.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  As soon as I went through them again, there it was.  Yeah.  What was yours?  Mine was the Land O'Lakes.  I didn't want to say Butterface.  Oh.  So, Land O'Lakes mug.  Hoping everyone but her would get the secret message.  I didn't miss that.  I did that one.  Oh, wow.  You know.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  This might be the show when I go to hell that God shows me on videotape. 
[02:04:30]  Lewis Black, June 14th, Town Hall.  The funny thing is, Lewis isn't leaving.  He doesn't want us to talk bad about him after we leave.  He'll be here right until 7.  I can't.  I got to go.  But I'm going to talk badly about Lewis.  Of course not.  No.  Not while he's here.  Not while I'm here.  Oh, he's a pal of the show.  Okay.  A little break and we'll continue.  Jimmy Schubert calling in.  Schubert.  Schubert.  And Joni.  Joni Lauer. 
[02:05:00]  China.  Who are we kidding?  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  But the WWE gets all pissed off if she uses the China name.  She's not using it.  We're using it so people know who the hell we're talking about.  That's right.  She got thrown all over that ring last night by Joey Budafuco.  I think that's her now.  Oh, crap.  Oh, that's Schubert.  Okay.  Stay there.  I got the cheddar.  I could pay the rank.  Four, three, two.  All right.  Being a black guy.  Ooh, fun.  Call me daddy.  I'm your cheddar man.  All right. 
[02:05:30]  Okay.  Hope you like crap.  N-W-  Here comes the, ready and I.  Here comes the boys from the sound.  Here comes the, ready and I.  How you like me now, I say.  Here comes the, ready and I.  Here comes the boys from the sound.  Here comes the, ready and I. 
[02:06:00]  P.O.D. Boom! We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We have a full house today.  Louis Black has to leave us, Anthony.  I know. What are you doing? That's so important.  I have to go. Stop it!  Norton is out of control.  He's like tussling your hair.  A little tussle.  Look at a little comic tussle.  Oh, man.  It just reminds me of that night we were in prison. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  And he'd reach over and cuddle with me.  Back in the good old days.  When he used to be a cuddler.  Just that, the light just swinging in the cell and you guys on those jailhouse bunks and the lights go out and you just hear Jimmy go,  Want some company?  And then you hear, put the finger in and wiggle it.  I'll stick it here.  Why don't we get Louis out of here? 
[02:07:00]  Guys, it's been great.  He's playing June 14th at Town Hall.  Yeah, come.  We're all going to be there.  Absolutely.  It's going to be a great, great show.  All right.  I'll be in, I'll call you guys from Ireland.  Oh, can't wait.  Ireland.  Yeah, because I might probably need a detox when I get back and I want you to set up something.  From Ireland.  You going with Jeffrey Ross?  No, I'm not.  Oh, I heard that he was going over there last I saw him.  Is that right?  I saw him over the last weekend at Caroline's.  Very funny gentleman.  Yes, he is.  Very funny man.  I thought maybe you were in Cahoots.  No, I don't know if he's going.  He may be going to that festival. 
[02:07:30]  Where are you going, sweetie?  I'm going tomorrow.  I'll miss you.  All right.  We got to wing it on.  Okay, guys, have fun.  It's been fun, but we got Joni on the line, so we're going to come out of here.  Oh!  So we're going to say goodbye to you.  Take care, guys.  Take it easy.  So take the awkward walk out of the studio while we're still alive.  I take it into the studio.  Louis, I love you.  You know that.  All right.  Louis Black, everyone.  June 14th, Town Hall. 
[02:08:00]  There he goes.  Joni!  Hi, you guys.  Joni.  My buddies.  I'm so happy to have you back on our show.  Let me tell you something.  You know, last time you were on, we were a little rough with you.  I said that I wasn't digging the muscular butt in Playboy and all that.  But, you know, there's a lot of guys that, you know, find that very attractive and very sexy.  Let me tell you something.  Joni changed her look a little bit.  Joni, you looked really, really good last night. 
[02:08:30]  You got a much softer presence there.  Well, you know, now that I don't have to play that character, I can kind of go back to it, which is great.  So now I can do anything, you know?  Your hair is a little lighter and you're not as, uh, as, uh...  It's not like the muscles aren't like bodybuilder muscles.  You're still extremely fit, but you're a little more ladylike.  Yes, I changed my hair color back to my natural color.  I lost about 12 pounds.  That's your natural color?  And I feel great.  And, Joni, you're going to be very surprised, but we stood up for you today. 
[02:09:00]  Big time.  Come on.  I swear.  Yeah, we thought Buda Fuco looked like the biggest scumbag last night during that celebrity boxing.  You know what?  I thought so, too.  I was like, when you're in there and you're doing that, it was just, I couldn't see what I was doing, you know?  I was just trying to fight back.  I had an hour training before walking into that thing.  Really, yeah.  And they had been training for two months.  He had almost 100 pounds on me. 
[02:09:30]  And I was thinking, okay, the idea is to win the boxing match, right?  Yeah.  That's the idea.  I mean, not go in there with ego.  I'm not a boxer.  I know that.  Go in there and just try and land some punches and win the match.  That was the idea.  And it's hard when you have somebody coming at you just to, like, you know, and he was playing dirty.  I was like, the first time he pushed me down, I don't know if you could see the look on my face.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The look was pretty much, what the F?  Well, I was thinking in my head, I was waiting for my corner people to go, take him down, take him down, you know? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  You had some great shots, like right when you guys would come out of the corner, you were pretty much the aggressor right off the bat.  And you had some great combinations.  And then he would just run into you, kind of tie you up, and then push you.  He was, yeah, he was holding me a couple of shots.  He was holding me behind the head and punching with his other hand.  Yeah, I saw that, I saw that.  He was punching me in the back of the head after the bell.  It is Joey Buttafuoco we're talking about here. 
[02:10:30]  Not a guy with the, he's not really an upstanding citizen.  I wouldn't think that he would fight any other way.  You know what, though?  No, and I kind of knew that, too.  And I knew that, you know, he's the one who has something to prove because he's going to look like a chump if I go out there and, you know, fuck him.  But he still looks like a chump anyways because even giving it all he had in a totally dirty way, I, with one hour of training, went out there and did a boxing match and landed some good technical shots.  This is how I feel. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, I would never fight a girl.  And I'm saying this to Joni.  Joni, I know you would kick my ass, okay?  But I would have a tough time just getting in the ring with a girl.  But I guess if I agreed to that, I would at least try to, you know, fight fair.  I don't know.  It's definitely a weird feeling.  It was, even when I watched last night, it was weird to see a man and a woman, like, really fighting.  And it was weird to see me being kind of manhandled and thrown around like that.  I mean, it really is bizarre when you're watching it.  It's totally different from when you're doing it. 
[02:11:30]  And what's the feedback been?  The feedback has been great.  I've had a million calls.  You know, I took a chance by going in there, too.  I didn't know it was going to happen.  But now that it's done, and I think I did, like, better than good.  I thought you won the fight.  Because I'm like, oh, my gosh, you know?  That'll never happen again in a million years.  Right.  I was scared for you.  There was one time that you couldn't see.  And you had your hands up to protect yourself. 
[02:12:00]  But he was behind you.  Yeah.  And you were, like, punching the back of the head.  He hit you after the bell, after the bell rang, he clocked you twice.  Very dirty.  I was just so, like, you know, my wheels were spinning.  I had five people yelling at me, go box, you know, clothesline them, take them down.  Hey, Joanie.  And, you know, they had asked me beforehand.  They said, you know, please, please, whatever you do, you know, make this a boxing match.  And so that was kind of going through my head.  The dirtier he played, the more I said, you know, if he has to do that after two months of training with a huge weight advantage, I'm boxing. 
[02:12:30]  So body slammed him, yeah.  And Anthony and I were arguing at this point in the back office today.  When you, at the end of the match, you said, hey, why don't you come in my ring and we'll wrestle?  And it's like, Joanie would still manhandle her.  And I'm like, no way.  I think Joanie would just kick his ass.  I don't know.  He's got big lung.  Because you know, holds and stuff.  I don't know.  Yeah, and plus, he was, like, breathing so hard.  Right.  And, um. 
[02:13:00]  Big hot butterfuco breath on you.  Ew.  Look at Joanie.  Ew.  Joanie, did he seem like.  That would have knocked me out right away.  Did he seem like the kind of guy that probably did the same thing at home with Mary Jo?  Like.  Wow, of course.  Threw her into walls.  I just picture the guy at home going, Mary Jo.  And just heaving her around when they were married.  Seems like a real scumbag.  He just came across.  Hey, you know, I guess originally, and I didn't know this, John Bobbitt was supposed to. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  You heard that, right?  Oh, yeah.  And I'm thinking it was such a better fight with me and Joey because, I mean, everybody  knows that.  I mean, even John Bobbitt's wife beat him up.  Right.  Right?  So.  She had a little advantage.  She had his schlong in her hand.  That was.  Kind of brings your morale down a bit when the girl's holding your junk and then throws it  out the window.  So, Joni, congrats.  Yeah, I think you did a good job.  Yeah, definitely.  What are you working on? 
[02:14:00]  Anything else?  Oh, I'm scared now.  Why?  What are they going to have me do next?  Yeah, I know.  Well, I want you to.  I've been wrestling in Japan for a company called New Japan.  I just got back from my first show, Tokyo Dome, 63,000 people were there.  Wow.  And it was, like, incredible to be in the ring again and have the opportunity and, you  know, just to be rocking and rolling again.  It's just great.  Any chance of getting back into the WWE?  Not unless there would be some major, major changes. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, boy.  You know?  I hate to hear that.  You know something, though?  It's never out of the question.  Well, listen, the good thing is that I missed.  My fans missed me.  And I think that's a wonderful thing.  And the fact that I can move on and, you know, make my own personal decision and be successful  and, you know, kick butt and take names on the way is great.  Yeah, the fact that Hogan's back.  Nothing bad about that, believe me.  The fact that Hogan's back there, it means nothing's impossible.  Jesus Christ, who saw that one coming?  That's right.  And believe it or not, I think he's having some of the best matches. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  Well, we told JR personally that we're not big fans of the comeback of Hogan.  I was really into Willie Mays, but I don't want to go, I don't want to see him hit a ball  anymore.  Yeah, but don't you think that Hogan's very entertaining just from an entertainment standpoint?  Because if you're looking for a real physical match, they're not doing that a whole lot  anymore.  No, they're not.  You know?  The leg drop and, I like Brock Lesnar. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, yeah, he's pretty beefy.  He's a freak.  Hey, you're not, you didn't grow attractive to Joey or anything.  You're not going to go shooting any ladies in the head, are you?  She tends to bring that out in chicks.  They walk up to women and shoot them in the head.  No, I would hope I wouldn't do that, but hey, I'm going to have to be looking over  my shoulder now.  Yeah, look out for Amy.  You should have done that.  You should have done that.  In the rematch, there's going to be some run-ins from the audience.  You should have done that fist to the groin thing you used to do. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, everyone was waiting for that one.  Yeah.  I know, but see, because you were waiting for it.  He'd have gone, hey, joke's on you, I got no balls.  I mean, you have to admit that you didn't think that that was going to happen last night,  right?  Yeah.  No.  I would have liked to have seen her.  All right, Joni, we're going to let you go.  All right, fellas.  But you did a great job.  Yes.  Thanks.  Good to talk to you again.  Yeah.  Definitely.  We'll talk to you again soon.  All right.  All right, Joni.  Thank you.  Joni Lauer.  Oh, wait, wait. 
[02:16:30]  Stop.  I don't want to see how that worked out.  I bet she said yes.  Formerly China.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People have got to understand who she is.  I know, but I guess her management is all panicky because every time someone mentions  China, the WWE gets on their case.  What do they want?  What do they expect?  You can't just forget it.  You can't put it out of your mind.  You know, you could throw her out of the organization, but whenever she's on something, people are going  to go, oh, it's China. 
[02:17:00]  It's China.  Let's see what she's up to.  You know, her is China.  All right, Jimmy Schubert on hold.  We've got to get to him next, so stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening to Corky and Cara Ann Quinlan.  Opie and Anthony.  I'd rather hear my penis in a vice than listen to those jokes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We made him wait for like 40 minutes. 
[02:17:30]  Jimmy Schubert.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  We have a real busy show today, Jimmy.  I'm sorry, bud.  No, I've enjoyed listening to it.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you?  Good, buddy.  How are you?  We've got Jim Norton in the studio.  I know.  Jimmy's not a big fan of Spider-Man, from what I understand.  I haven't seen it.  Oh, right.  The line.  Yeah.  I didn't get that.  I got it.  It took me a while.  And then Rich Voss, the awful Rich Voss.  What's happening, man?  Hey, Richie.  How are you?  Good.  How's it going, bro?  Good, man.  Last time I saw Richie was filling in for me at the Chicago Comedy Festival because I  got some bad chicken and I spent like two and a half hours in the toilet doing twirl art. 
[02:18:00]  I hosted that show for you.  And what's his name came on stage?  Who was the guy that was from Andy Kaufman?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Tony Clifton.  Yeah, Tony Clifton, the character.  Remember?  Were you there when he came in?  Oh, yeah.  People thought he was serious.  Did he smack that guy around and threw water in his face?  I got pictures of Schubert.  He was so sick.  He looked like he just like fell off a heroin binge or something.  And you stood in his place.  Well, I was supposed to headline the show and he was hosting it.  Boy, what a disappointment.  God, man.  Schubert figured if he's got to suffer, so does the crowd. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Actually, he did a great job.  I'm actually in Philly this week.  I'm getting ready to do the comedy cabaret up there on the Roosevelt Boulevard.  All weekend?  Yeah, I'm there Friday, Saturday.  I got one show Friday, 930.  One show Saturday, 930.  Nice.  We need you back in the studio, man.  Yeah, I'm coming up there in July, actually.  I'm going to be doing the Rascals.  I'm definitely going to come in the studio with you guys and hang out.  We got to do some pottying.  If you're in town tonight, you can come over to Caroline and just see me and Patrice O'Neal on the Nasty Show at 10 o'clock.  Oh, yeah.  I'm down in Philly, though, bro. 
[02:19:00]  And where would that be, Jimmy?  I had to get it.  Jimmy?  Oh, the comedy cabaret.  Yeah, comedy cabaret.  Boss, you're awful.  Boss throwing in his own plug in the middle.  God damn it.  It's about Jimmy right now.  Why don't you just post it on eatabullet.com?  Oh, God.  You're awful.  That is awful.  Man.  Hey, Schubert, you see any of that celebrity boxing?  Yeah.  Actually, Horshack took a beating, huh?  Yeah.  He got beat by Screech.  That's just pretty awful. 
[02:19:30]  That's like getting Joey Botafuco to that girl.  He did everything but have his girlfriend come in and shoot her in the head between rounds.  The Screech thing, though, is like, you know, all right, he was Screech on the show when he was a kid, but the guy now, you know, is in much better shape than Ron Polillo.  Yeah, well, I think Screech is on the roid, dude.  Well, if he's on the roids, it looks like Ron Polillo was the inspiration for the movie Philadelphia.  Really?  You guys see him?  He's pretty bad, yeah.  He looks like an AIDS patient. 
[02:20:00]  He was all over him like a bum in a bologna sandwich.  Horrid.  Right from the ring.  He just beat the guy like a rented mule.  One of the best parts, when Screech stands back and goes to stretch and fold his arms like, you ain't nothing, and Horshack thinks he's going to take this opportunity for the big knockout blow, so he lunges at him and puts his fist forward.  Screech does this little step and just rails him right in the face.  Like he thought that was going to be his big moment.  Oh, Mr. Cutter, I'm going to knock him out.  He dropped the guy like he hit the ass at the second hand to Woodstock. 
[02:20:30]  Boom.  The guy's laying in the middle of the ring doing a 911 shuffle.  His head was bouncing back so bad.  Yeah.  All the guys that sponsored him actually advertised on the bottom of his shoes.  Well, there you go.  Good night, ladies and gentlemen.  Here's Dan from Hoboken.  So, Jimmy Schubert's bad chicken not only hurt him, but hurt an audience full of people.  Oh.  Why does Voss have to take this?  Hey, Schubert.  Yo.  You ever hang out and jack it with Voss on the bed with a chick? 
[02:21:00]  No, I haven't had the opportunity.  It's really nice.  You never had a...  Mine's bigger, but his is smoother.  You know, but Richie Voss is the type of guy who'd show up at a wife swap and party stag.  Hey, so we're supposed to swap.  Hey, where's your wife at?  Where are the chicks?  Well, Schubert got a hummer from Roseanne.  No, really?  Yeah, a long time ago, bro.  You never heard of that story?  No.  We had it on our show.  Yeah.  We took one for the team.  We took one for the team. 
[02:21:30]  I actually had a driver.  I was staying.  I was renting a room down in Culver City, and part of the thing was no overnight guests.  And she was so drunk, she didn't know where she was staying.  She was staying with a friend.  And she had just kind of...  I think she had just orally copulated Sam upstairs in the thing, and he wanted to get rid of her.  And he said, hey, would you mind doing a favor and dropping her off?  And she didn't know where she lived, and I wasn't going to put her in the street.  So she came back to this place.  I had to sneak this drunk, 250-pound woman into this house in Culver City.  She's bouncing off the walls. 
[02:22:00]  And then I said, do you take the bed?  And then she grabbed me, and the next thing you know, she was swallowing down the trunk.  He wrote a man show.  So you took the fat friend.  You did somebody a favor.  Oh, God.  What was that?  I just laughed her in the face.  It's not the end of my love stick.  Did she do it well?  Hey, I put it on my resume.  You know what?  I could have been Tom Arnold.  Do you know what I'm saying?  I go six inches to the left.  I'm Tom Arnold.  She doing well?  I'm doing great, man.  I actually just...  You know, but I'm traveling around a lot.  It's just a pain. 
[02:22:30]  I didn't ask you.  I said, did she do it well?  Oh, yeah, of course.  You know fat chicks.  They got to do it well.  They try harder, right?  They try harder, yeah.  Oh, no.  I was so drunk, I just flipped over a roll of skin and just put it in there.  You had it.  So she stayed the whole night?  Yeah, and then I took her out and dropped her off at a bus stop.  I don't know.  It was a long time ago.  I'm not proud of it, but hey.  Was she a headliner then?  No, no.  She was just on the cover of Middle Act magazine that month. 
[02:23:00]  You didn't bang that, though?  What's that?  You didn't bang it?  What?  No, man.  Come on.  Are you kidding me?  I put it inside like a Maxwell's coffee can.  I think you'd hit that.  Yeah, you have to put a wood sham in there just to get a little friction on it.  I don't know.  It seems like in that situation, you'd kind of just hit it anyway.  You're home.  Yeah, I guess I should have committed, but I didn't want just on the outside chair. 
[02:23:30]  She was a screamer.  You know, I would have had the lady banging on my door.  You got somebody in there?  Then they look in the morning to see who leaves, and it's her.  Yeah, I actually got kicked out of the house not too long after that.  I guess she found out.  We had roommates.  When I had roommates, we had a fat girl.  I had a fat girl.  I brought a mattress down into the basement or in the garage, and I would bang them in the  basement so my roommates wouldn't have seen me with a fat girl.  You're the worst, man.  Yeah.  We were having a big party, like 200 people, and I'm dragging a mattress out to the garage. 
[02:24:00]  What are you doing now?  Because I'm going to bang this fat girl.  That's good.  You're awful, man.  I'm going to go bang this fat girl.  You got some class.  That's funny.  There's nothing wrong with it when it's all that's available.  Yeah, dude, to be honest with you, dude, I've never been into it, man.  I just couldn't do it.  Just to look into their eager, maybe he'll love me when he's done face.  Oh, no.  I can't do it.  It's awful.  The scary thing is, if you're doing it from behind doggy styles, it feels like you're 
[02:24:30]  doing it to a middle linebacker to get a little chunky.  Nice visual.  Just to hear back and talk, you got to yell, boo!  Any other celebrities?  You do any other celebrities?  Suck it.  Hey, you know, how about you, Rich?  You do any other celebrities?  Well, I...  Are you doing anyone famous?  Well, no, she wasn't really famous, and I didn't really...  Like, I was with one girl, but I don't think I should say her name.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But she actually stood outside her house and whacked it in the bushes. 
[02:25:00]  No.  That was excellent.  You should.  I don't think she was really that famous anyhow.  Yeah, write it down.  We won't say anything.  Just so we know.  You probably don't even know who she is.  Exactly.  Yeah, see.  Is that English?  What is it?  Let me see.  Let me see, boss.  Can you possibly...  Oh, my God.  Read it.  It says Chandra Levy.  He said he dropped off in a park in Washington and hasn't heard from her since.  She wasn't famous.  No, she had a sick...  Who is it?  This is your handwriting?  I was scribbling it real quick.  What do you expect?  I got little fingers.  I got little hands. 
[02:25:30]  And what are you trying to write?  Let me see.  Is that an A?  Is that an A, really?  Listen, when you're...  Look, I signed a lot of autographs, so I scribbled real quick.  Shut up.  He wrote down the name, Jimmy, and we can't decipher it.  Oh, my God.  She was on a sitcom?  She's married.  I'm not going to say it.  I can't even see it.  I can't even read it.  Could you write it better, dude?  No, she's married.  So?  Did he do it while she was married?  I don't know.  I don't know if she was.  She might have been.  I don't know.  I know I was, and I never fooled around when I was married, but I don't know if she... 
[02:26:00]  I don't know her deal.  But it wasn't half as famous as Roseanne or half as big.  See, the Linda Carter or Tip O'Neill.  I'm trying to read it.  There's nothing there.  Schubert, anything else going on?  Nothing, man.  I just want to call and say, hey, I'm going to see you guys at the end of the line.  Yeah, we'll have some beers, have some fun.  Absolutely.  Punch it, men.  Are you going to Chicago this year?  Yeah, actually, I am.  Are you going to be up there?  No, no.  They're having a big softball game that weekend, a big celebrity softball game, so they needed 
[02:26:30]  me to get some celebrities down.  Right.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, no one else could drive them from the airport.  All right, Jimmy.  Hey, guys.  Good talk to you.  Take care of you, guys.  Now, give the plug again.  This weekend in Philly.  Yeah, this weekend in Philly.  We're going to be at the Comedy Cabaret on Roosevelt Boulevard.  One show Friday, one show Saturday at 9.30.  All right.  We'll see you soon, bro.  Thanks, guys.  Take care of you, man.  All right, man.  Jimmy Schubert, everyone.  Jimmy Schubert, man.  He's such a cool guy.  He used to tour with Kinnison.  Yeah.  I got pictures of him so knocked out in Chicago, laying on a bed and just... 
[02:27:00]  You with your yam bag in his mouth.  That's what you know.  Eh, why not?  He was sleeping.  And his buddy is so funny.  Totally naked in your awful draw me Tippi the Turtle hat.  Remember those concepts they went at?  Draw Tippi the Turtle.  What's that?  Wow, is that a reference?  That's a good one.  That's the hat, though.  It really is.  Hey, speaking of the softball game.  Okay.  I have an addition that I believe we all overlooked that could be key player that I would have on my team if I could. 
[02:27:30]  Saw him today as I pulled in the garage here.  I was thinking the same thing.  Oh, Jamaican Mike.  Jamaican Mike.  Yes.  Come on.  The guy, first of all, a black guy.  So you know he's good in the sports.  Whose pick is it, anyway?  That's what Jimmy the Greek said.  I think it's my pick again, huh?  Let me pick someone right in front of Rich Voss.  Oh.  When Voss is on the list, Norton's already picked.  Jesus Christ.  Dude, I was one of the first ones picked because you know you've got lightning in a bottle here.  You were picked because my brother was picked. 
[02:28:00]  No, no, no, no.  Where's the list?  I need a list.  The Celebrity Softball game is a week from Saturday.  Riverfront Stadium, home of the Newark Bears.  Beautiful place.  We love it.  It's sponsored by Coors Light.  Lots going on, Anthony.  I want to thank Sonic Blue's new Rio Riot MP3 player for helping us out with the softball game, okay?  Go to sonicblue.com to check them out.  It's a device.  You know, you put 5,000 songs in the palm of your hand.  Who added Rich Voss to Internet Movie Database? 
[02:28:30]  I mean, this is where everybody who, as a matter of fact, look at, look at, you ever been to Internet Movie Database?  You go there, you put in a celebrity's name, it gives their entire list of credits.  You're in there.  Look, there's nothing.  It says,  Wow, where'd they get all those credits from? 
[02:29:00]  I don't know.  But if you put in, like, Jim Norton...  You'll get me mixed in with some other Jim Norton.  Some other Jim Norton, because his first film is back in 1973.  Is that you?  1965?  That's not me.  Jimmy, that ain't you.  There's no lesions on that guy.  Jim Norton I, born in Dublin, Ireland.  Exactly, 1938, I believe, right? 
[02:29:30]  What are you listed under?  Probably One Trick Pony or One Hit Wonder.  I only have a couple of films.  The Adam Dubin films, which I did and I'm very proud of.  C3films.com.  And also, the Spider-Man.  How about White Chicks?  Weren't you in that?  Yes, White Chicks Incorporated.  American Dummy.  Rock Bottoms.  I did a film called American Dummy with Otto and George, then Louis Black, and I did  Sidesplitters.  And I got to make out with Nina Hartley in one of those films.  Nice.  Nice.  Did they ever see the video of White Chicks, you performing in that?  Did they ever see that? 
[02:30:00]  No, but I was horrendous.  Really?  I want to get the whole Jim Norton collection.  Oh, was I bad?  Funny, when we did the screening.  You are the worst actor I've ever seen.  You're the worst.  No way, pal.  You've got to see Voss in this.  I stink.  Wait, you both were in the same film?  Yeah.  Get me a copy of that.  Dude, I stink.  Yeah.  But I was embarrassed to be sitting next to him.  No, no.  They edited me bad.  I only played a bartender.  They couldn't edit you any other way. 
[02:30:30]  What parts did you guys play?  I played famous comedian Jim Norton.  Famous comedian.  And he played the wise, cracking bartender.  And we both stunk.  We did the screening.  The silence.  Boy, was I awful.  Did you guys have dialogue together?  Not together, no.  I had more than him, unfortunately.  Who's got a copy of that?  I do.  You've got to bring it in.  Voss brought in something today that we didn't get to.  No, no. 
[02:31:00]  It's just the roast, where he was hosting the roast down at last year with Patrice and  me.  Yeah.  It's just something to look on the side.  Something to chuckle to later in the office?  Norton was on fire.  When we roast, we're attacking each other, and we don't hold back, man.  No, really?  He killed Jay Moore one year.  Unbelievable.  Is that on that tape?  No.  Jay, we have another great moment we don't have.  I have it somewhere.  But we do have copies of our performances in White Chicks. 
[02:31:30]  I was sinking in my chair at the premiere.  I was so bad.  I got to see this.  Come on.  I was horrendous.  Where can we get it?  I'll get you a copy.  I don't know if there's a website.  Maybe Luis Pizzino.  What's the movie about, though?  Jim Florentine and Artie Fletcher stars these two guys.  Oh, no.  That find...  Yeah, already, the plot line is brilliant.  And they find...  They hate...  They're two losers.  It's called White Chicks?  White Chicks.  This is it.  They're two losers. 
[02:32:00]  And they go to this witch doctor for a potion that makes them celebrities.  Oh, my God.  And I play the famous comedian Jim Norton.  And it was actually a very, very beautiful Russian girl.  Can you give me some of your dialogue?  No, because I did my little stage thing.  I was supposed to be really cool.  And I was so bad.  You made Sandy Shore look clever.  I can't even find it. 
[02:32:30]  The only White Chicks on the thing I see is Black D's Inn.  No, this was about...  And then it says White Chicks.  This is about two absolute losers that somehow become celebrities.  I mean, it has nothing to do with the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. either.  This was just basically about two guys that took a magic potion.  A magic potion.  But the thing is, Florentine was good in it.  He was good in it, Florentine.  What was your role?  I played a bartender.  I know, but do you have any dialogue? 
[02:33:00]  I don't even remember.  Yeah, stupid, you did.  Everyone tried to forget it.  What?  You got to see the mugs on him.  Every time he would say a line, his eyes would bug out.  So how about the other dumb movie you got me in where I played...  Rock Bottom?  It wasn't bad.  No, I'm not saying dumb.  They had me play like a bounce, like a bodyguard.  And I'm supposed to pull out...  I'm supposed to pull out a...  Exactly.  I'm afraid to catch you with tiny hands.  And I'm supposed to pull out a gun.  And there's a Twinkie in my pocket.  And I go, oh, my kid has the gun. 
[02:33:30]  Right?  That was...  Oh, and I'm dodging her.  But that was an improvement over our performances in the other.  In the other one.  Because I wasn't good in Rock Bottom either.  But I was really bad in the other one.  If I wasn't that bad at all...  God, I want to see this so bad now.  Oh, I stink, dude.  That guy's got to bring in some of the movies.  I love looking at bad performances.  What was one of the lines you had in that movie, White Chicks?  I have no idea because it was so...  Norton knows.  Norton knows.  Come on, you remember one.  I'm trying to...  It was so...  You block it out.  It's like the kid who's being assaulted who pretends he's at a carnival eating cotton candy. 
[02:34:00]  Instead of having his little tough skins yanked off.  That's what I did while watching you in that film.  I was sitting watching the film with my manager at the time.  And he wouldn't talk to me for like three days after it.  Where was this premiere?  At Norton's house.  No, it was in the theater.  It was a big thing.  Was it?  It was nice.  Yeah, and it was shot on film.  Wow.  Oh, baby.  It was like 60 grand, 80 grand for it.  And, well, that's money lost. 
[02:34:30]  And I'm not totally responsible for that due to my performance didn't help, though.  I'll be honest about my performance being terrible.  I've done some good acting work, too.  Besides, what I'm very proud of.  But White Chicks Incorporated, I was awful.  White Chicks Incorporated.  Parami was good at White Chicks.  Parami, he's a Parami.  Jeff Parami is a big, fat comic.  He's a really funny guy from Pennsylvania.  And he played the witch doctor.  Very funny comic.  Oh, did you get some audio?  Yeah, yeah.  Go back.  Go back.  I want to read the thing there.  White Chicks.  The comedy follows Bill, Jim Florentine, and Lou, two of your basically horny, crass, 
[02:35:00]  clueless, beer-drinking, couch-potato, Jersey boys who can't get any.  And a relentless quest for that one simple deserved thing every man and woman is entitled to.  Sex.  After constant rejection and considerable humiliation, Bill and Lou seek help from Dr. Mugatu.  Oh, my God.  A once-wealthy voodoo doctor up in Harlem.  Yes, you guys.  With his magic potion, he guarantees them celebrityhood, that all elusive but necessary quality needed to score with chicks. 
[02:35:30]  Coerced by a bunch of zany characters, our hopeful heroes embark on a really fast trip into the world of fame, sex, and parties,  then crash into the morning after, guilt while still landing on their feet.  I may have some clips.  Oh, you've got to click on the pictures, too.  All right, let's...  The Year's Artist-Hitting Comedy.  Oh, whoa, hey!  I forgot how I enjoyed doing that, man. 
[02:36:00]  I forgot how I enjoyed doing that.  I forgot how I said it.  I forgot how I said it.  This is living proof that the American Indian asked Buffalo.  I forgot he was in that.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Let's see if we can get away with any more.  All right.  I have an angel.  That's a certain buzz.  A truly hardcore reality film.  Not afraid to ask enlightening questions.  Say the poignant statements.  Can I imagine you can help me?  Wayward doors.  It means lightning.  Say the poignant statements.  Then you have Gingy. 
[02:36:30]  That's a certain buzz.  Good social commentary.  Guys, I'm a parent.  Oh, Billy.  It's hard to hear, though.  You guys were looking at the video.  What were you seeing?  It's Jimmy surrounded by a bunch of girls going, it's amazing how many bird and ass-wipes get  all upset when you get a handy phone.  You're just all moving.  I was like Michael J. Fox talking to Larry King.  I was...  Hey, you know who else is in the movie? 
[02:37:00]  Jeff Norris.  That's an amateur comic.  Yeah, his title is Amateur Comic.  Are you sure that's the movie?  All right.  We'll get to take him.  Hey, well, can I have a question?  Is there a website there that's listed out where they can get it if they want it?  I have no money.  I get no money for this.  Dude, who knew www.whitechick.com is about the movie?  Is it really?  They got it.  It's not big enough where it's got its own website. 
[02:37:30]  Whitechick.com.  So enjoy the clip.  You want to see an abysmal Norton performance?  Welcome next.  What did you learn today?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW.  And it's time to play What Did We Learn on The Opie and Anthony Show today.  I want to thank Rich Voss for stopping by.  Thanks.  Thanks.  I was kidding.  Ouch.

Eric, what did you learn today?  I learned today that there's a nonstop Trent Reznor video playing in Anthony's head.  Yeah.  Yes.  And Norton, you're a really fun...  Speaking...  That doesn't work.  Speaking of that, Opie, Sam Sneed, golf legend, dead at 89 years old.  Golf legend, Sam Sneed.  Oh, boy. 
[02:38:30]  It looks like he finished his six under.  Oh.  Oh.  Would it be ironic if he died of a stroke?  Now he's one in whole.  Well, you know, he didn't leave a clean life, so it was far for the course.  Maybe that would have been funny if I said live and not leave.  Well, he didn't leave a clean life.  Keep going.  And lips nobody noticed.  Maybe it's far for the course. 
[02:39:00]  Oh.  Lips like a bird badge.  Anthony, what's up?  What did you learn?  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I learned always, always, at the end.  Yes.  Bravo, my friend.  He's hot.  Bravo.  Always.  Don't forget, right after us here in New York, the guys that kiss our asses, Ron and Fest.  Those two lovable ass kissers, Ron and Fest.  Frank, Frank, you're on Ron and Fest.  Hi, Frank.
