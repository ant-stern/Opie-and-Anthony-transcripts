<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast began with E-Rock hosting a "Worst Of" compilation.  The show opened with a discussion of the word "canoodling," quickly escalating into graphic descriptions of various sexual acts, including invented terms like "rusty trombone" and "dirty Sanchez." A former weatherman caller recounted an on-air mishap involving the word "shagged."  The hosts then engaged in a debate comparing sexual acts to sexual instruments.

The show then transitioned to a segment about cats, ranging from domestic cats to large felines like bobcats and cougars, expanding to include exotic pets such as tigers, alligators, and monkeys, and culminating in a discussion about the ideal pet for Anthony's son.  The segment featured humorous anecdotes about the frustrations of cat ownership, particularly concerning a cat named Bruiser Brody and his hygiene issues.  Savannah cats, their size, and potential aggression were also discussed.

Next, the show reviewed the Chicago radio show hosted by Eric and Kathy, a married on-air team. E-Rock criticized their lack of creativity and repetitive bits.  The hosts analyzed their on-air dynamic, described as an "affair without the sex," and dissected their website, which included features like a "passion name" generator, a photo gallery, and a blog. The segment included numerous offensive comments about Eric and Kathy and their show.  This segment also included analysis of specific segments from Eric and Kathy's show, such as "Six Ways to Tell Your Girl to Lose Some Weight," which contained extremely offensive and violent suggestions. Audio clips from Eric and Kathy’s show were played, including segments featuring sound effects portraying a "crazy woman" and discussions of their "work spouse" dynamic. Listener-submitted ideas on how to tell a spouse to lose weight, and discussions of marital problems and bad habits from their show were also played.  A "Guess the Sound" game was incorporated, featuring sexually explicit audio clips and listener calls, many of which were also sexually explicit and vulgar. Listener reactions to the Eric and Kathy material, ranging from amusement to shock, were included.

The show continued with a discussion about gym teachers, prompted by a recollection of a childhood gymnastics experience. The hosts shared anecdotes about their own gym teachers, often portraying them as disgruntled former athletes with career-ending injuries, primarily knee injuries. This transitioned into a discussion of their high school experiences, including cutting class to smoke marijuana and their academic performance. A bet regarding one host's ability to perform a pull-up led to a discussion of studio workout equipment owned by a producer named Mars, who demonstrated an impressive push-up routine (10 sets of 30).  Listener calls followed, sharing stories about their gym teachers, often reinforcing the narrative of washed-up athletes,  and including some dramatic tales of teacher deaths, including one in a snowplow accident described as a decapitation, and another on stage at an awards ceremony. The stories also included a gym teacher who was a wrestler (Tito Santana).  The segment ended with the hosts discussing their childhood fears (nuclear war and the Son of Sam, respectively), and a discussion about staff member Sal and his mustache.  The segment contained numerous vulgar and offensive terms.

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of childhood fears, with callers and hosts sharing anecdotes, including stories about the Gwad serial killer, the Cuban Missile Crisis, frightening law enforcement encounters, and a caller recounting a teacher's murder. Anthony shared childhood fears related to gang violence and a potentially dangerous encounter at a party.  The conversation then shifted abruptly to a highly explicit and racially charged discussion about pornography preferences with guests Patrice O’Neal and Louis C.K.  The discussion included explicit descriptions of sexual acts and body parts, frequent use of racial slurs, and offensive jokes. A caller, Wendy, identifying as a sex addict, joined, sharing explicit details of her experiences. The hosts and other callers engaged with her, using sexually explicit language and making further offensive remarks.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of sex addiction and sexually explicit commentary.

Another segment focused on sexually explicit discussions and anecdotes.  The conversation started with oral sex, followed by a caller, Jeff, describing his frequent visits to prostitutes and struggles with pornography addiction. The hosts debated kissing during sex. The conversation included explicit descriptions of sexual encounters, fantasies, and behaviors, including group sex, bisexual encounters, and casual sex. A detailed account of a sexual encounter in Central Park involving the hosts and a woman was shared, along with a story about a man trying to get his girlfriend to sleep with his friend. Numerous other sexually explicit stories were shared by the hosts and callers.  Callers Will and Charlotte discussed partner swapping and same-sex interactions within their open relationship, and caller Mike referenced a previous call about an orgy involving a bride. The segment ended with a discussion of a past radio appearance by one of the hosts, including a clip from a 1990 Bud Light comedy competition featuring crude jokes in a strong Jersey accent.

The final segment featured a comedian recounting embarrassing early career experiences, including his initial performance anxiety, his first masturbation experience (with a humorous anecdote about his mother interrupting him), a negative phone sex experience, and a stand-up routine about masturbation in church that was cut short by producers. He also discussed a short film, "Sidesplitters," made with Louis Black in 1999. The hosts concluded the show, promoting their Facebook page and air times.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I can't be partying to this. This is terrible.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is the worst kind of radio.  I think we're the only radio show that really tries to annoy our listeners.  The worst.  The worst, the better, I say.  It's a mess. Auditory diarrhea.  Oh, I have douche chills.  It's the opposite of fun.  Fuck them, them, them.  And now, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. Hello, how are you?  My name is E-Rock. E-Rock Radio on Twitter if you care to follow.  And go to the Opie and Anthony Facebook page. 
[00:00:30]  It's Opie and A-N-D Anthony on Facebook there.  Click like if you will.  And you can follow along with everything that we do every day on this show.  Worst of, they're off.  So what do we have for you?  Bob Kelly, Rich Voss, and Norton talking about their sex addictions.  We watch some black porn with Patrice and Louis C.K.  We reminisce about our days in high school and teachers and whatnot.  We play Guess That Sound.  I'll take you back to one of the predecessors for Jocktober. 
[00:01:00]  You're going to like this one.  But for right now, we start off with CTV Vancouver Island.  That's up in Canada, in case you didn't know.  For Anchorman, Andrew Johnson misused the word canoodling.  That's pretty much it.  I'll play the bit now.  All right, here's the canoodling video that a lot of people will be checking out today.  Anchorman, canoodling news blooper.  So you got this story in Canada.  What's the story about?  Some old lady's talking about how she's seen people canoodle in her neighborhood. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, it's just like some place where people used to hang out.  What is the actual definition of canoodling?  Canoodling is finger-popping?  It's heavy petting.  So that's finger-popping, right?  People that are canoodling are seen in like a club, like a booth in a club,  and they're secretly kind of nuzzling, snuggling, kissing.  Hands are groping a little bit.  I'll say a sexual cuddle.  No cocks out, though.  What about, so no digits going into dark places?  Nah.  Can you be heavy petting? 
[00:02:00]  Heavy petting.  Heavy petting?  Heavy petting.  Isn't petting and heavy petting the same thing?  I would think.  There's light petting.  What's light petting and what's heavy petting?  Heavy petting.  What an Ann Landers thing to say.  If your children are getting involved in heavy petting at this point,  you need to have a talk with them.  Do you know who Ann Landers is?  I know the name.  That's childhood.  Oh, man.  Child of the 80s stuff.  Oh, Jesus.  It's adult in the 80s because the memory is fully developed.  That's childhood in the 80s. 
[00:02:30]  I think light petting is like brushing your hand against the back.  Heavy petting is once you get to the breasts and vagina.  Oh, man.  You can't heavy pet on a vagina.  Over the pants.  Over the pants.  Vagina is heavy petting?  I don't know about that.  That's heavy.  This is heavy.  You do this move.  Jesus.  Scrunching it between your thumb and forefinger.  You're itching your scrotum.  Yeah.  Oh, what a great itch that is.  That is terrific.  Can we take time out to itch our scrotum, Sam? 
[00:03:00]  Absolutely.  If they're itchy, go ahead and scratch them.  It doesn't itch right now.  No.  Yeah, but it still feels good.  Not really, unless you have it.  Oh, yeah, it does.  Oh, yeah.  That feels really good.  Just roll it around a little.  Just roll that around in your mouth.  So we got this lady.  She's talking about canoodling in her neighborhood.  And I don't know.  I guess the anchor didn't really understand the actual definition of canoodling.  No, he gets a little confused.  What does he think canoodling is?  I guess he says it.  He says it, yeah.  Okay, so we don't need more of a setup than that.  No, we're done.  All right, here we go. 
[00:03:30]  Fought.  And then a lot of them brought their girlfriends out to, you know, canoodle or whatever.  Did people canoodle in Union Bay?  They did canoodle in Union Bay.  Well.  Which is a real good job.  Well, it's properly named, then.  Yeah.  Bruce Williams, CTV News, Union Bay.  Come on, everybody.  It's time now for a full look at your forecast with Astrid.  Astrid, maybe we can canoodle before you get into it about, um... 
[00:04:00]  We're not going to be canoodling.  What?  Oh, I thought canoodle meant chat.  You're not going to mean chat.  Astrid, you're lucky there's a producer in my ear.  I would have carried that on and on.  You know what?  You just made the blooper reel.  Good job, Andrew.  Take it away.  Get me off camera.  Oh, this is too much fun.  Uh, all right, let's completely switch gears.  Boy, she asked her there.  That chick does not like him.  Well, the best part, she gave the safe sign. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  But as in, no.  She's like, uh, we won't be canoodling.  And then she, yeah, took both of her hands and did, like, safe.  She was like, eh?  Like, that ain't happening.  My favorite part is when she goes, what?  Yeah.  Like, why would you bring this up?  Wow.  You think he really didn't know what the word was and somebody told him?  Or he thought he was being cute and charming and it totally backfired.  Maybe we'll canoodle it and he's waiting for her to go, yeah, okay.  And then she goes, oh, I don't even know what that means. 
[00:05:00]  Uh, I thought it meant, uh...  Oh.  Well, I'm hoping to give you a Roman war helmet later in the day.  Uh, what?  Isn't that just a hat?  I thought that was just some type of hat.  How do you not know that canoodling is, you know, something's going on.  Yeah, it's a little something.  It's definitely a good make-out session.  Nobody thinks it's chatting.  I was hoping, uh, I could teabag you a little later.  Uh, what? 
[00:05:30]  Excuse me, I'm getting something in my...  Oh, I thought that was just like have some tea.  A little tea party.  Oh, it's balls in your mouth.  Oh, while I'm dipping it with my heart on like the string.  Yes, no, that wasn't it.  I'm so sorry.  What about the rusty trombone?  I was hoping, before your weather forecast, you would give me, uh, what I call the rusty trombone.  Oh, I thought that was like a fanfare for when I come back.  Da-da-da-da!  Oh, oh, it's when you, uh, pucker up and blow into my ass while reaching around and jerking me off like a trombone. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, that's different.  You wanted to give her the dirty Sanchez, I thought.  The dirty Sanchez!  Oh, I thought that was, uh, the story about the, uh, landscapers that I was gonna get to.  After your weather.  I didn't know it was, uh, shoving a finger up your ass.  And then as I fuck you in the ass, reaching around and wiping the residual shit on my finger under your nose, making a mustache there in the dirty Sanchez. 
[00:06:30]  You know what, let's stop right there.  Has anyone actually done that?  No one has ever done any of those things.  The donkey punch, the fucking one-eyed pirate, the fucking...  I could see maybe the rusty trombone as a goof.  Cleveland steamer.  I could see the rusty trombone as a goof.  Yeah?  Yeah, why not?  Because girls...  Why not?  Because maybe with gay guys.  Because girls doing it, they don't have a sense of humor like that.  They don't?  No, to fucking shove their face in a guy's ass.  And you can't do it to a chick.  Right.  You could probably play the...  Maybe the rusty bagpipes with a girl. 
[00:07:00]  You just fucking...  You're tooting her ass, and then you work her pussy like fucking you're fingering the bagpipes.  I don't know, wait a minute.  Would that work?  Yeah.  I guess you're up to something.  The rusty flute?  No one has done the dirty Sanchez stop already.  No.  No.  Imagine doing that to a girl, and she's just like, ah, the dirty Sanchez!  Oh my god!  You roll!  You wipe shit under my nose!  Maybe because the holes are so close to each other, it'd be like the rusty harmonica.  But you're diddling your fingers on a harmonica. 
[00:07:30]  But you're pushing them in, and you could be...  I don't know, maybe a piccolo?  The rusty piccolo.  The rusty piccolo.  Well, that's too close to...  I don't know, but you've got to toot in her ass.  Right.  And then reach around and diddle a little like you're working...  So it's got to be a wind instrument, but you have to manipulate your fingers on the instrument.  But it's got to be small, and it can't be a slide like a trombone, because that's cock.  I don't know. 
[00:08:00]  I don't know.  Someone will figure it out.  Yeah, we'll get an answer to that.  Someone will figure it out.  The beauty of the show.  Rusty clarinet.  We've got an Alabama man on the phone, Matt.  Alabama man!  Matt.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, everyone.  Hey, I was just giggling about the canoodling story.  I used to be a weatherman on a television station in the southeast.  All right, prove it.  Prove it.  Give us 30 seconds of your horseshit.  Go ahead.  Go.  Good morning from the Channel 2 Weather Center, home of live TrueView Doppler radar. 
[00:08:30]  TrueView Doppler radar.  Why is it TrueView?  Enough of your stupid Dopplers.  Everyone has them now.  Everyone.  Stop trying to trick us with a fancy name for it.  That was always a humorous notion between all the other weather people.  But this was back in the early 2000s when Austin Powers decided to shag me.  It was the Monday after that movie hit the box office, and we had a news anchor who didn't 
[00:09:00]  know what shagged.  I was standing there about to do the weather forecast, and her talk to me was, and now  let's go to the weatherman who shagged us all.  And then she pitched over for the weather forecast, and I just had this blank stare.  Clearly, you don't know what that means.  It was just a funny moment.  It reminded me of the canoodling incident in Canada.  Are you in the business?  No, I'm out of the business now. 
[00:09:30]  So you can be honest.  Anchor people are the dumbest people alive, right?  Yeah, well, for the most part.  I work with some good ones, but there are some airheads out there for sure.  A bunch of airheads that just read very well.  Yeah, they're really good readers.  And a lot of them are really easy on the eyes, too, of course.  Oh, wow.  That's why they're hired.  Easy on the eyes.  See, rar, rar, rar, rar, rar.  Good to have fun.  Enjoy the show.  Yeah, you too.  Why not? 
[00:10:00]  Why not?  Well, we got an answer to your rusty thing.  Oh, right.  Scott in Detroit.  I don't even know what this thing is.  Really?  I'm just hoping this is correct.  Scott, go ahead.  Yeah, a rusty ocarina.  It's a little flute-like thing with little fingering things.  Ocarina.  Kind of like a whistle.  Is that that round thing, kind of?  Yeah, kind of.  It could be kind of oblong.  It's got a few fingering holes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I see.  Just like a lady.  I've seen that.  An ocarina.  Yeah, right.  I'm going to harp on this for 8,000 fucking times. 
[00:10:30]  Let's look at the ocarina.  Oh, man.  That don't look like no pussy.  It looks like a fucking...  I don't know.  Like a fucking...  You need like a...  Yeah, watch someone playing it, though.  It looks like a pipe or a...  Yeah, it's still...  You can put your weed in it.  It's still cock-like.  Yeah.  We're looking for something that is more pussy-like.  Like a vagina.  Right.  All right.  Well, you know, best I could do.  Fuck it, A.  He's all mad.  All right, E-Rock. 
[00:11:00]  Jesus.  Yeah, E-Rock, relax.  Jeez.  Just having fun at your expense.  No, that's stupid now.  I think it's dumb.  Now that we see the YouTube video, that's just dumb.  No.  That thing looks...  Who plays that?  Yeah, I'm really good.  What does this sound like? 
[00:11:30]  You know what that says?  I could do the same fucking thing with my tootie whistle horn thing.  But that says the sun is coming up in an area you should not be in.  Yes.  Ah, see, that's good.  You wouldn't feel threatened if you heard that music.  Yeah.  Give me the sound of where you would be threatened with the sun coming up. 
[00:12:00]  There you go.  Yeah.  It's very scary.  And here's the Chinese.  Just notes.  I don't know why they do it.  Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot 
[00:12:30]  The Worst of the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:13:00]  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the Worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  It's the Worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock, and I'm going to take you back to last year, 2012,  when we did a segment talking about cats, big and small.  Everything from your typical house cat up to bobcats, cougars, mountain lions, all that stuff.  And in light of Anthony recently stating that he wants to get a cat,  in this particular segment, you hear early signs that he really wanted to get a cat a long time ago. 
[00:13:30]  Here it is, cats big and small and whatever, on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Look at the bobcat.  Oh my god.  I thought it was the comedian.  I lay here, I meow.  Dude, you got your litter box, you got your fucking paws.  Oh my paw, man.  Why don't we get the cats in anymore?  Look how cute that thing is.  That's a very pretty cat.  Oh my god. 
[00:14:00]  But if the squawk box got it, why don't we have it?  Exactly.  Is that a bobcat?  Yeah, it's a bobcat.  I would fucking just pet it.  Isn't that thing cool?  It just looks like a giant house cat.  That thing would really pound you.  Oh, imagine playing with it, like you play with a cat and he scratches you.  It does that thing where it rolls over on its back, grabs you with the front claws,  and then does that high speed rear claw fucking shred thing.  Imagine that doing it.  You think that would hurt?  Holy fuck, your arm would be gone.  You'd be holding shredded hamburger meat.  I've seen regular cats that big, though.  So how do you know the difference? 
[00:14:30]  No, no, no.  Look at that one.  That's a big fucking...  I've seen cats almost that big.  I'm telling you.  That is just a beautiful aminal.  You know what, dude?  The dog's chasing you.  You go...  I'm a bobcat, dude.  I think the compound needs some exotic pets.  Exotic pets would be cool.  That would be great.  If you had a tiger chained up in your backyard, like Scarface...  I got a tiger chained up out there.  Look, let me show you.  And then I fucking swagger over.  Take it to the limit.  Yeah, take it to the limit.  Something like a four-inch chain. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  You have tiger had no room to move in, tiger.  I mean, you got...  That's my tiger.  You already have Daniel Craig naked in your pool, but then you got exotic pets.  No, he wasn't naked in my pool.  Now you're talking.  Exotic pets would be cool.  Now that's a compound.  Exotic pets.  I want a small, big cat.  Like a bobcat, it'd be cool.  Something like that.  Not a big tiger or a lion.  That's just too much.  They'll just eat your face eventually.  Oh, of course they will.  I don't want an alligator.  Yeah, you should have one alligator in the pool. 
[00:15:30]  In the pool?  That'd be fucking awesome.  That would be kind of cool to have an alligator in my pool.  A little one.  Okay, one alligator in the pool.  It's going to bite, but it's not going to like...  And then every now and then the alligator would come out of the pool, like in Florida.  Yeah, it just suns itself on the deck and stuff.  That'd be fucking cool shit.  Oh, let's get you an alligator for this spring.  I want a monkey.  I want a monkey.  Yeah, yeah.  They throw shit everywhere.  No, no, I would love to have a monkey, though.  But they throw shit everywhere.  I'd love to own a monkey.  Oh.  No, they were fucking cool.  I'd dress them up in an engineer, a train engineer suit with the suspenders and the coveralls 
[00:16:00]  and the little engineer hat.  And a diaper because they just shit.  Yeah, you know, you teach them to fucking farm.  Can you imagine having to change a diaper?  A monkey diaper so hairy?  Oh, my God.  Throwing them with four limbs?  I wouldn't do it.  I'd have a fucking live-in housekeeper and fix care of the monkey.  Yeah.  Change my monkey's diaper, you fucking bitch.  That's what I'm saying?  That's what I'm telling you.  Why wouldn't you be polite?  Change my monkey's shitty diaper. 
[00:16:30]  Don Lemon would be so pissed at you if you treated him like that.  You're supposed to get a Savannah cat.  A Savannah cat?  And I want to get an African, uh, is it an African tortoise?  Ah, a bunch of listeners.  Will they move even slower?  Jesus.  I want a pet for my son, and they're suggesting, I think it was the African tortoise.  Yeah?  But then you've got to worry about Salmonella.  What?  Really?  I think so, yeah.  From a tortoise?  Yeah, you've got to worry about that shit.  So I don't want to bring Salmonella into my house willingly. 
[00:17:00]  Salmonella.  But that's what they said with the turtles and the tortoises.  You've got to worry about that shit.  Is that true?  And is it the African tortoise?  That's your new cat.  Is that the Savannah cat?  Yeah.  See, I said I've seen cats as big as bobcats.  There you go.  The Savannah cat.  Where'd you see a Savannah cat?  But those are little kids like near them.  Let me say hi to Pa John.  Pa John.  Or Pennsylvania John?  What are you, John?  P.A. John.  P.A. John. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Fair enough.  That means you talk loudly in public.  Yeah.  Hey, the Savannah cat.  And that's what you need to get.  The F1 is the one you need to get.  The F1?  What's the F1?  Well, there's different sizes, different prices.  Anthony definitely needs to go for the F1.  Is F1 like it's 75%, 25%?  Is that like how you judge them?  Yeah, something like that.  Like a certain amount of cat and a certain amount of something else. 
[00:18:00]  Like they have animals where, oh my God.  Oh God.  That is so adorable.  Savannah kitten.  That could be the cutest thing on the internet right there.  How big do they get, Savannah cats?  20 feet long.  Oh, I would have thought smaller.  No.  That's big.  This is Dr. Steve's co-host, I'm being told.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  The voice just isn't as recognizable as Dr. Steve's.  Oh, he's going to tweet you like John Lemon did.  Yeah, the Savannah cat. 
[00:18:30]  So what's up with the Savannah cats?  Do they rip your eyes out when you're sleeping at night?  Apparently they're supposed to be like a dog.  You take them for walks on a leash.  They're very gentle.  That's what I'm reading about them.  We're looking at, hold on.  Yeah, we're looking at pictures of the Savannah cat for the people out there, and they're  on their hind legs, and they're about four feet tall.  Their hind legs.  When they're standing like that.  Is that considered a house cat or a wild one?  That's a house cat. 
[00:19:00]  It's got to fuck you up.  If a regular cat fucks you up, a Savannah cat's going to fuck you up pretty good.  Yeah.  I'm assuming if you piss it off, yeah.  True.  Yeah, but you don't even know what you do wrong with these stupid cats.  I had cats.  That fucking thing.  They're lunatics.  That's crazy.  It's as big as a kid.  Didn't you have cats that just fucking would be in a bad mood out of nowhere?  A Siamese cat named Jade was crazy.  You could do everything perfect, and it still has a problem with you.  It was the nastiest fucking cat.  Siamese cats are crazy anyway. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  With them big, crazy blue eyes who would just look and charge out at you.  You'd walk down the hallway and would just charge out at your ankle.  Ah!  You're being stalked in your own house.  It's wonderful.  Don't you yell at the cat?  Like, don't you realize I'm feeding you, you ass?  What are you doing?  I'm the guy.  You stupid fuck.  But these are obviously nice.  It looks like they're nice.  Cats are not nice.  Yeah, my cat looks nice, but he'll just walk up to you, and then he'll kind of nuzzle you  a little bit.  And then swipe at you.  Not swipe. 
[00:20:00]  He jumps at me, and he grabs my arm with his two claws and then just chomps his teeth in.  Oh, who has a Savannah cat?  No, it's not a Savannah cat.  Just his regular cat.  Why don't you just throw it outside?  Well, I throw him off the couch, but he's a sweet guy.  I would declaw it and put it out in the wild.  Why would you declaw it and then put it out in the wild?  Just show him who's boss.  You want to get a lesson taught to you, cat?  Yeah.  You want to be a tough guy?  Well, good luck out in the wild without claws, you asshole.  I was the one feeding you.  Yeah, that's exactly what I would do.  And you'd just be sitting there scratched up all day like, I shouldn't have fucking scratched 
[00:20:30]  that guy.  Why would you scratch the person that's taking care of you?  I know.  It can't get its own food in your house.  You have to give it the food.  Plus cuddles.  They also, they are compared to dogs and loyalty.  That was true.  And they can be trained to walk on a leash and even fetch.  And a lot of them are reported to be social and friendly with new people.  While others may run and hide or revert to hissing and growling.  It depends on exposure to people and pets when they're kittens.  And this is an often noted trait.  They can jump very high.  Some can jump eight feet from the standing position. 
[00:21:00]  Are you talking about cats or the retarded?  The retarded Savannah cats.  They bark.  They say many of them don't fear.  Oh, they also, they're so cute.  They're very inquisitive and have been known to get into all sorts of things.  They often learn how to open doors and cupboards.  And anyone buying a Savannah will likely need to take special precautions to prevent the  cat from getting into things.  Oh.  They're inquisitive.  Oh, hi, I'm a cat.  What is this? 
[00:21:30]  Oh, is this a dresser drawer?  Oh, is this a chest of drawers?  Where's my cat treats?  Oh, there they are.  I'll get them.  They're very inquisitive.  Very inquisitive.  How are you?  What are you doing here?  What's your relationship with my owner?  What's in your parents' house?  They're busy bodies.  They really are.  They're nosy bodies.  Fuck you, you nosy body. 
[00:22:00]  Get your own fucking cat food.  I had four cats in my life and one was cool.  And the other three were assholes.  Meow, you're tears away.  Meow, you're tears away.  Anne had a cool cat, too.  We talk about JD every once in a while.  JD.  It was an amazing cat.  It would play fetch and shit.  JD and he's dead now.  And the rest of the cats were assholes, right?  For the most part?  Yeah, yeah.  The rest of them, yeah.  Oh, no.  No. 
[00:22:30]  Suspended for cuteness.  For adorableness pictures.  Oh, boy.  Crazy.  Well, thanks, PA John.  You guys have a good day.  Yeah.  You can't own them in the city of New York.  What?  You can't own them in the state.  Savannas are more than five generations.  Wait, that are more.  Savannas more than five generations from the Serval are allowed to be owned in New York State,  but not in the city of New York.  I guess that from the Serval means five generations removed from the wild, I'm guessing, or hybrid. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, Dr. Steve tweeted me about that.  Yeah, Savannas cats, very adorable, leaps very high.  F1 is the hybrid generation number.  F1, the first generation after breeding between two species.  Oh, so those are the ones you probably can own in F5.  In New York State, but not the city.  The one that's closest.  Yeah.  Like, a lot of times, the F1 of my wine would be grapes and urine. 
[00:23:30]  That's the F1.  It's the closest generation.  Then you water it down with things like liquid feces and honey and liquefied toenail clippings.  That doesn't sound very good at all.  Oh, no!  What's it doing?  Well, that's a sphinx kitten.  That's so cool.  It's a cat in the water.  But he's in a tub.  Is that a fucking kangaroo?  He's in a tub.  He's standing on his hind legs.  But then he's doggy paddling with his front paws.  Oh, he has no fucking heart. 
[00:24:00]  How does he have cancer?  No, he doesn't.  No, he's a sphinx.  A sphinx?  Does he have cancer?  It's a cat with cancer.  Oh, no.  How cute!  I just want to fucking kiss him.  Oh, that's adorable.  He's just frolicking in the water.  Fucking kangaroo creepy cancer kangaroo cat.  Hop, I'm sick!  Hop, I'm sick!  Fucking hop, cough, hop, cough.  How big do those sphinx cats get?  Just like, I think, regular cat size, pretty much.  I want to have a cat again. 
[00:24:30]  You had one?  I grew up with cats.  That generation thing is...  My cat is a first-generation feral cat.  Like, his mom was just on the street.  What does that mean, a feral?  Oh, whoa.  And so now he bites and he doesn't clean his asshole.  You have a cat that doesn't clean his own asshole?  Why don't you get in there and do it?  That's all cats do.  They eat and clean their asshole.  He doesn't clean his asshole.  Enough, I should say.  Oh, no.  Why do you have this thing?  Huh?  Why do you have this thing?  I like him.  His name's Bruiser Brody.  You don't really like him.  I do like him.  And it attacks you.  I want to know about...  Yeah, with a shit ass. 
[00:25:00]  He bites you and has a shitty caked asshole.  What if we take a little wet nap and help him out?  Oh, God.  You clean your cat's asshole?  Why have an animal you got to do that to?  He must love that.  Fuck that.  Does he hate it?  Yeah, yeah, he does.  He hates it.  You got to pin him down?  Yeah, you got to...  Lift his tail and wipe his asshole with the fucking wet nap?  You got to hold him, but he knows that I...  Oh, I'm sure he'll suck on the wet nap.  I'm sure he doesn't try to claw at you as you clean his asshole.  No.  What a nightmare.  He knows that I'm his dad and, you know, we take care of him. 
[00:25:30]  We had a Manx cat with the little short tails.  Those are the best because they don't have to swoop over the asshole.  Yeah.  The little short stubby tail.  Did you like growing up with cats?  I did.  Jama's my favorite.  Jess always makes him...  Jess always says,  Say a paper towel, paper towel.  Because he goes and he walks up to her lap and wants to sit down.  And sometimes he'll sit down on Jess and on her pajama pants.  And then he'll get up and there's a little cat turd staying.  Jesus fucking Christ.  I know.  I bet she likes when he makes the little cat biscuits.  That's probably why my mother used to say the cat was making biscuits. 
[00:26:00]  When it's kneading.  He's making biscuits.  Is that why she claws him onto her lap?  When Sam's not getting the job done, she's like,  Come here, make some biscuits.  He doesn't knead on her vagina.  And that would be painful.  He's got claws.  Yeah, we leave shit stains on her...  First of all, what kind of PJs does she wear?  With legs?  Yeah, like pajama pants.  Why would you allow that in the house?  Just like as it's like...  So she doesn't get shit on her leg.  That's fine.  Those are lounging around.  Like, after work, she'll come home and put pajamas on.  And that's not necessarily what she sleeps in.  How did you get a fucking feral cat at the Humane Society? 
[00:26:30]  Meow, meow, shake it up.  Shake it up, meow.  Scott feral cat.  Yeah, Scott feral cat.  Why did you choose one that was fucking wild?  Because it was cheap.  Yeah, yeah.  What, you pay five bucks for it?  Like free kittens or something.  Oh, you want for the free kittens?  He was an adorable kitten.  That's never gonna go.  Oh, my God.  All-star are adorable.  They trick us.  So they shitty ass bite you.  Big paws and blue eyes.  Dude, they trick you with their cuteness.  Why does he pause?  Why does he just get to it?  And even their nails don't hurt when they're kittens. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  Fast forward a year and they're a nightmare for everybody.  Their cures as kittens until they grow up and their tail rolls back and they put shit  on your pajamas.  I'll never put on pajama bottoms again.  No wet nap had been sent.  I like him, but Jess gets really frustrated with him.  Like, because when we'll have...  Yes, she does.  ...Ope's kid over or whatever, like when the family comes by, she has to watch him.  Like, and we have to lock the cat up because obviously, you know, Ope's kid will want to 
[00:27:30]  go and pet the cat, but we don't really trust that he won't jump up and bite him.  What the fuck are you doing with that?  But he's a good, he's a good boy.  No, it's not.  And he throws up like four times, five times a week.  The hairball thing where it's...  No, he goes, he's a big, fat cat.  He's a giant, fat cat.  I'm an executive!  And he goes and he stuffs his face with cat food and then he walks away from his dish  and throws up.  He's an idiot.  You have a horrid cat. 
[00:28:00]  He's a great cat, though.  He's fun.  He's a terrible cat.  He's got personality.  It's over, Johnny.  Personality.  Do you know what?  That stinks.  When I was little, I used to say that my cat didn't have personality.  He had catnality.  He was very cute of me.  Oh, fuck.  I was saying to my mother, does John have catnality?  Young Jimmy's getting less and less cute as the years go on.  You don't think that's cute?  No.  Do you think your mom fast forwarded a few years and realized that the catnality kid would 
[00:28:30]  still be living in her house bringing prostitutes home?  No, she probably didn't understand the juxtaposition of those two people.  You have tranny-ality.  You know, sticking with the formula.  I understand.  We all got it.  It's just John have catnality.  You just like making it hurt a little more.  Of course.  Does our cat have catnality?  No.  Okay, good.  I'm going to go sniff a girl's panties who's pissed herself.  Stressed that girl had fucking...  So Jess hates the cat, right? 
[00:29:00]  Jess is not as big a Bruiser Brody fan as I am.  But give her the cat.  Bruiser Brody.  It's time.  No, she wanted the cat.  Your mom will take care of the cat.  No, she's already got it.  In its old age.  Meaning the cat's old age.  So give her the cat and be done with it.  I'm Bruiser Brody.  I'm Bruiser Brody.  You get a pet.  You don't just...  If it acts bad, you don't give it away.  You pet.  You get a pet.  How many years did you give it?  We've had him for four years.  You could fucking get rid of him.  Exactly.  That's right.  Four years.  You gave it a fair chance.  I want those beaches open, Bruiser Brody. 
[00:29:30]  Me and my ex had a couple cats and we went on a quick vacation and we got home and the  cat was gone and she lost her shit and I went, oh, that sucks.  Anyway, what do you want for dinner?  Did you ever find it?  I didn't go looking for it.  No.  But she certainly did.  Never found it?  I brought the animal back.  Where was it?  I don't know.  Somewhere in the neighborhood.  I couldn't be bothered.  Bruiser Brody's got a tag with our phone number on it and he doesn't even leave the house.  Why don't we break? 
[00:30:00]  We got a...  Bruiser Brody's a cunt.  He has a shit smelling cunt.  Shitty ass rotten fucking animal.  Does it just smell like shit when it's near you?  No, no, no.  He doesn't.  We make sure that he's a hygienic guy.  We'll brush him and like I said, use a little wet nap to make sure he's clean.  Do you teach it by, you know, licking your own asshole to show him?  You know, you gotta fucking clean your asshole.  I always just lift up his tail and lick it myself and say, now you.  That's good.  I guarantee Pat Duffy would lick your cat's asshole.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Get him in here.  Pat would.  Do you know, we ought to get you a cat ant.  Why?  Called Boozer Brody.  Oh, I get it.  Oh, I get it.  Oh.  Right.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  XM.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock.  You can follow me on E-Rock Radio on Twitter if you want. 
[00:31:00]  And the show on Facebook, Opie and Anthony.  Opie, Ann, and Jim have their own Twitters.  You can find them somewhere.  Just search it and it's really easy to find.  In this segment here, for the worst of, because they're not here today.  Digging back a bit, going back to, geez, I don't even know what year.  Probably 2007, I'll say.  Eric and Kathy.  A married radio team, or so we thought, from WTMX, The Mix, in Chicago.  This is one of the early predecessors to us establishing Jocktober, 
[00:31:30]  where we would review shows for how lackluster and uncreative they are,  reusing the same bits from city to city to city.  Ah, this can't be good.  A guy and a girl team never really fares out well for morning radio.  They're everywhere, but they're not that good.  This is an example of it.  Eric and Kathy on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Married radio team on the Today Show.  This first clip describes their little thing as an affair without the sex. 
[00:32:00]  Ah, that's pretty cool, right?  All the trunciness without the load.  This is so much better than talking about Opie and Anthony and all that controversy they caused.  Well, for better or for worse, a lot of men and women are forging these marriage-like relationships in the workplace.  And you can find them just about anywhere, from the halls of, say, morning television, to the executive suite,  to right here in Chicago on the radio.  Report on the workers. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, I see what they're doing.  They're doing a story on, yeah, where guys go to work,  and they kind of have this relationship with some chick at the office, but there's no sex.  But they have an ongoing relationship, they flirt with each other, and this and that.  Right, okay.  Maybe do a little lunch or do a coffee break together, because they work together.  They work together, and they spend just as much time with that person as they do with their significant other.  So they build up this relationship that is almost like a marriage.  Some of these have been going on for 20 years, 30 years. 
[00:33:00]  Or 12 years, like you and I.  Right.  Anthony and I having an affair without the sex right here in front of your eyes.  Well, it's because one of us doesn't want to.  And they said, like, uh...  I forgot my thought.  Oh!  All right.  Jesus.  I had a thought and it went bye-bye.  So that's the, uh...  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  So that's the setup.  Yeah.  And I think there is a lot of people out there that can relate to this. 
[00:33:30]  And they also, they found this on morning radio.  Yeah.  Because a lot of guys are forced to work with a broad.  A broad on the radio.  A hole.  And instead of it just being a working relationship, they have to make something of it like it's, you know, something special.  Right.  Hey!  I saw one of those news shows about this whole relationship thing at work.  And, uh, this was an older guy, an older woman.  And I swear they were acting like an old married couple.  Like, just with the little jabs back and forth. 
[00:34:00]  And, okay, I'll help you with that, Susie.  And, you know, he's helping.  And he, like, shopped for her and brought in what she needed the next day.  Like a hen-pecked husband.  Oh, they're all out there, man.  Yeah.  Let's talk about morning teams where it's a guy and a gal, man.  They're all over the place.  And the crap they do.  Yeah.  Ugh.  And there's some innocent flirting going on.  Like, if they weren't married, they'd be banging each other.  All that crap.  One of the funniest guy-girl jokes ever. 
[00:34:30]  This is an Otto and George joke.  He was a Star Search joke.  And he goes, I hate that every dance team is, uh, some uptight Manhattan bitch and a gay Puerto Rican.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Cunt and Hernandez.  Fucking Otto.  When's Otto coming back?  Oh, he's a funny dude, man.  All right.  Cunt and Hernandez. 
[00:35:00]  They're making the clips of the walkover from today.  Ah, good.  There was a mob scene out there, and the video will be up on opianthony.com shortly.  Okay.  Radio, uh, married radio team.  I'll go on the radio.  Well, the workers often spend more time with each other than at home.  The result?  Many are saying, I do, to an office spouse.  Aw.  Hello.  Hello.  It's a purely platonic corporate coupling.  No love connection or exchange of rings. 
[00:35:30]  What do you think I should do?  The Mix.  It's 841 with Eric and Kathy.  Kathy and Eric make...  Ah!  Eric and Kathy!  Ah!  I'd rather listen to Joel and Hedda.  Eric and Kathy.  Are they even right now?  Apparently they're off, I guess.  I'd rather listen to Scott and Lacey.  This is the Nicole and OJ show. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, God.  That sounds simply horrific.  Welcome to Chambers and Levin' in the morning.  Well, they got the Daily Dose of Eric and Kathy.  I'm on their website.  Oh, great.  Give it to me.  Give me all the info you can on these people.  The Daily Dose, I guess it's a feature they do every day.  The Daily Dose of Eric and Kathy.  Today's dose dated a crazy woman.

You can check out Kathy's blog here.  Oh, great.  And Cynthia's crush of the week.  Who's Cynthia?  Some other hole on the shelf.  Probably some fucking...  She's probably the wacky one who says what we're all thinking.  Which if that was true, she would just go,  I'm a cunt, I'm a cunt, I'm a cunt.  Crush of the week.  Crush of the week. 
[00:37:30]  Support the Eric and Kathy bike to work challenge.  Ah, the bike to work challenge.  These two are doing good for society.  Eric and Kathy are gearing up for their bike to work challenge.  Help support their quest to bike for the far reaches of the suburbs to the Prudential Plaza.  I'd have tuned in, but I listen to the Adolph and Ava show every morning.  One of my personal favorites.  I only want to hear the crush of the week if it's about a steamroller who drinks a lot and works near a school. 
[00:38:00]  What else?  I'm Eric and I'm Kathy.  Eric and Kathy.  Are you?  Oh, God.  Their names alone.  Why is that combination of names so completely awful?  Because they're both fucking just benign white person names.  Welcome to the Eric and Kathy show.  I'm Eric.  Good news.  Yes, good news.  Eric and Kathy have a message board.  Oh, they don't.

Baby doll.  But they're calling it the passion name instead of porn. 
[00:39:00]  Wait, are they?  It's the old radio gag.  What's your porn name?  And you take the street you grew up on.  And you show that to that bit is.  I bet you.  I didn't even click on it yet, but I'm going to.  All right, go ahead.  So, remember that bit?  It's like, what's your porn star?  So, you take the name of the street you grew up on.  And your first pet, I guess?  Your pet's name, yeah.  So, mine would be Fresca Maine.  Ah.  What a faggity name.  Mine is John Linwood.  See?  That's good.  John Linwood is a very good porn name. 
[00:39:30]  Wait, exactly.  My cat's name was John.  Jesus.  What about you?  Every radio show in America has done this one.  The street name and pet, Elwynn Champ.  Oh, that's really good.  You sound like an unclipped Guatemalan porn star.  I'm Elwynn Champ.  Elwynn Champ, and I'm going to fuck you.  I'm going to fuck you with my four, my two.  Elwynn Champ.  Elwynn Champ.  The fan from The Walk is back.  Want him up, yes.

Oh, yeah.  What show?  Eric and Kathy.  Eric and Kathy, line five.  Why would we want to listen to that?  Put it on.  I want Eric and Kathy.  Opie's having a nervous breakdown, and we need to do the show.  Oh, sorry.  Yes, they want that fan.  All right, let's go to Rob in Chicago.  Yeah, bring that fag up here.  Hey, Rob.  Hey, we're out.  Rob.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  How are you doing, man?  We've got to listen to Eric and Kathy.

I want to talk about fun stuff, Opie.  Well, yeah.  Okay, what's the bet?

There's an American.  You can strap this to your chest and go talk to them.  Oh, my God.  Talk like an Egyptian.  Don't walk like an Egyptian. 
[00:41:30]  Talk like one.  See your name or whatever in hieroglyphics.  Oh, wow.  Oh, fucking Eric and Cassie.  That is a fun sight.  Really know how to fucking just make your whole weekend crazy.  Wow.  Hieroglyphics at midnight.  Hold on.  I'm wrong about the passion game.  Oh, you are.  During the throes of passion, your significant other may forget your actual name.  To see what names they will give you in the heat of the moment, enter your real name below.  Oh, try it.  All righty. 
[00:42:00]  Putting Greg with two Gs.  My name is Greg with two Gs.  G-G-R-E-G.  See, we need hundreds of people outside Free FM every morning and to get this kind of adrenaline.  Yeah.  Because we all thought we were going to die.  Do you know what my passion name was?  My passion name was, get off me.  All right.  Hey, hey.  I'm putting in Greg Hughes.  How long does it take to compute?  It's computing right now.  Come on.  Sorry.  That was terrible.  The big Eric and Cassie master computer is at work as we speak. 
[00:42:30]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Eric and Cassie.  Cassie.  Yeah, keep us posted on this show.  That combination of names for a radio show is infuriating.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, okay.  What's your passion name?  Wow, Greg Hughes.  It seems when your lover is going for the blue ribbon, he, she will be calling you Quiet  Substitute.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!

That's my secret name for myself.  Wow, Jim Norton.  It seems when your lover is going for the blue ribbon, he, she will be calling you,  you should be grateful game player.  Ah! 
[00:44:00]  I just like the fact that it says he, she.  Why he, she?  Anthony?  Someone said they did mine already and it came out Joseph Goebbels.  All right.  Well, it's called put yellow numbers on their arms.  We're computing for Anthony.  We're computing for Anthony.  Your old thumbs up, thumbs down at the box car.  We're computing for Anthony Cumia.  Oh. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, what happened?  Wow, Anthony Cumia.  It seems when your lover is going for the blue ribbon.  What the fuck is the blue ribbon?  It's when you're fucking a pig.  You want to make sure that it's like a blue ribbon winner?  Going for the blue ribbon.  Going for the big orgasm.  The finish.  The big first prize.  Why do they call it the blue ribbon?  The blue ribbon.  Because they can't say coming.  Well, how about when you're...  Because they can't say loads in your face.  The Eric and Kathy show.  They can't be doing that.  Can they find another euphemism?  Can they use another euphemism?  When you're about to repress that kid's memories. 
[00:45:00]  All right, here we go.  Wow, Anthony Cumia.  It seems when your lover is going for the blue ribbon.  He, she...  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  I fucked up.  Wow, Anthony Cumia.  Eric would have gotten it right.  It seems when your lover is going for the blue...  The blue ribbon.  It's a sandwich with fucking sauerkraut.  Wow, Anthony Cumia.  Take three.  It seems when your lover is going...  Blue ribbon. 
[00:45:30]  He needed the money.  Wow, Anthony Cumia.  It seems when your lover is going for the blue ribbon.  He will be calling you insane enchanter.  Oh!  What does that mean?  You're not an insane enchanter.  I know he said he.  Like I cared.  It took me three times to get that bit together.  I know.  I'm such a loser.  It's all right.  What is an insane enchanter?  Insane enchanter.  That's cool.  What level am I? 
[00:46:00]  It's like an EverQuest character.  I'm an insane enchanter.  Level 16.  Back to Rob in Chicago.  Rob.  They're on.  They're playing like the wacky match game.

[00:49:30]  So anyway, let's get back to this, this married work day.  This is Eric and Kathy.  Yeah.  I start all over.  So basically, it's, you know, you go to work, and then you get to know someone of the opposite sex,  and it's like kind of, it's kind of like an affair without the sex.  Yeah.  It's all the rage in the workplace, including on the radio.  Relationship.  Well, for better or for worse, a lot of men and women are forging these marriage-like relationships in the workplace,  and you can find them just about anywhere, from the halls of, say, morning television, to the executive suite, 
[00:50:00]  to right here in Chicago on the radio.  The workers often spend more time with each other than at home.  The result, many are saying, I do, to an office spouse.  Hello.  Hello.  It's a purely platonic corporate coupling, no love connection or exchange of rings.  What do you think I should do?  What do you think I should do?  The Mix, it's 841 with Eric and Kathy. 
[00:50:30]  Kathy and Eric may be Chicago's most famous couple.  It's like having an affair without really having one.  Together for a decade, their faces are everywhere.  Are they?  Yeah, people think all the time that we're married.  And they are, just not to each other.  Sometimes it seems like it on their morning radio show.  This kind of gets lost in the old...  It just doesn't seem like it's the appropriate place.  Of course.  Oh, God.  Clowns. 
[00:51:00]  I don't even need to know what they were talking about.  The perfect whole response.  That is textbook whole.  What is this?  Is this part of their thing?  Eric and Kathy stuff.  I like this.  All right.  I don't think, from Carson appropriate response, I don't think, I'm Kathy.  Stupid Kathy.  They are arguing with the Kathy show.  Oh, they got six ways to tell your girl to lose some weight.  Oh.  Please.  Please be good.  Six ways to tell your girl to lose some weight. 
[00:51:30]  Number one.  Throw a harpoon into her cunt.  Jesus.  Jimmy.  I'm just going by the Eric and Kathy show.  Three words.  Punch in jaw.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Mix dog shit into her food.  Can we please start our own...  Can we please start our own version of this on whackbag.com?  I think we have already.  All right.  How to tell your chick she's too fat?  The fan had a gem.  Number two. 
[00:52:00]  Data Haitian.  Six ways to tell your girl to lose some weight.  According to Eric and Kathy, they're just blowing up there in Chicago.  Yeah, faces are everywhere.  Number one, but it's right.  Except for each other's crotch.  That's right.  Because they're not married.  Certainly on the back end of horses.  Number one, it's in no particular order here.  I don't like the way that outfit looks on you anymore.  Every woman has a go-to get-up.  If you don't know it, you don't know her well enough to discuss her flabby stomach. 
[00:52:30]  The only thing that could ever change the way an outfit looks is the way it fits.  Tell her you aren't sure why it looks odd.  Suggest a looser knit and watch her forever skip the nachos with cheese.  Nachos with cheese.  Suggest a looser knit.  If you suggest something looser for your wife or chick, she's going to be like...  She's just going to say, okay, and not ask why.  Am I fat?  Right.  And then you got the fat argument.  What's the suggestion again?  What's the first way they wore it? 
[00:53:00]  If you don't...  Every woman has a go-to get-up?  No, no, no.  I don't like the way that outfit looks on you anymore.  Number two...  How about phrasing it differently?  Like, you know, when you'd wear that, I used to want to fuck you.  Now I just want to yell pig and cut your throat.  What does he mean?  Six ways to tell your girl to lose some weight.  Here's another suggestion.  Right?  I can't get over how fat I feel.  Women have been commiserating with each other for enos about the thickness of their eons. 
[00:53:30]  Eons, eons, eons, eons!  Enos.  Enos.  I mean...  Wow.  That was a good one.  I caught myself barely.  Come on.  I just can't believe that I did that.  I am such an idiot. 
[00:54:00]  Yes, I am.  Women have been commiserating...  For many enos, we have been here.  With each other for eons about the thickness of their thighs.  If you launch a pity party of your own about how heavy you feel and let her know at every turn,  she'll become fat-obsessed by osmosis.  Women have been doing it to each other since the dawn of public washroom.  So you say you're fat.  Yeah.  And could keep complaining about how fat you're getting.  And then your chick will be like, hey, uh-oh, maybe I should, you know... 
[00:54:30]  That's the only word if you go, geez, I feel fat.  Another few months, I'm going to look like you.  Six ways to tell your girl to lose some weight.  Here's another suggestion for the fellas out there.  Your friend isn't nearly as attractive since she gained that weight.  Your friend...  Oh, so bring it up to a friend.  And you're like, hey, your friend is fat.  Be careful.  And she'll be like, uh-oh.  Yeah, but then your woman...  Yeah.  Then she's going to think you want to bang her friend, you idiot. 
[00:55:00]  Right, right.  That you've been looking at her and noticing she's gaining weight.  These are the worst fucking ideas.  You know what?  You hold up a picture of Karen Carpenter and say, look at this fat cunt.  Or when your spouse is leaving the house, you just go, hey, take care.  Lead the rape whistle.  You won't need it.  And you'll probably eat it anyway.  Guys, six ways to tell your girl to lose some weight.  Here's another suggestion if you're listening out there.  I have a new female trainer at the gym. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, now you're going to be looking at an in-shape woman at the gym, and she's going to feel threatened.  Guys, they used the word bonkers.  Let me...  Wait a minute.  Okay.  Let me go here.  I'm glad you said that, because I haven't had to use my seatbelt here in the studio in quite a while.  I have to buckle up.  All right.  Here we go.  She'll never suggest fewer trips to the gym, but it will drive her bonkers to think that another woman is spotting your squat thrusts. 
[00:56:00]  I hope bonkers means an abutment on a highway, and that's where she's driving.  She'll sign up and show up within 24 hours just to keep an eye on you.  Oh.  Oh.  Guys, six ways to tell your girl to lose some weight.  I hope you got your own suggestions out there for whackbag.com.  The saleswoman said it was for smaller women.  Oh, wait.

Maybe E-Rock's cunt pits will be posting something.  That would be WTMX.com.  Guys, if you want your baby to shed some baby fat, spend a couple of bucks on a nice little fashion piece a couple of sizes out of her reach.  If she is thin in your eyes and the only thing telling her otherwise is a piece of clothing, she'll work morning, noon, and night to fit into that cursed thing. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, go to Baby Gap.  You bring her a blouse and go, here, use this as a hat.  Emily from Cape Cod.  No, wait a minute.  It just updated.  I hate the way this updates.  I know.  Sorry.

[00:57:30]  Hey, this is what you do.  You tell them, leave the cannolis, take the gun.  There's something there.  Yeah, yeah.  You're so close to a funny line.  You flew right over it.  You swerved.  Something there.  No, I suck.  Let's go to Ken in Connecticut.  Ken?  We certainly do.  Ken?  Yeah, Ken.  You a great big fat person.  Yeah, I accidentally call her Frederica Bimmel in bed.  Right on.  Brian from St. Louis.  Fuck her skinny daughter from a previous marriage.

[01:03:30]  Goddamn rich cunt.  Doo-doo-doo-doo.  Doo-doo-doo-doo.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Let's get out.  Because he's hitting over the ratings book.  Let's go to Jason, Virginia Beach.  Jason.  Hey, morning, boys.  How you guys doing?  Hey.  Hey, Ope, I want to thank you for being there, man.  Because with these two there, Opie and Jim, this show would be a fucking disaster.  Or Anthony and Jim.  Honestly, I'm losing it, too, today. 
[01:04:00]  So, this show is just about a complete disaster.  I couldn't stop.  Disaster.  Hey.  I mean that in a good way.  Fuck the people.  I'm laughing my ass off.  I mean that in a good way.  Holy shit.  I couldn't stop laughing so hard.  Oh.  So, let's get the second clip.  Married radio team on the Today Show.  Their relationships take work.  What?  Their relationships take work, too?  What does that mean?  The work relationships take work, just like the regular. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, all right.  Their relationships take work, also.  I get it.  It's closeness without intimacy.  Kathy has a husband and two children at home in the suburbs.  There's no animosity, jealousy, anything there whatsoever.  Did you make it?  Eric lives in the city with his wife and four kids.  There's a little bit of me right when I hear that, that Kathy feels it's an affair without the sex.  It makes me a little bit jealous.  Aw. 
[01:05:00]  When the work spouses make an appearance, the real ones do, too.  Wife number one, wife number two.  I really have it.  Good, don't I?  The best of all worlds.  Corporate couples bound by work.  I definitely spend more time with Eric, my work spouse.  This is all of the positive benefits without having to deal with any real life issues.  But just like real marriages, the ones at work take work.  Have a conversation with your partner at work to say, how is this going to be perceived by our spouses and by each other at work? 
[01:05:30]  Why would you think about how is this going to be perceived by our spouses on the radio?  To make it as dull as is humanly possible.  I don't know if my husband would go for that.  Well, I don't know.  What do you think, Kathy?  The whole bit where you want to see how many different boots you can fit in my cunt by kicking.  I don't know if my husband's going to like that.  Now, Kathy.  For the show, come on.  We got the ratings coming out.  We got to do something to boost them. 
[01:06:00]  Sweep, squeak.  I don't know if my husband's going to like the whole deal about those bears fucking me in the backside with my face mushed into the console.  You want to win, Kathy?  They discuss it with their significant others.  That's wonderful.  Dullards.  That must just make for some great radio.  They play another game called Want to Ruin a Marriage. 
[01:06:30]  Do they?  Uh-oh.  What is that?  Way number one, leave your sunglasses at the restaurant.  Number two, take the van and your kids down to the boat dock.  Hit reverse.  Marriage over.  Every married couple has at least a few of these.  The eight secret bad habits that can ruin a marriage.  Which show member does the most of these?  Oh, that's good.  Bad habit number one, watching TV during dinner. 
[01:07:00]  Ah.  During dinner?  Yeah, yeah.  Bad habit number two.  Hey, I'm guilty.  I'm guilty of that one.  He doesn't watch dinner.  It's whenever we're having tomato stew.  He puts out the Zarkali beheadings.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I'm guilty.  Guilty of the same.  Bad habit number two.  Yeah.  Going too long without sex. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bad habit number three.  Going a whole work day without talking to your sweetheart.  Oh, ew.  Whole work day?  Sweetheart?  So, you got to call in.  Bad habit number four.  Wait, Eric's got four kids with that woman.  You don't need to talk to her.  Just fucking yell and the echo will bounce off the inside of her twat.  Bad habit number four.  Tuning each other out.  You don't want to do that, fellas.  He's on a radio.  You just got to turn the dial.  Number five. 
[01:08:00]  Not fighting.  Number six.  Going out more.  Not fighting?  Yeah.  Going out more with friends than with your spouse.  Number seven.  Being too close.  And number eight.  Sharing too much with your parents or in-laws.  Yeah.  Time for another Daily Dose.  All right.  I love these.  They're coming in like crazy now, guys.  There is nothing better than awful whole radio.  Eric and Kathy's Daily Dose number two.  Girls' father got into silly accidents. 
[01:08:30]  Silly.  Let's think.  What could a silly...  A girl's father.  A girl's father into a silly accident.  I bet he was jerking off looking at his daughter, and he fell forward, and his cock hit the crib.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  Now, that's silly.  That'll make you feel like a goose.  What silly accidents could you have?  Silly.  Hey, here's our candy. 
[01:09:00]  Oh.  Okay.  In case you missed it, here's what happened on the Eric and Kathy show.  On The Mix.  Crystal Baddad.  My father got in an accident last Monday, and he's fine.  He's in the hospital or whatnot, and we've been yelling at him constantly ever since.  How nice of you.  Yeah, I know.  Because it was such a silly accident.  We go to see him, or call, and he's asked for no visitors, and he's unplugged his phone in his room.  No way!  Unplug the phone, no visitors, and I want a heavy morphine drip for the next 12 hours.  Oh! 
[01:09:30]  With Eric and Kathy.  That's it?  On The Mix.  What was the silly accident?  You know what a silly accident is?  You have two bus full of retards, and you're in between them, and a truck hits one and crushes your head.  It's silly.  I don't know what happened.  Did it involve a habit trail?  A small animal, perhaps?  In hindsight, lighting the match was a bad idea.  Mark in Virginia.  Yeah, I was just going to say, you guys suck now.  Since you sold out the FM. 
[01:10:00]  You hung up.  John from Virginia.  Let it be known that he hung up.  John in Virginia.  Hey, guys.  I just want to tell you guys, you guys are over the top today.  I had to pull over.  I was laughing so damn hard.  There's two calls back-to-back.  This is what we have to deal with on a daily basis.  Y'all take care.  Have a good one, guys.  Thank you.  We didn't set that up or nothing.  One after another.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Mike in Pennsylvania.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, if these two aren't married to each other, what makes them any different than any local 
[01:10:30]  jack-off and annoying cunt show out there?  Nothing.  And he's saying you get all the benefits.  It's like, what are you talking about?  You don't get to fuck the person, and you have to listen to him talk.  That's just the opposite.  You know what I think the first guy's problem was with the show?  Perhaps he was listening to it while he was scraping off colorful blue pony borders from a room in his house.  What are you doing?  I try to look at it positive. 
[01:11:00]  I'm just kind of painting the new study.  Always wanted my own office.  That could have been an issue with him, is why he recalled.  I bet she's going to work with his wife, and she's like, you called that.  It was definitely something personal.  You find this funny?  He took it very personal.  We're finding some more.  Do the top ten signs your...  What about this?  Wait. 
[01:11:30]  Wait, wait.  Top ten signs your woman is ruining your life.  No, no.  Running.  Running your life?  Running what?  Top ten signs your woman is running your life.  Yeah.  How about ten annoying things women do?  From Eric and Kathy.  Ten annoying things women do.  Yes.  One through eight.  Breathe. 
[01:12:00]  Men confess ten annoying things women do.  Number ten.  Pretending to be virtuous.  That's...  Yeah.  Okay.  They're losing me here.  Number nine.  Criticizing other women.  Catty.  That's called being catty.  Number eight.  Number eight.  Acting jealous.  Men confess ten annoying things women do.  How about becoming needy?  Ooh.  Or speaking in code.  Or invading our personal space. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, like man town.  That's right.  That would be coming into man town.  This has man town all over it.  Yeah.  Becoming too emotional.  Shopping till they drop.  Talking incessantly.  Incessantly.  Incessantly.  And number one.  Using sex as a weapon.  Yeah.  Talking incessantly.  Papa.  Sex. 
[01:13:00]  Let's go to Chris in Houston.  Grandmama.  Hands up.  Hey, buddy.  Laser guided clitoris.  Chris.  Hey, you guys are two hoots and a holler today.  I was so hot.  I have cum in my pants.  Waka waka.  Waka waka indeed.  John in New Hampshire.  John.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Dude, Jimmy, that line about hitting the crib, that was fucking hilarious.  I just think it's a little silly accident that dad can have. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  Thank you, John.  All right, dude.  All right.  Take it easy.  Here's the final clip of these guys on TV with Matt Lauer on the Today Show.  Yeah.  Eric and Kathy.  Eric and Kathy.  They have like a married marriage relationship, but they're not married and they're not having  sex.  Number one.  Have the name Kathy.  Thank you, Jason.  For raises or demotions in sick days and vacation days, forsaking all others as long as they  both work at the mix.  Which is exactly what I've been trying to say. 
[01:14:00]  Yes.  Well, Eric and Kathy are the definition of a work husband and work wife, and they're here  with us now.  But it definitely begs the question, guys.  First of all, good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Has it always been platonic?  Eric, has it always been platonic, Eric?  There was that one night in Rio, but it never really panned out.  She blew me.  But we don't talk about it.  We were in Rio, and she wanted to do a broadcast, but I was fucking one of the locals for $100 American 
[01:14:30]  dollars.  Blame it on Rio.  That didn't work out.  We went to Rio, went to the poorest place in the world.  Well, holy crap.  I was fucking her in Vegas one day.  It was great.  And I have herpes.  So, you know, what went in Kathy, stays in Kathy.  Or something like that.  I don't know what the fucking slogan is.  What happens in Kathy, stays in Kathy. 
[01:15:00]  Oops.  Well, how about what happens in Vegas, stays in Kathy.  Stays in Kathy.  There you go.  Thank you.  Pulled me out of a ditch.  Well, the joke was awful, because he goes, he has always been platonic.  Well, there was that one night in Rio, but that didn't panned out.  So, the answer would be yes, shit dick.  Let's go to Chris in Philly.  Chris, what's up?  Guys, you missed a great one of Anthony's lines when he was talking about women using sex as  a weapon.  He said the laser guy, the clitoris.  Oh, I didn't even get that.  Well, after the sex as a weapon, I knew someone like Chris was out there. 
[01:15:30]  All right.  Ball sack in Brooklyn.  Ball sack.  Yeah, I was laughing so hard I had to pull over and jerk off.  Atta boy.  All right.  Back to Eric and Kathy.  Always been platonic.  Has it always been platonic, Eric?  There was that one night in Rio, but it never really panned out.  I had a dream once.  It was quite disturbing, actually.  Disturbing?  Really?  Really?  That makes me feel pretty good.  You're like my brother. 
[01:16:00]  Right.  Right.  Yeah, it's been platonic since day one.  Hey, Eric and Kathy.  They're trying to do shit.  Yeah, it's been platonic since day one.  But let me tell you about day two.  Hot dinner in the ass.  And a lot of these guys have to do the radio voice thing.  He's still doing the radio voice thing on TV.  What was the dream she had?  That they were syndicated to more than one dumb market?  Nothing?  That a radio joke would get left with guys?  No.  Oh, Jesus.  Sewer Trout wants to add another most annoying thing women do. 
[01:16:30]  Float back to shore with the fetus.  Sorry to break into the fun, guys, but we have another piece of audio from the Eric and Kathy show.  I can't get enough of the Eric and Kathy show. 
[01:17:00]  From their podcast, they do a podcast, listeners have invention ideas, and this includes dick joke.  What?  This includes a dick joke.  No way.  We have young Albert Einstein's on hold here.  You're the American inventor.  The ropeless jump rope.  It's just days away from invading a gym near you.  How ridiculous are you going to look?  Don't do it, folks.  Don't fall for it.  Do that in the privacy of your own home.  The barless prison cell.  I'm telling you, that's an idea.  Go for it.  Of course somebody else does.  The barless prison cell. 
[01:17:30]  There we go.  Hi, Mike.  You've actually begun the process to invent something.  Yes, sir, I have.  All right.  What is it?  It's a pool skimmer.  Pool skimmer.  Okay.  Now, you know they've got those already, right?  I think there's a couple out there.  But yours is different how?  It's a lot bigger.  There was a big storm.  Big, huge, massive net.  Don't tell them, my wife.  Everybody's got to whip out something bigger, don't they, Mike?  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Let's just go home.  I want to know about the pool skimmer.  So do I.  The new one.  It has a picture of William Shatner on the handle.  Wow.  I just want the bigger one.  It's the old Tommy Lee net.  It's a net with a hole in the bottom.  Let's go to Jake in Chicago, Jake.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You guys are on fucking fire today, man.  And I've got XM, and I can't wait for you to come to Chicago and fucking destroy Man Cow and every other lame-ass show like this. 
[01:18:30]  I'm praying they put us on in Chicago.  I'm praying.  Yes, pray.  Oh, it will get very interesting.  Thank you, Jake.  No problem, guys.  Hey, keep it up, guys.  All right.  They invented the unfunny radio show.  Let's go to Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  You guys friggin' kick a fucking ass, dude.  I was listening to you guys.  You're on NEW.  I started listening to Howard.  He friggin' sucks balls.  You guys are fucking awesome. 
[01:19:00]  Thank you, my friend.  Howard can't suck anymore because he doesn't even do radio.  He's not on the air anymore, apparently.  He doesn't do Fridays, and he's now going to...  He friggin' sucks ass.  You guys fucking kill.  Thank you, bro.  Every day.  Hey, another thing.  Norton, you killed on Lucky Louie, man.  Thank you, man.  Thanks, buddy.  What a creep, right?  Norton's blown up right in front of our eyes.  Sorry.  Oh, was that my compliment and I hung up on him?  Uh-huh.  Oops.  Was there a little compliment for me?  There was something for me.  Was there a little something for me?  Uh-huh.  Kid. 
[01:19:30]  Did we finish their interview?  Wait, where...  That cheesy interview.  I don't know if we finished it.  Wait, what were we doing?  The interview.  The Kathy and, uh...  That dummy interview.  Oh, Eric and Kathy?  On the Today Show.  Oh, we were still doing that?  Yeah.  Yeah, they were still talking.  Yeah, you did the Rio joke, which was kind of funny.  All right, I'll move back a little bit here.  One night in Rio, but it never really panned out.  I had a dream once.  It was quite disturbing, actually.  Disturbing.  He was relaxed.  Really, that makes me feel pretty good.  You're like my brother.  Right, right. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, it's been platonic since day one.  Yes.  Hey, Eric and Kathy, it's Matt in New York.  You know, obviously married couples, real married couples fight, so what do you guys fight about?  Usually whether or not we're platonic, Matt.  Right.  That's what it comes down to.  It's the only thing we fight about.  Yeah.  You know what?  We have the advantage here that there's not a lot of fighting.  A lot of the time we spend on the air is having a good time, and the majority of our  morning is spent on the air the whole time, and then once we leave here, we just go home  and fight with our regular spouses, usually.  Oh, and they love that. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, exactly.  All right, guys, thank you very much.  Yeah.  They're telling us you've got to go.  They're telling us you've got to go.  Yeah, we are.  It's usually about if we're going to be platonic or not.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  And they said no to the Opie and Anthony interview.  Two questions, and they were out.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:21:00]  Sirius XM.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock, and the show is off.  So we're playing stuff that you haven't heard before.  Maybe it's new to you, or maybe it's stuff that's just really old.  You're like, oh, my God, I forgot they even did that.  But Lord knows there's some stuff on this show that I totally forgot that we have done,  like this particular segment here.  Guess the sound.  Simple concept.  We find some audio online, and the guys have to guess what the hell is actually going on  in this audio clip.  I was surprised.  I know you will be.  And it becomes a really famous clip on the show. 
[01:21:30]  I don't know if we really use it.  No, we don't use it too much anymore.  But for a while, it was a very famous clip on the show.  Here it is.  Guess the sound.  I'm guessing 2006 or 2007, somewhere in there.  It's the worst of the O.P. Anthony show.  Here we go.  We'll play guess the sound.  Danny is the judge here.  He put this together.  Here's the first sound.  Dak from Enemy Mine.  Did sound like Dak.  That's some sucking going on.  Wow, yeah.  That's a guy holding a girl fucking her. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  I think it's blowjob.  Fisting.  I say blowjob.  He's fucking her mouth.  Uh, hugging?  Canoodling.  Oh, play it again.  I hope I have it.  Okay, Jimmy.  Hold on a minute here.  That's an in-love couple eating ice cream.  Vanilla.  Yes.  With jimmies.  It might be a blowjob.  I think it's a blowjob. 
[01:22:30]  I take that.  Okay, guys ready?  Yeah.  It is indeed throat fucking.  Nice.  Throat fucking.  Nice.  I thought I heard that, uh, that sound of...  A bitch trying to talk?  Yeah, that's, that's that.  He's clogging her throat and unclogging it with the acoustics of a mouth used as an old  Victrola speaker.  That's how it kind of...  All right, ready for the snapping noise.  I'll look for the next one.  Wait, what is that from?  Victrola speaker.  Just some odd video I found.  A Disney movie, you fucking asshole.  What do you think it's from? 
[01:23:00]  A porno?  No, no, no.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, I should rephrase that.  Get me a coffee.  Will do.  Get to the point.  All right.  I'm trying to be coy.  What is that?  Is that, uh, here we go.  Very coy.  The next sound, everybody.  Guess the sound.  Spanking at Christmas.  Wow, yeah, there's something...  Christmassy about it.  ...music going on?  Some slapping, or...  Getting spanked over Glockenspiel. 
[01:23:30]  I think that, I think you're right.  They're watching Close Encounters in the background.  Yeah, Close Encounters is playing in the background, and Steve stepped in a bear trap.  Um, it's a happy couple on Christmas Eve clapping.  Because they got exactly what they wanted.  Yes.  Each other.  Aw.  A miscarriage.  Can I ask a question? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Is that allowed?  Yeah.  Is the music part of the action, or just background music?  No, it's just what happens to be on the background.  Oh, okay, thank you.  That's important.  Regardless.  I thought maybe, uh, Yosemite Sam was rigging up the xylophone to blow up the rabbit, make  it look like an accident.  Vito.  But no, it's not.  That one, you dumb vermin.  I bet it's nothing sexual.  Vito.  Hey, what's up, boys?  That sounded like maybe it was that Scott Perel fucker's heart box exploded or something.  That's Vito?  I know. 
[01:24:30]  Vito.  Vito Corleone.  That's the southern mob.  I'm going to make him an offer that I can't spell.  Look how they done massacred my boy.  I don't know.  You ain't going to be able to stop no lucha brazzy if he should hang himself in his trailer. 
[01:25:00]  Stop now.  You're a-spilling it.  Monday, Sunday, Tuesday, Friday, Wednesday.  I didn't want this for you.  Farmer Corleone.  Pig Razor Corleone.  Not this, though.  Salzo's a pimp. 
[01:25:30]  What's y'all going to do?  Put your musket right up to his head and go bite a bang?  Get it all over your goddamn overalls?  Fancy grammar school boy.  That was brutal.  Tom Mix does not get that picture.  Oh, man.  That was the worst Vito. 
[01:26:00]  Goddammit.  He was banging hee-haw girls two at a time.  Please get better.  Your cousin, son, and grandson, Frank.  Fucking perfect.  Oh, man.  God damn.  Vito.  Vito from down south.  Chris in Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  That first sound, is that the sound of Pharrell trying to save his job with Howie? 
[01:26:30]  Oh.  All right.  I won't give him a-  No, that was a good one, sir.  You were saved.  He had no confidence in it.  As he shouldn't have.  With Howie?  Troy.  Cringe from Oregon.  That's right.  All right.  All right.  I'm thinking that it's a guy getting his cock stopped on by some dominators chick.  What?  The one we just played?  A little-  Yeah, the one we just played.  Wait, let me hear that again.  Nah, I-  That would be hard if it's not- 
[01:27:00]  I think it's a spanking of some sort, but that seems too obvious.  Yeah.  This Danny's a trickster.  It's not a spanking.  Yes, I know.  I'll bet it's non-sexual at all.  Right?  No, he's not going to.  Stapler to the penis.  No.  By the way, do we still want an adult baby in the studio?  I may have a line on an adult baby.  Whoever has the one.  Wait a minute.  We talk-  Still?  Why did we talk about this?  That came so fucking out of the fucking blue.  No, do you remember we talked about it?  No, we didn't.  No, we never talked.  Should I leave the room? 
[01:27:30]  No.  Don't drag us into your sick mind.  Holy shit.  You have-  We need to remember we were talking-  No, you guys had an adult baby at any W.  Yeah, we did once.  And we talked about it.  I'd love to get that in.  Remember you were saying, like, hey, let's do it?  No.  No, we don't remember, Jimmy.  No.  But I want an adult baby.  Of course you do.  You're lining one up.  I just want to tease it and hurt it.  By the way-  Of course we do.  He was just waiting for us to say yes, and he was going to excuse himself to go change.  Yeah.  I want to sit in my dieters.  Got a little rattle. 
[01:28:00]  Just a little baba.  Just don't promise me you won't laugh.  Let's go to Greg in Connecticut.  That's the promise we had to make last time.  Did you laugh?  Some chick says, well, bring one in, but you've got to promise not to laugh because  this is a serious business.  First thing we did was crack up.  Oh, you have to.  Because the guy not only was dressed like an adult baby, he went to pacify at a big time.  Dude, he went old school adult baby.  Oh, the bonnet?  Like the big baby Huey bonnet, like baby Huey used to wear.  And the big cloth diapers.  The fucking guy goes old school on us and thinks we're not going to laugh. 
[01:28:30]  Big, flabby, hairy chest, and he's dressed like a fucking baby.  Where do you find a bonnet now?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Where do you get a bonnet?  Let's go to a grown man.  You go to a baby store and say, you got anything for a kid with Down syndrome?  Like a bonnet that I can put on my fuel, please?  Let's go to a gooch.  You've got to be specific.  If you ask the way you did, they'll just hand you a gun.  Or it's the only bonnet slash steam ass. 
[01:29:00]  You won't be ruining this family picture.  Gooch.  Gooch in Cleveland.  Gooch.  One with louvered blinds that pull down in the front.  Sleep time, stupid.  Click.  Snap.  Oh, bro.  Hey, uh, Gooch.  Who's the curtains with the Pete Rose hairdo?  Oh, man. 
[01:29:30]  The curtains with the Pete Rose hairdo.  Gooch.  How you doing, boys?  What's up, buddy?  I don't want him coming out of that outhouse with just his dick in his hand.  Back to that.  All right.  There's an old-fashioned water fountain.  We can take the gun behind it.  Oh, man. 
[01:30:00]  Let's go to Greg in Connecticut.  Greg?  Yeah, hi.  I think that sound sounds like Jimmy being the ice cream man.  All right.  We have any more?  Sit and let it die.  We have any more guesses on this sound?  All right.  What is it, Danny?  You guys ready?  Uh, wait a minute.  Guy? 
[01:30:30]  Fucking a girl in the ass.  Her head's hitting the headboard.  Nope.  Damn it.  I had to guess something.  What is it?  That was good.  It's an Asian gentleman in a, uh, in like a sumo diaper getting kicked in the nuts.  As hard as he can by some trick.  Oh, wow.  What is she moaning for, then?  I don't know.  Her foot probably hurts.  That rotten little non-existent Asian dick.  She's kicking his crotch bone.  Oh, pelvis.  Whatever it's called.  His pelvis, yeah.  His crotch bone.  Thank you, Dr. Norton.  You know, the asshole bone. 
[01:31:00]  Let's listen again here.  Here it is.  Damn.  Oh, man.  Oh.  Gee, that's being kicked?  Yep.  Brutal.  Well, it's an old Southern tradition.  No father can refuse a request on the day of his 11-year-old daughter's birth wedding.  You almost fucked up.  You enjoyed it too much.  All right.  We're ready for the third sound.  We got this one and one more.  Let's do it.  Here it is. 
[01:31:30]  Wow.  That's all you give us, Danny?  Yeah, I mean, I gave you some easy ones.  The next one is probably the best.  What the hell?  I just got to go with first instinct here.  Anal.  A guy's jamming it right up her ass.  Ass, yeah.  Wait.  One more time?  That's got to hurt.  Yeah, yeah.  And she didn't see him before you did it.  Yeah, she's on her bed reading on her stomach. 
[01:32:00]  Snuck up on her.  This is the T-Man at 1035.  Nice.  I like it.  Tasering his ball bag today.  And his asshole.  And his asshole, Opie.  And his asshole.  Sorry, I left out the sexy part.  It's just queer if it's only the ball bag.  The asshole kind of brings it all around.  Any other guesses on this sound?  That's an Asian girl, definitely.  Yeah, definitely Asian.  Definitely.  No. 
[01:32:30]  Black men too, Boku.  You watch those anime things?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Yeah.  No.  It's always some fucking giant, big Asian.  With like a glowing orange cock.  And then they go.  And this jizz, cartoon jizz comes out.  They are the most perverted fucking collection of people.  Yes.  I love it.  The Japanese.  They're all the schoolgirl uniforms. 
[01:33:00]  They pick up the back.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  And then their ass has like, their ass has like that, that tic-tac-toe shine on it.  That, that cartoons have.  Because it's not supposed to have anything on it at all.  A pure nice ass.  Oh, then they turn more dark, toy diver.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How many volumes of this crap do you have?  18.  18 anime porno fucking videotapes.  Let's go to the hillbilly.  You want to guess the sound, hillbilly? 
[01:33:30]  You don't want in on this one?  Why?  What's wrong?  Who, Wimper?  I have no idea.  No idea?  How about a guess, though?  Here it is again.  Let's do it again.  It's got to be a tool in up the ass, is what I'm saying.  Here's the sound again.  Ah!  What do you think?  Wow.  Well, we're waiting.  I have no idea.  Nothing.  That was a waste of time.  It should be anal.  It's got to be anal.  I know what it is, but I don't want to say it because I've seen the clip.  Say it.  No, you haven't. 
[01:34:00]  Danny?  I have.  Really?  Yeah.  Danny?  It's a chick getting her very first DP.  Double penetration!  Oh, there we go.  Ah!  Yeah, but which part of the DP was that?  Well, one on the front, one on the back.  That was the back.  Of course it was.  Yes.  New back.  That was the obvious.  Nice.  You should start in the asshole.  That's my rule of thumb.  Opie is fixated on fucking curling.  There was some strategy going on that you missed, Anthony.  I saw it because I'm watching it on the TV over here.  All right.  I'm telling you, you're going to be hooked on this dumb curling.  Stupid curling.  I'm already sick of curling. 
[01:34:30]  I was hooked on it for a few minutes, and now I hate it.  I just want to slide up the street like that.  Oh, how silly would you look?  It would be great.  Go to an ice skating rink and just do that.  Yeah, just curl.  Just fuck people up.  Go to 40 Rock.  We got some action now on the curling court.  Action.  Or ice or whatever.  All right.  The last sound of, guess the sound.  All right.  All right. 
[01:35:00]  All right.  Oh, my God.  I know it. 
[01:35:30]  What is this, Jimmy?  Steve C. pounding his chest, standing on the body of a prostitute.  That's brutal.  Holy shit.  What the hell was that?  I guess I have to ask a question.  Asian dude?  Is there sex in...  Is this off a porno?  No, I think it's a dude singing.  It's kind of hard to say without... 
[01:36:00]  Okay, all right.  You're the judge when it comes to what you can or can't say.  Russ Howard's nuts frozen to the floor while he's throwing his...  Wait, wait, wait.  Give him a mic down.  Hold on.  Russ Howard's nuts frozen to the ice while he's throwing...  That's pretty funny, actually.  That's pretty good.  Russ Howard's nuts frozen to the floor.  From the curling guy, Russ Howard.  Yeah, well, I'm glad you enjoy making fun of Russ Howard.  I don't go for that.  He's the bad boy of curling.  Thank you.  And we've got to now play Russ Howard curling audio.  This is real audio.  There you go. 
[01:36:30]  I think Frank's right.  It could be Russ Howard.  Here's guest to sound number four, just a piece.  It's obviously some kind of jungle thing going on, I'm thinking, because I hear some kind 
[01:37:00]  of drums.  Any guesses?  I'm going to say Asian.  I'm going to stay with the Asian theme.  Yeah, Asians are the sickest.  Some dude, balls getting twisted.  Oh, wow.  A ball twist.  That's good.  I know what it is.  That's good.  Nice.  It's a man trying to pull hot toast out of the toaster.  And it's burning his hands.  It's burning his fingers.  Mike.  Mike the trucker.  Fingers.  Yeah, the sound is deleted scenes from Brokeback Mountain. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, it's going to be on the DVD version.  It's not deleted.  Ready for the answer?  No, I'm still trying to guess.  The ball mutilation thing is very good.  Thank you.  The twisting of the balls.  I'm going to say a woman in high heels stepping on a guy's ball sack.  There you go.  Really?  Some type of ball mutilation.  Hello.  I say.  But you get partial credit for the assist because I wasn't thinking that way.  I'm thinking a nail and a hammer.  Oof. 
[01:38:00]  Nope.  Oh.  Nothing.  Although it does have something to do with balls.  Yeah.  Intriguing.  You and Derek in the office last week.  Dang.  That has something to do with balls also.  Ball mutilation.  There might have been some.  It's a guy with icy hot on his balls.  No.  But I thought it was.  What happened?  Twist.  Step.  He's giving like hand signals like the military now.  What happened?  Yeah.  What do you say noise?  I think.  Than just told him five troops and a tank are coming this way. 
[01:38:30]  The panzer.  Yeah.  We're just going to get the answer ready so you can see the answer.  Oh.  Oh.  Nice.  We get a video.  It's like a video daily double on Jeopardy.  Click off of WWE.com, Eric.  And get to.  If you don't know Eric, Eric enjoys wrestling.  The wrestling site.  For the bodies.  He just trolls him all day long when he's supposed to be working, by the way.  Was he that guy crying talking to the wrestlers on the tape?  Exactly.  Might as well then.  Here's the audio once again. 
[01:39:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Rhythm.  Yeah.  Is it a guy? 
[01:39:30]  Are there two girls involved?  No, it's a lone gunman.  He's a lone gunman?  He's by himself?  Yes, indeed.  I can never get those noises out of myself by myself.  No, why would you?  After the first...  These guys are very confident in this video.  They think we're going to love it.  I'm hearing some kind of rhythmic thing.  Indeed you are.  So he's doing something.  Sewing machine.  Working on a railroad?  Yeah.  Sewing machine? 
[01:40:00]  All right.  We have the video already.  Let's just see it.  He's fucking something.  This is the answer right here.  Uh-oh.  Why are you...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  What am I seeing?  I don't even know what I'm looking at here.  What am I seeing here?  What the fuck?  I think the guy...  Is this video up on opianthony.com?  I think what I'm seeing is...  Is that a butt plug?  Yes, indeed it is.  The guy's got a butt plug buried up his ass.  It's a rear view.  He's kind of bent over a desk. 
[01:40:30]  Right.  He's got a butt plug shoved up his ass.  Is that something on his dick?  No.  It looks like his balls.  How big is his balls?  Because he's swinging what looks like his ball sack, which is huge, and it's swinging back  and forth really hard, flipping up and hitting the butt plug.  So with each swing, his nuts smack the butt plug and hit it further into his asshole.  It looks like a broken clock.  Anthony, my friend, you are a poet.  Anybody know that?  I try to weave the words. 
[01:41:00]  That's what?  Wait, what?  That can't be his ball bag.  Danny, what is the official answer?  Unless it's Derek.  It's a guy, I mean, just hammering a butt plug into his ass with his balls.  With his balls by swinging them back and forth.  No hands, people.  No, that's the beauty of this trick.  No, he's like in the frisk position.  Houdini.  Look, Ma, no dignity.  That cannot be his ball bag.  Dude, it's swinging up to his lower back.  Like a pendulum.  His ball bag is hitting where his crack ends at his lower back. 
[01:41:30]  This could be the greatest freak video ever.  Looks like a hoppity hop.  He has a hernia.  This man needs help.  Jesus.  Wow.  And this is the audio again.  It shouldn't be able to do that, right?  The sound makes sense.  What?  I will never be the same person I was when I walked in here. 
[01:42:00]  No, none of us will.  Sherrod is like silly white boys.  How does he just stop?  Whose scrotum can do that?  His?  Holy.  That's like how he says wahoo.  Wahoo.  It's like he realizes what he's doing and he's got to go, holy shit. 
[01:42:30]  Wahoo.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst, worst, worst, worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  My name is Erock.  I'm filling in for Opie and Anthony.  They're not here.  We're playing some best of that we call worst of and hopefully you are enjoying it.  If not, well, I'll try better next time. 
[01:43:00]  But for right now, another one of those pot talk type of subjects where we reminisce about  high school and teachers and what we were doing way, way back in the long, long ago.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  You know what the problem is?  We see the staff as one entity.  Right.  So when Erock takes off one week and then someone else takes off, we're like, wow, someone  on the staff is off.  Right.  So it seems like they're always off.  And then we're sitting here like, I'm here every time someone's taking off.  It's just a dumb joke. 
[01:43:30]  I know it's not true.  Oh, I know.  But it's similar to what happened when I used to cut class in school.  I would cut class.  Yeah.  And I would be like, how come I'm not graduating, but everyone I cut class with is?  And then I realized, because I was cutting every class and I would be with somebody that  used to cut first period and then someone else that cut second period.  Were you the only guy that didn't suck the gym teacher's dick?  Because how do you, how do you not graduate just because you didn't fucking do gym?  I have no idea.  Is that story true? 
[01:44:00]  Uh, yes.  That's how you've told it over the years that you didn't graduate high school because  you fucked up with gym?  I fucked up with gym class.  And there's no one in the high school that gives you the passeroo because it's stupid  gym?  No, because I had potential and they saw that and didn't want to squeak me through.  I had to go to summer school for gym.  Summer school for gym?  There was something else, luckily, so it wasn't just gym because if I had to get up early in  the summer just to go to gym, that would have sucked.  But I had to wake up early during the summer and I would just go play handball with a friend  of mine.  It sucked.  I was very active and into sports growing up. 
[01:44:30]  Gym was just a waste of time.  Yeah.  You didn't do shit in gym.  It really was just a babysitting class.  Like, after school was when I did probably three to four hours of gym every day.  Yeah.  Every day.  And way cooler stuff.  Yeah.  Much better sports.  Like, real sports.  Not stupid dodgeball, which was kind of cool, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Or pushing that huge medicine ball around or playing with the dumb parachute.  The parachute.  Who gives a fuck?  We're learning that square dancing shit. 
[01:45:00]  Square dancing.  We played fucking, you know, baseball.  Yes.  And smear the queer.  Whoa.  That's what we called our neighbor.  We didn't even know what gay was.  That was kill the guy with the ball?  Yeah, but we called it smear the queer.  Wow.  That's so politically incorrect.  I know.  But we didn't know any better.  Damn.  We were just kids.  We didn't know what gay was or queer was.  We just knew if you had the ball, we had to smear you.  Yeah, and you were a queer, whatever that is.  That's right. 
[01:45:30]  That's right.  Who knew?  Because if you asked me, I don't know where we got the fucking word from.  Yeah.  It's just there.  I have no idea.  Right.  Because we didn't talk like that in my household.  It's passed down through generations of kids.  Nice.  Gym class was useless.  I would go, but then I would kind of leave.  I was the guy that never, you're like,  Come here, why aren't you dressed for gym class?  Where's your uniform?  It's like fucking shorts and your dumb fucking t-shirt. 
[01:46:00]  I don't have it.  Or it's squished in my locker.  It's smelling so fucking foul that I don't even want to go near it  because I never took it home to be washed.  Remember how crusty it would get?  Terrible.  And that's not because there was cum all over.  Yes.  It's just because it would be wet and sweaty  and you just would leave it in the bottom of your locker.  Just leave it there.  It stunk.  And the only thing that actually was supposed to be done  was that stupid presidential physical fitness test.  Yeah, that was dumb.  And no one did anything to make it.  Like, they'd give it to you at some point in the year 
[01:46:30]  and you were supposed to get better because of gym class.  But you never did anything in gym class  that would have made you do more pull-ups.  You mean you didn't do proper training?  Exactly.  There's no fucking PT going on in fucking gym class.  You mean climbing the rope every once in a while  didn't make you a better athlete  so you would have better numbers?  You can't do one pull-up private pile!  In my high school, we had weightlifting.  Weightlifting?  Like you go to prison?  Pretty much.  Yeah, I was Flushing High School.  Oh, okay.  But yeah, that was the only time I ever enjoyed gym 
[01:47:00]  because for 40 minutes a day,  I could just go and work out with gym class.  Pump some iron.  Yeah, it wasn't bad.  We didn't do any of that shit.  Nothing.  I learned my wee-wee could feel really good.  Cool.  What?  Oh, yeah.  In the locker room.  No.  The gym teacher?  Huh?  Is this back to blowing the gym teacher?  No, man.  Just keep climbing the ropes.  Did you guys get to climb the ropes?  I never climbed a single rope.  I was so bad at gym.  I always used to like...  Climbing the ropes, you learn,  holy fuck, that wee-wee could feel really good.  Really?  Yeah.  That's what set me down that road.  I was pretty good at climbing that goddamn rope. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, I thought you meant that.  I was pretty good at knowing that my wee-wee felt good.  Fucking that rope.  That's what I was good at.  Just keep on fucking that rope.  I just swung there at the bottom of the rope.  Not moving anywhere.  You never went up?  I couldn't get up.  It's your heritage.  You never went up to the fucking high beams?  No, I couldn't get up there.  No, remember how creepy it was?  Oh, man, when you went up there and you fucking go boom!  And you're looking down?  You hit that high beam?  Boom!  You're looking down, it's only probably what?  I don't know.  Well, no, it's in general.  It was pretty high.  Gymnasium ceiling.  It was pretty fucking high.  Pretty fucking high as a kid.  You're like, holy fuck, if I let go, I'm dead. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, no, you're not.  They got that wafer-thin mat under there that obviously would do nothing but absorb up the  blood.  Fucking mat stunk.  I remember, I don't even know why, but I had one of those angry fucking gym teachers  in grammar school.  And we weren't doing something right.  He had his stupid stopwatch out.  And I wish I remember exactly what we weren't doing right, but just imagine, it was something  dumb.  We were only like 11, 12 tops.  And I remember him throwing it across the gym and it's shattering.  He was just so annoyed at us. 
[01:48:30]  I don't even know.  See, they're all frustrated jocks, first of all.  They wanted to be some fucking big thing.  Do you know how bad they have to feel every morning putting that whistle around their neck?  Do you know when they fucking take that whistle out and put it around their neck, they're  just going, ugh, and thinking of being that fucking football player, baseball player,  something where something didn't pan out and they ended up there putting a whistle around  their neck.  Well, why the fuck would he shatter his stopwatch?  He's just thinking.  To me, I don't have a memory, because to me, it was a who gives a fuck day.  Because he's looking at some kid, some snot-nosed kid that doesn't know how to do shit instead 
[01:49:00]  of coaching some fucking baseball player.  And you're kind of right, because we had one of those guys, but he actually was pretty  cool, the story goes, he either was on the Nets, or they were almost on the Nets, because  he would tell the story every year.  Mine was Denver Broncos guy.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  My guy was something to do with the New York Nets at the time, because they were playing  on Long Island.  Yeah. 
[01:49:30]  And he blew out his knee.  My guy blew out his knee, too.  They all blew their knees out.  And that's why he's now a gym teacher.  Same thing with Gil Lilienthal.  So maybe that's what they teach you in gym teacher college.  Yeah.  Just tell your kids that you were a star athlete, but blew out your knee.  And that's why you're here.  They'll give you a little more respect.  Instead of, you know what, I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life, so at  the last minute I decided I was going to...  I went to college.  I took some college courses on child psychology and physical fitness. 
[01:50:00]  Right.  They just need some washed-up jock that blew his knee out.  Yeah, they know that no one's going to respect you if you tell the truth.  Like, well, actually, the drinking started when I was 12 years old.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a raging alcoholic, and this is pretty much the only thing I could do with my life.  Toes on the line.  Now I'm going to tell you about my Tommy John surgery.  What?  Exactly.  Really?  Your guy was a Broncos guy?  Oh, he was a Denver Broncos.  My guy was at New Jersey, I want to say, New York Nets.  Big fucking lineman, and he blew his knee out and ended up as a gym teacher. 
[01:50:30]  I would love to, like, get the stats right now, how many people listening to us are going,  holy shit, my guy was a Minnesota 20, blew out his knee in spring training.  It's like talking to how many hippies were at Woodstock.  It's way too many.  No, but I bet you a lot of people that was the story I got.  Yeah, that's the story.  We had a social studies teacher who was also the baseball coach, that all the rumors were  that he was, in his college days, very close to being a professional baseball player. 
[01:51:00]  Almost signed.  Blew his knee out.  He must have blown his knee out, because he didn't make it.  He blew his wrist out writing some social studies.  I know, there's a story of a guy, he made it, he started his career with two bad knees,  as a matter of fact.  Oh, man.  18 years ago.  Hey, well.  With two very bad knees.  This is the story, it tells the first day of school.  Yeah.  In gym class.  In a dream to become a major league baseball player.  Jeez, coach is crying.  But it didn't come true.  What happened, coach? 
[01:51:30]  What happened?  I beg God, the dream came true.  Nice.  Coach is crying.  Fucking hilarious.  What a faggot.  So, that fucking gym teacher had it out for you.  Yeah, yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  If you did everything, did you do everything else or you're leaving something out?  I may have been a little remiss in my social studies work.  I remember cutting a lot of that.  And it's odd, because I do enjoy a good social study.  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  But, I enjoyed smoking the marijuana cigarettes with my friends a little more.  And then I was from the school of thought that if I missed a certain amount of classes,  I could never venture to that side of the building anymore.  Because if the teach saw me, it would be embarrassing.  And the more days that went by, the more behind in the work I was,  and the more useless it would have been to go back into class.  So, it would be months at a clip.  I'd get caught, get sent down to the office, have the chat, 
[01:52:30]  and then now I'm back in the class, new slate, clean slate, new start,  and I'd fuck it up again.  But you wanted knowledge.  I love knowledge.  You were one of those guys that wanted knowledge.  So, why wouldn't you just make sure you graduated high school?  I should have.  I know.  Hindsight.  I'll be hindsight.  I should have.  You know, going back to the gym teacher thing real fast,  I just had a quick thought.  Fast forward about, I don't know,  honestly, probably only five years.  And there's going to be a bunch of snot-nosed kids in a gym somewhere,  and the gym teacher's going to come in and go, 
[01:53:00]  Hi, I'm Tim Tebow.  You might remember me.  No.  For my stellar college football career,  and, well, I was a bust in the NFL, but I'm here now.  I'm here now.  My gym teachers hated me.  Of course, you stink.  I used to make jokes and put no effort into anything.  Oh, like your show.  Well, at least I make jokes.  Yeah, that's true.  That's all it counts.  Well, you don't have a hint of a muscle on you,  so I would imagine that gym teachers would hate you. 
[01:53:30]  I was the guy hanging from the pull-up bar,  going,  One, Sam!  You could do one, Sam!  Oh, no.  Do one!  I'm like, can't do it.  Did you pop a quarter off your ankle for him  and show you that you've got ankle muscles?  You can't do one pull-up.  I'll bet I could now.  I bet you can't.  I bet I could.  Let's get a pull-up bar in here.  We need a pull-up bar.  Well, can't we do the fucking door jam pull-up bar thing?  We'd probably good if we had a pull-up bar, yeah.  Put some money on it.  Where's Mars?  You know Mars has all his workout.  Of course he should.  He has a Nautilus machine.  He doesn't have a radio show to worry about. 
[01:54:00]  Well, he quickly puts things away just before I get here.  Yeah.  I get here around 5.30.  There's weird videos being played  and all sorts of shit out in our studio.  His perfect push-up handles on the floor.  You know he has all his workout shit here.  Push-up handles.  Does he have those?  I got those.  I got those.  Yeah, because then you can go down a little further.  Are those the ones that twist?  I got the twisties, too.  Nice.  I got the two.  I got the ones that don't move,  and then I got the twisties.  Nice.  Yes.  I don't use them right now.  Are we putting some money on the pull-up?  Yeah, I'll fucking put $100.  For one? 
[01:54:30]  You can't do one pull-up.  All right, $100 for one.  Where's the pull-up bar?  You have to go all the way up.  See, he does have them.  Holy shit, there's his perfect push-up little things.  He really has them?  Mars has them.  Mars, I knew you.  I was making that up.  No, Mars has all sorts of workout equipment around here.  Mars, you got a pull-up bar?  No, unfortunately not.  That's what I was working on that one.  I pull up to the bar.  See, because I drink.  Wow, look at all the dust on your...  Yeah, why is that so dusty?  Look at all the dust on your push-up things. 
[01:55:00]  Not true.  Mars, you do push-ups here?  Yes.  Obviously not.  How many?  What?  Oh, damn.  Well, that was my joke with the dust on the things.  Is that a UFC shirt?  No.  Is it a jiu-jitsu shirt?  Yes.  All right.  I see that jiu-jitsu.  Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  Yes, sir.  One of the mixed martial arts.  Yeah.  So, yes, I try to knock out 300 a day.  Really?  What?  300 a day.  Sets of 30s.  10 sets of 30s.  Isn't that hard?  10 sets of 30.  Yeah.  You can do that.  Not with the twist at the end. 
[01:55:30]  No?  With the twist.  That's pretty impressive is what I'm saying.  But it's not...  A twist is a motherfucker.  It takes me about 20 minutes.  To do 30?  Yeah, resting.  To 30 push-ups?  You go down like this.  No, that's 30 push-ups.  You missed that.  30 push-ups?  30 push-ups.  You do 300 push-ups?  One, I got to rest almost a minute.  You do 320 minutes?  Two, I got to rest another almost a minute.  No, no, no.  What?  Yes.  Yes.  300 in about 20 minutes, yeah. 
[01:56:00]  The fuck?  I don't do 300 in a year.  I'm calling the SPN, by the way, because someone makes a great point.  Rat Spit in Vegas, one of the regulars.  You are officially the worst black athlete ever.  Sam Roberts?  Wow, Sam.  I'm waiting for that pull-up bar.  I'm getting 100.  You're that exception to the rule.  Mm-hmm.  I'm getting the 100.  Mars, you think he can do a proper pull-up?  No.  Not one, right?  Not one.  Not one.  Not one.  You got to go all the way up and get that chin to the bar.  All right, I'll do it.  Yes, got to go over.  You know who's a pull-up maniac?  Who?  That's the Troy. 
[01:56:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Troy's a pull-up.  Try to knock out 20.  One arm like this?  20's a lot, man.  I can't.  I don't even know how many can do this.  20's rough.  I can maybe do half that.  Which way?  Well, so he says.  Which way?  Ah, this is all hearsay.  This way or this way?  The harder ones are when your palms face away from you.  Palms away is a lot harder than palms away.  Why would you do it that way?  That's the way the Marines want it.  Yeah, but why?  A Marine!  It's spring wingspan.  Your lats.  And the other way doesn't work the last side. 
[01:57:00]  It's still on your bicep.  It's also the top of your forearm instead of the underside.  So, you know, this is a lot harder.  Believe me.  Believe that.  I can do it the easy way, right?  I can do it facing me, not facing out.  It's part of my upper body workout regimen.  You still won't do one.  Even facing in, I can't?  No.  Look at your arms, man.  It's $100 on the line.  I can do it.  Those stupid biceps have got to lift your whole body up.  You don't have a hint of a bicep.  Your arms have no clue what $100 is, so they ain't going to help you.  Oh, he loves-  Look at his little arms! 
[01:57:30]  Oh, Sam loves free money, though, so he'll give it a good try.  But look, there's not a hint of a muscle on his arms!  If Jack White's names had more than one syllable each, it would have wrapped around your fucking arm.  You'd be in trouble!  Yeah, how do you make a Jack White tattoo look like a wraparound?  Like an arm band.  Ah, it's tribal work.  Like a tribal, thank you.  That's the fucking joke.  Damn it!  I have high tendon strength.  Is that it?  Your tendons are really powerful.  You better hope. 
[01:58:00]  By the way, everyone's writing in.  This guy pumping Maine goes, Coach Hill, Boston Celtics, knee.  Knee?  I told you!  So many of those knees!  And to this day, I believe these guys, but now, you know what, I think it's their M.O.  Because they're embarrassed.  Yeah.  You know, you're not embarrassed if you're like-  You almost made it, and something beyond your control made you a gym teacher.  And I'm not talking about like the high school football coach, the junior high school football  coach, the junior high school basketball coach, the track and field guy, the gymnastics 
[01:58:30]  coach, all that.  No, I'm talking about the guy that's just fucking, fucking teaching gym.  The gym teacher.  To a bunch of idiots that just-  That don't want to be there.  Wasting 45 minutes to an hour, whatever the fuck it would be.  Hooligans.  Those guys are embarrassed, so they're saying shit like, yeah, you know.  Oh, I could have been.  I was-  Out of my control.  I was this close to playing with Johnny Bench!  Let me tell you the story.  Yeah.  Tell me.  This guy's gym teacher was Chris Mullins' brother.  Oh, lovely this guy. 
[01:59:00]  I know.  Let's with this guy.  That guy's an asshole.  Yeah, he is.  I'm so glad you're into the walking past the window thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've been playing that game for years.  It's terrible.  To myself, even.  Yeah, yeah.  I have a comment about every person that walks by.  We have the blinded by science guy.  Yeah, yeah.  We have the guy that ruined his entire life over something stupid.  And then we got the guy from, what's that fucking, the Canadian guys?  Doug McKenzie. 
[01:59:30]  Bob and Doug McKenzie.  He looks like one of those type of guys.  Yeah, he's trying to be like the cool guy.  He's real gangly and dorky.  Yeah.  And he wears the hat that like hipster would wear.  Yeah, the tassel.  What's his deal?  I don't know.  I think he's one of the engineers.  But he's like an ugly guy, too.  He's not like a good looking guy.  He just went into the room where they listen to us.  Well, he's not.  The ugly one in there.  We're talking about you.  Yeah, let him know.  Real brave, Sam.  We have to fight.  We're going to have to fight your battle like you're our chick. 
[02:00:00]  Get us in a fight now.  Thanks.  I don't have strong arms.  Huh?  I don't have strong arms.  You're the skinniest little man.  I'm not saying I'm an MMA fighter, but compared to Sam Roberts, I certainly am.  Make a little muscle, Sam.  Make a little muscle.  But you're like...  Nothing happens.  Wow.  Like nothing happens.  Everyone has something that moves up.  There's a little something there.  Nothing happens.  There's a little rounding here.  Oh, my God.  So we're going to have to fight your battles like when our chicks get us in trouble.  Yep.  Hey, we got Kevin from Connecticut. 
[02:00:30]  Bravo.  He writes, Coach Hamilton, Boston Patriots, blew out his shoulder.  Yeah.  Blew out his shoulder.  At least it wasn't a knee.  Tito Santana was this guy's gym teacher?  What?  Nah.  Al Matador?  I even remember Tito Santana.  He's a wrestler, of course.  Connor, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, you know how high school you always had like one marking period that was health class  instead of gym?  Health, yes.  Yeah, so we show up one day to health class. 
[02:01:00]  We had a substitute gym teacher come in, and he's got his back to us, this big guy.  He writes his name on the board, Merced Solis.  He turns around, and he goes, hello, my name's Merced Solis.  I'm like, no, you're not.  You're frigging Tito Santana.  What the hell?  And he's like, oh, yeah.  So we spent the rest of the marking period just talking about wrestling stories on the  road.  Oh, my God.  Dream come true, Sam?  If Tito Santana was my teacher, I would go to school all the time.  It would be the greatest thing ever.  So they should make wrestling characters all the teachers in school, and that way people 
[02:01:30]  would just go to class to hang out with them.  You're right.  You're right.  All right, sir.  Tito Santana.  I knew we were going to hear from one gym teacher.  We got Chris in Jersey.  Chris, go ahead, buddy.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Is Jim Norton today or no?  No.  No, he's a busy man.  Oh.  All right, gym teacher, everybody I know who has become a gym teacher has done it because  you can make over $100,000 a year, you get summers off, and you can stand around and 
[02:02:00]  watch a bunch of little 16-year-old girls running around playing.  So, Anthony, it's a perfect job for you.  I know the $100,000 isn't enough money for you.  No.  Watching little girls run around all day?  Come on.  I guess there's equity in that.  You asshole.  Anthony, how's Chris?  No, no.  Just 16-year-olds running around all day.  All right.  Thanks.  Great call.  No, he just sounds like an asshole.  Michelle says they now do yoga and aerobics in gym. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, they got to update the curriculum.  You know, I'm sure they get into, like, the latest fads.  The gym classes in the expensive places, do they have spinning?  Let's hear it.  Spinning classes?  Michelle.  I spit when I said spinning.  Morning.  How do you know they have yoga and aerobics?  I am a high school teacher.  I'm not going to tell you what subject that is.  Oh, come on.  Let me guess.  English.  Oh, how did you guess?  Because you sound very articulate.  It's called taking a stab in the door.  Right.  Listen to Penn. 
[02:03:00]  He'll let you know how I guessed that.  Yeah, you could have said you had some magic powers right there.  You're so intuitive.  Yeah.  Do you unbutton your blouse a little lower than the other teachers?  I knew I was going to walk into this.  Tits.  T-I-T-S.  Tits.  You know, one of my students actually said to me one day,  Mr. Gil, can you, oh, shit, I just said that.  Oh!  Dump out for her.  Too late.  Too late?  Yeah, it's all right. 
[02:03:30]  You know what?  But he said, can you spell, can you spell attic?  And I'm like, yeah, I-T-T.  I-T-T-I-C.  Right.  He nailed you.  I-T-T-I-C.  Ah.  A-T-T-T-I-C.  A-T-T-T-I-C.  Oh, is that an old gag?  Killed her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't remember that.  That's funny.  It's like saying spell I-cup.  Spell it.  Right, exactly.  I-C-U-P.  Well, stop looking at me, then.  No wonder you have no muscles.  I got all the jokes. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So, yeah.  Are you sexy?  Yeah, now that we know your name, maybe you should shut up.  I'm going to, like, I'm going to help you out a little bit today.  Well, I'm going to go to the conglomerate of gym class.  You have yoga, you have spinning, you have summa, you have ziplining, there's rock climbing.  Ziplining?  What?  Hold on.  I wish it opened that up to every nationality, by the way.  How do you zipline in high school?  I did it myself with one of the other gym teachers, and it was a hell of a lot of fun. 
[02:04:30]  They set it up in, I don't know, in the field area.  Really?  Holy shit.  How cool is that?  I bet you needed some fucking, I bet you had to sign off on that for insurance purposes.  I actually didn't have to, but it was a hell of a lot of fun, and I'd do it again.  So it was a special gym thing they did.  Special thing.  But still, that's cool.  You go to school one day, and they go, hey, good news, we're ziplining today.  Holy fuck.  I'm going to hear you say rock climbing?  Rock climbing. 
[02:05:00]  Holy shit.  And we have a wall climbing.  They handed out shitty fucking hockey sticks and made us run around the gymnasium floor playing  floor hockey.  Right.  And that was a good day.  Right.  I threw it on my back at 12 years old, because they decided that hockey sticks had to be really  short.  Yeah.  Oh, it sucked.  Had to go through the rehab.  And I can tell you that my memory of an elementary and middle school gym teacher was an ex-marine  who was dishonorably discharged. 
[02:05:30]  There you go.  Yeah, they are army guys, too, sometimes.  Oh, yeah.  I had one that died in the NAM.  You did?  Yeah, child of the 80s, by the way.  I had, yeah, yeah.  You had a guy that died in the NAM?  Yeah, he went over there for child sex in 1988, and, no, no.  He, yeah, it was a big, it was a big deal.  The gym teacher was going off to war, and he came in in his uniform and everything.  Holy fuck, what a sad story.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  He came into the cafeteria. 
[02:06:00]  It was like the cafeteria.  I remember, like, eating lunch and everything.  And then the principal made an announcement, like, here he is, our hero, and stuff.  And he comes out, and he's all decked out in his fucking uniform.  And the whole place, like, goes in to applause, all these kids fucking clapping and shit like  that.  Like, a few months later.  We regret to inform everybody that.  And they told the kids.  Oh, my God.  Why couldn't they say he moved to California? 
[02:06:30]  He gave his life at the cost of freedom in Vietnam.  How old were you?  This had to be, like, maybe third grade-ish.  You don't tell fourth graders.  It's like when your pet dies and your dad goes, no, we took it to a farm.  It was so fucked up.  You don't tell the truth of when they're in third grade.  Some kids were crying.  Some kids had no idea what was going on anyway.  Right.  Because it's that age where some kids know a little more than others.  And you're sitting there blaming the Democrats, I bet.  I was like, fucking Obama. 
[02:07:00]  Fucking Obama.  People were like, who?  Who?  Oh, don't worry about it.  You'll know soon enough.  You'll know soon enough.  You'll know.  All right, Michelle, you hot, sexy thing.  Get to school.  Yeah.  Keep it clean for me, boys.  All right.  Right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  I know we tell these stories, but I love telling our shit.  Of course we do.  I remember our principal, I think his name was Leon or Leonie.  Maybe someone from Washington Drive School could help me. 
[02:07:30]  And it was very similar to you.  One Monday, we're all in, all happy, getting ready for school.  And the announcement comes over that Mr. Leon died over the weekend.  He was scuba diving out.  I think it was near Riverhead or Waiting River.  He died.  They're still searching for his body.  But we just wanted to tell you guys that he has passed.  I guess they don't want the kids hearing it on the street.  On the street?  You know?  We didn't have Twitter or anything.  We didn't have, like, grief counseling either.  No. 
[02:08:00]  They would just tell you and be like, well, there you go, kids.  That's life.  And in grammar school, you know, the principal was everything.  Yeah.  You know, everyone felt like you had a personal relationship with the principal.  Meanwhile, I'm sitting there, you know, do it for Manny and our gym teacher.  Sal.  But you don't tell us this.  And then I remember as a little thing going, oh, my God, that means everyone dies.  Where's Bobby?  Our heroic gym teacher.  I think he was in the Air Force.  I think he got shot down.  Damn. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Fucking Hanoi.  Goddamn Hanoi Jane was manning the fucking gun herself, I bet.  Damn.  Fucking bitch.  That was my first memory of death, though.  I wanted to do the whole village.  First memory of death, though.  The principal dying.  That's pretty.  It was creepy.  Small little fucking grammar school, and there he goes.  And then there's a new guy.  And I think they introduced the new guy, like, the next day.  Kind of like when your parents try to make it all good with the new pet.  I'm like, no, how about we mourn the old pet for a while?  Don't throw a puppy on our lap a day later.  I looked at, like, the new Darren Stevens that they brought in. 
[02:09:00]  And then every time.  Just keep calling him Darren.  And then every time you saw the principal, you were reminded, oh, that's right.  You're here because the guy we loved is dead.  You're a replacement.  It was creepy, man.  Yeah.  We never really gave him a shot.  Because I remember I was in sixth grade.  It was my last year of grammar school.  So to me, it was like, ugh.  You know?  I'm sure he had a wonderful career, and he ended up being loved by all the students.  But everyone had to be moved.  You know what I mean?  It probably took six years to get all memories out of the old principal that died in the scuba diving accident. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And then he would have a fair chance of being the new guy that everyone could love and appreciate.  But I remember every time looking at the guy, like, oh, God, death.  That's a nice little reminder for a child.  Fucking horrible.  Who was your coolest teacher?  Oh, man.  Actually, my coolest teacher was when I was in California.  She, I talked about this at some point. 
[02:10:00]  She played Jane in the Tarzan and the She-Devil movie.  Can you look that up?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think you've ever said this.  IMDB.  I don't remember this story.  I can't remember her name.  Tarzan and the She-Devil is an old movie.  Yeah.  Boy, this is going to make a bunch of people tell jokes now.  Oh, my God.  The actress was?  It's a black and white poster.  Yes, Miss McKenzie.  Joyce McKenzie.  Google Imager.  Was, uh, she was, oh, that's her, like. 
[02:10:30]  Years later.  Years later.  She was my English teacher.  Really?  Yeah, there she is.  Oh, my God.  She's like a Hollywood starling.  Yeah, she is a star that almost made it.  And that was her big movie.  Holy fuck.  Why do you pick the worst picture always?  It's in color.  Who gives a fuck?  The ones in black and white were way better.  She didn't die in 1949.  Yes, Joyce McKenzie was my teacher at Dana Hills High School. 
[02:11:00]  She's almost good looking.  She's almost good looking.  She was almost a big star.  The problem was she wasn't good looking enough.  And the odd thing is everybody used to, like, goof on the fact that she was in movies and  stuff, but I was fascinated by it.  Yeah, it is.  That's, that's, no.  That looks like, what's her name?  Uh, Mansfield.  With the big tits.  Uh, no, I mean, uh, yeah.  The one, um, uh, the, the, the, the.  Yeah, the one that did the bra commercials.  Jane, Jane.  I was going to say.  Jane Russell.  Russell, thank you.  I was going to.  Oh, that's not her.  No, no, no.  No, no.  Wow, she was your cool teacher. 
[02:11:30]  She was cool.  She was in Hollywood for a moment.  She used to, uh, like, stay after class and, and tell me about, like, Hollywood.  Really?  I was fascinated by it.  Yeah.  Well, it sunk in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not that we're Hollywood, but you're in the entertainment business.  Ah, see?  Well, barely.  As much as she was, I guess.  Tarzan and the she-devil.  Yeah.  Her big part.  She's still alive, by the way.  Still alive.  Why don't you write her a little note?  She wouldn't remember me.  I bet she's got the Alzheimer's.  She's probably fucking calling everyone fucking cheetah and Tarzan. 
[02:12:00]  Imagine that.  She's in the old folks' home, just being inappropriate with black people.  Jesus.  Well, her fucking-  What's your favorite teacher?  Miss McKenzie.  She was very cool.  My favorite teacher was Mr. Fincher.  I wonder if he's still alive.  Oh, Fincher.  Oh, Fincher.  Fincher.  Mr. Fincher was-  Funny.  Fincher was the coolest.  Yeah?  Yeah, because he would open up the gym on weekends. 
[02:12:30]  He was that guy.  For what?  Orgies?  Who knows?  We probably all were touched.  We touched.  You just blocked it out.  We touched.  I went there to play floor hockey, but what we touched-  I hate the fact that you block that shit out, because you always gotta wonder.  You gotta wonder.  Because what adult male opens the gym up for kids on the weekend?  To a kid that's-  Sandusky.  That's 11, 12, I guess, because it was still that grammar school age.  Oh, hairless, right?  It was the coolest thing ever.  Sure.  But you're probably right.  I would feel like a creep if I brought a whole bunch of 11, 12-year-olds to a gym and 
[02:13:00]  said- and was the guy that wanted to spend my weekends in a gym.  Jesus.  You know what, Sam?  You're right.  Fuck Mr. Fincher.  Good.  Terrible.  Peter Weller from RoboCop was my teacher in Syracuse.  I know.  No way!  Yeah, he was.  Let me finish my Mr. Fincher story.  Looking for me.  He, he, uh, yeah, we'd play floor hockey.  Yeah.  How great was that?  I hated the floor hockey.  Huh?  I hated the floor hockey.  Why?  I don't know.  Because it was like a rip-off.  It's like, look, I can't skate, and this is stupid without skating. 
[02:13:30]  But our, uh, gym floor was, uh, slidey.  Was it?  When you're playing your socks?  Well, or then again, maybe, because I had shitty sneakers growing up, I was the only  one being slidey.  Strolls of your sneakers had no grips on them.  One pair of sneakers a year.  They were bowling shoes.  One pair of sneakers a year.  That's not bad, though.  One pair of sneakers.  What were you doing?  For a kid?  It's not bad when you're in your 40s, but when you're like 10, 11, or 12, are you  kidding me?  Yeah, you go through them a lot, huh?  Holes right through the bottom before we got new ones. 
[02:14:00]  I didn't do much sitting in front of the television with sneakers.  Oh, see, no, we were very active, and we got one pair of fucking sneakers a year.  That is a fact.  I didn't, um, yeah.  So they were very, very, uh, very slidey.  Yeah, I didn't, um, I didn't do a lot of physical activity outside of school.  Why?  I was fucking television guy.  You were never, like, outside building forts.  I had to be chased outside.  Fighting other fucking kids in their forts.  When I did go outside, I, you know, did that shit.  But, but for the most part, I liked coming home from school, plopping down in front of 
[02:14:30]  that TV, and just watching everything.  Yeah, but commercials, fucking, I was a TV addict still am.  I still watch six hours of TV a day, but then I got a good six hours outside, I think.  I went outside, but it wasn't imperative.  And I wasn't doing a lot of physical activity outside.  I would, I would go out with, like, my model dinosaurs, and, uh, I would go in the, in  the weeds and be like, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr. 
[02:15:00]  A 22?  That's weird.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I loved my dinosaurs.  Marching, marching.  We should have a muscle-flexing pose-off between E-Rock and Sam,  like they do in the bodybuilding contest.  E-Rock actually had, like, under his fat, he actually has muscles.  No, you could see his muscles.  Yeah.  E-Rock could probably get very fit if he just had a little discipline.  I think, yeah.  Just a fucking iota of don't eat that and a little bit of lift that. 
[02:15:30]  And he would probably.  I just didn't like that Chris guy that called in.  He's probably still listening.  He just sounded like a douchebag.  Yeah.  And I should have called him out on it because Tommy's like,  I'm a physical education teacher.  I definitely don't make anything near 100 grand a year.  Tommy.  And I knew that wasn't true when he said that.  No.  No.  Maybe it's the phys ed teachers that double as, like, the counselor or something.  And you want to hear another horrific story.  Kevin. 
[02:16:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Oh, he's still affected by what he's about to say.  My gym teacher was Chris Mullen's brother.  And if you wanted to see a miserable fucking person, it was Terrence Mullen.  He was supposed to be better than his Hall of Fame basketball playing brother until he blew out his knee in high school.  My buddy, uh, my buddy, buddy, actually.  Buddy knows that, Terrence.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's friends with him.  Yeah.  Is that, is this your call? 
[02:16:30]  I guess he's, I guess he's saying that.  No, but is this your call?  Yeah.  All right.  We have a problem.  Again.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  And I went down this row the other day, and the caller felt bad, but, and he, and then  we, me and him went back on Twitter.  I'm like, no, it wasn't about you.  I mean, and your call's fine, sir.  It's fine.  But it's not the reason why I picked up your call again.  Oh, no.  Just like a couple days ago.  It says on the screen, our coach was an award, and tell me if this is you, and maybe you chose 
[02:17:00]  not to tell the story.  Our coach was at an award show at the gym, and while he was getting his award, he had  a heart attack and died on stage.  Not at all.  Of course.  Oh, my God.  And that's the reason why I took your phone call, so I'm not trashing you personally.  I just had something else in mind when I picked up your phone call.  Was it Sal again fucking up?  Was it Sal?  It was Sal, but Sal's adamantly defending himself.  Sal.  Machine error, not operator error? 
[02:17:30]  Look, I don't like to defend Sal, but it is possible because I've seen comments roll  over from one call to the next.  I don't know.  What if Sal just wrote it in the wrong box?  I'd rather blame Sal.  Yeah, I mean, it's more fun to blame Sal.  Is that comment on two different boxes?  No, because this guy, though, I saw that, I already read his comment that he was, his gym  teacher was Chris Mullen's brother.  So maybe Sal wrote it in the wrong box.  I think Sal wrote it in the wrong box.  I think Sal wrote it in the wrong box.  Sal wants to explain himself.  Sal's a panicky Pete. 
[02:18:00]  I am panicking.  This never works out well.  No, he should not defend himself.  Oh, God, no.  Go ahead, Sal.  What happened, man?  No, the software's kind of buggy, and sometimes it'll duplicate a comment over, and it's  like a known thing.  No, it's known, except to us, Opie, because we're stupid.  That's what Sal just said.  You can see it in there when it duplicates the comment?  Hey, Sam, whatever happened to Sal growing a mustache, by the way?  He just...  Hey!  Can I tell you?  Oh, my God, I'm so glad you brought that up.  He just chose not to do it anymore without asking anybody if he should still continue doing 
[02:18:30]  that.  You remember how stupid my hair looked while it was growing out, right?  Thank you, Anthony.  You're welcome.  He goes...  I asked him last week what happened to the mustache, and he said, you know, I just thought  it looked stupid, and I didn't want to go out like that.  I can't be around a kid like that.  Oh, God.  That's more of that entitled shit.  You remember what Danny looked like an asshole for so long?  Oh, man.  Sal, why wouldn't you just show us a little respect as your elders and go, you know what,  I know you want me to grow a mustache to look like a hipster, but I'm not feeling it 
[02:19:00]  or something.  At least have the conversation.  But he decides.  Or just do it, but it's part of the radio show.  It's part of the show.  Well, that's how it used to work in the past.  We would put these guys in horrible situations, but they would play it out.  We have a million of them that happen over the years.  But Sal just decides on his own without telling anyone that.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what?  I'm not into this.  What are you going to do?  Do you remember when Eastside Day was growing his hair out and we shaved a horseshoe  bald spot in his head?  Oh, God.  And he left it. 
[02:19:30]  Yes.  He left it.  Because it's part of the show.  Eastside Dave, best fucking radio, like, I don't want to say stunt guy because he's  18 billion times more than that.  Right.  But there's no one better at just doing anything.  Because he commits.  He commits and fucking runs with it.  And he became legend.  Legend.  Yes.  I am legend.  They didn't want to pay, what, an extra $2 an hour, so.  Insane how they fucking let him go.  I'm still, I'm reeling over that. 
[02:20:00]  So they let him go from the Ron and Fez show?  Yep.  Ugh.  I'm still reeling from that.  Does this company want to hire a new talent or not?  Or do they want to wait for us to all just fucking die out and then they'll figure it  out?  It's a great question.  Fucking idiots.  Eastside Dave.  How do you let Eastside Dave go and just throw him a little weekend show for a couple  hours a week?  One of the greatest talents.  When he was full-time on Ronnie's show, kickin' ass.  Eastside Dave.  And all he wanted was a little more money so he could afford to get here.  He wasn't even asking for money so he could buy a really nice house for his family. 
[02:20:30]  No.  To get to work.  The deal was, I am spending most of the money I make getting here.  Because he lives down on, you know, in the Jersey Shore there.  So he goes, look, I can't afford to be there anymore, so can you give me a reasonable  raise?  And they said no.  They said no.  And Sal's walking around here with a clean upper lip.  Oh, boy.  I remember years ago, myself, Danny, and a fan all grew mustaches for two weeks.  For Mustache Day.  And not only did you grow them for Mustache Day, they didn't, Opie and Anthony didn't 
[02:21:00]  even make an on-air bit out of it.  No.  It was just fun to have around the hallways.  And we all looked like assholes.  Yes.  Yeah, you did.  But it's more of the same entitled shit.  Sal decided he's done with the bit.  How come Sal's not growing the mustache?  We could easily say, you know what, yeah, maybe do whatever you want.  I don't care.  But the fact is that he doesn't even, like, come to us.  Yeah, why wouldn't you?  How come he's not growing the mustache?  Sal looks stupid, I think.  Right?  Ask him.  Sal?  I'll grow it.  You already said you would. 
[02:21:30]  You said that already.  You're lying again.  I don't need you growing a stupid mustache.  You already said you'd grow it.  No, thank you.  You said that before.  Yeah, fuck it.  Yeah, we're fine.  We're good.  I started to do it and I just didn't like the way it looked.  You just go about your life your way and let me know how it works out in five years.  Yeah, tell us how things are.  And then you can bitch to some stupid fucking reporter about how we treat you bad.  Oh, boy.  How about if Sal wants to make good, all the staff could shave their pubes and then we'll  glue them to Sal's upper lip for a mustache.  Huh?  Pube mustache. 
[02:22:00]  What do you think of that?  Is this a hotline down here ringing?  Why is this phone way down here ringing?  It's just a regular call.  It's just a regular call.  Oh.  I'll screen it.  Why don't you just type something random in the box?  All right.  This guy might be the other guy.  The other guy?  That I wanted.  Troy in Iowa.  Troy.  How's it going, my boy?  What's up, Troy?  I was just tone-fell about it.  Now, the guy was our actual football coach as well. 
[02:22:30]  Okay.  But he was our PE teacher and he was at the awards, the sports awards, and as he's getting  up on the stage receiving his award, he just keels over and has a heart attack right there  on stage.  In front of all the kids?  In front of the kids?  Well, it was a nighttime thing, so it was basically in front of all the players.  Oh, my gosh.  But it was in front of all the family and stuff like that.  And it was a really shitty year that year because we also lost our shop teacher. 
[02:23:00]  What happened to him?  Same thing, part of the fact.  Yeah, those kids will fucking do it to you.  Oh, the worst...  Jesus.  The worst teacher death we had...  I mean, the scuba diving accident at Washington Drive School was tragic.  Al-Qaeda decapitation?  Huh?  Oh, I was just going to say the worst.  That would be pretty bad.  Which one?  Al-Qaeda decapitation?  It was a decapitation.  No way!  Yeah.  Wow, that's bad.  And I don't remember... 
[02:23:30]  It was a few years after I left Washington Drive School.  Yeah.  I believe her name was Mrs. McCutcheon, I think.  I don't want to get this wrong.  She was up in Canada, so the story goes.  Oh, no.  And you know it snows a lot up there, right?  It certainly does.  This is the story that was told.  And if it's true, I don't know.  You want to turn the lights out and put a flashlight up to your face while you tell this?  It was a dark night.  Supposedly, she was enjoying Canada for whatever reason. 
[02:24:00]  I don't know if she was from there or vacationing.  I don't know.  Sounds impossible already.  I have no idea.  But, uh, snowy out.  She's in her car.  I believe she was with somebody else.  And, um, well, she either skidded out of control or the plow skidded out of control.  Oh, no.  A plow?  While the plow was up.  Oh.  And the story goes, she was decapitated again.  I'm like, holy fuck.  Wow.  That's pretty bad.  A snow plow decapitation. 
[02:24:30]  Yes.  It's got to be pretty thorough.  Yes.  That's not one of those Dale Earnhardt, you know.  Technically, it was a decapitation.  That's fucking.  That's fucking.  That's gone.  Your head is fucking in the snow pile on the side of the road.  But, you know.  Yikes.  It could have been one of those telephone games where maybe it was something way more normal or whatever.  Right.  Or not as horrific.  Over the years.  Over the years.  I don't know.  That's like the story around my neighborhood about Stoneface the cop.  Stoneface the cop.  Stoneface the cop was, you know, it's like, oh, look out. 
[02:25:00]  Stoneface.  He was the cop you didn't want to get fucking pulled over or harassed by or anything.  Right.  He was this old guy with pure white fucking hair.  And he'd drive around.  And the story was, Stoneface was just a rookie cop a few years back.  And he was driving around.  And he saw a horrific accident.  Drunk teens smeared all over the road.  Overnight, his hair turned pure white.  And he was old.  And he was only 30 years old.  But he looked like he was in his 40s. 
[02:25:30]  Right.  Because he was old.  And you never fucking wanted to do anything that was dangerous and have Stoneface catch you.  Right.  Driving drunk, driving recklessly.  Because he would throw the book at you because he felt so bad and wanted to prevent that scene that he saw so many years ago.  So that put him, made his hair turn white overnight.  And you were 34 at the time.  Uh, yeah.  Hanging out at Leahy fucking elementary school playground.  You think these assholes, like, make up these stories behind the scenes? 
[02:26:00]  He must have laughed his balls off at the fact that, dude, I'm Stoneface.  Cool.  I get to be Stoneface.  Like in the locker room at the fucking precinct.  Right.  Probably like, hey, Stoneface.  All right, this is the deal.  Fuck you, asshole.  You know, drunk driving's way up with teens.  Yeah, yeah.  We got an idea.  I'm Stoneface.  We learned this at the police convention.  I'm only 30.  In Des Moines.  They come back with these, uh, ideas.  Yeah.  Hmm.  We had a cop named Bullethead.  Bullethead.  That's pretty funny.  Bullethead. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, we, with the P.E. teachers that were, uh, women, lesbians, we've done that bit a million fucking times.  Yeah.  A million fucking times.  Yeah.  But it is true.  In, um, Harborfields High School, the, uh, the gym teachers had a, uh,  office in the actual locker room with the glass, with the glass.  Like, the three sides of their office was glass that looked right into the, uh, the locker room.  Yeah.  And, uh, and when I went to Harborfields High School, there were suspicions that our female gym teacher was certainly, uh, you know, gee. 
[02:27:00]  They love the pussy.  Well, we grew up in an age where, uh, you weren't basically, you weren't basically allowed to say you were a B.E.  You didn't say shit that spiky fucking hairdo they would have.  But you kind of knew there was something going on.  And I don't know.  Maybe, maybe that's not true.  So, but I always thought it was hilarious that her job was to, as a gay woman.  Yeah.  Looked like she was probably, if I look back now, she's probably late thirties, early forties. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, boy.  And, uh, she wasn't really allowed to express her sexuality.  No.  She went to a job where she went into the female locker room into her glass office every day.  And I remember as a kid thinking that could be the greatest job you could ever have in life.  Oh, my God.  For a guy or a lesbian woman, it's perfect.  Right.  Jeez.  And no one was the wiser.  Nope.  Can you imagine what was going through her head as she's driving to the high school every day? 
[02:28:00]  She gets there early every day.  Best job ever.  Holy.  You name a better job than that if you're in that situation.  Holy shit.  You're looking at the 15, the 16.  Well, high school, 16, 17, 18-year-olds.  Jesus Christ.  Just stripping down to nothing because they think they're in a safe environment.  She must have been sitting on meringue all day.  Just fucking, just loving life.  Just looking out at the locker room? 
[02:28:30]  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Fantastic.  Just yelling and screaming during your commute because you're stuck in traffic because you want to get there so bad.  Yep.  Oh, lovely.  And then Ant does that wonderful bit we don't have to do here.  Oh, we don't have the whistle anymore.  Yeah, that was the one.  We should find that bit and replay it.  Ant's done it a bunch of times over the years.  She can't blow the whistle.  I forgot about that bit. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like fucking...  If you can find the...  Kate Winslet at the end of Titanic trying to blow the whistle because she's so turned on.  She's trying to blow her gym whistle, but she's shaking with fucking just sexual energy.  She's so horned up.  She can't blow the whistle anymore.  If you can find that, we haven't played that in years.  I don't know that one.  Why make Ant redo it if we could just play the tape?  Of course.  If you find it, that would be great. 
[02:29:30]  E-Rock's home.  Call him up.  Tell him where the fuck the file is.  I got lucky with teachers, though.  Skated around the them dropping dead issue pretty well.  Only that one guy from the NAMM.  That's a horrific...  Wonder how he went.  Bouncing Betty, maybe?  Maybe punchy sticks?  It's horrible.  What'd he do?  Or do you just roll a Jeep over, pulling out of the motor pool?  What happened?  I think in a way, we bitch about how kids are being raised.  I think we're raising a lot of wimps with all the PC shit. 
[02:30:00]  But then there's also things like, why would you tell a third grader that one of the cool  teachers died at NAMM?  And there was no one to go to.  That's what I'm saying.  Look, I'm feeling really sad about the gym teacher you just announced for getting fucking  killed in the NAMM.  Maybe...  Can I talk to someone about this?  We're talking about this.  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  I'm just the principal.  Right.  I'm just giving you the info. 
[02:30:30]  I'm a bean counter at this school.  I don't know about kids.  That's all on you, little fucker.  Deal with it.  Suck it up.  Walk it off.  Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  You said you were in third grade?  Yeah, it was like fourth, maybe.  So that's like 10-ish.  Yeah, 10, 11.  How does a 10-year-old deal with death like that?  You watch fucking John Wayne and the Green Berets and realize, hey, he was kicking ass.  Oh, my God.  That's what he's doing.  He's over there saving, making our life safe for democracy.  So when you learn, especially at that age, someone died, it puts you in a horrific, lonely, scary place. 
[02:31:00]  Petrifying.  Just a petrifying place.  And then I didn't know.  I thought the fucking Vietnamese were coming over here.  Because we had like air raid drills in my school where it wasn't like the fire drill.  It would just go, boop.  And you'd be like, ah, the fire drill was the bell.  It was like, bring, bring, bring.  And the red bell was in the school, in the hallway.  And you're like, all right, that's the fire drill.  But the air raid siren thing was this little speaker all around the school. 
[02:31:30]  These little fucking scary little speakers.  And it would go, boop.  And you'd be like, ah, and you'd have to get under the desk.  Right.  It was petrifying.  I'm like, wait, why do people want to drop bombs on us?  Where is school?  We had to go, we were lame.  We just had to go in the hallway.  Yeah.  And stand up against the cement walls.  Well, that happened later on in life.  They would put the elementary, the younger children in the corner between the wall and the floor.  Right.  And they would duck down in a little ball. 
[02:32:00]  And then you would be on, like, your knees over them.  Like, and put your hands against the wall.  Put your head against your hands.  That was sex.  Protecting the, well, no.  That was sex.  It was something you don't.  You were so petrified that the bombs were coming.  Well, that's why.  You're thinking it was a drill.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how they trick you when they're molesting you.  You thought you were doing some kind of air drill thing.  No, no.  You were having heinie sex with the younger kids.  When that was going on.  As the teacher got off on it. 
[02:32:30]  That's what happened.  Yeah, maybe that's what was going on.  When that was going on, I was the older kid that had to protect the younger kid.  Right.  I never was the younger kid.  Because when I was the younger kid, we just went under our desks.  The bomb-proof desks that have been goofed about so many times.  Well, it's on your desk.  It's okay.  Yeah, it's hack.  Because in the end, if there was some, God forbid, bombing, that dumb desk wasn't going to protect you.  I guess they were more concerned about breaking glass and those ceiling tiles coming down on your head than an actual direct hit with a bomb. 
[02:33:00]  From the, from the, it was the time, can I say, do you think?  Oh, sure.  No, I can't say.  What were you going to say?  Gooks.  That's a bad one.  No, it could be the Chinese.  They were very scary at the time.  It was part of the Cold War.  But it was mostly the Russians.  I'm just going back to time.  That's what they would say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Blah, blah, blah.  They would.  Sorry if I offended you.  That was part of the vernacular of the time.  Yes.  But that's what the commies were called, man.  There was a constant, I remember going to sleep at night at some times and just thinking, like, 
[02:33:30]  there could be a nuclear missile heading this way right now.  Oh, really?  And we wouldn't know anything about it.  Yeah, I was kind of consumed with atomic war and the thought that there was a gun pointing at us,  a figurative atomic gun, all the time.  That was your biggest fear?  What's that, Sam?  Hold on.  What's that?  No, no, no.  I was just going to say, at what age?  Oh, boy.  It had to be one.  All right, look.  Shut up.  No, but that was your biggest fear when you slept at night? 
[02:34:00]  Let me tell you something.  For many years?  Yes.  That was at one of the top of the list.  No, because I got one.  Uh-huh.  My biggest fear when I was at that weird age where you just knew you couldn't really take care of yourself,  I was worried about David Berkowitz.  The son of Sam?  Yes.  Child of the 80s.  I was convinced that there was a possibility that he could kill me and my entire family.  David Berkowitz was a scary motherfucker at the time.  He was a scary motherfucker. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  He was killing women in cars.  44-caliber killer.  That's right.  But he was loose out there somewhere, and the news told you, man, he's a dangerous man,  and he's loose out there.  And then a few days would go by, and there would be another couple killed in a car somewhere,  and it horrified me.  And I was convinced that he could fucking come into our house and do damage to me and my family.  People would park on the side of the streets in the boroughs, mostly, of New York City.  Queens, right?  Queens, Brooklyn.  A lot of Queens.  And they'd park to make out, and the son of Sam, David Berkowitz, would come up with 
[02:35:00]  his .44-caliber revolver to the back window and just blast him in the fucking head.  You're right.  It was petrifying, and every so often it was like, holy shit, you hear he struck again last  night.  Right.  And people were scared to just do anything.  It was one of the scariest times.  Crazy.  For New York City, as far as that shit goes.  He turned out to be a fat Jewish mailman.  Right.  From Yonkers.  From fucking Yankees.  Who has since found Gwad.  Westchester.  He has found Gwad.  Bestchester.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  That was my fear when I went to sleep at night. 
[02:35:30]  No, I didn't care, because I was out on Long Island.  I was in Suffolk County.  That's where I was.  That's what I'm saying.  I know.  Pretty far from the fucking action.  My point is, yeah, exactly.  How stupid is that?  I was far from the action.  I was a teenager, not making out yet.  I wasn't in cars in the middle of the night.  Really didn't fit the MO at all.  Of course not.  But it scared the shit out of me every night.  I wasn't going out to Long Island and breaking into houses.  No, I would wake up in the middle of the night, like, ah, okay, he's not here.  And go back to sleep.  Yeah, I just thought of the nuclear bombs that were all pointing toward us. 
[02:36:00]  You really did?  Because there were just so many aimed right at us.  Oh, you were alive for the Cuban Missile Crisis.  No, I wasn't.  Sixth grade?  Wait a minute.  I might have been alive for it, but I wasn't.  I better check the date on that.  I don't remember it, though.  Okay.  I was alive for it.  I don't remember it.  I was a mere youngster.  Yeah, but that's when they were really worried about fucking missiles and stuff.  You want to hear a right look?  You want the most horrific teacher story? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to call this the most horrific teacher story.  Mike has it.  Mikey.  Yeah, I'm here.  Go ahead, man.  In 1974, third grade, they told us that one of our teachers was drugged out of her car,  and they poured gasoline on her and lit her on fire because she'd pissed off some gang members  in Cucamonga, California.  Cucamonga?  What?  Who told you that?  Like, the principal told you that? 
[02:37:00]  No, they announced that she had died over the weekend, and then later on it was in the  paper, and our parents decided to sit down and tell us what exactly.  Oh, my God.  Why would you?  Why we should be careful.  Venture out after dark.  Well, that's just as scary, I guess, but.  That's pretty bad.  You got to sugarcoat that a little bit.  They didn't.  Not back then.  I mean, that was just a matter-of-fact thing.  And, Anthony, you grew up a little bit in California, the Skid Row Slasher.  Our parents were blunt with us about that. 
[02:37:30]  Well, I was in San Juan Capistrano.  Not much happened there, as far as, I wasn't in L.A. or anything, you know.  All right.  All right.  Great story, bro.  You know, not far out of L.A., but, you know, just all kinds of crazy stuff.  Like, I had to worry about parties at Jimmy Jackson's house where some crazy Indian was  going to stab me with his knife because his wife wanted to have sex with me.  That's what I had to worry about.  But, one other thing real quick.  The thing that scared me the most when I was in grade school was the sheriff's helicopter 
[02:38:00]  shining that damn light into the house at night as they were chasing somebody through  your backyard.  All right.  Growing up on Long Island, we never had that.  World star hip-hop, yo.  We never had the helicopters in the air with the fucking searchlights.  No, the only time I ever saw helicopters out on Long Island was if there was a giant  wreck on the fucking expressway or something.  Right.  It was never to look for criminals.  No, never.  Just to clean up the mess.  I was already stressed out.  Oh, go ahead, sir.  They would use the sheriff's helicopter to chase people that were running from the cops  and they're searching the backyard. 
[02:38:30]  And as a little kid, I actually had this nightmare that the devil was in the helicopter.  There was no way to get away from him.  So the guy on the ground, the devil, is in the helicopter.  That's it.  All right.  Good stories, bro.  Thank you, sir.  Let's see.  In high school, our security guard got life in prison for rape.  There you go.  Junior high school, one of the special ed teachers got crushed by the special ed bus.  That's ironic.  When I was in elementary school, they used, thank you, they used, they moved to California 
[02:39:00]  as code for the teacher dying.  And I would get suspended for telling the kids what that meant.  Because he figured it out.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Okay, I got to take this one.  Tim on Long Island.  Tim.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I was telling Sal.  When I was in elementary school, we had two gym teachers who were both Vietnam vets.  And they used to play a little game of dodgeball, but they'd modify it. 
[02:39:30]  And they would call it Ho Chi Minh Trail.  And they would stack those little foldable gymnastic mats that they can fold up and put them in the corner.  They would stack, kind of fold them up, stand them up on the side, make little tunnels.  You would run through those tunnels.  And at the end, when you're going to throw the ball, they would scream crazy war things at you.  And you had to throw the ball completely at people.  And it was basically like full metal jacket.  That sounds great.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:40:00]  I feel like something is happening.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Serious XM.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, asshole.  You guys suck.  Serious XM.  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock.  And we're playing some old bits that maybe you haven't heard in a long time.  Maybe it's new to you.  Maybe you've only started listening to us in the past couple of years.  Maybe you started today.  If so, well, I'm sorry that you picked today of all days to join us.  But hopefully you will enjoy this segment. 
[02:40:30]  A lot of guys on the show, pretty much every American male or Canadian male or Australian male or British male or wherever you're listening to us in this great world of ours, likes to watch porn.  Some like watching anything that has to do with porn.  Some have very specific tastes.  Well, a lot of the guys don't watch black porn on our show, namely Anthony.  But we figured why not take a look at it and see maybe there's something we're missing.  And who better to watch black porn with?  Patrice O'Neill and Louis C.K. 
[02:41:00]  I just blew your mind.  This is the worst of all you have in the Serious XM.  I don't know why, but I've never seen a black woman that gave me a porn.  The only black woman that I find attractive is like, yeah, white-looking black women.  Let me ask you this.  Like a white woman with a tan.  Ghetto black.  Yeah, okay.  Ghetto black is where it's at.  Is it insecurity thinking that all black women like big, giant dicks?  No, because I do have kind of a big dick.  You're packing? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  I don't believe that at all.  I have a nice dick and a pretty big dick.  Really?  I've been told by enough women that I believe it now.  I've been told by that, but it's not true.  Wait, Louie, who was playing you that day?  I'm lucky Louie then.  What?  Oh, shit.  Oh, well, you know, it was flaccid and it was afraid of the camera.  But when it started to race, but it grows into something.  I can't help it.  It's not something I have a control over.  It's something I have any control over.  A nice shave.  But I'm going to be quite honest to you.  I only like mix something. 
[02:42:00]  I don't like a full-blooded nothing anymore.  Right.  I know what you mean.  I'm full-blooded anybody.  Your girl doesn't look full black.  My girl's half something.  Yeah.  I'm attracted to half something.  Exactly.  Half something.  Half something.  Full Asian does nothing.  Full white women.  It's just I enjoy a mixture.  You need some conglomerated mongrel.  Yes, indeed.  I think it's what you grow up with because I still, all my fantasies still were built when  I was 10.  I'm still going on those.  Yeah.  You know, so fucking age-wise.  I know blonde cheerleaders and older Jewish women. 
[02:42:30]  Still the two things I like the most.  Who else is racist again?  You said you're racist again.  I am, but you can figure that.  Yeah, there's certain, like, I don't like, probably, like, Asian.  I don't like really, unless they're mixed with something.  They've got to be kind of Amerasian.  You know, something like that.  I've met black women that I've flirted with and that I've really gotten, like, a crush on,  but then I think about fucking them and then my dick won't get hard. 
[02:43:00]  And I can't control that.  What kind of fucking Nazi?  That's awful.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Like, as far as black chick goes, maybe Francine.  I'm talking pussy.  Yeah, maybe Francine.  Not dating.  I'm talking about pussy, too.  I'm talking about pussy, too.  But she's crazy.  I wish I could.  She's got to cave her head in with a hammer when you're done.  I'm ashamed.  I'm ashamed of my dick.  I've jerked off.  You don't jerk off the black porn?  No.  What?  I've never looked at black porn.  You're a piece of shit.  Inadvertently, I've looked at black porn and gone like, her father must be so fucking upset. 
[02:43:30]  Jesus.  You're talking about a white girl with a black eye.  With two hands full of mouth and ass.  What are you?  We're not talking about black dick.  We're talking about black pussy.  Yeah.  You're missing a lot.  When I'm looking through porn.  Like a chick like that?  A black chick?  I'm not into, like, dark black chicks.  Where's this fucking fan at right now?  Fan.  I don't know.  They figured we're doing all the heavy lifting today.  Hey, fan.  We need you.  Come on. 
[02:44:00]  When I'm looking at porn and I see...  Brown and round.  Brown and round.  You're going to show me shit that might as well be two girls, one cup.  Dude, we did brown and round last time, didn't we?  No.  No, we did fat fucking...  We did mysweetfatty.com.  A whole other story.  My sweet fatty.  Today, it's brown and round.  When I'm surfing porn.  It's brown and brown.  I agree.  Right there, you wouldn't stick your fucking dick in that...  What the fuck?  No.  Are you fucking kidding me, man? 
[02:44:30]  No.  Now, here's the thing.  I mean, I have been jerked off by black hookers.  Oh, God damn.  What the fuck is that?  I closed my eyes and thought about white people.  See, she's pretty light.  Yeah, she's not black.  Is that a white woman?  Are all of you fucking the same way?  These women are...  I'm with you, Patrice.  That's kind of light.  Are you looking at that?  Look at that giant, pretty, giant asshole.  I don't want a giant, pretty, giant asshole.  Just that beautiful little asshole on that giant ass with the pink twat. 
[02:45:00]  Are you not well?  Are you that racist?  I know.  Something's wrong.  See, we're different as people.  I don't think there's any points.  Like, if you went to hairymongolianbitches.com...  Look...  Oh, my God.  All right, yeah, but that...  Oh!  Look at that.  Are you fucking joking?  That's a little scary now, there.  That ain't...  Patrice, you just lost...  A big, oily asshole?  Are you...  That's scary?  Just how it moves.  You're losing me now.  What is that?  You're losing me.  It's a giant, oily asshole. 
[02:45:30]  That's intimidating right there, man.  It looks like a fucking CAT scan of a heart.  They are moving that ass.  It looks like it's going to eat your...  It looks like it's going to eat your dinner or something, man.  Feed me.  Do you know how fucking fast my face would be in...  Just...  That was like a high cholesterol...  Patrice, I was with you, but this is scaring me.  This is way too much...  Whoa!  That's scaring you?  There's too much extra meat on the ass.  That's scary?  All you motherfuckers are gay. 
[02:46:00]  No, that...  Those big, fat...  That's scary.  A fat, black ass ain't doing it for me.  That's scary.  It looks like a centipede's mouth saying,  Hello, hello, hello, hello.  Like a Muppet.  Right.  Skinny white bitches...  Mm-hmm.  Don't do anything for me.  Meaning, I don't look at them and go,  Oh!  But...  Oh, fuck one!  Like...  And I'll do the same thing to a skinny white bitch  that I would do to this bitch right here!  No, I need to be fucking visually excited.  I would say the same thing. 
[02:46:30]  I could certainly work up a boner  and fuck one of these girls,  but I wouldn't, uh...  Really, as a favorite of them?  Sure!  Sure!  Hey, I'll throw you this.  I'll throw you this.  Totally.  Here you go, nigglet!  I'm gonna try to get...  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Oh my gosh.  You'll have a good time.  I'll have a nice steak.  I'm white.  That's hilarious.  But, uh...  Alright, round and broad.  But when I see them, I don't get hurt.  Wait, what about that one?  That one's alright.  What, all the way up into the right?  She's white.  White chicks. 
[02:47:00]  No, the second one down,  there's some something else in there.  That's white.  These are white chicks.  I was looking for...  Now we're just looking at porno.  Now we're just looking at...  To me, this is porno.  I was reprimanded for not looking at porno fast enough,  so I'm just trying to be ahead of it.  Before, I didn't consider that porno.  I don't know what that was.  ExploitedBlackTeens.com  ExploitedBlackTeens?  This is like precedent cases in a courtroom.  Yes.  Oh, your honor.  I cite the case of ExploitedBlackTeens.com 
[02:47:30]  Let's bring it up, please.  Let's submit it.  What the fuck, Patrice?  The defense calls ExploitedBlackTeens.com  Are you sure we got it right?  This looks like one of those general bullshit says.  Okay.  Warning.  Warning.  Warning.  Warning.  Let's see.  You're about to see pussy.  Now this might have something to...  Okay, now you add the young and fragile  and they get interesting.  It's true.  She's ugly, though.  Yeah, she's a little fucking...  No, she's not.  She's all right.  I like her.  With the jizz across the face. 
[02:48:00]  This racism bothers me.  No, this isn't racism.  This is pure...  Sean Bell doesn't bother me as much.  Wow.  Jesus Christ, that guy is laying some silly string.  Holy shit.  What was that, a home invasion?  What the hell is that?  She looks like Brandy.  That chick looks like Brandy a little bit.  Come on, dude.  Look at this girl.  She's not bad.  She looks like the daughter in the first Lethal Weapon.  I found her kind of cute.  Yeah, she was cute.  I changed it from giant, greasy black booties moving...  Which shows you that it ain't the color of the skin.  It's the content of the ass. 
[02:48:30]  It is the color of the skin.  If I could quote Martin Luther King.  Look at this girl right here.  Are you fucking joking?  No, this girl...  All right, that ain't bad either, right?  No, these girls are all sex.  She looks like that Raven Simone fucking chick.  So does she.  So does she.  So does she.  So does she.  Wait a minute.  Go back.  Go back one.  The one with the sweat sock.  The one with the sweat sock.  The one with the sweat sock.  That's really sexy.  A very dark black girl with tube socks from the 70s.  Yeah, with the ABA socks.  All right. 
[02:49:00]  She's pretty dark.  Look.  Look.  She's very dark.  That's it.  I'll give it to you, Patrice.  Yeah, she's really pretty.  And Jemima wig on.  That's right.  Jesus Christ.  That's right.  She's got the Boston Celtics.  Yeah, that's the thing.  She has to be in context.  She looks like a white chick that's really tan.  That's what it is.  And that's fine by me.  You don't fucking make me sick.  I don't like the big fat asses.  These motherfuckers make me really sick, man.  It has nothing to do with race.  We're proving it has nothing to do with race.  You're not.  Do you realize...  Do you realize saying, oh, as long as the little nigglet has long socks on and a police 
[02:49:30]  hat, I'll fuck it.  I can't...  No, that looks good.  Look, I'll cop to it that it's racist.  I can't help it.  How is it...  I'm not going to cop to being racist on this.  But why...  I'm sexually...  I am.  I can't help it.  I can't help that I don't get a bonus from certain people.  And you know what?  You have access.  Oh, my God.  That looks like Urkel.  That looks like fucking Urkel with tits.  I'm also prejudiced against bad people.  Look at fucking Urkel taking a load on the face.  Did you just fucking call her Urkel?  Look at her taking a load on the face.  That's Urkel. 
[02:50:00]  That is the sexiest thing I've seen all year.  That pretty girl.  That's Urkel.  She looks a little manly, Patrice.  She got a mustache.  She looks manly with those little deer eyes looking up at cum.  Deer eyes.  Deer eyes.  There's a lot of eyebrows there.  And those tits ain't doing me justice.  Oh, you...  Fuck you.  What?  I'm just done with you.  The nipples look like the flying saucers from Mars Attacks.  See, they're not witchy anymore because they know this is too racist.  One joke bombed.  Fuck you.  They're with me.  No, no, no.  Not the bombing. 
[02:50:30]  Your racism is just too much.  How come I liked the black chick?  I fucking liked that.  I didn't like the fat ass.  You didn't.  I liked the black chick.  You put them in context.  And I want you to explain your racism to why.  I don't know why.  I mean, I just don't get hard.  Blacks on blondes.  Yeah, this is really going to fucking make me happy.  This is a Steve C. suggestion.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Oh, here we go.  Yeah, this is great.  But she's not blonde.  What went wrong?  This should be called, I wanted my father to shoot himself. 
[02:51:00]  Well, no joke.  The other link he sent me was daddysworstnightmare.com.  Oh, get out of here, really?  Yeah, let me go to it.  Fucking Steve.  Yes, daddysworstnightmare.  Get Steve in here.  Steve is the expert.  It's either another site like this or him bringing girls home.  It's the same, though.  It's like a black.  I don't get turned on by fat women.  Right.  So why would it be white or fat?  You can put white fat asses up there.  I ain't going to fucking like it either.  It's the sexual aesthetic thing. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, God.  Ladies and gentlemen, the expert on porn.  Yes.  Steve.  Steve, sir.  Hold on a second.  Try my daddy.  My daughter's banging blackzilla.com.  Blackzilla.  A whole sentence website, sir.  Yeah, this guy, Blackzilla, just his helmet is eight inches, I think.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Ah, shit.  Maybe that's not it.  Hold on.  Oh, damn.  Google, Google that sentence.  Wait.  You know Blackzilla?  Patrice.  I know his work. 
[02:52:00]  He's packing.  It's not hard to figure out.  I don't think he breathes fire.  He knows his specs.  Yeah.  His specs.  I know I'm familiar with his, you know.  There you go.  Oh, boy.  All right.  We're getting Blackzilla on the screen.  Here we go.  It was one of them.  I want to see, uh...  Oh, that's one of those fucking scents.  Ah, shit.  If I'm what?  If I'm sure...  Oh, come on.  I sent you two good ones.  Thanks for nothing.  Oh.  Oh.  See, I told you.  Holy mother of...  Oh, God damn. 
[02:52:30]  What the fuck?  That looks like a mugging.  Is that why you carry a gun?  That's it.  Just in case fucking Blackzilla comes in.  He could...  And bangs on your door with his cock.  He doesn't have to.  He could just take his cock and use it like No Country for Old Men.  That fucking thing.  He just banged the lock out of your door.  With his dick.  As he fucking...  He's fucking into a pussy goes,  Fave, friendo.  Holy shit.  Oh, get out of here. 
[02:53:00]  Wow.  That's like that horse cock that killed that gay guy.  Yeah.  That's the only thing we got out of slavery is porn.  Porn is on reparations.  Yeah, see?  That's not right.  Wow.  Look at her face.  She's sucking on that cock.  It's like sideways in her mouth.  Her face is just...  It's a horrified look.  Okay, terrific.  Imagine that.  I would say that's another way that I'm...  I mean, if I'm surfing porn...  Another racist thing. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, another racist thing about me.  Is to see a black cock in a woman.  If I see...  Of course.  If I'm surfing porn and there's a big black cock,  to me it's like stumbling on gay porn.  And I'm like, oh, well, just keep moving.  Just keep moving.  But if you see a white cock,  you think there might be some chicks involved,  so it's okay to look at it.  I have no problem watching a white guy  fucking black girl on porn.  You motherfuckers are awful.  Just awful.  What?  Then you at least know her rent's gonna get paid.  Pussy should be the thing...  Pussy should be the thing...  Pussy should be the thing that... 
[02:54:00]  That crosses all boundaries.  That bring us all together.  Bring us all together?  I know.  Like, I have a dream.  There's no conversation that a guy...  Guys should go...  Here's the conversation.  It's like...  My friend will go,  hey, look at this chick.  And I go,  ah, her head's kind of big.  He goes, would you fuck her?  I go, that has nothing to do with it.  That's what the conversation should be  when it comes to pussy.  Like, oh yeah, black girls don't turn me on,  but I'll fuck the shit out of them.  That's more to do with your sexual fucking obsession.  I don't fuck them.  It's just that they're not the thing  that gets my dick hard right away. 
[02:54:30]  I'll go with that.  That's all.  If there were no other women left  on the face of the earth  and I needed to fucking cum...  There was no other women.  By the way...  They just needed something,  a dumpster.  Right, just to like dump a load in.  I'd be happy.  They're just above a cup.  Yeah.  Well, what kind of cup?  There are cups.  Fake china.  There are cups that are nicer.  There's some pretty cups out there.  There's some cups out there that are...  There's like black women...  There's like some kind of cups,  black women,  other kind of cups.  Like that's the way the... 
[02:55:00]  Certain kind of cups.  You know, I don't think we've done...  I don't think we've done much today  to bring the races together.  No.  I don't think my birthday  is really bringing the races together.  Usually me and Patrice  will have discussions  and I think at the end of the day  it kind of helps bring us,  give us a more mutual understanding  of each other.  I think we've gone a couple of steps back today.  Well, the pussy thing bothers me.  That really bothers you.  Because that is just something.  Don't you understand  it has more to do  with your sexual obsession  than it does us not liking 
[02:55:30]  certain types of women,  sexually?  You know why I think it is?  You'll fuck anything.  You transcend race  because you'll fuck anything.  Well, I'll fuck anything.  Most guys will fuck anything.  I'll fuck anything too.  Not absolutely true.  Under certain circumstances,  he will at the drop of a hat.  When you say anything...  That's why he bought a hat  so he could drop it  and fuck something.  Fuck people.  Not anything is the problem.  Like some guys might not  fuck a certain level.  Like they won't go into a nine.  We're talking...  We're not talking  like ugly and this and that.  We're talking racially. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  You have problems  getting horny  with a black 10.  I found those black skinny chicks  attractive.  Okay.  Definitely.  Listen to how you're saying it.  Brown and round  were not black 10.  Brown and round.  Those were not black 10.  No, I won't be tentative then.  Those are black 10s.  I'll say they were hot.  See, everybody's got  a different scale.  Those are black 10s.  Black 10s,  those fucking fat ass ones?  And the black community.  Oh my God.  They are covered just like white guys  covet tall, skinny white women.  I don't.  They do nothing for me. 
[02:56:30]  I will fuck one  because they exist.  Okay, so that's exactly  the same then.  That's exactly the same.  The only thing you won't fuck  in the reverse.  And then it's like a Yeti.  So you're admitting  to the same prejudice  as us then.  Yeah.  No.  That the women that you  think white people  hold in the highest esteem,  the tall...  That is not the same.  You just said they don't  do anything for you.  But you don't go like this.  But listen,  if I go,  look,  skinny white bitches,  especially ones like that  have the bone in the pelvis,  like you can see 
[02:57:00]  the pelvic bone.  Yeah.  That bothers me.  But you go,  she has a pussy  and she,  you know she looks good  to something else.  Yeah.  Or someone else.  It's like,  hey, you know,  white guys love this.  Not my thing.  Bend over, bitch.  Right.  Like, it's like,  look at those black,  greasy asses.  Nah, it does nothing for me.  But you know what?  Black, greasy ass.  Here we go.  Pussy is the ultimate denominator  out of all of it.  And I can't believe you go yucky.  Yeah, but you have your preferences.  Don't you have to find something  aesthetically pleasing 
[02:57:30]  when you're fucking it?  Do you want to look down  at some fucking ass  and go like,  uh, aesthetically pleasing?  But that is aesthetically pleasing.  Aesthetically pleasing to you.  I'm only saying the same thing  you're saying about  skinny white girls,  that these girls  with the big black asses,  there you go.  They're not my preference,  but I would fuck all of them.  That bothers you.  Let me say,  that's great.  She has a big ass.  That's the same ass  that you went ill to  except for  I didn't say ew.  on a negative picture.  I didn't say ew.  It's the negative.  It's the negative version  of that black ass.  Keep going.  Let me see something else.  It's the same ass. 
[02:58:00]  Look at that shit.  It's the same exact ass.  I do prefer  a big white ass  to a big black ass.  You a motherfucker, man.  Yeah.  That's the same shit  Hitler probably said.  Yeah, I gotta say.  I gotta say,  you're right.  I think I do prefer  a bigger white ass  to a big black ass.  See the girl  with the bunny ears  and the big ass?  Yeah, that's awesome.  I love that.  Are you fucking joking?  I would never disrespect  a fat ass.  I would never disrespect  Madness  by going yucky  to that.  Love that.  That's the same ass 
[02:58:30]  as fucking fucking  I know, but they're white.  Are you fucking joking me?  Yeah, but they're white.  They're white.  He's telling you,  yes, but they're white.  They're white.  Look, white.  White ass.  Look at the blonde hair.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at these fucking assholes.  These are good.  They're good.  That girl was on  the fucking screen.  They're white.  That was like,  oh, oh, look at this.  I know.  Deliciousness.  Don't worry,  ladies and gentlemen.  Those chains  are made of tinsel steel. 
[02:59:00]  This is the worst  of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  What is going on?  This is the worst  of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Better yet,  the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is Iroch  and I am hosting this thing  since Opie and Anthony  are not here.  And no,  your radio is not fucked up.  I am just moving  left to right  on the microphone  as I stand here  recording all of this  for you.  Sex addiction. 
[02:59:30]  A lot of us have it.  A lot of us don't.  Mostly people  don't have this addiction,  but there are some  that do,  namely Jim Norton,  Rich Voss,  Robert Kelly.  All at their names  on Twitter.  Pretty easy to find.  But they have some  great stories  talking about their  sex addiction  over the years  up to where they are now.  Some have overcome it.  Some haven't.  Who did?  Who didn't?  But they've got  some great stories  for the long road  that they have traveled.  Sex addiction stories  here on the  Opie and Anthony show.  This is the worst  of the Opie and Anthony show 
[03:00:00]  on SiriusXM.  I want to talk about sex.  Let's talk about that  sex thing.  Which sex thing?  Jimmy's little problem.  Yeah, because that's  a fucked up thing.  I mean, we got people  in the room that are married  and then we have some people  that are getting married  and then we have somebody  who's probably never  going to be married  who gets to fuck  his life away  if he chooses to.  I'll be getting married  someday.  No, you're not, Jimmy.  That's got to be  the worst addiction  though, man.  A sex addiction.  Because you've got to  have it.  Because you've got to  have the sex. 
[03:00:30]  How do you fucking  cure that?  You just got to  you have to stop  doing certain  unhealthy things  like fucking  the masturbation.  But then how do you  get to the point  that you're having  healthy sex?  Yeah, but it's also  a disconnection.  You're disconnected  from something.  Is there a cure  for sex addiction?  I really don't know.  Do people get through it?  Well, it's like  food addictions.  I mean, you do it  but you just do it  healthy.  That's all.  And you just know  when something's healthy  when you're having  healthy sex  it's okay.  You just know it.  And the difference  is if I'm jerking off  online and my dick's 
[03:01:00]  not even hard  and I'm coming  for the third time  of the day  You're at the wrong  website.  It must be the  comfortable chairs  in here.  I know.  Pazfield's a lot  more comfortable  over here.  Yeah, but you know  what's weird is that  there's guys that  meet girls  they like them  and you talk to them  how's your sex life?  Oh yeah, we fuck  like once a day  or at least four times  a week  and I'm like  you fuck the same  it's like wow  and you got  you like her  and it turns you on 
[03:01:30]  like I told my girl  I'm sorry  but you don't  it's like honey  she gets mad  because she wants  to come out  in lingerie  and be sexy  and she wants  my dick to get hard  it's like  you have to  if you want my dick  hard and you want  to fuck  you have to come over  and grab my dick  and fuck with it  it doesn't just  stand up on fucking  end like a fucking  new 18 year old  in fucking Cleveland  you know what I mean  it's  you need to come over  and it's like an old  dog  you rub its belly  and fucking jerk it  off a little bit  and I'll get hard  and we'll be able 
[03:02:00]  to fuck  but  and these guys  who fuck  I know friends of mine  who have girlfriends  and fuck them  and it's like  wow  but all the time  like  but they're really  into fucking  their chick  and it's like  there's something  about sex  that is fucked up  to me  why aren't you  into fucking  your chick  it's not that  I'm not into  fucking my chick  it's that  I'm disconnected  sex is a bad thing  sex was  I was taught  sex  in a fucked up way  so it represents  bad to me  so if I'm with 
[03:02:30]  somebody that I  give a shit about  I don't want to  do bad shit  to that person  exactly  I don't want to  do shit  bad shit to her  I want to do  I don't mind  doing bad shit  to some chick  I meet in New Brunswick  that you know  fuck her  I don't give a shit  like some  some chick  that just wants  to suck my cock  fantastic  my dick just goes  wah  I can't even  fucking not  have a hard on  around her  but somebody  you give a shit  about it's like  it's like fuck  this is bad  this is fucking bad  how the fuck  do you get over that  I don't know  you gotta  retrain yourself  you have to go back  and find out 
[03:03:00]  those things  that happened  that made it  exactly  that made it bad  but you also  stop back  acting out  like  like if you  stop acting out  like my dick  has been all over  the place lately  because I'm not  I mean occasionally  I am  jerking off  but not nearly  like what I was  I would literally  go home after the show  I would try to nap  and I couldn't nap  because I would  jerk off  and I wouldn't  stop jerking off  until it was  fucking  like I would  force myself  to go to the gym  and then  fucking  and then  work out  and go do my spot  and then  you know  jerk off again 
[03:03:30]  at night  it was awful  dude  don't you  it was awful  I jerk  in hotels  on the road  I have to  jerk off  every day  but it doesn't  take  you know  it's different  if you're jerking  off healthy  like if you just  scrap a load  you throw some  lube on your dick  and you're fucking  pumping out all  of yourself  and take a nap  that's fine  but if you're  on Craigslist  for three hours  pumping down  shemales  not that I do that  no me neither  but I mean  you know  and you get  pre-cum  coming out  for the whole  three hours  it's called edging  and then as soon  as you find one  you just shoot it  and it comes out 
[03:04:00]  and you feel nothing  why don't you  just jerk it off  really fast  and maybe you can  move on with  other activities  for that day  believe me  right now  that was Jim Norton  in the mirror  a thousand times  I would love to know  why I don't  but what is that about  it's escape  it's numbing feelings  my therapist told me  it's to numb your feelings  when you jerk off  in the mirror  that's a sign  of split personality  shut the fuck up  it is a sign  of split personality  if you jerk off  in the fucking mirror  that's creepy  maybe you just like  looking at yourself  jerking off  listen to me 
[03:04:30]  I'm not a fucking doctor  but I know  really  you're not  Dr. Gloss  really  wow  it is something  you're not even  a fucking high school student  you're barely you  it is something  about  you don't feel  and it sounds gay  but you have to  learn how to feel  something  it's actually  because you don't want to  because you grow up  with so much fucking pain  with whatever's happening  that you learn how to  do things  that make you  not feel pain 
[03:05:00]  I've jacked  out of fucking  websites  and shit like that  and you know  spent a long time  doing it  you know  you wait  you get right to the brink  and stop  because it fucking  feels good  there's no deep  dark fucking  secret there  for some people  it is  that's what  these guys are getting at  that's what I'm saying  like a guy like you  is a fucking  amazing to me  because you're  connected in a  fucking different way  you can  you can jack off  and then go  fucking pay your bills  and fucking do shit  yeah but also 
[03:05:30]  and then he can go  drink and buy guns  so you have the same thing  but you have  you fan it out  okay  I don't drink anymore  I don't do drugs anymore  I did quit smoking  my eating is not bad  so it all  fucking comes out  to my hand  my nipples  and my dick  all of it  all of that self-hatred  all that big thing  just dumps out that way  dumps out your cock  yeah all that need to escape  comes out your dick hole  if I could fucking  if I was eating cake  till fucking 3 in the morning  or drinking again  it wouldn't be as bad  then you'd be Bobby Kelly  that was just really gotcha 
[03:06:00]  well you know what  no honest to god though  I mean  food is just like sex  because you're on the fucking road  and you don't want to  you don't want to get a whore  you don't want to fucking  go to massage parlor  you don't want to let some chick  with fucking warts  come into your fucking room  and dry fucking boner  so you're like  fuck it  you get a pizza  and it actually  you disconnect  it's gratification  it's that quick fix  it's the same with comedy  it's not feeling  you don't want to feel  it's not that you don't want to feel  you want to feel  you want to feel quickly  and you want to rush 
[03:06:30]  no it's that you don't want to feel anything  I was laughing at the boss finger pretzels  don't bite your finger  get it  they're real small  he just has mustard  on his fingernail  yeah  I uh  Jimmy what are you doing  we're having a serious discussion  about your problems  it's gonna make a hand  it's gonna make Voss's hand  out of the pretzels  here's the thing  fucking visual jokes  on the radio  here's the thing 
[03:07:00]  you got five little pretzels  what I'm saying about my  he just did a chin joke  he lost his hand  yes of course  very funny Jimmy  so Jimmy you'd like  where's this gonna go  I don't know  I hope that I can stay away from it  let me swallow my pretzel  because  it's fucking making my life miserable  is it  awful  it looks like it's making it miserable though  not doing it  no  no  can't you change your  your practices  well yeah  like Ope said 
[03:07:30]  you know  just jack off  and shoot  and then go about your business  but yeah  but I wasn't even jerking off  when I was horny  I was just jerking off  because  it was something  that's the thing  if you're horny  and you're like  fuck me  I want to scrap a load  that's healthy  you don't need to scrap a load  no one cares  I'm not saying I wouldn't do that  but I don't know how to do that  like what I do  is I wind up on Craigslist  just looking at ads  or I wind up on one of eight websites  and it's fucking hours  and it's fucking endless  well like Ope said  just fucking jack off  yeah but it sounds like 
[03:08:00]  it doesn't work  it sounds like there's like  an OCD thing  happening there too  I know what you mean  but no  just because it's like  there's a tick  it is about escape  and Bobby's right  it is about feeling nothing  and numbing yourself  and it is a quick fix  in the sense that  you're getting a rush  it's that endorphin release  it's like a drug  let's be honest  when a guy comes  there's a major disappointment  right after you come  it's like you go from  a really cool high  to poof  let me tell you something  you're just crashing hard  you gotta help them  with our homework  jerking off  jerking off 
[03:08:30]  is like a big hug  it's like a hug  from the dad  you never had  it's just God  a fucking lonely hug  of spoons  well it was the same  as when you used to  like women jump up  and start doing chores  and they're like  just happy after  and stuff  and guys there  there's a massive crash  that happens  but we're brought up  on sex  and have fucked up  we're brought up  with porn  and magazines  and fuck fuck  fuck this bitch  I fucked that bitch  women are brought up  the whole  the opposite spectrum  it's like  find somebody you love 
[03:09:00]  and fucking romance  and blah blah blah  and you don't want to fuck  we're brought up  fuck that bitch  you fucked that bitch  I fucked that  I mean  so we're brought up  in a fucked up way  it's just  and it sucks for us  because you never  that's because  there had to be  a balance made  or else nothing  would get done  in this world  we'd all just be fucking  or if it was  the other way around  human beings  wouldn't exist  yeah but then  there's a point  there's a point  in life 
[03:09:30]  that when you meet  a chick you like  and all of a sudden  you're supposed to be  you're supposed to be  like them  you're supposed to  hey let's make love  you know  fuck what  what  let's say hi to  Wendy the trucker  she's a sex addict  I think we should  take some sex addict  I'd love to  sex addict  calls today  yes Wendy  Wendy  hi  hey  I just wanted to  say that I totally  understand how  Jimmy feels  I'm a sex addict  and I've gone to  therapy  Wendy can I stop you  for a second  I gotta be honest 
[03:10:00]  I'm not even trying  to be radio dick guy  you know  when a girl says  she's a sex addict  it's kinda hot  I don't mean to be  a dick but  what kind of  how did you act out  it's more like  the hunt  I kind of like  married men  are a lot easier  to get  but it's just  the thrill  of the hunt  once you get  them and have  sex then you  don't want  them anymore  huh so  how many  guys you're  fucking  huh  how many guys  were you 
[03:10:30]  fucking  um  it's probably  in the hundreds  wow  how many  I've been married  and it's been  hard being married  because sex  gets really boring  when you're with  that person  once you have  them  I have to  masturbate  like every night  before I go to bed  a couple times  sometimes  were you still  married  no  what's the most  guys you've had  in like a weekend  in a weekend  yeah  um  probably like  four  four or five  four guys in one

[03:27:30]  and the sex thing  and that's why I asked you  kiss when you make love  that's all  it wasn't a personal thing  yeah it is  you were talking about my wife  and kissing  because you talked about  how do you go from you  sucking a cock  you just said  well if I want my wife  to get me hard  she just can't come in  with a negligee  she's got to pull my cock  I was asking you  a normal question  about kissing  and you're talking about  fucking hand jobs  he shot an elastic  at Norm's ass 
[03:28:00]  and it caught it  it just disappeared  in Norm's ass  a baby hand  shot out  bossy kiss Bonnie  when you're having sex  not that much  that's what I'm saying  kiss the body  huh  why  because it's just  kissing is  it shows so much affection  you kiss like when your girlfriend  are you like  will you  you make eye contact  and kiss  yes  I don't do that  what's wrong with that  I don't do that  see you're  exactly  you're one of those guys  yeah  you're one of those guys  oh look at this  he's like a little romantic  who kisses  no one kisses 
[03:28:30]  yeah but I'll kiss somebody  but not a girlfriend  like I'll kiss in that situation  but not with a girlfriend  you weren't kissing your girlfriend  you don't kiss hookers  sometimes  no not with  having sex  oh no she didn't want to kiss me either  she would close her eyes  and pretend I was anyone but me  what would you do if you were fucking me  Bonnie  Rich  you and Bonnie  when did you stop kissing her  what's that  Anthony what happened  what are you doing over there  what happened  Jimmy's fart  smells so fucking bad  I don't smell it 
[03:29:00]  dude it didn't hit you  it's pure shit  it's fucking  it's evil  it is evil incarnate  it's like shit  it's coming out  we didn't know what you were doing  we thought you were going to a bad place  or something  I was going to a bad place  stinkville  alright Rich  when did you stop kissing Bonnie  I mean I kissed her once in a blue  when you were first dating  I'm sure you were kissing like crazy  right  yeah I used to kiss her  I think the kissing slows down a little bit  yeah I think the kissing does 
[03:29:30]  because like well  you know  I mean  it's not  so when you're having sex  you don't kiss her  don't look her in the eye  what's going on  no  well something  no not in the eye  I try to  because I  no  back of the neck  I just put my head to the side  and you know  and grunt  and just think about  whatever I can to keep it hard  wait do you say I love you  while you're having sex  will you say like I love you baby  yeah  really  maybe not every time  but you're looking right at her  when you say it  and she's looking back  why are you making me look like I'm a  no you're normal  but that's fucking a creep 
[03:30:00]  but see you're not supposed to have  you're supposed to have a fucked up  background too  you shouldn't be able to do all that good stuff  my background isn't fucked up sex wise  my background's fucked up with like a mom  and other things  yeah but that's what distorts your sexual fucking  yeah but you guys have like fucked up sex backgrounds  but what's going to happen with you  what's going to happen someday  I mean aren't you worried that someday  she's going to want a  she's going to want a little  you know  she's not going to want  you know  I love you  I love you too  she's going to want you fucking little pussy  get the fuck over here  not to like 
[03:30:30]  get too personal  but it's not all  you know  it's a variety  we talk about this  relationships need lust and love  you got to understand  that whole lust thing  has to be part of your relationship  I can't picture you talking dirty  do you get mean  do you get like too mean  no I don't get mean  you like that  you fucking idiot  that's Anthony  you just get way too mean  you like that  you fucking moron  fucking Jew lover  you fucking  you dirty fucking kike 
[03:31:00]  holy shit  you fucking like that  you like that  yeah  liberal  you'd be surprised  can I ever tell you  how much I hate your cunt mother  you'd be surprised  I'm very romantic  are you really  I'm a romantic  what do you say  like I love you baby  that feels so good  oh that feels so good baby  that feels so good  that feels so good  yeah I kind of give like a  play by play maybe  a little bit  oh yeah that's it  put it in your mouth  that's right  put it in your mouth  like it's a fucking  Smith and Wesson  take your bullets  all over your chin  you're chipping her teeth 
[03:31:30]  with your desert eagle  but he has to hand out  name tags  just to make sure  he's  keeps it all  organized  do you ever fantasize  watching your wife  thank somebody else  oh yeah  I like you a lot  look down at her name tag  do you actually  Anthony has a registration  booth  in his front  fucking lobby  Jesus  please sign in  please  stop at the help desk  and then come back  to the millionaire's cock  take your laminates 
[03:32:00]  Anthony's very private  and holds his cards  very close to his chest  but this is what  we're imagining  that there's  registration processing  so Woss asked a good question  Woss asked a sick question  I heard it  what Woss  do you fantasize  like your wife or girlfriend  banging somebody else  see I'm not  I can't go down that road  why would you fantasize  that one bothers me  why  it's so wrong  I never told my chick that  of course  but while her eyes were closed  just whatever the hell  she was going  I was just pretending  that I was watching  there was like five guys  teaching her a lesson  actually I actually 
[03:32:30]  I keep my eyes shut  because I don't want to see  the guy's balls and assholes  that she's blowing  while I'm fucking  well I had this one girl  and I fucked it up  I can't believe I fucked this up  I didn't even get to fuck her  she blew me a couple times  she goes my fantasy  is three guys  in every orifice  you know  wait three guys  that's nine guys  no I mean you know  one in each  nine guys  alright  he's the smartest  because he can multiply 
[03:33:00]  you know what I'm saying  and I fucked it up with her  but you gotta be  see it's gotta be like  a real someone  you're close with  it can't be just  some girl you're fucking  it's gotta be  someone you're connected with  I used to  I fucked up  a lot of relationships  when I was younger  because my thing was  and it was a fucked up  I used to do it  to test the chick  because I don't trust women  I fucking hate  I hate women  so I used to get them  I used to get them  like them  and then if I really like them  I'd try to get them  to blow my friends  I know that's fucked up 
[03:33:30]  holy fuck  and I would  you know what  95% of them  would blow my friends  and then I'd be like  I would be like  okay  I knew it  she's a fucking whore  fuck you  but how would  but then  hold on hold on  you're jumping way ahead  like how would you get  her to blow your friends  I'll tell you  you start fucking her  and then you start fantasizing  and you're joking around  you see where they're at  and then you start making her  tell you  if she could 
[03:34:00]  would she  and they're usually like  no no  and then you get them  to finally admit  like yeah I would  and then they start getting into it  because they think it gets you off  so they'll stop being like  yeah I'd fucking suck  you like that  yeah  and then all of a sudden  one night she shows up  and your friend is  hey what's going on  I just stopped by  at 2 in the morning  how you guys doing  and then you know  she  you leave him alone  for a second  and then  and then you leave him alone  and then she'll start  you know  do you let your friend in on this  oh yeah absolutely  you tell him  you tell him  look this is the deal  one time I did it 
[03:34:30]  I said you come over  I'm going to leave you alone  you start talking  I'm going to come back in  we're going to go in the other room  I'm going to get her to stop blowing me  then you walk in  while she's blowing me  and she's going to keep blowing me  and just take your cock out  don't fucking  don't panic  just take your cock out  and that's it  come over  and take your cock out  and then  they come on  take their cock out  and she  I'm telling you  it turns me on right now  once you're  the chick you're dating  and all of a sudden  she looks over 
[03:35:00]  and sees another cock  and then she just goes for it  you're like  oh god  oobly  oobly  but you're going out  with this girl  kind of  not in love  but you're going out with her  and then all of a sudden  she blows him  and then  you know  it's kind of fucked up  see but in fantasy  the problem  because then you show up  like hostage  negotiations  with his potential girl  it backfired on me  it backfired on me  I mean there's one girl  that I really like  hot chick  and I  I tried to get her to do it  and she kind of 
[03:35:30]  she was kind of  fantasizing  this is so fucked up  my friend was in the other room  and I opened the door  to my room  and was fucking her  doggy style  halfway out the door  you know what I mean  and then she just was like  you know I was like  yeah you fucking suck it  what if he came right now  what if he walked in here  would you grab his car  and she was like  stop stop  this is bullshit  she started crying  and then she left  oh god what a bad scene  yeah she dumped me too  did you end up blowing him  because he wanted a blowjob  I know I should have  see the problem is 
[03:36:00]  the worst part is  I was actually at the time  living with six  I was living with six retarded men  I was their counselor  yeah I've heard these stories  I'm banging a chick in the hallway  don't repeat the story  because some guy's going to  call up and say  big fucking retarded mule  comes out  the problem is  sucking on it  see because you came  it's drooling already  not him you idiot  he has his fingers  you can't use friends  you gotta use fake people  in those fantasies  he takes his wig off  and puts it on her head  oh my god  hold it for me 
[03:36:30]  she wants a baseball sign  because she faces Pete Rose  you didn't tell me  you knew Pete Rose  boss what do you have  no I'm just  it's  you can't use your real friends  in a fantasy like that  it's gotta be a  complete unknown  what are you out of your mind  why don't you use your friends  how come his head and his neck  just have like one line  there's no face shape 
[03:37:00]  there's no lower face  holy shit  it goes  that stupid puzzled look  she's sucking his dick  that dumb fucking look on his face  his hand starts opening close  why does Pete Rose look a little scared  why is only one of his eyes opening  why is Pete Rose's tongue so long  oh fuck  mommy 
[03:37:30]  Pete Rose is shitting on the floor  it constantly spirals out of control  it's fucking too funny  Pete Rose did not touch my head  he has jelly on his fingers  going back to Bobby's story  oh god  Sean brings up something  that comes up a lot  Bobby

[03:38:30]  this is something that comes up a lot  a guy's never blow me  but if a guy blew me  it wouldn't make me gay  it makes him gay  okay  alright  no but I'm not saying  dude  I'm not saying you have to  fucking suck a cock  no I didn't say I suck a cock  I'm saying  a pussy needs to be in the room  okay  okay  so if there's a pussy in the room  and some guy blows you  no your dick needs to be  in her mouth  or a pussy  I mean you can't just have  two cocks out  and no pussy in the room  yeah it's done it a million times  me and my friends  have doubled  so many fucking broads 
[03:39:00]  Bobby  and you should be having fun  Bobby  why is  why is Pete Rose  wearing a hat with a propeller  I'm gonna shit myself  I'm fucking laughing so hard  I can't look at Jimmy  I can't fucking look at him  I hate that fucking guy's  Pete Rose  holy shit  god damn I'm crying  what gets you more  if you're looking at  what gets you more  more excited  if you look at  two girls 
[03:39:30]  if you're ready to jerk off  say you were looking at porn  two girls eating pussy  or a girl blowing a guy  I like both  what  that's not the question  I don't  there's no  there's no  what gets you more  excited  yeah  oh yeah  what do you  yeah  I like  I like  I like Pete Rose  sucking on a lollipop  while he's getting head  oh these guys  are fucking  oh shit  I can't take it  holy fuck  he's gonna  fuck 
[03:40:00]  retard joke  there's like  three shows  going on  at one time  it's fucking  hilarious  I'm sorry  I couldn't look at  Jimmy  because he's laughing  so fucking hard  about Pete Rose  that I start  cracking up  I'm crying  I'm fucking  tears  coming out of my  eyes from that  fucking Jimmy man  oh  funny  alright this guy's  gonna back you up  this does come up  a lot though  let's say hi to  Will and Charlotte  Will 
[03:40:30]  yeah  hey  hey  it's hard  to hear you  so uh  listen  I'm  all these guys  saying it's gay  if there's another  room  another guy in the room  uh  they're just basically  not confident  with themselves  I got a friend of mine  him and his wife  hang out with me  and my chick  they get it on  you know  we're fucking  right next to each other  it's not a big deal  it's nothing  you just  you know  it's all about  being confident  with yourself  these guys are uh  they get a little  timid of the penis  do you  does your wife 
[03:41:00]  and uh  does his wife  and your girl  fool around  oh yeah  exactly  yeah definitely  you know  we live in the shower  you know  all that stuff  and uh  you know  you go back and forth  whatever  but it's not gay  just cause there's  another penis  in the room  do you bang  his wife  like he bangs  your girlfriend  nah  neither one of the  chicks are cool  with that  it's not a full swap  oh  what would you  rather look at  I will say  the first time  it ever happened  two girls  I was fucking  my chick  and he was  fucking his wife  and his hairy leg  rubbed on mine 
[03:41:30]  and I lost everything  I don't know  what I'd rather watch  though because  two chicks is almost  too mild to me  like I've seen that  so many times  there's something  dirtier about a chick  blowing a guy  like to me  that's more of a sex  it's so acceptable  and I'm not saying  two chicks doesn't  turn me on  it does  but it's almost like  that turned me on  when I was 20  I'm not talking  about porno  either  I don't either  lesbian porno  it don't turn me on  as much as watching  I'm not even talking  porno  I'm talking like  you're at a party  let's say  and there's a bedroom  and there's two chicks 
[03:42:00]  in bed  on the bed  and you're fucking  just watching  that's hot  or a guy  fucking  a chick  in a bed  at a party  or something  what would you rather  like peep in on  really hard to say  it depends  it's like you know  I'd much rather see  and it's not a homophobic thing  but I'd rather see  the two girls  going at it  I might too  at times  I've seen  we saw a live sex show  in Brazil  and it didn't  fucking turn me on  as much

[03:45:30]  I don't know  we were like 16 or 17  I don't fucking know  that's a little old  yeah  really  yeah  it's not experimenting  anymore  the only time  me and Voss  jerked off one time  but it was  there was a girl  in between us  and then she got up  for a second  and I'm laying on the bed  and there's like a girl  space in between us  then she came back  and Voss was so funny  that day  because  I think I told this story  but he goes  he goes  let's up the coin  whoever loses  has to fuck her  and you said this  in front of us  that's the beauty of that  he came first  of course  and there was cat shit 
[03:46:00]  in the bathroom  and he must have smelled it  when he walked in  I'm trying to jerk off  and I hear  wait wait  me and  also  this is what I was hoping  we were going to get to  by the way  the Rich Voss  Jim Norton  sex stories  but the one time  we got tons of them  the one time  I was fucking  this hot girl  I met her outside the cellar  she was like 20  and I'm  and I'm  we're going  Norton's driving us  back to 
[03:46:30]  wherever  my car  and she's blowing me  in the back of the car  and he's  all I can see is his beady eyes  in the mirror  right  so we go back to his house  right  and she's  and  she don't really  no one ever wants anything  to do with him  when they're with me  you know what I mean  so  he was like  she's blowing me  and he's like  touching her  he jacked off  right  and I swear to god  his load  hit himself in the face  I'm sitting next to him  and he's laying on the couch  and 
[03:47:00]  and  and then we made her sign  something like  did you have a good time  remember  we go  oh my god  do you remember the time  I almost made the girl puke  with my asshole  I also remember that  would you take your shirt off  hold on  why are you asking Jimmy  if he remembers that  we were together  we got this chick  a long time ago  and we went back  to his place  and  and we  he already did his thing  so I got her  and I  I made her eat  I made her want to eat my ass  and blow me  so but I 
[03:47:30]  he was in the other room  I was in a hallway  so I just took my pants off  and I still had my dirty  hot socks on  cause we just did like  three shows  so I was just  my balls were all hot  sweaty and all  and she  she was lying on the floor  and  and then she got up  on her  I don't know  she had her fucking  on her bum  and just started  eating my ass out  and this is  all Jimmy heard  from the other room  was  wait wait wait  it went  oh god  oh god 
[03:48:00]  it was in the hallway  of my apartment  with the sunflower seeds  up your ass  remember the  like a fucking picture  I had dust bunnies  in my asshole  remember the four  and the two  I brought back  to the hotel room  oh the one was  getting married  with the bad teeth  the four and the two  yeah yeah yeah  one was a four  and then one was  so fucking horrendous  and Jimmy  he's begging her  one made her a two  that she had all  her female parts  it was  these were the  ugliest  I met him at  Caroline's  she had a blouse on  from Marshall's 
[03:48:30]  and it was  fucking horrific  and I called Norton  he was doing  Dangerfields  and I was at Caroline's  I got these two broads  and we go back  to this fucking  they have a hotel room  at the fucking Marriott  and this girl's  blowing me in the bathroom  and he's begging the two  telling the two  that he just got  out of rehab  or whatever  was I?  yeah yeah  he would get lying  I was in rehab  I haven't been  with a girl  in a long time  and she just  no  you're working a four  that's awesome  and then the four  the four blew me  was eating my ass  out and stuff  and I talked her  into blowing Jimmy 
[03:49:00]  right  and then we're leaving  and I go  she blew you  he goes yeah  I go did you make  out with her  he goes just a little  I go well she just  ate my ass  I was making out  with her in the bathroom  and I didn't know  she had eaten his ass  oh fuck  it would have been better  if you didn't give away  the ass eating  in the setup  yeah  you should have said  she blew you  oh shit  that's better  that's alright  it's still  I just caught that  it still leaves a bad  taste in your mouth  I try to get away 
[03:49:30]  we were on the road  didn't I like  fucking try to get  a waitress  to go in a closet  with you  yeah  just look at his cock  just look at his cock  he's got a big dick  just look at his dick  he's trying to get a waitress  to go in a closet  I used to brag about his dick  to other girls  try to get them  in the fucking bathroom  with me  oh god  I think that's why  like I'm friends  with all you guys  but I never have  taken that last step  to be close friends  with you guys  because I've seen enough  I've seen Jimmy's cock  you can't be a friend  of Jimmy's until  you've seen his cock  I've watched Vos  make out with a grandmother  me and Bobby 
[03:50:00]  don't really have  you know  we're still getting  to know each other  but just when it comes  time to make that  final like step  to be close friends  yeah  we're driving through  Times Square  to drop around  in a poor authority  so she can take  a 12 hour bus  back home  yeah she had to go  to Cleveland  she was sexy  and she was blowing me  and he's in the backseat  peaking  oh shit  wonderful  oh man  you know what  I had no problem  you saying that  I was peaking  alright  I have no problem  with that  but what  really happened  was  you got my attention  and then you're  taking the rear view mirror 
[03:50:30]  and fucking  making the angle  perfect for me  of course  helping a friend out  that fucking Latin broad  I don't want to say  her name  that I was going out with  was so fucking hot  man  I jerked off one time  and I had just  come into the city  after I jerked off  and the chick you see  was sucking his dick  in the car  so I sat in the backseat  and my dick was  like a fucking root  I'm just trying to jerk off  and she was grabbing it too  really  she was  yeah I think so  I hope so  maybe she was just watching  I don't remember  she was watching  what the fuck  is with these guys  she was so fucking hot 
[03:51:00]  Jesus Christ  will you stop pretending  I'm not here  you just threw trash at me  I want to hear  so into your stupid story  you just yeah  I'm throwing trash  it's hitting Bobby in the head  what's wrong with you  you fucking creep  he thought he was at SeaWorld  hey uh  we're getting  you know what  it's pretty fucking funny  that was pretty good  you know it's been a while  Joe in Vegas  is requesting the  famous Central Park story  can I tell it from the beginning  real quick  no you don't have to be quick  this is a great story  there's a lot of new listeners  that haven't heard this one yet 
[03:51:30]  this is one of their classics  we were coming out of somewhere  and this hot  I mean it's Black Chick  you were walking by  SOB's on Houston  yeah  what's SOB's  this is the club  not that it matters  okay  this Black Chick  and she was like a nine  right  and we said  and I came up to me  and goes  oh I  she knew me from comedy  like B tier  one of those shows  Boston Comedy Club  that's just like  a big TV show  well no  whatever  I don't know  she knew me from a TV show  whatever  Death Jam  it was either Death Jam  or a local comedy club 
[03:52:00]  I'm not sure  how she recognized you  that doesn't matter  okay  I'm sorry  I'm very recognizable  you're right  you're right  Jesus Christ  I'm admitting fault  you're right  go ahead  so she was  we go  you want to hang out  we went and got bagels  and then we go  we were planning to go  to the pee booths  already  but we were hungry  maybe we weren't even  going to go get bagels  but we couldn't say  you want to go straight  to the pee booths  we go  let's go eat  no we went to a bagel place  that was right by the booth  the booth was on 54th  right up Broadway  so we went to that bagel place 
[03:52:30]  right there  so we could just segue  oh let's go to the booth  we're right here  put fucking bagels  on your cocks  and then fucking blew each other  and ate bagels  at the same time  but wait  so then we went  we went to the pee booth  you guys went to the pee booth  together?  not in the  not in the same booth  well I brought her  into the booth with me  and they kicked me out  the Indian guys go  you know  they kicked us out of the booth  they do  and then we're standing  on Broadway  right across from the Letterman  the Letterman's  Ed Sullivan Theater  God could you tell the story 
[03:53:00]  will you calm down  I'm sorry  yeah you are  so I'm making out with her  and I got my hand  under her dress  she has like one of these  slip dresses that you know  you tie  and I'm fingering her  right on Broadway  great description of a dress  I'm fingering her  and as I'm fingering her  Norton's standing behind her  just squeezing her butt  like who's nice  with that Norton face  when he gets dirty  so I fingered her  and she came  she came right on Broadway  so then we get in the car  and we drive her out  and we go up to Central Park 
[03:53:30]  right  Norton looks  he has false teeth  when he's getting  really turned on  he just sucks his top lip in  his top lip goes in  he crinkles his nose  yeah his nose comes over  his upper lip  and then his eyes squint  and he gets that little  angry brow  I'm gonna fucking kill somebody  wait did I  did I squat behind her too  I think I squatted behind her  on the fucking  on Broadway  yeah on Broadway  you're squatting on your knees  grabbing her  this is 1968  what  who the fuck does that now  how could you even  get away with that  it was between  a newspaper stand 
[03:54:00]  and a car  yeah  it was dark really  oh well  and he's  go ahead  you can tell the rest  oh god  so then we drive around  and we go up to Central Park  and we park on the east side  and there's a little wall there  mhm  and we climb over the wall  and  and we go down  into like the fucking woods  of Central Park  and she is fucking hot  and then she starts  blowing me  right  she's on  she's on  she's blowing me  what is this fucking cruising  with Al Pacino  she's blowing me 
[03:54:30]  and then I look down  wait she was standing  and blowing you  she bent over  no bent over  bent over  you know like that  forgot to tell  she was a midget  and then uh  when she was young  I was the only midget  in this story  and then she bent over  blowing me  and I look down  and Norton  is eating her ass  like it's candy  I see his face  eating her  you know  I wasn't really into  and then I look  and I go  he's just eating  this strange girl's ass  right 
[03:55:00]  right in there  right  I mean  a girl  we picked up  walking down the street  okay  and he's got his face  in there  like candy  and it's buried  in there  right  his little tongue  coming on  how was it  huh  how was it  it was nice  nice dumper  did she have any roids  no I don't remember  it was dark  was it  was her ass  no that was her ass  you went in there  like without any visual  assessment of the target  not knowing what's 
[03:55:30]  around that corner  did you feel any wrinkles  with your tongue  no she was young  this girl was fucking smoking  I don't know if she blew  did she blow you after  yeah but my dick  was kind of half in and out  so I had to jerk off  and she was like  to lick my balls  or something  she hated it  she didn't want any part of me  she was just doing it for him  and I ate her ass  so she probably felt  somewhat obligated  it's like when you let a salesman  in the house  she was like  I'm gonna get something  alright  I'm gonna buy something  what's the cheapest thing  you got for sale  yeah shit  fuck shit  so then we're driving home  right  he just ate her ass 
[03:56:00]  and I go  I said to him  I go  did you have a good time  he goes yeah  it was kind of fun  but I was a little uncomfortable  because I don't want to get  my pants dirty  kneeling down  I go  but you'll eat a strange girl's ass  and you're worried about  grass stains  grass stains on the knees  of your pants  and you just rush over things  he tells the story badly  he gives it away  not that it's a big secret  but it was like  the way it happened  from what I remember  I'm like yeah  my legs are really sore  you're like wow  I'm like I was squatting down  I didn't want to kneel on the grass  and get my pants dirty  you just rush right to it 
[03:56:30]  so he's eating her ass  you reiterated that  like we got it  okay but here's the thing  I explained it perfectly  you were on the ground  you don't want to get your pants dirty  I just want to apologize  for my fucking slow  drawn out Guatemalan story now  because now I know  what it feels like  to you guys  I just feel like shit  you know when  something happens to you  and you're like  oh fuck I feel bad  you know what  the radio hosts  get very uncomfortable  when those stories  are going slow  I feel like  I like the story  I know  so why is he apologizing 
[03:57:00]  for our story  I don't know  because you weren't involved in it  sorry  because he was making  we're not an improv team  asshole  I know  you don't care  you're on your own improv team  okay  you're one letter  short of fucking improv  improve  nothing  no that would be improv  you're one letter  short of improv  you're improv  you're a improv  that stunk on so many  different fucking levels  yeah  it stinks  so when you got home  and you were living  with your mom at the time  he gets so mad 
[03:57:30]  who  why are you getting mad  I'm talking to him now  I'm asking about  the Central Park  when you got home  because you were living  with your mom  and she did your laundry  and saw grass stains  and she say  were you eating ass again  no I didn't  see that's the whole thing  he never got the grass stains  that's right  so why would that  that's a funny joke  if we pretend  he had grass stains  yeah  we already  pretend  suspend  this little suspend  we already acknowledged  that he didn't have  this isn't the fucking  Carol Burnett show  who's Carol Burnett  who's that  is that Carol Burnett 
[03:58:00]  Carol Burnett  is that Carol Burnett  what  you said  is that her what  what  is that her what  what  you said  is that her what  I'm waiting to hear  your joke  come on  I don't have one  I'll then fucking  shit your face  is that it  for the sex stories  you want to share  one more  I don't know  if we have any more  you don't have  any sex stories  with your friends  where you fucked  a bunch of chicks  with other guys  I swear to god  what about you  Anthony  nothing  you just  you and your brother  never fucking

[04:07:30]  that was  oh no  no way  oh my god  Jimmy  is this the  that's it  is this the  what I got  it's the same thing  Jimmy is wearing  MC Hammer pants  that's  I'll tell you what that is  1990  there was a comedy  a contest for Bud Light  and I think I was too  they only taped me for like  how long was it taped  two minutes  two minutes  they taped me for two and a half minutes  and just turned off the recorder  because I was too dirty  it was  what is with the pants 
[04:08:00]  I always wore those  MC Hammer pants  I thought they were cool  the big fucking  purple pants  and then you got a  a little Bud Light t-shirt on  look at what a skinny little  gent you were  very depressing  big head of hair  I  I can't get the audio up  oh  my  is it you or me  if it's me  fucking Mars is gonna get beating  that  it's  I think it's only one channel  I have no channels  you look  hysterical  it doesn't look like you  no 
[04:08:30]  it looks like somebody  you could be like  wow that looks like  a young guido jimmy  I know  a little jersey idiot  you are a jersey idiot  you gotta put this online  I'm going to  I'm having it done  wow  I haven't found a bunch of old shit  I'm gonna show a progression  of how awful I got  this  you wanna sync it up  oh it's terrible  I can't hear it over here  it's only  I can't hear it either  it's only  it's in one channel  cause it's  what happened  I would hold  I would never take the mic  out of the stand  but the jersey accent 
[04:09:00]  is really embarrassing  you wanna play this now  oh god  well I mean  I don't think anybody  will wait for it  nobody cares  it's with the pants  no they'll wait for it  do you think  yes  oh I wanna hear it  this is the type of stuff  you hold back  you could play it now  and play it again  you wanna sync it  you wanna sync it up Danny  I can't  does that start  when this starts  I don't know  I can't hear it  I'm in the same boat as you  I can't hear it  no I know  just start yours  at the same time  I think it's  it'll be close enough  just so we have a visual 
[04:09:30]  for us  not anybody else  as I prowl the stage  I just don't know  if you have the full clip  that's all  well that's why I asked Jimmy  is that the same clip  yeah  it is  it is  alright  just start at the same time  it'll be close enough  here's Jimmy from how long ago  this was  I was doing comedy  six months  and I had won  one leg of the competition  in New Jersey  in Rascal South  and this was the  Bud Light comedy competition  in Rascal's West Orange  so you just started  your comedy career  but what year  1990  so this is 20 years ago 
[04:10:00]  dude this is fucking  I wanna say October of 1990  my first time on stage  was April 1st  wow  and I was six months in  to comedy  I remember when I was doing it  no kidding  holy shit  I was doing Spuds Buckley  when you were doing this  yeah  it's a bad  but I wish I had continued  in this vein  because  I went into my high energy  thing after this  like I tried to be likable  this wasn't really  this was more aggressive  yeah  but then people were like  you gotta be likable  and that's when I went on  to that high energy thing  which is  with the wacky voice 
[04:10:30]  much more humiliating  than this  and you're putting on  some type of  heavier accents  very heavy New Yorkish  Jersey accent  it was just a performing thing  I don't know why I did that  I was trying to find myself  alright here we go  should have looked in the  douchebag emporium  that's where I would have been  Jim Norton from 20 years ago  a little taste  why did they call that  the hair club for men  every one of those  fuckers is bald  no clue whatsoever  mind if I talk about  sex for a minute  yeah  you mind  you lying sex 
[04:11:00]  and shit  you won't want to hear about it  but I'd like to talk  for one thing  Bud Light  is sponsoring this thing  as we all know  they make you wear this shirt  and I don't even drink  men in the audience  any men in this audience  ever try to have sex  when we're drunk  yeah  it's like trying to stuff  a marshmallow  into a coin slot  so fucking  you son of a bitch  and as soon as you leave  forget it  hard enough to cut glass  you cannot fucking win  and this microphone  is full  there we go  we got it  men in the  let's see how honest  we are tonight 
[04:11:30]  that's the line I hate  he's getting laughs though  I was  six months  he's getting laughs  with Otto's line  they're laughing at him  hair club for men  was Otto's  I have to keep saying that  I'm sorry Otto  it's just weird  it's  hair club for men  sounds like a completely  different person obviously  yeah  it really does  like more of an ass  that accent  is the fucking worst  Pat from Minaki  is calling you  Jimmy DiPaolo  I didn't know 
[04:12:00]  who Nick DiPaolo  was at that point  or did I  no  he was  Nick's a Boston guy  Jimmy's rocketing dignity  what are you talking about  we got it  there we go  this mic is  there we are  phone is full  there we go  we got it  men in the  let's see how honest  we are tonight  how many men  in this audience  masturbate  I love an honest group  come on men 
[04:12:30]  you're going to tell me  with a face like that  you don't masturbate  sir  there you go  you got hands  like the fucking  werewolf  I know you  masturbate  it's like you got  Willie Nelson  in a chokehold  I masturbated a lot  growing up as a kid  man  I got no shame in it  growing up  my sheets  looked like  cornflakes  I'm serious  man  my parents  used to bend up  my sheets  at the end of the week  and sell them  as wicker furniture  can I pause that  but I  that's still  two of the best  lines I've ever  written  yeah  my sheets 
[04:13:00]  look like  cornflakes  and wicker furniture  yes  I will take  those to the  grid  yeah  that's a good  line  it certainly  was  and I'll tell you  where that came  from  I used to jerk  off  and I would  wipe my own  cum off  with my sheet  move it over  a little  and fall asleep  I would wipe  cum off  on the sheets  I slept in  yeah  do you think  mom knew  grandma and I  were changing  the sheets  one time  she was helping me  and literally  there was a giant  stiff patch  and my grandmother  said to me  what happened here  and I was like 
[04:13:30]  I spilled Pepsi  Pepsi  is that what you call it  yes  it tastes like  cum  yeah  wow  well the line  is good  but it's delivered  like Ralph Macchio  there you go  hey  sounds like  we're listening  to a young comedian  out there  you know  it's hard  without the comedian  part  a young horse's ass  it's hard to  it's hard to connect  this to you  I know  it doesn't sound  like you 
[04:14:00]  your voice  is completely different  I don't know  when I blew it  I have tape  from 95  I went through  this really weird  time where in 93  I was like that  high energy  like where I should  have had my throat  cut  but then I started  coming to New York  and in 95  I just found a set  where fucking  Eddie Brill brings me  on a carillon  he didn't know my name  he's like  when I was on my way  to Vail  to do a comedy  contest out there  and I'm like  I still have a little  bit of the high  energy voice  but I'm starting  to mellow  it's like you can  see it's a huge  difference from 93  yeah it's kind of  cool to see 
[04:14:30]  like I wasn't  as big a douchebag  thank god for stage  time  this is  this is just  very interesting  yeah yeah  it's  there's a confidence  in you  six months in  it was just  pretend  I was terrified  really  I used to pray  for gigs  to get cancelled  really  oh god  your body language  is definitely  showing confidence  dude I like  myself more here  than I did  when I was  doing the  how we doing  you know  rubbing my head  that's why I thought  this would be  really bad  because we heard  the high energy  stuff that's  really uncomfortable 
[04:15:00]  to listen to  this isn't as  uncomfortable  no it's not  the voice is  very strange  the voice is  really odd  but this is just  the guy  six months in  in MC Hammer  pants  they're terrible  here we go  let's play  my parents used  to bend up  my sheets  at the end  of the week  and sell them  as wicker furniture  but I got  no shame  anybody  remember the  first time  they masturbated  not yet  come on sir  do you remember 
[04:15:30]  the first time  you masturbated  sure he's doing  it right now  I remember  the first time  I masturbated  I didn't know  how to do it  I was a dumb  kid growing up  so I asked  somebody  I had no pride  I said  how do you  masturbate  he says  dummy  it's like  shaking a  ketchup bottle  I said  okay I think  I could do that  so that night  I was trying  it and I was  having a great  time  and my mother  had to ruin  it for me  she screamed  at me  she said  what the hell  are you doing  to those french  fries  they kicked us  out of the 
[04:16:00]  restaurant  it was bad  news man  phone sex  is a new  thing  I tried  phone sex  I didn't  like that  I almost  got electrocuted  bad experience  man  it fell apart  a little bit  and you see  my hands  over my face  that's how  the  hold on  keep it right  there  that's how  the tape  ends  Sam cut it  just to be  radio conscientious  but the next  one was  I remember  I masturbated  and it was  I used to do  a joke  about jerking  off in church  and whoever  was saving 
[04:16:30]  it just  had enough  cut you  hey we  needed that  no no  that was  you can't hear it  that would be  hilarious to just  hear the tape  end  in the middle  of your set  wow  they just like  they just like  cut you off  yeah I mean  I  well because they knew  they weren't using it  because it was too dirty  so dirty  Bud Light can't have  fucking masturbation jokes  come on  Bud Light  maybe Bud Light  maybe for Bud Light  but not for Bud Weiser  it was for Fox  I think  or something  I would love to get 
[04:17:00]  the whole tape  but I think that  that literally  is all that exists  wow  yes  the voice is  beyond recognition  it's not you  I don't know  when my voice  changed  it changed  at one point  it might have been  when I was doing  1999  when me and  Louis Black  did that  fucking short  film together  where I screamed  through a lot of  pegs  you had to scream  yeah  well maybe it was  just doing  comedy every night  which film  Sidesplitters  love Sidesplitters  yeah that was  funny  how long ago  was that  1999  get the fuck
