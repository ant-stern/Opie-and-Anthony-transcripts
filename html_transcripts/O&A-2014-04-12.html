<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with commercials for tax lawyers and oil well investments, transitioning into a segment on the scrap metal industry.  A caller, Richie, detailed the booming business, fueled by Chinese demand and widespread scavenging.  The hosts then discussed videos showcasing the deadly consequences of copper wire theft, including electrocutions and even a murder at a scrapyard.  Callers contributed anecdotes about thefts from cell towers and irrigation systems.  This was followed by a critique of a poorly received Bruce Springsteen cover song, played on air.  The segment concluded with a heated debate surrounding the firing of the Mozilla CEO for his anti-gay marriage donation, touching upon free market principles, freedom of speech, and potential intimidation. Graphic descriptions and videos of electrocution injuries were featured.

Numerous commercial breaks followed, interspersed with a studio interview of Morgan Spurlock, promoting his CNN show, *Inside Man*.  The commercials included ads for testosterone boosters, debt relief, internet filtering software, pet supplements, office space, trucking services, language learning software, and payroll services.  Spurlock discussed episodes about paparazzi, the quest for immortality (stem cell harvesting, organ printing), UFOs, and college athlete compensation.  Funny moments arose from Spurlock's paparazzi mishaps, particularly misidentifying Ashley Tisdale. He detailed his experiences embedding with paparazzi, including encounters with Kim Kardashian, Ray Liotta, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Reese Witherspoon, discussing their methods, financial aspects, ethical concerns, and the potential for celebrity boycotts. A caller revealed Spurlock directed the One Direction documentary *This Is Us*, leading to a discussion of his documentary work. Another caller discussed the Phoenix Lights, shifting the conversation to extraterrestrial life and technological limitations in its detection. The show briefly touched on a controversial incident at Penn State before concluding.

The show resumed with a discussion of favorite documentaries, contrasting dark films like "Brothers Keeper" (incest and murder) with lighter fare like "Anvil! The Story of Anvil," "American Movie," "Heavy Metal Parking Lot," "Hands on a Hard Body," and "King of Kong."  Spurlock remained in studio. A caller, Robert, challenged a previous segmentâ€™s discussion on starving college athletes, citing resources at schools like Alabama, sparking a debate on college athletics, particularly in the SEC. The conversation shifted to the death of John Pinette, with anecdotes about his career and the reveal of his death cause: a pulmonary embolism.  A detailed, humorous analysis of the low-budget film "Bill" starring Mickey Rooney, including clips, followed.  The hosts showed a photo with Rooney and his wife, complaining about the wife's size.  The segment also included news items about a mystery pooper in a Michigan park, videos of women defecating in public (with authenticity debated), and updates on the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370.  A listener called to inquire about tickets for an upcoming Opie and Anthony "Unmasked" show at Caroline's Comedy Club, prompting a discussion of show details.

This segment featured a flight simulator gag, promotion of Opie's t-shirt business (opiradio.com/shop), and upcoming events like their Caroline's Unbroadway show with Ron Bennington, mentioning Dennis Falcone and E-Rock hosting the after-show.  Further discussion of John Pinette's death and comparisons to Mickey Rooney's death ensued.  Several commercial breaks occurred, followed by the post-show with Falcone and E-Rock, including listener calls, discussion of the hosts' performance, listener feedback on a host's speech patterns, and a discussion on the high rate of police suicides, speculating on the role of carrying firearms.  The conversation broadened to societal issues like education and legislation.  Patrice O'Neill was in studio, delivering a profane rant against Sarah McLachlan ASPCA commercials.  The final segment continued the societal issues discussion, touching on automotive safety features.

The show's final segment focused on information overload in the modern age, contrasting it with simpler times.  The hosts discussed the death of journalist Michael Hastings, hinting at a possible conspiracy. They debated humanity's ability to process constant global news, comparing it to the singular focus on Watergate or 9/11.  A humorous anecdote about an airline owner contacted late at night about disabling a plane's transponder highlighted the constant demand for immediate information.  Dunbar's number was mentioned, suggesting cognitive limitations in handling modern information. The conversation turned to mind-to-mind communication, citing advancements in prosthetic limb control and mind-controlled helicopters. Advancements in battery technology and the shift to digital systems were also discussed.  Finally, the hosts discussed a lawsuit against Adam Carolla for allegedly infringing on an online playlist patent, calling it absurd, and announced a legal defense fund at funanything.com/patenttroll.  The show concluded with advertisements.

[00:01:30]  The Opie and Anthony show is back.  The Opie and Anthony show is back.  And better than ever.  On Sirius XM.  Where's Roland going?  He just turned us on to some Bruce Bracey and then he walks down the hall.  Morning, everyone.  Good morning.  That scrapping guy is back.  I want to say hi to Richie in Staten Island. 
[00:02:00]  Richie.  Hey, how's it going?  We're talking about scrapping.  Scrapping, yeah.  I'm working at the scrapyard in Jersey City for the last nine years.  Yeah.  Operator.  Yeah.  We started primarily doing cars.  You know, ripping up cars and, you know, for all the precious metals and whatnot.  Over the last five years, he started doing scrap metal.  Went out, purchased a shredder, shredding plant.  And, you know, the material that we put out, we have buyers from pretty much all over the world. 
[00:02:30]  But primarily what you guys said, the Chinese are buying up everything.  We have, you know, actually, it's really more like door handles.  I mean, Chinese, Korea, Japanese.  For some reason, they seem to be, you know, pretty much buying up all of our stuff.  Yeah.  And it's just kind of amazing how the scrap business is kind of boomed because we have  people who come in with pickup trucks, who will load it up with anything that they see 
[00:03:00]  on, like, garbage day, you know, throughout the streets.  Right.  And literally have 20, 30 pickups, you know, making four or five trips a day, you know,  making whatever it is that they're making off the ground.  It's like a new industry.  Sure.  Yeah.  I mean, but it's just amazing because, like, say, like, like we say, the summertime,  last couple of years, it's been, you know, very hot, 100 degrees plus, whatever.  And we get more air conditioners in that you wouldn't think that people would be thrown 
[00:03:30]  out and shit.  So it's actually, this industry.  I love scrap metal.  Yeah, but I think it's, I find it kind of fascinating because you're right, it's like a,  it's a booming industry.  It's not a new industry, but it's certainly, certainly taking off lately.  And it's, it's kind of nice to have, you know, a lot of our garbage is going away because  that stuff, when we were growing up, just laid around in yards and this and that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess when the economy is a little shitty, it probably gets, uh, also, also the problem 
[00:04:00]  is, you know, you go into your new house and turn on the water and you got a flood  because somebody in the middle of the night took all your fucking copper pipes.  Cause some of that is happening too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know, there's so much competition out there that the people, people don't just  wait for, say, like garbage today.  They'll actually go out and, and make their own scrap per sec.  I just don't understand.  Like you see an old air conditioner.  Why is that valuable?  Copper inside it.  Oh yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Copper.  Copper tubes.  You got the, uh, ACR and stuff.  It's.  Compressor.  It's money.  Yeah.  It's money in the bank.  They will scrap frigging anything.  I mean, if people, people will, will, will mix, well, which we don't particularly like,  but they'll mix, you know, plastics and with metals.  You know, if it's got a sliver of frigging metal, they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll try  and scrap it.  It's just, it's just amazing.  It's got a lot of scrap.  Yeah.  It's a lot of scrap.  But I, I find it, uh, you know, and then you got the Chinese coming in and making these 
[00:05:00]  deals with you guys.  Oh yeah.  And how do you guys set, how do you guys, how do you guys set the prices?  Well, it, it, it goes, it goes by, uh, I guess, I guess I actually don't know.  I mean, there's gotta be something driving, driving metals.  I mean, I know, uh, on the, uh, commodity market, as far as aluminum and the copper goes,  how, how that works.  But this, uh, scrap metal or metal steel, I have no idea.  Cause as far as I know, there's no market for it. 
[00:05:30]  You know, so I, I don't know what drives it up.  And then what do they do?  And they just melt that shit down and mold some new stuff in China.  Yeah.  See, we, we, we, we have, we have exporters will come in and, and we'll ship directly to  them.  And then all of our other surplus will, will send up to big plants like upstate New York  and, and they'll actually refine it down.  They'll melt it down and then they'll ship it to wherever their buyers are.  All right.  What is this?  What is this clip?  China's ghost towns.  Yeah.  China builds all these like weird fucking towns for like their, their voyeuristic, uh, 
[00:06:00]  ways.  What do you mean?  They like, they'll build like Paris in the middle of China.  In the middle of China.  Yeah.  You try that little stuff.  Sure.  For some dumb reason.  By the way, that's how someone should turn the monitor.  Thank you so much.  Oh man.  Right.  But why are they doing that?  They, they just, they have money to spend.  Because they can.  Old English phone booths.  Right.  Right.  It's like the mid Epcot.  I don't have to watch them.  So wait, when you go there, is there anything inside of these?  Not to show.  No, no, no. 
[00:06:30]  They're just, yeah, they're just like fake buildings.  Facades.  Facades.  That's odd.  It's like Epcot.  Disney World.  All right.  All right, Richie.  Thank you, man.  All right, scrap guy.  I appreciate it.  I want to go to China.  You guys mind, mind, mind if I plug my job?  Oh boy.  Go ahead, man.  I'm sorry.  I don't, I wouldn't normally, but I'm, I'm, I'm looking for a raise.  Oh.  Go ahead.  All right.  Uh, we, I, I work at, uh, County Auto Rikers in, uh, Jersey City, New Jersey.  Jersey City.  All right.  Yeah.  And, uh, they, they, they pay the highest prices for scrap metal. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  All right.  Right.  Which is scrap metal.  Thank you.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, Liz, for scrap metal.  Bye, buddy.  Bye, guys.  All right.  Wow.  I'm an engineer for a cell phone company.  Scrapping is costing us a lot of money.  Wow.  Why?  Let's go to Joe in Chicago.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, buddy.  Hello, Joseph.  Hey, well, yeah.  Right now, I'm just finishing up doing all the 4G upgrades for all these cell sites.  And, uh, what I have to do is go to all the sites to make sure the construction companies  did what they're supposed to have done.  And about 85% of them, you know, it started off them just stealing the copper bus bars for, 
[00:07:30]  you know, lightning protection and stuff like that.  Now what they're doing is they're going into the AC units, ripping out the copper for that.  And they even have a couple sites where they're killing the power at the power lines and taking  that thick odd gauge wire from the actual power pole and ripping out hundreds of meters  of this stuff.  Yeah, some people get electrocuted.  It's hilarious. 
[00:08:00]  So they find people dead, like, on the side of a telephone pole, and, uh, you know, they  thought the power was off when it was on, or it was off, but the wire fell on power lines  that were on, and they wind up getting fucking zapped.  Unfortunately, I haven't had any of those yet.  Unfortunately, yeah.  So they're scrapping your towers.  They're scrapping.  We're at the point on the south side of Chicago where it's costing us too much to maintain them.  Yes.  It's what?  It's costing us too much to maintain them.  It's costing us too much to maintain them to have to go back and put all new copper in. 
[00:08:30]  We're just thinking about taking the towers down.  Wow.  It works to death.  Amazing.  Is that guy really getting zapped?  Guy twerks to death on power lines.  Oh, my God.  So that's why everybody's cell phones are going up and up and up.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's kidding.  Come on.  Wait, was he feeling something, you think?  Like, was he feeling something, uh...  I don't know.  Was that real?  Sorry.  I think the second he touched that one line went to the ground.  Right.  That metal line that he touches... 
[00:09:00]  He's fucking around there having fun.  He's twerking.  Oh, he's just fucking around, and then...  Right there.  Oh.  That looked fake.  That's fake.  Oh, it is.  That's fake.  Wait.  That looks real.  He fell exactly like he was.  Like, yeah, it was like a still picture of him falling out of frame.  You sure?  Let's see.  Hold on.  It's happened.  And if you guys want some fucked up shit, go to wirelessestimator.com, and you'll see  some gnarly stuff on that site.  It's all...  Everything in the industry.  Wouldn't you have followed him down with the camera? 
[00:09:30]  Now that you've pointed out, I was like, I've seen enough of those are real.  I've seen real ones.  You see the one with the scaffolding?  The four guys are pushing scaffolding out of this big garage thing, and it hits some overhead  lines, and all four of them get fucking zapped.  They fall.  They start burning.  One catches on fire.  There's smoke everywhere.  Jesus.  What'd they say?  Electricity's crazy.  Huh?  Get over it?  What?  I don't know.  Yeah, that's the one.  They come pushing this fucking scaffolding out.  It's in China or Korea?  There's no sound on it.  They're just like, yeah, here we go. 
[00:10:00]  Big metal scaffolding.  Right.  And they hit a fucking power line with it.  Wow.  That's all it takes, motherfucker.  And then they all just fucking get...  That's gotta be like...  They get stuck to it.  30 feet high at least, right?  Right there, look.  Wow.  That's it.  They're all just looking like they're fucking playing games there.  They all just kind of collapsed.  Oh, that guy's on fire on the left.  Are they dead?  And the one guy's feet are on fire.  The bottom of his feet are burning out.  Yeah.  Oh, they're all dead as shit, yeah. 
[00:10:30]  And he finally just lets go.  He's trying to let go.  But is he trying or is it just...  Well, it contracts your muscles, the electricity, so you'll hold on to something.  Very hard to get off of it.  Oh, my God.  That guy's just on fire.  Put this on our Facebook page.  Look at the amount of smoke coming off.  That one guy just will not let go.  Can you imagine how much electricity goes through you when the fucking bottom of your feet  starts shooting out of electricity?  Yeah.  You're cooked.  That's a live leak, huh?  You make a really fucking amazing resistor. 
[00:11:00]  You just fucking...  Wow.  All that fucking amperage just heating you up.  If he had...  What would he have had to have on his hands to not get zapped like that?  Like rubber gloves?  Well, magical gloves, I think.  Rubber gloves would have killed him, too?  I mean, there's nothing.  The power line has to be completely dead and it has to be shielded.  I bet rubber.  Because you're fucked.  Wow.  If you had those big rubber gloves.  What about big rubber shoes?  Insulate it.  But it could go through.  If the voltage and amperage is high enough, it could go through.  Like, it'll arc through. 
[00:11:30]  Is that why, though, people die?  Because it tightens your muscles up?  Yeah.  You go like...  Your muscles contract.  Why don't they go the other way?  I don't know.  They just contract.  So it's like...  Everything just fucking close.  Your hands close.  Your arms get them in tight.  What would happen if somebody...  It's like being tased.  If somebody was getting, like, zapped in a puddle and you ran and did, like, a flying leap and  jumped, knocked them out of the puddle, would that be okay?  Yeah.  I've heard of people that have done that.  Really?  They run and hit somebody off of a power line or something like that. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  And they live or no?  Quick contact, something like that.  I don't know.  I don't know if you'd live or not.  Well, you can...  Yeah.  It's happened before in our industry.  You're fucked.  You're burnt.  And the person that got you off, you're burnt, too.  But some people that live, most of them die.  The worst is when you see footage of people...  Someone's daughter that happened to...  When she got out of the car, they were going to something, and she stepped in the puddle.  And both of them died, I think, right? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because there's no way to see that coming.  No.  No.  So.  All right.  Let me move on there, Joe.  Thank you for the phone call.  We're going to go to Dan in Philly.  Dan.  Dan.  Yes.  How are you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  I just wanted to give you a quick heads up.  The reason why China buys all their scrap is they don't have a good source of iron ore,  so it's much cheaper for them to buy our stuff and re-melt it than it is.  So we're actually helping them take over the world.  So why don't we make that stuff super expensive? 
[00:13:00]  Make them pay a little bit, finally.  I think they'll just get it from somewhere else.  One of the biggest scrap dealers in the United States is in Newark, and over 80% of their scrap goes to China,  because they'll pay more than anybody else will.  So, I mean, it can go anywhere between $300, $600 a ton, and they'll take anything.  I mean, they take motors, and they'll melt the aluminum out of them, and they just get really cheap steel.  These are to melt it in an arc furnace than it is to process it in a blast furnace, 
[00:13:30]  which is taking raw coke and raw iron ore and make it into...  Iron coke, chromium steel.  Living here in Allentown.  But they're closing all the factories down.  Wow.  Sorry, guys.  Hey, do you think it hurts when you get an electric field like that, or are you out quickly?  I bet it hurts. 
[00:14:00]  Ah, for a split second.  How long?  That's what I wonder.  It depends on...  I don't know.  Some people live through it, and they're all fucked up.  Right.  I hate the touch of it.  Electricity.  I move shipping containers.  They're loaded with scrap.  I want to talk about the scrap metal.  Let me go to Joey in New York.  Joey.  Hello?  Hey.  Hello?  Hey, guys.  Listen.  Hi.  Excuse me?  Listen, my family is in the steel business.  We've had a family-owned business for over 100 years. 
[00:14:30]  You should buy stuff.  I'm really offended by what you guys are saying.  It's not that bad.  You've got to make money somehow.  So can you stop, please, the harassment and the bad name-calling that you called the steel  and the scrap metal community?  We're harassing the scrap metal community.  Well, you're giving it a bad name.  Yeah.  It's not nice.  I hear you.  Okay.  He's goofing.  He's goofing around.  You broke weed, dude.  Did you ever drink beers in school?  What's the matter with you?  I bet you never rip bongs in high school. 
[00:15:00]  Some bong hits.  Right?  Check out the empties, man.  Man.  Yeah, right now, bro.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  There he goes.  There's a video of an Indian guy electrocuting himself that you have to see.  You saw that one, right?  The guy on the top of the train?  That's a good one.  The one on the top of the train is really good.  Oh, yeah.  There's a crowded train there.  He's standing on the roof.  This dummy.  He grabs the power line or something. 
[00:15:30]  Why would you?  Well, because they ride on top of the trains in India.  Of course they do.  Why grab the power line?  Yeah, that was a dumb move.  I bet he thought that same question right when he did it.  Yeah.  Oh.  Why did I do that?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  He touches it and it instantly blows out.  Two big blasts.  And then you got a guy just walking away with his luggage like it's no big deal. 
[00:16:00]  He's on fire.  His head's on fire.  Yeah.  Bam.  That sound of pure fucking electricity.  Bam.  Bam.  That's a fast death.  Oh, yeah.  He's done.  That's a fucking microscope.  His balls were smoking.  You see that?  Yeah.  Smoky balls.  Damn.  But he was really walking like he knew what he was doing up there.  Oh, yeah.  He's like, oh, let me grab this.  Bump.  Oh, we've seen the guys flown in by helicopters, by the way, Matt.  We've done that. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  Those big, huge power lines where they drop them down.  Yeah.  And then they got to work on them and inspect them.  So they put them on top of the power lines by helicopter.  Right.  But they got to, like, take that stick and touch the wire with it so they could kind of equal out.  Right.  I still wouldn't do that.  That's true.  Can't you feel the electricity going through you when you're there?  I don't know.  I don't want to do this job.  They're wearing these weird outfits and the helicopter just kind of goes. 
[00:17:00]  I think these guys laugh at laptops on their groins.  I don't know what I mean.  Not only is it, like, electricity and shit, but they're so fucking high up.  Yeah.  And they just get out and sit on the fucking wires.  He's sitting on the fucking wire with a helicopter right next to it.  Well, what is he going to do?  Inspect the wires.  Fucking do any repairs.  Why don't you just go back and go, ah, we inspected the wires.  It looked good.  Yeah, it looked great.  It looked great.  They put these little wooden benches that they clip on the wires so they could sit. 
[00:17:30]  It's just fucking hot.  And then what are they going to do?  Now the, uh...  Are they going to move down the wire?  See, they've got to get the helicopter away now.  And they keep the wire attached to the helicopter, right?  Until the helicopter goes away far enough.  You see that arc comes off of it?  Because they don't want it arcing.  And hitting the helicopter?  And hitting the helicopter or hitting them or...  Yeah.  How do they figure that out?  Exactly.  Who was the first one that said, I have an idea.  This might work.  Get in the helicopter.  What?  Yeah, take metal.  Touch the wire. 
[00:18:00]  You'll get on and I'll fly away.  That would be great.  Give me a helicopter as much as I got arced and fucking fallen before.  Of course, let's get a little farther out.  It's O&A Show on Facebook.  All these videos we pop up there for you.  So, the ones we see during the show.  Science!  Uh, let's go to Bill in Georgia.  Bill?  Oh, Bill.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  We haul these shipping containers and we go into these scrap metal yards.  They take all that shit that everybody turns in and they just grind it up into little pieces.  And the guy just takes up like a front-end loader, you know, like a Bobcat loader and 
[00:18:30]  just fills the shit out of these things with just garbage.  I mean, look.  It's got pieces of foam rubber and just whatever they grind up.  That's been alleged.  Yeah, I've seen it.  These shipping containers literally look like they're filled with garbage.  It's garbage.  And it's extremely valuable.  But China's eating it up.  Yeah, yeah.  The other thing that they're doing down here in Georgia is we have, you know, a lot of  agriculture.  So, these fields have the irrigation systems on them. 
[00:19:00]  They call them a pivot.  It's got like a wellhead.  And then it's got like a sprinkler system.  It's like a mile long, you know, and it's got every hundred feet there's a drive tire  that has a motor on it that turns that tire.  These guys are going out in the fields and stealing all the copper wire off of these pivots  that go to those drive motors and they're hauling out miles with this wire.  And the farmer goes out there, you know, and his shit's all tore up.  Poor farmer.  Yeah.  Those things are hundreds of thousands of dollars.  No shit.  Yeah, they're just chopping the wire out of it. 
[00:19:30]  To give to China.  What are we doing?  Shanner.  What the fuck are we doing?  We had a guy just killed at the scrapyard here with that security guard guarding the  shit at night.  And a guy came in there and stole the whole bale that was already crushed into a bale  of copper.  And he shot the guard and they caught him.  And the reason he shot the guard was the fucker worked at the scrapyard and the guard knew  him.  So, on his way out, he killed him.  So, he wouldn't have to run him out.  Wow.  Good strategy anyway.  Yeah.  And someone else is saying scrap is a commodity.  Trade it every day now.  Oh.  I did not know that. 
[00:20:00]  It must be.  It's good business.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  All right, man.  See you.  And you know the guys from China with the scaffolding?  Yeah.  Brian has a little more of that.  Brian.  Let's see.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  I know you guys are just watching the video, but if you go a little further, one guy gets  up, gets zapped again, and then gets up and kind of walks off the screen and goes through  a door.  No.  Come on.  I swear.  You're thinking of a different video.  Not on that one.  I know the video he's thinking of, and that ain't it. 
[00:20:30]  But there was a lot more to this video, so.  Yeah.  There's no way one of these guys got up, so it just zips through itself.  No.  I know which one you're talking about.  The guy gets, like, zapped.  He gets struck by lightning or something.  And then he gets up, walks a little further, gets zapped again.  The guy's on fire.  So they're on fire.  These men are on fire.  Look at the guy's on fire.  He already get up and fucking put his shoes on, getting his shoes on.  All right, but let's play it out, just in case.  These guys are on fire.  Four guys doing nothing.  They're still napping, sir. 
[00:21:00]  Next one.  Napping.  Next one.  We're going, we're fast forwarding here.  I don't see.  Oh, the other guy's now on fire.  You couldn't find four deader guys.  Sir, these are the four deadest men in history.  Sir, no one got up.  Yeah, no one.  No one.  Using them as Yule logs.  Yes, he's on fire.  Poor smoldering employees.  And by the way, not even twitching when he's on fire, which usually shows that you're not alive.  You might be wrong on that one, sir.  I think you're wrong, sir.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Thank you, sir.  They were killed in a horrible way.  Right.  Completely killed.  Yeah.  But when your heels are shooting fire, you have zero chance of getting up.  From your hands, and it travels all the way through and burns out the bottom of your feet.  Yeah, yeah.  You are fucking doomed.  You're done.  You're done.  So, Roland's back in studio because he turned us on to some Springsteen shenanigans.  What the hell's going on with Springsteen?  Well, we got the NCAA final game tonight.  Yeah.  And they have all the top artists play for free. 
[00:22:00]  Hold on, though.  I want to say that Justin Stengel's the only one in America that's got a perfect bracket still.  Ooh.  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  No billion dollars?  I don't know if he decided not to do the Warren Buffett one, unfortunately.  Yeah, because he said the money would spoil him.  True.  He doesn't want to change.  Justin Stengel is getting a lot of heat.  A lot of big news outlets are interviewing him over his perfect bracket.  And the final game is tonight against UConn and Kentucky.  Who does he have? 
[00:22:30]  I don't know.  I've got to ask him.  My Kentucky shirt's on this way.  I've been all about UConn this entire season, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Shabazz.  Nice.  I've been all about UConn, so I say just throw it all.  If you've got some cash on you, just put it all on UConn.  UConn beating a lot of good teams, man.  Oh, yeah.  Teams they weren't supposed to beat.  That's it.  And now they're saying they don't even have a chance against Kentucky.  University of Kentucky.  Oh.  Word disturbs me.  Entenman's badminton competition in Kentucky. 
[00:23:00]  Playing badminton and eating Entenmans in Connecticut.  Why would you say that?  Just take the N out of Entenman's.  Make it Entenman's.  Just say Entenman's.  Entenman's.  Entenman's.  Entenman's.  Entenman's.  Did you eat that coffee cake that guy brought over? 
[00:23:30]  No.  He's still alive, isn't he?  I did.  How was it?  It was fucking great.  The shit gut's not going to take care of itself.  Got to make some...  I had a little piece right out of the middle.  Did you?  I took a knife and cut a square right out of the middle because I'm a grown-up and I can do that now without getting yelled at.  How good was it?  It was so good.  It was that perfect, like, cinnamon-y taste of crumb cake. 
[00:24:00]  It was so goddamn good.  Yeah.  Oh.  What'd you put on there?  Nothing.  I just ate it right there.  I like to pour on crumb cake.  I like to pour olive oil and capers.  That would be really bad.  This mudslide of flesh isn't going to remove itself.  I've got to make some decisions.  Oh, man.  I'm all in.  Yeah.  I'm all in to get back in shape.  Yeah.  But anyway, so Springsteen played what? 
[00:24:30]  A full show for free.  At least streamed it last night.  Two hours and 40 minutes, you're telling me?  What?  Yeah, they got this big, you know, because the final four games were Saturday and now the big game's tonight.  Why would he do that?  Like, what's Bruce's...  Yeah.  Look, Bruce doesn't need fucking exposure.  But for a new audience, though.  No, he could sell out arenas for multiple nights on end.  He's done it.  Everyone knows who Bruce is.  Everyone knows what he's all about.  There's not anyone that needs exposure to see Bruce to go like, oh, is that Bruce? 
[00:25:00]  The younger audience.  But also it's a different band.  It's just Tom Morello.  Now it's Little Steven.  Is Bruce the guy that's singing the song?  Is Bruce playing guitar?  Yes.  Is Little Steven there?  No.  I think that makes a good point.  I think this guy is probably bored with his life and has nothing else going on for himself.  So he forces his poor band to do two-hour and 40-minute concerts on a Sunday night.  Gratis.  It's a three-day music festival.  No, I know.  I bet it's also for the young audience. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, it's all the college kids.  Very smart.  He probably sells so many fucking records on that.  He's a billionaire.  I'm with Ed.  Relax.  Enjoy your life a little bit.  Amazing.  He likes to do.  For free.  He can't like singing Rosalita again.  He didn't.  Oh.  But he opened up with a new song, though.  He opened up with a new song.  There you go.  The cover.  We got it queued up?  Yeah.  Does he tell a little story?  Guys, wait.  He's got a basketball.  He gives the ref the basketball. 
[00:26:00]  It's a guitar tech.  That's kind of douchey.  He puts a guitar on.  He wears the same outfit in every show.  Oh, no.  Oh, they're going to do a jump ball between two guitars.  Oh, no.  Why are they jump balling?  And then they hit it into the crowd.  And now they're playing jump?  Yeah.  Why are they hitting the ball?  Because there's jump.  It's basketball.  They jump.  Who's that dude?  That's his wife.  That's who?  That's his wife.  Oh, that one.  Miss Scalper. 
[00:26:30]  I thought it was Nick Cannon.  The one that stole away from his other chick back in the day.  The one that was in the video.  He blew off the hot chick.  Yeah.  For the, uh, you know.  How long is this intro?  Nice.  Sounds like a high school version.  Oh, no.  It sucked.  That sucked.  This is terrible.  Ha ha.  Oh, no. 
[00:27:00]  They're all wearing hats.  Where is this?  Dallas.  It's cold.  Oh, it must be freezing.  Oh, this is awful.  I gotta hear the hook, though.  Oh, yeah.  Should I have her?  Patrick Stewart?  Yeah, right.  Patrick Stewart on keyboard.  Do you like this?  No.  This is horrible.  No.  This is horrible. 
[00:27:30]  It's a record machine.  I ain't sure what I see.  Uh-oh.  Oh, can you see what I mean?  Uh-oh.  Why does it end there?  Come on.  What happens?  Does he jump or not?  Was that Warren Haynes playing with him?  No.  The guy looked like Warren.  It just slaps there.  Sal just makes this decision that we've heard enough.  Oh, there it goes.  Oh, God. 
[00:28:00]  That is Warren Haynes, right?  On the left?  No.  He's got a fat guy in his band.  Yeah.  It's Charlie.  He plays that.  Wow.  Charlie!  That was really exquisitely bad.  I didn't care for that.  And in the other concert, he covered Lord Royal.  Really?  Yeah.  Was that good?  Oh, yeah.  I like all his covers.  No.  I wouldn't mind a cover.  That was a horrible cover.  Come on, Roland. 
[00:28:30]  I know you love Bruce.  That was really bad.  But fuck, you've got to just go, you know.  That was terrible.  No.  It was...  We didn't come from money.  Wow.  And every fucking song was full of T-shirts, stripping in the bathroom, blood-stained ball gowns, trash in the hotel room.  I don't care.  I drive a Cadillac in my dreams.  Everybody's like Cristal made back.  Diamonds win your timepiece.  Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash. 
[00:29:00]  I don't care.  I'm not caught up in your love affair.  And I'll never be rolling up.  I don't run in our blood.  I don't know this song.  You know this song.  I don't.  Who sings it?  Lord.  Lord.  You know the original.  There's no way you don't know the original.  Let me hear the original.  I don't know it.  Sorry.  This is fucked.  Why is he doing this?  He's got eight million songs.  That people want to hear him sing. 
[00:29:30]  He's doing, like, rare covers of different things.  It's awful.  And everybody that's at this show wants to hear a hit.  Not some fucking cover piece of shit from Bruce doing it poorly.  I want to hear fucking Tunnel of Love.  In this tunnel of love.  Give me a point to run.  Maybe we were born to run.  Come on, Wendy.  Can you play the original for Jimmy?  I mean, he knows Lord Royale's home. 
[00:30:00]  Space thing did a horrible job with this song.  She's like the 17-year-old New Zealand chick?  Yeah.  Or wherever she's from.  With the curly hair.  This is good.  She's kind of like cute for two seconds in a video.  And then...  Yeah, they cleaned her up nice.  She's brutal looking.  Wow, is that her...  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Nice fat rump, though.  She's a little dumpy.  Wouldn't mind spanking her.  Oh, my God.  She hugs Jim from work.  She doesn't have a hint of a shape on her body.  Yeah, and actually her name was Lard.  Wow.  Right, yo!  I got to hear the Honey Bee part.  I crave a different kind of buzz.  Let me be your ruler. 
[00:31:00]  Ruler.  You can call me Queen Bee.  Or Queen Bee.  What does she have?  That fucking...  What does she have?  Listen.  Ruler?  Oh, look.  Wow.  Fuck, wait a minute.  What is that?  They turned her ass around on purpose, right?  No, that's a real photo.  That's not a real photo.  What is that?  Wait a minute.  Is that the Grammys?  She has big thighs.  That doesn't make sense.  No, I can't make that out.  Nah, someone's fucking around.  That's her ass.  No, because that would be a hard one.  They turned your body around, right?  No, that's a real photo.  Is that real? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  I'm trying to figure it out.  I can't figure out what's going on there.  Nah, someone's fucking with that.  No one has that.  It's like she's got those giant balls.  Thunder thighs.  Yeah?  Thunder thighs?  I don't know.  That's a weird picture.  It's not real.  That's her ass.  They just flipped the picture.  Or she's wearing Spanx.  She might have like one of those gut things.  I don't know what the fuck that is, but I want no part of it. 
[00:32:00]  Breaking news.  Yeah?  People are...  Can you turn this off?  People are saying that the guy absolutely gets up.  I was Twittering me now, too.  He does not get up.  We saw the end of it, dumbbells.  They're saying he gets up like...  I think he goes back down, but I think he gets up for a little bit.  Which guy?  Is everyone looking at the same video?  No, they're not.  They're saying around four minutes in.  Come on.  No one's been on fire for four minutes and then gets up.  What the fuck's wrong with you people? 
[00:32:30]  All right.  You went a little before...  How long is the video?  You went a little before the four minutes, right?  Okay.  Where are we at now?  3.55.  3.55.  All right.  Let's see if anyone gets up.  Let's see.  You can't see through the smoke of burning people if someone's getting up.  It's very difficult to see because people are on fire.  Which guy is what they're saying does?  Is it the same video?  No.  They have to tell me another video.  Could someone give us the time stamp on where the guy gets up and walks up?  He doesn't get up.  So dead.  Then he comes back and he missed it. 
[00:33:00]  We're looking at a forest fire.  No one's getting up.  No one is getting up.  Where's the time stamp?  Yeah, where?  Hold on.  Let me go to Jim in Virginia.  Jim, you're representing a lot of people.  Absolutely.  At four minutes and 11 seconds.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Between them.  That guy got up.  I'm wrong.  Wait, go back.  The one guy got up.  Which guy?  The guy right there in the...  On the far left is where the two people are laying down together.  That guy.  Oh, wow. 
[00:33:30]  But I didn't see the two guys.  Watch this guy.  Laying down.  I saw this.  I can't believe it.  We're wrong.  He's the one that nothing was arcing on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's the only guy that nothing was arcing on.  But wasn't the other guy's shoes on fire?  Yes.  Hey, look.  There he goes.  He gets up.  He gets zapped again.  And he runs out.  Did he come back?  And take up his position in the fucking smoldering?  Yeah, what happened?  What do you think happened?  Holy fuck.  You guys are right.  Did he happen to let go immediately? 
[00:34:00]  Can you go back to the beginning?  Yeah, go to the beginning.  Let's see what happened to him.  Did he just drop it like...  I just assumed it was those three guys.  Wait.  There's only three guys.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  What happened?  Hold on a minute.  Play this.  What the fuck?  Huh?  Watch it from the top.  I thought there were four.  What happened?  That one guy wasn't there in the...  Yeah, the one guy wasn't there.  Maybe one guy...  It was four guys.  One, two, three...  There's one in the back.  Four.  Three...  Four.  There's four guys.  All right.  There's the four guys. 
[00:34:30]  Okay.  They turn this fucking thing around, and then all hell breaks loose.  You know, this one guy is holding out...  They're all holding out with both hands.  He's on it for a fucking minute, man.  He's hanging on there.  Wait a minute.  But where does that guy come from?  Yeah, because he...  He ends up over there next to the other guy.  Maybe he tries to get up and falls back down.  We were too busy laughing and pointing.  Yes.  Wow.  But he let go first before anybody.  Because hands on fire.  Yeah, he let go quicker than anyone.  All right.  That guy's burning because he's too close to the pole. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, now he just let go.  Holy shit.  That guy's getting like...  But he's getting fired, blasting through his groin.  Yeah, zip through there a little.  Now, let's just see when this guy gets up and falls again.  Yeah, yeah.  See when he moves over to that other area.  All right, all right.  There's him.  Wait, it's that guy.  It's another guy.  All right, let's see.  All right, hold on.  So he gets zapped again.  It's the guy on the left.  We're going to put this...  Why would he duck under it instead of going around it?  What an asshole.  This video is...  He just got electrocuted, Jim.  Okay, but you still... 
[00:35:30]  No matter how much shock you're in,  you don't walk under the electrocution area.  And I think Jim was going for a joke more than anything.  There he goes.  Wow, he gets up, and he goes under it again.  Why would you do that?  Because he's dumb.  You're an idiot.  And then he gets...  Oh!  And he bumps into it again, this fucking clot,  and wraps around the metal.  You survived, and he bumps into it.  He walked in and bumped into the metal again.  What a dump.  I'm with Jimmy now.  Why would you bump into it again?  Holy shit.  And now he's down again, and that's why he's in that position. 
[00:36:00]  Now he's only over there.  Right, okay.  God.  I wonder if he's...  Can we follow him up?  Is this guy alive or no?  Nice attentive fucking place this is.  Right.  This human fucking flesh smoke.  Right.  Permeating the establishment,  and no one comes out to see where it's coming from.  I just figured it was the toy factory.  It was a flight time.  It was one time.  We had to go get something to eat.  All right.  What's the story, man?  What's the story, morning glory?  You got anything on this guy there? 
[00:36:30]  No, sir.  I don't have anything.  No, I'm asking the mustache kid.  It says he was crying, this guy.  He was crying for help.  And...  Tell us something we don't know.  What happened to the guy that walked away?  Yeah, yeah.  That's all we want to know.  Any updates?  These guys were all right.  Hope he was punished for laying down the job.  Exactly.  We would make horrible witnesses.  We're horrible radio hosts.  No, they all died.  Right. 
[00:37:00]  And we're insistent.  Did they?  That guy died?  No, I mean...  Oh, because he banged into the thing again?  Maybe he would have been fucking fine  if he didn't bang into it and wrap around more metal.  And then...  Right.  Yeah.  Then he walked off.  They don't really tell you anything.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  From Virginia.  All right, brother.  Bruce is doing these covers for the college kids.  We figured as much.  No, I am.  Why jump?  That's from 1983.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Where are you, too?  Oh, this guy might have a...  Barry in California.  Barry.  Barry.  Hey, what's up? 
[00:37:30]  Hey.  Hey, I'm a lineman for utility out in California.  We deal with...  Drive to main road?  Oh, the lineman.  Very good.  And basically, what's going on is, because that's a big metal tower, it's taking most  of the brunt of the electricity going to ground, and they're just basically bleeding off some  of it.  That's why that guy was able to get up and walk away.  We've had guys come into contact with 12,000 volts, go through their body, and they live.  Yeah, but the other guys were on fire. 
[00:38:00]  Why did he live, sir?  Because the electric tower, or the, I'm sorry, the metal tower that they're pushing around,  it's taking the brunt of the force that's taking it to ground.  Oh.  So they're just basically bleeding off a little bit of it.  That's pretty much what it is.  Right.  Why would he have people on fire?  Yeah, the other guys are on fire pretty good.  There's no doubt.  I mean, it's just like with lightning.  Guys have had their shit, where their feet get blown off, where they live, or their shoes  get blown off. 
[00:38:30]  It's weird.  Electricity is a very strange thing.  My shoes got blown off once.  No, they didn't chip off.  Yeah, they did.  I got shocked by lightning.  Yeah, what happened?  I'm sure they did chip off.  Chip off.  All right, thank you.  It's electric.  Yep.  This one's for Roland, before you leave us, Roland.  It's Bruce.  Go ahead, sir.  Daniel?  Yellow.  Daniel?  You're on the air.  Daniel?  Call her?  Yeah.  You.  Go.  Bruce Brayne sucks dick. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, shit.  Roland?  Coming.  Oh, that guy's on a fashion of some wires.  Yeah.  Well, that didn't go as well as I thought it would.  They're showing a hot air balloon hitting some fucking electrical wires right there.  Right.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  That's fucking scary.  That Mozilla guy getting ousted or having been forced to step down.  Crazy.  Because he donated money to a group that was fighting gay marriage in 2008. 
[00:39:30]  And Bill Maher pointed out, or one of Bill Maher's guests pointed out, hey, back then Obama  was against gay marriage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he gave like a few bucks.  Thousand dollars.  Thousand bucks.  And then OK Cupid, who Mozilla, I guess OK Cupid was their biggest hit.  Mm-hmm.  These motherfuckers wouldn't allow any Mozilla traffic to come to their site.  So to get to OK Cupid, like, this guy does something in his own private, and again, I think 
[00:40:00]  he's a cocksucker because I don't agree with what he said.  I think that's a shit cause.  Right.  But how can we operate like that?  That's unbelievable.  And how many years ago did he do that?  2008.  Intimidation.  2008, so six years ago.  The company should have stood by him.  Well, of course.  They have to.  Fuckers.  You now have to have a perfect life.  Perfect.  Perfect, perfect.  And your opinions, keep them to yourself, even if you're asked for them. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, God, yeah.  Why would you give an opinion at this point?  It's intimidation.  Yeah, Bill Maher said there's definitely a gay mafia.  He goes, if you fuck up, they'll whack you.  Which is kind of funny.  Well, I mean, gay people are probably tired of fucking.  Like, having to deal with this shit.  I don't know.  But OK, Cupid banning traffic.  Like, you can't do that.  No.  That's not the free market. 
[00:41:00]  Someone from the, I think, Gladys, that's a free market.  That's not the free market.  If none of your customers are using it, that's the free market.  But a company just going, no more access.  We don't like your opinion.  Yeah.  That's not free market.  And did he give $1,000 to a group that specifically was against gay marriage?  Or was it a group that one of their things was that they were against gay marriage and it's just another political contribution?  Oh, no.  Because that's even worse.  It was a ballot initiative that would ban same-sex marriage in California. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, OK.  So I think the guy's a jerk-off for his stance.  I think his stance is shit.  He's a big, fat fuck.  But you have to be able to be a big, fat fucking idiot.  And if it's put to a vote and you're promoting one side of the vote, it's not like it's this underground fucking KKK shit.  It's democracy in action.  They're voting.  He's got an opinion and a right to vote whichever way he wants them to support whatever candidate or bill that he wants passed or any proposition without these consequences like this. 
[00:42:00]  That's insane to do that.  It's mob tactics, classic intimidation.  But no one's speaking up.  Nah, why would they?  No one's speaking up.  If gay people say, look, fuck this guy, we think that he's actively lobbying against us.  He's not just saying, I don't like gay people.  Right.  He's trying to have our lives inconvenienced.  Uh-huh.  He's trying to not give us the same rights as straight people.  So I get why gay people would hate this guy's guts. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Then don't use Mozilla.  That's, to me, the free market.  Right.  Yeah.  Blocking access from OkCupid is dangerous, man.  You just don't use it if you don't.  You know what the worst part is?  It's the fucking company, letting him go as CEO.  Like, fuck that.  He might have resigned.  It might have been his decision.  I don't know.  Even so, you shouldn't have to.  If the gays want to protest or do whatever they want, that's fine.  But companies and people and entities, whatever, have to stand firm and not give in to these  things, because that's when it becomes effective intimidation. 
[00:43:00]  Who are you talking to?  I think there's some people on the other side of this.  No.  Apparently there's a membrane that vibrates and sends electricity through the mic.  I'm not even being a dick.  I'm saying it in a way that no one's going to listen to you.  No, no.  They've got to start listening.  Yeah.  This company would do the same fucking thing.  Of course.  Out.  Out.  The fact that he's lobbying against gay marriage and giving money, it's like, what  are you so worried about?  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Why can't you that?  I do hate this guy.  Yeah.  But again, he's got to be able to say that.  He's got his fucking stance.  And again, like I said, it's a legitimate legal election.  It's a bill that's trying to or proposition.  It's not some underground thing.  This is democracy in action.  And there are plenty of countries where you're killed for voting a certain way.  Right.  To have that kind of intimidation on a vote is very dangerous. 
[00:44:00]  Because what if it's not just a proposition?  What if it's a candidate?  And, you know, you get that type of intimidation.  I think we saw that when the Black Panthers were in front of some of the polling places  during Obama's first term election.  But, I mean, it's classic intimidation.  Let's go to Jay in South Florida.  Jay.  Jay.  Hey, so the OKCupid CEO, I had just read this last night, actually.  They found out that he donated $500 to Chris Cannon a few years ago, who has, like, the 
[00:44:30]  worst record for supporting gay rights in Congress.  There you go.  He, uh, this OKCupid thing is a big, I'm in the online dating business, actually, and  this OKCupid thing is just a PR stunt.  Oh, okay.  It's all a big PR stunt.  It's just, um, frightening that people who are speaking out and not going with gay marriage,  like, I'm caught in the middle because I hate them.  Like, I really do hate their opinion.  I agree, but it's complete fucking bullshit to ruin this guy's career and his business 
[00:45:00]  over this.  That's it.  It's completely illegal what he's doing.  I would rather this guy get caught blowing someone in a rest area and have his life ruined  like that, or fall down an elevator shaft because he's a twat.  Yeah.  But just when someone is voicing their opinion, it is frightening when there's penalties.  By the way, all the people that when we do, like, you know, say, like, you can't, you  shouldn't fire people for saying stuff.  Uh-huh.  Well, doesn't the company have a right to represent them? 
[00:45:30]  This is where it leads.  So all you people that were saying, like, hey, yeah, man, this company does have a right  to get away with this guy because he did racial jokes or whatever, or he made a racist  statement, this is where it goes.  Yeah.  This is the next step.  Now this guy is just donating to a cause that he believes in.  Yep.  And they're fired.  You know, or he's being pressure is forcing.  Yeah, exactly.  There was just recently a whole to-do about PAC money and who can donate what to a candidate  or a proposition.  And it's completely protected under the First Amendment. 
[00:46:00]  It's your First Amendment right to be able to support a candidate or a proposition as you  feel you want.  And to have this happen because of it, it's a direct consequence based on the guy's freedom  that he has, his legitimate right as an American citizen.  Yeah, like...  Hold on, Trav.  Pardon my interruption, Trav.  Is this...  Before I forget, is this a...  Someone said they didn't block Firefox.  They displayed a message saying the Mozilla CEO contributed to anti-gay marriage. 
[00:46:30]  A lot of people saying that OKCupid wasn't actually blocking anyone.  Okay.  I'm reading that they called for a boycott.  Oh, okay.  Right.  Then I might...  Boy.  But people say that, you know...  Boycott.  A boycott.  With a boy on it.  Right.  How old are we?  I know.  So funny.  It's a boycott.  Yes.  People say that his views are intolerant, but isn't it like forcing someone to resign?  That seems like a little intolerant.  Being intolerant to his views?  Yeah, but what I didn't like was...  I'm saying glad. 
[00:47:00]  I think it was glad.  But it was some spokesman who said, oh, that's nonsense.  That's a subjugation of the word.  No, it's not.  No.  Intolerance does work both ways.  Isn't it funny that glad is always mad?  It's just ironic.  They're constantly mad.  But anyone who's out there lobbying against gay marriage, you really got to look at yourself  in the mirror and go, what the fuck?  Is it my business what other Americans are doing?  You really are a shithead if you're out fighting.  Yeah.  I'm even trying to think of a good devil's advocate point of view on this, and it's very 
[00:47:30]  difficult to come up with one.  I cannot think of one reason.  Yeah, yeah.  Like I said, though, if you're supporting a candidate or a bill where one part of it  includes the protection or sanctity of fucking marriage, whatever they want to call it,  then you have a little more of a defense, because it's like, all right, look, I'm not really  for that, but I like everything else in the bill, or I like everything else this candidate's  doing.  You got to kind of compromise.  But if you're just putting money to stop gay marriage, yeah, that's a little odd. 
[00:48:00]  Like, who gives a fuck, really?  All right.  We should take a break, because I think Morgan Spurlock is here.  I say them homos should be able to do whatever the fuck they want, just like us regular people,  right?  Am I right?  Well, you probably could have said that better.  All right.  But the sentiment is appreciated, I'm sure, but however you're phrasing it, it might  lack something to be desired.  Okay.  However, people probably think we're happy you're for us, but could you not say them homos?  Point taken, point taken.

My English bulldog, Timothy, used to have hot spots and areas on his side and stuff.  His immune system was terrible.  And we've taken him to allergists, veterinarians.  And we probably spent, oh, probably $300 to $400 every four months on him.  And one day I heard a Dynavite commercial and they were talking about everything to a T what Timothy had on his skin rash, his itching, his smell, his ears, everything. 
[00:54:00]  So I figured, what the heck, and I got on Dynavite.com.  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E dot com.  859-428-1000.  Ever since he's had Dynavite, he's been a happy camper.

So now all I have to do is say, do you want your Dynavite?  And he runs to where his food is and he likes it.

When you get one, it's amazing.  When you get two, it's like a miracle.  Knocking on wood for three.  We'll see.  I tried watching it.  I had a problem with the last.  I was so annoyed because the link kept crapping out.  I'm watching the paparazzi one where you're hanging out with the paparazzi.  Yeah.  And there's that, I don't forget the guy's name, but you're like kind of lurking and they  get the photo of, who's that actress that you got coming out of the fucking like yoga  place or whatever. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, she stopped, looked at you guys and kept going.  Oh, what's that girl's name?  Yes.  I am.  Pretty.  I'm like the worst.  I was the worst paparazzi because I was like, that person looks like somebody.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  No, it is.  Yeah.  It's, it was the, she's, um.  Britney something?  No.  No.  She was one of the, one of like the Hills girls and, uh, and Giles knew who she was.  Oh, really?  She's like, oh, that's blah, blah, blah.  And I was like, Ashley Tisdale.  Ashley Tisdale.  That's exactly who it was.  So you were, you were, uh, being a paparazzi for the day just to see what they go through?  Yeah.  Well, this, this whole, this whole episode is all about like our fascination with celebrity.  Like why, why have we gotten to the point where these are the people that we put on 
[00:59:00]  the covers of magazines?  These are the people we idolize.  And so it's all about just like obsession with fame with celebrity.  I don't get it either.  It's crazy.  And it's, and it's a multi-billion dollar industry, like $3 billion a year generated by  the magazines, TMZ, the world, like all, it's nuts, dude.  Were you able to get the, uh, gist of what, uh, these guys, not,  go through because I, I barely, I don't really have much sympathy for them.  I don't know if you do now, the paparazzi, the celebrities, the paparazzi, because you  start to have some very little sympathy for both sides of both sides. 
[00:59:30]  That's what I was going to ask you too, about, uh, if, if you do have any sympathy for them,  but did you, were you feeling the wrath of some of these celebrities?  You know, it's like, uh, we, we were, I was at the, there's a scene where I'm at the  airport as Kim Kardashian's flying in from Paris and there's like 50, there's like 50  photographers there and I'm there trying to like get a picture along with like  50 other yahoos, you know, trying to get a shot as, as the giant security guards  has come out with her, just come barreling through the crowd, knocking like the crap  out of people, getting you out of the way.  And so it's like, you're, then you're there in front of them and the guy just 
[01:00:00]  like, Oh, give you the Heisman, you know, right.  Wow.  Yeah.  And so, uh, so you start to re you start to have a little sympathy for these guys  cause they, they do have a tough job.  Um, and these are, some of the guys are people with families and kids who are just  trying to make a living.  And then there's, you know, there are guys who are a bit more dodgy, but I think  that's, but it's like, it's any business.  But yeah, don't the celebrities work with the paparazzi too.  That's the amazing thing that you learned.  I learned over the course of doing this episode is Kim Kardashian calls ahead, of  course, and tells the paps when she's arriving at places. 
[01:00:30]  Right.  And not only that, but you know, when you're a photographer, you have an  account at an agency.  And so every time you get a picture that's taken, you know, it goes into the  agency and then you get money from it.  Right.  They have their own account.  The Kardashians have their own account at a photo agency.  So now they call the photographers, photographers come take the pictures.  They take the pictures.  They get a kick out of every picture that gets smart.  Wait, who does the Kardashians?  Kardashians have their own account.  Because they love the notoriety.  I mean, there are some celebrities that don't want any body intruding on their 
[01:01:00]  lives, but they love it.  But those are the ones you don't hear about.  That's right.  Because I've heard over the years that these guys all call the paparazzi and  say, hey, I'm going to blah, blah.  I'll be there.  I'll be there at this time.  And all of a sudden it's like this snapshot.  You're like, how the fuck did they get that picture?  Yeah, yeah.  That's right.  But it was set up ahead of time.  And that's what you realize.  And that's what...  And then the celebrity acts like, oh, God, no, please, no.  No, stop.  Get out of my face.  Yeah.  And that's...  But their business is being in the tabloids.  Right.  She doesn't have a job. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  You know, Kim Kardashian doesn't have a job.  But that fuels her celebrity.  There's nothing else she can do.  So why would she not enjoy that?  That's right.  And call up the paparazzi.  That's right.  And what about the rest of the paparazzi guys?  Did you get along with them?  Yeah.  I mean, it's like they...  You know, there were guys that were making fun of me for being there  because I am a terrible photographer.  I am, like, absolutely the worst photographer ever.  But, you know, they brought me in.  They kind of showed me the ropes of what they do. 
[01:02:00]  And there's guys who do different things.  Like, there's the guys who wait at the airports.  Like, there's TMZS guys who do nothing but stand there  and just wait for flights from New York to come in.  Right.  You know, and then...  Do they know who's going to be on them or no?  They do.  That's the other weird thing is you start to realize  that there's people who work at the airlines  that call them and give them tips.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah.  For a little taste.  They get their taste.  So they're like at the airport.  It's like a casino with the guy that we used to call Pesci's character.  That's right.  The hotel guy, the parking lot guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's not going to be in his room today.  It's the same thing.  Same thing.  Exactly the same thing. 
[01:02:30]  So there's people at every airline...  Like, these guys have tipsters at every airline that call ahead  and say, so-and-so's on this flight flying to L.A.  So when they land, they're waiting at the airport.  It's crazy.  Wow.  Yeah.  Do those people get in trouble, though?  The airline people?  And if they found out, I'm sure they probably would.  Yeah, they'd probably keep it on the QT.  They keep that.  How much money is involved in some of this stuff?  Well, it's like...  It's crazy.  Some of the money is nuts.  Like, the guy that I spent the most time with was this guy named Giles.  Amazing guy.  His whole thing is...  He just fishes all day long.  So he drives around L.A. in his car. 
[01:03:00]  And what he does, he just waits to catch somebody.  Like, here's, you know, somebody going in the store and getting a latte.  And then he takes a picture of them.  Because he does all, like, the stars are just like us photos.  Where you see somebody walking out of a Piggly Wiggly with toilet paper.  Yeah, look at that.  That's his gig.  Yul Brenner has to shit.  He's just like us.  He shits just like us.  Yeah, it's amazing.  It's amazing.  When you go to L.A., all you have to do is go to a Starbucks.  And you're guaranteed to see at least one or two celebrities. 
[01:03:30]  Somebody will wander in.  In the morning.  Are there places that they just know, like, this is where they hang out?  Yeah, one street in L.A.  They'll go to.  Well, there's the one where the Ivy is.  Where the Ivy is.  They go there.  And then there's, like, in Brickwood.  Robertson in L.A. is a huge one.  And the celebrities know that.  Where the paparazzi camp out, if they have nothing else, if they're not doing an airport run or whatever,  they'll camp out on Robertson knowing that celebrities are coming through.  That's exactly right.  And it's the ones that really are looking for the attention, too. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  And then they act like, oh, God, stop.  What are you doing?  I'm just trying to go to the Ivy for lunch.  But everyone knows you go there specifically to get your picture taken.  As you have a table out on the patio.  Exactly.  Where everyone can see you anyway.  Everyone sees you.  Well, two Kardashian calls them.  Why does she rush through and look down?  That's part of the act.  It's part of the act.  Yeah, it's the spin.  It's all bullshit is what I'm trying to say.  I don't get it, though.  Don't.  For every celebrity standing up going, you know, the paparazzi are really intrusive.  Yeah.  Most of them know that it's all one big fucking game. 
[01:04:30]  That's right.  This shit wouldn't happen without the demand for it.  So what do you think that is?  What is this fascination?  I mean, a lot of it is, you know, when times are tough, you know, people are looking for any outlet to feel better, feel good about themselves.  And any time you can look at somebody, oh, look, their life looks so much better than mine.  And, you know, and look at how happy they are on that red carpet.  And look at their beautiful house and their kids.  I don't think people would like that, though.  Isn't it depressing to be like, oh, God, my life sucks?  But I think some people look at it as just like a little bit of escape.  Living vicariously through. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  In the middle of like your really terrible day, you buy this, you know, $1.95 magazine.  And you can look at it and be like, oh, look at how beautiful she is.  Bikini bods where they circle the problem.  That's always good.  You've got to guess who it is.  Worst bikini of the year.  Right.  Who doesn't do that?  I would guess that's a big picture to get.  Any starlet at the beach in a bikini.  With like a big jelly ass.  Right, right.  With something wrong.  Yes.  Somebody has a big cottage cheese behind.  That's a lord ass.  You will clean up.  You will clean up with those photos. 
[01:05:30]  But that's all back to the cost.  So Giles, who drives around and takes those pictures, he'll take, you know, with the photos he takes, he'll make anywhere between $50 to $100 per picture average, usually during the day.  That's all?  But he'll take anywhere from 10 to 15 photos that he can sell a day.  That's okay.  So he'll make, he says, so I average about, you know, so you figure if I make $1,000 a day, so he's making $350, $360 a year.  Right.  On average.  Yeah.  And every day he gets up, he gets up, he drives his circuit, takes pictures, loads them up, and that's all he does. 
[01:06:00]  And just knows where the celebrity's going to be.  Yeah.  Like we were taking their regular stuff.  And he drives around, he scouts through, we were at, like, we saw the Gold's Gym, and he goes, let's just see who's working out in Gold's Gym.  And so we go up and he looks through the fence and there's Ray Liotta in the back.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  He's like, he's like, hold on, I'm going to get a picture of Ray Liotta.  And I was like, is Ray Liotta all sweaty, like really worth some money?  He's like, oh, yeah, I'll sell this.  This will be worth a year, $300, $400.  I'm like, wow, who knew?  Wow.  It's amazing.  So it really is like fishing.  It is, completely.  You don't know what you're going to get.  Oh, I got one on the line. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, yeah.  What was the best one he got while you were with him?  The best one, the best one he got, Ashley Tisdale's probably a good one because she was coming out of yoga, like wearing her yoga clothes, her little tight pants, you know, the yoga nits.  What was that?  I'm sorry.  Ashley Tisdale.  Oh, oh, that girl.  So that girl coming out, that was probably a good one.  Who else did we see?  We chased Jamie Lee Curtis.  She gave him the finger for taking a picture.  She don't like.  She does not like the paps.  No, no, especially these days.  And then, oh, I tell you the one that was fantastic.  So we were driving down the road and we saw these people waiting outside of a house. 
[01:07:00]  We're like, what is going on?  What are all these paps doing out here?  And they're like, oh, yeah, Reese Witherspoon's inside.  So there's guys who chase certain celebrities around town just because they're valuable.  Right.  And Reese Witherspoon is one of those.  Jennifer Garner's one.  So if people know where they are, they'll stalk them.  They'll wait outside for them to come out, take pictures of them, chase them to where their next destination is.  And this is where it gets dangerous because these guys literally will chase them to where they're going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get to the point where they have enough pictures of the one celebrity instead of like chasing them to every location they're going to. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  I mean, that's some of them will take a picture and stop.  That's good.  And some poppers will be like, hey, can I just get a photograph?  They'll take theirs and they'll leave.  Right.  But then there's other guys that just chase them all day long because they know this person will get me money constantly.  Right.  Yeah.  Jeez.  I understand why the celebrities hate them, though.  Because, like, yeah, you're a celebrity, but there's a point where you're just taking your kid to school.  Yeah.  And they complain about their kids being used in photos.  That's right.  Like, what magazine uses them, like People or whatever or Us Weekly?  Yeah.  If the celebrities just boycotted and said any kid photo used without the person's consent, none of us will appear in that magazine, Us would stop doing it. 
[01:08:00]  That's exactly right.  And that's one of the things we talk about in the show is that if there's a guy who runs a security firm in L.A., it's called a huge bodyguard company.  A guy, Chris, runs a place.  And he basically says, he goes, listen, if the celebrities would just get some balls and say, we're not going to do this anymore, we're not going to cooperate, things would change.  He goes, but some of them need it so much that it's not going to go away.  Right, that's what it is.  It's become part of, you know, hey, we need that. 
[01:08:30]  It's become part of the machine.  And there's no guarantee that they're going to be celebrities forever, either.  That's right.  If they knew that, then they could easily all get together and go, all right, I'll do it.  I'll stop this.  I'll do it until 2015.  Right, right.  Yeah, then.  A lot of these people are just hanging on for dear life.  Yeah.  They're hot for a few years, and then they're done.  And they know that.  That's why they would never agree to something like that.  Of course.  Wow.  Is that the picture you took?  Which one is it?  Let me see it.  Oh, I didn't take that.  No, no, no, no.  That's pretty much for that.  That's her in her yoga, though.  No, that's her in her yoga outfit.  But, yeah, the one that Giles took was her coming out of, she's like next to her Mercedes. 
[01:09:00]  It looks more like this one, but that's not it.  Right.  Okay.  It's closer to that one.  Damn.  But look, that's a million of her just in yoga.  That's right.  And so that's what people do all the time.  Were you doing any sneaky telephoto shit?  Or did they always know you were there?  Climbing in the trees and stuff?  No, no, like I was hiding in the van as we found this guy, Jaiman Homsu, you know, the  guy from Amistad.  We saw him working out over on the Santa Monica steps.  We're like, oh, let's hang out here and we'll get a picture of him.  So I got photographs of him working out, which, you know.  Did you feel kind of creepy? 
[01:09:30]  You feel so creepy.  No, you feel so.  Yeah.  Well, because the big story we tried to chase, because this is like in the middle of like,  you know, Lamar Odom's kind of crack meltdown.  Right.  You know, they were like, you know, so that was if anybody can get a picture of Lamar  Odom right now, that's that was the that was the unicorn.  Like, if you can get the unicorn of him, then you've made it.  So we started going to all the places where he was.  And I'm like outside of like the alleged crack house in L.A. where he was, the hotel.  And you're just camping out and you're like, wow, I feel like a scumbag.  Right.  I feel like the dirtiest person right now because. 
[01:10:00]  And you're known yourself.  Yeah.  Exactly.  They're like scumbag.  And it's you.  Yeah.  I knew you were scumbag.  That's what they're saying.  Is there anything you didn't take a photo of?  Like you mean.  I don't know.  I didn't take a photo of a celebrity that I could actually sell.  Did you make the seven hundred fifty dollars?  I didn't.  I didn't.  We got the.  So we put my photos up online and then I was like, hey, we got some checks coming  and I'm going to send you the I'm going to send you the receipts.  Right.  And so they came.  I made like four dollars. 
[01:10:30]  That's not quite enough to live on.  What percentage did he take?  I made.  He said, I'm not taking anything.  It's four.  I made three like three dollars and eighty cents.  It was.  I didn't even make four dollars.  It was less.  Three dollars and eighty cents.  You know what you should just do?  Take pictures of other people's pictures in magazines and just sell them and hope nobody  saw it.  Exactly.  Nice.  Yeah.  Well, because there's so many photographers there.  So you're like, oh, that was my picture.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll draw a hat on him or something.  A little different.  Photoshop a fucking hat. 
[01:11:00]  Wow.  That's right.  I got to tell you, Inside Man, it's a good show, man.  Oh, thanks, man.  Congratulations on it.  Yeah.  Thank you.  What other topics are you hitting up this year?  Yeah.  So that's the first week.  Second week is, you know, we ask the question, like, can you live forever?  You know, now it's like people are getting older than ever and technology is helping us  live longer.  And so, you know, so the question was, like, what would it take to actually live forever?  And I go to see this doctor who puts me through this, this crazy barrage of tests and tells  me what's wrong with me and what I need to do.  And at that point, we just start using that as the jumping off point.  Wow.  Because today it's like you can, they're printing, they're printing organs now. 
[01:11:30]  So like, you know, if I keep drinking the way that I do at some point, I may need a new  liver.  And now I've stored my stem cells at a place in North Dakota where they can harvest your stem  cells and then put them in a vault.  Right.  And then if you need them, they have them.  Oh, wow.  And so now they can, like, print you new organs.  And we interviewed a doctor in North Carolina who, he's printing kidneys, he's printing  livers, he's printing hearts.  What do you mean by printing?  So it's like a 3D printer.  Right.  Like, we know that technology.  So how are they using it in the medical field?  And so what they're doing now is they're taking, they're taking, like, frames of your 
[01:12:00]  organs.  Right.  Basically the veins of the, so they have the vein framework.  And then upon that vein framework, they're taking your stem cells.  And they've done it now with animals.  They have yet to do it with a human being, but they've done it with multiple animals where  they build, just like they would anything else, your cells on this framework of veins  to create an organ.  Why is it so much harder to do it on humans?  I don't think it's, I don't think it's, a lot of this stuff, I don't think it's harder.  I think it's just liability.  I'm sure years ago they tried things on humans all the time. 
[01:12:30]  And people are like, I got a lawyer.  This is my lawyer.  Meet this guy.  I always feel like they have done it on humans, all this stuff, but they just can't come forward  with it.  Probably.  There's probably a lab somewhere.  We absolutely cloned a human.  Get the fuck out of here.  You think?  Absolutely.  I want one of those.  Wait, wait, how do they take your stem cells?  I would be so much more productive.  How do they get them?  What, clones?  Stem cells.  Stem cells.  They harvest them right out of your backside.  Oh.  So they basically dig down into your cells under like a certain layer, like underneath a couple 
[01:13:00]  layers of skin, and they pull them out.  So you could do that, and then why can't they just do that when you need them, or does it  take a while for them to multiply?  They can take them whenever you want.  So they can take them now, and you want them taken as young as possible, because as young  and as healthy as you can be.  Because like from now, so now I've got the healthiest stem cells of like a 43-year-old  man.  Right.  There you go.  And as you get older, then your cells will continue to age.  So now, if I'm 60 and I need them, I have the cells of a 43-year-old, which is better.  I wish I would have done that 30 years ago.  Yeah, right?  Exactly.  Well, I wish they would have known about it 30 years ago, really. 
[01:13:30]  That's a good point.  You're raising a good point.  Leaving your ice cube tray at home?  What?  I have to put other fluids and have a giz cube.  The aging doctors, what are they saying about life expectancy today?  Well, this is the amazing thing.  So we interviewed this guy.  There's this guy named Ray Kurzweil, who...  Oh, God, is he a bore.  But he's...  We love him, but he's a genius.  Of course he is.  But he's a genius.  He's like a ridiculous genius.  And so he's...  We had him on, and we liked him. 
[01:14:00]  But he's got this whole idea called the singularity.  Of course.  Which is when technology and biology will...  Come together.  ...will come together.  And they're predicting that to be 2045.  So the idea is you live as healthy as you can to 2045, and then every year beyond 2045,  that you can live biologically, technology will add another year.  So basically, you'll gain two for every one you can live, which is crazy to think about.  So the idea is just living as healthy as you can to that year, and then by that point,  you'll be able to just, you know, gain extra...  He says that, but I think his time frame is wishful thinking, because he says that's  how long it will take to map DNA. 
[01:14:30]  And once they map DNA, and they learn how to load your memory and stuff up to a hard  drive, there's a whole bunch of stuff.  I just...  Believe me, I think it will happen.  I just think that his time frame is off.  Yeah.  I hope he's right.  Well, we met a guy...  We already met a company in San Francisco called Cambrian Genomics, who they're already hacking DNA.  So, like, if you...  And not hacking DNA to where it'll cost billions of dollars, but where it'll cost thousands  of dollars, where they went into my DNA, and so I'm basically prone to type 2 diabetes.  And they said, here is the one piece of your chromosome strand that is off.  He goes, we could fix that tomorrow. 
[01:15:00]  Let's just take that out?  We could literally take that out and put in the correct piece, and it'd be fixed.  And I was like, that's...  No, I'm not going to do it.  Why?  Because it would cost a lot of money.  How much?  Thousands.  Thousands.  Well, thousands isn't bad to avoid diabetes.  It's not bad.  Yeah, but it's like...  Or you can just eat better.  DNA start replicating in that new DNA without the...  And then once you fix that strand, then it'll start...  Without the strand in it, so...  The show's on CNN.  Get your...  Get this fixed.  I know.  Come on.  Jeff Zucker.  You're making good money?  Jeff Zucker, take care of this for me.  How many thousands, though?  How many thousands? 
[01:15:30]  They didn't say.  They said that it would be...  They said it wouldn't be...  They said it would be expensive.  Like, right now, it's still cost-prohibitive for most people.  Then you wonder, like, all right, what else would that affect?  Yeah, exactly.  Suddenly, I'm like Quatto.  I'm like...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Suddenly, a head starts growing out of my stomach.  Right.  Well, what the...  You don't have diabetes, but every time you sneeze, your asshole falls out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's some tricky stuff.  Very tricky.  I mean, Mickey Rooney lived forever.  He was 93 and looked like shit for... 
[01:16:00]  Most of the whole time.  Well, that's the question.  It's like, do you want to live to be...  It's like, sure, you can live to be 150.  I was like, yeah, but what am I going to look like?  How am I going to be at 150?  That's the problem.  And how active are you going to even be?  That's right.  So I'm going to be like George Burns for 75 more years.  Yeah.  It's like, or am I going to be like this?  Yeah, because that's the...  I mean, the goal of the fountain of youth thing is to be able to live forever, but be  in a young, active body.  And look good.  Yeah.  Not just age like normally, but you stay alive. 
[01:16:30]  That's right.  That would just be horrible.  Or I'm just like...  I'm like the mom in Brazil who just keeps getting stretched just faster and faster.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My skin just keeps getting...  Much further and further across my face.  Living 75 extra years with not one girl interested in you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Why?  I live 45 that way.  But think how hot the robots will be then.  Then you can just have a sex robot.  That's true, too.  A little sex pot.  That's right.  That'd be nice.  Yeah, we got to think about what they're going to incorporate.  What other episodes? 
[01:17:00]  UFOs?  Yeah, we do an episode about UFOs.  Nice.  We're doing one about UFOs, which is great.  We're doing one about student athletes.  You know, like, should you pay student athletes?  Of course you should.  They make billions of dollars.  Billions of dollars.  I went and played football at Ole Miss as part of that episode where I just got my ass  beat by guys twice my size and like half my age.  And it was, it's a great episode, but I'm still, like, I still have no feeling in this  thumb from, like, getting hit by those guys.  You took real hits.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that a weird kind of a situation, though, when you start paying students? 
[01:17:30]  Well, it depends on what you pay.  Here's the thing is what I say is if you're going to pay them is, so they say they're going  to pay for their education.  It's like, well, what if they want to go to medical school?  What if they want to go to law school?  What if they want to get a master's, a PhD?  Are you going to pay for that?  Or are you only going to pay them while they're making millions for university?  Right.  You know, if they get hurt while they're in college, you know, one and a half percent  of these guys actually get to go to the NFL.  Yeah.  Is that it?  Wow.  One and a half of every player in college.  So these guys are making these universities so much money.  So much money.  And knowing they don't even have a chance to make the money after they leave college. 
[01:18:00]  And so now here are these guys who, one of the guys that we were with, had two ACL surgeries  already, had two knee surgeries.  Well, you know, the chances of that guy, I mean, he's a great player.  Will he get to go to the NFL?  Maybe.  Chances are more likely not.  But so as he has health problems later on in life, who's going to pay for that?  What's going to happen?  Is he have to have another surgery in four or five years?  Will the university take care of that?  Oh, these guys are broke.  I think now, no, they're done.  No, so the thing is, I feel like there's a way to, quote unquote, pay them or incentivize  them that isn't just giving them a check.  And they're not getting a real education.  A lot of these student athletes are, it's fake school. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, like North Carolina, the story that broke about those guys.  Oh, Jesus.  Where they weren't even going to class.  Yeah.  There was no class.  They were basically, they had to, quote unquote, write a paper that they went online.  I read one of those papers.  Holy jeez.  It was written in crayon.  It was really bad.  Yeah.  They're not going to the classroom whatsoever.  Yeah.  But then where do you draw the line?  Do you pay the cheerleaders?  Do you pay the, you know, the support crew?  The lacrosse team.  The lacrosse team is bringing in all the money.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it'd be easy to figure out how to divvy it up. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Percentage of the revenue generated by that sport.  Division I basketball is huge, obviously.  Division I badminton, not so much.  Not so much.  Baseball, no one cares about college.  But now, do you give all the players the same thing?  Or the star players make more?  Like, all of a sudden, now you're going to have agents coming in to negotiate deals for  these?  Maybe it's just a flat fee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because one of the guys we were with, he couldn't even, he was at the point where he couldn't  pay his phone bill.  Right.  And so it's like, if you can't get a loan, and you can't pay those types of bills, then 
[01:19:30]  what do you do?  And it's like, there's no time to get in there.  And people are saying, well, they should go get a job.  So, like, their full-time job is being football players.  And you know about the guys that are actually starving?  Oh, yeah.  You heard about that.  They can't even get food.  They can't even really get food because, you know, they're being watched so closely.  So, you know, they can't even give them food, or that's considered tampering with  the players.  That's right.  A benefit.  And a lot of these guys can't even fly home.  So you're watching these amazing, you know, college athletes, and then they don't even  go home for the holidays because that would be breaking the rules, too.  And they come from ridiculously, you know, poor places. 
[01:20:00]  So they stay at school.  They have no choice.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  But that's a great show.  That'll be a great episode.  The UFO one.  I saw part of that, too.  You went to meet these people.  What does this guy do?  Is it a technological advisor for something?  That tech advisor you went to see?  Well, there's a guy.  We went to see a guy.  There's an organization called MUFON, which basically, they are UFO investigators.  And it's like, I had no idea.  There are like thousands of MUFON investigators. 
[01:20:30]  MUFON.  MUFON.  The MUFON.  Mutual UFO Network.  That's right.  Mutual UFO Network.  Nice.  And so MUFON basically has all these people.  You have to go through a real training regime to do it, you know, to become a MUFON investigator.  And then you go, and when somebody sees something, they actually investigate everything.  They need a better name, though.  MUFON is not a good name for them.  It doesn't sound.  It doesn't ring out.  Yeah.  It sounds like move on.  It's like move on.  Or a terrible sex term.  I want to get my MUFON.  Boo. 
[01:21:00]  That's a weird thing that's happened in recent years, too, is the fact that cameras now just are everywhere.  Yeah.  Yet, you know, what would we consider legitimate proof of UFOs?  You know, the heyday was in the 60s and 50s.  Sketch artists.  But do we have any videos out there right now that they're really just baffled by still?  I don't know.  I mean, there's not any that are.  There's a guy that we met with whose whole job is to basically debunk everything. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  Who is like he's a MUFON investigator who rips apart photographs, rips apart video evidence.  And his whole thing is like, listen, I believe because I believe in all this.  He goes, but I have yet to see something that makes me that compels me enough to be like this is this is great evidence is great proof.  But once there are a couple of photos that they could like most of them, they figured out what was wrong, what they were natural occurrences.  But there were a few that they just couldn't debunk.  By now, they might be able to with computers hovering around.  If they have the technology to get to Earth, when they just wander around knowing that they can't fuck with them. 
[01:22:00]  Well, that's there was there was there's there's a couple people we interviewed in that show where you expect to like meet kooks like you expect to meet like some like you expect to be like an episode of cops.  Like here's a guy drunk with his shirt off going, I saw it over the field like that's who you expect.  But there were people that we interviewed for that show who had real sightings that they couldn't explain.  Right.  A woman.  There was a husband and wife who was a he's a musician.  She's a nurse and completely credible.  Like these were normal everyday people like living outside of Atlanta who they were like and they've had like three different sightings. 
[01:22:30]  Outside of their house.  And he's like, I can't explain it.  I don't know what it is.  He basically plays his guitar on the balcony and he thinks that that lures them.  I say he's a whack job.  But but his wife is completely normal.  Right.  But his wife is is a normal nurse.  And she says he yelled at me, came in and grabbed me.  And she goes, I couldn't explain what it was.  What were they saying?  Well, they had two different sightings.  One of them.  One of them.  They described this thing that looked almost like a glowing pink trash can turned upside down that was over their house that then started moving off into the. 
[01:23:00]  Distance over the over the over the trees.  That was the first one.  And then the second one was this giant.  It was huge.  Almost almost like boomerang shaped.  That was reflective.  So basically it was reflecting the sky and everything else that was in it.  But you actually physically see it moving through the sky above their house.  That was the second video video.  No video.  No video.  Well, because here's the thing.  So he started taking started taking photographs with his camera.  And as soon as he pulled his camera out, basically all the electronics in their entire house went out. 
[01:23:30]  Of course.  And the camera was fried.  Of course it is.  Yeah.  That's right.  Oh, man.  I believe, though.  I just, you know.  It's hard.  I believe.  I believe there's life all over the universe.  That's right.  And I believe.  We've got cameras, though.  I mean, there is one thing that isn't photographed now.  Right.  The second something happens on the streets, that everybody's got a camera over their head  and taking video and pictures, you would think one credible, amazing UFO flying saucer. 
[01:24:00]  It's all part.  It's all part of the government.  It's all part of cover-up, man.  Cover-up.  It's a big cover-up, man.  It's all part of the government.  You could believe what you want to believe.  I've seen the conspiracy.  Right.  Any of the UFO experts explain why they just hover around and are checking us out?  No, it's like, no, because the real experts, like the people who run SETI, like the Search  for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, like these people, the people who run that place are,  you know, these are real scientists who are out every day, and they're listening.  They're, like, searching the universe with, like, crazy, you know, telescopes, and they're 
[01:24:30]  like, listen, we have yet to find anything.  They're the laughingstocks of the scientific community, by the way.  Laughingstocks.  But they really are.  They're the fucking, you know, they're like the hack scientists, even though they're really  great scientists.  Like, oh, what are you looking for?  Yeah, that's cute.  What a spaceman, you dicks.  But how much of our galaxy can we listen to at this point?  Well, that's the whole thing.  They say that, as they, like, searching through the galaxy, they're like, imagine if you've,  imagine if you've, like, dipped a cup of water into the ocean. 
[01:25:00]  Like, that's what we've listened to.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, they're saying that we have so much more to even, like, start to explore.  Yeah, our galaxy is just one of whatever.  That's right.  It's nothing.  Millions or billions.  They don't even know at this point how many galaxies.  Oh, hundreds of billions.  Hundreds of billions.  Yeah, ridiculous.  So we're only listening to a tiny, tiny minuscule portion.  And at some point, it's going to be like when you're driving in a car and you finally find  that station, you're like, oh, there's that station.  Right.  Like, suddenly they're going to be like, oh, we should have been listening over here the  whole time.  Oh, fuck.  We missed that.  How do you get yourself into these jobs and situations? 
[01:25:30]  You approach these people.  Do they say, no, we don't.  Have you been turned down?  They're like, oh, there's that jackass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like using the, look at the school as an example.  When we were calling around saying we want to make an episode about student-athletes,  we called so many schools, schools that had a lot of violations, schools that have been,  and they're like, absolutely not.  We want nothing to do with this.  I mean, a lot of schools were very adamant.  Ohio State, you know, a ton of them were like, no way we're letting you film here and do  this.  What about Penn State?  Oh, there you go. 
[01:26:00]  Going to the showers.  Happy Valley.  Happy Valley.  I think they're a little gun shy of having people in there.  Poking around.  What happened there with that guy?  Oh, no.  What happened, Jim?  One of the assistant coaches had a whole, yeah, he was a big snitch.  I guess they were hiding this story, huh?  The media didn't want to.  Yeah, that's so weird.  Yeah, this McQuarrie guy.  What a terrible guy.  Tattletale.  Tattletale.  Let Morgan work the showers for us.  Come on in, boys.  They don't call me inside man for nothing.  Someone's got a thought on the lights. 
[01:26:30]  The lights.  This guy has seen the lights, too.  Jack in Jacksonville.  Go ahead.  Is he?  All right.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Morgan.  Great.  I love your stuff, man.  Oh, thanks, man.  Listen, about that one object you referred to, that boomerang-shaped one, that's a real  common thing.  That was the subject of the Phoenix lights, and that's something I've seen myself.  Well, it's clearly a man-made thing, though, you know what I mean?  But I wonder, what do you think about that?  Why is it that nobody seems to be able to figure out what it is, but we see it all the 
[01:27:00]  time?  I mean, that's a great question.  That's one of the things we ask about is, you know, some people say, well, it's got to  be some sort of, maybe it's a government shit, maybe it's something that we're testing and  it just hasn't come out, and it's like, maybe.  I mean, who knows?  I mean, I feel like...  It's like a floating object.  It sort of, it seemed like it was helium-filled and had lights on the side of it.  And then when I saw that documentary, Phoenix Lights, everybody was making a big deal about  it.  I'm like, I saw that fucking thing in South Carolina in the 90s.  What was it, Phoenix Lights?  Yeah, so did they say what it was?  Did they come up with an idea in the show? 
[01:27:30]  No, no.  Do you remember a couple years ago that we were seen over Phoenix and millions of people  called in the Air Force?  And that's all it was.  It just floats there.  It's helium-filled or...  Or alien-filled.  Ah, you never know.  You never know.  Hydrogen.  And it's got blinking lights.  And it seemed, when I saw it, it came over to treetops, and then it realized, oh, shit.  It's like, uh-oh, we're in the open.  And then the lights started blinking on, off, on, off, and then off completely.  But you still see it there in the air floating. 
[01:28:00]  Did it make any sound?  It's huge.  Were you probed slightly?  Yeah, a little probage.  No sound, though?  It didn't make a sound?  No, it was like a very small hum, almost like there was an outboard motor and a fan.  It's man-made.  It's man-made.  It's like special ops or somebody.  I mean, that's what I can't understand.  And it was in the 90s, so I didn't have a...  Oh, yeah.  Not everyone didn't have their cameras.  Nobody had a camera back then.  I think in the 50s and 60s, when there were so many sightings and stuff, I think that was 
[01:28:30]  a lot of Russian and American technology that we were kind of trying to hash out.  Yeah.  I think before computers, there was a lot of trial and error going on.  It was like you couldn't virtually fly something in a computer or in a smaller scale, so that  you actually built this goddamn thing, sent it up, and whatever happened, happened.  And that's some of the old UFOs.  Yeah, the prototypes.  People are like, aliens!  That's what I think.  There's an alien!  Yeah.  How weird.  You just had a paparazzi shot.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  Talks coming in right now.  See?  We only have five minutes left, and there's a few more calls I want in.  Thank you, Jack.  Let me go to Kevin in Philly.  Kevin, go ahead.  Kevin?  Morgan Spurlock in studio, Inside Man on CNN.  It's Sundays, right?  Sundays at 10.  Yeah, it premieres this Sunday, 13.  Great.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Hey, boys.  I'm going to get ribbed for this, but Morgan, I saw your One Direction movie. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, yeah, you did.  I've seen it like five times, and it's fantastic.  Oh, well, thank you very much.  What One Direction movie?  I directed a film last year about One Direction called One Direction, This Is Us.  You actually directed that?  I did, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  You directed that?  I did.  How do we not know that?  I know.  We've known you forever.  I know.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, no, I got called.  This is a funny story, because I got called years ago when we were finishing a film.  I just started doing Greatest Movie Ever Sold.  Right.  And while we were doing that, I got called by Paramount, and they said,  we'd love you to come in and meet with us about this Justin Bieber film. 
[01:30:00]  And I was like, I'm in the middle of this other movie.  There's no way I can chase that massive film right now.  And then when we were finishing both the Comic-Con and Manson films,  because we were finishing those simultaneously,  Paramount called again and said, we've got this Katy Perry movie.  And at that point, and I was like, God, you've got to be kidding me.  I said, this is the second time.  And that one, you were inheriting somebody's headache.  It had all already been shot.  And they're like, put this movie together.  Take this footage and make it.  And I was like, is that the one that came out last year?  That's the one that came out.  I saw it.  It was a disaster.  Yeah.  I mean, it's, you know, it's where it's, it just, it just, 
[01:30:30]  I feel like that the 3D didn't pop off the screen.  I feel like a lot of it felt very kind of like, you know, candy coated.  And then, and then when I got called for this, they said,  have you ever heard of this band One Direction?  I was like, of course I have.  And, and so I was like, this is the third time when you,  when you make docs to get the chance to make a film of that scope and that size.  I mean, it never happens.  It rarely happens.  And like, this is the third time I got called.  And so I threw my hat in the ring.  I had to go do this and I got the job and it was amazing.  Yeah.  So we got to make this crazy, you know, 3D, $10 million movie.  How are they?  They're good.  They're actually good kids. 
[01:31:00]  You know, these are kids who realize that they have been incredibly fortunate and really  lucky.  And now here they are.  They're about to go on a big stadium tour this year.  I mean, so last year they were, when we were filming them, it was all arenas.  This year they're doing all stadiums.  They're going to be like giant stadium, Gillette.  Wow.  You know, the Chicago.  I mean, it's going to be massive.  Screaming girls.  Rose Bowl.  They're doing three nights at the Rose Bowl.  So like, it sounds like a hundred plus thousand 300,000 people in three days.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's nuts.  So yeah.  So that, but I'm glad you liked it. 
[01:31:30]  No, I enjoyed making that film and I think the film came out fantastic.  I'm really proud.  How do you know where to put the camera, Morgan?  I just, it baffles me.  Directing.  Was it screaming girls everywhere you guys went?  Everywhere we went.  We were filming in Mexico City and the whole time we were in Mexico City at the hotel, 5,000  girls camped outside the hotel every day for five days, just yelling, screaming, singing.  I mean, it was bananas.  Wow, man.  And that's like those guys' life every day.  Are those guys married? 
[01:32:00]  None of them.  One of them's about to get married.  He got engaged last year.  Yeah.  Got engaged.  What a dummy.  Don't tell me.  There's plenty of time to get married.  Yeah.  What is he, 20 something?  20, like 2021.  What is he doing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just got Zane.  Zane got married.  Wow.  They got engaged.  Yeah.  So there's the trailer.  I do enjoy a good documentary.  Like, I wish there were more quality ones.  Yeah.  What have you seen recently that you liked?  Oh, gosh.  I've been into these goddamn air disaster documentaries. 
[01:32:30]  It seems like that's all that's on TV right now.  I know.  I know.  But I saw the one about the PSA flight that went down in San Diego back in the late 80s.  And they came back for the 30th anniversary and had interviews with the people.  And that was pretty compelling.  But it could have been better.  Yeah.  And I wanted it to kind of be better, you know?  Yeah.  I liked the sushi documentary.  Oh, Juro Dreams of Sushi.  Juro Dreams of Sushi is a great film.  It's a documentary about anything.  Did you do that?  I didn't make that one. 
[01:33:00]  I didn't like that one.  Boy, which one was it?  But it's a beautiful film.  Juro Dreams of Sushi.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a beautiful film, though.  Yeah.  It's really beautiful.  And I loved...  But why wouldn't he open up a bigger place?  Because he could make a gajillion dollars in that tiny little place.  How, though?  There's only 10 seats or something.  But I think he charges a dumb amount of money per seat to sit there.  I think it's something crazy.  The Guccione one was good, too.  I liked the Bob Guccione doc.  Yeah, yeah.  Doc.  And the Hugh Hefner one.  Yeah.  What about Act of Killing?  Did you guys see that?  Oh, I didn't see that one yet.  That's weird.  That's bizarre.  Well, it's amazing.  So there were all of these people who... 
[01:33:30]  There were these guys in Indonesia that killed communists during the communist uprising in  the 60s.  And none of these people were ever prosecuted because they were basically doing the government's  work.  And so there were these guys that were hired killers.  And they killed like a million people, you know, that were communists.  And so the film is about this guy who goes back and finds these guys who killed  people who were murderers for the government.  And he starts interviewing them about killing all these people.  And not only just interviewing them in a normal way, he basically says, we want to tell your  story.  We want you to write this story of what you did.  And so these guys write a script and then they act out killing these people. 
[01:34:00]  And so they add.  So basically, they're basically before they're acting as themselves and acting as the people  they're murdering as they're filming it.  So they're turning it in almost like this play is this.  So it becomes like this film in a film.  And it's brilliant and crazy.  So bizarre.  So bad shit crazy.  But the film is it's really well done.  What's the best documentary you've ever seen?  The best documentary I've ever seen.  Well, there's two there's two there's two trains of thought like there's docs that I  give to people like the best doc.  My favorite doc of all time is a movie called Brothers Keeper that were done by did by Joe 
[01:34:30]  Berlinger and Bruce Anosky, the guys who did Metallica, some kind of monster in Paradise  Lost, which is about these three creepy brothers who live in upstate New York.  And one of them was found dead one day.  And so then they they basically accused the other one of murder.  And it turns into this like weird, creepy story of like incest.  And it gets dark.  Wow.  It gets so dark.  It gets dark.  I saw part of that years ago on video.  I never saw the end of it for some reason.  Now you make me want to go back and watch it.  Maybe you came already. 
[01:35:00]  Before the word incest, half of incest got when I was finished.  But then there's docs.  But then people always say like, what's a good doc?  What should I watch?  And then there's like gateway docs that I give to people.  Because you're like, docs are boring.  I don't want to watch them.  And then I give them like Anvil Story of Vanville.  Or American Movie.  Heavy Metal Parking Lot.  Hands on a Hard Body.  Heavy Metal Parking Lot.  Parking lot was fun.  Yeah, yeah.  Those are good.  Those are like great docs.  The King of Kong.  King of Kong.  It's one of the best ever.  Yeah.  That's a great gateway doc.  A lot of great characters in that one. 
[01:35:30]  That's right.  Steve Weeby.  Steve Weeby.  Super Size Me.  That's a good gateway doc.  That's a good gateway doc right there.  That's a great film, obviously.  Before you go, because I hear you only have like a minute left.  Robert, well, let him talk.  Robert in Birmingham, it looks like.  Yeah, Birmingham.  Go ahead, Robert.  Yeah, I want to call BS on the student athletes that were starving.  Unless it's a real lower tier school, maybe, that you were talking about.  I know at Alabama, they have 24-hour access to healthy snacks, fresh fruit, all that down in their student center. 
[01:36:00]  They get the best tutoring, tutoring that nobody on campus could afford.  So the question is, if you're going to get paid, if you decide that they're employees, don't they owe taxes on the about $200,000 value of the room and board and education that they get over the four years?  That's a great question.  But you know a lot of those guys aren't going to school for the education.  They're going there because it's, you know, it's the step to get into the pros. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, and especially if you're like, you're in the SEC.  I mean, you're going to Alabama.  I mean, you're going there to play Tier 1 football.  Right.  The SEC is like the best football in the United States.  And the tutors are just to get you a passing grade, but you're not, I wonder if you're actually soaking in any of that knowledge in the end.  We had a Rhodes Scholar four years ago.  I'm sure you have some of those people, but it's not the majority.  But that's like one every four years.  That's what happens at most schools.  It's available.  You can't, I mean, most of those guys couldn't write their names when they showed up in college. 
[01:37:00]  There's a limited amount of what you can do with them.  Yeah, I mean, that's a...  Well, that's our point.  Why are they in college then?  Exactly.  They're in college because they're hoping to get into the pros.  Yeah, and there are a lot of guys who are coming in.  And it's a good life for four or five years as they're doing it.  It's a trade school, and you don't get paid while you're in trade school.  And I guess the starving thing maybe is a slight exaggeration, but I guess...  Oh, but there are probably universities that are in Alabama, though, where that happens.  Yeah, and it's just harder to get food and stuff. 
[01:37:30]  You know, you'll do what you can to get your food.  And the trade schools aren't making $50 million on TV deals.  There's a lot more money being made than this.  Morgan's got to go, big time.  We're over the time.  Thank you, Robert.  And thank you to you guys.  I was actually talking about this in the hallway.  It has been now 14 years that I have...  That you guys have been there and supporting me.  We were there before anyone knew who you were.  Before anyone, before anybody.  That MTV show.  I was literally talking about this in the hallway, so I just want to say thank you.  She's got the name of the show. 
[01:38:00]  I bet you will.  I bet you will.  I bet you will.  We're at A&W, and a young Morgan Spurlock walks in.  A young, fresh-faced kid in the business.  And then he left, and we're like, ah, he'll never make it.  Exactly.  14 years later, he's still doing it.  Morgan Spurlock, Inside Man, this Sunday, it premieres season 2, 10 p.m. on CNN.

[01:47:30]  Yeah, he's a good egg.  That's for sure.  Yeah, that was fun.  Ah.  Biggest story of the day.  Ooh.  Let me think.  Biggest story of the day.  My Tampa shows this weekend.  Ah, that's a big story.  Right.  No?  I would say The Immortal.  Does it start with The Immortal?  No. 
[01:48:00]  Obviously not.  Yes, it doesn't.  I hope not.  Mickey Rooney?  No.  Mickey Rooney being dead is a big one.  Not as big as this story.  John Panette died?  No.  Oh.  That sucks, though.  He's a nice guy, man.  You comedians love dying early.  Well, like I said before, comedians either live to be 90 or they're dead before they're  50.  It's a very weird...  You know, because I think comics live one of two lifestyles.  Either you live a very healthy lifestyle and you get all the aggression out. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, right.  And it's like beating cancer all the time because you're just constantly venting about what you  don't like.  So, you know, guys like Henny Youngman and Bob Hope and fucking George Burns.  Or, you know, the unhealthy lifestyle gets you going, unfortunately.  Well, he was kind of chubby.  Yeah, but he lost the weight.  He went, I think, for surgery and then someone said it was...  This picture.  He had some other things going on.  Yeah, but that picture is deceiving because I'm thinner than that. 
[01:49:00]  I'm wearing a hoodie, though.  Yeah.  Giving me an extra pound or two.  Yeah.  What?  I'm putting all this mush back together.  What is that, Instagram or Twitter?  That's our Twitter.  O&A show on Twitter.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  That's all right.  I apologize.  That picture just popped up in the middle of that.  Go ahead.  It's a shame that he's dead.  I didn't know him well.  He's a nice guy.  He's a sweet guy, man.  I ran into him a few times over the years. 
[01:49:30]  Real nice guy.  I never met him.  I don't think we ever had him on the show for whatever reason.  I did Montreal with him.  We had spoken earlier.  What a great guy.  Not a great crowd.  I was on the show.  Anthony Clark was on the show.  I don't remember who else was.  But I remember none of us were doing great.  We were all doing okay.  And then Panette went on and fucking murdered.  Yeah.  And he was just so funny.  I'm watching him.  And he's doing this bit on gluten.  And I'm like, God, who the fuck closes with a bit on gluten? 
[01:50:00]  Gluten!  And he was really a funny guy.  Yeah.  He was a great comic.  Did a lot of self-deprecating fat guy jokes, right?  I don't know exactly what killed him.  I guess they're finding out.  Was it?  Found him in a hotel in Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh, yeah.  You'd never want to read that about yourself.  That's right.  I thought you went to Pittsburgh to make your life seem longer.  To make it seem like you're living a long, long time.  John Panette actually did.  That's the best thing that can happen in Pittsburgh.  You don't have to deal with it anymore.  Yeah.  Oh, shit. 
[01:50:30]  But I love you, Pittsburgh.  His heart or his...  He had some issues, huh?  Yeah, man.  He had some health issues.  We've heard him over the years.  Yeah.  He lost a lot.  I think he got the surgery.  He did get the surgery.  Oh, he did.  He got the lap thing.  Oh, a long time ago.  But I think he might have went back to his ways or something.  Yeah, and he had a reputation for drinking and they said it was kind of hard for him  to get through shows sometimes.  He said he had heart.  Oh, wow.  Pulmonary embolism.  Pulmonary embolism.  But they don't know that yet.  That's too soon for them to know. 
[01:51:00]  That's what his manager or agent said.  He was the guy who got mugged at the end of the last Seinfeld, I guess?  Yeah, the last Seinfeld.  He was the guy that got mugged and they just videoed him.  They didn't help.  That's a good copy of the clip, right?  I'd see him better.  First class doesn't make it anymore.  Well, we can't.  There is.  Yeah.  The audio is really bad.  And they, I...  There he is.  Of course, the mugger.  Ah, that's a shame. 
[01:51:30]  Who's the mugger?  I don't know.  Just making an observation?  Oh, of course.  All right, boy.  That's hardest.  That's a shame.  Yeah.  He was only 50.  Yeah.  I am.  50 years old.  I'm 50 years old.  Was Mickey Rooney married to Judy Garland?  I don't know why they...  I looked him up and they said, I see Judy Garland, but he just... 
[01:52:00]  He was married eight times.  I think he was married to Ava Godner for a year.  You want to see how fucking...  I Twittered my photo of Mickey Rooney scolding me for being a dirty comedian?  Yes.  That was only a year ago, right?  No, no.  It was probably two or three years ago.  Already?  Yeah.  But I got a picture with him and his wife, and I didn't want one with his fucking wife.  I wanted one with him.  Your fucking wife.  But she jumps in, and I wanted to say, like, what are you doing, lady?  Right.  But I couldn't yell at a guy's wife.  Wow, is he fucking giving you the old what have you? 
[01:52:30]  Was he joking about scolding you?  I don't know, but look at me and his fucking monstrous wife.  Oh, boo.  He's hiding like a child between us.  There's no way to Photoshop.  Why are you in this picture?  You can't shop that out.  She's famous for marrying Mickey Rooney.  No, she did movies with him and stuff, but I can't fucking Photoshop her out.  Her big, fat fucking head.  What is she doing in this picture?  What a fucking...  Oh, get out.  Oh, my God.  Look at this giant he was married to.  Wow.  Probably like to get smothered a little bit. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Big, big butt in his face smothering him.  Oh, Jesus.  93.  I have good teeth.  Yeah, big old Bill.  And then he kicked me in the guts.  Yeah, Bill.  Why are they talking about the movie Bill?  They should.  Instead of all those other films he was in.  Those crappy fucking Judy Garland movies.  I got you this job at the country club to keep you out of trouble, remember?  I won't be in any trouble, Miss King. 
[01:53:30]  Everything's all right.  Now I won't get picked by the cops more.  Everything's onky dory.  And the television, I bought that so you can stay out of trouble, too.  Television.  Oh, boy.  That's...  I dream of Jeannie.  That's a cutie.  Oh, is that fucking embarrassing to watch?  You think that's embarrassing?  Yeah, really embarrassing.  I'll be all right now.  Old Bill's gonna be fine.  Merry Christmas.  Ho, ho, ho.  He went full retard.  Bill. 
[01:54:00]  What?  That's my name.  William.  Bill for short.  Oh, hi, Bill.  I'm Barry.  Hi, Perry.  No, Barry.  Perry for short.  Yeah.  Oh, you dummy.  Exactly.  Well, where's Tara, my sister?  She lives on Florida Street.  And it's like, no, she went to Florida, you dummy.  What happened to your face?  I was downtown, and this guy come up to me.  He said, buddy, you didn't know my name.  And I said, yes. 
[01:54:30]  He said, you want to go have a beer with me?  I said, sure, buddy, I'll have a beer with you.  And then he said, how would you like for me to knock your teeth out?  I said, mine ain't very good anyway.  Fucking home run, Bill.  Cocksucker.  All you have to do is just sit there and tell me about yourself, and I'm just going to sit  right over here and ask you some questions, and that's all there is to it, okay?  Make a documentary.  That's all there is.  You ready?  All right. 
[01:55:00]  Let's start with an easy one, okay?  How old are you, Bill?  33, 46, 58.  I'm a real spring chicken.  Bill.  Oh, are you?  You don't like that?  Oh, it's terrible.  I got in an argument with my girlfriend at the time when this movie came out.  It was a TV movie, and we watched it, and she was crying.  Yeah, 81.  She was crying, and I was laughing, and she started punching me because I was laughing at Bill. 
[01:55:30]  He was 60 when he made that movie.  Hmm?  I think it's 1981.  Yeah, huh?  33 years, I guess, right?  So 60.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he was 60 when he made that?  Jesus.  You know what this is?  It's a microphone.  A cock.  It's a microphone, right?  Or mic for short.  Mic for short.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Where have you been, Billy boy? 
[01:56:00]  Billy boy.  Where have you been, darling Billy?  I've been down to the farm.  Didn't do no harm.  Can you make a cherry pie, darling Billy?  You don't like this song?  No.  Not at all.  Oh, and then he plays the harmonica.  Wow, Bill.  Oh.  It's a good song.  Yeah, where have you been, Billy boy? 
[01:56:30]  At the tarred house.  Where do you think he's been?  Exactly.  Did you notice have your paint chips were missing?  And here's a full tummy?  I didn't do no harm, and I didn't do no harm.  And you make a cherry pie, and I accidentally smothered nine animals.  I sat on a bunch of baby chicks.  My fat dumbass.  Jesus. 
[01:57:00]  Where have you been, Billy boy?  Billy boy.  Yeah.  They killed one guy.  He was having a fit.  They knocked him down the stairs.  They killed him.  I went to the guy in charge, and I said, hey, this kid is having a fit.  And he said to me, Bill, don't you bother me while I'm resting.  And he kicked me in the guts. 
[01:57:30]  He kicked him in the middle of the director?  Shut up.  Was he pitching a fit?  Yeah.  He didn't like the insane asylum.  See, Bill was a normal kid.  He was just like, he had some kind of small problem.  Right.  And then his parents, because it was that time, just threw him in an insane asylum.  And he grew up with all retarded people around him, so he became kind of retarded.  And then Dennis Quaid makes a documentary about him. 
[01:58:00]  Why'd they sing a song?  I don't know.  Remember when we talked to Dennis Quaid only about this movie?  Only about that.  We had Dennis Quaid on.  He was pitching one of his movies.  I don't know.  I don't know what it was when he was in.  He was cool, right?  He was great.  And I just kept going, oh boy, chicken.  He just laughed his ass off.  He was like, holy shit, he was shaking his head like, you motherfucker.  And then it got to the point where he basically was saying, enough, okay, I get it.  Oh, Bill.  But we wouldn't let it go.  Barry.  And then, of course, the famous scene, the chicken scene. 
[01:58:30]  Yes, the chicken scene.  We've got to play this one more clip.  One more clip.  I guess Barry thought it would be a good idea to bring Bill to his parents' house.  Oh, where was his parents' house?  It was in some hoity-toity fucking Connecticut.  There you go.  It was in Connecticut.  Yeah, and they're wealthy and have no time for a retard like Bill.  And they were making chicken.  And Bill just makes an ass of himself.  Oh, it's Dennis Quaid's family?  Yeah.  Oh, and he eats all the chicken.  Oh, he gets his hands all over every piece. 
[01:59:00]  Those Quaid's parents were just dicks to Bill.  You know he's just got his hand down the back of his, scratching his asshole and his dick  and balls.  And then he just holds your chicken.  Darling, Billy has a roid the size of a man's.  Yeah.  He's been fucking digging that.  His yam-sized roid.  He's grabbing a chicken.  Right before he grabs a handful of chicken.  Yeah, he's fucking itching his scalp and fucking knuckle-beeping his asshole.  He didn't know you'd just take one fucking piece.  Yeah, you know.  He's an idiot. 
[01:59:30]  He learned the hard way, but here's a quick part of that scene.  Are you good and hungry?  I hope you are.  I'm good and hungry.  I like it.  It's good.  Are you a company?  I'm the president of one.  Oh, goody.  Green bean.  They're good for you.  I like green bean.  Oh.  Here, have a lot.  You've got plenty.  I like plenty.  Plenty.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And some sweet potatoes.  Thirty.  He means one.  Oh, look at that chicken. 
[02:00:00]  Isn't that good?  He just keeps grabbing the chicken.  Isn't that good chicken?  Go easy on that.  It's good chicken.  Bill.  Bill is on a diet.  He's watching his weight because of his leg.  Isn't that right, Bill?  I'm not watching my weight now.  Bill, put that back.  I'm going to have more chicken.  Put that back.  I want to have more chicken.  Bill, put that back.  He keeps grabbing it.  Yeah.  Stand his hand.  Uh-oh.  He yelled at him. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, no.  Where'd Bill go?  Bill ran to the corner in the kitchen.  Ew.  He went to the corner.  Did he?  To stand there as his parents go, what the fuck is this?  You bring this over my house?  He's fucking wrecking all the chicken.  He's fucking standing in the corner.  They weren't too tolerant with Bill and his chicken.  His dumb chicken.  They weren't more tolerant.  They should have told him to fucking push something outside a warehouse and made a medal.  Oh, but his bad toupee, remember?  Yeah, he had his bad toupee on.  Oh, my God.  That's great, that hairdo. 
[02:01:00]  His toupee.  Yes.  Well, Bill.  Do you know about that media position yet?  No, I only have...  He has a sister?  Yeah, she's the wife.  Give her a good stiff fuck.  She was cute.  She was in a few movies.  Yeah.  Computer work.  I had some friends, at least I'm used to.  His dumb hairdo.  Bill's social hair.  Yeah.  The father's trying to get his kid into a good...  You might have changed your mind about this.  It's a good business.  Yes, he...  We don't want to change his mind.  We want to do a movie show called The Bill Show.  Why don't you shut up, retard?  Exactly.  We don't like your fucking dumb Moe Howard hairdo. 
[02:01:30]  Fuck off.  Yeah, that's how we met.  Oh, boy.  We're buddies now, and I got some new teeth.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  Shut up.  The father's like, oh, wait how tiny the table is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you going to have natural childbirth or that new French method, everyone?  Oh, how about the Greek method where they pull it out of your ass?  Oh, you mean the Le Boyer method?  She's beautiful.  Yes.  I wonder what happened to her.  They're good for you.  Oh, look.  Here comes Greedy Bill.  Yeah.  That shitty wig. 
[02:02:00]  There it is.  I like green beans.  I like green beans.  Greedy.  Oh.  Look at the...  They get horrified.  He means one.  See?  He means two or three.  What, does he have an ulcer on his leg?  I think he's got an ulcer on his leg.  Have you two known each other very long?  Oh, about four months.  Isn't that right, Bill?  We've been buddies for a long time.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Here comes the chicken thief.  That chicken isn't that good.  And he uses the fork, but then he takes his hands. 
[02:02:30]  That good chicken.  Take a wheezy on that.  Bill, that's three pieces.  It's good chicken.  Hey!  He's touching it.  Bill lives on a diet.  Why don't they just move the chicken?  Right?  Stop hovering the chicken by him.  The dumb fucking maid moves the goddamn chicken platter.  Exactly.  Don't you have fucking filthy hands off the chicken?  That's filmed horribly.  It really is.  No one would hold the tray in front of that.  Oh, no.  That guy.  Why is she still holding it there?  She's a buyer. 
[02:03:00]  Bill's a terrible runner.  Waddling idiot.  And then he runs into a corner.  Oh.  With his dumb wig.  Did people really feel sad when this happened?  Yes.  I rejoiced.  I swear, my girlfriend at the time was crying.  And I was doing that shaking because I'm laughing so hard.  He just got too excited.  He's like a little child.  Exactly.  Shut up.  They're in fingers, Heidi.  They're going to have a baby.  Bill fucking suffocates it.  I didn't do no harm.  I just suffocated your baby, darling. 
[02:03:30]  Really?  Where have you been, darling Billy?  They say that when they see bloody footprints walking away from the crib.  That goes on and on.  So there you go.  Mickey Rooney is no longer with us.  Everyone else is focusing on the wrong movies today.  Exactly.  Bill.  That's Mickey Rooney's legacy.  Oh, yeah.  Who's that girl?  Where'd she end up going?  Dennis Quaid.  Largo Woodruff. 
[02:04:00]  Largo.  That's her name?  She was a beautiful girl.  She was really hot in the day.  Yeah.  What does her Wikipedia say, though?  Where'd she go?  She didn't do anything.  She does not look good now, I bet.  This is her?  This is her page?  Yeah.  Nothing else?  Nothing, huh?  Where's this bitch?  Man.  Where'd this bitch?  Yeah, where's this bitch?  Why'd she go with this bitch?  She don't even have a wiki.  Oh, God.  Wow.  That's fucking tragic.  Oh, no.  What other movies did she do after Bill? 
[02:04:30]  The Fun House?  The Fun House.  Bill Part 2.  Yeah.  Yes, there is a Bill Part 2.  Who was in it?  I think they were all still in it again.  Really?  No, Helen Hunt was in it.  Bill on his own, it was called.  Was it Helen Hunt?  Helen Hunt was in on the second one.  She's great in Twister.  What do you think happens, and what happened with Part 2?  Did he get divorced from this lady and Helen Hunt signed on?  He got, well, at the end of...  Largo's in this one, too.  At the end of Bill, I know at the end of Bill, Perry, or Barry, whatever his name is, 
[02:05:00]  tells him he's got to move.  He's like, we're going to be moving, Bill.  And Bill is like, oh, I got to, you know, he's got to make it up by himself.  So he gets a job making coffee at the college.  Right.  And then Bill on his own, as he opens Wild Bill's Coffee Shop at the college.  Ew.  A business owner?  And now he's dealing with the students, and the students are all like, oh, hi, Bill.  And they're all nice to him.  That would never happen.  Kicking him in the ass and putting on the dope stickers on his back.  Is that her?  I'm a dope sticker. 
[02:05:30]  Jesus.  You know kids.  I love how you end it with, you know kids.  Is that her?  She don't look good anymore.  Yeah, she looks all right.  Well, she looks all right, but...  She's all right.  That's her now?  Yeah, but...  She looks pretty good for 30 years later.  30, yeah, so many years later.  Really, yeah.  Wow, what happened?  Was she married?  I want to give her a smooch.  The Funhouse.  God is watching.  I'm a dope sticker on his back. 
[02:06:00]  Fuck.  All right.  Darling Billy.  Darling Billy.  So, ah, yes.  Godspeed.  Five foot two.  My God.  He was a short little fucker, wasn't he?  Eight fucking wives, man.  He started his show business in 1921.  20?  He was born in 1920, so I guess he was a toddler.  He was 17 months old, yeah.  Little toddler.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a long time.  I think his breakout film was in 19, like, 35. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, my God.  Did all those fucking...  Crazy.  Little vaudeville movies.  What a fucking life, man.  What, uh...  And then he testified in front of Congress about elder abuse.  Yeah.  Because he was being abused.  I guess it was his stepson and his wife, allegedly.  Did they kick him in the guts?  He was throwing a fit.  What year did he testify?  It was 2011.  It says he was financially abused by unnamed family members. 
[02:07:00]  I think it was before 2011, though.  He was...  Financially abused.  No, I think there was elder abuse.  Like, he was being hit or something.  Right.  I don't know.  Where have you been, darling Billy?  Smack him.  Exactly.  How do you not know where he's been?  There's a fucking trail of gunk behind him.  Footprints.  Candy.  Oh, it was a stepson.  Ah, the stepson's fucking with him.  Yeah.  Oh, here it is.  The headline every week for families across America, making decisions how to care for aging parents. 
[02:07:30]  That's the way to do it.  The children get caught in the emotions.  Just give them the old sock-a-roo.  But there is help.  Iced them right in the eye.  For 50 years, J.R. Gardner was a pillar of strength to his six children.  Good for him.  Dad would call every child, every weekend, every Saturday.  Stop saying every.  Pillar of burden.  Oh, boy.  You don't look good.  He suffered a debilitating stroke.  Oh, boy.  That pillar now needed his children's strength. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, his hat.  Turned upside down July 5th.  Mm-hmm.  Suddenly, another blow.  Their 82-year-old mom, Virginia, was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Jesus Christ.  And then I had to go to the radiologist this afternoon.  Oh, nice conversations to have.  It was a tidal wave the brothers and sisters never saw coming.  We were going 90 miles an hour.  Amy and Anna are in California taking care of Dad.  JP and I are checking out facilities in Atlanta.  Had to stir the sauce.  We'll call Mississippi, try to touch base.  Gotta get over to take these guns.  Oh, Jimmy.  Lois won't get chemo without her head.  They got their dad settled in an assisted living facility near them in Atlanta. 
[02:08:30]  You can't do it in the room, man.  Yet Amy, Beth, and JP were caught in a crushing cycle.  We clashed.  And it was...  What is this story?  I thought it was...  I thought they were hitting...  Actor Mickey Rooney.  Right.  Where's the Mickey Rooney bar?  Ranking court protection from stepkids and then this video plays.  Right.  Oh.  It's not even about it.  It's not about Mickey Rooney.  At all.  Did they beat him up or something?  They punch his old hat off?  What happened?  I don't know.  They fucking...  They practiced judo on his hat? 
[02:09:00]  While he's wearing it?  Stand there, pops.  I'm going to fucking throw it.  I can't get your head.  I want to see.  Oh, well.  All right.  Enough about Mickey Rooney.  Fuck Mickey Rooney.  Love to.  Tried to.  He did all right.  Fucking wife just jumped in and hogged the whole...  Did you open up the fucking picture?  See, look at that fucking photo.  I just...  She really did jump right in.  His wife hogs the whole fucking picture.  Fucking bitch.  Look at the Cloverfield monster just attacking me and Mickey Rooney.  Look, yes.  Look at her.  What is she doing?  She wrecked the picture. 
[02:09:30]  She ruined it.  Who wants her?  She's covering up the guy that you wanted the picture with.  Yeah, big fat scarf.  I read on Wikipedia they got separated in May of 2013.  Oh, boy.  Good.  What?  He's 92 at that point.  God, why'd that fucking...  Why did they get separated?  I don't know.  She probably ruined too many photos because her son is the one that he was accusing of beating  the shit out of them.  Your son.  They hadn't lived together since last April.  Attempting to crack Mickey in the head. 
[02:10:00]  She found out he died through TMNT.  Oh, yeah?  Oh.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  That's horrible.  Wow.  Fucking bitch.  Right?  Fucking ruined my photo.  Ruined your picture.  A kid's fucking...  What's he giving the old fucking...  The old one-two to Mickey?  What a rotten family.  It really is.  For wrecking my photo.  Right.  That's worse than what he was doing to Mickey.  Absolutely.  Right.  You don't wreck a Jim Norton photo.  Yeah.  I don't even mind her being in it, but just the monstrous nature of the way she's hogging 
[02:10:30]  the whole picture.  Yeah, she's taking up the whole fucking frame.  I think he might have pulled her in there.  Look at this fucking beast.  Why is this beast in my picture?  That really is annoying.  I'm like...  I'm so annoyed right now.  Thank God for the other shot where he's scolding me because that's a much better photo.  But look at this fucking quad lady.  You can't even Photoshop her out.  It's an impossibility.  No.  She's taking up...  Big fucking quad lady.  You could put like...  I don't know.  What can I put next to me?  The Empire State Building? 
[02:11:00]  Put like some kind of mountain.  There's already one there.  That's what I mean.  Get her out.  Put a real mountain in there.  It looks like Mickey's, you know, peeking from around the corner.  Maybe a walrus in a scarf.  Her giant head.  It's like fucking Robert Plant.  He was fat and a lady.  She looks like a fat Deborah Norville.  Oh, she's enraging.  Hey, we got a guy pooping on slides.  Yeah, I read that...  Where is this happening?  It's Michigan.  Michigan. 
[02:11:30]  Michigan.  Got a children's park in Michigan and he's pooping on the slides in the same park for  the past five or six months.  Why would someone do this?  You want little kids to slide down in your shit.  He's the mystery pooper.  Oh.  Officials have discovered feces on the slides so frequently that police installed a hidden  camera to try to capture an image of the act.  Ah.  Put it on YouTube.  Mm-hmm.  Go viral.  I wish it was me.  They're saying the act is weird and deliberate.  Really?  Of course. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, you got something there?  What's that paragraph?  What?  What do you got, mustache?  This quote says, we most definitely need to get this under control before school recess  and park season starts.  Yes.  We need...  It's like a storyline for Parks and Rec.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  We got to get this under control.  That's pretty bad.  What a psycho.  How do they know it's not an animal?  It's too big, I guess. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, they know what human shit looks like.  Animals don't go up on a slide to take a shit either.  Exactly.  Squirrel shit.  No one's ever confused squirrel shit with human shit.  Big, giant fucking...  Animals have claws that slide down the slide.  We need to get him or her and get them the help they need.  It's him.  It's her.  Thank you.  They don't have to add the her part.  That's such a guy thing.  I've seen...  Yeah, this is like sociopathic.  This is guy shit.  But I've seen a lot of videos of late of women taking shits in public.  Yeah.  I've jumped off to those videos.  There's one where this woman, I think she's Asian, she's sitting on a bench or something. 
[02:13:00]  Right.  And she slides over to the side of it.  And lets it go?  And you just see this fucking...  Yeah, there it is.  This one.  No way.  Where's this from?  This is probably a fetish video, by the way.  No, this is real.  Yeah, but it's probably shot like this.  Oh, you think?  Of course.  Yeah, there's no way she would just do this.  She just squeaks to the edge and then just...  Yeah, this is fucking supposed to be...  Oh, my God!  That's how fucking liquidy it back was. 
[02:13:30]  The runny shit.  Yeah.  What the hell was she eating?  That's...  What a genius way to shit, though.  Wow.  Yes.  One cheek is on the side of the bench and she's just shitting off the bench.  Yeah, apparently she had a fucking...  A chocolate pudding coffee shake right before.  Which still...  I've never seen anything...  Yeah, she's wiping, yeah.  Yeah.  She's wiping right there.  No, Jimmy's right.  This is a set-up video.  Like napkins or...  Yeah.  Totally set-up video.  You think? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, it's for something to jerk off to.  Yeah?  Why would you jerk off to that?  But why would you shit...  Exactly, because it's liquidy.  Why would you shit like that?  There's got to be a bathroom close.  I don't know.  She would have ruined my photo less than Mickey Rooney's fucking monster wife.  Fucking monster lady.  Wife looks like the dump the Asian lady just left.  That was a big watery dump, huh?  Monster.  But there's...  I've seen a few of these where chicks are taking dumps.  Well, the ones in the alleyway, those I believe.  Yeah.  Because they're just looking for a place to pee on the way home or whatever. 
[02:14:30]  Those...  But not that one on a bench like that.  There's something hot about some drunk chick in one of those little fucking tube dresses  just pulling up and pissing on the street after a night at the club or something.  Those are always kind of...  Fair lady takes a shit.  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  No.  What's she doing?  What is she doing?  This looks like a real video.  Someone's got a shit like...  Someone's holding that camera. 
[02:15:00]  Wait, is that...  No, it's not a security video.  No, it looks handheld.  It's shaking.  Is that shit that's already on the ground now?  Did she just shit on the floor?  Like, I don't know what's happening.  Does it bounce off her leg?  Oh, she might have a fucking emergency or something.  She's wiping her...  She's wiping her shit off her leg with a jacket.  Go back a little bit, Sal.  What happened?  Did she...  She's telling the guy, close the door, get out of here.  This is real.  I don't know what happened. 
[02:15:30]  She had the runs.  Yeah, something happened.  And what?  Somebody wouldn't open the door?  She walked out to, like, the alleyway.  Yeah, she told the guy, get out of here.  She said, get out of here.  I got a problem.  But why wouldn't you spread...  Why wouldn't you spread your legs?  Maybe it just came out.  Let's see when it fucking comes out.  Just nuggets.  Do they bounce?  Yeah, they're already out.  Unless she's going to move her left foot.  And there they are.  Oh, she just stepped in it.  What a slob.  Ah, what a pig. 
[02:16:00]  What a slob.  You don't shit like that.  You got to spread your legs, at least.  Maybe she's trying to hold it in.  Fair lady.  She said fair maiden.  Yes, fair maiden.  Fair maiden takes her shit by a mop.  Let's go to Connor in North Dakota.  Connor.  Northern Atlantic.  Connor.  Oh.  Yeah, guys.  I was going to say there was a news story back.  I gave up.  It was maybe about a year or two ago.  I think it was back actually when I was in Virginia that there was a girl. 
[02:16:30]  She ran every single morning about this guy who's like alleyway.  And she kept on shooting behind his dumpster.  And he kept on finding you.  Day after day after day after day.  And he'd pipe up a camera.  They actually gave it to the police.  The police put it on the news.  And you could see the girl's face pretty clearly.  He just didn't want her to get in trouble or anything.  He just wanted to bear his hell out of her shit.  I'm sorry, sir.  I'm watching a video. 
[02:17:00]  A chick.  It looks like she shit in her hand.  Right.  And then throws it into a vestibule.  And throws it up against a door.  Up against a doorway.  Good girl.  What?  Ah!  She threw it in the fucking...  Yeah, but why...  She must have had it, but she probably couldn't move.  No, that was her wiping.  We are the worst witnesses.  No, she shot in her hand, dude.  She shot in her hand.  Then why was it white when she threw it? 
[02:17:30]  It's the light.  Watch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See?  Those are two nuggets.  That's the light hitting those two...  Two shit nuggets.  Let's see how it hits.  Watch.  It's the shit.  That's it, yeah.  It's all right.  Fair enough.  Yeah, that was the light.  That's so fucking disgusting.  You hate to see food places.  Why would she just go over there and shit instead of shitting into her hand?  I don't know.  Sorry, Connor.  We lost...  Oh, this fucking woman.  We lost interest in your call.  I apologize. 
[02:18:00]  She takes a shit in a supermarket aisle.  Oh, that's great.  Well, that's recycling, technically.  Ah!  Ah-ha-ha-ha!  And then just pulls up and walks away.  The best is that she just...  But most people understand that.  Kind of anti-social behavior.  But you've gotten to the point where you can't hold it in anymore.  No, that was...  But you've got to just go in the back or something.  That was on purpose, like, as a crazy thing to do.  Right.  Yeah.  Hmm.  She pulls her...  But she pulls her things...  Like, look at how fast this dump comes out. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, my God.  She barely had time to pull her pants down.  That's why I think she had an emergency.  Carvel soft serve.  Yeah, and then somebody else coming in the door.  And God bless her for looking back at it.  You've got to look.  You've got to look to see what you just did.  Who's the poor motherfucker that went...  What?  What?  Is this duty?  Wow.  I would leave my cart right there and fucking out of that store.  I'm not shopping in the shit aisle store. 
[02:19:00]  Well said.  Yes, thank you.  Does he take a shit?  Is it a girl?  It's a weightlifter.  It's a chick.  Is she shit?  Oh, my God.  What happened to her?  That was like a...  It was a viral video from back in the day.  This weightlifter girl.  Diarrhea fail?  Oh, it was diarrhea.  It goes through her...  But it goes right through her...  I think she...  She's lifting a lot of weight, though.  That's almost understandable.  Look at each ball in the house. 
[02:19:30]  Fail alive.  Ingemar X.  Correct me.  Oh, and then she just grinds it into the...  It might be pee.  Grinds it into the carpet.  Oh, my God.  Well, it was part of a montage.  Why would you stop the montage?  Yeah.  Yeah, best of diarrhea.  Come on.  There's so many diarrhea.  Diarrhea fail compilation.  This is what YouTube is made for.  Yeah.  The weightlifter one we saw.  Yeah, I want to see some more diarrhea fails.  Put this up on our Facebook page.  Oh, and a show.  Oh, this guy's trying to light his...  He's trying to light a fart, and he... 
[02:20:00]  Hey, he shits himself.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  He sharted.  She vomited.  This woman's vomiting live on the air of some show.  Oh, no.  Oh, come on.  That's a joke.  That's not true.  No way.  That can't be true.  No.  Here's one of these cool ones.  I think these are all fake, too.  Yeah, forget. 
[02:20:30]  We're out.  Just let some stew go in the jacuzzi or the pool.  Someone put E-Rock in my picture.  Oh, no.  Eating a hot dog.  Wait, is that...  Let me see.  Look at E-Rock in the way, eating a hot dog.  That's good.  It covers her up.  All right.  We could get people to cover up Mickey Rooney's wife in your photo for you.  Yeah, please cover up Cloverfield in my picture.  Oh, this one.  This is fake.  Jim Norton on Twitter will retweet some of the better ones.  And then, finally, we got the ping happening in the Indian Ocean. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is this finally it?  I don't know at this point.  They heard some pings on their instruments that would be the same type of pings thrown  off by the flight recorders.  Right.  So, hold on.  Lady Di wants to get...  She wants on real quick.  What the hell is this about?  Lady Di.  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  Good.  Why do you need to talk to us?  What's going on?  I wanted to ask you something.  The thing with Caroline and everything. 
[02:21:30]  When is this supposed to take place?  Are you supposed to have an unmasked show at Caroline's?  I thought this was an emergency.  I knew it was going to be this.  No, it's not really an emergency, but I was just asking about that.  Why?  How do you go about getting tickets for that?  We want to go, huh?  We didn't really promote it today.  I don't know.  How do they?  No, because I heard all about it.  I'm trying... 
[02:22:00]  Oh, my God.  My dear, sweet Jesus, Lord.  Christ.  How are we promoting this mustache?  SiriusXM.com slash unmasked.  You got it?  Yeah, that's where you go, right?  But you have to be a subscriber to SiriusXM, right?  I think that's...  Is that it?  Yeah, you got it.  You have to be a subscriber.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to have to get somebody else to do that.  Then, you know... 
[02:22:30]  Who do you know that's a subscriber?  Well, Marion is, for one.  Well, there you go.  All right.  Maybe she'll take you out.  All right.  All right.  Well, listen, listen, listen.  Yeah.  One more thing.  When is this event supposed to take place?  What day?  Holy fuck.  I don't know.  They're still trying to figure it out.  Oh, they're still trying to figure it out?  It's not going to be like on a Friday or something?  It might be tomorrow, but they're not really sure yet.  Because I heard something about April 17th. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, something about...  How do you...  No, no, no.  I'm just saying.  But April 17th, they have something else going on at Caroline's.  Uh-huh.  Which has, you know, really nothing to do with XM Sirius.  Exactly.  It has to do with Hot 97.  Yeah.  She raises a great point.  Are we there the same rate as Hot 97?  Hot 97?  No.  I don't think so, Jimmy.  I'm not asking you. 
[02:23:30]  Jesus.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  How many 90 ices have you had this morning?  It's 1030.  Around four.  That's four.  That's good.  That's a good start.  Good start.  That's a solid six to seven before noon.  Yeah.  You're not bad.  Normal for me.  Somewhere around there.  Uh-huh.  No, no, no.  Seriously, though.  Seriously.  Big booty girl.  Can you sit around day after day drinking that much beer, Ant? 
[02:24:00]  No.  It just would be, uh, all right, not good.  All right, Lady Di, good luck to you.  Yeah, so it's like a big, some black event, I think, I guess, or, yeah.  Is Sam there today, or is he still in New Orleans?  All right.  Thank you, Lady Di.  Eight o'clock show.  That night.  Because she wants to-  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Is Sam there today?  Because she wants to glom on to Sam's show.  Right.  Also.  All right, thanks for calling in, Lady Di.  It's the only reason you'd care if Sam was in is so you could call up and get on his show. 
[02:24:30]  Well, I like Sam.  All right, thanks for calling there, Lady Di.  It's been great, so.  All right, well, go ahead, hang up.  I, I'm not, it's not a hang up if I say thanks for calling.  Yeah.  Okay, you're welcome.  Let me say hi to Al and, uh, Buffalo.  Hey, guys.  Buffalo, Al.  I don't think Bobo or Lady Di or any of them idiots should be at your own man's thing.  It's all about you guys.  They don't need to be there.  That's probably a good-  Yeah, I don't want any of those guys.  Good point.  Why don't we need, why don't you want us to be there? 
[02:25:00]  Because it's not-  You guys are just going to mess up the whole thing.  It's all about you guys.  I was just trying to-  I was just trying to find out some information on the show.  I think this guy makes a good point.  He makes a very good point.  We don't have a lot of seats in that, uh, in that, uh, place there.  No.  That Caroline's there.  There's another fan.  How many nanny ices there, Lady Di?  This is RC could be another three fans that get to see the show.  All right, Al.  Thank you for bringing up a great point.  Lady Di, thank you so much. 
[02:25:30]  You're welcome.  I'm hanging on.  For what?  All right.  So they found a pang, and it might be the plane.  We'll find out more.  I'm sure more info will come up, and, uh-  I'll tune in CNN, because they're the last ones on the story.  Everyone else moved on ten days ago.  Yeah.  Guy's still on the flight simulator.  Is he really?  Yeah.  Yeah, they were doing other flight simulator stuff over the weekend.  Oh, my God.  Ridiculous.  And they're still standing in the middle of the Indian Ocean? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, they're doing the stand in the middle and watching the virtual reality plane fly around them.  But that plane would be giant.  It's giant.  It's got to be a giant plane.  It would be so easy to find.  Because it doesn't make sense.  Right.  Because Australia is very small in that.  I want to do something.  Situation.  Like where we do it, but instead of, like, the plane simulator, we don't have it.  So I just put my arms out and act like a plane.  And you're going...  That would be just as good as well.  It would be more entertaining, actually. 
[02:26:30]  All right, we're going to go home.  So the ping is happening.  We'll see what the ping's all about.  War.  War.  War.  Who's doing the after show today?  Dennis Falcone and E-Rock.  Denny Falcone.  And the E-Rock?  And E-Rock.  And the E.  It's going to be awesome.  That is awesome.  That is some solid awesomeness.  Personified.  Jimmy's in Tampa this week, and don't forget.  Yep.  Friday, Saturday, and then I got Caroline's.  The week after you guys do your thing, I'm at Caroline's.  Yes. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, and I went into the t-shirt business.  I got a plug today.  Oh, shit.  Right.  Check out the empties, man.  T-shirts are available.  Put them out there as a goof, and they're actually selling extremely well.  Well, they are.  Go to opiradio.com slash shop.  I need a catchphrase.  You do?  Dude, you do.  This just takes a catchphrase.  You already have one, but it's only one word, and nobody will wear it on a shirt.  I need a catchphrase.  As goofy as it is. 
[02:27:30]  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Damn.  Yeah.  In two days.  So opiradio.com slash shop.  Yep.  In two days.  Crazy.  And I'm not making a lot of them, because it's too much of a fucking hassle, as you learned  with your compound shirts.  Yes.  Very.  Bunch of pain in the ass.  Get them now, because we're not going to keep reordering them.  No fucking way.  All right?  Wait, I have a t-shirt I'm selling.  Yeah.  It's going to be called, where's those empties? 
[02:28:00]  No.  What?  That's a little similar to the other one, man.  No.  He's going to check out the empties, man.  And mine is, where's those empties?  Put my arms up in the air.  No.  It's too similar.  And we've got fat sizes, too.  So go get them.  They only have fat sizes.  A lot of fat sizes.  Triple XL and up.  Pretty much sold out.  Yeah.  Very close.  All right, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thank you.  Right.  The Opie and Anthony Show is drawn to a close.

[02:37:30]  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW now.  Now.  And look back on another legendary day of broadcasting.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Post Show.  Post Show.  With Sam Roberts.  Roberts.  No, no, no.  Sam is way down yonder in New Orleans, as Freddie Boom Boom Cannon would say.  Do you know that song, E-Rock?  No, not familiar.  Great tune.  I don't think most of our audience is either.  We're going to have to crack that one up. 
[02:38:00]  What's that?  What year?  It's in a 63 song.  Good stuff.  Yeah, they don't know that.  Way down yonder in New Orleans.  That's where he is.  This is Dennis Falcone, your broadcast professional, and my trusty sidekick, E-Rock, here.  What's wrong with you today?  You sound down.  Not as much coffee.  Just trying to cut down on the coffee.  Why?  Okay, then I'll pump it up.  I will pump it up here on the Sunshine Committee.  This is your big shot.  I'm just having some fun.  Just here on the Sunshine Committee.  I'm not depressed.  I'm happy.  Well, I am kind of depressed.  I mean, John Panette, very sad that he passed away.  I mean, people have said that Mickey Rooney was 93 years old, you know. 
[02:38:30]  John Panette, 50 years young.  What a shame.  And that routine, the You Go Now, You Here 4 Hour, the Chinese food buffet.  You Go Now, You've Been Here 4 Hour.  That's such a great routine.  That's a classic bit.  And I think that was on one of the young comedian specials that it might have been on on HBO.  I think it was also one of those when Fox used to do those comedy specials on Saturdays.  Okay.  Like Saturday late at night.  Yeah.  I think it was on one of those as well.  But that bit's been around forever.  And that's the bit I know John Panette from.  Right.  I mean, I know he's had a full body of work, but that was the one that always... 
[02:39:00]  Full body.  Okay.  But that's the one that always stuck with me.  866-969-1969 if you want to talk to Denny here on the phone show.  And Jimmy said he was a very, very nice guy, and he had some health issues.  A lot of comics hit social media over the weekend.  Nothing but nice things to say about that guy.  And this came across yesterday as one.  I guess he passed away Saturday.  Saturday afternoon, and then I think it really broke on Sunday.  And the other thing, again, Mickey Rooney, 93 years young, as we like to say, in the DJ world. 
[02:39:30]  And the movie that I love him in, it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world.  I love that movie, too.  Great movie.  You couldn't make 10 minutes of that movie today with all the talent that they had in that great movie.  They did.  They did remake it.  Yeah.  And it was awful.  Yeah.  It was not memorable.  I forgot what they called it, but it was exactly the same movie, and it was mostly black actors.  Right.  And you had the premise kind of redone in the Cannonball Run movies.  That was kind of the same kind of theme, you know, that big ensemble cast.  Well, Mad, Mad World. 
[02:40:00]  Well, there's a lot more Mads in that title, but it was before the Cannonball Run.  Right before that, yeah.  They kind of set the bar for all that shticky stuff in movies.  1963 or so, and that was just a phenomenal movie.  Losing some big stars over the weekend, and Morgan Spurlock was here today.  He was a great guest, and it's kind of interesting because the first time he broke on the scene,  everybody knew him from the Supersize Me.  And kind of tying that into you, you said that you've given up diet soda.  You haven't drank diet soda in a couple months ago.  I gave up all soda on New Year's Day. 
[02:40:30]  That's good.  It was the last day.  And it's over four months, and I was thinking about it over the weekend.  It's been four months, but I don't feel much different.  Well, it's only soda.  No, but there is some withdrawals to it with caffeine and the amount that you're having.  Right.  I got past that point, but all the other stuff that's in soda, like the aspartame and all that,  somewhere down the line you're supposed to start feeling a lot better because you're not on the soda anymore.  But I think for all the years of drinking so much of it, it's going to take a lot longer. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But for four months, no soda, no craving for it.  So it's been good.  When I used to do overnights years and years ago on a radio station, you'd go in there with a 32-ounce bottle of Diet Coke  and just drinking that throughout the night just to stay awake.  And by the end of the six-hour show, your stomach is killing you because you just drank caffeine and sugar,  or no sugar, but all the other chemicals in there.  Are you a coffee drinker?  No, no coffee.  Well, that's with caffeine.  Just tea.  You're like, I'll drink.  I love coffee.  I'll drink five, six cups of coffee a day.  But by Saturday morning, if I don't have coffee at 8 o'clock in the morning, I'm like, you start getting a headache. 
[02:41:30]  No one cares about this.  We do have line of the day.  We're just talking about coffee and soda and drinks like that.  We do have line of the day, right, Sal?  Yes, Danny.  All right.  Let's fire up the line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  How weird.  You just had a paparazzi shot.  I see. 
[02:42:00]  Pat's coming in right now.  Now our own one of your episodes.  Slobberazzi.  Sorry.  Oh, E-Rock.  Of course.  Who picked that cut?  I did.  Of course.  I didn't think E-Rock would have picked that cut of the day.  And we do have some cuts from this morning.  And I like the Bruce Springsteen one because, I mean, God, you know, Roland just loves Bruce Springsteen.  And I guess he brought some live songs to the attention of the boys. 
[02:42:30]  Some covers.  Some covers.  And, Sal, if you have cut number 10, let's take a look at that one.  Like what?  He doesn't need exposure.  Look, Bruce doesn't need fucking exposure.  But for a new audience, though.  No, he could sell out arenas for multiple nights on end.  He's done it.  Everyone knows who Bruce is.  Everyone knows what he's all about.  There's not anyone that needs exposure to see Bruce to go like, oh, is that Bruce?  The younger audience, though.  But also it's a different band.  It's with Tom Morello.  Now it's Little Steven. 
[02:43:00]  Is Bruce the guy that's singing the song?  Is Bruce playing guitar?  Yes.  Is Little Steven there?  No.  I think that makes a good point.  I think this guy is probably bored with his life and has nothing else going on for himself.  So he forces his poor band to do two-hour and 40-minute concerts on a Sunday night.  Gratis.  He's got a basketball.  He gives the ref the basketball.  It's a guitar tech.  It's kind of douchey.  He puts a guitar on.  Who wears the same outfit in every show?  Oh, no. 
[02:43:30]  They're going to do a jump ball between two guitars.  Why are they jump balling?  And then they hit it into the crowd.  And now they're playing jump?  Yeah.  Why are they hitting the ball?  Because it's jump.  It's basketball.  They jump.  Who's that dude?  That's his wife.  That's who?  That's his wife.  Oh, that one.  Miss Calfie.  I thought it was Nick Cannon.  The one that stole away from his other chick back in the day.  The one that was in the video. 
[02:44:00]  He blew off the hot chick.  Yeah.  For the, uh...  You know.  How long is this intro?  Nice.  Sounds like the high school version.  Oh, no.  It sucked.  That sucked.  This is terrible.  Oh, no.  You've got to come. 
[02:44:30]  They're all wearing hats.  Where is this?  Dallas.  Oh, it must be freezing.  Oh, this is awful.  I've got to hear the look, though.  Oh, yeah.  Should I have her?  Patrick Stewart?  Patrick Stewart on keyboard.  Do you like this?  No.  This is horrible.  Back on the Post Show with Denny and E-Rock.  And let's go to line two.  We have Vinny in Red Bank to talk about Bruce Springsteen.  Hello, Vinny.  Still there, Vinny? 
[02:45:00]  Hello, Vinny.  He's there.  Vinny.  Vinny, on line two.  You wanted to talk about Bruce Springsteen?  No, Vinny.  Well, what he wanted to say was that Roland did fail to point out that when Bruce does these covers,  he usually tries to tie it into the location that he's playing at.  Like when he was in Australia, he did Highway to Hell and whatnot.  He did a Bee Gees song, too.  I think he did that as well.  He did.  I was like, whoa.  But Roland loves these covers.  I hear him in the office every week that there's a new one. 
[02:45:30]  He's listening to this over and over and over.  And it sounds like he's singing over a bad MIDI file.  Well, he's a Springsteen maniac.  And most, you know, Springsteen fans, I mean, they kind of love everything that Bruce does.  So that was a little cut about the bad Van Halen cover.  Now, I want to go to one call here.  Justin in Oklahoma wants to talk to you, Denny.  Okay.  Hello, Justin.  How are you?  How are you today, sir?  Good.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, listen.  I'm the guy a few weeks ago that ripped you apart with the fact that you had 75 ums and uhs. 
[02:46:00]  And you kind of took it very constructively.  And I'd like to say I'm very impressed with the dynamic you've created there,  especially with EROC jumping in a little bit more.  I've only heard about four or five of us in the last 20 minutes.  And I'm extremely impressed with you.  Well, thank you.  I'm glad you pointed it out because it'll make me a better broadcaster.  So thank you very much for calling in on that.  I do appreciate it.  And one more call wants to pay kudos to Denny.  Hello.  This is Dennis.  How are you?  Hello.  Hi. 
[02:46:30]  How are you doing, Dennis?  I'm doing good.  Oh, very good.  Very good.  You're doing a great job at the post show.  You're doing a very good job at it.  Well, thank you very much.  Who is this?  All right.  It's me.  It's Lady Di.  Oh, it's Lady Di.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Hi, Evoque.  Hi.  Hey, have you heard about the Unmasked that we're doing with Opie and Anthony,  hosted by Ronnie Bennington?  Yes, I have.  I have heard about it.  And where do you get tickets for that?  I think you have to register online, right?  Right.  SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[02:47:00]  Right.  And you have to be a subscriber.  Slash Unmasked.  Oh, it's Unmasked?  Slash Unmasked.  All right.  Well, the link's on the Opie and Anthony page as well, but Slash Unmasked.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  So, April 17th.  Yes.  I don't know.  I mean, you know, it's a Thursday and everything like that.  Not that I have anything to do lately, but, you know, Mary won't be able to go.  Well, maybe if you speak to Sam, I think Sam has his own guest list, so he might be able  to hook you up there.  You know, it's really not what, you know, it's who you know, like anything else. 
[02:47:30]  Well, no, it's not even that.  I mean, you know, I mean, it's a Thursday and...  So, what's the problem?  It's going to be at 4 o'clock, right?  Right.  Where do you have to be Thursday night or Friday morning, for that matter?  All right.  Now, you said Caroline's at 4 o'clock?  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Well, you know, get me a couple of tickets.  I don't know.  I mean...  How about please?  Get me.  Yeah.  It's just get me a couple of tickets.  Are we just supposed to provide all previous interns with tickets? 
[02:48:00]  Right.  Get me a couple of tickets.  This isn't convenient for me.  I'm doing nothing.  I don't want to come into the city on a Thursday afternoon to see a show that you allegedly  love.  Are we going to be hiring staff, support staff, promotional staff for that event?  I'm sure we'll have people in place.  Maybe.  Can I ask you a question?  Please.  Who is going to be at the show?  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, Ron Bennington.  And Ron Bennington.  That's all we need.  That's it right there.  That's all you need.  That's the stars.  All right.  Maybe one day you'll get tickets and you can come and join us. 
[02:48:30]  Apply online.  Maybe talk to Sam.  See what you can do, Lady Di.  Okay.  All right, Lady Di.  Thank you so much for calling in.  We do appreciate your time this morning.

They're leading the revolution.  Healthcare revolution.  You need t-shirts like that that say Opie and Anthony.  Talk to Opie.  He's in that business now.  Yeah, he's making t-shirts up.  What's the t-shirt going to say?  Check out the Empties Match.  Is it M-O-N from Mon?  I'm sure it is.  OpieRadio.com.  All right.  So we'll check that out.  And the West Coast feat is coming up.  Do we have some business to take care of, Mr. EROC? 
[02:49:30]  I'm all good.  We had a lot of great stuff today that we just didn't have time to get to.  Right.  Morgan Spurlock, WrestleMania, you know, the electrocution videos.  I was surprised you didn't go to WrestleMania.  Not this year.  I went the last two years.  To see you in the building.  I was very surprised.  I thought you'd be there.  I wanted to, but not this year.  All right.  Maybe next year.  Well, I thank you very much, Sam.  We'll be back tomorrow with the pre- and post-show.  This is Dennis Falcone and my trusty sidekick, EROC.  Again, thank you so much for Sal.

[02:55:00]  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Patrice.  Good morning.  I have a feeling you might have something to say about the Michael Vick thing.  Because I remember when this whole thing went down, you were like,  you guys don't understand the culture of what goes on.  I love dogs.  Love them more than people, as Bill was saying.  I love dogs.  I knew you'd have something to say.  Go ahead.  I couldn't.  People who are vicious to animals bug me.  You know, especially if you're up at 4 o'clock in the morning watching I Love Lucy. 
[02:55:30]  And Sarah McLaughlin comes on.  Oh, I will remember you.  Showing a picture of a kitten with conjunctivitis.  And a fucking puppy smoking a cigarette with a fucking headache bag on.  If you don't feel bad for animals after you're watching a fucking watery-eyed kitten.  Dude, that is the fucking worst commercial.  And it's in between fucking Carol Burnett, fucking Guthy Ranker selling Carol Burnett, 
[02:56:00]  and a Lucy.  And it's so long, the commercial.  And a fucking pit bull puppy missing a paw.  Snorting cocaine.  He has no home.  Now, if you don't fucking feel for an animal after you watch that,  you're a fucking serial killer.  The one-eyed cat.  You're a hunk of shit.  A kitten with a fucking, with pink eye doesn't fuck you up. 
[02:56:30]  You're a cocksucker.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Turn this shit off, man.  I don't want to see that shit.  I don't want to see that, man.  We're watching the commercial.  The dog with the paralyzed back legs.  Oh, fucking no.  Oh, look at that.  What a bad boy he's been.  That dog looks so sad.  Look, it misbehaved.  Dude, I can't even, I can't even look at that commercial. 
[02:57:00]  It ruins me.  I'm Sarah McLachlan.  Yes, bitch.  I spread peanut butter on my pussy.  Let the dog lick it off.  Oh, she sings his sad songs.  I know.  And it gets sadder and sadder, bitch.  Kill yourself.  Throw a Frigbee to that fucking thing.  These poor animals, man.  That looks like a healthy dog.  Exactly.  The whole thing's about money.  Look at the poor little kids.  It ain't about money.  A kitten, kittens with a headache is the worst thing ever.  A headache bag.  A fucking headache bag. 
[02:57:30]  I love that.  A old school cartoon headache bag.  And a cigarette and fucking deep thoughts and shit.  I don't need it.  Goddamn, Patrice.  I fucking, I love animals.  There's a three-legged cat.  Jesus.  Three-legged cat.  What's wrong with that dog?  That dog looks normal.  I don't know.  Look at more.  I don't.  What's wrong with these animals?  They mostly look okay.  And how long is this fucking infomercial?  Forever.  This goddamn thing takes so long.  Yeah, but you don't know what these animals did to bother the owners. 
[02:58:00]  They don't share the whole picture.  I refuse to look at it any longer, man.  The guy's fucking scrubbing his pots and pans with a kitten's eye.  Yeah, exactly.  Who are these people who hate animals, man?  I don't know.  I love animals, but I will punch a kitten squarely in the middle of its face.  If it mews while I'm watching TV, I will punch it squarely in its face.  If it mews.  Fucking assholes, man.  When I was a little kid, I used to make believe, hey, the Billy Joel Show.

[03:02:30]  Joe Wilkins.  You're listening to the O.B. and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  The Joe Rogan experience begins now.  Buckle up, you bitches.  Here we go.  Let me tell you what I experienced at my job.  You know, and ask someone who's a massage therapist, what's a human being like?  Oh, they seem pleasant.  You know, sometimes they're tense. 
[03:03:00]  I know, listen, my sister worked at a hair salon in Silver Lake in the 80s.  And I said to her, what percentage of guys you think are gay?  And she's like, 80%?  Of all guys everywhere are gay.  She wasn't great at math.  But in her world, it was 115% were gay.  So I think she knocked off like 35% and went round it down to 80%.  Well, that's her world.  Everyone is gay.  That's a great analogy. 
[03:03:30]  And it's that with cops.  Like, what percentage of people are assholes?  Oh, 90%?  Yeah.  You know, because that's who they're dealing with versus massage therapist.  But I always had this feeling, I don't know, I always said that, you know, cop suicides  are always really...  Yeah.  Very high.  Very high?  Yeah.  Stress.  But, you know, here's my theory.  It's kind of my black cock and porn theory.  I have a feeling that if I walked around and had a gun on me at all times, I would have 
[03:04:00]  killed myself 15 times by now.  Really?  Yeah.  I just feel like if you put a gun on a guy's hip, most guys, guys that, you know, have  that feeling of your girlfriend dumped me, you know, literally you walked into your apartment  and saw your best buddy balls deep in your girlfriend, and then you walked out back to  the car and just fucking sat there with that thousand yard stare, and they realized there 
[03:04:30]  was a gun on your fucking hip, a lot of guys would have just put it in their mouth.  A lot of guys would go back there and shoot the both of them first.  Or shoot the both of them, and then put the gun in your mouth.  I'm just saying, the modality for killing yourself, being strapped onto your hip 24-7, is going to  put the likelihood of you killing yourself.  I mean, what if you just said, here's what a guy does.  Oh, he stands next to the edge of really tall bridges. 
[03:05:00]  Those guys would have a much higher likelihood of killing themselves, too, because every fucking  time they heard a piece of bad news, a certain percentage of them would step off it, right?  A certain percentage.  I think a certain percentage of cops, suicide, you know, everyone talks, oh, it's a stressful  job and all what they see in depression, blah, blah, blah.  A lot of it is having a suicide machine strapped to your hip all the fucking time.  I've never thought of it that way. 
[03:05:30]  It's got to up the anthony a little bit, right?  Most certainly.  It's the trigger out, literally, is right there on your hip.  By law, even when you're on your days off, that shit's got to be there.  Yeah, I guess, you know, I've never thought about killing myself, so I kind of, when I  say I relate, I don't.  You know, I've always been of the idea that life will eventually get better, as we talked  about before.  You know, I've never thought, but I've never had, like, a mental depression issue that I 
[03:06:00]  have friends who clearly have.  I have friends that had real deep, unquestionable chemical problems, and they cured it through  antidepressants, but I've never had that.  So I don't understand that thought process, the kill yourself thought process, but I've  seen it enough to know that I wouldn't want everybody to have a gun strapped to their hip.  I think you're right.  I think a lot of people would make that fatal mistake.  Especially, we were talking earlier about being a dude and being 24, and just making 
[03:06:30]  really bad snap decisions.  Murder would go up for sure, I think.  Or, you know, maybe eventually it would mellow out.  The old adage of a well-armed society is a polite society.  Right.  But there's that expression, I don't remember who made it, but it's that when you, all you  have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  Yeah.  If there's no diplomatic solution available because you're carrying a .44 Magnum in your 
[03:07:00]  pocket.  Well, that's my feeling with shit like, you know, uh, I mean, when I was doing the man  show, one of the writers got a hold of one of those tasers and it was like electric tasers,  not, not the, not the serious cop ones, which I have been, I have been hit by one of those  serious cop ones, but the personal kind of mail order ones, he tased every fucking person  in the building, you know, I mean, how bad was it when he tased you? 
[03:07:30]  It's uncomfortable, but it's, you know, it's like, ow.  Yeah.  That, that, that's what it is.  But the point is, is if you're walking around with pepper spray on your belt, you're going  to fucking use that pepper spray at some point.  Yeah.  I mean, most people would.  Yeah.  It's almost the having it that makes you use it.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  Right.  And there's, it's that kind of, kind of thing where that's, you know, I like the idea of 
[03:08:00]  people being able to protect themselves.  I also feel like you walk around with a gun strapped to your hip long enough.  It's coming out at some point, whereas you and I don't walk around with a gun.  So we'd probably figure out a way other than that to resolve this issue.  Well, it certainly takes a deep responsibility.  Like you, you have to have a deep understanding of the responsibility that you carry and you 
[03:08:30]  carry it around all the time.  This ability to end life like that.  Yeah.  And you're carrying it everywhere you go.  And anybody who's been out shooting, and I've been out shooting, to feel what a 44 feels  like in your hand and then squeezing off and just the recoil and everything, it's powerful.  Unbelievable.  Like you couldn't imagine pointing that at somebody and squeezing the trigger.  The people that do that on either side of the badge, the people that do that sort of routinely 
[03:09:00]  or cavalierly, you know, the people that do the, I asked the guy for his wallet and he  wouldn't give it to me, so I shot him.  It seems insane because if you've actually gone down to a range and just felt that power  and that responsibility and just the recoil, the kickback and the sort of visceral whatever  firing off a few rounds from that 44, you couldn't imagine pointing it at somebody and squeezing 
[03:09:30]  that trigger.  Well, it's kind of interesting.  Like, I am 100% for people being allowed to possess firearms, but I also am 100% shocked  that more firearm deaths and accidents don't happen.  If you think of the idea that all these people around us, millions of people around us, can  legally have guns, and if they legally have guns, like, what is the, how come we're not 
[03:10:00]  hearing pow, pow, pow, like guns going off left and right?  People are retarded.  Like, I'm shocked every time I get on the highway, and I'm amazed that people can go  70 miles an hour, a couple of feet away from another thing going 70 miles an hour, and  they don't just fucking slam into each other left and right, back and forth.  It's a constant maze of accidents.  Yeah, no, I think that same way every time I drive, and I think the same way when I hear  that, you know, there's a gun, you know, however many guns are in circulation in the United 
[03:10:30]  States are basically one for every citizen that's out there, and we all know about David  Arquette or Andy Dick or any other nut job that's out there.  You take all the people that are having emotional issues or a little bit off, and all the medication  that's out there and all the booze that's out there, and then you mix that with all the  guns that are out there, why do we not step outside of the studio and hear gunfire going 
[03:11:00]  off left and right?  Yeah, it's kind of amazing when you think about it.  And it's also amazing how many fucking people there are out there that are going through  problems that keep it together.  There's a lot of people out there.  Their life is shit and turmoil, and they still manage to get to work every day, do their  fucking job, and pull out of the ashes.  I mean, we concentrate on the people that just go, fuck this, boom!  Right.  But how many people think about going fuck this and make it, and figure it out, and then 
[03:11:30]  ten years later, hey, ten years ago, my life was in a shambles.  I was ready to kill myself.  Now, look at me.  I'm happy.  I'm doing great.  I've got a family.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Thank God I was thrown out of the police academy, or I would have killed myself.  Yeah, so whatever it is, whatever it is that allows people to pull through.  I mean, I'm all for it, because I think we're all people.  I know that you can handle driving a car, and I know that I can handle driving a car. 
[03:12:00]  But I also know that some people are going to drive drunk, fucked up, go 120 miles an  hour, slam into other people, and kill people.  So if that person exists, should we keep that right from everybody?  No.  I say no.  I say people should be allowed to drive cars until they show that they're a danger  driving a car.  Unfortunately, there's only one way to do that.  You've got to fuck up somebody else's time.  Right.  You've got to fuck up.  And that's the real issue.  It's like the amount of actual cars driving in comparison to the amount of fatal accidents 
[03:12:30]  is fucking insanely high.  Right.  Insanely high.  I mean, the odds of you driving around and not having a fatal accident are pretty fucking  sporty.  Right.  They're pretty sporty.  But when things do go wrong, people automatically look for the most drastic measure.  Like, we've got to take guns away from people.  We've got to pull the guns.  We've got to Google car everything.  No more driving your own car.  That's coming, Adam Carolla. 
[03:13:00]  I know.  And I know you're a car nut.  That Google car shit, once they get that down, there's going to be no reason for you  to be able to weave in and out of Google cars and make it to work.  Well, you know, I always say we're a bizarre society, and we should always just work big  to small, and we don't.  Like, you take Los Angeles.  We're basically last in education.  Our schools are nuts.  It is nuts. 
[03:13:30]  And our schools are failing our kids.  And then you turn on the news, and they say, new legislation out of Sacramento wanting  to ban e-cigarettes.  And you're like, sorry, Ethan Hawke, but the point, oh, no, wait, what was I thinking?  Oh, Stephen Dorff.  The point is this.  Get those guys confused.  E-cigarettes.  Who the fuck cares about e-cigarettes?  Now, look, I don't hope that my kids grow up to smoke e-cigarettes, but I don't give 
[03:14:00]  a fuck if there's some 45-year-old guy who's trying to get off the butts and is standing  outside of his job smoking an e-cigarette, and I walk by and get a little fucking water  vapor on my scalp.  I'm fine with that.  I wouldn't give a shit if everyone smoked an e-cigarette if we could get from 50th in  education up into the top 20. 
[03:14:30]  I don't know why we have the worst traffic congestion on the planet and the worst schools  in America, and yet every piece of legislation is surrounded about fast food workers need  to start wearing gloves to handle the food back.  I don't give a fuck about that.  I don't give a fuck about e-cigarettes.  I don't know who does.  I don't know an individual that has ever been harmed by an e-cigarette. 
[03:15:00]  I don't know an individual that's ever been harmed by a guy who works at Taco Bell making  his fucking burrito by hand.  Everything I've eaten in my entire life that's come from a restaurant, some guy made with his  hands.  I'm fucking fine.  What I don't like is the schools being last.  Why that's not an issue, I don't know.  I don't like both.  I don't like dudes with dirty hands making my tacos, and I don't like shitty schools.  Right.  But, to me, if you give me a choice, and I'm in Sacramento, I'm going to focus on the 
[03:15:30]  schools, and when I get that settled, then I'm going to focus on the guy who's picking  his nose and making my taquito.  But, obviously, the people that are bringing up this e-cigarette thing, it's coming from  someone in the health department looking for another thing to do.  I mean, it's the only thing that makes sense.  It's like some new project to take on.  When you look at the actual effects of the second-hand vapor, it's non-existent.  There's nothing there.  There's no data.  There's nothing that shows it's dangerous.  The other problem, though, is those big fucking cannons that these dudes are carrying around. 
[03:16:00]  People are carrying around these big, giant electric...  Like, Brian Redband had one, and he was blowing it in here, and I'm like, I'm breathing in  that stuff.  That's not the same as one of those blue e-cigs.  Right.  All those things are not created equal, I don't think.  But think about what you're breathing in when a guy's got a leaf blower going in your  neighbor's driveway, and he's just fucking all the shit that's on the ground, all the  pesticides, everything, all the pollen, all the dander, and all the shit that is vulcanized 
[03:16:30]  rubber and cockroach fecal matter.  When that all goes fucking airborne, and now you're taking your dog or your kid for a walk  up the street, what do you think that's like?  And what's it like when you're walking down a busy sidewalk in downtown LA and a big municipal  bus goes blowing by at 40 miles an hour and whatever's getting kicked up and coming off  of that?  Yep.  I'll take a fucking e-cigarette any day.  Another thing to think about is brake dust. 
[03:17:00]  People don't think about brake dust.  Oh, yeah.  Brake dust is real.  Everywhere around you, everywhere you go when you see traffic, you have brake dust that's  in the air.  People are hitting their brakes.  The brakes are disintegrating.  It's all over the wheels.  Whenever you clean your car, you know this.  You clean your wheel, and you see all that black powder?  Well, that shit's not just stuck to your wheel.  It's in the air.  Yeah.  And people who live near highways, they're breathing that stuff in all fucking day.  It's, by the way, the biggest manufacturer of brake pads is called Raybestos. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, no.  What a terrible name.  I think they were around before asbestos was as bad as it is, but Raybestos.  Were they really?  They were brake pad manufacturers around before asbestos?  Well, no.  Before asbestos was bad.  Oh, before it was bad.  And I think Raybestos, I mean, you've got to look it up on your computer, but I think it  probably had asbestos in it.  I mean, because there's a ton of heat generated by the brakes.  Right.  That makes sense.  If it's composite.  And it needs to be something that is going to be heat-resistant and, you know, not wear 
[03:18:00]  all, you know, it's not a chunk of rubber.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Huh.  That's interesting.  It's interesting, too, that they haven't figured out anything better for a brake than  a piston that slams a pad against a piece of steel that's next to your wheel.  It fucking gives you friction.  Yeah.  Incredible amounts of friction, slow that motherfucker down.  I mean, that's what they figured out for brakes.  I just got back from a vintage race last weekend, and I drove an old Datsun, and the brakes 
[03:18:30]  in the old Datsun, although they don't work nearly as good as the one in the new car, it's  the exact same thing.  It's a piston.  It's a pad.  Pushes down.  Hits a rotor.  Squeezes it.  Creates friction.  And that's that.  Now, you know, but the steering wheel and the wheels and the internal combustion engine  haven't changed.  Not much.  Either.  I mean, it's all the rear end and the transmission. 
[03:19:00]  It's all a thousand times better in a new car than it is in one of these old race cars,  but it's still just same old, same old.  And the electronic suspensions, too.  The suspensions nowadays with stability management systems and traction control and all the different  calculations the car is making as you're driving.  Oh, I was driving my wife's Audi, and it applied the brake for me.  Why?  Because I was driving like a dick.  So it started slowing you down?  No.  It said you're going to T-bone the car that's ahead of you. 
[03:19:30]  Like, you're going to go up the ass of the car in front of you.  And I'm like, I know what I'm doing.  That's how I drive, you know?  And it's like, well, according to our data, you're going to hit this guy.  I just picked up my foot to put it on the brake pedal, and it popped out of my foot and  depressed for me.  Wow.  So the thing basically said was, you know, I was doing a show at, like, the Irvine Improv,  all the fucking traffic, you know, between here and there, and, you know, I had to be 
[03:20:00]  there at 8 o'clock or whatever, and I was trying to make some time just driving down  the Hollywood freeway.  And so I was on it when there was a little opening, and then brake lights, and this thing  broke for me.  Wow.  And I'm, because I do a lot of driving, I'm used to just doing it on my own, you know?  Did you see that controversy about that reporter, what was the name, Jeremy Cahill, what the 
[03:20:30]  fuck was his name, who died, who was, he exposed a bunch of shit about General Petraeus and  some other generals, and he was just generally like a rabble-rouser type reporter, and he  was constantly worried that he was going to get killed, constantly talking to people that  were saying they were going to kill him.  And then one day, like 4 o'clock in the morning, driving down Sunset, goes like 100 miles an  hour into a tree, with no evidence that he's tried to slow down or stop, the engine goes 
[03:21:00]  flying from the car like it was an explosion.  Yeah.  Michael Hastings.  Michael Hastings, that's his name.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do remember that story.  Yeah.  And, you know, I just...  Kind of went away, didn't it?  Well, the thing is, everything just kind of goes away now, because they're...  There's so much.  There's so much, and everyone is broken off, you know.  I don't know...  I don't know if we could have another Watergate, you know, because there's just too many people 
[03:21:30]  that are into their shit, and there's...  You know, there used to be three news outlets, you know, the major three networks, whatever,  the evening news, Walter Cronkite, whatever.  Now there's just so many outlets, so many stories, and so much that needs to feed that  machine, you know, to 24-hour news stations, outlets. 
[03:22:00]  You've got to keep that shit...  You've got to keep those plates spinning.  And our attention span is just not long enough.  Yeah, there's always some new Malaysian airliner thing or something.  Right, and we just don't care.  Yeah.  And, I mean, ultimately, we're sort of narcissists, but then secondly, there's just something new  to replace something every day, all day, and there's nothing that...  Nothing can hold our attention.  I mean, I was very young, but I remember Watergate, and I remember that was it. 
[03:22:30]  That's all anybody talked about was Watergate, Watergate, and Watergate.  That's what happened.  That's what was happening.  Yeah, that's a good point.  I don't know if we're going to have that ability anymore.  September 11th is probably the closest thing.  Yeah, I mean, you're going to have to have something on that scale, and even then,  there's going to be a certain and a fairly large segment of society that's still getting 
[03:23:00]  caught up on Honey Boo Boo and doesn't give a shit about the tower and may not even know  about it.  And September 11th was also, you think about the time of 2001 as compared to the time now,  the Internet, the use of the Internet, the spread of information.  It wasn't even close to being the same thing.  Absolutely not.  Yeah.  Just the sheer volume of fucking stories that you get every day that you have to sift through.  Interesting, non-interesting, ridiculous, baffling, animal attacks, explosions, poisonings, 
[03:23:30]  oil leaks, Jesus fucking Christ.  Another plane crash, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  It never ends.  And I don't know, you know, I don't know how much of this we're geared to or supposed to  ingest and digest.  Like, I don't know, as human beings, I know we haven't changed biologically that much in  the past several hundred years, but yet things have changed a lot. 
[03:24:00]  Thousands of years.  We're very, very, very similar to the people that live 50,000 years ago.  Right.  But yet, you're holding a device in your hand that has more computing power than the  first Gemini rocket, you know, launch.  So, what are we supposed to do with that information?  And how are we supposed to process it?  And when does it become detrimental? 
[03:24:30]  Like, are we supposed to be somewhere processing information all the time?  I mean, I'll give you a, I was just saying this, but I found it sort of interesting.  I was doing this vintage car race.  So, I was out to dinner after the race with a guy who owns an airline, not a big one, like  a medium-sized one.  And I said, geez, man, what went on with that 777, a Malaysian plane, you know? 
[03:25:00]  Like, you own an airline.  What do you think?  And he said, yeah, I don't know.  And I said, can you just, can you dismantle or make those course transponders on the 777  is dysfunctional?  Can you just flip a switch or have to pull a fuse or breaker or something like that?  And he said, it was about 7 o'clock, we were just sitting there in some Mexican food joint 
[03:25:30]  outside of the track at Laguna Seca in Northern California.  And he said, hold on, let me hit my guy.  Now, his guy is, when you run an airline, you have to have like a chief engineer or something  like that, it basically tells you all the specs on the planes and the ins and outs and  how many hours engines have on them and what tires to get.  You've got to have a couple of those guys, right?  So, he said, let me hit my guy.  So, he just picked up his phone. 
[03:26:00]  You know, he didn't get up and leave or anything.  He just picked up his phone and he texted this dude, you know?  And now, I didn't think about it until later, but this was Saturday night at 730 at night.  Well, his dude is probably eating dinner with his family.  Maybe he's fucking his girlfriend.  Or maybe he's out to dinner with his wife.  But now his little device starts buzzing.  And his little device, it's the boss man on his device. 
[03:26:30]  He can't get back to him on Monday.  Anyway, the boss man just asked him a question.  And now, he's got to find out how you dismantle a beacon on a 777.  Now, I don't know if he knows it or he's got to go look it up.  But either way, if this guy's sitting with his kids or sitting with his wife or fucking his mistress,  he's got to go, oh, shit.  I've got to figure this shit out and give this guy an answer now because he's the boss. 
[03:27:00]  And he just asked me, fuck that it's Saturday night.  Right.  Fuck that it's the weekend and I'm with my family.  Uh-uh.  I've got to know.  And this guy probably had a little anxiety.  And this guy probably thought, eh, I'll get back to him Monday.  And then thought, oh, fuck.  I don't want to do that.  I better get back with him now.  He probably wants to know now.  And this guy probably had to get up and go somewhere, hop on a computer, do something, figure out the whatever. 
[03:27:30]  And then he had to go write this guy back on a Saturday night.  Well, that's how we're living now.  And I don't think it's good.  That aspect of it, I agree with you.  I think that's pretty rare.  I think also the amount of numbers that are coming in, I think we're eventually going to adapt.  I think human beings have a thing called Dunbar's number.  Are you aware of that?  You can only keep about 150 relationships, 150 friendships, 150 people you know by name and face.  After that, shit starts getting weird.  And I'm sure you've encountered that. 
[03:28:00]  You meet people and they go, hey, it was great when I met you before.  We had a good time, remember?  And you're like, what?  Sure.  I don't remember you.  There's no room.  You have no room in your hard drive.  Right.  Because we're not really designed to meet a million people over the course of a life, which you very well have probably met a million people.  The average person doesn't get to do that in a tribal situation 50,000 years ago.  We carry those same genetics today.  And I think that also applies to dealing with danger and the idea of hearing about news.  Because news and danger usually affects you. 
[03:28:30]  But when that news and danger is a plane halfway around the world, it becomes just sort of a weird, abstract thing.  And you're getting all these abstract, negative things that are happening all the time.  Every fucking point of the globe sends you its worst news.  Oh, we found a new serial killer who only eats babies.  Well, we found a fucking guy who's been living in the woods.  And, you know, we found this.  We found that.  Everything that's fucked up.  Everything terrible.  And it all comes into your head.  And you have to, at this point in our lives, you have to filter it. 
[03:29:00]  If you don't filter it, you will truly go insane.  Like, your biology can't manage it.  You're not designed for it.  It's not a normal thing.  It's not new.  And we haven't adapted yet.  So you better manage it.  You better, like, make a conscious decision to manage it.  Or it'll fucking move your life in the way it wants to.  It'll change your thought patterns.  Change your perceptions of the world.  And based on an insane number of 7 billion human beings' unusual events.  7 billion, which is 7,000 million human beings' problems. 
[03:29:30]  Right.  That's too many.  You're supposed to deal with 150.  That's why you have this number.  Right.  The Dunbar's number that's in your fucking head.  150.  That's it.  Not 7 billion.  That's fucking crazy.  So that change has been so radical and so quick, there's no way our biology right now  is caught up to it.  But I bet future generations will have some sort of an alteration in their ability to either  absorb massive amounts of information or some sort of a change in the way we process that 
[03:30:00]  information.  Right.  Right.  And we're just like the guinea pigs and we see how much medication and how much we can  all freak out over what's going on.  And it's true.  And I feel the same way.  I just feel inundated and overwhelmed and like there's so much coming at me at once constantly.  Well, if you think about language, when language burst onto the picture, when people started 
[03:30:30]  communicating with each other in recognizable sounds, almost immediately, people started  explaining their problems and all they started commiserating and started figuring each other  out.  And from there, from that point on, the world got way more complicated.  It wasn't just do what you feel and follow instincts and make grunts like where a tiger  is.  Like, you're actually communicating.  You're complaining.  You're whining.  You're expressing your fears for the future.  We have to create gods. 
[03:31:00]  We have to create the reason why the lightning comes down.  I mean, things like exponentially changed.  It wasn't like all of a sudden human beings were different.  No, human beings were the same.  But now all this new information is coming in.  And as they're developing this thing called language, I think we're at a very similar place  right now.  And the changes between us of today and what we will be a thousand years from now, we're  probably just as radical as the changes of non-speaking hominids to speaking hominids.  Well, that's very interesting. 
[03:31:30]  And I agree.  And I've always just thought about what are the long-term effects of sort of having everything  at your fingertips constantly.  You know, I always say, when I grew up and I wanted to see The Grinch That Stole Christmas,  that came on ABC at 8 o'clock on December 13th.  And you had to wait.  You could not see it before then.  And by the way, you couldn't see it after then either. 
[03:32:00]  If you were, you know, in the kitchen and the commercial break was over, you had to fucking  sprint your little jammies with the feet built in and slide across the floor to see it.  And it was a kind of a foreplay.  And now, if my kids want to see The Grinch That Stole Christmas, they can see it in July  on Blu-ray.  But I don't think it means shit to them.  Even better, they can see it on iTunes instantly on the iPad sitting in the living room.  Bip, bip, bip, boom.  It starts playing.  Or in the headrest of Mommy's SUV. 
[03:32:30]  Instantaneously.  Right.  Are they happier because of that?  I don't think they are.  If you were to ask me, would you like to see The Grinch That Stole Christmas whenever you  wanted in the headrest of Mommy's car?  I would have said yes.  But I don't think I would have been happier.  Because all it does is speed you up, changes your expectation level.  And then every once in a blue moon, when you don't get to see whatever it is you want  to see exactly the same time, I mean, then you're pissed off. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  And my kids are probably going to be walking around at age 25 going, hey man, I want to  see Fast and Furious 129.  And someone's going to go, well, it doesn't come out for four months.  Oh, that's such bullshit.  Fucking go get it, would you?  And put it in my box?  I want to watch it on my phone.  I want to watch it in my head.  I want to watch it in my head.  I just want to close my eyes.  And they go, it's not done.  Fuck that.  This is such bullshit. 
[03:33:30]  Have you seen this new story that came out today, the picture that Jamie put up earlier,  that by 2030, they're going to have mind-to-mind thought talking.  Wow.  And this is something that I've been bringing up for a while, that I think that human beings,  like the interface of sounds, like using sounds and even using language, is a temporary  thing.  I think that there's going to come a point in time where you're going to be able to read  like intent.  You're going to be able to, I'm going to be able to understand what's going on in your  head.  The same way you, when you have thoughts in your head, when you have ideas, you're not 
[03:34:00]  doing it with a language.  You're not, you're not expressing your thoughts to yourself with a language.  Very rarely do I say, well, it's about time to pull yourself by your bootstraps and get  back to work.  I just have a feeling in my head that represents those words.  And I've had that exact same thing happen to me during like heavy duty psychedelic experiences.  I've had something relay information to me in the form of intent instead of in words.  I think that ultimately, like in having experienced it in a psychedelic state, like on dimethyltryptamine 
[03:34:30]  or on mushrooms, I think that's probably what you would experience when they figure out this  sort of technology.  Like I'll be able to read your intent and it will be free of language.  Like your, the signals that are going on inside your mind, you'll be able to distribute those  to other people.  All right.  So do you know, do you know I have to piss really?  Go ahead and piss, man.  I'm kidding.  No, it's already, it's already incredibly interesting to me that you can take amputees 
[03:35:00]  that are cut off at the elbow, strap on, you know, robotic, prosthetic, whatever, and their  brain is able to tell it, you know, to pick up a grape lightly enough not to squash it or  pick up a pencil hard enough to hold it in their hand and which fingers and digits to move  just from the brain to a severed limb and get that thing to function. 
[03:35:30]  I mean, obviously that's your brain communicating with something without language.  And to me, the leap between making your brain communicate with animatronic digits that are  moving around and unscrewing mayonnaise jars or picking up pencils or holding your child,  that's not a very big leap.  Not at all.  To get from moving that hand around using your thought versus communicating that way. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, no, I agree.  I think it's just a matter of time.  Like this thing says, 20, 30, that sounds totally normal to me.  I mean, especially when you consider the exponential pace that these things improve in.  I was at a company in San Francisco for the sci-fi show that I did where we put on these  headgear and you control a remote-controlled helicopter with your mind, with your thoughts.  Like your intent moves this thing.  I was able to have it hover in the air for a little bit, but apparently once you get good  at it, you can actually move it down the hallway and park it someplace. 
[03:36:30]  I mean, it's fucking bananas.  You're piloting a really crude remote-controlled vehicle with your thoughts.  Right.  And this is a matter of time before they figure out how, you're going to have fucking robots  flying around your house, fetching you coffee.  You're going to look at your robot, your little flying fucking helicopter robot coffee maker,  and you're going to say, go make me some coffee, stupid.  And it's going to fly off and make you coffee and come back and give it to you.  You're going to be able to do all this with your mind.  You're not going to say it.  No, you're just going to think it. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  No, I mean, the drones are already stepping up.  A lot of it is computers versus batteries.  You know, it's batteries that were bricks just 10 years ago.  I mean, batteries were just huge bricks, and now they're the size of quarters,  and they're producing the same power because all this stuff needs to be propelled by something.  You know, there needs to be a system that powers it up.  And I know, even though it sounds corny, I used to fly remote-controlled airplanes, 
[03:37:30]  and they had electric ones, and the problem with the electric ones is the battery was literally a brick,  and it's hard to fly a little styrofoam plane with a brick in the middle of it.  And now most all of them are electric just because of the cell phone technology  and the battery that has been shrunk and lightened to the point where it's nothing anymore.  Yeah, it's amazing what they can do, too, with the algorithms that they have in their operating system for power management. 
[03:38:00]  Like, you could take an iPad, and you can watch five fucking movies on a flight, and it doesn't run out of juice.  Right.  You're watching a fairly big screen, and all these images are being processed.  It's constantly moving around.  You watch a whole fucking movie, and then you look at your battery, and it's, like, barely budged.  Like, this is incredible.  Well, because nothing, there are no more moving parts.  Yeah.  I mean, there used to be conveyor belts, and they're powered by rivers with wheels in them, 
[03:38:30]  and that took a lot of energy.  And now everything is digital, and there's no parts.  There's no friction.  There's no, you know, you don't realize.  Well, you probably realize, but, you know, whenever you talk about a car,  you talk about horsepower, you go, how much is it making to the crank?  And the guy goes, 500 horsepower.  And then you go, what's it making to the rear wheels?  And you go, oh, it's making about 430, 425, 430, right?  All right, that's not bad. 
[03:39:00]  Good.  Maybe we can get some synthetic oil in that rear end and get it up to 431 or whatever it is.  But you are scrubbing off all of that inertia and all of that torque and power  because it's having to pass through driveshafts and transmissions and differentials,  and it's scrubbing it off.  But if all that was digital, then you'd have 500 horsepower at the crank and 500 at the rear wheel.  And that's what we're getting now, the digital. 
[03:39:30]  Is that what they get with, like, Teslas?  Are they, like, is their horsepower at the engine the same as at the wheel?  Well, what they're getting and what they're doing now is it's all about torque,  and it's instant torque with electric motors, so they're getting that big.  That's why the Tesla 0 to 60 is not much off of, if not the same as your Porsche.  Now, your top speed in your Porsche is faster, but the 0 to 60, it's that kind of golf cart kind of thing. 
[03:40:00]  You ever get a golf cart and the guy hits it and you go flying off the back?  Yeah.  I mean, imagine a real car with four motors on all four wheels.  So you get the instant torque immediately.  But secondly, and I've not studied the Tesla that closely, but the motor is connected to the wheel.  There's no transmission that it's passing through, propeller shaft and differentials and things that are scrubbing off inertia. 
[03:40:30]  Have you fucked with those at all, Teslas?  I've drove, I just drove one around once, and they're quick.  Yeah.  I mean, they're super quick.  They're really, my friend Aubrey has one, and they have a laptop in the middle of it, like, essentially.  Yeah.  Like, it's huge, and he goes, we were going to this gym.  He goes, he said the name of the gym, navigate to, da-da-da, and it just takes you there.  And I'm like, this is fucking insane.  Yeah.  Like, it finds it on Google Maps, gives you the option, you press a button, and this huge navigation screen.  When you wanted to listen to music, he's like, play the doors. 
[03:41:00]  So all of a sudden, Spotify pulls up all these options for the doors, break on through to the other side, plus that one, boom, and it starts playing.  And it gets it all through the actual computer itself on the car, not even connected to your phone.  Right.  It's completely independent.  Right.  All of it uses some sort of a, unfortunately, 3G, not 4G, connection.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Um, this is going to be a rough transition, but seeing as now I have to go do my podcast pretty quick, on the topic of podcasts, you know, I'm being sued. 
[03:41:30]  Yes.  And, uh...  Explain that to people, because it's one of the dumbest fucking lawsuits I've ever heard in my life, but there's people that make a living off of these types of lawsuits, right?  Yeah, called patent trolls, that buy up patents, and they're lawyers, and it's sort of, I think it's this country at its worst.  I really do.  It's, they buy patents, and then they sue companies, saying they're using, stealing, or unlawfully using their technology. 
[03:42:00]  And sometimes, when you're buying technology, there's a real good argument to that.  Like, that technology is a part of this thing that you're selling, and without that technology, which is patented,  your technology, what you're selling, would not exist.  And I get that part.  Right.  And I support innovation, and people should be paid for intellectual property and creative ideas, but this is a weird one.  This is, what is the exact term that they have a patent on? 
[03:42:30]  The exact...  They have a patent on a playlist.  Yes.  Online.  Anything in a serial order, right?  Right.  Like, even blogs.  Evidently, anything that comes out on a Monday, and then the next one comes out on a Tuesday,  or this song is above that song, and this song's number three, and that song's number seven,  that's what they claim to have dominion over.  So if you have a blog, and you enter into that blog, like, you know, blog entry number one, 
[03:43:00]  you know, Adam goes to do podcasts to talk about this lawsuit, they could sue you for that.  Like, they own a piece of that, a serialized message that you're putting on a website.  Yes.  Numbered message.  That's correct.  That's insane.  Well, it is insane, because if it's true, then really everything on the Internet's got to go away.  Everything.  Could you imagine if they bought up everything on the Internet with one sneaky move?  Like, one sneaky move, one patent. 
[03:43:30]  What if the judge says, look, the guy's got a point.  He owns everything in serialized form.  Well, the problem is, is I don't think the judge or the jury is going to think they have a point.  Unfortunately, in order to make our point that they don't have a point, it's going to cost $1.5 million.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  That's what patent litigation costs.  That's what the legal fees are going to be?  That's what I've been quoted. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, my God.  I've been quoted 1.25 to 1.5.  Wow.  Yeah, I know.  That's stunning.  I never would have thought it would be that high.  Lawyers get paid a lot.  So is that what it is?  It's all the lawyers?  That's what it is.  It's all the lawyers.  How much work do they have to do here?  Joe, for me, it's like, first off, I've spent $50,000 trying to get a change of fucking venue.  These guys are in eastern Texas. 
[03:44:30]  That's where they set up.  Because eastern Texas is famous for...  Friendly to their types of folk.  Yeah, to this type of thing, patent troll lawsuits.  I don't live in eastern Texas, and my business isn't in eastern Texas.  And they don't live in eastern Texas either.  That's just where they hung their shingle.  And they hung their shingle specifically because this is a place that's advantageous to do things like this.  Well, it's what you would do if you were a company that bought up other people's technology 
[03:45:00]  and then tried to sue other businesses and make money off of them.  You're going to maximize the possibility of you getting an outcome that's in your favor,  and you'll do it on the moon if you have to.  Now, if these people come to you with some sort of a settlement,  like if they said, hey, you're using our technology, we would like $5 a month,  like anything along those lines?  Yes, $3 million.  Whoa. 
[03:45:30]  And this is because they've won these before, the same company.  They got $8 million from Apple, right?  Yeah.  It's unclear what I'm doing with them and what they're doing with me,  but it's a pretty simple equation, which is I just said, look, all the guys in podcasting  need to kind of band together, and we need to fight them, and then we need to beat them,  and then once we beat them, then they're beat because they can't go after you or Marc Maron or whoever 
[03:46:00]  once we beat them.  But if we allow this to just go away, it's not going to.  If we say, well, let's just put it aside and fucking ignore them, then they win.  I mean, it's a possibility that they could win.  There's no way.  Look, when you get sued, you get sued.  You've got to respond.  But let's just say we said, look, you guys obviously haven't done the math on our company, 
[03:46:30]  but it's a business.  No one wants to spend the time and the $1 million-plus to fight this thing.  Take $350,000 and please go away, or $500,000, or $100,000, whatever it is.  Well, how long before they go to iTunes and they go, let's see who else is doing okay over here on iTunes?  Well, look at Joe Rogan. 
[03:47:00]  He's doing all right.  Now, last time we did this with Corolla, we got $500,000 out of him.  I wonder what Joe's good for.  And all we've got to do is do the same thing we did with Corolla.  He knows.  I mean, we'll let Joe's attorneys coach him up, but they're going to tell you this is the most expensive kind of litigation.  It's going to cost over a million dollars.  I mean, he can go on the Internet and look that up in five minutes.  Do you know who these human beings are behind this?  Do you know the actual human beings?  Are you aware of names or faces? 
[03:47:30]  Do you know what they look like?  No, I don't.  And I never think that way.  I just think I understand that we live in a world that is generally decent and that these people probably think of themselves as generally decent.  You know, they probably have kids that love them and a wife that gives them a blowjob on occasion.  This is what they do for a living.  When a guy works at a used RV lot and he's got an RV on that lot that's worth $4,000 and some elderly couple comes in there and he gets them for $20,000, he doesn't go home and stare in the mirror and go, wow, I'm a really bad human being. 
[03:48:00]  He goes, I'm a fucking great salesman.  And I think that's what these guys do.  I don't even fault them on a personal level.  Like, they make money from doing this.  I understand it.  It's not even worth trying to make it a personal issue. 
[03:48:30]  I don't feel it's a personal issue.  They saw my podcast.  I'm actually, in a bizarre way, flattered.  They saw my podcast and said, that guy's really doing well for himself.  I can't believe they wanted $3 million.  That's insane.  That was their first offering.  That's stunning.  What we're doing is we're getting everyone together and we're going to show them that the podcast community is a lot stronger than they thought, that they fucked with the wrong people. 
[03:49:00]  And I don't mean me.  I mean everybody.  And that whether you're a Joe Rogan fan or Adam Carolla fan or an NPR fan, it's all going away if we don't buck up and beat these guys.  So we just went to fund anything, .com forward slash patent troll, and you can give toward the legal defense fund.  And that's where the money's going.  There's a video up there to watch where Adam explains the whole situation and what's going on. 
[03:49:30]  And spread this.  Spread it on Twitter.  Spread it on Facebook.  Let everybody know.  If you can't donate, at least spread the word and let people know what the fuck is going on.  Because, yeah, this is a crazy thing.  This is a weird byproduct of our society.  Right.  I don't like it, but there's nothing we can do about it at this point in time.  No, other than this.  Other than this.  But this is really cool because this could be a seminal moment for podcasting, which is you guys fucked with the wrong guys. 
[03:50:00]  We're all grassroots, but we all band together.  We all got our little individual little armies, and we all got them united, and we all fought this common cause.  You know what I love about podcasting?  That I do think that that's something that fits with the ethic of podcasting.  But I also love that podcasting isn't a competitive thing in that everybody supports everybody else in podcasting.  I've never heard of podcast feuds.  No.  Like morning DJ guys always fucking hate the other morning DJ guy. 
[03:50:30]  Right.  And they always talk shit about them.  But podcasts, I don't know anybody who says, like, you know, oh, we would be fucking doing great if it wasn't for that Adam Carolla show.  Everybody's watching that stupid.  That show sucks.  Our podcast is the future.  That show's for old people.  Fuck up.  You know, it doesn't seem to be going on at all.  I think the attitude of the Internet is that you're dealing with the world.  You're dealing with an infinite amount of people.  It's so goddamn big that having that sort of famine mentality that a lot of people have if they are in morning radio in a specific city, you don't need it in the Internet. 
[03:51:00]  No, listen, every, I feel like the last podcast I did yesterday, Jay Moore and Joe Coy, and they both have podcasts.  Eighty percent of the guests on my show have their own podcast, and we promote their podcasts on my podcast.  Yes.  So that's all you need to know, right?  We do the exact same thing, and I'm always telling people, you should do a podcast. 
[03:51:30]  Like, people that are good guests, I'm like, why don't you do your own podcast?  You don't even need a place like this.  You need a fucking MP3 recorder and a microphone.  That's it.  Right.  Upload it online.  It takes 10 seconds, and boom, you have a fucking podcast.  Well, the plan is podcasters unite, rally your army, and let's beat these guys.  Let's do it.  We're in.  We're in 1,000%.  That's not even a real number.  It's only 100%.  It's possible.  But we're in that.  But we'll say 1,000.  I like your hyperbole, Joe. 
[03:52:00]  I like that you like it.  So funanything.com forward slash patent troll.  Please go there.  If you can't donate, please spread the word so that other people can find out about it  that can donate.  I get it if you're broke.  I totally understand it.  But if you do appreciate podcasting and you do appreciate Adam's show and his network,  and he's got a whole network, and then on top of that, everybody else that you know that  does podcasts, whether it's Joey Diaz or Ari Shafir or Duncan Trussell, Adam's right.  That would all go away if it wasn't for, you know, if we can't figure out a way around 
[03:52:30]  this issue.  Absolutely.  Do it.  Do it, ladies and gentlemen.  Adam, I just want to tell you that you are one of the reasons why I did this in the first  place.  I loved watching you do it and go from regular radio.  And I remember doing the first ones when it was on the couch and you had the clip-on  microphones and the whole deal.  I was like, wow, he's got kind of a cool setup here.  And that was part of what spun the wheels for me to get into this in the first place.  When you were podcasting, what year did you start? 
[03:53:00]  Beginning of 2009.  Yeah.  So I was around slightly after you, slightly after you.  But you were...  Listen, I'm flattered and you can come on out and see the new digs whenever you like.  Did you change anything?  Are you even bigger or better now?  Always working on the studio, always trying to improve and always trying to kind of build  the business, you know?  Well, it's very cool.  It's very cool that it's working.  It's very cool to be a part of all this.  The podcasting community is a great supportive community. 
[03:53:30]  And what you were talking about, about having people on your show that have their own podcasts  and promoting their podcasts, I think it's one of the coolest things about this business.  It really is.  Thanks, Joe.  I appreciate it.  This has been the Joe Rogan Experience.  Expand further into the Rogan Universe at JoeRogan.net.
