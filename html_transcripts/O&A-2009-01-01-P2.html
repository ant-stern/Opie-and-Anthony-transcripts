<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with E-Rock and Sam Roberts hosting a "Worst of 2008 Cringiest Moments" segment, focusing heavily on Opie's past performances as the "Spuds Buckley" character.  Opie recounted embarrassing anecdotes from his Spuds Buckley days, including tearful episodes in his car and his general manager's office to avoid being fired.  Audio clips of the Spuds Buckley character were played.  This was followed by a listener call-in segment and a stunt where hot candle wax was poured onto E-Rock's body, his reactions and the hosts’ commentary comprising the segment.

The show then shifted to the ongoing saga of Anthony Cumia and Jill Nicolini ("Anthelini").  A phone call with Jill, expressing her interest in dating Anthony, and featuring Mick Foley in studio, was played.  The hosts discussed Anthony’s subsequent absence from work after a 20-22 hour first date with Jill, punctuated by Anthony’s evasive answers about the date's specifics (e.g., whether they held hands or slept).  Anthony’s need to neuter his cats was humorously mentioned in the context of a post-date hangover.  A significant portion detailed the fallout between Anthony and Jill, resulting in a “hostage exchange” orchestrated by Anthony's manservant, Keith.  Jill had seized some of Anthony's belongings and demanded a escalating sum, eventually reaching $1000, for their return. This included a bizarre request for a large cement cowboy boot.  Further accusations emerged, including Jill allegedly burning items belonging to another woman at Anthony's house, burning a birth certificate and her grandfather's ashes, and potentially damaging Anthony's car.  Keith provided detailed accounts of this bizarre transaction. The hosts and Keith reacted with disbelief and humor to the increasingly strange narrative.

A subsequent segment, possibly with Primetime Sam Roberts and Derek, revisited the "Anthelini saga," focusing on emails from Jill's friend detailing Jill’s perspective and alleging Anthony's infidelity.  Anthony vehemently defended himself on air, refuting the claims.  The emails detailed accusations and counter-accusations including financial disputes (the $1000 exchange and dry cleaning bills), the burning of clothes, and the accidental incineration of Jill's grandfather's ashes.  Anthony also countered with details of expensive gifts he bought for Jill, including $280 flip-flops and $4000 worth of blinds.  A graphic description of a grease stain on Anthony's bed sheets, allegedly from Jill's medication, was included.  Anthony expressed intense anger towards Gene Simmons for allegedly sleeping with Jill and harassing her at Channel 11. The segment included heavy use of vulgar and offensive language.

The show further amplified their anger towards Gene Simmons, using highly offensive and graphic language to describe his appearance and sexual performance.  They repeatedly demanded Simmons' return for a confrontation.  A segment on "worst of 2008 cringe moments" followed, including a recounting of the Gene Simmons incident, the burning down of Anthony's favorite restaurant, Mio's, and a planned "franchise" version of the show to handle an interview with David Tyree.  Comedian Bobby Lee, a guest, experienced a panic attack on air, possibly triggered by the show's antics, technical difficulties, and his own anxieties, and abruptly left, believing a hidden bunny rabbit prank was underway.

An in-studio interview with David Tyree followed, promoting his book "More Than Just the Catch."  Tyree discussed his life, struggles with drugs and alcohol, his arrest for marijuana possession, his finding of faith, the "Helmet Catch," his knee injury, his relationship with former teammates (criticizing Tiki Barber), and his admiration for Jerry Rice.  A Jets fan caller accused Opie of hypocrisy.  The conversation veered into *Back to the Future*, with further calls, including a prank call and playful banter with Tyree.  Anthony requested a photo, and they briefly discussed Tyree's book sales.

The second half of this segment then revisited the "cringiest moments" of 2008, culminating in the "Baby Diaper Mustache" stunt.  This involved Opie wearing a mustache made of baby feces brought to the studio by Rich Voss, with graphic descriptions of the texture, smell, and color of the feces and the resulting reactions of Opie, Bobby Kelly (who vomited repeatedly), and the hosts.  E-Rock and Sam Roberts then discussed other cringe-worthy moments, such as a Seth Green visit and an interaction between Green and Sam's girlfriend, and descriptions of E-Rock's girlfriend.

An interview with Seth Green followed, initially hampered by the hosts' self-deprecating comments about their interviewing skills.  They discussed Green's career, anecdotes about meeting celebrities, and played clips, including a rambling fan question about Jimmy Kimmel wearing a dress and a clip highlighting Gene Simmons’ son playfully ribbing his father.  This was followed by a bizarre and disgusting tongue-scraping challenge with several studio guests, resulting in vomiting, concluding with promotions for upcoming events and the show.  The entire segment was punctuated by crude humor and offensive language.

[00:09:00]  Hello.  All the new suckers.  Joining us after turning on their new XM and Sirius radios.  Describe the show a bit.  Well, it's a little bit of this, and then we do a little of that.  And we throw in some la-la-la-las.  Thanks for checking us out.  This is The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  See, this describes it better.  Just play this.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  It's The Worst of Opie and Anthony, 2008 Cringiest Moments.  I am E-Rock, and joining me is primetime Sam Roberts.  Yes, Sam here from The Opie and Anthony Show, as is E-Rock.  And we are going down some of the cringiest moments in 2008.  And what that basically means is the moments on The Opie and Anthony Show that made you cringe the most.  And what are we starting off with?  Well, E-Rock, Opie had a radio career before he was Opie.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  Really? 
[00:10:00]  Quite a varied one.  And in 2008, we met Spuds Buckley.  And for the first time, he played the bit in its entirety.  This is Opie debuting the entire Spuds Buckley tape in front of Anthony, Jim, and the radio audience.  Was it good?  It was great.  And that's what I cringed at.  All right.  How good is it?  I'll take your word for it.  Let's listen to it.  It's Spuds Buckley on The Worst of Opie and Anthony's 2008 Cringiest Moments.  It's Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2008 Cringiest Moments. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  I'll look back at some of the most uncomfortable yet hilarious portions of the show.  Three, two, Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  It's Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2008 Cringiest Moments.  Happy New Year.  Way before Anthony and I did our famous April Fool's prank that got us fired the first time.  Oh.  My second radio, by the way.  Mm. 
[00:11:00]  Because we all got fired when we were working in Buffalo back in the day because they, you  know, were bought out.  But anyway.  Spuds Buckley didn't save the day?  No.  There was a morning show, The Bear Man.  He's now heard in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Morning, Bear Man.  And his April Fool's prank was to come up with a parade.  And then people would call the station like, wow, where's this parade?  It sounds cool.  I want to check it out with my kids.  Well, the gag is there was never a parade. 
[00:11:30]  But it sounded like there was an actual parade going through Buffalo.  And I was part of that bit that day.  Ooh.  As Spuds Buckley.  The Spuds Buckley's home of quality.  Rock and Rolls.  636.  Gracious.  Good morning.  You're on your way with The Bear Man.  We've got the Bullsecks crew.  We're here at the, excuse me, at the reviewing stand for the first annual Fox Fool's Parade.  We're located just one half mile west of Furman Boulevard near Shooters.  And they're still working on the kittens.  So you get the location and all of a sudden people show up and are like, hey, where's the parade? 
[00:12:00]  And there's sound effects like they're building a reviewing stand or something.  Is that what they're doing?  Or a float?  What are they building?  Yeah.  As you're on it.  What is this?  Animal House?  Yeah, what is the hammering in the background?  Unless it's Spuds Buckley's head.  We're creating an illusion.  Spud Buckley's stink.  All you need is a hammer sound, you know, hammering a nail in and you create an illusion.  An illusion.  Yes.  Theater of the mind.  That's right. 
[00:12:30]  Furman Boulevard near Shooters.  And they're still working on getting some of the barriers.  Some of these vendors we got over here, they want to know where the hell they're supposed  to be.  Vendors, vendors, vendors, vendors.  Who's, where's those?  Let's look at the big, well.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  All right.  Listen.  I was like, no, no, no.  You got it.  You got it.  I can't.  Please stop.  You got it.  I can't.  Yeah, I know.  Please.  I won.  Please.  Bobby, yes.  Just relish in it.  Please.  Please.  I can't.  Opie, for the love of everything, that's all.  He pushed that button.  What happened?  That was, you heard two seconds of Spuds Buckley, and now you just want to hear as much as you 
[00:13:00]  can.  You haven't heard Spuds Buckley yet?  No, but did he have a hat with a propeller on top?  See?  It was that type of character.  I didn't, I didn't create this character be, like, cool.  Oh.  It wasn't getting me the Buffalo Bettys.  You were like the nutty professor.  Like, one guy was like, la, la, la, la, and then the other one was Buddy Love, the crooner. 
[00:13:30]  You had buck teeth in your pocket and Chinese, like, Asian guy glasses?  Dude, I'm like, nah, let me tell you something.  I would do a lot of stuff out in the streets, and I was too poor to get the proper outfit  for Spuds Buckley.  So I would just, like, come up with stuff.  I have sweatpants, you know, and white basketball sneakers, and the sweatpants are tucked into  the white socks that are pulled up pretty high. 
[00:14:00]  And then I got the station jacket on, because it is Buffalo, and I'm freezing my ass off.  And then I have, like, a do-rag on.  And are you making a la, la, la, la, la, la face?  No, I'm just, I'm doing a what's up, man, face.  Oh, my God.  All right, let's play this.  Two Swerzo.  What's it going to be?  Well, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, no, no.  Good morning, Bear Man.  Ladies and gentlemen, put them together for Spuds Buckley.  Put them together. 
[00:14:30]  Two mallets with his head between it.  You have to stop.  My ears almost fell off.  The two shivers just went up my back.  It almost shook my ears off.  Right?  Yeah.  I, uh, you've got to remember, I was making 12 Gs.  This is, I'm being polite.  12 large, huh?  I'm being polite.  This was at least 15 years ago.  No, about 15 years ago.  You should have been making Governor Spitzer prostitute money to degrade yourself like that.  Uh, and I actually, uh, was, well, I told the story. 
[00:15:00]  I was supposed to show up at a really nice outdoor, like, uh, club in Buffalo at Spuds  Buckley, and I'm there, and there's all these, like, you know, these hot chicks and guys  trying to pick up the hot chicks, and then I was supposed to be, like, the entertainment  and do a couple things and sell some beers, and I sat in my car and basically cried and  said, I can't do this.  Cried.  I can't do this.  Dude, I have suffered in this business. 
[00:15:30]  And I never showed up, and it was a big client.  I believe it was, like, Budweiser or something.  I mean, it was a huge client, and I almost got fired, and then I actually, I actually did  cry in the general manager's office.  I'm like, look.  Oh, my God.  You can't fire me.  I just couldn't do this.  I was, I was mortified.  You had a life-changing moment in the car.  In the car.  As Spuds Buckley.  In my Honda Accord that had close to 200,000 miles on it.  Did you go home?  In the parking lot of this really hip club that I was supposed to, like, make this big 
[00:16:00]  appearance at Spuds Buckley.  Did you go home that night and take the outfit off and fold it up and put it in a suitcase  and put it up on the top shelf of a closet?  I think that's how this whole character ended.  I don't think I did it after that.  It just kind of petered out?  Because the salespeople, they'll sell anything.  They're like, oh, this Spuds Buckley character.  Apparently.  We got to have them doing appearances all over Buffalo.  And the first one, I sat in the parking lot with my dumb, awful outfit that I had next  to me on the passenger seat, and I'm like, I can't do this. 
[00:16:30]  I will not do this.  And I'm pounding the steering wheel.  My life sucks.  I'm 400 miles away from home trying to make something of myself in radio.  And then it got back to the GM.  I didn't show up, and rumor had it that he was just going to fire me flat out, and I  actually had to let the tears flow to make sure I didn't get fired.  You used the bitch get out of a ticket strategy.  Hell yeah, man.  Not only did I not get fired, I got a raise.  You got a raise?  Yeah, because I told him how down on my luck I was, making no money far from home. 
[00:17:00]  I was collecting change to eat.  But anyway.  I don't like that he's pulling on a heartstring.  I know.  He's trying to get some sympathy now.  He's giving you some background on this dumb thing.  I don't care if you cried in your car, and you couldn't eat, and you had to go down on  people to get a meal.  You did spuds.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Good morning, baby, man. 
[00:17:30]  Do you want to hear more or what?  Come on.  Not only do I want to hear more, I have to.  All right.  Here we go.  I'm here to make a buck this morning.  Spuds, when aren't you here to make a buck, huh?  Hey.  So do you have your vendor permit?  Uh, yeah.  All right.  I'll trust you, okay?  Okay.  Now, you're going to be vending up and down the parade route today?  I'm going to be selling fudgy-wudgy bars this morning.  Oh, Bobby's leaving.  Bobby just got up. 
[00:18:00]  Bobby!  He's physically leaving.  Bobby!  Bobby just left.  That means we can't play anymore, I guess.  He's leaving.  Too bad.  I was willing to give you another 30 seconds today.  And he left.  He left his studio, and I can't.  I need to hear more, because like I said, I want new spuds, Buckley.  Everything so far, I've heard already.  I need just something a little new.  Well.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I had to go punch something.  Bobby, why do you think I'm like the biggest dick? 
[00:18:30]  Because I've been through the freaking ringer in this business.  Oh, wait a minute.  E-Rock's got a spuds, Buckley song?  What?  We represent the lollipop cheer, the lollipop cheer, the lollipop cheer.  Wow.  Sounds just like him.  Yeah, you might laugh, but you know, I was the inspiration for it.  Spongebob Squarepants.  That is true.  Yes, Drew.  I could have been making Spongebob Squarepants money.  You've got to play some more.  I need new spuds, Buckley, for the next break. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  See?  Just in case you thought I was lying, listen to this.  Uh-oh.  Many years later, this is what was going on in pop culture.  I was on to something, my friends.  Yeah, you were on.  La-la-la-la.  La-la-la-la-la.  See?  That's from Spongebob Squarepants.  Yeah.  I was on to something.  Yeah, you were.  About 10 years later, all of a sudden, they're ripping off Spuds Buckley.  Where's my residuals?  I need residuals.  Why do you think I'm a dick, dude? 
[00:19:30]  I've done it all in this business.  Ant knows.  I freaking had to sit on the side of the Long Island Expressway at a gas station pumping  a dollar two gas and handing roses to fatties for Valentine's Day.  I've done it all.  I've had it.  I've done the Jell-O wrestling in parking lots and stupid kiddie pools.  This is such a back story of how Opie became Opie.  Absolutely. 
[00:20:00]  And I was the guy, oh, you don't mind.  Let him work every holiday.  Oh, God, that's why I'm a dick, if you really want to get into it.  I've seen it all, my friend.  Get into it.  I had to do two for Tuesdays, and I had to get the lead out.  And I did Mandatory Metallica, and I did the four-play weekend where the fourth cut is always live.  That was me.  Of course it is.  Who do you think was spinning the tunes for your block party weekend?  Me!  Who ran the 5 o'clock funnies? 
[00:20:30]  Me!  5 o'clock, I've done those.  Freeway jam?  Yeah, the 5 o'clock traffic jam.  Traffic jam, yeah.  Well, you get some jamming tunes.  That was me, Bob!  He's having a nervous breakdown.  That's why I'm a dick.  Let's go to Jason in Carolina.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, poor Opie, he's gone through all this radio hell, and what was he doing a week ago?  Rubbing baby crap under his nose.  He's nothing changed for you, man.  Nah, that's true. 
[00:21:00]  You're right.  I'm still Spongebuckly deep down.  I'll always be him.  It's okay, Opie, relax.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It was just the beginning.  It was the way you got into, you know, the business.  Who do you think played the songs when we did the 9 to 5 promotion?  Listen to a song in the 9 o'clock hour.  Listen to one in the 2 o'clock hour.  Listen to the one in the 5 o'clock hour.  Be the 10th caller. 
[00:21:30]  And you win this crappy prize.  That was me!  I'm scared.  Very.  Done every dumb promotion available.  Very frightening.  Very frightening.  We still love you, though.  He's nervous.  Who started Led Zeppelin A to Z?  I started with the first song.  The Firecracker 500.  That was me!  Firecracker 500.  That's 4th of July, or weekend, right?  Yeah!  Yeah.  Who do you think had a sleep at the radio station the 4th of July weekend? 
[00:22:00]  Me!  While you're out there barbecuing and drinking and picking up broads.  I had to make believe this Firecracker 500 thing was important.  Oh, guess what the number one song of all time is going to be?  Oh, is it going to be Stairway to Heaven?  Oh, maybe it'll be Freebird this time around.  That was me!  I had to make believe it mattered.  Oh, he's throwing things.  He's all angry.  He's not even throwing things that won't hurt. 
[00:22:30]  He threw a coffee mug.  Oh, Jesus.  Big, heavy Starbucks one.  It's a big, heavy Starbucks.  Who threw that?  Who had to deliver the big six-foot heroes and the pizza to the office parks?  I actually did that.  I remember that.  I did that at BAB where I thought I was actually, you know,  finally doing something with my career.  And, like, one of my jobs was I had to, like, get the six-foot hero and go to an office park in the middle of nowhere.  And all of a sudden I'm in this office and no one gives a crap. 
[00:23:00]  They just want the free sub.  No one knew who I was.  And I'm handing out T-shirts and ice scrapers.  And I see a kid I graduate with, and he's like, why are you bringing me lunch?  And I'm like, oh, yeah, that's me.  Remember when I had this dream of going into broadcasting when we were in history class together?  Well, this is what it's become ten years later.  Well, like the guy said, though, I mean, you did make it.  You're on a great hit show.  Well, not back then. 
[00:23:30]  Well, right now, though, you made it.  It's just embarrassing back then.  Yeah.  Actually, you know it wasn't.  It was actually cool.  Honey, guess what I did today?  I went down to this big office park, and I brought ice scrapers,  and everybody was glad to see me because it was icy out.  Because it was icy out.  I brought a sandwich, and it was great because everyone was kind of hungry.  Dude, there was a crowd, and I just threw T-shirts into them.  It was nuts.  They were going nuts.  And I'd wait, and then I'd throw it, and they'd go.  Oh, they love me.  Oh, they love me, man.  The guy gave me his card. 
[00:24:00]  He gave me his card.  He told me to give him a call.  He might want me to promote something as Spuds Buckley.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Let me say hi to Lydia from Oceanside.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Lydia.  You know, last time I spoke to you, you said you would never ever see a therapist,  but I hear so much anguish in your voice about your past.  I wonder if you wouldn't reconsider.  So you think I need a therapist?  I'm just suggesting that, you know. 
[00:24:30]  Well, I think you need a big black dick up your ass.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  What's going on?  I certainly hope someone's being attentive.  I certainly hope someone's being attentive down the hall.  Opie certainly gave her a fine how-do-you-do.  Wow.  Jeez.  Where are we?  Uh, yeah.  Anthony, where are we?  Frequency modulation, Opie.  We are on frequency modulation.  Oh! 
[00:25:00]  You must wait until this signal is beamed into outer space.  Yeah.  And returns back to Earth, cleansed in the atmosphere.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments.  It's time for hot candle wax shots.  Yes.  Now, I asked Dave on Saturday, or was it Friday, I guess?  Yeah, Friday.  Well, into Saturday.  I go, Dave, you want to take a hot candle wax shot?  He goes, yeah, no problem.  And I'm thinking, eh, maybe his belly or his arm, he pulls his pants down and insisted that he gets it in the crack of his butt. 
[00:25:30]  And then he proceeded, even though he was really hammered, to scream bloody murder, frightening the people trying to enjoy their fine food at F.H. Riley's.  As we laughed and laughed.  Fell on the floor laughing.  Yeah.  Because then he had dried wax up and down his butt.  He couldn't get rid of it.  It was on his pants.  It was all in his underwear.  It was just a mess.  So, E-Rock, would you take a shot of hot candle wax today? 
[00:26:00]  We've been burning candles all morning.  Sure.  There's three hours of wax in there.  I think it should go right on his belly.  Yeah.  Like, lift the shirt up and then just splash it.  Yeah.  Right onto his belly.  How about his bag?  Jimmy, would you do the honors?  No.  Because if there's a problem.  Why would there be a problem?  If he gets burned?  We're throwing scalding liquid on somebody.  Well, waxes, you know.  That's true.  I don't know.  You won't sue us, right?  We've got to get the, you have to, like, vocalize. 
[00:26:30]  You won't sue us.  No, I won't sue you.  There you go.  Well, good.  Give me a mic.  Mike, you're safe.  Give me an effing candle.  Thank you.  I'll do it.  You'll do it?  Sure, why not?  Don't miss.  Get a good one.  All right.  We've got to get a mic on, E-Rock.  Do you want to start with, like, small?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, E-Rock, by the way, I forgot to tell you, all three of us get to do it.  I'll pick the belly.  All right.  Like, I have multiple bellies?  Yes.  Why would that make you?  That's as smart as you do.  You want a mirror? 
[00:27:00]  Is this a good one?  We've got a solid shot to shot and a half of hot wax waiting to be thrown on E-Rock.  Nice.  All right, here we go.  Lie on your back, E-Rock.  Is that mic on, Steve?  Testing.  Okay.  No, he doesn't lie on his back.  He just throw it right at him.  No, you're lying on his back, so you're dripping on him.  No, he ain't dripping on him.  It's one of these quick, it's got to be like a quick just blast, the whole thing, right  on his gut.  Here we go.  E-Rock, take your shirt off.  Hey, take your shirt off, Hammer. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  Here he goes.  That's nice.  Yeah.  You know what?  We're kind of ready.  Yeah.  Hot.  He's got big pink nips.  Hunk of the day.  Come, yeah, get over here.  Make sure it don't, no splatter.  Here we go.  Oh, you should dump it on him because that way it doesn't come off.  Oh, it'll stay.  Okay.  Yeah, this will be ridiculous.  All right.  Close your eyes, E-Rock.  Oh.  Oh.  There's a little delayed reaction. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, ew.  That's what he usually says.  You got him right in the belly button.  It went, I saw it go in his belly button.  It went in his belly button.  Is it turning red yet?  Because it will turn all red and nasty.  And then it looks like you might have, you know.  Yeah, exactly.  We did flakes.  We did flakes.  How did it feel, E-Rock? 
[00:28:30]  Let's see.  It's turning red.  Yep.  I love E-Rock.  It didn't feel it at first, but as it started to leak into my belly button, it started to burn.  Nice.  Give me one.  I want to hit his back with it.  All right.  It gets to do a...  No, see, the splash is the best part.  You don't drip it.  You just have to...  I just didn't want it all wasted.  I wanted it to go out.  Oh, no, no, no.  Sure.  You could have dumped it on him, like Lane dumped it on him.  I wanted it all dumped on him.  What's going on, E-Rock? 
[00:29:00]  Looks like I had an accident.  Wow.  The front of your pants.  Looks like you just saw a cheesecake.  All right.  Hold on, E-Rock.  Get ready for the second shot.  Thanks, buddy.  Oh, that's going to be an awful one.  All right.  E-Rock's not going to be able to see it coming.  Ah!  I did, like, a slow-train thing, so most of it would end up...  Ah!  Look at his back.  That's all driven.  Wow.  It looks like...  Yes, it does. 
[00:29:30]  Yes.  Oh, if that doesn't look like you're in a bathhouse.  Yes.  E-Rock, can I throw one, like...  It's all sticky.  E-Rock, can I...  Is it?  Well...  E-Rock, can I throw one on your throat?  How about a down-the-crack one?  How about me and Jimmy at the same time?  We have two left.  How about down-the-crack?  Yeah, can we do a crack and a...  Yeah, one in the front, one in the back.  Oh, my God.  Look at how red his belly is.  All right, give me one more, Dan.  I think he took skin off. 
[00:30:00]  No.  That's his belly button gunk.  Way to do, Ray.  He's got yours.  Let's see your back.  I want to see how red...  Oh, yeah, that one got really red.  Where, um...  The best thing I've noticed, it's better instead of doing the wind-up, because believe it or  not, from the time it leaves the glass to the time it hits him, if you're a distance  away, it has time to cool.  So if you just kind of...  Jimmy, pull it...  It's a throw pour, almost.  Pull his pants out.  Pull his pants out.  And then pour it down. 
[00:30:30]  And pour it down.  He opens them up a little bit from the back.  Yeah, yeah, open up your belt.  Could we do a double to your, uh...  Get in your mic.  All right, let's hold it to you.  And then right down there.  Um...  Oh, boy.  This is going to be bad.  Hold on.  No, you're right.  You got to bend forward.  Yeah, bend forward.  You got to bend forward.  Slide your jeans down.  All right, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, get on the other side.  And tell us when.  Well, get...  Hold on, sir.  Get so you get a better view.  Point us for the wind.  All right, let's see.  Hold on, hold on.  We're getting the cameras.  Everyone's in my way.  I can't see.  Thanks.  Okay, and go. 
[00:31:00]  Did he curse?  Yes.  He dropped the F-bomb.  Oh, man.  That looked like a hurt.  And then he did, like, a cartoon run.  Like, on a cartoon character, there's butts on fire. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, man.  What's the matter, Iraq?  How's it feel?  It's like I wet my pants.  Wait a minute.  That does hurt.  He jumped.  Would you get some on you?  I just dumped it in my palm to see how it feels.  That does hurt.  There are guys that have a sexual fetish for that, where they want it, like, on their nipples  and on their penis.  They want hot wax drip.  I don't get it.  I know.  Iraq has the biggest crack, and we both just poured it right down the crack. 
[00:32:00]  He's going into the bathroom to tidy up the walk of degradation into the bathroom.  Oh, is that good?  Wow.  Too damn funny.  Oh, Iraq is a trooper, man.  He will do anything.  Iraq is the best.  Iraq, come on out, because we've got to end the show.  Watch.  All right, well.  Huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Another.  Iraq.  No, it'll. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, yeah, no, it worked.  The handle worked.  How does it feel, Iraq?  Oh.  Look at his underwear.  They're all, it's covered.  Covered in wax where his crack would be.  Oh, God.  Oh, what a mess you are.  It looks like I dumped frosting.  How did it feel?  It's still, like, it's pulling hair.  Yeah, your skin's not stuck. 
[00:33:00]  Your skin's not as red, though.  You'll be all right.  Wax is actually not that bad for you.  People get dipped in wax.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Very good, Iraq.  Iraq.  You never disappoint, ever.  Ever, ever, ever.  We'll play the theme song to end the show.  Oh, what a way to end it.  Yeah, well.  That was good.  Oh, you know, Rob from Rhode Island makes a very good point.  Rob.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Rob.  Hi, Rob. 
[00:33:30]  The last time that you messed with Iraq and he cursed, it dumped out.  You guys had to do it again so you could get the radio play.  Yeah, you know what?  Oh, man.  It is the rules, Iraq.  You cursed.  So they didn't hear the reaction.  I do think.  And it is the rule that you've got to do it until you don't curse, remember?  He's going back to the bathroom with his underwear.  That's a good point.  He doesn't even question.  You know, we forgot.  Thank God.  Yeah, thank you, Rob.  Rob from Rhode Island reminded us.  Thank you.  I'm glad we have listeners with very good memories. 
[00:34:00]  That's right.  It is the rules.  Iraq dropped the F-bomb.  They had to dump out, so the listeners missed some of the fun and hijinks.  That's right.  Unless you got the satellite, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  The reaction was great.  We want everyone to enjoy.  Of course.  Iraq's reaction to having hot wax dumped down his crack.  All right.  He's got his underwear back on.  Now, Iraq, if you could get us a reaction without cursing, you're good.  No cursing, Iraq.  Why are you limping? 
[00:34:30]  The underwear doesn't want to, like, form to my body anymore.  Nothing does.  It's like wearing it with the cardboard.  Maybe rings.  I don't want it anymore, too.  Now.  All right.  Well.  It's got to be.  And why don't you do the honors with Jimmy?  Oh, no.  I like watching.  All right.  I'll do one.  Is there enough?  Yeah.  Well, I'm pouring wax from this candle into this one.  Ah, there you go.  I just had a half a shot.  There you go.  You want to put it in the microwave?  Nice and hot.  Yeah.  Can I microwave this?  No. 
[00:35:00]  That'll be tragic.  All right.  Oh, that's a funny walk, Jimmy.  Now, Iraq, pause down a little bit.  You were a little shy before.  A little bit.  Pull down.  A little bit.  All right, Jimmy.  Why are they so tight?  How about you?  Because I'm pulling them right now.  How about you open them a little bit?  Oh, hurry up.  My tail went out.  No, no, no, no.  No.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Don't move.  He broke his nose.  He smacked his face into the mic. 
[00:35:30]  He's bleeding.  Jeez.  Okay.  What'd you do, Iraq?  Give him one to the side.  Oh.  Ooh.  One more.  Jimmy.  I got one more, Iraq.  One more, Iraq.  Move the mic out of my face.  What happened?  You hit your nose on the mic?  You're damaging the equipment, Iraq.  What are you doing?  All right, he's trying not to scream.  His face is red. 
[00:36:00]  He's trying not to scream.  He's trying.  Oh.  You know what I'm going to give you on your own, just curiosity?  I only have a couple drops in here.  Can I try one on your chest?  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Lay down on your back.  Oh, is there any left in there?  Here you go.  I'm almost out of wax anyway.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Oh, I feel like a little dominatrix.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's right.  All right, Iraq, lay down there on the floor.  Lay on your back, slut.  Slut. 
[00:36:30]  Iraq's on the floor.  On his back.  All right.  I'm just going to try it.  Yeah.  Not on the face.  What's that?  Not on the face.  Not on the face.  Oh, boy.  I've never said that before.  All right.  There we go.  Pouring it on his nips.  Oh.  Oh, it's in my armpits. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, hot wax rolls.  Oh, was that pleasureful?  Oh, I got a little bit.  I dropped it on each nipple.  How did that feel?  That was the worst one?  It's tingly.  Yeah?  Oh, my God.  That was really good.  How was that good? 
[00:37:30]  Whoa, back, buddy.  Lamb, a lamb.  Whoa, back, buddy.  Lamb, a lamb.  She really hits me high.  Lamb, a lamb.  You know that's no lie.  Lamb, a lamb.  She's so rock, buddy.  Lamb, a lamb.  She's always a day.  Lamb, a lamb.  Whoa, back, buddy.  Lamb, a lamb.

Nice  Oh, but she'd ruin you  She would ruin you  Oh, believe me  It's going to be 70-year-old Anthony again  Because all the big muscle hunks and idiots that know her 
[00:46:30]  I mean, she knows probably like a lot of  And you'll be out with her  And she'll be hugging them  Hi!  And you'll be like  Just laughing  Jimmy instantly turns it into a cuckold situation  I don't mean like that  That's so funny  I'm just sitting there going  Yeah!  I know what I'm feeling  I say within a month  She's living in Anthony's house  And he didn't even ask her  She's just going to completely take over everything  She's driving your sports cars around Long Island  There's bottles all over the place 
[00:47:00]  Guns  That could be a great relationship though  Oh, yeah  I bet you guys would get along well  Oh, you think?  I really do, yeah  Hey, this is Jill Michelini  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments  Hey, it's the worst of Opie and Anthony's 2008 cringiest moments  E-Rock  Prime time Sam Roberts  And Derek's somewhere in the studio  Not participating  But he's just hanging out  Checking out the festivities  Hi, Derek  There we go  Well, if Derek wasn't a silent part of this 
[00:47:30]  It wouldn't be a real Opie and Anthony show  We're looking at the saga that was the Anthony relationship  That went across 2008  We just heard how the relationship started  The couple, Jill Michelini and Anthony  Did end up going on a date  They went out on a work night for whatever reason  And E-Rock, if you recall  Anthony didn't exactly show up for work at all  No, he didn't  The next day  In fact, he barely, if I remember right  Checked in before the show was even over  Right  He wasn't answering the phone  Nobody knew where he was 
[00:48:00]  What he was  Well, we had an idea of what he was doing  Well, he called Steve  At about  Or no, no, no  It was the night before  He called Steve around midnight  Or one o'clock in the morning  Yeah  Obviously having a good time  But saying  Oh, I think I'm sick  I'm not going to make it  With Jill laughing in the background  Now, there's a key moment in this piece here  Where Anthony talks a little bit about the restaurant  That they went to  Mm-hmm  Because it'll come up a little later  As we tell the saga of Anthelini 
[00:48:30]  Well, you know what that is, E-Rock  No  It's foreshadowing  Is it?  Yeah  And so this is Anthony's call into the show  It was 10.30 or so  Before he finally called into the O&A show that day  After or during his first date with Jill Michelini  So let's hear it  On the worst of Opie and Anthony's 2008 craziest moments  Let's take a look back at Opie and Anthony's cringe moments  A selection of segments that'll make you stare at the radio and say  What the F was that? 
[00:49:00]  Holy crap  I'm done  Yes, you just heard what you thought you heard  It's Opie and Anthony's cringe moments  Ladies and gentlemen  He's in the middle of doing the walk of shame  It's Anthony Cumia  Hi  Hey, buddy  What's up, Anthony?  What happened?  You didn't come in today  Yeah, I was feeling a little poorly  Is the date officially over? 
[00:49:30]  Uh, no  Now, is this still a comfortable date or basically you just won't leave?  Yeah  Is the alcohol starting to wear off and you're both looking at each other kind of awkwardly?  You're falling in love and she's getting nauseous?  Right  No  It's amazing how well duct tape holds  So what happened, man?  You texted me last night that you were a little  It was very funny your text about Colin 
[00:50:00]  His scenarios were making you laugh  Yeah, yeah  While I was driving in  And all I could think about was Colin's horrific scenarios  About how we won't have anything to talk about  Except Long Island and traffic  Right  Yeah  And, um  Well, that wasn't the case  What happened?  Yeah  Take us through the date a little bit at least  Where, like, you got your hair did at John's Hog  And then what happened?  Uh, then we, then we, um  Went to, uh, dinner  At some place that, that Keith booked 
[00:50:30]  Ah  That, um  I, I gotta tell Keith  I'm a little disappointed  Why?  I don't know  It wasn't quite the intimate  Nice kind of restaurant I wanted  Uh-huh  Like, there were tables  Pretty close to our table  And a bunch of  Friggin' old ladies  Sitting there  Talking about their  1990 cell phones  And how they don't work  And it just wasn't, you know  The atmosphere 
[00:51:00]  What kind of restaurant?  I, I mean, Matt  I think you went Italian, right?  Of course  Of course we did  Went Italian  But it wasn't the type of place  That you would have booked on your own?  No  Not on my own  No  How, you should have taken it on a Morton's  How, how was the food?  Uh  What food?  Jesus  We don't know  You don't know?  No  Um  Let's see  I think I had two pieces of lettuce  Uh-huh 
[00:51:30]  And  Jill had  Some cherry tomatoes  And cheese  Uh-huh  And then our dinner came  But  The wine was a little more important  So you guys just looked at the dinner?  It sat in front of us for hours  As we just drank  I was hoping  A bottle of wine  Bottles?  How many bottles?  Um  Two at the restaurant  And then  One more  Somewhere else 
[00:52:00]  Holy shit  Where else did you drink the wine?  Uh  Let me see  In the car probably  Driving in the L.A.  At Jill's house  Okay  At Jill's house  Yeah  That's  That's  So you guys got along well  You were just talking about work and stuff  And  Yeah  How was the conversation?  We were talking about work  And um  You know  Cause we're both broadcasters  Yeah  Yeah  And when did you realize  That you might be able to  I mean  I don't even know if you did 
[00:52:30]  But when did you realize  That you might be able to sneak a kiss  Like on the cheek at least  Well  Well we're assuming too much Jimmy  I mean  Was there kissing involved?  I don't know  Anthony Copia  I think we made a disgusting display  At the restaurant  Oh my  Well can I  Why?  I showed a lot of restraint  My uh  My pal  Uh  I  Pictures  What?  And we have pictures  Are we gonna be posting pictures somewhere?  I don't know  You guys  You guys are heading toward a reality show 
[00:53:00]  Maybe we  We should film  A reality show  That we just throw up on our website  Little vignettes  With Anthony and Jill  They already did that  It's called  The Days of Wine and Roses  Wine and more wine  I  Oh my god  I just erased your text messages  By accident  Cause my phone filled up  Oh my god  I just lost the evidence  And I was  I was reading your text messages  This morning  And I was putting blanks  In uh  Very important places  Well 
[00:53:30]  I was just talking about  How we were making a  A disgusting display of  Um  You know  Public display of affection  Yeah they were  Uh  You were  It's safe  We were horrifying people  We  We didn't even notice  Like  I wasn't looking around or anything  Right  But I'm sure the old people were horrified  Right  That was going on at our table  So you guys were like  Uh  Just having a make out session  Right at the table  Yeah  Who kissed who Anthony  Yeah how did that go down 
[00:54:00]  I don't know  It was one of those  Like movie moments  Where you just kind of  Look into each other's eyes  And you know  Oh my god  A movie moment  I don't think it was a movie moment  Try the wine  Yeah it was the wine  So did she only want to have  A couple of drinks  And then you just kept saying  I'm pleased you appreciate good wine  Actually  She took the wine  Right  Yeah she picked the wine  And um 
[00:54:30]  Wait wait  It could say a lot about her  What kind of wine  Oh yeah  What was it  I would imagine like  It was  Some nice  She probably picked  Like a California  Merlot  2004  2005  It was some Italian wine  Wasn't it  Oh really  Yeah  Very nice  So did you say anything  While she was eating  Her cherry tomatoes  Yeah we were talking  The whole time  Okay  Yeah it wasn't anything 
[00:55:00]  Like Colin's  Stupid fantasy  Of a disaster date  Were you concerned  That she wasn't eating more  No I wasn't concerned  With anything  Food  All right  Someone doing my job  Very well over there  So did you  Did you guys have a lot  In common  Yeah  Yeah  We're from Long Island  Uh huh  Both Italian  Uh huh  We have similar interests

[01:53:00]  I  Must  Admit  I  Really  Did  Fall  In  Love  With  Him  And  Was  Devastated  When  I  Caught  Him  Cheating  It  Was  Bad  Let's  See  It  Happened  The  Night  Of  Our  Lu  So  That  Was  August  16th  And  For  Two  Weeks  I  Cried  And  Was  Devastated  But  Now  Almost  Six  Weeks  Later  I  Am  So  Much  Better  And  Have  Moved  On  Completely  Not  Really  If  You're  Writing  Emails  Yeah  Moved  On  Completely 
[01:53:30]  Until  Yesterday  You  Hadn't  Moved  On  Completely  You  Still  Had  My  Crap  And  Was  Holding  It  Until  I  Gave  You  A  Thousand  Dollars  Keep  That  In  Mind  Still  In  Disbelief  That  He's  Bragging  About  How  Cool  It  Was  To  Have  This  Twenty  Year  Old  In  His  Bedroom  While  I  Left  Only  To  Come  Back  I  Mean  I  Was  Practically  Living  There  Yeah  That  Was  Partly  The  Problem  I  Was  Falling  Right  Back  Into 
[01:54:00]  It  But  It  Taught  Me  A  Lesson  And  I  Sure  Know  I  Deserve  So  Much  Better  And  Karma  Will  Come  Around  Please  Don't  Believe  All  The  Things  He  Says  On  The  Air  Like  This  Morning  I  Was  So  Disgusted  Yes  Keith  Came  Over  To  Give  Me  One  Dollar  But  For  What  For  The  $429  Camera  That  He  Was  Replacing  That  Got  Stolen  From  His  House 
[01:54:30]  And  $600  Worth  Of  Dry  Cleaning  From  This  Place  In  New  York  City  Which  He  Made  Me  Bring  My  Clothes  To  Three  Months  Ago  All  Right  Here's  Here's  The  First  Blatant  Lie  I  Don't  Know  Crap  About  Dry  Cleaning  I  What  Do  I  Know  About  Dry  Cleaning  And  I'm  Gonna  Sit  There  And  Go  Hey  You  Take  Your  Clothes  Here  You  Take 
[01:55:00]  It  To  This  Dry  Cleaner  Why  Cause  It  Cost  $600  Why  She  Has  Her  Stuff  Dry  Cleaned  Like  Every  Day  There's  Dry  Cleaning  Crap  Going  In  And  Out  Of  Her  Apartment  Everything  Is  Wrapped  In  That  Dry  Cleaners  Plastic  Stuff  Clothes  Everything  She  Knows  A  Lot  About  Dry  Cleaning  And  She  Knew  This  Place  And  She  Dropped  It  Off  There  And 
[01:55:30]  For  Some  Reason  They  Charged  $600  And  Then  She  Assumed  It  Was  My  Responsibility  To  Pay  It  Which  To  Me  Was  Complete  Blackmail  To  Get  My  Stuff  Back  Of  Which  Was  Not  Even  My  Laptop  And  An  Easy  Pass  I  Could  Have  Canceled  The  Easy  Pass  And  Got  A  New  One  But  It  Was  The  Principle  Of  The  Thing  She  Owed  Me  My  Laptop  My  Easy  Pass  And  She  Held  It  For  $1,000 
[01:56:00]  I  Don't  Know  What  This  Says  Keith  Came  Over  To  Give  Me  $1  Maybe  It's  A  Typo  1K  Maybe  Maybe  It was  1K  Well  That  Sounds  Normal  Then  But  For  What  For  The  Camera  And  The  That  Comes  Out  To  $1,000  Right  Or  $1,029  Right  But  I  Mean  The  29  Is  In  Consequential  So  It  Seems  Funny  For  Her  To  Say  $1  And  If  It  Was  A  Typo  You  Know  It  Comes  Out  To  The  Right  Amount  Possibly  Just  A  Rebuttal  For 
[01:56:30]  You  Saying  It  Was  A  $1,000  Blackmail  Probably  Saying  Yeah  It  Was  $1,000  But  For  What  This  Is  What  It  Was  For  Right  Oh  Okay  Well  You  Know  Why  Did  I  Pay  For  Her  Dry  Cleaning  Why  Did  I  Pay  For  The  Camera  She  Lost  The  God  Damn  Thing  It  Was  My  House  At  My  Party  But  You  Know  She  Lost  The  The  Camera  But  I  Said  You  Know  Something  I'm  Just  Going  To  Pay  For  It  And  End  This  Whole  Thing  So 
[01:57:00]  Keith  Goes  To  Go  Over  And  Give  Her  The  $1,000  For  My  Stuff  And  She  Texts  Keith  Or  Calls  Him  Or  Whatever  And  Says  She  Also  Wants  The  Big  Ceramic  Boot  The  Giant  Ceramic  Cowboy  Boot  Out  By  My  Side  Door  Take  It  Good  Don't  Let  It  Kick  You  In  The  Ass  On  The  Way  Out  It's  Just  Oh  So  It  Has  Nothing  To  Do  With  Me  Trying  To  Get  Money  From  Him  There

[02:15:00]  you pull  that one  off  after the  virus show  you got  your  quote  girlfriend  and the  girl you're  banging  in the  same car  and  and Jill  has no  no clue  at that  point  I  always  always  show  my  ex  girlfriend  my  you know  either  new  girlfriend  or who  I'm  having  sex  with  or  very  close  friend  you know  I'll always  give him  a little  show  of who  that is  yeah  oh so 
[02:15:30]  you had  something  for the  hedge fund  guy  yes  the  hedge fund  manager  Joseph  D.  Virgilio  oh boy  well  where do  I start  first  I hope  get one  of those  get one  of those  things that  go under  your sheets  to cover  up your  mattress  what do  you mean  like  well 
[02:16:00]  you know  if you  ever have  a child  and they  go from  the crib  to the  bed  you might  want to  put something  under there  you know  to protect  the mattress  from any  staining  she takes  she takes  these goddamn  pills  that keep  the fat  from  digesting  like you  know  because she  doesn't want  to gain  weight  so there's  like these  pills 
[02:16:30]  that keep  fat from  digesting  so it goes  right through  you  it's not  absorbed in  your body  it goes  right through  you  so if  she eats  a lot  of stuff  with a lot  of fat  in it  she takes  a lot  more  of these  fat go  through  your pills  and then  she goes  to bed  and a  certain  part  of her  body  will leak  because 
[02:17:00]  that fat  that isn't  absorbed in  the body  has to  come out  somewhere  and it  comes out  the normal  place  but  it is  like  I guess  I guess  that isn't  a water  real good  water tight  seal  so  I woke  up one  morning  and I  swear  it looked  like someone  overturned  a pizza  on my  sheets  it was  nothing  but  this  yellowish  grease 
[02:17:30]  a grease  stain  all  over  my  sheets  grease  stain  came  out  of  there  and  soaked  into  my  bed  sheets  and it  did  it  looked  like  you ever  take  a  napkin  and  blot  the  grease  from  pizza  dude  it was  exactly  like  that  only  spread  out  the  size 
[02:18:00]  of  it  was  probably  about  two  feet  wide  yeah  yeah  and about  two feet  long  like a  roundish  thing  of two  feet  diameter  all over  her side  of the bed  on the  sheets  and this  happens  more than  once  believe me  so  dude  you know  you might  want  you might  want  to  get  some  cheap  sheets  what's  the  product  called  ally  or  something  like that  is it  ally  and there's 
[02:18:30]  a warning  that says  on the  warning  on the  package  that says  bring  extra  clothes  to work  yeah  it's  that  new  drug  they  approved  over  the  counter  the  over  the  counter  version  and  right  there  on  the  package  you  can  buy  it  in  all  the  drug  stores  yeah  does  work  but  it  does  warn  you  when  you  start  using  it  you  have  to  bring  extra  clothes  because  you'll  leak  into  your  clothes  yeah  yeah  so that  was  wow  all over  my  sheets  I woke  up  and I  was  like  whoa  whoa  and  believe  me  that  took  one  activity 
[02:19:00]  that  I  really  like  doing  right  out  of  the  picture  making  clan  hoods  I  guess  that's  all  right  oh  they're  calling her  Jill  Nicolicki  oh  boy  there  it  is  oh  there  it  is  Jim's  head  is  now  in  the  crook  of  his  arm  he's  leaned  over  the  back  of  his  chair  he  can't  even

[02:33:30]  Opie and Anthony, 2008, cringiest  moments, Iraq, primetime  Sam Roberts. Yep. And Derek's  still with us. Well, Derek doesn't  leave the studio. Oh. He just sits here.  But we've been talking about some of the cringiest  moments in 2008, and we did the  whole Anthelini saga, but 
[02:34:00]  what the Anthelini saga led to  was more Anthelini saga. No, no,  no, it's done. Oh, okay. But it  was Ant's new beef, and it's still going  on. End of 2009, this beef is  carrying over. What a grudge. The  Aunt Gene Simmons beef. Oh, yes.  Because basically, we had Gene Simmons  in studio, and he made a remark  about Anthony's  girlfriend at the time,  Joe Nicolini, which I think we have the  clip. Yes, we do. Alright, so this is the  clip. What do you do for  pleasure? What this? 
[02:34:30]  I intend on fucking your girlfriend  tonight. I don't know. Hey.  Whoa. Wait a minute now. Well, I mean that  as a term of endearment. You actually  probably just met her over at Channel  11. Who? Oh, Jill.  Yes. Yes. No, I'm  fucking with you. But the point  I'm making...  The point I'm making... All of a sudden he looked at me with a little  more respect. I liked that.  I'm not at all  concerned with respect. I really am not.  So he makes this comment. It pisses  Ant off, but he forgot all about it. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah. Because he didn't care that much. But  then he remembers one day he's looking at the TV,  he sees Gene Simmons, and  everything comes flooding back to him. And  he shared with all of us exactly how he felt  about Gene Simmons. I don't think he was happy, Sam.  He... Well, let's let the listeners be  the judge. Alright, it's the 2008  Worst of Opie and Anthony Cringiest Moments.  Something in that order. Let's play it.  It's Opie and Anthony's Worst of  2008 Cringe Moments.  A look back at some of the most uncomfortable  yet hilarious portions of the show.  From the bottom of my heart, 
[02:35:30]  I hope you have a healthy  and a happy new year.  Oh.  It's Opie and Anthony's Worst of  2008 Cringe Moments.  That's right, we're laughing at you, stupid.  Remember when that  fucking douchebag, Gene Simmons,  was here that day?  And he was over at Channel 11  before?  He was giving Jill  all kinds of fucking shit. 
[02:36:00]  Like, trying to pick up on her  and everything.  And then he made like, he didn't really know  anything that was going on.  And then he goes, oh, maybe I'll just go  and fuck your girlfriend.  He went over there and  actually made a harassing  problem over there  where her boss  had to come up to Jill  and ask if there was a problem.  Because  Gene like pinned her against  a wall.  Wow.  And was being really like  physical  and very,  very nasty.  Really? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was like, you know,  what the fuck?  Gene, sit that fucking cocksucker.  And then it's like, yeah, well,  you know what I'll be doing tonight.  And he goes, yeah, well,  I'll be fucking your girlfriend.  And it's like, no, Gene,  first of all, I'll be.  And secondly, you know,  she thinks, you know,  you're a fucking old  hack douche.  Wait, Anthony, was it before  or after he was here?  It was minutes  before he was sitting there. 
[02:37:00]  Did he know it was your chick  when he was pinning her?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Of course he did.  How do you know?  He knew.  Because he had fucking,  or there was a discussion  about that beforehand.  Oh, wow.  And she had said, you know,  knock it off.  I have a boyfriend,  shit like that.  And he wouldn't fucking stop.  He wouldn't stop being  the fucking egotistical prick  that he thinks everybody  thinks he deserves.  It must be hard for him,  though, now that he's old  and ugly with bad hair, 
[02:37:30]  that he still thinks  he could be Jim Simmons  from 1982.  That he's getting  every fucking chick.  Yes, Danny?  Do you remember when he was in  and he was sitting to my left  and I have these big  computer screens in front of me  and, you know,  during interviews or whatever,  like, I'll try and research  stuff and everything.  Yeah.  So I guess I was trying  to type quietly.  Right.  But he still kind of  heard a little bit of the,  you know.  Yeah, the keyboard.  And it annoyed him so much  that he actually put his hand,  like, under the monitor  and put his hand on my hand,  like, stop doing that  while I'm talking.  But the thing is,  he didn't even skip a beat 
[02:38:00]  as he was talking.  He's like,  and the latest thing  I'm hawking and trying to sell.  And as he's talking,  he just didn't look.  He just put his hand  over on Danny's hand.  His hand said,  knock that the fuck off.  But his mouth was still  selling his fucking wares.  Didn't even look  in my direction.  Just took his hand,  just went under the monitor  and grabbed my hand,  like, stop doing that.  Don't get me wrong.  I don't care if all  of Kiss fucked are right now.  I'm just saying,  at the time,  don't fuck with,  you know,  the girl that I'm going with  at the time.  I'm confused, though. 
[02:38:30]  It disrespected me  and he was being  a fucking cocksucker.  I'm confused, though.  Do you like Gene Simmons?  No, Gene Simmons  is a fucking cunt.  Wow.  That's what my official stance  on Gene Simmons is now.  Gene Simmons is a cunt.  No, the guy fucking knew  and he was bullshitting  and trying to play me  like a fucking sap  as I sat here  not knowing what happened yet.  I knew right afterwards  what happened,  but I had no idea  what happened.  He knew,  and he's fucking,  like, trying to play me off 
[02:39:00]  as the dim-witted  fucking ignorant asshole  that doesn't know  what's going on.  Fuck you,  you old cocksucker.  Fuck you.  Your porno looked like shit, too.  You don't know how to fuck  if you ever did.  If you ever did,  you don't know how to fuck.  Fuck anymore.  Get any girl that you fucked,  I'll fuck her,  and they'll go,  that's a fucking.  The thing I got from Gene Simmons  wasn't a fucking.  What was wrong  with his technique?  What?  What was wrong  with his technique?  He's got no stamina.  He's got nothing. 
[02:39:30]  He's fucking just a load  fucking blobbing  back and forth.  Make some moves.  Twist some shit around.  Make the girl happy,  you dumb fuck.  Put your face down there.  First of all,  he put a condom on, Fad.  Oh, put a condom on.  It was a kiss condom.  A what?  Yeah, he put a kiss condom on.  He probably fucks  like the teacher  from Forrest Gump.  Yeah.  I got to move Danny  up the list.  That's good.  Danny, I'm moving you  up the list today.  That's good.  You're up David's list.  That's good.  All right.  Maybe I could be funnier  than Gene Simmons.  Gene's Eve. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  That'd be nice.  You already are.  You said something.  Gene Simmons.  Fuck him.  My loyalty is with Anthony.  I love Gene,  but my loyalty will always be with Anthony.  How loyal, though?  Go home.  You got some memorabilia from Kiss.  Are you willing to throw it in?  Wow.  Wow.  Are you willing to throw it in the dumpster?  Hold on.  He should bring it in tomorrow  and throw it away.  Yes, bring in your Kiss memorabilia tomorrow, Jimmy.  I wouldn't bring that in  if he had harassed Anthony's mother  and my mother.  I'm not getting rid of my Kiss shit.  But there is loyalty there, right? 
[02:40:30]  There is loyalty.  There is loyalty.  There is loyalty in here.  But you're not bringing the memorabilia.  No!  Gene signed that stuff for me.  We need a Gene memorabilia burning tomorrow.  That's it.  No, I can agree with my friend Anthony  on one hand by a very loyalist.  Gene, it's signed.  Wherever Anthony stands on it,  I'm with him.  That's it.  I understand your point with saying  did he know beforehand and stuff,  which would be like...  Did he find out when...  This is the only reason I'm asking is  because was he hassling her?  I have a boyfriend. 
[02:41:00]  He doesn't give a fuck.  And then finally at the end,  she finally said,  my boyfriend is Anthony  from the opening Anthony show.  Maybe that's what stopped him.  That's why I was asking.  He knew right away.  He kept...  He was persistent on it.  And he kept...  And it was harassment on his part  to where her boss had to come over to her  and ask her what happened.  Like, people were saying  that Gene was harassing you and stuff.  And, yeah.  And then he comes in here  and fucking looking me right in the eyes 
[02:41:30]  and playing me like that.  Well, maybe I'll just fuck your girlfriend.  Like, and I laughed  because it's like,  oh, I'm thinking he doesn't even know  who the fuck she is or anything.  But he knew exactly everything  and he's fucking playing me off like that.  Go fuck yourself,  you fucking old man.  Cocksucker.  Go franchise your shit little makeup band out  and make a few more bucks.  Wow.  Drop dead rich.  Good.  Good for you.  Look at Gene fucking in his porno.  Good job.  He's wearing a t-shirt. 
[02:42:00]  That's good.  Yeah, lift the gut up.  There you go.  Now your dick can fit in.  Who's the girl?  She's fantastic.  She's got big boobies.  I don't know.  Look, look at his slow motion fucking.  I love the fact he's wearing a t-shirt and socks  and his pants are down still.  Oh, God.  It's like the old mangy lion  plowing the fucking lioness  on the Serengeti.  You know that old mangy lion?  It's his last year as Top of the Pride.  Wow, you've been holding this in for a while. 
[02:42:30]  Fuck Gene Simmons.  We have a touch of raw nerve here.  Wow.  Can we have a kiss song, please?  Which one do you like?  Lick it up.  Which one do you want today?  Oh, give me one with Gene singing.  Yeah.  Great expectations.  We're Dr. Love.  Yeah.  Here you go.  Dr. Love, man.  Dr. Love.  Go ahead.  Climb aboard that fucking broad in your porno.  Go ahead.  Boy, you must be proud of that one. 
[02:43:00]  His flat fucking saggy ass is moving like,  like, it looks like two old droopy doilies  swinging in the breeze on a clothesline.  That's what his ass looks like  as he's fucking this hot chick.  Droopy doilies.  Oh, you know he'd be getting her  if he wasn't Gene Simmons from Kiss.  You know that.  Absolutely.  There.  There's Gene.  That's it.  The old lion.  Punch up an old lion fucking a lioness.  And that's what Gene looks like. 
[02:43:30]  You nailed that bitch.  Bro, he's got the money over there, man.  He pulled that up instantly.  That's it, Gene.  Goddamn.  As long as you can get through one fucking  without your hair falling off,  I guess it's okay.  I guess it's a victory.  Droopy doilies.  There you go.  That's the line of the day.  Oh, after he ate the girl's pussy,  she thought she forgot to shave,  but it was just Gene's wig fell in her lap.  He didn't realize.  Do you guys still do the line of the day?  Oh, yeah.  Because you just heard it right there. 
[02:44:00]  Wow.  Nice.  Fuck you, Gene Simmons.  Pinned her up against the wall, huh?  Yeah.  Like pinned her against the fucking wall.  Was there any booby touching going on?  I think he was like trying.  She was pushing his hands down  because he was trying to put his hands around her waist.  And it was like in the main office part  where everyone could see everything.  And people were looking,  and it was like,  oh, this is weird.  Like, this is weird.  What the fuck is Gene doing?  Are you mad that you didn't know 
[02:44:30]  when he came in here?  That's what pissed me off the most  is that he fucking looked at me  and he knew,  and he's fucking straight-faced  pitching all of his wares.  I'm sitting there giving him the time of day  and a forum to pitch his fucking bullshit on,  and he's playing me like a sap,  like a sucker.  Fuck him.  Fuck you, Gene.  I think you should get Gene in the studio.  Oh, if Gene came in here,  I wouldn't fucking hold back.  I'd say the same fucking thing.  Whether he was on the phone  or fucking in the studio, 
[02:45:00]  I would say the same fucking thing to him  because that pissed me off.  He tried to play me,  and he'd be all,  well, listen,  and I wouldn't let him fucking sit there  and do that.  No way.  No fucking way.  Gene Simmons on the show  when Jimmy's out of town.  Go ahead.  As soon as possible,  fuck him.  Oh, I've got it already.  I would be right here with Anthony.  I would not as much as Gene was here,  but I would be completely with you.  And spirit,  you wouldn't actually say that.  And all that memorabilia,  you're going to bring that in tomorrow, Jimmy?  Gene Simmons memorabilia.  That's good.  Would you break something else 
[02:45:30]  from your collection  in honor of the fact that  and H.G. Simmons?  Pull that fucking,  pull that wig off,  add two guys,  and you have a lemon party.  No shit.  Fuck you.  Don't mess with Ed.  Oh, there he is, right?  Is that really him without his hair?  That's good.  That's for a shot.  Yeah, no,  some say it is  and others say that it was a stunt.  Right.  Like he put a bald cap on.  Oh, did he?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Go play keyboards for Letterman.  Well.  Fuck yourself. 
[02:46:00]  Why don't we, uh...  Fuck your mother.  Let's give an open invite  to Gene Simmons  to come back on our show  to comment on what Ann is saying today.  No problem.  And in between commenting,  we'll let you plug  a few of your shitty products.  and, uh...  Oh, products.  What would he be fucking plugging now?  Besides other people's friends.  Besides trying to plug, yeah.  Trying to plug my ex-girlfriend.  Can we get Gene Simmons  on the phone at least?  For when?  Like now.  Would be good.  Yeah, he's waiting.  I can see if he's up.  Huh?  I can see if they're up. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  He needs his Betty Bye.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Tell him to do a shot of Geritol  and get his ass on the phone.  Fuck him.  I'll say,  Anthony, I'm upset with you,  but buy my new DVD until now.  What I was doing...  No, you don't understand.  That's just what I do.  See, this is what I do.  I know these guys.  He would say something like that.  You're absolutely right.  It's just what I do.  I don't know.  Why are you getting so upset?  Why are you so...  I didn't actually fuck her.  Yeah, he'd do that  passive-aggressive bullshit  that he does.  Why get upset, Anthony?  Why do...  I don't understand. 
[02:47:00]  She's a big girl.  Where's this hostility coming from?  If she wanted to fuck me,  she would have fucked me.  But since she didn't,  where's the problem?  He's got his fucking voice.  And it would be like,  well, Gene,  you came over here  and started fucking with me.  You didn't tell me shit about that.  And then playing me off  like I'm a fucking sap  by telling me  you're going to go  and fuck my girlfriend that night  where no one was in on the joke  except you and your ego?  Go fuck yourself.  You know what he would say.  What?  How do you know she didn't want it?  How do you know?  They all want it from Gene. 
[02:47:30]  Just watch my video.  They're all dogs.  Look at my video.  It looks fantastic.  As I lay there,  ugh.  Just fucking,  oh my God,  being ravaged by that.  That fucking ball sack  must scrape on the rug  like melted Turkish taffy.  We're supposed to be interviewing  Chris Jericho.  Oh, I'm sorry, Chris.  And that TV show,  when is that?  I don't know if we compete  with droopy doilies.  He's got doily ass 
[02:48:00]  and Turkish taffy balls.  All I have to say is  thank God it wasn't Ozzy  because then it would be  really confusing in here.  No, no.  Thank God it's, uh...  Ozzy.  Ozzy wouldn't do that.  Ozzy was a respectful man.  Ozzy is respectful.  You know what it was?  It was the lack of respect  for me.  He disrespected me.  Especially as a guest  on your show.  Yes, as a guest on my show.  Thank you, Chris.  Absolutely.  As a guest on the show.  And he disrespected me.  Knew he was disrespecting me.  And did it in a way 
[02:48:30]  where he knew  I didn't know the situation  so I couldn't even fight back.  Which is a pussy-ass  fucking punk move.  Nice.  Let's go to the phones.  Yes.  I also want to defend  Gene Simmons here.  Greg in New Hampshire.  Oh, hey.  The day of that  original interview,  I was getting  douche chills.  Like, you can't even believe.  I called a few times  so you guys would trash him.  And I'm so glad  I'm still listening  to here and now  because he is  such a douchebag.  Thank you.  Good.  When does the  fucking Gene Simmons 
[02:49:00]  kiss penis implant  come out?  Maybe he could  fuck a little better.  You are one lousy fuck  from the look of it.  Oh, God.  That's his sex music.  That's what girls like.  A nice fucking  a nice fucking fuck  that they could  use a grandfather  clock pendulum  to fuck by.  A metronome  with the fucking  weight way up top.  That's what they  want to see. 
[02:49:30]  Tick tock.  Tick tock.  Change it up  a little, Gene.  Do you fuck  faster or harder?  I do it all.  Do you?  Slow, fast.  I like poking a little.  Eh, eh, eh.  And then  wham!  The slow drive.  The slow drive.  And then fast.  And then one leg's up.  The other leg's up.  They're both down.  Flip over.  We'll do it this way.  I'm on my back.  She's on her back.  We're both on our  fucking head  against the headboard, 
[02:50:00]  against the bed.  I don't give a shit.  I'm fucking.  And in comparison,  Gene Simmons?  That's how we fuck.  Slow and steady  wins the race.  Okay.  How about I go  and fuck your girlfriend?  No, no, no, no, no.  He's turning dopey.  Oh, fuck me harder.  Fuck me harder, Gene.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:50:30]  I think the three of us  could just leave  and then actually  talk to us for another hour.  We had it.  And Gene Simmons,  enough of him already.  He's getting a lot of publicity.  He would love this.  Oh, yeah, he would.  There's no such thing  as bad publicity, Anthony.  Oh, no.  All publicity is good publicity.  This is bringing everybody  back to Kiss.  That's what it is.  The greatest rock and roll  I've ever.  It all comes back to Kiss.  Shut it.  That's really...  Fucking Gene.  Glad we got that out there.  Man, that was purged.  I'm surprised I forgot about that.  Yeah, well,  you're never going to forget it now.  How did I forget that? 
[02:51:00]  Do you want the audience  to Google bomb something?  Gene Simmons...  Gene Simmons,  lousy lay.  Nah, we could do better than that.  Really?  Yeah, that is pretty bad.  Gene Simmons wig.  Our problem is  most of our listeners  don't know how to spell lousy.  Yeah, that's true.  They'll mess it all up.  Or Gene...  Or Gene Simmons living in Laos.  Right.  J-A-N-S.  I don't know what happened.  Gene Simmons went to Laos?  What?  He's got life.  How about it?  No.  You could just throw it 
[02:51:30]  in the washing machine.  How about a simple  F. Gene Simmons?  That's good.  Yeah.  I don't care.  What do you got there?  I just...  I'd had it with him  by that point.  And then...  And I'd had it with him  when he was sitting there.  I was just being gracious  because, again,  as Chris had pointed out,  he's a guest on the show.  But, you know,  after I found out,  I was, like,  so pissed  that I didn't get a chance  to, like,  jump on him  for that  for that whole 
[02:52:00]  fucking episode.  Because you had no idea.  No!  And that's the point.  I didn't know.  And would have unloaded  in front of him.  Guaranteed.  Fuck yeah.  I didn't know.  Oh, that's got to be  a treat into the girl's ear.  That's got to be a treat.  Oh!  Sorry, Jim.  I'm kind of using your bit,  but...  That's all right.  Oh, the Gene Simmons.  Oh!  After that fucking  lousy fuck.  Does it end with a  blurk-a-blurk-a-blurk-a?  Blurk-a-blurk.  Oh, just no muscles  left to launch any jizz.  It just must dribble out. 
[02:52:30]  Oh!  Like lava.  Oh, it's just got to be horrible.  You know when you turn  the hose off first  and then take the nozzle  and it just goes  blurk-glurk  over the top of your hand.  Lava after the eruption.  Oh, yeah.  The volcano's long been dormant.  It's very bubbly.  Just pours over the edge  every so often.  A glurk-glurk-glurk.  Misfire.  Fuck.  Can I just say  out of all the radio interviews  I've done 
[02:53:00]  that your microphones  smell the nicest?  Do you guys spray some?  Oh, people have to do that  beforehand.  Man, that's a really nice smell.  It's like you've  washed these overnight.  A little lava  coming down the mountain.  A glurk-glurk-glurk.  It's lava moving so slowly  people can just walk by it.  That's Gene.  Man, you're on the case, man.  He's pulling up  all this great stuff.  I'm feeling  I'm going to come.  Give me another  ten minutes.  Glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-glurk-gl 
[02:53:30]  scrubbing.  She's sitting in a cold tub, just quietly  weeping. 
[02:54:00]  I don't want to use the word, but you know,  the type of shower. Gotta get the filth off me.  I can't get over what a good fuck Anthony probably is.  Honest to God,  fuck much more like Gene does.  I'm a little worse lay. I'm mediocre  because I'm so high maintenance. I have to just go  slow and you have to play with my nipples because I've desensitized  myself. I'm going to go back  to Jimmy now. I enjoy him.  Jimmy, Ant's got a problem with Gene  Simmons. Coincidentally, you got a book  called I Hate Your Guts. Yes.  There will be a paperback, and you know how you 
[02:54:30]  got to add some new material  in the paperback. Will there be an appendix?  A Gene Simmons chapter  in honor of Anthony.  I would happily  I actually put a Gene amendment in the  old book in Happy Endings because it was  whatever, but I would happily, if Anthony  wrote something and wanted to put it in,  Oh, you won't write it.  It wouldn't be as funny if I wrote it because Anthony's  Oh, I would love to.  I would happily put it under my name.  Yeah, but you're the author. I think, you know,  you should write it in honor of  Oh, and I'd love to write that. 
[02:55:00]  No, but would you have to just transcribe  what he said today?  Yeah, just take the tapes of the show.  I mean, I don't think you have to, you couldn't do  any better than that.  I would happily, for Anthony, put any type of  in the paperback.  Thank you, Jim.  That's not a bad angle.  Hi, this is Gene Simmons. You're listening to the  worst, the absolute worst of  Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments.  Where would you like to take me to dinner?  Let's see.  I actually know a very nice place, 
[02:55:30]  kind of close to where I am.  Smart.  Kind of close to my house.  There's a place in a lot of you.  Shut up, Opie.  And we're back.  It's E-Rock in prime time.  Sam Roberts.  The tandem you thought you'd never see.  Yes, and you thought we had  wrapped up the Anthony saga  by giving you the Gene...  That thought.  Prayed?  Yeah.  That the Gene Simmons was the last  faction of this whole ordeal.  But there's one more little piece  that we need to get to  that'll catch you up  and then you'll know the complete story 
[02:56:00]  of Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony 2008's  cringiest moments right now.  Let's take a look back at Opie and Anthony's  cringe moments.  A selection of segments that'll make you  stare at the radio and say...  What the F was that?  Holy crap!  I'm done!  Yes, you just heard what you thought you heard.  It's Opie and Anthony's cringe moments.  You want to do the Mio's thing, eh?  Uh, yes, yes.  I got such bad news yesterday. 
[02:56:30]  Um, via text.  Yeah?  Yes, it was hot off the presses.  Like, before it even hit Google.  What?  I'm not kidding.  Is that about...  See, I thought you learned about this  from the paper.  It's in the paper today,  but you learned about the fire at Mio's  before it hit the papers.  Yes, yes.  I was texted.  Uh, as you, as you know,  um, I've been raving about a restaurant  in Roslyn called Mio. 
[02:57:00]  Fine Italian restaurant.  It was one of those places I would go into  and, uh, all the staff knew me  and, um, you know,  all for me.  They knew exactly what wine I liked.  Nice.  The, uh, the food.  Fantastic.  And, uh, it was right there in Roslyn.  And, um, I used to go there.  Well, I, I found out through a text  that, uh, Mio's, uh, burnt down. 
[02:57:30]  20-foot flames I'm reading in the paper.  Total loss.  Completely devastated.  You won't be going back there no more.  No.  And, uh, like I said,  it was before I, I, it wasn't on Google.  It wasn't anywhere.  I got the news via text.  And, uh, this person,  it was the first text I had gotten  since probably, um, the end of the summer.  Ah.  Yeah.  Really?  Yes.  Yes.  It was, it was text from Jill.  Jill texted you to tell you that Mio, 
[02:58:00]  Mio burnt to the ground.  20-foot flames, like I said.  What else did she write in the text?  She just said,  hey, I hear your favorite restaurant burnt down.  Well, I hope you're eating there.  I hope you and your whores.  She was just, uh,  hoping you weren't going to respond,  meaning that there was a possibility  you were in the restaurant.  Well, that was one of the places, 
[02:58:30]  if you recall,  during the, um,  very publicized breakup.  Yeah.  Of, uh,  what was called Anthelini at the time.  And the breakup did involve a fire.  I just, you know.  Exactly.  Well, if you,  I'm not saying anything.  I'm just saying,  I'm just throwing facts out.  If you recall,  the, um,  the, uh,  well,  what the hell was I going to say now?  Uh,  the,  the American Express bills  that I would get  would say,  um,  uh,  is this when you took your whore there? 
[02:59:00]  Or is this where you take your whores?  Because like Mio would show up a lot.  She would circle that on the bill.  On there.  Yes.  With a little note.  Sure.  With a little note.  This where you take your whores.  And of course,  um,  there was an episode where  a girl that was at my house,  uh,  lost her clothing  to a fire  that was lit  by Ms.  Nicolini  in the backyard of my house.  In the fire pit.  So when I heard,  uh,  on the news  that Mio had burnt down 
[02:59:30]  what they're calling  a complete loss,  by the way,  a complete loss,  uh,  and getting the news  from a text from her,  it,  uh,  certainly was like,  wow,  that's ironic.  Don't you think?  You actually got the text  the day before it burnt down?  I hear your favorite restaurant  burned down in a few days.  She's sitting out  in front of the place 
[03:00:00]  with Pesci  discussing a date.  I'm trying to bang  this radio guy,  Hendry.  Hey,  Hendry.  Yeah,  help me out here  to smoke  pouring out of the joint.  She's trying to get  one of her girlfriends  to go out with me,  but her girlfriend won't.  Just go out with this guy.  Help me out here.  Yeah.  Heat,  heat from the fire  cracked plate glass windows  and deflated globe lamps  at a restaurant  across the street.  Across the street.  And it should be noted, 
[03:00:30]  Newsday's saying today  that the fire  is not considered  suspicious.  Well,  very,  uh,  very tragic,  I would say.  How does a fire  like that  get so big,  hot,  and,  uh,  just involved  so quickly?  I guess there's a lot of,  uh,  I'll tell you,  a bad economy.  Cooking oil.  You think?  That's how.  Some people do tend  to do that  in a bad economy.  You see a lot of restaurants  kind of go up in smoke.  Oh,  there's a picture  of the fireman, 
[03:01:00]  uh,  taking care of,  uh,  me.  Oh,  it's on the Channel 11 site.  Yeah,  well.  Prominently displayed.  Yeah,  it sure is.  Mio,  home of Anthony  and his whores.  With a little bias.  Popular eatery  and brothel.  But she,  frequented by such scumbags  as Anthony Cumia.  But she had to text you.  Yes.  A little tidbit.  Yes,  it was one of those  little things.  And then she wrote  nothing else?  Did you write her back? 
[03:01:30]  No,  no.  I,  I wasn't sure  if it was,  you know,  one of those things like,  hey,  by the way,  one of your restaurants,  you know,  hey,  burnt down.  And I was supposed  to answer back like,  oh,  wow,  that's a shame.  Or,  if it was one of those  where it's like,  yeah,  I just better delete this.  Because,  you know,  I don't know  if it's meant as a  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  or,  you know,  some conversation.  Of course it's a ha,  ha,  ha,  I figured it was a ha,  ha,  ha,  ha.  She's been waiting 
[03:02:00]  for her shot for a while.  Yeah,  that was a good one.  She got her shot in.  That is,  like,  if I ever went out to eat,  because I usually have,  you know,  my chef make my food.  You know,  it's good,  it's healthy.  But if I did go out,  that was the joint,  you know,  that was the place.  Now,  gone.  Where the hell  am I supposed to go?  FH Riley's.  It's too far.  FH Riley's.  For me,  I mean.  All right,  we'll open up,  like,  get another branch there, 
[03:02:30]  you know,  around Nassau County,  northern Nassau.  We're going to do another branch.  We'll go,  like,  to Jersey or something.  Jersey?  Jersey.  We're going to Jersey?  It's called franchising it,  by the way,  you two.  It's not called opening another branch.  Oh, yeah.  Get a franchise.  Franchise.  They open up a...  The Jern tanks do that.  They open branches.  You're right.  Cody in Indiana,  what's going on?  Yeah,  even though I live in Indiana,  I think I have a little insight  on the incident.  Yeah?  I think it was some sort  of a grease fire.  I don't know if maybe  you know anything about that. 
[03:03:00]  Perhaps it was.  Whoa!  Perhaps it was.  All right,  you insiders.  You know how restaurants can be.  We've got some insiders.  Ling, ling.  They say stuff that only a few people get.  Ah.  No,  more than a few.  All right,  well,  that sucks for you.  I'm bummed about it,  because it was a very nice place.  No.  You certainly went there a lot.  Yeah.  Hogwax on the nipples.  A crying,  drunk,  homeless man.  Ah!  Wrong! 
[03:03:30]  And creepy gay kid Sam singing.  Happy birthday to you.  Just some of the cringe moments you'll hear on Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony's 2008's cringiest moments.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts.  You know me from ONA,  and that's E-Rock belching and eating mayonnaise in the background.  That's not mayonnaise.  It's Cherry Coke Zero.  Now,  E-Rock,  there's nothing better on the Opie and Anthony show than tormenting one of our guests. 
[03:04:00]  Yes,  because it means they're not tormenting one of the staff.  Exactly.  And so when Mad TV's,  or is that show on the air anymore?  Who?  Formerly of Mad TV.  Who watches at this point?  Who knows?  Bobby Lee.  Yes.  Comedian,  you know,  and Bobby Lee came by the studio  and basically started telling us about how paranoid he gets.  Well,  why does he get paranoid?  Maybe it's because he had a difficult childhood.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe it's from stress in the workplace being a celebrity.  Could be.  Or maybe he's involved in certain substances that would make one paranoid. 
[03:04:30]  Could be.  Allegedly.  Who knows?  It could be anything.  But what we did as a show,  the Opie and Anthony show,  is we take that information,  and instead of kind of looking to help him through it,  we capitalize on it.  And exploit it.  And drive him to the point of near suicide.  Yes.  On the worst of Opie and Anthony 2008's cringiest moments,  Bobby Lee freaks out.  Do you think he'll ever come back?  I hope so.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments.  Yeah.  I'll look back at some of the most uncomfortable, 
[03:05:00]  yet hilarious portions of the show.  Three,  two,  Happy New Year!  Happy New Year!  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments.  Happy New Year.  Time for the line of the day.  Oh,  that fast already.  Oh, shit.  Bobby,  you enjoy your first visit to the Opie and Anthony show?  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah!  Did you guys make up?  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  No,  we're cool,  man.  He's,  yeah.  It was weird.  It's like,  we're friends.  I don't know,  man.  That's what I said.  That was my point.  Yeah.  From the get-go.  We hung out.  You were drunk.  No, it's good,  though.  I haven't seen you guys in a while.  Thanks for having me on.  Were you feeling really hurt that he didn't hug you?  Like a little bit?  Like you've been slighted?  Yeah,  a little bit.  Dude,  give him a really good hug.  Right now?  Really good.  Dude,  you should see everything.  Do you want to see the underwear I'm wearing right now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get naked.  Bobby,  I did Bobby.  Give,  give.  Oh my God. 
[03:06:00]  I was packing,  I had nothing clean.  So you borrowed your girlfriends?  Those are,  yeah.  You want to hug now?  Those aren't yours.  Chick-like.  You want to hug now?  Bobby.  Yeah,  yeah.  Why is he wearing chick?  Bobby.  That's chick underwear.  Those aren't yours.  They are mine.  No,  they're not.  Yes,  they are,  Robert.  You got a pink trim toe.  Bobby,  Bobby,  Bobby,  wait.  Wait,  we can't just casually.  Dude,  I didn't put them on like,  I'm going to wear this on opening Anthony.  No,  I know you don't,  Bobby.  Every time I've seen you,  you always take,  you always take your clothes off,  which is what I love about you.  I don't care. 
[03:06:30]  But are those really men's underwear?  Yes,  they're men's underwear.  Okay.  Just to explain,  just to explain to people listening,  your underwear is like black and white striped women's underwear with a pink trim.  Yeah.  And there's a little,  and they're a little too tiny on the sides.  Yeah.  Yeah,  they're very bikini-ish.  I should have shown them.  They look good.  My bad.  I apologize.  I think they look good.  You still haven't hugged Mike though.  All right,  I'll do it now.  I thought you were going to hug him the underwear,  but I guess we don't get that.  I don't,  um,  see,  everything's okay.  I don't care what kind of underwear people.  Mike slapped him on the back like,  I'm not a faggot.  That was not as good as-  Hold on, 
[03:07:00]  hold on,  Anthony says he doesn't care what kind of underwear people wear.  Underwear people,  I don't,  doesn't bother me.  Why the fuck?  Thank you.  I know,  but it's a little girly though.  I thought it was a little feminine looking,  but who gives a fuck?  Would you wear panties?  I'd wear a fucking like sack panties.  I wear,  what are you doing right now?  It's in my bag.  He wears boxers.  You wear boxers.  I think,  I think everybody else wears boxers.  I prefer briefs.  Tiny buddies.  Boxers don't help after you piss  to keep the piss from going down your fucking to your kneecap.  Shaking does. 
[03:07:30]  What about boxer briefs?  No, no.  I messed up.  It's a good talking point.  You guys are going to talk about it later.  I just think it would be weird.  What?  What happened?  No,  like tomorrow,  you guys are going to talk about my underwear,  like how he's gay and all that stuff.  Oh,  shit.  No,  not.  No,  we won't tomorrow.  That was a really,  thanks,  man.  Why would we do that?  I thought I was comfortable that we were all friends.  I just showed him,  man.  I like him.  No,  man,  there's a vibe here now.  There's a vibe.  Let me see him again.  What,  really?  Yes.  He's underwear.  Dude,  what do you want?  Pull your pants up in the back. 
[03:08:00]  Pull him up in the back.  His underwear are like,  down his ass.  Pull him up in the back.  Bobby's like,  pull him up.  Let me get a picture.  Let me get a picture.  That's kind of.  Move the coffee cup,  too.  Jim.  Bobby,  move the coffee cup.  Not funny a little,  it's funny a little bit,  what?  Yeah,  I like the coffee cup.  It's funny a little bit.  I'm getting your picture.  Hold on a minute.  Bobby,  look over here.  Yeah,  I'm seeing like a,  it's a zebra stripe kind of a thing.  And Marky,  but then the pink trim is a little odd,  but it's just a pink trim,  but you know what?  They're punk rock, 
[03:08:30]  dude.  Yeah,  they're punk.  Yeah,  they're punk.  I like them.  Thanks,  man.  I really appreciate the hug,  though.  I got him a hot topic.  He got him at Ricky's.  At the mall.  Forever 21.  Yeah,  yeah.  Oh,  big rig causes us.  Oh,  my God,  look at that.  Oh,  my underwear cause that.  It's different.  Bobby,  you're going to have to come back tomorrow.  You come back tomorrow.  If you're around and you're not doing anything.  Yeah,  fuck him,  I just want to give you the invite.  That didn't mean get the fuck out now.  Why?  Yeah,  sit down.  The show's not done yet.  I don't know how it works.  We stay until when they get up and leave. 
[03:09:00]  That's when we leave.  Bob Kelly,  he read that perfectly,  by the way.  So now it's really awkward.  What is that?  Bobby Lee.  That was his out.  What?  It's weird now.  What's going on?  I should leave?  Why is it silent?  Because I bombed horribly?  Oh.  Oh,  no,  I don't think you bombed.  I don't even think you're kidding.  It's all about timing.  Maybe I shouldn't have waited two minutes before I bring back something. 
[03:09:30]  And Mike,  you got your stuff on iTunes.  Yeah.  I'm competing with Rob Kelly.  I got two albums.  And you got an off-Broadway thing that's happening.  You got two or four.  I got two and I got a DVD.  Two.  What about the off-Broadway thing?  Oh,  yeah,  Sleepwalk with me.  Yeah,  me and Mike are going to be number one and two today.  Yeah,  we're going to go up the charts above Bo Burnham.  Yeah,  Bo and Dane Cook.  Dane Cook has all four.  Four in the top seven or something.  Yeah,  something like that.  Boy,  that guy really makes a pretty penny. 
[03:10:00]  Hey,  Roland bought one of those shirts,  by the way.  We didn't talk about it on the air.  Yeah?  The Dane Cook shirt.  Yeah,  he was on Jimmy Kimmel,  and he was like,  I can say anything today,  and then tomorrow it's on YouTube,  and then everybody has it.  Yeah,  I could say A semicolon,  what is it?  Don't ask me.  A6.  And tomorrow there'll be a shirt.  There'll be shirts out there.  And the next day,  it was all over the internet,  and then he had shirts.  And now Roland has one.  That's not a semicolon,  though.  That is a full colon. 
[03:10:30]  But Roland got one of the shirts.  This is a Dane Cook shirt.  This is the shirt that he just made up on the spot on Jimmy Kimmel.  He just made up that saying,  and then now he probably made,  what,  $20,000?  How much does that shirt cost?  $20,000?  $45,000.  Did you know what you were buying?  He made $45,000.  $45,000.  Jesus.  Roland,  did you know what you were buying?  I don't know.  It was soft,  so I bought it.  It was soft,  so you bought it.  What concert?  A bunch of trisks.  At the Garden.  Oh, fuck.  At what concert?  I was having a good one. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Did I get you?  Yeah.  Who's concert?  Dane Cook,  when he did The Garden.  You didn't know what that meant?  No.  I didn't know what that meant.  You did?  No.  Because I saw him on Kimmel.  That's why.  You best not fuck.  Bobby, where are you going?  He's turning.  You all right?  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  I started having a panic attack, man.  Why?  No, I started breathing.  I started sweating.  I got to get out of here.  Yeah.  Why are you panicking?  I had a breathing thing.  So we'll fucking deal with it.  Xanax or something?  I had weird breathing things, too.  No, I just started getting it like I was...  He's sweating.  He turned red. 
[03:11:30]  They're not coming in.  They're fine.  He was freaking out  because we weren't talking about him.  No, that's not what it was, man.  The whole thing,  Dane Cook thing,  and then all of a sudden  I didn't know what was going on.  Your color came back.  Well, you were a different color.  You were red.  I was pink,  and now I'm yellow again?  Yeah, you're back to yellow.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry about that.  Well, ask for a coo can do it.  I can.  You can do whatever you want.  Mike thinks you were looking for a attack.  You got to deal with those panic attacks there, Bobby?  No, no.  I was actually going to leave.  I understand where you're coming from.  I have that, too, man. 
[03:12:00]  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  Bobby, where are you going?  Bobby.  My thing cut off.  Bobby.  Bobby, sit down.  You get panic attacks?  Yeah.  I get that.  There's a lot of stuff.  I don't know where he just got up and started panicking, sweating.  His face turned beet red, and he was walking out of here.  It's called a panic attack.  Yeah.  You all right?  How do I know?  You all right?  Someone just handed him the ratings for Mad TV.  Oh, jeez.  Wow, you are fucking brutal, man. 
[03:12:30]  Look, man, I don't even have a show.  I'm just making funny.  I don't have your career.  Come on.  I don't have a...  Is this on?  Can you hear me?  Oh, yeah.  Why, your headphones aren't working?  Nothing's working.  That's what happened.  No, the headphones aren't working.  Hey, anyone else...  Probably need another battery in that son of a bitch.  Anyone else feel that?  What?  How was that?  Oh, my God.  You feel the room shake?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was that?  Earthquake.  What was that?  I have no idea. 
[03:13:00]  I'm sure Steve dropped the ball again.  Bobby, you feel that?  Wow.  No.  Were you sweating?  You didn't feel the room shake?  Oh, my God.  I'm getting dizzy.  Yeah, it feels like a little mean earthquake.  Yeah, that was weird, dude.  What the hell was that?  You can't have...  I don't know.  You all right?  That's weird.  In New York City, Jesus.  You felt that?  Yeah, dude, that's weird.  Nothing.  Why don't we just try to end this as quick as we can get to the phone?  Yeah, come on.  Let's just do it.  You all right, Bobby?  Yeah, you said the shaking.  It stopped.  It was shaking, though. 
[03:13:30]  Mars, why?  This is a floating room, right?  Yes.  Yeah, the room floats, so...  It's suspended?  Yeah.  We're going to be safe?  Yeah.  You sure?  We'll see.  Oh, of course.  What do you mean, we'll see?  You went from yep to we'll see to what?  No?  To nowhere goners.  Bobby, you know what's really weird about this studio?  What?  There's a fucking 40-story crane right outside this building, and man, if one of those brackets  goes...  Did you hear that?  It happened to not...  This goes right through the fucking studio.  It happened to Israel the other day.  It was by Terrace.  Look out of Anthony's window.  I'm not kidding.  Terrace did it.  You've got to see this, Bobby.  It freaks us out every day. 
[03:14:00]  Look at this thing.  That's not good.  Yeah, those things...  I've got to go.  What's wrong with you?  Those things fall down all the time.  No, honestly, I'm like...  There's some weirds going on now.  We're almost done.  This is not working.  No, it's not.  We can hear you.  It's just your headphones.  Your headphones aren't working.  He's right.  The mic's not working.  Mars, can you fix his mic?  It's not working.  No, I can't hear nothing.  Yeah.  Are we still on?  Are we on the air?  What's going on?  We haven't been on the air in 15 minutes.  Oh, we haven't?  No.  You can leave. 
[03:14:30]  It's good meeting you.  Bobby.  Oh, are you mad now?  Fucking Bobby.  We love you, man.  Take a deep breath.  It's water.  Yeah, get some water in you.  You know, the studio shook a little bit,  and we've got a crane that might topple over.  We're cool.  It hasn't toppled over yet,  so I don't think today's the day.  No, but that happens a lot for me.  It's hot in here.  I just start sweating and stuff,  and it's weird.  Anyone else see the cockroaches?  Yeah. 
[03:15:00]  They'll fucking get rid of them.  I hate cockroaches, dude.  Where the fuck are cockroaches?  Cockroach.  The studio's been infested with them  because of construction.  Yeah, the construction  and the fucking disgusting,  deplorable conditions  over by that refrigerator.  The food was like  snotty smashed  against the fucking door.  They live in chairs.  Yes, wasn't it?  These chairs.  They live in chairs.  What the fuck are you talking about?  The stuffing of the chairs  is what they live in chairs.  That's where they lay their eggs,  in chairs.  You're out of your fucking mind.  Google it. 
[03:15:30]  Google it.  Swear to God.  They live in walls.  Swear to God.  Couches.  They live everywhere.  First of all,  they live fucking everywhere.  But they live under cabinets,  in cabinets,  in the walls.  They don't live in chairs.  But they can't live in chairs  is what he's saying.  Not in Bob's chair.  Nothing can live in his chair.  They lay eggs in mattresses  and things.  It is true.  Furniture.  I liked it a lot.  Well, yeah,  because they're everywhere.  They're fucking cockroaches.  But they don't fucking scurry  to the chair  when you turn the light on.  Maybe I was being serious. 
[03:16:00]  Maybe I was just playing along  with the game  and trying to, you know.  No, that's really...  They do.  Fuck with me.  I don't know, Anthony.  Someone playing in a cockroach.  Maybe you can just stick to the plan.  See, that's what's making me sweat  this whole banter,  this whole thing.  The fuck?  What is that?  What was that?  What are you talking about?  Did you see that?  What happened?  I want to eat...  What?  What the fuck is going on?  Is that building just shake?  What?  I felt something.  I got to piss.  Bobby, honestly, though,  there are cockroaches in here.  I got to piss. 
[03:16:30]  First of all,  hold on.  Honestly,  that dropped ceiling,  we know there's cockroaches  up in there,  so just be careful.  But something is moving  or something.  It's weird.  Keep the fucking shit  over there  as far as the cockroaches  are concerned  because we haven't seen  any in the studio yet.  And if I see one  in this fucking studio  because I do not want  to have shit  come home with me,  that's for sure.  Because that's what'll happen.  You bring a bag in here  from home.  I got to get out of here, man.  Where are you going?  What's wrong?  Something weird is happening.  I think I'm tired or something.  What are you talking about? 
[03:17:00]  Tired?  I didn't sleep well last night.  I had like two hours of sleep.  And I'm literally like,  my whole thing is like...  What, your EQ?  Did this thing move?  What are you talking about?  Are you all right, dude?  Are you flipping out?  No, I'm flipping out.  Are you flipping out?  I got to get out of here.  What's wrong with you?  Dude, I'm losing my mind, man.  Sit down.  I'm sweating, man.  Sit at 20,000 pounds.  There is something going on here.  Sit at 20,000 pounds.  First of all, I just want to say,  I'm not...  We're probably off the air.  That's fine.  No, we're not.  We're on the air.  We're on the air?  Yeah, we told you that.  First of all, let me just say this. 
[03:17:30]  The mic is not working.  I can't hear myself.  We can hear you.  And then I just...  My whole level of...  I feel like something's shaking  or something's going on.  No, something did shake  in the studio.  But that was a while ago.  I have to piss.  Is everything cool?  Yeah.  Does he have headphones?  I feel like I'm...  I just saw it.  What are you talking about?  You're freaking me out.  Bobby.  Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby, at least leave the studio.  Bobby, relax.  Is the table moving?  No.  How fun is he? 
[03:18:00]  Is the table moving?  This is a half ton.  How can we move this fucking thing?  Hey, dude.  Just sit down.  Relax.  You're freaking me out.  You're freaking me out.  Just be fine, dude.  Chill out just a little bit.  It's all good.  Look, I'm checking email.  How could all hell be breaking the list  if I'm checking email?  Are you on Sally D?  Yeah, maybe Sally D.  You guys want to do...  Jimmy went to the bathroom.  Bobby Lee thinks things are moving around  in the studio.  Is it floored or something?  No.  Everything's good, Bobby. 
[03:18:30]  All right?  Bobby's probably...  Because I've been tired, too,  and my equilibrium gets a little fucking thrown.  But his headphones aren't working.  We can hear you on mic.  Don't worry about that.  All right.  It's fine.  Okay.  And watch out.  Honestly, that drop ceiling does have cockroaches.  We haven't seen any today yet.  The ceiling drops?  Well, it is a drop ceiling already.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  So...  Anyone else see the beekeeper?  All right.  That's it. 
[03:19:00]  This is moving now.  I just saw it.  Listen.  Oh, my God.  He's losing his mind.  And you know what?  That's messed up because, listen...  How could this thing move?  Look how big this thing is, Bobby.  It's either that or I'm going crazy, dude,  and I need to go and take a nap.  What are you seeing, really?  Seriously.  I'm seeing either the floor is moving up...  Right.  ...or this is moving,  or I'm literally like...  Bobby, you see how much...  I'm going to New York or something.  You see how big this table is  and all this equipment?  How is all this going to move?  Seriously. 
[03:19:30]  Why is everybody leaving the building?  Huh?  Why is all these...  The office is empty now.  All right, dude.  I've got to get out of here, dude.  Are you serious?  Are they all in front of you?  There's something going on.  Honestly, thank you so much  for having me on.  Where are you going?  Bobby.  I've got to get out of here, man.  For what?  No, there's something going on here.  Like...  Where are they?  No, no, no, no.  Why is everyone leaving?  See, that's the thing.  Oh, crap.  I've got to leave.  When people leave, I leave.  You know what I mean?  Why?  I'll let them leave.  Dude, they're just leaving.  Hey, did you sleep at all last night? 
[03:20:00]  What's wrong with this guy?  I'm just staring at him.  I'm trying to figure him out.  Oh, shit.  All right, can we do line of the day?  Yeah, let's get line of the day.  Bobby out of here.  Why did the audience leave?  What?  Am I acting crazy right now?  No, I mean, you just...  I don't know.  Are you all right?  You fine, dude?  You fine.  Nah, everybody's fine.  Let me...  Oh, fuck. 
[03:20:30]  What happened to the TVs?  Oh, shit.  No video signal.  What the fuck's that about?  Oh, that's fucking great.  Oh, jeez.  Now, I want to...  I think I'm going to go.  This is like a fucking submarine.  Mike, where are you going, Mike?  It's like a submarine fucking...  It's a...  Everybody left.  How is it?  No, I'm saying...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Guys, wait, no.  I've seen this on the news and stuff.  Promote your show, dude.  No, I already did it.  It's like a fucking...  Bobby, Bobby.  You guys...  No, you guys are going to talk like...  It's like a submarine with a hull breach.  You know...  Well, it is...  There's something weird definitely going on.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:21:00]  Wow.  Mike...  Mike Birbigli is preventing him from leaving.  Yeah, Mike's preventing him.  I like that, actually.  We're going to...  We're going to just stay a couple more minutes, and then we'll go.  Bobby, come back.  We love you.  We want you to come back on the show.  Why are people leaving?  And then I feel like...  How are we playing a trick on you?  We're doing a radio show.  They left.  I don't know why.  The lights went out.  I don't know why.  We lost the TV signal.  I don't know why.  And I did feel something, but that was a while ago, and you're still seeing things. 
[03:21:30]  But you did have a little panic attack before, so it's probably like the residuals.  All right, let's...  Are we almost ready for the line of the day?  I hate being cut off like this.  Bob?  Yeah.  He's closing his eyes.  Yeah, relax a little bit, bro.  Chill out.  Breathe.  Bam.  No.  What's that?  All right.  What do we do?  Bobby, why are you covering your eyes?  I'm fine.  Are you okay? 
[03:22:00]  What the fuck is that?  My God.  What's what?  There's a bunny rabbit.  What?  Where?  Where's there a bunny rabbit?  I know.  This is like...  You guys are putting tricks on me, man.  Where is there a bunny rabbit?  How could we be playing tricks on you, Bobby?  We're not that type of broadcast.  What are you talking about?  You smell that?  No, there's a bunny rabbit.  Do you smell...  Where?  There's a bunny rabbit.  Where? 
[03:22:30]  Robert, there's a bunny rabbit.  I can't see a fucking bunny rabbit, Bobby.  You're fucking with me now?  You're fucking with me.  You're fucking with me.  Dude, I know what's going on.  Yeah.  I know what's going on now.  And that's good that you did that.  All right, show us the bunny rabbit.  Where is there a bunny rabbit?  Show us the bunny rabbit.  Show me the bunny rabbit.  I'm with you.  Yeah, show us.  Show me the bunny rabbit.  Show us.  Out there somewhere?  All right, I'm leaving.  Where are you going?  I got to get out of here.  Come on, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Thanks for having me on the show.  Baby, wait.  Are you going to come back tomorrow?  All right.  Bobby. 
[03:23:00]  All right, there goes Bobby Lee.  And he's looking for the bunny rabbit.  Bobby.  Where are you going?  He ran out.  He ran out.  No, no, I'm going because there's something going on.  He ran out of the studio to go find the bunny.  No, no, no, I got to go.  What's wrong?  And the bunny...  No, no, no.  I love those guys.  I'm sweating.  I got to get out of here.  I got to go to sleep.  What are you doing?  They want to talk to him.  No, no, no, I'm done.  They didn't say you can leave.  No, no.  They didn't say you can leave.  Rules are rules, man.  It's like, there's no rules.  I got to eat.  No, no, no.  I did.  I did it like two hours. 
[03:23:30]  It was fun.  The funniest thing.  Tell him we're going to breakfast.  The funniest thing.  He wasn't...  No, I'm having a panic attack.  I got to get out of here.  Is he coming back?  What are you doing?  No, no, no.  I wasn't going to go.  The elevator.  All right.  Let him go on the elevator.  Yeah, what's up?  Tell him we're going to breakfast.  No, I can't come back, guys.  Why?  Because there's some sort of deception and some shadow play going on, and I'm not in on it,  and you know what?  I'm going to get you guys back. 
[03:24:00]  There's deception.  What type of shadow play is going on there?  The elevator door's shut.  Oh, well.  He's done?  There he is.  Dude, he wasn't sure if the bunny rabbit was real, so he ran out of the studio, because  that was the only way he could figure it out, was to find the bunny rabbit, and whoever  was in the bunny rabbit suit to tear down a wall right now was able to hide, and he  never found the bunny rabbit, and that really just freaked him the fuck out.  You don't need to tear down the wall.  I don't think anybody thought there was a giant bunny rabbit. 
[03:24:30]  Let me tear the wall down here.  But the thing I do want to add was I was like, fuck, he's going to find the bunny, and  he never found the bunny, so.  Nice.  We don't treat our guests nicely.  Yeah.  We really don't.  And we were moving the console up and down.  It was the first time he was in here, and the console's moving up and down.  Fake earthquake.  Yeah, you've got to get him back in tomorrow.  It's Opie and Anthony's Cringe Moments. 
[03:25:00]  You'll laugh so hard you just might soil yourself.  It's Opie and Anthony's Cringe Moments.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, 2008 cringiest moments.  E-Rock, primetime Sam Roberts here with you.  Derek's still annoyed sitting in the corner.  And we're going to one of my favorite bits that we do on the show here, because I get  to participate in this one. 
[03:25:30]  This is where you shine, actually.  More than participate.  You finally do something well.  By imitating somebody else's profession.  Yeah.  This is, of course, the franchise O&A bit that we started.  The new generation franchise O&A was started in 2008.  Basically, Opie and Anthony found out that they had to interview David Tyree.  Of the New York Giants.  About 30 minutes before Mr. Tyree came to the studio, they said, all this guy did was  write a book about one catch he made. 
[03:26:00]  There's no way we want to talk to him.  Yes.  Now, our guest booker at the time said, well, we can't cancel him.  He's coming in a half hour.  Yes.  So they said, okay, he obviously isn't going to know the show.  We're going to run out of the room and sit a new Opie and Anthony in our places.  So let's look at the aftermath and what happened after Patrice's words and Opie and Anthony's  decision, they put the new Opie and Anthony in place to interview David Tyree of New York  Giants.  If I can say.  You can.  The next generation of O and A franchise, I think the best. 
[03:26:30]  Obviously, yes.  The first one was a decent model, but didn't really develop.  I would have said subpar.  You know what?  You're right.  Subpar.  Yeah.  Almost shameful.  Terrible.  Yes.  But this is better.  It's on the worst of Opie and Anthony, 2008's cringiest moments.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments.  I'll look back at some of the most uncomfortable yet hilarious portions of the show.  From the bottom of my heart, I hope you have a healthy and a happy new year.  Oh. 
[03:27:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments.  That's right.  We're laughing at you, stupid.  He's here.  He's quiet.  Seriously?  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  What are we doing now?  He's not in there, though?  He's in the bathroom.  Oh, go.  Hide me too, rabbit.  Hide me too.  All right.  The franchise version of the Opie and Anthony show.  Here it goes.  Oh, make...  Quick.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  I'm in the middle of the show.  I'm just sitting in a chair, dude. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, go.  All right.  Hey, Ope.  I'm Ant.  Oh, hey, Ant.  Here comes Opie.  Sorry about that interruption.  So, Ope, who do we have coming in next?  Uh, we've got, uh, David Tyree?  Tyree?  Oh.  The football guy.  Yeah, he made that catch. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  I tell you...  It's a book.  I don't usually watch football, but I saw that Super Bowl, and it was incredible, that catch.  Is that all he's famous for?  Well, I mean, it was a famous catch in the Super Bowl, Ope.  Where is he?  I thought they were bringing him in.  Yeah, do we have, uh, David Tyree coming in at all?  Steve!  Get Steve.  Yes.  Is anyone working back there?  He's in production.  I'm gay.  Steve.  I thought you said David Tyree was here. 
[03:28:30]  He's using the facility, guys.  I was busy staring at him.  I will fire you.  I will fire you.  You do not pour water on me.  Sorry, I was going to pour water on you.  How about talking to a mic that works, Steve?  How about potting one up that works?  Yeah, it's on.  You don't talk to...  Yes, I do.  We'll both fire you.  Why are we talking to Steve?  Where's David Tyree?  Steve, get David Tyree.  Why threaten to fire people so much?  It's Opie's job. 
[03:29:00]  Wow.  So we're killing time here is what you're saying.  Where's E-Rock?  Eating somewhere?  Probably.  Fat piece of shit crying over in some manner.  Whatever.  Alright, we're killing time.  Oh, here he is.  David Tyree.  David Tyree.  What's going on?  Welcome to the show, sir.  Take a seat.  How you doing?  I'm Opie.  Alright.  Anthony, sir. 
[03:29:30]  Pleasure to meet you.  Thanks for the season, gentlemen.  How you doing?  Oh, stop it.  Hang it, man.  Hang it.  We the first you're talking to today?  Or have you come somewhere else?  No, I'm hanging out over Channel 11 for a hot minute.  Ah.  CW11.  We know them very well.  Very well.  Yes, we have some history.  Yes.  That's what's up.  So, David.  What's the deal?  You're promoting a book.  Yeah.  It would be nice if we had a copy of the book somewhere.  Oh, there's one right there.  I think I have one. 
[03:30:00]  Take my note.  Take a look at that there.  I've read it already.  More than just the catch.  Yeah.  Want to fill us in a little bit about this book here?  It's a little bit of everything, you know?  All the crazy stuff that I went through in my life, you know, stemming from just a crazy  young kid growing up, drugs, alcohol, mostly marijuana, all that, you know, all the stuff  that we do.  I know a little about that.  A little bit about that?  Yes.  A little or a lot.  Oh, you know, here and there.  Yeah.  So, you know, basically kind of the struggles that I have. 
[03:30:30]  Right, Danny?  Getting up to that point, you know, obviously being in the NFL, it's not a good mixture,  you know?  Mm-hmm.  And so, you know, I basically got arrested, marijuana possession, and that's kind of what  led me to my faith and things like that.  Very nice.  Going through some of the photos here.  Oh, yeah.  I got some classics in there.  You dress up pretty nice.  Every now and then, you know?  Oh, maybe.  Well, you don't need to flirt with him, Ope.  For this one here.  What's this one all about?  You throwing up a gang sign?  Oh, yeah.  That's like my Jim Jones. 
[03:31:00]  I don't need to listen to a camera.  I didn't dip set much.  Ah, dip set.  Yes.  Yes.  Dip set is a go.  Yeah.  I was a big fan of the dip set back then, so I was just acting a fool back in the crib.  I see.  I keep it fun, you know?  So, you say you found your faith.  Yeah.  Do you credit that for making this catch, which we're looking at on the cover of the book?  Oh, definitely.  Well, you know, yeah.  You know, obviously, you know, a lot of people, when I say it, people get a little wacko,  like, well, you did make the catch.  I didn't know I made the catch.  I was kind of there.  You know, so, you know, I just, what I mean is that there's no way, you know, human talent 
[03:31:30]  can make that catch.  You know, it's not like I can prepare for it.  You know, I can go in the park and catch balls on my helmet.  You know, so that's what I say, you know, when God did it.  Why do you think God was on the side of the Giants?  No, I never said God was on the side of the Giants.  I just said that, you know, people misconstrue that as well.  It's not God was on our side.  God is looking out for anybody that's, you know, that's not willing to fame his name.  You know what I'm saying?  Unless you're a patriot. 
[03:32:00]  There was some pretty good patriots.  I saw some patriots out there that was crushed.  But, you know, the will of God is just the will of God, you know, whether we win or lose.  I see, I see, I see.  How are you recovering from your knee injury here?  I'm ready to go, man.  I've been ready to go for a couple weeks.  First, I was a little upset about being on PUP to begin with.  But, you know, it gave me a little more extra time than I needed, you know, to be strong.  And I'll be out this week, and then I should be back next week.  I wanted to ask you, Michael Strahan is now an analyst for Fox. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  He just made his pick for the season, saying that Dallas is going all the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, we were both on the same team last year.  How are you taking that?  No, you know, he's got a job to do.  But, you know, it sucked.  I thought he could have went out there and gave us a little bit of love for the first one.  But at the same time, you know, he got a job to do.  And, you know, he just go out there and do his job, and we do all.  You know, if we could get my brother, Elmo, big fan of the Giants, just obsessed with his team. 
[03:33:00]  If we can get him on the phone sometime, I know we have a lot of questions he'd like to ask you.  Oh, sweet.  Mars, why isn't this monitor working?  Again?  It's...  Oh, there it goes.  Go ahead, over.  I'm sorry.  Oh, there's no problem.  Yeah, so it's just odd.  Michael is...  We haven't had him on in a while, but he used to come on the show regularly.  Big Mike makes Trey, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's big time now.  How is he doing as far as...  I don't want to go into too much detail, but like his things that were going on with his personal life last year. 
[03:33:30]  Has he discussed any of that with you?  No, he never discussed it.  You know, he's not ashamed of it.  So, you know, he'll willingly say...  He'll willingly say, you know, he made every conscious effort that she wouldn't get all his money.  But at the same time, you know, things worked out the way they did.  That's his personal business.  I don't really do too much getting into that stuff.  No?  No, that's a little dangerous, you know.  Especially when the guy weighs me by about 80 pounds, I'll leave it alone.  How are you feeling about Jerry Rice as a player?  Ah, well, he was my childhood hero, to be honest with you. 
[03:34:00]  I was never a New York fan.  I was a 49ers fan because I grew up, you know, late 80s.  The Niners was running the show, so...  Because sometimes around here we go, we do an impression.  Jerry Dice.  Jerry Dice.  Jerry Dice.  Yeah.  That was new.  I never got that one.  Yeah.  But Jerry Rice, he's a solid dude.  You ever met him?  No, no.  We just do Jerry Dice.  You know?  Phenomenal.  Yeah.  But, yeah, that's pretty much it. 
[03:34:30]  Loving this book here.  I do have to ask you about Plaxico.  Oh, yeah.  That's the latest.  How do you say?  Barass?  Barass?  Yeah, Burse.  Burse.  Burse.  Burse.  He was suspended for missing practice, allegedly saying that he took his kids to school.  That was the excuse for why he missed practice.  Okay.  Do you know anything about that?  That's the first I heard because, you know, I'm just, you know, I don't read too much papers.  I knew, you know, I just, I'm reading here, it's supposedly a bizarre excuse. 
[03:35:00]  That's tough, you know?  That's tough.  You know, we men that don't get a chance to do that too often.  And so, if that's the case, I got a little, I got sympathy for it.  But, yeah, at the same time, you know, he's a grown man and we're grown enough to make  decisions for ourselves.  You know, and that's what we got to do.  You know, you got to make decisions.  If you know you got to be at work, it's eventually going to cost you.  But, hey, you just got a new contract.  Have you mispracticed?  Legitimate reason or not.  But has that ever happened to you at any point in your career?  Oh, yeah.  My rookie year, heck yeah.  I got, I was like leading the team in fines in my rookie year when I was, you know, just a wreck 
[03:35:30]  that year.  Yeah.  You know, I think I had about $10,000 in fines, but it should have been $40,000.  Nothing during your college days?  I see that you went to Syracuse.  Our old Anthony went to Syracuse.  Did you?  No, I didn't even graduate high school.  Oh, that was supposed to be the setup.  Yeah, no, I didn't graduate high school.  In radio, we can do that, make this career.  There's no reason.  That's phenomenal.  We have a fan somewhere outside that wants to say.  One fan?  Yeah.  I'm good for one. 
[03:36:00]  Where is he?  Yeah, hi, this is Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Sure, and I'm watching the show today.  Opie, you're such a phony.  You were saying how much the Giants sock and big blue blows and all that.  You're a Jets fan.  I am a big Jets fan.  And here you are kissing David Tyree's ass.  I don't really understand the phoniness that's going on here.  Well, leave it to Stephen S. from Bayshore to sell out, Opie.  David, I have to level with you.  I am a Jets fan.  Grew up on Long Island. 
[03:36:30]  Hey, man, you mad at you, dude?  You're in the prime of your life right now.  Brett Favre's in town.  Yeah, well, I'm not too big a supporter of Brett Favre, either.  I think he's a big sellout.  Tell him what you were saying the other day, you know, that this guy's a one-hit wonder.  I mean, all he has in his career is one catch.  You were saying it just the other day.  All right, Opie, if you could maybe pop that mic down a bit.  Way to make me feel big about myself here.  This is what I love about satellite radio.  I was just saying that I thought, you know, book, because you caught a football on your head. 
[03:37:00]  You know, what's the deal?  What's the deal?  Why a book?  Why a book?  Yeah.  Because I got a story to tell.  Why the hell you got a radio show?  Every day we wonder the same thing.  They keep paying us.  That's it.  Do you think anybody could have predicted that catch that you made?  No.  That's the best part about it.  Because I think the only way you could have predicted a catch like that is if you had had some kind of sports almanac, like Biff Tannen did.  If you could get, like, a time machine. 
[03:37:30]  Biff.  I'm going to tune out for 20 minutes there.  Head to the future.  Get the sports almanac.  I'm sure there would be a little footnote in there about that catch,  because it would obviously say, you know, the Giants ended the Patriots, you know, winning streak.  Definitely.  And I'll bet I could create an entire museum dedicated to myself based on the money that I would get from that prediction as well as others.  That would be phenomenal because I saw it in the movie with you, the sequel.  Yeah.  Which is your favorite back to the future? 
[03:38:00]  Part two.  Really?  Yeah.  All the futuristic, the hoverboards, phenomenal.  Yeah.  Can't beat it.  We had a guest in that their favorite was part three.  They weren't invited back.  Thank you.  No.  Where did they get the logs to power the train?  I don't even remember.  I don't think part three got another.  I didn't even give it another watch.  No.  No.  Part one and two are phenomenal.  Yeah.  Do you want to take a phone call?  A couple of listeners calling in, some supporters. 
[03:38:30]  Some supporters.  Maybe not this one.  We're on in Boston.  Okay, good.  And so this is Brian in Mass.  Brian?  You're on with Mike.  Ah, with David Tyree.  Sorry.  Hello?  Hi, Brian.  Hi, yes, David.  Quick question.  I love the book.  It's called The Catch, correct?  Yeah, more than just The Catch.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a Patriots fan, and I was just looking at some stats online.  Can you tell me about the other three catches last year?  Other three catches.  What's the point of talking about those?  I don't know.  I just saw online.  There was a four-catch season last year? 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  What happened to the other three catches?  Do they have a chapter?  Boy, you just really missed the whole season, didn't you?  Like, I didn't even, the four catches didn't even matter.  Isn't that the whole gist of it?  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yeah, geez.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  Nice try, Brian.  This isn't a book about all the catches.  He caught the thing on his head with his fingertips, for God's sake.  Let's talk to, from Yellowstone, Lady Trucker.  Lady. 
[03:39:30]  Hello.  Hello, David?  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey, how old were you when you first played football?  When I first played, I don't know, 11 or 12.  Oh, no.  David believes the shit that Whitehall Shrink babbles.  I don't even know what that meant.  I don't even know what that meant.  Sometimes we get prank callers here.  Of course.  And there's not much we could do about it, except maybe talk to a different phone screener.  You know what I mean?  I'm sorry about that. 
[03:40:00]  It's the good stuff.  I like this.  Let's talk to, take one more here.  Cody in Indiana.  Cody.  Cody.  Hello.  Yeah.  Hi, David.  How are you?  What's going on, Cody?  Hey, I know that you probably think that it's all part of divine intervention for an amazing  catch like that.  Was it anything like the movie Angels in the Outfield to you?  Anything like Angels in the Outfield?  I don't know if you could see my angels.  Yeah.  I mean, Christopher Lloyd is just amazing.  I think he crystallizes an experience like that perfectly. 
[03:40:30]  And if it was anything like that, I mean, that's amazing.  Well, we all know Christopher Lloyd's amazing.  He created the flux capacitor, after all.  You know?  Yeah.  Well, have a good day, David.  Thank you.  Hey, take it easy, boss.  I mean, who would have thought that one person could take a car like the DeLorean?  You know?  And then a little plutonium, a flux capacitor.  A flux capacitor.  And, you know, it's flying through the sky.  That's phenomenal.  Into the future.  88 miles per hour is all you need. 
[03:41:00]  Can't beat that.  They could send a dog, Einstein.  They could send, you know.  That's a nice setup.  Oh, well, yeah.  This is our very own XM studio.  Serious XM now, I guess, since the merger.  But, yeah, they built this studio just for us in the Ron and Fez show that comes on after us from noon to 3.  This is sweet.  Yes.  Another question about a teammate of yours.  Tiki Barber.  Oh, yeah.  Tiki Dog.  Career suicide going to the Today Show.  Missed out on the ring.  He did.  You guys still talk to him?  Yeah, we still talk to him. 
[03:41:30]  You know, I think he's had enough, you know, you know, I'm sure he's, I don't want to say he's regretting the situation, but, you know, it was kind of rough when he threw us under the bus at the beginning of the season.  You know, we started off 0-2 and he's like, Giants are pitiful.  And, you know, so I think those, you know, you know, he paid for it, you know, and there's no reason for us to rub it in his face.  You know, he did some good things for us.  Yeah.  I think we have another audience member who has a question.  What's the deal?  You're on.  How could you?  Where is he?  Softballs at this guy. 
[03:42:00]  David, do you know that that OP guy right there, he doesn't believe in God and he makes fun of people that believe in God.  There we go.  That's why I'm here.  That's what I'm here for.  Yeah.  We're not practicing going to church-wise, but I don't think I'm totally not into the God thing.  I just, I'm very skeptical.  I can understand people who are skeptics.  You know what?  You got reason to be skeptics.  You know, when you look at so many hypocrites out there, it's a lot of hypocrites.  That's a lot of reason. 
[03:42:30]  And since we're sharing, I got to admit something else.  This is a confession.  This is sweet.  You're already into it, bro.  This is Greg Hughes, the actor who plays Opie.  I know I said I was a Jets fan.  I really haven't been into football for a while now.  I'm all about the Tiger Woods golf.  You playing that?  No.  I'm on the PS3.  I suck in games.  I suck in video games.  It's not, you know, what's the Madden rule?  It's like 21-0 and you're off, right?  Yeah.  You're off the sticks.  I gave up like three years ago.  They just kept 21 skunking me. 
[03:43:00]  Well, if you get the new Tiger Woods, I'm XMOP on there.  Okay.  You like to befriend me on the PS3 network?  I do have the PS3, you know, even though I rarely get on.  Now, when that ball was coming down from the sky, did you feel like it looked almost like a missile coming from a ship?  Like, you know.  The Enola Gay is dropping bombs on the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It was like Chariots of Fire, dude.  Yeah.  I had like a soundtrack playing in the background while it's in the air.  Like Hiroshima. 
[03:43:30]  Right?  Yeah.  It was wild, man.  Wow.  We got some outstanding sound effects.  Come on.  We tried to keep production value.  Our interns obviously sit there reading papers.  They're interns?  Yeah.  That's one of our interns.  It's Sam.  Wow.  But he's phenomenal.  What's going on, Sam?  Obviously, he does nothing but sit on the couch and read the paper, you know?  That's great.  I get water.  Yeah.  Thanks, Sam.  We got the water.  Thank you.  So, touch back on the book for a tiny bit here.  Yeah.  Like he touched on the football. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, you're quick.  Yes.  Books on tape?  You got anything in the works?  Are you going to voice it?  I probably got it.  You're going to get somebody a little more voice experience or something?  Yeah.  That's not my thing, you know?  And why don't you do the book on tape?  That'd be sweet.  Why don't you give them a little example there?  Yeah.  Give them a little flavor.  Okay.  Well, for instance, like Ronald Reagan might read the book and say, like,  well, this book is a story of the life of a man who lives. 
[03:44:30]  This book is a story of the...  This book is...  I just, you know, it's because he has Alzheimer's.  Oh, God.  That's a good story.  Well, he did.  Oh, I'm getting a communicator.  Obviously, he's dead now.  Oh, Ope is on his cell phone.  Yeah.  I guess Ope is...  Hey, what's wrong?  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Oh, boy. 
[03:45:00]  How's...  I don't know.  How's the book been doing in terms of sales and stuff?  I don't know.  Last I heard was the first week.  It was like 12,000 the first week.  Oh, that's great.  Is it?  I don't know.  I haven't sold any books.  Okay.  I was waiting for somebody to tell me it was doing all right.  But, you know, it's cool, whether it does good or right.  Well, it's 12,000 more than I've sold.  Well, I don't have a radio show, so you got me on that deal.  Well, maybe we'll sell some more books today.  Yeah, why don't you give the big book for the book there?  More Than Just a Catch, More Than Just The Catch, A True Story of Courage, Hope, and Achieving 
[03:45:30]  the Impossible by David Tyree with Kimberly Daniels.  Who's Kimberly Daniels?  She's like my spiritual mom, you know.  Oh, okay.  You know, she just pours into my life, you know.  It keeps me going high.  All right.  I got to communicate here that they're telling us he has to go.  Sweet.  Where are you off to now?  You doing television?  No, no television.  I think I'm pretty much done for the day.  Come out and hang out.  You know, it's not, you know, I don't think it's that big of a deal. 
[03:46:00]  We can hang out for a few moments.  Okay, great.  If one thing before you go, if you could help us.  Anthony rarely asks for photos.  He's a little intimidated and embarrassed by that.  Could we get a photo for Opie's Eye with you and Anthony there?  We can hang out.  We can do it.  You want to do it live on the air here?  All right, Opie.  Let's do it live on the air.  Let's get a photo.  I like this, dude.  Are all these mics on?  Yeah, they're all on.  All right.  We'll take this one.  I thought they were all on.  Yeah.  Let's get a photo right there.  Thank you.  Line's up nice. 
[03:46:30]  There we go.  Thank you very much.  David Tyree.  That was an awesome dude.  More than just the catch book is out now.  Go out and get it.  It won't burn you.  Yes.  Thank you so much for coming in.  We're going to take a break.  We'll be right back.  It's Opie and Anthony's cringe moments.  You'll laugh so hard you just might soil yourself.  It's Opie and Anthony's cringe moments.  Bye, Derek. 
[03:47:00]  Derek couldn't take any more of the 2008 cringiest moments on the worst of Opie and Anthony,  so he's going home.  You know, one of the key things that makes the Opie and Anthony show the Opie and Anthony  show is the variety, and one of the elements is stunts.  And it wouldn't be a recap of 2008's cringiest moments without what I think was 2008's best  stunt.  Maybe the best stunt that's ever happened on the show.  Why is that?  Because Opie did it.  Oh, that's why?  No, because it was performed to excellence. 
[03:47:30]  It was the stunt that everybody said it'll never happen.  Nobody saw it coming.  They said it's all T's.  I prefer to think that this was the best stunt ever because of the way it was executed by  those who were involved in executing it.  Well, now you're just tooting your own horn.  I didn't say it was me.  Was it you?  It was me.  Yeah.  Well.  And Rich Voss.  That's true.  It was the baby diaper mustache.  Opie had made an open challenge a couple of times.  He said, if anyone has a baby, come down to the studio today only.  Bring that dirty diaper, and I'll wear what's in the diaper as a mustache. 
[03:48:00]  And I knew Voss was in town because he was coming by later to cut some promos for me.  Right, because he had done this before.  Opie had done this before knowing that nobody would ever bring a baby.  Yeah.  So he tried, he got a little cocky, did it for either a second or third time, I don't  remember, and you made the call.  Yeah.  And Voss arrived.  Couldn't get here fast enough.  Dirty diaper in hand.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the baby diaper mustache on the worst of Opie and Anthony 2008's 
[03:48:30]  cringiest moments.  Poo.  Poo.  Let's take a look back at Opie and Anthony's cringe moments.  A selection of segments that'll make you stare at the radio and say,  What the F was that?  Holy crap, I'm done.  I guess you just heard what you thought you heard.  It's Opie and Anthony's cringe moments.  Oh, Jesus Christ, what the fuck is he doing here?  Oh my God, please.  Oh no!  All right, I know what the fuck he did. 
[03:49:00]  I know what the fuck he did.  My heart just stopped.  Yes, and it should.  What's that?  Do you have Bonnie and the baby?  First of all, I always have a heart of Bonnie and the baby with me, whether they're here  or not.  Okay?  So what are you saying?  Do I have Bonnie?  Do you see Bonnie with me, stupid?  Oh, I'm breathing.  Do you understand?  I would love fucking...  You have no idea.  Do you understand?  What?  You have no idea, do you, stupid?  Holy crap.  He has no clue.  What?  My heart, I'm not even joking, just stopped.  What's that?  Can you please play it for him?  Oh my God.  All right, I'll play this for you. 
[03:49:30]  It's very obvious he has no clue and I'm off the hook.  Holy shit, I saw your face.  I was so happy to see you for the first time ever.  You know how you were so surprised when we surprised you with Chaz Palmitary?  Yeah.  I just had that same look on my face when I saw you at the door, but you have no idea.  Oh, thank God.  Listen to this.  Oh, God.  Bonnie's not here, right?  No.  All right, good.  Listen to this.  It's Baby Diaper Mustache Day on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Have you ever looked at your baby's diaper and thought, hmm, that belongs on a man's 
[03:50:00]  face?  Do you have a stinky baby?  Do you want to see Opie wear a baby shit mustache?  Hurry, because you have less than two hours to get you and your stinky baby to the Opie and  Anthony Show studios.  That's right.  Show up here with your little rat and Opie will personally apply a heaping helping of  your baby's green shit to his upper lip.  This promotion ends at exactly 11 a.m., so if you and your shitsteak and baby show up  at 11.01, you can go the fuck home. 
[03:50:30]  Baby must be yours.  Shit must be baby's.  Baby must shit in presence of Opie.  Diaper must be clean prior to baby shitting.  This offer is null and void at the end of today's live broadcast.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm breathing now.  I saw your face like you just happened to be in town, maybe at a doctor's office or something.  I'm like, holy shit, it's going down today.  So you're saying you would take baby shit?  Yeah, but here's the beauty, Rich.  I just surprised people out of nowhere.  It turns into baby diaper mustache day.  Today happens to be one of those days, and the odds of it actually happening are slim.  But when we saw your face at the door, I'm like, oh my fucking God. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, because he's somebody that would have been listening.  Because you have stopped by with the baby, too, before.  You know, here's the thing, though.  I mean, there's so many rules to this thing, you know.  The bottom line is you would take baby shit and put it under here.  Yeah.  Get the hell out of here.  You'd make a little mustache with baby shit.  Oh!  Ah!  It's green!  Fuck my audition!  Fuck you!  Fuck it, it's green!  Fuck you, you set me up! 
[03:51:30]  Oh, it's fucking green!  Oh, Bobby's puking!  Bobby's puking!  Get him a pail!  Oh, shit, get him a pail!  Oh, my God, Bobby's puking!  You fuck!  Oh, God damn it!  Oh, fucking Bobby's got the weakest...  Oh, Bobby's got the weakest stomach!  You think he'd be thinner, he throws up so much? 
[03:52:00]  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  If you can do that after each meal, you'd maybe lose a few pounds.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  I'll fucking puke!  I want to see it on his lap!  Fuck all of you!  It's baby shit fucking Friday!  Dude, Opie did...  It's like the plane landed, and everybody started to clap, and then it fucking rolled over and 
[03:52:30]  exploded.  That's exactly it!  This is the best day of radio ever.  Who fucking called you?  Because the beauty of this bit is, I go, Steve, make the promo.  I'm doing baby diaper mustache.  Don't tell anyone.  And then, wait, tax, Sam.  Then I play the thing, and no one has enough time to come over here.  So, someone obviously called you and said, get your ass into New York with some fucking  baby shit.  Well, here's the thing.  No one...  Eric's idea!  No, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, wow. 
[03:53:00]  No one called me.  I had to come in anyhow for some promos, and I always keep a dirty diaper with me just in  case it's an emergency.  You know?  Bobby can't take it.  Bobby can't take it.  I just don't understand why it's green and white.  Yeah, why is it?  Why the multicolored...  What do you feed your baby?  Is it hard for you to puke like that without opening a car door?  And he's on fire, too.  Fuck you, bro.  He is on fire. 
[03:53:30]  That's the one thing that stinks.  He came in on fire.  He's been thinking the whole...  Tip it over.  Tip your baby shit over.  And you're playing it cool, like, what's going on?  You played it perfectly, and then you fucking casually take it out of your fucking jacket  and throw it on the counter.  It's all in.  Oh, God.  He touches it.  Oh, he's touching it, Bobby.  Look at his ass crack hanging out.  Plumber's crack.  He's got his ass crack hanging out as he's puking. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, fuck.  Pull your pants up, you mess.  Oh, what a disaster you are.  Oh, I'm a disaster.  Look at both of you.  Fucking Laszlo and both of you.  What?  Fucking awful.  I don't need gloves.  Fucking stock car racing bodies.  I'm sick of both of you.  You really are, you thin assholes.  Yeah.  Pitted.  So pitted.  Here we go.  Yeah, pitted.  So pitted.  Here we go.  Well, here.  Let's...  Here we go.  Oh. 
[03:54:30]  Here, you can.  You're not using this audio, this newspaper?  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you fucking asshole.  You just set yourself up using this newspaper.  Oh, God.  All right.  All right.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Wow.  What are the odds that I got to set you guys up?  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  He's putting on surgical gloves.  Why are you putting on surgical gloves? 
[03:55:00]  So he can handle...  What's wrong with your baby?  What's wrong with her?  He can handle the diaper.  Nothing.  I want to just fiddle through this myself.  All right.  Let me get over there.  Oh, God.  Fucking E-Rock.  Fuck.  E-Rock sold you out, motherfucker.  Well, you don't have to come here.  We can bring it to you.  All right.  Bring it to me.  What's the hood going to do?  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  No fucking way.  Oh.  No fucking way.  No way.  No way.  Oh, Bobby Puken is so fucking funny. 
[03:55:30]  I don't know why.  Everyone's saying the promo states that it must be a clean diaper and the baby has to shit into  it in their studio.  You said you'd work around that.  You said you'd work around it.  I did.  Fair is fair.  Let's go.  Let's make a nice Yosemite sand.  Holy shit.  I just got my first whip.  Oh, oh.  Dude, disgusting.  Dude, you gotta bring it.  What?  All right. 
[03:56:00]  Bring it over here.  God damn.  Well, let me get it ready.  You better check your baby for fucking eating a dead chicken or something.  I don't know what it fucking ate roadkill.  All right.  Open up the diaper.  Let's see what's in there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Bobby, look.  It looks like.  It looks like he ate.  Oh, God.  Oh, fuck.  It's like dinting more beef stew.  Oh, my God.  Oh, this is so disgusting.  What do you see?  It's so disgusting. 
[03:56:30]  Dead birds.  What is it supposed to look like?  Fucking roses, you asshole and shit?  Rich has been waiting for this day for fucking eight years.  Oh, God.  Rich is puking.  How do you have to kid?  It's your kid.  How do you change it and puke?  Why is this affecting you?  But you have baby shit.  But it's different when I'm.  When it's coming out of its asshole?  Yeah, and when I have clothes on. 
[03:57:00]  Dave from Massachusetts.  Dave from Massachusetts.  To add insult to injury.  To add insult to baby shit injury.  Opie has to live with the fact that he got outsmarted by Voss.  That's true.  That is bad.  And who?  And Iraq.  All right.  Here we go.  What's with his head?  We're just using his afro for a pen holder.  We're having a really weird show.  It's a very sassy day.  Dude, what's in there, really?  What's in there?  Fucking crushed peas.  Some peaches and yams. 
[03:57:30]  I love how diapers have cute little cartoon animals on them.  Because once they're used, then they're just smeared with shit.  Yeah, that looks like cute animals that got shit on.  They put that on there to make you feel guilty for what you're about to do.  You got gloves?  Yeah, right here.  It's wrong with you.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Bobby's puking again. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, my God.  I gotta go.  Why do you need gloves?  You're about to put shit on your face, and you're gonna put plastic gloves on?  Oh, my God.  I am so puking.  And I don't...  It takes a lot for me to puke.  I see.  Sometimes babies...  Fucking fair.  Sometimes babies don't go to the bathroom for a whole day at a time, so this could be,  like, built up.  This is like a couple days.  This is like a couple days of crap.  All right, let me see what you got.  A couple days.  Bring it over. 
[03:58:30]  Bring it over.  Let's go.  You want me to go over there?  Let's go, boss.  It's up to you.  I don't care.  All right, bring it over.  Excuse me.  You're a fucking man among men.  Bring it over?  I give you fucking 100% credit to just stick it to your word.  It's not fair, though.  They set me up.  They know why I do this bit.  It's all about the timing of the thing.  Yeah?  This was never supposed to go down.  No.  Oh, my God.  My chair. 
[03:59:00]  Just staring at shit sitting in a chair on a newspaper.  The quicker you do it, the quicker it's over.  Do you have baby wipes right near you?  Help.  You need baby wipes.  You can't just leave it on your face after that.  Get him some wipes.  Get him a bucket of acid to stick his face in.  I'm hyperventilating.  Do it.  One, two, three.  Where is the diaper?  It's on the chair.  Is it in the chair?  Here we go.  You've got to face forward a little bit.  Here we go.  Hold your breath.  Okay, there you go.  Don't smell.  There you go.  Don't smell. 
[03:59:30]  It's not a big deal.  It's like food, only, you know, in the second stage.  It came out of Voss's kid's asshole.  Food in the second stage is called shit, Rich.  What's the good part?  What's the good part?  The green part.  You're not Bobby Kelly.  He's on fire.  You've got to give it to him.  That's pretty good.  But you know it's coming.  He's going to bomb any second now.  You know it's happening.  How the fuck am I going to do this?  You're going to stick your fingers in there and do it quick.  It's a Sesame Street diaper. 
[04:00:00]  It's a cookie monster.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What's supposed to be?  What do you want on a diaper?  Look at that part.  It's so fucking funny.  Rays on the golf course.  It's unbelievable.  You can take an eight-inch cock in your mouth, but if you look at that, and you're puking 
[04:00:30]  like a maniac.  Eight-inch cock is fucking soft and smells nice.  Let's clean up for you.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Okay, I saved you.  Hurry up.  I've got to get your diaper back.  All right, what are we going for?  I say a big wad on your finger.  I didn't fucking shave today, either.  God damn it.  Oh, man.  It's going to be stuck in there.  I've got to go.  What do you got no addition for?  I'm fucking.  I don't care. 
[04:01:00]  Fucking go.  It's not.  It's a callback.  Cool.  I know you've never heard of one of those.  Oh, shit.  It's definitely not with a girl, is it?  Yes, I knew it would come.  See you, Bob.  You're really just a fucking greedy asshole.  You really are.  You and your fucking extra-large polo shirt.  Just do it, Bob.  Do it.  Man up.  Ready?  Here we go.  Two fingers, each side.  Fucking nice little mustache.  Oh, my God, no.  One, two, three.  Ready?  This is so fucking disgusting. 
[04:01:30]  One, two, three.  This is a new law.  Do it!  A new fucking law.  Do it!  Travis, move your head.  Do it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Travis.  One, two.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is called baby diaper mustache.  Oh, God.  One, two, three.  Do two fingers at a time.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  He's got it on his finger.  He's got some.  He's smearing. 
[04:02:00]  He's got it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I see YouTube sensation right now.  This is going to be a YouTube sensation.  Can you say RobertKelleyLive.com right after you do it?  That is fucking disgusting.  All right.  This is called.  Oh, it stinks.  Once again, this is called baby diaper mustache.  One, two, three. 
[04:02:30]  One, two, three.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  One, two, three, dude.  Obey!  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'm going to get it off. 
[04:03:00]  He fell on the floor.  He fell on the floor.  He did it.  He took two fingers.  Wiped it right under his nose.  Now he can't get the smell out of his head.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's kissed.  He's got the diaper in his hand.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's running off to the bathroom. 
[04:03:30]  Holy shit.  Oh, no.  What a fucking prop act.  I'll see you guys later.  Take it easy, Bobby.  Thanks, man.  Oh, my God.  He's got tears.  I fucking love you.  I fucking love you.  I really didn't think he'd do that.  I fucking love Laz.  I'll see you later.  I did not think he would do that.  This is the best show I've ever fucking done, ever.  I'll see you guys.  I'm going to puke.  Because Opie's rarely on the receiving end of any of that stuff.  Literally, that shit.  And to see him actually, he took two fingers full on his index finger and smeared it right 
[04:04:00]  under his nose.  And the worst part is he hesitated.  He held his fingers right under his nose for a minute.  Yeah.  And then kept going back and forth with him.  And then after he finished throwing up, he tried to wipe it off.  And then he just had green shit spread across his mouth.  And it went on his lip.  Now it was so close to his mouth.  It was a big wide.  It wasn't just like.  Dude, that shit is green.  That baby shit was green. 
[04:04:30]  Alien fucking green.  You guys called me one day and said you.  Oh, what a picture.  That's it.  E-Rock's showing me a still picture.  Opie's horrified and just got baby shit smeared all under his nose.  I am so disgusted.  A new low.  A brand new low on the Opie and Anthony show.  I didn't think it could be done.  When he picked up that diaper and ran around.  I'm sure it was going to go in E-Rock's face.  Oh, yeah.  It should have.  Oh.  It's still in the garbage can. 
[04:05:00]  Oh.  You can still put it in E-Rock's face.  You look winded.  Dude.  Voss.  Voss, it's in the garbage pail if you want to put it with the rest of your act in a notebook  or something.  Dude.  Let me tell you something.  Did you water down my joke from earlier?  Oh, I did?  Fuck.  Per usual, I wasn't listening to you.  Wow.  Voss comes through.  Let me tell you something.  All right.  Yeah.  Opie, please.  Describe it for the people. 
[04:05:30]  What's it like to smear baby shit under your nose for really nothing?  Oh, my God.  Like, people would do that for a $10,000 bet, maybe.  Right, or ratings.  Like, you string it out over a few days over at K-Rock.  Dude, 10 grand.  You smear baby shit under your nose.  Fuck you.  And you did it for the show.  Dude.  Oh, my God.  It's still.  Get me a fucking razor immediately.  You need something.  No, dude.  I can't get it out of my mustache.  Yeah?  I have never been.  You want the big baby shit? 
[04:06:00]  No.  I need a razor.  I'm not even fucking kidding.  It's got four blades.  Don't kill yourself over it.  Dude.  I've never been more grossed out and sicker in my life.  Wow.  I just fucking puked so much.  Go look at the toilet in the bathroom.  And I'm telling you, I'm one of these guys that takes a lot for me to puke.  There's a FedEx package here.  This was fast.  It's a diamond ring from Lindsay.  Thank God she's at yoga today. 
[04:06:30]  Oh, you don't want to listen to Replay.  It was just a regular show today.  Yeah.  Oh, dude.  I fucking don't feel right.  It's called hepatitis.  Yeah, right?  Has that kid been inoculated?  You went from like the top radio host in the country to an intern.  Yeah.  Yeah, you did.  You fucking...  Man, you know what?  I'm a man of my word, though.  You can't now say he's not.  You guys outsmarted me, which is not easy, you fuckers.  Because I swear to God, I'll take you inside the thing completely.  I was like, there's no fucking way anyone will ever get to the studio in time. 
[04:07:00]  So every once in a while, we'll throw this on the air like as a goof.  Baby diaper mustache.  Knowing there's no fucking way.  But these motherfuckers were in cahoots and outsmarted me.  That doesn't happen.  It all just came together.  It certainly did.  And you played it perfectly.  Did you come in and get his first appearance?  I got it from the point when he was like, you realized that Bonnie wasn't here. 
[04:07:30]  And then, you know, you guys were just talking.  And then he pulled the diaper out.  And you were like, oh, my God.  You had no clue I had a diaper on me?  No.  I thought it was off the hook.  Because when I saw your face, I'm like, oh, shit, they're in town for a doctor's visit.  You've done it before.  And then when you came in, you acted perfectly.  Like, what are you talking about?  And then when I set up the bid, like, oh, thank God I'm off the hook.  And you go, well, bam.  And you showed the diaper.  Can you cut where he just said you acted perfectly?  Can we get that anywhere on TV or something? 
[04:08:00]  You acted.  The keyword would be acted perfectly.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know, tell Chaz about that.  Next time we talked to Palomari or whatever his name is.  Where did Bobby go?  Yeah, he had to go to a little audition callback or something.  But there's just something about Bobby vomiting that is the funniest fucking thing.  I will always laugh my ass off when Bob Kelly pukes.  It's the sound.  It's what he's puking at.  I used to think it was a bid, too, until you see it live. 
[04:08:30]  No, no.  You can actually see him convulsing physically.  His whole head turns beet red.  You see how his audience feels?  Can we take a break?  I need to.  Yeah.  We'll take a break.  You probably should scrub under there with maybe lemons or something.  Dude, I'm getting sick all over again because it's in my mustache.  Not that I have a mustache.  I didn't see it in the last three days.  It's like a little stubble.  It's even worse because it's easier to get caught in stubble than a mustache.  You just wipe it out of a mustache.  It's going to be great in the Belcro.  In a few days when he has chicken pox. 
[04:09:00]  All the baby diseases.  You're going to have baby diseases.  The mumps.  He'll have all the baby diseases.  Rubella.  You have rubella.  You're going to have a little balloon following you.  Wow, that was an old one.  Jesus Christ.  Why don't you just go back to polio, you fucking fossil?  Like when I can make old jokes.  Two minutes ago, I was a king.  Yeah, that's how this place works.  One minute you're a king, the next you got baby shit under your nose. 
[04:09:30]  I don't even know what you guys said.  I am so fucking out of it right now.  Well, I guess you should be.  Because I got all hyped out, the adrenaline and everything.  You know, if you make it sound.  I ate, then puked in the bathroom.  You make it sound too much like you got a buzz off of it.  All the kids.  All the kids are going to be rubbing baby shit under their nose.  By the way, Blotto from Blotto 98, Detroit.  Patrice equals bluffing puss wad.  Opie equals man of his word.  What a difference a week makes.  Yeah, because Patrice was supposed to take a fucking strap-on up the butt last week.  Well, you know, I'm not saying baby shit under your nose is a treat by any stretch of the imagination. 
[04:10:00]  But Patrice getting fucked in the ass with a dildo and him backing out of that might.  I could see a little justification, man.  See, you got to just trick Patrice and tell him it's a cattle prod.  Dude, what do I wipe under my nose?  I really don't know what gets the smell of baby shit out of a man's mustache stubble.  You should ask a few pedophiles.  They can help you out.  Adult shit. 
[04:10:30]  Cover it up.  Doesn't Bob Kelly owe him $100 for that diaper?  Yeah, Bob owes you $100.  He said if something comes in, $100 guaranteed.  Oh, that's right.  $100 cash, buddy.  Fuck him.  Oh, fuck.  Dude, I need something for my nose.  I'm begging.  I'm begging.  I'm begging.  I would think probably lemon.  What do we got?  I'm serious.  See, you should have kept some ketchup.  Sam in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Radio gold. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that.  I never.  I really didn't think you were going to do it.  I would say radio green.  Dude, I actually.  When I looked at the diaper the first time.  And then what really got me was when I put the gloves on.  And then I like smear like you would baby.  I can't even talk.  Like finger paint.  And it was now a nice glove on each index finger.  Yeah.  I started getting lightheaded.  I started to go to a safe place.  Yeah, maybe do we have a cleaning product? 
[04:11:30]  Maybe like a dab, a little Lysol.  No joke.  I got to go do something.  Yeah.  Do whatever you got to do.  Put that in a paper towel and dab it in your whiskers.  Back to the Laszlo and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Let me.  Laszlo, I've had something to confess for quite a while.  Now, we'll take a break while Opie fucking tries to get baby shit out from under his nose.  I can't believe you did that.  Leave some breadcrumbs back to your dignity.  We'll be right back.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is called Baby Diaper Mustache.  Baby Diaper Mustache.  How the fuck am I going to do this? 
[04:12:00]  You're going to stick your fingers in there and do it quick.  It's not a big deal.  It's like food only, you know, in the second stage.  Food in the second stage is called shit, Rich.  Let's do it.  Man up.  Wow.  Look at that part.  This is a new wall.  Do it.  A new fucking wall.  Let me do it.  Oh, my God, no.  Oh, God.  Open.  Open.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God, no.  Oh, no. 
[04:12:30]  That is fucking disgusting.  Hot wax on the nipples.  Oh, fuck.  A crying, drunk, homeless man.  And creepy gay kid Sam singing.  Happy birthday to you.  Just some of the cringe moments you'll hear on Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2008.  It's the Worst of Opie and Anthony's 2008. 
[04:13:00]  Cringiest moments.  E-Rock, primetime Sam Roberts joining you today.  Yeah.  While the guys are on vacation.  Technically, we're on vacation, too.  But we're never on vacation to E-Rock.  There's something that people don't realize.  We're so dedicated.  There's E-Rock and Sam, and those two don't stop working.  No.  It's New Year's Day, and we're still chilling in the studio with you people listening to  some of our favorite bits.  The bits that have made us cringe the most in 2008.  What's the company made us coming in?  Well, you know, we're underlings right now.  Yes.  One day, E-Rock.  Are we getting paid for this?  No.  Of course not.  No.  What do we have here?  Ah, wait a minute. 
[04:13:30]  Of course I know what we have here.  This is something that will make my partner here a little uneasy.  This, I just see the list here.  This is getting on the cringiest moments because it makes me cringe.  Yes.  It's when Seth Green came into studio.  And the way this worked out is you're living a real-life entourage scenario here.  Mm-hmm.  And it involves Seth Green, who is also on Entourage.  Right.  But you're doing the whole E versus Seth Green battling back and forth over a girl.  Well, the thing is, my girlfriend had said she wanted to meet Seth Green. 
[04:14:00]  And she'd never come into studio to meet anybody.  She's just not the type.  Yeah.  But I said, you know, come in, meet Seth Green, get a DVD sign, take a little picture and everything.  Well, the powers that be thought it necessary to bring her in studio.  Your girlfriend's cute.  Well, thank you.  Yeah.  I guess.  That's why they brought her in.  It wasn't because of you.  No, it wasn't.  They think she's hot.  She, they do.  Everybody oogles her with her eyes.  And they call her and text her.  Yes.  I just pay way too much attention to her.  Yes.  But hey, it means they're nice to me when she's around. 
[04:14:30]  It's nice to have the host of two major radio shows flirting with your girlfriend.  In a way.  I see it as a career plus.  All right.  Well, I mean, yeah, it's not hurting my career.  Nope.  Although, there's certainly no breaking up with her.  No.  That would be detrimental to my career.  Yes, because then nobody would focus any attention on you at all.  No, why wouldn't they?  But she focused her own attention on Seth Green.  And this is it.  It made me cringe.  You'll probably just laugh at me.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I have pictures of your chick here I'll just look at while we're listening to that bit.  Then you pick it up. 
[04:15:00]  Opie and Anthony, 2008 cringiest moments.  Sam and E. Rock will be right back.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments.  Yeah.  I'll look back at some of the most uncomfortable yet hilarious portions of the show.  Three, two, Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments.  Happy New Year.  Hey, we got to put someone on the spot. 
[04:15:30]  Yes, Jess, you're coming in and asking a question.  This is Sam's girlfriend.  She never comes to work with Sam ever, ever, ever.  But today she did because she's a huge fan of Seth Green.  I signed a DVD for him.  Why don't you sit down over there?  Oh, okay.  Jess, sit over there.  You're a star.  Don't worry.  You don't have to hover over her.  She'll be fine without you for a second.  Now, you've never been in studio with us before?  Never.  First time for everything?  Yep.  I've been on the phone but never in studio.  Right.  How long have you and Sam been together?  Actually, it's three years tomorrow. 
[04:16:00]  Oh, congratulations.  Way to hold on.  Wow.  Thank you.  They might be getting engaged.  Well, I heard that he's looking at rings, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's always the way you want to hear it, too.  On the radio.  Right.  So you're a huge Seth Green fan?  Yeah, I am.  I've been a fan since forever.  Oh, thanks.  Can't Hardly Wait is my favorite movie.  Oh, we just did a commentary for that because it's like 10 years now.  For real?  Mm-hmm.  Sam, for our anniversary.  I could take that.  Merry Christmas.  Well, I've got to be stupid.  Can't Hardly Wait, what was that about? 
[04:16:30]  It was kind of the resurgence of teen comedy movies.  There was a point in time where they weren't making any movies like this, and this was a  throwback to John Husey-style movies.  Nice.  Yeah, it's the best.  I've got to have sex tonight.  It sounds like you're in luck, Sam.  So do you have a question for Seth Green?  Well, I actually wanted to know, where were you born?  In Philadelphia.  Oh, really?  But you were in the media and everything since day one.  How did that happen?  Well, not technically day one.  I've actually been pretty fortunate to avoid the media for the most part. 
[04:17:00]  I find that tabloid media doesn't really care about comedians.  You look at, like, Sasha Cohen or Ben Stiller or any of those guys, they don't really care.  And since I don't have sex with anybody famous visibly, no one bothers me.  It's great.  I mean, that works, definitely.  But as far as movies, how old were you when you got started?  I did my first acting job, like, professional acting job when I was seven.  And I did my first feature when I was eight.  Were you independently motivated or was it something other?  Yeah, no, I just, I was lucky enough to have direction when I was very young. 
[04:17:30]  Oh, my God, I'm sitting back.  I'm just going to chase that.  I'm just going to sit back and not work.  I like this.  Not the funniest of interviews.  No, no, no.  My favorite part so far is the way Jess said, so you were in the media spotlight since day one.  And Seth said, no, I really haven't been much.  And she went, okay, good.  And then just continued with that.  Day one.  She already has follow-up questions and everything.  I know.  We usually are like, hum-a-da, hum-a-da, hum-a-da.  Yeah, I just wanted to point out.  It's almost like this is what prep sounds like.  I know.  Like, I don't know what prep sounds like.  Us, us.  I'm surprised Jess to come in here and, like, talk to one of her favorite celebrities and 
[04:18:00]  she can speak like a human being.  I know.  But any time any wrestler comes in here and you're like, Sam, ask him questions, I just collapse.  Look at Sam's first self-deprecating piece of humor right there.  Only because it was in defense of his girl.  Yeah.  You are whipped.  What are you talking about?  What do you think of the hair?  I'm so ready for him to shave it.  It's got to go.  I was hoping that I could maybe shave it.  Really?  Yep.  I'm thinking about it. 
[04:18:30]  Sam, all I can tell you is that it is a valuable thing to shave your head at least once in your  life.  I recommend several times myself.  So this hair is the mane of a champion from Afro Wars.  Then I recommend you cut it into a glorious mohawk.  Thank you.  That would actually be very cool.  Afro Wars is over.  You got a robot chicken question for him?  No, not that I can think of.  I mean, I'm impressed with how dynamic his career has been that, you know, he produces  as well as acts.  And I just want to say thank you.  Thank you.  Well, I thank you.  Thank you for letting me come in. 
[04:19:00]  She's so gracious.  She's falling apart.  Yes.  Now she's falling apart.  Yeah, we got to just let her sit there for two more minutes.  It's going to get ugly.  I want to see her completely degenerate into a puddle.  Yeah.  I'm going to have a smile red now.  You're getting a little.  You're going to start doing the Chris Farley interview really soon.  That was awesome.  Oh, my gosh.  When you were wearing that blue shirt and you had the headset on, that was so cool.  There's nothing worse than when it's going really well and all of a sudden you just run 
[04:19:30]  out of steam.  Oh, that's the worst.  Yeah.  Are you implying that's what happened?  Well, that's what happened to us.  That's why we invited Jess in.  It's happened to me every time I've talked to somebody who I admire.  I start off gangbusters.  Who's on that list?  Anybody in Black Sabbath, Ozzy, a lot of actors.  There is one question.  He's actually wearing a Black Sabbath shirt.  It's all about Ozzy.  He's the biggest Ozzy Black Sabbath fan and he did an interview.  Are the Osbournes going to come through here for the new show?  Hopefully, yeah.  We just had her on the phone.  I think, oh, you mean for the Variety show? 
[04:20:00]  Yeah.  I'd love to have it.  The Variety show, yeah.  I'd pay my own airfare to perform on that.  There's an interview, though, that Jimmy did with Black Sabbath.  And who were you talking to about the dress?  It was Zach.  That was Zach.  Zach Weill.  All right.  It was Zach Weill.  Do we have that clip?  He...  Why would he rock...  Oh, sorry.  He asks a question that is just a rambling, babbling mess of a question, and we find it very  funny.  We're going to find that.  It's very endearing. 
[04:20:30]  It's nice because it's Jimmy being honestly taken sitting there in front of one of his childhood  heroes.  No, Zach wasn't...  Zach I like a lot.  Sabbath, I was so blown away because I got to interview them one-on-one.  I was so horrified that I was actually good.  It was almost like I was beyond being terrified.  You were much better than I was.  Well, sometimes you just shock yourself into an abject reality.  I've met people that I'm so impressed by, and the burden's on me to act normal, so you  actually have some kind of valuable interaction with them.  It is, but sometimes in that moment, you're so freaked out that you wind up being crazy 
[04:21:00]  normal.  Who blew you away?  Who did you want to meet that you met that was like, oh?  I bumped into Denzel Washington by accident.  We were both at Show West in Vegas coming out of interview boots, and I literally bumped  right into them and had a moment where I was like, oh, hey, Seth, nice to meet you.  You shook his hand.  I was like, your movie looks really good.  I'm excited to see it, that kind of thing.  How do you deal with this kind of press?  It seems like a weird sensation, this, that, and the other thing, and barely had three  lines into it, and then Burt Reynolds, who was in the movie that I had done, grabbed 
[04:21:30]  and goes, Denzel, and just pushes him into a corner and just corners him and starts  having a conversation with him, and I just totally let that happen.  And the thing about Burt, no one denies him.  Burt pushes you into a corner to have a conversation.  You are in that corner having a conversation.  I was like, did Denzel know you, right?  He knew you were.  He didn't give any indication.  Oh, no.  Come on.  But did he treat you like a fanboy, or did he like to treat you like...  No, he was nice.  He's a classy gentleman.  He's got to know who you are.  I don't know that. 
[04:22:00]  I never put it past anybody.  He's in the piss.  You should have mentioned X.  You should have said you certainly should have gotten the best actor for X.  Why'd they give that to Pacino?  It would have won him right over.  It would have hugged you for that.  Sounds like pandering.  No, it's true.  We got the Jimmy thing asking about the dress.  Let's hear it.  We did something in a dress.  I don't...  It was fucking...  It was in Philadelphia.  Oh, God.  Okay.  Perhaps that was...  Perhaps that was played on the other side of reality.  Let's go to the blue clip.  Play that some other time.  That's the F word.  Make sure that we can play this. 
[04:22:30]  That's funny.  I love when we do that.  It's so funny because obviously we do a show from 9 to 11 on XM, satellite radio, exclusively.  Where you don't have to beat it down.  Yeah, and there's no...  You know, you can say whatever you want.  So whenever something comes to mind, we forget whether it was done here or over there.  And sometimes, like cold, just like that, we pop it in a play and it's just like, okay.  Yeah, I forgot about that little thing called the FCC.  We can always play the banana clip that happened last week with Gene Simmons where you offered  him your banana. 
[04:23:00]  No, man, we had Gene Simmons on the show and that was an adventure.  Have you guys had him in here?  Yeah, yeah.  He's an ass.  He's just an ass.  I'll tell you what, he brought his son with him, his son Nick, who is hilariously cool.  That kid came in and he came to do a couple bits on the show too.  The kid's a really good actor, first of all.  Yeah.  Sharp as hell, took direction.  But Gene, because I've met him a couple times before and he had no recollection of any of  those times, but when his kid came in, his kid was just busting his balls relentlessly. 
[04:23:30]  And to see a father-son dynamic between Gene Simmons and his son is hilarious.  That's awesome.  Yeah, he was busting Gene's balls?  Like crazy.  Because Gene's in the booth and every single time he does something, Nick would just click  over and he's like, that was great, Dad.  Gene was hungry and wanted Jimmy's banana.  It's really quick.  How was it?  I got to be, because the roasting Gene was, you know, you used to think.  Can I take a bite?  Sure, you can have the whole thing.  I'll actually share it with you if you want. 
[04:24:00]  You know the banana.  He saw a moment there where he could share a piece of fruit with Gene Simmons.  How do you not?  Who would want to, though?  Yeah, why?  You go, I'll share it with you if you want.  You know what it is?  It's the fact that he offered him the whole banana first and then had this quick second  thought like, no, wait, I could share it with him.  And that would be a moment for me.  And then I'll say that I shared it with him.  Maybe both our mouths touch it at the same time.  Yeah.  Right.  I'm just putting that out there.  Do a little double-dung banana action while you eat it? 
[04:24:30]  What are you doing?  I've done nothing but humiliate myself in front of KISS members.  I've just humiliated myself in front of them.  Roland has a question for Seth, I hear.  Roland?  Roland.  Are you setting him up, you rock?  And Jess, you've got to have one final question for Seth Green.  Maybe a little family guy question or something.  We haven't even talked about KISS here.  Did you get a picture at least?  No.  I'd love a picture.  We better get it quick.  I have got to go.  Here's Roland.  Roland?  Yeah.  Hello.  Hey, Roland.  Hello.  Do you have a question for Seth Green? 
[04:25:00]  I don't think so.  No, you do.  You told me it.  Go ahead.  Oh, no.  I just saw it.  No, I will not make out with you, Roland.  Aw.  The new Star Wars, the Robot Chicken DVD, the commentary.  Yes, way to bring it back to subject.  Thank you.  The special features, which are really cool, two hours of extra.  He talks about he got Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise together, first time in 15 years.  That's on the first season of Robot Chicken, yeah, in the special features.  I did a movie with Burt Reynolds and befriended him and fell desperately in love with him, 
[04:25:30]  as most people do when they're in his presence, and got invited to dinner at his house that  Dom had cooked.  That's a call you like to get.  He's like, hey, Seth, it's Burt.  I just wanted to let you know Dom's cooking tonight.  It'd be great if you came by.  And I was like, I will be there, dude.  I'm totally coming.  And so I sweet-talked him into coming and doing the show, and they did like a Cannonball  run bit in the first season, which is on our DVD.  What's your favorite Burt Reynolds moment on film?  In his films or in our films?  Yeah, in his films.  Oh, man. 
[04:26:00]  Anytime he smiles on camera, it's just glorious.  Sorry, Seth.  Roland's very ticklish.  What happened over there?  He's very ticklish.  Roland being tickled.  He laughs like a little boy.  It's so sweet, though.  Watch, watch, watch.  He's not faking that.  It's the most bizarre.  You might want to put that on Robot Chicken, because it's just bizarre, man.  He just loses it.  You all right?  Do you realize you just did what everyone does to us? 
[04:26:30]  Blah, blah.  Don't put this on your show.  He'll be putting us in Robot Chicken.  Yeah, before you know it, he'll be talking about don't tell him anything.  He'll go on his radio show.  It's all about the boys on the radio.  Don't you love when people do that?  It's my favorite.  Yeah, don't talk in front of him.  It'll end up on his show.  People pitch me sketches all the time.  Really?  Yeah, and people don't understand.  But it's very interesting, because you get to see exactly what people think the show is 
[04:27:00]  versus what it actually is.  It's like, here's the scene.  Batman is really giving it to Strawberry Shortcake.  Okay?  And she's like, oh, my berries, my berries.  And he says, I am the knight.  Ha, ha.  And you're just like, A, there is no legal defensible parody in that joke whatsoever.  Not to mention the fact that it is unbelievably unfunny.  And this is, I have to shatter people's dreams all the time by telling them they're a sketch.  How do you let them off the hook?  I usually explain exactly how we write the show and how different our process is from 
[04:27:30]  what people think it is.  And the jokes that people come up with, how arbitrary the combinations of elements are  and just how diligently we work to make things actually make sense so that we don't get sued.  Ah, that's the key.  Yeah.  Jess, anything else?  Family Guy?  I knew you were going to ask me.  Aside from Robot Chicken, do you have any movies or anything coming up that, because I want to see  I actually made two movies this year, one of which won't be out until next year, one that's  coming out in October. 
[04:28:00]  I think this movie called Sex Drive with Clark Duke and James Marsden, where I play an Amish  kid.  And next year, April, I think they're putting it out, it's a movie I did with John Travolta  and Rob Williams called Old Dogs.  Very cool.  A big old family comedy for you and your kids.  You're back.  That sounds very good.  Well, I'll be there.  I hope so.  Why does it take so long for the movies to come out?  Well, this actually, you know, this had to do with the writer's strike and the way that  Disney organized the release slate, kind of in anticipation of a work stoppage.  They pushed a couple of movies, and that way they had at least a staggered slate in case 
[04:28:30]  they couldn't make any other films.  Sure.  And then we reshot the whole ending, so.  Oh.  That'll do it.  We're going to end with this.  Sorry, Jimmy.  What is it?  Jimmy asking Zach Wilde about the dress.  Oh, but they bleeped the F-bomb.  Yeah.  It's just stupid.  I like the idea of a fan asking questions like that who's not used to it, because it's  like a thrill.  It's like you take focus of meeting people.  Well, let's really get into this.  Would you blow off Sam for Seth Green?  Absolutely.  Like, it would be real easy, right?  Absolutely.  It wouldn't even be a problem. 
[04:29:00]  I said to Sam.  That's awkward, because I'm not looking for a relationship.  You wouldn't even think twice, right?  Not at all.  Sam would be so gone.  Oh, Sam.  Sam, don't take that shit.  He'd just become roommates at that point.  I mean, that stuff.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  I mean, we would...  You would just leave your stuff in the apartment, right?  Well, we'd live together, I guess.  Yeah, but you would just...  You'd be like, I don't need that anymore.  Yeah.  Did you have a crush on Seth at any point?  You're very handsome, dude.  I still do have a crush on Seth.  I love him.  You guys are so silly.  And thank you.  You watch Buffy a lot?  Oh, yeah. 
[04:29:30]  Me and my dad, we watch Buffy all the time.  Wow.  All right.  Sam's a little red-cheeked.  He's a little embarrassed.  Yeah.  But Sam would understand, right?  Dude, you can't hold a camera.  You would have to understand that one.  You're holding a camera for this dumb show.  Yeah.  And he's Seth.  What are you going to do?  But who's the girl on your list?  I mean, who's the girl that would walk you around?  Oh, John Cena.  He has a big crush on who?  Kristen Bell.  Oh, she's great, my buddy.  You had her in, the little blonde girl.  Oh, really?  She's on the hero. 
[04:30:00]  That and Beyonce.  She's making that face for me.  All right.  She's all right.  Beyonce?  Beyonce.  Kristen Bell is like nerd delight, though.  For a second, I thought you said Kristen Bell.  Kristen Bell.  No, that's my crush.  Right.  So that doesn't offend you at all a little bit to hurt your feelings?  No, Sam, you've got to understand that.  I mean, I understand it'd be better.  If he wasn't, like, for instance, in the room.  It's awkward.  It's awkward because he's in the room now.  See, because when girls usually, you know, 99.9% of the American public, if the guy asked  the girl that question or vice versa, they give an answer. 
[04:30:30]  They're never going to see the person.  Well, what's the dumb conversation?  It's always something.  It's always, all right, what's your freebie or your gimme?  My husband gave me one.  Well, mine is Brad Pitt.  I've got to tell you, knowing that she's never going to get near him.  But now, I mean.  I always like to pick somebody reasonably attentive.  You judge somebody kindly.  That's the bit.  Well, I'm picking the secretary I work with.  You know who's on my list?  Yeah.  The new intern.  Right.  Yeah, you can have Brad Pitt all you want. 
[04:31:00]  My one and only is the intern that started working with him.  I picked the Channel 11 traffic girl.  I made it easy.  Crazy, yo.  Wait, that's not the real time, is it?  Yeah, I know.  Oh, boy.  You got to go?  Well, I'm supposed to go meet somebody for another interview.  For a drink.  Yeah, drink it.  Where are you going next?  Actually, it's only a couple blocks away, but I've got to get to AP.  To an AP interview.  I almost said associate at press to explain what AP is.  Shut up.  I suck. 
[04:31:30]  By the way, Sam, your girlfriend wants to sleep with Seth.  Yeah.  So it's the haps.  Yeah, and he's in the room.  It's usually okay.  Listen, if you guys are free after 11 and you still got that camera.  Uh-huh.  Oh!  Just a cuckold with a camera.  No, no, we'll set it up on a tripod, Sam.  We're getting the action.  Don't worry.  Oh, damn.  I guess the haps would be, in hindsight, maybe this should have been one of those interviews  that I told Jess about, like, this afternoon. 
[04:32:00]  Right.  And she'd have gone, oh, you should have told me.  I'll take you to the website to watch the video.  Jim, I don't think we have time to play the show.  No, I know.  Why do you think I kept talking?  You're very lucky.  Will you guys burn it to MP3 for me?  I'll put it in my app.  Yes, please.  Here it is.  You might want it for your show.  Yeah.  I'll put it on the program.  Don't put me in the cartoon.  N-O-R-T.  All right, Lucy McGillicuddy.  What the hell is...  I really do. 
[04:32:30]  All right, we've got to thank Seth Green.  That was the character I was killing.  It was.  It really was.  Hey, this is Seth Green.  If you can stop masturbating and put down that bong for just a second, you'll realize that  you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Enjoy.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments.  What was the last movie you saw?  See any good movies lately?  Lately?  I don't know.  What was the last movie you saw?  Mother Jugs and Speed.  Say it again.  That was quite all right. 
[04:33:00]  Yeah.  What was the last movie you saw, Tom?  I saw...  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let me get this in my head.  I've taken up time.  I know that.  It's all right.  Let me get this in my head on the movie.  Ask me what movie I like the most.  Tippi, what's the movie you like the most?  Okay. 
[04:33:30]  I'll give you the actress's name.  And it broke my heart.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  He's rubbing his chest.  Meryl Streep.  Meryl Streep.  What's she playing?  A lot of movies, Tom.  You got to give us a little more.  Yeah, a lot of them.  Iron Weed.  Kramer.  Meryl Streep.  Kramer versus Kramer.  Oh, no.  That was an old one.  All right.  Which one?  It was the one with the daughter. 
[04:34:00]  What was...  No, the one where she was in the Nazi, German camp.  The Nazis had her.  They're German.  I'm German.  I'm embarrassed about how Germans do this stuff.  And shame on me.  But I didn't do it.  You'll be embarrassed about being German.  Yeah.  Well, my name is Schultz.  And so...  Schultz?  No.  With Meryl Streep.  She was in the Nazi concentration camp. 
[04:34:30]  Oh, I know it.  And it was...  Oh, my God.  Help me.  The Deer Hunter.  Oh, that was another one.  What movie is he talking about?  I'm going to work on...  Meryl Streep.  Come on.  You know who she is?  Sophie's Choice.  Sophie's Choice.  No.  What the movie was about?  What was it about?  She had two children. 
[04:35:00]  Two children.  And the Nazis took her and they said,  You can't go with both of them.  You know who she gave up?  Oh.  Her girl.  The daughter.  The kid, the boy.  The boy.  That was Sophie's Choice.  How do you have to be a mom and have to do that?  Why do you all give up? 
[04:35:30]  And Nazi Germany, that's how they were.  I have one kid.  How emotional he's getting.  Terrible, terrible thing.  What happened to the other kid?  I don't know.  But what I know is that Sophie Meryl Streep gave up her daughter to save her son.  Was she Jewish?  Is that it? 
[04:36:00]  So, I don't know if she's Jewish or not.  She's German.  And, and, and, and, and, and, no.  But that's what happened.  So you don't like the Nazis, right?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, really?  I love the Nazis.  They're great.  He's killing you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I really like them guys.  Right.  I can't wait to hang out with them.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[04:36:30]  Oh, Jesus, Tom.  Watch the, uh, watch the words.  Now, Tom, she had to give up her kid, which is a big, but didn't you, in a way, do the  same thing?  Not for the Nazis, but didn't you do the same thing when you kind of came to New York and  you're drinking and you kind of gave up your kid?  Tippy's choice.  Yeah, Tippy's choice.  Tippy's choice.  You gave up your kid because you didn't want him to know that you were a little flaky,  right?  Yeah.  Tom, you told us earlier.  You had to give up a kid.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I made sure my kid was with his mother. 
[04:37:00]  Don't you wonder how he's doing in school or what is, like, sports he plays?  My grandmother, I did the best I could.  We were going through a divorce.  What do you do?  You go through a divorce, you come talk to me when you go through a divorce, and we'll  discuss what's going on.  But don't you call him?  What are you going to do?  Give him a call.  So I give a kid, uh, the mother, and I pay child support.  Oh, you did?  Of course. 
[04:37:30]  What do you think I'm not?  I was just asking, Tippy.  Right?  I was just asking, you did?  I got money.  I don't need nobody's money.  You do?  Come out here and just play.  I, I, I, I, I, I got my own.  You don't know who I know.  Oh, really?  So you got your own deal set up where you make money and stuff?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  We have a guy named, uh, John Lehman.  Ooh.  The John Lehman? 
[04:38:00]  Pfft.  No.  I didn't know him.  Herbert Lehman?  Who's he?  I don't know.  You just mentioned your names.  Herbert, Herbert Lehman is John's father.  Uh-huh.  I don't know who these people are, and you can't really.  The fucking millionaires!  I'm already listening.  You don't know Lehman Brothers?  Of course you don't know Lehman Brothers.  But you don't have to curse us out.  So you have, you have some investments, I guess.  You're that right I do.  Yeah. 
[04:38:30]  Child support.  They open the envelope, it's a hubcap and some grass.  Hey, Tom, sing us out of here.  We got to go.  That's it for us today.  Give us a little song as we leave everybody today.  Maybe something a little emotional.  We went a little emotional there for a few minutes.  All right.  Give us something a little emotional.  Let me hear a song.  No, just something in your head.  Something emotional.  Come on.  Feel it.  Something slow and nice and tugs at the heartstrings.  All right.  Take us out.  I'm working on it right now.  Take us out.  Tippi Tom's going to sing us out with an emotional song. 
[04:39:00]  Say, hold on, hold on, hold on.  There's so many of them.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Wishing you were here, my baby.  Wishing you were here by me.  Yes, I know.  Yes, I know.  Wishing you were here.  Don't you know I love you so?  Don't you know I care. 
[04:39:30]  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Don't you know I care.  That's it.  All the lyrics is it.  That's it.  But I got all the wounds.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you.  That was very touching.  That's a pretty song.  That was good.  Tippi Tom, everybody.  I know who sang.  Millie Boy.  That was good. 
[04:40:00]  I heard that was good.  I heard that was good.  Yes, geez.  I heard that was good.  That was good.  I'll immerse it in your middle to close the breaking.  Show busca busca nightino news.  That was so pretty.  That was the best one with your body.  That was good at all.  I want to get busy.  Hey.  Hey. 
[04:40:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Tom.  Tom.  What, sir?  All right.  We want to show you a clip.  Jimmy suggested that we get you a couple clips that you might like today.  Can you see the big screen right there?  Up top?  Yeah.  Sam, point to the screen. 
[04:41:00]  He should be.  Okay.  It's on all screens.  All right.  Look at the screen.  Tell us what's going on.  First of all, that chick I don't like.  But earlier you said you liked her.  Well, she's okay.  Oh, God.  The studio's filling up.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, we got Nazis here.  Oh, why are you showing all those Nazi shit?  About the Germans?  Nazis.  No, that's, um, that's, this is your favorite movie.  No. 
[04:41:30]  Sophie's Choice.  So.  Look.  Well, no, Sophie's Choice is very different.  No, look.  See?  It's Meryl Streep.  It's the daughter.  You're right.  Here it is.  Here's your movie.  You're right.  Look at that fine gentleman.  All right, listen to the movie.  No, he's a man.  Tom, listen to the movie.  Here we go.  You're a Polar.  You. 
[04:42:00]  You're also one of these drecking communists.  We're playing the scene that made him cry earlier on the show, where Meryl Streep has  to give up one of her kids in my house.  Yeah.  We're watching the version dubbed in German. 
[04:42:30]  This is not the English version.  No.  He's counting.  Come and see here.  That Nazi son of a bitch.  Look, I'm German.  And I don't like what they did.  What did they do, Tom?  Because no one speaks fucking German here.  They killed people.  Might as well stop and no one can understand it.  I speak Spanish and German.  Steve from Bayshore. 
[04:43:00]  I love Germany.  I love America.  Right.  This is the end of the movie.  Like, some of it's in English, some of it's in German, and this part happens to be in  German.  There's no subtitles on this particular clip.  Uh-huh.  I guess you're supposed to know what's going on kind of a thing.  And Danny's not happy now.  Exactly.  The Germans were wrong.  The Germans were wrong.  But they did. 
[04:43:30]  What'd they do?  Tommy, this is your favorite movie.  Explain what's going on, because we don't know German.  Tell us what's going on.  The only good thing a German did is build a Volkswagen and a Mercedes-Benz.  I never did right.  And I'm German.  Right.  Well, this is...  My name is Schultz.  Hey, Tippi, this is the...  That's German.  This is the scene that got you sad.  Here it comes. 
[04:44:00]  The Nazis talking to Meryl Streep as she's holding her daughter.  What's going on?  Tell us.  She's protecting her child.  Here we go.  Here we go.  They're going to steal her baby in a tragic movie.  No.  This movie broke my heart.  They stole her baby.  Because it's not the kind of reigning camp in Germany. 
[04:44:30]  No.  No.  It's still her.  The most interesting German.  That movie's so tragic.  It was wrong.  The Germans were wrong. 
[04:45:00]  And I'm German.  And I'm wrong.  I didn't do that.  I would never do that.  That was your people, though.  Yeah.  You know.  Well, I was raised that way, but I'm not that way.  Tom, why are you so upset?  I don't get it.  Yeah, you got so upset watching that clip.  Why are you so upset?  There's tears in your eyes.  It was wrong.  Why'd they take the little baby? 
[04:45:30]  It was wrong.  What was wrong about that?  I'm sure he was taking the kids to get some good health care or something.  In those times, things were different, I guess.  You ain't going to boo that shit now.  Why'd they take the baby, though?  The little baby got taken.  Oh, look.  She's...  Oh, no.  Look, here's the scene.  This is what bothers you?  Yes.  Yes. 
[04:46:00]  It's Meryl Streep.  It's Dara, baby.  That's wrong.  No.  Hey, I was there.  I go fight.  Yeah?  Fight those Nazis?  Yeah, I will.  That's a funny movie, right?  Did you laugh when you watched that movie? 
[04:46:30]  That's funny.  I like movies.  Yeah.  What a rebound.  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony Institute of Art and Literature is proud to present a collection of books on tape  soulfully voiced by the homeless, Tippi Tung.  I can't do as good as a guy to do it, but you know.  Masterpieces like Herman Melville's Moby Dick.  Call me this, Mom.  Some years ago. 
[04:47:00]  Never mind how long precisely.  And Dickens historically themed A Tale of Two Cities.  It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times.  It was the age of wisdom.  Doing a good job.  Okay.  You won't believe your ears as Tom mutters and fumbles his way through Mark Twain's classic, Huck Finn.  Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was under the window of Douglas' protection. 
[04:47:30]  Okay, I guess I'm getting ready.  And then be prepared to have your breath taken away, literally, with his read of Great Expectations.  Heaven knows we'd never be ashamed of our tears.  Okay.  Of course not.  Anyway, I think I got silver. 
[04:48:00]  And finally, you'll enjoy the classic for all ages, Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham.  Great eggs and ham.  No, green eggs and ham.  Yeah, I can't see what my glasses is.  I am Sam.  I am Sam.  Sam, I am.  Come on, man.  I ain't got my damn glasses on.  Who even knew Tippi Tom had glasses?  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's a collection of some of the finest literature ever written and then read by a homeless drunk.

It's Opie and Anthony's Cringe Moments.  A selection of segments that'll make you stare at the radio and say...  What the F was that? 
[04:49:00]  Holy crap.  I'm done.  Yes, you just heard what you thought you heard.  It's Opie and Anthony's Cringe Moments.  You've got to supervise.  You see, he's got the tongue scraper.  That's going to get the goop off his tongue.  But then you've got to make sure the sample goes into that plastic spoon.  All right?  And Steve, it's a good thing that you're there because you'll be the first one, as punishment  for not having the scraper, I feel, that you should be the first one to take a little whiff.  And then you've got to heat up the spoon and inject it. 
[04:49:30]  He's got a scraper.  No, I know that, but it wasn't...  It wasn't to your liking.  Big A, when you do it, make sure you stick your tongue right out because the stuff at  the back's the more heinous.  You've got to stick your tongue out.  Iraq, get in there, Iraq.  Make sure he does it right.  This is how it's done.  And tell him to open his mouth.  Stick your tongue way out.  Go like...  The scraper.  He knows.  He's got it.  Yeah.  Iraq, you collect the sample.  Way in the back.  Oh, my God.  Now scrape.  Iraq, don't move away.  Don't, don't lose it. 
[04:50:00]  Iraq's down.  Come on, it's just a bit of tongue, Gunk.  We all get that.  No, don't be an adult about it.  Iraq's down on the floor.  No!  Oh, Biles coming out of Iraq's down.  Oh, he's wiping his face on a T-shirt.  Okay, do it again.  All right.  Hold on. 
[04:50:30]  No, no, no.  Not do it again.  Not yet.  Do you got a sample on the spoon?  Iraq's got to supervise.  Wait, Steve, what do we got on the spoon so far?  Tapioca pudding.  Steve.  Get a little more.  How about a quick, just a quick sniff?  Steve, a quick sniff.  Looks like Farida.  I'm Mike, of course.  I'm Mike.  Ah!  That reaction took forever.  You dropped the sample.  Don't drop the sample.  No, I didn't drop it.  I didn't drop it.  I didn't drop it.  It's just...  It's concentrated.  Oh, Iraq.  You're not just cute. 
[04:51:00]  No, he's fucking...  Oh, this is...  Big A, don't be upsteady.  Do this for you.  Big A, we're going to get your teeth clean.  Anybody's tongue stuff would make you...  Anybody's tongue stuff would make you...  Big A, in all fairness, I scrape my tongue every morning, and it's horrific, and I really  do try to keep my mouth clean.  I'll get that stuff as well.  I'll get it right now.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  Iraq, get back in there.  No, we need more of a sample. 
[04:51:30]  Iraq, get in there.  Another scraping.  Iraq, get in there.  Hold on.  No, no.  I say one more person takes it off that.  Off that first.  Yeah, Stan is coming next.  All right, Stan.  Stan doesn't care.  That's okay.  You only went to C.  Good.  Okay, here we go.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, look at it.  Oh, my God.  It's like sherbert.  It's a spoonful of sherbert?  What color is it?  There's a nice whitish gray with a little yellow.  It's lumpy, too, right? 
[04:52:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's...  I laughed so hard, my gut hurts.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  That's a good constitution.  You know what?  I'm going in for one.  I have to.  No.  Jimmy, are you going to go in for one?  Come on.  Someone else has to go.  All right, Iraq, get another sample.  Hold on.  We got to get that.  We'll have one more on this one.  Can we get one more on this one?  Let's get more.  Just get more.  Get some fresh stuff.  Iraq, get in there.  Iraq, get in. 
[04:52:30]  Good big scrape on the other side.  Actually, from here, his tongue doesn't look that bad.  Oh, that's not right.  Ah!  What?  Oh, that's not right.  No!  Give me the...  Oh.  Oh.  They're trying to collect...  Iraq's crying.  Iraq is crying.  Look at his eyes.  They're trying to collect the sample.  Oh, you're serious.  It's looking like they're...  It's bleeding, too?  Oh, he's good.  There's blood in it?  Oh, God!  It looks like blood porridge.  Oh! 
[04:53:00]  Oh, it's like...  It's like blood pudding.  Don't lose the sample.  Let me hold the camera for a second.  Get that away from me.  Sam, you got to go in for a sniff.  Sam.  Sam's next.  Get away from me!  Get a mic on Sam!  Get him by the mic.  I've got this...  I see it.  Oh, God!  Sam's...  Sam's throwing up.  Put it down there. 
[04:53:30]  Put it down there again.  Put it down there while he's playing.  Put it down there.  Keep it down.  Keep it down.  Don't lose the sample!  Don't lose it!  Don't lose it!  Wow.  Oh, this is so disgusting.  And when you look down in the garbage can, as you're puking, there's bile already in the garbage can.  Oh, I can't take this.  I can't take this.  Oh, boy.  It's disgusting.  E-Rock, do you have some on your spoon?  I do.  No.  Not really.  All right.  Let's get a...  Let's get another... 
[04:54:00]  One more scrape from the other side, I guess, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, try the side.  The other side.  Yeah.  I'll go ahead.  I'm a big A.  You're a trooper today, bro.  I'm a big A rules.  Free appetizer.  You got a big good one.  Good one.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He just...  What are you on there?  He just scraped out an oyster.  Oh, God damn it.  You guys are unbelievable.  E-Rock, get in there for a sniff of that sample. 
[04:54:30]  Yeah, E-Rock, please.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  No.  E-Rock, one more sniff, E-Rock.  E-Rock, come on.  One more sniff.  I'm trying to...  I like him.  Look out there, man.  Damn, look out.  The pal talk camera.  There you go.  Look at E-Rock.  He jumped back 10 feet and fell on the couch.  E-Rock, will you get in there for a smell?  Come on.  We're telling everyone you're our go-to.  One more sniff.  One more sniff, E-Rock. 
[04:55:00]  E-Rock.  Take a good look at that lumpy stock.  E-Rock.  That lumpy tongue scraping.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Such a professional still holding the marker.  We just found another bit for our pay-per-view, Ant.  Where's our...  Oh, yeah.  Big A, you're going to be part of our pay-per-view with this.  We might not be able to clean your teeth for another month.  Yeah, we got to wait.  By the way, don't forget, we have two more naughty boys. 
[04:55:30]  Okay.  Don't forget Danny and Travis.  Who are those naughty boys?  Kenny, you want in?  What's this?  Kenny!  Come on, Kenny!  And, uh, Roland.  If Kenny does it, I'll do it.  Where's Roland?  Where's Roland?  Bring Roland in.  I can't do it.  Get in here.  Let's get one more scrape done.  Yeah, I don't...  I don't think it will...  Jim Jeffries, would you go in for one?  I'll go in for one.  But I won't...  I've got a pretty good constitution for stinky bread.  Just...  You've been naughty in general.  It's a general naughtiness.  Wait, could...  Should we get another scrape off his tongue?  How much is in the spoon there, Steve? 
[04:56:00]  It's a lot.  It's plenty.  It looks like boogers in pudding.  Oh.  All right.  I'd rather smell it than a banana.  Go ahead, Danny.  All right.  Danny, you've got to brace himself.  You don't have to shove it in my face.  Yeah, this is something you've got to...  Don't touch the spoon, because we don't want to lose the sample.  All right.  Oh, he's gagging.  Oh, he's gagging.  He's gagging. 
[04:56:30]  Danny had more of a cat gag.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was like a hairball.  Right.  Oh, man, that's...  I know what that is, though.  It almost smells like when you're really, really sick.  Like, you know that sick taste that you get in your mouth?  Like, if you've ever had bronchitis or whatever.  Oh, he's got sick.  That just doesn't go away.  It smells like sick.  Yeah, it's sick.  It's like a sick smell.  Holy crap.  What's wrong?  Uh, good boy, Danny.  Travis?  Oh.  Feel free. 
[04:57:00]  Okay.  I got your breathing through your mouth.  Mouth closed, Travis.  Don't try to sneak it.  Yeah.  Right in the nose.  Just smash it into his face.  Not one person can stay up.  Travis?  All right, all right.  That's it?  No.  No, yeah, that's it.  I don't need seconds.  All right.  Oh, look at Tim come in.  Hey, Tim.  All right.  Yeah, that smells bad.  I don't like this food. 
[04:57:30]  You think he's going to smell this food?  Everyone has the same reaction.  Uh, so where's Roland?  Yeah, Roland, come on.  E-Rock.  Have we got any girls in the building this moment?  No, unfortunately, no.  At this stage in our careers, we don't know girls anymore.  Uh, Big A, unfortunately.  Big A, can we get another, like, sample off the tongue?  E-Rock, can you get one more sample off the tongue?  Sorry, Rock, please.  Do some work.  Get a good one, Big A, please.  There's no bad ones. 
[04:58:00]  They're all good ones.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Bad one.  Don't throw up on it.  Get a bit of a...  Oh!  It's on his shirt, here.  Oh, it's on his shirt.  Spap it off his shirt.  Look at these guys.  It's like they're handling, like, a sample of HIV.  They don't want to get close to it.  They're...  What?  Oh, it's all lumpy.  I just saw it.  I got a good look at it.  It looks like Metallica's load cover.  All right, get, uh... 
[04:58:30]  Get, uh...  Get Roland.  Get Intern Ron.  Get Intern Ron.  Come here, stupid.  Come on, young Ron.  You can do it.  Be a big boy.  All right, young Ron.  All right.  Does a great job for us.  This is where you get...  Give me that.  Put it under your tongue.  Put it...  Keep going.  Keep going.  We've got to make him vomit.  Go!  Hey!  Hey!  Oh. 
[04:59:00]  Oh!  Ron, what does that smell like?  Awful.  I can't put it to words.  I don't know what that is.  Oh, my God.  That's unbelievable.  Where's Roland?  And stop sniffing it!  Steve is wonderful.  Steve with that spoon.  Stop sniffing!  He's a gladiator.  And stop sniffing!  Everyone's, like, tearing from the eyes and red. 
[04:59:30]  I wish Dave was here.  He won't come in.  Come on, Roland.  You have to make up for your naughtiness.  Roland, come on!  I would love to see Bob Kelly in this situation.  Oh, my God.  Because he would just be...  Beep!  Beep!  Beep!  Beep!  Oh, dude.  Dude, that was so bad.  Oh, that was so...  Roland, come on, Ron.  Just take one for the team.  Come on, Roland.  Come on, Roland.  Roland.  Roland.  One whiff.  I don't care.  We're leaving for the weekend after.  Now, make sure you smell it.  Don't fake it. 
[05:00:00]  We can tell.  Then you just got to do it again.  Roland, how are you today?  Smash the spoon in here.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, Roland.  Close your mouth.  Roland.  No, smell it.  Roland.  You've got to smell it, Roland.  We'll hold you down if you don't.  You see his arms?  He just went so gay.  He just looked like a baby.  He put his arms up in the air, like...  He was like, oh, I'm going to get you.  He shook his arms back and forth. 
[05:00:30]  He did.  He went like, ooh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, did you see it, Jimmy?  Yeah, he basically...  You got a good look.  Dan said that Roland had a slight seizure right now.  He just had a slight seizure.  Oh, my God.  I am so nauseated.  Jim, you're up.  Bring over the spoon.  No, no, no, no.  Have him go over to it.  Bring the spoon.  I want that nowhere near me.  All right, Jim Jeffries, who's playing Carolines, tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  A very, very funny cover.  212-757-4100. 
[05:01:00]  I do believe he's going to do quite well at Carolines this weekend.  No, no, it's not...  No, it's not...  Yeah.  Run!  No, I know what it does.  Oh, Jesus.  You get a bit of a burn at the end.  It's like wasabi.  It's when it goes up the end towards the hairs and all that. 
[05:01:30]  It's powerful wasabi.  Go on, Norton.  Have a go.  No, can't do it.  I've done some disgusting things.  I can't do it.  Opie, what do you think?  Do me a favor.  You're going to go in?  All right, get another good scraping.  Get one more good scraping.  I don't know.  Get a good, hard, deep scrape.  Right way back.  Almost choke yourself.  There you go.  Ant, are you going to do it?  Ant?  Are you insane?  Are you a mad person?  That would be the great get.  Look at it sliming off on this moon. 
[05:02:00]  I actually thought it was going to be worse.  Although I do feel kind of ill now.  Yeah.  It's looking like cake batter.  All right, Iraq, bring it over.  I'll give it a shot.  What the hell?  I've had a worse tongue than that.  I'm not close to Anthony.  Get away from me.  I swear I'll kill.  I will kill.  I'm not doing the mustache thing, though.  No way.  A quick one.  Just a quick one.  I think smelling it.  Wait, wait.  Don't do that.  Can you get disease of smelling it or not?  I don't think so.  Put it down there.  I just want to look.  Oh, wait. 
[05:02:30]  You're not okay.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Hey, Opie, tongue-scraping mustache.  Come on.  No way.  I don't know if I can do this.  No, I did it.  Go and do it.  Take a good, deep breath through your nose.  It's not that bad.  It's quite a noise.  Jimmy, if I do it, you do it.  I can't do it.  Come on.  I've done a lot.  How about we do a tag team?  I can't do that.  You can't do it.  Well, Kenny.  Kenny.  Me and Kenny.  I'll throw up horribly.  I already feel nauseous. 
[05:03:00]  Oh, my God.  I can smell from here.  Get a good one.  The only reason I'm doing this is that because you sold 160 tickets in the last half hour.  Wow.  160.  160.  Yeah.  Another 160 plus.  So what are we up to?  I don't know.  A sellout is $1,800 for the only animation festival.  People are slowing down.  Don't disappoint your radio heroes.  Tickets are on sale.  June 5th, Rosalind Ball, Ramone Animation Festival.  Yeah.  All right.  Now let me smell this.  Hamilton, Brandt, Kornfeld. 
[05:03:30]  Get a good one.  Kenny, we're going to do a tag team here.  Ready?  Get it over there.  You've got to get right into it.  The first one didn't really hurt me.  Want me to go first?  Yeah, you go first.  Yeah, big Kenny.  Nothing phases him.  No, Kenny is really unfair.  He fell on the floor.  Oh, my God.  He's facing Mecca.  He fell on the floor.  Oh, my God. 
[05:04:00]  Oh, come on.  It wasn't that bad.  Have another go.  It might be better now.  Look at my eyes.  It's not that bad.  His eyes are tearing.  He's crying.  Jimmy, please do this.  He's crying.  Look at Jimmy.  He's backed against the wall.  One of the better reactions.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony's 2008 cringiest moments, and it's come to an end.  I have Vinny Rock.
