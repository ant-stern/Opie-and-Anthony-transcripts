<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in their characteristically vulgar humor, focusing on bodily functions and sexual acts.  They announced the departure of Mel Carverson and discussed the upcoming Liberty Media takeover, speculating on potential changes. Anthony then recounted a lengthy, graphic anecdote about his child vomiting extensively in his car during a stressful Manhattan drive.  The conversation shifted to the new iPhone 5, comparing it unfavorably to the Samsung Galaxy S3 and engaging in speculation about Apple's business practices and rivalry with Google.  Further technology discussions covered styluses, Siri, and cashless transactions. A caller, Frederico, shared his excitement about being on the air and launched into a rambling discussion about government conspiracies and microchipping.

A caller from Calgary expressed concern about societal division.  This transitioned into a rambling, often nonsensical conversation punctuated by laughter.  The hosts then reviewed Sylvester Stallone's *Cobra*, offering sarcastic commentary on its plot, dialogue, acting, and Brigitte Nielsen's appearance, peppered with invented catchphrases like "You're the disease, I'm the cure."  They followed this with a detailed description of a chaotic L.A. bank robbery car chase, focusing on the robbers throwing money out the window. The discussion then turned to the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya, including debates on the government's response, security failures, the role of a movie trailer in provoking the attack (and freedom of speech), and criticisms of MSNBC's coverage. Callers offered conflicting accounts of casualties and the Marines' actions. The segment concluded with the announcement of upcoming guests Big Ang and Bob Kelly.  Throughout, the broadcast contained explicit language and sexually suggestive humor.


A Comic-Con interview with Chip Chipperson (dressed as Toad) followed, featuring discussions of drug use and meeting women at the convention.  In-studio guest Bob Kelly promoted his shows at Levity Live, leading to a detailed discussion of his inflatable Sea Eagle fly fishing boat, including anecdotes about Jim Norton breaking its seat.  The conversation meandered through Kelly's upcoming shows, his child's birth, Opie's website, a photo of a young Bob Kelly, a negative hotel review, Kelly's acid reflux, and a potential TV show.  A listener call-in segment featuring "F.U." messages occurred, along with further discussion of Kelly's shows and appearances by Dan Soto and Kelly Festuca.  The show also briefly touched upon Tony Danza's potential mayoral run and a past show with him, a mysterious guest "Big Ange," and a New Hampshire woodworker/storyteller. The segment heavily featured vulgar language and sexually suggestive humor.


A disastrous "storytelling" segment followed, featuring difficulty finding and playing suitable YouTube videos.  The hosts mocked the low-quality videos, including a disturbing children's story about a one-inch boy.  They repeatedly criticized the audio quality.  They briefly mentioned "Sleeves," whose previous appearances were deemed unsuitable.  Judy Piken's storytelling attempt was met with derision and interruptions, accompanied by crude comments about her appearance.  The segment continued with various short clips, including whistling competitions and a video of maggots in someone's nose, eliciting strong reactions.  Trailers for the hosts' projects were also shown. Big Ang, a reality TV personality, then appeared as a guest.  The conversation covered her life, "Mob Wives," her book "Bigger is Better," cosmetic surgeries, drug arrest, and family, punctuated by offensive comments about her appearance and lifestyle.


Big Ang continued as a guest, promoting her book. The conversation was dominated by vulgar and sexually suggestive banter, including descriptions of a kiss between Big Ang and Jimmy.  Jimmy's departure was marked by more crude jokes.  The discussion then shifted to Bobby Kelly's stand-up comedy experiences, particularly performing for mobsters, interspersed with crude humor and ethnic stereotypes.  Big Ang's husband's size and intimidating presence were repeatedly referenced humorously.  Brian Posehn then joined, discussing his career, work on sitcoms and Marvel Comics (Deadpool), and experiences at Comic-Con.  A graphic scene from *Sons of Anarchy* prompted a lengthy discussion about on-screen violence, with callers weighing in.  Posehn detailed gruesome on-set anecdotes from Rob Zombie's *The Devil's Rejects*.  The show ended with casual conversation about Posehn's career and personal life.


Finally, Brian Posehn's segment continued, focusing on his evolving comedic material, including self-deprecating humor about his appearance and personal life.  He discussed his wife's acceptance of his flaws and the different reactions he received from various audiences, particularly female fans of his dark humor. He mentioned his upcoming shows at Caroline's Comedy Club and experiences performing for fans versus general audiences, including encounters with fans from the metal music scene. The interview concluded with promotion of his upcoming shows and social media information.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Anthony show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And conventions burn to the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking jackass?  With Opie, the destroyer.  Hey, asshole.  Just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony, the rage.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rag down the fucking  hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  Ha ha.  Voices.  Hey, everybody.  Hello.  Morning.  I think I was just here, right?  I don't know. 
[00:02:00]  I think I just stepped out for a few minutes and then came back in.  Well, we're back.  Yes.  It's gonna be back.  Bye.  For now.  Wow.  Wow.  What is everyone sending me?  I guess our boss is leaving and everyone's tweeting articles about it.  In the paper?  The paper, the paper.  Well, there's a big article today that Mel Carverson's leaving us.  Any date on that?  We've known Mel for many, many years.  Many, many years.  Mel.  Although I haven't had a conversation with him in probably... 
[00:02:30]  Years.  Many, many years.  Two years.  In a while.  Not even a conversation with the guy.  Yeah, I saw him recently.  We'll see what happens.  He's gonna say hi.  Like, I mean, I'm not saying he hates me, but I don't think he likes me too much.  I probably hate you.  You might be right.  I saw him at the...  Last time I saw him was at the McCartney show, I think.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And he nodded at you?  I had a couple words.  He's good at nodding at you.  A couple words?  Oh, I had a conversation with him recently.  He was getting in the elevator and he goes, 
[00:03:00]  Hey, you still work here?  Like, real funny.  That's hilarious.  Maybe you should be asking that about Howard.  Oh, boy.  Not us.  The guys that are actually coming here every day.  Yump in Yemeni.  But I guess Liberty Media is about to take over this joint.  Liberty.  Hope they like us.  For your diabetes supplies.  Believe me, dude.  I want to get my name on something quickly.  I know.  Who knows?  They could be like CBS.  We love open hand, but...  Yeah.  We don't know about the other guy. 
[00:03:30]  He's too dirty.  Oh, God.  I hope that happens.  I mean, I mean, I mean.  Oh, man.  We got a new suitor.  Like my ex.  Yes, we do.  We got a new suitor.  A suitor.  We might have a new girlfriend soon.  Could there be a romance in the air?  Or maybe not.  Or maybe not.  Maybe we're not her type.  This shit is going down soon, man.  Yeah.  And we'll see.  That usually means a bunch of changes.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes.  Yeah, motherfucker. 
[00:04:00]  Do you remember that from The Comeback?  Did you see The Comeback?  Oh, yeah.  When she's in the house and the stepdaughter comes in and asks her advice on something and  she goes, whoa.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes.  It's the most uncomfortable.  Oh, it's so douchey.  The Comeback rules.  Yeah, that was a douchey shit.  Oh, yeah.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes.  That's fucking...  Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.  Self-Jersey Rich goes, yeah, Fareed is coming.  No.  Oh, my God. 
[00:04:30]  Forreed.  I might have wrote Fareed recently.  No.  Oh, yeah.  How could you even talk to him?  I might have wrote Fareed recently.  What a fucking piece of shit.  I wrote...  I've talked to Elo.  I wrote Fareed.  He wrote me back.  Oh, did he?  Has he got some stock tips?  I'm looking at my options.  Stock tips?  We're all looking at our options.  Jesus Christ.  Hi, Freed.  What's going on with you?  Oh, God.  Dude, it was the worst thing.  She was just trying to express her joy that her stepdaughter had asked her something. 
[00:05:00]  She had on those awful sweatpants that are windy sweatpants.  Hammer time, sweatpants.  I think it was the plastic ones, if I remember.  Whoa.  Change.  Are you a big fan of the girls that walk around the streets in their pajama pants?  I like that.  It's becoming a thing.  Oh, my God.  I like that a lot.  You get to see their loose hineys.  It's comfy.  Their loose hineys.  Loose but taut.  Yeah, it's good. 
[00:05:30]  Taunt or taut?  Taut.  I like that, though.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It moves around, but it moves around in a solid mass.  You know what I'm saying?  I hear you.  It's not like a mudslide happening back there.  Mudslide.  You want to hear a cute little story about a kid puking?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Projectile?  Oh, my God.  The first time a kid puked in my fucking car.  Would that drive you nuts?  You would throw the car away, right?  I have to.  You would have to throw your car away.  And the kid.  I'd torch it.  And the kid.  And the kid. 
[00:06:00]  If my kid wasn't so cool, we would have had a problem yesterday.  Oh, man.  I understand some things.  I understand some things parents do.  Oh, no.  No.  What happened?  Well, I was getting my car serviced.  And I told the guy.  I said, look, I need the car before rush hour because I got to get the fuck out of town.  I got some shit to do.  Living in the limelight.  I got to get my lunatic sister out of my fucking house and pass her on to somebody else. 
[00:06:30]  So get the fucking car done before rush hour, please.  My sister is up from Florida.  My half-sister.  Although, I mean, she's my sister.  But for discussion purposes, she's from my dad's first marriage.  The one that went horribly bad.  Thus, then, marrying my crazy mom.  And what I mean by going bad, meaning dying at a very, very early age.  Oof.  I think she was like 26 or something.  That's the only reason I'm here. 
[00:07:00]  Because my dad's first true love.  His high school sweetheart died.  But anyway, that's his kid and my sister from his first marriage.  And man, she was telling me some fucking, some horror fucking stories about my mom.  And I don't want, I just like, look, I want to just fucking live my life.  I don't want to go back there anymore.  Yeah.  So it was time to get rid of my sister and move her on to somebody else.  But the fucking guy didn't get my car done in time.  And so I had to leave the city in rush hour to go north, uh, north Jersey for the locals. 
[00:07:30]  I had to go over to GWB at 530.  Yeah.  I could hear it right now.  I could hear it in their voices.  Like, oh fuck, seriously?  I'm like, yeah.  Because I'm not, I'm not a nine to fiver.  So I luck out.  I don't have to fucking drive in that shit.  Yeah.  It's one of the things we're lucky about.  It's terrible.  So I decide, uh, to go Broadway up to the GWB.  Have you ever done Broadway up to the GWB?  That means staying in Manhattan.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I got my kid in the back because I want him to have, uh, to, you know, go say hi to  his cousins up there.  So I'm fucking making moves.  Uh-oh.  I'm doing some Anthony Cumia shit.  Oh no.  Oh no.  I'm making some moves.  Not for the delicate little stomachs.  Well, that's what I learned, unfortunately.  Oh no.  My first mistake was I didn't put his movie on.  What I've learned from a very, uh, very early stage in this whole thing, you put a  movie on for your fucking kid if you're in a car.  You got it.  Because that's what we got nowadays. 
[00:08:30]  We're lucky.  I forgot to put his movie on.  Because what happens is his dumb little eyes, and I mean dumb in the sweetest, nicest way,  by the way, because I love my kid to death and I would fucking, uh, kill someone over  him.  Uh, when they, when they focus on the fucking screen, they don't notice the motion of the  car.  The moves, right.  So that was my first mistake.  Oh no.  And then I'm making the Anthony Cumia moves where I'm fucking stop, go, stop, go, fucking  moving to this lane.  Now I got to cut over here.  I'm going through this fucking red light.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden he starts, um, asking for his mom. 
[00:09:00]  Oh no.  Am I, like when I left mom home because she's very pregnant.  Oh no.  And when we like go, uh, separate, the kid's usually cool.  He understands like, Oh, I don't need mommy and daddy.  I got daddy.  I'm cool.  But he starts whining for mommy.  And I'm like, that's a little weird too.  That was, that was sign number two.  Sign number two.  That was just not acknowledged.  And then he starts whimpering and I'm like, that's weird.  But he's been sick.  We've both been sick.  I'm like, all right, he's still dealing with shit.  And then, uh, and then I looked at his eyes and they were a little fucked up. 
[00:09:30]  Parents know this.  You can look at your kid's eyes and realize they're a little fucked up.  Oh no.  And I'm like, ah.  So, uh, make a long story short, right around Spanish Harlem, way up there in the 130s, 140s.  He fucking power boots at a red light.  I mean, everywhere.  Oh.  I mean, everywhere.  What the little guy have to eat. 
[00:10:00]  There was a hunk of cheese in there that made me almost puke.  There was a hunk of cheese that came out.  Oh no.  That's what got me.  It was, it was brown.  It was brownish in nature.  Look at that.  Oh, shoot.  Just because baby vomit goes everywhere.  Oh man.  It's just power boots.  Sure.  He's in the back seat and he's in a car baby seat.  Right in the middle of the back seat.  Right.  Facing forward or back?  Facing forward, man.  Oh.  Just, I mean, all for the intricate fucking seatbelts of the baby seat. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, yeah.  All those little harnesses.  Nooks and crannies.  And little buckles.  His little, uh, little, uh, polo shirt is completely soaked in puke.  He gets motion sick.  Yeah.  He's got it.  Oh man.  And, uh, and I go to my sister, I go, look, I can't pull over.  This is the worst part of Manhattan.  Oh man.  I mean, I was at one red light and I could get my sister on the phone to back me  up.  There were gangs yelling at each other from across the street.  Right.  And then I'm looking like a, I'm looking around like a horrified white guy. 
[00:11:00]  And then there's guys in the median, you know, in between the lanes laughing at me.  They're like, yep, this shit is going down and you're sitting here right now at a red  light.  Oh shit.  It's basically what they told me with their eyes.  And I'm like, oh fuck.  So I go, I can't, I can't fucking stop.  And from that point to the GWB, I can't stop.  So at every light, we're both, we're both turning around with wipes and just wiping  up just, just mucusy puke.  Was he, was he trying?  Nah, because at that point he was cool.  Now he's like, Hey, I want to watch my fucking movie. 
[00:11:30]  Feel good now.  Kids don't understand messes.  They don't give a fuck.  It's, it's, it's, you care about the mess.  So every light turning around, every light just soaking it up and putting it in a plastic  bag.  And my sister's now dry heaving because she can't take puke.  Now you got to soak that up.  Those big pieces of brain and skull.  You got to get that up.  Yeah.  I need the wolf.  I needed the wolf.  I needed the wolf.  Where's the fucking wolf? 
[00:12:00]  And then we're going over the GWB, just, just cleaning up puke all the way to my brother's  house in Jersey.  Let's not start sucking each other's dicks just yet, gentlemen.  Right.  Yeah.  And it still smells like puke, by the way.  Oh man.  Ah.  Well, that's the problem with living in the city.  You can't just pull over somewhere and hose it down.  There's nowhere to, there's nowhere to pull over.  There's literally nowhere to pull over in Manhattan.  So how long did you drive with that smell?  Like a half hour.  I decided to go for it.  Cause at that point my sister did an amazing job cleaning it up. 
[00:12:30]  So now he was just kind of soaked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  Phew.  And the worst part of Manhattan.  So what happened when you got there?  You took the car seat out, you hosed everything off?  No, I did not.  I wanted to socialize.  Oh.  No, I didn't want to waste my time.  Let it all crusty.  Cause remember I said I had to go in rush hour?  So I got there at seven.  I mean, I have to be in bed by nine thirty.  I only had a couple hours.  Oh my God.  To be with my brother and his kids.  Phew.  We put them, we got new clothes on them and stuff. 
[00:13:00]  You know, I gave them like a washcloth bath.  Clean them up, yeah.  Does the car smell now?  Yeah.  When I pulled back into my building, it still smelled.  I asked for some Febreze.  I just sprayed it down.  I said, look, I'll just fucking deal with this.  I gotta go.  But it still smells.  That's gonna be horrific by today.  I'd have to go.  You would throw the whole car away, right?  I'd have to.  You can get it out though, cause I talked to Ruby who drives me a lot and he said that,  you know, it happens.  Sometimes a dog will puke in the car or a kid.  He goes, it comes out.  If you get the car detailed, it'll come out. 
[00:13:30]  Ruby didn't say it happens like when Ope's kid is in my car.  No, he told me that's how the conversation started.  You know about that?  This is the first time my kid has puked in my actual car, but he has puked twice in Ruby's car.  Oh man.  And Ruby is an OCD freak about his cars.  He has a, what is it?  A Mercedes?  He picks me up.  Or BMW.  He has a bunch.  I get the older Mercedes.  It's 10 years old, but it looks like he just bought it.  That's what I'm getting at.  He has a Mercedes that's 10 years old.  I swear to you, if you didn't know, I don't know cars. 
[00:14:00]  I would have sworn it was a brand new fucking car.  I did think it was new.  I had no idea that it was 10 years old.  My kid puked in that car on the way home from the airport after our big trip to Turks and Caicos.  Oh boy.  One mile from the house.  I think I told the story.  Almost made it.  Yeah.  And he's like, don't worry about it.  And I'm like, I'm kind of like you.  I'm like, how much to make this go away?  And I'm just peeling off money.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got to give him a quick gratitude.  Can you just clean up my kid's puke, but I'll make it worth your while.  Good gratuity must be given in that circumstance.  And then we rented a van when my wife graduated from college. 
[00:14:30]  It was a big deal.  We had to go up to Fordham's, but I needed a big, huge, fucking nice vehicle to get everyone  up there for the graduation ceremonies.  He puked in that, too.  Jesus.  So he's puked in two of Ruby's cars.  That's a good suggestion from a fish man here.  You need a dog, Opie, to clean the kid off after it pukes.  Dogs love vomit.  They really do.  It's nice and warm.  It's probably like a Friendly's Fribble to them.  Oh, God, no. 
[00:15:00]  He'd be there.  My dog, Fresca, rest his soul.  He would lap up puke when we were growing up.  He would lap it up like it was nothing.  That's pretty disgusting.  Like a rock star, he would lap that shit up.  Yeah.  And you know what those stupid tongues would get in the nooks and crannies?  Oh, every nook and cranny.  Dogs are great like that.  Of the intricate seat belt.  That's why women love that peanut butter trick.  They get right in there.  Oh, yeah.  Hit the clit and the folds behind the labia.  Everything.  Right.  Places guys won't even go. 
[00:15:30]  Yep.  Yeah, dogs are like maggots on a fucking wound when they eat pussy.  That's when you know you're a lovey kid, though.  I didn't even give a fuck.  I mean, if you were in the car, you'd be out of your mind, obviously.  Oh, of course.  I'm not stupid.  But when it's yours, you don't fucking care, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just don't care.  Nature blocks that stuff out.  It's weird.  So you could take care of...  Yeah.  It does a certain amount of that.  I was bothered slightly, I would be, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  The radio wizard bothers me way more just walking past the studio than what happened yesterday. 
[00:16:00]  He's puked in your car?  Oh, if he puked in my car, I would throw him off the GWB.  I would stop the car and I would actually throw him over the side.  Something tells me if he was in your car on the GWB, you'd throw him off.  Oh, absolutely.  It doesn't matter.  Something tells me he would get out before the bridge.  He would know better.  He walked past me yesterday and knew not to say a word.  He just was defeated again.  Yeah.  The poor radio wizard.  Maybe Mel could take him with him. 
[00:16:30]  But that...  I don't know where the story goes, but that's what happened to me.  That's all you really need.  It was...  It was...  I guess the highlight puking in the worst part of Manhattan.  I think it's Spanish Harlem, isn't it?  Broadway way up there?  I don't even know.  Is that West?  No, I don't think it's Spanish.  It's past Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard, which is nice because that's the heart of Harlem.  I actually ride my bike down on Martin Luther King Boulevard now.  East is Harlem.  Spanish Harlem.  So what's on the west side?  Just Harlem.  It's bad.  Goes up into Inwood or Washington Heights. 
[00:17:00]  It gets weird and bad up there.  Oh, man.  And you see a lot of...  I'll just say you see a lot of colors.  What street?  A lot of colors.  Not colored.  Right, right.  Because you do see colored going old school, but you see a lot of colors, if you know what  I mean.  And I don't even want to say which colors because I don't want to piss off the other colors.  Oh, they're all kinds.  Oh, gagging me.  Yeah, yeah.  Wonderful, colorful.  But you see them.  They're like, yeah, that's right.  This is what we are.  Yeah.  And there's more than one color.  Yeah.  There's groups of colors, I should say. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah.  And there's colors I've never seen.  Yellow?  Well, there might have been some yellow.  Yeah.  You know yellow.  Or gold, whatever the one is.  I think the Latin Kings are gold.  Yeah, that's Latin Kings.  That's why I'm not mentioning which colors.  There might have been that color up there.  And reds and blues, everyone knows.  But usually you see maybe one guy with one color.  You know you're in a bad area when you see colors.  Two guys.  Yeah.  Colors.  You were at Broadway and what?  It was past Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard. 
[00:18:00]  I don't know where that's...  If you go on a map, that's the part of Manhattan where it starts getting narrow.  Is that...  Between Martin Luther King Boulevard and the GWB, it gets a bit shady.  Yeah.  Dr. Martin Luther King.  Way crazier.  Do they spell it T-I-N or do they spell it properly M-A-R-T-H-A?  M-A-R-T-H...  What?  Oh, Mayor Menino.  Oh, yeah.  Martin Luther King Boulevard.  As we travel to Martin Luther King Boulevard. 
[00:18:30]  Is that the GWB?  Yeah, I don't know what area it is.  Someone help us out.  I have no idea.  You might have been beyond Harlem.  No, no, no, no, no.  Beyond Harlem.  Go to...  Where's Martin Luther King Boulevard?  It's way before that there, Sam.  Way...  Keep going down.  Is it 120...  134th?  Yeah, it's somewhere...  Might be 134th.  It's somewhere...  Yeah, see Dr. Martin Luther King...  Martin Luther King Boulevard.  No, 1...  That's 125th. 
[00:19:00]  4th.  I actually ride my bike and I do...  I hang out in that part of Harlem because there's a lot of culture and a lot of shit to see.  And during the day, especially, I don't feel like I'm in danger.  Is that where the Apollo is?  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Right on Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard.  I'm telling you, it's kind of cool to check out if you're ever in New York.  Because people ask me all the time, don't go to Times Square.  Fucking go up to Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard.  And I'm not joking.  And walk around during the day.  I wouldn't suggest that at night because I don't know that fucking... 
[00:19:30]  But it's cool up there.  I think it's busy enough at night.  It's like I Am Legend.  No, you can walk around during the day, but then at night, you know, you got to go back  to your house, pour bleach on the stairs, and lock the doors.  I don't know if it's a problem at night.  I'm not sure.  Harlem used to be the culture center of the world.  Ah.  So there's some cool shit to check out up there.  I wouldn't go wandering off Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard too much, but I would definitely  take that stroll during the day.  Google Maps ought to have like, you know, they got the satellite view and the traffic  view.  They ought to have an overlay for white people where it just like shows just red borders 
[00:20:00]  and boundaries.  But my point, 125, that's fine.  But I was way higher.  And it gets...  Oh, that looks nice.  There's...  That's fine.  That's fine.  A little subway, a little Lincoln fried chicken.  Lincoln fried chicken?  I'll bet you it's really good.  I bet.  Wait, are you at the start of Martin Luther King Boulevard, Sam?  Let's Google...  Let's take a ride down Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard on Google Maps.  And this is your assignment, Sam, if you don't mind. 
[00:20:30]  I want to know how many chicken joints.  And I want to know the names of them too.  I like Lincoln fried chicken.  That's a good one.  We start with Lincoln fried chicken.  They use the name of Abraham Lincoln.  But you get higher, like 25 to 30 blocks higher.  And you will not see English on any of the storefronts.  It's...  Wow.  Wow.  Pretty crazy.  Wow, yeah.  Oh, well, we're on street view.  Apple came out with an iPhone announcement yesterday. 
[00:21:00]  And?  Looked pretty good.  You know, it's a little longer.  They kept the same width, so you could still use one hand and a thumb to do your little texting.  Your old Docs can you use?  No.  Give me your brand new Doc.  The Lightning, is it called?  Wait, brand new Doc, so you have to change all your shit?  I hate when cell phones do that.  There's an adapter or just a brand new cord.  Yeah, but the adapter will cost you too, right?  Well, of course, yeah.  To adapt to your old cords? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, it's a faster connection.  It's smaller, and it fits both ways.  So, you know, it's not just a one.  Well, there's always a reason why they do it, but they want that extra...  They want the accessory money.  I don't think it's that as much as...  The new phone is thinner.  There's a lot more shit in it, electronics-wise, so they had to make the connector smaller to  fit all the goodies in there and stuff, so that's what they say.  But I don't think it's exclusively like, hey, let's make some money on an adapter.  Well, my experience when I was in the BlackBerry world, which I'm way out of, I fucking hate 
[00:22:00]  BlackBerry.  I'm done with them.  You're not alone.  We'll never go back.  But I hung in there way longer than I should have.  They had the phone charger where they just changed it just because they wanted to fucking  make you buy, you know, that, you know, the car adapter and everything else that goes with  it.  It went from just being sort of, well, everyone knows, and then they just made it just slightly  skinnier.  Yeah.  There was no reason to do that except, look, this is another way we can make money, and 
[00:22:30]  probably why they're just a shitty company.  They blew it.  They had such a fucking lead in the smartphone world.  And they blew it.  There's a reason, you know, so they say, for this one, for this change.  But they also know that, you know, extra money will roll in.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Let me see.  Put this up against the Samsung Galaxy 3.  The standard iPhone now?  That's just the way it is now.  You're saying that it's not wider?  Yeah, it's going to be. 
[00:23:00]  So.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, it's not going to be any wider than that.  Than this?  Yeah.  But it's going to be another half inch taller.  Look how much bigger my fucking Galaxy 3 is.  Will the screen be the same length or no?  The screen's going to be another half inch longer.  It's longer.  Longer.  And no wider?  No wider.  Why?  That's a little, it's more, it's like fucking Letterboxd.  It's kind of weird, isn't it?  I like the size of Opsford.  The Galaxy S3 that, because people are like, you've got to get it.  I was, whatever. 
[00:23:30]  I was going to go off on something that doesn't matter to anybody.  But the S3, I don't feel like I have a huge phone in my pocket.  I really don't.  Yeah.  They felt like they wanted to keep it where it's very handy in one hand.  Like I text with my thumb all the time.  I just, one thumb, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Look what I do.  Yeah, but you know what?  Look what I do.  But you're a guy, you know, you get a chick with small hand.  Dude.  All of a sudden she, you know, like Voss.  Look how sad these hands are.  They're pathetic. 
[00:24:00]  They just decided they were going to keep it like this, width-wise.  Hmm.  Very interesting.  I'd like to wider, a little wider.  Sure.  Dude, the wideness of this phone, it just makes seem.  No, I know it's not, but it just looks like it in this fucking picture.  One hand, a big fat hand on the left, and a thinner hand.  Wait, put yours up in the air again. 
[00:24:30]  No, man, that's going to look weird to be a little longer.  A little longer.  And why are they making it a little longer then?  To the display as far as fitting a few more things on your screen.  A few more apps and shit.  Yeah.  And for the video.  Yeah, but for the video, I don't know.  I think you're going to need wider before longer.  Do you watch, I don't watch video on my phone unless it's a quick Twitter.  I watch video all the time now.  I watch a lot of video on my phone.  Never.  I watch a lot on my phone.  Because I don't like, it's so, like I see people on planes sometimes. 
[00:25:00]  I'll see them, it's amazing how uncomfortable people are willing to be.  They'll sit there and they'll hold it sideways and watch a movie.  What the fuck do you do?  First of all, why are you holding it?  It's so small.  I wouldn't do that and watch a movie.  It's like looking through a Viewmaster.  Yeah.  An iPad or something.  I saw the Galaxy, what is it called, Samsung Note.  Wow.  What is it?  I think the businessmen love that fucking thing.  Oh, the iPad?  It's big.  It's like my phone, but it goes out to about here.  Let the record show.  About an inch and a half wider, probably. 
[00:25:30]  And I was talking to a kid in the cell phone store.  This kid, Greg.  Greg!  Greg!  And yeah, he's just one of these fucking Manhattan fucking hip dudes.  He's 16 and already knows everything about the world.  And he was showing me.  He put it in his back pocket.  He's like, look, I don't notice at all, man.  But it's big.  And you gotta sit on it.  But, basically what they're saying is, you don't need your stupid iPad.  It's big enough where pretty much everything you're doing on the iPad, you can get away with on the note. 
[00:26:00]  Are new iPads the same size or are they smaller?  iPads the same size.  What?  Oh, the new ones are coming out the same size?  Oh, later.  Okay.  But, yeah.  I like the iPad, though.  Like, if I go home and I don't want to, like, watching something on the iPhone is too small.  But I don't feel like, you know, having the computer open and running.  The iPad's great for that.  And I like the size of it.  I don't think they should make it smaller.  I agree.  Like, because it's not a thing that I carry around with me.  But I do like having it, you know, up in the bedroom. 
[00:26:30]  You just...  It's amazing.  You've got it in your hand.  It's amazing.  I'm watching HBO Go on it.  I have it set up.  For some reason, I can't log in on my laptop like a fucking asshole.  Oh!  I don't know what the belief...  Don't get...  But it's fucking awesome.  Except the volume on the iPads.  But when Bob Kelly told me about the iPad a few years ago, he goes, dude, you know, you're  going to touch it.  It's going to be like a touch screen.  I'm like, yeah.  It just didn't make sense to me.  We laughed.  Right.  I remember this show laughing.  Yeah, it's silly.  Wouldn't you just have a laptop?  We laugh at Bobby a lot with his technology. 
[00:27:00]  No, but he's usually right.  Then he's right.  Fucking asshole.  But even after Bobby came and went, we're like, this iPad thing is the dumbest idea.  Why would you do that?  It was too much of a hybrid thing.  And now we totally...  Between the phone and the laptop.  Yeah.  We all get it.  What is that stylus?  What the fuck is that stylus?  A stylus.  Of a galaxy.  Who uses a stylus?  You don't have to use the stylus.  Why don't they stop with that?  You know what?  I think that fucked up the marketing of this thing, because the stylus, everyone's like,  why would you go backwards and use a stylus?  That looks terrible. 
[00:27:30]  The stylus is just an option.  Right.  But I don't think they made that clear when they were trying to market this note.  Is it a smart stylus?  They should put it down, and then the guy could use his finger and show either way.  That's terrible.  Because the stylus could be convenient, to be honest with you, but you don't have to use  it if you want to use the Galaxy Note.  God, the stylus.  Sticking the stylus up his ass and then using his finger.  A cuke.  But the note is made for the business guy, where he could leave his fucking iPad at home  and has his phone and a screen big enough to get all his shit done and watch shit as 
[00:28:00]  well.  Do you remember styluses, how advanced they looked on smartphones and stuff?  With the little slot for it.  And everyone lost their stylus.  Everyone did.  That was the problem.  It was nothing you could fucking hang on to.  I didn't know what to do with my hair.  I lost my stylus.  Then you didn't know where to get a new one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, they still have to figure that out.  Writing down, like actually handwriting on a smart glass is not perfected yet.  It just looks shitty.  It looks shitty, but usually now they convert it to regular text. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, okay.  Let's get there.  Siri's getting better, too, I noticed.  Maybe I'm just talking clearly.  There's a new option, too.  Well, there's new additions to Siri on the new iPhone also, where it includes sports scores  and whatnot, so you could just say, Siri, what's the score of the Yankee game?  And it'll give you the score during the game and shit like that.  What else are you getting with the iPhone 5?  You get a longer display.  Yeah.  Longer display.  New chipset.  What's that?  Wow, that was cool. 
[00:29:00]  What they just did on the note in the video.  They're actually using the finger now.  There was video on top of the screen, and the guy took his finger and dragged the video  to the bottom of the screen.  That was pretty fucking cool.  The note is, for someone like you, Jimmy, that travels, you might want to look into  it as just a little, maybe a second phone or something.  If you've got two phones, I mean...  Well, I do.  I mean, instead of having two iPhones, you might want to look into that just to see.  I have a good boy phone and a naughty boy phone.  Ooh.  Naughty boy phone and a good boy phone. 
[00:29:30]  I like the...  What else about this?  They have like a passbook feature where you store...  Could you go to the Apple thingy?  Are people blown away by this announcement?  It's just time for a new phone from Apple.  It's time for a new phone.  Are they blown away with what they were told yesterday?  No.  You know what?  I think it's become such commonplace now.  It's very hard to blow people away.  Like, the initial announcement of the iPhone was unbelievable.  A couple of the other improvements.  But now it's like, all right, it's just a new iPhone. 
[00:30:00]  What's the headline here?  Just a longer screen?  Yeah, yeah.  The change in the design.  That seems weird to me.  I would have went slightly wider before longer.  They do have some features that were taken directly from the Samsung thing.  The Pano.  Rip it off Samsung?  It's pretty good.  Those motherfuckers.  Like that.  The face recognition.  Yeah.  Things like coupons and airline boarding passes and whatnot, you store in your passbook and 
[00:30:30]  just scan things that way.  Which is, I kind of like where that's headed.  I kind of like having some of your shit on your phone where you can pay for things and  get those, whatever, discount if that's what you're doing.  Other countries have been doing that for a while.  Scan things.  Like if you, like let's say.  Starbucks has is one of the only ones, right?  Movie theaters.  Like if you buy a ticket online, I like the idea that you just have your phone, you walk  in, you don't have to fucking look or talk to anybody.  You just pass by something and it scans it and you know it's paid for and that's that. 
[00:31:00]  I like that idea.  I like taking fucking the human equation out of things.  I love it.  That's what we're doing.  Yes.  You can board your plane and this is the weird part, this happened after 9-11.  Yeah.  You can board your plane, not talking to anybody until you get the security with carry on or  you don't have to talk to any gate agents or anything.  Yeah, yeah.  You self-check out.  I don't like that.  What do you mean?  I self-check out.  I do too at CVS, it rules.  Oh, oh, what?  At CVS?  Yeah.  CVS has it too. 
[00:31:30]  I haven't seen that.  I usually still go up to the fucking Spanish girl behind the counter.  CVS has self-check out.  CVS, but then they have a dummy just standing there at self-check out, so then I'm thinking,  well, why don't you get your ass behind a fucking cash register?  Yeah.  It seems like a waste.  They're always just trotting around with one person behind the counter.  I like that self-check out.  Yeah.  What else do we got there, Samuel, on the iPhone, the big announcement yesterday?  I was pissed because I couldn't find the actual video feed of the keynote. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know if they do it.  Do they broadcast it?  They do it late.  Is the iPhone?  Because I saw, like, everybody covering it.  I saw a bunch of, like, podcasts of people covering it, but there was no actual video.  That was kind of annoying.  Is the iPhone still made in China?  Of course.  Well, you don't have to show the keynote.  What do you mean, of course?  Just show, like, the features.  Why couldn't Apple figure out how to make that shit in America?  Because of that.  I understand possible that.  I'm going to blame the unions.  I'll blame the unions. 
[00:32:30]  Wow, man.  We got union guys listening right now.  I know we do.  What the fuck?  They also know that.  What the fuck?  Why the fuck would Apple go, yeah, you know, I have some national pride and I want it made  in the United States, but this guy makes $57 an hour when I could have some cute little  Asian kid soldering it together.  Oh, these are all made in China?  Yeah.  That would be a big fucking, you know, uh, what, pump, um, I don't, uh, a big, uh, let's 
[00:33:00]  say, uh, influx of, uh, work into the economy.  An economic boost.  Sure.  And that, thank you, an economic boost for America.  You know, there's, there's a, there's a, there's a mid-ground between, uh, management and labor  that, uh, it's just, when you get a labor union, it's so that way that, that, uh, a manufacturer  is going to lose money by making things in the United States.  Or have to charge.  Like, you're paying, what, $400 or $500 for an iPhone, they'll go, okay, we'll make it 
[00:33:30]  here, but it's going to be $1,000 for the iPhone.  Right.  People aren't going to buy it in the, it's just.  Exactly.  The same people that are bitching about jobs leaving the country won't buy it because it's  too expensive.  Uh, but, but the truth of the matter is, the unions were good years ago when, when labor  was fucking completely taking, uh, when management was completely taking advantage of, uh, the  labor force.  I understand that.  But it's gone so far the other way with unions that a lot of companies can't afford to have  American labor anymore, uh, that, making things. 
[00:34:00]  It's too expensive.  Right.  That's why we don't make anything.  We were, we're a, we're a consuming country.  We don't make anything anymore.  We should be making the iPhone and all Apple products here.  Oh my God.  Apple.  Yeah.  Apple is so.  Parts are made in the U S but, uh, the majority of the, just.  I'm sure.  Stuck together in China.  Apple seems like one of those companies where they try to do the right thing.  Yeah.  To a point.  And then like, look, we can't, we got to go to China.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, America.  The front facing cam, uh, is also the one that faces you is also now a 780p. 
[00:34:30]  Uh, you could do FaceTime over your cellular connection.  Wow.  Um.  Wait, cellular?  You mean with a 3G or 4G?  Yeah.  And they also have the LTE now, which is a lot faster.  What's that?  Uh, it's part of the, um, data exchange, um, on your cellular provider.  Yeah.  Provider.  If you get good service, it can, it can be faster than Wi-Fi.  Faster than Wi-Fi.  And it's over cellular.  For your data.  Over cellular.  So when can you use LTE?  Whenever, whenever you're in, um. 
[00:35:00]  LTE service.  LTE service.  Yeah.  Oh, it's another.  I think AT&T Verizon, uh, has it.  So you don't have to worry.  You'll have LTE.  Wow.  Have you used the self-checkout on the phone itself, like in the Apple Store?  Yes.  Once.  It's crazy.  You download the app real quick.  What do you mean?  You self-checkout on Apple.  Like you scan, you download the Apple Store app on the phone.  You do everything yourself and just walk out of the store.  Yeah, you scan.  Without talking to anybody.  You take the product off the shelf.  Yeah.  You scan it.  Yeah.  It takes your credit card from iTunes that it already has.  Yeah.  You click pay, and then you just hold it, and you can either ask someone for a bag, or just walk out. 
[00:35:30]  How do you know they have that service?  You don't know about that service?  They told me when I was checking out.  All Apple Stores have it.  Oh, all Apple Stores.  Apple Stores.  Yeah.  Okay.  I thought you were just somewhere, anywhere.  You're just going, I'd just start scanning things and walk out with my merchandise.  It's cool, because you really feel like you're stealing, which is kind of fun for everyone.  That is fucking great, because I don't like waiting on those lines.  You feel like you're going to get pulled down to the ground, even though it's all on the 
[00:36:00]  up and up, but you're like, there's something about this not right.  What if you just make it look like you're doing it, and you walk out of the store?  I'm sure an alarm goes off.  Yeah, there's got to be something in the back that tallies things up and stuff like that.  You think they haven't figured that out?  I know.  Of course they have.  Yeah, they got something.  But all stores will have that.  You won't be asking for help.  You'll just be checking your shit out and walking.  It's going to be like, the future is just going to be these empty stores with people  walking by.  Boop.  Boop.  Boop. 
[00:36:30]  Boop.  That's the checkout sound.  And it won't be a phone.  It'll be a...  It would cost...  Oh, go ahead, Jim.  I'll say a you-know-what in your finger.  Yeah.  Like, what, the movies and stuff like that?  Oh, that's just going to come off the little fucking chip with that in your finger or your  eye.  A retina scan will take care of everything.  Is this on air or is this a commercial for the iPhone?  Hey, fucko.  Just block him.  It was just announced yesterday.  It's called news.  It's called what's happening in the world, you fucking idiot. 
[00:37:00]  That's right.  Shut up!  Block Bill G.  I...  I get it.  If I see your name fucking pop up, I'm bouncing you.  That's right.  I don't even humor idiots anymore.  I'm long gone as far as humor and idiots.  I used to try to reason with them and talk to them.  It's like, all right, I get it.  You need to just go away.  Look at you.  Goodbye.  Ah, you fucking hillbilly.  Shut up!  It would cost $62 more to make it in America, the iPhone, supposedly. 
[00:37:30]  Wow.  Per unit?  How much?  62?  62.  It's got to be more than that.  No, 62 more.  To make it.  Oh, yeah.  If they didn't go to China.  China.  That's a lot of money.  That shows me there's a problem there.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Our first problem is, like, treating every human being as equals.  That's right.  Yeah?  China got that shit down.  Cast system.  They realize, look, man, not everyone is, you know, a full human being. 
[00:38:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah, yeah, that whole capitalism slash communism thing they've worked out there  is really odd.  Talk about an upper echelon and a fucking scum of the earth.  Talk about an economic divide in China.  It's quite amazing.  Which is amazing, considering, uh, say, I want to say something that would really work, but  I got scared.  Oh, oh, why?  The Chinese?  Well, they all, uh, you know.  Oh, boy. 
[00:38:30]  Hold on.  Let me put my finger on the dump button.  It's, it's, hold on.  All right.  It's going to write down something here.  That's right.  It's, uh.  E-H-I.  Considering they all, uh.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that's.  It's so weird that they actually look and go, no.  No, not you.  We see that, no, we're not all.  But you.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's strange to me.  Well, it can be at times, let's just say.  It's like with both iPhones.  Yeah.  Like, when you look at one iPhone, it's kind of hard to tell it apart from another iPhone. 
[00:39:00]  Which one's my AT&T one and which one is my Verizon one?  Very difficult to tell.  See, very difficult.  There is a difference.  One is better than the other.  Yes.  Very hard to tell apart.  Yes.  Right.  Oh, but.  Very hard.  The new one, though, will be easier to tell.  Oh, yeah.  Are you going to get it?  Uh, you know, of course.  I'm that guy.  It's got the new iOS on it.  iOS 6.  Oh, it does?  Do you save your old iPhones?  Do you get rid of them?  Oh, God, Jimmy.  What are you doing? 
[00:39:30]  That drives me nuts.  I have them in boxes.  Oh.  Oh, why?  Yay.  Oh.  Because I'm sweet.  Because I'm sweet.  It's collector's items.  They're going to be collector's items.  Someday, yeah.  Yeah.  There's only been 30 million of them sold.  You're going to pawn it or sell it.  You know how freeing it would be to just throw that box away?  You'll never turn those old phones on again.  I want to skip it on a lake.  I keep thinking I want to use them as storage devices.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  You're right at this.  Why?  You could buy a fucking hard drive with a terabyte on it.  It's nothing.  I don't want a scary bite. 
[00:40:00]  Take us out, you farm animal.  No, we just got here.  You got to deal with union guys, man.  I'm sorry.  No, I understand.  I'm sorry.  But, you know, the union guys obviously aren't going to be pro-union.  Well, let's get Anthony on the line here.  Anthony.  Hey, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Hi, sir.  What's happening?  Listen, I think that management takes a pay cut instead of us getting beat up on the  labor end of it.  It'd be a little bit of a way to keep the cost down on making these phones here in the  United States.  That's true.  Management's not really taking big pay cuts, it seems. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, I hear you.  I hear you.  But, I mean, some of these jobs, these union jobs, I don't know.  Seems like a lot of money for something that overseas people are obviously going to get  for cheaper.  Crazy.  I agree.  I mean, you can't compete with union labor, though.  Oh, really?  Should I look for the union label when I am buying?  Absolutely.  All right.  While I talk to you on my Chinese cell phone.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:41:00]  And drive my Chinese car.  At least the car's American.  Oh, good.  With the phone and his cell phone.  God bless America.  All righty.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, Mr. You.  Take it easy.  All right, so it doesn't sound like the iPhone 5 was an amazing fucking reveal yesterday.  No, they do.  Not a bad reveal, don't get me wrong.  Yeah.  But I guess it can't be this wow moment every single time they announce a new product.  Yeah, that's just it.  It's become something where it's like, all right, you know, when they announced the initial 
[00:41:30]  iPhone, there wasn't one person watching that didn't go, holy motherfuck, this is changing  the entire phone industry.  They still had buttons.  Remember?  Phones with fucking buttons.  And then the iPhone came out.  Everybody was freaked out.  But now, as it goes along, I mean, we're on the fifth incarnation here.  I finally found a phone I'm really happy with.  This Samsung I love.  The S3 I love.  I love it.  Yeah, a lot of people are digging on the Galaxy.  Fucking love it.  I will not be buying an iPhone 5. 
[00:42:00]  As far as phones go, I mean, anything that came out before the Galaxy 3 like that was  just kind of like, all right, I see, it's an iPhone ripoff and stuff.  But that actually, they figured it out.  And it's a bigger phone, but I don't feel like, you know, it's cumbersome at all.  Are the apps, do they work as well as they do on the iPhone?  I don't know.  Because, I mean, my wife's got a, she's got a iPhone.  So, I play with it a little bit.  I like this just the same.  I'm sure, I'm sure the iPhone has more apps. 
[00:42:30]  I like the convenience of going to the app store and on the phone and just being able  to fucking download shit like that.  I've been able to download whatever I wanted.  Yeah, I understand.  As far as apps go.  But I'm not an app guy like you guys as much.  I hate learning a new iOS.  I got apps, but not as much as you guys.  iOS, yeah.  I hate learning a new operating system on a phone.  It's like, oh, God.  You're not learning anything.  You're just tapping.  Yeah.  Hey, your toes are still tapping.  You guys do Flipboard yet?  Huh, what?  No. 
[00:43:00]  Flipboard rules.  What the fuck is that?  Just flip through your shit.  Oh, look.  Oh, yeah.  You set up what you want to flip through.  Like, in my case, I get the Facebook, the Twitter.  I get the Flipboard pics, Photography, Sports News, Pop Culture.  And then you go, all right, I want to go popular video.  Let me see what's popular today.  And then you flip through like this until you see something you like.  And then you click and either view it or read about it.  Oh.  Interesting.  Does, uh, iPhone has an app for Flipboard, right? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, I'm sure.  I don't know what they have.  I don't know what they got.  Native Flipboard thing.  I like the Flipboard.  I like the maps now.  The 3D maps.  They killed all the native Google apps.  Yeah.  So even YouTube app is not native anymore.  I mean, there is.  What do you mean by native?  I'm not sure what you mean.  Like, how, uh, it used to come with Google Maps and YouTube built in, like, when you bought it.  Yeah.  Now they changed it so Maps is their own app.  They designed it themselves and it's not.  Apple?  Yeah, it's not Google Maps at all.  And YouTube doesn't come with the phone anymore. 
[00:44:00]  You have to go into the app store and get the new YouTube app.  So what's their version of their YouTube app?  They don't have one.  What's.  But you know they're probably going to figure something out, right?  Well, you just go to the app store and download it.  Oh, I gotcha.  Why is that?  So they want a little.  Because they don't want to be working with Google, obviously.  Okay.  Yeah, it's Google.  Yeah, they're kind of.  That's the Android operating system.  You're starting to see this encroachment of corporate war going on in this electronic medium.  Of course.  They won't say it, but.  Yeah, but that's exactly why they're doing it.  Wait, so.  They don't want to promote Google in any way. 
[00:44:30]  So iPhone doesn't have Google Maps?  They have their own version?  Yes.  And what is it called?  Maps.  It's Maps.  And it's a 3D kind of a thing.  Turn by turn.  Turn by turn, directions.  Yeah, it's pretty much a navigation system on your phone, which is pretty good.  Apple wants to take over the world, and so does Google.  Right.  Yeah.  Who wins?  Apple, I think.  Is this like a Betamax versus VHS shit thing?  Yeah.  Who wins?  Apple's going to look a lot prettier.  Or do they work together eventually?  A lot of fucking money. 
[00:45:00]  But I don't think it's Beta versus VHS.  I think it's more Exxon versus Mobile.  Two of kind of very similar things that are fine.  And one is not going to completely wipe out the other because it will become obsolete.  But one is just going to be more like higher on the ladder.  That's all.  I like that, how it lays down.  It's like Getty versus Sunoco.  The map kind of lays down and gets 3D.  Exxon versus BP.  It's pretty cool looking.  I got it, Jimmy.  That's it, huh?  I was thinking more Coke versus Pepsi. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, Coke versus Pepsi.  Go zoom in on that, Sam.  I want to see that.  That looks kind of cartoonish from here.  Yeah, but it's real.  Go to me and Jimmy's houses.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not just a screenshot.  See if you can look in the window.  He doesn't have it.  Check out my juicy cock.  It's just a screenshot.  Not the phone.  Well, why don't you zoom in on it, you fucking creep?  Not the phone.  Oh, because you can't use it yet.  It's not out yet?  This is not the phone.  Why can't we pre-order it?  Tomorrow.  Oh, good.  Tomorrow.  Oh, tomorrow.  Tomorrow you can pre-order it.  Yeah, good.  Yeah, and then it comes out on the, what, 21st? 
[00:46:00]  Something like that?  Yeah.  That is pretty good.  Wow, that's actually really good.  We got a guy.  Oh, no.  That needs to talk to us, right?  Oh, cool.  Let's get him on.  Frederico.  That's a nice guy.  Come on, Mr. Bimmel.  Am I on the show?  Frederico.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show starring Lil Jimmy Norton.  Dude, you know what?  You guys are the best.  Listen, I've been listening to you guys for like over five years.  Two times a second, man. 
[00:46:30]  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah?  And what's up, my friend?  My friend, like, seriously, like, I am holy lit.  I can't believe it, man.  Like, I'm just, like, astonished.  I'm sorry.  I'm just such a douchebag.  But anyways, I just wanted to tell you that, yeah, listen, by the way, this freaking, we're  all being apt, we're all being, like, 666, everything is being, like, underground, like, 
[00:47:00]  seriously.  Oh.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Yeah?  Well, we're just being chipped, Mike.  What's that?  We're all being slowly.  Oh, yeah.  What do you mean by apt, though?  Like, how does it affect you?  Well, we're going to be, like, underground.  And holy shit, I can't believe, like, we're being, yeah, we're going to be, like, like,  the government, everything, man.  Like, everything is going to be chipped.  I agree with him. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  The conspiracy terrorist.  Holy crap, that's good.  That was good.  This guy zoned it.  Douchebag.  No, you're not a douchebag.  I like what you have to say today.  Yeah, you're making sense, dude.  I think it needs to be said.  What part of Canada, sir?  Alberta.  Oh.  Where's that?  Calgary.  There's a way up there.  And that douchebag, yeah.  I love it.  It's called Cranoka.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  But the thing is.  Yeah.  Like, seriously, like.  Wow. 
[00:48:00]  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Seriously, boys.  Yeah.  We've got to be, you know, you guys are very commercial.  I think we've got to be diligent, don't you think, Rodrigo?  Diligence, yeah.  We need diligence, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Before it happened.  Dillinger.  Yeah.  Before it happened.  Double guns.  Yeah.  Made out of soap.  You're fucking nutty on a fruitcake.  What do you think?  You know what?  We have to. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  You're right.  You're right.  I think you're right about that.  Good point.  Good point, sir.  You made that point.  We're just reiterating the point you made, because I think you're onto something.  He is.  Go with it, sir.  What else about that?  Well, I just think that we need to be, just be very careful.  Uh-huh.  I don't know why you're laughing.  You're not wrong.  I think this is a conversation that needs to be said.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I like the idea. 
[00:49:00]  Sure.  Or had.  Okay.  I was talking properly.  No, I don't want to create the negative energy, but I think that we need to understand  that there is definitely a-  A divide?  Something going on.  Yep.  Pardon me?  A divide.  Oh, boy.  Why is that a good one?  A divide?  It's hilarious.  I don't see the humor in that.  That's funny.  There's an absolute divide happening.  It's funny.  I love it.  I can't believe I'm on the show. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, we can't believe it either.  You can't believe it.  You can't believe it.  You can't believe it.  You can't believe it.  You can't believe it.  You can't believe it.  You can't believe it.  Obviously calling it in today.  Okay.  The last thing I can say, like, you guys are awesome.  You guys, I love you guys, man.  Thank you.  Thanks for going on.  Thank you.  Frederico, you've been listening for five years.  Yes.  Can I ask you what, because I'm a little confused, what you like about the Opie and Anthony  show?  Oh.  Oh, what do I like? 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  I love Patrice.  That's a Patrice plug.  Was it Patrice?  I think so.  I'm a little slow on the switch.  You know, that's fine.  Patrice would understand.  Of course he would.  Yeah.  All right.  Time to eat my sandwich.  I want to get a Honey Boo Boo update.  Ugh.  Is Roland here yet?  Pig.  So worry about it.  Pig.  People enjoyed the Honey Boo Boo interview yesterday.  What movie was that?  What?  Remember that guy? 
[00:50:30]  No.  What are you going to do?  Pig.  Remember that guy?  I don't know, but it sounds like Ted Levine, unless it's just a...  I don't know who it was, but he was like spitting, and it was one of those cop things,  almost like a Dirty Harry kind of a thing.  Pig.  It's just this fucking...  Was it Cobra?  Cobra.  Was it Cobra?  Cobretty?  Yeah.  It's Cobra's coming in.  Pig.  All right. 
[00:51:00]  Cobretty.  Oh, Cobra.  It's Marion Cobretty.  That's terrible.  With the sunglasses and the fucking toothpick.  You're the disease.  I'm the cure.  If the disease is good dialogue, you are the cure for that.  What a cheesedick.  That was a horrible movie.  Cobretty, get in here!  What has he done this time?  Oh, it's crazy. 
[00:51:30]  Look out.  Look out.  I'll have your badge!  Why would he be allowed to be on the force if he's always fucking up?  Because he always gets it done.  But he gets it done his way!  Yes.  Now I understand.  Hey, well, you know, I'm just doing it my way.  Yeah.  Was that Ted Levine?  Do you like when a cop goes rogue?  Watch that.  No.  A cop goes rogue.  You're not a fan of when the cop goes rogue now?  He's a rogue cop.  He's doing it his way. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, God.  I don't play by the rules.  He don't play by the rules, but he gets the job done.  And it's always because of something that happened to him in the past.  Yeah.  Man, where he was following the rules and it went bad.  But his wife was murdered.  Yeah, a loved one got killed and he turned rogue.  And now he's taking it out on society.  Oh, God.  I'm rogue.  It's Kenny.  May I comment?  Sure.  The ends must justify the means. 
[00:52:30]  Completely ruining the energy of the day.  What the fuck?  Completely ruining the energy.  He's saying that in his world.  Right.  We had a rhythm going.  No, this is what Kenny...  No, no.  What you just saw there is what he says in the mirror every night before...  This is how he sleeps with himself.  If people want to know how does Kenny live the way he lives, that's at the end of the night.  Yeah.  Yes, I did this wrong thing to people and that wrong thing, but the end justifies the means.  The end justifies the means.  Because he was going to hurt somebody. 
[00:53:00]  No, it wasn't Ted Levine in Cobretti.  Was he in Cobretti?  No.  Cobra.  Marion Cobretti.  What a terrible fucking...  Lieutenant Marion Cobra Cobretti.  Oh, how embarrassing.  Of course he's a lieutenant.  Oh, yeah.  Because he just, you know, even though he shirks all the rules and he skirts them, he gets the job done.  Done.  Done.  You want a bad guy taken down, you send in Cobra.  He doesn't sweat.  He just walks around with his shades and he knows where to go and a point. 
[00:53:30]  What else does the road cop do?  I don't negotiate with...  What was it?  Scum or some dumb corn...  Dirt balls.  He said something.  It was terrible.  Cobra.  I don't negotiate with...  What else does the road cop do?  What was it?  Well, the road cop will actually get his badge taken away.  He only gets it back at the end begrudgingly.  Here you go, Cobra.  He always has a conflict when it comes to relationships.  He can't settle down.  And you know what?  Don't look for him in a fucking cop car.  He has his cool personal car that he uses. 
[00:54:00]  He's out in the room.  Yeah, look out.  Can we watch the trailer for this awful movie?  It's also a new kind of cop.  A new kind of cop.  Cobra.  He does the job nobody wants.  Does it his way.  Sunglasses are on.  Inside.  During a gunfight.  Takes a sip of the beer.  A sip of beer.  Right.  Of course, by the way. 
[00:54:30]  To use unnecessary deadly force.  I used everything I had.  Do you know you have an attitude problem?  Yeah, but it's just a little one.  Oh!  Watch out!  Recognize me if you saw him again.  The tall one?  Yeah.  The one that wants to kill you.  Do what you have to do to get a lead on this maniac.  Oh!  And if I find him?  Do what you do best.  Oh!  Shoot Stella.  Do what you do best. 
[00:55:00]  He's just throwing bombs into traffic.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  He's firing willy-nilly into crowds.  I hate the match in his mouth.  He's got the match set.  Stallone is...  Cobra.  The strong arm of the law.  Oh!  This is humiliating.  Oh, God!  This is terrible!  How embarrassing!  I like it.  He's rogue.  Oh, how terrible!  And...  Then do what you do best.  All right, I'll put on gloves and fight for the 40th time. 
[00:55:30]  Overact.  Poorly.  Say stupid things.  You're the disease.  I'm the gear.  Do what you do best.  Write cheesy dialogue.  He doesn't have a holster.  He just shoves the gun down the front of his pants.  Why?  Because he's the strong arm of the law.  Of course.  Cops always take a sip of the beer.  Yeah.  That's the way it works.  A beer with sunglasses on inside a supermarket as you're having a gunfight with a bad guy. 
[00:56:00]  And he shoots accurately.  I mean, that is the way it happens.  Well, he did have time to have a beer, too.  Let's not forget.  Do you know how much damage you did out there, Colt Brady?  As much as...  God damn it, Colt Brady!  Yeah.  As much as needed to be done.  Yeah.  As much as I needed.  Hey, I got those people out of there.  Hey, I'm hiding a hair lip.  Well, we know.  We know.  God bless.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Good luck to you.  Colt Brady likes women who shit on tabletops made of glass that he's sitting under. 
[00:56:30]  I like that.  Yeah, I like that a lot.  It's a fetish, but it keeps me relaxed in my topsy-turvy world.  Colt Brady likes a nice, firm shit.  You're the log, and I'm the toilet.  Just trying to catchphrases.  They don't work.  Just do what you do best.  Just do what you do best. 
[00:57:00]  Consume it.  Just turn into shit-eating.  Again.  Of course.  Shit-eating.  I like the concept of the rogue cop, though.  Watch out.  Yeah, look out.  Watch out.  He's a rogue cop, all right.  He finds that lady, that special lady, by the end.  Based on the novel Fair Game?  Oh, man.  That must have been a good one.  Based on a novel.  I wonder if it was as bad as Fair Game.  I wonder if in the thing he takes a swig of the beer and he might have cheese-dicked it up. 
[00:57:30]  I bet he cheese-dicked it up.  They made it for Stallone.  Cobra.  Cobra.  Lieutenant Cabretti.  Lieutenant Marion Cobra Cabretti is out on the streets.  The irony.  Turning up the scum.  The irony of giving him the name like Marion is amazing.  That's the irony of it, because he's such a man.  You've got to have a man's name.  Yeah, that was the irony of it.  It's like, what's your name?  Wasn't that a whole thing in the movie?  It's like, what's your real name?  And it finally came out, Marion, and they all start laughing at him. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  I've got a name like a faggot, but I sure as fuck do kick some ass.  Cobra.  I love how we could goof on a 30-year-old movie.  Hey, look.  How old is that movie, really?  Oh, man.  This is early 80s, right?  What the fuck year is that?  It's 96.  96.  I actually thought it was.  What year is that movie?  Come on now.  Bridget Nielsen looked good in that movie.  Brigitte.  Oh, 86.  86.  Bridget Nielsen looked really good.  Brigitte. 
[00:58:30]  Yes.  I think it was before she did the dykey haircut.  She did look good in that movie.  Fuck yeah.  Her hair was a little longer, I believe.  It's so hard to look at a hot chick back then when you know she looks like shit now.  Because you always kind of now see what turned to shit.  Yeah, look, though.  Dude, she was fucking hot.  She was fucking pretty hot.  Look at those bedroom eyes.  That dumb hat.  Sonia.  You know, with those fucking curly locks of the 80s.  But she had to cut it all off and look kind of...  Big hair.  Yeah.  Intimidating. 
[00:59:00]  You know, Cobra, I never thanked you for saving my life.  Hey, shut up there, you legless, nothing worthless fucking shrimp boater.  Hey, Cobra, this is my fat wife Susan.  Could you drink some beer and shoot her in the face?  Obesity is the disease.  The diet is the cure.  You know, Cobra, I never thanked you for doing such good catchphrases.  This is my friend Stupid and his wife Aidsie.  Aidsie is the disease.  There is no cure. 
[00:59:30]  Aidsie is the disease.  There is no cure.  A robe is no cure.  A puppy is the cure.  Cobra.  Could you shoot his Aidsie wife and we'll bury her under a tree, Cobra?  Could you do that?  Aidsie.  Aidsie.  That's so an Aidsie variety show. 
[01:00:00]  That's fucking A.  Let's eat.  Let's fucking eat.  We got Big Ange coming in today.  Really?  She's coming in?  They're all Big Ange.  That's that one from that show.  I don't watch the show, to be honest with you.  I don't either.  Mob Wives?  I guess we'll all learn about it.  Well, it started as Mob Wives, but now she's just...  She's her own thing.  She's got her own show.  Spin off Big Ange.  They will spin off a fucking reality show these days in a second.  Yeah.  Lickety split, Ant.  Amazing.  Lickety shit.  And Bob Kelly coming in to say hi today. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  Yeah, when's Bob in?  Where's Bobby?  So we'll go eat now.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Wasn't that written somewhere in some whore's book?  Yeah, we interviewed the whores from that book, and they claim, according to their book,  that Rocky was into watching girls crap on a glass table while he was under it.  Well, you know what's better than maybe laying underneath the table, you know?  And like watching a sphincter open up and just dump it out of me. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm out of your face.  I'm out of my face, Mickey.  Oh!  Oh!  Come on, baby.  Why don't you, you know, open it up and give me one over the glass table.  Oh, yeah, baby.  That's how I like it.  Sloppy.  I didn't start this.  You started this.  Yeah, give me some. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, look at that.  There's some corn in there.  What's that I see?  Oh, look.  I see some peanuts.  Mickey!  She ate peanuts, Mickey!  You know, when a girl squats over your table like that, you're hoping, you know, it's a nice sloppy dump.  You know, you don't want anything to do.  That's a good one.  Yeah, baby.  Oh, that's a little driver.  You know, I don't know where Adrian went. 
[01:02:00]  Adrian must have left the building.  But, hey, Pauly.  Pauly, get over here and squat on the table, Pauly.  Pauly, squat on the table.  Oh, Pauly, give it to me, Pauly.  Oh, Pauly. 
[01:02:30]  Big fat ass, Pauly.  Oh, oh.  Hey, Pauly, where are you going?  Now who's going to squat over the table?  Hell yeah.  Hey, Mickey.  Hey, Mickey, come on over here.  Squat on the table, Mickey.  Oh, Mickey, Mickey.  Oh, no, look, it's first blood. 
[01:03:00]  Mickey, you threw first blood.  Not me.  I didn't start this.  You started it.  Mickey.  Mickey, grab on the table, Mickey.  Rocky's full of crab now.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Great.  Okay, where's my check?  Oh, that's wonderful. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, that's wonderful. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, that's wonderful. 
[01:04:30]  I fucking love this song.  Even if you don't like rap, you got to like this song.  Tupac, 16 years ago. 
[01:05:00]  Wow.  He's only 25.  He'd only be 41.  He's been gone a long time, man.  Some say he's not gone.  He would be an OG.  And he's had a better career than most people since dying.  Oh, man.  Still puts out that bad.  How much shit have they put out since he died?  Probably more than before.  Wow.  Amazing.  You guys see the car chase yesterday?  Yeah.  Greatest car chase ever?  Some are saying.  That was a good one. 
[01:05:30]  It was anticlimactic as far as the takedown.  I didn't like the ending.  Yeah.  But in general, it was a good fucking car chase.  You know who has great car chases?  Cobra.  Cobra.  But this car chase, bank robbers, four of them in the car.  And they know they're in trouble.  So they start throwing the money out the car.  They were trying to get people to just run into the street to get the money.  And then that would fuck up the cops that are in hot pursuit. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  The whole gimmick was they were driving around the same neighborhood.  Because they weren't just being nice guys.  They're like, okay, what can we do?  We're fucked here.  Yeah.  Wait, we got this money.  We throw it out the window.  These people will run in the street to get the money.  And then the cops have to fucking stop because they're not going to run over civilians.  Yeah, they were driving around the same neighborhood and more and more people were collecting.  And I think that was their plan was to throw money out, get a bunch of people congregating  in one area, and then you keep throwing more money out and they start going into the streets. 
[01:06:30]  The problem with the car chase is that pesky helicopter.  Oh, dude.  How do you outrun the helicopter?  You can't.  You don't.  This other shit, you know, you might be able to figure out something.  But then even when you leave the car, you still got to worry about the dumb helicopter in the air.  Where can you go to avoid a mall parking lot like underground and then run into the mall?  Oh, a parking garage.  Yeah.  I would think a parking garage would be pretty good.  I don't know.  That's a tough one.  But at some point you got to leave. 
[01:07:00]  Helicopters just chilling out.  How scared are those guys?  Up in the air.  You just ditch the car in there and then go into the mall.  Yeah.  See, look.  They're just fucking making it rain.  Look at these guys running into the street.  The funniest thing I heard.  The funniest thing I heard, though, was the news was saying, look, it's illegal to use that money.  So if you did pick some up, you need to go and return that.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  And they're in the middle of fucking pretty much South L.A. 
[01:07:30]  It's really not the best of neighborhoods.  No.  And you think those motherfuckers are going to be like, yeah, I'd like to return this money.  Yeah, I got like a few thousand dollars.  I want to return it because it's illegal.  And they can't prove that these people knew it was stolen.  Right.  These people did nothing illegal because as far as they're concerned, someone just threw money out the window.  Do you know what?  There is supposed to be, you don't expect to find that much money on the street.  So you're supposed to assume that there's something illegal about it and return it. 
[01:08:00]  If they're caught passing those bills, they will be talked to.  People throwing it out the window.  So the guy threw it out the window.  I thought he was being generous.  And no one's going to check the serial numbers as you're paying for shit.  They'll check to see if the dollar is real.  Yeah.  Not the dollar, but if it's like a higher denomination.  That's a good car chase, though.  Went down yesterday, what, in the L.A. area?  Yeah.  Down there in South L.A.  And then a dumb truck got him in the end. 
[01:08:30]  They got behind a truck.  Yeah, they got behind a truck and he swerved.  I kind of root for the bank robber in these situations because it's so fucking cool.  Look at these guys.  You want one to get away.  They're just grabbing cash.  Right.  And you can see that these kids are running out to the car now.  They know where it is.  It's on every television station in Los Angeles.  And now you get kids running out of their house in downtown looking for a little cash.  Man, what a...  Now we're back live.  They just have been throwing the money out there. 
[01:09:00]  That's great.  We're back in that area of downtown and people know where they are.  And now, on top of the bank robbery, we have confirmed that there is a handgun involved  in this.  So we know, as the police officers say, they are armed, they are reckless, they are dangerous,  and they have led police up to a dozen cruisers on this high-speed chase at times of 110 miles  per hour for almost one solid hour.  Look at the people on the side looking for the money.  This is great.  The police tell us, Megan, that every time they throw cash out, they actually have GPS 
[01:09:30]  indicators inside the police car, and they push a button.  Every time they push money out, they push a button, and that is location of another crime  scene.  Oh, it's marking.  So every place they put money out, they go back and try to get the cash.  Good luck.  Try to gather all that cash, because a lot of it's done.  You see them throwing something else out back there?  We know there's two people in the car, Megan.  It looks to me like there could be three.  I mean, we know three people in the car.  Look at this shit. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, and look at the people running.  And these guys are like, come on, throw it in, throw it in.  Throw it in.  Throw it in, motherfucker.  Make it rain.  This is downtown Los Angeles, a very impoverished area.  And when you've got people throwing money out, you've got some people that badly want that  money.  It's a black Volvo.  You haven't lost the helicopter at all.  And again, we have reiterated this.  They ain't losing that helicopter.  They've gone over, and they've run the license plate.  So if this car's not stolen, they know who they're dealing with.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.  They will try to contact this guy.  He has a cell phone.  They'll try and contact his cell phone. 
[01:10:30]  Some of them pick up.  Some of them don't.  This is cool.  All of them are desperate, and some of them, as we talked about earlier, Megan, are three-strike  offenders.  Live shit.  Which means that they're going away for a very long time when they're caught.  These guys are being pursued very aggressively because they pose a very big danger.  Why aren't they just blocking a street?  Yeah, it is weird.  Megan, the cops didn't even have to put a spike strip down or bump him.  The guy in the silver truck blocked him off.  There was another car over there.  That was the end of it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, the streets were a little narrow. 
[01:11:00]  A lot of these cars were pulled over.  And then, yeah, he just pulled right in there.  Who's that guy?  Stop them.  Is that a guy trying to help out the cops?  Might be.  All the folks were clapping their hands, and we weren't sure whether they were clapping  because the police were apprehending the bad guys or because...  No, that's not why they were clapping.  No, they're not.  You dumb bitch.  In downtown LA.  Look where you are.  South Central.  They're applauding the police efforts.  Yeah, the police.  Yeah, of course they are.  Yeah, good job.  Arrest those motherfuckers that were throwing money out the window.  Shut up, lady.  Aren't they just dumb? 
[01:11:30]  They're just dumb.  Oh, God.  We all know what they're applauding.  Of course.  It's obvious what they're applauding.  Oh.  These guys made it rain for the locals before they got caught.  I guess that's a do-gooder that pulled in front of the bank robbers.  Who's that?  That doesn't look like a do-gooder.  That's a fucking big, like, souped-up truck.  Might have been an off-duty guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe.  Might have been Cobretti.  Cobretti.  Yeah.  Yeah, Cobretti is his own vehicle.  So you don't drive no cop car.  Yeah.  I'll block it for you.  I'll unblock it.  I'll go back and get the money. 
[01:12:00]  Wow.  There's a lot.  Oh, they came out.  That could have been a situation, man.  Look at that.  There's hundreds of people.  They had to secure that vehicle really quickly because a crowd of people started getting  around it, and you saw some people looking in the window because they got to assume that  there's still a shitload of money in the vehicle.  So they started like zombies walking over to the vehicle, and after about five minutes,  a lot of cops in riot gear came out and started blocking off certain streets and trying to 
[01:12:30]  move the crowd along.  That's a good car chase.  One of the better ones.  I would like to know something, though.  Yeah.  That was, what, 11-something L.A. time?  Yeah.  Why were all those people able to just walk out on the streets at that hour?  Shouldn't there maybe be work?  Well, it may have been lunch hour.  No, it wasn't.  It may have been...  Those are people that don't work.  They were the burdens on society. 
[01:13:00]  I think it was 10 o'clock our time, though.  Wasn't it?  No, it was like one-something.  I felt like people were tweeting me early right after the show yesterday about this one.  It was early.  It was in the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, this guy...  Wow.  I don't know if he wants to admit this.  Maybe he's already done the fucking time.  Fuck it.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Mike?  Yeah.  Hey, I had a boy who, when I was living in Florida...  Lucky you!  Yo, no, these dummies tried robbing, like, a teller at, you know, through the drive-thru of 
[01:13:30]  a bank when, uh, they were being chased, pursued by the police, and my man, like, made it out  to, like, the Everglade area, you know, tried doing, like, the Predator, and was, like,  covering himself in mud because the helicopter, you know, had that infrared on it.  Oh, yeah, that ain't gonna work.  Yeah, no, it kind of did work because they lost one, but his fat ass got found by a dog.  Wait, so you know a guy, a friend of yours?  Yeah, yeah, the big Mexican dude.  He was, like, almost 300 pounds.  They tried, they were, like, fucked up. 
[01:14:00]  Hold on, hold on.  I'm slowing you down.  So he robs a bank?  No, no, not a bank.  These dummies were trying to break into, like, the ATM and the drive-thru.  Okay, gotcha.  So then they had the helicopter on the guy, he made it to the Everglades in a car?  Yeah, they were close by, like, the Everglades.  They got out running, and the helicopter was above them.  And this dummy, like, you know, jumped on the side of, like, the bank of the canal  and was covering himself with, like, all the mud.  And apparently it must have started working because the helicopter was, like, off in the distance. 
[01:14:30]  He thought he got away, but the canine found his ass.  It was, like, biting him up and shit.  That's pretty smart, actually.  Yeah, I know.  It's tough to fucking get away from those helicopters.  Yeah, that's at least a smart solution.  Yeah, I don't even know what you would do in that situation.  He almost did it.  I mean, you know, they said that, according to him, he was, like, not, they didn't find  him for, like, 25 minutes, you know, almost a half hour before, like, the dog got his ass.  Not bad.  Dog got his ass.  That'd be a cool reality show.  Dog got his ass.  Trying to get away from the helicopter.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  That's pretty good, but they didn't get nothing either.  They were all just doped up and thought they were going to get some quick money.  Yeah.  That's a crime I understand, though.  Like, guys breaking into an ATM, that makes sense.  Yeah.  Of course I know why you do it.  It's where the money is.  Yeah.  It's where the money is.  It's not hurting anybody.  It was actually an off-duty cop that was driving by in the road, in, like, Lake Worth Road,  and, like, happened to see them all around it and called it in.  So I waited for the backup, and by then, the helicopter showed up beforehand. 
[01:15:30]  You know, they got about, like, two blocks away by a shopping center before they knew they  weren't going to get nowhere in the car.  So they just all bailed out and just...  All right.  That's just bad luck.  Yeah.  But him being 300 pounds, it's like, you know, everyone else was out.  He was...  That's why they were focusing on him.  Big fat ass.  Pretty amazing.  Getting eaten by the police.  Good story, sir.  Thank you.  All right?  Thank you!  Mikey in Jersey. 
[01:16:00]  So, uh, what?  We're going to spank Libya pretty good?  Uh, I don't know what's going on.  Uh, there's a few warships headed that way.  Yeah, they're going to fucking spank them pretty good, I think.  This is a weird situation, man.  I was reading the paper, they're like, let's spank them, and then get the fuck out of there.  Let's fucking make our point and get the fuck out of there.  But now, but the thing is, like, all right, who did it?  Libyan government didn't have anything to do with it.  There is no government there.  Was it just a roving band of thugs? 
[01:16:30]  Or was it a well-organized terrorist strike on November, uh, September 11th, the 11th anniversary?  It happened in fucking Egypt, too.  Yeah, yeah, Egypt, too.  They did the same thing.  And now, I guess, riots are spreading to Yemen, Egypt, and Tunisia.  Um, what are we doing over there?  Why do we help these shitty countries?  We're giving them billions of dollars, too.  Billions of dollars.  In their rebellion?  I mean, I don't think...  This is why I'm glad we didn't help in Syria. 
[01:17:00]  I want no U.S. intervention in Syria.  Like, I don't give a fuck what he does to the...  And I know that they're supporters of terrorism, and he's a piece of shit.  Yeah.  This is what happens when you just...  We don't interfere, and you let them just slaughter his people.  In Egypt, they pulled it off.  We backed them up in Libya like dummies.  Right.  Um, and I guess Qaddafi was kind of a cocksucker for Pan Am.  We had to kill him, but...  Yeah, Qaddafi, but I mean...  Well, they did.  As far as...  He kind of had it coming.  As far as Mubarak goes, like, who gave a shit if he was in there fucking, uh, destroying 
[01:17:30]  his people?  And then they have this Arab Spring.  Everybody's like, finally, democracy's gonna come to Egypt, and it's gonna be great because  there's no more dictator, like, Mubarak is out, and...  And then it just turns into this fucking Islamic fundamentalist government that hates us, hates  America, wants us dead, and is proving it.  But I'm proving how much they had it.  As we shovel just billions of dollars. 
[01:18:00]  We deserve what we get over there.  Yes.  We don't belong there.  Fucking stop giving them money.  Yeah.  If Israel has a problem with them, Israel is perfectly capable of handling anybody themselves.  Yeah.  We do not belong...  Get our fucking troops and bases out.  Leave.  I don't want to be there.  I don't care if they're being...  If they're flourishing, good.  Yeah.  If they're being slaughtered by their own fuck...  Good.  It's not my business.  Not our problem.  Four Americans killed, um, in the embassy. 
[01:18:30]  Now, this also is a little odd.  What...  How do you have an American embassy in Libya, which is not known as the most stable of fucking  places, even after Gaddafi's gone?  I mean, there's really no working government there.  No.  How do you have an embassy with American personnel in there, and really no American guards?  They were being guarded by these Libyans.  Yep.  Uh, how did that happen? 
[01:19:00]  How do you not have some Marines there, uh, guarding that embassy?  I don't get it.  It seems to me like, uh, like they, they left those poor guys with their asses hanging out.  I guess it worked for many, many years.  No, you know what it is?  A lot of times, people don't want to offend, we can't have our Marines there, and stuff,  uh, why?  Because it's Islamic?  I am so sick of Islam. 
[01:19:30]  I think everybody is fed up with it.  I'm very fucking tired.  I was having quite the Twitter argument last night with people.  When you look at the amount, I'm not saying all Muslims are terrorists, but I am saying  most terrorists are Muslim, and there seems to be a problem there that isn't being addressed.  I'm so tired of these motherfuckers that we are supporting, uh, uh, ripping up the American  flag, which, you know, gives a shit about a piece of material, but the symbolism behind 
[01:20:00]  it, they hate us.  Just stop giving them money.  Stop giving shitty, uh, countries money.  Let them do what they want to do.  If they want to elect the Muslim Brotherhood, let them.  If, if, if the people of Afghanistan do not want to rise up themselves and wipe out the  Taliban, too bad.  Whatever.  Let them be, let their women be de-clitted in the street.  It's not my fucking problem.  We, we give a lot of money to Egypt so they leave, uh, Israel alone, right?  Is that the whole thing over there?  I don't know exactly.  I know we were giving money to, I want to say Lebanon or, or Pakistan to help fund their children's 
[01:20:30]  morning shows.  I guess so the Western ideology is put in there, but I don't want Western ideology put  in there.  Let them live however they want to live.  All embassies are protected by Marines, are guarded by Marines.  Well, apparently not that one.  Uh, I didn't hear.  You know that for sure?  I didn't hear anything.  There wasn't an inkling in the story about any Marines, uh, being at that embassy or engaging,  um, any of the people.  They had private security. 
[01:21:00]  Who accepts that gig?  I mean, like, as a, as an ambassador or a guy working for him?  Yeah.  So, hoping you're going to France or Italy?  Like, no, no.  Libya.  Libya.  So, Mike, the Marine, I know you would know, but, uh, who, I mean, where, where were the  Marines?  Where were they?  Huh?  Huh?  Tell me.  Mike, call the show, please.  Yeah.  Uh, so what happens?  We're going to spank Libya?  What are we going to do? 
[01:21:30]  Uh.  He's sending warships with Predator drones.  Predator drones are flying over.  Obama's got to do something.  He's got to look.  He will.  He's got to look strong.  Yeah.  We've got an election coming up.  People want something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People want something.  People want something done.  And then, uh, boy, I was switching between Fox and MSNBC last night.  Yeah.  And, uh, you would swear that it was two completely different stories going on with this, uh,  embassy attack.  Um, Fox had it, uh, pretty much concentrating on the fact that, um, there was this, they wanted 
[01:22:00]  to call it an apology, but even I am saying it wasn't an apology by Obama.  It was an acknowledgement that the United States does not stand for people's, uh, the denigration  of people's religious beliefs.  Right.  Uh, that was the first part of his statement.  And then he talked about, uh, there's no excuse for this killing and people with justice  will be served.  Uh, but prefacing it with the fact that we will not stand for the denigration of a religion. 
[01:22:30]  If, if the, what's supposed to have caused this is this trailer for a movie that, uh,  is, is not very flattering to Islam.  Uh, they, they go off, they have a history of fucking killing people that have spoken  ill about, uh, Islam.  Um, uh, that seems to be what at least the diversion was because the saying now it was  a calculated attack and this whole movie thing was just a diversion to bask that it was a  real attack.  But what Obama then addressed was, um, that, that they won't stand for the denigration of, 
[01:23:00]  of, uh, a religion, but that's freedom of speech.  What he should have, what he should have concentrated on was freedom of speech.  Right.  But again, when dealing with that savage mentality.  Yes.  Again, when people are going to try to put the fire out and any group that will throw rocks  at their own women, you have to speak to a certain way.  If you throw rocks at your own daughter, we got a certain way.  Good job.  Yes, here's a bigger rock. 
[01:23:30]  But it's like the, yeah, they, the people are killing Romney too.  They're saying he should have just kept his mouth shut.  Right.  Now that's the part that I saw on MSNBC.  You turn over there.  They weren't talking about anything, but Romney speaking, uh, as they said, out of, out of  turn, out of place, um, uh, a little premature.  He might've, uh, started yapping, but they were talking about that.  That would be the huge story on all the papers today would be, um, the fact that Romney spoke 
[01:24:00]  up and I know, sorry, I don't see it.  Uh, what I did see was both sides of the story being covered on CNN and Fox, MSNBC, I saw  Reverend Al and all he was doing was taking the opportunity to lambast Romney, uh, doing  exactly what he said Romney was doing, politicizing it.  And all Reverend Al was doing was politicizing it the other way. 
[01:24:30]  So, uh, they're just, I gotta say they are scumbags over at MSNBC.  They're terrible.  I understand Fox is, as a conservative, uh, right wing, uh, Republican bias.  Yes, I know.  And CNN, uh, liberal and NBC liberal, CBS liberal.  Uh, but MSNBC is so fucking far to the left.  It's embarrassing.  They're terrible.  It's fucking embarrassing.  When I watch Hannity or, um, uh, any of the, the afternoon news shows, I see a pretty good 
[01:25:00]  mix of, uh, liberal ideology and conservative.  A lot of the debates that you see on Megyn Kelly show, she has, all right, here's two guys.  Here's a former fucking Clinton, uh, speech writer, and here's a former Bush advisor, and  they'll go at each other.  I've never seen a conservative go on MSNBC and be treated, uh, like, like a human being.  That's if you see him at all.  Right.  It's a horribly slanted, tilted fucking network that deserves their no ratings. 
[01:25:30]  I even, like, I'll say that about Romney piping up.  He, I, I have more faith in Obama in this situation than I would in Romney.  I absolutely, I'm not saying Romney wouldn't have good advisors, but I have more faith because  he's proven himself that he's, he doesn't tolerate a lot of fucking bullshit.  Uh, he's much tougher than I thought he'd be over there, so let's see what he does.  Why the fuck were these guys left with their asses hanging out in the first place? 
[01:26:00]  Hold on, we got, why the fuck?  Man, we got, we got Mike the Marine.  All right.  Who's saying that Marines were there.  Mike!  We told him to call.  Mikey!  What happened?  Well, all right, I just wanted to, you know, basically, you know, not say that you're wrong,  but, yeah, Marines guard the embassies.  It's actually a unit called MSG, Marine Security Guard.  It's got all my Chinese food.  Makes me bloat, it bloats me.  Gives me headaches.  That's a great place for concerts.  Ah!  Hey!  Oh, shit.  So, where were the Marines at this, uh, Libyan embassy?  Where were, I don't know where exactly they were. 
[01:26:30]  Now, when Marines guard the, uh, guard the embassies, it's not like a battalion size.  Right.  Group of Marines.  It's a small contingent.  Dude, I, I, I know about this.  That's why I'm wondering why haven't we heard anything about Marines.  Um, and we absolutely would have heard.  If Marines had to engage, uh, people, we would have heard about that.  These seem to be, uh, four, um, international workers that, uh, our embassy staff that were,  that were killed.  I didn't hear anything about Marines. 
[01:27:00]  Well, let's put it this way.  If I was riding in a car with Jimmy and we got into a car accident and we both died, would I make the front page?  Yeah, believe me.  If you had a dress on, you would.  If, if that embassy is being, uh, is under siege by RPGs and, and, uh, small arms fire and there were Marines in that building,  you would abso-fucking-lutely hear that Marines were engaged in some type of, uh, uh, shootout. 
[01:27:30]  You would hear that.  I have not heard anything about Marines being involved in any way, shape, or form at this embassy.  Why the fuck weren't there, uh, armed personnel at this embassy?  That I don't know.  They should have been.  There should have been.  That's what I'm saying.  Maybe for whatever reason they felt like they just didn't need that at that particular embassy.  That's just it.  No, I'm just asking.  The other side of this.  But bingo.  That's what I'm saying.  That's a bad fucking call right there.  Well, obviously it turns out to be a bad call.  Why the fuck were these guys left like that?  Yeah.  But are, are the, are the other embassies like this? 
[01:28:00]  I don't know, but I bet they fucking buck up security now.  It's on TV right now.  Hold on a second.  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Go to Israel and then tell the world, well, we told them not to attack Iran.  What we need is Israel and the United States to be totally interlocked to present the United Front.  Yeah, that's about the, uh, Israel, Israeli situation.  Obama doesn't really want to talk to him.  Um, yeah, but it seems to me, look, I'm not saying blame Obama, blame Obama here.  Who, I'm saying who is the person that was supposed to have guarded these people? 
[01:28:30]  Why haven't, why weren't, why weren't people in place to guard?  That's, uh, supposedly sovereign American soil on these embassies that was attacked with impunity.  That, well, I say, I'll say this, that that's a, that's probably much more of a military, that's a much more of a military decision than, uh, he probably, he probably didn't even know it.  Oh, you mean like killing Osama bin Laden?  Um.  Much more of a military, uh.  Guarding an embassy, there's, there's less emphasis, there's, a president is less likely to be involved with guarding an individual embassy. 
[01:29:00]  We have embassies in, what, a hundred countries.  Yeah, but there's a policy.  There should be a policy in place that says every embassy, especially in these unstable places, our personnel need to be protected.  Well, maybe there is.  Someone dropped the fucking ball on this.  Yes, yes.  And now sending him warships, that's great.  But how about you do something, uh, beforehand?  Right.  Protect these poor motherfuckers. 
[01:29:30]  These guys were fucked.  You know how fucking petrified they must have been?  Yeah.  A group of savages out in front.  Just an awful country.  But again, and people got mad at me when I Twittered about how there's something to be said for a dictator.  Later, these guys, you know what, Assad knows how to deal with the mentality in Syria.  Oh, yeah.  He knows how to deal with it.  Pete knows a little more about this, too.  Oh, thank God.  Hi, Pete.  And Brooklyn, stay on the line.  Mike the Marine. 
[01:30:00]  Pete, what do you got?  Let's go.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  There's been an article in the Daily News.  I know it's not the greatest source in the world, but, uh, they were saying, uh, out of the four people killed, two of them were Marines.  Ant, comment.  I haven't heard that.  I have not heard that.  Dr. Steve is saying maybe it's the fact that it was a consulate, not an embassy, but still, in Libya, for God's sake, you'd think there'd be security.  No, I didn't hear anything about Marines being killed.  And I think we would have heard if Marines were, if military, American military personnel, not any better or worse than American civilians being killed. 
[01:30:30]  Uh, but it's, okay, scroll down.  Despite, scroll down, I'll leave it right there, Sam.  Despite threats, no Marines guarded U.S. consulate in Libya.  That's what the headline is that I'm reading right here.  Hold on, we got another guy.  Paul in Connecticut.  Paul, what do you know?  What do you know, Paul?  I work on a security desk, and basically the information we got yesterday was, number one, the Libyans were out.  There was a first line of Libyan defense force. 
[01:31:00]  They had no weapons, and they ran.  Libyans!  The second line of defense was private security that the State Department hires, plus Marines were in a five-hour gun battle with these guys.  The four people died of smoke inhalation from the fire that was started.  So no one breached the walls, and that's why they're saying it's an organized terrorist attack, because they had RPGs and automatic weapons.  It was a running gun battle for a long time, and really the only reason these guys died was because of smoke.  But I didn't hear that. 
[01:31:30]  I did not fucking hear that.  People say the two Marines died in this assault.  I work at a commodities desk, and we have oil companies there.  This information came from our guys, because that's where now it's about money.  It's not about anybody's life.  It's just about money.  But they said the guy, the diplomat, was suffocated, and they have his body.  So how do they not breach the wall if they have his body?  They don't have his body at all.  The body was taken from the embassy to a Libyan hospital to be resuscitated.  Oh, I thought that, you know, I'm sorry. 
[01:32:00]  It's my fault.  I thought that was a mob scene.  They don't show faces.  No, he was transported by an ambulance to be resuscitated.  There was no, you know, and then if you go on to the BBC, you can talk to the, uh, one of the attending physicians is there.  And he talks about there was no marks on his body.  There was no other trauma.  It was strictly suffocation.  We call it smoke inhalation.  They call it suffocation.  Yeah, they're calling it that for, to me, to make the story seem...  They were trapped in a fucking room.  Yeah, I'm not saying that it's a good death, but smoke inhalation sounds like a less menacing death than suffocation. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So thank you for clearing that up.  Mussolini, the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  And the information we're getting, too, is that he was in there.  He really didn't have to be there.  He was in there, and there's questions about whether he was destroying documents, why he was there.  Because he came from the outside in.  He was not on campus.  He came back in when the protesters showed up.  Now, where were they in the...  What kind of room were they in that the smoke was so bad? 
[01:33:00]  I don't have a way out of the thing, but they were inside the building.  The building went up like a match.  If you look at those pictures, everything burned.  So these guys came in RPGs, and, you know, I don't know what the interior was like,  but I don't know if this was a building that they took over, or we built it.  That's the other question.  Who built the building?  Because this thing, if you look at the pictures today, this thing is gutted.  Okay, but they never breached the wall.  They never got inside.  They did.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  And it was Marines, and then the embassies used... 
[01:33:30]  I didn't hear anything about Marines.  I'm still not fucking buying the Marine angle, sir.  A few people saying two were killed.  Marines guard embassies, Ant.  I'm not...  Every Marine contingent.  There's Marines in every embassy in the wall.  Until I see the names of the people and their fucking...  What they are, I'm still holding...  I'm holding back what I am willing to believe here.  I want to know who died in this embassy.  I heard four people.  I did not hear anything about Marines. 
[01:34:00]  They're all State Department employees, but you're not going to get...  The spin right now is Libyan's bad, American's good.  They're not going to sit there and say,  Oh, the Marines killed 15 before...  That part of the story is not going to come out for a while.  I didn't hear anything about any of the protesters being killed either, sir.  I didn't hear anything about that.  No fucking way.  Well, we look at MSNBC is concentrating on...  Exactly.  It's not surprising you didn't hear it.  Or Fox and them are concentrating on their nonsense.  All right.  You can run BBC in the background.  You'll get some more information on BBC.  Thank you, buddy. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  Very much.  All right.  CBS is reporting...  Let me see.  This is from Adam in London.  London.  That Ambassador Stevens suffocated death while two Marines and an embassy staffer were shot to death?  Is that what...  Is that it?  I mean, it's just Adam texting it, but...  Do you have something there, Sam?  Young Sam?  I got a link to a CBS article saying two Marines were killed.  Yeah, I've read security personnel. 
[01:35:00]  Security personnel?  Hey, uh...  Wow.  That's fucked.  Maybe Marines guard it, but maybe the U.S. doesn't make it a public...  Maybe they don't state it publicly, but it's just...  That's the security they're talking about?  Who knows?  Man.  Why don't we go to Tom?  Tom, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Tom.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes.  How can you defend Obama's foreign policy when the first thing he was doing was apologizing for Bush? 
[01:35:30]  And now, look what's going on in the world.  I'm not saying he's...  Hold on.  I'm not saying he's handled...  They've burned effigies of him.  They've always...  They did that with Bush.  They did it with Reagan.  They do it with every Western...  It's what they do.  They burn effigies.  I understand that.  But he was supposed to be, you know...  Well, can I answer your question?  He was supposed to bring everybody together.  And has he?  You said, how do I defend Obama's foreign policy? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  The part of it that I like is that he has been harsher on the Middle East than I expected  him to be.  He's been harsher on Israel.  He's been harsher on the Middle East.  Yeah, he has been harsher on Israel.  But he's been harsher on Islamic terrorism than I thought he would be.  And you know what?  When I'm dealing with this country, I'm tired of every other country being lumped in.  Israel can...  I'm very supportive of Israel.  They can handle themselves.  I don't expect our... 
[01:36:30]  Hold on.  Our foreign policy doesn't have to be dictated because Israel is having problems.  They don't need us.  They don't need our permission.  And we don't need to tell them what to do.  Right now, we're dictating Israeli policy, to tell you the truth, because they absolutely  want to do something to Iran.  They want to do something about their nuclear capability.  And we're pretty much the ones telling them, no, you've got to hold off.  They want to do it like yesterday.  But I think...  Well, is it so much that they want us to dictate it, or do they want somebody to have their 
[01:37:00]  back?  Maybe.  They don't want to be left in the wind.  Well, yeah.  Maybe, but they have to make that decision.  But you would hope your allies are going to be there if you're going to pull a huge  military move, like maybe bombing some of these nuclear sites.  And do you think Obama's going to have Netanyahu back?  No.  No, and I don't know if I want him to.  As much as I...  I want him to.  No.  I'm tired of being mixed up in that fucking mess over there.  I'm tired of the U.S. being mixed up in that mess.  I'm sick of it. 
[01:37:30]  It's not our fucking business.  All we do is put our dumb red, white, and blue fucking noses in everybody's ass.  Enough.  Can we just mind our fucking business?  What happens the next time they slide a plane into our buildings?  You don't do anything?  No, but that's our business, dummy.  If it's our building, it's our business.  Where do you...  Where are these people coming from?  They're coming from the...  Saudi Arabia, most of them.  So, what do you do? 
[01:38:00]  Cut ties with Saudi Arabia.  Drill in Alaska.  Cut ties...  And work on alternative...  I would do with that.  Work on alternative energy.  And cut ties with fucking Saudi Arabia.  Fuck the House of Saad.  Let them fall.  Let fucking Kuwait fall.  It's not our problem.  That's not an easy fix, though.  That would take years.  It would.  To separate from those guys.  But I'm tired of everything...  We are well connected to them.  I'm just tired of it.  I'm sick of us being mixed up in that shit.  We're in a tough spot, because you can't just say goodbye to Saudi Arabia anytime soon. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, I know, but it would take years.  Yeah.  But I'm just sick of it.  You'd be self-sufficient from that situation.  All right, guys.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, Tom.  Thank you.  There you go.  So, warships on the way.  Something will be done.  Warships on the way.  Yeah, something just going on.  Lob some shit and get out of there, maybe?  Where do you lob it?  I don't know.  It's just it.  These are weird mob-like things, and again, if Al-Qaeda was involved in some way, shape, 
[01:39:00]  or form, and it was more of a calculated attack, what do you do?  You lob fucking shit in on who?  That's why a lot of this shit happens, and there's just nobody to really concentrate your  anger and aggression on.  Well, Obama's got to handle this one properly.  We'll see what he ends up doing.  This is a very big test for him, especially so close to an election, how he handles this.  And believe me, just as Romney was politicizing it, both sides are absolutely looking at this 
[01:39:30]  situation, and whether they do the best thing for the country in this situation, or the best  thing to help their chance at being elected, and I'm talking about both sides here.  That'll show who more of the true patriot is here, because if you don't think President  Obama is basing his decisions on what is going to help him in November, you're a fucking idiot. 
[01:40:00]  If you think he's just such an American that he will only do what is best for the country  and not what might make him look a little better for re-election, you've got to be a  moron.  Yeah, I think most people know that.  No, I don't think so, Ope.  I think most people that listen to our show know that, I guess.  Well, maybe.  Yeah.  I think there's a lot of people that absolutely think, no, he'd put that aside.  Put that aside on like his Vegas fundraiser?  Oh, that's right.  He went to Vegas.  There's not a president alive that would put that shit aside. 
[01:40:30]  No, of course not.  They would politicize it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So is Romney guilty of this too, and you're still electing him?  He's guilty of politicizing it.  Of course he is.  Of course he is.  But no more than the other side is.  So shut the fuck up.  There, I'm admitting it.  Wow, look at me.  Good for you.  What are you admitting?  And Romney isn't the president. 
[01:41:00]  So there you go.  All right.  We'll break here.  We got the big Ang coming in at 9.30.  Oh, boy.  And the big ass coming in at 8.  And the big ass is up next, Bob Kelly.  How's he doing?  We'll find out, I guess.  He's sick.  What do you mean?  I just wanted to stop the show.  He's fine.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM. 
[01:41:30]  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Yeah.  What's that?  But can we interview you for Chippa TV?  It's talking to people at Comic Cons.  What's your hat supposed to be?  Supposed to be the mushroom hat for Toad.  The mushroom?  Uh-oh.  Like magic mushrooms?  Like you're going to get zooted or something?  Yeah, or magic brownies, right?  I got so fucked up one time.  I was smoking reefers and doing Mary Janes and whatnot.  And my friend's like, you want to do mushrooms? 
[01:42:00]  I'm like, fuck that shit.  No, it's just at that point, you're just like, no, maybe later.  Yeah, I get too zooted.  I just get fucking crazy, you know?  Fucking throw shit at the cops and whatnot.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Makes sense, yeah.  So, how's your Comic Con?  So far, so good.  I'm trying to meet girls, make friends.  Where's your boyfriend?  I don't have a boyfriend.  Oh, that's nice.  You want to go out for some pea soup or something?  I got to go meet up with my cousin.  She's an artist.  What the fuck?  She's an artist here.  Damn it. 
[01:42:30]  Where are you from?  I live in France.  Oh, what brings you here from France?  Oh my God, look at that guy's bulge.  That's the biggest pecker I ever seen.  I like you.  Where's your boyfriend?  Oh, he's walking around here somewhere.  Shit.  I got to go before he gets mad.  I thought I was going to get that, too.  God damn it.  I can't get no puss here.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Yeah.  Fucking home run, Chipperson.  I want to say hi to Bob Kelly. 
[01:43:00]  I haven't seen him in a while.  What's up?  Last couple times you were in here, I wasn't around.  Bobby.  Yeah.  Bob is here promoting the Irvine Improv tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Bob is here strictly to promote my game.  No, no, no, no.  Ouch.  Thank you, Bob.  I'm here to promote Levity Live this Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 
[01:43:30]  That means tonight.  Brand new club.  Yeah, I went there for a brewer's show.  Was it good?  It's a cool place.  Is it?  Nice.  Nice.  All brand new and the seats.  Kind of, I don't know, like almost a theater feel.  No shit.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  Everyone has a good view.  Really?  Yes.  How big is it?  I don't know.  Like 50 people?  7,000.  Between 50 and 7,000 people. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, between 50 and 7,000 people.  Hey, man, why aren't we going fucking fly fishing?  Let's get that out on the table.  October.  Are you going?  October.  Dumb little boat.  Did you see my boat?  I saw your boat.  Dingy.  It's called the Sea Eagle, by the way.  The Sea Eagle.  You got a Sea Eagle?  It's the Sea Eagle.  You got a fly fishing boat, or is it for all types of fishing?  You can do all types of fishing.  Let me look at the Sea Eagle.  Sea Eagle pontoon.  Oh, that's the kind of boat.  Wait.  Get the exact boat. 
[01:44:30]  You got one of those?  That's it right there.  Right there, yeah.  I don't see a seat for me, Bob Kelly.  That's a one-seater.  It's a one-seater, but you get your own.  They're very cheap.  Oh, you play bumper boats.  That'd be fun.  But I like when we're on the seat.  Oh, man.  He looks like he's ready to fall.  You can see that he's ready to fall.  That's because he's got a 10-pounder on the line.  Look at that.  Dude, no way.  He's using all his balance to make sure he doesn't fall in the river.  He was really trying not to fall.  That was a bad commercial for the Sea Eagle.  Oh, I like this.  The Sea Eagle is unbelievable.  You bring your kid out, you go fishing. 
[01:45:00]  It's a Cadillac of fly fishing boats.  Cadillacs of fly fishing boats.  You've got to blow it up.  You blow it up in a little, honest to God, two and a half minutes.  With a pump.  Oh.  You blow it up.  Oh, it's an air mattress for the water.  That's great.  The whole thing.  You don't blow it up with your mouth.  I have the swivel seat that Norton broke the first day I got it.  What?  I didn't mean to.  No, I didn't.  What, did you swivel?  Snapped off.  There's a little.  It folds up.  You can take everything.  It's like a horrible boat.  It's the best boat ever.  If Jim Norton is breaking it, they won't.  I didn't mean to.  He handed me something.  I didn't know how to carry it.  Sorry, I don't have a fucking Sea Eagle pontoon boat. 
[01:45:30]  I love you get angry like your parents are yelling at you.  I didn't mean to.  That boat looks horrible.  It's the best thing.  It really does look horrible.  It is the best way to fish.  I know.  Ever.  It's the number one boat out there for fly fishing.  First of all, I don't see a seat for myself.  First of all, I got you, your own lad.  How are we going to socialize with a one-seater?  I got you your own.  I'm going to have to yell, hey, how you doing over there?  You don't yell what would fly.  You know better.  He says it's the best birthday present I ever got.  Yeah, it is. 
[01:46:00]  Look at his tempo.  Wait, how did Jimmy break the boat?  It was in your house?  Yeah, what happened?  Everything comes off.  Ah, that's horrible.  And you got to assemble it when you're there.  I hate your smile.  Dude, doesn't it get all fucking...  No, but it is.  I'm not even like...  It just sounds horrible for real.  I know what you're trying to go for.  When you sing your sentences, Ope, I know you're lying.  But it does.  But I'm not lying in this case.  I swear to you, I'm not.  This is the best sounds horrible.  The best boat ever.  Where do you store it?  Doesn't it get all seawater, like lakey smelling and dirty?  No.  Lakey smelling.  Could we slow down a little bit? 
[01:46:30]  Why did Jimmy break your boat?  Where was it?  Well, the seat...  Take that fucking hand off there, Sam.  Move the mouse.  I hate the hand.  I hate it, right?  But I want to know why you broke his boat.  The day I got it, we were putting it in the car, because it all folds up in a bag.  At Noam's house.  And it all folds up into like a backpack, so you can just take it to the river, throw  it in your trunk.  Yeah, boom.  And that seat folds up, and there's a leather thing that goes across.  It keeps it shut with a button.  Okay.  And you're not supposed to...  It keeps the seat shut.  It's like a button, like a button... 
[01:47:00]  It's like a button on your shirt, but it buttons to keep it shut.  Snap.  Horrible.  And Jimmy, I said, Jimmy, take...  He goes, can I help?  I go, take this to the car.  And he grabs it by the...  Like a hand...  He made a handle out of it.  Oh.  So...  And he ripped off.  It should have been rugged enough.  I agree.  Yeah, it's for the outdoors.  It should be rugged.  It's a fucking boat.  It's not a handle, Jimmy.  How do you break a boat by carrying it?  It's not a handle.  I didn't know that.  Poor little fish.  It was a seat closer.  I didn't know that.  You know what?  I don't like this boat at all.  It's the best boat ever.  Have you used it?  I've used it.  Look at him trying to row. 
[01:47:30]  It stinks.  He looks like he's going to tip over at any moment.  The Sea Eagle pontoon is the Cadillac of fly fishing boats.  Exactly.  It's sink in Cadillac wood.  I love that boat, Jimmy.  Have I used it?  Yeah, I've used it.  And you should end up like they did good times in the Cadillac.  Or like Fredo in The Godfather 2.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I say Hail Marys.  I hope I pull a pizza out.  I'm right with the fucking fat jokes.  I'm trying.  This fucking twat right out of the gate.  Thank you.  Yeah, I'm trying to avoid all that today. 
[01:48:00]  I'm going to do something different today.  Listen, it's the best boat out there.  You used it in New Hampshire when you were up there?  Five times.  By myself.  How was it?  It's unbelievable.  The reason why boats like this suck is that you have to throw it on top of your car, tie  it down.  He's showing that you can fucking fish on one foot and not tip over.  It's really stable.  You can't really tip it.  You can put a motor on it.  Look at this.  Watch that.  He's standing on one edge of the boat.  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  Where's that kid who he gave it to for his birthday?  Get him on the boat.  Pull his pants down. 
[01:48:30]  Get him in water.  What this boat is saying to me is you're making it loud and clear.  You don't want me fly fishing with you anymore.  No, but I have-  I don't see a seat for me.  I have two.  There's a double seat that goes in the front.  We face each other.  Really?  Really?  Remember the river we went down?  Yeah.  Remember the river?  Are we going down that river?  You can go down that river in this.  It's a class A rabbit.  I'll hang with Rich.  Yeah, you can.  Rich likes you better anyways.  It'll be me and Rich and then you could be in your pond, whatever the fuck, your fucking  robot. 
[01:49:00]  It's a sea eagle.  It's called a sea eagle.  It's called a queer carrier.  Frameless.  A queer carrier?  Where are you going?  Are you going to shit?  Yeah.  It's going to go to shitties.  I haven't read before, so I wasn't able to go to shit.  I love when it has to shit.  Why?  It's got a shitties.  It just makes me happy.  Come on.  Bob, we're not doing the thing in Roscoe this year?  Yeah, but we're not going to use poets up there.  You're walking the river.  No, we're going with Rich again.  I don't think so.  You don't like Rich?  I love Rich.  I've been in touch with Rich ever since.  I love Rich.  Rich is a great guy.  What do you do to you? 
[01:49:30]  But why did you say you're not going with Rich?  I said we'd go up, we'd walk the river.  We're not going to do the boat thing.  We didn't catch anything.  I know, but the water was high, remember?  We didn't catch a thing.  Water was high, which means they had to stay low.  It was eight hours of not catching anything.  So let's give them another shot.  I say we'd go to the river where we caught things.  There was a lot of rain that came in.  That was a year ago.  You even said the level of the river was way too high to fish that day.  We could have found a spot to go in.  I'd go with Rich.  I have confidence in Rich. 
[01:50:00]  Go with Rich, and you can pass me on the way.  I want to go with you, too.  No, we're not going, Rich.  Then what are we doing?  We're going to go.  We're going to go in your little rowboat.  First of all, we've got to get a place to stay, because you've ruined that.  I didn't ruin that.  You did.  How did I ruin that?  Because you had to make a video of the poor dirt garden, and then tell everybody how much  the place sucked.  And then we had to go back up there, and then you had to expose her again.  No, I didn't expose her.  She was waiting for us to come.  She waited a year to confront me. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, because you understand, she's a little eight.  Do people understand that?  We did that whole thing last year.  Yeah.  But basically, we tried to check into our spot, me and Bobby's spot.  Well, you have to put bug spray on the pillow.  Right.  And she remembered the video I made the year prior, and couldn't wait for us to come back  so she could give me a talking to.  Well, you know why?  Because your video, whenever you typed in the Roscoe Motel on Google, the first thing  that comes up is the most popular.  Yeah, the most popular thing.  I got the most popular video out of Roscoe in New York?  You hit 40,000 hits on that thing. 
[01:51:00]  Nice.  You made a miniseries of Lonesome Dove.  Nice.  People like our miniseries that we've done together.  People would show her that.  I know.  In her poor hotel.  Remember, she had a picture of me.  She was just waiting.  Yeah.  I was on her desktop.  You were denying it.  For a year.  Yeah.  Well, we could stay in the other place with the roosters.  I can't stay.  That was a nightmare.  No?  No, it was like an old haunted house.  And don't we have to go soon?  Isn't it like prime?  October 15th.  That seems late in the season, Bobby.  October 15th is the last day you can fish, I think. 
[01:51:30]  I will absolutely have a second kid by then, too.  October 15th.  You're already having another baby?  Where have you been?  You're not my friend anymore?  What's wrong with you?  I know she was pregnant, but I didn't know it was coming now.  Any week.  Oh, my God.  I'm down on any...  It could happen right now.  All right.  Keep it on the QT, would you?  Whoa.  We're over eight months pregnant.  It's happening.  It's going down.  That was the countdown on my website, by the way.  What?  I tricked everybody. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  You have a website?  Kind of.  What the hell is your website?  It's just OP Radio.  It just links everything.  Dot com?  Oh, yeah.  That's all it is.  It's nothing special.  That's the...  You had a countdown?  Yeah.  People thought it was for our contract, but that was for my wife's pregnancy.  What kind of page is that?  Who did that?  I got a guy.  I like it.  It's just basic shit.  It's got my Twitter feed over there.  It's got my Instagram over there.  Get off me, Edgar.  It's got my YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter links over this. 
[01:52:30]  Nice.  And then it's got my latest videos kind of right there, front and center.  Let me see.  What is that?  A Say Now page?  And then a couple...  It's sort of in the...  It's sort of like a Say Now, but it's not Say Now.  And there's me with a young Sam Kinison with my Bill Cosby sweatshirt sweater.  All right, look.  I was young.  You don't have a Sam Kinison picture, so don't make fun of me.  You had that sunflower hairdo?  What do you mean?  Just that sunflower burst in the front.  What do you mean? 
[01:53:00]  Right in the front there.  The bangs went down to the left, to the right, and to the back.  That's how people wore their hair back then.  What am I...  No, not everybody.  What am I saying, Sam?  You're not holding a watch.  Not everybody.  What do you mean, not everybody?  I could show you a million fucking guys with that same hair.  Yeah, you could.  You fuck.  They'd probably be in a parade, too.  Bunch of Peter Pumpers, right, Bobo?  Fucking home run, Kelly.  You're all right with the sweater?  You're all right with the sweater in that shot? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, what is that?  What is that?  A little Tello sweater?  It's a horrible sweater from the Times.  Yeah.  Horrible.  Yeah.  I like the sweater.  It's not bad.  I wish I could Photoshop the sweater out.  Why?  Perfect.  Because then my Sam Kinison picture would be a little cooler.  Just a little cooler.  I think the sweater's great.  I think it's fantastic.  What is he wearing?  It's a horrible sweater.  He's wearing fucking...  What's he wearing?  I can't even tell you.  Did he die in 91 or 92?  Somewhere around there.  I think 91, right?  Somewhere around there.  It's been 20 years already. 
[01:54:00]  Were you friends with him?  No.  No.  I was just starting out in radio and I got to meet him.  Look at that seagull.  Met him a couple times.  He was a really nice guy when he was yelling and screaming.  Was he different off?  Was he different off radio?  He was a fucking human being, man.  Just a regular dude?  Yeah.  He cared about people.  Absolutely.  Really?  I think so.  Yeah.  Anyway, back to the fly fishing boat.  I met him once.  Did you meet him once?  Talked to him at Rascals.  He came in and talked to a couple of the comedians.  Me and my buddy talked to him for about five minutes, ten minutes, and he signed a napkin 
[01:54:30]  for me.  I didn't get pictures back then.  I got to go to Rascals.  I'm in the South Ocean Township.  The famous Rascals.  Yeah.  Wow.  So, Bob, you got Levity this weekend starting tonight through Sunday.  LevityLive.com.  It's West Nyack, New York in the Palisades Mall.  Yeah.  It's a great spot for comedy.  Yeah, I'm excited.  And they got the mall, so you can do some shit too.  Yeah, I'm excited to be there.  You should be.  I like it up there.  I like the peeps.  How's your voice?  It's bad.  What the hell's going on?  I don't know, dude.  I lost my voice two months ago in Vegas when we went to Vegas. 
[01:55:00]  For the MMA?  For the MMA.  Were you yelling at the event?  No, we didn't yell.  We didn't do anything.  Maybe it popped something.  Nothing.  I don't know what I did ever.  Have you been checked?  I've been checked.  No polyps, no nothing, and I just haven't been able to get it back.  There's no lumps in your throat?  No lumps.  Oh, you know, throat cancer, at least.  That's good.  Thanks.  Maybe it's a reflux.  So, what are they saying it is?  Probably a reflux.  You get acid reflux?  Yeah, but I've been taking my pills, so I haven't had it.  But when that acid comes up, it does some damage, man.  Yeah.  It might be something like that.  I don't know.  I can't get my voice.  I keep losing it, but I've been gigging constantly. 
[01:55:30]  So, I have shows every week, so it's fucking, I keep, I gotta learn how to do my act differently  or something and not scream or I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.  Sounds a little weird right now.  Yeah, it's like a little tranny, right?  It's a little deep.  A little deeper.  Yeah, man.  It could be like a boss jock.  Bob, your voice is your instrument.  We've stopped touching me.  I'm not just trying to make a point, Bob.  Yeah, but I don't like that every character touches me.  He's just trying to make a point.  This is a character.  Get off me with the fingernails.  See, that's the character. 
[01:56:00]  That was Jimmy showing concern.  When you want to show a little extra concern, you fucking touch the guy's arm.  You pinch him with his fingernails?  No, that was the character.  That's what he was trying to tell you.  You should give that shirt.  There's two different things.  Can you button that shirt, please?  Is it like my belly sticking out?  I don't like seeing your belly.  I don't like seeing a grown man's belly.  It's uncomfortable.  It's me.  It's bringing up feelings.  Is it weird to see it without hands on your head?  Yeah.  I like seeing that.  Wait, there's something else I was going to ask you.  The voice, the thing.  There was something. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, fuck.  What was it?  Oh, the TV show.  What's up?  It's in FX's hands.  So you're still waiting for them to decide?  It takes a long time.  They've got to do notes.  They've got to do edits.  They've got to do producer edits.  For the people, you've filmed a pilot for FX.  It's huge.  So many people do edits and notes, and then FX has to do their thing, and then I think  they have to test.  Focus groups.  Yeah, they do all kinds of weird shit.  What do you think?  What are you hearing so far?  Anything?  So far, FX had some good notes, and they're smart people. 
[01:57:00]  So they know what they want, which is good.  And they like the last one.  So I don't know, dude.  I'm kind of staying away from it.  You obviously don't know anything.  Because I'd rather fall off the second floor of Hope than the tenth floor.  You know what I mean?  I hear you.  Because you've been there so many times.  This is the best thing.  This is so good.  People tell you how wonderful it is.  You start buying fucking real estate and better clothes, and then all of a sudden it's just 
[01:57:30]  gone.  How was this shit?  I feel like a prison rape came sliding out.  That was great, huh?  No, it was like you're burning.  I think I went to Chipotle.  I went to Chipotle.  Oh, my God.  Chipotle rules.  Last night.  That shit is spicy.  Chipotle?  Was that shit facing the wall?  Dude, it was so spicy.  Oh, what a spicy shit.  They had to get their mild salsa, which is still spicy.  It was fucking crazy.  That's the problem with the Chipotle.  You go, Chipotle.  I love Chipotle.  It feels like I got a suppository put in, coated in Vicks VapoRub. 
[01:58:00]  Yikes.  That's good food, though, man.  I love Chipotle.  It's really fresh.  I love Chipotle.  What's that?  Chipotle.  Well, Chipotle, three soft tacos.  That's where I go.  Really?  I go with the burrito bowl.  That burrito's nice.  I like the burrito bowl.  I had the burrito.  You go brown rice or white rice?  White rice.  Black beans or the pinto beans?  Black beans.  What kind of chicken?  Or do you go beef?  That's shredded.  Shredded beef.  Yeah.  Shredded beef.  Oh, chicken. 
[01:58:30]  I do three soft tacos.  I do shredded beef.  Two shredded beef and one pork.  I don't know how the burrito put itself back together and came out my ass full size.  We ate at one in L.A. and that's when RuPaul was sitting at the table behind us.  As what?  Just as a guy.  As him?  Yeah.  As RuPaul.  He goes through life as a guy.  Deep throating the burrito.  He goes through life as a guy that hasn't shaved.  That's his look.  I'm serious.  Every picture I've seen, that's what you see.  Yeah.  It freaks me out how he can really just turn into a hot black chick with hips. 
[01:59:00]  You think that's hot?  Really?  Yeah.  It's so obvious a trend.  I'm 41 and I've been married for five years.  My hot meter is getting my hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at that.  The bar's a little lower.  God, that's way lower.  That's just a dude.  Yeah, that's a dude.  Let me see you, Ru.  Go to the girl version.  All right, go to the girl version of RuPaul.  Let's try to have an open mind here.  Please.  All right.  Now go to the bar.  I have an open ass appearance. 
[01:59:30]  That's no.  Look at how hot she is.  She's wonderful.  What?  Oh, God.  That's so fucking retouched.  And I don't know how they do the boobs in such a way that she has cleavage.  Yeah, they tape and makeup.  Okay, this one I wouldn't do right down there.  No.  Really?  No.  She should do a movie dating herself.  That sounds like an Adam Sandler movie.  Sounds wacky.  That's an Adam Sandler movie.  What are you doing?  Tyler Perry put that together. 
[02:00:00]  That's funny.  Tyler Perry's I'm Dating Myself.  He kind of does it, though.  See, look, he's dressed as Michelle Obama and Obama.  Oh, is that what it is?  You can't tell that's what that is.  Oh, okay.  Is that true?  I heard the best racist joke ever.  Oh, when did I tell it?  The emcee that was hosting this weekend, this past weekend, he goes, I saw twin black guys,  or I'm just really racist. 
[02:00:30]  That's not bad.  Wow.  What the fuck is that?  RuPaul looks like he has AIDS.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  Doesn't?  Look.  No.  That's not AIDS.  Skinny or older gentleman with a nice hat.  Is that it?  It's, uh, I don't know.  Did we ever have him on?  AIDS, you don't get thin anymore, dude.  No, you're so fat.  That's like 80s AIDS.  That's 80s AIDS?  We're in 2000.  Yeah, 2000 AIDS, you just get a pot belly and fat fingers.  That fucking, uh, what's his name? 
[02:01:00]  McMillan and wife there.  Rock Hudson AIDS.  That was bad.  Yeah, that's 80s AIDS.  Oh, man, that is such 80s AIDS.  Because nobody, no one had seen Rock Hudson in a while,  so everybody was like, oh, yeah, from McMillan and wife,  that guy, from fucking the movies.  And then he came out for something,  and they were like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  That was when everyone went, oh, AIDS, oh.  Well, a lot of people, they'd come and tell you, like,  that it was a virus, and nobody knew what it was.  The doctor can't do anything about it, farce. 
[02:01:30]  They can't do anything about it.  So I guess I should just have to have sex with you now,  so I can get it.  Yeah, you dummy.  I buried her under the tree.  I used a straw as a coffin.  Forrest, why isn't she wearing shoes in the grass, Forrest?  She's going to kill the lawn.  Oh, they're AIDS-y feet.  Forrest, her toenails are digging into the grass.  I don't want her to get AIDS on the forest.  I love this Gary Sinise.  It's fucking great.  It's right on.  They're titanium. 
[02:02:00]  I'm not worried about my feet,  because they were blown off in Vietnam,  but I'm worried about my fatty wife Susan's feet.  Forrest, you killed all the corn.  You buried her in the ground and ruined the soil.  You gave AIDS to the fucking grass.  Now you have AIDS corn.  It pops on the fucking stalk.  You don't eat it, you shove it in your ass.  Oh, there's 80s AIDS right there.  Yeah, yeah.  That's when Rock Hudson came out. 
[02:02:30]  It was like, what's wrong with Rock?  That's just fucked up.  Rock Hudson, if he wasn't famous and didn't have the money,  was just a redneck.  Look at that.  He was just a hillbilly.  Oh, you think?  Look at that.  He got real AIDS-y.  Yeah, he got AIDS-y.  He's all jaundice-y.  All AIDS-y.  AIDS-y.  What is going on with you, Bobby?  What's up?  Give him the big update.  Bad Boys, maybe a sitcom.  Not a sitcom.  Maybe a TV show.  Bad Dad TV show.  Fly fishing boat for one person.  Nice.  Love the idea of that fly fishing boat. 
[02:03:00]  Wow, it's the best.  Can I bring it over to your pool?  Yeah, take it in the pool.  Have a demonstration.  That would be really funny.  Have a demonstration in Ann's pool.  I'd be kind of...  Dude, here you are in the pool.  Look, I'll show you everything it does.  Yeah.  I caught.  You could show all the bells and whistles.  And then we could be on the water.  It's got a lot of bells and whistles.  And put little plastic fish on your hook.  Give it a little tug.  No, you can actually...  We can play war.  And I'm the Germans.  Sorry, wait a second.  I want to be the Germans.  I don't want to offend you.  Yes, you can be the Germans. 
[02:03:30]  And I'm still on the beaches of Normandy.  Yes.  And I pull up on my boat.  You have to shoot.  No, I backed out on it.  You did.  You did.  I saw that.  We're trying today, Bobby.  I was trying to be nice.  We're going to do something a little different.  We're trying.  I'm trying.  Hey, I like when you talk about the bells and whistles.  So what are the bells and whistles on this rowboat?  First of all, it's got a swivel seat.  So I'm going to explain.  Okay?  When you're on one of the regular boats...  I've done the swivel seat. 
[02:04:00]  I've got to be with Bobby.  If there's a fish over there, you have to turn the whole boat over there.  Right?  But now you just do the swivel seat.  You just kind of move your hips and it turns your direction.  Turns it.  And you can put a...  It's got a motor mount in the back.  That motor is shitty.  You swivel your seat.  That's an electric motor, you jackass.  It's a little electric motor.  Look how old it is.  Yeah, but you can't use a regular motor.  Put a fucking giant mercury.  100 horsepower.  And how fast do you go?  And if you swivel your seat, your feet go in the fucking water. 
[02:04:30]  7,000.  Now your feet don't go in the water.  They do.  I mean, there's no room.  Look at these swivel around.  You fucking...  You're going to drag your toes over the motor and lose fucking...  Swivel.  When you sit down in a seat, your knees aren't supposed to hit your chin, Bobby.  It's horrid.  Now look at the...  Look at that.  It's horrendous looking.  It's not...  It's not comfy.  But here's the thing is if you're a little longer like yourself, if you have a longer gait  than me...  Oh, thank you, Bobby.  You can get a seat riser that brings the seat up a little higher.  Oh, great.  Yeah, and get that center of gravity just precariously perched. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Say that five times, P-boy.  Center of gravity precariously perched.  But that makes a good point.  The reason the seat's so low is because if you're too high, that fuck is going to tip  over.  What's he doing?  He's cranking with the oars.  No, I think he's exhausted from having to paddle his own rowboat.  Now, this is the best part.  Look at that.  The seagull fits in a bag right in your truck.  Yeah, it never fits that meat.  At Dutch Joe, it absolutely does.  You'll never put it back in that bag like that.  I think it stinks me up.  I've done it five times.  Dude, 42 pounds.  He's lugging 50 pounds for the woods.  You're not carrying 42 pounds because then you have your other shit. 
[02:05:30]  What about the motor?  No, I'm just saying this is 42 pounds plus just the boat.  Plus your fishing gear, plus your backpack.  Look at this.  Wait, wait.  Isn't that how dirty that is when you put it back in the bag?  Oh, yeah.  It stinks.  No, that's a fucking lake water.  Look at that.  And fish guts.  And the smell of fish.  Hey, can we play?  I like the idea that the oars are fastened.  Let's go backwards because we've got to hear the audio of this.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the audio.  All the way back.  Let's hear the big pitch.  This is what Bobby bought.  One of my favorite songs.  To fill some emptiness in his soul. 
[02:06:00]  Put it to your launching spot.  Simply unroll it.  And inflate it.  It's a blow-up doll.  It comes loaded with a full fabric floor.  An inflatable seat.  Four convenient carry handles.  And spike shoes.  And a few built-in rod holders.  And spike shoes.  Two rod holders.  Set up is easy, too.  Do not wear cleats.  It has no frame.  Look at that.  No frame.  There's nothing to assemble.  He's talking about you.  In just four minutes, you are ready to go after the big ones.  He's talking about you'll be boneless.  Several option packages let you add a wooden floorboard, a swivel seat, motor mount, and motor. 
[02:06:30]  Our ultimate pack, as shown here, features the Torquedo electric outboard motor.  That's one bad hat, Harry.  It's best electric outboard.  Handy, optional stove pouches.  I got those.  Flip on easily to hold your gear.  I got that.  Slide it easily into the water.  I'll never get in a seagull again.  Or use our new easy cart to wheel it like a hand cart right to the water's edge.  It really is that easy.  On the water, the friendless pontoon boat is extremely stable. 
[02:07:00]  So stable, you can stand to cast.  That's because the twin pontoons create a very wide beam.  So a seagull in the water had bumped into it.  It toppled over.  Boat goes in the water.  Bob gets in the boat.  Seagull goes to the bottom of the lake.  Farewell and adieu to you.  Inflatable seagull in the water.  That makes the friendless pontoon boat highly maneuverable. 
[02:07:30]  I hate this boat.  This boat's the best boat ever.  It's a raft.  It's not a raft.  It's a boat.  It's a shallow draft.  It's a sea eagle.  A squirrel that slammed two acorns into our side.  We sank in two minutes.  What happens if the thing pops?  It's class A wrappers, you eggplant.  What if a hook?  What about a hook?  A fish hook.  It's class A.  What happens if it does pop?  Class A.  What happens though?  You can't hook a hook into it.  Do you got like a tire kit? 
[02:08:00]  A fly fishing hook is not.  I'm not.  He's going to take a hammer to it.  Oh.  Wait.  But the other side.  You certainly wouldn't try this with any ordinary boat.  51, a bunch of popped ones on the side.  Can you pause this?  He just said, you certainly wouldn't try this with any ordinary boat.  Yeah.  Put a hammer to an ordinary boat.  Yes, of course you would.  And the claw wasn't a straight claw.  Right.  It was a curved claw on the hammer.  So it's not hitting anything sharp.  And then they had a sound effect to make it sound better. 
[02:08:30]  You're not supposed to do it at all.  Hit it with a hammer?  You're not supposed to hit a boat with a hammer.  That makes a good point.  It's like, look, you're not even supposed to ever do that.  I saw it in a commercial.  When you're down these rivers, there's a lot of sticks and stuff.  Rocks and sticks.  Yeah, near the fucking banks.  Jagged things.  Jagged things.  You're going to pop this shit.  You don't pop it.  You're not going to pop it.  It's going to pop.  It's not going to pop.  How hard would you laugh if he fucking his boat...  Oh, my God.  If I was on it?  If you were all wet, just dead.  Well, the best part is you don't have to wear your... 
[02:09:00]  On the other boat, your feet go in the water.  Right.  I don't like that.  So is your boat muddy somewhere right now?  No.  Of course it is.  No, it isn't.  It isn't, Jim.  First of all, you've never done anything outside, ever.  What have you done outside?  I've been fishing.  It stinks.  What are you, some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Where'd you go fishing?  Fucking Vermont.  Stop swearing.  Where?  It's boring.  When I was a kid, a bunch of innocent fish minding the business.  I'm not talking about a Zebco with a barber.  I don't know what that large-mouthed bass will do.  It might eat it, I suppose. 
[02:09:30]  See, because it's small.  I love fishing.  I just hate your sea eagles.  Can't stay down with five sea bass and sea fucking things in my head.  I fucking tripped.  I said sea bass.  I'm really enjoying the ranching going on about the sea eagles.  Go with your little sea eagles.  Go with trout.  Five trout.  This boat is amazing.  If you have a good day of fishing, the thing will sink.  This is for lakes, too, by the way, when you're fishing, fly fishing on a lake or a pond.  You're not going in a lake with this fucking robot. 
[02:10:00]  I've been in it seven times.  I've already used it.  You said five a minute ago.  Five times I've been using it.  That means two times.  No, I've used it five times.  And you got the swivel seat?  Swivel seat.  That's pretty good.  Did you fix what Jimmy broke?  I can't stand, Anthony.  I love you so much, dude.  Because you're going to trashing, and then you go, you get the swivel seat?  That's all right.  Well, because I understand.  I have to turn the whole boat with stakes.  Well, we all understand the swivel seat.  And you're out there alone?  We don't have a problem with the swivel seat.  Alone?  On the fucking ocean?  On the fucking lake?  On the lake?  On the lake?  It's better than being in the meatpacking district alone at three in the morning. 
[02:10:30]  No, it's not.  Yes, you're right.  But if you have a friend, the meatpacking district is much better.  Who is this in a pond by yourself?  That's just me.  It fucking blows.  It's the same thing as you fishing for hookers.  I'm fishing for trout.  That's true.  I don't have enough.  This is cheaper.  Yeah, but I don't have to pack her up into a bag and carry her home.  You will someday.  Sometimes Jimmy has a hard time pulling his cock out of her mouth.  He's not pulling it out like a hook.  You got to use a pair of needle nose pliers. 
[02:11:00]  This one's too young.  Throw it back.  She's a sea eagle, but it's just the letter C.  Bobby, I'm just upset that we don't get to do this together anymore.  You've made it loud and clear.  You want to be out there by yourself.  Bobby.  Oh, man.  I really.  Opie.  It was our thing.  This is what you do.  It was our thing.  This is what you do.  Let me look at me.  Anthony and Jimmy.  Yeah.  This is what he does.  It drives me fucking batty.  All right.  Then let's fight.  My wife does the same thing you do. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, man.  I'm a chick.  You'll take a little thing and you'll fucking just.  And I'll tell you, it's not it and you'll keep going with it.  But you do it with a fucking smile on your face, you cocksucker.  Do I?  Do I?  You fuck.  Is that what I'm doing?  You're cocksuckers.  At least they're trashing me out in the open.  You're fucking getting them under my skin.  I'm a little covert.  He's a Navy SEAL trasher.  He's slow.  He's like fucking 007. 
[02:12:00]  You're dead on the floor because you drank his fucking poison.  What I'm saying, like a chick, my feelings have been hurt.  Uh-oh.  You want to go fishing without me.  You know what?  You know we have a good time.  First of all, if that's true, that's the most amazing thing that's ever been said on this show.  First of all.  My feelings are a bit hurt.  Oh, man.  You're making it obvious you want to be out there by yourself now.  We only go once a year.  Dude, if you had one of those, you two could you tie them together and shit?  Imagine that.  That's gay.  That'd be great. 
[02:12:30]  And then shoot each other like fucking...  We're not docking our boats on our lakes.  We all come together.  I think what's happening here, me and Bobby have gone fly fishing twice.  I'm bad luck, right?  You do way better when I'm not around.  No, you are.  You're not bad luck at all.  It's the last time we went, we did that boat stuff.  Jimmy goes fly fishing at the rest stops.  Jimmy puts his dick out of the...  Oh, I caught a big one.  Jimmy puts his dick out of the door of the stall and wiggles it. 
[02:13:00]  Wiggles it like fucking...  What are you using over there?  Yeah, you put your pecker in the water.  Oh, God damn fucking shit.  We might have to go to break.  I don't know.  There's a gay guy driving by the woods at a rest stop.  He's like, what's that?  What is it?  What are you using over there?  What do you got over there?  What are they biting on today? 
[02:13:30]  What are they biting on?  He's matching the hatch.  Oh, big daddy.  I don't know.  You know what?  I don't need you, you fuck.  How could you bash him?  I'm going to call Rich.  I'm calling up Rich.  You're not going to have fun with Rich.  Jimmy just put his shoe on a puppy sandwich.  Hey, you broke one of our lights. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, shit.  Holy shit, that was hilarious.  Jimmy took off his shoe.  I didn't want to smash it.  I didn't want to get it all over him.  I couldn't help it.  It was just sitting there begging me to punch it.  So Jimmy put his dirty fucking shoe right up on his breakfast burrito.  And just laid it on top of his burrito.  Is that the shoe you've had for like fucking nine years?  Yeah, these shoes have seen better days.  Bobby had to just throw it out.  What are you going to do?  You can't eat it.  Bobby, you could have ate that.  Oh, Bobby.  I replaced it perfectly.  No.  In the city, you know what the fuck you're stepping on? 
[02:14:30]  You brush that off and you eat that shit.  Oh my God, no.  I couldn't punch it though.  I didn't want to get all over him.  Yeah, that would have sucked.  I got a big audition today.  I can't really knock him.  You know, that's probably, if you're into fishing, that's probably pretty cool.  It looks a little flimsy.  It does look, I'd have gone with the next step up.  There's no next step up.  There is.  There's not.  There's gotta be.  There's no next step up.  One that's a little wider maybe.  There's no step up.  Yes, there is.  No, there isn't.  The Edmund Fitzgeralds.  He was a lonely zilch in the middle of the lake, and we were all hoping he'd die really 
[02:15:00]  quickly.  Oh, man, Jim.  You're a fucking Jim.  Jim's an Edmund Fitzgerald.  I thought we were going to do that today, Bobby.  It's Jim.  He's a mean.  Jim is an asshole at heart.  Well, we all know that.  And when he gets on a roll, you can't.  I'm going to make it to 10 without one. 
[02:15:30]  Not yet.  I'm going to.  I'm going to.  Jim is just a mean.  You're just a mean guy, Jim.  You're a mean person.  You've ruined my sandwich.  You've ruined my boat.  And you've hurt my feelings.  You're not a friend.  That's what I said to somebody yesterday.  Yeah, if you go on O&A, if they don't know you, they'll help you.  If you're friends with them, it's the worst thing you can do for your career.  It really is terrible.  Oh, yes.  It's the worst thing you can do for your career.  I'm ordering you one right now.  Opie's the only genuine guy in Anthony.  I think.  Well, that's two out of three. 
[02:16:00]  That's what I meant.  Oh.  Stupid.  Stop doing math.  Yeah, man.  That means it's only me.  Yeah, exactly.  But you almost made me feel special.  I was happy there for a second.  I was happy there for a second.  I wanted to do some mean math.  I like 200 plus 300 equals him.  Get off me.  Get off me.  I'm sick of you, Jim.  I'm sick of Jim.  That's all he does.  Every time I come on, he's just fat, fat, fat.  And then I get to listen to his stupid fucking fans on Twitter. 
[02:16:30]  Fat, fat, fat.  I block.  It's a nightmare.  Just block.  Block away.  I should rather not come on the show.  More people would show up this weekend at Levity Live tonight.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  More people would show up.  That's a very strange plot.  You did imply that I should burrow in dirt, though, when I said I wasn't sleeping.  Oh, burrow in dirt?  I would never say that.  That's pretty funny.  I would never say that.  I don't sleep well, and Bob goes, have you tried to fucking burrow in dirt?  And then he goes, why don't you land or a potted plant?  I never said that. 
[02:17:00]  I never.  I would never say that about you.  You should take care of that.  That's really funny.  Yeah, I would.  That's really funny.  To a girl we were talking to.  What girl?  Kristen.  Oh, she's not a girl.  Why don't we break?  Bob Kelly, Levity Live, West Nyack, New York, to the Palisades Mall tonight through Sunday.  Highly recommend to see Bob Kelly.  You should just do your fucking stand-up sitting down in your boat on your swivel seat.  Dude, dude.  With a fishing pole.  If we did Billy the Bassman.  The curtain opens and you're just like, hey, how you doing, people?  Can you have Sea Eagle night?  And you're just casting.  Sea Eagle night.  Hey, people. 
[02:17:30]  So, let me tell you a little story.  And you tell these long-winded stories.  Oh, God.  There's a lot of people in New Hampshire that story tell.  Oh.  Do you know what they have?  Ew.  No, I'm serious.  What is that?  Can we talk about this next?  Yeah, sure.  Storytelling.  All right.  Let's not get distracted.  Let's not get distracted.  Because I know we're going to go off on that for a while.  I want to hear this.  And we got big ends coming in at 930.  All right, we'll take a break.  We got this coming in at 930.  This?  I kind of like it.  Oh, God.  You kind of like this?  Yeah, that's kind of my thing.  Not my type.  Yeah.  Not quite my type.  I wouldn't, I mean, I wouldn't, you know, get married and go to fucking Aruba together. 
[02:18:00]  But this?  I'd fucking.  That's your type.  It's like Steven Tyler with huge tits.  I'd take a cab.  This?  I'd take a cab.  All right.  More with Bob Kelly.  Stay there.  He's one of the biggest comedy names in Middle America and south of the Mason-Dixon line.  Play it, Jim, and give it up.  It's Billy the Bassman.  Where are we going?  All right, man.  Where are we going?  Oh, I'll tell you where we're going.  Go to Fun and Lamb.  He's back.  With an all-new CD.  Where are we going?  What are the termites eat for breakfast? 
[02:18:30]  Oh, what, Billy?  Oak meal.  Where are we going?  Fat, uneducated slobs are calling it a comedic masterpiece.  Did you hear about the lookalike competition in China?  Yeah, everybody won.  Jim Crow is rolling in his grave with laughter.  Fuck that.  Oh, hey.  I hate the fucking.  Just like you do.  Where are we going?  Move over, Larry the Cable Guy.  There's a new bland, predictable redneck in town.  All right.  What's Mary short for?  She got no legs. 
[02:19:00]  Where are we going?  It's Billy the Bassman.  And his all-new CD.  Where are we going?  Available now at truck stops and cracker barrels everywhere.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this F.U. goes out to that fucking whore that I used to bone with her 38 double Ds to ruin my life. 
[02:19:30]  Fuck you and your gigantic, natural, tremendous tits.  You fucking psycho whore.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd just like to say fuck you to all you assholes with your stupid little six-figured decals on the back of your SUVs to tell us how many fucking dogs and cats and kids and mothers and fathers you got.  Who gives a shit?  Fuck you.  I'd like to give a big fuck you out to anyone that doesn't like the word cunt. 
[02:20:00]  You're all fucking cunt faces.  Fuck you, cunt faces.  Fuck you.  This is a big fuck you goes out to Nikki Sixx of Mommy Crews, you fat, rooster-haired, trapless cunt.  Stop talking about you being an artist.  You're an ex-drug addict who doesn't know any other string on your friggin' instrument except the T-string.  Learn how to fucking play your instrument before you call yourself an artist squad.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Is it just me or does Nina Blackwood sound like First of the Clown? 
[02:20:30]  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  To my ex-wife, fuck you.  If you happen to pass the waves before me, I will go to your grave and pee for shit on it.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  This fuck you goes out to everyone who says they can't stop singing Mimi Beardsley.  Shut up.  Go fuck yourself.  We get it.  It's a song.  It's catchy.  It's fucking awesome.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  This F.U. goes out to the woman in line in front of me at Walmart last night. 
[02:21:00]  You didn't fit your pants and you smelled like you shit yourself.  Had to smell that until you left and it still lingered.  F.U.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:21:30]  Bob Kelly in studio.  Shut up, Bobby.  I got this part.  Levity Live, West Nyack, New York, in the Palisades Mall tonight through Sunday.  LevityLive.com for Bob Kelly.  Welcome back.  And I got Dan Soto with me, too.  I like Dan Soto.  From my show.  And Kelly Festuca, the other girl on my show, is going to be there.  Fucking Dan Soto.  Soto.  Yeah.  As we say in Long Island for Soto.  Soto.  Yeah.  Did our show?  Yeah, he's a funny guy.  And he passed the audition.  He will be back.  He's really good.  He's a very funny kid.  Very funny guy. 
[02:22:00]  Jimmy left to get his picture with Tony Danza.  Tony Danza?  I'm going to be running for mayor of New York City.  Look at my hog in my Spider-Man outfit.  That was hilarious.  That was one of our favorite moments.  Oh, God.  When he had his goddamn talk show.  It was fantastic.  He came back with his apron on?  Yeah.  Covering his fucking big...  Covering his...  My big hog.  My big Tony Danza dick. 
[02:22:30]  Which is a fat helmet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  His big dick was just fucking hanging down.  Just sweating.  It was terrible.  Fucking wild mushroom.  Halloween extravadanza.  I hope he does run for mayor just so we get some clips of him.  I think he is.  He's running for mayor?  Yeah.  He wants to run for mayor in New York City.  I don't think he'll come in, though.  He probably won't, but...  We got Bob Tully.  Tony Danza?  We got the big Ange.  Fucking throw me out like that sandwich.  No, you stay here.  Tony Danza comes in.  What are you, nuts?  We got the big Ange.  Coming in. 
[02:23:00]  Big Ange.  She can wait.  I don't know who she is, actually.  I wouldn't fucking...  I don't know why we said yes to the big Ange.  I don't know shit about her.  I don't either.  She's on a show.  We were talking about her, and we were watching a video of her.  The next thing you know, she's booked on the show.  I think...  I'm confused.  Well, now I remember Roland came in, and I think everybody was saying, can you get this  woman for our show?  Oh, okay.  You might have to start recording our conversations, because I think he gets frustrated, too.  All of our guest pitches to Roland are like drunk blackouts.  Well, I don't remember doing that.  Oh, yeah, you did it. 
[02:23:30]  And sometimes it's easier to just say yes, because you want to get out of the building faster.  Well, that's true.  Hey, Bobby, I know what it was.  Bobby.  New Hampshire.  Story time, guy.  Story time.  What is this storytelling?  You said everyone has a story or likes telling stories in New Hampshire.  Well, they have storytellers.  There's these guys.  What is that?  I met like three of them when I was up there.  Wow.  Boring.  At a coffee shop.  Weird.  I met one guy.  We were trying to get a piece of wood at this.  This guy has wood.  Yeah, there we were. 
[02:24:00]  Must tell you, we were out on the water.  It had to be near probably eight hours.  I'm calling you out on that one.  That's Maine.  It's up there in the same area.  It was a Maine guy that drove down.  There's no difference.  No, I've been to New Hampshire.  They speak a little differently.  Yeah?  You might have nothing to say, but they sound differently as they're saying nothing.  Can't get there from here.  That's Maine.  Petra Farm remembers.  Petra Farm remembers.  What kind of wood story do you tell?  I wanted to buy some wood, so I went outside.  There it was.  Why did you need wood? 
[02:24:30]  We're looking for a mantle for a fireplace.  He died a few years ago.  Oh, jeez.  Dude, I don't know.  What do women do?  They go on.  My mission is getting a Seagull or a new iPhone.  Hers is buying wood.  A piece of wood for a mantle?  Yeah, for a fireplace.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  It was a piece of wood that was going to be made into the mantle?  Made into a mantle.  It's a big piece of fucking wood.  Well, I don't have...  No, it's not a big fireplace.  Why'd you get it custom-made?  It's a New York City fireplace.  Get it custom-made.  It's not your mansion fireplace.  You want to buy one in the store?  It's a fucking 1820 building. 
[02:25:00]  It's when they made a fireplace in a living room just to heat up a fucking family of 18.  Get it custom-made.  Huh?  Why are you doing all the hard work?  No, it's...  Hire a guy and go, hey.  That's what we were.  That's the guy.  Oh.  We're at a wood guy place.  I thought you were getting a piece of wood, and then you were going to like...  No, this guy custom...  I thought you were going to whittle it into something.  He has all this wood, and he makes furniture, and we went in, and the guy was talking to  me, and he was like, what do you do?  I go, I do comedy, which you expect to explain first.  First mistake.  And then he goes, yeah, I do too, kind of. 
[02:25:30]  I'm a storyteller.  I do funny stories.  Oh, God.  It's just like, wow.  Storytellers.  Had a nice piece of wood, and there was a knot in it.  It was very inconvenient.  After all these years, you haven't learned that you tell these people the most boring job ever  so they don't ask to follow a Christian?  I tell that to Asian massage parlor ladies, because you can't...  Comment?  What?  Comment?  How do you mean comment?  Comedy?  You know, jokes.  Comedy?  Comedy?  Comedy?  I don't know.  Well, Asians have a very good sense of humor, I've found, over the years.  Yeah, they do.  Excuse me, when you roll over. 
[02:26:00]  It's volcano.  Look at me.  It's you.  Oh, my God.  It erupts.  They must be laughing.  Oh, baby.  Pulling that practical joke they all love to pull out on the roads, where it's like, oh,  okay, I'm doing two miles an hour, get it, because they drive slow.  Boy, was I tied up there.  I didn't know where to go.  And we both just stared at you.  There you go.  That's all you have on storytellers?  Dude, type in storytellers.  Do video search.  Don't do web search.  We're going to read it.  What are you doing?  The fuck are you doing? 
[02:26:30]  Video searching.  He wants us to read about storytelling.  And now he sees we got MTV storytellers, or VH1 storytellers.  Well, not them.  Storytellers.  Storytellers.  Yeah, New Hampshire.  From New Hampshire.  New Hampshire.  We teased this segment on the show.  It better be good.  Yeah, really.  It's terrible.  Before the break, I said we're going to talk about storytelling.  Oh, boy.  Don't let the people down, Bobby.  It's not me.  God damn it, Bobby.  It was your tease.  God damn it, Bobby.  Well, if you had a fucking guy that could find some YouTube storytelling.  What, Sam?  Stop playing games. 
[02:27:00]  Jesus, Sam.  Stop looking for wrestling clips.  Here we go.  Bob.  Let me see it.  Bob Tales.  Bob Tales.  Storytelling.  There we go, guys.  Come on.  It's by Bob Reiser.  120 views.  120 views.  Not doing that over a year.  Up there.  That's a lot.  Heroes come in every size.  Who is it?  Who is it?  Who is it?  And I found this wonderful Japanese story about a one-inch boy. 
[02:27:30]  About a bomb that went off.  A one-inch boy.  Sure.  This is the cutest thing I ever saw.  He's acting it out like there's a one-inch boy.  He's doing both.  It's got all these demons in it.  There are demons in it.  It's in Boshi.  The one-inch boy.  This guy has got to be a pedophile.  These boys, you know, I know this guy.  Oh, you're the Uncle Paul.  Sure, the one-inch boy story.  I think these characters started coming out of me as I was doing it. 
[02:28:00]  Wait, characters got out of him.  Suddenly, out from behind a bush, we have a terrible demon.  Is he in front of an audience of children?  Nine-year-olds.  Probably a firing squad.  I think I just heard him got heckled by a nine-year-old.  Yes, you suck.  Yeah, you got to keep the stories interesting.  Oh, really?  There's a little one-inch boy.  Come here.  Let me give you something to hold while I tell you this story. 
[02:28:30]  By the end of the story, he turns into a two-inch boy.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't you kiss the bag the boy's holding?  It smells like onions.  It smells like onions.  It smells like he's carrying a bag of fish.  Yes, Bobby.  So they have, you know, these bars, these local pubs, and these little restaurants,  and the guy will come in, and they'll do storytelling night.  Like comedy.  Do we have a little better audio, Sam?  Yeah, this audio is echoey.  You know who's a storyteller?  And he's very good at it.  Sleeves. 
[02:29:00]  Who's Sleeves?  I hate Sleeves.  You know what?  We probably should play the Leaf one again.  No, this is the Christmas thing.  No, this is the Christmas shit.  We're not ready for the Christmas Sleeves yet.  Don't fucking subject me to this now.  We're ready for the fall foliage.  Oh, here's Judy.  Judy.  Oh, look at this fucking lump of shit.  Come on.  He's just showing you something.  That's not me, Jim.  Oh, he is me.  I'm sorry.  You're a fucking nerd.  You know what, Jim?  Sometimes you cut deep.  Oh, shit.  That was very mean, Bobby.  I want to acknowledge that I'm being Jimmy's beat, too. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, but his timing is really brilliant.  That's why people get confused.  This woman is shaped like a mountain.  And she's got a head of...  Her hair looks like a cumulonimbus cloud.  It's a cancer wig.  She's wearing a cancer wig.  What kind of cloud is it?  A cumulonimbus storm cloud.  Look, it's all dark.  Like the ones that get done in Tampa?  Yes, they're all rolling in dark clouds.  That's what her hair looks like.  Look at a mini cloud over her head. 
[02:30:00]  That's funny.  She looks like a big man.  I hope her story...  I hope it's a bad story.  Let's just fast forward to the middle.  And then they said...  No, she's fucking...  Sonny Wartes is his wife.  And he says to me,  Get on the ride, you fat pig.  And I said,  Is he going to shoot me and dump my body in the river?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What kind of memory?  Let's hear Judy Pelkin.  Pelican.  No, Pelican.  Jokey Pelkin.  Let's hear her story.  Judy Pelkin. 
[02:30:30]  Kill herself falling.  I don't care.  That's all.  Go ahead.  Featuring Judy...  Piken.  Oh, Piken.  Oh, of course.  Piken.  Piken.  Yeah.  Instead of hiking,  that's what she does.  Beggar King.  Oh.  That was really quick.  Charles Taylor.  Can I have a piece of gum  so I can kill the hunger pains I have?  I'm sorry.  They're getting you new.  Fucking asshole.  They're ordering you new.  I don't want a new one.  Hold the shoe.  I don't want one.  Bring it in.  Hold the shoe.  Terrible. 
[02:31:00]  That was so mean, Jimmy.  Hold the nine and a half wide.  Yes, hold it.  And just gently.  Gently manipulate it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Go ahead.  The Beggar.  The Beggar King is the story  that Judy Piken's going to be.  Hold on.  Lesbian hairdo just walked by.  I saw.  Who's that?  Steve Blatter.  Steve Blatter.  Emo kid.  All right.  Let's see.  The Beggar King.  Judy Piken.  Truth and illusion.  What we see.  What we think we see. 
[02:31:30]  The pig.  Asnodai.  Oh, no.  The king of the demons  stood in chains  before King Solomon's throne.  Sounds like a cartoon.  Now that the temple is built,  said Solomon,  I will give you your freedom.  4,400 views?  How bad.  Provided that you  can give me the answer  to a question  that has plagued me deeply.  Yes.  Monistat 7.  I am asked to be a wife. 
[02:32:00]  625.  625.  Diabetes.  No, it doesn't look natural.  Go back to the question part.  We'll stop it.  Provided that you  can give me the answer  to a question  that has plagued me deeply.  Monistat 7? 
[02:32:30]  It's just too funny, dude.  The burning itch.  How do you remember  Monistat 7?  What a fucking great...  This chick.  Can we bail on this chick?  No, I want to hear her story.  This is good.  It's like her story.  This is good.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear a little more.  We'll hear a little more.  She is really overdramatic.  Are all the storytellers  dramatic like this, Bobby?  Yeah, Bobby.  What about...  They're all dramatic.  Yes, you got to tell a story.  You have to...  When you walk into a room 
[02:33:00]  and you see a woodpecker  through the window  and he looks at you  for a glance  and then begins to peck again.  Ooh, I like this story.  And then...  Bobby's a storyteller.  I sit in the rocking chair  and I grab the needle and thread  and I begin to make my mittens  knowing that the winter  will come soon.  I can feel the door open  and the wind curls my toes.  There was a loud...  Crashing sound  as the rock... 
[02:33:30]  Shutters.  So me and Jimmy  are storytellers together?  Bobby, I for one...  He just insults you  as you're telling a story.  But I for one  was enjoying the storytelling, Bobby.  Sorry, go ahead.  I was enjoying it.  So I have.  Can you add like candlelight  or something?  Yeah, you're knitting mittens.  I'm knitting mittens.  Maybe a cold...  Maybe some cold... 
[02:34:00]  Cold climbing outside.  It's cold outside.  All right, let's go.  Let's go.  Okay.  As I pick myself up  off the floor...  Yeah, you gotta start there.  I grab the wood  that is now  used to be my rocking chair  and I make it into kindling.  Ah.  Knowing that soon  the whistle will blow  and my hot cocoa  will be ready to drink.  Oh.  Ooh.  Crackling fire.  I hear a knock at the door.  Is it the woodpecker?  Is it a friend?  Is it a foe?  You can count that out. 
[02:34:30]  The intervention group.  Woodpecker's all right to fall.  It's the pizza guy.  That's good.  Creepy Craig.  The pizza guy.  Ah, shit.  My voice.  I gotta stop.  Is that a funny one?  No, keep storytelling.  We like this.  You found your niche. 
[02:35:00]  Yes.  As I walk...  Knock at the door.  Knock at the door.  As I walk across the floor,  you can hear the creaks.  Yes.  Okay.  I see the water in the glass move.  I'm calling you Steakspear.  All right.  I want to hear the story.  I apologize.  How does the story go?  You're walking across the floor.  Oh, shit.  We got the visual.  Walk across the floor. 
[02:35:30]  You're going to open the door?  I don't know.  I go to the door.  Oh, okay.  And I do not look out the peak hole.  Oh.  Because I know in my heart,  in my heart's heart,  in the hearts of hearts of hearts,  that it is a friend.  I open the door quickly,  and the rush of cold air  hits my bald head.  Oh, well, okay.  And I look to the left and to the right,  and nobody is there.  Oh.  Nobody is there.  Don't run.  Don't kids.  Foe. 
[02:36:00]  Foe.  Foe, woodpecker.  Where'd the woodpecker go?  I thought you already said it was a friend.  He knew it in his heart of hearts,  but then he's opening it,  and he was wrong.  Oh.  He's looking left and right.  All right.  The cold air hit his bald head.  Yeah.  I shut the door.  I go back.  I hear...  The faint whistle of my hot cocoa being ready.  Oh.  I run back into the kitchen.  Oh, what's left of it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Someone has tricked me. 
[02:36:30]  They knocked on my front door to get my misdirection.  Oh.  So that they could go into the kitchen  and take all of my food and crumpets.  Crumpets?  The sounds of the tractor trailer backing up  should have tipped me off.  I see the red lights of a truck leaving.  It was not a woodpecker at all. 
[02:37:00]  It was a Mack truck backing up into my house.  The only thing they left me was a whistling kettle.  Oh.  That was whistling in my face.  I turned the gas down.  The whistle slowly...  Subsided?  Yes.  Slowly subsided.  You can play along with this story.  The whistle slowly subsided.  The whistle... 
[02:37:30]  Hold on.  Now, because the hole in the wall from the truck,  the cold air rushes through my bones,  into my eyes, and out my ears.  Because there's nothing inside to stop it.  I pour myself a cup of hot cocoa as quickly as possible. 
[02:38:00]  I put my slippers on,  my robe that my grandmother once made me,  and my mittens...  Out of a ship sail.  I'm sorry, Poppy.  It's terrible.  I know you hate the apology more than the insult.  I hate...  Don't apologize.  I wrap the sail around my chest once.  I squeeze to get the button on. 
[02:38:30]  I put the mittens that are barely made on my hands.  Oh, that's nice.  I run to the fire,  and I stoke it with the rocking chair  that is now broken because of my weight.  Oh, shit!  The fire warms my bones,  warms my heart,  warms my eyes,  and I realize  that I'm alone  in my house.  With a gaping hole in the side, yes. 
[02:39:00]  With a hole in the side.  Sitting by a fire  with an almost understandable urge  to put an apple in my own mouth.  And I realize I have no apples.  Or crumpets.  Or tea.  You've been robbed.  Is that how the story ends?  I have no chair.  I have no food.  I have no friends.  I have no foe.  But what do you have?  I have a woodpecker  in the distance.  Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick. 
[02:39:30]  Gently tap in the tire  of Anne Frankfurter.  He will just want to put food  in everything.  I wonder why.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Ernest Heavyweight's coming in, too.  Ernest Heavyweight.  That's a good one.  I officially didn't make a fat joke.  I like it.  Daddy liked my story.  I like it.  I can see that on book radio.  I'm a good storyteller  and I'm a professional whistler.  Right, Sam?  Pretty good.  That's right. 
[02:40:00]  Do you know how to whistle?  Like Steve the Whistler?  I actually was a professional whistler  from 1997 to 1999.  I was a world champion.  Two years?  Can you give us a little bit?  Give us a little.  I can try.  When are you going to whistle?  Well, I'll whistle.  Do you whistle patriotic stuff?  This is what I won in 1999 with, okay?  All right.  He won the competition doing this. 
[02:40:30]  We're blessed to have him today.  Oh.  I know this song. 
[02:41:00]  It's like a drum solo.  What is he doing?  Wow.  Oh.  All right.  You know what?  You won a competition in 1999.  Yeah, because I...  What title?  The grand master champion?  I was the champion whistler of 1999 of the world.  Damn. 
[02:41:30]  The world.  I beat a Korean.  Damn.  Jean-Kwankwank.  Very hard for them to whistle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking bullshit.  Oh.  Chipper.  What's the matter, Chip?  Number one.  Number one.  This...  To ask why we fight...  Yeah.  I actually wrote a couple of my songs.  My grandfather.  This guy's a punk right here.  Hey, Steve the Whistler at this thing?  I...  This is the guy I beat.  I don't know.  He sounds pretty good. 
[02:42:00]  What?  What are they putting typewriting sounds in it?  I don't know.  Stupid.  This guy's...  He's a friend of mine.  He's a friend of mine.  Ha ha.  I gave him that part right there I helped him with.  This is terrible. 
[02:42:30]  I can't whistle.  Oh, poor Jimmy can't whistle.  That's right.  This bitch there.  She cheats.  Yeah, that's from...  A cartoon I did for Disney years ago.  That was when the birds came out.  Oh, look at this idiot.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Where's Steve the Whistler?  He's Russian.  Jeffrey Ross.  Ha ha ha.  It's like...  This is a guy with Pinocchio's. 
[02:43:00]  Ah, I could have danced all night.  Oh, you know the song.  She's got good lungs for whistler.  She's got giant tits.  Everybody can whistle, but it makes it...  It's fascinating that it's coming out of your human body without using an instrument.  Yeah, but you have a million instruments to make it sound good.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, the three whistling tenors.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  These guys are hacks.  God.  They're hacks.  Oh, they're all whistling now on stage.  It's like a whistling fucking jam session.  Yeah.  I wasn't there that year.  Bobby, can you give us just a little more to break?  Yeah.  Because we've got Big Ang coming up with her new book, Bigger is Better.  Whistling's terrible.  Yeah, this is a song my grandfather wrote.  It's a number called Put This In Your Mouth, Son. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, my God.  Bobby's going to be at Levity Live at West Nyack, New York, in the Palisades Mall tonight through Sunday.  And Jimmy's leaving us in a little while to go out there to California.  Irvine.  Irvine, California.  Improv.  All weekend long, right, Jimmy?  Friday, Saturday?  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Tonight you were performing out there.  This is what the seagull sounds like when it's deflating.  That's funny. 
[02:44:30]  Big Ang's next.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  The kids are running wild because school's out, but cool's in.  No reason to get antsy.  Yeah, where are you getting them in your pouncy?  It's Valley Gym.  Oh, my God.  California is trendsetting again with all the coolest slang and wackiest situations.  That is so grody. 
[02:45:00]  Hey, Jim.  Did you, like, hear that Sheila was totes making out with Brad?  Oh, make me want to barf.  Tag along as the crew lives, laughs, but also learns.  Uh, like, oh, my God.  Have you heard what's going on in Uganda?  Joseph Coney is full of baloney.  Jim is the queen of the valley, and in the valley, we don't take guff.  Well, maybe you can't hear this.  Oops, turn it up.  Middle finger time. 
[02:45:30]  Like, that's my grandmother.  Oh, my God.  You're so old, you should call dirt by name or something.  And a special appearance by President Ronald Reagan.  Yes, hello, well, whatever.  You're, uh, grody, yes.  Gag me with a spoon, mommy.  It's Valley Gym, coming very soon to a theater near you.  Well, how am I supposed to talk?  Like, with my butt or something?  On the next American War Stories, Battleground, Iraq, Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant 
[02:46:00]  realizes no man can prepare for war.  We thought we were going to starve, so we, like, brought, like, little, like, bars and  stuff, like, well, there's going to be no food.  There was more, I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  There was, you go to the buffet, there's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza, ice  cream.  You could walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and sunnies as you 
[02:46:30]  want.  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one, and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more.  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly.  I broke my knee, man.  On the next American War Stories. 
[02:47:00]  In a world where one vigilante engineer disregards the law of the land.  Fuck you and your rules.  Only the strong will survive.  I'm a much bigger man than you are.  Marcelino Centeno is.  We're going to fight.  Livewire.  I'm not afraid of your information.  Engineer or no engineer.  Livewire looks to take down the bad guys at any cost.  You have a difficult personality, and you're an asshole.  But you're our engineer.  You could drop dead right now. 
[02:47:30]  I wouldn't give a fuck.  Whining and complaining get you nowhere with Livewire.  I'm still waiting for a Christmas dinner from five years ago.  That's exactly my point, you stupid fuck.  Little dick motherfucker.  Couldn't even get it hard.  No action adventure will get your blood boiling like this.  Strap in, folks.  This is where it gets really exciting.  Because I'm the truth-sayer.  Livewire.  Coming soon to a theater near you. 
[02:48:00]  Sirius XM.  And now, the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Bob Kelly is discussing something with Jimmy Warren right now. 
[02:48:30]  Hey, Sam.  What are you talking to Sam about?  Aw, you're getting Bobby all jealous.  You're not into Sam anymore, right?  Because he's a man now?  Remember when he was a little boy?  Yeah, he's probably ordering some green eggs and ham or something.  His hair even looks like a Dr. Seuss character.  Dr. Seuss.  Shut the fuck up.  Oh.  Shut the fuck up.  Bobby, I actually like Sam's new hair.  I like his hair down.  Bobby, I got a treat for you. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, what's up?  We're waiting for the Big Ange to show up.  Yeah.  Bigger is better.  Her new book, Real Life Wisdom from the No Drama Mama.  Bob Kelly's going to be at Levitie Live, West Nyack, New York, in the Palisades Mall.  But I want to show you something.  I want to see it, too.  Could you close your eyes until we're ready for you, Bobby?  Yeah, sure.  What is that?  What's that, Bobby?  Sam's finding it.  Do you remember which one?  I don't know what that is.  Is that your pass to get up here?  All right.  Bobby, let me see.  If you will, please.  Just look at that. 
[02:49:30]  That's a little maggot.  Yeah, a little maggot.  It's got a nose.  Where is it?  Oh!  Bobby.  Bobby.  It's an Indian guy.  Don't fuck yourself, Opie.  I'm not doing it.  Look at that.  What's wrong with you?  Fuck that at my throat.  You're going to fuck my throat up, you fucking cuck sucker.  I don't know what that is.  You're going to fuck up your throat?  I'm not looking at it.  I don't give a fuck.  I got six shows this weekend.  I'm not sabotaging that to look at that stupid shit.  All right.  We went to the Levity website. 
[02:50:00]  Look, it's...  Yeah.  I don't get it.  What do you think?  This is 87?  Do you want to see the one where there's nobs and the gums?  You're on WAF again?  All right.  We went...  Can you look at least...  No.  Look, it is really gone.  I don't give a shit.  It's not that bad.  I don't care.  It's a nose.  I don't care.  I can't.  Listen to me.  I really can't.  I can't.  I'll tell you what it is.  I don't understand it.  Look, see, it's fine.  Look.  You're out of your mind.  Look.  No, I'm not puking.  Look, I'm...  I don't care, Opie.  That's just a nostril.  I don't care.  Fucking A.  There's a whole...  God damn it.  I can't look at this. 
[02:50:30]  There's a whole nest of maggots in this guy's nose.  Yeah, but is it there because...  I love the mic flag.  Why is that there?  Is he dead?  Wait.  He's looking at his throat, too.  He's looking at his throat.  Yeah, good.  I'm looking at a mic flag right in front of my face.  See, the throat is fine.  I'm looking at Anthony looking at a mic flag.  I'm not looking.  Bobby, you got throat stuff.  It's so weird.  The video's done.  It's maggots in a person's nose.  They're way up in the...  What happened to you?  Let's play trust.  What happened to you?  Let's play trust.  The video's done.  Here you go.  Ready? 
[02:51:00]  Do you trust me?  Not at all.  That's the worst thing I've ever seen.  Let's just fast forward to five minutes from now.  Ask me if you...  Would you get those, Anthony?  Never.  With boogers on them?  Ask me...  Ask me...  No!  Ten years from now.  We're in a time machine.  Ten years from now.  Do you trust me, Bobby?  Never.  Never.  Still?  You're old.  You're on your deathbed.  Thanks.  And you're holding a cross, and you're saying the Our Father.  And now ask me.  Do you trust me, Bobby?  Absolutely not.  No.  Would you eat one of those?  Like, imagine fishing your finger in there, and you'd have maggots crawling in a booger  film.  I'd use one for fly fishing. 
[02:51:30]  It's a booger film.  Did you audition for that?  I'd take...  What about the one under the ghost?  There's a whole nest of maggots.  You could see them all crammed up against the back of the silence.  I would take one of those and put it on a hook and catch a nice rainbow.  Oh, there you go.  How does this fuck up your throat, though?  Well, if I puke, when I puke, when I throw up, the acid comes up and shreds your throat.  Yeah.  I won't be able to talk.  I used to do acid.  Fair enough.  You did?  It's done.  It's done.  I can't even look at it.  It's done.  It's done.  Oh, God.  Fucking get that off.  What is that?  Oh, it's just a bot fly. 
[02:52:00]  A bot fly.  I hate bot flies.  Oh, the bot flies are the worst.  Fucking bot fly.  That's the one that has a hole in your head, and it comes out, and you've got to tape it  shut to kill it.  Ah, tape it.  Something like that.  You vacillate it.  Right?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't like bot flies.  I don't want a bot fly.  I don't think I got a bot fly.  No.  How about I'd divorce my wife if she had a bot fly?  Oh, who wouldn't?  I literally would take the ring off her finger while she was sleeping.  She'd wake up like in meatballs, the counselor, out in the lake on a bed. 
[02:52:30]  Or in her bot fly.  Oh, I've had it with the bot fly.  That's so bizarre.  No, Bobby, you good?  Parasites.  I'm not good.  I'm trying to show you something.  I know.  It's from your guy, Dr. Steve.  He's on your podcast network.  Dr. Steve.  I love Dr. Steve.  I thought we could share a little bit.  You know, I have to get eye surgery.  What?  I have a pucker on the back of my eye.  What's a pucker on the back of your eye?  It's an asshole.  I woke up one day.  I couldn't read the cable box time.  It was my right eye.  You don't need a new eye.  You need an education.  It's because you couldn't speak. 
[02:53:00]  I get it.  I get it.  I got it.  I don't like that.  Time jokes are stretching it, though.  What's going on with you?  You got a pucker on the back of your eye.  Could you fucking get that off?  I really can't do the show.  What, the hole in the toe?  That's kind of cool.  All of it.  I can't do it.  What's that top one, Sam?  I can't do it.  It's a pucker succubus.  What's the bun under that?  I don't know what the fuck it is.  Oh, this is easy, Bob.  You can do this one.  Opie, look at me.  Look at me.  Yeah?  Look at me.  Yeah?  It's not going to happen.  You really, you really.  But it's a transsexual. 
[02:53:30]  You like transsexuals.  Well, now you get my curiosity peaked.  I swear it's a transsexual.  No.  It doesn't matter.  Bobby?  No.  No, no.  What was the one other, Sam?  It's disgusting.  It's disgusting, Bobby.  You're so decent.  It's sad that you're decent at him.  Look at the pussy.  That's a nice pussy.  Wait.  All right.  Let's make a deal.  Can you look at it?  I won't look at it.  Can you look at a pussy?  No.  I am not doing it because I can't fucking.  Vaginal exam.  I don't.  Look at me.  Actually.  Look at my eyes, stupid.  Stupid.  Asshole exam.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  What are they doing?  Bobby. 
[02:54:00]  Look at my eyes.  You like it.  You like it.  Look at my eyes.  Get those fucking pale German eyes.  Look at me.  It's just an asshole.  See, Jimmy.  I don't trust anybody in this room.  Holy fuck.  That is so goddamn.  I'm looking at Anthony's face.  You're fucking fucking this whole thing.  Oh, because you so had him.  He was ready to look.  I was going to fuck.  Oh, boy.  What is that?  The asshole looks like a tongue.  It's moving on its own.  Oh, wow.  Come on, Bobby.  This is not something you see every day. 
[02:54:30]  I'm not ruining my throat for you.  Don't look at Anthony anymore.  I could give a fuck.  It's a nice pussy, though.  Jimmy, it's good, right?  I could give a fuck.  He's sewing something in the asshole.  It's like a fissure being fixed.  It's not that bad.  I thought it was a bug.  Not that bad, really.  Honestly, look to your right.  Nah, you're out of your mind.  I think you could do this one, Bobby.  You're out of your mind.  I'm encouraging you.  I think you could do this.  You're out of your mind.  Look, I think you could do this.  Nah, you're crazy.  Don't try to pep talk me, Dad.  You're simply...  Try to play on my I don't have a father routine.  What kind of surgery is it?  I just want to be taught things. 
[02:55:00]  I want pep talks.  Curiosity isn't getting me on this one?  Nah, I'm not doing it.  If my throat was fine, I'd play along with your hijinks.  Yeah, hijinks.  But other than that, you can go fuck yourself.  You and my...  It looks like a tongue.  You and your fucking...  No, it's bleeding.  White lady cheeks.  Nah, it's bleeding a little.  Just want to warn you, it's bleeding a little.  Are you okay with blood before you look?  I don't like your cheeks, Ope.  I want you to fix your white lady cheeks.  I got cheekbones.  I know.  I don't like your high fucking cheekbones.  I might be from way up north, I think.  Yeah, you have... 
[02:55:30]  I think I might have some fucking Viking.  You have Viking blood in you?  Or some kind of Eskimo or something.  But you're not a hunter.  I've got something going on there that...  You're not the guy that went away on war.  You're the guy that stayed back...  Oh, thanks, Bobby.  ...and planned the war.  Thanks.  Oh, I can plan a war.  Yeah, it's not bad.  Oh, that's not bad.  I thought I had to do the cooking with the ladies or something.  No, you're not a cook.  You were gathering nuts and berries.  Yeah, you didn't go fight the war.  My biggest problem is I don't know my mom's side of the family at all.  Right.  Do that thing on the internet.  You know, we were hanging out as a family yesterday.  We were trying to figure out what my mom's mom's name is, and we don't know. 
[02:56:00]  How fucked up is that?  That's bad.  That's weird.  Because I'm having a daughter, and I don't want to...  That's great.  I don't want to name her after this fucking cunt.  Are you...  Wow.  Wow.  Which one?  You don't even want to take a chance.  You might hit it.  No.  Just don't name your daughter Gertie or Ethel.  My mom's mom...  Gertie.  My mom's mom.  I don't call her grandma.  She never was.  She's the precious brood.  Yeah.  She has a first name.  None of us know what it is. 
[02:56:30]  How weird is that?  That's weird.  How did that...  And I don't want my daughter to be by accident named after her.  And who is that?  That's your grandmother?  No.  She's my mom's mom.  Your mom's mom.  You could do the math and figure out it's a grandma.  Biologically, yeah.  So, you're having a daughter.  Yeah.  Are you excited about having a little girl?  No.  Why?  Yeah, I actually...  Oh.  Sorry.  I'm excited.  No.  I'm excited.  That was the worst day of fucking Opie's life. 
[02:57:00]  I'm excited, but...  I'm going to a pool party.  Where?  Oh, Jesus.  Uncle, aunt?  Believe me, there's always going to be assholes like me around.  They might play this tape pack.  Of course, I'm excited, but I think...  I'm going to stay over.  Anthony's too drunk to drive me home, Dad.  At least I'll be way too old to give a fuck at that point.  Uncle Jimmy's here, too.  We're all in the hot tub.  Oh, my God.  We're going to watch a movie.  Oh, no.  We're playing fucking...  It's called Casino.  He said there's a good part with Pesci in a trailer. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm excited, but...  Fuck.  It would suck.  If she came home doing movie lines from Godfather, you'd punch her in her face.  As guys, we know all the moves.  I'm just thinking...  Oh, God.  I want to have a daughter more than a boy if I have a kid.  Really?  Yeah, I'm afraid my anger and rage will come out on the guy.  You know what I mean?  I know that I'm better with women.  What?  I'm better with women.  Guys want guys for their first child.  I don't. 
[02:58:00]  There's not a guy alive that doesn't want a son first.  I don't.  First, yeah.  May your first child be a feminine child.  Yeah.  Yeah, you kind of want that kid that's going to guard the...  Also going to guard the daughter.  The Kelly Estate.  The gang.  Yeah, yeah.  I want a girl.  You do.  I want a girl.  I don't want a guy.  You want a daughter.  Yeah, I don't want to get into that shit with my...  Oh, you don't know.  Sapphire.  I don't fucking know.  This woman merits you turning off all the fucking TV.  Is she here?  Is she coming in?  Is she here now?  I'll pop right over. 
[02:58:30]  Bobby, this is...  Call the big gang.  What's up?  She's in the bathroom taking the duty.  You still got the original case for the iPad.  It's a dump.  This is the iPad 1.  I got to go.  You have the iPad 1?  Yeah.  Who's going?  I got to go.  Where are you going?  Irvine, California.  Hey, I got a flight to catch.  I got a show tonight.  Got a show on Friday.  How are you getting there?  Going to take a plane, zip, zip.  You're going to tunnel?  We're going to take...  No, I'm going to take a plane.  Burrow.  Bobby. 
[02:59:00]  Like a mall.  He just pops his head out in a mall parking lot.  It's the wrong place.  I'm in Texas.  I got to go.  Back down.  Can I defend my iPad at least?  Yeah, God.  The screen...  I mean, the screen doesn't look bad.  There's nothing different about...  There's no retina display, my friend.  There's nothing different about this.  Oh.  That was a good move, though.  That was a good move.  You got to give him.  Dude, you got to give him.  He stepped up his fucking game.  You got to give him.  He had some disgusting...  I like it.  ...playing on his iPad.  He should have shut the volume off.  I heard the volume, and it triggered me off at the last second.  You did look. 
[02:59:30]  That wasn't bad.  That was really good.  To look at another gross video.  Yeah, that was fucking gross.  Well, it's just kind of like a whitehead coming out of an old man's nose.  This is what we do to make him not make me want to puke.  I threw up on him once.  My kid threw up yesterday.  We're showing him disgusting.  I say, fucking bring it.  My puke and your kid's puke is totally different.  You want to puke.  Seriously.  Bob's puke tastes like cum.  I was just about to say that, but then I was like, why would I make fun of myself?  Let's negotiate where you puke on me.  I was wondering, if girls swallow cum, does it come out in their piss or shit? 
[03:00:00]  I think it just gets absorbed into that horrid system.  You know what I mean?  I was like, what is that?  Does it come out like an X-Men shit where it's just clear?  Is that a solid or a liquid?  Or does it come out in their piss?  How does it cum come out?  Bobby?  Yes, sir.  I'm not going to let you get the best of me.  What do you want to puke on me?  Let's negotiate this.  On his dick.  Again?  Sorry.  I'm not going to puke on you.  That would make me...  Get off me, fucking Edgar. 
[03:00:30]  No, you said I could take your puke.  Just not in the face.  I'll let you puke right here.  That's just...  Upper chest, so I have to smell it.  This is just weird.  It is weird, but I don't want you to fucking think you got one eye.  That you had the sentence...  Stop touching me, Edgar.  That you just said, I'll let you puke on my upper chest.  Here she comes.  Bring her right in.  Bring her right in.  All right, move over there, Bobby.  Big Ange.  How you doing, Big Ange?  Ooh, that's a lot of guys.  God damn, Big Ange.  Yeah, take a seat.  Take a seat right there.  We're live on the air.  Take a seat right there.  Wow, nice small ass. 
[03:01:00]  There you go.  I didn't realize your ass was...  Oh, sorry.  Look at it.  She's got a nice ass.  Because the boobies are big, so sometimes you think the rest is big.  But no, it's nice.  That's a compliment.  I know it sounds a little weird.  Hello.  Big Ange, bigger is better.  In studio.  That's Bob Kelly to your right.  Hi, Bobby.  Nice to meet you.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  This is too early for me.  It is.  It's early for us.  And we've been doing this a long time.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  So what the hey-ho?  What are you up to?  You got the show?  People are watching it, right?  Well, today was on Channel 11 News at 8 o'clock this morning.  How did that work out?  I'm on the roll since 7 this morning.  Wow.  It was good.  Yeah?  Yeah?  I had fun.  Now, how did you get this show?  His voice.  Oh, oh, the show.  No, the show.  How did you get this?  His voice?  I don't know.  Now, you were a spinoff from?  Mob Wives.  Mob Wives.  Right.  So now-  I was only supposed to be on Mob Wives for six episodes.  Don't ask me what happened. 
[03:02:00]  I won't ask you nothing.  What was your connection to Mob Wives?  Like, who- how is your-  Don't use the word connection.  Jennifer Graziano came to me and said, would you like to try out six episodes?  I said, okay, I'll try it.  But family-wise, who were you related to that made you-  A Mob Wives.  A Mob Wives.  Oh, my uncle Sally Dogs.  Sally Dogs?  Sally Dogs.  I know Sally Dogs.  Hey, Sally Dogs.  I know Sally Dogs.  What kind of hijinks and shenanigans was he pulling?  He was into some things.  What did he do?  Some things?  Yeah, well, he was in jail for 22 years. 
[03:02:30]  He died two years ago.  Oh, banana.  In jail.  Oh, did he, huh?  Sorry to hear.  Yeah.  Did you really know him?  Yeah.  Sally Dogs.  He's a legend.  Yeah.  Did he-  What's his?  Did he off a few people?  You don't know Sally Dogs?  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  So then, I guess you stood out so much on the Mob Wives.  So, this is how it happens.  I did the six episodes.  From there, I stood 17.  From there, I got a spinoff. 
[03:03:00]  From there, I got a book.  And now, possibly a movie.  I don't know what's happening here.  A movie?  Now, what's your-  Jeez.  I love the voice.  What's the life like now?  What are you doing now?  Chaos.  Insane.  Yeah?  You should only see what it's like walking in the streets.  A lot of people recognize you now?  Everywhere I go, all morning.  Really?  They want to take pictures?  Everything. 
[03:03:30]  Do people look at your chest ever?  Do you get mad if somebody looks at your chest?  No.  Here, look.  Those are giant tits.  Wow, those are giant.  Holy moly.  Yeah.  Those are like almost-  Almost, uh, I'll go with footballs.  I said they're like-  I was going to say basketball.  They're a little smaller than basketball.  Are those fake?  They're more like a honeydew.  Honeydew.  Honeydew melons.  Whoa.  Big eggs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like honeydew melons.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So-  I think sweet.  So now, at what age did you start getting cosmetic surgery? 
[03:04:00]  Like-  25.  25.  What made you decide at 25 you wanted to start doing things?  Oh, my tits were in my waist, I decided.  At 25 they were?  That's crazy.  Well, I had the baby, and that's what happened.  Oh, okay.  Everything falls.  Everything just fell, so you decided to bring it back up.  Bring it back.  Has your voice always been like this?  Yes, it's terrible.  I smoked a brown cigarette.  35 years.  Oh, my God.  Is that a code for a black man?  I'm trying to quit.  I want to quit.  I'm going to go to the doctor to quit.  Yeah? 
[03:04:30]  Why don't you use the patch?  That's what I did.  I did it, too.  I did that, too.  Didn't work.  Didn't work, huh?  Didn't work.  What's going to work, you think?  They said I'm going to get something in the ear.  Something in the ear.  Oh, Captain, they put creatures in our bodies.  What can they put in the ear?  Listen, when I went on Extra the other day.  Years ago, it would have been a 38.  I went on Extra with AJ the other day.  Yeah, Benza.  And he said he's sending me to a doctor.  He smoked 23 years, and he quit.  So I'm going to try it. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, man.  How much do you smoke a day?  Like a pack.  Oh, okay.  But 35 years, the same brand.  Are you married?  What do you smoke?  Benson and Hedges?  What, do you smoke more?  Yeah.  Wait, where's your husband?  Your husband's here?  Where's your husband?  More.  Do you know how hard it is to get them?  Nobody cares that.  No one has more anymore.  What the fuck?  Every one of my stores in my neighborhood get them for me.  Oh, they got them just for you.  For Big Ang.  We got them more for you.  We get them perfect for you.  We got them more.  Yeah, of course.  Right?  Of course. 
[03:05:30]  We can't see Ange's eyes.  Yeah.  What kind of eyes you got?  You got the bangs in your eyes.  There you go.  Nice eyes.  This Big Ang is all right, man.  Where's the husband?  He's in there.  In there.  In there.  Do you guys fight a lot or do you get along well?  No, we don't fight.  I don't fight.  You don't fight?  I just throw his ass out.  Ah, there you go.  How long have you been together?  There's no fight.  How long have you been together?  I'm married three years.  Three years?  And I was separated too.  Wait, so what does he do?  Is he...  He's a sanitation worker.  Oh, right. 
[03:06:00]  There you go.  I need a pension.  That's a waste management.  Waste management.  I need a pension.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wasn't getting one with a wise guy.  No, we speak...  No.  What you get is a debt letter.  Oh, shit.  But we speak that language.  We understand what's going on, baby.  Hey, what are you going to do?  Did you grow up in Brooklyn?  Ebony U.  Ebony U.  Brooklyn and the Hur.  Yeah, I think I lived on Avenue U for a little while.  Yeah.  But maybe eight, nine years ago.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:06:30]  Where?  In Brooklyn.  That is so the new process.  Yeah, I'm trying to remember the cross, but...  No, it's a pretty long game.  Yeah, it is a long-ass avenue.  What's your poison?  Do you drink at all?  Do you put down a few?  Oh, no, not me.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, yeah.  She rolls her eyes.  What do you like?  You own a bar.  What do you think?  You like a little wine?  You drink a little red wine, right?  I drink red wine.  I drink Patron.  Patron.  I drink espresso martinis.  I drink anything.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I drink anything.  Where's your bar? 
[03:07:00]  I'm drinking Jameson.  I don't know.  Oh, shit.  Where's your bar?  Where's your bar?  Staten Island.  Of course it is.  Drunken monkey.  All right.  You know what?  We're New Yorkers, and I don't know anything about Staten Island.  No one knows anything about Staten Island.  It's the last bastion of a bunch of fucking...  No one goes there unless you live there.  You know, Staten Island comes to my bar.  Huh?  What do you mean?  I mean, people are coming from all over the world to my bar now.  Yeah.  It's very popular.  That's kind of cool.  Staten Island has the hottest chicks.  Yeah.  I mean, fucking...  Like, what the fuck? 
[03:07:30]  I did a club out there, Uncle Vinny's, in the theater out there.  I used to go to the Starbucks before the show, and it was just hot chick after fucking  smoking hot chick.  Yeah, big hair.  Ugh.  All these little Italian girls.  Exactly.  Yeah, but some of them were a little old.  It didn't matter.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Did you have a good shot with them?  No, I don't have a shot with anybody.  Oh, shit.  How about a lot older, she says.  How old is she?  Do you have a daughter or a son?  I have a daughter.  She'll be 28.  Hot.  Oh, cool.  Yeah?  She married?  Very good looking.  28. 
[03:08:00]  So, Ange is up there.  You don't look like you're up there, Ange.  Oh, jeez.  I have a son, 23.  Very good looking.  So, you're a 28-year-old daughter.  Let's stick with her.  She's not married.  She's a school teacher in Marine Park in Brooklyn.  All right.  Look at you.  Everyone's sticking around Brooklyn.  Does she have the big personality like you?  Oh, Staten Island.  She lives with me.  Really?  Well, teacher salary.  Of course she lives with Big Ange.  Are the girls jealous from the other show?  She's also a bartender in my bar on Friday nights.  Ange, are the girls jealous from the other show because you're such a hit now? 
[03:08:30]  They say they're not.  Oh, they're not.  Yeah.  But they are.  They are.  You still keep in touch with them at all?  Yeah.  I was actually with Drita yesterday.  We've had them on.  Drita.  Drita.  We've had them on.  What's this book about it?  Are we going to learn anything cool?  Probably not.  Bigger is better.  She don't need no money.  That's the book.  Big Ange.  Bigger is better.  It's just fun.  It's about when I was arrested.  What happened there? 
[03:09:00]  Give us a little arrest story for you.  I figured you'd like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Why were you arrested?  What do you think?  I would say D-Wee.  What?  D-Wee.  Let's guess.  D-Wee.  D-Wee.  Drunk driving.  Assault.  No.  Assault and battery.  What do you think I want to buy?  Get drunk driving?  That's true.  All right.  All right.  Assault and battery.  No.  No assault?  Cocaine.  Oh, shit.  D-Line Coke.  You are hardcore.  Nice. 
[03:09:30]  I did house arrest.  Yeah.  For how long?  How much time?  Four months.  The rest.  But we'll keep it in the colored areas.  Let them lose their souls.  They're animals anyway.  Right?  He's funny.  He's funny.  He should go to one of his parties over at his house.  Oh, they're hilarious.  We don't even know where we live.  It's what house.  I'm out of Long Island.  Oh, you don't like Long Island?  What's wrong with Long Island?  I'm always getting lost there.  You're always getting lost over there.  There's only one way in and out.  I don't know those streets.  I'm confused.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's one way.  All right.  My son is actually, I'm going to start going to Long Island. 
[03:10:00]  Oh.  He's in a drug program in Long Island.  Oh, yeah?  The Phoenix.  Was he having trouble with the drugs?  Yeah, huh?  Oh, sorry.  Do you feel guilty about that at all?  Maybe it could have been, you know.  No, don't take bills.  No?  I didn't say I was taking the drugs.  I said I was selling the drugs.  She was smart.  How long ago did you get arrested?  Because when you take them, you'll be a loser.  Yeah.  When you sell them, you'll make the moolah.  Right. 
[03:10:30]  Holy shit.  How long ago did you get arrested for it?  Oh, 11 years ago.  Oh, all right.  That's the while ago.  You know, things were bad.  You got to do what you got to do.  You got to do what you got to do, you know?  You got to take care of your family.  They're not going to take care of you.  Come on, Karen.  We're alone here.  They're not going to take care of us.  Hey, I got a question.  How are the lips?  Does that hurt to do?  I did the lips 12 years ago.  But does it hurt to get injections?  It does.  Fucking hurts.  Does it?  Really?  What are they, just injections?  It goes right in your eyes.  Holy shit.  Really?  Yeah.  You have to keep getting it for the rest of your life? 
[03:11:00]  No, I got it.  No, I said, let me just do it all at once.  Give me five.  What is five, man?  Holy shit.  Five tubes.  Five tubes.  People get like one.  I'm like, give me a little here, a little here.  I go, what's that going to do?  You're wasting your money.  You got to bang it out all at once.  Five tubes.  Five tubes.  I left the place.  I left the place.  I was at home like that.  Holy shit.  Black and blue.  Well, my lips were this big.  I was like, what the fuck?  I look like Daffy Duck.  What am I going to do? 
[03:11:30]  Oh.  Three days later.  And I was going to have my 40th birthday.  Oh, man.  In Staten Island.  Of course.  I was like panicking, ice packs, everything.  But this is it.  12 years later, still here.  See, it worked.  Now, do you have to get little booster shots every so often?  That's been like that for 12 years?  You're good.  Holy mother of pearl.  I hope they don't go away.  You like it?  Yeah.  She likes the big lips.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're sexy.  I like them, too.  I like big lips.  Now, you rather have lips like this or like that? 
[03:12:00]  Little bird lips?  Oh, he sees the teeth.  You can't even imitate small lips, though.  Look at you, you just went like, and you still have more lips.  You know, when they have no lips, and the lips like stuck to their gum.  Oh, man, you don't want that.  I rather have this.  Bobby, you got a question for Big Edge?  No, I was just, when she was talking about little lips,  little Jimmy started licking his lips like I do.  I like little lips.  I got little lips.  I like lips, too.  Does Jimmy have big lips?  Does Jimmy have big lips?  They're nice when you gotta kiss.  Look at Jimmy's lips.  I have small lips.  Jimmy's been known to have the sexiest fucking...  I'm standing to the top.  No, I purse.  Oh, Jimmy.  You need to have five tubes. 
[03:12:30]  Look at him purse.  Ew.  When I make the Percy face, girls like it.  Huh?  They are very little.  He's got little lips.  They look like they're drawn.  You know, men do get it.  Five tubes, Jimmy.  What do you think?  You got five tubes?  I should get five tubes, but only in the top.  I should leave the bottom as it is.  You look like a platypus.  What else about this book, Big Edge?  We gotta sell some books for you.  So you got arrested.  You better sell my books.  You got the whole story about you getting arrested in there.  I talk about...  Short chapters.  I like that. 
[03:13:00]  It's nice.  What about some of that, uh, your, uh, uncle there?  Some of that mobbed up shit.  Got any of that in there?  Let's not talk about that.  Well, it's got any in there.  That's okay.  It's no secret.  He was a legend, man.  I think I talk about...  Yeah, he was a good guy.  Yeah?  I think I talk about, like, when I went out with Wise Guys, they bought me million dollar  houses.  Oh, nice.  Really?  Now I gotta beg for a Chanel bag.  What the fuck?  I go, not used to this shit.  You're making your old money.  They bought me businesses and houses and furs and cars.

How could that be good?  Mafia guys know how to take care of people.  Oh, they certainly do.  Hey, I worked at a golf...  I say it a lot.  I worked at a golf course with a lot of mob guys.  They were way cooler and nicer and took care of us more than the legit guys.  Yeah, of course.  They're cheap. 
[03:14:00]  They're fucking the worst.  The ones that carry wallets are very cheap.  Only like guys that have rubber beans.  Sorry!  Oh, yeah?  Put the bean on the outside.  Mingy.  Yeah.  If you're pulling out a wallet, I ain't going out with you.  Do they keep receipts for tax purposes?  But I do lately.  Oh, shit.  I got receipts.  Oh, well, you know, now you can write that off.  You have to.  You write that off.  I have.  Government allows you that. 
[03:14:30]  That's all I do is shop.  I need to close the show.  Right.  The big show.  Clothes are a tough one to write off.  Clothes are a tough one.  She's in entertainment.  Unless you're a clown or unless it's something you can only wear at.  A clown like I make you laugh?  Then you can only wear that for you.  Of course.  It's great.  Listen.  You need to wear different clothes every day because you're on camera.  Right.  See?  You got to buy a lot of shit.  Oh, you got legit.  You're legit.  You're legit as far as that goes.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't you worry about that.

So it talks about all my friends talking the book.  My daughter, my son, my sisters and brothers.  So you had everyone else write the book for you.  No, little chapters.

Don't make me fucking prove it.  Listen to me.  Some people do.  The sauce with the pig's feet.  Oh, man.  Oh, that's good.  How does Bobby walk?  Big Ange.  He pissed off Jimmy.  He's leaving.  This is funny.  I have a flight to catch.  You guys do.  I loved him talking to you, though.  It was fun.  That's what he says.  I enjoyed you very much. 
[03:16:00]  Do you have your lucky hat?  Oh!  Do you have your lucky hat, Jim?  A little nice, Peck.  Where are you going?  I don't want your husband to knock my teeth out, though.  Ange, take another one.  He's got to go pick up some cocaine from those Pittsburgh guys.  Did he get that?  I got it.  A little Peck.  Nice, gentlemanly.  I hope this is the end of you.  I can't.  All of a sudden, you don't know.  Kenny's like, Jim never made it downstairs.  You'll find my fucking sneaker behind the curtain.  On top of Bobby's sandwich.  I'm going to Irvine, California to work.  I'm on Instagram.  A sneaker.  Not about you.  Jimmy, one more time.  Only if it's okay with Ange. 
[03:16:30]  Ange, one more time.  How are we doing the kissing?  Is he okay with it?  Okay.  He's a big fucking guy.  All right, good.  Is he a big guy?  Not only is he big, he's in shape.  He's not fucking around.  Come on.  You've got to hold the pose for a picture.  He's laughing very uncomfortable in there.  He don't care.  He's not jealous.  Why is he Bobby Senator?

He's got the littlest lips. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, she tried to feed him.  Tiny little lips.  The lips were...  She tried to feed the cock cocking like a fucking baby bird.  The contrast was hilarious on those lips.  Oh, my God.  She kissed his nose and his chin.  Almost sucked his face.  Yeah, he did, Edge.  That was close.  Big Edge almost took out his face.  That was a close one.  We got to go, really?

I've done shows for mob guys before.  The last thing you want is a six-foot-six guy named Moosey.

Be nice.  Be nice.  I did a mob, guys.  He came out of federal prison.  Oh, nice.  Joe the barber.  He goes...  The guy goes, meet me down at Ming's.  I go, Ming's has been closed for 10 years. 
[03:20:00]  He goes, it's open again.  Oh, shit.  It's all caddies and fucking Mercedes in the parking lot, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I go in, there's a table, they're playing cards with no shirts, just wife beaters.  There's lasagna and Chinese food on the table.  Great.  He's got his mother and his wife in the back cooking with Ming, the Chinese guy.  I'm doing a show.  I'm doing a show there.  I bring this kid, he's to just bomb in front of me.  He's Italian.  He's got fucking 10 minutes of the best Italian jokes. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, he's killing.  I've ever heard.  They carry him out.  But, you know, and Italian guys, when they like you, they'll kiss you more than fucking,  you know, gay guys.  I love this fucking...  They carry him out.  And then I got to go up.  And the fucking...  And the main guy, Joe the barber, turns the chair around in front of me, right in the front  row.  Oh, man.

Holy shit, I would have used him as a prop.  That's nice.  I did.  I did for 20 minutes.  I fucking made fun of this Chinese dude.  Chinese prop.  Every Asian joke in the world I did.  I think Chinese jokes could be very funny.  Yeah.  Of course they can.  Of course.  Of course.  Are we getting the wrap-up?  What?  We gotta get Big Ange out of here?  Wrap-up?  Yeah, yeah.  I just want to leave.

Get off my fucking back.  Hey. 
[03:25:30]  Let me put some headphones on so I can hear you.  Brian Possein.  I got a big audition today.  Brian Possein's coming by in a little bit.  All right, I'm going to leave when he comes.  Okay.  Who's Brian Possein?  You know Brian Possein.  He's a famous comedian.  He's been in a bunch of shit.  He's been in a ton of sitcoms, guest spots.  He's in Devil's Rejects.  Mr. Show.  What did you say, Eric?  He does a lot of stuff with Zach Galifianakis.  Comedian's a comedy tour.  Yeah, he was on Mr. Show.  He was on Sarah Silverman's show.  You know.  I don't.  Well, then you got to fucking step your comedy game up. 
[03:26:00]  Well, here's the deal, man.  Yeah, man.  I'm a face guy.  Talk to me.  I'm not a fucking name guy.  Talk to me, Bobby.  I'm a face guy.  Yeah.  I see a face.  I go, bing, bang.  I know to make the connections.  Right, I see.  That's old Hollywood.  Okay?  You're kind of an old Hollywood guy.  I'm not this new Hollywood where you got names and Twitters and Facebookses.  Yeah.  I know old Hollywood.  I know names, motherfuckers.  I know faces.  What kind of audition do you have going today?  Oh, dude.  It's for a big show.  It's a big show.  I know him.  He's great.  Yeah.  I love him.  It's for a TV show? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  No.  It's for a fucking play.  Vaudeville.  They do auditions for film as well.  So it could be television or film.  It's for a television show.  Yeah.  A hit show.  A new show.  How can it be a hit then?  Huh?  How can it be a hit show if it's a new show?  Because it's new.  They come out of the gate hot.  It's going to be a hit?  Like Presumed Innocent.  That shit's hot out of the gate.  You're much Sons of Anarchy.  You know, I got fucking mad at that show, man.  When?  I don't know.  I got kind of holier than thou when I watched the last episode.  Oh, this brand new one? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  When they burned the little girl.  Spoiler alert for anyone who hadn't seen it.  Look, here's my theory on your spoiler alert.  Two days ago.  A movie, I give you credit.  If it's a TV show and you haven't watched it, it's been two days, you're a fucking ass.  It's like a big show, though.  You're taking advantage of fucking, you're taking advantage of DVR.  Uh-huh.  If you have a day.  How long is the DVR?  Two days.  You've got two days.  Okay.  If you haven't watched it by today, you're taking advantage of it.  You're abusing it. 
[03:27:30]  What are you?  Stop that.  Sorry, I didn't know.  Just making fun of you.  But you thought it was definitely the darkest they've gone on Sons of Anarchy.  I got mad, dude.  I was like, there was no need for that.  There was no need for the extent that they showed that.  I didn't like it.  I got mad.  I stopped watching it.  You didn't watch the rest of the episode?  I didn't watch it.  As soon as that happened, I left.  What are you getting offended about?  I didn't get offended.  I don't know if it's offended.  I got appalled.  I was just like, what the fuck, man?  But don't they need to take it to the dark place? 
[03:28:00]  I mean, they kidnapped his baby before.  What else are they going to do?  Yeah, but they could have done that without doing what they did.  I guess you didn't need to see the little girl running back and forth while she was  flaming on fire.  Dude.  And who would have thought that little dude in the wheelchair from Oz was that vicious?  It's just...  I was like, he's from actually, more recently, from Lost.  I know.  I don't watch Lost, though.  Yeah, dude.  It really fucked me up.  I mean, I don't mean to say...  I don't know, you know...  Like, it was a brutal scene, but...  It wasn't brutal. 
[03:28:30]  They wouldn't even have put that scene in a movie.  No, it was really...  Name a movie that has a scene that brutal.  It would have to be, like, hostile.  Not even hostile has...  That's a horror movie.  I'm talking about a regular movie where they had something that fucking brutal and detailed.  Where they had that...  I mean, screaming, Daddy.  What the fuck?  They want...  Well, what happened on the show was this biker, you know, keep in mind, he ran down this...  Last season, he ran down this dude's daughter, not realizing he was his daughter or whatever. 
[03:29:00]  It was an accident.  He killed her, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  She went through a plate glass window and she died.  So, what he didn't realize was her father is this big gangster.  Like, he's the leader of all black gangs in whatever, California.  Yeah, he's Obama.  And so he...  So he kidnaps...  So he kidnaps this biker's daughter and he locks her up in this little thing underground  and then he sets her on fire while the biker is handcuffed to a pole.  It's the way he did it.  Now, they could have...  Okay, they could have poured the gasoline... 
[03:29:30]  Wait, we got some calls for you, Bob.  A couple people.  Are they mad because I fucking ruined it?  James?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, man.  What the fuck, Bobby?  You fucking ruined sons of Anarchy for me.  You didn't just jump right into it.  You know, when he burned that little girl.  Listen, dude.  First of all, look, I apologize, but don't abuse time.  John.  That's what you're doing.  You're abusing time.  John, welcome to After Open Anthony Live.  You know what, dude? 
[03:30:00]  I'm a truck driver.  I can't get home for a couple weeks, dude.  Oh, shit.  You fucked it up, Barney.  I always forget about truck drivers' lives.  Yeah, I forget about...  Dude, I'm sorry.  First of all, step your game up.  Get a TV in your truck with satellite with a little bunk bed in the back.  Yeah, what are you doing?  So you and your lot lizard can watch the show on time.  I mean, I get...  I have a little hookup named Rolandos, so I got to have the episode on DVD a couple weeks  ago, but I didn't come in here and be like...  Is that code for Roland?  Roland.  That's his name.  You didn't know that?  Rolando is his name? 
[03:30:30]  I...  Look at...  Man, seriously.  First of all, if you...  The DVR thing, if you're waiting two weeks to see the show, fuck you.  It's two days, not two weeks.  It literally premiered on September 11th, and it's now September 13th.  Care.  It hasn't even been 48 hours since the show was on.  It doesn't matter.  You should have watched it yesterday.  You literally gave people less than 36 hours to watch the show.  Yes.  You know what, dude?  Actually, wait.  36 hours from right now.  Literally at this moment.  People are putting their lives on pause.  36 hours.  Pause.  Back when I was a kid, you watched the show on Monday, or you didn't get to see it. 
[03:31:00]  Because DVR didn't exist.  For 10 years.  VCRs didn't exist.  For 10 years, you didn't get to see that show.  You understand?  Dan, if you missed a Brady Bunch episode, you didn't see it for 10 years.  I mean, listen, Bobby, you're old Hollywood, and a lot of people don't understand that.  I'm old Hollywood.  I recognize faces.  Great.  Greg in D.C.  Welcome to After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, you know what, dude?  I can name three movies off the top of my head that are more brutal than that. 
[03:31:30]  First, Man on Fire.  Boom!  What?  They put a bunch of tires around a guy.  They light him on fire.  He burns.  He rolls down a hill.  They shove a bomb up a guy's ass.  They light other people on fire.  Bomb up a guy's ass.  They're all dead.  Yeah, but they don't show you the guy being blown up.  They do.  They don't.  They do.  They don't.  What's the other movie?  You don't see the guy getting blown up.  The guy with the thing in his ass.  He turns around.  He walks away.  And then you never see the guy attached to the car being blown up. 
[03:32:00]  Ever.  If we're doing rational, Bobby, okay.  You're right.  Don't see the guy blow up.  People have figured out the depths of you.  How about Money Train?  Money Train.  Awful, awful movie, but they pour gasoline inside and light someone on fire.  You see the fire.  You see the fire, Bobby.  Money Train.  But here's the thing.  We're talking about a child screaming, Daddy, Daddy, help me.  A child screaming, Daddy, Daddy.  Let's go back in time to when Bobby was sucking dick. 
[03:32:30]  Aw, why'd you have to take it?  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  I love you.  We're going to go back to last week?  Go ahead.  Okay.  Any movie having to deal with Mexican cartels, especially lately, anything in Oz.  Oh, my God.  Oz, when you see people getting their legs broken and things like that.  There's some crazy shit on that show, Bobby.  Okay.  I think Oz, I mean, you might have a point with Oz.  I never really watched Oz, so I can't say that.  Great show.  This scene and this, Bobby, it's okay. 
[03:33:00]  Here's the thing, too, is that they're saying, these guys, I can buy that the bikey lifestyle.  Bikey?  That's what they are, bikers.  Bikey, though?  It's a biker lifestyle.  I say bikey.  Do you think they would ever go like, we're going to get on our bikies?  Sam, old Hollywood, that's what they used to call them, bikies.  They used to call them bikies back then?  They used to call them bikies.  All right.  Bikies, you don't know that.  I didn't know, because I'm not an old.  And then they changed it to biker.  I'm kind of this new, kind of young, flashy generation.  Back in the day, it was only a couple guys in the gang. 
[03:33:30]  It was bikies.  I see.  And there was bikes.  They started with bikes.  And then it was bikie.  Then it was biker.  Then it was biker.  Yeah, I kept going.  But here's the thing, is that, listen, this scene in this show was too much.  It was too much.  Because here's the thing, they're saying the cartels, okay, the bikie gangs, these guys  are killing people.  They're killing people.  And what are they, protect Charmin?  That's how we're supposed to say this is okay? 
[03:34:00]  Real biker gangs, drugs, guns, and kill people and rape people.  Right.  I don't think, I don't buy into that.  They're the angels of Charmin.  But here's the thing, is these guys, exactly, they protect Charmin so they can have your  cafe latte.  So you decided that in this one scene, you're giving up on the whole premise of the show?  I'm not giving up on the premise of the show, but I think they went, I, it was disturbing  to watch.  I had to walk out of the room.  All these people are with other movies.  You don't want, because the rape scene in Last House on the left, that was awful.  Beautiful scene.  You loved it.  I've masturbated to it many of times. 
[03:34:30]  I hope that's not true.  The original or the remake?  Which one do you prefer?  Original, man.  Yeah, because the remake wasn't as good.  You didn't like it as much?  No.  The rape scene itself or the movie?  The rape scene.  You didn't see the whole thing.  I only watched it up to the rape scene in both movies.  What else?  He did get some, you know, vengeance after the incident.  Look, man, it doesn't.  And it sets up the season.  It doesn't matter, dude.  That was a, that was a brutal scene that they could have stopped.  They could have cut. 
[03:35:00]  You know when they could have cut it?  When he lit the fire.  And you could have heard screams.  And that's it.  I guess he wanted to get your emotions going.  They got it.  They got it.  Because I really got mad.  I was like, and it has to do with probably a kid, a father.  I mean, it probably stirs.  I don't like when kids get hurt in shows.  But that's the thing.  You're supposed to get so angry because these are the most evil people ever.  Not on a fucking Sunday night in my house.  It's not Sunday.  It's Tuesday.  I don't want to fucking do that.  I could turn on the regular news if I want to get all fucked up and emotional. 
[03:35:30]  Let's not get political here, Bobby.  Well, listen, man, political Bob isn't coming on the show.  But what I'm saying is I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want it.  I don't need it.  I watch this shit to escape, not to fucking feel like shit.  Yeah, but it's not supposed to be so dark.  Just watch, you know, Yo Gabba Gabba.  And you'll feel all good.  I like Sons of Anarchy.  I just don't think they needed to go that far.  Brian Posehn.  Brian Posehn.  What's up, man?  What's up?  I got to fly.  I'll see you guys later.  You're Levity Live tonight.  Levity Live tonight.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  It's in the Palisades Mall in West Niagara. 
[03:36:00]  Awesome.  I've been there a bunch of times.  Why don't you come?  I should come.  It's my, it's right by Westchester.  Please.  Bye, buddy.  Thanks, Bobby.  Take it easy, man.  What's up, buddy?  How are you?  Nice to meet you.  How's it going, man?  Sit down.  Right here?  Yeah, sure.  We're live on the air.  We're transitioning as we go.  Awesome.  You just got off a plane, huh?  Yeah, about four hours ago, yeah.  Then you had to sit in the lobby.  I was reading your Twitter.  Oh, yes.  You had to sit in the lobby of the hotel?  Uh-huh.  You didn't get early check-in or anything like that? 
[03:36:30]  No, I'm an idiot.  I did it so last minute, and then I was a crybaby about it on Twitter.  You're just like, I'll complain about it.  It's my own fault.  Yeah.  But I'll complain about it.  Well, you're doing Caroline's this weekend.  Yes.  How often are you in New York?  It's been a while.  I haven't been at Caroline's in several years.  Yeah.  I was doing comics until...  Is that still around?  I don't think so.  I think that is in the dirt.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you're there.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:37:00]  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Two shows.  Friday, two shows, Saturday, and then Sunday.  So it's carolines.com.  Everybody knows where Caroline's is.  It's here in Manhattan.  But I love your career because it seems like you've just gotten to do...  At some point, you decided you're just going to do everything that you like.  You know what I mean?  Because you're a guy who likes metal, and you like comic books and stuff like that.  And that's kind of what you do now.  It's crazy.  But it was never like I decided to do that.  I sort of lucked into everything.  And it's just through hanging out, really. 
[03:37:30]  Like being around metal guys, and then they were like,  Hey, we should write some stupid songs.  You know, that kind of thing.  And then hanging out with comic book guys.  And, you know, I recently got a gig at Marvel, basically through...  You have an actual gig at Marvel?  Yeah, I'm doing a full year of Deadpool.  Wow.  Which comes out in November.  And, yeah, that's totally insane to me.  Like being like a comic book geek my whole life,  and then just sort of hanging out with them at Comic Con every year in San Diego.  And then eventually them going, 
[03:38:00]  You should take over the book.  And I was like, all right.  You're a recognizable guy.  How is it?  Because I always see you like...  Because we've been...  I went to Comic Con with Norton for the last couple years.  And we always kind of see you in passing.  And I go, oh, we should...  And then, you know, we don't end up crossing paths.  But do you get recognized, like, constantly the whole time you're there?  Yeah, at that place.  Especially because that's your crowd, kind of.  Yeah, I'm sort of the mayor there.  One of the mayors.  Yeah.  What do you like at Comic Con?  What do I like?  Like, I don't buy too many books anymore, but that used to be the thing. 
[03:38:30]  And now, since you've been there, I mean, it's mostly about movies and other stuff now.  But for me, it's like the hang.  Yeah.  You know, it's a chance once a year to see a bunch of dudes that I never get to see and just hang out and talk about stupid stuff.  So how do you approach now, like, as a comic book fan, as a ridiculous comic book fan who it's like, this is kind of your dream gig.  How do you go forward writing a comic book?  Do you write just what you want?  Do you think about the audience?  Do you?  Both. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, I mean, that's the thing.  I'm writing with my writing partner that I've written some other comic books with.  And we always look at everything as, you know, what would we want to read, really?  You know, like, what would we do with these guys with this character, Deadpool, that would make us laugh and make us pick up the book if we hadn't been reading it for a while?  Sure.  That's the main thing, is we want to bring new people to the book, people that used to read it and haven't picked it up in years.  And then people that, like, might just see my name on it, you know, and then want them to stick around. 
[03:39:30]  That's, like, the real idea.  And do all these, like, do all these connections end up coming through comedy?  Or are they people who have seen you in odd spots?  Like, people who saw you in Mr. Show, like, years ago?  And they're like, oh!  It's both, but, I mean, with metal, it's sort of everything.  It's, like, you know, the stand-up and then also a lot of Mr. Show fans.  Like, that one being a thing I learned really early on is a lot of those guys were watching Mr. Show, you know, DVDs on the bus and stuff.  Like, that's how I got in with Anthrax. 
[03:40:00]  It's crazy when you find out that those guys are watching your stuff.  Yeah, and then I've met, like, death metal bands, like, really scary bands, you know, like, it's like, do you guys have a sense of humor?  Yeah, we just love having a lab and hanging out on the bus.  Yeah, they were murdering goats and standing in front of a pentagram all day.  Sacrifices.  Yeah, yeah.  Just watching your DVDs.  Right.  Makes you question yourself.  Yeah, I always get jealous because I'm, like, a giant wrestling geek.  Uh-huh.  And I always get jealous when wrestlers come in here and Norton's here and they don't know who I am, but they're like, 
[03:40:30]  Jim, I love your comedy.  And I'm like, oh, fuck, I've got to do something.  Is he even a wrestling fan?  No, he doesn't care.  He doesn't at all.  He doesn't care at all.  But these guys, and that probably makes it easier for them to be like, yeah, I'm a big fan of your work.  Right.  Do you have to curtail?  Without having him nerd out on them.  Right.  Do you ever have to curtail your fanboyness around, like, when you meet guys that you love?  Sometimes, yeah, because with the metal guys, you don't want to go, oh, my God, I love you so much.  They're like, what? 
[03:41:00]  So what was it like?  Freaking weirdo.  Yeah, you have to kind of try to be like, okay, human interactions.  Don't just ask him about himself the whole time and, like, obscure album questions and stuff like that.  What was the first person that you got to meet in that?  When did it kind of start happening where people were coming up to you and being like, oh, yeah, I like your stuff.  We should do something.  God, it's been a while now.  Yeah.  Like, right after Mr. Show was kind of when it really started.  So, God, more than 10 years.  And that was, the way I met Anthrax was, for me, just being at a show by myself because all my comedy friends don't listen to metal. 
[03:41:30]  They're all pussies and they all listen to, you know, like, Elvis Costello and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, it's like metal, like, it's not the cool thing right now, is it?  No, and it hasn't been for a long time.  Yeah, 20 years or something.  It's just you and Jim Florentine last time listening to metal.  And my friend's going, you guys still listen to that stuff? 
[03:42:00]  Like, yeah, it's fucking badass.  I liked it when I was 15.  Yeah, I did too, and I still do.  You don't give up?  Is that what it is?  Yeah, I mean, I have a couple.  The metalheads I came up with in high school, one of them stuck with it, and the other guy, like, got into pop music, and he's a weirdo.  And me and the other metalhead are like, what happened to him?  And then he thinks we're, you know, idiots for sticking up, liking this stuff for 30-something years.  Because that's the same thing I do.  Like, that's why I'm still a wrestling geek and still doing all this nonsense. 
[03:42:30]  I'm still buying action figures and stuff like that.  Yeah, man.  Because you latch onto these hobbies as a kid, and you just refuse to give up on them.  Yeah, that's the way I am with comic books, horror movies, and all this other stuff that I've also fallen into.  Yeah.  Well, you were in The Devil's Rejects.  Yeah.  I'm a huge Rob Zombie fan.  Like, I have a tattoo on my shoulder, Rob Zombie's logo, and I showed it to him when he was in here before, and he was just like, okay, that's...  Yeah, see, that's the thing we were talking about.  Yeah.  Like, look, I put your face...  And then I actually signed it at a signing, and I tattooed that on him. 
[03:43:00]  He was like, wow, this was professional a minute ago.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  How was that?  A lot of metalheads are, like, kind of introverts, too, you know?  Like, guys that got into metal, and a lot of those band guys you meet, like, you meet guitar players, and they've spent 30 years just sitting in a room trying to get better and better.  Right.  And then when you try to talk to them, you know, and you have, like, high energy.  I barely have any energy, but, like, when I geek out on somebody, they're like, oh, I want to go back to my room. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, I'm not really...  That's why I'm not a front man.  I just kind of hang in the back and do this.  Yeah.  You're a god at that!  Yeah.  But you're amazing!  What was it like being in Devil's Rejects and getting shot in the head?  That was a crazy thing, too.  That was a...  It was Chris Hardwick, a buddy of mine, comic.  He died in House of a Thousand Corpses, and when he did, I was like, you lucky bastard. 
[03:44:00]  And I gave him shit a couple of times when I see him, you know?  It's like, I can't believe you get to die in a horror film.  And he's like, Rob would love you.  You know, you should meet Rob.  And, you know, he's like, Rob actually watches a lot of sitcoms, so I went to a party.  And you're like the guy, but anybody who doesn't know who Brian Posehn is, you just Google image him,  because he's the quintessential, oh, I know that guy from somewhere, guy.  Because you did every sitcom when they were, like, in the big sitcom boom. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then, so I went over to the house with Hardwick, and right away, Rob's like,  oh, yeah, me and my wife watch you.  You know, you were funny on Everybody Loves Raymond, the news radio, and he, like, knows all those sitcoms.  Rob Zombie and his wife just sitting chuckling at Everybody Loves Raymond.  Yeah, it was kind of weird.  But then we became friends, and, you know, when the second movie came up, Devil's Rejects,  he had written another part for me, you know, and he told me,  I want you to play a serial killer that wears a baby into the van. 
[03:45:00]  You know when they go to get ice cream?  Yeah.  The movie really well, when she goes to get Tootie, fucking Fruity.  For sure.  There was a scene that he had written where I was a serial killer working on my own,  and I tried to kill her.  Rob loves serial killers.  Yeah.  There's not enough serial killers in my movie.  Right, and then the other badass serial killers come and save her and then kill me.  And I was like, oh, that'll be awesome.  Right.  I get to die in a horror movie, and I get to be a serial killer in a horror movie.  And then that, like, didn't work. 
[03:45:30]  You know, it was like, it was kind of a weird scene, or a weird couple of scenes.  So he took that out.  It's a huge coincidence for that to happen.  Really suspending disbelief.  How about if a serial killer happens to get ice cream,  and another serial killer is running the ice cream truck?  Right.  But it would have worked.  But, yeah, that got cut.  And then he goes, how about if I just, you know, have you play a roadie,  and you get shot in the face, so I was like, dude, I'll do whatever.  Sounds fantastic.  Yeah.  But that scene that you're in, we were just in here,  Bob Kelly was just in here a minute ago. 
[03:46:00]  You watched Sons of Anarchy?  Yeah.  Did you watch the premiere?  Uh-huh.  Bob Kelly already spoiled the scene where the girl gets burned.  Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.  Where the girl gets burned alive.  We were talking about brutal scenes like that.  He said he had to turn off the show after that.  I didn't.  I thought it worked.  But.  Yeah, it didn't bother me.  I mean, I've seen everything in horror films.  It just didn't affect you whatsoever.  You're like, oh, girl's on fire.  I was jacking off to it.  Is that weird?  No, no.  Of course.  This is where my mind's gone.  It's like, finally, something I can work it to. 
[03:46:30]  It's a long time.  They brought television back.  I watch girl on fire porn, and by that I mean just girls on fire.  But that was a brutal scene, too.  It was brutal.  The one that you were in.  Oh, yeah.  Like when he starts shoving his gun down this chick's underpants.  Yeah.  And it's Priscilla Barnes.  Underpants.  That's a real sexy way to say it, too.  Yeah.  Girls love it when you call it that.  Yeah.  Take off your underpants.  But it is Priscilla Barnes from Three's Company.  Yeah.  So I grew up watching her. 
[03:47:00]  And it's surreal.  And then I have to play dead for two days.  Oh, yeah.  Because I did five days on the movie.  So my role in Devil's Rejects is two days of setup, one day where I get killed, and then  two days where I play dead.  And you're just laying there.  Yeah.  So I got paid for two days just laying there and trying not to breathe.  It was great.  Because that was the thing.  Like, he'd go by me, and he'd come over to me and go, all right, man, the camera's  going to be right on you, so you can't breathe for like a minute. 
[03:47:30]  And I'm like, okay, I'll try.  You're like, well, I'm getting paid.  I guess I should do something.  Right.  And then these people are, you know, acting out this horrible scene.  That's what I was thinking about of watching Sons of Anarchy.  That's why I guess it didn't affect me as much.  Yeah.  Is because I was thinking of the girl who's played that she's on fire.  Uh-huh.  When they're off her, and they're on, what's the guy's name?  The guy playing her dad. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, his father.  Trigger.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When they're on the father.  She's like probably sitting, you know, with a, you know, wearing a robe.  Yeah.  And like sitting on a director's chair and just going, oh, like off camera.  And her father's going, no, no.  And then he's got to emote.  He's got to pretend that she's on fire.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Because, yeah, it's not like she's going to be the one.  So I just, that's why it didn't affect me.  Like, I was immediately out on it.  So you're totally displaced from everything.  It's amazing that you could still be a fan of all this stuff. 
[03:48:30]  And like, because usually when somebody's let all the way behind the curtain, they kind  of give it up.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  No, I still love, I still love TV and movies.  Yeah.  You know, I have a brick and bad.  I watched every episode of this year.  Sons of Anarchy.  I've been waiting for.  Yeah.  So, so, but.  I still get into it.  But then, yeah, there are moments like that where I'm like, oh, that's how they did that.  You know.  So you had to lie down on the floor while Bill Moseley was shoving a gun into Priscilla  Barnes' panties.  Yes.  And just kind of. 
[03:49:00]  Her underpants.  Her underpants.  There's a gun in your underpants.  And just sit there trying not to react.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  For two days.  How long have you been doing comedy for?  Oh, um.  God, 26 years now.  And how long was it before things started rolling?  Like, because I guess, was it, for you, was Mr. Show, like, when things really.  Well, no, a little bit before that, um, I started getting, you know, back in the early 90s, there 
[03:49:30]  was stand-up everywhere, if you remember.  Like, there was, you know, Comedy Central had a million stand-up shows.  Um, other, you know, other networks back then had, you know, there was two drink minimum.  Like, my first time to New York was coming to shoot a show.  And how long had you been?  And I did a lot of those.  And I did, uh, I did Star Search in the early 90s.  So back then, it was like.  So I did all that stuff before Mr. Show.  You could get on TV if you were a comedian.  Yeah.  Yeah, there was a lot of different opportunities for it.  But, and, none of us were headliners. 
[03:50:00]  You know, I was, uh, you know, um, an opener and a middle back then.  Right.  But I was, I had a bunch of TV spots, like, immediately, because I kind of had, well, obviously,  I have a look.  Yeah, yeah.  But then I also had, like, this weird angle, you know, I was sort of, sort of dressed grunge  and, you know, but it was nerdy, too.  Right.  You know.  And that's the other thing.  You have not given up.  Like, that was not, Judah Friedlander was in here a few weeks ago and he was saying the  same thing.  He was like, yeah, I'm kind of sick of, like, hipsters thinking that I'm being a hipster. 
[03:50:30]  Right.  He's like, no, like, this is how I started and I got made fun of for a long time for it.  Yeah, man.  And it's kind of starting to be a little bit cool.  Well, I always hated, like, when alternative comedy, when we got labeled as that, because  I was doing that in front of brick walls.  You were just going to straight clubs.  And doing what I wanted to do.  Yeah.  I just didn't give a fuck.  I mean, well, I did.  I always wanted to get laughs, but there was also always this part of, I only want people  like me to like me. 
[03:51:00]  You know what I mean?  How did you do that early on, though?  It was hard.  Yeah, because that's a lot of integrity to maintain.  No.  Well, and it wasn't, you know, it was just stubbornness, really.  It was like, this shit is funny.  So I'd be in Placerville or, you know, places all around California when I first started going  up and fucking eating it and going to Oakland and eating it and going to all these other  places, but then going to San Francisco and killing.  So you're sitting there going, you know, I don't want to say smart people, but, you know, 
[03:51:30]  weirdos or whatever.  Right.  And then kind of finding my crowd.  Right.  So you're saying this shit is funny and I refuse to learn anything new for them.  So.  Right.  And then it took L.A.  and it took like the alternative rooms before I finally went, oh, wow, I have a bigger audience  than I ever thought, you know.  Yeah.  And then Comedians of Comedy really helped with that.  But, you know, it also helped like kind of going, taking other jobs and then kind of  establishing myself as a sitcom guy before I could come back into standup and then kind  of have, you know, oh, it's that guy. 
[03:52:00]  You know what I mean?  Right.  So, yeah.  So during that time you did what?  You did, you did Friends.  You did Everybody Loves Raymond.  Yeah.  News, radio.  You did an episode of Seinfeld, right?  Uh-huh.  And then I did Just Shoot Me for four years.  Right.  Of course.  And that was when you had, because the other ones you were just doing like little parts here  in there, can you make a living doing that, like just jumping on as many sitcoms as you  can?  At that point, yeah.  Yeah.  But then 10 years later, not so much.  It doesn't work anymore.  No, no.  You have to do a reality show there.  But then you still get, you know, you get those residual checks forever. 
[03:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  But they get smaller and smaller and smaller.  Just get a check for life.  Those are hilarious.  Like every once in a while I'll call my mom and go, 22 cents today.  From Seinfeld.  Yeah, from Seinfeld.  Thanks, Jerry.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think he's cashing 22 cents.  No, no.  He's probably doing all right still with it.  The checks haven't gotten that minuscule for him yet.  So, but you still enjoy doing comedy?  Is that kind of your...  Yeah, but, oh, now I do.  But I went through a point when I was writing and doing other stuff where it just wasn't 
[03:53:00]  that fun anymore.  And doing The Road was kind of a drag when you weren't a headliner.  And then, luckily I was able to, like after Comedians of Comedy, or kind of right around  that time, I started going out on my own and headlining.  And then it was way more fun.  And I guess...  Because I was actually drawing an audience.  And before, yeah, and before you do Comedians of Comedy, you don't know what the audience  is.  So you haven't found your crowd yet.  Right.  So you're sitting there, like you said, half the night you're eating it and half the night  you're killing.  Well, I still, I mean, to this day I still get some nights where my, I've got my contingent 
[03:53:30]  of black t-shirt guys, you know, guys that look like me with pot tits and facial hair.  Which is not the typical L.A. crowd, I wouldn't think.  No, but around the country.  Yeah, yeah.  And then there's the 60-year-old woman with her arms crossed going, is he going to talk  about his dick for 45 minutes?  And the guy with the black t-shirt?  When I'm 10 minutes in and that's all I've talked about.  The guy with the black t-shirt's like, yeah, he is!  Yes, he is. 
[03:54:00]  What's it like in New York?  What's the, are the crowds...  It's been a little while, you know?  It depends on the club, so you know how clubs are here, where some of them are touristy  or some of them are bridge and tunnel-y and, you know, so I'm looking forward to seeing  what happens this weekend.  Yeah, it'll be interesting to see.  I mean, I tweeted out...  I hope I get enough fans in there and, you know...  I think there are, too, because I just tweeted out randomly last night that you were going  to be on the show today, and I just got a ton of people going, yes, yes!  Like, you've created, I guess, and they're all from different little projects that you've  done. 
[03:54:30]  Right.  Do you look for those little kind of cult-y projects to do where you're going to build  up a loyal audience?  No, man, it's just like...  Or you just do what you like?  Yeah, it's just like everything I've done.  It's just sort of...  Most of my jobs have been offered to me through friends.  I mean, I've auditioned over the years and gotten some things, but, you know, stuff like  Tom Goes to the Mayor is just through those guys saying, hey, we want you to play Gibbons.  It's this little weird dude, and do this voice, and, you know, and a lot of other stuff. 
[03:55:00]  Even Just Shoot Me came from a writer in the room going, hey, this nerd character we're  writing, I know a guy who would be perfect for that, you know?  And then I didn't even have to audition for that, so, like...  Did you do a lot of auditioning?  I do, yeah, and I still do.  I just...  I just...  I'm in Guys with Kids in a couple of weeks, and...  Oh, okay.  That I actually had to go in, and...  That's weird, because you have, like you said, you have obviously a look.  Yeah. 
[03:55:30]  It's a distinct thing.  Right.  And so you'd think there'd be enough of that sort of, like, that's the guy we need.  Yeah, I mean, there is that, but sometimes they want you to jump through hoops, and especially  maybe they want you to do something different.  It's like, oh, I've seen that guy do the thing where he does this, and then...  So, let's get him to do something else, you know?  Are you a horror...  That's all I did on Just Shoot Me, was walk in like this and scream.  What's it like being on a sitcom like that?  Like, what's it like doing that character and knowing you're going to do the same thing 
[03:56:00]  every day and doing it for four years?  That was a lot of fun.  It stays fun?  Yeah, it totally was.  I could have still been doing...  Well, maybe now, not now.  Maybe now...  I've been doing it for 30 years.  Yeah, maybe now I'd be a little burned on it.  But I still had fun.  I mean, Spade was fun to hang around with.  He's just an idiot, and he's fun to, you know, just laugh at crap all day long.  And then those...  They wrote crazy stories for me all the time.  Right.  Like, I had, you know, a tarantula one week, and then I have, you know, a vulture. 
[03:56:30]  I had to hold a vulture in my hands while a vulture's flapping his arms.  Like, it was fucking horrifying.  That's what you look for.  Yeah, but no.  No, but just they kept me doing crazy things.  And that's all that, you know, once I was on that show, I was like, oh, I'm that guy  now.  I'm the guy that comes in and just something ridiculous happens.  Which is good.  I mean, and then people remember you.  Well, you'd rather be that dude.  I remember being really young and hearing what a character actor was and going, that 
[03:57:00]  sounds way more appealing than being a regular actor.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, man.  Like, you were never like, what?  He doesn't get to go to the Oscars?  No, but I never went, that's what I'm going to do.  But I remember being around 10 or 11 and hearing what a character actor was and going, oh,  those guys have the cool part.  Yeah.  I always felt like guys on sitcoms that would walk in and just say dumb shit, you know, like  playing our coach and, you know, like the big guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The big guy on coach.  It was like, that guy is the sweet part. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  Because he doesn't, he's not in every scene and he doesn't have to carry the bullshit  story.  Right.  He doesn't, like on Everybody Loves Raymond.  Raymond has to be mad and then work things out.  But the brother gets to walk in.  Right, yeah.  Just gets to come in and lighten everything up.  Yeah, yeah.  Those are the parts.  Like the big doofy, what's his name in Night Court?  Yeah, exactly.  Bull.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bull very rarely carried a story.  He didn't have that kind of pressure put on him.  No, no, no. 
[03:58:00]  And thank God for that too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So are you like a horror movie snob now?  Do you still enjoy them or do you have an era that you're like, this is where we peaked?  I'm both.  I mean, I still check out new movies, but then I, you know, I don't think anybody's  ever going to be, yeah, I had to make sure I was wearing John Carpenter.  But yeah, I mean, I don't think anybody's ever going to beat Halloween or The Thing.  Right.  You know.  And what do you think of the remakes? 
[03:58:30]  Like I said.  Yeah, yeah, you don't think that.  I liked Halloween.  I liked what Rob did of kind of setting up Michael Myers and making him more like a serial  killer, but it's not what he was in the original movie.  Right.  It's sort of a separate thing.  I enjoy it separately.  The Thing remake, I didn't love so much because it seemed like way too much CGI and, you know.  I think a lot of people didn't like The Thing remake too much.  Yeah, yeah, it wasn't a big one. 
[03:59:00]  You're a married guy, right?  Yes.  How did you, before you, how long have you been married for?  Eight years.  Oh, okay.  So did you ever, did you, do you have now like, you know, groupies or like nerd girls  coming up to you and like, are you kind of the weirdo fantasy guy?  Occasionally.  Yeah, I do.  There are girls that would love to go home with me occasionally.  I get that every once in a while.  Yeah.  And it's a type.  Yeah, I mean, I, but there are girls that weren't around, like when I was single because 
[03:59:30]  my wife and I have been married for eight years, but we've been together 15 and there's  like a type now.  So she's been there kind of forever almost.  Yeah, there's a type that didn't really exist, you know, like the suicide girl.  Right.  That wasn't a thing 15, 20 years ago, you know, so now I get these girls covered in  tattoos and with like black glasses and shit and dyed black hair and it's like, oh, you're  so hot, but where were you fucking in the 90s?  Just yelling in their faces, what, where were you?  Yeah, yeah. 
[04:00:00]  It would have been so easy.  Yeah.  Is it so, but now you have to be like, well, I'm married, I have a kid.  Well, they know it now.  You know, I, I talk so much about it on stage.  I even do a thing right now where if I were to cheat, you know, but it's really clear that  I'm not gonna, you know.  Is that for your style?  Is that to make it so that it's very, it's a lot easier for you not to cheat?  No.  Like you set this up.  So don't, just leave me alone.  No, it came from an organic place.  It came from my wife being afraid of me cheating and I just think that's ridiculous because the 
[04:00:30]  whole bit is about how gross I am and, and, you know, how, um, taking off my shirt, you  know, the girl would be like, you know, and I'd be like, it gets worse and then I'd take  off my pants, you know, it's like, cause it's just like, uh, with my wife, the degradation  has been gradual.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like she's been with me for 15 years.  She's learned to accept certain things.  Not that I was a piece of ass 15 years ago.  She had the young Brian Posey.  Right.  But, but now it's like, I, I, uh, you know, I say in the act, it's, it's like showing a, 
[04:01:00]  uh, your shitty car or having somebody get in your shitty car for the first time or there's  too many explanations and apologies.  You're like, oh, that hasn't worked in years.  Yeah.  You got to throw your shoulder into that.  They didn't grow with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, uh, that's funny.  You're going to be at Caroline's, uh, this weekend it's Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Uh, carolines.com.  It's on 49th and 50th.  Uh, it's right there on Broadway. 
[04:01:30]  Do you, uh, the tourists, do they still, I would assume that even with tourists, they  would recognize you from the shows.  No, I do well.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah.  Don't get me wrong.  I mean, I do well in front of anybody, but I have more fun when it's, when there's more  of my people in there and I'll loosen up, you know, and, and, uh, it's just, you can say  things that you don't have to worry about, you know?  I mean, it's not just references, but regular people, you know, like even in San Francisco 
[04:02:00]  or a place like that, where you think that they, they've heard everything.  There's certain topics where you just even start to go on a topic, you know?  Yeah.  And they're like, Oh no.  What about, you know, you just get groaners on the end.  But when they're your crowd, no one groans.  Of course.  Yeah.  The one thing I do get though, when it's all my crowd is, um, I'll get some of these  girls that I'm talking about, like the suicide girls that defend me when I'm making fun of 
[04:02:30]  myself.  Like I'll be doing self-deprecating bits.  It's like, I'm a disgusting fucking pig.  And they'll go, no, it's like, shut up.  That's all this is about.  You're worse than a heckler.  I'm doing 20 minutes now.  I'm just about to talk about how much I hate myself.  And the last thing you need is the guys being like, what?  That chick loves him.  What's he talking about?  This isn't funny at all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, what about when there's somebody that you love watching you?  Like, you know, you're an obsessive guy kind of like me and you have these people that  you have this massive fandom for who obviously come to you and be like, oh, I like what you 
[04:03:00]  do.  Can you, do you, does it change your vibe when you're doing a show and somebody like that,  like Scott Ian or somebody, you know, when you first met him before you became closer  with him?  Is this sitting in the audience?  No, it's weird.  You just try not to think about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause like anytime anybody who's got any sort of fame at all goes, oh yeah, I'm  I was listening to your show the other day.  I go, what?  And like the next day, it's just completely in my head.  Like this sucks.  This sucks.  I can't believe he's listening to it right now. 
[04:03:30]  No, I haven't let that bother me.  I've had, you know, over the years, a lot of band guys, like when I'm in Tampa, that's  where all the death metal bands are.  So that's been a little weird to like go, you know, cannibal corpses here.  Like I've even said that on stage, like you guys, you may not care, but this is fucking  awesome.  Cannibal corpses here.  And they're just laughing.  Three of them.  And being jolly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Their name's cannibal corpse.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Well, listen, we got to go.  We got to make room for Ron and Fez. 
[04:04:00]  Definitely check out Brian Posehn.  What's your Twitter?  The Brian Posehn?  Yes.  And it's P-O-S-E-H-N.  I like also that not only did you never change your material, but you didn't develop one of  those show business names.  Like you have a very hard to pronounce name on first site.  You like that.  Yeah.  I've gotten used to it.  Well, check them out at Caroline's all weekend.  Caroline's dot com for tickets.  Thank you for joining us.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  And we'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
