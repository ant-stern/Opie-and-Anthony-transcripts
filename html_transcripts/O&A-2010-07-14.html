<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a profane retraction of a previous apology, followed by jokes about potential FCC repercussions.  The conversation then shifted to the MLB All-Star game, with Opie criticizing the home-field advantage rule.  The hosts' discussion of George Steinbrenner's recent death initially involved irreverent and profane comments, transitioning into a critique of celebrity tweets about him. This led to a highly offensive and controversial discussion about race relations in America, sparked by Rush Limbaugh's comments and a caller's remarks on the Black Panthers.  Their opinions on the Black Panthers, NAACP, and the Obama administration were expressed using highly offensive language.

The show then tackled the challenges of podcast scheduling.  Intern Love Buzz, wearing a Yankees jersey, was mocked for his limited knowledge of Yankees history, leading to a discussion of Billy Martin, Reggie Jackson, and Mickey Rivers, punctuated by more profanity and offensive racial comments. Love Buzz was tasked with researching Mickey Rivers.  The conversation then veered towards Lindsay Lohan's impending jail sentence and speculation about potential abuse she might face, using graphic and sexually explicit language, culminating in a discussion of the prison exploitation film "Caged Heat." The segment concluded with irreverent commentary on the news and a Mel Gibson audio remix.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on leaked audio tapes of Mel Gibson's angry phone conversations with Oksana Grigorieva. The hosts played multiple clips, highlighting Gibson's extremely offensive and racist language and verbally abusive behavior.  They discussed Gibson's accusations of Grigorieva being a "gold digger" and criticized her music career, playing a clip and mocking her singing. Listener calls followed, with some relating their own experiences with similar arguments and one criticizing Gibson's continued relevance. The segment also mentioned a sexually explicit video clip and discussed Q104's Lady Gaga ticket promotion, mocking the "criminal" involved and comparing it to similar promotions at other stations.  The hosts used highly offensive and vulgar language throughout.

The "Q Criminal" radio promotion was dissected extensively, mocking the "criminal's" poor acting and repetitive clues, playing clips from various radio personalities involved, notably the inept "Bobo."  The hosts ridiculed the apparent corporate involvement, speculating it was a pre-packaged promotion.  A listener call about Matt Pinfield's supposed jail time due to a contest-related issue led to a tangent on an FCC ruling regarding fleeting expletives, further tangents about Lindsay Lohan and lesbian gangs in prison, and a discussion of a party attended by the hosts involving nudity and excessive drinking.  A phone call from Patrice O'Neal and communication issues were also mentioned, all while using highly offensive language.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of parenting, including potty training and the early introduction of children to driving. Kenny recounted a near-accident. This segued into more audio remixes, including a Mel Gibson/ *The Shining* mashup and the "Double Rainbow" video, sparking numerous crude and offensive jokes.  Comedian Mike DiStefano, a *Last Comic Standing* contestant, joined in studio.  He discussed his experience on the show, his comedic style, opinions on the judges (Giraldo and Kindler), and the state of stand-up comedy.  DiStefano's upcoming Comedy Central special and a joint DVD project with Opie and Anthony were mentioned.  The conversation returned to the Mel Gibson audio, focusing on its comedic aspects and Gibson's emotional instability.  The hosts and guest used extensive profanity and engaged in sexually explicit and offensive humor throughout the interview.

Finally, another segment focused on the Mel Gibson tapes, describing the explicit sexual content and Gibson's anger. The hosts repeatedly called the audio "fantastically fucking funny," comparing it to other leaked recordings (Pat O'Brien). DiStefano performed a short stand-up routine. The hosts discussed merchandise based on phrases from the tapes ("Smile and blow me") and mentioned DiStefano's Twitter account and upcoming shows.  The hosts used extremely offensive language, including racial slurs and homophobic epithets, throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strange to understand.  Opie and Anthony on Satellite Radio.  Hosts Anthony Kamiya and Greg Opie here.  The controversial team.  Opie and Anthony are apologizing for yet another apology.  Comment profanity like a rat.  Is this the last straw for the Rocky Radio Bureau?  Yee-haw! Yeah! Come on, bring it on.  You know what? I think this is hilarious.  A whole big bunch of fun.  The greatest show on Satellite Radio today.  This show is like the box of chocolates that Forrest's mother was talking about. 
[00:00:30]  You're a no-good son of a bitch, Bob.  You motherfuckers.  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine. Whatever.  What's going on?  I do what I'm told.  Completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on. It's shocking.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Wow, did you see that All-Star game last night? 
[00:01:00]  No.  Woo!  Why bother?  It's like, why bother?  You know what the results are going to be when you wake up in the morning.  They'll tell you.  It's the old National League one this year.  All right.  They won.  Did I have to watch it?  Well, baseball came up with the dumbest thing ever in sports.  And I challenge you to come up with something dumber.  Whatever league wins the All-Star game gets home field advantage for the World Series.  That is the stupidest thing ever invented in sports. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Because you've got a bunch of guys that already know they don't have a shot at the World Series this year.  Dang it, Megan.  So you expect them to play really hard so the National League gets home field advantage?  It's dumb.  If you want a really good All-Star game, you come up with a sponsor, you come up with a lot of money,  and the winning team gets a shitload of cash.  Give them a million dollars apiece or something.  Then you'll see a great game.  There's incentive. 
[00:02:00]  But the incentive to get home field advantage for the World Series is so stupid.  There's only a couple of players that would care.  Maybe Travis could help me out.  I mean, how many players on the National League team have a shot at the World Series, would you guess?  Way less than half, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Geez.  Probably maybe a dozen.  So all the guys on those shitty teams, why would they play hard?  Why?  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, it's just garbage.  But, wow.  George dead.  And look at that.  George Steinbrenner.  National League wins.  He wouldn't be happy.  Well, that's why he died.  I saw that on Twitter last night.  See, he'd rather die than see the National League win the All-Star Game. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, I'm sure.  A-boo!  You know what?  I'm a New Yorker, Yankee fan.  Grew up knowing all about, not all about, but enough.  He was in the news all the time.  Back page of the papers.  George Steinbrenner.  I've fucking had it with George dead Steinbrenner.  I care fucking less enough.  He hasn't even been dead a full day.  And believe me.  He died yesterday morning. 
[00:03:30]  Give him 24 hours.  Fuck that.  I go to turn on Seinfeld last night.  Somber music.  Channel 5 News is doing a somber.  We remember George Steinbrenner.  Let's look back.  The guy was known as a scumbag.  No one liked him.  The sports writers are all coming out like, oh, there was a different side of George that no one really saw.  Yeah, you didn't either.  He yelled at you.  He yelled at everyone.  He was a prick. 
[00:04:00]  He was a fucking prick.  And now they're treating him like he's fucking Mother Teresa.  He brought a lot of championships to New York.  He did.  And you know what?  So his managing style worked.  Bravo.  So his managing style worked.  Bravo for him.  Do you hear Torrey?  Torrey was like, yeah, he wasn't always the easiest guy to work for.  And that's after he's dead.  You know what that means?  He fucking sucked to work for.  I just like to go through the post and read the celebrity Twitters and stuff like Yogi  Barra and some cool ones.  Oh, can we see that? 
[00:04:30]  No, no, no.  It's in the page four of the post.  Poor Yogi.  How old is he?  Yogi.  He's just.  Yoga.  Yogi.  Yogi Bear.  What?  You got tired, Jimmy.  Oh, here's the celebrity tweets.  Which one's your?  Jimmy's in here.  Oh, I didn't even notice.  What the fuck?  I didn't even notice.  Where's Jimmy?  That's the first one I see.  Jimmy writes, George Steinbrenner has passed away.  The Grim Reaper was seen leaving his hospital room wearing a Red Sox hat. 
[00:05:00]  That was definitely meant as a goof, too, not to be dramatic.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Thank you for explaining that.  They were all being.  I was goofing.  All of them were a goof.  Yeah, goof tweets and then the dumb paper picks it up as real.  Yogi Bear.  This is such a lack of love in this.  George was the boss.  Make no mistake.  Like, he built the Yankees into champions, and that's something nobody can ever deny.  Nice personal touch, Yogi.  Jesus.  Yogi.  Yeah.  He put his pants on one leg at a time. 
[00:05:30]  Did he?  Fucking idiot.  Shut up.  Where's our machines today?  Oh, look at that.  You don't have your machine yet.  Probably loading it up with some fun new sound.  Jason Alexander has a fine celebrity tweet.  The fact that he allowed himself and his beloved team to be satirized on our show is an indication  to me of his true character.  Why wouldn't he want the number one show on television to feature the Yankees?  I'm starting to think Twitter is a complete waste of time. 
[00:06:00]  It really is.  It's just a joke.  Any other good ones in here you like?  I haven't looked at any.  I think they're all terrible.  First of all, I'm trying to find a real celebrity in this fucking group.  Hey, Jimmy.  No.  No, except for Jimmy.  I mean, come on.  You don't start with the big one.  Jerry Jones.  From an interest level, baseball was always better when the profile and the performance  of the New York Yankees were at a high level.  And George always made sure that was the case.  Yeah.  What garbage?  Who's going to read this shite? 
[00:06:30]  Mayor Bloomberg tweeted.  Oh, no.  Thank God Mayor Bloomberg has time to fucking tweet.  Or are these quotes?  Is this Twitter?  No, it's a combination.  We'll say Twitter.  Is it a combo?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I can't imagine.  We like people who compete and who want to win and want to win honestly and fairly.  And I think that's exactly what George tried to do.  Yeah.  Like you won the last election fair?  Yeah, he pretty much cheated his way to his third term.  Where you just fucking made a new rule that you could run again?  Yeah.  Got it. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, we're dumb.  We just allowed it to happen.  No one really challenged that.  Why put it to a vote?  I don't think anyone else wanted to be the mayor of this shithole.  Here's a horrendous one.  Oh.  Here's Bill and Hillary Clinton really adding that personal touch.  They say that if you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere.  And nobody knew that as well as George Steinbrenner.  Are you saying that nobody knew that in addition to George Steinbrenner?  Nobody and Steinbrenner knew it?  Or they're saying nobody knew that as well as he did? 
[00:07:30]  No one knew that as well as George Steinbrenner.  Even though there was a song written about it?  Everyone knew it.  Stupid asses.  This is why this world is lame.  I mean, if I ran a paper, I would just run tweets from people that hated his fucking guts.  Yeah.  And I'm sure there's a bunch of ex-players that would come out of the woodwork with their fine tweets.  Oh.  If you nudged him a little bit, right?  Billy Martin tweeted.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  How do you spell that in 140 characters? 
[00:08:00]  I know.  It's very difficult, but he got it in.  All right.  Well, George Steinbrenner has passed.  There's a special tribute in this paper.  Enough of the fucking 25-page pull-out section of the newspaper.  Who wants pictures of an owner?  That's what I'm saying.  Who wants pictures of an owner?  All right, I understand.  You know, the guy, big part of fucking New York as far as that.  But, I mean, a little too much coverage.  And I see that Mel Gibson's tape number three made page 23. 
[00:08:30]  Uh-oh.  Big drop-off from the first two movies.  You know what?  The first two tapes, I should say, he made.  Is it like The Godfather, The Godfather 2, and then The Godfather 3?  I'm starting to think that.  Is tape three as good?  I haven't heard it yet.  Well, he talks about the wetbacks.  All right.  The wetbacks get some...  That's good.  Some mentions in tape three, which we'll get to in a little while.  That is nice.  Well, George Steinbrenner, people continue to remember him today, Anthony.  He's dead?  He's dead.  And did you hear what Rush Limbaugh had to say? 
[00:09:00]  Kind of what you just said.  I read something.  I didn't hear it.  You know, and people are outraged that Rush Limbaugh kind of took some shots at Georgie.  What was his nickname?  Georgie something...  The Boss.  No, there was another...  It's called The Boss.  Georgie...  Who was called Georgie?  Oh.  I don't know.  I mean...  I'm thinking Susan Waldman now, so that means it's probably a player.  Susan Waldman.  All right, whatever.  I think I'm completely wrong. 
[00:09:30]  Wait, maybe you're all right.  Posada?  You don't have to spend time on this.  It's Posada.  Posada.  She calls him Georgie.  Georgie.  Jorge, yeah.  All right.  This is what Rush Limbaugh had to say.  And people are outraged, but I think he's...  Oh, please.  I think he's right on target with this.  George Steinbrenner has passed away at age 80.  That cracker made a lot of African-American millionaires.  If he says cracker, though, he should say Jigaboo.  We're trying to bring Jigaboo back because it's so ridiculous.  You know what? 
[00:10:00]  Rush Limbaugh...  Rush doesn't care anymore.  He doesn't care.  He cares by saying African-Americans.  If you say cracker, then you say the equivalent, which would probably be old-school Jigaboo or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Colored.  Something like that, right?  Negro.  I just don't understand why...  And believe me, I love race.  I love talking about it and thinking about it.  Yes, always.  I don't understand.  I mean, he's only heard one line.  That's probably why.  What happened?  I don't know what he's talking about. 
[00:10:30]  He made a lot of black guys a lot of money, I guess.  White guys money, too.  Yeah.  He made a manly 20 million.  Exactly.  George Steinbrenner has passed away at age 80.  That cracker made a lot of African-American millionaires.  He...  Every...  George Steinbrenner, the classic capitalist.  Everybody around him became wealthy.  And like most successful capitalists, he made the people around him wealthy.  And a lot of African-American millionaires along the way. 
[00:11:00]  And at the same time, he fired a bunch of white guys as managers, left and right.  I'll tell you what, it's...  It's...  You know, it's...  Steinbrenner hasn't been himself for the past two or three years.  But nevertheless, what a man he was.  And what a feature and a character he was in Major League Baseball.  Well, you know what?  That wasn't even worth playing.  That sucked.  He got a lot of work out of the spooks. 
[00:11:30]  What is he...  Isn't Rush Limbaugh on...  He's just...  He's on like 1,200 radio stations, I think.  Yeah.  And that's all he had on fucking Steinbrenner?  He was just trying to be a little outrageous.  There was no reason to mention...  Race had...  It was a completely worthless time.  Yeah, yeah.  It was worthless.  That's what he said.  What are you talking about?  What are you doing, Rush?  Yeah.  It's not offensive.  It was just dumb.  No, it was definitely dumb.  Yeah, there was no...  Now, you want to talk race.  Talk about that.  They just showed the two Black Panthers standing outside the polling place during the Obama election. 
[00:12:00]  Trying to help.  That was good.  They were helping.  You know what I've noticed of late?  I did a little podcast last night, just for an hour.  However, everybody is trying so hard not to step on everyone's podcast.  It's like, I had to squeeze mine in between Joe Rogan's, and then Joe Rogan is a guest on another one.  Oh, really?  And then I didn't want to step on Louie's show that was coming on. 
[00:12:30]  It's so...  You have to schedule your podcast now so you're not stepping on your pals.  Just turn on your TriCaster and broadcast.  That's pretty much it.  But then you realize it's like, oh, shit, Rogan's up.  We live in an on-demand world.  Don't worry about it.  That's pretty much what it is.  Don't worry about it.  I just want to tell you the truth.  I just kind of actually wanted to watch Rogan.  So he just hangs out.  Yeah, he hangs with his body.  Probably stoned.  He does a great podcast.  And just, their subject probably lasts for 10 seconds. 
[00:13:00]  And then they're on to some other cosmic event.  Well, they got a little ADD going on there.  It's fantastic.  They got a little ADD going on.  I was cracking up.  Hey, before we move on from the Steinbrenner thing, though,  one of our own came in with a Yankees jersey.  Oh, we have a heartbroken employee here, do we?  Yes.  It's Love Buzz.  Love Buzz.  Love Buzz hasn't been on the show a lot.  He's an intern that's really stupid.  He's been on enough, though, where people kind of know who he is. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, you think?  Like, yeah, what's his most dumb moment on the program?  Well, he came in with a Lakers jersey once, or a Lakers shirt,  and said he was a huge fan of the Lakers and had nothing to say about the Lakers.  He could barely name who was on the team.  But Love Buzz, I see you're wearing a Yankees jersey.  Actually, a Mattingly Yankees jersey.  Yeah.  And I would assume it's because George Steinbrenner passed away.  That's one of the reasons why.  Yeah, and you were telling me just before the show that you're a big Yankees fan. 
[00:14:00]  I am a Yankees fan.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, I am.  So that's why you're paying tribute with a Yankees jersey.  Could you name the starting lineup of the Yankees?  Let's see.  I don't know the exact order, but there's Jeter, there's Teixeira.  You've got Teixeira on first, Cano on second, Jeter shortstop, A-Rod third.  Cervelli's the catcher.  Brett Gardner's in the outfield.  Where's Posada?  Is he hurt?  I think he is hurt.  Thank you.  He's on the DL.  Thank you.  He's no kid anymore. 
[00:14:30]  Okay.  Hey, you've got to get mad.  You're proving that he's a fan.  You're watching the team.  Yeah.  And you were a big fan of George Steinbrenner?  Yeah.  Why?  Why did you like George?  Yeah, give us some of your memories and thoughts of George Steinbrenner.  He's such an asshole to, like, the people he, like, the people that work for him.  You're listening.  I thought it was pretty funny.  You're listening to me.  Hoo-hoo.  He was such an asshole?  Yeah, he was an asshole to people. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  He just fires people.  Fired Billy Martin five times.  I thought that's pretty funny.  He just kept on bringing him back, fucked up his life some more.  Well, don't you think Billy Martin is the dope in that situation to keep coming back to  the asshole boss?  George wasn't the one dumping Miller Lights down Billy's throat.  This is also true.  He also wasn't driving the car.  I'm sure he would have preferred Billy wasn't drinking.  Yeah.  Maybe he was trying to make a point that Billy never got.  Yeah.  Maybe Billy's drinking made his job difficult.  Right.  I don't recall George almost having a fist fight with Thurman Munson and Reggie. 
[00:15:30]  In the middle of a game.  Yeah.  God, the good old days.  They were trying to play baseball here, Billy.  Why are you making it about you right now?  Oh, the good old days.  What was the big one?  Was it when he yanked Reggie Jackson?  Billy, when he called him in from the outfield.  Called him in from the outfield and there was almost fucking fist fighting.  Oh, they were fucking...  They were ready to duke it out in front of the dugout.  Yeah, I think he wanted Reggie to bunt and Reggie wouldn't bunt.  I think it's...  No, I think Reggie was in the outfield. 
[00:16:00]  He didn't go hard to catch the ball.  Oh, you know what?  He's right.  And the ball fell right in front of him.  You are right because why else would he have called him in from the outfield over a bunt?  I like being corrected by someone who doesn't even know the mic should be talking to.  Sorry, Jimmy.  No, it's okay.  You're right.  Just your mic technique is terrible.  What else you got on George Steinbrenner?  We're counting on you because everyone's remembering George Steinbrenner today and we're using you for that today.  Hold me, yes.  Love Buzz Sterling.  So what exactly was it?  Who was it they wanted to bunt?  When did that happen?  What happened when he wanted him to bunt and he wouldn't bunt?  I'm not sure about the bunting thing.  I just know the reason why he pulled Reggie was because he didn't go hard for the fly ball. 
[00:16:30]  Okay.  Wow.  All right, guys.  I think he put Mickey Rivers in for him.  Damn.  Yeah.  Blackest baseball player ever.  Oh, yeah.  It's very dark, man.  I'm not talking about his hair.  I'm just talking about his color.  Oh.  I think he was the blackest baseball player ever to play the game.  Mickey ran out to fucking right field fucking waving a limb he had cut off in a fucking civil unrest.  He also had a bit of a gambling problem.  Who?  Mickey Rivers.  Oh, did he?  And his wife had to take over his finances. 
[00:17:00]  This is really bizarre that Love Buzz actually knows something.  I know.  These are things I want to know, too.  Yeah, no kidding.  What do you got on Mickey Rivers gambling problem?  That's all I know.  It's just he was a big gambler and his wife took over everything.  Every paycheck just went to her.  So what happened to Mickey Rivers?  I don't know what happened to him after that.  Why don't you Google Mickey Rivers for us and come back with a report?  Okay.  A full report on Mickey Rivers.  I'll be right back.  No, no.  I want to know about Mattingly, though.  You got the Mattingly jersey on.  Well, my earliest memories of baseball was Don Mattingly. 
[00:17:30]  He was the only Yankee I knew when I first started watching baseball.  Well, how old are you?  I'm 21.  You do realize that Mattingly retired, I think.  95.  That's 15 years ago.  Yeah.  So you're six years old.  For his last season.  And that's his last season.  I mean, in his prime, you were zero.  And now you're one again.  I guess so.  So you're watching Mattingly.  I just remember Mattingly. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah?  Nothing special about him.  I just remember Don Mattingly.  Did he touch you?  No, Don Mattingly didn't touch me.  I'm just wondering why the memories...  Whatever he thinks of Mattingly is, Heine gets warm and heated up and really sore.  It's like a warm, hot poker being shoved into his young bottle.  Got it right on the nose there.  And so Mattingly is one of your favorite players, even though you barely remember seeing him play.  Yeah.  What was his nickname?  Donnie Baseball.  No, it wasn't.  Oh.  Not that one.  Never won a championship. 
[00:18:30]  That's right.  Yeah.  I think the year before his rookie year, didn't they win a championship?  Wow.  Look at you.  And then the year after he retired.  Maybe the year before his rookie year.  Yeah.  Wait, the year before his rookie year...  I think his rookie year is 82.  And then 96.  And then the year right after he retired, they went on their run.  Oh, my God.  Got some fucked up luck there.  I saw Mattingly's last home run in the stadium.  I was at that game.  It was against the Mariners in 95, the playoff series.  They won the first two games and then promptly lost the next three. 
[00:19:00]  That's when five-game playoff series were two and three.  And they lost three in a row in Seattle, as we knew they would.  Do you remember that, Love Buzz?  I vaguely remember the Seattle series.  Were you pissing your pants?  The Yankees didn't win the 81 series.  I probably was then.  I was a young lad.  What happened?  The Yankees didn't win the 81 series.  So Love Buzz is wrong about that?  No, they were in it, but they lost to the Dodgers.  So, all right.  Mattingly started in the league, what, 82 then?  Yeah, it was 82.  So Yankees, the last time they won the World Series before 82 was what?  79, 78, somewhere around there. 
[00:19:30]  I think it was the 77 season, right?  So 70, uh, 70...  77, 78, they won?  Yeah, 77, 78.  Right.  Okay.  All right, so I was a little off.  It was important, though.  Honestly, it did pretty well.  I'm kind of bummed that this didn't work out as well as I wanted, which was for you to look like a complete asshole.  Because he still, even though he knows stuff, he still looks stupid.  Right.  So I have no problem with that.  I'll take it.  Who else is wearing Yankee attire around here today? 
[00:20:00]  We have intern Joe, who's wearing a Yankee hat.  Yeah, I see the Yankee hat.  And did I see Steve C. wearing a Yankee hat?  I just passed by really quickly.  No, he wasn't wearing a Yankee hat.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  It was a Yank-me hat.  Yeah, Yankee cranky hat.  Yes.  Yes, yeah.  All of a sudden, everybody's the Yankees.  How come no one's wearing a stadium shirt or something? 
[00:20:30]  I don't get it.  What?  It gets mad.  People want to go back to the Rush Limbaugh statement.  Do they?  Sal in Jersey.  Sal.  Hey, Sal.  Hey, Sal.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey.  Good morning.  You guys rule.  Jimmy, you're the man.  Thank you, of course.  And, hey, Opany, congratulations again.  It's the first time I thought you guys were on.  What's an Opany?  Opany.  I know.  Opany and Anthony.  Remember that one.  A long-time listener.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you. 
[00:21:00]  I had heard an interview that this freakoid Shabazz Shabazz did from the New Black Liberation  Front where he talked about hating crackers and despising the white man and racist crap.  And I think Rush Limbaugh was really kind of spoofing up.  You guys need to be told.  Yeah, maybe he was doing that.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  A big spoof, I believe, on Shabazz Shabazz.  Okay.  Shabazz Shabazz.  Whatever his name is.  Is it Malik Shabazz?  Malik Shabazz.  Because he's trying to... 
[00:21:30]  La-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Shabazz Ball.  I love you.  I'm heading into the tunnel now.  All right.  He's trying so hard to be a radical Malik Shabazz because he looks...  Because that was Malcolm X's...  I think Malcolm X, after he went to Mecca, became Al-Hajj, Malik, Al-Shabazz.  Yeah.  And he had the...  And, you know, this guy's got the glasses.  He's trying so hard.  He's trying.  They are really trying.  This new Black Panther movement.  They are trying so hard to be someone.  And I hate the fucking media that they're playing them up like almost legitimate right now. 
[00:22:00]  They're not goofing on them, not calling them a hate group.  I was comparing them to the Klan.  I was comparing them to the Ku Klux Klan.  They're a group that is specifically there to intimidate people of another race.  They are there to intimidate white people.  The Klan is there to intimidate black people.  Both groups have their history in killing, in bombings. 
[00:22:30]  The Black Panthers, how many police did they kill?  How many government buildings were bombed back in the 60s and 70s?  It's the same thing.  It's extremists on both sides that don't quite have the numbers they really need to do a lot  because most people have enough fucking sense in their head, you know?  But they're just...  But the media not calling them out as a hate group, which is what they are, annoys me. 
[00:23:00]  Why aren't they showing...  If there was a Ku Klux Klan member in full regalia standing in front of a polling place  with a weapon in his hand, even if it was a stick, whatever the fuck it is,  he would not only be brought up on charges of intimidating voters,  he would have been dragged the fuck out of there.  The second someone saw him, the cops would have dragged him away.  But they were able to actually stand there.  And it's...  You're right, though.  The way the media is looking at it is the way they mock the Tea Partiers 
[00:23:30]  and the way they editorialize with it.  It really is kind of sickening.  The way they're not at least going after...  Could you label this fucking new Black Panthers group as a hate group?  They are a hate group.  As much as the KKK is, they are.  And the NAACP, that irrelevant group of fucking buffoons...  I agree.  ...are coming out against the Tea Party and saying that they're racist.  I guess they had some kind of vote. 
[00:24:00]  And they voted them racist.  Why?  Because they don't want your president elected in 2012?  Is that why?  Because the midterm elections are coming up and you're getting a little skittish  on the way the polls are looking?  So they come out against the Tea Partiers,  who, by the way, are predominantly white  because they're fucking working, tax-paying people  that don't want their asses taxed shut.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:24:30]  But there are Black Tea Partiers in there.  Every group is represented.  But it's mostly people that just don't want to be fucked  over and over again by the administration.  So, of course, because the administration is now run by a black guy,  the NAACP's got to come out and say that it's a racist organization.  Fuck you.  You're a racist organization.  Irrelevant.  Irrelevant for a hundred and fucking, what, nine years?  They really have begun to stink.  The NAACP, I think, served as very important at one point. 
[00:25:00]  And now it's like the funeral for the N-word.  It's just the race card they throw around at every given moment.  And the fact that Michelle Obama spoke at their 109th anniversary there  when they were doing this, when they were holding a vote  whether to condemn Tea Partiers as being racist,  is just, that's outrageous, too. 
[00:25:30]  What the fuck is she doing there during that?  You know, it's beyond me.  And this does annoy me, that they're spending money.  The country's in trouble here, financially.  Yep.  But they're going to fucking give these scumbag lawyers,  I guess the Department of Justice,  whoever it is that would have to sue Arizona.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And also they're suing John Stalliano, butt man.  That's what they're doing.  They're trying to get him put in jail for his fuck movies.  Yeah, for his fuck movies.  That's where the government is spending money.  He makes movies where cum shoots all over people. 
[00:26:00]  It's fun.  And that's what the, he went on trial as of yesterday,  and they're trying to get him 30 years in jail.  And meanwhile, they're trying to have charges dropped  against the fucking Black Panthers for voter intimidation.  For voter intimidation.  Not trying, they did.  They did.  They dropped the charges, and it's based purely on race.  Another lawyer came out and said he was told that, specifically.  A lawyer that was involved in the fucking case.  Another thing Michelle Obama did, goes down to the Gulf Coast,  talks about how it's vacation time and time to come down 
[00:26:30]  and support the Gulf Coast, take the kids out there,  show people an image that it's not all bad everywhere,  and spend your money down there.  And then they promptly made plans to vacation in Maine.  Did they?  Oh, of course.  Another vacation for Obama as far away from the Gulf as you can get.  He should set a good example and get on that beach.  Of course he should.  With all the tar balls.  It's just crazy.  What is Michelle Obama the mayor of Jaws? 
[00:27:00]  You're getting that water.  Hey, Rape Kid wants in on this.  Rape Kid.  Rape Kid, what a terrific name.  How are you, sir?  Good.  Anthony, listen, I just wanted to let you know  that your anger is a little misdirected,  Obama and Eric Holder and his administration.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, because your anger should really be  during the Bush administration,  in his lame duck term,  when, you know, the election happened,  when he was actually president.  Yeah.  That no one during his administration  prosecuted the Black Panthers 
[00:27:30]  for intimidating at the polls.  You say nothing of the fact  that Obama was even president  when it happened.  Oh, would you stop it?  Look, you know who those people,  you know what those people were doing  in front of that polling place.  They weren't intimidating,  they weren't intimidating Obama's voters.  Just stop it.  Hold on, can I ask a question, sir?  Didn't they have,  didn't the Bush Department of Justice  go after these guys  and actually get charges brought against them, 
[00:28:00]  and then after it changed hands,  then it was dropped.  Then the Obama administration  had them dropped,  so I think you're wrong, sir.  You can research it.  The charges were never brought up  during Bush's administration.  But wasn't his administration  over by January?  Yeah, and the election  was in November, Jimmy.  No, no, no, I understand that,  but didn't his people  kind of start the ball rolling?  No, there was nothing,  there was nothing started  during the Bush administration.  The actual court,  prosecution,  the everything that was... 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, and Holder dropped  and Holder dropped the charges.  That's all.  That's all.  I don't give a shit.  I'm not going to sit here  and play Blame Bush game  after two fucking years in office.  I'm not playing  the Blame Bush game anymore, okay?  Neither am I.  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not.  Clam up, rape kid.  I'm just trying to say  your fucking anger  is a little misdirected.  No, it's not misdirected.  It's perfectly directed  at the people  that you should be angry at.  Oh, Anthony, you know what? 
[00:29:00]  Oh, go ahead.  Blame is not nearly as...  As effective as any president  that's ever been  in the White House.  You're right, you're right.  ...or as liberal  as you project in the beach.  You are out of your fucking mind.  He's continuing...  You know what he is?  He was a campaigner.  He was a campaigner  and not a president.  He's not an effective president.  He was an effective campaign...  You're right.  ...and speech...  ...and speech reader.  But that doesn't make him  as racial and as liberal...  Oh, it absolutely does.  A point to the... 
[00:29:30]  Oh, him with his stupid  fucking church  that he had to throw  his preacher under the bus  and just...  Enough.  Enough.  Of course, it's very racially based.  And I think you're...  Right, and he's gonna take away...  And he's gonna take away your guns  because he's allowing them  in a lot of places that...  He's allowing them  in more places  than they were allowed before.  He's not, asshole.  Oh, come on.  He's not.  If he wanted to...  If he wanted to...  He could put his attention...  Oh, oh.  If he wanted to lose... 
[00:30:00]  If he wanted to lose  the entire vote?  Are you...  You're out of your fucking mind.  He's progressed  Bush's wiretaps.  He's decreased the security  in this country  as far as privacy.  You know, he's...  He's a hawk  as far as his position  on the war  to continue that.  You know, and despite the fact  that he says  he wants to withdraw in July...  Great.  He's a great president.  I don't...  What a great president, then.  You're right.  I think you're right.  I don't think he's a hawk. 
[00:30:30]  I think he just kind of  got caught out there.  Rape kit.  He's got no balls  is what he's got.  He's got no fucking balls.  Yeah.  I think he said something  that he was campaigning  and he realized  that that wasn't...  That would look horrible to do.  So I don't think  he's a hawk for the war.  I think he just got caught  out there campaigning  one way  and then the reality  of the situation  dictates he'd do something else.  That doesn't make you a hawk.  He got the vote  by saying what people  wanted to hear  and now he's not doing it.  Doesn't every politician  do that, Anthony?  Oh, well.  Isn't that a shame? 
[00:31:00]  Because he inspired  so many people.  He's so inspired.  Where are the...  Oh, where are the swooning?  Where's the swooning?  Where's the love affair?  Oh, what happened?  What happened?  One-termer.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Rape Kid.  Maybe.  All right, good job.  I think he's wrong  about that Bush.  Department of Justice  did go after  the Black Panther Party.  Of course.  Why are we talking  about this  when Lindsay Lohan  is in danger?  She's in a lot of danger. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, fuck her.  I hope someone gets  a fucking plunger handle  up or twat  in the laundry room.  Hope Justin Volpe  takes care of her case.  Did someone just  pull the brake  on this radio show?  Oh, God.  Do I certainly hope  she gets some canned heat.  Some good...  You ever see that movie  Canned Heat?  Yeah, with...  Wasn't it...  Linda Blair.  Linda Blair was in that, right?  Oh, the matronly  laundry room woman.  This is why the world sucks  point number two today.  That's it.  There's so much shit 
[00:32:00]  going on in the world,  but we have to worry  that Lindsay Lohan  might get a broom  fucking shoved up  her pussy in jail.  Yeah, somebody was saying  she's in danger,  but the news teased it.  She's in danger by...  What is she in danger by?  Jailhouse gangs.  Jailhouse gangs.  Do you think  she's actually going to be put...  Jailhouse gangs might...  What do they want to do  to Lindsay Lohan?  She's going to serve a week.  What's the quote?  It was all over the place.  What everyone says  they want to do  to Lindsay Lohan?  Exactly.  Is that pretty much it?  They should film...  You're right.  She needs a movie role. 
[00:32:30]  They should film  a new fucking  canned heat.  Is this going to be  on MSNBC's Lockup?  Is she going to be featured?  Can you imagine?  I want to see that.  Is it Lockdown?  Lockup?  I don't know.  Fuck it is.  It's a prison show  that scares me.  But she's in danger.  Makes me not do  illegal things.  She's in danger.  She's very scared.  She's very scared  that her time in jail  could mean a lot of abuse  by big lesbian women.  She could be diddled.  Right. 
[00:33:00]  She could be diddled.  There was one scene...  Candy?  What is it?  No, no.  Come on.  No, it was in...  I think it was in Oz.  Yes, where there was  so much cock  even in the opening sequence.  This chick was on death row  and she just...  She fucking pulls her  pants down  or whatever the fuck  she was wearing  and backed up  to the bars.  Backed up to the bars, yes.  And just let a guard  fuck her to the bars.  That's a classic move.  I was looking just going...  Yeah, that's pretty fucking...  That's pretty hot.  That's kind of a hot scene  right there. 
[00:33:30]  And what prison guard  isn't going in for taste?  Of course he's going to do.  Well, maybe not a taste.  I mean, you know...  He's going to dip.  I mean, you know...  I don't know if it's too clean  down there for a taste.  Ugh.  Ugh, no.  But for a good shtick.  That was her.  She was in the hole  and she got it in the hole.  Shirley Bellinger.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, really?  I know my Oz.  You know your Oz?  Oh, it's changed heat?  Not canned heat?  No.  Caged heat?  I thought it was canned heat.  Wait.  Is it chained heat? 
[00:34:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  Carlos in Jersey.  Hey, Carlos.  Canned heat's the band.  Hey, it's...  Yeah, it's changed heat.  It was like part one, two, three...  Caged heat.  It's caged heat.  Yeah, it was like soft porn, man.  Back in the day,  it was awesome when you were a kid.  Yeah, I loved the soft porn.  Big fan of the soft porn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, look at that.  Women's Prison, USA, Rape, Riot, and Revenge.  That's right on the movie poster?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:34:30]  God, those movies, they got to bring back that genre.  Yeah.  Remember when the warden needed a little, like, yard work done?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, why don't you come by my place?  They'd be in the yard, raking and stuff,  with white t-shirts, no bras.  Yep.  What a wonderful movie that was.  It was just hotness.  Then you'd bring one lucky girl into the house.  Ooh.  What was that?  Well, that's a girl's topless. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, going in with their big hairy bushes  and their boobies into the shower  to soap each other up.  So we don't...  What's the Lindsay quote?  We don't have it?  Oh, I was looking at Caged Heat stuff.  Yeah, I don't blame you.  A quote.  When you Google image canned heat,  some good stuff comes up.  By the way, Lovebuzz had all his Yankees info wrong.  Oh, didn't he?  And we should acknowledge that there isn't a 77-78 season. 
[00:35:30]  It's all played in one fucking year.  But wasn't it two years?  Was it 77 and 78?  That they won?  That they were in it.  They might have been in it, but they only won it.  Okay, here it is.  Lindsay Lohan is lesbian meat.  Oh.  Oh.  And what does it say under that?  That's just the headline that gets you interested in the story.  Why don't you read that one, Dan?  With only a week left until she goes to jail for less than five minutes,  lesbian gangs are already salivating at the opportunity 
[00:36:00]  to get a piece of Lindsay Lohan, which makes perfect sense.  This is not a real story.  No.  This is not a real story.  Do you honestly think they're going to put her anywhere where she's in any danger?  Lesbian gangs?  It's like when Paris Hilton went to jail for ten minutes.  Right.  And cried about it and then made millions off it.  That's what's going to happen with this Lindsay Lohan with her big, heavy breast.  Jesus.  What does it say after the lesbian gangs are already salivating?  This is from The Superficial. 
[00:36:30]  According to my sources, one ginger vagina is worth roughly twice the smokes  because of its patented devil magic.  That sounds like great prison lingo right there.  Wait, can you read that again?  That was one of the greatest sentences I've ever heard in my life.  According to my sources, one ginger vagina is worth roughly twice the smokes  because of its patented devil magic.  Devil magic?  Damn.  Wow.  That sounds hot.  It does sound hot. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, you're right.  She'll be in jail a few weeks, and then she'll come out,  and she'll make a shitload of money off the fact.  They're going to put her somewhere nice.  She's going to fucking have a little job to do.  She's going to have to, you know, run the library.  She'll get out.  She'll stand on a chair and hang herself.  Dummy was here.  Waste of space.  Enough about Lindsay Lohan.  Lindsay Lohan.  Lindsay Lohan.  All right, well, that's a fine start to the show, huh? 
[00:37:30]  Did a little George Steinbrenner action as the world remembers him,  the baseball world, Anthony?  Thank God.  You feel like everyone should move on already,  even though it hasn't been a complete day yet since we learned the news?  You know what?  They don't really give that kind of gusto as far as tributes go to a lot of other people that die  that are, I think, even a little more well-known.  No, they give gusto to all these fucking guys that die. 
[00:38:00]  Come on.  They can't wait.  They can't wait to throw the coverage at you.  Come on.  This is, like, huge, though.  The big fold-outs, the fucking, you know, pre-empting Seinfeld.  Come on.  We saw that episode 80 times.  Who played George Steinbrenner?  Was it Larry David?  It was, right?  Larry David.  Yeah, Larry David in the chair backwards.  Funny.  Have you seen the deleted scenes where he actually,  or Steinbrenner, filmed scenes? 
[00:38:30]  Oh, he did?  Yeah, he filmed a whole, like, episode,  but they cut the scenes out for time reasons,  and they're, like, on the extras on season seven or something.  Oh!  They took Elaine out to dinner.  I thought I saw all the extras.  Was he awful?  Yeah, he's not the best actor.  And T-Storm.  It's on YouTube.  T-Storm knows everything about Seinfeld.  Why are you calling him T-Storm?  I kind of like it.  I thought everybody.  Why?  T-Storm.  It was T-Storm.  Cavdog is dead and long live T-Storm. 
[00:39:00]  T-Storm.  What is that based on?  It doesn't matter where the names come from.  The most inane thing I've ever heard, but it just stuck.  Didn't he say that there was going to be T-Storms?  Yeah, I was checking the weather one day last week,  and I said, oh, T-Storm's in the afternoon.  And Danny said, what's a T-Storm?  And I said, oh, I'm a T-Storm.  And he's like, yeah, you're a T-Storm.  You're a T-Storm.  You did it to yourself.  And he hates it.  Why?  You were reading the paper.  You used a little abbreviation, and that's...  Well, that's what the paper said.  And then the T for Travis, so now he's T-Storm. 
[00:39:30]  T-Storm.  Yeah.  All right.  Perfect.  All right.  Take that with you.  Why don't you like it?  I'd like that.  T-Bone!  Breaking news.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No, don't even say.  Oh.  No, nothing bad.  Oh.  Tiger Woods has retired his putter.  He's going to be using a new putter during the British Open.  Really?  That's big news today.  Is he going to use one of those big, tall ones that you swing like a pendulum? 
[00:40:00]  I hate those big, dumb putters.  Oh, man.  You're so right about that.  They look stupid.  If you need one of those big, giant putters because your back hurts that badly, then you  know what?  How about you retire?  Because you'll look ridiculous on the greens.  He'll quit the game.  Right.  You look completely ridiculous.  But yeah, everyone's talking about the fact that Tiger Woods will be using a new putter.  Wow.  This world has just lost its way.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Lost its way.  But God bless the British press.  They're not letting the Tiger shit pass like they're doing in America.  They're asking him all sorts of questions about his personal life.  They love scandal.  And what he went through.  Love scandal over there.  They're like, look, you do what you want in America, but we still want some answers here.  How about Britain go fuck themselves and give us answers?  How about that fucking shit country?  Give us answers on why this fucking Libyan terrorist is out.  And a London cancer specialist that Libya paid to diagnose him last year confessed recently  that he fudged the prognosis to help the Libyans. 
[00:41:00]  And these fucking cunts from BP are going to start drilling in Libyan waters.  And this guy being released was a part of it.  I guess their national hero.  Jimmy.  What, it was a whole thing they were doing?  He was released because he was dying.  They're saying he's going to live another 10 years?  This guy's fucking fine.  He's fine.  How about...  He probably does have some form of cancer.  But fuck Scotland.  How about we pick it out on fucking Britain?  Yeah.  How about we have an economic problem or some kind of an international thing with Britain? 
[00:41:30]  They're the ones who fucking had him released.  They are our number one ally in the world, Jimmy.  Very political, this whole thing.  We can't step on each other's toesies.  Well, they didn't mind kicking us in the fucking dick over this.  Fuck them.  Fuck Britain.  Aw, poor Lindsay.  But guys, breaking news.  Inmates speak out on Lindsay Lohan going to jail.  That's the big story on Fox 5 here in New York.  And they're taking it seriously, these dumb fucking newsreaders.  I'm pissed off at...  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Back to Britain.  I'm pissed off at British Petroleum, too. 
[00:42:00]  BP.  Because I bought their stock yesterday.  And you got killed.  No, I didn't get killed.  But what happened, they're supposed to be testing out their little cap.  And they're delaying testing.  Which is just going to fuck everything up.  Because now it seems like they're a little wishy-washy.  And basically the stock would have went down a little more for you.  I see what you're saying.  If the cap would have worked and been on schedule, it would have been good.  See, they're going to cap this thing off.  And there's this cap now with a bunch of valves on it and shit. 
[00:42:30]  Because they're not sure if they just cap it off that the rest of this wellhead is just going to bust apart from the pressure.  So they're going to cap it.  And it's got a bunch of valves.  And the little robots are going to turn one valve, turn a little another valve, and slowly shut this thing down as they keep pressure testing the rest of the rig to make sure it doesn't just explode.  And they were supposed to start testing.  And now they've, for no reason, said, well, we're not going to start testing quite just yet.  We've got to figure something out. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, boy.  Which means Anthony bought at the wrong time.  You bought a little early.  I bought a little early.  But I'm feeling good about it.  Feeling good at capitalizing on some dead fucking birds.  Fuck Britain.  That's what Jimmy says today.  Fuck Britain.  Holy shit.  Look at you, a patriot.  Oh, they really annoy me.  You should have your little flute and your headband on.  My little drum.  My little drum. 
[00:43:30]  Fife.  Fife and drum.  That's little Jimmy.  Fuck the British.  That's a second embarrassment to me.  Yeah.  Yes.  No.  You would make me want to smoke.  You fucked my day up.  You care about yourself.  I love it.  Is and I will in there? 
[00:44:00]  And I will?  Oh, it's great.  I don't know if I got that one.  How about the smile?  Well, I got you.  Blow me.  Blow me.  It's great.  He didn't put the smile part in?  No.  Why would he?  That's...  What the fuck is that?  But that's the quote.  The quote is just smile and blow me.  How did he take out the just smile?  Because that's the funny one.  Anyone can just say blow me. 
[00:44:30]  I'm sorry.  You should just fucking smile and blow me.  Because I deserve it.  See, okay.  He broke it up.  He broke it up.  Blow me.  Blow me.  Blow me.  Blow me.  You know, why don't we go to break with a Mel Gibson remix?  Game on, by the way.  I don't know if we got any new ones today, but game fucking on.  You take the Mel Gibson audio and remix it with something.  Which one do you want in here?  There's a new tape, too, right?  Yeah, we'll play the new tape after the break if you'd like. 
[00:45:00]  I don't know.  I love the remix.  Anyone.  We got the Pat O'Brien and we got the Terry Schiavo so far.  Pat O'Brien.  They were both great.  Pat O'Brien had a dialogue back and forth.  That was great.  Okay.  Also, the Q104 criminal is loose.  Yeah, yeah.  This is beyond all reality.  I can't even chew my eggs.  Can you believe it?  The Q104 criminal is loose and we need to fucking capture him.  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  Regular radio needs our help once again today.  Again.  We have to help.  And the FCC takes it in the shitter.  We'll explain after the break as well.  Very good news for broadcasters.  Yep.  And free speech in general, I believe.  Right?  Yep.  So we'll get into that as well.  But first, this fine remix.  Hey, it's me.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  What?  I don't want you to suck my god.  What?  I want to fuck you.  You need a fucking pat on the side of the head. 
[00:46:00]  All right?  How about that?  I'm so fucking hot.  Fuck you.  I'm so fucking hot.  Fuck you.  You make my life so fucking difficult.  Get out to this relationship if you love me.  Has any relationship ever worked with you?  I fucking have sex, and I want to make you cum so much.  Get straight and why I'm like this.  You don't care.  You don't care.  I left my life because we had no spiritual common ground.  You and I have none. 
[00:46:30]  Zero.  You won't even fucking try.  I don't want you badly.  I know you want me.  What?  You agree with anything I've said, just say yes to me.  No!  You have no fucking soul.  You make me want to smoke.  You fuck my damn.  You care about yourself.  Let's have fun.  I want to fucking fuck you and lick your ass.  What?  I need someone who fucking treats me like a man.  Like a human being with kindness.  I'm so fucking into you.  It's incredible.  Let's just fucking have fun. 
[00:47:00]  You need a fucking doctor.  You need a fucking brain transplant.  You need a fucking soul.  How about that?  Get it?  You get it now?  Oh.  You can't give a fuck.  I don't do this for a living.  This is like new to me.  You're a dishonest cunt.  But I want to fucking make it crazy.  I just fucking have sex and fun.  Drugs.  You should just fucking smile and blow me! 
[00:47:30]  Because I deserve it!  Obi-Wan, the show on the virus.  Series XM.  There, there, there.  Wow.  How's your asshole, Anthony?  Ah, it's a little like the oil rig.  It's got to be capped.  Kind of looked like an oil leak in the, uh, in the can.  You rarely leave the studio during, uh, the breaks.  And when you do, boy, it's a doozy.  It might have been the chips and salsa for dinner. 
[00:48:00]  That's pretty much all I had.  That's all you ate?  Yeah, see, you know what?  Here's what happened.  I had that giant party over the house.  Yeah.  Um, on, uh, Sunday.  And then, Keith took all the food.  He took all the food out of the fridge.  It was his party, right?  Yeah, but, you know.  Could leave, uh, leave me a little something to eat.  Because my cook, cook, uh, isn't coming till today.  Ah.  Ah, so, I could have ordered something, but, ah, I was, like, you know, busy. 
[00:48:30]  So, what the fuck?  And then, I'm like, alright, I have a little salsa left.  I got some corn chips.  So, I sat there with some chips and salsa.  And now, um, it is, it is firing out.  I'm not making any predictions on when my ass will be sealed.  I heard it.  I was in the bathroom talking to E-Rock, and then he left.  And I just heard,  P-de-loop.  P-de-loop.  I was fucking, did you hear me laughing?  Of course I did. 
[00:49:00]  I wanted, I wasn't 100% sure it was Ant.  So, I couldn't, you know, it's like, you don't want to harass somebody in the bathroom.  I just heard Jimmy go, ugh.  Oh, yeah, I did go, ugh.  He went, ugh.  This place has to hate us.  Because then I look at Danny, I go, Danny, how much time do I got?  Because I have to take my little, uh, you know, movement or whatever.  And, uh, and I'm eating my multi-grain Cheerios with blueberries.  Oh, God.  And Danny goes, why don't you fucking, you know, go to the bathroom and eat at the same  time?  Like, that's a great idea.  And then Danny goes, I was kidding. 
[00:49:30]  There's no fucking way.  Because, I was like, well, I, you know, he's like, do I have time to go to the bathroom?  Because I'm eating.  And I'm just like, well, just eat your cereal on the ball.  Then he just goes, okay.  And he starts, people don't understand out there.  We get like five, six, sometimes we stretch it.  We'll be honest with you.  But, uh, not, not much time in between the breaks.  And then you have to decide what's more important, taking the morning dump or eating.  So in this case, I'm like, you know what, Danny?  Goddamn, you make a good point.  So then I walk into the bathroom.  There's a lot of guys from other radio shows in there.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:50:00]  And I got my bowl of cereal and I sit on the bowl to take a dump and eat at the same time.  That is fucked.  Yeah, but then I'm listening to you two stalls away and, and just water's pouring out of you.  Well, I was trying to flush at the same time.  What a fucking nightmare in there today.  And, and also, yeah, I don't want to be the guy that's like, you know, oh, Jesus, God, the guy in Stole 1.  Jesus, fuck God, you got to look out for him.  So I like, I'll, I'll wait, I'll wait for a little bit until the bathroom's empty. 
[00:50:30]  And then I'll, I'll full bore it.  So now with the iPhone, you put the iPhone down, you snap a picture all the way down the whole floor  of the, the stalls, then you can lift it up and see if anyone's in any of the stalls or if they're empty.  Now, if they're empty, open the chute.  You're a weirdo.  You really are.  You are a weirdo.  I just don't want to be the guy that's like.  Just open up your asshole and fucking dump.  I hate that.  Taking bathroom cam photos.  I don't want to be creepy.  So I photograph the stall floor. 
[00:51:00]  You can be, you can be fired and arrested for that.  No, no, I just don't want to be like the guy that is the, the, you know, very noisy guy.  I'm so putting my feet up on the bull next time I'm in there.  I'm going to catch you.  You're going to catch me.  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  All right, we're back though.  We all emptied our bowels.  Yeah.  Very differently today, but we're back.  Back!  Oh, shit.  What do you want to do?  We got Mel Gibson's tape number three. 
[00:51:30]  Yes, I vote for that.  Yeah, I want to hear more Mel.  All right, let's get right.  I vote for Mel.  Yeah.  Well, the second one was the best one yet.  What is that?  What is that?  Wow.  That's a big duty.  Is that a duty?  What is that?  That is a, that is an iPhone video.  Is it you, Danny?  No.  What is that?  It's not me.  It's not Danny.  I'm trying to figure out the angle. 
[00:52:00]  It looks like Keith.  Nope.  Huh?  Is that D-Boy?  It's a, there you go.  That is D-Boy.  That is indeed the genius D-Boy.  Look at this shit.  What is he, a scat dom?  Jesus Christ.  He, he fucking put the camera between his legs and his show, the shit just falling out  of his ass.  Oh, man.  That's a great one.  God damn D-Boy.  All right.  I can tell by his awful shorts.  He loves to shit and fumble. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, who doesn't?  He's a loner tech.  He really is a creep.  Mel Gibson, tape number three.  Has arrived.  Yes.  For your downloading pleasure.  Pleasure.  I'm going to say, not as good as two.  Right.  But there's some good stuff in here.  Is he as boisterous, as loud, as angry?  Well, where did the tape two end?  Wasn't the quality not as good on three?  Like, didn't it sound like it was taped differently?  Yeah, I think she got a little lazy with her taping or something.  I don't know.  How happy do you think his ex-wife is?  Oh, extremely.  Oh, my God.  She's probably sitting there going, now the world knows. 
[00:53:00]  Hell, the world knows he's an ass.  Finally, the world knows that this romantic lead guy is actually a lunatic in his personal  life.  You think his ex-wife had to deal with this?  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Yeah, he doesn't just.  What do you think?  A guy doesn't just turn into this guy.  What do you think?  Yeah.  I mean, you know, his current broad there is a scumbag for taping him and then, you  know, giving it to the world like she did, but what the hell?  She's just now.  It's like, the more of this I hear, I still love Mel, but it's like, I think he did pop 
[00:53:30]  her in the mouth, and I think she probably did talk about it, and nobody was like, eh.  And then she was like, well, fuck this.  I'm not going to just let this asshole do this, and she taped him.  So they're both kind of dicks.  She's horrible to me.  If it wasn't for him, she'd be up on some fucking stage getting dollar bills shoved in her  G-string.  Exactly.  So we owe it to...  What?  I say they get back together.  They're perfect for each other.  Wow.  No.  That's insane.  A chick tapes you like this and humiliates you?  Never.  He'd bring it up for the next 300 years. 
[00:54:00]  You taped me.  You taped me.  Blow me.  Blow me.  Let's get into the Mel Gibson tape.  Number three.  Don't hire you to come there, okay?  You get that message?  Well, I'll pay her myself.  I found her.  She's my dentist's ex-babysitter.  I've been paying her.  That's my money that she gets paid with.  I'm her employer, not you. 
[00:54:30]  You found her.  I'm her employer.  Fine, but if I need to use her, I will use her.  Because I will not pay her if you bring her to your house.  I will fire her, and I will do it fast.  Okay, then I'll pay her.  Because I need her.  She's good.  No.  You're paying her with my money.  It doesn't matter what you give her.  It's my fucking money.  He's just revving up, man.  You know.  He is such an angry man.  He's kind of calm right here, though.  He's under control. 
[00:55:00]  You're Mel fucking Gibson.  Why so angry?  Dude, the idea that this cunt is spending a nickel of his money is driving him bat shit.  You think that's it?  He hates this fucking broad by this point.  But he's got money.  And what is she spending money on?  A babysitter?  Babysitter.  No, I think it was a...  No, no, no.  She was my dentist's housekeeper.  It's a housekeeper.  They're beeping out the name. 
[00:55:30]  They're dropping out the name.  It's his house, obviously.  All right.  So what does he want?  A place to be a pigsty?  I...  He hasn't mentioned one thing.  Like, you bought 20 cars in a fucking mansion and this, that.  Like, I don't see one thing that she's doing that would drive him to get this angry.  I don't see it.  He hates her.  He hates her.  He hates her.  What did she do?  Well, let's hopefully find out here.  All right.  Take number three.  You understand.  You're not...  You don't have your own money.  You're only using my money. 
[00:56:00]  Okay?  You made me moneyless.  I used to have $100,000 a year when you met me.  You took me.  You possessed me.  Everything I am, you owe me with my liver and my kidneys and my thoughts and my soul.  Everything.  My career or whatever it is.  This pathetic career, whatever it is, is yours.  You control me like marionette.  I don't belong to myself, only to you.  I can't do anything and I walk on the eggshells always with you. 
[00:56:30]  That's because you...  Did she write that out ahead of time?  I hate the way they leave words out.  I really...  I walk on the eggshell.  I...  I...  I am like marionette.  It's...  You're like a marionette.  Exactly.  Use all the letters, dummy.  A fucking country where they put backwards R's.  Exactly.  Great toy stores.  Boo!  Yeah.  All of a sudden, Jeffrey the giraffe comes over.  He's like, who's this?  Who's this chipper? 
[00:57:00]  Always with you.  That's because you're a fucking musing whore.  Now.  Okay.  All right.  Well, he explained it to her.  Does he go now?  Did he just say now?  Now.  That's because...  Yeah.  Because she asked a question.  He gave an answer.  Let's go backwards.  Only to you.  I can't do anything and I walk on the eggshells always with you.  That's because you're a fucking musing whore.  Now.  I warn you.  Do not use shit at your house.  I have warned you. 
[00:57:30]  She will be fired if she goes to your house.  You find that cunt.  And you find some other money that's not mine.  Okay?  No.  I'm using a B.  She's fired.  Do you understand that?  Fine.  She's fired.  I won't fire her.  Because I won't pay her.  Okay.  Don't pay her.  And I won't fire her.  That's okay.  Only works at my house.  Well, she does nothing to do at your house.  Baby's here.  Oh.  The baby should be here and she should work at my house. 
[00:58:00]  Baby is where I am.  Oh.  You're insane.  The baby should not be there for long.  I will fire her.  If she is at your house, I will make it known and fire her.  Fine.  I'll report her to the fucking people that take fucking money from the wetbacks.  Okay?  Let's see.  What are we up to with Mel?  Wetbacks.  Wetbacks.  Niggers.  Right.  Jews.  Jews.  Kike.  Did he say kike?  I think he did say kike in the cop car. 
[00:58:30]  Oh.  And then he called the cop sugar tits.  Sugar tits.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's got to be a compliment.  I want to hang out with Mel.  He just cannot control himself.  How do these people get stuck getting recorded like that?  It's hard on the phone.  Can I say this for the record?  Maybe one of us was in the car last night with their girlfriend having a screaming bitch.  Really?  I see how you can get this angry. 
[00:59:00]  Why were you fighting?  Just nonsense.  It's never anything serious.  You guys got a lot of nonsense that you fight over.  It's always nonsense.  What was it about?  I'd rather not say.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Only because it was of a personal nature and not mine.  Was a wetback involved?  Yes.  I caught her fucking a wetback on my kitchen table when I had specifically asked her to order Chinese food.  And she said, oh, I thought you said fucking immigrant.  I'm like, you're always misunderstanding me.  That's a big misunderstanding. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Standing.  Standing.  All right.  But it was a stupid thing.  Yeah.  It always is, dude.  It's like these fights that get this.  And it wasn't like this.  Yeah.  Where we all of a sudden yelling.  It's like when you're not, when you feel like you're not being heard.  It's fucking frustrating.  Uh, frustrating.  What?  I wasn't listening.  You know.  What?  I was.  What? 
[01:00:00]  What?  What the fuck is that?  I was doing a, I'll tell you what started it.  I was doing a, an interview yesterday for Esquire Magazine.  Uh, they were, they called me about happy.  Esquire?  Yeah.  Hop is bizarre.  Ooh.  They wanted to know because I wrote happy endings.  So they'd emailed me and said, look, the reporter said, I'd like to talk to you about, she's doing something on massages.  And she asked me about how many massages have you gotten? 
[01:00:30]  And blah, blah, blah.  What are some of the, the keywords when you're going to try to get?  Oh, so it's over the Al Gore thing, obviously.  I'm assuming it is.  Yeah.  They're a big, uh.  You're probably right.  Expose.  Expose.  And I, I even told her I've used that language.  That's why I believe in masseuse.  So when we were talking about it, she asked me to estimate how many massages I've had, how many were legit, how many real masseuses did I ever get to jerk me off?  Not in that language.  So whatever, I told her.  I'm talking to my girlfriend about, I'm like, yeah, because she knows my history.  She's, she doesn't care.  But I told her, I'm like, yeah, I told her what the estimate of legitimate massages I've gotten where I've gotten handjobs. 
[01:01:00]  Um, and she's like, wait a minute, that's not what you told me.  That many times, girls?  I'm like, yeah, but I did tell you that.  And she's like, no, you didn't.  Because she knows I still get massages, but she knows I get them with dot.  And she knows the people I'm getting them from, honestly, are 100% legit.  So whatever.  It was like in this whole, and I knew how to explain it to her different, but I was so angry that she had questioned me.  And I'm like, but that's, and I'm like, no, no, no, maybe I just estimated it wrong. 
[01:01:30]  And she's like, well, you have to say that now.  So it was like started that shit.  Oh boy.  It's like, but you're saying I'm lying, and I really wasn't.  And it was like that dumb moment, fucking eight blocks later, we were just yelling at each  other.  Screaming.  Yeah, but it's like, that's how that shit starts.  We're one person where I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm like, maybe I did estimate incorrectly.  But, and she thinks I'm lying.  It's like that fucking moment.  I was like.  Did you bring other shit into the argument?  It's, it's like we both carry a, we carry bags of other shit.  Right.  Simply to pull out. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  Of course.  Like, what good is fighting with other shit?  Shit just comes flying out of the closet.  How did we get here?  Exactly.  Yes.  All right.  Back to the Mo Gibson tape.  Fire her.  Fine.  I'll report her to the fucking people that take fucking money from the wet bags, okay?  Mel, you can't just take a woman who gives you a child, who gives you the entire life.  You drag her through, God knows what, bad press.  I've never had a bad word said about me in my entire life.  I can't.  And then, and then you're telling me. 
[01:02:30]  Does he say, hey, cunt?  Hey, cunt.  I didn't.  Oh, I love him.  He is a pisser.  Hey, cunt.  He's like, let me interject here.  Hey, hey, cunt.  Hey, cunt.  He's pacing.  He probably has white shit in front of his mouth.  Oh, is he angry?  She premeditated this whole thing.  Oh, sure.  She's got, like, bullet points and all sorts of stuff on paper in front of her.  You can tell.  She knows what buttons to press.  It almost sounds like she has a writer for this. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  How to make him sound like a stark raving madman, which, I mean, I'm sure he does a great job  by himself.  Yeah.  But she knows he's being recorded.  She's the one doing it.  So, of course, she wants him to sound crazy.  Who gives you the entire life.  You drag her through, God knows what, bad press.  I've never had a bad word said about me in her entire life.  And then, and then you're telling me, and then you're telling me that you take away whatever  you have pennies that you've just given to me?  I don't have anything because I've given you my life three years now. 
[01:03:30]  I gave you everything.  Don't you dare fucking complain to me.  I'll fucking hear you.  You don't fucking count.  You're a fucking using whore.  What did I use you for?  I've given you everything I had.  Fucking thing.  I've given you everything.  I've been your woman.  I've given your child.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Bitch, that's all.  You would have done it for any fucking shit.  You probably fucked shit.  Wow. 
[01:04:00]  I know you did.  That's fucking yes.  I swear in front of God, I never have.  Fucking ugly man.  You don't give a fuck so long as they pay your fucking rent.  I am not the whore, and I'm not the bitch, and I'm not the cunt, and I'm not the user,  and I'm not the thief.  Wait, did he say are so?  Are so.  Did he say that in the back when she said, I'm not a whore?  I could be wrong, but did he yell are so?  Are so.  Fucking wreck.  I am not the whore.  And I'm not the bitch, and I'm not the cunt, and I'm not the user. 
[01:04:30]  This Mel Gibson's great.  Come on, this is a gag, right?  It's just so unbelievable.  This is a fucking gag.  Is he drunk, Jimmy, you think?  I don't know, dude.  It's like, I don't know what time of day the phone calls.  It doesn't sound like he's drunk.  To me, he sounds like a, he also sounds like a rageaholic.  Like, he's one of those guys who, anger feeds itself, like, and I am very guilty of it.  It's like, you get that, it's a high.  It becomes a high.  Wow, really?  And I say horrendous things when I'm mad. 
[01:05:00]  Like, I really, but it's like, when I'm fighting, I don't feel like a lot of times I'm hurting the person.  Like, I really feel like it's a movie that I'm in.  And I come down, and a lot of times I feel very guilty about the things I've said, like, but they don't, they're not connected to me.  So I could see how a guy could say this stuff and literally be disconnected from it.  And I'm not saying, you know, saying it's right, but I can absolutely see how you could be horrible and feel disconnected from it. 
[01:05:30]  Hmm, wow.  I don't, I, I, I know going through my divorce, I felt anger exactly like this, exactly like this.  But I wasn't able to get on a phone and blurt it out like this, or even get in person and get in someone's, someone's face in her face or anyone's face and start yelling like this.  You know, so I would, the most I would do is as I'm driving, just scream at the top of my lungs at my windshield as I'm driving home from the court. 
[01:06:00]  But, uh, but to actually be on the phone or face to face with someone like this, I, I, that kind of anger is, is like.  There's a lot of people out there that could relate to this.  Jesus, it's crazy.  You could absolutely relate to this.  Yeah, I would 100%.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  I, I, I don't know what this is about, though.  I don't know what was the incident that, that got Mel so enraged.  He won't come clean, he says she's a user. 
[01:06:30]  All right, but she did something that set him off.  What was that?  I don't think it's one thing.  You fucked that ugly man.  I don't think it's one thing.  I think it's one of those things in a relationship where everything, it gets jumbled on top of each other.  Yeah, but no, but then you fucked, but that time, and you had those guys.  It's, it's, it's.  He didn't say the tits.  He didn't like her fake tits.  He didn't like the way she said that.  It's like a whore.  Maybe she said, I, are they even married?  I don't even know.  Maybe she said, you know, she's leaving him.  Something happened.  Yeah.  That got this ball rolling is what I'm saying.  He's just pissed at every penny she's spending. 
[01:07:00]  Even if he's got a billion dollars, he doesn't want her spending 10 bucks.  Because he hates her.  Because he fucking hates her.  Yeah, he has the money.  He could care less about the actual money.  And he's tied into this bitch forever.  Ew.  Ew.  I have fucked girls before.  This is a relationship, so it's different.  But even relationships where it's like, thank God I did not knock that pig up. 
[01:07:30]  Please, please, please, thank God I am not tied into that piece of shit with a kid.  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  And I'm sure Mel has had them too, but this one he's tied into forever.  I am not the whore, and I'm not the bitch, and I'm not the cunt, and I'm not the user,  and I'm not the thief, and all those words, and I'm not a liar.  All these lies, all these lies, I'm not a whore, or cunt, or thief, or prostitute, or anything that you call me. 
[01:08:00]  I'm not a user, not a gold digger.  I don't have any money and no property assigned to me.  That's a gold digger for you?  Are you insane?  Yes, you are, of course.  We can hear that, because you're screaming.  Don't call me bitch.  Don't call me.  You have no right.  I don't have a penny to me.  What kind of gold-digging whore is this? 
[01:08:30]  Mel, Mel, the equipment is instead of payment.  If you hire any composer, you'll have to pay 200,000 plus.  Okay, what's going on?  Now at least we're getting some headway here.  What's going on?  She has this music career that Mel apparently doesn't really think is very good.  I think he said it in a past tape that she's about a piece of shit. 
[01:09:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What'd you say?  I think Mel doesn't like her music career.  Is this her?  Oh, yeah, it is.  This is Say My Name.  Say My Name?  Cunt.  Or so.  Okay, first note is bad.  Wow, the first note.  That's no Mariah Carey right there.  And Mel is footing the bill for composers and instruments and everything. 
[01:09:30]  So that's what he's pissed at.  But I think this, I'll say this.  I remember when we were looking at her ass and she was a Russian singer or something when he first met her.  Mel is a fucking guy who probably said to her, look, I'll bankroll your career.  Yeah.  Because he's Mel Gibson.  Like, this is a couple hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money.  But to Mel Gibson, to bankroll, it's probably a write-off.  No.  He's getting that Braveheart money still.  Are you kidding?  I'm calling my name. 
[01:10:00]  Cunt!  Wow, is she that terrible.  You're a dishonest cunt!  I see.  I see remix.  I think D-Boy.  D-Boy should take this and do something with it.  I think this next song should drop like one of his long, tapered logs.  Yeah.  My name. 
[01:10:30]  Brother, I am calling my name.  You're a dishonest cunt!  When I was half away, the birds and the leaves have joined October Grey with cold days of coming.  She's horrible. 
[01:11:00]  She is really bad.  And she's got, like, real people behind her.  Oh, and Mel just looks at his fucking statements and sees, like, $12,000.  Because she started talking, like, well, that's for an arranger.  Right.  Like, she's fucking paying for guys to write arrangements.  Who does she sound like?  She sounds like a tranny, I think.  She sounds like fucking Yoko.  A little Michael Jackson in there.  Really?  Manly, like, you know what I mean?  The music is not bad itself, but the...  Well, she's paid a lot of money for that. 
[01:11:30]  I think she's trying to be Bajorque.  My name again.  My name again.  Her name should be Mariah can't carry a note.  A little airy, that voice.  Shitney Houston.  I've died to what there was. 
[01:12:00]  You wish you will die.  $12,000 for a tootally-doo player, you cunt.  You fucking cunt.  I'm just telling you, they look stupid.  Let's see if I do a fuck. 
[01:12:30]  Arso.  It's my new favorite moment.  That's great.  I am not a whore.  Arso!  Arso!  Arso!  Do two!  That's how mad he is.  He's Mel Gibson.  Is that the end of the tape?  No, we got more.  Oh, okay.  We're done with the dumb song, though.  No, no.  No, no.  You think she's good?  Ooh.  She stinks.  Stinks!  Wow.  That pussy must be great.  Oh, that Russian pussy.  What the fuck did Mel Gibson get something to? 
[01:13:00]  She fucking...  She milked that fucking Australian seed.  Is that yours, Danny?  Lady caca.  Lady caca.  That's...  Oh, Lady caca.  That is...  Oh, she's terrible.  Back to the tape.  Rosie, you'll have to pay 200,000 plus.  I don't have to.  I can do it for nothing.  I don't need you, and I don't want you doing it.  I don't think you can do it.  All right?  That's how little I think of your fucking talent.  Yeah, well, it's clear now. 
[01:13:30]  He's right on that one.  He is right on that.  That was horrible.  I don't think you're going to do it.  That's how little I think of your...  He's so...  You know what?  Yeah.  He sounds like...  Listen to his cadence.  He sounds like fucking Jack Torrance.  He sounds like Nicholson.  Oh, wow.  When do you think maybe we should take Danny to a doctor?  To a doctor.  That's how little I think of your talent.  Maybe as soon as possible?  I get out of the tub, I kiss you.  You had sores on your back. 
[01:14:00]  Well, let's give her a chance.  There's a second song.  I have to pay for new Danny t-shirt and sweatshirt was ripped.  Yeah, Apollo sweatshirt.  Sweatshirt was ripped.  I'm not paying for it.  I hope you get raped by a gang of nigger cooks.  And don't you dare have Lloyd come over and mix you drinks because I'm not paying him.  You whore.  You fucked Lloyd, didn't you?  You whore. 
[01:14:30]  Right on.  We have a second song, Byer.  A second song?  The beast side.  Let's listen to this one, too.  Maybe we picked the wrong song.  This one might be better.  Beautiful Heartache.  Beautiful.  What's she walking?  This is scary.  It's like church music.  Horror movie.  I want to be pushing my ass up to a... 
[01:15:00]  Like, I want to get my glutes rubbed to this.  This is where the fingers brush your asshole, quote-unquote, accidentally.  Oops.  I think it's more of a horror movie than a massage music.  Mel's just seeing money go down a drain.  When he hears this, he just pitches cash going out the window.  Yeah.  Well, this is lethal weapon, residuals.  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  It's a hell of an arrangement for a shitty voice.  What the fuck would you do with this?  It's your turn up at the pole.  If I had no storms, I wouldn't rave.  No addictions, I wouldn't grave. 
[01:16:00]  Kurt loves calling him beautiful earache.  Wow.  Sounds like the fucking soundtrack for a Tarantino movie.  Yeah.  Like a chill bill soundtrack.  Yeah.  If I would do anything.  All right, enough.  Yee.  That sucks.  That is some bad shit.  Let's get back to the tape.  I think Anthony was playing that in the bathroom before.  Piddle, piddle.  Bloop.  Bloop.  Bloop.  That's what her voice sounds like.  That sounds like fucking a fiery salsa shit. 
[01:16:30]  Hey, salmonella shit voice.  That's what her voice sounds like.  A salmonella dump.  A fucking wet salmonella shit.  She is an atrocity.  Where the fuck could you play that?  She stinks on ice.  Back to the tape.  You're fucking talent.  Yeah, well, it's clear now.  It's all coming out now.  It's all fucking true.  Yeah.  Fuck you, you're a fucking horse.  I think you just, all you want to do is just shove me in a hole and sit me at home. 
[01:17:00]  So much for your promise, I want to let you fly.  This is such bullshit.  It's such arrogant bullshit.  You never meant to do that.  Fly now, cunt.  What did he say?  I'm letting you fly now, cunt.  Oh, his comebacks are fucking wonderful.  I just wanted to yell at me.  Exactly.  Oh, Matt A in Iowa.  Bravo.  Jessica Rabbit.  There's a Jessica Rabbit thing going on with her music. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  You know what you could tell?  Good job.  You know what you could tell went on at some point during their relationship?  He was probably lovingly holding her as they were making love.  And he's talking about helping her with her career.  And she's like, you know, I don't know.  I have to take so much work.  And he's like, baby, I just want to let you fly.  Oh, that's so wonderful. 
[01:18:00]  And now, cunt, I'll let you fly now.  No, she probably said like, this was probably one where, here's what was happening.  This is what I think was happening.  Mel, they had fooled around a little bit.  But she was worried about getting in a relationship because she didn't want to be cooped up.  And she's kissing Mel's neck.  And I'll bet you he had, I'm going to guess, like tan khaki pants.  And they were around his ankles.  And I can picture him sitting on the sofa with his ankles together and his knees wide apart.  Like, you know, you sit with pants on and your dick and balls are just way out there. 
[01:18:30]  And he's trying to guide her fucking communist mouth onto his dick.  And she's like, I don't want to be cooped up.  And he's like, no, baby, you'll never be cooped up.  I'll let you fly.  And then she went, I'll let you fly.  As in, pull down my fly.  Yes.  I'm going to let you fly.  And then she sucked his fucking apocalypto-directed cock as she should have.  And she licked his Mad Max balls.  Oh, yes.  Fucking no-talent chick.  Holy shit. 
[01:19:00]  Such arrogant bullshit.  You never meant to do that.  Fly now, cunt.  Fly away.  Fly away.  I'm letting you fly now, cunt.  Fly away.  He's a comic.  The guy's hysterical.  Tape number three started off a little slow, but man, it's...  This guy's great.  It's getting way better now.  Bullshit.  You never meant to do that.  Fly now, cunt.  What?  Fly away. 
[01:19:30]  What?  I gave you every fucking opportunity.  And I've done extremely well.  But nobody asked you to spend so much money on the videos and everything.  Oh.  And why do you count my food out of my mouth?  Why do you do that?  I live with you.  I gave you a baby.  We're together.  And you counting that and summering it all up?  And why do you not separate those two?  If you count the food in my mouth, why don't you separate it?  And how about you giving me money and I'm feeding you and going shopping all the time 
[01:20:00]  and buying you extravagant presents?  What are you talking about, you fucking ignorant bitch?  I don't understand you.  You're saying stupid shit.  How dare you fucking even insult me with some of the stupid reasoning you have?  Your logic sucks because you're a fucking mentally deprived idiot.  When do you think maybe we should take Danny to a doctor?  He's fucking Nicholson and the Shining.  He's crazy.  And whenever you hear me typing, I should be taken to a doctor. 
[01:20:30]  When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?  As soon as possible.  As soon as possible.  That's exactly what he's doing.  Whenever you hear me typing, or whatever the fuck you hear me doing, you ignorant cunt,  it means I'm working and stay away.  Not going to pay for any more instruments.  Not going to pay for pianos or airy produced vocals. 
[01:21:00]  I'm just going to bash your fucking head in.  Bash it right the fuck in.  I love what he goes, Nicholas, I'm going to bash your brains into this hands and go out.  Bash it right the fuck in.  Right the fuck in.  He's almost light hearted about it.  Yeah.  Because you're a fucking mentally deprived idiot.  You can't even fucking figure out.  I have to go to the booth.  I have fucking avocado on me. 
[01:21:30]  If Grady can't get this shit off, you cunt.  I can't go back to the fucking goose soiree.  Per second, per second.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's talk.  Nicholson is sitting down at the typewriter.  I have to look into his awful novel.  Which is the same thing over and over.  What do you want to talk about?  What a terrible book. 
[01:22:00]  What do you want to talk about?  She's got a bat.  Oh, she's scared.  I can't really remember.  You can't remember.  No.  I can't.  This is so much like him.  Damage awful with a sweater.  Danny?  Maybe it was about him. 
[01:22:30]  I think we should discuss.  Yeah.  Let's go ahead.  Let's get the whole fucking.  I know.  Let's watch the whole book.  Yeah, we're starting with the opening credits.  That music is fucking chilling to start off the shot.  Try right here.  Right here.  Yeah.  Very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny.  And I'd like to know what they are.  Well, I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor. 
[01:23:00]  You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?  When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?  As soon as possible.  As soon as possible.  You believe his health might be at stake.  Yes. 
[01:23:30]  You are concerned about him.  Yes.  And are you concerned about me?  Of course I am.  Of course you are.  Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?  Oh, Dick, what are you talking about?  Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities?  Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?  That sounds just like it. 
[01:24:00]  Has it ever occurred to you that I have agreed to look after the Overlook Hotel until May the 1st?  Does it matter to you at all that the owners have placed their complete confidence and trust in me  and that I have signed a letter of agreement, a contract, in which I have accepted that responsibility?  I see.  You have the slightest idea that a moral and ethical principle is.  Do you?  Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future if I were to fail to live up to my responsibilities?  Has it ever occurred to you? 
[01:24:30]  Has it?  Stay away from me.  This would be actually a very valid point if he wasn't trying to kill his wife.  I'm very confused.  I'm very confused.  I just made a chance to think it's over.  Yeah.  You've had your whole fucking life to think things over.  What good's a few minutes more going to do you now?  Stay with me. 
[01:25:00]  Please.  Don't hurt me.  I'm not going to hurt you.  Stay away from me.  Wendy.  Stay away.  Darling, light of my life.  I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  No.  I said, I'm not going to hurt you.  I'm just going to bash your brains in.  I'm going to bash him right the fuck in.  He's so happy with himself.  Don't hurt me.  He's going to bash him right the fuck in. 
[01:25:30]  Don't hurt me.  Don't hurt me.  Don't hurt me.  That's about it.  Yeah.  And he smacks him in the head.  And then he goes, give me the bat, Wendy.  Like, why would she give you the bat?  That is so fucking Mel Gibson.  That speech.  The whole walking up the stairs thing.  The cadence is great.  Here's the end of the tape.  20 seconds left.  Fucking figure out.  I have to go to the baby.  I have to go to the tax money instead of the credit card.  Don't you get it?  Goodbye, Mel.  Baby's crying.  I have to go. 
[01:26:00]  Go look after my child.  She's my child, too.  Yeah, I know.  Unfortunately, you conch whore.  I hope she doesn't turn out like you.  He just had to hang up on her.  And that concludes tape number three.  Fantastic.  I'm sure there'll be tape number four today.  Fan-fucking-tastic.  What a fucking classic he is.  I hope she has volumes of these.  All you have to do is put the shining music behind this.  That's all.  It's easy.  And then have her just with her little... 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, throw a little of that in.  Yeah, throw a little of that in there.  It's fucking perfect.  Well, why don't we play our second Mel Gibson remix?  Game on, by the way.  We're looking forward to other remixes coming in in the coming days.  Take the audio and do something with it.  Like D-Boy did.  He took Mel Gibson and a little Terry Schiavo and came up with this.  Stay on this phone and don't hang out for me.  I can.  I have plenty of energy to drive over there. 
[01:27:00]  Do you understand me?  You need a fucking bat on the side of the head.  All right, how about that?  You need a fucking doctor.  You need a fucking brain transplant.  You need a fucking...  You need a fucking soul.  What the...  What?  All right.  I'm trying to death.  No, you're all angry now. 
[01:27:30]  I'm threatening.  I'll put you in a fucking rose garden, you cunt.  You understand that?  Because I'm capable of it.  You understand that, bitch?  This is the Open Entry Show.  The Open Entry Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM. 
[01:28:00]  Kelly from Philly held through the break.  Just really fast, because we just did the Mel Gibson tapes.  Tape number three.  I'm sure there's going to be a tape number four in the next day or so.  What do you got, Kelly?  Oh, I was just...  When I was listening to these last night with my husband, I turned to him and I said,  this is one of our conversations.  We talk exactly...  Well, he talks exactly the same way.  But only when somebody's listening am I talking like her. 
[01:28:30]  Otherwise, I'm going, you fucking dickhead.  You douchebag.  You're such a loser.  You know, it's not as calm as she's acting.  Yeah, that's why I said this is premeditated.  It's obviously premeditated on her part.  Because you're right.  She would be yelling and screaming back.  She wouldn't be taking...  She's way too calm.  Yeah, way too calm.  She wouldn't be taking half that shit.  Yeah, she's trying to make him sound like the lunatic and her sound like the sane person.  Yeah, she knew exactly what she was doing.  She wound him up.  And she had bullet points and everything.  You could tell.  She has stuff in front of her that she wants to get out. 
[01:29:00]  It's all written down.  It sounds at times that she's reading a statement or something.  No, I completely agree.  Because I've done the exact same thing.  If he called me when somebody else was listening, I'd be saying the same thing.  It's being condescending and getting him to just flip out of me further.  And, you know, if she gets so much money for this, then I guess maybe I should sue too.  Right on.  All right, Kelly.  Good job.  All right.  Talk to you later.  All right.  Good observation.  Yes.  Do you want to move on or do you want to talk to Eddie in St. Louis?  What does Eddie have? 
[01:29:30]  You know Eddie, the sports guy.  Eddie.  Eddie, you've got to make it fast because we're going to move on to catching the criminal,  the Q104 criminal.  What do you got, Eddie?  I really don't have any sports stuff to talk about.  I just thought the Mel Gibson tapes were very entertaining, but he's not exactly relevant  anymore, so it just doesn't seem like he's a big deal.  What do you mean?  This is like some of the best audio shit I've ever heard.  Even if it was some plumber from fucking Staten Island, this would be great to listen to.  It's just an angry guy yelling at his bitch. 
[01:30:00]  Second of all, Mel Gibson had a hell of a career.  Yeah.  And he put out that, what is it called again?  Apocalypto.  Right.  That was only a couple years back, so he's still relevant, Eddie.  Right.  Absolutely.  No, I mean, I just, you know, I kind of just consider him mentally deranged, so it really  doesn't surprise me.  And then he fucking put out that goddamn Jesus movie, too.  That's right.  The passion of the Christ.  Yep.  Which, now you kind of get where his mindset was.  There was a line... 
[01:30:30]  With Jesus taking that abuse.  No kidding.  Wow.  There was a line that they took out of that, too, because Jews were pissed off about it.  What was it?  I don't know.  Somebody may know, but there was something about where he was blaming Jews.  Yeah, and they were being portrayed as like the...  One of the Sanhedrin said, his blood is on our hands.  That's what he took out of the movie.  Okay.  Wow, Eddie.  Jesus.  He's just a fucking major league Jew hater.  I mean, you know, growing up with that old man, it's not really a shock.  I mean, you heard about his next picture, right?  No.  Auschwitz the musical.  No.  What's his next movie?  Call me!  The phone cut out, dude. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, I said Auschwitz.  Oh, we heard you!  You did not fall for that.  You got me.  Eddie, are you a broadcaster?  No, man.  I wish I was, but I'm a grad student right now.  Yeah, you do all right.  What do you got on George Steinbrenner?  I see you wanted to say something about that, too.  Well, honestly, I mean, the one thing that always pisses me off is, you know, somebody  who lives in a National League town.  I grew up a Yankee fan.  I'm from New York.  Just the way people act, like everything's so slanted in favor of the Yankees.  I just got done reading a fantastic book, The Yankee Years, about Joe Torre and this other 
[01:31:30]  guy wrote it.  And, you know, it just seems like all that money they spent, you know, if they were really  truly running baseball, he would have had more than seven rings in, what, almost 40 years?  Yeah, that's a very good point.  And the other thing that pisses me off, just real quick, is this whole revenue sharing  thing, because it so disproportionately fucks the Yankees.  And you have teams like Pittsburgh Pirates, they have like a $35 million payroll.  They fuck their fans.  They're the most profitable people in baseball, and they just don't want to compete. 
[01:32:00]  So I think, you know, if they want to make the game, you know, have more parity, don't  put a cap, put a floor.  You've got to spend X amount of money.  Otherwise, you're never going to get competitive baseball.  All right, now we're getting a little too deep, Eddie.  That's sports talk radio stuff right there.  We try to keep it basic here.  Eddie?  Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.  Okay.  I thought he hit the floor.  Right.  Jesus Christ.  All right, Eddie, thank you.  Thank you.  There's Eddie from St. Louis. 
[01:32:30]  I like that.  Eddie.  All right, we got to, what, catch the Q104 criminal?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is something now that's very unique.  I don't know much about it, but Sam came in with this, and it sounds like a really unique  radio promotion.  Now, I'm not one for regular terrestrial radio.  I think everything that is going to be done has been done, whatever, and they tend to rehash  things over and over again.  This just sounds like a great original idea. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  What, uh, what's the gist of this?  So you're saying this hasn't been done before?  I haven't heard it.  All right.  Somebody on Twitter tipped me off to this, that in Cleveland, on Q104, uh, the plan was  to give away tickets to see Lady Gaga, but as a testament to how popular she is, somebody  stole the tickets.  Oh my God!  No way!  Yes!  Before they could give the tickets away, they went to get them.  Wait, wait, wait.  This sounds, this sounds kind of familiar.  Huh?  No. 
[01:33:30]  No?  You're sure?  This has never been done before?  It's called deja vu, Opie.  I'm having a deja vu.  It seems like the exact same thing was happening, but it's just a feeling.  Right.  Yeah.  So, they went to get the tickets to give away that morning, and the prize box is empty.  And when you went, they were gone!  The insurance company buys your brother a new car.  Where was the prize box?  Uh, I believe it was probably in the promotions office. 
[01:34:00]  Oh!  And somebody must have snuck in.  So they don't do a list.  They actually don't have a list that they put your name on.  They actually keep the hard tickets there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  As opposed to will calls.  Right.  Yeah.  In a box.  So what does this mean?  So now they're looking for a feud, a criminal?  A criminal.  A criminal.  Yeah, a criminal.  A Q criminal.  A Q criminal.  Who, uh, luckily for the station and for the listeners, the criminal started calling the  various shows on Q104 to give hints about who they were and where they would be. 
[01:34:30]  I know Ed's trying to do a bit, but come on.  I mean, we can't even fucking...  We did this bit already.  Are you shitting me?  Our old station did this.  Regular radio.  92.3 Fugitive, right?  This is the second, the third, no, this is third.  Third.  Yeah.  Third one.  Some asshole comes up with a really average bit and then the rest of radio just does it  in every single market across the country. 
[01:35:00]  Dude, that's terrible.  This contest ended a matter of days ago.  It's not like I found a two-year-old thing.  Sure.  This just happened.  So.  And the only way to get the tickets, according to the criminal, is for somebody to approach  the criminal and say, hey...  Who's buying?  Boy, are you the Q104 criminal?  They don't even put their own little spin...  Do they go into a room and maybe go, here's the basic idea, let's change it around a little  bit.  They just follow the script, don't they? 
[01:35:30]  Did this station hold a press conference like that other one?  I didn't remember the press conference with the guys that look like salespeople.  With the sales staff and interns.  There was WWE fucking...  There was no mics.  It was obviously just...  Wow.  Recorded at the station.  But, um...  Wow.  But it's a criminal.  It's not like a fugitive.  It's not a fugitive.  It's a criminal.  It's a...  Yeah.  All right, so they...  Oh, okay.  They're doing their own spin.  They did change it then.  Yeah.  The radio is full of fucking thieves. 
[01:36:00]  Hacks.  Hacks.  And by the way...  This isn't even thievery.  This goes deeper.  It's a consultant that comes up with a bit.  Then they copyright it.  And then they kind of sell it to...  They sell it to the station.  ...individual stations across America.  This morning show and this station has indeed been featured on previous Jocktobers.  Jocktober?  Yes.  Wow.  They really are not busting apart any stereotypes.  Wild and Fee.  What? 
[01:36:30]  That's the morning show.  Wake up with Wild and Fee.  What's wild about them?  Well, you see, you'd think, oh, that they were wild.  But it's W-I-L-D-E.  Well, that shows that you're really...  No, that shows that you're really wild.  Right.  Well, you could look at the picture.  Was there a Liz Wild?  Yeah, yeah.  She wasn't that wild.  No.  No, they're probably not as wild as these.  Well, for instance, there's criminals on the loose.  That's a wild thing.  That makes the criminals.  All right, let's get into some audio.  Corey, the nighttime jock, explains the Q104 criminal. 
[01:37:00]  I can't believe Wild and Fee think he did it.  Yeah.  Wild and Fee accused him on their morning show, so...  Oh, how dare they?  The whole station's involved with this fucking dog shit.  Wouldn't you just turn around and go, no, I'm not playing.  How does anybody not have satellite radio?  Yeah.  How do you listen to this fucking garbage?  Commercial radio is fucking garbage. 
[01:37:30]  Shit.  What about Jimmy gets angry?  Dude, it makes me so...  As a creative person, I'm not saying I haven't stepped on ideas,  but these thieving pieces of shit in radio.  Holy fucking shit.  It's all commercials and fucking shit.  Well, let's get into it.  Corey, the nighttime jock.  Q104.  You know, this morning we were going to give away Lady Gaga tickets  with Wild and Fee at 710.  They went to give them away.  The music.  Couldn't find the tickets. 
[01:38:00]  They have been stolen.  Now this person claiming to be the Q criminal has called up  and has been taunting them all day,  but we still have no idea who the Q criminal is.  Wouldn't you just go fuck yourself?  I'm not playing along.  Here's what we got, guys.  And you know what?  Ant and I, we were...  They wanted to drag us into some horseshit fucking promotion  they were doing at NAW.  Guess what?  We said, go fuck yourselves.  And we made fun of the whole thing,  and the whole staff hated us.  We started taking the songs off halfway through 
[01:38:30]  and throwing the discs at the wall.  Yeah, that was fun.  That's before the fans started really recording our show.  I would love to hear that stuff.  Very early on.  I remember we used to play baseball with the CDs  instead of playing them and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  The largest rock and roll library.  Right.  It was huge.  Oh, my God.  And the rest of the staff, because they took it so seriously.  What was it?  The Evolution of the Rock?  The Evolution of the Rock of New York.  And they pretty much played all the music that had been played through... 
[01:39:00]  And we had to play John Mellencamp, Pink Houses or something.  We're not fucking playing this.  We finally completely lost it on If You Think I'm Sexy, Rod Stewart.  Yeah.  If you want my body, and you think I'm sexy.  Tippi Tomsbury was great.  Rest in peace.  But, yeah, sorry.  R.A.P.  Yeah, and that one came out and got smashed against the wall,  and then we decided, why would we even play any of this?  Smashed them all.  Then the boss came in. 
[01:39:30]  What are you doing?  We're like, we're not doing this.  It was a whole thing.  We just looked and said, you know what?  I think we're a talk show now.  Yeah, we decided.  I think we're just a talk show.  You know what?  We decided.  I'm not sure, but I think we are.  Yeah.  No one told us to start being a talk show.  That day, we said, you know what?  I think we're going to be a talk show for now.  Yeah, we're going to be a talk show.  We were still playing music at that point.  Don't you guys think that sometimes it's important to be a team player, though?  Well, with something like this, to catch a criminal.  That's what I'm saying.  That's the difference.  Yes.  All right, let's bring it back to this.  Cool, cool, cool. 
[01:40:00]  Who the Q criminal is?  We don't know.  You can find clues at Q104.com, but right now, why wouldn't they involve the police?  Why would the fucking criminal be leaving clues at Q104, you fucking cunt?  He's a thief, but he went to our website and got the password and left clues.  I have no dignity.  You wanted to be a radio guy?  Is this what you wanted to do with your life, you fucking asshole?  It's called multi-marketing. 
[01:40:30]  Holy fucking shit.  Multi-marketing is in place here.  How is there not one ounce of dignity on these jocks?  Do they involve Twitter?  Let's say hi to Footer Footer.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I know it's fucking wild.  This is kind of crazy, but why don't they just get two more fucking tickets?  Yeah, Sam.  Well, Lady Gaga is a hot ticket right now.  They're probably all sold out.  How about you cut your losses and you get two more stupid tickets?  And the last thing they want to do is let a criminal get away with a crime. 
[01:41:00]  Well, it is the principle of it, I guess.  I think you're right, Ant.  I mean, right now, it's just very sketchy.  We don't even know who this person is.  Well, you know what?  Rebecca Wilde accused you of stealing them.  She said, because you always complain you don't have no money.  I swear to God.  Wow.  See what happens when you just go, well, Rebecca's a cunt.  Yeah.  She's a cunt.  She's a cunt.  Blow me.  Blow me.  Who is this dumb woman?  How involved is this woman? 
[01:41:30]  Like Rebecca said.  Why don't you mind your fucking business, rat?  Rat.  That's an insider.  Of course.  Yeah, that's like the promotion girl or something.  You don't think it was just a fan of the station who listens to the morning show and the nighttime show?  No, no, Sam, no.  You better go back and get some more radio education from Scorch.  Oh, yeah.  Can I go to Dominic in Jersey?  Dominic.  Dominic.  Hey, guys. 
[01:42:00]  Hey.  I heard Opie talking about the old stuff the other day.  I was listening to a YouTube of Opie arguing with Carol Miller, smashing TV against the wall.  I was laughing my ass off.  All the Carol Miller arguments.  The Carol Miller tapes are just legendary.  They really are.  If someone could give me a link to that YouTube video or Sam or somebody, I'll tweet it today so you can check it out.  Poor woman.  Jesus.  I know we've told this story a million times, but my favorite part of the story, and she works here at SiriusXM.  I haven't bumped into her in many years. 
[01:42:30]  I hear her on Classic Rewind, I think it is, or whatever.  I have no problem with her anymore.  I mean, this is like 10 years ago.  But my favorite part from back then was it got to the point she wasn't allowed to see us in the hallway.  Yeah, yeah.  And that wasn't our doing, by the way.  We never played that horse shit.  It's the program director.  Other radio guys have played that horse shit.  But they made her hang out in the mail room, which was a tiny little fucking closet.  Yeah, where the cubbies were for the mail.  Until we passed by.  She was allowed to see us pass by, meaning we were going back to our office. 
[01:43:00]  Then that was her cue that she was allowed to go into the studio to start her show.  And me and Aunt were such fucking dicks that we would hang out to the last possible second before we passed by the mail room.  Giving her no time to set up for her show.  How awful.  All right, sorry.  I swear to God.  Wow.  See what happens when I sleep through the morning show? 
[01:43:30]  Right.  Okay, I did a little searching and I found the audio.  Listen to what Rebecca said about her.  It's quick.  How did he find it so quickly?  She's there on the phone with you.  I did a little searching and I found the audio.  Oh, yeah.  How?  The computer system.  What's searching?  We're listening to you listen.  Yeah.  To this sinus lady.  Oh, you know what?  It's like Mike Francesa called her show.  Fucking twat.  Chris from the Poconos has the best way to catch the Q104 criminal. 
[01:44:00]  Listen to this.  Chris, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  The best thing that they could do is just go to the concert and find them in the seats.  Yeah, hey, why don't they do that?  Why don't they do that?  Make believe, like, oh, well, all those tickets are gone.  And then they give away two more Lady Gaga tickets.  But then, night of the show, the authorities are at the venue to catch the criminal.  What if the person that stole them, the criminal, sold them?  Because you know how criminals are.  Yeah.  Black market businesses. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, I thought you were just going to stop.  Oh, I know what you thought.  Yeah, okay.  Sorry.  Audio.  Listen to what Rebecca said about me this morning.  I know he's sleeping, which is why I'm going to say this.  Exactly.  But the first person that came to mind was Corey.  You think Corey took the ticket?  Hey, you said it yourself.  He always talks about how broke he is.  He's not going to be paying $400 for two tickets.  I got to tell you, I thought me and Rebecca were homies.  I'm a little hurt.  That's just wrong.  That's what she said. 
[01:45:00]  That's just wrong.  The acting is great.  Because they have to act.  After hearing this audio, I hate to say this, Cleveland, but you don't deserve LeBron James.  That's why he left.  Good luck in Miami, LeBron.  He doesn't laugh because of this show.  Exactly.  He's actually the criminal.  Wouldn't it be funny if he actually sold the tickets and brought them to Miami?  LeBron, you made the right decision.  Of course you did.  Fucking 15 degrees in fucking June in Cleveland. 
[01:45:30]  And fucking nothing but tits fucking jiggling all over fucking Miami.  Gee, why would he leave?  Why would he go to Miami to be on the beach instead of in Cleveland by the fucking mall with the thugs outside of it?  You can't even go in the mall.  Oh, LeBron will have the key to the...  He doesn't need the key to the city.  He's LeBron James.  Just give them money and they'll give you whatever you want.  Exactly.  Yeah, why would he want to go to Miami?  All those chicks partying every night, sucking your dick on the boardwalk.  Yeah, crazy. 
[01:46:00]  Crazy.  Are you saying Lake Erie's not the same as South Beach?  Dude, I love Cleveland.  Cleveland has nothing but fat pussies in it.  For real.  I love Cleveland chicks.  For real.  But if you're in Cleveland, you can't wonder why he left to go to Miami.  Yeah.  Compared to Miami?  You gotta know.  Well, I want to listen to this guy's voice.  Oh, he's terrible.  What do you think, Ams?  Yeah.  Don Nutt.  This guy is starring in Hot Lead and Cold Feet. 
[01:46:30]  This guy's a fucking piece of shit.  These radio guys are a bunch of losers.  Dude, they really are.  You gotta know when to step out, man.  Not Corey.  Just step out of the bit and make a name for yourself.  That's what we did.  They're playing.  When you know it's horse shit, you go with it and say,  this is fucking horse shit.  I know this works.  That's just wrong.  I didn't think people were going to start resulting to mudsling.  Hanging over this.  Resulting.  They're going to have to wake up and listen to their show one of these mornings, huh? 
[01:47:00]  Uh-huh.  But then they might just put me back to sleep, right?  A little back and forth going on there.  Took a shot at me.  I'll take one right back.  You think he called him up later on?  Look, I was just doing a thing, a bit thing about that.  I love your show and you know that.  Nowhere Pals.  Okay.  Yeah.  I love when you do Battle of the Sexes.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry what I said on your show today.  A fantastic portion of the program that you guys do.  Who's a criminal? 
[01:47:30]  By the way.  Is this fake?  He's not sure if it's real and fake.  I'm not even sure.  Jesus.  What a fucking loser.  Wow, this is so bad.  Well, Anthony, very good news.  The criminal's difficult.  Clues begin.  They're real difficult?  Yeah, they're tough to figure out exactly what the criminal is getting at.  They really spent some time on the writing and trying to make the people think.  All right.  Yeah.  Can't wait.  For a master criminal, I am. 
[01:48:00]  It's the same.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Come on.  That sounds exactly like the 92.3 Fugitive.  Wait.  I am the Fugitive.  Sounds like the 202 Fugitive.  Who's that lady's voice?  Who is this criminal?  I don't know.  We don't know, but it's the Q criminal.  It's the same goddamn effect they put on.  Wait.  It might be the same exact person.  Oh, you're thinking maybe they just do.  Yes.  The criminal.  They have the tape.  Yes, because I'm telling you, a company gets together and they go, wow, we have a great 
[01:48:30]  bit, and then they sell it to these radio stations or these radio companies.  I am the Fugitive.  I am the Fugitive.  I am the Fugitive.  I am the Fugitive.  I am the Fugitive.  Yeah.  It sounds like the same lady.  Because they make it easy for you.  Yeah.  Fucking Bobo.  They make it easy for you.  You're the guy who stole the ticket.  I am the Fugitive. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  What was Bobo's version of it?  It was real bad, wasn't it?  There was two.  He did, I am.  Yeah.  And then your version.  And then he interrupted himself and spoke in his normal voice and said, sorry about your  dog.  I hope the listeners appreciate that bit.  That was one of the funniest bits he's ever done.  I was just watching the YouTube video of when he thought he was getting arrested because  there actually was $10,000 missing.  What, do you have a sample of him doing the Fugitive?  All right, let's listen.  Hi, who's this? 
[01:49:30]  I'm sending the person, a person you very know is on the way.  He will be delivering food.  And he will be also handing you stitches for you to eat on his food.  Who is this?  This is driving me nuts.  Who is this?  Tell us who you are.  I will just have to give you a hint of who I am. 
[01:50:00]  I grew up in Woodside.  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  What an asshole.  That was a little sample of when they were doing that over at our old station.  The criminal's difficult clues begin.  For a master criminal, I am quite unassuming.  At the grocery store, I buy cherries for snack time consuming. 
[01:50:30]  I spend lots of time in the urban sprawl.  But if you ask people from the burbs, you might get it all.  So if you go to the supermarket in the suburbs and somebody's buying cherries.  Cherries, yeah.  That's the criminal.  Ask him.  She buys cherries in the supermarket.  Hey.  Hey.  So why don't they just play a Lady Gaga song?  I wish they would.  She's got so many good ones.  Play teeth.  Or I'd say I'd vote for speechless. 
[01:51:00]  Speechless?  I would too.  Not a funny old man.  Yeah, we want the better Bobo clip where he breaks character.  Absolutely.  Going back to how Bobo played this role.  Fugitive.  Can I ask you, what borough of New York do you live in now?  Not where I live in Queens.  What's happening, fugitive?  Yeah, what happened?  Fugitive?  No, nothing.  I actually, the dog had just walked a little bit too cute. 
[01:51:30]  The dog walked a little bit too cute.  What an idiot.  That was...  What an idiot.  If you wrote that, it wouldn't be that funny.  He honestly fucked that up.  Nothing.  The dog went...  It took like a full ten seconds to realize he's out of character.  He's out of character. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  The cunning criminal returns.  How is the weather?  Hot enough for you?  If you go to Arby's for lunch, ask someone in blue.  Brown hair is a bonus.  Don't pass up that tip.  Go to see Gaga.  That would be quite a trip.  So you got to go to Arby's and look for someone in blue with brown hair?  Yes.  And say, you're the criminal!  So they're involving their sponsors? 
[01:52:30]  What do you think?  Arby's is a spy?  I thought it was just, that's where she's going to go.  I hate my sponsors.  You do?  I could see the meeting, though, that they had.  I don't hate them, but we should be separate.  We're going to involve sales.  Sales is involved in this.  So we're going to have the criminal,  and we're going to have different locations that will get us some revenue.  Because revenue is fun.  It's a win for everyone. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, shut the fuck up.  You think they said that at a meeting?  It's a win-win situation here.  It's a win for the company,  and a dismal loss for anybody with ears.  Oh, my God.  It's a win for their pocketbooks.  Wild and Fee get a call from the Q criminal on the morning show.  So now we go back to the morning show.  We're including everybody.  All the key day parts.  Right.  This is actually audio from the Wild and Fee show. 
[01:53:30]  Wow.  I'm only going to break your heart.  That's Tao Cruz.  Uh-oh.  The Q criminal is on the phone again.  How does he know?  Gosh, why hasn't anyone found this person yet?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Oh, my God.  Why hasn't he found this person?  How do they know that he's on the phone?  Did he go through the screener?  Must have gone through that.  Explains it.  And why would the criminal stay on the line so long?  Like, to wait through the song?  Waiting through the song.  And why didn't they stop the song and just, like,  that is pretty important. 
[01:54:00]  If you have to go with a bit because they would probably fire you,  why don't you make it your own and go,  yeah, oh, fuck, and interrupt shit.  Why does it have to follow a format clock?  Well, the thing about it is even...  Well, at 710, we're going to take the phone call from the Q criminal.  The last thing you want to do is upset people.  And let's be honest, it still is about the music.  Follow me!  Can we hear this guy coming back?  I wish it was N-104.  And it could have been the N-criminal. 
[01:54:30]  Listen to this asshole.  Humiliate himself.  I'm only going to break your heart.  That's Tao Cruz.  Uh-oh.  The Q criminal is on the phone again.  Oh, my gosh.  Why hasn't anyone found this person yet?  Oh, he's been doing a show with Marge Simpson.  Fucking cunt.  Shut up. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm a pussy.  That's why I'm in this scene.  Of all the dramatic phone calls.  And George is lying in a pie box.  You're so right.  She's there to balance it out, everyone.  Yeah, all right.  Don't want the guys getting out of control.  And the guy actually goes,  Oh, boy.  The criminal is on the phone again.  Oh, boy.  I don't know how to handle him.  Before I say the criminal is on the phone,  I should backsell the song and tell you if you talk. 
[01:55:30]  Because I have nothing better to say with his voice of mind.  The boy.  A fucking fire should break out in the entrance of this station.  How great would that be?  Like the Happy Land Disco in the Bronx.  Wow, you're not real local.  A lot of it.  Local radio.  Rules, doesn't it?  Yeah.  How about the criminal?  Local clues for everyone.  Oh, boy.  Well, we got these God God tickets here.  Criminal, are you there?  I'm here.  And so are a lot of your listeners. 
[01:56:00]  I'm sorry I'm late.  And I returned to the place of my original first clue.  Just for now.  Yeah, you're in the promotions office.  Sitting with our dickhead station manager,  who's the biggest flop in this business as I am.  Where did you come up with this idea?  Oh, God damn.  I never heard the overnight. 
[01:56:30]  I didn't think anything could be more awful than the overnight guy.  I stand corrected.  Yeah.  This guy is more awful.  This is really bad.  I think that's wild.  Just for nostalgia.  And it was crawling with people.  Really?  All weekend, I was on the road.  Good contribution.  Fucking tits with a head.  Really?  Really?  Really?  Really?  Her fucking awful witch voice. 
[01:57:00]  Really?  Really?  Yes.  Don't throw water on me or I'll melt.  Fucking cunt.  She sounds like Paul Lynde.  Really?  Really?  I'd love to fucking plant azaleas in her twat with my foot.  I'd like to put azalea seeds on my shoe and kick them into her pussy until they grow.  Have some azaleas in your cunt, stupid.  Why azaleas?  No reason.  Okay.  Just because they would take a lot of love and care. 
[01:57:30]  Really?  Really?  Really?  Really?  Really?  LA.  All weekend, I was on the run.  I was in sneakers.  High heels.  I have none.  I play great poker.  Don't wear a hat.  And what else?  If he looked for my dad, he'd be teaching martial arts.  To protect oneself.  Buss.  Time to go to Google. 
[01:58:00]  Better go to the back of FH Riley's and see a carpet shaking.  What does that mean?  People were talking about the two criminal all weekend.  No, they weren't.  Need to make a trip to Q104.com to figure all this out.  Gaga's coming.  We've got to find the tickets.  How embarrassing.  Oh, God.  I'm douche-chilling.  That's amazing.  When he got into the business, I'm sure he wanted to be like the next Howard Stern or  somebody, and instead he's stuck in fucking Cleveland with a hack radio bit. 
[01:58:30]  That's humiliating.  Doing one of the greatest radio bits ever.  No one's talking about it.  Gaga's coming.  We've got to find those tickets.  We've got to find those tickets.  Let me hit the post here.  For a lousy pair of fuckers.  How about you just take the eighth caller and talk about something that's relevant?  But why do they have to talk?  I mean, the voice is, what the fuck is that?  Well, Gaga's coming.  We're going to have to find those tickets.  We're going to have to find those tickets. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, because she's going to notice that two tickets are missing.  Gaga?  Yeah.  Gaga.  Maybe they're taped around her clit.  Magic Rat from Atlanta.  He's got it.  They should do the Q Serial Rapist.  Yeah, take the criminal one step further.  Look, if you want people talking in your market.  Yes!  Fuck the Q 104 criminal. 
[01:59:30]  The Q 104 serial rapist.  Wild and fair.  Yeah, wild and fair, sure.  You got us here.  I was wild and raped last night by the Q Rapist.  Oh, what did they say?  You look like a fucking bitch on the heat.  And if you get raped by a pack of niggers, it'll be your fault.  That's the clue for the day.  Yeah, the Q 104, the Q Rapist.  You can see he's the Q Rapist because he has a fake cast with Q, with the station logo on it. 
[02:00:00]  And he bashes you in the head and rapes you in his brown Volkswagen.  You need help with that couch?  Would ya?  Oh, yeah.  It puts the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  Wait a minute.  Was she a great big fat person?  Let me say hi to Allison in New Jersey. 
[02:00:30]  Allison.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  I came into the middle of this conversation, and I could have sworn you were talking about something that's going on in your own city.  I got an email yesterday stating that Matt Pinfield is in jail, exclamation point.  Apparently suspicious of the sudden appearance of thousands of dollars tied to the RxP Win Matt's Money on air campaign,  authorities detained Matt Pinfield and employed basically that guy from Law and Order. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, Vincent D'Onofrio.  D'Onofrio.  And they're going to question him.  So, uh, there's all sorts of, oh, yeah, there's all sorts of videos.  Oh, God.  I got the chills.  Wouldn't this have, like, made the news or something?  So he's in jail, and what?  We got to get him out of jail?  You got to get him out of jail?  I have no idea.  I couldn't watch the videos.  They're painful.  Look, I'm just about done.  I got to be honest with everybody. 
[02:01:30]  I can't do this anymore.  Wow.  Too dangerous?  I can't be part of this horse shit anymore.  Too many criminals?  This horse shit.  It's embarrassing.  This is why radio guys are never taken seriously, because of fucking assholes like Matt Pinfield  doing hack bits.  It's a private pile.  Is this, what, is this the actual, uh, could you, hold on, Allison, hold on.  Sure.  Could you start over, Danny?  I'm sorry.  I don't ask you something.  He's being questioned.  You are on.  Sorry.  Matt Pinfield and Vincent D'Onofrio. 
[02:02:00]  D'Onofrio.  Dramatic reading.  Matt Pinfield.  Matt Pinfield.  It's good to see you.  I don't know if somebody will be seen here.  What?  What can I have?  He's holding a suit.  What do you get down?  I'm going to ask you something.  You are on my podcast.  Is it exciting to work on the, uh, radio?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I've dreamed about doing that ever since I was a kid, so it's exciting. 
[02:02:30]  But Private Pile's not a real cop or anything.  It's exciting.  No.  It's an actor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you are desensitized.  At times.  Matt Pinfield's bizarre.  I like that.  Do you?  Yeah, I do.  But he's bizarre.  He's acting.  But he's doing the same hacky shit that we're making fun of Cleveland for, Jimmy.  But I like that.  I don't like Cleveland.  Then he shouldn't be fucking doing this then, man.  He doesn't have to do this shit. 
[02:03:00]  If he's talented.  Maybe.  I would do this just to do a scene with Vincent D'Onofrio.  Well, Matt should recreate one famous scene.  I'll give you a hint.  It takes place in a bathroom.  All right.  Let's go back to the Cleveland thing.  He's got an old Private Pile.  Oh, my dude.  Jesus.  Oh, that movie's fucking...  Why aren't you stomping Private Pile's hair dye out?  Holy shit, he's 78.  Fucking asshole.  God, oh my... 
[02:03:30]  Are shoals and soles allowed in the barracks?  How old is this fuck?  Because you're too old.  Because your bones are too brittle.  They're paying for it.  Put in your dentures and eat it.  Social Security's paying for it.  You eat it.  Congratulations.  Retirement home.  You made it. 
[02:04:00]  That's more hack.  More hack shit.  He looks...  He doesn't get a pass, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  He shouldn't be doing this shit.  I am loving how fucking old...  He has a few years under his belt now.  Vincent D'Onofrio looks bad.  Let's go back to the Q104 criminal.  So now we're up to the point where, for some unexplainable reason, the criminal decides to call Wild and Fee again.  Yeah.  Glitter in the Air.  I love that song.  That is pink.  One of my favorites.  All right.  923. 
[02:04:30]  The Q criminal is on the phone with yet another clue.  I guess we're getting close.  Isn't that right, criminal?  I'm back.  Why haven't they found you yet?  I really thought I'd be caught by now.  Maybe I'll just take the tickets and flee town.  Here's something physical.  By the way, that's how poor Cleveland is.  All the markets do this for real money, right?  Yeah.  They're doing it for a lousy pair of fucking tickets.  All right, yeah.  You're doing it for like $10,000 or something like that.  Like, the criminal is threatening to leave town with the tickets. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Even in an imaginary world, who gives a shit?  That could be worth like $350 if they're good tickets.  And flee town.  Here's something physical that could help if I may be so bold.  Today, and today only, a bottle of Sobe.  I will hold.  Gotta run.  Click.  Wow.  Wow.  Interesting. 
[02:05:30]  Leave town and Sobe.  Hmm.  Is that another sponsor?  Another sponsor.  By the way, their Twitter is WQAL.  That would really suck if people started Twittering WQAL right now.  Maybe other people have theories on who the criminal is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe you could give your theories on who the criminal is, how great their bid is.  Yeah.  You know.  Serious tweets only, please. 
[02:06:00]  I don't even want to do the rest of this fucking horseshit bit.  Why?  Two clips to go, Ant.  Dispensable.  Station gets desperate as the clue is simply everywhere that the criminal will be over the weekend.  A nice summer weekend, oh, where will I be?  A concert tonight, Huntington Beach tomorrow, and the tall ships on Sunday, and the tickets  could be free.  So he's pretty much saying where he's going to be. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  That's not even like a riddle or a...  So that wasn't a clue.  It's like, hey.  So for the people that like games...  Yeah.  It doesn't matter anymore.  Like they said, where will I be?  All the people that really sat there and figured out the clues, now you just go and fucking  tap on some asshole's shoulder that's wearing a WQAL t-shirt, I'm sure.  That's it.  Because they get to the point where they've been doing the promotion for two weeks, and  the promotion's running out, so...  Well, here's the end of the bit.  The criminal is found. 
[02:07:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, breaking news on Q104.  Hello.  We have been caught.  You have?  Yes.  Do you want to talk to our winner?  Yes, we definitely want to talk to the winner.  Okay.  Hi.  Hey, who's this?  Jim Weaver.  Jim.  Now, are you willing to tell everybody where you found this Q criminal?  Where are you guys at right now?  Are you willing?  No.  It may be evidence.  And you hear how excited Jim Weaver is?  He won the contest.  Why aren't the police there?  He won the contest and he can't even get the excitement up.  Why aren't the police there to arrest this gentleman? 
[02:07:30]  I guess Jim Weaver was a better investigator.  In this house.  Are you willing to tell everybody where you found this Q criminal?  Where are you guys at right now?  Oh, we're at Crocker Park at the chess set right here in front of the key private bank.  Oh, the chess set.  Another game is played out in black and white.  Royalty is the match if you get this right.  That was the last clue.  Yes.  Now, are you a person that's been following along this whole time?  Actually, I have to give credit to my wife.  She's the one that figured it out.  Nice job.  And what's her name?  Lori.  Are you excited?  Are you both going to go?  Lacey. 
[02:08:00]  Andrea.  What happened?  Well, she was making a mess in the tub.  And she went, one, two, three, four, five.  I thought she was doing a Tootsie Roll commercial.  She was just drowning her all the spring.  Oh, shit.  Nice job.  And what's her name?  Lori.  Are you excited?  Are you both going to go together to Lady Gaga? 
[02:08:30]  Actually, I'm a hero to my wife and my daughter.  She was a huge Lady Gaga fan.  This is the best husband slash daddy duty maybe ever.  So you got to Crocker Park and what did you see?  You know, they were really good.  It looked like a family just hanging out.  And I thought, this lady's going to pepper spray me.  Did that really merit that type of laughter?  No.  What would have been funny if he said, you know, I thought it was her, so I accidentally started  raping the wrong woman.  That would deserve the big laugh. 
[02:09:00]  If he did get pepper sprayed.  Smashes her in the teeth.  Yeah.  Like, I thought she was the Q criminal, so I started raping a jogger with a stick.  I had a bicycle pump and I was, I was, I raped a jogger's ass in the park.  Turned out it wasn't her.  So I ruined her life for nothing.  That would deserve a big guff-off.  Yes.  That would get a laugh.  Oh, the CD.  Yeah.  That did not deserve the laugh. 
[02:09:30]  No.  At all.  Pepper spray.  Business we're in sucks.  It really does.  Not satellite radio.  We got our new iPhone app updated.  Well, that's good.  Hey, that is true.  It's updated.  I would love to have an account, though.  I got one.  Me too.  I don't.  You should get one.  Do you know I pay for five fucking accounts?  Oh.  Well, that's dumb.  I pay for five serious XM accounts.  Is it?  Yes, I don't pay for shit.  How about I would have not had satellite radio if I didn't pay? 
[02:10:00]  You've had your whole fucking life to get free accounts.  What good is one more free one going to do you now?  You want me to try to find you a login today?  Yeah, tell the fucking guys down the hall.  Tell them give me a motherfucking account for this, and then any account with my name on it.  Wipe it clean!  That one they could do.  That's just silly, Ann.  I want the app.  Now I can multitask.  We'll get you a login.  Again, I was Twittering and listening to SiriusXM same time on my phone. 
[02:10:30]  How excited are the guys down the hall that they have something to do today for the channel?  They're so excited.  Oh, condescending.  Get me free accounts.  That's condescending when you say it like that.  Get me my free account.  They're very excited.  They just sprung up like, holy shit, I get to do something today for the channel.  That's the case I got, Jimmy.  What?  You got that iPad case?  Is that the InCase?  Yes, the InCase.  Yes, I do have that one.  It's big.  It's a big case.  It smells leathery.  Why do you need the InCase?  It's good.  So you can stand it up. 
[02:11:00]  You can stand it up, and it's heavily padded.  I really do like my stupid iPad.  I haven't used mine much.  I use it.  It's laying around all the time.  You can just grab it.  Take it in the shitter with you.  It's just fucking boo-boo.  You're playing games.  You're shitting.  It's a shit.  Hey, remember the song by Mel's woman there?  That hunk of shit?  Well, and remember we said, D-Boy, could you take the song?  And pump it up a little bit?  Of course. 
[02:11:30]  It had to be listening earlier when we played Mel Gibson's tape number three.  Yeah.  Well, here's the song with a few things added to it.  Thanks to D-Boy.  Stay on this phone and don't hang out for me.  Again, I have plenty of energy to drive over there.  Do you understand me?  And I will.  So just fucking listen to me.  Listen to my fucking ranting.  Calling my name. 
[02:12:00]  You could go through money like a fucking war.  And I was half away.  You want the fucking dress.  You want the tickets.  You want the fucking equipment.  I've joined October 3rd.  I can do it for nothing.  I don't need you.  And I don't want you doing it.  I don't think you can do it.  Through this full reign, I'll have to walk a few more miles before you say my name.  No!  Fucking embarrassment to me. 
[02:12:30]  Good bitch!  Go for your gun!  Whore!  Get it?  You would make me want to smoke.  You fucked my damn.  You care about yourself.  You make my life so fucking difficult.  No!  Define that! 
[02:13:00]  You don't care.  You don't care.  You won't even fucking cry.  You get it now?  What mean is?  You have no fucking soul.  Get it?  I'll have to for a little while.  You need a fucking soul.  You need a fucking soul.  I don't like it.  I like how I'm fat.  Just a just fucking smile and follow me. 
[02:13:30]  Because I deserve it.  That was a nice duet.  That was a juxtaposition, I think.  They've done a duet together before this whole thing ended.  Is that called a juxtaposition?  A little bit.  Oh, yeah.  A little bit of a juxtaposition.  All right.  God damn.  I love that Mel Gibson, though.  Love it.  We do have another remix that came in.  Maybe we'll play after the break.  Some people say it needs a setup.  I don't think so.  What?  Because it's Mel Gibson with the double rainbow. 
[02:14:00]  The double rainbow guy.  Oh, him.  But a lot of people haven't seen the double rainbow video yet.  Well, as I was saying, like Joe Rogan during his podcast last night was saying he hadn't  seen it or heard it.  Joe hasn't?  Yeah.  He's all over the internet.  And then his buddy on the show said, oh, everyone's seen it.  And then Joe, in his inimitable logic, goes, look how many hits it has.  And look how many people have the internet.  It's like, I had something like even three million hits. 
[02:14:30]  And it's like, and look, think how many people have the internet.  That means how many people haven't seen it.  And you have to think like, yep, that makes sense.  And it's Rogan.  So if you disagree with him, he can clobber you.  Fucking manhand.  Push you in the face like a real man does.  He, um, you came up in a conversation last night too.  With Joe?  Yeah.  What did I do now?  It was, um, they were doing a quick thing on when you call people, they don't like when  the guy you're calling, when their chick answers the phone. 
[02:15:00]  And he said, once he called you and he goes, yeah, I hope his chick answered the phone.  I was like, you know, I didn't know what to say.  Or, you know, it's like, it's like a weird thing when the guy's chick answers the phone.  And the guys were like, they didn't like that.  They didn't like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They, they're like, you know, did she answering his cell phone?  Cause then guys think that's kind of inappropriate.  I honestly don't even remember that this went on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who's talking about it?  He does a good, he does a really good podcast. 
[02:15:30]  He absolutely does.  That's funny as shit, that guy.  Well, we'll play Double Rainbow.  Double Rainbow.  And then we'll do the Mel Gibson remix with Double Rainbow.  Yes.  Also, uh, the, uh, the broads on TV there, the newsreaders.  What are they doing?  Had a nice conversation about Lindsay Lohan and how she has what?  Uh, lesbian gangs.  Lesbo gangs?  Lesbo gangs want to have prison sex with her.  Yes, yes, yes.  She's going to be in a little jail with, with no one around her, just like cleaning things. 
[02:16:00]  They're going to make it like, uh, maybe clean the pots and pans.  Well, the broads made some good points.  They really did.  Yeah.  We'll explain after the break.  What else is going on?  Oh, it's a quickie.  Uh, Lindsay Lohan is scared.  There's lesbian gangs that want at her when she goes to jail for what?  A weekend?  Uh, yeah. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, I think she's supposed to do 90 days, I think.  Yeah, but it's one of those Paris Hilton deals.  She'll be out in no time.  She's just got to cry.  I can't take it.  It's cold.  I don't know.  And it's the best thing that could happen to her for her career.  She'll get out of jail and she'll make millions off the fact she went to jail.  So what kind of lesson are they teaching her?  Who's going to get that, that first prison?  All that shit.  All that horse shit.  But the women on Fox 5 here in New York, they had to discuss the Lindsay Lohan thing because  it's a serious thing. 
[02:17:00]  Did they?  A lesbo gang wants that, uh, Lindsay Lohan.  And where did they, what did the lesbo gang announce this?  Oh, yeah, they're talking.  Is that what they do?  Word on the street?  Word on the cell block?  Why can't the news just go, well, this obviously wouldn't happen because she's going to be well  protected.  No, because they'd rather, uh, toy with it.  Uh, which, you know, that's fine to do if you're a dopey show like we do, but you're  supposed to be the news.  Heh.  Uh-huh.  Well, uh, here's a few broads talking about it. 
[02:17:30]  This is basically how broads sound when guys aren't around.  Yeah.  All right.  This is the horse shit they talk about.  Let's listen to some of their-  While they're getting their nails done.  While they're horse-  While they're getting their manis and pedis.  This is right.  Lindsay Lohan.  Drama queen.  Drama queen.  And she'd be quite frightened, yeah.  Because of-  Why should be, she should, why should she be quite frightened?  She's going to prison in the lesbo gangs.  Yep. 
[02:18:00]  No idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because according to the Sun newspaper, inmates at the jail where Lohan will be held  want a piece of her.  One woman currently doing time says it will make them famous if they hurt the star.  Now, Lohan will move into the correctional facility New Week.  It will be a far cry from her regular digs.  Inmates say the cells are filthy and cold, and you only get one blanket.  Aw, just one blanket.  Well, some reports coming out of Hollywood, these are on sort of the entertainment blogs, 
[02:18:30]  are saying that she is refusing to go to jail.  She says she's not going to go, she's not going to show up.  As though she really has a choice.  She thinks it's like a manicure appointment.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Well, it's not her last manicure.  I don't have to go today.  Right.  You know, she stands to make a lot of money if she goes to jail and comes out.  She can write a book about it.  Yes.  And that interview, somebody will pay a nice price for the first interview.  Okay.  Ugh.  Exactly.  Just listen to that.  You know...  This is the news.  And did you hear the one go, aw, only one blanket. 
[02:19:00]  What, like this, she's a tough bitch?  Right.  Who could do time with no blankets?  They would be freaking the fuck out.  Either one of them would be crying their eyes out if they had to spend one night in there.  If they didn't have their down comforter, right?  Yeah.  Oh, poor baby, only one blanket.  Yeah.  Let's eat low ham.  Whatever.  God damn.  Some fucking pictures are coming through from my party Sunday.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:19:30]  That's like girl soup in the jacuzzi.  Holy shit.  Where are these pictures?  Yeah, they're popping up on all kinds of sites now.  I guess Facebook and things like that.  But Marissa was posting a couple up here.  I'll get a hold of a few.  Send me some.  Because I need them to piece together my memories.  What the fuck did I do?  All I know is everybody said it was the greatest party ever because everyone ended up just nude. 
[02:20:00]  It was crazy.  Naked girls.  They were in the pule.  In the pule.  In the pule.  And then, yeah, once the ratio of girls started narrowing down, then it was time to just get the fuck out of the pool.  That's when I decided it was time to go and play poker, I think.  You don't remember?  No, well, I know I did play poker, but that was karaoke first. 
[02:20:30]  I think karaoke first.  And then a couple people just dropped by from down the street.  So it was naked pool, karaoke, poker?  Poker.  Pass out.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, good.  At least I got the order.  Yeah, send me pictures.  Thank you.  Cool.  Yeah, the skimmers, actually, the pool skimmers got pregnant.  Oh, really?  I had to give these skimmers abortions.  Jesus.  There were actual, there were embryos in them. 
[02:21:00]  I'm teasing, of course, that's impossible.  You ever just have one of those, though?  Go to a party that's just like, Jesus Christ, the fuck is going on?  It was a crazy party, huh?  Yeah, it was one of those just insane, when the sky, you know when the sky is kind of  turning blue, and it's like, yeah, I think this is called the next day. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, it's the next day.  Then, you know, sleep it off.  There's nothing worse than dew on potato chips.  Fucking like, when the morning comes in and the potato chips are soggy.  It's going to get soggy.  The morning dew is on it.  All your crunchy things are soft.  They're not crunchy anymore.  Yes, that's it.  I dropped in the morning after pill instead of a chlorine tab.  Pat from Unaki.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Pat.  Was Pat there?  From Unaki.  No.  No Pat. 
[02:22:00]  No Pat.  Nah.  Bunch of cops.  Bunch of cops.  Cops and chicks.  That's how I roll.  That's a good combo.  Cops and chicks.  Cops and chicks.  I wish I wasn't in Montreal.  I would love to have fucking gone to that.  I was actually annoyed I was going to be in Montreal.  Yeah.  Were you?  Yeah.  At least you made it.  Oh, I got to call Patrice.  He called me yesterday.  Oh, you know what?  He called me too.  I forgot to call him back.  He didn't leave a message this morning.  He didn't leave a message with me either.  He never does.  That's how arrogant Patrice is.  He just thinks his number pops up.  You should call him back. 
[02:22:30]  He's a pompous ass.  I feel bad though because Patrice rarely ever calls me.  So I figured there was an issue.  He called me as well and I talked to him.  Oh, what was it about?  He just basically wanted to thank us all for allowing him to get his side of the story out.  Oh, really?  As far as not getting into Canada over the weekend.  Oh.  For Rip.  For the Rip.  For the Rip.  For the Rip.  That's why we had to play the Rip.  The Rip story.  The Rip.  The Rip show yesterday to bring it all together.  Yeah.  So.  Oh, that's cool. 
[02:23:00]  Okay.  I'll give him a call back.  I just don't want, you know why?  This is the second phone call I refused from Patrice O'Neal.  And I don't want him to get an idea like that I wouldn't accept his call, but I was napping at the time.  Some black guys aren't scary and you should take their call.  Oh, no.  I absolutely know.  Patrice, I consider Patrice a friend.  Even though we never talk except on the short walk from here.  To the parking garage.  Your definition of friend is really strange. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, it is.  Because you don't really hang out with your actual friends.  No, I have like...  You sort of hang out with friends.  It's like an event and then I don't see anybody.  You have friends that you hang out with and you have friends that you don't hang out with.  I have more friends I don't hang out with.  Right.  That's what I'm getting at.  I'm trying to think if I...  What friend do I...  Alright.  I hang out with Danny.  He's a friend though.  That's pretty much it.  I can't think of anyone else that I really hang out with unless there's an event going on.  Let me think.  Nope. 
[02:24:00]  Like, I just don't.  I'd rather...  Unless there's something going on.  You know, a party or something like that.  I'd rather just sit and fucking watch TV.  It's easier that way sometimes.  Commas.  Sit and fuck and watch TV.  Ah, ha, ha.  You get it?  No, but I'd much rather do that.  But, you know, fuck around on the computer.  Just do shit like that.  Sometimes having people around is just kind of distracting.  Yeah.  I'm kind of a loner. 
[02:24:30]  I'm kind of a loner.  Sweetie.  But you have good parties.  Yeah, and I have...  So I hear.  I have good...  Weren't you in Philly or upstate?  I wasn't invited to the party.  That's what I'm getting at.  And it's okay.  Oh, no.  Well, you know what?  I didn't even get an invite.  Not even a hint.  Keith and Ange.  Are you listening?  No, I think they have a problem with me.  It's okay.  Do they?  I think they do.  I don't know what it is, but...  Oh, shit.  Maybe they can tell me.  What happened?  Because I probably should have been invited to the party at least. 
[02:25:00]  What happened?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Not on my end.  I have no fucking idea.  Is there a fucking...  Is there a controversy between the...  I have no idea.  To be honest with you.  Oh, shit.  But I probably should have been invited to the party.  And you know what?  I probably would have went.  Oh, shit.  But that's okay.  Oh, man.  It's just awkward when you're talking about the party, knowing I wasn't invited.  Now I'll have to find out.  This really reminds me of the scene in Midnight Cowboy, when they both come in and... 
[02:25:30]  I ain't even dressed for a party.  But they ain't say nothing about you.  They ain't say nothing about you.  Oh, shit.  I didn't want to go to your damn party.  Your damn party.  I would have went.  I would have went.  I would have too, actually.  I'll have to inquire with...  Don't worry about it.  It's not that important.  It's fine.  Why?  It's fine.  I honestly do think they thought you were still either upstate or in Philly. 
[02:26:00]  I want to get to the bottom of this.  Maybe there's something juicy.  Something juicy going on.  It's fine.  Anthony, the FCC took it in the shitter overnight.  We should talk about this for a few minutes.  You should be able to say that on regular radio now.  Yeah.  If it's fleeting.  Yeah.  Well, is that what they're saying?  Shut up.  It was fleeting expletives only.  Is that what the ruling was, Jimmy?  Yeah, because the scumbag FCC, when Bono goes fucking brilliant, 
[02:26:30]  they said that the network should be responsible for that.  Right.  And the New Yorker has not said you can just curse,  but the New Yorker struck that down,  saying it's too arbitrary, fleeting expletives.  And they made it a free speech issue.  They said there are too many things that will be restricted because of the vagueness of it  that should be protected speech.  Bravo.  So if an anchor guy says, fuck a chicken.  Well, you know what?  Yeah, exactly.  You know what?  I got a disc with all the things that would be fleeting. 
[02:27:00]  Ah.  And they're all quick.  Well, that's good.  This is very good news for broadcasters, by the way.  It really is.  And, Anthony, I liked your point before the show when we were talking about it.  But first, here are some examples of fleeting fucks,  which would be allowed, I guess, if this ruling stands.  Yeah, you wouldn't get fined.  For example, NBC's Sue Simmons here in New York.  At 11, pay more at the grocer, but getting less.  We'll tell you how to get the most.  The fuck are you doing?  See, that would be allowed now. 
[02:27:30]  Because she was just, she thought she was off the air.  She yelled it out.  Right.  It's more of a mistake.  I'm sure NBC in New York doesn't want Sue Simmons saying that,  but if that was to happen, the F.C. has no grounds to find him.  Now, what do you think would have happened to, what's his name, Arthur Chang?  That would be fleeting.  Yeah, that's a fleeting expletive.  He would be fine, and he wouldn't have been fired.  He might have been fired.  Oh, he might have been fired.  Because of the news, that was an F.C. issue.  Here's another example.  This is another example of a fleeting expletive. 
[02:28:00]  On Fox 5 Sky Guardian, and then check that Saturday to make your weekend plans.  It takes a tough man to make a tender forecast, Nick.  I guess that's me.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Okay, I'll do that.  All right, while we continue.  Now, the F.C. would not have any grounds there.  I'm sure, you know.  That's fleeting, though?  That's fleeting.  It's a slip of the tongue.  Keep fucking that chicken, you motherfucker.  That would be allowed.  The F.C. would not be able to get involved with that if that happened.  I'm amazed.  And then you got this from SNL. 
[02:28:30]  I freaking know.  So who's your first guest?  Are you freaking kidding me right now?  It's who it always is.  It's my freaking best friend, Donna.  Get off my freaking back.  I know it's Donna.  I was just trying to make an atmosphere.  You know what?  You freaking just threw an ashtray full of butts at my head.  You know what?  You stood up for yourself, and I fucking love you for that.  You're in my heart, babe.  You're in my heart.  All right.  I swear to God I'll do anything for my first guest.  One time...  That example sucks, but whatever.  I mean, that would be allowed. 
[02:29:00]  You know what?  I bet that was completely planned.  You think?  Yeah.  I don't know.  The bit itself, I think it was...  I think you'd get it all confused in your head.  I think they knew they weren't going to get in trouble, and it would make some fucking  news.  So I think...  You think?  Yeah.  And then you got Kathy Griffin on CNN.  I want to show you some of the newsmakers from this past year.  Just get your take on them.  Okay.  Let's not do him.  I like that it's your idea of news, first of all.  Oh, okay.  Let's do this.  Do you remember him?  All right.  Oh, that's Richard Heaney. 
[02:29:30]  Of course.  And I admire their stick-to-itiveness.  Yeah.  I admit that I followed the Balloon Boy scandal.  Now, did you watch when it was happening?  Oh, of course I did.  My favorite moment was when here, when Balloon Boy Falcon said, who the hell is Wolf?  Do you remember?  Falcon?  Falcon Heaney.  Falcon?  Falcon?  Falcon?  Falcon?  Falcon?  Falcon?  How do you say it?  I'm sure she's terrible.  She's just an ass.  CNN, though, would not be FCC because it's Canada.  Oh, that's true.  So that's not even a good example, actually.  You're right, Jimmy.  You're absolutely right.  That's all self-policing. 
[02:30:00]  Do you like Kathy Griffin?  I do.  I like her a lot, actually.  Her stand-up?  Because her show sucks.  I loved her stand-up, and I really...  I've only met her twice on Tough Crowd.  I haven't seen her in years.  She tries way too hard to be outrageous with her crowd.  I thought her stand-up was very good.  I don't know her stand-up, so I have no idea.  There's nothing to say there, but her show is awful.  I saw her stand-up before she got her show, obviously, with her special.  And she's a storyteller, and I liked her stories.  Okay.  Fair enough.  And then this is the one that started it all with Bono. 
[02:30:30]  That is really, really fucking brilliant.  And really, really great.  So all these examples, except for the CNN one, outraged the FCC.  Of course.  Court nixes FCC's indecency rules.  Four-letter words on the way, question mark.  Welcome to prime bleeping time.  TV shows can get four-letter filthy after an appeals court ruling yesterday declared the FCC's indecency rule unconstitutional.  Great.  This is great news.  Fucking great news. 
[02:31:00]  Great fucking news.  And the point Anthony made, well, you can make it.  It doesn't...  I won't change it.  It doesn't...  A what?  I don't think it'll change anything.  Well, I think a few...  I think some salty language will slip out now, like the other shows.  FX is having some...  Well, yeah, but they're another cable outlet.  Like, the cable outlets I could see.  CBS, NBC, ABC.  I don't see them fucking...  So you think they'll self-police?  ...dropping the F-bomb or saying shit or... 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, they're still gonna...  You know, it was a big deal with NYPD Blue.  Yeah, after 10 o'clock when they'd say, you know, shit.  Oh.  You know, they did that whole South Park episode about the goof when they were all waiting for them to say shit.  Right.  Well, the ruling with provocative implications for evening TV prompted cheers and jeers.  It means the F-word might soon air on a network near you.  I think it's gonna be there.  Really?  Here and there. 
[02:32:00]  Here and there.  Now, where does radio fall into this whole thing?  That's a very good question.  Because I bet radio is still gonna be policed like motherfuckers,  where groups are listening and writing things down and saying,  Ooh, he said a naughty word.  They made poopy sounds.  And my son was listening because I was driving him to work.  Or, you know, school or something.  Yeah, radio will still be fucked, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I think radio will always be fucked.  Well, the people that run radio are still gonna be cowards.  Right, yeah, they're not gonna wanna... 
[02:32:30]  Well, the same rules are in place.  Let's just, you know...  Just because this happened, don't you worry about it.  But the fact that they said it's unconstitutional...  Yeah.  ...and they said that there are certain things that should be protected speech and total...  This is where I like the idea of a liberal Supreme Court.  It's weird with, like, different things.  It kind of ebbs and flows.  And when it comes to our business, for us, believe me,  a liberal court is much better because they don't harp on language as much. 
[02:33:00]  They're not as concerned with porn and that nonsense that the conservatives go ballistic over.  It just amazes me that either side, it should just be what it is.  It really should just be allowed.  The Constitution should be interpreted not by a conservative or a liberal.  Because they're gonna see things two different fucking ways, that's for sure.  But it's like they're both assholes.  They just...  Certain sides obsess more on certain things.  Yeah, of course.  Uh, the court says that dropping the F-bomb on primetime TV in front of kids is okay, 
[02:33:30]  said Dan Isip of the Parents Television Council.  The door has been kicked down!  Ooh, Dan, maybe it's time for you to sit your little shitty kids in front of a video  and stop telling them to watch award shows like adults, you fuck.  Fuck you, you dumb kids.  I got a lot of nephews and a lot of nieces, and this is nothing to them.  No.  To hear this shit in fucking school.  Why are we all making believe that we gotta protect them from dirty words? 
[02:34:00]  Because the parents...  It's unbelievable.  The Parents Tele...  What's it called?  Uh, Parents...  Uh, Parents Television Council.  The Parents Television Council.  What they are is they're a bunch of fucking PTA twats, and the men too, and that is their  existence.  So without that, they cease to feel like they have any validity as people.  Yeah, no purpose.  That's where all their energy is.  Did you see what we got?  Did you read the newsletter?  Did you get the email?  We got results! 
[02:34:30]  Meanwhile, their dumb fucking kids are 18 and 20.  Oh, they're fucking giving blowjobs already.  They got the husbands out fucking.  Fucking.  Fucking.  The wife's got nothing to do.  Stick an old haggard pussy next to the dryer with an uneven load in it.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Very imaginative.  Yeah.  She's gotta get off.  I read that in Penthouse Forum once.  I thought it was hot.  Yeah, it's very hot.  The group side with the FCC, and again, six intelligence stations, including Fox, ABC, and 
[02:35:00]  CBS, what, I am shocked by such an anti-family decision, said FCC Commissioner Michael Copps.  Is that a douchebag?  He really is.  A real douchebag.  Yeah.  How is that anti-family?  And they want to get involved with the internet and fucking satellite radio, these scumbags.  Yeah, fuck everything up.  How is that anti-family?  It's not.  It's reality.  It's happening all around your children.  It's what it is.  And you give the word, it's an old argument, but you give the word so much power. 
[02:35:30]  By saying you can't, you don't have this on TV, or have this on radio.  Michael Copps is a jizz bucket.  He's a jizz bucket.  Completely agree.  This decision gives them the unfettered ability to air whatever content they want.  Yeah, well, cable has that, and they show responsibility with the whole thing.  Yep.  Nothing would change for at least 45 days until the case is ultimately decided, because  they could appeal, obviously.  The ruling only applies to broadcast TV in prime time and not to cable television, which 
[02:36:00]  is the biggest joke, because we were talking about that as well.  At this point in the year 2010, you turn on your TV, it's just TV.  It's not like that.  You're not differentiating.  I'm not helping.  But it's, you know what I mean, you don't real, I'm really fucked.  I'm really fucked.  This is going to be on a blooper reel.  I feel like Voss right now. 
[02:36:30]  You had it.  Differentiate.  I can't do it.  You almost had it.  I think you got it.  Differentiate.  Oh.  Differentiate?  Yep.  Okay.  Sweating over here.  Between cable shows and shows that are over the air, or whatever they call it.  Yeah, I don't know how many people have antennas and are just getting broadcast television  anymore.  When you first got cable, it was very obvious, but now it's just what it is.  Now it's television, you turn it on, there's a fuckload of channels, and you're not thinking, 
[02:37:00]  oh, this is network, and this is cable, and they could do this here, or they can't do  it here.  At this point, it's the same shit.  It's the same thing.  So just let everyone curse if they want.  Yeah.  If some are cursing, then what's the difference?  You watch a show like Rescue Me, Janine pointed out that Adam, my buddy there, Adam,  he said cock.  He said cock there last night on the show.  It's a good season, by the way, in that Rescue Me.  They're having a fine season.  Yeah, it's a good show. 
[02:37:30]  And then you go to a show on ABC or CBS, I wouldn't be shocked if it was a dramatic  show and I heard him say cock or shit.  I would probably go like, wow, the network's finally catching on.  The FCC is just not important anymore.  I mean, these companies are policing themselves.  We learned that the hard way at CBS Radio.  Everything we did was within FCC guidelines, but they have their own set of rules.  rules that are way worse than what the FCC is allowing. 
[02:38:00]  Way worse.  Yep.  Way the fuck worse.  And that's going to continue.  Yep.  They'll police themselves.  So don't worry about it, Michael Copps.  This is anti-family.  If it stands, the decision would end the policy of finding broadcasters for foul language put  in place after Bono used the F word on the January 2003 NBC broadcast of the Golden Globes  awards.  That's seven years ago already.  Wow.  The FCC's indecency policy is unconstitutional because it is impermissibly vague, the second 
[02:38:30]  U.S. Circuit Court said.  Great.  That's awesome.  The ruling touched on everything from George Carlin's famous seven words you can never say  on TV to foul words by Nicole Richie on a Billboard Music Awards show.  One of several cases that led to the decision.  The decision was filled with words routinely bleeped out on television from bullshit to dickhead.  That's great.  Did they actually write from bullshit?  No, they had the dash dash.  I was able to figure that out. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  I was going to say, wow.  That's pretty good.  After years of experience, I was able to figure that one out.  Ah, bullshit.  You know, Canada is better than us with language and sex.  The whole world is better than us.  But they're terrible with anything that's considered racist or homophobic.  And I would love to know.  Well, I think they took the license of a station in Quebec a few years ago over shock jocks  that said something.  I would love to know what it was that they said.  But they really are.  They're not better than we are here. 
[02:39:30]  To me, there's much more vagueness if it's hate speech.  They really are pathetic.  And I got to do Canadian TV next Sunday, which is why I'm kind of wondering.  I guarantee it.  Nothing racial.  No.  Nothing.  I can't wait to hear about your experience with that, Jimmy.  So I'm curious as to what they got in trouble for, those Canadian shock jocks, if anybody  knows.  Let me see.  According to this survey, 51% of U.S. households have cable TV.  26% receive their television via satellite. 
[02:40:00]  1% have both.  22% have neither.  You're trying to tell me that 22% of America still doesn't have cable TV?  About a quarter of the country just doesn't have, like, anything.  What do they have?  The antenna?  Antenny?  Get the fuck out of here.  That's got to be fucking, like, in the Adirondacks, the white trash, fucking no-shoe-wearing  hillbillies.  Because old people?  I feel like you can't afford it.  Old people.  No!  Sorry.  Yeah, I can't.  No, that was going to be my argument. 
[02:40:30]  When I was dirt poor, I always figured out how to have cable TV.  That was the one thing I always tried to figure out.  Always.  Fail it.  Steal it?  Yeah, it's harder to steal.  See, and if I stole it, I would say I don't have it.  So that's probably a bad stat.  Even poor people figure out a way to get kids.  Poor people.  Poor.  Differentiate.  See, I can say it now.  I don't know what happens sometimes.  What the fuck?  It just pops up.  I'm a dope, and my kid's a genius. 
[02:41:00]  I don't know what to tell you.  Kid rolled over already.  What?  Yeah.  Holy snitch on.  Hey, rolled over.  You want baby talk for 30 seconds?  Hey, yeah.  Well done the questioning.  See, when you have a kid, you have to do what's called belly time.  What?  So they kind of lift up and stuff, and you get their neck and everything strong, right?  Ow.  And so you put him on his belly, he struggles for a while, and then you fucking pick him up  when you see his color starting to get a little too red in the face.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:41:30]  Talking to the parents now, Ed.  I'm sorry.  No, what is that?  What?  Who figured out this was good?  You got to, I don't know.  It teaches them, I don't know what it actually does, to be honest with you.  But the pediatrician goes, belly time, every day.  Make sure you do it.  I'm like, all right.  So the other day, the kid just turned two months old.  I guess this is going to sound like bragging, but it's also a little fucked up.  I put him on his belly, and he flips onto his back like it was nothing.  I go, did I just see that?  Because all the books say that that takes three to four months in.  Easy. 
[02:42:00]  So I put him on his belly again, and he does it again, over and over again.  I got it on fucking tape.  Do you weigh his arms down?  And Dr. Stevens said it's fucked up.  That should not be happening this early.  Well, then don't let him do it.  No, you want him to do it.  So then in the middle of the night, you can get a good night.  Duft tape him down.  In the middle of the night, you can start getting a good night's sleep knowing he could  maybe take care of himself instead of landing on his fucking nose and suffocating himself.  You don't want to do that.  So this is good news for a new father.  Good news.  And I'm a dummy.  So is he driving? 
[02:42:30]  I'm thinking about it.  Give him about another year or two, designated driver.  I got philosophy on all that.  I might have to write a book.  Yeah.  Why is it when...  I was thinking about this yesterday when I was walking home.  When did you learn to drive?  No, you're not the right person to ask.  I know.  Ridiculous.  See, I was 19.  Really?  19.  All right.  So this is for you.  So I think I was 18.  Was it 18 when we were growing up?  Learner's permit, 16, 17?  What was it?  Yeah, yeah.  Learner's permit, 16.  So why is it that your dad all of a sudden, when you turn 17, let's say, goes, all right, 
[02:43:00]  time to start learning how to drive.  Why wouldn't you throw your fucking kid in a car at 14 in a parking lot?  Exactly.  So by the time he's 17, he really knows what the fuck he's doing.  Instead of getting a learner's permit like I did, we went to the DMV.  I've told this story a few times.  I turned 17, time to get your fucking learner's permit, did the paperwork, and all of a sudden  my dad goes, okay, drive.  And I looked down, I'm like, I've never drove before.  I don't know what I'm doing.  Even though I have a learner's permit now, I've never fucking sat behind the wheel of 
[02:43:30]  a car.  But my dad was brave, and I swear to you, it was, I forgot where, it's in Comac there?  Where the fuck is the DMV?  And I went around a turn, way too fast, into oncoming traffic, and almost fucking killed  us.  Within five minutes of having my learner's permit.  You realize, never do that again.  Well, that's great.  I survived.  But why not take your fucking kid at 14, when no one's looking, and you get a big fucking  parking lot, and start teaching him some shit.  At least the basics.  And then at 17, he's a bit more experienced, and then you don't have to worry that he's 
[02:44:00]  going to, you know, crack his skull in an accident.  That's true.  Kenny?  I used to let my kids sit on my lap and steer.  They couldn't hit the pedals.  That old gag.  Yeah, but I used to let them steer when they were little.  See, that's smart, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you could hold them back if something happens.  They wouldn't hit their head on the steering wheel, I'm sure.  Yeah.  And then when my older son was 16, I took him to a parking lot, you know, so he could  drive around and learn how to parallel park and stuff. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  I had my younger son, who was, you know, four years younger, and I let him take a couple  laps around the lot.  A couple of spins.  I think as a parent, that's the smartest thing you could do.  Yeah.  And then he's very experienced when he gets his learner's permit.  Yeah.  Why not?  There's animals out there on the road.  Yeah, you gotta know what you're doing out there.  And you know what?  Now you got texting and talking on the phone and dialing, so you really gotta know what  you're doing.  When does Turlet training start there, Kenny?  Because I got, I'm gonna start putting him on the fucking toilet. 
[02:45:00]  Just put him on the goddamn toilet.  So he's not scared shitless of it.  Yeah.  You gotta get him a little potty.  No, but when do you start that shit?  I know this is down the road.  Yeah, I forget exactly.  But it, with that too, why not every day you do a little Turlet time?  You'd sit his stupid hiney on the toilet so he's not scared of it.  Because the kid's trying to enjoy his life.  He doesn't want to just sit on a giant hole he could fall through.  No, I'll get the fucking little one that they get.  Yeah, the kid has a little potty.  Not to put him on, hoping that he's gonna start shitting in it right away, but you get 
[02:45:30]  him comfortable.  How great would that be?  You get him comfortable with this stuff.  Can't even walk.  Boys are harder than girls to potty train.  Why is that?  I don't know.  I remember my kids, they used to hold it in.  They didn't want to take a shit.  That's a control thing, by the way.  Yeah.  I wonder who they got that from.  No kidding.  I like three peas and two carrots.  I'll have nine blueberries for dessert.  I'm a good parent.  I know you're a good parent. 
[02:46:00]  You do have a control thing, though, Kenny.  You do control things.  I also realize he can't multitask, because we were driving home yesterday, and he missed  our turn.  I'm like, what happened?  He goes, I was thinking about that other thing.  I'm like, can't you think about that other thing and make the right turn?  No, I was distracted.  Kenny can't multitask.  Yeah.  Yeah, you get distracted real easy.  Not when it comes with deductive reasoning, like doing two thoughts at the same time.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wish the radio audience could see his dopey smile right now. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, and his little nervous shaking legs, his hands in his pockets all sheepish.  With his zoot suit on.  Yeah.  Yeah, you should be spinning a fucking watch, yelling, keep on trucking.  That.  A lot of good calls, but whatever.  But I think that's the way to go.  Know it?  Get him in a car early.  Why not?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Especially in a big parking lot.  Who's he going to hurt? 
[02:47:00]  My kid almost killed us.  They do hurt someone, God forbid.  They had like go-karts and dirt bikes, too, when they were little.  So by the time they had...  Yeah.  So when it was time to drive a car, you weren't as nervous.  You get the hand-eye coordination thing going with driving and stuff.  Yeah, my father threw me in a fucking dual buggy at like 12 or 13.  I think that's the smartest thing.  Out in the middle of the Mojave Desert.  Smart.  I was slamming four gears.  Bah, bah, bah.  In a fucking dune buggy down dirt roads with tons of weapons in the back. 
[02:47:30]  What a time.  That's perfect.  Oh, what a time.  That's where I learned to drive drunk, too.  See?  You're a better person for it, obviously, too.  Of course.  Right?  Much better.  Not a problem in the world.  Just skip through life with my shoelaces untied.  That's a good way to fall and chip your teeth, right?  Ah, and what, my teeth?  What's that?  What do you mean?  Nothing.  I'm sorry.  Oh, all right.  I just got a thumbs up.  All right, that ends baby talk for today. 
[02:48:00]  I'm sorry for the people that don't give a shit.  I understand.  I know you're out there.  It hit with somebody.  Hey, Mel Gibson and The Shining.  Oh!  Who did this?  D-Boy?  D-Boy, the remixes are just flying in.  Because we also have Mel Gibson versus Double Rainbow.  The Double Rainbow.  You've got to establish Double Rainbow guy first.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't have the audio in front of me right now.  Double Rainbow, man?  I don't know.  Yeah, you do.  Full on.  I'll find it for you.  It's there.  Are you a fan of Double Rainbow?  Love the Double Rainbow.  But do you not like the parody of Double-licious? 
[02:48:30]  Was it Double-licious?  Yeah, I wasn't really.  I like the song that does an auto-tune.  The guys that do that auto-tune in the news.  I didn't hear the auto-tune, I'll be honest.  They really did a good job.  All right, where's that fucking dick?  Yeah, off I hang.  All right, in the meantime, here's Mel Gibson in The Shining.  Fucking embarrassment to me.  You look like a fucking bitch on heat.  And if you get raped by a pack of niggers, it'll be your fault.  Yes.  All right?  Okay?  I don't want you.  What are you talking about? 
[02:49:00]  I don't believe you anymore.  I don't trust you.  I don't love you.  I just want to go back to my room.  I don't want you.  Okay?  But I don't want you anymore.  I'm very confused.  Fucking listen to me.  I just made a chance to think things over.  Listen to my fucking ranting.  Listen to what you're doing to me.  You don't make my life so fucking difficult.  Don't hurt me.  Stay away from me.  Stay away.  Stay away from me.  Stay away from me.  You don't care. 
[02:49:30]  You don't care.  I'm threatening you.  I'll put you in a fucking rose garden, you cunt.  You understand that?  Please.  Do it.  Fucking sounds like it's The Shining.  It sounds like a scene from the actual show.  Wow.  That is great.  Damn.  Mel Gibson in The Shining.  God damn it.  That's good.  I'm going to get some of these online because they're way better than the ones I've been seeing.  Oh, yeah.  Way better. 
[02:50:00]  That's good.  Way the fuck better.  God damn it.  You want to get into Double...  Have you seen Double Rainbow?  The video?  Double Rainbow.  It is...  This is a part two?  What is it?  There is.  Part two.  Part one, part two.  Huh?  The original video is...  It's kind of long, so I just cut it up, so, you know.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Double Rainbow.  This fucking guy, I don't know, somewhere out west, he witnessed a Double Rainbow, and  he just showed his excitement. 
[02:50:30]  You don't even need the video.  This is fucking mind over stupid Rainbow.  This thing is taking over YouTube, just growing by the day.  Wow, three million...  What is that one?  Fucking almost four million views on one version of the video.  All the way.  Wait, wait, start it over.  Fuck it, let's just play the video.  Whoa, that's a full rainbow.  All the way.  Double Rainbow.  Oh, my God.  It's a double rainbow all the way.  Whoa, that's so intense. 
[02:51:00]  Whoa, man.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Woo.  Oh, wow.  Woo.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  It's starting to even look like a triple rainbow.  Oh, my God.  It's full on.  Double rainbow all the way across the sky.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, my God.  Jimmy looks disgusting.  Can you pause it for a second?  What's wrong, Jimmy?  A, I see one rainbow and a half of another one.  There's a double rainbow.  No, it's full on.  B, it almost looks like triple rainbow.  You don't see double rainbow?  It's double rainbow.  I see.  I see. 
[02:52:30]  Fall on.  Fall on.  Fall on.  Across the sky.  I see double rainbow.  Sounds like Jodie Foster going under the thing.  Dr. Lecter.  Double rainbow.  Rainbow.  Did the rancher make you look at the rainbows?  Did he sodomize you?  No.  Here's a very decent manic depressive.  And B.  If you see a double rainbow, call the snubber.  It's a great big double rainbow. 
[02:53:00]  And you think someday if you see a double rainbow, your lambs will stop booing.  But this guy.  It's like even if it is.  Even if it is a double rainbow.  Even if it is.  It is.  I'm looking at the video.  I see a double rainbow.  First of all, this cocksucker is not filming the entire double rainbow.  He's filming fucking a half of the double rainbow.  He sounds like the chief from Cuckoo's Nest having a stroke. 
[02:53:30]  It's a double rainbow.  I fucking hate this guy.  You don't like double rainbow guy?  No.  Can you show more of this?  He's not fucking showing you see the beginning of the rainbow, but you don't see.  Yeah, where's double rainbow?  Where's the top?  There's double rainbow.  There it goes.  Oh, my God.  It's so bright and vivid.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I hope that sound right there is his cancer growing. 
[02:54:00]  I hope that's why.  I hope it hurts.  It's just showing excitement.  My pancreas is getting worse.  Oh.  But the double rainbow.  Oh.  The lump on my thyroid is now the size of a melon.  He's seeing a double rainbow.  So beautiful.  You know what?  You should have this reaction when you're getting a blowjob, and instead you see two mouths  on your dick.  Oh.  It's a double blowjob. 
[02:54:30]  There was only one mouth, and now there's two.  It's beautiful.  Why are you spoiling it?  He's very excited over his double rainbow.  So what?  It's a fucking...  It's something that happens when it rains.  Who gives a shit?  It's some weird thing the light does if the water hits it.  Of course.  Who gives a fuck?  It's two puddles.  It's the same miracle of nature.  Oh, look.  It's steam evaporation. 
[02:55:00]  Let's get back into double rainbow.  He's crying because he saw the double rainbow.  What an emotional wreck.  I hope he...  I know why he's crying.  Why?  He's actually camping because he's on the lam because he bombed an abortion clinic.  This fucking asshole.  Double rainbows.  Like two fetuses that will live. 
[02:55:30]  Thanks to killing the devil's doctor.  This guy sucks.  See, it fades out.  Where's the top of the second fucking rainbow?  Double rainbow.  He's a liar.  Should end in double mountain lion attack.  Or a fucking...  A murder-suicide. 
[02:56:00]  A double tragedy.  A double rainbow.  Oh, my front yard.  Right in his front yard.  A double rainbow.  Study it, Jimmy.  It's right there if you look for it.  I still don't know if he's losing it.  Oh, my God.  What does it mean?  What does it mean, Jimmy?  Jake, pause.  I'd like to answer him.  He asked, what does it mean?  I'd like to answer this, man.  Okay.  It means that you're a fucking... 
[02:56:30]  You're probably bipolar.  Bipolar, you emotional asshole.  The rainbows mean nothing.  No.  Your blubbering, however, is a sign of mental illness.  This is the same type of guy.  He's crying like this.  This is the same type of guy who would laugh  as he was sawing through a prostitute's head with an axe.  The Lord is going to thank me.  Are we almost done with the double rainbow? 
[02:57:00]  He's crying now.  Too much.  This is how I feel when I drive past a junior high.  That's how you fucking felt when you saw Jungle Fever.  Oh, my God.  It's so intense.  It's a double rainbow, but I'll only film one.  This guy's awful.  Oh, my God. 
[02:57:30]  Got over it.  That's it.  The double rainbow video.  He got over double rainbow.  It meant nothing.  Double rainbows mean less than nothing.  It is just water.  Refracting light.  Yeah.  That's all.  The other thing.  I hit the handle, and the water goes in a circle  and takes my duty away. 
[02:58:00]  Full on.  Double tapered.  In the bowl.  Full on.  Double tapered.  It was a double clogger.  My duty went around two times.  It's double duty.  What do you think it means?  It's circled twice before leaving it to the sewer system.  Full on in my toilet.  What does it mean?  I hit.  I turned the hot and the cold, 
[02:58:30]  and double jets of water caught my body  and removed the soap.  Something tells me he doesn't know what the fuck that means.  This guy.  Washing.  Is an asshole.  Yes.  An asshole.  You think he's on shrooms or something, though?  Rainbow.  I don't know, man.  I think Jimmy's right.  I think he's got, like, some kind of mental problem.  Really?  Yeah, he's a bipolar fuck.  Well, there's an interview with this guy,  and he claims that, although he wasn't high in this video. 
[02:59:00]  Uh-oh.  Is that him?  Yes, it is.  Oh, that's him?  Indeed.  Oh, my fucking God.  It's Hurley on the island.  Yeah, exactly.  A double D bra for me,  because I'm a fat pig.  Why don't you state in the obvious?  It's Steve C.  It looks like the cover of a Foundry album.  Oh, Jesus.  Yes.  A double watermark.  Yeah.  A double whopper. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, my God.  A double dung dildo.  It's full on in my ass and in other men's.  What does it mean?  Every time men are on TV,  I get a tent in my underpants.  What does it mean?  Full on.  Hard on.  That's Steve C. before the surgery.  Who are you kidding?  And after. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, well.  Well.  Well, see.  Double balls on my churn.  What does it mean?  Holy shit.  A double exhale from Lane Bryant.  That's right.  Fucking A, man. 
[03:00:30]  That really does look like him in the pendulum, David.  It really, really looks like Steve.  My website and band.  A double failure.  Take that, stupid.  Get to work.  What does it mean?  Fucking Steve C all the way in his rock days. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, wow.  A double income.  All the way.  That's right.  Oh, double click.  And I get paid for the link.  What does it mean?  A double stapling.  Why did I do it?  Full on double bosses know I do nothing. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, man.  Oh.  I can see.  Rainbow guy rules.  Can we play the song, please?  Full on.  The song is actually amazing.  The song is fantastic.  What is the song?  Someone took what he was saying there in auto-tune.  Oh, yeah.  But rat spit from Pal Talk.  Rainbow swing back to the other way.  Other way.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's the auto-tune song.  When does a rainbow get out of my way?  Power from Nagy. 
[03:02:00]  Portion control.  What does it mean?  Yes.  You ate through your operation.  No, thank you.  What does it mean?  Double helping.  Yes, I'll have that.  I'm full.  What does it mean?  Double breakfast.  Did you do salad?  What does it mean?  Low-fat dressing. 
[03:02:30]  What does it mean?  Calorie counting.  Double glory hole.  Two penises.  Full on.  Double stuffed.  Right in my own backyard.  Double penetration.  My mouth and ass.  Full of dick.  It's beautiful.  Oh, God.  It's almost a triple stuffing. 
[03:03:00]  They're fucking.  They're fucking my stomach staple hole.  Oh, look.  It's double stuff Oreo.  Good one.  Yes.  I weigh double what most people do.  Full double rainbow sticker on the back of my car.  Oh, thank you.  Is that Nicholas?  Did you do double bypass yet?  No.  That wouldn't work, too. 
[03:03:30]  Almost triple bypass.  He really looks like Steve.  Yes.  Oh, Steve took a beating.  Sorry, Steve.  You look just like the fucking guy.  Desert.  Yes.  I have a place in the woods.  I can run around.  Nobody calls me incompetent.  No.  A man on horseback took my picture once and sold it.  Yes.  As they poured plaster into my footprints.  How do you stay fat in the desert, by the way? 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, that guy is fat.  How the fuck do you stay fat?  Oh, my God.  Because he just sits there looking at stupid rainbows.  Okay, why don't we play it?  So, what is this?  The auto-tune of the original double rainbow?  Yeah, it's actually really good.  Let's check it out.  What the hell?  I believe you, Dad.  Whoa, that's a full rainbow all the way.  Double rainbow.  Oh, my God.  Double rainbow.  It's a double rainbow all the way.  Damn.  It's a double rainbow all the way. 
[03:04:30]  Damn.  Oh, my God.  What does this mean?  It's so dry and so vivid.  Double rainbow.  Double rainbow.  It's so intense.  It's so intense.  What does this mean?  It's starting to look like a triple rainbow.  That's a whole rainbow, man.  Double rainbow all the way across the ground.  So intense.  Double rainbow all the way across the ground. 
[03:05:00]  Whoa, whoa, oh, my God.  Look at that rainbow.  Double rainbow all the way across the ground.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's full of arms.  I can't even capture it on my camera.  Double rainbow all the way across the ground.  Yeah, yeah.  So intense.  Double rainbow all the way across the ground. 
[03:05:30]  Wow, wow, oh, my God.  Look at that rainbow.  Woo!  Woo!  That is the baddest f***ing rainbow I've ever seen.  What the f***?  That's pretty good.  Yeah, it's not bad at all.  That's not bad.  That's why it was hard to watch any of the other, like, remix-style videos, because, like,  that was the first one I saw, so everything else really couldn't really compare.  Well, Danny doesn't like it, but I do.  The Double Down or the Double-licious, I forgot. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  Me and Travis watched it.  I was like, whatever.  There are some really bad parody videos of this out there.  Double Down's pretty bad.  I think it's pretty good.  I'll have to give it another shot.  It's on Break.com.  Break.com thought it was good enough to put on their front page.  Give those guys a plug today.  They've been very, very good to us over the years.  Break.com for the Double Down parody.  Why don't we end this segment with the Mel Gibson versus Double Rainbow guy?  Well, we might as well.  Put together by Derek.  Derek is just remixing his ass off with this Mel Gibson audio. 
[03:06:30]  And we're encouraging you to do the same and send it into the show.  All right?  After the break, Mike DiStefano, our old friend.  He's on Last Comic Stand and doing very, very well.  So we'll talk to him next and see how that's going for him.  Okay?  But first this.  Whoa, that's a full rainbow.  What the?  All the way.  What?  Double rainbow.  Oh, my God.  Get the fuck out.  It's a double rainbow all the way.  You're a dishonest cunt.  Oh, my God. 
[03:07:00]  Wow.  Woo!  Yeah!  No!  I don't understand you.  You're saying stupid shit.  How dare you fucking even insult me with some of the stupid reasoning you have?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's starting to even look like a triple rainbow.  The fuck is that?  Your logic sucks because you're a fucking mentally deprived idiot. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, my God.  It's full on.  Double rainbow all the way across the sky.  Fuck you.  Get the fuck away from me.  Oh, my God.  What does this mean?  Follow me.  I have a gadget, bitch.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  On the virus.  Serious accent.  My heart is heavy.  I'm getting cold. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  It's angry and something that I just can't control.  It's a cheesy girl that makes me out of my way.  That's the love is way back.  The other way.  The other way.  We got Mike DiStefano in studio.  Friend of the show, by the way.  I was just telling Mike down the hall.  I checked out Last Comic Standing.  I had no idea that he was even auditioning for this damn thing.  And he's doing great.  He's still in it.  There's, what, ten comics left?  Yeah.  There's ten left.  Thank you. 
[03:08:30]  Unbelievable.  Congratulations.  I came in today to promote my new CD, OK Karma.  That's why I came in.  But we could talk about Last Comic.  I just can't really, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can't just be going around publicity.  Hounding to get votes.  None of that.  Right.  That's not why I'm here.  No.  You don't want to vote for me.  Don't fucking vote for me.  Perfect.  You know what I mean?  I don't really give a shit, to be honest with you.  What is, uh, how many, there's ten guys left?  Yeah, there's ten left.  It just aired Monday, the top ten show.  I'm one episode behind.  I DVR'd it, so.  Yeah, just aired Monday night. 
[03:09:00]  I didn't see Monday's show.  We'll see.  I did good.  It was a good set, so I'm pretty confident I'll be all right.  But who knows, really.  The audience loves you.  The judges love you.  Greg Giraldo is the judge on Last Comic Standing.  And he's been doing really good.  Yeah.  Really well, I should say.  Yeah, I've been liking it.  I can't believe this is how it's happening for me.  Like, all these years, you know, we all want to get a break, they call it.  This is the last thing I would have thought in the fucking world would have been it.  Last Comic.  And look what Last Comic Standing did for Rich Voss. 
[03:09:30]  So, I mean, your career is...  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  He had a little pull for about six months, and then went back to doing firehouses.  I say, look at what Bonnie McFarlane did for Rich Voss.  No, honestly, Voss did very well because of Last Comic Standing.  Absolutely, yeah.  Very well.  Hey, listen, the people get to see it.  Let's face it.  You know what I mean?  You get to a point where you're looking for more and more freedom to say what you want  to say.  I'm not even close to that point yet.  People come to go, man, I love this shit you talk about. 
[03:10:00]  You're honest.  No, I'm not.  I'm so full of shit at this point because I can't, you know, and I don't know if Jimmy  can relate to this anymore, but I mean, well, you've always had this home here, the Open  Anthony home, which is great, where you have a gig.  A lot of us don't have anything in the beginning, and it takes a long fucking time to have a  little bit of power where you don't give a shit anymore, you know, where you have what  they call fuck you money, which to me is $47,000.  When I make 47 grand, I'm going off.  Oh, yeah, I'm going berserk.  That's a cheap fuck you. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  When does the show air again?  Monday nights at 9 p.m.  Eastern Standard.  Now you've got Andy Kindler as one of the judges.  I can't figure that guy out.  Is he a prick?  Not at all.  I know he's a funny guy and all that, but he's a strange bird.  I don't...  I can't figure that asshole out.  Yeah, I've never met him.  I'm sorry.  Maybe I shouldn't be here.  No, no.  You can say whatever you want.  Listen, I'm here to just talk about my OK karma.  Geraldo, very easy to talk to.  Andy Kindler, I'm not sure.  I know Andy a long time.  He's very funny, and he's a nice guy.  He really is a nice guy. 
[03:11:00]  To me, he's...  They're all...  Listen, I went in there.  For the audition process, I wrote a whole three minutes telling the judges to go and fuck  their mothers.  I had this...  Because I knew they were going to say, no, get out of here.  And I was going to rip them to shreds, including Geraldo, who's a friend.  I had this awful shit written about cancer and dying and all that.  And they said, yes, we like you.  And I still told them to go fuck themselves.  You know, my favorite part of Last Comic Standing, you mentioned Geraldo, is the fact 
[03:11:30]  that because we're lucky to know all you guys...  Yeah.  I don't know if that's lucky, by the way, but we do know all you guys.  Geraldo will talk to these comedians up there like he's never met them before.  And I'm like, Geraldo, you hang out with Jim David at the Comedy Cellar.  Yeah.  And now you have to critique his act that you've been watching for the last 10 years  up close and personal, but you've got to make believe for the show, you don't even know  this fucking guy.  Yeah, I don't know.  Like, I don't...  Which is so strange to me.  Yeah, well, Greg's just a real dude in general. 
[03:12:00]  No, I'm not trashing him.  He's got a gig and he's got to, you know, do it properly.  Yeah.  He can't tell everyone, oh, I know Jim David.  We're friends, you know?  You know, this year the show...  Actually, this year the show has been pretty much out in the open as far as...  Everyone knew that I knew Greg.  I mean, every comic knows Greg Geraldo.  A lot of comics know Andy Kindler.  The girl, Natasha, nobody knows.  Yeah, where's she from?  She's beautiful.  I think she is beautiful.  She's smart.  And I think she's hysterical personally.  Do we know...  She's just been on some TV stuff. 
[03:12:30]  I didn't know her until the morning I met her doing that...  She's been on something I've seen.  I can't...  She's on Chelsea Lately often.  Okay, she's part of the...  That's probably where I've seen her.  Yeah, and she's actually fantastic.  You know what I mean?  She's really good.  Yeah, and there is one comic, thank God they got rid of her, because she was doing Amy  Schumer's act, and it was pissing me the fuck off.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah, I don't know her name, but, you know, she's, I guess, a new comic, and I was wishing  that one of the judges would go, whoa, we got that already. 
[03:13:00]  Her name's Amy Schumer.  What are you doing?  Yeah, I mean, it was almost exact.  Yeah, I don't know.  I couldn't even...  I don't even know what you're talking about.  I kind of know the show, Ann.  I'm sorry.  No, no, it's fine.  I haven't been watching them.  It's all stand-up this year, too, which is good for you guys.  None of that house shit?  Yeah, it's just stand-up.  None of that hacky crap.  That's great.  No, there's no contests or nothing.  I pretty much said that in the beginning.  If you have any kind of contest planned or any of that, I'm not going to do it.  I'm not going to do the show.  And they assured me and whoever else asked, hey, we're just doing stand-up. 
[03:13:30]  They really are trying to make the show different this year.  Next year, they want real comics to want to do the show.  That's their goal.  And, you know, listen, the only way they're going to pull it off is if I win or Laurie Kilmartin wins.  Yeah, Laurie's been around forever, too.  Yeah, you know, they're looking for some real comics.  You know what?  Hmm, okay.  So we'll see.  Yeah, because some of that hacky stuff you think made comics not want to do the show.  Oh, absolutely.  I never wanted to do the show.  I would have never done the show.  I mean, I just went, and Voss happened to be there the night I went there to go watch the show or the actual live show. 
[03:14:00]  And I said, you know what?  The comics that won it were fucking great.  There were a lot of great New York guys doing the show.  I said, I'm going to give it a shot.  And it worked out.  I'm glad I did.  Yeah, Mikey has a really good shot of winning this whole thing.  So how do we vote for you?  Thank you.  I guess on Monday night, they give out a number.  So every Monday from now until the end of the show, they're going to give out a phone number that people will call to vote.  And, you know, like I say, vote for whoever you think is good, you know?  I mean, I don't, you know, technically a guy like me shouldn't win because I don't have, I don't know if I have the appeal to middle America that some of these other people do. 
[03:14:30]  So I need to get people out there that usually wouldn't vote.  I don't have the appeal to any America.  Well, no.  Who, me?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's fine.  I didn't get that.  I'm fucking with you.  No, that's okay.  I just didn't know you.  I think you do have a middle America appeal because you're brash and you're very honest.  I think that's, there's an appeal.  I think people in middle America probably like you a lot more than some fucking smug comic who's trying to be ironic and not honest. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, I'm sick of.  You talk about race.  I think, I think middle America likes it a lot, actually.  You know what I'm sick of, man, in comedy?  Forget about last comic.  Oh, sorry.  Well, actually, the, the, um, is this whole clever thing.  People that are just smart mentally, but they got no fucking heart.  You know what I mean?  I, I, I know I'm not, listen, I got a long way to go before I'm as good a comic as I would like to be.  All this stuff. 
[03:15:30]  I'm not, I'm not a fucking egomaniac, but.  How long are you going to give this?  Well, I'm going to five more years.  That's it.  In five years, I'm going back to.  Long way to go.  Holy shit.  How long have you been at it?  I, 10 years.  Oh, that's it?  Yeah, I'm a little old.  I, I started old.  I didn't start, you know, I haven't been doing it very long.  You had that drug thing going on, right?  Yeah, I started off with the drugs, you know what I mean?  It, that propelled me into.  Someone asked me today, how do you feel about, uh, Steinbrenner?  I'm like, if you added up all the loved ones I've lost, they don't equal 80.  Fuck him.  You know what I'm saying?  Come on.  Not that fuck him, but he's 80.  He had a heart attack at 80. 
[03:16:00]  God bless him.  He did good.  We would all take that one.  Exactly.  If I lived to 50, it's amazing.  I would take a massive at 80.  No problem.  Yeah, Anthony, too.  I mean, you're, you're on your fucking way.  He's like me.  The fucking simmering, constant anger, low-grade state of misery, punctuated by rage.  That's me.  Yeah, it's, you know.  We don't have long to go.  That's why I, gotta take, gotta take a breath every so often.  That's it.  And, you know, lay off the fucking pork and maybe do a push-up.  Something, yeah.  That's wild.  Nah, all right, so I didn't know they didn't do the house shit. 
[03:16:30]  No, none of the house, none of that garbage.  I kind of hated that.  Yeah.  Because I've liked the show since it started, I don't know how many years ago now.  Enough of the house shit with any fucking show.  Enough of the house.  I remember once they brought all these comics to a laundromat and they had to perform in a laundromat.  Yeah, yeah, I would have stuffed somebody in the fucking machine.  Horrible.  No, there's no way.  How, uh, how does the voting work?  Not that you're asking for votes, but how does it, I don't even know how it works.  Well, Monday, they'll give a number off.  If you watch the show, yeah, if people tune in to watch it, they'll see, they'll give out a phone number for each of the comedians. 
[03:17:00]  And you vote for who you want to win.  And yeah, that's it.  That sounds pretty fair.  Yeah, no, it's, it's, look, it's all, it seems like it's on the up and up.  And, uh, if I win, it'll be the, it'll be a great show.  If I lose, then it's a scam.  No, fuck all that.  Are you getting recognized like crazy for the show?  Absolutely, yeah.  It's been insane.  Yeah, it's been crazy.  And people, you know, I'm trying to keep as much of my real fucking voice on NBC as far as you can.  You know, um, and I think I'm doing a good job.  I hope I am. 
[03:17:30]  I hope people aren't seeing, you know.  Oh, you know, take the wig.  Bravo.  I was going to bring this up.  But, uh, what I hate about Last Comic Standing is where they're, they're, they're, they're, um, uh, oh boy, I'm having a rough day.  I got to get some fucking sleep.  They're, they're putting people into categories.  You got to have the black comic.  You have to have kind of the Dane Cook guy.  You got to kind of have the, the female comic and you know what I mean?  The gay comic.  Yeah.  It's like, why not just have all these guys audition and just fucking pick the funniest guys.  Fuck categories. 
[03:18:00]  They're like auditioning for each, each spot.  Yeah, exactly.  If you're going to have a true competition.  That's the network though.  That's it.  Yeah, I know.  That's always been frustrating to me.  Yeah, it's annoying.  I think we'll watch anyway if you got, you know, at this point, 10 just really funny guys and they're not in categories.  Watching the entire process, I feel like they picked, you know, the best they could.  Like the, the two colored fellas that are on it are probably among the best of the, uh, colored fellas.  I'm bringing that back, by the way. 
[03:18:30]  We're, we're trying for Jigaboo ourselves.  Yeah, no, I've had people call me like my friends from the neighborhood.  Like I still got old friends that are like, hey Mike, this fucker Moulin Yama, he doesn't have to say your name.  That's what they call, you know, I got 10 messages because Craig Robinson says my name wrong.  What did he say, DiStefano?  Yeah, something like that.  DiFasano, whatever.  Like Craig is a funny guy, but he doesn't really add much to the show.  Well, he's not doing stand-up.  You're going to hear me throwing off the show.  You guys are just going to bait me into fucking, yeah, Craig Robinson's a piece of shit. 
[03:19:00]  I'm not saying he's a piece of shit.  No, I know.  No, he's great to shit.  But he doesn't really do it much.  Yeah, I don't know what he's supposed to be doing.  I'm pretty much just enjoying you guys.  That's it.  Opie, I'm here for you to help me win the contest, not get thrown off the goddamn thing.  Well, you don't listen to the show often, do you?  Yeah, I know.  We're setting you up for the big fall, I got you.  Mike won't ask you to vote for him, but I would encourage.  Of course.  I like Lori, too.  She's my friend.  But Mike's a good comic, man.  Thank you.  I don't know who else is even on at this point.  I haven't watched, I never watched anything with comedy. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, you wouldn't know any of them, to be honest.  Okay.  I don't think so.  I would hope to do.  Yeah, you and Lori are the only two I know.  Rachel Feinstein.  I like Rachel.  Yeah, Rachel's a New York girl.  I like Rachel.  Yeah.  I don't think I know Rachel.  Lori, if Lori won, man, it wouldn't bother me a bit.  I have so much love.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's phenomenal.  I think she's a great writer.  She's very funny.  Yeah, she's got balls.  She's got a lot of balls and, you know.  So getting recognized, though, huh?  Yeah, but getting a lot of recognition, it's good, you know?  From here on out, this is going to help you. 
[03:20:00]  It doesn't matter.  That's right.  If you win, great.  But if you don't win, it doesn't matter.  It's already a win for Mike.  You're not going to get more recognition from winning and not winning.  I agree.  You're already in the final.  You were the third guy.  No one gives a shit.  You're doing good.  But anyway, I think the top five do a little tour, so that could be some nice money for Mike.  Yeah, the top five.  So he gets to the top five, then it's great.  Yeah, we go on tour, and then if I win, you know, that's a good down payment on a little  house near Anthony out in Long Island.  Yeah, that's right.  Come out, live by Anthony.  You want to do a Long Island?  Get a real Italian fucking neighborhood going out there, you know what I mean?  Yeah, exactly.  He's in a Jew neighborhood. 
[03:20:30]  That's all right.  That's what I'm saying.  The Jews are the same.  The only difference between Jews and Italians is college.  That's the difference.  They went to college.  We robbed from them.  Who gives a shit?  Oh, wee.  You did the addiction show, too.  Yeah, man.  You and Jimmy, right?  Yeah, Jimmy.  Voss and Kelly.  I am looking forward to that so much.  Comedy Central?  Comedy Central.  Down the road?  In the fall, it's going to come out.  You know, I guess they're going to try to take whatever popularity I get from last comic  coupled with Jimmy. 
[03:21:00]  You know, then it'll be a bigger deal.  We've got a DVD coming out of the show.  We're working on that now, getting a deal.  Were you guys happy with the show?  I was very happy with it.  Jimmy, you were happy with it?  Yeah.  As much as I can like my set, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Jimmy did great.  I mean, he was phenomenal, of course.  And it was all good.  You know, we'll see.  Still clean?  No, no.  I relapsed after I got the money for that show.  When they paid me for that show, I finally had enough money for rehab.  That's the only reason I stay clean.  It's like, not because I can't afford drugs.  I can't afford getting off them.  How many years now? 
[03:21:30]  12 years.  Yesterday.  Yesterday.  My 12-year, thank you.  Yeah.  Does it get tough?  No.  I don't, you know, I don't have a problem with wanting to get high at all.  You never get the itch?  I don't.  I mean, I think because I do so much, like, prostitution stuff.  And no, I do.  I feed every addiction that I have other than drugs that I just, I never feel craving for.  You're a prostitute guy.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But no, I'm a decent looking guy. 
[03:22:00]  You could have a girlfriend.  Why not?  He looks like a guy who gets whores, though.  You look like a whore.  Jesus.  No, no, look, I do have, I have beautiful women that want to be intimately involved with  me, but I'd rather pay a chick 20 bucks to suck my dick and go away.  People laugh.  What do you pay for hookers?  You want a $500 hooker, they're just, ew, they're too clean, and I want them, you know,  dirty.  Need a little skank.  I like them filthy.  I do.  A little dirt.  Yeah.  It's just, it's awful. 
[03:22:30]  Sometimes, you know, those other ones are, you know, I'd rather, if a $500, you better  hold me and tell me it's going to be okay, and my childhood was your fault, or whatever,  something to do some healing.  I like a good dirty one, too.  Yeah.  Come on.  I like a good dirty one.  Not $20 worth, but I mean, I like someone.  What's your low limit?  Now, at this point, it would probably be like $152, because of, you know, again, the times.  Years ago, it was $20, though.  Yeah.  $20.  You can't get someone to come over for that kind of money.  What's the most you've ever paid and not been disappointed? 
[03:23:00]  I've not been disappointed.  Most I've ever paid is $600.  That was going to be my answer.  And you weren't disappointed?  It was more the person I was fucking as opposed to the actual fucking.  It was like, I can't believe I got her to do this.  Oh, that's a very interesting way to put that.  Yeah, they were people I already knew.  Uh-huh.  They were not prostitutes.  Wow.  And, you know. 
[03:23:30]  They were that night.  Yeah, but in a way, but it was, yeah, $600 was my maximum.  Yeah.  I think so, yeah.  $20, me.  That's the highest I've ever won.  $20.  Mike is smarter.  Yeah.  I mean, that's 30 fucking loads I could have got out.  Exactly.  For my one moment.  Load for load.  Yeah.  Basically, I paid $600 to come and go, take that, you. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, I can't.  Good.  Yeah, $20.  Yeah.  Wow.  I got to break in.  Mel Gibson, tape number four in my hand.  The way.  A new one?  A new one.  We did tape number three earlier.  We got the.  This just hit?  This is hot.  We got to hear it.  We have to.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to hear this.  Absolutely got to hear this.  And, by the way, don't win the contest.  Okay.  Fuck it up and come in second.  Okay.  Two words.  Dat fan.  Right. 
[03:24:30]  Do not win this fucking thing, Mike.  Trust me on this.  All right.  I'm going to do my best.  Take it as far as you can and then blow up your spot at the end.  Okay.  Don't win this fucking thing.  Yep.  Win it.  All right.  Why?  Will they give you the first one?  I'll tell you why.  There's been a few bombs in there.  Dat fan wasn't looked at as a legitimate comic by comedians.  Mike is.  So, if Mike won it, it would actually legitimize.  Not that it's not legitimate now, because some good acts have won it.  All right.  Dave Mordell was a funny guy.  Did Mordell win?  I don't think he won, no.  John Heffron.  Heffron's a funny guy.  Heffron's good.  Heffron's funny. 
[03:25:00]  Alonzo Bowden's a funny guy.  He's funny.  Who won in...  Dat fan won.  Who won season two?  I don't know.  It might have been...  I think that was Heffron.  Yeah, John.  Heffron.  But there's some good acts that have won.  So, you think you should win it?  Yeah.  Maybe you should win it, because you're not doing that house shit.  Yeah.  So, maybe there's a little more respect.  Yeah, a little more than just...  Yeah, yeah.  It's based on comedy and not...  All right.  I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.  I might go to win it.  I might try to win.  But you know what?  If you don't win it, just go, you know what?  I didn't want to win it.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm going to say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  All right. 
[03:25:30]  And then tell them, you know, fuck their contest.  Yeah.  Mel Gibson, tape number four.  You've been following this, Mike?  Yeah, I have, actually.  What's your favorite part so far?  We all have favorite parts.  The cunt.  I like the word cunt.  That is my favorite.  My favorite was when he just yells, smile, and blow me.  Yeah, yeah.  That was good too.  That's fantastic.  I think I like when she goes, I am not the whore.  You are!  You are!  He just blurts it out like a five-year-old.  Yeah, he is six. 
[03:26:00]  Wonderful.  My favorite part is right here.  What?  What?  The fuck is that?  What?  How he says, what?  What?  What?  Oh, Jesus.  Please, more.  All right, here we go.  More Mel.  Mel Gibson, tape number four.  How long is this tape?  Hot off the presses.  Three and a half minutes.  Yes.  We could squeeze this in.  Yes.  Total idea.  What the fuck do you hope you'll accomplish with that?  What are you hoping you'll accomplish with that?  What?  Are you going to pay me back?  If you do that, it's over. 
[03:26:30]  It's over now.  Fuck you.  How dare you act like such a bitch when I'm being so fucking nice?  I did not blame you.  When I'm being so fucking nice.  I'm so nice to you, fucking cunt.  Oh, he is a fucking beautiful, beautiful pile of irony. 
[03:27:00]  Wow, he's a mess.  He's great.  $250,000 if you win the whole thing?  Yeah.  What the fuck am I talking about?  Yeah, I'll take it.  Win this goddamn thing.  Quarter million?  Take their money and run.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's nice.  After manager's fees and taxes, you want about $300 or $400 for yourself.  Yeah.  But it's still great.  Yeah.  But you guys get money for appearing on the show.  You have to.  Very little.  Yeah, it's probably scale.  Really?  Yeah, scale.  Network scale is shit.  But again, the exposure, it really is good for you, man.  He's already won.  It's great for you, man.  You'll get recognized for years from this because you're different.  No, I'm excited.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Back to the tape. 
[03:27:30]  You act like such a bitch when I'm being so fucking nice.  I did not blame you.  You said I was mean.  You were fucking annoyed at me.  For what reason?  What?  I did nothing but be nice to you.  What?  I've done nothing but be nice to you.  I didn't blame you last night.  You're a bloody little bitch this morning, poor.  I wasn't doing anything.  What did I do?  And you said, oh, also, earlier today, you, oh, never mind.  What the fuck were you going to say? 
[03:28:00]  I love Mel Gibson.  Mel doesn't miss a fucking trick.  He is so hurt.  He's the greatest.  Oh, my goodness.  We don't know why he's so hurt.  He's had problems.  Something's wrong with this fellow, like, deeply.  He's disturbed, man.  Yes, I think it fucking pours out of a bottle.  Yeah.  I believe.  Yeah.  That's my guess.  Yeah.  But he's got some fucking problems, man.  Well, what did she do?  We're trying to figure out what was the one thing she did.  No, all that shit. 
[03:28:30]  And then he just came out.  And then he just got fucking annoyed with her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's fucking annoyed with her.  I think he thinks that she, you know, fucked someone else.  He's a whore.  He's just an insecure, fucked up guy.  And he got all this money and all this power in Hollywood.  It means nothing.  In fact, I'd rather not have it so I could make sense of my misery.  This poor bastard's fucked.  It is amazing, though.  Mike makes a great point.  Like, look at Mel.  He's everything a man could want.  He's rich.  He's a great actor.  He's a great director. 
[03:29:00]  He's a fucking bonafide sex symbol.  Yep.  He's a real sex symbol.  Yeah, yeah.  And this, after his entire body of work, is his relationship.  This is what he's ended up.  No fucking cunt.  I'm nice to you.  Yeah.  Well, this is who he is on a deep level.  He's just this insecure, fucking fucked up little kid.  And it's such a failure.  It's such an awful.  Because he's miserable.  No matter what he has, he's just not happy with anything.  That's terrible. 
[03:29:30]  God.  Let's hear more of this fucking mensch.  I love him.  Earlier today, you, oh, never mind.  What the fuck were you going to say?  I wasn't going to say about any earlier today.  It's just, I was going to say about last night.  That's all.  Why?  Because I let you sleep?  That's my fucking mistake.  I should have woke you up and said, fucking blow me, bitch.  All right.  All right.  New favorite part. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm claiming that it's my favorite part.  This motherfucker is a hooch.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, his career should be resurrected.  He's the best.  I should have woke you up and said, fucking blow me, bitch.  Yeah.  Because I let you sleep.  Did any of you guys ever, were any of you ever in this kind of condition?  I literally have.  With a woman?  I have.  Oh, I can relate to this.  That's what we've been saying through this whole thing.  Yeah, I've been where he is.  Maybe not to this level, but certainly, yes. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, definitely a few years ago, I was probably 16 or 17 when I was this fucked up.  But, yeah, he's a good actor.  This is relatable.  Fucking Andrew Dice Gibson.  Yeah.  I should have woke you up and said, blow me.  You bitch.  You bitch.  Little boy blue.  Murta needed the money.  I love you.  I want to marry you.  Freedom, Jacob. 
[03:31:00]  That's amazing.  I never heard him do that.  That's great.  You've never heard that?  No.  That's one of my old favorites.  That's terrific.  Old dice.  Why?  Because I let you sleep?  That's my fucking mistake.  I should have woke you up and said, fucking blow me, bitch.  I should have fucking woken you up and said, blow me.  You would have liked that better, yeah?  You need the goddamn sleep.  We were supposed to go to a jacuzzi, and you said you have to wait for something. 
[03:31:30]  So why did you have to wait?  You said...  You go to the goddamn jacuzzi.  I'm afraid.  It's dark outside.  Fuck it.  I just waited for you.  I waited and waited until I fell asleep, and then...  Waited and waited.  Like two and a half fucking minutes.  You're fucking snoring.  Don't you dare wake.  You're blaming me right now.  Now I'm blaming you.  You went to sleep and didn't blow me.  I don't blame you.  I deserve to be blown. 
[03:32:00]  I'm an Academy Award winner.  Blow me.  You went to sleep and didn't blow me.  I deserve to be blown.  This guy's the best.  Oh, my God.  Holy fuck.  He did not just say that.  Oh, my God.  This is amazing.  This is amazing.  Each fucking tent gets better.  I don't even know what to say.  Each fucking tent gets better.  It's just amazing.  Fucking amazing.  You didn't blow me. 
[03:32:30]  I still don't know what their issue is.  She didn't blow him.  But he's mad because...  She fell asleep.  Didn't you listen to the man?  She went to go in the jacuzzi.  What the fuck don't you understand?  It was two minutes and she didn't blow him.  All this because she didn't go to the jacuzzi by herself.  Oh, my God.  I'm confused, man.  This is fantastic.  Please, can we rehear that one?  I've got to hear that.  Don't you dare wait.  You're blaming me right now.  Now I'm blaming you.  You went to sleep.  I don't blame you. 
[03:33:00]  I deserve to be blown first before the fucking jacuzzi.  All right.  He's fine.  Blowjob first, then jacuzzi.  Not jacuzzi, then blowjob.  A milk fucking Gibson, asshole.  Wow.  Wow.  He...  I swear to you, if I didn't know the business end of this,  I would think these two were pulling the biggest gag on everyone in the fucking country. 
[03:33:30]  Right.  If he wasn't saying shit that was so inflammatory,  I would think this was some kind of amazing joke  that Mel Gibson and this woman are playing on the United States of America.  What was the first line he said before the jacuzzi?  Are you tweeting it, too?  You fell asleep.  I'm tweeting my ass off.  You fell asleep?  Oh, my God.  When you should have been blown.  Well, I'll go back.  You didn't blow me, yeah. 
[03:34:00]  I'll go backwards.  God, is that fantastic?  I'm going to go way back.  Fantastically fucking funny.  Oh, he's the greatest.  I'm going to go way back.  Here we go.  Don't wait.  You said...  You go to that goddamn jacuzzi.  I'm afraid.  It's dark outside.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  I just waited for you.  I waited and waited until I fell asleep, and then...  Waited and waited.  Like two and a half fucking minutes.  You're fucking snoring.  Don't you dare wake.  You're blaming me right now.  Now, I'm blaming you.  You went to sleep. 
[03:34:30]  I don't blame you.  I deserve to be blown first before the fucking jacuzzi.  Okay, I'll burn the goddamn house down, but blow me first.  I'll burn the house down, but blow me first.  All right, wait.  What do we got?  Mel Gibson loves to be blown.  What was it?  You went to sleep?  I did too much now.  All right, wait.  I got to go back.  It's fantastic. 
[03:35:00]  I'll burn the house down.  I'll burn the house down after you blow me.  This is so good.  We're playing this way before anyone else, so I got to get this right.  Blow jobs are a priority for Mel.  Don't you dare wake.  You're blaming me right now.  Now, I'm blaming you.  You went to sleep.  I don't blame you.  I deserve to be blown.  First, before the fucking jacuzzi.  Before the fucking jacuzzi. 
[03:35:30]  That's great.  God, he's the greatest.  Holy shit.  How do you not love this guy?  Unbelievable.  How do you not fucking love this guy?  First.  Oh, God.  The Mel Gibson tapes.  Fuck Nixon.  Fuck the Veloci papers.  The greatest leak ever.  This is better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is better than fucking Pat.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  O'Brien.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:36:00]  Way better than that.  This is fucking entertaining.  Let's slow down a little bit.  The Pat O'Brien was pretty good.  It was good.  Amazing.  But you know what?  Yeah.  This is coming in parts.  It's like fucking Indiana Jones.  This is wonderful.  This is a series.  It's great.  It's called Blow Me, Bitch.  And then blowing down the house down.  You're blaming me right now.  Now I'm blaming you.  You went to sleep.  I don't blame you.  I deserve to be blown first before the fucking jacuzzi. 
[03:36:30]  Until I burn the goddamn house down.  But blow me first.  How dare you?  Not blow me.  How fucking dare you?  You wanted the number of my therapist?  Don't you ever speak to him.  Find your own goddamn therapist.  Uh-oh.  Because you've got problems more than me.  You need medication. 
[03:37:00]  You've got to fucking push my buttons.  And it is not going to work with us.  It's not.  I can't get like this anymore.  Yeah, I'd say it's not going to work out, Mallory.  And you know you're doing it.  And you're a liar.  And you're dishonest.  And you're fucked up.  So you stay the fuck away from me.  Take care of your fucking son.  And I better have my daughter.  I just want my daughter and a maid.  It's a last life fucking trouble they clean up after themselves. 
[03:37:30]  They make your goddamn bed, which you did not.  You don't have to worry about emotional blackmail or any other bullshit that you put me through.  I just need a nice woman to look after my beautiful daughter.  And blow me.  I don't get the fuck out of any.  Please say blow me.  You're a pain in the ass.  You're a pain in my ass.  Stop being that. 
[03:38:00]  You're a pain in my ass.  Oh, my God.  Stop being that.  That is too much.  Stop being that.  Please tell me there's more.  That ends tape four.  We're going to have to wait for tape five, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  This guy is fucked.  Stop being that.  Oh, my God.  You're a pain in my ass.  Stop not blowing me.  I got a question for Jimmy, though.  You think, I don't know, Mel likes blowjobs? 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  You know.  God, this is bizarre.  I'm asking Jimmy.  He doesn't like blowjobs.  No.  Huh.  It's weird.  He's fucking angry.  He's deeply disturbed.  Jesus Christ.  This guy's shot.  He just ruined one of our classic bits.  That's fine.  He's not gay.  Oh, what were you guys doing?  A bit?  We were doing a little bit.  Oh, I missed him.  No, it's fine.  It's the only bitch Jimmy and I do.  That's fine.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.  Look at him.  He's turning red.  Get back to it.  He didn't know.  Yeah, he didn't know.  He loves him. 
[03:39:00]  I'm so upset.  See, the long pause in that.  It's okay.  That mic's not a mic, right?  Yeah, what am I?  I'm just fucking with your mic.  Come on.  I'm on last comic standing.  What do I know?  Dude, tape four.  Best one.  That's great.  Tape two is strong.  Here's what they are.  It was on tape three.  I'm confused because we did tape three and four today.  It's like breaking up the Godfather by commercial breaks.  You can't say what the best one is.  They're all the sum of a part, parts of a sum, whatever it is.  They're all trees in the same beautiful suck my dick bitch forest. 
[03:39:30]  He's the greatest.  A lot of comments coming in.  The blowjob one, the lines in that tape and burning down the house.  Dude, shushi meat from Philly writes, no wonder Mel is pissed.  This crazy Russian bitch is blowing jacuzzis.  Fucking Mel loves his cocksucker.  Yes.  You know what it is?  After being who he is, all he wants to do is just kick back and get that Australian hog serviced. 
[03:40:00]  That's all he wants.  It's Mel Gibson.  Suck his dick.  Jordan organized Mel Gibson's wife's to-do list.  One, blow me.  Two, go to the jacuzzi.  Three, make bed.  Four, go to bed.  Five, wake up and blow me again.  That's what she is supposed to be doing.  That's all he wants.  Right?  That's fantastic tape.  That is some fantastic fucking recording right there.  God, he's great.  Don't be that.  You are a pain in my ass.  A pain in my ass.  He's so fucking incensed, he doesn't know how to even talk. 
[03:40:30]  Don't be that.  He cannot speak properly.  Don't be that.  He's the greatest.  This will go down in history.  Yeah, this man is awesome.  I think this should go down in history as one of the greatest events.  Yes.  For mankind.  It just, you include it in great comedy specials and the moon landing.  Yes.  You put them all in a fucking room.  Way more exciting than the moon landing.  This rivals, you know.  And here it comes over Lakehurst, New Jersey. 
[03:41:00]  The Hindenburg is making its way over to the mooring lines.  And oh, oh, it's bursting in flames.  Oh, this is the worst catastrophe I've ever seen.  Blow me, you fucking cunt.  You fucking cunt.  Blow me.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Tranquility base.  The eagle has landed.  You fucking cunt.  Suck my cock. 
[03:41:30]  Before you step out and say one fucking word about one small step for fucking man, you suck  my fucking dick.  Or I'll just shoot this rocket off and leave you here.  You fucking cunt, Buzz Aldrin.  One small step for man, one giant blowjob for me.  Oh, God.  He is the fucking... 
[03:42:00]  All I want to do is buy Mel Gibson movies.  I am supporting him wholeheartedly.  Completely.  I'm in Mel's corner.  How can anybody concentrate on the racial stuff?  So what he said, nigger.  He's just an angry guy.  It doesn't matter.  He's...  Listen to him.  Yeah.  It's all about the blowjobs anyway.  Yes.  Yes.  It's so great.  You should just fucking smile and blow me.  Because I deserve it. 
[03:42:30]  Isn't that the fucking...  That could be every man's motto.  Exactly.  That's my motto.  Yeah.  Smile and blow me.  I'm getting t-shirts made.  Because I deserve it.  Oh, there will be t-shirts.  Oh, we've got to get a t-shirt of Mel Gibson's face, smile and blow me.  That would be great.  I'm sure it's outdoor.  Yeah.  I guarantee you there is a shirt already available with Mel Gibson's face and these lines.  And you can get it on eatabullet.com.  Oh, you bet.  I jumped in on that one early.  Did you really make that?  You motherfucker.  That's beautiful.  It's being made up, yeah. 
[03:43:00]  That's hysterical.  Smart.  That's beautiful.  Oh, he's the greatest.  He's just the fucking greatest.  God.  Oh, it's beautiful.  You've got to love Mel Gibson.  This is all, by the way, in an argument, this really is all you want to do is scream, just  shut the fuck up and blow me because I deserve it.  Yep.  And that's all I want from you is to suck my dick.  He's really speaking for every guy that's ever been angry about anything. 
[03:43:30]  We're disappointed or just.  We're happy.  Or there's traffic.  Or anything.  I got another one in.  Listen, Lord of the Wasteland humongous.  Take that mohawk faggot on his motorcycle and his little boyfriend and have them suck  each other's fucking cocks.  I saw Rick two days ago that'll haul that tanker.  Call me.  From the Road Warrior. 
[03:44:00]  Thank you.  Thunderdome.  Two men enter.  One man close the other.  Poor bastard.  When's T5 come out?  Tomorrow?  I just.  It's amazing.  Just smile and blow me.  Wow.  It's fantastic.  Whose is that?  Is that Norton?  Don't give him credit. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, no.  No, I don't.  You're not giving anyone credit now.  Oh, no.  I wasn't even going to buy a Just Smile and Blow Me shirt.  It should be off Eat a Bullet.  You go to eatabullet.com.  Yeah.  And you got a picture of Mel on your shirt?  Can you do that?  No, I can't do that.  No.  You get sued for that, Mike.  What's wrong with you?  Is she going to get sued for what she's doing?  Or is this legal?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Sue everyone.  It doesn't seem like it would be legal, but I guess it is.  Smile and suck, my dick.  Man, we make a stupid prank call on the radio.  We got to tell them first now.  Yeah, I know.  And she could just fucking tape Mel Gibson and give it to the world?  Thank God.  It's not fair.  We're doing a prank call to you, so act surprised. 
[03:45:00]  What do you say to them?  That's exactly what you're supposed to do.  Yeah, fuck these people.  So when you hear prank calls on regular radio, it's all bullshit.  He's been punked.  All bullshit.  It's all fake.  Yeah.  All fake.  They took the prank call out of the game for the radio guys.  I'm very proud of you.  I'm very proud of you.  I'm very proud of you.  I do magic act.  Yeah.  Well, it's not going to get better than that.  I'll wrap your head in with a fucking ratchet.  Mikey?  I sell Paul. 
[03:45:30]  By the way, we're going to replay tape four tomorrow because we need to spend some time  with that one.  Yeah.  Beautiful.  I figure we get it out there for you guys.  Beautiful.  We'll go over it more closely tomorrow.  Mike DiStefano.  Mike, I just started following you on Twitter.  It's Mike underscore.  You couldn't get the regular Mike DiStefano?  I didn't really do it.  I don't know.  Are you not doing it?  No, I didn't set it up.  I guess my managers did that.  All right.  Mike underscore DiStefano.  D-E-S-T-E-F-A-N-O on Twitter. 
[03:46:00]  Right.  Follow Mikey.  And, of course, last comic standing, Monday's 9 o'clock Eastern on NBC.  That's right.  Vote for Mike next Monday.  Thank you, man.  They will definitely give a number out.  And, please, push Mikey through.  And we want him to win the thing, because I didn't know it was $250,000.  Holy shit.  That's not bad.  Take the fucking money and run.  Yes.  And you got other gigs coming up?  Yeah.  I'll be out in L.A. next week.  I'm at the Ice House.  Good club.  In Pasadena.  Yeah.  A lot of fun there next Thursday.  And I'm at the Improv in Hollywood on Saturday. 
[03:46:30]  Cool.  So, and I'll be out at Vinny's in August sometime.  Vinny Brand.  But hopefully I'll be back in before then to hang out with you guys a little bit.  Absolutely.  We're going to follow your progress on last comic standing.  Cool, man.  Closely.  So.  Thank you.  I have to whore myself.  Jimmy.  Yes.  April 29, no, I mean July 29, 30, 31, I'll be in the Atlanta Punchline, and my Boneyard  show starts in 25 minutes.  Ooh.  Tick tock.  Today.  Sure it's today?  Today's Wednesday, right?  You always get that wrong. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  I always think it's Tuesday.  No, it's today's Wednesday.  Today's Wednesday, so it's today at 11 to noon.  I'll do the show with you today.  I'm sticking around.  All right.  I'm going to be playing.  I do themes, and the theme is going to be songs that I play when I want my girlfriend  to leave the room.  And blow me!  And blow me.  All right.  Very good.  Yes.  Is that it?  Mike, anything else?  No, man.  Thanks for having me in, guys.  I love you.  Thanks a lot, man.  Oh, Mike's CD, OK Karma.  Yeah, check it out.  Available on iTunes and Amazon. 
[03:47:30]  OK Karma.  You've got to be selling well with the show.  It's got to help.  It's helping.  Yeah, I don't know.  I haven't gotten the numbers yet, but I'll do my best.  Mike, we'll leave with a little stand-up from you.  Mike's audition from Last Comic Standing, week four stand-up, or week six stand-up?  Week four stand-up is Italian Heritage, Meeting Girls, Craig Robinson, mispronouncing your  name, or Self-Esteem, Black Guys, Reincarnation.  That one, I think you'll like.  The second one.  The second one I just did?  I like it better.  All right, so we'll leave you with Mike DiStefano from Last Comic Standing. 
[03:48:00]  Thank you, man.  And we'll see you soon, Mikey.  Thanks.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Oh, wow.  That would have been a great out, too.  Oh.  Take two?  Yeah.  Mike, we're not going to hear you.  You're a stand-up.  Big spot for you, and I don't think it's going to work.  Fuck, man.  Hold on.  Let me try it again.  Oh.  You hear how perfect that owl would have been, too?  Oh, here it is.  Coming to the stage right now is Mike DiStefano. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, what's happening?  All right.  Have you ever noticed that the wrong people have self-esteem?  Right?  Like, I have a friend.  The guy's delusional.  He likes himself, and he shouldn't.  And I tell him, stop liking yourself.  You suck.  He thinks he has what he says.  I got women banging my door down. 
[03:49:00]  I said, from the inside.  You're trying to get out.  He told me, he said, I have a stalker.  I said, well, it's probably a social worker from the STD clinic.  I wouldn't worry.  Look at the black dudes.  They love me, the black man.  I feel like a chubby white girl sometimes.  I really do.  That's right.  I love black dudes.  You see a black guy walking, you hear music in your head. 
[03:49:30]  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I look at a white guy, I think about insurance.  I want to be black.  I want to be reincarnated as a big black man.  That would be fun.  You know, not next life.  I want to be white one more time.  But then after that, I'm going black, son.  I'm going to keep it real. 
[03:50:00]  I'm going to keep it real.  I don't like to do observational humor because I was raised as a kid.  If you observe something, you keep your mouth shut.  Don't say nothing.  I was a drug counselor before I started doing comedy.  It was a good job.  I helped a lot of people.  This one guy once came to me.  He's like, Mike, I don't know what to do.  I had sex with a man for crack cocaine.  And then he said, do you think I'm gay?  I said, I think you're worried about the wrong thing. 
[03:50:30]  I don't know if you're gay, but you definitely have a drug problem.  You need rehab.  You don't need to redecorate.  Thank you very much, you guys.  Thank you. </pre>
