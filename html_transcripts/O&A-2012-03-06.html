<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a fiery debate surrounding Rush Limbaugh's controversial comments about Sandra Fluke and the subsequent backlash. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton vehemently defended Limbaugh's right to free speech, arguing that while his words were offensive, the advertiser pullout and calls for his dismissal were examples of mob mentality and censorship. They contrasted Limbaugh's situation with similar controversies involving other radio personalities like Imus, highlighting what they perceived as hypocrisy and selective outrage in the media's response.  A clip of Imus criticizing Limbaugh was played.  They also heavily criticized Ed Schultz's apology for his own offensive remarks, deeming it insincere.  A caller, Frank, challenged the hosts' stance, prompting a heated exchange regarding the consistency between supporting free speech and advocating for the removal of offensive individuals from their positions. The hosts used examples like Kirk Cameron's views on gay marriage to further illustrate their point.  This discussion, punctuated by frequent expletives, dominated a significant portion of the show.  The segment included the "F.U. Line,"  a satirical "Primetime Sam Roberts" bit featuring a fictional Taylor Swift interview, and a discussion of Walter Cronkite's departure from the CBS Evening News.  Various TV show discussions, clips from *Angel Heart*, and an *Intervention* episode were also interspersed throughout.

The show then transitioned to the hosts' frustrations with celebrities who reneged on appearances, particularly Jonah Hill, Amy Schumer, and Russell Brand, often prioritizing appearances on larger shows like Howard Stern's.  This segued into a discussion of the surprisingly low death rate of professional wrestlers, with the hosts updating their "dead wrestler clock," which was still under 100 days.  They humorously speculated on the causes of wrestler deaths. Pat Robertson's comments on tornadoes were mocked, leading to a broader discussion on free will, God, and faith versus irrefutable truth.  The segment concluded with a long, humorous discussion about the hypothetical scenario of giant ants, referencing previous discussions by Ronnie B and showing a video about ant colony complexity.  Various callers participated in these discussions.  A mention of Brother Wheeze’s Vietnam War tapes was made.

Subsequently, the show played audio tapes from "Brother Wheeze," a Vietnam War veteran, recorded 45 years prior. The tapes graphically detailed his combat experiences, including nighttime ambushes, the use of Claymores and grenades, the killing of enemy soldiers, and the use of their bodies to mark a helicopter landing zone. He contrasted jungle patrol life with base camp life, highlighting the harsher conditions and punishments at base camp.  He also discussed interactions with Vietnamese women, commenting on their availability for sex and the prevalence of deformed children.  The tapes also covered the poor living conditions, C-rations, and the small comforts that boosted morale. The hosts expressed surprise at the language used ("gook," "Charlie," "boom boom") and speculated on why Brother Wheeze had taken the tapes offline.  They noted his seemingly detached perspective on his past experiences.

Following the tapes, professional wrestler Adam "Edge" Copeland joined the show.  Edge discussed his retirement due to spinal stenosis, detailing the physical toll of his career and the dangers of ladder matches, including multiple broken bones and torn muscles. He talked about his career length, financial security, travel, his upcoming Hall of Fame induction, and his relationships with other wrestlers like The Rock and John Cena, including an anecdote about The Rock's flustered use of notes during a promo.  The conversation also touched upon WWE culture, financial aspects, and behind-the-scenes dynamics. The hosts also discussed other wrestlers and speculated on Shane McMahon's departure from the wrestling business.  Another interview segment featured Edge promoting his upcoming comedy shows with Artie Lange, David Tell, and Nick DiPaolo.

After the Edge interview, the show featured discussions on a hypothetical human-versus-giant-ant battle, Lisa Bonet and Christina Hendricks' nudity, and an internal conflict involving interns, particularly Intern Eric's tardiness and alleged negative comments about a staff member (Paul).  This led to discussion of his train-related excuse.  A significant portion focused on a former intern, Harry T, who had previously submitted his own material under a fake name and email address; the hosts played the audio of his submission.  The show concluded with a segment featuring a caller, "AJ Poopy Shits," engaging in an explicit and sexually suggestive conversation with the hosts, filled with offensive language and descriptions of sexual acts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better, yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Because people say Rush would never, um,  sorry, we're starting the show, but we're all fired up.  People are like, well, why are you supporting Rush?  He certainly wouldn't support you guys if you were in trouble.  I don't care.  Is that what it takes?  That's not where I'm at.  Right.  Is that how it works?  You only support the people that support you when you're talking about freedom of speech? 
[00:01:30]  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Great.  Good morning.  Super Tuesday morning.  Good morning, Super Tuesday morning.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Super Tuesday.  Yes.  Uh, sorry.  No, because I'm very surprised that Mr. Imus is not supporting Rush Limbaugh.  Was Mr. Imus doing a character when he didn't support him?  No.  Hell no.  That was Imus.  I mean, you know, I think, I told Ann before the show, radio guys, they're all for themselves. 
[00:02:00]  So, if a guy gets in trouble, for some reason, everyone gets really excited, like, yeah, man, fuck him.  Good.  Get him off the airwaves, because then that makes you a little more powerful.  Gives you an extra fucking market, maybe.  Yeah, exactly.  But my thought would be that it hurts everybody, and that you have to support these guys no matter what, you know?  I was saying on Twitter yesterday, I don't even necessarily like Rush Limbaugh or his show.  But I certainly would support him to be able to say whatever the hell he wants on his radio show, as long as it's within FCC guidelines. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, I don't care what he fucking talks about.  But people are like, no, this sexist pig needs to be taken off the air.  Oh, now he's a sexist pig because of one thing?  Yeah.  Or is it a few things?  Or is it what?  He spends his entire show going after women?  I don't think so.  And how about the fact that do you listen to his show on a daily basis?  Probably not.  Then why the fuck do you care if it's on or not on? 
[00:03:00]  Exactly.  Let the people that do listen to it listen to it.  People are so willing to just take away other people's shit.  Right.  You know?  Oh, I enjoy listening to them on the way in.  Right.  Oh, you do?  Right.  Well, not anymore, because I don't think it's appropriate.  Do you listen?  No, but...  Right.  Shut the fuck up.  I tweeted that there's a big difference between being offended and, and the N was in capital  letters, and being offended and wanting a show taken off the air for no one else to enjoy. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  There's a big difference there.  You're absolutely allowed to be offended by what we say, what Rush says, what Imus says,  or Howard says.  Absolutely, or absolutely could be offended by what you hear.  People want him gone.  But then you want, because you're offended, you don't want anyone else to hear that particular  show.  That's crazy talk.  Crazy talk.  They want him gone, dude.  They've wanted him gone for so long.  I understand that.  Yeah.  Fucking gunning.  This is just the chant. 
[00:04:00]  It's like, it's like when the star athlete fucking pulls his Achilles, everybody's just  jumping on him.  That's all it is.  Of course, but there's people that do enjoy the show, and it will affect other broadcasters  if he goes, and that's why this is extremely important.  And people are like, well, it's a free market society.  You could tell I was fucking dealing with this all night yesterday.  But what the hell?  I like the debate I had on Twitter where they're like, it's a free market society, and yeah,  he has the right to say what he did, but then the advertisers have the right to pull out. 
[00:04:30]  The advertisers are feeling the heat, and made a good point before the show, that these  advertisers absolutely do not want to pull out of Rush Limbaugh, just about every single  one of them, if you sat them down behind closed doors.  There's no morality or ethics that are keeping them from staying on a show.  That has nothing to do with it.  They panic, and it's not the community standards.  It's not the public, the marketplace that's dictating.  That's what people have to understand. 
[00:05:00]  It's like, well, the consequences are saying that, the marketplace will speak.  No, a minority, a small fucking nothing of the marketplace will speak very loudly and  scare the living shit out of advertisers using mob tactics, using mob tactics to completely  take away the freedom of speech, to take away the freedom to let other people listen to  something.  And again, technically, yes, it's the station, it's their station, it's a private enterprise. 
[00:05:30]  It's not like you just have a soapbox on a corner and you're spewing your fucking whatever.  So technically, yeah, there is this accountability that goes with what you say.  But he's not inciting riots.  He's not, he really isn't slandering anybody.  This is him talking about, and the way he presented it was fine.  He said, hey, she's asking for money so she could have sex. 
[00:06:00]  Now, I know when people ask for money for sex, that's called prostitution.  Right.  She's a slut because she's, that's how he presented it.  Right.  It was very, it was done in a very theatrical way.  Sure.  It wasn't as if they were sitting together at a movie theater or a library or something.  He walked up, pointed his finger at her and said, you slut.  Right.  You slut. 
[00:06:30]  But that's how it's being portrayed on TV now.  Because no one saw or heard the clip.  Of course.  It's the way the news portrays it.  Of course.  Once again, no one actually heard the show that day.  So you get these idiots that go, rush that bully, call that nice girl a slut.  No, not really.  He was painting a picture about a woman that's asking for money so she could then have sex with birth control.  Well, and, and making the analogy that if you ask for money for sex in any way, shape or form, you're a prostitute. 
[00:07:00]  Many guys in the entertainment field or just sitting around with their friends in a bar have brought up the fact that if a woman won't have sex with you unless you take her out to a nice dinner and have a date where you get her something and treat her and spend some of your money.  They, they, they've speculated that that's prostitution.  Now, was that literally calling the girl a prostitute?  No.  But, but the, the, the media has jumped on this in a way that now history will always say and present it in a way that Rush Limbaugh walked up to a girl and pointed at this poor girl. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  And called her a slut and a prostitute and that's now what really happened because that's the way it's been presented.  And AOL pulled out their advertising because let's be honest, Arianna Huffington and the Huffington Post is a huge part of AOL.  Politically motivated, yeah.  And she obviously does not like Rush.  She's very, very far left.  Well, then why did they, why was she part of the advertising to begin with? 
[00:08:00]  They had probably, I'm guessing they had already had a long-term relationship.  I'm going to, I'm going to assume they were already there.  Yeah.  When, by the time, I think they've only been there for a year and a half or two years and they probably had a longstanding, you know, and this is a chance to get them.  And Obama calling her, which, you know, Rush raised a great point about Bill Maher.  Hey, look.  Right.  I mean, Bill is a comic.  He should be able to say what he wants.  But he called Sarah Palin a cunt.  Yeah.  And a stupid twat.  And why isn't Obama, and I know she's a public figure in Sandra Flux, I get the difference.  Right.  But look at the barbarity of that language compared to what Rush said. 
[00:08:30]  How come Obama wasn't calling Palin?  Get on the phone.  Come on.  Obama should stay the fuck out of it, first of all.  But if he is going to get in it, he should say, look, Rush has the right to say whatever the fuck he wants in this country.  You might not like what he says, but he has the right to say it.  Wouldn't you love the president or any politician to do that?  That's exactly what he should say.  Absolutely.  That's exactly what Obama should say.  But Rush has been the lapdog for the right, so it's political.  Of course it's political.  But do you know what a fucking breaking of the conventional lines would be? 
[00:09:00]  If Obama came out and said, look, I don't like what Rush Limbaugh said, I think it's rude.  Right.  It's inappropriate.  It's nasty.  Right.  But in this country, the price you pay is people say things that are rude and nasty.  He had a great opportunity, but that's a scary place to go, obviously.  Because it's real forward progressive thinking, not this fake shit.  That's real talk.  That's real talk.  So, yeah, I guess in this free market society, advertisers have decided they don't want to be on Rush's show anymore. 
[00:09:30]  But like Ant made the point, they're feeling the heat and the pressure.  That's all that's about.  These guys are fucking – we deal – I've got to be careful.  We deal with advertisers.  Trust me.  Yeah.  They're whores.  They want their product on these type of shows.  And they're wimps.  They can't fucking stand up for two seconds to back somebody.  Kind of wimpy, right?  They can't for a second back anybody.  They pull out.  Ah!  The one thing I would say, maybe even our show, I don't know. 
[00:10:00]  If you really like a radio show, the audience has got to get together.  They have to finally organize.  Yeah, they never do, though.  They never do, but the problem is they got to – or whatever show you really like, whether it's ours, Howard, Imus, fucking Rush, they're going to take that show away because no one pushes back.  The audience doesn't have a voice to push back because they're like – I think you said it a long time ago.  It's like kicking an anthill. 
[00:10:30]  Like when we got in trouble over the years, God bless our listeners because they wanted to organize.  They didn't know how.  So when we got fired or got in crazy trouble, our listeners to this day always did the right thing as best they could.  But I think I had the analogy.  It's like kicking an anthill.  There's our listeners.  Like, okay, we got to do – what do we do first?  And there's no way to put the anthill back together.  But somehow I think if we're going to survive, the listeners of these radio shows have got to get together and show that they're a force too. 
[00:11:00]  And if an AOL or something is going to yank out of the program, then you could go and say, well, fuck that.  We're all yanking out of AOL.  Yes.  That's the only way this is going to work because these assholes on Twitter, they drove me nuts.  Free market society.  And me and you and Jimmy, we all know we've been through this.  It's a minority that is speaking up and scaring the shit out of these advertisers, unfortunately, and scaring the shit out of the radio company itself.  If you literally were able to get a hold of the free market that was listening to Rush, you would realize that it is such a small percentage of people that are offended to the point that they want them off the air. 
[00:11:30]  You can't even – it wouldn't even register.  That's how small a portion of the actual listeners are.  Now you get the people that never heard the show.  They hear the news account and want him off the air for some reason.  And it's not a free market.  That's a really weird line people watch.  Yep.  They love saying it. 
[00:12:00]  Well, it's easy.  That's what they go with always.  And it beats the option, which is we want you gone because we don't like what you said.  Don't like what you're saying.  When you're supposed to have freedom of speech, I understand he's not being thrown in jail for what he's saying.  But you're not supposed to lose your job when you don't break the rules.  The rules are the FCC.  That's why the FCC is there.  The government already says, here's what you can't say.  Yeah.  He was saying what he wanted to say.  His opinion was being heard.  People liked it.  His advertising – the only – a free market society is if his ratings drop and they fire him. 
[00:12:30]  That's a free market society because no one's listening.  Of course.  Why would we advertise here?  Of course.  That's free market.  But why don't they wait and see how the next rating book plays out?  Right.  If they're right, if these advertisers are right, maybe his ratings will drop.  People in droves will run away from his show.  Advertising numbers go in the toilet.  That's free market society.  This pressure is not that.  That's a pure free market society.  Right.  That's a lie.  The guys on Twitter are lying.  Of course.  Should you have a threat over your head to lose your fucking job and livelihood based 
[00:13:00]  on the content of what you say that has nothing to do with FCC violations?  No.  No.  And that threat is there.  That's why I say it's mob tactics.  There's a threat.  And a threat should never be put over your head to dictate what you say, your freedom of  speech.  No.  Steven and Ron Konkaba.  Ant, shut up.  He slandered the shit out of a private citizen.  He didn't slander her.  He didn't slander her, first of all.  And second of all.  You're trying to make that one stick, dummy. 
[00:13:30]  And second of all, you're allowed to do that.  And there are ramifications.  She can now turn around and sue him if that's exactly what happened, sir.  He was drawing an analogy between somebody asking for money in order to have sex, whether  it's a prostitute or a slut asking for money for sex or a woman that is in front of Congress  asking for money so that she can have sex.  That's the analogy he was drawing. 
[00:14:00]  He wasn't pointing his finger at her and saying, this woman is a slut.  This woman is a prostitute.  He was saying, if she's asking for money, what do they call that?  That's called prostitution, if you ask me.  If you listen to the fucking clip, you'd realize that.  It's not a slander case.  It absolutely is not.  And her private citizenship is lovely, but when you testify before Congress, you put  yourself in the public eye and you hold yourself up to be criticized or commented on. 
[00:14:30]  It wasn't like she was just minding her own business and Rush found her on the street  somewhere.  So you shut up.  And then this guy says, someone with a wide audience on public radio should not get away  with denigrating women and have continued success.  You can get away with denigrating women.  Of course you can.  Continued success.  That's what these people don't understand.  Of course they can.  And you're a bunch of idiots for wanting this to go away.  Look at regular radio, what that has become.  Yeah, you like it? 
[00:15:00]  Because this started a long fucking time ago, you dummies.  All you have to do, seriously, for the people that don't really understand our point, all  I ask is spend the afternoon today listening to regular radio.  Yeah, go ahead.  Because maybe you haven't in a while.  It is horrendous how bad it's become.  And it's because of this shit.  There's nothing fun and original on it.  No one, including our fellow broadcasters, pushed back when this shit was going down  starting about 10 years ago, by the way.  And now they're finding a way, by the way, to even go after your political guys. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  Never on a political point.  But every one of them, I don't care what side of the fence you're on, is going to say  something that, if you grab it, I guarantee you there's 500 things he said that could  have been grabbed.  This happens to be the one that clicked.  So every one of you people out there with a political show you like, this is what's going  to start to happen.  Right.  They're getting rid of people.  Right, man.  And I was trying, you know, for the people that don't understand, you know, you're all 
[00:16:00]  on Twitter, right, wait till they get to Twitter next, down the road.  Wait.  And you go, oh, that can't possibly happen.  Really?  We come from a place where you're allowed to say whatever the hell you want on the radio  as long as you're stuck within the FCC guidelines.  Yeah.  That's sort of what Twitter is right now, right?  You watch.  And then maybe you'll finally understand what the fuck's going on in this country.  It's unbelievable.  I am so fucking fired up because people are just stupid to just throw their freedoms  away.  They love throwing freedoms away. 
[00:16:30]  I've never seen people loving this.  And it's always because they personally don't like something they heard or saw.  So they're willing to just throw their freedoms away.  It has nothing to do with government guidelines.  A lot of the civil libertarians, like, why don't you just be a little unpredictable and defend  a guy who you genuinely don't like?  No.  Like, really, why don't you just defend this guy's right to say something that, yeah, was  shitty?  They'd sooner defend a rapist that they feel isn't getting the defense that he deserves  in a courtroom, which, you know, that's fine. 
[00:17:00]  That's what they're there for.  Yeah, fine.  But they'd sooner do that than defend Rush for what he said.  Why don't you guys stick up for him?  Even if you hate his guts and you think he's a pig and his show stinks, fair enough.  But why don't you guys for once stick up for somebody who you're doing what the  conservatives do?  You're doing the same thing that you always complain about.  This is the type of thing that, like, say it was some crazy sexual discussion that had  taken place.  That would have been a witch hunt when Bush was in office. 
[00:17:30]  That's what all the fucking liberals complain about.  And you're right.  Jesus, don't do the same fucking thing.  Yeah.  And people get confused.  I'm not a fan of Rush.  I'm not a fan of Rush.  I've never listened to his show.  You're going to have to be.  Never.  As a radio guy, I checked it out.  But it was never my thing, to be honest with you.  I never understood why he got as big as he did.  That's all.  I hate the way he talks.  They did owe him.  Right.  Shut up, fatso.  But I understand how you've got to support this shit.  And, you know, people ask me about Imus.  I'm like, I'm very disappointed that Imus went after him instead of realizing that this 
[00:18:00]  is important.  But, you know, he's his own person.  Fuck.  Yeah.  People are dumb.  They are.  People love throwing their rights away, too.  They just love it.  Because they don't see, they can't see any deeper than, oh, I hate Rush.  Oh, good, good.  I hope he's off the air.  Right.  Really?  Right.  Yeah, really, dude?  Because, you know, who do you listen to?  If they slip up, what do you think?  They're going to get a pass because you like what they say? 
[00:18:30]  No.  Another person that needs to be called out is this fucking blowhard Ed Schultz on MSNBC.  I was watching him last night.  Ed Schultz is a douche.  He's a complete fucking douche.  Ed Schultz is a slut.  Wait, you mean MSNBC is not defending Rush?  That's really shocking.  I know.  I'm not surprised, obviously.  I understand, like, you know, Fox is probably going to mostly support Rush and MSNBC is not,  right?  But my problem with Ed Schultz is he's a fucking radio guy. 
[00:19:00]  That's why I fucking hate that twat.  What's he saying?  Because he should understand this shit.  Like, all right, he, without coming out and completely saying, he wants him gone.  And Ed Schultz called Laura Ingram a slut and had to apologize and all that and grovel.  So he understands how this game is played.  But then he did a whole thing on his show last night, like how what he did is different than  what Rush did because of how he apologized.  But his apology was just as fake and not sincere as Rush's was. 
[00:19:30]  How is Rush's, do we have his on-air apology?  We have explaining his apology on the air.  Okay.  I've never hit the table as much as I have today.  I'm out of my mind.  It's infuriating.  And then people think I'm a Fox guy.  I'm not a Fox guy.  What?  I'm probably moderate to slightly left, you idiots.  You're Foxy.  I am Foxy.  But this Ed Schultz, I'm like, he does a radio show on Sirius XM.  And you want to have radio guy fired?  You're a dope.  You're a stupid fucking dope.  They almost took your show.  You barely survived. 
[00:20:00]  He had a grovel on MSNBC.  They played part of it yesterday.  A nine-minute apology to Laura Ingram because he knew damn well he was in deep fucking trouble.  And now he's bitching about Rush.  Yeah, because he's trying to say it's different because he was sincere.  It's always different.  And blah, blah, blah.  No difference.  It's pretty much the same thing.  None difference.  Yeah, you had a gun at your head.  You said you were sorry, babe.  Right.  But he did with a gun at his head, you fucking fraud.  And Ed, Ed, when you fucking dye your hair, you got to, like, wash your scalp good.  That's all. 
[00:20:30]  You looked like an idiot yesterday.  Can I see Ed Schultz's picture, Sam?  He's got dark hair.  Ed Schultz.  And his fucking scalp is all dark because he dyed his own skin.  Kept the dyeing too long, you idiot.  Ed Schultz.  This is another fucking...  Everybody is so predictable on their opinion.  The left will say this and the right will say this.  That's what drives me nuts.  Dumb country.  Sometimes they got to get together.  I understand you're on a side, but it can't always be like that. 
[00:21:00]  You got to kind of come together every once in a while.  Obama completely disappointing in this whole thing.  Why is Obama...  You know, again...  Shut up.  It has nothing to do with you.  Nothing to do with you.  How about you worry about what's going on in fucking Iran and Israel instead of what's  happening to this fucking stupid Sandra Fluke, who looks like Fan, who used to work for  us.  Look at her face.  She looks like Fan.  I've had enough of her in her Inspector Gadget face.  Well, he knows he can pick up...  Teeny mouth.  He knows he can pick up a few of the women's votes out there. 
[00:21:30]  He's already got the women's votes.  Already got them.  Oh, maybe it wouldn't hurt to get a few more is probably what he's thinking.  And to the women out there, I'm sorry.  You know, we support women issues on this show, but you got to wake up.  I love fucking without a bag.  Good.  Get on the birth control.  Absolutely.  Is this the Ed Schultz apology?  No, this is what he played yesterday.  Let me see.  Start over.  This will drive you nuts.  And, you know, not surprising, but what puts it over the top for me is another radio guy. 
[00:22:00]  I'm not going to wait for apologies from the left ever.  And you shouldn't either.  They won't come.  Don't expect apologies.  They're never going to apologize to you or to me or any of us.  That's the difference between them and us.  Really?  Rush Limbaugh's trying to defend himself by claiming liberals never apologize?  As usual, he's flat out wrong. 
[00:22:30]  But there are a lot of right-wingers out there comparing Rush Limbaugh's ugly tirade for nine hours against Sandra Fluke  to an inappropriate statement I made for 12 seconds last year about Laura Ingraham.  Nine hours?  First of all, I don't think he went on for nine hours.  It wasn't nine hours, you fucking asshole.  And what's the difference if it's 12 seconds or nine hours, by the way?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll tell you the difference.  I said it for 12 seconds, so it's okay.  He said it for nine hours, so he's bad.  There's a time limit?  That's cool. 
[00:23:00]  Okay, how long can I say bad, horrible thing?  That was my setup, obviously.  It's the same fucking thing at Schultz and Dope.  Well, I only raped her vaginally.  Right.  He raped her anally and orally and vaginally.  And he went back for a second time.  Yeah, blah, blah, blah.  He took longer to come than I did during the rape.  Exactly.  Go ahead.  Right wingers out there comparing Rush Limbaugh's ugly tirade for nine hours against Sandra Flood to an inappropriate statement I made for 12 seconds last year about Laura Ingalls. 
[00:23:30]  Inappropriate statement.  The moral equivalence between me and Rush is not only inaccurate, but it diminishes the outrage.  I'm sorry.  We're going to pause this a lot.  This hypocrite motherfucker.  Oh, he's a cunt.  Because if this twat was being completely honest and fair, he should play what he said about Laura Ingraham right there.  Yeah, there you go.  And let the fucking viewer decide how bad it was.  You notice how he's not going to play the clip because it's going to make him look bad.  And did you hear how he presented what Rush said there? 
[00:24:00]  He goes, Rush's nine-hour tirade bashing this.  And my, you know, my little misstep.  Nine hours.  That is, that's so not true.  No.  He did it for three days.  What, is Rush's show three hours?  I don't even know.  So is that what he's saying?  It's nine hours because of that?  It's not.  It's certainly not.  Just trying to somehow, it's like he knows he's a hypocrite and he's trying to set up why he's not a hypocrite.  Yeah, he's trying to own it.  He's trying to make it about himself.  What a cuck sucker. 
[00:24:30]  This cunt, if you've had him at a bar somewhere, would openly admit to you he'd wish he was Rush Limbaugh as far as, you know, his radio show went.  Go ahead.  Just nature of Limbaugh's prolonged attack on Sandra Flood.  And Limbaugh has completely offered, completely failed to offer an adequate apology.  A statement on a Saturday afternoon, a much lower profile being used.  Pause.  He's sorry.  But he's smart enough to know that it doesn't matter when Rush Limbaugh made his apology or made his statement that the whole fucking world was going to take it and go with it. 
[00:25:00]  So it doesn't matter.  So it doesn't matter if he did it in the middle of the fucking night.  Are you kidding me?  Time or place of an apology matters.  I've seen Rush's apology probably 20 times and I wasn't even searching it out.  It's everywhere.  This guy's got a lot of apology rules and a lot of things that make him different than Rush.  He's in the media.  He's being dishonest.  He knows how the media works now.  If you throw a statement out there when everyone is focused on you, don't worry about it. 
[00:25:30]  Everyone is going to get out there.  It's going to happen.  He's offered up a series of excuses and his so-called apology only came after a bunch of his advertisers cut and run.  Pause that.  That's why everybody apologizes when they're in trouble.  Of course.  When you're a kid and you knock the lamp over, you don't apologize unless your mother goes, who knocked that lamp over?  No, I did.  Sorry.  And did Ed just out of nowhere decide he was going to apologize when he said that? 
[00:26:00]  Of course not.  Or were people saying, hey.  Wait till you hear that.  Yeah.  Because I, see, we have the inside scoop.  We know how this shit works.  And he's lying to his viewers.  Wait till you hear that.  Piece of shit.  Wait till you hear that one.  Station list is going to get short.  Pause that again.  Yeah.  And Jimmy is absolutely right.  No one in the end wants to apologize for anything.  No.  Especially in radio.  A much lower profile being used.  He's offered up a series of excuses. 
[00:26:30]  And his so-called apology only came after a bunch of his advertisers cut and run.  And now the station list is going to get short.  When I made an inappropriate comment last year on my radio show, I took it to a much higher platform.  I went to management here at MSNBC and I said, I've made a mistake.  I need to take myself off the air without pay.  Pause.  Thank you.  Shut up.  Thank you, Ed.  Thank you.  Shut the fuck up.  Thank you.  Management dragged you in. 
[00:27:00]  Thank you.  The reaction I knew you would have.  You fucking had a meeting with management.  How could we fucking quell this?  All right.  Look.  You should take some days off.  Right.  And, you know.  No one is that goody two-shoes on the radio.  Even the idiots that just play jazz songs.  He knew he was in deep fucking trouble.  And he either went to management or management went to them.  And they certainly worked together and said, what can we do?  We got to get.  Yeah.  It's called getting ahead of the story. 
[00:27:30]  We all know.  Damage control.  We got to get ahead of this before it gets out of control.  So what we're going to do is, how about you, you know, take responsibility and you take  yourself off the air?  Oh, that's great.  That's great.  Let's go with that.  He turned the mic off and went, man, I don't like what I just said.  I'm going to take myself off the air.  I shouldn't get paid.  Do you know something?  Isn't he the worst?  What a douche.  Let me tell you something.  I really don't like some of the stuff I said this morning.  I'm taking myself off the air today. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, you know what, Ant?  Yeah.  I think I'm with you.  Can he get my truck?  I'm taking myself off the air and going to bed.  I think I'm with you on that.  And getting paid, of course.  Yes, well, of course.  He won't get paid.  You know how many times we fucked up and they told the media, you know, we took Opie  and Anthony off.  There was a famous one in Boston where we didn't get fired for.  I forgot exactly what it was.  Bruce Mittman sat us down and goes, don't worry, we're paying you, but we need to, like,  you know, calm everyone down.  So go enjoy a few days off, play golf, do whatever you want. 
[00:28:30]  Don't worry, you'll still get paid.  And then the story in the media was, Opie and Anthony, take it off the air and not going  to be paid for the next week.  Happens all the fucking time.  Meanwhile, paid.  Paid, of course.  Every fucking cent.  I got every fucking cent from every company I ever worked for.  Ed Schultz is an idiot.  Dude, this drove me nuts.  Yeah, this is infuriating.  And more because he's a radio guy.  That's why it really kills me.  Obviously, MSNBC is not going to support Rush, which pisses me off because I think everyone  should just fucking jump in and support the guy. 
[00:29:00]  They're so dishonest.  But on top of him working for MSNBC, knowing he's a radio guy drove me almost insane last  night.  And them not supporting him.  But it's the same as Imus not supporting or him not supporting Imus.  It's this fucking, this piranha mentality that people get when one guy who's big is going  down.  And everybody just kind of gathers around and kicks at him and thinks that they're going  one step up.  Right.  Like these dumb, anyone who's happy to see him get thrown off who's a radio guy thinks 
[00:29:30]  that their slot is somehow going to go up a notch because he comes down.  It's not an elevator.  Right.  It doesn't work that way.  He comes down.  It doesn't mean that you shoot up, you dumb motherfuckers.  In this day and age, every radio guy is in deep fucking trouble of this happening to  them.  Why are we the only ones defending these guys who I didn't even listen to?  I didn't like his dumb fucking show.  Sarah Palin.  Shut up.  He annoys me.  He annoys me.  He's a biased fatso.  I guarantee if you spend a few hours, you could probably find quickly a hundred things 
[00:30:00]  that are worse than what he said about this brood.  Yeah, that we've said so far and will continue to say.  Hear, hear.  All right.  Here we go.  Ed Schultz.  While Limbaugh apologized on a website, I apologized on MSNBC, a much bigger platform.  Ah, really?  Pause.  Pause.  Then Rush's website?  Pause.  Come on.  See how dishonest this guy is?  Now, I don't even remember seeing Ed Schultz's apology because guess what?  In the scheme of things, it wasn't as big as the Rush Limbaugh thing.  And Rush Limbaugh apologizing on a website which is now picked up by every media outlet in 
[00:30:30]  the fucking world.  It's on every website, you dope.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think if you take Rush's apology and Ed's apology and see how many people actually heard  and read it, Rush blows his away.  Jesus.  The guy's so dishonest.  He's dishonest.  I would hope he's delusional.  I'm hoping he's delusional.  He's not delusional.  He's dishonest.  He knows this is how he's going to play it.  But does he really think that MSNBC is a giant platform? 
[00:31:00]  Have you looked at the ratings, Ed?  Yeah, I think...  Nobody's watching MSNBC.  It's a joke.  Yeah.  It's a fucking horribly rated network.  Nobody remembers your apology.  No.  Nobody.  I honestly think we have more listeners than he has viewers.  And that's not even saying much.  Nobody watches that shitty network.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Because you just assume, you know, TV shows have more viewers in general than radio shows.  But, you know, I think this little fucking show has more people. 
[00:31:30]  Go ahead.  Yeah.  And where I made the...  And...  I'm sitting at home over the weekend.  And I'm looking at Twitter.  He doesn't even believe what he's saying.  And this is how low it can get.  People having fun in the social world.  Well, you've got to drop Ed, too, because of what he said about Laura Ingraham.  Really?  Yeah.  This is how I handle my apology.  On my radio show yesterday, I used vile and inappropriate language when talking about talk show host Laura Ingraham. 
[00:32:00]  I am deeply sorry, and I apologize.  It was wrong, uncalled for, and I recognize the severity of what I said.  I apologize to you, Laura, and ask for your forgiveness.  It doesn't matter what the circumstances were.  It doesn't matter that it was on radio when I was ad-libbing.  None of that matters.  None of that matters.  Pause right there.  It matters because you brought it up. 
[00:32:30]  That's why you brought it up, fat boy.  Of course it matters.  It doesn't matter that I really didn't mean it, and technically it's not an FCC violation.  That's what he was saying right there.  You fucking twat.  It doesn't matter that I was ad-libbing.  You know, hey, screw the fact that, you know, people do this every day.  Right.  He's sucking the man's asshole.  He is a cunt.  The man being fucking the greater fucking being of this media world. 
[00:33:00]  And no one just does shit.  No one just does this.  What happened that made him get on the airwaves and do this?  If there was nobody saying anything like calling for an apology, he would never apologize out of the kindness of his heart.  He was scared.  He heard the footsteps coming for him.  Yep.  Well, he put himself in bed without supper.  That's all it is.  He put himself in bed without supper because he heard the footsteps.  And that's why he's been through it.  That's why he should, you know, step up and go.  Obviously, MSNBC wouldn't allow it. 
[00:33:30]  You know, he's not his own person on there.  No.  Obviously.  He doesn't even know who the fuck he is.  What matters is, is what I said was terribly vile and not of the standards that I or any other person should adhere to.  I stand before you tonight to take full responsibility for what I said and how I said it.  And I am deeply sorry.  And the only way that I can prove my sincerity in all of this is if I never use those words again. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, I'll never do it again.  That was a good one.  I'm so glad you guys are enjoying this.  Oh, my God.  And I will say to myself in the mirror, be nice to Laura Ingram before I go to work.  What a fucking self, Ed.  What a fucking pussy.  Oh, what a fucking pussy.  That's disgusting.  Oh, you fucking shitbagging.  And I vow to never use those words again. 
[00:34:30]  Fucking.  Go ahead.  Tonight, you have my word that I won't.  What word?  Fake groveling asshole.  Very sorry.  Are you?  And to this day, I haven't.  That went on for nine minutes.  I just played to you a short clip of it.  This weekend, Laura Ingram tweeted she was still waiting for President Obama's call because of a comment that I made a year ago.  Well, she got a call from me.  She accepted my apology on Fox News. 
[00:35:00]  And we moved on.  I did restitution.  I was off the air for a week.  Now she's using it as an attack on President Obama.  Once again, the right wing is making a false comparison between myself and Rush Limbaugh.  It's the same thing.  It's the exact same thing.  What false comparison.  But this is a great example.  Didn't both use the word slut?  Yes.  This is how people think.  Yeah.  What I did is different than you.  Right.  What I did is forgivable.  Right.  Defendable and acceptable.  And what you did is not. 
[00:35:30]  Because the way I handled it was brilliant.  So why?  Because Rush didn't do the fake groveling apology.  Rush's apology was kind of more real.  He didn't want to do it, but he could hear it in his voice.  This was practice.  This guy practices apology.  You can see.  Said that apology went off on nine agonizing minutes.  He might have went to an acting coach even.  Yeah.  It's so obvious he practiced that shit and how he was going to do it on camera.  Oh, my God. 
[00:36:00]  What a fraud.  Finish the clip off.  But this is a perfect example.  And they do it on the right, too.  It's like nobody just admits, yeah, that we shouldn't.  I don't like what he said, and that's the end of it.  Let him say it.  He's got the right to say it.  I refresh my memory, but when Imus went down, right, I don't think Fox, you know.  Oh, they supported Imus, I think.  I know Hannity did.  Sure.  Hannity absolutely did.  But he's different because Hannity is a guy that will support no matter what.  That's what I have always liked about the guy.  I don't agree with him politically, but, you know, he supports all these guys when they get in trouble. 
[00:36:30]  He gets it.  He gets the big picture.  And Imus.  What about the rest of them now?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  But I think, again, there was also a racial element there, which Fox is no better than MSNBC when it comes to race.  They are as groveling and as frightened of being accused of being racist as any other network.  They're all the same with that one.  Fair enough.  Terrible.  Finish that Schultz clip.  The statement said he sincerely apologized to Sandra Fluck. 
[00:37:00]  A sincere apology is unequivocal and accepts complete responsibility for the offense.  Mr. Limbaugh, we are still waiting for you to take personal responsibility for your actors.  We are still waiting.  But we all know you don't have the character to do it.  Oh, but you do?  Yeah, exactly.  You're so full of character?  Exactly.  Fuck you.  What a douche.  That's everything.  You guys would love that clip.  And we'll jump in and go, well, here's why Ed Schultz is different. 
[00:37:30]  He's the same thing.  He did something scumbaggish.  He had to apologize.  He was going to get in trouble.  He was afraid.  Rush does it.  But here's why Rush should get in trouble and I shouldn't have.  Yeah.  Isn't that amazing?  But it's so, unfortunately, it's so predictable.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is, Jim.  I hate the fact that he believes this.  Well, this is different and I'll tell you why.  What he explained to me was the same situation.  Thank you.  We defend every radio show.  Black guys that get in trouble, the Latin guys that got in trouble, the conservatives. 
[00:38:00]  All of them we stick up for.  And I don't listen to almost any of their shows.  Yeah, there's some shows.  You know, I like to see them get in trouble because I don't like them personally.  But in the end, I support their right to say shit.  You keep hoping that someday, that one day will come where it all kind of lines up and  you can have everyone in a room and make the argument and then everyone can see your  point.  It just doesn't happen.  No, no, it doesn't.  Political talk is really hot right now on regular radio.  It's all about political talk and sports talk.  And this will affect how a shitload of shows do their show. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Do people understand that?  No.  They don't.  More guys getting in trouble.  Now it's Rush.  It's the, this guy said this on the radio.  It's fucking the Jeremy Lin comment.  There is so much thought policing going on and nobody, none of these guys are violating  what the FCC has put in place.  None.  None of them.  So is that what the free market society says?  That all of a sudden, all of these guys are saying things that are so horrible and 
[00:39:00]  the free market is walking away from?  And there's a website, some lady, uh, started get, I forgot exactly what it's called, but  it's, uh, get Rush Limbaugh off the air.  And she was so excited to announce last night that there are over 100,000 signatures already  to get them off the air.  And I'm thinking to myself, I can't imagine you're in your car.  You hear something you don't like and you, you lose your fucking mind and have to start  writing letters and calling advertisers and calling the radio station. 
[00:39:30]  I don't understand the mentality that goes behind that.  I've been offended listening to radio before, but never took that step.  Why would you take that step?  Because they don't care about what he really said.  This is, he's wounded.  This is their chance.  And they're going after him.  That's all it is.  And they won't be honest enough to admit that.  And MSNBC.  But I'm talking about the people that, uh, that aren't, that have any political interest  here.  They still hate him too though.  But you see it on Twitter.  You could tell they're not, you know, politically motivated. 
[00:40:00]  They're just dummies.  They just don't like him.  People just don't like him sometimes because he's like, he's Rush.  He's like the picture of the right wing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It has been for years.  So turn off the fucking station.  I've done it a million fucking times.  MSNBC.  The, the Ed Scholl.  It's amazing to me how he figures out why his apology is better.  And his network hired Sharpton.  It's like you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hypocrisy.  You can't even, there will never come a day where you can, again, sit everybody in  a room and that hypocrisy can just be talked out and everybody goes, oh, that's right. 
[00:40:30]  And I have to realize that because I get so frustrated.  And that day will never come.  I can't even imagine what Sharpton said last night.  I was busy.  I was going to like try to, you know, search that out.  I bet you he didn't defend them.  I can't even imagine.  They pal around and have little chit chats at a table on MSNBC with a guy that said Greek  homos and, and incited riots amongst the Jews and, and blacks.  Tell those Jews, we, what do you say? 
[00:41:00]  We'll get it on.  And those white interlopers in Harlem, uh, Freddie's, which is of course what I believe  was the Freddie, Freddie's fashion mart problem.  Uh, and, and that fire that was set and that guy that died or those people that died, he's  just done nothing but incite people to, uh, fucking misery.  And, and he wants to set the standards for everybody.  He's the, he's an absolute fraud.  That guy, that guy wants.  Right.  And they'll, and they accept him.  Right.  They accept him.  And I know you got to forgive and forget, but where's the forgiving and forgetting coming  on this side, it doesn't happen. 
[00:41:30]  Nope.  Um, moving on, um, you know, pains me to play this next clip, but you got to do it, man.  We're a pretty honest show.  We try to be at least.  Uh, and by the way, DeGro, I'm sorry.  Greg, Greg Weiser.  Sorry.  Uh, be back in an hour.  Hopefully you're finished with the right wing ass kissing.  Is that what this is?  Really?  Dude, do you really believe that?  Like calling out?  Like, I'm even telling you, I don't listen to Rush Limbaugh's show.  I didn't like his show.  This is the exact same break we did when Imus got in trouble. 
[00:42:00]  And Imus certainly is not a right winger.  This is what Imus said.  Kind of disappointing.  I think he's a little gun shy.  I think he, I don't know.  We'll play the clip, I guess, and then we'll discuss it.  This is what Imus said yesterday about Rush Limbaugh.  Of course.  A little commercial.  In the news this morning, seven companies now pulling their advertising from the Rush Limbaugh 
[00:42:30]  radio program after his comments about that Georgetown law student who had been speaking  out about whether birth control should be covered by insurance.  Limbaugh did apologize over the weekend for...  No, I didn't.  First of all, he was a fat, gutless, pill-popping loser.  And to apologize, a lame apology on his website.  Right.  In which he says he didn't mean to personally attack her, is gutless.  A sustained, vile personal attack of this woman over three days. 
[00:43:00]  So if you're unapologized, you have to go sit down with her face to face and say, I'm  sorry.  I'm not going to do it again.  And anything short of that, he's a fat, gutless loser.  And if I'm running a radio session, he's not on it.  He had called this woman, Sandra Fluke.  Until he does that.  Right.  He called her a slut and called her a prostitute on his show last week.  Oh, man.  I was 12th.  It was fourth grade stuff.  Round heels and shall have so much sex you can't want.  I mean, come on. 
[00:43:30]  So seven companies now dropping their advertising.  The seventh was a flower company, Pro Flowers, that has announced it.  As you know, heard on, Limbaugh's show heard on hundreds of radio stations all around the  country, including our flagship station, WAB, in New York.  Also, it's kind of, it's too bad.  What's he talking about?  It's too bad.  He understands this game.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  Why are people obsessed with the politics of Rush during this?  Like, you're the right-wing ass, because, like, why are, I'm not defending his politics 
[00:44:00]  or condemning them.  I don't give a fuck about them.  Yeah, yeah.  Put all that aside.  Why is anybody bringing up his politics in the middle of what's happening right now?  This has nothing to do with what we're talking about.  I'll scream for another day about it.  They still won't get it, because that's what I've been trying to say.  I'll say it again.  I don't really necessarily like Rush or his show.  What do you think went on with Imus there?  It's the same thing that happened to you, Imus. 
[00:44:30]  You didn't want to apologize.  I know.  And then you sat down face-to-face with Reverend Al.  With Reverend Al.  That was embarrassing.  It was.  And, by the way, you had to suck up to his fat fucking ass.  And that's what ruined Imus, was that apology to Reverend Al, because he should have attacked  him.  Right.  That fat motherfucker sat there, and he brought his daughter in.  Right.  And, again, love to see what's on her iPod.  Mm-hmm.  Love to see if there's fucking guys on there that have called women nappy-headed hoes and  bitches. 
[00:45:00]  Come on, Imus.  You didn't handle it well.  Like, you, you, that face-to-face apology sunk you.  Right.  And, and you, and you understand the game like we do, that Rush didn't even want to apologize  for something he said on his program.  He shouldn't have to.  And I'm assuming he shouldn't have to either.  And he shouldn't have to.  And, yeah, of course.  Of course.  Well, everyone's talking about the apology.  Is this new?  I've, did we play this yesterday?  The, uh, Rush Limbaugh explains his apology on the air?  No.  This is new?  I think it's new, right? 
[00:45:30]  Okay.  His apology was on Saturday, so this would have been on his show yesterday.  You can tell by, uh.  Monday.  Monday.  Monday.  You can tell by, uh, Rush's body language that he's like, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's slumped over a little bit.  His voice has a slight quiver in it.  Yep.  Oh, my God.  We've been, we've been there.  But if, if they're smart, they'll stick with him because he's, literally, he's not going  to lose his audience.  The amount of people are not going to go away.  Uh, if he's, if this clear channel is smart, they will stay with him. 
[00:46:00]  If they make the short-sighted, uh, move and get rid of him, it is a dumb fucking move.  Mm-hmm.  It's a dumb move.  I want to explain why I apologized to Sandra Fluke in the statement that was released on  Saturday.  I've read all the theories from all sides.  Let's see if he's honest.  And frankly, they are all wrong.  I don't expect, and I know you don't either, morality, intellectual honesty from the left. 
[00:46:30]  They've demonstrated over and over a willingness to say or do anything to advance their agenda.  It's what they do.  It's what we fight against here every day.  But this is the mistake I made.  Hmm.  In fighting them on this issue last week, I became like them. 
[00:47:00]  Against my own instincts, against my own knowledge, against everything I know to be right and wrong,  I descended to their level.  When I used those two words...  Can you pause this real quick, please?  He's annoying me.  It's like, you know what?  Of course.  Of course.  Stop.  He's making it political.  He's making it fucking political.  Shut up, Rush.  You didn't handle it.  He probably...  Look, from a tactical point of view, he misread the amount of shit that he was going to hear  for this, and he did it... 
[00:47:30]  He kept going after her.  Right.  So I think that's why it just...  You know, like, you keep...  Logan was good at that.  When we got in trouble, and he...  Logan was smart, and he's the one that kept saying, get ahead of the story with the  homeless Charlie thing, and in a weird way, them, XM, as much as I hated them for yanking  the show, that probably saved the show because, all right, here's what's happening.  It's done.  They're pulled for a month.  And there was nowhere else for them to go because there was no new sound clips.  There was no nothing.  The apology was read, and that was it. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  So we had our own thing, but...  He knew how to take care of it, but we're here to tell you that he didn't believe that  we should be off the air or any of that shit.  He just knew, okay, if we do this, we could save the show.  Remember how fun it was going home at nine?  It was great.  We loved it.  At nine o'clock in the morning.  We didn't get punished.  No.  We still got paid to do less radio.  I was eating fruit salad watching Lost by 920 every morning.  I was going to the box set.  We had to make believe, oh, we're not getting paid for months.  We got every fucking penny.  Every penny.  And Logan didn't believe that, you know, that we needed to be punished. 
[00:48:30]  But the way he's trying to say, I stooped to their level.  Yeah, he's making it political, too, of course.  He's just trying to do it in the Rush Limbaugh fashion.  It's like, just, if you got to apologize, all right, you got to apologize, but don't be  a fucking dick about it.  Just go look.  I fucked up, you know, in real terms.  No one is honest anymore.  Don't say fucked up.  When I used those two words to describe Sandra Fluke, that was my error.  I became like them. 
[00:49:00]  And I feel very badly about that.  I've always tried to maintain a very high degree of integrity and independence.  By being high.  On this program.  You hear how dry his mouth is?  Yeah.  Nevertheless, those two words were inappropriate.  He won't even say the words.  He won't even say the words.  Slut!  Prostitute!  Slut!  Prostitute!  He is fucking nervous, dude.  Because he can't believe he's in this position. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  He can't believe that this is happening to him.  He's pretty amazing.  That's why he kept going on for three days, because that's what he's done in the past.  Yeah.  He's like, oh, I'm safe here.  He should be safe there.  Of course.  They were uncalled for.  They distracted from the point that I was actually trying to make.  And I again sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for using those two words to describe her. 
[00:50:00]  Fluke.  I do not think she is either of those two words.  He won't say the words.  His station manager, somebody got to him and said, look, maybe they're probably the head  of Clear Channel.  He probably does it with the head of Clear Channel.  He's got his own network, right?  He's his own boss.  Oh, God, you're right.  The Excellence in Broadcasting Network.  You're right.  He's got, I mean, his partner is pretty much Clear Channel, I would assume, so I'm sure  he's talked to some powerful people.  So he lost a couple, how many stations is he on, though?  He's on a fucking board.  Thousand? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, it's.  He's on a, no.  He's way up there.  Yeah.  How many stations?  I'll double check, but last I heard, he was over 550.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, probably 500 stations.  Holy shit.  That's crazy, man.  But so, but you hear two stations dropped.  You're like, wow, that's huge.  Not really in the scheme of things.  Frank wants in.  Frank in New York.  Oh, Frank wants better.  Frank, what's up, buddy?  Frank.  Yeah.  Hi, Frank.  Go ahead, man.  All right. 
[00:51:00]  First and foremost, like, I don't understand why you guys have such an issue with people  getting outraged and upset by these comments.  You defend the folks' right to say it.  So you defend Russia's right to say it.  You don't agree with it, but you think it's okay for him to say what he wants to say.  But then you get really upset when people get angry about it.  So wouldn't you equally defend their right to get upset?  Yeah.  Yeah, we said that.  You absolutely have a right to be offended. 
[00:51:30]  I don't think you have the right to be offended and then try to take a show off the air because  you don't like it.  That's, I guess, what our point is.  And I really don't, honestly, Frank, I don't believe the offense.  I just don't buy it because it's too arbitrary.  Like, just like Ed Schultz, like, what I did is okay.  What he did is not.  If people were fairly consistent in their morality, I'd buy it, but they're not.  So I just don't believe because these same people were not nearly as outraged, I'm sure,  when Bill Maher was calling Sarah Palin a cunt. 
[00:52:00]  I wasn't offended at what he said, and I'm not offended at what Rush said.  I just don't buy it.  Yeah, but don't you think different people get offended by different things?  Yes.  Because you're not going to get the same level of outrage for every single little thing.  Sure, but I don't, like Opie said, if they're offended, why want something removed just because  you didn't like it?  And I get.  That's the call to action, though.  That's the, that's what, if that's what you want to do when you get upset, then that's  what you do when you get upset.  Okay, that's, I'm sorry.  No, I'm just saying, like, that's just what you, like, that's as good as just doing, 
[00:52:30]  if you don't do anything about it, oh, I'm really pissed, and I don't think you should  have the right to say it, so I'm not going to do anything about it.  I'm just going to let them sit and keep doing what they want.  Yes, Frank, that's what freedom of speech is.  That's what it is.  Great, but that's the same freedom that you have to afford to these people when they get  upset.  They want to say what they want to say, and they want to have action just like anyone  else.  Why would they want action?  This is what I don't get.  Why wouldn't you?  Why wouldn't you?  I'll tell you why.  Yes.  Frank, hold on, Frank.  As a citizen, I've been offended, and I dislike a lot of things that a lot of people say. 
[00:53:00]  A lot of them.  And I don't want them removed from their jobs.  So I hold other people to the same standards that I hold myself to.  But not everyone operates under the same standards that you do.  Okay.  And they don't want complete freedom of speech?  Then let them just say that.  They want freedom of speech that goes hand in hand with their ideological beliefs or their  belief system.  Frank, let me ask you this.  What do you like?  Do you like our radio show?  What's your number one radio show?  Is it us or somebody else? 
[00:53:30]  No, I listen to you guys every morning.  Okay.  Let's say someone didn't like what we said, and they get us kicked off the air.  Are you going to be mad?  Honestly, no.  All right.  I mean, look.  The incident, fairly.  Not to be a dick about it, right?  But you do understand a lot of people will be really fucking pissed off if we get kicked  off the air, right?  Yeah, of course.  And you would be fine with that.  That just amazes me.  No, no, no.  Hang on.  I wouldn't be bummed.  I wouldn't be pissed.  Like, I'm outraged, and I'm going to start complaining. 
[00:54:00]  I'd be like, oh, it sucks.  The show I listen to is up there.  But, oh, well, life goes on.  But you think those people have the right to take the Opie and Anthony show off the air  because they personally were offended?  Yes.  Because they have the same right to do what they need to do.  No, but Frank, okay.  So how about somebody comes out and says, hey, I'm all for gay marriage.  That offends violently.  A giant percent of the population is offended by that concept and that thought. 
[00:54:30]  So if you just come out and state that you're for that, you are offending a lot of people.  So should you be yanked for that, or is it only thing said to be funny?  It depends, Jim, because just like yesterday, you guys were playing the Kirk Cameron clip, right?  And he was asked the question, what's your opinion?  If someone asks you what your opinion is and you offer it, well, you're just offering your opinion  as based on what you were asked.  But if I go around barking arbitrarily that I'm for gay marriage and someone gets pissed off at that, 
[00:55:00]  like I'm making that my platform, well, that's happened.  That's happened.  Oh, you frighten me, dude.  You frighten me because I'll tell you why.  Because listen to all these asterisks you have, asterisks, hard to pluralize,  as to when somebody can say what they want without penalty.  No, I'm not that guy.  I'm not that guy.  But you really are, Frank, and you don't mean to be.  You just explain yourself as that guy.  Frank, you don't mean to be, but you are that guy.  Can you tell me how so?  I don't understand.  I'll tell you.  How so?  You think, when Opie said, are you okay with people taking something off just because people are offended, 
[00:55:30]  you said yes, because you think that that is people doing what they have to do.  A call to action.  You think call to action means I hear something I don't like and I want that person removed?  You're supposed to defend people's right to say things you don't like as long as they're not violating one of those,  I guess, three freedom of speech things, you know, time, place, and manner.  You're supposed to defend people's right to do that whether you like it or what they're saying or not.  Aren't you equally supposed to defend their right to say they want that show off the air? 
[00:56:00]  And then if the management kowtows to those people and takes them off the air, well, then that's what they did.  The question I'm asking, Frank.  Okay, go ahead.  I'm sorry, buddy.  The question I'm asking is why want them off the air?  Look, that's just what they're called.  Look, that's what they want.  That's what they want.  Right?  No, that's not a real answer.  Why?  Do I think that it's maybe an overreaction?  Maybe.  But if that's what they want to do, I can't get in their heads and decide, well, that's why they want them off the air. 
[00:56:30]  Like what was said, they're putting a call and you use them.  All right, all right.  You're saying the same thing over again.  That part of your argument, I don't necessarily disagree, but the problem is there's no way for the audience of a really popular show to organize.  So they're at a disadvantage whenever they get in trouble.  And when I said to Frank, this is why you scare me.  Because when I said to you, if you said you're for gay marriage, that offends a lot of people.  A lot worse.  Like what Rush said is people just jumping on.  But when you say you're for gay marriage, that offends people to their guts, like really like religious conservatives. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  And you said, your answer should have been when I said, should you be in trouble for that?  Never.  Right.  But you actually said and you meant it.  Well, if you're asked your opinion, that's one thing.  But if you make it like you found a reason why it would be okay.  You were the one who, when they played it, you said, well, you can't argue with the guy.  He was asked his opinion.  He didn't offer it, but he was doted into the answer.  Yeah, but he's also not being pulled off. 
[00:57:30]  He's not being pulled off the air.  I was saying, I was actually saying, why would people get mad at a guy for offering his opinion when asked?  If he had a radio show, hold on, Frank.  Oh, my God.  If he had a radio show, I wouldn't say, why was he giving his opinion?  I know he was because it was his radio show and his job.  This was something he was asked out of context with his job and he answered it.  There is a difference.  So there's, okay.  Of course there's a difference between Rush calling a chick a slut and some dude going on a radio show and saying I'm four games. 
[00:58:00]  But he was being, he was being, why is there a difference?  When one is.  Is there a difference?  Because one is fucking slander and the other one is.  No, but what is not, first of all, things said in humor are not slander because Elizabeth Taylor tried to sue Joan.  Okay, you know the answer to this.  Elizabeth Taylor tried to sue Joan Rivers because of all of those things that she used to say on the Tonight Show.  She would blast her.  And what happened was because it said in humor, it's allowable. 
[00:58:30]  And he was not really saying that.  He was making fun of what she said.  She testified something before Congress.  He had a reaction.  Why don't you just admit you don't really like Rush Limbaugh?  I think what Kirk Cameron said is way more offensive.  It's gross.  It's unbelievable.  And way more hurtful.  But guess what?  Kirk Cameron should be able to say whatever the hell he wants on CNN.  And Rush should be able to say whatever the hell he wants on the radio show.  I was way more.  Patrick Harris was a little miffed about what.  What did he say again?  He's Twittered.  He goes, oh, that Kirk Cameron, he's wacky. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Something like that, which was just kind of like, oh, boy, he's a gay basher.  I don't want Kirk Cameron removed from the airwaves because of what he said.  I want him removed because of his horrible religious movies he produces.  And I think what he said was sickening.  Like, we're defending Kirk Cameron, and I hate what he said.  And I don't like him.  I think he's a twat.  Exactly.  I think he's a jerk off to feel that way about gay marriage.  You should be able to debate and have an open discussion about it.  But you shouldn't want these guys completely removed. 
[00:59:30]  I agree.  And you should defend everyone's right to say, I'm a free speech guy, too.  No, you're not.  Oh, my God.  You're not even close to a free speech guy, Frank.  You've got to realize that.  Frank, you're not even close.  It's your show.  Go ahead.  Yeah, it is.  Fuckhead.  Frank, I know you think you are.  And look, I'm not saying you're a Nazi, but I'm listening to you talk.  And what you're saying is really, like, this is how the country thinks.  We're all free speech.  What's that?  Isn't it how the country thinks, unfortunately? 
[01:00:00]  Isn't it?  In a way, here's what it is.  It's my idea of free speech is important if it goes hand in hand with what I think.  And if it doesn't, I will find a reason as to why it's okay to remove it.  And I don't have that for myself.  I hate what Kirk Cameron said, and I want him to suffer no penalty.  That's what free speech is.  Yes.  Great.  But equally, people are going to be pissed off about it, and they're going to do things  to try to get those things removed because they didn't like it.  I'm not saying I agree with that either, but I'm saying you have to equally support. 
[01:00:30]  No, you don't.  No.  I have the right.  Don't support somebody's right to say what they want to say, but then don't support the  backlash of people's right to say what they want to say.  People can say what they want, but they want him to be removed for saying it.  And the people with the loudest voices out there with this Rush thing don't even listen  to his show.  That's the problem.  If Rush listeners had a huge issue with this, they would stop listening.  The ratings would go down, and then the problem would take care of itself.  But it has nothing to do with Rush Limbaugh listeners. 
[01:01:00]  You're trying to make the connection that from Rush saying what he said and us supporting  him is exactly like people trying to get him thrown off the air, and we should support  that.  It doesn't work like that.  Okay.  Then don't support that.  Okay.  So you don't want to support his right to say if you don't support the backlash.  Frank, you're not a free speech guy.  Just stop.  I could support people saying, hey, I'm offended by what Rush said.  I disagree with it wholeheartedly.  I'll support that, but I'm not going to support somebody trying to get him thrown off the 
[01:01:30]  fucking air and lose his job.  That's a threat for your freedom of speech.  That is a threat based on, I don't like what you're saying, so I'm going to take something  from you.  That is not freedom of speech.  And ultimately, you should be pissed off at the management that gives in to the minority  that requests.  Not the people who are looking at it.  You want to be pissed off at them?  That's fine, too.  But then you should be more pissed off at the management that gives in. 
[01:02:00]  We hate when management gives in.  That is, that is.  We hate when sponsors and management give in.  Yes, of course we do.  But I also hate the wormy public because what gets you in trouble changes.  It's a changing ideology in that, again, the gay marriage thing.  Years ago, you could do racial humor.  It wasn't a problem.  Now you can't do it.  Years ago, you could do this.  Now you can't do it.  And what's okay today won't be okay six months from now.  So it just continues to change.  And as special interest groups get more and more powerful, they go under the guise of 
[01:02:30]  being offended to have things they just disagree with removed.  And for you to sit here and make all the things I'm concerned, you mean well, and you're  absolutely not a free speech guy.  Bravo.  I probably didn't.  Yeah, bravo.  No, bravo.  Jimmy explained you perfectly.  You have every right to say what you're saying on our show today, but don't say you're for  freedom of speech because you're absolutely not. 
[01:03:00]  You're not.  So admit that at least.  Why would I admit it if I don't believe it?  Well, I think you're sincere, Frank.  I think you're being honest.  I don't think you're being full of shit.  And I think you really believe that you are.  But I'm just listening to you.  I've had this discussion 500 times because it's what we do for a living.  And it's one of those things where I pay attention to all of it because it affects us  a great deal.  It affects me.  In stand-up, it affects me.  It's like you kind of – that's why we become obsessed with it.  I understand.  I understand why you guys are obsessed.  Believe me, I really do. 
[01:03:30]  And I don't agree with your assessment of me because I probably didn't explain myself.  Okay.  Ultimately, what it comes down to is I honestly don't give a fuck.  You could say whatever you want to say.  I don't give a shit personally.  But if someone wants to get pissed off about it and they want to fucking pick it and protest  and get you thrown off or whatever medium you're on, I don't give a fuck about that  either because ultimately, I still got a fucking life that I got to deal with and build.  I got to fucking pay.  And it doesn't bother me to my core like it does everyone else.  Let me ask you a question.  I'm sorry.  What kind of work do you do?  I'm in IT. 
[01:04:00]  Okay.  I'm trying to think of something that would affect – because again, to people who don't  use – I mean you talk in your job, but for people who don't make their living with it,  it's not as important because like you said, you got to go out and make your living.  But I'm trying to think of something that would affect IT that most of the rest of us  wouldn't give a shit about.  I can't – I know nothing about IT.  God damn.  I couldn't have another job.  Well, I think you'd go with another angle.  What kind of entertainment does Frank enjoy?  And you're fine with people just taking that away from you? 
[01:04:30]  Minstrel shows?  I don't think you're passionate enough about the Opie and Anthony show.  So what else do you like entertainment-wise in your life that you really dig?  Child pornography.  Doing vile stuff.  Scat.  Human sacrifice.  And how would you feel if that was taken away?  I'm not passionate enough about any entertainment that I'd be pissed off if it was taken away.  Okay.  When I say – but hang on. 
[01:05:00]  When I say I wouldn't be pissed off about it, I'm saying I don't give a fuck if it goes  or not because it's just there at the time and it'll be gone eventually and if it's  gone, it's gone.  I'm not going to have this like emotional tie to a show where if it's gone, I'm going  to throw up my arms and start protesting.  Then fucking it's gone.  That's how a lot of people are.  He's passive about his entertainment.  He doesn't give a shit one way or the other.  That's how a lot of people – that's how Howard's audience was.  I mean, a lot of them went to satellite here.  A lot didn't because that's how they see it.  Like, yeah, it was great when it was on but it's not and people got to go home and take 
[01:05:30]  care of their kids.  They don't give a shit.  Right.  That's what it is, Jim.  That's exactly what it is.  I just don't have that tie where I'm that passionate about it.  It's a fucking go.  It's a go.  Like, if you guys were up there tomorrow because some protest group fucking did something  and, you know, they took you up there, oh, well, the fucking show was really  good, man.  That's fair enough.  That's fair enough.  I think people should be able to yell and scream about something they're offended by,  but I don't understand getting it yanked off the air because they are personally offended.  That's the point we're making today.  Free speech is tolerating things you don't like and not wanting them removed. 
[01:06:00]  Like, when you say, why don't I support those people?  Of course they have the right to complain.  I'm not questioning their right to complain.  But when they want something removed and when they target the advertisers and say,  don't put your money here, I don't like what he said, so I won't buy your flowers,  like, that's going way beyond not liking.  That is wanting somebody removed for giving an opinion or making a joke that you find  offensive.  And in my whole life, I have never once had that desire. 
[01:06:30]  So it's one of the few things I really like about myself is that I don't want other people  penalized for what I don't agree with.  And advertisers absolutely have the right to leave these radio shows.  Of course.  Of course.  I agree with you.  I'm not that guy either.  I would never ask for a show to be pulled off of.  I've never actually been offended by anything anyone has ever said in regards to entertainment.  So I agree with you.  But what I'm saying is, if these protesters and these people want, like, that's what  their call is and that's what they want to do, okay, fucking, then go ahead and try it. 
[01:07:00]  Try to get them off the air.  And if management's going to give in and out like a bunch of fucking pussies, then that's  on them.  Well, that's true.  Yeah.  You're absolutely right about that point.  Management ultimately are the ones who fire you, and they are the ones that are despicable  at the end of it.  And that's what we don't understand in this whole thing, and that's why we yell and scream  really loud about it, that fucking management, the companies in general got to stick  by their guys, and these advertisers got to show a little more bravery.  They run away scared by a special interest group, a minority. 
[01:07:30]  Ann said it earlier.  I agree with them.  It's a minority of people getting to the advertisers.  Right.  And then the advertisers get scared and remove their ads.  Look at South Park.  It's a show that has raised a lot of controversy.  There's been death threats because of their jokes about Islam.  And Comedy Central has done the right thing and stuck with them.  And look what's happened.  Nothing.  Right.  It's been a whole bunch of bullshit, a bunch of complaining, a bunch of nonsense.  And that's still an edgy show. 
[01:08:00]  It's still a funny show, and it's still seen as parody because dumb Americans that we are,  only cartoons are where we see real...  We allow South Park to do it because as an idiotic country that we are, we see cartoons  as safe parody.  We're dummy.  We're dumb.  Of course.  We're not bright people.  We think we're a bright nation, but we're not.  We accept it from cartoons.  Because South Park, in the end, probably says a lot worse than Rush's.  Oh, my God.  And they fought tooth and nail, and at this point, you know, they're untouchable, South 
[01:08:30]  Park.  Yeah.  They now laugh when someone tries to go after them.  Like, really?  They don't care.  We've been down this road already.  You're going to lose because we're supporting the show because it brings in huge fucking  ratings.  Yeah.  It's a bigger show.  All right, Frank.  All right.  Frank.  Talk as usual, guys.  Frank.  All right.  Fair enough phone call.  I don't really agree with him, but fair enough.  That's how he thinks.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Wow, we wow, wow, wow.  Mm-hmm.  People, it just amazes me. 
[01:09:00]  I mean, and you start second-guessing yourself.  Like, am I wrong here?  What?  No.  No.  I know what you mean.  Well, you see, like, you're trying to see it from someone else's point of view.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Trying to see their point of view.  But people who get offended, we've dealt with them enough, they are most times showboating.  Most times, there's another motive behind the offense.  They want to use this moment to, like, it's like when a group latches onto you.  It's parasitic.  You want to use the moment to launch into something else. 
[01:09:30]  That's all it is.  You want to use this moment.  It's like if you're mad at your chick for something, and all of a sudden dinner's cold, and you use it to fucking get her to finally give you the blowjob you wanted.  But she wouldn't give you.  Well, you know, it's a terrible example, but that's what it is.  Sandra Fluke would do it for money.  That was my Russian impression.  Unbelievable.  But that's how people think.  And nobody ever wants to admit. 
[01:10:00]  Like, nobody will ever say, like, yeah, you know what?  I am for free speech, kind of, but not completely.  There's always a justification.  Always.  And that's how everybody is.  And it's like that's why you can't win arguments or debates, because everybody feels justified.  Most people like that, right?  Just justified, yeah.  Because it's tough to defend something you're offended by.  It really is.  I get that part of it, but you've got to do it.  Ed Schultz believes what he's saying.  He really believes.  Absolutely.  I mean, he knows he's playing a game. 
[01:10:30]  I do too.  But he also knows.  He thinks that what he did was different than what Imus did, because he handled the apology differently, and he did this differently.  Instead of just, I'm sorry, I'll rush.  Instead of just realizing I said something fucked up, he said something fucked up.  I survived.  He should survive.  Right.  But no, he's got to make it.  Ah, it's different.  Yeah.  This guy should be fired, obviously, because he did, okay, the same thing I did.  But.  And by the way, if the president had called and gotten involved during your story, let's see how you would have handled it. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  That's how this story got kept going, because Obama called this woman.  What is Rush supposed to do?  Grovel and apologize because Obama calls her?  Right.  Which I thought was inappropriate.  Why would the president of the free world waste his time with this dog shit?  It's dog shit in the end.  It's dog shit.  As far as where he sits.  You know, it's been said a lot.  Disagree with what he says, but the defendant's right to say it.  That's what it's about.  Always is.  But for some reason, people don't really understand that. 
[01:11:30]  What?  7-20?  Yeah.  I thought it was 6-0-6.  That went fast.  I know.  Yep.  What did Barbara Walters say?  I see you have that up on the screen.  I'm sure Sandra Fluke was on The View, right?  Yeah, no.  She's now a big star.  Oh, she made the rounds.  Yeah, she's loving it.  There's an argument that she was still private.  And wasn't she, by the way, wasn't she involved in some big birth control movement, and that's why she joined?  I mean, I don't know if that's true, but there's something to her that's more, boy, fucking Breitbart's dead, Rush is in trouble, although the right's taking a few hits. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, taking some hits.  Damn.  I was wondering if Barbara supported Rush or not.  Did Rush support Imus?  Huh?  Did he support?  Someone wrote that he did.  I really don't know, though.  It's just one guy, so I'm not even sure.  One guy said that when we were playing the Imus clip, he was surprised because he said, you know, I believe Rush supported Imus.  He might be confusing him with Hannity.  I don't remember Rush supporting him.  Yeah, I'm not really sure, to be honest with you.  Maybe we can look into that.  He's like, come on, Imus. 
[01:12:30]  What are you doing?  Yeah, that was kind of depressing, right?  People ask, like, oh, now what are you going to say?  Because look what Imus said.  I'm like, look, I'm going to say the exact same thing.  And I'm going to tell you that I'm disappointed in Imus.  Right.  He knows his game, too.  And he's been around longer than us.  And she does not want him to apologize to her person to person.  She won't even probably take his call because she's in a point now, when the president calls you, there's nowhere to go from there.  You're not going to get a better phone call.  So she would almost rather be on the side that is watching Rush swing. 
[01:13:00]  Because I guarantee if Obama didn't call her and a guy of Rush Limbaugh's power called her and said, I'm really sorry, and blah, blah, blah, it would mean something.  But after Obama calls you, no phone call, you get means.  She doesn't even want to call from him, she said.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm not even going to attack the broad.  I don't know anything about her.  I don't care about her either way.  I just know what Rush said was within his rights of what he should be able to say.  She should suck more dick.  That's all I care about.  That's what I say.  You don't want babies?  Don't make me par for suck more dick, fan. 
[01:13:30]  Suck more dick, expect a gadget.  Rush has over 600 stations.  Fan.  Every state.  He's got every state.  More than, and in a lot of cases, more than one fucking station.  Obviously, if it's 600.  Yeah.  Do the math, idiot.  Holy fuck, did I just say that?  I guess that would average over 10 per state.  Yeah.  12 per state.  12 per state.  This guy's on the radio so much, he would live in a little transistor or something, right? 
[01:14:00]  Ah, that doesn't even make sense, Chip.  I think what Rush said is so rude and so inappropriate.  But is it grody?  It's so grody.  You don't like Valley Jim?  I hate Valley Jim.  I don't protect Valley Jim's right to say anything.  You don't enjoy him?  Where freedom of speech ends for me.  You don't enjoy Valley Jim?  Valley Jim.  Oh. 
[01:14:30]  I think Chip should be taken off the air.  We're being honest today.  I don't think that he should have said those things.  I think they were so rude.  And Sandra Fluke should really be upset.  I know I would.  Ugh.  Please fire him.  Why?  I would want some granola and just not to say grody things.  Oh, my God.  Grody things. 
[01:15:00]  What does that even mean in this day and age?  It's just not rad to say that stuff.  Is it not rad to say that stuff?  Oh, boy.  Gag me with a spoon.  Ah, can we eat?  Yeah, we can eat.  Certainly.  We'll get into something different next.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.

[01:17:30]  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we  couldn't get.  Big time music star, pop and country music sensation, Taylor Swift. 
[01:18:00]  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Taylor Swift.  Taylor, do you like grapes?  Absolutely.  Thank you so much for your time.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on the  Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  This is my last podcast as the anchorman of the CBS Evening News. 
[01:18:30]  For me, it's a moment for which I long have planned, but which nevertheless comes with some  sadness.  For almost two decades, after all, we've been meeting like this in the evenings, and I'll  miss that.  But those who have made anything of this departure, I'm afraid, have made too much.  Old anchorman, you see, don't fade away.  They just keep coming back for more.  And that's the way it is.  Friday, March 6th, 1981.  I'll be away on assignment, and Dan Rather will be sitting in here for the next few years.  Good night.  Bar-bar-bar-bar. 
[01:19:00]  And that's Walter Cronkite signing off.  And that's the way it was.  How many years ago?  31 years ago, right?  He signed off 31 years ago?  Yeah, 1981.  Rather took over.  Oh, my God.  And then Rather had a pretty good run.  He didn't...  Did he do his long...  Yeah, he did a lot of years.  Bushes...  Something with the Bush thing brought him down in, like, what, 2005, maybe?  Who, Rather? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was 2006, okay.  Oh, 2005, I think.  Oh, he did 24 years.  Rather went off in 2005.  24 years with Rather.  Dang.  That was when the news was just kind of...  I think the news always had a slant, to be honest with you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's always had a little...  Way more now, obviously.  But back then, you really felt like you were just watching the news.  Yeah.  And then you could kind of form your own opinion.  I kind of like how it is today.  It's flawed, obviously.  But I don't mind that people are fucking giving their opinions alongside the news. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  I don't mind it.  Yeah.  Especially now, because you could just get pure news on the internet.  It does dilute the actual news.  True.  And they know now, we called it newsertainment, and it's all the sponsors, and they've got  to have an agenda.  They've got to make it flashy to sell things.  So you're really not getting the news.  The good thing is, there's plenty of other places to go to get news. 
[01:20:30]  And then people get confused and think, Rush Limbaugh is a news program.  Yeah.  When it's more entertainment than news.  Mm-hmm.  Although he's very powerful.  Yeah.  Politically, obviously.  But it's an entertainment show in the end.  It's an entertainment show.  In the end.  That's what it is.  People, that's when people get confused, too.  It's like, it's an entertainment show.  The guy's not fucking a news guy.  Right.  He's talking about the news.  He's using that as, you know, the outline for his entertainment show. 
[01:21:00]  And I think people get it confused and think, well, a newsman can't say that.  Yeah.  Well, no.  But he's not a newsman.  Right.  You didn't want to go with Cosby today, huh?  There he rocked.  Oh, boy.  Nah.  The other one I was going to do was going to be Rob Reiner.  We have some All in the Family clips.  Rob Reiner, 65.  All right.  Wow.  Cosby went off the air 20 years ago.  Wow.  20 years ago.  We're off the air.  Off the air 20 years ago.  I hate being old.  It's so fucked up. 
[01:21:30]  What was the theme song for Cosby?  I never watched it.  Like, I was not a fan of the show.  E-Rock, you got that one?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, E-Rock.  You know what you were supposed to play there?  The Ropers?  Exactly.  I so thought I was going to hear it.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Well, let's talk about this for a second.  It's terrible.  What kind of style of music is this?  Awful.  Mixed with a little horrible.  But what is it called? 
[01:22:00]  Horror awful?  Yeah.  Awful.  Awful.  There's a few songs like this album.  This is like jazz.  Scat jazz.  Scat.  It is scat.  You don't like this?  Do-ba-da-ba.  Scooby-dooby-dooby-dooby-dooby.  Beep.  And Bill Cosby doing his dumb dance.  This is Bobby McFerrin doing it.  It is, right?  Bobby McFerrin's a slut.  Don't worry, be happy.  I'm just going to call everyone a slut until I get recognition. 
[01:22:30]  I know.  What?  No.  Shut up.  The Cosby Show 20 years ago.  Did you like The Cosby Show?  No, I mean, I recognize it.  I guess it was funny, but I didn't really care.  I like that episode where he dropped the kids off at the pool.  Do you ever see that one?  It's hilarious.  Is that it?  I like that daughter of his.  Which one?  Rudy.  Rudy.  Yeah, well.  Fucking Lisa Bonet.  I used to have a thing for Lisa Bonet.  What about Lisa Bonet?  And I know you don't go black.  No, she was pretty hot, right? 
[01:23:00]  Light, lightish, not crazy features.  Big full lips.  Remember that movie she was in where she was all sweaty and naked?  Yeah.  I don't even remember if the movie was good, but she was ridiculously hot.  Can someone help me?  What was the name of that movie?  Angel Heart.  Angel Heart, right.  Angel Heart.  Yeah, rent Angel Heart if you want to see Lisa Bonet all sweaty and naked.  Keisha Knight.  Yay!  I like Rudy.  Keisha. 
[01:23:30]  Boy, did that spur a billion fucking Keishas.  That was the beginning of the name Keisha.  And all the other ones that are close to the name Keisha.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Letitia.  Keisha.  Carsey Warner.  It's all black people that couldn't dance.  That was very funny.  Oh, man.  You think she was the first Keisha?  Well, she really put that name in the forefront.  You know?  Yeah.  Everyone wanted a little Rudy.  They name it Rudy.  A little Rudy. 
[01:24:00]  Do you have the Fat Albert theme?  That was a fucking good one.  Oh, God.  Hey, hey, hey.  There it is  Yeah  I love this  I'm growing to really like  This theme song  Was that supposed to be 
[01:24:30]  Some kind of sick joke  Yes  We're missing a sound clip  It's just not the same  So  Isn't this great?

Maybe she's all fucked up  And there's always a piece of shit boyfriend  Ever  I've been a junkie for four years  You don't show his face?  I just  Yeah they do  I just started shitting myself up like  Eight months  Nine months ago  Even now  Courtney does not know how to put it in her arm  This might take a while  Hey when like you're using certain spots  And then it stops  She doesn't know how to do it 
[01:40:30]  And she doesn't have any veins anyway anymore  Her arms are awful  Bumps and blood clots  And holes and blood and dried blood  It's great  It's like the scariest thing for me to see  So sexy  Oh  She's bleeding  Ow  Ow  They're showing us shooting up  But she's just horrible at it  She stinks at heroin  She's terrible  Also the needles  She got hepatitis C  Before she was 18 years old 
[01:41:00]  Nice  That's a sexy disease right?  Chronic disease  Literal failure  Death  Her skin doesn't look well  No  Everything hurts her  You can't even hug her  It hurts her  I have taken Courtney to the hospital  Must be a horrible hooker to have over  I know right  Ow  Ow  Ouch  Ouch  Ouch  Ouch  We'll cut it off after this part  But she's at the doctor  Yeah  And she's got infections on her foot  And abscesses  Ew 
[01:41:30]  Let me see your feet  Where's her tootsies?  She lost her little toe  It's terrible  It was really bad  Ew  It was the most pain I've ever been in my entire life  Look Sam  They're pulling the scab off  Like if I had waited a couple more days  I would have lost it  I hate to have a foot fetish  I think the most dangerous part of her addiction  Is the whole lifestyle  Suck on her foot  You just get a mouth full of pus  See a whole heroin tootsies  She's just such a little girl  Yeah  Well she just goes on  To suck dick  Yeah  Jesus  And then they have the intervention 
[01:42:00]  She just walks right the fuck out of it  Doesn't want any part of it  So what was the update?  That she went to treatment for 11 days maybe  I think it was  So she's out there  Checked herself out  Went back to heroin  And hasn't had any contact with her sister or her mother  So now she's a star in Miami  Yeah  She's like  Hey I saw you want an intervention  And she's like  Oh yeah I was on there  It's sad though  It's sad as shit  It is sad  She wanted nothing to do with life  She's young though man  She's 20  It's hard when you're shooting dope before you 
[01:42:30]  I'm just saying that's a long time  But it's not a long time  It's not like a  Well you know what the thing  The sorry part is  She's going to be one ragged ass motherfucker  When she finally quits  You know that  That 20 year old thing  Goes away real fast with heroin  We'll break  That was a good one  Yeah absolutely  I'm going to have to check that one out  We got the Edge coming in today  What?  Is he still wrestling?  Edge is not wrestling  He retired last year  Oh really?  So why is he coming in then? 
[01:43:00]  Well he's going to be in a movie  And he's entering the Hall of Fame this year  Where's Christian?  Fair enough  Christian is still wrestling  Where?  WWE  Oh  Oh yeah  Weren't they partners or something?  They were  But then Edge  After a few injuries  Has this condition  It says it's somewhere on the sheet  But he risks  The doctor said he couldn't wrestle anymore  Without risking permanent  Neck down paralysis  So why don't  So he decided it was a good time  To throw that towel in  But why wouldn't he wrestle  And then just  Everyone understands  Leave his neck alone 
[01:43:30]  Well because sometimes  Well because it's fake  So can't they work around that?  If he's a big star?  Well you could ask  You could ask Edge  I'm going to ask him that  I don't like the fact  That by the way  The prep sheets  Usually have two awful things  But of course it's a wrestler  So Sam has every detail  Right  He drove a blue Nova  In high school  Yes Sam  I got a question  I got a question for Sam  That I want answered  After the break  Have we gone  A hundred days  Without a wrestler dying?  Oh  Sam will answer that next

[01:46:30]  466-969E6- affected  Buy from the  Get your  начина örn  If you want  Chewy  more  E  Just La Henderson  I always wonder what's going on on a radio show and the music is playing for a while.  And then I don't have to with this show because, you know, I'm there.  Same thing that's going on when the music's not playing.  Nothing. 
[01:47:00]  It is odd, though, because if you ever listen to a radio show and the music's going on for a little bit...  You never do?  And you just don't know what's going on.  You're like, why is the music going on so long?  What must be happening in that wacky machine that they work in?  And you know it's some kind of, and you tell them this!  Yeah, you're always thinking it's some kind of drama.  Oh, there absolutely is.  Somebody talking to the equivalent of dumb Roland.  Yeah, true.  Stupid Roland.  Doppelganger Roland at some other station. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  So don't sweat it, people.  Nothing was happening.  And a lot of people were asking why we didn't take Jonah Hill yesterday because we're finally putting our foot down.  We like Jonah Hill.  I'm a fan of Jonah Hill, but the fact is he kind of blew us off, or his people blew us off when Moneyball was out.  And we have to put our foot down, and hopefully the word gets out to the publicist.  You just can't do that.  You can't pick and choose.  Got to call some people.  It wouldn't have killed Jonah to do 10 minutes with us when Moneyball came out, just at the very least to say hi. 
[01:48:00]  And now you got, you know, he's back with a movie like 21 Jump Street, which obviously needs way more help than a Moneyball.  So hence, then he comes back to us, and we can't play that game anymore, no matter who it is.  We're the shitty movie show.  Yeah.  We're the shitty movie show.  And we finally have had it.  Yeah.  You know, if it's okay for you to come in for every movie leading up to Moneyball, and then all of a sudden it has a little Oscar buzz and what's not, and you can't blow us off. 
[01:48:30]  You just can't do that.  Yeah.  He said he didn't know, but he did know because people were asking him on Twitter.  You were asking him on Twitter.  I respect that he got back to me and said, look, I really didn't know whether that's true or not.  At least he, you know, he realized it was pretty serious to us and got back to us.  After the show.  Yeah.  Here's the thing.  And I understand.  He wanted to do Howard.  Go ahead.  Do Howard.  We don't care.  We're not like that as a show.  But when you want to do that, and you still won't come in after, and your publisher goes, nope, this time it's a no. 
[01:49:00]  We got the no for weeks before.  That was one.  They, well, we got to do that.  So you know what?  I was dead set against him coming back in, and I really do like the guy.  I think he's funny, and I liked him as a person.  Yeah.  But as a show, you get a little tired of, like, being reasonable and still getting shit on.  Right.  Like, we're not a territorial radio show.  We don't give a fuck.  Like, Amy, we were talking to Amy Schumer is a good friend.  She's been doing this show for a while.  Well, she wanted to do Howard, and she called. 
[01:49:30]  She's like, as a friend.  I said, you fucking bitch.  No, she's like, she's like, this is not an issue if I do start.  And I'm like, no, the show doesn't care.  Have fun.  And what does she do the next time?  She comes right back here the next.  Like, that's what a fucking friend of the show does.  And there's other females that, for some reason, they're scared of how Howard will handle them  doing other radio shows.  It's so weird to me.  Lisa Lampanelli comes to mind.  We know Lisa Lampanelli.  We go way back with the broad. 
[01:50:00]  Get it, bro.  She has to show this weird loyalty to Howard Stern.  Ah, slut.  Just calling everyone slut.  I want to make the news.  Makes her a pussy in my eyes.  I don't know why some people won't do the show.  She told me on the street, yeah, I would love to do your show.  I ran into her once.  And then she has to, like, show this weird loyalty to Howard.  He don't give a fuck about you in the end.  You should really wake up to that before it's too late.  I don't know why some people won't do it.  I don't even care, you know, it's only people who have been here before 
[01:50:30]  and then have an issue with coming back.  It's like, nah.  Like Russell Brandt, like, he's another guy.  I liked him when he was in the studio.  I thought he was a fun guest.  Right.  I thought he was open.  He was a great guest.  And I enjoyed him a lot.  Yeah.  But if you're going to come back and just do Stern and then completely blow us off,  A, fair enough, but I never want to have him on again.  Right.  But it's not even a fuck you.  It really isn't.  He's done with this show.  I accept that.  Because eventually he will request to come back, eventually. 
[01:51:00]  But we had Russell Brandt on when no one in America knew who the fuck this guy was.  Yeah, he was.  I mean, no one.  They were bus marketing for getting Sarah Marshall.  And we had him and Jason.  And you know what?  Jason Segel still comes back.  Yeah, man.  He's a cool guy.  He's becoming bigger and bigger.  He comes back every fucking time.  Yeah.  So I was happy to say absolutely no to him and to certain – anyone that does that –  I would have had him on just to try to discuss how he felt.  But I'm completely fine that he wasn't on yesterday.  Yeah, because it would have been – well, the first thing we're doing is – we're going to do this first. 
[01:51:30]  Right.  You know what?  Knock yourself out.  Enjoy.  Right.  But I'm just – you get tired of your show.  And said it.  We're – what did you say?  I love that.  We're the shit movie show.  We're the shit movie show.  Shit movie show.  If you've got a shit movie to promote, you certainly will do our show.  But if it's one that is getting a little buzz and getting really good reviews, you don't necessarily need to do Opie and Anthony.  Not true for everyone, by the way, but – 
[01:52:00]  No, no, no.  And a lot of this is –  But a lot of people it is absolutely true with.  And I'll tell you what could change that, and it sounds to me bitching, but if this studio is a little bit bigger and we had cameras in here and things that made it look like it's more of an event, people and publicists would look at this as a different radio show.  Well, I'm sure Baldy will get right on that.  It's very busy.  I don't think he'll be able to get right on that.  I don't understand why I don't think I'm capable of doing the job for you guys.  I don't know. 
[01:52:30]  You saw Weez's studio.  He does these impersonations.  I swear.  You think it was the real people.  Thank you.  Have you been doing this?  Yes, Weez's studio is huge.  We just – you know, me and Jimmy went up to Rochester.  Jimmy had shows.  By the way, we didn't even speak – talk about it yesterday, but the shows were amazing.  Thank you.  It was a great trip.  And the fucking fans up there are rabid.  Hard grip.  They really love this show.  And we went in and did some radio with Weez in.  Yeah.  And we're looking at this fucking beautiful studio, right?  And I go, God, Weez, I love your studio.  He goes, I modeled it after what you guys had in New York. 
[01:53:00]  Great.  Which made me even more depressed because I'm like, oh, that's right.  We were the prototype for Weez's studio.  And then we get thrown out.  This shitty fucking box.  And thrown into this shitty fucking studio that they don't understand why it bothers us so.  They know.  They just don't give a shit.  It's all right, though, because they're going to get Opie and Anthony's show channel stickers for the windows.  You hear about that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're putting them there, eye level.  So, oh, look, who's coming down the hallway?  Old chemo head. 
[01:53:30]  So, wait, they are getting Opie and Anthony stickers?  Yeah, yeah, to go around the perimeter.  So, you know, if we take pictures or video, people know that they're up there.  How about they stop committing to this room?  How about they stop committing?  How about, you know what we're doing?  Great idea.  We're having something installed.  How about you don't drill into the cement?  How about we work on a bigger room?  On moving somewhere else.  Right.  I told these guys that the easy solution is to just blow out this wall, man. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  This is the smallest studio we've had since I've been with you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're going backwards.  Yeah.  Backwards.  We've been going backwards for about five years now.  It's fucking...  Maybe four.  I don't want to bitch, but...  Four years we've been going backwards.  It goes...  That does tie in with the guest thing.  Sure.  It just looks like a shitty radio show.  It just looks like one of fucking 50.  Yeah, yeah.  We're just another one.  Right.  And it's not one of 50.  And I tell you what, sometimes I doubt that.  I'm like, you know what?  Maybe just nobody listens.  And then I do a gig like Rochester, and I see how hardcore the fans are. 
[01:54:30]  Right.  And most radio shows don't get that.  I mean, they really don't.  They're hardcore fans.  They love stupid chip and all the nonsense that we do.  They listen.  They're not just old fans from Terrestrial.  Right.  They're people who listen now.  Because as soon as I go like this, the fucking place goes crazy.  They know exactly what it is.  I know that they're new fans.  Right.  And it's just that reaction you get from those people.  You know that they're fucking the same fans we have here.  So most radio shows don't get that. 
[01:55:00]  Wow.  Julianne Moore really does look like Sarah Palin in that movie.  Oh, Palin?  Fuck yeah, man.  They did a good job.  Got the makeup right.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  Woody Harrelson's who played with him.  Wow, look at that.  That's crazy.  Woody Harrelson.  That looks just like her.  Yeah, they did a good job.  She's got fake teeth.  From a distance.  Oh, yeah.  There's some fake like cheekbones.  Yeah.  Fake cheekbones or fake clit.  They should mix this movie with Boogie Nights.  Yeah.  Or pardon, Boogie Nights. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, give John McCain the big cock.  Damn fucker.  I want to see if she sounded like her.  Let's hear it.  I just missed it, unfortunately.  All right.  Hey.  Ed Harris is playing McCain.  That's not bad.  He looks kind of like him.  That is pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to see this thing in the special theater.  Oh, it's on HBO.  Oh, well then, fuck it.  Sure, I'll watch it.  Uh-huh.  We're all going to see it at the same time. 
[01:56:00]  Uh-huh.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Hey, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  The question is this.  Wow.  We started this a couple years ago now?  Yeah.  Two years ago?  It was probably more like three years ago.  Okay.  So, for the past three years, we've been keeping track of dead wrestlers.  Yeah.  And one day, one of us said, I bet you we can't go 100 days without a wrestler dying.  That's right.  100 days. 
[01:56:30]  And we're three years into this.  That's right.  Have we finally broken the 100-day thing?  Well, it's been more than 100 days since you last asked.  That's true.  Okay.  You know.  So, pick up from the last time we did this, which has probably been a while now.  I think it was around September.  Okay.  When we lost Little Tokyo.  Little Tokyo.  Nuclear accident?  No.  He was a little midget wrestler.  Aww.  He married a girl named Bonnie? 
[01:57:00]  He was 70.  So, it's not that bad.  And died of a heart attack.  For a midget?  That's 400 regular person.  That really is old for a midget.  It's pretty good.  But he died of a heart attack and tongue cancer.  Well, Jesus.  Tongue cancer.  Tongue cancer.  Yeah.  It's because his head is ass height all the time.  Yes.  Tongue's always hitting the ground.  Picking up cigarette butts.  Little twerp tongue.  Then, we made it all the way, 77 days.  Nice.  To November 22nd, when a guy who wrestled on the independents as well as Japan named Bison 
[01:57:30]  Smith died at the age of 38 due to heart complications.  Oh, boy.  And you're not, like, reaching for wrestlers?  These are guys that...  Sorry.  Well, how about it?  That guy just take a tumble?  Is that live?  Yeah.  Out in front of the Fox building, they're doing these races with Carl Lewis back and forth  and the girls are racing and some guy was racing this fat guy and he fell on his face. 
[01:58:00]  Fell right on his face.  Oh, I'm so happy.  I wish he was really hurt.  That's right across the street from us.  Yeah.  He's embarrassed.  Yes, he is.  Oops.  That'll be everywhere.  Go ahead, Sam.  Oh, there it is.  The reason why.  He face-planted.  Oh, boy, and his hat fell off.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Was that a good one?  I wish he was carrying a knife.  It would have been great if his glasses broke.  Did he have a small mustache, too?  Yeah.  Should have fallen off.  A little Hitler mustache thing.  It looks kind of Hitler-ish, doesn't it? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, exactly.  He was booing a Jew when he tripped.  Is the Hitler thing coming back?  The mustache?  I mean, oh.  The ideology.  Oh, I thought you meant that.  Oh, the ideology certainly is.  It certainly is.  This is a new wrestler.  Did you hear about this new wrestler?  Who?  I don't know.  What was his first name?  Why did you ask him?  It wasn't...  Well, I've heard rumors on the internet about some guy named Ace Sherbert.  Oh, yeah.  Ace Sherbert. 
[01:59:00]  The worst name ever for everything.  Ace Sherbert is my new wrestler.  Where I'm going to walk out in my wrestling.  I'm going to wear a hat.  It's got four aces on it.  Oh, that's good.  And I'm going to be eating a ball of Sherbert while I taunt my opponent.  That's pretty literal.  Yeah, I know.  Ace Sherbert.  And I'm going to do the scoop.  It's my big move.  Oh, that's pretty good.  What does it look like?  Where you just take your arm and you go, scoop.  Scoop.  Well, how do you get the guy with the scoop?  Like, you just scoop him up.  Oh.  And you throw him down like a scoop. 
[01:59:30]  And the whole scoop and Sherbert.  Standard.  Do you think the audience will, like, bring scoops?  I speak scoops.  Of course.  And you'll hear them going, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  Like that when they want you to do the big move.  Scoop!  Scoop!  Scoop!  Sherbert Scoop!  The big Sherbert Scoop!  I like it.  They'll be able to sell giant foam scoops.  Yeah.  Oh, that, too.  Different flavors, too.  Jimmy Norton, Vince McMahon, I want to buy Scoop.  I want to buy Scoop and I'll pay anything for him. 
[02:00:00]  His name is Ace Sherbert.  Ace Sherbert, whatever it is, I'm going to call him Scoop.  Now you can't use the name.  I own it because I mentioned it.  That's all it takes with Vince McMahon.  I'd be good on the mic, too, as Ace Sherbert.  Oh, work the mic a little.  Yeah.  What's your promo sound like?  I hope you guys know that I'm going to mean this in spades, that I'm going to club you  until you're just a pile of diamonds because I got heart.  Oh, see, all the suits.  That's good. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  And I'm going to give you a raspberry and you're going to be leaving this ring feeling  like there's sour lemons on you.  The Sherbert part.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Sherbert part.  The Sherbert part.  I'm going to freeze you and Scoop you.  Wow.  That's good, right?  Wow.  Why would you eat Sherbert before a match?  No, I'm going to eat it in the ring while I'm walking around with my hat waving at the  crowd, scooping Sherbert into my mouth.  How are you going to wave at the crowd if you have one hand with Sherbert in the other?  You wave with the scoop.  I might even wrestle with the ball. 
[02:01:00]  How about this move?  You pin the guy into the corner, right?  Yeah.  Then you take your Sherbert and you open his mouth up and you put so much in and give him  the brain freeze.  That's good.  And then the guy goes like, ah, and he's getting the brain freeze and you pin him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  That was, and I'll stand up and I'll go, that was the boysenberry shuffle.  Whoa, and you do something weird with your arms there.  Yeah.  Jesus.  It's terrible.  It's Sherbert rules.  It's Sherbert. 
[02:01:30]  I could easily see somebody being blinded with Sherbert being thrown in their eyes.  Absolutely.  Because the ref is looking the other way.  Oh my God.  And they have a cold, delicious treat thrown in their face.  He's got that damn Sherbert again.  Sometimes I would, I'd have my pretty girl at the side of the ring with some Sherbert.  Yeah.  And when I got thrown against the ring, my head would go back and she'd scoop some Sherbert  into my mouth for strength.  And it would be like Popeye with the spinach.  Yeah.  And then I'd ricochet back off the ring and do the old Sherbert scoop.  Sherbert scoop. 
[02:02:00]  I like it.  You need a catchphrase, people are saying.  Oh, yeah.  A wrestling catchphrase.  Hold on.  Yeah.  I'm aces with you.  Work on it.  That's good.  What would the girl's name be?  Yeah.  Elizabeth.  No, they had Elizabeth.  No, that's better.  Mine's different.  Oh, there's a different one.  Oh, okay.  A different one?  Yeah.  Matilda. 
[02:02:30]  I think the name is Bulldog.  That ain't it.  Matilda's good.  No.  For a girl named Matilda in a house dress.  Oh, wow.  A house dress.  She's got like aces all over it.  Aces High.  In the night, take fly, from the all-new sportsbook, we present the premiere showing of Aces High.  Aces High.  With Sasha Seminoff Orchestra.  Oh, and the Aces, the eighth Rothstein, Sam Rothstein dances.  It's great.  Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best football handicapper in America. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, that's the way.  You want to do the wrestling death clock there.  Yeah, what do we got?  So you had the midget wrestler, Little Tokyo 70, heart attack, tongue cancer.  Right.  All right, go ahead.  And then Bison Smith in November at 38, heart complications.  And people knew who Bison Smith was.  Yeah, he was very impactful to a lot of wrestlers.  That's why I counted him.  Okay.  Because they worked on the indies at the same time and he trained a lot of people.  Oh.  And then we made it 56 days to January 17th when we lost Savannah Jack, who wrestled for Bill Watts' UWF promotion, which was a... 
[02:03:30]  I don't know if he's stretching the bit or not.  No, no, no, no, no.  Because it's his bit.  He wants it to keep going.  Right.  I've got a lot of bits at this point.  If you start going to backyard wrestling, kids...  No, UWF was a Bill Watts promotion that tried to compete with WWE at one point.  And people would say, yeah, in the wrestling world, that's big.  Yeah, UWF counts.  Bill Watt?  And that was 56 days. 
[02:04:00]  That was heart disease at 63.  And then the most recent one was on March 4th, just a couple days ago, stopping the clock at 47 days.  Oh, boy.  Was former WWE superstar, Doug Furness, who they're saying died due to...  He was too hot.  Overdealing.  Complications of Parkinson's at 50.  I bet he wasn't stoked about that.  Get it?  I wonder if he listened to Burn It Embers. 
[02:04:30]  Did he also have the flu?  Get it?  That's the pipe that comes out of the top.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't know the...  I've never exclaimed stuff.  Oh, well.  I don't know duck work humor.  I don't get it.  Yeah, duck work humor.  Please.  His gimmick was not that Furness related.  No?  No.  I would have done that.  Yeah.  He's the guy I recognize, because that's when I used to watch.  He was in a tag team.  Yeah.  Doug Furness and Phil LaFont.  Doug Furness.  And Phil LaFont? 
[02:05:00]  Was LaFont empty?  Why didn't he use Furness if that was his name?  Why'd they keep his name as Furness then?  I don't know.  He was just a guy named Doug Furness.  Who's named Furness?  That's silly.  But I'll tell you who has camel toe.  Oh, Kenny.  Oh, God.  Kenny.  And he's camel toe.  Holy shit.  That is severe camel toe.  What are you doing? 
[02:05:30]  Wow.  Kenny's camel toe is horrendous.  Right up the ball bag seam.  Each ball is residing on the opposite side of the center seam.  Yes.  Is that uncomfortable, Kenny?  You usually wear very big pants.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good time.  So you're trying to tell me in three years we still haven't gone 100 days without a wrestler dying.  No.  Right now we're at two.  Two days. 
[02:06:00]  Two days.  We've got to start the clock.  We've got to start it one more time.  I don't think this happens in any other sport or sports entertainment.  Furness.  It's a tough lifestyle.  All right.  There's your update on the dead wrestler clock.  Hey, Pat Robertson.  Don't we love Pat Robertson?  If he doesn't mind.  Oh.  It's running.  Can he just get dumber and dumber?  I want to pat him.  Cracker, cracker, cracker, cracker, cracker, cracker, cracker, cracker, cracker. 
[02:06:30]  Oh.  Jimmy's smashing the crackers.  He tried to get my banana.  Yeah.  Oh.  I was too quick.  Do you want these?  No.  No crackers.  He's very violent with our food.  No, I'm trying to be better with my eating.  He's getting those carbs away.  Your Weight Watchers thing, by the way, in Rochester completely fell apart.  No, it didn't.  Can you be honest with me and Kenny?  I finished under my weekly total by a lot.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Did he, Kenny?  I keep track.  He was making all sorts of deals with himself.  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  And reasoning why he needed a...  Carryover points?  Carryover points.  He was trying to find other people's points.  He was trying...  I don't know.  It just seems like too much work, Kenny.  No, Jim was very conscientious.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  You think he came in under his number for the week?  Yes.  Yeah.  He was just getting acclimated to using the app.  Acclimated.  Yeah.  All right.  He did good for himself all weekend. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  And I say myself, like those little ice cream bars that we love, the ones that you like  that are the little...  Which ones?  They're like Skinny Cow, those type things.  I fucking like the Skinny Cow.  I'll go over in points at night for that.  I'll go over by four points because I have so many for the week set up.  Yeah.  You treat yourself, but you don't feel like you're starving.  Pat Robertson.  We love this guy.  He's a fucking lunatic.  Oh, yeah.  We had a bunch of tornadoes, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Pat Robertson says, more prayer could have kept the tornadoes away. 
[02:08:00]  That's what I was saying.  We played a prayer video yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  It did nothing.  And that lady had some deep prayer shit she was spewing.  She was speaking in tongues.  That's right.  She was.  It explains how God makes them.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  God people are really nuts.  Is it a Virgin Mary queef?  Asshole Pat Robertson is.  Why was he ever relevant?  He's a lunatic.  Yeah.  Another guy people just buy into. 
[02:08:30]  Religious people.  Here's what he had to say.  Why did God send the tornadoes?  God didn't send tornadoes.  God set up a world in which certain currents interfere and interact with other currents.  When you have a warm group of air coming out of the south, coming up against the cold  masses up in the north, you'll get vortexes, and that in turn will spawn tornadoes.  Because God doesn't send tornadoes to hurt people. 
[02:09:00]  He doesn't send, you know, we call them acts of God, but they're not.  Oh, what is it?  So, all I can say is that why do you build houses in a place where tornadoes are apt to happen?  He's doing bits.  Well, he's actually right.  Yeah.  God didn't send it.  Why did you stop building your house there?  Yeah.  He did say God didn't send the tornado, which we say the same thing.  Oh, God was busy.  And he's saying, why the fuck are you building in Tornado Alley? 
[02:09:30]  Can't you control what God does with prayer?  I would think so.  Yeah.  It would have to happen.  Yeah.  Well, and this year, of course, the weather patterns, the warm winter and the warm, you  know, early part of the year that we're having seems to affect all of that.  But I think the bigger question for people spiritually is always, not so much why did God send them,  but why didn't he intervene?  You know, you think people always ask that question when there's tragedy?  Well, I mean, if enough people will pray, he will intervene.  You could probably. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, my God.  You know what?  There wasn't enough people praying.  Not enough prayer.  See?  God likes to look and say, no, you're not quite doing it.  God's like those guys that go, we having a good time tonight?  Yeah.  I can't hear you all.  We having a good time tonight?  Yeah.  God's that guy.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He can't get just one person praying.  He's going to be like, fuck this.  Ain't worth my time.  But as he looks down from above.  Yeah.  What about the people where he goes, oh, wow, those those people really do believe in me. 
[02:10:30]  I should try to take care of them at the very least.  Oh, well.  No, it has to be the collective case.  Sarah, Sarah.  Reviewing.  You could pray.  Go.  Jesus.  Still the storm.  You can still storms.  But, you know, the hurricane, for example.  Is a release mechanism that God set in to take the heat out of this world and to transfer heat around various parts of the globe.  It's very necessary.  The fact that people decide they want to build houses on the edge of an ocean. 
[02:11:00]  Free will fucks us again.  Free will fucks us again.  It's just a dope, though.  He says it's necessary, but God could change the rules at any moment.  Right.  So he can make it not necessary anymore with the heat, then.  Yeah.  Do you think God needs a hurricane to move heat around the earth?  Of course not.  I think God could just move heat around the earth.  Right.  He could do it with a giant fucking, like, metal monolith if he wanted to.  It doesn't need to be a hurricane.  How come all these things are hurtful and destructive? 
[02:11:30]  Do you think God just make it warmer?  Yeah, just make it warmer.  It's warmer over there.  Oh, there.  How did that happen?  I did it.  I said so.  No rhyme or reason to it.  So fuck you, science.  That would be a big fuck you to science.  It'd get people really, like, you know, into the faith-based thing.  Yeah.  What's a five?  Category five?  It's like the finger of God.  We really need a fork and knife for that bit, I'm not thinking. 
[02:12:00]  Clang.  We need that clang off a plate.  Finger of God.  I got to see that movie.  It's so bad.  Is it really douchey?  The Extreme.  It's not good.  The Extreme.  It doesn't hold up.  Huge fucking blockbuster.  I just want to see that one scene.  Yeah, the music.  It's already here.  Oh, is that what is fun, that movie?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's so bad.  You make a good point with the God thing, though. 
[02:12:30]  One statement by God would change everybody around and go, ah, fuck.  Yeah.  So why is he waiting?  Wouldn't it be faithful?  He wants faith instead of irrefutable truth.  Maybe he should realize at this point the faith thing isn't working out as well as he would like,  and maybe he needs to up his game a little bit.  If you want praise, I would make it so everybody that prays and is God-fearing, only good things  happen to them, never bad things.  You would see people hop on that God bandwagon in a second.  Be like, yeah, okay, it's been proven. 
[02:13:00]  I like it.  Why is it that got to be faith-based?  Why do we need free will?  Don't you have...  He should be able to adjust the game plan.  We're too stupid.  Of course we're going to fuck it up.  I hate free will.  I like my life on a track.  I like the song Free Will by Rush.  Well, I will choose free will.  That obvious Rush sound.  Yes. 
[02:13:30]  And they're not in the Hall of Fame.  Has to be mentioned every time we watch Rush.  Now, is it because they're Canucks?  Here's the rest of the Pat Robertson clip.  The fact that people decide they want to build houses on the edge of an ocean, it's their fault.  It's not God's.  It's the same thing if you're going to build a house on the San Andreas Fault.  Where are we supposed to live, Pat?  You know the earth is faulted.  They're going to be earthquakes.  So don't blame God for doing something foolish. 
[02:14:00]  But we're talking about unpredictable tornadoes that just come down.  Where are we supposed to live, Pat?  No hurricanes.  Okay, so we've got to take out the entire, at least, east coast.  Most of it, anyway.  Yeah.  Then earthquakes, so we've got to stay out of the west coast.  Tornadoes, so we've got to stay out of the midwest.  What about blizzards, deadly blizzards up in the north?  Because I was ready to say, hello, Canada.  There's nowhere to live because God has this plan that fucks everything up. 
[02:14:30]  He has it all covered.  Hey, God, how about you made us a little stronger?  You know what?  I could take an ant.  I could drop an ant from fucking ten feet.  To an ant, that's a million miles to drop.  And he walks away.  How about you give us that kind of strength, God?  That's right.  And mandibles.  Yeah, and giant mandibles.  But as humans...  And big mandibles.  As humans, we should have been able to figure out how to put an extra coat on ourselves.  Exoskeleton.  So we could fall.  Yeah.  How great would it be to fall out of this building every day when you have to leave, knowing you're going to be all right? 
[02:15:00]  Too many people by the elevator are like, I'm taking the window.  And you just throw yourself out the window.  You hit the ground.  You're like, ah, you shake it off.  Brush yourself off and walk away.  Yeah, it's like, all right.  How great that would be.  Yeah, I'm fine.  I got an exoskeleton.  Would you just jump out of buildings all day long?  Be the most fun thing ever.  Oh, my God.  Fucking fire in a building.  People would just, fuck it.  Hey, fireman, how you doing?  Yeah, we're jumping.  Here's a question for the scientists out there and the eggheads.  How far does an ant have to fall where you finally kill it? 
[02:15:30]  I don't think he would.  I think you could drop an ant from a fucking jetliner.  And I think he'll just slowly...  He doesn't have enough...  Why are we studying that shit?  They're so light.  His mass to, I think, what gives him wind resistance.  Right.  I think the wind resistance slows him down so much that the weight doesn't matter.  And he just...  And then he's got that goddamn exoskeleton.  We should study this shit. 
[02:16:00]  Love the exoskeleton.  How great would this be to have this power?  Yeah.  Wouldn't be cool.  But no, God, thanks.  You make us fucking get mushed.  You fall off a fucking four-foot ladder.  You break something.  So an ant can fall off a table, but they have to live in underground...  Gotta make some sacrifices.  Did you ever see the fucking anthill that got uncovered when they put cement in it?  Oh, when they put cement and then dug it up?  Did you see how far it went?  Did you see that? 
[02:16:30]  No.  That's pretty cool.  Look that up on YouTube.  It's cement in the anthill.  They do it.  I think it was an abandoned anthill.  And they pour cement in it and they cut around it.  Like, they just very carefully...  Yeah.  As he finds that...  See how big it is.  I won't go to his call, but...  And we usually don't go down this road, but it's worth it today.  I want to thank Jimmy.  Virgin Mary Queef maybe made me jump the curb.  Could be.  Virgin Mary Queef.  All right.  Where is this anthill?  Like Africa or something?  It's actually in my yard.  Turn this...  I think Africa. 
[02:17:00]  Required is extraordinary.  It's a festival.  Extraordinary.  So what is this, Jimmy, again?  Three days?  They excavated...  Excavated and they put in...  They cement to the holes and then cut around it.  To see how far this...  ...of mechanical diggers.  The scientists...  Oh, diggers.  ...from tons of earth...  ...was Africa.  ...at last, they begin to see the structure of the city-state.  And then you can see the giant digger has pulled out so much dirt around this anthill, 
[02:17:30]  and it's massive.  That's easily twice the size of the studio.  It's a city.  That's not saying it's big.  Yeah, that could be...  The hole is, too.  Subterranean highways connecting the main chambers.  Whoa!  Put this on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, for the people.  ...and lead to many fungus gardens and rubbish pits.  In a fungus garden.  How big are the ants, though?  Some regular-sized ants.  They're as big as people.  Yeah.  ...with good ventilation and provide the shortest transport routes. 
[02:18:00]  Isn't that amazing?  How do they do this?  Yeah, how do they get the cement in there?  And how do they know how to do it?  How do they know to work as a collective?  Everything looks like it has been designed by an architect.  Holy fuck.  Odd Vandelay.  Of course that isn't true.  These guys are probably 12 feet underground, too.  Right?  Yeah, about 12 feet under.  There's all these little bubbles...  ...coming off of...  It looks like little tree branches with little sacks on them.  Yeah.  And that's for oxygen and storage and garbage and... 
[02:18:30]  But the ants we have in America, they don't build shit like this, right?  The structure covers 50 square meters and goes 8 meters into the earth.  What's a meter?  In its construction...  Almost like a yard.  ...the colony moved 40 tons of soil.  Yeah.  Billions of ant loads of soil were brought to the surface.  Each load weighed four times as much as the worker.  It's amazing.  And in human terms, was carried a kilometer to the surface.  Damn.  That's pretty cool.  I'm going to break that and just kick it over. 
[02:19:00]  That is fucking amazing.  It really is.  It is the equivalent of building the Great Wall of China.  It is truly a wonder of the world.  So maybe the ants built the fucking pyramids then.  They know, right?  Could be.  Giant ants.  Oh, my God.  Giant ants, though.  Sure.  If I was there, I would just keep saying, hey, where's all the uncles?  Place would be cracking up.  I wonder how much bigger ants would have to be to fuck us up to where we would just fucking  not exist.  Like, how much bigger?  Do you think the size of a fucking cat?  Think if ants were the size of cats, we would be fucking dead as a race of beings? 
[02:19:30]  I think they could be a lot smaller than that.  Smaller?  Like a rat?  Rat-sized ants?  Like a mouse.  Because now picture the same amount of ants.  Yes.  Same amount.  As big as a rat.  No.  Do you think they take us?  Smaller, though.  Yes.  Yes.  As big as...  I said a mouse.  An elephant.  A mouse?  Elephant-sized ants.  That's crazy.  With the jaws they got.  Mandibles.  Mandibles.  I say jaws. 
[02:20:00]  You would think the size of a mouse.  You could still crush them.  Yeah, we're smarter than they are.  I'm at that fucking outer fucking shell.  I'm talking about you have to fight a fucking giant ant.  Yeah, you could fist fight the motherfucker.  You're going to be able to take out a few, sure, but there you have a lot.  And they can lift 50 times their weight.  Oh, man.  So a mouse...  So a mouse lifting 50 times its weight, that would be, well, I guess less than 50 pounds.  But now his mandible can definitely inflict some harm on you.  Definitely. 
[02:20:30]  But not a fatal or a chop your fucking foot off if he's the size of a mouse.  I think it's a bullet ant.  If they bite you now, they do that ritual.  They hurt you now.  Oh, I know.  I know.  But...  But...  They can't drive tanks.  You could run away.  Oh, you're saying we use our fucking...  Military.  ...know-how.  Yeah.  All right.  No way.  Squash those little faggots.  I'm thinking they're the size of...  You might have to go out.  Half the size of us.  Oh, shit.  Half the size of us.  That way you could fight them, like punch them.  Touch them.  They're 50 times. 
[02:21:00]  That means they could break your hand.  50 times away.  Yeah, one punch would take you out.  On their exoskeleton.  You'd hate it if you could touch them.  Then they'd start lifting tanks up if they were half the size of us.  It'd be fucking crazy.  What about guns?  You could just start fucking shooting them.  They could invent...  Can you get it through their outer shell?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You'd be able to get it through their exoskeleton.  They would invent better guns.  Did you see the city they invented?  No, no, no.  They're stupid and they don't have thumbs.  No, stop it.  They could build great cities.  Yeah.  But they're not fucking pulling triggers.  You know what they're good at, though?  Hiding spaces. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, they could come out of nowhere.  Fuck, they could come out of your closet.  You open your closet to get dressed in the morning,  ants already made a hole in the floor.  I think you're right about the cat size.  I think that's the size.  Cat size is where the tipping point is.  If an ant was what?  Size of a cat.  Wow!  And the question is answered by Jason, North Carolina,  because this is very similar to something Ronnie B said.  Ronnie B.  I love Ronnie B's animal scenario.  Let's go to Jason, North Carolina.  Morning, Jason. 
[02:22:00]  Morning, boys.  Yeah.  On Ronnie B's line of the day, one of his most popular ones was he said,  if ants were the size of ducks, would you all be wearing chains right now?  That's true.  There you go.  We'd be slaves to the duck size ants.  So the size of a duck.  It's about the same size as a cat.  Hi, buddy.  Yeah, yeah.  That's about right.  Cat size ants.  I'm thinking three or four pounds, if they lift 50 times their weight.  We'd be doomed.  We'd be fucked.  Here's another fact.  How'd that work out that they don't have ants that big?  We're doing fun facts now. 
[02:22:30]  So glad.  We got a fun fact from Ryan in Minnesota.  Ryan.  Hey, fun fact, Dick.  If you were to take all the ants in the world and weigh them on a scale,  they would weigh more than all the humans put together.  Yeah, it's crazy, though, because I don't have a scale that big.  No.  Well, not if you had E-Rock on it.  It's not true.  Oh, sorry.  Speaking of E-Rock, you know how we get topical?  Someone wants to know why you didn't go with the Oreo cookie today.  100 years old.  Oh. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, what the fuck?  Did he eat the prep sheet?  The Oreo cookie is 100 years old?  That's right.  The one on this desk.  That's very progressive.  I would love an Oreo.  Of them back in the day.  The cookie, I mean.  Yeah, yeah.  I think Ronnie's mad at us in Alabama.  Why?  Ronnie, are you mad at us?  What do you got?  Oh, man, I ain't mad.  I was just going to say, you know, going back to Pat Robertson,  you know, the dude's saying a lot of the things that y'all have said, 
[02:23:30]  but because God was mentioned, he's an ass.  That's true.  Thank you for agreeing.  I mean, you know.  Why does God take out the God-loving people along with the sinners, though?  I mean, it's just the way, I mean, I can't.  Why can't he pick and choose?  He seems pretty damn powerful.  Why doesn't he just take out the sinners?  And then the sinners would go, oh, fuck, there's something to this God,  so we should change our ways.  Why does he take out the God-loving people, too?  I don't get that.  But what kind of God would he be if he didn't give everybody the same opportunity? 
[02:24:00]  But he's not giving, oh, to die horribly?  Exactly.  Gee, thanks for that fucking opportunity.  How about at the very least you save the baby that got thrown out of the house by the tornado?  Because I don't even think the baby has lived long enough to do any sin shit yet.  Yeah, explain that one.  Explain that there, Pat Robertson.  Explain that.  Explain that.  Well, the thing is, God gets blamed for a lot of crap that just happens.  Not everything is because of God.  How do you know he's supposed to be involved in everything?  You blame the guy that is responsible for everything. 
[02:24:30]  You go right to the top.  That's right.  He's the CEO.  That's true.  But see, y'all keep saying, well, how come he ain't doing this?  How arrogant are people that they, you know, he's God?  What the crap does God have to prove to anybody?  He's God.  There's nothing else.  There's nothing else.  But what?  He's God.  Well, but he's kind of, he's kind of an asshole because you have the God-loving people that  that's not even good enough for God.  When is it good enough for God? 
[02:25:00]  Well, again, man, I mean, I can say, I'll go ahead and tell you, I'm a Christian.  Really?  Yes, I am.  Very surprised by that.  Oh, well, you shouldn't be.  Why do we even try to do intelligent shit on our show?  Holy shit.  We should just be farting all day long.  Insanely horrible.  Go ahead, Ronnie.  Yes.  You're looking at Sam.  I'll just say, you know, I'm a Christian.  Really?  I don't have all the answers.  Nobody has all the answers, man. 
[02:25:30]  I do.  I do.  I want to wear it.  Sorry.  I did.  I'll take that back.  When they get all the answers, they take the questions right away.  That's a good one.  More importantly, I want to wear an ant helmet to work every day.  That would be foolish shit.  No one would fuck with you, man.  Ants are scary looking motherfuckers.  When you put them under a microscope.  They're a microscope.  Holy shit.  I want to come to work like that.  If that was the size of a cat, we'd be finished.  And you could throw it off the roof of a building.  And it wouldn't even hurt him.  Nothing.  Is that his creepy eyes right there?  Yes.  His creepy eyes are up top. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, my God.  What are those two things over there?  Those are antennae.  No, at the bottom, though.  Doesn't it look like eyes?  Those are feathers.  Where?  The fucking things that look like eyes?  Look at his mouth.  Imagine getting him dicks sucked by that thing.  Whoa.  What the fuck is mouth?  He's got nostrils.  It's dimples.  Those are in those little dimples.  Yeah.  These things.  At the end of the antennas.  The fucking round thing.  Oh, no.  Those look like eyes to me.  I know they're not, but I'm just saying.  That's like a universal joint for his antenna.  Gotcha.  So he could spin around.  No, those little discs on the side of his head are his eyes.  No, I understand that. 
[02:26:30]  His compound eyes.  But it looks scary if those two little things were his eyes.  That thing looks scary regardless.  That's a monster right there.  Are those teeth?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They got to be.  Oh, man.  Those bad teeth.  Yeah, it's a good thing they're so small.  Why don't they brush their teeth?  Scary.  Their teeth look like they're rotting.  They don't make toothbrushes that small.  Let's see some more hands.  Show me some more hands.  I think we lost Alabama.  Yeah, we were.  Alabama, man.  Alabama, man.  See, look at this.  Oh, man.  It's fucking up with cricket.  It's raping the cricket. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  The cricket's way bigger.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Crickets are pussies, big-eyed douche.  Yeah, crickets.  We'd kick the shit out of them no matter how big they are.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Crickets were 40 tons.  We could knock them out in one punch.  Exactly.  Dumb crickets.  They're all soft.  Exactly.  In the yard.  You could just punch them in the stomach in your fist and go, right through them.  They're so dumb.  They give their position away at night.  Yeah.  Exactly.  How about you shut up?  Right.  Right.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  He's rubbing nervously, rubbing his legs.  He's got the Jimmy legs.  Is that where that noise comes from?  The legs rubbing?  Yeah, they rub their legs together and go, brr, brr, kick him in his face.  Why doesn't our fucking legs make noise when we rub them like that?  It does.  Rub their legs together.  They go, brr, brr, brr, brr.  Why does it make that such a loud noise?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Why don't we study this shit?  Because they have in the hair, the hair on their legs is hollow?  Maybe there is something like the hair.  And that's what the air goes through.  It's called celia, and it's hollow. 
[02:28:00]  And air goes through that.  And when it snaps back, it's almost like an instrument.  Jimmy sold that one, by the way  Yes, I made it all up  I don't think it's true, but he sold it very well  I now believe that  I got all the answers about God  You want God answers today?  Yes, I do  Alright  God created man and gave them free will  He also created nature and gave it free will  His pinches are huge, that thing  But our point is, if you're God 
[02:28:30]  Can't you change that free will?  This ant's pinchers are fucking half the side of his face  Half the size of his face  They're like lobster claws  Oh man, those deadly mandibles  Imagine them fucking biting  Is it the bullet ant that hurts so much?  Yeah, that's one of them  That'd bite you in half  I'd hate to have my dick bitten  Brian in Delaware, Brian  What's up boys?  Yeah, God is all powerful  Well, mind you, I'm all into science  But God's all powerful where he knows 
[02:29:00]  If somebody's gonna grow up and it'd be  A fuck up and destroy the earth  He'll rather destroy them when they're young  Or all that shit will fucking happen  So what happened with Hitler?  Um, he fucked up with that  God can't fuck up  See, that's the beauty of God  That's being God, he never fucks up  God never fucks up  In the end, unless he purposely fucks up  I guess he'll let a couple of them in  For us to learn  Learn what?  We're not even around long enough  To learn any real shit  By the time you go 
[02:29:30]  Oh wow, I got some shit figured out  You die  And then you gotta start over with a new one  Yeah  A new young thing  Come on  He's gotta make it kinda interesting  He's gonna  Don't wanna make it too boring for us  I'm starting  I'm starting to think you just die  Yeah, you do  You later  I'm starting to think you just die  And you just get shut off like a fucking computer  Dude, you just lay there like a cunt  That's what happens to us  And that's it  We go bye-bye in the box  That is it  I would love to think there's more 
[02:30:00]  But I don't know  There's not  I don't know  Well, maybe that baby did a little bit more damage than Hitler  How?  How?  How?  Well, you don't know  God knows  We don't know  God will know  What could a baby possibly  Oh, God only knows  So God knew that that thing would be Hitler  So he let it be born  And then he threw it around in some wind  Don't be a silly ghost, sir  Look how dumb that is  You don't know  Yes, you do  That's dumb  I know  Yeah, sometimes you just know  Yeah  It was an asshole move if there's a God  Yeah  He'd throw the baby around in the wind  Let it survive for a little while 
[02:30:30]  So everyone's like  Oh my God  A miracle through all this tragedy  And then God goes  Nah, not really  Well, God could have  It just  The pain away from him  Huh?  God could have took the pain away from the baby  Yeah, and God could have fucking blew the wind in the other direction  The kid fell out of a cunt  Got swept up in the wind  And he's dead  That's the end of it  And what about the pain  Everyone felt dead  That the baby died  That might be into the God thing  Yeah  Explain that one  Yeah, what about that?  Right  Quickly  Now you got God-loving people  That are now fucking very distraught  Over the fact that the baby died in the end  That's right  Well, nobody knows all the answers 
[02:31:00]  Only  Yeah, so you have none of them  Yeah  Not all one  You don't have any  I've never met anybody with less answers  Yeah  I was thinking about the rape thing yesterday  With Kirk Carradine  So was I  And Rick Santorum  And I decided I don't want to be part of a religion  That would force guilt  And try to force a woman  To have the baby after she's been raped  Yeah  That's a religion I don't want to be part of  I decided yesterday 
[02:31:30]  Because that's what a lot of these people really believe  That's why I joined Islam  Good for you  Yeah, because then you could just stone them  They're even more conservative, dude  Oh, really?  Good for you  Bury her up to the neck  Little bachabazi  Throwing fucking rocks at her face  But to force a woman to have the baby  After she was raped  And just get her with a lot of guilt  And that's part of the religion  No thank you  Yeah  I'll be just fucking nothing after this life 
[02:32:00]  I'll be fine with that  I'll be fine with that  Yeah  I'll enjoy my time here  And that'll be it  Yeah, and that's it  Because I can't wrap my head around  Just have a good time right now  That's what I say  Hey  I brought home some tapes  From Brother Wheeze's show  Ah  The nom  A lot of good calls  What should we do? 
[02:32:30]  You want to do the nom thing?  I don't know why ants can't get any bigger  It's called the inverse square law  The inverse square law  Of why ants can't get any bigger  It's probably something with their  Huh  Their size  Would be  Would literally crush them  After a while  If they get too big  I hope so  Their own weight  Does that happen to us too?  I think it would  If we were super sized  Iraq  But a lot of these guys 
[02:33:00]  I don't think our structure  But a lot of these guys get up to 700  And they're still walking around  They're fucked up  800  But also they're the same size  I think if  If we were  If we were on this planet  Same atmosphere  Same gravity  And everything  And you increased our size  To the point where we were  As big as  The Empire State Building  Nice  I don't think our structure itself  That works at this size  Works at that large size  I think the mass of the body  Would crack like the ankles  So what happened to the dinosaurs? 
[02:33:30]  It would crack your ankles  Too much weight  What about dinosaurs?  Well they were built different  They walked around pretty big  A lot of muscles on them legs  So why don't we work our muscles?  Short little  Little legs  Why don't we work our muscles?  What?  What was the inverted square law?  He's on the line  Chris in Maryland  Hey Chris  What's going on boy?  Hey man  Hey  Spock explain  Hit him on  Yeah no  The inverse square law  You got it exactly right  Like if ants got much  Their legs would collapse  You know  Exoskeletons only work up  To a certain size 
[02:34:00]  And they can't support  The weight of their own structure  Ah  You would talk about  How people  With the size of the Empire  State Building  Even before  You know  Our bones would snap  Yeah yeah  We'd never be able  To make it up to our head  Even with a giant heart pump  And that shit around  Yeah we would need  Like a real squat  Kind of thick  Leg  And leg bones  Would have to be  Huge  Like it would be  Kind of  Like a person  Would have to be on  Or a being  Would have to be on Jupiter  What does inverse square mean 
[02:34:30]  I don't know what that means  You're an inverse square  Yeah I'm cool and hip  The inverse square law  Is  It's pretty simple  It's just that  You know  You have the square  Of a circle  Say you know  Square of two is four  Square of three is nine  Square of four is  You know  It increases geometrically  The same thing happens  Inversely proportional  To the size of the animal  Oh  And I'm sure I'm getting  Half this wrong  If somebody's gonna call up  And bitch  I like it 
[02:35:00]  Well the inverse square  What happens is  When you get to a certain height  You can't get  You can't get fluid  Up to the brain  And a lot of times  The brain will  It'll cease to function  Basically  Because there's a  There's no way  A scab can form  A bit of a  A crustacean  A crustacean  And you're gonna have  Seepage into the bloodstream  Seepage  Death will be pretty quick  Fluids  Fluids 
[02:35:30]  They have big mandibles  And they  They can bite your toes  Yeah  I treated an ant bite one time  It bit the person  The heart just  Was fluttering  Dr. Steve  What are you gonna do with that  You wanna  Well that's pretty interesting  We got the edge coming in  But I did bring home  Some  Wheeze tapes  That I thought  You might be  Interested in hearing  You wanted a little taste of this  And maybe we'll do  More tomorrow  Yes 
[02:36:00]  Alright  Um  My pal  Brother Wheeze  Did three tours  Of Vietnam  And he was  He was a grunt  Basically  Three tours  Of the  He was in the shit  He was in the jungles  He was part of  Some shit  Without giving it away  In  The shit  He was in the fucking shit  In country  So what he did  He  He  Uh  Made some tapes  From the field  Yeah 
[02:36:30]  These tapes are  45 years old  It's a young  Brother Wheeze  He's probably  22-ish  Early 20s  Mmhmm  Making tapes  To send back home  About the war  And then  He's pretty  He's being pretty  Fucking honest here  It's good  They survived  The tapes  So this first one  Is um  Him talking about  Stacking bodies  For the helicopter  Brother Wheeze  From 45 years ago  I'll tell you  I wanted to hear  From girls  Over there  So I wanted to  Hear from girls  But on your tapes 
[02:37:00]  The way I enjoyed  The best  Was uh  The tape of you  And the guys  At the merchants  I could understand you  You were just  Telling me  It was great  To hear from you guys  Those girls  At the first  I ain't  You know  They ain't  Nothing man  They ain't  Nothing  Their time  Doesn't get  Anyone you want  You can leave  What you want  Right  Here  Uh  I'll give you  The situation  Here  Uh  First of all  In the last tape  I told you  That we were  Going to go out  On the road  But what happened  Was  The next day 
[02:37:30]  They took six of us  And put us up  On top of a mountain  Sort of a polling team  We stayed up there  For three days  They had a real experience  Up there  I'll tell you about  Right now  It was nothing much  Uh  Uh  We were up there  First night  There wasn't much  Nothing much  Happened  It was a pretty steep mountain  We went up  A helicopter  We dropped off  Didn't look like  Much could get up  There too good  We had triplers  Set around our positions  And a whole bunch  Of claymores out  We were feeling  Pretty secure  And one night 
[02:38:00]  About 1130  We were up  Bullshit  And getting ready  To sack  And all of a sudden  Uh  We were sitting  In a little group  That's all six  Of us  Which was wrong  But you get  Pretty lax  Around here  Sometimes  Next thing you know  Boom  Triplere goes off  Your heart  Goes down  To your feet  Boy  I'm telling you  We got our stuff  In order  We got our  Hitting order  Pretty good  About five  Within five seconds  We blew two claymores  On this  Whatever  Triplere  And felt  She had two  Frags on them  Victoria shot a frag 
[02:38:30]  And that lob  Went over there  And while a hundred  Triplere went out  We just hung tight  For a while  Waited  Nothing happened  We figured  Nothing would come  By  Claymore was out  That's about it  So we waited  Till the morning  We went down  A little ledge  There where  Triplere went out  And found two  Of those  Sneaky  Slimy  Buddies of yours  And uh  Another thing  Anyway 
[02:39:00]  Let me tell you  What we do  With these guys  Let me tell you  What we do  To these guys  You see  In LZ  When you hear me  Talking in LZ  That means  Landing zone  From the helicopter  Sometimes you gotta  Chop one away  For it to come in  Or that's the way  We had it  On top of this mountain  Sometimes  An RTO  That's a guy  That carries a radio  He has a little  Orange pad  He carries  And you put this down  So the helicopter  Can see it  Well we took  These two baddies  And made a T  Out of them  For the helicopter 
[02:39:30]  To come in  You know  Our eyes were balls  And we landed at them  Holy shit  Can you understand  Most of it  Oh yeah  Yeah  That's what  67  68  45 years ago  So you know  A couple guys  You know  Dead  Made a T  So the helicopter  Could land  And take those guys  Out of there  What year did he  Start radio  I don't know  Like  85  Early 80's  I guess 
[02:40:00]  You know  It's a  Great perspective  There  You listen to that  When that was going on  That's exactly  When I was playing  Those drums  Oh really  Brother  Yeah  Wow  He was playing  Little Anthony  He was playing  His drums  And crying  Right  And Brother Weez  Was throwing dead  People around  Yeah  Want one more clip  Because he talks about  The girls  Sex  For a long time  I got a whole bunch  I got about  Seven clips  Some of them  Are a lot longer  Than the one 
[02:40:30]  I just played  This one's  Definitely worth  Playing too  Well  What I was going  To tell you  What I was going  To tell you  Wait  What  Well Rich  I was going  To tell you  Something  I forgot  Oh let me  Tell you  The situation  Here anyway  Nothing  Happened  The next night  Up there  And everything  Is pretty good  And  Well  I'll tell you  A little about  The army  The army  Is always  Messing with you  They tell us  They're going to  Pick us up  One morning  It's raining  Up there  It'll be cold  Pack our stuff  In our red sacks  Wait  Wait  Never come  Stay the next night  Next morning 
[02:41:00]  Call us up  Reading some  Morning C's  We'll be up there  Three to twenty minutes  You know  We'll go three hours later  And we'll not see  Nothing  Then you  We'll get that  A man's mind  Right now  We're down  In the garden  You see  The artillery  Sets up  Out in the field  Here  And we  We've got a perimeter  Around it  This is sort of  Like a rest for us  I told you  We're out in the field  Four and a half month  Almost five  But  We're guarding them  And it's  It's really terrible  I ain't kidding 
[02:41:30]  I mean  There's no  No charlies  Or nothing like that  It's just chicken  Shit  What we call it  We've got two man positions  You got  Right now  I'm in a bunker  There's four of us in here  The ones that aren't  I'm guarding  The other ones  We're just sitting there  Smoking and joking  You listen to your taste  Got a big kick on them  You got to dig these bunkers  The next day  They want you to improve  Improve  All they want you to do  Is work  Once you get out in the field  Fighting child  Or whatever you want to call it  In the car down the line  Well it's hard to explain to you Rich  You see 
[02:42:00]  You don't like being out there  No one likes being out there  Because their life's at stake  And it's really miserable  You get back at something like this  This is what the Cavs is  The Cavs wants you to like being out there  And they make it so miserable for us back here  That we just wish we could be back out there  Because out there  We're at our own  We do what we want  We dress what we like  Well  We can be shabby  But back here  They just stay on you all night  Caught a buddy  Big Bennett  I introduced him to you  In one of the last tapes  They got him sleeping five times 
[02:42:30]  And got him together the other night  I guess they busted him  Yeah  That's what I heard  I heard he's got syphilis now anyway  A couple of the guys  Come down with a clap  Syphilis  Because we're on the green line  They got some boom boom  That's Joey Draymond  The boom boom is  A little code name over here  For you know what  It's pretty  The other thing I want to tell you  I heard on the tape there  Daffinette was saying  You know how you get some  Tail over here  For two, three dollars  But 
[02:43:00]  And they say  You know  Real good  But  It's not even  I'd rather not even  Heard at all  It's really rotten  I can't even explain it to you  These  Gooks  Are the worst  You don't want nothing to do  Out in the field  We can take it for nothing  If we want to  But you know  They have black teeth  That's so loud  That's for real  The teeth are pitch black  From the stuff that they eat  Called beetle nut  I've seen  Let me tell them  Listen to this  Let me tell them 
[02:43:30]  Listen  We've seen  Now you can call me a liar  We've seen guys with no noses  Three, four thumbs  They've got more  Thalidomide babies over there  Than you ever seen in your life  When they grow up  Well  I'm glad I've seen that guy  With no noses  During the day  They've seen that guy  On the beach  Yeah  I've seen that guy  At night  We've been all over  That's fucked up man  You can hear it  Yeah  And it's kind of cool  To hear  Hear like words 
[02:44:00]  That are commonplace now  Because you've heard them  In movies  Right  And documentaries  And what not  But that was the time  So he's saying  You know  Gook  And Charlie  And boom boom  And stuff like that  Frag  Did they say frag  Before the first one  Yeah  You don't hear that much  It's all like  Like stuff  But that was  When it was happening  That's pretty fucking cool  Now the gist of that track  Because some of it's hard  To listen to  Obviously  He was complaining that  You know  He'd rather be in the woods  Because they leave you 
[02:44:30]  The fuck alone  Yeah  They just work you  And make sure  You're all clean  And nice  When you're  When you're not out there  On patrol  Yeah  He'd rather be out  In the woods  Rather be out in the woods  Where they leave you  The fuck alone  And then he was talking  About pussy obviously  Yeah  And I think he'd get  A hooker it sounds like  For two or three dollars  Yeah  But you don't want to fuck  But then he said there  That they could just take women  If they wanted to  As they're out there  But you don't want to  Because all their teeth  Are black from the beetle nut  Beetle nut  Supposedly the beetle nut  Because I asked him about that 
[02:45:00]  It was something they ate  All the fucking time  There's a tumor  They took out of George's head  Jesus  That's what they called it  It's a very rare nut  But I guess they all  Were eating the beetle nut  Because it just gets them high  They all were just high  All the fucking time  And it just makes your teeth  Completely black  Yeah  It sounds great  Yeah  And then I guess  There's a lot of deformed  Fucking people over there  Thalidomide babies  It was kind of funny there 
[02:45:30]  Because he said  They saw that guy  With no nose  And they were happy  That they saw him  During the day  Yeah at night  That would have scared him  Oh fuck yeah  It's hilarious  They were fucking in Vietnam  Right  So that's a taste  That's pretty cool  Was there anything else in there  Pretty much that was it  Right on that one  Yeah  Why did he take these down offline  He should have left them up  He got a lot of complaints  I guess  Why  And I said just put them back up  Complaints from a who  Because he don't care  Who would complain  He don't care  I asked about this 
[02:46:00]  I go  Do you have any attachment  To this experience in Vietnam  Because it's 45 years ago now  And he goes  It's like watching a movie to me  Like he doesn't feel connected to it  Who would complain  Who the fuck would complain  I don't know  I don't know the full story  Maybe  Was it  He said gook  Is there some fucking  Probably all that  Is that it  Oh god  It was what was happening  Right  It's history  You dumb fuck  But then again  Who knows what it was  Yeah  But um  I'll just jump on it  And make like that  Might have been the Black Beetle Society  We might have time for one more 
[02:46:30]  Beetle nut  One more  Is this working  I don't even know  Because I know  I know the quality  Isn't the greatest  Yeah people are having  A tough time hearing it  Fuck  Yeah  We cleaned it up too  Well we were explaining it though  Yeah  Want to try one more  Can't hear it  Yeah  One more sounds  Alright  VC crapping in the road  Food in Vietnam  Pretty easy area down there  There's nothing to it  I don't know  I wish I knew where Max was  I know he's working  Back at some day's camp  I guess go for it  Look  I'd like you to tell me  What Alfred's with 
[02:47:00]  I'm proud  He's an infantryman  It's good to know  Another guy's fighting over here  I see  He's down the area  Triangle  It's pretty good  Now he's down the Delta  That's right  Go for it  Good man  So uh  I had no way I could ever see  Like Joey  See down at 173rd  Just down by Sagat  I don't know  Where they'd get over down there  But  We're under surveillance  Every day  Every night  Those were the times  We were in the field  Carassing old Charlie 
[02:47:30]  So  I mean  There's just no way  I could do it  I'd sure like to see  Old Carvers  I'd sure like to see Max  Another thing  You tell  Old Bill there  That I'm guaranteeing  I'm gonna send him  You send me his address  You listen to this now  You send me his address  And I'm gonna send him  A tooth  And an ear  I'm guaranteeing it to the man  Holy  You can hear that  A tooth and an ear  Huh  What has he said so far  He's looking for some guys  Max  Yeah yeah  He's looking for some 
[02:48:00]  Some of his buddies  Right  And when he finds him  I'll send him a tooth  And an ear  He says give me his address  I'll send him a tooth  And an ear  Jesus  But I'll tell you right  I'm gonna send it  I don't know if it'll work  In C-Rations  There's a little accessory pack  That comes in  The C's  And each accessory pack  Has a little thing  With cigarettes  Four cigarettes  Five cigarettes  Two pieces of chewing gum  Chick-fil-a-type  Little package of coffee and stuff  Well I'm gonna take  It's made out of ten  Like  Ten four  Little baggers 
[02:48:30]  When I get the ear  I'm gonna put it in there  And pour it with salt  And put it in an envelope  And send it to him  You guys  If it gets there  I hope it gets there  If it don't  It'll be a while  Because we're back here  With this damn artillery  Guarding these creeps  I don't know how long  We're gonna be here  We're supposed to be wrestling  We might not go to the field  For another month  I don't know if I can last it  Here  Seriously  Uh  Uh Rich  I keep clicking this thing off  To think of something  That's terrible  Tell your mother 
[02:49:00]  I can't tell her  I don't like her cooking  I sure would appreciate  Some cookies  Now that I'm on the subject  Stick some ravioli  Stick some cans  Anything in cans  Which we eat up over here  Cause anything  You gotta make it  Cause we can make it  Send some raviolis in the can  Man  Chef Bill Ardeen  Will be going crazy for a day  You'll never realize  I mean  I'm so far gone  From the world now  And when I first came over here  I could think about these things  That make  It was so funny to me 
[02:49:30]  To see things  That made these guys happy  Over here  A guy gets  Uh  Uh  You get a good can of seeds  And you're a happy man  You get a package  Ramones  With some pepperonis  In them  And  Your days are made  Man  You know  Back in the world  You just go up to the store  And buy what you want  Um  I can't explain it to you Rich  Wow  What a lousy MRE  They have  A few cigarettes  Two pieces of chewing gum  Yeah  A little coffee  Sounds great  Someone's saying  You gotta google

[02:53:30]  To talk  Maybe we'll talk  To Weez tomorrow  They want us  To talk to them  About these tapes  Let me say hi  To Don in Buffalo  Don  Hey what's going on guys  Hey buddy  Hi  Alright  I had a class  For getting my  Boat captain certificate  And there was a dude  There from Saipan  And he had  The beetle nut  And he would try  To share it with everybody  And he explained  That it's basically  Their version of dip  And when I tried it 
[02:54:00]  Within five minutes  My whole mouth  Was completely numb  I was just like  Drooling out of my mouth  I couldn't  I couldn't take the shit  But did you feel high?  Yeah  Does it give you a buzz?  I guess  It would be for like  Somebody who's never  Smoked a cigarette  Or took a dip  You know  That kind of light headed feeling  That's about how I felt  And how much do you have to do  For your teeth to  Turn completely red  And then black  First time  First time  Nice  He said that  He'd been doing it  For years 
[02:54:30]  And his teeth  Were getting kind of gray  Like all the way up  Through the gums  It was getting kind of gray  But he said that  A majority of his family  Like yeah  Their teeth were black  Or they were just  Missing their teeth  Damn  Alright  Alright  I thought it was more  Of a drug  Where you're a little high  But I guess it's more  Of a  Casual thing  Kind of a cigarette  Slash  Tabackey thing  Yeah  I think we'll talk to  Adam Edge Copeland next  Does he go by Adam Copeland  I don't know 
[02:55:00]  He's probably not allowed  To use Edge  Because I'm sure  Vince McMahon owns that name  Well he's still associated  With WWE  Oh yes  So he's still good  He's promoting  By the way  He is promoting  This Friday  Tickets going on sale  For the June 9th  Anti-social comedy show  With David Tell, myself  Artie, and Nick DiPaolo  It's taking place  June 9th  The MGM Grand Theater  At Foxwoods  That will sell out  And then next Thursday  Through Saturday  I'll be in Orlando  Florida  And March 29th 
[02:55:30]  Through April 1  Here in New York  Caroline  Nice  That's going to be  An amazing show Jimmy  Let's hope so  Oh my god  It's going to sell out  Immediately  Oh I don't know  Don't fuck around  Get your tickets  If you want to go  See that show  Okay  The Edge next  Seriously  XM  XM  This  This is the  OPN Anthony show  Why this song  He rocks  This would be  Edge's theme  Oh oh 
[02:56:00]  Of course  I know that  We got Adam  Edge Copeland  A lot of people  Think we got  U2's The Edge  Coming in  Because I kept  Saying The Edge  But I tried  To explain to Sam  The band is called  Who  But no one says  The Who  I mean no one says  Just who  Oh fuck it  I just fucked it all up  Never mind  My point  You add the  To stuff  When you feel like it  Well you're supposed  To say who  But it's the who  Everyone knows  It's the who  Adam Edge Copeland  Of course  From the WWE 
[02:56:30]  Going to be in  The Hall of Fame  Huh  Oh yes  That's very cool  When is that  Saturday March 31st  American Airlines  Arena in Miami  That's right  So what  They wrestle as  They put the guys in  No  What  There's no matches  Why not  It's an induction ceremony  At an arena  So you get all these people  Who come to an arena  And there's no wrestling  That's crazy  I've been to one  It's crazy  You just go and you see  The Hall of Fame  Is there a ring there  In the middle  There's no ring  What  It's on a stage  It's an induction ceremony  How many people will be there  They'll fill up the arena  There'll be 17,000 people 
[02:57:00]  To watch this  Yeah  Without any wrestling  There's no wrestling  This wrestling thing  Is pretty popular  Why wouldn't they do  The induction ceremony  In the actual ring  And then maybe  They could like  They don't need to  Then you get like  An old wrestler  I still have a beef with him  Like Bob Backlund  Yeah  You get Bob Backlund  Why not  It's a classy thing  Why make it classy  When you can make it cool  Or Sergeant Sloughner  Right  It's not Sloughner  You know that  I want the Hall of Fame guys  Wrestling as they get inducted 
[02:57:30]  That would be different  Than other sports  And  They wear suits  And why not  Yeah  And they can pull each other's suits off  Let me get out of my suit  Because I have a beef with him still  Somebody comes out  And inducts them  They do a speech  And then the person getting inducted  Gives a speech  Who's going to induct Edge  I don't know  Maybe Christian  It's got to be Christian  What about Virgil  He's not doing anything  It's definitely not going to be Virgil  Virgil's not going to induct anyone  Virgil's not even in the Hall of Fame himself  Why  What  That's right  That's dumb  Coco Beware is 
[02:58:00]  Coco Beware  Let's say hi to Edge  No way  Coco Beware is going to  Get in the Hall of Fame  Run  Hey  I know that guy  What's up Edge  I thought we were in commercial  What do you mean you thought we were in commercial  I thought that was a commercial  Hey man  Hey  What's happening  What's going on man  What's going on  Oh yeah  I remember  I remember watching  Absolutely  Yeah  Some of those crazy ladder matches and shit  Still paying for them  I don't doubt it man  Well we only learned today  That you had to retire because of an injury 
[02:58:30]  Yeah  That sucks  I mean it doesn't  It doesn't  You were done  You were ready to move on  I  Yeah  But I actually assumed it would be this Wrestlemania  Because I had a year left of my contract  And whether it's stupid work ethic or whatever it was  I wanted to see that through  Yeah  We finished Mania last year  And I knew stuff was going on  Because my arms were trembling and stuff  And I was like  Shaking and shit  Man  I had neck surgery in 03  So they already put a plate in there  So I knew I was on borrowed time  And what had happened was  The discs had been slamming off of that plate 
[02:59:00]  Every time for the last eight years  You saw me landing  That's what was happening  So it got to the point where I was like  Something's going on  And I couldn't hide it anymore  So they got MRIs the day after mania  And went  You're done  Like you don't have a choice in this  We are not allowing you  We're not clearing you to do this anymore  What was wrong?  I have spinal stenosis is what I developed  Which is a narrowing of the spinal column  So what's happened is my spinal column  Even right now  Because I haven't got another surgery yet  It's pinching my spinal cord  So if you look at it 
[02:59:30]  It's like a straw being pinched  So how do you fix that?  It depends  It depends  It's a learning process right now  If a dentist chair I found out  Destroys me for two days  Just having my head back  Oh really?  Didn't know  Until I went and got my teeth cleaned  Right  And I went  Whoa that sucks  All right  Well I guess I'll  You know  Floss more  Yeah  How do you fix that though?  There's surgery  And it might be another fusion  You know  Where they take it  I already have two levels fused 
[03:00:00]  It would be a third  But then I've heard on that  Are you getting shorter?  I think I already have  Because you're a tall guy  I think I already have  You've got some height though  You're okay if they take another inch  I'll still be 6'3  Jesus  So are you going to go in for the surgery?  Eventually I'm going to have to I think  You know  Because I mean I still like to mountain bike  You know  Kayaking  And I want to still do stuff  And you were ready to leave  You think?  Because you're a young guy  You're not even 40 I don't think  No 38  I was 37 when I retired  But I was preparing myself for it anyway 
[03:00:30]  I was already getting to that point  Where I was like okay  You know  It was a 20 year career too  I mean I started when I was 17  You know  I started in high school  So I knew  From the time I was a little kid  That this is what I wanted to do  So for me  I did everything I set out to do  Right  What are you going to do next?  Well you know  While I was still wrestling  I shot a movie through WWE  I got a part in a TV show on SyFy  Called Haven  And you know  They got a DVD coming out  The documentary of their career  And they're inducted me 
[03:01:00]  In the Hall of Fame this year  So I'm retired  But it  What's cool going forward  Is it afforded me the luxury  To pick and kind of choose  Whatever I do  I'm going to make sure it's fun  Right  God you had some amazing matches too  I can look back and say  I'm poor  That ladder shit  Holy fuck  Who invented the ladder shit  I can swear  Yeah  Yeah  I'm sorry  Should have told you that  Ahead of time  Who invented that ladder stuff  And then it got to get  It got crazier and crazier  For a while  It got pretty stupid 
[03:01:30]  And we were responsible for that  I mean we set the bar  Way too high  Right  You know  But we all kind of  Between  You know us  And the Hardys  And the Dudleys  Came up with the TLC thing  And that took it to a whole  Like  It just looked like a tornado  Through a trailer park  Oh yeah  It was  By the time it was done  What's the ladder match  Okay  Well usually what happens is  There'll be a championship  There'll be a belt  Hung over the ring  And you got to climb a ladder  To get it  And bad things happen  What  Does one person hold the ladder 
[03:02:00]  And support the other  Oh no  No  The other person tries to knock you  Off the ladder  No  I climb up a ladder now though  And I'm just like  Like Spider-Man  No  It always frustrated me  Was how long it took  To get up the ladder  It's like come on  That's the idea  You know  No I know  But the guy is  Literally knocked out cold  Outside the ring  And it's like  It's like get up the ladder  Get up the ladder  It's taking forever  I tell you what though  I change a mean light bulb now  Get up there  I can get up there quick  Did you ever have a ladder match 
[03:02:30]  Where you're thinking ahead of time  This is such not a good idea  Oh every time  Really  Every  Because the ladders got bigger  And you would tip the ladders over  While the guy's on the top  Yeah  And you don't know  Where the fuck you're going to fall  Through tables  All that  You got ladders tipped over  While you were on them  Oh my  Can you imagine  Oh wow  Seriously  You got to google some of this  Oh it's great  And they wouldn't just fall on the ring  The ladder would go over the ropes  With the guy on  It was crazy  On the cement  Yeah  On the metal stairs 
[03:03:00]  There's just  Four tables  Yeah yeah  How do you  Did you guys practice how to fall  No you can't practice that  Really with mats and stuff  I'm just trying to think  So you're just hoping  That you're going to fall  Correctly every time  You're a little bit of a  Physical chemist  Like  Okay  How many bones did you break  Wow  Well my neck  You broke your neck  Doing a ladder match  I think just  Wow  Over time  Yeah it's ridiculous right  Over time I think  It just wore it away  Is what it did  But you know  I tore my Achilles  Tore both pecs 
[03:03:30]  Both MCLs  Fractured skull  You know just  But over time  Right  You know it wasn't just  Like a one time  Oh I just broke my neck  Right  It just wore away  And  But yeah  I pigeonholed myself too  Because I ended up  Being pretty good at these things  So I ended up in 19 of them  Which is more than  19 ladder matches  Yeah  Yeah 19 of those  And like  Most guys have  Maybe had one  Yeah  That's fucking cool man  That was his thing  I would enjoy that  Yeah the ladder matches  Were sick  I would enjoy watching that 
[03:04:00]  You'd enjoy watching it  Yeah  As long as you fell into a pool  Or something  Dude I'm on a three step  Fucking stepping stool  In my closet  I'm teetering and nervous  Watch this  This is like  They're on the top  Yeah  Oh fuck  And there they go  Right through tables  That's not even right  And the refs run over to help  Yeah  Did that one hurt  You guys fell for so long  I've done that  Yeah  Like you'd fall for like  Oh look they're still falling  They're still falling  Yeah  Essentially you're falling  From like a two story building  Where's our old pal Dudley  These days 
[03:04:30]  We haven't seen him in years  Bubba  Yeah  He's down in Orlando  He's still wrestling for TNA  I think he's doing pretty good too  Okay  Yeah  We used to be pretty good friends  With him  He's a good dude  Back in the day  Yeah  He's a good dude  We used to have all you guys on  All the time  How high is that ladder  That's a 15 footer  Right out of the fucking ring  That really is an amazing  Fucking  And you gotta hope  You hit the table  Well yeah  And here's the thing  Hit it  Slide  And now you're shooting  Into the crowd  Right  It's way too hard 
[03:05:00]  So once you grab  See this is just not safe  There's four people on the line  That's not obeying ladder safety  Do you think OSHA  Would have a problem with that  Obeying ladder safety  It's not OSHA code  OSHA  So now four guys on the ladder  Whoever just grabs the belt  Is the winner  Once you have it  Or do you have to get down with it  Once you have it  Just grab it  Grab it  Who invented the ladder match  Did we get that out of the way  I think honestly  The first ladder match  Might have been  In Stampede Wrestling  Out in Calgary  And I want to say  It was Bret Hart  And Bad News Brown  Really  Wow  And I'm a bit of a historian 
[03:05:30]  I think that's what it was  You're from Canada  I believe  Yeah  Yeah Toronto  Did you like Bob Backlund  No  I was never a Backlund guy  I never got with Backlund  I didn't like him either  I don't  I'm obsessed with him  No but I just  His name  Because he was so awful  His name was so awful  Oh Vance  I just  Giving real answers to questions  I didn't have to go out there  And work hard  Shut up  He was howdy doody  Yeah he was a goody gumdrop  Yeah  Nice guy  But  Who's inducting you  Into the Hall of Fame  I wanted to be Christian  And I'm going to assume  That's who it is 
[03:06:00]  Because they asked me  Who I wanted to be  And I said  I mean we grew up together  We really did  We're not brothers  But we grew up together  We did all these matches together  Act like brothers  You know  He's a complete dick  Can't stand him  But I love him  So I think  One of those  Yeah  Love hates  I mean it's all love  But we always just bust each other's chops  Like guys do  Right  Falling on ladders  From ladders  That must suck  To fall off a ladder  And land on a ladder  It's like  Motherfucker  That hurts  There's no good way to do it 
[03:06:30]  I'll tell you that  Have people broken bones doing this  Yeah  Yeah  But it's really more one of those  Like  You just feel like hell  For the next  You know week or so  How bad did they get hit  With a metal chair  It sucks  Dude they're fucking  Just banging chairs  At each other  Like there's no way to do that  Without hurting yourself  And that's not a prop chair  There's a guy running around  And hitting people  With the ladder  In the ladder match  We totally could have done  A Home Depot commercial  Just to prove the strength  Of their stuff  Wow  They really were  Amazing matches  Are they still doing  Ladder matches  I don't even know 
[03:07:00]  They are just less  Less crazy  Yeah  A lot more infrequent  Which is a good thing  Yeah  Who else is going  Into the Hall of Fame  It's me  Four horsemen  Ron Simmons  Who is in the APA  The damn  And Mike Tyson  Is going in the celebrity wing  Really  Yes  Which should be interesting  Wow  Why  So  Man I don't know  What to expect  It's still kind of surreal  To me  Yeah  I mean I was  I was still doing it 
[03:07:30]  Last year  And not even a year later  You know  They're putting me in  And I think I'm like  The youngest person  To ever go in  So it's kind of weird  Yeah yeah  Surreal  That's cool though  Humbling  I mean it's  Yeah it's fucking cool  You earned it for sure man  That's weird swearing  Okay  Is that Bubba Ray Dudley  That's D-Von  That's his  No no no  That's the black guy  The white guy with him  Yeah that's Bubba  It is  We met him  I remember  He used to the show  Yeah he came on one time  He said  He drove me to Long Island  Once in his limo  Oh really  I think he had a limo  For a day  And wanted to show off 
[03:08:00]  He's like  Hey I'll drive you home  Fuck that train shit  I think he was the first  Wrestler I've ever met  No no no  When I was  I think I met  Magnificent one  Don Morocco  I saw  Oh good old Don  The beach bum  Yeah  He was awesome  Intercontinental champ  We're obsessed with Virgil  On this show  Virgil  Virgil's an interesting cat  We're obsessed with him  Really  Because no one  No one gets his autograph  At these  At the shows right  Sam laughs  Sam goes to all the shows  And comes back with  The latest picture of Virgil  Just sitting there by himself  Bless his heart 
[03:08:30]  Have you met Sam before  Well we just met  I've never been on the show  Sam's an uber  Sam is probably  The biggest wrestling fan  I don't know anyone bigger  I really don't  He knows everything  About you guys  Are we doing well Sam  Because I don't know  Yeah you're doing very well  Is there something  We're supposed to be asking  No I do like  The concept of a ladder match  Had to be explained  I didn't think  I thought everybody was aware  Of what it is  But Jim  I thought it was  Jim never saw  Watching Jim go  They're falling off 
[03:09:00]  Of ladders  On to ladders  Here's the thing  I love how you had  To stack up tables  Let's see  We're going to stack up  Three tables today  Seriously  We were like  You know  The home designing  Scientists  It was just like  Yeah  When did you feel  When did you finally feel  Like we don't have  To top ourselves anymore  Or did you never feel that  I don't know  If you ever feel that  I think if you  You always want to  Try and top yourself  But then you realize  You know  Right  Physically  There's got to be  A limitation 
[03:09:30]  And was there something  You really want to do  That you never did  No  With the matches  No  Actually I can look back  And I'm going to go  Okay that was ridiculous  That was cool  And even just from  The career standpoint  It's like  Anything I wanted to do  I did it  Right  So that's why  Having to retire  Was a lot easier  And plus them telling you  You got no choice  Made it easier too  So you were  You were sort of ready  It sounds like  Yeah  You sound like  You're almost relieved  I kind of was  I was mentally  Preparing myself  For a little bit  You know  The road kills you guys 
[03:10:00]  That's the hard part  You know  And it sounds like  You know  Kind of rock star  Different city every night  Da da da da  But it's tiring  You know  How many days a year  For you  In your prime  250  Jesus  How do you take  A chair to the head  I can't get over this  Your teeth  Dude  They're leaping  Even though  Like you know  That they're falling  Like you know  They're professional  How the fuck  Do you fall on a guy's neck  Even if you fix your leg right  Where it doesn't hurt a lot 
[03:10:30]  You gotta trust  It still hurts a lot  Of course it does  These fucking guys  Jump you up the top rope  Why don't you try it out Jim  Play it down on the floor  No  You want to  You want to put you  In a movers on  I'd love a woman to do that  Off the top rope  On my face  We got it  But 250 days a year  Yeah  And they're not putting you up  In the best fucking hotels  All the time  We're putting ourselves up  So it's up to you  How much money you want to save  Yeah  So a lot of you guys  Would pick the real cheap  Fucking accommodations  One of the things  I always told myself  It's like man  The bed I sleep in 
[03:11:00]  Is going to be important  And the fuel I put in my body  You know  The food I eat  I'm going to make sure  I try and do it right  So those are two things  That I always made sure  That I didn't  I didn't scrimp on  So Nick Foley  And you never stayed  In the same place  I love him  He's been on the show a lot  He's a good friend  He talks about how he  Sleeps in fans' houses  And stuff  Just to save money  Here's the thing  It's like  I was not stupid  I didn't go out  And buy Lamborghinis  I mean I drive a pickup truck  And I drive a jeep  Right  You know  But my houses are paid for  Right  So it 
[03:11:30]  I could imagine  Some of you guys  Checking into a real cheap  Hotel or motel  And the people are like  What?  I was just watching you last night  Why are you here?  Yeah  Well there was this one night  We got to Detroit  And there was a blizzard  And everything was sold out  And there was seven of us  And we went  Well I guess it's seven of us  In a room  And it's like me  And Jericho  And you know  A bunch of guys  There was actually  They had taken the air conditioning  Unit out of the wall  So there was a hole in the wall  And we're all in there  Going  What are we doing?  Why wouldn't you have  Advanced reservations? 
[03:12:00]  If you're going to Detroit  So many things change  Oh  Or like you might not  Get all the way to Detroit  Because it's a long drive  And you're just beat  So you go  Okay well I'm going to stop  In I don't know  Ann Arbor or something  Or Lansing  You know  So you never fully knew  You know  Where you're going to get to  And a lot of you guys drove  Yeah  Yeah  To save money too  Yeah  So you guys would carpool  What they would try and do  And what they still try and do  Is like at least book it  So that it's fairly close  And it's usually not  A flight every day 
[03:12:30]  But you know  When we were really watching  In the late 90s  We just assumed you guys  Were on fucking private jets  And five star hotels  Eating at the best restaurants  What does a low level wrestler make?  Like a guy who's not  Who's known  But not on your level  But kind of a quasi famous guy  Who's just doing matches  Around the country  Yeah  Honestly I don't know  You know  When I first signed with WWE  I was one of the first guys  Like on a developmental contract  Where it was like  Okay kid  We see something  But go get experience 
[03:13:00]  Wherever you can  So I'd go to Japan  And all these places  And just try and keep  Gaining experience  And they would pay me  210 US a week  Because that equaled  300 Canadian  200  A week?  A week  You know  And then you know  The first contract I signed  I think was  You know  For 75  But that's  75,000?  Yeah  But that's your base  So if you're on every show  You destroy that  Right  So it's incentive based  In that respect  Where it's like  Okay if you do good  We'll put you on every show  You're getting paid for every show  So you're going to clear that 
[03:13:30]  You know  Maybe within three months  Or something  Why was it your responsibility  To get your accommodations?  I never understood that  And we've talked to so many of you guys  Why wouldn't the WWE  Take care of all that?  Have a whole  You know  Department  Dedicated to  Making sure you guys  Are traveling properly  Well we have a travel department  For the flights  And everything like that  But what it did kind of do  Is I think  It keeps you grounded  You know  You're responsible for it  You know  You're not on a private jet  And everything's catered to you  And all of those  What am I  A den mother?  They could do it themselves 
[03:14:00]  Oh Vince  Strong  Yeah  Vince don't play  Yeah we'll leave the light on for you  What do you want  Your mommy?  Yeah  You need a night light  You sissy  But here's the thing  It's like  None of us get pampered  To the point where it's like  I can only have Fiji water please  You know  Please you know  Make my coffee with  You know  Icelandic  You know  Frigid temperature 
[03:14:30]  You know  I get it  But between what you're actually doing  And what they could have done  Maybe somewhere in the middle  Somewhere in the middle  What wrestlers got the  The high end treatment though  Like the first class  The rock probably  At the time  You know  If you make it to the top of the show  You're going to do okay travel wise  Did you after a while  Like they fly you first and stuff?  Yeah  You know  And if there's no first  Then they buy me two seats  And you know  So it's  You go on Vince's plane sometimes  Yeah  Yeah  I mean  When did that stop though?  I was taken care of 
[03:15:00]  But when does that stop?  Because now you get up to that point  And then one day he's got to go  Yeah  You might want to  Get a carpool going  I think I got out  Before that happened  Okay  How embarrassing would that be?  Got it on top  You got your bags  You're assuming that you're  On the plane with Vince again  Yeah  Wait what happened?  Not this time pal  This is great  I'm waiting for you  See you in Minnesota  What's your favorite moment  To watch wrestling wise?  Not including yourself  But like what's something  That you like to watch?  Yeah I don't know  There is so many 
[03:15:30]  Is it the shock master?  Because that's mine  Shock master  Shock master  That's what I want to go for  Is the brutally bad stuff  That's what I want to watch  You know  Just there's so many  Bad promos  And clips  And things like that  That I really do get  A kick out of watching that  It's so bad  I still feel like  It might have been  Done on purpose  No  No I know  No  No or like even  Like last Monday  With Rock and Cena  That was awkward  And you can feel  Why  What happened?  What happened to Sam?  But Rock's out there  Cutting a promo  And he had some writing 
[03:16:00]  On his wrist  And Cena called him out on it  And you could visibly  See the bristles come up  Like and it was  It was really awkward  Like they don't like each other  But to me  That makes for awesome TV  Wait you mean  He wrote down notes?  I wasn't there  But that's  That's what he called him out on  And what did he say to Cena?  No Cena said  You know  I don't have to  Write my stuff on my wrist  And Rock  For a guy who was  Never off his game  He was kind of  Off his game after that  So it was like  Either he's an incredible actor  Which you know  Might very well be the case 
[03:16:30]  I saw Tooth Fairy  Hey is this clip online?  It probably is  Here's the thing too  I love both guys  So you know  You see it  And it's like  Ooh  Ooh  There's some stuff going on  Rock is wrestling  Yeah  Wow  Exactly right  The guy didn't need to  Vince knows how to  Throw money at you  And you know  Brock will probably  Wrestle again  If his health will allow  I'm sure he will too  Probably  You know  And here's the thing  A lot of people get upset  You know  Rock's come back for a match  I say  Why get upset about it?  It's good for business 
[03:17:00]  The guy doesn't need to  And here's my thing  It's not taking a spot away  From  If you're good enough  You're not going to get  Knocked off the show  You're going to be good enough  To stay on the show  And that's up to you  And if you  You aren't good enough  You're going to be off  That's your fault  Is John Cena good on the mic?  Yeah  He's really good  Yep  Come on Rock  Come on now  I got something for you  Some cold hard cash  Get in the ring boy  Come on  I love the fact that  Vince's music  Oh yeah  It's got it  Has to  Complete the whole scene there 
[03:17:30]  Unless you got the walk too  Oh yeah yeah  With the flailing arms  I love  I love when he walks out  From the back  And walks down the aisle  He's just kind of  You're right  His arms are kind of flailing  With a tailored suit  But it's pink  Pink  And just a huge  Monstrous man  Underneath it  Yeah  Yeah  It looks like a bottle  Of Pepto-Bismol  You've got to respect him  For all the bumps  He took over the years  Oh yeah  Oh not afraid  Billionaire taking bumps  In the ring  Yeah I mean  He asks you to do something  It's like  Well he'd do it  Yeah 
[03:18:00]  What is this  He's finding it  He's finding the part  Where it's good  When  Obviously it gets real at times  Do you guys  You know  Fucking  Hurt him a little bit  Nah  Sometimes in those matches  Just get back at him  No  Just twist a little more  Than you need to  Or anything like that  You've got to be pro  Even in the end  When you're  You know you have a real  Beef outside the ring  Yeah you've still got to be a pro  Because I mean  Tough  You can really get messed up  In there  Yeah  You know  So you're not  You know  That's not something  You want to do  That's like  That's a code  That you don't break 
[03:18:30]  You know  Here's Cena  Calling out Rock  Wow  The Rock  This is too much fun  I was not going to miss this  I mean  You actually referred to me  As Kung Pao Chicken  Kung Pao Chicken  Only The Rock  Could refer to me  As Kung Pao Chicken  It's genius  It's absolutely brilliant  Because every single 
[03:19:00]  Chinese restaurant  You go to  It's always there  It's perfect rock  And this  Is perfect rock  The rock comes out  Does his shtick  Holds the millions  In the palm of his hand  Like only the rock can do  But  I must admit  I didn't come out here  To swing for the people's strudel  Or whatever you call  On your penis nowadays  I came out here  To tell you  You were right  You're right  I am that guy 
[03:19:30]  I'm the guy  Who runs you down  When you're not here  But as usual  Just like everything else  You're only half right  Because I'm the guy  That runs you down  When you are here  You see  These people  Love The Rock  I was one of these people  Until I got to meet  Dwayne Johnson  Dwayne Johnson 
[03:20:00]  Is a self-centered  Egotistical  See-through  Son of a bitch  That wouldn't give a rat's ass  If this company  Closed its doors  Tomorrow  Now I'll tell you  Something Jack  I don't need words  Like respect  And loyalty  To Trent Worldwide  Just like I don't need 
[03:20:30]  My notes  For my promo  On my wrist  Just changed  Nice tattoo  Oh man  So here's the skinny  April 1st  When the millions  See John Cena  Versus The Rock  John Cena  Is going to be  Eyeing up  Dwayne Johnson  And I don't like  Dwayne Johnson  You probably  Make your boobs bounce  There'll be a thing  On your eyebrow 
[03:21:00]  That looks like  The people's eyebrow  But I'm going to be  Looking into the eyes  Of Dwayne Johnson  And see a man afraid  Because you're going  To be looking at  A dude who may not  Have balls  But a dude who's  Going to beat  The hell out of you  At Wrestlemania  Jack  So he didn't talk  And why didn't  The Rock say anything  He did after  And it was  Well that's the part  We wanted  Not the five minute  Sam  Wouldn't we want the part  Where he's all  Like nervous now 
[03:21:30]  Sam what do you  Got called out on  What are you doing  There leaving  In the parking lot  It was fucking awful  Not nervous  Just a little flustered  A little flustered  And for right  He's never flustered  Is he still good  Can I hear a little bit  Of The Rock  I don't know  Well see but this clip  He's kind of flustered  In it so you're not  Going to get the true  Well that's why  I want to hear  Because we've all  Seen The Rock  Not flustered  A million times  Like I said  Could just be  A great actor  Do they like  The Rock  These people  Yes  Why are they cheering  To the guy  Talking shit to them  A bit of both  They like him too  Yeah  It's like you John  It's like you to come out  Run your mouth 
[03:22:00]  And then walk away  Before I slap the lips  Off your face  And I'll tell you what  It doesn't surprise me  You come out here  Now you confuse the world  You don't like The Rock  You like Dwayne Johnson  Hate Dwayne Johnson  What you good  Let me tell you something  John you're back  They're listening right now  You're back  They're listening right  Let me tell you this  John  The Rock  Dwayne Johnson  Dwayne Johnson  The Rock  That is the same man  That is the same man  The same man in here  It's the exact same man 
[03:22:30]  Out there  He still is  The exact same man  The exact same man  John  But the difference  Between me and you  You come out here  You run your mouth  About being tough  You ain't tough  I know it  And you know it  The bottom line is this  The Rock  Dwayne Johnson  Dwayne Johnson  The Rock  The people's champ  The great one  The most electrifying man  In all of entertainment  It doesn't matter John  It doesn't matter  The only thing that matters  And you're back there  Listening  Is that what I'm gonna do  On the biggest stage 
[03:23:00]  Of Wrestlemania  The biggest match  Of all time  The Rock  All the nicknames  You wanna throw  Team bring it worldwide  We're gonna kick  Your candy ass  All over Wrestlemania  Hit you some man  He ran it back then  He got back to it  Yeah  It got tense  Yeah  What was  Who's the best mic guy  I think  Of all time  I say Backland  Backland  Rock is up there  Obviously  Rock's definitely up there  Stone Cold was amazing 
[03:23:30]  Was Hogan good or no  Yeah  Yeah but it was  A different era  Yeah different era  Yeah era  Who do you think Sam  Who else would you  Put in that category  You got two biggies  Right there  Was Jericho good  On the mic  Yep  Jericho's very good  What Jericho did too  Is he like reinvented himself  And changed even  Not only you know  How he would wrestle  And how he looked  But his style  He's a good talker  Right  Yeah  Yeah  I mean there's a lot  Of good guys  Generally the guys  You see talking  Are good at it  Right  They're talking for a reason  Sure  And Cena's considered good 
[03:24:00]  Yeah  How come those guys  Don't like each other  I don't know  I honestly don't know  But watching that  I don't think they like  Each other  Do you think John Cena  Is like jealous  Because he's just  Coming back  And making a lot of money  After he's just  Going and doing movies  I think that's probably  A lot of guys  Think that way  And I don't think  They look at it  The way I look at it  I look at it  From Vince's perspective  You know  It's like man  That guy doesn't  Got to come back  It's going to help  The product  And get everybody  Else noticed  And like I said  If you're not on the show  Because he bumped you off  Then you're not good enough  It's your own fault  Right 
[03:24:30]  Well we ran out of show  Unfortunately  Damn it  That's very interesting  I used to watch wrestling  A lot  Then I kind of stopped  And I discovered  Sexual addiction  But I still  I find this shit  Fascinating  Absolutely  CM Punk is good right  On the mic  Or is he not  He's good on the mic too  Yep  He's pretty real  Yeah  Yeah  And now with all the Twitter  I find Twitter  Very passive aggressive though  Oh man  I'm going to type  Bad things about you  It's really just  Childish  Are you on Twitter 
[03:25:00]  No  Oh you're not  No  Not at all  If I got a problem  With somebody  I'll tell them face to face  I'm not going to type about it  Are you recognized everywhere  Yep  That's cool right  Yeah  Yeah  And the cool thing is  Everybody's usually pretty cool about it  It's like man  I saw you did it  That's nice  You're on TV for 20 years  It's going to happen  Right  Yeah for some reason  Our fans love to bitch at us  All the time  Holy fuck  Are you really a fan  I'm confused at this point  How about a little love  Every once in a while  Oh my god 
[03:25:30]  I'll give you love  I had fun  All right good  The Edge  The Edge  Bending the rules  Is you played  Oh thanks  Yeah I guess I should plug  We haven't plugged that right  What is Bending the rules again  It's now Friday limited  Yeah it's a movie  I did for WWE films  I shot it while I was still on contract  So it was kind of cool  Because it gave me some experience  As to what acting kind of was  But I don't consider myself an actor  By any means  I just  You don't want to do more acting  I will  Right  But I'm not going to be one of those guys  That's out pounding on the pavement 
[03:26:00]  Or anything like that  You know it sounds  It probably sounds like a dick  But you know if it falls on my lap  I'll do it  Good for you  You know  Is this fun  It really is  It's hard though  See here's the thing  I had fun my entire adult life wrestling  So if I do something  It's going to be fun  I don't want to do something  That feels monotonous  And as a job  Hey where's Shane  He texts me on my birthday  Gets me every year on my birthday  What happened  Remembers every year  He's got enough  He has a reminder  Probably  He's got enough  Edge's birthday  Jimmy blown up Edge's spot 
[03:26:30]  He doesn't remember  Man I thought he cared for me  What happened with Shane man  I don't know  He just didn't want to be  In the family business anymore  I guess not  I honestly don't know  You know  We never really talked about it  We'll just  You know  She walked away  You know  There's got to be a story there  That no one's willing to  I'm sure there is  To tell  You know  And I'm sure  He'll be the only one  That knows it  Yeah  He manages Rory McIlroy  McIlroy  Yeah that golfer kid  He's the number one  In the world now  22  Second youngest ever 
[03:27:00]  Never golfed  Yeah exactly  He's in  Yeah he's managing  Wow  And one of his clients  Through his company  Is Rory McIlroy  That's a damn good client  Number one golfer in the world  Good one to have right  Yeah  But I want to know  Why he left the family business  We all want to know  It's tidy here  And one more time  Just jump off the top rope  And hit the table  You hit that table hard  Make you sell that  All right  Dad  Jesus  Just looking  Anything  Please  Anything else  It's one thing  If your dad wants to take bumps  But to  Yeah 
[03:27:30]  But to force your son  To do it  Fuck  Well what choice do you got  I know  I just broke his tailbone  Through a table  I guess I got to  I have to do that  Dad  Not the stink face  Dad  No  No  Hey  The stink face  If you suck in a match  What Vince tell you  Does he tell people  Like you didn't do this right  Or you didn't do that right  Oh yeah  But here's the thing  With Vince  I was like  Man you can't lace up my boots  You know  You don't have an athletic bone  In your body  I'm not going to take your criticism  Have you seen him walk to the ring  I've seen him wrestle 
[03:28:00]  He's got guts  But he cannot wrestle  So you know  But I mean  He'll tell you  Like he's obviously watched  Enough matches to know stories  And you know  What's good and what isn't  He's entertaining as all  Oh yeah  Now we're hearing that  Edge has to go  So bending the rules out  Friday limited  We'll check that out  And then of course  The induction in the Hall of Fame  That's cool  Congratulations on that  Thank you  I know it's a big deal for you guys  Saturday March 31st  At the American Airlines Arena in Miami  I'm thinking you guys should  Fucking wrestle a little bit  As you're being inducted  What do I know 
[03:28:30]  Oh man  If I could  I'd wear like a  Huge flannel lumberjack tuxedo  And just grow a big massive beard  With birds nesting in it  But I'll probably have to do  The GQ beard  Yeah yeah yeah  Alright  Adam Edge Copeland  Come back and see us  Alright  Cool thanks guys  Thanks for having me  And Jimmy  You're good with your plugs  Yeah tickets go on sale  Friday morning  For my gig with  Artie Lang  David Tell  Myself  Nick DiPaolo  That's June 9th  In Foxwoods Casino  And then I'll be at  Caroline's at the end  Of this month  Very cool  Thank you  See you guys tomorrow 
[03:29:00]  The Opie and Anthony show  Is pretty much over  But if you feel like  Sticking around  After ONA Live  Is next  Sirius X out  Hey hey hey  And now  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  This is  After ONA Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Yes yes yes yes  After Opie and Anthony  Live  How exciting was that  For everybody  Edge  WWE superstar  About to be a  Hall of Famer  On the Opie and Anthony 
[03:29:30]  Show today  Very exciting  Very exciting  The Hall of Fame  Ceremony is on  March 31st  That's Saturday  In the American Airlines  Arena in Miami  So uh  If you're going down  To Wrestlemania  Or if you're in the  Miami area anyway  And don't have tickets  Why don't you go ahead  And get yourself  Some tickets  Because you know what  What else are you  Going to do  It's going to be  An exciting night  Uh everybody's  Cleaning up here  Um  This  I don't know  You know  Obviously I was 
[03:30:00]  Very excited about  Edge  But at the same time  Running through my  Mind all day  Ever since  Ant brought it up  Was the battle  Between ants  And human beings  Um  I feel like  Cats the size of  Ants  I'm sorry  Ants the size of  Cats  We don't hold a  Chance against them  And I mean  You could take  Your strongest  Human beings  Because I feel like  An ant  That's the size  Of a cat  Could not only  Hide in places  But could lift up  Tanks  And once you're 
[03:30:30]  Strong enough  That you can lift up  A tank  You're pretty much  Unstoppable  And there's more  Ants than human  Beings anyway  So that right there  And you'd have  The same amount  Of ants  They'd just be  Much bigger  It's not like  We'd just say  The same surface  Area amount  Of ants  No it's the same  Number  Because if you're  Talking about  Surface area  You'll be fine  But that is  Something we  Discussed today  Uh uh uh  Lisa Bonet  Being nude  Like Christina  Hendricks  Is something we  Discussed today  We talked about  Intervention today 
[03:31:00]  Um  It was a great show  It was a very good show  Paul  Paul you're here  Where's Paul  There he is  Paul's coming in  But you are not  Keeping track of  These people  Eric  Paul is actually  I'm not in charge  Of Paul  Who is  I don't know  He's just kind of here  Did you hear the interns  Talking shit about you  Yesterday  No what happened  They were just saying  Well I asked  Intern Eric  Who does more  For the show  Paul or Sal  And he said 
[03:31:30]  He said Sal  Okay  Um  What's up  One of these  A few minutes  Earlier  Yeah yeah yeah  That's cool too  We got some stuff  Going on here  I'm gonna throw it  To a bit in a minute  But um  Uh  How does that make  Why is that  That the interns  Are under the perception  That Sal  Is the man  Because did you hear  Yesterday's show  No  It was great  It was great  I would recommend  Going to Audible  And downloading it  You gotta hear it  Okay  The whole  You probably realized 
[03:32:00]  It was going on  Behind the scenes  But the whole  Club Soda Kenny  Versus the interns thing  And Sal not going out  For food orders  And somebody going  To management  And this whole thing  Exploded  Really  Into a big mess  And it was great  It was great  Sal are you over that yet  You took it kind of hard  No that was  I'm still like  Fatigued  From yesterday  Are you  Yeah  It's a thing that happens  Where  You then start questioning  Getting on a mic again  Because you don't know  When there's going to be 
[03:32:30]  Another implosion  Very traumatic  How many food orders  Did you go on today  Uh  None huh  No  Let's say a couple  You did  Yeah  A lot of people  Wanted food today  Well it was just  The other dude  Came late  So  Eric came late  Oh yeah  After talking shit  About me yesterday  He came late today  Do you want me to  Count him  Well I didn't know  Eric was coming late  Now we just had  A discussion with him  Yesterday about how  He was the dumb intern  Right  And now he's coming late  Paul  I'm sorry I even brought  You in here into this mess  Because I didn't know 
[03:33:00]  We were dealing with  A tardy intern  Yes  Eric  Yeah  What's going on  With your guys  Well he was texting  Me all morning  And then sent me a link  To  I see him rolling  There he is  He sent me a link  Eric we're talking  About you being late  Yeah  Stay in here  This news piece  That he was on his train  And the train broke down  Oh yeah right  And that while he  While he was waiting  For the rescue train  The rescue train  Broke down  Yeah come on  That's a lie  Eric  We just had a discussion 
[03:33:30]  Yesterday about you  Being a weaker intern  Right  Yes  And then you show up  The next day late  That's a very  That's a very  If I could use  An old intern's name  That's a very  Love buzz move  Well I must say  You know what I mean  Listen  I you know  I don't have weaknesses  In my internship  Because I showed strength  Through keeping everyone calm  Our train broke down  I was on there  For three hours  You didn't need to keep  Everybody calm  You don't need for the MTA though  Yeah exactly  You didn't need to keep  Anyone here calm  Because I just found out  You were late just now 
[03:34:00]  Nobody knew you even  Our train  Listen  It was all over the news  If you were watching  The local news here  Yeah  Trains were cancelled  Out of New Jersey  It was chaos  Well I think you have  Something to say to Paul then  Because you talked a little  Shit about Paul yesterday  But then you  I did not  You didn't  You didn't say that  Sal was better than Paul  I didn't say Sal  Was better than Paul  You asked if I saw  Sal doing more work  Than Paul  And that is only because  I follow Sal around  You see him  Doubling  I do yeah  That's not doubling  That's you know  That's backing up my statement 
[03:34:30]  If you follow Sal around  How come you sat in that room  Behind me for the last  Two and a half hours  Well um  Oh you're not even  Following him well  You got some shit  To work on buddy  Well I'm working on  Something right now  You know  What are you working on  I'm doing some drops  Doing some drops  Helping him with some drops  I don't know  Right  Hopefully it's at the  36 story window  Oh  Yeah  Fingers crossed  That's messed up  You don't think so  That's messed up  Well um  My other favorite thing  That we talked about yesterday  Was uh  Ant's 
[03:35:00]  Phone attachment  Uh  That Harry T  I ran into Harry T  He's a kid  Who interned in the same  Opie and Anthony class  As I  Yes  I was once an Opie and Anthony intern  A lot of you guys  Are looking at me like  No that can't be true  Look at you  Yes it's true  Way back when  In the long long ago  That's right  That's exactly right  That's exactly right  Sex man  Way back when  Um  And he ended up  Producing Ron at Fez  And then he moved on  From that job  Or I don't know  If he quit or got fired  I don't know  What his deal was 
[03:35:30]  But um  He ended up  Just pursuing comedy  And I guess now  Also selling  Uh  360 degree  Camera attachments  For iPhones  I don't know where  Those two worlds meet  But somewhere they did  Uh  I wanted to bring  Everybody  More on board  With who  Harry T was  I didn't get a chance  To do that yesterday  With all the malarkey  That was happening  So I thought  Uh  We would do that today  Eric  Which Harry T gem  Of I think the two  That existed  Did you pull out  There's only one 
[03:36:00]  That's just the one  Okay  That's the one  Okay  And that would be  Uh  The time  And I believe it was  Travis was the one  Who saw the computer  Uh  That Harry was caught  Sending his own instant feedback  In to request his own material  Alright  Let's hit it here  On After Opie and Anthony Live  After Opie and Anthony Live  So he's gonna say  Even better  Hey  That  That is killer man  Is this true  It's completely  Confirmed  And  Everyone's so excited  Old school movie 
[03:36:30]  About Travis  Yeah  Well someone has to explain  They're just handing this to us  Travis you want in on this  It's um  Instant feedback  You know our instant feedback  It's a great little tool  For the show  People are able to comment  On uh  Things uh  Uh  Going on during the show  Without having to get through  On the phone  And we read them here  And sometimes we read them  On the air  They're very funny  Sometimes they're just  Comments to us  Saying they love the show  They hate the show  Sometimes  They request bits 
[03:37:00]  Is what they do  And uh  I was handed  Um  The ONA show  Live feedback form  Now this is  A printout  Of what people  Um  Who go to instant feedback  Uh  Have to fill out  First name  Last name  Email address  From  And then the message  A max  250 characters  And then send it  Boink  Well this is  Um  From uh  Joey  Last name  Gay  Email address  Shitdick at 
[03:37:30]  Aol.com  From  And it says  Whackbag  Dot com  And then it says  I like that  Led Zeppelin  Tribute  With Robert Kelly  Singing lead  Play the Rob Kelly  Remix with  Zeppelin  And apparently  Our uh  Private investigators  Around uh  The studios here  Have found out  We observed  That uh  This  Was being sent  From a cubicle  Here in  The XM studios  It's coming from  Inside the studio  And um 
[03:38:00]  By observing  They have found  That it was indeed  Harry T  The new intern  Requesting his own  Material  Trying to request  His own shit  Under an assumed  Name  While he's  Interning  While you're  Interning  You're requesting  Your own  Stuff  I  Now  Is this  Yeah  Oh no  I'm  Passing up  Yeah  It was  It was more  Because  Towards the end  Someone else  Threw one in  Oh you played  The other Zeppelin  One  I'm like

[03:39:00]  Could find out  You too  You did not  Really  That's why  This kid  Flew the plane  I was just  Testing security  Just seeing  What the hell  The beers  And everything  Didn't matter  Wow  Wow  That real  You know what  That kind of  I'm getting a douche chill  Reeks of desperation  A little bit  It does reek  Of desperation a bit  I don't deny that  We complimented you  On it  It was very funny  But you know  I don't think  You can just  Rest on that  No I know  I don't expect to  But I thought  I'd just try 
[03:39:30]  I just think  You kind of  Tossed it in there  Hoping we would  Play it  And then go  Oh and by the way  That was done by  Harry  Oh yeah  There was no denying  Harry great job  And stuff  So you're not even  Denying any of it  No  No  I got caught  That's it  You got caught  Yeah  I'm gonna plead guilty  I like the Zeppelin tribute  With Robert Kelly  Singing lead  Play that Rob Kelly  Play the Robert Kelly  Reader  And even put W  Slash Zeppelin  Right  You know like a regular Joe  Yeah  And Joey Gay  Shit dick 
[03:40:00]  Well Joey Gay  Is an actual  A real guy I know  He is  Is he really  He's a comedian  Yeah his name is Joey Gay  Joey Gay  But it did  Theoretically get me in here  So I can't say  That it didn't work  Did not work completely  Well taking a shit  On the desk  Would have gotten you  In here too  I mean that doesn't  Necessarily mean  It was a bright move  And from Wack Bag  Well that's  It's automatic  That would help  No it's just automatic  If you don't put something  In there it just says  From Wack  Like I went through  Wack Bag  Yeah  Like that's why  A lot of the posts  Save  Is that a default  Kind of thing 
[03:40:30]  That just pops in there  Martini Steven studio  Steve  Steve  Steve  Yeah  Is this on  Yeah okay  It looks like they  Copied the code  And put it on their own website  That didn't come from  Obeananthony.com  Oh it didn't  No  No I went through  Wack Bag  That's the only way  Oh you did  Yeah  You do know the interns  Are not allowed  To go on to Wack Bag  Yes  Yeah hi Pete  I'm on the radio  How are you  No posting allowed  I don't post at all  I was just looking  For the instant feedback  I didn't know how to find it  Things like posting  On the Wack Bag  For interns  Things like 
[03:41:00]  Even IMing other people  No I'm not a  Sending private messages  To other people  Through Wack Bag  None of that  Is really accepted  I'm not a big  Internet poster  Dude did you put  This one here  Play some cuts  From Yellow Discipline  It was from  EAB.com  I wonder what that is  You can't request  Your own stuff  Under an assumed name  This is very uncomfortable  Isn't it  If you would have  Signed it you  Like from Harry  Our intern requesting  His own material  From a cubicle out there 
[03:41:30]  Oh it's creepy  Wow that is  Really creepy  That's a good word for it  Creepy  Oh  What are you doing Travis  Huh  Oh good  Check instant feedback  Jesus Travis  What are you doing  Oh you're not here  Travis is not here  Everyone's waving  Off the plane  We gotta make believe  He's not here  It's a different  Now that we just  Acknowledged that we're here  Now we have to make believe  He's not here  What was  5 foot 11 infant saying  What were you saying  Nothing 
[03:42:00]  I didn't see  I'm  Not 5 foot 11  How tall are you  6'2  You're not 6'2  Don't even start that shit  You're not 6'2  This has been an ongoing thing  With Steve and I  There was  Back in the day  Before we got Club Soda Candy  And Master Poe  You know  Anthony and I  Were doing this popular radio show  And we felt like  We needed security at times  And you know  Martini Steve  Was doing production and stuff  And before his stomach stapling  He was what  400 pounds  400 pounds  Yeah  400 pounds  And he looked like 
[03:42:30]  He was 6'2  6'3  Okay  Yeah  Well he gets the stomach  Staple surgery  And he loses 150 pounds  Something like that  He's down under 3  Way under 3  Yeah 270  And he also decided  To stop wearing  His platform shoes  Anthony  That made him 6'2  The guy's  Not even taller than me  Well I'm a little bit  Taller than you  Back in the day  We felt like  We were being protected  By this monster  Turns out you were wearing  Platform shoes  That gave you 3 inches  Well I used to wear  Still no one would  Screw with him  Yeah I wouldn't  I wouldn't exactly  Consider myself 
[03:43:00]  Meek at the moment  I mean  Do you think you could  Kick Steve's ass  No of course not  Yeah exactly  But it's all about  Looking intimidating  And you know  All of a sudden  He drops down 3 inches  And drops 150 pounds  He's not as intimidating  As he used to be  Maybe there was like  A quarter inch of fat  On the bottom of my feet  Fat feet  Yeah  But the  You know  But for many years  I'm just assuming  That Steve was that much  Taller than me  And one day  Walking on the sidewalk  I'm like  What the fuck  You're as tall as I am  I just can't believe  How offended you are  I wasn't consciously

[03:45:30]  Is that intern  See we're in an eyepatch  Wow you're going way back  We might have to tell the eyepatch story again  We get creepy interns from time to time  The eyepatch guy  Well there was Luca that we nicknamed her Luca  Because she came in with black eyes and stuff  And  She was always beat up  And then one day she just never showed up again  We still have no idea what ever happened to her  Just disappeared  Just disappeared  And then there was the eyepatch kid  Who  Yeah  Who missed a few days work  And then came in with this crazy story  Brian  His name was  He was in an accident or something  Yeah yeah  He came in late 
[03:46:00]  And  And  He was wearing an eyepatch  And we asked him what happened  And he said he got into an accident  And as we questioned him  His story fell apart  Much like the  Owl-eyed  Runaway Bride story  Just  Crumbled  Under  Under questioning  He said he was on a motorcycle  When the motorcycle hit the car  Yeah  Yeah  The motorcycle hit his car  And the glass from the passenger window broke  And some went in his eye  And we're talking about  How did  How did the window break 
[03:46:30]  If the motorcycle hit the door  And  And then he said  Well the guy  Kind of fell off the bike  And his head hit the  Yeah I don't remember exactly  But nothing  But he was trying to clean  He had glass in his eye  And then he had kind of like abrasions around his eye  Yeah  And then we finally got him  To take the patch off  He kept saying  No my doctor said  No don't take it off  Probably one of the most  Uncomfortable moments  Yeah  In Opie and Anthony history  He took it off  To reveal  Absolutely nothing was wrong  With his eye  Or anything  And then he's still trying to lie  He's still working 
[03:47:00]  Like no right here  Look  Right here you see  Right here  There's  And well  The redness went away  But I still can't quite see  And he was just lying  Through his teeth  Just like the investigators  With the runaway bride  Yeah  Were like Brian  Brian  There was no accident  Right  No accident  None  Right  And we actually fired him on the spot  Because it was like  Way too creepy  Yeah  That's different  With this guy  That was like  Ah Harry  Harry's fine  He'll stay here  But we'll look at him now  A little different  The Brian guy was creepy though  Because it was after he  You know  Missed a couple days of work 
[03:47:30]  Or whatever  Yeah  The eye patch  Harry's just a jizz bag  It's the worst  The Opie and Anthony show  Let's meet AJ  Poopy shits  Poopy shits  Here we go  Oh no  Hi I'm AJ Poopy shits  I love chicks  And I love tits  It's my favorite part of chicks  That's why I love  The Opie and Anthony show  And their wow sticker promotion  You just log on to the website  Get yourself a sticker  Throw it on the back of your hoopty  And you get to see some great chicks

[03:51:30]  I mean get real  He just loves tits  Well he's gotta keep the catchphrase  But don't you think her tits are saggy by now  AJ Poopy shits  I guess they're a little saggy  I mean they could be better  Yeah  But they're certainly better than like something on a guy or something  And you don't like guys right?  Oh no I mean  Guys being guys and stuff is cool  But chicks is where it's at for me  Married man Mr. Poopy shits  I'm playing the field right now actually 
[03:52:00]  Playing the field  Just trying to get as many chicks as I can right now  Yeah  It's been going pretty well  Yeah  Great  Why don't you tell us about the last time you had sex with a woman?  Oh my god  It was great  It was this chick  She was so hot  She had like blonde hair and these great tits  And I just got to play with them  And maybe like tweak their nipples a little  And just do all these great things to her  And she was so into me 
[03:52:30]  Sounding a little too much like Sam  I'm not looking at you  Well  AJ Poopy shits  What's happening to you?  I don't know who Sam is  This is AJ  And uh  Wow he really sold it that time  I don't know who Sam is  Do you like anal with these girls?  Oh I'll do anything with it  A chick  That's a chick  What's your favorite part of a chick?  Oh  Oh it's the tits  Come on  He's kind of dancing to the music a little bit 
[03:53:00]  Alright AJ Poopy shit  So uh  Explain this bit  The morning's a bit of the day  With this hot Britney Spears  Well I guess this bit is about  This is uh  Britney Spears  That piece of ass that she is  Doing a commercial  For Campbell's Chunky Soup  Chunky Soup  Really?  Yeah  Yeah it's like a parody  But I don't know why 
[03:53:30]  We have to sit here  Talking about soup  And Britney Spears  Let's get to the tits  Alright let's get to the tits  Hey y'all it's Britney Spears  For Chunky Soup  They say Chunky  Feels you up right  And that's good  Cause lately  I've been filled up  All wrong  By that  K-Fan  F***ing son of a  Mother  F***ing  I hate that bitch  F*** him  He's such a  F***ing piece of  White trash  So anyway 
[03:54:00]  Chunky Soup  Has a couple vitamins  And minerals  I'm not even sure  What they are  But  But then again  So does this  Cigarette  Something else  That tastes like cigarettes  My ex-husband  Can't fan that  Mother  F***ing  What a  F***ing low life  Leaving his children  For me to take care of  And I don't even know  What I'm doing  I'm on  Hooked out on drugs  And drinking alcohol  And walking with no  F***ing shoes on  Chunky Soup 
[03:54:30]  My kids love it  When they're drinking  What are they drinking?  Bourbon  I told you  Nothing but Chris style  My kids are better than that  You little suds of a bitches  Chunky Soup  Fills your dumpy  White trash ass  Upright  So you can go  And stretch yourself  Out in public  Y'all  Oh  I don't have panties on  Mm-mm  Good Campbell's  Possibilities  Oh  Does anybody remember 
[03:55:00]  Lasker?  Shame  Shame  Shame  Shame on you  Goddamn rich cunt  That's terrific  That's terrific  Wow  And that's being played  On a lot of stations  Huh? 
[03:55:30]  Oh sorry  That's  That's good  Huh?  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could  I knew that you could  AJ Poopy Shits  What'd you think of that?  Well I mean  It was not funny  The song was alright  That they were playing  In the background  But just  I mean  My favorite part about that  They only really  The redeeming quality  Is  You get to picture  Britney Spears  You know what I mean?  And what  Like what would you  Picture about Britney?  Oh just everything  Her curves  Like it comes 
[03:56:00]  Right up to her tits  I just  Of course  I just love those  Don't you guys?  Oh yeah  Yeah  Hey we love tits  But AJ Poopy Shits  You say that you love  Tits so much  It's a little suspicious  Because  Yeah  If you  If a person didn't know  Much about women  They probably would go  For the obvious  Which would be  That they love tits  What else do you like  On a woman  Besides the tits?  Well I like a woman  With like a nice ass  Or something like that  Good thighs 
[03:56:30]  Pretty hair  Like a nice mascara  Or something like that  To bring out their features  Mascara  Do you like  Do you like their shoes?  Oh god  If a woman is wearing  Awful shoes  They just  Have no shot  With AJ  I will tell you  That right now  Alright AJ  Let me let you  In on something  Yeah  Men  Yeah  You know  Men  Like us  Like most of us  Yeah  We don't look at the shoes 
[03:57:00]  Really?  Nope  You guys are missing out  On a lot  I mean  I think chicks  With tits  Buy shoes  To show off  To other chicks  Yeah  Well that's not  They're not doing it  For the men  Because men in general  Do not look at the feet  Unless you have  Like a foot fetish  Or something  Well yeah  That's what I have  A foot fetish  For chicks  Right  That's why I'm looking  At the shoes and stuff  Because I have a foot fetish  I love women's feet  In a sexual 
[03:57:30]  Heterosexual way  Sexual  Heterosexual way  Well  I gotcha  Now AJ  Poopy shits  It seems like you've  Banged a lot of broads  Oh tons  Where's the G spot?  Oh it's right like  Right around the pussy  Like  Right  It's right around the pussy  Right like  Under it  Okay  What do you mean under it?  It's like  It's really hard to describe  And I think like 
[03:58:00]  A lot of chicks  If you've been with  As many chicks as me  You know that  It might vary  From chick to chick  Yeah  Yeah  But it's right around  The pussy area  Right around  I mean dude  If you don't know  Where the G spot is  Yeah  Then maybe  You haven't been  With a lot of chicks  Oh  And that's to me  Face  That's suspicious  But I asked you first  I know  But what I'm saying  Is it's suspicious  That you don't know  Where it is  I know where it is  Alright then tell us  I told you 
[03:58:30]  It's right around  That area  Yeah but where?  Like right around  Where the pussy  And the clit is  Give some advice  To the guys out there  How do they find  The G spot on a woman?  And how do they  Work that G spot?  AJ's having a little  Trouble with the G spot  Because Sam  Doesn't know where it is  I don't know  Who Sam is  People are saying  Including T  Plev  From Staten Island  That poopy shits  You like 
[03:59:00]  Very large clits  That you like  That you like  Extremely large clits  Oh sure  The bigger the better  Because there's  More to love  That way on a chick  What's the biggest clit  You've been with?  Probably 8 inches  I mean  When you've been  With as many chicks  I'm saying  That they will  Vary in size  And I know  That that sounds  Uncommon or whatever  But they can get  That big really easily  Especially when  They're turned on  Yeah well  People are also saying  That you like 
[03:59:30]  Chicks  And their dicks  Dude that's crazy  Because chicks  Don't even have dicks  That's guys  They're thinking of  And I don't like  Guys in that way  Convince us  You don't like guys  How do I even need  To convince you?  We're just guys  Being guys  And talking about chicks  I mean  That's all the convincing  You need  I like tits  On chicks  What else would I  Even be talking about?  That is so gay  That you guys  Want to even talk about this  Whoa whoa  Throwing that gay word around  Well we're guys 
[04:00:00]  We can throw around  Words like gay and tits  But they don't really  But they don't go along  With each other  No not really  Gay and tits  I know  They're total opposites  One is definitely  Not even close to the other  And I like tits  Alright  Enough about the tits  He likes tits  Do you like tits  Or do you love them?  I love them  Yeah  What do you do  What do you do  With a tit?  Oh  I'll like  Kind of massage it  And caress it  First  And then start to like 
[04:00:30]  Kiss it  And suckle on it  Yeah  Uh huh  And then that really  Is something that  Gets them so turned on  Yeah  And then  I'll like  Show them my stuff  You know  And then put that  Near their tits  And they eat that up  Huh  Oh  They sure do  I mean  Hey uh  AJ Poopy shit  So what's your favorite  Sexual position?  Well definitely  I mean it's just a bunch of guys 
[04:01:00]  Talking  You know  Guy stuff here  Yeah  We're just talking about chicks  Having sex with chicks  I like doggy style  Oh yeah  I definitely  From behind  Why would you like  Um  It from behind  In particular  Because  Nothing wrong with that  No because that way  You could reach around  And grab some tits  While you're going for it  That's what I really  I mean too  He sure likes those tits  Who doesn't?  But it also  When you  What guy who doesn't  Right?  That's what I'm saying  Except one of those guys  Well  Yeah 
[04:01:30]  But when you're doing  A doggy style  It's also a way  To cover up a lot of things  That you might find icky  Like what?  Like tits?  I love them  Tits  Pussy  No  I start  I grab all that stuff  When I'm doing a doggy style  I just reach around  And grab all that stuff  You just grab all of it  All of it  All of it  I just love it  Yeah  All the chick stuff  Just the chick stuff  Right?  Your voice  I gotta tell you  Sounds a little 
[04:02:00]  Effeminate  Yeah  What do you mean?  Like it sounds  Like a feminine voice  Like if you were  A guy  That was feminine  You would talk like that  But dude  Let me tell you this  If you can chick  Trick a chick  Into thinking that you're sensitive  Or something like that  Not that I am  But if they think you are  They will so  Let you see their tits  So much easier  Really?  That's all it takes  If you can trick a chick  Into thinking that you really like care 
[04:02:30]  Or whatever  Right  And she'll think you're sensitive  So  She'll let you see her tits  So you don't try to get into their pants  You try to see their tits  I'm saying  The tits  Yeah  The tits are the first thing  Yeah  And then you can get into their pants later  But definitely in the same night  Yeah  Same night  That's what I do  Because I'm a roller  Do you ever reach into a girl's pants  And say to yourself  Wow  There's something missing here  Like what?  Oh I don't know  You know  I've never said that  Unless they don't have underpants on 
[04:03:00]  Or something  You never reached around  And went  Whoa  Something's missing here  You know what I mean?  I don't think so  Not unless  Unless if they're not wearing underpants  I'll say wear your underpants  But other than that  Totally not  You're like  Ew  Icky  It's smooth down here  What do you mean of course?  Well yeah  I guess I do like a little more hair there  That's my personal preference  You like the hair around the what?  Around the labia  And the pussy  Oh so you know those areas  Yeah  And you don't like hair around the asshole right? 
[04:03:30]  Oh no way  That is gross  But why would a chick even grow hair there  Is what I'm saying  I don't know  Why don't you tell me AJ  Poopy shits  Well I don't know what kind of chicks  You've been with  But the chicks I've been with  Are totally not in that league  No  No way  And you like big tits?  Oh I love  I especially like big tits  But like all tits  I really love  I mean to me  Tits are one of the most fabulous things  On this earth  Right  And where do you go to pick up your broads? 
[04:04:00]  Oh I'll go to like the tavern or whatever  To the tavern  Yeah you know  Tavern  Like a sports bar?

[04:04:30]  I love football  What do you like about football?  Oh just the guys passing around  The pig skin like a couple of men do  Yeah  Yeah I mean just because  They're just guys being guys  And plus you get to see all the chicks  That are so into them  Which is good  Do you  Are you a fan of the wide receivers  Or the tight ends?  Uh  I guess I prefer the tight ends  As far as football players go  That old gag  That old gag indeed 
[04:05:00]  What do you guys mean?  You don't know the first thing about football  We've talked to  Uh  Someone that sort of sounds like you  About football  And that person didn't know shit about it  Well this is  And if we're gonna be guys  Just hanging around  Talking about uh  Football and tits  You should know a little more about football  This is my first appearance on this show  And I know football  And I know tits  Alright  How many yards  Uh  Does it take for a first down in football?  Oh  I don't pay attention to all that  Mumbo jumbo  Technical stuff  Leave that for the bookworms  You know what I mean?  Well what do you like about football then?
