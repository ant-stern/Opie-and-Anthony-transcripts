<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, primarily revolving around sexually explicit humor and personal attacks directed at intern Noah 2.  The show began with a "best of" segment focusing on Noah's expensive clothing (Italian suit, Bruno Molli shoes), his perceived wealth, and speculation about his sexuality.  This segment, hosted by Anthony Cumia and Sam Roberts, along with Danny, Nathaniel, and Jimmy Norton, involved crude jokes, sexually suggestive comments, and even included Danny attempting to get Noah to wear women's clothing (a pink teddy and sparkly jeans) for money.  Noah's dating history was also subjected to skeptical questioning and sexually suggestive remarks.

The discussion about Noah's sexuality continued with guests Bob Kelly and Gavin, where hypothetical celebrity sexual partners were suggested (Jude Law, Matt Damon for Noah; Brad Pitt, George Clooney for Kelly).  Noah's song, "Julia," was harshly criticized, and homophobic language and slurs were used. The segment culminated in Noah reading from "Rent Boys," a book of gay erotica, as a form of intern punishment.

Further segments featuring Opie and Anthony, along with E-Rock, Sam Roberts, and former intern Francine, continued the theme of Noah’s perceived homosexuality. This included Noah reading from "Rent Boys" and a Penthouse Forum letter, with  Opie throwing a chocolate-covered strawberry at Noah’s Gucci boot.  Opie's own impoverished childhood was contrasted with Noah's affluent lifestyle, explaining Opie's animosity.  The segment ended with Noah resigning from his internship due to the constant harassment.  Throughout these segments, frequent homophobic slurs and vulgar language were used.

A shift in the show’s focus occurred with the arrival of Stephen Adler (Guns N' Roses) and Chip, promoting Adler's new project, Adler's Appetite. The interview with Adler covered his past drug abuse, experiences on *Sober House*, legal battles with Guns N' Roses, his relationship with his mother, and his perspective on other band members, particularly Axl Rose.  Eastside Dave (Ron and Fez show) also contributed to the chaotic, sexually explicit conversation, which included graphic descriptions and jokes about sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  A photo of Madonna's pubic hair sparked a discussion about body hair and aging.  Adler recounted anecdotes about past girlfriends and a bandmate's infidelity.

Another segment touched on the changing image of rock stars, contrasting older musicians (described as tattooed and eating veggie burgers) with younger artists.  This led back to Eastside Dave's enthusiastic visit, featuring a guitar rendition of "Mr. Brownstone" for Adler.  The conversation then moved to unusual funeral experiences, with hosts and callers sharing anecdotes including broken caskets, dropped coffins, and inappropriate behavior at funerals.

The show concluded with a discussion focused on Bob Kelly’s persistent attempts to contact Sam Roberts,  including graphic and homophobic speculation about their imagined sexual encounters.  Derogatory terms ("twink," "faggot") were used, and  a previous internet video of Sam playing a "Creepy Gay Kid" character was mentioned.  The segment also joked about the hosts' perceived shared physical characteristics.  Travis was mentioned as being present in studio during this segment.

[00:04:30]  but I am not Opie.  I am Anthony.  I am Anthony.  And this is Prime Time Sam Roberts.  There is no Opie and Anthony today.  Well, there is no live Opie and Anthony today.  But Opie and Anthony today.  But E-Rock and me are here in the studio playing some of the best or worst bits in the last several years of Opie and Anthony.  We probably shouldn't put all that stuff.  We probably shouldn't put all that stuff in front of us coming on the show.  Hindsight is 20-20, E-Rock.  Well, since you and I are hosting, we went through the archives, found some good stuff. 
[00:05:00]  And what we are going to start off today's show with is one of the most requested bits.  Well, yeah, I will say bits for now, but it is more of a saga in Opie and Anthony history.  It hasn't been heard in a long, long time, Eric.  It has not been heard since 2005.  It is one of the most memorable interns in Opie and Anthony show history.  That's not Sam.  Well, I mean, people don't think of me as an intern anymore.  I'm a big star now.  But it's also one of the first interns, one of the earlier ones from 2005, is Intern Noah 2. 
[00:05:30]  Now, for those of you who have been with us maybe since the beginning of our satellite tenure,  Intern Noah 1 was the intern that banged a porn star that Jimmy Norton didn't get to.  Intern Noah 2 was the intern who came in with very expensive clothing,  was trying to be a pop star, and had strawberries thrown at him?  That comes up a little later, but yes, that is correct.  In this segment here is a little montage of random times that Noah was brought into the studio 
[00:06:00]  so we could discuss his very outrageous outfits.  It's the how to not be an Opie and Anthony intern.  The saga of Noah 2 begins right now on The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to The Worst of the Opie and Anthony Show on The Virus, Sirius XM.  This blows fucking monkey cunt.  Where did Nathaniel go for food?  He left at 4.30.  He's sitting in there, so I don't think he's getting food anytime soon. 
[00:06:30]  I think they sent New Guy.  Yeah, the guy with the...  New Guy, Noah, yeah.  Why is he wearing a suit?  Oh my God, he looks like a boss.  Yeah, it's Eric Holder.  All right, get him in here.  Hold on.  He looks like Eric.  He's Lil Elo.  Steve.  Enlo.  Or N-O.  Did you get Jim's food yet?  Dude.  Oh my goodness gracious, my man.  You know, I know you're trying to make a good impression.  What's your name again, bro?  Noah.  Oh yeah, Noah.  Noah's read all the manuals, I think, on what to do in the workplace as an intern to better 
[00:07:00]  his chances of moving forward in the business.  And I guess one of those things said, wear a suit.  Well, I guess I'm trying to look more like Prince, like you said last time.  Yeah?  I don't know.  But you're buttoning two buttons of the suit, which makes you look like you're on trial  for child pornography.  Nobody buttons two suit buttons.  That's true.  That's the new way to button the suit, though.  Only cooks do that.  Why the suit, really? 
[00:07:30]  Why the suit?  I don't know.  You know, the rest of the interns are going to beat the crap out of you.  You know that, right?  Oh, I know.  I probably know that.  I'm going for a look, I guess.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You figure that was a nice professional look for this environment?  We're going for a look.  Look around the room.  There's no one in here that would care about a look.  Yeah, we...  Absolutely.  To see someone walking around in a suit makes us a little nervous around here.  You know, us on the show, we don't really like the suit guy thing.  When they walk around, it just means we're in trouble or something.  Danny, break out the pillowcase. 
[00:08:00]  Break out the soap.  Break out the pillowcase and get the bars of soap.  Someone needs an attitude adjustment.  Yeah.  Well, no, it's very good that he's thinking that way.  Really?  It's professional.  Making us all uncomfortable.  When was the last time you saw a suit?  If you're interning at IBM or something, that's, you know...  My brother works for IBM, actually.  Oh, really?  Yeah, coincidentally.  Got to get those fish fillets down to those boys at IBM.  Did they send you for my food?  Yeah.  You got it?  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you very much.  Oh.  So what are you waiting for?  No, he's just being...  Food's on its way.  It's on its way?  Yes.  On its way.  Oh, oh, it's outside.  Yeah.  All right, well, chop, chop.  Oh, I will.  I like this kid.  He's got the look.  He does.  Thank you.  Very tussleable hair.  Strapping young man.  Wearing a suit.  What kind of shoes is he wearing today?  Nathaniel, get in here.  Nathaniel's really bothered by them.  What are they?  Are they the loafers?  And Danny, get in here.  I want to see if these guys have learned anything from us. 
[00:09:00]  Bruno Mollies?  Bruno Mollies.  You're wearing O.J. murder shoes?  Yes, I am.  I kind of respect that.  Wow, that's nice.  You know, the kid is...  Yeah, it's not just a suit.  It's a really nice suit.  Like, you come from money or something.  Yeah, I think he does, because he was wearing a nice jacket the other day, a nice coat.  I'm not going to say anything, but yeah.  Yeah, you come from...  Your parents have money, right?  They take care of me, I guess.  All right.  Yeah.  Here's Danny and Nathaniel that have been working really hard for us and barely get mic time  because they don't come in here with suits on. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, if I just dressed like a freak, I'd be in here all the time.  Sweet.  Sweet.  Okay, so maybe I have a scheme.  I don't know.  So what do you think of the new intern?  He looks wonderful for a high-class pimp.  What, what, what, Danny?  What?  Don't take a pussy.  Wow.  You think he's kissing a little too much ass, don't you?  We don't really like interns that come in here and kiss ass.  We hate that.  I think he's going about it the wrong way.  Really?  Yeah, I don't think you guys are the suit. 
[00:10:00]  Look at us.  You want to go far here?  Dress like a tranny.  That'll get you far.  Most of us have hooded sweatshirts on.  That's our luck around here.  There we go.  Hooded sweatshirt and a Metallica t-shirt.  Metallica t-shirt on.  Nice.  I guess I try to stand out.  I don't know.  I kind of like this suit, young man.  I think it's a good look for you.  I appreciate it.  I appreciate the compliment.  Like a young executive.  Yeah, young man on the go on the subway.  I'm going for it.  Yeah, it's good.  All right.  What, without getting into any details, if you don't want to,  what industry, business, is your father or mother or parents in 
[00:10:30]  that's important to this lifestyle?  His father's getting married this weekend.  Oh, really?  To a supermodel.  Oh, okay.  What business is your father in?  My dad's in truck business.  In the trucking business?  He owns a truck dealership.  Oh, no.  Oh, a dealership.  Yeah.  Oh, a dealership.  He's not mafia.  Out in Philly.  Yep.  Out in Philly.  Okay.  Truck dealership.  So he does very well?  Yeah, that's okay.  Yeah.  And you still, I mean, is he supporting you?  Yep.  So he pays your bills and everything? 
[00:11:00]  Pretty much.  I don't work besides this, so.  You can just do this and wear a nice suit.  Boy, man, these interns want to just chew you up.  I didn't want to shank you.  Can I punch him now or should I wait until we leave the studio?  I think we should wait until we get outside.  Shank him in the exercise yard.  Please.  Wow.  Wow.  That is kind of messed up.  It really is.  Nathaniel's here busting his ass trying to get a comedy career going and he's got to dress  like a, starring in an episode of Hee Haw.  And you come in here in this fine suit. 
[00:11:30]  Fine suit.  Probably your dad probably gave you a freak truck, didn't he?  No, no.  No?  Got a car, though.  He bought you a car, though.  Yeah, of course.  I got a car.  Did your father fit the bill for that suit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What kind of suit is it?  It's an Italian suit.  Italian suit.  I don't know the name of it.  I don't know.  Why is our intern in a really expensive Italian suit?  Italian suit.  And then the Bruno, uh, Bruno Molli shoes.  Can Steve film a little bit of this so we can get this?  I think we should.  Well, this is what it is.  Well, check the tag on his suit. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, let's see the, uh, take a look at the...  It's some name I can't pronounce.  I don't know.  What, uh, uh, food delivery?  What is it?  Messagerie?  It's pronounced massagerie, I think.  Massagerie?  Yes.  Oh, feigning ignorance, it sounds like.  For someone who couldn't pronounce it.  He sure corrected dumbbell quickly, didn't he?  I don't know what the name is.  Massagerie?  It's massagerie, you idiot.  Low life, no class, jerk off.  So basically, basically if you weren't interning for us, you wouldn't hang out with any of us, 
[00:12:30]  right?  You would have a whole nother...  I wouldn't say that.  I don't dress like this to school, so...  To school?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  So I wear jeans every day.  Ooh, jeans.  Yeah.  What's your major in NYU?  Broadcaster Nelson.  Oh, you do...  You want to get into radio?  Yep.  Okay.  Totally.  Totally.  All right, that makes a little bit of sense.  Do you want to be a program director, or...  I haven't thought about it.  You're dressed the part.  I haven't thought about it.  You're dressed the part as the killjoy in the business.  I want to start calling him Mini Elo.  He looks exactly like little Eric Logan.  You're a little Elo. 
[00:13:00]  You're going to go far in this business.  You just got to grow your bangs a little longer.  Make sure they're straight across your forehead.  Yeah.  Can you drink?  Of course.  All right, you're in.  Awesome.  Can you wake up at five and just do a shot and then go to work?  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Little Eric.  Definitely.  Mini Elo.  Oh.  All right.  We're very bothered by you, to be honest, but...  You're an odd little man.  You really are.  These guys...  I don't think you're going to be bonding with Danny anytime soon.  Look at this.  Danny wants to kill him.  We ought to see if he's really good.  Can you plan a day of inane meetings? 
[00:13:30]  Probably.  See if you really fit the bill.  I probably can.  Leave the suit on button.  The last person to button a suit like that was Ratso Rizzo.  I'll leave the suit on button.  Before he pissed all over it.  Just took a rest that wasn't on the schedule.  I won't wear the velvet jacket again, I promise.  No?  No.  Well, we look forward to what you wear tomorrow, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, and we'll all take the young guy out to a round of Cosmopolitans after the show.  All right. 
[00:14:00]  You Cosmos.  Delicious and pink.  Fabulous.  Thank you, Than.  Thank you, Danny.  Thank you.  What's your name again?  Noah.  Noah.  Thanks.  Even more gay than the last.  Mini Elo.  Noah.  Noah, someone said.  Oh, he nailed him.  I think it was Big Cam.  He goes, it's safe to say the new Noah won't be banging any porn stars.  Jeez.  All these little assumptions being made.  God, he's an odd little fellow.  He really is odd.  He seems pleasant enough.  He certainly does. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know what his deal is.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I can't really figure that one out at all.  He's a young go-getter, is what they call that.  Yeah.  It's okay.  Wears a three-piece suit to intern the Opie and Anthony show.  Not just a three-piece suit.  It's like a really expensive suit.  Yes, it is.  I love that he corrected you when he pretended he didn't know the name of it.  Right.  He's embarrassed by the fact that he's well-to-do.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Eric's not, I don't like the clothes you're wearing today. 
[00:15:00]  Where's your velvet blazer and open shirt?  Danny has to come in because Danny doesn't like the, like, Danny's not going to come in?  No, I think he said because Danny doesn't like you were saying, and he was shaking his head no, agreeing with the not liking.  Danny.  Danny.  Morning, fellas.  Do you want to describe Noah, the new intern's outfit?  I can't even see him right now. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, you haven't seen it yet?  Well, not really.  I just kind of ran in and didn't look too much at him.  Noah's our new intern who showed up last week in a really expensive three-piece suit.  He's new Noah, not old Noah.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, with Bruno Mali shoes and a Gucci belt buckle.  He's an intern.  Well, today he, I don't know what he's wearing.  He's got a velvet blazer on.  He's got a college shirt on with the collar up. 
[00:16:00]  And the problem we're all having is that the shirt is unbuttoned pretty much to his belly button.  It's unbuttoned pretty low, showing his bare chest.  He's dressed like Robert Loggia in Scarface.  Oh, very good.  God, I was trying to figure it out.  That's a good one.  Dope.  Not a hair to be found on his young chest.  No.  You will be molested.  I don't have my sound board.  I know, we have no sounds today.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Yeah, okay.  Danny, what do you think of his outfit? 
[00:16:30]  And it is an outfit.  It's an outfit.  It's an outfit.  Pretty flammy.  But you know what, I did kind of anticipate no one would be overdressed for today's festivities.  So I took the liberty of bringing in an alternative outfit for him to put on.  Oh.  And maybe that'll be a little more comfortable for him.  Oh.  What did you bring in?  Something more like you would wear?  I think so.  It was a little dark, getting everything together.  Let me go grab my bag of goodies.  Oh.  Wow, Danny brought in a bed, Anthony. 
[00:17:00]  The interns are coming to the table, as they say.  Oh, my God.  Well, Noah's getting the attention that it looks like he's looking for.  That he craves in life.  That he isn't getting from home somehow and has to.  We have to bring Noah in here.  Noah, come on in.  All right, Danny, go ahead.  What do you got?  Well, let's check it out.  Mm-hmm.  Got his little Noah bag.  Gee whiz.  You know, I feel so stupid. 
[00:17:30]  It was really dark when I was getting all this together.  And I think I may have gone into the wrong drawer.  All right, Olivier.  What are you?  Well, I thought maybe he might look pretty.  Oh, Jesus.  What are you doing?  Well, this is probably more comfortable.  He probably feels more comfortable in something like this.  It's a little pink, maybe a little spaghetti strap.  Spaghetti strap tank top.  And if he doesn't like that one.  I believe they like to call those, it's a teddy.  It's a pink teddy.  Is it a teddy?  Or he could maybe wear this one.  Oh, God.  That's a little.  If he likes that one a little better. 
[00:18:00]  Looks like from Frederick's or something.  Did you go through your sister's drawer?  Yeah, where'd you get this?  My girlfriend's old stuff.  She don't wear anymore.  I really don't think.  How old is she?  Eighth?  That stuff is tiny.  I wish.  And these flared jeans.  Flared jeans.  Flared jeans.  And little sparkles on it.  Yeah.  With little bedazzler things on it.  So.  I don't know.  Darius runs to Starbucks so you can go and wear this instead.  I don't know if that's really up my alley yet.  I'm sorry to say.  There you go, Missy.  Why don't we want to see?  He just threw girl jeans at him and a pink teddy at me.  They're girl clothes. 
[00:18:30]  What is he?  Is this like Queer Eye for the Straight Guy or something?  No, this is Straight Eye for the Queer Guy.  Now, you have to admit something, Noah.  Okay.  Your attire, especially today, is not something that you would normally see on a straight male.  Did you look at that this morning and think, like...  Well, not necessarily.  No?  You see rock stars dress like this.  Rock stars dress...  Like Mick Jagger and... 
[00:19:00]  Like I said, straight guys wouldn't...  No.  Yeah, I understand.  But rock stars are given a certain latitude.  For their clothes, you know, sometimes the androgyny, they play into it and whatnot.  I'm just saying that for a normal guy, an intern working on a radio show, I think it's pretty clear what hetero clothing is and what homo clothing is.  And I believe that classifies it as homo clothing. 
[00:19:30]  But I like to have my own style.  It's not about sexuality.  It's just about style.  It's a good style if you're on your way to host Dance Fever.  What I don't understand is...  Good style if you're a governor of Jersey going to the podium to announce something.  Anthony and I can't even have style at 9 o'clock at night.  No.  Let alone 5 in the morning.  I mean, you think style this early in the morning?  Yeah.  That's a problem.  But the style itself... 
[00:20:00]  I could see thinking style.  Even your suit, you know, though a little strange for an intern on a radio show to wear a suit, is still...  It's a guy thing, you know?  We're kind of, you know, a bunch of dopey guys sitting here.  And then you saunter in kind of wearing something that...  But, I don't know, normally you wouldn't see a heterosexual guy wearing.  But don't I stand out from it, don't you think?  Well, yes, you do.  I'll give you that.  I'll give you that. 
[00:20:30]  A little bit.  Well, maybe that's the point, then.  All righty.  I'll accept that.  See?  All right, we can accept that.  But can you just button up a little bit?  Yeah, did you make a conscious effort of unbuttoning your shirt so low?  Not really.  I mean, I wear it like that sometimes.  You have the chest of a little Loatian boy.  Why would you show that off?  You're not exactly built or buff.  You don't have to button it up to the neck top button.  I mean...  Yeah, we want to get a little peek.  Yes.  Oh, God.  A little glimpse of your pink skin.  Yeah, keep your neck exposed untouched by a razor. 
[00:21:00]  You don't need...  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with these rhinestone jeans.  I don't know.  I'm sorry they're not up my alley.  Can you do Danny a favor, though?  Maybe, you know, put the clothing on for the next break?  Just try it.  If you don't like it, you don't wear it.  How much do I get paid to do this?  If you want to stand out, that sure is the way to do it.  That would make you stand out.  How much do I get paid to do this?  I mean...  As an intern?  I mean, you know.  It's all free.  It's all free.  To wear...  Maybe Daddy will give you some money.  Oh, wow. 
[00:21:30]  Is he just angry?  I don't think my dad would give me money to dress like this.  I don't know.  No?  No.  He's trying to get him to dress like...  Not to wear a...  I think it's a little odd that he wants him to dress like a girl.  Yeah.  Not to wear a pink tank top and...  Yeah, you ever wear anything like that, a pink tank top or anything?  No, I hate to tell you that.  You ever dress like a girl for Halloween?  No, I've never had.  No?  Never had.  Just wondering.  Did you carefully pick out those colors?  Like, ah, no, this won't go with his eyes.  Yeah, did you turn something down first? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, I'm questioning Danny.  I mean, like, you know...  Your motives are a little strange there.  I don't think I've ever wanted to see a guy dress in girls' clothing and bring the clothing  from home.  This outfit looks pretty coordinated.  It looks like you put a lot of thought into it, you know?  I don't know.  Well, my girlfriend picked it out.  You sure about that?  Well, I mean, how can we prove that?  How can we prove that?  You want to sniff my dick?  Noah? 
[00:22:30]  And wait, also, how do we know it's not yours?  Oh, hey, Danny, you're going to take that?  Hey, Noah, you're all right, huh?  I like that.  You got balls.  Danny, you're going to take that from him?  What's this world coming to?  You got no proof.  This could be yours.  You're the one that weighs $1.20.  I weigh $1.60.  There's no way I could fit into that.  That's all you, my man.  $1.20, huh?  Yeah, no, just throw it on for Danny.  Try it if you don't like it. 
[00:23:00]  I'll do it for money.  That's all I can say.  Do it for money.  Yeah.  Isolate that.  How much money would it take for you to fulfill Danny's fantasy?  Well, we got a dollar on the table so far.  Dollar?  I don't know.  That's not enough.  How much?  How much would it take?  Let's see.  $10.  $10?  Jesus.  Wow.  God, that sounded like some back alley somewhere, didn't it?  $10?  Throw $10 down. 
[00:23:30]  Jesus.  I got $10 easily.  Are you kidding me?  Who's got the $10?  There will be no negotiating.  That's hysterical.  $10?  That's all?  $10?  But there's no guarantee I'm going to fin this.  I don't know.  Dude, this is not enough money in the world for me to throw that on.  Not to ruin it here.  Sorry.  Who's got $10?  I only have $100.  I only have $100.  Which I easily would have thrown down.  Yeah.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  A crisp $20 bill. 
[00:24:00]  20.  I have to get in this and come back after the break.  You know what?  I'll give $10 and we'll give $10 because we're that type of guys.  We'll give you, yeah, $20.  We'll give you $10 each.  That's very kind of you to give me that, too.  Yeah, we're really kind.  To put me in this really nice outfit.  But I want to see both shirts.  I want to see both shirts.  What do you mean?  He's got two options for shirts.  I don't know which one I like better.  Oh, I didn't even notice the other shirts.  Oh, yeah.  That's awesome right now.  $10 per shirt, all right?  Oh, my God.  I didn't even notice this shirt.  I don't know.  All right.  $10.  I think I might need more money. 
[00:24:30]  All right, Noah.  Thank you.  Take your $20 and we'll see you after the commercials.  All right.  All right.  All right.  For his big reveal, as they say on the reality shows.  Stay tuned.  Cost us a little too much money, I think.  What a dummy.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show and Noah's big reveal.  What a dummy.  Dude.  Oh, $10 sucky sucky.  We will love you a long time.  Dude, I would have easily thrown $100 down myself, and I know you would have matched my 
[00:25:00]  $100.  Oh, when he said he wanted money, I'm automatically thinking at least $100.  Right, right.  He goes, at least $100.  He goes, yeah, $10.  Oh, didn't it just have that right outside a glory hole feel to it when he said that?  $10.  How much would you have given, seriously?  And Eric doesn't make a lot of money here.  He does okay.  You would have thrown a minimum of $10, $20 down, right?  Dude, we would have got $10 to $20 a man, easily.  I blow that on bananas and bagels every morning. 
[00:25:30]  $10.  He's going to humiliate himself.  $10.  Where's Steve say it?  Why, I gave $100 to the phone guy just to take the clicking out.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  All right.  $10.  And the way he said it, $10?  Oh.  Just after you hear that, the next sound is zip.  I think he really wants to put that on.  And he was just making it look like it was about the money, but he slipped by saying $10. 
[00:26:00]  $10.  It's the worst of the O.P. Anthony show.  Dude, your shirt's still unbuttoned.  Yeah.  Didn't we say to please button it up for us?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Please button it.  Why are you walking around with your shirt unbuttoned?  And then he clenches it like, uh, uh.  Yeah.  You're not dying.  You're killing everyone around you.  He clenches it like a bathrobe.  I'm not going to change my look for anybody.  I like it.  It's my look. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, but open that far.  No insult, I mean, but.  You're not going to button that up?  I kind of like it like this.  Wow.  Wow.  It just seems really weird because we're all guys and.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unless you have a bag of Coke and you're going into Studio 54.  Right.  That is close by, but no, I don't.  Sorry.  Button it up.  Please button it up.  Please button that up. 
[00:27:00]  Why do you refuse to button up your shirt?  I'm not asking you to button up your shirt.  That is really.  No gold chain to break it up with or anything?  Nope.  You're going to break up the neckline or something?  It's just.  Danny?  Hey, broadcast major, talk on the mic, will you?  I am talking to the mic.  Yeah.  Maybe we can hang a little bag off that and then you can just.  I'm sorry to say they don't teach you much at school.  So, you know, when it comes to broadcast.  Yeah.  As you can see. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  Well, thank you, Noah.  Anytime.  All right.  Anytime for 10 bucks.  For a nickel or a dime.  What?  Can you get Noah?  You want to ask him?  What?  I'm not asking him.  If he's gay?  Yeah.  Can you get Noah, dude?  There's going to be no fessing up of it.  He's already said, you know, talking about girlfriends and stuff.  Can you get Noah?  Noah, Anthony has something to ask you.  Absolutely.  Go ahead.  Pardon? 
[00:28:00]  I didn't have anything to ask anybody.  Sure.  Somebody call me.  Why would I want to ask anybody?  Jamie?  Didn't Anthony say?  Yeah.  He said that he was something he wanted to ask.  Okay.  I don't believe I said I had a question for Noah.  I didn't remember asking anything.  Am I to be asking you a question?  No, I don't remember that.  Somebody said there was a question out here.  No question.  Dismissed.  Okay.  Do you have a girlfriend?  Do I have a girlfriend?  Not at the moment.  What happened to her? 
[00:28:30]  I haven't been dating for a while.  Her name is George Glass.  Of course I have a girlfriend.  George Glass.  You're trying to put me on the spot.  I'm not at all, actually.  How long have you been single?  How long have I been single?  About a year, I would say.  And you had a girlfriend before that?  Yes, I did.  What was her name?  What was her name?  Pat?  Do I have to say it on the air?  Just the first name.  Her name was Julie?  That was convincing. 
[00:29:00]  Holy mother of pearl.  Wow.  Julie.  Yes.  What nationality was she?  What nationality?  White.  Jewish.  Jewish?  Yes.  And what town did she live in?  The same town that I'm from.  I'm from Philly, originally.  Uh-huh.  So she's from Philly.  Yes.  And what's she doing now?  I believe she goes to school in California.  California.  Yes.  How old is she?  Same age as me, 21.  Cool.  She dated for a while? 
[00:29:30]  A little bit.  How long was a little bit?  A few months.  What ended the relationship?  I don't really know.  I mean, you don't know.  You don't really know?  All of a sudden, you just stop seeing each other.  You go out for a few months, and then all of a sudden, you just don't?  You took off her panties and went, where is it?  So what, um, how old you did it for?  I would say a few months.  A few months. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  What's a few?  Two?  Six.  Two.  Two to three, I would say.  Two to three.  I know my last relationship, who it was with.  I know how long.  I know what broke us up.  Did you break up with her, or did she break up with you?  Um, it was kind of mutual, I would say.  Kind of mutual.  No, you seem a little nervous, because you're doing a lot.  Yeah, don't be nervous.  We're just talking to you.  Yeah.  Her name is Judy.  No, Julie.  Okay.  Julie, right.  Yes.  And you broke up.  Yes.  But you have no idea why.  Were things going well?  Well, just kind of lost contact, like stopped calling, so. 
[00:30:30]  Really?  Yes.  So you think she might have tried to break up with you and just kind of let it.  As possible.  Kind of ooze away.  It didn't really hurt me that much.  She was kind of a really flaky person, so.  Yeah.  How long did you date her before you had sex?  Oh, God.  Or didn't you?  No, I did.  I, I don't.  Ask me how, ask me how long I dated my ex-girlfriend before we had sex.  Okay, how long?  Went down on to the first date. 
[00:31:00]  In the car.  After she was robbed at Knife Point in Washington Square Park for coke money.  Really?  Yeah.  True story.  True story.  It really is a true story.  But I remember all of them.  I remember how long we dated.  Jimmy, what are you trying to say, Jimmy?  No, no, I'm only, I'm saying.  Maybe your memory is just a little better than Noah's.  It's weird, like, all right, so Julie, you've been single for a year, you dated Julie for  a few months, not too sure how long, and you dated, like,  you dated her for a little while.  Mm-hmm.  Who was before her?  Who was before her?  Think, think, think, think.  Mm-hmm.  Switch the gender? 
[00:31:30]  Fake name, fake name.  I'm not switching the gender on you.  No, I know you're not.  He's being a smart aleck.  You're trying.  He's being a smart aleck.  Her name was Alex?  Yeah.  What do you mean Alexia?  Alexia.  Alexia.  No, what was the girl's name before her?  Before Julie.  Girl's name before her.  Yes.  I'm not remembering off the top of my head.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't date that much.  Mm-hmm.  That's why I should probably stand out.  See, if you date a lot, the point I'm making is if you date a lot, and I'm not being cruel,  I'm just really helpful.  No, I understand. 
[00:32:00]  If you date a lot, then you probably don't, like, if you ask me, what was the name of  this hooker?  I'll be like, I don't know, because there's so many, but it's like you ask girlfriends,  and I remember them, because there are only a few.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  No, I know.  So, you remember Julie, but you're very vague on the memory.  So, who was before Julie?  I didn't really have any serious relationships really before that.  No?  No.  No?  So, three months, and how long ago was this?  This was about a year ago.  A year ago.  Okay.  So, for three months, a year ago, that was pretty much your only relationship that you've 
[00:32:30]  ever had?  I wouldn't say my only relationship I ever had, but...  Who'd you lose your virginity to?  I'm going to lose my virginity to.  Yes.  Good question.  Gosh.  You're really putting me on the spot here.  Why?  Mine was Michelle.  I was 18.  She was 15.  She is now overseas.  You know, she moved to Miami after that.  We dated in high school for six months.  Mine was Christine.  They called her Buzz in California.  I was, I think, 13.  She was 19.  Oof.  And, yeah, it was actually in my bedroom while my parents were out. 
[00:33:00]  Mine was Bonnie.  Freshman year in Geneseo.  Yes, I was a late bloomer, Anthony.  And she had a horse mane.  A horse mane.  She had that.  Oh, she was the one with the little row of hair down the middle of her back?  It was an inch wide.  It went from the bottom of her back neck all the way to her tailbone.  Was it wispy like an intern mustache?  Or was it heavy?  It was some weird birth defect that I didn't notice until I turned her over.  And I was horrified, yes.  That's awful.  So, Noah, you? 
[00:33:30]  It's very, all we're saying is it's a thing that, as a guy, it is very memorable.  It's a life memory that you take to the grave with you.  It's one of those things that you just remember.  We've gone through this with everybody, by the way.  You're not alone.  You're just a new guy.  He's next.  Yeah.  So, everyone has gone through it except for you and Ricky.  So, who was the...  I can't decline to answer the question.  Why would you?  No.  We're just chatting.  I just don't like mentioning people's names in case they're listening.  Just the first name.  No, that...  All right.  Well, then just... 
[00:34:00]  How about the first name?  Yeah, fake the name and just tell us what it was about, then.  Yeah, the first name.  How old were you?  How old was I?  That's good.  How old was I?  Seventeen.  Okay, seventeen.  And where'd you meet this person?  This is high school.  You met them in high school?  High school?  Little high school sweetheart.  How old were they?  Same age.  Yeah.  Okay.  Seventeen?  Yeah.  Did you date or no?  A little bit.  Not really.  Not really.  And how about a name?  Just give us a name.  A first name only.  No last name.  First name.  Do I really have to? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Can you put somebody else in the spot for this?  Would I want to say that?  Nah.  No, it's all right if you are.  First letter.  First letter of the first name.  First letter of the first name.  A.  A?  Yeah.  Can I give you that much?  Andy.  That's good.  No, it would be.  There's plenty of.  Ashley is a good name.  Andy's a good name.  And Andy can go for a girl.  So if you're trying to imply that.  No, no.  I'm just saying like.  Yeah, Anthony.  If I want to think of a 17 year old high school girl, I'm thinking Ashley. 
[00:35:00]  Yes.  That's just the first thing that came to my mind.  Arthur.  The fine girl's name.  But okay.  So give us the setting.  How it happened.  Briefly.  You know, quickly.  Radio-like.  How did it happen?  Where was it?  Wow.  Oh, let's see.  It was at a house party in my area.  Uh-huh.  I'm in a suburb outside of Philadelphia.  And how did it come together?  How did it come together?  A lot of alcohol.  Alcohol involved.  That's always good.  Yes.  And you're at this house party. 
[00:35:30]  Yes.  You know this girl from high school.  Yes.  And you've been dating or talking to her or going out or something.  How did you both know it was time?  More talking to each other.  Talking to each other.  Yeah.  So you're hanging out at this party and now you decide you're going to do it.  Where?  Pretty much.  At a party?  Up in someone's bedroom or?  No, actually it was on a sofa.  On a sofa?  Yes.  In front of people?  It's a party.  There's people there.  It's kind of hard to remember all the details, but there could have been some. 
[00:36:00]  Well, you would remember if people were watching.  Now, if you're at a party.  I don't think it was exactly a show.  What, you star in Behind the Green Door?  How do you not remember this?  If you're at a party and you're on a couch with a girl having sex, I would assume, especially  the first time, this is your first time having sex, you would want it to be a little  more private.  True.  So you just did it on a couch at a party?  Yeah.  You'd always been curious about experiencing this?  Curious about experiencing what? 
[00:36:30]  The sexual experience.  Yeah.  Had some guilt over these feelings, maybe?  Guilt?  No.  No.  No guilt.  No guilt.  So you finished up?  Yeah.  Used protection at all?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yes.  And then what did you do with the protection?  Marching in front of the party goers and dropping in the punch bowl?  Or did you tie it off and throw it at someone?  I don't think I tried to remember all these details, so...  But your first time is some time, that's when you do remember the details. 
[00:37:00]  Everyone remembers the details.  I remember smells that are years old from that first time.  Decades, Anthony.  Decades old.  At this point.  Decades.  If there's a perfume or something that wafts by, it goes, ding, my first time.  It's just that that's what happens.  Right.  True.  And you don't remember how you picked up the condom and disposed of it at a party after  you had sex in front of party goers your first time?  Yes.  And wiped the brown off the tip of the condom? 
[00:37:30]  No.  No, no.  No, it was the special place in front of the BM.  No.  All right.  I'm not going to give you that.  No.  Damn.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  A lot of people want the NOAA update, our intern that is a bit on the feminine side.  I mean, that's fair to say.  Well, people are...  I'm not going to agree with you, but...  It doesn't mean you're gay.  I don't really know.  I guess we'll try to figure that out as your tenure here continues.  But what I do want to bring up today is I've never seen anyone wear a baseball cap gayer 
[00:38:00]  in my life.  You decided...  The way it's sitting on your head.  I've never seen anyone wear a baseball cap like you're wearing it.  And I've seen baseball caps worn all sorts of ways, Anthony.  You see the rally caps at the Met games.  You see the baseball cap on backwards.  Right.  The homies have it, you know...  A little sideways.  A little sideways with a perfect angle.  And they can pull it off.  Inside out, upside down on your head. 
[00:38:30]  I think it looks pretty normal.  I think you're looking too deep into it.  I think you're looking for innuendos that are not there.  I've never seen a baseball cap sit on someone's head like that.  That hat looks perfect if you're on the witness stand with Denzel Washington as your lawyer.  It's like a conductor's hat.  I would really like to be able to describe it, but I really can't.  I'm troubled.  I think we need a picture.  Well, I can tell you it's a BMW hat. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, no, it's nothing to do with the hat.  It's the way it's sitting on your head.  It's so far back on your head that the brim itself, the visor part, is sitting on the front of your head.  But I have a big head.  That's one thing.  Well, it's almost like the way that Vic Morrow would wear his hat in 1948.  Oh, very good.  In combat.  Yeah, or in Blackboard Jungle.  That old vibe with the little teeny hat on the large head. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  And the little open-collared shirt.  That's the other problem, that the hat's too small for your head.  You know what it looks like?  You look like an English private school student.  Really?  Yeah.  I think at least I toned it down today.  I mean, do you think?  Well, no.  You have three buttons buttoned?  Not at all.  The only reason that's not buttoned any lower is because the jacket itself isn't any lower.  No, no, I mean.  By the way, what was the last girlfriend's name?  What's that?  The last girlfriend's name?  Yeah.  Of course it was Julie.  Damn, stop. 
[00:40:00]  We all know it was Julie.  People are like, oh, what happened?  We got a cliffhanger yesterday, and you're not telling us the rest of it.  I read a lot of the feedback.  I'm sorry to hear that.  And people are saying, because I hesitated on air yesterday, that it's questionable about  my sexuality.  Right.  But I think, in my defense, I think I hesitated because I'm just not the type of person.  I don't think it was the hesitation that got to the listeners, quite frankly.  No, I think it was more your voice.  I think it was the, but it had a little bit to do with the hesitation. 
[00:40:30]  The, when we said, what's your, what was your girlfriend's name?  The first thing you said was, what's my girlfriend's, what was my girlfriend's name?  Yeah, I know.  Like, when you answer a question by repeating the question, that is a textbook, textbook signal  for somebody is not being honest.  I mean, you could read it in, you know, interrogators will tell you this.  The police will tell you this.  That's just how it goes.  And I think that the problem was that we had, we showed you the naked girl and we have audio 
[00:41:00]  of you looking at the naked girl.  Oh.  Oh, you want me to play that now?  Yes.  This raised some eyebrows, yes.  I don't remember this.  Vomiting?  Is that vomiting right here?  Of course you don't.  I don't remember this.  Of course you don't.  And then the smacking of the lips, that, which is kind of like.  Yeah, there were a lot of telltale signs of.  That you were really nervous.  Of maybe not being completely honest is what we're saying. 
[00:41:30]  I think being on the, putting the spot about something personal makes me nervous.  Danny has just handed me a note.  Oh.  Danny, who's leading the charge of interns that don't like Noah.  Is this like becoming a club or something?  I'm not in that club.  I like you.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  You can share the microphone with Noah.  Why not?  If you want air time, you've got to get right up to Noah.  I don't want to get lupus.  No, just.  Lupus is a black disease.  Just hold that microphone right in front of his face and smack his cheek with it. 
[00:42:00]  Lupus is not a girl's disease, is it?  It's a black disease.  No.  A black disease?  That's sickle cell.  Lupus is a disease of both genders.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I apologize.  This is from Danny, just so I don't get attacked, so I moved to another microphone.  Are you afraid that he's one of those Matthew Shepard guys that might want to beat you up,  but they have weird feelings?  Like, as he punches you, he's letting his hand rest on your smooth chest a little too long.  I actually got feedback like that in reference to Matthew Shepard in particular, which surprised  me.  Huh.  But, um...  No, there's no violence or anything. 
[00:42:30]  You've got a really big collar on today, too.  I mean, it's just...  Wide lapels?  Yeah.  It's just the way I like to dress.  I don't see what the big deal is.  And what kind of blazer is that today?  Is that an expensive blazer?  No, not really.  It's been out in our public.  Dude, you think about what you wear every day, which is fine, but, I mean, we all get  here at like 5 in the morning.  Let me tell you something.  See what I'm wearing?  This is the second day in a row.  I will wear this the rest of the week.  Because I don't care.  I just want to get here, do the radio show, make sure I don't have bad breath, and get 
[00:43:00]  the hell out of here.  My girlfriend puts my clothes out for me.  Yeah.  I swear to God, night before, they're out because I don't want to think about anything  when I wake up too early in the morning.  I don't want to think.  My new thing is I wear the same outfit, if you want to call it, all week long, because  I realize there's no reason to dress up.  No.  We don't have any, unless we have an interview or something stupid to do after the show,  you will see me in this same sweater all week.  Friday, I will be wearing the same thing.  It'll be a little rankier, but I don't care.  The same sweater itself or the same type of sweater? 
[00:43:30]  No, the same sweater.  Well, perhaps you ought to change the sweater.  Trust me, I'm paying attention.  I'm smelling the clothes, making sure there's nothing happening, but I'll put on some deodorant.  I'll throw some cologne on, and I'll make sure I don't have bad breath, and I'll come  in here and do the radio show.  I have to be honest.  I woke up late this morning, and I didn't take time to pick out my outfit.  Like, five minutes it took.  You don't believe me?  It's true.  No, no.  He was a little distracted by the way your hand was moving while you explained that.  Actually, I don't even disagree, because I find myself, a lot of times, I will wear 
[00:44:00]  the same socks or the same clothes for a couple of days.  I've done that.  I don't give any thought whatsoever to what I put on in the morning as I move my hand.  If you just get up like that, it's not a big deal.  You're very animated, by the way.  Yes.  You like to talk with your hands.  Yeah.  Your hand is always moving like a magician would move it as he's trying to conjure something.  It's kind of like you have a tough time keeping your hand up when you talk. 
[00:44:30]  I think I'm trying to make implications here.  I don't know.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  It's just implications.  We're just pointing out things that are actually happening.  Anthony and I are very observant.  That's why we're as popular as we are.  We have to be.  We have to be.  We observe human nature, and we comment on it.  That's why we get paid the big bucks there, Noah.  So, we got Danny in the studio.  Danny, what is the problem today?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I noticed something when I came in today that kind of disturbed me a little bit.  I noticed Noah's chest stubble, and that kind of... 
[00:45:00]  Chest stubble.  Stubble, yeah.  Chest stubble.  Noah, do you shave your chest?  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Hold on, everyone.  Just remain calm and grab the seat.  Strap in whatever you have to do to get over that.  All right.  I don't like having a hairy chest.  I got a side with Noah on that one.  Shut up, Jimmy.  No, no, no, no, no.  But you can't even grow hair. 
[00:45:30]  No, I don't have chest hair, but I know guys like Florentine.  I know other guys that are very straight that do shave their chest hair, so I can't knock  them for that.  I've been known to trim up.  Thank you.  I've been known to trim up, but I let it grow in.  I don't judge you, dude.  Like, whatever you want to hold in your mouth for hours on end is your business.  That's between...  No, no, no, no, no.  Dude, whatever it is.  Speaking of hair, Jimmy has a very strange thing that's going on with his arm.  What?  What?  There's nothing strange about it.  Look out.  No hair is there.  Except little fine wisps of hair. 
[00:46:00]  I don't shave that at all.  It's totally natural.  Actually, feel how wispy that arm hair is.  That's very strange.  There's no hair.  That's good.  Ah!  Oh, God damn.  That is...  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I love that gag.  That will never get old. 
[00:46:30]  You can have flying cars and Mylar suits, and I'd still be laughing at that.  All right.  It's the stupidest thing.  Found out a little bit more that you shave your...  How often do you have to shave your chest hair?  It's not something I do regularly.  I mean...  No?  No.  You'll let it grow in a little bit?  Yeah, I mean...  So you're disturbed that it's a little stubbly today, your chest hair?  No, not really.  Electric or regular razor?  Just a regular razor.  Yeah.  A little shaving cream?  Do you shave your butt crack, too, so nobody gets chafed? 
[00:47:00]  No, I don't.  Wow.  Wow.  That's a huge accusation.  Danny's...  Wow.  I don't like the fact that Danny's implying that you shave your chest hair because it  gets annoying pulling rubber cement out of it in the shower.  Stay here.  Here's Steve.  What a mess of people.  Steve.  What a mess of people.  Oh, boy, if that isn't a perfect...  Oh, big bear helping the little guy with his microphone.  Helping the small cub.  I was going to say, I do believe they call him a cub.  A cub.  Christ. 
[00:47:30]  We couldn't hear his fabulous commentary in the other room, so I simply assisted him.  Oh, we heard it.  Yeah.  It's martini, Steve.  Yeah, I'm bad.  Well, I have to say that being a Jewish guy, usually you get a pretty hairy chest, and  I just don't like having that.  You don't like that, so...  No.  Fair enough, fair enough.  I think that's a very good explanation today.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Nothing to do with being a fairy or a fruity or...  Could you pull the hat down, though? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, but I have a big head.  That's the reason.  Did you wear that to try to be a little more manly today, and you figured, all right,  I'll wear a hat?  No, I wear this all the time.  You can ask anybody.  Who are you going to ask?  My roommates.  Ah.  Ah, roommates.  Well, let's get into that a little bit, sir.  Noah's roommates.  Noah's roommates.  Okay, so you have roommates.  Is this a house?  No, this is a dorm.  A dorm, okay.  So you're in the dorm over NYU, I guess.  Yes, I am.  And how many roommates in the dorm?  I have three other roommates.  Three other roommates? 
[00:48:30]  It's sweet.  Yes.  A sweet scene is what that is.  Okay, so three roommates, and what are they like?  What are they like?  One of them is going into the business world, like financial business student.  Yeah.  Other one is a political guy.  He's joining the Navy.  I know that.  In the Navy.  In the Navy.  You can sell the seven seas.  In the Navy.  You can drop down to your knees.  You have venereal disease? 
[00:49:00]  Well, drop down knees, venereal disease.  Same thing.  You can do whatever you want, as long as you only need nine toes to do it.  My other roommate is one of those liberal protester type guys, really super right, left wing.  Douchebag, basically.  Yeah, ass white.  He's a douche.  Well, you know, he does all kinds of protest stuff.  I remember in 2001, he got on MTV and did this big siege of TRL.  Oh, wow.  Tough guy.  What a jizzbag.  War protests and stuff like that.  Yeah, war protests guy. 
[00:49:30]  Why don't you just say that his parents probably have money, right?  Yes, they do.  Yeah, of course they do.  He's a guilt-ridden, upper-middle-class kid who can't deal with his own superiority complex,  so he decides that he's going to go out there and make a difference,  but he really just wants attention to shame mommy and daddy.  There you go.  So, your roommate, when you say what your roommate do, say he's a bucket of jizzum.  That's what he is.  There you go.  So, the first time you had sex, you were on a couch at a party in front of party goers.  I'm not back to this.  That's what we heard yesterday.  For people that didn't hear yesterday's show,  apparently Noah had his first sexual experience with a girl at a house party on the couch 
[00:50:00]  where, you know, there's party goers around.  It's a little odd that you would choose that time and place as your first time.  You know, a lot of people a little inhibited their first time.  Anthony, I got a question for Noah.  Uh-huh.  Ricky Martin fan?  No, absolutely not.  Oh.  Who do you like listening to?  Who do I like listening to?  I like listening to Led Zeppelin, actually.  Uh-huh.  And most people don't believe that for my age because I'm young and people are like, 
[00:50:30]  how can you be a big fan of this?  Well, it's not a crowd.  They're not believing it because of your age.  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  What else?  What else?  Zeppelin?  What else?  Zeppelin?  Rolling Stones?  Do you like watching Robert Plant in those old, like, the song remains the same?  In that, is that his?  That's the name of that Led Zeppelin thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeans he had on, like Bruce Dickerson, Iron Maiden poster.  Certain ones just stand out.  I met him about a year and a half ago because I worked for his record company as an intern.  Oh, okay.  And he still wears the same jeans, but he's not exactly the same guy.  Yeah, certain things.  Yeah.  So you like the Stones, Zeppelin? 
[00:51:00]  Yep.  Yep.  Classic rock.  Anything current?  Anything current that you're into?  Current, I like, I don't know, like Maroon 5.  Yeah.  In terms of current news stuff.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  If you were to be gay, what celebrity would you have sex with?  If I were to be?  Yeah.  If you had to pick a celebrity, for me, it's Ozzy Osbourne.  Wow, Jimmy.  Yeah.  All right.  I talked to that years ago.  That's kind of nasty, though.  Exactly.  But it's not about the sex.  It's about thanking him.  Why would it be nasty to have sex with Ozzy?  Because he's kind of an old guy. 
[00:51:30]  So there are guys that would be better than Ozzy?  I mean, I would think so.  We had paid dirt.  Because he's an older guy.  That's a good point.  That's fair.  And he's not in good shape.  He's not in good shape.  It's not that he's a guy.  It's just that he's an older guy.  Right.  So if you weren't, let's just say, let's go out on a limb here.  Say, if you weren't attracted to a girl.  Why are we going out on a limb?  I'm not just going out on a limb.  I'm saying, well, let's go out on a limb.  If you weren't.  Jimmy said he'd have sex with Ozzy if he was gay.  And you said that's nasty because Ozzy's older.  Old and in bad shape.  And he's young. 
[00:52:00]  Right.  So who would you have sex with if you were gay?  Yeah.  What celebrity?  If I was.  If you had to pick.  Yeah.  God, that's a hard one.  I don't know.  I know there's a lot of choices.  But I mean, if you had to narrow it down for a first experience.  I'd say Jude Law is a good looking guy.  Jude Law.  Yeah.  All right.  Get a little Jude Law.  Who's Jude Law?  English actor.  Okay.  What's he been in?  He was in AI and.  I've been to watch a lot of his movies.  He was in AI.  He was just in that movie. 
[00:52:30]  AI, anal insertion.  Well, that's the porn version of the Kubrick film.  Sure.  Wasn't he just in Alfie?  Yeah.  He was the lead in Alfie.  Sure.  So you'd have sex with Jude Law.  Jude Law.  Jude Law was hosting the Saturday Night Live.  I didn't say I would.  We know Jimmy.  He's just saying.  I said if that.  All right.  So what were you.  You got my choices.  Right.  What is it that made you pick him?  What is it that made me pick him?  Yeah.  Fair question.  I told you why I picked Ozzy.  I guess out of all the choices. 
[00:53:00]  He's decent looking.  So there's a lot of choices out there.  Is he in good shape?  I assume so.  He's a pretty popular actor.  A lot of girls like him.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Jude Law.  What female celebrity do you find attractive?  Female celebrity?  I would say Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's kind of like a hacky answer.  You know what I mean?  It's like saying do you watch football and you don't watch football.  You can just go, yeah, like Dallas. 
[00:53:30]  Right, right.  You can pull out.  America's team kind of thing.  I got you.  I don't see anything wrong with that answer.  I don't see anything wrong with that answer.  Nothing at all.  There's nothing wrong with the answer.  The answer's fine.  Nothing at all.  All right, Noel.  For me, the female celebrity I'd like to bang the most is Madeline Stowe.  That's always the one that I thought was the sexiest.  Yeah.  I've always thought she was the hottest.  Okay.  So Jude Law, if you had to pick a second choice, who would be second?  Yeah.  Jude is busy.  Oh, God.  Yes.  Doing another bad film.  Jude is busy banging broad.  But, so, yeah, you got to pick someone else. 
[00:54:00]  I don't, I've never given this any thought, so I don't.  All right, well, just give it a second.  Well, you pulled Jude Law, a thin air.  Yeah.  Well, there are images in your head right now, I'm sure.  Who comes to mind, honestly?  Yeah.  Who's going through the Rolodex right now in your head?  Who comes to mind?  Because if you had to do it, but there had to be kissing involved, too.  It wouldn't just be, like, sex.  It would have to be, like, a gentle, nice experience.  Right, right.  That's what I'm saying.  Because you're not gay if you don't kiss.  Right.  So you'd have to kiss the guy, too.  Right.  Yes.  Right.  And hold his chin with your thumb and pointer finger. 
[00:54:30]  Very tenderly.  Gently.  And then do this.  Um, I guess, all right, I guess I would go with Matt Damon, I would say.  Matt Damon.  Second choice.  Matt Damon.  All right, Matt Damon.  But you asked.  Understandable.  It's because we asked.  Well, let's ask Danny.  Danny, if you were gay, who would you have sex with?  I want to hear this.  There is no correct answer to this question. 
[00:55:00]  Wow.  The recruit knows.  I don't think it's the answer.  No, do you understand that everyone in the other room is yelling and screaming and trying  to help you out going, do not answer that question.  They're all, like, screaming.  I can see it through the glass going, no.  See, Noah, you never answer that question.  That's the thing that every guy seems to know.  When you're asked that, you just never answer it.  I don't know about that.  There is no correct answer.  Because he said, well, he picked Jude Law first, but then when the kissing thing came, 
[00:55:30]  you said Matt Damon.  Obviously, he's a better actor.  I think he's a better actor.  Yeah, he's good actor.  He's probably better looking.  I mean, you may think Jude Law's better looking, but I think Matt Damon's better looking.  All right.  Well, Noah, thank you very much.  Of course.  Anytime.  Again, might I say, fabulous appearance.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good job.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sam, still to come.  We're still doing Noah 2, but this time we're getting Bob Kelly involved.  Everybody's favorite comedian, Bob Kelly, stops by an expert on all things gay to declare 
[00:56:00]  the sexuality of intern Noah 2.  When we come back.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, today's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's not a live show.  You're stuck with E-Rock and primetime Sam Roberts.  ONA took the day off today.  We are live.  Yes, we are here.  And we're bringing you something that people have requested for such a long time, but we  just never got around to.  It's the saga of intern Noah number 2.  Yes, one of the most annoying interns in show history. 
[00:56:30]  Noah 2.  It's been years since we've rebroadcast any of this.  An intern from 2005.  His sexuality was questionable, and Bob Kelly and his friend Gavin were in studio to question  just that.  Well, not as much question as to blatantly point out as Bob sat down, that guy is gay.  Well, Bob would know.  He would.  He likes you.  Apparently he does.  He assaults you a lot.  Well, that has nothing to do.  He sexts you.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  He posts love notes on his Twitter. 
[00:57:00]  Well, again, no idea what you're talking about.  But that has nothing to do with Noah 2, which is what we're here to talk about, what we're  here to dissect, and what we're here to play back for you.  Intern Noah 2 meets Bob Kelly and Gavin on the worst of ONA.  This is the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  What the fuck is going on?  This is unfunny.  Drek is the worst.  The fuck is the worst of O.P. going on?  On Sirius XM.  I had a problem last year when I was fatter, because I lost 30 pounds. 
[00:57:30]  I used to be, when I was heavier, I literally had a problem, because I don't think blood  was getting down to my conch.  Really?  And it would actually pop in.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  I'd walk it on the street, and I'd feel it pop in, and I'd have to rub it to pop it  back out.  Are you kidding?  Because blood wasn't getting down to my, my, my, my, my stroke, my, my, my dick.  So it would, it would, it would pop in?  It would pop, it would, I could feel it.  You'd feel like a like, you could, you could, if there was a sound, that would be the sound, 
[00:58:00]  Anthony.  And it would just kind of pop in, and what would you, I'd have to rub it and pop it  back out.  Ugh.  I, and I, I'm like a genie, making a wish.  I wish I had a cock like a man.  I think I'm sitting, the older you get, I think the, hey, look who's here for the  conch conversation.  Oh, I popped right in.  You could straighten that right out for him, couldn't you, son?  Jesus Christ.  Wait, get on, get on mic there, Noah.  This is Noah.  Oh, my God.  Noah, how you doing?  He's our new intern.  I'm doing good.  And he likes to dress up for, I don't know, for his position here on the Opie and Anthony 
[00:58:30]  program.  Yeah, allegedly, I do.  Show him the back of your shirt.  All right.  Show him what it says on the back.  Oh, wow, the back of your shirt.  Show him the back of your ass, son.  That's nice.  What does that say?  I don't know.  It's just the way he stands with the jacket there.  Oh, dude, you are.  Like he's modeling for something.  He's a good kid.  We really don't know what he is.  We're trying to figure it out, quite frankly.  He's gay.  I'll tell you right now.  I don't know about that.  You're gay.  You don't know you're gay yet?  Oh, you haven't come to terms with it yet?  But you're definitely, you're gay.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  I'm looking at you.  Look it right at me. 
[00:59:00]  I'm looking right at you.  Look at me.  Yeah.  You're gay.  Well, I appreciate the comment, but I'm not going to say anything.  I know you're not going to say anything.  It's okay to be gay.  He's not going to say anything.  He had a girlfriend.  He had a girlfriend.  He likes Zeppelin, and he likes the Rolling Stones.  Yeah.  Norton likes Ozzy and had a girlfriend, and then he does like trainees, too, every once  in a while.  That's only being diplomatic.  I feel if I'm going to have a prostitute, you've got to spread the wealth a little bit.  I don't need trainees protesting.  I'm not a bigot.  You know, you all are saying I'm gay, but you know.  We're not saying you're gay. 
[00:59:30]  No one here.  Hold on.  Let's go around the room.  I have not said you were gay.  I absolutely have not said you were gay.  Jimmy, despite my inner thoughts, I've said nothing of the kind.  Maybe implications.  I mean, we say things behind your back when you're not listening, but we haven't said  anything on the air.  I really don't know what you are.  If you have any offers of any girls, I didn't say I would decline that either, so, you know.  Oh.  Oh.  You know what?  I'm going to suck your cock right now to prove you're gay.  How's that sound?  I'm going to pass an offer, but I'm like, you know.  It took you two seconds to figure that out, though, didn't it?  We could bring back the old gag. 
[01:00:00]  We had a gay guy who really liked NSYNC so much that we had him kind of, you know, eat  out a girl for the tickets.  For the tickets, yeah.  He was out of his mind, miserable.  He had to do it for the length of an NSYNC song.  That's one of the best bits we've ever done.  And he never saw a girl below the belt naked.  So he pulled her panties down and he started crying.  He was crying going, what is that?  Like, he goes, stuff is hanging out.  He was petrified. 
[01:00:30]  Petrified.  He had to go down on a nice stink wrinkle.  Poor guy.  Yeah, it was awful for him.  Well, I mean, I just have to say, I'm a guy who likes to dress nice.  I mean, I don't think that means that, you know, necessarily that is my sexuality.  I'm thinking people are making more than just the dressing.  It's the hand on the hip, the Roman god lean you have on one ass cheek, the little fingers  on the table.  Yeah, there's little things, maybe. 
[01:01:00]  Some of the way you speak a little bit.  Well, I mean, okay, so I'm not a manly man, necessarily.  All right.  Well, what kind of man, what other man is there?  There's a feminine man.  No, I didn't say a feminine man.  We asked if you would have sex with a guy if you had to, and he picked, like, what guy?  I picked Ozzy, and he picked Jude Law.  Jude Law.  That's such an obscure, who knows Jude Law?  You gave thought to her.  If any guy did, if you were being tortured and had to come up with an answer, like, any  guy would pull, like, a very popular guy's name out of his head. 
[01:01:30]  You don't go for the Jude Law thing.  I think he's a pretty popular guy.  No, he's not.  You say Brad Pitt.  Every guy goes, yeah, I'd blow Brad.  Brad's hot.  No, every guy doesn't say that, Bob.  Yeah, well.  Thank you for yourself, Bob.  Sorry.  Jesus.  He's, like, in four movies right now.  He's been on the cover of People magazine.  I mean, he's a pretty popular guy.  He was voted sexiest man alive.  Exactly.  Uh-huh.  The fact that you know this, the fact that you read People.  No, he told me.  He told me.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry.  Jim knew this. 
[01:02:00]  And then we asked him again.  He goes, who else would you...  If you had to kiss and stuff.  Why is it if kissing had to be involved?  If kissing was involved.  And then he changed his answer, and...  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  I said Matt Damon, but...  Bob, who would it be for you if you had to kiss him?  If I had to kiss a guy, it had to be kissing.  Intimately kissing.  Shin-holding.  Yeah, we all had answers yesterday.  I'd probably have to say...  An actor?  Brad Pitt.  So you would kiss and have sex with Brad Pitt?  I don't know if I'd have sex with...  I'd kiss Brad Pitt.  I might have sex with George Clooney. 
[01:02:30]  Because he'd be a little softer.  I think Brad would be like, you like that?  You like that?  And he'd go into his California role and...  I mean, when I was...  Pulling the back of my ears and...  Come on!  When I was given the choice, I think the choice of somebody who's palatable is better than  like Ozzy Osbourne for a chance.  Palatable?  Good word.  Yeah, good word, homo.  I think it's a better choice than somebody who's Ozzy Osbourne.  No, it's not.  You should never say it's a better choice.  It should never make a difference. 
[01:03:00]  Because you're making the real decision like he's got a great body.  I'm actually...  I'm willing to do it out of respect for the music.  Like, I wouldn't be gay because I'd be humming Iron Man the whole time.  There's nothing gay about him.  But that's nasty.  They call him Iron Man.  Ozzy's nasty.  I mean, have you seen him without a shirt on the show?  Yes.  That's the fact that you're gay.  Right.  It's not about nasty.  It's not about if he's disgusting.  You're sucking a dick.  Who cares what he looks like?  It's a cock going in your mouth.  There's no pretty cock.  The fact that you'd rather have a great upper torso while you're sucking cock. 
[01:03:30]  That's what makes you gay?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Bob just made a weird statement.  You're sucking cock?  It doesn't matter what he looks like.  Well, that proves that you're straight is what he's saying.  Well, if you have to look up and see pretty eyes and nice lips and a nice chin line, you  know, then that means you're gay.  If I had to suck a cock, I don't care if it was Norton's cock.  It's a cock.  All right, put it in my mouth.  Get it over with.  Yeah, but if we're talking about sucking, I mean, people that old probably can't even get 
[01:04:00]  it up.  Can you say sucking again one more time?  Sucking.  There you go.  So you're saying that you'd prefer, you're right, Ozzy might not be able to get it up  through his medication.  So me, I'd have a little limp one in my mouth, but you would prefer one that is filled with  blood and engorged and almost angry.  Yeah, nice.  Because there's nothing worse than somebody holding your head and a soft one being shoved  in.  You want one that's going to make you go.  And a little tear come down like you're watching a midget get married.  You want a nice nine and a half cut.  I think the old thing's repulsive. 
[01:04:30]  I don't care what Ozzy did.  I mean, I don't care if he was, you know, greatest rock star legend in history.  Can I ask you a question?  Do you like cut or uncut?  Would you prefer clipped or unclipped?  I don't have an answer for that.  Yes, you do.  Yeah, you do.  I totally don't have an answer.  If you had to go down on a man, what would you rather prefer, cut or uncut?  Do you have an answer for that?  Yes.  I'm asking you.  I do.  Yes.  Okay.  What would your answer be?  But he asked you first.  I know.  Okay.  What's your answer?  I would ask cut or uncut.  It's no big deal. 
[01:05:00]  What's your answer?  Well, I mean, I don't think the European thing is very...  The European thing?  Hmm.  Cut or...  That's an interesting way of saying it.  Cut or uncut?  If you had to blow me or this big hump over here, Gavin, because he has a...  Oh, his mule is...  We're in my gym, and this son of a bitch...  I have a sauna for two people, and this guy's five people.  He's six...  Gavin from England, six, five, like 300 pounds, just a massive man. 
[01:05:30]  We go in the sauna.  I'm in my shorts and my t-shirt, like American men do when you're in a sauna with another man.  Yeah.  He walks in fully nude, those English weirdos.  And his huge snuffleupagus, tricolored friggin' mule.  It had like three different colors, the base, and then the middle, and then the end of the little snout.  Yeah, but can I ask, why were you looking...  Like an English guy?  How do you know so much she tailed?  English guards hat.  How do I...  Because I'm a man.  But how do you know so much she tailed? 
[01:06:00]  Because a man walks in with a big mule, uncut.  I'm going to look at it to tell my other friends.  That's why.  Plus, when you're Gavin's height, you can't help it.  It's dangling in your face.  I'm 5'8".  Look at him.  To help a glance, I'm going to look up and not look at it.  He sat on the stoop above me.  It was resting on my shoulder.  And it said, Bert.  Bert.  So cut or uncut?  What were you saying?  Well, I would say cut.  I mean...  Cut.  Of course.  Yes.  Because you just...  To be honest with you, you'd probably say that that looks a lot better than the... 
[01:06:30]  Like, as you say, the European look.  It's more appealing to the eye, right?  Well, I guess so.  Do you know if Queer Eye for the Straight Guy came in to do something on you?  They just come in and go, finished.  That's the quickest show ever.  You're wearing tight jeans, a tight shirt, a tight hat.  You're wearing glasses in the day.  Gucci.  Gucci sunglasses.  Everything is...  And you have to show the Gucci belt.  Everything is an ad for, like, look at me.  I shop great.  Bloomingdale's.  I mean, either you're gay or you have shitty jokes like Rich Voss. 
[01:07:00]  That's the only other tight-clothed asshole I know.  Well, we really don't know for sure.  So we're trying to figure it out there, Bob.  Thank you for helping us out.  I'm up in the air.  We're really up in the air on this one.  To be honest with you.  I'm not saying he's not, but I'm not convinced either because there are guys that are kind of like...  You know, like you go, oh, he's gay.  And all of a sudden, like, no, he's really...  Like, there are certain people that may work for XM that I assumed were gay.  And all of a sudden, they're married.  I'm like, oh, okay, I guess he's not gay.  But I'm putting an offer on the table. 
[01:07:30]  I want to take you to...  I want to go with him to a...  Dude, I'll go with you to a gay club.  I got to help you out, though, just in case you're not.  Take your hands off your hips when you're talking.  Yeah, exactly.  That whole hands-on hip.  It's just a nervous thing.  Now, listen to me.  Stuttering is a nervous thing.  Hands on the hips and ass-tilted out is not a nervous thing.  Yeah, unless you're a superhero or you're sucking cock, you should never do that.  That's good.  Dun-da-da-da!  Able to kneel in small rest areas.  He has an S on his thing for suck.  I like the way he laughs, too. 
[01:08:00]  He covers his nose like a British woman.  There is just all kinds of things going on there.  And the girlfriend situation, you haven't had one in three months, are you saying?  Is that what it was?  No, it was more than that.  How long ago did you have a girlfriend?  How long ago?  It was about a year ago.  On the mic.  A year.  You haven't had a girlfriend in a year?  In a year.  In a year, yeah. 
[01:08:30]  So you haven't had any sexual contact in a year?  That's not true.  What was his name?  Okay, you've had some sexual contact.  Yes.  With?  With girls I met at bars.  One-night stands?  One-night stands.  Nice.  What was the last one you met at a bar?  Not her name, but what happened?  What bar?  What bar?  The bar was Central Bar.  Okay.  And it's on the east side.  And it was around.  There will always be a question.  The question we ask, he will always repeat it. 
[01:09:00]  That's right.  What bar?  What bar?  What bar?  And it was around the end of the winter semester.  So it was at the end of the winter.  All right.  What'd she look like?  What'd she look like?  She had blonde hair.  She was a little taller than me.  Green eyes.  Good figure.  Good figure?  Describing yourself in drag.  Stop.  I got blonde hair.  A little taller than you.  What was she?  5'3".  So she had a good figure, and you met her apparently in 1951.  Yeah, seriously.  Either you're gay or you have a time machine. 
[01:09:30]  So you met her, and how did you hook up in the bar?  Just got pretty drunk, and that was...  Got pretty drunk, and then what?  You went over and started talking to her?  Yeah.  Were you alone or with friends?  I was with friends, but I kind of broke off.  With friends you broke off?  Did you have a car with you?  No.  How'd you get around?  Well, we're in New York City.  Just walk around.  New York City?  So you just walk around.  Did you take her back to your place?  No, I went back to her place.  Went back to her place.  Where was it?  Her place was around Penn Station.  Penn Station.  So she was a little taller with blonde hair. 
[01:10:00]  Your hands are on your hips again.  Take it off.  Yes.  All right.  She maybe looked like...  Who'd she remind you of?  Like maybe Vince Neil.  I mean, who did she kind of be...  Beside your uncle.  A little taller with blonde hair.  What was her name?  First name.  First name.  I never got a name.  Wait, wait.  Not even a first name?  Never got a name.  Never got a name.  Never got a name.  That doesn't happen.  I've banged over a hot...  Two, three...  A thousand chicks I've banged.  Had touched my ding-ding.  I know all their names.  I know what they look like.  I'll describe what their vaginas, fat labias, big clits. 
[01:10:30]  You son of a bitch.  Whoa, which girl said fat labias and big clits?  I told you.  I don't get names.  And you don't even know her first name.  No, I don't get names and I'll leave in the middle of the night.  Girls don't do that.  Because he's a man's man, Anthony.  He doesn't need the name and he'll leave in the middle of the night.  There you go.  Boy, you sure got Jude Law's name, didn't you?  You pulled that out of the thin air.  So even talking to her in the bar, you didn't get her name?  Nope.  And you were able to ask her, what did you say?  Let's go?  I probably got her name.  I probably forgot it after the morning.  Hey, I forgot her name. 
[01:11:00]  Fucking slut.  Oh!  I don't need...  Hey, you know what her name is?  Hey, you suck this here.  Oh!  You are like the manliest man ever.  Hey, honey, I'd like to hang out, but I threw my goo already.  I gotta go.  What's your name?  I don't care, bitch.  Hickory dickory duck, I wish you had a cock. 
[01:11:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Jack be nimble, Jack be quick.  You gotta pushy.  I like dick.  Oh!  Little Jack Horner, I fucked him.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  You are a man's man. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, sure.  Gotta tell you.  His hands are back on his hips.  Take your hands off the hips.  Playing Simon Says.  I'm gonna let you guys leave what you want.  No, we don't really leave.  I don't know.  All we can go on is what you're telling us, and the story seems a bit far-fetched.  You meet this blonde, blue-eyed, like the fantasy girl of any guy.  You take her back to her place.  You don't even know her name. 
[01:12:30]  You bang her and leave.  I didn't say she was that good-looking.  I didn't say she was a fantasy girl.  Nice figure, blonde hair, blue eyes.  Yeah.  And she lived around Penn Station, you said.  Yeah.  Right.  What floor did she live on?  It was the fifth floor.  So you remember that, but not her name?  You remember her floor, but not her name.  Fifth floor.  Who lives at Penn Station?  Nobody.  It's all Puerto Rican 99-cent stores, you jackass.  The 30th Street.  And Asian massage parlors.  What blonde, blue-eyed girls are living there?  Yeah, exactly.  He said 30th Street.  No, no, no.  The 30th Street is actually a really nice apartment. 
[01:13:00]  Fifth floor, 30th Street.  Yes.  Don't remember her name.  I don't ask names.  Between what and what?  Between what?  It was between 8th and 9th.  8th and 9th?  8th and 9th.  Really?  Yes.  I think that's a little easier if you're saying between 8th and 9th.  You said on the east side.  Yeah, you did say on the east side.  I didn't say on the east side.  No, I totally did not.  You were so sad on the east side.  You said the bar was on the east side.  The bar was on the east side.  And then the bar was by Penn Station.  I thought you got him.  You're not going to get me to slip up.  Slip up. 
[01:13:30]  He just said you're not going to get me to slip up.  Right.  That's right.  Ah, you frigging son of a bitch.  So you then slept with this girl.  That's right.  Had sex with her.  Yeah.  And then left.  Yeah.  In the middle of the night.  You didn't hang out?  Nope.  Now, why didn't you hang out?  Because I didn't feel comfortable.  You didn't feel comfortable?  I kind of sobered up.  No, I kind of sobered up and said, where the hell am I?  And decided to take a cab and go back to my place.  You know what?  I do like those jeans.  Uh-oh.  You're a girl.  Those jeans are hot, dude. 
[01:14:00]  Thank you.  Now, you're gay.  A real man would say, what are you, a fag?  He said, thank you.  I appreciate that.  I'm a nice guy.  Well, Bob is convinced.  The rest of us, we're really not sure.  We're not sure.  Absolutely.  I'm not going to say definitely is.  I think, you know, we'll keep probing, if I may use the term.  And quite frankly, we don't really care if you are.  No.  We're just trying to figure it out.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with it.  There you go.  Absolutely not.  No.  If you're gay, so what?  We don't care.  If you're not, you're not.  Big deal.  I don't like either way, any more or less.  We just like, you know, knowing who we're working with. 
[01:14:30]  Well, I appreciate it.  But I would say, you can ask my roommates, and you can talk to the people that I know.  Yeah, we do have phone numbers of your roommates.  Maybe you can find out a little bit more about me.  Maybe we'll do that next time he comes in.  Oh, isn't that?  Oh, that's right.  What's the name of that book?  Noah Has a Roommate, right?  Yeah.  Heather has two mommies.  Yeah.  All right.  Noah, bye.  Noah, thank you.  Thank you.  Good talking to you.  Bye, baby bitch.  There you go.  It's just bye.  Bye. 
[01:15:00]  Noah, bye.  Bye.  Wow.  Wow.  We love the kid.  He gives us great radio, man.  You know something?  Listen, he comes off as very feminine.  Right.  He is so gay.  We don't know.  There is no one gayer.  I walked in.  That's your opinion, Bob.  No, listen to me.  I walked in.  I've been listening.  You've been talking about him.  I knew it was him the second I walked in.  I just started laughing as he walked by. 
[01:15:30]  Well, look at the rest of us.  We barely shower.  Because you're men.  There should be dirty balls and dirty ass in here.  And bad breath.  And one man that enjoys that.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am E-Rock, and he's primetime Sam Roberts.  No O&A today, so you have to deal with us here.  But what we have for you is some of the best worst of that you'll ever hear.  It's the best clips.  We haven't aired these clips in many, many years.  And now, we continue the saga of intern Noah 2 as we review his very expensive outfit and very bad pop song, Julia. 
[01:16:00]  This is an old school listener favorite.  Hasn't seen the light of day since 2005.  We bring it to you.  Enjoy Noah 2, Julia, on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The nightmare is doomed.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  You better run out of the studio.  Oh, my goodness.  Did you see him today?  I wouldn't acknowledge him because he forgot my apple. 
[01:16:30]  He forgot your apple.  Yeah.  You want to talk to him about it?  Maybe he should spend more time concentrating on your order than concentrating on the outfit he's going to wear today.  We've got to play Apple Phone.  Ha ha, ring, ring, ring, ring, Apple Phone.  Is he going out to get the apple?  Of course she is.  One of the things that are going around is that he's doing an act.  You know?  No.  I'll tell you why.  Which would really suck because we'd just have to throw him off the show. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  Hand on the hips and stuff like that.  Certain things might be like the get-ups.  I think the get-ups, like he's trying a little too hard.  Oh, believe me.  That's no act.  The hands on the hips and the way he takes his jacket off to show you his back.  Can't even explain what he's wearing.  He's got like Bono-type sunglasses on.  He's got like a, like a, what kind of hat is that?  It's a fedora.  Like a fedora.  It's sort of a fedora.  He's got like a white, it looks almost like a white velvet jacket.  Yeah, it's white.  He's got like Gucci loafers on. 
[01:17:30]  He's got a scarf.  He's got a scarf that's making him look like Charles Nelson Reilly.  Amber sunglasses.  Actually, Noah's dressed like the keep on trucking thing with that stupid hat and jacket.  He should be swinging like someone watching from him.  I'm waiting for him to come in with an ascot.  He's a second away from an ascot.  He's wearing the scarf.  He's got a scarf.  He's wearing the white velveteen blazer.  It's ridiculous.  He's an intern for a bunch of dudes, man. 
[01:18:00]  You walk in here and instantly you look at him and go, what the hell is that?  Like, what is that person thinking?  He looks like he's backstage at a play waiting to go on.  Like, that's not something people wear.  It's a costume that someone would wear in the wings waiting to walk out on stage and go,  I'm here, darling.  I'm home, darling.  Been in Europe for a while with the dopey hat.  Take it off.  Do that lunging walk to the hat rack.  Give me a kiss. 
[01:18:30]  All he needs is the cigarette with the cigarette holder.  Cigarette holder.  Bingo.  Look.  Noah.  Look.  I think the kid looks sharp.  He looks sharp.  Noah is, this is.  Noah, do you mind if we take your hat off so we can put headphones on yet?  Jesus.  That is some hat.  That is a good hat.  Thank you.  So what's going on with you, Noah?  Are you trying to get attention because you got it?  Not at all.  You don't dress like this.  No one dresses like this.  This is what everybody thinks is that I'm trying to get attention, but I really swear  that this is the way I dress every day to school.  Every day you go to school like that. 
[01:19:00]  Every day.  And people don't make fun of you.  You totally don't believe me, but I really do.  Do they point?  Dude, you know you're inside now.  Why do you need the scarf?  Oh, boy.  All the interns are making their way in.  Oh, boy.  The interns that don't really get much attention whatsoever, Anthony.  Danny's wound up in his old Navy sweatshirt that I wear every day, pretty much.  Sorry.  Nike sneakers will have to do that.  Hey, if you want attention, maybe you two should steal a hat off of Jack Klugman's body.  That is what they call a Rex Harrison hat. 
[01:19:30]  Rex Harrison reference.  The Rex Harrison hat.  Jesus.  It totally doesn't believe me that I wear a dress like this to school.  Dude, you're getting more and more flamier.  But now you're inside, so why are you going to continue wearing the scarf and the sunglasses?  Well, I just came from outside, so I'll take it.  No, no, no.  You walked around from five to six with the scarf on.  That is true.  When I walked in, you had the scarf on.  You're walking around.  You had the scarf on.  It's a plaid.  Are you going to fight the Red Baron?  It's some kind of plaid, like a kilt scarf. 
[01:20:00]  What the?  Little brown, black and white, and red stripes on it.  It's the Burberry scarf.  It's a what?  What's a Burberry?  Burberry.  I know it.  It's the brand name.  And now the black shirt underneath.  Is that anything we should know about?  No.  It's a plain black shirt.  It's just a plain black shirt.  It's a plain black shirt.  Yeah.  And the jeans.  That sport coat is corduroy.  It's corduroy?  He's right.  Big surprise.  He's right.  That's corduroy?  Yes.  It's an H&M jacket.  Left a couple of O's out of this.  There's seven jeans.  Oh.  Isn't seven jeans what girls wear? 
[01:20:30]  Seven jeans are like all the rage these days with women.  With the chicks?  Well, I hate to tell you.  How much of those jeans?  They're well over $100 a pair now or something like that.  About $140.  Yeah.  $140 for a pair of jeans.  $140 jeans.  This is a girls thing that's going on.  Girls all are saving up their money, teenagers and the like, to get a pair of seven jeans.  Let me taste it.  I don't know one guy that wears seven jeans.  And then what about the loafers?  What are they?  Yeah.  They're right here.  Gucci.  Those are definitely Gucci.  Gucci loafers? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  And Noah, you know, if you're going to have the expensive shoes, you should at least get  the jeans fitted.  I mean.  Well, mostly.  It's too long.  Let's see the shoes.  What do we got there?  Loafers with a little snaffle bit across the front.  Very nice.  Very nice.  What do those go for?  $420.  $420.  What kind of shoes are they?  Gucci.  They're Gucci.  Right.  Yeah.  So Daddy just buys all this stuff for you?  Yeah.  Do you say, Daddy, I want to go shopping?  Or does he buy you this stuff? 
[01:21:30]  Or do you just go?  Does he ask to see it?  No.  I go shopping myself.  You got a credit card?  Yeah.  And he pays.  And he pays.  And he pays.  Are you Daddy's big disappointment or he doesn't really care?  Not at all.  I'm just asking.  I don't know.  My dad's quite proud of me, actually.  Any brothers?  Yes, I have an older brother.  I remember coming home from college and I came home with an earring in my left ear and  my dad lost his effing mind and said, take that earring out of your ear while you're  living in this house.  And it was a lousy earring. 
[01:22:00]  What about the one in my schlong, Pop?  Yeah, right.  And at the time, it was something everybody was doing.  And so it wasn't even like out of the norm.  I can't imagine walking in and having my dad say me like this.  Hi, Dad.  Do you walk in to greet your father dressed like that?  My parents do not care.  Last year, I had four piercings up both ears.  I got rid of them.  My parents didn't care.  Wait, Veruca.  Let me ask you.  How much is the scarf?  The scarf?  $250.  Wait, wait. 
[01:22:30]  That's a $250 scarf?  And Ben is going up.  He's going higher.  Like what?  Three bills?  Someone added all this up.  Well, I mix it up.  How much is the H&M Jackson?  It's cheap.  It's like $60.  Yeah.  It's cheap.  Do you know that all my clothes, if I added them up, would maybe amount to $2,000?  That's if you threw your furniture in, too.  I know.  If I go shopping.  I'm not even kidding, dude.  For a thousand bucks.  Know how many different things I can wear before it adds up to $2,000? 
[01:23:00]  If I go out with a couple of grand to go shopping for clothes, I will have clothes for the year.  Like, it will just be that easy.  I will have so much clothing in my closet to wear on a daily basis.  For him, it's one day.  You said when you interviewed me I was more conservative.  I was wearing that same three-piece pinstripe suit.  I got to hand it to him.  Everyone knows Noah's name.  The tall intern that's been here four months has something to say.  Yes, sir.  I was just about to say.  That outfit is so annoying because it's so ridiculous and it gets you so much goddamn airtime. 
[01:23:30]  It makes me want to punch you.  Well, hold on.  Let's ask a little shorter than tall person.  How do you feel?  Yeah, I forgot his name, too.  I don't remember your name.  No, listen to what this guy.  What's your name again?  My name is Danny.  All right, Danny.  Hey, Danny.  Hi, Nathaniel.  Hi, Danny.  To be fair, that scarf came free with a bottle of poppers, I think.  Oh, wow.  Are you into poppers, Noah?  I don't even understand the reference. 
[01:24:00]  No, he doesn't do drugs.  No, I do drugs.  You're straight edge?  Well, not straight, but are you edge?  No, I don't do drugs.  Crystal meth.  Wow, man.  All right, well.  That is something.  You guys are going to have to do something to get more attention around here.  Nathaniel, I'm thinking you should come in as a cross-dresser.  That could be your thing.  Sweet.  Just start cross-dressing, and you'll get a lot of airtime like Noah.  I was hoping maybe my comedic abilities might get me some ass.  Stop it.  No, no, not at all. 
[01:24:30]  You're talking about something like talent?  Right.  Stop it.  Well, can I have any justification at all?  I mean, I do consider myself an artist a little bit.  That's right.  He does.  The artist.  No, no.  I do sing, and I do act, and so...  What have you acted in?  I've acted in different plays.  I acted in school.  Besides 20 years of telling your father, like, yeah, I have a girlfriend.  Unconvincingly.  Wow.  I see nothing wrong with... 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, what plays have you been in?  What plays have I been in?  I've been in Bye Bye Birdie.  I did Bye Bye Birdie.  What role did you play?  What role did I play?  In Bye Birdie?  I was the father.  Yeah.  All right.  And what else?  Anything else?  I was in Oliver.  Oliver.  Yes.  That wasn't a play.  He just met a guy named Oliver.  Yeah, he was in Oliver.  Dude.  People...  Never mind.  Why did...  I actually had to...  Oh, okay.  I think there's nothing wrong, especially in New York City, with dressing to stand out. 
[01:25:30]  Like, I don't like to blend in.  Right.  I mean, that's just the way I am.  I don't...  You know.  After him and his boyfriend finished, he went, please, sir, can I have some more?  Well, we found your band profile online.  Yeah.  You have a band?  Just an artist.  It's...  Can we say your last name?  Uh...  Rather not.  All right.  It's Noah somebody.  Actually, you can say that.  That's my...  That's your stage name?  That's what I mean.  That's our middle name.  Yeah, you can say that.  All right.  Noah Ross.  Yeah.  That's it.  Noah Ross. 
[01:26:00]  And your profile reads...  I got to tell you, the picture doesn't look anything like what I'm looking at right  now.  I was wearing a t-shirt in that picture, and I was trying to look like Rockstar for Garage  Band, so that was...  Rockstar?  That was totally posed for that.  All right.  Well, it says, I hail from...  I hail from big city New York.  But you're from Philly.  Yeah, but I've been here for the last four years.  Everyone loves saying they're from New York when you're trying to make it.  And I've been singing since I was six.  To me, there's nothing more exciting in the world than to get up on stage and put on a 
[01:26:30]  knockout performance.  I was classically trained for four years.  However, I have strayed a bit from the rules and boundaries of opera music.  Somehow, I got swept away by a love for soul.  Listening to Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, and Robert Plant made me rethink where I would  take my voice.  I love radio pop music, but it's got to have soul. 
[01:27:00]  If the singer doesn't feel it, how are his listeners?  That's a little odd way to put things.  If the singer doesn't feel it, how are the listeners?  Going to feel it.  To feel it, right.  Music is my life, and I am constantly writing music lyrics and working in my home studio.  And that's it.  Influenced by Led Zeppelin, Michael Jackson, Queen, George Michael, Peter Gabriel, U2, Queen. 
[01:27:30]  There's nothing wrong with Queen.  One of the greatest fans of all time.  I agree with that.  Not going to get in an argument for me.  Not one of the greatest, but they were good.  They were right up there, buddy boy.  Ozzy didn't have any.  A couple of songs that made them popular.  They were a little overrated.  A couple of songs overrated.  Yeah.  Wow.  They were overrated.  Songs were overrated.  They were.  You want to listen to Noah's song?  I would absolutely love to.  How is this done?  He's saying, oh no.  This is what you've been waiting for, so we're going to get it over with, so we can move  on with our radio show. 
[01:28:00]  Now music.  And you have taken over.  Where'd the music come from?  Where'd the music come from?  Over the summer, I was working at a record company, and I met some producer from...  Yeah, I'm sure you did.  From some Swedish producer.  Ooh, blonde and hairless.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Nice bubble bath filled with marmalade and scented oils.  He was much older than me in no way.  Yes, he was.  Of course he was.  He taught you.  I'm going to teach you a thing or two.  So I auditioned, and we did it.  We produced a song together, and that was about it.  But he put the tracks together? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, he put the tracks together.  And you wrote lyrics to this?  I just wrote lyrics, yeah.  And performed it to his music?  That's right.  This is you singing?  That's me singing.  What's the name of the song?  It's called Julia.  Julia.  Mm-hmm.  Isn't that the name of the girl you had sex with?  That's actually...  How come the end got dropped off the end?  All right.  It's about Downey and less than zero.  All right, now.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:29:00]  Oh.  Oh, lucky me.  I got you with me on the street.  Strolling down Third Avenue.  The other girls there.  Wanna put up a fight.  You're a wildcat out of the zoo.  Shame on my boyish mind.  Can't contain it. 
[01:29:30]  You're just my kind.  Choo-choo-choo Julia.  You're uncontrollable.  Got me cornered on the floor.  Got me crying out for my world.  So much intrigue for a pathetic boy like me.  To attract honey so sweet.  Twice my size.  Girl, you hypnotized me. 
[01:30:00]  Literally knocked me off my feet.  Shame on my boyish mind.  Can't contain it.  Can't contain it.  You're just my kind.  Choo-choo-choo Julia.  You're uncontrollable.  Got me cornered on the floor.  Got me crying out for my world.  Choo-choo-choo Julia.  You're uncontrollable. 
[01:30:30]  Got me cornered on the floor.  Got me crying out for my world.  Choo-choo-choo-choo Julia.  Come on now.  Julia.  Julia.  Julia.  Julia.  Julia.  Shame on my boyish mind. 
[01:31:00]  My boyish mind.  Can't contain it.  You're just my kind.  Choo-choo-choo Julia.  Choo-choo-choo Julia.  You're uncontrollable.  Whoa.  Got me cornered on the floor.  Got me crying out for my world.  Choo-choo-choo Julia.  Three simple words.  I am gay.  That's Noah, our intern, and his song Julia.  Gay.  Totally gay.  Liberace gay. 
[01:31:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  Who's men wanting to have sex with me?  Um, well, uh...  I...  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  Yeah.  I am speechless.  I am stupefied.  I am speechless.  I...  I, uh...  Um...  The instant feedbacks are flooding in.  Frank, gayest song ever. 
[01:32:00]  Uh...  He sounds like Cher.  Uh...  The singing...  This song makes me want to dance in a ball bag and grab my sack.  The sack of my pool boy.  Wow.  Turn it off.  Noah's latest song, Whole Lotta AIDS.  The people are freaking out over here.  I thought it had a nice ring to it. 
[01:32:30]  It was kind of poppy.  Ring?  His voice sounds like he's in the middle of gay sex.  That really did kind of have a gay sound to it.  I think that was like...  Why is Jim here the only one on my side all the time?  Because he's lying.  Noah, he's lying to your face.  No, I'm not lying to you.  I think...  I actually think it's not a bad song.  Yeah, I mean, if I had to be honest, it's definitely not my cup of tea.  I wouldn't go out and buy something like that.  And if I walked into a room and that was playing, I'd make sure I'd get the hell out of there immediately. 
[01:33:00]  But it's not bad.  It's not bad?  It's poppy.  It's...  Yeah, it's not something I would listen to, but...  Noah, your vocals were atrocious.  It was this operatic thing, this affectation on your voice at the...  You either sing opera or you sing pop.  And you can never put the two together.  There's this operatic, that... 
[01:33:30]  The little tremolo thing you were giving your voice at the end of that.  What about Queen?  What about Freddie Mercury?  That's a good point.  What about Freddie Mercury?  That's not opera.  Well, it was...  The guy has a rock quality to his voice.  It was rock, but he used opera.  It's different.  A lot of people can put the tremolo in their voice without it coming off sounding operatic.  It just...  I'm sorry.  It had this very gay sound to it.  My radio now smells like ass.  That just came in. 
[01:34:00]  Makes me wish I had my sailor's outfit.  He's the next David Hasselhoff.  Whoever had Spandau Ballet on their iPod is now admonished.  Wow.  Well, I guess they kind of like it.  That song made me just test positive.  Wow.  I truly appreciate the feedback.  It's very nice.  Well, it's about Julia.  Spandau Ballet.  A lot of references to Boy George. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Julia, kill yourself.  Getting all of them coming in here.  All right.  Well...  I don't think the girl I wrote this about actually knows about this song.  But...  I don't think this girl knows you.  Well, I'm going to disagree with that.  Had some sex with her.  Doesn't the girl have to be alive to know about you?  No one makes Boy George look like a lumberjack.  Sounds like queen. 
[01:35:00]  Drag queen.  So why don't you send a copy of this to Julia?  To Julia?  Yeah.  Because it's kind of embarrassing.  Why?  Well, where is Julia these days?  California.  What part?  Stanford.  Niagara Falls.  Ontario, Canada.  Did Mario Cantone write that?  I just fingered my own ass for the first time.  Yeah.  Well, okay.  Well, there you have it.  J-j-j-julia, everyone.  Any more songs? 
[01:35:30]  No, that was it.  Oh, that's too bad.  That was the first and last of your singing career.  Noah's song just got played on national radio.  I'd like to remind everybody I'll be at the open mic at the Boston Comedy Club tonight.  Welcome aboard, son.  What's your name again?  I hate you.  Oh, I'm Nathaniel, by the way.  Oh, hi, Nathaniel.  Nathaniel.  Yeah.  When did you start?  A couple weeks ago?  October.  When we started, Opie.  Oh, all right.  Well, he just doesn't get the attention that Noah gets.  I'm sorry.  I think that cross-dressing thing could work for you as far as getting attention around here. 
[01:36:00]  Sure.  He does a nice job, and so does Donnie, the other guy.  Yeah, it's Danny.  Oh, Danny.  All right.  Sorry, Danny.  Nice job.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm E-Rock, and he's primetime Sam Roberts.  But Sam, Noah's song, Julia, is that going to make hit bound on Sirius XM Hits 1?  I don't see that happening anytime soon, and I would know.  Well, it's a great pop song.  It isn't.  That's the problem.  It's not?  No.  I thought anyone loved it.  It's very bad.  That's the problem with it.  It's terrible.  Oh, so they were being ironic when they said they liked it. 
[01:36:30]  That's right.  Oh, okay.  They were being sarcastic.  But still to come, the saga of Noah continues with Rent Boys.  I don't remember what Rent Boys is.  Rent Boys is the book that Jim Norton brought in from home.  A friend had showed it to him.  It's a gay sex storybook.  It's like you read gay sex stories, and when it was time to punish people, Jim used to request  that certain staff members and interns read from Rent Boys.  Well, Noah's going to read from Rent Boys coming up next. 
[01:37:00]  That sounds exciting.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on the Virus Sirius XM.  You're here with us for the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am Iraq.  He is Sam.  No O&A today.  Prime time Sam Roberts.  Just trying to get on with the bit.  Well.  I don't know who you are.  I'm just moving along.  All right.  Well, anyway, we're doing the saga of Noah 2 from 2005.  This stuff hasn't seen the light of day since then, so we're now bringing it to you in  all its glory.  Noah's in studio.  What is he doing?  He's reading Rent Boys. 
[01:37:30]  Rent Boys.  That's something that we haven't heard in a while.  The very famous gay novel that Jim Norton brought to the show.  Well, it's stories.  It's not a novel.  It's a collection of short stories that Jim used to have people read as punishment.  Intern Noah reads from Rent Boys.  The gay sex storybook.  And it just sounds normal.  Turned me on a little bit.  A little bit?  Maybe a little more than that.  Here's the ever so sexy Intern Noah 2 reading from Rent Boys.  On the worst of Opie and Anthony.  When you say it, it just sounds creepy.  You have an erection.  You're weird. 
[01:38:00]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  My asshole is it.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  To this dummy.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  Are we ready for Noah?  Yep.  All right.  Okay.  Well, what's going on here, Anthony?  We're pretty much going to test Noah?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think we'll see.  This is an ongoing investigation.  There's plenty of circumstantial evidence, but no real hard evidence as to his preference. 
[01:38:30]  But he swears he had a girlfriend, Julia, and he wrote a song about her.  I know.  Sure he does.  Do you want me to play the song again?  Please no.  Okay.  Please no.  Just to prove that.  No.  You sure?  Positive.  Just a taste?  I don't ever want to hear that again.  I really don't ever want to hear that song again.  Just a little sample.  How's that?  Why would there be any reason for playing that?  Come on.  Just a little sample.  Because people are just waking up.  Yeah, exactly.  And maybe they didn't hear Noah's song, so we should just play a little piece of it 
[01:39:00]  here, okay?  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Oh, thank God.  Who didn't see that coming?  That's actually a little tougher than I remember it.  I like it.  All right.  Where is Noah?  Right here.  Wow.  Danny just pushed him really hard.  Danny's pushing him.  It's really getting mad.  Well, we have a paragraph from Rent Boys, which is that steamy gay novelette about boys and 
[01:39:30]  sex and none of those icky women thrown in there.  Yeah, this was something that Jimmy brought to the show.  No surprise there.  Yeah, as a punishment for the manly interns we have.  It's a book called Rent Boys, and when the interns messed up, we made them read from this  Rent Boys book.  It's funny.  It's embarrassing, because it's really hardcore gay stuff.  So what am I getting punished for is my question.  Will you shut up until we introduce you?  You're interrupting Ope just there. 
[01:40:00]  That's your punishment.  Oh, yes.  So the book went away for, I don't know, two months, right?  Mm-hmm.  And some were like, hey, where did that Rent Boys book go?  No one wanted to fess up to where it was, because no one wanted anyone else to know they  knew where it was.  So it had just disappeared.  It's like, oh, well, it's in my office in the drawer.  So we're all like, uh, I don't know.  Where is it?  Uh, whoever knows where it is is a homo.  Isn't that that gay book or something? 
[01:40:30]  Right.  It was so funny how no one would even attempt to tell where it was.  It's around here somewhere.  And then everyone may believe they really didn't know and started kicking things around.  Someone found it very quickly.  Yeah, who found it?  Who found it?  It was sitting on top of Jim's desk.  Who found it?  No, it wasn't.  We don't make things up here, Eric.  Where was it?  It was over there somewhere.  No, it wasn't.  It was...  It really was on Jim's desk?  Was it on Jim's desk?  Jim had it was sitting on Jim's desk.  It was not on my desk.  I don't have a desk.  My desk isn't arrived yet. 
[01:41:00]  They had that plastic play school desk that I can't use.  How do you write on a desk when there's little square and round holes in it to put the  pegs in with the plastic hammer?  That awful play school.  Yeah.  And they put...  Didn't they put little things on it?  I don't...  Like toys and stuff?  I don't go near it.  Like it was a bit or something they were trying.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  I know Bruce is ordering me another one.  I don't have a computer.  Nothing.  So I never spend time in the office.  No respect.  That's all right.  I don't even know why you need a desk and a computer.  You're here five minutes before the show starts and you're here maybe ten minutes after 
[01:41:30]  the show ends.  Maybe because he's got to leave right away to get to his computer.  Exactly.  Maybe if I had more time, I would be able to do a little bit of work here.  There you go.  Go on a drudge report?  Yeah.  You know, hey, a bit idea for tomorrow, boys.  Hey, I found something.  Found a little something.  A little something.  Well, here's a test we're going to do with Noah.  We got Rent Boys and then we got something from Penthouse Forum, I believe, right?  Uh-huh.  Penthouse Forum.  You know how these things are.  People write in these fake fantasies and push them off as real. 
[01:42:00]  Can I suggest that we start with the real hot Penthouse Forum letter and then end with  Rent Boys so everyone has that awful taste in their mouth?  You know who's reading this?  How hot do you think this is going to be?  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  How hot do you think a Penthouse Forum letter is going to be with him reading it?  Well, the whole thing is, the whole test here is the comparison.  So which one do you want him to read first, Anthony?  Um, well, might as well let him read the one that's going to make him puke first. 
[01:42:30]  That would be the Penthouse Forum.  Penthouse, right.  Obviously.  Okay.  Noah, you're an actor, right?  Yep.  I am an actor.  So, uh, you see the highlighted paragraphs of Penthouse Forum?  Yep.  Why are you going?  Where's mine?  Because it involves girls.  This is supposed to be really hot.  No, this is like storytelling time.  It's a little weird.  But you're an actor, right?  Yeah.  So you could really present this as dialogue and not just reading it all monotone, right? 
[01:43:00]  And why are you still wearing the $300 scarf?  Because it's $300.  He doesn't trust any of us.  Earlier.  Daniel, take it and hock it.  Earlier, you said that it's because you just came from outside.  Yeah.  I've got to take it off.  All right, Noah.  We're ready.  Okay.  Give it your all.  All right.  I'll read along.  So this is the Penthouse one?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Get into character now.  You're a heterosexual male. 
[01:43:30]  Really work it.  That's not going to be too hard, but okay.  Obviously.  I'm not reading from this.  All right.  I pulled off her pants and panties.  I took off her shirt and used to gag her mouth.  She was left with only her bra, and I told her she was now my slave.  This is your acting?  Dude, start over, man.  This is like acting?  Okay.  There are guys in their car that just want a jacket. 
[01:44:00]  Read this like dialogue.  Now picture this scene.  All right.  You're one of these kiss-and-tell guys.  You're a guy with his buddy.  You're sitting at the bar.  You railed this girl that both of you have been looking at, right?  You're like a construction worker.  Yeah.  You're a construction worker.  Just off the job, you went for a few pops at the local tavern.  You're crass and rude.  You have no...  You don't hold back to your friends with the sex stories.  You tell them.  So you got to kind of, you know, you lean over to them.  You've done a couple of shots, and now you're explaining what happened that night with this 
[01:44:30]  chick.  All right.  I think I needed that motivation, but now I can do better.  No problem.  Her name is Julia.  Julia.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Okay.  Let's go.  Okay.  I pulled off her pants and panties.  I took off her shirt and used to gag her mouth.  She was left with only her bra, and I told her she was now my slave.  She nodded her approval, and I caught her raw.  Her breasts were two huge pillows with dark, chunky nipples. 
[01:45:00]  I began licking and sucking those sweet titties, biting her left nipple while squeezing the  right.  She was squirming, and I realized she was having a massive organism while I dominated her.  By now, my cock was so hard, it was painful.  I dropped my pants underwear without warning, plunged my nine-inch tool off my neck.  I dropped her pussy.  The gag in her mouth muffled her screams as I popped her cherry.  I began pumping and biting her tits so hard that when I came, I left teeth indentations  in her nipples. 
[01:45:30]  That's the next paragraph.  The next one.  The next paragraph.  Yeah.  We both came at the same time.  She passed out while I filled with my sperm cocktail.  After a few seconds, she came around, and I instructed her that she was my slave, and that she was to  move into my home.  She obediently called home and told her mother to bring her belongings over to my place.  I don't like the way you don't say words completely.  Like, she obediently called home and told her mother to bring her belongings over to my  place.  You don't say the words. 
[01:46:00]  Belongings.  He just doesn't...  Belongs.  Oh, being like...  After that reading, I got an inny.  Oh.  Yeah.  That was the worst.  I'm going to have to blame that on my training in a journalism school.  It's not the best.  Training in journalism school?  Yeah.  There was no emotion to that whatsoever.  Yeah.  It was a very monotone delivery.  I had a bigger ride when Cronkite...  Cronkite.  Oh.  Oh, at least you didn't say Cronkite.  Cronkite gave a sexier proclamation of JFK's death was what I was going. 
[01:46:30]  Cronkite.  Took his glasses off.  That was hot.  Yeah.  Cronkite.  Cronkite.  Oh, you horrible.  He's disgusted with himself.  Yeah, there was really no...  I wasn't feeling that.  I didn't feel any sincerity in it.  You know?  I felt like you were reading this without really any first-hand knowledge of what was  going on in there. 
[01:47:00]  Well, it's a first-time read.  I mean, I guess I practiced it a little bit.  It might have been...  Or if you did it once.  Yeah.  Well, okay.  If you practiced.  Maybe we can do better with Rent Boys.  All right.  Maybe we can.  Jimmy, Rent Boys.  Where is the paragraph that Jimmy has...  This was highlighted quite a while ago.  Starting right there and finishing right there.  How long is it?  Is it just as long as the one he just read?  Yes.  Now, again...  A lot shorter, actually.  Let's get some motivation here.  Yes.  Again, now you're in a bar. 
[01:47:30]  Where would this be?  What location are we looking at here in Manhattan?  Well, if Noah says, what's my motivation?  It's Thursday.  Okay.  So, you're at a...  Yeah, what's a good gay bar here in the city?  Christopher Street.  There you go.  The duplex.  You're hanging out.  Wait, did you say Christopher Street?  You're a gay man.  Let's just...  Now you're acting.  You're a gay man.  Just acting.  And you're hanging out at this bar on Christopher Street, and another gay man's next to you. 
[01:48:00]  And again, you're just telling him what happened the night before, trying to get each other  a little hot as you sit there and sip your Cosmo.  And now, if you will, read from Rent Boys.  Rent Boys.  Here we go.  That's really motivating.  Everybody, compare it to his reading from Penthouse Forum.  All right.  If you will.  Give it some emotion.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  I'll give it a shot.  All right.  Swallowing it and sucking it as if I could coax more juice from the slit.  I closed and opened my eyes to look up his ripped, fur-coated abs and hard, flat chest. 
[01:48:30]  I saw his pale green eyes looking lackadaisically back just before his lids closed shut.  When his fingers knotted in my hair, he guided me across the expanse of his massive cock,  making me learn its dimensions and texture with my tongue.  By the time he pulled it out and slapped it lightly against my cheek and nose, I knew everything  about him.  I kissed his full, smooth nuts, sniffing at the dark, tangled hair above his cock as 
[01:49:00]  he rolled a condom over his crown and downed his shaft.  I bent to get a bottle of lube from the bag and slowly stroked clear fluid up and down his  hard, twitching cock.  Without saying a word, John took the bottle from me, held it near his cock, letting the  slick gel drip down to his crotch.  All right, I'll admit, man, this is intern abuse at this point.  Wow.  All right, now let's, let's, that was interesting, and I appreciate you sharing that with us.  Now let's get the book. 
[01:49:30]  Of course.  Yeah.  Now read from the book.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  You know, I gotta say, I gotta say, there was a, and I'm not drawing any conclusions here.  Because we really don't know, and quite frankly, it doesn't matter, and we don't really care.  Nothing matters either way, it doesn't, and I'm not drawing conclusions, but all I'm saying  is there did seem to be a hint more emotion, familiarity in that reading than there was 
[01:50:00]  in the penthouse reading.  Now, maybe you could attribute that to, you know, the penthouse was your first reading,  and this one's your second.  Yeah.  One was a reading, and one was a memory.  Yeah, you seemed a bit more nervous with the second reading.  You seemed more comfortable, and there was more emotion when you said cock than when  you said your nine-inch tool in her pussy, you know?  It just seemed like you emphasized cock. 
[01:50:30]  Like when you said that the other gentleman slapped your face with it and made you learn  its textures.  With your tongue.  That seemed, you know, there was a hint of, ah, yes, I recall this.  That's right, the old learning process.  You know?  And with your penthouse read, it was kind of like, huh, what is this?  Hi, what? 
[01:51:00]  I'm, I hope you did what with?  The other reading, it sounded to me like you were just saying hi to an old friend.  An old lubed-up friend smacking in the cheek.  I think I should get another shot at the penthouse, maybe sometime.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe sometime.  Maybe we can do that at some later date.  Yeah.  Not that it was a bad read, but when you're describing her body and you start retching a  little bit, that kind of makes us think that you're not into it.  Oh my God. 
[01:51:30]  Herp.  Herp.  Herp.  Herp.  Herp.  Herp.  All right.  Well, bang-up job, Noah.  His furry abs.  Furry abs.  Smooth, nutsack, Herp.  All right.  Well, thank you, Noah.  I'm sorry, Dad, if you're listening.  Hump X from Rhode Island wants to know what Christopher Street is.  He has no clue, I guess.  Is there a Rhode Island reference to him? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, Rhode Island.  Rhode Island.  It's a place here in Manhattan.  It's a street in an area that a lot of gay men frequent.  Isn't there a big gay area in Rhode Island or something?  Providence.  It's supposed to be like a big...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think there's a lot of dykes in Rhode Island, right?  You might be thinking of Provincetown.  Provincetown.  Right.  Yeah, Providence.  Which is the tip of Cape Cod.  Noah, very, very interesting, to say the least. 
[01:52:30]  Thank you.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am E-Rock, and this is Primetime Sam Roberts, as always.  Yeah.  And we're doing the saga of Noah II, continuing on.  Now, we have Noah in studio, but we introduce him to former intern Francine.  Well, Noah is the intern that we were...  And one of many interns that's come through here, that we were convinced was gay.  This is stuff that hasn't been heard since 2005.  So we brought Francine in to assess.  We needed the female point of view on this. 
[01:53:00]  Now, this bit might clear up a lot of things for a lot of people, because we do make a reference  to this incident once in a while, but we never really fully explained where it came from.  This is where Noah was wearing this really expensive outfit, and he had Gucci boots on.  And Opie said...  Gucci!  Opie wanted to see his boots, had him put them up on the table, and he threw something  that stained that boot.  It was classic, it was memorable, it was hilarious.  And it's here for you, for the first time in five years, the Intern Noah saga continues. 
[01:53:30]  You're listening to the worst of people in Anthony's show.  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  On Sirius XM.  I know he's in studio.  Why do you think he's gay?  He's saying he's not gay.  Exactly.  He looks like a huge fag.  Big, fat fag.  If he says he's not a fag, I guess I'll take his word for it, but he looks like he belongs  on Christopher Street.  He's just village gay.  Just gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.  Well, you told me you heard my song and you thought it was gay.  Why is that? 
[01:54:00]  I don't think I can explain.  Oh, my God.  The voice is a little...  I gotta tell you, Noah, the voice is a little, you know...  That's pretty funny.  She just said, she goes, I don't think I have to explain.  Like, he's speaking for himself right there.  The song wasn't gay.  What did you think was gay, the song?  Julia?  Julia was...  Oh.  Flaming.  Flaming.  Do you like his outfit with the pink shirt and stuff today?  Yeah, I think it's nice if he... 
[01:54:30]  If it's a gay thing, you know, it looks really good.  For gay.  Yeah, for gay, it looks great.  I don't see why it's gay at all.  I think you have to explain why you think it's gay.  But you also have on sunglasses and it's like...  I always wear sunglasses.  That's gay, too.  I know a lot of people that wear sunglasses.  And you're wearing pink.  You're wearing pink.  Yeah, so this shirt is like what P. Diddy and like Fat Joe.  That's like the hot style.  Not necessarily gay, just because it's gay.  How about P. Enos? 
[01:55:00]  One thing I'm noticing, though, that is very not gay about him, I'm noticing your fingernails are a little dirty.  Now, gay guys are usually very meticulous.  Yeah, but his are dirty from holding ass cheeks open.  Oh, my God.  And you think he belongs on Christopher Street?  Definitely.  And why is that?  I don't know, but you've got to watch out for the AIDS. 
[01:55:30]  Sonny Cockett.  Oh, my God.  He says he's not.  So let me ask you, I mean, besides seeing the way I was dressed when you first met me, do you think my personality was gay, too?  Well, you look gay, too.  No, no, not my looks.  I'm saying my personality when I first talked to you.  Yeah, you sound gay.  You look and sound gay and sing gay.  You kind of got the gay...  You're just gay.  I got to say, you got the gay voice.  Definitely.  It's kind of a...  You got this, like, very feminine...  It's like swishy... 
[01:56:00]  You talk like that.  You ever hear a gay guy talk?  Yes, I do.  And have you ever said, wow, that guy sounds gay?  Yeah, absolutely.  That's what you sound like.  Like, you don't hear that?  Nobody's ever told me that.  Stereotypically, yeah, you have the gay voice.  You have the gay voice.  Your mannerisms are very gay.  Nobody's ever told me that before.  Ever.  They've thought it.  Yeah, they're just not being honest, or they are so much more gay than you that you sound butch.  People are honest with me. 
[01:56:30]  Welcome to reality.  All my friends and roommates are straight.  I mean, they would tell me if they thought that I acted or talked gay.  No, they wouldn't.  They would just laugh at you behind your back at parties.  That's true.  And tease whoever your roommate was.  Where's your roommate?  Come on, man.  I didn't bring you.  Shut up.  You see the way that guy talks, man?  Yeah.  All right.  Well...  It's very gay.  Hubblubblubblubblub.  Wow.  Francine.  Jesus.  Francine.  We really don't know.  Yeah.  We don't know.  We have no hard facts to back this up. 
[01:57:00]  I'm going to have to say I'm still on the fence with Noah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm not really sure.  Noah's on the fence, too, and he's got the post stuck right in his crack.  Two feet dangling, not touching anything.  On the other side of the knot hole in the fence on his knees.  That's a pleasant thought.  Waiting for that prize.  All right.  Well...  Prize.  How much is your outfit today, by the way?  Yes.  Give us a rundown of what you're wearing.  What are you wearing?  Those are cool boots.  These are Gucci boots. 
[01:57:30]  How much are the...  Dan corrected.  How much are the...  How much are the Gucci boots that guy he bought you?  Pretty expensive.  They were about $500.  Pop one up over here if you could...  $500.  How high up did I go, sweetie?  Not that high.  $500?  We've got $500 for Gucci boots.  Yes.  And I got a banana jacket.  This was a...  I didn't see the boot.  Opie wants to see the boot.  Put it on the counter.  Put it on the counter.  Put it on the counter.  I'm going with you.  There you go. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, Jesus.  He hit it.  That is a strategy.  He just threw a chocolate-cover strawberry at his boot.  At his $500 Gucci boot.  It smashed right on the...  Oh, what a dick.  What a great shot that dick has, though.  I really appreciate that.  Thank you.  He smashed on his $500 Gucci boot.  That was great.  And what about the jacket and the shirt?  Give us the details. 
[01:58:30]  The jacket and the shirt are both from Banana Republic.  Banana Republic?  Yes.  So they're relatively inexpensive?  The jacket was $250.  $250.  Wait, is anyone doing the math?  $750 so far.  Yeah, $750.  What about the shirt?  The shirt was $80.  $80 for the shirt?  Uh, this t-shirt was $40.  $870.  $40 t-shirt?  For a plain t-shirt.  Yeah, but that's what's happening out there with the t-shirts.  Yeah.  And the jeans are diesel, so they were like $140, $130.  Dude, your outfit is over $1,000. 
[01:59:00]  $1,010.  What about socks?  You got chocolate on the sleeve of your thing, though.  It popped up.  No, that's some kind of thread thing.  Oh, okay.  That's not chocolate.  What is that?  Some thread.  I have no idea.  All right.  You might have to burn the jacket now.  How much are the socks?  Yeah, what about your socks?  I just wear normal white socks.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  No dress socks?  No dress socks.  And what about the sunglasses?  How much are those?  The sunglasses are $250.  Can I ask you a question?  Are those button fly pants?  Yes, they are.  I have the same jeans. 
[01:59:30]  What?  Diesel button fly?  Yeah, those are actually cool jeans.  Thank you.  How much did you pay for them?  Probably $140.  You spent $140 on jeans?  $140 for a pair of jeans?  Yeah, from me and Bob Kelly went shopping Monday.  And I bought a pair of diesel jeans, yes.  What do you think $140 jeans are going to get you, Jimmy?  No, I actually like them.  They're actually comfortable.  They look good on stage.  They are very comfortable.  Oh, stage wear.  All right.  But no, yeah, that's what I wear.  No, that's okay.  Then I'm fine with it.  For the stage, that's one thing.  Yeah.  I thought you were just wearing them around thinking you'd feel better about yourself 
[02:00:00]  just walking the streets dressed in $140 jeans.  No, not wearing one of the Tonight Show.  And I'm not bashing you.  I'm just saying I would be the same way.  I wouldn't wear it because what the hell is that going to get you?  But Tonight Show on stage, fine.  Where will you be performing?  Fellatio.  Me?  Exactly.  The hands just went up in the air.  The hands went up in this fashion you would only see at La Cage.  Like somebody was robbing me.  No, that was just like, I'm not just confused.  I'm not performing.  See, your hand motions, your mannerisms. 
[02:00:30]  I, too, am not saying you're gay because I have no hard facts to back it up with.  But everything you do, and what did so you say mean?  Well, you said you have no hard facts to back it up, but you're coming up with hard facts.  No, they're not hard facts.  It's all circumstantial evidence.  Okay.  Okay.  But hard facts is like a picture of you blowing a guy.  Okay.  Well, no, that, too, can be taken.  Of course, that's hard facts.  But the way you move your arms when you're talking. 
[02:01:00]  I don't walk around like this and do this.  That would be more masculine if you switch your wrist like that.  No, I never.  I don't do this.  You kind of do when you talk.  The hand on the hip thing.  I'm not doing that.  But you were.  And you will again.  And your voice, I mean, they're, yeah, just saying.  Guys, there's two guys.  There's two regular guys standing out there that don't know you from a hole in the wall.  Okay. 
[02:01:30]  What, what's, do you, does he seem gay?  Got to wait for the delay to catch up.  Look, turn around.  Look at the blithering idiots sitting out there looking at us.  One in a Phillies hat, one in a Yankees hat.  Yeah.  Okay.  Get out.  You guys making the universal signal for a blowjob where you take the empty hand in  a ring, do it, and put your tongue on your cheek so it pops out, would you?  Is this the gay judging paddle over here?  Well.  The American Idol paddle?  The guys kind of know.  They're saying, yeah. 
[02:02:00]  Okay.  All right.  They're saying you're a swish.  All right, Noah.  Thank you.  Anytime.  I will defend you.  I have no idea.  I think we should switch shirts.  Oh, very funny.  He should put the low self-esteem and we'll give blowjob for a friendship.  Oh, I don't have low self-esteem, so.  No?  You should.  Well, thank you, Shiloh.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Thank you.  No problem.  His outfit's like $1,200 today.  $1,200.  Mine is maybe $40.  Nice jeans.  No.  I got the same one.  Oh, you totally nailed him. 
[02:02:30]  Of course I did.  Oh.  Did you ever see that girl again that you were talking about the other day?  Remember the one you hooked up with?  Went back to her place?  No, I have not.  You haven't seen her again?  What was her name?  Yeah, what was her name?  Well, the one that I didn't remember or the one?  Oh, the one you didn't remember.  What was the girlfriend's name?  Girlfriend's name?  Are we talking about Julia?  All right, Julia.  But no, there's the girl and you met her.  Where was that again?  Where did I meet her at?  Yeah, where did you meet her?  Central Bar. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's, I forget where that is.  It's like 9th Street in the village.  Where did she live, though?  Yeah.  No idea.  No, you went to her place.  I don't remember.  You don't remember?  Oh, yeah.  Where?  What?  It was like 30th Street between 8th and 9th.  Who, helping him?  No.  I don't remember what you're talking about.  This is the best real ever, man.  This is the best. 
[02:03:30]  No matter what.  No matter what.  He just looks all like, oh, I gotta remember what I said.  Yeah.  No one believes any of it.  Okay.  Thank you.  No problem.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  You had sex the first time where?  Sex the first time where?  At a friend's party in high school?  Right.  It was a part.  On the couch?  Yes.  In front of people.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Why do I have to go through this memory tense?  No, no, no.  Just not.  I forgot.  I'm sorry.  Right.  Okay.  I have a bad memory.  That's great.  Just when we thought it was.  I forgot. 
[02:04:00]  No, no.  I remember.  It was 30th.  Well, that's the best part of the thing.  It's like, just when you think you got him, he comes up with the answer.  He comes up with the answer.  At the last possible second.  Piss me off every time.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Well, Sam, we're about to wrap up this saga known as Noah 2.  We have one more spot to play right after the break.  It's a bit dramatic.  Noah's final impact on the Opie and Anthony Show when we return.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:04:30]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  ONA not here today, so you're stuck with us too.  Better this way.  It is.  It's much better this way.  Sam, we are going to conclude now the saga known as Noah 2.  What happens in this final segment?  Well, it's the announcement that Noah has officially resigned.  He had had enough of the torment and abuse, which every intern is privy to here at the  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:05:00]  But Noah resigned, and Opie kind of gets into the fact that maybe the reason he was picking  on Noah was because he grew up so poor.  Then he gets into this story that I think he stole from Fez.  Oh, is this the one about the sandwich bags?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's definitely a Fez story.  Here it is.  Opie is poor.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Kill yourself.  Kill yourself.  On the virus.  Kill yourself.  Sirius XM.  Kill yourself.  Yeah, so Noah, the intern, has quit. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, wow.  You just let that info right out.  Yeah, because we got to move on.  It's kind of a bummer.  Yeah.  You know, we were having a lot of fun with Noah.  He was our intern that, you know, would dress very, very nicely for the radio program.  He was probably the most flamboyant intern we've had.  And we had a lot of fun with him, and we kept asking him, you know, off air, are you cool  with this and this and that.  He loved the attention and all, but I don't know what happened. 
[02:06:00]  But basically, we find out that Noah's not going to intern here anymore.  So, I don't know what's going on.  That was that.  Right.  He has left the program.  Yeah, there were a lot of times, off air, kind of pull him aside and go, dude, you okay  with this?  You know?  Right.  Just making sure.  He was loving the airtime, but I don't know.  Yesterday, it seemed to just all of a sudden turn.  Because when we were talking to him late in the show yesterday, I mean, I saw his face. 
[02:06:30]  It was getting all red and weird and stuff.  Like, he was getting...  Maybe his father had had a chat with him beforehand.  Yeah, he was getting uncomfortable or something.  I don't know.  And then I threw a strawberry at his shoe.  But, I mean, you know, I do stuff like that all the time.  Sure.  You threw poker chips at some lady.  Well, we mess with the interns a lot.  I just was annoyed that he had $500 shoes on.  You're a little jealous.  I don't have $500 shoes.  Who does?  I guess I could go out and get them now.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Why not?  Let's get some Gucci shoes.  We'll all throw chocolate covered strawberries at. 
[02:07:00]  Sucker Pat, he gave us the...  Yeah.  She gave us the chocolate covered strawberries yesterday for Valentine's Day.  And we ate a few.  And then I was full.  And then I was annoyed because I saw his really nice shoe.  And we set him up nicely.  You guys made sure that the shoe was on the counter.  Right up on the console.  And I pelted it.  I actually thought you just wanted to see it.  No, not at all.  I got to be honest.  I thought you just wanted to see it, too.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you guys throwing me under a bus?  No.  Not at all.  I howled when I saw that strawberry.  No, that's what made it so much more funny to me. 
[02:07:30]  I wasn't expecting it.  I do like him, though.  He kept lifting his foot up and not really putting it up on the console.  When are you going to expect it?  I know.  That's just it.  You're lunatic.  How can you prepare yourself for $500 shoes having a chocolate covered treat thrown at  them?  No one expects it on any level.  No.  Chocolate covered treat.  I got to say, I'm bummed that Noah has decided to leave the program.  Yeah.  So am I.  You know, maybe he'll reconsider and come back and he could still intern. 
[02:08:00]  We'll just leave him off the air or whatever, but we'll see what happens with that.  You know, I thought he was cool with everything that was going on.  I defended him.  I had no idea what he was.  We were having fun with that.  It was a nice bit and a nice angle.  We're always looking for angles and bits on this radio show.  Yeah, honestly, we have no clue and really could care less what anyone's sexual orientation  on this show is.  The whole thing was he would just come in on a daily basis dressed.  I was more annoyed, I'll be honest, because I was brought up really poor. 
[02:08:30]  Poor.  Extremely poor.  And I was just really annoyed that he had such nice clothes at his age.  Jesus.  That bothered you?  Yes.  Dude, I had the same shoes for a year at a time, man, where there were holes in them.  We were so poor and we got haircuts for a while there once a year.  Opie, don't hate the player.  I hate the game.  So there was always something in me going, wow.  That bothers you to this day?  Rich kids?  I always hated rich kids. 
[02:09:00]  Yes.  Wow.  I mean, you know, my dad got me, when I got my driver's license, he got me a Dodge Aspen  Wagon.  Ooh.  That was older than dirt, man.  And I was proud of the car, you know.  But the problem was where we lived, you know, on Long Island, we lived in kind of a middle  to upper middle class neighborhood.  Yep.  But we were like on the low end, on the way low end, and having seven kids.  Yeah.  So I'm driving this Dodge Aspen Wagon to school, really old, so old that the back doors, they 
[02:09:30]  didn't close anymore, so there was a metal wire.  What?  You want to talk about safety.  A metal wire that went from door to door in the back seat.  To hold the back doors closed.  Yeah.  And so if I was, you know, driving some of my friends to school, they would jump in  and they would have-  In the back seat?  Yeah, and the only way to sit in the back seat, you had to, like, sit, you know, behind  the metal wire.  Get out of here.  Swear to you, bro.  You realize it would be like an egg slicer if you got in an accident. 
[02:10:00]  I know.  They would just be cut in half.  But that was my dad's logic.  He was always, you know, he was like MacGyver.  Wow.  You know, ah, the doors, you know, instead of, like, maybe setting it to-  Fixing the door.  To the garage, it probably would have cost 20 bucks.  No, my dad's way of doing things was go out to his garage and find a way to fix it himself.  Did they have to climb in from the front into the back seat?  Yeah.  Just hop over the front seat into the back, have the metal wire across from door to door, 
[02:10:30]  and they would sit like that.  No one cared.  That is really, really rigged.  And then I would drive to Harborfields High School, you know, park in the student parking  lot, and then here comes everybody else, and they're brand new Beamers and what have  you.  Yeah.  Volvos that daddy bought them.  Oh, here it comes.  So that's where the hatred comes from.  Well, it's not a-  Rich kids.  It's not a hatred, but-  Ooh, the rich kid doesn't have a big wire in his back seat. 
[02:11:00]  Well, and the rich kid got to buy, you know, a nice hot lunch at school while we were eating  our bruised apples and our Pepperidge Farm peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  Remember the Pepperidge Farm bread?  That was the worst bread ever.  My mom bought it-  It was pre-stale.  It was pre-stale because, yeah, it was cheap because it was ready to be thrown in the dumpster  is what it was.  Yeah.  And it was thin to begin with.  Real thin.  It was hard, and then you'd get, like, fresh Wonder Bread. 
[02:11:30]  It's like a cloud.  Oh, soft and doughy.  That fresh, brand new Wonder Bread.  The only time I got Wonder Bread-  Never got that, did you?  No.  Maybe when I went over at a friend's house or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, no, man.  And then it would be-  Then I-  Pepperidge Farm bread.  I only figured this out recently because of Jim's apple thing.  Yeah.  That we always had apples with a bruise on it.  One bruise, peanut butter and jelly sandwich on Pepperidge Farm, wafer-thin bread with the 
[02:12:00]  jelly soaking through.  Ugh.  And, like, you know, we've joked about this in the past, but as the God's honest truth,  I'll get, you know, one of my four brothers on the phone, one of my two sisters, no problem.  I mean, we didn't have the sandwich bag.  So it was whatever my mom could find to wrap up these sandwiches.  Wait, to wrap up the sandwiches or to put it in a bag?  Like, you had your paper sandwich bag, and then you had it in Saran Wrapper Ziploc bags. 
[02:12:30]  Stop.  What was your sandwich wrapped in?  Not even tinfoil.  What was it wrapped in?  Just whatever bags were laying around.  Maybe an old bread bag.  Whatever.  Bags from shopping.  So it was the big plastic bag from, you know, the grocery store.  So she'd wrap it in that a bunch of times.  Oh, God.  Dude, I went to school with really big brown Wallbaums bags.  Like the big shopping bag with your little lunch bag?  Yeah.  Where most of the time the parents would buy you the lunch bags.  There were bags specially made for lunch. 
[02:13:00]  Please.  Stop.  You'd get the big Wallbaums grocery bag.  You'd hear the apple roll from end to end.  I'm not kidding.  Rolling over the sandwich, soaking more jelly through it.  Oh, do kids make fun of you at the table when you pull down that monstrosity?  No, because when you're in that situation as a kid, I think you learn ways to kind of  hide that type of thing.  Wow, that is brutal.  I'll give you that. 
[02:13:30]  And, you know, if we got lunch money, it was a real treat.  You know, to some real poor kid, you know, kicking with no shoes on in Kansas, that probably  sounds like a luxury.  But if people understood Harborfields, this is like very rich people, very wealthy.  Well, I wouldn't say very, but upper middle class.  But, yeah, they're doing very well.  Definitely upper middle class.  Yeah, they're doing very well.  Yeah.  So that's the curse is, you know, being on the low end of whatever.  Yeah.  You know. 
[02:14:00]  So you had to see some kids.  It wasn't about not having money.  Like, if all my friends didn't have money and the school district, then it wouldn't matter.  You just wouldn't, because you're used to the people you hang out with.  Simple as that.  You had no fruit cup?  You didn't get a fruit cup.  Stop.  No pudding?  Stop.  You pop top the pudding and nothing like that?  It was mostly an apple and peanut butter and jelly.  And the apple was bruised, why?  Because always bruised.  And I was thinking maybe there was some kind of sale.  A discount on the bruised apples, maybe. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, jeez.  You were poor.  You were poor.  And then I told you about the jeans that never faded.  Jeans that never faded.  What was the jean store in Huntington?  Columbus, was it?  This goes back a while, but, you know, the jeans that fade.  Sure, you want them to fade.  In junior high, all my friends have the jeans that fade.  And then eventually, you know, holes in the knees.  Yeah, it starts fraying and stuff.  How cool is that? 
[02:15:00]  Those are cool.  Right?  Yeah.  And my jeans never faded.  I never understood why.  It was because there was those other jeans.  The fake jeans?  The fake jeans?  Remember the fake blue jeans?  Yeah.  They're coming back a little bit, actually.  They never fade.  But I didn't know that.  You didn't have, you know.  And I would just sneak mine in the wash over and over again, sneaking it past, you know?  Yeah.  Because laundry was a big deal in our house, too.  But I would sneak that pair.  What was the big deal about laundry?  Dude, seven kids, figure it out.  My mom was literally doing laundry every hour of the day. 
[02:15:30]  Really?  Just constantly washing?  So it was like, look, man, you know, wear your jeans more than once.  Please help me out here, type of thing.  So, you know, I would sneak them in, though, because I wanted these damn things to fade.  They never faded.  They never faded.  Now, you must have been a hand-me-down family, too.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of the clothes went down the line.  Oh, yeah.  Whew.  Yeah, and someone's reminding me on the line.  Yeah, that is the God's honest truth.  Oh, my God, that's right.  I once brought lunch to school in a cement bag. 
[02:16:00]  That is the truth.  Because my dad was really into cementing.  Like those bags of sacrete and stuff that you'd get at the hardware store to do, like, your sidewalk.  He was insane with the cement work.  Loved cement.  My brothers were convinced he'd start this whole cement thing to keep us busy.  Just keep it like a prison detail?  Oh, yeah, because we had to go find the sand.  Did he have any Italian in him?  No, no.  Italian's always with the cement.  No, he was building rock walls and paths that led to nowhere and more paths. 
[02:16:30]  Dude, I don't think you've ever been to my family house, no?  Wapping it off, sir.  Wapping it off, boss.  He would buy the cement bags, like, I don't know, ten at a time.  It was ridiculous.  And then we had these sand pits.  We had actual sand pits.  To mix the cement?  Yeah.  Our job was to get the sand to mix into the cement.  This is crazy.  So then the cement bags were laying around, and I guess one day we were real desperate, 
[02:17:00]  and I actually brought my lunch to school.  In one of the empty cement bags?  Yeah.  Was there all cement dust in it?  Yes, definitely.  A little bit.  You broke that out at the lunch table?  Well.  And dust, cement dust goes everywhere?  That's horrible.  That's child abuse.  Was it child abuse?  That is child abuse.  You do what you can when you have seven kids.  Do what you can.  Find another bag other than a cement bag. 
[02:17:30]  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  I used to feel bad that sometimes I had to cover my books with brown paper bag.  Sometimes?  Book covers.  Yeah, because sometimes I'd get the real cool book covers, you know?  I never got a book cover.  Never got the book cover from school?  No.  No.  Stop.  A traffic keeper?  No.  Never had a good loose one?  My science book said wall bounds on the front.  It was always wall bounds.  Brown paper bag.  Wow, that's brutal, man.  You were poor.  It's the hatred.  So maybe yesterday a little of that came out. 
[02:18:00]  When you saw that Gucci shoe on his foot, $500 Gucci shoe, did you think about your cement  bag lunch?  I thought about bruised apples.  Your beverage farm bread soaked with jelly.  I thought about the margarine and sugar sandwiches at the beach house.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I did.  Oh, all that anger came out in that one chocolate-covered strawberry.  Feeling good about where my life has taken me.  Yeah.  But it all came back in that moment. 
[02:18:30]  And that anger.  As soon as that glistening shoe came up on the console, it was over, Johnny.  Cliff is saying they're tough-skinned jeans or something like that.  Oh, tough-skins, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Those were like, yeah, the heavy denim that just never faded.  It was denim from through and through.  No, it was made not to fade.  Yeah, but I didn't understand that as a kid.  Yeah, and they were...  They didn't rip, either.  They were real thick denim.  Yeah. 
[02:19:00]  Tough-skins.  Those were awful.  Oh, but the cement work and the...  Oh, my dad was an amazing guy.  What would he have you make?  Like, a lot of rock walls to begin with.  Rock walls.  A lot of rock walls and then pathways all around the house and then a pathway from the back  door to the garage that was separated from the house.  Oh.  And then a pathway that kind of led up into the woods but just stopped.  Just stopped once you hit the woods?  Yeah.  It was just all these cement paths everywhere. 
[02:19:30]  Wow.  My younger brother jokes that we didn't have bedrooms.  We had barracks.  He'd call you up early in the morning, blow the bugle, and then you're out with the wheelbarrow  and shovels.  We had the Volkswagen bus that, on a Saturday or Sunday, my dad would go, hey, we're going  for a ride, and we'd get all excited as little kids.  You had a Volkswagen minibus?  Yeah, those hippie buses.  Yeah, the hippie buses.  Yeah, and then he'd load us up, and the seats were out of it so we could fit more people. 
[02:20:00]  The doors closed so you didn't have any wires?  Yeah, the door...  No, but the door closed, but there were no seats.  So you were just, like, tumbling around?  No joke.  Like little apples in bags.  I laugh at these parents with their stupid safety.  Yeah, stupid safety.  And their minivans and stuff.  Like, Elo was driving us, and his hooptie.  Yeah.  His whip.  Right.  And he had all the latest features and safety things for his... 
[02:20:30]  Mirrors so he could see his kid in the back.  For his little Jackson.  Yeah.  No, we had a Volkswagen bus where we took the seats out.  So it was the driver's seat and the passenger seat.  You had those two for mom and dad.  Uh-huh.  But then there were supposed to be two rows of seats in the back.  Those were taken out so we could fit more people in there.  More people?  Is that what it was for?  Yeah.  Dude, we had seven kids.  Wow.  And they would just load you in and drive around.  Oh, yeah.  And if they had to hit the brakes hard, you'd all fly to the front. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, like the seatbelts were still kind of, if I remember correctly, were still anchored  to the floor of the damn thing.  So you kind of would hold on.  Oh, you'd hold on.  That's good in an accident.  Yeah, a little bit.  Rip your hands apart before you fly into the back of the seat.  So my dad would load up the Volkswagen bus, and all of a sudden we're out in the wilderness,  some wilderness on Long Island, and all of a sudden it would be a big hill.  He goes, hey, kids, why don't you run up that hill and get me some rocks?  What?  We thought we were going to play Army or something.  We tried to make it believe it was some kind of cool game. 
[02:21:30]  Make a game.  Guys, why don't you go play Army up in these woods?  But while you're at it, why don't you roll some of those nice rocks down?  Because we're going to be building another rock wall soon.  Oh, so you guys would have to go out and get the rocks for the rock wall?  Yes!  Oh, this is like prison, dude.  It's like a work detail.  Yeah.  Wow.  So we'd run around a little bit, but we'd be rolling the rocks down the hill and collecting  them and then go back to the homestead.  Isn't that odd now you go to posh stores and purchase rocks for your apartment? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, and when you were a kid, you were running up hills, getting rocks for rock walls.  So you just go, I'll take one of those, those.  Yeah, people see the little rock thing I have in my apartment and I'm like, don't even ask.  It's kind of a tribute.  It's kind of a reminder.  That's right.  Constant reminder of where you were, where you are.  I bought those rocks.  Yeah.  I didn't have to go out and dig for them.  Yeah, sometimes I had to dig for them.  Wow, that Gucci shoe really pissed him off.  I could absolutely see why now. 
[02:22:30]  I was wondering, when he put the shoe up there, I looked at Opie's face and there was just  this look of anger and you son of a bitch, you know, before you lobbed that chocolate  covered strawberry at it.  All the success was wiped away.  All the adult, he was just a little girl running through the woods and holding a lamb.  Holding a lamb.  Poor bastard.  No, it was, honestly, it was, I didn't know any better.  It puts the rocks in the, it puts the rocks in the minivan. 
[02:23:00]  I stink.  I mean, you know, we had a good, no, we had a good childhood though.  Cause we didn't know any better.  The only time I knew better was, like I said, going to school and seeing like the rich kids  with all the really nice clothes and, and, uh, and the cars.  But how was it around Christmas time in elementary school?  Cause I knew I didn't, I was by no means well off our Christmas.  Yeah.  You know, I, I would love to have some tragic story. 
[02:23:30]  It was, it was probably, probably, uh, better than most people's, uh, Christmas.  So maybe you got a new shovel.  No, they, no, they went all out.  A new cement rake.  They went all out for Christmas.  It was amazing.  Every year.  Absolutely amazing.  Couldn't even walk in the living room.  There were so many presents for us.  Oh yeah.  No, they went all out.  They credit cards.  I mean, to the limit, man.  Oh really?  Every year.  Oh yeah.  No, no, no, no.  No, they did their best.  That's good then.  I mean, seven kids and then all the other people they were taking in all the time.  So I don't know. 
[02:24:00]  You know, I, I, I had like some kind of half sister for a while and then one day she just  left.  I haven't seen her in 20 years.  I don't know.  She was living in the, uh, in your house.  Yeah, she was living in the house.  She was my sister's like best friend at the time that they brought in cause she was having  a bad, uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, home life.  Was there any resentment on your part?  Like, you know, excuse me, um, taking my lunch to, uh, to school in a cement bag, uh, bruised  apple, peppered farm bread.  Perhaps if you didn't take this person in, you could maybe get me some wonder bread, anything 
[02:24:30]  like that going through your head at any time?  Nah, not really.  No?  Honestly, not really.  Cause I was doing, I, I always, you know, did my own thing.  I was caddying and, you know, making my own money at 14.  Winning that caddy tournament.  Now that's the important thing.  Okay, Pookie, get me the peppered farm bread.  We had the, we had black kids that came out for the weekend.  How about a bruised apple?  We had the black kids come out for the weekend and we'd, what?  We'd take them to the beach and to like the, you, you were a, a sponsor family for, 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, I think so.  What was that called?  The Fresh Air Fund.  Something like that, yeah.  Yeah, there was a Fresh Air Fund.  I remember the commercial.  Yeah.  And it was the kid going, uh, uh, being taken out to the country, which was Long Island.  Yeah.  And going to the beach.  Either the beach.  With a wife family.  Or like the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the church pool or whatever it  was called.  No, it was Camp Alvernia.  Remember Camp Alvernia?  Oh, yeah.  I think the church would like, uh, take over that, the campgrounds for, I don't know, a weekend  or something like that. 
[02:25:30]  Invite the black kids?  Yeah, and all the, uh, all the families would bring their little black kids to the pool.  All the white families would bring their black kids, like, look what I got.  Oh, man.  That is horrible.  Yeah, well, I forgot about that.  A bunch of white people from Long Island.  And honestly, then, then you, you felt, then you felt like, you know, you had, you had it  good.  Cause it, cause it, you, you, you take things for granted.  Like.  Having a little fun, sending back to the Bronx.  Living on Long Island, we have some unbelievable beaches, as you know, you know, and, and we  would be bringing these black, you know, the black kids there and a bunch of families 
[02:26:00]  would get together and the black kids would be running around and, and, uh, and they would  just be out of their minds.  Cause they're not used to this.  You know, if they're lucky, they get to swim in one of these city pools, that's about  it.  That's it.  And then you realize, well, I guess it's not that bad out here, you know?  That's probably why they did it.  So.  They get you, wow.  That is something.  We got some audio, I think, of, uh, way long ago, uh, one of the black children, um, living  at, uh, at your house. 
[02:26:30]  Day is never finished.  Master got me working.  Someday master set me free.  Wow.  Sounded like they were having fun.  You didn't take in the black kids?  No.  My mother, she had to raise the three of us by herself.  You know, she did very well, but, you know, we weren't bringing in black kids and especially,  you know, oh, my, my mom is definitely mellowed, uh, with her age, believe it or not.  You've, you've heard her, her singing and whatnot, but I mean, her, her opinions, I guess, were 
[02:27:00]  a little different back then.  No, we weren't taking in any black children when, you know, when we'd leave our clothes around  and she'd come in, what the fuck am I?  Three shades darker than you picked this shit up, you know?  Like, oh.  Or, or, or, or I'd get, I'd get, uh, money for my birthday and I'd be like, mom, could  you take me to the mall?  I want to, look at you, you're spending that, what are you, nigger rich?  Save your money.  Do something.  I'm like, oh, okay.  And it was just, you know, that's the way my mother talked back then.  Well, yeah.  She's definitely changed, you know, her, her opinions, but back then, uh, that's kind 
[02:27:30]  of the language that was going around the house a little bit, so we weren't taking in  any, uh, any black children, weren't as charitable as, uh, the Hughes household.  I do remember the, the Press Air Fund, though.  We were brought up in a very religious, uh, not, not a religious household per se, but a  religious, uh, town, you know, Centerport is, uh, very Catholic and, uh, the church is  very involved in the community and stuff like that, so, you know, growing up, we got involved  with all this stuff, you know? 
[02:28:00]  God, no.  It was just, it was just all about us.  Believe me.  If, if it was, uh, you know, taking a black kid in from the Bronx so we could show them  a good time for the summer or us having name brand food or the store brand food, we go  for the name brand food.  I had the Wonder Bread, my friend.  Did you really?  Yeah.  I'm going to be the Wonder Bread.  I had the, the new lunchbox.  I had, I, I, I, I got to call my brother because he'll remember it.  I remember all the products that we had.  It was ridiculous.  And we had, if you open up our cupboard, it was just a lot of white. 
[02:28:30]  Was it all the, remember there was like, uh.  No frills, it was called.  It was called no frills.  No frills.  The white can with just.  Everything was, yeah, everything was white.  Yeah.  So when, when I saw that movie Repo Man and, you know, they went into the store and it  was just beer.  Yeah.  It used to make me laugh because I, I had that.  Not the beer part, but I mean, it was like, uh, yeah, like you said, peaches, uh, uh,  Corn Flakes.  Yeah.  But it wasn't even Corn Flakes.  It was like Flakes.  Flakes or something like that.  Flakes.  But everything was in white boxes.  Yep. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  That was the no frills brand.  And then, uh, no, we had.  Powdered milk?  No.  Dude.  Watered down powdered milk?  Nope.  That's what we had.  We had the milk.  We had Del Monte.  To this.  We had Entenmann's Donuts.  You know, I'm talking.  Wow.  I'm talking living large.  Living large.  And, and, you know, that was all my mom going to, going to work, you know, for 20 hours  a day.  Yeah.  But you had a lot less kids.  We had seven.  We only had the three of them.  We had seven kids plus, you know, excuse me, we would be bringing our friends over. 
[02:29:30]  I mean, my mom was feeding like, I don't know, man, 10, 12 people at a time easily.  Can't be so charitable.  Easily.  I was thinking about me, me, me.  That's what you got to do.  Water down orange juice.  To this day, I got to water down my orange juice.  If you see me in a restaurant, you'll laugh.  Yeah.  You've seen me water down the orange juice.  It's too sweet.  Yeah.  I'm used to.  You're used to watering down everything?  Yeah.  The worst was the powdered milk watered down.  Water, powder.  Stop it.  Where are you living?  You know, like that stuff we throw in our coffee sometimes? 
[02:30:00]  Like Coffee Mate.  Yeah, that's pretty much.  Water and Coffee Mate put on your cereal?  Pretty much.  I mean, it was actually powdered milk, so it was a little better, but.  Whoa.  Oh, yeah.  So maybe that came out yesterday.  I don't know.  Yeah, a little bit of that.  I was wondering, because I wasn't brought up with the best of everything.  You know, my mother was always struggling, so us three kids had what we wanted and stuff.  But I guess I was never at the position where I would then look at somebody with $500 Gucci  shoes and feel compelled to throw some chocolate-covered fruit at them. 
[02:30:30]  So, yeah, maybe I have a little more of an understanding now, Opie, of your anger.  Great.  Sean from Tennessee.  Grew up just like Opie.  Yeah, but you're in Tennessee.  You're in Tennessee.  Oh, that's horrible.  I wish I lived in Tennessee how he lived.  I would have fit right in.  This is New York.  Opie, you will let me know if that apple stops rolling.  My mother did pretty good, though.  She used to work at that disco out on Long Island. 
[02:31:00]  It's called Chaz.  You know what you have to do to do pretty well in a disco?  What?  You know how bad that just sounded?  No, no.  I'm going to say, my mother was like really hot.  And she used to dress like in the little skirts, because she was a cocktail waitress over at  a disco.  And the tips she used to get were ridiculous.  All these old guys would come in, you know, ogle her, she'd bring them the drinks, and  they would tip the crap out of her.  Your mom's still hot, by the way.  Well, you know, she's no kid anymore, but she's cute as a button. 
[02:31:30]  She's still a looker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I love my mom.  You all right, Hawk?  Spreading dysentery.  I know.  Your mom is very attractive.  She used to do very well, and she'd come home and be able to support us and take care  of three kids and do a pretty good job at it.  Cool.  Let's go to Jason.  Jason.  Yo, man.  What's up, you bastards?  What's up?  Yo, you remember a rumor when you were a kid about the parkway bridges being too small? 
[02:32:00]  Want to a parkway, Southern State, by Robert Moses, so the buses couldn't get through with  the black people to the beaches.  That was the rumor, that Robert Moses had the highways built on Long Island going to  his beaches, and the bridges are very low.  Trucks aren't allowed on these parkways.  A lot of people say that this isn't a rumor, by the way.  I know.  And the clearance under some of these bridges are as low as nine feet, some of them.  Really low bridges.  And the story is that Robert Moses did this on purpose, so the buses that brought the 
[02:32:30]  black people couldn't fit under the bridges, so they couldn't go to their beautiful, white,  pristine Long Island beaches.  But you go to some, you go to like some of the beaches that the black people are at Coney  Island and stuff?  Forget about it.  Yeah.  It was crazy.  All right, we got to take a break, but how did this start?  Oh, because we were saying goodbye to Noah.  Oh, and his Gucci shoes.  And I, you know, I liked the kid.  He was all right.  We had a lot of fun with him.  He gave us great radio.  We, uh, we did. 
[02:33:00]  I didn't mind his song, Julia.  You didn't mind it at all?  I remember that, yeah.  I thought it was a little much, but, uh, you know, you can't fault a guy for wanting  to pursue his dreams.  Yeah.  And he always backed up his girl stories.  He always had the right names in the right location.  He certainly did.  Never tripped up once.  Nope.  So, uh, whatever his sexual orientation is, uh, best of luck to you.  We'll never know.  And as far as, uh, the job around here, um, quite frankly, I'm not qualified to even comment 
[02:33:30]  on it, because I don't know what any of these assholes do.  I see him sitting there every day across from me through that window in the booth,  and I don't have a clue what any of them do.  I know the one, uh, plays music every so often, and we enjoy, uh, his selections, whatever  his name is, but...  That's Derek.  What?  Who?  I know Derek.  I just don't know the tall guy's name.  I number them.  It helps.  He's the one who sits is one.  One.  The tall one is two.  Two.  And the other one's interchange is three and four. 
[02:34:00]  I never know which is three and four, actually.  So I guess we're looking for a, uh, Noah three.  And I, you know, so I don't know what Noah did, and I don't know if he did it well.  I assume he did.  He was good.  He was here, and he wasn't fired, so I guess he, uh, he did, uh, the job.  Um, and he'll be, he'll be missed around here.  But I want to keep the door open.  If he wants to come back, we'll try to work something out for him.  All right?  We're always willing to work with people.  Because, quite frankly, we're saying goodbye to too many people on this show.  Yes. 
[02:34:30]  We, uh...  We're playing this Hulk music a little too much lately.  Yeah, I have noticed this music play a lot.  Who forgot?  We already forgot about cricket.  Ah, cricket.  Now we have to say goodbye to Noah Anthony.  So why don't you give the official goodbye to Noah?  Noah, bon voyage.  Uh, we wish you the best, and, uh, you'll be missed around here.  Take care.  Farewell.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  E-Rock, we've come a long way. 
[02:35:00]  We've listened to a lot.  This isn't the end of the program, but this ends the saga of Noah the Intern 2.  Well, Sam, you know, maybe had he finished out his internship, maybe kept in contact with  the show or even the company, who knows how his future would have turned out.  The Sirius XM.  Hits one.  Weekend Countdown.  And now we are ready for this week's top tune at an unprecedented event for the first  time ever on the countdown. 
[02:35:30]  A song debuts at number one.  Originally from Philly, now hobnobbing with the Goobah Smoochers in L.A.  Noah Ross with Julia on the Sirius XM Hits one.  Weekend Countdown.  Julia!  Julia!  Julia!  You're uncontrollable!  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Sam, in studio we have, I guess you could call him a legendary drummer from Guns N' Roses, 
[02:36:00]  Stephen Adler.  Yeah, Stephen Adler, fresh out of celebrity rehab and sober house and whatever else he was  on at the time, Stephen Adler comes in.  The man who was made famous for Guns N' Roses and then became famous for reality TV.  He's a little trippy.  I mean, but you don't know.  Either he's high or his mind has been affected from years and years of drug and alcohol abuse.  He's in studio, he's promoting his new project, Adler's Appetite, and even more importantly,  in studio to meet Stephen Adler, the Ron and Fez all-star producer, Eastside Dave. 
[02:36:30]  Dave's also on another show, isn't he?  It's called Special Delivery starring Sam and Dave.  Okay.  It's on this channel Saturday nights at 9pm.  But, Dave is a giant Guns N' Roses fan and he's a giant fan of making a spectacle of  himself.  That's true.  He comes in and he does that little thing where he just stares at a guest if he's really  excited and then he goes, and his voice gets really high.  Well, I don't want to give anything away, but let's just say, yes, what E-Rock said. 
[02:37:00]  Does he make a complete ass of himself in front of Stephen Adler?  Yeah.  Does Stephen Adler join in?  A little.  I can't wait.  I already told you about it, though.  I'm going to play it right now.  All right.  Here it is.  Nothing fun, nothing happy.  You're listening.  Nothing happy, nothing fun.  Welcome to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Nothing fun, nothing happy.  Or the virus.  Nothing happy, nothing fun.  Sirius XM.  Adler here?  Cool.  Hey, there they are.  Come on.  Come on in.  Hell yeah.  Pop right on in. 
[02:37:30]  You're not Stephen Adler.  You're not Stephen Adler.  Oh, here's Stephen Adler.  Holy shit.  Stephen!  What's happening?  What's up, Stephen?  How are you?  Find some seats.  Your name's Opium?  Opium, yeah.  You want some?  No.  You've had, uh, don't.  What's up, man?  How are you, bro?  How are you, Jim?  Hi, Jim.  Sit down, Stephen.  Thank you.  Oh, this is in my cock right over there.  Yeah, you just moved that up.  Yeah, the microphone.  Lift that up a little bit.  Cock high. 
[02:38:00]  Anthony, how are you?  How you doing, man?  Good.  How's life, man?  Excellent.  Excellent.  I'm here with Chip's enough.  Hey, Chip.  Yeah, you guys got a new project going on, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  It's called Adler's Appetite.  Yeah.  And just playing around, you know, the East, actually.  Wait.  Chip, explain.  He can do it.  He can do it.  He can do it.  Explain.  He's frazzled because we just did Stern.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, we're on tour right now.  We're doing a 20-city tour, and we're playing nothing but Appetite for Destruction, all 
[02:38:30]  the songs that Stephen wrote and played on.  Yeah.  And we're going to do a record, but right now we're just acquainting ourselves with  the North American audience before we get ready to go to Europe.  You know, because of all the shit that I've been through in my life, and I'm basically  back to, as Slash said to me, sometimes you've got to pay your dues twice in life.  Yeah, yeah.  So I'm paying my dues again, and it's all right.  You know, it's not as bad or as hard the first time around.  Right.  I got Slash back in my life.  So you're doing the old Guns N' Roses tunes?  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  All the stuff that I wrote and recorded with.  Are you going to actually do it authentically and make the audience wait like three, four  hours before?  No.  No, of course not.  This is a rock show.  I thought it would be kind of like really, you know, retro to kind of make the audience  really feel like the old days.  No, that's not a real good.  It's not a train wreck.  It's a rock show.  No, it's no different than what Axl's doing.  He's got, not to be disrespectful, but he's got like six or seven guys in the band,  and they're not even doing those songs.  And Steven, he's one of the original guys too, and he's got me playing with him.  I got 17 records with my band. 
[02:39:30]  Right.  So he's got some veterans.  We've got Michael Thomas from Faster Pussycat.  Oh, wow.  And one of the guys from Quiet Riot, Alex.  Alex Rossi.  So we've got a good gang.  Yeah.  And the band sounds great every night.  It's jam-packed.  There's tons of trim at the show.  It's over the top, you guys.  It's going really well.  Well, that's good.  Still good.  The girls, I mean, not getting a little to the upper line of hotness.  It's a mix, because the mothers and fathers that dug us, they're bringing their kids.  They're 21 years old, and I have a 22-year-old daughter myself. 
[02:40:00]  I have 20-year-olds, 18, 19, 20-year-olds come up to me and say,  oh, my mom fucked you back in the day.  Oh, great.  Now what about you?  It never works.  That's fantastic.  Now what about you?  Yeah.  The apple doesn't fall apart from the tree.  The girls that do come on the bus, I just play the director.  Yeah.  Oh, you guys go over here.  You put your punk over here.  You put your punk over here.  You suck on this guy.  I learned from Steven Tyler.  Just videotaping.  I learned from the best.  You learned from the best.  So are you staying sober?  Are you doing all right?  Yeah, I'm doing really good. 
[02:40:30]  You know what?  There's no heroin.  There's no crack in my life.  I take a hit of weed now and then.  So no, you're not staying sober.  No, I'm not 100%.  Well, no, because he has a license to smoke pot.  It's in Proposition 215 in California, so if you live out there, you can get a little  license, and then you can go to any of the doctor's offices and get as much cuckoo as  you want.  Yeah, that's pretty sweet.  But I'm not the stoner.  Are you smoking it for medical reasons there, Steven?  What's that?  You're smoking the pot for the medical reasons? 
[02:41:00]  Of course.  Yeah?  I have brain damage.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got the, uh.  I have a lot of mental illnesses.  I can't sleep at night.  I get headaches.  That's the excuse you have to tell him.  So the weed.  I'm sure the weed.  I can't sleep.  At least he's being honest.  At least he's being honest.  I can't sleep.  I get headaches.  Dude, that sober house.  Holy shit.  Yeah, it was a great experience.  Those two, uh.  Somebody getting me arrested part.  Well, the first two episodes in that, that, uh, do-gooder got you arrested, right?  Who ran the house, who looks like she wants drugs more than anybody in that house.  That bitch had no right being on that show, being a part of that. 
[02:41:30]  Not just the show, being a part of what her job was to be.  She was not capable of doing that job.  And I told him before we even started that.  That's the wrong person.  But, you know, it's over.  I got arrested.  I'm still paying for it.  Yeah.  Um.  I mean, that was.  I'm still a hater.  You couldn't figure.  But seeing myself on TV, on film, fucked up like that.  Yeah.  Really helped me.  Yeah.  Because it made me see how.  I was like, who's that person? 
[02:42:00]  God, that person's fucked up.  Right.  And then he gets closer, and it's me.  Yeah, that whole scene of you trying to find where your room was to get more of her own  was unbelievable.  Yeah.  You couldn't even figure out that your room was upstairs.  I couldn't even open the door.  You were looking at a doorknob going, what the fuck is this, and what does it do?  I couldn't.  I couldn't.  It was, yeah, it was fucked up.  It was some amazing TV to watch.  Yeah.  It's got to be harder, too, when you have a limitless supply, or what seems like a limitless  supply of money.  Because, you know, part of the problem with getting high and drinking is where you're going  to get your fucking money.  And then, I know you went through a legal thing with Guns N' Roses. 
[02:42:30]  You got some money.  That was 20 years ago.  So you had it.  All I got from that lawsuit was my royalties back, which I had full rent of, which they  sneakily tried to take from me.  It was basically what they tried to do was, here's $2,000, and you get the fuck out of  here.  Cool.  It's like I never existed.  And they had me signing papers with the lawyer, who was still my lawyer, so it was conflict  of interest.  But, you know, I got my 20%. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two grand they wanted to buy off?  Two grand.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Here's $2,000.  Get the hell out of here.  I'm all...  What the fuck's going on?  I think the albums might have made a little more than that.  Oh, yeah.  It was already.  I think...  It was already at like $12 million or something.  Yeah, I think...  We're going $2,000.  I mean, I was fucked up, but I wasn't that fucked up.  Not that fucked up, right?  Not that fucked up.  Uh-uh.  Is it weird playing without them?  I mean, you've probably been doing it for a little while now, but is it kind of weird  being in another band and like, you know, just...  Did you look at different people as opposed to Axl and Slash? 
[02:43:30]  No, it's been too long.  And two years ago, in 2007, Slash and Duff and Izzy came down and played with me at the  Key Club in L.A.  And that went really great.  Axl, of course, didn't show up.  And actually, Slash wouldn't play that night because he was concerned about Axl being upset  with him playing with me.  So it was just Duff and Izzy actually played, but Slash came down.  He cares about Axl.  I care about Axl. 
[02:44:00]  You know, I had his back.  You know, if he ever wants that, you know, we were a band.  We were like a gang.  You know, I've started fights because of him, you know, to stick up for him.  You know, P.I.  He would redo a show.  First song, he'd throw the microphone in the middle of the song and leave the stage.  And then after the show, people from the show would come up and say, you're singing  with an asshole and fuck him and this.  And I'd punch him in the face.  Don't talk about my singing like that.  Fuck you.  But you guys, like, everyone asks about Reunion, and I know you don't know, but it's almost 
[02:44:30]  like Sabbath did it.  I mean, there was some fucking harsh words between Tony and Ozzy.  I mean, and they wound up pulling it back together.  It's best left of, I don't know.  What is Axl's problem?  What's the headline there?  You know what?  It's best left.  You guys are all scared of Axl.  I'm not scared of him.  I'm not scared of him, asshole.  Let me go to Chip.  I'm so tired of hearing about him.  I understand, but we did.  We had the opportunity.  We're such a big, successful band. 
[02:45:00]  We're still loved.  We still sell millions of records.  We have a great opportunity to go out and not just make ourselves happy, make the world  happy.  When I go on tour around the world, I have people from different countries, thousands of  people come up to me and say, the Appetite for Destruction is a soundtrack to my life.  That's like the nicest thing somebody could say to you.  I mean, I hope you had a good life.  I was a huge Guns N' Roses fan.  Appetite for Destruction, one of the greatest rock albums still to this day. 
[02:45:30]  But we get you guys in here individually and no one wants to talk about Axl.  They're like, hands off.  And we're just asking.  It's too much.  We're not even asking you to trash the guy or anything.  No, it's just ridiculous.  But it's like, oh man, I don't even want to go down that road.  Which means, wow, there's something there.  Chip, what do you got?  Rumor has it that Live Nations wants to pay Guns N' Roses.  And this is right from one of the heavyweights down there that smokes cigars all day in the  office.  So it's got to be cigs. 
[02:46:00]  So it's true, yeah.  $150 million for Guns N' Roses, 22 shows.  That's it.  See, and now any sane person, even if you donate the money, you do it.  You do it for the fans.  You do it for the fans.  And you do it.  Nobody gets that kind of money.  And what?  It has to be the original lineup?  It has to be the original lineup.  Yeah.  No second fiddles.  If it's not the original thing, it's what Axl's doing now.  Right.  Oh, they all want to do it.  Yeah.  Except for Axl. 
[02:46:30]  Why don't you think Slash wants in?  Because the last time I talked to him.  I'm positive Slash would do it.  I'm sure they would.  Slash doesn't hate Axl.  Axl just hates everybody.  In this economy?  Yeah.  Of course.  I'd go out with enough's enough for $20,000.  I like Chip.  He tells it like it is, Stephen.  Come on.  Oh, we're brothers.  This guy, he's not scared of anything.  I'm not, no.  I'm not sure he doesn't get that same question a hundred times.  A hundred times.  In a week.  I don't know what to say anymore about the guy. 
[02:47:00]  You had a stroke, man.  You look good.  I mean, did it affect your playing at all?  I mean, people want such a major catastrophe to happen to you, and you seem fine.  It was just a speech thing, and I've been working on that with a teacher.  Yeah.  Dr. Drew hooked me up with.  Oh, okay.  Dr. Sophie, I still work with.  So musically, it's done nothing, no damage.  I think he plays better now.  I mean, he's killing, yeah.  Well, not being fucked up, you know.  He's gained some weight.  He's strong.  I mean, he does the whole set every night with me, bro.  I haven't stopped touring at all.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  I've been playing for 25 years.  It's my whole life.  I've dedicated everything I've got to this.  The most pain, the most joy music has given me.  Playing with Stephen here, and these songs, they transcend.  I've had a couple hits with enough stuff I can be, not to sound unmodest, but Guns N' Roses,  every song was a smash hit.  Sure.  Every night we play, it's jam-packed.  People are going crazy.  There's a brink truck full of trim.  They know every single word to the songs.  Trim is such a great word.  You don't hear that.  That's a fucking great word, man.  I never say trim anymore.  It's the best.  Yeah.  And what about singing as far as, you know, because Axel does have a very distinctive 
[02:48:00]  voice.  Yeah, we've got a young guy named Sheldon Tarsha, who Chip actually found an ad that he put  out in L.A. Young fucking guy full of Piston Vinegar.  Yeah.  You know, he's excited to do it and appreciates and loves the music.  That's cool.  And the girls love him.  Wow.  He's got a big cock.  Is he packing a lot, really?  He's packing a lot.  That's important.  It's like one of those commemorative souvenir baseball.  The best to give him away at the beginning of the year. 
[02:48:30]  So he's got something going for him.  Who knows how long the run's going to be, you know?  There's not many guys that can sing the actual stuff.  He does a great job.  Yeah, yeah.  Because that's, you know, that's a tough singing style.  You blow your throat out pretty easily.  Back in a big cock, though.  I heard fucking Bruce Dickinson was fucking packing a mule, too, from Maiden.  Really?  Yes, I did.  He's got a great voice.  That's for sure.  I don't know about the mule part, though.  You got to get into the restroom with him.  I did show with him, but I never got that.  I don't see what Todd was packing. 
[02:49:00]  Is he really?  Oh, man.  Does he tie little fucking bandanas to it?  He could do that.  That happens to me a lot.  We had Tom Jones in here, and he went to the bathroom.  And what you hear about is Tom Jones' talk.  I really wanted to peek at Tom Jones' dick.  I just didn't have the moral fortitude to stick my dick in so much.  Oh, man.  You had to.  After all the stories you hear, I don't think it's gay.  I think you got to take a peek, right?  No, take a peek.  That's not gay at all.  Gotta look.  Gotta look.  Chip, were you the one with Madonna?  Yeah.  Is that a real story?  Yeah.  Look at him.  Yeah.  We've never done that. 
[02:49:30]  I don't know why you've never done our show before.  I wanted to come on the show, but we didn't have a publicist at the time.  That's all good.  But you urinated in Madonna's vagina.  That's how the story goes.  Yeah, I don't want to be disrespectful.  Look at Jimmy.  Listen, my grandpa used to always tell me, don't sling money if you live in a glass house.  That's his Axel story that he doesn't want to talk about all the time.  It's the pits and the vagina story.  Jesus Christ, a hundred times.  We cross paths and that's good.  Wow.  Yeah.  But you got her when she was, you know.  Oh, she was really pretty. 
[02:50:00]  That's one thing I will say.  Beautiful face.  She's a superstar, you know.  Let's face it.  I mean, I don't think her pipes, she's not really a great singer, but she's got great writers  around her, great killer songs.  She dances her ass off.  She knew how to market herself.  Yeah.  She's a star.  Did you see the picture that came out recently of her vagina?  No.  The big hairy bush that sold on.  That's not true.  She doesn't have a beard.  No, this is when she was like nobody and she made like $20 to like pose nude and then  the picture went for thousands and thousands of dollars recently.  Maybe Danny can find it. 
[02:50:30]  I remember seeing some.  Well, you know, back then in the late 70s, early 80s, it was.  The hairy bush.  Yeah.  It was it.  People were wearing ZZ top beards.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember we were playing out in Texas one time with some band and Danny goes,  come here, you got to see this.  And the girl pulled her dress up and it was a beard down there.  Yeah.  It was a ZZ top beard.  Yeah, that's for some guys that's a turn on.  You know, I question it, but the old style, whatever trips your trigger, it's the old  style.  Everyone shaves now.  And I think after a while, that's going to get a little passe. 
[02:51:00]  You better, you know, it's much cleaner that way.  It's much better.  You know, as long as you're not sweeping the dirt in the kitchen, you got a chance.  Look at that.  Look at that.  There it is.  That's real.  Wow.  That's real.  That's pretty right there.  Yeah, but that that's not real young.  I don't think I think she's right there.  Probably 20s in a mid 20s.  That is a hairy snatch.  Look at her underarms.  That's gotta be.  That's a lie.  There's no way she did that.  No, she did in penthouse too.  I think when she was in penthouse, her fucking hits for show.  With the hairy underarms too?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ish, come on.  Wait, Steven, get a mic.  You got to throw a couple of Tic Tacs in there. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  It's not good.  We got Steven Adler and Chip Boz enough in studio.  Steven, what were you saying?  I was saying that looks pretty much like every pussy I've seen from age 12 to 20.  Yeah, yeah.  It was like the early days.  You used to have to push that shit out of the way.  Man, it's like, where the fuck is it?  To me, it just seems doctored a little bit to me.  Nah, they said it's legit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, that's like a trainer.  I can't stop looking at it.  Yeah.  You like that?  You want to go old?  No.  You like that, Steven?  You want to go old school and get one of those? 
[02:52:00]  That'd be like kissing Castro after he had trout.  The lips look nice, though.  It looks like, if you could see, like, lips through that much.  There's no lips there.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, he's got a little bit of pink right in there.  Barely.  Right there.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  There it is.  It looks like she's a roast beef.  Yeah, nice phallus.  A little something going on there.  I think it's doctor, and she's much prettier than that.  Yeah.  Doctor.  Well, that's a story I would tell every day.  Wow.  How do you get sick and tell that story?  Yes!  I just, because I respect women.  I don't want to come off like a jagoff. 
[02:52:30]  I think you're, I don't think you've come across bragging.  With the likes of a Madonna, I think you've got to kind of, you know.  Yeah.  That's like fucking the Queen of England.  Yeah.  She got drunk, I fuck her.  I highly doubt it.  That's not a good analogy, okay?  The Queen of England?  Are you kidding me?  She's older than a moose pussy.  What the hell is that?  Is that a bird monkey?  It's some kind of a...  No, that's Danny.  Are you on drugs again?  Danny, how'd you do that?  I think he's got wings.  Yeah, there's some weird animal on TV right now. 
[02:53:00]  I love your tail, Danny.  Hey, Stephen, the one thing about, I think it was in the other show when you had the conversation  with your mom.  Oh, yeah.  Seems like you have a pretty intense relationship with your mom.  Did they take your money?  Dr. Drew and Dr. Sophie, they kind of brought everything back up.  They felt that I had anger issues with the way I grew up with my family, which I grew up  wonderfully.  I grew up with my grandparents, and they were the best things ever. 
[02:53:30]  They were the best parents you could have.  For one, they already had their kids, so I was running free.  But they were my parents.  It seems like your mom's holding some kind of grudge or something.  I have an older brother.  Right.  And my real father left before I was even born.  So she was by herself.  So when I was born, I left the hospital and lived with my grandparents until I was five. 
[02:54:00]  I moved back when I was five with my mom, and she remarried.  That's how I got the Adler name, because my real name was Coletti.  Coletti?  Yeah.  Nice.  And then my stepfather was Adler.  And I moved with him, and then when I, you know, I was rebellious and was running around  and wanted to be in a rock band and not go to school and, you know.  Did she think it was a stupid dream to want to be in rock bands and all that? 
[02:54:30]  No, I didn't.  Of course not.  Of course you didn't think it was stupid.  No.  And then, you know, it worked out for you.  Yeah.  And then, did they take your money when you were kind of like down and out?  Well, yeah, yeah.  It was very ugly with that whole money thing, with power of attorney.  But once I got it back, everything was back, you know, sort of normal.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, me and my mom, we'd get along and, you know, like Grandpa said, all wounds take  time to heal, you know. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  But they're healing.  And I have to say, Dr. Drew and Sophie and Bob Forrest have been a big help for me.  Yeah.  You don't regret doing the show, do you?  What's that?  You don't regret doing the show, don't you?  Hell no.  You know, even if they didn't pay me, I would have done it.  Gave you a lot of exposure, too.  Well, not the exposure.  It was a great experience.  The exposure couldn't mean crap if I didn't get anything out of it.  Well, you did, though.  Yeah.  People want to see it.  That's why I went in with that attitude.  Right, right.  See, they asked me to do the first season, but I wasn't ready. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I wasn't ready to try to stop partying, to give myself that chance.  A year later, just things worked out that way, and I just felt different.  Are you Jones in for the heroin?  No, I don't know.  I did hear, last time I did heroin, I was on that show.  No, he's really good.  Yeah, I'm not going to.  This is why Sugar Coley is Stephen Aylor, for Christ's sake.  Guns and roses, okay?  He's done more cocaine and heroin than Pablo Escobar and his whole team.  The guy's focused.  He's a smart cat. 
[02:56:00]  He's not a dum-dum.  And he did this show to straighten his life out.  As you guys look at him right here, he's not a fuck-up right there.  He's a winner right there.  Well, that's why, honestly, that's why I asked, because Sober House, they didn't really want  to focus on you as a smart guy.  They wanted to focus on you, like, trying to figure out where the fuck your room was  and what is a doorknob.  Yeah.  And I was expecting that guy to sort of walk in here, and I'm surprised, to be honest  with you.  You have it together way more than I thought you would.  I'm surprised, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're touring around in Oscar Minor and Wiener Wagons, playing six nights a week.  Yeah.  And it's back to clubs right now, guys. 
[02:56:30]  I'm not going to sugarcoat it.  But guess what?  There's room to grow.  And we're going to get together and probably do a record.  And it'll probably be a cover record first.  We'll get Slash on it, and we'll probably get Brian May and a bunch of cool guys to come  down.  Robin Zanner from Cheap Trick.  Right.  Milo from Steelheart.  We'll just get cool guys that we love to come down and sing on the songs.  And then we'll do a studio record after that, because you guys know I write, like, tons.  Yeah.  We're going to start working on, after this little tour we're doing, start working on 
[02:57:00]  a cover album, where we're going to, the songs that we pick out to do, we'll work on getting  Slash to produce it for starters.  Yeah.  And that's the most important I want, to do a project with him.  And actually, Slash is working on his own solo record right now.  He's over with Kid Rock.  He's doing a song with him.  And after this little run we're doing, I'm going to record a song with him, too.  You guys are old for the first time.  We've never met Axl, but you guys, we've met the rest of you guys.  And man, you guys are all down to earth.  Yeah, all of you. 
[02:57:30]  Wow.  It's all points bulletin now.  Where is Izzy?  It's a long time ago.  I don't know where he is.  That's many years ago, but you guys are all very down to earth.  Normal dudes.  And always keep him busy, it seems.  The busy part helps.  Yeah, not just sitting back.  Yeah, not sitting back.  Dude, I'd watch so much TV, the TV would be watching me.  Yeah.  They'd stop acting on TV.  Are they going to watch us or what?  When you're out of the band, when that happens, when you get pushed out of a band, are you 
[02:58:00]  watching them as they continue on?  Of course.  Just go, motherfucker, that should be me?  Or do you not?  Yeah, fucking it, of course.  You're watching everything they do, listening to every new record?  Yeah, it killed me.  I remember when that first song came out for that Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.  You could be mine.  You could be mine, right?  Yeah.  I was in a rehab.  I mean, it didn't last.  I mean, once I saw that on TV, the video, I was all, fucking assholes.  Lefty, me.  Put you over the edge there. 
[02:58:30]  It was because, for one, those were all, I'll use your illusion, it would have been bigger  than Appetite.  We wrote those songs, me, Sash, and Duff, and Izzy, and Axl wrote them, just like we  did the songs in Appetite.  And once they threw me out, and they threw Matt in, the whole feel changed.  You can hear it, I can hear it, not just out of spite, but right after the Civil War,  the song Civil War, it's a different band. 
[02:59:00]  All the keyboards, and all the vocals, and crap.  But if it was done the way that we did Appetite, it was supposed to be done.  Keep it just down and dirty, man.  Chemistry means something, though.  I mean, you can't just change one.  It means something like on a baseball team, sometimes you yank the third baseman, and  the fucking team is just not as good, because there's something missing that was there.  And Appetite, and G&I was such a big band because of the five people.  Right.  You know?  Wow.  It's not too many bands get...  I remember when you guys did that, use your illusion, Stephen, the guys had, 
[02:59:30]  they got the Metro in Chicago.  Joe Shannon's place, great room to play.  Everybody plays the radio, had all the big bands.  When they first start, they go to the Metro.  These guys were smart enough to lock it out for two months and just hone their chops and  do their homework and get all the songs together.  Use your illusion, bro.  All the songs already written.  He was on all the stuff, and then he got the ax because he was doing drugs like they were.  Yeah.  But because he was sick and couldn't get it together, he had a broken hand, they didn't want  to wait, so they had some other guy fill in, Fred Corey, and that was kind of pimp 
[03:00:00]  because if Slash broke his finger, you wouldn't call the guy from Love, Hate to come down  and play on it or something.  You know what I mean?  He started to work it out and get your guy to get healthy again and bring him back into  the fold.  The people are going to wait, especially if you've got appetite for destruction on the  heel.  They already came out and sold tons.  So you know the next one is going to come out and do something for sure.  It had to have been even bigger.  Because you broke your finger?  I fractured my finger that Fred Curry from Cinderella filled in and did four shows.  Wow.  Man, that was very hurtful. 
[03:00:30]  That was pretty much the beginning of the whole rocky slide.  Yeah, no shit.  If it's any consolation, though, Kiss just did do a show without Paul Stanley.  He had to go to the fucking hospital and Gene just sang all of his songs.  Really?  Guys, guess what?  Kiss will be back together again.  Mark my words, the original guys, all of them, okay?  Really?  Yeah, for sure.  I'm not going to say anymore because my manager will get pissed, but I see real soon you'll  see the original gang back together because that's what everybody wants.  They want to see the guys that made in hell happen.  Yeah, that I think would be one of those tours where because of Kiss, there's so many bands 
[03:01:00]  that spawned from there.  What, do they give Gene Simmons electric shock?  No.  To make him understand?  No, Cash.  Oh, probably Cash.  I don't see them doing that.  Jesus, Gene.  We get it.  There's other guys in the band, though.  I heard something about that Kiss, that Gene is going to have a band in Asia, a band in  Europe.  Franchise.  Yeah.  And they'll be all playing at the same time.  Like McDonald's.  Only with a band.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You franchise it out.  So I doubt that they'll ever get back together like that. 
[03:01:30]  Well, who do you think is the holdout?  If you think they're going to be back, who's...  Because Gene and Paul, I think, would do it.  Didn't they boot Peter and Ace back out?  Or didn't they leave voluntarily?  Yeah.  Gene said the car's designed with a front seat and a back seat.  Him and Paul sit in the front.  But at this point right now, when you have a band that's that powerful and sold that  many records, and you're getting older, right?  Right.  I mean, he's doing TV shows now, for Christ's sake.  Of course, he's going to go back out.  There's going to be a $100 million deal.  You're going to get the little kitty cat whiskers back on.  You've got to have Ace, because he's a superstar. 
[03:02:00]  He's like the coolest guy in the band.  They're all great.  That's what Jimmy says all the time.  Ace is the cool guy.  He's the street guy.  He did drugs.  He boned all kinds of models and actresses.  He lives a rock and roll lifestyle, where Gene and Paul, those guys are milk and cookies.  Real smart business guys, but they don't do anything.  Not even smoke.  Nothing.  Yeah.  They're real straight.  And that's probably why the run has been so long, because they've kept it together.  I admire them for that, because I couldn't do it.  The fucking Tom Snyder interview.  If I was in Kiss, I'd be in the backstage areas of smoking like a chimney before we go 
[03:02:30]  on, because those songs are so easy to play anyway, you know?  They're basic, right?  Yeah, simple.  Yeah.  Gene is a verbal quailude.  Hey, simple rocks to best rocks.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Right on.  I don't want to hear from Gene.  God, he just sits down and just goes off about, you know, his products and this and  that.  All right, Gene.  We get it.  You made a fortune with Kiss.  Talk about something.  He's always got to be on.  The bragger.  There's no honesty with Gene. 
[03:03:00]  Right.  Yeah, just bragging about it.  What did you guys...  Oh, sorry.  My new Kiss submarine that I'm putting out now for people that want to see Kiss underwater.  Really, Gene?  It's fantastic.  It's very good.  It's great, Gene.  I don't believe that.  Break it into the underwater market with Kiss.  Yes, yes.  That's something he would look into.  I believe this.  I believe you.  Jesus Christ.  So are you enjoying at least the trim afterwards?  Are you at least partaking?  I've always loved the trim.  I have nothing, but I've always admired trim. 
[03:03:30]  It's just got to be...  If there's no trim in the audience, it's a drag of a gig.  Trust me.  Who wants to play for all the sausages?  Sausage Fest, yeah.  Guns N' Roses has both.  You know, the dudes always love their...  The dudes are more loyal, okay?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When the next cute band comes through town, the trimmer's going to be there, okay?  For the Fall Out Boys and, you know, All-American Rejects, whoever that's out there  playing.  But for Steven and his Guns N' Roses stuff, I mean, people love that.  And there's a lot of dudes and a lot of trim, both.  Steven likes seeing the sausage in the audience, though.  Oh, yeah.  I'm fine with that, too. 
[03:04:00]  But there's so many girls.  All I know, I see...  I get so distracted playing because I got all these girls blowing kisses at me and talking  to me and, you know...  You're still with your girl from Silver House?  Yeah, I got my wife, Carol, and of course.  Yeah, she's great.  No, I don't fuck the girls.  I just play theater.  Some of them should have given up the spandex, though, a few years back, right?  Yeah.  See a couple of them.  Yeah, I've seen it.  Just all looking.  It's a whole new generation now. 
[03:04:30]  They don't really see too many people with spandex anymore.  No.  I was a picture at some of these shows where, you know, the girls would come out and think  they're going to dress like they did back in the day.  It's not going to work.  No.  No.  No.  You see every little dimple and pucker on the spandex ass.  Wow.  Well, it was a pleasure meeting you, Steven.  You guys, too, man.  And Chip.  I don't either.  Best of luck on the road.  Hey, who's the Jagoff?  I've got a bad rap on me.  I see your screen.  Which one? 
[03:05:00]  Where's wrapping you?  No, I just see the little things and it's hard to believe.  You can see that.  You think you're doing a good job and you're being honest and giving a good interview and  then you've got one little snaggle-toothed Jagoff right there.  Compare me to Penn Jillette.  You can't even.  Score in Penn Jillette.  Are you kidding me?  You can't even read this shit.  Wow, you can read this?  Oh, yeah.  You've got like 2015 vision.  I'm a lot closer than I had to like squirt this shit.  I have good eyes because I smoke a lot of pot.  Remember glaucoma?  You want me to read this?  No, please don't. 
[03:05:30]  All right, don't read it.  Thank you.  All right.  Wow.  You're always going to have one or two.  What's the name on there?  Always.  The name next to it.  Is there any name there?  Douchebag.  Pat?  Yeah, Pat.  Douchebag snaggle-toothed.  Pat, you little pussy.  Meet me outside, okay?  Well, he's in Hackettstown.  Yeah, I hope he comes out to a show because I'll pull his hair out like a Barbie doll.  It does get to you, though, right?  The criticism is fucking the truth.  It's fine, the criticism, but nah, come on, you guys.  I don't deserve that from this jag-off. 
[03:06:00]  I'm one of the nicest rock and rollers out there.  I have a number of respect for people.  I'm grateful for the opportunities that I've had.  Yeah.  I got a lot of records.  I'm a veteran just like these other jag-offs, okay?  I'm no different.  It's a constant barrage of assholes.  And I don't have Carol Kay as a publicist helping me or something.  I wouldn't have to say nothing, you know?  It's me against the world.  Right.  Us against the world.  You're always going to get those fucking assholes.  You've been around long enough.  You shouldn't let the one or two.  I just seen it right there, and I was just upset.  I'm sorry.  Assholes.  I can't stand that shit. 
[03:06:30]  Enjoying the appearance.  You don't have to hail me.  That's fine.  I'm fine with that.  No, but I'm just saying.  I mean, but it's always the one that'll bother you when you know that.  I unload on him on the air.  I unload.  Do you?  Yeah, I told some fucking douchebag that I was going to come over and fuck his mother  in the ass when he was saying something about, I think that in one picture, I looked like  I had a gut.  Yeah.  Something as innocent as that.  You're thin.  I'm not a thin guy.  I was blowing my nose.  I was sick.  I liked the flu and shit, and Opie snapped a picture of me, and it ends up on the website, 
[03:07:00]  and then it's like, oh my God, Anthony, you look like shit, you're fat.  I was like, you know something?  Go fuck your mother.  I'll come over.  Take, think of your innocent mom's face.  Just think of it.  Think, now my cock ramming in her fucking mouth.  And it was like, I think it upset the gentleman, which is good.  It's always weird.  Because every so often you've got to unload on these motherfuckers.  It's always weird when guys comment about what you look like, though.  It's like, are you guys? 
[03:07:30]  Why do you care what I look like?  I don't think I've ever commented on, you know, I don't find you attractive, sir.  There's a lot of mental issues out there.  Well, it's the closet pillow-biter, okay?  Yep.  Because they kind of, I'm like, you know the chick?  What are you doing?  Yeah.  I don't get it.  Jesus.  It's weird.  Assholes.  A little weird.  Fuck Pat.  Fuck Pat.  Fuck Pat's mom.  Yeah.  Your mother Pat.  You sound like David Lee Rothman from the 80s.  Let me go to Anthony in Jersey. 
[03:08:00]  Maybe Pat will call the show.  Anthony, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Steve, I'm a huge fan, man, from the Appetite days.  I just, I heard a rumor.  I know it's probably circled around before.  That, uh, at the end of Rocket Queen, there's the woman moaning.  Yeah, what about her?  Yeah, rumor has it that that was your girlfriend with Axl in the studio.  Well, yeah.  It was Axl fucking one of the stripper girlfriends I had.  I had numerous amounts of them.  There was a lot of band days that were strippers that hung out with the band. 
[03:08:30]  And then she was just one that, one of a few that I was with.  And she just happened to be, she was just a cool chick.  And then, I don't know, I wasn't upset by it.  It wasn't my wife, you know.  I was upset by it.  I was about 20 years old.  It was some stripper chick, you know.  No big deal.  Nice.  I wasn't the only one fucking her.  Apparently.  You didn't get possessed of or jealous?  Of course not.  It was a rock band. 
[03:09:00]  There's no tears on a fucking tour bus.  There'd be no tears on a bus on the road.  No tears like that.  What's the only rules?  Like if a guy really likes a chick, then you don't bang her?  Well, it's disrespectful if you really care about a chick for somebody in your band, in your gang,  that you're supposed to be so tight with.  Like what happened with that Poison guy who was playing with, took Cece's place?  Yeah, Richie Kotzen.  Yeah, that kind of sucker was fucking that.  Ricky's chick.  Ricky's chick.  Is that why he left the band? 
[03:09:30]  Hey, Ricky, they threw him.  Listen, they pulled the bus over on the side of the road and they said, get off.  Like in Mississippi or somewhere.  They said, just get out.  Yeah, they pulled over and said, get out of the bus right now.  And they threw him out.  You know, they just did the Bret Michaels, whatever, true Hollywood story, whatever the  fuck they call him these days.  And they don't mention that part of the story.  I just watched the Bret Michaels story over the weekend.  But they don't want to give that guy satisfaction.  So the guy replaces Cece and this guy's now fucking Ricky's girlfriend, is that?  Well, yeah.  He was.  Ricky's got a wife.  Ricky's got a beautiful wife. 
[03:10:00]  That was a long time ago.  That was a long time ago.  Behind his back?  Yeah.  He gets an opportunity of a lifetime like this.  Listen, and it was going on.  This was like 93, 94.  And you could have any chick on the road?  Any chick he wanted.  And Poison only done one tour over in Europe.  Yeah, I'm playing the chick too, though.  And we were, Enough's Enough was a support act for Poison during that time.  And I remember when we were playing in Glasgow, Scotland, there was three, four hundred people  at the hotel wanting to meet Poison.  Right.  And Richie Kotzen walked through like he was Jimmy Page.  Real snaggletooth Jagoff.  I went right to Bret.  I go, hey, bro, you better get your boy in check because these fans are here to see 
[03:10:30]  you and they love the band.  You guys have always shown that back to the fans.  And now you got this Jagoff walking through like he plays in Captain Beyond.  So you got to try to nip it in the bud.  And he got fired like, you know, three weeks later.  Wow.  I don't want to say I got him fired, but I just don't like bad behavior.  When you're a gang in a rock band, you got to do stuff together.  You can't be nailing a guy's chicks and stuff.  It's going to shorten the run.  You can't be sneaky like that shit.  Yeah, just turn the other cheek and don't even look at her.  Whatever happened to that guy?  Your partners.  Yeah, see?  He's not doing anything. 
[03:11:00]  But have you heard what he's up to?  Is he like selling cars?  What is he doing?  I don't think he's selling cars.  He's a good guitar player, to be honest with you.  But I don't think he's doing anything.  He's playing somewhere.  Yeah, he's playing somewhere.  He had a nice opportunity.  He might be one of those cover bands that, you know, does like a...  Journey cover band?  Journey or something, yeah.  There's a lot of them out there.  I can't play Neil Sean.  No way.  Yeah, he's not doing Neil Sean.  No, he's not doing Neil Sean.  What do you think of those bands?  Sean is too great.  The main players are gone and the band goes on and hope the fans are going to buy into it.  The Journey is a huge example. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, well, they got the singer from...  It sounds exactly like Steve Harvey, but it's not Journey that we know from growing up.  No, but you're not going to get Steve Perry back because, first of all, he's got no pipes  anymore, okay?  No, I don't believe that.  No, he can't.  I don't believe he does.  I know he could still sing.  See, when we were young and we were writing all these records, Don used to complain all  the time because you're writing them with too high of a key.  Right.  When you're 20 years old, you can write them and sing your ass off, but when you get to  be 35, 40, it gets real...  And you don't want to change the key on the song.  You don't fail.  Say, what was in B?  We're going to do it and let's do it in A now. 
[03:12:00]  Go down a full step.  Because the song doesn't sound the same.  People notice.  It sounds like the cover band then, you know, not the real McCoy.  Yeah.  How about fucking like Robert Plant?  Like listening to...  When you listen to Robert Plant now...  I know.  Plant, I don't think, was ever a good live.  I don't think it was ever a good live.  Sorry.  His vocals, he never was able to recreate what they did in the studio live.  No, the studio is a different place.  Yeah, yeah.  Live as anything goes, however you're feeling, it's going to come out.  Well, they fixed the live shows a little bit.  We're adding a couple tracks here and there. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, but back in the day, they didn't do that.  Back in the day, they didn't do any of that shit, right?  That was always part of fucking like Ozzy's charm to me live was that he fucking would forget  the lyrics.  Yeah.  His dyslexia would cause him to sing the verse, his reversed order.  I always loved that about him.  His voice would cry.  He hasn't been able to do Symptom of the Universe since they fucking did it in the studio.  He can't do that live.  He would always go, Symptom.  He would always just grovel it out.  I fucking love that.  Yeah, because it's real.  Yeah.  It's real.  If he came out there playing to a tape, it would suck.  That's like I said, the fact that he fucks up, makes mistakes, makes it great. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, wrong words, the band doesn't know where to go.  It's great.  I love that.  And you got, let's face it, 50%, at least 50% of the shows that we all see, it's a  guy with an inbox with all the parts on there and they're playing to the tapes and it's  not like the old days like Guns N' Roses or enough stuff where you plug in and you play  and if it sucks, guess what?  We drank all night, we fucked and we're high and we're not going to sing and play good  tonight.  It's a bad night.  Everybody has them.  You don't see a baseball player hitting four for four.  Yeah.  You know, the guy's going to strike out a few times, he's going to hit some ground balls 
[03:13:30]  and then all of a sudden he might have a good day where he hits a home run.  But for the most part, it's not consistent.  It's really tough to see.  I don't know any bands, even seeing Queen when I was a real little kid, they weren't that  great live.  Thin Lizzy blew them away.  Yeah.  I love Queen.  They're a fucking great show and I love Freddie Mercury.  But sometimes probably too much cock one night.  Way too much.  Just not feeling good.  They were notorious for doing more, you know, they had bindles, like coffins full of cocaine,  you know?  So that's all those guys did.  They had the biggest, most extravagant parties back then. 
[03:14:00]  Tons of cocaine, tons of trim, action packed every single night.  And you're going to get a bad show once in a while.  Yeah.  Now it's the inbox.  You hit the inbox, play and record, go, and everybody got a couple of good guys that  played for it.  Yeah, play along to it.  It's not the same.  No, it's not the same.  Chip, we've talked about it over the years.  We're lucky enough to get to go backstage for probably 20 years now.  And we've seen the change.  Now you go backstage and everyone's, they're all vegetarians.  They're drinking their tea.  And it's like, what the fuck happened?  They got old. 
[03:14:30]  But then they're on stage playing the rock part.  A lot of people trying to go into heaven.  Yeah, it's funny.  As soon as they get done playing, they put their little shorts on and their little, you  know, or sweatpants or whatever.  Right.  The old days of the rock star coming out and looking like a rock star, when he walks out  his front door, he's a rock star.  And all day he's dressed like that.  That's his vibe.  That's his image.  Right.  You don't see it that much.  Yeah, I'm one of the last dying breed that I know.  These guys are all tatted up as they're eating their veggie burgers backstage.  Yeah, ridiculous.  We played the key club a couple weeks ago and there was some rap guy there. 
[03:15:00]  And after the show, he came up to me and said, he's never seen a live band.  You know, just plug in and play.  And he thought it was the greatest thing he's ever seen.  He said, I've never seen that before.  That was amazing.  I said, well, that, and he was younger, obviously.  Yeah.  That's where the music from your samples come from, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  All the shit you're biting off, it was played by somebody at one point.  Amazing.  You know, hearing it live and hearing it when I hit the snare, sometimes, you know, I won't 
[03:15:30]  miss the snare, but I won't get a great hit on it.  It'll go, bang, bang, gonk.  That's real.  Yeah.  Steven, trust me, you're safe.  I preface this by saying that, nothing will happen to you whatsoever, but we do work with  one of the, no, probably the biggest Guns N' Roses fan ever.  And when he met, who was it, Duff McKagan for the first time? 
[03:16:00]  Duff was in, yeah.  What did he end up doing?  Sticking a banana up his ass to show his appreciation?  I mean, this guy is hardcore.  But he's G.G. Allen.  Hardcore fan.  I'll set him for a big hug.  He doesn't eat the banana.  Are we, is Eastside Dave coming in to say hi to Steven Adler?  All right.  Chip, you might want to protect your buddy here.  God, nothing's going to happen.  Okay, good.  But this guy is.  Dave is just, come on in, Dave.  Look, look.  He's got his, he's got a guitar.  He's got his guitar, hero guitar.  I know Dave.  How do you know Dave?  You know Dave?  How do you know Dave? 
[03:16:30]  From yesterday.  I know Dave.  From yesterday.  From yesterday.  I love this.  What's this yesterday?  Did I talk to him yesterday?  Oh.  Yeah.  David, what do you want to say to Steven Adler?  I just want to say he's my favorite drummer of all time.  For real.  This is real.  Know me.  Calm down.  You can't talk.  Calm down.  I know.  But I'm a drummer and I get a little bit excited.  I play the drums just because of Steven Adler and I'm not just joking around. 
[03:17:00]  That's why I became a Gene R fan.  Mr. Brownstone, you know, My Michelle, all these songs.  I could sing a little bit if you want.  Yeah, sure.  I think Steven would appreciate it because I don't think he's heard these songs in a while.  I know you're always looking for lead singers and I could do whatever you want.  Yeah, why don't you put the guitar down?  You need a little room for this.  Steven, you might want to sit down and enjoy this.  Let's do a little Mr. Brownstone.  A little Mr. Brownstone.  This is what Steven, to me, represents because he plays the shit out of the drums on this opening 
[03:17:30]  song.  You want to hear a little of the song?  You want headphones or you don't need them there, Dave?  I'm a fucking pro, just like Steven is.  All right, why don't we start the song?  And then afterwards, we're going to have some hot dogs or something.  Yeah, this is for you, Steven Adler.  All right.  This is real.  Here we go.  A little Brownstone.  Come on, Steven!  Come on, baby!  Oh, Christ.  Yeah!  Dave is dancing.  I got the snake dance.  You look good.  Now, this is what we do. 
[03:18:00]  I'm from New Jersey.  You're from California.  We both had hard lives growing up.  Come on!  Yeah!  You like it?  I love it.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  I get up around seven.  Get out bed around nine.  I don't worry about nothing, no.  Because learn to waste my fucking time.  Yeah!  All right!  Welcome Sirius XM, Steven Adler, baby! 
[03:18:30]  I don't know.  Nah, not, no!  Well, let me know  No, no, no  Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh 
[03:19:00]  He'd do it, but I don't would do it  So a little got more and more  I just keep try'na get a little best  And a little better than me, no  I used to do a little, but a little wouldn't  Do it, so a little got more and more  I just keep try'na get a little  Best i'll get more  Leave it down to it  Mr. Brownstone  Leave it down  He won't leave me alone  I don't know 
[03:19:30]  You're my favorite  I love you too  I love you so much  When you signed my guitar right there  Oh my god  God damn Dave  Jumping in a circle  Dave  You missed this  He used everything to me  I know  That isn't even any bullshit  Everyone knows that about you  Listen let's get  Let's talk for some brass tacks 
[03:20:00]  Matt Sorum's a big fat pussy  No one's fucking not bullshitting around  Do you think  And I love Matt Sorum  But his drumming was a little bit lazy  Didn't have the razzle dazzle  Matt Sorum is a great  Drumming machine  He doesn't play  He's not full of feel  He's missing the Stephen Adler soul  He doesn't have the feel  The heart and the soul  But he's a great drummer  He's missing Stephen Adler spirit  Fucked up news illusion 
[03:20:30]  But it's not his fault  You are still out of shape  They're both  Stephen's trying to catch his breath  Dave is so out of shape  You're a mess  I know  I was wearing my lucky shirt  For Stephen  But  My lucky shirt  Yeah  Steven  Let's also talk about  Shitty drummers  The guys from  Bon Jovi  He's not very good  He's great  He does fucking awesome  Okay  What about Keith  Was he your favorite drummer  No  Roger Meadows Taylor  Is my favorite drummer  Okay  Oh really  Yeah 
[03:21:00]  The high voice  The singing  Is that what you like  No I love his playing  And the singing  I could sing backup  For you guys  No  Couldn't I  No you're right  But no  If you want to  Come to the show  Then you can  I will be  When is the show  Tonight  Tonight  Tomorrow  Every shit  Every day  For the next two weeks  We're playing somewhere  Can I come on Thursday  On Saturday  Long Island  Friday  Alright  Listen  Seems like this is  Petering out  Thank you for signing my guitar

Yes I go to a funeral twice a week  You do? 
[03:25:00]  Yeah  For people you know or just out of boredom?  No  No yeah whenever I see one going on I stop in  You go to the parties after free catering?  No no no just the funerals  Weird  Well at this point Anthony wasn't in the studio this day  Because he was attending a funeral  So we had Joe DeRosa filling in  And the guys decided to talk about weird experiences  That they've had in the past at funerals  Well strange things happen at funerals  And that's an element that doesn't often get explored  When discussing funerals of loved ones  But thank god there's the Opie and Anthony show  To do just that 
[03:25:30]  Sam have you been to many funerals in your life?  Yes I go to a funeral twice a week  You do?  Yeah  For people you know or just out of boredom?  No yeah whenever I see one going on I stop in  You go to the parties after free catering?  No no no just the funerals  Weird  Well at this point Anthony wasn't in the studio this day  Because he was attending a funeral  So we had Joe DeRosa filling in 
[03:26:00]  And the guys decided to talk about weird experiences  That they've had in the past at funerals  Well strange things happen at funerals  And that's an element that doesn't often get explored  When discussing funerals of loved ones  But thank god there's the Opie and Anthony show  To do just that  Holy shit this is stupid  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony  Five minutes into it you're like what the fuck  On the virus series XM  Joe DeRosa filling in for Anthony today 
[03:26:30]  Anthony's at a funeral  Those are always fun  That sucks  Yeah  I hate funerals  I mean you know everyone does  But I'll tell you why I hate them  Because you know your own sadness  You can kind of control  And then you go in the room  And everyone else's sadness brings you down to a level  That you had no intention of going down to  You know the relative that falls down on the ground  And the other one that is like you know  Crawling her way into the coffin 
[03:27:00]  Yeah  Take me with you  It's like this already sucks  Do you have to make it worse for everybody else  Yeah  Now you're just being embarrassing  Right  Just pull it together  This is  I always  I'm so out of touch with my emotions  I go to a funeral  And the whole time I'm like  I don't understand why I'm not sad right now  Why am I not crying  And then I have that moment at the cemetery  Where I have a complete breakdown  And need like my mom to hold me  I'm like oh there's all that suppressed emotion  Yeah that forever thing really creeps you out 
[03:27:30]  Oh my god  I remember my grandma  I think she was like 92 when she passed  90 somewhere around there  Same thing  I was cool until we got to the cemetery  And then we're in this like beautiful  I don't even know what it's called  In the cemetery  Where they put the casket before they put it in the ground  It's this beautiful thing  And everyone gathers around  And puts the rose on the coffin  The final thing  And then me and my brother 
[03:28:00]  Because we're pretty damn curious  About just everything going on in the world  And life  We're like wow  What happens after this point right  And the priest is there  He's like this now concludes  The ceremony for your dead grandma  Meaning go home  And now the coffin's just sitting there  We're like screw that  So we kind of hung out  And they wheel it out the back  And then you see the hole that is freshly dug  And it's a bunch of Mexicans  In this case it was  With shovels 
[03:28:30]  Like looking at their like watches  Like can we get this over with  We want to do lunch  You realize it's just their job  To get this dumb coffin in the ground  And get some dirt over it  So they can move on to their next task  That's a bummer isn't it  Yeah you think it's some glorious thing  That happens after you leave the cemetery  But no they're pretty much  And you know they're not going to be  You know careful with the coffin  They're going to drop that thing  Yeah they drop the one end in first  Oh I'm sure 
[03:29:00]  And then your grandma's got a crooked neck  For eternity  When my grandfather died  He was in the Knights of Columbus  And when he died  The you know they sent the Knights of Columbus  To the service  To the church service part of the funeral  To give him you know his send off  And everybody you know  The whole family was like  It's going to be really nice  And this is really special  And the Knights of Columbus came in  And they gave this speech  For my grandfather  And they go  They go  We will miss and honor your memory  Joe De La Rosa 
[03:29:30]  And my fucking family was livid  My uncle's in the lobby of the church  They can't get the fucking name right  Jesus  Like  Yeah  Oh my god  It was brutal  But then they did the  You want to talk about getting choked up  He was in World War II  They did the military  Oh yeah  Salute at the grave  And this soldier  Who didn't even know  He never even met my grandfather  Did the speech and the salute  He started crying  Because he got so worked up 
[03:30:00]  About like the honor  You know what I mean  Of the soldier  Sure  And it was brutal  That's when I broke down  Yeah that's heavy stuff  And then they hand the flag  Oh Jesus dude  And our families  You know they handed it to my mom  Because my dad was a military guy  Yeah that's a moment  Yeah right  Oh wow  Yeah  Wow  That's hardcore dude  Nothing but respect for those guys  Because they didn't know my father  But they played right through to the end  But there's something so impressive too  About a guy that just like  You know to see those soldiers 
[03:30:30]  Like to see somebody that believes in something that much  And is that passionate about it  You're like  You know you don't see that very often obviously  I don't see it in myself  You know I lose interest in the  You know I'll drift off halfway through this conversation  Yeah passionate about  Furthering the agenda of a fascist regime  Oh boy  Did Bill Hicks just walk in here  People who just knee jerk react against the military 
[03:31:00]  Think what  Oh my god  Steven S. from Bayshore  I'm not even sure if he's going for the joke here  Because this is part funny and part true  Hey Ope  Have you ever whispered about another relative  And said hey  She's ruining the funeral  Yes  I have  You've actually said those words  Not the one in the casket  Because there's always one that just brings you down  To a level that you had no intention of going to 
[03:31:30]  Yeah  You know I  I had a string of people die in my family  And you know  You mourn privately after all that's done  In general  But some people they have to let it all out  Right there in front of everybody  You know what the worst is  Do you ever  Like the people that get that fake fucking  They get that fake sentiment  At a moment like that  Where they're just standing there going  Life man  Oh yeah  Oh fuck off  Yeah  You know this sucks  Let's go get wasted  This sucks  In my family 
[03:32:00]  There are the cool members of the family  That are in the back  While the body's up front  And they're in the back of the room  Making jokes  And just having a good old time  You know  I like that  Yeah  I like that  I love the ones that try to make  They try to be so positive  They're like  You know  Someone's dead  They're like  Why are we all so sad  Because they're dead  Asshole  We get it  They're in a better place  They're not in a better place  The Mexicans are dropping them  In the fucking hole  Yeah  They're in a terrible place  They're dead  Well  We got some guys  That worked at a cemetery 
[03:32:30]  I don't even know  If we want to go down this road  Yeah  Of course we do  Let's go to Pittsburgh  And say hi  To Tim  Pittsburgh  A big O&A market  What's up Tim  Hey boys  How you doing  Pretty good  Joe DeRosa  Filling in for Anthony  Doing a great job today  I just want to say  Joe  Thanks  Go ahead Tim  Hey I used to work  In a cemetery  And I got a fucked up story  If you want to hear it  Sure  All right  So the wife is grieving  And this is all just so  Everybody's crying  I know I'm used to it  Whatever  Let's throw him  In the fucking ground  And let's go to lunch 
[03:33:00]  We're lowering him in  To the ground  Into the vault  Because the casket  Goes in the cement vault  And the fucking straps break  The fucking coffin  Falls down there  And there's an arm  Hanging out  And everybody  Loses it  Loses it  My boss looks  I'm just in college  He's like  Get down there  And I'm like  What the fuck  Do you mean  Get down there  He's like  Get in there  Motherfucker  Look at them  They're losing it  I had to go in there  And put the arm back in  Sweat it off  Oh my god  You talk about  Having a bad day  That's all it would take  To an arm  Popping out of one 
[03:33:30]  Of those effing coffins  It was the worst  The widow lost it dude  She lost it  I don't mean to laugh  All right boys  Punch it out  Have a good day  Good job Tim  Let's go to John  In Indiana  John  Yeah  They make sure  You're good and dead  They also put water  Inside the golf  In there  To make  You know  The level of ground  So you know  That way you fucking drown  If they're not dead already  Wait they put water where?  No way  They put water in a hole  Yes  Settle the ground  They fill the hole full of water 
[03:34:00]  All right  And then that water  Kind of like  You know  Goes into the earth  Did you hear what  His explanation  In case you're not already dead  You'll drown  Right  All right  Thank you John  Let's go to New Hampshire  Ken  This is a humane way  Of doing it  Hey Ken how are you?  Not too bad  How are you doing?  Pretty good Ken  Yeah  Same story  Like the guy  The guy before  Was talking about  How the arms fell out  Yeah  We were doing a removal  Where somebody  Was a veteran  Getting moved to a  To a veteran cemetery  So you have to dig down  In the coffin  The guy had been in the hole 
[03:34:30]  For eight years  Cement box  So the cement's all  It's pretty much just like clay  It's really soft  My boss goes  Hop down in the hole  I jump down in the hole  I go right through the box  Right through the coffin  I'm standing on the guy's chest  I crush  Yes  My boss goes  Jesus Christ  Thank God the fucking family's not here  Can I tell you how great Carlin was  His bit about how  How fucking  The ritual of burying the dead 
[03:35:00]  We have a homeless problem  He's like  Just get rid of the graveyards  He's like  It's an old idea  Just plow those motherfuckers  Into the river  And fucking use the land  And put people  It's a great bit  And it really is  Is it a long bit?  We should play that  I honestly don't remember  It might just be a line he used  I don't remember where it was  Do a little research  See if it's a little bit we can play  Because you know  Nothing wrong with playing some Carlin  It is creepy  Like my mom's real  You know I come from an Italian family  My mom's real big  I'm like let's go visit the grave  And I never go with her 
[03:35:30]  I'm like I don't want to do that  It's weird  Like  It's just weird  I go every once in a while  To my dad's site  And it's like  Alright  Now what  And he didn't believe in that either  So I guess I got that from him  Because he told me  He never went to his own dad's grave  So I'm like  Why am I at your grave then?  And every time you go to a grave  You have to do that obligatory  Tap the head stuff  I miss you buddy  You know  Like you have to do all that  You have to have the speech  It's just  It's like  It's awkward  It's  Do as far as Gump did  Just throw them in the backyard 
[03:36:00]  Under a tree  Fucking mosey out  Chat with them  Then go inside  Take a nice fucking coffee shit  Go on with your day  I don't go to  I don't ever go to  To graves  It's creepy  Just think about the person  You don't need to stand  On their corpse  Just think about them  Yeah exactly  And tell a story about  How a candle blew out  And you knew it was them  Should we  Yeah  You knew they were in the room with me  Really?  Out of the window was open  Fucking shit  Shut up  They weren't in the room with you  Wouldn't that creep you out? 
[03:36:30]  If you were having a moment  And grandmother blew out the kill  Cause that had me start to think  Like she was in the car  Every time I got blown  By a fucking prostitute  She was there  Every time I clicked  Clicked on questionable websites  Or  Ran out of steam  In a joke  Like there  Did I tell a story on the air  When  When we were going through  When we were going through  My dad's wake  It was in a funeral home  Where they had  You know  Two or three other  Wakes going on  But like  Ours ended  Then the other one started  Or somehow  They were able to  Kind of organize this whole thing  And I was bored  Cause I had to be there  The whole time 
[03:37:00]  Had to  Sorry dad  I mean  You know  He probably would have  Only done a couple hours himself  That's where I got it from  And  He didn't believe in all that  But  I started wandering around  The funeral home  And there was an empty room  With all the chairs set up  Coughing in the front of the room  Walked up  Once again  Being curious about crap  Walked to the front of the freaking room  There's grandma  Not my grandma  Someone's grandma  But the stereotypical grandma  The  The cotton  Candy hair  That's kind of bluish 
[03:37:30]  Pearls  Really nice  Like Sunday outfit on  Just laid out  The casket is open  Waiting for the freaking wake  I lean in to take a  Closer look  Swear to god  The lights go off in the room  Oh  Jesus  And to this day  I really need to know  Why the lights went off  Oh my god  I'm wondering if it was someone  I mean  I got some jokesters in my family  And if one of them was around  They could have maybe  You know  Quickly turned the lights off and on  But I'm like  What the fuck is this about  Did you grab her tits  That would be the greatest story ever 
[03:38:00]  If the lights went on  It could be a ghost  And you just grabbed her tits  That's fucking hilarious  Like I know what you want  My grandma  When my  When my grandfather died  I had to sleep  I had to stay at my grandmom's house  For like a week  For all the stuff  Whatever  And I had to sleep  In the bedroom  I used to sleep in  When I was a kid  When I'd stay at her house  When I was a kid  It freaked me out  And I've never gotten over it  And you know  It's already sad and weird  Because he's dead and everything  And I'm laying in the bed  Trying to go to sleep  And I roll over  And I'm all creeped out already 
[03:38:30]  I roll over  She moved the chair  That he always sat in  Into the fucking room  And it's directly  Like in my eyeline  Next to the bed  And I'm like  So now I'm starting to think  I'm going to wake up  He's going to be sitting  In the goddamn chair  And I was like  Thanks Nana  This week wasn't traumatic enough  Yeah you had to make it worse  Yeah we're in this fucking  Poltergeist situation right now  Okay yeah  Let's take a few more  Of these morbid calls  Highway from North Carolina  Hey what's up guys  Hey Highway  Hi  Yeah the worst thing is 
[03:39:00]  When they play  A song right before  They take the body  To the grave site  And you know  All the families there  Listening  My grandparents  Ruined  Everybody Hurts  By R.E.M.  No one can listen  To that song now  But why even  It's amazing  Why play that stupid song  Yeah why bring you down  Even  I'm not a fan  Of bringing you down  Further than you already are  Like there's music  That could accent  All this stuff  And make you feel  Way worse  There's nothing positive 
[03:39:30]  Coming out of playing  Everybody Hurts  At a funeral  One of the worst  Saddest songs  Ever already  You know what song  I can't do  Is a time of  What is it called  The Green Day song  Time of Your Life  Yep  Or whatever it's called  Yeah  What's that song  I don't know it  I can't even hear it  Seriously for real  Cause same thing  They ruined it for me  All I can think of  Is  This is at a funeral  Think of this  But think about  How hip his parents are  They're listening to R.E.M.  My parents would  My parents would have  Played some Glenn Miller  But why not  Play something 
[03:40:00]  A little like  Uplift  This is not uplifting  At a funeral  The Pennsylvania polka  Right  And then everybody  Runs through  And punches the body  In the face  If you're having  A threesome  This song  Is it gonna bring you up  Oh Jesus Christ  Is it gonna bring you down  Could you imagine dude  Just playing this song  You got two chicks  Naked on your couch  Hold on girls  They're gonna set the mood  Right  And you just start  Sharpening a knife to it  The hottest naked  Broads ever  And there you are  Crying like a baby  Everybody hurts  Why 
[03:40:30]  Why do we do this  To ourselves  I know  Oh now I gotta hang up  Alright  Yeah yeah alright  I'm sorry bro  And then you know  Like  This is the final song  That's the other thing  About  When someone dies  You walk around  Like a zombie  For three days  It's  You're a zombie  If you wanna know  What a zombie  How a zombie lives  You know  When someone dies  That's close to you  You're gonna find out  Cause that's all you do  Alright now  It's time to go  To my aunt's house  For the six foot  Hero  And pasta dish 
[03:41:00]  Alright now  We have to go  And visit  Where she used to live  Alright now  We're gonna go  To my mom's house  Like it's  You just wander around  For three days  Like a zombie  That is the only good part  About a funeral  Is you get that  Carnival food afterwards  Right  Hot roast beef  And meatballs  Yeah  That's alright  Usually get together  For a meal  And make believe  That the person  Didn't die  All of a sudden  Everything's happy  It's just the dumbest thing  I hate it  Yeah it sucks  I hate it  What's your ethnicity 
[03:41:30]  By the way  What are you  I didn't even know  I'm a mutt  I'm gonna guess  You're a little German  Irish  Tiny Irish  A lot of people  A lot of people  Think I'm very Irish  But I have barely  Any Irish in me  I got  Unfortunately  I got a lot of Polish  Quarter Polish  Is the big one  The reason I ask  German  Aunt would be proud of that  Little Irish  I have a grandfather  That's from Canada  So whatever the hell  He was  Yeah  Do you guys do a lot of 
[03:42:00]  Do you do like  The drinking thing  No  Because Irish and Italian  After a funeral  You just get  Loaded  Not a lot of drinkers  In my immediate family  The uncles  Well they're another story  So yeah  They rock  Well yeah  It helps after a funeral  It kind of takes  The sting off  Well the phones are lit  Do you want to keep  Absolutely  I'm talking about  This shit all day  You tell me which one  You want  Had to bury your father  Twice  Casket fell sideways  I say that's a good one  Alright  Let's go to Ty  In Atlanta  Ty  Yeah how's it going 
[03:42:30]  Hey buddy  My father-in-law  At his funeral  He was a big dude  One of the straps  Broke  The casket fell in  Sideways  They couldn't get it  All the way in  They had to take it  Back out  Well then it wouldn't  Fit in the vault  So  My wife and her sister  Had to have two funerals  And we had to go back  The next day  And do it all over again  Oh my god  To say they were a wreck  Yeah  And then the guys  That did it  Didn't really seem  To give a shit  One way or another  They were just trying  To get out of there 
[03:43:00]  No it's their job  We all have jobs  And that's  We just want to get  The job done  We don't think of  The emotional part of it  Did you laugh  Did people laugh  I mean like  Something like that  Could be horrific  Or everybody could just laugh  Well everyone was  Pretty much gone  And it was just  Just the immediate  Family around  Yeah  The girls didn't take it  Too well  No  And then the next day  Wasn't a whole lot better  You know  Now you talk about it  It's not a big deal  They can laugh about it 
[03:43:30]  But at the time  It was pretty traumatic  Sure  Yeah right on  Watching other people sad  Makes me sad  Like if I'm in a funeral  That's the worst part  Like there are people  Who are just  Not even being drama whores  That's what I'm saying  Who are just fucking  That's the worst  But I get pissed  I'm like  I don't need to see this  Yeah it's  Go outside  It's brutal  It's almost like  Is this necessary right now  I mean you gotta grieve  And you gotta respect  What just happened  But is it necessary  Yeah  It's almost like a wedding  It gets to a point  Where it's almost gaudy 
[03:44:00]  Where you're like  This is too much  We're indulging too much  In this thing right now  The wake was enough  We all came out  We looked at the body  We went up  We knelt there  You go down the line  And shake the hands  That's enough  You don't have to go  To the cemetery  And watch them lower  A casket into the ground  Patrick K from Texas  Oh well the screen  Just went dead  Hey Opie  I wonder if someone  Tossed a Rosen bag  On Mark Fidrich's  Mound of dirt  He's under now  I am  You don't know 
[03:44:30]  Who Mark Fidrich is  I don't know why  That fell flat  That is a funny joke  Do you know  Who Mark Fidrich is  I think we're  Hoping for the  Joe DeRosa laugh  You got a good laugh  You should have laughed there  Who was Mark  Mark Fidrich died  Early this week  You don't know  Who Mark Fidrich is  He had one of the  Greatest rookie seasons  In baseball history  Are you a sports guy  I don't follow sports  At all  That's why  Mark Fidrich comes out  Of nowhere  What happened  Oh  No I was  You hit a button  You're going to try  To hit a button 
[03:45:00]  No but I was going to  I didn't want you to  I was just saying  I was just signaling  When you say this  I'm going to hit a button  Okay  But sorry  Mark Fidrich  Mark Fidrich  I believe  Rookie season  Went 19-9  He was a sensation  He would talk to the ball  He would pat the mound  He was a lunatic  And baseball fell in love  With this guy  And then what happened  After that  He just sucked  I think he had an injury  Or something  He must have got hurt  Yeah  And then he only  Made it five years  In the major leagues  After a 19-9 
[03:45:30]  First season  His career record  Was I think  29-19  So he went 10-10  Over the next four years  Complete disaster  Then he tried to come back  With the Red Sox organization  82 or 83  I sound like mad dog  I got all this in my head  But he didn't make the comeback  Okay  So he retires  And he's like a truck operator  In Northboro, Massachusetts  And now  You know  They need his truck  Because of all the potholes  In the Massachusetts area  And he's under his dump truck 
[03:46:00]  Getting it ready for the season  And something went horribly wrong  And Mark Fidrich  Is no longer with us  Oh Jesus Christ  My thing is this though  Like how much did he make  Because if it was  Sometimes you hear about  Those sports stories that suck  Yeah  And then you figure  Look if the guy got hurt  Let's say he made  Say six million dollars  Well probably back then  That's a lot of money  For a young guy  They didn't get paid  Six million up front  But if he made  Five or six million bucks  You know  Thirty years ago  If you invested it right  Alright you got a great life  After that  But I guess Don Mattingly 
[03:46:30]  When Mattingly made  Nineteen and a half million  For five years  That was considered  An outrageous salary  So I imagine  Fidrich didn't get near that  Do you want to kiss me?  Fuck you  It was the button  It didn't fit  But yet somehow  I'm okay with it  You wanted me to cover the buttons  I don't know what it said  I'm not looking at all  I'm not looking at all  That was just awkward  For everyone though  Maybe Mark owned  That trucking company  Maybe that was his thing  Maybe he owned the truck  Yeah maybe he invested  His money in that 
[03:47:00]  You'd like to think he did  I loved that guy  When I was growing up  I'm like this guy's a lunatic  He yelled at the ball  He was a weird guy  Yeah look up some video  Of Mark Fidrich  If you care  Was he definitely broke  Or was he just doing  The truck thing  To keep himself busy  I don't know financially  Where he was at  I'm not sure  He probably didn't have  A big contract  If he was a rookie  Maybe he signed  For a couple nice years  Then memorabilia  He probably  Did alright for himself  He had signings  But that's why  Those guys charged to sign  People think they're being dicks  The older guys  Like when DeMond 
[03:47:30]  I never mind  When those older guys charge  Because they never made  Fucking 8 million  Or 9 million dollars  In a year  And they were better  Than half of these  Douchebags playing now  Sure  Rookie year  He made 16,000  Wow  Stop  Maybe  Hey rookie  Back in what was that  1979  I'm guessing  I think he was  He made his comeback  In 82 or 83  Alright yeah  Late 70s  Late 70s  76  I was 8 years old  That's amazing  That's like the money 
[03:48:00]  You make when you  Start doing comedy  It's the same thing  You have this idea  Of this business  I can only get in  And make money  And then you make money  You're like  Oh really  It was $20,000  You know what I mean  What is that today though  What is $16,000  Is there a way to look  Convert that  Because it's like  I'm guessing  It's like 40 grand today  It's still the shit  I was going to guess 45  Oh Joe  Let's not quarrel  I'm going to guess  37,500  Really  I like that you  Threw the 500 
[03:48:30]  Come on Dan  It's amazing  Danny can pull up  Fucking like  If you mention  Like a fucking  An African hemorrhoid  He's got a photo of it  In 30 seconds  But a simple math equation  I got no idea  Let's challenge Danny  With that one today  African hemorrhoid  After you find the answer  To the Mark Fidrich question  That'll probably be  Way easier than that  That's what he was saying  I accidentally  Set grandfather's  Graveyard on fire  In Japan  When he cremated  Family takes the bones  My friend was buried  In the wrong grave  You tell me which one  You want here Jimmy 
[03:49:00]  My family has fights  At funerals  I hate when they play taps  Let's go with the fights  Because taps I don't mind  Taps is a military thing  Let's go with  Or coughing  I don't mind taps either  Because you're right  Military thing  It's when you take the pop song  That's when you take the pop song  That's going to bring everyone down  Yeah taps is respectable  We had funeral home  Cut man's legs off  Because he was too long  For coughing  That's a good one  That's uh  Yeah because you don't want  To wreck up the  The cemetery  Of the cemetery  That's an episode  Of Tales from the Crypt  I don't  You're not buying it  No  Alright let's find out  Jack South Carolina 
[03:49:30]  Hey fellas  Welcome aboard Jack  Hello Jack  This is your best show yet  The new studio  I just want to say  But anyways  Hey listen yeah  This guy died  He was 6 foot 7  This happened in Allendale  South Carolina  So you can look it up  6 foot 7  And it turns out  That the casket  That they bought  Wasn't long enough  So unbeknownst  To the family  The funeral home  Cut his legs  At the ankle  And at the calf  And just put his shoes  On his feet  And then buried him 
[03:50:00]  And then had the  Had the funeral  And everything  And then buried him  And they  They exhumed his body  Back in 2004  They just exhumed his body  And it turned  They cut his legs off  So he would fit  In the casket  Why they exhumed the body  Who gives a fuck  Yeah  And the name of the funeral home  Was the cave funeral home  And they did it  Because  Well because I guess  It's like desecrating a body  Or something like that  You know what  You can get him in a box  And fucking throw dirt on him  Is there  Is there a worse  Sentence than  Exhumed the body 
[03:50:30]  Every time you hear about  A body being exhumed  Yeah  And you see like  The backhoe  In a cemetery  Some guy's been dead  For 30 years  And they need to  Exhumed the body  Yeah  Like I was a preacher  Anytime they exhume a body  They're looking for  Traces of semen  Or something  I have the answers  And now this guy's  Just throwing out weird facts  Guy's a preacher  Yeah  Alright  Thank you sir for calling  And a democrat  Alright  We buy it  It wasn't a chance  From the dark side  He had bunions  He's now walking around  Like a goat  Alright  Can we go home now please 
[03:51:00]  How much was it Dan  Well according to this  Inflation calculator  16,076  Would roughly be about  60,000 in 2008  Okay  That's still shitty  Because right now  Thanks to Travis  Traipsing in  Minimum 2008  Baseball salary  390  $390,000  Is the minimum  You can make  Thanks to the  Fucking  Baseball union  Yeah  Jesus Christ  Can we go with  The exhume the body  A little more  I just need to  I don't know  I don't know  Where to go with this  But  Well one body 
[03:51:30]  They should have  Exhumed  To shut a lot of  People up  Or maybe they didn't  Because they didn't  Feel they needed to  Was the Kennedy body  I mean  Because there's rumors now  Because there's always  Like what happened  To the brain  Of the president  Where is it  Right  And then there's rumors  That there was another  Private service held at night  Where they said  Bobby Kennedy allegedly  Put certain  Things in the  The casket  And they think that  That was parts of the body  Like the brain  And things like that  But they could  Exhumed the body  I'm a Catholic  In the Catholic faith  Don't you have to have  The whole body in there  Well maybe because  It was blown apart  Or the all type 
[03:52:00]  There might have been  A reason  Yeah  Well yeah  Well the body was in  All sorts of labs  Disarray  Yeah it was here and there  And everywhere  Wait body  Wasn't that the book  That Bilbo Baggins wrote  Wait a minute  You said Bobby Kennedy  Put pieces of the brain  In the closet  No he allegedly  Placed something  In the casket  With Jack  You know  With the immediate family  There's a private service  Held for the immediate family  They had to look at the brain  And stuff  But who gets the job 
[03:52:30]  Of exhuming the body  Oh good  And then you have to open  That  The horror show  That is facing you  After that  That's all mummies are  Exhumed bodies  We're just digging up  People's relatives  And sending them around  The world  And going look  Look at this thing  Wrapped up  A little more on  Fidrich for the sports fans  That was  The family owned  The trucking company  So after Fidrich  You know  Stopped his baseball career  He had to move back 
[03:53:00]  To the family farm  And the family business  Yeah dude  He was fucking  He had such a talent  Proves there's no God  Didn't coach  Why would he do that  To Mark Fidrich  All he wanted to do  Was pat his mound  And talk to the ball  Maybe God did him a favor  Maybe he was an average talent  And God gave him  One good year  And said  Now go fuck yourself  You'll be dead under a truck  In 30 years  I like how you spin it  Now do you think  I have a question  For the two of you  Sure  Do you think that  Exhuming the body  As you asked  Who gets to do it  And you say coroner  Do you think the coroner 
[03:53:30]  Dreads that  Like dude  This isn't going to be  Good for anybody  Or do you think  He's like dude  You never get to  Fucking do this  We're going to dig  A body up today  I think they get excited  I think those creeps  Enjoy it  And by the way  Do you know why  It's worse than a mummy  Because a mummy  Isn't in a Sears suit  That's a good point  Mummies have wrappings  And gold things  They look old  And like you can't  Connect to them  You're right  You can't relate to a mummy  They look like  You're fucking  Uncle Murray  Right  Same socks  Mummies don't have socks 
[03:54:00]  Yeah you assume  The body  And the guy  Has a meth cap on  It's a bit creepy  Yeah  Well look  At least the suit held up  Yeah  That's a good change  They should bury you  In fucking  In like  What's the word  Biodegradable clothing  Because it is creepy  That the clothes survive  And you don't like  The suit they put you in  Will survive  For a thousand years  I mean there will be  Some remnants of the suit  There on your skeleton  It's fucking creepy  You exhume the body 
[03:54:30]  Of your uncle  And he's in a  Saturday night fever suit  Because  Because it was in  When he died  Or something  Out of a coke overdose  At Studio 54  Yeah  Right  In case  One pinky nail  Is a little longer  Than the other ones  The other pinky nail  Just keeps growing  Longer than the other ones  Right  Yeah that is weird  They should  They should just  Bury you naked  They should just  That's a  Fucking bury you naked  Why are they  Bury you in anything  Why are they  Wasting a suit  That's just gonna  Sit in the ground  Because you don't  Want your relative  To be cold  To be cold 
[03:55:00]  Alright  Well you get  The weird thoughts  Like you know  First aid range  You're like  Oh great  In a graveyard  Somewhere getting wet  Yeah I guess  You know  Are we done  With this morbid topic  I am  It's weird  I wanted to go  With the songs  A little more  And we had a few  But they had to hang up  Some of the songs  That we play  To make sure we're  Even sadder than we are  I wanna be cremated  I'm so claustrophobic  That's what my pops  Went for  Oh that's smart man  It's weird though 
[03:55:30]  Because like  His bones were like  His bones went one way  He always wanted to like  Donate his body  To science  But by the time he died  It was like  You know  He's older yeah  The only thing  They could really donate  Was some of his skin  And bones  Ugh  A little creepy  I think I might do that  I think I might donate  To science  Well then you gotta die young  Yeah  That's for the young  I very well may  I mean I'm not taking  Tip top care of myself  My pops made it  Into his 70s  So you know  What was left for science 
[03:56:00]  Yeah  My body is already  Like I'm in my 70s  Even if I died young  They'd be like  What the fuck  Are we gonna do with this  Looking at you  From the side  Joe looks like  An accordion  And a shirt  Creeps  And I'm not believing  I have body image issues  So I certainly get it  Let's go to Scott in Boston  Scott  Sorry Joe  That's okay  I'm thinking  Jimsy might have  Exhumed a few bodies  God damn  Why did I think of that  I don't know if  Jimsy's around today  It's amazing  Jimsy  Do we have  Jimsy around  I  I  I  I  I always get a  And I'm digging him up 
[03:56:30]  And bringing the family in  Why would you bring  The family in Jimsy  Because they get sad  Sam  Imagine the clueless coroner  Bringing the family in  Like oh you gotta check it out  You gotta check out  What has happened to the body  Since we buried it  Jesus  Just no clue  It's amazing  All this coroner talk  And I didn't  I forgot Jimsy existed  We're still  It's the worst of the  Opin' Anthony show  Sam we're talking about 
[03:57:00]  Bob Kelly having some  Strange obsession with you  Who doesn't at this point  You tried to explain to Bob  At one point  That a bromance  Is not what Bob thinks it is  It's not sexual assault  Yes  Bob Kelly is a rapist  Not a bromantic  No  We break it down for you  When we come back  And rips your pants off  We don't  Take it to a weird spot  You're listening to the worst  Of the Opin' Anthony show  On the virus  Sirius XM  You know Sam  A few years ago  The term bro 
[03:57:30]  Started to be used  In conjunction with  Other things going on in life  It was becoming almost like  A verb  An adjective  As well  To bro down  We're gonna have  A bromance  Yeah  And you used to watch  A show called Bromance  Oh yeah  There was that show  Bromance  It was a reality show  I think  Was it on MTV?  Yeah I'm sure it was  Either that or VH1  Well you're discussing  This show in studio  With Colin Quinn  And Otto Peterson  And as you're discussing  Bromance  And these kind of  Dumb things  They start to realize 
[03:58:00]  That Bob Kelly  Sort of has a bromance  Obsession with you  Yeah I mean  I tried to break down  The fact that  A bromance  And a romance  Are very different  And Bob Kelly's feelings  Are romantic  Not bromantic  And somehow  Pictures started circulating  Around the studio  Which appears to be  Bob committing a rape on you  Yeah I don't know  Anything about that  He assaults you a lot  I don't know anything  About that either  Hmm  Then where did we get  All this from?  I don't know  Just play the clip  I'm not here to talk about that  It's Bob Kelly  Fingering Sam's asshole  Bob Kelly's not even in this clip

[03:59:00]  With these words though  Men are not  Fucking coming up  With this shit  Here's the problem  It's these women writers  It's women writers  And it's also like  It's fine for like  Women and gay websites  Right  It's the whole thing  With fashion now  There's no fucking way  Any of us should know  Who you wear  We shouldn't know  Who fucking Roberto Cavalli  We shouldn't know  Any of these names  Of these fucking designers  And we all know them all  Because it's fine  In a certain segment  But now we all have to know it  Now we all have to know it  We all need things like  Bromance  And a guy like Sam  Who's obviously not effeminate  Or a metrosexual  He's the fucking

[04:03:30]  That doesn't really mean it  It's like Joyce  This is no bromance  He says it in such a way  You're like  Oh my god  He's kissed him  What have you been through  In your life  He's kissed him  He's like  Bobby is into twink guys  Yes  That is true  He's definitely into guys  That kind of  Are a little effeminate looking  No offense  But you're not the most  Yes he is  He's got kind of  A biracial  Kind of like  I'd say slight of frame  Yes  Slight of frame  You would say  Can you start growing a beard 
[04:04:00]  Just to see what it looks like  Yeah  Grow a beard  Let's see what that is  For like a week or two  Okay  Yes  No beard war  Or any of that crap  Just a quick little beard  To see what you look like  Just be like a week or two  Not like two years  Bobby's got a beard  His wife  Grow a beard  I want to see what that looks like  Okay  No more shaving  For at least two weeks  You know what  You've grown though  Does it come in fast?  No  No  So you're going to need  Two solid weeks  Two weeks  You've grown over the time  We've been here  You used to be a lot smoother  And more child looking

Oh as a twink  Like I don't see how Bobby  Still finds you attractive  Do you know how Bobby  I'd have probably fucked your  When you first got here  Yeah  But you're too hairy now  The hair  The hair ruins everything  Do you know how Bobby  Wants to fuck Sam  He wants to fuck Sam  Brutally  And on Sam's back  Yeah  Bobby  Bobby wants to missionary fuck Sam  Oh shit  So he can  Like really hard  And so he can kiss him 
[04:05:00]  With his big stomach  Hanging on Sam's  Young fucking  Slider frame  That is true  Oh fuck  Yeah  And Bobby would probably  Try to like convince himself  That Sam was enjoying it  So while he was fucking Sam  He would reach down  And just try to jerk Sam off  Between their stomachs  Oh god  His clumsy hand  Fucking big soft lips  Of god knows what nationality  Do you understand?  He would convince himself  That it was for both of you  Yeah yeah  Yeah why not?  You know  You don't even have to keep a secret 
[04:05:30]  Because you enjoyed it  He's been calling me at home  Again with the excuse  Of the Twitter thing  But he won't let me get off the phone  He's just like  Alright so you'll change it  And I go yeah  And then I'll just keep talking  Like he won't say  Don't hang up  Don't hang up the phone  Danny  Don't you hate when Bobby calls you  All the time like that?

[04:06:00]  He does to Sam  Cam up  Cam up  And put on that outfit  I sent you  And I think he's got a thing  With rolls too  Because he actually  He refuses to call me  He'll just text over and over again  Telling me to call him  I got a message on my Twitter  Two text messages  Call me  And then Travis had to text me  And say  Bob Kelly keeps texting me  Telling me to tell you to call him  Wow  But he won't call you  Wow  Because you're the bitch  Yeah  You have to call him  Wow  There comes Travis  Another twink  But he's got a beard by the way

[04:07:30]  Oh so you think  He had to really search it out  Yeah  Go through friends of friends of friends  Because why would he know my last name  Yeah  So  And he's like  Tell Sam to call me right now  I don't have his phone number  He needs to call me right now  Oh shit  There is definitely something going on  I'm not even joking  You know how else Bob would fuck Sam  Bob would fuck Sam  Bob would lay them both on their side  Right  Yeah  And Bob would lift Sam's left leg  And prop it up with his own leg  So he could fuck him  And then he could reach around  And grab Sam's dick 
[04:08:00]  Like kind of angrily  That he was so driven to fuck him  Like he was blaming Sam  For his sexual identity  Yes  Like you bastard  For being so attractive  He would like fuck him on the side  He would grab like Sam's dick  And balls together  Like one clump  And then  And then just kind of  Kiss his back and neck  And he would actually probably say  Come on baby  He'd probably call you a baby  Oh  Would you like that?  No  I wouldn't like it at all  Would you get excited?  No  Because he's playing with your dick and balls  So maybe it would be an involuntary  Kind of  Like you'd get hard anyway  We need to know why  We need to know why you're playing along Sam

[04:09:00]  And then grab your dick and balls again  To try to like  He's gotta do it fast though  Yeah  To try to whet it up  Yeah  He doesn't acknowledge that he did it  Yeah but he wants to act like  He's jerking you off  But if he just gets his hand wet  You'll escape  Oh that's terrible  I gotta go to the screen again there Colin  This was an internet sensation  Oh yeah  By accident  This made all the gay sites  Yes  Sam was playing quote  A role  Yeah  It's a character  A character called  Creepy Gay Kid
