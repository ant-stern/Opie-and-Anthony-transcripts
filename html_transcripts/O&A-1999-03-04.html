<pre> The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW that's the band Marblers 3 and Freak of the Week.  Like that song, like it a lot.  It's OP, it's Anthony and it's you listening.  What's up?  Huh?  What?  I'm sorry.  I knew you wanted to get into it right away.  I was dozing.  What?  What?  Well we've been here for what?  I think six hours now.  Oh my God.  Another of the stunning management meetings.  I love these things.  It's like Thursday, with a little memo, Thursday it's an air staff meeting. 
[00:30]
 Everybody attend.  Give me a break.  So we had to be here way too early.  See our whole show is about getting here at 2.30 and going on the air at 3.00.  Right with what we have just lived, you know?  And trying to be funny.  We prepare for our show in the car and that's it.  We live our little life and then we come here and share.  But when we have to come in four or five hours before our show, we might as well just write 
[01:00]
 off the show as a bad one.  Sitting in a meeting it just starts, I don't know, the talking is going but then I phase  out.  It turns into you know, well in a couple of weeks we're going to try to...  Yeah, here's me.  This is the tape of me in the meeting.  We're going to be focusing, looking at new avenues of execution of certain properties, 
[01:30]
 issues that we all...  What?  Oh my God.  You know, if I wanted to sit through meetings I would have done better in school.  Exactly.  I wouldn't have got a job as a radio guy.  All of a sudden I'm sitting there and I feel like I'm being talked...  Talking about the Magna Carta. 
[02:00]
 The Magna Carta was signed...  What?  Well, tell them what our meeting was about.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, Anthony, it was about all the new production elements we got for the radio station.  Was it?  I thought it was about my new shoelaces because I was playing with them.  All right, let me...  I need to do something.  All right.  And what we'll be doing is taking a new look.  Okay.  All right, what do you got? 
[02:30]
 Are you going to tell me what the meeting was about?  Yeah, the meeting was about how we have a ton of brand new production to play in between  songs.  Okay.  That's what I got out of it.  You did?  See, I didn't get that.  Now, tell me if you can tell the difference, okay?  This is a piece of old production.  Okay.  One, oh, two, seven.  N-E-W.  All right.  And that's the new production.  Okay.  What?  This is the old production. 
[03:00]
 One, oh, two, seven.  N-E-W.  Okay, that's the old production.  Okay.  All right.  But we've just added the new production.  Okay.  See, that's going to make a difference.  We're going to get a lot of new people listening because our production is updated.  Wait, I had to come in early for that?  Yeah.  That's what the meeting was about?  To listen to the new production. 
[03:30]
 See, I didn't get that.  Which sounds a lot like the old production.  Okay.  No, it's new, Opie.  All right, and then we got, oh, these are cute.  And then we were talking about these.  All right.  This is an example of a piece of production you will never, ever, ever hear on the Opie  and Anthony show.  Why?  What is this?  No, you're right.  You shall not be hearing that on our show.  We shan't be having a music marathon on our show, no.  But it's a new concept. 
[04:00]
 You're going to be hearing these a lot.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  They should make special ones for the Opie and Anthony show.  If you're lucky, you'll hear two songs in a row.  A talk marathon.  And honestly, oh, and then we have, oh, where's the special ID, Rick?  We don't even have that? 
[04:30]
 I just can't, you know, after, who are the people that ask questions in the meetings,  Opie?  Who are they?  It's like, okay, well, I'm done.  Any questions?  Yeah.  When should we play the one with the one round sticker on it?  The little sound thing.  The one round sticker.  And when should we play the one with two little round-armed stickers on it?  That's an interesting question.  I'm glad you have another hour. 
[05:00]
 Here, sit down.  All right.  And I was like, oh, I was out.  I was out of the meeting.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  All right.  One orange circle.  One orange circle on the label.  All right.  This is, here it is.  One, O, two, seven, N, E, W.  Okay.  Okay.  That's one orange circle.  One orange circle.  And this is now an example of a piece of production that has two orange circles on the card. 
[05:30]
 One, O, ten, six, N, B, W.  All right.  Wait, I'm a bit confused.  Why?  All right.  Let me explain it to you.  See, I was taking notes.  See, I was asleep.  Okay.  Oh, you had your notebook out and you were taking notes?  I noticed a couple of people had their notebooks.  All right.  The production piece with the one orange circle is short.  It's a short piece of production.  Okay.  So, this is one again.  One, O, two, seven, N, E, W. 
[06:00]
 All right.  Short.  Okay.  Short.  I'm glad you're filling me in on this.  All right.  I phased out.  That's three and a half seconds.  Okay.  That's a long piece of production.  Oh, okay.  Let me give you that example again.  Okay.  One, O, ten, six, N, E, W.  Well, that sounds pretty short too.  Yeah, but according to the production people and Gary, our boss, that's a piece of long  production.  Oh, hence the extra sticker.  Exactly. 
[06:30]
 Oh, my God.  The sad part is the one with the one orange circle is three and a half seconds and the  two orange circle production piece is five seconds.  That's the difference between short and long.  Well, that's nitpicking, isn't it?  Yes, it is.  Oh, my God.  Well, I'm glad you filled me in because I didn't have a clue what the meeting was about.  I see it was important and I'm glad we were there.  All right.  And then we're going to play these every once in a while.  Do it.  Do it now.  Killer Classics, today's best rock.  So, this is rock and roll.  One, O, two, seven.  Hosted by N, E, W.  All right. 
[07:00]
 I like that.  Now, you'll be hearing that piece of production when you're going out of like a Killer Classic,  like let's say The Who won't get fooled again.  Right, right.  And we're going to go right into like a Creed record.  So, tell everyone we're playing, you know, best Killer Classics and the best of the new  rock, Anthony.  All right.  This is what's going to get our ratings up around here.  OK.  I'm glad.  Good.  Any other examples you need?  No.  See, you filled me in in a matter of minutes.  What takes grueling hours in meetings. 
[07:30]
 But, Anthony, let's say you're going, you're coming out of like a really cool new record  like Creed and you want to go into The Who.  Oh, now what do you do, Opie?  Today's best rock, Killer Classic.  See, I'm about to find O's, McJangle's.  This is Steven Tyler.  Seven, W, N, E, W.  Boom.  All right.  It won't get fooled again.  It's backward.  It'll work.  Yeah.  Oh, OK.  All right.  Wow.  There you go.  That's what we learned today. 
[08:00]
 I bet we gained a couple of ratings points just you playing those.  All right.  But once again, I do want to remind people you definitely will not be hearing this piece  of production on our show.  Now, a music marathon.  Music marathon.  N, E, W.  OK.  I am ready to fall asleep.  Well, see, now the listeners understand the hell we were in because they're falling asleep. 
[08:30]
 They probably changed the dial like 15 minutes ago.  That's the problem.  Now, wait, wait.  No, no.  To get the full impact, we have to ask questions now about when these should be played, after  it's on.  And these were actual questions in the meeting.  It wasn't good enough that they just show us these production pieces and say, figure  it out, which you should be able to.  If you made it past the fifth grade, you figure it out on your own.  But no, then we had to have question and answer for what?  About a half hour?  Oh, painful. 
[09:00]
 Now, should I play the one with the two dots or the one dot?  And once again, honestly, the new production doesn't sound much different than the old  production.  Well, I don't know, Opie.  Maybe you just aren't, you can't judge these things for yourself.  Well, I guess not.  Probably.  But there you have it.  But then again, we have the really great production like that Clinton thing we just 
[09:30]
 had.  I can't.  All right.  I got to pull it together.  Well, meetings just blow.  They're a waste of time for everyone, no matter what type of job you have.  Everyone's trying not to make eye contact.  You look at the floor.  But one really good thing did come out of the meeting.  Besides introducing the new production elements that you'll be hearing all day long here, maybe  I'll play some of the old productions, see if you can tell the difference.  We also started a new concept today and the boss came up with this one. 
[10:00]
 Free Beer Thursday.  I guess he has finally realized that a lot of people just don't get along around here.  And the meetings are kind of stuffy and boring so you go in there and the only thing you  want to do is get out of the meeting.  Can't they spice up the meetings?  With what, like lap dances and stuff?  Yeah, something.  Because then you sit there.  You know, if a Buxom blonde came in, and like a little thong and like a little top, and  she was going over the production elements with us, I would have paid attention and I 
[10:30]
 would have taken notes.  Definitely.  So if the meetings were a little more spiced up, they wouldn't be so boring.  But the way they are, you don't talk to each other.  You're just yearning to get out of the meeting room.  Right.  So he figured that we loosen up on Thursdays, bringing some beers down the hall, and the  air staff can hang out and talk and exchange ideas.  Everyone is invited back starting at four for free beer Thursdays.  Yeah.  And the air staff can then talk with management or other air staff and exchange ideas without 
[11:00]
 these stuffy meeting atmosphere.  Yeah.  That will open up the lines of communication though with beer.  Oh, sure.  Well, think about it.  When you go to a party, yeah, it loosens up.  And there's no beer.  Let's say you go to a party and the keg's not there yet.  What do you do, Anthony?  You leave.  Or you just stand around and have that uncomfortable talk with the other people there wondering  when the keg is going to arrive.  Uh-huh.  I'm just waiting for the one free beer Thursday that ruins it. 
[11:30]
 When somebody gets a little too much free beer and I'm 23.  And people start speaking their mind.  Well, that could get ugly.  Unfortunately, we don't need beer to do that.  No.  That's what has gotten us in trouble.  We can't even use the excuse we were drunk.  No.  So, all right.  There you have it.  Any steel reserve or howling monkey out there?  Line two?  Uh-oh.  Hi, any W.  Hey, man, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey.  You think your meetings are bad?  I'm going through a five-hour practice meeting. 
[12:00]
 What is that?  It's a meeting before a meeting.  It's to get ready for the meeting.  You've got to go practice for five hours before you meet the client the next day to have the  same meeting for five hours the next day.  Oh, that would suck.  What line of work are you in?  What's that?  What line of work are you in?  After all these meetings, I have a tendency to forget.  Computer industry.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, they're known for some really cool meetings.  Oh, let me tell you, we've got some exciting people in these.  I don't see the meeting.  Anything can be explained in a memo or something.  The whole meeting thing is just...  I know it.  I don't get the meeting.  It's a power thing, I think.  They pass out dittos and stuff, and it's just silly. 
[12:30]
 I think it's so the bond between the two is that they're not going to be able to do it  if they don't do it.  They're going to be able to do it if they don't do it.  I think it's so the boss can get up at the head of the table and speak to his minions.  You know what I mean?  It's a power thing.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  You've got your practice meeting, you've got your meeting, and then you've got your post-meeting  memos.  Yeah.  We all have to sit down and put those together for the client afterwards. 
[13:00]
 No wonder no work gets done in this country.  Absolutely.  I'm glad we're making such a fortune for what we're getting done.  Yeah, we're all too busy going to meetings.  The truth.  The truth.  And I nod my head and act like I really care and stuff.  Yeah, you've got to make eye contact and smile and look interesting.  Meanwhile, in my head, I'm like, please, eyes stay open.  Please, please don't shut.  Don't shut.  And sometimes I lose the battle.  I find myself looking down and my eyes...  What?  What?  What?  It's horrible.  I can't sit in any more meetings.  So, phew. 
[13:30]
 All right, buddy.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  It's an N.E.W. meeting marathon.  Well, we had a great break about Monica that we wanted to do there, but instead we had  to talk about our boring meeting.  A little hotty she was last night.  And to the four people that are still listening to our show, stick around.  We've got more of this on the way.  Oh, hi.  The boss.  Hey.  Hey, look who's in the studio.  Scott, how are you doing?  Good, man.  How are you doing?  Good. 
[14:00]
 Good.  What do you think I enjoy having meetings?  This is the big boss.  You think I have nothing better to do than to sit there and stare at you?  I didn't say that.  The big boss then is pissed at you, Anthony.  I don't know what your stance is on meetings.  I'm just saying I don't enjoy meetings.  I know a lot of other people that have called in.  They hate meetings, too.  Who do you think does more meetings, you or me?  I would say probably you.  We have never done a meeting.  No, no.  The only time we do meetings is with...  You guys, everybody bitches about the communication problems. 
[14:30]
 Nobody understands.  Well, there's no real...  Nobody does it right.  You've got nine, ten, twelve jocks all doing twelve different things.  Do you think that's actual communication in those meetings up there?  Well, the best part is everybody bitches about communication.  Any questions, nobody raises their hand.  Of course not.  Like any meeting, you just want to get out of there.  Except for Eddie.  Eddie.  Oh, God, we hate when people ask questions.  The questions are really bad.  Did you notice I was paying attention?  I was paying attention.  I just rehashed the whole meeting and what we learned today. 
[15:00]
 It's like the people that raise their hand in school and go, you forgot the homework.  You know, it's like, God, we were almost out.  It's like shopping with your wife and you're almost out of the store and she goes, oh,  look at this dress.  You're like, I was almost out of...  Yeah, but you give me this impression.  It's a power struggle.  No, no.  I said power trip.  We've got to have the meetings.  It's a power trip.  Well, now, wait a minute.  You go to meetings.  You say you're in a lot of meetings.  You have to go to some meetings where you are the guy that kind of takes some crap. 
[15:30]
 You're not at the head of the table.  So upstairs, you get the head of the table.  So that's sort of a power thing.  You must be like, all right, now I'm at the head of the table.  Now you were in the same meeting I was, right?  Yes.  Did you look around that room?  Yes.  How could it possibly be enjoyable to sit in that room?  Well, what are you saying, Scott?  My goodness.  I know half the people are asleep, the other half don't want to be there.  The weekend guys are like, what the heck am I doing here on a Thursday?  You guys are like, I got to come in early. 
[16:00]
 The morning guys want to go home.  So we're in agreement.  I could be in 30 other places.  But tell me a better way to get what you want from shift after shift after shift.  Memos.  Memos.  But nobody follows the damn memos.  Look, I got the memos right in front of me.  We love the memos.  See, when we get a memo, we can read it at our leisure and then do whatever it says or  roll it up in a ball and throw it.  Yeah, but that leaves too much room for interpretation.  Everybody interprets it differently and you do 12 different things. 
[16:30]
 And just doesn't have the attention to it.  Maybe it's my own problem because in school with the films I could never, I was on the  desk.  It's the same feeling.  The talking starts and I'm in another land.  I drift away somewhere.  You actually fell asleep twice today.  I know.  I nodded off.  You noticed that?  My head went down.  I was like, oh, jeez.  And then I look up and I'm wiping drool.  I saw what you did too.  First of all, you came in, you were almost the last one there.  Yeah, yeah. 
[17:00]
 It's on time though.  Yeah, except for your producer who was the last one there.  Yeah, that's true.  And then you try to hide behind Ralph.  Yeah, yeah.  Then I slid the chair behind Ralph.  Well, you've got to do that so you don't have to worry about the eye contact.  Well, that's it.  After a while you hide behind a fellow coworker.  You're like a running back behind the offensive guard trying to hide behind Ralph.  Yes.  You know, Anthony, when Scott was giving that pep speech, how did it sound to you?  At first it was, you know, because I thought I was listening to Vince Lombardi myself.  Yes.  Now what were you hearing in your brain at that point?  Well, at first I heard your voice and I heard it was very inspirational, very wonderful. 
[17:30]
 But then it turned into like, wah wah wah wah wah, wah wah wah wah wah.  Like Charlie Brown, you know, like the principal.  Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.  Wah wah wah wah wah wah.  I was just all, well.  That was when I was complimenting you.  So you never heard that part.  I didn't.  See, I didn't hear that part.  I don't know.  I've got to do something.  Maybe crank, maybe some crack.  So let me get this straight.  I stay at my office all day long.  Yeah.  Taking all the complaint calls about what you do. 
[18:00]
 And then we call a meeting once every how often?  When was the last meeting we had?  At least two months ago.  Okay.  We call a meeting once every two months.  Yeah.  Which is asking why.  Well, now you're putting it in that kind of perspective.  If you're a New York City police officer, you meet like before every shift.  Sure.  Well, you're talking about radio guys though.  Right.  If we wanted a real job, we would have went and found one.  So once every two months we call a meeting.  Yeah. 
[18:30]
 And then everybody pitches.  You know, perk them up a little bit, the meetings.  Bring in a stripper.  I don't know.  We don't, we go in, yeah.  Maybe a couple strippers maybe.  A dancer or something.  Or a keg.  Yeah.  What about a keg?  That's early too.  Beer ball?  Why do they have to be early?  Now you're going to get in trouble.  I know.  Because our listeners get up at like five.  I know, I know.  When Ann says the meeting's early, I'm up much too late.  The meeting today was at 11 o'clock.  Everything is relative to your employment time. 
[19:00]
 You're going to be pissing off our listeners now.  I go to the comedy thing last night.  Yeah.  Right?  Which ends at like 12.15.  Right.  I get home at like 1.15.  Mm-hmm.  The one goes off at five.  So I was here, I had the meeting at 6.30 this morning.  I was here.  And he could do that.  He could do the next one at 6.30.  No, no.  That's...  It hasn't cut into your business schedule.  Do you have meetings at Wins too?  Now he sounds like my father.  Do you do that?  Do they have meetings up there?  They've been on the other 34 years. 
[19:30]
 What could possibly talk about?  Now we want you to get news.  Instead of sports at 15 and 45, let's do it at 6.30.  14 and 45.  Let's do it at 14 and 45.  Well, that's pretty much what we heard today with these sweepers.  All right.  We will be a little more accepting of the meetings.  You have to take them with the spirit that they're intended.  Not everybody does everything exactly like you two, perfectly. 
[20:00]
 No one likes those meetings, huh?  No one likes...  Including me.  So then why don't we do that?  So let's not have...  Just memos.  Yeah, memos.  Because everybody complains about the communication process.  But we come into your office and visit you.  Yeah, see?  That's what has to be done.  You send a memo to everyone that says, hey, come up and say hi sometime.  Then we come up, we sit, and it's a lot more loose than a stuffy meeting.  Come directly to the principal's office.  Right.  With his baseball bats on the wall. 
[20:30]
 No, I don't know.  All right.  Well, you guys, you're the bosses, so if you say meeting, we have meeting.  Fine.  You hurt my feelings, but that's okay.  It's nothing personal.  Strictly business.  No, it's nothing personal.  It's not you.  I wouldn't enjoy a meeting with anybody.  With the president?  Well, not with anybody.  Yeah.  All right.  A couple of people I could think of, I didn't enjoy a meeting.  Oh, who's that?  I don't know.  Lovely young ladies.  I don't know.  Oh, the beer's here?  Where's our beer?  Whew.  Was that your idea, free beer Thursday? 
[21:00]
 No, that was Gary's.  Were you a little scared about that?  A little bit.  Yeah.  Are you really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it is a little.  It's a crazy idea, isn't it?  It's like the match in gunpowder.  Well, no.  We'll know tonight about six o'clock if it's a bit.  I have a feeling this is going to last two weeks, and that's it.  Two?  You're giving it to Earl.  He's giving it one week.  He's giving it today, but the beer is here.  Why didn't he make like free beer Thursday start at like 530 when, you know, work closes?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Got a cold.  Got a chill.  No, it's got a chill.  It's got a chill.  It's got a chill.  It's got a chill.  It's got a chill.  It's got a chill.  No, it's got a chill.  You're chilling the beer? 
[21:30]
 Ralph's all excited.  Ralph, you get your beer yet?  No, not yet.  Not yet?  It's beer Thursday.  Isn't that crazy?  I love this.  Now, Ralph's been in the business, I don't know, 80 years by now.  Oh my God.  Give or take a score.  Okay.  You've been around the block a few times.  Yeah.  Have you ever heard of something so zany as free beer Thursday for the employees?  Not on a weekly basis, no.  I've heard that.  I've heard that.  I've heard that.  I've heard that.  I've heard that.  I've heard that.  I've heard that.  I've heard that.  I've heard that.  I've heard that.  Not on a weekly basis, no.  No, I know.  Maybe once every once in a while, right?  Yeah. 
[22:00]
 You know, get together, hang, bond.  Yeah.  But this is going to be ...  It's a communication thing.  Well, technically it's not weekly until it makes it to next Thursday.  Yeah.  It is a one-time thing.  I have a feeling Scott's going to put the kvashes on this one.  Are you going to join us at least for this free beer Thursday?  I haven't decided yet.  Come on.  You've got to crack the first beer.  We got you a 40.  It is a little out there.  We got you some old English, a 40.  You can go upstairs and you can brown paper bag it. 
[22:30]
 All right.  All right.  Well, have fun.  Enjoy your beer.  We're on the air so we can't partake in the free beer Thursday.  No, of course we would never think of doing something like that.  Scott, please don't take it personally.  I enjoy your company.  I enjoy the company of many people here at NEW.  But in the meeting atmosphere ...  I'm going to kiss you in the ear.  I am not.  In the meeting atmosphere, something is taken away.  I don't think we can experience the joy of each other's company properly in a meeting.  All right.  Next time we'll just all hold hands and we'll try to reach somebody else from the past. 
[23:00]
 Yeah, say us.  Even that would be good.  Just pass out Ouija boards and we can sit at the big table and do like Ouija boards.  We'll get the spirit of Scott Muny.  Hey, he's still alive.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't know that.  That's cold.  Well, have you heard his new show?  I mean, come on.  I was in a meeting.  Yeah, that's Scott Muny-Ciesta.  Great idea those guys came up with.  All right, kicking our ass. 
[23:30]
 No, they're not.  Oh, you kidding.  All right, let's take another break.  All right, man.  We've got to thank Scott Herman for this.  Thank you, Scott.  All right, guys.  Please don't take it personally.  I'm scared to hit the commercials because then he's really going to let us.  Yeah, as long as the mics are on, we're safe.  All right, what the hell?  Let's play a few tunes here.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, the Black Crows.  And only a fool off their latest CD by your side.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, getting really into our show now.  Yeah, we're settled in. 
[24:00]
 We're ready to rock and roll.  If you got something for the show, 212-757-1027.  Let's see what's going on on the phones.  Yo, buddy.  Hey, what's up?  What do you got, man?  Listen, this guy's over at K-Rock.  They're biting off you.  What are they doing now?  Remember that contest you had when it goes back in August or September?  About the worst job in the city.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, the guy's going to take us right now to the same person.  What? 
[24:30]
 He's doing our bit?  He's doing your bit.  You know where we found Mendy?  Big Black Mendy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right now, the worst way they can find those is a guy that cleans the grease traps.  Ho, ho.  That's great.  What?  This is awful.  So they're looking for the person with the worst job in New York.  Yeah.  Something we did four months ago.  Yeah, you know.  Oh, well.  That's great radio.  You know, you've got to help these guys out.  You've got to give them some material.  Yeah.  Yeah, K-Rock needs the help.  Well, they do the rest of the day.  They've got mornings taken care of, but after that ...  Howard Stern all morning, a one share the rest of the day. 
[25:00]
 You guys are great.  That is so true.  Yeah, I don't know.  I've punched over there.  I don't know what's going on sometimes.  Well, I like the gay couple that does the night show.  What is that about?  The ambiguously gay DJ.  There's something going on there. 
[25:30]
 I don't know what it is.  There's a definite gay homo thing happening there.  Oh, of course, not that there's anything wrong with that.  Alter ...  Oh, you're into it.  There's a day where we tuned over there and Alter Queer, whatever his name is, he's asking  the other, the bigger homo, he goes, hey, can I have a hug?  Yeah, I don't know what's going on.  Can you imagine if I just opened up the mic and said, hey, can I have a hug?  Yeah, it just seems like one guy and then his little buddy.  And he's just laughing at everything. 
[26:00]
 The guy like chuckles at all his stuff.  Yeah, like he's his little ... there's some kind of dominance and submissive thing going  on with that.  That's the most fascinating aspect of their little program.  I think the two of them are just faking.  Yeah, you're just waiting for them to like orally take care of each other.  That's why I tune in.  There's the one guy who is like the Batman character and the other one like the Robin,  sort of effeminate.  And I don't know, the little banter, I don't know.  Who am I to say? 
[26:30]
 We like to come on the air and we're just two guys.  I don't understand.  Two drinking buddies, not two butt buddies.  I don't understand what that is.  That's the big difference with us and other little team shows in this town.  The ambiguously gay DJs.  And their style is just great over there after Howard.  Do we have a good loud song?  We could do a little demonstration.  All right, Anthony, do it.  This is exactly what you hear if you hear them broadcasting from a venue. 
[27:00]
 Ready?  You got an appropriate song?  Well, pretty much.  I'm going to turn the black crow out so this will have to do.  Okay.  Make sure it's real loud.  All right, you do it, Ant.  Ready?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Here we go.  Hey, how you doing?  I'll be getting away, guys.  Take it.  Later on.  Watch out.  There I go.  It's like you can't even hear them.  It's just loud and obnoxious.  They've got that attitude. 
[27:30]
 All right, try it again, Anthony.  I don't know if you're doing a good enough job with that.  I have to do the alterqueer voice.  Okay.  Hey, what are you doing?  Hey, Ron.  I'm glad to see you turned it down.  That's a bad thing.  It's got to be so loud you can barely hear the DJ talk.  All right, go ahead.  Try it again.  Hey, alterqueer.  Yeah. 
[28:00]
 Can I have a hug?  Thank you.  How's the video?  Good video.  I don't know.  It's better than nothing.  I'll try that again.  I don't know what this is all about.  We're getting away, Jack.  Sarah.  It didn't sound swishy enough.  No.  I don't know what's going on over there.  I don't know what their relationship is, but it just seems a little bizarre to me.  Yeah, tomorrow they're going to do something on the spank, I think.  Yeah, all right.  Well, call up the, like, I don't even know who does the spank.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[28:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  We're off to a fine start today.  What a mess of a show.  We can't get to anything.  We keep getting sidetracked. 
[29:00]
 It's just going to get uglier and uglier today.  Of course it is.  All right.  We'll do some Van Halen.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  On the way we got Everlast, Pink Floyd next by request.  And if you want to get a hold of us, easiest way is through the facts line, 212-957-WNEW.  And well, I guess we finally should talk about the interview, Anthony.  Oh, thank you.  I'm going to go ahead and get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started. 
[29:30]
 I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  I'm going to get started.  Okay.  I wouldn't label myself a chubby chaser.  Right.  By any means.  I was completely, completely turned on by Monica Lewinsky last night.  Completely.  A bold statement.  I know a lot of people, it's easy to make the fact jokes and she looked like a cow and 
[30:00]
 yeah, her belly was pretty big and stuff.  There was something going on with Monica Lewinsky last night and I was completely turned on.  You got to give her some facial looks.  They weren't bad.  You know, they made her up.  Yeah.  You know, a professional makeup guy comes in and does all that.  But I'll tell you something, the mouth, beautiful.  What a mouth on this girl. 
[30:30]
 A perfect mouth.  For what she uses it for.  But the teeth, nice, straight, white.  Perfect.  Yeah.  And beautiful lips.  Yes.  And her mouth was always lubed.  Did you see?  As she's talking, at no time was she having any dry mouth problems.  Her tongue, over her teeth, it looked like it had a fine little coating of Vaseline over 
[31:00]
 everything.  Everything.  Didn't get those spit strings.  Nothing like that.  No cotton mouth.  Nothing.  And as she talked, the inside of her mouth glistened.  Just glistened.  What a beautiful mouth.  I have no idea what she said last night.  For two hours I'm just like wow.  You notice how they blocked the shot.  Her mouth was the middle of the screen.  The middle of the screen.  So your eyes were constantly looking at those lips moving. 
[31:30]
 And when she'd kind of, you know, ha ha ha, give that big laugh or a mouth open wide,  she would just, oh, look at that.  It's like a water slide.  It's so wet and moist and inviting and fun like a water slide.  I couldn't get over it.  Were you turned on?  I got to tell you, the face shot, yeah.  But then they showed some of the old footage of her getting out of the car with her lawyer.  And at one point you just see that butt.  That big old ass.  Ooh, where's her song? 
[32:00]
 Yeah, you see that big ass of hers and it just kind of turned me off a little.  I'm not the chubby chasin type.  But with her hair pulled back and the makeup.  Definitely cute.  And the nice, lubed mouth.  I was really turned on last night.  So lubed.  Yeah.  And her teeth.  Oof.  The widest teeth I've ever come across.  I tell you.  That old gag.  Why?  I've cut.  As you live you come across a lot of teeth in life.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't understand what you're getting at. 
[32:30]
 But she had a lot of makeup on though.  At one point when she was crying you saw the river.  I couldn't cut through the makeup like the river cuts through the Grand Canyon.  I couldn't watch that part open.  No.  I was tearing up myself watching Monica get so upset.  Hi, NW.  How you doing?  Hey, what's up, Jeff?  Oh, not a whole lot.  I can't believe the way Anthony's going on about Monica like that.  Just her mouth, my friend.  Oh, yeah, I know.  But come on.  Did you see it?  A little too long there.  I mean, she's really hurting. 
[33:00]
 But did you see her mouth?  Yeah, I saw her mouth.  That was her mouth.  I don't know what crap that was coming out of it.  It was a pleasure organ, that mouth.  Come on, man.  It was glistening.  Glistening.  I can't say that she's a pig anymore.  I was turned on by Monica's face last night.  It was constantly moist, moving.  She had the whole lip moving thing going.  Yes, it's an ascent, I admit.  But you can't, I mean, I don't know.  She just turns me off.  All right.  Well, I thought she was articulate.  I thought she had charisma, a little bit of a sense of humor, a little bit of a naughty 
[33:30]
 girl.  She was happy.  She was a dirty girl.  She had some youth behind her.  I think you're great.  I think your taste is better than this, though.  I was turned on.  Don't give us so much credit.  Yeah, I'm not going to sit here and do all the fat jokes like everyone else is doing  today.  I am admitting on this show that I was turned on by Monica last night.  How can I tell you?  All right, well, maybe it was a lonely night for you.  I'm not sure, but she's just hurting.  Well, me, I kind of liked Barbara. 
[34:00]
 She was looking hot.  You go for those naughty older girls.  I tell you, the age is just a bitch, man, because they would go.  Obviously, they're the only two people in the room.  Yeah.  And they're panning from Monica, who with the makeup on and stuff, beautiful skin, she  looked nice, her eye makeup was there.  And then they'd go to Barbara and it's just like, oh, the crypt keeper.  Because you're getting that constant back and forth contrast of young and old.  And it really made Barbara look ten times worse than she probably really does. 
[34:30]
 Yes, I guess, yeah.  And maybe that's why Monica looked better.  Right.  I think, yeah, hey, oh, there you go.  Maybe it was the contrast.  And next to the pictures of Linda Tripp they were showing.  Come on.  It's a no-brainer.  You got a beast.  You're in a bar.  It's five minutes before closing time.  You got Monica, Barbara Walters, or Linda Tripp.  Who are you going for?  I might take the bartender.  The bartender.  All right, man.  Yeah, that was a little much that Linda Tripp. 
[35:00]
 Yeah, maybe.  Maybe.  Did you see they picked the worst, not that I'm saying they were a really good one, but  the worst possible clips of Linda Tripp with the big goofy hair and the witch nose.  Well, what I was thinking was the sea hag.  Yeah.  Linda Tripp looks like the sea hag.  And look at Monica.  Monica looks like a wimpy. 
[35:30]
 Big fat ass.  Hey, you guys keep up the good work.  All right, Jeff, thanks a lot.  I bet she's got one kushky-pusky.  Michelle, what do you got?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I tell you, I was watching it last night and my husband was like, oh, wow.  Hold on a minute, Michelle.  Oh, wait, I had a bleed bill.  I'm sorry.  Wait a minute.  Now start over.  You've got to talk like you're a woman.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Watch this.  I was watching it.  My husband comes in and he's just looking at her and he doesn't find her too attractive, 
[36:00]
 but he goes, they got her mouth right in the middle of the screen.  Right.  They just keep showing it.  Right.  You know, she had the president's.  Wait, wait, wait.  She had the president's.  I'll leave that ass in her mouth.  Thank you.  You don't need to say it.  I think everyone knows.  Yeah, I think everyone was thinking that as you're watching the interview.  Yeah, it really was unbelievable.  You know, you're just picturing, Hey, baby.  No, she just likes to do it.  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with that.  She's a young girl and everyone's looking at Monica like she wrecked the first family 
[36:30]
 and stuff.  Please.  The president had all that power.  He's 51 years old.  She's 22, naive and sguar.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  Stop with the cursing.  Whose mouth is worse, yours or Monica's?  My God.  You are a little dirty mouth.  I'm sorry.  All right, Michelle.  Oh, oh, oh.  All right, Michelle, I gotta let you go because we've run out of the phone.  We can't hear.  We've run out of the light. 
[37:00]
 We got to let you go.  We can't take a chance.  Yeah.  All right, Michelle.  All right.  I'll just nice talking to you.  Definitely.  Oh my God.  How many curses she let fly there.  God.  What is with her?  Mike.  Mike.  Yeah.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Be careful.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no, no.  I'm waiting for the delay to build up so we don't have much leeway here.  So if you're going to say anything stupid and dirty, talking code. 
[37:30]
 Well, I'll put it to you like that.  All right, go.  She was going to release some big secret secret last night, right?  Yeah.  So what figure, what could it be?  My thing was maybe she'll tell you exactly where on the dress the stain was.  Right.  Was it on the lapel?  Was it on the inside of the front?  Yeah.  Inside of the back?  Right.  I mean, that would have been something to reveal.  Inside of the back.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I get a little perspective as to where this relationship really was. 
[38:00]
 It was a fluff interview.  It was boring as hell.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I was hoping something like that.  Yeah.  When she's talking about flipping the dress up and showing her G-string to the president,  Oh, man.  You just picture that big white, fish-bellied white ass.  Oh, man, right?  Bill Clinton looking at it, you know, like playing like a 19th century photographer with  a dress, popping the cloth over his head, hey, baby.  Yeah.  So what's the thought in his mind?  He's like, you know what? 
[38:30]
 I'm in the office all alone.  I got her or Betty out in the lobby.  Yeah.  Yeah, Betty Curry.  Let's take the luxury to two evils here.  All right, man.  Well, thanks for participating, Mike.  All right.  All right.  Pleased.  Yeah, but I don't think she really takes it seriously to this point.  I don't think so.  She was laughing, giggling.  She seemed like she still likes talking about it, like there's still that little element  of adventure.  Of course.  And she's somebody because of this whole thing.  That's fine. 
[39:00]
 Who cares?  And she's chuckling.  I don't know.  I kind of found it a little less.  I thought she should have been a little more sorry.  Now, of course, Anthony, we wanted someone else to interview Monica.  Yes.  I think I've heard a couple of these from yesterday.  They were a big hit.  Instead of Barbara Walters interviewing Monica last night, we wanted someone like, I don't  know, William Shatner to interview Monica.  And it would have sounded something like this.  I want to like that.  Monica, you're a beautiful woman, so full and sensuous.  I'm wondering, is your oral technique more like that of the oneself creatures of the 
[39:30]
 that latch on to their prey, sucking and sucking till their lifelessen live?  Or more like the salt-sucking monsters of Camus II?  Answer.  You've got an ass like Uhura, and your mouth looks like the Doomsday Machine that destroyed  the USS Constellation and killed Commodore Decker.  Big and inviting.  Did her mouth look like the Doomsday Machine, I hope? 
[40:00]
 Well, that's what William Shatner said.  It was big and inviting.  Sure.  That's for sure.  Or another one that everyone enjoyed.  Instead of Barbara Walters interviewing Monica, it would have been much more exciting to hear  Howard Stern.  Sure, sure.  There are a lot of interviews these days.  Interview Monica.  Now what would that sound like, Anthony?  Hey honey, look at you, huh?  I would do you.  So you're going to go Lesbo.  Yeah, I can picture that, can't you, Robin?  Right, Jackie?  Lesbo's got a little bit of a big mouth.  I'm going to go Lesbo.  I'm going to go Lesbo.  I'm going to go Lesbo.  I'm going to go Lesbo. 
[40:30]
 I'm going to go Lesbo.  I'm going to go Lesbo.  I'm going to go Lesbo.  I'm going to go Lesbo.  I'm going to go Lesbo.  Ooh, Lesbo sex.  Ooh, yeah.  Hey, you're hot.  Hey, your ass is a little big, but I like that.  Ooh.  Hey, take off that top, honey.  Let's see those cans.  Ooh.  I'd watch that, of course.  It would have been more entertaining than Barbara, and of course the one everyone is  talking about today.  We got probably a hundred emails on this overnight.  Instead of Barbara Walters and Monica Lewinsky, it would have been so much cooler if Dice did  it.  Yes. 
[41:00]
 welcome this whale to my show huh? And you know you're a whale cuz I could see  your blowhole. Yay! So you're sucking Clinton's **** right? Does he blow his **** on that  chubby face of yours or does he pull out and **** all over your big **** huh? Come on  answer the question. Answer the question you whore. Answer the question. Oh look  now she's gonna cry. Get up Barbara Walters you're gonna cry huh?  You'll look at her little back. Answer the question. Watch your mouth full you 
[41:30]
 ****ing whore. Look at his **** back huh? I don't want you on my ****ing show. Get the **** out of here you ****ing whore.  You've had a hundred and twenty million people watching that one. Instead of sixty five sure.  One oh two seven WNEW the Rock of New York Everlast. What it's like Pink Floyd  before that you're hanging with Opien Anthony. Hey I just burped up some of my 
[42:00]
 Thai lunch. Speaking of which. Burp on the air. Well. Stealing Howard's ****. Sorry.  That's right. Don't want to piss off Howard. My god. Alright anyway. I gotta  call you out on something though. I don't like when you do this. Why? Without  consulting me before the break. Hey the show's about honesty. We try to keep it  real here. Don't do fake little goofy fun little breaks where we make believe it was 
[42:30]
 spontaneous and stuff and it's actually written down. We don't do that. We turn on  the mics and let it go. What's your problem? Well we're sitting down eating some Thai  food. Which by the way that was some good stuff wasn't it? Very good. And we had an  Asian. What are they called? Like a Taiwanese waiter? A Thai waiter. A Thai  waiter? Thai. They're just Thai's. Yeah. Alright. And what do you say about how  Asian people talk? What? I pick up the menu and I started reading it. Right. I 
[43:00]
 just I just point at the menu. Because because well there was one dish that had  like a King Pow and then a WEE. King Pow-ee. Like or WAA. Like they need two  A's in the middle to get that whole WAA thing going. Yeah. Like you can't just be  a you know WEEELK. It's gotta be WEEE. So what do you say? You say. I don't know what 
[43:30]
 you're talking about. Did you say every Asian person sounds like this or just that particular  gentleman that was helping us today? I believe it was just that particular gentleman that  was helping us today. So he. This might not be indicative of all Asian gentlemen.  1027 WNEW. The Rock of New York. Metallica. Turn the page. It's Opie. It's Anthony. And it's our  pal Ralph the Tour hanging in the studio. You stayed late today because it's free 
[44:00]
 beer Thursday. A new concept that the boss came up with today. I love this. It's a  great idea right? A little insane I think. So everyone. Why not? Everyone's drinking  and we're kind of technically not allowed to drink because we're on the air. You guys can't.  We're on the air. Yeah we haven't done that before. I'm waiting for Heroin Monday. That's what I'm  waiting for. I want Crank Wednesday. Yeah. When's Gary gonna instate Crystal Meth Tuesday? It's a  great idea but honestly it's not gonna last. No. We got two of these. Why? We'll be able to drink 
[44:30]
 this Thursday and we'll be able to drink next Thursday and then the foot is coming down. Yeah.  Definitely. I think it's a good idea. This doesn't seem very corporate. No, no. Not at all. I can't  see that. Hey this will take off. It's sort of like that dress down Friday thing we do. We all  just drink. It frees up the thought processes though. Well it does. But what other office in New  York is doing this where they have free beer Thursday for all their employees? We're trendsetters.  And we're bitching complain about our jobs. We have the easiest job in America. Oh I know. Believe me. We 
[45:00]
 know that now. I love my job. We're getting... I worked for a living Opie. You don't have to tell me  Mr. Caddy. I don't think you are a good judge of how easy this job is. I never did anything. I think  I'm a better judge at how easy this job is. I was a computer programmer for Xerox for a few years.  Wait wait wait. Computer programming back in the early 80s. What was that Pong? It was pretty much. 
[45:30]
 It was yeah. You're right. Wow there's tens of lines of code in this. You're right. You want to  know my work history? Yeah. Let me hear your little resume. Okay I started I don't know when  I was like ten delivering Penny Savers with my mom okay. Then I graduated to get my own paper out.  Okay wow. Then I was a caddy for 12 years at the Huntington Crescent Club in Huntington. What's up  boys? All right. Boy on the bench for 12 years. Caddy. Oh that's rough. Were you thinking about making a 
[46:00]
 profession? Well from 14 to 26. It was a great college gig too. Boy that must have been rough  in the winters and the snow. Oh that's right. They don't golf in the winter. I got to come to Opie's defense  here. Okay. I was a caddy as well. It's not. What is this like a radio thing? Well no. Anthony did  you double bag? Double bag? Double bag's a bitch. Double loops twice a day. Come on. Anthony trust me.  Trust me. And those guys always cheat and try and put extra clubs in there and stuff. They have rules. 
[46:30]
 They're all supposed to have. And Anthony they yelled at you. They would throw their club and you had to  go chase in the woods and if you didn't you lost your money. There was our own little hell involved.  At least you were in a private club right? It was private. See I caddyed to Beth Page when they had  caddies as a public course. Well that's nasty. At least these guys knew what they were doing. The cards were so old the  recommended tip was 350. Some of them stuck to it for six hours work. Yeah it was brutal. You tell Ty Web I'm 
[47:00]
 gunning for him if he's half as good as he says he is he's gonna have to play me to prove it. Oh Anthony  that was like when that movie came out forget about it. It was great. We saw that movie about 20  times when we were looping. So then I was a caddy then I started my little radio career when I was 18.  Did that. See you never you put your caddy. It's almost done then I went to Xerox for like a year and a half.  Computer program. And then after college after I had my degree I hung out in the town for another year and I worked at a video store. 
[47:30]
 During the day this is a true story. Very strenuous. During the day I would hang out all my fraternity  brothers would come in and just take movies off the shelves. I couldn't ask them to pay for them. I saw  clerks and how. All right and we would watch and this is the truth we'd watch pornos all day long and  then like a mom would come in with their kid to pick out a movie and I would be pissed because I'd have to  turn off the porno. This poor guy made no money I got fired from that and I think that was it. 
[48:00]
 I'm sorry I can't I can't sympathize. You know I don't think you have really honestly worked hard at manual labor  where you are are busting your hump in all types of weather on rooftops using machinery using heavy tools.  Aside from the caddying he's got you. Oh even the caddying. I'll be the first to admit that Anthony had 
[48:30]
 much more. First of all it's got to be beautiful weather for you to caddy. No we we caddy in the rain and and in the snow.  I don't think that Heist stuff is going to come down for quite some time. Exactly and I'll give it to you. I know you  worked your ass off twice as hard as me. No doubt about it I'm not going to argue that point. Thank you. I just  want the appreciation that I so deserve. Damn it is that too much to ask for. I was going to hear Anthony's  resume. I was lucky. Oh everyone knows that. I heard your resume. Anthony's resume is pretty much hard labor from the  crawling. He was eight to thirty. Crawling through it. Twenty by twenty ducked in a hospital a ventilation duct with 
[49:00]
 with chia pets growing on the inside of tuberculosis. And they tell you you just had to go. Anthony you get get your  saws all. Get in that duct. You're going to have to cut a twenty by twenty hole in the wall and it's uh it's venting the  TB ward. All right great. You know I put a tissue over my mouth or something. You don't need that. What are you a fag? 
[49:30]
 No I'll go. Yeah it was hell. Well tell them about the spackle buckets. I learned a lot from Anthony. Well on the on the  job sites a lot of times when we were in there installing the HVAC duct work. The bathrooms weren't in yet. No sticks  two by fours. So the bathroom facilities weren't there. They had some portable toilets sometimes but you wouldn't even go  near them. Never mind in them. And some of the trades some of the newbies would go in them and you'd run out with duct tape and duct tape  the door shut and then start rocking it. And the kids crying and they're. Stop. He's just seeing this sloshing mess thinking of what it'll be like 
[50:00]
 if it tips over. This happens. This is job sites. That was in a movie wasn't it? Well what about happens every day. All the time.  The spackle buckets. So that's the best part. Yeah a lot of guys would go in the empty spackle buckets. You know that are laying around  a lot of job sites. Yeah. And which is enough. You know you get that you talk about butt ring. You know that that that  ingrained in your your butt. But then you just you put the lid on and put it somewhere. 
[50:30]
 So there was always a running rule. You never open the closed spackle bucket. Oh man. But then you get some people like hey you know I  could use this for my tools. OK newbie. Yeah you open that spackle bucket. Yeah. They open the top and like.  Something in here. Just grab it. Yeah. Yeah. Always. And the other part about Anthony's prior life you guys used to blame each other when  you break stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Well you have to. You didn't really want to. Take the blame for anything. You break a brand new bathtub in a job site 
[51:00]
 and it's all. I was doing a job once it was this retirement home and the bathroom is done all perfect. Nice. All I had to do was put a little eight by eight  grill over the bathtub little ventilation grill. So I get my ladder and I make sure I put little paper down so it doesn't scratch the inside of the tub.  And I go up with my Makita drill and I have the Phillips head attachment on the thing and I go to screw it in. I drop the drill I watch in slow motion as it spins. 
[51:30]
 It hits perfect right on the Phillips head and goes sticks in the back making a hole in the tub. So what do I do go to the super and say hey excuse me I  seem to have made a mistake and I drop the drill in the back. No. Took a piece of cardboard throw it over the hole leave and took the grill down. I was never in there.  I seem to miss that one with the grill. I didn't do I didn't do one twelve. I got that one hole in the tub. What crap in the spackle bucket. What 
[52:00]
 this guy says he has an easier job than we do. Really. Peter what do you got. Yeah I was just listening to you guys. I want to tell you I have an easier job than you do.  I would do. I work as a personal trainer. I work only four days a week. Four hours a day. Get paid seventy five bucks each hour to watch fat ladies work out in the  home. The easiest scam in the world. All you got to do is get certified get a bunch of clients and there you go. So you go to the fat lady's house. Yep. 
[52:30]
 Train them at home. It's the easiest way to make the most money. Go right to that house. You know I hate to say this but put that chubby little box on a treadmill. Really.  Yeah. Tell them do a few crunches. There you go. And what is it. Do you just know it's a lost cause of some of these people. You look at him and it's like they're never going to do anything.  And it's kind of the only thing that's frustrating is that you know some of them are never going to change. You know you know as soon as you leave the twenty to go to the mouth. You know that 
[53:00]
 I'm sitting there watching general hospital all day eating bonbons and you know no matter how many crunches they do that still look like fat pigs. Now Peter I got to ask you. Yeah. Have you ever flopped one of them.  There may not be a 401k plan but they are a benefit. You know. Oh well. You flopped some of these ladies. Oh.  Oh.  I'm not a Christmas guy. You get a nice pet you know. Oh. Work them out on the treadmill. So what. So what's the move usually. Didn't I have a routine about that. Yeah. 
[53:30]
 What what's your role in the. All right. All right. Wait I want to know what the move is. What's the move when you're thinking of flopping one of them.  Usually it kind of just happens. I bet it's their move. It is. It's their move and it's easier than taking candy from a baby.  What are you a muscle guy. Right. You got it. You know I believe it or not. I'm not a huge guy. I'm not a really big guy. But you know you're probably defined in a lot of the women that are your clients probably look at you and they're all. 
[54:00]
 I haven't seen that for a while. Yeah. Yeah. And you know you see the husband and you see why that family is the money they do.  Oh. You might have an easier job. Yeah. I have an easy job guys. But you know you guys have a great job too. I just want to share with you. Yeah. But you're like banging like Linda Tripp lookalike.  Come on. We get to look at like. Oh. Human or a crotch child. We get to look at you know like you know women like Tara. Yeah. You get Linda. All right man. All right. 
[54:30]
 You guys. Thanks. That's pretty good job. Very good. Yeah. We got to take a quick break. I'm not. Is it true Reverend Al Sharpton's call us today is is that what I'm hearing. Yeah. He was he was arrested yesterday. Yeah.  Tragic. And yeah I think he's going to call from Rikers from Rikers. Yeah. Wow. Why not. It's another exclusive for us.  The Rock of New York one oh two seven W.A.W. the latest from Collective Soul that's heavy off their CD dosage Collective Soul coming to town March 29th and 30th 30th. 
[55:00]
 Wow. I almost sound like Mad Dog for a minute there.  I can't believe it. That's very nice and very.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  I got a. What a fabulous car.  A Bowery ballroom for Collective Soul on the 29th and 30th of March tickets on sale now. 
[55:30]
 Slur my words and I'm not even participating in free beer Thursday with the rest of the staff here at any W.A.W.  You must have a contact buzz on the beers. Everyone else is drinking here on beer Thursday.  Here's what is wrong with this place. No wonder we're like at the bottom of the ratings pile.  This is the ideas we come up with. Let's celebrate our horrible ratings by having free beer Thursday.  Maybe we can't do any worse drunk. 
[56:00]
 Should be a part of the motto. My Lord. All right.  I need some stimuli so I went with the espresso. That's why I'm for my behavior. Wow.  Yeah. Mocha espresso. Wow. All right. Anyway.  Yeah. Where's Ralph? Yeah. Ralph has the sable playboy. We want to look through that with Ralphie Casey masterpiece.  Barbecue. Lace potato chips. Fork goes over. Those things rock.  Anthony. A lot of people commenting about the interview last night. We don't want to, you know, harp on it too long today. 
[56:30]
 But people are coming up with some very interesting comments.  Dan and Queens through the instant feedback. Did anyone else notice how stiff her hair was? Yeah.  Like it was just plastered to the to our head. Hmm.  Well, Dan sums it up because I was looking at her hair and all I kept thinking of was that scene from there something about Mary.  A lot of people came up with that. It's true. Yeah.  And she had professional makeup. People do her all up. Yeah. That's why she kind of looked pretty good. 
[57:00]
 Pretty good. And I think this is the best instant feedback of the day thus far. Andrew from Glen Cove.  I agree with you about Monica's mouth. Yeah. We went off on how how well lubed it was the whole interview and we couldn't get past that.  She had no cotton mouth and it was just glistening the whole interview. Every time she talked from back to front, her tongue or teeth or gums glistening, glistening like she gargled with Vaseline.  She didn't have this. She didn't have the spit strings on the side of her mouth when she was talking or that little white spit that goes on the corner of the mouth sometimes when you talk to somebody. 
[57:30]
 You ever had to talk to somebody after they just smoked weed and it's like they got that thing going, hey man, what's up?  Is that just like, oh God, dude, drink something. Hey, that was that was pretty good.  That's some good weed, man.  Got any more of that? 
[58:00]
 That's the truth. All right. So Andrew from Glen Cove, he agrees with us about Monica's mouth.  But my girlfriend pointed out that if she was getting wet on her dress, she can't be that good because she didn't finish.  I should point out that my girlfriend is no slouch in the Home Department.  She just got out of the hospital after four days from a car accident.  And the first thing she did when we got home was planted my butt on the couch and got out the proverbial knee pads.  Oh, my God. She gave me a hummer right there still wearing the cervical collar for her injured neck. 
[58:30]
 That's a scene. Is that a trooper or what?  If you ever start a Hummer Hall of Fame, I'd like to nominate her.  So thank you, Andrew, for participating in the radio show.  There's some heart. There's some spirit.  You can't keep her down or from going.  All right. Very good.  And we're not even the drunk ones around here.  The whole staff is in shock with what's coming out of our mouths.  And you guys are the ones that are getting hammered. 
[59:00]
 Let me know when it's safe to drink.  So it's coming through my nose.  All right. So Ralph, Ralph's got Playboy with Sable in it.  Sable in it. The issue that's not on stands for another week.  Yeah, about that. Correct.  So you got a copy. You get I know you got some friends in high places.  And while these pictures are even better, we were just seeing the pictures on the Internet.  Yeah. And would you like to look?  Yeah. Let me take a look. You've been you've been bogarting the Sable issue.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
[59:30]
 Oh, well, she's definitely had those implants.  I don't think I don't think anyone's wondering about that.  She's got the weird nippies, though.  It looks like the pop up timer when you're cooking a turkey.  Yeah. Right. It just.  OK. She shaved, though. I don't know what she's doing down there.  Well, she's got a mohawk happening down there.  Or an exclamation point.  It's a major exclamation point where it like it starts out big and then narrows out as it goes down. 
[60:00]
 You know, like the fancy cartoon exclamation point.  I'll never look at her the same way again now when she comes strutting out onto the squared circle of the WWF.  Well, she was supposed to be here in the studio with us today.  No, she is. She is. Yeah. Thanks.  And yeah, this is just as good as seeing her live.  Yeah. She wouldn't take her clothes off, though, for us, would she?  Oh, that for a fact. I don't think so.  No, she's Sable. Yeah.  Looking good. Well, Ralph, thanks for bringing this in. 
[60:30]
 I like her. My pleasure.  What? Anything for you guys.  You know, it's just guys are just we're just pigs, man.  Sable, take your clothes off.  And see Vince stripper naked.  And you got it. You got to do the famous she's naked because it's just what guys do. It's just it's so bad.  Yeah. I mean, you could be in a high profile meeting or or or ruling the freeway. 
[61:00]
 And all of a sudden a playboy breaks out and also everyone losing their concentration.  All the guys you ever see the commercial for begging strips for the dog.  Oh boy, oh boy, oh baby. It's bacon. Yeah. Yeah. Bacon, bacon, bacon.  Guys are the same way with naked with with the girls because we're just like, where's the magazine?  Where is it? Where is it? I heard you. You got it, Ralph. Where is it?  Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. She's naked.  I love naked. Give me the magazine. I can't see.  I can't see. It was supposed to warm me when I could drink. 
[61:30]
 Oh, it hurts. Isn't it true though? You're the you're like when you go to a strip joint with your friends and you know,  damn it, you have to leave. Yeah. You're nursing that ten dollar beer.  You're down to the bottom. You're looking at the time. You got to go.  You've seen 18 girls take the stage, different girls, and you're ready to leave of all varieties.  And then a girl comes out that you haven't seen yet.  Or one walks in the door with her bag, you know, like she's ready on the on deck circle.  You're like, well, I guess I got a couple of minutes. 
[62:00]
 You've seen 18 different naked girls, but you'd saw this one walk in and now you have to see her.  Sure. Why? Cause oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.  She's naked. Where is she?  Stick your gold on. Fuck your head. I can't see.  And we just get like that.  Even on the streets of New York, if you just catch a girl bending over or something,  and you get a quick peek or something, you know, 
[62:30]
 we could be having the most intelligent conversation on the on the street corner.  And a girl comes by and she's not wearing a bra and you can see the whole package.  Yeah. The guys just lose it like dogs.  That's true.  Just standing there kind of had, how'd you do yesterday?  Ah, Mark was a little down. I think I got out in time.  I called holy geez, look at the ass on her.  That's an ass, isn't it?  Just in mid-stripe and then he could just take right back up where he has.  So she's out of eyesight. 
[63:00]
 There's the two brains, the brain for everything and then the sex brain,  which can just cut in at any moment. Doesn't matter.  That's part of being a man.  All right. Sorry, ladies.  Well, I don't think they know how that is. Thanks for the, the playboy, Ralph.  They enjoy the naked thing girls like the Chippendales and stuff,  but they just don't crave it as much like they can.  Me and the girls are planning on going to Chippendales in two months.  We haven't planned. We're gone.  Guys, it's like a phone call. Hey, Billy, you want to go down to the carousel tonight? 
[63:30]
 Yeah, tonight. Oh boy.  We don't plan like two months later to do things.  They can wait. Like we can, if you plan something,  yeah, two months we're going to the strip joint. Oh great.  Why don't we go tonight?  All right. And end in two months and every day in between.  Girls, I was like, two months, we have a plan.  A little bachelor party.  Circle of date on your calendar. 
[64:00]
 Circle of date. Oh boy, I almost forgot. Tomorrow is...  Maybe we could go in the morning and at night.  All right. I got a statement for all the guys driving home right now.  It's in Playboy, the April issue with Sable on the cover.  There's an article in here, Anthony. Oh really?  I think it's self-explanatory and I think you're a homo.  Huh? You're a homo. You're a homo. You got me.  Does oral sex die at the altar? 
[64:30]
 Wow.  Well, that's the question.  How many guys are laughing in their car right now?  Yeah.  An exclusive Playboy report.  I still get it.  Yeah? Why not?  Ralph?  Oh my God, he's going to run out of here.  And throw that bottle of Labatt Blue at your head.  If Ralph's wife is listening, Ralph left the studio a long time ago.  I figured it would be funny to say, Ralph... 
[65:00]
 He's not going to say anything.  The guy that just gave me the finger is not Ralph.  He's not in here.  He's not in here drinking, looking over the pictures of Sable with us.  It's not Ralph. It's just the guy that looks a lot like him.  It's Ralph Smith.  Yeah, that's the Ralph we're talking about. Ralph Smith.  Well, Ralph got in trouble for pointing out what girl he thought was hot in the kiss issue. 
[65:30]
 Yeah.  Did you get in trouble for that?  No.  He's not talking, man.  He's not here. I'm telling you. We're just making believe he's here.  How long have you been married, Ralph?  I thought I'd get on with that one.  Is it 10 years?  A long of it?  He's turning his mic off.  How long?  18.  18 years. 
[66:00]
 18 years.  Wow. Congrats.  This June.  And everything is still as passionate as from the beginning.  Everything is wonderful.  Kathy's really cool. We love Kathy.  I know, but what's his wife's name?  But I've got to tell you, folks...  Holly, what do you got?  I was just saying, first of all, you guys are killing me with the naked thing.  That's just too funny. I got a great middle picture.  And second of all, women can plan two months in advance to go to Chippendales  because we're used to the delayed gratification thing.  Oh, that hurt. 
[66:30]
 Below the belt.  Wow, that's quick. That's good.  Well, I mean, come on.  All right, we'll let you have that one.  All right, thanks.  And the girls give us hell when we go to the strip clubs.  Like, what were you doing? Were you touching her?  First of all, there's no touching.  You sit there like a puppet putting dollar bills and G-strings,  and now it's at the point where they might as well just get an intermediary to take your money.  You know?  The little guy to take your money.  She appreciates it. She loves you. Thank you.  So you're not really... there's no contact. 
[67:00]
 I don't know what the girls get upset about.  And the Chippendales shows...  Oh, look at me! Look at me, Karen!  Look at me! Snap a picture!  Snap a picture! This is great!  This is great! I was so much fun at Chippendales!  Look at me! Katie, Katie, take a picture while I bend over!  Oh!  You know, Anthony?  What?  How do you know that?  I've heard stories. I've seen the pictures. 
[67:30]
 Take a picture!  You know, and they're going crazy.  They take the dollars and they're shoving them right down there.  Yeah. It is definitely different.  And the guys are just so interested in the ladies.  All right. When is Reverend Al Collin?  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. Another track from Eve Six.  That's Leech.  It's opiate, Anthony.  Hey.  Whee!  Hope you're having fun. We're rocking and rolling here for you. 
[68:00]
 On Free Beer Thursday.  Unbelievable.  I bet you people listening to this don't believe it.  No, it is Free Beer Thursday at NEW.  Our boss, we had another one of those really stupid boring meetings.  We had to be at work five hours early just to have a meeting.  That could have taken probably five minutes in a memo.  A memo, yeah. Could have been a memo.  But he announced at the meeting that Thursdays here at NEW will be Free Beer Thursdays, 
[68:30]
 where everyone can get together in a loose atmosphere, drink beer, and trade ideas and talk.  Yeah.  And promote alcoholism.  I don't know.  Well, honestly, this is just obviously not going to last.  We're going to enjoy it today. We're going to enjoy it next Thursday.  And I think by then it's going to be over with.  And the time slot is kind of weird because we can't enjoy it. 
[69:00]
 Right. It starts at four o'clock, so basically the entire staff of NEW kind of just writes off the last hour and a half of work.  Something that I think is a good thing to do when you're suffering so badly in the ratings,  it's good to celebrate the fact that we suck by having the staff drink together.  We should have amphetamines Friday. That way the people get all perked up to do things.  It's just amazing.  It's good. Crystal meth Tuesday. 
[69:30]
 And I bet you people think we make up after stuff. No, this is...  No, there's no making this stuff up.  This is as real as it gets.  If we made it up, it would be silly.  There's people just walking around the halls drinking beer together.  Instead of trying to figure out how to get out of the ratings dump.  Has anyone communicated any great ideas through this beer drinking ritual that has been enacted here?  Well, Ben the fag is in the studio. No, Ben.  You guys are all drinking, right?  Everybody's drinking.  Really? Is any work getting done whatsoever? 
[70:00]
 Well, I mean, you know...  I actually...  Oh, I'm calling great programming on here. Here it is.  We all drink a lot of beer every day of the week, alright?  Come on now. Our day is great.  Now what have you done since 4 o'clock? Since Free Beer Thursday started.  I went and purchased the beer with Earl.  Well, you did something. That's great.  And I got the tub at SK Mart.  Tub of ice.  I actually, when I got back after I started with my first beer, I did check my email.  And I did return a few calls. 
[70:30]
 Oh my God.  This is pathetic.  Oh my God.  Alright. Well, that's great.  Alright.  Maybe they're trying to relive... I'm trying to get an idea of where this is going.  Maybe they're trying to bring back like the glory days of N.E.W.  When Scott Muni used to have scotch every day.  Is that it?  Maybe the tie-in there? Some kind of alcohol tie-in?  Now, Earl, what's going on with Free Beer Thursday?  Is anything getting done? Is it arousing success in the back offices? 
[71:00]
 I don't drink, so I'm getting work done.  See the difference? Earl doesn't drink. He's getting work done.  Ben the Fag loves drinking and has done nothing.  There's a great commercial for alcoholism.  What?  See, who wouldn't think that drinking would promote hard work?  Is everyone smashed?  No. Not at all.  No one's out of line yet? 
[71:30]
 No. Not yet.  Not yet?  It's still early.  Alright.  It's only ten to six.  It's only ten to six. It would have been an hour.  Just wait until the big, big, big, big, big boss finds out about Free Beer Thursday.  How are the other stations at countering this?  I don't know.  Are they doing Quaalude Monday?  Weed Wednesday.  Weed Wednesday.  Alright.  Well, great. Have fun, guys, with the Free Beer and stuff. 
[72:00]
 We have Reverend Al on the phone, Anthony.  Yes, we do.  Now, what happened with Reverend Al? What's the latest news on the ref?  Well, he took some protesters yesterday to Wall Street and had a sit-in.  And of course they arrested him.  Reverend Al sat down?  Yeah.  Now I know why we have such a pothole problem in this town.  That's what he was arrested for. Destruction of public property.  He sat down.  Alright. So he sat down and he wanted to get arrested, I'm assuming? 
[72:30]
 Yeah, yeah. He put out a little statement and said anybody who doesn't want to get arrested, don't join him.  Okay.  No, he will be getting arrested.  Alright, so he's online too here, I guess?  Yeah.  Alright, let's put Reverend Al on the phone.  Let me...  I think I've got to check my messages or something.  Where are you going?  I'll be right back.  Get Al on the phone. I'll be right back.  Sure.  I've got to go. Yeah, yeah.  You know, this happens every single time.  We get an exclusive interview and Anthony just leaves the studio. 
[73:00]
 I don't understand what his problem is, man.  Reverend Al, are you there?  Reverend Al?  Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.  Nobody... Oh! Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah, Reverend Al!  I can't sit down.  Reverend Al, I can't sit down.  Last night I was made a bitch.  What do you mean? 
[73:30]
 I was made a bitch.  I was sold to Luther on D Block for seven new parts and a cherry fruit roll-up.  Last night your Reverend Al got the old Johnny Cochran right where it counts.  I put up the good fight.  After all the pushing and shoving, Reverend Al got some backdoor loving.  Ow!  On the good side, I was voted queen of the weight room prom here at Racket.  I am outraged. 
[74:00]
 They called me Reverend Alice.  Reverend Alice? Geez.  It was never part of Reverend Alice's plan that I'd ever, ever get meat in a camp.  Ow!  But I'm trying to fit in. I'm trying hard.  Louis on D Block offered me two Slim G's and a box of Milk Duds to jiggle my ass while I played Shake Your Booty on a kazoo.  Now, wait a minute, Reverend Al, you have way too much dignity to do something like that. Come on.  I was hungry! 
[74:30]
 I danced like Johnny Jackson.  Oh my God, I was starving.  Then I got assaulted in the laundry room.  Oh yeah?  I was by a washing machine doing my laundry.  And a man walked in and said, can I put my load in there?  And I said, sure! Sure, there's plenty of room. Get your friends loads too.  Damn, damn, was that a mistake?  Ow! Ow! Help me. 
[75:00]
 The Latin Kings are on my tail, so please send me your cash so I can make bed.  Damn, where's my, oh!  Oh, my time's up. The guard's here.  I am outraged! Back to myself!  Leave the Reverend's ass alone!  Leave the Reverend's ass!  Don't call me Brandy!  Don't call me Brandy! Help me! Help me! 
[75:30]
 Wow, Reverend Al, exclusive from Rikers, I guess, huh?  Sound a little like him.  Anthony, where the hell were you?  Huh?  Where the hell were you? We just had Reverend Al and...  I was checking my messages. I thought a pager went off.  You just missed it. Reverend Al live from Rikers.  I don't understand where you go.  I was in Perry White's office talking to Lois.  Was Superman here? 
[76:00]
 Call 800-FOR-SNOW. Real. Close.  Oh, sorry about that, Jimmy.  Anthony, priceline.com.  Priceline, great service, Al Faye.  You're going to be staying in a hotel anytime in the near future.

[77:00]
 It was wonderful.  It was a threesome.  Me, her, and Spock.  Did she have a treble in her pants?  Yes.  They aren't very big on grooming in Triacus.  Yes, yes.  It was fabulous.  Wonderful time.  Back to the bridge.  It felt so invigorated with Priceline.  It's going to be big, really big.

 You can't beat that with a Fluss Club.  What is that?  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, free all right now.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Up next, we're going to be playing the latest from Sammy Hagar.  Haven't heard that yet.  We've got to check that out together here.  Sammy Hagar coming in what, Tuesday?  That's what I hear.

[78:30]
 for an interview.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  So make sure you're listening, okay?  Yes.  Mike from Inglewood.  Do you have that Dice Clay routine in a Wave format?  I'd kill to have that on my computer.  Can you email it to me?  Mike, if you're listening, get a tape ready.  We'll play it one more time so you can get it on tape  and put it on your own computer.  We really have to start putting a lot more of our bits on the Internet, Anthony.  I know.  I had the Reverend Al song up there, but people said they were having a hard time downloading it. 
[79:00]
 It was taking a long time.  Then it would cut out in the middle of downloading.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, let's try putting it up there again.  I will.  All right.  I will do that tonight right after I get done playing Half Life.  So five in the morning.  All right.  Also, Mike goes on to say, by the way, didn't believe a f'ing word about that abortion thing  that Monica was talking about last night during the interview.  I guess Monica had an abortion with another guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right after the Clinton affair, she starts seeing another guy got pregnant 
[79:30]
 and she announced to the whole world she had an abortion.  Yeah, his name was Will Stinton.  Yeah, yeah, that was it.  Will Stinton was his name.  Well, Mike writes, Mike and a boyfriend.  I had an abortion with my boyfriend George Glass.  That's sick.  He's George Glass.  Everyone was thinking that it was Clinton's kid when she said it. 
[80:00]
 Well, Mike doesn't believe it.  He says it's a victim routine.  And then Mike writes, and this could be the sickest line of the show,  Mike is surprised she didn't say that as well.  Oh.  And a hush goes over the crowd.  But she did.  And so...  I wouldn't be surprised.  You want to play the dice thing real fast because someone is trying to get this on tape.  Okay, yeah.  Roll your tape if you want this.  Basically, the set up really fast.  Barbara Walters did a horrible job with the interview last night. 
[80:30]
 And we thought it would be much more exciting if Andrew Dice Clay had the interview.  She would have cried a little more, I think.  Yeah, so check this out real fast.  All right, I'd like to welcome this whale to my show.  And you know you're a whale because I could see your blowhole.  Yay!  So you're sucking Clinton's ****, right?  Does he blow his **** on that chubby face of yours?  Or does he pull out and **** all over your big ****, huh?  Come on, answer the question. 
[81:00]
 Answer the question, you whore.  Answer the question!  Oh, look, now she's going to cry.  Get up, Barbara Walters, you're going to cry, huh?  You'll look at her a little bit.  Answer the question.  Answer the question.  Watch your mouth, fool.  You ****ing whore, look at this **** dig, huh?  I don't want you on my ****ing show!  Get the **** out of here, you **** friend!  I wonder what's that?  I heard that a hundred times.  It's still just as funny.  I'm going to see the Dice Man Saturday. 
[81:30]
 Yes, you are.  The governor.  And he's avoiding our show.  I can't understand why.  I know.  I don't understand it either.  I just hope they put me right up front.  You know, we have a, I don't know.  Look at this jerk off up front, huh?  Jerk off you, who, what?  You call me a jerk off?  You're a jerk off, jerk off.  You know, we have a, I don't know, the tape quality is really bad though.  All right, get it.  Oh, the dice, dice?  Yeah, maybe if we set it up and tell the people the quality is really bad, but I think you 
[82:00]
 still would get a pretty good laugh out of this.  We were doing the Grammys, what, two years ago in LA?  Yeah.  At another radio station, obviously, before we got fired for saying the mayor was dead.  Oopsie.  Little mistake.  It cost us our jobs.  Hey, it was funny, right?  Hey, that's funny stuff.  The mayor's dead, right?  What, what, I'm what?  Anyway, so we were at the Grammys in LA a couple years back and we had an interview with 
[82:30]
 Yeah.  And we're like, what the hell are we going to do with Andrew Dice Clay?  There's a husband, everything failed that he did, and it was like, what are we going  to do with him, you know?  Yeah.  So Anthony gets the bright idea that he's going to interview Dice as Dice.  Piss him off.  To completely piss him off.  And we got a tape of it.  Yeah.  You won't even be able to tell who is the real Dice and who's Anthem.  Try to follow along at home.  I know the quality is a little bad, but I think it's worth playing right now, so check 
[83:00]
 it out, all right?  All right, let's hear.  107.3 W.  Let me tell you something.  Forget the music.  I'm on here.  You understand Boston?  You know, I know people.  I know Patty Ross.  She's my friend.  He insisted we stop the record.  We're just glad to see.  We're just glad to see.  Plug your HBO special again.  Let's go into position.  May 11th, 10 p.m. on HBO.  Andrew Dice Clay, thanks a lot.  Okay.  Thank you guys.  And that's an excellent impression.  I really dig you.  And when I come to Boston, I'll come on you again.  All over you.  No.  I got to get out of here before I get nasty. 
[83:30]
 All right, man.  Andrew Dice Clay, huh?  You know, illustrious Dice.  Yeah, a trip down memory lane with that one.  That was amazing.  You won the heckle fight.  Another clown.  All right, well, I don't know if he's going to come in and hang with us this time around.  I don't know.  I guess he's gotten some ideas.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I guess he's gotten some reports that he's on the show all the time anyway. 
[84:00]
 So why bother?  I guess he's too big for us now.  The Rock of New York, 1027W&W.  Later from Sammy Hagar, Mas Tequila, from his forthcoming CD, Red Voodoo.  Right, Ralph?  Mm-hmm.  What can you tell us about Sammy Hagar CD?  When does it come out?  I'm not exactly sure.  Probably another month at least, right?  Yeah, within three to four weeks probably.  Okay.  He's doing that thing over at... 
[84:30]
 Can we say this?  Yeah.  We can talk about it, right?  The Hard Rock?  Yeah.  The Hard Rock's next Thursday.  Yes, Tuesday.  Next Tuesday, you're going to listen to win tickets to see Sammy Hagar.  You can only win them here.  At the Hard Rock Cafe, and of course he's coming in for an interview that day as well  on our show.  Yeah, you guys are busy that day.  You've got Johnny Lang playing live and then Sammy getting crazy with you.  All this coming Tuesday.  Yes.  So we can't wait.  You've got to ask him what prompted him to make a song like Rock and Roll Part 2 by Gary  Glitter.  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  He admits it on the back of the CD.  It says, it contains replayed elements from Rock and Roll Part 2. 
[85:00]
 Yeah, he fesses up.  I mean, it's a great song.  And then he writes, written by the pedophile Gary Glitter.  Did you hear what happened to him?  No, he didn't.  Gary Glitter?  Yeah, I know, but he didn't write that.  That's just brilliant.  Well, it says here on the back, it contains replayed elements from Rock and Roll Part  2 written by the pedophile Gary Glitter.  It doesn't say pedophile.  Oh, someone wrote that in there.  My computer's broken.  Let me take it to get it serviced.  And the guy, this is actually what happened. 
[85:30]
 Gary Glitter's computer broke.  He took it to a place to get it fixed.  And when they popped it up and fixed it, boom, up pops kiddie porn pictures of young boys.  So he is screwed.  Who knew Gary Glitter would have been into young boys?  They should have thrown him in jail for that hair helmet he's been wearing these days.  You see behind the music with Gary Glitter or whatever it is?  I saw him come out when The Who was doing the Quadrofinia thing.  Yeah, it was great.  And he came out and it was just like, oh my goodness, what is he doing? 
[86:00]
 What is this load doing on stage?  Get off.  What was going on?  He just looked like he was all in this tight stuff and his big fat belly and everything.  It was the mods and the rockers.  He was just a mess though.  He was a rocker.  It might have been Cole years ago to have him out there but he was kind of distracted  from things.  All right.  Matt wants to get his plug in.  His shameless plug.  He wants to completely halt our show to plug himself in. 
[86:30]
 I don't even know if it's going to happen the way the Pacer Earl is moving.  Really?  Earl is driving the van up to the beacon.  Yeah, for the Allman Brothers tonight.  Push it up there.  And Matt Devotee with his black eye will be on stage to intro the Allman Brothers.  I'm torn.  I always hated guys who wore shades indoors.  Like you, Pompous Windbag. </pre>
