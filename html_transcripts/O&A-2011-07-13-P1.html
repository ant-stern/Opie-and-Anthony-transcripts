<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with an unexpected introduction by Larry King, setting a bizarre tone for the broadcast.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton initially discussed the MLB All-Star game, finding it dull compared to Derek Jeter's vacation.  The conversation quickly shifted to a critique of the final Harry Potter film, focusing on its excessive violence, particularly the deaths of children, and questioning the parents' choices in sending their children to Hogwarts.  The hosts debated the film's appropriateness for children, discussed the action sequences, actors' appearances (especially Emma Watson's), and revealed some spoilers.

The show then veered into a highly offensive discussion about the portrayal of Asians in media, using racial slurs and stereotypes.  They analyzed Mickey Rooney's stereotypical portrayal in "Breakfast at Tiffany's," the protests against its screening, and contrasted it with Larry David's portrayal of an Asian maid in "Curb Your Enthusiasm."  Clips from "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and racist Bugs Bunny cartoons were shown and discussed.

Patrice O'Neal joined the show as a guest. The conversation turned to their careers, potential departures from the show, and the risks of speaking frankly about their employer and celebrities.  O'Neal shared an anecdote about getting in trouble for commenting on Howard Stern's vacation.

A later segment, featuring Ace Grant as a caller, focused on movies and actors.  Ace recounted a work-related incident involving his employer, who was on safari.  The discussion included opinions on critically panned films like *Waterworld* (which Ace and Jimmy enjoyed), contrasting it with the disliked *Planet of the Apes* (Mark Wahlberg version).  They debated which actors consistently played themselves (Mark Wahlberg, Nicolas Cage, Morgan Freeman, Jack Nicholson) versus those who were great despite this (Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, Daniel Day-Lewis).  A trailer for *Rise of the Planet of the Apes* was shown.  The conversation branched out to other films like *Platoon*, *Apocalypse Now*, *The Godfather*, and *Jaws*.  Ace shared an anecdote about Gallagher making racist remarks, and the hosts briefly touched on *Celebrity Rehab*, mentioning Amy Fisher, Bai Ling, Michael Lohan, and Stephen Adler. The segment concluded with Opie's rapid-fire, sexually explicit, and offensive comedic bit.

Another segment focused on *Celebrity Rehab* and the perceived failures of Dr. Drew.  The hosts criticized Dr. Drew’s lack of success, citing relapses, overdoses, and deaths of former participants (Rodney King, Mike Starr).  They graphically described the physical deterioration of celebrities like Amy Fisher, Bai Ling, and Sean Young, using crude and sexually explicit language.  The hosts questioned Dr. Drew's methods and the ethics of the show, which led to a discussion about the medical profession.  They then criticized Nancy Grace's coverage of the Casey Anthony trial, playing clips and analyzing her interviews.  The segment ended with a vulgar discussion comparing the physiques of male actors across different eras of Hollywood.

Ben Mezrich, author of *Bringing Down the House* and *The Social Network*, appeared as a guest.  They discussed Mezrich's success, his new book *Sex on the Moon* (about a NASA intern who stole and had sex with moon rocks), the moon landing's authenticity, and the FBI investigation.  The hosts and Mezrich bantered, using offensive language.  They also discussed *Bringing Down the House* and its film adaptation, Mezrich's writing process, and the hosts' involvement in breaking the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal, including details about obtaining and disseminating the picture and their interactions with Andrew Breitbart.  They promoted Mezrich's book signings and discussed the future film adaptation of *Sex on the Moon*.

The final segment focused on the aftermath of a leaked photograph, detailing its journey from a woman to Breitbart, then to Opie and Anthony, with multiple photos being taken of the photo itself.  They speculated on Breitbart's motivations, mentioning Colbert's comedic take on Breitbart's explanation.  The hosts discussed the negative impact on a prominent politician, compared the events to Watergate, and joked about the situation.  Ben Mezrich was again present, briefly discussing their potential next book, "Did You Do Good? We Have a Problem,"  their lack of recognition from employers, and a humorous workplace flowchart.  The segment concluded with promotion of Mezrich’s upcoming appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enter it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Ah, good morning.  Morning, morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I like the way Larry King does that little Bobo thing.  Bought away.  Bought away.  Bought away.  Bought away.  Who is Jim Norton?  Bought away.  I can't really do Bobo, but I like trying to do Bobo.  Bought away.  Bought away. 
[00:01:00]  Hey, did you see that All-Star?  Ah, who gives a shit?  I know.  Did you watch the All-Star game?  No.  People are like, why don't you watch the All-Star game?  What the fuck?  Yeah, why?  Why bother?  Is N-Rock trying to make it obnoxiously loud to get back to us today?  I don't know why.  Is it really loud?  Yeah, it's really loud today.  I turned my headphones down.  I think he's fucking with us.  Is he now like, all right, fuckers.  Since we've been beating him up that the rage is a little low in the mix.  Yeah.  And now it seems a bit high.  Like, oh yeah, fucker, watch what I do.  He can't find the perfect medium. 
[00:01:30]  Very tough for E-Rock.  The perfect medium.  Why did you say that?  He hasn't found the perfect medium in 10 years.  No, perfect medium.  The perfect XXL.  Poor E-Rock.  That was a record, by the way.  I know.  Quickest we've ever stopped on him.  You said perfect medium, though.  Yeah.  Poor E-Rock.  He tweets about Harry Potter and then you make a fat joke.  I know.  Like, immediately.  Immediately.  Yeah.  Did you see the All-Star Game? 
[00:02:00]  No.  Not a second of it.  Good for you.  I could give a shite.  You know, if Derek Jeter doesn't give a shit about the All-Star Game, why the fuck should  we?  He was with his chick in Florida.  In South Beach, having a nice lunch and chilling out.  Yeah.  And we're supposed to, you know, care about the All-Star Game.  Give a shit about it.  I think Ronnie was saying on his show the other day that right now, Derek Jeter is Mr. Baseball.  Yeah.  He might not be the best player in the game right now, but he is the face of baseball because  of what's happening.  He's the talked about guy.  Right. 
[00:02:30]  And if he's not at the All-Star Game, then why the fuck are we tuning it in?  And who cares?  And it's just, there's nothing there.  I didn't give a shit.  Who cares?  Who gave a shit?  I like the Home Run Derby and, I don't know, how fast you can run around the bases and  all the other shit they do.  Yeah, what a lot of garbage that they do.  What other?  To try to make it fun.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And make people give a flying fuck.  I enjoy the Home Run Derby, but the game itself, when more and more players are opting out of  the damn thing so they can rest, you know, a fake injury or something. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Because I think if you tell, like, the league, ah, I got an elbow thing, I got ice for the  next couple days.  Ah, don't hurt yourself.  Yeah, I got a thing with my knee, twisted a little bit.  You better not play.  Don't hurt yourself for the season, for the real games.  And then, it's pure lunacy that whatever team wins, that league gets home field advantage  for the World Series win.  I was telling you before the show, a lot of the guys that played in the All-Star Game  don't even have a chance at the World Series this year. 
[00:03:30]  So why would they give a fuck?  They don't care.  Home field advantage for who?  Not me.  You think Halliday's going to blow out his arm?  Yeah.  For what?  They're not going to allow that, first of all.  No.  So it's not a real game.  They get everybody in there to show their face a little bit, show a little skill, and  that's it.  Yeah.  It's not a real baseball game.  So why are you making it mean so much?  Yep.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  It's just dumb.  Yeah, it's not exciting.  I mean, baseball itself isn't the most exciting game to watch. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  I mean, if you're a fan of a team, when it starts getting down to the end of the season,  and then, you know, lucky your team makes the playoffs, then it's exciting.  Sure.  But an All-Star Game?  Who cares?  Nah.  Home Run Derby?  Absolutely.  But, you know, I don't know.  The rest of it was just...  I didn't watch because...  Borefest.  I didn't watch because I went and saw Harry Potter.  Oh, how was that?  Remember when you would go on the radio and say, I went and saw Harry Potter, like, everyone  would call you a faggot immediately?  Yeah, fruit. 
[00:04:30]  But somehow she twisted that whole movie thing into...  It's kind of...  It's the place to be.  It's not as faggot-y.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just not as faggot-y.  Well, when you watch the first ones, and it's little kids riding around on brooms.  Right.  You're like, yeah.  They got little magic wands.  But now there's some real dark shit in these movies.  Now there's like people are dying and fucking blowing shit up.  Dude, there's a...  Yeah.  This movie, I was telling you, is the climax to any action movie.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  But it's two hours of a climax to the other movie plus the series in general.  So...  Because it's part two, obviously, right?  Yeah, what you're really getting is the last movie, which was the lead-up.  Right.  And then this movie, which is the action sequence.  Yes, for two straight hours.  So it's two hours of just battle.  I don't know where you're at.  I like action movies.  I don't love action movies because I need a good story.  Yeah.  I don't mind seeing cars blowing up and car chases and all that, but I also need a little  substance.  Yeah.  And that's always bothered me, those movies that are just nothing but action-packed. 
[00:05:30]  I've never been a huge, huge fan of those.  Yeah.  I like a story behind the action for sure.  And this movie was just complete action.  I mean, complete action.  And they slowed this movie down for maybe a total of, what, 10 minutes, Iraq?  Iraq was there and Rome was there.  Oh, Iraq.  Yeah.  It was just nonstop people dying and shit blowing up.  And I'm thinking, if you're a parent, because now I'm a parent, so I think other shit.  Yeah.  Why the fuck would you ever send your kid to Hogwarts with all that lunacy happening? 
[00:06:00]  Like, they sign their kids up like, yep, you're going to Hogwarts.  Get to the train station and do that little thing.  And in this movie, I'm not giving much away.  When they do slow it down and show all the damage, there's just dead kids everywhere.  And I'm like, whose bright idea was this to send their kid to Hogwarts?  I never heard anyone put it that way.  Yeah.  Why the fuck would you do that?  Why would you do that when there's all this evil and darkness and just pure lunacy? 
[00:06:30]  Maybe the first year was all cute.  Right.  You know.  Also, the headmistress or whatever the fuck, she's like, we got to secure the school.  I'm like, yeah.  Man, when I went to Geneseo, we never had to secure the school from evil and darkness.  Evil.  I don't think my parents would have allowed me to go to Geneseo if they knew that was happening.  If they knew evil was going on.  A lot of evil.  A lot of evil.  If my fellow students were dead all over the place, how am I supposed to study for my finals?  There was a lot of scenes of just close-ups of dead kids where people are crying and then just pulling blankets over their head. 
[00:07:00]  Are you shitting me?  No.  I'm like, why?  Because of evil.  The evil.  That makes no sense.  The first few movies, it was like, oh, it was just some mischief.  Yeah, I don't even think anyone.  It was mischief.  Did anyone really die in the first few movies of importance?  I don't even remember anymore.  I think it was just mischief.  People got hurt.  Yeah, but they had classroom scenes where the.  Fill off their brooms.  Where the professor had some weird spell and you saw some really cool shit. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  None of this in that movie.  No.  You're seeing.  Or none of that in this movie.  I should have said.  Yeah.  You're seeing blood on stairs and on the dirt and on the wall.  Fucking Hogwarts.  Huge rubble just falling on children.  Who's going there?  I don't know.  Who's sending their kids?  And then at the end, everyone's happy.  And I'm like, how are you happy?  Fucking half the school just died.  I'm not giving away spoilers.  I mean, everyone knows this is just one of those crazy over the top.  Are there other people like known characters that have been around for pretty much the whole 
[00:08:00]  thing that don't make it through?  Well, if I read any of the books and saw all the movies, I would be able to answer that  question.  Oh, OK.  All I know is.  You're hanging on to a shred of your manhood.  Well, I tweeted yesterday.  You learn that Snape or something like that is Harry's father.  And I don't even know why that's a big deal.  I don't know.  Is that a big one?  Is that a big spoiler?  I saw you tweet that last night and I really had a good laugh.  Oh, why?  Big spoiler?  I haven't read the books, but I think that's a big spoiler.  Oh, wow.  Who knew? 
[00:08:30]  But then again, if you've read the books, there are no spoilers to this movie.  I wanted people to know that I saw this movie.  So I'm like, oh, Snape is Harry's father.  All right.  I haven't even seen it and it's a spoiler to me, but I still thought it was hilarious.  Oh, but then there was like a lot of excitement outside of the theater because everyone just  assumed the movie was going to follow the book.  Yeah.  And that's the beautiful twist here.  Oh, it didn't.  They twisted some shit up to trick everybody because everyone's like, oh, I know what this  movie is going to be about because I read the book. 
[00:09:00]  It fucked up the readers out there.  Yeah, that was the buzz, I guess.  I guess because the big fans read the book.  They read the book.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the Snape thing, though, I guess that I guess that's a big deal for some people.  I don't really know.  It says, oh, M.G.  Snape is his.  I guess if people don't care, they don't care.  Yeah.  I don't blame them for not caring.  Look at young Harry Potter.  Yeah.  That's the cute little days. 
[00:09:30]  That's when when you went and saw Harry Potter, they would absolutely call you a faggot and  not in the way where you suck dick or take cock.  No, no, of course not.  It was just a thing you said to people and you didn't even know what the gay thing was  about.  He's wearing his little wizard robe with his big sleeves.  Yeah.  And he's got his little magic wand.  And now what?  Is he all badass?  He's wearing regular clothes, regular clothes.  I'm like, you're at Hogwarts and you got something from L.L.  Bean.  L.L.  Bean.  I don't know.  Is he wearing some Abercrombie and fish?  It kind of took me out of the movie. 
[00:10:00]  I'm like, why is he in regular clothes?  If he's in this in this world of wizardry, wizardry where everyone else has the law cloaks  and you know what I mean?  You got to wear wizardry clothes.  And he has like a, I don't know, those like like a tweed jacket on.  I'm like, what?  How is Hans Gruber?  Which one was he?  Oh, the blonde guy.  No, he's Hans Gruber, the dark haired guy that was in Die Hard.  Oh, that's.  Oh, that's Snape?  That's Snape, I guess.  Oh, okay.  That's Harry's father.  Oh, that's Harry's dad?  Yeah.  Oh, that makes sense.  You learned that.  There was some kind of flashback and you're like, oh, this is what this whole thing's 
[00:10:30]  about.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They found a lot of creative ways to kill off the kids in this movie.  They killed kids.  It's like they're falling into caverns, bridges are burning and blowing up.  The earth's opening up and swallowing them.  And the kids are just dying all over the place.  That's fucked up.  And I'm thinking to myself, okay, I don't mind kids dying in movies.  I really don't.  But I'm thinking, you know, out of the box, I'm like, who would send their kid here?  Why go?  I'm sure there was other wizardry schools that could promise the parents that their 
[00:11:00]  kids aren't going to die because there's no E-V-E-L.  Oh, E-V-E-L.  Go to like the wizardry community college.  Exactly.  In your town.  I don't think I want to send my kid to a college where there's a really good chance  that he's going to die.  That the earth is going to swallow him?  Yes.  Or that some E-V-E-L guy is going to come and.  Wipe out half the school.  And then by the end of the movie, everyone's happy.  It's like.  That doesn't make sense.  And I said that earlier, but how is that possible?  That never makes sense in TV shows and movies.  Nah.  All of a sudden, everybody's happy after a big fucking wipe out. 
[00:11:30]  I guess Harry is a drunk or something.  The paper is saying that he stopped drinking.  He stopped?  He said he wanted to enjoy his life without alcohol or something because he was depending  on alcohol to have a good time.  Oh, to get through these fucking movies.  But he's only 21.  So, I mean, think about what you were doing at 21.  And I mean, the people out there as well.  Maybe he's like Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, it's normal.  He's just crazy.  It's normal to party and get a little crazy.  But if you're in the spotlight, that's not normal.  They start looking at you like, whoa, what's his issue over there? 
[00:12:00]  Maybe he's got a problem.  What about that?  Yeah.  Emma Watson.  Was she pretty?  Was she pretty in the movie?  She was just wearing a denim jacket through the whole.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  They were all wearing street clothes.  How about what?  What about the wizardry clothes?  They were wearing street clothes because what?  Were they kicked out of the Hogwarts or something?  What?  Is that a spoiler?  I don't think so.  I think you learned that in the last movie.  All right, Iraq.  Yeah.  They left the school in order to protect the school so they could fight Voldemort. 
[00:12:30]  Well, they didn't protect the school because they're going to have to rebuild it from scratch.  The whole fucking place was destroyed.  You could see.  I noticed on some bus boards around the city, they show them battling with their little wands.  And the place is just a wreck.  Yes.  The place is fucking wrecked.  I'm really not giving away anything.  They did do a nice scene where she's dressed up.  She's using magic and dressed up as another character.  Oh, yeah?  And as they're falling to the ground, you're just seeing right down her blouse. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, they did one or two nice boob shots.  Of Emma?  Yeah.  Emma Watson.  She hasn't really developed boobies, though.  Eh, kind of.  And her features are washed out.  What do you mean?  I'm not a fan of women that have features that are washed out.  What do you mean washed out?  They're kind of just, like, you know, faded.  Has she got that British kind of pale thing?  Everything's pale, even her eyebrows.  Her eyebrows are pale.  Everything's pale on her.  I don't know.  Pale lips.  Yeah.  Not ruby red.  Did you like the movie, Rock? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, I liked it a lot.  Yeah.  Why?  Because it finally ended everything.  Oh.  But, uh...  You like the movie because now it's done?  It's done.  Is that it?  But, uh, yeah, it was, like you said, it's two hours.  You like to name the school after you?  Oh, come on.  All right.  I'm teasing.  Come on.  Iraq knows I'm teasing.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, it was just, it was two hours.  It was just everything blowing up, people dying.  Like, you weren't bored watching this movie at all. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  It was fantastic.  Yeah, there's no way you could be bored.  A lot of action.  A lot of action.  That Harry knows how to use a wand.  I, uh, I guess I'm gonna have to just watch one through, what is that, seven, eight of  them?  Eight.  Eight of them?  You never watched them?  I've seen pieces of the, I've seen the whole first one.  I wanna see the...  Like, years ago, when it first came out.  I wanna see the first one to see...  How fruity it is?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Because they definitely went dark as the series went on. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, he's just like, you know...  And he's just a little kid and they're all...  Right.  They're at Hogwarts.  Hogwarts and not...  Just getting in trouble with their little magic wands just sparkling and not really doing  anything.  I would have...  Oh, whoops.  I would have just killed Harry Potter years ago because he's the problem.  Yeah.  Because before he went to the school, there weren't dead kids all over the place.  He's the fucking problem.  He's the one that the bad guy's after, right?  Yeah.  Because of some legacy, I guess.  Really?  Yeah, I don't know.  Is that a spoiler? 
[00:15:00]  Is it a spoiler, Iraq?  No.  Not a fucking idea.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Dead kids, right, E?  Everywhere.  Dead kids everywhere.  I mean, right when the...  Everywhere.  I mean, it was nonstop action, but right when the really big scenes were happening where  the school's just getting attacked, kids are running, shooting their wands, and all  of a sudden, some big ogre knocks off part of a building and it just collapses.  Just smashes the kids.  Yeah.  And you don't see what happened.  They're just gone.  They can't use wizardry to get the bricks off of them.  Where are the authorities to shut down this school? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  That's like child abuse.  There's some major violations going on here.  Terrible.  Schools need metal detectors these days.  Yeah.  And there's wizardry going on.  And there's this huge snake going around just killing people.  But it's so violent.  Like, you just see the snake.  It comes up slow.  It opens its mouth, hisses a little bit, and then it's just...  Like, just really big thrusts and going through people.  Sounds terrible.  It sounds, like, harrowing.  Well, I would love to see other shit, but I know a lot of people are going to see this 
[00:16:00]  movie.  Do they go around at the end and bring them all back to life?  No.  Oh, okay.  So maybe that happened.  No, at the end.  Then they could smile and laugh.  Aha.  Remember that?  At the end, you just see the circle of life.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  The circle of life.  They might have fast-forwarded a few years just to...  Oh, really?  They rebuilt the school on the bodies of the dead.  Yeah.  They did.  Yeah.  You know how Ground Zero, they're kind of not messing with the area where a lot of people 
[00:16:30]  die?  The footprints, yes.  Hogwarts says, fuck that.  Hogwarts, they don't care.  This pillar is going to go right where 10 kids lost it.  Children fucking were crushed here, but...  Right.  We're going to rebuild this fucking thing.  You were talking about, like, did they bring people back?  There's something that he found that could have done that.  But he decided to go, no, I'll just leave it in the woods, and doesn't even bother saving  anybody.  Is that a spoiler?  Well, I don't know.  I think he was only...  That sounds like a spoiler.  I think he was only allowed to use that one time, was my guess. 
[00:17:00]  What?  What kind of rule is that?  I don't know.  There was...  I don't know.  A lot of CGI?  I would imagine.  Crazy?  Yeah, I would imagine.  A lot of CGI?  I would imagine.  If I was an actor in that movie, I wouldn't even know what I was getting myself into.  So this is the first one, right?  Yeah.  And they're little kids, and they're riding brooms, and it's all cute.  Right.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then the last one, not so much.  Not so much, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:17:30]  I don't think I could do it.  The school just looks way too fucking...  I don't know.  What's that little game they played?  They play that?  Oh, Quidditch?  Did they play Quidditch?  No.  They didn't do anything.  No games?  They were just running and trying not to die.  They were just running and trying not to die.  That's very good.  Very good.  Absolutely.  That's what happened.  Dying and not dying.  Oh, my God.  Not one...  Well, there were spells, but not the ones that kind of made the other movies cool. 
[00:18:00]  It was all about the wands.  No, these were violent spells.  Think lightsabers.  Really?  It's pretty much Star Wars with wands.  So, like, that red and blue light that I see on the bus boards?  Yeah, that's just...  Yeah, doing that kind of shit.  Wands.  Cutting through things?  Oh, yeah.  Can they get the lightning from the magic wand cut through things?  Oh, yeah.  Sending people on fire.  They're turning into ash.  Yeah.  And these kids' parents are somewhere just thinking their kids are safe at school. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, that's good.  They're at school.  I'm obsessing with that.  Thank God.  This is crazy.  Yeah, there's some parents somewhere just going to bed, going like, oh, yeah, my kid's  at Hogwarts, by the way.  Yep.  Where's your kid?  Yep.  Oh, Cornell?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Right.  That's good.  Mine's at Hogwarts.  Mine's dead.  Yeah, yeah.  Just, I don't know it yet, but it's just turned to ashes.  Mine's at Hogwarts and has decided that, you know, Harry's the chosen one, so they're  going to risk their own lives to make sure Harry does what he has to do, whatever the  fuck that is, because I don't even know what it means in the end. 
[00:19:00]  What's your kid?  Oh, poli-sci?  Yeah, yeah, that's cool.  Mine's wizardry.  Fucking fighting the evil.  What's yours doing?  Yep.  Holy shit.  There's weird scenes where, like, a group of them are together, like, say, in what was  a huge hall of the school.  Some are just, like, huddled around together drinking coffee or water or something, just  like, what are we going to do next?  And then it pans over maybe 10 feet, and there's people crying because there's a dead child  in there.  Oh, my God.  And they're pulling the blanket slowly over the face. 
[00:19:30]  Are you kidding me?  I mean, the camera's moving in so you can see which person had, which child had died  as the blanket's going over their eyes.  This is terrible.  And they're all, and then Harry has to walk through the scene, and they're all giving Harry  a look like, you know, you fucking-  This is your fault.  You fucking caused all this.  Look at him.  He's like a man.  He's cut up.  Oh, yeah.  He just gives him dirty looks.  Like, look, I'm doing shit here.  I don't care that everyone's dying.  Wow.  They had one scene.  This is for all the people that think Harry's hot.  Oh, boy.  Where he had to change clothes. 
[00:20:00]  He naked?  Well, he didn't have a shirt on.  Oh.  And he took a long time to get his new shirt on.  Do you think he's gay in real life?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Why?  Is there-  I don't know.  There's rumors.  There's a thing?  There's rumors.  There's a thing?  Oh, look at him.  Yes.  I like him in Equus.  Yeah.  By the horse.  Yeah.  He slowly had to put his new shirt on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  Does Emma Sam-  Emma Sam-  Listen to me.  I'm going back to fucking general hospital days. 
[00:20:30]  When Emma-  Emma Watson, does she and the redhead get off?  Well-  Are they like-  They made out in this movie, but-  Yeah.  Didn't they make out in the other movie, E-Rock?  No.  This was the first time.  Oh.  Oh.  Is that a spoiler?  Is that a spoiler?  It's right as they're trying-  I'm really not trying to do spoilers.  I just don't know this shit.  Whoops.  I thought they already were like a romantic couple in the last movie.  You sure?  Or they were just hitting-  Not that I remember in the last movie, but this was just like- 
[00:21:00]  They just scared at each other.  Spoiler.  Ah, see.  Could have been a spoiler right there.  Quick kiss, and then they run because they think they're going to die.  Well, yeah.  Of course.  All right.  But they're not going to die because they get married in the end, so-  Oh, do they?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Whoops.  Whoops.  Spoiler.  Is that what you saw, Iraq?  They had kids.  They had kids.  We're getting a shut the fuck up about Harry Potter.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry about that.  I don't know what I'm-  I don't know.  I don't know this shit.  Sorry about that. 
[00:21:30]  Why is it important?  I don't know.  I don't think it is.  If you read the book, you know most of the stuff, except for the twist.  The big fans read the book.  What is that?  It's his dick.  Oh.  It's his dick.  Hey, Potter.  That's on Perez Hilton, I guess.  Oh, good old Harry's dick.  That's from Equus, I think.  Here's his dick.  I bet it is.  His dick.  Nice dick.  Is he still with Rob Bartlett, or did he have to blow off the play because the Harry Potter  thing's out now?  Oh, that How to Succeed in Business?  Yeah.  He's doing a play with our pal.  Yeah.  I think he's still with that.  Matter of fact, I don't know if I talked about this on the air. 
[00:22:00]  It's really quick.  Rob Bartlett took care of my little niece.  She's not little anymore.  She's 18 or 19.  Yeah.  She came up to New York, and she's a big Broadway broad.  Yeah.  She wants to do a little of this, either behind the scenes or on the stage.  She's going to college for this, and she's actually producing her own play in Florida.  She's actually got some skills, right?  So every time she comes to New York, she likes to check out some of these shows.  Yeah.  So I asked Rob Bartlett for a favor, and she went and saw the Salesman movie. 
[00:22:30]  What is it called again?  How to Succeed in Business.  Oh, How to Succeed in Business.  And Rob Bartlett got a picture with fucking Harry Potter.  That's a biggie.  My niece got a picture with Harry Potter.  Naked?  Naked, yes.  It was a dick.  And there were thousands, not thousands, but probably a hundred girls outside the theater  hoping for the same fucking thing.  Preferential treatment.  And Rob took care of her and got a picture with her and Harry Potter.  He doesn't look very Harry Potter-ish there.  No. 
[00:23:00]  In that.  No face wounds.  You think they're going to continue with the Harry Potter series?  Didn't she say that's it?  Someone else taking it over?  That's what I'm thinking.  That was the twist.  Oh, shit.  That's what I'm thinking.  Oh, spoiler?  I think the books might-  Is that a spoiler?  I think the books might be done, but-  Movies?  Someone could obviously pick on the franchise.  Keep going.  Because now it's a movie franchise, right?  Yeah, why ruin it?  They set it up where it could easily continue.  Easily. 
[00:23:30]  So more kids go to Hogwarts and die and stuff.  Yeah.  Maybe they'll make it fun again.  Right.  Bring in some more little kids and make it cute.  Yeah.  You should have went to Harry Potter last night.  Eh.  Fucking-  Oh, Jesus.  Come on, Sam.  You know what?  Showing his big fat hog.  I didn't like the 3D.  Oh, it was 3D?  Iraq?  It might have been where we were sitting.  I didn't-  No, because I sat in probably that exact seat for Avatar. 
[00:24:00]  Oh.  You know, iMac is that-  It's massive, right?  Yeah.  Or iMacs.  I always make these things.  Yeah, I know.  Whatever it is.  I didn't like the 3D.  Did they add the 3D after the fact?  Yeah, they-  That's why.  There was a big-  I guess the producers and the director had a big fight with Warner Brothers.  They did-  So they didn't make it 3D.  So the 3D was more to show depth perception rather than the stuff coming flying at you.  Yeah.  No, but see, I like the 3D technology.  See, you didn't see Avatar in a theater. 
[00:24:30]  They used the 3D technology beautifully.  Dare I say the word beautifully, but they did.  But when they take these movies and then add the 3D after the fact, I don't think it works as much.  I think if you use that as a tool as you're making your movie, it could be spectacular.  Instead of just throw it on at the end, like, hey, let's say it's 3D.  Yeah, because 3D's hot right now.  Yeah.  You could tell the difference is what I'm saying.  So I don't know.  Well, I'll see it when it comes on cable or something. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really, I'm not a big fan of the series.  I don't know.  And now to watch it from the beginning, I've got to watch the little cutesy kid part.  Yeah, start from the beginning, do a marathon, and then go to the theater and see the final movie.  I guess I'll do that.  What else is going on?  All-Star Game was a bust.  Yeah, that sucked.  I didn't watch that.  No.  It was a pretty boring friggin' evening, to tell you the truth.  Oh, really?  It was hot as fuck.  It was really.  It was swamp hot.  It was about it, yeah.  Like that horrible, sticky hot. 
[00:25:30]  Vietnam hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it, you rule.  Oh, my God.  This is what happened after the show?  After.  Get the fuck out of here.  You want to do this now?  Oh, yeah.  This is great.  Okay.  I was going to talk about what's going on with the Brooklyn Bridge Park thing, but you want  to do that real fast?  What's that?  The Asian-American group. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, we were talking about this before the show.  So we got these stupid Asian groups.  They're very sensitive these days.  Yeah, but they don't make any sense whatsoever.  Because it's very hard for them to really find things to piss them off.  And these big corporations are allowing them to have a voice.  Yeah.  You know, if you listen to this show, that radio guys got in trouble for doing the Asian  accent on a regular radio show.  Right.  Following FCC regulations, and they got fired.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  And the Asian-American groups, they just won't stop.  They're now going to protest the showing of Breakfast at Tiffany's.  Now, that's an old movie.  At the Brooklyn Bridge Park.  So, you know, in the summer here in New York, I'm sure you have it in your city, too.  They do movies outdoors.  Out of doors.  I've checked out a couple of these.  They're kind of cool.  Yeah.  You watch the movie a little bit, but it's just the whole...  It's more just being outside.  Yeah, it's just the whole atmosphere, you know?  And they're going to protest Breakfast at Tiffany's because Mickey Rooney's character  is racist and offensive.  What does he do? 
[00:27:00]  I'm sure...  Oh.  Okay.  Is that Mickey Rooney?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, look.  All right.  So, he went old school.  Oh, is that great.  I never...  Have you seen Tiffany's...  No.  Breakfast at Tiffany's?  Never saw it.  Can we get that scene?  Oh, my God.  We're looking at a picture of Mickey Rooney.  He was doing the over-the-top, stereotypical Asian face.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is like Japanese.  And for some reason, to make the Asian face look even more ridiculous, you have to wear  big, dark...  Those big, round glasses. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  And then...  And the buck teeth.  Yes.  So, they're protesting that, I guess.  He looks...  Wow, that is over-the-top.  But still.  When was the time?  1961?  Oh.  Are you going to try to find it?  Okay.  My point being, really quickly, Curb Your Enthusiasm started up their new season on HBO,  and the first episode was great, with Larry doing the tampon thing with the 13-year-old.  There's a little outrage about that now.  Why?  We can maybe get into that later.  But part of the first episode, Larry knocks on this door, and this Asian maid comes to 
[00:28:00]  the door, can't speak English, over-the-top Asian accent, broken English.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Pretty much doing that.  Awesome.  And I would say to the Asian groups, why don't you go after your own people first?  Yeah.  Because they're making it acceptable by doing that.  By doing the whole, yeah.  So why don't you guys get together as a group and say, okay, look, all you Asian actors,  don't fucking, you know, accept a role where you have to be a stereotypical Asian. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  Because my point is, if they're allowed to do it, why can't we do it?  Yeah.  Not like they're doing the over-the-top Asian person.  Over-the-top, but they would say, well, they're Asian, that's why they can.  But isn't that hurting their group, too?  I would think.  Perpetuating stereotypes.  You got the scene?  Yeah.  Oh, you got the Mickey Rooney as the Japanese guy from Breakfast at Tiffany's.  Oh, by the way, 1961, 50 years ago.  Okay.  Okay. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, sign.  Oh, sign.  Oh, sign.  Oh, sign.  Oh, sign.  Oh, sign.  Oh, sign.  Oh, sign.  He's so...  Oh, God.  He's so japped.  He...  Oh, they must hate this.  It's like Mr. Miyagi times 20. 
[00:29:30]  They're coming upstairs.  Yeah, they're going to Rooney any second.  Oh, darling, I am sorry, but I lost my key.  But that was two weeks ago.  You cannot go on or keep ringing my bell.  You disturb me.  You must have a key made.  Oh, wow.  I may have to agree with them on this one.  No, I'm kidding.  It's so, wow, because, you know, they've shut this shit down, basically. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  You're not allowed to do this anymore.  So when you do see it, it seems way over the top.  It does.  It does.  You watch this and just go, like, oh, boy.  He's got massive buck teeth, horrible Asian eyes.  It's almost like they put those wacky Asian glasses you used to be able to buy in, like, novelty stores.  It's like you put a pair of those on and just went to town.  I want to thank Seth.  Here's the line from Curb.  You do bad things to Miss Kiera.  Oh.  You do bad things. 
[00:30:30]  Right, but do it over the top Asian.  So, you know, the Asian group should go after their own.  Yeah.  They're helping that along.  Holy shit.  Let's get back to Mickey Rooney.  That's fucking great.  I'm sorry, but I lost my key.  But that was two weeks ago.  You cannot go on or keep ringing my bill.  You disturb me.  You must have a key made.  But it won't do any good.  I just lose them all.  Come on, baby.  You like me.  You know you do.  I worship you, Mr. Alba.  But good night, Mr. Alba.  Oh, baby, wait a minute.  What is this?  You like me.  I'm a liked guy. 
[00:31:00]  You like me, baby.  You know you do.  Didn't I pick up the check for five people?  Your friends?  I've never seen them before.  And when you ask for the change for the powder room, what do I give you?  A $50 bill.  Now, doesn't that give me some rights?  In 30 seconds, I got to call a police.  Police.  All the time at this time.  I cannot see.  I got to get to my rest.  I'm an artist.  I got to call my swag on you.  Don't be angry, you dear little man.  I won't do it again.  Wow.  If you promise not to be angry, I might have to take this picture as we mention. 
[00:31:30]  When?  Sometime.  Anytime.  Good night.  Oh, my God.  So.  That is.  That's way over the top.  Do you have a problem with that?  I don't have a problem with it.  Oh, good.  No, I didn't think you did that.  If they got to go back 50 years to find something, I'd say they're doing pretty good.  And it's a movie, you know, it's a classic, obviously.  People talk about this movie like it's royalty.  Yeah.  Royalty.  But now the Asian American groups are like, they should not show it at the Brooklyn Bridge 
[00:32:00]  Park because of Mickey Rooney's portrayal of an Asian man.  I could see.  Imagine how uncomfortable that'll be on the huge screen over there when he's just doing  that and there's Asian people watching like, oh, God.  You know, what they should do is show that in Queens.  Yeah.  Showing Queens and Flushing.  Yeah.  Girl Flushing would enjoy that.  Oh, my God.  I swear it looks like a South Park character.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mickey Rooney's doing a South Park character.  It was so over the top. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  God.  So.  Breakfast at Tiffany's starring Catherine Hepburn.  Is that Catherine Hepburn?  Uh, no.  Audrey Hepburn?  Which one is that?  Uh, no.  That's, uh.  I think it's Audrey.  It's Audrey Hepburn?  Audrey Hepburn.  Yeah.  Audrey Hepburn.  Were they related?  I guess so.  The Hepburns were related?  Right?  I don't know.  I just said it into a microphone.  It's got to be true.  It's true.  Audrey.  Audrey Hepburn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, Blackfist at Tiffany's. 
[00:33:00]  She was quite a looker.  Kevin from Connecticut writes, you mean Mickey Rooney.  Mickey Rooney.  Oh, man.  Enough.  Enough of this.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't go back and change shit.  Yeah.  That's what it was.  Yeah, that's it.  Exactly what it was.  You can't change history.  They were distantly related?  Oh, yes.  I thought they were like sisters or something.  How are they distantly related?  Many, uh, moon ago.  They slept with the same guy or something?  How are they related? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  What happened?  They said they were like cousins.  Yeah.  Kissing cousins.  Let me say hi to Tony in Mississippi.  Tony!  Hey, yeah.  Hey, just this past Sunday on Family Guy, they did a hilarious slash racist Asian joke involving  Peter being a sketch artist, and then they did a callback shortly after that.  Looking hilarious.  Well, you really put it across as funny.  Hmm.  Nope. 
[00:34:00]  Sorry.  Because of Tony, no more listener phone calls.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Put an hour on the clock, Sam.  Sorry, fellas.  It's night-night time.  No call.  One hour.  If you want to talk to us, you're going to have to wait until 745, thanks to Tony.  No more call for one hour.  Wow!  One hour.  Wow!  That Mickey, wow.  Isn't that great?  But you could see how, like, in a public forum, that would be very upsetting to some people.  Like the Asian family sitting on a little blanket in the park, and then Mickey Rooney's 
[00:34:30]  character comes on, and there's just a family next to him looking over like, oh, boy.  Tough shit.  Are they digging this?  I don't think so.  Learn how to pronounce the eight.  Yeah.  Come on.  Tough shit.  Learn how to pronounce the eight.  Move your mouth a little wider.  L, L, L, R, R, L, R, R, L, R.  If I was Asian, that's all I would do all day.  L, L, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, L, right? 
[00:35:00]  Right.  Why is it our problem?  Yeah.  Why can't we do that?  When I got into broadcasting and had a horrendous Long Island accent, guess what I did?  Get rid of it?  I just read AP copy all night long because I was doing overnights to try to get rid of it.  And pronounce your R's?  All that shit.  Aw.  Now I'm a stammering fuck, but I mean, back then, I was hoping to be a polished broadcaster. 
[00:35:30]  A real broadcaster.  Yeah.  Not the shock jockery.  Hey, can we do more Asian shit today?  Because now I'm in the mood.  I really want to see some of that.  You know what I should bring in?  We haven't done in a while.  The racist Bugs Bunny cartoons.  Oh, those are hilarious.  That my buddy Buzzy, who's now living in Atlanta, gave us years ago.  During World War II, they really got on the Japs.  Oh, boy, did they get on the Japs.  And Hitler with swastikas and all that shit.  And this used to be on TV.  No problem. 
[00:36:00]  And then they started banning these episodes of Bugs Bunny.  Yeah.  Nips the nips.  Bugs Bunny and Nips the nips.  Nips the nips.  So this is on YouTube still?  Oh, yeah.  Awesome.  Well, somewhere in the Pacific.  The Pacific.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Somewhere in the Pacific.  Nice.  A little sky shot.  Uh-oh.  Someone's rocking my dreamboat. 
[00:36:30]  Remember this?  As a kid, I didn't find this offensive.  I just thought it was kind of funny.  But, you know, different time.  Suddenly something went wrong.  He's floating in a little carrot box in the Pacific.  Someone's rocking my dreamboat.  I bet a Japsub comes up or something.  He's kind of stranded.  Just killing time till the island that inevitably joins up in this kind of picture.  Inevitably joins up. 
[00:37:00]  That's funny.  Someone's rocking my dreamboat.  I'm Captain Went Up.  Uh-oh.  Ah, an island.  See?  What did I tell you?  The inevitable island.  Right.  Swims over.  These were great.  What a beauteous garden of evil.  Oh, there's going to be a Jap on this island.  A fragrant beauty.  Oh, yeah.  A lustrous toil of the Pacific. 
[00:37:30]  A bad one, too, I bet.  So peaceful.  So quiet.  Uh-oh.  Flack.  There's a war on, mister.  Taking a while to get to the part we want, by the way.  I see the...  We just want to look at the nips.  It gets to the...  Uh-oh.  Well, it says nips.  Yeah.  So...  Uh-oh.  Nips the nips.  He hopped in a pile of hay, and there seems to be somebody in there.  Already.  Oh, there he is. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, my God.  He's chasing him with a knife.  He's throwing a bomb down his hole.  He's got buck teeth in those glasses.  You know, he's got a big buck teeth in glasses. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, Bugs just handed him the bomb back.  Oh, boy.  But he's okay.  He's just a little disheveled.  Yeah.  Oh, he's just like...  He's just like a general.  Oh, not wanting me to hurry, hurry.  Oh, honorable.  Ah-ha.  That's not a Japanese general.  Oh, no.  That's a Bugs Bunny. 
[00:39:00]  My auntie and one brother,  Rian Slesinger, Mary Mary, the cartoon bitch.  Oh, yes, he know for me.  Ah, what's up, honorable doctor?  Honorable.  Honorable.  All right.  And he's chasing him with a giant machete.  We'll cut our losses, bud.  Unbelievable.  They don't show that on TV anymore.  No, you won't see that during the Saturday morning cartoons, kids. 
[00:39:30]  Way too offensive now.  Growing up, though, I saw that one.  Yeah.  I remember seeing that one growing up.  I didn't think differently of Asians.  No, I just thought he was some wacky character.  That's what happens in the end.  I don't think differently of people  just because it's portrayed like this on a TV show or a movie.  I wasn't thinking like,  oh, that's how Japanese people are.  I just thought, wow, that's a funny character.  Yeah, I just always thought they were stupid.  Oh, Jesus.  Let's say hi to Joe in North Carolina. 
[00:40:00]  Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You know Joe.  Don't forget about the Christmas story in the restaurant.  When they're trying to teach them how to sing fa-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra.  Oh, fa-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra.  When they're doing the Christmas song.  Have they edited that out of the showing of Christmas story?  I bet they'll get upset with that, though.  Oh, yeah, they will.  If they haven't already.  Yeah.  They haven't last year.  That could be one of the best ones ever.  The fa-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra.  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah, look, they're singing.  Oh, shit.  I went to the phones.  Oh, damn it. 
[00:40:30]  Fuck.  That happened.  Just broke my own rule.  Start the hour again.  Alright, start it over?  Start the clock.  Alright, 7.52.  We'll take phone calls again.

[00:49:30]  you know why  holy crap  enough already  the guy is a part timer  god bless Howard Stern  I'm not even  I'm not mad at him  at all  no  but the fact is  he's a part timer now  well  he works six days in July  and I mentioned this  and I get in trouble  that calendar  that's been put up  all over  looks like a bingo board  I mean the truth hurts  it is what it is  Michael  in the view  of the team  Michael Jordan  could take a shit  on a referee's foot  right 
[00:50:00]  and the third guy can't  and everything's fine  so that's how they see you  but Horace Grant  would get kicked out of the league  they see you  you're Horace Grant  see I'm just showing you  that I know a little  about the Bulls  from back in the day  yeah they'd look at you  as Horace Grant  but I don't  thank you  thank you sir  thank you  but I'm in trouble now  I had an elevator ride yesterday  I'm like leave me alone  I'm like if the company  you know if the company's gonna like  get me in trouble  for something like this  I don't wanna be here  I go the guy's suing the company  and he's a part timer  when does he get in trouble  when the fuck does he get in trouble 
[00:50:30]  but don't get  I'm always in trouble  don't have to be forced to resign  I'm not resigning  like the whole  the whole fucking  do something  so that they can get rid of you  right  that's what it is  I said don't even  I said don't even  fucking talk to me  about this  don't even talk to me  about it  simple as that  don't you have equipment  where you can just do  your own radio show  if you wanted to  his studio is better  than this shit  I'm gearing up  my friend  you're gonna get us in trouble  we gotta move on  I'm telling you  okay 
[00:51:00]  because I go on internet  I've pushed it a little too far  lately  and I just see things  on the internet  that different ways  that they're making me  see ads  things are blossoming  like they force me  to do ads  yeah  and I gotta X things out  but if it's a fake X  if I click that X  it really opens up something  you motherfuckers  don't you hate that  but they're tricky  with this shit now  they're not that nice to you  you're so right  when you go  oh I'm gonna skip the ad  because they're giving me  that option  that means that you just  entered a whole world  of hurt  that's why I'm 
[00:51:30]  they just got your credit card number  and they're fucking  charging things  that you don't even know about yet  I love that Apple  supposedly has no  no viruses  I think I have one on my  I think I found a way  to put a virus on  I'm pretty sure  because I got that  wheel of death  quite often  wow really  the one where it just  spinny spins  spins but it stops  but I get  spinny spin spin spin  it doesn't move much  you gotta force quit  spin spin  it's some things going on  Apple is a lion  it's not like it used to be  it ain't just like 
[00:52:00]  I could open up  any porn site  and fucking  yeah yeah  scum  like the old days  you're right  by the way  I got in trouble  and the guy  that I have to answer to  is in Africa  how do I get in trouble  and the guy's not even  on this continent  he's with Africans  and you're still  getting in trouble  yes  he's on a safari  for two weeks  and I'm in trouble  how the hell that happened  because god forbid  I'm here  god forbid  we're here  doing a show every day  we're getting in trouble  as we do our jobs 
[00:52:30]  from a guy  that's riding  a fucking elephant  on another continent  for the next two weeks  maybe something  terribly white  this place is insane  maybe something  maybe something  very true tv  oh true tv  vacation attacks  kind of things  I've never rooted  for a lion  more in my life  maybe chupacabra  will be showing  chupacabra  maybe a chimpanzee  that wants to rip  some testicles off  they love ripping 
[00:53:00]  testicles  I actually said  yesterday  I'm like  listen to yourself  you're trying to  hide the fact  that Howard's  now a part-timer  how is that  possible  all they have to do  is tune in his  channel and hear  a 20 year old  replay  and they know  oh he's not here  again  and like I said  I don't have a  problem with Howard  at all  we look at him  hoping that maybe  we get the holy grail  someday  it's not it's no  surprise when you  tune in and you  hear me on his  show  has that happened 
[00:53:30]  yeah  I don't think  anybody's thinking  hey check it out  Anthony's on  he'll be back I  think Monday  finally  oh yeah  yeah he'll do  six days in July  welcome back  welcome home  yeah he does  six shows in July  it was reported  nine and  you're gonna get  in trouble again  all right let's  move on  get it talking  to  yeah  if you talk  about chimps  let's talk about  this new planet  apes movie that  I want to see  badly  is there a 
[00:54:00]  previews out yet  remember the last  time we were all  psyched  they got us but I  don't think they're  gonna get us with  this one  no  you think they're  gonna get us  no  they fucked up  the last one  yeah  that was a  no-brainer to  make planet  apes cool  with marky mark  they fucked that  movie up so bad  how did they  fuck that up though  let me know  because you know  what can I just  say I'm  fuck what you say  guy for this week  oh okay  fuck what  everybody says  and I'm gonna  start out by  saying this  I there's three  other gangster  movies I'd rather  see than godfather 
[00:54:30]  okay and two  other vietnam movies  I'd rather see than  apocalypse now and  that those those are  the I know what  they are functioning  great movies  can we guess the  godfather movies  the three you would  rather see than  godfather  you could  good fellas  good fellas  that was obvious  casino  that was my second  and those are the  two  this one  those three  oh it's three  three gangsta movies  the third is the  tricky one right  no  Scarface  you might smack me  in the face  no  well  no  that's stereotypical 
[00:55:00]  what you did right  there  black people like  Scarface  they love  Scarface  okay  I'm dead serious  I've seen it  I've seen it  dead men don't wear  plaid  Donnie Brasco  Donnie Brasco  Donnie Brasco  that is a good one  and only  and I look  I'm not  I can't get into  a fucking  a theater discussion  with anybody  that's angry  but I  those three movies  I'd rather watch  first  even though I know  the godfather's great  right right  that's not shocking  but I'd rather watch  those three movies 
[00:55:30]  that's not shocking  though  but in terms of  people that tell you  what to fucking watch  and tell you what's good  I go  I like those three  better  entertainment value  I couldn't argue  that you didn't think  the scene  the way it  fucking flowed  through this  I didn't get it  I mean  I love it  I love the movie  but I'd rather watch  I'd rather watch  fucking casino  yeah  that's not too shocking  what was the other one  Donnie Brasco  no no  the other question  oh  Vietnam  come on  Platoon  easily 
[00:56:00]  yeah  easily  Platoon is great  and Full Metal Jacket  Full Metal Jacket  Platoon easily  I watch  10,000 times more  than I would watch  I watch Apocalypse Now  a hundred times  because  I think I'm supposed to  yeah  and I'm sitting there  and I'm going  oh Robert Duvall  yeah  I'm feeling it  oh fucking  Kornhauser  or whatever the fuck  his name is  Kirkenbauer  that Marlon Brando  but I go  I'm just like  eh  eh 
[00:56:30]  Charlie Sheen  Colonel Kurtz  eh  but I watch  Platoon  it's on cable  right  I watch it  every time it comes on  it's great  I don't get sick of it  and I don't get  I don't get tired  of saying  Sergeant Barnes  might be the best  character in a movie  ever  I just watched it  two days ago  and I was thinking  the same thing  I mean seriously  I can't  I'm watching  I'm watching them all  so I'm looking at  this Planet of the Apes movie  yeah 
[00:57:00]  okay here's what  I want to know  I want to know  movies that are  considered bad  I want to know  why Waterworld  was bad  I love Waterworld  I want to know  why  they told me  it was a shitty movie  and I watch it  every single time  it comes on  and I love it  why is it a bad movie  yeah  I can't answer that question  you tell me  cause I don't know  because I watch it  and I love Waterworld  I watch him  throw that little girl  in the water  Kevin Costner  is a complete asshole 
[00:57:30]  in that movie  he is  he chops their hair off  he won't fuck  ugly what's in the name  triple horn  and  and he leaves the island  yeah  on a fucking  worst ship  that he had  yeah on a horrible  little dinghy  he loves the ocean  he just loves it  it's a  it's a  I watch Waterworld  and I'm gonna tell you  something else  I watched it  they try to  tell me stunk  the postman  love the postman  really  he told me  the postman  suck  and I'm not  listening to him  no more  cause it's  Waterworld on the land 
[00:58:00]  I enjoyed  the postman  it's the same movie  on the land  I love that movie  love it  why did he tell me  that movie stunk  it's a great  subject today  what a great  bad guy  so  the guy  was great  I used to fix  copy machines  and now he's like  fucking kicking ass  taking names  dude  I'm sitting there  going  okay  you said  the first  the Planet 8  remake  was bad  yeah  why was it bad  why  it's not memorable 
[00:58:30]  cause I can't even  tell you one scene  from the movie anymore  now you got me thinking  but why is it bad  now you got me thinking  why  I think there were  high expectations  I think Marky Mark  took you out of the movie  a little bit  cause you're like  yeah that's Marky Mark  cause they went  off the original  they went completely  off the original  and we thought  it was gonna be  well that's a reboot though  yeah  they went for the reboot  made it really dark  that's all I can say  about it  I haven't seen the movie  in years  but do you see  how fast  you would say 
[00:59:00]  it stunk  yeah  true  but it's like  why did it stink  now I'm not gonna say  it was a great movie  we didn't give you  a good answer  I understand that  that's what I mean  so it's like  we will say some things  that come right out of  like we go  apocalypse now  is the standard  but I go  I'm not sure  you know  I would say it again  I think people had a problem  with Marky Mark  in that movie  really  yeah he was Marky Mark  they probably should have  went with some kind of  unknown  the apes were great  the apes looked alright  right  yeah they looked great 
[00:59:30]  I think though  if you remember  the trailer  was spectacular  oh yeah  that's true  it was  I think the trailer  was so good  it was  it was very hard  to live up to the trailer  but the trailer  for this new one  is phenomenal  it looks good  I haven't seen it yet  it's phenomenal  I gotta see this  fucking movie man  it does look good  I gotta tell you  I have a problem  with Marky Mark  in movies  Mark Wahlberg  yeah  because you go  once again  that's Marky Mark  Boogie Nights  it's fucking fantastic  Boogie Nights  not so much  because he changed 
[01:00:00]  his look enough  love Boogie Nights  in all the other movies  he made a deal  with the producers  that he wasn't  gonna cut his hair  or something  he had to have  his regular  Marky Wahlberg hair  Marky Mark  I think they're  looking for  a something  version of  Matt Damon  but Matt Damon  is the same  exact version  of Mark Wahlberg  but he makes  better choices  did they come out  about the same time  or was Marky Mark  doing movies  I just think  Matt Damon  did something  with himself  that he's  borderline  gets to do 
[01:00:30]  good movies  the same kind  of movies  that maybe  Johnny Depp  gets to do  but he's not  as involved  as Johnny Depp  but he's  really good  can I ask you  something  actors that  take you out  of movies  because they're  so fucking  famous  that you're  like oh  I'll say it  again  that's Marky Mark  you have a short  list of guys  like that  that are so  famous  or so bad  well  Travolta's  terrible  in everything  he's in  nobody's  that famous  for me  to go  no  where it's  tough for them  to play  a character 
[01:01:00]  because you  just know  the guy  so well  well that's  why I'm  saying  is there  a short  list of  actors  that will  do that  to you  I know  there's a  short list  of actors  another thing  I'm going to  do is stop  saying like  Jack Nicholson's  great  yeah  I'm watching  and I go  what's going  on here  this guy  is him  again  meaning  I'm not  going to  say he's  not a  great  him  but it's  him  all the  time  I wouldn't  say that  he's a 
[01:01:30]  I can't  say he's  a great  actor  I think  he's a  great  comfortable  guy on  film  wow this  looks badass  I haven't seen  this movie  this planet  of the fucking  apes  looks  if this  one sucks  go back  to the  beginning  of the  trailer  let's  give it  a listen  we love  watching  trailers  it's the  dumbest  thing to do  on radio  but we love  doing it  people can  play along  at home  get your  computer  god damn  look up  rise of  the  planet  of  the  apes  this does  look pretty  good  damn  good  because 
[01:02:00]  they  have  huge  potential  for millions  of people  our therapy  enables the  brain to  repair itself  you call it  the cure  I want you  to start  testing on  chimps  ASAP  we test  one subject  I want to  make sure  it's stable  I designed  the 112  for repair  but Caesar's  gone way  beyond that  you mean 
[01:02:30]  increased  intelligence  the skills  that far  exceed that  of a human  counterpart  it's a strong  world  it works  and what  about Caesar  where does  he fit in  that  chips  company  property  he doesn't  spend any  time with  other chips  oh shit  not people  you know  you're trying  to control  things that  are not  meant to  be controlled  oh shit 
[01:03:00]  yo  oh shit  got the cure  he's got the cure  he's giving it  to his buddies  they are  contaminated  put those  apes  down  you have  no idea  what you're  dealing with  oh man  that chimp  gave a nasty  ass look  slow turn  they bust out 
[01:03:30]  and they call  him the Caesar  yeah  the Caesar  the Caesar  Caesar  oh shit  they're  rioting  that's pretty  badass  now it's  just  thousands  we're  looking  this movie  looks  that looks  badass  spectacular  it really  looks  badass  I cannot  wait to 
[01:04:00]  see this  movie  that's right  around the  corner too  man  a couple  weeks away  August 5th  I can't  wait to  see that  movie  one piece  of suspension  of disbelief  gunless  apes  ain't  winning  that's all  I'm saying  it's just  gunless  apes  we will  what they  call  collateral  damage  through any  apes  with this  children in  the school  snake and  nape  snake and  nape the  fucking  bridge  gunless 
[01:04:30]  apes  there's apes  in the  wire  chips in the  wire  we will  fucking  light them  on my  paws  on my  paws  I take  full  responsibility  lovely  fucking  war  it looks  fucking  good  yeah  that's  gonna be  a great  one  but  green  lantern  looked  good  and  I  didn't  see it  dude  not good  dude  not good  and I  have the  same  funny  feeling  about  captain  america 
[01:05:00]  we just  talked to  the man  yeah  yeah  the  captain  america  guy  talked to  the  captain  america  he's  too  he's a  boston  guy  he's  boston  he's  white  bread  don't  know  those  two  guys  are  they're  two  finger  air gun  guys  they're  Ryan  Reynolds  was  in the  comic books  here's the  bad thing  about  what's  going on  with these  comic books  adults  are into  comics  children  now  are not  into  comic books  the way 
[01:05:30]  adults  are  some  father's  trying to  get his  goofy  son  to be  into  them  but  they  just  you're  right  wow  the paper  feels  funny  yeah  you know  and  you  you  think  of  heroes  that  would  be  good  on  on  on  television  and  like  Aquaman  would be  tremendous  yeah  if they did  a rated R  and they  they took  advantage  of the  abyss  really made  it fucking  crazy  the ocean  is creepy 
[01:06:00]  yeah  anything I see  about the ocean  scares the  and he  a man  lives in  the ocean  it has  to be  some kind  of  deep  dark  Aquaman  yeah  it can't  be  fun  fun  guy  it can't  be a guy  in the Bahamas  swims  like that  nice colored  water  yes  swimming  with the  steel drums  yeah  yeah  doing  like the  dolphin  dances  it has  to be  the creepiness  of the abyss  so you've  never went  scuba diving  I know  exactly what 
[01:06:30]  you're describing  that weirdness  the darkness  where you look  ahead and you  know there's  just darkness  for thousands  of miles  and there's a  fucking dude  living there  some shit  out there  you can't see  who communicates  with the lobsters  do you understand  like they  but they're gonna  fuck it up  because Aquaman  in theory  well I don't know  if they will  because they're  going dark  with a lot  of these superhero  movies  finally  no they're not  they kind of are  name one  besides the  great dark knight  one  dark  Mr. Captain America  told us that  that's gonna be  a bit dark 
[01:07:00]  really  he said not  it's more like  the Iron Man  though  tone  where it's got  a little bit  Iron Man was  kind of dark  Iron Man was  good but it  wasn't dark  there was a good  balance of  cartoony and  darkness  he even said  not dark  nightish  who in my  Iron Man was  dark  what part  you didn't  think so  not a drop  of darkness  the dark  night  the original  Batman  which I  have finally  come on  I used to say  Superman  1978  best  comic book  movie ever  made  the original  original  Christopher Reeve 
[01:07:30]  was stupendous  Batman Begins  took that over  for me  it's the best  it's better than  Dark Knight to me  only for this  when I was a kid  and watched Batman  I used to go  who built  the Batmobile  it was a suspension  of disbelief  who built the Batmobile  and who built  the Batcave  who built the  little thing  that little gate  that went down  under the stately  Wayne Manor  who built the  thing that you 
[01:08:00]  rip open the  head and push  the button  and you go  down  who did  that  Batman Begins  Alfred  Alfred would  fucking  know that shit  tip up that  fucking  that Morgan  Freeman character  who plays  Morgan Freeman  in every movie  who plays  Morgan Freeman  in every movie  you are speaking  for a couple  of crackers  out there  that said  fuck you  Jack Nicholson  but Morgan Freeman  is this  every character  I'm getting my  short list together  Morgan Freeman 
[01:08:30]  is him  I'd like to say  the sisters  never got to him  there's a few  great actors  it's a short list  of great actors  Robert De Niro  even though he's  been quite  fucking up lately  but he deserves it  young De Niro  is still the  greatest actor  I've ever seen  Raging Bull De Niro  is amazing  Denzel  is second  Denzel  Denzel has done  things where you go  that motherfucker  can act  I put up there 
[01:09:00]  maybe above all  this motherfucker  is so good  oh shit  Daniel Day-Lewis  really yeah  this cocksucker  where the fuck  has he been  he only does a movie  every ten years  and gets an Oscar  where the fuck  is he been  Gangs of New York  Gangs of New York  was fucking amazing  he's the only guy  he's the only  method actor  that I truly love  like a guy  who I could tell  sits on  fucking set  and he's that dude  the whole time  yeah don't try to  talk to Daniel Day-Lewis 
[01:09:30]  you're talking to  the butcher  that's the fucking guy  I think he's probably  he's probably  one of the great  great great actors  of all time  but in terms of  being real reality  I think De Niro  the shit he did  when he was good  when he played  Max Cady  the old days  Max Cady  was a great character  is tremendous  absolutely  and then  Denzel  in his glory cry  oh yeah  could be  the best 
[01:10:00]  I forgot how good  he was in glory  tremendous  actor man  so  there's a few  but I think  I don't put  Nicholson up there  Pacino  was pretty good  when he was not  over the top  Pacino  before over the top  Pacino  he was great  but he was not  see but he was  the same Pacino  before he became  over the top  Pacino  I don't know  he was this Pacino  he was this guy  no he was this guy  kind of just  in every movie  he didn't go  my father's business 
[01:10:30]  I'm gonna take it  legit  and then  yeah  even in The Godfather  he was that  for like  a little bit  till he became  when he yelled at  Kay for  getting the abortion  no no no  not over the top  the other guy  oh yeah  the quiet one  the quiet guy  he was that guy  for a minute  and then  Sin of a Woman  kind of took him  into  the hooah  the hooah  got him  now some guys  have great presence  you know  and that's  like 
[01:11:00]  Petchy  yeah yeah  Petchy  you know  he's doing him  but he has great  you know  this is just a fan  I'm just talking  as a fan of movies  and shit  yeah yeah  I mean  and actresses  I just say  there's only one actress  alive and that's  Meryl Streep  I mean  other than that  do I see  actresses be able  to be as  big as her  not really  I only like  Petchy  as that guy  I don't like  Petchy  in any other  fucking role  I mean  what has he done  that's not 
[01:11:30]  you don't even know  like Home Alone  in a comedy  but he was  I was good  in Home Alone  he was Petchy  though  yeah but I don't  he was good  in Home Alone  yeah but I like  him being that  you motherfucker  you Jew  motherfucker  that's the guy  but that's an  exception  to what you're  trying to say  I'm gonna take  your fucking head  I'm gonna stick  it through that  fucking hole  that shit  there's no one  better at doing  that guy  and being a  little dude  and he convinces  you that he  stabbed a giant  man in his neck  with a pencil  yeah 
[01:12:00]  fantastic  I knew this  was coming  both of you guys  liked Waterworld  and I can't argue  that point  because I don't  even remember  seeing Waterworld  I've seen it  many times  it's been way  too long  many times  but watching it  thinking this sucks  hold on  well with that  said Ace in  Pittsburgh is gonna  challenge you  Patrice  Ace  yes  Ace is high  good morning  first of all  I know I'm  walking into a  losing battle  with Patrice  not true  I'm open  you're tough  I'm open  you're tough 
[01:12:30]  in a debate  sir  I'm open  to seeing  why does  Waterworld  suck  right  right  let's hear it  well there is  there is an  inkling of hope  being that  Jimmy changed  his mind  on face-off  so I do  have a little  bit of hope  and by the way  just saw it  recently  I wanted  to tweet  after I watched  face-off  it is bad  Jimmy hit me  hard  it's so bad  and you know  what I realize  about face-off 
[01:13:00]  is that  John Woo  sometimes  you're painted  in a corner  about being you  and you wanna  grow  but you  you grow  but you can't  move on  from being you  you gotta do  the slow motion  two guns  in your hand  sideways  he was pretending  to be him  yes  directing that movie  right  and it even  got worse  as I watched it  it's bad  and Nicolas Cage  is another one  that plays  Nicolas Cage  in every movie 
[01:13:30]  and he's  over the top  we're getting  that short list  together  now we got  Marky Mark  Morgan Freeman  sorry  but he pulls  it off though  he's in the  Pesci zone  you watch Shawshank  come on  who else is  playing that role  in Shawshank  he's a Pesci role  he's that guy  he's amazing  as him  but he doesn't  change too much  he was even  greater than  Bruce Almighty  I'm saying  he pulls it  out  as God  Nicolas Cage  plays Nicolas Cage  in every  fucking movie  you get Nicolas Cage  every single time 
[01:14:00]  deep shit  he is doing  straight to  he's got to  take anything  bad movies  he's had a fall  Ace  did you explain  your waterwalk  thing  what you got  the Kevin Costner  thing kind of  goes along with  the Nicolas Cage  premise  he's the same  guy in every  movie nearly  he has no  emotion  he was the  waterwalk  guy in the  postman  but see  I'm gonna tell  you something  we're talking  movies  now you can't  when you look  Schwarzenegger  you go movie  for movie 
[01:14:30]  Schwarzenegger  is him  so you go  hey is  Running Man  good  is the  sixth  whatever  good  the sixth day  wasn't a great  film  Running Man  was an  all timer  to me  but they're  both just  Schwarzenegger  so we're  talking  Kevin  I'm just  throwing that  out there  right  but Schwarzenegger  will do bad  movies  then he'll do  good ones  Kevin Costner  who was  Kevin Costner  in the  Untouchables  which is  another  all timer 
[01:15:00]  that might  be another  gangster film  that I watched  before Godfather  that's a good  one  and I'll give  you credit  for that  so  if you're  a movie  fan  like a  real  like  snobby  movie buff  you're not  gonna like  movies like  Waterworld  that's the  problem sir  the problem  is  do you  like any  of the  Friday the  13th  like  I don't  like them  all  but I  love  three  so  it's like  it's about  what you  like  did you  like  dances 
[01:15:30]  with wolves  I could  not watch  it  I'm supposed  to watch  it  yeah  yeah  I  cannot  watch  two seconds  of that  fucking  I try  and try  but I'm  gonna tell you  what  there's a lot  of things  in movies  that I can't  recall right  now  but one  of them  that I  can't  stand  is  my  people  we will  be there  with our  people  any movie  where  Indians  are saying  my  people 
[01:16:00]  and that  my  people  they say  my  people  my  people  my  people  and there's  one  fucking  younger  one  that wants  to change  everything  and the  older  one  they  annoy me  yeah but  the fact  Kevin Costner  stunk  in Waterworld  is not a good  argument  I tell you  why man  the movie  in itself  Dennis Hopper  was very  entertaining  as the boss 
[01:16:30]  of the  worst people  in the world  and he  was good  as a  loner  guy  who lives  on  escapes  the smokers  fishes  for giant  sea monsters  when he's  hungry  fucking  can breathe  underwater  the idea  of that  movie  was pretty  fucking  matter of  fact  Waterworld  is close  to what  Aquaman  should be  let me ask  you this 
[01:17:00]  when he  gets to  the  Atoll  and the  Chinese guy  wants him  to mate  with his  daughter  and they  find out  he's a  mutant  and they  flip shit  that doesn't  make any  sense  you live  in a  world  filled  with  water  wouldn't  you want  to be  nice  to a  guy  that  can  breathe  underwater  in that  scene  sir  I will  be fair  I've seen  this movie  so many  times  and that's  one of  the scenes  that could  bother  you  but here's  the problem  with that  here's the  thing  about that  scene  they were  offended  anyway  they were 
[01:17:30]  looking for  any reason  to kill  this guy  right  because he  they were  dying  he said  that  you people  are dying  there's  nothing  and he  explained it  later  really why  he didn't  fuck the  girl  is because  he's never  been with  one  he's  some weird  mutant  with web  toes  so when  he said  no and  they wanted  to attack  him  it was  based on  them being  unreasonable  weirdos  but there  was the  guy who  was protecting  them  who said  you're not  gonna  do this 
[01:18:00]  like  he was  a reasonable  guy  he said  what are  you doing  they were  pissed off  that he  wouldn't  mate  with their  little  thing  that they  were offering  so the  suspension of  disbelief  I can see  where it  can take  you out  like what  the fuck  are they so  mad about  right  but  they're  weirdos  everybody's  fucking weirdos  they live on  water  they drink  their own piss  they love  ski boots  they want  ski boots  they just  wanted his 
[01:18:30]  ski boots  so this  fucking  weirdo  who  trust me  he was  a weirdo  because he  breathed  underwater  not everybody  mutated into  a half fish  half man  thing  that's how  he got  land  they were  like where  the fuck  are you  getting this  land from  actually the  guy that  looked like  he was  from  white snake  wanted the  fucking  boots  David Coverdale  wanted the  fucking boots  I wouldn't  even say  Waterworld  is a good  bad movie  I would say  I enjoy  Waterworld 
[01:19:00]  it was well  done  it's just that  people were  anti  Kevin Costner  at the time  I enjoyed the  exhibit at Disney  it was awesome  hey you know  something  that was great  those actors  were amazing  and the fucking  jet skis  that is great  they knew how  to work those  jet skis  that is great  hey so you done  with this  yeah you know  I came into  this argument  thinking I  would need  a plethora  if you will  of arguments  for you  I think  Patrice just  forced me  to watch  Waterworld  just cause 
[01:19:30]  he sucks  just cause  Kevin Costner  is stung  see if I  say that  I don't think  Jack Nicholson  is a fantastic  actor  he makes  fantastic movies  like he  if you  if you add  up 20  movies  20 actors  and you go  okay if I  was stuck  which actor  would I  take his  collection  of films  and be  stuck  with  for the rest  of my life  I say  Schwarzenegger  and then  but you can  easily say  Jack Nicholson  if you're  a real  movie fan  he has 
[01:20:00]  such a  wide range  of shit  you can watch  I mean  he's amazing  De Niro  De Niro  De Niro  did a couple  good comedies  and he's got  the gangster  stuff  he's all  over the place  I mean  Midnight Rock  is the best  comedy I've  ever seen  I think  it's still  one of the  best movies  I've ever seen  he was so good  a bunch of  people want to  add Gene Hackman  to the list  he plays  Gene Hackman  every time  I know  he's phenomenal  I'm not saying  that this means 
[01:20:30]  they're hacky  what's the one  him and Denzel  did  in the submarine  and I hate  clothes  movies  come on  here it is  come on people  where is it  the submarine  movie  Red October  no that was  the other one  Grey Lady  Crimson Tide  Crimson Tide  thank you  Adam  his exchange  they just  I love  Gene Hackman  as Gene Hackman  like even in 
[01:21:00]  Superman  original Superman  it just was  I think he's  a phenomenal  dude  oh fuck man  forgot about that  he was great  as Lex Luthor  Mr. Luthor  great as Lex Luthor  Mr. Luthor  I got another one  that saves face  even in bad movies  because he's so damn good  but he plays himself  in every movie  Robert Duvall  really  I would  I would say  Robert Duvall  phenomenal  and I'm not saying  that means he's a bad actor  but he definitely plays  Robert Duvall  in just about every movie  colors he was 
[01:21:30]  Robert Duvall  and even in  the shittiest movie  where he has a cameo  he does his part  to perfection  every fucking time  let me think of that  for just a second  let me  let me say  I'm not sure  De Niro  might be  the greatest  I'm gonna put him  as the greatest  from his  you know  to recall  some of the shit  but the  the Russian roulette scene  in the Deer Hunter  oh my god  is the greatest  scene  I've ever seen  in a movie  that fucking scene  when he's just 
[01:22:00]  telling him to do it  Nicky  come on  show these motherfuckers  that is some of the  best acting  and he goes  he looks at the  at the guy  the fucking  VC  and goes  oh you  his  his frustration  of wanting to  kill this guy  is  there's nothing  better  this  oh  his face  he fucking  shows with his  face  the hate  it's even on 
[01:22:30]  fucking walking  the deer hunter  walking became  a different entity  walking just  became a different  person  come on  he's not that  guy  he's fuckers  he's fuckers  go ahead Nicky  go ahead Nicky  it's gonna be  alright  it's gonna be  alright  go ahead  go ahead  yeah  and they're  laughing at him  didn't you hate  these fucking

[01:24:00]  that they're  in the middle  of fucking  nowhere  like with  this shit  going on  he just  starts smiling  at him  he's just  smiling at  him  throws the gun  down  I do  130 round 
[01:24:30]  banana clip  and walking  and walking  so pathetic  in this man  as we all  would be  of course  like De Niro  the fucking  man in this  right here  ouch  he's like  oh  god damn it  it's gonna be  alright  Nicky  go ahead  shoot  oh

[01:31:30]  to revisit  after the break  we might have  to revisit  because it's  just way too  funny  I didn't realize  that scene  was in that  movie  can I apologize  not that I'm  proud of it  I just can't  I would never  ask you for an  apology  except for this  situation  that one's a  little rough  do I have to  hug all people  that fucking  love Rachel  I have to  apologize  you might have  to do a Tracy  Morgan and  apologize to  everybody  Frank Vincent  in it  please don't  convince me  that it's great  it's like if 
[01:32:00]  somebody said  they don't like  Jaws  I would be  very bothered  by that  but I  didn't say  I didn't like  it  I don't know  how to watch  it  that's another  one  hold on  fucking Robert  Shaw in Jaws  when he gives  that speech  what do you  think  amazing  the one  where he  tells about  the fucking  the Hiroshima  yeah yeah  tells about  that is  that prop  for me  Indianapolis  I would probably  say it probably  would be in the 
[01:32:30]  top ten  all time  but I  I like the  scene  where he  I'm a sucker  in movies  for the scene  where the person  explains  the evil  in the movie  when he scratches  the board  and he's like  you know  oh that's a great  y'all know me  that to me  is better  than the one  on the boat  I know people  would probably  tell me  but when he  explains that  this fish  will swallow  you whole  it costs 
[01:33:00]  ten thousand  dollars to  fuck with  this fish  this punk  ass two  you getting  that'll help  I'll point you  at that  motherfucker  and say  there it is  down you go  so if you  want your  fucking  that scene  is phenomenal  that's a good  one  yeah I like  that one too  that's a good  argument  when he leaves  that is a great  scene  mayor  chief  ladies  gentlemen  and then he  just walks out  and he's just  driving his boat  around watching  him off  just liver  really you  caught that  tiger shot  go fuck  yourself  that was 
[01:33:30]  eating children  that ain't the  motherfucker  yeah he just  drives by like  looking at them  all patting themselves  on the back  he's pleasure  boning  everyone else  thinks they're  catching the  monster  you think  that kid  yeah  not everybody  you know  but I'm not  saying  you don't have  to convince me  about Rachel  Bull  I just  recently  sat  and absorbed  Rocky  I used to say  Rocky 3  was better  than the original 
[01:34:00]  I'm entertained  by Rocky 3  but Rocky  is a great  film  Rocky as a story  is great  as an action  movie  and with a little  more of a cartoony  character thing  with Mr. T  you can't fucking  be 3  Mr. T in 3  that was the best  thing he's ever  done  not that he's  done all genius  shit  which is  he may be  and if you're  talking villains  he could be in  the top 10  villains of all  time  that was a great  fucking bad  guy  he was brutal 
[01:34:30]  hey woman  hey woman  won't you come  by  I'm gonna fuck  your wife Rocky  real man  he's like  right in front  of the public  the beloved Rocky  in his own  fucking city  and he's  saying he's  gonna fuck  his wife  the truth is  we both  started out  on the same  corner  and I got  lucky with  my life  and it's  driving you  nuts  Philadelphia  salutes  it's  favorite  son  Rocky  Balboa  they get  the statue  and it  missed a team  he was leaning  in  you know  you've got  a big mouth 
[01:35:00]  the whole  world was  scared  come on  Balboa  was a fine  champion  but his time  has passed  see that look  in their eyes  Rocky  gotta get that  look back  Rocky  yeah  I'm the tiger  come on  I'm the tiger  destroy any man  who tries to  teach what I  got  oh yeah  I'm gonna  touch him  I'm gonna  crucify him  basically  Tyson  Tyson  why not  why not  there's nothing  wrong with being 
[01:35:30]  afraid  you thought  I was tough  this job  will kill you  you wake up  after a few  years  taking your  winner  but you're  not  there is  no tomorrow  you're really  loose  well I don't  believe it  there is  no tomorrow  tomorrow  oh shit  ding ding  ding  that's how  they all  start  you gotta  get the  bell  come on  yeah  yeah Rocky  you're kicking  ass now  fuck that  clever  line  it's Rocky's 
[01:36:00]  greatest challenge  his marriage  and his manhood  against his most  devastating and  dangerous opponent  go for it  go for it  Sylvester Stallone  Talia Shire  Burgess Meredith  Carl Weathers  Burt Young  and introducing  Mr. T  introducing  Rocky 3  an American  tradition  look  yeah 
[01:36:30]  that was great  Mr. T was so good  I rooted for Rocky  yeah  can I tell you something  that stupid music  to this day  gives me the goosebumps  what's the best scene  what the fuck  in all 12 movies  the best scene  oh shit  in all of them  I got mine  not even a challenge  that's a tough one  I'd have to think  I was thinking  I won't stop fighting 
[01:37:00]  come here  come here Rocky  I was thinking  I won't fight  no boy  you know  cause you're sick  come here  win  what are you waiting for  it's so corny  but it hits me  every time  like there you go  bitch  let him get his shit  together  I think it's in  every movie  when they go through  the montage  the workout montage  and then it ends  with the  and the music 
[01:37:30]  and you're like  here comes  here comes the fight  but the movie  has a tell  he doesn't get  his shit together  until that music  starts  you think  he might have  his shit together  but nope  the music  hasn't started yet  so he still  has to figure out  a couple more things  the Rocky music  don't confuse  getting  going stronger  right right right  with  ding  no  ding  that's when it goes  yeah  that's a different  ding ding ding  music  that's the fucking 
[01:38:00]  like crazy  alright there's gonna be  some fucking ass kicking  and Burgess Meredith  was just great  in those movies  how many did he  which one did he die  in three  he died in three  three right  yeah fucking  fucking Mr. T  killed the motherfucker  which we talked  about years ago  how Rocky's  crying in three  you should have  laughed at it  but  you couldn't  understand a word  he was fucking saying  I think he was real 
[01:38:30]  but he was upset  because he's like  I'm gonna do seven  more movies  but Mickey's dead  how can you kill  Mickey  and it was real  because you know  Burgess Meredith  didn't have many  years left  to begin with  and now you're  killing him off  in this great  fucking series  you was gonna  plug something  what was you  looking at  for me  oh no  no I wanted  to make sure  you get a plug  and we were  gonna go to break  ten minutes ago  we should break  soon  I got  there's something  I'm supposed  oh two things  three things  quickly  locally I'm at

[01:47:30]  she said a couple  of like  speaking two  language of the  thumb  tribute to Jimmy  a couple movie  roles that I can't  even remember  she looks so  so Asian too  she looks like  she probably  has an awful  accent  oh yeah  and you got  Dwight Gooden  and the story  with Dwight Gooden  didn't Lenny  who looks like  who looks like  Keith David  by the way  oh my god  yeah  he looks like  Keith David  get us some  of this sideways  pussy  woo  there's a story  about Dwight Gooden  I think  was it Lenny Dykstra 
[01:48:00]  trying to like  break him out  of the celebrity  rehab  because he  he thought that  there was  he was being  held  against his will  oh Jesus  was it Lenny Dykstra  or someone out there  who knows more  than I  about this dumb show  wow  fucking Dwight Gooden  what happened  to the doc  doc Gooden  and who's  Jeremy Jackson  he's the kid  who was on Baywatch  oh wasn't he also  in that show  where they were  supposed to bring  back child stars  no the child star  one where they  were bringing him  back and making  him famous again  yep  he was in that show  and the guy from 
[01:48:30]  Blue Lagoon one  or something  Chris Atkins  and I thought  he was supposed  to be famous again  because he won  the show  and we haven't  heard from him  since the show  exactly  he's doing  chiller theater  all right  who else  Jessica Sugar  Kiper  or Kipper  she was on  Survivor  I don't know  Michael Lohan  Sean Young  Steven Adler  is that what she  looks like now  Sean Young  yeah  she looks pretty good  she kind of  looks the same  yeah  at least she's  recognizable  as Sean Young  that's her all  dollied up  I've seen photos 
[01:49:00]  of her  she's  yeah  she's had a  rough few years  yeah  so Celebrity Rehab  has started again  I don't even know  why this show  should be allowed  to be on TV  and look at Dr. Drew  looking all pensive  yeah  Dr. Drew Pensive  they should call him  huh  well we bring this  up today  because he had  another success story  Rodney King  who was on season 2  relapsed  DUI  did a million things  wrong while he was  drunk driving  really 
[01:49:30]  oh yeah  this is the same  thing as the fat shows  it's like  yeah  they all go back  to being fat  because it's not  even really helping  it's like Dr. Drew  he's just not  it's a freak show  it's a perp walk  if a real doctor  had his fucking  his percentage rate  he would be  disbarred  would you pay  to go see this  motherfucker  he'd be disbarred  I don't know  people are gonna  jump on you  yeah he would be  thrown out  with his deep  thought picture  he'd be drummed  out of the regimen  what happened  to Dr. Drew 
[01:50:00]  he wants to be  and he is  he wants to be famous  yeah  to the point  where he doesn't  give a fuck  he didn't care  about a doctor  that he has  all these horrible  success stories  what kind of doctor  is he  is he a doctor  of psychology  he's an addiction  specialist  alright look  that doesn't mean  shit  how about he drops  the specialist part  and that don't mean  shit  but he used to do  he used to do  love line  with him  yeah with Adam  so he's an  addiction specialist  that's his expertise  at least Dr. Oz  is doing doctor  shit  like  oh yeah  I can't watch that 
[01:50:30]  though  I think I have it  I don't think  you should be able  to have a doctor  of psychology  I just don't think  no he's an internist  oh so he could  cut you open  and do some shit  I guess so  not like Dr. William H. Cosby  Jr.  that honorary doctorate  Dr. William H. Cosby  loves putting that doctor  in front of his name  that's like  I don't think  a doctor of psychology  is  I don't  it's just like  yeah there are some people  you should be able  to sue a psychologist  no one should be  able to be 
[01:51:00]  an honorary  it's a malpractice  but no one should be able  to be an honorary doctor  no it's like being  an honorary fucking general  if Bill can't do that  you can't go in the army  and go  hey by the way  I'm going to be a captain  if Bill Cosby  wants to be an honorary doctor  they should make him  perform a little minor surgery  or just call it  a little thing  call it  honorary Dr. Cosby  right  honorary Dr. Cosby  William H. Cosby  because now he's confused  with the real doctors  that spend  yes  I got a nephew  that's going into that crap  yeah  he explained to me  he's not even going to  start making money  until he's like  32 I think he said 
[01:51:30]  when he becomes a specialist  yeah  he's going to be  he's going to run around  and really be an assistant  to doctors  yeah  yeah he told me  his schedule  it's unbelievable  and the amount of money  they make is nothing  he's already done  the four years of college  now he's in medical school  that's another four to six  I think  then after that  he becomes an intern  for four years  or something like that  which is worse than an intern  for this show  oh yeah  well we wouldn't know  we don't have them  they work 70 to 80 hours a week  but they work the shit out of them  and make no money  and it's horrible  and then eventually  it's all the bad shit 
[01:52:00]  even at the 32 year old thing  or whatever it is  it's somewhere around there  whatever that age  that's not a guarantee  no  like they'll make  200 something thousand  or 300  like that's really good  yeah  but when you're talking  the money that people  think doctors make  right  you're talking about a guy  that fucking  sows new hearts  to your chest  to your chest  oh chest  cuts your head open  you know  the fucking specialists  get mega money 
[01:52:30]  and the big money now  is plastic surgery  right  the biggest money  it's not even healing  and helping  and what about the bills  from medical school  and all that  all the student loans  and all that  you're working for the  fucking university  and then the fucking  malpractice insurance  these motherfuckers  have to pay  right  it's a huge amount  but Dr. Drew doesn't  have to pay malpractice  why would he have to  well for psychology  I think a dentist  can be called a doctor  cause he can do something  that you can sue  yeah oral surgery  yeah  you can come out  with a fucked up grill  and fucking sue that 
[01:53:00]  motherfucker  let's do this  let's do this quick  my uncle touched me funny  he's like really  did you  really you get paid for that  here's the success  success stories  of celebrity rehab  and Dr. Drew  so you know  riding the Rodney King thing  which happened yesterday  or the day before  he was from season 2  and all these guys  graduated  Dr. Drew has a  graduation ceremony  oh is it really  you're cured  going to the real world  what does he give him  I don't know  does he give him a chip  or something  a little  I think a certificate  a certificate  or something  that they completed 
[01:53:30]  the program  some of those  he fucking snort coke  with it  they completed  the three weeks  roll it up  roll it up  dude fucking  mega rails  that's what that  damn Tommy Sizemore  did  he's on the same  and then poor  Jeff  what's his name  Conway  that motherfucker  was  Dr. Drew  should be sued  to Jeff Conway  some of the people  on that list  also went through  sober house  it's not mentioned  but not only  did they go through  but he shouldn't have  graduation ceremonies  or nothing  they survived 
[01:54:00]  a three week TV show  what about all the  success stories  alright here's the  success stories  and I know a bunch  of people  that aren't  on this list  great  like Dennis Rodman  is a partying animal  yeah we just didn't  have any specific  references  but he hasn't  done anything wrong  exactly  okay so  Shifty  season one  graduated from  celebrity rehab  did a little  sober house too  I remember  right  Shifty  who's Shifty  he's that  come my lady  come come my lady  yeah  butterfly  sugar  why would you say  that as we all

[01:55:00]  yeah  and I ain't gonna  lie  cause your lip  gets me high  so to keep you  by my side  this is a 90s song  yeah  yeah  that's that white  hip hop shit  and they got booed  off the stage  at what was it  Ozfest or something  really  yeah  and the weak guy  there is Shifty  probably why he  fucking turned to dope  he shifted  yeah  after he went  through the  graduation ceremony  of celebrity rehab  he relapsed  multiple times  arrested for  domestic  disturbance  success story  number two 
[01:55:30]  for Dr. Drew  is good old  Steven Adler  Steven Adler  season two and five  we've had him  on the show  he looked great  for a little while  there  still in celebrity rehab  Jesus  and got high  on television  when was that  I was in Sober House  oh yeah  when he was supposed  to be sober  in this  oh when he was  all fucked up  after graduation  yeah  was that when he was  banging into the walls  and shit  yeah  yeah  he was fucked up  so that's  success story number two  number three  is China  season one  started a legit  career in porn  hospitalized after  ODing on sleeping  pills  this is after

[02:07:00]  Johnny Weissmiller  man  the Tarzan guys  were the worst  maybe  who was the  fitness regimen  wasn't out then  it wasn't  it was like  calisthenics  they do like  Jack LaLanne  maybe Christopher Reeve  from the first  Superman  maybe that was  the first guy  is it that  fucking fart  he's got the start  he's got the start  of bitch tits  that's because  everything he ate  was fattening  everything  even apples  were fattening  there wasn't a  health regimen  I don't think 
[02:07:30]  no  no man  they were all  smoking  they were all  drinking  they were all  eating like shit  dude  who was the  first motherfucker  milk poured  like jello  are you kidding me  you have to go  to the 70s  Christopher Reeve  before you get  Superman 1978  dude you gotta go  to the 70s  before you get  a really in shape  star  I said early 70s  I'm guessing  come on  Smokey and the Bandit  shut up  what about  Charles Brunson  Charles Brunson  Charles Brunson  had that same body too  oh that awful  yeah that same  fucking  even the Great Escape 
[02:08:00]  he had that  it was an awful  it was just the  fucking in shape  out of shape  Christopher Reeve  could be the guy  that started it  the first dude  he could  what year  78  78  yeah  I'm reading this  I don't see shit  alright at least  we got  you can't put  Bruce Lee  in that category  we got Christopher  Reeve in 78  wait a minute though  why not  why can't you  cause before the movies  he was already  a badass  he was some  he was  that's what he did  but so was it  Johnny Weissmiller  Johnny Weissmiller  was a  but he was 
[02:08:30]  I don't know  it's  they got him  late in his career  who got  like  I see what you're  saying  I'm trying to get  you can't say  what about  Telly Savalas  Telly Savalas  Lee Majors  they all had  that same  fucking body  I think  Christopher Reeve  might be the first  that's hilarious  the first  legitimately  in shape  person  that's at least  a starting point  so now we gotta  move backwards  from 78  who would it be  there's  Telly Savalas  look at  Telly Fett Savalas  his dumb publicist  thought it was a good  idea to get him on  the cover of People 
[02:09:00]  without a shirt  they were unhealthy  you and Brenna's  last thing in life  was don't  just don't smoke  they smoked  they ate pork sandwiches  hey  hey hey  yeah  Sylvester Stallone  we're not thinking of  so now we're moving  backwards  time out  was that before  that was after  Superman  it was  or no  wait a minute  Rocky  I'm gonna tell you  I'm watching these movies  he didn't get in shape  till  three  look at Rocky's body 
[02:09:30]  in one and two  let's take a look  let's go to the video  he was a fat man  in one and two  he had a dollar  Creed was ripped  but  Creed was ripped  Creed was ripped  but do we count  fucking Carl Weathers  black guys  Carl Weathers  you fucking asshole  what a dick  look at him  in Rocky 1  borderline chubby  what about  Sidney Poitier  if we're gonna  go black guys  they never let  Sidney Poitier 
[02:10:00]  take his shirt off  Carl Weathers  was the first  half nude black man  we ever seen  you know why  with Sidney  Sidney Poitier  he had a third nipple  did he  did he really  I think you're lying  go to regular Rocky  just regular Rocky body  that's Rocky  that's not one  that's almost two  cause his body  starting to build up  that could be the  rematch  or something  Rocky  yeah put in  topless Rocky  pictures please  just put in  topless  is that the  original right there  Rocky  middle of the screen 
[02:10:30]  yeah well  he's ripped  in that  that was a little  later  yeah cause he had  the heavy sweatsuit  on so you might  yeah yeah  I think you're  onto something  you're onto something  yeah he was not  if he thought his  body was in shape  he would have  filmed those scenes  with something a little  dude a lot of  people stop saying  Arnold Schwarzenegger  we discussed that  he was a bodybuilder  that they found  and said let's put  this animal in a movie  he was like bodybuilding  to movie  not in shape guy  actor  they gave him the parts  because he was so  muscle bound  you know what  we can't go much 
[02:11:00]  further back  from 78  and Christopher Reeve  Christopher Reeve  is the first  in shape guy  in the movies  no and Stallone  wasn't a bodybuilder  the fucking  and Stallone  don't argue with me  also he didn't get  in shape  he was an in shape  guy  after Rocky 3  he also did  other movies  he did the fucking  outsiders  or whatever the fuck  he did  Stallone  he was in  yeah  Stallone was  he was in  Death Race 2000  with 
[02:11:30]  he was in  movies before  Rocky also  yeah yeah  John in Greensboro  just writes  this is so gay  it is super gay  I was thinking about it  but still  Joe for Turbo  what are you gonna do  but you see these  in shape  out of shape guys  and you laugh  it is funny  what about Clint Eastwood  nah I think he was also  I think he never was  he never was that dude  he was a skinny guy  at one point  can we be fair  is any  other than Schwarzenegger  even now  who's in shape  you look at someone  like Christian Bale 
[02:12:00]  when he was fucking Batman  he fucking worked  like a motherfucker  let's not  let's not forget  about Brad Pitt  Brad Pitt  I mean come on  that guy worked out  like a motherfucker  I mean not to be gay  I know  I'm not being gay here  I'm strictly saying  as a guy that fucking  works out  like how do you fucking  that Christian Bale  that certainly is a  that guy can work out  and get results  that is  that certainly isn't  Robert Mitchum  and then he did that 
[02:12:30]  fucking role  the machinist  and then he comes back  and does Batman  but you know what  I give no one credit  who does that  yeah  except for De Niro  yeah  I refuse to give credit  to anybody  who does  I'm gonna fucking  throw up  and not eat  thing  it's much harder  to do what he did  and go down  to that  wait for machinist  I don't get  the machinist  it's terrible  I read somewhere  he was eating like  one apple a day  or something  just insane shit  De Niro  he did it twice 
[02:13:00]  but who can't  Max Cady  who can't eat pasta  every day  to gain the weight  he gained it  and he lost it  but he did lose it  and he got fucking  pretty ripped after that  for Max Cady  for fucking Cape Fear  yeah Cape Fear  he had a fucking six pack  he's the king of that shit  hey let's get back  to the success stories  as we move through this  look at us  we fucking took a left turn  that's all good man  Jason Davis  who's Jason Davis again  he was on season four 
[02:13:30]  socialite  he was the guy  that Dr. Drew  basically said  you will die soon  if you do not get sober  wow  well he relapsed  and arrested  on possession  who is he  since the show ended  he's a socialite  he used to hang with  what Paris Hilton  and all that  that crew  he's famous for just  being in Hollywood  he looks like  Rocket's Red Glare  yeah  Ronnie King we said  Tawny Katan  or Katan  season two  relapsed DUI  Tony Katan  who's that  Katan  she was in 
[02:14:00]  White Snake  White Snake Video  going out with David  Coverdale  rolling around  on the hood of that car  okay  Mindy McCready  season three  big country  country star there  right  yes  relapsed  hospitalized  after drug overdose  put out a sex tape  these are all  Dr. Drew's success stories  who gets to fucking  confront this guy  we're the only ones  I swear to god  I'm surprised  no one else is jumping on this  because this is  I know  this is kind of like  the dead wrestler thing  we do  this is like  very suspicious  he's not helping anyone 
[02:14:30]  but what about like  if this guy was a real doctor  yeah he'd be fucked  you look at his resume  right  and you go  this guy died  this guy got  what are you doing  right  if you were like a surgeon  and lost this many people  yeah  then you got  in the last year  Jeff Conway  and Mike Starr  from Alice in Chains  both dead  maybe  and they also  graduated from  these shows  maybe it's like  a bus driver  he takes you 
[02:15:00]  on a ride  that he's supposed  to take you on  oh you get off  you get off  like he kept you  like he doesn't  he's not responsible  for you  after you leave  but you think  it would be bad  for business  when the fame  goes away  like what are you doing  so which means  I think he cares more  about being famous  than his practice  and Mike Starr  just to add  they brought  he was such a real  success story  for Dr. Drew  they brought him back  to show the other  losers  look you can change  your life  here's Mike Starr 
[02:15:30]  and they're all like  oh my god Mike  you look great  blah blah blah  and I think  six to eight months  later he was dead  did y'all talk about  that asshole  who got caught  cheating on his wife  y'all had to talk  about it  which one  there's been so many  I'm a day late  in the dollar show  that I know  but um  fucking  Catch a Predator  oh  right right  right  you discussed that  didn't you  yeah yeah  Chris Hanson  alright good enough  Chris Hanson  that motherfucker  can you believe him  they set him up  pretty good 
[02:16:00]  god bless him  I have a  yeah  we did the whole break  but I had a problem  with him  because he went  past that  Catch a Predator shit  which I thought  was a great show  I really thought  it was getting  some shit done  and then he went  into like  just harassing  bike owners  and like  just street guys  that are trying  to fucking  make a little  living here and there  who gives a shit  type of crimes  because he couldn't  do the Predator  thing anymore  because some guy  fucking hung himself  or some shit  and uh  they were like  we're liable  you know  networks  we're gonna get sued 
[02:16:30]  because the pedophile  hung himself  I saw one recently  I'll be quick  he uh  he's going after  bike owners  because what happens  is you know  you got street thieves  that taking your bike  and they go to a bike shop  and go hey man  what can you give me  for this bike  and a bunch of guys  are saying  well I'll give you  a couple hundred bucks  whatever  he went to this one  he got relegated to  he went to this  yeah  he went to this  one bike owner  with a fake stolen bike  and the bike owner  I'm telling you  you're saying  bike shop owner  a bike shop owner  I'm sorry  bike shop owner  told Chris Hansen 
[02:17:00]  I don't even know  how many times  no no  I'm not that guy  I don't want to do this  no thank you  you gotta go somewhere else  do you know of anyone else  no no no  doesn't want to be involved  with this fucking thing  and Chris Hansen  and the crew  just broke him down  and kept boom  boom boom boom  to the point where the guy  almost was like  alright I'll fucking  take your bike  and then as soon as  the guy said that  boom here comes  Chris Hansen  and big burly security guards  and they're beating  the shit out of this guy  you know mentally  basically for being  a bad guy  it was complete  entrapment  Hansen kept at him 
[02:17:30]  until he finally said  alright I'll take your bike  and there's no one  talking about that  what constitutes  like you would think  the hypocrisy  would get this motherfucker  and he's  no one's talking about it  it's just a non-issue  like who makes those decisions  on what the fuck  is like Kaylee  Tiger and shit like that  got fucking crucified  there was a time  I think a mother  who drowns  in succession of age  all her kids 
[02:18:00]  in the bathtub  is  that's warrant  like Kaylee  that case  I mean not that  it shouldn't be a case  but it  it permeated  throughout everything  and this fucking woman  who fucking drowns  all her kids  is not  the biggest news  since OJ  yeah  just drowns them  in order of the age  are you talking about  the one  oh  in Texas  all the many  white women  that fucking kill 
[02:18:30]  their kids  yeah  white women love  killing their children  they really do  we had one  close to New York  right  wasn't it a black woman  and she let the one go  why wasn't that  all over TV  I wanna know why  that's way more  fucking tragic  what did this girl  I think it's her attitude  where  you know  like again  they were so upset  that this girl  didn't act up  upset the way  she was supposed  to act upset  yeah yeah  you know  it's like  she's supposed to be  this apologetically  crazy  contrived 
[02:19:00]  sadness  and overwhelmed  she just sat there  look man  it's simple  she was  she is  young  white  and hot  and that's why  everyone  went with it  and that ugly  Nancy Grace  oh we got the Nancy Grace  we hate the Nancy Grace  we got the Nancy Grace  she  and she's ugly  with  you know what  her ugliness to me is  yeah  it's a  it's an inner ugly  it's an inner  that comes right  on her face  now did you see  the devil's advocate 
[02:19:30]  yeah of course  oh yeah yeah yeah  you remember when  when um  Charlize Theron  kept seeing  the faces  when they went shopping  the first time  and they're drinking  the champagne  and they're trying  on clothes  and then they were like  it was like  hey wait  she just got a glimpse  of their  their inner evil  Nancy's aura  is that to me  yeah yeah  she got a nasty aura  dude  something nasty  about that woman  you know  just because  we got a guest here  and it's getting crazy  so I want to rush  through this a little bit  we got two Nancy Grace  clips I want to play 
[02:20:00]  yeah yeah please  she's getting a lot of shit  because of the coverage  she had on HLN  she was trying to get  tot mom  to catch on  she explains why  she talked  named Casey Anthony  tot mom  tot mom  because she was trying  to make it her own  fucking cunt  and I've been  I've been battling  some people on Twitter  because I said  that Nancy Grace  loves the fact  that she was found innocent  it's great for her business  it's great for Nancy Grace  that this broad  was found innocent  so she could keep going  yes  Rush Limbaugh 
[02:20:30]  loves the fact  Obama's president  and I bet you  would love to see him  get another term  because it's great  for Rush's business  yeah  and you write this shit  on Twitter  and people think  you're a lunafucking tick  lunafucking tick  but this is the truth  Nancy Grace  wants this shit  to happen  Nancy Grace  wants another  young  white child  to go missing  yep  she absolutely  wants that  that  her show  what's her business  yes  her show  beat O'Reilly's show 
[02:21:00]  one night  and that never happens  in cable  on HLN  fucking headline news  right  where that's like  the CNN dumping grounds  and they actually  beat  fucking  the number one  cable talk show  because of  that trial  because then  she knew it  Nancy Grace  isn't attached  to these stories  so she wants  this shit  to happen  yes  because then  it's good  for her  fucking TV show  partying  young broad  fucking  smothers a kid  and we'll take  that one  right  because you know  she gets some  look man  I walk  in rest stops 
[02:21:30]  when you're driving  from gigs  yeah  they have  on the  it's like  the post office  now of missing  kids man  at these rest stop  things  there's so many  missing children  yeah  that she has  to actually go  oh this one  yeah  that's a good one  that's a good one  ooh that one  let me grab that  it can't be a matter  of I care  because it should be  30 segments of  this child's missing  see if you can find her  this child's missing  see if you can find her  you know what I'm saying  yeah yeah  well  here  she went on O'Reilly  she went on O'Reilly  isn't that the competition 
[02:22:00]  but I guess O'Reilly  it's good for O'Reilly's  business to have  Nancy Grace on  see how this shit works  yeah  yeah  they all just  fucking  are whores  incestuous  each other  yeah  I know I'm right  on this one  so stop yelling  at me on Twitter  it's good for her business  that Casey Anthony  was found innocent  she'll never admit that to you  yeah  but it's a fact  with us now  from Atlanta  is Nancy Grace  first of all  do you think you went  overboard at all  in your coverage of the trial  you know  Bill number one 
[02:22:30]  thank you for having me  but overboard  when there is a  miscarriage of justice  no I don't think  I went  overboard  and in fact  I think that term  overboard  is very trite  what I think  went wrong  is not me  commenting  or covering  what happened  in the courtroom  but what went wrong  is the jury verdict  now listen  I respect  our justice system  I have dedicated  my life  to our justice system  since my fiance  was murdered  back in 1979 
[02:23:00]  sometimes working  three and four jobs  at a time  so I could seek  justice in the courtroom  as a prosecutor  what is  overboard  is the jury  verdict  okay  so she's saying  fuck  this was killing me  she's saying  fuck the system  fuck the system  the system's wrong  because I say  it was wrong  but the system  did it's job  absolutely did  what it was supposed  to do  the prosecution  did not fucking  prove beyond  a reasonable doubt  that she did anything 
[02:23:30]  I don't understand  they didn't do it  I don't like  unreasonable  unreasonable  bothers me a lot  man  like that  it's like  wait a minute  I know  if something  happens to my mother  and then  someone gets away  you know  you're just  you're just  fucking soaked  with anger  yeah yeah yeah  resentment  you're gonna be  unreasonable I think  yeah  but then  it's personal  something  you go  it is the justice  it's the system  and you know  how many fucking  innocent people  are in jail 
[02:24:00]  where the system  doesn't work  either way  now Kate  now here's the thing  here's the thing  that you can't argue  I think one of the  jurors said  I don't think  she  I think she did  the shit  but our  our whole thing  from when we was  watching Beretta  12 angry men  is  reasonable now  reasonable now  if you got one  little thing  that can say  I didn't do it  then I didn't do it  a little I didn't do it 
[02:24:30]  beats a whole lot of  I think you did  90%  I did it  loses to 10%  maybe  maybe you didn't  do it  that's our system  she went through  the system  and that's what  happened  they couldn't  the prosecution  couldn't even  come up with  a real  mode of  of fucking  murder  they don't even  know how the  kid died  she gets to  fucking shape  the thought  process of  America  okay  and 
[02:25:00]  this  unreasonable  woman  she's a  fucking  unreasonable  woman  yeah  and you know  she gets to  shape  how you think  when she's  telling you  the jury  fucked up  how is she  saying that  yeah yeah  then you have  there's the  hypocrisy of it  go to every  jury that might  have fucked up  in something  but it  concerns you  and your  crusade  but I like to  ask Nancy Grace  would you trade  in your entire  career  to find 
[02:25:30]  every kid  that's ever  been missing  would you do  that  would you get  no because  that wouldn't  help  no no no  it would help  she'd be a liar  and say yes  I would  she'd be like  yes of course  I would  and meanwhile  she wouldn't  here's  Nancy Grace  and O'Reilly  talking about  the Tot Mom  and the naming  of the Tot Mom  you have to admit  that the way  you presented  the material  throughout the trial  was flamboyant  you nicknamed  Casey Anthony  Tot Mom  what does Tot Mom  mean  anyway  what is that  well you know what 
[02:26:00]  to you  I will finally reveal  where Tot Mom  came from  when I was in law school  I would often give  cases that I had to memorize  hundreds and hundreds  sometimes thousands  of pages of legal documents  for class  and it was easier for me  to remember a case  by the content of the case  not the name  Smith vs. O'Shaughnessy  so I would name each case  by the content  in this case  I needed content  that would fit  at the bottom 
[02:26:30]  of the screen  so our viewer  would know  what we were talking about  and Tot Mom fit  but it did sound like  a denigrate  you're lying  you're lying  horse shitting  everyone loves  a good catchphrase  just say it  and it's Pops  Tot Mom  because she could have  had anything written  at the bottom  of her screen  so people knew  associated with  murdering her child  that could be  the top selling t-shirt  since the smiley face  of course  Tot Mom is huge  she's fucking lying  it almost is up there  with Coca-Cola  in terms of how  fucking smooth it sounds 
[02:27:00]  right  Tot Mom  well all these great products  have a nice  you know catchphrase  fucking  but she  I mean  she's in a catchphrase business  yeah  but why are we always  trying to  prove the hypocrisy  of a bitch  like Nancy Grace  we just know  what she is  I don't know  don't people know  I would love to think  that a lot of people know  and you just  you just hang on  Twitter enough  to know there's a lot  of dummies out there  that don't know this shit  don't even care  no they 
[02:27:30]  they see it  how they  see it on TV  without breaking it down  Tot Mom  Tot Mom  well Bill  that's good for ratings  well Bill  why don't you tell  Bill O'Reilly  you know coming up  with a catchphrase  like Tot Mom  is good for my show  and good for ratings  and if I have  if I have really good ratings  I make more money  that's the real answer  when I thought  see when I was in  law school  Bill  here is the background  the prophetic reason 
[02:28:00]  why I said Tot Mom  right  you know I could have  just said Kaylee  yeah  young Kaylee  but I just said  Tot Mom  just goes well  she could have had  Kaylee at the bottom  of her screen  she should have said  it rolled well  I just thought  damn  that's a catchy  phrase  it's not a bad  catchphrase  Tot Mom  Tot Mom's the shit  Nancy on it  be proud of it  came up with a good  catchphrase  if it wasn't  for the fact  that she  is being vilified  to the point  of OJ  somehow  that is a great 
[02:28:30]  t-shirt  yeah  oh they'll  they'll be wearing it  oh you think so  oh yeah  oh yeah  of course they will  I don't think nobody's wearing  fucking  that's like wearing  it's not going to be  like a winning  winning  t-shirt  but  free OJ  you didn't see  a whole bunch  of those shirts  but you saw a few  you saw a few  that stepped out  with that shirt  it was black people  but who's going to wear  what demographic  is wearing  fucking  you know  Tot Mom  middle aged guys  there'll be a few  middle aged guys  maybe so 
[02:29:00]  that will  absolutely have  a Tot Mom shirt  at a  Leonard Skinner  concert somewhere  you know what  you gotta  you'll see a few  Bill  Bill  I just think that  you know  whenever I stand  I think of my  two little children  oh  Wednesday and  Lindsay and  Swinsey  Swinsey and  Twinsy  Mary and  Shmary  I just love  the  oh god  and then people  call in and go  oh the same  voice  oh god 
[02:29:30]  I just love  what you do  and are the  twins sick  this week  yeah they had  a cold  oh god  that fucking  show makes me  fucking sick  well here's the  rest of the clip  on Tot Mom  screen so our  viewer would know  what we were  talking about  and Tot Mom  fit  but it did sound  like a denigration  it's nothing personal  no but it did  sound like a denigration  it does not sound like a denigration  well sure it did  Tot Mom  well I don't think it did  it was like that  okay  would it better to be  cold blooded killer  would that be better  I think  it's Tot Mom 
[02:30:00]  it has a ring to it  how about Casey Anthony  that's what we said  Tot Mom  she can put that  at the bottom of the screen  Tot Mom  and every time  she referenced her  it was Tot Mom  so it's like  she tried to make it  her own with a catchphrase  with a catchphrase  and a bit of a dig  that's fucking  bullshit  which is fine  what I'm saying is  it's fine  but don't bullshit us  she's bullshitting herself  my twin  you think she bullshits herself  she's so gone  and who the fuck  Nancy Grayson came in  show me Nancy's husband  in this bitch

[02:33:00]  I want to feel  that it's like  to be fucked by 12  show number 7  come on  you know  we just gave a porn  fucking  some porn company  they just stole it  you know they stole it  that's great  let's work on it  at least give us a bottle of wine  Nancy Grace  fucking  fucking Gawker  never gave us a bottle of wine  for the wiener thing  that's all I wanted  bastards  so there's your celebrity rehab  and then a guy's yelling at me  he's like  you don't know anything  about addiction  I wasn't even saying  I knew anything about addiction  my whole point  on the celebrity rehab thing 
[02:33:30]  is there's a lot of  a lot of fucking duds  on this list  that Dr. Drew didn't help  that's all I was saying  what the fuck is that about  I don't know anything  about addiction  and trying to get sober  it's an unreasonable statement  my point is that  why would Dr. Drew  continue with a show like this  when it's making him  look kind of bad  he's under the microscope  with this show  okay so  maybe the addiction guy  can explain  why you're wrong  I know who it was  so call the show  you know I mean  what does that even mean  writing a quick instant 
[02:34:00]  feedback sometimes sucks  if you want to  if you want to  challenge us  then call the show  I know which guy you were  so call and I'll see you  on the phone line  so who  I didn't say anything  about addiction  I don't know shit  about that  but maybe he's  maybe there's something  in there where he's saying  Dr. Drew  is doing a good job  and he did do something  and addiction  maybe he's taking  the responsibility  off of Drew  and putting it  completely on those people  Drew did what he was  supposed to do  maybe he's saying that  my argument to that 
[02:34:30]  would be  that first of all  the show is set up  to fail  I know for a fact  that they're only  in this house  for three weeks  is it now Sam  I think so yeah  because Dr. Drew  doesn't have  fucking time  to waste  he has another show  he has all the shit  he wants to do  so he films this show  in three fucking weeks  and I know that much  about trying to get sober  you need a little more time  than 21 days  and I'll tell you what  I want the person  that's trying to save my life  to have a little bit  more passion  than hey man 
[02:35:00]  you know  you're just a  you know  come on man  stop it  stop  alright I gotta go  like I watch  I watch a little bit  of Drew  and he's just  it's just no  and he has to wrap it up  like every other TV show  so they have the  I would love to talk  to this guy  so he has the  graduation ceremony  when maybe he should say  okay this three weeks  is over  it seems like you guys  are on the right path  but you know  you got a long road  ahead of you  instead of handing them  a certificate  like you graduated  like you are  you are cured  but you know 
[02:35:30]  what a certificate is  and a graduation is  you are done  that's just like  that's what I'm saying  if you go to high school  my responsibility is over  you graduate from high school  fucking you know  you know  Mr. fucking Feeney  from your high school  is not responsible  for the fact that  you can't read no more  you did what you could  to get through our system  and then you're out  right  you know you get out of jail  hey  we'll let you out  you know what though  you fuck up again  you go back  but it reflects badly  on the school then  yeah 
[02:36:00]  you're basically saying  look I'm done  it's a system  I'm done  but then that high school  in your case  looks kind of shitty  but every system does  that the health  every system  he has the health  the mental  the mental health system  that's  you see these bums outside  it's a failed system  it's supposed to fail  like you said  all right  so he's  maybe he doesn't mind  he's not trying to kill people  maybe he doesn't mind  that he looks like he's failing  but he's not 
[02:36:30]  because if you look at the system  I said looks like  it's the same exact  you know  you would think that he would  he would put himself  on a higher standard  that's what I'm thinking  but he's not  but you know what  he is  he's putting himself  on a higher standard  because it's celebrities  he's trying to kill all  he's the celebrity doctor  right  you know  right  which seems pretty damn tough  to begin with  my mother  my mother  you know  she didn't hug me  and that's why I'm like I am  thank you Dr. Drew  why didn't she hug you 
[02:37:00]  well I'm just being  well she didn't hug me actually  we weren't lovey-dovey  me and my mother said  we love you now  and it's really  you know  it's amazing  it's kind of a drum roll  it's amazing  it's  we do it  I think she needs it now  growing up she was  you know  women were hardcore  growing up  black women were hardcore  when I was a kid  21 were like  was like 50  21 year old women  were like  like now  I'm 41 
[02:37:30]  I look at a 21 year old  and I'm  you know  borderline  I saw  a young thing in line  at the supermarket  yeah  shaking a little bit  you're breaking down  I said  I said  you know  you know  my girl went to go  grab some crackers  I was in the self-serve line  and it was this  little young thing  she had on a short set  and it was  it was hugging  the booty perfectly  yeah  and I  and here's where  I'm  I'm 
[02:38:00]  I'm folding  in terms of the creepy shit  I  I was thinking  not of  fucking her  normally  I just  was thinking of  the most disgusting  thing  horrid thing you could  like  I wonder if I could  suck her asshole  like I'm being honest  like it was just  it was  it was demonic  in terms of  it was demonic  in terms of  like holy  shit  my knees were shaking  but I didn't even 
[02:38:30]  I didn't have my hair lined up  I was trying to get ready to  fucking cook  you know my beard  my shit wasn't trimmed up  so I'm just standing around  looking like a complete bum  so I had maybe  point  point one  liter of swag  and  and I looked at that girl  like I just  I just wanted to say  how much  yeah right  like take a  take some money  I don't even want to  fuck you  I just want to  I just want to see it  it was tremendous  tremendous  yeah yeah 
[02:39:00]  you know what I'm saying  well  save that thought  because we got our guest in  oh  Ben Mesrick  he's a good friend of the show  this fucking guy  god we've known him for a long time  and now he's doing Oscar  I see him all over  the TV today  Oscar winning films now  yeah  based on his book  Yar  what was the name of the  the name of the last movie  Social Network  of course  what was the name of that last book  Social Network  Ben Mesrick  wrote the book  oh it's on cable now  I love Social Network  I didn't  that's another movie  I'm getting 
[02:39:30]  you gotta work yourself up  yeah I'm trying to get to see  I'm trying to  I'll be honest  I haven't seen it yet  I'm trying to figure out  how I didn't watch it  there's a rhythm  and how do I watch it  I wanted  I think me and you  we're pretty fucking  close together on movies here  but there's  there's a rhythm to that movie  if you're not up  if you're not  up for  Social Network  will lose you quick  you gotta be up to see that movie  it is fast paced  I need to know how to watch it  the main guy there  is talking a mile a minute  to start off the film  and you gotta  I put the subtitles on  because I got one of those 
[02:40:00]  and it reminds  it reminds me  get through that opening scene  it reminds me of  you know  the  the little  ironic  the ironic  Jew kid thing  is starting to really  it's just  the ironic  kid  like  thing  it's starting to bug me  and I see that  as that kind of movie  yeah  you know  just the  hey I'm gonna say things  that could be things  but I don't  if they're not  I don't care 
[02:40:30]  let's go to break  and we can talk about this  with Ben  Ben has another  book out called  Sex on the Moon  and I hear this is gonna be  a movie too  unbelievable  man  un-fucking-believable  cleaning up as they say  absolutely  is he the new  Michael Crichton?  oh Michael Crichton  he's been writing a while  Bringing Down the House  was one of his books  that was made into a movie  as well  who was in that  Queen Latifah?  Queen Latifah was in it  Queen Latifah  and Ice Cube  and  The Cube 
[02:41:00]  if you knew anything  about black people  you could've ran with that  I know  but you said  fucking Ice Cube  fucking Ice Cube  this is why  nobody likes white people  it's just the disrespect  you have for black people  you went right to Ice Cube  I don't know  your favorite rapper actor  I'll be honest with you  some other relevant  I'll be honest with you  I went with the go-to guy  I know  in my head  you could've just  we all have go-to guys  you just said  mine's Ice Cube  that's the Cube  I couldn't even tell you  what Ice Cube has done  really  god damn it 
[02:41:30]  you could've said  if you said Omar Epps  that would've got  some of us  respect points  well I'm gonna write that down  for next time  asshole  alright Ben Mesrick next  stay there  you're listening  to Opie and Anthony  on the virus  Sirius XM  that's a great conversation  we got Ben here  maybe we can work it  into the conversation 
[02:42:00]  Ben Mesrick  how are you sir  I'm good  I'm good  you've done our show  for many years now  a lot of times  for a long time  and when I saw  the Oscars  and you got on that stage  with the social network crew  I was like  god I know that guy  it was nuts  that came out  I mean  the kind of stuff I write  you don't expect  is gonna win an Oscar  it's amazing man  Aaron Sorkin  scripted it  and wrote  an unbelievable thing  and David Fincher  directed it  and it was just amazing  is that the first person  you ever knew 
[02:42:30]  that was on the stage  getting an Oscar  well I was on the stage  for the Globes  Oscar Aaron Sorkin  thanked me  oh yeah yeah  that's right  okay right  damn it  should've went up there  I know  but King's Speech  I mean he's done  our show enough  where I feel like  he's  just run up though  he's kind of a friend  he's a friend of the show  you know what I mean  those type of guys  yeah  so I don't know  but wow  and now you got  Sex on the Moon  Sex on the Moon  know who  Jimmy read the first  hundred pages  to get ready  for this interview  but he had to go out  to LA 
[02:43:00]  to do Leno  but he said  before he left  this book  is really good  oh that's awesome  he loved  the first hundred pages  this is the craziest story  I've been involved with  I mean  this is a kid  who was at NASA  he was basically  on his way  to the astronaut  training program  college kid  brilliant  fell in love  with a girl  who was an intern there  and to impress her  he broke into the lab  this impregnable lab  and stole a 600 pound safe  full of moon rocks  from every moon landing  in history  and they're the most  valuable thing on earth  one gram 
[02:43:30]  was once sold  for five million dollars  and he spreads them  on a bed  and had sex  with his girlfriend  on the moon  and then tries to sell them  to this guy  he meets on the internet  turns into a huge  FBI sting operation  a hundred agents  and guns and everything  and he goes to jail  for seven and a half years  and then calls me  when he gets out  and he's like  I want to tell  because he saw my movies  and my books  in prison  they called him  moon rock in prison  that was his nickname  and no one had ever  heard the story before  I was just going to say  why didn't we hear  this story  because NASA didn't  want anybody to know  it was very embarrassing 
[02:44:00]  for them  and there had been  one article written  about it  I mean he was  one of their own  he was going to be  an astronaut  and he just fell in love  I mean everyone's  done something stupid  out of love  but that was like  really stupid  and Jimmy  I don't know how much  of the book you want  to give away  but Jimmy was telling us  a little bit about  these moon rocks  and how valuable they are  it's crazy  and how they're  in sealed containers  and stuff  and they don't want  the containers opened  yeah because  they've only been gotten  once in history  during the space  Apollo missions  everyone went to the moon 
[02:44:30]  and we got  840 pounds  is all there is  in existence  840 pounds  of moon rocks  is all that's here  and NASA has it all  in these locked labs  and sealed in little bags  they were each brought back  by hand from the moon  you know the fake moon landing  from the fake moon  from the fake moon  that's it  created them in a laboratory  I'll say that to Buzz Aldrin  I'll punch you in the face  he will  Mr. fucking fake Buzz  I've never seen Buzz  in the same room  with fucking  didn't he punch somebody  he did  some like blogger guy 
[02:45:00]  with a camera  came up in his face  and said  yeah why don't you tell us  how the moon landing  was faked  he leaned over  and fucking clocked him  right in the face  that's awesome  it's fantastic  how do you test  the authenticity  of a moron  well first of all  the guys who actually  brought it back  you know  when they sealed it  and it came off  of the space capsule  there actually is a way  to do it  so I'm like  this is from the moon  yeah yeah  so what you do  first of all  there's a way  to look at it  and you can tell  the difference  between a moon rock 
[02:45:30]  that was on the moon  and a moon rock  that like came  on an asteroid  or whatever  because the moon  doesn't have an atmosphere  so it has many craters  all over it  and supposedly  it's not possible  in a lab  to fake that  but I'm not an expert  but the guy  who he tried to sell it to  was a Belgium gem dealer  and who had never been  out of Antwerp  Belgium in his life  and he's the one  who called the FBI  he became the FBI's  expert on moon rocks  what a bastard  he snitched on the moon rock kid  he snitched on the moon rock kid  yeah  what?  who cares 
[02:46:00]  they're just a bunch of rocks  well you know  and the kid  so there was a way  to test them  to see whether  they were real or not  and it's in the book  I don't remember  it's pretty  you know  there's a way  to tell the difference  but I will say  one of the guys  who went to jail  for five years  for this crime  he was like the middle man  he found the guy  on the internet  he when I called him  to interview him  the first thing he said to me  is you don't think  we really made it to the moon  do you?  so literally one of the kids  who tried to sell the rocks  didn't even believe  they were from the moon  so there's a lot of people 
[02:46:30]  who still think that way  I'm gonna be very honest  I was just like  ah Ben Messick  could kiss my ass  with this stupid book  Jesus  he's a fellow Boston guy  I don't like white people  from Boston  I despise these new Boston movies  by the way  where they're fucking  pulling their bootstraps up  Boston's the place  to film these  but I wanted to say  that this five minutes  this is interesting  I love this  this is fucking fascinating  I apologize for where 
[02:47:00]  my mind was  no I like that  they gave me the fucking  the sheet  and I'm just like  I'm winning you over  this is amazing  this is absolutely amazing  Ben knows how to tell a story  this is fucking fantastic  oh thank you  but I will also say  when I wrote  Bringing Down the House  which is still my favorite book  about the MIT blackjack team  but the book  21  21  the book came out  the same week  the Queen Latifah movie  Bringing Down the House  came out  so everybody I knew  kept calling me  and saying  I'm seeing billboards  for your book  what does Queen Latifah  play in your book  and I get out of your saying  I know I wrote the book  about MIT blackjack team 
[02:47:30]  but here's how they knew  that one was Ben's  and the other one was black  the word the  was spelled D-A  that's how you know  if it's D-A  bring it down the house  that's the one for you  that's the black one  can I ask you one  one question  I don't know  if you want to answer this  I'll answer anything  well because it's  it's been a few years now  I've told you many times  I loved Bringing Down the House  the book  I didn't like the movie so much  21  I didn't hate it  well that's not on him though 
[02:48:00]  but I want to ask him  now that's been a few years  yeah  he was  it was his baby  they made into a film  are you happy with the film  how much control do you have though  I have no control over anything  so when people write books  they are  you're just completely  we're like lower than the caterer  yeah  we're the lowest person  they buy the rights  and they tell you to go  whatever  well I was on set  and you're not a Boston cracker  by the way  you're Jewish right  I am Jewish  so this is not a Boston cracker  this is not a Boston cracker thing  I even like him  because he's a Boston Jew  he went through what I went through  did you like what they did with your book  now that it's been a few years  you know what 
[02:48:30]  I actually like 21  because every 21 year old guy  watches that movie  before they go to Vegas  so it captured something about like  kids hitting Vegas  it's not like rounders  it's not like the rounders of blackjack  right  and they didn't set out to make that  and you know rounders didn't do well  and so  they made a movie that was like  which is a great movie  you know what Ben is  Ben is the Michael Crichton  there you go  of the information age  I want to put that on the back  God damn  Patrice O'Neill  Patrice O'Neill  the Michael Crichton  of the information age  probably even 
[02:49:00]  there's something better  but you're  he's the Twitter  not MySpace anymore  Facebook  Facebook  he's that guy  they're gonna make all his movies  he's the young  fucking  everybody  let's make a movie  that's young and relevant  this is the man  you talk to right here  you already have  two movies under your belt  two of your books  two of your books made it  made into movies  any more  well Sex on the Moon  we sold it to the same producers  of the social network  so it's Kevin Spacey  and Scott Rudin 
[02:49:30]  and Dana Burnetti  and DeLuca  and it's being made by Columbia Sony  so this is the next one  Kevin Spacey's a producer  he produced 21  and he produced social network  in this one  he's my first reader  so when I finished the book  I sent it to Kevin  and he's been  you know  a big  and he's feeling that  he loves it  and we've already  they're already working on it  you're making money man  well I mean  yeah he's making money  look at his fucking wife  you're making money man  this piece of shit gets her  I agree with that  I agree with that  are you fucking serious 
[02:50:00]  let's be honest here  this guy is banking  fuck are you crazy  you seen his 10  yeah she's  she's way hotter than me  I can't wait till his fifth book  and he's just hitting her  in the head with it  if you had seen me  in college  Ben  let's do something  you see me writing  when you see me writing  how do you think  you got those shoes  what you're saying  is don't ever  take it for granted  don't ever take it for granted 
[02:50:30]  whatever the fuck  you see me doing  why do you think  you're here  like the shining  when you hear this  stay the fuck away  Wendy  Wendy  if you had seen me  in college  you'd know  I was 114 pounds  as a college senior  at 5'10  I was like  I looked like  Chris Evans  before he becomes  Captain America  yeah yeah yeah  we were just talking  about that yesterday  things have  worked out much better  so did this kid  seem like a nice guy  a very nice 
[02:51:00]  actual nice guy  I wish you well  I wish this guy  well already  I like this  this kid that stole  the moon rocks  did he ruin the moon rocks  did he open them up  from the containers  he had sex on some of them  so they frown upon that  and then  he  you know  nobody really  he actually ate  a little piece also  because he wanted  to be the only person  to have moon rock  in his blood stream  oh my god  is that dangerous  he packed it all back up  and he sent  he put it in a FedEx box  the stuff he wasn't  going to sell  to return to NASA  he was actually  a good kid  he just did something stupid 
[02:51:30]  he tried to sell  for $100,000  a portion of it  he didn't realize  the person he was selling  to had already  turned to the FBI  so he walks into  this restaurant  and he notices  everyone in the restaurant  is between the ages  of 30 and 40  because they were all FBI agents  and he remembers  looking at it  and I have  I got all of the FBI files  I filed with the FBI  and I got a thousand pages  and the first thing he says  to the FBI agent  is like  man I hope you're not  wearing a wire  or I'm fucked  that's the first thing he says  that's a great thing  to have on recording too 
[02:52:00]  it was over right there  when you're talking  with the people  from the books  that you're writing  now do you have to  call your books  fiction  because you have to  or you  you can call it  an actual story  these are true stories  I mean  how do you corroborate  and make sure  that it's absolutely  positively real  and I interview  everyone I can  pretty much  and then I get  all the court documents  and I get the FBI files  and I interview  hundreds of people  and I've got  by the end  I've got like  10,000 pages 
[02:52:30]  of stuff  when you name the book  Sex on the Moon  that was my wife's title  by the way  so I'm not the dirty mind  behind the title  don't give her credit  let her stay delusional  let me tell you  a little story  Sex on the Moon  yeah great  thanks for your little title  let me tell you  a little story  about a guy  that was in a band  that eventually  got him into radio  and he was married  to a girl  that worked at a bar 
[02:53:00]  and before they got married  he went into this bar  and met one of the guys  in the band  that eventually  he got in with  wrote some song parodies  and got on the radio with  the lawyer used that  as if she  if she wasn't working  at the bar  he wouldn't have  hooked up with the band  wouldn't have written  this song  sent it into a guy  let's just call him  Opie  and wound up  getting on the show  that became  the Opie and Anthony show  and then got  right  of half his shit 
[02:53:30]  don't ever admit  that stuff  so what he's saying  never admit  always have  just always  always mistrust her  do you think  do you think  honestly  don't look at her  don't look  don't look at her  because if you get  writer's block  she might be on  a magic carpet  right out of here  do you think  during Howard Stern's  divorce proceedings  that he loved the fact  that in his movie  he went  and it was Allison  it was all about Allison  I give my girl 
[02:54:00]  no credit shit  it's in a movie  I'm telling my girl  right now  you get no credit  bitch  there's some bitterness  I hear some bitterness  when she said that  when she said that  book title  you should have said  that's a great  you know  I already have it  written down  we're thinking  something like that  so give her a little  credit  you should have called it  lunar fucking  just because she  called sex on the moon  let me ask you a question  Ben  so when you call 
[02:54:30]  when you call it  sex on the moon  yeah  it's so  his story  of having sex  on the rocks  is so important  to the name of the book  yeah  that how do you  you just have to  take it for granted  that he's telling you the truth  so what happens  is they're in a hotel  they're about to go  to this restaurant  there's a third character  named Gordon  who's like this druggie  so this  Gordon was like a pothead  who the main character  Thad Roberts  had come to  and said  you might know criminals  can you tell me  how I can sell 
[02:55:00]  these moon rocks  and so Gordon  is the one  who went on the internet  and found some guy  so Gordon  found a great guy  Gordon didn't even realize  that they were real moon rocks  he didn't know  his friend worked at NASA  he didn't even believe  we'd been to the moon  so he shows up  at the hotel room  he walks in  and Thad Roberts says  here's the moon rocks  and he looks in  and he sees all these  NASA emblems  and he's like  oh fuck  and he's like  we could get in a lot of trouble  and that's like  yeah you know  it's all set up  and so Gordon says  I'm gonna go get a pizza  because he's like  totally stoned  so he walks out  of the hotel room  and that's when Thad 
[02:55:30]  does the sex scene  and Gordon comes back  into the hotel  and the girl  they're just finished  with having sex  and then they say  they just had sex  on the moon rocks  so there's a third person  who just walked  into the room  and then at trial  and he said it  he said it again  he talked about it  so you know  in the end  you're right  I wasn't in the room  when he and her  had sex on the moon  but there's multiple people  who say that they did  it's as confirmed  as it can be  without being there  yeah  maybe the Sheraton  has a photo  or something  somewhere  maybe they have  a two-headed maid now 
[02:56:00]  right  so how long  does it take  the research  in conjunction  with the book  this one took a year  because I had to  trust him  and he had to trust me  and he had just  he called me  literally  he had just gotten  out of prison  so he was in probation  and I had never met  anybody who'd been  in prison that long  so I flew  and I met him  in a crowded lobby first  and he was the nicest  most charismatic  like brilliant  who pays him you?  no he can't get  I didn't pay him anything  oh wow  he can't get money  from his crime  this country  thanks 
[02:56:30]  Sam's son of Sam  rule is  but  yeah but did you give him  a little gift  a nice bottle of wine  or something  I mean he's  I know that the movie  people are going to  involve him in some way  you know  maybe he'll be a consultant  or something like that  and then he can get  paid for that  I don't know what  the rules are  I don't think  what if they hire him  to be the caterer  the caterer  or the expert on moon rocks  right  he knows  I'm sure that there  would be  and also he can  you know  if he gets infamous  you know  there's speaking  there's stuff  that you can do  what percentage 
[02:57:00]  of all the world's  moon rocks  did he have  well very tiny  so he stole  there was a safe  and it was marked  it was essentially trash  so it was moon rocks  that had already been  experimented on  that NASA doesn't use anymore  that's shoved in a corner  basically  but he actually stole it  from his professor's lab  so his professor  had been working on it  so the professor claimed  that he ruined  his life's work  and that's the reason  they threw the book at him  I mean they put him in jail  for seven and a half years  hold on  speaking of that  but it was only  100 grams 
[02:57:30]  that he stole  in the 600 pound safe  so out of  840 pounds  it was like  that's nothing  but Ben  what do you learn  from moon rocks  that was this guy's  lifetime work  there was also  a piece of Mars  on there too  in the safe too  so you know  to see what the atmosphere  I don't even know  there's all these  different things  they do  nothing  they're learning nothing  they learn  the origins  of the earth  they're learning nothing  they learn  the chemical  composition  of some celestial bodies 
[02:58:00]  and you know  NASA could have  destroyed the value  by just going  keep them  take them  we're just going  to arrest you  for just stealing them  yeah yeah  but we don't give a shit  we don't give a shit  about moon rocks  moon rocks  who cares  see what we got  in other safes  Uncle Sully  Beacon Hill  ask Ben  if it's true  that he writes books  in an empty apartment  in an empty apartment  I write books  in  I have an apartment  it's not empty  but it's my office  and it's  I shut the drapes  and I have music loud 
[02:58:30]  and like  I sit in like a dark  I'm like a little hermit  when I write  that sounds sexy  that sounds pretty cool  that's like a movie moment  it's very dark  you don't go to Vermont  I don't do the whole  like misery thing  you don't get to hit my car  I did  I wrote  Bring Down the House  I wrote in Vegas  and I went  and I stayed in a different  hotel every night  for three weeks  and wrote that book  because I wanted to feel  like I was  I'm so impressed  by people who write books  it's amazing  does it come easy to you  it's amazing to me  the writing isn't  the research takes a lot  but I go inside it 
[02:59:00]  I mean I really become  a part of the story  like I was sneaking around NASA  and the main character  was texting me  wait how did you sneak around  so what happened is  NASA didn't want to talk to me  they didn't want anybody  writing this  and they told all the scientists  not to talk to me  and so I just went on their website  and they have this level 9 tour  and they take 12 people a day  three days a week  and you get really inside NASA  so I just signed up  and I'm thinking  they're gonna cross check my name  and they're not gonna  but no  and so I fly to Houston  and I'm just doing this tour  and you're literally inside  where all the astronauts are  you're by the space shuttle simulator 
[02:59:30]  and dad texts me  and he's like  okay there's a door  go through that door  and that's where my office was  and that's where I used to sit  at the cafeteria  so I did my own  he was my tour guide  as I'm in NASA  and it's all perfectly fine  I mean they  you know  they had my name  and everything  they just didn't realize  it was the same person  that they had told  all their scientists  not to talk to  it's a big organization  the elite  of the elite  what'd you learn about NASA  that we don't know about  you know when you think of NASA  you think of the 60s  and you're picturing Tom Hanks 
[03:00:00]  in a little silver capsule  but that's not at all  what NASA's like  it's all about Mars  and they have like robots  and stuff  and it's the coolest place  in the world  one of the  they have this  I mean I'm really geeky  but they have this swimming pool  that's the largest swimming pool  in the world  and they sink  a space shuttle  into the swimming pool  and they sink  an international space station  and then the astronauts  in full uniforms  dive  because underwater  is similar to being in space  and they work  as if they're on the space shuttle  underwater  in this massive swimming pool  so I'm in there 
[03:00:30]  and Thad's like  his job was swimming around  with the astronauts  because he was a scuba expert  and so he's like  that's where you know  and that's where  when moon rocks were stolen  he's taking a shower  after the pool  and everyone at NASA's like  did you hear somebody  fucking stole 600 pounds  of moon rocks  and then everyone's like  and Thad's sitting there  oh really  and they didn't notice  it was stolen  for 48 hours  so it was 48 hours  after the theft  everyone at NASA realized  the safe was gone  can I ask you  the like  moving ahead to the movie  part of it  so social network  is the untold story 
[03:01:00]  of the man  who the kid that created  the biggest  boom boom ba ba ba boom  right  so this one  what's the vision of  the  is it the  the story  that you didn't hear  like what would be  the thing  that pops  well the subtitle  is the amazing story  behind the most audacious  heist in history  but I think  you know  I don't  I mean I don't get involved  in the PR  but I think they're gonna  I think this story  is really cool  because it's like  Ocean's Eleven  meets the right stuff  so it's got both  the Ocean's Eleven stuff  but then it's got  all the space things 
[03:01:30]  but it's also a romance  because he was in love  and we've all done  something stupid  what happened to her  well she dumped him  so he gets to prison  and she and her friend  were part of the crime  so the three of them  did the crime  him and a 19 year old  and a 20 year old girl  and he goes to the courts  and says  I did it all  I forced them to do it  oh no  he takes the rap  because he's still in love  with her  and he's  the bitch from Juno  he took the pinch  he took it  took the pinch like a man  he writes a letter to her  every day  right from jail  he writes a letter 
[03:02:00]  every single day  and in his third year  he comes back to his  you know little room  as his cell  I guess it's called  right  and stacked on his bed  are all of the  unopened letters  because her father  wouldn't let her read them  and I contacted her  and she was not happy  I was writing this book  really  she was like  you know  a stupid moment  she should have got involved  because I know  in his story  she is a  no you know what  she is an ass  he still  he doesn't say that  he always is like  he loved her 
[03:02:30]  he's hoping to get back together  he did it for her  he's hoping  what is that guy doing now  is she hot  well  you know  his  I mean  sure  he described her  as very beautiful  and super hot  oh you didn't see her  I haven't seen her  she didn't want to talk to me  I bet she is  does she have a Facebook page  let's take a look at this  I searched for her a lot  I changed her name  in the book too  because she asked me to  she asked me to  but on CBS Sunday morning  the other day  they did show a picture of her  so I don't know  but his  ex-wife was beautiful too  so he got kicked out of his home 
[03:03:00]  he had a hard background  he was a fundamentalist Mormon  household  and at 17  he confessed to his parents  he had premarital sex  so they banished him to the basement  banished  he was not allowed to speak  to anyone in the family  because he was going to hell  and then he was kicked out of the house  and they never spoke to him again  so when he went to jail  it was a no cash bail  anybody could sign him out  for it  and he spent a year  in county lockup in Florida  in the place called the submarine  which is the hardcore prison  because no one  because no one would sign a piece of paper  his unreasonable parents 
[03:03:30]  his parents would not speak to him again  and he was done  I hate on me  because of religion  so he had been married at 17  to the girl  18  the girl he had been having premarital sex with  she's beautiful  and then he met this intern  and that was the next thing  but now that he's out of jail  where is he  and what is he doing  oh yeah  and so there's a scene also  he calls his ex-wife  because he has nobody's phone number  he's in jail  and he calls her up  and she hears all of the craziness  behind him in jail  and she's like  well have fun with your new friends  oh  you don't want to hear that  it's hard  no no  fun here is not good 
[03:04:00]  how old is he  he's now  he was 25 when he went to jail  he's 32 now  33  and he's a good kid  he's re-getting his PhD  you know  he studied astronomy  and physics in jail  and got out  and I mean he had a hard  he didn't do  imprisonment was hard  what was his motivation  for stealing this  it was two things  it was love for this girl  he wanted to impress her  but he also was  yeah but isn't it  you can impress a girl  in other ways  and steal a moron  you can impress her  by saying you're going to be an astronaut  that's pretty impressive 
[03:04:30]  you're being rational  I'm being rational  it's like you want to impress her  the most you can  that kind of young love  you want to  but then why try to sell it then  well exactly  there was a financial thing too  it was a mix of  yes that's why he said  he said I'm going to take her to Africa  and she's a bum  but look look  the girl thing  that's all well and fine  but there's got to be an element  of just sheer greed  that comes into this  where he has this  realizes the value  and goes  yeah I can make some money on this  but okay  you know if he hadn't tried to sell it  he probably even got away with it  might have gotten away with it 
[03:05:00]  right  say you stole diamonds  just so you can fuck your girl  on a bed of diamonds  right  then you go  doodly doop do do  like  well I have diamonds  yeah yeah  am I going to return them  to the guy I stole them from  but sell them  I'm confused  how did he get the safe out  I mean they have to have huge security  huge security  first of all to get into the lab  it had an electronic cipher lock  with all the buttons  and he used fluorescing powder  so you could see what buttons  had been pressed  and he used a black light  to do that  so he knew what buttons to press  he gets into the safe 
[03:05:30]  but greasy  he brought a mechanized dolly  wait wait wait  I've heard that before  but how do you know the sequence  well he says  and I asked him about that too  and he says  you can tell with the light  by how bright the light is  on each key  because when you press it  a little bit comes off  of your finger  each time you press  a little bit of the oils  on your finger  comes off on each key  so it's a slight difference  that's what he said  I don't know the answer  to that question  wait wait  I don't get that ant  yeah it would be  the one that fluoresces the most 
[03:06:00]  would be the first key  because that's when you have  the most oil on it  and it slowly dissipates  like paint on a roller  you think that's true  I don't know  that's what he said  I should recreate that  it fucking looks cool  as shit though I bet  that's something  that would look really cool  I didn't redo that experiment  so that's a good question  but then he had two girls  with him  they had a mechanized dolly  that he had gotten  from Home Depot  but what's crazy is  you know  there's cameras everywhere  so he had a  he borrowed a van  that had a NASA emblem on it  he switched the plates 
[03:06:30]  in a parking lot  so it was a random thing  he came on a rainy night  so that the guards  in the kiosks  wouldn't go outside  and he had a NASA ID  he found a back door  he knew how to get  into the back door  and so once he had the safe  they get it on  and him and two  19, 20 year old girls  get this massive safe  but the security cameras  now you're walking around  NASA with a safe  he knows where all  the cameras are  so he essentially  gets around the cameras  there's ways to get around it  like a video game  then when you're in the jeep  you have to drive  at 5 miles per hour  because the speed limit  is 5 miles per hour  through NASA  otherwise they arrest you 
[03:07:00]  it's gotta be nerve wracking  so his getaway  was 5 mile an hour  holy shit  like fucking Austin Powers  I'm gonna kill you  with this safe  full of moon rocks  that sounds like  a video game  where the guards are like  hey what's that  must be the wind  just go about their business  bad video game guards  it's raining  I won't go outside  he pulls up  to the last security kiosk  and the guards  are two feet away  but it's pouring rain  and they don't want  to get outside  and they see a NASA van  see a NASA van  that looks a little heavy  in the back  yeah a little heavy 
[03:07:30]  a couple college kids  in the front  wow  it's crazy  that's an amazing story  that is  crazy story  I don't read  so when are you  doing the audio  do you do the audio  Casey Affleck  did the audio book  wow  then I won't do it  oh you're keeping it  you're keeping it in Boston  keeping it in Boston  yeah  that's what  I never got  the fucking  Boston very clicky  yeah  they got a couple  of Boston  you could have  done the audio  maybe my next book  you'll do the audio  who's the guys  that do the silly movies  the brother  the Farrelly brothers  those sons of bitches  they use all their  old friends  yeah they do  I can't have sperm 
[03:08:00]  in my hair  you fucking  two cocksuckers  where's the black people  in your fucking books bin  racist bin  oh man  I got a story  do you have a story  how comfy  could it be  having sex  on moon rocks  he said it wasn't  that's gotta be  really nasty  he said it wasn't  well you just  place the rocks  he was under the  mattress  carefully  yeah  put a comforter  over him  maybe around you  like  oh man  an older man  can figure out 
[03:08:30]  some stuff to do  with a moon rock  some degrading things  yeah yeah  horrible  stick it in there  go see if you can  float bitch  see if it's anti-gravity  stick this in there  how you feel  anything else about  NASA  NASA  and your time  in there  yeah you know  it was interesting  so the main character  this Gibson guy  who's the professor  he stole from  he claims  and the reason  that Thad got  so much jail time  is that also  in the safe  Gibson says  were these notebooks  these green notebooks 
[03:09:00]  that had his entire  life's work  that he was going  to turn into a book  and when the safe  was found by the FBI  there were no notebooks  so he claims  that Thad destroyed them  Thad says  there never were  any notebooks  and he never saw  any notebooks  the judge  basically threw  the book at Thad  saying  you destroyed  this man's life's work  and he was only  going to get  two years in jail  three years in jail  the maximum was the maximum  it was beyond the maximum  the maximum for what he had done  was really three years  but then they claimed  that he had interrupted  a government operation  which is what  the terrorists get  so they basically got him 
[03:09:30]  as a terrorist  they can just nally on anything  they can make anything up  and he had to do  every single day  he did  well he did seven and a half  instead of eight  holy shit  and it was  you know  he said the worst was  the first year was horrible  because he was in a county lock up  in you know Florida  with murderers  and rapists  and everything  in a real  in a jail  jail is way worse  than prison sometimes  did he get raped  no not that I know of  I was careful  with those kind of questions  but he did say  there was a dead person  in one cell with him  and he learned 
[03:10:00]  for 24 hours  but  and he learned how to  not get killed  he said  he said it was like  that's something  you have to learn  but he did say  you don't want to be there  when he first got to jail  he couldn't understand anybody  because he was  a white kid from Utah  and everyone was  a black guy from Florida  and he couldn't  what's the fed joint  that he went to  it was called  the submarine  orient county  in Tampa  I guess it is  so  so he did most of his time  well he did the first year  in Tampa  and then he was moved 
[03:10:30]  to Colorado  to a federal prison  to a fed  which he said was great  the fed prisons  yeah fed time  is beautiful  he said it was great  you have to do all fed time  like all of it  almost 90%  when you get fed time  but federal prisons  is not as much  bullshit  but the first year  was not fed time  it was horrible  yeah because he was  he was in jail  he was in jail  he was in jail  and so he said  that was hard  and the first night  did he fight  he fought  I'm sure  he goes to sleep  the first night  and all of a sudden  he's woken up  by all the mics  are all saying 
[03:11:00]  Houston we have a problem  Houston we have a problem  because they figured out  that he was the guy  who had robbed NASA  that is hilarious  so he's woken up  by all the guards  torturing him  you just kind of  want to be anonymous  right you do  and so everyone's like  moon rock  and he became moon rock  now I don't believe you  no one's sleeping  their first night  in prison  he said  well I don't know  how many hours  he slept  he did say  he went to sleep  crying  he was crying  he just passed out  finally  who the fuck  is having a good night's sleep  first night  I don't know  if it was a good night  but he's  come fuck with me 
[03:11:30]  I'm the moon rock  motherfucker  bitches  you really are you really  it's a crazy story  but you know  in prison  he set up an astronomy class  and he taught astronomy  for the last two years  and that's how he got back  into the University of Utah  when he got out  astronomy's very interesting shit too  you know what  you sold me man  white guy from Boston  sold me  I like this guy  the comics are really good  they really are  they move  moving forward  have they started casting  the movie or anything  they haven't  but I read somewhere 
[03:12:00]  that they got a director  Will Gluck  the guy who has the new  Mila Kunis  Justin Timberlake movie  coming out  but I read that on the internet  so I don't know anything  more than the internet says  but  you have no choice  on that either  I don't  I mean  you have any choice  on casting  can I play one of the guards  that was in the rain  and let him  yeah you're like  let him go  go ahead  go ahead  no biggie  we had the guy  that played the twins  in social network  oh yeah  Army  Army thank you  he's awesome  what a great guy man  holy shit  that guy's awesome  Army  I'm gonna watch 
[03:12:30]  social network  you love it  it's such a good movie  I just can't  Justin Timberlake's great in it  and I was blown away  I didn't know  he was playing both guys  so there's a model  who they superimposed  you know  his head on the other guy  so nobody knows  who the other guy is  which is kind of sad  but Army's face  is on two different bodies  I just thought they  it's like seamless  it was the fat lady  from everybody dance  now  I thought they just got twins  for the part  yeah  I haven't seen his fucking movie  have you met the real twins yet  have you had those guys  I've seen them in the press 
[03:13:00]  the Winklevai  they're hysterical  yeah are they  they'll never give up  they believe Mark Zuckerberg  is evil man  who stole their idea  and they will continue  what do you think  after going through all that  well you know  I think Mark  is the genius behind Facebook  I do think  that he doesn't treat people well  and I think he led them on  because they were the cool kids  on campus  and they had a website  and they're like  hey come work for us  and he was like  work with the cool kids  cool  and then he just blew them off  and launched Facebook  is that because he  it's been hinted  that he's a bit autistic  I mean  he's a strange kid 
[03:13:30]  he's very socially awkward  he sweats  and they've been doing  tons of media training on him  and he's still like  oh he's a weird kid  he's a weird kid  but he's also brilliant  but he treats people  difficult  and a lot of people  along the way  have sort of run away from him  but he didn't want  you know  he didn't talk to me  he spent a year  refusing to talk to me  and then when the book came out  he called me the Jackie Collins  of Silicon Valley  so I don't  you know  he doesn't like me  all that much  but the movie ended up  also you got all the information  based on not him  well I got  the other main character  Eduardo  who was his best friend  who co-founded the company 
[03:14:00]  is the one who came to me  he got 5% of Facebook  wow that's fucked up  yeah  is that good  that's 5 billion dollars  that's what  5 billion dollars  5 mil a bill  5% of Facebook  is 5 billion  shouldn't he send me  a gift basket  it worked out for him  how does that even  what's the math on that  that means  it's a 100 billion dollar company  holy shit  isn't that crazy  how much does Zuckerberg work  about 15 billion  I think or 8 billion  8 to 15  somewhere I don't know  the number now  he sold it 
[03:14:30]  no they haven't sold it yet  so he still runs it  but that's the valuation  amazing  it's crazy  talk about billions  amazing for an idea  I was reading the other day  there was a kid  who was at Stanford  who just sold ads  for their weekly paper  who Facebook hired  in 2004  who's now worth  70 million dollars  fuck  I mean he was  a college student  in 2004  writing ads  for his paper  you said you're  a techie right  I have a question  not a Trekkie  a techie  no I mean  I'm a geek  I would say 
[03:15:00]  a geeky  okay you might notice  what is  Facebook and Twitter  what do they do  okay so we  we agree on the  demise of MySpace  yeah well  I don't know  Justin Timberlake  Timberlake bought it  for a couple of dollars  but he's got  probably some  powerful people  behind him  to reinvent it  alright well fuck  it's gone  as we  fair enough  all intents and purposes  fair enough  what is  going on with Facebook  and what  what's the root of Facebook  and the root of Twitter  that could see  those two  go the direction 
[03:15:30]  of MySpace  where  oh yeah  I don't think  Facebook's gonna go that way  because I think  Facebook's just getting  they're using Skype now  I think they're doing  a lot of smart things  I can see that  I can see Facebook  staying alive  Twitter I don't understand  how they're gonna make money  I think Twitter's great  and I use Twitter  and I love Twitter  it's a great way  to reach out  and reach a lot of people  and it's incredibly narcissistic  it's all about  no one reads  other people's tweets  they just tweet  right  so  it's so true  I mean you could have  you know a lot of  you tweet to them  and then you just wait  for their responses  right  but you're not really reading  but that's Twitter 
[03:16:00]  right  it's all about  shut up you're gonna ruin it  look at me  look at me  which is very American  everyone wants everyone  to look at you  right  it's true though  so I love  I think Twitter's really usable  I use it like five times a day  tweet tweet tweet  but how do they make money  because if they really  throw ads all over the place  people are gonna  you'll be like  I'm not gonna tweet anymore  but Facebook is something  you use every day  because you want to see  the parties you weren't  invited to right  you see all the pictures  or you want to like  you know  the picture tagging  is the genius behind Facebook  yeah  because that's the first thing  you look at is where  photos  you look at photos 
[03:16:30]  here's what it is  and I'm not on Facebook  that's the strange thing  about that  I don't understand  the workings of Facebook  but  didn't MySpace have pictures  yeah but MySpace  you'd go to someone's site  and there's like  glitter  you know  it was like  it was crazy  you couldn't even like  you can't surf  from site to site  everyone could redo  their own page  so like you'd go to some site  suddenly there's like  music blaring  and the site is shaking  and then your computer  freezes up  I don't know  that was my experience  so Facebook  is just the same  it's the same  everyone's page is the same 
[03:17:00]  and it's like  if a photo comes up  in your news feed  it's like you were tagged  in a photo  and then you go there  and you're like  oh I was there  or whatever  people over customized  the noise  and the music  and videos  three videos  four would start playing  at the same time  it's crazy  so you think MySpace  will Facebook it  and make it like that  no I think  I think they'll try  I think MySpace  it's become a music site  a dedicated music site  you think  yeah  well Timberlake  I mean what  it's gonna be about bands  I would think  yeah  makes sense  Facebook will keep  getting bigger  and Twitter will too 
[03:17:30]  but Facebook's a monster  Ben Mesrick  is the  you are now  you are the focal point  of social  the social world  oh I don't know  you are fucking  Twitter Ben  that's your new shit  I moved on to  Ben tweets  that's your fucking  Ben tweets  that's your shit man  you're the guy  you're the guy  not on purpose  but by that guy  are we gonna come  hang out with you in Boston  nah man fuck you  Patrice is a realist though  he knows  he knows when 
[03:18:00]  these mics go off  it's a whole different world  Ben we are not  hanging the fuck out  unless we're both famous  and I'll hey Ben  and we do one of these  and I'm hanging with Ben  no doubt  did we do it  anything else about  Sex on the Moon  no it's out  the new book by  Ben Mesrick  Sex on the Moon  the great book  by Ben Mesrick  that he named himself  that I came up with  and had no help  from his lovely wife  I'm gonna check it out  I'm speaking at  Bryant Park  at 1230  I'm getting  in the Bryant Park  reading room 
[03:18:30]  I think it's an outdoor thing  and then  tonight at 7  at the Strand  downtown  oh for real  some signings  yes  that's great  Ben Mesrick  on Twitter  spelled M-E-Z-R-I-C-H  thanks  and I love your tweets  and the whole  Anthony Weiner thing  was the greatest moment  how amazing was that  when I opened up  my OP tweet  I read yours every day  and I'm like  seriously  it was me and Ant  and I was like  you got a picture  you got the picture  well  how did you get  do you blame us  no I would have  done that too  the guy  we kind of feel bad 
[03:19:00]  because we just  Anthony especially  made a nice friendship  I was out drinking  with him like  the Monday before  but he was waving  that  no  the guy who had  Wiener's picture  oh  Breitbart  and he was waving  that phone  but that was like  a moment in history  right there  you can't not put that  he was waving it around  I didn't hear nothing  about y'all getting  credit for that shit  that was incredible stuff  we got international  attention  we just don't brag about it  you just don't what  we don't brag about it  we did a day on it  and then we just moved on  that was the biggest thing  you didn't hear about it right  I fucking didn't 
[03:19:30]  why are you laughing at me  when I say that  Sam laughed  I didn't laugh  I'm looking at you  like I didn't know  you broke the story  we were psyched  that we got some attention  of course  it was amazing  the guy was waving  the picture around  and now he's passing  around the room  you're not the reason  you're not the reason  he got bopped  you're the reason  he got fired  you're the reason  he left  Pelosi was  Pelosi was like  look it wasn't  looking good for the guy  we'll get through this 
[03:20:00]  and everything  and then it changed  and the news got out  that right after  the full nude  came out  Pelosi went  he's gotta go  he's gotta go  here's what happened  let me show you  with my phone  exactly how this  happened  I grabbed the phone  from him  he was sitting  he was passing  around the room  he was passing  around the room  now private pile  from Full Metal Jacket  Vincent D'Onofrio  was sitting right there  so he was involved  in this whole thing  we blame him 
[03:20:30]  for this whole thing  you fucking  make this right man  make this story  fucking right  this was some  covert shit  so  and the listeners  were involved  make sure you  explain how you  cock blocked me  the first time  too by the way  well cause that  was too obvious  alright go ahead  the first time  we'll tell the story  so we pass the phone  around and it  gets to Opie  Opie takes the phone  I already had  my phone out  I'm like I'm  taking this  fucking picture  puts it on his  board and goes  like this  now Breitbart's  looking over 
[03:21:00]  and I know  he's gonna  fucking lose  his mind  so I grabbed  the phone  real quick  so I got a  blurry  my first picture  was blurred  does Breitbart  fucking hate you  guys now  yeah  nah  on the outside  I don't know  what really  we'll see what  happens  my opinion  we don't know  for sure  he's probably  only mad  cause he didn't  break it  well he couldn't  he backed himself  into a corner  where he was like  he said he wouldn't  do it because of  the family  and this  and he's not  gonna do this  sensational bullshit 
[03:21:30]  just for the  hell of it  and who got him  the picture  some chick  but Monday  when we went out  drinking  he was showing  everyone  firemen  cops  we were hanging  out at some  bar  he's showing  everyone  in the bar  it was out there  even Barr Walters  after the fact  said I even  saw the picture  I got pictures  of Ann Coulter  looking at the  picture  and she's got  like her hand  over her face  and she's freaking  out and shit  it's funny as fuck  so here's where  where this comes  into play  and the  the audience  pal talk  comes into play 
[03:22:00]  so I grab  the phone  and I go  like this  I go  I go  Opie  I'm not gonna  I don't want  you to have  this because  you're gonna  take a picture  of it  I go like  this  I go  but take  a look  take a look  and he leans  over  and I'm  putting it  right into  the camera  here  and they  screencapped  the shit  out of it  someone then  tweeted it  sent it back  to us  and sent it  back to us  so I tweeted  it we both  tweeted it  and it was  everywhere  that's genius  from a screen  cap  so the listeners  took the picture  all Breitbart 
[03:22:30]  saw was me  holding the camera  up  and showing  Opie  but it's  showing the  camera  this is your  next book  this is Sex  on the Moon  part 2  Ben this is  your next book  that is really  come on  let's do this  and then I had  sex in bed  with Anthony  Wiener  just laying  on top of him  yeah we can  sex it up  we can sex it  up for you  if you need to  Breitbart didn't  realize until he  probably got home  and then he  called you  and yelled at you  I knew about  an hour later  he called me up  and was like  could you put out  a statement  that said that  I had nothing  to do with  the release of this  and shit  and I was like 
[03:23:00]  I knew this  so I wrote  this statement  I just wrote  a statement  and it was like  look he didn't  know this was  going down  and then his  lawyer gets back  to me with  like corrections  on my statement  and other things  I should say  words like  indemnification  and shit  and I'm like  I ain't fucking  sending this back  so I called my  agent and he said  no fuck him  and so that's  where it ended  wow  and uh  how do y'all  feel about this  I feel like  I feel like  I feel a little 
[03:23:30]  dirty  I feel a little  dirty  I feel a little  dirty  but what was  your intention  to be  a journalist  no  our intention  was to be  two radio guys  that hadn't gotten  a good story  in a while  so we're like  hey you get  this dick pic  and all people  were talking about  is we gotta  see this dick pic  everyone wanted  to see it  hold on  hold on  so if you feel  dirty  you didn't get  dirty enough  because you guys  should have  fucking  rode that 
[03:24:00]  to the end  I justified  like this  that picture  was gonna get  out sooner  than later  and we took  our shots  and said  fuck it  it's not like  this thing  is not gonna  be out there  so if you  was gonna  ride that horse  why didn't  you ride it  why didn't  you really  ride it  instead of  like  it kind of  but I mean  in terms of  we broke it  we turned down  interviews and stuff  we broke it  Red Eye  was it  I was on  Red Eye  I talked about  it on Hannity 
[03:24:30]  so yeah  everybody wanted  to talk to us  I just said  no  you should have  said fucking  yes if you're  gonna do that  I made a video  and said look  here  I felt  kind of bad  because guys  he was just  saying to  like some of  the producers  of Red Eye  when I wasn't  even there  so he had  no reason  to say this  shit  he's like  you know man  that Anthony  guy  we just hung  out  like  he goes  really cold  fucking  just  he's such  a dude's  dude  yeah  just like  fucking  drinking  but really  he's  fucking  a TMZ 
[03:25:00]  Jew  and then it was  like I just  fucking  and then I  just fucking  like  you know what  I blame the  pal talk  community  fuck me man  it's a great  story because  he would have  done the exact  same thing to us  and he did  and technically  and I'm not  trying to justify  I'm just saying  these are all the  facts  not even technically  he's site  Breitbart  fucking  his news site  got us suspended  when we were at  fucking  remember Homeless Charlie  Homeless Charlie 
[03:25:30]  he's the guy  that reported  about the homeless  guy that was  on our show  talking about  having sex  with the queen  and shit  no he blew it  off like  hey I wasn't  in charge  and there's  somebody else  it went through  it didn't go  through me  but his name  was on it  and this has  nothing to do  with Breitbart  because everybody  got their agenda  I'm just talking  about  if you was  like Anthony  Weiner  I know it  got out  but it's like  if you're gonna  be the guys  that broke it  you should've  fucking  it made enough 
[03:26:00]  news  it was out there  and once that  happened  Pelosi did an  about face  and just said  you gotta go  we were on  every news channel  we had a news cycle  for about a week  on every one  of these fucking  shows  get him out of there  old footage of us  the dumb video  I made in my  bedroom  telling my side  of the story  another democrat  is gonna get in  there anyway  I pulled out  a macbook  and I made  a quick video  and half hour  later CNN  had it on TV  because I tweeted  it  that's the beauty 
[03:26:30]  of what we're  talking about  with the Facebook  and the social media  the most fucked up  thing during  the whole thing  was when the news  would show  the studio  and Breitbart  but they were  showing fucking  Vincent D'Onofrio  and Breitbart  talking  and saying  yeah this was  released  and if you were  just watching this  you'd think  why is Private Pyle  showing Anthony  Weiner's dick pic  from fucking  like it didn't  make sense  he got involved  with our story  yeah  so is he 
[03:27:00]  on Breitbart's  side or  what side is he  on?  he's a real  liberal  like real  crazy liberal  and that's Breitbart  there  yeah  that's Breitbart  that's Pyle  right there  and fucking  Colbert  did the funniest  fucking thing  took some of this  video  and said  Breitbart's  excuse was  he didn't know  that there was  a camera in the room  he goes  and you could see  from this footage  there isn't a camera  near him  he goes  look  even on the  close ups  you could see  no cameras 
[03:27:30]  were even near him  at the time  that's awesome  hysterical  and Breitbart  somehow  had some kind  of morality  with the  picture  like it was  a doody  dude thing  but he was  never going to  put it on his  side  that's what  he's trying to say  somehow going to  get out  I don't think  he wanted us  to release it  I don't think  he wanted the  timing to be  what it was  he wanted it  on his terms  and we blew  it up for him  we were the ones  that blew it up  but like I said  from what I saw  he was showing 
[03:28:00]  everybody this picture  and I think he was  begging for someone  to take it  and move it forward  because he  couldn't do it  he had already  backed himself  into a corner  but I think  he also wasn't  sure  he was like  I really want  this out there  but I don't know  how to do it  I really believe  that  Vincent D'Onofrio  is right in the  middle of the story  Breitbart will come  back on the show  and we'll have a  discussion about this  eventually  it'll take a little  while but he'll  come back  they talked to him  on Red Eye  and then I talked  on Red Eye  not together  they tried to get us  on the same show  together 
[03:28:30]  that didn't pan out  we were in the  building at the  same time  he was doing  another show  and I was doing  Hannity  and I was  looking around  the halls  like  it's gonna be  awkward  actually  you know  what happened  is  even though  you know  you can  you can speculate  that he was  gonna do  what he was  gonna do  with it  but the fact  is  it's like  I show you  a picture  of like  yo this is  my girl  naked  and everybody's  like whoa  and if somebody  boom  your naked  girl is there  but that's how  it happens 
[03:29:00]  you gotta understand  I am looking  at you like  god  but that's how  it happened  and it wasn't  his picture  some chick  gave it to him  some chick  gave it to him  so then he  feels like  it's his picture  it's not his  picture  he's doing  a  look at what  I got  you gotta be  a little more  subtle  it's like  you don't  walk into the  club and show  De Niro  the new  Cadillac  sitting out  in there  it's a matter  with you  now it's our  picture  you happen 
[03:29:30]  to have just  been a victim  of  a victim  and a beneficiary  of what  somebody else  was gonna do  any god damn  way  and when I  was handed  that  and there's  a camera  right in  front of me  and I know  these devious  fucks that are  watching this  are gonna  screen cap it  it was too  tempting  I was the  child in the  candy store  I was just  like  you know  I think it was  a brilliant  video  give it a try  you know  information wants  to come out  right  information wants  to come out  Anthony's a 
[03:30:00]  piece of  shit  alright  you scooped  Opie  well no  because then we  were fighting to  see who  our thumbs  were aching  to see who  was gonna  tweet it  first  no because  then the  other part  of the story  is then  he shows  me on his  phone  the picture  that was  screen capped  that was sent  to him  and then I  said well  now fuck  you  and I took  a picture  of his phone  and I was  the one  that made  it out  there  so I  ended up  scooping  him  of the picture  of the picture  of the picture  I like  Opie's scoop  of you 
[03:30:30]  we were going  back and forth  scooping each other  let me explain  really fast  so the girl  owned the picture  gave it to  Breitbart  Breitbart felt  he owned the  picture  then Anthony  shows  Powell talked  and whoever  took the picture  of that  owned the picture  sent it to  Anthony  now Anthony  owns the picture  and then I  take the picture  of his phone  and now I  own the picture  it's like  deep inception  it was  level after level  are you writing  this down for your book  that was the whole  thing  that was it  right  that was the  whole thing 
[03:31:00]  though  but that brought  down  that's the one  that went  everywhere  that brought  down a  politician  that's when  I scooped  Anthony  and then did you  read the websites  that were saying  that he couldn't  have taken that  picture himself  because of the  angle  so there must  have been a  third person  in the room  a second person  in the room  a second person  in the room  they're setting up  strings like  ballistics  you guys  are third  degree  of separation  from the  bitch that got  to tweet  the picture  to the fucking  world  that is fucking  mad  that's what I'm  saying  I'm very impressed  I'm very fucking  impressed 
[03:31:30]  that's almost  like Watergate  we haven't had  press in a few  years  we said fuck it  we're taking  our shot  that's awesome  my uncle  who's like  staunch Republican  and stuff  he was very  very happy  about it  he's like  good if we  can't elect  him out  erect him  out  erection  he's old  come on  give him a  break  well that's  fucking  boy I wish  I wasn't so  lazy  you guys  do some  good shit  when you're  not here  it's all  kinds of 
[03:32:00]  shit  sons of  bitches  I'm impressed  I'm very  impressed  it's good  to know you  guys  did you get a  pat on the  back from the  fucking people  in charge  they didn't  even say a  word to us  no  not one  word  we were just  happy they  weren't gonna  drag us in  and bitch us  out for  something  for getting  attention  what are you  doing getting  your show  attention in the  news  stop it  they just  looked you up  and down  we gave  the company  a shitload  of press  you can't  pay for  and they  didn't even  acknowledge it  happened  it's so weird 
[03:32:30]  around here  we're on every  news channel  for three  four straight  days  one of those  guys came  in  not even  on a human  level  nothing  not even  on a human  not even  on the ball  kid with the  glasses  nothing  well that  inspired our  flow chart  if you look  at our  flow chart  up there  could you  read that  Sam  the top  one  it's the  simplest  flow chart  ever  it's a  diamond shape  there's one  box on top  two in the  middle  and one  at the  bottom  it's so 
[03:33:00]  easy  oh he  needs a  mic  why  can't you  just yell  it  it says  did you  do good  did you  do good  now it  goes down  to either  yes or  no  right  and then  regardless  yes or no  it goes back  to one  which reads  there's a  problem  there's a  problem  that is how 
[03:33:30]  everything here  works  not even  on a  human level  did they  say  wow you  guys got  that pic  this is the  strangest place  I've ever  you brought  down  you brought  down a  fucking  politician  with his  fucking  dick  Nancy Pelosi  who was  fucking  speaker of the  house  knows about us  now  you know  she was like  oh these  two idiots  fucking posted  his dick  he's gotta  go  then when  are we  gonna write  the book  the next  book  the  wiener  scandal
