<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion sparked by Anthony's birthday and a news story about a politician giving a speech at a gas station. This led to a meandering conversation about gas prices (including a station charging $497/gallon), podiums (their types, prices, and potential purchase for the show), and a caller who rents them out to politicians.  The conversation veered into a caller's dream about co-hosting with Opie, gas pump limits, Mexican cartels, and online dating.  This was followed by a lengthy segment analyzing Donald Trump's public persona, comparing him to a shock jock, and dissecting his hairstyle with humorous diagrams. They briefly touched upon the upcoming Royal Wedding and a potential (potentially offensive) Times Square stunt, before previewing upcoming segments featuring listener-submitted sounds and an update on Flavor Flav's chicken restaurant.  Jim Norton was in studio with Opie and Anthony, and E-Rock was credited with a surprise birthday song.

The next segment heavily featured a recollection of Flavor Flavâ€™s chaotic takeover of their show, describing it as a terrifying "hostage" situation involving a large entourage and complaints from a station manager.  They discussed potentially creating a "Mystery Science Theater" style special using archived footage.  This transitioned into an update on Flavor Flav's failed chicken restaurant (lasting only four months due to a business partner dispute), including humorous descriptions of its branding.  The hosts then launched into a discussion about fast-food brawls, particularly those involving transgender individuals,  leading to a detailed (and sometimes offensive) explanation of various gender identities with input from a caller, Lydia.  The segment included a humorous, absurdly long list of criteria for what constitutes a "real" restaurant, using McDonald's as a counter-example, and reminiscences about McDonald's' marketing and their childhood experiences with the chain.

The show continued with a lewd joke about Lydia, a studio guest, followed by a disturbing call from Irving who recounted allegedly molesting Lydia as a child. The hosts and Lydia engaged in a darkly humorous exchange with Irving before he hung up. This segued into a discussion of Netflix's stock performance and promotions for fictional audio productions featuring Jim Norton and Rich Voss (an incompetent FBI agent) and Jim Norton narrating a mocking piece about fishing.  Next, they discussed the Chaz Bono documentary, transitioning into highly critical (and offensive) comments about their former SiriusXM bosses, focusing on their improved appearances after leaving the show.  The segment concluded with a critical and offensive analysis of Lady Gaga, playing audio clips of her and mocking her public persona and statements, comparing her to a cult leader.

The following segment began with a humorous, exaggerated prayer for Lady Gaga's success, followed by cynical commentary about her image, referencing violent events and questioning her sincerity.  They provided a phone number for listener opinions on Gaga. This shifted to Anthony's anxieties about his Netflix stock, prompting more mock prayers and a search for a "miracle song."  They discussed other celebrities, including Courtney Love and Burt Reynolds, drawing comparisons to Gaga's manufactured persona. A Kim Kardashian interview clip was played before the show focused on a "most annoying 30 seconds" contest, where several entries were played, critiqued, and eliminated.  Jay Moore, a guest, joined the conversation, sharing cruise stories, commenting on celebrities, and recounting an awkward encounter with Ron Bennington, which led to recollections of other uncomfortable interviews (Ricky Gervais and Louis C.K.) with extensive and highly offensive language.  The show concluded with further discussion of the contest, more commentary on Louis C.K., a brief mention of Opie's birthday, a closing segment about Exxon's profits, a call for "Project Mayhem," and Opie recounting a mishap involving a car door slam during a pre-recorded segment with Jim Norton.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better, yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 18.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fucking have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Anthony.  Happy birthday to you.  Wow, E-Rock.  Thanks, E-Rock. 
[00:01:30]  Was that an audible?  Yeah.  Was that your big surprise today for everybody?  That was E-Rock's big surprise.  I didn't know that was coming.  I guess E-Rock runs the show now.  Yeah.  It's E-Rock's show.  Yeah, because we wanted to just kind of start with the subject,  and hopefully the calls would come in on that.  Yeah.  Instead of 8,000 calls on a happy birthday or anything.  But, yeah, good choice.  All right.  There you go.  Eek.  E-Rock lost sleep over that one.  He couldn't wait to do that for everybody. 
[00:02:00]  Wow.  Oh, it's just weird that he doesn't tell anyone.  Yeah.  What a fucking ghoul.  That was a little.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, everybody.  Good morning to Anthony.  Hi.  Good morning to you.  Good morning to you.  Good morning to the people out there and our staff and Kenny.  Why Kenny?  I don't know.  He's in there reading the paper.  The paper.  You think he's actually reading the paper or just looking at the...  Looking at the pretty pictures. 
[00:02:30]  They're all in color now.  Oh.  If you turn on your news today...  Yeah.  You're going to see a lot of people talking about gas prices.  Yeah.  Yeah, we saw that.  Big story.  They keep jacking up the gas prices and the news is just biting.  Yeah, they're just loving this.  Biting like dumb fish.  I told you right before the show started.  If I owned a gas station, I would be $10 a gallon guy, so every fucking media outlet 
[00:03:00]  comes to my gas station and everyone could call me the big asshole.  You would have all the news there and this gas station charging $10 a gallon and they'd  be trying to interview you and just be going, I don't want to talk to you.  There's got to be a guy out there that owns a gas station that listens to this show.  I know that's almost an impossible thing, but I think there has to be one.  Raise your prices to $10 and call the media. 
[00:03:30]  You'll have everybody there.  Everyone will be there.  Great advertising.  If some asshole did $497 here in New York City, guess what?  That's where the media is hanging out today.  That's where they are.  They're hanging out at the place that has the highest gas prices.  The high prices.  Free advertising for you.  Yeah.  And then some dopey politician, where was that guy in Long Island?  I'm not even sure.  Yeah, I think it was Long Island.  Because the politicians have to get involved.  They have something to do with the gas prices.  Oh, they're going to bring them down.  This guy, I guess he has a podium in the back of his Subaru. 
[00:04:00]  So wherever he goes, he can look official.  So you got this asshole.  He's a politician.  You don't even know his name.  And he's like, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah,  rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah about gas prices as he stands behind a podium in front  of the pumps.  Yeah, he put his podium right where your car pulls up so the pumps are behind him.  And then he's got his cronies, too.  Yeah.  You can't just go to the podium by yourself.  Right.  You need some cronies next to you. 
[00:04:30]  And you're talking to the mic about high gas prices.  But isn't that embarrassing?  Like his people have to pull out the podium from some trunk?  Set the podium up.  Set the podium up for this asshole?  On some big oil stain in the middle of the fucking lane that you get gas in.  Got oil on his podium.  Then he has some kind of weird seal.  I don't even know what it means.  The seal of the great fucking county of shit.  Right.  And he's just standing there yapping about high gas prices with no ability to do anything 
[00:05:00]  about it.  No.  You know who the biggest asshole is in the area as far as promoting themselves goes?  Who's that?  Chuck Schumer.  Chuck Schumer.  I've mentioned this a few times and it happened again and I haven't brought it up on the show.  What did he inject himself into?  Just a parade, man.  Oh, yeah.  It was the St. Paddy's Day Parade in Huntington.  I know this is a little old, but now that we're talking about podiums and politicians that  are high and mighty, this fucking asshole walks down the middle of the parade route with  his people with huge signs that just say Chuck Schumer. 
[00:05:30]  But they're his cronies.  And then some of the signs say, meet Chuck Schumer.  Oh.  And some of the signs I've seen in the past have an arrow pointing to Chuck Schumer.  Like, no one knows what he looks like?  The guy shoves his face in front of every camera that's ever turned on.  But shouldn't he just walk the parade route and people should know who he is?  Yeah.  It's like, hey, look, it's Chuck Schumer.  And if you don't know, oh, well.  Oh, well.  But no, he wants everyone to make sure you're looking at Chuck Schumer.  Well, for so many years, we didn't know what he looked like because his head was buried 
[00:06:00]  so far up Hillary's ass.  He finally pulled it out and we're like, oh, that's what he looks like.  That's pretty good.  Very new.  Yeah.  So I bet you he drives around with a podium.  Yeah, he seems like a podium guy.  I want a podium.  I'm just going to put one on the Escalade.  And just set it up?  Because then no matter what you're saying, it seems important.  Fuck, that could be a good video.  So you could just pop a podium out and just start talking to people.  About some kind of issue.  And it doesn't even have to be anything. 
[00:06:30]  But you've got a podium so it looks really important.  Have a seal made up.  Right.  Some seal that means nothing.  Yeah, well, shock jockery.  Some crest on it.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you need a crest on your podium?  Yeah, you need a bird and some like stars and shit.  Some twiggy looking thing, like a twig.  A twig.  The bird's got to hold a twig.  Yeah, and then you talk and people are like, holy shit, this guy means business.  That's right.  Well, now when you see the podium on TV, you'll have a little chuckle. 
[00:07:00]  Fucking asshole driving around town with his own podium so he can say some shit.  That's ridiculous.  Hey, look at that.  He punches up some podiums.  Can we buy a podium?  Oh, man.  Oh, what kind of podium you want to buy?  I want a podium.  Wait, I want that small one where you just put on a...  No, I like the podiums actually.  No, I'm going to back up.  Full wood.  I like the podiums that hide your entire body.  Yeah, yeah.  Then you feel like you're almost in a womb.  Yeah, like that's a good podium.  Yeah, I hate the podiums that have... 
[00:07:30]  $2,000.  That's a good one, though.  Yeah, see, I like that.  I like the big blocky podiums because you can hide your body behind it.  And you can put a lot of microphones in front of you.  Those stupid podiums, what are they called?  Where it's just like a little shelf and then like just a little pole?  Oh, no, that sucks.  Yeah, you can't hide behind that shit.  You need to be able to hide.  People will be looking at your cock bulge when you're trying to say something important.  I'm not paying attention to what you're saying.  I'm going to get a podium.  $1,025 for a podium with no shit on it?  But you're saving $455. 
[00:08:00]  Oh.  Is it assembled?  We passed the savings on it.  It was like an Ikea podium where I got to put that motherfucker together.  Anything worse than putting shit together.  Who's helping you take this out of the car?  It's 150 pounds.  That's 150 pounds?  So that asshole that was in front of the gas station, it's safe to say his podium could be up to 150 pounds?  That's what his cronies did.  And potentially, sure.  Oh, my God.  Oh, but that's a good podium right there.  I think I need that.  I'm going to look cherry. 
[00:08:30]  Cherry's nice.  Cherrywood podium.  You an oak man?  Oh, I think so.  You an oak man there.  Jimmy.  I like the cherry wood.  Well, no, that's kind of.  My buddy Jimmy in Toluca Lake needs a podium.  Oak's nice.  Well, now we're down to $600 for a podium.  Yeah, $600.  Yeah, this one's $160.  Does it look cheap, though, the podium?  The picture really sucks on this one.  Yeah, that kind of looks a little cheesy.  That looks a little cheap, man.  We want something that looks like fucking solid oak.  There is room for papers to put on the podium. 
[00:09:00]  Well, let me see.  That's a little thin.  It is a little thin.  Yeah, but you can hide your body behind it.  But look, that one comes with one of those little reading lamps.  Oh, and a mic stand?  Yeah, it's pretty sweet.  And a mic stand.  That's not bad.  That looks damn official right there.  Yeah.  It's got three and a half stars.  Not enough.  No, look.  Not enough room.  It's small.  There's an actual business.  Where'd you go?  Podium.com?  Yeah, it's like fucking...  I pumped in podiums into Google Shopping.  Google Shopping podiums.  The last one we were just looking at was from Sears.  I didn't know Sears had a podium section. 
[00:09:30]  Sears sells a podium?  They sure do, because I already went to...  I saw two of them already.  Holy shit.  Fucking podiums.  Why are we talking about podiums?  Because they're cool and we're going to do some fun bits with them.  Very important.  Gas is pushing 450 and we're talking about podiums.  Damn.  The price of podiums have risen steadily over the years.  I mean, look at these prices.  It's ridiculous.  How high can you make your gas prices before they come down on you for, what, price gouging and  all that?  Probably, yeah, at this point, anything over 550. 
[00:10:00]  If you're hitting six bucks, they're going to start...  But can you be $6 a gallon guy so you get the media there?  I know $10 is a little outrageous, but...  You could probably push it.  I would like to get a podium and discuss the high price of podiums.  That would...  Wow, that was $3,500.  I know.  What do you get for that?  Yes, it is, though.  Does it suck your dick?  Are you making your speech?  There's a little hole in it.  There's a glory hole.  There's an oversized reading surface that holds a three-ring binder, heavy-duty industrial  casters for easy mobility.  Oh, man. 
[00:10:30]  I'd say the casters.  How much does it weigh, though?  Because if you don't have your cronies with you, you're going to look silly trying to  haul out...  Trying to haul it out.  Haul your 200-pound podium out of the trunk.  You don't have to press there when you're doing that.  To say some shit.  Looks silly.  I bet shipping has to suck on something.  Oh, my God.  Big and heavy.  Yeah, well, we'll get in front of the podium and talk about the high cost of shipping of  podiums.  Anything with podium...  Anything podium-related.  I can't even say podium anymore.  It sounds funny.  Psycho Bob says, send Bobo to give speeches from a podium. 
[00:11:00]  Now, he's the one-man band right now.  That's all I want Bobo to do in the near future.  One-man band.  It's the one-man band shit.  I wake people up.  We've got to figure out where the one-man band is going to show up next.  Yeah.  I'm thinking Starbucks and Times Square myself.  That'd be nice.  You boys need teleprompters to go with these podiums.  No.  Can we get one of those invisible teleprompters?  The glass?  Yeah, it's right in front of you and no one knows what's on there.  It's tilted.  Yeah.  I would like that.  You don't see it, but they can see it. 
[00:11:30]  Obama uses those all the time.  Rocco's got a great idea.  You would look like the biggest asshole.  Go ahead, Rocco.  That's funny.  Please deliver this properly because I gave it a lot.  Okay, here we go, guys.  I'm thinking about putting the cop on a Segway and then having a podium around the Segway.  And he can go around in Times Square and just spill his venom at everyone that has anything. 
[00:12:00]  And would you be Segway podium guy?  That would be great.  Where you go from place to place making speeches.  Where you just go on your Segway.  You can then stop and give a speech.  And as soon as the Segway stops, it is instant podium.  Now you're a podium.  And then you just Segway your ass to another location.  This could be the strangest opening to an O.P.  Anthony show.  When I drove in today, I wasn't thinking podiums whatsoever.  But then you see that asshole in front of the gas station with his dumb podium. 
[00:12:30]  I'm thinking, hey, we got something here.  Because we were just thinking logistically, it's silly.  A gas station.  You don't ask the gas station guy, excuse me, do you have a podium in there?  Right.  Just in case someone wants to give a speech at your gas station.  You've got to bring the motherfucker.  Well, when you set up that podium and the people around are going.  People will respond.  Are going, holy shit, some stuff is going to be said today right here.  If you're just talking, right?  Yeah.  People aren't really going to pay you no never mind.  No.  But if you have a podium in front of you, now you're saying something important. 
[00:13:00]  People are going to stop and listen.  You want to talk to a guy that actually, this is his gig?  What?  He rents out podiums?  Derek.  Derek.  Good morning, boys.  Hi.  Happy birthday, Anthony.  Oh, bless you.  It's not the only thing I do, but I work for a company.  We rent podiums.  We set it up.  We have to deal with these political assholes.  It's never them.  It's always a group of people.  I'll give you a great example.  My company did a lot of work for Cuomo when he was attorney general. 
[00:13:30]  And, you know, this guy's like, hey, I want to speak at this school and I want a podium.  I want some blue drape.  And I want a fucking, you know, model holding a bird.  Whatever.  We've got to come up with that shit.  Oh, so you're the one that comes up with the background and everything, huh?  Oh, wow.  They don't own this shit.  They have us lugging around.  Yeah, I got you.  So they call you and give you some specs and then you have to fucking set up the whole thing for the guy.  Oh, yeah.  So someone out in Long Island set up that podium for that politician. 
[00:14:00]  But what about the seal on the front?  They usually come up with that.  But there's always, they always have a group of people.  Like you said, they always have a group of cronies.  And they're always like, could you put it a little to the left?  Yeah, could you put it a little to the left?  Very important.  Podium placement.  Very important.  You want to make sure.  Podium placement, fucking where the mics go, how high the mics are.  I don't want it blocking my face.  Well, of course not.  You have no, I know.  It's a fucking thankless job.  By the way, I'm just going to throw this out there. 
[00:14:30]  This is neither here nor there.  But I keep having this recurring dream where I'm on your show.  In fact, I just had a, I know, it sounds like I'm a fucking madman now.  I just had a dream where me and Opie were planning a joke on Anthony.  And I was, and the joke was, I was co-hosting while Anthony was on vacation.  Just thought I'd throw that out there.  Wow, this guy.  That's amazing.  Should have said that in front of a podium.  You dream that instead of dreaming about. 
[00:15:00]  Banging a podium.  Banging young pussy.  Yeah, yeah.  That's wonderful.  I'd rather have those dreams.  Wow, that's an amazing fucking imagination you got.  I was dreaming I was a unicorn and I was popping teenagers in the ass in midair.  But you have a fucking dream about co-hosting a dumb show with me.  Wow.  Wow, Derek.  The guy did good on the podium thing and then he got creepy.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  It was like your Obama dream, Opie.  Sorry.  Oh, man.  Like you're doing good.  Like this guy was doing good with his call.  You really like my Obama dream, don't you? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, because it's just, it's so typical of what would happen.  Because you're like, oh, I can't blow this.  I need it.  I can't blow it.  And then Obama was like, ah, I need to take a hike.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Sorry, boy.  Thank you, Derek.  There you go.  This guy rents podiums.  Now, someone is suggesting we need a gavel, too.  For what?  Do you gavel when you set up a podium?  No, I don't think you gavel a podium.  No.  You don't gavel a podium, no.  No, you just use your voice.  You can't get carried away. 
[00:16:00]  Do you go with the microphone and then they have to set up the little speakers or you just  talk loud enough for everybody?  I think you have the microphone, but it's recording something.  Or do you have an area on your podium where all the local news stations and radio stations  put their flags up?  You just throw the mics with the flags on them and then you talk.  Oh, okay.  I think that's what we mean.  But you talk loud.  You gotta have that politician talk where gas prices must come down.  You gotta pound your fist.  Yeah, yeah, pound the podium.  So you need something that sounds good when you pound it. 
[00:16:30]  And the podium's gotta be, you know, it can't be particle board podium.  You need a poundable podium.  That's fantastic.  Well, you know, I mean, the guy's setting up his podium to talk about gas prices.  And then I've never seen that asshole before in my life.  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you gonna do?  Seal a president on me.  They got us.  It's a real deal.  They got us.  So we'll be paying a lot of money for gas this summer.  Yeah, I noticed they're doing something at these gas stations, though. 
[00:17:00]  Because people have said, hey, have you had the $100 fill-up yet?  You know, and I think I have had that already at some point.  But now it gets to $74, and it slows way down, and then it's tink, tink, tink, and then barely  goes to $75.  Right.  It goes $74, and then $75, and then it shuts off.  Why?  And then I'd have to slip my card again.  Seriously?  And restart at $75.  Yeah.  I think I did $77 the other day. 
[00:17:30]  I tweeted a picture.  I forgot what the total was on that picture, because I couldn't believe it.  Yeah.  Like, it finally hit me.  Like, I just filled up for how much on my dumb car?  There it is.  Rising prices.  It's everywhere.  See, $497 guy.  $497 guy.  $497 guy.  That's the highest.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you beat out $497 now, just for the attention?  Price is right rules.  Get up there.  People aren't going to remember that you were the guy that decided to be the highest one.  No.  Just do it for the fame. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Get a little bit of press down at your station, then lower the price, and people show up.  Oh, fuck.  You know what?  We are fucking up this whole thing, according to Eric.  Eric, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Isn't an elect turn a thing you stand behind, not a podium?  Uh-oh.  Is there a difference between a lectern and a podium?  Yeah, a podium is where you stand on top of.  It's like a stage.  No, we were seeing podiums.  Oh, we went to Podium.com and then.  And they said, yeah, Podium.com's fucked up.  A lectern.  What's a lectern?  What's the difference between a lectern?  Okay. 
[00:18:30]  A lectern is a shitty podium.  It's a shitty podium.  A lectern is more like just, it has a spot for paper on top that you read in front of,  but it looks very narrow for the most part.  They do make thick lecterns.  But I think that's more for giving a lecture at a, in a college or something.  Yeah.  Or a gas station?  Uh, no, no.  Podium.  Podium better than lectern.  Yeah, you know when you're looking at a podium.  Oh, that's the ruling?  Yeah, lecterns suck a dick. 
[00:19:00]  I wasn't sure.  I'm sorry.  Lecterns are for valedictorians.  Who needs that shit?  Yes, yes.  Well, what about a salutatorian?  Could you use lectern or no?  Lectern's like a music stand.  Did you say so?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, sir.  All right.  Well, hey, Jimmy, have a birthday.  Suck a dick.  Yeah.  Jimmy, anything?  Jimmy.  Good snows.  He doesn't feel like talking.  He's sad today.  He's over there crying.  Knows why the pump will stop at 75.  I don't think my pump stopped at 75.  Mine does, yeah. 
[00:19:30]  But it was pouring, and I did the old, you know, I put the gas cap in.  Yeah.  Because they don't let you just fucking automatically fill anymore in most places.  So I say, fuck that.  I take my fucking, my, what's your, the gas cap.  The gas cap.  Thank you.  And I shove that shit in there, and I get back in my one car.  That's illegal.  They don't like that.  Fuck that.  Like a savage is able to work that automatic lock to keep your gas in, but they don't trust  me doing it.  No.  And I'm cold.  Johnny, Connecticut, go. 
[00:20:00]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Uh, yeah, no, the gas pump will stop at $75 because the credit card only gets approved  for $75 when you buy gas.  Different gas stations do it different ways, but the thought was that at one point, $75  was more than enough you ever needed to fill up a tank.  Yeah, well.  They ought to change that motherfucker.  They're losing money because, uh, I leave after $75.  Well, what it is, it's usually the idiot kid that works with the gas.  I have noticed my friend's a manager at a gas station, and he already had, we're in Connecticut 
[00:20:30]  where gas is fucking retarded.  Mm-hmm.  But, uh, yeah, you just have to go in the system and change that pre-approval, but those  little stoner kids are too fucking lazy to do it, so they don't...  I gotta find that stupid picture I tweeted there, because I think I was over 75.  Yeah, there's some stations you can.  Maybe I was at a gas station that didn't give a shit about that.  I don't know.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's go to, uh, El Paso.  El Paso City by the Rio Grande.  Nice, El Paso chicken. 
[00:21:00]  What do you got, brother?  Yeah, gas and water is only $2.80.  You know, you have to, like, do the Bourne Identity fucking car chase to get around all  the fucking cartels, but it's still cheaper gas.  Oh, you go down to Mexico for your gas?  Yeah, that's taking your life into your hands.  Go down to Mexico?  Shit, it's fucking three miles from my fucking house, man.  There's the border.  Yeah, but, I mean, you know, you gotta worry about getting shot.  What the fuck?  Shit.  They had a shootout and it hit buildings at UT, El Paso. 
[00:21:30]  You don't even have to go to Mexico to get shot anymore.  Yeah, they're flying over the border.  Crazy-ass Mexican cartels.  What the fuck?  They're chopping off heads and throwing them at the fucking police station and blowing up  car bombs and shit.  Oh, and they're fucking in Acapulco?  What'd they have?  Like, five bitches would be headed or some shit?  Yeah, the beauty parlor.  It's great, Craig.  All right, thank you, El Paso.  Take it easy, buddy.  So, I'm on my, uh, I'm on my, uh, and I'm on my iPad, right? 
[00:22:00]  And I'm trying to find that fucking picture that I tweeted of, uh, filling up whatever.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  I clicked something on one of my pictures.  It goes to matchfucking.com and it's showing me all the guys available in my area.  Whoa, what have you been delving into?  Yeah, that's, uh, that shouldn't happen.  Do you, uh, do you do Plexi?  No.  People are telling me Plexi sucks because they do this shit with advertising.  What the fuck?  I don't do Plexi. 
[00:22:30]  Image hosting has got to cost something to somebody.  Yeah, well, I, I, what did I click on to get this shit?  Look at the men in your area.  Probably options, you could change your options.  There's some hot guys here.  Best part of living in New York City.  You could change the men in your area.  Picture poster.  What?  You could change the picture poster.  Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm absolutely gonna do that.  Change that.  Get the fuck out of here.  All right.  That's what I do.  I don't use that.  I use, what do I use?  That fucking frog thing.  Why frog?  I think you use.  Why frog? 
[00:23:00]  I don't know which one is the good one to use.  I've, I've tried them all.  Yeah.  You know?  Oh, look at that.  It's John Huddy in West Hempstead, Long Island at a gas station.  The cheapest gas.  For now, we're live here in West Hempstead, Long Island.  Dick, back to you in the studio.  All right, John.  You'll have to drive a long way to find the cheap stuff anyway.  The demanding answers.  Dozens of cars were banned.  I'm sure.  Shut the fuck up.  You're not 70 years old.  That's what 70-year-old guys do. 
[00:23:30]  Drive around.  They drive around to find the cheapest fucking gas prices.  And it's only a few cents cheaper, so you're really not making out on you.  And they will tell you, too.  You know what?  On the boulevard, I saw gas at $4.23 a gallon.  It was amazing.  I pulled in there.  Where is that?  I'll drive there.  I drove an hour to find it, but still.  Yeah.  I'm only paying $4.23 a gallon.  There's a line out the place, so you've got to idle your engine.  To save pain in the ass.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:24:00]  Just nearest gas station.  Right?  Absolutely.  Closest is bestest.  I don't care.  Oh, wow.  This actually happens.  Joe in Philly.  Joe?  How are you, boys?  Pretty good, Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Real quick, before I hit on my point.  Did you just talk about the boulevard?  Are you really coming over to our side?  I was just down there.  That's why I said the boulevard.  I was trying to keep it local for Northeast.  You know, I got this fucking cunt, man.  Whenever I do that, I put the, you know, like you were speaking about, putting the gas cap in the thing. 
[00:24:30]  She shuts the pump off on me and tells me to come inside.  It happens at Wawa all the time.  Why?  Because you jam the cap in?  Yeah.  I mean, she'll shut the pump off and get over the little loudspeaker and say,  Hey, sir, please come inside and we need to speak to you.  Oh, boy.  You're in touch.  Please.  What's that going to do?  I've never had that happen before.  It clicks off anyway.  It does? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  I just have a vision that just starts pouring out.  Just pouring out.  No, it clicks off.  All right.  Well, there you go.  There's the start of the show today.  Talking about fucking podiums.  Dump podiums.  We used to shove wiffle ball bats up, you know, up holes, and now we're talking about podiums.  Maybe we want to give speeches behind a podium and not a lectern.  Speaking of speeches, well, I don't know.  I went for the dumb radio segment.  Whatever.  This Trump, this Donald Trump.  Donald Trump is a douche.  I'm sorry. 
[00:25:30]  I know you're not a big fan of Obama.  Oh, certainly not.  But we certainly got to focus on the fact that Mr. Trump is, is, uh, you're going with douche?  Yeah, I'll go with douche.  He's being douchey.  He's, which, uh, he's not really being an asshole.  Um, or, or even a shithead.  He's just being a douche.  I'm going to go with jerk.  A jerk?  He's just a jerk.  Is he being a jerk?  And, and please, I don't know if, is Fox or any of these, uh, news outlets, like, 
[00:26:00]  going on the air and saying, look, this guy will never run for the presidency?  No, they're, they're all treating him like the viable candidate.  He's not going to run in the end.  Against Obama.  And the, well, the thing that's really given it legs, as they say, is, uh, Obama's people  are kind of putting him out there as their competition.  So that people will be like, oh, he's the guy that's running again?  Well, I got to vote for Obama.  I'm not voting for that jerk.  Kind of smart on their part. 
[00:26:30]  But I, I think the Republican Party, when they finally have a real candidate and they're  going to tell Trump, you know, settle down, asshole.  Settle down, or.  Just fucking.  Yeah, or they're going to push him out of the way.  But, yeah.  Man, uh, I mean, I love, I love Trump for, for the simple fact that he likes speaking his  mind.  I mean, he did it to us.  He called the slobs in the, in the paper.  But that's like, it's his shtick.  But now he's.  He's a shock builder.  Yeah.  That's what he is.  He's just a.  And now, uh, he's just going after Obama.  He's going after Robert De Niro. 
[00:27:00]  De Niro.  Seinfeld.  I think he went after Seinfeld.  He went after Seinfeld.  How do you go after Seinfeld?  Yeah.  He's, he's very, Seinfeld is just very generic.  I've never heard Seinfeld get political or anything.  He's just a very generic guy that came up with one of the, the, the, the great  greatest sitcoms ever.  Did he say something about, uh, Trump and then Trump jumped on him?  I don't even remember the Seinfeld.  The Seinfeld's a comic, so I'm sure it was zero seriousness behind it. 
[00:27:30]  Well, Trump has now sent investigators to Hawaii to, to search out, uh, some, some dirt  on Obama.  Enough of that.  He's calling him a bad student.  He's, he's one of those birther guys.  And I was reading the paper today that even, uh, Bachman was Bachman a big birther, uh, broad.  Yeah.  And she's even backed off on it and said, let's find other shit to, to trash Obama.  Yeah, because it's very bad for, uh, the Republican party to, to harp on that because it really 
[00:28:00]  isn't an issue.  And it's easy for the Democrats to turn around and say, uh, look, this is all they got.  Right.  And make them look stupid.  Um, she was one of the leaders in that whole thing.  Even she's moving on saying, look, we'll find other stuff to talk about Obama.  I mean, honestly, uh, I, you know, he's shown enough proof, but, uh, I would like to just  see him standing there with the original kind of smiling on, Hey, but I'm not going to sit  there and fucking pull this Donald Trump bullshit.  Well, which one do you want first? 
[00:28:30]  Trump, uh, talking about Obama being a bad student?  Cause that's the new one.  That's a good one.  I like that one.  This is like shock jock shit.  Yeah.  You would listen to, uh, Trump in the morning.  Trump is being a shock jock.  Trump with ya.  Right.  Uh, this is the latest from Donald, uh, Trump.  I heard he was a terrible student.  Not like, okay.  I heard he was a bad student.  How does a bad student then go to Columbia and then go to Harvard?  How does this happen?  He's a bad student, gets into Columbia, top, top school, gets into Harvard, top, top, top 
[00:29:00]  school.  He's a bad student.  How does this happen?  How does this happen?  How did it happen?  How did it happen?  Well, uh, that's how it happened.  Because they were grooming him to be president.  Right.  Since he was eight years old.  Or something.  Right.  And then, uh, Donald Trump responds to Robert De Niro's criticism by calling him stupid.  Stupid.  Did we get the De Niro clip? 
[00:29:30]  I don't, what did Robert De Niro say?  I don't know.  It's just it.  Like, I don't know what other people are saying to Donald to make him, uh, to get him riled  up.  This rambunctious.  Do we have what, uh, De Niro said?  I forgot.  I really forgot on this one.  Anything?  Let's see.  No.  Uh, De Niro.  What De Niro said about Trump?  Because now Trump is responding.  I just want the full story.  Trump's like calling him stupid or something.  Oh, here comes Sam.  Sam's wrong.  Sam.  Sam.  The clip has a setup. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, he does have, okay, it does have a setup.  All right, so.  And now this is Trump.  Oh, Trump's birth claims are crazy.  That's what De Niro said?  Yeah.  Robert De Niro.  And that's, that's enough for Trump to go off on De Niro.  Of course.  Here in New York City over the weekend, they've been having the Tribeca Film Festival, the guy  who started it, Robert De Niro.  It sounded like he, he was, uh, he did call you out.  He said, uh, a couple of days ago, quote, I won't mention names, but certain people in  the news in the last couple of weeks, just, what are they doing? 
[00:30:30]  It's crazy.  They're making statements about people that they don't even back up.  Go get the facts before you start saying things about people.  And apparently, uh, later he did, uh, reveal that he was in part talking about you.  What, what is it with the birth issue?  Yeah.  Well, he's not the brightest bulb on the planet.  I mean, I've been watching him over the years and I like his acting, but you know, in terms  of, in terms of when I watch him doing interviews and various other things, we're not dealing  with Albert Einstein. 
[00:31:00]  And you know, he can say what he wants, but the fact is that this guy has not revealed  his birth certificate.  A lot of people agree with me.  He's got to do a radio show.  Uh, the Trumpster.  Yeah.  And he has a way of doing it too, cause he always compliments you and then he fucking  hits you right in, right in the taint.  Yeah.  With a fist.  That's probably how he runs business.  You think that's how he does it?  The handshake and then the big Trump dick up the ass.  I think you're right on that.  Yeah.  So.  Wow.  Well.  Not the brightest bulb.  He's no Einstein.  No. 
[00:31:30]  And then I heard him like on another show, he was going, uh, De Niro, you talking to me?  Are you talking to me?  Trump said that?  Yeah.  Trying to do the taxi driver thing.  And, uh, you know, Donald Trump is having a lot of fun with this, but he's not going  to even run for the presidency.  And I don't know why the mainstream media.  Yeah.  Won't say that.  This is just a, he loves publicity.  He has for years.  Right.  He loves that Trump name getting out there. 
[00:32:00]  And this is a great opportunity for it because people are putting them on, on shows and  interviewing him as an actual presidential candidate.  I love it.  Stop it.  Because he's fun to listen to.  Yeah.  He's not that good to look at.  He's, but let's, he's creepy, creepy to look at.  Yeah.  You would think he would have figured out that hair thing.  You figured out the hair thing.  I don't even know what his hair thing is.  And you're not a billionaire.  No.  Uh, he will not.  Uh, maybe he's, uh, got a phobia.  He'll do the comb over thing.  And, and, uh, but that is a comb over. 
[00:32:30]  It's a comb over that's nailed down though.  Yeah.  He sprays the shit out of it.  He must spray it.  But no, I think it's nailed down.  What do you mean?  Like a couple of stitches or something to kind of wig?  I don't know.  But why would you have such weird hair?  I know this is hack material.  I know, but Trump's in the news.  Yeah.  And he's a billionaire.  And I, I just don't understand why he never figured that hair thing out.  Yeah.  He's a billionaire.  He could go in and get like, uh, the best of the best.  Some fucking B list actor could get his hair looking really good. 
[00:33:00]  It looks like the hair's coming from the back and wrapping around the front.  Like it doesn't look like it's brushed from his hairline.  But where?  See, that's coming from the back or something.  I don't know where it's coming from.  No one does.  That's just it.  Like what?  No one could figure out this comb over.  What kind of balding you think he has?  I think he's completely horseshoe bald.  Completely horseshoe bald.  And has grown a shitload in the back.  Well, how low?  Just above the ears?  Those type of guys. 
[00:33:30]  You know what I mean?  Way low?  Not way, way low, but low enough where the whole top is gone.  Wait, this is a guy.  This is a diagram.  Get some arrows.  From a guy trying to figure it out.  He's got arrows all around.  It's the greatest thing ever.  I have never seen this.  He's got arrows.  So some of the hair he pushes to the back.  Then in the back of the hair, he's got some hair that pushes over the top.  The first thing he does is take that little bit from the side and brush it around his forehead  to cover up the bald spot. 
[00:34:00]  And that makes a foundation.  Right, foundation for number two.  Slow, weigh the fuck down.  Yeah.  Start over.  Because I'm really confused.  All right, number one is the side, right there in front of and above the ear.  And then he parts that there, right about at ear level, and swoops it forward in front  of his head and forehead.  Okay.  And that covers up the world of hurt in front.  Okay.  Then you can't have that because that looks silly because it's coming away from the side 
[00:34:30]  and swooping around the front.  So he camouflages that with hair from the back that he brushes forward over that,  thus making a basket weave pattern.  Oh, my God.  And then three is your standard rear part over the ear, comb over for the bald spot in the  back.  And then four looks like he's just getting something over his ear to make it look like  a natural sort of where your sideburn kind of brushes back over your ear thing. 
[00:35:00]  That's too much work.  And then he must just spray lacquer on it.  Wow.  Someone figured out a diagram.  Someone did figure it out.  Where's the one with his hair blowing in the wind there?  I love that one.  Yeah.  Let's see what's happening there and if there's any.  I love that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, oh, my God.  See, there's much too much hair there.  Wow.  He's got really long hair.  It's long because he swoops all over the fucking place.  He needs to whip it around. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  Oh, boy.  That comb over is coming apart.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look.  Look.  There's no natural front hairline.  Can you tweet that picture?  That's a great picture, man.  His hair is all over the place.  Just send it to me.  I'll tweet him.  Fuck it.  His hair is going crazy.  Or big duties will tweet it.  We'll get it out there to the people because his hair is easily eight inches long. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got long hair because you need it to wrap around.  You need a lot of it to swoop all over the fucking place.  Yeah.  It's like a turban.  You got to wrap it around your head.  That is amazing.  It's amazing because he's a billionaire and I think they figured out the hair shit.  Yeah.  Unless he doesn't have a lot left because you need, if you have too much balding going  on, that harvest area thing that you did, this isn't going to work.  No, no, no.  You got to be a certain type of just thinning, a little thinnage. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  But he, I can't even tell how much he has or doesn't have.  First of all, the blondish hair makes it very hard to detect.  Right.  And then the way he's got it swooping around, it's crazy.  I don't know what that's like when he wakes up in the morning, though.  Because your hair is always at your worst when you first get off the pillow.  Yeah.  That must just be all over the place.  It's got to look like.  You think he gets up at three in the morning so no one ever sees how horrendous it looks 
[00:37:00]  before he works it out?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And just sneaks into the bathroom.  It's got to look like when Bugs Bunny put dynamite in Gossamer's hair.  And it blew it all back and left it bald on top and it was just hanging off the sides.  I'm with you.  Like a peeled banana.  I'm with you.  He's got to put all that shit back together.  Yeah, he's got to fucking one, two, three, four, spray the shit out of it.  Well, fuck, man.  I say to Donald, keep it up.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Some great sound bites coming out of you.  Yeah, yeah.  We're loving it.  But the second.  He gets serious.  He gets serious.  He'll back out.  Well, he doesn't want Obama to be president again.  And he knows damn well that it's...  He knows he's...  If he's in there fucking up any of the Republican votes...  Right.  Ah, you know.  Yeah, he'll do his damage.  It'll be a Ross Perot thing if he stays in.  He'll do his damage this way and then he'll...  Yeah, and then he'll back off.  He'll back down for some serious...  He'll back off.  ...serious candidates. 
[00:38:00]  Maybe he'll go stumping for people.  Stumping.  Royal Wedding.  When is this fucking thing?  Uh, Friday.  This Friday?  I think it's Friday.  Oh, really?  I thought we'd be on the air for it.  It's Friday, Friday.  Our Friday?  Meaning in the morning?  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's really early in the morning.  It's like...  Yeah, there you go.  Gossamer.  That's what he looks like when he wakes up.  It's like four in the morning and that coverage starts and shit.  So we'll be able to pop in, I think. 
[00:38:30]  I like your gossamer.  I really do, Anthony.  Yeah.  But Ted in Wisconsin might have one that's pretty good.  All right.  Ted, go ahead.  Yeah, I was just going to say, probably when he wakes up in the morning, he probably looks  like Bill Murray in Kingpin.  Yeah, that's a good...  All right.  That's a good one, too.  I think I...  Bill Murray's hair in Kingpin was hilarious.  I think that's pretty accurate.  There it is.  He's holding up the bowling ball and his hair is just flopped over the side, his comb over  hair.  There you go.  That's it right there. 
[00:39:00]  Bill Murray in Kingpin.  Oh, God.  That movie is all right, then.  All right.  You, uh...  Let's take our first break.  Got to eat.  I think it's just me and you today, brother.  Mm-hmm.  I don't think we got guests or nothing.  No, that's cool.  Jimmy's doing his L.A. run.  He'll be back Thursday.  And no guests, which is nice.  I like guests, but I also like to just chill out.  We had a lot yesterday.  Tomorrow, we got Bill Burr, Bob Kelly, and Joe DeRosa all in studio at the same time 
[00:39:30]  promoting their movie.  Cheating or is that what it's called?  Cheat.  Just cheat?  Cheat.  Cheat.  When we get back, do you realize there's a list of films that people pretend to have  seen?  Why?  The top list of movies people pretend to see.  They say they've seen them, but they haven't.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you just see it?  Or say, no, I haven't seen that one.  Right.  Well, I have been guilty of that, but I don't know why.  You do think sometimes you need to go, like, what? 
[00:40:00]  Well, I do it for the radio.  Because I want to go.  Did you see that movie?  I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah.  I want to sound informed.  That was great.  And then I realized, no, I didn't see it.  Yeah, I'll do it for the radio.  But when you're walking around in your regular life, you do that?  That's weird.  Maybe just to keep conversation going.  Because if you say no, it's like, and that person has nothing to say to you.  What movie did you do it with?  I don't even remember, but I think over time I have said, like, someone goes, did you see this?  I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm like, why wouldn't I just say no?  Why would I lie? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  What is this?  Steve in New York City.  Steve.  Yeah.  We're going to break, Steve.  But they're really doing this?  Go, go, go, go.  They're having a huge event in Times Square on Friday morning, starting at, like, 4 or 4.30.  I run one of the billboards over here, so it's going to be, like, on all the billboards  in Times Square.  They're having the stages set up and singing and all this crap.  For what?  For the stupid wedding.  Oh, for the wedding?  Why would they do that in Times Square? 
[00:41:00]  No one's going to know over there.  We don't acknowledge that royal shit over here.  Oh, for the limeys that are here so they can watch it on the big screen in Times Square?  More importantly, Steve, you run one of the billboards?  Yeah.  One of the electronic ones?  The biggest one.  How about a little Opie and Anthony shit?  Dude, whatever you want.  No, don't just say that for the radio.  Turn it up there.  I want...  Dude, I'm a huge fan.  I've been listening to you guys since...  Would you get...  I don't care.  I know you don't. 
[00:41:30]  Would you get fired?  Probably.  Oh, wow.  So how about we do this when you know you're finally sick of this fucking job?  Because if we do something in Times Square, it's got to be over the top.  Not just Opie and Anthony on 6XM.  Who cares?  We want something that makes people go, what the fuck?  Panic.  Radiation levels are up in Times Square.  Say what we have to do.  Can we get the Goatsy Man in Times Square?  Yes.  Don't make my dance.  Are you going to quit the job soon?  No, probably not.  I'm going to stick around.  Oh, that's a good idea. 
[00:42:00]  Cockpicks.  So we called you out on...  We called you out on the anything you want.  Gaping.  All right.  If that was in Times Square, you would have left your balls off?  Yeah, can we do a gaping...  I would, definitely.  Can we do a gaping ass cave?  There would be women with their children running like there was a bombing going on.  Wow, that is nasty.  Yeah, sorry, guys.  I mean, I would, but you know.  All right.  Then don't say anything for you guys.  I'm sorry, sweetheart.  All right, Steve.  God, why is the inside of an asshole so red?  It just looks like a fucking roadkill in there. 
[00:42:30]  It's horrible.  Henry in Jersey.  Henry.  Henry.  Henry's going to correct us on our Kingpin knowledge.  Uh-huh.  It's Woody Harrelson.  No.  Just the fuck out.  We just saw a nice picture of Bill Murray from Kingpin, and it looked very much like Donald Trump.  N-A-O.  How do you just skate on that?  I know.  You can't skate.  You can't skate on that, sir. 
[00:43:00]  You can't skate?  Because, oh, listen.  Wait a minute.  You can't just call it and be wrong and then just glaze over it.  Yeah, well, allow the second part of your phone call, but you're wrong about the Kingpin thing.  Uh, come on.  It's Woody Harrelson's got the hair comb over.  I'm bald.  I know.  How many times have you seen Kingpin?  Have you seen Kingpin a lot?  Uh, five times.  Well, don't, how do you not know that the, like, I mean, they both have really bad hair,  but Ernie McCracken is like.  Oh, wait, you're right.  You're right.  Yeah, I know.  He plays against, you're right, you're right. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Woody had the bald hair, but he had a few strands that he combed over.  Right.  You're right.  That's good.  Hey, oh, listen, though.  I've been listening for a while.  It doesn't matter.  Right, wrong, right.  And one of the things you gotta work on is your man.  It's gonna help you.  My what?  You're, you're man.  Oh, no, I don't have to work on shit.  Yeah, what are you talking about? 
[00:44:00]  What are you talking about?  You have to work on your fucking movie trivia.  Right.  Shut the fuck up.  And, oh, hey, I like it.  And your society needs to work, too.  My what?  I just cut your losses at this point.  I don't even know what he's saying.  I don't know.  What was the second part?  He doesn't like your society.  Society.  When you say society, but I don't know what he's saying.  All right, Henry, thank you.  All right.  All right.  Can we block Henry from ever calling the show again?  We just did.  It was horrid.  We just did. 
[00:44:30]  We'll take a break.  Yeah.  So we got movies, a whole list of films people pretend to have seen.  That's fucking, that's a weird list.  I guess that guy was a great caller for that segment.  Yes.  He's never seen Kingpin.  Also, we got an update on Flavor Flav's chicken restaurant.  Flavor Flav.  In the who saw this coming news, we got the Flavor Flav chicken restaurant update.  Yeah.  We got an update on that McDonald's story, too, with that chick. 
[00:45:00]  Whatever that was.  You know, I didn't.  They held a rally yesterday.  I still haven't seen the video.  Oh, the video's, wow.  Yeah, we'll do a little on that, too.  Wow, them sisters is beating the shit out of that white boy girl.  And finally, Ant, we got the finalists.  Nineteen of them we're going to try to get through today?  Wow.  We don't have to do all today, right?  You can do whatever you want.  All right.  We got most annoying 30 seconds of sound, finalists.  We got 19.  Right.  So we're going to go through some of those today. 
[00:45:30]  Steven Singer's got the prize for that, right?  Two grand.  Two grand.  Two G's.  Two large.  Very nice.  And on Lady Gaga.  Yeah.  Well, Lady Gaga again in the news.  She knows how to get some news.  She never uses a podium.  No.  From what I've seen.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Yeah.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  Today's theme is podiums. 
[00:46:00]  Looking at Fox 5 locally here in New York City.  And we're looking at Donald Trump.  Of course, we just did a little Donald Trump for everybody.  He's in the news.  And we noticed that he's got a podium on a riser.  Yeah.  A podium on a riser.  Do we have to get a riser, too?  No, that's very pompous.  Because then you need stairs to walk up onto the riser to get behind your podium for your big speech.  Yeah, I think it was a band playing or something. 
[00:46:30]  Well, if you have a band, then you definitely have to go riser.  So if you get maybe a local band, if we're going to be doing the podium thing around Long Island.  I'm feeling that.  Maybe we could get a homegrown band.  Homegrown?  Oh, my God.  I've got to write the book.  The whole shit that you have to deal with when you do radio.  Why did I have to play a fucking homegrown band every night during a night show?  And it's homegrown time. 
[00:47:00]  The only people that cared were the band.  Right.  And some of the family members of the band.  Yeah, that was it.  That was it.  That's all you were catering to.  But they wanted it to seem like BAB supported local music.  They supported everything local.  Oh, everything local.  That complete angle was just Long Island, local fucking Jones Beach reports and traffic reports that never went into Queens. 
[00:47:30]  My wife laughs at me a lot.  At me is the key.  At you, yes.  Is the key.  You want them to laugh along with you, but in my case, it's at me.  Yeah.  And I told her recently that I had to do beach reports, and I explained the whole thing to her.  She covered her mouth and goes, no, you didn't.  Yeah.  No, you didn't.  I'm like, yeah, I did.  No, you didn't.  It was outside the fucking men's bathroom at Robert Moses in the breezeway.  I had to get on a fucking pay phone because I still didn't have a cell phone. 
[00:48:00]  Oh.  And do beach reports.  Were you on the station that reaches the beaches?  Reaches.  Was that their slug line?  It's somebody's slug line out there.  Reaches the beaches.  Ugh.  What was BAB's?  I think it was just the WBAB beach reports.  Beach reports.  Brought to you by Sam Ash.  And some kind of fucking.  Right.  Whirling discs.  And I actually had, I don't mind going to beaches, but my gig was, I didn't get paid  extra for this. 
[00:48:30]  We all had to do it.  I had to hang out at Robert Moses all day and every hour do a beach report from the breezeway  on a pay phone.  That sucks.  There's no reason for that.  I had to give the traffic report.  I had to give the tanning index.  Let me tell you.  I had to give, I'm trying to remember everything.  Field five is filling up really quick.  If you're coming in now, I would suggest you go to field three.  Wow.  The suntan index, very high. 
[00:49:00]  Yes.  Bring your sunscreen.  Very dangerous.  What's the deal with Ocean Parkway?  Yeah.  Oh, and don't take Ocean Parkway.  Because they're too busy, you know, digging up dead bodies.  That just was, their local thing got so local.  It was just crazy.  And then I wandered around because I, every hour I had to do it.  So I couldn't even chill.  Couldn't have fun.  Then I had to get back to the pay phone early enough.  And just in case someone else was using the pay phone, I could make sure I had the pay 
[00:49:30]  phone because it had to be at a certain time.  Had to be right before the top of the hour.  What a fucking nightmare.  And then there was some dumb slug line at the end of it.  That is a bitch.  So.  All right.  The good old days.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  We've got a Flavor Flav update.  Flav, yo.  What's the Flav doing?  I was going through some of my pictures and I got, I'll post them eventually on my Facebook  page, but the day Flavor Flav. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, the takeover of our show?  Yeah.  I got some pictures.  By Flav and his peeps?  I'll never forget that.  Looked like a McDonald's beat down.  Yeah.  We were just, we were held hostage by the Flav and his peeps.  I think out of all the things we've done over the years, that's one of my favorite stories  to tell people.  Because it's just so bizarre that that happened.  It was the strangest thing ever.  Like, I want to retell it again right now.  Yeah.  Because there were so many parts to that.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  I thought it was odd that Flav was going to be there anyway.  Well, he was hot and he was doing our show.  Yeah.  But it was very vague as to what he was going to do.  And then it just started, it just started snowballing.  My favorite part always changes, but getting yelled at by Tom Chiasano backstage because  the whole thing was live on his.  Oh, yeah.  On his station.  He was like, you've got to end this.  You've got to end this.  You've got to end this because, and we're like, oh.  I go, Tom, you go out there and end this.  Good luck.  Good luck to you. 
[00:51:00]  Flavor Flav has the mic and he's not stopping anytime soon.  He is going off because he's the Flav.  He thinks it's his show now.  So we're just going to sit back and not be shot.  Right.  Okay?  Right.  You want to go out and stop it, Tom?  Yeah.  Feel free.  And, you know, I always wondered if we exaggerated as far as the amount of people that Flavor Flav  brought on stage.  And I was looking at these pictures the other day and there's no exaggeration.  Yeah.  There was 20 to 30 people that he brought on stage just to introduce to a very white crowd. 
[00:51:30]  Insane.  It absolutely looked like a lineup.  Like the entire first season of First 48.  Do we have that show, Iraq, in the archives?  I think we do.  I'm looking for it right now.  We might have to make some kind of special out of it.  Every character from the first season of The Wire.  Pretty much. 
[00:52:00]  Can we make some kind of special around that?  Because if you just play it, it doesn't make any sense.  No.  Because it was a complete takeover of our show.  Yeah.  But if we interject, maybe do like a mystery science theater type thing, you know what I  mean?  Yeah, yeah.  And explain like what we were doing at this part.  Being terrified.  I was hiding under the table at one point.  I went backstage for a while.  Just awful.  It was.  It was frightening.  Even our brave audience that has no problem yelling and screaming and shit. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They were well behaved.  Yeah, what happened to all the black jokes that day?  Yeah.  That people were yelling out.  Yeah.  The audience was horrified.  They just had their mouths agape.  Yep.  We should find some audio from that day and work a special around it.  Yeah, that'd be cool.  And finally put it to bed because we bring it up a lot.  But I think there's a lot of people that have never heard that show.  It's one of those great moments.  Yeah, because we buried that fucking thing after it aired, too.  Yeah.  I don't think any of that audio ever saw the light of day. 
[00:53:00]  If you got a few little clips, E-Rock, that would be great.  I'm looking for it.  Maybe for tomorrow or later today.  But anyway, we mentioned that because Flavor Flav opened up some chicken restaurants or  maybe one chicken restaurant.  Of course he did.  He opened up one and was hoping that this thing would take off and, man, he would be putting  Popeyes out of business.  What was it called?  Flavor Flav's Chicken Restaurant.  That was it.  Something like that.  Real original.  Flavor Flav Chicken.  Flavor Flav.  And wasn't it in Iowa or something? 
[00:53:30]  Some out-of-the-way place.  Yeah, he picked some place out of nowhere.  Isn't he from, like, Long Island or something?  I don't even know.  Why would you start in your hometown?  Flav's Fried Chicken.  Well, as you'll learn in the story, he's not exactly 100% owner of this thing.  Oh, I know.  But the other owner is saying that Flavor Flav took advantage of that guy when that guy  had Flavor Flav on all the buckets.  Yeah.  So that guy was taking advantage of Flavor Flav's notoriety. 
[00:54:00]  Could you imagine sitting with a bucket with Flav's big dumb face on it and just wing  after wing and leg, you're just eating it?  Did he have a chicken catchphrase?  A Flavor Flav chicken catchphrase?  I don't know.  Where's my Flavor Flav?  Is that a chicken with a clock around his neck?  Where?  In the upper right corner of the first picture.  No, that's Flavor Flav.  Oh, wait.  That right there?  Yeah.  No, I don't think so. 
[00:54:30]  I think it's a clock hanging off of the words.  You can't even tell.  Oh, okay.  That was the first thing I noticed.  He hired the worst graphic design people.  Yeah, that really looks bad.  First of all, it doesn't even look like Flavor Flav.  It's a cartoon version of him, obviously.  And then we don't even know what the chicken, if the chicken has a clock on it or not.  What's the line?  And then he's using that font, help me out, Ant, from the 70s.  Action movie.  Who was the badass Black Broad? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  With the afro.  Yeah, yeah.  What the hell is that?  I'm trying to remember.  Somebody will get it.  Yeah, yeah.  She was in everything.  She was a hot mama.  Like Jackie Brown?  Jackie Brown?  When they played Jackie Brown?  Yeah, yeah.  What was her name?  Yeah.  That bitch.  That motherfucking bitch.  No one's getting it down there?  Pam Greer.  Pam Greer.  Pam Greer, motherfucker.  He's using that font from the old Pam Greer movies. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Where they kind of...  Damn.  Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn.  Yep.  Giving the font some depth.  It's a lot of background shadow thing.  Well, here's your Flavor Flav chicken update.  Flav.  Hip-hop and reality TV star Flavor Flav.  This fucking guy again.  Oh, this guy.  Thank God Jimmy's not here today.  He hates this guy.  Worst delivery...  His boring droll delivery.  This isn't the worst guy. 
[00:56:00]  Not the worst guy.  The absolute worst guy is Ross Simpson.  Associated pro.  Yes, yes, yes.  Oh, this is a different guy.  Oh, it sounds like him.  Yeah, they both suck.  Hip-hop and reality TV star Flavor Flav won't be letting anyone else savor his newest venture.  After just four months in operation, Flav has shut down the Iowa-based chicken franchise that bore his name.  Four months?  That's all lasted?  Four months?  I thought it was longer than that.  I just want to say hi to Vincent Bayonne, because he came up with Jackie Brown, and then he goes, Judy Greer? 
[00:56:30]  Judy Greer?  And then I had kind of like an Anthony X mother-in-law, Judy fucking...  Judy!  Judy is the badass.  Judy Greer.  Jackie Brown.  Stop it or I'll shoot.  I swear.  She's making all kinds of right turns during car chases. 
[00:57:00]  Three rights make a left.  What Flav's doing, he's a fraud.  He does not want to be hurt with the other adventures that he's doing, and he's going to want to become a millionaire off my dime, off of my ideas.  It all comes down to a dispute with a man Flav picked to run the chicken joint.  I started this from the menu to the color of the way of the building, from the sign, from everything.  I started everything.  I have to do whatever is possible for me to save my name. 
[00:57:30]  And the only way that I can save my name is to shut the business down, because Nick Cimino is not running the business right.  Save his name?  Well, what do we think your name is?  What are you talking about?  Your name means shit.  That brand, the Flava Flav brand, is not really something that needs savings.  Flava Flav is basically running a Kennedy Fried Chicken and pretending like it's going to be the next huge franchise to take it.  Right, right.  Save my name.  They probably serve pizza by the slice there, too. 
[00:58:00]  My name.  Hamburgers.  Yeah.  Let me...  Hamburger!  Maybe we could all take a turn, but let me tell you what I think of when I think Flava Flav.  Yeah.  I think of that love show he did on VH1, and the women are all kind of standing around.  Yeah.  Wondering who's getting voted off, I think.  I think this was a voting off ceremony when this happened.  And one of the girls dropped a doody on the rug.  She took a shit.  It went down her leg.  A doody fell out.  That's what I think when I hear Flava Flav.  And a nugget. 
[00:58:30]  A nugget fell out of her dress and rolled onto the floor.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  That...  And you're trying to save that name, Flava Flav?  You got one when you think Flava Flav?  I just think...  Ugh.  Ugh.  He's just a little rat man from fucking, uh...  You know, NWA or whatever the fuck he was in.  Flavor of Love Poop.  I bet you we can't find this online anymore.  No, it's gotta be there.  It's definitely...  It's one of the greatest reality show moments ever. 
[00:59:00]  One of these girls that was supposed to be one of these hot brugs.  What's a nugget loose on TV?  All right, Danny will try to find that, but let's get back to the Flava Flav chicken update.  Why?  There were signs of trouble.  The reason why I pulled my license is because there's a lot of employees that wasn't getting paid.  While no one else will be able to experience the novelty of eating at Flava Flav's...  It's a novelty.  ...Semino won't miss the restaurant.  But I'm not doing this because of my 40%.  You know what I mean?  I could care less.  I'm just finally glad that I'm free from somebody like Flava Flav. 
[00:59:30]  As for Flav, he says his next venture could be a restaurant in Las Vegas.  Ah, there you go.  Las Vegas.  Flava Flav will be completely broke.  Hand out little grills for the kids.  They could put little grills on while they eat their chicken.  The Flava Flav grills.  Yeah, that'd be cute.  Did you find that, Danny?  I did, and then the website froze my browser up.  Oh, why would it?  You've got to find it all over again.  All right.  It's like, of course it did. 
[01:00:00]  There was something else.  Oh, we want to look at the McDonald's thing, too.  So we've got a few things.  Oh, God, that McDonald's thing was just...  I haven't seen that one yet.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's a couple of unruly women, 118, 114, got into it with a...  Now, it's called a transgender woman.  I don't know what this means.  They're not being specific.  I don't know if it's a transvestite or a transsexual. 
[01:00:30]  Well, the experts are here today.  Or a pre-op transsexual.  I don't think it's a transsexual.  What's a transsexual?  I think a transsexual is the dick is gone, it's been built into a vag, the hormone treatments.  Is that a transgender?  But I don't know if transgender might cover it all.  What do we got?  Let's write...  So we've got transsexual.  Transsexual.  Wait, transvestite.  Transsexual, right?  Then you have transvestite. 
[01:01:00]  Transsexual, transvestite.  Transvestite, right.  Right.  And then it's transgender thing.  What the fuck is that?  And what about the freaks that have both?  What are they?  That's hermaphrodite.  Then you've got a hermaphrodite.  Hermaphrodite.  So we've got to figure out four of these today.  But I think transgender covers everything.  Really?  I think.  Transsexual means you used to have a dick, it was cut off, and now you've got a vag and hormones, 
[01:01:30]  and you're, you know, technically a woman.  Transvestite.  And transvestite is a dude dressed like a chick.  Or trying to?  Yeah.  And, uh...  Trans...  All right, wait.  I'm...  All right.  So transgender covers all this shit.  I think covers it all.  Really?  Yeah.  Transvestite still has a dick.  Transsexual doesn't have a dick anymore.  Hermaphrodite has both.  Yeah.  No, transsexual doesn't mean chick with a cock.  Oh, no, no, you're all wrong. 
[01:02:00]  No, transvestite is chick with a cock.  Transsexual means it's been changed.  Transsexual means you've got your dick cut off.  Right.  Transgender could mean the same thing.  I'm just worried about transgender.  I think transgender is...  A general term, transgender, is a general term applied to a variety of individuals, behaviors,  groups involving tendencies that vary from cultural convention to gender roles.  Thanks.  Thanks for that nondescript cut and paste.  I hate the definitions.  That mean nothing. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, that really was Ben.  But anyway, this trans whatever was in the bathroom at a McDonald's.  McDonald's?  At McDonald's.  Oh, wait, wait.  Hamburgers.  I'll tell you that.  Before we move on, can we play this?  Oh, the shit?  Yes.  It's a long clip, so I don't know exactly how much of it you want to do.  No, we don't.  Um, I just want to see the...  Just the shit part.  I want to see the doody fall out.  Her doody. 
[01:03:00]  I think we got to take it from around there.  Oh, I think.  It's so disgusting.  And you know one of Flavor Flav's, uh, chicks is dating Shaq.  For people that saw that show.  I was all in.  Remember that girl, Hoops?  I don't...  I never watched that.  That's, uh, Shaq's, uh, woman nowadays.  I never watched that, motherfucker.  All right.  And out of frame for a minute.  But then she came back.  But thanks for coming down, y'all.  I'm really...  When she came back, she had this look on her face like...  That's my baby. 
[01:03:30]  Hey, welcome.  Cheers, man.  Thank you all, ladies and blessings, all right?  Have a good time, y'all.  Thank you.  After we do the toast, something takes off upstairs.  Oh, my God.  That's a nasty.  I smell this.  Oh, God.  Elimination is over.  I just want a sigh of relief.  So I take this deep breath and...  What is that smell?  My God!  It is. 
[01:04:00]  And as I'm going up the steps, I look down.  And I also...  I was like, wait a minute.  I know we don't have no dogs in here.  But they're on my stairs.  This is the name he's trying to protect.  I'm like, where did this come from? 
[01:04:30]  Something is on herself.  And everyone's like, oh, man, it's Nancy, it's Nancy.  She's pooed.  She's pooed.  What bathroom is she at?  How is it supposed to get upstairs?  You walk around the pool.  That's how you get upstairs.  That's fucking disgusting.  That's the fly where I'm from.  Hey, yo, son.  Hey, yo, son.  When she opened up the bathroom door, something jumped out.  Oh, my God.  That smell was something.  So I think I really gave her the right name, folks. 
[01:05:00]  Know what I'm saying?  Her name is something.  Yo, you all right in there, baby?  There was no way of me holding it.  I'm going to be honest.  I was like holding it.  And then out of nowhere, it's like my stomach was just like, bitch, you got me f***ing up.  I have to go to the bathroom.  So, like, it just, like, pushes something out.  Oh, my God.  She sh**ed herself on the Flav stairs.  And if they have a name, you bite yourself.  You can have anybody. 
[01:05:30]  Protect that name.  Oh, my.  F***ing up my clothes.  I like something because she's real with it.  She's like, yo, check this out.  Baby, this is who I am.  There's a wild gorilla.  I'm around, loose to that bathroom.  Oh, wild gorilla.  Whitey says that he's fired.  She picked on everybody all night.  If y'all smell anything stink around here, it's me.  Because I'm the f***ing.  That was good, that was good. 
[01:06:00]  No, but she f***ed.  Protect that name.  So, that's how the first day ended, folks.  Right here, only on Flav of Love.  With this dumb Viking hat on.  Yeah.  Wow.  He had a little comeback for, you know, 15 minutes.  He had like two or three really good years after it was over for him.  He's done skiing now.  Oh, very good question from Jordan.  Which lasted longer, Flavor Flav chicken or Pop-Tart World? 
[01:06:30]  I think Flav's chicken lasted longer.  And that whole Pop-Tart World, they just went back to the regular Pop-Tarts, right?  I think so, yeah.  I know they closed the Times Square place down, but supposedly that was supposed to be temporary.  Just a publicity thing?  I don't think it was supposed to be temporary.  I think they were putting it there, hoping it was going to catch on, and then they were  going to franchise the shit out of Pop-Tart World.  If it caught on, of course they would have kept it there.  But that turned out to be one of the worst ideas ever. 
[01:07:00]  A debacle, as they call it.  Remember the Pop-Tart sushi they were trying with the fruit roll-ups?  They had a huge Pop-Tart vending machine.  Yeah.  It's just because they have the M&M's store there, so they thought they'd be able to jump  in on that whole thing.  The M&M's store fucking rules.  The tourists love that shit.  I like the M&M's too.  No, but they like just taking pictures out there.  Times Square, by the way, I fucking hate walking through there. 
[01:07:30]  If I got to go somewhere like when we were walking on the Hard Rock, and I got to walk  through Times Square, it's so fucking annoying.  It's just that there's too many people, and they never know how to get the fuck out of  the way.  They're talking in the crosswalk, and then you just got to deal with all the shill and  fucking shims and scams going on that are still going on. 
[01:08:00]  It's really strange, because the rest of New York City has nothing to do with that.  No, no.  Not at all.  You go a few blocks, and then it's the regular New Yorker.  Yeah.  It's a big tourist trap.  They're always in the way.  I don't understand that.  When I go to other cities, yeah, I'll check out some of that stuff.  I'm guilty, I guess.  But then you move on, and really see what the city's about, you know what I mean?  But a lot of these people, they get a hotel right in Times Square, and they don't even 
[01:08:30]  leave the area.  They don't leave.  They go to Olive Garden.  Yeah, you're not even hanging with New Yorkers.  Yeah.  You're hanging out with other rubes.  Rubes.  Kenny calls them farmers.  Shills.  Hanging out with the other farmers.  The farmers.  Times Square, going into Toys R Us, The Gap, like you said, going to Olive Garden.  Why come to New York?  You can do all that in your hometown.  To TGI Fridays, let's go there.  Not only at TGI Fridays, Anthony, the biggest one in the world.  That's their advertising.  Oh, is it?  Is that their deal?  That's their slug line. 
[01:09:00]  And the crosswalk, there is like a family, and they'll cross the street, the crosswalk,  and not know where they're going right after they cross the street.  So they stop the second they hit the sidewalk on the other side of the crosswalk.  Meanwhile, this is like, this is where everyone's walking.  Right.  But they stop to have a little chat about where they're going next.  Move to the fucking side.  Move against the building.  Move somewhere where you're not in the way of everybody.  Tourist.  They don't know the rhythm of New York. 
[01:09:30]  No.  You got to know the rhythm of New York.  And then those guys that hand out the cards to comedy clubs that I've never fucking heard of.  And meanwhile, we have how many comics on this show on a weekly basis?  And we hear all the places they play.  And these guys are like, hey, comedy.  Comedy.  You want to see some comedy?  Comedy.  And they hand you these cards for a place that I've never heard anyone.  There's a comedy club like where Show World used to be.  And I don't even know what it's like.  I've never even heard of it.  Yeah.  Who plays there? 
[01:10:00]  Like Broadway Comedy Club.  And it's like, what?  Oh, Iraq's got a little info.  One time we were in Times Square with Norton and one of those comedy guys came up to Jimmy.  Saying, hey, you like comedy?  We got top-notch comedians.  And Norton's like, who?  And he just listed off some of these names and he goes, and then Jim said some line about how he's allergic to laughing.  It will kill him.  But they do.  They blurt out these names.  It's like, who the fuck are you?  Who are you?  Who the fuck are you?  I don't know.  Where's my comedy? 
[01:10:30]  Where's the McDonald's clip?  Oh, well, do you want the beating or her talking about it?  Because there's a lot of things we can do with.  I don't really know because I really have not followed this story.  Yeah, she...  It's out of Boston.  I know that, right?  No, actually...  Wasn't that one out of Boston?  Maldi Moore.  Oh.  See?  Maldi Moore.  I don't even know where the fuck it happened.  Yeah, and she was in the bathroom, right?  Sure.  And...  As a what?  As a woman.  Woman with a dick?  As a... 
[01:11:00]  Well, I don't know if the thing has a vagina or not.  Okay.  And she's in the bathroom, and I think one of the girls accused her of looking at her  mans, and then said that you look like a man, and just proceeded to start beating the  shit out of him or her, whatever it is.  Kicking in the head, dragging by the hair, the wig comes off, and then pulling by the  hair, kicking in the head, until this transgender person went into a seizure at the front door. 
[01:11:30]  And that's when the guy that was videoing the melee, who worked at McDonald's, said,  oh, you better get out of here, the cops is coming, you better get out of here.  So they fired him for videoing it and not leaving, or not helping.  Why would you help when two...  Well, one fat woman tried to step in and help, but that was to no avail.  Right.  It's just this fucking, like, you know, I always say behave, but just fucking behave. 
[01:12:00]  And so many of these things turned up.  I watched the street melee in San Francisco, I guess it was, where some bitch got fucking  bashed in the head with a high heel, and she's bleeding profusely, her tits are hanging out,  they're in the street fighting.  It's just some ignat shit going on.  It's great stuff to check out.  Chuck E. Cheese, on a nightly basis, I look at nothing but fast food beatdowns. 
[01:12:30]  It's great.  It's like an epidemic, you think?  Yeah, yeah, it is.  Why?  It's something that's just happening.  Because some people don't know how to just behave and have patience.  When you're in a McDonald's, you're not getting the best service.  I'm sorry, McDonald's, you're just not.  So sometimes your food order gets fucked, you're around people that annoy you,  but you just get your shit and you leave, eventually.  But there are some people that just can't deal with waiting, waiting in line, 
[01:13:00]  dealing with a staff that might have forgotten something.  It instantly turns into this violence.  It goes from yelling this horrid shit to just throwing shit and then to punching.  That's pretty much the chain of events I see when I watch the thousand of these that I have watched.  Have you been in a McDonald's recently?  I've not been in a McDonald's in, I mean, probably since the NAW days. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be 10 years, at least.  I went in one recently just to film some shit.  Yeah.  And I'll be honest with you, I was amazed.  Yeah.  By the clientele.  Well, they do.  Because when I was growing up, it was a different McDonald's.  It was families, suburban families would go there.  I had a McDonald's in my neighborhood, and it was a big deal when Mom and Dad would go,  Hey, kids, we're going to McDonald's.  And we'd hop in the car, and Dad would call me a faggot because I'd bring my little puppet that he called a doll. 
[01:14:00]  And we'd drive to McDonald's.  Was it a Barbie doll?  No, no, no.  I had made it.  It was a puppet.  It was a marionette that didn't have strings yet.  I was working on it.  You made it from scratch?  Yeah.  Was it from a kit?  No.  I just took some, like, fucking cloth and shit.  That's weird.  And shit.  Well, I wanted to make a marionette.  A little strange.  I wanted to make a marionette.  You ever see him?  I know.  And then you make the X with the wood. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  And then you attach the little strings to the hands and the head and the legs, and it moves around.  But if you don't have the strings, then I think my dad was right.  It is just what amounts to a doll.  So why didn't you get the strings?  Well, lazy.  Well, I know.  And what was the name of your marionette?  I'm a kid.  What was the name of the marionette?  I'm not sure it had a name yet.  It was just kind of a thing.  Did he throw it out the window?  Yeah, I think he did.  He did kind of toss it.  Well, he didn't want me to grow up to be a fag, Opie.  I would have been a fag if I would have had that marionette that he said was a doll. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  Yeah, so we hop in the car and go to McDonald's.  Without your marionette.  Without my marionette.  Because he threw that on Jericho Turnpike or something.  You're not taking that fucking doll with you.  Oh, Joey, let him take it.  It's a puppet.  It's not a puppet.  It's a doll.  Shut the fuck up, Ro.  We're all going to McDonald's.  Wow.  He said McDonald's.  I was happy for two seconds.  Then we hopped in the Rambler.  Then we're like, oh, here it comes again.  Here it comes again.  More yelling and screaming. 
[01:15:30]  What happened at McDonald's?  Nice little family outing?  Well, it was a family thing.  Yeah, yeah.  When you used to get your fast food and go to a beach, that was a Long Island thing to do.  Or did you sit at McDonald's?  I did that.  But as a family thing, before I got older, you'd just sit at McDonald's and eat.  But then afterwards, when you get a little older, you would do that.  What was your favorite fast food joint growing up?  McDonald's.  Mine was Kentucky Fried Chicken.  McDonald's.  No, it was...  Kentucky Fried Chicken was number one.  And then Burger King kind of sparked up.  Burger King was tastier, right? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That charbroiled thing.  I thought they were tastier.  But then growing up to the point where, like, you hit 18, you start drinking, it's all about Taco Bell.  Right.  Not Taco Bell.  Holy shit.  Jack in the Box.  White Castle.  What's wrong with you?  Jack in the Box, dude.  You get your breakfast jack.  Or you get your jack tacos that look like they were filled with baby shit.  Yeah, what is that shit?  I was the furthest thing from meat.  Thank God you were too drunk to give a fuck what that stuff really was. 
[01:16:30]  And then whatever you didn't finish, you threw against the window of the fucking Jack in the Box.  You know what that was?  And drove away.  I know what it was.  Why?  They had homeless guys in the back that pre-chewed the food before they put it in that shit.  And spit it into the...  They spit it into a big vat and then you had a Jack in the Box worker scoop it up with a ladle and make your...  What was it called?  The taco, right?  Just the...  I guess.  Yeah.  With that mystery meat.  Taco meat.  And then there was, when Roy Rogers first opened up, the clientele, not the clientele, the people that worked there had to dress in cowboy hats and Roy Rogers uniforms and had to actually, when you came up to the counter, they had to say, howdy, partner. 
[01:17:00]  And then when you left, they gave you a bag and they had to say, happy trails.  It just reminded me of fucking Hamilton and Fast Times.  Sure.  It's all prepared the same way.  Why don't you have a trout dog?  Were you an Arby's guy? 
[01:17:30]  I liked Arby's because there was an Arby's by the drive-in movie theater in Comac.  Wow.  And we used to go there.  And I liked Arby's until my sister had a tummy ache and we all ate Arby's.  And then she threw up in the car during...  That'll ruin it forever.  During, I believe, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.  And she threw up in the car and it totally put me off of Arby's for the rest of my life.  That was it.  Yeah.  And, yeah. 
[01:18:00]  But the McDonald's was, like you said, it was predominantly, especially where we were from, very suburban, very white.  There was never violence at McDonald's, ever.  And now they really are catering to a lot of ethnicity, a lot of Africa.  I think they cater too much to African-Americans, McDonald's, which if I was African-American, I'd be very angry that they're trying to pump you full of horrid food that gives you nothing but obesity and diabetes. 
[01:18:30]  But they're catering to, they even have this special secret site, something 360, and it's all about diversity at McDonald's.  I think it's black365.com.  Is that it?  I believe so, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I read that on a site.  Yes, Iraq.  There's a lot of McDonald's ads now where they're just sponsoring big, like, soul and R&B festivals.  Yes.  And religious events.  Essence Music Festival, sponsored by McDonald's and Coca-Cola. 
[01:19:00]  McDonald's.  What's our McDonald's menu for the 2011 Essence Music Festival?  Like, McDonald's has completely gone black.  And, you know, if you want to market that way, that's fine.  But then you've got to go with the repercussions of some people that, I guess, have grown up impoverished and disillusioned and strike out in certain ways. 
[01:19:30]  I love the families they're showing on this fucking web page.  What kind of stuff is going on there?  I don't think I've seen any of that in my life.  By the way, the Boston thing was two chicks fighting over pancake syrup at Denny's.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Over the syrup.  Over the syrup.  What is 365 Black?  At McDonald's, we believe that African-American culture and achievement should be celebrated 365 days a year, not just during Black History Month. 
[01:20:00]  That idea, that's the idea behind 365black.com.  It's a place where you can learn more about education, employment, career advancement, and entrepreneurship opportunities and meet real people whose lives have been touched by McDonald's.  How is your life touched by a McDonald's?  A heart attack, a stroke, diabetes, obesity.  Plus, you can also have a chance to win an exciting once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.  Some opportunities, I guess. 
[01:20:30]  So make sure you visit often.  You just might get inspired.  This word is like inspired and diversity.  Meanwhile, it's a beatdown going down.  Every video I see, there's never any inspirational moments going on.  There's beatdowns.  Is that Nick Cannon?  Did he graduate from McDonald's College?  McDonald's U?  Because he's got a diploma and he's got that cap and gown on.  They are.  I want to see one video of inspiration from this website.  Yeah, where's some inspiration?  Do they have a video section?  There's a basketball at the bottom of the page. 
[01:21:00]  Look at this.  Basketball slides in.  They don't really have it.  Check out what's new at McDonald's.  I want an inspirational video, damn it.  Well, the only videos I could seem to find are ads from McDonald's, which I'm sure star  African-American families and people.  What's in the opportunities section?  McDonald's, the brand of opportunity.  Hang on.  And there's a young African-American gentleman dressed in a suit. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, that's from the other thing.  Oh, that's the beatdown.  Oh, that's the, yeah.  That's what you, oof.  That's a bullying for behavior.  Yes.  That guy's just, it just says opportunity.  Oh, and then there's a video.  McDonald's.  That's where we get some of our favorite foods, like hamburgers, premium chicken, McGriddles,  and, of course, the fries.  Yeah.  But we'd like to give you a deeper look into our corporation to see all of the business  opportunities going on under the arts.  Listen to the music.  Our corporate diversity goals help build skills for professional development, allowing employees 
[01:22:00]  to achieve high levels of success within our company.  At McDonald's, we know that education is the key to success.  Vice President of U.S. Marketing Strategy is a black guy.  All right, now it makes sense.  And many of our individual franchisees provide college scholarships.  We also proudly support programs such as the United Negro College Fund.  Negro.  And the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.  Thurgood Marshall.  The entrepreneurial spirit is part of our community.  That's good. 
[01:22:30]  More than 1,200 McDonald's restaurants are owned and operated by African-Americans.  They look like black zombies.  Jackie and I.  They're horrible readers.  National Black McDonald's Operators Association.  National Black McDonald's Operators?  We generate billions of dollars in sales every year in our McDonald's restaurants.  Speaking of dollars, McDonald's also spends hundreds of millions for African-American suppliers  and vendors.  My name is Erin Johnson, and I work for Baldwin-Richards & Foods Company.  We have been a supplier of ice cream toppings and dipping sauces to McDonald's since 1998. 
[01:23:00]  Wow.  McDonald's is your neighborhood restaurant.  We make sure we understand and recognize and bring you the differences that make each  person special and unique.  A restaurant.  I'll send you to your table, sir.  Our restaurants reflect the people we serve every day.  So you see why we proudly say that McDonald's is deeply rooted in the community.  365 days a year.  In person.  In person.  In person. 
[01:23:30]  In person.  In person.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Yeah.  Keep fucking that chicken.  It's not a restaurant.  A restaurant.  Restaurant.  Wow.  They have a black McDonald's owners fucking organization.  I don't know about you, but when I go to a restaurant, I'm not sitting next to a homeless guy that's  taking a nap.  No, no.  Because he knows he can get away with it in the McDonald's.  Any restaurant I expect to hear, here, come this way and you follow someone with menus. 
[01:24:00]  That's a restaurant to me.  Right.  Not just, you know, walk up and point at the fucking board and have some inept asshole behind  the counter push buttons with pictures of the fucking food on it because you can't add.  Sure.  And if your chair doesn't move, it's not a restaurant.  Yeah, it doesn't move.  If you can't slide your chair in and out.  If you can't pull the chair out for your date, it's not a restaurant.  It's all plastic and bolted to the floor.  I smell bad.  I think we got a bit going here.  That is not a fucking restaurant. 
[01:24:30]  I don't see an appetizer menu.  No.  They never ask you, would you like to have dessert when you're finished?  A light board.  If you order off of a light board.  A light board.  Yeah, it's a, you look up and if you could order by, just by numbers, I'll have a six.  Whoa.  If no one says you're.  Chinese restaurants.  Yeah.  You know, you could order by numbers and you are sitting and it sort of looks like a restaurant.  Yeah, but I think that falls under the, it has to meet this criteria for what makes McDonald's 
[01:25:00]  a restaurant too.  Right.  So I think if, if you walk in and it's not like a last name followed by party of and then  a number.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No restaurant there.  If you're using plastic utensils, it's not a restaurant.  You cannot call up McDonald's and make a reservation.  Right.  If you have to go and get your own soda, it's not a restaurant.  We could do this all day.  Oh, of course.  There's no, if your dessert comes in a cardboard package.  Vince from Bayonne, there's no drive-thru at a restaurant.  Yep. 
[01:25:30]  If there's bulletproof glass, it's not a restaurant.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Bravo, sir.  Career development, entrepreneurship, education.  Nate Sack, is that how you say it?  I always fuck with your name.  Yeah, that's good enough.  Any place where you would rather eat in the bathroom is not a restaurant.  If you, if you can accidentally throw away your tray, it's not a restaurant.  Right.  If you, even better, if you got to fucking throw your own garbage away, it's not a restaurant.  Shit away.  Right.  If you don't trust me with a bottle of ketchup, it's not a restaurant. 
[01:26:00]  If I have to pump ketchup like it's, like I'm siphoning gas.  No kidding.  I love the ketchup pump.  Yeah, how valuable is that stupid ketchup?  Just fucking let it pour.  If we made that move, you know, some manager somewhere is like, you know.  Pump, pump, pump, pump into those tiny little plastic things.  We're losing a lot of ketchup bottles.  We should do something about it.  I said if you have to pour your own soda, right?  We did that one.  Yeah.  If it has a salad bar, it's not a restaurant? 
[01:26:30]  Nah, restaurants have salad bar.  Is there any other good ones coming in?  No plates, no utensils.  If the dining area smells like mop water, it's not a restaurant.  It always does.  That's Dom and Buffalo.  Holy shit.  Good luck to your Sabres, by the way, sir.  If you have to pump your condiments, yeah, we kind of did that one.  It's not a restaurant.  If you could win a free food item, it's not a restaurant. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, no restaurant I've been in has ball pits.  I don't go to a restaurant to play the McDonald's game.  I mean, I fucked up my own shit.  The Monopoly game.  If you're salt and pepper is wrapped in paper, it's not a restaurant.  It's not a restaurant if you could use coupons.  If there's a retard clean in your table, it's not a restaurant.  Yeah.  Paul H. in Connecticut.  Very good.  The floor is mopped while you eat. 
[01:27:30]  It's not a restaurant.  Oh, I love that.  When the retard brings the mop around, trying to shove some shit in your mouth.  If you've got to pay first, it's not a restaurant.  If my change gets dispensed to me through a machine, it's not a restaurant either.  You know what I'm talking about?  You get your bills back, but then there's the magic change machine.  Yeah, the change ride.  If the change comes down a slide, it's not a restaurant.  How fucking dumb do your workers have to be to be like, you know what, we've just got 
[01:28:00]  to get one of those fucking change machines.  They just can't get this right.  Jamie from Puerto Rico.  If you have to ask the manager for the bathroom keys, it's not a restaurant.  If you could order a meal with a toy.  Chris and Buffalo.  Okay, good, Tom.  Tom at PA.  If your spoon and fork are one and the same, it's not a restaurant.  Yeah.  If you have that spork. 
[01:28:30]  Please drop around.  McDonald's, may I have you?  Oh, God.  No one wears a headset at a restaurant.  Not true.  Really?  Where?  Not true.  Busy, busy, busy restaurant.  I've seen hosts with headsets on.  Really?  They need to be in communication.  Oh, wow.  Yep.  Buy me.  Matt in Iowa.  If there's shit all over the bathroom walls, it's not a restaurant.  That's a good one.  If there's like a changing station in the bathroom, it's not a real restaurant. 
[01:29:00]  Brian in Virginia.  If the fanciest thing on the menu is filet of fish, it's not a restaurant.  If there's two restaurants in one building, it's not a restaurant.  Yeah, I love the combo fucking subway, KFC.  Baskin-Robbins is guilty of that shit.  Yeah, they do the Baskin-Robbins.  What happened to Baskin-Robbins where they said, hey, man, we'll just take a tiny piece  of your place, please.  Yeah, yeah.  Let us sell our shit in the corner.  Just some ice cream in the corner.  If there's an indoor playground, it's not a restaurant. 
[01:29:30]  How about those triple ones where it's like the KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's the shiznit right there.  How about if you could buy food at a Target?  That's not a restaurant.  If you're eating at a place that sells furniture, that's not a restaurant.  Travis, how about Spike in Florida?  If there's a garbage can in the dining room, it's not a restaurant.  If you're fueling up while eating.  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, shit.  Yeah, the restaurant.  Yeah, right.  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  Burger.  Shooky-ducky, quack-quack.  Quack-quack.  Shooky-ducky, quack-quack.  I'll have the shooky-ducky, quack-quack and a hamburger.  Oof.  Yeah.  If a disgruntled black chick who is chewing gum, I guess, says, can I take your oda, it's not 
[01:30:30]  a restaurant.  Yo, oda.  Yo, oda.  That's Matt.  I just...  If you served on a plastic tray, did we do the tray thing?  Okay.  Yeah, there have been some tray.  Heat lamps.  How about if the majority of the menu is a dollar, it's not a restaurant?  Yeah.  I got a perfect way to end this.  Yeah.  Steve, you and Buffalo, if E-Rock is eating there, it's not a restaurant.  Oh, damn, E-Rock.  I thought he was unscathed through this one. 
[01:31:00]  Unscathed.  Almost made it, E-Rock.  Almost made it.  Mm-hmm.  E-Rock's a Wendy's boy anyway.  Yeah.  Wendy's is good.  It's not fast food.  It's good food fast.  All right.  Chris is a little confused by you today, Anthony.  Why?  Chris on Long Island.  He'll explain.  All right.  Let me see if I got this right.  First, they're shiftless, lazy, no work, and drains on society.  But then we get a place that's going to give them a job, and you're pissed about that, too.  Well, the job thing, as I see it, is, I don't know, I think it's a way to get some free food. 
[01:31:30]  That's why I see a lot of people.  I'm not talking just black people.  I'm talking whoever gets a job at McDonald's.  It's kind of like, you know, I get some free food.  You know what I mean?  No.  And the service sucks.  And the service stinks.  He just goes, no.  You go in there, and the service, if I hear, may I hit you, I'm like, I'm just fucked.  I'm going to be standing here forever.  Where the hell?  I mean, actually, I know where you live.  I've been in your house for cars with your brother. 
[01:32:00]  But what fucking McDonald's do you go to?  Because all my McDonald's don't have these people there.  I haven't been there in quite some time.  Okay.  I go to the McDonald's on YouTube.  Those are the best ones to go to, because that's where all the beatdowns happen.  And I love watching a good beatdown.  I'm going to have my Obi-Wan McDonald's.  Take care, boys.  All right, Chris.  He almost didn't get the invite back to your house there.  That's right.  He was pushing a little bit, I think.  Got to watch it.  I got to go back to Flavor Flav for a second, because I just checked my email. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, did he email you?  No, but Don Wicklin did.  Oh, Wiki.  Wiki was in charge of the channel back then.  Oh, that's right.  For the Flavor Flav thing, when he hijacked our little Halloween show.  Was it Halloween?  Yes.  Halloween show.  Yes.  I don't even know, because we didn't get to do half the shit we wanted.  No, we didn't.  Don writes, by the way, I had to pay his bar tab for his 65 family members.  Wow.  You want to guess how much that was?  Actually, the number's not that outrageous.  Cabassier. 
[01:33:00]  4,200 bucks.  That was on XM's dime.  Was it they actually paid?  That wouldn't happen now.  No, Don had to pay.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  But like, he was reimbursed by XM.  I doubt it.  Really?  I bet he was, but nowadays that would never happen.  Nowadays they would say, well, it's your problem.  They'd be like, why'd you pay?  Right.  Fuck you, you paid it.  Right.  Fuck you, pay me.  Kind of like that.  I kind of like that restaurant bit we just did.  Yeah, I like that.  Off the cuff.  A lot of off the cuff stuff today.  Oh, why not? 
[01:33:30]  Podiums and...  Podiums.  It's not a restaurant if.  Podiums.  We got Lydia from Oceanside.  Lydia.  Uh-oh.  What is this?  Good morning.  Oh, Flavor Flav takes over Halloween 2006.  Damn, yo.  This is almost five years ago.  I call it four and a half years ago.  I'm fucking...  Are these clips good or you just scrambled and grabbed some shit?  No, that's good.  This is good shit.  Hey, you want to run through this?  I'm flabbergasted by how quickly those years are flying by.  You want to run through this?  Yeah, absolutely. 
[01:34:00]  All right, we'll take a break and run through the flavor.  Oh, but Lydia's going to explain transsexual, transvestite, transgender, and hermaphrodite,  right?  Yes.  All right, Lydia.  All right, go.  A resident shrink?  A transvestite is someone who wears the clothes of the opposite gender.  It has nothing to do with their sexuality.  Right.  So, like, you're a dude, you still have your dick, and you're wearing, like, dresses from,  like, the 50s, because that's what I see on the streets of New York. 
[01:34:30]  But a transvestite isn't necessarily a gay guy, right?  You could be married with children in the privacy of your home, where your wife works.  Yeah, sure you can.  Stop it.  If you're a guy putting panties and a dress on, I say gay.  You're sucking dick.  There are many men who find it very comforting to wear women's underwear, but aren't totally  heterosexual.  Why is it comforting, besides the softness of the panties?  I would just be like, wow, it gives me a boner.  Right.  There'd be no, like, oh, it makes me feel pretty or dandy. 
[01:35:00]  I would just be like, wow, this fucking silky material rubbing on my weenie gives me a boner.  There's a reason why underwear is just horrible material.  It's to keep the boners down.  Right.  Yeah, that's what the cotton's all about.  Man, you slide up against a nice silky number.  Silky shit?  You're just walking around with a rod all day long.  That she's wearing, and fuck, man.  How do you not get a boner?  With zero absorption, too. 
[01:35:30]  So your piss is like, ten minutes after you take a piss, you're feeling drips on your kneecap.  You're fucking, God forbid, you shoot a load and put those on.  There's nothing getting absorbed in.  How do women keep the duty off their thongs?  I don't think they do.  It's just such a thin strip.  You don't think they do?  I've seen some things.  They've changed a lot.  Yeah, I've seen some things.  For the most part.  I've been in the shit.  Can you imagine what?  I've been in the nom.  I've been in country. 
[01:36:00]  Now, you've got to open your mind a little bit, because it's going to sound a little weird.  I want to acknowledge that.  Can you imagine that somehow the fashion statement is, guys, wear thongs.  Wow.  What that would look like at the end of the day.  Oh, God.  I drop off my laundry.  I try not to make eye contact with the woman, because just the shit that she has to clean up now.  Can you imagine if you have clean up shit stained thongs?  It's just horrible.  You don't want to. 
[01:36:30]  I don't know how they keep the duty off.  Always tip.  I think they, I think girls, they're a little cleaner maybe back there.  I don't know.  Lack of any hair, and then they just, maybe they change.  Maybe that string can stay so still up there, that ass crack, that the underwear isn't moving around to make it look bigger than it actually is.  Do they have an extra bone back there? 
[01:37:00]  Oh, to hold it away from the bung hole?  Yeah.  It's like fucking, like a suspension bridge over the bung hole.  It's like kind of a speed bump.  Yeah, yeah.  Something that just levitates the thong material so it doesn't really touch the bung.  So it doesn't touch the doody.  It's all about the butt hairs.  Yeah, I think it is.  I think it's all about the butt hairs.  Lydia, so.  Yeah, that's sitting, like, grunting on the ball from fucking, you know, bleh. 
[01:37:30]  Have you ever seen any of your girls' shit?  No.  I don't know how they do it.  When do they do this shit?  They do it.  They forget.  I know they do it.  I'm not stupid.  Well, I was going to say, they forget to flush at last.  I've never seen.  I know that girl's shit.  I'm trying to leave it in the ball.  Never a smell.  Never a hint.  I've never seen.  Any of that shit goes down.  It is funny as fuck when you walk in one day, though, and there's a little milk dud floating  in there.  You're like, ah, ah, ah.  There's always little rabbit droppings.  Someone missed.  Someone missed.  Looks like someone spilled their junior mints.  All right.  So transvestite is basically a guy with a dick wearing a dress, right? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  Is there a lot of women that do the transvestite thing?  Not that I know of.  Yeah, I don't think so either.  It doesn't seem to be a woman thing.  But what's the transgender?  But, I mean, we glossed over this.  I said this, but then we had too much going on here.  I'm not kidding.  When I see the transvestites walking around New York City, why do they pick clothes from  like the early 50s?  Some horrible...  It is like I Love Lucy dresses.  Yeah, some outdated dress. 
[01:38:30]  If you're going to dress like a fucking chick, wouldn't you pick a fashion from...  From what's happening now?  I think a lot of the transvestites that you see around the city are also transgender,  meaning that they are also interested in being another gender and perhaps a pre-op.  Most transvestites, you never see them wearing women's clothes because they do it behind clothes.  But once again, you're a guy with a dick and then you decide, I need to be a chick that 
[01:39:00]  looks like I'm from the 50s.  I don't get it.  Wouldn't you try to be a hot, fucking sexy chick with whatever the hell is fashionable?  You'd have to ask a gay guy about that.  I don't get that myself.  All right.  So the transgender...  And then the transsexual is the one where they had the operation, right?  Or wish to have the operation.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wish to have the operation.  You don't actually have to have the operation to be transsexual.  You can want to have the operation and be pre-op and be a transsexual. 
[01:39:30]  And what are you?  I'm all female.  You're all woman, aren't you there, Lydia?  You're all woman.  You're all woman.  All fucking woman.  I don't know.  I'm trying to look up the article on Chaz Bono because it was in the paper yesterday.  We couldn't get to it.  We were too busy.  Yeah.  There's some weird shit going on.  I think they're going to do a documentary on...  Is it OWN?  It might be OWN, Ant. 
[01:40:00]  Yes, on the Oprah Winfrey Network.  And she's taking us through her transformation.  Thank God for that.  She's now Charlie, right?  Thank God.  Chaz.  It's just Chaz.  Anyhow, guys, I just wanted to clarify.  Oh, well.  I guess you got to go.  Fuck us running.  Well, I guess you're busy.  You're a busy gal today, huh?  I'm trying to find...  Busy lady.  I'm trying to find something.  I'm so sorry.  Do you know if this person at the McDonald's had a penis or was completely... 
[01:40:30]  I actually don't know anything about that.  I'm feeling really guilty for taking my twins to McDonald's now after listening.  Why do you feel guilty?  By your twins, you mean those giant tits of yours, right?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, I felt so.  Right.  And the boys.  Those big implants.  Those givers of life.  Yeah, I'm going to have to keep them at a McDonald's now. 
[01:41:00]  I just find that so odd that a shrink got implants.  I think of that sometimes and think like that's...  Like, that to me says that you have a self-image problem, but instead of dealing with it mentally and through, you know, just having self-confidence, you had to do something physically to make people look at you differently or feel that people are looking at you differently.  Well, wait until I get my facelift. 
[01:41:30]  Are you doing a facelift?  Oh, are you?  Well, not anytime soon, but definitely planning for the future.  Oh, boy.  That facelift is very rough.  You've got to make sure you get the right person.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess that's true.  Otherwise, they could really do some damage.  Yeah.  I've seen it.  How are the tits, though?  They turned out good?  Oh, yeah.  They're holding up very nicely.  I'll come in and show you guys one day.  Will you show us the whole thing, though? 
[01:42:00]  We want to see areola.  Yeah, we want to see the nipples.  I'll tell you what.  I'll prove that Jewish girls have nipples that have color.  Oh, really?  Look, all right.  Then maybe it was the one I was with.  Well, yours is fake.  But the nipples are still real.  That conversation horrified a few people, but I stand by it.  The Jewish girls in general don't really have nipples that you can really see.  They have nipples, but they blend into the skin color to a point and it looks creepy. 
[01:42:30]  I think you were with a defective Jew, L.P.  And I'm basing this on one Jewish girl that I dated sort of until her mom realized I wasn't a Jew.  Ah, that'll do it.  And I was done.  No more.  No more opster.  Get out of here, you gentile.  Right.  And that was their mistake, for sure.  Oh.  Oh.  Brand new production by D-Boy?  All right, Lydia.  Come on in and show us your big Jewish titties. 
[01:43:00]  All right, guys.  Have a great day.  Hey, is the pass-over thing finally over?  It's over, finally.  Because I want to get my damn camera, but the J have closed up shop for a week.  Yeah, they close up.  I think B&H should be open again.  Today?  It should be, yeah.  I think yesterday was the last day.  All right, right on.  The Jews are back working, finally.  Jews are in business.  Thank you, Lydia.  You can buy your diamonds and electronics.  Hey, someone wants to talk to you really fast. 
[01:43:30]  Okay.  We have time for this.  Sure.  You're on with Lydia.  Hi, Lydia.  It's Irwin.  Remember me?  Irving.  Irving, you don't remember your own name.  Well, he's a bit older now.  Yeah.  Irving was the guy that kind of, what, molested you when you were younger, Lydia?  That's right.  You guys don't forget to say it, do you?  Well, Irving, you want to explain to everybody?  Well, Lydia used to wear this really pretty bathing suit, and I used to like to look at 
[01:44:00]  her, and I know the reason why Lydia got fake titties.  Yeah?  What?  Because she doesn't want to be a little girl anymore, and it makes her feel like a grown-up,  and then she can forget her past when she was so special to me.  Jesus.  That's excellent psychoanalysis.  That is a little creepy.  You were wearing that sexy bathing suit, though.  That's what did it, right?  That's right.  My eight-year-old body just pinned him on. 
[01:44:30]  It was your fault for wearing the sexy bathing suit.  That's what the judge said.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hear you.  I hear you.  Her little, her little ass cheeks would hang out, and she would tease me on purpose.  All right, guys.  It's been a blast.  Yeah.  Don't go.  Don't go.  You know we're back together again.  She want to relive this.  This always makes Lydia hang up by a lot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:45:00]  She likes to play hard to get what she did when she was eight.  Don't do it again.  Oh, Lydia.  Lydia.  Lydia can't handle that.  Lydia doesn't like that.  Irving, you're going to have to call when Uncle Paul's in.  Oh, we lost Irving?  Yeah.  Okay.  I think he hung up.  Oh, my God.  So we'll do this production piece into break.  That's great.  Netflix looking great.  Pre-market there, by the way, Danny.  Is it?  Down $16.25. 
[01:45:30]  Nothing I could do.  Is that good or bad for you guys?  Pretty bad.  Pretty bad?  Yeah.  You know, why would stock go up with a huge earnings report?  Ah, because they decided next quarter might not be as good as this quarter that just blew  away everything.  When you're going to be the number one subscribed to service, period.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what happened.  Your stock should take a 5% dump, obviously.  I don't know what happened either.  But, eh, whatever.  What are you going to do?  Lose money. 
[01:46:00]  Lose some money.  Lose money.  Okay.  What are you going to do?  Lose money.  Lose money.  Good point.  Be awful all day.  Want to punch people in the fucking face.  All right.  Good point.  It is just awful, man.  Lots to do when we get back.  Flavor, Flavor Audio.  Flav.  From the big hijack that happened four and a half years ago.  Wow.  Fuck.  And then we got the most annoying 30 seconds.  We got the finalists right in front of us here.  Oh, yeah.  And we got this right now, though. 
[01:46:30]  Sheriff, it looks like we found another body.  This is the third one this week.  I think it's about time we call in the FBI.  Somewhere out there, a killer is on the loose.  Why, yes, Sheriff.  I have been following that story in the papers.  It used to be such a peaceful little town.  And there's only one man who can catch him.  Now, don't you worry.  I'm going to send my best man down there to help you in your investigation. 
[01:47:00]  But he was busy.  Here comes fucking ferret face.  Whatever.  All right, Agent Voss.  Someone's out there murdering innocent women.  I want you to go down there and assist the local sheriff.  You're one of the bad.  Get down there and help the sheriff.  How could he be a profiler?  His vocabulary is so bad.  Yeah, but no one listens.  This summer, the Opie and Anthony show presents a comedy about an idiotic comedian pretending to be an FBI agent.  So you work a lot of murders before? 
[01:47:30]  Now we're doing mainly a lot on terrorists and terrorist type threats and stuff like that.  But, you know, back in the day, it was more murders.  What are some of the cases you worked on?  Just, you know, Seattle, the Green River.  What do you call it?  Look, I can't talk a lot about it.  I don't get this much in detail.  Starring Jim Norton.  He just keeps saying profile, profiler, other profilers, profile.  And Rich Voss.  Great minds think a lot.  I'm like, oh my God.  The Profiler.  Coming to a theater nowhere near you or anyone else. 
[01:48:00]  Thank baby Jesus.  Attention anglers.  Still convinced that fishing is a sport?  Well, renowned sportsman James Norton presents the ultimate cure for your delusion.  How smart do you have to be to beat this animal psychologically?  What a dumb animal the fish is.  Introducing, fishing is not a sport, you douche.  It's not a sport.  It's not a sport.  Go in the water with your fists and punch the fish.  That's a sport.  You're standing in a fucking boat.  It's not a sport.  You have a hook and the fish has nothing but hunger. 
[01:48:30]  This collection is presented on nine full-length high-fidelity audio cassettes.  And will thoroughly convince you that your leisure activity is a colossal waste of time.  You and some other jizz bucket and fucking waders and a big gut standing there in ten-degree water,  stricking Pabst Blue Ribbon, trying to hook some asshole fish.  You're not a sportsman.  You're not out there sporting.  Despite what you may think, fishing is not a battle of wits.  It's not stacked equally between a dumb fucking fish who has been doing the same thing since dinosaurs were shitting all over Manhattan. 
[01:49:00]  Do you understand?  That fish was no smarter when a tyrannosaurus was shitting on 70th Street and Broadway.  Put down that stupid fishing pole and pick up your copies of Fishing is Not a Sport, you douche.  Narrated by James Norton.  I'm just letting you know, you're not a sportsman.  Sirius XM, the virus.  Yeah, this is the O.P.D. Anthony Show.  Damn it. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is this?  It is the Beastie Boys?  What song?  She's crafty.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know without the words.  All right, O.P. and Anthony.  And remember, I was talking about the Chaz story.  I'm throwing on my West Side gang signs. 
[01:50:00]  Hold on.  Wow, you could do that shit?  West Side, West Side.  How do you fucking...  You gotta go West Side, West Side.  Is that it?  Yeah, you're West Side.  Tuck that thumb in though, yo.  You don't want to be like fucking West Side with a thumb.  That might get you a shot or something.  But what about my deformed pinky?  Does that fuck up the gang sign?  Look at that tiny pinky of mine.  Yeah, it's kind of West Side.  I don't know.  It's a weak West Side. 
[01:50:30]  West Side.  So you got this Chastity Bono, right?  This is from yesterday.  Just really quickly, because some of this stuff in this article creeped me out a little bit.  I guess there's going to be a documentary on OWN about Chastity Bono.  Who was the cute...  Oprah Winfrey Network?  Oprah Winfrey Network.  Yes.  Yeah.  Our old boss works there, you know.  Of course, yes.  Unrecognizable at this point.  E of the low.  Is unrecognizable.  Why?  Because he looks all happy and young and... 
[01:51:00]  He's...  Healthy.  I would love to know how much weight he dropped since leaving Exxon.  AIDS?  No.  No?  No.  Healthy weight loss?  He's bought into the Oprah, you know, lifestyle thing.  Even without drinking.  Even though Oprah herself decided to stay fat.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone around her gets healthier for some reason.  Slim and trim.  They get very spiritual, I think.  I think him just leaving satellite radio helped him a thousand percent.  And now he runs.  Maybe it's just us.  You ever notice any boss that goes away from us for any length of time just looks great 
[01:51:30]  after you see him?  You see him a few months later and you're like, wow, that guy looks great.  He looks healthy and younger.  I actually saw Ken Stevens.  Ken Stevens is the guy...  He hopped on a boat and just decided to be a pirate.  No joke after we got him fired and he had to retire early.  Sorry.  He was bloated.  Sorry, Ken.  He had like a fucking...  A red nose.  He had rosacea.  I don't know what the fuck was going on with him.  Sorry, Ken.  But I...  When I was driving through Washington, I stopped and had a steak dinner with a guy. 
[01:52:00]  We've talked about this.  The guy easily looked ten years younger.  Oh, yeah.  And that's being safe.  It could be close to 15 years younger than when he was working with us.  It was unbelievable.  That's what happens when you get the weight of me and you off of someone's back.  They just go like, ah.  I'm waiting for him outside the steak joint.  He pulls up in this ridiculous sports car.  Oh, yeah.  Pops out.  No beer belly.  Nothing.  Living the life.  And then you get this Jeremy down the hall who doesn't even want to say hi to us anymore.  What the fuck's that about? 
[01:52:30]  I don't know.  He's scared of us.  Well, we got him kind of fired.  We used to be really close with the guy.  He works here and he can barely wave hi to us.  What happens when you get people thrown out of their pain gig?  Might be onto something.  Now you get the Elo who's dropped easily 50 pounds.  Elo looks a little too thin right there.  And he wears pink power shirts.  He looks like David Bowie in the 70s.  Wow, really?  What's going on?  He looks a little too skinny. 
[01:53:00]  I think Elo's dropped a little too much weight.  He changed his lifestyle.  I liked the alcohol bloated.  Look at the alcohol bloated face.  With his retard hair.  Remember his retard haircut?  I forgot about that.  That's the same guy.  Oprah whipped him into shape.  Look at him.  He's got a horrible double chin.  Look at this guy.  The retard hair.  He's got a pelican neck.  Oh my God.  And now look at him.  He almost looks like a GQ model, this fucking guy.  Yeah, now his hair is all gelled nicely.  Gelled a little spiked just enough to say, hey, I'm happening. 
[01:53:30]  It's like week three on American Idol when they just like...  Right, right.  The makeover and you're like, was that person even auditioning?  Can you do a split screen?  I will tweet that today.  Yeah, yeah, definitely do a split screen.  Find the best pictures, though.  Just don't assume those are the two best.  That retard fat hair.  Yeah, this is how he looked when he works as our boss.  Yeah.  He leaves and he looks like a completely different person. 
[01:54:00]  He looks like $1.380.  Look at...  All right.  Oh, you can't open up two browsers at once.  Oh my God, Travis.  He'll figure that out.  So, anyway...  Somebody named Mr. Ross that knows how to do that.  Oh, own.  That's why we're talking about this.  Yes, own.  So there's a documentary about Chastity becoming Chaz.  Yeah.  Chastity was, you know, just a little girl.  A little girl.  A young girl that wanted a penis, Sam. 
[01:54:30]  Cute little girl.  Yeah, yeah.  When she was on TV.  They used to drag her out on that Sonny and Cher nitty gritty hour variety show.  And she grew up to be a beast.  Yeah.  Nice person, I hear, but she's beastly.  That's what you get when your mom is Cher.  And she's someone that certainly looks much better as a guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anyway...  No, I think she just looks the same.  No.  I really think she looks the same. 
[01:55:00]  The film begins by introducing viewers to Chaz, who looks every bit like a guy.  He has a beautiful live-in girlfriend, Jenny, who's in graduate school and battling alcoholism.  All right.  Nice combo.  While trying to figure out how a lesbian ended up having a man for a lover.  She's even moved into another bedroom.  Really?  So wouldn't Chaz say, get the fuck out?  Yeah, I would think so.  Chaz just shares money and you have nothing to do with this.  Go find your own place to fucking sleep.  Exactly.  We learned that Chaz has been on testosterone, hormonal therapy, for months. 
[01:55:30]  And as a result, ready for this?  Now has the beginnings of a beard, muscular arms, and an alarmingly growing gut.  Alarmingly growing gut.  I got to see this.  Chaz is also developing macho man traits, such as impatience, aggression.  And this creeped me out.  In a sex drive, that's shifted into overdrive.  Oh, shit.  So that beast wants to fucking lay on top of things now. 
[01:56:00]  You're not taking any hormones there, are you?  I've seen you because of the beard.  Who, Iraq?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  And him getting a little testy.  And, well, you know, the gut.  Maybe a little bit.  You shaved your beard, Iraq.  Yeah, I did.  You did.  What's wrong with you?  It was the day after we fucking went off on the author.  It was actually the day before Easter.  Oh, it was?  Yeah.  It wasn't going to fly anymore.  No.  Oh, my God.  I would not recognize Elo walking down the street.  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:56:30]  I would not recognize him walking down the street.  It looks like Max Headroom in that photo.  Look, he's got a chiseled chin now.  Yes.  He didn't even have a chin when he worked for XF.  His features are all chiseled and not, and then the other one, he looks like, he looks  like that guy's retarded brother.  Like, if Elo had a brother that was a retard.  Right.  That would be the old Elo.  Now I believe in those commercials, those diet commercials where they showed the before  and after.  Yeah.  Because there's one we do know.  We do know that person.  It's not twins or anything. 
[01:57:00]  What happened to him?  That's the same fucking guy.  Look, there's a brightness in his eyes that was never there.  There was always a dead, dull look in his eyes.  Lifeless eyes, like a doll's eyes.  How do I do that?  How do we tweet that?  Do I have to take a picture of that?  God, that's perfect.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  I think...  All right, you figure that out.  If you could email it to me, that'd be great.  He looks like he could be modeling fucking menswear.  It's bizarre.  That's the same guy.  No wonder he doesn't return my calls anymore.  Thank God he got out of here. 
[01:57:30]  Why would he return my calls if that's how he looks?  Yeah, he's working for the richest woman in the world.  The most powerful woman in the world.  He looks all great now.  He went from working with us...  Yeah.  ...because he didn't really acknowledge the other shows.  No.  Sorry for all the other shows at XM.  He didn't really acknowledge any of you guys.  So he went from working with us to the most powerful woman in the world.  In the world.  And she did a makeover on it.  I bet she did a makeover.  You think?  He never seemed smart enough to do it himself. 
[01:58:00]  What?  Or having the fucking fashion sensibility.  Well, he didn't want to.  No.  He didn't give a fuck what people thought of him.  No, that's just it.  I bet she went like, look...  Look at the...  Could you bring in Eric Logan?  Priceless.  Could you bring in Eric Logan, please?  I want to talk to him.  Oh, Oprah wants to talk to me.  Sit down, Eric.  Look, you're a fucking disaster.  And I can't have that.  Did he have a hair transplant?  Like...  I don't know.  His hair looks like... 
[01:58:30]  Really good.  Different and good.  And like it fits him well.  Like you can see his cheekbones now.  Look how bloated he was when he was working here.  You can see like...  Just like alcohol bloat.  You can see like a chiseled chin.  Even his nose looks different.  Did he have a...  Like a superhero before they put their superhero costume on.  Did he get a nose job?  I don't know.  Look at it.  It does look slimmer, doesn't it?  But then again, everything does.  And his skin doesn't look as blotchy.  And he's not making that dumb double chin smile. 
[01:59:00]  He used to have blotchy skin.  He had Elton John wig hair.  The old Elton John wig when Elton first got a wig.  Now GQ.  I understand why you don't talk to me anymore.  Now it's very, very evident.  It's obvious.  Okay, so we get back to Chaz doing a little documentary for O.  Since Chaz is the producer of this movie, you might think he would only show himself in the best possible light.  Which is no light at all, by the way. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  See?  And you'd be wrong.  In fact, Chaz is not just coming out.  He's barreling out after a life of depression, unhappiness, and substance abuse.  And he's letting it all literally hang out.  From the giant gut to his newly furry backside.  What?  He's happy that his backside's got some fur on it now.  Oh, some hair on that fucking, a hairy ass.  Chaz Bono is happy with its hair ass. 
[02:00:00]  Wow.  He even takes us with him to have his very large breasts removed.  Whoa.  And then later, to a transgender convention, he leaves the convention discouraged because  they haven't figured out how to make a functioning penis yet, he says.  That is a bitch right there.  Well, when you have the, where is that, when you have the sex drive that has shifted into  overdrive, you need a functioning penis made for you. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Those two go together.  Side by side there.  Well, it...  I don't think it'll work.  I'm working on paint here.  What are you, Microsoft Paint?  We don't, we don't exactly get Photoshopped on, on, on every computer.  Get anything.  Uh, Anthony, uh, and how does Chazzy's girly mom, Cher, and his stepmom, Republican Congresswoman,  Mary Bono Mack, who both appear in the film, feel about all this?  Surprisingly, the Congresswoman is more comfortable with Chazzy's new gender than the artsy Hollywood  diva.  That doesn't, that isn't surprising at all.  Who still calls Chaz her. 
[02:01:00]  That's not surprising.  It came out of her fucking womb.  Yeah, she should have an open mind about that.  That mother's kind of just like, fuck it, who cares what this one does?  Cher is huge in the gay community, so she should have a, a big time open mind about  this, don't you think?  That's great.  I bet you're, um, all for, uh, interracial, uh, couples too, right?  Who, me?  Yeah.  I'm talking about Cher.  No, but I mean, it doesn't bother you, right?  Not really.  Yeah, what if you had a daughter?  I'll deal with it then.  See, that's what I mean.  You could preach one thing.  Look.  That open-mindedness, but when it happens to you, you're kind of like, rrrr, rrr, rrr, rrr. 
[02:01:30]  Is the guy, uh, an athlete?  No, he's a thug.  Well, that'd be, that'd be rough, because he's a thug.  What about a mischievous white child that, uh, breaks into, broken into some houses, he's,  you know, done some stuff that's bad.  I'd have a problem with that, too.  But his name is, you know, Chip.  I'd have a problem with that.  What's that?  Yeah, would ya?  Yeah, you'd have a problem with that, I bet.  But what, would you have a bigger problem?  If she brings home a black athlete, that's a sport of menta, fuck yeah, that's cool. 
[02:02:00]  Really?  Yes.  Wow.  You would have to go to a white college, though, and just be one of the black athletes that  looks awkward walking on campus.  We, we, we do have a split on our roads of life, don't we?  We do.  That would be something that, uh, I, uh, you'd have a major problem with.  I don't have a, there's not any children.  You would really have a major problem with that?  If I had a daughter, and she brought home a black guy. 
[02:02:30]  What if the black guy was, like, like, not like, how would you, how do I, how do I explain  this to a racist?  I would have a problem with that.  And it's not being racist, it's just, I, I.  No, what if he's, uh, just a good guy?  Good job.  I don't know.  He comes from a good family.  I don't know.  He comes from a good town.  Like I said, I, I have no problem with, you know, I walk down the street every day in  New York City.  You can't, uh, not see interracial couples.  And it doesn't bother me at all. 
[02:03:00]  I'm like, whatever you want to do.  But I think in your own personal life, and this, I think, uh, goes for a lot of guys out  there with daughters, they, they would have a problem.  I think they would have a problem still.  It's not a problem down the street where you would, you know, in the old days, you'd take  a baseball bat to the guy or something.  That's not, you know.  It would, I, I'd have to go with the dumb answer.  It would, uh, depending on, depend on the individual.  Well, that isn't the dumb answer.  That's the answer that actually is logical and makes sense because you would want to  judge them on their character. 
[02:03:30]  I certainly, yeah.  But there's such a, there's still.  It would be strange.  Absolutely.  But I would, I would, I would definitely go with the individual.  There's still a stigma that, um, puts a kind of, uh, puts a bad light on a father.  If the daughter is dating a black guy, there, there's some, the, the instant thing you think  is, well, there's some kind of issue.  She's trying to get back at daddy. 
[02:04:00]  Like, that's the stereotype.  That's the, the thing that's out there.  But I don't know.  I, I, I would, uh, I, I, I would have a problem with it.  I, I don't know why.  I can't logically explain it.  But it's just one of these, at least you're being honest, ingrained things that from my  youth, maybe, I don't know.  All right.  I like pale white girls.  Ryan in Buffalo just quoted you.  I would have a problem if my daughter brought home a black guy, regardless of the guy, but  it's not racist, Anthony. 
[02:04:30]  No, it's not racist.  It's racial.  Racial.  It's, uh, it, it, in everything that involves race and every argument that involves race  doesn't necessarily make one party or the other racist.  That's the fucked society society we live in today.  We can't discuss race and disagree about race without one party being called a racist.  It's, but that's not true.  If, if she, if she brought home a flavor, flay type of character. 
[02:05:00]  Whoa.  Yes.  But then this guy, Pete from, ah, fuck.  I'll give Pete some time.  Pete, go ahead.  Anthony.  Yes, sir.  What would you do if she brought home like a super white black guy, like say a Wayne  Brady or to a lesser extent, a Bryant Gumbel?  Bryant Gumbel.  Now Bryant Gumbel works in my building.  No, cause it is a younger, a younger Bryant Gumbel.  You can barely tell he's black at this point, but it is a race thing.  It's weird.  It's a, it is a race thing.  And, but I'm not saying it's racist. 
[02:05:30]  Like there isn't this hatred of, oh my God, I'd, I'd, I'd kill her.  I'd do this.  It's not that it's just, it would make me very uncomfortable.  And, and I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be as, I would not be as happy as I would if it was  a white guy that came on.  And I think, I think a lot of, um, parents that have daughters that are with black guys  would probably, this is only my own opinion, would probably prefer that, um, she go out 
[02:06:00]  with a white guy.  I think a lot of people are just, we like animals.  We're just animals.  I think we, we kind of like our own type, our own people.  That's what we do.  Most of our friend groups are like us, right?  Aren't they?  They're not like a Sunny D commercial.  Our friend groups or, uh, you know, they were usually when, when I hang out with my friends,  it's a bunch of white guys.  I'm sure when black guys hang out with their friends, a bunch of black guys for the most 
[02:06:30]  part.  I'm not saying every example here.  Well, I'll tell you one of my fears.  Yeah.  Um, what if it's a gay situation?  Okay.  The gay.  Now, now you having a son, obviously that's, I would pressing, I would absolutely accept  that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But my fear is that then, that I would have to, again, the black guy, I would, I would  now have to like, fast forward a bunch of years.  Now I'm hanging out in gay places. 
[02:07:00]  You know what I mean?  That's why I have this fucking dream.  What would you have to do?  Like, I'm like, I know I would accept it.  I have no doubt about that.  I really would.  But then the part of it, the part about it that would be weird is, you know, now having  to hang out like in gay places.  Like why?  Because he, because he's having a party or something?  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever like your kid does as he's growing up.  Yeah.  All of a sudden you're at a gay pizza party.  I don't know.  Whatever.  You know what I mean? 
[02:07:30]  Right, right.  That's when I'd feel really fucking uncomfortable.  Now, what about like dinner at the family, right?  And there's a holiday dinner and, and him and the boy, and I'm not even thinking  saying name, I'm using generic, just him being, being whatever.  It's, it's the generic son of anybody we're talking about here.  Gotcha.  Uh, is sitting at the table and, and like rubbing the back.  And that would be very uncomfortable to watch.  I completely agree with you.  Yeah, I am.  But I would, you know, and you would sit there thinking, cause all your, all your dreams 
[02:08:00]  and wishes for your child are sometimes your own dreams and wishes or your dreams and  wishes for the best of them.  So I believe it would be like, okay, he plays sports.  He's got the pretty girlfriend.  The, the, the later on, there's the marriage, the kids, the whole thing, grandkids for you  and the way, like that whole thing.  And all that gets shot to shit cause he loves cock.  Right.  Like that to me would disappoint the parent, no matter how open-minded they are. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  When you, I just, you want a real answer or it should be a shock jock.  Yeah.  I just want happiness for my, my kids.  Well, of course.  I think everybody says that, but, but there is a certain.  No, cause I know, I wish I was happier growing up.  I really do.  So when you're a parent.  You wanted to be gay?  No.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe happy.  No.  No.  But I just want happiness for the kid.  Yeah.  Or the kids.  Yeah.  In the end.  In the end.  In the end.  Oh, oh, you meant, you meant finally, all right, okay, I get it. 
[02:09:00]  That's, that, when you, when you're a parent, that's, in the end, that's all you care about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you do.  Oh, do I, do I hope it's, it's, it's, it's a quote, normal existence.  Right.  You would prefer.  What I'm used to.  Yeah.  Of course.  Every parent would say the same fucking thing.  And that's all I'm really getting to.  Of course.  Is there's a preference.  But you would adjust.  As to what you would want your, your child to hook up with. 
[02:09:30]  And for a, a daughter that you, I think that a man has raised for years and years and then  comes home with, you know.  I'll tell you.  Laquan.  You'd, you might go like, oh, oh, okay.  You're not instantly going to be like, hey, great, pleasure to meet you.  You're going to be like, what are my friends going to think?  It's going to be, and it's going to be very selfish, all that, I think.  And I'll agree with that.  But, but it's just one of those things. 
[02:10:00]  The, uh, and now I go back to your original question.  Yeah.  The sex change thing, I would be out of my mind about.  Oh, well, that, that, that, that would, that would be a little much.  Wow.  That.  Wow.  That's when I'm completely, I would, I'd be accepting, but wow.  Unless the kid's like cute and could pull it off.  If he could pull it off, certainly.  Because you don't want an ugly tranny.  But I got, I got a, I got a prominent Adam's apple.  Adam's apple.  So if he has that.  Game over right there.  Game over.  How are you going to shave that shit down? 
[02:10:30]  You got to look.  Mine's pointy.  The guy's got to have no Adam's apple.  You know how many scabs I've gotten right there at that exact point?  Oh, from shaving?  Yeah.  Right at the point.  Ow.  I have to pull.  I've hurt.  You know what I do?  Because it's so prominent.  I'd have to pull my skin to the side.  The side.  Just throw it to the side.  To the side.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then I push it all the way to the left and shave it.  That's, that's it.  Best not fuck with that.  Because I was sick of having a scab in the middle of my neck every, every three days.  All right.  Sex change.  Where were we?  So Chaz thing? 
[02:11:00]  So you're not surprised that Cher's not more open about this?  Cher's a freak though, man.  No, no.  I'm not that surprised, to tell you the truth.  I could see that.  I mean, you're not surprised.  Yeah, I could see her because it's her kid.  And that's what the point we were getting at.  How can Ant not be racist when he said.  Sorry, I was just reading some of that.  Oh, you want this one?  Yeah, because a couple of people are getting on this.  Only a story.  Jay in Georgia.  Jay.  Hi, Jay.  Hey, Jay.  Hey, man.  Coming from a black guy.  Yeah.  He has dated outside his race. 
[02:11:30]  Uh-huh.  How can you say that statement and actually not think it's not racist?  Well, that's just it.  It's, it's not racist.  Everything doesn't have to be racist.  It's an opinion that I have that I think a lot of other people have.  And I did call it selfish.  It's a selfish thing.  If the daughter, if the white daughter is happy with a black guy and brings that black gentleman home, I think any white father is going to have preferred she bring home a white guy. 
[02:12:00]  Uh, and, and I think that isn't racist.  I think that's just human.  No, see, I do agree.  I'm glad that you did admit that it is selfish and you're thinking about your own manners instead of what your offspring is thinking.  Right.  But, but for you to say, no matter what, the guy could be a stockbroker.  Yeah.  And for you to see this guy to walk in and the first thing that you think of is, oh, wow, my daughter just brought home a nigger. 
[02:12:30]  It's color.  It would, but no, you don't necessarily have to say nigger.  I'm just saying, I'm saying.  No, that's fucked up.  It is fucked up.  That's a fucked up way of thinking.  But, but isn't that what we do?  What if, what if she brought home, uh, uh, the, the fucking, uh, Rocky Dennis from mask and she brings him home and the door opens up and you go there, there's a white kid, but Jesus Christ, he looks like a freak.  Uh, you would prefer that she would have brought home a normal looking guy. 
[02:13:00]  I think, I think she brings home Rocky Dennis, hopefully the little guy, yeah, she's blind and touches his face and goes, Holy shit.  I think if you have a daughter, whatever she brings home, you're not gonna be happy with.  Yeah.  You would hope that she just, you know, and it's not fair.  Hold on, sir.  And it's, it's not fair.  Cause ants, ants speaking the truth and this is how he feels.  And that's how a lot of people feel.  I bet you it's the same with black fathers.  If, if they bring home a white girl or a white guy, if they were in the house, Opie, the father, if you can find the father first, he would be very upset. 
[02:13:30]  He would be very upset as well.  If you brought home some fucking, uh, wonder bread, uh, chick or wonder bread dude.  Yeah.  I am on the phone.  I can't hear y'all.  Um, you know what though?  There are a lot of, Hey, what about all these black chicks that, uh, get all pissy about the white, uh, black guys going out with white chicks saying, you know, we can't find a good black man because they're dating white broads. 
[02:14:00]  Well, honestly, I, I, I've been, I've, I've just got back onto the dating scene.  I've noticed more and more black women going out with white chicks.  How long are you in for?  Oh, hey, hey, you know something?  I'm fucking with you.  I know.  But honestly, I'm, I'm one of the, I listen to you go off on your rants and I'm just, I feel the same way about, about a lot of it too.  I'm looking at these niggas like, what the fuck are y'all doing?  I'm not helping us out.  Why don't y'all stop?  I've never been in, never been in, but I have a good job and I got credit too. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, damn.  Damn.  Yeah.  So I'm going to call Gisbert records.  I'm going to get you a Louis Vuitton.  Right.  Shit.  Oh, remember that?  No, I'm just saying, dude, it's one of those things where it doesn't have to.  And that's one thing I've, I've tried to stress on this show.  I go off and say a lot of shit.  I know I do.  But, uh, but everything that involves race and a disagreement does not necessarily mean  one party or the other is racist. 
[02:15:00]  And, and that word gets handed out so much that it's frustrating when you're really trying  to be racist.  Everyone says, everyone says a statement and stuff and it's a moment type of thing.  So I can understand where you're coming from with the statement, but you just have to  like, I, I realized I said some shit too.  Yeah, we all do.  Like, why the fuck did I just say that?  You sound really black.  Do you feel guilty after you say dumb shit? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, yeah, I do.  I'm like, how are you motherfuckers?  You know something?  Why?  I never do.  I have no guilt.  It's terrible.  Right.  As long as the windows are up and you're escalating and you're speeding down to LIE.  Yeah, yeah, I hear you.  All right.  All right, man.  Hey, thanks for calling on.  All right.  Cool.  You don't mean that.  You don't want to thank him for calling.  No, I do.  I like having an open dialogue with African-Americans on the phone.  You like the brothers.  With the safety of the phone line. 
[02:16:00]  No, it's, it's good.  You know why you get, you get the other side of the story and they get to hear my side  of it without just it being a rant on the air that comes off as very racist.  Um, and I'll, I'll say it a thousand times.  It's, uh, it's not necessarily racist all the time.  It doesn't have to be.  No, we can do.  I want to do a few most annoying 30 seconds.  Most annoying 30 seconds.  That's our big cost contest.  Costume.  That's our big contest. 
[02:16:30]  Uh, Steven Singer's putting up 2000 bucks.  First prize for this.  Where does Lady Gaga fit here?  Lady Gaga.  Well, that's annoying.  Probably goes over 30 seconds.  Well, she's saying she's a loser.  What is she copying Beck now?  I'm a loser.  Say, because she copied Madonna.  Wow.  That's so cute.  We're going in.  What do you think of this Lady Gaga?  Um, I, uh, I like her.  I gotta be honest with you. 
[02:17:00]  I think she's talented.  I think she knows how to make a pop hit.  Her song's very poppy, very catchy.  Uh, I think she's a blithering idiot.  I don't think.  When she tries to speak politically on a stage, it's hysterical.  And she's trying to speak for all her followers that she calls monsters or something.  Oh.  But she's not intelligent enough to really represent those people whatsoever.  No.  And she doesn't need all that nonsense either.  Nonsense.  Madonna didn't really have, she didn't really have nonsense like Lady Gaga. 
[02:17:30]  She would do some things.  She would be outrageous and, and she'd change up her, her act every few years.  But she didn't, but she didn't put a building on her head and walk out her front door.  No, or show up in a pod or wear a meat suit.  Like, she doesn't need that nonsense.  No.  She's, she's good without all that shit.  Yeah.  You don't need, you don't need props if you have talent.  Oh, boy.  Sorry, Carrot Top.  Oh, poor Carrot Top.  And we're friends with him and I just did that, damn it.  Just pulls him in.  Fucking props.  Amazing.  Makes thousands of, hundreds of thousands, millions. 
[02:18:00]  He's a multi-millionaire.  Jesus.  What do I know?  With tattooed on eyebrows and giant muscles.  That are implants.  With his frozen face.  But we're friends with him.  Yeah, yeah.  But we love him.  But we love him.  We learned that from our comic friends.  But we love him.  He's great.  He's honest about things.  Tattooed eyebrows, huh?  That's what I'm reading.  Oh, my.  I saw it.  Captain Carl.  I saw it. 
[02:18:30]  He plucked all his eyebrows out.  He plucked them out.  And then he took a tattoo thing and he just went.  Mum, mum, mum, mum, mum.  That's right.  This is what Gaga is saying today.  And then I think about how I don't really give a shit if people don't understand what I do.  As long as my fans under.  She's a whiny.  If you sing so powerfully, how do you sound like that? 
[02:19:00]  I just don't want my fans to ever feel...  I just sometimes feel like a loser still.  You're a phony.  You know what, though?  She came out of Dayton, Ohio with two bad knees.  And you really got to give it to her because...  15 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees.  Yeah.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player. 
[02:19:30]  Well, what happened?  I hope it came true.  That's what I want to know.  Did it come true?  What happened?  I think God, the dream came true.  Damn, burger!  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, God, I love that clip.  See, Lady Gaga has a certain part of her fan base that...  A je ne sais quoi.  ...that feel like they're losers.  Right.  So what Lady Gaga is doing is relating by saying sometimes I feel like a loser. 
[02:20:00]  Does she cut?  Is she a cutter?  I hope Lady Gaga is a cutter.  I guarantee she's well-adjusted.  And the people you talk about that kind of know her from her village days...  Yeah.  This is not Stephanie.  It's an act.  This isn't Stephanie.  Her real name is Stephanie, and this is like...  Stephanie.  And this is just a character that she fucking was smart enough to develop and is going all in with.  Stephanie Gaga?  I think Stephanie was very confident of her musical abilities. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  And then she also was smart enough to go, wait a minute, what can I tap into?  There's a lot of fucking losers out there in school that have no one representing them.  I'm going to be that person.  Isn't that what cult leaders do?  Yes.  They find these vulnerable people...  Weak people.  ...and then capitalize on their weaknesses and vulnerabilities so that they rally around them and feel empowered.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Let's just...  So Lady Gaga is pretty much a cult leader. 
[02:21:00]  You know how many girls on their Facebook today is like, she's talking for all of us.  She's talking to me.  Because I also feel like a loser.  She's talking to me.  Um, hi, Lady Gaga.  Yeah, uh...  You know, I just want to move on with my life.  I've had enough of you.  Enough of your music.  I don't even like it anymore.  I haven't listened in forever.  Just, uh, had enough of you, Lady Gaga.  And, um, I won't ever call you again unless I call you in ten minutes. 
[02:21:30]  I mean...  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  So, uh, Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga.  Let me, let me...  Let me go back a little bit.  Yeah, let's hear her tear up a little again.  Well, because she's just like her fans.  What happened?  Molly Ringwald looks like shit. 
[02:22:00]  What happened to Molly Ringwald?  Wait a minute.  Sorry.  Molly Ringwald getting the pretty back.  No, she's not.  She's an author now.  Yeah.  She's got retard bangs.  Retard bangs.  And a big, like, jaw.  Yeah, something happened.  Her jaw kind of.  Oh, she'll be here in a couple hours?  Yeah.  Well, I'll fucking tell her to her face.  Bring her right to me.  She ain't coming in this fucking show.  Is she all fat?  Looks like it.  Yeah, it looks like she goes.  Oh, God.  How many kids did she squirt out? 
[02:22:30]  It looks like tree.  Oh, yeah.  Teen fakes pregnancy.  What the hell's going on?  Yeah, it's some kind of a project that she did where this kid told her, I guess, her boyfriend  and her mother and no one else that she was pregnant.  And, you know, she'd wear padding and put a little more in every day and see what the  stigma was and how people reacted to her being pregnant and in school.  Do you think that show, 16 and Pregnant, is getting a lot of girls to get pregnant so  they could be on the show? 
[02:23:00]  So they could be cast for the show?  I don't know about a lot, but I'm sure there are probably a few that think that that's a  way to get on TV.  I bet you there's a few that got pregnant just hoping that they would get the call for the  show.  Yeah.  I think so.  Back to Lady Gaga?  Yeah, back to some Gaga.  She's got to tell her fans she also feels like a loser so everyone can relate to each  other.  I just sometimes feel like a loser. 
[02:23:30]  It's crazy because it's like we're at the garden, but I still sometimes feel like a loser  kid in school.  And I just got to pick my shit.  Shut the fuck up.  You're at the garden and you feel like a loser?  Is that it?  Stop whining.  Get her in here.  Stop it.  Stop whining.  We're going to have a conversation, Lady Gaga.  You're bullshitting your fucking fan base.  Shut up.  I just whining.  It's crazy because I'm at the garden. 
[02:24:00]  I'm at the garden.  The Olive Garden.  I should be whining.  I'm crying over here.  I'm sorry.  Who's killing?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I was over by the photogs.  Did he say photogs?  Yeah, that's the part that I remember the most about his lame ass fucking call.  He said photogs?  I was down by the photogs.  The photogs.  And you were crying by the photogs because the Who was playing your favorite little Who song? 
[02:24:30]  I just can't help it.  God, that goes back quite a way.  Yeah, we've got to play it again.  Bruce Kelly, everyone.  Bruce Kelly.  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under the photogs.  You know, the amazing watching Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrow perform these songs after all these years  and still have the full spirit of what they do under control.  I mean, you know, Townsend just continues to be an amazing guitar player.  I'm sorry. 
[02:25:00]  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me with that video.  Yeah, the video was very powerful.  Yeah, yeah, that was, uh, that's, uh, this is very awkward.  I'm sorry, but, uh, it was just very, I mean, you know, it's just a Who.  Dayton, Ohio, too bad news.  You're a kid out there with the Who.  Dream.  That's it.  I'm sorry.  You were seeing them live.  I guess that was in color?  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, they were live on stage, but the black and white was happening on the big screens, too, so.  But who are you?  Well, who?  So there's two more to go here at Hyde Park.  I feel like an idiot.  I'm sorry, really.  No, no, you are.  It's overwhelming.  That's what this, you know, that really is what this is all about.  There are certain moments that touch everybody.  Yeah.  You know.  Oh, God.  And I said last time we played the clip, at that point in George Till and Morris' career,  he already knew he had, like, cancer.  Yeah.  And he wasn't crying.  Cancer.  And the damn cancer took that guy out. 
[02:26:00]  He's no longer with us.  Yeah, he's a dead man.  He held it together knowing shit was growing inside him.  Yeah.  And this fucking guy doesn't.  He's crying under the photogs.  I just, I, I, I just, I, I, I.  Because he, he saw, won't get fooled again live.  He's crying.  Yeah.  Fuck, I like the who, but I'll never cry over him.  Then he got the word, cancer.  Yeah.  Well, Lady Gaga.  Well, Lady Gaga.  I still sometimes feel like a loser kid in high school.  and I just got to pick my shit up. 
[02:26:30]  I got to pick myself up  and I have to tell myself  I'm a superstar every morning.  What a dog.  You know what?  That's how I get out of bed.  It's the only way I can get out of bed  is tell myself I'm a superstar  and the call I get from Kenny.  Well, instead of saying super,  we have to say radio.  Boy, that's a big drop off.  It's a big drop off from super.  This superstar and then way below that  this radio star. 
[02:27:00]  She has to tell herself  she's a superstar every morning.  What a self-important asshole.  What she's doing is  she's setting up her career  for when that song comes out  that's...  Not quite the...  But then this type of shit  keeps the career going  because then they rally behind her.  I know this isn't as good  as the other stuff, Lady Gaga,  but we're still behind you.  We're with you  because we know you're a loser like us 
[02:27:30]  and have to wake up  and say you're a superstar every morning.  You know that Ellen tweeted yesterday.  Degenerous?  Yeah, I follow a lot of weird people  on Twitter.  Yes, I do.  Because people fucking call me out  on it all the time.  Yes, I do.  I follow strange fucking people.  Yes, you're right.  Well, it's an eclectic mix.  Ellen tweeted that her good friend Lady Gaga...  Good friend.  ...has decided to perform Judas  for the first time on her show.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:28:00]  And I wanted to tweet Ellen and go,  well, are you going to ask her  about the Muslim thing  that we talked about?  Yeah, what about that?  Ask her why she doesn't, you know,  do songs about Muhammad.  Because they'll chop her head off.  You know, I wake up every morning  when I'm scared I'll get my hand chopped off.  Yeah, I would too.  I'm a superstar every morning.  Oh, I gotta hear that.  Superstar!  This is taking a lot longer than I thought.  I thought this was a throwaway,  but this is pretty deep shit.  I pick myself up. 
[02:28:30]  And I have to tell myself  I'm a superstar every morning  so that I can get through this day  and be for my fans  what they need for me to be.  But sometimes I still feel like  people are trying to destroy me.  What are you going to teach them tonight?  That I cannot be destroyed.  I cannot be destroyed.  This is complete...  Wow.  Who's interviewing her?  She's adamantium.  Who's HBO special? 
[02:29:00]  They can't get a good interviewer  that goes, look, Lady Gaga,  you're full of shit.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  Why can't they say that  back to these people?  I'd be like,  are you having a nervous breakdown right now?  Should I call a doctor?  You're full of shit, Lady Gaga.  Yeah.  I gotta be there for my fans.  I cannot be destroyed.  What is she now?  Optimus Prime.  That's funny.  That is really funny.  Optimus Gaga.  She cannot be destroyed. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, God.  I don't know if this...  Nathan Brimmer on Twitter...  I'm just going to say this,  and whatever.  Andrew Dice Gaga.  I wish.  I'm just throwing it out there.  For down the road, maybe.  Yeah, I don't know enough...  Not everything has to happen right now.  I don't know enough Gaga shit.  Oh, we could write.  Yeah.  Well...  As soon as I hear Dice,  we'll start writing on me.  The Gaga.  We'll start writing, motherfucker.  Gaga talks about fighting for her fans  and her authenticity. 
[02:30:00]  Her authenticity?  Yep.  I'm just...  I'm like...  I just feel like I have to fight.  I'm fighting for every kid that's like me  that felt like I felt.  It feels like I still feel.  It hurts when I know...  P?  How much...  Oh.  Authenticity...  It was chlamydia.  And how much genuine blood is in my spirit.  And how much I feel like people don't know that. 
[02:30:30]  You know?  Because they...  Well, it's tough to know that  when you walk around with meat.  Yeah, yeah.  As clothing.  No one's really getting to know  the real Stephanie.  You dope.  When you're Lady Gaga  walking around wearing meat  and coming out of a pod  and having animals on your head.  When you walk around  like a good humor ice cream truck,  it's really tough to listen to the words.  Yeah.  And know that you have this,  you know,  life's blood in you  that you... 
[02:31:00]  Bloody, bloody, bloody, blah.  You want to be taken seriously.  Get a nice, sexy fucking dress.  Go out there and sing your tunes.  There you go.  That's how easy that is.  Keep it simple.  Because they see wigs and lipstick  and they just shut down  because they don't understand.  I'm sorry.  Don't be sorry.  I just want to be a queen for them.  You know what?  Some people feel like one. 
[02:31:30]  She wants to be a queen for them.  JamesQ78 on Twitter.  Lady Gaga is lying  like a used car salesman.  I think she's lying too, brother.  I really do.  Nice 50s reference.  Like a used car salesman.  Big Billy B money, right?  So Lady Gaga wakes up  every morning in her bed  at the Ritz or Four Seasons  or on her star coach  with her security and assistance.  Yeah.  I'm a superstar 
[02:32:00]  and doggone it,  people like me.  Yeah, she has to wake up  and just tell herself  she's a superstar every morning  or else she doesn't think  she can be for her fans  what she has to be  which is a queen  that cannot be destroyed  and she wants everyone to know  she cannot be destroyed.  Right, she's the queen  of the losers.  That's pretty much  the summation  of the horse shit  that just babbled  out of her fucking mouth.  We got one more clip  if you want to.  Oh, thank God.  I do, yes.  Yeah?  Wish there was more.  All right. 
[02:32:30]  Anyone else hearing  Courtney Love?  Oh, really?  Like she's doing  a Courtney Love?  Yeah, that whiny whiny thing.  I'm not saying she's  like Courtney Love.  Just sounds.  Yeah, yeah.  There's that sound.  That delivery.  Wow.  I just,  it's not about being  a winner for me anymore.  Really?  You know,  it's about being  a winner for all of them.  I'd be pissed off  if I was a loser.  A fan?  Yeah, I'd be fucking pissed off. 
[02:33:00]  Like, look,  I just like your music.  Don't fucking put me  in this category  that I need you  to be a martyr  crying for me.  I don't need you.  I could be a loser  on my own.  You don't worry.  Don't worry.  I'm all right.  Yeah, I'm fine.  Now give me another pop hit  so I can fucking,  you know,  drive to the mall  with my friends.  You don't have to cry  wondering if you could be  the person  I think you  should be for me.  No.  Just put a poppy tune out.  I'll be like,  hey, that's pretty cool. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, that's catchy.  That's a catchy one.  I hate these  one-sided interviews  where she thinks she's  Why isn't the interviewer  challenging her on this?  Instead, Lady Gaga  actually goes,  I'm sorry for crying.  And then the interviewer  goes, that's okay.  I would be in her face  like, what?  This is fucking fake.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you,  are you serious with this?  I'd be like,  are you serious?  Yes, let's go back  to the village  when you were Stephanie.  Do you read so much email,  fan email and tweets  every day  that you think  everyone that listens  to you thinks like that 
[02:34:00]  and needs it?  Because I'm sure  all she reads is like,  Lady Gaga,  you are the best.  I was going to kill myself  and then I heard your music  and then she's thinking,  oh wow,  I'm playing God here.  Right.  I put out music  and I change lives.  Well, you know what,  Lady Gaga?  We make jokes  and change lives.  lives,  but I don't go home  weeping that I'm not  going to be enough  for my fans.  They don't deserve  is what I give them now.  Damn.  I'm a fucking idiot. 
[02:34:30]  I'm an idiot.  I'm just,  you know,  Opie,  I'm really choked up  at the fact that I'm,  I feel I'm not fat enough  for our fans.  I'm a bitch.  I'm a bitch.  I'm a bitch.  Yeah.

[02:54:30]  a crew  never had a posse  i'm always playing  the clubs  when the chelsea  hamlers are  playing the arenas  right  my humility's  always been in  check  polarizer show  got canceled  due to half  slices  i know  half slices  due to us  not really  pushing his  show forward  for him  we tried  you missed  a weird day  i heard  you missed  a really weird  day with  polarizer  yeah  that weird  i listened  to i was  driving down  to atlantic  city  yeah  and i listened  to the entire  interview  it was completely  fucking normal 
[02:55:00]  and fun  and ronnie b  did a mind  fuck on us  like we totally  insulted paul rye  that's what  ronnie b does  and then when i  listened to it  on the replay  i mean yeah  it was uncomfortable  like an idiot  but you could not  hear me laughing  on the mic  and then  he was the one  yelling  take him to the  zoo rock  right  but we were going  like tell us  about the show  and then paul rye  there was really  funny  i really  surprised  i would cringe  i had it out  in the car  and i tried to  get it up  before my wife  heard it  right 
[02:55:30]  because i had  to go  what's wrong  with you  why would you  act that way  yeah  and uh  it was totally  i thought it was  totally fine  the guy came in  and said i don't  really want to ask  i didn't want to  write anything  and i really  didn't want to be  on television  and we all looked  at each other  like well then  what the fuck  yeah he didn't  wow  and he didn't  sell his own show  he knew  i want to listen  to that audio  again  he knew it  just  he knew this  show sucked  so bad  so he was  trying to like  spin it in such  a way like  look i didn't  even want to  do anything  i was happy  just fucking  doing nothing  canceled after two  shows by the way 
[02:56:00]  yeah i know  they said  worst ratings  almost ever  in the history  yeah  anthony at one  time he said  i want to get  this correct  he said  i gotta look  in the mirror  every morning  and tell myself  i'm a superstar  oh my god  you know  he said  i've done  15 interviews  in two days  i've yet to  make this show  sound funny  he did say  something like that  holy shit  thank god  we didn't see  the show  he knew  it's  it's  curb your  enthusiasm  with me  that's all  he had to  say  right 
[02:56:30]  yeah  that's  that's  pretty much  what i saw  but then we're  trying to help  him out  i'm like  is it like  the comeback  because a lot  of people  really like  that show  he's like  no it's not  like that  at all  i'm like  okay so  it's not  like a show  that people  really like  enjoyed  but then  ronnie b  made it  on call  the boy  going  paula  the comeback  opi  don't bring  up the  lisa kudrow  thing  ronnie b  was  motherfuckering  the whole  time  ronnie b  is  and  unfortunately  most of  his listeners  do not  know this  he is  way worse  than me  and you  when it  comes to  that shit  oh i love 
[02:57:00]  him  he's a  shitster  there's no  one better  he said  he's uncomfortable  he goes  i'm uncomfortable  with your  awkwardness  you and opi  like it  i go  your whole  fucking  show  is awkward  right  right  there's a  weeping  fucking  mess  across the  console  what are  he talking  about  jay  jay then i  thought about  you the  other day  i went and  did another  run on  ron and  fez and  i made  fez cry  and then  ronnie blames  me like  that was  my purpose  and fez  he believed  them  well you  come out  here to  make me  cry 
[02:57:30]  i made  him cry  last year  by inviting  him to  foxwood  yeah  that's why  i bring  you up  today  it reminded  me of  that because  it was  not my  intentions  i was  asking  he i  finally figured  out that  fez likes  batman  yeah  this was the  dumb bit  i'm like  fez what  character would  be in batman  and he felt  the pressure  i don't know  maybe he  didn't know  how to  answer that  and he  broke down  yeah  and then he  goes well  you accomplished  your goal  i'm like  i wasn't  trying to  make you  cry  i made him  cry once  we were  having a  discussion  about something  i was 
[02:58:00]  calling in  right  we had a  discussion  and he  started crying  i'm like  i wasn't  i didn't  mean to  i  my  my whole  i felt  bad  my whole  thought on  the thing  was that  ronnie  came in  and did  our show  i did a  little  ronnie  on his  show  so i'm  thinking  through this  whole process  when you  were gone  and we  were mixing  up all  sorts of  shit  i'm thinking  i think  fezzy might  feel a little  left out  now i'm  openly telling  you what  i was thinking  in my head  okay i didn't  say this to  anyone until  right now  so i'm  thinking i'm  gonna try to  relate to  fez a little  bit and  bring him  into the 
[02:58:30]  you know  into the  group  and he  saw that  as me  trying to  make him  fucking  cry  but don't  you wonder  how much  of that  is a bit  because on  radio like  everything's  a bit  in my  mind  i don't  know  it's not  a bit  no  you guys  and then  fucking  and then  going back  going back  to the  ronnie b  thing jay  so i i  go for the  over the top  apology when  the mics  were off  i didn't  tell anyone  this  i'm like  fez i swear  to you  i didn't  come in  here to  try to  make you  cry  i go  can i 
[02:59:00]  do that  to a  person  yeah i  know i  can but  that wasn't  my intentions  whatsoever  and you  got to  believe me  i was like  man to  man you  know  okay  okay  okay  and then  he goes  well  and then  he felt  uncomfortable  he's like  i gotta  go to  the bathroom  right  now i'm  feeling good  about myself  because i'm  like okay  fez believes  i didn't  do that  on purpose  door shuts  ronnie  goes  ah he  don't  believe  you  because he  don't  believe  you  like that  motherfucker  like not  even missing  a fucking  beat  ah he  don't  believe  you  i thought  the ricky 
[02:59:30]  gervais  interview  was way  more  uncomfortable  than the  Paul  Rizer  interview  because  when ricky  gervais  came in  he came  in with  louis  ck  and louis  ck  and ricky  gervais  set themselves  up in the  corner  like fucking  besties  like fucking  girls at a  lunchroom  and every  fucking  joke that  jimmy  ronnie  me or opie  said  they completely  fucking  ignored  and then  louis  would go  you're a  fat fuck  and ricky  gervais  would go  oh  I mean 
[03:00:00]  if you  did that  interview  jimmy  jimmy  has reduced  himself  playing  the guy  that just  states  pragmatic  facts  like they're  talking about  almost dying  on a private  plane  like  it was  fucking  that to me  was uncomfortable  though  the fucking  ball washing  of fucking  louis  and ricky  wow  they were  everyone  and everyone  was licking  fucking  jerry  seinfeld's  balls  and i'm  like  am i  really in  a room  with people  that are  just 
[03:00:30]  going  on and  on  about  what  an  incredible  comic  jerry  seinfeld  is  yeah  and louis  he's amazing  he's a maestro  it's like  watching  the world's  who's the  greatest violin  guy that  everybody  references  yo-yo  ma  no you  know  the old  time  guy  he's like  watching  stradavarius  it's like  stradavari  like watching  a composer  like one  of the  world's  bro  tchaikovsky  and i'm  like  he does  the same  fucking  50 minutes  and he  gives it  all to  it  louis  said  and he 
[03:01:00]  gives it  all to  his audience  every night  i never  saw anything  like that  in my  life  and i'm  like  are we  thinking  of the  same  guy  that  does  this  yeah  they uh  they were  definitely  two little  school girls  in the  lunchroom  were they  really  not including  anyone else  and then  like louis  wanted  uh ricky's  opinion on  something he  shot  to see if  ricky thought  it was funny  yeah  i'm thinking  to myself  there's a lot  of other  funny guys  in this room  that maybe  want to take  a look at  that too  oh really  so jay's  onto something 
[03:01:30]  it was that  they had their  own little  thing going  i tapped  out when louis  said do you  ever let  anybody else  fucking talk  i went  all right  oh yeah  he got mad  at jay  oh shit  i forgot about  that  i don't know  if it was  real mad  i mean  that's the  one thing  i always  wished i  could change  i know  i fucking  constantly  working on  oh man  he said  that  obviously  you're not  working on  that right  now though  oh now  i didn't say  a word when  you were telling  your whole  make fez  cry story  i think i  kept the  interest in

[03:04:30]  oh shit  wow man  fucking  louis and i  were on an  airplane  a private jet  right  and we're  flying into  lowell massachusetts  and louis going  fuck  nigger baby  fuck them in  their ass  right  because he's  afraid to die  on the airplane  he's gonna  fuck nigger baby  that helps me get out of my  that helps me get out of my  fucking  my comfort zone  fuck you you  british  fucking shit  fucker  fucker 
[03:05:00]  jerry's the best i've ever seen  jerry's incredible  jerry  louis said  i opened for jerry  i opened for jerry  and i couldn't believe  watching in the wings  watching  what a virtuoso  he was on stage  and i wanted to go  virtuoso at what  like what the fuck  are you talking about  you're in the room  with some fucking  grand slam hitters  man  like it's me  louis  and jim  and ricky gervais  and he's talking about 
[03:05:30]  how fucking  seinfeld's a virtuoso  like really  let's see him get  heckled  holy  shit  the fucking  ball washing  that went on  yeah  god damn it  i ricky gervais  i am sorry  i missed that one man  that that's a good bit  that sounded  he was good  but it was  they literally  set up where  eroc sits  and ricky took out  his computer  and started writing  because god forbid  he takes ten minutes  off  he was writing  fucking stuff 
[03:06:00]  on his computer  during the entire  interview  he's that fucking  he's that fucking  he's that fucking  in control of  everything  that's like  i i got  i have to write  during an interview  i'm fucking  the guy  he's prolific  that's why  and then  fucking  ricky gervais  loved the room  loved the energy  but every time  louis spoke  he goes  and then jimmy  was saying  the funniest  shit  jimmy was doing  the guy 
[03:06:30]  that just like  the neighbor  that states  the obvious  they're like  we're on a private jet  and it's about  the fucking crash  is bouncing  all over the skies  and jimmy goes  oh that makes me  nauseous when that  happens  sometimes i have  to take drama  mean  nothing  and they're just  fucking  they were just  freezing us out  like fucking  isaiah and magic  at the all-star game  freezing out jordan  wow  just passing each other  uh now we need a clip  of that interview  yeah yeah  i'd love to hear  some of that  the line i had 
[03:07:00]  that didn't land  was uh  louis  ricky was picking  louis up  in a private jet  and louis was  fucking late  right  i forgot my keys  i forgot  were you a fucking  english fucking retard  i was late  because my fucking  he goes  yeah we went to  lowell mass  i can't do louis good  so i'll just talk  and louis said  i had mickey ward  train me  uh  you know mickey ward  the fighter from  lowell mass  remember he came  on the private plane  with us  because he trained  me for my upcoming  uh  my stand-up special 
[03:07:30]  and i thought  who the fuck  is sitting across  from me  this is  that's something  louis would mock  if anyone else  said  wait you had a  fucking boxing  trainer  train you to  tell fucking jokes  oh shit  i mean let's  fucking call a  spade a spade  here anthony  yeah  and fucking  i sat there  and said  well i had an  angel special  coming up  so i'd mickey ward  i had a boxing  guy  training me  to get me  in shape  for my special  he'd go  what are you  a fucking  retard  that's a fucking 
[03:08:00]  fact  and you know  it  we become  what we hate  wow  man  and then i said  uh  then he goes  and the reason  i was late  we had to get  there  we were in  lowell mass  we had a plane  and we had to  pick up mickey ward  cause he was  training me  for my hbo  special  to get me  in shape  for my special  and uh  and in my mind  i'm going  are you fucking  boxing in your  special  what the fuck  are you talking  about  and then  and then he goes  on and on  and louie goes  yeah  and the reason  i was late  is cause my fucking  dog got hit by a car  and that's why i was late 
[03:08:30]  so i hope you're happy  and then i said  quietly  driven by mickey ward  like no  no one even  fucking  picked their heads  up  nothing  it was  a fucking  ice festival  it was  the seniors  and the freshmen  were sitting  at their fucking table  look at the game  tape  if you don't believe me  wow  i didn't know  you had such a problem  with louis ck  i don't have problems  oh he doesn't have problems  no problems  right  no no problem  he's a great guy 
[03:09:00]  i love him  no problem  when me and voss  at the studio  opi goes  so you guys  are you problems  like we don't have  there's no problem  no problems  no problems  just some observations  saying that he had  hired a boxing trainer  for his hbo special  i thought  if you told him  four years ago  that he's going to be  in a studio  and a comic's going to say that  he would have eviscerated  said comic  and then you would have went  no it's going to be you  yeah yeah  yeah  don't tell me  I'm wrong on that  opi 
[03:09:30]  no i think  i think jay's right  on that one  it's a great observation  but people do  well you know  change i guess  i don't know  opi you're telling me  during that interview  you didn't feel like  i said it was a good observation  those two were definitely  on the same page  i know but good observations  like on the fence  like so you can jump over  to louie  like if louie goes  look let me tell you  when louie tells his side  i'll go wow  that's a good observation  great observation  now jay's calling me out  it got a little  okay you know what 
[03:10:00]  i'll put on it  anthony  the fucking tape  speaks for itself  yeah  fifteen minutes into the interview  i look over  opi's playing space invaders  i think it was angry birds  but  fuck you opi  and fuck michael jackson  wow  that's harsh  god damn jay  people are loving this  shit  loving the ricky gervais  it's so god damn funny  they're loving it  it's uh  and the whole show  is ricky gervais  chris rock  louie ck  and  uh  jerry seinfeld  talking about comedy 
[03:10:30]  and they were just  fucking  ball washing  jerry  and then in turn  ball washing  lou  did you feel  uh  opi  did you feel  during that interview  like a freshman  sitting with seniors  at lunch  oh absolutely  oh really  it was that vibe  yeah yeah  wow  it was a very  fucking rarefied  like  this is  we're different  you  oof  that's a little  uncomfortable  hmm  it was pretty weird  and 
[03:11:00]  and  and  was there  was there any sign  that jay  that you felt like  you were the problem  no i didn't  louie yelled at him  that's what i mean  no that was before  it happened  that was before the interview  he yelled at me  uh  before ricky came in  but if you listen to the interview  you'll be amazed  at how little i talk  really  yeah they shut him down  i had two things  that didn't land  and i went  i went wow  this is fucking different  alright  then that's it  just fucking back out  yeah jay shut down  wow 
[03:11:30]  and it  and that's saying a lot  if i was actually  now i want  now i want to hear this  yeah  yeah well  i'm gonna have to give a list  we might have to pull clips now  ron bennington shut down  yeah ronnie  wow  ronnie b  me opie and ronnie  and then jimmy's going like  yeah  oh and the best is when  ricky gervais  said i loved his face  about jimmy  and thought he was bobby kelly  yeah  what  yeah i made jimmy sad  he goes i remember you were at the comedy cellar  and you were on stage  and louie said something to me 
[03:12:00]  to make me laugh  and i wasn't laughing at you  and i laughed really loud  and you thought i was laughing at you  and i wasn't laughing at you  but it was so embarrassing  and he goes  please don't tell me  you're mistaking me  for that blob of shit  yeah jimmy did say that  blob of shit  i think jimmy pretty much said it that way  yeah  and he was  he thought he was bobby kelly  yeah  that made jimmy sad  wow man  jimmy never got over that  for the rest of the interview  oh i don't doubt it  no no jimmy will latch on to something 
[03:12:30]  because then ricky half-hardly said  no no i do know who you are  oh  you know one of those  oh  so  all right jay moars  wow man  what do you come up  ronnie b  ronnie b and louie said  you always live in the moment  you're like a fucking dog  you're like a  a fucking dog  like you just lick your own balls  and  just  just live in the moment  you have this crazy ability  you're just the most  you're just this fucking annoying stupid fuck  you just live in the moment  like moment 
[03:13:00]  it's like a little kid  ronnie b  said  that lets go of the fucking handlebars  and he doesn't give a fuck what happens  like  like that moment of floating in the air  that's you  you live in the moment  fucking fast forward 20 minutes  they're talking about carl  from ricky gervais' show  and they go  it's really amazing  he lives only in the moment  he's a buddha  he's really like a buddha  and that's like really the key to life  is really to just live in the moment  and then  i go  you just said i'm a fucking dog 
[03:13:30]  for living in the moment  and then louie goes  yeah but like  you're like a bad dog  oh shit  wow man  Paul Reiser was a fucking breeze  yeah that was easy  Paul Reiser  and then i was going  oh anthony you'll like it  cause i did harvey keitel  doing Paul Reiser's ass  listen to me  men use the bar of soap  for the middle of their chest  there's no reason why  we have to soap  the middle of their chest  but men love that spot  every time we step in the shower 
[03:14:00]  we soak the middle of our chest  oh shit man  see that's fucking funny  oh  we had a good week man  i'm glad you're back  that shit is hard  yeah we had fun  fucking four hours  people calling you up  telling you you suck  yeah right  that's a treat isn't it  goes with the job  fucking assholes  as they do nothing  with their lives 
[03:14:30]  isn't that wonderful  this is my new thing  that i do  if i'm going to go on a radio  or a tv show  i go on that message board  for whatever show it is  and it's like a tv show  or whatever  like criminal intent  or whether it's Leno  and when they're all  like talking shit  and anything that's funny  on that message board  i bring to the show  and i take their own jokes  and i shove it up  clever strategy  the problem is  there's absolutely  nothing funny  on any message board

[03:24:00]  One more rant?  Yeah.  Before we get the fuck out of here?  Yeah, let it rip.  But then Coke Logic is after that.  Can we end with Coke Logic?  They get addictive, right?  Yeah, they do, man.  It's like potato chips.  You can't stop.  Charlie Roth, you made the finals with this.  Let's say hi to Bob Kelly.  I had to take my headphones off for that one. 
[03:24:30]  You're snoobering in there.  That was good.  And finally, yes, Coke Logic, you made the finals in the Most Annoying 30 Seconds Contest 
[03:25:00]  sponsored by Steven Singer.  Yes.  IHateStevenSinger.com  Do it again.  What are you doing again?  Look here because you are dead.  Yay.  Come on, Kim Kardashian.  Do it again.  This is turning into the funniest 30 seconds. 
[03:25:30]  That is fucking funny, man.  You don't even have to slow that down.  It's obnoxious at full speed.  Why did I do it?  That's addicting.  Because I think the last time we left it, it was more open-ended, so you could do whatever  you wanted.  So I think forcing the show audio in there is making me very funny. 
[03:26:00]  It's beautiful.  All right.  So that's six.  We got 19 finalists, so we'll play a lot more of these tomorrow.  Is there only one eliminated so far?  Yeah.  The rest are pretty good.  And Brandon, I feel bad.  I think...  I feel bad for David and Bobo.  That was the David and Bobo one?  That's the one you eliminated.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that just missed.  So we got another 13 to play tomorrow, and then we'll narrow it down.  We'll pick the finalists, and then we'll give out the money for my age. 
[03:26:30]  Steven's here.  I got a couple of shiraz that I will be cracking open.  Care of Greg, as they say, Opie Hughes.  Thank you.  And you know, the guy actually went to the...  I know Anne likes straws, and I go to this...  It's a pretty good wine store.  And the guy shows me this bottle. 
[03:27:00]  He goes, to the price, this bottle.  This.  No, no, not the one I got you.  He goes, this is it right here.  And the price is beautiful on this.  $39.99.  I'm like, if I give this fucking guy a bottle for less than 50 bucks after the bullshit I spew...  Yeah, because I'd have looked it up anyway.  Like you did with every bottle of wine.  But you said that's a good one.  Yes.  Because I don't know my shirazes, so enjoy that, man.  I certainly will.  And have a good birthday. 
[03:27:30]  Delish shirazes.  Yeah.  No working out today.  I get to just go home, fuck off, and do nothing.  Watch the rest of the wire.  Oh, you get past the docks?  I'm in the docks now.  Hang in there.  Yeah, I am.  I am.  I'm going to hang in there.  Hang in there.  Not as good as the first season.  I completely agree with you.  And I'm trying.  I'm pushing ahead.  I'm forging ahead.  I heard you got to break through that one.  Get to season three and everything's hunky-dory again.  Yeah.  But season one was just fucking great. 
[03:28:00]  Really great.  Just all the how they talk and the code.  Oh, I know.  Fantastic.  Just amazing.  Fucking roofless.  Them roofless motherfuckers.  All right.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  Nothing to listen to now.  So go check out some music and Rana Fez will be on.  There's plenty to listen to.  What?  Yeah.  You know that.  You were on the show yesterday.  I wasn't on the show.  You absolutely were.  By the way, way to be a good radio host.  You fucked up my one dumb bit yesterday.  What bit?  This is what Kenny told me.  You got Jim Norton on. 
[03:28:30]  All right.  We're going to get into this.  Yeah.  Oh, not good.  Exxon Profits up 60%.  Oh.  $100 million a day they've made for three months.  And we're paying $5 a gallon for gas.  Yeah.  Man.  So Project Mayhem needs to just happen.  Yeah, it does.  Project Mayhem.  Fight Club, brother.  Someone blow a smiling face into the side of a building so this can just end already.  Well, so it can start.  Someone's got to take the lead.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:29:00]  Talk to me about this bit.  Well, quick, because we've got to get in and out of here.  So I'm on the 10 o'clock hour from Kenny's truck.  Nothing special.  It was special.  I'll be honest with you.  It's the first time your ride home has been broadcast.  And then he has Jim Norton on.  And Kenny pulls up to the building.  So I go, hey, Jim, what are you going to be doing for Jay Leno?  You remember when I asked that?  Yeah.  Did he hear the car door slam really loud and no one fucking acknowledged?  And you guys just keep talking and acknowledge that nothing happened. 
[03:29:30]  No.  And then Jimmy gives the real answer.  Nobody heard any car door slam.  So you asked the question and then just slammed the door.  Yes.  It was a version of the hang up.  And then I scolded Kenny on the way in.  I'm like, you can't help me with my one dumb bit.  Well, it's not my fault.  Nobody heard it.  Because I didn't realize and they just kept talking.  So I don't like what Sam's saying right here.  It's not my fault.  You said he's a radio host.  You're supposed to go.  Everything is your responsibility.  I think he just slammed the car door in your face, Jim Norton. 
[03:30:00]  You're the commander.  You have to take responsibility.  You have to take responsibility.  You have to take responsibility.  You have to take responsibility.  You have to take responsibility.  You have to take responsibility.  You have to take responsibility.  But nobody heard you slam the car door.  You take responsibility for everything because you are the host.  I just gave you a bit for the 10 o'clock hour.  So now you can fucking play it and have Roland and Troy and E-Rock analyze the damn thing.  Why don't you stick around?  Why don't you stick around for a little bit?  Not today.  And stick around?  Get the fuck out of here.  Birthday show?  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  Oh, Jim Norton getting kicked by Anderson Silva is up on my channel. 
[03:30:30]  That's a good one.  Is it on Opie and Anthony?  On Facebook?  Opie and Anthony Facebook as well?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Make sure you check it out because it's way more impressive than I thought it was when it first happened.  We'll talk about me and you and talk about it on 10 o'clock.  Nope.  Check.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  The virus. </pre>
