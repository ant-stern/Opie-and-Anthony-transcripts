<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts introducing a new daily $1,000 giveaway contest.  Listeners had to call in after hearing the audio clip "I Like Turtles" played between 7 and 7:30 AM EST. The tenth caller would win.  The hosts mocked the supposed simplicity of the contest and the listeners' perceived inability to follow the rules.  They also discussed their recurring segments, "Phone Call Thursday" (deemed "the most useless dumbest radio promotional day"), "Perv News Thursday," and "Fun Fact Thursday," contributed by a caller "D" from Nevada, who shared facts about the longest one-handed typeable words.  The hosts then delved into their video game experiences with Half-Life 2: Episode Two and Portal, with Opie detailing his struggles with a boss battle and Anthony expressing his Portal addiction.  A substantial portion focused on playing audio clips of Yankee broadcaster Susan Waldman's emotional on-air reports, prompting humorous commentary and a debate about sexism.  A caller, "Ken" from Philly, refused to give Opie hockey tickets he possessed.  The $1,000 contest continued throughout the show, with numerous callers attempting to win, culminating in Phil from Boston securing the prize, although recording a proper promotional announcement proved challenging. Jim Norton was a guest in studio, and the hosts promoted his upcoming HBO special.  The show further involved discussions about the contestâ€™s success (or lack thereof), a feud with a Cleveland radio show, and a caller initially claiming to be a new listener but revealing themselves as a long-time fan.

A significant portion of the show featured comedian Mark Maron as a guest.  Maron discussed his recent divorce, attributing it to factors including his wife's book deal and his own personality flaws, referring to himself with terms like "mensch," "ass," and "douche." He detailed the emotional toll, the idealization phase, and the financial implications under California's 50/50 divorce laws.  He also promoted his upcoming New York City comedy shows, offering a discount code. The conversation ranged widely, touching upon his experiences in Scotland, observations on American culture (particularly obesity and consumerism), concerns about China's economic power, and personal struggles with jealousy and road rage, including humorous anecdotes about fantasizing about his partner with others.  He described a birthday celebration involving ice cream and strippers as an example of absurd coping mechanisms.  Anthony revealed his own recent divorce, and several callers shared their relationship woes, including infidelity, drug abuse, mental health issues, and other marital problems. One caller recounted his father abandoning his mother for a younger, crack-addicted prostitute. The hosts interjected with jokes and commentary, and a technical issue with a caller ("Everett"/"Jeffrey") provided additional comedic moments. The discussion veered into the subjective assessment of children's attractiveness.  Further discussion included the promotion of Maron's shows, drug commercials, absurd local news stories (like the Idaho "phantom shitter"), and 9/11 conspiracy theories.

A later segment focused on government surveillance and the Patriot Act, expressing concerns about potential abuse of power, particularly hypothetical scenarios involving blackmail and targeting based on online activity.  The conversation expanded to the pervasiveness of surveillance cameras, warrantless searches, outsourcing of government jobs, military recruitment, the impact of technology on critical thinking, and the reliability of information sources.  Mark Maron, again, was a guest and promoted his shows. The show concluded with the "Line of the Day" segment, further plugs for Maron's appearances, a rapid-fire list of items punctuated with "Fuck yeah," and audio clips from a Tonight Show appearance promoting the Opie and Anthony show.

[00:11:30]  lucky fan he gets to remind me next week yay by the way uh half the staff is uh a little  a little sleepy today no i don't even know if the word's sleepy it's not sleepy it's just my eyes  yeah my eyes are going crazy half-life 2 took out half the staff last night yeah half-life 2 what was  released yesterday or this week half-life 2 part 2 came out yesterday it's uh part of the the trilogy 
[00:12:00]  the new trilogy of uh half-life 2 and i was playing a little of that great game love the half-life  series uh but they added two other games along with it which is really cool like for the the price you're  paying for uh one game you get three games you get half-life you're actually getting more you get  half-life 2 part 1 half-life 2 part 2 and then you get um portals and you get team fortress 2 
[00:12:30]  uh so i was playing half-life 2 for a while pretty cool all in one box yeah all on one disc that's a  great idea yeah it's pretty good they uh they put everything out uh i think they had to because  everyone was so po'd that they took forever to come out with team fortress 2 which they were talking  about i swear to you probably about 10 years ago wow they were talking about team fortress 2 and it  just took forever to come out and it's really kick-ass i didn't get to play that um but i played 
[00:13:00]  uh half-life 2 part 2 i'm stuck on one mob that is just it's one of these situations where um and  this is what i like about the game it's not just run and shoot run and shoot run and shoot those get  pretty boring there's things you got to do they make it very difficult there is some creature that  looks like a giant praying mantis after me and i can't kill this thing i've pumped grenades into its  face uh machine guns the shotguns i throw grenades first before i jump down this little cliff that  prompts it to come out and then you can't jump back up the cliff so you're you're committed to battle 
[00:13:30]  this thing so then i i backtracked through the entire game picked up uh first aid kits and then  i'm throwing them all over the place where i'm gonna have to battle this thing so i could kind of get  some health back as uh i'm fighting it and it just with one swipe just knocks me off a cliff and i  plummet to my death and i can't figure it out uh you don't really have a life do you uh no i have  half-life why would i know exactly exactly you have half a life i don't need whole life i play half-life 
[00:14:00]  half-life brian half-life even if you got whole life you could play half-life you got half a life  half-life yeah but uh so i got i got stuck there for a little bit so i was able to uh save the game  pause right there you know to put it away for a little bit and play portholes and this game is  hysterical because it really doesn't have a purpose but it's addicting as all hell you have a like a gun 
[00:14:30]  type thing it's first person perspective and you can shoot a porthole into let's say uh the wall  oh we got dummies listening uh you you shoot a porthole it's like a hole in the wall just a hole  just say a hole yeah you shoot a hole in the wall yeah then you shoot a hole in the floor yeah if you  jump into the hole in the floor you'll pop out the hole you made in the wall see so like there's  it comes in handy when let's say there's um a machine gun automated machine gun turret that you have 
[00:15:00]  to take out you gotta kind of put a hole above it and then find a box and put a hole under the box  now the box will drop through the one hole you made and fall out the other hole you made you can  only make two holes at a time and it'll fall on the machine gun and you you go along your way so it's a  little puzzle game jimmy's looking at me it's a puzzle game yeah it's a puzzle game don't even turn  me on to this crap man with my ocd i would i would play portal it's so addictive i would play this one 
[00:15:30]  that's the one i was playing like for for a few hours last night fan got it like yesterday yeah i  discovered portals at 10 30 last night unfortunately oh yeah i'm a little uh a little woozy a little yeah  blind and tired it gets the first couple are easy they're just kind of training you how to use the  thing but then it gets to the point where the puzzles are so intricate that you got to go through  about five or six steps to get through these things you shoot a portal and and you got to launch yourself 
[00:16:00]  over a wall that's just seemingly impossible so you got to find a real high place to go shoot down about  like 50 feet and make a hole so that the speed you build up falling through the hole launches you out  of the hole you made in the wall so if you're falling the speed you build up falling yeah is  transmitted to the same speed as you come out of the wall so then you could launch yourself and fly 
[00:16:30]  over another wall if you need to and then there's one part me and danny were laughing at because you  actually had to jump through a hole and as you're falling shoot another hole real quick in the floor  and jump through and fall into that hole in order to pop out the correct oh my god hysterical  very addicting uh porthole yes or portal portal or porthole however you say it five minutes and  realize i didn't know what i was doing and i would break the thing but the the thing is and and it's a  good thing the way uh half-life and and all the games have been over the years they really give you 
[00:17:00]  good training at the beginning of the game they run you through the training course so if you don't  know how to use anything they kind of make it interesting and fun it's not just like you got to run  through and learn how to use it they do it like in game kind of and uh really show you how to use  everything all the weapons so you're not stuck and lost i'm a big fan of uh puzzle games i would get  into this one well that's why i like uh half-life especially the first one when it came out in like  i think it was 98 yeah it was just it blew all the other games away because it wasn't just run and 
[00:17:30]  shoot but it wasn't like that lara croft jumping game where you know you just spend eight hours  trying to jump from one cliff to another falling to your death every two seconds and have to do the  whole thing over again you know you bring up a great point i think that game wrecked it for me as  far as those type of games go i did used to play lara croft and you would get so far within a board  and you couldn't do the next move and like you just said you have to go all the way back they 
[00:18:00]  didn't have like uh yeah unlimited saves that's what i like unlimited saves i get through a point  it's like wait why should i have to do it again i did it not people like oh unlimited saves you  should only have a certain amount of saves it's like wait a minute i got through this part let me  save it so i don't have to do it again it's not like i'm cheating i got through it because the  pressure you feel when you get to that point where you know you just suck at you know knowing  you're gonna have to go all the way back it's not fun at that point no it's not and lara croft did it  to me tomb raiders i all those type of games i stopped playing because of that yeah maybe i 
[00:18:30]  should get back into it again half-life's a great game to play because uh you uh you don't have to  go through that you have unlimited saves and then there's like puzzle things that you got to work  out but not stupid puzzle things like in order to get from point a to point b and get on to the  next mission or thing you have to do you might have to go through five or six steps of going back  turning something on then back upstairs right and then you got to find something to make a 
[00:19:00]  generator work and then plug something in so there's like a lot of little things you got to  do in order to get along and all that time something's trying to kill you or head crabs  jump out of nowhere and scare the crap out of you do you need help getting past that section  um no no i don't i don't use cheat codes i don't want spoilers ah cheat code i rule no  walkthroughs walkthroughs no no no no no no you know who's a big fan of the cheat code  well steve steve is mr cheek he goes to god mode and unlimited ammo the second he loads the game for 
[00:19:30]  the first time actually everyone has their rules actually i hate cheat codes but i do love walkthroughs  i'm like look if i can find a walkthrough and then figure out half the time you can't even figure it  out after you read the walkthrough because these dummies don't know how to write it the right way  i've used a walkthrough but i will only use it i swear to you if i've gone probably four hours trying  to get through something right i don't mind not for the life of me figure it out i don't do the cheat 
[00:20:00]  codes because then it gets just never never cheat code though this gets boring no unless you could  like uh you know use cheat codes to like all of a sudden make bikini models show up everywhere  some ridiculous oh yeah like something like that is cool the best cheat code was in grand theft auto  where i forgot exactly what it was but bikini babes followed you for the whole game but they kept  coming from all directions so by the time you yeah i mean after uh throwing this cheat code in within a  minute you had hundreds of bikini babes following you yeah and now you can't get anything done 
[00:20:30]  because they're just all following you i used to love that dumb cheat code on uh grand theft auto i liked  when you were able to put a code in to uh get the pixelation off of the sims right so when they  would go in the shower they'd be completely naked we were all searching to find that one for a while  there was a cheat code uh i love sports games too uh one of the hockey games where you can make certain  players really really ridiculously large like giant on the ice it was hilarious and it's funny and you  have a tiny little like you know skater like you know battling this monster and the guy would get 
[00:21:00]  so big it would pretty much take up just about the whole screen and all of a sudden he's going  down ice with this tiny puck shooting at the goal some uh some board engineer is uh at the  software engineers so i guess what i'm trying to say then i i use the cheat codes just to get silly  with my gaming not to actually yeah you know try to beat the game i won't use cheat codes bill from  waterford goodness gracious the opiate anthony staff has been taken out by the orange blocks the orange 
[00:21:30]  box you should see the ona staff it's wonderful anthony is nodding his head jimmy norton doesn't care  jimmy's completely disgusted at the way they talk about video games jimmy's jimmy is saying nerds  i wish i knew to play them i would probably like them a lot yeah i don't play any of them you probably  would i think i would there's a few games out there you'd probably love man i mean and now with 
[00:22:00]  the nice uh computers we all have with the screens and the letterbox and stuff it's just  it's the screen is huge and and by the way it's no different than when your your parents told you  not to sit that close to the television because i cannot have a big enough monitor i want to feel  like i am in the game and you sit so close that you're you're you're like inches from the the monitor  right i'm actually moving my head up and down to look at what i'm doing hey what shouldn't have to do 
[00:22:30]  that whatever happened and we were one of the first people to introduce pretty much the world to this  uh those the video game glasses oh the goggles they never really took off the resolution just  stunk maybe the old listeners when we were at any w we were one of the first people to have those yeah  and you hook it up to your console like your playstation or whatever and then you could play  the game on the ceiling or whatever and it would look like a virtually a big screen television even  though it's little screens right next to your eyeballs i used to turn off all the lights in my 
[00:23:00]  house and my brother would come over and he would get freaked out because he would hear these  noises coming from the living room and he's like playing a game sneaking around my apartment i would  be laying on my couch with these goggles on pitch dark and the whole screen was my ceiling yeah it  was awesome yeah those things and i was they weren't very good resolution we probably have brain cancer  or something because they never came out with a second generation of those things so something went  horribly wrong no i used to watch uh tv with them i was i hooked it up to my uh cable box and i was able 
[00:23:30]  to watch tv without disturbing the girlfriend because she didn't like the tv being on and you're  just sitting there you put the earplugs in you lay down you're watching tv yeah that would and the  room is pitch black those things never took off unfortunately they were trying to use our show to  get the the word out and uh i don't know they they they just whatever something happened to that  whole uh fall asleep burn out your retinas all right eyelids uh speaking of susan wallman uh  susan wallman we haven't played the latest clip from jimmy jim heard it jimmy uh susan wallman was 
[00:24:00]  crying because joe torrey's probably going to be let go sure but now they're saying that uh you know  some of the players are fighting for him to stay but it's not about that it's about susan wallman uh  crying as she's doing her uh dugout report or clubhouse report yeah the yankees lost well it was  very emotional with joe torrey uh hanging his his career hanging by the skin of his teeth  as they say by the way dan from ohio is writing boring sorry dan but there are a lot of gamers

[00:32:00]  nice lady and stuff broad but she's very dramatic when she's talking about her beloved yankees even  though it's so obvious she's from boston yeah she's got the very thick boston accent she's a  yankee fan um well she's a yankee fan because they're the ones that got her a job yeah they got  her the gig i i kind of think i i don't know her as a person she could be the nicest person ever  but to me she just sounds ridiculous yeah in whatever she's saying well she just sounds ridiculous 
[00:32:30]  well we got the famous susan wallman clip about uh of all the dramatic things goodness gracious do  we have that yeah why don't we play it one last time this has been all time one of my favorite clips  uh so far of the year and know what's funny about listening to this clip now you know she she finds  out for the first time live uh during a yankee broadcast that roger clemens is coming to the  yankees yeah and the whole thing was roger clemens was going to save the team they sucked at this  point let's remember the yankees really just were just blowing yep and they're bringing roger 
[00:33:00]  clemens aboard and the team did turn around obviously so that i guess that would that that  kind of helped the team but they they brought him back to the yankees to win in the playoffs  and now we all know he lasted two and a third innings and he was a bust it was a ridiculous and he  gave the most uninspired speech ever this idiot stands up in starmer in his box like well  something i'll be talking to y'all again soon yeah well yeah saying what i'm sorry for the  postseason yeah he's not talking to that right uh reminded me of um like when you used to watch

[00:34:30]  rest of the year i'm on the road all day but ken i didn't do that on purpose to the phillies i  really wanted them to win it all this year it just happens i don't know about that but that's why  he won't give me the tickets to see the islanders uh play the flyers in philly because of the  sports cars i can't make it to the game his girl's from philly so he had a natural uh uh  inclination to go for philly after uh the mets proud that's right i don't know man all right  ken i get it you sour grapes ken all right here's the uh original susan waldman clip thank you all

[00:48:30]  this is the clip  they're all talking about today  then he said something  that everybody  we're in the room  we all looked at each other  he said this  Yankee team  has a great future  it's got a lot of young kids  um  there is no question  about the ability  of these people  they're very impressive  um  he said  you think it's going  to last forever  and  this is rough  he's your friend  he said  this is  this has been  the best 12 years 
[00:49:00]  of my life  I wouldn't have missed  this for anybody  now I was okay  actually  until I went into  the clubhouse  and the coaches  are sitting in  Tori's office  and they are  watching this  and the tears  that you hear  in my voice  are coming down  the faces  of the coaches  in that coaches room  yeah  I'm absolutely  crying over here  you know who else  is crying  you blubbering idiot  get the hoot thing  get the hoot thing  the fans  yeah  that wanted ticket prices  to go through the roof  when they brought 
[00:49:30]  that lump  Alex Rodriguez in  who has been  thank god  a bust  another 50 year  old pitcher  playoff  kryptonite  that's who  should be crying  Randy Johnson's  back surgeon  is smiling  nobody else  there's no crying  in baseball  oh it's just  revolting what  they've done  so Newsday  wrote a little  article  and we're  very suspicious  I think they're  talking about us  because we  made the article  yesterday  David Hinckley  pointed out  that we were  goofing on that  exact clip  by playing  the smokers  laugh under it 
[00:50:00]  yeah  and pretty much  everyone else  handled that  with class  yeah  they just  discussed it  and  for the most part  I'm sure  there's gotta be  another show  out there  that goofed on it  we just completely  goofed on it  Susan Wallman's  teary report  from the Yankees  clubhouse  late Monday night  has been a source  of amusement  on the radio  on the internet  and in print  across the continent  to her though  there is nothing  funny about that  this one's  getting me angry  because I don't  play this card 
[00:50:30]  a lot  but this is  as sexist  as it gets  is it  the Yankees  radio analysis  said yesterday  what's the big  damn deal  that I cried  for four seconds  of a ten minute  post game  the idea  that I can't  choke up  because a man  I went through  cancer with  eleven years ago  is gonna lose  his job  and I was  describing his  coaches crying  it's absolutely  ludicrous  I'm not Walter  Cronkite  she said  who are these  Cronkite cried  exactly  when Kennedy  was assassinated  not when a  five billion dollar 
[00:51:00]  payroll  lost to a team  in the Midwest  you idiot  exactly  of course you're  not Walter  Cronkite  you're more  masculine than  he was  yeah  Cronkite  teared up  a little bit  when he announced  JFK was dead  exactly  and he had  just heard it  you know  well  she goes  I'm not Walter  Cronkite  she said  who are these  arbiters of  journalism  who are ripping  me on the  radio  that would be  Opie  and Anthony  yeah  like we're 
[00:51:30]  gonna go hide  because now  it's in an article  oh god  it's uh  she's  she's mad at us  it's Mike  and the mad dog  no it's Opie  and Anthony  we think it's  hilarious  when people cry  she's crying  like a bitch  there Mikey  unbelievable  it was the second  time in five months  Waldman was  criticized  and or mocked  for her emotions  on the air  in May  well we know  what happened  in May  the Roger  Clemens  announcement  I almost  understood  the Clemens  one  because I  did get  excited  it was  during the  game  she said  but who  decided 
[00:52:00]  all this  the rules  change all  the time  it's  oh you're  a journalist  for Pete's  sake  I'm not  Walter  Cronkite  I'm not  talking about  Iraq  she said  for Pete's  sake  I'm talking  about a man  who is so  loved in this  city and we  all know  what's going  to happen  I actually  thought I  was very  poetic  I'm very  surprised  how it  got out  that smoothly  poetic  Waldman called  the reaction  anti-female  and insisted  she serves  a valuable  role  I take it  seriously  that I'm  a conduit  between  that locker  room and  fans 
[00:52:30]  she said  every person  was so busy  ripping me  for crying  they didn't  hear what  I was saying  if I got  choked up  doing it  so what  we just  we just  find crying  especially in  sports  hilarious  yeah  hilarious  it's sports  exactly  and they're  they're crying  I mean  who doesn't  find except  for Philly  of course  well  she's a big  Muppet face  I love Susan  Waldman's big  Muppet face  doesn't she have 
[00:53:00]  a Muppety face  is a tear  rolling down  that cloth face  she certainly  does  Eric can you  show another  Muppet face  picture of Susan  Waldman  get a Muppet  face picture  of her up there  I want to see  that  blithering idiot  she's your  friend  she should be  crying when she  watches that  money be thrown  in front of an  oscillating fan  and blown  into Scott  Burroughs'  pocket  that bum  Alex Rodriguez  who has won  nothing but a  pseudo hooker  in Toronto  photos  you dummy 
[00:53:30]  perfect  yeah  perfect  that's worth  tearing up  over  but it's not  a sexist  thing  we just  find crying  in sports  really really  entertaining  like here's  the Mike  Schmidt one  from 18  years ago  I left  Dayton Ohio  with two  very bad  knees  and a dream  to become a  major league  baseball player  I thank God  the dream  came true 
[00:54:00]  dream came true  he's crying  because his  knees are sore  how can you  not find that  funny  that's great  Mike Schmidt  was one of the  greatest baseball  players ever  when we had the  tour down there  in Philly  they have a  plaque right  outside the  clubhouse  I took the  picture  I'm like wow  look at that  it's a tampon  and a hanky  you man up  your fruit  you threw a  ball around  for a few  years  so what 
[00:54:30]  this has been  our bit  for years  and Susan  Wallman's the  latest casualty  we just love  when people  break down  on live TV  in front of  the media  or as part  of the media  and then of  course you got  this famous  clip that we  love the  wrestling fan  I just want  to thank each  and every one  of y'all  for all you've  done to your  bodies  it's still  real to me  damn it  I mean  take it easy  man  you're awesome  thank you so  much Mr. 
[00:55:00]  for saying  what needed  to be said  I don't  want to see  another one  of these  and I don't  even give a  crap what  he's crying  over  it's just  funny  it's just  he is the  best  it's so  real to me  and we'll  introduce a  new one  for a lot  of people  out there  we worked  with this  guy at  XM  what was  his name  again  Bruce  what was  Bruce's  last name  Bruce Kelly  right  Bruce Kelly  you know  a radio guy  that's been  around a really  long time  he's no longer  with XM 
[00:55:30]  satellite radio  but XM  was doing  this thing  what was  it  the  yeah  live  eight  okay  and  Bruce Kelly  got to go  overseas  and  and the  who  performed  yeah  and I guess  they had  some kind  of video  montage  of probably  like starving  kids  because you  know  that's the  video that  always gets  us in  concert  where they  have to  show where  the rest  of the world  is suffering  and we're  great  yeah  and maybe  we should  take some  of our  greatness  and help  the rest  of the  world  and they're  selling  eight dollar  bottled  water  thing 
[00:56:00]  that a lot  of rock  acts do  in concert  yeah  to make  you get  emotional  so I think  I think  they had  some kind  of video  of starving  children  before  or during  or after  the who  performed  but the who  was the thing  that really  got them  yeah  so here's  Bruce Kelly  live on the  air  representing  all of XM  at live  eight overseas  they see  he look  he saw  the band  went back  to the two  people that  were on the  air  and was  supposed to  report  on the  who's  their 
[00:56:30]  little segment  of the  show  right  oh by the  way  awful me  great  there's  some feedback  coming in  that accent  could read  Shakespeare  and it  wouldn't be  poetic  yeah  she thought  it was  poetic  yeah  here's  Bruce Kelly  crying  is this  live  yes  we're  live  Bruce  where were  you buddy  I was  right up  under  these  so  you know  it's  amazing  watching  P-Towns  and Roger  Daltrey  perform  these songs  after all  these years  and still  have the  full spirit 
[00:57:00]  of what  they do  under  control  I mean  you know  Townsend  just continues  to be an  amazing guitar  player  I'm sorry  I'm absolutely  crying  I can't help it  I really can't  this is no  fake  the whole  moment  just kind of  got to me  with that  video  yeah  the video  was very  powerful  yeah  that was  this is  very awkward  I'm sorry  but  it was just  very  I mean  you know  it's just  the who  I can't  help but  be a 14  year old 
[00:57:30]  kid out  there  with the  who  and  that's  it  sorry  you were  seeing them  live  I guess  that was  in color  yeah  yeah  they were  live on stage  but the black  and white  was happening  on the big  screen too  so  through your  tears  wow  through your  tears  two more  to go  here  at Hyde  Park  and the  crowd  I feel like  an idiot  I'm sorry  really  no  no  you are  that's  overwhelming  that's what  this you know  that really is  what this is all  about  there are certain  moments that touch  everybody  no what's great about  turning into fruits  maybe a little too 
[00:58:00]  inside but the guy  at the end of that  is George Taylor  Morris  he's a legendary  radio jock  he's seen it all  and I know he probably  wants to go look  look ass  lighten up  lighten up  I used to do drugs  with Jim Morrison  and jump off roofs  get a hold of yourself  it's the stupid who  20 years past their prime  and that's not what  it's all about  it's about helping  starving children  not about an  overweight man  remembering his own  stupid privilege  boyhood  14 years old  seeing the who  and being a happy  suburban kid again  that was a real moment 
[00:58:30]  I respect him  because it was a real moment  but like George Taylor  Morris should have  been like  come on dude  what are you doing  it's the who  and then the other  the girl there  was like  she is great  all dramatic  through your tears  through your tears  you wanker  through your tears  you poofed her  she used to work  for XM  her mother was  the weakest link lady  yeah  that was her mother  yep  so what are we  what are we going to  do next here

We need a nice promo that runs all day long here, Phil.  You're going to be a star all day.  All right, so you know what you're going to say?  I won $1,000.  Okay.  I like turtles.  I'm stupid, Phil.  I'm stupid, Phil.  Oh, come on.  You can't take any direction.  You can't take any direction.  La, la, la, la.  And the Red Sox are going to blow it. 
[01:09:30]  I don't think so, dude.  And Tom Brady's going to break his leg.  Wow.  All right.  Why don't we get the promo?  Why don't you help him out here?  All right, Phil.  Yep, yep.  Now you're going to say, I'm Phil from Boston, and I just won $1,000 listening to the Opie  and Anthony show.  I love Opie and Anthony.  And I love turtles.  Yes.  With excitement, sir.  Seriously. 
[01:10:00]  Come on now.  With excitement like a real hack radio station.  That's right.  Let's go.  Hi, I'm Phil from Boston, and I just won $1,000 listening to Opie and Anthony.

[01:10:30]  I'm not going to call you a script.  The moment you say it, I forget what you said.  He made it his own.  All right, listen.  I'm going to put you on hold.  Line one.  Uh-oh.  Phil, I'm dead serious.  You just won $1,000, all right?  Well, hey, guys.  Thanks a lot, man.  You guys rock.  All right.  Fuck off.  Wait a minute.  You can't tell the winners of contests to F off, Opie.  It's not the good protocol.  F off. 
[01:11:00]  He's a clam, and I will.  All right, Phil.  Jesus, how long are we going to do this?  For a month?  Oh, my God.  And every day, we're going to be just as obnoxious.  All right, Phil.  Hey, thanks, guys.  You rock.  There you go.  You're the inaugural winner of this contest.  And now I've got to figure out which button puts Phil on hold.  Is it this one?  Uh-oh.  You better check this in.  Oh, boy.  What if we lose him?  What is the ruling?  Do we have to get another winner?

Let me try that again.  We'll have another chance to win $1,000 tomorrow between 7 a.m. and 7.30 a.m.  Today's winner is from Boston.  Very good. 
[01:12:00]  And you want to pick the clip right now that they have to listen for for tomorrow?  Yes.  Sometime between 7 and 7.30 tomorrow, we're going to play that.  You call 877-212-0&A.  If you're the 10th caller, you will get abused and you'll win $1,000.  Courtesy of your pals. 
[01:12:30]  Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Jim Norton in studio.  I forgot to mention Saturday, my HBO special premieres at 10 o'clock.  So if you want to watch that, it's on Saturday.  How could you forget to mention that, Jimmy?  Did I plug a Danbury, Connecticut gig?  I know.  The HBO special.  That's why I'm a zilcher.  Let's see.  Finally.  Should I promote a gig that's going to sell out in five minutes  and there's going to be about 100 people there 
[01:13:00]  because you decided to play smaller clubs and work on your next hour?  Yep.  Or should I plug something that's going to be on HBO and seen by millions?  Yes.  So this Saturday, the 13th.  That is very exciting, Jimmy.  877-212-0&A.  If you're trying to get a hold of us, it's Jocelyn from New Jersey.  What's up?  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hello?  Hi.  Yeah, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  What's going on?  Not much.  I was calling to say good morning. 
[01:13:30]  Okay.  Ah, because it's phone call.  I was heading home from the gym this morning and I heard the whole I love turtles thing.  Okay.  And I thought it was a sign.  So I got in my car early to go sit on Route 80 and I kept dialing in and my phone sucks  because Nextel sucks.  So it kept cutting out and...  How's that?  It just cut out again.  Here's tomorrow's clip if you want to win $1,000.  We're going to play this between 7 and 7.30 tomorrow when you hear it.  Yes.  Very easy. 
[01:14:00]  Call us at 877-212-0&A.  If you're the 10th caller, you're going to win $1,000.  We can't make it any more simple than that.  Yes.  This isn't for now.  No.  It's for tomorrow.  This is tomorrow's sound.  Yes.  Ara, what's up, Ara?  Hi.  Hi.  What are you doing?  I just wanted to check that I had the right phone number.  Ah, make sure you have the right phone number for the contest.  You're going to be listening all month long try to win $1,000. 
[01:14:30]  I like turtles, but it didn't get me anywhere.  Oh, no, huh?  Do you like the Opie and Anthony show?  I do now.  Yeah.  Yeah, you do now.  That's what we want to hear.  All right.  What is your favorite Opie and Anthony bit?  We've been on the air for quite a long time now.  I just started listening yesterday.  Yesterday.  All right.  We got a name for you.  New listener.  Yeah.  Well, one of many names we have.  All right. 
[01:15:00]  So, how did you hear that there was a contest going on?  Well, I turned on the radio and you got my attention and I heard I like turtles and I thought it was funny.  And we started listening again this morning, but we didn't win.  All right.  Now, what do you know about the show so far?  You've been listening for about a day, a couple hours.  What do you like about it so far?  I think you guys are hysterical.  Oh.  So, why didn't you listen to us before now? 
[01:15:30]  I don't know because I like the different station, I guess.  What station did you...  106.3.  What is 106.3?  What is that?  What is that?  What kind of...  G-Rock.  G-Rock?  What is G-Rock?  G-Rock?  Progressive?  What's G-Rock?  Progressive.  G.  G.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Where is it?  It's in Jersey.  That's the station that does Tubes Day.  Tubes Day?  Oh, you're a fan of Tubes Day?  You like Tubes Day? 
[01:16:00]  No, I never heard of that.  Oh.  Are you sure you got the right station?  Are you?  They play like world new music.  All right.  So, basically, you're a prize pig, and now you're going to listen to us for a month because  we're giving away $1,000.  Absolutely.  You're really just in this for the money, aren't you?  Not necessarily.  That's how you got my attention, but I might stick with you.  Okay.  I think you guys are great.  Very funny.  You had me laughing all yesterday.  All right.  We get it.  The audio. 
[01:16:30]  Sorry.  Wait.  We had you laughing yesterday.  What made you laugh about the Opie and Anthony show?  You guys are obnoxious.  Obnoxious.  Yes, we are obnoxious.  Listen for this tomorrow.  Between 7 and 7.30.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da 
[01:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  God, people hate him.  Well, old school from Grand Rapids, Michigan.  I can't even say that.  He's going to be all bummed.  Old school from Grand Rapids, Michigan.  You guys need a dumb contest to boost ratings. 
[01:17:30]  Wow, you have sunk to a new low.  Hack.  Hmm.  I don't know if he's kidding or not, but, yeah, we're doing this to get ratings.  You're absolutely right.  No, we're just giving away cash, stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're absolutely right.  So now what?  Now what?  That's the only reason anybody does anything entertaining on the radio is to get ratings.  Right.  Yeah.  If they would pay you the same and say, we don't care what the ratings are, we would all just 
[01:18:00]  sit here and, like, talk to each other without headphones and not care whether you heard it  or not.  Yeah.  Big breaks of dead air.  Yeah.  I just talk to my pal.  Just get up and go to the bathroom at any time you want.  Penny, Long Island.  Penny's like the show.  Yeah.  Penny, what's up?  Hi.  I just wanted to let you know I'm a long-time listener, and I just thought that it was hysterical,  the contest that you just did.  Dear Penny.  Oh, thank you, Penny.  Thank you, Penny.  Woo!  Yeah, we're going to do that.  The lead-up was so funny, and then busting everybody when they went to the 10th caller 
[01:18:30]  was just hysterical.  That's something people don't do on radio because the PD tells you don't do that.  Yeah, because you don't want to, like, insult or piss off a listener.  Or make the listeners mad, so never take the call from, like, the 9th caller if you're taking  the 10th call.  Who gives a crap, man?  That's what you want to hear when you're driving around and they do this type of stuff.  Who wants the polished crap?  You want to hear, like, the disappointment in someone's voice when they're the 9th caller.  And usually they tell you not even to talk to them.  You just plunk the lines down and go, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
[01:19:00]  You hang up on them, and then you take the 10th.  So they don't know that they were.  So they don't even know that they were.  Because you want them all to think that they were that close and have a chance, so they  keep listening.  We like to wallow.  Wallow in it.  We love wallowing in it.  Thank you, Penny.  Thank you, Tranny Voice.  Jocelyn's back.  Jocelyn, New Jersey, what's going on?  Didn't we just talk to you?  Yeah, I missed you guys already.  It's been a whole five minutes since my phone cut out again. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, your phone cut out.  What service do you have?  What do you have, that iPhone?  I have Nextel.  Oh, see.  Nextel.  All right, so where were we when your phone cut out?  I was over by the Rockwood Mall, Rudy.  No one cares.  No one cares.  I mean, as far as our conversation was going.  Yeah, where were you?  Not literally, where were you?  Well, I was telling you guys I like turtles, and it was a sign that I should have called  this morning.  Yeah, I know.  We got through that.  Oh, we were asking you what, you've been listening for only a day, right? 
[01:20:00]  Oh, right.  No, not me.  Not me.  I've been listening to you guys for years, and I'm glad you guys came back.  Hmm.  Our story changed.  Or, oh, wait, you're the other, uh, wait.  Yeah.  I'm the first girl.  So what happened when your phone hung up?  I don't know.  I stood there, and I looked at it, and I'm like, oh, crap, I got a call back?  Well, what were we talking about at that very moment?  Did we ask you a question or something?  Nope, nothing.  My phone just died, so you can go ahead and ask a question now if you want. 
[01:20:30]  No, that's all right.  Get lost.  Uh, Anita.  Hi, did I win?  I love turtles.  Hello, who's this?  Anita from Long Island.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Anita.  Debbie?  Is it Debbie?  I mean, hello?  Uh, who is this?  Debbie?  Debbie?  Yeah.  Anita?  Yeah.  Wait, who do we got in line?  Anita?  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  Seriously.  Look, listen, guys, I didn't think I'd go through it.  Wait, who do we?  Hold on a minute.  We got Debbie or Anita?  Anita.  Oh, we have Anita online.  I'm here.  I, uh, wait.  Hi, Debbie.  Hi, Anita.  How you doing?  I'm good.  How are you?  Hey, just put a big loser on my head.  I called, I just called the number to make sure that it was the right number for the contest. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, I think you got the right number.  Oh.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Hello?  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Five minutes from now, they'll be treating brownie recipes.  Stupid toilet cleaners.  Toilet cleaners.  Yes, both of you are caller 638.  Right.  I think you just missed.  The contest ended about 25 minutes ago.  Why are you still calling?  Okay, listen. 
[01:22:00]  Oof.  What?  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  I just called to make sure I had the right number.  I didn't think actually I would be on the radio.  Now, why didn't you have the number before this?  Pardon me?  Why didn't you have the number before this contest?  Do you listen to the show?  Oh, absolutely.  Every day.  My son turned me on to it months ago.  Oh.  Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you something that's a little weird?  When someone gives me a phone number in my regular life, like, hey, you know, if you need some 
[01:22:30]  painting done, here's my phone number, I don't sit there and then check to see if it's the  right number.  Let me call.  I just assume it's the number.  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, do you want some painting done?  No.  I just want to make sure this is the right number.  Right number.  So when I do need some painting, I know that I won't get a wrong number.  Why would you check to make sure it's the right number?  Jim, are you there?  Who the hell's Jim?  Oh, Jim Norton. 
[01:23:00]  Yes, ma'am.  Of course.  It's the precocious James Norton.  I'm here and slightly hurt, miss.  The same part, I really meant that, like, but I thought there might be another Jim on the  wall.  All right, sorry.  I'm here, madam.  All right, go ahead.  You're talking to Jim.  Okay.  You're talking to Jim.  Yeah, I'm right here, miss.  Yeah, Jim, I'm going to watch your HBO special.  You're awesome.  Who isn't?  Thank you, miss. 
[01:23:30]  But that was just kind of an anti-climax.  You're going to sweep the nation.  I was eating fruit on the other side of the room, and I ran over to the mic.  We want to be considered awesome, too, but if we continue with your phone call, people  aren't going to think we're as awesome as we really are.  No.  The awesome gauge is going down.  All right.  We need to fill up with some awesome.  Yeah, right now we're tools.  Yes.  All right, we've got to say goodbye to Anita and Debbie, the prize pigs.  The low awesome light is on.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  The awesome alert is...  It went up.  Is that a green?  No?  No.  Hello?  All right.  Thanks, ladies.  We've got to get rid of those prize pigs.  That's what we have to deal with for the next month.  Thank you, Tracy.  Thank you.  This is how we're going to get people listening.  Great.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Let's say hi to Gene in Connecticut.  Gene?  Yeah.  Hi, Anthony.  Anthony?  Yeah, what's up, Gene?  Nothing much.  Everything's good.  Love you guys. 
[01:24:30]  Great show.  Thank you.  Wanted to tell you, it's a funny bid you did against the Maxwell show in Cleveland that  time.  What did we do?  Well, you know, the whole thing with the and punt and the...  And punt.  Well, anyway, I called the radio station and I wanted to tell him that because you guys  gave away the number.  Right.  And the guy picked up the phone and, you know, he's like, yeah, dude, what's up?  I guess they all talk to people that way.  The dude thing, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they're just a bunch of radio posers. 
[01:25:00]  We put out a challenge and, of course, they didn't take our challenge, so we're done with  that dopey show.  You know, they think their guy's funnier than Jim Norton and we were confused.  We thought he was a comedian.  So we're like, all right, send in your best set and we'll play it uninterrupted on our  show.  Yeah.  And we talked to close to two million people a day, so that would be great exposure for  a guy that's kind of doing radio in Cleveland.  And then his excuse was, well, I'm not a stand-up comic.  I don't do comedy clubs.  And they're saying that he's just funnier on the radio.  So then we said, okay, send the funniest thing you've ever done on a radio show to our show 
[01:25:30]  and we'll play it uninterrupted for two million people.  And that'd be great exposure for this guy that's hanging out doing radio in Cleveland.  And, of course, there's a new excuse.  So we're just done with these idiots because they're just a bunch of radio posers.  Well, anyway, and I told the guy, I started telling him how much they suck and he's like,  well, look, you obviously listen to them, you know, trying to paint me out as kind of  like a passionate listener.  Yeah.  And I said, well, actually, the only reason why I know who you guys are was because of 
[01:26:00]  the old Peter and Anthony show.  And he's like, okay, thank you, thank you.  And then he just hung up on it.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, we like beating up on those guys, too, but I think we're done with them because, you  know, we threw out a realistic challenge and they pushed out.  And they started it.  We didn't even know who they were.  We didn't start trashing.  Yeah.  Who the hell are they?  We'd never heard of them.  And all of a sudden, we got audio of them just bashing us.  Right.  All right, Gene.  Cheers.  Thank you, Gene.  All right.  And by the way, we love Cleveland.  Good afternoon, Cleveland.  Good afternoon, man.  Let's say hi to Mike in Boston. 
[01:26:30]  Mike.  Cleveland.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hello.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up?  Not much.  Just calling.  Say good morning.  I love listening to the show.  So, and I think you're right.  Jim Norton's much funnier than that other guy was.  Thank you, sir.  Why are you calling?  Huh?  I'm checking up on the High Love Turtles things.  What was the sound for tomorrow?  Oh, my gosh.  This contest is going to be all-consuming on this program. 
[01:27:00]  Tomorrow, listen for this.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha.  Between 7 and 7.30.  Holy crap.  I can't even tell you how much I despise that sound from that song.  It's a funny song, though.  Yeah.  Come on.  Shut up.  It is not.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha.  See?  It is not funny.  Within a week, you'll be walking around your place going, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha. 
[01:27:30]  I don't doubt it, but it's horrible.  It'll be as great as this one was.  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha.  Oh, the worst.  Jimmy, you got one?  I just like that one.  That's my favorite.  No, I mean, do you do it or what?  Oh.  Like, I even do a little thing with my arms.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha.  I just go, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, and then I throw my arms open, and whoever's next to 
[01:28:00]  me finishes it.  Ah, there you go.  That's how I meet people.  Except me.  Yeah.  Come on.  I will not be party to that.  You are a stick in the mud.  Call me a stick in the mud.  Corinne, what's going on?  Stick you in the mud.  Oh, my God.  I just heard the sound clip.  I've got the phrase that pays.  Hi, Corinne.  Oh, Jesus.  Corinne?  Yeah?  Jeff in Buffalo, what's up?  You guys are killing me with this contest.  Why? 
[01:28:30]  It's bad, right?  It's hilarious.  You need to do this all day, every day.  Aren't we?  Exactly.  That's the problem.  Jesus.  We agreed to this dumb thing because we're like, okay, we'll play a clip real fast, and  we'll continue to do our fine radio show, and maybe we'll get more people listening.  Who knows?  Yeah, I like the meetings we had.  It was like, yeah, well, it's got to be unobtrusive.  And we really got to kind of get it in there and get it over with so we can continue with  the show.  I think we even said, look, we're willing to, you know, kill about two or three minutes 
[01:29:00]  every morning on the bit.  We talked for three hours on this side, so like two or three minutes, fine.  We'll promote it.  We'll play the clip.  We'll take the winner.  Two or three minutes tops.  But we get so...  Now it's completely taking over our lives.  We get so into things.  Logan in Delaware, how are you, buddy?  Pretty good.  How you doing, man?  Hey.  Good.  Why are you calling the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, I just wanted to say I'm sitting in a warehouse and I'm listening to you guys  every morning from a ham radio.  Oh, thank you, sir. 
[01:29:30]  I have a radio from like 1976 from Radio Shack.  That's all I get out here.  It's the only station I get.  What is a ham radio?  Ham radio.  No, it's a big ham with an antenna.  That's the first thing I thought of, believe me.  Isn't that what you'd think of?  Just a big, slimy piece of ham?  Just Bob Kelly with an antenna sticking out of him.  Stupid Bob Kelly.  God, I was so aggravated.  Hold on, Logan.  We don't really care much about what you have to say. 
[01:30:00]  Or you personally.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Go ahead, Ant.  Stupid Bob Kelly.  Got married online.  Yeah.  And it was like we would watch him and his fiancee get married on the computer because he's  in Hawaii.  He's in Maui.  He's in Hawaii.  He sent out a bunch of invitations to join him in his wedding.  And it's like, wow, Maui.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I got the same invite.  I started getting excited.  I'm like, oh, my God.  I'm going to Hawaii for a wedding.  Maui.  This is awesome.  No.  His invitation had a website on it. 
[01:30:30]  You go to the website and you supposedly get to watch the wedding, the nuptials on  the beach on the Internet.  You know, a little streaming video of his wedding.  So I go there and I couldn't get on.  I couldn't.  If there was no link, I was supposed to be emailed something.  I got emailed the thing.  But all I was emailed was something that gave you a link to a video to make sure that your 
[01:31:00]  computer could handle the video.  And then after that, I couldn't find any video, any links, anything to click on to bring  up his video.  It was it was really nice, especially when the guy doing the ceremony said, do you, Colonel  Kurtz, take this woman?  His fiancee, Dawn, looked really, really great.  It was on the beach.  It was just him and Dawn and the the guy who does the wedding.  I don't know what they're called in Hawaii.  Yeah.  Oh, Hawaii.  We get it.  Hawaii.  They say.  It's the shoeless man doing the ceremony. 
[01:31:30]  But it was pretty nice.  And I couldn't hear as well.  Because I watched it at the Comedy Cellar.  And all you could hear is DePaulo and just stupid Colin firing out vicious lines at Bob.  But it was very nice.  Oh, God.  They read their vows to each other.  And I could see Bob dabbing away at his eyes.  Oh, he gets very emotional.  He is an emotional wreck.  But I unfortunately couldn't hear whatever probably poorly written vows he said.  I'm sure hers were flowery and lovely.  Oh, his is probably some kind of like. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  I'm sure there's a poem with roses are red, violets are blue in it.  Yeah.  Roses are red, violets are brew.  Violets are brew.  Violets are brew.  Oh, I should just eat with shotgun bless.  Don't call.  Don't call.  That's for tomorrow.  Between 7 and 7.30.  $1,000, yes.  Let's say hi to Mike before we take a break here.  Mike in Florida.  Mike.  Yo, guys.  What's up? 
[01:32:30]  I am a long-time listener.  First-time caller.  Yeah.  That's a joke.  Listen.  Listen, I've been listening to you guys since AEW moved down here from Long Island.  Good old Long Island.  And I'll tell you, if they lose you down here, it's really going to suck.  Because the state of Florida sucks as it is anyway.  It's kind of too bad.  West Palm Beach doesn't really want this radio show.  It's unfortunate.  They're looking for another show, and that's the only reason we're still on the air.  And I think after a year and a half, we finally have hit our stride. 
[01:33:00]  So I don't know why they would get rid of it now.  If they yank us off, dude, if they yank us off, just get an XM and listen to us that  way.  What can I tell you?  Yeah, what can we say?  If we want to stay on that station, if they yank us off, just do that.  You can hear us that way.  There you go.  Well, I'm actually moving back to New York because the state itself is a bunch of Bible  huggers, and that's exactly why everyone down here has no sense of personality, no sense  of humor.  And a tree hugger? 
[01:33:30]  I think it is, right?  And everyone...  Bible thumper.  Yes, it's a Bible...  Oh, sorry.  We're just commenting on your stupidity.  I know.  And especially since they're all Jews down there, so they're basically Bible deniers.  At least the newer part, I guess.  Exactly.  It's a Bible thumper.  When are you moving back?  Hopefully soon.  Hopefully within the next...  Hopefully soon.  That really narrows it down.  Why?  Going to give them a room there, Jim?  Wait on some...  We have a hat down here.  Don't care.  Don't know.  Don't care. 
[01:34:00]  I was just curious.  I mean, this guy's weird.  Were you really curious?  I was, actually.  I don't think you cared, really.  What kind of work do you do?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What do you do?  I am curious as to what you do.  What do you do that you would then come up here and be able to get a job?  I work for one of the cable companies down here.  Oh, well.  Cool.  Not so much fun.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I love stupid, ow-tasered, college douche. 
[01:34:30]  Speaking of being unobtrusive...  Don't taste me, bro.  Yes?  Speaking of being unobtrusive, like we're being with this contest of ours.  Hey, before we take a break, we have Marc Maron coming in a little after the break.  Yes.  Yeah, I just have a feeling to talk about crap you might be having lying around your  apartment that you have and stuff. 
[01:35:00]  Huh?  Most of it's crap, but you might have gold or, I don't know, jewelry laying around.  People do.  They got old jewelry laying around the house.  What are you going to do with it, though?  Look, this read has two days left, so now I can read an instant feedback that really made  me laugh.  Yeah.  The guy goes, okay, yeah, let me get this straight.  You guys want me to just take my golden jewelry and throw it in an envelope and just send it  off, and they're going to send me money.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  People are pessimists, but they do send you money. 
[01:35:30]  Of course they do.  You think a place that's staying in business that just took your jewelry?  Maybe it's good that we're mentioning that, because you don't have to worry, but I guess  if you just listen in that way, it is kind of strange.  Because it's not just like you're putting it in an envelope.  You will receive a, what is it called?  Cash?  No, the package you put it in.  I don't know.  Package?  Oh, a jewelry shipping package thing.  No.  Oh, a manila envelope?  No, it is called... 
[01:36:00]  Or is it vanilla?  Yes.  Vanilla.  It is called your request a pack.  Oh, yeah.  Once your golden jewelry arrives at their facility, your money goes out 24 hours later.  Yeah.  See, that's what you do.  With requestapack.com.  Yeah, you request...  No!  What?  It's cash4gold.com.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Or you could go to iliketurtles.com, right?  No.  What?  No, this is an opportunity to clean out your house, get rid of the garbage, and pick up 
[01:36:30]  some quick cash with cash4gold.com.  It's easy.  You get the request a pack, you send your jewelry in, and then you get 24 hours later, you're  getting cash.  Then you could call them, right?  You can call them.  Yeah.  The number's easy.  It's 877-G-O-L-D-G-O-L-D-5-90.  590.  877-G-O-L-D-5-90.  See, it's easy.  Hey, CokeLogic writes, mugged an old white bitch, we got a website for you. 
[01:37:00]  No?  No.  They don't want stolen goods.  They want your old jewelry that you're not using anymore.  Don't you understand?  And if you use the promo code virus, you pick up an extra 2.5% value on the jewelry that  you send in the request a pack envelope.  Oh, okay.  The money's sent out 24 hours later.  Really?  Yeah, they just sit on it for 24 hours.  This is a good thing.  I haven't heard about this.  Of course it is.  I hope we talk about this tomorrow. 
[01:37:30]  Sure we will.  All right.  Mark Maron next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I think we got your mother on the phone in.  If this is...  Oh, boy.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Who is this?  This is Ro. 
[01:38:00]  This is not your Anthony's mother.  Of course not.  My Anthony works for Ron and Fez.  Oh.  And you're calling why?  Well, I want to know if I could enter the contest.  Hmm.  What contest?  Tomorrow.  The turtle contest?  Well, the turtle contest was today.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you're not having it again?  No, no.  We're not having the turtle contest tomorrow.  We play another clip today. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God.  Now it's known as...  And if you hear it tomorrow...  Now it's known as the turtle contest.  It's the turtle contest.  And you guys thought we were joking about people being stupid.  It's called...  It's just...  You win a thousand dollars contest.  But you have to listen for a sound that we play the day before.  See, now tomorrow, between 7 and 7.30...  Oh, do you have the sound?  Here it is.  Unfortunately.  Do you hear that awful part of a song parody? 
[01:39:00]  Yes, I do.  Yeah.  When you hear that between 7 and 7.30...  Tomorrow.  You call in.  Yes.  And if the billion to one odds are with you and you are the 10th caller, we'll give you  a thousand dollars.  Yeah.  All right?  There's no entering.  You just got to listen to the Opie and Anthony.  It's not the turtle contest.  And who's...  You know what I'm doing?  Who's Anthony with Ron and Fez? 
[01:39:30]  Pits.  Oh, see, we know him as Pitsy.  Yeah.  Which one's Pitsy?  By the way, he's an employee, but I don't think he's...  Friends and family.  But he's friends of the show somehow.  Yeah.  No, you can win.  Just let her win.  Who gives a crap?  She'll never get through it.  And by the way, now that it's known as the turtle contest, oh, between 7 and 7.30 tomorrow,  you will hear, I like turtles.  I like turtles.  And people will call up like crazy trying to win.  All right.  Thank you, Pitsy's mom. 
[01:40:00]  Thanks a lot.  Have a good day.  Goodbye, madam.  We got a very funny comedian in studio and we're wasting time with you.  I don't know what's wrong with us.  Pitsy's going to be mad at you.  You're dissing his mom.  Well, I think he would, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Unless he's still...  Moms are kind of off limits.  Unless you're really good friends with somebody, then you could call, you know, their mom  a whore.  Unless your mom lives in the attic and tries to kill herself, then, you know.  Oh, Jesus.  Anyway, Mark Maron's in studio. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  Oh, thank God.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  Let me take my nicotine gum out of my mouth.  Oh, you got that going for yourself there, trying to quit?  Trying to quit?  I haven't smoked a cigarette in seven years.  That's a pathetic part of it.  He's still chewing the gum.  Have you been on the gum for seven years?  Oh, no.  I don't know what the hell happened, man.  I haven't been smoking cigarettes in seven years, and then at some point, I picked up  a cigar like Colin, you know.  I'm like, I didn't smoke cigars.  And then I'm like, I'm smoking four a day, and my entire life is built around cigars.  And then where are they?  How do I get them?  How do I get more?  I got things coming in the mail bundles. 
[01:41:00]  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  So now I'm on nicotine gum again, like 20 pieces a day to get off the cigars.  I don't know what to do with it.  Just so I feel better.  I don't know.  I'm just putting things in my mouth to feel better.  What does the nicotine gum do?  It just fills you up with nicotine.  It's beautiful.  I'm lit up right now because of gum, and now they've got it in flavors.  I'm all set.  Flavored nicotine gum?  Yeah.  Yeah, if I had an IV unit with nicotine, I would roll in here with it.  See, you know what it is, though?  I don't think the nicotine was why I smoked.  I just enjoyed the whole ritual of smoking. 
[01:41:30]  Of searing your lung tissue with hot smoke?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, that's a good feeling when you wake up and you're like,  your lungs aren't supposed to make that noise.  Yeah, whistle.  I'll just burn through it with a cigarette.  Then I'll feel better.  Just plow through it with some hot smoke.  Blast through the blockage and start anew.  Yeah, you've got to just burn off the fog that's in your lungs.  Right, and it feels like you're actually doing something.  You look forward to it, man.  I mean, when I smoked, I used to get up.  I'd have like a triple espresso.  I had like four cigarettes, and my body would just deplete all its energy, 
[01:42:00]  processing toxins.  I'd have to go to bed again.  Literally, I was exhausted.  I was sweating and exhausted after five minutes.  Yeah.  It was always about like having a cigarette, though, and a drink or something.  Cigarette a drink.  Cigarette lunch.  After eating.  Cigarette sex.  Something like that.  Cigarette and driving.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, cigarette.  But I think it was more than, it's not something gum could take the place of.  Really, with me, it became this thing where, you know, and I used to do drugs,  so I know what the commitment to it is.  Yeah.  And I feel, like I feel bad, honestly, for people who've never been addicted to anything, 
[01:42:30]  because they're the real losers.  Because on some level, they just don't know what it's really like to want something,  you know, and get it again and again and again until they're sick and have to stop.  That's passion.  I didn't quit doing drugs because I didn't enjoy them.  I quit because I couldn't handle the commitment.  So what happened was, is that these cigars, I didn't realize what was happening, because  I'm not a cigar snob.  I don't care.  I'd smoke them alone.  I don't care if anyone sees me.  And I'm just sitting there in my own house, plowing through these cigars, and I realized  like this is an hour of just, you know, nicotine distribution. 
[01:43:00]  You could sit there for an hour, and you just become like a nicotine sponge.  So it wasn't even the oral thing or anything else.  It was just like, I need this stuff in my body at all times.  And the gum is the way to go right now.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I was inhaling the cigars.  You feel disgusting.  My hands.  Wow, you were inhaling the cigars?  A little bit.  My hands were getting numb.  I was having chest pains.  I'm like, is this how I want to go out?  Really?  Is this how I want to go out with a cigar in my mouth?  I want to be that guy?  And you rationalize it, though, you know, Jim?  Because you're thinking like, hey, Milton Berle smoked cigars his whole life. 
[01:43:30]  So I'm like Milton Berle.  He's still alive.  He lived in 90.  You always find that one guy who out-survived everybody in your barometer.  And that's going to be the benchmark.  Exactly.  That's my guy.  Milton Berle.  If you have to follow a guy, you might as well, you know, pick someone like that.  Yeah, exactly.  That's not the guy that had his jawbone cut off at 22 years old.  So what's the fault of my guy?  I don't want to hear about it.  Hacks on it all.  That's what was killing me.  I was sitting there going, I think my jaw is a little sore.  I think I did it.  I think it's over.  Oh, you got it.  It's not like opening my mouth, looking for purple spots. 
[01:44:00]  It's ridiculous.  How long have you been on the cigars?  I was not.  Why?  You think it's over?  You think I'm done?  Colin was going through them nonstop.  I remember when he was on that, and then I got into that situation.  Because when you got heads like ours, you got this idea that like, I'll just smoke one  on Saturday.  And then two days later, you're smoking five.  And I don't know how the hell it happened.  As I'm listening to Mark talk, I haven't smoked in five years.  You want to smoke?  Dude, I'm dying for a cigarette right now.  No, don't even think about it.  No, I won't touch the nicotine.  It'll pass.  But I'm just saying, listening to somebody describe the Jones, he's describing it like it's a bad 
[01:44:30]  thing, because it is.  Yeah.  But it's like, I'm such a sicko.  I'm like, God, I would love a cigarette right now.  You know, it's like your soul is itching.  Like something, you're inside your body, like scratching at your skin.  And the only thing that's going to make it better is a cigar or a cigarette.  But the gum will work for now.  I'll figure out something else.  Hey, now, we were catching up.  We haven't had you on the show in a while.  And I was thinking to myself, why haven't we had Mark Maron on the show?  You're hilarious.  And you're playing comics here in New York this weekend.  And we were catching up a little bit. 
[01:45:00]  And you said that your wife left you.  Oh, well, what happened was she brought it to my attention that I have an anger problem.  But she said it differently.  She said, I'm leaving.  Wow.  And she, you know, let me tell you.  Now, is that why you're smoking the cigars?  Dude, it's, well, right now.  Is it all related?  No, no.  It was before that.  I don't, this is the weird thing.  It's like when that happens after a few months, I'm looking at Jim.  And I'm like, yeah, I don't care.  I'm over it.  It's been a few months.  And then when you see anybody that might know you. 
[01:45:30]  Have you seen her?  Was she saying anything?  Oh, Jesus.  I don't know where she is.  I don't know what she's doing.  But I'll tell you, man, I have never been hit that hard.  I've never been, like, I'm almost grateful to be, you know, honestly heartbroken.  Because I need a new hour.  And, you know, and I got about 45 now and it's looking good.  So whoever's expecting politics in comics, forget it.  It's going to be borderline, it's going to be rational misogyny, I think is what it's going to be.  You've been very introspective as a comic.  Mark is not just political. 
[01:46:00]  You talk a lot about your own dysfunction, which I always like about you.  Your own psychosis.  Well, that was a misunderstanding, you know.  I mean, I was never really a political comic.  Because, you know, when you talk about that, when someone says he's a political comic, you're like, well, I think I'll watch TV then.  Because what is it?  Political comic is a guy who does one-liners about things that people barely care about.  I mean, always pretty broad, you know, comic.  But, yeah, so she takes off.  I didn't see it coming.  You know, I was deeply in love with this person and it was brutal.  There was no hint there was problems in your marriage? 
[01:46:30]  Well, apparently she knew.  I mean, obviously.  But you had no idea and this came out of the blue?  Well, look, you know, it's like, okay, so I got a, you know, I'm a little angry.  Sometimes I wake up angry.  What are you going to do?  I mean, I don't know.  And it got out of hand.  I'm not going to take that away from it.  You know, I do have a little bit of a rage issue.  Yeah, but over time I thought we were working on it.  We were going to couples counseling.  Let me, I'll be honest with you.  If you're in couples counseling and you're a guy, that is basically an ambush that you pay for.  You have to say, you are paying somebody to sit there and witness your wife call you an ass over and over again. 
[01:47:00]  And for you to go, I know.  I know.  I know.  And you just have to take it?  Well, yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  We could spend this money better.  Let's go to a dominatrix.  You know, she can do me with a strap on.  You can watch it.  Who knows, maybe I'll learn something about myself and we can broaden our sexual horizons.  But no, we've got to waste money on this old Jewish lady.  We go to this lady who's supposed to be an anger person.  And this woman who I'm seeing, that's the racket, too.  It's like, we're going together.  She bolts.  And then all of a sudden the therapist is like, well, I was on your side anyways. 
[01:47:30]  Why don't you keep coming?  Oh, I get how this works.  Oh, okay.  So this woman, she's in her 60s.  She can't hear well.  So now I go in.  It's ridiculous.  I go in there and I'm like, and, you know, I think I'm feeling a little sadness today.  She's like, why?  I'm like, I feel a little sadness.  I don't know.  You're glad?  What are you glad about?  I'm sad.  Why are you sad?  Why are you yelling at me?  Why are you yelling at me?  My mother yelled at me and you're yelling at me.  And she's like, see, I think we made some progress.  Mark, were you guys, because I had the same problem, man, with the anger. 
[01:48:00]  It's like, were you yelling at her?  Or was it just like she would watch you raging at other people and go, you're a psychopath?  Well, here's the thing, though, Jim.  It doesn't, you know, after a certain point, you know, look, I believe, and I believe this  for a while, if you want to get honest about it, that if you're ever yelling at a woman,  all right, if you're ever yelling at a woman, and, you know, if you're a rage guy, you know  what it means.  You feel it coming and you're like, don't do it.  It's not that important that she didn't move the pencil, you know what I mean, that whatever 
[01:48:30]  the hell you're about to lose it about, and you feel it happen, and you're in it, man.  It's like drugs.  It's like anything else.  And you're just like, you're in it.  You can't think about it.  And, you know, there's no happiness until she's crying, and it's bad.  Jesus Christ.  There's no happiness until she's crying.  Do you ever avoid her apology because you're like, I like the anger so much sometimes.  Like, you want to keep the anger.  She tries to say sorry.  You're like, I don't want to hear it.  I want to be mad.  But it's not that.  It's because you don't believe her.  You know, you don't believe it that when they're apologizing, like, well, why'd you do that?  I think generally you feel like you've been disrespected somehow if you're yelling at them. 
[01:49:00]  I would yell at her or to her or, you know, but it wasn't.  The thing was is I was working hard on it, and I really, what I was going to say is I  believe that if you're ever yelling at a woman 99% of the time, all you should be saying  is, why can't you be my mommy?  Why?  Why can't you be my mommy?  Why aren't you my mommy?  You know, so if you just say that instead, maybe it'll disarm it a little bit and we can understand  what's going on.  But ultimately what happened is even though, you know, we were working it out or I was  trying to work on it, that she had filled with my bile and she'd gotten enough resentment 
[01:49:30]  to make a case against me.  And when she saw her opportunity, she took off.  And it's awful when someone leaves because you realize there's no way to leave.  There's no way to do it gracefully.  You know, if you're going to leave, you leave.  It's like one day I get home.  She picks me up from the airport.  She says, I love you.  She takes me home.  She says, I'm leaving.  And, you know, she's, and she leaves.  And there's, how else is she going to do it?  Wait, she dropped, she took you, you came back from a gig or something.  She took you home?  Yeah, I've been away for a week.  Took me home and, uh.  Came in the house with you or just dropped you off?  Yeah, yeah, no.  Came in the house.  You know, she's like, how was everything?  Everything was.  Was all our stuff packed and ready to go?  No, nothing, man. 
[01:50:00]  You know, and she just says, I think I want a trial separation.  What does that mean?  And I'm like, really?  What the hell is that?  You know, she's like, yeah.  And then she just walks out the door, right?  And I'm like, well, what am I supposed to do?  But she said, it was a classic.  She goes, well, maybe you should call somebody.  Oh, I don't mean to laugh.  No, no, no.  It's all right.  I want people to laugh directly at my pain.  I'm cutting out the middle part, the joke.  I think jokes are for wussies.  I'll just open my heart and why don't you just pee in it? 
[01:50:30]  That's all.  I think you should call somebody.  That's kind of funny.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  That's why I'm here.  That's brutal.  It's brutal, but also funny.  Yes.  I want to see how Mark handles this because, believe me, I'm next.  So I want to know exactly what you're doing so what happens to me.  I'll tell you, man.  When we go over, if we wait until we go over to XM so we can talk about it like men,  you know, I'll do it.  With all the curse words that are up.  Because I'm making some mistakes, you know, and I didn't handle it well. 
[01:51:00]  And the arc of this thing has been profound because, I'll be honest with you, I've not  been, I don't know if I've ever been in love with somebody, you know, deeply.  Because this thing was like, this was a gut punch.  Because the horrible thing you realize when this happens is like, wait, I don't have complete  control over her?  I don't, you know, you don't, you can't stop it.  It's out of your hands.  That's it.  That's really what it's all about.  How long were you together?  Eight years.  Eight years.  Married.  Granted, when I met her, I was married and drunk.  But, you know, I was kind of doomed for the beginning, but she did get me sober. 
[01:51:30]  And, you know, it's all right.  Wow.  Oh, so here's the thing.  Like, you can't, you can't, there's only one way to leave somebody.  What was she going to do?  What was she going to, like, lead up to?  Like, two weeks.  Give two weeks notice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You get the memo?  I'm going to give you two weeks notice, and then, what about our stuff?  It's still sitting in there.  I've got a museum of her in my house.  And I don't, you know.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, I remember this one. 
[01:52:00]  Let's look at this exhibit.  Well, yeah, at least it's not like Ed Gein.  She's not sitting in there dead.  Yeah, yeah.  You just yell at us.  Oh, this is my wife.  Yeah, yeah.  Is this Ed?  Oh, man.  But I guess I got to get this stuff out of the house, because it doesn't look like it's  coming back around.  I was holding on to her for a while.  How long has it been?  Well, it was, we did the three months, and then I ended up filing for divorce, because  you know, you don't want to, it got, it just, you don't want to.  You got to do it first.  Well, it wasn't even a matter, it wasn't even a matter of being petty.  It was just that she was unwilling to decide. 
[01:52:30]  Like, she needed, she needed to do this for her.  She needed, you know, she felt overwhelmed.  I got it.  There's part of me, and that's the thing, when you're like, when you're like us, you  know, when somebody leaves, there was part of me that, you know, I was angry, but  there was part of me that was like, well, good for her.  You know what I mean?  That took a lot of guts, and I've been trying to leave me for years.  But apparently, it's just that simple, you walk out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, yeah, I can't.  I'm like, I'm trying, you know.  But, so it's been, at three months, she still didn't want to, she didn't know, and I was  starting to drift.  You know, so what am I going to do?  Just sit here and live in relation to her indecision, and wait until she's. 
[01:53:00]  Would you guys talk and stuff on the phone?  Yeah, we tried.  She didn't want to, but I did, and I was trying to be cool, and you know, I was trying to  sort of give her her space.  But, you know, it's very hard when you're desperate and in pain.  And you're worried about what they're doing, who they're talking to.  Well, I mean, I wasn't too worried about that once I got past, once I really believed that  it wasn't another guy.  I just don't think it was.  And, you know, and after I followed her around for four days, I just, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.  I didn't do that.  I didn't do that.  But it wasn't about that.  She, you know, she, what happened was she got a book deal. 
[01:53:30]  She's writing a book.  You know, she got some bread, and she was unhappy.  She saw her window.  She got out, you know, so she had a buffer, you know, so, and that's, and that was it.  I'm trying to be a mensch about it, but some days are better than others, and when we get  over to XM, I'll share.  All right, cool.  Listen.  I'll say, the comics this weekend, that's a great time to see a comedian right after he's  been left.  That is a damn good time.  I didn't see a comic.  And it's interesting that people think you're a political comic.  I mean, your political stuff is really, really good, but, I mean, you're, you talk about 
[01:54:00]  everything, man.  Yeah, no, I always do.  Your technology stuff always makes me laugh.  You did a whole ringtone bit when I saw you at the Comedy Cellar, and I left my ass off.  Yeah, I've always been that.  It's just that when I did the work on Air America, you know, you get lumped in.  That's why you got labeled.  That's right.  Okay, I remember you used to be over there.  Right, and then you start to, and then people start to expect it, and I got fans that are  like that, but I've always been pretty broad.  Yeah, you're definitely a broad comic.  I just want to get that word out there.  You're going to see a real funny guy if you go to comics this weekend.  What, tomorrow and Saturday?  Two shows, both days? 
[01:54:30]  That's right.  Friday and Saturday.  And comics is a great club.  We were there the other day for the Bob Newhart thing, and it was terrific.  212-524-2500 for tickets, and if you, what, use promo code MMRADIO?  MMRADIO, the 25% off.  Oh, MM would be for Mark Maron.  Okay, promo code MMRADIO.  Well, where do you throw that promo code in the ticket?  I guess you call it.  The ticket, ladies' face?  MMRADIO!  All right, all right!  You got it.  Right.  Comicsny.com is a website. 
[01:55:00]  Maybe it's there.  I don't know, but either way, it's a great show, man.  Mark has got some thought starters here.  Mark Maron, Scotland, Surveillance, Patriot Act.  Got a lot of stuff.  And something I've been saying for a long time on this radio show.  The Chinese are coming.  Mark agrees with it.  Well, here's the deal.  We're going to do it after the break.  That was a big tease.  Oh, a little tease.  That was a big tease.  More with Mark Maron.  It's Opie and Anthony.  All right, we have an old friend stopping by today, Mark Maron.  Haven't seen him in a while.  Oh, I'm so happy to be here. 
[01:55:30]  It's Opie and Anthony, of course.  Mark Maron will be at Comics here in New York City tomorrow night and Saturday.  I personally recommend you see Mark Maron.  Really, really funny comic.  Yeah.  A thinking man's comic at times.  Yeah, and I need help.  And he needs help.  Apparently.  This is a weird thing now where I don't mind, given the state I'm in.  Sometimes audiences leave, and I like it when they walk out and say,  that guy was hilarious.  I really had a good time.  But I'm okay with them walking out going, you know, I hope that guy's okay. 
[01:56:00]  I hope he's good.  And all of a sudden you're talking more about your breakup,  and I thought I was listening to my pal Anthony because, wow.  Oh, my God.  I guess it's similar no matter who goes through a divorce.  Because, yeah, I heard you talking about the whole thing.  When finances are involved and lawyers get involved and stuff,  it just gets so long and ugly and just there's no justice in it. 
[01:56:30]  Well, that's it.  And California's a 50-50 state, and I don't really know where we are with it,  and I don't have that much bread.  You know, I just don't.  I'm not some sort of superstar.  She knows what we went through.  I know what we went through.  She always felt, like, bad that she didn't work more, bring more money in.  And I never had a big problem with it.  And now she made some bread, and she found her window.  And there's part of me that's sort of like, well, walk away.  You know, I mean, be big about this.  You left me.  Walk away.  Just walk away.  Do the right thing. 
[01:57:00]  Just walk away.  Well, there's something to it.  But, you know, she's entitled to it legally, so why would she not take it on some level?  But, again, I don't have that much bread.  And the root of this, really, as I was telling Jim, is that she got overwhelmed by my personality,  my negativity, my cynicism.  Like, even if you're not yelling or even if you're having a good day,  you're still a little â€“ you're kind of like a negativity sprinkler.  Or you just emanate it like a negativity humidifier sitting there on the couch.  And they walk into this environment, and she'd had enough of it. 
[01:57:30]  And, okay, so I get that.  So she takes off, and she wants to be independent.  I just don't understand why do I have to finance that project.  Yeah.  You know, given that she's got a few bucks.  But I guess that's something that all men go through with this,  and you just got to accept it and try not to hate all women.  God bless you for just sitting there saying you just got to accept it  because we could take phone calls for the next four hours of guys that are having a problem accepting it.  Well, I don't know what California law is as far â€“  is it 50-50 based on what you have at that moment? 
[01:58:00]  It's 50-50 of what you acquired during the marriage.  Like, if it's not before the marriage, then that's not on the table.  And the only reason I'm saying that I accept it on some level â€“  don't think I don't have these waves of anger and sadness â€“  is that, first of all, I have no choice but to accept it because knowing me, if I let it eat me up,  then I'm going to have a resentment that's going to dig into my heart,  and it's going to stay there for God knows how long.  And on the other side of that, I know I was an ass.  I mean, I'm not in the dark about how much of a douche I've been. 
[01:58:30]  I mean, I'm not trying to deny that.  I'm not a complete victim here.  I did have some part in this thing.  But, you know, that's the thing, Jim, is that when you have the anger thing,  when you're done being angry, there's that right after you're like,  okay, are we good?  You know what I mean?  You could sit there and scream and yell and rage and accidentally break a chair.  It was an accident, I swear.  And then right after you're done, if they're upset and they're freaked out,  you know, when you're a guy who rages, right after you're done, you're like,  I feel better.  Do you want to have something to eat? 
[01:59:00]  And they're like, no.  No, I'm a mess.  If you get the emotional, like, kind of hangover,  they're going to have three days from now or a day from now because of what we do.  Yeah.  And you go through cycles like that, which is, I think, one of the big problems with her  is that she said this happens over and over again.  You say you're going to do something about it, you don't do something about it,  and then we're back in this.  And I'm like, well, what do you mean?  And then if you think about it, you're like, oh, crap.  You know what I mean?  Maybe she's right.  You know, I realize that I'm only dating a girl for a while.  I'm not married, but I'm 75% of the problem.  And I know I am.  Yeah.  I know it. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  She's not perfect.  Yeah.  She's a boob.  But, I mean, I am 75% of the problem.  That probably means you're 85% of the problem, by the way.  I mean, it's got to be said.  But when you're like us, though, I mean, I have an inner Jim Norton somewhere in there  that doesn't have the courage to put myself through whatever the hell it is that you do.  But the thing is, is that if you have that insecurity or if you beat up on yourself by  nature, you're going to shoulder the whole burden immediately.  Like, when she left, I'm like, oh, it's all me.  I'm going to go hook myself up to a box that's going to fix me. 
[02:00:00]  You know, it's almost like you've got cancer.  It's like, could somebody lobotomize me?  Could you disconnect this thing that ruined my life?  Can you help me out?  And then as time goes on, you're like, wait a minute.  She's sitting here.  She's been here for eight years.  It's got to be feeding something.  You know, I wasn't holding her hostage except for that once.  But thank God she didn't call the cops because that could really hurt me in court.  But it is a 50-50 thing.  You know that.  It's not 75%.  It's got to go both ways because why the hell is she sitting there?  She's probably working out childhood demons through me. 
[02:00:30]  I mean, I'm sure I remind her of somebody awful and she's just trying to fix it.  Believe me, I'm her lamb that she ran with.  She's trying to work something out.  Well, that's what happens.  Starts hearing the crying.  I've never heard it put that way before.  I like that.  Well, that's what happens.  I find that the women that I've attracted in my life, they're cute.  They're sexy.  They're charming.  They're cutting.  They're funny.  And deep down, they resent every member of our gender.  That there's some part.  And the problem with women, really, all women, I think, is that they all have fathers. 
[02:01:00]  And at some point, whatever they didn't do or whatever they did do, to whatever extreme it was, men are going to pay for it in their lives.  And I'm just that guy.  I'll look into somebody's eyes and I'll just see this hurricane.  And I'm like, I'm going in.  There are Barbie parts flying around, camp counselors, missed rides.  You know what I mean?  And I'm just sitting there going, where's the broken daddy box? 
[02:01:30]  Where's the broken daddy box?  I'll hook directly into it and I'll just hold on.  You know, it's so true, man.  I have made a career in my relationships over my whole life going out with girls that just didn't have fathers.  They left for some reason during their life at some point and those are the girls I've always somehow connected with. 
[02:02:00]  I had a couple of those, too, man.  I'm not even talking a couple.  I'm talking every single one of them.  It's a continuum.  It's just, yeah, there's just, not every single one.  Like when I was younger, of course, just basically, you know, high school stuff.  Of course, some of them had fathers then, but I'm sure they eventually left the family.  But then you have that moment where they do that slip and it'll always happen.  It's, you know, once or twice in your relationship, they'll do the like, hey, dad, I mean, Mark.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Awkward. 
[02:02:30]  What was really awkward for me is that my wife called me daddy outside of the bedroom.  And I knew, I knew that that was going to be an issue at some point.  I was always a little uncomfortable with it.  Never in the bedroom, always outside of the bedroom.  Hey, Mark.  It's worse than they call you a father.  Father.  Changing gears slightly here because you really wanted to talk about the Chinese are coming  or the Patriots Act or surveillance.  There was a bunch of things you were trying to get off your chest here.  Well, I need to learn Chinese.  Patriots Act. 
[02:03:00]  That's why you can't film a team from the sideline.  There you go.  I need to learn Chinese because it's now the biggest mark in the world.  I know the future is Chinese.  There's a lot of freaks out there that think it's going to be Mexican.  I mean, you watch Lou Dobbs.  You'd think he was doing a show from the Alamo.  But it is Chinese.  And I, you know, I've become fascinated with Chinese people recently because I really don't  know anything about them.  I don't know anything.  I mean, I just don't know anything.  They've been here longer than most.  Very mysterious.  Yeah.  They've been here longer than most ethnic groups.  When was the last time you sat down with a Chinese guy and just said, probably never.  What is going on?  I think they're ever.  What's going on? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  You know, and I go to Chinatown, I'm fascinated with their food.  You ever go down to Chinatown and just spend an hour walking down the street going, what  the hell is this?  What is that?  Is that a rock?  Is that a bug?  Is that a root?  What?  Is that moss?  I think it's a dried clam.  What the hell is that?  How do they use that?  What is that going?  Are we eating that?  I mean, I wonder how many times Chinese grocers have to see like, you know, white guys holding  things up going, dude, what is that?  Eat it.  You're high.  Come on, eat it.  You think it's a cleaning product?  It's dessert?  Yeah, exactly.  It's that gelatinous stuff.  But this isn't about food.  It's about the future.  And I think what you're talking about is if you look at it forever. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  If you look at the paper.  It's slowly but surely coming.  Yeah.  Most of our national debt is to China.  They own this country on paper.  The best I can figure it, we are outsourced Chinese labor in this country.  And our job is, I think, to eat and buy things.  And the other thing is, is that I think that the future is Chinese environmentally.  Because if you read the reports, if global warming continues at its current pace, all  that's going to be left in the ocean is prehistoric toxic algae and mutant jellyfish.  And if you think about it, the Chinese are really the only culture that knows how to  prepare that stuff.  They try to eat that. 
[02:04:30]  So I'm saying get a new cookbook, learn a few key phrases, get ready for the new bosses.  Yeah, they do own this country.  Oh, yeah.  They're holding on to more of our money, more of our cash.  We got no money.  This is a complete debt-run economy.  All we manufacture here is need.  That's all we manufacture.  It's like, we don't manufacture-  Yeah, you flew by that thought.  It was pretty interesting that our job in America is to eat and buy stuff.  That's it.  That's it.  And they manufacture, they try to exploit our desires.  Basically, advertising industry, their job is to desire farm. 
[02:05:00]  They're farming our desires to give us new ones that we don't need.  You got everything you need.  What do you need?  You need toilet paper, some food, and maybe what?  What else?  That's about it.  You don't even need toilet paper.  So all you need is food and a house.  You don't need all the other crap.  So all they're doing is, and that's why I think there's never going to be national health  care.  Because really, the economy needs the turnover.  If poor people, if they can't afford to be part of it, if they can't afford to be part  of it, we'll die.  You're going to die, yeah.  We don't need you. 
[02:05:30]  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you going to do?  Adapt or die?  That's like a lotto.  Right.  Sorry.  Logan's run.  Should have kept up.  It's all about consumers.  And I have more thoughts on it.  But the thing about, oh, God, what the hell just happened to my train of thought?  Breathe, breathe, breathe.  Make a faint gum.  Go ahead.  Grab another piece.  Well, I was in Scotland.  Scotland, okay.  I'm in Scotland.  Well, this is what made me worry.  Were we talking about the Chinese, though?  What happened?  Right.  And we're going to follow the thought.  Worldwide.  We're going worldwide now.  I'm in Scotland. 
[02:06:00]  Worst month of my life.  I go to the Fringe Festival, and I'm performing for people that don't like Americans.  I didn't realize that there were 900 shows going on every night, so I'm drawing audiences  of 12.  So I go to Scotland to perform for 12 people for 28 days.  And I've got to be honest with you.  I'm critical of this country, but I've never been more patriotic in my life because I resented  these provincial alcoholic dummies.  I mean, no one has given them the memo that, one, alcoholism is a disease, not a way of life.  And, two, that, hey, maybe you shouldn't have a piece of pig and butter with every 
[02:06:30]  meal.  With every meal, you've got to have pig and butter.  I mean, a full English breakfast in this country is an attempted suicide.  Now, so, and if I heard one more time in the UK, they're like, Americans don't understand  irony.  And I'm like, what are you talking about?  I'm an intelligent person.  I live in the United States.  My entire existence is ironic.  Now, but getting back to the food thing, this is where it's coming around, is they eat  this crap.  I mean, the things they eat in this country would frighten people, would frighten people.  And there's not a lot of obese people in Scotland.  And I'm thinking, how the hell is this possible? 
[02:07:00]  How does that work?  Well, I realize that apparently in other countries, in between meals, they stop eating, which is  just unheard of here.  I mean, that's part of our freedom.  You've got to spare a moment, shove something in your mouth.  They're going to change the slogan of the United States from America, land of the free, home  of the brave to America, all you can eat.  Step up to the buffet.  Quick, get some food between you and your feelings before they lead to questions.  God damn, that is so frigging right on the mark.  It is the eating, in between eating. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  When I leave my house, it looks like I'm going on a camping trip.  And I'm just going across town.  If I'm at the hotel and I've got to get on the subway, I'm like, I need an apple, some  water.  A power bar.  Yeah, tent.  Where's my tent?  You just really don't see the amount of fat people anywhere else than you do here.  And the news, I love when they do the report.  We talk about it all the time when they have to take the B-roll from the neck down of fat  people when they're doing the fat story.  And we always imagine the person at home knowing that he wore those clothes out and was walking 
[02:08:00]  through Central Park.  And it's like, oh, my God, I'm the fat guy for the fat story.  Fatty number seven in the montage.  Fatty number seven.  I think it's sad on some level, but I've often thought about how the government should  get involved.  And I know that a lot of people don't think the government should be involved in our lives.  But I really think that they should, the Food and Drug Administration should create a  special task force of fat marshals.  You know, they have air marshals on the plane.  Yeah.  There's a terrorist.  They're going to snap into action and take care of it.  But I just think that they should have fat marshals that are out at McDonald's at Fridays 
[02:08:30]  and some of the chain restaurants.  If they see a guy over 250 pounds about to dig into a sundae, they just get up and go,  put the spoon down.  I'm a United States fat marshal.  Put the spoon down.  Step away from the ice cream.  But I really wasn't going to eat much of it.  Get away.  Drop it.  Drop it.  Drop it.  Drop it.  Drop the spoon.  How do you think the country, this country will just end?  Every empire has its day and then just ends.  How do you see the United States?  Because I'm amazed we can be so much in debt, have such a horribly out of shape people running 
[02:09:00]  around and still be the superpower on the planet.  Where does this end?  Well, I heard one idea.  The thing I've always thought is, and it's the best thing that could ever happen, is they  said, for some reason, on the same day, everybody on the planet wakes up and can't breathe properly.  And they finally go like, oh my God.  Maybe there's a problem.  If this is a common experience, perhaps, you know, maybe you got capitalism at this extreme  wasn't that great idea.  But I think the one thing I read that I thought was funny is that America just ends with a 
[02:09:30]  traffic jam.  You think it's just a big no one can get anywhere?  Oh, that's it.  Okay.  There's people outside their cars, everyone look at each other like, what the hell's going  on up there?  It finally happened.  Just complete gridlock of the entire country.  No one can get to work.  Like a clogged artery.  Right.  And our empire crumbles.  The end.  That's pretty good, man.  Mark Maron, we got to end this side of the show.  Unfortunately.  Mark is at the, we're going over to XM now. 
[02:10:00]  Mark, who's coming with us, is at Comics tonight and, I'm sorry, tomorrow and Saturday,  Friday, Saturday, 8.30, 10.45.  Comics here in New York on 14th Street, 212-524-2500.  And the tickets are 25% off with the promo code MMRADIO.  I don't know what that means.  Just scream it at whoever you're buying it from or you get put it on the website.  I think if you get the tickets online.  Oh, ComicsNY.com.  Comics with an X, N, Y, dot com.  Mark is a really funny comic.  He has just been left. 
[02:10:30]  It's probably going to be great shows.  Yeah.  No better time to see a comedian than in the height of depression.  I haven't seen you in a while.  I'll be there Friday, Mark.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thanks, fellas.  This weekend, I'll be there Friday to see Mark Maron.  Appreciate it.  Hey, we're going over to XM.  If you're not joining us, have a great day.  Bye.  Bye.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:11:00]  Welcome to XM Satellite Radio.  All right, let's crank this up.  I think we're ready to broadcast.  Mark Maron in studio for the XM portion.  Oh, I can't wait.  And go fuck.  Exactly.  Get one out.  I'm going to get a few out.  I've got some sort of Tourette's syndrome now that my wife left.  You know what that is?  Oh, yeah.  It's a heartbroken Tourette's.  This is where I can be just in regular conversation with somebody.  I can be with a bunch of guys. 
[02:11:30]  My friends know I have it.  They don't bring it to my attention anymore.  But I can just be in a car and be like, hey, let's go to In-N-Out Burger, get a cheeseburger  and some fries.  Fuck her.  What the fuck?  Who the hell just leaves?  That is bullshit.  Just leaves?  And a shake.  I think I want a shake.  And then maybe we'll go to that movie later.  Fucking bitch.  What the hell is that?  Sorry, fellas.  I have no control.  Maybe I need medicine.  Are you better after three months?  It's been like five months.  I'm a little better.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, there's waves of sadness.  And then there's waves of anger. 
[02:12:00]  And then there's waves.  Then there's the idealizing.  That's the one I hate.  Where you're sitting there like, oh, so perfect.  How could she be gone?  I used to make her pancakes.  You know?  I just remember making her coffee.  Everything was great when we had breakfast.  It was all the other time that was difficult.  But right when we wake up, things weren't polluted yet.  Right.  I used to do that.  I used to bake, you know.  And I'm not, you know.  I like to cook.  But I used to do these things.  I think it was to sublimate a certain amount of anger. 
[02:12:30]  You know what I mean?  Because I don't know if I'm very good at being selfless and nurturing and really showing up.  But I used to bake her banana bread and pancakes.  And then I realized, like, oh, my God.  Given my attitude, I know that's going into this cooking.  So now, literally, I'd bake a cake.  Like, here's your hate cake.  You want a hate cake?  How about some spike muffins?  You want some scone of resentment?  Would you like that?  See how that feels.  Fucking cake shaped like a hangman's noose.  Oh, God. 
[02:13:00]  I just turned 44 years old.  And this was a sad moment, though, on my birthday.  Like, I was with three guys.  I was thinking, here's how you get older, man.  There was a moment.  We ate dinner.  Like, so what do you want to do?  You want strippers or just get some ice cream?  You know, and it was a tough decision.  You know what I mean?  Like, I know ice cream's going to deliver.  You know what I mean?  I know that half bowl of vanilla ice cream is going to deliver.  Half the guys want ice cream, half the guys want strippers.  Yeah, exactly.  You eat a bowl of vanilla ice cream, it tastes like vanilla. 
[02:13:30]  You go see a stripper, you smell like vanilla for three days.  But we did both.  We did both.  And, you know, the ice cream was consistent.  But it happened to be, and I don't do the strip club thing, so it was all very exciting  to me because I believe.  I still believe.  Yeah.  And I don't know if it was a slow night or what, but these strippers, where we went,  it was crazy.  It was crazy.  You can't be believe guy.  No, I'm not.  I know what I'm getting into.  But in my head, because I'm sort of a stripper neophyte, in my head, that's sort of what you're 
[02:14:00]  paying for.  I mean, I'm not paying to, because it's either believe or you end up dating them for three  months and watching their kids while they're out lap dancing.  So, you know, that's really the choice.  If I'm going to pay for it, I want to believe.  And I did believe.  And she gave me her phone number.  And I'm like, I'm not calling.  I don't believe that much.  I don't need that.  Wow.  She gave me the number, though.  They don't always do that.  To be very honest, they really don't.  That probably means he was generous at the club.  Well, I wasn't that generous.  Like I said, I'm not a rich guy, and I know it was a slow night, but I don't know. 
[02:14:30]  Again, I don't go to a lot of strip clubs, but the fact that, you know, she put my hands  right on her breasts was sort of like...  Oh, yeah, that's kind of a...  That was different, right?  That doesn't happen.  See, I am special, Jim.  That was an indicator.  I got through.  You should believe then.  Well, where was it?  How many different...  California?  It was in California where, you know, they only do boobs, only tits with booze.  But without booze, you know, you can't serve alcohol where they show their pussies, which  is understandable, because, you know, pussies and alcohol, that's nothing but trouble. 
[02:15:00]  Especially when you've got a bunch of lonely, angry guys sitting there.  Pussies and alcohol, you've got to be careful.  Once you're showing snatch, you could get a drunk guy just diving in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pull a rocker.  I never understood that rule.  It's kind of silly.  It's going to be the booze that makes you, like, penetrate the woman live in front of  everybody.  I know your dick is limp when you're fucking drunk enough.  That's the best time to show a car.  Your fucking dick doesn't work.  Hey, why...  You don't need any more coffee, Mark.  What's going on over there?  I don't know.  You've got two different kinds of coffee over there. 
[02:15:30]  Here's what happens.  You've got the Starbucks, and then you've got the Mangia, whatever.  Yeah, I wake up, you know, seething sometimes.  I mean, I'm one of these people, like, I wake up, the alarm goes off, the first thing out  of my mouth is, oh, fuck, again?  Really?  We're going to do this day thing?  Yesterday was difficult, but I'll try.  I'll try.  So the best thing to do when you're seething is to have 19 cups of coffee so that anger  becomes formulated and it takes shape.  Oh, yeah.  It has fuel.  Yeah.  And then in L.A., you get on any highway, and then the anger just has a purpose. 
[02:16:00]  I really believe, and this is a true thing, I believe that traffic kills empathy.  Let me explain.  You ever been stuck in traffic for 25 minutes and then it just dissipates for no reason?  You're like, what the fuck was that?  Yeah.  That was about nothing?  How could that be about nothing?  And you feel like there's no justice in the world and that God's screwing you somehow?  But if you get stuck in the same traffic, here's how it kills empathy.  If you're in the same traffic for 25 minutes and you see the worst accident you've ever  seen in your life, all you can say is, oh, okay, good.  Good.  That's why.  Yeah, good.  At least there was a reason.  Yeah, that's good.  That's it right there.  There's a reason at least. 
[02:16:30]  At least there was a reason.  Yeah, there's justice in the world.  I have to stop myself from literally, like, I have moments in the car where, because I'm in  L.A. now, where I think it's a good idea, not a fantasy, to just plow my car into  the car in front of me, just do it.  And I know I'm going to do it.  Like, one day I'm just going to see the guy in the car in front of me get out and go,  what the fuck is wrong with you?  You weren't moving.  Well, no, no.  And I'm just going to go, I don't know, but I feel better, man.  You helped me out.  And then R.E.M., Everybody Hurts has to start playing.  Everybody Hurts.  Hey, yeah. 
[02:17:00]  I had road rage severe.  Today?  No, no.  I don't have it as much anymore.  But I used to just rage on the road, where I would punch the steering wheel and yell  at the top of my lungs.  Drive on sidewalks.  Just go like, fuck!  Oh, yeah.  No, now I just break the law.  Now I drive the law.  Drive up on the sidewalk.  I will drive up on the sidewalk.  The way I go home, through this part of Queens, there's nothing but warehouses in between where 
[02:17:30]  I am and the expressway.  So, as I'm driving through, a lot of tractor-trailers are backing into loading docks.  Yeah.  And the roads are narrow.  These warehouses were built when, like, the fucking little horse-drawn wagons were backing  into the warehouses.  We're delivering blocks of ice or something, Dom.  Now there's giant fucking tractor-trailers trying to back in, and it takes them forever.  And I will go around everyone on the sidewalk and just pop down the intersection when I'm done 
[02:18:00]  and drive off.  And lights?  Like, if I'm the first guy at a red light, or I can get around the guy that's the first  guy at the red light, I will look both ways, and if no cars are coming, I'll fucking go.  Yeah.  I go through a red light because I don't need to sit there and get pissed off that someone  in front of me fucked me, made it through the yellow light, he was doing three miles  an hour the whole way down the street, and then the light turns yellow.  He fucking takes off like a top-fueled dragster and leaves me ditched at the red light. 
[02:18:30]  I get so...  I hate people.  I fucking can't stand people on the road.  So now it's driven me to just break the law so I can put all that other shit behind  me.  Like, I made up time when I blew the lights.  I made up time driving on the sidewalk.  I made up time when I was able to do 110 on that stretch of expressway.  And now I'm in traffic, so now I can kind of sit and go, I'm still ahead of the game.  Don't you hate that moment where everyone's going slow and you start driving like a race  car driver.  Bam, bam. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  And then you end up at the light with the same three people you pass.  You can't even look at them.  You're sitting there like, don't look at me.  I made an effort.  Yeah, making amazing moves to get ahead of them.  I have a thing when somebody's in front of me and they're not going fast enough in that  left lane and it happens every time.  I don't know how they don't see the parade behind them and the clear fucking road to  the horizon in front of them.  But when I go around that person and then I speed up and I see there's a lot of traffic  and I'll go, now I know what this person's thinking.  See, he got you real far, didn't he? 
[02:19:30]  He cut me off.  But all I could think of is if I was ever confronted by that person, I would turn around and say,  yeah, and if every one of these motherfuckers wasn't an asshole like you, I'd fucking be home  right now.  Do you understand, though?  It's not me being the douchebag.  It's you being the douchebag.  The fact that you've played that scenario in your head proves you're a fucking kook.  Of course I am.  You've actually planned a dialogue between you and some anonymous driver where you straighten  them out.  It's usually a slender woman I can punch.  It's never a big guy because I would go, I'm sorry, sir. 
[02:20:00]  When you're in the car, you got to think about something.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, what are you going to do in the car?  Well, that's what we were talking about before about this jealousy thing.  Your issue is you're a jealous bastard.  I'll pay.  And you got no grounds for it.  My girlfriend I firmly believe doesn't cheat.  I really just don't think it's her nature because I was friends with her for years  before we date and I just kind of know her vibe.  And I think that when she's done, she's done.  But I'll paint these scenarios with her and other guys in my head.  And all of a sudden, I'm running with it and I know I'm creating this, but then I'm reacting 
[02:20:30]  to her in real life the way I've painted this scenario.  And it's fucking psyched.  I'm mad at her.  Yeah.  I'm like, you fucking cunt.  And she didn't do anything.  I used to do that.  I'm nuts.  Wow.  I was one of those guys, man.  I would leave the house.  This was years ago.  I can cure jealousy.  I got a couple of pointers for it.  But I used to leave the house literally.  And within 10 minutes, I'm like, oh, she's fucking two guys in front of a picture of me  laughing.  You know what I mean?  And then you carry that with you.  And then you go back to the house and you walk in.  You're like, what's going on?  Where are the guys? 
[02:21:00]  What's up?  You say, what are you talking about?  Don't fuck with me.  You know?  And then you're a lunatic.  Holy shit.  And then a couple of things happened as I got older was that, first of all, my wife  was beautiful, spectacular looking.  And I once said to her, I said, do guys hit on you?  And she looked at me.  She goes, look at me.  And I'm like, okay, I get it.  I can't afford to think that way.  I got to trust you.  And then what happened was after a certain point, I realized I cured it with mathematics.  Two ways I cured it.  Math, and I'm not a math guy.  But I was with her long enough to where we had sex probably a thousand times. 
[02:21:30]  So I started thinking like, okay, so if she fucks some other guy once, I'm still way ahead.  I'm still winning.  And I'm not easily erased.  And then the other weird thing that happened was, and I don't know why you haven't picked  up on this.  And to me, what happened was I'm in the middle of a jealous fantasy, right?  And I'm like, oh, she's probably fucking my friend.  She's probably fucking that guy, Paul.  Because I know she likes Paul.  And then I'm like, I'm thinking about it.  I'm like, fuck.  And then all of a sudden, something changes.  I'm like, yeah, she's fucking him.  Hell, it's hot. 
[02:22:00]  And then I'm in the fantasy.  And I'm like, all of a sudden, I'm jerking off to my jealous fantasies.  And they took a whole different light.  Wow.  That is bizarre.  Is it, though?  No.  It's, I've done the same fucking thing.  Well, I try to conquer my jealousy because I'm such a loon that I'm like, let me just picture  her fucking other people.  And boy, it does help.  It really does help.  I love it.  How could that possibly help?  Because there's websites dedicated to it.  But don't you think everyone has that thought in their heads?  You guys are making it sound like you're like normal on this. 
[02:22:30]  No.  They take it to the umpteenth level, man.  I think every person has that insecurity in their head and worry about who they're with.  But when you take actual real anger out on a real person based on fantasy, that's where  you're entering a weird little zone there.  We wouldn't act on that.  They just are, they convince themselves that what they're thinking is actually true.  But that fantasy Mark is talking about, I get this.  I'll tell you how you can get off to it.  The idea of watching my girlfriend fuck somebody else driving, I couldn't handle it.  But I love her. 
[02:23:00]  So it's hard for me to picture somebody I love as a fucking cum pig because I have a sex  love thing.  So when I'm fantasizing while I'm fucking her about her fucking somebody, I'm seeing her  as a pornographic figure.  It makes it easier for me to fuck her and be dirty with her than like just to go with the  That's a crush on.  That's interesting.  Because I would think a guy that has had his dick where you've had yours and over a certain  period of time, that some of that would be demystified in terms of sex.  Because I think the jealousy thing is really about trust and betrayal.  It's not about sex, really. 
[02:23:30]  It's about not knowing and feeling like a clown, really.  Oh, God.  Exactly.  A clown is exactly what it is.  You're afraid of being a fucking clown.  You're a douchebag.  Well, that's it.  But you're going to be...  The thing about guys...  Everyone knows but you.  Right.  You might as well...  Like when I was married the first time, I was married once before, my first wife.  And that was sort of a mistake because I married a Jew.  But I'm a Jew.  So let me explain that.  Because I just found if you're a Jew and you marry a Jew, that means everything you hated 
[02:24:00]  about going home is now in your house.  But you thought you guys would get married and make a positive.  But the weird thing was is that the scariest thing about that is that I've been in relationships  where I haven't been straight and I have fooled around.  And the truth of the matter is is that after a certain point, if you're with a woman that  you're doing that to, when you go out for dinner, you go out to a party, you might as  well say, wait, you forgot your clown shoes.  Because everyone knows. 
[02:24:30]  It's like you're saying.  And you might as well just wear a nose in the clown because that's what everyone's thinking  anyways.  And it's sort of a cruel thing to do to people.  And you don't want to be that guy.  No.  Because you're going to be a clown anyways.  A guy in any relationship ultimately is a clown.  Because my wife was 12 years younger than me.  And I knew going in, how the fuck am I not going to be a clown at some point?  How am I not going to be old guy?  How is that not going to eventually happen?  If you're dating a woman who's significantly younger than you, the first time you go down  on her, you better look in the mirror because you're wearing a clown's nose.  You just don't see it.  Because you're in. 
[02:25:00]  It's just a matter of time before you got the whole outfit and she leaves.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's right.  She leaves and you're at the door going, what should I do?  She says, you better call somebody.  Like, do I have to take off my outfit?  No.  Leave the outfit out.  You're still a clown for a while.  Don't worry about it.  You've just earned your clown stripes, my friend.  I'm taking the car.  You could take the little one with 12 of your friends in it.  It'll pile out.  That's exactly it.  Let's go to the phones.  We got Shane in Sacramento.  Shane, what's up, buddy? 
[02:25:30]  Hey, I can totally identify with Mark.  My wife ended up dumping me after 18 fucking years.  Oh, God.  18 years?  Out of nowhere?  18 years and she has this fucking epiphany after her sister dies.  She needs to move on with life without me.  You know, forget about 18 years and forget about that we got two great kids and all this.  No, she needs to be happy.  Oh, God.  That's funny.  Wow.  I'm sorry, buddy.  Fortunately, I don't have any kids because I can't even imagine what that would be like 
[02:26:00]  to have that because now you've got to see her, right?  A complete connection for the rest of your life.  When I go to work, I've got to drive by her house and I just turn into a fucking bitter  divorce guy.  Fuck you, Esther.  Off I go down the road.  You know, it sucks.  It's like, how did I get here?  Did you go out and fuck her friends yet?  You know, I would if she did, but no.  No.  I should.  I don't know if I would take my advice specifically, but I just want you to feel better.  Oh, I do. 
[02:26:30]  I'm actually in a good place.  All my friends hate her and have hated her for years.  I got to say, a friend of mine got split up from his wife and he always told his wife  that her friends were cunts and she didn't believe him.  So when they split up, he fucked all of his wife's friends just to prove that they were  cunts.  Wow.  I kind of love that he did that.  Wow.  Does he feel better, though?  I don't know.  I haven't talked to him.  Because I don't know if that's a practical approach.  I think in the short term, it probably feels pretty good.  Yeah, but probably just it's a good way to just stick it to somebody.  I don't want to know you anymore. 
[02:27:00]  I don't want to know what you're doing.  I don't care.  Like, if I break up with somebody, it's so, and it's been that way my whole life.  It's so completely over.  I've never been friends with an ex or anything like that.  That's why I'm glad with my ex-wife, I never had kids either.  Because the thought, it's bad enough having to deal with the legal ramifications of finances  still, eight years later.  I couldn't imagine having a connection with an ex because you have a kid. 
[02:27:30]  That's a lifelong connection.  There's, you know, graduation and marriages and kids and grandkids and things that you  now are connected to a person that, for the most part, a lot of times you can't fucking  stand.  And those are the guys that are real balls.  I'll tell you, my brother, here I'm like I'm a whiny baby.  I was with this woman eight years.  I'm deeply in love with her.  We've been married for three.  So she leaves.  We got no, we got no kids.  So there's really nothing that's, you know, once the money thing is settled, it's done. 
[02:28:00]  Done.  So my brother's got three kids.  You know, he's divorced from his wife and his new girlfriend has four kids.  So they're literally, it's like this Jewish Brady bunch.  And for some reason or another, their exes are seeing each other.  Right.  So it's a, it's a clusterfuck.  Right.  So I go to this ball game with my brother.  I go visit him and I go to the ball game and his kids, you know, his kids are there.  Her kids is playing ball.  Well, the, one of the exes is there and her father's, and I'm like, I got no problems.  I mean, this, this, this is real balls to accept that and have to deal with that and live that 
[02:28:30]  with that on day to day level.  How do you do that?  Well, we're comedians.  We're such selfish children.  I mean, I, I, I really believe that if you don't have kids after a certain point, you're  just doomed to be one that there's no way around it.  And so like, I'm, I'm sitting here whining and bitching like, and he's got to deal with  this on a day to day basis with a certain amount of dignity.  I mean, those are the guys that you like, if you really want to have a hero and in the  emotional light, guys who step up to that responsibility and don't end up killing somebody  or beating the shit out of a, uh, domestic abuse or ruining the kids. 
[02:29:00]  I mean, those guys are the real heroes.  They're guys who really accept that responsibility and deal with it on a mature level.  I don't know if I could do it.  I thought Robert Duvall handed it well in the apostle.  There was such a great moment with that.  He fucking made you.  It was such a weird moment.  Duvall's wife had left him for another guy.  They're at the little league game and he's trying to rustle his wife.  You know, come on, let's just go.  Let's just go.  It's like, you're watching this guy just trying to make it okay.  And she's leaving with the other guy and he grabs the bat in a moment and he clunks 
[02:29:30]  the other guy on the head and he kills him.  And it's like, you so get his moment there.  Like I could absolutely fucking do that.  That's all.  That's all the half a murder in general.  It's, it's all, it's always over pussy and money.  There's nothing else.  I mean, on a global level, pussy, money and territory.  That's all it is.  I mean, that's why the, there's a really small menu of the way humans fuck up.  And that's why there are those laws because that's all of it.  I mean, is, is that feeling?  I mean, what are you going to do?  You got a choice.  Am I going to be sad or am I going to be angry? 
[02:30:00]  Am I going to process these feelings or am I going to live with them for the rest of  my life?  Hate all women, fuck her friends and be a miserable bastard and never be able to be  intimate again.  So that's the choice I'm up against right now.  Let me do a, let me do a reset here because they're getting a lot of people in  and some feedback saying, who is this guy?  They're, they're loving you, Mark.  And it's Mark Marin.  He's playing comics here in New York city, uh, tomorrow and Saturday night, two shows,  both nights tickets, two, one, two, five, two, four, twenty, five hundred.  A bunch of us will probably go to the Friday show, man, to see Mark Marin.  And like I said, a great time to see a comedian, especially one who's introspective and talks 
[02:30:30]  about his life is one who is going through an agonizing, having, I mean, not to make light  of it, but if you're going to watch a comic, you want a comic who has been dumped within  six months and that's the way to see if I'm going to get some passion.  Let's say hi to Dave in South Carolina.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Um, I love the show.  I love turtles.  I was with my girlfriend for eight years and, uh, she started screwing around with me, uh,  with a doctor in her office.  So we were both runners.  And so we were, uh, I was training for this half marathon and, uh, I got to the halfway 
[02:31:00]  mark knowing that she and her, um, gay boyfriend were going to run the half marathon.  I got to the halfway mark and went, fuck it.  I'm going for the whole thing.  So I ran, I only trained for 15 miles.  I ran 26.2 miles that one day, the whole time, the last 10 miles going, fuck you, fuck  you, fuck you.  But now her gay boyfriend got cancer.  So fuck her.  Jeez, man.  Wow.  I kill rich cunt.  I'm a goddamn rich cunt. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, our own Sonny Farrelli's going through a divorce.  I didn't know that.  Sonny.  Hey guys, what's happening?  The fucking phone connections really suck.  I can hardly hear you, but, but yeah, I'm going through the fucking shit right now.  And, uh, and I'm, I'm, I'm at the fucking point now where I'm taking all the fucking  blame on all this shit.  And I don't even know why I'm taking all the blame because she was the one who fucking  cheated on my ass.  Oh God.  Is she that, is she that girl?  I think I met her.  We all met her.  I, I, I, I talked to her at FH Riley's a couple of times. 
[02:32:00]  It doesn't matter in court, um, who did what it's as far as the finances go, you'll get  fucked.  It's just what happened.  I mean, they have this formula in New York that like, it's just, you, you want to believe  that, that some, an attorney is going to bust in with some evidence or something.  You go, ah, your honor, you look at this, but they just take a slide rule out and fucking  calculator and go, okay, person A, get person B this.  That's it.  There's no personal, it's better to mediate, right?  I mean, if you can, it's better to just settle it. 
[02:32:30]  In your case, Anthony, that slide ruler was stuck somewhere.  Yeah.  It was way to the left.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're able to slide it way the fuck over one, one way.  I think we wound up doing it that way because, uh, it just would have dragged on forever.  Yeah.  It reached the point where I, I just went, look, we got to go in this room over here and just  sit and, and hash this out.  Right.  And I, you know, the sad thing is I really tried, you know, I, right when it happened,  I'm like, I'm going to do whatever I can.  It was, it was, it was the pathetic thing, man.  Yeah.  What makes it even worse for me too, is that I'm a recovering fucking drunk too. 
[02:33:00]  And thank God I haven't fucking picked up a drink over this shit.  I tell you, man, it saved my life.  If I hadn't been in the rooms, buddy, I, I don't know what the hell I would have done.  I have no fucking idea.  Yeah.  That's the one great thing about, uh, about, you know, being a, a recovering drunk is  that when, when the shit hits the fan, all of a sudden you got a million people you  can call every day and, you know, and if you got to line enough of them up, because  at some point you cross a line and when they see your name on this call or I did, they're  like, nah, he's probably not going to kill himself. 
[02:33:30]  I'm sure he's got other numbers.  Yeah.  I just want to call him.  Thanks, man.  I know I'm fucking identifying a lot and I, you know, I, I got a shitty connection.  Hey, Sonny, how did, how did you know she cheated?  What happened?  I fucking caught her on the phone with her fucking ex-boyfriend.  You caught her talking dirty or you caught her talking?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Jim's like.  She was on the phone in the porch, you know, she comes in, she opens the door of my bedroom,  she closes the door thinking that I was asleep.  Then I go outside and she's out on the porch on the phone and then she denied that she was  even on the fucking phone until I had to rip it out of her hands and then I looked out 
[02:34:00]  the fucking car log and she's been calling this guy for fucking weeks.  But is that cheating?  Um, do you think she was fucking him or just preparing to?  Well, no, no, she already can't clean.  Didn't she, I mean, she crossed the line, she, she made out with him.  She didn't actually fuck him yet, but you know.  Oh God, it's even worse in a way.  Oh yeah.  Because that means that they're like dating.  You know, if you're just having sordid sex in a hotel room in a, you know, along the  road in New Jersey, I mean, that is what it is.  But if you're like talking for three hours, I, but you know, right now I'm at that stage 
[02:34:30]  where, you know, I'm feeling guilty that I pushed her to that point, you know, don't  do it.  No, you didn't.  Fucking self-centered.  No, it's a two-way street, man.  She was getting something out of it.  You got to give yourself a break or you're going to drive yourself crazy.  That's, I mean, I did that for two months.  Yeah, I'm about, I'm about there because I'm ready to go on a fuck fest pretty soon.  Fuck fest.  I don't think that's a, I like it.  Yeah, you got to, you know, fuck yourself out of the cage.  Let's talk to Brother Elmo, fuck fest t-shirts for everybody in honor of Sonny Ferelli. 
[02:35:00]  All right, Sonny, hang in there, will you?  All right, will do.  You're one of the good ones.  You're one of the good ones.  Good luck, Sonny.  Sonny Ferelli, everyone from Boston.  That's a, that's a bitch.  Maybe Sonny could, could resume his relationship with Leon.  I mean, considering that you robbed a bank for him.  Oh, lovely.  He looks so cute in his robe.  You're not dying, Sonny.  You're killing everyone around you.  You'll, you'll appreciate this, Jim.  Can I, you want to take a call?  Can I talk for a second?  Yeah, go ahead, Mark.  Is that, yeah, I, I'm grateful that, you know, that there was another guy involved because 
[02:35:30]  I thought there was.  I mean, she was emotionally detached, but he really just, and I, again, as angry as I am,  I understand what she did and I understand my partner, but the desperation, like when  she left, you know, we, you know, I got her to go to couples counseling once a month, twice  a month, just so we could check in with each other.  You know, I would dress up.  I would buy new shoes.  I mean, just seeing myself do that, you know, I started doing shit around the house.  I built a table.  So when she came to get her mail and, and the saddest part about it, and this is one thing  if I, if there are a lot of women listening is that after a certain point, you know, she 
[02:36:00]  would come get her mail at the house and, and I knew it was pretty much over.  And, and it's just like, if you're, if you're that woman who left a guy, you're still dangling  him.  Just do have the heart to at least, you know, if you're going to come over for the mail  and we haven't seen you in a month and we're in a lot of pain, fuck us.  I mean, can't you just fuck us?  I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I don't know why I didn't get that.  Cause you know, after you break up supposedly like, you know, don't you want to try it to  see if it's still good.  And that is the saddest fucking moment where you're with your wife and she's come over to get 
[02:36:30]  the mail and you try to fuck her and she's not going to do it.  And, you know, and, and, and it's like, really, you're not, I mean, don't you want to at all?  And she's like, I just don't think it'd be a good idea.  And this is a woman that initially you said, I love you so much.  I would never, I don't never, I want to, I want to be with you all the time.  You're the best.  You're the perfect woman.  And then it digresses to me at the door and she's walking out with her mail and I'm saying,  can you just show me your ass and let me jerk off?  Can you just do that?  And she looks at me and she looks at me, she goes, really?  And I'm like, yeah. 
[02:37:00]  And she goes, she goes, really?  You really want to do that?  I'm like, I don't know.  No, just go.  Was she going to do it?  No, who knows if she was going to do it?  Would that qualify her?  I mean, you know, it's like she made me feel bad for thinking it.  And then I realized, like, yeah, that is kind of pathetic.  And I'm like, just go.  I'm going to do it anyways.  Hey, I don't want to lose this guy.  We have a great call.  Can you show me your ass?  Yeah.  Jeffrey in New York.  What's up, Jeffrey?  Do we, oh, come on.  Jeffrey, call back.  Jeffrey.  This is a really good one, too.  Yeah, he probably would have fucked the story up, though. 
[02:37:30]  That's a college do.  Well, maybe Jeffrey will call back if he's not there.  It says, married 25 years.  Wife just told me she wanted someone else the whole time.  Now, what the hell good is that?  The whole fucking time.  Jeffrey, call back.  That is just cruel.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, I've gotten some of that.  You see, that's what happens with the resentment thing.  It's like, she kept me going along.  And every time I saw her, she would say something hurtful.  And it's just, it's a matter of punishment.  That's how they're going to get back at me? 
[02:38:00]  Like, my wife said, what she said, oh, it's a doozy.  I'm trying to, like, kind of make common ground.  I'm like, look, you know, I wasn't that happy either.  And she says, how could you be?  You had a wife who was disappointed in you.  I'm like, wow.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh.  I mean, was that necessary?  I get it.  I was an asshole.  I mean, what do I got to do?  You want me to cut myself?  Look, I'm bleeding.  Look, I've cut my nipples off.  Doug in Wisconsin.  What's up?  Can I say about that guy, Jeff, whose wife?  Yeah, what's up, boy? 
[02:38:30]  Hold on.  Hold on, buddy.  I just want to make a point.  The guy whose wife wanted somebody else for 25 years, if you're going to get divorced,  how great is that?  Like, ha ha, bitch.  You had to fuck me when you wanted him.  Like, how great is that to know I was dumping loads on you for a quarter century, and it  wasn't what you wanted.  I win.  You know, you...  I wonder how Jimmy spun that knife for that guy.  That's the mathematical thinking.  That's it.  See, that's the same kind of thing in the mathematics.  You turn that around.  Oh, you wanted him, and this is what you got. 
[02:39:00]  Thanks for fucking...  Blorka, blorka, blorka.  You took lemons and made loads of cum that she didn't want on her back.  That's right.  We took lemons and we wrecked your womb.  Let's say hi to Doug again.  Doug, what's up, buddy?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, so I did this woman all through college.  Everything seems great.  Getting married right after college, thinking everything's fine.  Two years into it after college, I'm out to dinner with my wife at the time, and we get  some people to show up that worked for her from the hospital. 
[02:39:30]  She was a nurse.  Come to find out, there's some drugs missing from the Pixis.  So, anyways, all this stuff unravels.  She's been stealing drugs from the Pixis at the hospital.  Ends up trying to sell the stuff.  I end up serving papers, divorce her, and all this stuff like that, just all this crazy  stuff, being dishonest and whatnot else.  Come to find out, she's racked up over $65,000 in debt that I didn't even know about.  And the worst thing of all, me being a young guy, got no money, just working my ass off, 
[02:40:00]  I got to take on almost $33,000 worth of debt.  Yeah, that's your debt, too.  Holy shit.  You know, I didn't even think about that, I don't know, oh my God.  Oh, boy.  I don't even know what her debt is.  I mean, I think, I don't think she has any.  Oh, shit.  I think you're staying too close to her.  That's why you're still feeling bad, like, this many months later.  Like, because I'm hearing, like, coming over for the mail and things like that, and like,  like, clean, clean fucking break. 
[02:40:30]  Well, now she thinks, after I filed for divorce, because I filed, you know, I did it.  You know, she wanted three months, and, you know, at two months, you know, I was like,  this is crazy, what do I got to live in?  You know, she doesn't know what she wants to do, she's dangling me, she's being passive  aggressive, she's taking every opportunity to say hurtful shit, and I'm trying my best  to get her back.  And then after three months, you know, I just said, fuck it, you know, she's like, I don't  know what I'm going to know.  And I'm like, well, I'm going to file for divorce.  She's like, I can't believe you did that.  Really?  You can't believe that after three months, I didn't want to live in relation to your indecision, and  what, I'm going to ask you permission to have a life here? 
[02:41:00]  Were you trying to kind of force her hand, like, you know, she's going to get off the  pot?  Well, what the deal was, it's like, at that point, what are you going to do?  You're going to say, okay, you're going to say, look, either I'm going to ask you permission  to start dating, or to start having a life here, or I'm just going to do this, and you  go do what you got to do, and in California, you got a six-month window, the judge won't  look at it for six months, so you can stop the process at any time, you know, go do what  you got to do, I just want to have this, because I don't want to have conversations  with you that are just going to open myself up for abuse.  Do you think she was keeping you hanging on in a way, until she was completely over 
[02:41:30]  it, and could move on, almost like, okay, I want to make sure the pain won't be bad for  me, so that I can leave when it's pain-free.  I think she was done when she left, was confused in terms of how to handle it, in terms of my  feelings, because she does love me, and she wanted to do it gracefully.  Yeah, sorry.  Jeffrey called back.  Sorry, I was just making a point.  Yeah, his name's actually Everett.  Oh, hi, Everett.  Everett, what happened?  Hello. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, Everett.  Everett.  Jeffrey.  Hello.  Yeah, you.  You!  What?  Hello.  Hello.  Yes, hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Your phones are fucked up.  Come on, dude.  Yeah, the phones are screwed up, eh?  No, they're not.  If you heard that, then they're not screwed up.  Well, I see...  You're on the air.  Hold on.  I do see that this button is pushed.  I don't know what that means or anything, but maybe someone should take a look.  Hold on.  Hold on, bro.  Let me see if I can do it this way.  Everett.  I was listening to himself on the radio.  Hey, guys.  All right.  The phone is fucked up. 
[02:42:30]  No shit.  Well, buddy, you heard that.  No, because I moved him to another line, and it's working.  Can you hear me now?  The studio's got to be set right every fucking day.  Come on.  Everett, what's up?  Well, married 25 years.  Came up on my 25th anniversary, and, you know, I said to the wife, listen, this was before  the anniversary.  We don't seem to communicate much anymore.  You know, we're heading towards a split.  Maybe.  Look, I'm not stupid.  I know what maybe means. 
[02:43:00]  So, I see an email that she's calling her girlfriend.  She's writing her girlfriend, and in the email, it's saying, I just got off the phone  with him.  Oh, my God.  All in capital letters.  Oh, boy.  I'm like, what's this?  Oh, this is a guy I know for 38 years.  I've always had feelings for him.  Then what the fuck did you marry me for?  I don't mean to laugh at her, but God.  You know, what the?  Holy shit.  Plus, I have a radical prostatectomy. 
[02:43:30]  She's telling me, go get a girlfriend if you need a woman's warmth.  Oh, that's horrible, buddy.  Hey, you know, life goes on.  Yeah, yeah.  So, what happened?  Well, we're going to get a legal separation.  I have, it took us 11 years to have kids.  I got two beautiful kids.  Boy and a girl.  Everyone's got beautiful kids.  Why are kids fucking ugly?  Plus, I've got a...  I want to hear...  One fucking set of parents go, I got two kids, you know. 
[02:44:00]  I got two ugly kids.  I love them and all, but they're ugly.  I love them.  I have two beautiful children.  I got one good one.  And the other one, I don't know.  Yeah, or two.  One's really...  The other one, if it didn't come from my cunt, I would never talk to it again.  I have one winner and one with a Pete Rose hairdo.  No, we're just saying, everyone, Jimmy, came back in, everyone always says, I have two  beautiful kids.  I got three, whatever number it is. 
[02:44:30]  No one's willing to admit that the kid's ugly.  Beautiful kids.  One deserved a hanger through his head.  Right.  Whatever, I got you.  So, what's up?  Well, I also have a malpractice suit going.  As soon as we settle the suit, I'm leaving.  That's what she said?  Yeah.  So, she's waiting for the payoff?  Oh.  Well, no.  She won't get a payoff.  I mean, I went to my lawyers, too.  Yeah.  And they're saying, no, that, you know, all she'll get is, she'll get $5,000 because  you can't walk the dog anymore.  I'll tell you, you don't know who you're married to until this stuff goes down, you 
[02:45:00]  know, in terms of, you know...  Oh, you know, it's unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  You know, but I'll, I mean, I'm going to deal with it all.  Life goes on.  I got you guys to listen to, you know, shit like that.  Well...  I can't talk about stuff because of pending litigation.  Really?  I hope I didn't get myself in trouble.  I'm talking, I was married eight years ago.  I, I, I, eight years ago was pretty much the divorce, seven and change.  Uh, I was supposed to be in court today and, uh, it got postponed until December 20th or 
[02:45:30]  something like that.  But, but, but the idea that, that, that much fucking time went by and I'm still having  to go to court has me, uh, playing livid.  I can't remember.  How'd you play in Half-Life 2 all night long?  Uh, chapter two.  Portals.  It's great.  Great game.  Distracting, distraction.  Distraction, distraction.  Please.  Distraction, distraction. 
[02:46:00]  The amazing hypocrisy of it is that, you know, there, that since women fought for all this  ground for themselves, you know, to get careers and, and, and get equal treatment and, and  which is all fine and it's good and I'm happy and I really want her to have the best and  I, I, I really don't, I, I don't want her to have any pain.  I don't, I, I want her to have a good life.  I honestly do.  But the, the weird thing about it is, is that, you know, all through the marriage, you married  to somebody.  I didn't, I didn't ask her to work.  I never made any unreasonable demands.  I wanted her to have a career.  I wanted her to do her stand up.  I wanted to do whatever the hell she needed to do and I didn't pressure her at all and 
[02:46:30]  she always had some sense of guilt about not bringing money in.  I was like, don't worry about it.  We're covered.  You know, I'm working.  I'm doing the radio show.  I'm staying up all night, you know, busting my ass trying to, you know, keep us afloat  and then like she gets a payday, she takes off, all right?  And now, cause she's mad at me.  Now she's like, I'm coming after your money and, and, and, and it's like, there's on some  level, I don't understand that, that part of the brain where it's like, how could you  feel like how, it's shameful.  It's shameful.  Just, just walk away.  You made some money.  You know, the situation I'm in, I'm struggling too. 
[02:47:00]  What do you got to do that for?  What does it get?  What kind of karma is that going to get you?  Cause you're legally entitled.  You got to be an evil person.  And I was nice to the person.  Evil person.  Yeah.  It went from C to B to person.  Yeah.  We saw that.  Evil blank.  I mean, let the, let them fill in the blank.  Man.  No, I don't, uh, what you got married twice.  So you actually did it twice.  Yeah.  You know, the first time it was like I was, it was one of those situations where I'd been  with the woman eight years.  I really grabbed hold of her.  You know, I was at my brother's wedding. 
[02:47:30]  I was the best man and she was the maid of honor.  I was out of my mind on drugs and booze.  And I, and I, and I saw her friend.  I'm like, well, if you're going to take my brother, I'm taking your friend.  And, uh, you know, so I, so I, I married her cause I thought it would, it would help.  It would be good.  I didn't marry her though.  I, I, I dated her for eight years and then it gets, you get into that weird zone with  that stuff where, you know, like, what am I going to do here?  It's been eight years and they want to know what it's going to do.  And you know, when, when you've been in a relationship that long, it takes a little  momentum out of the proposal.  Cause I think I actually bought her a ring.  I opened the box.  I said, so you want to break up or one or the other. 
[02:48:00]  So it was not, it was not a great situation.  She's, she's turned out.  Okay.  I, I don't know what the hell's going to happen to me.  It's starting to think like, okay, so I'm 44.  Am I ever going to have a healthy relationship or am I just going to be like a, a bad phase  in a series of troubled young women's lives?  You know, is that my destiny?  Oh, just this bad memory.  That's your legacy.  Exactly.  That's a horrible memory.  I'm not going to be a mythic comic, but I will be remembered. 
[02:48:30]  God damn it.  I want to, I don't want to lose these two guys.  We've got two more that are really good before we take a break here.  Keith in Michigan.  What's up?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're with Mark Maron.  Hey guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey man.  Hey, I'm a check driver out here on the road, yo.  Been married for six years.  I just found out on Sunday.  I've been out here for about two weeks now.  Found out on Sunday.  My wife packed up half my house and left.  Oh my God.  What was the reason?  She said because I had anger issues. 
[02:49:00]  That trumps everything.  Yeah.  She said, she lied to me all week last week.  I'm following you every day.  Oh, I love you.  I love you.  And in the meantime, she was moving shit out of my house as she's talking to me.  Did she hire one of your buddies to come pick it up in a truck?  No, actually, she had her ex-husband come help her.  Oh, great.  I'll tell you this thing with the anger, man.  Ex-husband.  The thing with the anger is that, and if I can help anybody, is that you have to realize  that if you've got angry issues and you're in a marriage or relationship, that your wife 
[02:49:30]  or your girlfriend is scared of you, and it's a real fear, and the reason that that happened  is that, how could she tell you?  Because she was afraid of you.  I mean, that's the thing about anger.  It's a very destructive thing, and I definitely, you know, I can't be proud of it.  You?  I mean, you don't want it.  It's an awful thing.  It's all-consuming.  It's awful.  I'm the opposite.  I've always been a doormat.  Yeah, no, I never was.  No, I'm not.  It's my greatest terror.  Like you said, it's a clown shoe. 
[02:50:00]  It's a great way to put it because you're terrified of all the things that you're going to do.  All of a sudden, walking into a room, and everyone going, surprise!  And it's the humiliation, like they all know.  It's the humiliation surprise party.  Yes, but they've all been watching and laughing and winking and elbowing and nodding, and I  will never be that guy.  It's just the humiliation.  It's all childish.  You don't want to be that guy.  Keith, you all right, though?  Well, you know, I don't think it's really going to hit me much until I get home, but... 
[02:50:30]  Well, did you try to...  I talked to her on Monday, you know?  She told me I had anger issues and this and that.  Then she got off the phone with me.  I was in Iowa when she told me.  And she got off the phone with me and called the police and told the police that I was coming  out to her work.  I was a thousand miles away from home.  Oh, that's a little crazy.  What you ought to do, you're a trucker, you know this.  You go into a bathroom, you look for a skull and a hole cut in it, you put your erection  through it, and you smile.  Somebody will help you.  Or just tap your foot a little. 
[02:51:00]  Or just drive your rig into someone's house.  That's not expected.  Don't be concerned with the gender on the other side of the hole.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why, man.  My first marriage made me like Captain Quint.  Like, I'll never put on a wedding ring again.  Oh, yeah.  Not again.  I'll do it again.  Not after the first wife.  I'll do it again.  Would you?  Yeah, because I like, you know, well, the thing was with this one, I really, I fucking loved  her.  I mean, I was like, I wanted her more than anything in the world.  Oh, boy. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, man.  And it feels great.  I don't, you know, I'm heartbroken, but I needed, I needed to be humbled.  You know, let me tell this guy, the sad thing about anger, is his name Keith?  Yeah.  Is that it, this is the worst thing about it, and my biggest regret is that it trumps every  memory, that, you know, that no matter what your memory is, you can sit there and it's  like, well, what about the time we were in, we were in Florence, Italy, remember, and  we had that great time?  And then it's always going to be like, well, what about the time you broke the chair?  The broken chair will trump any good memory you have, and that's what you're up against. 
[02:52:00]  And man, I'll tell you, when someone leaves you, that's when you really find out what kind  of salesman you are, because at that moment, you better have something to say other than,  hey, I didn't fuck anybody and they didn't hit you.  You know, you better, you better have a better, better presentation than that.  But if you have no recourse, if you can't convince them again that you're going to change,  then you got, you got no fucking game.  You have one last shot is what you're saying.  Exactly.  And if that's all you got, if I'm not Hitler, yeah, that's you, the fucking buzzer, you're 
[02:52:30]  on the other side of the court and you're fucking giving it the heave-ho.  So it better be a good one.  All right, definitely.  All right.  Let's think about it, Keith.  Keep hanging in there.  All right, Keith.  All right, man.  Talk to you guys later.  This one is amazing.  It's Dan in New York.  Dan, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I got an interesting story for you.  My mom and dad are married for like 30 years, right?  One day, four o'clock in the morning, my dad shows up in my apartment.  He's been cheating on my mom for three years with this prostitute who's two years younger  than I am.  She's a crackhead. 
[02:53:00]  And he leaves my mom for this girl.  Start smoking crack, loses his $100,000 a year job to fucking smoke crack and drink  with his fucking prostitute.  Your fucking dad rules.  That's the best story I've ever had.  That is...  I think dad's having a good time.  I don't think they make a...  They don't make a Hallmark car for that on Wednesday.  Dad's had it with responsibility.  Yeah, dear mom, sorry dad left.  Apparently you used teeth.  I would love...  I love my mother, but if my dad left her for a crack whore, I'd just start doing dope. 
[02:53:30]  How do you not love him?  That's a great story.  How old's your dad?  My dad was 54.  54.  He was starting a career in crack.  He's going out in a blaze of crack.  You know what?  He was ready.  That's great.  He was ready for something new.  That's a hard place to be.  All right, Dan.  Hang in there.  What a hard place to be as a kid.  Yeah, no kidding.  My dad was a bit of a mess, but that's just classic.  Four in the morning, he's probably all cracked up.  I got a confession to make.  And he tells him that story, and then he goes, you got 10 bucks. 
[02:54:00]  Keith, the trucker.  A lot of truckers checking in today.  Keith?  We just talked to Keith.  Another one.  Good morning, guys.  Hey, Keith.  Yeah, Jimmy may recognize this.  I spoke about this on the very first Black Phillip show.  I've been married for 18 years.  I've been with my old lady for almost 22.  She had 12 relations while we were dating, eight more in the first almost three years  of marriage, and then she was good up until four years ago.  As a matter of fact, today is the four-year anniversary of the 21st affair she had on me. 
[02:54:30]  Wow.  And actually, thanks to a lot of Patrice's advice, even some stuff Jimmy told me that night.  We're still together, and I've become so distant that I'm a complete basket case.  There's a couple weird things going on.  A couple?  There's a few weird things going on here.  First of all, you keep track of how many guys she's been with while married to you.  You're a cuckold.  How does that work?  A cuckold?  He's beyond that.  She tells you?  Wow.  I used to think it was 30.  As a matter of fact, that's what I had to count for. 
[02:55:00]  36 dicks?  Why the hell are you still...  What are you putting...  You devil.  What are you...  What are you, Jesus?  What are you putting up with that for?  I'll tell you the truth.  She's...  What disease are you trying to cure?  She's been in absolute pursuit of me since I became so distant, and it's actually great  from that aspect.  She really wants me, really wants the marriage to work.  Apparently so.  She's going out...  She's got her shit together.  Fucking 21 lives.  She's got a problem, bro.  She's got...  She's bipolar, and to be honest, now that she's on medication, she is a changed person. 
[02:55:30]  I don't even recognize her, attitude-wise.  So bipolar is some nasty shit, and that is one of the biggest things that they have.  Bipolar?  I mean, she likes two poles, neither of which is yours.  Luckily, my two kids are mine.  She's addicted to dick.  Oh, my God.  Are they beautiful?  She's got a dick addiction, bro.  What is his addiction?  To be with somebody that just puts you through that?  Yeah.  Boy, you've got to really like getting the shit beat out of yourself.  Now, when we were dating, I went out with about a dozen girls because I knew she was 
[02:56:00]  screwing around.  I couldn't meet anybody that quite did for me what she did.  She fucked you well?  Is that what it was?  Even with her walking all over me, somehow this marriage has stayed together.  Sir, is she a great lay?  Huh?  Is she a great lay?  I mean, is that what keeps you?  I'd say she's about a seven on a one to ten scale.  She gives one mean blowjob, and she's swallowed me.  Yeah, she does.  She's had a lot of practice.  Of course.  I'm sorry.  She's a little nine yard.  You know, she's toys. 
[02:56:30]  She'll play with herself for me.  Whatever I want, she'll do.  But Keith, how does she tell you that she's been with all these guys?  How do you know that it's 21 guys?  After each one, she tells you?  We had a real long talk about two years ago, and I told her.  I said, I always knew I thought it was 30, and I told her.  I said, you know what?  Just to clear up the air, because she's known what I did while we were dating, and I told  her.  I said, I want to know the truth.  How many was there when we were dating?  How many in the first couple of years we were married? 
[02:57:00]  That's a loaded question, man.  14 years where there was no affairs, and then just this last one four years ago, that was  the destroyer, because I had a 10-month-old daughter when she decided to go bang her ex-boyfriend, and that's the one that made me a freaking basket case.  But 14 years of nothing, I mean, there's a lot of guys.  Was she just lining them up outside the house when you were gone?  I mean, I just don't understand.  See, this is, Jim, this is a great example of a guy that completely accepts the clown suit.  Yes, he does.  I mean, it must get a kick out of it somehow. 
[02:57:30]  You've got to be getting something out of this, because, you know, I mean, to be that guy,  to be that much of a martyr, and to let that humiliation continue on.  And not only does he accept the clown suit, but his ringtone is, ba-ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  And then he answers it, and she goes, I'm fucking someone right now.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  No, she was never that black.  Everyone knows.  She always tried to keep it a secret.  But I wear my pain externally.  My face is pierced, nose is pierced, nipples pierced.  Tattoos all over my arm. 
[02:58:00]  It's justâ€”  You know what's next?  That pain makes me feel better.  Yeah, clearly you're a masochist.  I think that maybe on your anniversary, she'd have her nail you to a fucking cross.  i feel like i have been crucified i've actually used that word to her i said you've crucified  me in this goddamn relationship yeah i'm not happy that she did it i mean no you said you  like to live with her yeah something you like something there's something about this you like  something did she actually believe it or not the only reason why i stuck with her through it all 
[02:58:30]  i actually love the person i'm married to even with all that baggage i truly on some level even  though i'm a mess now i still do love the one have you tried have you tried sexualizing this dynamic  do you let her uh whip you or anything like that yeah no no i'm done she's let me do a little bit  of that light you know lightly to her how many uh how many hookers have you killed because all  no actually i haven't i've not how what's the word i'm looking for i kind of like the idea of being 
[02:59:00]  the upstanding one in this so literally since i took my vows i haven't screwed around even though i've  had probably six or seven good opportunities because i like the idea that i've got something  on her that she doesn't that's it i held up my vows and you didn't that's it so yeah so you get you  get the righteousness so you get that's it righteous i feel righteous right because i did  till death do us part no other women i did what i said let me ask you something do you do you uh do  you torture her a bit like you know are you passive aggressive do you go out of your way to to say well 
[02:59:30]  you did this you did that in conversation and mark oh yeah as a matter of fact it i'm i'm trying  to back off from it because it's it's getting to the point where i'm i'm tearing her up and i can  see it i don't really at this point want to destroy her because she has become another person thanks to  that's what you get off on the bipolar medication that's the buzz though that's the buzz that's what  you that's what you get off on is that control thing yeah at this point well i didn't have control  over before but since i've taken the opposite stance i took control of the money i took control 
[03:00:00]  my own life i got my balls back the whole nine yards instead of surrendering myself to her i'm  in control and yeah i for the last four years i have gotten off on the boy did you fuck up yeah  uh by the way uh speaking about the clown suit that these guys have been referring to all morning  long matt from queensbury writes uh clown suit shit this fucking guy rides a unicycle for work  for christ's sake he's got fucking elephant shit under his shoes i've got a few regrets but

[03:06:30]  looks at me says she was cheating on me i was like you tell me this now i just pick up and drop  around a fucking bare ass right on the goddamn floor okay and uh i mean we were together for  five and a half years got married six months later i came home to a dear john letter started all of it  man well that's uh that's a strange way to find out yeah yeah and um she just denies it to this day  and everything and the worst thing is i still have feelings for and i something about her that i love so  much and everything and it still pops back in my mind every once in a while yeah i know that feeling 
[03:07:00]  it's just go away completely yeah it's hard to it's it's really hard to to kill the love that you  have for somebody and the only yeah you're just gonna have to process the feelings man oh listen  i'm dr phil now yeah right my friends came over they were asking about shuttle launch i was down  in florida one time and i was showing them pictures of shuttle launch and there's pictures of my ex-wife  right there and everything just started me thinking again it's like god damn it why the hell did i  bother bringing that up yeah yeah yeah all right bro dr phil is such a douche i i there's he's he's 
[03:07:30]  like uh i don't even watch where i would know that he's a douche no i don't i don't watch either but  he's shilling for some uh a flower company and i hear the commercials when i'm driving in  and they go and now we have dr phil or it's not even a flower company i think it's a dating company  that's what it is it's one of those computer dating things and he goes and now we have dr phil  and he goes it's okay to feel good about you and i was like i go what out loud i'm in my truck going 
[03:08:00]  what the fuck does that mean what in the fuck does that even mean dr philly just comes up with these  catchphrases that's it it's great to know your shoes are yours yeah like what dr phil why and it's  the way he says it he's so like passionate about it and you just go wait feel good about me usually  if i feel good about me that precedes suicidal thoughts there's something so troubling it's like 
[03:08:30]  yeah i'm okay it's like oh god i want to kill myself it's got to be a problem yeah we got to start  taping dr phil i gotta hear some of these now it's just these catchphrases that he thinks he's  gonna like cure somebody you can like your hair yeah oh i can oh good throw away my fucking psycho  drugs and i'll stop seeing a therapist and everything will be fine because dr phil says my hair's okay  but i'll tell you i think that a lot of people ultimately this is the scary thing about drug 
[03:09:00]  companies is that i think a lot of people who are on on medication for depression they're they  shouldn't be on the medication they're making up diseases you know that you know if you read the  symptoms of any psychological disease you know there's 50 of them you're gonna have three you  know you read that list you know do you feel hopeless yeah do you do you uh do you have suicidal thoughts  yeah are you uncomfortable with sushi you know i am a little bit do you sing in your car holy  fuck i do sing in my car i need this medicine but i i think that in most cases in terms of depression  look it's not easy for anybody and the only difference between depression and disappointment 
[03:09:30]  is your level of commitment so just keep that in mind i think i i you gotta wonder if people were  um like uh you had a higher suicide rate uh in the early days before all these uh antidepressants  or now well some people are really really sick and really need that work but they did they try to  make people feel sick sicker you know that these companies and they're very powerful like it's like  i think other people have talked about that but you know when you saw when zoloft was an antidepressant 
[03:10:00]  then all of a sudden that you see these signs on the subway says zoloft now treats social anxiety  disorder what the fuck is that shyness yeah yeah that they just like now you got you got nervous  leg disorder i mean would you be stupid yeah the uh the uh they got a stockpile of these drugs they're  like what else does it do what else you know put it on a poster yeah it also treats that thing that  you do if you lick your lips when they're dry so if you have that problem where your lips get dry and  you use your tongue you probably need these pills how did it get to the point where like every show you 
[03:10:30]  watch there's a drug right there as you're talking see you're just well now it's active  which makes your poopies a little better but by drug commercials like when did that start  growing up i don't remember seeing anything but you know maybe an aspirin commercial baby aspirin  barry bayer aspirin used to have uh bayer aspirin actually used to have um well no it wasn't bayer  aspirin but heroin the word heroin was actually a brand name for an over-the-counter medication 
[03:11:00]  really yeah in the early 1900s if i'm not mistaken there's got to be someone out there right now i  don't think so mark maron kick kick kick kick well you of course you remember the aids diet plan  where you had the chocolate candies named aids can we play that commercial for more they  yeah change gears a little bit here it really uh my mother had those yeah oh yeah my mother had aids  too yeah i ate anthony's anthony's mom had a lot of aids i would eat her aids and she would get mad  at me i would eat her aids too that's not regular candy oh stop it here's the commercial 
[03:11:30]  i was overweight and embarrassed to go any place aids helped me get back into a size 12.  i bet the aids diet plan helped me get back into a size six aids helps control your appetite so you  lose weight yet aids lets you taste chew and enjoy and the appetite suppressant in aids is not a stimulant  it helped me lose the weight it has nothing in it that could make me nervous question why take diet  pills when you can enjoy aids aids helps you lose weight safely and effectively use only as directed  it sounds like an snl skit where'd you get that it's it's a real commercial but i know it is 
[03:12:00]  where go to youtube the old internet yeah youtube got everything on it find everything now they never  should have taken that product off the market they should have pushed it through every time  fucking somebody dropped dead they should have said another plug right  right fucking why not i just watch the stock plummet and do nothing about it yeah stock selling at a  penny uh hey uh let's change gears we got a phantom shitter this is this is a really 
[03:12:30]  fucked up story it's pretty funny it's the story of the day i do believe it's not hard to go outside  and get a breath of fresh air but one local neighborhood can barely breathe because of a  disgusting gross vile stench in the air channel three i witness how much do you hate the news mark  i gotta interrupt right away i tell you i it's a dumb shit story and they have to you know milk it i  haven't they have disconnected from so much shit because i'm just very busy with uh you know well  we watch very self-centered these days at this point the chaos of my life it should be at this point 
[03:13:00]  we watch local news before we get ready for our show because it's it's a comedy show it does it is  comedy it's not a news anymore we're watching uh the news here it's a channel 11 has the the local  news here in new york and um on friday now remember it's the news yeah they do dance friday where the  weather and traffic girl and some i guess interns they get out there and start dancing and the anchor is 
[03:13:30]  like laughing and i'm like aren't there people being blown up uh in iraq that's a downer that's  that's that's hardcore yeah i i know i was watching anderson cooper i mean interrupt but  on a serious note on a serious note like i'm watching they did like a whole last week on cnn  they're talking about how in afghanistan they're they're gonna defoliate the poppies the opium poppies  right and there was an issue with karzai he says i don't want to defoliate because it'll ruin 
[03:14:00]  other crops and but other crops right but but and anderson cooper's out there with the people  that are cutting down these poppies with machetes and then you know here's the weird thing that's  that's not a fucking story all right the truth of matter is it's a three billion dollar a year  industry all right so obviously there's a glut there's a heroin glut and and then the then you see  that this the third paragraph in military uh officials and intelligence officials uh don't  want to defoliate either because if things is going to give the taliban propaganda against american 
[03:14:30]  chemicals and i'm like if that's not a red flag right there it's like the real question is how  the fuck is three billion dollars worth of heroin getting out of afghanistan how it how did it get  out in vietnam it got out on military carriers it got out through the cia so that's the real story  but he's out in the field cutting down poppies you know with with with opium farmers but no one's  saying like where is it going yeah how the fuck right how is it you know obviously there's a glutton  they've got a stock they've got back stock so now they can do a little political theater make it look like  they're doing something so they can move the shit they got in the storeroom and make everybody think 
[03:15:00]  they're doing something i mean the real story is is that the black market is more powerful than  the regular market and the people that are involved are you know the same people that always were  involved the cia the government black ops you know the how come i don't think i think the government  is looking out for my interest your best interest how come uh they're always talking about um our our  security as far as shipping goes especially the shipping containers and and uh drugs can make it 
[03:15:30]  in in giant quantities oh hell yeah it's not it's not one mexican uh fucking squirreling a balloon of  heroin up his ass at a time it's like there are giant oh yeah shipping containers of drugs making it over  here how come those can make it over but like uh a a dirty bomb it doesn't make it over it's a  fucking lie it's like so someone's got to be letting it in letting the drugs in yeah and trying to keep 
[03:16:00]  out like the bad guys and i'll tell you when they want to the same people that let 9-11 happen will let  a bomb in see now you're going a little far i knew i'm sorry here we are in air america would  fork off a little right we were we were agreeing no no no no no i i i i'm being a little let's get  the poopy story on the air i just watched zeitgeist movie have you watched that uh no oh dude dude i  mean i'm i'm not a conspiracy guy because my brain will go there and i'm really not that guy yeah but  i watch that movie online it someone sent me the link zeitgeistmovie.com all right and it's it's it's 
[03:16:30]  amazing what it does because you know i'm at the 9-11 true thing the last thing i want to be  is one of those guys at every conversation you have with anybody you know let's go get something  to eat what about tower 11 yeah what about tower seven seven i just want to get something to eat  but tower seven it looked like it imploded you know dude you're gonna have to it's like i understand it  you want to be a independent speculative investigator go ahead but you know keep it as a hobby and and if  you find the truth because god knows how how much thank god the conspiracy uh people uh solve the 
[03:17:00]  kennedy thing because i'm glad we got closure on that yeah yeah that's finally over and no one's  talking about it anymore but here's what happens just to say quickly now it is beginning to look  like oswald uh was the only shooter it's like it is actually turning around where the technology is  almost proving that a lot of the conspiracy stuff was nonsensical but that's it but you got people  the thing is is that conspiracy thinking and i didn't mean to shift from poop but i like it  i mean this is but but this is just the thing is is about conspiracy here's my whole bag with this 
[03:17:30]  is that you're no different than a born-again christian if you're a conspiracy theorist because  it's the same type of belief it's fanatical and it's based on on speculation like if you're  a born-again christian and someone goes hey you know i don't think you know there's really no  indication that jesus ever existed it's like okay you want to live in the dark that's fine i'll pray for  you now and with a conspiracy theorist they find a series of dogma that they believe in that can't  necessarily be proven you're like i don't know i i think it might have just happened the way they  said it's like okay you want to live in the dark i'll pray for you know i think that if jesus came 
[03:18:00]  down from the earth from from the sky and the only thing he said to the entire planet was oswald worked  alone there would be people on the ground going what the fuck does that guy know he lives in the  sky you know he didn't know anything i'm down here doing my homework i'm reading an excellent book by f uh  by uh bugliosi uh vincent who wrote who uh was uh prosecuted manson and he's a he's it's like a  1300 page book he said debunking all the conspiracy things and he raises one great point in the very 
[03:18:30]  beginning he says that the reason the conspiracy theorists are so much uh uh more listened to he goes they  have the more interesting story yeah that's a more interesting thing to sink your teeth into  they got it all figured out every conspiracy is more interesting than what really happened no one  likes to believe that 9 11 we got caught with our pants down and uh uh some fanatics were able to  hijack planes and crash them into buildings they like that the wow they wired it for uh to demolish the 
[03:19:00]  building when meanwhile if you've ever watched a show on how they demolish buildings it takes months of  preparation they have to gut the building they got to drill into a fucking cement beams while people  are all working in their office yeah uh is is madge looking over his shoulder wondering why there's a  dynamite you can't get a friend uh past the security guy it's a front desk it's a lousy friend like  oh jesus dynamite sign in show ids and then hey but it's a more interesting story but it also feeds into a 
[03:19:30]  a sort of a victim sort of injustice ideology and the thing that i always say to him is like okay if there  are questions and you want to investigate the questions you go ahead but you make it a hobby  because you know in terms of making honest to god change within the government like we were talking  about before patriot act that kind of stuff that requires some attention some you know talking to  your representatives from actually getting involved with the slow process of government as opposed to  saying i know the truth you're living in the dark i mean there's a power to it there's a righteousness  to it and that movie man it starts off like it spends 15 minutes deconstructing the myth of jesus 
[03:20:00]  all right historically it says that there was a lot of other belief systems that had similar  stories about the sun god it coincides with astrology his history says that he might not  have even existed and you really buy it it's history and it's the middle east and it's you know  it's bc and after his death and and you're like wow this is really informative then it cuts to bam out of  nowhere planes flying into the tower bam now that we got you open here's another lie you know and then it  goes into that it kind of slips it in and and and given that i'm kind of vulnerable and my life is 
[03:20:30]  out of control i'm very susceptible to knowing the truth in a broad stroking way about very big  unsolvable things so i'm a little polluted with it right now and people also don't like the  helplessness there's an empowerment in thinking the government did it because it's something i can wrap  my mind around it's very difficult like he said to to realize that just yeah it is what it is a nut  probably destroyed what would have been this amazing beloved american president i mean like  this this guy who was going to change the world was taken out by a nut and people don't like to 
[03:21:00]  accept that because it's just too ugly and small it's too random it's just too unpredictable yeah  i'm but the government conspiracy is almost like i mean i'm saying it's almost like you've built this  thing around it that can be deconstructed and figured out and fixed some nut yeah it's so huge  yeah i got lost on beloved american president i guess i'm saying jfk was so loved i thought you're  talking about bush i'm like no it's the same guy hey a couple things we got the heroin bottle on  the screen there loved there it is there heroin heroin see they used to say company heroin and what 
[03:21:30]  were heroin that would be so great on the lower east side right now they could just go in if it  was packaged like that at the bodegas as opposed to having names like pussy or tango and cash  it's uh it's actually better written in the film they are heroin bottle what was it though  probably a pain relief of some sort of what do you mean what was it was breakfast wonderful that's  why they took it off the market it was breakfast lunch and dinner wow you got a lot of people going 
[03:22:00]  yeah man honestly heroin even negroes can take it look at that old bottle well that's when they  made it illegal and then they switched the market this is how we can kill them with heroin  bear heroin man that's uh all right let's get the poop story out of the way because if we start  to get rid of your headache then the listeners go where the hell happened what happened to the poop  oh god forbid we don't get to a shit story from global chaos and conspiracy thinking to something  we all understand well poopy jokes we can all get into a poopy joke i'm in i'm in let's do the poop 
[03:22:30]  always funny just listen to the stupid anchors i love how they have to fluff up everything and just  i don't know not hard to go outside and get a breath of fresh air but one local neighborhood  can barely breathe because of a disgusting gross vile stench in the air middle three eyewitness news  reporter mary spitzel has the skin jolynn that's right i wanted to see what all this stink was about  now i do have to warn you what i found was disgusting so if you have a queasy stomach you might want to look 
[03:23:00]  away during parts of this yeah like every morning when you're taking a squat just out back of one  idaho falls neighborhood if the wind blows the right direction it yeah you can smell it through  our back door i'd like to catch the person no i think it's disgusting and you should be put in jail  so some guy's shitting everywhere yeah it's a guy that's just taking a dump  a guy who's shitting and these people have dogs they live with you know with factories they're on the  highway every day sucking exhaust into their mouths but please stop the clock someone's pooping in 
[03:23:30]  public there's a guy shitting and it's making enough stink what is he fucking shitting rhino  piles he's a dinosaur yeah he's just shitting all over an idaho uh town but we got more to the story  here here's the scoop on the poop the city has gotten so many calls about the phantom pooper they've  set up a pooper stakeout to see if they could catch him doing his business but from what i understand  they still haven't caught him yet even though they've they've staked out the area and sat and watched  they still haven't caught up with him here are the clues to the phantom pooper's identity 
[03:24:00]  as we know them his preferential place to leave a log is under the lindsay boulevard overpass  he fancies himself a bit of a rembrandt you know i don't know why they want to  finger paint with it but you know uh you know leave their mark and go he does leave his mark  and he certainly goes and goes and goes come on this is from the onion it's gonna be a homeless  guy this is real and uh when they were talking about him being a rembrandt and finger painting 
[03:24:30]  they had on the screen a shot of like i guess he had he had like airbrushed kind of like onto like a  pillar and they're just showing you that like splattered yeah and like it was it was hysterical to me  because uh the video clip you know how every video clip has to have some kind of uh picture to  represent the video clip sure so instead of it being the anchor it has something to do with the  story so this in this particular uh clip it was just the shit stain that was that was on the pillar 
[03:25:00]  as the identifying uh picture this is a metaphor for all news this is exactly what all news yeah  wait if someone comes to theory about maybe there's a pooper cell it's maybe five guys  uh the last part of the story you gotta go you gotta go you know i mean okay once you know if you  have an accident once an accident this has happened several times accident you know a little while in 
[03:25:30]  advance i mean hello bathrooms and toilet tissue are not a new concept they've been around for a while  now i must tell you that in addition to the stakeouts the city has been cleaning  up this mess whenever it happens and the neighbors we spoke with have offered their facilities but  until the phantom takes them up on the offer i guess they'll just have to deal with the situation  with a little bathroom humor all right someone's saying this is on the line this can't be real it  can't be real uh john dc oh hey oh hey what's going on hey what's up hi little jimmy hey buddy 
[03:26:00]  hey guys i'm a uh i'm a tv photog down in uh dc and i've been listening to that uh  shit story yeah there's no way that reporter track is real reporter would never say leave a log  leave a log kind of yeah that i don't know about that maybe no there's no way that was my contribution  i don't know about that maybe but it's on right it's on bright part everything on bright part is  really but the news business is ridiculous now it's k-i-d-k-3 thank you i got but uh 
[03:26:30]  how much is the guy pooping i mean i mean it's like how small of a town is it that that it's really  making this much of an impact there's an overpass guy's probably a homeless guy apparently the one  homeless guy in this town who they want to lay this on so that what they're doing is they're setting up  for the one homeless guy there's there's dog shit and there's horse shit everywhere and they're like  let's pin it on one guy and solve this shit problem to set up see i'm conspiracy i'm telling you yeah 
[03:27:00]  conspiracy well then jack ruby threw a log at him once they arrest him and then he took one in the face  oh yeah this is like this is any underpass in in the city yeah guys what is that that's homeless  garbage that's just uh look at this lady that's a fat lady yeah that makes sense this is a town full  of of of uh coprophiles they're just fascinated with who the hell does that that can't be  shit come on that's just that guy would be dead look look lower his probably his intestines are on 
[03:27:30]  the ground that was a spleen a colon on the floor market edison writes uh when they catch up with this  guy he'll be up shit's creek bang oh hey i'll be here all weekend thank you that's one of those things  where it seems to me maybe some uh guys are in a car they've been partying some guy goes dude i  gotta take a shit really bad pulls over and makes his friends laugh by bending over and spraying that  pillar like that would make a carload of your friends just laugh their balls off showing this 
[03:28:00]  one pillar i mean is that is that really that important a location in this town like you know  now no one can go under the bridge yeah and dine by the pillar which is a popular hot spot  and and i don't see any how is it what's smelling why is this a story and who found it i mean what  i'd like to report a shitting yeah a couple of people would go fuck under the bridge like we  can't even go there anymore there's our one place phantom pooper hey mark this is not a story  surveillance you're just gonna throw it into that yeah let's go well that well you know they're 
[03:28:30]  fighting it out in in in the congress and the democrats are buckling and they're this whole patriot  act idea is the the thing i and i was talking we were talking before is that look you the the  idea that the government can do an unwarranted search of or tap our phones or search our hard  drives it's just fucking bullshit it's ridiculous on any level no matter what the reason it's  unconstitutional and and i you know and i cannot stand and we're talking about this before i can't  stand people that that that that defend the policy by saying hey if you got nothing to hide you got 
[03:29:00]  nothing to worry about because the bottom line is honestly i got nothing to hide but i got a few  things i'm ashamed of and uh i'd almost rather be caught with a bomb yeah i could explain that you  know what i mean it's like what were you doing with that bomb i was gonna blow some shit up with  it but if they were to download some of the stuff on my hard drive i would be hard-pressed to explain  some of that you know what are you gonna say like i didn't know it was a guy at first you know  and i just kept looking at it because it was weird am i in trouble yeah what do you want me to do  well the surveillance people talk about in the street a lot of people are saying there's too much  surveillance there's no privacy walking the streets but uh it's like they've used a lot of that footage 
[03:29:30]  to actually catch criminals and catch violent criminals but like i'm talking about the stuff  that's out in public but i can't see where an ordinary citizen is ever going to be bothered  or affected negatively by just being filmed walking down the street rand i i don't see where that's  right now though but the idea that we're talking about though is that if they can do that if they  can tap our phones and they can and they can look at your hard drives without you knowing it okay  let's say that's the deal yeah well that well that's what i'm talking about surveillance cameras that  are they're set up in buildings or even by cities you know i i i understand that it makes me 
[03:30:00]  uncomfortable but again it just a lot of people believe that it's making them safe when really  they don't know when they're going to be the other end of that and what i was saying to him was that  if the administration changes and the law is in place that let's say some religious fanatic becomes  president and decides that okay we're not looking for terrorists we're looking for the guy jerking off  the trannies and those are going to be the guys that we're going to put in prison because we decided  that that means the law is on the books and there's no way to fight it that they can just  change the focus of their thing that's usually what happens absolutely and i think that's going 
[03:30:30]  to be a way that i i actually had this idea that they're going to use it to they're going to use porn  recruiting that the the military is in dire straits they can't get people to join up so what's going  to happen is the government's going to search what people are looking at what they're going to call  a kid who's 25 and they're going to say yeah it's the u.s government have you ever thought about  joining the marines like no i don't want to be in the military well we know what you're watching right now  and if you don't want to tell your mother or your wife maybe you should reconsider so there  actually be a way to blackmail people into certain things to doing maybe i'm being paranoid but i'm 
[03:31:00]  just saying once something's on the books it don't matter who's in charge based on past performance i  don't think you're being paranoid because a lot of times something sounds great it's always presented  as a protection we're protecting you it's very convenient yeah this is a good thing for you  instead of a right being taken away right we're going to put a chip in your head so everyone in your  family knows where you are you won't have you won't need money because we'll have your bank  account on the chip that sounds good and if you go into debt we're gonna you know we're gonna have  you uh taken out there's gonna be a self-exploring chip in your head because they're doing that with 
[03:31:30]  cars they got this uh this g-star thing that if someone steals your car they'll slow the car down  yeah and it's only it's very short jump to having a chip in your head you're like this is a great idea  because now i won't get lost because i don't know where i'm going and you know so and your family knows  where you are but everyone else knows where you are and then if you're in trouble that's the thing is that if you've got a  v-chip in you'll be robbing a bank you're just going you know they can yeah go look what he's up  to it's an aneurysm let's short him out and people think that's to protect them it's so they know where 
[03:32:00]  their kids are but have there been cases like it might be might be very very there may be some where  that type of stuff has really come back to bite us they've used uh supposed anti-terrorist laws laws  that were put in place uh uh actually laws that were uh freedoms that were taken away wiretapping things  like that right that is presented to protect us from terrorism that has already been used against  um uh the mob gangs uh drug dealers i'm not saying this is i'm not saying this about things they're 
[03:32:30]  not even lumping them in with terrorists they're just able to do this now or classifying gangs as  terrorism like that like they're classifying them as terrorists yeah they can then use it but they can  use it on you as well yeah for whatever the thing the thing is is that it once this gets down to local  law enforcement or once once these freedoms are diminished once you they can they can legally say  that you don't get to make a phone call that your habeas corpus rights are suspended for whatever  reason once it's on the books any law enforcement agency can say we can do this yeah so if you say 
[03:33:00]  something shitty on stage let's say you know you say something that's provocative in a way that that is  questionable for whatever reason why the hell can't they haul you in why the hell can't they say you don't get  representation and why the hell can't they keep you in the in the pokey for three months under  suspicion if you don't have those protections in place and you didn't fucking do anything  it could it doesn't have to be specific it could be anybody that i mean that's a scary thing and a  lot of us think like well i got nothing to hide well a lot of people don't a lot of these poor bastards  that were whether we're corralled up even on terrorist suspicion may not have anything to do with anything 
[03:33:30]  and they're they have no legal recourse so the problem isn't necessarily the law it's the perversion  of it like if they're using it legitimately like like let's say if they take something like that  and they use it completely legitimately honestly going after guys who they really think are doing  stuff and they have good reason to believe like going after like you know certain they can do that  legally but i mean even without even the legality i'm saying honestly going after uh where where they  really think it's a source of terrorism the terrorism that we're all we as common people know we're 
[03:34:00]  talking but there are protections in place so the fisa laws and there are other laws in place that there's  no reason they can't get a warrant there's no reason that they can't investigate these people  without saying that without taking civil liberties away but don't they have to not my only thing is  this like there's certain things like they blew the uh they blew it recently where they where they  announced that they had this video of bin laden like they gave up there are certain things that you  do covertly and i'm not talking about invading americans computers but there are certain things you  have to do covertly to protect the fact that you really are going after legitimate but that's a funny 
[03:34:30]  example because that's an example of the government outsourcing these jobs and taking them out of the  government and using secondary agencies that was a secondary agency that was on the payroll is a  security agency that had this relationship that was enabling them to get stuff from al-qaeda this was  a subcontracted thing this was what was within the government so they get this thing and the  government says give us the tape and the guys are like this is a second there's not a government  agency somebody's being paid by the government and they said look don't release it because you know  you're going to compromise our rat and then the government like immediately released it so now this this 
[03:35:00]  independent agency that has no legal recourse and they're trying to to do what this government  wants which is outsource everything to non-governmental agencies because they think that's a better way  to do it so the government looks why they leak the tape that's just stupid because they don't give a  shit and they they thought we got something here and it was an underling and they they processed the  tape and now this company that was working legitimately like you were saying probably maybe even beyond the  law because that's why they subcontract that's why they use people like like blackwater and here the  the dumb government you know went ahead and and compromised the whole situation didn't they used 
[03:35:30]  to just be called mercenaries back in the good old days oh man that whole thing is just creepy  and they they and their their leader has a christian agenda the scary thing is is that when you got  that situation where like iraq wants black water out and they're they're bastards and they're they're  walking beyond above the wall they make some great videos uh you have watch them on youtube or break  they will use their helicopters and just scare the living shit out of people on the ground for no apparent  reason it's like a bunch of drunks got helicopters and they and guns and they're just having a pisser 
[03:36:00]  over uh iraq but this but this compromises the the military too this is one that i talked to a guy  on the phone once who said there was a time where you know the reason why the military functioned and  why we were proud to be part of it is that you know we were the guys there everyone was on the ground  doing the same job we weren't there like wondering who the hell that who's that guy with a machine gun  they've subcontracted people for a war like the war is a business venture it always was a business  yeah but now you look back like like you watched ken burns the war right watch that documentary and you 
[03:36:30]  see uh americans now we might have been a little naive back then but you see americans knowing that  they had to fight hitler and uh the japs and and and whatever the hell else uh the italians this was  something that had to be done to protect the united states from uh tyranny yeah and they went in  droves i mean you saw people at the recruiting office in fucking lines going down the blocks 
[03:37:00]  that's right and they they were all on the same team and they all and they all had jobs they weren't  hiring outside catering agencies contracted people you didn't see a mcdonald's or or something  on a base right you know it was it's a great example of why you know this the the sweetheart  deals that the administrations make is diminishing the morale of america in the sense that if we have  a collective purpose there and it's legitimate then they should engage the military in a way that makes  them feel like it's a legitimate purpose but not unlike vietnam you got guys over there and now it's 
[03:37:30]  like you know what the fuck is this what the fuck are we still doing here and really what are we doing  here i don't even understand anymore this is there's i don't know who the enemy is i don't know you  know whose side we're on now they're you know there's money going to both sides from the u.s  government to maintain a certain amount of divide and conquer chaos so they can continue to uh to  pilfer i really believe that these guys these neocon guys wanted to just bankrupt the country  and and ultimately that would then privatize everything all social services right so that'll 
[03:38:00]  make the chasm between rich and poor so extreme that in a few years they'll be able to recruit for  the military just by saying hungry need a place to sleep and there's a couple uh there's a feedbacks  coming in you know talking about how they would uh recruit for the military by looking at your hard  drive uh you got florida steve writing uh will i go to jail for a shithat video and then you got bill  k from philly hey holy shit i'm gonna be forced to serve in the military i'm 35 years old i'm i'm not  too old to jerk off but i'm too old to serve yeah did you ever have you ever put something in a search 
[03:38:30]  engine that you were afraid of because you hear like oh there might be keywords or something like  i've wanted to search for uh things about al-qaeda and terrorists and maybe uh another guy a terrorist  that gets killed right and you want to do a little background on what he did so you're putting his name  in there and you're thinking you know what the fuck do i know where this is going before it gets to  the server and you know is somebody kind of keeping tabs on keywords because you hear that all the time 
[03:39:00]  it throws up a red flag and what does this guy do you try to buffer it by putting al-qaeda trannies  just so they don't know what you really do you got a few choices yeah it's just that's what gets me  a little uh frightened about the whole no warrant thing that's it but that's exactly right if if  somebody wants to just check out what you're searching for on your computer more so the red flag  believe me if you're listening to my phone call you're gonna be a bored motherfucker well that's yeah  yeah that's right they're they're obviously using underwings and they're testing them like 
[03:39:30]  they're getting practice yeah but as far as the computer goes that is like your knowledge base  so if i want to learn about something no matter how uh how the government might see it as as being  something they don't want us to know about or or maybe they see me looking a little too closely into  al-qaeda and what they're about or the taliban will they check me out will they be looking a little  closer into what i do that's a good question how much leeway do they have and this i honestly don't  know the answer i might not either be um when they're doing a warrantless search like uh like 
[03:40:00]  like say like obviously supposed to be in the case of there's no time to get a warrant or we really need  to do this what what is the leeway they have on having to justify why they did it it's foreign phone  calls yeah the phone calls have to be international i think is is is part of it that they can't they  can't manufacture enough warrants i don't believe is a deal to to tap it's usually international  calls is what they're really concerned with in terms of the hard drive i don't know what that is  and then there's a question about you know a lot of servers are international so that's right that 
[03:40:30]  be considered international i think that's it and do they have to justify it that's a quick  i someone told me once well there's a myth about the patriot act where they can just do what they  want they always someone and again this could have been wrong info so they have to show cause as  to why they did it and you do have to act like it's a warrant but you just do it uh  to show cause i don't know if i'm right or wrong but wouldn't it be cause enough if you're doing  a search on al-qaeda wouldn't it be cause enough if you're calling your friend in iran i mean i mean  that seems like if you're going to really broad stroke it that's cause the only way they have to 
[03:41:00]  sell it but the only way uh the government would have to sell it is we're protecting you don't worry  and if it's just for your knowledge and education we'll know about it it's okay  like that's getting gets me like well the advertisers already the advertisers you know  that there's a certain amount of information going out by the emails i get uh they that kind of  like what i've been doing online i will start getting emails about exactly okay so now someone 
[03:41:30]  knows what you're doing i go out i said let's say you buy a car all of a sudden uh you're getting  shit in your email about the car you bought and and you know accessories and shit like that when  you didn't give out your fucking email address or if you're searching certain things you're looking  for merchandise or stereo equipment or whatever uh uh like camcorders i'm i'm i'm really into  fucking video yeah so i'm buying a camcorder i buy a camcorder all of a sudden i'm getting junk mail  about cameras and oh yeah they've got they've got niche marketing down to the to it's such a fine 
[03:42:00]  focus that you can be a niche market yeah it's not you and five other people or a hundred people that  because of the information that we surrender see that that's my biggest fear about technology is that  there was a time and i've talked about this before i mean there was a time where you know  where we didn't have cell phones there was a time where you actually remembered a few phone numbers  you know i mean and now if you would ask me mine on on a bad day i'd be hard pressed to remember  i had to check my phone i really think that some people if you lost your cell phone you're a 
[03:42:30]  blackberry i mean you're two hours away from digging through garbage wandering the street  what's my name where do i live do i have a job i think i work someplace  everything will break down and then with the computer and the thing is it's not a convenience  this is one of those great examples how you presented this technology it's going to make us  advanced but it's making us fucking retarded because you can bank online you don't have to  remember anything you can google you don't have to you know you don't have to do it you know you can  you can shop online never have to leave your house you don't have to think and what are we 
[03:43:00]  doing with all that freed up space no one americans not fucking much we're just creating a blank screen  so they can dangle more shiny shit in front of us like yes i want that it's like we have an infant  mind now because of this shit we're so prone to immediate gratification like i can't even wait  online at a coffee shop i'm in i'm in scotland okay i'm in scotland and they're doing things the old  way which is like you know talking online and you're taking their time making the coffee and i'm  waiting three minutes i'm like what come on you know and and that's the way we think is that  everything is immediate gratification nothing demands any reflection nothing has any context 
[03:43:30]  no one knows about history anymore it's just a series of pictures that they can download and  go to wikipedia and i think honestly it's it's all very ornate it's all very elaborate you need a lot  of passwords but but that's all we know anymore and outside of that i think we're we're fundamentally  retarded that's a great fucking point because we become so dependent goddamn dependent on machine on the uh  the cell phones and computers to remember our shit and you feel like you got to keep up if  there's a new phone like it took me a while to get a phone to text because my wife got one i'm like i 
[03:44:00]  don't fucking need to text and then she'd send me a text you need to text yeah because and then i  pick out my phone i might as well have a hammer and chisel and stone tablet clink clink clink eye  there's a bird in there going it's a living yeah exactly that's the fear with any technology too though  because don't forget like electricity comes along i mean it's the it's the most amazing invention and then  we are all slaves to electricity so it's like no matter what great thing that comes along that's  going to be helpful you can't live without it yeah yeah but never before did it require that we 
[03:44:30]  surrender our intelligence you know out of the name of convenience i mean there are people that  aren't capable of thinking something through just you know even you know like there is like  that's why you know jeopardy is so popular is that you know apparently there are people in the world  that remember shit yeah i i'm not necessarily one of them i think i i used to i used to be one of  them but i don't think i'm one of them anymore and it's frightening because once like i lost my  blackberry for two hours literally the panic was was so deep and so weird because like everything's 
[03:45:00]  on that i lost my phone for a day and you feel stranded freaking out but you got to keep up with  the new phone if you lost your planner 10 years ago you would have freaked out like if i lost my  planner a few years ago where all my gigs were in it and all my phone numbers i never remembered 500  numbers i'm there might be a few i don't remember but i mean i never remembered all  that i'm talking where you remember okay but if you lost your computer right now with the  shit that's on there sure like you know credit card information all that information it's almost like  you're losing your personality you're losing your your your identity that that that in the hands 
[03:45:30]  of somebody else and and all the information that's in there oh you're writing i mean it's more  than just a sure sure of course i mean it's in a way like having your home robbed or or losing your  wallet times ten but i mean we've always had these things it's like the computer i think is a  great thing that my problem is unfortunately i'm an addict so i fucking pervert it but i also i love  when i see a guy like louis ck who's a great example of taking a computer and using it for  really what it's supposed to be used for he makes me sick he's but he grew up with it you 
[03:46:00]  know his mother was a programmer oh that's right and one time we found it was funny i was with louis  one time and there was this old beat up computer on the street and louis like let's take it up to  my apartment see what's in there so he was able to sort of revive it because he actually i think  he actually knows oh he told us about that yeah and we found like yeah we found the guy's name and  weird writing oh you're part of that yeah it was that whole story on the air yeah and he found out  all sorts of shit about we called the guy we called the guy just to see if he existed it was the  weirdest thing it was a bad one he lived in chelsea but that's odd too that people don't even they 
[03:46:30]  have these uh the computers and don't even understand what's in them and the power of it that you can put  your entire identity out on the street uh in the garbage because you don't understand that it's all  still there i can't yeah when you unplug it it's still there you would think i was a like i was in  the white house during watergate i got a shredder at home oh yeah oh yeah man now and that's another  thing yeah i got a paper shredder yeah oh yeah everything goes through there my name on it or  anything whenever a computer goes bad yeah i pull the hard drive comes out bang it with a hammer my ram 
[03:47:00]  yeah and then i'm just with a phillips head screwdriver putting holes in the fucking thing  yeah like we're like we're that important like yeah god forbid someone knows but it's just it's  like i do my banking online i do uh uh have um passwords on there yeah for all various uh uh  websites yeah that um i go to and you know you just kind of websites al-qaeda websites yeah what  did you learn about al-qaeda by the way i have wondering no i got whenever you get like one of the top 
[03:47:30]  muckety mucks yeah that are killed and then the 8 000 second in commands just need to educate  yourself a little bit yeah you want to know what's going on you're just saying where you also where  you moved up in the ranks let me tell you i'll tell you a lot of world war ii stuff so i'm looking  up a lot of nazi shit i go to uh i go to fricking sites i go to white supremacist sites i go to you  will go to black uh militant sites i go to you will be recruited blackwater is going to recruit  yeah blackwater is he's one of our guys how great he shoots guns in his basement i shot my computer 
[03:48:00]  because i was angry with it that's great i took an ar-15 and uh blew a hole through it when you  want information it's there that's the i mean it does in a way the convenience does kind of like  remove a lot of the hand-to-hand shit i used to have to do like going to the bank but you know what  like i i kind of get my bills paid on time now whereas i was the fucking you're right i'm not a  luddite you know i'm not a guy that thinks you should get rid of computers i'm just saying that  there there's an ability that people have which is you know an ability of critical thought an 
[03:48:30]  ability to connect abstract thoughts an ability to have their own opinions about things and that i  think a lot of that gets interfered because i think with convenience why would people strain to do that  it's like when you're in college why bother to write a term paper if you can go online and buy one  you know why bother to go to the library and look at books and do certain a type of research that would  engage you in a way that would sort of force you to to to interact with these things if you can do it  easier so i just think what gets lost is is a real sense of history a sense of an ability to to think 
[03:49:00]  critically for yourself an ability to figure out what's bullshit and what is yeah to figure out to  kind of exercise your mind when when when i was a kid me and my brother would you'd be watching tv and  someone would come on you go oh who is that he was from a movie i think and you would toil all day  over where the fuck did i see that what movie was that and then one of you would go like two hours  later ah he was in this movie and that was a good moment now it's like fuck who was that google  boom internet movie database okay i know his entire fucking history it's great it's educational you know 
[03:49:30]  a lot more but you you're not really working not working on your brain it's harder to only get one  side of the story now though one one thing is like the information is so available on both sides  it's yeah but it's easier to get 18 000 wrong sides that's right absolutely you have to parse through  this stuff like i think all the truth that you need to know honestly believe this like even with  the kennedy thing and everything else that the truth is out there but now it's on you to to sort  of parse through bullshit to parse through right left whatever information you want to make certain 
[03:50:00]  decisions about certain things but it but whereas i think there was a time that there were people that  did their homework there were people that were respectable voices there were people that weren't just on on  tv spin and ship for entertainment that you could sort of say i trust that guy the news is quoting  fucking blogs now there's some asshole sitting in his basement with his own opinion and the news is  saying uh this blog site is reporting and you're like what the what's your source you mean the  blog site you mean some guy in his basement alone yeah alone coming up with his own opinion on some 
[03:50:30]  shit let's see they never had they didn't they never worried about what the source was because they  used to be the guys going uh people are saying people are saying now instead of saying that they  go well this blog is reporting but it's the same same thing they want to get out now for some reason  it gets more credibility because it's on the computer and it's out there for other people to  see but also too that because like we were talking about before news agencies no longer do their jobs  they're cutting budgets it's not important so uh sometimes the guys who are on the blogs might 
[03:51:00]  actually have the story because no no one none of the major entities that are media entities are  being responsible about journalism but the majority of people i'm sorry they're too lazy  that's to go through a lot of shit to come up and formulate a real either opinion or fact about  a subject but were people smarter x amount of years ago like i'm not saying they weren't they  were but when you look like the way the news is reported for so many years on three channels  the way you were raised by your dad is and that's the way it is you know we heard on the news and 
[03:51:30]  that's the way i mean it wasn't like years ago people were thirsting for information they kind of  bought what they saw and for years it was the papers you read the paper and that was the news look at  the way they're acting yeah but at least you might have to sort through dance friday and water skiing  squirrels and there was of course but you know i'm saying it wasn't like people were always but  there were standards see that yeah the thing is is that there is a way it is and just because there's  now a million different options for how it is doesn't make it any that you know freedom of uh 
[03:52:00]  freedom is not freedom of choice in in in the sense that like it just makes it more difficult to  figure out what is because everything gets convoluted everything gets spun it's very difficult to even  find the truth in any news story and when you got two sides going it's very easy just to let them  cancel it out so there's something about the intimacy of of what journalism used to be that  at least you could get a straight story about something that wasn't a you know infused with  opinion or spin you felt yeah the guy was truly going out there to find the truth of a story and then  coming back to report it as opposed to bill o'reilly and his no spin zone which we laugh our asses off 
[03:52:30]  no spin it's the most spun show i've ever seen in my life spins more than a tornado  i'm not making a journalism argument that's probably a bad argument because i'm not saying i i do think  the news had a lot more integrity x amount of years ago i'm only saying the way people got their  information it's it's like i'm not saying that cronkite uh was it was this dirty you know  fucking a propaganda feeding motherfucker i just think that people back then bought it and and people 
[03:53:00]  today buy it i don't think there's any difference other than the fact that there's more information  there i think there's a difference between too little and too much perhaps there was too little  back then information to really formulate a good opinion on what's real or what's true or untrue  especially with the stories like what was going on in vietnam uh but now there could be yeah but now  there there's there might be too much to fucking sift through now abu grabe you never would have found  that out i mean that's a bad because to me that wasn't the big thing made it uh there's so many 
[03:53:30]  things now that you can find out yeah but abu grabe came through but that came through a real  journalist source i mean it came through i think a connection that cy hirsch at the new yorker held  cy hirsch they emailed right right yeah emailed the picture yeah but a real journalist i mean they gave  it to the guy that they knew would crack it sure i mean you know this is the guy that that did my  milai i mean i mean he was a real dude i mean they they did they definitely knew who they were sending  but years ago it was like he'd have to find a fucking the baghdad photo mat develop the pictures 
[03:54:00]  mail them to the guy now it's you know a few touches of the keys and the pictures are there  in the guy's hand definitely out of benefits i'm just i'm just saying that i think overall it's made  individuals more isolated and then less engaged uh in in real critical thought and i think that just  because there's more information like like he was saying it doesn't mean that that it makes it more  confusing in some respects it's another thing like jimmy what you were saying about uh uh the old  news as opposed to now the sources of information news newspaper whatever uh you had that it was 
[03:54:30]  limited as far as quantity goes but people got together and talked about it also so you had like  people getting together and talking about what they saw on the news and giving opinions when now you're  pretty much isolated like you say you're online you're really not communicating with anyone you're  posting your opinions other people are flaming your opinion calling you an asshole you got  fucking videos you put up that people call fake know it's real so you don't you you have no clue 
[03:55:00]  what's authentic anymore and what's not yeah you never did though i mean i don't think they're really  even though guys like like uh cronk i had much more integrity than these scumbags do now yeah i don't  think there ever was like that way you were just gonna know all right this is accurate this is fair  once it was owned by corporate it's hard yeah you're right yeah once big money started being made  from the news the news never fucking made money right the news was there to to break even almost  right yeah and just to kind of so the channel we're informing the people this is our civic 
[03:55:30]  responsibility when our license comes up for renewal we have to fucking do this but the news became  something that made money that is sponsored and and has a general manager and program directors and  they have to make money and that's why you got dance fridays right because they want you to tune in  so so i gotta go so you like surveillance uh no  you gotta check out i gotta what no no no i just got to uh like i gotta change hotels i gotta be out 
[03:56:00]  by noon we're uh ready to wrap up and can i say so you're a fan of surveillance no  but i am sitting here going how come you can't see me on the webcam someone was the one that started  about i felt paranoid about putting you on the webcam i was i started this 40 minutes ago and then shut  up for 40 minutes so i i wait i want to say for the record i don't want people going through my  computer i i identify with the shade i have nothing to hide a lot of machine believe me the searches  i've been doing it's for transcontinental flights and trans ams oh hey wait you're looking for old 
[03:56:30]  trans ams going with uh mark's thing there with the military you'd be a general jimmy yeah generally  they would give you a general i'd love to see him just in uniform so they look at your computer you're  like you know good news bad news you gotta go in the army but we'll make your job the law  enforcement would ask jimmy why didn't you just look up amco if you have a tranny probably there's  not one search here for amco the bad news is you're a human toilet the good news is congratulations  general in general no it's no it's weird about this radio show it's got to be brought up uh mark
