<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a song parody celebrating the Boston Red Sox's World Series victory, a celebration that extended into a discussion about the increased popularity of Red Sox fandom and celebrity fans like Tom Hanks.  The hosts then transitioned to a recounting of Opie's disastrous party the previous night, where even XM Satellite Radio boss Eric Logan and his pregnant wife went without food and drinks.  Earl's unsuccessful attempt to pitch a Black Rock Coalition radio show to Logan was highlighted, including playing audio clips of Earl's angry and offensively worded reaction to the rejection.

The show next shifted to a scathing critique of Ashley Simpson's disastrous lip-syncing performance on Saturday Night Live, punctuated by the hosts' use of derogatory names.  Earl called in, briefly discussing his work producing a dance show, which segued into a conversation about his perceived lack of work ethic.  A caller, Dave, then graphically detailed his unsuccessful encounter with a Craigslist escort, prompting Jimmy Norton to interject with his own experiences and offer Dave off-air advice and contacts. The show concluded its first section with a surprised and slightly concerned reaction to a positive New York Times article about the show.

The next segment heavily featured a discussion of this New York Times article about their move to XM Satellite Radio. Opie and Anthony (Greg Hughes and Anthony Cumia) discussed the article's surprisingly positive portrayal, contrasting it with past negative press coverage, including the St. Patrick's Cathedral sex scandal and the false report of Boston Mayor Menino's death. They discussed their lucrative severance packages and the move to satellite radio, referencing Howard Stern's similar transition.  They joked about the freedoms of satellite radio, mentioning various potentially offensive topics.  The article's author, Randy Kennedy, was praised for his thoroughness. This segment also included tangents involving a caller's story about an on-air sexual encounter, anecdotes about Opie's sparsely furnished apartment and a party he hosted for an XM executive, Jim Norton's absence from the article, obscene language, racist and homophobic jokes, a listener's McGriddle incident, a story about a woman finding a used condom in her muffin, and a segment of the "Two Bar Tape" prank call to a bar owner named Red.

The third segment focused on Jim Norton’s experience at a Metallica concert, including celebrity meet-and-greets, the concert itself (featuring Lars Ulrich’s detached performance and his child's unexpected stage appearance), and backstage encounters.  This was followed by further highly critical and vulgar commentary on Ashley Simpson’s SNL performance.  A female trucker, Lori, called in, leading to a discussion about her profession, physical attributes, sex life, and experiences with violence on the road. Comedian Billy Burr was a guest, and Lori joined via phone.  The show repeatedly referenced video footage from the Ashley Simpson incident and the ice skater incident available on their website.

The subsequent segment concentrated on the lives of long-haul truckers, triggered by a caller's comment about truck stop restrooms. This led to humorous and sexually explicit discussions about truck stop prostitutes, truck cab amenities, and long-distance driving challenges.  The recurring joke of sending Steve on the road with a trucker was reiterated. Callers, including Jim from Philly and "The Reaper," shared their experiences, and Mike from Buffalo recounted a pathetic dating story.  This segment also included prank calls to O.J. Simpson, a discussion of Al Green's wardrobe malfunction, and the airing of two banned Canadian PSAs on spousal abuse.  The segment concluded with a couple providing live audio of a sexual encounter.

The final segment covered a news story about three women who drowned when their SUV plunged into the Passaic River.  The hosts and callers speculated on the events leading up to the accident, discussing the women's actions and possible reasons for their inability to escape. A firefighter called in to provide expert input. The segment also included a caller who farted on air, a discussion of management suggestions for the show, a Tony Danza review, anecdotes about crazy uncles and racist cartoons, promotion for XM Radio and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and a profane phone call with a customer service representative.

[00:00:00]  You very greedy, careful what you wish, you just might get it  Then it all crashes down, then you break your crown  Then you put your finger, but there's no one around  Just want one thing, just to play the king  But the castle's crumbled and you're left for just a day  Where's your crown? Take a hand  No, you're just nothing 
[00:00:30]  When you're crown king, nothing  No, you're just nothing  Absolutely nothing  This now concludes the O&A Variety Hour 
[00:01:00]  Stay tuned for the Opie and Anthony Show, spreading across America  It's the O&A virus  AAAAA!  I don't know where to go  I don't know how to do this  I feel like I'm laying on the wall  I'm coming to the office  I remember I just went to the office  I know it's not a thing  I need to know it's not a thing  I remember I của mine  I know it's not a thing  I felt like I'm doing this  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  All that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel.  Jesus.  Already?  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Nothing is over!  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:06:00]  Yay! 
[00:06:30]  I'm going to play the whole show and I think I'll do a good job and I think I'll do a good job.  So, yeah, I'm pretty brave.  Pretty courageous.  I'm going to play the Opie and I'm going to play the Opie and I'll do a good job.  Yeah!  Go Sox.  Why are you cheering?  Go Sox.  What?  I'm a huge Red Sox fan.  It's over, Johnny.  I'm a huge Red Sox fan.  It's over, Johnny.  They will win this.  They will win the World Series. 
[00:07:00]  And it's already over.  It is over.  1918 is over.  Two in a row.  That's it.  It's done.  I'm a huge Red Sox fan.  Who wouldn't be?  What was the score?  Or 6-2, just in case people are jotting things down at home.  6-2, Sox over the cards.  And they beat the cards 11-9 in the first game there.  So, there you have it, man.  How would you like to wring out Ortiz's gloves, his batting gloves, onto something you're eating, 
[00:07:30]  like toast or something?  Can the guy spit in his gloves anymore?  Those things must be disgusting.  He's constantly spitting in them.  Well, the team's a mess.  As he blasts home runs and whatnot.  The team is a mess.  Yeah.  Between the spitting, the crap they put on their helmets, the pine tar all on their batting helmets.  Oh, they're all over.  Their batting helmets, their greasy hair.  Yeah.  They figured out how to win, Anthony.  Apparently they have.  1918 is going to be a distant memory, finally. 
[00:08:00]  That's it.  I absolutely see no way, no way they can screw this up.  None.  The Red Sox are winning the World Series.  That's it.  We've got to get used to it.  And that's just what's going to happen.  But I'm a huge Red Sox fan.  You know that.  I always have been, Opie.  Much like a lot of the celebrities you see now and everyone else that's walking around with a goddamn hat with a B on it.  Yep.  Tom Hanks, they interviewed him last night during the game.  He was with Jimmy Fallon. 
[00:08:30]  I think I got audio there.  In Fenway.  And, oh my God, Tom Hanks, a big fan, I guess.  Out of nowhere.  Well, because there are a lot of Boston Red Sox fans in L.A.  Opie, I saw the whole cast of that 70s show sitting in the stands watching the game.  Apparently all big Red Sox fans.  Who knew?  They sit them in the box seats.  They put the B hat on them.  They put the brand new B hat on.  I see a lot of Boston hats right here in New York City all of a sudden.  Of course. 
[00:09:00]  All of a sudden, everyone wants to be a Red Sox fan.  Everyone jumping on the bandwagon.  I hate that.  Every single year, no matter who's in the World Series, you start seeing people walking around the streets of New York with that team hat on.  I do have a lot of Pat's hats, too.  I got to say that Tom Hanks, I don't blame him for rooting for Boston.  We saw what happened the last time he rooted for the Eagles or the Phillies.  Oh, there you have it.  You know what you're going to have to get used to, Anthony?  What?  Being a Yankee fan.  The chant starts next year. 
[00:09:30]  The chant starts next year.  What chant would that be?  Well, it's going to be tough because the Yanks won the World Series in 2000, so you're going to hear, you know, in 1918, you're going to hear 2000.  2000.  It's kind of hard.  Yeah, it doesn't really have much of a rhythm.  But the Boston Red Sox fans, they'll figure out how to make that rhyme, I'm telling you.  Of course.  Because being a huge Islander fan forever, we used to chant, 1940.  Yeah.  Until the Rangers won, and then it's like, 1984. 
[00:10:00]  And they've done so well ever since.  True.  Yeah.  Very true.  So, well, there you go.  Congratulations to the Red Sox fans.  Stop it.  Congratulate them.  They stink.  They're going to blow it.  Why shouldn't they be congratulated?  They've done nothing yet.  They won two ball games.  They're going to win the World Series.  Jimmy.  And the deciding factor?  Curt Schilling.  Like I told you.  You think that's the deciding factor?  It has been the deciding factor all year long.  I don't think so.  I think it's one of the smaller factors, but I think these guys know how to make that ball 
[00:10:30]  disappear.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I like Ortiz arguing that it wasn't a foul ball.  He said it went wrapped around.  He hits a ball, you know, hard like he usually does, and it goes foul.  And he starts bitching that it went around the foul pole like some magic Fenway energy  pulled it.  Don't worry.  You're kicking ass.  You don't have to lie about foul balls.  But, look, they're a great team. 
[00:11:00]  They're going all the way.  Jimmy, you say, no, they only won two games.  Like I said, I see no way they can screw this up.  There is no way in hell the Red Sox will screw this up.  They are going ahead and winning the World Series.  I can't wait to replay this audio.  Neither can I.  Please.  I know, I know.  No way.  And then the Pats beat the Jets yesterday, 13-7.  The battle of the undefeated.  I'm so glad Ben was on his best behavior in front of the boss at my house last night. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, who was over there?  Eric Logan.  Oh, the big boss at Opie's house.  Pretty much runs all the programming here on XM Satellite Radio.  Wow.  I had 130 channels of crystal clear audio, and Norton was there.  I had a little gathering for the big game.  Is that what that was, without one snack?  This gathering stinks.  Oh, my goodness.  You didn't bring any snacks?  I'm not that guy.  Any beverages? 
[00:12:00]  No, when I invite people over, just come on and hang out.  Why don't you just have us stand in the yard and look at the TV through the window?  Not one beverage, not one snack.  Forty minutes into it, he's like, you want water?  We're all just sitting here like asses.  You're entertaining.  I don't know how to entertain this.  My entertaining is pretty much, hey, you want to watch the game together.  That's it.  Come on over.  Cavemen knew to throw an elk on the fire when someone was coming over.  No, I'm the worst host.  I'm all about, just come on over.  We'll figure it out when you get there. 
[00:12:30]  Eric's wife is pregnant.  Not a beverage for her.  Not maybe would you like some water.  Lady who's pregnant, she just sits there and she's like, can I have some water?  Finally, he jumps up.  Right out of the faucet.  Aaron, she's going to have a baby in like three weeks, and I have nothing for her.  Nothing.  Did you have glasses for the water?  Yeah.  I had clean dishes at least, but it was like, come on over, let's watch the game.  It's huge because there's a lot of Jets fans and a lot of Pats fans.  We'll get together, we'll watch the game, yell and scream at each other, and we'll figure  out takeout and all that when you get here.  Don't you have a deli right down the road? 
[00:13:00]  Dude, I live within what?  A hundred yards of a million restaurants.  Yeah, I mean a deli where you could have gotten some chips.  No, it was like, come on over, I got menus, we'll order food.  Yeah, so me and Ben are eating sushi with no tables.  Stupid doesn't have tables either.  So have some miso soup in your lap and scrawl your ball bag while you sip tap water.  What a hot party.  Mary Tyler Moore throws better parties than you do.  You already stink.  No room for anyone to sit.  Oh, no. 
[00:13:30]  Earl is just, when I walked in and sat down, Earl had to stand up.  It was kind of like the old days on the Selma buses.  Earl did give up his seat way too quickly.  Earl gave up his seat for Norton.  I like that.  Earl was sitting on the big, nice leather couch there,  and he gets right up for Jimmy Norton when Jimmy arrives.  That's a cool place for a party.  If you're having three people to the party and they all like tap water,  I mean that's definitely the place to be.  Not even a folding chair.  I can't believe you.  How much advance notice did you have that anyone was coming over? 
[00:14:00]  A couple hours or a day?  Oh, no.  We talked about it the day before.  But he even then bitches about all the trash at the end of it.  He's like, oh, you guys leave this place a mess.  There's trash.  Yeah, after the party.  I suppose we're supposed to get up and clean and swipe as we have it.  Well, I discovered I have a rat somewhere.  You have a rat in your house?  I thought it was a mouse.  City living.  Great.  But Jimmy Norton goes, ah, that's so funny.  Everyone thinks it's a mouse.  A mouse.  No.  When they see it.  But it's a rat.  Of course it's a rat.  That's because my brother had his whole family over a few months ago and they left food everywhere. 
[00:14:30]  And I'm not thinking about it.  I'm just like, you know, I'll clean it up eventually.  It's in the kitchen area, right?  Food they must have brought, right?  Oh, yeah.  All sorts of like granola and nut snacks, all crap.  Rat food.  Yeah, pretty much it's rat food.  They brought over rat food.  And it's laying on the kitchen there, the counters.  And a couple days later, I'm like, yeah, maybe I should clean up.  They've been gone for two or three days.  I go in there and there's a mouse slash rat, you know, having a field day.  Really enjoying himself.  And he's still in there, huh? 
[00:15:00]  I guess.  But since then, my kitchen's been spotless.  Have you found any droppings?  No, no, not at all.  Droppings in the cabinets?  The kitchen's been spotless.  Little chocolate chips by your fork.  I'm too paranoid to, you know, have the rat come back.  So, so far, so good.  I'd hate to be a rat in that snackless apartment.  The rat right now is probably a skin and bones.  It's the only starving rat in New York City.  All the other ones are big, fat rats.  Opie's rat is emaciated.  Laying sickly, trying to eat a napkin somewhere. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, that party really bugged me.  We had a good time, though.  It was fun chatting, but I mean, it was like, you know, it was just.  You want a bowl full of Doritos or something, right?  Exactly, something.  Some chips and salsa.  I'm like, you got a soda?  And that's what he had, a soda.  He had a Coke that I had to claim.  And I look in the refrigerator and there's the lonely Coke.  This is classic.  And then Ben goes, do you have any beer?  I go, yeah, I got the beer that you brought last time.  There's a few left.  Oh, no.  So I was good to go. 
[00:16:00]  Good to go.  Sure.  And then a Coke, a couple of beers, and no snick snacks.  And not even a table to put them on.  We're just like, the table's like five.  That little thing you have, the ottoman, with a potpourri arrangement on it.  Like five homos just staring at a potpourri arrangement.  Oh, my God.  I got a nice big TV.  He does have a nice TV.  That's a bonus.  And then there was an awkward moment because Eric Logan shows up.  An awkward moment?  I so far counted about 20.  What fetish have I talked about on this show many, many times over the year? 
[00:16:30]  Jim?  Apparently starvation.  You know, the fetish I have for pregnant women.  Oh, right, right.  I don't know what it is.  It's not like I want to, like, you know, bend them over and bang them.  It's just something about a pregnant woman that kind of turns me on a little bit, okay?  I'll tell you what it is.  It's creepy.  It's not normal.  Did you see A-Rod's wife walking down the beach?  Oh, but having a girl clap on your chest is.  Oh, pregnant?  Yeah, that's a hot picture, actually.  Yeah, she's...  For some reason.  You could tell.  Well, it's a hot picture if you take your hand and block out the belly. 
[00:17:00]  Exactly.  And then it's like, wow, A-Rod's wife is pretty hot.  But she's in a little bikini.  Tiny bikini down the beach.  And she's uber pregged.  She's ready to pop any day.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, so it's kind of awkward when, you know, the boss and his wife do listen  to the show, and they hear me talk about this fetish for pregnant women, and she shows  up, and she's literally going to have a kid tomorrow.  Yeah.  Or next week.  Did you have a couch for her to sit on?  Yeah, we had a couch.  We put a few pillows behind her back.  Did Jimmy get up, let her sit? 
[00:17:30]  Hell no.  Well, they were there first.  I walked in.  It was Eric and his wife were on one couch, and then Ope was next to me, and Ben was in  a chair, and Earl had been sitting where I was sitting, and I didn't ask him to get  up.  He was pacing because he was nervous.  Yeah, he got right up.  He was nervous because...  It was a stupid game.  It was a pretty good game.  And Ben Heckle's like a five-year-old.  You can't watch football with him.  Oh, come on.  It's beginning.  The guy drops the ball, and he goes, nice catch!  Jesus, is that you?  No, no.  He goes...  He's telling you, Heckle, drop something.  Yeah, he goes, you dropped something.  He has a conversation with the TV.  But it's not like mean Heckles, you know? 
[00:18:00]  I mean, I'm yelling racist stuff when my game is losing, and if a whole God forbid a  family member of theirs has died in a fire or something, I'm screaming at the television.  Of course.  And of course, Earl has to pitch his Black Rock radio show to Eric while we're there.  Yeah.  You know, I felt bad for Earl because Earl's like, you know, I had this idea for the Black  Rock Coalition, and I got a demo tape and a resume in my bag.  Eric Logan openly laughs and mocks Earl, thinking he's joking.  And this has been Earl's baby for what, Anthony?  We've known Earl six years. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, he's been...  It's been his baby for six years.  He wants to have a radio show on XM Satellite Radio called the Black Rock Coalition, and  basically, it's black artists that do rock.  That's basically what he wants to do.  And then after you think about it, and you get past the band Living Color, you're like,  hmm, what else are you going to play on this show, you idiot?  That's why the idea doesn't work.  And I know there's a few other black bands out there.  You don't have to...  Well, there's Fishbone, and there's this band.  I know.  Hootie and the Blowfish.  It's Hootie and the Blowfish.  You were running tape of Earl at the party? 
[00:19:00]  I didn't know that.  Yeah, you want to hear some of that?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Oh, Jesus, Earl.  Oh, my God.  I think you got the other clip when Eric Logan kind of turned him down and said, you know,  we don't want the Black Rock Coalition on XM Satellite Radio.  I think this is what Earl said.  Oh, that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel.  Oh, no.  Did Earl hit Eric on the head with a shovel?  Well, that would be audio of Eric after Eric turned him down.  I was thinking of the audio of Eric.  Uh-huh. 
[00:19:30]  Okay, you got it now?  Oh, Lordy Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he says.  No, that's not an idiot.  Do what he says.  No, no, no.  This would be the audio.  Right.  Of Earl.  Of Earl.  After Eric Logan turned him down.  Right, right.  You got it now?  I know what that one is.  If I could find it.  If I could find it.  Okay.  All right.  Well, that would be really, really funny right now.  And if Earl wanted to impress Eric Logan, he should have opened his bag and pulled out  a snack.  That would have been a nice little bag of sour cream and onion chips.  Note to self, cheese and crackers next time. 
[00:20:00]  Something.  Even Bob Kelly, I went to his house before yours.  He had some little peanuts and some cheese and crackers.  Nice.  And Anthony, we all order takeout and we're just stuffing our faces in front of the boss  and his wife as they're just sitting there drinking their water.  Oh, it really was.  That really sounds like an awful time.  It was, yeah.  It really was a bash.  Just five of us sitting there.  Stoic flies.  You're still looking for the clip, right?  Of course I can't find it.  You have played it on the show. 
[00:20:30]  I know.  I know which one it is.  He couldn't have played it if it just happened yesterday.  I can't find it.  That's the clever ruse.  It's from Hardcore.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You're not thinking.  It's this one.  You sure?  It's the one from Hardcore.  It would fit perfectly.  Oh, yes, it is.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Well, maybe it's not in there.  Eric to the rescue.  He's coming into the studio.  Hi, Eric.  Welcome to the area.  Eric, stay in here because we want to play this McShady thing 
[00:21:00]  and I want you to explain what this is all about in a second.  Oh, look at the timing of.  Can I set it up again?  You got it now, Ant?  I don't know.  Yeah.  You got it?  Oh, maybe.  Okay.  So, black girl's at the party and he's pitching his Black Rock Coalition  to the boss, Eric Logan.  Yeah.  And he even told Eric, and this is the true part of this.  He goes, I have a resume and a demo in my bag.  And Eric Logan starts laughing openly thinking this is a joke, 
[00:21:30]  like Earl's being funny.  So, and then Earl looked at Eric Logan and said this.  You don't want to hire niggas, that's all.  Oh, no.  Right there at Opie's big soiree.  Wow, it just didn't have the same effect.  No, not when you wait 20 minutes.  It didn't have the same effect 20 minutes later.  How about I do this, block that off, and actually label it?  All right.  That's a good idea.  That would be smart.  The goose and duck soiree.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up.  We got lots to do today.  We got to talk about Ashley Simpson just totally effing up on SNL. 
[00:22:00]  What?  It was, no.  She was exposed as the fraud that she is.  No, it wasn't.  Her band screwed up, Opie.  Didn't you see the end of the show?  All right.  We'll get into that.  But if you want a little head start, Foundry Music, where opianthony.com has it, I think,  as well.  Opianthony.com has the video of Ashley Simpson just eating it bad live on Saturday Night Live.  Basically, she came out to sing a second song, and they had her lip-syncing music queued  up to the first song, and they started the first song again.  It was a classic Milli Vanilli screw-up. 
[00:22:30]  Without a doubt.  And she's doing that awful little dance.  Oh, my God.  The uncomfortable, I'm screwed dance.  That's the dance of every white man in every club across the country, just flailing little  arms in front of her.  The little arms.  And then she stops, looks around, and tries the little dance again.  Like a little marionette.  It was painful.  Oh, she stinks.  I loved it.  It was awful.  We'll get into that in a little bit.  Talentless whore.  Oh, exactly.  Also, uh...  Huh?  What?  Oh, we got Earl on the line?  Oh, God. 
[00:23:00]  What is Earl doing awake?  What is Earl doing up?  Can we wake him up?  Of course.  It's not like he's going to work, lazy bastard.  Earl.  And he's shiftless to boot.  What's going on, Earl?  It's six o'clock in the morning, guys.  You sound exactly like you do at noon.  Yeah, who are you trying to kid?  Did you have fun at the house yesterday?  Yeah, I had a wonderful time, except for the fact that the Chet's lost, but...  Yeah.  Nah.  Did you have enough to eat at my house?  I didn't even think I ate anything. 
[00:23:30]  Nah.  No, no hominigrits out there for you?  No.  Fried chicken or watermelon?  Nothing like that?  You're awful.  Why didn't you eat any food?  I had to leave at halftime.  Ah.  What did you have to do?  Well, I was actually working yesterday.  Stop it.  What were you...  Over at NEW?  Yeah.  What did you have to do yesterday over there?  Give me a little rundown of your work day.  On a Sunday.  Besides, bring back the one resume that you brought with you that you were hoping to hand 
[00:24:00]  off.  On a Sunday.  What did you have to do?  Well, I had to produce the Joe Cozzi show.  A what?  Joe Cozzi.  I have no idea what that is.  Yeah, what is the Joe Cozzi show, Earl?  Joe Cozzi.  He's on the air.  Oh.  So how do you produce a show?  No, you were on the board.  Oh, he was board-opping.  Oh, so you were pushing buttons for Joe Cozzi.  Right.  But you want the title of producer. 
[00:24:30]  Whatever.  Oh.  It's like 3 a.m.  It's like 6 o'clock in the morning, guys.  I got no fight in me.  So you, like, push the button to turn his mic on and go, Joe, you're on.  You're on the air.  Yeah.  And then Joe talks, and then you go, boink, and hit the next record?  Among other things.  And they gave you this out of, what, charity?  Figured you could use a couple extra bucks?  Oh, just did it as a favor.  All right, so now you're admitting you're not really producing the Joe Cozzi show.  I bet Earl went there to do this for a day and didn't even get paid for it. 
[00:25:00]  I bet no one even knows he was doing this.  Oh, I do.  Somebody probably wanted the day off, and Earl goes, I'll come in.  I'll do it.  Because he loves just going into work, because he doesn't have a...  Earl, I've got to be blunt with you.  They let you go.  They pretty much fired you.  But you still show up for work every day.  No, I asked if I wanted to do it, and I said, sure, why not?  Did you get paid for it?  Of course I did.  Are you insane?  All right.  What kind of show does Joe Cozzi do? 
[00:25:30]  It's sort of like, you know, classic dance show.  Classic dance?  Classic dance?  What's that?  Isn't that a waltz?  Classic R&B, stuff like that.  What'd you do, cue up the polkas, did you?  No.  That sounds awful.  Doesn't that just sound horrible?  Classic dance?  Classic dance.  You know what you should do for the Joe Cozzi show is go to the listeners and hand out earplugs.  This show stinks.  Wow, you're producing the classic dance show.  Well, you shouldn't say that. 
[00:26:00]  Joe likes you guys a lot.  Your career's on a rocket ship.  I don't know who Joe is.  I don't know this Joe.  I don't know what he does.  Tell him you don't want to see him anymore.  He'll understand.  Believe me.  Yes, Steve.  No, Joe Cozzi is this really old school, like 20 years old school KTU jock.  They call him the Supreme Cousine.  Yeah.  Yes, Martini Steve?  And he was one of the, what is it, the transfers from KTU that Frankie brought over when he took over at NWN. 
[00:26:30]  But what does Earl do as the producer of the Joe Cozzi show?  He's board-offing.  He's board-offing.  So he's not really producing.  Much like we're used to Earl, not producing anything.  Earl's taking whatever shifts they give him.  Poor Earl had to wake up for this.  That does stink, though.  They don't give him any shifts because then he would be, as you said, shiftless.  Shiftless.  Are you shiftless, Earl?  Earl?  Did he hang up?  Oh, he got mad and hung up.  No, he's right there.  He's not in there.  Earl? 
[00:27:00]  Earl, at least he didn't fall asleep.  Earl?  Yeah.  All right.  What was going on?  It's all sleep and eat.  No, I just wanted to get a glass of water.  My throat was really dry.  That sounds like everybody at Opie's party yesterday.  All right.  Did it bother you that there was no food at that awful bash Opie 3 yesterday?  Just five of us, like, just sterile idiots sitting there with no food?  Look at me.  I'm not Martha Stewart.  I was like, come on over and hang.  That's all.  No, I understand that.  It wasn't like Martha Stewart. 
[00:27:30]  Martha's getting better service in jail.  Look, it wasn't like...  We would have better snacks with Rod Stewart.  Here, drink seven ounces of this.  It's not like I live in the middle of the desert and there's nothing around.  Exactly.  You should have had your party stocked.  I'm not that guy.  I can't wait to see the photoshopped.  Hey, we'll make it up on...  I can't wait to see the photoshopped of Opie's party.  Oh, he was trying to show us his food.  We got one soda.  We got one beer.  And no legs of lamb.  You like one tap water, Doc?  So when I invite people over, I have to actually get stuff? 
[00:28:00]  Usually you do that.  Usually you go out and you buy some stuff and invite people over.  I have a few things.  I usually get the people there.  You want to do a beer run?  You want to get food?  That's all.  What are you going to hand out to trick-or-treaters?  Lint?  Oh, no.  I'm the guy that hides.  Oh, you hide?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  On Halloween, I turn off all my lights.  This is my first year in a real residential white neighborhood.  Instead of living in a Brooklyn apartment like I was, where you do, you just lock the door and hope for the best. 
[00:28:30]  Hope your vehicle is still there and not in flames when you go outside.  And, yeah, first time.  So I'm thinking I'm going to have to get the candy so they don't, you know, mess the house up or anything.  Very suburbia.  I'm going to have to do that for the first time ever in my whole life.  Oh, that sucks.  Believe that?  I turn off all the lights and hide.  Oh, look.  It's a little ghost.  How are you?  You're supposed to be a little pumpkin head. 
[00:29:00]  What?  Your son has Down syndrome, doesn't he?  Jesus.  All right.  Let's say goodbye, Earl.  Let's move on here.  A little jack-o-lantern head.  Earl.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thanks for, I don't know.  Where'd you buy that gag tongue for him?  That's huge.  I hope that's not a choking hazard.  It glistens like it's real when it hangs out of his mouth.  Oh, little metals around the neck.  I hope I had a good time. 
[00:29:30]  I didn't have any problems with anything quite.  Why'd you buy the Pete Rose wig?  All right, Earl.  We're going to let you go.  All right, brother.  All right.  There goes Black Earl, everybody.  Still pitching his Black Rock Coalition in the year 2004.  Okay.  We've got to take a break.  Where's the sex bagel?  He brought in some cool stuff.  He did.  Oh, there you are.  What is this?  What we're going to hear here?  It's called a mash-up. 
[00:30:00]  It's where you take the lyrics from one song and you mix it with the music from another.  Is that what they call it?  A mash-up?  A mash-up.  It's the new trend for the kids nowadays.  Yeah, the kids love it.  And this one is Eminem's Without Me mixed with Wings' Silly Love Song.  Right.  Silly Love Song.  Wow, that actually goes together.  Well, this guy made it go together.  It's kind of cool.  Is that the DJ band that we listened to in the car that one time?  Yeah.  Well, no.  That's a very similar type of thing.  This has been going on for years, but now mash-ups have become the biggest thing.  Yeah, it's pretty...  It's just cool. 
[00:30:30]  You're not going to laugh at this.  It's just cool.  And when we get back, we're going to talk about the New York Times article that came out yesterday, okay?  Check this out.  Let's hope this one turns out pretty darn good, huh?  Guess who's back?  Back again.  Stady's back.  Tell a friend.  Guess who's back?  Back again.  Stady's back.  Tell a friend.  I've created a monster.  If nobody wants to see more, some of them are they want Stady, I'm shocked. 
[00:31:00]  Well, if you want Stady, this is what I'll give you.  A little bit of weed mixed with some heart.  They got some pockets that'll jumpstart.  My heart quicker than a shock when I get shocked.  I'm just at the hospital by the doctor when I'm not cooperating.  But I'm rocking the table while he's operating.  You waited this long to stop debating.  Cause I'm back, I'm on the brag, inovulating.  I know that you got a job in Cheney, but your husband's heart problems complicating.  So the FCC won't let me be.  You'll let me be me, so let me see.  They try to shut me down on MTV, but it feels so empty without me.  So come on a dip, bow on your lips. 
[00:31:30]  Talk back, come on your lips.  So come on your lips and get ready.  Cause this shit's about to get heavy.  I just settled on my lawsuit.  Fuck you, Debbie!  Now this looks like a job for me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Cause we need a little controversy.  Cause it feels so empty without me.  I say this looks like a job for me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Cause we need a little controversy.  Cause it feels so empty without me.  Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious, embarrassed.  The parents still listen to Elvis.  They start feeling like prisoners helpless.  Now someone comes along on a mission and yells,  A visionary, vision is scary. 
[00:32:00]  Can start a revolution.  Polluting the airwaves are revel.  So just let me revel and bask in the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass.  And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe.  For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me.  Well, I'm back.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Fix your penis and a fool.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  I'm in a inner ring and a front of your skin like a splitter.  The center of attention.  Back for the winter.  I'm in a resting.  The best thing's investing.  Infesting.  When you get ears and nesting.  Nesting.  Attention, please.  Feel the tension.  Soon as someone mentions me.  Here's my ten cents.  My two cents is free.  A nuisance.  You sent, you sent for me. 
[00:32:30]  Now this looks like a time for me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little controversy.  Because we feel no anxious without me.  I say this looks like a time for me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little controversy.  Because we feel no anxious without me.  Love doesn't come in a minute.  Sometimes it doesn't come at all.  I only know that when I'm in it.  It isn't silly.  Love isn't silly. 
[00:33:00]  Love isn't silly at all.  Love isn't silly. 
[00:33:30]  You're going to be so empty without me.  Come on, poogie.  Let's burn this motherfucker down.  Here we go.  Now.  Would you kick your pants off and dance around a little?  No, I'm not going to.  Damn it.  Kill yourself.  Oops.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Do you watch real stories of the highway patrol?  Do you know the show, Real Stories?  I get violent watching that show. 
[00:34:00]  I'm chucking shit at my TV.  You dicks.  It's blatant police harassment that has passed off as entertainment.  Middle America sitting around with their thumb in their ass.  Good thing it's him and not me.  Could have been me last night.  It's almost like police propaganda reels.  As though the police department made this themselves.  Because it's got that constant voiceover narrative.  John Law is never wrong.  Officer Bob will teach you not to question authority. 
[00:34:30]  I'm serious.  They bust people for nothing.  They will always traffic stops.  They pull people over for nothing.  Because they fit a profile.  Which means you're not white enough today.  Or you look like the guy who's fucking his daughter.  So it just trumps up reasons.  We're going to pull this gentleman over to the side of the road.  See he's only got three screws holding down his license plate.  And technically it's supposed to be four screws. 
[00:35:00]  So we're just going to zip him off the side of the road here.  Rip off his doors and his hood.  And we're going to pull his luggage out and screw it across the fucking highway.  And we're going to sit dogs on him.  And we're going to put microscopes up his ass.  It's all just routine.  See.  They find a marijuana seed lodged under the catalytic converter somewhere.  And wrestle this poor son of a bitch to the ground.  And then they have the propaganda scroll that comes up on your screen. 
[00:35:30]  If convicted, that marijuana seed could be grown into three plants with proper sunlight and fertilization.  That's possession with intent to distribute.  He could face 99 years in a pen to pen to victory.  But he won't.  The reenactments are the best.  Where they show the real cop from the story.  He's some triple chin southern pig with gravy coming out of his head. 
[00:36:00]  And he said, oh, I remember that day.  We was in quite a pickle.  But the guy playing him in the reenactment is some young buff guy right out of Gold's Gym with a crew cut and a cape on.  Sun going down behind him.  Filmed like Clark Kent on a mountaintop.  Voice over again.  Officer Bob was doling out chocolates to the war orphans when the call came in.  He wasn't. 
[00:36:30]  He was rousting hookers for free handjobs when the call came in.  Confiscating dime bags from high school kids and then getting high all by himself in the Kmart parking lot when the call came in.  There's too many laws.  Everything's illegal.  They keep adding more things.  They just keep making more and more shit illegal.  And they never take any laws off the books. 
[00:37:00]  They should have ten laws in this country.  That's a maximum of ten laws.  That's all they should be allowed to have.  And you vote on a 900 number.  So you can be a fat son of a bitch and still be a productive member of society.  Then you'd have all the laws everyone agrees on.  Like rape and murder and burglary and assault.  And then you could have half a dozen of the little bullshit mix and match laws.  Don't sell drugs and wear a seatbelt.  Don't masturbate on the bus. 
[00:37:30]  And put on a helmet.  And then when you want to add a new one, you're going to kick the least popular back to the people.  Okay, I can't smoke in bars anymore, but I can jack off on the bus again.  That way only a certain fraction of people are getting screwed at any given time on a rotating basis. 
[00:38:00]  Do me one favor.  What cuddles?  Why don't you get some pork into your studio and have her shit on the plate and put it in the microwave.  And then have her roll around in it screaming donkey sausage, donkey sausage.  Raquel?  That would be me.  You want to shit on a plate for us?  Okay.  And then run around saying what?  Donkey sausage?  Donkey sausage.  Dude, Jim and Dean's donkey sausage.  I can do that.  I can do that.  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage! 
[00:38:30]  I like it.  That's something oddly attractive.  I don't know about that.  That's got to be a promo.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, nice.  I like that.  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  Look at a little Jimmy Norton eating my granola this morning.  Yeah, what the hell is this I'm seeing?  You make fun of my breakfast products, but there you go.  You're enjoying a little bowl of granola.  I'd like to thank the intern for bringing us both a big thing of milk. 
[00:39:00]  Apparently I'm the professional now.  Where's my house plant, you psycho?  You're supposed to share a little thing of milk.  You don't bring me a 40-gallon jug of milk for an awful paper bowl full of granola.  A little styrofoam bowl?  What is that?  Yeah, I need a bowl and a little spoon.  Granola.  Yeah.  You're eating healthy.  I just couldn't believe he actually brought in a snack, so I took advantage of it as fast  as I could.  Hey, I'm good with the breakfast food.  I got plenty of breakfast food.  That's the only thing I go to the supermarket for these days.  You do have English muffins. 
[00:39:30]  I noticed that.  Oh, that's right.  I got English muffins.  I got the Pop-Tarts.  I got the oatmeal.  I got all sorts of granola, cereals, yogurt.  You have really the snacks of a pedophile.  Pop-Tarts and a plastic bag and duck tape and anything else yummy the little fella would  like.  A little cotton candy maker out back.  You want a big one?  Hey, Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on with you guys?  Come on, tell us something.  Let's go.  Okay, I was listening to Motormouth on the 60s at 6 yesterday afternoon. 
[00:40:00]  On Channel 6 on XM Satellite Radio.  Groovy.  Yeah, that's the one.  And anyway, he was talking about this woman who could take the stem off of a cherry and  put it in her mouth and tie that stem into a knot.  I've seen that.  And I got to thinking, what if she'd go down on you?  Man, that'd be a hell of a blowjob, wouldn't it?  You were thinking that?  Well, sort of.  That or a tongue ring, sure.  Yeah.  I think the tongue ring works a little better than that, but yeah. 
[00:40:30]  I've seen that a million times in the bars.  How the fuck are we going to make something out of this?  That's an old gag.  Jesus Christ.  That's what they're talking about on the 60s on 6?  Just play the freaking songs of the 60s.  That's obviously what people think of when they see that.  You know what I mean?  You stay in the obvious.  If you say, I saw a girl taking communion, and the wafer dropped on her tongue, and she  slipped it back in, and then you came to that conclusion, that's interesting.  Right.  Right.  But this cherry-tying thing, we all think that when we see that. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Chuck's trying, though.  Thank you, Chuck.  Bye, Chuck.  Hey, Chuck.  Yeah.  What's your favorite 60s song?  What?  Dave from Queens.  How are you, buddy?  Hey, guys.  I've been a huge, huge fan for five years.  It's great to have you back.  Oh, cool.  What do you got for the show today?  Well, I've been listening to Norton for years on his hooker experiences, and I've always  wanted to give it a shot, you know, because I don't get laid that often.  So, uh...  And why is that, sir? 
[00:41:30]  It's just, you know, I've been busy, you know, at college, I'm trying to get into Yale, and  I don't really have time to, like, take these chicks out to dinner.  Yeah, who has time to get laid ever?  Yeah, in college?  No one gets laid in college.  Jesus, dude.  I thought he was going to say something about work or, you know, college.  I can't get laid.  I'm too busy.  I sell coke.  Who's got time for that?  Go to happy hour every day?  I can't find time to bang broads.  Are you insane?  Well, you know, I mean, you're living in New York City, you know, there's so much shit  going on around you.  Oh, New York City. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, there's no girls here.  Absolutely none.  New York City.  It's just like being in the Mojave Desert.  Yeah.  There's nothing around.  There's only eight million people on this little island.  I mean, it's very hard to bump into somebody who might sleep with you.  Eh, you know, whatever.  All right.  So, how old are you, sir?  I'm 21.  21.  He's 21.  And you don't have time to get laid?  Well, I mean, I'm not a virgin.  I mean, I had sex a couple times, but, you know, whatever.  All right.  So, he does have time to get laid, but he's just probably a little shy. 
[00:42:30]  Maybe not the best looking fella.  Not to knock you, sir.  I'm not the best looking fella either.  Maybe you just try to say you're too busy.  What, do you have a few pounds on you, sir?  No, I'm actually pretty skinny.  I guess it's more of a confidence thing anyway.  Are you a svelte fella?  Eh, you know.  Well, you know, it's a Jewish family, kind of religious.  Okay.  Oh, are you one of those guys that has to have, like, sex through the sheet?  No.  Like, you saw it Curb Your Enthusiasm?  No, but we are supposed to stay virgin until we're married.  Do you wear a yarmulke all the time?  No, no, no.  Because I got to tell you, that look, not a chick magnet. 
[00:43:00]  They really got to upgrade the whole yarmulke look.  Yeah.  They got to upgrade that, because, you know what?  Don't get pissed at me.  It's just an observation.  But when you're walking down the sidewalk with the yarmulke on with the hot chick, something's wrong there.  I got an idea.  How about put a bill on it and a bee on it?  You could be like a Red Sox fan with a yarmulke.  They haven't come out with the Red Sox yarmulkes yet?  I'm surprised.  I don't know yet.  Do you have the Curly Fries sideburns?  No.  No?  Well, there's a lot of different sects of the religion. 
[00:43:30]  Sex.  The Jewish religion.  I said sex.  Sex.  Sex.  Yeah, I'm pretty not.  S-E-C-T-S.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't wear the, like, wacky hat and the big beard and the black coat and stuff.  Nothing like that.  In August?  The heavy black coat in August?  How awful is that?  Yeah, with the top hat and the Curly Fries sideburns.  If you look like that, then I understand why you're not getting laid.  But if you're, like, a regular Jewish guy that has to put the yarmulke on every once  in a while, you should be getting some action, bro.  I've been in Arizona, by the way, and I've seen the rabbis with those huge black coats 
[00:44:00]  in August.  You don't have to go to Arizona for that.  You can go right to Brooklyn.  You know what's funny?  When the people that aren't Jewish go to a Jewish event and has to wear the yarmulke?  Yeah.  What is that all about?  Why do you have to do that?  Didn't Earl have to wear a yarmulke at something?  Yeah.  It was, like, on the front of his head.  I forget what it was.  It was ridiculous.  That's hysterical.  It's silly, though.  When you go to a black guy's house, you don't have to quit your job.  I mean, why should you have to assimilate to the religion? 
[00:44:30]  Jesus.  I'm sorry.  That was very inappropriate.  Very mean today, already.  Yeah.  Very mean-spirited.  Let's see what Dave's up to.  So you're not getting laid, and you don't have time for that, I guess.  You're 21 years old, and you had your first escort experience?  Yes.  But I thought you had to stay a virgin.  Oh, but you blew off the virginity thing a while ago.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  So how did the first escort experience go?  Yeah.  So I've been asking Norton where to go, and he told me about Craigslist, so I checked it  out.  Oh, good.  Yeah, I saw this chick, Jen, from Brooklyn, and on her picture, you only saw really her 
[00:45:00]  tits and her face.  You know, you didn't see anything on there.  And she looked pretty cute, but her back looked like a cobra ready to strike.  You know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  Big back?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, big back.  So I give her a call.  I'm like, listen, I want to come over in an hour.  She's like, all right, come over.  I'm sipping vodka my whole way into, you know, in the car, because, you know, I'm a little  nervous and stuff.  And I get over there, and this chick opens the door, and she's as wide as she is tall.  Oh, boy. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  She's about 5'3", and I am not even exaggerating, well over 200 pounds.  Wow.  Hot.  Nice.  That's not the worst part.  All right.  Let's get to the worst part.  What happened?  She's walking with a cane, dude.  Really?  She's got a cane and, like, a little bandage on her foot, you know what I mean?  But I suspected the cane.  Maybe she was pitching for the Sox.  I was going to say that.  You beat me to it, you bastard.  Oh, that's hilarious.  How much did this broad cost?  She's $2.50, man. 
[00:46:00]  $2.50?  $2.50?  For a broken one?  For a dollar a pound?  And, of course, after seeing the mess that she was, you turned around and went home, right?  No, not quite.  Of course not, because you're a guy just like all of us.  What did you do to her?  At first, we, you know, whatever, we get into the bed, and I don't know, for some reason  it wasn't working for me, you know, I wasn't getting really, you know.  You had whiskey dick.  And, uh...  All the vodka you drank on the way over, you gave yourself whiskey dick.  And no hot chick dick, too. 
[00:46:30]  Jesus.  Sounds like a pig.  I was asking her to get on top, you know.  Uh-oh.  On top of your tiny little Jewish penis?  I weigh about $1.50, man, and the dick almost destroyed me.  You're hung like an acorn, and she's trying to get on top of that thing?  Jesus.  Yeah, so I tell her, all right, listen, let me just bang you from behind.  And I started, you know, banging her for about 20 minutes from the back, and...  Wait, you finally got a rod?  Yeah, I got a rod, and, you know, I actually...  When he started doing her taxes. 
[00:47:00]  I was banging this huge whore from the back.  I noticed all the deductions that you could be taking.  Oh, my God.  Oh, hey, look at this.  Oh, tax shelter.  Do you know how much I could be saving you?  All right, so you're doing her from behind?  Yeah, so I'm doing her from behind for about 20 minutes, and then I finish, you know, I come,  and then she turns around, and she starts, you know, like, stroking my cock or whatever.  She's like, oh, you fucked me so nice.  And I'm like, wait a minute, where's the condom? 
[00:47:30]  You know, and she...  Oh, and she mistakenly put it on your nose?  It was on your hat, you silly goose.  She thought it was your yarmulke.  All right.  Yeah, so we take a look, and the condom somehow ended up on the floor.  So it turns out I was banging this giant whore for about 20 minutes raw.  With nothing?  Yeah, with nothing.  I like big butts in a candlelight.  I don't like the fact that she charged $2.50.  That's the worst...  For Craigslist, you're going to get that, man.  Once in a while, you're going to find, like, a real awful fatso, but they should charge 
[00:48:00]  you $100.  Yeah, right?  For a half hour.  For something awful.  You should pay $250.  Is that the going rate?  $100 for a half hour?  It depends.  I had one last night come over.  It was $150.  Of course you did.  Remember the first day we came in, I showed you that picture online of that hot chick?  Uh-huh.  The topless girl, I had her come last night.  It was $150 for a half, but she's solid, man.  She's a nine.  Yeah.  How is it when you get the person that comes over a few times?  Is it like, hey, how you doing?  Like, do you become friendly?  She recognized me.  She's like, is this the comedian?  And I'm like, yeah. 
[00:48:30]  So, on the phone.  Which helps, because then they know who you are.  They know you're not a creep.  But, dude, are you still here, sweetie?  Oh, yeah.  Off air, I'll tell you what name to look up online.  If you want to look her up, I'll tell you who this girl is.  She's really hot.  Oh, yeah, please.  I'll give it to you off the air.  I'm not guaranteeing anything will happen.  Maybe you'll just, you know, you'll pay for her time and friendship.  So, that's about it for the story.  The condom was on the floor, and you realized you were doing it without a condom?  Yes.  Well, yeah, those are the things.  I mean, when she was blowing me, she was using teeth.  Oh, the rake job. 
[00:49:00]  You got the rake job.  Teeth.  And I actually had a little bit of Jim's experience when, I remember that story that you were telling  with Dice, Jim, like when this chick was going down on you, and you went, like, a little south.  Oh, a little south.  Yeah, it happened many times.  How about, he goes all the way around the corner.  Yeah, I had a little bit of that butterscotch pudding.  Did she give you, ugh.  That is just the worst.  Dude, did she give you oral with the teeth before you had full service sex with her?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, good.  So what she did was rough it up so there's some open wounds there, and then you slip 
[00:49:30]  it in raw on a hooker that is a mess.  Yeah.  Yeah, not too risky.  Yeah, don't worry about it, dude.  I wouldn't worry about having open wounds on your penis when you have sex with a hooker.  Check in with us in eight months.  You'll be 60 pounds lighter.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  I'm going to recommend a girl off air, and I'll tell you one thing.  Just seeing that there's a bunch of girls with the same name.  This one is a blonde.  I think she has like 36 Ds, and the face is blocked out, but you can see she's topless.  She's so hot.  Blonde, 36 D?  Yeah.  I think so.  I'll give you the name off the air.  I don't want to give it on the air because I asked her if she wanted me to, and she's  like, I don't know.  Jimmy's going to upgrade you today, all right?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  And then you call back and tell us how it is with the new one.  All right.  Sweet.  Mazel tov.  And do a half hour.  It's 150, you silly goose.  All right.  Cool. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  There he goes, Dave.  His first escort experience.  Yes, he didn't know.  Speaking of which, you ever go over the Williamsburg Bridge about Friday afternoon right before  sundown when the Citics are all trying to get back over to Williamsburg?  They'll crash right into you.  They don't fucking care.  It's one of the funniest experiences ever because they're all in a rush because they have to  get home before sundown.  Right.  And there's more accidents on the Williamsburg Bridge Friday afternoon at like 6 o'clock.  I bet.  Yeah.  Hysterical.  Ground control to Opie and Anthony.  Oh.  They were the first to leave the mothership.  Now Howard Stern is joining their orbit. 
[00:51:00]  It says it right there.  We were first.  There you go.  New York Times.  Why is he still delusional over there saying that he's the first one to go to satellite  radio?  He's the innovator.  The New York Times did a huge article on your pals Opie and Anthony.  It was very big, very positive.  We were surprised.  We must now say, I apologize.  No, I'm quite frankly very worried.  If the New York Times is writing good articles on Opie and Anthony, I think we've got to  change the show.  Well, it's not about us being charitable. 
[00:51:30]  I think we have to reinvent ourselves or something here, man.  Oh, the making fun of retards line?  Oh.  You really did accurately sum up all the humor in that one little paragraph.  Let's see.  This is a very long article.  It was in the arts and leisure section of the Sunday Times.  Front page?  Front page.  Pictures and everything, even though they picked some wacky pictures.  But what the hell?  They got our names in the paper.  They did?  Let me see.  Jim, where's your quote here?  I wanted to...  Oh, you know what?  Jim Norton's quote must be on...  Probably on the... 
[00:52:00]  Maybe there's going to be a part two of this article next Sunday.  I hope so, because I had a couple of quotes, guys.  Where's...  Do you see Jim Norton's quote in here, Anthony?  I don't think I did.  You did talk for an hour while we were talking to the guy.  But no, remember I said the thing about, okay, cursing too much is no good.  I said a few very poignant things.  It's pretty funny, because, you know, it's pretty obvious Norton is the third member of  the show now.  You know, Opie, Anthony, and Jim, it just doesn't rhyme.  You know, so it's Opie and Anthony, whatever, featuring Jim Norton. 
[00:52:30]  You're a feature player.  I don't know what the hell you are, but...  And their little pal.  But he...  And their little pal, Jim Norton.  But he made that step forward when we were talking to the New York Times writer, this  guy, Randy Kennedy.  Like, we're getting ready...  Randy Kennedy.  We're getting ready for our New York Times article about a week and a half ago.  Yeah.  And Anthony and I usually sit down, and Jim Norton usually is like, all right, see you guys.  Bye.  I know.  And just leaves.  And all of a sudden, he gets the nice, comfortable chair.  He pulled up a chair.  Pulls up a chair.  It sits right next to the writer.  I'm like, wow, okay. 
[00:53:00]  Let me tell you something.  I got a few things to say myself.  Tough guy.  Unfortunately, he just decided not to use any of that.  I thought I had a couple of good points.  Like when I said, sir, you got to understand, these guys are fucking funny.  Yeah, that was a good point.  Well said.  And you know what?  Thank God.  The day this guy came in to check out the show...  I was very sick.  Norton was sick.  He could barely talk.  Because I think that helped the positiveness of this article.  Who cares? 
[00:53:30]  It's a great article, man.  And I got to credit myself, you guys thought it was going to be negative.  And I'm like, no, this guy was cool.  I know.  And you could see that he was enjoying himself here.  It's like, how is he going to trash you after he's having...  As far as the New York Times writing about shock jocks, this is the best article that  you could hope for.  Well, we hate the term, but obviously that's the angle they always go for.  But this guy did his research.  Instead of just the New York Post and all those other shock jocks, they listen to our show  for a couple days.  They find the most horrendous crap, print it up, and say, see, these guys shouldn't be on 
[00:54:00]  the radio.  Then they say, their editor cut it down to a sentence.  Sorry.  Yeah, sorry.  I did have something very positive I said.  Look, here's what I handed in.  I get that from reporters all the time.  Because after we get killed in the papers, they always send the article like, no, look,  see, this and this.  Here's what I wrote, but the editor did this to it.  But they know that the editor is not going to use any of that stuff.  But this guy decided to try to figure out what Ant and I are about, the show is about,  satellite radio is about, and I think he did a really good job.  You want to read a little of this, Ant?  Oh, sure.  We could goof on this. 
[00:54:30]  So it's the New York Times yesterday, the Arts and Leisure section, ground-controlled  Opie and Anthony.  They were the first to leave the mothership.  Now Howard Stern is joining their orbit.  Mothership.  He's going with the whole satellite thing.  Yeah.  To that or he thinks that you're members of the Nation of Islam.  Yeah.  It seemed just like the old days.  A caller was on the line and she and her husband had very generously agreed during a comedy segment  called Guess What's in My Pants to have sex so that listeners of a radio show and its  host, Greg Hughes and Anthony Cumia, could eavesdrop on all the fun, Anthony. 
[00:55:00]  Yes.  Before the sex got underway, though, Mr. Cumia asked, mock seriously.  Mock seriously.  I was at a speed of mock seriously.  You're nowhere near a church, right?  Ho, ho.  There isn't a picture of Jesus in the room you're in.  Is there?  He added.  Or anything.  I don't want anything religious in there.  Ho, ho, ho.  I'm hysterical.  And it comes across in print like that, doesn't it?  We need our crazy laughs for this.  Okay. 
[00:55:30]  The two hosts known as Opie and Anthony once had a bad experience mixing sex and religion.  You think?  Their highly popular afternoon radio show on NEW in New York was consumed by scandal in  2002 after a couple called in during a sex in public contest to say they were having  sex inside St. Pat's Cathedral.  Even by the outrageous standards of their trade, the two hosts say they sensed that they had  crossed a line.  We knew that morally it was wrong, said Mr. Hughes, known as Opie, because of his childhood  resemblance to Ron Howard's character on the Andy Griffith show.  I've got to write all that.  Yeah, I got that name when I was 11 for that very reason. 
[00:56:00]  Very good, Randy Kennedy.  I thought it was the other Opie.  Exactly.  There ain't one.  Did I really have to explain it?  I know.  You could just say, he said Mr. Hughes, known as Opie, and I think people could do their  own math there and figure it out.  The amorous couple were arrested and in the storm of negative publicity that followed Opie  and Anthony were fired.  That's right.  Wrong again, but we were canceled and we collected huge paychecks to do nothing. 
[00:56:30]  Yes, it's true.  Thank you.  I'll admit it.  Yes, it's true.  You did?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You got paid for five months and Anthony and I got paid for two years.  That's fair.  How does that make you feel?  Isn't that fair?  I got paid for six months, actually.  Six months?  And a good severance.  Not really.  I know.  The best part of us getting canceled after we did that thing, and I were in contracts  that they couldn't mess with.  And Norton had a contract in his possession that was supposed to be signed by Jeremy and 
[00:57:00]  Ken over there at the old place that was going to give Norton a 100% raise.  It doubled my money.  They were going to double his salary.  It was supposed to go through.  Oh, and they would have had to pay out that contract.  Of course they would have.  And corporate approved it.  Oh, this guy lost so much money when we got canceled.  Corporate approved it.  Corporate approved it.  It went through corporate.  They approved it.  They're like, yeah, no problem.  What had to be done?  Signed?  Well, Jeremy kind of, to be honest, I mean, was a little bit slow on the draw with getting  things done. 
[00:57:30]  So by the time corporate approved it and it came back, all I had to do was have Eatman review  it and give it back.  So I still have the contract with the amount in it and little lines with Sykes' signature  on it and mine ready to be on it.  Oh, no.  But had it not taken a month extra from Jeremy going, you know, getting it, you know what  I mean?  It would have been done.  And I would have seen all that money in the severance and it would have been a doubled  salary.  Oh, that hurts.  But as it was, I got the original old salary.  Which was awful.  Whatever.  It's fine. 
[00:58:00]  It was still, I made up for it in gigs.  It wasn't about that being awful.  It was just a matter of when you see it in paper, doubled.  Yeah.  Oh, that really hurts.  And they would have had to pay that out.  Yeah.  But it got like caught up in paperwork and then we got canceled and then like, well,  screw this.  They just ripped it up and said, tough.  I don't blame them.  I mean, why would they give me extra money?  I'm done.  So, I mean, they just, you know.  Oh.  All right.  Back to the New York Times article.  Often shock jocks who go too far just move on to a bigger radio station with a bigger salary.  That's right.  That's right.  But O&A's case was different.  They bravely went where no celebrities of their stature had gone before. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  To Satellite Radio where their show was revived this month on XM Satellite Radio, transmitted  digitally to special receivers in cars and homes.  You guys know all that.  Where neither the FCC nor advertisers have any power over what can be said or done.  The two major services claim just over 3 million subscribers.  Between them, XM, the more popular.  The more popular.  XM Satellite Radio.  So, O&A's move has proved to be a kind of tipping point for the new technology.  Just days before they signed up, Bob Edwards, the dignified alumnus of NPR's Morning Edition, 
[00:59:00]  announced that he also would move over.  More astonishingly, Howard Stern, the most famous name in American radio, and a constant  thorn in the side of the FCC, just this month accepted a $500 million five-year deal  to join the little dog company.  And I give half to Allison.  Allison.  And that's when we called Bob and said, Bob, we are very much underpaid, Bob.  Bob, what happened here?  Bob, you're not doing your job. 
[00:59:30]  Super Agent Bob Eatman.  You guys got a couple hundred million, though, right?  Oh, yeah.  Of course we did.  Look at us.  You saw my apartment yesterday.  You'd think I could have afforded some snacks.  Hope he's not spending it on food.  He's a snackless ass.  With all this on-air talent congregating in this new and still largely uncharted broadcast  realm, it's getting a little less easy to say which is the satellite and which is the  mothership.  You could get a bag of bugles or something.  That's why his name is Opie, not from childhood, but because we had to snack on grass like a 
[01:00:00]  bunch of hillbillies.  But what happens to shock jocks used to endless constraints when they're suddenly catapulted  into the other, Anthony?  We were catapulted?  In their new studio, here is where it gets good.  In their new studio on 57th Street last week, despite Mr. Kumiya's joking, nobody seemed  the least bit nervous about the Tennessee couple having sex on the air.  Why should they be?  Some people compare the emerging world of satellite talk radio with pay cable.  As on HBO, comedians can loosen up and use the kind of language they could never use  on the public airwaves. 
[01:00:30]  But a better way to describe it might be as a kind of wild west of the airwaves.  So true.  We're trying to figure this crap out as we go along.  The wild west.  We don't know what we want to do yet.  We don't know.  Never know.  We don't know if we want to kill all the engines yet.  Some engine will come up and put an arrow in your back.  Right.  We're thinking of putting smallpox in the blankets, but we're not really sure if that's  the strategy we want to use here.  It's the wild west.  Rape and pillage.  Or should we jump on our horses and just run the buffalo over the cliff?  Sure.  You know, we could do pretty much anything.  Did they do that?  Huh?  Run buffaloes over the cliff?  Yeah.  Just for the fun of it.  That must have been great. 
[01:01:00]  Because the Indians used to eat them.  You know, they depended on them.  So we'd do whatever we could to try to wipe them out.  Just run them over the cliff, shoot them from the trains.  Whatever.  Let them rot on the prairie.  That's not nice.  Eh.  That's what you got to do.  You do what you got to do.  Don't get rid of those savages.  Regarding decency standards, it's every man for himself.  And with Mr. Stern's arrival, the two major services know they may be headed for a big  gunfight.  At the OK Corral.  Yes. 
[01:01:30]  Big gunfight.  One in which their permissiveness of pay cable might begin to look prim by comparison.  By a six-gun robin.  You could back me up.  He's got a six-gun.  You got to see the guns we got loaded.  Mr. Kumi and Mr. Hughes say they hate to be called shock jocks, but for better or worse,  they are poster boys for the genre.  They were fired from another radio station.  I know, it's like Neil Armstrong going, I hate being called an astronaut.  I mean, come on.  I hate the term astronaut when I travel in space.  It's true.  We're trying to get away from that, but it's just not happening. 
[01:02:00]  They were fired from another radio station in 1998 after declaring that Thomas M. Menino,  the mayor of Boston, had been killed in a car accident.  Neil Armstrong, I couldn't come up with an astronaut in the past 40 years.  Well, no, it's just good that you guys compared what you did to the guy who landed on the moon.  I mean, that wasn't arrogant.  It was very appropriate.  I mean, gee whiz, we're like Neil Armstrong or Louis Pasteur, for Pete's sakes.  You know, us and Jonas Salk.  Right.  Sure.  We're both doing the same thing.  It would have been more accurate if you said, you know, we're just kind of like John Wayne Gacy. 
[01:02:30]  I mean, I know he raped and killed kids, but boy golly, could he paint.  Yeah, you never hear about his painting skill.  Why is it always serial killer this and serial killer that?  That's so true.  Oh, the Neil Armstrong comparison.  I'm really awful.  Well, you know, us and Einstein, really, you know, E equals MC square.  Stick it up your ass.  Both of them have their place. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, sure.  All right.  Well, so in courting, Mr.  This idiot.  So in courting, Mr.  Kumi and Mr.  Hughes, XM made it clear that there would be almost nothing.  The company would prevent the pair from doing short of outright criminal acts.  I think that the only standards are the rules that humanity has made for humans.  Mr.  Kumi has said last week, smiling wickedly after the pair's ninth show.  Yeah.  Oh, what is a actually did that?  I grabbed my mustache and twirled it and went, meh, ah, ah. 
[01:03:30]  Isn't that wicked?  Yeah.  How does one smile wickedly?  Yeah.  Eric Logan, the executive vice president of programming.  Who was over at Opie's party.  Yeah.  And had no snacks.  With his pregnant wife, his very pregnant wife.  Someone on Instant Feedback wrote, wouldn't it have been good if Eric Logan's wife's water  broke so then you'd have something to drink?  And we didn't even make her feel comfortable  She had to sit  I have like an L-shaped couch 
[01:04:00]  She had to sit in that corner  And the TV's to her left  So she has to turn awkwardly to watch the game  And you know how uncomfortable pregnant women are anyway  You really have to do something  My apartment's like the wild, wild west  Everyone for themselves  You could have had a little fruit there or something for her  Would you like some grapes or whatever pregnant women eat  A little feminine touch I think  Something helpful  Feminine touch might help in some way  In the apartment  You should have like a housekeeper come in  Maybe once every couple of weeks 
[01:04:30]  And she could even do some shopping  Some marketing for you  Stock the place up  Clean up so there's no rat food laying on the floor  I need a cleaning lady  You know, something like that  I need a cleaning lady  And then you could tell her  Look, I'm entertained  My guest and I would like some coffee and cake  You know, you could say you're entertaining  And she can go out and get some stuff  And then, you know, you'd be having a regular shindig  I'm looking for a cleaning lady 
[01:05:00]  Ben had a really good cleaning lady  I go, Ben, I need your cleaning lady  You know, give me your number  Because I want her to start cleaning my place  But I guess Ben hasn't paid her in like six months or something  No, that was thanks to Sirius  Oh, he was waiting for a Sirius paycheck that he never got  Well, Sirius is really good with paying their employees  But he won't give me the number of the cleaning lady  Because he's dodging her  You're dodging her  I'm dodging her  You are dodging her though, right?  Are you dodging your cleaning lady?  But she was pissed  Of course she was pissed  Because Sirius didn't send me a check for six months 
[01:05:30]  So why can't I have her number?  I mean, I'm not you  I'm giving her work  And I think she left Tom  Oh, she left Tom?  I'm dead serious  Quickly?  All right  She's probably a huge Sox fan  And went up to Boston, Opie  Eric Logan  The executive vice president of programming for XM  Held the same title at NEW's parent company, Infinity  When the old Opie and Anthony show was canceled  And he said he was happy about their being back on the air  His quote  I think what they're popular for is a unique kind of content  That we realize is not for everybody  But there is a market for it  That's a great way to put it 
[01:06:00]  I think he threw us under the bus a little bit there  It sounded a little like a tire hit my head right there  A little bit  I kind of heard that  He could have said we were funny and clever and intelligent  And at times they shove whiffle ball bats up girls' asses  Look, they're really awful and horrible  But someone listens to them  So that's pretty much what he said  Way to promote the show  How about putting up some billboards  Hey guys, you may think it sucks  But if you want to give it a shot  There's a confidence boost  He didn't really commit 
[01:06:30]  He certainly didn't  That's one of his two quotes  And I don't see him committing  You know what that sounds like?  That sounds like someone in upper management  That's thinking ahead  Just in case we do something really bad  He has an out  Look, hey, I said  Yeah, his quote again  I think what they're popular for  Is a unique kind of content  That we realize is not for everybody  Oh, let me rush out and subscribe to that  Yeah, sounds like a hot item  Unique type of what?  And then he says  But there is a market for it 
[01:07:00]  There's a market for it  You know, there's a market for it  Yeah  We don't get it  We don't understand, you know  But people like this shit  That's what he should have said  People like this shit  I don't know  Yeah  You know, like heroin  There's a market for it  There's a market for it  People want to use it  Right  Alright  Their show  One recent morning  Included many of what have become  Drive time comedy standbys  Mocking mentally retarded and gay people  Not mocking mentally retarded people  We're bringing them into the show  Paying tribute  Right 
[01:07:30]  Paying tribute  That's what we do on the show  At least we talk about them  I mean, nobody else acknowledges them  In the family photos  People look and go  Oh  And they just ignore the fact  That there's this spoiler of the picture at the end  At least we acknowledge them  And talk about them  You gotta put them at the end  So you can photoshop them out  You have to  And hopefully the frame  Will cover half of that dumb face  Oh my god  Oh god  Oh no  You'll notice  I don't care  Parents of retarded kids  Go out and buy the thickest frames 
[01:08:00]  That they can find for their pictures  They're not  They don't really care  If their kid looks stylish  Yeah, put a shirt and tie on him  He'll look like a businessman  You know  He works for  Duh  Incorporated  Holy S  That is bad  Alright  Drive time comedy standbys  Like mocking  I'm sorry  I don't think anybody's loud  Stop laughing at me 
[01:08:30]  Stop laughing at me  You stop laughing at me  Yeah, Jimmy  And that's funny  The only thing that can be  Don't laugh at me  Would be if she was that retarded  And De Niro sucked her thumb  That would be hot  I'm your do-right man, stupid  Now we gotta go watch Cape Fear  Jesus, I have enough movies to watch  Boy, was she sexy in that 
[01:09:00]  And she's sexy  Even as a retard  She was sexy  That was really hot  Yeah  When she's sucking on his thumb  No hurting here, Daniel  You're stupid  Yeah, Jimmy  They're yelling back at you now, Jimmy  How does it feel?  How does it feel?  Retards have the worst comebacks  Look, I'm not trying to be mean 
[01:09:30]  But as a parent  How do you not plant your fist  Into that face  Look, speak clearly  Enunciate  Say what you're trying to say  Get your point across  I'm sorry  I don't know  I don't think anybody's loud  Alright  Come on  House full of love  Is it really?  Sounds to me like a house  Full of missed birthday parties  They don't miss the birthday parties  They still have birthday parties 
[01:10:00]  Stick a helmet on it  Comedy is not accurate  They still have birthday parties  I mean being invited to them  Oh, the invitation must have got lost  Oh my god  I'm sure they have people  Come to their birthday parties  Right  They're always invited  They're invited to birthday parties  But they're told to be there  With a gift AP  That means after photo  Alright, well  Terrible  Their show, one recent morning  Included many of what have become  Drive time comedy standbys 
[01:10:30]  Mocking mentally retarded and gay people  Nothing?  Okay  Gay people?  No, not at all  I don't know gay people  We love the gay people  We sure do  Alright  Debating women's anatomy  And making racist remarks  Now, you know  Making a racist remark  Would be if you just sat here  I don't know  Kind of getting on a race  When you just talk about race in general  And add everybody's race into it  Absolutely  Except white  Except white  Well  Please  Got control of mine  Look at the  Oh, sorry 
[01:11:00]  He does explain  Oh, he does  And making racist remarks  Ostensibly  What?  As a way to make fun of racist or political correctness  Or both  What the hell word was that?  It's the New York Times  Spell it  Ostensibly  Ostensibly?  Ostensibly  Ostensibly  Ostensibly  I couldn't even figure it out  I had a tough time too  Maybe we can have Juliette Lewis come in here and enunciate that word 
[01:11:30]  Ostensibly  Wow  Is Mike Tyson here to try to spell that fine word?  Ostensibly  Ostensibly  Yeah  O  Very good  Q  L  Y  No, no, no  O S  Pi R squared  All right  But in addition to these bits  Most of which they could have done very carefully with euphemisms  Euphemism  I say euphemism to bust this morning, didn't you? 
[01:12:00]  Euphemism  L  No, no  P  Y  C  K  R  Why are you going to tell me that?  Yes, I'm not spelling it right  No, that's how you spell it  That's for sure, yes  Yes, Mike  Euphemism  Euphemism  On public airwaves  They were able on their new show to read verbatim and to great comic effect  Oh, he found it funny, I believe  From the obscenity-laced lawsuit accusing the Fox television host Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment 
[01:12:30]  Yes  Verbatim  They were able to have an old regular, the comic songwriter Stephen Lynch perform a song called Craig Christ  About Jesus' little known  Reprobate brother  Reprobate  Reprobate  Reprobate  Reprobate brother  F  R  C  Y  L  T  Q  He starts with an R, dude  Repro  Rocket 
[01:13:00]  Which probably would have got them fired by the third stanza on regular radio  And later, maybe because it was funny or maybe just because he could  Mr. Kumia recited all seven of the words that George Carlin once identified as the ones  you could never say on television  I did?  Yes  Hmm  Stephen Lynch, they mentioned his name, right?  Because he was good when I came in  Oh, Jimmy doesn't  No, I  Are you bummed that your name wasn't mentioned in the New York Times?  Let's get it out on the table  What, your name wasn't even mentioned?  No  Dude, why would I be bummed? 
[01:13:30]  Who cares?  Biggest paper in the country, Sunday Times, two of your closest friends with their big color pictures, twice featured  I mean, why would you want your name mentioned in the New York Times?  Oh, silly  No, who cares?  Who gives a hoot?  They really did leave him hung out to dry  That's okay, as long as Lynch gets mentioned  I mean, that's all that really matters  The guy who does nothing but get ass and sell out shows  You've been doing the show with us for three straight weeks  Here every day, dedicated  Very surprised by that, by the way  That you haven't missed the day, really  Except for one gig you had to do 
[01:14:00]  And Lynch came in for, I don't know, maybe a 15-minute segment  And he gets a nice mention in the New York Times  Yeah, but you know what?  The New York Times, I mean, it's not like it's the Daily News or the Star-Ledger  Right, right  You know, I mean, it's only the Times, how much circulation do they have?  No one's reading this on a Sunday, Arts and Leisure  Biggest article probably you can possibly get, which is the Sunday Times  Did I tell you it was on the front page of the Arts and Leisure section?  I noticed that, the two giant, actually life-size color photos of your heads  I couldn't believe that they put those great photos of my pals  Why did they leave him out?  Not necessarily to even say, oh, you know, in a little asterisk 
[01:14:30]  Their friend Jim Norton was there, just hanging out  No need for that, that would have just been...  All right  All right  But in an interview later, Mr. Kumia, 39, and Mr. Hughes, 37  Wow  Oops, typos  Typos  You're going to ruin it  Said that they were very much aware that doing talk radio in a medium without rules  Was, in many ways, as scary as doing one with too many rules  And worrying every day about being fired  On regular radio, where they became the top-rated afternoon drive program 
[01:15:00]  In nearly all male demographics  Many of their antics were shocking and funny  Simply because they were on a station anyone could tune into  While stuck on the Long Island Expressway  Getting dinged by the cars in front of you  I like the ages  What was in the paper right next to that story?  Challenger explodes  Oh, that is hilarious  I'm now officially younger than four out of my six siblings 
[01:15:30]  And it doesn't make them happy  I don't know what happened  That's hysterical  I was the oldest, but now I'm like the second youngest in my family  Well, and they say Greg Opie, who is 37  Was also enjoying the Wade Boggs ride around the Yankee Stadium  After the World Series  Shut up, dude  Rean it  You're going to ruin it, man  That's funny  But now, with listeners who have bought a satellite radio and paid a premium  And who are eagerly expecting the unexpurgated 
[01:16:00]  Unexpurgated  Unexpurgated  Wow, I got a lot of words to look up in my thesaurus when I get home today  Unexpurgated  Yes, Mike  The number one  No  C  No, we're trying to spell it  The at symbol when you put an email  And  R  Very good  Unexpurgated  Who's going to tell you no?  Very nice  What will be shocking enough, he asked  Shocking  And how can they please  Page three 
[01:16:30]  New bosses who almost expect endless outrage  That's what scared us, Mr. Cumia said  I didn't say that  This is what's really funny that a lot of people on the message boards picked up  This is Anthony's quote  That's what scared us, Mr. Cumia said  Because Anthony and I were trying to prove to them and everybody else out there that  Look, we're not shock jocks  We hated that term  We do so much more than that  But I'm speaking in the third person  Is that what I'm doing?  See, Anthony  What?  That was your quote  Yeah, I think I 
[01:17:00]  That's what scared us  I think that's what you said  And then I say  Because Anthony and I  But he got it all wrong  I know what happened  That's where  I think I said that  Oh, maybe Jimmy said that  And then we're going to say  I said that's what scared these two  And that was probably  He just mixed it up  Maybe we just didn't see your name  That might be it  Keep on listening  Your name might be in here somewhere  It might pop up towards the end  And the Oompa Loompa was quoted as saying  He gets a quote in there  And Jimmy gets nothing  And so on Saturday Radio  He said  The paradoxical 
[01:17:30]  Oh, so the subject  Is compelled towards good  By paradoxically being  Repelled by evil  Paradoxical  Yes, Mike?  That's what  A friend of mine in the army  He's a paradoxical  He jumps out of airplanes  And opens his paradoxical  F-R  At least it wasn't me saying it  It was Mike  And Mike's stupid, right? 
[01:18:00]  You were going to tell him  It was stupid  No, I'm not  And so on Saturday Radio  He said  The paradoxical result  Is that they intend  To play down stunts  And shock value  That were a staple  Of their old show  They know that  It will become increasingly hard  To top their own record  And they know that  When Mr. Stern  Their rival  With whom they've been  Engaged in a running feud  For years  Joins the little dog company  In 2006  The pressure to  Out-stunt the competition  Will only increase, Anthony  Right  Of course  Their show features  Lots of language  And subject matter 
[01:18:30]  They could not have  Touched on the public airwaves  But during the show  Last week  Mr. Hughes  Often carefully  And sometimes  Almost primly  Thank you  Primly?  That sounds gay  Almost primly  Avoided  Expletives  I know  Expletives  Expletives  Using euphemisms  Like freaking  Or effing  Even though he was  Free to spew  The foulest language  They could come up with  That's right  We say in the show  Don't curse just to curse  Right, Anthony?  Oh, here is that quote  Sorry  We've been telling our listeners 
[01:19:00]  We don't want them cursing  And we tell each other  Don't curse just to curse  Mr. Hughes said  Sounding far less like  The overgrown teenager  He sometimes plays on air  And more like  The experienced  Multi-millionaire  Entertainer  He really is  The experienced  Multi-millionaire  Entertainer  That he really is  All I would do  By the way  If that was written  About me  Is hang it on my refrigerator  Highlight that in yellow  And point it out  To every young piece of ass  That comes over the house  How you doing  Nineteen year old  Go get me a water 
[01:19:30]  Out of the fridge  Don't look at that article  Taped to the thing  Multi-millionaire  That's right  Teenager  Now beat it  I think I'm  I think I found  My first tattoo  It's the first  That's all I would do  Is show people that  New York Times quote  On my bicep  New York Times  Quote  Alright  I think that takes away  Multi-millionaire  With an aversion  To buying snacks  I think that takes away 
[01:20:00]  From what we are  Which is a very funny  Clever  Entertaining show  He added  I do believe that  By the way  Or is Mr. Kumia put it  Explaining that shock  Would be strategically  Rationed  I think  If you took a show  Like The Sopranos  And every week  Somebody gets murdered  It would get old  Right  That's a great way  To look at it  Yes it is  There's a shocking  Element to the show  He allowed  You allowed that  I allowed that  As a matter of fact  I was going to  Not allow it  But you allowed that  And then I said  Screw it  I'm going to allow this 
[01:20:30]  I'm going to allow this  And tell him this  You conceded  I'm going to share  A little bit about myself  I allowed him  To get into the inner  Sanctum that is my brain  I give it permission  But it's what we call  The attention getter  It's to get people in  To get people to spread the word  Then once they're in  Now they're listening to a show  That sounds like a discussion  Between their friends  Of guys  Talking about guy  Things  Which means if their  First shows are  Any indication  Chiefly pornography  Body odors  Bodily functions  Celebrity  Sports  Politics  And having sex  With prostitutes  That does sum it up 
[01:21:00]  If you're a real shock jock  Mr. Kumia said  Which is going on the air  Every day  And trying to shock the public  With an animal execution  Or some kind of sex ploit  Or something  Then you're going to have  A problem  Because people will expect  And try to see  What you're going to do next  At least at this early stage  Fans of the new  Opie and Anthony show  Seem to be liking  What they hear  Though some seem  A little disappointed  That the show  Is not more freewheeling  And that even on  Non-commercial radio  There are still  Promotional spots for XM 
[01:21:30]  The whole  Here's one of our listeners  I don't know where  They got this guy  The whole point of the boys  Going to XM  One fan wrote recently  On a website  Devoted to the show  Was that  They get to do  Whatever they want  And have control  Over their own show  It really doesn't seem  Like they have a lot of  Control over some of the  Aspects of the show  Example  When to take a commercial break  Hello  We've been talking  For an hour here  Yeah  And the type of clips  They get to play  During the break  It's kind of disappointing  To see something like this  As early as their first week  Sure being able to curse 
[01:22:00]  And talk about anybody  Is nice  But why not let them  Run everything like promised  Well we're still figuring this out  It's growing pains  We've only been doing this  Three weeks  And it's getting  You know more gooder  Every day  I love the people  That were bitching  About day one  About the show we did  On the first day  Did you read some stuff  People bitching about  The first show  No  With the technical glitches  And everything  God relax  Page four  Couple of weeks here  It's unbelievable  These idiots  They go to eatabullets.com  They write all these weird things  It's ridiculous  What site is that? 
[01:22:30]  Oh I don't know  It's just some fan site  But the consensus on such sites  Seems to be that the show  Is already beginning to find its stride  After the first two shows  Another fan wrote  I was thinking  Uh oh  They've lost it  See that guy  Just when I started paying for listening  But this morning's show rocked  More please  Uh oh  Back to Mr. Logan  If you were to listen to any show  That me and Opie did  When we first started at a station  Whether it was AAF  Boston  Worcester  Or even NEW 
[01:23:00]  When we came to New York  The first few shows we did  The first like weeks that we did  At those  Awful  Not uh our favorite programs  No  Were you a happy guy  On the first ones you were doing  I was the happiest little guy Jimmy  I was so happy to just be there  Eager  Eager to please  Hey  I'm here  If someone called and said  Good show  You'd be like  Thanks  No thank you  Thank you  Thank you  With his little lunchbox  He was ready to go  Yeah  Loved it  Now he's miserable like me  I love it  I'm all jaded 
[01:23:30]  I love it  I don't have the drive or energy anymore  Because I'm a multi-millionaire  So I just say screw it  I've turned him man  Yeah  He's just collecting a paycheck at this point  That's it  Just calling it in  Yeah we don't give a crap anymore  Yeah sure  Cool  I thought they were talking about me  I have to pay for Allison  Allison  Mr. Logan the XM programming executive said the show is already becoming popular  Which it is  But he declined to say how many people have subscribed  Right now our position is that we just don't disclose those numbers he said 
[01:24:00]  Though he emphasized that he expected to reach 20 million subscribers by the year 2010  Looking exhausted the other morning  They wake at 3.30am to do the show which they said seriously cuts into their beer drinking  Mr. Kumi and Mr. Hughes said they felt they were starting to figure out how to be funny in a world without censors  Or more accurately in a world where they were now their own censors in the name of better humor Anthony  Would they ever take another cell phone call from inside St. Patrick's? 
[01:24:30]  We'd like to say we have the guts to do anything Mr. Hughes said but the fact is no way  Very serious moment there  He paused and after a moment of reflective silence added  Now if it was a mosque  He and Mr. Kumi laughed uproarishly  I think that line being used in the paper  Ties it with Henny Youngman  Take my wife please  As the most overused line ever  I know I've been using that in 
[01:25:00]  I think it's in every interview  I think I'm going to use it on the John McEnroe show  This one's bad  It's good that you said no way too  That's a real mature man way of  No way  And he says way  He and Mr. Kumi laughed uproarishly  Ah that old gag Mr. Kumi said  Yeah Mr. Hughes agreed  That old gag  That old gag indeed  And that ends the article in the New York Times 
[01:25:30]  There you go  On the front page  Now we will read the crossword puzzle  No?  I thought we were going to do that  That was a very good article  Ah that was fun  That was very cool actually  He didn't trash us  Like we had fully expected  The New York Times to trash us  Because they're the Times  Right  You know we got an ally at the Post  With Minnelli  He usually hooks us up  But I think his editor has a little more power over 
[01:26:00]  What he prints  Yeah  Than the guy at the Times did  Daily News  I don't know  The radio section there  Seems a little too preoccupied  With what's happening  On the classical station  And what jock is coming in  At the one watt station  Somewhere on Long Island  Ah so they're a little too busy  To cover  The huge stories  In radio  Newsday  Who the hell knows  Have we even been written up in Newsday  We grew up on Long Island  Now they kind of avoid us  Peter Goodman out there 
[01:26:30]  Is a little too busy  I don't know  Discussing what radio  Is coming out of the  Montauk Point Lighthouse  He's too busy  Steering the ships away from the rocks  He's too busy grooming  His facial hair  He's got like  Some whacked out  He's got that  Raleigh Fingers  Well he does like  A sideburn  Into the mustache thing  Yeah  Without the goatee  Didn't he have the handlebars  And then I think  He was attempting  The handlebars  Snidely whiplash  He's got those  Handlebar things  That he twists into  Little curls  Curls  Right  Sounds like a real stepper 
[01:27:00]  Let's go to Mike in New Jersey  What's up Mike?  That's a good look for the 21st century  Is that right, right?  The big man  Hold on, hold on, hold on  Go ahead Mike  Another great show prep  For Monday morning  I just pick up the paper  And read it  I gotta find out myself  Holy Christ  Yeah I think every Monday  We're gonna just read an article  In the paper  Why not?  Eh what the hell  Another hour and a half  I got a little story for you guys  Honestly it just doesn't matter  You're already paying for the show  We don't even have to try  Yeah  You know what?  We're just gonna start reading articles  That's it  We don't have to try anymore  There's no ratings anymore 
[01:27:30]  You pay your $2 and we got you  Tomorrow A through D of the phone book  That's right  We dare you to cancel it  Just put us out of our misery  Just cancel the service  We don't care anymore  Right  I listen to your guys show  In little breaks  I get like an hour  Like your second hour  On the way to work  I get like the last half hour  And the first half hour  On the way back from work  And then I kind of fill in  On the weekend  So I kind of  I like Saturday  I'll be listening  And here's something  That refers back to what I heard  On Tuesday  And I get like a little laugh 
[01:28:00]  Out of it  So are you guys familiar  With the McGriddle sandwich  From McDonald's?  The McGriddle sandwich?  What's that?  What is the McGriddle sandwich?  It's a pancake sandwich  The bread is pancakes  And it's got little splooges of syrup  Built in to like scientifically  And magically put into the pancake  I don't know how they do it  But it's great  It's my favorite sandwich  It's the only thing that gets me up  In the morning  Anyway  Yesterday  10 o'clock in the morning  I'm driving  In the work  Eat my McGriddle sandwich  And little Jimmy 
[01:28:30]  As the first bite out of my mouth  That little splooges of syrup  Squirt in my mouth  And little Jimmy  Calls Patty C  I believe it was  Action Park for blood cots  Referring to her period  I damn near threw up  Perfect timing  Dragon in life  And perfect timing  We've eaten the sandwich  For the rest of my life  So  Thank you sir  Thanks Mike  Thanks guys  I did you a service  Believe me  Speaking of throwing up  From eating something  Did you guys see this  In yesterday's New York Post  Yep 
[01:29:00]  What  The segue  With this Opie  Is like it was planned  Thank you Anthony  Thank you  Bravo  Thank you  The guy talks about  His McGriddle sandwich  And how he almost  Puked eating it  Opie goes scurrying  Through the papers  And finds  This story  Yep  That's the professionalism  I'm so glad you see  My importance  That gives you  The multi-million dollar  Experience  I'm so glad you see  My importance on this show  Of course  Thank you  This is a tightly run ship  I'm one step above Earl  Pushing buttons 
[01:29:30]  But thank you  Thank you  Speaking of which Anthony  Yes  Yes  Gal finds condom and pastry  Oh  Can you imagine  Oh  A young Manhattan woman  Split open her breakfast muffin  Only to find what seemed  To be a condom  Baked inside  Oh my god  Yeah  That is really bad  Not only is it a condom  Oh they got a picture  Yeah  Not only is it a condom  Which is bad enough  Okay  Yeah  But if it was a condom 
[01:30:00]  That wasn't used yet  It would be all rolled up  Oh god  And quite frankly  I think  You could  You know  Throw the condom aside  And still enjoy your breakfast  Oh stop it  You are kidding me  You would  You would eat that muffin  If an unused condom  Was in it  Well if the line  Was really long  Why get back on the line  Oh  You see the condom  Wasn't used  Ah a little misfortune  You know  There's a penis in it  Are unused condoms  All out in the pastries  No sir  But this condom 
[01:30:30]  Was obviously  Oh  Used  It's a dead little fish  You know what she should have done  She should have like  Just squeezed it out  On top of the muffin  And said  I can't believe it's not butter  Oh my god  I'm in a puke  It came with it's own spread  I was going to say  You know  It came with it's own icing  Whatever you want to put on it  A little icing for the muffin  I'm getting the heebie-jeebies  That is really heebie-jeebie inducing 
[01:31:00]  Teresa Van Horn  Usually you know  When this crap happens  In the paper  You're like  Alright someone's trying  To get money  Yeah a lot of people  Yeah they do that  Really come on  You found a rat  In your McDonald's breakfast  Come on  Right  But it looks kind of legit  It's Teresa Van Horn  A 29 year old writer  At MTV Network  Said she was eating  A carrot nut cream cheese  That wasn't cream cheese  Oh  Oh stop  What kind of muffin was it  A carrot nut  Carrot nut cream cheese  Cream cheese top muffin  Who buys those  From her office building's bodega 
[01:31:30]  On West 50th Street  When she found a piece of latex  Baked into the crumbly delicacy  No extra charge  Alright here's where I got a problem  I ate almost half the muffin  Before discovering it  Oh  Good  Then she took a bite  Pulled back  And it snapped into her face  A la cartoon style  Boing  Then it was like  Spinning in her mouth  Like a shade  When you roll it down  And then  Dude listen to this  The window shade 
[01:32:00]  I ate almost half the muffin  Before discovering it  Then it was like  Slow motion  When I pulled it out  I was screaming  No  And of course  Because this is what  You need for the lawsuit  Since the incident  Last Tuesday morning  She said  She's lost her appetite  That crap is bull  Can't eat  Can't sleep  Can't have sex  No you get right back  Give me millions of dollars  Maybe you don't eat  For like a couple hours  But then the hunger pains happen  And then you're eating  You're gonna eat  I would have ran down there  And got another muffin immediately  Really  Yeah give me one without a rubber 
[01:32:30]  That's it  Problem solved  Yeah  Van Horn called the health department  To report it  But was told not to bother  Go ahead and throw away the evidence  A representative told her  Over the phone  Of course  Like they'd want to be bothered  With anything  Idiots  We won't get to your complaint  For days or maybe weeks  Yeah they just didn't want to be bothered  They don't want to be bothered  They just didn't want to be bothered  And it goes on and on  But there you go  Finds a condom and a muffin  And the stupid health department  Doesn't want to do anything about it  I don't care  What asses  So 
[01:33:00]  It goes on and on  But there's the story  Was it a magnum at least?  I don't know  Big boy  I don't know  It kind of looks shriveled  In the baking process  It looks like  It looks like it was definitely  Cooked in there  It looks like a used condom  And no one's weird  She said she ate half the muffin  But this  I mean look  She barely has a couple bites  Out of the muffin  And there's the condom  Sitting right next to the muffin  And then there's some crumbs  Pick it up with the condom  Pick up those crumbs  Get a good one  All right  More reading on the way  With the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:33:30]  Reading?  We're doing a lot of reading today  What are we reading next?  Reading is fundamental  Hooked on phonics  I've got to look up  A lot of big words today  A lot of big words  I'm trying to sound  More intelligent on this show  And man they gave me  A homework assignment today  That New York Times  A plethora of big words  Holy S  You know what's a big word  You should look up?  Party host  Might want to look that one up  And see what it says  See the definition of that one  Pay close attention  All right  Well  I've been to that apartment 
[01:34:00]  In the city  And it's a very nice apartment  Very nice  Thank you Anthony  And it has that look  That's what I'm doing  With my money  You'd think Opie was going  For a look  It's that stark look  Kind of  Yeah  The emptiness  That you might see in a loft  Or something  I'm a minimalist  It's a minimalist  Right right  But you realize  No that's just  He hasn't gotten anything  He has enough for him  It's a couch that he sits on  And a TV that he watches  It's all about  Me  And pop tarts that he eats  Anything else? 
[01:34:30]  Bring it over yourself  Pally  Just so  You ain't getting it from me  Awful lonely man  Alone in the apartment  In a pair of boxers  With a great little body on him  Eating granolas  Jesus  Maybe a Thomas' English muffin  Him and the rat  Just sharing something  Fighting over what shows  They're going to watch  Little rat hand on the remote  There you go  Alright  When we get back  We've got to talk about  Ashley Simpson  We've got to talk about  How Tupac's career  Is much better than Norton's  His career is great  And Tupac has been dead 
[01:35:00]  For what  Eight years now  But he's got another album  Coming out  Of course he does  And also  Who's pocketing all the money  All the PSAs  Yeah I love these  Very important  We'll do that in a little bit  We got some abuse PSAs  That were banned in Canada  Canadian domestic abuse PSAs  I saw the video  Public service announcements  I saw the video  I've listened to the audio  These can't be real  No I think they are  They really are real  Yeah they're very well produced  For spousal abuse  Or something like that  Spousal abuse  For spousal abuse  They have some PSAs 
[01:35:30]  What you shouldn't be doing  Right  Right  They're hilarious though  I'm sorry  They're really funny  Hilarious  Hilarious  And then Carlos Mencia  Checking in today  Carlos called  He has to call in tomorrow  Because his in-laws  And his whole family  Came in and surprised him  For his birthday  Well that must be like  Thousands of people  Right  Yeah and he's like  I can't make any noise  I can barely talk on the phone  So can I do it tomorrow  They called me  I guess it was a surprise  Birthday party  At a bowling alley in LA  And they invited me  I'm like well  That would be lovely  But I'm here in New York  In New York  That must be loud

[01:37:00]  His hands are moving  And then you're like  Ben what's the matter  He's like  I'm just having my coffee  Having an internal dialogue  That's acting out both parts  The best is when he starts  Laughing to himself  Like we're not even  Saying anything funny  He's there herky and jerky  At least we get to  Your Metallica story  He told himself a good joke  Oh he really is a psycho though  Nice catch silly goose  Watching football  With this lunatic  Dude it's all about the Pats man  I told you  Butterfingers  What sucked is  He's trying to eat sushi  With the little  You know  The little sauce there

[01:43:30]  Dude  You have to wait  I like to drink red wine  This girl says  Doesn't red wine give you a headache?  Yeah  Eventually  But the first  And the middle part  Are amazing  I'm not gonna stop  Doing something  Because of what happens  At the end  Mitch do you want an apple?  No eventually  It'll be a core  I went to the store  Bought eight apples  The clerk said  Do you want me to  Put them in a bag?  I said 
[01:44:00]  Oh no man  I juggle  But I can only juggle eight  If I'm ever here  Bought nine apples  Fucking bang them up  I saw a guy  Juggling chainsaws  It was cool  But unless something  Needs to be sawed down  Then it's just annoying  It's like  Come on Rick  Can we use one?  Track number five  Will not be  Chainsaw juggling  It will be this one 
[01:44:30]  I was gonna have my teeth  Whiten  But then I said  Fuck that  I'll just get a tan instead  I got some tartar  Controlled toothpaste  I still got tartar  But that shit's  Under control  If the tartar  Gets out of line  I'm like  Come on man  You know the deal  Fall in  You crazy ass tartar 
[01:45:00]  I got so much tartar  I don't have to dip  My fish sticks  In shit  That's actually  Kind of gross  After that joke  I always clarify  That I'm just joking  I don't know  How much tartar  I actually have  I believe  It's the average amount  If we all did  A tartar test right now  My name would be 
[01:45:30]  Right in the fucking middle  I would like to go fishing  And catch a fish stick  That would be convenient  I could easily get a job  With Mrs. Paul's  They just put me in a boat  With some empty boxes  And I would return them  To the freezer section  Of your  Neighborhood grocery store  You know there's a fishing show  On TV  They catch the fish  But they let it go 
[01:46:00]  They don't want to eat the fish  But they do want to make it  Late for something  Where were you?  I got caught  Bullshit  Let me see the inside  Of your lip  Fish are always eating  Other fish  If fish could scream  The ocean would be loud  And shit  You would not want  To submerge your head  Nothing but fish  Going  Ah fuck  I thought I looked like that rock  It's everything  24-7 
[01:46:30]  XM  202  The O&A virus  It's everything  All the time  Coming up next  On Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  Sing  Forget me not  You sightless taut  You dog just shit on my rug  Thought that was pretty  Fucking funny  Didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony show  You don't do sketches  Stupid  Give me film  Give me fire  Give me that one  That one's on his arm  Yeah  Metallica rocked 
[01:47:00]  On Friday night in Jersey  Wow  Got smacking Metallica  At that little arena  Down there in Jersey  Unbelievable  That's like the sixth time  I've seen Metallica  Where do they play, PNC?  Yeah  No, the Continental  Ah  Continental  Is that the only arena  You'll go to, Jim?  Hey, that's good 
[01:47:30]  Only fly Continental  Sully was absolutely amazing  It might be the best  As far as the best sounding  Live rock performance  I ever saw with Sully  Yeah  He's just amazing  Unbelievable, man  He's going to be on our show  Very, very soon  Him and Godsmack  And Metallica rock  Although, I think James Hetfield  Needs to start drinking again  Is he completely sober these days?  Yeah  Because he doesn't really know  How to interact with the crown anymore  Remember he used to be like  This tough guy on stage 
[01:48:00]  Yeah  Hey, you mother-eppers  You know, now it's like  He seems very detached from the audience  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah  He's just going out there  And doing the songs  And that's it?  No, I mean, he's talking to them  But it just was kind of weird  Yeah?  Yeah, he's kind of stiff  I don't have a really good example  It's just like Metallica  Hey, you guys are fans  And we really appreciate that we're here  Hey  Very just, I don't know  It was weird  Huh, that's odd  It was weird  Maybe he was having an off night  And then Lars had to bring his kid up 
[01:48:30]  To help him with Seek and Destroy  I think that  When he was playing Seek and Destroy  No one wants to see Miss Metallica's kids  Well, I think the kid just kind of ran up on the stage  And started, you know, just tapping on one of the drums  While Lars is just losing his mind  What, you think like that was spontaneous?  I don't know  I don't know  I don't think they'd let a kid run out  When there's explosives all over the place  Well  I actually think that was James' kid, actually  Really?  No, no  It was Lars' kid  It was Lars' kid  It was Lars' kid, yeah  Both his kids, I think 
[01:49:00]  Two of his kids  Because there were all kinds of kids running around backstage  It was all a bunch of little kids  They all had their families there  Wow  But it was a great show  And we had really good seats  Yeah  Godsmack's people really hooked us up  But I'm sitting in my seats just before Metallica  Well, first of all, we have to leave the city  I guess we should start from the beginning  Jesus  We have to leave the city at 5 to get to an 8 o'clock show  I don't know why  It's only literally right across the river here  But it was Friday?  Huh?  Was it Friday?  Dude, I understand traffic  But, I mean, the reason why we had to leave so early was 
[01:49:30]  You know, this dope over here  Had to get his stupid celebrity photos done before the concert  Oh, so you're trying to get there early  You need to get his celebrity photos done  I know you  You want to get your celebrity photos done before the concert  So you can sit there and enjoy it  And not obsess about  And think about the pictures for the whole show  And not obsess about who you didn't get backstage  Yeah  For your little collection  I like having a collection  So we go backstage  And we went backstage after Godsmack for a while  Is that how it happened?  Yeah, because  Well, Sully actually called me that day 
[01:50:00]  And told me he was leaving tickets and passes and stuff like that  So it was me, Ben, Ope, and comedian Billy Burr  All four of us went backstage after Godsmack, yes  Yeah, so he didn't get any photos done before Metallica  None  Yeah, but he had a chance  You kind of could have got Lars  We saw Lars  Now it was like 15 minutes  We go backstage  Sully had left immediately  Because I think he was with his girlfriend  Yeah, that was really good of him  Considering he invited us backstage  Because he wanted to say hi to us  So we go back  We do the whole thing  And I don't know, man  Right after the show, Sully 
[01:50:30]  He bolted  In fairness, he called me the next day  He's like, I'm sorry  I took off  He's like, my girlfriend wasn't feeling well  Nah, I'm just busting out  It's cool  But it was just funny that, you know  He had no intention of staying  So then we're getting ready for Metallica  We're sitting in our seats  And it was Ben and I in one section  And then Billy and Norton in another section  And all of a sudden a listener recognizes moi  Yeah  And invites me to the Skybox  Which is, I mean, perfect  Perfect seats  Dead center  Skybox  Food  Beer 
[01:51:00]  You know  So I call Norton  I go, come on up, man  Should have taken some notes, Opie  What happened?  On how it's done  Food, beer  Oh, yeah  So  I go into the Skybox  And I call Norton  I'm like, dude  We got the perfect setup  Screw, you know  Sitting in the crowd  We got this nice Skybox  You can sit wherever you want  You know the deal  Private bathroom and all that  Sure  Norton is the smart man  Because he comes in for 30 seconds  And goes, no way  And just leaves  No way  And leaves  And I didn't understand 
[01:51:30]  Until about five minutes later  And realized  Now I have to be the entertainment  In the Skybox  Everyone can't believe  For some reason  That I'm in their Skybox  Oh, now you have to perform  And I have to pretty much tell everyone  Trust me  It's no big deal  I'm a bore  I'm an absolute bore  And then  You get  Why aren't you performing  Why aren't you  Man, you're real mellow  Well, I'm mellow  Because I'm trying to watch the band  You know  But they're all excited  That I'm in there for some reason  So then  Taking pictures  Autographs  All that stuff  And I understood  Why Norton didn't want 
[01:52:00]  Any part of this thing  I am scrayed  I walked in  A guy threw his arm around me  And he's like  Hey, tell me a joke  And I'm like  Ah, goodbye  Hello  Goodbye  He was a nice guy  But he had been drinking  Since I think  Tuesday  Yeah, they were really cool  But yeah  Yeah, the booze was  Definitely a factor as well  And this is, by the way  How I know I'm becoming  An old ass  There's a Dunkin' Donuts  In the Meadowlands  And I buy a coffee  And I go into a rock concert  With a coffee  And I'm sitting there  Talking  Sipping my cup of coffee  With a cup of joe 
[01:52:30]  Waiting for Godsmack  And I'm like  I really am a finished idiot  When are they coming on  I've got things to do  Holy Christ  A cup of coffee  Did you yell  Darn you kids  When they were in your way  Well, people  Yeah, I'm like  Come on, sit down  And I'm trying to watch the show  Down in front  I can't hear  With all that shouting  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, man  What's going on?  Hey  I was at the concert  Oh, man  It was fucking horrible  Where are you sitting, Pete?  On the ground  Like on the ground level  Like right by the stage 
[01:53:00]  And there was just like  Mosh pits going on  The guys were getting like  Sumo tossed  Like over the railing  It was fucking horrible  Unbelievable  But it was the  I wish we could have heard  From the Bell Tolls  They didn't do that one  Man, they did a lot  Of great stuff  Yeah, I knew what  They were going to do  Because someone handed me  A set list backstage  You know  Well, I mean  It wasn't  I was the first  Metallica concert  I've ever been to  So I mean  It was fucking awesome  They were great  But I think if I would have  Had the seats next time  Maybe I would have  Sounded like in the stands  Instead of on the ground  But it was good  Well, it's because  The show was in the round 
[01:53:30]  The stage was in the middle  Of the arena  So then we go backstage  After Metallica  Because, you know  Jim Norton needs  His celebrity photos  Oh, he's crazy  With his celebrity photos  The backstage thing  Is so overrated  It's not even funny  They treat you  Like a piece of ass  They put you in a room  For like an hour  And you can't move  Or these guys  That are, you know  Think they're really important  Will beat you up basically  Because you're going to be  A threat to the band  They're just looking  To hit somebody  They really are  They love hitting people  It's very tense backstage  I hate going back there 
[01:54:00]  Nothing comes of it  People love also  What they love doing backstage  The security  They love sectioning off areas  That are accessible  To some people  But not others  Like you can be backstage  But you can't walk  Down that hallway  To use the bathroom  Oh my god  You just nailed it  Or you can be backstage  And you're technically backstage  But you can't go to the area  That the musicians are backstage  There's little areas  And when you try to cross in  They ask you for your pass  You show them a pass  No, not good enough  Yeah, but I know that  No, you're nailing it  Because when you go backstage 
[01:54:30]  The whole time  You're trying to upgrade  Your backstage pass  Right  Because there's sections  Like you just said  We started with the blue  Metallica backstage pass  That's a meet and greet pass  That gets you nothing  And then you want the all access  That gets you in with  All the other zeros  And just standing around  Hoping that the band  Is going to come in  And give you a little time  Yeah  So then Norton's managers  Are back there and stuff  And they upgrade us  To like a green Metallica  Backstage pass  And now we're thinking  We're in  But that pass 
[01:55:00]  Didn't get us past the curtain  No  They have a curtain  And that's where  The real action is  You want the  So we were in stage two  Out of three  Belly of a groupie  Pass is what you want  Right in the room  Stage two  Out of the three stages  We were almost there  So  And  So we're standing back there  And you know  Guys are getting all pissed off  Because you're not even  Standing in the right place  It's just awful  People think backstage  It's great  It stinks  It always stinks  Yeah you love it  Because you're a freak  And I'm standing there  With my camera  And open Ben 
[01:55:30]  Want to get out of there  Immediately  They're dying  And Bill kind of  Wants to hang  But he doesn't want to  Seem like a queer  Who wants to hang  So he like  Bill would have left  But he really wanted to hang  Because Bill's a nerd  Like I am  These two want to  Get out of there  Immediately  Yeah  Open's got like  He wants to go home  And do something  And Ben's got like  Three Colombians  With his mule  And eight ball form  He wants to get back  To the city  Everybody's got crap  Going on  And I'm just  I'm waiting for my pictures  I'm the guy that likes  Leaving before the encores  Even  I'm the guy that wants  To be  I'm that guy too  I want to beat the traffic out  If I could leave  Before the encore 
[01:56:00]  I am out of there  A lot of times it's like  They played seek and destroy  I love seek and destroy  But is it worth  Being in traffic for an hour  When you can leave  Before seek and destroy  And be home in ten minutes  I love when I'm  Speeding away  I'm speeding out  And you see all those cars  All those cars  I'm that guy  For all the people out there  I hope you realize  I went to the show this weekend  With my grandmother  And her friend  Not really man  I think a lot of people  Can relate  You know  Norton's  He is what he is  On our show  But backstage man 
[01:56:30]  It's scary  He's a completely  Different person  He's like  He's like a wimp  He feels like  He doesn't belong  Did he get his picture?  An hour and a half later dude  An hour  The show ended at 11.30  We had to walk out  With the actual band  Get out of here  The band is pretty much  The last people  To leave an arena right?  We're hanging out  Except for the  The road crew  I was going to say  Except for the road crew  But you know what  They pretty much had  Most of their trucks  Packed  The stuff packed up  Dude  They're very sufficient now  They're very sufficient  Are they? 
[01:57:00]  Efficient  Are they really?  Efficient  God damn it  No he was right  They are very  Shut up  Sufficient  So we had to walk out  With the band  With their kids  And their wives  Which just takes away  From your whole  Metallica experience  You see them all  Being fathers and stuff  Yeah  And they're running around  Because their kids  Are running around backstage  They're all concerned  Chasing them with  Little toys and stuff  It's like  This is Metallica man  Lars can't even  Stand up straight anymore  No  He looks like 
[01:57:30]  Like a question mark  They've been around  For quite a while  He's leaned over  The drum kits  A little too many times  His back is so arched down  Really?  And he walks around  Almost like he should be  In Lord of the Rings  Little hunchback  Great  So Jim's got his camera  And he gives everyone  A class on how  The camera works  Just so whoever's around  It's got to be  Snapped immediately  There's nothing worse  Than by the way  When you're standing  With a celebrity  And some ass  Is hitting the button  And shuts your camera off  And you want to  Brain them with a rock  If I ever miss a photo  Because someone 
[01:58:00]  Turns my camera off  I'm going to smash  Them in the gum line  With it  So yeah  I say here  Push the big button  You got to  It's all about timing  In these situations  He's so obsessed though  It's scary  I know  I've seen him  I'm like Jim  How long are we going to wait  We had to wait  An hour and a half  Just standing up  Against the wall  There's nothing going on  Let me see your  Live picture  I will show it to you  He did get excited  He saw Max Weinberg  Is back there  With like his kids  Trying to meet  So Jim goes over  And bothers Max  That was your first photo  Why not  He's Springsteen's drummer  He's standing right there  What am I going to do  Just two people 
[01:58:30]  Me  I'm the third banana  On a show  You drum for Springsteen  We're not equals  He's a star  I'm a nobody  They would have mentioned  His name in the  Fucking Times article  So I went and got  My picture taken with Max  You were on Jay Leno  I kept going to Jim  He plays on Conan  He's a band member  But I'm like  You were on Jay Leno  Talk your way back  Past that stupid black curtain  So you could get your picture  We could get out of here  Before Sunday morning  That would work  Hey big God  James is a personal guard  From New Zealand  I was on Leno  Oh 
[01:59:00]  Well excuse me  Let me get James away  From his family  And he'll come out  And talk to you  For a little while  Jay Leno wouldn't care  That I was on Leno  This is Metallica  They're a rock band  I didn't really think  That he wanted to be  Rejected in the end  No I didn't  It would go with  His whole persona  Absolutely not  He's trying to get his photo  And he gets rejected  And has to go home  Empty handed  Dude I want nothing more  Than my photos  Dude you were not fun  Back there at all  Because here's the thing  You were not fun  And Ben and I are laughing  It's work  It's work for Jim  We're laughing at him  Because he has a sweatshirt on  Right and he's got  His digital camera  Every two minutes 
[01:59:30]  He takes it out  And he studies it  He's like okay okay  No I turn it off  Or I turn it back on  It's on the right setting  Yeah you're turning it  Off and on  It's like okay okay  It's set  And he puts it back  And he just  Picture Hinkley  Doing the same thing  With his gun  Right  Before he's shot  He's just like  It's loaded  Our safety's off  So then Ben and I  Are laughing at him  And he's getting all  You know pissed off  Like you're gonna get  Me thrown out of here man  Yeah that's the whole thing  You're gonna get us  Thrown out  You guys are psychos  They look for people like you  If I knew how to delete that  I would have just done it  Oh wow  Imagine how pissed 
[02:00:00]  He would be  He wouldn't have pissed at all  It's already on my computer  Oh you did  Oh please  I'm Carl Coppy  As soon as I got this  Whatever  So I'm backstage  And actually a buddy of mine  Is actually Lars's assistant  He's a really cool guy  And he's like  Yeah man  He's like put me  Because they were gonna  Boot us out  Alright guys  Of course they were  If you were James  If you were Lars  So this guy Steve  Gets us into Lars's area  And um  You know people  Like there's some loud  People back there  Like one guy goes back  To meet Lars  And his friends are going  Hey look  He just leaves us  In the hallway  And I'm thinking  That's exactly why 
[02:00:30]  There's security here  You fucking dummy  You loud idiot  That's why  It's guys like this  This regular guy  Hey what  We can't go back  And meet him  No stupid  You can't  You're an ass  And you're loud  So Norn just stands there  And you know  His whole thing  Is making sure  He's not a problem  Which I think  Is making him  Look like a problem  Because he looks all  Like creepy and weird  I am creepy and weird  But I'm quiet  And I'm not causing a problem  You're a lot different  Backstage at a concert  Than you are right here  It was  It was  It was very strange 
[02:01:00]  It was an eye opener  And then you're getting mad  At Ben and I  Because we're laughing  Because we think  The whole thing is hilarious  It's like dude  You're gonna get me  Thrown out of here  How are we gonna get you  Thrown out of here  Because we're laughing  No because Ben kept saying  Alright dude this is great  We're just kinda standing here  In the hallway  Dude this is great  So we're in this crowded room  And people are starting to leave  Because the band's not coming  Anytime soon  I'm like Jim  When do you officially  Give up on this  So we can go home  Never  He never gives up  No  No I mean I would  Look when I went  When I went to Florentine  To Nassau Coliseum  We got James Hetfield 
[02:01:30]  We got backstage  Same thing  Hour and a half later  We got a picture with Hetfield  Yeah but that wasn't good enough  He needed the latest photo  With him and James Hetfield  No I didn't get James Hetfield  This time because he was walking by  I know but you wanted it  But I didn't  But he has rules  He's like oh he's with his kid man  No no no  I can't do that  I don't do kids  I don't take pictures  With little kids  Little kids  Guys with his kid  You're not gonna bother him  Plus he looks like he's a biker  And he wouldn't have went for it  If I thought he'd put the little tot down  And take a photo  I would have bothered him  It looked like his little tot  It looked like he wanted 
[02:02:00]  The distraction though man  He looked like he wouldn't mind it  So I finally  Lars finally comes out  Like Steve introduces me  Steve's like this guy's  A really funny comedian  And so Lars was really cool man  People say he's a loop  But he was very nice to us  And then Ben sees Lars  Standing there  And all of a sudden  The bug hits him  And he starts going  Dude that is Lars  He's right there  And he's trying to justify  The fact that he was  C-blocking this whole thing  He's like I wouldn't mind  A picture with him  I mean this is  Shut your face  Did you get a picture with Lars  Of course he did  Oh no wait 
[02:02:30]  But I never get photos  I only got a photo  I got Rodney once  And Jane's addiction  I never give a shit  Like you do about photos  That's even more inconsistent  I waited for an hour and a half  I wanted to get the photo  Dude our legs are getting  Our legs are getting tired  There's nowhere to sit  You should see the picture  It looks like Lars  Standing next to Stonehenge  With that big skull  With glasses on it  And Lars  And then Billy Burr  Wants a picture  Of course everybody  Wanted a photo at that point  Why not  An hour and a half later  And then it gets better  I make the mistake  Of telling him  I could see Kirk down the hall  So then we gotta wait  For him now  No well Jim Brewer 
[02:03:00]  Was there  Jim Brewer was there  And we're talking for a while  Dude he walked  Wherever he wanted  Cause he's friends  With those guys  He goes on vacation  With James  I'm like work it a little bit  You didn't want to work anything  I didn't  I'm convinced you  Could have got that picture  A lot earlier than you did  I didn't want to bust  Like Steve  I didn't want to ask Steve  Cause everyone's bugging him  So I'm like  Just hang back  Be mellow  It'll happen  When it's time to happen  I am so glad  I didn't go  I would have driven myself  Anyway  That's what Ben said  At Anthony's book  And drove ourselves  I never drive  With anybody anywhere  You hear what he says  And wait for it to happen 
[02:03:30]  That's the problem  Waiting for it to happen  Dude this is metallic  I've been a fan since  86, 18 years  There's nothing to do  Back there  For an hour and a half  We're there with Lars' dad  In the little area  Having chips and pretzels  And water  In the little area  And then so we're  Walking out finally  I got the picture with Lars  Hetfield is leaving  They're all leaving  And Jim's like  You didn't see Kirk  Brewer goes  You didn't see Kirk  I'm like no  Where is he  He goes  He's back there  I'm like oh my god  I didn't get to meet him  And Brewer's like  Come on man  And he just grabs me  We run back to where 
[02:04:00]  Kirk Hammett is standing  There was this one other guy  And I really embarrassed Brewer  I think  Because I'm like  Jim could you take a picture  And Brewer's like  Because it's his friend  It's like  So Brewer's like  Well you can ask him  And of course Hammett said yes  Because I'm like  This little blinky eyed idiot  Going could you have a photo  With you of Mr. Hammett  You know  And so I got my picture with Kirk  I got Lars  I got Kirk  I already got Robert Trujillo  At Ozfest a couple years  And I got James  And I got all Metallica  I'm happy  There you go  Now you got them all  I can put all four of them  On the wall  So what does that mean now  It's an obsession man  It makes me happy  We went to the after party  After 
[02:04:30]  Oh you did  Yeah  When the after parties  Are held after  Absolutely  Very good  Right after  But it was fun  I enjoyed it  Who was there  The whole band was there  Except for James  Yeah Lars  And Lars came late  But me and Billy  Went out to eat  We were both starving  And Ben wound up  Sitting at Lars' table  You know  You did  We were hanging with Lars  Lars is cool  I was falling asleep  Ben's at Lars' table  Falling asleep  Great passing out  But wait a second  The funniest thing too  Is Jim trying to justify  Waiting an hour and a half  After the show  To Opie  He's like 
[02:05:00]  Look man  If we left after the concert  We would have been stuck  In traffic for an hour anyway  Blah blah blah  Or whatever you said  So we theoretically  Waited for an hour  No no  We  Theoretically you left  Before the show even ended  We waited  Sure  We waited an hour and a half  And did absolutely nothing  I like the backstage area  I've had good luck  I tell you  I blend right in  The kids are running around  There's kids running around  The bodyguards just want to punch somebody  It's just not fun  Oh no but I'm here with the guy  I'm like innocent and stupid looking  Believe me  I told you when I first met Mike Tyson 
[02:05:30]  This is outside of Cafe Wad in New York  I was getting autographs back then  And I'm like I want to get an autograph  And his bodyguards are like  Nah man  He's not meeting anybody  And I actually said to the bodyguard  But he's the champ  You did not  I said but he's the champ  And my girlfriend  He's a completely different person  When he's doing this  It's creepy  And they're like  Nah Mike ain't meeting nobody  What are you little Ricky Schroeder  It really was embarrassing  He's the champ  And I actually followed him  To his Mercedes  And got an autograph  And he was very nice to me  I met Tyson twice  He's been nice both times  Makes me happy  I like my little celebrity photos 
[02:06:00]  Just a bit of a hobby  Punches his bitches right in the face  How do you not want a picture  With that guy  Hey guy that just takes what he wants  And plants his fist in people's face  Smile  Chris from New York  What's up Chris  Hey what's up boys  Hey  Nice to have you guys back  Cool  Hey listen  A few years back  We had a  Actually it was a  Merry Mayhem Ozzy  Kind of Christmas concert  Was that Rob Zombie and Ozzy  Yeah that's the one  Alright  We go backstage  And my friend's like  Hey man  That's Jim Norton  From the O&A show 
[02:06:30]  I'm not getting the hell out of here  I look cool  I didn't know what he looked like  At the time  He looks like a stalker  He looks like a pedophile  At the talent show  He's sitting there like  By himself  Licking his lips  Almost like touching himself  No it's weird  He's a different person  When it comes to  Celebrity photos backstage  Yeah we wanted to  Go over there  And say hello  But we don't want to  Be like no  I want to bother him  Alright  But he's just  Licking his lips  It was pretty scary  I actually played it cool  Backstage at that Ozzy thing  Because I met Jack  This was before the Osbournes  Was on TV 
[02:07:00]  And I didn't get a picture  With him  And I met Mike Piazza  And I didn't get a picture  With him  Because I didn't want to  Seem like a fan  Although I was  So I kind of  I tried to play it cool  And I missed two great pictures  Like an idiot  Alright let's say hi to  Lori in Wisconsin  Lori  Hi how are you guys  Pretty good  Thanks for waiting  What's going on  Well I just  Turned you on  Over the weekend  And I'm surprised  But I like your show  Oh thank you  How about that  I never heard of you before  Y'all didn't make  That much news  In Wisconsin  No  No  Not with all that news 
[02:07:30]  About cheese and all  If it wasn't for football  And domestic violence  Maybe they'd be able  To squeeze us in somewhere  Speaking of that  Y'all don't know  That much about truckers  What's that  Y'all don't know  That much about truckers  I'm a trucker  Well we're learning  Yeah  Well  I learned not to  I want Jim to come  On the road with me  Really  Where do you drive  Well I run mainly  Midwest to New England  I'm delivering refrigerators  In Hartford right now  I know not to drive  Through Missouri 
[02:08:00]  Or you might get  A shot in the head  Yeah isn't that something  Some woman trucker  Over the weekend  Was driving  Yeah she was driving  Her passenger side  Window explodes  And she  Pulls off to the side  Of the road  Her husband's in the back  Sleeping  And she started  Noticing she's bleeding  Oh no  She's like  Hey what  You know  What just happened  Maybe she thought  Glass hit her  Or something  Or something  Popped up from the road  And broke her window  Turns out someone  Shot through her window  Hit her in the head  Shot her in the head  But this big 
[02:08:30]  Thick headed  Woman trucker  The bullet  Bounced right off her skull  Wow  Bounced off her skull  She said  She had a thick head  That's what the doctors  Told her  But she was actually  The fifth truck  That got hit  Yeah and then  They put all this together  And they realize  A lot more truckers  Are being shot at  Probably some guy  In a Mazda Miata  Who got cut off  He got all angry  At the trucks  Yeah  It's a little creep  Be careful out there  So who's gonna come  On the road with me  I'll be your good buddy  You know what 
[02:09:00]  We wanna do  We were kinda  Talking about this  At my little shindig  Yesterday afternoon  We wanna put Steve  On the road  Cause Steve is the one  That loves this whole  Trucker thing  We wanna  Send him all the way  Out to the west coast  And back  With some trucker  I'd like that  Well he can ride  Along with me  Although I have to tell you  My handle's Barbie  So I have  Pink furry dash  And Barbie dolls  But  We'd have to share a bunk  Do you look like Barbie  Or are you built  More like the dream house 
[02:09:30]  Nah I'm not  Your typical female trucker  What do you look like miss  If I may be so bold  Well I mean  I'm not the best  Looking woman  In a group  But I'm above average  I have blonde hair  Blue eyes  36 C  Weight  I'm 5'6  I weigh about 130 pounds  Okay  Cool  Could you send us a picture  Well  How am I gonna get you a picture  She's on the road  No I know  When you get back to your crib  No I could

[02:10:30]  Seven months ago I guess  Jeepers  And uh  It was a guy  I was dating  Uh  Another trucker  Yeah  Excuse our interruption  We just saw the  Erection inducing footage  Of this queer  Dropping the chick  On the ice  On her stupid  Scandinavian face  How great was that  Ice skater crashes  You dropped something  Anybody see the footage  Where they're skating  In a circle  And he just trips  And she has her hands  Held by her sides  And right on her dumb face  Look at her  With her big black eye  Like she didn't shut up 
[02:11:00]  Looks like she was  Talking during the game  Doesn't it answer  Yeah got her sunglasses on  And a mouse under her eye  Oh she really caught  A nice fat shiner  Wow she is  Really really hurt  Oh he dropped her  Right on her face  Damn I missed it  That could be the best  Footage I've ever seen  Alright so uh  Laurie  Yeah  So it was another trucker  Yeah it was  Alright  And you probably  We'd try to meet  In the middle  But that's a little hard  Yeah 
[02:11:30]  Alright  Well uh  We'll put you on hold  Okay  Alright yeah  Cause I'm serious  You know  You all could learn  A thing or two  From some of these  Guy truckers  Let me tell you  Learn a thing or two  We're looking for a trucker  That's gonna go from  Pretty much the New York area  All the way  To the west coast  And we wanted  And we wanted  To put Steve  On the rig  What does he look like  Um  Steve's a big guy  He's a Lebanese fellow  With thick fingers  And he has like  Silver jewelry  On his fingers 
[02:12:00]  Like those like  Weird silver skulls  You see in flea markets  When you're 15  He's got tattoos  On his arms  Oh that  That doesn't bother me  And he wears  His shirts with flames  On them  Yeah  Not today though  Oh  He's the one  That wanted the flame boots  Yes  Yeah there you go  Alright  Is he single  Yes  No  Because we have to  Sleep together  Not yet  Not yet  No he's single  We have to sleep together  Steve's motto is  I may be married  But if she ain't here  I ain't officially married  Oh 
[02:12:30]  Oh there it was again  Okay they just showed it again  Wow  Did you see the footage  Of her falling  Oh did that look painful  Right on her face  Oh it's the greatest thing  I've ever seen  Her head bounced  That's the reason  Anybody watches ice skating  By the way  It's to one day see  Some homo  Drop a chick on her face  You watch skating  For the crashes  That's the only reason  I watch it  It's like hockey  For the fights  You just want somebody  To fall  And it happens all the time  And they're calling it  Miracle on ice  What's the miracle  That they worked  For all these years  And realized  They had no talent  They stink 
[02:13:00]  It's not a miracle  That she survived  She really got screwed up  That's nice  I like that  That was a hot video  Uh  Lori  Alright so we gotta  Set this up  Cause there's insurance  And stuff involved  Just in case  Insurance  Alright  I don't know if Steve's wife  Is gonna allow him  To go on the road  Yeah  Steve's a man  Who does what he wants  To do in his house  Can we wait  Until a picture shows up  Oh  Alright Lori  Hold on alright  Yeah she'll send us a picture  Yeah  But Steve  Would you take a road trip  All the way out  How long of a road trip  Are we talking about  We're talking 
[02:13:30]  You know  Six weeks  Nah  No  How many days  Does it take  How many days  Does it take  To get a  Ride from  Here to LA  You could do that  In probably four days  Right  Probably  They'll do  Yeah  Maybe four days  Are you up for this  Yeah  You hit the road  And then give us reports  Yeah let's  Wait for a photograph  Please  No we're not with the chick  We're gonna get like  Some dude  Am I being punished  Did I do something wrong 
[02:14:00]  Share the bunk  Share the bunk  Sure  Wow  You'll have to take dumps  In the bunk  Shower in those awful  Trucker places  Bring your flip flops  You're obsessed with  This whole trucker thing  Alright alright  They don't have any  Cool doodads you'll buy  That's true  You know what  I'm kind of warming up to this  I didn't really understand  What I was walking  Into the studio before  You're obsessed with  The trucker's life  And the truck stops  And all that  So we figure it's time  To put you on a big rig  With one of these fellas  Hey guys  Here's a knick knack  From south of the border  Yeah  Okay 
[02:14:30]  Why not  Come on  And then we'll just  Fly you back from LA  Yeah that's fine  That would be fun  Are you going to find  Continental  Because I'll go  Jesus Jim  Yeah why not  Alright  We're going to try to  Hook it up  We'll find a trucker  That's going to do  Like a  Coast to coast run  I don't even know  If they do coast to coast runs  We'll figure it out though  We're going to put them  We're going to put them in a day truck  In one of those little teeny cabs  That have no bunk to sleep in  My father took me in his truck one time  Gave me a little ride  Little ride?  Yeah  We're on his lap  And you were steering  No no no 
[02:15:00]  That was the neighbor  And we weren't in the car actually  He was just showing me how to drive  In a chair  In your living room  While he was babysitting  Alright  This makes the car go vroom  Ashley Simpson  SNL screw up  She ate it so bad  Right  Saturday Night Live  This is great  She's  You know  I think she's trying to capitalize  On the sister's popularity  With her little TV show  You know what  I don't even think she wanted to be  A pop star  I think it was those stupid parents of theirs 
[02:15:30]  Do you think they whipped this up for her?  Oh their Hollywood mom and dad  It's a Hollywood mom and dad thing  All the way  They got Jessica Simpson  You know very famous  And now it's like  I worked once  Let's try it with our younger daughter  Pump the other one out there  Ashley Simpson  SNL screw up  I don't know about you  But when I'm faced with the realization  That all of America  Is about to discover  What a fake I am  I don't normally break out  Into a weird Irish jig  By the way  The video is up  On opianthony.com  Is that her trying to  Foundrymusic.com 
[02:16:00]  She panicked  She's like  Oh my god  Is that her trying to say  She wasn't lying though?  Huh?  Or she wasn't faking?  They're trying to spin it  Her publicist and all that  Are trying to spin it  That you know  It was supposed to be  An acoustic track  Whatever  Alright so it goes on  And yet that's exactly  What Ashley Simpson did  During the horrific disaster  That was the SNL performance  I don't know who's to blame  But here's a recap  Of the whole thing  Ashley's lip syncing track  Starts playing  Before she even  Puts the mic to her mouth  And it's not even  The right track  So it starts fading out  And then the band 
[02:16:30]  Gets confused  So they start playing  But then Ashley Simpson  Is a dumbass  So she does a little jig  And then walks off stage  While her band continues  To try and salvage  The whole thing  I shit you not  This really happened  I know  We've all seen the video  By now  She was coming out  To do her second song  Yeah  And they had her lip syncing  Track queued up  To the first song  To the first song  So all of a sudden  She's walking out  With the mic  And it's already  The singing kicks in  For like only a few seconds  I think  We have the audio  But I think the video 
[02:17:00]  Is much better than this  Oh the video is classic  And if she was for real  By the way  And it was a mistake  She would have just  Stopped and goes  Hey what are you guys doing  Hit the play  The music  Start over  And if she's really singing  Just start the song over  And she'll start singing  I bet you her mic  Wasn't even on  Of course it isn't  Those mics aren't on  She's not singing  It's lip syncing  That Irish dance she did  Like the little  The little elephant  Traipsing around  It was  Oh she was  Sinking  She's cringe inducing  She ate it man  I felt uncomfortable 
[02:17:30]  At home  You know what would have been better  If some gay guy  Had picked her up  And slammed her face first  On the ice  That would have been  More dignity salvage  And if the revelation  That she can't sing  Wasn't bad enough  She tries to blame it  On her band  Yeah then she blamed it  On the band  My band started playing  The wrong song  And I didn't know  What to do  So I thought I'd do  A hoedown  They didn't start  Playing the wrong song  No they were  Playing the right song  The track was wrong  They weren't even  Ready to play yet  She's spinning it  She's trying to make it  Seem like the band  Played the wrong song  The band played  The right song 
[02:18:00]  The vocal track  Kicked in  And then they pulled  The vocal track  Out of the mix  The band keeps playing  She could have joined in  At any time  At that point  If the mic actually worked  She could have jumped in  Started the song  But she wasn't singing  She never intended to sing  The mic wasn't checked  For a singer  It was just a prop  It's a gag in her hand  Well she's also a prop  Yeah  You know  She's a  Making believe  She's a pop singer  Is it a big deal  To get all upset about  For her maybe 
[02:18:30]  Well yeah  I don't think  I think everyone else  Is making quite a big deal  I just think it's hysterically funny  You know  Who cares if they're  Pimping her out there  As a phony  With lip syncing  If you want to  If you're entertained by that  And you want to pay  A lot of money  For a ticket  And go to a show  And see somebody  Lip sync  To watch somebody  Do karaoke  Eh feel free  Go ahead  But then  The artists  Shouldn't present it  Like they're really singing  All these chicks do it  Madonna does it 
[02:19:00]  Britney lip sync  They all do it  Madonna used to sing  She used to sing  I think you're right  In the older days  You know  You guys tease me for Ozzy  Does he lip sync  He just stutters through  He mixes up the words  But he really sings  That's somebody who should  No  Now I'm stepping back  And saying  You know  Maybe in some cases  It is good  Ozzy should lip sync  Did Sully lip sync  All these  These talentless  Nice titted pop stars  Who have nothing  With their looks  Britney Spears  Total lip sync  She's got that  Stupid  Headset mic on  Like she's  Air traffic 
[02:19:30]  Like she's  Trying to land planes  And she  She dances  So much  And so hard  And it's such  Hard work for her  Because she's talentless  That she can't sing  She's all out of breath  When they're done  With the songs  She's been singing  These songs  And being very  Dynamic vocally  And  I'm sorry  Jesus Jimmy  You just stunk  This fucking place up  No I didn't  I just sneezed  No I smell something  That's the smell  Of your sneeze  She farted  I didn't fart  Who farted 
[02:20:00]  Not me  Who did it  I didn't fart  Was it Ben  Before he left  It is so bad  This is what sucks  About doing mornings  I'm sneezing  There's so many more  Farts going on  No dude I didn't fart  I wish I did  We're having a very  Very  We're having a very  Highbrow conversation here  And you had to ruin it  With a fart  I didn't ruin it  Wow somebody did  When have I not claimed  The cancer  He does claim  I know he claims it  I don't claim it  Put your granola  So you were saying it  Yeah when she finishes  When Britney finishes a song  You hear her singing  And it's perfect 
[02:20:30]  And she's dancing like crazy  Flinging her head around  And then when she's done  They turn her mic on  And she's like  Thank you  She's panting  So it's obvious  During the song  She's lip syncing  And then they just deny it  Like they're not lip syncing  Well cause you know  You're stuck paying  A lot of money  To go see these people  Christina Aguilera  She doesn't lip sync  She sings  Because she can sing  She's got a great voice  Well here's the audio  I don't know if it's gonna  Really work on the radio  Cause the video is just classic 
[02:21:00]  Once again it's up on  Opieandathony.com  Ashley Simpson eating it  But let's try to see  If there's anything here  Okay  Once again  Ashley Simpson  On a Monday  I am waiting  Tuesday  I'm there  Oh  Got the mic down by her hips  Right there they realize 
[02:21:30]  Oh my god  We're playing the wrong track  So they faded out really fast  Now this is the beginning of the song  If her mic was live  She could've come in right here  But here's the problem  Here's the problem  This is the song she already sang  Yeah  This is the song she already sang  Which makes this even worse  The band is now playing  The first song  Oh yeah  I can't even tell by the music  They panicked  They panicked and started  Playing that song  Cause they heard the vocals  Kick in  So they're like  Oh my god  Alright let's just start  Playing that song  But that was the song 
[02:22:00]  She already did  That's what makes this even better  And if her mic works  She could've went  Excuse me guys  Guys  Play the right song  You bunch of dimwits  Right  But there was no battery  In the microphone  So she can't even  Of course not  She can't even like  Try to talk her way out of it  So that's probably  Why she did the Irish jig  Like I gotta do something here  It was a Mr. Microphone  So and then there's a clip  Of her blaming the band  I think  Or maybe this was Jude  At the end of the show  She should've just laid down  On her back  And started fucking herself  With the microphone  Right there on stage  Absolutely  Now that would've been  She should've done a striptease  Yeah yeah  Then today we're like 
[02:22:30]  Who cares  She would lip sync  But man what a set of hooters  Right  Who's Jude Law by the way  Who's Jude Law  He's an actor  Oh it's a he  Yeah  I swear I'm not even being funny  He's an AI  Did you ever see that one  No  Look at you  No no  And I'm not even gonna  Discuss it with you  I'm too good for that  AI was creepy man  Ugh  Yeah  That movie creeped me out  Just sitting at the bottom  Of the water  Knowing that you're just  Gonna be dead for thousands  And thousands  And thousands of years 
[02:23:00]  That's why I don't smoke pot anymore  Cause that  Sober that freaked me out  I think you would've liked AI  With little Haley Joel Osmond in it  I wanna see the sequel  DS  Okay  What is that  Oh  What  Dumb shit  No  No  I'm missing it  Completely  AI  And the sequel is DS  Oh my gosh  Yeah  I wasn't spelling  You have to sometimes spell on this show  You gotta spell it out for me 
[02:23:30]  Alright so  Very funny Jimmy  Just cause it would look good on the box set  You know  Here's audio of blaming the band  I'm not sure if this was Ashley or somebody else  Let's take a listen  Ladies and gentlemen  What can I say  Light TV  Exactly  I feel so bad  My band started playing the wrong song  And I know it's good  So I thought I'd do a hoedown  I'm sorry  She said so  Oh  Wow  What a douche  And then she blames it on her band  Blame it on your band 
[02:24:00]  That's probably making what  Minimum wage  Ten grand to follow you around  You piece of ass  Shallow  No talent  Bitch  You blame it on the  You should just accept responsibility  Blame it on the band  It's obvious that  It was a vocal track that kicked in  And the band had nothing to do with that  I bet you she was such a little brat  I was talking to someone last night about this  I'll bet you  You could just tell right there  That's exactly who she is  Yeah  She was probably a little snot  Around the set  And it wouldn't be surprising  If some 18 year veteran  Who works the board 
[02:24:30]  But you know what bitch  Click  Track one  Watch what I do to you now  Someone that's union  And above being fired  Some of these guys you can't fire  I mean you know  Sure  So  Hit the other button  It wouldn't surprise me  I told her to put the new one in  She didn't  I don't know what happened  Traipsing around  Dad do a hoedown  As your career goes  It was appropriate  That she was kind of  Spinning in a circle  Because that's the same movement  Things make when they go down the toilet  And that was exactly  What was happening to her  Bye bye  Bye bye  Bye bye  Bye bye now  Bye bye  Fraud  You had fun 
[02:25:00]  Bye bye  Oh that's great  Lip syncing  On a Monday  I watched that Britney Spears thing  That was on HBO  Or Showtime  You seen that one yet  Of course  Where she pretty much does a  It's soft core porno  That's why I said of course  It's what you would see  The old motel sex videos  Yeah  Not hard core  Just a little soft core  And she  She was wearing this body suit 
[02:25:30]  I guess  That is skin colored  So she's supposed to look naked  And she does these sex moves  And lets black guys come up behind her  What?  And hump her like they're doing her from behind  And having sex with her  It's amazing  There was just an interesting story about that  On 60 Minutes last night  Something very similar  That happened in the south  To that till boy  In the 1950's  Whistling at a white lady  Well now  I guess it's carte blanche  You're free to 
[02:26:00]  Have anal  With Britney Spears on stage  But she sings nothing  And there's  There's little kids in the audience  And she's not singing at all  The singing isn't the important part  It's  It's  How you can  Have a black guy  Hump you from behind  On stage  This guy  Back to Ashley Simpson really fast  Let's go to Joe in Miami  Hey Joe  Hey how's it going  How do you do Joe?  I like you on the real world  What?  Huh?  Go ahead  I don't know  I was just thinking that it was funny  That you know those guys on Ashley Simpson's band 
[02:26:30]  Didn't get into music  To play for Ashley fucking Simpson  Nah  You know  So  Well the parents put that band together for  The parents did everything for this girl  Yeah but you know  There's musicians that wanted to be in rock bands  Or something  They took Jessica Simpson  The parents took Jessica Simpson's money  And hired the best producers  Got the best record company involved  Hired the musicians  You know  This  Ashley Simpson  She's a fraud  Although I will say her band  They don't look like to me  Dedicated rockers  Like a bunch of 
[02:27:00]  Metorosexual fruits  Yeah  Who got what they deserve  Which was to hook up with a non-entity  And embarrass themselves  By strumming the song  That was obviously the wrong one  So they got what they deserve  You finally make it to SNL  You finally make it to SNL  And that's what happens to you  And shame on NBC  Shame on you for promoting this bullshit  When there's so many real artists out there  And great singers  And that's the nonsense you put on your dumb show  Shame on them for saving her by going to commercial  They should have just let it keep rolling 
[02:27:30]  Let the misery continue  I would have followed her backstage with the camera  Oh yeah  You want reality TV  Come on  Where's the footage of her crying backstage  Oh you know she probably burst into tears  And running into the bathroom  Mommy  And by the way  I should have my head caved in  For saying shame on you  Like I'm some awful news story  At 5 o'clock  Shame  Shame  Shame  Shame  Shame  Did you shake your finger  When you said shame  Shame  I really am a faggot  Shame on you NBC  Kind of strange 
[02:28:00]  A graphic popped up when he said that  Shame  Shame on you  A lot of people asking where they could find the video clip of Ashley Simpson  Well that would be on opieandenthony.com  Which will bring you to I believe  Foundrymusic.com  Foundrymusic.com  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com  And you can find the  Oh we have an update  Thank you  What's the update Opie?

So post them as a comment so I can read them all and reply to as many as possible  She's talking about our message board  Of course  Right now that's out of the way  Okay  I know I said I'd never do it and spoke down about lip syncing 
[02:29:00]  Which she did by the way  Yep  She said she would never lip sync and she used to make fun of people that did  Liar  A la Brittany and all the others  Okay  I know I said I'd never do it and spoke down about lip syncing  But I do not sleep very much  I like how you put the lilt in your voice like a chick talking  Oh thank you  You're doing like a character almost  I'm trying to do more characters  I like that  Thank you  I'm so glad you noticed  Good call  I didn't notice that  It was a little feminine lilt  Yeah  I wanted to be  Like dear diary  I kind of wanted to be just subtle enough 
[02:29:30]  It was  Where it wasn't like my regular radio  Thank you  Yeah  Thanks  I practiced this in the shower today  I'm really glad you noticed  It was a lot of hard work  Thank you  Go ahead A to the S  I know I said I'd never do it  But I do not sleep very much or haven't been doing much recently  And I've traveled a lot and done so many things  Yeah  I have a lot on my mind with things that no one else knows  I did not feel up to it  Are you kidding me?  A live performance on NBC you didn't feel up to? 
[02:30:00]  Because she's stupid because she's a stuck up bitch  A spoiled brat  So just in case they have these vocal tracks available  So mommy's there to save you  Because you're not feeling up to being on SNL  Liar  That's why I hate musicians  Comedians can never do that shit  And we can't live on the same tired song for 40 years  Oh they make me sick most musicians  Lip sync your act  Lip sync your act  And then do the same jokes every time  God they stink  She's uh 
[02:30:30]  Yeah she's uh  Digging the hole deeper here huh  Imagine getting the chance to sing songs you wrote and record on SNL in front of millions  Than the day before almost losing your voice or at least not being able to sing to your full ability  Ugh  And before anyone says it I can sing so fuck you  Oh that's good  Oh she's saying  That's it  Get angry because you got caught bitch  Oh that's good  Let's find the Ashley Simpson website  Is that what she just said  That was the end of her open letter  No it goes on  And fuck you  I'm not gonna lie and say that a big must for me is 
[02:31:00]  Oh wait what am I  Okay I'm not going to lie and say that a big must for me is record sales  It's the same for any band  I guess  So the best option was to go with the lip sync and hope it went alright  Oh she sucks as a human being  Wow  Oh good she's so done  What an insincere nothing  It didn't  What  It didn't  I looked a stupid little  It didn't  It didn't go well she's probably saying 
[02:31:30]  Oh wait wait  Yeah but it's a new paragraph  Alright so she  And hope it  Okay hope it went alright  But it's a new paragraph  This is still  Well she can't sing or space  Okay  Obviously  Okay so alright  So she did the lip sync and hope it went alright  It didn't  I got it now  I looked a little  I looked a stupid little girl but I have accepted that  Worst things happen  Instead of totally focused on getting to me on my website  Focus on who to vote as your president or something  Oh  Oh  Yeah that's right  It's not about lip syncing 
[02:32:00]  It's about terrorism  Yeah and Al Zarqawi should lop your head off and hold it up  And go look at this  She's singing as realistically now as she did on SNL  Bitch you stink  The nerve of you to mention the presidential election  Wow  And my ego may have fallen but so do those towers  You stink stupid  Wow  Don't rope in the presidential election  Wow  Worst things happen  Instead of totally focusing on getting to me on my website  Focus on who to vote as your president or something  Or something  Say something nice to someone today maybe 
[02:32:30]  Okay how about this  Whoever you are  You sing better than that little twat  Is that nice enough for you?  Realize I am holding my head high through my most embarrassing moment live on national TV  But it has passed now  No it hasn't  I'm ready to move on and make it up to myself  Can't you move on?  Uh  No  See this is a girl that has never had to hear anything bad in her life  Parents protected her all the way  What a non-working for it snot  All right 
[02:33:00]  Can't you?  It's only two days later  I can see if this happened in 88  But this is two days ago  Yeah  No we can't move on  If you want to make any comments  Please post them in this post  And let's all just move on  It really can be  No  Fuck that  Is as simple as that  Whatever  See you all soon  And thanks for the support  To the majority of people who are giving it  No one's giving you support  And then she resigns it  Ash  Ash  Aw  Is that her little name?  Ash XX  Just the fact that she can't admit  Look I stink 
[02:33:30]  She is finished  She'll be spreading them in Playboy or something  You know what you're right  Pretty shortly  I think  Legs open  Lip syncing  Twice  Well there you go Anthony  Everyone is talking about Ashley Simpson  Ah she sucks  Let's say hi to Dan in Ohio  Hey Dan  Hey how's it going guys?

[02:52:00]  Right  Oh from Pulp Fiction  Good song  This is Al Green  This guy  Okay  Yeah baby  Al Green revealed more of himself than ever  At the Apollo Thursday night  When he came on stage in a  Resplendent white tuxedo  I know  Resplendent  See that's the ongoing gag today though  Resplendent white tuxedo 
[02:52:30]  Resplendent  Why don't you just say he went on stage in a white tuxedo  Why does everyone have to get all  Because it was resplendent  Why does everyone have to get fancy  What does that word mean  I really don't know  Does anyone know  Resplendent  Yes  I don't know  It's to splendent again  It's probably  A little  Very  Very showy  Very  Glittery  Gaudy  Gaudy  Gaudy  Gaudy and flashy  Black  I'm black  So he walks out on the stage in this tuxedo  This tuxedo that is white 
[02:53:00]  Yeah  And a little bit on the flashy side  Flashy  With his fly open  Oops  Wow  Compounding the problem  The soul singer very apparently wasn't wearing underwear  He's got his big mule out as he's singing  Let's stay together  That's hilarious  That's awesome  God I love this guy  When audience members began to catch on and point toward the stage  One of his side musicians pulled Green aside and whispered in his ear 
[02:53:30]  A witness said  The reverend gave a little shimmy  And promptly zipped  Before going on to sing a rather incoherent version of  Let's stay together  Excuse me while I whip this out  Man  But then he went to sing and the wrong song started playing  So at the end of the show he just blamed his dick  I think his dick has more talent than Ashley Sims 
[02:54:00]  He started singing into it  That giant mule  And he did a little jig  What? That's what she said she did?  Oh of course that's what she said  Oh that's hilarious  Very good  And of course they probably went crazy at the Apollo  Oh yeah  Woo!  Oh cha!  Woo!  Cha!  The sandman come out and sweep it off the floor  Did he rub it on the log before he performed?  He knocked the log over with us 
[02:54:30]  It was the log  Hey you guys we got an update from Buffalo  Remember Mike?  I sure do  Mike, Anthony really fast  Cause we got new listeners that tuned in their  Tuned on  Turned on  Some satellite radios over the weekend  Yeah  Mike from Buffalo  Was pathetic guy  He had called us up  Wanting some advice on how he could maybe get a girl  He was in love with some girl  That he'd been hanging out with  And become good friends with  And he wanted it to go a little further 
[02:55:00]  She just sees him as a friend  And it seems his upstairs roommate or something  The neighbor  Yeah neighbor  The Navy guy's banging the hell out of her  Yeah met this chick at a bar one night  Takes her home  On his Harley  On his Harley  And bangs her  Pathetic guy has the Cavalier  And he works in a grocery store  And he can't understand why the girl went with the Navy guy  That has the Harley  That has the Harley  And he's just you know  Always there for the girl  Sat by her hospital bed for two days 
[02:55:30]  While she recovered from some problem  I don't know what it was  But he's always there for her  We thought  As a friend  We think it was either a drug overdose  Or an abortion  And she's just sitting there  And he's there sitting there  Probably a drug induced abortion  Hopefully she's not a post-operative transsexual  Sat there while they did the  Folded in  Let's get an update from Mike in Buffalo  Yes Mike  Oh what a weekend  What a weekend  Oh yeah what happened  Well  After I talked to you guys that day  I'm hanging out  We got a little bar in our basement 
[02:56:00]  You know where we got our TV  And DVDs and all that stuff  Yeah  I'm hanging out down here  Feeling sorry for myself  And after he goes to work  She stays up at his place  And comes down here  And proceeds to ask me  You know what's wrong  How am I doing  And I'm like  You know how the hell  You think I'm doing  You know this sucks  She goes what sucks  I go that the girl I like  Is upstairs  Spends the night with my neighbor  And then comes down here  And asks me how's my day going  Confrontation nice  Yeah  And she's like  Oh  Oh  And then you know  An awkward couple minutes 
[02:56:30]  And then she goes back upstairs  And I'd say probably  Since Friday morning  She's probably called me  Ten times wanting to hang out  That's awful  Wanting to hang out  Here's what that was  That was  He played the sad sack role  Yeah  How you doing  And she probably didn't catch on  For like 40 minutes  And he kept kicking around  And he would like  Hold the razor  And spin it in his fingers  What's wrong  And then he went into that thing  Yeah  Yeah  Dude I'm sure you're a nice guy  But you gotta realize  This guy's entertaining her upstairs  With tales of being on the USS Cole  When it blew out  And you're sitting there going 
[02:57:00]  Do you believe that milk went up  She's gotta bang the military guy  Right  Yeah  Yeah  You're done  She's just being nice  She's being because you're her friend  Yeah  It's like she keeps  Flowning it in my face  So it sucks  Yeah  Leaving to go to work  And seeing her car parked outside  Oh so he banged her well  She came back for more  Oh yeah  She's staying in the night  And everything  Yeah  Dude  Wow  It's over  You know you did exactly  What we told you not to do  She's going to work  With jizz in her hair  Because she doesn't have time  To shower 
[02:57:30]  It's kind of hard to say  You know  To not see her  When she comes down  Where you hang out  And you know  Start talking to you  You know  It's hard to ignore  Ignore her  He played the sad sack  I know he did  We told you not to  God  How you doing  I'm alright  No I'm okay  I'm alright  I'm alright  You know  But seeing you  The girl I like  Upstairs with  Oh  And then she's like  Oh  I feel so bad  Because you're such a good friend  That way  Now  What should I do  I should call  And maybe spend a little more time  With my good friend 
[02:58:00]  She's like  This is what she thought  Oh shit  There goes my ride to the airport  Yeah  Alright let me call him  What are you doing  In between getting banged really well  I'll call him  That's what I'll do  Dude  And we're not even knocking you  A little bit maybe  You gotta stop with this chick  Let her go  I know it's hard  Because she's banging the stud upstairs  And you're downstairs  With an apron  Going  Putting little price stickers  On apples  I understand it's frustrating  And I know he can't do  The things you can do  Like by golly  If cheese goes bad  Who's gonna tell her 
[02:58:30]  Right  Not him  You know  Throughout this weekend  I was tempted to call up  The Jay Leno chick again  And I  You know  But after the way  The reason I'm not banging her anymore  You guys will find this funny  You know  We were getting together  And I figured  You know  I'll be a nice guy  You know  Hoping for something in return  And I figure I'll go down on it  Right  Yeah  So I'm going down there  Taking care of some business  And you know  That's one of the things  I can do  Business  He's like filing his taxes  Wait he's bragging though  That's one thing you could do well  You said  Oh yeah  Like that  I'm pro

You're twisting my neck off.  Hey, let's hear it for Karen.  And the dude.  Illinois, once again.  Sexiest state in America.  Defending their title.  Defending their title.  Against nobody.  Against nobody.  Against themselves.  A full rod.  We want somebody to try.  Huh?  What, Karen?  We want somebody to try.  So do we.  We can't help people.  Yeah, you're, uh, you're saving. 
[03:11:00]  We're challenging.  You're saving your A material for when someone challenges you, right?  You better believe that.  Oh, it's got to be some anal action.  Yeah.  All right, it's Karen and the dude from Illinois.  Sexiest state in America.  Oh, Illinois.  Thanks, guys.  You're welcome.  Have a good day.  Oh, we will.  Yes.  I'd say the same to her, but she already has.  Great.  You know.  All right.  I don't know.  Was she really having an orgasm, though, or her lips just moving?  I think that was a legitimate, nice orgasm. 
[03:11:30]  Okay.  Wasn't that nice?  It was awesome.  It sounded great.  Yeah, a lot of sloppy sounds.  Yeah, there were slopping sounds.  There was her moaning.  Let's, uh, let's do these, um, PSAs.  I'm pretty good myself.  Shut up, Mike.  Anyone that talks about sex and says, if I do say so myself, is an ass and they're incompetent  in bed.  They usually buy themselves.  Yes.  All right.  We got the Canadian, uh, PSAs, Anthony. 
[03:12:00]  Mm-hmm.  A bold and innovative television public awareness campaign about domestic violence will not  be shown on Calgary television stations due to an unfavorable ruling from the TVB.  Damn.  Uh, that's the Television Bureau of Canada.  The TVB denied the Homefront Society of Calgary approval to run the two public service announcements  because they were deemed too graphic according to their Telecaster guidelines.  Uh, the purpose of the PSAs is to shine a light on domestic abuse by putting domestic 
[03:12:30]  violence situations in public places where it would not be tolerated.  Yes.  Get it?  So they're not going to run these on, uh, TV after all, but we have them for you today.  We should set them up a little visually.  Yes.  Even though we don't have, which one are you playing first?  Well, we're going to go with the showstopper second.  So we'll go with the one that's.  So the first one's the boardroom.  Yeah.  And in the boardroom, a guy, uh, is, uh, giving a presentation.  He gives some of his facts of the presentation and one of the guys, uh, disputes one of his  facts and, uh, the girl at the table, uh, says, no, I believe that gentleman was correct with 
[03:13:00]  his facts.  And the guy that disputed the facts then has a problem with the girl.  Right.  And, uh, takes it out on her.  Right.  Yeah.  And at the end, he throws a stapler at her head and it's great.  She squeaks and he kicks her.  So basically, yeah.  He takes care of business as all men should in an office.  Basically, you wouldn't act like this in the workplace.  So why would you work?  Uh, why would you act like this at home?  At home.  Right.  So here it is.  The audio of the commercial.  Are we putting up the actual video up on, uh, opianthony.com? 
[03:13:30]  Uh, they are there actually.  They're there right now.  Opianthony.com and foundyourmusic.com.  Okay.  Search on PSA.  You'll find them.  All right.  Here we go.  Search.  Shouldn't it be right there?  Ready to go?  I will make it blatantly obvious.  Ah, thank you.  And can I say for those of you about to watch this, get your mules out.  All right.  Here we go.  If you look at the next slide, you can see now that our operating costs are up 23%.  Ron, I think it's 19.  No, the new number's all right.  It is 23%. 
[03:14:00]  You stupid bitch.  Don't you ever correct me and hurt me well again.  What do you think you are, you ignorant cow?  You think you've got the right to tell me anything?  You wouldn't get away with it here.  You shouldn't get away with it at home.  Oh, my goodness.  He threw a stapler at her head.  It's classic.  He called her an ignorant cow.  Yeah.  You ignorant cow.  It really is graphic, too. 
[03:14:30]  The violence, the way it's done, it doesn't look fake.  It's great.  And just, not little slaps, punches to the face.  Just punches.  She was a little Budinsky anyway.  Keep your mouth shut.  Yes, I do believe those numbers.  Dude, the guy said...  Ah, she's brown-nosing the ball.  Oh, yeah.  Blasted that little tattletale skull with a stapler.  Straightened her right out.  You know what she got?  Exactly what she was asking for.  I'd say so, too.  All right.  You want to set up the second one, Anthony? 
[03:15:00]  The second one is a father.  Is that a restaurant?  A little table with his daughter and son.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yes, yes.  I'm sorry, because it is long distance.  Mike, the pussy's back.  What?  He wants to defend himself about his eating skills.  You know, he's not going to be able to do it.  Only a girl that he's been with can do that.  Right.  Mike, can we get the number of the girl that you were with?  Jay Leno?  Hello?  Mike?  What's up?  Can we get the number of the girl that you ate out?  Oh, that might be rough.  Why?  You can't get Jay Leno's number? 
[03:15:30]  I could, but I really don't want to have to have contact with her anymore.  Well, please, do it for us and do it for yourself.  Well, here's what I can defend myself with.  Okay.  You know, I've been given a bunch of good comments.  Mike, Mike, Mike.  Wait, no, wait.  Hold on, Mike, Mike, Mike.  You've never gone down on a girl before.  Yes, I have.  You'd probably kiss it like you'd kiss your grandmother's cheek.  Like, he probably doesn't even lick.  He probably just...  All right, you want to defend yourself. 
[03:16:00]  How are you going to defend yourself?  Anyway.  Go ahead.  Well, you know, I've been given many comments.  You know, everything from you exasperate me to, you know, you do it better than a girl  that's done it.  But the kicker, which, you know, is why I had to call back.  Exasperate.  I left this part out, but I did bang one of the girl upstairs' friends.  And Jim will love this.  Happened to have a heart transplant, and I banged her like a couple months after she got it.  So, you know, my friends all said...  This guy is the worst.  You had to bang a chick with a two-foot scar on her chest, you awful man. 
[03:16:30]  You are the worst.  You are the worst.  That's the only type of girl you can get.  So, you bang a chick that looks like Leno and a chick with a big scar in the middle of  her chest.  You are horrendous.  Anyways, the girl who I was after actually told me that her friend told her that I was  really good at that.  Like, it was a free commercial.  Of course she did, because she didn't want your sand-sack eyes falling on her bosoms  anymore.  So, she probably figured, yeah, she said you're really good, which meant, hey, keep banging  old scar chest.  She was happy she finally found someone dumb enough to bang Frankentits, and you jumped 
[03:17:00]  right in.  That chick in her weak new baboon heart.  How does that feel?  This guy is the worst.  She has a balloon in her heart, and she's...  That's funny.  How was it going down on old angioplast?  How was that?  It was actually some 15-year-old kid from Massachusetts that gave up the heart for her, so that's all  she knows.  Old Dick Cheney he's sleeping with.  Wow.  He's sleeping with Jay Leno and Dick Cheney. 
[03:17:30]  That's great.  That's nice.  So, she had the heart transplant how long ago?  Before you banged her?  Before I banged her.  What?  Three months before I banged her.  She was still having to go in for, you know, biopsies and stuff, like, once a week.  So, why did you decide to bang her?  I was really, really drunk.  Because it was the friend of the girl that he wants to be with.  And she said you were very good?  Oh, yeah.  She didn't tell me that.  She told the girl I wanted that, and then that girl told me.  Dude, do you not understand what happened there? 
[03:18:00]  Oh, boy.  The hot one who was banging the Navy guy wanted to get her friend laid, and her friend obviously  has that big stitch thing in the middle of her chest, so no guy in his right mind will  acknowledge she's alive.  And there you go with your little apple pricer, and you're ready to hop right in and give it  to her.  That's why her friend complimented you.  Yeah.  Huh.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Oh, God.  I would have respected that story.  Here's what would have made that story good. 
[03:18:30]  If you said she just got a brand new heart, and while I was having sex with her, it failed,  and she died, and I finished anyway.  That's how that call should have went.  It would be their hero if she died within 24 hours of me banging her.  Absolutely.  Her and her rotten little ape heart.  Oddball wants in on this from Ohio.  Oddball.  Yeah.  Mike.  Yeah.  Buy a Harley and join the fucking Navy.  That seems pretty easy, doesn't it?  That's all you have to do.  If that don't work, get a little bit of a slugger and do like the truck drivers do. 
[03:19:00]  Knock her over the fucking head in a pickle park.  If I want to join the Navy, all I got to do is go upstairs and knock on the door upstairs  because their job is a recruiter.  Is it really?  Yeah.  He's doing some recruiting.  He's recruiting.  He's recruiting.  All right.  He's a recruiter.  That's right.  He's recruited her vagina to be a missile storage silo.  He's a paid bullshitter.  The government is out of this kind of bullshit, people.  He's bullshitting her vagina.  There's plenty of semen in her vagina right now. 
[03:19:30]  Jesus.  All right.  You want to be in the Navy?  Thank you, Oddball.  You're good.  Bye, Oddball.  We like the Oddball.  Mike, we're done with you today.  I mean, it just gets worse and worse.  I just have to defend myself here.  Oh, you did a great job.  Yeah.  I had sex with a girl whose heart was just replaced.  And she said I was good.  She's grateful to be alive.  Really, a stiff breeze feels good.  While you were going down, she was just going good.  Air is good.  Breathing is good.  Life is good.  Sunshine is good.  No matter what you were doing, she was just happy that she could see something. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, there goes Mike.  Okay.  Her awful heart, weak walls.  So we have...  Hey, I know a chick with an ulcer that needs a good teabagging if you're not busy this weekend.  You creep.  Hangs outside the cancer ward and picks up chicks.  I banged her so hard, her wig was crooked.  Wow.  You're really a tiger, aren't you, fella?  Oh, I banged her so she puked while they were giving her chemo.  You told the girl I really want that I was really good. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, how about that?  Oh, that's just absolutely awful.  Oh, that's classic.  Where were we?  I don't know.  I totally forget.  Oh, the PSA is from Canada.  The second one.  Yeah.  Mike, please call in when you get down to Florida and you're fingering someone who's  having a hip replacement.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah, the second one.  The second spousal abuse PSA that Canada will not run after all.  Yeah.  After all.  Calgary, actually. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, it's a father is with two kids, a boy and a girl, little boy and little girl.  They're having dinner out at a restaurant.  And this waitress comes over and she's pouring coffee into the guy's coffee cup.  And she accidentally, accidentally spills some coffee out of the side of the cup.  And the guy gets a little agitated over this.  Yeah.  And works her over.  During the loud screaming, what he is doing, he had grabbed the coffee pot from her and  is now pouring scalding hot coffee on her chest as he pinned her to the table, only 
[03:21:30]  to be followed up by blows to the face.  It really is something.  Yeah, then he starts choking her.  And this video will be up later today on opianathony.com.  It's in the system somewhere, but you got to kind of like search it out, but we'll make  it very easy later on, okay?  Yeah, the video is really good.  Here's the audio of the PSA.  She spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry, sir.  You fucking bitch.  How do you like that? 
[03:22:00]  You wouldn't get away with it here.  You shouldn't get away with it at home.  Yeah.  Come on.  How could you not laugh at that?  I'm sorry.  It's so shocking to look at that you can't help but laugh because it's, you know, it's  not real.  So you watch it and just, oh my God, this guy is pounding this woman. 
[03:22:30]  It's so wrong.  It passes the point of being like, oh my God, that's so wrong.  That it becomes funny.  You know, things that are so absolutely wrong, but since it's not real footage of someone  getting beaten, it becomes funny and you laugh at it.  I got to say, though, you know, everybody is leaving out the fact that this man went to  a restaurant to have a nice meal and he was burned by somebody's clumsy.  No, she didn't burn him.  She just spilled his coffee out of the cup.  Well, you know what?  He didn't go to the restaurant to have his coffee spilled. 
[03:23:00]  He went to have a nice meal with his kids.  With his kids.  And have his coffee poured in the cup.  I feel bad that that waitress made it a situation that the kids then had to see something  so bad.  Absolutely.  You know?  It's his fault.  They should fire her.  It's his fault that she's bad at her job?  Little coffee spiller?  But let me tell you something.  This might sound cruel, but I'll bet the next guy that came in had his coffee poured right  to the rim.  I'll bet it didn't spill out of drop being spilled.  Right to the tippy top.  Right to the tippity top.  Yes. 
[03:23:30]  All right.  This guy is...  Well, let's see what's going on with Tom.  Hey, Tom.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Good.  Hi, Tom.  Good.  I've got my wife over here.  She's giving me some head.  I want a challenge for the sexiest state.  Oh, really?  But that means we've got to hear you.  Well, no.  We can move the phone.  I've got to explain.  This is kind of a guy show, so the whole sexiest state in America, I think you need...  I want to make our state the sexiest state.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, Billy.  Bend over.  Can she say hi?  Hold on a second.  Yeah. 
[03:24:00]  Hi.  No, we want to hear you with your mouth full.  That's what makes us funny.  We've got to explain funny to people.  No, you had to make sure that it wasn't alone.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on, dude.  One.  Just one.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't like the fact that she's making the yummy noise like young Frankenstein.  Oh. 
[03:24:30]  You went.  Oh.  Come on.  Make her gag once.  Yeah.  Just push that thing right in there.  Come on.  Pour hot coffee on her chest.  That's right.  Is she on the rotisserie? 
[03:25:00]  Is she moving that thing at all?  I don't know.  How great would it be just to hear a stapler bounce off that skull?  Plunk.  You spilled my coffee.  I left the, he's so incredulous.  She spilled my coffee.  Then he just does the next logical thing, which is a salt around the table with his fists.  He kind of chuckled when he said, she spilled like a fucking bitch.  Like, what's a gentleman to do? 
[03:25:30]  Right.  But savagely beat her.  I've got to work you over and scald your tits.  Oh.  Oh, back to this.  I can't wait until Mike calls.  I just had sex with this waitress.  She had scars all over her tits from hot coffee being spilled on them.  You buffalo zilch.  It still works.  You really stink.  Stupid northern New York goose egg.  I got a BJ from a girl with a larynx cancer. 
[03:26:00]  She said, I was great.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Oh.  I shot a load.  It dribbled down her chest.  And I did it in her mouth.  I ate the ass of the pitcher whose sock was bleeding.  Mike really is a creep.  I didn't know if it was a tampon or Curt Schilling's sock.  So I investigated.  Jesus.  Get a hold of yourself.  I pulled out his Achilles sheath. 
[03:26:30]  He said it was great.  Oh.  Oh?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It's times like these I start thinking who I gave XM satellite radios to.  Oh, I know.  I know.  I have to shit mine to my parents.  I went to a christening over the weekend.  And I saw my mother.  I hate christenings.  The kid doesn't even know you're there.  Yeah, the kid doesn't know you're there.  Doesn't have a clue yet.  And my mother was like, yeah, I, she goes, there are times I just have to turn the radio 
[03:27:00]  off.  I'm like, oh, you're out of the demo.  She goes, well, there was, you know, the thing with the, I don't think she enjoyed the  drill dose segment very much.  Oh, wow.  That really, yeah, I know.  Go figure.  You don't want your mom to call and go, that drill dose section was hilarious.  It was really hot.  Or hot.  Yeah.  How was the christening?  Did they ask you if you renounce Satan and all his works?  You know something?  We're in the church and he went through that whole spiel.  Do you renounce Satan and all his work?  And I'm like, I love this scene.  I do renounce them.  Right when that shotgun comes out of the box and bam. 
[03:27:30]  Mo Green gets one right in the eye and 30 seconds later puts his head down.  This girl's working.  You goddamn guineas really make me laugh.  I know.  I cut her chest open and put a new heart in.  You put a new heart in her chest because that loser from Buffalo is going to go down on  her.  We're talking business.  Please be killing her.  The man that's banging her was Mo Green. 
[03:28:00]  If I find a ventricle on the table, I'll know I have a pot.  Senator, this committee owes Mike an apology. 
[03:28:30]  I'm going to say murder.  I'm sorry, guys.  She's not dead yet.  Wow.  Very nice.  What the hell are you doing to her?  I'm just playing with her.  I like it.  Wow.  Right on, Tom.  Nice.  They might have just taken the title.  What do you think?  No.  They were very good.  Very good.  They don't take the title, but they were very good.  Why?  It was very good, but I think Illinois is still in the lead.  What were you doing to her, Tom?  Well, she was going down on me.  I was playing with her with my fingers. 
[03:29:00]  I got you.  I prefer Illinois.  Not that Mike, this guy was great, too.  But I prefer the first one just because I like the quiet.  Where did she run off to?  Who, my wife?  Yeah.  She's right here.  Oh, it sounded like her voice was running away.  No, she was just moving down the end of the bed.  Hold on.  Here she is.  All right.  Hello?  Hey.  Hello.  Hi.  So, anyway, Marge, what I was saying.  Oh, my name isn't Marge.  No, I know, but it was like you went.  Why do I have to explain this?  You little guinea brat. 
[03:29:30]  Clean it up.  Go on.  Be a murderer, just like your father.  Hey, go show Carl on a tree.  All right.  So, that was good.  Thank you.  Yeah, that was very good.  Very nice.  We liked that.  I would definitely say New York is second.  Okay.  Okay.  But I kind of liked the, I like that, that just the shot in the mouth.  I thought the listeners were going to decide this.  Oh, they are.  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's take a look.  I worked in the dairy department with his father. 
[03:30:00]  All right.  Well, you guys did great today.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Hi, in the Sierra Mountains drinking jizz.  There they go.  The PSAs are now up on opiananthony.com.  Ah, there you go.  Yes, Jim, the trucker.  Breaker to Jim.  Hello.  Hey, Jim, what's up?  Jim.  I was just listening to the...  I was just listening to this guy. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  What's going on, Jim?  Jim?  All right.  Okay, that was good.  I don't know what...  Hello?  Yeah, Jim, go ahead.  What's going on?  Your show is fantastic.  I think he's listening to the radio.  Oh, yeah, don't listen to the radio.  There's a slight delay.  Son of a bitch, Jim.  What?  I just heard it come out of his ass.  Son of a bitch.  He just farted.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Tell Sonny to hold on to that notorious colon of his.  We're done with Jim.  Can we take a break?  We've got to regroup, obviously. 
[03:31:00]  Jim farted on the causeway.  Okay.  Oh, classic.  All right, we'll take a break.  All righty.  And we'll regroup.  And did we do anything today?  I think it was a very educational program.  Eric Logan was giving me a speech that we need more current events on the show.  And more guests.  More current events and guests.  Opie.  Yes?  I realized that Mr. Logan, as I like to call him because it keeps him in that boss-type  area, I realized he came over to a shindig at your place. 
[03:31:30]  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  But the last thing we ever want to do is to listen to anyone in upper management.  No matter how friendly they seem, no matter how nice they are, it is bad practice for this  program to listen to any suggestions from the brass.  But I got a great current events story that we almost forgot about.  Well, I'm not saying we shouldn't do some current events and stuff, but if it comes from the  boss, take it with a grain of salt.  Good point.  What are we, a zoo crew? 
[03:32:00]  Should we have the celebrity news segment?  Because if you use one of their ideas, then they start piling new ones on.  Before you know it, you're a puppet for management.  All right.  That's right.  Like some Pesanavante.  We do have a Tony Danza review, too.  We got a lot of stuff to still do.  Angela.  Okay.  Yeah, there's that story about the three women that went in the Passaic River.  Well, want to talk about next?  And for some reason, all drowned. 
[03:32:30]  Couldn't figure out how to unlock their door.  Open the friggin' door.  All right.  We'll do this, we'll do that, and a little bit of that as well.  All right.  All right.  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony.  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children.  So turn them off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:33:00]  I had an uncle that went crazy.  Crazy, man.  Everybody's got a crazy uncle.  He's usually your favorite uncle when you're a kid, too.  You don't realize he's crazy until you're about 15.  No wonder Bobby was so much fun.  He's out of his fucking mind.  My uncle Bobby lost his mind.  You know what people do when they lose their mind?  They start repeating shit that don't mean nothing.  Every time you ask Bobby a question, you answer it the same way. 
[03:33:30]  Bobby, what time is it?  If you want to feel funky, feel free.  And please don't spread that funk on me.  What did that mean?  I'll never know.  You know what cartoon I used to hate when I was a kid?  Fat Albert and the Cotsbury kids.  It's like the most racist, racist, most degrading cartoon in the history of television. 
[03:34:00]  I actually had a guy walking around with a damn hat pulled over his head.  And another guy going,  Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm illiterate.  Egg rinse. 
[03:34:30]  Hi, my name is Debbie Ellis.  Can I help you?  Yes, I'm looking to fill a permanent position.  Certainly.  Now, what kind of position are you looking to fill?  I'm looking to fill doggy style is the position.  What is that?  Doggy style.  I beg your pardon?  Doggy style.  Which means?  Which means, you know, in the rear.

[03:36:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  Get now, get down with the sickness.  Get now, get down with the sickness.  Get now, get down with the sickness.  And the sickness is called O&A.  Oh, stop it.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out today. 
[03:37:00]  If you like what you're hearing, tell a friend,  because Lord knows we could use the help around here, right?  Absolutely.  Anthony, is this a sucks-to-be-you story?  Story, is this a...  Absolutely sucks-to-be-you story.  A sucks-to-be-you story, okay?  This is a sucks-to-be-you.  And a little bit of, you know...  Who am I?  I don't know the details.  Oh, just what I read in the paper, Opie.  But, um...  This seems a little avoidable.  I don't know, man.  Three drowned in SUV horror plunge. 
[03:37:30]  Horror plunge.  A Jeep Cherokee with three, uh...  Three ladies driving home from a party.  At 4.30 a.m.  Ran off the road and into the Passaic River in Newark.  And, uh...  There they are.  In the Passaic River.  Now, the thing doesn't sink immediately.  Cars don't just go right down the, uh...  And sink. 
[03:38:00]  So as it's kind of floating for a little bit,  uh...  They pull out the cell phone and make the call.  Let's say you drive off the road.  And, uh...  You go into a river.  You pull out your cell phone.  Who do you call, Opie?  Who do you call?  Ghostbusters, Anthony?  Not the Ghostbusters.  Triple A?  Uh, no.  If it was Earl, I'm sure he'd call Opie.  Hey, you got any change?  Hey, what's up?  Ben would be calling everybody. 
[03:38:30]  Opie, I don't think I'm going to be making my free dinner tonight.  No.  Um, could you tell any W I won't be in tomorrow?  As producer of the, uh...  Joe Cozzi.  Joe Cozzi show?  Oh, here's the video again.  Oh, oh.  Wham!  You dropped something.  It would have been nice if...  Stupid news graphic in the way.  The word, the WABC news thing is there,  so you can't see that pretty face smashing the eyes.  Jackasses.  Idiots, we know what channel it is.  All right.  Go ahead, Anthony. 
[03:39:00]  So they pull out the cell phone.  They pull out the cell phone and called a friend.  They called a friend...  Instead of 911.  ...and desperately screamed,  Help us, to a stranger outside the car.  Okay.  But they made a frantic call to a friend.  And were screaming, you know, help, we're in the water.  Help me, help me, help me.  Help me, help me.  Yeah, I don't know where any of my sounds are.  I know.  That's why I'm going to just start doing them for you.  I also have another one that I wanted to play. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  For these...  No?  That one?  No.  But...  Open the door!  See, I'm...  How about opening the door?  I'm going to challenge you a little bit.  You're going to challenge me on this one?  Challenge.  They're already in the water.  You can't just open the door.  There's a way you can open the door when your vehicle is sinking.  And how is that?  First of all, you do it immediately.  Immediately. 
[03:40:00]  You open the door and prop your foot against it and push as hard as you can.  As water starts coming in to the bottom, the pressure will equalize.  And you can then open the door.  I don't know if they could do it, though, because I think they had electric locks, like  a lot of these stupid cars.  So when they hit the water, it may have shorted it.  I mean, I'm just guessing.  And maybe they couldn't open the door.  I mean, I'm sure that was an option they tried.  There's regular locks, even on electric locks.  There's still a lock that you can manually lock and unlock.  To make it thief-proof now, you can't get your fingers around it because it's just like 
[03:40:30]  that little piece of metal sticking out.  Some of them go right down to the...  Opie, what are the locks like?  I don't think I have a regular lock on my car.  No?  Just when you said that, I'm thinking, I think I just got the electronic locks.  That's all I have.  In my stylus.  Because I've thought about this stuff, man.  There's too much electronics going on with the cars.  And it's like, if you get in a situation like this and it shorts out, what do you do?  Usually, if your door is locked from the inside, you can open the door from the inside.  How would you break the window?  You're not pulling a bolt when you hit that button.  You're not manually pulling a bolt when you hit that button. 
[03:41:00]  You are releasing the electronics to release the lock.  So if there's no electronics working in the car...  But can't you open it from the inside, regardless of if it's locked or not?  Well, you know what?  I think when you open, it's a safety thing.  Not all cars have that.  There's theft protection that allows you not to do it.  What I'm saying is, I would get the hell out of this vehicle.  You're damn right I'd get out of here.  There's three women calling friends.  Leave it to these broads.  Calling friends up. 
[03:41:30]  Hello.  And the ones yelling, look, I don't have that many weekend minutes left.  Yeah.  Can I make a call?  No.  I ain't using my phone.  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  So a stranger who was looking from his apartment sees this car go into the river.  He has time to grab his cell phone, run downstairs, run across with a flashlight to find the car,  and he sees it in the Passaic River, not sunk yet. 
[03:42:00]  But he was too busy wondering if the chick he likes is being banged by the Navy guy.  No, I don't think it was Mike.  Oh.  Yeah, it could have been Mike out looking to score.  Yeah.  He ran into the river with a price gun.  Here's an easy target for me.  Jesus.  This guy jumps up on the hood.  Yeah.  And he said the back of the car now starts sinking.  I guess the water started getting in the rear, and it starts tipping up and sinking. 
[03:42:30]  So he goes to the side window, and he's trying to break it with his elbow as they're inside.  God, now what kind of nightmare is this that's going to stick with him for the rest of his life?  He's trying to break it with his elbow, and they're just screaming,  help us, help us, get us out, as he watches the vehicle slip beneath the murky waters of the Passaic.  I just believe it's called glug, glug, glug.  Glug, glug.  There it goes.  Slipping beneath the depths of the Passaic River.  They weren't survivors.  They were not survivors. 
[03:43:00]  Jack, hold on, Jack.  Jack was holding on.  He was on the hood.  Yeah, he was on the hood.  That was the most he was going to do for these people.  And, boy, he's got to live with that whole thing.  Like, why didn't he break the window from the apartment if he grabbed the flashlight?  Didn't he have a flashlight?  Break it with a flashlight?  I don't know.  It just seems like there should have been.  Those windows seem pretty sturdy, too, because I've thought about that as well.  I'm like, how would I break a side window if I was in a weird situation like that?  I think about that stuff. 
[03:43:30]  You're supposed to use something very sharp and pointy.  But, you know, what do you have in there?  Nothing.  I don't have anything.  I'm not a gang banger.  Well, they sell things.  They sell things.  It's a dude from Long Island.  It's a very small hammer.  They sell something.  It's a small hammer with a spike on one end.  And then the other end is a razor blade so you can cut your seatbelt.  And you're supposed to keep that somewhere in your vehicle.  That's a good idea.  It is a good idea, but you assume it's never going to happen so you don't need it.  You'd probably be reaching for it.  It'll be under the seat.  Yeah, of course.  You'd leave it in the back.  Are you ready for your...  You're all trapped in your seatbelt. 
[03:44:00]  You ready for your science lesson today, Anthony?  Science!  Douglas from Florida.  Yeah.  He's going to blind us with science.  Yes.  Okay.  No, I'm not going to blind you with science.  I did firefighting nine and a half years.  Okay.  And down in Texas, we did swift water rescue.  You cannot open up the door if it's getting submerged.  Because the force of the water would...  That's what I'm saying.  I think you need to get that window down, you know, before it starts...  Once the pressure...  Look, if they drown in there, that means the cab filled up with water. 
[03:44:30]  Once it gets to a certain point, you can open the door.  The pressure's equalized.  Look, let's be honest.  They were effed either way because...  They're panicking.  They're not thinking.  Look at their pictures.  They can't swim.  There is a tool that we use in rescue to break windows on vehicles.  It's called a hole punch.  Yeah.  It's a little spike with a spring load in it.  Right.  You put it up against the window and you push on it really hard. 
[03:45:00]  It causes that spike to go in and then the spring will automatically eject out, causing  the window to break.  Yeah, that's a handy little device.  But what about...  What could they have done while they were drowning?  I mean, it's kind of hard to celebrate, all right, just once the thing fills up, open  your doors.  You're supposed to do that.  Not panic.  Wait till it fills up and open the door.  Like you're saying, you do not panic.  I would.  Of course you would.  But the thing is, the average person would panic.  Not only trained professionals would be able to do that.  The thing is, get that window down before it starts filling up. 
[03:45:30]  That way you can crawl out the window.  Right.  But why couldn't they get the window down?  Do you think would the electrical stuff shut off as soon as they hit the water?  Yeah, it would short out.  Electricity and water does not mix.  It might.  It's not...  It doesn't always, especially with 12 volts.  They have to put some kind of a safety thing where you could manually get the windows down.  That's why I didn't want electric windows for years.  Look at you.  I swear to God, for years, dude.  For years, the only reason I got electric windows is because when it rains and you're  looking for hookers, you have to lean over and manually roll down the window so you 
[03:46:00]  could see how the pass to your side was awful.  It's true.  All right.  Well, are you done, Douglas?  Yeah, that's about it, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Joe in Brooklyn wants to add to this.  Hey, Joe.  How's it going, guys?  Good.  Listen, do you think when this guy went to save the woman and he jumped on the hood of  the car, do you think his weight made the car sink?  No, because the...  Oh, that would be bad.  Yeah.  It was like precariously in the balance and he just jumped on it.  Oh, and he reamed it.  No, I'm sure he...  I'm sure he did his best. 
[03:46:30]  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Take it easy.  Well, that's definitely a tragedy today.  Scuba unit from nearby Wallington was finally called in at 514, nearly an hour after the  accident.  Yee.  Well, you know.  But didn't they say that the only way those guys thought that they would have survived  is the dive team would have had to have been right there like...  Yeah, there's no way.  It doesn't matter.  An hour or three minutes.  You know, it doesn't matter.  What I'm saying is maybe they should have called 911 first. 
[03:47:00]  That's terrible.  Because, you know, if you get a cop in there, you might have some gear where he could...  Break the window.  Break the window if he's right around the corner.  You never know.  Well, they didn't know exactly where they were, I think.  The girls didn't know exactly where they were.  They just did there and there.  We made a left at a light and hit a...  You know.  Ah, that's why you need the OnStar.  Hello, OnStar?  Yes, I just drove into the water.  Can you help me?  Yes, we're inflating the inflatable raft that is around every GM vehicle.  This really turned into a buzzkill.  Yeah.  Did it?  Yeah, we had a fun show going and... 
[03:47:30]  I'll fix it.  Yeah.  There we go.  Oh, stop.  No, it kind of makes you think, like, ooh, that's kind of creepy.  That's something I do think about a lot.  Galug.  When you go over some of these bridges and stuff, you wonder how would you get out.  You really do, man.  Crack the window a little bit, man, because you could always...  If the window's cracked and you're going to drown, you could put your hands where the opening of the window is and pull it and break it.  Yeah, you could.  I could.  There's no way.  Maybe if I had a big man in the car with me.  Those things are pretty strong. 
[03:48:00]  No, but if the window's already halfway down or a quarter of the way down, you could punch your way through that.  You could kick that out.  Wow, look.  No one's calling us anymore.  This really was a great showstopper.  Oh, no.  I think if you...  Right when you hit the water, I think you could still roll that goddamn window down.  I don't know.  But most people aren't thinking that.  That's the thing.  You've got to think that.  You've got to be ready to move.  Well, you know what it was?  When they were in the water, one of them leaned up and went, don't you say a fucking word.  The driver said, I'm just trying to drive you to the stall. 
[03:48:30]  Well, you know what it was?  They said her foot got stuck because somebody had spray-cainted...  Spray-cainted?  Oh, God.  Did you say spray-cainted?  Oh, the humanity.  What is a spray-cainted?  Please, someone break the window so Jim can get out.  He's going down.  He wants to get out of this bit.  Yeah, I was going to say spray-cainted some glue to the gas pedal, and they jumped the 
[03:49:00]  thing into the embankment.  He's still trying.  I'm just explaining where I was going.  He is really trying.  I just thought there was something there.  You know where you went?  Right into the drink.  I really did.  Sorry to hear that the good old boys...  All right, let's go back to the phone.  So there's your tragedy for today, I guess.  I don't know.  Steve the Trucker, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, I just wanted to say one thing right off the bat.  Oh, he went into the water.  Yes, what's that?  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm just real glad that you guys are back on so I can hear and listen to you again. 
[03:49:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Now, on your subject about the car, I got a sneaking feeling that when they hit the  river, it scared the piss out of them so bad, the car filled up before they could roll  the window down.  Maybe they panicked, yeah.  Oh, that was a piss show.  Okay.  No, I think they emptied their bladders in the car, and that filled it up.  There you go.  Thank you, Steve.  We got to say how to Colt 45.  Hey, Colt.  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  All right.  What do you got, Mr. 45?  Hey, I just said, thank you, man. 
[03:50:00]  That's the funniest fucking thing I've heard all day, man.  Those stupid fat whores driving the fucking river.  That's a little inappropriate.  No, it's not, man.  If you're too stupid to roll down a fucking window, open the door, it's thin in the herd.  Kill them all.  Fucking dumb cunt.  You know, he just knows this.  Wow.  Wow.  The C word made it.  What did they do to you?  This appearance back on our show.  I got it.  Even I got to bail out on that one.  Dude, that's a little rough.  You do see some of these stories in the paper, and you do think maybe it is kind of a thinning 
[03:50:30]  the herd type of thing, but I don't know.  That's not.  This one wasn't.  It was 4.30 in the morning, too.  It was dark.  I mean, the panic, man.  What do you do?  Yeah.  Three of them, though.  You think one.  Maybe one of them would have one ounce of, you know.  Something.  Self-preservation.  Hey, look.  Instead of calling Domino's and canceling the order, could you roll the window down?  I guess they'll have to do tests on the vehicle to see if it was some kind of problem.  That's what you don't want to hear.  Then there's going to be a recall because of this. 
[03:51:00]  Guys, I'm trying, but I can't find anything.  And Opie will have to turn in his vehicle.  I am so trying to find something.  We're dying here a little bit.  No.  No, not.  The three of us are drowning?  See, you're the one that just goes right down with it.  What happened?  You got to open a window.  That's right.  Ant and I are kicking at the windows, and you're just sitting there on the phone hoping  help shows up.  All right.  Let's go to the phones and say hi.  Sure.  There's phone calls.  What did we learn?  All right.  Let's try that.  There you go, Opie.  Sure.  Why not? 
[03:51:30]  Bill from Connecticut.  Hey.  Hey.  I learned that if you fill a Jeep with water, the engine floats.  Oh, right.  He said the rear end went down first.  The engine up.  There you go.  Great stuff.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Rob.  Well, the worst part about this one was that one friend that survived went out and said  that the other two were kidnapped by a black carjacker.  Oh, God.  Let's go to Rob.  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Okay.  I learned that somewhere in Opie's apartment right now, there's a rat going on a napkin.  Nice.  There is. 
[03:52:00]  Opie's rat.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Craig in New Jersey.  Hey, Craig.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up?  I learned that Norton sucks at trying to give our Blues Brothers references.  I really did trip on that one like an idiot.  Stumblebum.  I'm sorry, mister.  At least you got it, though.  All right.  Let's say, let's see.  It's Jay from Illinois.  Today, I learned that the Canadian PSAs are the greatest thing I've ever seen, and Mike  is a bigger loser than previously indicated.  Yeah.  Munaki, check it in.  New Jersey.  It's Pat.  Was Susan Smith standing on the bank? 
[03:52:30]  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Chris from Boston.  I learned today.  Hey, gents.  Today, I learned retards have the worst comebacks, and Opie is a multimillionaire with an aversion  of buying snacks.  Eric from Jersey.  I learned today that it's perfectly acceptable in Canada to assault a waitress for spilling  a little coffee in your lap.  Well, it should be.  Donkey Sausage checking in from Radio Shack.  Donkey Sausage.  I learned that if Opie invites you to a party, it's BYO booze, food, table, and chair. 
[03:53:00]  Pull up to Opie's house, bring a chair, little table.  George from Connecticut.  Hey, George.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  Hi.  Nice to be back on.  Hey, listen.  That first phone call should have been out to Teddy Kennedy.  He could have gotten him out.  Yeah, he could have gotten out and swam home.  How is he still in office?  Left her there to drown.  Just amazes me.  He had to go away.  Waited six hours and got some help.  Yeah.  And these Massachusetts idiots still vote for him every year.  Year after year after year.  Keep him in there. 
[03:53:30]  That's right.  They forgave him.  It's amazing.  That is one of the most amazing stories ever.  Didn't even say anything was wrong for hours.  No.  No, he went home and took a nap.  I'm tired.  And what was his excuse?  That he panicked, I think.  Wasn't that the official excuse?  That he panicked?  Didn't know what to do?  Come on.  There's so much to that story.  So much to that story.  Carmen.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  I just want to let you guys know.  OMA is penetrating the Zion Curtain, my friends. 
[03:54:00]  We're in Utah.  The Zion Curtain.  Oh, wow.  We're in Utah.  Cool.  We're in Utah, and I passed the virus to a few friends, too, so it's fucking awesome.  So, thank you.  All right.  Watch it out.  Thank you.  Tom says that he learned DS is the sequel to AI.  Oh, very good.  Sorry, Jude Law.  I didn't even know that.  Brandon from Buffalo.  Idiot.  I couldn't figure that out.  Yeah.  The AI.  The AI.  What's that stand for, Jim?  Darn silliness?  Darn silliness on AI. 
[03:54:30]  What?  That was really funny.  Brandon.  Yeah, I learned that thanks to Mike, we're no longer embarrassed of the Bills anymore.  Ah.  Oh, you're another Buffalo guy, right?  Mike is a bigger embarrassment than the Bills.  Okay.  And if them girls would have smiled and opened their eyes, maybe somebody would have saved  them.  Oh, it was dark.  Well, that's what he's saying.  I was just trying to help him along with his little joke.  No need to reiterate.  All right.  How about those Bills, huh? 
[03:55:00]  Oh, they're terrible.  There you go.  They stink.  Oh, I got season tickets, too.  What a waste.  What a waste.  Why can't I hang up on this guy?  I mean, thank you, Brandon.  The mouse was stuck again.  Jimmy.  I'm too good, sir.  It can't work.  There we go.  He's gone.  What the hell was that noise, though, beforehand?  Hopefully a shotgun blast.  That was a shotgun blast.  All right.  Cage from WhackBag.com.  I learned you could enjoy some butterscotch pudding for $250 from the escort menu on Craigslist. 
[03:55:30]  Kevin, I learned today Al Green looked, oh, you're going to make me say the word again.  Al Green looked resplendent in concert.  Yes.  Henchman from Brooklyn.  I learned Black Girl sounds the same at 6 a.m. as he does at noon.  Mike from Jersey.  I learned that when you go to Opie's, bring snacks.  Oh.  Two minutes.  Two minutes left?  Oh.  All right.  Hey, speaking of video games, Grand Theft Auto?  Oh, when's that coming out?  It comes out tomorrow, right?  What? 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, we're going to have someone on.  Tomorrow?  We're going to have Lars.  Uh, Lars.  Today?  Comes out today?  Oh, comes out tomorrow.  I could get it today?  Where?  No, they're mailing it to our...  I don't care.  I need it immediately.  They're mailing it to our houses.  You know how long the mail takes?  No, we were supposed to get an advance copy.  This isn't NEW anymore.  We get the mail there.  If this isn't at my house today, I will go out and buy it.  And then I'm going to have to give my free copy away.  Laszlo will be on the show tomorrow.  I cannot wait.  To talk about Grand Theft Auto.  Oh, you know what a new feature to Grand Theft Auto, the new one, San Andreas says? 
[03:56:30]  What?  If you stop your car at a light or somewhere, you're in danger of being jacked.  You know how you can usually just run out and throw the guy out of the vehicle?  A gang can come over and throw you out of the vehicle, work you over, and steal your car.  That's a cool new feature.  A little more of a threat.  And they're all just gangbangers.  There's these roving bands of black people and Hispanics and Asian gang members that  are just wreaking havoc on the city.  But supposedly, too, if you don't run around enough, you get fat in this game. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, you can get fat and then you won't get the respect.  Right.  Not only that, the area, the gaming area, five times the size of Ice City.  Yeah, it's going to be great.  Five times the size.  Country, city.  They have a Las Vegas area.  So I'm very psyched to start beating people's skulls in with baseball bats.  All right.  It's entertainment for the 21st century, Jim.  So this has nothing to do with you.  I'm just wondering if they have an SUV option where you drive into the drink.  Yes.  In the other game, you can do that, yes. 
[03:57:30]  And you were never able to get out of the vehicle there.  No, either.  So I guess that was very, very accurate.  The guy's elbowing the window like it's a good joke between he and the vehicle.  Hubba, hubba.  Done.  I think so.  This music is freaking me out.  Uh-oh.  Seven, six, five, four, three, two.  See you tomorrow.  Bye.  Oh.  How do you propose we get an entire nation to sit through a massive dick show?  The OPNM Show. 
[03:58:00]  From behind me, a...  Customer service.  May I help you?  Yes.  I need, um, the location for, uh, where I can ship a package.  Yeah, where are you calling from?  Knoxville, please.  What?  Knoxville.  Oh, yeah.  How much does it weigh?  I don't know.  That's why I need to take it somewhere.  You don't know how, how am I supposed to track your, how much it's going to cost?  You don't know how much it weighs. 
[03:58:30]  Uh, sir.  What's the matter with you?  Sir, um, I just wanted to know if there was a, uh, service center in Knoxville that I could go to.  Yeah, but I, I, I told you I need to know how much your package, well, I need to know the, the, the, the, the dimensions before I can tell you how much it's going to cost you.  I don't...  You people call it up.  I don't, I don't, I need that information.  Sir, how am I supposed to know how much...  If you would just shut up and let me explain to you, I need to know.  Excuse me? 
[03:59:00]  I need, but let me explain.  You just calm your ass down, young lady.  You work for ***, yes, sir?  Yeah, give me the dimensions of your package so I can hurry up and take another call.  I've been here since 8 o'clock this morning.  Sir, I cannot believe that you represent ***.  You better get another job.  We have words in the South they don't have in other parts of the country.  I mean, you come to the South, we have words like, yonk to. 
[03:59:30]  We go in the mall, yonk to.  What letter does that start with?  Does anybody know?  I like this word a lot.  All right.  That's a word in Texas.  All right.  Around lunchtime every day you'll hear somebody say,  Hey, gee, yet?  No, gee.  You want to?  All right.
