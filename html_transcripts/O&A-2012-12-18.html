<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often interweaving them in a chaotic yet characteristically entertaining manner.  The show opened with a heavy focus on the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton expressed outrage at the media's coverage, specifically criticizing CNN, Dr. Oz, and Dr. Phil for what they saw as exploitative and insensitive intrusion into the grieving families' privacy.  They discussed the inaccurate initial reporting of the shooter's name and criticized the lack of media accountability.  The conversation touched upon gun control, the potential for another assault weapons ban, and the gun culture in America, interspersed with Jim Norton's vulgar anal hygiene routine and a humorous montage of presidential addresses on school shootings.  The segment also referenced the movie "We Need to Talk About Kevin."

The show then shifted to a discussion of the ongoing feud with the Westboro Baptist Church.  The hosts detailed how Anonymous hacked Shirley Phelps-Roper's Twitter account to express sympathy for Sandy Hook victims, and they gleefully exploited the revelation of her son being born out of wedlock to mock the church's hypocrisy.  Jim Norton contributed particularly offensive tweets to this online attack.  The hosts debated whether the Westboro Baptist Church should be legally recognized as a hate group.  This segment also included a phone call with Joe Rogan.

Rogan's call initially focused on the future of human interaction and humor in a technologically advanced world, including speculation about mind-reading technology. The conversation quickly pivoted to a defense of Alex Jones, with Rogan arguing that despite his inaccuracies and conspiracy theories, Jones had accurately predicted or exposed government misconduct.  Rogan also discussed his new comedy special, his podcast (crediting Opie and Anthony as inspiration), Barack Obama's aging appearance, the ethics of drone warfare, a disastrous comedy show featuring Bill Burr, Dom Irrera, and Jimmy Shubert, the leaked nude photos of Scarlett Johansson and the hacker's subsequent prison sentence, Coney Island's plastic boardwalk, and nostalgic childhood cartoons.  A substantial portion of Rogan's segment was dedicated to crude and offensive anecdotes about E-Rock, including tales of his Christmas party antics, unusual snacking habits, and an incident involving live goldfish.  This section concluded with Christmas songs themed around E-Rock.

The show featured numerous listener-submitted songs about E-Rock, many crude and offensive, including a self-deprecating "I'm an Asshole" song.  The hosts also speculated about the sexual orientation of their staff.  A major portion of the broadcast detailed the firing of a staff member, Danny, due to his bringing a porn star as his plus-one to a One Direction concert. The hosts recounted the management's reaction and discussed other staff firings and their own involvement in these events.  A comedic year-in-review song, created by staff member Sam, was played, leading to further mocking of Sam for self-promotion. The show also included a call from Union, New Jersey police officers thanking the hosts for promoting their toy drive for Sandy victims, highlighting the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy in Seaside Heights.  Further discussion of the toy drive, E-Rock's family's post-Sandy situation, staff relationships, and Jimmy's upcoming comedy shows followed. Sam Roberts' brief after-show segment mentioned an incident from the previous day, concluding with the police officers returning to distribute promotional items.

A post-party segment featured Troy, Roland, and callers discussing a conflict between Troy and Joe DeRosa, seemingly stemming from a prior offense, highlighted by Roland's drunken attempt to set DeRosa on fire with a candle.  The conversation shifted to the party itself, mentioning Troy's two girlfriends (including Katie Storm, whose Twitter account had been previously targeted), Roland's popularity with women, and further sexually explicit comments.  The firing of Danny was again discussed, along with speculation about the reasons for his dismissal, attributing much of the blame to his attitude and conflicts with other staff members, particularly Mars.  A trailer for a short film documenting an argument between Danny and Mars was played.  The segment also featured discussions of past conflicts and tensions between Troy and Roland, culminating in an anecdote about Troy destroying Roland's office, alongside sexually suggestive comments about Nicole, and plans for an upcoming trip to Las Vegas.  The show concluded with plugs for upcoming events and merchandise.  Throughout the entire broadcast, offensive language and sexually explicit content were pervasive.  A bizarre, unrelated clip of a man being repeatedly kicked in the groin as part of a “Nutcracker Suite”-themed bit was also included.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  And this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot.  Do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started. 
[00:04:00]  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn to the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie the Destroyer.  I wouldn't eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  That doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony the Rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  I'm tired of these people.  Up my ass all the time trying to get me to help.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:05:00]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Hi.  Good morning.  Hi.  Just more of our Christmas gifts, Jim Norton.  What is this?  Bullets?  Rap.  Oh, yeah.  Someone sent us bullets today.  Well, it's not.  They're not live ammo.  He made a chess set out of bullets, but... 
[00:05:30]  For Christmas.  Nice, right?  Checkmate.  And some bootleg discs over there.  Oh, yeah.  A couple DVDs.  It's the thought that counts.  Again, Christmas present fail.  No, no.  It's the thought that counts.  Fuck the thought.  How about some good shit?  I hate them.  Wine.  I got some nice wine last week.  I know.  I got some nice silver oak. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you.  You won.  Cabernet.  Yes.  Someone knows what I like.  Cabernet.  Cabernet.  Cabernet.  Cabernet.  Cabernet.  Cabernet.  Cabernet.  Cabernet.  Silver oak.  Thank you.  Stunt parade just wrote.  Stunty.  Good old Stunty.  What's he got going on?  Well, Stunty writes...  From the blaze.  Please keep beating...  Please keep beating up CNN and other networks who are still live at Newtown funerals.  Hashtag bloodsuckers.  There's no fucking reason for them to cover those... 
[00:06:30]  They're just wandering around that town looking for sorrow and sadness and people that are  willing to cry on camera and I mean, you know, it needs to be questioned.  Like, how much coverage are they obligated to give us?  Because it is a news story and then when does it, you know, start getting to be too much  and sensational and that this is coming from us.  We're idiots.  We're shock jocks.  We understand the value of that crap. 
[00:07:00]  But why are we...  Dr. Oz went there and did a show and I heard Dr. Phil is going to Newtown.  Why is Dr. Phil going there?  I know Dr. Oz did.  A leech.  Money, money, money.  Money.  They're leeches.  Yep.  Stupid Dr. Drew.  I tweeted him yesterday.  I couldn't help myself because they're like, well, what kind of effect will this have on  blah, blah, blah and blah, blah, blah.  And I go, Dr. Drew, could you please tell Wolf Blitzer that all this around the clock  coverage will absolutely encourage someone else to do this? 
[00:07:30]  You know that as a psychologist.  Yep.  Why don't you bring that into play?  Well, that would be bad for Dr. Drew's business now, wouldn't it?  I don't know, man.  When you're like in front of a funeral home as little kids are going in to bury their little  friend, I don't really understand why you need to show that in the way they are.  I honestly think we understand how fucked up and tragic this is. 
[00:08:00]  Because to take it to the point where you're intruding on people's private moments like  this and just trying to show how morbid it is and how sad it is, there's no reason for  it.  No fucking reason.  And especially under the guise that they're, I don't know what they're trying to prove  now.  Like before it's, oh, we need to show people information because it's news.  This isn't news.  We know this is happening.  Right.  We don't, they're not telling us something. 
[00:08:30]  We're like, oh, there's funerals.  Oh, there's children's funeral.  I didn't know that.  I had to see it on the news.  Well, they would say we're staying here because, you know, there's still a lot of the story  that still needs to be told.  We don't even know the motive.  Yeah.  You know, this and that.  So in between waiting for that lieutenant from the Connecticut State Police to give his  press conferences that he now only does once a day, by the way.  Thank you to him because he was doing it every hour and I'm not questioning that anymore.  I was at first.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Do we need a press conference every hour? 
[00:09:00]  But now, whatever.  So they're just waiting in between his press conferences.  So they got to fill up time.  Yeah.  Do you know, I did right out last night.  Tom Shalhoub made a great point.  He did like Andy Levy's role.  Right.  And I had, we thought of the guy running across the field example.  But what he said was, you know, when a rape victim is not identified, he said the media  does kind of a voluntary censorship or they don't read terrorist demands or they don't  think if you're a juvenile and you commit a murder, they won't. 
[00:09:30]  That's a voluntary censorship by the media.  So they can do it.  And people understand why they do it.  But in these cases, like not saying the name of the shooter, they just refuse to do it.  So it was a good point raised by him.  We didn't say his name once yesterday.  No.  And it was so easy not to do.  So easy.  You know, CNN also, I focused on CNN yesterday.  I'll focus on another channel today, certainly.  They do a five minute profile piece on this piece of shit.  And then go, we don't want to focus on the shooter. 
[00:10:00]  They keep calling him the shooter.  Because that's not too bad, right?  Right.  You got to keep it a little normal for everybody.  Yeah.  He's a piece of shit.  I think he could come up with something better than the shooter.  He goes, we don't want to focus on the shooter.  We want to focus on the victims.  And then they do a 30 second piece on one of the victims.  After they just did this huge, over the top, four or five minute profile on the guy.  It's all bullshit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't care.  We know what it is. 
[00:10:30]  Why are we the ones pointing this out?  And yeah, buddy, when I was saying there's no accountability with the news either.  There's no responsibility.  There's no, you know, there's certain things as far as, you know, slandering.  Someone goes and stuff.  But other than that, they pretty much have free reign.  And it was proven when they put out the brother's name as the shooter instead of the guy's name.  Right.  And let's just hypothetically say somebody who knew the older brother that had nothing to do with this heard that he did this and killed him. 
[00:11:00]  Sure.  And said this motherfucker and just lost his mind and killed the older brother based on nothing more than what the news said.  That's not farfetched.  Would there be any liability?  The news just says like, and then they say things like, uh, it was reported earlier.  Reported.  And they say some news outlets reported earlier.  It's like, no, fucker, you reported earlier.  You were one of them.  You were the one.  So at least fucking own it and say, ah, man, we messed up. 
[00:11:30]  But, you know, when something like this is unfolding, you're trying to do your best.  Come up with something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they all blame everyone else except themselves.  So the accountability and stuff.  A friend of mine had to actually go to the school right after the shooting.  And he came over last night and what he fucking told me and what he saw is un-fucking-believable.  Law enforcement, right?  Yeah.  Un-fucking-believable.  He could barely contain himself emotionally. 
[00:12:00]  It was like, it was strange.  Speaking very fast and manic and stopping in the middle of talking and just like putting his head in his hands and just fucking, you can't imagine seeing something like that.  Terrible.  And he said the news is fucking despicable, what they were doing in the middle of an investigation like that.  They're vying for position to try to get an angle into the school.  They were trying to get a camera on these dead kids. 
[00:12:30]  And they had their helicopters going above, just trying to get an angle on everything they could.  And just awful.  And then, you know, I wouldn't even say us.  Then, you know, some radio show will do something kind of edgy and maybe even stupid.  And the outrage that they'll show toward a couple of dopey radio guys, it doesn't match up.  Yeah.  What they do is despicable and way worse than anything we could do or those Australian DJs did or Imus did. 
[00:13:00]  You know, we could just talk from our experience.  Didn't you say something about...  Oh, I had my jaw on the floor last night listening to this.  Really?  Just fucking...  What about that one picture you're telling me about?  I'm not sure what you want to say.  Oh, well, it's the news.  The famous picture, it's right there.  Yeah, the press...  They keep showing it.  They show these pictures like the press was walking around taking pictures and these people were aware that there was at least people with cameras around. 
[00:13:30]  It's the one of the sister that's on the phone screaming bloody murder because she just found out her sister is one of the victims.  And it's a lot of these pictures...  It's plastered everywhere.  A lot of these pictures that you see of the parents walking with their children down the street and stuff like that, the press was kept very far away from this scene.  But they used those giant lenses and tripods to snap these pictures. 
[00:14:00]  These people weren't even aware there were cameras around.  Like, obviously, they wouldn't be posing for a camera.  But to just be in the moment like that and have no clue that somebody is on a tree line fucking taking pictures of you during that moment and then just publishing them like...  Like it's no big deal?  It's horrible.  It's just fucking terrible.  They're pigs, man.  They're pigs and they know they're doing it.  They're not...  At one point, they might not have known the effect it had when 24-hour news coverage first started. 
[00:14:30]  Maybe you can give them a pass.  They've been told time and time again.  Again, and in the post today, there's a picture of this little scumbag again.  They don't care that they are affecting, that they are causing people to...  They're inspiring other people to do this.  They know it.  They don't give a fuck.  They absolutely are.  They do not care.  No, man.  There's a lot of money to be made because, you know, in the end, we all are watching, or a lot of us are.  So I don't even know what the answer is.  He said you could see the scene, like what happened in there.  And there's a lot of speculation with law enforcement that he was done. 
[00:15:00]  Like, he could have done more damage, and he may have killed himself before law enforcement even showed up.  Well, I heard the sirens might have got him to do it.  Yeah.  Because he was, you know, he didn't want to go to jail, right?  But he's, like, the scene was kind of laid out like he had finished what he wanted to do or something. 
[00:15:30]  It's just, he was talking about the, it's just shit he can't even unsee.  Like, you could tell the kids were trying to run out of the room.  There was a pile of them in one area.  And apparently this motherfucker just kept shooting into the pile of kids that were there.  That's why they were shot so many times per kid.  Just a fucking, he said, like, you could tell a kid was, like, in mid-run. 
[00:16:00]  Right, I, I.  And hit in the, just shot in the back.  How the fuck, this fucking guy and the anger at the mother.  Really?  From all these people, yeah.  Yeah, oh boy.  Yeah, yeah, you could.  Oh, yeah.  Because she knew she had a fucking dud at home.  Yes.  A dud.  She looked a little unstable herself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With that wacky hat, the one picture they're showing of her a lot.  What was she, she was a preparer.  Ugh.  A fucking, yeah, doomsday prepper.  Right.  Shut up. 
[00:16:30]  Ugh.  Yeah, so that, that was like, I was stunned.  Because at first it felt, at first it felt bad for the mother.  Ugh.  I was all in going, ah, ah, ah, let's slow down a little bit.  Something's going on there.  Fuck her.  I'm feeling fucking bad for the mother.  Fuck her.  Yeah, that wacky picture.  Look at, look at her eyes.  Oh, she's a crazy person.  Something's not right there.  She's a crazy person.  Well, it was.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  That point Shalou made last night was really brilliant about the volley. 
[00:17:00]  And I know one is a victim and one is an assailant with a rape victim.  But the media can self-center.  I'm sorry, self-censor when they want to.  And they do.  Sure, they can.  Sure.  But they just won't do it.  We all know who the shooter is.  We all know his name.  We all know his picture.  Oh, yeah.  But they continue to show him.  Infamous, as they say.  I mean, out of everything we said yesterday, the one thing I kept thinking about all day  long was the fact that when we were growing up, you had these losers.  Mm-hmm.  And we all know at least one that fucking hung themselves in the basement. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Or I remember this one.  How many people do you know that put themselves in front of a train?  Ah, the old choo-choo train.  I knew a few of those.  Yeah.  Not, you know, close, but I knew of kids from my school.  Yeah.  There was a couple.  Get the old Long Island Railroad way out.  You weren't going to have, I don't know, who was around back then.  Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, one of those fucking guys. 
[00:18:00]  They only had a half hour every night.  Willoughby.  Willoughby.  They weren't going to focus on you.  It stops Willoughby.  And you can just fucking, yeah, use the choo-choo.  You're right.  They'd cover it for a couple minutes.  Because the whole nation, they should have, these guys say keep it a localized story.  And look, with 24 hours of news coverage, they have to do something.  But they become such vultures.  Well, the dishonesty of it drives me nuts.  Because they're asking the question, why, why, why? 
[00:18:30]  And they're absolutely part of it.  Yeah.  Why this shit happens.  That's the question they don't ask.  What's our part in it?  They never do the story on that.  They should.  Yeah, absolutely.  They should.  Because maybe they're in a tough spot.  Maybe they don't, well, they know what they're doing.  God, why am I giving them money in any fucking room?  Mm-hmm.  But why don't you ask that tough question?  Are we part of the problem?  Sure.  You have no problem blaming violent video games.  Yes, violent video games. 
[00:19:00]  You know, you can't wait to get some kind of expert to talk about that.  But your news coverage has nothing to do with it.  Yeah.  When it's absolutely being glorified to a point.  Yeah, it is.  I mean, there's no reason that a fucking army of reporters have to be there in that town.  And I don't understand, like, why a parent would allow their three-year-old to be interviewed.  Saw a lot of that the first day or two. 
[00:19:30]  Well, some of these parents are idiots, too.  Jesus Christ.  I can't imagine that.  No.  Can't imagine throwing your little three-year-old in front of cameras or four-year-old, whatever it was.  Maybe a four- or five-year-old.  I'd be wondering how, in God's name, you can fucking salvage some type of a normal life for the kid after that.  Like, what you gotta do.  And I don't think putting him in front of a fucking camera is the answer to how you try to get his head back together. 
[00:20:00]  Well, I mean, your friend, you know, he's been completely affected by this.  Totally.  And he's, he's, like, crazy.  He's maybe not used to what he saw, you know, up there, but he's used to seeing some shit.  Yeah, some shit.  Fuck yeah.  The parents are in shock, though.  Like, they don't know how to handle it.  Like, because parents have never had a news camera put in their kid's face.  These guys, the news knows what they're doing.  Like, that's, they, they, they do it every day.  It's what they fucking do.  Like, but, you know, parents with a kid who's seen something, that's probably the first time that's ever happened to them. 
[00:20:30]  So they're like, oh, okay.  Like, you know, you don't, I give them kind of a bigger break.  Like, than the, the press who's doing something purposeful and selfish.  Just from a parent's point of view, it just seems weird to me.  That's all.  You know.  Yeah.  A little strange.  But, man.  News Corp just doesn't give a fuck, man.  And I, and I hate to say, because I like those guys at Fox.  But they're like, like, because they own the post, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They just don't give a fuck. 
[00:21:00]  They showed that Joker photo, that, that dirt bag.  And they got this kid's picture in the paper again today.  They're doing everything.  They don't care.  Could we pull the Joker out of his cell today?  Could today be the day we just kill him?  How great would that be?  Shot in the temple.  You know, everyone's asking, how are we going to fucking stop this?  We need to change as a nation.  We need to.  Yeah, let's start by ripping him out of the fucking jail cell and fucking shooting him.  Yeah.  In a public square.  Because guess what?  We're not better than that.  I love, well, we're better than that. 
[00:21:30]  No, we're not.  Yeah, we shouldn't be.  We make believe we are.  We're not better than that.  Nope.  And if we're better than that, look what it gets us.  A school full of dead kids.  Like, if we're better than that, then maybe we shouldn't be.  Maybe being better than that is what gets us this, because we don't strike back hard enough.  Right.  Yeah, when you get the fucking news doing this and making that, you know, they're talking  about all kinds of other things that have to be done, you know, gun control and the mental 
[00:22:00]  health issue, but they're not talking about something that is so prevalent and so known  to affect other people that do these things, which is making an anti-hero out of these fucking  monsters.  Yeah.  And they're not even addressing that.  They don't even say, the one special you never see on the news is what is our part in  creating this?  Right.  These fucking pieces of shit never do that story. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, because they wonder about the video games.  It's, you know.  Oh, they mention that.  They mention every other aspect of what might do this, but not the fact that all these motherfuckers,  they know they do this for the recognition, they know it.  The news gives them the recognition, yet they don't even address it.  Do they realize the amount of people playing, quote, violent video games?  Do they have any idea?  If this was an actual problem, wouldn't it be just completely out of hand? 
[00:23:00]  You'd think.  And they absolutely do voluntary blackouts.  We're voluntary censorship.  They do it all the time.  They're doing it now with something else.  So why aren't they in this case?  That's the question.  Because they're afraid someone else will get the scoop.  Honestly, they're afraid someone else will get it and get the information and we'll all  go there.  So their integrity as a news organization and doing the right thing is not as important  as one up in the other network.  Yes.  Let me see that.  He's in New York.  Good morning to you, John.  Good morning, Zerrida.  Yeah, that's right.  There may be a ray of hope right now in the fiscal cliff. 
[00:23:30]  Okay.  Fiscal cliff.  We just missed it.  They did their fiscal cliff.  Very curious what the angle is today for all these news networks.  And then these guys capitalizing like Dr. Oz and fucking Dr. Phil.  Like, you ratings fucking vulture.  That's what it is.  You cocksucker vulture.  And that's so obvious.  So why are we on the low end of the old totem pole?  We're looked at like the scourge of society.  And then we have no desire to go up there and do some kind of radio show. 
[00:24:00]  You know what I mean?  We're pieces of shit.  Can you imagine if we went there and did a radio show?  Can you imagine what people would say?  But we have no desire to do that.  Because there's no phony reason that they're giving to be up there.  Dr. Phil, I'm going to go up there and talk to children and comfort people.  No, you're doing this for fucking ratings.  Of course.  Was he right there, Sam?  Is that it?  Yeah.  This fucking cheese dick motherfucker. 
[00:24:30]  And the stories are already coming in.  You know, they're arresting kids here and there for copycat threats.  It puts it in their mind.  We know this.  And then the news covers that.  This is something we know.  The kids basically tell law enforcement when they're arrested.  We know this is part of it.  Is Dr. Phil on Twitter?  Yeah, he's a cunt.  Oh.  He certainly is.  What's his name?  Dr. Phil?  Is this Dr. Phil?  I don't know.  Let's get some Dr. Phil tweets going.  Dr. Phil.  Let him know how you feel about him being up there, huh? 
[00:25:00]  You got a promo for his show?  I got to hear his angle.  Oh, yeah.  Let's hear what his fucking reason is.  Dr. Phil.  This community has been rocked by tragedy.  I met family face to face to help them.  I think of the parents that have kids that have kids.  How can they heal?  A gunman was in my son's classroom.  He is petrified.  Can you pause this?  Another gunman is going to come here for him.  He's not helping anyone.  It's too new.  God.  There's no way he's helping people. 
[00:25:30]  We need to pause.  And notice he's trying so hard to say that the reason he's doing this is to help.  It happened two days ago.  Yes.  Three days ago.  How are you helping?  You're still grieving.  You're not helping.  This is a conversation maybe you have down the road a month or two.  It's not helping anyone.  No.  What a hateable fuck this guy is.  He's not helping.  Don't buy this people.  And listen how many times he's, every time he talks, he's trying to justify him being  there.  And the reason he's there only a few days after it happened is, yes, as a nation, we 
[00:26:00]  will move on, unfortunately, to other things.  That's a fact.  And secondly, it's because it's so raw.  He's going to get a lot more emotion and people crying.  He's not helping anyone.  Fuck, I just, I just, you know, I just want to educate more and more people about the  media in general.  But you're part of the media.  I think we do it a little differently.  And I think we've proven it over the years, believe it or not.  We are what we are.  We've never fucking hid behind some fake bullshit. 
[00:26:30]  That's fucking despicable.  He's a despicable.  He's on Twitter as Dr. Phil.  People are, honestly, because everybody reads their app mentions.  I don't care who you are.  Yes, you do.  We all read our app mentions.  If you're on Twitter, you're reading a fucking thing.  I would absolutely.  Not me.  Let him know.  I don't read my app mentions.  Too many haters.  Got to keep it fucking, fucking clean, man.  Let's hear what else he's got to say.  This is so.  Tell our children.  Do you feel any fear about going back to school?  I just don't want that to happen again. 
[00:27:00]  All new Dr. Phil.  I hope it's an all new Dr. Phil.  I fucking hope so.  How stupid would this be if it was from June and you went to Newtown for no reason?  Are you scared to go back to school?  No.  Why would I, Phil?  Didn't warn everybody.  I would have, I would have, I would have went, what do you think, Dr. Phil?  Yeah.  Dr. Phil, what do you think?  I'm a kid.  No, actually, I can't wait.  You dummy.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I don't want to miss the Winter Festival.  Fucking idiot. 
[00:27:30]  Holy fuck.  Fucking idiot.  Idiot.  Look, do what you, and you know what?  Do what you have to do.  But don't fucking make believe it's for some other reason.  That's what he, you know, because if he said the real reason, he would fucking be the scourge  of society, for some reason, these dumb fucking cunt housewives that watch him are like,  Oh, Dr. Phil is going up to talk to the poor people.  Oh, he's such a good man. 
[00:28:00]  Did you see the Dr. Phil?  Oh, God.  What a piece of shit.  He's hateable, right?  Yeah.  Fuck Dr. Phil.  Oh.  Would you leave cum on his mustache?  Yes.  You Jeffrey Tambor-looking motherfucker.  Shave the stupid mustache.  You're creeping out the kids.  Oh, God.  Holy fuck.  Asshole.  It's just so much phoniness. 
[00:28:30]  And it's not even that deep.  We're not geniuses exposing shit here, people.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  Slow down.  What the fuck?  This is so fucking transparent and shallow, anybody can see what their motives are here.  Why isn't there more fucking outrage?  Assault rifles in this country.  Well, there are so many Democrats who right now are talking about gun restrictions.  That's why these particular rifles are flying off the shelves.  Last weekend, Colorado State set a new record for single-day background checks in San Diego 
[00:29:00]  at the Northwest Armory Gun Store.  Biggest day they'd had in 20 years.  Keep in mind, this is Saturday, the day after Newtown, and in Southwest Ohio at a gun show  in Cincinnati.  The building was full.  They had a line of 400 people out the door.  There you go.  Now, keep in mind, there was in this country an assault weapons ban that went into effect  back in 1994.  And Alan Gottlieb from the Second Amendment Foundation was asked last night on The O'Reilly 
[00:29:30]  show whether or not that assault weapons ban really did much in the way of slowing.  All right, let me go to this now.  The president has asked Vice President Biden to take the lead in examining the country's  gun laws.  Outspoken gun control advocate, New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, had this to say yesterday.  Gun violence is a national epidemic and a national tragedy that demands more than words.  We are the only industrialized country that has this problem. 
[00:30:00]  In the whole world, the only one.  And that's why we need immediate national action from the president and from Congress.  It should be at the top of their agenda.  But it won't be.  It's not going to change, people.  There you go.  The guy in Fox said it.  Everyone went out.  Everyone went out.  Not everyone, but a lot of people went out and went and got guns.  Because, mark my words, there will be another assault weapons ban.  This will spur it on.  There will be an assault weapons ban.  If you go out now and buy what they consider an assault weapon, which is a semi-automatic 
[00:30:30]  rifle that looks like a military rifle but isn't, doesn't act like one.  It just looks like one.  If you go out and buy one right now, it will increase in value by at least tenfold after  the ban.  So it's almost like you're making a fucking investment.  Because the way these weapon bans work, they're grandfathered in.  As long as you own them, you can keep them. 
[00:31:00]  They don't go around collecting your weapons.  If they did, that would be a huge fucking issue.  But what they do is they ban the sale of these after a certain date.  So whatever's already in the marketplace can still be sold.  You cannot sell new ones after the date of the ban.  So people are going out and fucking buying them.  I, as a matter of fact, have looked at a few that I'm considering purchasing because I know 
[00:31:30]  I won't be able to purchase them after a ban.  And there's a couple of rifles that I kind of wanted for my collection that I've been  putting off that I will probably buy in the very near future because I know I won't be  able to after this ban is in place.  You're a prepper, man.  I'm a prepper.  Yes, for bulls and doomsday.  Like anything else that people like variety in, I like a variety of weaponry because I  enjoy shooting different types of guns.  It's fun. 
[00:32:00]  It's challenging.  It's a good way to, you know, just enjoy some fucking time that I have at the range.  Do you think the two sides should meet in the middle or not?  We got a lot of people out there that, you know, have a problem with guns now.  Here's what I think people should do.  Have a little dialogue about what is, what will honestly make a difference.  You can't, a couple of days after a tragedy, come up with an answer to a question that has 
[00:32:30]  been a quandary for people for years.  It ain't going to happen.  I don't think an assault weapons ban is the answer to these problems, quite frankly.  I think that's where we're headed.  Uh, and I think people are going to be sorely disappointed at the result if that's all that  we're doing is banning what they call assault weapons. 
[00:33:00]  I think they are going to be gravely disappointed and, uh, delusional to think that that is going  to stop these things from happening.  I hate to say it.  I think it's kind of an empty gesture in the end.  It is.  It's symbolic, if nothing else.  My, where I sit today, I would rather than focus on making the schools way safer, way  safer.  Uh, but someone was fucking giving me some numbers yesterday and wow, billions of dollars 
[00:33:30]  we're talking.  My, my billions of dollars.  My buddy last night was to also telling me some suggestions that have been knocked around.  Uh, you go into a bank, it's very secure, right?  You know, that's for cash.  How about for fucking kids in schools, uh, have, uh, have things like safe rooms, maybe  reinforce the bathrooms where you can shove every fucking kid in there, close the door.  It's reinforced.  There's a phone in there. 
[00:34:00]  You could call the police and they are safe in that room.  It's a safe room.  It's a money issue.  It's a money issue.  Exactly.  To do that for every school.  That's your, but if people don't want armed people on campus or that there's other ways  to secure the kids, make every classroom like a, a bank teller where, where the, the door  is locked at all times with maybe a, a code keypad to get in.  There's bulletproof glass on the window.  Money.  It's of course, it's all about money. 
[00:34:30]  I mean, these are all great ideas.  Don't get me wrong.  The only thing is to keep a gunman from the, a barrier between the gunman and the students.  Right.  At any given moment.  The only problem is we'll have a fire or something.  I know it's a crazy idea, but how do you get the everybody in and out quickly?  Well, exactly.  But, but you know, the fireproof to schools, most of the schools would be tough to burn  them down anyway.  That's where my outrage is today.  I, you know, everyone's yelling and screaming for change and this and that.  And I just don't, I just don't believe in our country enough to think that we could, we'll 
[00:35:00]  absolutely make significant change.  They won't change at all.  This gun control will be completely out of control.  Fucking, uh, your kids will not feel safe in school anymore.  They, they barely felt safe before this.  They'll, they'll make some little changes here and there.  The gun issue.  Fuck no, man.  Cause neither side wants to listen to each other.  They could do all the banning they want.  The truth of the matter is that it's not sound minded people that are doing this. 
[00:35:30]  They don't acknowledge your fucking laws.  The problem is when something like this happens, nothing does change.  It's like, it's almost like it's an excuse for the country to have the same arguments over  and over again.  Literally these dead children have just become a talking point.  Right.  Like, like people with guns and they believe it, say, well, if someone, there was a gun  would have stopped it.  And people who don't like guns say, well, there's no guns.  You couldn't have shot them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And nothing gets done. 
[00:36:00]  It's exhausting.  It's exhausting.  That's why I don't like talking politics.  Well, when I'm not here, I know it's kind of important to the radio show because nothing  ever gets done.  Nothing changes.  No one ever makes a, no one ever says, you know what?  You made a good point there.  No one ever says that when you're talking politics, fucking abortion, gun control, all  that shit.  Cause every good point.  Wait for that person to stop talking so they can make their point.  Every good point they make is a bad point that I can't make.  Right.  Like every, it's, it's, it's almost like people think there's 10 total points. 
[00:36:30]  And if you get one, there's only nine possibly left.  Nobody goes back and forth.  Yeah.  No one ever says that.  You know what?  That's, that's interesting.  Well, that's a good point.  I want to hear more about that.  We'll agree to disagree as close as they come.  Oh Christ.  That's as close as they come.  Well, the, the anti-gun, um, pants end of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The, they, they absolutely have the upper hand right now.  Yeah.  I mean, the NRA isn't even talking.  By the way, they are not.  They have been, they have also despicable fucking cowardice from that organization because 
[00:37:00]  this is a time where even though they're going to say, well, we were mourning like other  Americans, everybody knows their agenda is being talked about.  And those fucking pussies haven't come out and said one thing in support of the families.  Nothing.  They, they, they absolutely should have said something.  Despicable.  Something should have been said.  So they just clammed up.  Uh, they're not saying anything, but they, they definitely, the, uh, the anti-gun side  has, has the upper hand right now because the emotion's running rampant. 
[00:37:30]  Everyone's talking about gun control.  They could put a bill through to ban certain weapons right now and they would have a good  chance of getting it passed because, uh, on the tail, on the, uh, the heels of this, it's  just, everyone wants it.  But what is it really going to work?  Is it a real solution to this?  No, I don't see this working.  And the next time it happens, there's going to be more talk about what, what other guns  can be banned, what other situations. 
[00:38:00]  Would it, would it be, uh, just a bandaid on the, on the wound?  I, it would help people's peace of mind until the next fucking shooting.  They would have peace of mind.  Absolutely.  Till the next shooting.  Till the next shooting.  Yeah.  There would certainly be a shitload of guns out there that could do some damage.  And believe me, everyone that thinks about, uh, assault weapons, um, they, the anti-gun  people, they don't know what it is.  They honestly think it's a machine gun.  They think it's a military machine gun that's full automatic and firing giant bullets at, 
[00:38:30]  uh, horrific rates of fire.  They also have no idea that a, a assault weapon ban does not mean you cannot have them.  It means you can't buy new ones.  Right.  But, but it doesn't mean you can't have them.  They think that the, the police are going to knock on everyone's door and go, uh, get,  get your assault weapons, give them to me.  Right.  That's not going to happen either.  Well, we, well, you know, I said it yesterday.  We set ourselves down this road a long time ago, way before we were on this planet, hundreds 
[00:39:00]  of years ago.  Yeah.  It's going to be really tough to curtail the gun culture in America.  We are a nation of, um, we do have a gun culture here.  We have, our nation was built on it.  It was, it was, it's been looked at, um, in a, a kind of heroic way to the guy with the  gun, the sheriff in the old West, the, uh, the soldier, the, the, uh, dirty Harry, you  know, all that stuff. 
[00:39:30]  And I'm not, I'm absolutely not saying movies.  I'm just pointing out that we do have a gun culture, whether that's a, uh, uh, horrific,  bad thing.  I don't know whether it contributes to what's going on, I guess, but that's who we are until  we could change the entire nation.  I mean, that's part of like the Japanese will buy girls' panties out of fucking vending  machines. 
[00:40:00]  We love our guns.  That's a part of who our nation is.  And we'd buy those out of the vending machine too, by the way.  Of course we would.  Newtown's board of education describing how she feels just hollow to our Wolf Witzer.  Oh, it's been horrific.  Um, from the moment we all heard the news, it was devastating to know that someone had  come into the school with a gun.  That alone was horrible enough because it's a place of peace and joy.  But now as we go forward and we've learned the names and now we're going through the 
[00:40:30]  grueling process of the funerals, um, it's very, very, very hard.  We, everyone uses the word hollow.  That's where we're at right now.  Well, we know that.  This is a big step in the recovery process for Newtown students and they're.  Look at them.  They're just fucking private moments.  These private moments people are trying to have.  And there's just, there's not, they choose getting the story over an ounce of dignity.  And it's not about getting the news to people because that's their job.  Students will return to school today.  Soledad, there will be a two hour delay and students, parents, teachers may be a little 
[00:41:00]  anxious returning back to school.  Oh, don't worry.  There'll be plenty of cameras on the kids walking into school.  Just in case a gunman shows up, they'll get on video.  Cocksuckers.  As you mentioned, Sandy Hook Elementary students will still remain out.  I just wonder what the 43rd president makes of all this.  Uh, President Bush, George W. Bush has stayed, uh, quiet.  Uh, he, the assault weapons ban expired, uh, during his presence. 
[00:41:30]  Just keeps going.  It's good they could tie Bush into it.  The, uh, yeah, yeah, exactly.  The, um, we got a guy that says arm and train the custodial staff.  I don't know about you, but yeah, the custodians I knew in school, I don't want them with a  gun.  How about everyone think about the custodians from their school right now?  Would you want them armed?  I want the custodian from fucking, uh, breakfast club to be armed.  I remember one custodial worker in my, I think it was my grammar school.  He was the one that loved chestnuts.  Yes. 
[00:42:00]  Couldn't wait to, you know, cook up some chestnuts for everyone.  Chestnuts.  What the fuck?  You want him armed?  You know, these fucking moments that people have when you want to maybe kneel down in  front of a, a memorial and, and pay your respects or, or just grieve and put something  down or light a candle.  Do you honestly think these people want cameras in their fucking face and to be questioned  once, once get the fuck out and leave them alone?  I know I'm interrupting you with a, I watched a lot yesterday. 
[00:42:30]  People are coming from all over the place and, and you get the feeling they kind of want  to be on camera.  Oh, I'm sure some of them do.  But I mean, the ones that are directly affected, no, but you got people that are kind of going  there.  Well, they wouldn't be there if the cameras weren't there either.  And they best.  How many times did you hear, uh, where'd you come from?  And it's a far away place.  Why?  I just felt like I had to be here.  Cause you're a mental patient.  The people that come there from miles away are insane.  So, but the one, I think your point, you know, the ones, uh, closer to the situation, 
[00:43:00]  of course not.  Yeah.  And I, you know, we got to be fair.  I mean, I think, I think there's a purpose to cover some of this stuff.  It's just the over the top and just like, don't worry.  We're all sad.  Like just, I don't think they're sad enough.  I think we can find more stuff.  The music's not somber enough when you show the faces of the children.  Well, the music shit drives me nuts.  And then, uh, NBC, uh, NBC today show. 
[00:43:30]  Somebody tweeted me last night, the graphic they got for this.  Oh no.  What was it?  How about you just fucking put a little graphic?  It's, it's just all the, all the kids like faces and shit.  It's just the fire and it's just like, it's a doom and gloom, uh, NBC today show logo.  What is this?  And yeah, what is this?  Oh, you're just coming up with some, uh, somber music.  There's a folder.  There's just sad news.  We'll, we'll be back with more from, oh my God. 
[00:44:00]  This is what Bob should fucking play in the background whenever he calls us.  Guys, uh, oh geez, it doesn't look good.  It's holy Jesus.  And you know, if you get some of these guys at a bar, they would probably tell you they'd  rather hear zippity doodah, zippity yay.  Of course.  They're very, very happy all the, all the camera time they're getting.  Well, one thing.  They got a lot of eyes on them.  One thing that gets exposed with these idiots because they can't fucking keep the facade  up long enough. 
[00:44:30]  Uh, whenever they're doing a live shot of somebody and it's so crowded with press there that there's  other press in the background.  So you'll see the woman, you know, talking about it and being, being very somber.  But then off in the background, you'll see another news guy talking with his pals and  he's like laughing about shit.  Right.  And in two seconds, he'll be on camera going, oh, oh, just a somber, hollow mood here.  Right.  Oh boy.  Meanwhile, behind him is another guy just laughing with his cameraman.  They've been around a few of these people. 
[00:45:00]  They can't wait to get to the bar and drink their faces off and fuck each other.  Oh boy.  Exactly.  Wonder what bar they're all hanging out at.  Yeah.  Right.  So fucking pricks, fucking pricks.  There was something else.  Um, oh, enough is dumb fucking emo Phillips face.  Let me see.  And his dumb dick hairdo.  His hair looks like a cock head on his head.  He looks like Bill Schultz.  I thought of that last night on the show. 
[00:45:30]  I didn't say it, but I said, I told Bill off the camera, he looks like you.  Oh no, it's Bill Schultz.  That's terrible.  That's, uh, uh, Bill's creepier.  He really is.  A ghoul.  Sky marshals on every flight, but we can't, well, they're not on every flight, sky marshals.  They're here and there.  And the airlines are paying for that.  Shoot the hostage.  But we can't have someone protecting the kids.  Do you even believe there are sky marshals in the air?  Sometimes they board first. 
[00:46:00]  It's easy just to throw that out there.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, but it might be just a sky marshal that has to fly like the rest of us schmucks.  Hey, he's in there.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about him.  We got him up there.  Oh.  I've never seen one.  I don't know.  I know they've got to be a little undercover and all, but do you really think they're  up there?  It's clever ruse.  Let's see.  What happened in Connecticut is exactly what happens in the movie.  Let's go to Derek on Long Island. 
[00:46:30]  Derek.  Hey, how are you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Yeah, this movie came out earlier this year with Tilda Swinton.  It's the exact same thing that just happened.  She has this kid, and the kid's a fucking monster, and no one's believing her because  he's a little kid.  So he grows up.  He kills the parents.  He goes to his school.  He kills all the fucking students.  Oh, really?  It's the exact same plot of this movie.  Yeah, yeah.  It's on demand now.  I think Showtime and HBO and all that shit.  It's called We Need to Talk About Kevin.  Maybe he thought... 
[00:47:00]  Oh, I heard about that.  Huh.  Yeah.  Amy Schumer told me about that.  I heard it was really good.  It's a big movie.  Thanks for giving the whole fucking thing away.  Oh, yeah.  Really, man.  Prick.  No, no.  It's worth seeing.  It's definitely an arty film, you know, because Tilda Swinton only does...  I like Arty.  I'm happy he's working.  Yeah.  But, uh...  It's the same fucking...  It's got a restaurant on.  It's the premise.  I think fucking John C. Reilly's in it.  Completely miscast as the dad.  Oh, yeah.  I'll take a look at it.  I think I know this movie a little bit. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, see the movie.  It's good.  All right, shut up.  We're going to watch the trailer.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's see.  Gladys, I see small, so I can't see it.  I know.  Oh, God.  Faster than a roller coaster.  That's a very happy family scenes of mother, father, and the kids.  Oh, uh-oh.  Uh, boy.  It's got ominous.  Just because you're used to something doesn't mean you like it. 
[00:48:00]  You're used to me.  Oh, boy.  You wake up and you watch TV.  Shit.  Get in your car and you listen to the radio.  The mother looks like she's a little troubled.  Hey, you go to your little job or your little school, but you're not going to hear about that on the six o'clock news.  Tilda Swinton. 
[00:48:30]  You know where you're spending the afterlife.  I'm going straight to hell.  Because nothing is really happening.  All right?  This isn't telling you much.  It's got so bad that half the time the people on TV, they're watching TV.  What are all these people watching?  Ah. 
[00:49:00]  People like me.  Oh, Jesus.  They didn't give the whole movie away.  Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?  Huh.  Oh, my God.  I just got chills, man.  That's kind of, uh, ominous.  Yeah.  Fucking just got chills watching that.  I hope that caller, by the way, hits a fucking pole for giving the whole movie away.  I know.  You cock.  Then again, he made us want to talk about it.  And then again, we didn't know about the movie until he brought it up.  I know.  But I heard about it.  I had a fair warning.  I just didn't see it.  Wow.  That gave me chills.  Holy fuck.  Might have to, uh, see that there, uh, later on. 
[00:49:30]  Hmm.  Jiminy Cricket.  God, is Dr. Phil a cunt?  Apologies you, huh?  Makes me physically ill.  Dr. Phil is a fucking opportunist cocksucker.  I will give him a little bit.  If he went up there, uh, maybe, uh, a few more weeks, maybe.  For a hat!  But, uh, he's not helping anyone with, uh, this, uh, close to the tragedy.  No.  I don't think so.  No. 
[00:50:00]  Why don't we eat our goods?  Sure, we can do that.  Come on.  Yeah.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Yeah, they asked me to weigh in on my, uh, Dr. Steve is going to Newtown.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Show people that it could be worse.  I could live here.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Bring some of my wine to, uh, dull the people's senses.  Yeah, I passed out some wine.  They used it to clean the streets.  Ah!  They thought it was cleaning flood. 
[00:50:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Free prostate exams for everyone.  Yeah, I'm helping.  Yeah, but...  To help with their grief.  Yeah, I'm actually giving them to the police and firemen, uh, not to any of the victims'  families, just the hunky firemen from the calendar.  So, you know, they suffered enough.  They suffered enough.  Yeah.  Ah!  First responder.  Yeah, first responder.  Make sure their prostate's all right.  Yeah.  Ah!  I wet my finger with my mouth.  Ah!  Ah!  And I'll check their firefighting prostate, uh, just to make sure they're fit for duty, 
[00:51:00]  and they don't have any fluid leaking down the back of their leg.  If they do, I'll make wine out of it.  Dr. Steve goes to Newtown.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Jesus.  Hey, um, did you see, uh, the pre- the three presidents speaking?  Uh, uh...  Video that's going around?  Uh, no.  Yeah, we should play that after the break.  Any good.  Three different presidents.  You got...  Oh, right.  Yes.  You got the Clinton, you got the Bush, you got the Obama, and, uh, this guy kind of mashed  them all together. 
[00:51:30]  Three significant speeches after a school shooting, and it's pretty much the exact fucking speech.  Same horse shite.  It's worth playing.  We could do that, uh, after the break.  Break.  Bye.  Bye.  This is the Opie Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  The Pepe Sinclair News Company presents Personal Hygiene and You, A Beginner's Guide.  You know, as we move into the future, personal hygiene is becoming more and more important to  our daily lives. 
[00:52:00]  Why, look, there is Hollywood celebrity Jim Norton.  Mr. Norton, what is the most important part of your daily hygiene regimen?  I like my own asshole to sparkle.  And sparkle it does.  How do you achieve such a sparkle, Mr. Norton?  This is how I wipe my ass.  Here's the toilet.  I put one foot up and I go like this, and I arch my asshole out, and I fucking open the  cheeks, and I make sure that I get in there.  I put a finger all the way up in until it's fucking completely clean.  Even on those extra messy days?  If it looks like there's still more work to be done, then I'll do, like, a wet wipe or  whatever, and I'll wrap it around my finger and push it almost up. 
[00:52:30]  You never know when a massage therapist might have to get in there, you know?  Why, here comes Teddy, the neighborhood scamp.  Hi, Teddy.  Do you clean your rectum?  Every day.  Why don't you show Jim how you do it?  Wait, you just, you just, you don't go in?  No, Mr. Norton.  I just wipe it like I thought I was supposed to.  Oh, no.  I gotta get in there because I like my asshole to feel clean.  When I was a kid, I didn't wipe good enough.  My asshole would get raw.  So I've learned.  Oh, I get it. 
[00:53:00]  Thanks, Mr. Norton.  Ha ha.  You're welcome, Teddy.  We've all learned a little something today.  I like a nice, clean ass.  Makes me feel like a better person.  We couldn't agree more.  Tune in to our next personal hygiene lesson when we'll go over the schmegma removal process.  And remember, clean assholes for a better tomorrow.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:53:30]  So we got this video.  We'll put it up on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  If you haven't seen it yet, it's called The Three Speeches on YouTube.  And you got three presidents talking about school shootings.  You got Clinton, Bush, and Obama. 
[00:54:00]  And, you know, they mashed this up.  Put it all together.  Clinton, 1999.  So what school shooting was that in 1999?  99?  Just trying to think of a reference point here.  Not a nine?  Not a nine.  Oh.  And then you got Bush, and then you got Obama from the other night.  You got the Columbine?  I think so.  Columbine was 99 already.  Yeah, that's right.  13, 14 years ago.  Yeah, okay.  So you got Clinton after Columbine, and then Bush after, I'm not sure what school shooting. 
[00:54:30]  Columbine, by the way, seven years after an assault weapon.  Six, seven years after an assault weapon ban was signed.  Columbine happened.  And now they're going to just do the same thing.  Was Bush Virginia Tech?  Oh, probably right.  Yeah.  All right, let's play this.  Sammy.  Begin by saying that Hillary and I are profoundly shocked and saddened by the tragedy today in Littleton.  Our nation is shocked and saddened by the news of the shootings at Virginia Tech today. 
[00:55:00]  This afternoon, I spoke with Governor Malloy and FBI Director Mueller.  I've spoken with Governor Tim Kaine and Virginia Tech President Charles Steger.  I have spoken with Governor Bill Owens and County Commission Chair Patricia Holloway.  And made it clear he will have every single resource that he needs to investigate this heinous crime, care for the victims, counsel, their families. 
[00:55:30]  To stand ready to assist local law enforcement, the schools, the families, the entire community during this time of crisis and sorrow.  To stand ready to help local law enforcement and the local community in any way we can during this time of sorrow.  We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years.  I know the other communities that have been through this are also ready to do whatever they can to help. 
[00:56:00]  The exact toll has not yet been confirmed.  We don't know yet all the hows or whys of this tragedy.  And each time I learn the news, I react not as a president, but as anybody else would.  Schools should be places of safety and sanctuary in learning.  We must do more to reach out to our children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their conflicts with words, not weapons. 
[00:56:30]  They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own.  The impact is felt in every American classroom and every American community.  Whether it's an elementary school in Newton or a shopping mall in Oregon or a temple in Wisconsin or a movie theater in Aurora or a street corner in Chicago.  These neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. 
[00:57:00]  Perhaps now America would wake up to the dimensions of this challenge if it could happen in a place like Littleton.  And we could prevent anything like this from happening again.  And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.  Today our nation grieves with those who have lost loved ones at Virginia Tech. 
[00:57:30]  Our hearts are broken today.  For the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost.  We hold the victims in our hearts, we lift them up in our prayers, and we ask a loving God to comfort those who are suffering today.  Loving God. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  May God bless the memory of the victims.  And in the words of Scripture,  Let's say Scripture.  Heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds.  To the people of the community of Littleton,  I can only say tonight that the prayers of the American people are with you.  Thank you very much.  Isn't that wild?  You know, it's...  Some of that stuff obviously would be said by anyone, but it's, you know... 
[00:58:30]  I don't think the president should comment on stuff like that.  Now, here's why.  I'm thinking about watching this.  Yeah.  It makes...  Like, can you imagine you're some nobody?  I mean, sure, all of us can, but...  The president.  And the president is talking...  Only for that reason.  You have to press the attention, yeah.  You're getting the...  He should only respond if a question is asked and say,  Look, local officials are handling that.  It's a...  Even though...  Not to be cold-hearted, but literally,  I think it makes it a bigger story when the president is talking.  Kind of like how we don't negotiate with terrorists. 
[00:59:00]  You know what I mean?  And we just kind of like almost blow it off.  It's weird.  You know, hearing Clinton say that we have to do more.  That was 1999, and I'm not faulting Clinton in particular.  I'm certainly faulting our government in general.  By the way, I did not have sex with that woman.  Very similar speeches.  There you go.  Fox showing his picture again.  This includes a computer hard drive that was severely damaged for some reason. 
[00:59:30]  What sparked his outrage?  What sparked his outrage?  Who gives a fuck?  His computer was damaged for some reason.  He fucking wiped his hard drive out.  He did something to it.  He decided, fuck that.  You know, you're not going through my shit after I'm gone.  But who gives a fuck what sparked his outrage?  Who cares?  First of all, it's going to be something crazy.  It's not going to be this well-thought-out fucking motive.  What, if he had a B on a test, and we're all going to go,  Oh, he should have got an A.  I understand it. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, boy, now I get it.  It's going to be...  All positive.  All positive.  You're going to be safe.  You're safe in schools.  It's got to be so hard if you're a person who survived that massacre.  I mean, how do you...  We get it, idiot.  It's going to be hard for people.  It's going to be hard for these students when you're suffering on your own.  I just don't know how they're going to do it.  One of the first things I said to my colleagues yesterday was,  I want to know if you're okay.  Those flowers behind Robert there in tribute to all those children and adults killed.  Thanks, Robert. 
[01:00:30]  Steve?  Thanks, Critch.  So, what is the future of gun...  God almighty, they're all the fucking same yammering assholes.  Over and over again.  The same fucking thing on every shit channel.  Not a sincere moment from any of them.  No.  You know what would be sincere?  Other being respectful and not sticking a camera in the face of a fucking six-year-old  who just ran out of a fucking...  Watching her friends be murdered.  Right.  That would be sincere.  Right.  I had the most uncomfortable moment in a movie theater ever yesterday. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, boy.  I have to say it.  Yeah, of course.  We have Judd Apatow coming in tomorrow for his new movie, This Is 40.  And I swear to you, I'm not this guy.  When some shit goes down, you know, you see, like, trailers being banned.  Sometimes they blow off the movie and put it on the shelf for a little while.  You know the deal.  We've seen it time and time again.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a scene in This Is 40 that I think he has to take out of the movie. 
[01:01:30]  Were you cringing?  Not only was I cringing, the whole movie theater felt incredibly uncomfortable.  Incredibly uncomfortable.  Albert Brooks is in this movie.  He plays Paul Rudd's father.  They want us to see the movie before he comes in, so I'm proving I saw the movie, by the way.  Yeah.  Judd Apatow would not come in here unless we saw the movie.  Yes.  And so Albert Brooks is Paul Rudd's father.  Father, he has three kids of his own. 
[01:02:00]  They happen to be triplets, okay?  He has a money situation.  Paul Rudd is giving him money all the time.  Paul Rudd finally talks to his father, Albert Brooks.  You know, I can't give you money anymore.  I'm hurting myself.  And they're having this heart-to-heart.  And the kids are outside playing.  So Albert Brooks, in a comedic way, goes, well, why don't you come outside with me?  I'm going to kill two out of the three.  Oof.  And I'll be left with the good one, the one.  So he goes outside, and they're all playing in a kiddie pool, the three triplets, all with blonde hair, right? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  And Albert Brooks picks up the hose and starts squirting them, like it's a gun, going, I'm not sure if he said bang, bang, bang,  but made it very obvious that he's shooting the kids as they're playing in the kiddie pool.  And hits the one kid and goes, all right, you're dead.  And he falls down.  Oh, no.  And then he goes on to the second kid, he's squirting them with the hose, bang, bang, bang, or whatever the hell he actually sends.  And you're now dead, too.  The whole theater, you can feel. 
[01:03:00]  No shit.  Stop breathing.  It was incredible.  I've never felt an energy like that in a room before.  Everyone was incredibly uncomfortable.  Because they were all obviously fully aware.  And you know, Judd probably thought of that, too, and said, fuck it, we can't censor at this point.  And he's, you know, he must have thought of that when the shooting happened.  You always think of what you have coming out.  I'm surprised.  Maybe we're the first outlet, but it'll certainly be brought up in the coming days.  Just incredibly uncomfortable. 
[01:03:30]  I bet.  With the hose and the kids and the kiddie pool shooting them.  Mock shooting them and telling them to fall down because they're dead.  That's pretty uncomfortable.  Yeah, I felt really uncomfortable.  You think he'll pull it?  Pull that scene?  Well, we'll ask him tomorrow about it, certainly, what his thoughts are.  We're not for censorship.  No, no, no.  It just felt so fucking wrong and weird.  And he didn't, you know, obviously the movie was made probably close to a year ago at this point, right? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  So.  Yeah, it would be psychotic if he actually went and shot that scene after on purpose.  Oh, God.  And threw it in.  Then you'd have to question his judgment.  Yes.  I want to give a shout-out to, we don't do shout-outs often, but Phil Hendry's a terrific radio guy.  Hendry.  Very different and unique.  And a fan of our show, by the way.  He's a fan of ours.  He's in the fucking movie.  Gets a little cameo.  He does?  Yeah, he does a really good job with it.  He's on screen for maybe two or three minutes. 
[01:04:30]  So I just want to say hey to Phil Hendry.  I know this will get back to him.  I was very happy to see him.  What does he play?  Yeah.  Paul Rudd is riding his bike, and Phil Hendry opens his car door, and Paul Rudd goes flying into it,  and then the exchange is pretty good.  Oh, okay.  Pretty fucking good.  Hey, good for him.  Yeah, good for Phil Hendry.  Good for him.  Has anybody been following the anonymous war on Westboro Baptist Church?  Oh, you know what?  I've been following your war. 
[01:05:00]  It's hilarious.  Absolutely hilarious.  Oh, my God.  Those tweets are fucking funny, man.  I forgot we didn't talk about this yesterday.  They...  Anonymous rules.  They are the greatest men.  I bow to Anonymous.  Yeah.  Because this is something...  They're doing something for all of us on this one.  This is like something we'd all like to see done.  These fucking...  These disgusting people having all their personal info given out.  Anonymous went in, and they took over this guy...  What the fuck is his name?  Well, first of all, just to really break it down, the Westboro Baptist Church is... 
[01:05:30]  Are they up there?  I don't know, but they're planning on protesting these funerals.  And I know there's a mass email or tweet going around to sign the petition to have them recognized as a hate group.  Because if you're a hate group, then some things can be done, I guess.  Lose your tax exempt status.  All that shit.  Okay.  So anyway, I'm not sure if they actually made it up there for the funerals, but they're certainly telling everyone they're going to go up there for the little kids' funerals.  That's just terrific.  And so Anonymous...  Yeah, Sam's right. 
[01:06:00]  The guy's name is Cosmo the God.  And he fucking hacked and took over Shirley Roper Phelps' Twitter.  And he really hasn't been saying anything crazy.  He's just been retweeting nice things and God bless the victims.  He's handling it in a pretty interesting way.  And he's just retweeting people who are saying nice things about the victims and the hate crime petition.  I'm sorry, the hate repetition.  But it's so nice to see that fucking pig not have her Twitter.  And even though I think that they have the right to be on Twitter, I really do think that America, we have to tolerate their right to speech. 
[01:06:30]  But I just think it's funny that somebody took it over and a big fuck you to the Westboro Baptist Church.  So I've been arguing...  Not even arguing.  They haven't been responding.  Because the angle I'm taking when I'm hitting this fucking pig and this whole family is...  There was a documentary done in two...  And they're unflappable.  The Westboro Church.  You're never going to say anything to move them.  Nothing you say biblically will bother them.  You're never going to outthink them when it comes to the Bible.  What about love?  I love when people come at them with that one. 
[01:07:00]  You're not...  It's not the Jesus I know.  They win 50 out of 50 times.  They win that argument.  Westboro.  So in 2007, there was a documentary.  This guy.  Sam, we can find that online.  And also, someone get Jimmy's tweets together.  Please.  I was just smashing them.  They're worth funny.  Fucking reading today.  Some of them.  But there was a...  Oh, you know what?  In my Twitter timeline, I think I retweeted the video.  There's a video of apparently Shirley Roper Phelps. 
[01:07:30]  Her oldest son...  Womp, womp, womp.  Womp, womp, womp.  Was born out of wedlock.  Uh-oh.  And his name is Sam.  And apparently he was born out of wedlock.  That was her first son.  And just scroll down.  Is he queer like ours?  Yes.  And he works for a coroner.  It's really weird.  You don't even have a father, Sam.  I'm not doing a bit on it.  You're right.  So when it was brought up in the documentary by the reporter, it stopped them a little bit. 
[01:08:00]  And again, they're hard.  Nothing you say gets to them.  Right.  Call them cunts.  It means literally.  It's like flicking.  It means nothing.  But because this is real.  Uh-huh.  And because it's undeniable.  And you know that it had been kept a secret for all these years.  And it's so fucking hypocritical of them.  It's amazing how they don't want that.  And again, I'm sure they've learned how to handle it publicly.  But I don't know it. 
[01:08:30]  I guarantee it annoys her.  How angry are they at her?  That everybody knows her first son is illegitimate.  He's a bastard.  Your first son is a bastard son.  And they, their first child, have no father.  If you're going to go after everyone like they do, you should be perfect, right?  Well, that's the fucking monkey wrench thrown into their works.  Well, the guy will find it.  The video is very short.  Oh, I want to see it.  It's right down there with the guy smiling.  And they're not expecting it. 
[01:09:00]  Oh.  This is in their house.  He gave me the choice.  No, he hardened your heart.  No, he didn't.  He gave me the choice.  And you have as much choice.  You are as free as a frog in a snake's belly.  God gave me the choice, baby.  You have no choice.  You think you do.  And it's because of your pride and arrogance that the destruction will come.  I know I have choice.  You've got the choice.  Why did you come to the tacky bourgeois middle class?  No, hang on.  Stop there.  This is very simple.  You're being very childish.  I did not say this.  I didn't say this was tacky.  You said this?  I didn't say this.  Okay.  What's your name?  Sam. 
[01:09:30]  Sam.  Well, they're uncle and nephew.  Sam.  And they seem to have come from the same.  Are you the image of Samoa?  That's it.  That is my bombshell.  I'll fast forward a little bit through him talking.  The real bastard is in this.  Real bastard.  No, no, no.  Back a little bit.  The high ground.  Yeah, there you go.  Okay.  It's a radio show he's talking about happening.  Uh-huh.  So, welcome back to Hypocrisy Corner.  As your presenter with eight children, several divorces, and a history of serial adultery takes  the moral high ground.  Sam.  Uncle and nephew. 
[01:10:00]  Sam.  And they seem to have come from the same.  Are you the image of Samoa?  What does that mean?  Cross, are you thick?  Do you know what illegitimate means?  Am I thick?  Yeah, but were you born outside of marriage?  Were you?  That's none of your business.  Were you?  Oh, it's none of my business now.  Are you asking your child?  Hang on, God works in really mysterious ways here.  Ask me.  I'm his mom.  I'm asking you.  Hey, I'm the mom.  I birthed you.  So you are his mom?  I am his mom.  Of course it is my mom.  You're the illegitimate son.  Are you asking me?  Are you asking me?  Give me something. 
[01:10:30]  If this child was born?  Give me something.  I've stopped you in your tracksuit.  Yes.  No, you haven't stopped nothing.  Give me something.  Answer you.  Answer me.  She's trying to ask her.  Is he the illegitimate son?  Listen, listen.  He's my son.  Is he the illegitimate son?  Yes.  Are you going to hell?  If the Lord Jesus Christ did not die on that cross for me, for my sins, I am going to hell.  Are you going to hell because you had a son outside of wedlock?  Look, that would not be the reason.  Why not? 
[01:11:00]  Because you've atoned?  No, I can't possibly atone.  I just told you that if the Lord Jesus Christ did not die on that cross for my sins to pay that price, I will go to hell with the rest of us.  Well, then what about everybody else?  You've got it covered, please.  Do you see?  I love the part where she goes, it's none of your business.  Really?  You're getting in everyone else's business.  But did you see that?  That got her.  And the son goes, that's none of your business.  And she stepped, physically you can't see it, she stepped in front of him to protect him from this, I'm the mother, ask me, I'm the mother. 
[01:11:30]  That is as close as you will ever come to seeing anybody in that family rattled, and they were rattled.  Definitely rattled.  And they had just said, yeah, we've talked about that.  She stepped in front of him.  And believe me, this fucking lump of a fucking illegitimate embarrassment being attacked on Twitter, and that being shoved in her face, and the whole country knowing that she has a fucking illegitimate fuck.  Yeah.  And her husband, Brent Roper, adopted this kid, I guess, when he was young. 
[01:12:00]  And she will not say who the father is.  And I believe, what I've heard, estranged family members, and I'm hearing this third person, have said that it was from a halfway house when she was in college, she did her internship in.  Oh, man.  And apparently, and again, the story is that she fucked somebody, I'm assuming.  So that's as much as I know about it.  But that's why I've been attacking this fucking illegitimate bastard, this embarrassment to that family.  Oh, total embarrassment.  Go after every single one of them on Twitter and just talk about this fucking, this lump, this fucking lump. 
[01:12:30]  Because there's no way they like that.  There's no way they're not very bothered by that Achilles heel.  You see her stop and do that fake laugh?  Are you asking me?  Oh, yeah.  Are you asking?  That was a nervous little titter, wasn't it?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's her monkey wrench.  That's her fucking monkey wrench.  There's nothing wrong with having illegitimate children.  But if you're in her position, you've got to be kind of squeaky clean, and that's why it drives her nuts. 
[01:13:00]  Were you born outside of wedlock?  Ask me.  Ask the way they were avoiding it.  Ask me.  And she had to answer it.  Yes.  Fucking.  Any more to the clip?  I see there's not much left.  Just play it out.  What more answer?  You can't answer for yourself.  I told you.  You tell me what it changes.  You're going to appreciate your hypocrite.  You're a critical fool.  You're going to appreciate this, because I get paid for this.  And you think this allowing you talk, and the more spit that flies out of your mouth, you can change God.  So they go right back to God.  Yeah.  But that big boy had to stand behind Mommy. 
[01:13:30]  Big boy Sam had to stand behind Mommy and let her answer the question.  Ah, Sam Roberts, too.  I don't know what kind of tangible support you can offer at a time like this, but chances are they're going to need a lot of help.  Yeah, I mean, there's a feeling of helplessness a little bit.  I mean, I was on the ground.  That there was a reluctance to tell parents and loved ones that the person that they were waiting for was not going to return.  Oh, a little damn away getting a little choked up, huh? 
[01:14:00]  And to have that go on any longer was wrong.  Six-year-old Noah Posner was laid to rest yesterday.  Thank you.  I don't mind them focusing on the victims as much.  No, of course not.  But I know what their motive is.  I think it's because the public in general is getting to them.  So they've added this little twist to it. 
[01:14:30]  They're going to start for another couple weeks when the lights go away  and the busyness of the dealing with the grief ends.  So we're going to need to make sure that we have everything we need in the long run.  Right now, I think we can safely say that Newtown has what it needs.  Senator-elect Chris Murphy, we know you have to go.  Thank you very much.  Oh, you got the Jim Norton tweets.  Norton!  They're really just, you know. 
[01:15:00]  All right, well, I get embarrassed about my tweets.  Aw!  Poor Jimmy.  They were mean spirits.  They were people who are digging.  Mean-spirited.  I just like the ones where you said spread her legs.  That was good.  It was hot, too.  Yeah.  Dirty Shirley.  Dirty.  Dirty Shirley.  Big pussy.  Just go after them on Twitter.  Just fucking have fun with them.  I like telling them that their father failed.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Add to your Shirley.  I gave you a two-shot. 
[01:15:30]  Wow.  We have a sign that says,  God hates whores who take cum before marriage.  I love that.  Holy fuck.  There's some solid ones in there.  Go to Jim Norton on Twitter.  Yeah, there's a...  Check them out for yourself.  Oh, yeah.  It's great to fucking...  Holy shit.  It's a great little read.  Yeah.  Jimmy's so mean.  Yeah.  I'm going to hit her again today,  but she's not, you know...  But she's probably checking her out mentions. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, I bet.  Because they're active on Twitter.  They respond.  Although, they don't respond to questions  about that fucking bastard.  They don't respond to questions about Sam.  So, I would suggest to everybody...  Ask Sam.  You can see who they are.  Fred Phelps Jr.  And Dear Shirley.  And Margie J. Phelps.  I would just continue to barrage them  with questions until they answer.  Because I'm curious.  And maybe they just haven't seen the tweets yet.  So, they're probably very busy lately.  Yeah.  Preparing to protest.  Sure.  Dead children's funerals.  Right.  Under the guise of, you know,  sticking America's face in it. 
[01:16:30]  And I did take one tweet down  because you have to be careful what you say.  But I was alluding to the fact  that I think that they should use  their First Amendment.  They have the right to use the First Amendment.  And if they do,  I hope somebody uses the Second Amendment  to shut them up.  Yeah.  But I could tell that people were immediately going,  you know, you shouldn't advocate violence.  So, I just took it down.  Just like, that's not what I'm saying.  It's just what I hope happens.  I wouldn't advocate it.  I can hope, can't I?  You can hope.  You're allowed to hope.  Sure.  I can hope that bad things happen.  Of course.  They're horrible people. 
[01:17:00]  Terrible.  Good.  How do they, like, it's such a,  it's almost hackish.  It's like a hacky thing.  Like, oh, we get it.  You're so outrageous.  Oh, look at what you're going to do.  Are they all talk, though?  Or are they up there?  Oh, they go.  They don't go to gang members' funerals, though.  You don't see them protesting  for the, the, the, the Crips  or the Bloods  or the, you know,  the gangster disciples.  And, uh, hey, look,  a lot of them are involved in drugs  or the Latin Kings. 
[01:17:30]  When's the last time you saw them  come up and protest  the Latin King funeral?  Right.  In the South Bronx  or in fucking Brooklyn?  Yeah, those guys aren't going to  put up with that shit.  Of course they're not.  There would be a massive drive-by.  They would literally run  through the police barricade,  gang members,  and fucking,  we're in South Central Los Angeles.  There's always godless gang members  doing stuff.  Why doesn't Westboro show up there?  Yeah, there you go.  Good point.  So I love Anonymous  giving out all their information.  Good for Anonymous.  Um, you know,  it's just,  they're just disgusting people,  these, these,  and I hope they're declared  a hate group.  And I, and I feel weird 
[01:18:00]  saying that because it's like,  as much as I hate them,  free speech is a fucking...  I said it yesterday.  It does make you question  the First Amendment.  That is kind of odd.  Just a little bit.  Like, like,  because you wouldn't want  to just be able to  use a loophole  or a technicality  to make someone  a hate group  just so you can then...  Shut them up.  Shut them up.  Um, but I do believe  what they are doing is,  constitutes a hate group.  I mean,  what constitutes a hate group? 
[01:18:30]  Like,  they're saying awful things  and wishing death on people,  and...  What are some of the  official hate groups out there?  Well, you got yourself  your Ku Klux Klan.  Got the KKK.  Uh, you got yourself  your Aryan Nation.  Do you have to be associated  with violence?  Hmm, I'm not sure.  Or acts of violence?  I'm not sure.  Because they don't encourage  acts of...  As far as I know,  they never encourage people  to injure other people.  They just want God  to damn them.  Yeah.  And they don't commit  violent acts. 
[01:19:00]  They're all lawyers.  They're smart.  They got terrific markers, though.  They really do.  They really are some  fucking good sign-making  motherfuckers.  Very colorful.  Yeah, they are colorful signs.  They're terrific.  Not the words on them, but...  If they made children's  birthday party signs,  they'd fucking be living  in a mansion.  God loves balloons.  Changing gears slightly  for just a minute.  We do have Joe Rogan  calling in a little bit here.  Oh, good.  I think the Jets' season 
[01:19:30]  is finally over.  That's it, huh?  Thank goodness, I'll say.  Thank goodness.  Yeah.  Mark Sanchez proving  once again  that he's a shitty quarterback.  And at this point,  I question that  if he even deserves  to be in the NFL.  And the Jets got to pay him,  I think,  how many million next year?  Something like eight  or something?  We're stuck with this fucking guy.  He's a fucking bum.  He went out in a great fashion.  I know we've had injuries  and all that this year,  but last night 
[01:20:00]  against a, I believe,  5-9 team,  or they're now 5-9,  Tennessee,  good old Sanchez  had four interceptions.  Oh, God, he sucks.  And then they still  had a chance  to win the game  because they fucked up a punt,  so they get the ball back  with 40 seconds left.  They're pretty close.  You know,  they got a real shot  and this asshole  fumbles it. 
[01:20:30]  He fumbles to snap.  So there you go, Rex Ryan.  You turned pretty much  all Jet fans against you.  They should both be  fucking booted.  For believing this  fucking asshole.  Was Tebow the answer?  I don't know.  Maybe that other guy,  the third stringer,  but you just keep going  back to Sanchez.  Why would he do that?  And he's proven  time and time again  he's not getting  the job done.  They bring the third  stringer guy in  and I barely know his name.  He's making the same mistakes. 
[01:21:00]  And he marched down the field  and he won for the Jets.  Yeah.  So what happens to that guy?  He's benched again.  For one of the games  he wasn't even dressed.  And Rex Ryan  went right back to Sanchez  time and time again.  Hmm.  I'm fucking real.  Four interceptions  and a fumble  when it mattered most.  Not even giving your team  a chance  to score at the end there.  The first fucking play  after that punt.  That shitty punt. 
[01:21:30]  They, uh...  Fuck!  The sign from Westboro  God sent the shooter,  they're saying.  Yeah.  But they say now  to picket the funeral  of Sandy Hook  Elementary School  Principal  Dawn  Hutchsprung.  Uh-huh.  So for some reason  uh...  They are protesting.  They're saying they're going...  Maybe they're going to do kids too  but it looks like they're...  From this thing  it says they're protesting  the principals.  Oh, that's good.  Why?  Maybe I'm guessing  they couldn't get a permit  for the other ones maybe.  Because you have to give  permits for this shit  but I'm wondering 
[01:22:00]  if the town just said sue us.  Yeah, yeah, right.  You're not getting a permit, sue us.  What did the principal do wrong?  She tried to do something  and she lost her life  and that...  And why is that a problem  with Jesus?  Yeah, why do they protest?  What is that?  Well, they're saying  that God sends these shooters  it's a good thing  they love dead cops  dead soldiers  because, of course  their homosexual obsession  they're saying  that God is punishing  the country for fag marriage.  It's like child's lingo.  But what about  the illegitimate kid? 
[01:22:30]  Um, I don't know  if God is punishing that  I would love to  and I asked her on Twitter too  like I wonder  who was a better fuck  like did she come harder  out of marriage or in?  And I wonder if her husband  ever thinks of that.  Oh, that's great.  I wonder if that  cuckold husband of hers  ever wonders  who had a bigger dick.  Of course.  Yeah, maybe they're  maybe they're actually  worried about  what will happen  if they protest  the children's funerals.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, we should break  it ready for Joe Rogan. 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  I see that  Tchaikovsky's  Tchaikovsky's  Nutcracker Suite  premiered in Russia  120 years ago today.  Tchaikovsky?  I don't know.  Don't we have  our Nutcracker Suite?  That's the only reason  why I'm bringing this up.  You're out.  Let me know if you find it.  We can play that  and it's a break.  You don't care  about the football, huh?  Not really.  I mean, the clips  were hilarious.  Watching fucking  Sanchez throw 
[01:23:30]  interception after  interception and then  fucking fumble.  Bad interceptions too.  Yeah.  Every once in a while  there's one where you're like  holy fuck, that was  an amazing play  but these were bad  interceptions.  Yeah.  Most of them.  And then fumbling  a snap.  Yeah.  When you have one  really good shot  at winning the game.  I'm not a Jet fan  and I get angry  for their fans.  Like, I hate that  Sanchez so much  watching that.  Like, you fucking  bum.  He's a bum.  He really is.  I hate the organization.  Like, why would they  once again 
[01:24:00]  Richard Todd  can they make  one winning pick?  Well, the organization's  all fucked up  because it's pretty obvious  no one really wanted  Tebow.  Woody Johnson wanted  Tebow, the owner.  And he got his way.  He thought it would be  great, you know,  marketing for the team.  So then Rex Ryan's like,  fuck that.  I ain't using this  fucking guy.  I don't want him  on my team.  I just kept going  to, you know,  Sanchez.  You find it, he rocked.  All right.  So in honor of  the Nutcracker Suite  premiering 120 years ago. 
[01:24:30]  120 years ago.  Just an excuse  to play this dumb thing  we did back in the day,  back in the day.  In the day.  Two guys getting kicked  hard,  right in the crotch  with no protection.  All right.  I guess he's ready  to be kicked.  He's ready to be kicked.  Oh, no.  This is just wrong, man.  Oh, how did this  degenerate into this?  He is on his knees.  He is chained  to the bottom of the chair.  His stuff, 
[01:25:00]  as it would be,  is a little too prominent  in those bikini panties.  Girl panties.  He put on his sister's,  his little sister's  panties today.  Isn't that cute?  She's putting a thing  in his mouth  to bite on.  Panties.  Oh, panties.  Oh, I didn't know.  Oh, those are your panties?  Spike.  Yeah.  She's got the whip, too.  She's bending his head back,  straddling him,  and she's whipping his body, 
[01:25:30]  his tummy,  and lower region.  That's got to hurt.  That has got to hurt.  Oh!  That got him.  Oh, that got him.  That got him.  That got him.  That got him.  Look, he almost fell down.  If he wasn't chained up,  he would have fallen down.  That's why he's chained up.  Spike is comforting him now.  Did you see him flinch?  And he hasn't been kicked yet.  That was just the whip.  He's lining up. 
[01:26:00]  Oh!  He's just kicking him.  Oh!  Oh, he just buckled over.  He just doubled over in pain.  He's breathing really heavy.  I have never seen anything like this.  She's lining up again.  Oh!  Oh, he's flinching.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  All right, Paul is still on his knees, 
[01:26:30]  and Ellen's going to start kicking now.  She's been done wrong by a lot of guys.  Here she goes.  She's lining up.  Oh!  Paul goes, you didn't even make me flinch.  And then she kicked him.  And then she went for it.  He's flinching now at the drop of a hat.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, that was a good one.  That, he almost fell over.  Oh, look, look.  He's ready to woof, I think.  You all right, Paul?  Oh, yeah.  Oh. 
[01:27:00]  I just hope I get a seat on the subway.  Are we ready for contestant number two?  I'm a little scared.  I'm ready.  All right, I guess we're ready for more of this.  I would miss this for the world.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm going to need some water suit.  I'm going to need some water suit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:27:30]  This is not right.  Spike knows she hit too hard.  Mother of God.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Oh.  I can't take any more eyes.  That was a bad one. 
[01:28:00]  I can't take this anymore.  I saw a flash.  Was that me or the camera?  He's seeing light.  I got a shot of that on the video. 
[01:28:30]  That will make you cringe.  All right, let's see if we can't get a good kick in from Grandma.  Grandma is lining up.  She just gave him three quick shots.  She gave him three quickies.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  Grandma gave him three.  All right, hold on, Grandma.  How are you holding up?  I'm not.  I'm a Grandma.  Grandma's pretty good.  You missed, Grandma.  Listen.  Oh!  He's down!  He's down!  He's down!  He's down!  You don't turn Grandma like that.  Come on!  Grandma's a good shot.  Oh, yeah!  She got the bullseye.  Grandma still got a chance, right?  Let's hear it for Grandma. 
[01:29:30]  Grandma, put him down.  God, did she line up and kick him.  Someone's got to put a stop to this.  This is just not right.  It's really not right.  We must say, because we have a lot of ladies that listen to us.  Yeah.  Ladies, not all guys enjoy this.  It's a proof of masculinity.  Oh, sure it is.  A man?  A man?  Well, then call me a pussy.  I found my limit.  I know you say that we're some sick motherfuckers. 
[01:30:00]  Because we're as cold as the Ice Road Truckers.  And when we come to your town, the shit goes down.  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:31:00]  That's great news.  It is good news.  We could say that much, right?  Yeah.  The NBC journalist was released.  Richard Engels, right?  From Syria.  Yeah, man.  He's a rock star reporter.  He goes to these crazy-ass areas, and he was kidnapped, I guess.  And a lot of people are thinking this isn't going to turn out well,  but I guess he was released this morning by his captors. 
[01:31:30]  I was talking to my—okay, I wasn't going to talk about it on the air,  but I mentioned it in the break.  I'm like, because Jonathan asked me not to.  He's friends with the guy.  He goes, yeah, my friend.  You know this guy.  If you Google his name, you've seen him a million times.  He's a reporter.  He's got fucking balls.  Wait, is he still released?  Are you sure he's released?  That's what Travis, our international desk.  Yeah, that's from our international desk.  Yeah.  Okay, he's free.  But John's friends with him.  He's like, yeah, my friend is being held captive.  Like, I didn't know who this guy was.  Jonathan, the guy that travels the world to all those crazy places 
[01:32:00]  and thinks nothing could possibly ever happen to him.  That guy?  Yeah.  Where he tells his stories, and we sit here like,  holy fuck, what's wrong with you?  Yeah, what are you doing, John?  But there was a media blackout on this guy being taken,  because that's how they got the Times reporter released, too.  NBC was requesting people black it out.  And, you know, people did, except for Gawker, of course,  because they're fucking just shit.  But I feel like I'm glad that they did it.  It was responsible.  But when the media wants to black something out for one of their own, they do. 
[01:32:30]  They absolutely do.  For the rest of us, our common good is not as important.  Nah.  Let's say hi to Joe Rogan.  Joe, are you?  Hello.  Hi, Joe.  Joe.  Morning, boys.  Did you stay up just to talk to us, or did you get some sleep?  Um, I stayed up.  Nice.  Yeah, I really don't usually go to bed before four anyway, so.  Yeah.  Night owl, as they like to say, right?  Yeah, it's a night owl.  Hey, highly intelligent person on the phone,  I want your quick take on the whole Newtown thing, man. 
[01:33:00]  Well, you know, obviously it's horrific and disgusting and scary,  but the big question that I want to know is what kind of medication was this kid on?  Yeah.  I think that's a big factor in a lot of these.  It was a big factor in Columbine, and I think it's a big factor in a lot of these terrifying situations.  I think there's a lot of kids that are raised in this country on meds, 
[01:33:30]  and we don't really know the full impact of these things.  We also don't know what was wrong with him, what his home life was.  It's a horrifying fucking situation, you know, obviously.  Mm-hmm.  And it's also incredibly tragic.  There's nothing we could do once it's over that can make anybody feel any better,  and everybody's scrambling for gun control,  and everybody's scrambling to, you know,  to figure out how to take assault weapons out of the picture. 
[01:34:00]  You know, I don't know what the fuck.  I don't think that, and I honestly don't think that's a solution.  I mean, people are going to get their hands on these things and do bad things.  And, you know, short of arming somebody in a school,  I think protecting the kids, putting some kind of barrier between the kids and any shooter,  much like in a bank, you know,  there really isn't much you can do to try to keep these things out of bad and sick people's hands. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, yeah, the argument is that if he didn't have assault weapons,  he wouldn't be able to do this as easy.  And I kind of see that argument.  Sure.  And also there's another argument that a lot of people don't want to consider,  but if this was a well-armed area, this guy would not have done that.  Right.  They don't do this.  They don't go to military bases fully armed like this.  They go places where they know it's going to have an impact,  people are going to be horrified, 
[01:35:00]  and they're going to be able to do it without the kind of resistance that they would get  if they went worse people are armed.  Joe, you're a dad.  Would you feel more comfortable with the guns gone,  or your daughter's going to school where there was somebody who's kind of, you know,  a guard or something?  What would make you feel more comfortable?  Well, the guns gone is unrealistic.  It's like trying to take pee out of the ocean.  At this point in time,  how the fuck are you going to get rid of all the guns?  I mean, there's a lot of guns just at Anthony's house.  Talk about the rest of the fucking country. 
[01:35:30]  Yes.  You know, and this guy, by the way,  he violated a fuckload of laws before he ever even left the house.  Exactly.  They were his mother's guns,  and, you know, they should have been,  for sure they should have been locked up in some sort of a safe.  You know, I'm all for responsible gun ownership,  but it's like, Timothy McVeigh killed a fuckload of people with a bunch of fertilizer and a truck.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, if people want to kill people, they can kill people.  They can get away with it in a bunch of different ways. 
[01:36:00]  It's that, the mindset to kill strangers just to be able to make the news,  just to be able to make an impact.  Right.  That's what's fucked up.  People love asking, like, why is the United States different than France and Germany and England  as far as these shootings go and these killings?  We have this FASA-fucking-nation with celebrity in this country.  We love, everyone wants to be famous. 
[01:36:30]  And for a twisted individual, this is the way to do it.  If you know you're going to be checking out,  the best way to do it before you go to become famous is by doing this.  We're fascinated with celebrity.  It's more powerful than video games, than the availability of assault weapons.  And I truly believe that's the difference between America and these other countries.  And, Joe, I ask you, we were talking about this yesterday.  When we were all growing up, we were all relatively the same age. 
[01:37:00]  You had these weird kids like this, these loners and whatnot,  and they would just go in their basement and hang themselves.  Or, you know, they would step in front of a train.  What has changed, do you think, where now they want to go out in a blaze of glory?  I think meds have a lot to do with it.  I think that's the untold.  Look, I lost a good friend, Phil Hartman, because his wife was on cocaine and Zoloft.  You know, I think there's something happening where we're engineering the consciousness of our citizens 
[01:37:30]  in a way that I don't think is really completely understood, especially for children.  And they do it, like, really easily.  I have a neighbor.  They've since moved out.  But these people, their kids, they were normal kids, man.  There was nothing fucked up about their kids.  But they had these kids on Lidlund because they just didn't want to deal.  And who knows what the fuck that's doing?  I don't know what that would happen.  I think kids are supposed to grow into their own. 
[01:38:00]  I mean, when I was in school, obviously you had the weirdo and the fucking guy that was a little too rambunctious  and maybe the kid that fell asleep in class.  But I think it's part of what develops into your personality.  You grow into it.  You make relationships and change.  This fascination with just drugging these kids to try to get them to assimilate to what we think they're supposed to be at that age is ridiculous. 
[01:38:30]  Instead of just the natural progression of growing, they figured just load them up with drugs and it fucks these kids up.  I like Joe Rogan's take on it because we're all focusing on the guns.  But, I mean, legal drugs in this country is completely out of control.  And that's obviously a huge business, so we're never going to focus on that and try to figure out what we can do there, right?  Well, psychotic episodes are a real issue in this country.  And when you have drugs that have been known to cause psychotic episodes, like a lot of these SSRIs, 
[01:39:00]  when they mix them with other things like cocaine or whatever, they've been known to cause these episodes.  And then, you know, there's also the issue of parenting.  What the fucking horrific environment did this poor kid grow up in that turned him into this monster?  I mean, you know, a lot of people don't like someone saying poor kid when it comes to a mass murderer.  But as a father, I know that every fucking human being that was walking around today used to be a baby.  That's how I see them.  You know, what the fuck happened that turned a cute little baby into a monster? 
[01:39:30]  Some people are just bad, I think.  Like, I know it sounds like a really cheap answer, but I think sometimes with mental illness, like, the meds do, I think, fuck a lot of people up.  But I think there's also the odds if you didn't medicate them, like, how many people have gone on tremendous sprees because they weren't medicated?  It's almost like you're damned if you're—I hate to say that, but, you know—  Them don't.  Yeah.  No, you're right.  Aunt Jim almost made a point.  Aunt Jim.  They wanted to put me on Riddler when I was a kid. 
[01:40:00]  Really?  Yeah.  My mother said no.  Look, he's on Viagra.  If you had a mother said yes, we would have lost a comedian, probably.  Yeah.  Yes.  I lost a loon.  Or you would have gained a man who could keep an erection in a relationship and wouldn't need comedy.  You would probably have a harder time.  I mean, doesn't those meds, like, kill boners?  Oh, they probably do, yeah.  But then again, they would have given self-esteem, which is my biggest erection killer.  I don't think they would give you self-esteem.  I think they give you a numbness.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think what they're doing is they mask the pain that a lot of people experience. 
[01:40:30]  I don't know.  Well, I'm talking out of my ass because I haven't had him, and I'm not, but there's  a lot of issues.  It's not nearly as simple as everybody wants to say.  Like, all these fucking liberals just running around, gun control, gun control.  Look, there's a lot of people with guns that aren't doing this.  That's not the issue.  It's not the answer, either.  It truly isn't.  I want to stay on the drug thing for two more seconds.  My mom has been on a shitload of drugs my entire life.  A couple things happened.  When she went on a new drug, sometimes the look in her face was downright frightening. 
[01:41:00]  Really?  It's scary.  And then there was the other part of it where she obviously has mental issues, and I went  to a lot of these appointments with her, and I watched the psychiatrist just write script  after script because he doesn't know what the fuck to do.  So I actually have heard guys go, I don't know, try this, this, and this, and just hand  them out like they're fucking playing cards.  Yeah, well, it's a real inexact science, and I have a good friend that was on a bunch  of different ones before they found one that worked for them. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  Yeah, but this...  Yeah, they just try it until something might stick.  It is a trial and error thing, yeah.  In my mom's case, she pretty much slept a decade.  Jesus.  She slept a decade.  She didn't, uh, who knows, but if it...  Sounds relaxing, though.  Well, but if it's someone else, you're on the wrong combination of shit.  Who knows what you're capable of doing?  Yeah, it's the inexact...  I kind of agree with Joe.  Joe, the inexact nature of it is really scary, and the long-term repercussions of it are really  scary, and also, by the way, uh, if the fucking... something goes wrong, and you can't get your 
[01:42:00]  shit for a couple months, you're probably gonna go crazy.  Yeah.  Imagine that, Joe, like some type of real, uh, catastrophe in this country where the drugs  can't make their way to the people that need them, and just an entire nation of people off  their meds.  Oh.  Having psychotic episodes.  Holy fuck!  That's a zombie invasion.  Just another thing to look at as far as this whole school shooting goes.  Have you ever looked at just how many people need Ambien to go to sleep? 
[01:42:30]  Yes.  Oh, they hand that out like it's...  Yeah.  Tic-tacs.  Dude, 39 million people in this country...  Is it really?  ...that are regular users of Ambien.  Wow.  Wouldn't that be over a tenth of our nation?  Yep.  That's crazy.  We got about 330 million?  You know, I have a story that I've been telling on stage that's a true story.  When I was in San Francisco, I think it was about a year and a half ago, I was involved  in a fire.  There'd be... 
[01:43:00]  It turned out to not be a fire.  It turned out to be these assholes just blew off fire extinguishers.  But it was 4.30 in the morning, and we got woken up to an alarm, like, saying that the hotel  was on fire.  And I had a, you know, run out of there.  And as I was hitting the hallway, I run into all these sleepy people that are trying to make  their way downstairs, and you'd be fucking amazed at how many of these people were clearly  on some concert.  Holy shit.  Fucking zombies, because there's hundreds of people in this hotel. 
[01:43:30]  They're all cramming into a single-file staircase to slowly...  And people were literally waking up as they were on the staircase, not, like, holding onto  the rails going, what's going on?  Where are we?  What are we doing?  Like, didn't know what the fuck was happening while it was happening.  You know, I've changed my opinion.  I think having a lot of these people medicated is a good thing.  Dude, it's just...  You honestly...  You're right.  We're kind of changing the psyche of the country with prescription drugs. 
[01:44:00]  And there's obviously too many people using them that probably really don't need them.  And just like guns, that's not going to stop anytime soon.  There are drug stores going up on every corner in Manhattan.  It's definitely an issue.  And, you know, the root of that, mental health is obviously an issue, too.  A lot of people, their lives are shit.  They fucking...  They fucking...  They hate their lives.  They hate their existence.  They hate their job.  They hate their wife.  They hate where they live. 
[01:44:30]  They hate everything.  And they're numbing themselves with medication.  You know, we have...  We've got a real problem in this country in that respect.  There's a lot of disenfranchised motherfuckers that are running around essentially crazy.  I just figured it out in my head quickly.  I live in Manhattan.  Within two blocks, there's five drugstores.  Yeah.  No joke.  The medical industry is amazingly wealthy.  But you know what?  On the flip side, it's helped a lot of people. 
[01:45:00]  The medication has kept a lot of people alive.  There's a lot of people...  I have friends that have gotten on these antidepressants, and it's saved their life.  And it helped them out.  You see it change, right?  Yeah.  They were suicidal.  A good buddy of mine was telling me he was suicidal.  I got him to a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist got him on drugs.  And now he's the happiest motherfucker alive.  It's a weird thing.  Because I don't think there's any one correct answer for the entire population.  It's just, we're doing a lot of experimental shit. 
[01:45:30]  And, you know...  Trying to figure it out.  Yeah.  And in doing so, it's really dangerous.  We know for a fact that the Columbine killers were on antidepressants.  They know for a fact that we're doing that.  And they were also doing drugs on top of it, which causes psychotic episodes.  You know, the truth doesn't come out about this kid.  I didn't want to say his fucking name.  I appreciate that you guys haven't been saying his name.  But whatever made this monster, whatever turned this baby into a 20-year-old person that's  capable of doing something like that, it's a real societal issue.  And it's not going to be fixed by guns being not available. 
[01:46:00]  Because, yeah, it would have made it a lot harder.  But the same day, a fucking guy in China ran into a school and stabbed 20 kids.  Yeah.  And, you know, yes, those kids lived.  You know, yes, those kids are alive because he didn't have the same access to guns.  That's a real argument, too.  But I have guns.  I wouldn't do that.  The fact that somebody would actually run into a school and stabbed people is the issue.  It's the problem.  How the fuck does anybody turn into that person?  That's the real issue.  I would love to disagree with you and Anthony on the gun thing. 
[01:46:30]  But I really think you guys are right.  I really do.  Look, if we had Navy SEALs armed outside that school just standing there.  You know, waving everybody in, none of this would have ever happened.  And that's reality.  I'm not saying that we need fucking armed guards everywhere because, you know, then you're  also leaving things up to the judgment of other human beings.  And they could be fucking wackadoos, too.  Who knows?  Yeah.  We're just going to blindly trust those people.  It's really a complicated issue. 
[01:47:00]  It's very complicated.  But we do have armed guards at Walmart, so thank God.  Thank God.  Yeah, but how motivated are they to stay alive?  You know, they might just fucking rush right into the bullets.  One of our regulars, Matt in Connecticut, says you have a good take on autism and Asperger's.  Well, I don't necessarily know if I have a good take on it, but I think that there's a bunch  of factors when it comes to that stuff as well, you know, and one of them might be that it's  the next stage of human evolution. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, we're looking at human beings the way they are now as if this is the only way.  This is the way people are going to be forever, and that's crazy.  I mean, we know that we used to be different.  We know that we used to be lower hominids, and there's a bunch of whole theories of how,  you know, our brain doubled over a period of two million years.  But if you look at all these environmental factors and you looked at these really strange  aberrations in human behavior and abilities and try to figure out what the fuck is going on, 
[01:48:00]  one of the possibilities might be that we're watching these changes in human beings that  actually led to us being human in the first place.  Like, when a kid can look out a window and see an entire skyline and then draw it exactly  off of memory, what the fuck is going on there?  And then when you find out that that kid has Asperger's, or how do you think they're using  the term Asperger's anymore?  I think it's autism spectrum.  I think there's like some, among some circles or something.  Yeah, they say you're on the spectrum. 
[01:48:30]  That kid is on the spectrum.  Is that a politically correct term or just more accurate?  Probably.  I am not going to sit here and have you tell me Bobo is further evolved than all of us.  Yeah, exactly.  I think what we're dealing with is subtle changes in the way the human mind works.  I mean, when some kid can be like nine years old and compose a hundred symphonies before  his 10th birthday, you got to go, what the fuck is happening here?  This kid can't even talk to strangers.  He can't have a conversation with people. 
[01:49:00]  He can't look you in the eye, but yet he's got these incredible abilities.  And a lot of people are also thinking that it's a move away from emotions, that the emotions  that have led us to have these, like a lot of what gives us emotions or a lot of the reasons  why we have emotions is so that we have this sense of unity and community and we feel for  each other and we want to be connected to each other and all these different things that  are a part of human culture. 
[01:49:30]  Well, as we like get more and more into technology and separate from people more and more, the  argument is that we're slowly going to remove the need for emotions.  We're slowly going to remove the need for being human.  When we start getting into symbiotic relationships with computers and with technology, the point  where people are talking about, you know, having neural interfaces where you have a chip  in your fucking brain that's going to allow you to get information directly from Wi-Fi, 
[01:50:00]  no computer necessary.  How long before you stop being a person?  What happens in there where you become some new organism that doesn't have the same sort  of emotions that have led us to have these tribal relationships?  I've actually been saying that for a while about sense of humor.  Like, uh, I think X amount of like, like, I also think that the idea of country and individuality  will someday be seen as, as primitive qualities, like a sense of humor.  Most people have, cause you need it.  It's a, it serves a need.  It gets you love or get you approval, but eventually you'll get those things. 
[01:50:30]  Once we know chemically and have mapped DNA and 500 years from now, when all that stuff  is just a plus B equals C, there'll be no need to get those things.  So a sense of humor won't be a needed thing, just like full body hair is no longer a needed  thing or a fucking tail is no longer a needed thing.  Well, no one told Joe Rogan that, but he's the last one with body hair.  Joe's a weird combination of a modern day brain with fucking knuckles, with knuckles from 
[01:51:00]  200,000 BC.  Well, that was my problem as a young boy.  I was too much Neanderthal.  Yeah.  Everybody, everybody's got the one thing that makes them not fit in.  I'm too much monkey.  But I, I do, I, I totally agree with you.  That's eventually going to go away.  Not that we're going to, I don't even think it's a bad thing.  I just think that what the need that it suffices will be taken care of either by genetic engineering  or by, uh, just weeding out all those qualities, like the, the qualities that make us insecure. 
[01:51:30]  And eventually we just won't need that shit.  It will be focused on other things.  I think you're right.  And I think you're absolutely right about a sense of humor.  I mean, essentially what you and I do for a living is because human interaction is so  fucked up because we both grew up insecure or whatever the fuck, you know, I mean, all  of you guys, everyone on this show, you're the whole reason you, you, you have a job is  because there's this issue in society where people can't speak freely. 
[01:52:00]  So you guys have these voices and people are in the car.  They go, fuck yeah.  Yeah, they're right.  What the fuck is going on?  And they don't get these kinds of conversations anywhere else because of this imbalance in  society.  And one day that won't exist anymore.  When we can all read each other's minds, how much humor will exist?  I mean, when you know what people are doing long before they do it, these, these are all  like real possibilities of, as far as like the future of human interactions.  Like we might be, uh, like a fucking appendix of the mind, something that's no longer necessary 
[01:52:30]  one day.  Hey, uh, Joe, uh, I, I, I need your take on Alex Jones.  Cause I know, I know you're, I know you're a fan of his and, and we feel, I personally  feel like I like, I like 15 to 20% of what he says.  And I think the problem is the 80% makes them look like a whack job.  Yeah.  Well, you're right.  Yeah.  It's about that.  Okay.  Cause I, I was just an awesome Texas.  I hung out with him, he allegedly smoked pot with me. 
[01:53:00]  He's a fucking good dude.  When you're just hanging out with him.  The problem is he's crazy doom and gloom on that show.  Yes.  That's his business.  And everybody that's calling up is like fucking talking about everything's a false flag.  He sees conspiracies around every corner.  Everything.  Nothing can just happen.  Everything's got to be a conspiracy, but that said, the motherfucker uncovers a lot  of shit that turns out to be real.  Right.  There's a lot of things that he was talking about. 
[01:53:30]  I met Alex in the nineties and there was a lot of things that he was talking about back  then.  I was like, this guy's out of his fucking mind.  And then freedom of information act results come out and it turns out that he was right  about false flag events.  He was right about operation Northwoods.  He was right about the government faking the war, the Gulf of Tonkin incident in order  to get us into the war of Vietnam.  He's right about a lot of shit.  He was right about the government trying to engineer a false flag attack to get us into  a war in Iran before the end of the Bush administration. 
[01:54:00]  This has all been proven that Dick Cheney had these ideas and they were tossing them around.  He's right about a lot of shit.  Unfortunately, he's got a video called 9-1-1, the road to tyranny.  I think it's called, and it's all about the world trade organization, the WTO in Seattle  and how the government sent in military people like undercover military guys to pretend to  be protesters.  The protests were all peaceful.  So they send in these paid anarchists to break windows and light cars on fire and shit 
[01:54:30]  so they can come in and physically shut down all the protests, including the peaceful  protests.  And he breaks it down with news reports, with like real facts.  And it's really fucking crazy when you watch it.  But as nutty as he is about a lot of shit, he's right about a lot of shit too.  And when you live in that world all day like he does, you know, you start seeing boogeymen  around every corner.  But around some corner, they are boogeymen.  You know what?  You're right. 
[01:55:00]  It's almost like because he cries wolf a lot, but there are times where he's accurate.  Like for him, he'll say so many things like he never sees the truth in things.  He sees conspiracy all the time when he shouldn't.  And when he says stuff, I hear nonsense all the time when I shouldn't.  Right, right.  The truth is, I almost said truth is somewhere in the middle, but I caught myself because  I'm not a douche.  Well, his latest video, he doesn't think Obama cried.  What do you think about that?  How could you not cry?  Thank you.  I think Obama is probably privy to some pretty fucking horrific information about what's going 
[01:55:30]  on overseas.  Just the fact that he's aware of these drone attacks.  And look, people, I absolutely think that what happened in Connecticut is a horrific, horrific  thing.  But someone had a really good point on Twitter.  They wrote, you know, 27 people die in Connecticut, 20 children die in Connecticut, and everyone cries.  20 children die in drone attacks, crickets.  And that's true, man. 
[01:56:00]  We are sending flying robots to other countries and launching missiles from them, and thousands  of innocent people have died from these.  It's in the thousands now.  It's scary fucking shit, man.  It's really scary shit.  And this guy, Obama, you know, he's aware of that stuff.  He's aware of what's going on.  And he's, he must, look, that guy's hair is not getting gray because he's getting good  rest in a lot of life.  He must be seeing some crazy shit. 
[01:56:30]  He really is.  He really is aging like a Star Trek episode.  That's unbelievable.  I think he's aged more than any other president in recent memory.  It's kind of creepy to see.  Well, I think he has more intelligence than Bush, so his detachment is probably lower.  So his, you know, his absorbing of what the reality really is is probably, it's probably,  a motherfucker probably never sleeps.  They probably got him on all kinds of that.  He's a man being.  Yeah, he's probably, yeah.  Who knows what the fuck he's on to try to stay awake. 
[01:57:00]  He's probably also more of an idealistic guy, I think.  Like, I actually, I believe some of his idealism when he went into office.  Because, I mean, look, all politicians are full of shit on some level, but I really did  think that there was a bit more of an honest, because he hadn't been in the game nearly  as long as most of the guys that run.  Like, he hadn't been a seasoned politician as long as most of them.  And I think some of the things he really thought he could change.  And now that he's there and he realizes, I am not much more, if at all, more transparent  than the last guy or the next guy.  Like, when you realize, like, Jesus, I meant what I said, and here I am doing the same shit. 
[01:57:30]  That has to bother you on some level, too.  Why would he want to be re-elected, then?  Tough gig.  I think he probably feels like he can change things.  Sure.  And if he wasn't there, and you get some other robot dude who's just going to listen to the  military-industrial complex that Eisenhower was warning us about, then shit could get  really out of hand.  I mean, who the fuck knows?  I mean, there's a reason why the guy hasn't closed down Guantanamo Bay.  I mean, what is that?  Is it because he knows something that we don't know?  Is it because he has access to information that showed, you know, who knows what led him 
[01:58:00]  to not do the things that he promised?  I mean, who knows what happens when you get in office like that old Bill Hicks joke about  the room full of smoky industrialists where they show you an angle of the Kennedy assassination  that no one's ever seen before.  Hey, I'm here and you've got to go, Joe.  Really?  Oh, good.  All right.  E-Rock's telling me you've got to go.  We certainly don't want you to go.  E-Rock, why are you saying that?  E-Rock, what's the problem?  His publicist said he's already over.  He has other interviews.  Oh, what are you promoting, Joe?  We didn't know what you're promoting.  I got a new special that's out now, today. 
[01:58:30]  Nice.  It's a new comedy special that's available on JoeRogan.net.  I released it Louis C.K. style on the internet for five bucks.  Nice.  Good for you.  Yeah, that's, I think, the future of doing specials.  You know, I think a lot of guys are doing that now.  That's great.  And it seems to me like the best way for me to do it.  You're going to make a shitload of money.  That's smart, dude.  That's a new model, man.  Wow.  It's taking power from the networks.  Everyone's online, JoeRogan.net. 
[01:59:00]  What's the name of the special?  Live from the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle Theater in Atlanta.  That's great, dude.  That's where I filmed it.  And I think, you know, Louis C.K. did an amazing thing.  He's a real trendsetter in this sense.  And he's a, you know, he really opened up a lot of people's eyes.  They're like, yeah, well, why would you put this shit on Comedy Central and get no return,  get no money from the DVD sales?  And it makes it easier.  It's cheaper for five bucks.  It's like, it's a really reasonable rate, I think.  Yeah, Comedy Central did it to themselves. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, they did.  They really needed to figure that stuff out before you guys did.  Well, I think it was all networks.  It's like, you know, eventually they, you know, they fuck up.  Well, I'll absolutely be downloading this.  I love pretty much everything you do, Joe.  I'm a big fan of the podcast, which is just taking over the world.  It's the go-to podcast.  It wouldn't exist.  It wouldn't exist if I had never come on your show.  And that is an absolute 100% fact.  If I had never realized how fun it was to just hang out and shoot the shit with friends on the radio, 
[02:00:00]  I would have never done it.  And then once you guys went to the satellite, I realized how fun it is to do it uncensored.  I would have never done the podcast if it wasn't for you guys.  That's 100% cool.  I just listened to the Dom Marrera one, and I really liked it a lot.  We never really hit it off with Dom, unfortunately, but we probably should give him another chance.  I love Dom.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  You guys were great together.  I just listened to that the other day.  You know, Dom quickly was part of the whole Philly fiasco that Bill Burr blew up. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, yeah, that's right.  And Dom had a bad set that day, too.  It was a wild crowd.  Jimmy Schubert ate it, then Dom Marrera ate it, and Bill Burr was watching this backstage,  just a little behind-the-scenes shit, and he's like, fuck that.  You know Bill and his issues.  He's like, that ain't happening to me, man.  He went out like Maximus, though.  Oh, boy, did he.  It was a glorious moment.  Are you not entertained?  Right.  Fuck you and fuck the Liberty Bell.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  It was fucking brutal.  And the fucking fact they had to get, like, an amazing headliner to close that show out  and bring it all home.  Who closed that one?  Who remembers?  It's not important.  Joe Rogan special out today.  JoeRogan.net.  Dude, that's great.  I'm happy to see more comics doing that, and I'm a tremendous fan of your stuff.  Absolutely.  I'm a tremendous fan of all you guys.  I love the fuck out of you guys.  I think you're the best show ever in the history of radio, and I don't even think there's  a close second place.  Thank you, Joe.  Wow, Joe Rogan.  You've got to get your ass in the studio, man. 
[02:01:30]  I'll be back.  I'll be back.  There's going to be a UFC in New Jersey in a couple of months, and I'll come in a day  early just to hang with you guys.  Cool, man.  You've got to call us back soon, because there's so much more we want to talk about.  I will.  I'll call you back next week.  Does that sound good?  Yep.  Very cool.  We're on.  Oh, we're off.  We're off for a while.  How about the week after when we're home?  The week after.  Whatever.  All right, good.  All right.  Be good, buddy.  Cool, Joe.  Take care.  Take care, Joe.  Take care, man.  That's great, because Rogan has a big following, and I'm so happy that comedian after comedian 
[02:02:00]  is now, Aziz did it, Joe's doing it.  Taking it back, yes.  Fucking Louie, who really changed the fucking game.  That redheaded fucking zilch changed the game.  I would think that douche would be such an innovator.  Dude, he fucking him and his fucking, his weird circle head and his weird circle body  has changed the fucking game for community.  It's amazing what he did.  Gaffigan did it.  It's so great.  It really is.  That these guys with fucking, I want to do that someday, too.  Yes.  It's special.  Oh, yeah.  It's encouraging. 
[02:02:30]  I can't do it now.  You should do it next time.  No, no, no.  Honestly, I don't have the following of a lawyer.  Oh, my God.  Realistically, I don't.  And I'm okay with that.  You can make 30, 40 bucks, Jim.  And, you know, from your lips to God's ears.  I don't know.  And, of course, Joe Rogan on Twitter there, so.  Who has JoeRogan.com?  Just give it to him.  Oh, he doesn't have that yet?  No, he doesn't.  Maybe he does.  Maybe he does.  I'm yelling.  It might be his.  Yeah.  Is he?  Let's see.  No.  What is that?  Is it a realtor?  Joe Rogan, the realtor? 
[02:03:00]  Do you know how fucking brutal I would have had people ask him for?  Oh, my God.  Right?  They'd be asking to buy cocks and dog shit.  The house next door to me was sold to Joe Rogan.  I would fucking just spend a million bucks or something, man.  Oh, that's pretty good.  Give a fuck.  This should be an unwritten law.  Law.  I mean, if you're the most popular Joe Rogan, you should get this shit.  The Tom Green situation.  The more popular Joe Rogan, yes.  Why not?  I don't think it's the realtor.  Put your name in the fucking hat. 
[02:03:30]  And then someone, you know, the social networking world decides, all right, who is the most popular  Joe Rogan?  He gets JoeRogan.com.  Right.  Not some dumb real estate guy.  Wouldn't it be funny if the Joe Rogan realtor had two million Twitter followers and actually  had a blog about UFC that was bigger than Rogan's?  He has a podcast with fucking four million listeners just talking about property values.  I don't know what a dull fucking blog that would be.  Oh, yeah.  And he would be saying something about, like, you know, the grass regrowing on Sycamore Street, 
[02:04:00]  LOL.  It's got like four million views.  I said four million twice.  Go to improv.  Silch.  We're going to break.  When we get back, we're going to play a couple O&A Christmas songs.  Oh.  Two that you might have heard before.  All right.  And then a brand new one?  And two that you have not heard.  Oh.  Yes.  I can't wait.  And three out of the four have something to do with E-Rock.  Oh, no.  I hope they're about him spreading holiday cheer and joy. 
[02:04:30]  I'm sure they are.  This is our way of bringing everyone back together after the last few days of horror.  We're going to do that next for everyone.  No girl wants a secretly gay boyfriend.  Every dude wants a secretly gay girlfriend.  Isn't that crazy?  That's weird, man.  Even girls who like gay dudes don't like the bisexual dudes.  And I know this is San Francisco.  And there's, you know, a lot of gay people here and shit.  And I'm not homophobic.  Let me just state that clearly before we start with this material. 
[02:05:00]  But let's be honest.  There's a huge difference between gay people and bisexual dudes.  Gay dudes, that's clearly a genetic roll of the dice.  Everybody's got their own roll.  I'm short.  My fucking hair's falling out like it's on fire.  All right?  Look at that shit.  I didn't ask for that.  I take pills.  It doesn't matter.  It's like, fuck you.  Jump loose.  Okay.  Some people get the gay.  You got that gay thing.  No big deal.  I'll be your friend.  Just don't try to fuck me.  I don't have it.  There's a lot of guys who do.  Go fuck them. 
[02:05:30]  Have good times.  Nobody cares.  If you care, you're an asshole.  Really clearly.  But there's a big difference between gay dudes and bisexual dudes.  Because every bisexual dude I've ever met is a fucking idiot.  Every one.  Every single one.  And I have a theory.  I don't think there really are bisexual dudes.  I think there's two types of guys who do gay things.  There's gay dudes.  And then there's really gullible straight dudes who get talked into blowing crafty gay dudes. 
[02:06:00]  I think some clever gay man finds some unsuspecting dork who has no friends.  And it's like, come on, man.  You never had a buddy before?  Not really.  Basically, you're my first friend.  Suck my dick.  Come on.  Are we really going to play like this?  You know, I mean, if you had a friend that, like, used to fuck guys and then he stopped,  would you ever listen to him ever again? 
[02:06:30]  Like, if he gave you advice about something, you'd always go, oh, yeah, oh, that guy, hmm.  You know, like, what'd you do?  You used to have sex with guys?  Hey, listen, man.  I tried it for a little while because I was just open-minded.  And I just realized I was lying to myself.  It wasn't my thing, you know?  It was just, you know, I don't regret it, you know?  Okay.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Everything he says is always going to take with a little grain of salt.  Hmm.  And if you get in an argument, for sure that's coming up.  For sure.  For sure. 
[02:07:00]  A hundred percent.  Right?  As soon as shit starts getting personal.  Like, listen, man, I know you didn't spend a whole lot of time in school, so I'm just  trying to explain this to you.  Bush might not be the brightest guy in the world, but he surrounds himself with a great  cabinet, and that's why he's a good president.  Um, didn't you suck a cock once?  I mean, what the fuck does that have to do with anything?  I'm just saying.  Your judgment's a little suspect there.  Fella.  Checkmate!  You win. 
[02:07:30]  You win.  Always.  No matter what.  No matter what you did.  No matter what the argument is.  Win.  Shh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh.  You better dye your hair and move out of state, bitch.  You're never going to win an argument.  We're driving in the car.  Him and you miss the exit.  Um, didn't you suck a dick once?  Yeah.  I guess we all make mistakes.  Crazy.  Isn't that silly?  Ho, ho, ho. 
[02:08:00]  Merry Christmas.  A month or two ago, you asked me for a date.  You said for Christmas Eve, by then you'd lose some weight.  I think I understand the tinsel in your hair. 
[02:08:30]  But why have you got mistletoe inside your underwear?  Oh, jingle balls, jingle balls, jingle to and fro.  Oh, watching all the little puppies making yellow snow.  Oh, jingle balls, jingle balls, jingle with me.  Why don't you come over here and jingle balls with me?  Splashing in your gash on a one-horse open sleigh.  My parents think you're trash, but I think you're OK.  Filling fart balloons from a nozzle up my ass. 
[02:09:00]  I'd like to fill another, but I think I'm on a gas.  Oh, jingle balls, jingle balls, jingle to and fro.  Watching all the little children eating yellow snow.  Oh, jingle balls, jingle balls, jingle one, two, three.  Why don't you come over here and jingle balls with me?  Why don't you come over here and jingle balls with me?  A little Christmas music by John Valby, huh? 
[02:09:30]  John Valby.  He sounds so young there, right?  His voice sounds like fucking...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He wasn't like, ah, I get...  Before the alcohol ravaged him.  Exactly.  How's he doing, man?  Lost his house.  Yeah.  Oh, fire, fuck.  I reached out to him.  He was doing all right, but now what? 
[02:10:00]  I don't know.  I haven't heard hide nor hair from him, as they say.  I certainly hope he's doing well.  We're all big fans of John Valby.  Me too.  Oh, yeah, really fast, and then we're going to get into a couple Christmas songs  that have something to do with E-Rush.  Oh, can't wait.  Uh, remember those Scarlett Johansson fucking nude photos we all got to see?  No.  Which ones are you talking about?  Sam, would you want to punch him up so you could refresh my memory, please? 
[02:10:30]  I saw him because I'm a huge fan of I Like Girls Daily on Twitter.  Oh.  At I Like Girls Daily.  Oh.  That's where I saw him.  Um, but certainly someone else, uh...  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Look at that ass on her.  Oh, dude, she is...  I would love to just...  It's a long, plump cheek with a deep crack.  She does have a long ass line.  God, it's amazing.  It's good, though.  It's very...  I'm not complaining.  I'm just saying it's a little long.  I don't have enough tongue to shove up her asshole.  Dude.  I would be yearning. 
[02:11:00]  I would be cursing God, going,  God, why didn't you give me a longer tongue so I could shove it further in her asshole?  Jesus Christ.  Imagine fucking...  I would come in her every time.  Jim, I'm out of the bill.  So you do want to be a father.  But with her...  It has nothing to do with wanting to be a father.  She'd be like, Jim, today's a...  You really shouldn't.  I'm off you.  I'm off you.  I would actually jerk off in my hand and then throw it in her pussy as she was running out the room.  I would lay on the floor and disguise myself as a rug, 
[02:11:30]  and I would just throw it up at her twat as she ran over me.  Try to get it into her womb.  Oh, my God.  Oh, we're just going off.  We all remember.  We did the whole bit.  We'll all remember where we were when we saw the Scarlett Johansson pictures for the first time.  That wonderful first time.  Well, the guy that hacked her...  Was it a phone?  Yeah, it was her phone.  The hacker who leaked the nude photos of Scarlett Johansson.  Ten years in jail.  Ten years.  Ten years. 
[02:12:00]  That's not justice.  Wow.  I'm happy, though.  That's not justice.  His name is Christopher Cheney.  Oh.  And he hacked it to other people's phones, and...  Yeah, but he also fucked with people at work, and he sent some girl's father nude pictures of her.  Like, this guy was a creepy cocksucker.  It wasn't, like, just an innocent, hey, celebrity tits.  Like, this guy was a scumbag.  Was he a stalker?  I don't know.  Is that, like, what he did?  Is that what he got busted on?  Stalking or something?  I don't know.  It's probably in the story, but... 
[02:12:30]  Because if he sent some chick's fucking nude pictures to the girl's father...  Maybe he has one.  That's despicable.  Wow, what a fucking prick.  That guy's a real bum.  Ten years.  People get that for...  Murder.  For some cases of murder.  Yeah.  Manslaughter, whatever.  Rape.  A little rapety-rape.  Yeah, Sam brought that up earlier, didn't you?  Didn't you, young Sam?  No, he didn't, Sam, that you could have raped Scarlett Johansson and got him ten years?  You all right?  I've never been raped before.  No, it's voluntary, because you push back. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, yeah.  It clenches your little fists up.  It's not rape if you push back, Sam.  We all know that.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Learn that lesson, please.  It's voluntary.  Before it's too late.  You rape the audience's ears every day from 10 to 11, except for Wednesdays when Jim Norton  comes in with his advice show.  And they finally get that nice layer of protection that they've been looking for.  It was a hit.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Like suspected terrorists, we come back and torture them again.  Exactly. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you, Chip.  There's a dumb story coming out of Coney Island, by the way.  Judge rules Coney Island's wooden boardwalk will be replaced with plastic.  Really?  It's about time.  Oh, man.  People don't...  Wooden boardwalks suck!  People like the clunkety-clunk of wood under their feet.  Yeah, but they don't like the splinters.  Yeah.  No, that's true.  Plastic.  Nothing worse than, like, barefoot on a wooden boardwalk.  That plastic shit looks like wood enough.  I think so.  Like, they kind of form it to look like wood grain and shit. 
[02:14:00]  It's obviously not, but...  But this was a big deal down there, but...  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, Coney Island, sorry, it's a shithole.  Yeah.  They're trying.  They're trying really hard to bring it back to the glory days.  Trying real hard.  But...  Better bring back that diving horse.  That would be nice.  That would get people in there.  That would be terrific, sure.  Just clear it with PETA first.  Hey, we're going to take a horse up 100 feet, and we're going to jump him into a big thing  of water.  Anything a rabbit can do, Bruno do better. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, brother.  That's all they think of with those stupid high jump things, is the episode of Bugs Bunny  and Bruno.  And they kept cranking the handle up, and the platform went higher and higher.  You remember that one, Sam?  No, I don't.  Of course you don't.  You're not a child of the 80s.  You're not a child of the 80s, obviously.  Yeah.  If you don't remember that one.  Maybe I am, obviously.  No, you're not.  No.  I watched Denver, The Last Dinosaur.  Oh, boy.  What?  All right. 
[02:15:00]  How old are you?  About 35 at this point?  29.  29.  A young 29.  Let me ask you a question.  I'll leave you at 30.  Not young Sam.  We used to call him young Sam for many years.  Young Sam.  Not young Sam.  Give me your top five cartoons.  We call them cartoons.  That you saw growing up.  Number one was easily Thundercats.  Thun, thun, Thundercats?  Oh.  Do you know Thundercats?  Yeah.  I don't know that one. 
[02:15:30]  He-Man Masters of the Universe.  Don't know it.  Heard of it.  He-Man, yeah.  My Little Pony.  I didn't watch that show.  That was for girls and I was a boy.  You're probably a Dora guy.  Dora wasn't around when I was a kid.  Oh.  I watched Denver, The Last Dinosaur.  He's our friend and a whole lot more.  Uh-huh.  Sure you did.  Muppet Babies.  Yeah, I showed you where Muppet Babies came from.  Muppet Babies.  I pulled on your pajama bottoms and I said, now you push like a girl. 
[02:16:00]  And the baby comes out and you said, Uncle Paul, what are your fingers doing?  I said, I'm helping the baby preach.  And then I kissed the baby.  Remember I leaned over and kissed where the baby was coming?  I don't remember.  Oh, boy.  Oh, jeez.  Your little Hulkamaniac pajamas.  I pulled them down and there was a little tinkle in them and your father and I was laughing.  It's just fucking horrible.  I smelled your dried pee-pee on your Hulkamaniac PJ bottoms.  I'm sure I kissed your little bottom. 
[02:16:30]  Tiny Toons could come in fifth place, but that was a little later.  Tiny Toons.  That's five?  Yeah.  What about Animaniacs?  That was even later, but I did watch it.  You know Animaniacs?  I watched Animaniacs.  Yeah.  We are the Animaniacs.  What do you mean you watched Animaniacs?  How far does that show go back?  Not very far, but I watched cartoons well into my 30s.  I watched my cartoons well into my 30th years.  But the only cartoon I enjoy, because I have to go back into that world because of the 
[02:17:00]  kid, is SpongeBob.  Yeah, never.  You never got into SpongeBob?  There was no reason for me to do that.  There's some adult humor there.  There was no real reason for me to do that.  Smidge.  What were our top five cartoons?  We would have to go with Bugs Bunny.  We'd have to go with the Flintstones.  Well, Bugs Bunny is weird because I liked the ones from the 40s and shit.  The original ones.  The original ones.  Right, of course.  But we had those growing up.  Yeah, they re-ran them.  They made the switch somewhere in the 80s, I think.  Yeah, they re-ran them. 
[02:17:30]  But for when I was a kid, actually, and the cartoons were being put out, it was things  like the Flintstones.  Jetsons.  Shit like that.  Yeah, yeah.  The Dilla Gorilla.  Scooby-Doo.  Right.  Scooby-Scooby-Doo.  I watched the little Jetsons.  Little Jetsons.  No, no, no.  That's like old man shit.  Underdog?  I'm just saying.  That's like a name.  Underdog.  I didn't say it, too.  There's no need to fear.  Right.  Underdog is here.  I didn't say it.  I watched it.  I'm just bringing it into the sky.  I watched it, Sam.  What the fuck?  Just bringing up names.  Yeah, I don't fucking go for that old man shit. 
[02:18:00]  You know who Sammy used to like?  Scrappy-Doo.  He'd always, Scrappy-Doo would come on and Sam's little legs would kick.  Yay, Scrappy-Doo.  And I'd make propeller noises on your thighs.  I hated Scrappy-Doo.  I did, too.  Who's a cunt?  Scrappy-Doo fucked the whole Scooby-Doo franchise up.  I wanted to see tire tracks and Scrappy-Doo's back legs.  Oh, and Hulk Hogan's Rockin' Wrestling. 
[02:18:30]  That was a cartoon.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Iron Sheik was on it.  Was he?  Did he humble people by fucking them in the ass?  In a cartoon?  What happened?  He was on a kid's cartoon, and then he's talking about humbling people by fucking their asses.  I humble Sweet Penelope Pitstop by fucking her ass.  I fuck her ass.  I humble her.  But then in the end, he couldn't keep his urine in.  No.  And he's mad at us.  And he's mad at us.  Get out of here.  Yeah, if he pissed his pants for me.  One of the greatest moments on satellite radio was him being his pants. 
[02:19:00]  Great.  God, was that fantastic.  Right up there.  All right.  Yeah, we got some Christmas songs.  Tis the season.  Kimba the White Lion.  Yes, I do remember that.  Kimba.  Kimba.  Before Simba.  There was Kimba the White Lion.  Kimba the White Lion is his name.  And there was a cartoon.  But Kimba, that was him.  It's some Jap cartoon, obviously.  Because look at the animation.  It looks like anime. 
[02:19:30]  You expect Kimba to start going,  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's an anime series from the 1960s, though.  Yeah.  I'm unfamiliar with it.  Yeah, most people were unfamiliar with Kimba the White Lion.  But I remember it.  I don't know that one.  And Speed Racer, too.  I remember Speed Racer.  Go Speed Racer.  Go Speed Racer.  Yeah.  Oh.  He was always going,  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  He was like,  Oh, oh, oh.  He was early anime.  Yeah, yeah.  That was another one.  Yeah, that feel. 
[02:20:00]  The big Jap anime eyes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way,  a quick tweet from Reed Harris at UFC.  He says,  So Dana White brought the red hot chili peppers  to the UFC office Christmas party last night.  But I'm sure SiriusXM does at least the stones  and a smiley face,  which is a fuck you.  Which is a fuck you.  But Dana brings the fucking red hot chili peppers  into his company to...  And our Christmas party was in the lobby.  Oh, how was it?  I got a cavity filled instead of going.  Yes, you're asshole. 
[02:20:30]  Whatever it takes to get that raise, right, Sam?  You backed right into that one, Sam.  Yeah.  Sam went right over to the fucking out-kill.  Got a cavity filled.  I want two cavities filled in each hand.  Well, I'm sure you've heard about the Christmas party.  How was it?  Was it a success?  The highlight was...  First of all, if it's in a lobby,  it's never going to be a success.  Of course not.  No, the lobby.  What media company has a Christmas party in a lobby? 
[02:21:00]  SiriusXM Satellite Radio.  I guess so.  And the only highlight was  Roland drank far more than anybody else  and was screaming at the top of his lungs.  Wait, was there alcohol involved?  How does he keep his job?  Oh, okay.  They are...  I'm amazed,  because they aren't scared of having a little booze  in the lobby when there's parties.  Okay, there's nothing.  Any pictures taken in the photo booth?  No, the photo booth was closed off to them.  Why?  Why?  Roland should have been in there.  Only celebrities are allowed to go in the photo booth.  We're not allowed in there.  We can't go in there?  No.  Fuck.  When was it? 
[02:21:30]  It was last Thursday, I think.  I'm fucking busy!  Sorry.  I didn't even hear about it.  No.  Check your work email.  There's a reason for that.  I know.  That's true.  My work email's not even set up anymore.  Hasn't been set up in months.  I hope I'm not getting an important email.  I don't think I've ever had a work email set up.  Roland's coming down.  Oh, is he?  With his take on...  He was complaining a lot about the food.  A lot.  Why?  I got drunk text message after drunk text message from Roland  complaining about the food being cold, 
[02:22:00]  and that it was like frozen dinner,  but not heated up.  Sounds terrible.  Yeah, he was really pissed about the food.  And also very drunk.  Roland.  Roland?  How was the Christmas party?  Yeah, tell us about the Christmas party.  I'm psyched.  I want to hear about it.  You can eat the food or lick your asshole.  It has the same flavor.  Oh!  Roland.  So the food was amazing?  Ice cold.  If you want a taste of food,  just pull out a frozen dinner and start licking it. 
[02:22:30]  That is a tasty asshole.  Yeah.  What kind of food do they serve?  Ice cold sliders?  Urine?  Ice cold sliders.  Three trays of veggie sliders for the four vegetarians in the company.  Yeah, he's very pissed.  Why is he angry?  The company supplies several platters of veggie sliders for what Roland reported as the four vegetarians in the company that would enjoy something like that.  Because at the end of the night, there was stacks of veggie sliders and people just stared at it like, ugh. 
[02:23:00]  Stacks on stacks.  And there was ice cold crab cakes smothered in grease.  Nice.  Nice.  Smothered in grease.  Sounds delicious.  There is a thing they try to call a quesadilla, but it was just a tortilla wrapped in shit.  Is that Mexican food?  It isn't even Mexican food.  It's just shit.  Mexican.  It's just shit on top of shit.  Do you see how it's easier to understand him when you're sitting here with him?  A little bit, yes.  When I'm driving, though, and I'm listening, wow, it's a little difficult. 
[02:23:30]  What is that?  But sitting here, it's like, what is that?  What is that?  An awful thing they call salsa.  It tastes like ketchup with onions.  And then to top it off, they even had more shit on top of more shit.  It was awful.  Egg noodles with ketchup.  Did you feel like a schnook?  My stomach goes, I'm going to just shit this all down in five minutes.  Oh, wow.  You should be in charge of the food for every company party, I think.  Or at least, if whoever booked the food, go for a tasting. 
[02:24:00]  It's out there.  All right.  I'll book it for you guys.  Just say, here's a tasting.  Wow, this really tastes like shit.  Let's go to the next caterer.  Was anybody getting nervous at your intoxication level?  No, I was just wishing everybody Merry Christmas.  How about shouting Merry Christmas at executives?  Well, it's just Christmas spirit, though.  Who did he shout it to?  He did tell me that he was yelling Merry Christmas at Steve Blatter. 
[02:24:30]  Not too loud.  Like, Merry Christmas, because he was walking around.  I want to make sure everybody knows it's Christmas.  Did he have fun?  I don't think he liked the food, either.  Why?  Because when you see people take a bite of the food, they're like, oh.  It was cold.  It was ice cold.  Warm that shit up.  I thought I knew you so well.  Because it's five o'clock.  You're hungry.  It's still cold.  You're waiting for the food.  And then you wait in line.  You're like, oh, God.  Yeah.  What did you think of the movie last night?  I loved it.  That's the second time I saw it.  What? 
[02:25:00]  I saw it.  I saw it.  What time is the screening today?  There isn't one.  I thought they were going to try to get one.  Yeah.  They couldn't get one.  How about they just get us a copy of the movie?  I'll watch it.  I'll see if we get a copy.  I'll watch it.  I'll be happy to watch it.  I want to interview Judd.  I'll be happy to watch it.  No, you'll bootleg it.  You can't be trusted with a screener copy.  But I really wouldn't.  I'm not a bootlegger.  I think you are.  Ah, bootleg-o?  I used to bootleg, but then they legalized booze.  Take us out, you fucking embarrassment.  That's terrible.  I might have gotten into an altercation of the movie last night. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, yeah, you did.  Oh, no.  Did you like the movie?  He yelled at the security guard.  Yeah.  For what?  Well, because we get to go to these, like, previews, right?  And, you know, the movie's all right.  And, you know, I do what anyone else does.  You pick up your phone and check your shit.  Your phone is really bright, though.  My eyes are watering.  That's the thing now.  It's not just about the noise the phone makes, but the light that comes off of the phone.  If you're in front of somebody and they're behind you, it does fucking interfere with you. 
[02:26:00]  I was interfering with anybody's viewing experience.  I know that much.  And I was kind of, like, doing the old, like, angle thing as best as possible.  Apparently not, O.P.  And I was checking on.  I was absolutely checking on my kids back at home there.  And the black security guy comes up and goes, you're going to have to turn that phone off.  And I just fucking.  You snapped at him.  I probably snapped a little bit.  Oh, what did you say?  I go, don't worry.  I'm not bootlegging the film.  Trust me on that one.  Drop the M-bomb?  No. 
[02:26:30]  It doesn't.  It didn't come into my head.  No, you said, shut up.  And the guy goes, no, you shut up.  You shut up.  No, you shut up.  Yeah, there was a shut up thing going on.  Wow.  I go, listen, you already told me to shut up.  I go, by the way, this is way more distracting than my dumb phone.  Oh, man.  Which is true.  I won in the end.  Yeah.  You know I won in the end.  Yeah, the last words.  Was it a battle?  It was a battle.  I really thought I was going to be yanked out of the air, which would have been so embarrassing.  That would have been great, though.  How many people were there? 
[02:27:00]  It was a packed house.  So it was distracting everybody when you got into this argument.  Yeah, but I, yeah.  It's during the heartfelt moment between Paul Rudd and Lizzie Mann, and then he's like,  What happened?  Wow.  What?  What was it?  What was that?  You got distracted during the heartfelt moment?  I was talking to my kids, and this guy didn't appreciate that, and I think he thought I was bootlegging  it on my stupid Samsung S3. 
[02:27:30]  It's a very bright phone, though.  It's a what?  It's a bright phone.  Bright?  Ooh.  Oh, my phone is bright.  Oh, I thought you said it was a very bright film.  I'm going to turn down my screen brightness.  Oh.  I did not know.  Sometimes you've got to be told these things.  I'm going to do that right now.  I'm in the settings.  I got display.  You still shouldn't take out your phone during the movie.  Yeah, it is pretty high up there.  What?  You still shouldn't take out your phone during the movie.  Wow.  But on his defense, a lot of people were, you could see little spots of lights throughout 
[02:28:00]  the whole film.  Oh, so other people were doing it.  That's not good.  Oh, were they checking on?  No.  They're all publicists, segment producers.  Shit to check on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's not good.  So Judd's coming in tomorrow?  Yeah.  Him and David Tell.  Yeah, David Tell.  Oh, cool.  Can't wait to see David Tell tomorrow.  We've got to use him more.  All right.  You want to play some Christmas songs?  Yes, please.  Yay.  Something to get the mood a little bit happier in here.  Yes.  All right.  E-Rock, you don't mind if we start with an E-Rock Christmas song, do you? 
[02:28:30]  What else would there be?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, fucking Santa Grinch.  Hey, Scrooge.  Jeez.  In all fairness to E-Rock, three out of the next four songs I'm about to play have something  to do with him.  Yeah, but are they a positive thing?  Huh?  It's Christmas.  They're like, oh, we love E-Rock.  We're so thankful for him.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  Here comes Piggy Boy.  Here comes Piggy Boy.  Winking around the turn.  That wouldn't be it.  Oh, wait.  One of these we just threw in there. 
[02:29:00]  It's not even a Christmas song about E-Rock.  It's just a brand new E-Rock Christmas.  E-Rock song.  Excuse me.  Just a song.  So three out of the four are Christmas songs.  Yes.  And three out of the four have something to do with E-Rock.  Should we start with a non-Christmas song?  Four out of the four.  Oh, really?  He's beginning to look a lot like a hippo.  Oh.  Everywhere.  What?  Now you're just giving people ideas.  Oh.  When is my screen going to be fixed so I can see his reaction to this?  I hate not being able to see him.  In the meadow, we can eat some Steakums. 
[02:29:30]  Steakums.  And pretend that they are cups of fruit.  Get it?  Get it.  I'm a big fan of the get it part.  He started chewing on his fingers when you said Steakums.  Those aren't his fingers.  Those are uncooked sausage links.  I'm dreaming of a white castle.  I was at the Nagel residence.  When?  Oh.  I got to tell you, E-Rock has the best treats.  Does he?  He really does. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, E-Rock treats.  What kind of treats you got, bitch-ass motherfucker?  What was that goldfish shit we were eating?  They were actually live goldfish.  He just hops in the tub and swoops them up in his mouth.  We went over there.  Remember when we were growing up, well, they probably didn't even have goldfish officially.  But when goldfish first came out, it was the one lousy flavor.  That was it.  One.  Now they've decided, fuck that, we're going to have a shitload of flavors.  What was the one we were eating?  Vanilla cupcake.  Vanilla cupcake goldfish. 
[02:30:30]  I wouldn't like that.  I wouldn't like the sweet.  Those are cookies, right?  It was amazing.  Eric and my daughter have the same treats.  Aw.  It sounds delicious.  Probably the same genitals, too.  E-Rock's a girl.  But I wouldn't even know that.  I didn't even know vanilla cupcake goldfish even existed until I went over to his house.  That sounds fucking great.  Why don't we get some right now?  If you like yellow wafers, you'll love these.  I'm telling you, they're amazing.  Can we send someone out to get them?  Please.  Of course we can.  All right.  Let's get some fucking goldfish. 
[02:31:00]  Okay.  I want to taste those because it sounds fucking amazing.  This is not about beating up Eric, by the way.  It's about how he really does know his treats.  Well, look at him.  Of course he does.  Hold on.  Listen, Rockefeller's just pulling out some money for the goldfish.  It was so funny watching Ant reach into his pocket like, it's on me.  It's on me.  Bag of goldfish.  My goldfish.  Here, get some goldfish.  Yeah, the vanilla cupcake goldfish.  And then-  Send some fucker out for some goldfish.  But you know he treats them like crackers, like they're not a bad snack. 
[02:31:30]  Yes.  Even though they're obviously cookies.  Yeah, they're cookies now.  Now, I'm going to wait because there's other kinds of goldfish, or do you just want these?  I just want these.  No, those immediately because we're running out of time.  Yeah, like they're s'mores, goldfish.  No, just go with those.  Okay.  Please.  And then what were the Oreos we ate that I had no idea about until-  Chocolate cover?  Oh.  No, no.  Listen to this one, Ant.  Go ahead.  Cookies and cream Oreos.  Cookies and cream Oreos.  But isn't Oreos what the Oreos are?  Cookies that are-  It's crumbled up Oreos inside an Oreo.  Yeah, that stinks, that snack.  They give you a little more. 
[02:32:00]  No.  It's a paradox.  I had ten.  Dude, did you have any fucking-  Ten!  I'm not kidding.  That's why I don't have any of this shit in my house.  When I go to someone else's house, game over.  I can't control myself.  It feels like it doesn't count for some reason.  It feels like lima bean goldfish.  Those are delicious.  Have some lima goldfish.  They have a mealy, soft texture.  That's why I almost believe in the gun control argument, because I don't have Oreos in my  house, but certainly I will search out Oreos if I have to.  Oh, you respect people's right to have Oreos in their house. 
[02:32:30]  Well, I just know if I have to, I will get my hands on Oreos, is what I'm saying.  Cookies and cream Oreos is weird, because it is Oreos.  No, it was just a little subtle change, and it really was good.  What else do you have in their fucking oatmeal-flavored oatmeal cookies?  Fucking redundant goose egg.  What else do we have, E-Rock?  That's like a moronic E-Rock.  He brought out-  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  Let's leave more E-Rock.  He brought out a whole bunch of stuff. 
[02:33:00]  What was the other thing?  You had the cherry cordial Hershey's Kisses.  All right, I might have had a couple of those.  A cherry cordial Hershey's Kiss?  Jimmy, you would have been in heaven, and then squeezing your fat on the way home, screaming  at yourself.  Not me.  I'd have been pushing these rock-hard abs.  Out of my hands.  Ow, this shit hurts.  That's the old Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Dude, I can't.  I can't.  Like, I could control it in my own stupid house, because I just keep it out.  Yeah, I can't do it either.  But it was like one treat after another.  I couldn't stop.  E-Rock, what are you doing? 
[02:33:30]  He didn't have any, did he?  You know, he doesn't like chocolate, like he's told us.  And you know what?  It's easy to beat him up, but he was, I ate way more of this than he did.  He binge ate in the kitchen.  You know what?  E-Rock doesn't eat chocolate, but he's like a goat.  Like, if you leave papers or your shoes around, he'll eat them.  Fucking eat your slippers and your book reports.  He just has shit.  Ridiculous.  He just has these things in his house that I've never heard of before.  Troughs.  Troughs. 
[02:34:00]  No, we had a...  And there's Ghir Deli chocolates with, like, strawberry inside.  Those were great.  Dude, just the goldfish.  Those were great.  Goldfish, plain goldfish.  I lick them and smell them and then eat them.  I don't know why.  Oh, my God.  Why would you do that?  I'm sick.  I lick and smell.  It doesn't smell like...  It smells good.  It doesn't smell like bread.  I'll lick and smell salty food and then eat it.  It's fucking...  You do it the other way around.  That is so stupid.  I know.  I don't know why I do it.  I'll lick it and smell it.  Goldfish is the staple of the two-year-old, so I'm in heaven.  They've got a lot of goldfish in our house.  Is that after the Oreo phase?  Oreo, the Cheerio phase? 
[02:34:30]  You never really got into the Cheerio phase.  Yeah, it's only the British.  I hate when kids have fucking...  Their slimy hand with Cheerios and they go...  And they try to offer it to you.  Like, yeah, thanks.  I'm going to eat that.  Get out of here.  Little shithead.  You're going to have to get mad about it.  They're just trying to be nice.  I hate that.  You're trying to socialize.  I don't want your saliva-ridden, sloppy, drooly fucking Oreo.  I hope you say it exactly like that.  I think I do, yes.  Get out of here.  What else do we have?  I think that's about it.  Wasn't that about it? 
[02:35:00]  Jesus.  But then we had a nice...  There was sangria, too.  We had shrimp.  Sangria.  And a little salmon.  It was a healthy meal.  And then we, like, fucked it up with all these treats.  Can I come to your house next week?  We're off, so I want to go to your house.  Oh, sure.  Party.  All right.  Party at E-Rox.  Party at E-Rox.  Having a big party.  Yeah.  E-Rox really loves Christmas, man.  Yeah?  He's way ahead of everyone else.  His outside decorations were nice.  The tree was nice.  He had a whole room dedicated to fucking wrapping gifts. 
[02:35:30]  I've never seen more gifts in anyone's house than E-Rox.  They're all from E-Rox to E-Rox.  A bunch of gifts going, yo, I am a gift, you know.  See?  They're wrapping gifts.  I'm a gift, and I'm here to say.  Open me up on Christmas Day.  Did it?  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Exactly.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Wrapping gifts. 
[02:36:00]  Yes.  Thank you.  Hey, did anyone else get Dr. Steve's chocolates?  Oh.  No.  I got that big, the, like, big tower of boxes and stuff with the cookies and chocolates and  everything.  Sweet and sweet tower.  I did not.  Oh, Dr. Steve rules.  Wait, you got a what?  I got like a tower.  It's like a big box at the bottom and then a little one and a little one and a little one.  I always knew he liked you better.  And they got what?  That son of a bitch.  Oh, man.  And one of them's got cookies in them and chocolates.  And then the next one's got like chocolate-covered pretzels. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  I got that last year.  And then ploppers.  This year, he downgraded my chocolate.  What did he get you?  It's one box of things.  Oh, man.  Delicious.  Oh.  It looks like he gave you a little extra this year.  Nice.  I brought in, Dr. Steve.  Well, who gave you the wine?  Who got you the wine?  I was just a listener.  I was a shitty-ass listener.  Thanks for fucking, you know, thinking of the fucking Anthony portion of the program.  You got the bullet chess board today.  Oh, great.  You got the chess pieces made out of bullets.  Great. 
[02:37:00]  Thanks.  I didn't get that.  Do you know, I brought in chocolates I got from my accountant to the guy I couldn't eat.  It was a big, it was like a fucking bucket of Hershey's Kisses and little crackles.  Yeah.  I put it out there and it'll win, like, in five minutes.  Yeah.  Oh, I can't do it.  I just try to keep it out of the house.  Yeah, dude, I won't bring it home.  I can't do it.  Fucking weak.  Fucking weak.  I don't cry.  See, open a fucking Overeaters Anonymous meeting just screaming at a giant chocolate bar. 
[02:37:30]  What a fucking weakness.  Well, why don't we play some of these songs?  So, we want to refresh everyone's memory with this fine Christmas song by Josh Howell, which  was part of our contest about a month ago.  Oh, it was.  About a month ago?  Yes.  That's nice.  You know Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton, Travis, Sal, and Danny, Roland, Troy, and  Sam.  But do you recall the most morbidly obese one of all? 
[02:38:00]  Morbidly obese.  E-Rock the shit dick fat fuck, he's a lazy piece of shit, and if you ever saw him, you'd  know him by his huge bitch tits, all of the other assholes laugh and call him piggy boy. 
[02:38:30]  They never let poor E-Rock have his hoagies and his shitty toys.  Oh, that's not very nice.  I'm laughing at that, but I'm also laughing at Dr. Steve.  He can't let anything go.  Oh, no.  He writes, you got the imported chocolate.  Yeah, it was imported from where, though?  Probably Florida.  Oh, what did I get? 
[02:39:00]  That's why I brought it up.  I'm going to be like, hey, you imported chocolates.  I want to know, see how he explains yours.  Damn.  He can't let any of this go at it.  They're all just dumb jokes.  The gifts are equal in value and quality.  Heartfelt thought.  Yeah.  Jim got a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  I'm very appreciative of it, but that's boring.  I don't mean half this shit.  I really don't.  He has to write, you got the imported chocolate. 
[02:39:30]  Of course he did.  It was really good.  Yeah.  I mean, if, well, I, you know, I eat a couple of them.  They were delicious.  They were really good.  You guys enjoy.  I'm going to have my fun snack.  Oh, you're getting, uh, fucking, uh, carrots.  Baby carrots.  And a little bit of, um, what is that?  Wow.  Yogurt dressing.  Half the fat and calories.  Oh, God.  Yogurt dressing.  It's fucking awful.  You ever have a carrot with yogurt dressing?  No.  Oh, no.  It's all just a motherfucker. 
[02:40:00]  Put my hands cover.  This shit is fucking delicious.  Sounds horrible.  If you want, I can bring some cake tomorrow.  Oh.  Cake?  Only if it's shotgun cake and you eat it.  What do you mean cake?  Oh, he just offers you cake.  What do you mean cake tomorrow?  We made a chocolate peppermint cake that I think you'll like.  We can bring that in.  Peppermint cake.  Oh, yeah.  Peppermint sucked my balls.  Smashed up candy cane?  Ooh. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, no, no, no, no.  That sounds horrible.  I don't want candy canes that you stepped on.  Candy canes are terrible.  Candy canes are, uh, fucking, you know, you brush your teeth in the morning.  Candy canes are overrated.  Tastes terrible.  It's like toothpaste.  I don't like candy canes.  Never did.  They fucking seal your teeth up.  They get all gunked up.  Yes.  You gotta pick them out with your friend's pecker.  And then if you fucking bite it wrong, it stabs through your cheek.  It's like chewing on pepperminty glass shards.  Fuck that. 
[02:41:00]  Ready for another, uh, E-Rock song?  Here's another E-Rock song.  Oh.  By Ramsey Norman.  Merry Christmas.  Oh, I like this song.  Dude.  Nagle sucks, nagle sucks, nagle sucks, cop.  E-Rock is bad, let's get that straight up the band.  He sucks our penises day after day.  He'd suck them all if he had his way. 
[02:41:30]  Piggy boy, piggy boy, piggy boy eat.  One thing that's salty and one thing that's sweet.  He is a lazy piece of shit on the job.  That's because he's made of flop.  His gut's big, he's a real pig.  He's eating up all the pie.  He's a phony, eats bologna.  Oh, how I wish that he would die. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, gee.  He was bad, E-Rock, that isn't it true?  This torture is all for you.  He's a real huge big tub of fat shit.  Nagle really sucks, cop.  Jesus.  Nagle really sucks, cop.  I love how they sell it.  They really do.  What's that?  Whoa.  The gay stuff?  Wrong staff member.  Oh.  That stuff's accurate, though.  Who is that?  Who's the gay guy?  Who's the gay one?  I don't know.  There's a few.  Oh, there is.  Who's gay on the staff, E-Rock? 
[02:42:30]  Who's gay?  Who's gay?  Comment.  Who's gay?  Comment.  Break it down.  Break it down.  Who's the gayest?  E-Rock?  We're all little.  What?  Harley?  See, that's E-Rock taking his shots again, but not going over.  Nice.  Fucking committing.  That was kind of funny.  Fuck it.  It was kind of funny.  He just had her song, like, saying I wish he would die.  I just had a nice dinner at his house.  I got to be hateful.  Yeah, you got to be nice now, right?  I can't go from having a really nice fucking dinner to being a diss smash.  I just can't do it anymore. 
[02:43:00]  How about a nice song?  I need a few days of buffer before I go back to that.  He just played a song that says, I wish he would die.  Ah.  And then he's coming back and saying, yeah, we're all gay.  What?  How about a nice song for Eric?  Like, prancing through the snow with a one-horse open sleigh.  Eric's in the sleigh doing radio all the way.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that couldn't be worse.  Oh, that could not have been worse.  Why don't we, um, remember Sean F? 
[02:43:30]  What did he do?  He was the one that did, uh, I'm an asshole!  Do we have it?  I don't remember it.  Do we have that one?  Do we have Sean F's entry in the O&A contest?  He doesn't remember it.  I don't remember the song.  Of course you don't.  I'm speaking for the listeners.  Right.  Did he have a couple entries?  I forget now.  Which one was his best entry?  He did, uh, he did that, the Radio Wizard, right?  Oh, right.  I think so.  Yeah, but it's by the E-Rock today, so play the E-Rock one from Sean F. 
[02:44:00]  Please.  Yeah, this one.  Please allow me to introduce myself.  Yeah, right.  I'm a man of size and weight.  Weight.  Worked in radio for a long, long time, but my skills are far from great.  Write fan fiction and I hate my job, cause they make fun of my shape.  Had to stay home after Sandy left, cause a branch blocked my escape. 
[02:44:30]  I'm an asshole.  Yeah.  Won't you guess my name?  E-Rock.  Oh yeah, I've been known as sex bagel.  And I don't watch sports at all.  Food food.  Food food.  I bring nothing to the table.  Food food.  Food food.  I love garlic, butter sauce.  Butter sauce.  So if you see me, show some sympathy, cause I don't count calories. 
[02:45:00]  I shouted out, who broke the toilet seat, when all the while, I knew it was me.  I'm an asshole.  Yeah.  Won't you guess my name?  I just like how he sings stuff.  I'm an asshole.  Asshole.  You know what my favorite part of these segments are? 
[02:45:30]  What?  Watching Roland try to laugh as quietly as he can.  Like he gets all teary-eyed and everything.  Oh yeah, yeah.  Cause he's laughing really hard, but he doesn't want E-Rock to know.  Roland loves these songs.  You like these songs?  It's the listeners.  I support them.  Since when?  Is this your last day this year?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  A lot of people are checking out, huh?  Mm-hmm.  For the rest of the year.  Vacation time.  Keith Richards, 69 years old today.  Just a little tie-in there.  Sean F.  Sent in another one.  All right.  E-Rock has big tits and he don't do shit. 
[02:46:00]  He doesn't run, doesn't run.  He's too rotund.  E-Rock has big tits.  All he does is sit in shovels grub, shovels grub.  Down his fucking gullet.  E-Rock has big tits and he don't do shit.  He doesn't run, doesn't run.  He's too rotund.  E-Rock has big tits. 
[02:46:30]  All he does is sit in shovels grub, shovels grub.  Down his fucking gullet.  E-Rock has big tits and he don't do shit.  He doesn't run, doesn't run.  E-Rock has big tits and he don't do shit.  E-Rock has big tits.  All he does is sit in shovels grub, shovels grub.  Down his fucking gullet.  That's catchy.  That is catchy, right?  Wait, that was Sean F.?  Yeah.  So he knew that the jingle contest was over.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, he did.  And it's not a Christmas song.  No.  He saw an opportunity.  For what?  Just to write another song.  Just to have us say Sean F. a few more times.  He's got a song in his heart.  The words just flow off of his pen.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Blame the guy for being a genius?  You're right.  E-Rock is...  He also sent in a Christmas song for all of us.  He's not done with the songs.  No.  This is the last one from him for now.  It's called Christmastime with O.N.A.  Aw. 
[02:47:30]  Aw.  Remember this from Die Hard.  One DMC.  It's Christmastime with O.N.A.  Ants being racist and Fezzy's gay.  Opie is howling with Danny and Hicks  while Jimmy goes trolling for chicks with dicks.  Ronnie is hanging with Travis and Sam  while E-Rock scarves down all the Christmas hands.  He won't stop eating.  He's a portly boy.  He left no stuffing for a roll on a troy.  Kenny's hanging up his Christmas sock 
[02:48:00]  while Bobby and DeRosa dream of Bailey's cock.  They were feeling pretty good.  La la la la la.  Choking on a dick.  La la la la la.  That's good.  E-Rock is back.  We all know that.  Back at the party.  Gary wants a meeting  while no talent sound  takes a verbal beating.  This channel's full of fatties,  jerk-offs, racists, and queers.  Have yourself a shitty Christmas  and happy do-yay. 
[02:48:30]  Do-yay.  Assholes.  Not bad, huh?  That's pretty goddamn good.  Show an F.  That could be the official Christmas song  of the O&A show.  He's talented.  Let's play that a couple more times  before we get out of here for Christmas.  Focused on one staff member  a little more than the others.  A little more than the others.  He might be a little obsessed on E-Rock.  Which one? 
[02:49:00]  Who was it?  Sam?  Travis?  What's it?  Fezzy?  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh.  E-Rock, I felt like,  was a little focused on that one.  E-Rock, you like the song?  He's had better.  Whoa.  I like to stick to singing hooks.  Don't try to rap.  Whoa.  Are you challenging the people out there?  Damn.  I like that E-Rock said he has better.  So which is your favorite Sean F. song?  Yeah.  Either Sympathy or the In Bloom one.  Well, Sympathy is not called,  it's not Sympathy. 
[02:49:30]  No.  I think it's I'm an asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm an asshole.  And he's referring to,  well, let's not get into that.  Well, we could play one more song for everybody  if you like.  Yeah.  Just to try not,  if you're going to write some new ones,  don't put Danny in.  It's very awkward here when the name comes up.  It's uncomfortable.  He's no longer with the company.  Why did he get fired?  You know I got fired.  I had nothing to do with his firing.  I didn't say he did it,  but you know why.  Stop blaming Opie.  Some people think I have nothing to do with it. 
[02:50:00]  I don't think it was the gag, right?  It was, I think,  what happened after the gag.  Yeah.  He planned a little gag.  Right.  I mean, this isn't something we can't talk about, right?  I think we can talk about it.  All right.  Everyone wants to know.  Danny did indeed get fired from here.  Danny no longer works with us.  He, uh,  remember that One Direction show?  That the company took very seriously?  The company was very, very serious.  Didn't want to tell the location or anything.  Danny opened his asshole and pressed it on the window, 
[02:50:30]  and everybody laughed and clapped.  A bunch of us got scolded.  Yes.  You mean to behave?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The one Opie couldn't get his knees into?  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah, but I got scolded  because we mentioned that it was going to be here.  Yeah, that it was going to be here.  And they said,  don't even mention where it's going to be.  Don't talk about the time, date,  not a place, anything.  They took this one very seriously.  Very seriously.  So they decided to have some type of a little lottery thing  with the office  that if someone won this lottery thing  that they would be able to take them and a guest. 
[02:51:00]  And how many people were in on the lottery?  It was the entire staff.  One staff member got to go.  Wait, wait, wait.  The entire company.  That's what I meant.  Not the entire staff of this show,  the entire SiriusXM staff.  Just in New York?  You could have entered if you were in D.C., of course.  So anyone could enter.  Oh, absolutely.  Nashville.  Anyone.  That's hundreds of employees.  Yes, yes, yes.  And he won.  Danny won the lottery.  Out of hundreds of employees?  With the idea being that the employee could bring a child.  Right, right, right.  So the only reason he's fired was because he won a lottery. 
[02:51:30]  Yes.  There was a string.  The lottery was supposed to be a good thing.  It's a butterfly effect.  He won the lottery to go to this.  Yeah, but if he never won the lottery, he would have been fired.  Exactly.  Okay.  Yeah, yes.  He won the lottery, though,  and decided on a plus one, which is his guest.  And he couldn't decide between Bailey J or a stripper, porn star, woman from, you know, adult magazines type woman.  Kind of funny.  Kind of funny. 
[02:52:00]  And this was to One Direction, the event.  Right.  That was just going to be children and families and stuff like that.  Okay.  Which, okay, look, it is funny.  Kind of funny.  You can't deny that much.  But they then looked at the sheet with all the guest lists of all the guests and noticed the name and was like, hey, who's that?  Who is Danny bringing?  And then they checked, did a little research, and found that this was indeed a porn star.  And this all went down over the course of about 12 hours because Danny, we found out that Danny won, all of us together, and celebrated on Thursday before the event was on Friday. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Very, very quick turnover here.  So they checked, and there was going to be trouble.  They did not want this stripper going.  So apparently they called Danny in for a meeting in the big boss's office.  Well, not the big, big boss, but Scott's office. 
[02:53:00]  And what was Scott's quote?  What was Scott's quote about his meeting with Danny?  He didn't give it to me.  This could be perhaps the most disrespectful person I've ever spoken to in my entire professional career.  Did he say that?  Yes.  What?  Yes.  Danny said that about Scott?  No, Scott said that about Scott.  Yes, yeah.  And that's the thing he talked to Scott Rudin before, that dude.  Yeah, yeah.  Just so it's all on the table, I got yelled at by Scott because he thought we had something to do it with it. 
[02:53:30]  And then he said, look, you guys got, it's weird to say it today, but he said, you guys got bullets.  You can't use them here.  He wouldn't even listen.  He was so fucking pissed off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just so it's all on the fucking table.  I've had my negative interactions with Scott about other stuff, but when talking to him, I never, it's like, you know, I still recognize that he's, and again, I didn't see this interaction with Danny, but it's like, Scott is the president of the company.  And there were times where I was fucking furious at him, but it's like, I know he can can me. 
[02:54:00]  Like, even though Opie and Anthony would try to protect, like, I understand that ultimately, Scott can do that.  Like, and that always kind of kept me from going crazy.  Just so everyone knows, over the years, we've saved a lot of fucking people.  Yeah.  And then they fucking blew their second, third, fourth.  There's one guy we saved so many fucking times, and they finally had to can him, and he's still holding a fucking grudge to this day.  When we had nothing to do with his firing, this guy fucking lied to a fucking lawyer, and I was told at the time, you can't save this person anymore. 
[02:54:30]  He's gone, and there's nothing we can do about it.  He was saved many, many fucking times.  Many times, and we all know it.  So.  But anyway.  Well, in this case.  So with the Danny, you.  Yeah.  He said it was the most disrespected he's ever been.  He's ever been in his professional career.  And that includes everything that you guys have said on the air?  Everything.  He said to me, in a very harsh tone, because I didn't even realize he listened, to be honest with you, he goes,  even when you, he pointed me out, even when you were motherfuckering me, this was way worse. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, man.  Wow.  I go, even when you were doing that shit on the air.  I heard he said in a very stern voice, I don't like this guy.  Very stern.  Got it.  Yes.  Wow.  Yeah.  So that's what I got.  Now, I wasn't in the meeting.  I have no idea.  I wasn't either.  What transpired.  This certainly allowed Danny to voice his side of this.  I heard tell.  He's not here.  Yeah, I don't think so. 
[02:55:30]  He's not allowed in the building.  I heard tell.  Certainly get him on the phone maybe tomorrow or something.  There was hands, interlocked fingers behind the head, lean back in a chair, legs crossed, indignant to the situation.  Well, that's just what I heard.  I'm just saying what I heard.  I definitely, it's like you look at this, it's like, okay, I understand why Danny would be annoyed because they said it's a plus one.  It's not like she's going to do anything crazy. 
[02:56:00]  But the company goes, all right, look, there's a lot of kids going to be there.  Like, there was probably a better way for them to approach it and say, look, man, we understand that you won, but could you?  And I imagine that they were a little bit more adamant than they probably had to be.  Well, from what I heard, he wasn't going to be fired until after the meeting.  Oh, why would it be?  They would never fire you for a season.  Bring a girl thing is one thing, but you could just say, ah, I was trying for something.  Well, you could just say that she's a friend of mine.  You could say, you know what, she does that for a living, she's a friend of mine, she's not going to misbehave.  You could also say, look, I'm on the Opie and Anthony radio show. 
[02:56:30]  I thought I could do this, perhaps it was bad judgment, but I thought I could bring just, she wasn't going to do anything, but just bringing this girl to a One Direction show.  Bailey J would have been the better choice, but that's just my.  Yeah.  But no one would, you know, well, yeah.  Believe me, no one would know.  Then what, Scott rescinded the offer, I guess?  Well, once he said he was disrespected, that was it. 
[02:57:00]  Then all bets were off.  Oh, no, before that, though, he rescinded the offer.  He went back in and said, look, you know, I don't want you taking.  Yes, yes, yes.  And then there was some heated discussion.  And that was that.  So they, I got a phone call.  Yeah, by the way.  Actually, I didn't even get a phone call.  I got, I got like, I think Ange told me.  Yeah, I didn't hear from anybody.  How did Ange find out?  I guess through Danny or something.  They didn't tell you at all?  No, they didn't tell me, but, but I did have a message. 
[02:57:30]  I've given, I've given Bladder my new phone number probably 10 times.  And I, I check my old phone every once in a while if I see it laying around.  And there it is, you know, Steve Bladder.  Well, we all got message.  We all got phone calls over the weekend.  Yeah, I think I must have gotten that on my old phone.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was, I actually got a text from Danny.  I was in bed.  I woke up late and heard Bladder's message.  He called me, but I had already gotten there.  From the pillow next to you? 
[02:58:00]  I'm applying you were sleeping.  No, I understood, but we really weren't sleeping because he kept farting on my dick.  Yeah, so anyway, that's pretty much the, uh, the story.  And then, um, a couple of days later, uh, Danny and, uh, D-Boy.  Remember Derek?  Hmm?  Remember Derek?  Come on.  D-Boy.  Yeah, they came over the house.  We were just fucking drinking, laughing, smashing the company. 
[02:58:30]  Were they laughing at you?  Uh, for being employed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  There you go.  Yep.  Lost another one.  Derek is, um, over at, uh, Rockstar, uh, video games.  Everyone's asking over here.  Where'd Derek go?  What happened to Derek?  And people were also, I don't know if people just don't listen to the show or don't understand  the way the show works after all these years.  Uh-huh.  After I said on the after show that he got fired and it was your story to tell, people  were insisting that this was obviously, like, a bit. 
[02:59:00]  A bit?  Like, that this was, like, a cliffhanger.  Nah.  Nah, real life is way better than bits these days.  That's pretty much, uh...  These days.  That's pretty much the truth.  That's exactly what happened there.  Now you know.  Everybody's like, oh, what happened?  The more you know.  That's what happened.  Um, got another song.  Oh.  I thought.  Yeah.  It's the end of the year.  A lot of end of the year, uh, in review shit going down, right?  I love those shows. 
[02:59:30]  What happened in the year?  And then you go, oh, that was this year.  Did you guys send out for some, uh, goldfish?  Yes.  Where the fuck are they?  Where are the goldfish?  We got them?  Oh, come on, man.  Oh, man.  Maybe they're hard to find.  Go to the motherfucking goldfish store!  Specialty item?  Who'd you send?  The intern?  Oh, gosh.  Oh, he's probably bungling around right now.  He's probably in the fucking, he's probably in a newsstand trying to buy them.  He's an idiot.  He's picking up twigs.  He's like Edgar.  Ah, Edgar.  Juicy-lipped Edgar.  So we got the, uh, 2012 year in review parody song. 
[03:00:00]  This thing is amazing.  All right, let's give it a listen.  You like it?  I'm ready.  Yeah, I believe this is going to go viral.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, when's the world supposed to end?  21st?  Yeah.  Friday.  We should start the...  Friday?  This Friday?  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  Shit's going down.  Check that out.  Guess we should start raping.  A little rape and pillage?  A little pillage.  We should start that.  Do you know, I remember growing up and, uh...  Three days out, I think we should start that if the world's going to end.  Yeah.  They had the end of the world things years ago when I was a kid. 
[03:00:30]  Remember, it's like, oh, the world's supposed to end today at noon.  How did that shit spread around, like, then, without the intra-tubes?  Word of mouth.  That's crazy.  That's the only way.  Because it was everywhere.  And a little phone action.  Yeah.  What was a problem getting something spread around back then?  You know, it's, uh, Jesus that is presenting, uh, preventing us from raping.  Why is that?  Well, we're worried about the afterlife now.  Three days before the end of the world, we're not raping because of Jesus.  Jesus. 
[03:01:00]  Or whoever you believe in.  I'm not raping because of jail.  Not even because of the moral implications.  Oh, you don't want to spend the last three, uh, days of your life in jail?  Somehow, I'm not banking on the fact that the world's going to end.  Oh, oh, oh, I see.  It's like, ah-ha, I'd be laughing at the cops going, what are you, go, yeah, yeah, throw  me in jail.  Well, the world's going to end in three days.  Oh, I see.  What am I going to do, a day?  Oh, they'll be on an interview in 15 years going, I seriously thought the world was going  to end.  I'm in my prison fucking garb.  Yeah, it's been tough. 
[03:01:30]  You know there'll be one case.  You think?  That comes forward, and that will be the defense.  Look, when you start raping, if you thought the world was going to end, the media said  the world's going to end on the 21st.  What would you do?  Meh.  Mark this.  We're going to have one case.  That's going to be the defense.  Somebody had a rape.  We'll go for something like that.  So this song is terrific.  It's a parody.  Do we know who did this? 
[03:02:00]  Some YouTube channel, some kind of comic.  Yes, it's amazing.  Something or other.  I think we should spread this around.  It's called This Is 2012.  All right.  You might recognize the song he does it to as well.  This is 2012.  Oh, no.  2012.  I'm just listening, man.  Man sings his heart out in the back of a police car.  Obama wins election.  Two states vote for marijuana.  Whitney Houston, rest in peace. 
[03:02:30]  Lance Armstrong is a cheat.  And finally, LeBron James wins one for the Miami Heat.  Tony 2012.  Kate Upton, Cat Daddy.  There is no more NHL.  Kitty Holmes and Tom Cruise split up.  Do I even care?  Johan's no header for the match.  Only took 50 years.  One of my worst fears.  Mark Taylor.  Melronik is not impressed with you or me.  Kate Middleton is pregnant. 
[03:03:00]  I can't believe George Lucas sold.  Out of tears.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  This was 2012.  2012.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  I literally waited a minute to fucking push this.  Oh, my God. 
[03:03:30]  Shit.  It's not even a third over.  Oh, is that horrible?  Here's something.  Every other word you don't understand.  No.  How much of that song did you hear?  A couple of things.  That you understood.  Every once in a while you heard, like, Tom Cruise I heard.  Yeah, Kate Middleton being pregnant.  Heard that.  Half the stuff I don't even know what he was saying.  Oh, Maroney, yeah.  But even the way he said that.  I only recognize the name.  Shit people say he was in 2012. 
[03:04:00]  2012.  2012.  I have no idea what he said there.  Hey, wait a minute.  Oh, that's why you brought it to our attention?  What?  You're in the video?  Oh, my God.  Oh, Sam.  Sam.  Ew.  Apple 5 is part of the parody.  I thought we were just looking at the year in review. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, Sam.  Oh, you self-serving shithead.  I thought we were just, you know, having fun.  You're blushing, too.  What's wrong with you?  Looking at the year in review.  Look, he turned red.  I know.  I wish that because his brains were shot out.  Fucking douchey, Sam.  Who knew?  Oh, forget it.  I'm not playing any more of this.  Self-serving.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Alert humble brag.  We got one in the studio.  iPhone 5.  We got a humble bragger.  What did they say about you in the song?  And worthless videos that go viral and the guy still doesn't go anywhere. 
[03:05:00]  I'm going.  Nappy-headed zilches.  I can't say that.  It's racist.  That video slowed down a little bit?  Well, I mean...  What did it tap out at?  Five.  Exactly.  Five and a half million.  Big deal.  No one cares about you.  So jealous.  Fuck.  Oh, man.  Jim doesn't have five and a half million.  Yeah, but what Jim has is a good heart.  That's sweet.  We're going to take a quick break and finish up the show after Dee's messages. 
[03:05:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That Steven Singer is brilliant.  I didn't even have to look at the copy.  I just know, because of the lack of music behind me, that it's got to be Steven Singer.  See, Steven wanted to set himself apart from everyone else by not having music, so that  it catches your ear easier.  That's how brilliant Steven is.  Speaking of brilliant, his diamonds are brilliant. 
[03:06:00]  Get away from me, Edgar.  Fuck.  I hate Edgar.  He scratches.  It's terrible.  I've been scratched by a tiger.  It wasn't this bad.  I swear, he's awful.  Gives me goosey bumps.  I hate Edgar.  Edgar's intrusive on my space.  Fuck, that's great. 
[03:06:30]  Do that one.  Uh, we got some officers outside the studio.  I want to give them a few minutes here, man, because they're doing something really, really  good for our community.  Yes, they're doing good work. 
[03:07:00]  I know you heard me just say that, but yeah, we do have fucking hearts.  Gentlemen.  Hello, sirs.  Good morning.  Hey, guys.  Big fans of the show.  Stop by and stop by to thank us.  I don't know why you're thanking us.  You guys are doing all the real work.  Heavy lifting.  Yeah, absolutely.  Why don't you explain to everyone who you are and what's going on?  We're from the Union Police Department in Union, New Jersey, and we just did probably  the biggest toy jive in the state.  That's great.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Pretty kick-ass.  Christmas coming around. 
[03:07:30]  You know, a lot of poor little tater tots ain't got no toys.  But you said the biggest.  How big?  Like a couple, I don't know, pickup trucks maybe?  We shoot our horn here.  We did two 18-wheelers, and we've got about two more trailers coming.  Wow.  Yeah, that's a lot.  We just went out there and just hit everybody with this thing.  And who are you helping out?  This is going to the Ocean County Sheriff's Department, and they're going to be giving  it out throughout the entire shore.  Oh, that's very cool.  Yeah.  They need something down there.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, you think, right?  Yeah.  So how can people give? 
[03:08:00]  Well, this is what I've been doing, and I'm giving out my phone number, 973-332.  You're giving out your phone number?  Absolutely.  This is the only way to get it done, you know?  Do you understand we have a lot of assholes to listen to us?  I hear you.  And after this week, it'll probably be changed.  If it's a cop, don't be stupid.  Yeah, please.  But you know what it is?  Do the right thing.  It's already out there.  All right, go ahead.  You know, it's the only way to get it out there.  Yeah.  It's 973-332-1556.  I just increased my minutes, so don't worry about it.  Yeah.  We don't leave it.  No, our listeners step up.  They know the difference. 
[03:08:30]  They really do.  You know, there is still a lot of people out there, just thousands.  I just got a call from Seaside Heights and all the people down there,  and it's devastated.  Yeah, yeah.  This is bad.  You know what?  How bad?  What have you seen personally?  I didn't even go down there.  I had no time.  Once we started doing this, and like I said, I just want to thank you guys.  You have no idea.  This has gone to the top.  I've gotten calls from all different networks.  Really?  Going on different shows just to get the word out there.  Every time I go on a show, I tell the people I'm getting 20,000 toys.  I mean, that's how I see it.  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  It's pretty cool.  Is there a website too, or they just got a call you?  We just put it on Facebook.  Facebook, simple as that.  We just went on Facebook and started getting the word out there, and it just exploded.  With Facebook, so people can do that.  Just an event.  We call it Santa in Blue Project, and people just actually joined it up, and the word went  out there.  Great.  We're actually extended it because it's gotten so big.  Yeah.  We went to January 7th.  Oh, wow.  Really?  We're just going to keep it going.  Why not?  Might as well.  Yeah.  It's like a couple of days late.  Did you say you had 100 and how many bikes? 
[03:09:30]  118 or something?  Oh, no, no.  We had about 300 or 400 bicycles.  Wow.  Jesus.  That alone.  Wow.  You know, people are just stepping it up, you know?  The word just came out there, you know?  Once we started getting people, like celebrities, to pass the word on, it just kept going.  There's not one person that turned us down.  That's great, man.  It's awesome, you know?  So what's the number again?  Let's give a really good plug.  My wife's going to kill me.  People can call for a good cause for Sandy victims.  Don't be dicks.  I mean, this is, you know, it's like a real thing. 
[03:10:00]  You don't be assholes.  It's 973, I'm sorry, 973-332-1556.  And you could send me an email.  It's mbowl, uniontownship.com.  How do you spell mbowl?  M-B-O-L-L.  M-B-O-L-L at?  Uniontownship.com.  Okay.  So good.  It's a good cause.  You can give.  Great, man.  Absolutely.  Yeah, one of the things we wanted to do was to personally thank you.  Oh, my question.  I'm the whore here.  I want to grab all the time.  Because you guys were the first ones that actually stepped up and helped support us. 
[03:10:30]  We were told we were getting a piece of the final cut.  I was told I could have a couple of bicycles.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, just take the seats off first.  Thank you, guys.  We are expecting our taste, aren't we, guys?  You must allow us to wet our beaks.  Right.  Our beaks.  Well, thank you very much, guys.  Thank you, guys.  This is a great opportunity for us to get the word out there, you know?  Absolutely.  Thanks again.  No bullshit.  After all this nice crap, you've got to get back out there and rouse people.  You know what, though? 
[03:11:00]  But people have been stepping up even after what happened.  You know, they just want to do the right thing.  I've got to tell you, that Seaside Heights, I know the devastation.  I definitely feel for it.  But that roller coaster looked like shit anyway.  It looked like the crappiest fucking roller coaster.  It might have been time.  They're going to go with some really nice one now.  Did they take it out of the ocean yet?  No, I think they're going to keep it there.  It's just going to sit there.  It's just going to keep it in the ocean.  I think they're going to try and make it like a landmark or something.  Oh, wow.  That's kind of weird.  I'm just happy that the midway was okay, you know?  Yeah, there you go.  That will bring people down to see it.  I mean, fuck.  I haven't been to Seaside in years. 
[03:11:30]  I'd go to see the roller coaster in the ocean.  I don't know.  I don't think they're going to get that thing out of there right now.  True.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  How far in is it?  I wouldn't even know.  Yeah.  That's so fucked up.  How are we going to really start to even think about moving that thing out?  I know, right?  It'd be a waste of money.  There's really no reason to.  And it is a piece of history.  It'll eventually fall over, I'm sure.  Yeah.  A thousand years.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  I'm just saying things.  My mouth opened and nonsense flies out of it.  Along with AIDS.  Why did I say that? 
[03:12:00]  Man, that's just mean.  He's not a nice guy.  This is a toy driver talking about, right?  Yeah, really?  What the hell?  I know, right?  Separate the two for a little while.  My chief's listening.  Thinking.  Oh, hi, chief.  Hi.  Chief.  All right, so you got the phone number and you got the email address.  So honestly, give what you can because it's for people who had a tremendously awful thing happen.  And now get the hell out of here.  Like I say, guys.  Thank you very much, guys.  We appreciate it.  Have a good week.  Have a good week.  Yeah, definitely.  We always support the fucking cops.  Yeah.  Somebody's got it, right? 
[03:12:30]  Yes.  Jimmy, what do you got, buddy?  Thanks, gents.  You got anything?  Oh, plugs.  I got New Year's Eve in Buffalo, the Healing Comedy Club, the 28th through 31st.  And February 14th, I will be in, oh, God, Atlantic City with Artie, Amy Schumer, and David Tell.  Dave's in tomorrow.  That's going to be great.  Yeah, it's a good show.  Annual trip to AC.  I look forward to it.  Yeah, me too.  It's a different weekend this year because they were doing a big poker tournament. 
[03:13:00]  And then, you know, in January, I'm in San Diego, and I'm in Nashville.  So my website's going to be up soon.  You know, you can just check my Twitter or whatever.  It's easy to find me.  This Sunday, by the way, this Sunday, we figured we'd do it again.  Rotgut.  Me, brother Joe, Joe Curry, Fred.  Going to have some fun with Rotgut this Sunday.  It's 89 North Music Venue in Patchogue. 
[03:13:30]  That's what it's called.  89 North Music Venue.  Doors open at 730.  Also, Almost Journey is playing that night.  And to you.  Wow.  So it's tribute band and Rotgut night at 89 North Music Venue in Patchogue.  I guess 89 North Music Venue.com.  Is that the old porn theater?  For all the info.  Patchogue?  I don't think so.  Right, Patchogue?  I'm not sure where it is.  Oh, I know it.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm not too sure.  I just know. 
[03:14:00]  Whatever.  But Dad put on a show there for the VA.  Yeah.  I know where it is now.  I got confused with the one in Bayshore?  Yeah, Bayshore was the Porn Theater.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jimmy played the porn theater.  That's when he first told me that your wife was pregnant.  Yeah.  In that porn theater.  And Jimmy gave me a fantastic hug.  Yeah, it's good news.  We touched helmets and everything.  That's Sunday, by the way.  So it's this Sunday.  Yes.  Join us.  Have fun.  Very good.  With that, we'll see you tomorrow with David Tell and Judd Apathe.  We'll see you tomorrow with David Tell from This Is 40.  Wow. 
[03:14:30]  That's it.  Chop, chop.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  Continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Here he is.  Here he is.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live, of course.  866-WOW1-WOW.  It's the phone number to call.  I got in trouble after yesterday's show.  You remember yesterday, I had Opie in here, and we were getting down to brass tacks. 
[03:15:00]  Greg Hughes was coming out of his shell a little bit and talking about, you know, raising his  kid and the way he was raised and everything.  I think I hurt my dad's feelings when I said he was a disciplinarian.  You know, when I, because I, Opie said that a lot of fathers are, you know, they're just  disciplinarians.  And I said that, yeah, my dad was far stricter than most and everything.  What's this guy calling?  You can come in.  Come on in.  Cops are pointing at something.  I'll tell you in a second. 
[03:15:30]  The cops are outside.  Help them with the door, Anthony.  They're America's finest.  What's up, guys?  Oh, cool, yeah.  We brought this in for the staff.  Come on in.  We gave them the card, so I don't know if you want to get in.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, yeah.  We've got shirts.  We've got some bags in here for you guys.  Oh, my God.  Thanks, guys.  You want to plug your thing one more time before you go?  That's right.  One more time.  If you want, might as well, right?  We're in the after show with Sam Roberts.  That's right.  I'll put this on the couch.  Okay, cool, man.  Thank you guys so much.  We've got an hour.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, we're on. 
[03:16:00]  Different show or just go ahead and talk here?  Yeah, no.  I'm, yeah.  Everyone's hearing you.  All right.  Pretty cool.  My name's Sam.  Sam.  And I host the after show.  My name's Sam Roberts.  All right, Sam.  This is me.  Mike Boll from the Union Police Department.  No, but they heard.  Ah, because that sounds how intelligent I am right now.  Right, no, because they heard.  The after show, which means is that they heard everything.  Right, they just heard us before.  And I'm just going to just talk about the same thing wouldn't make any sense.  It's strange because it doesn't make any sense at all.  It's a very loose format.  Yeah, I got you.  But still, I figure you still don't want to plug it.  Yeah, no, absolutely. 
[03:16:30]  Like I said, we're looking for like gift cards right now and anything like that because  we're getting stuff from all over the place.  That's what works best.  The best thing to do is to get gift cards to us.  What kind of spots?  Like gift cards from anywhere?  From anywhere.  Anywhere.  We'll take them from anywhere.  Cool.  Just as long as they can get them out as soon as possible.  And how can they get them to you?  They can just mail them to us at 981 Caldwell Avenue in Union, New Jersey.  That's 9.  That's 9 Township Police Department.  Yeah.  Intention Sergeant Bowl, B-O-L-L.  All right, cool.  Send out the gift cards ASAP because it's helping everybody who needs it. 
[03:17:00]  No, absolutely, yeah.  Who needs it.  There's thousands of people, man.  There's thousands that don't have homes and anything right now.  They're living in Army barracks right now.  It's crazy because we don't see it.  So we don't even know it's still happening because around us, everything's fine.  Like we were talking about the 12-12-12 concert.  We were making fun of Ben Stiller because Ben Stiller is like answering calls.  And he goes, yeah, you know, a lot of people are devastated.  I know where we live in Westchester.  We lost power for like four days.  Yeah.  And it's like, yeah, well, you know what?  There's just homes laying in the ocean right now. 
[03:17:30]  Exactly.  And you don't worry about that.  And that's what you guys are taking care of, right?  Yeah.  Cool, man.  It's actually when you know some of the people, too.  You do?  Yeah.  A couple of our people we know.  Well, Iraq in there, a couple of his, what was it?  Iraq, you're in there, right?  I can't see you on the monitor.  Yeah, I'm here.  Yeah.  Your sister and brother both lost houses, right?  They're physically standing, but the whole houses were trashed.  Yeah.  Really bad.  And where are they staying now?  They got apartments in Brooklyn right now, temporarily, probably for the next six months 
[03:18:00]  to a year.  So are they, for a year?  Yeah, people can't go back for months.  The streets aren't safe.  Plus, you're going right into the winter.  It's hard to do, you know, outdoor construction and everything.  You just got to kind of strip it down and seal it off and winterize it until you can work  on it again.  Wow, so there are like whole areas.  These people aren't going back to their homes for months, and this stuff is just going to  get moldy and just ruin their homes.  And that's where all their stuff is, too.  They can't go back there.  It's not safe.  The gas lines are all messed up.  And it's just a hazard just for even them going on the streets there.  And nobody knew it was coming, so it's not like they could pack their shit up and go, 
[03:18:30]  you know, like everything is still in their houses.  These people lost everything, man.  It's insane.  And you can't go back to even, they went one time, I think, for like two hours or a day,  half a day to pick up their stuff by bus.  Two were allowed to go suitcase side to grab your belongings and go home.  Yeah, Eric was saying that his brother, it was your brother, right, that had water up  to his second story of his house?  The second story of the house, yeah.  Man.  It's crazy, man.  And this is just one of, God, I mean, I think they said like 275,000 homes all together 
[03:19:00]  throughout the entire storm.  Some crazy number like that.  Oh, my God.  It's just wildfire.  It's crazy.  But once New York got the lights back on, a lot of the news coverage kind of stopped.  Yeah.  And people kind of forget that it's happening.  But, all right, so what's the address one more time?  It's 981 Caldwell Avenue in Union, New Jersey, and it's Attention Sergeant Bowl, B-O-L-L.  Cool.  Send all, like, gift cards and stuff there.  Yeah.  That's great, man.  Thanks for this time and this opportunity.  Once again, this is going down to Ocean County Sheriff's Department in New Jersey, and they're 
[03:19:30]  actually distributing out the toys for us to all these victims and their families.  Oh, perfect.  So, we appreciate everything that you guys have done.  For sure, man.  Yeah, of course.  Thanks for stepping up.  Great.  No, thank you guys.  We didn't do anything.  We just sat here and talked about it.  It's like I said, two 18-wheelers full of toys and a couple trailers, so that's not  too bad at all.  Yeah, over 10,000 toys being delivered.  Awesome.  Yeah.  It's really cool.  Well, yeah, thank you guys for stopping by.  All right, man.  Thanks again.  I'm an honor, man.  Thanks.  You, too.  Thanks for bringing the gear and stuff over.  All right.  It's safe, guys.  Thank you.  So, you're a...  Oh, thanks, man.  Good to meet you.  You, too, dude. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  You, too.  So, E-Rock, they're just stuck in the apartment?  Yeah.  My brother goes to work at 5.30 in the morning, gets done about 5.30 in the evening, drops  his stuff off, and then goes out to the house to work on the house until he just can't work  on it anymore and goes to bed.  So, he's out there every day.  Wait.  Tell me again.  He goes to work and then after work?  Yeah.  They have the apartments, right?  Right.  He goes to work in the morning, puts in 12 hours, drops his stuff off, then goes out 
[03:20:30]  to the house to work on the house.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Because he's just trying to get...  He wants to get back there as soon as he can.  Yeah.  In fact, as we were saying earlier, I had a lot of family and stuff over the weekend for  an early Christmas stuff, and he didn't come because he was still working on the house,  waiting on deliveries and whatnot.  He was still there.  And they're not...  Like, do you think that they're going to be able to get the houses habitable again?  His house, definitely.  Most of his neighborhood, I can see doing that. 
[03:21:00]  But as you get closer towards the beachfront, it's only about two blocks from where he is,  is the actual beach where the houses are on.  I don't think a lot of those people are rebuilding those houses.  Yeah.  They may just sell it and demolish it or just let them just sit there.  Well, like I said, I mean, half the houses don't even exist.  They're in the ocean.  Cool, man.  Well, yeah, hopefully people help them out with that stuff.  I was saying before...  And that's what I wanted to ask you.  Do you have, like, little cousins over your house?  Is that why you have so many treats? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Like little nephews and stuff?  All the time.  That's what I...  Because I was like, I knew that I was missing something.  I knew that there was no way that you and your wife just had closets full of cookies.  I was like, there has to be some kind of little kids involved.  We've got that.  We've got the, you know, the...  They look like Capri Suns, but they're apple juice and grape juice, stuff like that.  Do you normally have that amount of snacks when it's just you two?  Of different varieties.  Not of those varieties, but for me, yes.  What do you like?  Like, what are the snacks that you hold dear?  You know what I've been eating a lot lately? 
[03:22:00]  Like, that you don't let the nephews touch?  No, no, no.  Those are Uncle Eric's snacks.  I found Australian licorice.  It's great.  What's Australian licorice?  It's these...  I don't know how to put it.  They're big chunks of licorice that's imported from Australia.  It's really good.  Do they taste different from regular, like, American licorice?  Yeah, they don't taste like Twizzlers or Red Vines or anything like that.  They're really good.  Well, your snack palate is very refined.  Yeah. 
[03:22:30]  So at this point, you know...  I'm importing snacks now.  I don't do domestic anymore.  352.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  What's your name?  Hey, this is John.  You are the greatest broadcaster ever, Sam Roberts.  Oh, thank you very much, John.  Well, I learned that Danny's cocky attitude may have gotten him fired.  I told you it was a good story and that you guys would just have to wait.  And the reason I brought up on the air today when they were telling the Danny story finally,  the reason at the end I brought up that so many people were asking about whether it was a bit or not 
[03:23:00]  was because, like, I can't imagine...  I don't remember in seven years ever doing a bit.  Like, I don't think we've ever actually pulled off a bit on that level.  Like, we've never said something just to hold the audience captive.  It's always true.  We always just kind of say what's going on.  Am I wrong, Eric?  You're the...  I think it could also be, too, people might have been thinking that we're so close to Christmas,  it could have been he's just taking his vacation time. 
[03:23:30]  But why would we say he was fired?  Like, is that funny?  They've said it in the past.  I guess.  When there's been days where Danny was off or away or something like that,  they would joke that he was fired.  But, you know, I guess if you say it too much, nobody really believes it.  The boy who cried wolf is that tale.  That's what Dr. Steve's saying.  He's saying candy for all of us when you receive candy.  Which, by the way, Dr. Steve's been texting me all upset.  Did we get a gift for the staff?  Well, here's what I want to know.  This is the thing. 
[03:24:00]  You went on the air when Opie and Anthony were talking about their gifts.  Oh, I know where you're going with this.  And you said Dr. Steve sent you a tower of boxes of chocolates.  Yeah, it's called the Sweet and Salty Tower.  You enjoy it?  I actually haven't eaten anything from it yet.  My family has, though.  And that was sent to you?  It was sent to me and my wife.  At your home?  Yes.  This isn't a Daily News lottery situation?  No, I did not take it. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, no, I didn't take it from here.  Nor did I do that with the lottery.  Well, no, that's debatable.  But, why is Dr. Steve sending you special things and the rest of us just get something to share?  He gave us each a dick in the ass.  That's right.  We all get a dick in the ass and we all have to fight and scav...  Well, whatever.  Maybe he doesn't have your new address.  Whatever.  I've been living in the same apartment for two years.  Oh.  He texts us.  He can text, hey, Sam, what's your address?  What's your address?  Wow.  I was going to say that we all have to pick and scavenge through whatever we can get as a shared staff. 
[03:25:00]  But there's so few of us now, we keep losing staff members.  I guess it's not that much to share.  But still.  It's the principal.  You walk by.  Hey, give me that.  All right.  He says he sent something up to the office.  I'm trying to remember if we saw it or not.  You know what?  We haven't, first of all.  There hasn't been anything sent to the office.  And regardless of that, I don't want what was sent to the office.  Because that's not fair.  That's communal?  That's, well, yeah.  What's he sending a communal thing for and then sending you something special? 
[03:25:30]  Why do you get something special?  Because I take care of his show on the weekend, maybe?  No, you don't.  Sal does, and he doesn't even do it right.  No, I do it.  No, Sal covered for me that one time, and he didn't do it right.  He fucked it up, didn't he?  Yeah, I was.  What do you mean take care of his show?  You just load it.  I build it, load it.  What do you have to do to build it?  I put the production around it.  Okay, and it's the same production every week, isn't it?  Oh, yes.  So you throw it into the show.  Hey, you're looking for a reason.  I don't have one.  I'm just throwing stuff out there.  How come Dr. Steve is sending Eric special gifts?  I don't know why he's sending Eric special gifts, 
[03:26:00]  but I do know something that you and I are going to benefit from, Sam.  What's that?  I was speaking to Dr. Steve, and the staff gift is still on its way.  Okay.  It will be delivered on Friday.  Okay.  When only you and I are here.  Are you and I the only staff members here on Friday?  Yeah.  I'm here.  Oh, that's...  Well, yeah, you and I are the only...  Well, staff members, yeah.  I mean, of course, we need an intern, but yeah.  Only staff members.  Oh, well, shall I pick it up for the messenger center?  Sal, you can run down and pick up the box for us, and we'll enjoy the sweets. 
[03:26:30]  That's not nice.  I know, that's not nice, but it's the way of the world, isn't it?  You and I will have a nice little Christmas present.  That's going to be great.  You and I will take off our shoes and pants, and we'll just sit in the office feeding each  other chocolates from Dr. Steve.  That Sal will get from the mail room.  Yes, and Sal will massage our feet as we're eating the chocolates.  I like that idea.  It's a Friday before vacation.  It's what we do here at the LNA show.  Are you taking the place of Danny massaging Travis?  Is that...  That is something...  I don't know who it was a shot at.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[03:27:00]  It wasn't really shot at all.  The tonality of it, Eric, you're right, was very shot-like.  You were right to call that out, but I'm not sure who it was a shot at.  Are you...  Travis, are you missing the massages, the physical intimacy that you'd get from Danny  now that he's gone?  That position is open, but it's going to be tough to fill.  I'll bet it will, but you're tight, aren't you?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I mean, is it...  Did you feel lonely in the office without your butt-buddy Danny? 
[03:27:30]  I mean, I don't know if that's what you called each other.  We never had intercourse.  Specifically, I mean...  Oh.  At the office.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because that's wrong.  Mm-hmm.  I learned that from Seinfeld.  And you can still have, I guess, physical intimacy outside the office.  Yeah, sure.  Okay, good, good, good.  Nothing saying you can do that.  Yesterday, Troy and DeRosa was threw down at Caroline's.  What?  Troy and DeRosa.  At the Caroline's party.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  What the...  Intimacy.  Troy has got to be pissed at that, because Travis and me are just talking about Danny. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, but Roland's like, you know what?  This conversation does not interest me at all.  And Roland goes, yeah, it's like, for instance, Troy and DeRosa almost got into a fight at  the Caroline's holiday party last night.  So would you say, in your professional opinion...  Did you just say Jew?  Yes.  Would Jew say?  Oh.  That's messed up.  That Danny and I are having sex outside of the office is just like Troy and Joe DeRosa  throwing down at the Caroline's Christmas party.  Sort of.  Literally, those two things have nothing in common.  It was awesome. 
[03:28:30]  Wait, what?  Did you hear what happened in here, Eric?  I was just...  Before Sal came in, I was doing the phones.  Well, I was talking...  Do you want a fight?  I was talking to Travis.  Yeah.  About Danny being fired from the show.  Yeah.  And whether Travis missed the physical intimacy, the massages he would get.  Yeah, I heard that part.  The weirdness of it all.  And then Roland turned around and he goes,  Yeah, like Joe DeRosa and Troy almost got into a fight at Caroline's last night.  You heard that just now, Troy.  Yeah, that's why I came in.  Am I wrong in thinking that the context was not there? 
[03:29:00]  No, he's just trying to bring that up.  Well, he succeeded, didn't he?  Yeah, and by the way, there was no close to almost being in a fight.  I know, but I was drunk.  Joe and I talked.  That's it.  I did see at one point...  I was drunk.  The Caroline's Christmas party was last night.  Yeah.  The comedy club.  And Joe DeRosa was there.  And Troy was there.  On Friday, you had some things to say about Joe DeRosa.  Yeah.  On the air.  Yeah.  After he left.  Yeah.  And I would have said I'm on the air if I was in the studio.  Right, right, right.  Well, yeah, sure.  You would have said it to his face, you mean?  Mm-hmm. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  I get there talking to Joe DeRosa.  I see your beautiful girlfriend and your other beautiful girlfriend.  I don't know what the relationship is there, but two beautiful girls walked in that are  associated with Troy.  And I go, oh.  And then Troy starts walking behind them.  And I go, oh.  Uh-oh.  Because right before Troy had gotten there, Joe DeRosa had been asking me and Roland about  you fucking with him.  Like, why is he fucking with me?  I go, I don't know.  I told him what you told me, which is you took some shots at him that one time. 
[03:30:00]  You guys got into the fight.  And he told me, for whatever reason, he cannot let it go.  Mm-hmm.  That's what you told me.  And so that's what I told him.  Mm-hmm.  That he can't let it go.  He just, he wants to, but he can't.  Right.  And he goes, what the fuck?  And then Troy walked in and walked over to the table.  And he looked at Joe and he goes, uh-oh, is this weird?  I go, yeah, it is.  And he goes, what's not for me?  And I go, yeah, it probably will be in a minute.  And then almost immediately, Joe took you, you know, to a corner privately. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  Troy didn't see me trying to let Joe on fire.  Yeah.  This is what, Roland was obviously intoxicated.  Because Joe, I think, was trying to seriously talk to you like, hey, dude, do we have a problem?  What the fuck is up?  And while he's doing that, Roland takes up the little teacup candle off the table.  I tried to let him on fire.  And starts waving it under Joe DeRosa's shirt tail going, whoo-hoo-hoo.  When Roland gets drunk, it's just like a free-for-all.  I mean, when he's sober, he has no semblance of context. 
[03:31:00]  No.  We learned that just now.  Yeah.  But then when he's drunk, it's even worse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I tried to let him on fire twice under his ass.  So, he brought you over to the corner.  Yeah.  We talked.  It's fine.  You guys had a private conversation.  Yeah.  Are you cool with Joe DeRosa?  Joe and I are fine.  I've heard that before.  This time, I'm fine.  Definitely fine.  Yeah.  Did he put you in your place?  Is that what happened?  No, we just talked.  Okay.  And you're-  Are you-  Can you let it go?  I can let it go.  I told him I have a real problem with- 
[03:31:30]  I can't forgive and forget real easy.  You can't.  I have a problem with that.  That's a personality defect of Troy.  Yeah.  Okay.  It is.  And it's like, if I have something against somebody, I will- I just go after them as long  as I can.  And the venom doesn't seep out of your veins.  It just doesn't stop.  Right.  And it just- as time goes on, I just get even more angry and I want more blood.  And what was it about Joe that had you that bloodthirsty?  Had.  Not have.  Had.  At that time.  Yes.  At that time, he- I was like, he had just taken a cheap shot just for a quick laugh. 
[03:32:00]  Right.  And you said, I'm not the lady to fuck with.  Yeah.  I mean, probably a different- you didn't say lady, I wouldn't think.  Right.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, but it was like- it was just one of those things and it was fine.  And then, you know, if you go after somebody, you would just think like, okay, well, this  person's going after me, I'll still go after them.  But he just wasn't going after me anymore.  So then it's like, you kind of-  Well, you kind of- he was kind of like, oh, look, Troy's got funny pants on and stuff. 
[03:32:30]  And you came in and you were like, fuck you, you're bad at your job.  And he was like, I didn't expect that reaction from you.  Well, I mean, look.  You did- you did in the- and I guess it's an old ONA saying because it's what they do  too.  You responded to gunfire with a cannon.  Yeah.  But it's just, you know, I mean, Roland will tell you this.  I mean, you just- if you let shit slide, you know, you just- you got to get ready to, you  know, have your asshole pumped out whenever- whenever somebody wants a good laugh.  Or me trying to burn you.  And that was- I don't know if that makes sense. 
[03:33:00]  And that was- but it's funny.  And that was your way of saying, uh, I will not be pumping semen out of my asshole anytime.  No.  My asshole is exit only.  Yeah.  And you better remember that, DeRosa.  Yeah.  But Joe and I are fine.  And now you're cool.  We're fine.  Everything's good.  Joe- Joe's fine.  And you're fine.  I'm fine.  I'm totally cool with Joe.  All right.  It's good to hear.  There wasn't an almost fight.  Not even close.  Not even close.  Did you at one point think, I might have to fight this motherfucker?  Never.  Never.  Not for one- Joe- Joe doesn't seem like a physical guy. 
[03:33:30]  I don't think so either.  No.  He's a comedian.  He talks for a living.  We shook hands and I hugged him.  You did hug him.  I did hug him.  Well, you hugged him last time too, and then you came in here and started talking shit again.  Yeah, because it just shit sat with me a little weird.  Do you think it's going to sit with you weird this time?  No.  We talked.  And you're clear.  Everything's in the clear.  Everything's in the clear.  Would you say Troy and Joe DeRosa are on the same page?  What do you mean?  Like, we're cool.  Yeah, we're cool.  What a Christmas miracle.  It really was.  It was a great party.  And that is.  That's the theme of a Christmas party, isn't it?  Yeah.  Togetherness.  It was fun. 
[03:34:00]  Not setting comedians on fire, Roland.  And the party was a lot of fun last night.  It was.  It was a great time.  Caroline always does it.  Greg Charles is the man.  Yeah, Greg called me.  He goes, fucking Troy.  That guy knows how to roll in.  Because he rolled in with two bitches.  I roll in with bitches.  Yeah.  I roll thick.  Your girlfriend told me she wasn't wearing any underwear.  She wasn't.  I believed her.  Well, she ripped homey that.  She ripped her stockings and she said, now I can't wear panties.  Yeah.  I said, that's fine by me.  Right.  I was just surprised that that was information that she gave me four minutes after her arrival.  Look. 
[03:34:30]  She just wanted to put all the cards on the table.  She's cool like that.  She just wanted to let you know what was going on.  And I was glad to know.  And then Katie Storm was there.  Right.  That's the chick whose Twitter we blew up a few months ago.  Yeah.  And she's just a badass bitch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Roland took a picture with both girls.  They're on his Instagram.  Rolando is 99.  Roland's a pimp.  Well, I mean, yeah.  He's a pimp with the chicks that you brought.  He's not like fucking these chicks.  Yeah, but you don't understand.  Like, like, Katie loves Roland.  Like, Katie works at Los Feliz.  And when Roland rolls it, comes in, she puts out the red carpet for him. 
[03:35:00]  Roland, I got your back on this one.  We hear from girls how much they love Roland all the time.  Yeah.  Will she put her hands on his genitals?  I don't know.  That's what we're looking for, isn't it, Roland?  Somebody.  Somebody.  Not her, necessarily.  She's cool.  But we'd like a woman to touch your genitals every now and then.  It's not always just, you know.  Well, I mean, she's downy.  That's fine.  As long as she has hands.  You don't mind if she has down syndrome?  I don't actually breathe, huh?  Okay.  He is single lady.  So if there are any attractive ladies out there.  With down syndrome? 
[03:35:30]  No.  No.  Roland just said that he was cool.  As long as she has hands.  Well, yeah.  Because we get better seats in the concerts and everything.  Good.  And parking is a breeze.  And out there parking like, hey, I can't afford a ticket.  Hey, wait, she has downy.  Front row.  People have questions about Danny.  That's the story.  I mean, aren't you glad the story finally broke?  Yeah.  Because it really is a funny story.  And honestly, Danny's a funny motherfucker.  So for him to go out like that, I mean, that's a good story.  Art, you're on the After Open Anthony Live show.  Hey, Sam. 
[03:36:00]  First of all, I just want to compliment you on being a highly talented, opportunistic shit-sterer.  It's a bad time somebody recognized that.  And I have two questions for you.  One, was it you that put the bug in Danny's ear to take the stripper to the One Direction event?  And B, was it yesterday or today that you will be asking for half of Danny's salary?  Well, I mean, Danny's not here, so he's not going to use any of it.  I'm not going to ask for half. 
[03:36:30]  I'll ask for the entire salary.  I think that's fair.  He's not here.  He's not using it anymore, unfortunately.  And I miss the guy.  But if he's not going to use the salary, I'd like to have it.  Secondly, no, I didn't try to convince him to take the porn star.  But we all laughed when we heard the idea.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It was a funny idea.  We all thought it was funny.  I mean, I don't know that all of us would have had the balls to do it.  No.  I probably wouldn't have had the balls to do it.  And if I did and I was confronted by a boss, I would have cowered and hid under the desk  and said, whatever you want, sir, whatever you want, sir. 
[03:37:00]  But that's the difference.  I'm a little bit of a pussy like that sometimes.  Wouldn't you love to see how it played out?  Like Ben in the meeting?  No, no, no.  As far as like...  Oh, if he had actually taken the porn star to one direction?  No.  I would have wanted to stay far away from it, probably.  I just want to hear the story.  But then that's the pussy thing, too.  Yeah.  Shining through.  Because that's the overarching thing here.  The reason I wouldn't have been able to pull something like that off is pussy.  Yeah.  You know?  Gina.  Hey, Sam.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Good. 
[03:37:30]  I have a question.  I want to know, how does Mars feel about Danny being fired?  Damn!  Mars is on another vacation.  It's hard to tell the difference when he's here or not.  But he is not here.  He's on the Spain schedule.  Through work three months, off three months.  But I think that...  I mean, I'm sure Mars doesn't want to see anybody go hungry, but Mars and Danny never had a great relationship.  Mars is probably happy.  He doesn't have to deal with him on a day-to-day basis.  I would think that's the diplomatic way to say it.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And maybe after the holiday break when Mars is back, you know, we'll ask him what he really thinks. 
[03:38:00]  I think they were sort of cool.  I don't know.  I can't speak for either of them, but I want to say that they were a little more cool at the end.  Well, Eric, do you have the Livewire movie trailer?  Yeah, hang on a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Play it.  We'll see if this sounds cool.  Not at that time.  Okay, because that's what we should play while we're talking about...  Mars is our engineer, and he had a bit of a rivalry with Danny.  Well, Danny had gotten into fights with everybody.  Yeah. 
[03:38:30]  I never got into a fight with Danny, I don't think.  I think you've come close, though.  Yeah, we were on really good terms at the end, is what we'll call it, which is a shame.  But, yeah, I mean, we've been on the outs before.  I know when he played the intern in Guitar Hero, and I represented the intern, I think he was getting pretty pissed at me,  because, I mean, I tend to talk, don't I?  Yeah.  But, yeah, I know he got into a fight with you.  Yeah.  A few fights.  Patrice.  Patrice.  That was legendary.  Little Nicky. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  That was probably the biggest on-air drama, and maybe...  Stirred by Patrice.  Yeah.  Do you have that Livewire, Eric?  Yeah.  This is Danny and Mars' history.  This is what came from their argument.  In a world where one vigilante engineer disregards the law of the land...  I love this one.  You and your rules.  Only the strong will survive.  I'm a much bigger man than you are.  Marcelino Centeno is...  We're gonna fight.  Livewire. 
[03:39:30]  I'm not afraid of your information.  Engineer or no engineer, Livewire looks to take down the bad guys at any cost.  You have a difficult personality, and you're an asshole.  But you're our engineer.  You could drop dead right now.  I wouldn't give a fuck.  Whining and complaining get you nowhere with Livewire.  I'm still waiting for a Christmas dinner from five years ago.  That's exactly my point, you stupid fuck.  Little dick motherfucker couldn't even get it hard.  No action adventure will get your blood boiling like this. 
[03:40:00]  Strap in, folks.  This is where it gets really exciting.  Because I'm the truth-sayer.  I want to see that movie.  That sounds action-packed.  I was just so happy to put a Motley Crue song into a production piece.  It's about time.  We've got enough of that.  And I'm glad that Danny's contributions will live on in ways like that.  Yep.  I said, real quick, I wanted to make my point. 
[03:40:30]  At the beginning of the show, I said my dad was pissed.  Because, did you hear the show yesterday, the after show?  I had an opium, and we were talking about it.  And I said my dad was just a disciplinarian.  And he emailed me.  And he goes, what, was it my turn under the bus?  I was like, I didn't think I was that bad.  I just said you were strict.  And he goes, you were never punished for that long.  And, you know, if I was just a disciplinarian, what about all those times I brought you and your friends to wrestling shows?  And I was like, Dad, like, you know, you obviously did a good job.  Look how I came out. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Like, you did fantastically.  I mean, wonderfully.  Secondly, like, if you're going to get, like, a little bit hurt by that, imagine what Mom goes through.  You know what I mean?  The shit that Mom's had to deal with on this show.  You have perfect parents.  Put things into context.  Thank you very much, Troy.  Is your mom going to make me a carrot cake before I leave tomorrow?  No.  Please?  No.  Tomorrow's Roland and I's last day, so hopefully your mom can make something.  They can carry cupcakes.  I don't think it's going to happen.  Why?  You don't think? 
[03:41:30]  Could you ask?  I mean, I'll talk to her about it, but again, I don't think this is...  Can she make the best carrot cupcakes?  And this is some of the parent bullying that went on at my birthday party that we talked about a couple months ago.  You guys are leaving to Vegas, right?  Yeah.  You're going with your girl, Troy.  Oh, yeah.  You may need some kind of last-minute gifts before you go.  Yeah, like a carrot cupcake.  No, not anything edible.  There's this really awesome device.  Actually, you guys each have one.  The Orb.  Yeah.  You know about this?  You plug it into a stereo.  It's a small little thing, and you plug it into any speaker or boombox, and it'll turn it into a portable SiriusXM internet player controlled by your smartphone or iPad.

Hey, what's going on, guys?  Not too much.  Happy holidays.  You too.  Hey, I got a question for Troy.  I, too, think that DeRosa is kind of unfunny.  The only thing funny about him is his curious George head. 
[03:43:30]  Come on, bro.  Now that he and Troy have made up, does Troy think he's funny now or what?  Eric wants to know.  I mean, look, you know, everybody has a different sense of humor.  Okay.  And there's stuff that I think is funny and people I think are funnier than other people.  And, you know, I mean, there's the Joe.  Look, when Joe and I got into a fight, Joe has a lot of diehard fans that really love him and blasted me on Twitter.  And that's fine.  That's great.  I think, you know, so I know that there are people out there that appreciate what Joe does. 
[03:44:00]  If Joe wasn't funny, would Bill Burr be chilling with him?  Would ONA have him on the show?  Exactly.  Probably not.  Eric was trying to start some shit.  Yeah, but you didn't have to take the call.  Well, I got to let the listeners have a voice, too.  This is their show as much as it is mine.  Except on Wednesdays.  Vinny.  How come Troy Kwan is always picking on Joe DeRosa?  Is he just mad that Joe DeRosa is more famous than him?  Well, he said he's not picking on him anymore.  He's cool with him now.  But are you mad that Joe DeRosa is more famous than you? 
[03:44:30]  No, because, I mean, we do two different things.  Right.  You know, that's why he goes after Eric, too.  He's mad that Eric makes more money than him.  I mean, Troy Kwan, everyone used to be a DJ, but then we all grew up and got real jobs.  Is that right, Troy?  And now you're just broke and mad at Eric, mad at Joe DeRosa, just because they're more famous than you.  What does this guy do?  They're better at their jobs than you.  What do you do?  What's so great about what you do?  It doesn't matter what I do.  Oh.  Well, okay.  I don't waste my time trashing people that, you know, just because I'm jealous of them.  Well, first of all, Joe went after me, so then I went after him. 
[03:45:00]  And I told you I had a hard time letting it go.  That was the problem.  And we're all good.  Yeah, but he was verbally beating on you, and then you tried to make it physical with him,  just because, you know, Joe DeRosa is not a physical guy, and you would win it like that.  You just tried to trump him like that.  But when it was just words, he was trashing you.  Well, I mean, everybody goes after different people different ways.  Like, if I went after you, and you were here in front of me, you would probably go after  me a different way than somebody else would.  So that's just the way that the argument went.  I mean, is it, do I want to get physical with Joe?  No.  You know, but when the adrenaline starts flowing, and you're standing up, and you're screaming 
[03:45:30]  in each other's face, you know, sometimes shit comes out, you know?  Do I really want to fight Joe?  Fuck no.  Not at all.  That day he was in, you were trashing him, going, let's go out and fuck that motherfucker.  I think that's what I said.  It's a tense time.  It was.  It's a tense time.  And dude, shit just starts falling out of your mouth.  You know, if Joe wanted to walk outside at that point, I would have gone with him.  If, you know, but at the end of the day, I don't want to fight anybody.  Right.  As far as Eric, I mean, it's just, everybody goofs on Eric.  You know, am I jealous of Eric's salary? 
[03:46:00]  Of course.  Of course.  I think what you were getting at was, you don't want to be picked on the way people pick  on Eric, so you will go way above to the next level.  Like, you'll just start coming in, guns blazing, because you don't want people to assume  that they can pick on you.  Yeah, I mean, no offense to Eric.  And look, this is what Eric, the role Eric has wanted to become on the Opie and Anthony  show is he's the punching bag.  He wanted to be the punching bag?  He probably didn't want to be, but that's what he's become.  Eric, you didn't want to be the punching bag.  Not what I set out to do. 
[03:46:30]  No, you weren't sitting there at home going, you know what, this show is great, but if  I were there, they could shit on me a lot.  I could be fucked with on a daily basis.  Yeah.  Like, for instance, I could meet a beautiful woman and get married to her, and they could  call me on my honeymoon and make whale sounds.  That wasn't the dream, Eric?  No, that was not in the divine plan.  In Jamaican gym, called them too.  In Jamaican gym, of course.  But I mean, you understand, like, I mean, he could have easily defended himself, and he  could still defend himself in those, he could, when they crack jokes at him, he could easily 
[03:47:00]  fire something back, but he doesn't.  He just sits there and takes it.  Who were you talking about, Eric, when you said some people on the staff were gay today?  Because you said, uh, you said that the song about you sucking cocks was wrong, but there  were people on the staff that were a bit gay.  Yeah, we all have got a little of it.  All right, so you think it's that inner desire that everybody on the staff has, a little bit  of cock desire?  Yeah.  Okay, I understand.  I guess it is in all of us, isn't it, Roland?  No, but he said no.  He said no.  I'm a specific person, though.  Well, no. 
[03:47:30]  Troy, a little desire for the cock?  I have no desire for the cock.  None.  None.  Hmm, let's ask Sal.  What do you think he is?  Because he's back there.  Oh, I see.  Well, he's answering calls right now.  He's very busy.  He's not.  Where is he?  I don't know where he is.  No, he's probably sitting cock somewhere.  Dr. X.  Not that there's anything.  I mean, if that's what he wants to do, he just shouldn't do it at work, is my point.  Yeah.  Dr. X.  This is Cock Talk with Sam Roberts.  I'd like to know, Roland and Troy, two of my favorite motherfuckers, what would happen if  these two motherfuckers got drunk and turned on each other? 
[03:48:00]  That would be a fucking smackdown.  I'm out.  It would be bad.  You guys have never gotten into a fight.  No.  No.  You haven't?  No.  Have you ever gotten tense with each other?  Yeah.  You have?  Mm-hmm.  Over what?  The first time, when I first started working with Roland, when he came back to the show,  I goofed around and said something to one of the bosses, and then he just fucking went  after the, told the boss, like, all this horrible shit about me.  Before you were friends?  We were just kind of acquaintances at that point.  And what did you tell the boss? 
[03:48:30]  I don't understand.  Well, Roland had something.  He ditched a meeting to go do something with talent.  And this was like, what, like a year and a half ago, two years ago?  Yeah, right when he just started again.  Okay.  And I goofed around.  I said something about it.  I was like, oh, yeah, Roland's busy with, at the, he went to a movie or something instead  of the, instead of the meeting.  Right.  I was like, he said, he thinks that's more important than the meeting or something.  So you were goofing on him to the bosses?  Yes.  Okay.  Just as a goof.  Like, where's Roland?  Oh, he, you know, blah, blah, blah.  He had a, he had a movie to go to instead of the meeting. 
[03:49:00]  But meanwhile, like, he had gotten clearance from everybody involved that he was going to  go do this.  So you figured it's a goof.  It's just a goof.  And then what happened with Roland?  And then he went to one of the big bosses and said that I said all this shit about him.  And then like, was it made up?  It was goofy.  Yeah.  It was completely made up.  He fabricated.  Yeah.  It's like, but once it's said, you can't go back on something like that.  You know what I mean?  Do you even remember?  No.  You don't remember the chaos that you cause.  I go after jugulars.  But do you, do you think if you found out that Troy, and this was when you first started  hanging out with him, does that sound right? 
[03:49:30]  Does that sound like something you would do?  I go after jugulars.  Yeah.  And like, if you found out that Troy had kind of goofed on you for going to a movie instead of  going to a meeting, you would probably go to the upper, the upperest management you could  find and say, just make up shit about Troy.  Yeah.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Where's Troy?  And then, and then pretend that he's made, that he's done terrible things.  Yes.  You would do that.  Why not?  And Roland likes to go up to, you know, say something to the boss and he'll say something  and it'll, you'll get enough out of it to know that something, he's talking about something 
[03:50:00]  bad and then he'll just giggle and walk away.  Right.  And, and, and he mumbles.  He mumbles and he just leaves people thinking like, what the fuck did he just say to me?  Did he just say that Troy said I was stupid?  Yeah.  And then Roland goes, yeah, well, you know, Troy is stupid, he says you, but, and then  he walks away and you go, did Troy say I was, did Troy say I was stupid?  But Roland, you know, Roland did that and it's like, cool man, that's how you play.  I know you don't like to be goofed around like that.  And I, I stopped goofing around. 
[03:50:30]  Lesson learned.  Yeah.  And then I threw napkins at Troy and he destroyed my office.  Oh, that's true.  And then that was the, that was the other bit of tension from the other side.  And I remember that because I was there that day that, uh, Troy, he goes, Roland is, is  threatening to throw napkins at him.  A big stack of napkins.  And Troy, Troy is sitting at a desk with a fan on him and Roland takes a giant thing of napkins  and says, he's going to throw them at him.  So if he threw them up, they wouldn't hit the fan and obviously all hit Troy in the face. 
[03:51:00]  This is all going on at work hours.  And so Troy goes, I don't fuck with you, dude.  Don't fuck with me or I'll fuck with you.  And Roland is just like, ah, whatever.  And so he goes back into the office and then he puts on a pair of bunny ears for whatever  reason.  Roland puts on a pair of bunny ears and he hops outside to Troy's desk and he takes maybe a  hundred napkins.  Could it have been that many?  Possibly even more.  Could have been 150 napkins.  And he just hops over and he goes, Troy. 
[03:51:30]  And Troy looks up and he just unleashes 150 napkins.  They go, they hit you right in the face and they went into the fan.  So they just blew over your entire area.  Right.  And so Troy goes, okay.  And without hesitating, he didn't try to move the napkins.  Look at Nicole out there.  She's making gestures.  She wants attention.  She can come in.  He didn't try to move the napkins.  He stood up.  He let the napkins fall off of him.  He walked into Roland's office and I've never seen another man trash another man's office that 
[03:52:00]  badly.  I took everything that was on his desk and I just scooped everything onto the floor.  I opened up his drawers.  I pulled everything out of the drawers.  I threw them in the trash can.  And I said, next time you fuck with my shit, I'm taking everything out of these drawers  and I'm putting them in the paper shredder.  And you would have.  Absolutely.  And after that, he bonded.  I figured you did this.  Didn't you do this already before?  Yeah.  No, we were just recapping.  Yeah.  We were talking about Nicole from the morning mashup.  We were talking about, because a caller called up.  We were talking about, you know, Danny got fired. 
[03:52:30]  Yes, I'm aware.  We were talking about all, we finally told a story on the air today.  Oh, well that took some time.  Were you nervous?  Did you hear about this porn star, by the way?  You guys hosted the One Direction.  Yeah, I told him it was probably not the best idea.  Uh-huh.  Seeing as there was going to be a bunch of little girls.  Right.  And their parents.  Right.  And they probably shouldn't have titties, you know, hanging out.  Well, I don't know if the porn star was going to perform at One Direction.  Yeah, but you didn't think she was going to come up in proper attire, did you?  Well, I don't know.  I didn't invite her, did I?  No, you didn't.  I'm still sitting here.  Yes, you are.  But were you guys worried? 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  That he was going to show up and do some weird shit?  He wouldn't have done anything.  He was trying to be like an Opie and Anthony superhero.  He was trying to make a bit out of it.  I think that what would have happened, and I think the whole plan from the beginning was  to just show up and make people nervous and not actually do anything, and that would be  the whole thing.  I don't believe that for a second.  That was the thing.  Nobody was going to get...  Because it would have been stupid to actually try to sabotage something, and maybe we should  have made this clear, to my knowledge anyway, and I think if you asked Danny, he would 
[03:53:30]  say the same thing, that the point would have been for Danny to be sitting there with somebody  who you're like, that looks like a porn star.  I'm pretty sure that's a porn star, and Danny's got a reputation.  He works for O&A.  What's this guy planning to do here?  And the whole time you're interviewing One Direction, there's management going, what's  going on here?  What's their plan?  And it just makes him nervous the whole time, and that was it.  Yeah.  Did that work out for you, Danny?  Why do you say...  Because I just think he picked the wrong fight.  I mean, he loves a job over this.  It was...  What a waste. 
[03:54:00]  Well, the problem was, from what Anthony said today, from what he's heard from Danny  and the calls that he got, was it seems that he wasn't fired because of the porn star.  He was fired because of his behavior.  Well, no, because, first of all, you sound like some of his mom right now.  His attitude.  What, are you a teacher's aide?  Should we get into some of your behaviors?  No, let's not.  All right, because you're not exactly a role model over here.  No, he had a bad attitude.  But that's what we heard.  He had a bad attitude with the wrong guy.  Oh, yeah.  And it just happened.  Yeah.  Which is unfortunate, but, you know, happy holidays.  The smile, the shit-eating grin on Roland's face. 
[03:54:30]  Well, you know he loves drama.  No, he loves to get people in trouble.  But this is...  And so we get into fights and people who had fights with Danny, and we were just talking  about what would happen if Roland and Troy ever got into a fight, and we were talking  about tensions that they had with each other early on.  Got it.  I mean, if Roland and Troy, like, became intoxicated and actually got mad at each other, it would  be horrible.  I mean, they would tear down structures.  Yeah.  You know?  Like, they would both be bloodied and broken. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, you guys are tough guys.  I don't know who would win in a fight, because, especially if you guys were intoxicated, because  neither of you would know when to quit.  Yeah, I don't think...  You may kill each other.  Yeah.  I don't think it would ever happen.  I don't know.  I don't think it would ever happen.  No, because I'm not a mean drunk.  No.  If I was a mean drunk, then I'd be worried.  Now, is there any...  Do you guys think that you might get a little drunk, a little tipsy, you're going to Vegas  together?  What happens if, by mistake, who knows what happens, you end up back at the Opie and Anthony  show and you're married to each other?  It's legal. 
[03:55:30]  Wait a minute.  Why are you going to Vegas?  We're going to be in Vegas on Thursday.  They're going to Vegas, well, obviously, Nicole, to rage.  That's it.  Is that right, Troy?  Yeah.  Does that represent you properly?  Well, yeah, because I was going out to California for a couple days at the end of the month,  going, going?  I am going.  Back, back?  To Cali, Cali.  So, I was like, I'll be in Vegas on this day.  I was like, well, and then I saw that Diplo was going to be playing in Vegas.  I'm like, well, fuck it.  I'm going to go see Diplo in Vegas.  Let's go.  And you're going to see Diplo, too, Roland? 
[03:56:00]  I'm trying to make it work out where I can stay two nights in Vegas.  Are you a Diplo fan?  I don't give a shit.  He's a Troy Kwan fan.  Just follow me.  I'll direct you to the party.  Just have fun in Vegas.  That's what I'm going to do.  Right, right.  Get fucked up.  We're going to go crazy.  I wish I was going to Vegas with them.  Come to Vegas with us.  I don't have time.  My husband's having surgery on his knee for the third time.  That's right.  Isn't he like, how old is he?  He's not old.  He just turned 36.  And he's had three knee surgeries?  Yeah, I'm married.  He's not an athlete either.  I'm screwed.  I'm going to be wheeling him around in a wheelchair soon.  It's going to be bad news.  You can park in the corner. 
[03:56:30]  By the way, I want you to know something, Nicole.  In that last 45 seconds, there were at least three sexual, raunchy, terrible jokes that  would have upset you that I didn't make.  I'm really happy.  Thank you.  Yeah, you're welcome.  You wanted to, though.  You held yourself back.  Yeah, I badly wanted to.  She looks really nice today, too.  Nicole does?  Yeah.  Thanks.  She looks very festive.  Yeah.  You know, the red sweater and everything.  Yeah.  Trying to get in the holiday season.  I bet you are.  It's a holiday spirit.  Trying to get into.  Scott, I didn't say it. 
[03:57:00]  No, you didn't say it.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, what's up, Sammy?  Hey, I just wanted to say, too, I agree with Troy on the Joe DeRosa thing.  I don't think the Joe DeRosa's that funny.  That's not what Troy...  Troy was saying that he's cool with Joe DeRosa.  If you agreed with Troy on the Joe DeRosa thing, you'd be like, I agree.  I'm cool with him, too.  I'm not trying to restart the Joe DeRosa.  It was just squashed yesterday.  Don't start it up again.  Thanks, Nicole.  I don't want to say that Joe DeRosa's a bad guy or anything like that.  He's not.  He is kind of like, on a baseball team, how you have a utility infielder, he's kind 
[03:57:30]  of like the utility comedian for the Opie and Anthony show.  The phone...  Utility comedian.  The phone...  For the record, because DeRosa's very sensitive about this stuff.  Yeah.  And for the record, the phone screen says, Scott was going to ask me, why do DJs always ask  callers what they do for a living when things get hostile?  And instead, I pick up the phone and he goes, he's not a funny guy.  No, that was my next question.  Okay.  The Scott and Sam show. 
[03:58:00]  Scott and Sam?  It's the Scott and Sam show.  Oh, your name is Scott.  I forgot your name for a second, but go on.  Go on, Scott.  I'm not kidding.  Yeah.  No, I wanted to know why...  It's my co-host.  Whenever there's a hostile situation between a caller and a DJ, why does the DJ always  ask the caller?  The first question seems to be like a stock question.  What do you do for a living?  Because it's probably not nearly as good as what we do.  Because it's like, if you're calling up to goof on somebody that's doing this, it's like,  well, what do you do that's so great that you could call up and say that? 
[03:58:30]  I think that the point is that you guys will call up and say, well, Troy's just a DJ or  like the last caller goes, we all stopped DJing when we were done with high school and Troy's  still stuck doing that.  And it's not a stock response.  The obvious response would be, okay, well, if DJing sucks so much, what is it that you  do for a living?  Yeah, what's the next level?  What did you graduate to that makes you now so great that you can comment on somebody  still DJing?  I get that.  Yeah, F off, all right?  Jesus, you are hostile, Nicole.  You're taking shots at Danny? 
[03:59:00]  You're taking shots at Scott?  I'm just trying.  I'm standing up for my boy, Troy.  Thank you, Nicole.  And his kid is pretty loud.  Listen, I'm standing up for Troy, too, and I heard that Troy had a big hog.  That would be a question he could ask.  Nicole, does Troy have a big hog?  I don't know.  I bet he does.  He rolled in with two bitches at Caroline's, so yes.  Someone has a question for me.  I want to know what the question is.  Oh, I forgot.  It is about you, isn't it?  I have a question for you, Nicole.  Do you know that time is running out?  Yeah, but I really want to know what they want to ask me.  You need a gift.  I need one that's fast, affordable, and it has to be a gift that the woman in your life, 
[03:59:30]  Nicole, will love.  This is perfect for lesbians, too, and Nicole does have tendencies.  Here's some advice for you, Nicole.  Go see Steven Singer.  Steven Singer's fast.

He has a question for Nicole.  Oh, wait.  If the question is, is Nicole juicy, that was answered already.  Yes.  Let's move on.  Yeah, we've got to move on from that because, yes, diamonds give her vaginal secretions. 
[04:01:30]  Go on, John.  Welcome to After Open Anthony Live.  Do you queef?  Well, thank you.  Nicole, you are a hot piece of ass.  Thank you.  True.  Who would like to know, at any time in the future, will you be posing nude for Calendare  magazine, et cetera?  Nicole, this is a great question because you obviously, you want a career in entertainment.  Mm-hmm.  It's starting to pan out a little bit.  I know, you know, you got the morning mashup that you're a host of.  Yeah.  TV things are always on the horizon with you.  You're always hustling.  What if Playboy came and knocked on your door?  Yeah, if Playboy came to me and offered me enough money, I would 100% take off all my clothes 
[04:02:00]  and I wouldn't even think twice.  What's enough money?  $7,000?  That's not nearly enough money.  What about PETA?  I would 100% pose nude for PETA.  Would you be a vegetarian?  No, but I do love animals.  They don't pay you, though.  Eric would pose, but eat the animals.  I don't care, I do it.  I would do it.  Wait, wait, wait.  What would you do?  Eric would pose with them and eat them?  Just pose with two bunnies over his tits and then just start biting the heads off of  them.  I would totally pose for PETA for no money and I would definitely pose for Playboy for the right 
[04:02:30]  amount of money.  How much is the right amount?  Six figures?  It would have to be...  You'd do it for five.  But I would not do it for five.  Why are you selling short, dude?  First of all, Playboy's not going to offer you $100,000.  No, they're not because I'm not a big enough celebrity.  You wouldn't pose...  If Playboy was like, Nicole, we have $15,000 with your name on it.  $15,000?  Hell no!  And you don't even have to show pink.  Well, no.  What about Swank Magazine?  Would you go down a couple?  No, no.  I would not go...  What about...  Not Playboy.  Not...  I mean, Swank is not classy. 
[04:03:00]  Playboy is the only one I would do.  I wouldn't do Hustler or any of this BS.  Well, that's the question.  No, I would not.  What about something like Hustler?  They would offer you six figures.  No.  But the six figures includes, you know, a nice little spread shot.  Penetration and tinkling.  No, there would be no...  Okay, I didn't realize.  There would be no tinkling.  This is not a...  This is not a solo shoot.  No, they show tinkling.  I don't want anybody tinkling near or on me.  No, you.  You tinkling.  I will not be tinkling in a magazine.  I did once.  I bought a Hustler magazine when I was in college because Jenna Jameson was on the cover.  I didn't know that they showed that stuff in Hustler. 
[04:03:30]  And I'm going through and, you know, I knew it was graphic.  And I'm looking.  Oh, there's her vagina.  That's very nice to see.  Very hot pictures.  And then all of a sudden, there's this picture.  And it's Jenna.  And she's all by herself.  But she's straddled over a bedpan, pissing.  What the heck?  Like, that turns you off?  I said, I didn't know this was in this magazine.  I would only show pink for Playboy and it would have to be the right amount of money.  Playboy doesn't do pink.  They don't show pink.  They show...  I mean, you saw Kim Kardashian.  She'd show a slit.  I'd show slit.  That's not pink.  Pink is what's on the inside.  Fine.  All right.  I'm not spreading.  But I would do it all for Playboy for the right amount of money. 
[04:04:00]  Clearly, I'm not in that point in my career yet.  What if Larry Flint was like, I have a million dollars?  Larry Flint.  A million dollars.  He can go F himself.  I would show the inside of my vagina for a million dollars.  You wouldn't show the inside of your vagina for a million dollars.  What if we raised the money?  What if we did?  What if we had a listener fund drive?  Well, we have some millionaires at work here.  That's right.  You, for instance, Eric.  You are one of them.  It was Eric, Russell Simmons, Donald Trump Jr.  Yeah.  And those are the three millionaire O&A fan Trump fund thing. 
[04:04:30]  And they brought together $1.5 million for a nude, spread eagle, naked Nicole calendar.  1.5.  Oh, calendar?  And Eric, and Yrock gets to shoot.  That's fair, Yrock, right?  That's very fair.  Because you donated a lot of that money.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yrock gets to shoot, and he's also the director, so he gets to make his little comments.  We'll donate to Rita's eyes.  If the old hubby was okay with it, I think I would consider it.  Why would he be okay with it? 
[04:05:00]  I think you'd be okay with it.  Dude, $1.5 million is a lot of money.  He'll be the will share.  He can do nothing.  It's money, and you look hot, and you're showing off.  So why?  He'd probably be happy to do the spreading.  Your husband would spread for you.  For $1.5 million, yes.  Not each.  To share, obviously.  Yeah!  Okay.  That's a lot of money, dude.  I've got morals, okay?  As you can all see now.  The people want to know, Nicole.  Jesse's on the phone.  Jesse.  What's up, Jesse?  Oh, hey, Nicole.  I wanted to know, is your husband still staying out all night?  Are you guys getting along?  No.  You know what?  We've been getting a lot better. 
[04:05:30]  You have?  We've been getting a lot better.  But then I partied a little bit too hard the other day, and then I was really, I got into  a fight with him, so it was my fault.  But we've been getting along a lot better.  You do realize that you guys are at the point where you can't handle drugs and alcohol in  your relationship.  Oh, 100%.  You're not going to change that, though?  Not right now.  No.  Yeah.  No.  Let it roll, right?  We're not ready.  Which party did you get to last night?  I didn't go to a party last night.  I didn't go to a party last night.  I didn't go to a party last night.  The party was in her apartment.  No, the other night.  You know?  I mean, the party's where she goes.  I went too hard, and then I just, I started with him, and it was all over.  Yeah.  Maybe, yeah.  You do. 
[04:06:00]  I mean, drugs are becoming a problem in your life.  And, I mean, alcohol.  Drugs.  What am I?  Crazy?  Alcohol.  Yeah.  She just drinks.  Nicole, she just seems like a lot of fun.  Yeah, I just like to party.  Yeah, but not to be married to.  I can't imagine Nicole and Roland and I in Vegas.  Oh, my God.  The damage that would happen.  You know what would happen?  Somebody would end up dead.  You guys, at one point, as much as you guys do, would look at each other and be like,  is this chick fucking crazy?  What the fuck is she doing?  No, you wouldn't.  You'd love every second of it.  I think so.  But, but, but, but throwing Pearl and Katie. 
[04:06:30]  That said, you'd go along for the ride.  Yeah.  But you'd throw Pearl and Katie in this.  Oh, it would be, it'd be insanity.  All right.  Well, Nicole, I only want the best for you and your marriage.  Thank you.  But it's, the drugs are why it's falling apart.  But I do only want the best for you.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  Troy?  Yes.  Nothing to plug, I guess.  Oh, I do.  Tomorrow night, last DJ night of 2012.  I'm at 675 Bar in the Meatpacking District.  Very exciting.  It's going to be a huge party.  All right.  And you can hit me up at Matchup Nicole and don't say mean things. 
[04:07:00]  They're going to.  When you say mean things, it makes me sad.  We'll see you tomorrow for Jim's show, I guess.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
