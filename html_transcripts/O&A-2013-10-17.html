<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, frequently employing highly profane and sexually explicit language.  The show opened with discussions surrounding the government shutdown and the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), featuring strong criticism of President Obama and the Democratic Party, with callers sharing anecdotes about increased healthcare costs and difficulties with the system.  Jim Norton was a guest throughout this section.  The hosts also engaged in a humorous discussion about bad accents in movies, referencing *Turk 182* and Kevin Costner's performance in *Robin Hood*.  Callers from various states across the US contributed their experiences with Obamacare.

The program then transitioned to a caller's anecdote about a doctor's office and cash payments, leading to further discussion of Obamacare, rising healthcare costs, and doctors demanding retainers.  The hosts shared personal experiences with lacking health insurance and debated regional accents, including the absence of thick Boston accents amongst Black individuals.  A poorly received song from a past segment featuring baseball players was heavily criticized.  The conversation shifted back to the government shutdown, described with expletives, and the perceived hypocrisy of politicians.  George Wendt's appearance on the show, described as awkward, was discussed, along with a critique of a State Farm commercial featuring Wendt's accent.  The Redskins name controversy and logo comparisons were debated, along with the Chief Wahoo logo.  Eric's struggle to deposit a large amount of quarters was discussed, followed by vulgar commentary and violent fantasies.  The discussion then veered into fruit, dog breeds, and the cruelty involved in breeding certain small dogs.  The hosts mentioned upcoming guests Mike Buschetti and Artie Lange's suicide attempt, along with a discussion of Eminem's "Rap God."

A subsequent segment began with a nonsensical discussion about music and zombies before pivoting to a study on Oreos' addictive properties. Anthony recounted stealing Oreos from a roommate.  The discussion branched out to crackers and cheeses, followed by a discussion of Anthony's flatulence, Prince Nagel's alleged sexual practices, and Al Sharpton's weight loss.  An encounter with Robert Klein led to a discussion of booking him as a guest, and Anna Faris's plastic surgery was commented upon.  This was followed by private jokes between the hosts, a critique of the Monday Night Football theme song, and a video of a child with cancer scoring a touchdown. A schoolyard beating was briefly mentioned before transitioning to "Jocktober," a segment mocking other radio shows, specifically "Carson and Kennedy," with audio clips and photos from their Facebook page.  A prank call to a haunted house was also featured.

A significant portion focused on prank calls and the "War of the Roses" radio bit.  A poorly executed prank call on a man suspected of infidelity was played, followed by a discussion of parody songs and the largely pre-packaged nature of the "War of the Roses" segment. Mike Bichetti (later corrected to Bocchetti in another summary) was a guest in the studio and participated in discussions and jokes, including commentary on his masturbatory habits and celebrity crushes.

A later segment heavily featured Mike Bocchetti, a guest announcer for Artie Lange's show. The discussion included an underwhelming film trailer, Bocchetti's Twitter picture, and an anecdote about a sneeze video.  Bocchetti shared personal anecdotes and engaged in sexually graphic conversation detailing his masturbation habits and fantasies, including those involving Christina Ricci.  He promoted his web series and upcoming stand-up gigs.  The hosts challenged him to remain still, which he failed comically.  Topics included Bocchetti's past experiences, views on women, a rant about Hollywood's lack of originality, and a promotional read for Russell Peters.  His time in the Marine Corps was also discussed, and a phone call from a fan who attended the Opie and Anthony "Pig Roast" occurred.

The final segment featured Mike Bichetti (again, potentially Bocchetti), focusing on his dancing abilities and preferences for women, using vulgar and sexually explicit language. His attraction to "stacked" women, including a preference for those of Ethiopian descent, was discussed,  along with humorous exchanges about his ideal woman's ability to handle his sweat.  His Twitter handle was promoted before transitioning to the Ron and Fez segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m. and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flesh you didn't.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to sound like.  Like rotten eggs and sew it.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point Simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make the fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double gun, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes.  Good morning, everybody.  I guess the government's working again. 
[00:02:00]  Apparently so.  Ah, good for you.  Back to work, everyone.  Back to work.  The government is there once again to serve you.  The people.  The people.  Thank God.  I want to tip my hat to the courageous people that represent us in Washington.  What a brave move. 
[00:02:30]  What are they saying?  You see their dumb talking head speeches?  No, the blowhires.  The blowhires.  It was very courageous.  We kicked the can down the road.  Courageous.  What's praise boning this horse shit for three or so months?  Well, we get past Christmas.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone could do their Christmas shopping, so.  They're still divided as ever.  Nothing will get done.  And then you get stupid, stupid Obama. 
[00:03:00]  Obama goes, well, now we've got to move ahead, and jumps right into his immigration horse shit.  How about something that fucking benefits the country?  Like jobs or something?  Not dragging in more burdens on this society from over the borders?  Jesus H. Christ.  You went for the main guy right there.  Right there.  Right there.  I'm courageous.  There's a lot of players in this one.  Oh, I know.  But that's what I heard. 
[00:03:30]  Like Obama was like, we've got to move forward.  And he's being a bit smug.  And Carney was like, yes, well, we're moving forward.  The president's very interested in getting this immigration reform done.  So you get right out of this, where it's completely divided the nation, divided Congress and the House,  and jump into something else that no one really fucking wants.  Time to move on.  Move on to something like legitimately getting jobs.  Setting up some infrastructure projects, perhaps, that could get people working really seriously. 
[00:04:00]  What's that?  Working on oil pipelines and infrastructure.  That'll make jobs.  Instead, he wants the ability to drag more fucking burdens over the borders so he has more voters.  That's pretty much it.  Let's not even fucking bullshit.  I don't care what party you're for.  The only reason the Democrats love immigrants coming over and giving amnesty to illegals is the fact that they will vote Democratic. 
[00:04:30]  Democratic, and it's more votes for them.  And that's the only reason they're doing it.  Why else would you want to fucking do it?  There's an unemployment problem in this country, and you want to drag more people into the country?  Well, yeah.  More unskilled fucking people?  Well, yeah.  Who else is going to do the laundry?  Exactly.  There you go.  It's jobs no one wants in the end. 
[00:05:00]  Well, there's plenty of those, too.  Shutdown costs U.S. economy $24 billion.  How did that happen?  Well, if you're not working, you're not spending.  Yeah.  Period, right?  I guess.  Is that where that number comes from?  And who came up with that number?  Yeah, who comes up with that?  I love the...  There's got to be just some nerd in some, like, just sad office somewhere that just, like I said yesterday, crunches the numbers and just kind of throws a number out there.  Well, here it is.  This is what it costs.  The boss comes into some dank office where some guy is in front of an old-fashioned adding machine with a visor on. 
[00:05:30]  I've crunched the numbers, sir.  It's like a Brian Regan bit.  Yeah.  Okay, this is what it costs the economy.  How do you know?  Oh, I crunched the numbers.  I crunched the numbers.  Well, what does that mean?  They've been crunched.  But I hate the round-off.  $24 billion, which means they weren't sure if it was $23 or $25.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's give or take a billion in the end, right? 
[00:06:00]  Give or take 1,000 piles of a million dollars.  Exactly.  That's why that number is nonsense.  They just throw that number out there.  Yeah, yeah.  Should we say $23 or $24?  Let's go with $24 billion.  It cost the economy.  Right.  What does that even mean?  These numbers that they're throwing out as far as money goes with the government these days,  they're inconceivable numbers.  $16, $17 trillion.  Sure.  No one even knows what that means. 
[00:06:30]  You can't wrap your mind around a fucking number like that.  We were so close to some real shit going down.  Some action.  Which could have been maybe very good for the country in the long run.  Not in the short term, certainly.  A little chaos.  But then all those fucking idiots down there in Washington started getting scared how it was going to affect them.  And of course, we all knew this was going to happen.  Yeah.  On the final hour, that they would figure out some kind of deal.  Yes, they do it all the time.  Because they don't want to fuck up their own careers. 
[00:07:00]  They don't want to lose their beach houses.  They're fucking...  Exactly.  I was telling Anthony, that's why there will be no major change in this country anytime soon.  Because there's too much to lose for most people.  Yeah.  Like when you go to another country, you know, they have no problem picking up fucking bread and whatever they can find to throw at people.  Yeah.  Because they have nothing to lose.  Nope.  When the shit goes bad in this country, you start thinking, all right, wait a minute, fuck, this could affect me personally. 
[00:07:30]  Nah, I can't do it.  And then you have to tap out.  Yep.  We're seeing the tap out right now.  We're not brave enough to continue forward with this shit.  Americans have to stay on the fucking hamster wheel.  We can't jump off for shenanigans.  It's too good in this country.  So we got to stay on the wheel.  And our whole lifestyle is that of people that need to keep doing things.  We don't have time to really protest or revolt or anything like that. 
[00:08:00]  It's a weird little system we got.  We came close.  Yeah.  But in the end, no one's brave enough to push it any further than that.  No.  No one.  Not one person in Washington.  Maybe the Cruz dude.  Yeah.  Maybe Mr. Cruz.  Did you also see the little part of the bill that they had that the Republicans wanted to put through that said that the president, vice president, all the members of Congress and their aides and everything had to use Obamacare. 
[00:08:30]  They had to go to the website and use it.  And they were like, oh, no.  We don't want to do that.  How fucked up is that?  If Obamacare is so good, why wouldn't Congress want to use it?  And why would they have to penalize people for not using it?  But they're exempt.  Yeah.  They're exempt.  And they represent us.  So if they're representing us and it's Obamacare so damn great, then why would they set the example?  Exactly.  Why?  What does that mean for us? 
[00:09:00]  I don't even know what it means for us.  I don't understand why people don't see that and think like, ah.  I think people see it, but.  Yeah.  What do we have to do?  Do we have to go to a website?  I don't even know.  I have no idea.  No, I think we're okay.  I just figured I'll just get penalized.  There'll be some weird bill that comes in the mail.  Right, right, right.  That I was penalized for not doing Obamacare properly and I'll just pay it.  Yeah.  Because I can't be bothered.  I don't even know what I'm supposed to do.  And I got employees.  What am I supposed to do?  I don't know either. 
[00:09:30]  Do I fire employees now?  Just fire everybody.  All right.  That's what I would do.  I'm going to do that too.  You really don't know either, right?  I don't know.  Are we good?  If it affects us.  We, yeah, we're like a small business.  You know, we're a, we're a business and we have things and we have insurance.  So I got employees.  I guess we'll have to pay the penalty because I want to keep my health insurance.  I like it.  I don't want to go to the 80% coverage for twice the fucking premium.  Do you have to pay a penalty if you already have insurance and you just don't want to drop 
[00:10:00]  your insurance?  That's what we're trying to figure out.  If your insurance does not fit the criteria of Obamacare, which means things like maternity  leave, then you have to get new insurance.  I think like anything else in this country, they make it kind of complicated because they  want to catch a few people.  Of course they do.  And, you know, penalize you.  It's all about penalizing the people because it's, I use this word a lot, but it's true.  It's another revenue strain.  It's a revenue strain. 
[00:10:30]  So if they make it really easy, they're not going to catch some people fucking it up because  it's too easy.  Right.  They want to make it a little complicated and they want you to fall through the cracks.  The cracks.  Or the craps.  The cracks.  And then they penalize you.  Yep.  To get some of that money coming in.  Get some revenue, as they call it.  The revenue.  Yeah.  Revenue, tax, whatever.  So, yeah, so, um, I know there's 10 things that everybody's insurance policy needs to  have, uh, or else you need to get new insurance that has all those things. 
[00:11:00]  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are the 10 things?  Does anyone out there know?  I know the maternity leave part.  I think the, uh, I, I don't know what, what the other ones are.  There's going to be someone, there's going to be a couple that are a little weird and obscure.  Yeah.  And people aren't going to get it because they don't, they're going to feel like they  don't need it or whatever.  And then if you're some guy in his fucking sixties, what do you care if you have maternity  leave on your fucking insurance policy? 
[00:11:30]  It really is just ridiculous.  I mean, it's standard.  I just don't think it was ready to be rolled out.  I don't think so either.  And I really don't like the fact that the government has the potential of telling you what you have  to buy like that.  I mean, you have to, there's no ifs, ands or buts about it.  Why would they call it a tax?  Why would the Supreme Court do that?  Just so they could get, push it through.  It's amazing.  Why did they want to push it through?  I don't know.  It's weird how that works, isn't it?  Because of the money.  Yeah.  It's like, well, it's tax.  It boils down to money. 
[00:12:00]  That's why they wanted to push it through.  They don't give a fuck about the individual.  But do they care?  Does the Supreme Court care about the money?  I mean, they might.  I mean, I just don't know.  I don't know enough about that.  Is it for the greater good of the country?  Probably.  I don't know.  And it was a...  Probably.  And the deciding vote was like more of a conservative judge.  Yeah, that's...  John, what's your name?  John...  Fucking asshole is who I call him.  I call him asshole.  That's not his name.  Oh, here's everything you need?  Yeah.  Ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care. 
[00:12:30]  This is...  That's ridiculous.  This is everything your health insurance needs.  You have to have this.  Or you're going to get penalized.  Right.  Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment, prescription drugs,  rehabilitative and habitable services and devices, laboratory services.  Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management, pediatric services, including 
[00:13:00]  oral and vision care.  Pediatric services.  So that means you've got to get a dentist for your kid and an eye doctor.  Why do you...  If you have no children, why do you need like maternity or...  Exactly.  And you're saying every single...  Every single criteria there needs to be met.  The maternity one especially is there to catch fucking people.  Uh-huh.  So they can penalize you.  Period.  Yeah.  Period.  And this is the part of the socialized medicine that people talk about, because now everyone's 
[00:13:30]  going to have to pay that.  So now what you're going to get, especially from maternity care and pediatric care, you  get what I call the fucking leeches in this country.  The ones that will get government subsidies for their health care.  They won't pay for it.  The government will pay for it because they're not making any money because they're on fucking  welfare already.  And we, who now have to get new insurance policies and pay higher premiums, are paying  the premiums for the maternity care, even though we're not using it, and for the pediatric 
[00:14:00]  care, even though we don't have kids.  And that money will be all shifted around and put in the till, and it'll be spit out to  the fucking leeches in this country that, again, we have the burden of caring for their fucking  offspring pieces of shit kids.  That's what it is.  That's why the criteria, not for us, they know that.  It's so the money can go in and come out the bottom and fucking take care of more illegitimate 
[00:14:30]  fuckwad kids.  How do you know if you're, like, I have after insurance from being an after, like, uh, it's  whatever their company, you know how they always have different companies, you never  know who it is, you look at the card, like, I don't know my insurance.  I don't know, it's, yeah.  How do you have that?  I don't care if I have that.  Exactly.  And I won't pay a penalty.  Yes, I will.  Most people just won't be bothered and they'll just pay some weird little penalty.  How much is the penalty?  I don't know.  I don't know.  The first year, it's something, and then it goes up as years go on if you don't adhere 
[00:15:00]  to the fucking thing.  And by the way, the penalty is given to you through the Internal Revenue Service.  Of course.  So they got their fucking mitts in it, too.  And because they're the ones, who better, to track everyone's finances and how much money  you have and just extract it right from your fucking tax bill.  It is a tax.  It's a tax.  Of course it is. 
[00:15:30]  The IRS is fucking, and it was never presented that way.  More lies.  I'm sick of it.  This government we have just stinks.  They always stink, and they will always stink.  I know.  It doesn't matter who's running it.  They're just fucking, they're just, they're just scum.  I was going to say they're rapists, but that's not a smart enough term.  They're just shit.  But in a way, it does also matter who's running things, because it does kind of, it doesn't  make these sharp turns. 
[00:16:00]  It's like an oil tanker.  It fucking makes these little moves one way or the other that, like, either, you know,  benefit or to the people's detriment one way or another.  But it does have an effect.  But what happens is, you know, one side builds a really nice house for four years, eight years,  whatever it would be.  And then the new guy comes in, who's from the other side, and goes, nope, and just fucking  tears down the really nice house and starts all over.  So nothing gets done.  Right.  The oil tanker is a smart analogy. 
[00:16:30]  That's a good way to look at it.  It doesn't make sharp rice.  No, it just goes.  But eventually, you know, it does something.  Whatever.  But I find I don't benefit from really any of them.  My taxes kind of stay the same.  It goes up here and there.  It's just, oh, I can't do this that much.  But that one, I don't see enough of a difference between, even an arch-conservative like Bush  and an arch-liberal like Obama, I don't see as much of a difference in my life.  They're all just shit.  Low-lifes benefit.  Low-lifes benefit or get hurt by the government. 
[00:17:00]  The middle class gets just fucked constantly.  Period.  Well, the middle class really gets squeezed.  They're like the ATM.  It never gets better for them enough to make a real difference.  The wealthy get hurt because they get the shit taxed out of them.  We just get annoyed, though.  Yeah, yeah.  But you still have some money.  And in the end, I still got my fucking lifestyle.  Yeah.  It's the middle class.  Middle class.  No matter who the fuck is in office, they're the ones that don't see a significant change 
[00:17:30]  that'll help their lives.  It's just the low-lifes that really see the shift.  Like, try walking up to a senator and going, like, you're asking him how much money he's  got in his pocket.  Like, say he's got, like, you know, $800 in his pocket.  Say, well, give me five or six.  Well, you don't really, do you really need that much?  It's like, that's the equivalent of when they just keep taking more of your money.  I haven't seen one politician on TV I like in a long fucking time.  No.  I don't even like Christie.  He's a fucking, he's posturing and making his fucking moves, shucking and jiving for 
[00:18:00]  fucking office in 2016.  Ah, Christie.  I don't like any of them.  They're all jockeying around for the midterm elections.  It's just.  For their own interests.  For their own.  It's always for their own interests.  It's always for their own interests.  There's got to be term limits on these motherfuckers.  That would be a start, but how are we going to get that in place?  I know.  Hey, the people want that.  Yeah.  No.  The people want that. 
[00:18:30]  But we vote on it, so fuck you.  Right.  It's like, it doesn't make any sense.  That would be a great start.  It would be, because they're in here now for careers.  Right.  That's their career as a politician.  Instead of serving your country, getting something done, legitimately representing your people,  and then you go back into, you know, the personal sector, the private sector.  I agree with term limits in a way, because I hate these guys.  But you know what term limits are?  Like, when you think about it, it's just, it allows us to be lazy.  Like, as a public, because, and I don't vote, and I admit that I don't, but we don't, we're not, 
[00:19:00]  you can get them out any time we want to.  We can get any of these people out any time we want.  Well, the voters got to, oh, but it's organized better than, oh, the voters.  Because a lot of these people are too stupid.  A lot of these voters just go, oh, here's my guy.  They don't even know what that guy's been up to for the last four, eight, 12, 16 years.  Oh, this is the guy I always vote for.  Got to vote for him again.  Well, what is he going to do for you?  I don't know.  I just recognize his name on the ballot.  Would you take Bloomberg again if you could right now? 
[00:19:30]  I love Bloomberg now.  I'm up in the air on him.  Considering the fucking, uh.  Over de Blasio?  Considering who might come in?  Oh my God, yeah.  De Blasio's all upset at the new spots that are running against him about, they show the  old New York, old 70s New York with the burnt out buildings and fucking abandoned cars.  He's like, that's ridiculous and New Yorkers will reject this ad.  They'll be disgusted.  Why?  Like, everything he's talking about is, is, uh, not good for the city and not good for, 
[00:20:00]  uh, uh, for, for fighting crime.  Not good for, uh, anti-terrorism.  You see this fucking Muslim thing with him?  He's, he's, uh, preaching to the Muslims.  Don't worry.  We're going to have an oversight committee on the fucking NYPD and they will no longer  be able to just spy on you.  My Muslim friends.  Ugh.  Believe me, they're keeping them in fucking check.  No one's rights are being fucking slammed down their throats.  And, and they're, they're... 
[00:20:30]  And who isn't getting, who isn't getting spied on at this point?  Exactly, I was just going to say that.  Everyone's being fucking spied on.  It's crazy.  We all got a fucking footprint out there.  Look, the Muslims need to be fucking looked at.  Some of these mosques need to have somebody go in there and, and poke around and listen  to what the fucking scuttlebutt is.  Listen to what the scuttlebutt is.  The scuttlebutt.  An undercover rogue salesman. 
[00:21:00]  He needs to go in and out a few times.  Exactly.  Just a bad NYPD undercover guy walks in, does not look Muslim at all, does not look Muslim,  poking around.  Hey, what's going on in here?  Hey.  Yeah, Allah.  Bloomberg.  What's the scope?  We bombing anyone?  Bloomberg, though, you know, doe.  I've been a New Yorker now for, I don't know, 12 years.  He does some annoying things here and there.  But in general, man, the city's running pretty well.  Yeah.  It runs pretty well.  I can't believe I'm saying that.  There's things I absolutely hate about New York, but in general, you know, I think we'd 
[00:21:30]  be safe to just, you know, have him again, which obviously isn't going to happen.  It's his personal policy.  Well, he doesn't like Banksy is the new one.  Yeah, yeah.  Then he does the annoying shit.  He's trying to say he's an art lover.  Yeah.  I'm an art lover.  I hate when people do this.  I'm an art lover.  I know art, but.  But?  The but always proves you're not an art lover.  That's not art.  You're not a true art lover.  Yeah, yeah.  And as far as art goes, I think you can find a majority of people that can look at something 
[00:22:00]  and go, all right, that's, that's just not art.  Right.  Banksy does not fall in that category, period.  Banksy is art, right?  Banksy's very clever.  He just doesn't think that the mayor doesn't think that spray painting someone's public property  is considered art.  I think Banksy's doing a little more than just spray painting someone's property, Mr. Bloomberg.  But he's got the NYPD on it.  They want to catch Banksy.  Oh, man.  This is like a superhero movie all of a sudden. 
[00:22:30]  Banksy's on the run.  We've got to get Banksy.  Banksy.  They're obsessed.  God, nothing about Banksy.  Because for some reason, Bloomberg thinks Banksy's making him and the city look bad.  Yeah.  Has he ever been caught?  Is that his mystique?  He's like Turk 182.  I love Turk 182.  Turk 182 on the Queensborough Bridge.  Yep.  I like that dumb movie.  I don't know if it holds up.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't?  You tried it?  Yeah, I tried it recently.  It does not hold up.  And fucking, oh, God, what's his name? 
[00:23:00]  Who was in Vegas and fucking Dan Tano.  What's his name?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Someone will get it right here, right here.  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  Anyway, Spencer, he was in Spencer.  For Hire.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  His accent is so fucking bad in that movie.  Really?  Robert Urich, thank you.  He's trying to do this Brooklyn accent, I guess.  It's so, so fucking bad.  Is it terrible?  Oh, it's so bad. 
[00:23:30]  Find a clip.  Maybe you can find a clip of Robert Urich from Turk 182.  And we can get some bad.  I love the bad accents.  Especially when you're from that area, so you really know.  It's so bad.  Like the New York accent gets fucking chopped apart in movies all the time.  Yeah.  And what was that famous movie where someone started with an accent and then said, fuck it,  I can't do it.  Oh, there's been a few of those.  Robin Hood.  Robin Hood.  Was it Robin Hood?  Kevin Costner.  He just said, fuck it, and just started talking normal, right?  Yeah, his British accent just fell apart. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, okay.  Really?  Yeah, that's the famous one.  Okay.  I think there's a few others in there, too.  Michelle Pfeiffer kind of fell apart in Dangerous Minds.  If you watch her southern accent in that, it's kind of like that.  And I guess a little bit later, they took it and it was like that.  Oh, my God.  It was awful.  They probably had to do some redos, and she just forgot how to talk that way or something.  Or they just don't match up from different takes.  Right.  Oh, it's weird.  And, yeah, Princess Leia, she has started out with some kind of English accent.  Oh, right. 
[00:24:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  She's like, I thought I smelt your foul stench when you came aboard.  And then later on, it's gone.  Yeah.  Just completely gone.  Steve Martin did a good accent in My Blue Heaven.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it was terrible, right?  No, it was good.  Oh, no.  Well, Jimmy doesn't.  Oh, boy, Jimmy doesn't.  It was good.  Yeah, you might know the same people.  Steve Martin had to say, like, what?  Exactly.  No, but I've been rather harsh on Steve Martin at times, but, I mean, he's good in that.  Yeah.  Colin's one of Colin's favorite films.  He doesn't look good. 
[00:25:00]  You've got to give him credit.  That one's due.  It's one of those movies that's so bad, it's worth watching, right?  Yeah, I mean, I haven't seen it a lot of times.  I saw that Man of Steel movie last night.  How was that?  It was pretty good.  Is that out?  What?  It's out?  Huh?  That fucking response, it was like when David Brent has the fat girl show up, and she  goes, David?  And he's like, he turns away and he goes, yeah. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  And you know he doesn't want to talk.  Oh, for fuck's sake.  I thought it was pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we go back to the phones, because we've got a guy that's very excited about Obamacare.  Oh, is he?  It's a hot topic today.  Ben in Queens, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  First of all, I think how great it is to call your show and actually hear a girl's voice.  It's so unexpected.  Oh, the intern on the phones, huh?  Yeah.  Or is it fucking Sal?  The girl.  He just meant like a fruit. 
[00:26:00]  Nikki's a delightful young lady.  Sure.  She's got a cute little bow in her hair today.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  I told her to wear it.  It's yours.  I said to all the interns, I want Bose from now on.  And she's the only one to listen.  Benny, what do you got?  Anyways, I just moved back to the U.S. and I had a job opening for like an hourly wage.  And I'm making like an hourly salary.  I don't get insurance at my work.  The $300, $400, or excuse me, the $400, $500 to buy insurance on my own is just a bit too much for me. 
[00:26:30]  And I'm like super excited for Obamacare if I'm actually going to get health insurance.  Yeah, okay.  How much do you make an hour?  I make $12 an hour.  Yeah, Obamacare's perfect for you.  There you go.  But the middle class is paying the bill.  Congrats.  Paying a lot of the bill.  Because all their fucking insurance is going up to a point they can't really handle it.  There are a few people that are making out on this Obamacare.  Of course we said that.  Absolutely.  I don't see where the middle class benefits in general.  Yeah.  I asked around my own family and their fucking bills are going up a bit. 
[00:27:00]  And they just can't, they can't, they can't pay it anymore.  Yeah.  When you got both parents working, there's a problem in this country.  Mm-hmm.  And we're old enough, you know, we're old enough where we remember where our mommy stayed home.  Oh.  You had the career moms, which is fine.  I'm not saying, you know, mothers shouldn't work and have a career.  But I'm talking about, you know, the majority of moms that have to work just so they can pay all the fucking bills in the household. 
[00:27:30]  For the most part.  They don't want to work.  When you were a kid, for the most part, running around your neighborhood with your friends and stuff, you'd go to anyone's house and the mom would just be home.  Oh, yeah.  The mom was fucking home.  Remember the latchkey kids just started and how weird that seemed?  Yeah, yeah.  And there was always maybe, maybe one when we were growing up.  Oh, Johnny.  Johnny goes home to nobody at the house.  I remember maybe one or two kids that didn't have a mom home when they came home from school. 
[00:28:00]  Now, you ask these kids.  They're all going home to empty houses.  That's a problem.  That is a fucking problem.  What?  Are you guys generally in for the idea of giving people health insurance who can't afford it?  Or, I don't, Jimmy.  Well, I don't mind.  I don't mind it.  I don't mind it.  I just think it was too early to roll out.  I think this thing needed to be looked at a little more because, you know, people are being hurt by this as well.  Because their shit is going up. 
[00:28:30]  And they can't afford their shit going up anymore.  Look, I make enough money.  I don't give a fuck in the end.  You know, it's not going to hurt me.  Like I said, it's bothersome, certainly.  But it's not going to change my lifestyle.  I fight for the rest of my family members that are all middle class.  And I see they can't afford their fucking bills.  Know why I know that?  Because they come to me for fucking money.  Because they're desperate.  I understand it, too.  I'm not even mad by it.  They're desperate.  And they're working hard. 
[00:29:00]  They got jobs.  They got decent jobs.  And they still can't fucking make ends meet.  I've gotten the same calls from my family.  You know how hard it is to say that if you can't afford bread, then you should enjoy cake.  That's him on the phone.  That's very good.  But for a guy like you, Benny, you know, great.  Good for you.  Because, yeah, it will help you.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, listen, I understand.  I just got something that benefits me.  It doesn't mean it's right for the whole country.  But I'm just saying there are people out there, like me, who are regular, go out and work, and still, you know, are unbelievably excited for this. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, and I hate to see people not get health coverage who are hardworking and who just don't have the money.  Like, that always bothers me.  It's like, I want to see people taken care of and have their health cared for.  Yeah, but it just needed to be, like, looked at a little more.  I mean, people will absolutely lose their jobs over Obamacare.  That's a fact.  Yeah.  What the hell do I know?  Bill me now. 
[00:30:00]  Ask me later.  That's what I say.  All right, Benny.  Love you, Mr. Brother.  That's what you should say.  I sure do.  Down at the job site.  Say it five, six times a day.  Yeah.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank K.  Hey, guys.  I work for a huge company in Westchester.  Tens of thousands employees.  I've been tasked over the last couple of years to be the Obamacare expert.  Maybe I can answer some of your questions.  But one thing, the reason for those ten items you guys were talking about is basically so when you go onto the website, the marketplace, 
[00:30:30]  and try to choose your insurance, that every insurance company can offer the same basic insurance with the same ten base items.  And it's just so when you go onto the website, you don't have a thousand different things to choose from.  Every insurance company has to offer you the same thing.  And that's the reason why they give you those ten items.  But let me ask you.  Why can't you pick and choose what you want?  Like, literally, this is what bothers me.  How can the government tell me?  Maybe in America you can do that, but not in this country. 
[00:31:00]  What?  Exactly.  How can the government tell me I have to choose a certain insurance if one serves my needs better?  They can't tell you that, but they could tax you.  That's what the whole fucking gist was.  The government can't force you to buy something.  That's what they say.  But they're technically forcing you to buy something.  But it's a tax, see?  What kind of fucking semantics bullshit is that?  I don't have a problem with the whole concept of Obamacare.  The problem I have is everything is based on this federal poverty level. 
[00:31:30]  There's just one number that's supposed to work for everybody in the entire country.  Yeah.  And once you start making over $70,000, you're not getting any subsidies.  Nope.  But the difference between making $70,000 in New York and making $70,000 in western Florida  is a huge difference.  It's an amazing bill down there.  It's a major difference.  When I leave New York and do my shit, I can't believe how much things cost.  It amazes me.  You know what the most amazing thing is when you leave New York?  When you stay in a hotel anywhere else in the country. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  Anywhere else in the country.  You get a hotel room and you're like, this is half of what it is in New York City.  And you go out to a halfway decent dinner and you're expecting, you know, $300, $400 bill.  And it's like, that'll be $120.  And I'm like, but we have two bottles of wine.  How is this possible?  It's amazing how expensive shit is here.  You're right, Frankie.  And they don't do it regionally and think like, you know, yeah, somebody making $70,000 in New York City is not very well off. 
[00:32:30]  You make $70,000 in fucking West Virginia, you're the king of West Virginia.  There's a lot of households that, you know, combined make 100 Gs in the New York area.  And I'm telling you, that's not even close to enough, believe it or not.  But anywhere else, that would be a nice living.  Anything else, Frank?  Well, Frank was better.  All right, let me say hi to Rick in Texas.  Rick.  Yeah, you know, before Obama got elected, I had free insurance for my company. 
[00:33:00]  They paid for everything.  Not a dime out of my fucking pocket.  Once Obama got elected and he passed Obamacare, boom, my insurance was dropped.  And it went from being free to a car payment.  Then, right now, it's a mortgage payment.  Now it's going to go to a mortgage and a fucking car payment.  And, you know, it's a bunch of bullshit, man.  This is exactly what I'm talking about.  This is the, you know, the section of America that is getting fucking hurt.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks, guys. 
[00:33:30]  Later.  Working people.  Yeah.  Yep.  Just squeaking by your regular Joe, you know.  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah, what am I going to do?  Not put a little sippy juice in my lunch pail?  I like to have a Snapple.  Just cracking a Snapple on the job site.  Yeah, don't drink on the job.  You do that.  I have a Snapple.  I stay sharp.  PB&J.  Don in Alaska.  Don.  Hey, you know, because I work for myself and everything, so I've got my own insurance. 
[00:34:00]  What my policy was before was $188.  I didn't have maternity leave, no child care bullshit and everything else.  Now that with Obamacare, with these 10 points, my insurance has gone up $200 a month.  And that's if I can sit there and get it, because I've got to go and log on to the website  and I like how to bullshit, pay for a bunch of other shit based on a $5,000, $10,000 deductible.  Right now, I've got a $3,000 deductible.  Once I meet that, my insurance covers me 100% for anything up to $1,000,000. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, the Obamacare completely just ignored the middle class.  And you will get these defenders that will say that this guy doesn't exist.  Oh, that's not happening.  Oh, no, it's not.  It's like you're hearing it from a lot of people.  Look, I'm just, I mean, every single phone is lit and they all are saying that their shit  is going up.  Yeah.  And they're not happy about it.  So you used to pay $188 a month and now you're estimating it's going to be about $388 a month? 
[00:35:00]  It's $390 a month.  And here's one of the things.  Now, when you go down and buy a car, you buy a house, they tell you how much it is right  up front.  Yeah.  If you go to the website, you don't know jack shit about how much it's going to cost you  until after you give them all your information, all your stuff, the whole nine yards.  Here's another thing.  If I decide to keep my $188 a month policy, which is fucking fabulous, but if I decide  to keep that, they can fine me or, excuse me, tax me between one and three percent of 
[00:35:30]  my annual income.  Jesus.  What the fuck is that?  Yeah.  It's a tax, sir.  That's okay.  It's just a tax.  Another tax.  Unbelievable.  I guess we could handle another tax in this country, right?  That is, yeah, the government stepping into your life there.  Welcome.  Open your door and welcome them in to fuck you in the ass.  And then you got, I mean, look, I said people will lose their jobs.  Here's an example of that.  Birdman on Long Island.  Go ahead. 
[00:36:00]  What's happening, fellas?  Long time on the call.  Hey, listen, I own a company.  I got about 15, 20.  What kind of company?  I mean, it could be even vague, but what kind of...  I own a fence company.  Fence.  Fence work, right?  Okay, yeah.  I got guys, legit guys, you know.  I'm going to have to go with all illegal aliens, you know, immigrant.  So I don't have to pay no...  My insurance is $25,000 a month for health insurance.  For your employees?  For my employees.  And that's going to...  I'm done.  I can't do it all.  And what?  That $25,000 is going to go up with... 
[00:36:30]  It's going to go to $50,000.  It's going to go to $50,000, you think?  Yeah, oh yeah.  It's going to go double.  My account already said it's going to go double.  How can I afford that?  It's ridiculous.  So what you'd have to do is now lay people off.  Yeah.  And then you go...  And then drive by Home Depot every morning.  That's what I'm going to do.  I just go to...  I know where I've got to go.  So small businesses kind of get fucked really well.  Five big time.  Yes.  It's crazy, man.  Absolutely.  5%, 10% is one thing.  And that's another thing is that the website, you do, you have to put in all of your information 
[00:37:00]  before you even get any information back as to what insurance policy you want to do.  So, I mean, you're putting in every fucking bit of your personal information into this  government website.  It just seems fucking shady.  These things always end up being something else, too.  Guaranteed, sometime in the future, they're going to find out that this database of everybody's  information was used for something else, was fucking, you know, the NSA or fucking FBI 
[00:37:30]  poked into it to check something out.  They're going to know when you take a piss and shit, you know what I mean?  Right.  It always ends up this way.  Or it gets hacked and somebody gets the information, you know.  Hey, Birdman.  Vote for the Moulyonigan.  Birdman, if I ever need a fence, I'm coming your way.  I love you.  I love this guy.  Thanks, buddy.  I live in the sky, but, you know.  And I'm in your neighborhood, Ant.  Good fences make good neighbors, my friend.  You got it, buddy.  All right, Birdman.  I like a nice fence in my apartment.  What? 
[00:38:00]  I fence off the living room.  You let the kids go in there in their wild jungle.  Mike of Long Island.  Mike.  Hey, what's going on?  Welcome aboard, Mike.  Hi, Mike.  We're talking to the people right now.  Give you a quick story.  Oh.  My daughter, two college degrees, works for a plastic surgeon, old-timer in Manhattan.  Speaks his mind.  Walked into a conference room, told everybody in the office, we're going to have to lay  all you guys off.  You're all going to be part-time now.  You're going to have to get another job, and you can thank President Obama.  Damn.  These are real stories that the news, you know, isn't really tackling. 
[00:38:30]  You just put the phones on, and these are the real stories coming in.  Absolutely.  So it's insane, man.  Anthony and Oprah, they're right on, man.  100%.  Yes, they are.  They're going to have to do something.  All right, brother.  Thanks.  All right, brother.  Take care.  Well, it's that old gag, the attempt to hire, which I was part of for a while.  I've worked for Xerox in Rochester.  Ooh.  And they dangled that carrot in front of you.  I needed a job.  I wanted to go into radio, and I was part-timing, and I needed to pay bills, so I got a job at 
[00:39:00]  Xerox.  And it was an attempt to hire.  And they dangled the carrot in front of you, like, it's an attempt to hire.  Hey, they might hire you.  They might hire you full-time if you're good.  I forgot the percentage of people that actually got hired in the end, because they had to  hire some people, or that attempt to hire would be a complete bullshit.  The percentage was so low.  Like, I'm saying maybe 1%.  Yeah, yeah.  And the rest, they had no intention of ever hiring, because they didn't want to pay health  insurance and everything else. 
[00:39:30]  The benefits, yo.  So that's how they got around it.  But you're going to see more people doing that type of shit.  You're allowed to hire just part-time guys, right?  So you can only not pay the health?  Yep.  They are.  So that's what they do.  They're going to cut people's shifts in half.  Just hire more people part-time.  And that eventually will hurt the economy and hurt the country, obviously.  It all will trickle down eventually.  Let's go to Philly.  Jeff in Philly, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hello. 
[00:40:00]  I have the perfect example for this bullshit.  I mean, I have a normal job.  I'm a middle-class guy.  I'm an electrical estimator.  I work for a company that always paid my insurance.  Always.  Never had an issue with it.  Now, all of a sudden, my insurance isn't good enough.  So I pay $800 a month.  I'm about to fucking quit my job and, you know, say fuck it, give up my nice car, get rid of my house.  You know, me and my family will live.  You're talking about being a bum, Jules.  Yeah, I mean, it's the same thing. 
[00:40:30]  How much money a month is it not going to cost you?  It's $800 a month now.  $800?  I didn't pay a thing.  I didn't pay a dime.  $800 a fucking month.  You went from not paying to $800 a month.  You can't do that.  This is what's going on out there.  You cannot do that.  All the porch, all the people.  I'm not a racist.  I'm just saying porch.  I don't like buying people.  But seriously, like, you know, it doesn't make any sense that the people that, you know,  worked hard my whole life, you know, all we feel like I'm supposed to do, you know, I 
[00:41:00]  buy my house, buy my cars, you know, I support my family, and now I got to get, you know,  screwed because my insurance, it's all right, it's not great, but it's free.  You know what I mean?  It was free.  Now it's $800 a month.  There's a million of these stories coming in.  All right, Jeff, thank you.  I want to give a couple more people a chance before we move on to something else.  Be good, Jeff.  Before we move on to the laughs.  G on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  My wife and I, she's in health care.  I'm in law enforcement. 
[00:41:30]  We both collectively make almost $200,000, and I'm not bragging.  Braggard.  I make that in an hour here.  Ooh.  Lucky.  And it's still not enough.  I mean, we're getting ready to have children here.  And on top of, you know, the mortgage, which we have a 1,500-square-foot house for $325,000,  $9,000 property taxes.  So all of that, combined with the fact that I've tried to have a baby, our health care 
[00:42:00]  has gone up.  She can't even stay home.  I mean, I make enough anywhere.  If I move anywhere, I will be able to support us.  But here we can't.  So now she's all upset because now she can't stay home with the kids.  It's just a fucking nightmare.  And capitalism has let me down.  Where's my American dream?  Well, if you achieve the American dream in any way, shape, or form, you get fucking smashed.  Yeah, I believe that.  They don't want people achieving the American dream anymore.  They want dependent leeches that need the government so that they keep their jobs and the money 
[00:42:30]  keeps rolling in.  It's just more voters.  That's all they want.  One more thing.  I work for federal law enforcement.  And today, because all the federal workers are going back, we have been told that we need  to hang out by the Social Security offices, the IRS offices, because all those motherfuckers  that didn't get their shit, didn't get their checks, they're going to be just attacking 
[00:43:00]  the Social Security offices, just complaining, violent, fighting.  Nice.  This is what it's come to.  They want to get in line, get their free...  Glad I ought to make some good World Star hip-hop videos.  Yes.  Just turn your camera the right way, please.  I know, please.  Please, landscape mode.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Carrie in Massachusetts.  Just going around the horn, as they say.  What's up, Corey?  Carrie, Carrie, what's up?  That's all right.  Hey, Massachusetts has had mandatory health insurance for quite a while, and a couple 
[00:43:30]  years ago, my husband got laid off for a little bit, but we lost our health insurance for like  a year.  Can I...  I've got to stop you.  You're not that far away from us.  Why do you sound that way?  All right.  What do you mean?  Well, you know, obviously, we worked in Boston for a little over three years, but man, we've  been in New York long enough to really hear the accent now, and you guys are...  That's great.  You're one highway away.  I can be there by noon.  I can leave right now and be there by noon.  Why do you guys sound this way? 
[00:44:00]  I don't notice it.  This is a good one, too, right?  Oh, it is.  Now I'm going to be afraid to talk.  No, no.  Now I'm going to be afraid to talk.  Everyone sounds like Sully from Godsmack.  I forgot what you were saying, because I was mesmerized by the heavy accent.  So my husband lost our health insurance.  He got laid off.  So we lost our insurance for like a year.  And when we went to go do our taxes, their solution... 
[00:44:30]  All right.  At this point, we were scraping by.  We were like...  Fuck me harder.  Harder.  Fuck me harder.  Put your cock in me and fuck me harder.  My insurance is wicked and wicked expensive.  Aw, wicked expensive.  Wicked expensive.  Everyone sounds like Susan Waldman.  Eat my ass, you cocksucker.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Oh, Barbara can't.  Oh, Barbara can't. 
[00:45:00]  Jimmy, help me out here.  Help me out here.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that she sounds lovely.  Oh, there you go.  I like that accent.  John Bonner's laughing.  Right.  Because he knew.  Crimson.  Oh, fuck.  Get down there and eat my box.  Yeah.  But they live right over there.  I'm pointing.  You can almost see their skyline.  I know.  Across the Long Island Sound, you can almost see them.  It's all another land. 
[00:45:30]  And it's just...  Wow.  Anyway.  I forgot what I was talking about now.  Oh, they find you on your taxes and pay it and make you...  Go ahead.  That's your point.  So, yeah.  So we're like two weeks from living in a cardboard box.  A cardboard box.  A cardboard box.  Almost two weeks away from living in a cardboard box.  Right here in Boffiston.  And we go to do our taxes.  And their solution to helping everybody out is they fined us $2,400. 
[00:46:00]  It's per person in your house.  Well, they should fine you for not talking properly.  Yeah.  Not speaking properly taxed.  Yeah.  Put cattle prods in your anus for accent for the adjustment therapy.  From what I understood, from where we lived, that was one of the least expensive things.  So it was like $800 a person.  That's a lot of dollars.  Dollars.  Everyone in Boston right now is like, what?  I don't get this bit you guys are doing. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, right.  I'm going to catch shit for this for a long time.  Boston is weird, though, because there's some parts of Boston where they don't talk like this.  I know.  You're right.  It's weird.  Where?  Roxbury?  No, Ant's right.  I've been in Arizona for years, and I never lost the accent.  So I'm used to getting harassed.  Anywhere near Faneuil Hall, Salvee, all that shit.  Near the water.  But as you move away from the water, you don't hear it as much.  Near the water.  The water.  Where is Salvee in Boston?  I mean, I know I've probably, I don't know if I've been through Salvee. 
[00:47:00]  Where is that?  Southeast.  Oh.  Oh, Salvee.  South part.  The south part and a bit east.  But anyway.  Is that the city?  Is that the city?  I paid out of pocket that whole year.  I paid out of pocket.  I need for my health care, for my doctor's appointments, and my kids' doctor's appointments,  and all that crap.  Johnny used to cut a hole in his pocket.  I'd put my hand in there and touch his clock.  Go to the Sox game.  I'd get my handy. 
[00:47:30]  Right through his pocket.  Hey, you don't care.  They'll find you.  When you're going to do your taxes.  One word she hasn't said yet is kid.  Yeah, yeah.  Kid.  I said kid.  Oh, you did say kid.  All right.  Yeah.  You guys love saying kid and wicked.  What's happening with your Sox?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't follow sports.  Wow.  Wow, that's a rare.  That is rare.  That is extremely rare.  Yeah.  You know, when I was a kid, I was a Yankees fan, so I took a lot of grades. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, boy.  Talking like that and rooting for the Yankees, that's rough.  Yeah.  Well, you know, the Sox stunk back in the 70s, so.  Well.  They stunk all the way up until like fucking 2000s.  Yeah.  What year was that again?  We forgot already.  03.  Was it 03?  I think.  Or what was it?  02.  03.  Maybe 03.  04.  Was it 04?  Oh, really?  Okay.  Yeah.  The curse was finally over in 04, I guess.  Tigers beat the Sox last night. 
[00:48:30]  The curse of the Pampino.  What?  What happened?  Tigers beat the Sox, so it's.  I wish.  I wish I was into playoff baseball.  Because I'm hearing these games are great.  I heard a sportscaster.  Although last night, not so much.  It was 73, but.  I heard a sportscaster call him.  And the Motor City Kitties.  Oh.  I was like, ugh.  Yeah.  The Motor City Kitties.  Playing really shitty.  That was like.  Wow.  Cringe-inducing.  That's terrible. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Even if that was the name of the team, I wouldn't say.  I know.  It's terrible.  All right, kid.  All right.  Thanks, Gary.  Thanks a lot.  Have a good one, guys.  From Boston.  What are you?  Right on, Gary.  What are you playing in Fenway Park or something?  What?  This guy's saying.  Has he seen his.  Bill went down.  Josh in D.C.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Gotta keep it fair.  Gotta keep it fair.  Yeah.  I'm just going to play the other side of this one.  I was paying.  Well, it was less.  It was about $250 a month.  And then it jacked up to $500 a month.  So it was $250 for a paycheck. 
[00:49:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  It jacked up to $500 a month before Obamacare, right?  Right, right.  Okay.  Just keep the facts straight.  Right.  Exactly.  And then the website was available.  I think it was MarylandHealth.gov.  I go on MarylandHealth.gov.  I put all my info in.  Don't worry, Ant.  They're not taking your info.  Calm down.  Of course they're not.  Yeah.  Just because you said so.  The info will never be used for anything else but this health insurance stuff.  Of course.  Because we've seen before, when you give the information to various government agencies, 
[00:50:00]  it's never used for anything else like law enforcement or tax or the guy around.  Stop.  Stop it.  What are you hiding that you are bothered by this?  I'm not.  You can find it all on one hard drive.  Yes.  I just got to find where it's headed.  It's going to be a doozy.  What do you got, Josh?  All right.  So I put all the info in and after it gives me all my choices, it actually came down to  about $170-ish a month. 
[00:50:30]  So I actually saved even more than I did prior.  All right.  So how does that happen?  And your deductible is the same?  I raised my deductible slightly.  So it's possible that because my deductible was raised, my policy went down.  I don't know.  I'm not, you know, the smartest guy.  From what to what?  From what to what?  Your deductible.  I went from $5,000 to $1,000.  Okay.  That's what it is.  The deductible is the biggest horse shit ever. 
[00:51:00]  But I rarely came up with that.  It ends up you got to pay for everything anyway.  Yeah.  Unless, God forbid, you lose a limb or...  Well, you have your deductible.  What do they call it that?  The size to fail you.  It's the fuck you, you're paying first shit.  Yeah, you're paying anyway, asshole.  Yeah.  The funny part is I never get sick, and I rarely get sick.  That'd be great if it's funny.  That'd be funny if Robert Reed said it.  That's funny.  I'm going to be aged right now for that.  How about when you go to some of these doctor's offices, and, you know, you do your thing, 
[00:51:30]  and then you go to the counter, and they go, that'll be $35?  Yeah.  I'm like, you just made that up.  You need lunch money.  Yeah, they're a little deductible, or they're a copay.  Show me the fine print.  That is $35.  Oh, but the copay is completely separate from the...  I know it is, but it seems like they just make that up, consider it.  They ask around in the morning, all right, what's the copay today?  What do you guys want?  You want sushi for a fucking lunch today?  Yeah.  They pull out that little metal filing box, and they put the money in it. 
[00:52:00]  I'm like, that's not going in your pocket.  Petty cash.  Right.  Go pay my ass.  Go pay my ass.  Exactly.  Bravo.  All right, thank you.  All right, later.  I had to go to the doctor.  Ah, that Boston accent's a hoot.  Kind of love it.  All right, I'm just going to run down, and you tell me which one you want,  because we could do this for hours.  It's unbelievable.  Obamacare.  Insurance went up.  That's Oscar in Indiana. 
[00:52:30]  Jeff in Delaware.  Middle class.  Everything's going up, which we all know.  The regular Joe.  Kevin in New Mexico.  My doctor told me he's no longer taking insurance.  He wants a retainer.  A retainer?  Like fucking a lawyer, huh?  Matt in Texas.  Solution is just don't buy the shit.  Well, then you get fucking penalty, but okay.  But how much is the penalty?  But then you're not insured, which is always a risk.  Well, you have your own insurance, and you're just paying the penalty on the other one,  which is pretty disgusting to have to pay.  I was trying to tell someone the other day.  I don't even know exactly, but I think I finally got insurance when we moved to Boston. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  I made it into my 30s without fucking health insurance.  Yeah, me too.  Everybody, right?  I had it through my job.  You were lucky.  Yeah.  You got to have it.  Radio didn't have health insurance.  No.  And you couldn't afford to go out and get it yourself?  Yeah, when you're not content out there, you need your insurance.  Oh, what the hell?  I drop something on my foot, I go right to the dock.  But the first thing they ask you for is, like, literally they won't treat you unless 
[00:53:30]  you have your papers.  They're like, yeah, you fill this out, your insurance, please.  Insurance.  They love that shit.  He doesn't want to be paying for other people's insurance.  Well, that's a popular one coming in today.  I guess we kind of did it.  Yeah, I think.  Tony in Brooklyn wants to comment on the Boston accent.  Tony in Brooklyn, what's up?  Hey, I'll come by.  You ever hear a black guy with, like, a thick New York accent or a thick Boston accent? 
[00:54:00]  Is it, why is it only white people that have that accent?  I'm trying to think.  Well, the problem is there's not a lot of black people in Boston.  Yeah, but ones that are out of Boston don't really have that whole, it's not like, ah,  I ought to go to the doctor.  Patrice was a Boston guy.  He didn't have an accent.  No.  I'm trying to, I don't know a lot of black people from Boston.  They have their own dialect.  You never even hear, like, a lot of, like, New York guys, like, you know, hey, how you  doing, you know?  Hey, how you doing? 
[00:54:30]  That's right, true.  Don't make us play that song.  They have their own black kind of dialect.  That was a funny song.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Oh, God.  Yankees.  How you doing?  Doesn't make sense to play today.  Yeah, you get down.  Oh, God, it was such a good song.  Terrible.  Laughs would come.  It was like, hey, I know that player.  Minooch.  Minooch.  Minooch.  We played this together.  Hey, Joey Baseballs.  How you doing, man?  Hey, not for nothing.  How great are the Yankees doing?  Oh, forget about it.  Oh, yeah, forget about it.  What a year it's been. 
[00:55:00]  My boy Calooch called.  He wants us to do a little something special for the fellas.  Yeah, wait a minute.  This little deal we're going to sing right now?  Wait a minute.  Here it is.  How you doing?  It was a big hit.  How you doing?  A lot of radio stations played this.  Shane Spencer.  How you doing?  How you doing?  The pink stripes.  Oh, the pink stripes.  Oh, God.  Oh, God, is that terrible. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, I hated that fucking song.  You didn't like that?  Oh, Minooch.  Minooch.  Terrible.  I went through the Obamacare.  It took my rate from $200 to $700 to be compatible.  All right.  Anyway.  But the government is up and running.  That's great.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Very good.  Business as usual.  I'm happy for the people that were out of work, certainly.  Until January, and then they get to fucking duke it out all over again.  And waste more fucking time. 
[00:56:00]  Uh-huh.  Waste everyone's time.  It is.  Big waste of time, money, resources.  Energy.  Yes, energy.  Energy.  Elbow grease.  Yep.  Oh, but the blowhards, they're on TV right now.  They all have something to say.  Right.  They all got something to say.  My side certainly isn't the problem.  Well, if you look.  Yuck.  Yeah, fucking the White House fucking press guy. 
[00:56:30]  What's his name?  Carney?  Jay Carney?  Right.  He was saying yesterday, oh, these manufactured crisis-ses, crises, manufactured crisis, manufactured  crisis, trying to put it on, you know, the other side and everything.  They're both a bunch of fucking assholes, both sides.  Fuck them all.  Absolute cocksuckers.  Yeah.  Nothing to do with the best interest of the people of this country. 
[00:57:00]  Nothing.  You know, one of our favorite people is George Wendt, right?  And you missed the great George Wendt.  Yeah.  Marvelous enemy.  It was a horrible day to not be here.  Yeah.  It was the weirdest fucking half hour of radio we've done.  Yeah.  How fucking strange it was.  Then I think we were trying to turn it into an intervention because we felt so bad for  the guy.  I'm not saying it was a good interview.  It was just a weird interview.  He's 65 today.  Ooh.  Did anyone else see the George Wendt commercial doing Da Bears? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  On the plane?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And did anyone else notice that George Wendt can't do Da Bears anymore?  He can't?  He can't do the accent.  What was he doing?  He was just doing George Wendt.  Oh.  He forgot how to do it.  You got that commercial?  Uh, I think I have the window seat.  You better double check that, my friend.  Don't think we don't know who you are.  Yeah, I'm Aaron Rodgers.  No, that's not it.  You're that State Farm discount double check guy.  Discount double check. 
[00:58:00]  Thanks to the hundreds you saved us, we could upgrade the grill class.  Grill class?  Your times are in your seat back.  Save with the discount.  The other guy's really playing it.  The other guy knows how to do the accent.  George Wendt can do it if it's a couple words.  Yeah, yeah.  But if he has to say a sentence, he can't do the fucking voice.  That's a terrible commercial.  That is a bad one.  Da Bears.  What was that about?  I don't know.  I swear I don't know.  State Farm insurance.  Oh, State Farm insurance. 
[00:58:30]  That's a fucking insurance commercial.  Aaron Rodgers on a plane, and they fold down their fold-out trays, and there's fucking  food cooking on it.  That would be crazy, Jimmy.  How is that insurance?  What a hazard that would be.  Yeah, the food would get all mushy.  Oh, there could be a fire in the cabin.  Absolutely.  Very unsafe practice.  You raised a good point, Anthony.  Why would the quarterback be sitting in coach in the goddamn middle seat when he has to  go throw a ball?  I love annoying Redskins fans by suggesting new names for the team. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  What have you suggested so far?  I think the Washington Hard Workers is good.  Hard Workers?  Yeah, the Washington Good Guys.  Come on.  How about the Washington Touchdown Makers?  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Root for your team.  Yeah.  You see the political cartoon today?  Uh-uh.  I gotta find it.  I forgot what paper it was in.  Ooh.  I might even tweet it.  It just drove me nuts.  They're comparing the Redskins logo to the swastik. 
[00:59:30]  That's awesome.  And the Confederate flag.  Oh.  What's wrong with the Confederate flag?  I kind of stink.  I'm done with that flag.  You don't like the Confederate flag?  Enough of them.  I like it.  Fucking dumb Dixie pride.  Stinks.  Don't go to Atlanta.  Here it is.  Holy crap.  Archaic symbols of pride and heritage.  And all it is is the swastika, the Confederate flag, and then now the Redskins logo.  There it is.  That's comparable, right?  Wow. 
[01:00:00]  I don't know.  Because Chief Wahoo is worse.  At least the Redskins is a regal picture of an Indian guy.  Chief Wahoo is a fucking Sambo cartoon with a red face.  It really is Sambo.  It's Sambo.  With an Indian face.  He needs bigger lips and a watermelon.  That's exactly what that looks like.  That's the cartooning that is.  Yeah.  That's fucking repulsive.  Ooh.  I'll tweet this shit.  That's unbelievable.  Swastika.  Yeah.  Let's see the NFL just get... 
[01:00:30]  Again, I'll respect you guys.  And you're in the Redskins.  Just get brave and do it to someone else.  And I'll be 100% behind your right to...  I mean, you can do it, but I'll support you.  Although a swastika would make a great logo on the side of a helmet, wouldn't it?  On the side of a football helmet.  It kind of fits perfectly.  Round thing.  You would be scared to play that team.  Isn't that right?  Imagine that.  The fucking...  You know, the Washington Nazis.  And they just get out there.  How offensive would that be?  Holy shit.  It would make watching sports a lot of fun. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my God.  Just imagine what some of the teams could be.  Oh.  Yeah.  If there was no political correctness...  Oh, wow.  ...whatsoever.  Man.  Oh, some of these teams could be really bad.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I like that the Redskins are hanging in there.  More of the bears.  Is that one worse?  State Farm.  I don't even know.  I hate these...  That wasn't even the one I saw where he was doing the accent really bad.  But you could...  Yeah, whatever.  Don't you hate these commercials that are now fucking like real stories?  I'm not interested in a State Farm commercial. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, Jim.  I like keeping up on the characters.  Two fat guys eating hot dogs.  Wait.  This is a long one.  That's what I'm saying.  It drives me nuts.  Let's hear it.  It sounds hilarious.  I'm sure.  I love the bears thing.  The tailgate, they're calling it.  So I saved enough cash with a discount double check to buy a new smartphone.  Does it work?  Oh.  Let's see.  Smarty, what is the meaning of life?  Ditka.  Ask another one. 
[01:02:00]  Smarty, what time is it?  Ditka.  Works nice.  That'll come in handy.  It's a nice item.  Oh, boy.  You really should consider seeing a cardiologist.  Guess it don't work.  Yeah.  Too bad.  It's hilarious, right?  Yeah.  That just is abominable.  You don't like it?  How can you?  It's cute.  I get it.  Ditka.  How fucking old is that reference? 
[01:02:30]  We get it.  Ditka.  Hey, the bears.  When did they do that on SNL?  It's got to be fucking 20 years ago.  Was he on SNL?  Early 90s, maybe?  You know what he did?  Yeah.  Yeah, he did his time on there.  That bears enough already with the Chicago.  We get it.  He would come in and do a skit or two and then move on.  Because Farley was in that bit.  Farley was hilarious and everything.  Farley used to be in that bit.  Even in a bad skit, Chris Farley was great.  Oh, yeah.  Just going back and grabbing fucking 20-year-old.  Yeah.  What are they doing? 
[01:03:00]  Because they're getting lazy.  Oh.  Extremely lazy.  We get the accent.  We know.  That's what they like in Chicago.  Yeah, Ditka.  Yeah, we heard you.  We got it.  Didn't make these other coach do it?  Deep dish pizza.  Yeah, it's windy.  That'd be a great commercial.  His Chicago accent.  Yeah.  And the guy gets blown off the Sears Tower.  What did you say, Iraq?  I have a clip from when I'm hungry.  Sorry, Iraq. 
[01:03:30]  That's not fair.  I have a clip from when George Wendt was on the show where it got really awkward.  Oh, good.  Alcoholism.  How far?  How old?  Sorry.  Yes.  My mic.  He just threw me off.  I was thinking.  How long is it?  It's about a minute.  Yeah, let's hear this.  How much do you despise cell phones and beepers and all that shit?  It's all right.  It doesn't bother me that much.  But it's pretty funny how they go off sometimes.  It's got to go.  I really haven't hit one thing that George relates to.  I suck.  My apologies, Mr. Wendt. 
[01:04:00]  No, it was a fine interview.  But pause this.  They're saying he really...  I got to explain.  We use it with almost every person that he's got to go.  Uh-huh.  And this was one of those occasions where he did not have to go.  They're telling us he's got to go.  Right.  We had to get him out of there.  It was bumming everybody out.  And we tried everything to get something going.  He wasn't a fun guy?  Well, listen to his delivery.  Really low.  He didn't want to be there.  Plug in a book on beer. 
[01:04:30]  How long are we going to talk about that?  Right.  Right.  So, um, which has a better head on it?  Go.  All right.  Go back to the clip.  Back it up slightly and just play it out.  I really haven't hit one thing that George relates to.  I suck.  My apologies, Mr. Wendt.  Well, it was a fine interview, but they're saying he really has to go.  I don't know what you're talking about, but if you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  I thought I was here until 8.30.  Oh.  We're waiting a word. 
[01:05:00]  Unless I misheard, I was told he had to be somewhere at 8.30.  Ah, see?  See, George?  I wasn't giving you the hook.  Peachy.  We were.  What's going on?  Did the rock jump on the grenade there?  You don't care.  Nice.  What happened?  I don't know.  Oh.  I really...  I don't think George is happy, and I like George.  I don't feel like he's happy.  I don't know why.  I don't want you to be upset with us.  Yeah, I'm fine.  And then he left.  The best part is we said what happened as he's still in the room. 
[01:05:30]  Wow.  What happened?  Yeah, he was a bit of a dud.  It was a weird day with him, man.  It was just strange.  Oof.  Hey, don't give off that energy and not expect people to address it.  Right.  And we tried.  We tried to pump him up.  We were excited to meet George Wendt.  Of course.  You didn't say, hey, how was it working on that cheers there?  I think I asked him when he blew through the money.  Hey.  Oh, yeah.  Did he?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  I'm sure we asked cheers questions.  Hey, how was Ted dancing?  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Does everybody know your name or what?  I laughed at him.  Eric.  Yeah.  People want an update.  Did you get that fucking money home yesterday?  250 pounds of quarters?  Some of it is at the house.  Some of it is in the bank.  Why are you on some of it in the bank?  Because they wouldn't take all of it.  How can a fucking bank not take U.S. currency?  Wow.  They could accept the currency.  They said they didn't have the room for all those boxes of quarters. 
[01:06:30]  In a bank?  That's a bank.  What, do you go to a photomat bank to drive through banking?  Well, he would use a piggy bank.  Of course.  How could the fucking bank not take your quarters?  Because everything has to be just annoying in life.  I had to explain.  How hard could it be to take the fucking quarters back?  You have to explain a fucking thing to them.  This is U.S. currency, cocksuckers.  Take it.  I had to explain for 15 minutes why I had these boxes, where I got them from, 
[01:07:00]  and they got my bank account information so that they could apply it towards my account,  and I would be held responsible.  They should have taken it.  A hundred percent.  How did they not take that fucking money?  They said they didn't have the room for it.  So really, if you brought in stacks of cash that were that big,  they wouldn't have had room for it?  What are you talking about?  Room?  I mean, it was heavy was the problem.  It weighed 250 pounds for real.  It was $5,000 in quarters. 
[01:07:30]  Just to update the people that maybe don't know what the fuck's going on.  And it was...  What kind of box would that fit in if...  Yeah.  Like, I'm trying to think.  Typical moving box.  It would fit in with room to spare.  Like that United States Postal Service bin.  A milk crate.  A large milk crate, sure.  They don't have room for a large milk crate in their bank.  In their vault.  How many did they take?  They took four of the ten boxes.  Fuck.  How can they do it?  Four?  How can they only have room for like a shoebox worth of quarters? 
[01:08:00]  That's what I was trying to figure out.  Did you ask for the bank manager?  Yeah.  That was the one...  That was the lady who was helping me.  And she said, we can't...  And she said, I can only take four of these right now and told me to come back next week  and she could take the rest of them.  Do you know what that's about?  I know.  They don't want to fucking count them.  They don't...  That particular lady on her shift didn't want to deal with it.  Yeah.  So she's like, fuck, I got to take some of it.  All right, I'll take four.  I could do four of these today.  Because they got to open up the fucking...  Each wrapper and count the shit. 
[01:08:30]  I would have weighing them as possible.  They want you to look and establish that they're all quarters.  You could...  I'm sure you could weigh them, but you'd have to open everything still.  Yeah, what if you have them in there, but it's like they're slugs and the antlers are  on the quarters.  You didn't weigh the chain, did you, Doc?  That lady did not want to be bothered.  They opened the four boxes to visually inspect every roll.  They didn't open the rolls, but they looked at every side and everything.  That's U.S. currency.  How the fuck can they not take that in a bank?  That makes me... 
[01:09:00]  The quarters...  They just said they didn't have...  They didn't say they couldn't take it because of the currency.  They couldn't take it because they didn't have the room for all those words.  Did you have to write your account number on every roll?  No.  I used to roll pennies and do that.  Yeah?  Yeah, I would write my account number.  I bought change rolling machines.  Why would he want to write on himself?  Oh, no.  That wasn't even good.  Oh.  I know, but I got excited.  It's all about timing, but I still thought I could squeeze that one in.  You're right, though.  Oh, Iraq. 
[01:09:30]  Sorry.  You roll pennies?  I did.  Nothing worse than rolling pennies.  It takes just as long as quarters and shit.  How about when you get it all together and then you kind of push too hard and they go  flying everywhere?  Oh, my God.  That's enraging.  I got to start over.  Or they all tilt sideways in the fucking...  Or one is tilted sideways.  You're like, no, this isn't full.  It's all gushy, gushy in the middle.  Because one is fucking standing up on end, flicking it. 
[01:10:00]  You got to flick it.  I used to collect change to fucking eat for real.  And you had to roll that shit up.  Oh, yeah.  So irritating.  How annoying was that?  I remember going through pockets and coats and fucking down the couch.  You fucking just looking for change.  You find a quarter.  It's like, oh, nice.  You got quarter rolls?  We got some quarters that got to roll up.  Yeah.  Remember?  And they would hand them over to you.  You go home and...  We used to steal the change boxes out of the laundromat.  How'd you do that?  With fucking screwdrivers. 
[01:10:30]  We would go down and...  Oh, Jesus.  That's a real crime, Jim Norton.  Yeah.  For what reason?  For your drugs?  I think to drink, yeah.  Oh, man.  How much would you get?  A few bucks.  Not much.  But enough to maybe buy booze.  That's scary.  Well, then again, it's not because it was before cameras.  Oh, yeah.  There are still people that don't realize that there's cameras everywhere.  Everywhere.  It amazes me.  They just commit crimes right in front of the cameras.  It's just like, here you go.  Here's me.  You pretty much get everyone now.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Looking right at it.  Here's the face of the guy.  Right. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  It's nice.  So they only took four.  They only took four.  And today I'm going to try to find a different branch of the bank to see if they'll take the  rest.  How about you go back to the same bank and go, all right, now it's time to take more of  my money.  I don't have the room.  You should have asked yourself.  These were stacks of hundreds.  You wouldn't have them.  Yeah, I should have, but I didn't think about it.  And then you know what the answer would be?  Oh, yeah.  We got a banker that's going to explain.  Okay.  There's no way there's a real explanation.  Jeff, go ahead, buddy. 
[01:11:30]  Hi, Jeff.  Jeff?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Hey, what do you got on this?  Hi.  This is weird.  Yeah, well, what it is is when a bank takes in that much currency, they don't need it.  They don't need it in their...  Oh, shit.  Your phone's crapping out.  We might have another guy.  There's a few people who want to explain.  Okay.  Matt in Jersey.  Go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hi, buddy.  Yo.  Yeah, so a lot of times, banks can't take that amount of money, like the product callers 
[01:12:00]  are saying, because they're limited to the amount of cash they can have in their vault.  And it's not like they have these gigantic vaults.  And if they do take that, they have to ship it out, which costs them money for the weight  of the extra coin.  So there's a bunch of different things that come into it.  That sounds like horseshit.  That sounds like horseshit.  The banks are pretty much raping us, so how about you take the 250 pounds of quarters?  How can they not take your money?  Right.  I agree.  I mean, and I work for it, and I've been on the retail side of the bank, and I've had  to turn people away for the same reason.  Is that legal? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because legally, each bank is limited to the amount of cash they can have in their vault  at any given time.  But this is only five grand.  We're only talking five grand, right?  Yeah.  If I wanted to come in and deposit ten grand into my account, and I came in with cash,  they wouldn't take it?  They would, but they'd have to do a CPR, because it's anything ten thousand and over.  All right.  No, we know that.  We know that.  Let's say it's nine thousand dollars.  Jesus.  Missed the details.  Ten thousand in cash, which is a lot less than ten thousand in coins.  It's five thousand in coins. 
[01:13:00]  Who cares what the weight is?  What's heavier?  A ton of bricks or a ton of feathers?  Anyone?  Or Iraq?  They're talking extra money to ship out that weight.  When the truck comes to pick up coins, that extra coin they have, they're actually paying  extra money.  So what?  So what?  That's the business they've chosen.  They're a bank.  They take money.  Here's money.  The life we have chosen.  Yeah.  Keep your money overseas.  That is fucking despicable.  That's ridiculous.  The banks aren't doing us a favor these days. 
[01:13:30]  Not even close.  No interest.  They're cock-sucking vultures.  They pay no interest.  Not even close.  I agree.  All right, Matt.  Thank you, sir.  I obviously can't say what I would love to have happen.  And this is not to guys like Matt who just work in the bank.  But to the people that make those decisions for the banks, I would love crowds to drag  them out of the bank or out of their offices and pull them in the street and do certain  things.  Oh, yes.  To their heinies? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  And their heads?  Nice.  What about their heinies, though?  No, heads first.  And then heinies.  Damn.  Really?  Yeah.  Like Gaddafi.  Didn't Gaddafi have something shoved up his ass?  Might have.  Can we say he shoved something in his, oh, heinie hole?  In his heinie.  It's heinie.  Can I see your heinie?  Mine heinie?  Heinie.  Can I see your heinie?  A weird word.  We did the weird word bit, right?  Oh, yeah.  He's on that list.  Heine.  You just sound like a complete idiot when he's saying heinie. 
[01:14:30]  Can I see your heinie?  My cabbie yesterday, there was a girl with a fucking tight white dress, and she was doing  it.  There was a camera.  She was just standing there waiting.  She was, like, shooting something.  Maybe a commercial or a model or whatever.  What a rump.  Oh.  And the cabbie, we were stopped at the light.  I'm just staring.  And I was, oh, he's an Indian guy.  And I'm like, oh, look at her heinie.  And he couldn't stop chuckling at that naughtiness of the word heinie.  That's creepy when it's put in that context.  Oh, her ass was fantastic.  Was it?  Yeah.  Oh.  Just smell it. 
[01:15:00]  Oh.  Kiss it.  So that's the update on the coins, I guess, huh, Eric?  Anything else from yesterday?  No.  Just arms were sore from lugging that everywhere.  Yeah, well, it's about time you do an honest day's work.  There you go.  The video came out all right.  The best part of the video is when Kenny does the big reveal and dumps your money on the  floor.  The whole room and the camera just jolts and shakes.  It's very heavy.  It's the funniest thing on the whole fucking video, man.  You put it up on our Facebook page.  Sure. 
[01:15:30]  You haven't yet?  No.  Why?  Why not?  Because I forgot to do that.  Oh, man.  You're fired.  Yeah, people want to see that.  All right.  They want to see the big payoff of the dumb bit.  Although it wasn't a bit in the beginning.  Yeah.  I will hold to that.  Tell her to answer the phone, Norton and friends, from now on.  Okay.  Sorry, guys.  What could Kenny and Dennis Falcone possibly be talking about?  I know what it is, if you want to know.  Really?  Normally, one will suck the other one's cock, and then he'll go down and give five sucks. 
[01:16:00]  One, two.  And Dennis went first twice the other day.  Oh, okay.  Right.  Because Kenny was eating cotton balls.  Let's find out what they're talking about.  I'd love to know, like, because Kenny looks interested.  I don't know how Danny pours the shit out of everybody.  I'll bet you Danny's a big top.  Danny!  What are you talking about out there?  You think he's a top?  Yeah, he's scolding Kenny and threatening to spank his bottom.  Make him kiss his feet.  That was more than just a friendly hello.  Yeah, what was going on there, Kenny?  You and Dennis Falcone having quite the little conversation there. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, I'm interested in learning how to spin and scratch.  What?  He's a DJ.  Uh-huh.  What are you really talking about?  You know.  I do?  Yeah.  Anything good?  Yeah.  Does it rhyme with mumming inside of each other?  Oh, you're writing it down.  Top super shit going on. 
[01:17:00]  There we go.  N-I-O-K.  Oh, wow, that's...  What?  Oh, okay.  Oh, he's a marvelous actor.  We have to keep that quiet, right?  Yep.  For now.  For now.  Yep.  We might be working on something.  Yeah.  Finally.  We're going to break.  Are we doing Jocktober today?  Oh, I hope so.  And Mike Buschetti's coming in today.  He's a weird dude.  Yeah.  I like him.  He's the...  He's strange, though.  He's like the announcer guy on Artie's show. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  He's a fucking sucker.  Oh.  You read the excerpts from the Rolling Stone article on Artie?  I have not.  I saw him last night, though.  I tweeted last week, I think, or early this week.  Holy F.  He thanked us for talking about his book.  Oh.  Artie, I saw him last night.  I bumped into him last night.  And he's like, hey, man.  You guys talked about the book.  Thank you.  Of course we did.  Yeah.  And, you know, we'd have him on in a second, because people have been asking, but that's  up to him.  Yeah.  We get the politics of the whole thing, but we'd have him on in a second to promote Crash 
[01:18:00]  and Burn.  He's being pretty damn honest.  Holy fuck.  Wow.  Is he?  He was chugging bleach as he's stabbing himself, bleeding all over the fucking apartment.  Chugging bleach?  Chugging bleach is in the article.  Slit his wrist.  Slit his wrist.  And then sat on his couch to look at the view of the Hudson.  Oh, you read it, too?  Yeah.  And then the only thing that saved him was his mom came over, supposedly, with Colin Quinn.  Has Colin ever told you this part of the story?  No.  Because it's in the article that they were coming over for some kind of intervention. 
[01:18:30]  And that's the only reason that he was saved.  Wow.  No, I didn't know Colin was there.  He didn't call it an official intervention, but some kind of, I forgot exactly how he worded  it, but it was sort of an intervention.  Wow.  His mom and Colin Quinn and a few other people were coming over.  I think his sister.  Oh.  And they found him like that.  And that's the only, pretty much the only reason he's still alive.  I know he drank bleach.  Fuck.  Wow.  It's pretty amazing.  Is the whole article out?  Or did I read the whole article? 
[01:19:00]  I felt like I read the whole article.  No, you just read some excerpts from it online.  Really?  I don't know if the whole article was out yet.  I haven't read his first book.  I should read the first one first.  Yeah.  This will be another number one bestseller.  He had the number one bestseller in the Times.  Yeah.  So.  Horrific shit.  Yeah.  All right.  When's it out, by the way?  Do you know November?  The new book?  I don't know.  I would assume very soon.  Oh.  I remember he was supposed to be on the Bob Saget roast. 
[01:19:30]  And we all had Artie Lang jokes.  Oh.  And then he didn't come.  But he's one of the people.  Who got hit with a lot of Artie Lang fat jokes?  I forget who got pummeled with them.  Oh.  How to use them.  In absentia.  Somebody got fucking smashed with them.  Wow.  With John Lovitz and a couple of other people that just didn't deserve it.  I crushed him.  Just someone that was just a little pudgy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Didn't really deserve the fat jokes. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Someone that put on five.  Right.  All of a sudden got assaulted on television.  Travis, you got something over there?  Hmm?  You got something over there?  Yes.  You want to know when the book was out?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's AIDS.  Yeah, exactly.  A lump.  Terrible.  Why would you guys say that?  A small softball on his neck.  That is terrible.  A week.  All right.  So we're about 12 days out.  Yeah.  And then the...  Oh, God damn it.  I hate a brown banana.  Look at that.  That's a horrible banana.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Oh.  Ew.  It split up the middle. 
[01:20:30]  Ew.  There's something wrong with that banana.  I wouldn't eat it.  Yeah, I wouldn't eat that shit.  I'd say, when in doubt, throw it out.  Yeah.  Go get me another banana, York.  Showtime.  I don't know.  Ew.  There's something terribly wrong with that banana.  Bananas are terrible.  I love a banana.  They're very healthy.  No, no one loves a banana.  They're overrated.  I love a good banana.  You will eat a banana.  No one loves a banana.  How many delicious foods can you fuck yourself in the ass with first?  Yams are terrible. 
[01:21:00]  Zucchinis are terrible.  Oh, sure, they feel good going in and even better coming out.  I like an unripened banana better than a ripe banana.  What?  In every way, shape, and form.  Jesus.  That's a great example.  That's a great fucking thing to say in court.  Yeah.  Why don't you black out your van windows?  Well.  Yeah, like a banana that's still a little like unripened. 
[01:21:30]  Not green, but not at all turning like brownish.  You're getting those speckles yet.  Yeah.  Wow.  You know when bananas get brown when they're in your fridge?  Like I'll, uh...  Funny story, guys.  They get brown before you take them fucking home.  It's crazy.  You get out of the car.  It's a fragile fruit that is.  Yeah, what the fuck's wrong with them?  In the fridge, though, they get browned faster.  Put it on your counter for two minutes.  It's a standalone fruit.  What, it gets sad because it's not what it's friends anymore?  It's bunch.  Right?  What the fuck happens? 
[01:22:00]  It's a bunch.  I love a banana, though.  You chop it up.  Very healthy.  No one loves a banana.  I'm telling you.  I like it with peanut butter.  I like it in my oatmeal.  A good banana.  What a treat.  I like a good ripe plum.  I like a good ripe plum.  Plums.  I like a good ripe plum.  Plums are great.  They're either so sour, or they're...  I couldn't think of a reference, but they're just extraordinarily sour.  I like delicious.  That's another fruit you've got to buy perfectly.  Because if it is sour, that's brutal.  And if it's over-sweetened, then you get some of the rotty fucking parts. 
[01:22:30]  I don't want that.  You've got to fucking time fruit perfectly.  It's ridiculous.  Jesus Christ.  The Mackinac Peaches, Jerry.  The Mackinac Peaches.  Seinfeld?  Yes, of course.  How about a nectarine?  I like nectarine.  I enjoy a good nectarine.  I don't know.  But I want a better banana.  That was unacceptable.  Taking your calls, everyone, about what fruit you like.  Yes.  Here on the...  I guess we're doing Jacktober?  Yeah, right now.  I know.  That's what we're doing.  That was the... 
[01:23:00]  This is fucking plain oatmeal.  This is what they serve on the boat in Roots.  It's fucking terrible.  Starbucks has the worst oatmeal.  That was a good boat movie.  I see the boat movie.  Oh, they at least decided to make it today.  A lot of days, they don't even really make it for you.  No?  They just throw it all in a fucking...  That looks so watery.  That just looks like...  It looks disgusting.  It's horrible.  But if you're trying to eat healthy...  Eat your mush.  Eat your mush, Spanky.  Oatmeal without the milk.  Just water.  I get water. 
[01:23:30]  I like a nice plain oatmeal.  But you sprinkle in a couple of cranberries and some bananas.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's a good cranberry.  Me too.  I can't eat too many.  Do you like a craisin?  I love craisins.  I don't know what they are.  Cranberry raisins.  No, but I don't...  I've never had one.  Oh, God.  Oh, they mutated.  I've never had one.  They mutated the two and made a craisin.  That's a craisin.  Oh, that's like the fucking French bulldog of fruit.  Just...  I don't know about my dog.  My fucking poor dog.  They make a non-breathing dog.  Exactly.  That's what it sounds. 
[01:24:00]  Exactly.  That's what I heard in my house.  That's what I heard in my ear last night.  It's trying to sleep on me.  Whose dog snores?  Oh, crazy.  You're a dog with apnea.  That's fucking terrible.  Yeah.  And he knows he has to prop his mouth open with a bone to breathe.  Why do they...  I don't...  French bulldogs are adorable, but it's a very cruel breed of dog.  Yeah.  Like, all bulldog breeds are cruel.  They're just man-made.  But...  They can't even give birth properly.  They have...  They're all C-sections.  So why would they do that?  Bulldogs wouldn't think that it's cruel, because that's the only way they would be able to 
[01:24:30]  live.  Yeah, they know.  Wait, the bulldogs, are they created as well?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, they were.  They're man-made, man-bred.  Like, what are we doing?  There's enough fucking regular dogs that can...  We love cuteness.  Yeah, that's why we created the...  The...  The...  The...  What's that poodle?  Labradoodle?  Yeah, like...  But the difference between...  Those things rule.  If you create a dog that's hypoallergenic, but it doesn't affect the...  The dog's ability to breathe, I don't think that's cruel.  They've been around for like a hundred years, too.  It's not like we did it yesterday. 
[01:25:00]  Why don't they stop with French Bulldogs?  Let them go.  Then how am I going to get some?  You don't need them.  They're mean.  I mean, I know you love your dog, but they're cruel.  Get a fucking dog that just breathes right.  All I want is a dog that does this.  A lab.  Like a nice Labrador retriever.  A golden retriever.  Anything.  Exactly.  Exactly.  It's like...  Constantly suffocating.  Every dog...  French Bulldog, he always sounds like David Carradine right before he died.  Thick in his hand.  It's nice.  He's got a Luca Brasi dog.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  You didn't like it when he was at your house?  Yeah.  No, he was very loud.  Travis's Bulldog showed me.  He goes here all the time.  Johnny Ola, because he was choked.  Put a knife through his little paw at the bar.  Choke him.  I want a dog.  But I'm allergic.  A lot of work.  Get a hypoallergenic.  Well, the problem with those is I don't want a dog where it looks like they had their hair  done.  Because you look like...  It kind of looks silly walking around New York. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  Are poodles...  Those giant poodles are kind of cute.  I like them.  No.  They're vicious.  The big poodles are cool.  Those big poodles are vicious.  You're constantly taking them down to the beauty parlor.  That's what I'm saying.  Get their dumb hair done.  Got to clean the shit out of the back of their fucking firm.  Oh, yes.  Thank you, no.  With your tongue.  Absolutely.  With your cock.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Can you imagine if somebody walked in and you were fucking talking and said, what are  you doing?  And you said, I'm cleaning his anus. 
[01:26:30]  There's a tissue on the end of my dick.  I'm wiping his eye.  What a bad excuse that is.  Oh, that is horrible.  We got a teller on the phone that's really mad at the other bank guy.  I love these calls.  All right.  Let's get him on here.  He has a problem with the other guy.  Go ahead, Mikey.  Of course he does.  Hey, how's it going?  What's up, Jersey City?  Yeah, I'm an asshole.  I'm one of those guys that has to disagree with the other one. 
[01:27:00]  That guy didn't know what he was talking about.  Not necessarily an asshole.  I actually like these calls.  Go ahead.  No, I was talking for a long time.  And we used to have to be able to take anything from homeless people to strippers and anything.  So...  Yeah, you're a bank.  That's your job.  Who gives a fuck how the money comes in?  Half you guys launder money for cocaine dealers.  How about you take fucking fat kids' quarters?  Oh, man.  That was exactly it.  You know?  Like, we used to have to take anything. 
[01:27:30]  So, like, when the strippers came in, you used to have to fucking take homeless people  with strippers or anything.  It was the sunspots, huh?  I guess.  The sunspots?  Yeah.  Little red dots on the back of the underpants.  So, yeah.  You used to suck.  I mean...  All right.  That was a wonderful phone call.  Thank you.  Strippers and homeless people four times.  Yeah.  Yeah, we get it.  This guy breeds Labradoodles. 
[01:28:00]  He gets paid $900 every three months when they have a litter.  Aw.  How big are the little Labradoodles?  They don't...  Terrible.  Oh, they're cute, though.  No, they're not.  All those small dogs.  No, but I don't mind a big dog.  But, I mean, it's like, I can't breathe.  I can't enjoy a dog.  I don't...  I don't like the responsibility with a dog.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So, you get a French Bulldog, you just walk them for five minutes and they're tired.  That doesn't matter.  The five-minute walk is like, you have to fucking get your shit on.  It's fucking cold out. 
[01:28:30]  If it's a blizzard, you still got to trudge out there and do...  Fuck that.  Yeah, why don't you breed a quadriplegic and just drag it around by the hips?  Put two fucking...  Those things that you hold corn and a cob with and fucking drag them around by the hips.  Why would you do that?  Exactly.  It's cruel.  Terrible.  You wouldn't.  You want to talk cruelty to dogs?  Sure.  How about the guys and the gals that go for a jog with their dogs? 
[01:29:00]  Their little feet can't keep up.  Oh, they...  That's okay if you're running to your mailbox or whatever, but they go on real runs with  their dogs.  Yeah.  I'm trying to imagine what the human equivalent would be to that.  Man, it's somebody fucking pulling you with a car.  Right, right.  You're trying to fucking keep up.  There it is.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It's gotta be.  It'd be terrible.  I hate those people.  Like, the dog is... 
[01:29:30]  You're gonna kill your dog.  You can't keep up with that shit.  You can't even see their legs.  No, man.  It's just a blur.  That's when you realize how long dogs' tongues are, because they are, like, fucking dying.  Yeah.  They're gasping.  What is Fox Business News just getting to the what does the Fox...  What does the Fox say?  That's probably their tagline, like, during certain things.  What does the Fox say?  And then Fox says something.  I think they were on, like, Good Morning America yesterday, or the Today Show. 
[01:30:00]  They're pretty much done.  I mean, come on, really?  Yeah, but it's still funny.  Well...  No?  It's no I love Chinese food.  No.  Yeah.  That's a good song.  I don't know that.  It's true.  Or Thanksgiving.  Oh.  And the staffing.  Oh.  Potatoes.  The turkey.  What is that song?  It couldn't be a real song.  What's the purpose of that?  For that black producer guy to make money.  Yeah.  But, I mean, how does he make money off it? 
[01:30:30]  Thank you very much.  Oh!  He charges them to make it.  And then I'm sure he gets a cut of the YouTube advertising.  It's his YouTube account.  But why would people watch this?  Yeah, it's his YouTube account.  Why would people watch it?  It's heinous.  Because that's why they watch it.  Why do you watch beheading videos?  Because I get a hard-on.  Same thing.  He just found his in.  That's all.  He's got everyone.  We're talking about it.  I'm going to write a song like this.  Yeah.  For Halloween.  Really? 
[01:31:00]  What are you going to?  The masks.  It's very hard to say masks.  The masks.  I'm getting faced on Twitter.  Dogs run faster than humans.  Some do.  I've never seen a dog go for a three-mile run.  That's my point.  Well, the tiny little dogs.  Like when they take a little Yorkie out or something.  What about like a...  If you have a German Shepherd, you're going to get tired before he does.  Well, they know they can't run for three miles. 
[01:31:30]  They don't do it.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not...  I'm talking about these people.  I see them in Central Park doing the loop with a dog.  It's a long way.  You don't think like regular-sized dogs, though, are into it?  They've got to be exhausted from a three-mile run with a human being.  They like to run, though.  I bet dogs can outrun...  I bet the worst out-of-shape dog can outrun the best in-shape human.  Three miles.  There's a story about how some dog got out a couple weeks ago, and he ended up running  a half marathon, just like with the people.  And it's just nothing. 
[01:32:00]  I'm a dog.  The entire like 13 miles.  Really?  Yeah.  We have four legs.  I might have to give up on this concept, I guess.  Do you think dogs, really?  They gave them a mess.  I know the little ones are like, that looks sad.  Where it sounds like twinkle toes?  They can't keep up.  Yeah.  Tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a.  Little legs going.  Most people are exhausted after a three-mile run.  Hey, ladies.  Yeah, I mean...  What's up?  They're the girls.  They're all going together.  Hey, lady.  Majority of those people were men, I think.  What?  That's the morning mashup, right?  Did you ever hear them talk?  Yeah, the gals.  Things they talk about?  I guess you're right. 
[01:32:30]  Are they throwing the ball around today?  A little bit here and there, sure.  Tossing it around.  Tossing it around.  Talking some pop culture.  Yeah.  How funny was it when I saw you in the office yesterday?  It wasn't funny.  The mashup laughed.  I didn't.  Got a polite morning mashup laugh.  Stan and Nicole.  Ha ha, Jim.  What did you say to Sam?  I leaned in.  Yeah.  I said, traitor.  Hang on with a different show.  Little office jokes.  Oh, they laughed.  And then Nicole and Stan went, ha ha ha ha ha. 
[01:33:00]  Little office joke.  Little office jokes.  At least you got Jim.  I got Craig yesterday in the office.  Ah.  I'm eating my old pill.  It's got too much moisture.  Okay.  That's great.  Did you enjoy it?  All right.  No, I didn't.  It was a bad visit.  I think it's break time.  Yeah.  I've got to talk about some stuff.  It's break time.  That's a good salt effect.  It's potato.  We're going to talk about the house stenographer after the break.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She kind of lost her mind.  Yeah.  And we got a new Mike Francesa clip. 
[01:33:30]  Thank God.  It's been way too long.  Oh, nice.  We've gone over a week without playing Mike Francesa.  Did we play his Redskins clip we talked about?  Not really.  Because there's a lot on it.  He did about an hour and a half.  But now, he is saying he is part Native American.  What?  Can you find that clip?  That one.  We should play.  Chris Russo's going crazy over this on Twitter.  Good for Chris Russo.  Yeah.  Good for him.  And he said it rolls right off the tongue.  What does?  Redskins.  Oh, boy. 
[01:34:00]  So, he's supporting the owner, right?  Oh, yeah.  Good.  Good for him fucking Chris.  Did he support the fucking...  I don't know.  The guy in Philadelphia who said nigger at the Kenny Chesney concert?  No.  I'm saying.  Probably.  No, he didn't.  None of them did.  Oh, hey, hey.  Say sorry.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sensitivity.  At a Kenny Chesney concert.  It's like, what did he preface that word with?  I'll give you $1,000 if you could find a...  Kenny Chesney, please. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  His dog pulls him on his longboard five miles every day.  He weighs 200 pounds.  Wow.  I'm way off on this one.  Dogs are pretty...  What about them fucking...  The ones for the Iditarod.  True.  The Iditarod.  The Iditarod.  They fucking...  Yeah.  Sled dogs.  Hook them up to the sled and fucking...  All right.  You don't have to make me feel bad about this.  They slush.  Yeah.  It was just a dumb concept that I thought we could have fun with.  You don't throw a bone to a dog and have him just look at it and go, I'm too tired. 
[01:35:00]  They fetch all day.  All right.  I hope he's talking about some fucking 15-year-old dog with hip dysplasia.  Exactly.  Fucking tumors.  The dog from Mice and Men.  They fucking shot in the field.  Fucking Curly's dog.  Whatever his name was.  Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.  No, not that one.  Oh.  Of course.  We got a break.  We've been at it on just two hours.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Almost.  Let's do that.  Heck of a long day, okay?  All right.  We'll get in some even better shit after these messages. 
[01:35:30]  Have a real bright back, guys.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On SiriusXM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The guys are back from the toilet.  Now, back to our show.  One more time for a bit.  I'm set to trade.  Drop that beat.  Scratch that break.  Just blow a little bit.  That smoke's my way.  M&M.  Happy birthday, 41.  M&M's 41? 
[01:36:00]  What happened?  He's got his name on a channel right next door to us, and we've never seen the guy.  No.  How do you get that deal?  I want that deal.  Who's that bad?  Well, we have our name up on the studio right next to his, and he's never seen us either.  You know what, Ant?  That's a fucking great point.  And what's up with this new M&M song?  It's either one guy or a lot of people fucking trying to turn me on to Rap of God or whatever  the fuck it's called.  It's called Rap God.  Rap God.  Rap God. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, boy.  It's huge.  Why is it a huge song?  Because it's like his first good song in a really long time.  Oh, it's a good one.  I thought fucking Relapse was a great album, and I thought that was after Relapse, it was  Recovery?  Yeah, it was decent.  You liked him doing all the voices?  No, not necessarily.  You did it on every single song.  No, but I liked some of the...  I liked fucking...  He's still going strong.  He's fucking good.  Insane.  My Mom, I liked a lot.  They were some great songs.  Even Berserk was fucking catchy as all hell.  We made fun of it at first, but that damn song, I certainly listened to it a few times. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, I didn't like that one.  In between the gals chatting.  We got beat up for that comment, didn't we?  There was...  I read a tweet from somebody, and it said, you guys are talking about the morning mashup,  saying, what are the girls talking about today?  And he said it was right after you guys talked about oatmeal, fruit, and dogs.  We are the biggest hypocrites.  Can't even fucking argue that point.  That was pretty fucking good.  Nice bash. 
[01:37:30]  That's funny.  So what's this Rap God song about?  It's about him being the man, I guess.  Is it one person that really likes this song, or are people really digging it?  And why are they digging this song?  Because it's good.  They said, lyrically, it's brilliant.  Yeah, I don't even like Eminem anymore, and I think it's good.  Oh, damn.  Happened.  It's a challenging observation, Randall.  Does he talk about God?  Or is he God?  He's the Rap God.  Oh.  Oh, all right.  We'll hear it for him.  You want to hear it a little bit?  Yeah.  What the fudge? 
[01:38:00]  Look, I was going to go easy on you, not to hurt your feelings.  All right.  I'm only going to get...  What's wrong with it?  These beginnings, this whole fucking wackiness in the beginning of a song.  It's the beginning.  It's all about the catchy part, so get to the catchy part.  Exactly.  Get you going.  All right.  It's a six-minute song.  Oh, boy.  Well, we're not going to sit here for six minutes and listen to this.  Okay.  Don't get ornery.  Oh.  Ornery.  Yeah, a bunch of funny duddies. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, gosh.  Let me play this song, Joe.  Whatever.  Jesus.  It's a garbage.  Shut the fuck up.  It's just a feeling I've got.  Like something's about to happen.  That's pretty good.  Anyway.  You didn't give it a chance, Hopester.  Oh, no.  I did.  It's a good song.  Yeah.  I look forward to hearing that one.  Fantastic.  In my travels.  You turned off the song to not say anything. 
[01:39:00]  What?  I want to hear what it sounded like.  I got it.  I'm good.  That was it.  That was it.  That's all we needed.  Yeah, because then I know it's going to be the Eminem thing.  You know that shit.  It'll be good.  It's different.  This one's definitely different.  Is it?  I'll take your word for it.  Yeah.  Pat Cooper's coming in tomorrow.  What?  It's the show that broke the Eminem album on top of shit.  Yeah.  We'd rather talk about the zombies.  Yeah.  You're right.  I know where you were going with that.  Okay.  All right.  I was humming that stupid zombie song.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:39:30]  She's not there on the way in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kenny goes, were you listening to the 60s channel?  I'm like, no.  I was listening to my show yesterday.  Zombies.  And the stupid song got caught in my head.  What's the song again?  She's not there.  Let me tell you about the way you look.  The way she accents the color of a heart.  But no one told me about.  Wow.  It's that airy sound.  See?  Pretty airy.  I'd rather listen to this than you.  Look, the zombies, I like the zombies.  The Eminem song.  We're not really on top of much right now. 
[01:40:00]  Wait, it's about to really get rocking.  All right.  God, this is bad.  It's really bad.  It's too late to say you're sorry.  How would I know?  Why should I care?  What's happening?  Please don't bother trying to find love.  Why are we playing this song two days in a row?  She's not bad.  Well, let me tell you about the way she loved.  The way she accents the color of a heart.  There's new things happening.  It's not so cold.  Our eyes were clear and bright.  It couldn't be less novel. 
[01:40:30]  I like jazz.  I love some jazz.  It's not even the most famous inductee possible into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Did you play some jazz?  No.  Just doing characters and playing the zombies.  I don't understand what's going on anymore.  What?  Zombies rule.  They're not a bad band.  It's all about zombies these days, too.  Okay, I see we're tying in now.  Walking Dead. 
[01:41:00]  We're starting to get topical.  She's not there.  Yeah, there we are.  There we go.  Scientists say Oreos are as addictive as cocaine.  Whoa!  Why?  It's bullshit.  Oreos are probably the food they used.  It's probably sweets with the same dopamine dripping.  Yeah, all right.  I'm guessing that's the food they just used.  What's the real reason there?  I think that's complete bullshit, because that would mean that anybody, not just fat  pigs that fucking, you know, can't control themselves. 
[01:41:30]  I don't know, though.  When Oreos are in my house, though, I can't just have a couple.  You can't just have a couple, but put it this way.  You don't finish the whole bag and then go out and try to find another bag of Oreos with  coke.  And leave your family.  And leave your, yeah, right, right, not worry that you're going to lose your job, your  family, your car, everything, for Oreos.  I've never sucked dicks for Oreos.  Or cocaine, but just for fun.  It's very logical, though. 
[01:42:00]  I understand.  Throw in some logic at this dumb story.  They did the study on rats.  Like, of course a rat is going to go fucking crazy when he eats an Oreo.  Of course.  Imagine eating rat food all your life, and then you get an Oreo.  Right.  But you certainly can move on with your life eventually.  You might eat a shitload.  You can't take a rat and make it, like, eat an Oreo and not fucking love it.  Stop comparing us to rats.  Rats are stupid.  Enough.  Very stupid.  Dumb.  You know what happens when I open up that can of cat food in front of a little beavis? 
[01:42:30]  Meow!  And then I start clawing and crawling up my leg and trying to get to the cat food before  I put it in the little dish for him.  He likes it.  He loves it.  And it tastes like shit.  Oh, it tastes like utter crap.  Hey, it's good enough for the elderly.  It's good enough for beavis.  But he can't get enough of it.  But what?  You're going to compare that to, like, a human?  Oh, well, apparently cat food is this amazing thing like cocaine. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  You've got to go crazy for it because the cat went nuts for it.  Look at him freak out.  Yeah.  Oh.  Come on.  Look at his pupils dilating.  Rats are going to do the same thing for an Oreo.  Of course they are.  Fucking Oreos are amazing.  Basically, the brain responds in the same way as it does for cocaine.  Really?  But, you know, I crave...  I want to say I like this.  It's in the I like this section.  It's awesome shit.  Segment of the brain.  Yeah.  I crave sweets.  And if I just get a couple bites in, I'm good.  So there is a craving thing that happens there.  And it's irrational.  Like, I know... 
[01:43:30]  Like, what I know doesn't override a lot of times.  That fucking...  Eating shitty food is amazing.  I love Oreos.  I haven't had an Oreo in a long time.  No, I actually have one.  I've had, like, one or two when I did red eye, like, a month ago.  I got them in the house right now.  Dude, I can't have them in the house.  I would eat them.  Yes.  People would call me.  What are you doing?  I'd say, I'm eating Oreos.  How about yourself?  I have so many things in my house that just are taboo.  I don't know how you say no.  It's crazy.  You just got to avoid those motherfuckers.  I'm avoiding the Oreo guy. 
[01:44:00]  Ange buys stuff for, like, for guests at the house.  You know, and the kids come over and they want the candy and whatnot.  And then I opened up the fridge the other day, and there's fucking ice cream sandwiches and bonbons.  Fucking bonbons!  You live in a chocolate covered ice cream.  I got to stop you.  Yeah.  You had a lot of really good logic there, but someone is reminding me of a story you told on this very show.  Oh.  You used to steal your fucking neighbor's Oreos. 
[01:44:30]  Not because I was addicted to it, because I was starving!  You broke into his house!  I was hungry.  Oh, no, you live with this guy?  It was a roommate?  I forget the exact story now.  No, he had...  It was a house, but he had a room across the hall from me, and I had another room on the other side.  Didn't you go up on the roof or something and go on his...  No, how did you do this?  I jimmied the lock on his door.  All right, right, right.  Just to get Oreos!  Well, it was anything that would have been in there to eat.  I was starving.  You fucking committed a B&E to eat Oreos?  I was very hungry.  I was very hungry. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, my God.  Poor Anthony had a terrible little life.  Oh, it was...  If anyone thinks Anthony's...  You know, he is a piece of shit for...  Yes.  Anyone that gets mad when Anthony talks about not wanting his shit taken, he had to break  into a place to eat because he was fucking hungry.  Oreos and Triscuits, I would take.  Oh, Triscuits.  Oh.  I had a couple of bad years there.  Yeah.  It was like two solid years of really being, as they say, down on my luck.  You come from absolutely...  Really poor.  It was terrible.  Terrible.  Can we talk about Triscuits for a second?  I hate the Triscuits. 
[01:45:30]  You now hate the Triscuits.  I can't eat a Triscuit because I lived on Triscuits for like a week straight and it was terrible.  Really?  Oh, they were awful dry Triscuits.  It was terrible.  It was awful.  For Halloween, I'd give out handfuls of Triscuits.  I'd just throw them in the bag.  Yeah.  They'd feel crumbled.  I'd have some Triscuits, shit dicks.  Not even the pepper flavored ones?  I don't even know what flavors there are.  These were just regular fucking Triscuits.  Pepper and olive oil.  They're ridiculous. 
[01:46:00]  Right, Iraq?  You're with me on this one.  He knows.  No.  Fuck!  It's garbage.  You don't like a good Triscuit, Iraq?  No.  Triscuits are terrible.  They're not even good with cheese on them.  Like, if you take a good Ritz cracker with some cheddar cheese, some sharp cheddar.  Fuck!  It's because it's buttery, though.  The Ritz cracker is nice and buttery.  I know.  Saltines are better, but I hate.  Saltines are not better than Ritz.  They are so good.  I hate Ritz crackers.  Ritz alone aren't good, but with some cheese on there.  And then the other day, I was taking some very thinly sliced, rare roast beef, and you 
[01:46:30]  put that on the Ritz and a piece of cheese, sharp cheddar on there.  You melt them?  Oh, no, no melting.  Just right there.  Can we send the internet?  It was so fucking good.  What about saltines?  I go old school.  They're better.  You know what?  One lousy saltine with a piece of sharp cheddar.  I don't even need a fancy cracker.  You're right.  Extra sharp cheddar?  I'm a fancy cracker.  I lick each and lick and smell the saltines.  Yes, Iraq, comment.  Ritz cracker with a little piece of pepperoni and some Cracker Barrel cheddar on it. 
[01:47:00]  Who are you kidding, Little?  How involved is this treat?  It's in a small bit of garnet.  Right.  Delivered by a slave.  Not eating wicker furniture.  That's what the fucking wheat thins are.  Wicker furniture.  Gouda cheese.  You give me some gouda on a cracker.  Stoned wheat thins.  My grandmother used to bring them home.  I hate those.  Those were great.  No, those are the ones.  All dry.  Nice gouda cheese.  A little spicy mustard.  Oh, we're throwing the ball around. 
[01:47:30]  We're throwing the ball around a little bit.  Well, we're just talking about what we like.  Fuck Eminem.  See what we did?  Eminem could suck it.  We're doing a topic called your favorite crackers and cheese.  Yes.  During a month where we make fun of other radio shows.  That's right.  Exactly.  But we do it funny.  We never said we were perfect.  We'll end it by saying that we then shove it up our ass.  Absolutely.  See, therein lies the difference.  Brings it home.  The genius.  But I do, all kidding aside, enjoy a good cheese and cracker when I'm in the fucking airport  lounge.  Gosh, it's very hard to say no in that lounge for American Airlines. 
[01:48:00]  God, I love a good cheese and cracker.  Oh, boy.  I'll have two or three and then go, oh, Jim, no more.  You're going to plump up.  Cheese and cracker.  Even though I know it's going to make me flip.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I ate yesterday.  I've never eaten these before.  Fish tacos.  Ew.  You've never had fish tacos?  They're amazing.  I know.  No, no.  He's right.  They do sound disgusting.  They're amazing.  But I had a friend of mine and I ate and she suggested a fish taco and I'm like, okay, why  don't I?  I'll try it.  Then just spread her legs. 
[01:48:30]  Here's my fish taco with extra sour cream.  And I got to be honest, it was fucking amazing.  Fish tacos roll.  What kind of fish?  I don't know.  It was like a fried fish.  But I will say.  I think they use pretty much shitty fish.  Maybe.  In general.  But you could find a good tuna fucking taco for real.  The tuna taco.  They're amazing though.  My farts.  Went down right.  Yeah.  Impressant.  When I tell you my farts were so, I literally almost shit my pants six times on the couch. 
[01:49:00]  Wow.  They were so bad that I wouldn't go and shit.  Wow.  That's bad.  I was like, I can't believe these are my farts.  Wow.  Were you basking in them?  I thought I had food poisoning.  My farts were so bad.  I'm like, enjoy this before you start vomiting.  Because you have food poisoning.  Were they hot?  It was fucking, it was really, it was like sun, it was sun air.  It was air from the sun coming out of my hiney.  Not even, but they weren't even the forceful. 
[01:49:30]  Because if I would have done that, I would have liquid shit.  They were like, like, like those little fucking ones that just kind of eke out incidentally.  Yeah.  Putrid.  Wow.  Why is it the farts that make a noise don't smell as bad as those, like, airy ones?  Because they know that the farts.  Because the loud ones are all fucking, it's like the big guys, they're like the bullies  that get knocked out.  It's like the little ones are the small guys that fucking take boxing that you never see  coming.  Is there a real reason for that, though?  I bet there is a reason.  Because when you feel like your legs get warm from a farts, you know it's going to be horrendous. 
[01:50:00]  It's probably the way it's stacked up in there, waiting to come out, fucking lined up on the  runway.  Anyway, like the fucking big, the loud ones are probably in this small contained area  of very high pressure that goes poof.  But it hasn't spent a lot of time in the area of, like, the smelly part.  And then the gassy ones that take a while are probably spread through the intestine a  little longer. 
[01:50:30]  So it's had more time to pick up some of the...  It comes from the beginning and just goes through everything before it leaves your ass?  It's only a theory, but I believe in it.  I like it.  The loud ones have, it's also an empty air sound.  It's an echo.  Like, it means your shit chamber's empty.  Your shit chamber.  But one of those, when a fucking hot one ekes out...  Oh, there's a torpedo in the tube.  It's almost like, picture yourself like you're wringing out a log with bare hands.  It's like wringing out a dish rag.  That's your body wringing out a log.  You know, every time you fart, it's just collapsing everything, getting the logs ready. 
[01:51:00]  I love a clear fucking hot one.  I still think of that day in D.C. when my fart, when you caught my fart in mid-sentence  and I had a fucking burger on the Metroliner.  It was so bad.  I did those on the plane to Montreal.  How great was that?  It bothered everybody.  My fucking gassers were great.  Are we doing Jocktober before Mike Machete, or are we just blowing it off today? 
[01:51:30]  We gotta do it.  We have plenty of time.  I'd like to do it.  Really fast.  We're talking about food.  I'm a little worried about the Nagel seed.  Oh, no.  What happened?  A little worried about the Nagel seed, Eric.  The precious Prince Nagel seed.  That's right.  We love talking about Nagel.  Yes.  Nagel seed.  He used to take it home with him.  Oh, man.  He used to shoot his love into a condom and then take the condom and bring it home with  him so the girl couldn't take it and squeeze it into her.  Are you talking about Prince Nagel's golden sperm? 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  Eating bacon lowers sperm quality.  Oh, no, Eric.  Eric.  Not the golden seed.  I like bacon, but I'm not really eating it.  Not a lot?  No.  All right, because it can lower your fucking sperm quality.  Oh, man.  Really?  You know what that means, too, right?  Huh?  There's a pig joke there somewhere.  Come on.  I stopped for something.  No, I know.  When you said, I'm not really eating it, I was going to say it's because you're made 
[01:52:30]  of it, but I decided not to say it.  Very big of you.  Mean to me.  Oh, we're being good boys these days.  Al Sharpen is 138 pounds.  Someone just tweeted me on the Wendy Williams show.  That's crazy.  That's what he did.  I can't.  I got to say the fucking son of a bitch looks good.  But, like, he doesn't look good.  How are you crazy?  138 pounds doesn't look good on that body.  He has a big head.  But, I mean, he lost all that weight.  He did lose a lot.  Yeah, because he fucking got...  Did he get the surgery?  Yeah, I mean, I don't fault anyone that does that.  Sorry. 
[01:53:00]  I saw Hard Rock Johnny at the Metallica show.  He looked amazing.  I couldn't believe it was the same fucking guy.  I know we're going way inside here, but he's one of our friends.  Yeah.  We've been with him a long fucking time.  I didn't recognize him, dude.  He came up to me, and I'm like, I just assumed it was, you know, a fan or whatever.  And I'm like, Johnny?  What the fuck?  I know.  He looks amazing.  I did not recognize him.  You didn't either, right?  He's off the apnea machine now, because Johnny was a good supporter.  Him and Eddie Trunk were really helping me and encouraging me.  And both of those guys, I think, have lost so much weight, they don't even need those  machines anymore.  Wow.  It was amazing.  Good for him, man. 
[01:53:30]  I had a thrilling day yesterday, by the way.  Thrilling.  What'd you do?  As I was fucking walking from Best Buy looking for this thing, and I bumped into Robert Klein.  Oh.  And I was just going to look at him like a fan, and he said hello to me.  He goes, oh, hey, man.  Whoa.  And he goes, yeah, I haven't heard the Opie and Anthony show, but my friend, my trainer  is obsessed with it, and he says that you say nice things about me.  So Robert Klein's trainer got me a nice conversation with fucking Robert Klein.  You love Robert Klein.  Yes, I do.  I mean, nice.  Where'd you get him on?  I was thrilled going walking home. 
[01:54:00]  I was thrilled that he recognized me and chatted.  Yeah, we should get him on.  I love him.  I went home and watched Robert Klein at Yale.  You did?  Yes.  Nice.  How you did?  Yeah.  Let's get him on, then, man.  That'd be kind of cool.  Want me to talk to Roland?  What happened?  Yes.  Roland, I hope you're listening back there.  We're going to try to get Robert Klein on. 
[01:54:30]  Roland.  Huh?  Comment.  Roland.  Rolly.  Hey, you're ready, you're ready.  So thank you to the trainer, however you may be.  Pretty nice.  Probably really hates us.  Recognized by a big comedian.  That's pretty close.  Oh, was I happy.  I got recognized by a hot dog vendor.  That's the same thing, right?  Oh, yeah?  That's pretty good.  I love that.  Hey, we got Mike Francesco out of here. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, I saw, what's her name?  And that fucking cute blonde girl from the scary movie movies.  Anna Faris.  Anna Faris was in the other day.  Here?  Yeah.  I saw her out by the back.  She was actually stopping.  We had her out once.  Yeah, she was stopped, and she was talking with fans and signing stuff and taking pictures  out by the back door for kind of a little while, you know?  They didn't whisk her right in.  And I went out, and I was just looking, and I was like, what did she do to her face?  She destroyed it.  She did some kind of lip thing. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  And face thing, I don't know what.  She looks like a stripper now.  Whoa.  No.  She was trying to, like, do...  You can't even tell from those films.  No, that looks like a better...  It's when you see her in a movie where they film outside, that's when it's really bad.  Yeah, I saw her outside.  That's the problem.  And it was...  That face shit is made for, you know...  Such a cute girl.  And doors.  And then she mucked it all up with some...  Mucking up the works.  Some surgery or some shit.  Yeah, it's too bad. 
[01:56:00]  The man.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, she's kind of looking strippy.  She wanted to look sexier.  Because she had some kind of a cute, wholesome thing going for herself there.  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  She seemed nice enough, though.  I like cute and wholesome.  It's not me all this year.  Oh, God.  What the hell are you doing?  It's not me.  But why are you showing us that?  Oh, oh, oh.  No.  Not...  But obviously, it's not me.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, I get it.  I got what you were doing.  Really?  Oh, my goodness.  But not me.  No.  Get the fuck out of here.  Was he?  No.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  But, you know, she told me.  She gave me.  We're just talking in private.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I just thought of it.  Holy shit.  Yeah, I figured I'd share.  What the fuck is he doing?  What's he doing?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:57:00]  Not.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not him.  No, no, no.  Oh.  Oh, God.  No, no, no.  It's not him, and it's not you?  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no, no.  Yo, no.  Sent me that.  Uh-huh.  Sorry, guys.  To the listeners.  I got it.  No, I know, but it's...  Some nobody.  What?  What?  Nobody.  It's nobody of note, honestly.  Just a regular person.  Oh, you just did that reference for...  Okay.  I just...  Okay, I got it.  I realized I was going to show you.  I said, I forgot.  That's pretty cool.  I just remembered.  Yeah.  So before I forgot again, because my memory is going. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, I know.  I think they love when we do inside radio.  Yeah, I apologize to the listeners.  That was stupid.  You just said, you know.  No, I said, I know that.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  We just keep going with it.  Yeah, we do.  What happened?  I apologized to the listeners.  I said, I'm sorry.  I should have done it.  Fuck them.  I just forgot.  Like, I wouldn't...  It happens.  Mike Francesa had this to say.  We love Mike Francesa's audio, and we love that you guys are keeping track and sending  in the clips from time to time, because he's a lot of fun to listen to.  Oh, yeah.  A game after, you know, this idea, we waited all day. 
[01:58:00]  Well, that's the stupidest song that ever was created.  No one...  I guess I got to explain.  Yeah, what is that?  The Monday Night Football song?  Yes.  He's talking about the Monday Night Football song.  He doesn't like it?  He's bothered by that.  Oh.  A game after, you know, this idea, we waited all day.  Well, that's the stupidest song that ever was created.  No one waits all day.  They watch football all day.  Wait, I waited all day for Sunday night.  No one waited one minute for Sunday night.  They watch football all darn day.  The dumbest...  I haven't thought of that. 
[01:58:30]  I always say it's the most dumb...  It's the dumbest thing I ever heard in the lyrics.  I waited all day for Sunday night.  No one ever waited one minute for Sunday night.  They watch football all day on Sunday night.  All right.  Getting ready for Sunday night.  That's the dumbest song ever created.  Sorry.  I love it.  Was that...  I love that.  That's great.  Because he's right.  He's right.  But if you're a football fan, you're watching all fucking day, the Red Zone, your team,  fantasy football.  No one's waiting.  No one waits for a Sunday night football game.  It just segs into it.  You pretty much are watching games leading up to it. 
[01:59:00]  Did he have to say it that many times exactly the same way?  I like that one.  I kind of like that one.  He's right.  He's the stupidest lyric ever.  Because I never realized how stupid that lyric was.  What's up with this touchdown?  Uh-oh.  A little cancer kid takes the field and they let him score a little touchdown.  That guy should have fucking tackled that.  Look at him.  Right there.  They're letting him run.  Oh, look at the blockers.  They're blocking.  Come on.  Come on.  That guy could nail him right there.  Yeah.  Oh, that's adorable. 
[01:59:30]  Trip him.  What the hell?  And there's the little fella.  Oh, my goodness.  The little guy.  A little brain surgery.  Oh, look.  He's all cute.  Poor kid.  There is no God, by the way.  Well.  There is no God.  He works in mysterious ways.  Why would there be a God that would just be like, yeah, we'll take this little kid.  And he could just cut his fucking skull open.  It was God who gave everyone the idea to let him run for a touchdown.  Oh, is that it?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, that's good.  All right. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, that's good.  Are we going to do Jacktober?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay.  Savage beating being thrown.  That's great.  Okay.  That's good.  What's this about?  When he called for help rather than intervene.  The choice he had under school policy.  That's a beating going on.  And we reached out to the school district, and they told us that they're reviewing the  actions of staff members aware of the incident to determine if district procedures were followed.  Pamela Brown creeps me out. 
[02:00:30]  All right, Pam.  Yeah, because she's beautiful, but her eyes don't focus on anything.  She's got, like, lifeless eyes.  She does, right?  Yes.  We should take a quick break, and then we're going to do some Jacktober next.  We've got Mike Buschetti coming in, a very funny guy.  I find him a bit strange.  Yeah.  Jimmy has known him for a long time.  Worse with Artie Lang.  Looking forward to talking to him today.  I have to mention something, too.  Yeah, sure.  Tomorrow and Saturday, if you're in Lancaster, I will be there at Stitches Comedy Club doing 
[02:01:00]  the new material.  It's cheaper tickets, and it went really well last week.  And then next Friday, Saturday, October 25th, 26th, I'm up in Rochester doing the Comedy  Club.  And then November 1st, I'm with Dice at the Beacon, and November 15th, 16th, the Comedy  Works in Albany.  Ooh.  Yeah, I'm going up there.  Well, go see Jimmy.  Of course.  If you want to or don't.  Oh, go.  Happy birthday, Norm MacDonald. 
[02:01:30]  It's one of our favorite clips.  Norm.  Norm MacDonald is 50 years old today.  Wow, the big, what is it, 5-0.  Not bad, not bad. 
[02:02:00]  Norm.  Let's do this over here.  It's Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  O-M-G.  Host.  Host.  Bits.  And Stunt Boys.  This isn't mine. 
[02:02:30]  It's time for...  Jocktober.  I want to see the Bolt movie.  Bolt movie.  Bolt movie.  Bolt movie.  Wake up, Boston.  We're coming your way today.  Again in Boston.  Boston.  Boston.  I wasn't here for the other Boston one.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Huh?  That was Baltazar.  No, we're not.  Hello, Boston.  This looks terrible.  We're going straight to Boston's best variety.  Wow.  Why does it look terrible? 
[02:03:00]  He's got a tat.  He's got almost a sleeve.  I call that almost a sleeve.  He's the crazy guy.  Then we got the regular guy there.  He's, you know, and we got a hole.  How many Boston morning shows are just listening like, oh, they might be talking about us.  They could be us.  They could be talking about us.  I'm the crazy guy.  We got this.  We got the hole.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Batting down the hatches.  Ah, fucking A.  Fucking Cossacka.  Up in A.  How did they used to say her name?  They used to say it in a weird way. 
[02:03:30]  Um, uh, uh, uh, whatever.  Ha, ha, ha.  We're going to Mix 104.1.  Yes.  Boston's Best Variety with Carson and Kennedy.  Oh, yes.  Oh, boy.  Which one's the Carson dude?  Carson is in the middle there.  Which one's Kennedy?  Kennedy is the lovely young lady.  Well, because Kennedy could be either a boy or a girl.  Kennedy is a girl in this case.  Okay.  And, uh.  And what's his name?  The crazy guy with the tats.  The guy with the tats.  He's kind of looking at the camera like, hey, what are you looking at? 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  That's Salt.  What?  What are you talking about?  Like the condiment?  S-A-L-T is his name.  Salt.  This is where I have to tell the people that Opie's not a radio name.  Ah.  I got stuck with his fucking name when I was 12 years old.  Oh, oh, good bio.  Nice.  I love a good bio.  What's going on with their bios?  Oh, wow.  Look at the face.  A little crazy.  I'm fog.  A little crazy.  Well, we'll go to Carson.  Let's find a little bit out about Carson first. 
[02:04:30]  I feel like I know this guy from somewhere.  I didn't work with him.  Glory hole.  Thanks.  Carson with a K.  Carson with a K, mind you.  Which, by the way, I'm sure his name is spelled with a C.  But he teamed up with a girl named Kennedy.  So they were like, oh, Carson and Kennedy.  His name probably isn't even Carson.  John.  Yeah.  Anything in the bio?  Well, he's one of those guys that married up.  Way up.  Oh.  What does that mean?  I guess he has a hot wife.  All right. 
[02:05:00]  That's good.  That's always good.  Talk up your wife in your bio.  Twin daughters from my first marriage.  Uh-oh.  He's a problem.  10 in college.  Mm-hmm.  I don't mind a bio that just gives information.  Oh, they're trying to be funny.  I don't like when they try to be funny.  Why don't we get right into it?  If you see anything in the bio worth mentioning, you're fucking mentioning it.  We'll mention it.  Salt.  It's all about salt.  Marital status.  Always single.  All right. 
[02:05:30]  Watch out.  I bet he has a man cave.  But no, but not only is he like a dude, but he's a little funny, too.  Interest.  Rollerblading fondue parties, making mixtapes and puppies.  Come on.  That's not the salt we know.  Oh, look how he does his weight.  Look at the hair.  What?  Salt and pepper.  Irony noted.  Oh.  His name's salt.  Look at his weight.  He does it in stones. 
[02:06:00]  16 stones or 225 pounds.  Oh, God.  Oh, this guy.  This guy.  I bet Kennedy's got to keep tabs on him.  Oh, yeah.  Constantly.  Christ.  I think All Access did an article on how talk radio is completely dying.  Yeah.  And they're to blame because no one's doing anything new.  No.  Oh.  You want to talk about that article?  You want to talk about doing nothing new?  Yeah.  I think I found the show for you.  Is it all shit we've heard before? 
[02:06:30]  Dude.  Like, you know how you guys get frustrated with Jocktober?  Uh-huh.  Like, I finally hit the point listening to this show yesterday.  Like, I can't believe I'm pursuing this business.  Just another show that is the arm of the not-creative PD that gives them ideas.  Anyone else noticing we're in the PD outstage of the bit?  Yeah, of course.  It happens every year.  Yeah.  The excitement was so over the top leading up to October 1st. 
[02:07:00]  Are we going to be just mad today, or will there be some jokes in here, hopefully?  I have confidence that you'll be able to-  Will there be opportunities for us?  Oh, yeah.  All right, good.  And, uh, well, Carson's wife calls in.  She's the hot one, right?  Oh, yeah.  Because he married up or something?  Way up?  Way up.  So he's got a hot wife.  Well, the hot wife calls in to talk about the outrageous stuff he did while she was on  vacation.  Uh-huh.  Man of the house.  While the cat's away, the mice will play.  Wait, she went on a separate vacation? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, I guess with their kid or whatever.  I don't know what's up, dude.  Oh, and so while she's, like, away, I got it.  Oh, yeah.  This is crazy shit.  My wife is asked to come on the show this morning, Kennedy.  Yes.  She is standing by.  She put together a short list of all the stuff that I screwed up while her and Barrett were  out of town for three weeks.  All right.  Good morning, babe.  Hi, good morning.  Hey, girl.  How are you?  I hate the wife calling the fucking show, bitch.  Wife's on the radio.  I fucking hate it. 
[02:08:00]  Well, why don't we give it a chance?  It may be good.  No need to prejudge it.  Hey.  Oh, jeez.  If you go to their Facebook page, there's a picture of a house with some kind of white  liquid on top of it.  And then there's a picture of Bobo.  And he's holding a sign that says, I got a pre on my house.  Here comes the pre.  Yeah.  And there's a schnoodle in the front yard.  Of course.  A schnoodle.  I got a pre on my house. 
[02:08:30]  There's a picture.  What's his name?  What do you mean, what's his name?  No, college.  Jim Chandler.  Right.  Jim Chandler.  My friend.  And the caption says, my best friend in college betrayed me.  Sad face.  Why is this all on their Facebook page?  We're almost friends again.  Crazy.  But why do they...  Oh, no.  Oh, and what's Craig Schenkel posting?  Oh, no.  It's October.  How's it taste, motherfucker? 
[02:09:00]  I don't know what...  They have weird fans, man.  We didn't even give out the Facebook page.  This is so strange.  We never...  There's a picture of Jim when he was overweight wearing a small, very small women's t-shirt.  That has a picture of George Bush on it that says, small penis, big lord.  Oh, man.  You would fit in that shirt now.  I would look good.  Craig Schenkel.  How old is it?  My name.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  There's a picture of a turkey foot.  Wild turkey foot. 
[02:09:30]  Dennis Falcone army is here.  We're here to fuck you up.  That would explain it.  Dennis Falcone's army is his.  So Dennis is secretly giving out the Facebook page to everybody, I guess?  Little Beavis.  I guess so.  Yeah.  This is weird.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, I'd like to hear a little of this.  Okay.  Let's give it a chance.  The hot wife, she's gone for three weeks, and this Carson guy, because he's a bit crazy,  did some crazy shit.  Well, Carson's not crazy.  It's a...  No, Carson's a little crazy, because his wife's out of town. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, okay.  Carson's doing the outrageous stuff, because he's single for a few weeks, right?  Oh, look out.  I hope she didn't give him a whole pass.  Oh, look out.  Look out.  All right.  Good morning, babe.  Hi.  Good morning.  Hey, girl.  How are you?  Hi.  How was your vacation?  Oh, good.  How would he not know?  Huh?  Why would he not...  He talked to her?  It's because these radio assholes don't know how to just be regular people.  How was your vacation, hon?  As soon as you turn the mic on, you forget how to talk normally. 
[02:10:30]  He asked her how her vacation was when she got home.  Of course.  Yeah, you know that he's seen her.  Until he was on the air to ask her.  Right, right.  Don't talk about it, honey.  Don't tell me about your vacation.  Save it for the air.  How was your vacation?  Oh, oh, actually, actually, save it for the air.  Save it for the air.  Hi.  How was your vacation?  Oh, it was good.  We had an awesome time.  And I hate to keep stopping it, but...  Awesome time.  But then the other people, shouldn't they jump in and go, what do you mean, how was her vacation?  Yeah, yeah.  You live with her. 
[02:11:00]  Like, why can't they have a real moment?  She should ask her last night.  Right.  You're wasting our air time for her.  I'd love to hear some...  Did you come home?  ...black gentleman in the background.  Some sexual suggestions.  She's wondering who it is.  Who's that there, honey?  Yo, who are you talking to?  So you're watching BET, no one.  Oh, my God, that's just not right.  That's just not right. 
[02:11:30]  Just weirdness going on in their Facebook page.  I don't understand that at all.  It's crazy.  Scott Shannon as Stonehenge?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  You've got to acknowledge that one every time.  Can I see it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, bravo.  Bravo.  I didn't see that one.  Wow, why would they allow this on their fucking Facebook page?  I don't know.  They must have had some kind of weird promotion.  Look.  It's a big rock head.  Yeah, that is.  Oh, it's good.  We have an awesome time.  Did you come home to a house that was left similar to the way you left it when you went 
[02:12:00]  on vacation prior?  Um, yeah.  Actually, Carson had the house clean.  Oh, that's nice.  So it wasn't stuff at the house, like, that was bad.  It was...  Oh, I got to apologize.  So he's not talking to his own wife at this point.  It's the other dude, I think.  Yeah.  No, he's talking to his own wife.  Is he?  Why is he referring to himself in the third person?  He said Carson had...  Well, it's probably Saltz.  No, Saltz jumped in. 
[02:12:30]  Jumped in.  They all sound alike.  Well, yeah.  Saltz, look, there's a little crazy in Saltz's voice.  Because she said she had...  He had the apartment cleaned, and there was a throw rug that's missing, and the police  were there with luminal.  Carson had the house cleaned.  Oh, that's nice.  So it wasn't stuff at the house, like, that was bad.  It was other stuff?  Oh, no, no.  It was just other stuff.  The...  Our bedspread, our comforter...  Oh, my God.  ...destroyed.  See? 
[02:13:00]  Destroyed.  Is he an angry sleeper?  No, I...  The dog peed on the bed one night.  He sleeps with us.  And so I did what I thought was the right thing, and I put it in the...  Took it to the dry cleaner?  No.  No, no, no.  Put it in our home washing machine.  Oh, yeah.  Home washing machine.  Brilliant.  Yeah.  So it burned a hole in the comforter where it tried to spin, I guess, and it didn't spin.  Yeah, you better be glad that it didn't burn up our brand new washing machine.  That would have been another one to add to the list.  This is fascinating radio. 
[02:13:30]  But he's blaming it on the dog?  Yeah, yeah.  The dog peed.  In other words, he got a squirter come over the house.  Right.  She fucking vag-blasted him all over the comforter.  What am I going to do?  It's the hooker story we do.  I'm going to lose my wife.  I'm going to lose my wife.  I can't.  She's spraying like a fucking sprinkler. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Like a golf course sprinkler.  Yes.  Oh.  With the fingers in the fucking box.  In the box.  You ever see a squirter when they put like four fingers in?  Oh.  They go.  And then they pull it out real fast and go.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I was watching some squirting videos recently.  I'm not even turned on by it.  It's just an amazing fucking thing to watch.  Do you ever have it done on you?  That's kind of sexy.  No.  It feels warm.  I've had it in my mouth a few times. 
[02:14:30]  It's not growing.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  It's like a girl coming.  It's fucking hot.  But it wasn't a girl and it was coming out of a penis.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucking all right, Tim Technical.  I have a quick update.  Yes.  If you don't mind.  Sure.  Phase one complete.  Whoa.  What does that mean again?  Phase one.  Basically what it means is something happens to these shows' Facebook pages.  Ah.  And they, Mix 104.1 has closed the public wall.  Oh.  On their Facebook page.  Yet, you can still comment on their posts. 
[02:15:00]  Ironically enough.  On their posts.  The previous posts that are already up there.  Which people are doing.  Of course they are.  They're saying supportive things.  Yeah, they should.  They really should have.  One is a picture of feces that's drawn to look like a snake and it says King Poopra.  It doesn't even make any sense whatsoever.  Those are the best ones, though.  King Poopra.  See?  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  It's poop.  Yes, it is.  It's Jacktober. 
[02:15:30]  Boston's Best Variety Mix 104.1 is being featured at the Carson and Kennedy Show.  And a caller with the last name of Connors calls in.  Oh.  Want to guess what they did with that?  Sarah or Jimmy?  Connors or Conner?  Connors.  Connors.  Well, I would think they probably did a Sarah Connor joke.  Yeah.  Okay.  And we just love that your last name is Connors, by the way. 
[02:16:00]  I know.  It's like the Terminator.  I know.  We're childish, but we giggle every day.  It's not.  Connors.  That's all right.  I get it every day.  Do you really?  Come with me if you want to.  It's original.  Right.  Can you do a good...  Everyone thinks they're the first person.  I know.  Oh, yeah.  And they think they're funnier than the one who came before them.  Right.  Names are the best.  Right.  Sarah Connor.  Sarah Connor.  It's still so silly.  But it's Sarah Connor.  It's not Connors.  Oh, that's just a technicality.  But that's like the name. 
[02:16:30]  No, it's just a technicality.  Oh, God.  Just some antics.  Come on.  Anime Sam getting fucked in the ass.  Quick little update.  It's not an anime.  Actually, there's weird stuff going on on the show's Facebook page.  I was looking at the station Facebook page.  And there's just weird things being posted on the wall.  Oh, wow.  On their Facebook page.  A lot of gay references.  There's more interracial. 
[02:17:00]  There's a Dennis Falcone poster.  Yes.  Jockstrap shoved into an asshole.  It does look like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just weird stuff going on.  Oh, this one.  It's Sarah Connor.  Not Connors.  You fucking piece of shit.  I guess this fan was listening to the same break as us.  Must have been.  Yeah.  Must have been.  Well, really quick on that one.  Animals wouldn't say that. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, boy.  I didn't know that's an accurate caption of that.  Those are very racist things.  There's a picture of the Jonas Brothers.  Oh.  Yeah.  One of their fans has captioned it AIDS with tons of eyes.  Oh, see?  That's not nice at all.  Guys, good news.  Salt from the Carson and Kennedy show.  All right.  He's going to step it up.  Goes out on the street to offer Freedom Trail tours while the government is shut down. 
[02:18:00]  All right.  His own version, I hope.  And Salt was a little sad to hear the news about so many things being shut down in Boston yesterday.  I was.  Boston is such a great city and such a great city for history and tourism.  And Faneuil Hall.  We invented America.  I know.  It's got so many great things that you can do out there.  And it was a beautiful day yesterday.  Gorgeous.  So I felt bad for all these out-of-towners that were down there and they couldn't go on the Freedom Trail.  I mean, they could go on it, but they weren't going to get the guided tour because it's technically a national park. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  So I offered up my services as a scab tour guide.  Now, have you heard about the Freedom Trail before?  Yes.  Do you want to do it with me?  I've lived in Boston for over a year and a half now.  I think I could give a great tour.  Absolutely.  Quick question, though, before we get started on this.  Where does the Freedom Trail start?  I have no idea.  S***.  Neither do I.  So the Freedom Trail, completely shut down for you today.  Just a little fun.  Just a little fun.  Very.  Why would he say the N-word there? 
[02:19:00]  Why would he call that lady that, right?  That's terrible.  That's tasteless.  So the Freedom Trail, completely shut down for you today.  Well, no.  We're being self-guided instead of tour-guided.  Would you like me to take you on the tour?  No, that's okay.  We're doing it.  You don't think I know what the Freedom Trail is?  No, I think you're fine.  Yeah, you're good.  No, the Freedom Trail.  That was the one based in the movie with Mel Gibson with the blue face where he yelled freedom at the end, right?  I don't think so.  Are you sure?  I'm sure.  Not the same Freedom Trail. 
[02:19:30]  Would you like to take that tour, though?  That would be a good tour.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Pluralized.  He just kept saying it.  That would be a good tour.  You know, we're a bunch of idiots.  This is where BCN used to be, right?  104.1?  Oh, is it?  Maybe.  Holy fuck.  Oh, my God.  This is what they did with that fucking legendary place?  I didn't even realize.  Right?  Some good stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, BCN was 104.1. 
[02:20:00]  Wow.  Which we obviously worked for for a while there.  And Toucher and Rich Robinson.  Oh, my God.  They moved them to Sports Talk, and this is the horse shit they replaced BCN with?  That's it.  Regular radio is just utter fucking garbage.  I hear phase two has been achieved.  Yeah, phase one is complete on the Carson and Kennedy Facebook page as well.  I want to say sorry to Oedipus.  I feel bad for it.  Oh, my goodness.  He has to fucking live with this shit. 
[02:20:30]  Is he still consulting or no?  I doubt it.  Why would he?  He had to see BCN go away, and they replaced it with Mix 104.1.  And this drivel.  Austin's best variety.  At least it does have a little more variety than BCN did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd like to hear more.  More like it.  Have some laughs.  Good stuff.  Well, more of salt.  He's out there.  All right.  Trying to give tours.  Would you guys be interested in taking one of those if I was your guided tour? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, let's do it.  First question, though.  Where does it start?  It doesn't start right here.  I don't know where it starts.  Well, you're the tour guide.  Yeah.  I fucking hate when people play along with the bit.  That's when I always moved on.  You are the tour guide.  Oh, yeah.  Let's do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You say you know.  That's when I always move on and try to find somebody else.  Of course.  The people that play along.  There's a lot of comments on their photos. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  No, no.  It'll be a fun tour.  I didn't say it'll be factual.  Our daughter actually lives in D.C.  In fact, she's a lobbyist there.  And she called us last night and said, you're going to be bummed.  Your non-essential daughter?  No.  No, she's very central.  She works for a private organization.  So she's not with the government.  She's against the government.  Well, no.  She's actually for the government.  Well, if you're not with him, you're against him, right?  You're a jerk.  You're a jerk.  You're such an ambassador to the city. 
[02:22:00]  I really am.  That's Salt taking it out on the streets.  You would come back with that, right?  And go, so what did you get out there?  No, I didn't get anything.  Nah, it just didn't.  Nothing was happening.  Now that.  Just because you hear voices doesn't mean you put it on the radio.  Just because someone stopped and spoke to you doesn't mean you should put it on the air.  You're giving Salt a lot of credit.  Oh, yeah?  You're assuming that he actually did go to the locations that he claimed he was at.  Oh, that's true.  And he didn't just go and talk to his sales guy.  I bet he did, though.  I bet he went out there. 
[02:22:30]  No, I bet he went out there.  Oh, he's a wild guy.  That audio is awful enough to be believed in me.  Yeah, he tried to mix it up with some of the people.  This is so weird.  You do learn things.  There's a photo of the Jonas Brothers.  Yeah.  And then one of the comments is, Dennis Falcone has a huge cock.  Oh, wow.  Why would that?  You just, I don't know.  There's a lot of chip comments.  Yeah.  Well, you want to, let's just, let's just stop.  I want to hear some more.  Why do you want to stop?  Because I don't want to hear the wicked wake up. 
[02:23:00]  Why not?  I want to hear wicked wake up.  Part of October is hearing the marquee bits.  Ah.  Time for a wicked wake up.  Right.  Which is what?  Well, you say wicked a lot if you're not from the area.  So people think you're from the area.  Right.  So you tag everything with the word wicked, and then you hope the fucking locals will  embrace you.  Weird comment from Craig Shingle.  Because Bostonians don't embrace you right away.  I remember that, too.  It took some time.  But when they finally embrace you, they don't fucking let go, obviously.  Leave us alone! 
[02:23:30]  What a question.  I didn't say that.  It's not me.  It's not me.  Craig Shingle commented on this photo of the Jonas Brothers.  It just says, Opie hates Jim Chandler.  I don't hate Jim Chandler.  Oh.  That's not me that's a made-up prank shit call.  It's not me.  The Wicked Wake Up is about to happen, and it should be noted once again that prank calls  are illegal on regular radio especially.  Uh-huh.  I believe here as well, at this point, satellite radio.  So what you're about to hear is a fake fucking phone call. 
[02:24:00]  Wouldn't it be great if he did something original, though, like the way he woke his wife up?  Was he putting M-80 in her panties?  Yeah.  That was just mean and not funny.  Long-winded.  Hi.  Can I speak with Albert?  Yeah, speaking.  This is Howard Treaty.  I am with Howard's Haunting Halloween Headliners.  We supply Halloween headliners for local corn mazes and local haunted houses.  We're having an issue with one of our performers, and he's claiming that you assaulted him the 
[02:24:30]  Tuesday before last at a haunted house in Abington.  That's ridiculous.  Okay.  Albert, there's nothing ridiculous about this.  Were you intoxicated when you went to said haunted house?  I might have had a couple of beers, but I hardly think that that deems me to be intoxicated.  They all sound the same with their acting.  The bad acting, the cuts.  Right.  Oh, God.  Beers, but I hardly think that that deems me to be intoxicated. 
[02:25:00]  Okay, so you would say that you probably shouldn't punch somebody right in the face when they  jump out at you, would you, Albert?  No, yeah, of course you shouldn't.  Because you know it's going to happen.  Well, you don't know when it's going to happen.  Yeah, so when chainsaw killer number three comes out at you, why did you punch him square  in the noggin?  I did not know.  Okay, all right.  I know who you're talking about.  I didn't punch anyone in the face.  There were two other chainsaw guys there ahead of him.  You knew it was coming, son. 
[02:25:30]  Okay, listen, this guy, he came at me and he got a little bit too much in my area and  I pushed back.  Oh.  Christ.  I pushed back.  He grabbed my hips.  We're in the mad stage.  I know, now we're just angry.  I got some news that just came in on Twitter.  We would have to verify it, but I believe it.  In 2009, we jock-tobered this very show.  Wow, really?  Did you hear me in the beginning? 
[02:26:00]  I said this sound familiar.  I feel like I know the guy.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So they're very familiar with what's going on.  But they haven't improved.  What show were they on then?  I think it was the same show.  I feel like they came from Rochester.  Good big time.  Rochester.  I believe.  But they haven't improved whatsoever.  No.  No.  Because we don't know.  The great thing about jock-tobered, we forget about the fucking show the next day.  A hundred percent.  Very forgettable.  Except for my poor pal, Jim Chandler.  I hate him. 
[02:26:30]  He seems to be a good guy.  That was jock-tobered's finest moment.  We're almost there.  We're almost back to being friends.  And I pushed back.  Oh.  I placed my hands on him.  It was more of a, hey, you stay away from me.  And then I...  Oh.  I see what you're doing.  You're trying to act tough for your lady there, huh?  Oh, look at me.  I can push a poor defenseless Halloween performer.  Oh, I'm the big man. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'll protect you from a guy with a chainsaw with no chain in it.  Listen, I, you know, I would if someone was coming out.  Well, you did.  I certainly would protect her.  You did.  But he surprised me.  He came out from behind the coffin.  Yeah.  And I didn't, so I just kind of, hey, man, back off.  Wow.  That's fucking realistic.  He's really got him going, huh, Chip?  He's got this guy going good.  Oh, you like it, Chip?  Fuck yeah.  This guy's going.  He's going?  Yeah, he's got him. 
[02:27:30]  He's in a lot of trouble, right?  Oh, God, he's pooping bricks.  Whoa, Chipper.  Just stop fucking doing the fake.  Just knock it off.  Just stop doing them.  Find something else to do with that 10 minutes with your show.  Yeah.  Right?  I don't know why.  I feel like I have to give advice to these people.  They don't take it, obviously.  He doesn't take them.  Because the industry is collapsing.  He's trying to have fun with it.  It's like, it's annoying.  It's like, look, it doesn't work anymore.  You're not allowed to do it.  So fucking figure out something else to do with that time.  It's annoying.  How hard is that?  Because it's not one show doing this. 
[02:28:00]  No.  It's the industry collapsing.  The acting in this is so uncomfortable.  And they farm these actors out to radio show after radio show across this great country  of ours.  Yeah, he pushed them back, though.  This guy doesn't know what's going on.  Chip doesn't understand that it's fake.  They're not following our conversation.  You want to push it back on?  I want to hear what happened.  Well, it's the big reveal is what's going to happen here.  Wait until this guy finds out he's on the radio.  Oh, it's going to be great.  It's going to shit a bunch of bricks. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, you didn't you didn't realize he was going to come out from behind a coffin?  Come on.  No, I mean, no.  I mean, I saw a shameful guy from behind a coffin.  That doesn't make any sense.  It doesn't.  That's not.  It's a coffin in a room.  There's either one or two things.  He's either going to pop out from inside the coffin or from behind the coffin.  But I just sort of assumed that the coffin was going to be a distraction so that he would  come from somewhere else.  So then why do you push the guy?  Huh?  Why do you push him and punch him in the nose?  I didn't punch him in the nose.  I gently placed my hands on him and then I backed off. 
[02:29:00]  This is Carson from the Chimple Shop.  The big reveal.  And I would be happy to apologize.  Chainsaw Maniac number three does not want your money.  He does not want your apology.  He is now scared to work in haunted houses anymore because of people, brutes, I say,  like you, that go after these poor defenseless Halloween performers whose only job is to  go in there and scare you.  And now you go in there assaulting people like this, the man will probably never work 
[02:29:30]  in the industry again.  He literally has a chainsaw.  So I don't think we can call him defenseless.  That's right.  Touche.  Albert, how are you doing this morning?  My name's Salt.  I'm with Mix 104.  We're one with Carson.  Oh, yeah.  You like his little laugh there.  Fuck yeah.  It's like, uh, I'm Salt.  Who makes that?  Oh, but he's got to chuckle and like, I gotcha.  I gotcha.  He did.  Chippa loves it.  Fuck yeah.  Phone scam.  Oh.  No, it's not over yet. 
[02:30:00]  It's not over yet.  Oh, big stop.  The music.  Stop.  That's the Jacktober close music.  You can't play it.  And I want to...  It's also a phone scam.  No, I want to...  You don't hear the guy yet.  That was tricked.  Oh, boy.  I bet he's speechless.  I'm here at Salt.  Touche.  Albert, how are you doing this morning?  My name's Salt.  I'm with Mix 104.  One with Carson and Kennedy.  You're on a wicked wake-up call.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Okay.  Your girlfriend told us that you pushed a guy when you guys were in the haunted house. 
[02:30:30]  Carson and Kennedy on Mix 104.  Of course.  Of course.  Because they even realized the acting was so bad, we could use maybe the laugh.  Wow.  It was that bad.  He got him.  You pushed a guy when you guys were in the haunted house.  Carson and Kennedy on Mix 104.  Carson and Kennedy.  Oh, we're not done yet. 
[02:31:00]  I'm sorry, Boston.  That music gets me going.  Sorry.  I love a good crank call.  Fucking guy already got him good.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't know what to do.  Well, time for a parody song.  The staple of the morning show.  Yeah.  I love a good parody.  What are the elements of a good parody song?  You got to do something that's a...  Topical.  Topical.  Is that an answer, Sam Roberts?  Topical subject.  Topical subject. 
[02:31:30]  Fuck, yeah.  And pick...  Very recognizable song.  Pick a popular song.  Popular.  Yeah.  Popular song.  And what if you can find a topical popular song with a topical...  Even better.  Even better.  You have to then sound like the singer, but you also have to mix it to where the music  isn't overpowering the lyrics.  So, because it's only a funny song because you can hear what the words are.  And, of course, please keep the shoehorning to an absolute minimum. 
[02:32:00]  Oh.  I was hoping just topical.  Oh, no.  It's topical.  But the government shutdown?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Would it be a surprise on your face, Sam?  I'm psyched.  All right.  What does the...  All right.  What does the fox say?  So, what do you think?  What do you think?  Now...  What do the socks say?  No!  Fuck!  Yeah!  All right.  That's fucking brilliant. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, it's going to be embarrassing.  I love baseball.  Socks go boom.  Playoffs now.  Valentine fired.  Fans cheering loud.  Fenway Park.  Big poppy.  Play is back with Gomes in Napoli.  Is that a shoehorn?  That's a shoehorn.  He's shoehorning.  Here's what it is.  Was that an example of a shoehorn? 
[02:33:00]  He's shoehorning, and he can't sing very well.  No, he can't.  He's not very good.  When we were doing song parodies, and certainly you did most of the writing...  Oh, I love a good song parodies.  We would sit there and just fucking rack our brains to try to find the right phrasing  or words.  Sometimes you've got to spend some time on it.  You toil over finding the right phrasing to put in so it fits kind of nicely.  You're like, I've got to knock a syllable out right here.  And look, occasionally you're going to have to shoehorn.  Even I understand that. 
[02:33:30]  Right.  But for the most part...  There's a lot of shoehorning.  You shouldn't shoehorn.  Like Todd from Scott and Todd, it's all shoehorning.  That's creativity.  There's none when you shoehorn the whole song.  That's shoehorn.  He was shoehorning, yeah.  Yeah, shoehorn.  Way park, big poppy.  Play is back with Gomes and Napoli.  Pitching staff with Lester's Ks and our bats go pow, pow, pow. 
[02:34:00]  But there's one sound that we all know.  What does the Sox say?  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell everything.  Sell, sell, sell, sell everything.  Lose all my money in a video game investor.  Sell, sell, sell, sell.  Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.  What's the bloody Sox say?  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  Oh, this is so bad. 
[02:34:30]  You think they're hoping that everyone...  It becomes a right cry.  It braces it, right.  Yeah, yeah.  They're going to play this at the stadium.  I know it.  I just know it.  I hate a baseball song parody thing where they say the player's name.  It's fucking hate it.  It's terrible.  It's so bad.  All right, that makes you go, hey, I like that.  Oh, hey, I know that flagger.  I like that one.  It's my favorite.  In their mind, this is how you doing.  This is definitely Boston's how you doing.  How you doing was very successful. 
[02:35:00]  All right.  How you doing, Yankees?  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  What does the socks say?  Beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer.  He's doing like that bad South Park voice.  Beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer.  What does the socks say?  Green, green, green, green, green, monster.  Green, green, green, green, monster.  Green, green, green, green, green, rawr.  Green, green, green, green, green, monster.  and then just like  everything else they do 
[02:35:30]  it just fades away  yeah  they got one  there's no ending  there's literally  not one laugh  to be had  in that song  not one?  do you think they  do you think they  take calls  and like  that sock song  is hilarious  could you play it  could you play  the sock  what does sock say song  yeah we'll get that  right on for you  thank you  hey  it's a song  that's sweep of the nation  the Red Sox nation  one person has  commented on one 
[02:36:00]  of their photos  farewell and adieu  to your Facebook page  oh there it goes  oh it's funny  that's a Jaws reference  yes  yes it is  farewell and adieu  alright  I demand that we stop  it's October right here  look  I cannot go forward  this is the moment  sometimes we stop  at a parody song  but sometimes  I bring it forward  because to me  this is the bit  that separates them  from all other shows  this is their marquee  I know  it's their benchmark bit 
[02:36:30]  it's benchmark  benchmark bit time  yeah  and when I read this  I can't wait for the reaction  in the room  as I said  this is what  I can't do this  this is what  Boston is a huge market  uh huh  this is what separates them  from the pack  and makes them  okay  the successful show  that they are  let's give it a shot  gotta hear that  alright ready  yeah  might redeem them  let me just read this  for the people  yes  it's gonna be a lot  of groaning  no I wanna hear it  Carson and Kennedy

[02:42:00]  is terrible  how could you do  well I didn't  so you're trying  to claim  that's way better  acting by the way  of course  then we'll hear  you're trying  to claim  that when your  family is about  to fall apart  audio fidelity  is not at the top  of your list  of concerns  right  and they couldn't  just put a mute  button on you  right  put you on hold  they need you  to be quiet  until you can't  be quiet  remember if I put  your hand over  the mouthpiece  of the phone  the father of  your children  has been betraying  you  hush  until you get

[02:43:00]  shit out there  you know maybe  we need to do  War of the Roses  why would you  sit there and go  hey man we got  to do that  War of the Roses  bit  why  I can get you  guys some  pre-packaged bits  can you get me  one  yes I can  alright good  come working on  something  what kind of bit  do you want  a prank call  War of the Roses  why do I have  to choose  why can't I  as Gene Simmons  once said  enjoy steak  and cheesecake  how about both  you're right  I'll get you  a little dessert  you know what  I would actually  like to do  good old Gene Simmons  changed his tune  did he  the one that was  completely against  marriage  yes he did  fell right in line 
[02:43:30]  that's right  remember how many  times he laughed  at the people  that were married  on this show  I won't get married  there's no reason  to enter into a  contract like this  where you're married  and you're losing  everything you have  you won't see me  ever do that  oh really Gene  I love a man  who can change his mind  oh god  the demon  changed his mind  the demon  fast forward  he's crying  like a little baby  with that plastic  face of his  oh no  saying how much  in love he is  shut up  she took me  for all my stuff  was he crying  when he got married  I don't know

[02:44:30]  the first thing  I'll send it to my wife  yeah yeah  alright yeah  send it to my wife  I'm married  it should be our project  it would probably  take weeks  to actually get something  to get one that  actually like  plays all the way out  like these people  supposedly they do this  what every morning  or every week  once a week  good good good  I might be wrong  one that plays out  but it would never  play out where he  sends it to  the girlfriend  it would always  play out where he  sends it to the wife  if it ever does  it would usually  end with like  no I'm not  interested  click  speaking of things  that don't work 
[02:45:00]  yeah  the Carson and  Kennedy Facebook page  is down  oh  why don't they  mind that  they're not on  Facebook anymore  what happened to it  I'm not sure  that's terrible  it really is terrible  it's terrible  we're sorry  well let's get  into the phone call  here guys  that'd be funny  yeah  oh they do this  every day  every day  every day  this is John  hi John  how are you today  I'm good  my name is Shelly  I'm calling from  your wireless provider  N word  wireless provider  why do they keep 
[02:45:30]  dropping N bombs  on the radio station  anyone else  notice that the  guy's completely  on guard  just because  the phone rang  hello  it's subtle  but he's already  on guard  because he's  he realizes  he's got to play  the part  he's got to play  he's a method  actor  he's already  in character  it's so subtle  well listen  he's completely  on guard  just because  he answered  a phone  at his house  what  who is this  what do you want  I'm not  cheating on my wife  fucking asshole 
[02:46:00]  I'll admit  it's very subtle  but listen  you hear him  hello  he's already  in character  even though  there's no reveal  yet  this is John  hi John  how are you today  I'm good  my name is  Shelly  I'm calling  from your  wireless provider  I'm calling  from our  customer service  department  and we're  thanking our  loyal customers  today by 
[02:46:30]  offering a  dozen red  roses  free of charge  and we're  going to go  ahead and  deliver those  anywhere in  the continental  United States  how does that  sound for you  today  that's amazing  so basically  I just need to  get some  information from  you so I'll  need a few  minutes of your  time do you  have a sec  sure  they follow  the same  fucking script  so does  anyone know  out there  is this a  company  that you  sign up  for the  war of the  roses bid  and they  got the  actors on  the other  side  there's no  way they're  doing it  within the  radio station 
[02:47:00]  because they  would run  out of people  you think  they're just  cutting in  like they  send you  I don't know  if they're  cutting in  but there  were guys  like Larry  the cable  guy was one  of them  he would  just call  a million  radio stations  with the same  stuff  so I'm  thinking you  sign up  to do the  war of the  roses prank  wherever it  is and then  they supply  the actors  and you got  the script  or they  just send  you the  audio of  the actors  and then  you do  cut it  you can hear  that there's  definitely a  live interaction  going on  yeah I know  you get the  actors from  the service  for a while  there I thought  they were doing  it within the  radio station  but if they're  doing this 
[02:47:30]  almost every  day or  every day  they would  run out of  people around  the radio  station  you think  that if this  station had  any listeners  whatsoever  eventually word  would get  around  if somebody  calls you  offering you  free roses  don't admit  that you're  cheating on  your wife  right  well there's  two actors  don't do  that  the guy  and the  girl actor  are probably  just fucking  you know  from the next  room from each  other  they both  hooked about  an ISDN  okay this is  Becky and  Rob and  they're going  to play  we do the

[03:41:00]  because my comedy  was different  those big balls  yeah  big heavy balls  Jim was always  a friend of me though  he always watched  heavy heavy weighty balls  they broke those  big fucking  that big delicious sack  that big fucking  cum spilling  angry sack  that giant cum factory  you call it  ball sack  wait you said  your comedy's different  why  you know  I'm not a traditional  guy talking about  you know  mayonnaise and bullshit  and ketchup  and being  friendly to TV  and you know  all that stuff 
[03:41:30]  mustard  yeah yeah yeah  definitely like  I just  I talk about my dad  being you know  an alcoholic  and a drug addict  and all kinds of stuff  what  that's hilarious  what happened there  but the  no I know the jokes  the networks are afraid  of originality though  that's what it is  that's why I love you guys  and all people are different  because  everybody's terrified  of originality  how bad was the  alcoholism  I drank  forever  from like age 14  to like  my late 30s  36  how old are you  my dad 
[03:42:00]  oh he was brutal  he was an animal  when he got drunk  oh boy  not fun huh  no  my mom's the best  she's a single mom  and she raised five of us  he'd hit you for  now he wouldn't be able  until he's old  but you know  but back then  I mean  no not really  he'd do a lot of  yelling and throwing  stuff  ok  still is bad  he's a reasonable  guy  this humongous  is a reasonable  man  he's a reasonable  guy  I'll talk to this  humongous  you see him still  actually he's pretty  sick right now  he's in a nursing home 
[03:42:30]  I gotta go visit him  actually  oh man  yeah  you know  what are you gonna do  what's on him  he has a problem  he couldn't breathe  then they had to  do an operation  on like a tracheata  whatever it is  tracheata  yeah  yeah  it's ok  I mean you know  things happen  how old a gentleman  is he  75  ok  he's up there  I'm the beautiful  age of 52  unfortunately  there you go  ok  I had to put you  younger than that 
[03:43:00]  oh thank you  I appreciate it  you don't have to  really  I know  I got the two  fingers  nice  double fingers  double fingers  no I  it's  I just love  doing what I do  I mean this is so  cool because  I mean it took me  a long time to get  where I did  but it's worth  every minute of this  yeah  what happened  Roland  Roland's sitting  back there  what's up  Roley  that movie made  me want to cry 
[03:43:30]  though  I can't  I can't stop  thinking of  Michael Douglas  oh man  the woods  the woods  whoa  I've never seen him  before  I'm not up this early  normally  I feel like  I missed an exhibit  with you guys  what movie made you  want to cry  De Niro's 
[03:44:00]  I'm like fuck  what happened to him  oh  and Michael Douglas  and that  and  oh god  Michael Douglas  looked great in there  you know he's all tan  nice full head of hair  that's a formula movie  it'll do well  whatever  he's just doing nothing  but garbage for years  they should have fucking  did something else  nobody has any balls  to do anything  they're afraid of their own shadow  De Niro  De Niro just gave up  on like  I mean  people just don't give him  good scripts anymore  I can't imagine that  even Silver Lining Playbook  got rewarded 
[03:44:30]  because it was the first thing  he did in years  that just was just  different than a dumb comedy  that was awful  like it's gotta be easier  to just do these shit movies  then it's like  oh my god  I gotta really act  and  right  I gotta be the guy for a while  get into the character  yeah yeah  it's  it's  it's because of  Meet the Parents  he was  he was really  he killed it in  Meet the Parents  especially the first movie  so now it's like  okay that's what  I gotta do now  a million of these  type of movies  that sucks  too bad  yeah  I wanted to  I wasn't impressed  with him in  Silver Lining Playbook  me neither  I thought he was alright 
[03:45:00]  but it wasn't  an over the top performance  by any means  that was a bunch of bunk  if you ask me  bring it back to Cape Fear  things like that  oh god Cape Fear  sure and you relate  to the way he  talks to a girl right  oh yeah  that's how you have sex  I hear you do the laugh  from Cape Fear  I actually like the movie  Full Metal Jacket  that's one of my favorites  so I'm just like  oh you do any  impressions from that movie  yeah Pile on the toilet  I like when he goes  Pile Joker Snowball  I just that's my favorite  when he's calling him out  and Pile I felt sorry  for him in the long run 
[03:45:30]  I mean he was  oh  yeah  yeah  but it was a good movie  though I like all the army  though I'd love to meet him  one day  we met him  oh really  oh yeah  he yelled at us too  really  yeah for real  he's a badass  though  I'm sure he can fight  still right  do you think  he's  well  not really  nowadays it's crazy  you didn't hear what  happened to him  which makes it really  awkward now  oh no  don't bring it up  I would like to 
[03:46:00]  tell you about  what happened  Netflix  new  new comedy special  Notorious  yeah  as long as the language  isn't very salty  well it's got Russell Peters  you know Russell Peters  he's great  he's one of the biggest  comedians in the whole  wide world  well  now  along with Orange  is the new Black House  Cards and Rest Development  you got  Notorious  that's his newest  special  Russell Peters

[03:57:30]  oh I was a boy scout  yeah  oh  so you know  they just never asked you  into the tent  well I also  believe it or not  for a short period of time  I joined the marines  when I was young  oh wow  how do you join the marines  for a short period of time  well  it was a mutual agreement  that I left actually  you know  you never do that  bygones be bygones  there's never a mutual agreement  it was like  you know  they were like  well  you know  the minute I get off the bus  all hell broke loose  was it after  the whole platoon  hit you with the soap  I got off the bus 
[03:58:00]  and all  this was like  what do you mean  all hell broke loose  a jelly donut  break it down  what happened  you had to run up  to like yellow footprints  and you would say  sir yes sir  right  and by mistake  well first of all  when they get on the bus  the guy looked like  all the army  sure  and he goes  you're now  in the United States  Marine Corps  you got three seconds  to get off this bus  so guys are pushing  fighting to get off  I'm like the last guy  off the bus 
[03:58:30]  I figure  fuck it  let me take my time  I'll get out there  when I'm ready  to get out there  you know what I mean  right  so I get out there  and they say  when you hear your name  you'll say  sir yes sir  so I went  yes sir  he goes  he looked at me  he goes  who's a dick sucker  that got a cock  caught down his throat  and said  yes sir  instead of sir  yes sir  he goes  what's it you  Liberace  I go  Liberace  I go  sir  he goes  your name is  Milton Bradley  from now on  some degree  so many games  to play with you  you're never going  to want to come back  Milton Bradley  oh wow 
[03:59:00]  but when I met  my drill instructor  he goes  I will turn you  into Lee Harvey Oswald  by the time of this  Jesus Christ  wow  he had to make you  more  like he had to  put you on medication  and make you more sane  to make you awful  it was great  because like  so how long were you  I was in for six weeks  the first phase of training  then they decided  to you know  how'd they break it to you  the guy said  well this isn't really  working out for us  well you really  wow  did he lose weight  were you  no I was in good shape  you were in pretty good shape  when uh 
[03:59:30]  actually  but what do you mean  they said it didn't work out  like what did you do  they said well you know  you're not actually right for this  you know what I mean  because  the marines  they never say that  even if they just want  some cannon fodder  were they mean here or no  no they were actually  by mistake one day  they must have went to the recruiter  and just went  what the fuck are you thinking  I haven't seen you know  we didn't see women for a few weeks  because you're down there  and then you  I don't know you were horny as fuck  oh yeah I seen women  I seen some woman marines  that like  looked like Vulcans from Star Trek  they were short  I didn't give a shit  what they looked like  I'm checking them out 
[04:00:00]  and everything you had to say  was sir yes sir right  yeah it is  so  that woman marine  comes over to me right  and I go to her  sir  I called her sir right  she goes  do I look like a sir to you  I go sir  so all of a sudden  my drilling circuit  stops the platoon  right he goes  uh oh  and my nickname was Space Cookie  that's how he called me  he goes  Space Cookie  I knew this had to be you  you gotta get that on a shirt  oh kid  Space Cookie  you gotta get Space Cookie  on a shirt 
[04:00:30]  Space Cookie  he's coming out  he goes  what did he do now  I'll buy one of those  he said he called me sir  instead of ma'am  so he looked at her  and said  that mistake is understandable  he just walked away  he was on my side for one  well it was probably  more fun for him  to goof on the bitch  than it was you  at that point  yeah  right there  I was  when I got there  I'm like  I thought this was gonna be  John Wayne charging over the hill  I'd get chicks  beat up bullies  and picked up  when I came back  oh man  I'm like John Wayne Gacy  I thought they'd get hot chicks  like beat up bullies  and picked up  hot chicks  you know 
[04:01:00]  they're like marines  and stuff  didn't work out that way  for you  no  oh god  because  when I got there  they were like  he gave us a speech  it's like  he said  my name is Sergeant Rivers  I'll do the speech  it was like  please do the speech  you really get into it  he goes  my name is Sergeant Rivers  you will refer to me as sir  for the next 12 weeks  I will be your mom  dad  boyfriend  girlfriend  bisexual pimpin bitch  he goes  my primary objective  is to teach you to kill  and I'm like  wait that last part  my primary objective  is to teach you to kill
