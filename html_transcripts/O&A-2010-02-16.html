<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about Kevin Smith's ejection from a Southwest Airlines flight.  A listener, "Rape Kid," initially brought up the incident, but the hosts played audio from Smith's Smodcast podcast detailing his experience. Smith explained he usually buys two seats due to his size but was only able to purchase one this time.  Despite initial accommodation from a flight attendant, he was later removed for "safety" reasons, a decision Smith felt was humiliating and potentially discriminatory.  The hosts and callers debated the airline's policy,  the situation's handling, and the perceived weight shaming, incorporating numerous jokes about Smith's weight. They briefly touched upon a new, inferior version of "We Are the World,"  the upcoming premiere of Smith's film "Cop Out," and their aversion to red-carpet events.  A caller, Ahmad Ali, checked in from the Vancouver Olympics, promising further updates later. The segment concluded with promotion of Jimmy Robinson's comedy CDs on iTunes.

The show continued with a discussion of the documentary "It Might Get Loud," focusing on Jack White, The Edge, and Jimmy Page.  The hosts and callers debated the musicians' skills and influence, discussing specific scenes from the film, including their jamming sessions and recording techniques (mentioning songs like "Whole Lotta Love" and "When the Levee Breaks").  The conversation shifted to the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, covering the opening ceremony malfunction, a luger's death, poor weather, and Ahmad Ali's further updates, including rumors of Rush's potential closing ceremony appearance.  Ali also commented on the Olympics' coverage and the Canadian women's hockey team's success, along with problems with the Zambonis.  The hosts also discussed Shane Koyczan's opening ceremony poem. A clip of New Hampshire representative Nancy Elliott making explicit, homophobic statements against same-sex marriage was played, followed by reactions from the hosts and callers.  The segment also included a discussion of a show-produced humorous video about Jimmy buying tampons.

Next, the hosts launched into a discussion about vaginal hygiene products, using explicit language. This transitioned into a scathing critique of the "We Are the World" remake, targeting its arrangement, celebrity choices (including Justin Bieber, Jennifer Hudson, Miley Cyrus, Enrique Iglesias, Jamie Foxx, and Wyclef Jean), and overall production, again using vulgar language.  Tom Green then joined the show in studio. The conversation covered his online show, MTV career, *Freddy Got Fingered*, past stunts (including one involving a cow's udder and a dead raccoon), and his battle with testicular cancer.  Listener calls followed, some recalling Green's bits, others discussing the "We Are the World" remake. The segment concluded with further discussion of Green's stand-up tour and more listener calls.

The final segment featured Tom Green discussing his testicular cancer experience, its effects on sexual function, and his divorce from Drew Barrymore.  The conversation continued with his MTV show, pranks involving his parents (including the "Where's My Dinner, Bitch?" statues and the "Slutmobile"), and stand-up career.  He recounted a guest destroying a Johnny Carson desk replica with a chainsaw and his experience on *Celebrity Apprentice*, including his elimination after drinking with Dennis Rodman.  Listener calls, a urologist's clarification on the effects of testicle removal, the Vancouver Olympics (specifically the Canadian gold medal in moguls), Rip Torn's arrest, and the box office performance of *Valentine's Day* and *Dear John* were all discussed.  The show ended with a *Family Guy* clip and a mention of Doug Fieger's death and Jim Florentine's collaborations with Green.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We still love doing radio, by the way.  Love it!  You heard it here, folks.  Don't I like it about our show?  It's fun and safe at the same time.  We're popular! 
[00:00:30]  See, we rule on the radio.  We have a good 40 minutes, an average 120, an hour of filler, and an hour of dread.  What the fuck is going on?  Stereo actor.  And you, I don't go to your job and suck all the dick that you work with.  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be starstruck.  Bum-ba-da-bam!  Who gives a shit?  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We are the world. 
[00:01:00]  We are the children.  Hey, don't mock that.  Don't mock it.  It's a wonderful, wonderful song.  A wonderful cause.  That's my favorite part of the new We Are the World.  I was, quite frankly, stunned when I saw it.  Wondering how they could actually remake the We Are the World worse than the original. 
[00:01:30]  More boring.  More outrageous.  Longer, it seems, anyway.  And with just...  It seems, it's almost twice as long.  Holy shit, really?  This is an epic, this fucking song.  It's horrendous.  It is horrendous.  What are they, they're too busy kissing each other's asses in Hollywood that no one notices  that they're putting together a piece of shit?  For a good cause.  Let's just throw that out there. 
[00:02:00]  And it's raising a lot of money.  But the song is a piece of shit.  Well, it's like four songs put into one, first of all.  There's rap, there's auto-tuning, there's old school, there's impressions, there's little  kids, I don't know.  They had to bring the auto-tuning to We Are the World because, of course, it is the decade  of the auto-tuning, I think.  Like, this will be looked back at as the decade of the auto-tune. 
[00:02:30]  Before we get into that and all the other things that happened over the three-day weekend,  a very busy three-day weekend, unbelievable.  Oh, my God, good.  Let's go to Rape Kid, because he's got a did-you-hear.  Wow, this is probably breaking news, right?  Yes, Rape Kid, what's up?  Good morning, Ope and Jimmy Robinson.  R.K.  Just wanted to tell you guys, I don't know if you saw the Twittering and all the websites,  but Kevin Smith recently got into a big kiss with Southwest Airlines. 
[00:03:00]  Look, Rape Kid.  He's making this up.  Hold on, before we all beat him up.  How long have you been listening to us, Rape Kid?  A long time.  I know the name.  Yeah, I know.  Why?  You go, it says, did you guys hear?  How would we not have heard that Kevin Smith got kicked off a flight?  It's 2010, for fuck's sake.  There's nothing anybody hasn't heard, if it even has the slightest bit of, like, popular 
[00:03:30]  culture to it.  Yeah, I know.  I'm glad you're all fucking dejected now.  You're contrite.  Is that right, Jimmy?  It certainly is.  He's being contrite here.  I was going to say, as a fellow fatty, I just wanted to offer my condolences to Kevin  Smith and his tribulation.  My condolences to the fat people.  We would love to get Kevin on the show, but I don't think it's going to happen, unfortunately.  I mean, we're the perfect place for him to discuss this. 
[00:04:00]  And we've had our issues with airlines.  I think we all agree with the Southwest policy on flying.  Well, if you're so giant...  Yeah, but that's why we need to, you know, hear the details from Kevin to see who's right,  who's wrong here.  Kevin's not a giant guy.  He's a big guy, obviously.  We all know that.  He's made no secret of it or anything.  I think he's a lot more self-conscious about it than he lets on in public. 
[00:04:30]  We've talked about it here on the show.  He wears a jacket everywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  He wears his big, you know, Silent Bob jacket everywhere.  He wears his fat well.  Yeah, he does.  He's not like that giant.  Tell you the truth.  There are people that are morbidly obese that cannot fit in one seat.  Kevin can sit in one seat.  And from what I heard, the test, apparently, is if you can fit with the armrests down in  the one seat without, you know, guts hanging over into other people's seats, then you're 
[00:05:00]  fine.  Right.  He demonstrated that and said, no, I fit.  And the flight attendant said, no, the pilot said that there is a safety issue.  And he goes, so I'm too fat to be on the plane.  And the stewardess said, I did not say that.  What I said was the pilot, the captain, has stated that you being in that seat is a safety  issue because certain people can only use up so much space on the aircraft. 
[00:05:30]  He goes, you're saying.  He goes, don't worry.  I'm not going to sue you.  But you're telling me I'm fat.  I'm too fat to fly on this plane.  And she goes, she insisted.  I am not saying that, sir.  You're just taking up too much room with your body to be on this plane.  This is where Southwest sucks.  I agree with their policy.  And what is that cheap fuck flying Southwest for?  You can't.  Come on, Kevin.  Well, he admitted that he likes to buy two seats because he likes to enjoy not sitting next 
[00:06:00]  to other people.  Not sitting next to other people.  He buys two seats normally.  He does.  With the coach seats.  He couldn't this time because there weren't enough seats.  The issue is you can't allow a guy to board a plane and then ask him to get off the plane.  He was on the plane.  Yeah.  That's where Southwest is despicable.  It's like I agree with the policy so people aren't inconvenienced.  Yes, get off, fatty.  But you can't humiliate people either.  I mean, there's a way to do stuff.  I think they should have one lone seat in the middle of the terminal where you have to go 
[00:06:30]  through the testing in front of everybody.  Oh, like where you put your carry on to see if it fits.  And then there's a seat and you see if your blubber hangs over it.  And preferably some kind of emcee that just gathers people around.  Oh, my God.  Some kind of Ringling Brothers and Barham Bailey Circus type thing with a spotlight.  And trumpeteers, possibly.  And if you're too fat, confetti shoots out of cannons.  How great would that be that you have to be tested in front of everyone before you go 
[00:07:00]  through the fucking...  Oh, how degrading.  It's almost like how else...  What they should do, the airline seats, you know how you put your seats down?  There should be something that goes from the bottom of your armrest to the seat.  And like little things that you can fold up in your seat.  Like on your...  The armrest, you should be able to raise a little divider on.  This way, every person can raise their own little dividers.  Almost like a little cubicle, but small.  Right.  And this way, if you're too fat, you won't be able to do that.  Right.  And if you're too fat, you're just crammed in. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Well...  Crammed in?  But they can't let you board the plane and then ask you to get off.  That's fucking terrible.  Yeah, that really is degrading.  That's humiliating.  It's just not the way to do it.  We got...  I mean, we can't get Kevin on today, which sucks, because, you know, he's been in front  of the show for a long time.  But we do have some audio of his smodcast.  You want to go there or what?  You want to hear in his own words what happened?  Yeah.  And then we got to get to this We Are The World thing.  And the Olympics.  Hopefully, some people are watching this Olympics thing. 
[00:08:00]  Southwest, I think, is probably taking a bigger beating than they expected.  They didn't expect to fuck with a guy who had 1.6 million Twitter followers.  Right.  And Kevin has a way...  He has like a Louis C.K. way of really describing things in a very, very simple and easy...  Like, he has a way of just really bringing things home when he tells a story.  He's a great storyteller.  And that's got to be...  Oh, yeah.  He's a very interesting guy.  Southwest is probably catching a fucking beating.  He sounded very honest about the whole thing.  He was talking...  And one funny part was how he's standing there and telling the woman, you know, just don't... 
[00:08:30]  Don't...  Don't do this.  Like, don't do this.  And she goes, no, you're going to have to follow me off the aircraft.  And he said at one point he looked over at what he called another fatty sitting in another  seat with his head down, just wondering if he was going to be the next one thrown off  the plane.  What is this?  This is fucking Germany, man.  I know.  What was it, the emergency?  Was he in the emergency room?  No, he was in the front row.  Let's find out.  We got the Smodcast here. 
[00:09:00]  He was in the front row.  I don't know how much of this we want to do, but let's at least try.  Welcome to Smodcast.  I'm Kevin Smith.  And I'm Jennifer Schwalbach.  This is kind of an emergency Smodcast.  I ran into...  I ran afoul of the airlines.  Well, let me get to the particulars.  I went this morning up to San Francisco.  Southwest Airlines, for those who don't know, is like, it's all, it's the greyhound of the  sky.  It's a bus.  It's an Airbus.  There is no first in class or coach. 
[00:09:30]  Now, when I fly Southwest, generally, I like to buy two tickets because I just don't...  Southwest flights are cheap.  They're fucking cheap.  Like, you could fly to Vegas for a hundred bucks some days.  So that way you and I can sit together.  Well, I mean, even if I'm traveling alone, I tend to buy two seats because I'm, A, I'm  flying on the welfare airline.  Totally.  Food stamp airline.  Like, I think I can indulge myself with two seats because it is an Airbus. 
[00:10:00]  And when you are sitting next to...  It's coach.  And I can afford to do it.  I mean, yes.  So, if we fly together, then we get a whole row.  Exactly.  Like, you know, that way we can have space dreams, but we cuddle up and shit like that  and one can lay...  Got to stop this for a second because we got...  I think we explained ourselves, but you get people like this.  Ringo from Y-Town.  Oh, Yorktown, Ohio, I guess.  Quit standing up for this fat pig.  Anybody else you would crucify?  That's not true.  I wouldn't crucify somebody if the fucking airline allowed them to... 
[00:10:30]  We actually did stick up for one fat guy where the airline had allowed them to fly halfway.  Like, they allowed them to fly there, but then coming back, they didn't.  It's almost like if there's going to be an issue, it should be before you board your first  flight.  Because then it's just too arbitrary.  Like, what?  I wasn't too fat to fly to Connecticut, but a day later, I'm too fat to fly back?  It's too fucking arbitrary.  What did you eat?  That's not true, dude.  Whatever asshole wrote in.  Why would you acknowledge anybody who writes in? 
[00:11:00]  They're just fucking people who won't call.  I hate those fucking people.  Well, no, because it brings up discussion.  That's all.  That's true.  I don't give a fuck what they have to say on instant feedback when they're trashing  us, but it brings up discussion.  That's all.  Yeah.  I mean, we said on our show that we agree with Southwest policy, but we're not sure of  the details here, you stupid fuck.  That's why we're listening to the Smodcast to get more details, you fucking internet  tough guy.  And I don't think Kevin is too big.  Call the show, Ringo, you fuck, because you're now banned from instant feedback. 
[00:11:30]  I don't think Kevin's too big to fit the criteria of being kicked off a fucking plane.  He's not.  And Kevin, I think there's at one point he said, because I read about it.  Yeah, but we haven't seen him in a while, and he's smoking a lot of pot.  We don't know.  Is he?  Yeah.  I mean, the Munchies could be taking over at this point.  He might be a big, fat person now.  And the issue is the way they did it.  It's not their policy.  I don't even think he's protesting their policy.  You don't walk out of a plane and drag a guy off once you've let him on.  And it was the same woman that was at the ticket, like the counter, that let him in the 
[00:12:00]  jetway.  Yeah.  So she's the one that came walking in because apparently, and she got, she took the responsibility  off herself by saying, the captain has told me that you are too fat to be on this plane  in so many words.  So, you know, she let him go in.  And once the captain saw him on the plane, decided he had to go.  So it wasn't like they let him on the plane.  And then he's like, well, who's the captain? 
[00:12:30]  Like, what's his name?  What is he?  She wouldn't give him any info.  Captain was having a bad day, huh?  Why wouldn't she give him any info?  Why is the fucking captain's name a secret?  It wasn't Sully, I'm sure.  Yeah, it wasn't Sully.  Sully would allow that to happen.  He names the captain.  Sully would have fucking landed the plane on Kevin Smith's back if he had to.  Yes.  I enjoy a good humiliation, trust me.  But, I mean, if you're already sitting in your seat, you've got to figure this shit  out before they enter the plane.  They really do. 
[00:13:00]  Would the captain have said if he felt the guy?  It was too Islamic looking, let's just say.  Would he have had the fucking balls to do that?  Yeah.  There you go.  He kicks a fat white guy off the plane.  I would love to see if he would have said, look, I don't like the way that guy looks.  I don't like the look in his face.  It's making me uncomfortable.  I wonder if it was a gentleman or a woman of color.  I wonder if the captain also would have ejected that person off, thus opening himself up to  the racist angle, which, of course, I've brought up within minutes of being on the 
[00:13:30]  program.  They may have.  I don't know.  Southwest boots people off.  But I just don't like the fact they let you board the plane.  You can't let the guy board the plane.  How about the captain?  If the captain's going to say, who's too fat?  How about the captain does a quick scan before he gets on?  Right.  Fatty, fatty, fatty.  Or you allow somebody, your gate check people, to make that call.  Duck, duck, pig.  Duck, duck, pig.  You play fatty, pig, fatty.  Fatty, pig, fatty with the passengers.  Imagine the captain's going down touching everyone's head.  Duck, duck, duck, pig. 
[00:14:00]  You're off.  Let's get back to the smart cast here.  Cuddle up and shit like that.  One can lay in one's lap.  So Southwest, I like to go.  I like to take two seats.  So I'm at the counter.  So I'm like, hey, I've got this ticket from up front.  And they're saying that, I don't know.  I can't understand.  On the front of the ticket, it says to hand it in for a boarding pass.  I don't know if I was supposed to do that now or later or something like that.  And a little dude pipes in.  He's like, that happens at 10 after.  And I was like, okay.  But am I on a list or something like that? 
[00:14:30]  And Suzanne looks and she's like, you are on a list.  But it's a very, very packed flight.  And I was like, okay.  And she was like, and if everyone checks in, there's only going to be one extra seat left.  And I was like, am I at the top of the list?  She's like, yeah.  I was like, great.  I'll take it.  I don't, don't worry about my two seats, man.  I'll leave one.  I don't give you, I just want to go home.  And she stops Suzanne at this point.  Kind of pauses a little bit and goes, you know, there's the other, the safety issue.  And I go, what do you mean safety issues? 
[00:15:00]  You go, well, I mean, you just have to, if your arm rests have to be able to, and she's  really like trying to struggle to find the terms.  And I'm confused because I'm like, what, am I sitting next to a door?  Do you need me to open the door if the plane goes down?  I can do that.  That's not what it is.  You know, I may not be Albert Einstein, but I'm pretty quick.  And eventually it caught up to me.  And I go, this is what drives me nuts about the airlines is the language they use.  Can't they just, oh, I know they're trying to be nice.  It's kind of hard to come off and go, look, you might be too fat, but there's got to be 
[00:15:30]  a way to say it.  Stop saying it's a, it's not a safety issue.  That's not why people are asked to buy two seats.  It's a comfort issue, which is okay.  But again, stop dolling it up with it.  It's a safety issue.  If it was a safety issue, people that have to be brought in on wheelchairs should not  be allowed to fly.  Exactly.  Because they are blocking someone from getting out.  And it's a hindrance to get them off as opposed to somebody who's got legs at work.  Oh my God, it's way worse.  They've got legs to move their fat around. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry, we can't find your wheels in the flaming wreckage.  Could you please get out of the way?  And kids would be.  I would pick up someone from a wheelchair and beat the flames out with them with his useless  turn of legs.  Of course you would.  No, you pick him up and you spit him in his worthless legs helicopter and put the fire  out.  Nice legs, dick.  You're right, kids.  Kids, and then you have to add kids to the list as well. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, kids are on the list now.  Because if it's only a safety issue, then only healthy people that can evacuate a desperate  situation on a plane should be allowed to fly.  Gay people?  Well, they'd be looking at other men's asses as you're standing in line to get off and  probably try to put their wee-wee in there.  They know how to throw a hissy fit.  So, you know, you can't have them in your way as the plane is in peril.  Well, I don't need, when I'm trying to get off a plane, a man pinching my fanny. 
[00:17:00]  I love people who are totally out of touch with the way gays live.  They're going to pinch me on the way out.  That's not out of touch.  Stirring feces around with your-  Wiggling excrement with their penises.  Oh, you heard that clip?  Yeah, we'll get into that.  Oh, boy.  All right, good.  We'll get into that one.  That is the clip of the morning.  Wait till you hear that one.  Fun little clip.  Congresswoman?  Please, we talk-  Oh, is she angry?  She's a Republican from New Hampshire.  Yeah.  Nancy Elliott.  We can talk about her at one point.  That's why we can't spend too much time on this Kevin Smith thing. 
[00:17:30]  We have way too much to talk about today.  This ties in with Kevin because he does kind of like being fucked in the butt.  Yeah, why not?  He'd be open about that.  If you follow him on Twitter, if you follow him on Twitter,  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's a married man.  But he hints at some things every once in a while.  Premieres next week, by the way, of the film.  Are we going?  I haven't gotten my invite yet.  I just knew it.  We're never going to have a Hollywood friend.  I was almost friends with Kevin Smith.  I went to a hockey game with him. 
[00:18:00]  That was cool.  I don't think Kevin – Kevin is not blow-off type guy.  He's just been – he doesn't handle the day-to-day stuff with invites.  I would love to go see cop out.  I'm sure you can.  At the premiere.  I'm quite sure you can.  No red carpet shit.  I don't think I'm a red carpet guy.  I'm a side door guy.  You should think you're red –  No, no.  You are a red carpet guy.  I'll sit in the back row.  I don't care.  No, you are a red carpet guy.  That's not true.  You guys absolutely are.  You can't think that – yes, you are.  I don't want to think as myself as a red carpet guy. 
[00:18:30]  Dude, I have the same shame you do.  I understand it.  I'm more of a beige carpet guy.  No.  Beige carpet.  Beige carpet with a cranberry stain.  With a few stains.  No.  Speaking of movies, I got to talk about The Blind Side a little later, too.  If anyone has seen it in the room, I doubt it.  I have not yet.  All right.  But you guys, stop thinking you're not red carpet.  You are.  I don't want to be a red carpet guy.  I want to see cop out, though.  I want to be at the premiere.  I want to be able to be in my seat and go, ooh, I think that person's famous over there.  You're like me.  You have shame on the red carpet. 
[00:19:00]  Believe me, I hate –  Really?  Dude, I did the red carpet a couple times, and there's nothing better than seeing all the camera guys take a rest from taking pictures because you're walking the red carpet.  It's horrible.  And then just when you pass them all, then you see the flash going off for the next person.  That's it.  It's like, wow, it's awful dark.  Right.  I'm not going to be humiliated again.  Fuck them.  My eyes aren't – I'm not squinting.  What happened?  Right.  Nothing more awkward than fucking doing that. 
[00:19:30]  Do you know when I do that –  I've said no to red carpet a million fucking times.  No, I never say no.  I'll actually just go when I'm on there.  Take some pictures.  Come on.  I shame them into taking pictures of me.  Do you know who I am?  They don't.  It's awful.  I hate the red carpet for that reason.  All right.  Back to Kevin Smith and the Smodcast on this Southwest thing.  Bought up to me.  And I go, oh, you thought I bought two tickets because I'm fat.  I said, ma'am, I am – look, I'm fat.  I'll be the first to tell you I'm fat, but I ain't that fat yet where I got to buy two seats to fly on Southwestern. 
[00:20:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Like for fat people, there's a bar, and I haven't hit that bar yet.  So, no, no, I just buy two.  That's not because of my weight.  I just don't like people.  I don't like to sit next to people.  And she was like, oh, oh, okay.  And I was like, so please, if there is one seat, don't worry about my other one.  I didn't want to say – you already blew 200 bucks for me the other day.  But I was just like, what's going on?  I think Kevin misread her.  I think she was trying – and again, I wasn't there, but I think she was trying to say there might be an issue if we can only get you in one seat. 
[00:20:30]  She was trying to say that politely, and he might have thought she was trying to say, look, sir, I know you want two seats.  Like, you know what I mean?  Because he's going, no, I don't like sitting next to – she might have been saying there's the safety issue.  Like, they might have to not let you on.  It was a big fuck up on their part is what it was, though.  I think so, too.  I mean, come on.  200 bucks for me the other day.  But I was just like, don't worry about the other one.  It's cool.  I hand my two tickets over, and they hand me back two pieces of paper.  One is a ticket, and one is like a drink ticket because I was flying the business – it's not even business class. 
[00:21:00]  It's just like you pay an extra 15 bucks or some such shit.  To get to the front of the line.  You get to the front of the A section, and they give you a free drink on the plan.  I don't drink booze, so it's a complete fucking waste, but I like being at the front of the line, so that helps, too.  So she gives me two documents, and I'm looking at them.  I'm going to go, oh.  I said, but what do I do?  I had two tickets.  She's like, there's only one seat.  And I was like, oh, I understand, but what do I do about the other ticket that I had?  And she was just like, there's only one seat.  Just get on the plane.  You're going to miss the plane. 
[00:21:30]  The door is going to close.  I'm like, ma'am, I understand.  I'm just looking for a little information here.  I gave you two tickets.  Now I have one ticket.  Where did that money go?  She's like, it'll just be credited to your account.  Just go.  And I was like, you know what?  It's unfair.  I just want a little information.  She goes, you know, I'm sorry.  And I was like, that's all.  It's just a simple question.  Right.  And I'm literally like that.  I'm not downplaying myself.  Believe me, I'll do the impression of me later on where I start getting tired.  But at this point, you know me.  I don't.  Never rude. 
[00:22:00]  Death before discourtesy is my fucking mantra.  Because you never want to give anybody something to say.  Never.  It may not be altruistic.  I'm not going to say like, I'm like fucking St. Francis of Assisi.  I love all animals and shit.  And human beings as well.  Or Joe.  You have exceptional manners.  I was raised very well.  And also, it's not completely altruistic.  I never want to give anyone cause to be like, that fucking Clark's asshole.  Blah, blah.  Never.  Never.  So, I'm heading toward the door.  There's a dude at the doorway. 
[00:22:30]  I hand one dude my ticket.  He takes it.  He goes, thanks.  I was like, I'm good.  Anything else?  He goes, you're all good.  I was like, whew, I made it.  And there's a dude, another dude, who's not, I guess he is going on the plane.  I'm not sure.  I never saw him again.  So, he must have went on the flight.  He's in the doorway.  And he sees me coming in.  He goes, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Who are you?  And I go, oh, they just, I'm a standby guy.  And they put me on.  And he goes, well, are you remember that?  And he said something to somebody else.  Is he remember that?  And I was like, I didn't know what the word was.  And I was like, what is that, man?  Am I being declassified as fucking luggage? 
[00:23:00]  And he goes, what?  And I go, it might be declassified as luggage, dude.  And he goes, no.  I said, revenue.  And I was like, what does revenue mean?  He goes, revenue means you pay for your ticket.  I said, oh, yeah, I paid for my ticket.  Oh, what did he think?  You looked like a hobo?  Or like, you know, I was a person who had missed.  No, no, no, no.  Had missed some other flight.  And they give you some make-up ticket.  Like, he was saying, you paid for this.  Revenue means I paid for that flight.  Oh, I see. 
[00:23:30]  It wasn't like some make-up ticket or some frequent flyer bullshit.  Got it.  When you pay cash, they'll, you know, they're like, look, we got to take care of people who pay cash.  Never mind.  People are like, I saved my points.  You know, it's just like cash first.  What?  I understand exactly what he's saying.  He's, is it a revenue ticket?  I mean, is it an upgrade ticket?  Did you pay for it?  A lot of times, he just explained it.  I don't need to re-explain it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Steven asked from Bayshore, Kevin misheard her because he was fiddling with a 16-pack of ring dings at the time. 
[00:24:00]  And the rapper was loudly a crinkling.  I guess one of the things is because we know Kevin, and he is the politest guy.  He's not going to just be a dick to somebody.  Of course.  He'll be smiling and making jokes.  I love that.  Things like that.  I love that Steven S. from Bayshore is making a lot of fat jokes because he's about a year, maybe two years away from having to buy two seats.  Getting kicked off planes, yeah.  Let's be honest with each other, Steven S.  Enjoy your fun now, sir.  Wow.  That's rough. 
[00:24:30]  You want more of the Smodcast?  Absolutely.  All right.  In two hours, happens again to the girl sitting next to Kevin.  I get on to the next flight.  I immediately go for the first fucking row right up front, cram into my corner.  Wait, wait, hold on.  What happened with that flight right there?  I'm confused now.  Did we cut this up?  Well, we had to, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  But he might have cut a critical part.  He might have cut a critical part.  Because why is Kevin saying next flight?  Next flight?  Well, I could go, all right.  Was this his flight home? 
[00:25:00]  No, I could do another track.  But, I mean, this is going to start getting really long.  That's all.  I'm trying to get to the meat and potatoes.  No, no, but did he get asked to leave this flight?  Well, how about E-Rock, who is the only one that heard the entire Smodcast come in here,  so maybe he could fill in some of these gaps.  Yeah, E-Rock could just sum it up.  So I don't have to play another seven-minute track here.  No, it just sounds to me like that was the flight one way,  and then on his way home is when he hit, like, the big bullshit.  No, because Stephanie was the one he said at the counter. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, really?  He just said her name's Stephanie, so it's the same woman.  E-Rock's very confused.  He has no clue.  Yeah, we're not too sure how to describe it.  Oh, no, I just, I'm looking to get no clue, E-Rock face.  He doesn't know.  E-Rock.  Yes.  You're the only one that heard the Smodcast.  We're confused.  Okay.  It's very entertaining.  I just played track two.  Kevin, his approach gets off the plane.  Is that the first flight?  Yeah.  Is that the flight going there?  Is that the flight he got kicked off?  Where are we?  Track two is the flight where that Suzanne lady came and talked to him, 
[00:26:00]  and what you said earlier about he made eye contact with the fat guy?  Yeah, yeah.  No, I'm talking about, like, he said, and now the second flight.  So what happened?  The first flight was fine?  We skipped to track four, because track three is another seven minutes,  and I don't want to invest in it.  A few hours later, they get him on another flight.  So this is his second flight for that day.  Oh, okay.  So we missed the part where he got asked to get off the flight.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Should we play track three?  Track three was just how they tried to.  It was about them giving him a $100 voucher, trying to make things good,  and him getting upset, saying that wasn't good enough. 
[00:26:30]  All right, good.  This is where we need Kevin Smith in, man, because he's out of having Kevin here to explain it.  I understand he doesn't want to talk to, like, the media,  but we're, like, I think we're different enough, man.  We could have a little fun with this.  He wants this.  He wants his smartcast played all over.  Is it that he doesn't want to talk to people?  No, I understand that, but fuck, you know, the smartcast is getting promoted like hell.  Is it that he doesn't want to talk to people, or is it that he's doing?  No, he's not doing anybody.  He's been Twittering everything possible from his point of view about what's been going on,  and he turned down Good Morning America, Larry King, Fox, all these other people. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, he did?  He's not doing any press about this.  He's not, so I understand, but.  And there's probably something to do with the film, too.  He's probably waiting until the film releases,  and then he'll start doing press about this and that together because it's closer enough.  You might remember him as Quiet Richard from the movies, Clucks.  All right, so.  He turned down Good Morning America.  So could someone summarize before we play this track four, because now I'm confused.  Where are we at?  All right, track four is.  No, what have we learned so far? 
[00:27:30]  They were questioning him as a safety issue, which he thought.  What flight was this, coming home?  Coming home from San Francisco.  I still don't get the two flights.  So how did he get to San Francisco?  Did he walk?  No, he flew earlier, but that.  Flew with two seats, so no one is questioning.  Yeah, he had no problem.  All right, because I'm one of the spoon feed people.  It's early still.  So he flies to San Francisco.  He's got the two seats.  No one's sitting next to him.  No one gives a shit.  On the way back, they kick him off the plane.  This is where it became a problem.  And now this is the second flight.  Yeah, he was already removed off the flight that he was sitting on.  Gotcha.  And this is the second flight two hours later. 
[00:28:00]  We just heard the first part where he's getting on the first leg coming home.  Right.  Well, he hasn't been removed yet.  From the flight.  No, he's been removed.  Because now in two hours, he's on another flight here.  So why are we going to the part where he's on another flight when we couldn't hear the part where he gets actually kicked off the plane?  We actually missed the part where he got removed from the flight.  Was that explained at all?  Yeah, I think so.  No.  No, because he just didn't.  He didn't even talk about getting removed yet.  On the first part, he's getting on the plane.  Part one sets up part two. 
[00:28:30]  Part one is when he's handing in his tickets to get his boarding pass.  Yeah, he's just gotten the ticket.  He's talking to some people.  And they're already pegging him as a safety hazard.  He said he's revenue.  And then now we've got to get into when he's kicked off.  Yeah, what happened?  We're skipping the whole important part.  Then why don't you highlight track three then?  Because that's not what he's talking about.  Track two is the one that's highlighted.  I did track two.  You did track one.  I did track two. 
[00:29:00]  Uh-oh.  You played track one.  Track two is where he's actually on the plane and they confront him to get off the plane.  Now it all makes sense.  You best play track two.  Wait a minute.  And if it's wrong, Erock gets something.  Hold on a minute.  Something tells me.  Hold on a minute.  Sam's so happy.  Something tells me Gregorio played the track and Erock is incorrect.  Something tells me that Erock.  That's where something doesn't make sense here.  Put on track two.  If you're confused out there, please raise your hand.  Put on track two.  And let's hear if we have just heard this. 
[00:29:30]  How about this?  If Erock is right.  No gay stuff, please.  Please.  Oh, forget it.  No more gay stuff.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I was just going to suggest that if Erock is right, everybody kisses.  We basically had hardcore homosexuality on Friday.  So let's blow off the gay stuff for a while.  Come on.  Maybe we force Erock to eat vagina.  That would be crazy for our show.  Oh, my God.  Yay.  He'll eat anything, though.  Thumbs up, right?  Mayo on it.  Let the record state I'm looking at track two. 
[00:30:00]  So let's see if this is what I played.  So we get into it.  I walk onto the plane.  It is.  Oh, shit.  I played track one, which fucked up the whole goddamn bit.  Oh, damn.  Is this what we heard right here?  Welcome to Smart Guest.  That's track one.  Yes, that's track one.  That's track two.  That would be a very odd.  Ah.  Strange way.  See, that was a long setup.  But now we're going to get to the.  See, we didn't need that.  No, we really kind of did.  And it was nice to hear.  See, that's why Erock highlighted track two, which I should have went to. 
[00:30:30]  I thought I went to track two, to be completely honest with you.  All right.  So here's track two.  Oh, look at Erock smiling.  Now it all makes sense.  This is rare.  This is rare.  Enjoy it, fatso.  I think.  I think.  You're too fat to be in our studio.  Get out of here.  I think Erock looks like he lost a little weight.  He's not.  He goes, yes.  Oh, he's kidding.  He did the not.  He does look like he lost a little weight.  Stay close, Erock.  We might need you.  Kick him off a C-130.  See, I'm sitting here going. 
[00:31:00]  I'm sitting here going.  This doesn't make sense.  Where's the part where he was confronted?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Just led up to the confrontation.  And I said, we don't want to spend too much time on this.  We're already 45 minutes in.  And no one else is working around here.  We are, though.  Fucking losers that we are.  This entire place has this week off except for us.  Anyone else notice?  Is everybody off?  Winter vacation.  Have you seen anyone yet?  Oh, I don't begrudge any man who has a better agent than us, which is every man.  Shit. 
[00:31:30]  There's not a person in these hallways today.  I think even the morning mashup is taking the week off.  I like that.  Jesus.  Come in here.  It's all nice and left alone.  So we get into it.  I walk onto the plane.  It is packed.  Because it's fully loaded at this point.  Everybody's loaded up.  I'm immediately doing the do-do-do-do-do-do Bionic Man scan of the fucking joint to see  where is the least embarrassing place for a man of my size to plant himself right up front 
[00:32:00]  in front of everybody two women sitting apart with a seat in the middle of both very slight  very little women um i'm like all right fucking if it's got to be the front row between these two  ladies so be and one is like why doesn't he use his stardom though say hey i'm kevin smith i know  i'm a bit on the large side recognizable i'm gonna sit in between you guys and talk about my latest  movie cop out everyone recognizes kevin smith i think he's so recognizable that he doesn't even  have to say anything dude that's i mean if there's a real big fat celebrity sitting i i wouldn't 
[00:32:30]  care i'd be like holy shit that's whoever patrice o'neill that's patrice o'neill lindsey lowland  kevin smith we forget how famous he is because he comes in and hangs out for four hours like a  regular he has fucking almost two million twitter followers yeah that's a famous fucking guy one  point excuse me i'm the producer of the opian anthony joe that's right what do you mean i have to buy  two glory holes i should not have to buy an extra fist for my seat 
[00:33:00]  i need to buy two planes  it's like adorable like squishy as a button like a big prune older than fuck but adorable like little  like little old lady and shit when i sat down she's like hello so before i said i've loaded my bag  stewardess was just like right here here's a place put your bag here sit down two and two ladies  i'm like hello hello just as i'm reaching for my fucking seat belt which look i'm not saying i buckle 
[00:33:30]  the seat you know as easily as i fucking comb my hair it takes a degree of but i can buckle that seat  belt still and that is a hallmark for any fat person so you know i'm going to buckle and all of a sudden  suzanne oh good old suzanne from up front comes in leans down and she goes mr smith hi um we have  kind of a problem so suzanne leans down and goes mr smith we uh kind of problem i said what's what is  it and she goes um captain uh says that you can't sit here that's when it starts dawning on me oh my 
[00:34:00]  and i go why because i don't want to say are you saying what i think you're saying and i'm  looking to the women either side of me to be like did you fucking bitches sell me and she goes well  no it's just it's a safety issue now if he's in the front of the plane that's where you want larger  people right yeah so they're first out you just push them right when you want the larger the a big  person very close to the yes that's it they can block it so no one gets sucked out the rapid 
[00:34:30]  deceleration his body makes another whole exit as it flies through the front of the plane you don't  want the perfect you don't want the fat people in the middle of the plane no because when everyone's  in a panic that's when it gets ugly you're not going to get past those people but do you see how  they're using the word safety it's not a safety issue right you're right and was right and you were  right fucking wheelchairs and kids were very old people they wouldn't allow fucking invalid like you  know yeah so stop saying safety to be politically correct cripples i'm sorry you're a cripple you 
[00:35:00]  can't be on this plane yes excuse me you're the bottom of your sneakers is pristine take the bus  those treads are not worn out at all on those sneakers it's just it's a safety issue a security  measure and i said wait safety security what are you talking about and she's like i'm sorry how is  that explanation justified hold well that's the story like so i'm like what what do you i mean but 
[00:35:30]  ma'am i just i'm fine i'm sitting down she's like well it's just if you can't lower the armrests  then we're not we can't let you you know what she wanted to say was you're too fat you have to buy  two seats but this plane's too full so you can't buy two seats so you're gonna have to go but she  kept insisting that the captain that the pilot was saying this and i'm gonna stop right there  because matt has a very good uh observation about that matt in connecticut go ahead sir hey boys i don't  know anyone caught this or not but when you get on an airplane the captain's never outside he's 
[00:36:00]  always running checks on dials and whatever but i mean someone ratted him out that's what i'm  thinking or the captain don't forget he's in the front row a lot of times the captain will turn  around and look back the captain may have seen him because he was in the front row yeah the captain  sometimes is right there and he'll just turn around and go look at the other guy up here i don't know  if he can uh i don't know if he could exit uh the three feet in front of him but do you see how  this soft language at the door you see how this fucking dishonest bullshit polite language like if they 
[00:36:30]  would have said to him like look kevin you're a big guy you're gonna require two seats before he got  on the plane but she's like oh it might be a safety issue and i understand it's hard to say  but if you just if you're polite and respectful and honest with people she would have saved this  poor guy the humiliation of sitting on the plane first with uh with kevin in the front the pilot  probably was like ah the last thing i want to do now is set the elevator trim uh with the little  dial imagine if that was his whole thing he's just too lazy to sit there and go like now i got 
[00:37:00]  to trim the plane out just because one fat guy's in front or else my nose is going to be down  no it's true they don't they have to trim it out they don't trim it on jets and fucking air buses  but that's what i'm saying i'm giving like that's a joke about how fat kevin would have to be  i'm giving it to be like i just want to trim this thing out i'm giving you this for  nonsense knowledge who cares nobody would say cares you know that trim the elevator right who 
[00:37:30]  knows what that means you're right i'm sorry it's just kind of it's a funny avionics joke  you forget what show you're on i like the avionics i know you do you're you'd be a big hitter on the  pilot's convention and i'll be drinking put your cat in town this kid he's got a good doozy  but nobody else knows what you mean now we got a pilot checking in oh great a little light from  the stove i love airline humor too jim on long island what's up jim hey i'm right here morning 
[00:38:00]  guys how you doing hi we uh just getting back to uh what was going on with kevin we were when we're  uh uh getting things ready up there we have no clue and don't care what's going on in the back  of the cabin so we that pilot had nothing to do with it your phone's crap uh i think i think we  got this point yeah he says no clue the pilots have no clue and don't care what's going on in the cabin  unless he hears you  then you start looking back i was singing i was saying this and i was just like i'm looking because 
[00:38:30]  the pilot where i'm sitting there is no way possible for the pilot to see me because i can't  see the pilot all right even if i leave all the way to the left across the woman who's sitting next  to me there's no way this man could have fucking seen me so she's saying like the captain's saying  you've got you've got to get up and i was like are you oh i and i literally said please don't do  this to me are you serious like are you telling me to get up i was like everybody like this plane's 
[00:39:00]  full right and she's like yeah and i was like but ma'am i i the armrest look and i put the armrest  both down right i was like they were just up because they were up when i sat down like these  ladies had them up i i'm not and and i was like i asked them i mean ma'am are you squished and the  lady to my left was like it's only an hour flight right which is fine i mean that's not the answer  i was looking for but the little old lady next to me can't hear shit and i'm just like ma'am am i  squishing you and she goes what and i go squish what i make the squishy look squish and she goes 
[00:39:30]  i'm fine and i was like they're they're both fine and the lady and suzanne goes yeah um i'm sorry  he's i just please this is really can you you know i we can we'll try to make it up to you outside oh my  god there is no making up at this point i'm like i got one or two things to do i could sit here and  defiantly be like no i'm not getting up because i was not not fitting in my seat you had your seatbelt  on and you had both of the arm i didn't but i didn't get to put my seatbelt on because there  was no i was about to put my seatbelt on but that didn't happen she wasn't giving me a choice i put 
[00:40:00]  the armrest down which is supposed to be the southwest test i don't know if it was her that's  the thing i don't know if it was her my guess it was the fucking dude in the jetway the dude who was  like revenue that guy that guy i think it was that dude and i think that dude like after i sat down  fucking like waved her over because before i put up my bag and before i was in the seat  13 seconds before suzanne was there and she was all the way over at that other fucking desk  right so this was in motion before i even got into the plane before i hit a seat before i got into the 
[00:40:30]  aisle before a fucking phantom pilot that saw me saw me and you know this i i don't know where it came  from but it wasn't as she represented it so i'm sitting there going what do i do like this is  potentially fucking humiliating and all of a sudden i'm thinking i gotta get up and everybody's gonna  fucking know everybody's either gonna know i was too fat or according to these fuckers or assume i  was too fat or think i was like a shoe bomber oh god you know what i'm saying i'm like am i a 
[00:41:00]  fucking terrorist like what is the safety issue are they what's the safety issue i'm like i keep asking  later on i'm like am i gonna explode is that in my the dude in monty python's like what safety issue  are you talking about and nobody will nobody will fucking say it so i'm looking at suzanne and  suzanne's making it clear that this is going to happen i quietly got up collected my bag this is  the moment though this is the moment everything's going to be okay because ultimately it's just going 
[00:41:30]  to become a story that you're going to tell for the rest of your life as i stand and go to my get  my bag i make perfect eye contact with a man who is far fatter and wider than me squeezed in also to  a middle seat three four rows back perfect eye contact right and at this moment you know if i  have a lack of character i'm gonna be like what about tubby what about him you would never do that  i would never throw a fellow fatty under the bus or playing as it were so i i was don't say anything 
[00:42:00]  but that dude's fucking eyes locked with mine had this panicked expression of like please don't tell  please don't tell oh no i can't laugh at that because he saw me getting taken away and he's  like i'm way fatter than him yes this dude looks so panicked and so i collected my bag went off the  plane now you're that flight attendant the person that worked and taken away and he's like i'm way  fatter than him yes this dude looks so panicked and so i collected my bag went off the plane now you're  that flight attendant the person that works the fucking desk you're suzanne how fucking tripping 
[00:42:30]  over yourself are you to like fucking make sure that i'm not like crying right at this point i  wait in the jetway she's still doing her shit then i'm like i fucking slowly walk up the jetway  depressed seeing a camera shot from behind me of the wide man walking the lonely up the jetway  with his head hung low dragging his bag he sees it like a director yeah seeing the camera shot of him 
[00:43:00]  of course walking up the jetway how embarrassing that is pretty bad man and they they offered him  a hundred these dummies yeah yeah a hundred dollar voucher this shitty airline  the cheap fuck is taking southwest so huh the cheap fuck is taking southwest so he probably  embraced the hundred dollars well they're number one in customer satisfaction every year i mean  they're amazing customers love them you don't have to have a fat fuck next to you that's wonderful  they uh i would fly southwest because they're cheap because they get for an hour two hour flight i won't 
[00:43:30]  fly first class to even continental i'll fly coast to florida i'm not paying a thousand dollars to fly  to florida i would you can it's comfy don't get me wrong seat here's the issue with with coach  in first i i think there should be curtains that curtain us so that when coach people if you want  to call them that get on they can't make eye contact i know i i hate that when they have to stop  in the aisle in first class because you know they're putting their bags in and then they just look at you 
[00:44:00]  it's like excuse me i'm trying to enjoy a cocktail here i'll actually say something move along  stop looking at me with your coach eyes  i love how they look at you like oh you don't deserve to be sitting there how can you afford  this yeah yeah they give me the looks like oh i know because i'm just a slob all the time  like give me that look it's great i want to just say sometimes because i really am ashamed because i 
[00:44:30]  really am you know yeah fucking my father's a truck driver from jersey i want to go look the  contractor standard networks everyone gets first class it's not special for me there is a  guilt thing when people are looking around and they're like they're in the taj mahal they're  just kind of like oh so this is first class yes keep moving right through it keep moving i actually  would just hold my cocktail up and laughed whimsically for no reason like i'll have a moment of whimsy  like when they when they're all piling on and the kids are crying i'll just hold my cocktail and go  cocktail i mean my uh tomato juice i have i have a cocktail in my hand a lot and usually if somebody 
[00:45:00]  makes eye contact i open my eyes up so my monocle falls out and i go i just moan did we do okay  with the kevin smith smartcast i think we were pretty clear about what happened yeah i'd rather  get kevin's yeah there's more audio maybe we'll do a little more later on i'd rather wait for kevin  to comment i think we might have messed up a little bit on that but why no i would rather hear kevin 
[00:45:30]  tell you kind of worked out in the end yeah he's very interesting you know it would have been much  better to have kevin on the show obviously the guy he spins a quite the yarn maybe he'll uh maybe  he'll call later today you never know he's a smart guy he's probably doing press uh a certain way  around or cop out which i think he's funny like like he he's in this embarrassing fucking situation  where for the most part all you'd want to do is get on and beat the shit out of the airline and  everything yet he you know tells the story where you kind of really i guess being a writer helps 
[00:46:00]  but he tells the story where it's entertaining and fun so i don't mind listening to his smartcast  like that to me that's that's fine man and he was fair with the airline too he he told it the way  it happened at least you sense he did it i would just be and this is where anger is a blocker to  being creative and funny i would just be like fuck damn they should hit a pole pole where a lot of  times there's poles in the middle of the fucking runway i thought you meant in the air no odd no  the tall pole well i fly they always fly low when i'm on the plane i request 50 feet or under 
[00:46:30]  there are many poles but that's what that you're right but he is a writer that's why he tells her  really spins an interesting yarn yeah i would get right to it and i panic when i tell a story  and i my my shame is just i can see all the eyes being averted so i rush to the end i'll be like i had  a thing on the airline and people's eyes go i go they throw me off i would cut everything out  and all the good parts out the setup and then i try to go back and retell it but since they already  know the end they lose interest i stink the end yes oh ah we got a oh huh hold on one second eh 
[00:47:00]  ahmad hey how's it going man good evening i i didn't know i didn't know i've been uh communicating  with the terrorists on twitter oh jeez well yeah yeah you actually ahmad ali holy shit i'm scared  this guy ahmad this guy ahmad can you wait it is a pain in the ass to travel to the states it is just

[00:49:00]  whatever it is you know yeah what's he supposed to do maybe take a lap around the uh i don't know do  something torch as a stick and slap shot how about how about show a sense of humor something i don't  know he made the eyes like what am i doing we'll get into that in some other olympic talk after the  break uh lots to do today and that we are the world thing needs a beating and we're gonna do just  that sometime this morning by the way speaking of southwest airlines i had a great bit on

[00:50:00]  i remember it it is pretty it not i was gonna say pretty good that's not that's like a backward  no it's not no it's very good uh yeah we are the world 25th anniversary we got to talk about that  family guy takes a shot at palin's kid fucking family guy rules although you know they could do  that because you're gonna get shit for palin so who cares all right who gives a crap  gives a crap no i said you're oh palin oh yeah palin sorry it's palin no you're right  it's palin i'm sorry i thought you meant uh that she was gonna give family guys shit 
[00:50:30]  no no oh yeah i don't think you know something no you're right i saw the clip  yeah yeah all right we'll get uh i'm just we're just stalling bit is six minutes fuck you jimmy  we're not doing a six minute fucking bit for you today but you know what it is a great bit so i  say fuck it go to itunes what else are you doing exactly by living being busy listen to this drivel  all right opie and anthony stay there  yeah uh jimmy's missing a little black sabbath we're going a little classic 
[00:51:00]  i saw a great movie last night what's it say a little documentary called  it might get loud a documentary and i know and i know sam saw it too and i didn't see the movie  because i saw you tweeting about it it was just a coincidence that you saw it might get loud  and i saw it might get loud so obviously sam watched it yeah tweeted about it so which 
[00:51:30]  wrestlers are in it there's no wrestlers in actually wrestlers why how but what was it  about wrestling it wasn't wrestling or wrestlers actually i'm very surprised that sam would see  a movie like that because it's about uh good old rock and roll it's a it's a documentary on the  guitar basically really and uh so who takes a guitar and smashes it over someone's head  that's what i was looking for now guitar got smashed i was like what why did you see this  movie sam jack white's in it oh you're a big jack white fan i'm a huge jack white fan i love the 
[00:52:00]  white stripes and that raconteur yeah the raconteur what movie it might get loud it might get loud it's  a movie on uh the guitar basically and it's three guys it's jack white it's uh the edge from you too  and it's uh the great jimmy page getting together oh wow and talking about the guitar  and uh wow and their careers and it was very very interesting for music lovers i mean the average 
[00:52:30]  uh joe i don't think would enjoy the movie because it goes it gets a little deep because they play  they start playing some of the records they really dug growing up and why what was that one song uh the  rumble holy shit was that song fucking good what is that could you find that never heard of it's a  find the live version the rumble who loved the rumble was it jimmy page yeah jimmy like all of  a sudden you're in jimmy page's house i would assume man and he pulls out a 45 and uh never  heard of this song before in my life i guess it's a it's a pretty important record and uh it's called 
[00:53:00]  uh the rumble i think by the artist i've never heard of before and jimmy page just puts it on and  he's just playing air guitar to it going listen to this man man and it was really i don't know it was  really cool because each one took turns kind of playing some of the some of the guitar licks that  they grew up listening to that influenced them yeah it was pretty cool jack white is a big bluesy guy  obviously really loves the the old school blues now where'd you see this uh movie are you going for 
[00:53:30]  a joke no it's on demand is it on demand okay because i was wondering because yeah i was going  through on demand i don't think even see it i don't think uh i don't think this movie was ever in  theaters to be honest with you yeah i don't remember seeing it promoted or nothing i was  really because last night i went through like every on demand movie on purpose because it was  shit on it and uh i didn't see it's a bit niche but it's a good fucking flick if you know the players  jimmy page and and and and they also do kind of like a jam session they all like share their 
[00:54:00]  favorite like uh guitar song that they've done yeah and then all of a sudden all three are like  going with it like oh cool this is all right jamming it was it was all right man how do you  go about getting those guys like what's the phone call hi jimmy page yeah i'm putting together a  movie i'm gonna try to get you and like the edge and stuff we're just gonna get together and hang  out and play guitar okay yeah it was the guy who did an inconvenient truth so he was all like they  were he was very buzzword liar pants on fire guy yeah i don't believe anything i saw liar movie yeah 
[00:54:30]  fuck that snowing constantly everywhere shut up as much as i love jack white he was in over his head  because you got you got the edge i mean his band has sold a few albums and and then you got jimmy  page jack white is well on his way of course yeah but he was in a bit over his head with those two  guys he was the younger generation yeah it was the younger then it was the guy getting a little  older and then it was the uh older statesman i gotcha and fucking seeing jimmy page because there's 
[00:55:00]  been rumors that he can't play anymore that's fucking bullshit he picked up a guitar like and  he still loves to play the guitar oh it is oh for some reason if you're like a legendary guitarist uh  age doesn't seem to affect you right like clapton can still pick up a guitar and fucking play clapton  and and and the edge admitted something because i mean townsend the edges stuff is very complicated  yeah and i i forgot what song he was doing but he goes you see this this riff or whatever and it's 
[00:55:30]  really complicated he goes i'll be honest with you he turns off the effects this is all it is  pling pling oh yeah yeah yeah it was very simple he goes but i can't bring this to uh bono and go i  got a new fucking lick for you but you throw it through the effects and then it's that u2 sound  that we all kind of yeah kind of know my brother has spent uh multitudes of cash on effects that the  edge uses to get that sound in uh to you but one of my cover i forgot what song it was but it was 
[00:56:00]  tribute but when you hear you got to see the movie because yeah i'll check it out the edge is like  yeah this is all it really is before you go through the effects funny like why would you admit that  jack white was being completely like how anti-technology he is and now he thinks it  hurts creativity and all this stuff he's building guitars out of coke bottles and and then the edge is  like yeah i don't do anything without effects that's what i love the movie starts with jack  white making an old school blues guitar with a yeah with a coke bottle and one string and he plugs it 
[00:56:30]  into an amp and then he's like this is all you really need and he's like fucking jamming on the  one string yeah and it sounds cool as hell that's fucked up and then what song did uh jimmy page share  with the gang uh what zeppelin song was a whole lot of love yeah yeah when jack white was watching him  do the intro all sudden jimmy it was jimmy page's uh turn he picks up the guitar and now  the edge and jack white are sitting on their couches and and he just starts riffing a whole lot of love  and what was cool because i mean the edge has had massive success jack white massive success but the 
[00:57:00]  smiles in their face you could tell they're like holy shit we're watching jimmy page just play  fucking a whole lot of love right in front of our eyes the guy uh dwayne eddie the rumble and then  uh link ray kevin from connecticut do we have that uh travis link ray yeah this is what jimmy  page really dug listen to this fucking just this riff this is from you know this pulp fiction yeah  oh they used it in pulp fiction oh yeah fuck all right you know what yeah  yes and sort of that fucking and coke logic saw the movie too i guess a lot of people saw the movie 
[00:57:30]  he said the song was elevation you know the riff in elevation yeah that's just a very simple  before you do the effect uh let's say hi to paul in jackson paul hey there paul  paul yeah we lost paul okay ah whatever i i hold on one second let's say hi to mike in philly mike 
[00:58:00]  hey what's up guys what's up um i gotta disagree up i think jack white was of all of them especially  the edge he was he was the purest true guitar player uh i mean jimmy was obviously a pioneer in in uh in  you know like rock guitar but the edge you kind of looked out of his league is more of like almost  like a tech weenie than than everybody else i think but jack white was kind of a geek guitar  player i was saying he was out of his league as far as looking at these two guys they've had  a lot more success than jack white has had so far i mean jack white is on his way i also watched the 
[00:58:30]  uh that's all i was getting at i mean yeah jack white could fucking he could keep up with them  without a doubt on the guitar i also watch this guy go ahead what finish up your thoughts sir  no i did i'm sorry you're probably you're probably right i mean but i just think i think jack might  have been i mean this is sacrilege to say as a guitar player myself but i think he's got an anthem  jimmy page man as far as like real guitar riffs and like knowing the guitar as an instrument jimmy  looked a little soft uh in the documentary i think personally jimmy page i just looked jimmy page 
[00:59:00]  looks like thomas jefferson yeah he's very looks like thomas jefferson gray yeah he's gray it is a  shocking white head of hair on him but he keeps in a ponytail because he's still rock and roll  thomas jefferson i love the movie i don't know for music fans i don't know if you've heard of this  one it might get loud you might want to check it out it's on demand right now on the dvd there's  also a bonus feature of a q a thing they did and everybody was confused because in the beginning 
[00:59:30]  of the movie it's like a documentary but jack white is supposedly teaching his nine-year-old self  yeah how to play guitar yeah because i wikipedia'd that because there's a miniature jack white i'm  like is that his son and now he's passing on his knowledge to his son and then i find out his his  kids are only like four years old so i'm like what the fuck's going on he explained that that was him  when he was nine yeah so so it starts with him like talking to he insisted it was him his nine-year-old  self yeah i i were just doing the part where he's playing a whole lot of love and the guys are 
[01:00:00]  just let's see the smiles they're like holy shit it's like that's the guy that did it  sustain on it and i and i and i i got him to come down and have a listen to it i said can you get  that nigel tuffnell little sustain he came back with this phenomenal thing got a lunch come back  you'll still be hearing that one distortion pedal which overloads yeah it gets it gets a little  too detailed probably but uh it's it's cool and then they did a little jam to in my time of dying 
[01:00:30]  which is just an amazing fucking song so i think anyone like it you should check it out check that  shit out anyway oh my god now they're showing old footage oh my god jesus christ is this page or the  guy he took the riff from oh this might be the this might be it yeah yeah you gotta hear this 
[01:01:00]  this is what i'm actually playing this is the edge  at least he's willing to admit it the rest is the foot pedal the effects the whole thing  you know so if you're on acoustics and i say here's my new riff it's really cool riff listen  that is funny  isn't that awesome gotta give him that who would admit that he came across as very charming in this 
[01:01:30]  movie yeah the edge is very charming he is no hold on let me ask linda stessie uh what else you  might have thought linda stessie fucking charming thank you aunt sam you're a mo he's very charming  did he have a sweet disposition seems like a nice young man let me say hi to uh rick and rocklin  rick good morning boys hey this movie is about innovation and uh i didn't see it but i saw the  clips and i saw jack white put that guitar together and it's pretty amazing yeah the thing about it is 
[01:02:00]  i don't think edge belongs because there are three guitar players at least that i recognize and the  problem with guitar playing now is that nobody sets the world on fire anymore because it's all been  done the three guys that come to my mind that change guitar and they're like holy crap what is  he doing hendrix van halen who came out in the height of disco and uh i guess the most big recent guy i  can think of is tom morello but what these guys what this movie is about is jimmy page obviously as  you guys have been over he's robbed black music and jack white they're both heavily influenced by the 
[01:02:30]  blues that's why i want to see this movie because i really want to know where edge fits in with that  besides the fact that he did a lot with well i i think i could answer your question i mean you're  going to put a movie together like this it might get loud so now you're you're thinking all right  who do we get maybe they couldn't get eddie van halen or somebody else so they wanted three  generations it's obvious you got page you got the edge you got jack white that that that's three  generations of guitar players right so maybe they did want someone maybe maybe other guys turned down 
[01:03:00]  the project i'm surprised jimmy page said yes to this they said these were their first three  choices oh really yeah okay you know they say those i have to i'm a huge fan of jack white and  everything he does because i really i mean his guitar playing is just ridiculous they must have  offered him potions because he's a warlock we don't know jimmy page yeah man well he lived in  alister crowley's house yes man he's a warlock they showed he's doing very interesting things 
[01:03:30]  because he's new to the past but he's taking a lot of stuff and doing putting a new face on it  all right sir thank you thank you another part of the movie that was cool they showed where um  they recorded when the levee breaks and like kind of like a castle yeah jimmy page walks into this  castle and it's it's just the vestibule with a staircase that goes up two or three stories i don't know  two or three floors and he goes yeah we we set up the drums right here i'm like that's where they 
[01:04:00]  did that great fucking song we set the drums up here because it was echoing nice and then we hung  the the microphone from the banister and that's how we got that just over the top loud fucking drum  sound for the song when the levee breaks i'm like god damn i love hearing that shit because you think  it's all in a studio yeah really figure it out and i always think it's kind of kooky when they um  when they just kind of go to some wacky place yeah we recorded this like we had we went to um  you know a laboratory and uh it was in the room with the rats that were being worked on it what 
[01:04:30]  like it inspired us the white stripes documentary comes out next month it's supposed to be really  good circus tent we just rented a circus tent and did you yeah we went into the sewer  yeah there's just a certain ambient echo you can't get in a studio in a sewer hey by the way uh the  rumble you said pulp fiction what scene because it's driving me nuts i know i know that whole sound 
[01:05:00]  is in the movie but is that the uh part where john travolta's shooting up um could you play that riff  again if you have it don't be fresh well isn't it when she walks to the bathroom yeah it's when  they're in the uh at the uh jack rabbit slim yeah that's one okay all right yeah because i as as i'm  listening to that last time like i know this song but yeah and then pulp fiction of course but now i  now i need to know what scene all right enough of that that was a great use of music and uh pulp 
[01:05:30]  fiction he brought a lot of that that music that sound to a lot of people's attention right yes oh  this dude's been waiting for a fucking half hour i'm sorry ahmad hey how's it going ahmad ali he's  calling from vancouver now what are you doing for the olympics how long but how long but how long  bah hi ahmad hey i'm a i'm a uh freelance reporter uh so i i'm al jazeera yeah who you're reporting 
[01:06:00]  for uh uh no i i report for a local system which is a sports radio station uh but i do uh i do also  work for uh the canadian press oh yeah right on man and al jazeera al jazeera is actually here though  hey by the way you were the one that uh floated the rumor that rush was going to be at the opening  ceremonies i look like a big fucking asshole on twitter no uh what what happened was we contacted  rush people and they said uh well we can't confirm and deny because of an nda we thought okay well if 
[01:06:30]  they signed an nda they got to be there so the rumor is now that they're going to actually go  show up at the um at the closing ceremonies and play an instrumental song instrumental by the way  for people who don't know an nda is an nda yes a lot of people don't know that well the opening  ceremonies they had to bring out all the canadian artists did you guys watch the opening ceremony  news fest did you watch any of it yeah all of it okay you did yeah i was wondering what ann murray was  up to holy shit canada just because just because ann murray's from canada doesn't mean you have to 
[01:07:00]  drag her into the whole opening ceremonies everybody how do you guys like katie lang katie lang oh she's  more manly than me yeah she's a she's a fat guy she couldn't fly southwest to canada i was watching  it with a bunch of canadians and as soon as she showed up everybody thought it was michael buble  because there was a room that he would be playing but every and we couldn't really tell  she's wearing a manly suit she's terrible of course she's she's a lesbian of course she's 
[01:07:30]  gonna wear the manly suit what was the i didn't hear this i only shot it at the comedy cellar so i  saw it on tv well who was the fucking the the white def jam poet or whatever oh that guy was  horrendous of course he was he became a star on youtube and it says poem about canada can we play  that canada we love you but jesus what a snooze fest they should have just wheeled out john candy  he would have been more interested or had michael j fox bumble with a hot cup of coffee it was just  a bunch of nonsense and then what enough with brian adams yeah another guy he's from canada good 
[01:08:00]  for you wow i never knew that i never heard that over the years oh no he is what about fucking  neil young what about fucking rush rush at the opening ceremonies would have been awesome neil  how about living in the limelight these guys are living in the limelight for the next two weeks  fucking you jam limelight instead of all this fucking depressing shit they were doing or how  about red barchetta because that's what that guy should have taken instead of the luge sled yes  at least he died doing what he loved right guys oh yeah he's being flung hitting a beam at 90 miles 
[01:08:30]  an hour i'm sure that's how he wanted to go exactly enough with this dying how the way he wanted i was  talking what he wanted i was talking to somebody about it and it's like you watch something like  that it's horrible but you realize that guy's family was watching at home oh here he comes here he  comes it comes around the uh turn and it's oh oh no good and then like by the end you just fast  forward if the neighbors are awkwardly leaving like yeah we gotta get up there's an uneaten cake 
[01:09:00]  with a luge on it on the dining room table oh shit oh my god wow oh but you forget that there's like  you watch something we're so used to like that it's like when you break down like what is happening  with the family and friends it's almost like when the challenger exploded yeah there are people  watching that who knew these people and it's like it's not just this event it's like there are  people who are like all right here he goes everybody be quiet yeah and then they watch  him wipe out and die it's like what do you do what happens is the strongest uh family member 
[01:09:30]  takes down all the party decorations the olympic rings yeah you find the strongest there's always  one in the family that nothing phases them everyone can be dying around them and they're strong so you  use them to take down the party decorations oh you think they like kind of like i don't know put  him in the coffin a little differently so it doesn't look like he was still doing the luge oh god  that is horrible you don't even gotta it's the same fucking playing the same way and maybe a lamb  on the side or something yeah propped up on his elbow he that guy had to set a record record for for 
[01:10:00]  for dying the quickest in the in the history of man that guy was dead like instantly when you smash  your head on that guy was fucking instantly dead and they said he was scared of that track too man  he said he did that one too yeah what was the quote i'll i will either win or die die well god damn it  what do you know on that ahmad ali from vancouver well the thing about that guy was the track was  actually created by a computer like they just kind of put in what would make the fastest track which is 
[01:10:30]  a great way to design a video game but when you're actually using athletes and stuff it gets kind of  scary and you had these american athletes were actually and canadian athletes were actually in  favor of it they wanted a lot the faster the faster one but some of these inexperienced especially from  the smaller countries they were like screw this we're gonna die on this yeah they were calling that  uh part in the course 50 50 for real yeah because only half the people were making it through i think  70 fucking people wasn't uh didn't make that that course like had some kind of a why the fuck 
[01:11:00]  problem they have like during uh preliminaries that was a tough part in the course why wouldn't  they have some like some some safety well that's what you do no you come out of a turn and then  you have a low wall uh that's open to cement stanchions yeah it's amazing it's uh they should just run  the luge you know you know when you go in a water park and everything is just in a tube yeah  everything's fine that's what it's going to become and no one's going to be able to see what the  fuck's going on you just see him come out the end like running man in the metal cage 
[01:11:30]  i think the luge is a waste of a sport oh it's pretty exciting to watch yeah but i mean does it  take any skill what is it it's all about the push off apparently it does no like like you if if you're  not if you're not hitting those curves in the right place because you can steer those things a  little bit so if you're not high up on a bank turn to go into the next turn you end up like that  guy and flip out right over the wall yeah it's yeah there's very few of them you could die skiing  you know i was impressed with i never saw before was that that ski where they go jump jump jump jump 
[01:12:00]  jump jump jump jump jump jump jump with like you know what i mean where they go all the way down  moguls is that what it's called left right left right jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump it's  it's it's is it the one where it's moguls and then they have to do a jump yeah it's like they're  going that's bizarre helicopter jump yeah and then they go back to  jump jump jump jump and like their upper body doesn't really move dude their legs are going  like shock absorbers what kind of arthritis they must have in their like knees that's what they say 
[01:12:30]  yeah oh really mogul skiers have like horrid uh knees and legs it starts off like  that's exactly what it is  jesus christ oh fuck tom green why the fuck are we talking to him today he's canadian oh just like  the olympics oh that one should have stayed in my head oops that'll work is he really coming in today 
[01:13:00]  yeah of course oh i'm very excited to talk to tom green what year is this jesus christ oh my god  i'm glad he's coming yo what do you got on the jump jump jump jump jump jump jump on the on the moguls  no you have nothing on that of course what else you got from the uh uh the winter olympics  uh well i just want yeah i want to talk about all the things i've gone wrong pretty much everything  that they've that everything's gone wrong that could have gone wrong starting with uh that the night  opening ceremonies when they had the uh the cauldron only three of the four arms i like one of the 
[01:13:30]  boners didn't come up yeah i like how anthony explains it uh we were supposed to be four boners  only three boners came up we got ripped off because we only got three erections instead of four and  they had a hard time getting uh getting them up there because uh they were standing around like  idiots he had the great one uh jackie gleason oh oh wayne gretzky i i heard the great one i thought  jackie gleason no had to come out is that plastic surgery or is he pissed off i can't figure it out  i'm looking at the picture he's aging and i love wayne gretzky i'm a big hockey fan so you can't 
[01:14:00]  really trash uh the great one he's angry he is fucking pissed he's standing there holding that  torch he was just supposed to go out there the boners come up he hits it the with the torch and he's  gone yeah and there he's standing there and he kind of made some eye moves like oh fuck come on  and why does why does gretzky got to share their moment with three other zeros who else was uh  part of the uh hey the paralympic guy steve nash what who steve nash he's an nba player i thought 
[01:14:30]  it was the cop that got his ear cut off that's marvin nash that was marvin his brother marvin  nash who are the other two ahmad katrina lemay doan was one of them she's a double gold medalist in  speed skinny for canada and gives a shit it's wayne gretzky you know what fucking wayne did  in his time nobody knows her no one knows her no one knows the guy that's who has no legs that work  and and and and yeah exactly nobody nobody steve nash should be you know fucking playing basketball 
[01:15:00]  somewhere it's a very canadian thing though to share it among four people rather than give of course  that's exactly with health care and everything all right who else yeah and the other person was  nancy green who was uh a skier in the 1968 olympic nobody thank you oh god nobody gives a shit  about nancy green not even our own family at this point the whole planet is what nobody cares about a  broad that went down a hill 42 years ago no one kidding me or 32 years ago and you know what i love 
[01:15:30]  the propaganda because uh ahmad is on to something here the winter olympics have been a complete disaster  so far but you wouldn't know that if you're watching the coverage they can't get fucking  snow it's raining it's too warm the the erection didn't work what else has gone wrong ahmad well the  whole loose thing the loose thing uh yeah you know they should have maybe had somebody from  my favorite olympics the 1936 olympics  why was that your favorite well well it was held in germany and hosted by well the man himself 
[01:16:00]  and he was humiliated by jesse owens oh yeah that got him a little angry and you saw what  happened later so again we can blame you know who for world war ii great humiliation  hey getting back to the loser by the way oh that's no way to talk about this guy he's just calling it  all what the fuck does we got to point out how ridiculous the media is again it was interesting 
[01:16:30]  how they lit the torch though in 1936 or we what how'd they light it it's terrible well of course  i think it was the bernstein family  all right oh and it's terrible i know it's a horrible joke he doesn't even hide it anymore  it was 1936 i used to love the subtle version of racist anthony now it's very long time ago  no the loser thing though i mean we got to point out that the media just sucks a dick because 
[01:17:00]  like where are their priorities at i i think you should show all this all this on tv but they're  showing this on tv and saying this is fine we could this is okay we should show this but uh nudity  uh uh the imus clip uh the janet jackson clip you know what i mean yeah what flew off of that guy  huh there's something i'm gonna guess his shoes flew off and his glasses he lost everything did  it was it i don't know because i saw something like he hit and something flew off it was probably 
[01:17:30]  his goggles or something just something that was a part of the sport uh steve from bay show that was  his soul being ejected jesus that is horrible going to a newborn somewhere oh uh yeah but they they  showed that all over tv but now i guess they're banning the clip finally now that we've all seen  it yeah why are they banning it and why is that okay why is that okay but other things are not okay  to show on tv i don't get it i don't know it's the same old argument i understand but they rationalized 
[01:18:00]  it because i heard some debates about this they said that it was news so they showed it but instead of  showing it over and over again like you won't see that as the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat  clip um but they they showed it as news but now they won't just pander with it see right there he's  still kind of going like i think i could pull this out hold on is that that was his arms like he was  flying right go back a little bit we're watching his slow motion as he gets go go frame by frame he 
[01:18:30]  hits the he hits the beam with the back of his head right yeah he wow that launched he's still alive  right there yeah right there like it's weird to watch somebody like a tenth of a second yeah yeah he is  dead and then his head hits he's coming backwards and i think it hits now he's still  he hasn't hit anything yet are they gonna uh come out with what killed him he hits a bench  it looks like a bench it was blunt force trauma obviously but i mean did it snap his spine did it  fucking almost decapitate him like you know what i mean and he stopped immediately which is never 
[01:19:00]  good the body absorbing that much energy like if he tumbled and rolled uh and didn't hit so many  like such a a strong thing like a concrete column but he's like boom he stopped that's all that energy  stopping in a split second do you know what i wonder when you're talking about that and this is off the  subject but many times that we watched 9 11 footage and you're in a jet and those planes are going about  550 to 600 miles an hour and then you hit the building and stop i mean stop yeah how did they die from 
[01:19:30]  the explosion or did people literally get pancaked in a millisecond like like to be stopped just  chewed apart like metal aluminum fucking cement whatever else is going through that that fuselage  that's just yeah instant that's it is instant you gotta give them that boy that that is a quick one  blunt force killed all those people way before yeah he was like that guy right there was like 
[01:20:00]  holy shit i'm losing it on the that's it and that's it that was it holy shit i just yeah  done that's it and then you're like what is this done oh fuck i'm dead oh well oh shit he uh  he came in dead last so uh see now that isn't he that that um i'm offended he came in dead last so yes  you know this they told this guy you're gonna lose lose the event uh ahmad what else you got on the 
[01:20:30]  opening ceremonies the olympics in general well the opening opening ceremonies i think what happened  was gretzky he was trucked down on the back of a pickup of all things to uh down to the waterfront  area and that's right by the ocean so you got this cold air coming in and this rain blowing in his face  and that's why he looks so pissed off i don't think he was happy to be there happy to be here now  well they think he's like this you know they think he's like a good canadian farm boy but he's been 
[01:21:00]  an american millionaire for the last 25 years you know he's probably thinking at that point you know  i don't need this shit yeah like they probably really ought to talk him into doing it and everything  and then he gets there and the fucking machine doesn't work and stuff canada's silly that's why  we're here with patriot missiles and all kinds of fun stuff just stop  i could be on my estate in phoenix stick to your asian stick to your asian titty bars in canada  and your fucking snow cats we've got plenty of yeah plenty plenty of both but well the snow cats 
[01:21:30]  we're actually having problem with the snow there's no snow here in vancouver yeah it's all rain and  they said it was they said it was colder in dallas when the olympics started global warming it's actually  a warm place believe it or not the people think canada they think it's all ice but it's actually kind  of a warm place out here um i hope it's actually nicer there when i'm shooting a  film there in may whoa not a long story so uh well how what's the temperature there are you  really it's an independent it's vancouver though yeah god damn that's cool what's the uh what's the 
[01:22:00]  um temperature there now uh it's about well about seven or eight degrees celsius i'm not sure how that  translates over to the other celsius you're not sure what it is in degrees oh no that's what it is in  degrees that's not what it is that's degrees celsius yes no i'm talking about like we want  fahrenheit give us we're in america we don't celsius is for queer celsius i don't know what can't even  say it yeah celsius celsius yeah i was thinking about that i was i was about to describe something 
[01:22:30]  in meters earlier too meters it's a canadian we need an american to do our olympic updates the hell  and we had and the guy who read the 44 degrees fahrenheit you want the poem guy yeah because i  didn't this thing was horrendous they apparently why why they pull the clips they don't i don't know  when they put on a dvd probably it's 105 degrees there no i i was trying to convert no 144 is the  converted celsius why you're converting from 44.6 you know oh my god it's hot 
[01:23:00]  uh all right i'm on i think we're i think we're gonna let you go we want to listen to this canadian  poem oh the other the other story it's it's it's it's women's hockey but still the canadian team is  showing no mercy and i fucking love that yeah they beat uh who do they beat 18 to zip they beat  slovakia 18 to zip and then they beat um they beat another team 10 to one yeah 10-1 last night the 
[01:23:30]  canadian women's hockey team is they're like fuck sportsmanship fuck fuck everybody we're going to  score as many goals as possible and i love that the rules are different for women's hockey when you  you could carry the puck in your cunt because men can't do that spit it out  conjured up a fun image it reminds i could i just picture a horse dripping a hockey puck out of his  mouth and all the horse saliva that would be on the puck how it would stink up the ice 
[01:24:00]  steven has from basher goes ahmad's favorite show was 1.73 meters under  that's that's a good little joke exactly that's a nice little joke right there ahmad  weights and measurement jokes very funny very good as good as avionic jokes yes i prefer avionic  jokes if you wouldn't truth who wouldn't uh yeah but i mean you guys digging this  fucking 18 to zip thing because they could hold back they didn't have to fucking you know make it 
[01:24:30]  hurt but they're making it hurt and i like that make it hurt it helps out next time intimidation  factor by the way uh they have to play again so when you do that you intimidate the next team you  play it helps you of course in the fucking uh olympics of course you want to be that guy  enough with everyone gets a trophy enough that everyone gets to play enough with mercy rules this  is how it should be destroy no matter how old you are playing a sport did you guys see the 
[01:25:00]  speed skating last night they got delayed three hours why did you get delayed because they ordered  they wanted to be environmentally friendly and call it the green olympics so they ordered all electric  zimbonis instead of the gasoline powered ones and of course electric vehicles don't work very well  and so they all crapped out and they couldn't clean the ice so for three hours that's brilliant enough  with this green shit i love this this green they had a fly in a zamboni that's good so now the 
[01:25:30]  plane and the zamboni and a propane power green my i'm hearing something in the mod and i want  officially because i think he's going to do some updates as the olympics continue i want to start  calling you the canadian roland oh really i hear a little rolling in them a little rolling  um probably in the looks department but i don't know about this i don't know just how you present  your material material you kind of sound like rolling too oh so they had a where do they fly  the zambonian from they fly they fly the zambonian from calgary which is about an hour flight away 
[01:26:00]  but because there's only one other speed skating ring zamboni around yeah but it's a special  zamboni why wouldn't you have it there yeah you what else is happening in the olympics because  have the fucking zamboni there they don't want to use any propane or gas i get it have it there  as an emergency just in case they fuck up which they did oh everything is fucking flopping there  it's it's warm their shitty zambonis are no good the fucking didn't work yeah the wayne gretzky is  standing there with nothing but his dick in his hand yeah hey i saw the i saw the opening ceremonies 
[01:26:30]  and there's one broad from iran i think in the winter olympics and she had the she had the shit on  are you kidding me whatever it's called burka burka i don't know what it was is she gonna ski  like that with a burka on she does ski like that she skis like that yeah and they got a sprinter who  sprinted like that in the summer you know what you know what maybe for just a fucking event they  could allow the woman not to wear the burka it might get in the way with sticks if uh she she doesn't 
[01:27:00]  wear it might get in the way as she's skiing down the hill all that good all those flowing robes  flying into her face as she's trying to get a good time enough with them they actually designed  one for skiing oh did they yeah aerodynamic aerodynamic burka yeah that's funny all right  so we got a zamboni they had to fly in we got uh all right yeah and yeah the the biggest the  biggest boom here the only people really benefiting right now oh don't talk about people like that  oh what i said that's the only people really benefiting from this other prostitutes um some 
[01:27:30]  of them are charging the vip rates up to ten thousand dollars an hour wow are they banging are they  banging olympians um they they say that it's mostly the officials and the coaches and uh we interviewed  one from uh from this place um which is kind of like the vip place in canada and they say the germans  are the biggest uh really yeah germans and british and they they distributed a hundred thousand 
[01:28:00]  condoms for free to all these athletes because apparently the athletes village is one giant orgy  know why it's one giant orgy most of these athletes know they don't even have a chance at a medal so  they're like you know what we're gonna fucking party have a good time get laid and then i'll and  then i'll do my best down the hill use your little bit of fame that you have as an olympian right  to buy a hooker yeah no the coaches are getting the hookers oh here was the big story though the uh  chinese uh couple the chick came out of retirement and um uh just nailed it if you listen to the 
[01:28:30]  announcer uh that was that was calling their routine he like the guy flips her around and she spins and  and just nails the landing and he made it sound like a super bowl interception running back for  a touchdown yeah because that's he was like just that's the same thing oh my god can we get that  clip like freaking out at uh of a fruity gentleman throwing a lightweight uh asian woman on a skate 
[01:29:00]  as soon as i saw i was figure skating night i went right to msnbc man yeah that's where all the real  shit's going on really well it was it was women's hockey but that's way better than the  fucking figure skating bullshit who could sit through that uh yeah and they say it's the most  popular that's the most popular event every every olympics right people love it with the girls with  the little skirts though that's why that's what it is i guess it's like uh gymnastics so women's 
[01:29:30]  gymnastics is the big one in uh in uh the summer olympics you get to see eight-year-olds in skirts i  i want to see like the downhill and all that shit yeah and thank you brian williams for telling me  who won the downhill before it fucking aired oh are they doing that now too idiots and i wasn't  paying attention when he said you know turn down your fucking tv because i was in the kitchen or  something i come out and they're like oh bode miller won the bronze thank you brian williams thank  you oh i didn't know i have a dvr what at this point it's too late if i watched it right now i would 
[01:30:00]  have forgotten that name hey bode miller never heard of him ahmad you done yes i just want to  say that jimmy when you come here in may you got to do some stand-up your book was sold out everywhere  around here i couldn't find it thank you that means they probably didn't carry it no they did carry it  okay carry it i had to special order it hey ah thanks ahmad you did pretty good so when you got a  you know some material built up you call again all right call back at 11 that was a good job  all right ahmad ali from vancouver trying him out he contacted me on twitter not bad

[01:32:00]  it's horrendous the olympics to me stinks so i have no interest why does it stink jimmy it's boring i  don't care about i could care less i i honestly could care less what's boring is they spend so much time  on just everybody qualifying for the finals i just want to see the finals yeah so they should  organize it better where you're just seeing the finals every fucking night not not qualifying heats  over and over again where they're slowing down at the last second because they're saving it for the  finals i just want to see the finals i'm not i don't care about these people enough to see them you

[01:36:30]  goomy oh whatever lucky i got most of it right m and what's the difference exactly actually a big  one if it's with your daughter all right define canada you might say the home of the rocket or the  great one who inspired little number nines and little number 99 but we're more than just hockey  and fishing lines off the rocky coast of the maritimes and some say what defines us is something  as simple as please and thank you and as for your welcome well we say that too but we are more than  genteel or civilized we are an idea in the process of being realized we are young we are culture strung 
[01:37:00]  together then woven into a tapestry and the design is what makes us more than the sum totals of our history  we are an experiment going right for a change with influences that range from a to z and yes we say z  instead of z we are the colors of chinatown the coffee of little italy we dream so big that there  are those who would call our ambition in industry because we are vineyards of good year after good  year we reforced what we clear because we believe in generations beyond because we were here to  fucking back you up why don't we turn this off for a second you fat motherfucker why are you yelling at 
[01:37:30]  him because he's making canada sound all fucking great and meanwhile canada would have been  fucking goose-stepping german or would have been fucking a russian just stop already about how  great you are we have little italy and chinatown too before you how do you know i just i have a  mic in front of me how do you know i know and this guy's neck is wobbling back and forth like a  fucking like a trout is in there he looks like he just scooped up a trout he looks different can we 
[01:38:00]  see a photo of at least from the olympics because here he's like fucking dumpy but he tries to hip it up  for the olympics he is trying to hip it up he moves his hands a lot like a beatnik he's like  moving his hands in circular like he's gesticulating in a circular motion i guess that's the way these  kind of poets do it to keep their timing whatever he's by that water so he could get a little krill  when he's done because he's fat it's a whale i love how mad and gets this is a fat guy proud of 
[01:38:30]  canada it's part of his nation die you fat pig don't be proud all right it's a country that that  thank thank christ you share an entire fucking continental border with the united states or  you'd be fucked on on a on on a stick or something did they now he's got a a beret on is that a beret or  his hair what is that did they throw him into the cauldron after he read his poem to fuel the fire  render his fat down right yeah he looks like shea blabera with his hat and beard we don't need to 
[01:39:00]  hear more about is it a poem yes we hear a little more this is pretty moving i'm actually yeah i'm  actually getting into it he's dressed in by the way the canon thing with the vest that's better than the  lost vests this year we'll talk about that after those fucking plan of the apes costumes boy if i had  enough with lost ambition in industry because we are vineyards of good year after good year we 
[01:39:30]  hold on pause he's only saying that he's saying good year after good year just because he gets to  see every super bowl with that product written across his stomach because he's a blimp yeah he's fat  vineyards of good year after good year we reforced what we clear because we believe in generations  beyond our own knowing now that so many of us have grown past what we used to be we can stand  here today filled with all the hope people have when they say things like someday because we are  more than a laundry list of things to do and place to see more than hills to ski and countryside ponds to 
[01:40:00]  skate we are the abandoned hesitation of all those who can't wait we are first rate greasy spoon diners  and healthy living cafes a country that is all the ways you choose to live a nation that can give you  variety because we are choices we are millions upon millions of voices shouting keep exploring  we are more we are the surprise the world has in store for you it's true canada is the what in  what's new so don't let your luggage define your travels each life unravels differently and experiences  or what make of the colors of our tapestry we are the true north strong and free and what's 
[01:40:30]  more is that we didn't just say it we made it be i don't care i don't care if my jokes don't go over i  don't care i'll go home and get your fucking shine box does dom de louise have a comment for him  okay what's next exactly that was rough during the opening ceremonies i like we could have had rush  doing something i liked his uh second speech which didn't get quite as much uh play all right it's easy 
[01:41:00]  to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat this is hard the man worthwhile  is the man who can smile when his shorts aren't too tight in the seat  okay pookie see that's american poetry there you go there you go  i like a poem that just goes simple and it's a poem yeah roses are red violets are blue i live in 
[01:41:30]  canada and you're here too see that would have been fine yeah but it clapped yes we are we are the  new the thing the light of the shines in the north and the thing why what are you we are everything  except interesting celebrities during the opening ceremony that's right we don't shave so our  genitals are furry ladies and gentlemen say hello to ann murray  ann fucking murray jesus gave us ann fucking murray are you kidding me you know what we could give

[01:42:30]  no rush though man i'm gonna pump that shit up a little bit they probably weren't asked  i bet that it's all rumor why don't we uh do this nancy elliott clip because this is just  terrific oh this fucking bitch she is awful what a wretched awful woman you know something  everyone has their uh uh right to their opinions agreed sexuality and i agree with hers wholeheartedly  asshole heartedly no but she's you hear this fucking pig talking about she's talking about 
[01:43:00]  like she's basically just against gay marriage and against same-sex marriage i think yeah but the way  she's describing anal sex like would i allow that it's like what a horrible fuck she must be jesus  what a horrible fuck this woman must be have you ever been on some of these porn sites i think  she's absolutely right do you see what gets pulled out it ain't a plum on jack's rat's  or whatever it was well she's not she's not being literal i mean i mean she wants to be literal  about it why not describe oral sex the same way yeah nice spit yeah exactly yeah fluid you're taking a

[01:44:00]  while you know what were we talking about and so i started thinking and we're talking about taking  the penis of one man and putting it in the rectum of another man and wiggling it around in excrement and  you have to think i'm not sure would i allow that to be done to me all of us that could happen to  you would you let that happen to you is that normal this fucking fat ugly she looks like a

[01:50:00]  fucking this is a great place for a stick up and it has a clit attachment  heavy flow and she put lol there's nothing lol about that  not infirmity infirmity i don't know which and then she said the second choice always ultra thin  long super oh god now we're just trying to figure it out why there's heavy fall  there's look at this there's so many to choose from it's just kotex overnight heavy flow 
[01:50:30]  which is duct tape  and now i i stopped the video just for jimmy you see this fucking guy yeah it was pointed out to me  and i appreciate the person that pointed this out when they saw this video he's uh he's uh in-store  security doing fake shopping and and he needed to find out what the fuck we were doing as the video  continues you'll see that he gets right in our face making believe he's just happens to be in the  same section you didn't notice him no but maybe he just wanted to see what we were filming because  he was curious no he he wanted to make sure we were oh not up to any uh shenanigans shenanigans 
[01:51:00]  you want a 16 or 32 how do you think i wish there was a two-pack that's all she'd need but how  about this that's good that's a giant box jimmy yeah  get jimmy over here me again tell him what we found james good massage oil  we got vagisil we got vaginal anti-fungal cream

[01:53:00]  doesn't get a teddy bear you're gonna ruin my valentine's day by believing all of those sheets  you're not getting you're not getting rewarded for that we made the wrong choice  well it depends what kind of female you don't use these though come on  why don't you use these because i don't they're uncomfortable you said  yes this is what she told me to get i never bought these she's spanish she's always pregnant  she doesn't need a mission accomplished 
[01:53:30]  what are you thinking about anything nothing you're right all right security guy yeah  right box check out the video it's pretty good yeah on youtube my my horrible lower part of my  face i'm okay from the top of the nose up but like when you look at my face just like like an iron  just narrows and flab what an ugly motherfucker what an ugly motherfucker oh it's that's fine  people love you why don't we relate to being ugly you guys want to do the we are the world or 
[01:54:00]  you want to take a quick break i want to hear we are the world a little bit because i haven't  heard it i have not listened to it no a little bit it goes on for about  nine minutes all right why don't we get the we are the world video um most of us have heard the  song by now and they were ranting and raving how great this song came out it's a bit secret until  the big debut it's dog shit it really is dog shit and i think these uh celebrities are so out of  touch in hollywood that they no one stepped up and said you know this really is awful yeah i know  it's for a good cause and they're raising a lot of money but the song itself is really bad they let um 
[01:54:30]  um they let the little kids start it off justin bieber justin bieber because uh that would have  been michael's uh wish to uh have him have him in his bad point yeah sucking on his little hairless  wee wee that's what michael would have loved to be doing to him so that was uh that was a a nice  haunting tribute that was a good tribute and michael being in the video himself and them using his  background vocals that was shocking and the part of the video from the original we are the world 
[01:55:00]  when he was uh still when you looked at him and people used to goof like wow look how white he is  and meanwhile he was still kind of black yeah yeah fascinating he was going to get a lot whiter  after that oh yeah and his and his sister singing along with him that was a nice touch yeah doing  that whole nat king cole natalie cole yeah that was really and that can call over here that was  really yeah yeah yeah all right let's play this and we're gonna stop it a lot and then the song  just goes somewhere else it becomes another song and then there's screaming and yelling which which 
[01:55:30]  scared whitey there's a part of this song that scared whitey and i'll point it out yeah yeah let's  uh let's uh let's go through this maybe you could point out some of the celebrities too because i don't  know half these fucking people yeah yeah that's a good idea sam you're good you're good at that why  couldn't they that's an old man with a hat you're good at knowing shitty singers so celebrities why  couldn't they just do the original song just word for word with new people i don't know that would  have been good enough what's happening i don't know there's a sign that says press escape to exit 
[01:56:00]  that sounds like such a girl is not a girl no that's that little boy that's a guy that's a  little that's justin bieber who the fuck is justin bieber he's only who the fuck is warren jerome  justin bieber's only one of the most famous people in the country right now never heard of  what i don't know see justin bieber one less lovely girl is he popular very popular  pussycat doll and jennifer hudson i know those two

[01:57:00]  the song is passable it's fine yeah it really is it's a remake of the original it's passable and  they should have just continued down this road just remake it exactly with just new fucking  you know uh singers yeah all right continue here it comes here's michael  there's michael from the originals hand in his pocket  that must have been she's singing with him yeah that must have been a moment for her 
[01:57:30]  oh this part of the ship babs are you it's true we'll make a better day  better just you and me just you and me sound like a man at the end of her part  better day who's that that's miley sire of course it is  so they know that someone cares so they're crying 
[01:58:00]  who's that it's enrique iglesias  we got that thing removed  stop this i don't remember the song sounding like this now  now they've decided to go off the highway  they're gonna start now they're gonna start off-roading who was that was that streisand  again no streisand only had that one part maybe i'm not sure okay  selene yeah selene had a big part they gave  they gave jennifer hudson a lot of fucking time and selene had the big 
[01:58:30]  fucking over the top one's got the big range so they gave her the high high part and and  during the whole thing they intersperse it with clips of uh haiti little haitian children that are  suffering uh that are they look well dressed well fed i don't know what there was a major  earthquake i heard i heard about that i'm just saying you know they're not showing as much  suffering as they probably should at least they got nice weather we're freezing our asses off here  in the northeast it's probably colder there than fucking vancouver you know it's  for the show i held the winter olympics stupid vancouver boo hey

[02:14:00]  That was Kanye West.  His first appearance since the awards.  Yeah, good for him.  Maybe you should stop dancing and fucking build a house.  Well, then sing it.  Just sing it.  Just sing it.  They could pay for many houses with this song. 
[02:14:30]  Oh my God, that's what's dangerous.  These children standing on a big tall wall.  Jeff Bridges.  They didn't put a mic in front of his face, though.  He was there for show because he's up for an Oscar.  I didn't know the Colts won the Super Bowl.  Isn't that that shirt?  No, see.  I saw a shirt.  Charity.  That was charity.  Kevin in New York has something on this. 
[02:15:00]  Kevin.  How's it going?  Good.  JT was quoted as saying that they should never have remade this song.  This is like another artist doing a thrower or something.  It's a swell song.  It's totally untouchable.  Who said they shouldn't have remade it?  Jigga.  Jigga.  What?  It's J to the Z.  Jigga, I said.  Is that what they call him?  Jigga.  Jay-Z?  Yeah, Jay-Z.  They shouldn't have remade it?  The great Jay-Z.  He said he respects what they did with it.  Was he invited?  I'm sure he was invited.  Why?  He doesn't believe in charity and hating this Jay-Z? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, what is he talking about?  He does nothing but remake songs.  Yeah.  He just thinks that that is a song that's untouchable.  That's not untouchable.  He thinks they shouldn't have remade it.  Really?  Wait until he hears our version.  Oh, boy.  He will be offended.  I bet you.  I have a big A, Patty.  It's not a sacred song.  It's a good song.  Sandy Kane.  And I bet you Alphaville would say that our song is untouchable.  Alphaville doesn't know what they're talking about, though.  The latest Jay-Z song, Forever Whatever, is a fucking Alphaville song.  Young Forever.  No, it's Forever Young.  He even changes the fucking name on it.  It's Young Forever.  Here's the choice we'll make again. 
[02:16:00]  We're saving our own life.  Remember that?  Yeah.  That was the fucking auto-tune part in this one.  No way.  Weezy was there.  Weezy is the new Bob Dylan.  I'm not feeling it, yo.  They didn't have to put a little you-know-what in it.  What?  They didn't have to black it up.  Yeah, they really didn't.  They should have just done the original song and just have new people playing the parts.  Well, it was black people that needed the money from Haiti.  Although the original one, it was black people.  This is representative of what's popular. 
[02:16:30]  You can't-  The original one was contemporary.  Yeah, this is-  So is this one.  Yeah.  Can't say America doesn't write songs for black people.  What?  To help black people around the globe.  We're not like, you know, writing a song for like, you know, Sweden.  You never see like a Sweden tragedy where we have to do a We Are The World, We Are The Little  Swedish Children.  That's true.  It doesn't happen.  It hasn't come up.  It's always some, you know, kind of problem we got to deal with.  Hey, uh, natural disasters. 
[02:17:00]  Bill and Phoenix has a great idea for our radio show.  Oh, man.  Go ahead, Bill.  I did it longer.  How about, instead of Rock Scream, how about Jungle Scream?  And Anthony, you can do your part.  I am not doing it.  We Are The World down at-  What?  Jungle Scream Tuesday?  Doesn't seem like it's a great idea at all.  If I never hear the term Rock Scream again, I'll fucking, it'll be too soon.  What's wrong with the Rock Scream?  Everything.  It'll be fucking terrible.  That reminds me of a shitty-  Oh, shut up!  That reminds me of a fucking horrendous time on this show. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  We had to do that fucking filler shit because we were afraid of getting fired when we were  off XM.  Holy shit, do I fucking hate-  Hey!  Hey, how are you, Frank?  Let's hear it.  Hey, thanks for calling, Frank.  Holy shit, was that miserable.  We goofed on.  It was terrible.  Hey, uh, hey, uh, hey, uh, Arnold, you're on-  Hey, were you ever in a band?  No, man, but I sang a little bit.  Hey, far away, call from, call Fred, how are you? 
[02:18:00]  Hey, I'm calling from, hey, thanks a lot, Fred.  Holy shit, because we couldn't be edgy on that fucking faggot platform.  You are absolutely right.  Holy shit.  Hey, lookit, I have ears Thursday.  Oh, no.  Everybody's calling in except the poor burn victims.  They wait until Friday when it's friendless Friday.  When it's no vinegar Friday.  What about car door is a jar Thursday?  That was a good one.  Holy shit.  Car door is a jar Thursday. 
[02:18:30]  That fucking rock stream.  It was really, it was like, it was like, it was like going home and somebody was fucking  my woman every night and I had to just take it.  Yeah.  That was fucking terrible.  You didn't like it?  I hated that.  I can't describe to you because of what it was.  We had to do something to fill because we were paranoid about getting fired and our careers  being over.  Yes.  Fucking horrible.  As well.  We should have been.  Of course we should have been.  We were fucking off XM because of that fucking dummy that used to run it. 
[02:19:00]  The board wanted to fire us because a black guy made fucking jokes about fucking Condoleezza  Rice and Laura Bush and the Queen of England.  Yep.  Yes.  That's fucking annoying.  Holy shit.  Was that aggravating?  Can we play the Homeless Charlie clip again?  Why are we not playing that?  Why am I yelling?  I'm sorry.  Why don't we play that clip again?  What the fuck are we not playing Homeless Charlie for?  Yeah, we should.  He was great.  They're going to throw us off satellite for playing a black guy who was making jokes about  fucking the Queen of England and Laura Bush? 
[02:19:30]  Let's play it tomorrow or later today and go through it.  Fuck.  We never officially went through that audio.  No, I'd like to hear it again.  Knocked off the radio again for good.  All right.  Wow.  That's great, Jimmy.  But you started Cat Noises, remember?  But that was adorable.  Who did?  What's cuter than Meow?  What was it?  Cat Noise Tuesday or fucking...  Well, that was kind of a sarcastic rebuttal to Rock Scream.  Meow Cat Wednesday.  I don't know.  I hated Rock Scream. 
[02:20:00]  Because it would be Tuesday.  It'd be like, oh, good.  They're all going to call in and go...  So you give that We Are the World a passing grade?  Absolutely.  The song is like seven fucking...  Over seven minutes long.  It's not...  It is what it is.  It's just supposed to be, like Sam said, contemporary.  And it is contemporary.  And it's got everybody or a lot of the relevant people in it.  And you know what?  Rap is very...  It wasn't overpowered by rap.  I'll say that.  People are downloading the song to help out Haiti.  Yeah.  But are they actually listening to the song more than once?  Are you actually throwing that in your iPod and going, you know what? 
[02:20:30]  I got to put this on.  No less than the original, I don't think.  The original wasn't great.  The original...  The original got so much airplay, man.  It really did.  If you remember...  This song isn't going to get airplay from fucking radio stations, I would bet.  Radio stations played the fuck out of the first one.  They sure did.  They sure did.  Stick around.  In ten minutes, we're going to be playing We Are the World.  But also, don't forget, the airplay back then was different.  There wasn't automatic...  Every citizen didn't automatically have it five minutes after it was recorded.  I didn't say that, but I don't think people are playing it wherever they... 
[02:21:00]  I don't know.  Listen to music, whatever.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  It's Black History Month, and we're going to...  Oh, still?  We're going to feature somebody right now.  Tom Green?  Yes.  We'll be on the show soon?  Tom Green is in black.  Oh, you said we're going to be featuring someone, and then you said Tom Green.  Yes.  Yeah.  He's not black.  Pumpsy Green.  Pumpsy Green, I think we featured.  But, yeah, we did.  We got a good one for today.  Ooh.  Today's Black History Month tribute.  Tribute.  Tribute, sure. 
[02:21:30]  Hey, we got to say hi to Tom Green in studio.  TomGreen.  All right.  Dot com.  All right.  How's it going?  Oh, my God.  This is exciting.  We've talked to you a few times on the phone over the years.  Yeah, here we are.  Not a while, but first time live in studio.  Pretty cool.  This is exciting.  Thanks for having me on.  This is great.  We were talking about his TomGreen.com.  Right.  And the fact that he does a show on there from his living room.  I built a TV studio in my living room.  Yeah, you just built a TV studio in your living room. 
[02:22:00]  Did it start out like you saying, I want to build a TV studio in my living room, or just  grab a camera and a mic, and then you kind of got out of control buying shit?  You know what?  I've had this website for a long time.  I've had it since, it's been up since 1996, the website.  It's like the first website ever.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  But you couldn't do the video until maybe three or four years ago, maybe.  Yeah.  And as soon as that happened, I thought, wow, that's pretty cool. 
[02:22:30]  And I started putting them up in my blog at first, and I thought, you know, it'd be cool  to run a multi-camera through a switcher.  That's kind of how I started out in Canada.  I started doing my show on a public access station, and I took television and radio broadcasting,  so I kind of have a little bit of that techie bug in me, and I thought, you know, I could  put a switcher in here, we could run it all through here, and we did it.  A couple of cameras through that.  You got like a director that runs everything, you do it yourself?  Pretty much, yeah.  One guy comes in, and he'll sit in the corner.  We built the control room, it's just in the corner of the living room. 
[02:23:00]  And he sits there, and he runs up and has to adjust all the cameras as we go and stuff.  Yeah.  It's been going great, though.  We've had so many great guests, and lots of cool people.  Yeah, how do you get guests, like, to just go, hey, come over to my house, and is that  pretty much it?  You just...  Yeah, I mean, yeah, basically, I mean, we've had a talent booker working for the show at  periods when we do it nightly.  We would love one of those.  Wow, really?  We actually had a little budget for a while, not...  They say we have a talent booker.  I don't know.  I don't know if we really do.  Yeah, so we'd call everybody up, and then people would come do it, and it's been going 
[02:23:30]  good.  I've seen some Dice clips that were funny when you had Dice on.  Yeah, exactly.  He loves you.  The cool thing about doing the show is I didn't know Dice before he came and did the show.  Now Dice and I are friends, and he's come to the show.  Do you get the middle-of-the-night phone calls?  Yeah, sometimes.  I call him, too, though.  Where it's like three hours at Dice, and you get to talk for five minutes?  We give each other middle-of-the-night calls.  We've been through that, Tom.  I like the fact that Dice gave me marital advice, or advice on my divorce, before he 
[02:24:00]  got his, which was kind of funny now in hindsight.  He just got married.  I know.  Did he get married again?  Why would he just do that?  Did he have a big wedding?  Yeah, he just got married in Vegas.  Oh, Vegas.  I was invited.  I couldn't go.  I've been on tour.  I'm doing a world tour.  I'm doing a world tour right now.  I'm doing my first ever stand-up comedy tour.  Jim.  I was actually surprised to see, it said that you had started stand-up.  I didn't know you did, you're doing comics.  It's February 18th through 20th.  It's a great club here in New York.  It's in like the Meatpacking District on like 14th Street and 9th. 
[02:24:30]  And you can go to Comics New York.  It's spelled C-O-M-I-X-N-Y dot com.  I didn't know you did stand-up.  Yeah, it's, I'm just sort of really jumping into it now.  I mean, I did it when I was a teenager.  I don't know if, I did it for a couple of years when I was in high school.  And then I went back to, you know, took broadcasting, started my public access show,  never did it again, and I've been sort of itching to do it.  And about a year ago, I started jumping up in L.A. at the Comet.  How was it going up as a famous guy? 
[02:25:00]  And like, okay, all of a sudden they expect something from you because you're Tom Green  and they all know who you are.  And having to kind of break in that, it's easier to break in when you're a nobody  because nobody expects anything of you.  Yeah, I was a little, I was nervous about it at first.  Maybe that's why I procrastinated the last five years to actually get up and do it  because I've been meaning to do it.  And then the first night I jumped up at the comedy story, really, I think it kind of helped,  you know, as people kind of were yelling out scenes from Freddie Got Fingered  and stuff like this.  And, you know, I had them, you know, I wasn't sure if I'd have the audience out of the gate. 
[02:25:30]  I did, so that was cool.  So then I just had to write some jokes, but I've been, you know, doing that for the last six months, a year or so.  I got to ask you about Freddie Got Fingered because it makes a lot of people's lists  as the worst movie ever made.  But there's a part two to this, though, for real.  But people that do love this freaking movie, it's either you fucking love it  or you think it's a pile of garbage.  Yeah, well, it wasn't really made for, you know, the people that are putting it on those lists, you know,  these old sort of...  So that doesn't bother you when it makes those lists.  Well, you know, it did at first because I thought, you know, I thought maybe that the movie was so ridiculous 
[02:26:00]  that people would see that, you know, I wasn't trying to make the jazz singer or whatever.  Right, right.  But, you know, when they don't see that and they think, you know, you were trying to make a real serious movie  and they come in and criticize it, you know, it was a little bit surprising at first.  Now it's funny.  It's actually gotten turned into sort of this thing in the last five years.  Yeah, I mean, I just, you know...  And I didn't mean to be so harsh, but that's really how they put the movie out there. 
[02:26:30]  And then people will call all the time and go, dude, that's one of the funniest movies ever made.  It's been the coolest thing about doing this tour.  I mean, like, we've been on tour for six weeks, really basically haven't been home in six weeks.  I mean, Nashville, Houston, Lewin, Canada, Florida.  And every show, you know, halfway through the show, someone will yell out, you know,  Daddy, would you like some sausage?  Which is the scene from the movie.  You can see why it got the reviews.  But, no, but so it's cool and everyone starts singing it and it's really kind of been a fun thing. 
[02:27:00]  It's a fun sort of vindication in a lot of ways.  You know, people bring the DVDs down and it's done really good on DVD.  It's sold a million units of DVD.  So I just found that out.  I didn't know that it was...  I didn't know that people liked it as much as they did.  I mean, people always come up to me on the street and say,  Daddy, would you like some sausage all the time on the street?  And I thought, oh, this is cool, you know.  And when people started sort of really getting into it at the live show,  I called the studio and found out that it's actually selling DVDs. 
[02:27:30]  I hope you get a piece of that.  I want to do a director's cut.  I want to do a director's cut.  I hope you get a piece of that, right?  Yeah, I haven't seen a piece of it, but, you know, I think it's...  Maybe soon.  Maybe if it sells another million, that's when you get a piece of it.  Yeah, there's such scum in Hollywood.  No, we're just trying to recoup costs.  Yeah, yeah, it's going to cost a lot to make.  But I want to do a director's cut of Freddy Gutfingered.  I really do.  Because there's a lot of footage, you know, that, you know, when you make a big movie like that and it's sort of a ridiculous...  I mean, they're trying to push it, every scene, trying to make every scene so shocking that it was, you know, wrong. 
[02:28:00]  And, you know, they make you focus group the movie, then they make you change everything, and they make you shorten it and all this stuff.  So it wasn't really exactly the way I wanted it to be, so...  Back in the old MTV show days, did you find, like, you were trying to top yourself?  Like, did you...  Was it tough to go, like, oh, my God, I'm, like, sucking off an animal, and what do I do next week?  A cow.  It was a cow.  Yeah, a cow.  It was the udder.  It was a cow.  Yes, the udders.  It's a cow.  Oh, my God.  Good technique, by the way. 
[02:28:30]  I never sucked off anything other than a cow, though.  Yes, the cow.  Yeah, it's a breast.  The udder.  It's a breast.  Yeah, of course, of course.  No, I mean, you know...  And then, didn't the milk squirt in your face?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was wonderful.  I know, I do remember that.  It was definitely the goal was to try to...  It was classic.  ...get something on TV that looked like something else, but, you know...  Exactly.  But, you know, it was...  That was sort of the point.  We were always trying to top, top things, and at the time, you know, that sort of gross-out thing  wasn't something I'd really seen too much of on TV, and we were thinking, what have we not seen on TV? 
[02:29:00]  And, oh, I haven't seen anybody suck milk out of a cow's udder.  Okay, well, we should probably do that, then.  And continue with that, one of my favorites was the dead raccoon.  Yeah, oh, yeah, that's a little Canadian moment.  Yeah, he brought a dead raccoon on a Canadian.  It was a talk show, right?  Yeah, a Canadian talk show, yeah.  And the fuck, he always ends up puking, man.  Yeah.  How bad did it really, truly smell as bad as we can imagine?  Yeah, it was like the Canadian version of David Letterman.  It was called Mike Bullard, a show, and I came out with a suitcase, you know, sort of.  So I grew up watching Letterman and loving when Chris Elliott would come out with something 
[02:29:30]  in a paper bag or something, you know, and then I thought, okay, well, we'll bring out  a suitcase and pull out a dead raccoon.  I tried to shave it, and then he...  Did you almost puke?  Yeah, you know, it was pretty rank.  We'd actually had that dead raccoon for a few months, because I was doing my show in Canada  at the time.  It was before it was on MTV, but, you know, it was winter, so I'd keep it out in the balcony,  you know, and it would freeze, and then we'd thaw it out every night for the show. 
[02:30:00]  But, you know, it was fun.  It was fun.  You got it, especially back then, you just got this reputation as being completely insane.  Yeah.  And what was the separation between that Tom Green and, like, because obviously you had  to know, you have to have some kind of business sense and stuff, but you were just running  around like a complete lunatic.  Yeah.  How'd you separate that?  Yeah, you know, I mean, I always just kind of... 
[02:30:30]  And especially when people are constantly probably coming up to you and just quoting all  this stuff.  Yeah, I mean, you know, we were sort of running on a lot of adrenaline, too.  You know, it was just 10 years ago, we were sort of very excited, you know, to be just  sort of filming something.  You know, when we first started, it was just exciting to have a video camera, right?  And we had all this sort of hyperactivity, and we'd be going out and thinking of the  craziest thing to do.  And I guess I probably used to be more insane maybe when I was younger.  But then after you start putting it all on tape, you think, okay, let's save the insanity 
[02:31:00]  for when we're filming.  Yeah, not dealing with the executives or something.  Yeah, yeah.  That was the big thing that was really kind of the most, I'd say the most interesting  thing about when we went to MTV was, we'd been doing the show for about seven years in  Canada, and it was all independent, and I edited everything myself.  And then all of a sudden, we were at MTV, moved to New York City, they brought us here,  they had all these tapes, and they started re-editing everything, and taking all the weird music  out, and putting in a Will Smith instrumental or something, and, you know, taking the... 
[02:31:30]  And they'd take all the, you know, the first few months were very, you know, it was sort  of, we had big arguments all the time with the executives, you know, which was kind of  fun.  I think it actually kind of makes it kind of more of a fun story now, you know, because...  Now it does, yeah.  You know, you had to actually fight to get a lot of that stuff on the air.  And what do they know about humor?  Yeah, well, you know, it was, you know, it was one of those things where they were sort  of saying, what do you know about television?  And I was saying, well, what do you know about what I'm doing here?  Right, of course.  And, you know, it sort of...  It obviously worked, that's why I got your attention, so let me be the funny, creative 
[02:32:00]  guy, and you guys do whatever the fuck you do with your suits on.  It's always fun.  But MTV had all these rules, right?  So it was like, you know, we'd go out and we'd do all these stunts on the street, and then  often, you know, the punchline would be the reaction shot of the people on the street,  so we'd have sort of the old lady sort of, you know, looking with her wide eyes, and...  Sure.  And then they'd sort of say, well, take all those shots of all those old people out,  you know?  And it was like, well, we don't want anyone on the air who's over the age of, you know,  28 or something like that.  So I was like, well, that's the joke. 
[02:32:30]  That's the punchline.  That's the joke.  Got it.  I love when they hire you for something and then make you change what you did.  I've seen that happen too many times.  But, you know, for the most part, they came around, they, you know, they came around, let  us start doing more of what we wanted to do, and obviously it was pretty awesome that  they put us on the air in the first place, so I'm not complaining or anything.  I've thought of you hundreds of times.  When you walk by any time those outdoor little pools of water, where there's like a little  fountain, and you went in with the fucking scuba gear.  Yeah.  What is funnier than a guy doing that? 
[02:33:00]  That's just like, what a fucking, what a funny thing to do.  That was scuba hood.  That was scuba hood.  Yeah.  That's what we called that.  I'd go in the fountains and take the change and then I'd bring it to the bank at the end  of the segment.  That was one of the early bits too.  I mean, the fun thing about all those early ones is we were doing them, you know, we had  no budget.  It was me and my friends volunteering at the public access station and, you know, it's  cool because all that stuff's on YouTube now.  And when I do my live show, you know, it's sort of been a fun sort of, you know, party 
[02:33:30]  for all of the fans of my website and the old show, you know, they come out and they shout.  I mean, I didn't, I didn't immediately want to do it though.  So that's, I guess maybe before I decided to do it, I thought it was a bad idea.  You know, I just thought the whole idea of having testicular cancer was a bad idea.  But, uh, but then, uh, as soon, as soon as, uh, as soon as, as soon as we decided to do  it, you know, honestly, it was so scary that as soon as I started filming it and talking  about it and making jokes about it, it really kind of, uh, took the pressure off. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  They took a testicle out, right?  You lost a testicle.  Do you have any recurrence or did it come back or is it gone?  No, it's completely gone.  They did take my lymph nodes out.  So they cut me up here and took all the stuff out.  And then, uh, you know, they, you know, determined that I was completely cured of it at that point.  I didn't have to have chemo, didn't have to have radiation, anything like that.  If it had spread into the lymph nodes, then I would have had to have chemo.  Did they take them as a precaution?  Yeah, as a precaution.  Well, they did an MRI to see if there was anything in there. 
[02:34:30]  They couldn't tell.  So they said the only way to know for sure is to go in and do a sample.  So I elected to do that and, uh, I'm fine.  So it's been, it's been eight years.  Oh, okay.  That was one that was so hard to watch.  I got woozy.  I got so like woozy.  I can't take anything like that.  I'm like, oh, and I'm watching.  And then when they just showed the surgery, I was, I was like, I can't watch that.  Yeah, man, it was fainting.  That was, you know, talk about an out of body experience.  Cause I remember getting the footage from that, you know, where they, you know, gutted me. 
[02:35:00]  Essentially took my intestines out, set them on the, and I remember just sitting there  watching this sort of four hour surgery, you know, as they made the initial incision, you know,  and then put these clamps in and pulled my body apart.  It's now, were you out or was it a local?  Oh yeah.  A little propofol.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was out for that one.  Tom, everyone wants to talk to you.  Awesome.  I mean, this is unbelievable.  Uh, let me start with Paul in New York.  Paul, what's going on?  We've got Tom green, tomgreen.com.  And Tom's going to be at comics here in New York city, uh, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday 
[02:35:30]  this weekend.  Yes.  Go ahead, Paul.  Hey, what's going on guys?  Hey, uh, Tom, you're the fucking funniest dude I've ever, I've ever seen.  There's two, two of my favorite bits you ever did was one, you picked up the intercom at,  at a, at a mall or at the store and all the security guards.  And the other one is how the hell did you get your grandmother to bake a cake by mixing  it with a vibrator?  Yeah.  You know, it's just, uh, you know, how did we do that?  Why did we do that?  No. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Those were fun.  Those were some old ones too.  Those, we did those, you know, before MTV and, uh, you know, again, those were both kind  of very exciting times, you know, cause we were sort of just figuring out, Hey, you know,  we've got these video cameras, we can barge into this mall here and, you know, get on  the intercom or do we sort of started just doing a lot of pranks that we did when we were  kids really.  And now you'd get arrested for terrorism or something.  Yeah.  Do you find the show you're doing now, uh, on online, um, and it's a weird word to use,  but more mature than, uh, your past shows? 
[02:36:30]  Uh, yeah, you know, it's a nightly, you know, or it's modeled after a nightly show.  It's not always nightly now, but, uh, you know, I also, uh, you know, I have, I have,  I try to invite on really funny people and, uh, you know, crazy guests like Steve O comes  on all the time from Jackass and Andrew Dice Clay and Andy Dick and all sorts of crazy people  come on.  So Crispin Glover, Crispin Glover comes on.  How the hell do you get a Crispin Glover who really doesn't leave his house anywhere, you  know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I, I, I was, I was, I've known him a little bit over the years. 
[02:37:00]  I've met him around.  I was in, he was in that movie, Charlie's Angels that I did, uh, with, with him and then  we did another movie together in Edmonton, uh, Canada, independent movie a couple of years  ago called Freezer Burn.  And we kind of got to know each other on that.  And, uh, you know, I kind of, I kind of relate to people that are sort of a bit eccentric  like that.  Yeah.  And so we tend to kind of get along and, uh, so it's fun.  And, you know, the thing about doing the show is, you know, it's, it's, it is this long  format show.  It's kind of like radio more than television in a lot of ways. 
[02:37:30]  You know, it's an hour long, no commercials.  It's very conversational.  It's in my house.  And, uh, you know, the idea is I like to have the, I like to have the funny people on and  I just sort of, I'm almost playing the straight man a little bit on the show.  Wow.  Yeah.  Although, you know, there'll be a lot of times in the middle of the night where I'll, you  know, turn on the studio on drunk or something like that.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Do some dumb stuff.  Turn on drunk or no shirt.  Yeah.  How was it doing?  And there's tons of really ridiculous stuff on, on the website.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's just when I, when I sit down and I have to have a sort of a serious interview, you 
[02:38:00]  know, Kathy Griffin came up, you know, she's going to be the funny  one.  I'm going to be the, I'm going to, I'm going to be the, uh, straight person.  Let's go to the phones.  Uh, Mike in Jersey city.  We got Tom green, Mike.  Yeah.  Tom green.  How you doing buddy?  How are you, Mike?  What's going on?  Hello.  Uh, my store was the store you came into with the cow where you had the Mexican suck the  udders.  What?  That was your store?  That was my store.  Wow.  Promptly quit two weeks later.  You quit.  Because all his Mexican buddies, no, it's my store.  My Mexican quit because all his buddies were giving him a hard time that, uh, 
[02:38:30]  he was sucking the udder on TV.  Yeah.  And don't be actually believed me until it aired.  That's cool.  I remember that you asked for a car wash to bring the cow to.  Did you ever bring the cow to a car wash?  I don't, I don't recall doing that, but, uh, yeah, that, that, that, that's, uh, I don't  think.  It was pretty wild.  We almost got arrested.  That's another place.  We almost got arrested.  We almost got arrested at some train station over there near your store.  I think that's in Hoboken.  I heard about that.  Yeah.  When you walk in with my mom who yelled at you and said, well, what, what is this? 
[02:39:00]  What, what is this?  And she still to this day doesn't realize what it was and doesn't believe it.  That's what I did.  I saw her on YouTube last night.  I remember the fun, the fun part about that was I didn't know you could ride a cow, but  you know, when you're in a grocery store with a cow and there's cameras, you think,  well, I might as well just jump, jump onto it.  Sure.  And it would see what happens.  What happened at the train station?  Um, I think I just, I just remember a cop came at us pretty hard because we had a cow  there.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks for the call.  Thanks, man.  Nick in Cleveland.  Nick. 
[02:39:30]  Hey boys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Jimmy.  Hi.  Um, Tom Green.  I just wanted to tell you that one of the funniest things I've ever seen on TV is when  you toured the Marshmallow Factory and I don't know where you were, but.  Was it Las Vegas?  Yeah.  Why there's a Marshmallow Factory in Las Vegas?  I guess, I guess, I don't know.  I'm wondering that.  Yeah.  Sort of a strange place for it, but yeah.  Yeah.  That was fun.  Well, you know, cause this was just another sort of a real clever bit where when the marshmallows  come out of the machine, they look like, you know, large, uh, phallic things. 
[02:40:00]  So of course, you know, I had to, you know.  Follate the sweetness.  Yeah.  See what that would look like on television.  But, um, yeah.  God damn it.  That's really good.  Fun ways of skirting past the sensors, you know?  And then, you know, there was, I remember there was always these arguments like, oh,  you know, with the, you know, cause they have the standards and practices people.  And, you know, so I'd be sucking on this marshmallow, you know, dong or whatever you  want to call it.  You could say cock.  I don't even know what I want. 
[02:40:30]  I don't know if I want to say that I'm sucking on a marshmallow cock, though.  I don't know if I want to say that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  To say that.  But, uh, you know, and then it's like, well, you have to edit that down a little bit.  You know, use, you can use three seconds of it.  Yeah.  Well, we'd send the edit back with seven seconds of it.  And we'd sort of settle at five seconds.  I'm a creative and funny process standards and practices.  People come right between paperclips and erasers.  They are shit.  They're overprotecting networks.  They're fucking terrible.  S&P people are the worst.  It happens to us in radio, too. 
[02:41:00]  We're all in this, in agreement today.  It's unbelievable.  They are the worst.  They ruin everything funny.  If there's something funny, standards and practices, people will somehow find a way  to fucking remove it and destroy it.  Let's see how to Rick in Brooklyn.  Rick.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday, Jim.  Thank you.  Tom Green, huge fan, man.  Love the movie.  I heard you say, Daddy, would you like the sausage?  One great line you got to do is when you said, I'm 27 goddamn years old, Dad, I can have  a chicken sandwich if I want to.  Yes. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, okay.  I'll do that one Thursday night at Comics.  Come Thursday night, we'll do the chicken sandwich one.  No doubt, dude.  Do all my chicken sandwich stuff.  It's hysterical how people are just compelled to hear you say lines that they're talking about.  That's what they remember, because they remember so many lines from your TV show and movies.  They don't understand how stand-up works.  They'll yell something and expect you to do something.  Like, he'll be in the middle of a joke.  And so I walk and somebody will yell, Freddie got fingered!  Like, the good thing creatively to do is stop the joke and go, yes, that was a film. 
[02:42:00]  Fucking blithering idiots, just shut up in the crowd.  But it's fun, though.  I mean, you know, I've sort of found a way to, towards the end of the set, like, I encourage  people a bit, and I do kind of interact with the audience a lot, and it sort of is a little  bit of a high-energy night, you know?  So come on down to the show, everyone, and let's yell some dumb stuff.  Tom keeps promoting it.  You don't have to promote this. 
[02:42:30]  You're going to have some great crowds of comics.  How many shows are you doing?  Because I really want to have a good crowd in New York, so we're in New York City.  You know, I feel like I've been on this mission, you know?  So, you know, like, I'm so into this that, like, I'm not stopping.  We're going from here to Chicago, then we're going to Phoenix, and then Dallas, and then  we're doing a tour of Australia.  I've never been to Australia in my life.  Doing an entire month, ten cities over there.  Do they have ten cities in Australia?  I think so, yeah.  Nine, he's doing Sydney twice.  I think I know two, maybe.  Yeah, Brisbane, Adelaide, Gold Coast, Melbourne, all sorts of places. 
[02:43:00]  Did you, like, sit down and write, though, for stand-up and go, like, holy shit, I don't  know how to do this type of writing.  Like, obviously, you write for TV shows and stuff, but stand-up, completely different.  Were you kind of perplexed a little at first?  Well, I did a monologue on my show for a while, and when I was doing that, I had some really  great writers working with me.  My friend Gabe Abelson is a really hilarious guy.  Yeah, I know Gabe.  I thought you might know him, yeah, and he's written for a lot, he's been doing stand-up 
[02:43:30]  for a long time, and he shows, and you sort of get into that cadence.  You fell into it, though, like...  And I had done it for three years when I was a, you know, teenager, but I was 15 years  old, so it was always sort of very out of my element, you know, but...  But then to actually sit and write, especially, you say you do an hour?  Yeah.  To, like, sit and write material like that is a lot of different.  I actually find it really kind of fun, because what I've started doing is, you know, I used  to carry a notepad around with me, and whenever I had an idea, I'd write down on a notepad, 
[02:44:00]  and then I'd lose the notepad.  But now, you know, the cell phones have all these, you know, my iPhone has a notepad  in it, so every time I, you know, if I'm out with my friends, we're talking, something  funny comes up in conversation, I'll write it down on the notepad on the phone, and then,  you know, every once in a while, I'll sit down.  I actually do sit down at the computer, though, and craft it together, and then I'll sit  down with my friend Gabe or other friends of mine, and we'll, you know, punch it up,  find some punchlines.  Or talk it into a recorder if you have to.  Sometimes, if you have the following, there's, like, a record option.  Sometimes it's, like, it's hard to write, you can just whisper something stupid into  your thing and listen to it later.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:44:30]  I see you got Florentine on.  Iraq, Iraq is just playing clips.  Iraq, just show the clip, but don't play.  Oh, cool, yeah.  Florentine, you went on.  What was Jim on?  Dan, okay.  Are you saying difference, really?  Yeah.  Jim Florentine's come on a bunch of times, and we always do prank calls.  We just call Japan.  It's called Calling Japan on YouTube if you want to.  Florentine.  Florentine's got giant balls.  Did he mention that to you?  I think he did tell me that.  He tells everyone that.  Don't rub it in.  Yeah, it really made me jealous. 
[02:45:00]  Fuck.  You got a fake one in there, at least?  I don't, no.  I was given the option.  You know, I was given the option, and I just thought, you know, it's...  Is it really, like, a fucking ping pong ball?  I think so.  You just decide not to go with it.  That's just so cliche.  Everyone's getting these fake balls these days.  That's one of my jokes.  It works.  Go to comics for more of that.  Let me ask you, does it affect the loads at all when you're missing one, or does it  not affect them at all?  No, you know, it doesn't seem to.  It doesn't seem to. 
[02:45:30]  But, you know, everything's fine.  Everything's working.  It's almost like, you know, nothing really ever happened, really, which is a good thing.  I mean, everything's working fine.  Plumbing's all working fine.  Everything's great.  And, you know...  Taking regular jobs.  I talk about this in the show, too.  I sort of, you know, get into some sort of real, you know, vivid and disgusting detail  about everything.  But, no, it's...  You know, that was obviously the scariest part of it.  You know, when you first find out you got testicular cancer, it's like, oh, God, am I 
[02:46:00]  going to be able to...  Yeah.  You can swear on the radio, right?  Yeah.  You're not going to be able to fuck, you know?  Yeah, exactly.  So, you can say that.  I'm serious.  No, I think you could fuck, but I've debated the vasectomy, but I heard that the loads  are less.  And, to me, if it's not somehow going to be a disaster to get out of her hair and eyebrows,  it's not worth doing.  Like, I heard the loads are just less...  Like, there's less of it.  You want it to be chunky.  You want it to be chunky, yeah.  I want to hear this.  God damn it!  Like, 20 minutes later in the bathroom.  I just got to say it. 
[02:46:30]  Drew Barrymore.  Yeah.  I just want to say Drew Barrymore.  Yeah.  I just want to say it.  I was certainly...  That's all you really need to say.  I was certainly very jealous.  She, uh...  Wow.  Always loved Drew Barrymore.  What was the...  Do you guys at least still talk, or is it just...  Uh...  I haven't really talked to her in about six years, actually.  Okay.  That says a lot.  It's not...  I don't know if it's because there's any issue.  I just think it's because I don't think I have her phone number.  I don't think she has... 
[02:47:00]  I don't think we have each other's phone numbers anymore.  But, uh...  There was...  Obviously, there was an issue at one point.  That's why we got divorced.  But, uh...  I think now I have no real problem with...  Would have no problem talking to her.  I just, uh...  I don't know how to get a hold of her, actually.  Uh...  I think maybe I'm going to put a call into the office, actually.  Yeah.  Leave a message over at her office or something.  Are you a single guy?  A dating?  What are you doing?  Uh...  You know, I have a girlfriend in L.A.  But, uh...  Sort of a new girlfriend I'm seeing.  But, uh...  You know, it's, uh... 
[02:47:30]  Been pretty much single the past year or so.  Marriage, like, out of the question.  You just don't see...  No, it's not out of the question.  I'm just kind of looking for the...  You know, the right time, the right moment.  You know, I'll know when it's the right time.  But right now, you know, the thing is, I'm just having so much fun.  Just...  You know, this year, I think I'm really going to spend the year on the road, really, is what I've decided to do.  That's great, man.  Yeah.  And being able to do that, you know...  Seemed like a good time for it.  You know, I'm not married and...  You've got a lot of pussy on the road.  I know what you're saying.  I know what you're saying.  It's amazing.  And then you have an excuse to leave.  I've got a flight to catch it. 
[02:48:00]  And she has to spit it out and go, all right, well, thanks.  Here's a search, whore.  I'd really love to go out.  He's only with the best girls.  Here's a search, whore.  If I lived in Dallas, we'd be going out, you know.  But, uh...  That's not happening.  Yeah.  Yeah, hey, look.  Fucking Tom Green.  Oh, uh...  Just got to ask, because it's happening.  The Olympics, Canada?  Do you care?  Well, we won our first gold medal.  Yes.  On a Canadian...  That was a big deal.  Yeah.  I'm surprised we haven't won a gold medal in Canada. 
[02:48:30]  That's the first time we've ever won a Winter Olympics gold medal in Canada, they said.  Yeah, you would think.  Which I thought was kind of strange.  You'd think, why wouldn't Canada have won more gold medals, right?  I mean, we're a winter country.  Yes, of course.  Right, so it's good we finally got that, you know.  What was that?  The women's hockey?  We're just...  What?  Yeah, no, it was...  What was the gold medal?  It was, uh...  What's it called?  Moguls.  Moguls.  Oh, the moguls.  Freestyle moguls.  Jimmy describes moguls.  Did you describe moguls again for Tom Green?  Oh!  Whoosh!  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, 
[02:49:00]  whoosh!  Yeah.  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,  That's exactly what the commentator says.  That was fucking impressive.  I've never seen it before, and I watched it, and I'm like, somebody has...  They have to be ruining their hips and their legs and their ankles.  That was great.  I actually enjoyed that.  I usually despise the Olympics, but I really enjoyed watching that.  Yeah, it was cool.  It was funny.  We were watching another day, and they had a little story about the flame being run across  the country, and they showed the route that it runs.  And, you know, the route goes right up into the Arctic Circle. 
[02:49:30]  I mean, you know, 99% of the population of Canada lives within, you know, 10 miles of  the U.S. border, you know, and nobody lives up there.  But, you know, and they did this big piece on Good Morning America about it, and, you  know, they're running past igloos, and, you know, it's all Eskimos up there.  They probably went out, no one noticed, they just relived.  And I'm sure everyone in the world now thinks that's what Canada is, you know, it's igloos.  Well, that's what everybody thinks anyway.  Yeah, it is.  Frozen tundra, a few cities.  You dragged out some impressive people for the opening ceremonies, and Murray. 
[02:50:00]  I mean, come on.  I follow her on Twitter.  It's amazing how often she talks about taking shits.  Only the best for the Olympics, Ann Murray and Steve Nash.  I've got to follow Ann Murray on Twitter.  That would be good.  That would be just exciting.  I didn't know Sutherland was Canadian.  I'm a fucking hero.  Who doesn't like Donald Sutherland?  He was Canadian.  Kiefer Sutherland's father, too.  Kiefer Sutherland's father, too.  I always look at Kiefer as Donald's son.  You can tell, though, early on in Donald Sutherland's career, he kind of does have the accent. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Kelly's heroes.  Definitely.  Or a film called Little Murders.  Great fucking comedy he did with Vincent Gardena and Elliot Gould from, like, the mid-70s.  He plays a preacher.  No?  Nobody saw that?  Invasion of the Body Snatch is where he goes,  Oot!  Oot!  Oh, there's Canadian there.  Truce on your side.  Pardon me.  Ow!  What?  I don't know.  That was a tremendous bomb. 
[02:51:00]  But I didn't think it was a bomb.  He just...  Oh, stop it.  I'll identify my bombs.  You were quoting him.  The Bombay door's open.  I dropped it.  Let's go to Ottawa.  Rob.  Ottawa.  There.  My hometown.  We're in Canada right now.  My hometown, Ottawa.  They're hearing us in Canada as well.  Rob, what's up, buddy?  Not too much.  How's it going, Tom Green?  Really good.  How are you?  What part of Ottawa are you calling from?  What part of Ottawa?  Yeah, what part of Ottawa?  Nepean.  Okay, Nepean.  Nice.  I went to school in Nepean.  At Algonquin College.  Yes.  Algonquin College.  Algonquin College.  Is that in the middle of Canada? 
[02:51:30]  Where in Canada is Ottawa?  It's north of New York State.  Okay.  North of here, yeah.  It's north of here.  11-hour drive.  Way north.  But it's north of Syracuse.  Kind of north of Syracuse, you know.  Yeah.  So what's going on in Ottawa?  Not too much.  It's colder than hell up here.  I've actually got one question for you.  Okay.  Have you heard from Glenn Humphlick lately?  You know, I have, yeah.  Glenn Humphlick's doing good.  Glenn Humphlick's living in Ottawa.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who's Glenn Humphlick?  He was my co-host on my show. 
[02:52:00]  And, you know, he decided he didn't really want to pursue a career in show business.  What is he doing now?  He was always very much into the high-tech stuff, you know.  He was always, you know, really very computer savvy.  He kind of helped me start the website back in 1996.  That's why we had one so early, because he was always involved with that.  But he's...  HTML.  Yeah.  Typing things out.  So he's still doing that, and he's working up in Ottawa, Canada, doing that.  Yep. 
[02:52:30]  Perfect.  Cool, man.  Perfect.  All right.  Thank you very much, Larry.  Thank you, Larry.  Yeah.  Let's go to Steve in Syracuse.  Steve.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  I can't believe I'm talking to you, man.  I'm a huge fan.  Right.  I have a question for you, and kind of a little comment.  I know Rip Torn played your father in Freddy Got Fingered.  I wondered if you still had contact with him, and if you know any inside information about  his whole ordeal that happened recently with the bank.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know anything other than what I read on TMZ, but, you know, I'm worried about him. 
[02:53:00]  He's a great guy.  I mean, he's, you know, a real classic, old-school actor, and it was so cool to be able to work  with him in the movie.  You know, he'd go out.  We shot the movie in Vancouver, actually, and he would go out on the weekends and, you  know, catch salmon.  He'd go out into the mountains, catch salmon, bring salmon in for the crew and stuff.  Really kind of a cool guy.  Adventurer.  But I guess, you know, I don't think he actually was breaking into the bank.  No, in his defense, the stupid fucking bank looked like a house. 
[02:53:30]  It really did.  It was.  It's an old house.  I'd have walked into that.  And it even looked kind of like his house.  Yeah.  I saw a picture of his.  Except it was, like, jam-packed with money, which kind of upsets the police when you just  walk in.  And he did have a gun.  Yeah, yeah.  But God bless him, man.  Breaks in and then falls asleep thinking he's in his house.  That's a great story.  He's in rehab now, I think.  I think they sent him to rehab.  Don't say he's too old for that.  Don't clean him up.  Let him be.  No, no.  At some point in your life, you just stick with what worked for you. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you're in your 70s and drinking just works.  How about this?  If you're breaking into a bank with a gun and dozing off, it's not working for you.  How about that?  All right, Jimmy.  If he tipped a few back and, you know, he fell asleep while watching the game, then it's  working for you.  When you break into a bank with a pistol and fall asleep.  All right.  Good point, Jim.  Good point.  Let's go to Chris in Denver.  Chris?  Hey, Tom.  Hello, hello.  I just wanted to...  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead.  He hears you. 
[02:54:30]  Hey, I was just wondering about the, where's my dinner bitch statue?  Uh-oh, yeah.  Is that something you held on to?  Well, my dad pretty much destroyed that the day of.  That was probably the bit that sort of ended it with my folks as far as doing the crazy  bits anymore.  They really put their foot down.  They, we put these statues on the front lawn of them sort of, you know, in sexual positions  and all this kind of stuff.  Yeah.  That's the one that I kind of get a little uncomfortable with talking about because, you 
[02:55:00]  know, which is why I'll talk about it.  But, you know, the thing is because, you know, they really got really mad at that one.  You know?  They, I think my mother was really offended by that.  You know?  I didn't see that one.  It's a classic Tom Green.  And they call, and now, the thing about that was, that was one of the ones where most of  the bits we did, like the slut mobile was, was the big one where we painted their car  with the pornography, the lesbian pornography in the car.  They had to take the bus to work and stuff.  And that we did before we went to MTV, and that was sort of a big deal to us.  We'd invested $400 in going to get the guy who did the good airbrushing, and it was a 
[02:55:30]  big deal.  Then we were on MTV, and we had a budget, so we had, you know, $5,000.  We got this artist in Ottawa to build these statues out of paper mache and all this stuff.  And so I think they sort of felt this sort of coming sort of onslaught of MTV budget pranks  getting worse.  And they really threatened to sue the show.  I've been living in New York for a couple weeks, and we got this voicemail from them, 
[02:56:00]  which we played on the show.  My father called MTV, and he said, if you air that bit, I'm going to sue you bastards  for $1 million.  And the thing that was so fun about that bit was it was just sort of a bizarre, such a  bizarre whirlwind.  But, you know, we were on the air.  We were doing all these bits, and my parents weren't going to sign the release form to let  us air that particular bit.  There it is there.  There's the statues.  Yeah, the statues.  And on YouTube.  What are they doing in the statue?  It's, where's my dinner, bitch? 
[02:56:30]  That's the where's my dinner, bitch statue.  Yeah.  My father has a rolled up newspaper or a club, and he's going to hit Tom Green's mouth.  The next one is the worst one.  What's the next one?  That was the, there's...  And look, she's all a sleepy eye and everything.  I always felt bad for your parents watching your show.  Is that, who's that taking on your dad?  That's my dad.  Yeah, he wasn't happy with it.  But the thing that was crazy about that was, so they weren't going to let that air.  That was never going to air.  And then somehow, you know, we've been on the air for two weeks. 
[02:57:00]  Oprah Winfrey was doing a Mother's Day special where she brought on people to, and their mothers,  and somehow she heard about our crazy bits on MTV,  brought, flew me and my mom and dad to Chicago.  My parents didn't really...  Yeah.  That's the one.  That's the one that they're upset about.  Explain it, Jimmy.  Explain it.  She's bent over with her hands on her legs, and dad has one arm raised,  and has given it to her from the back.  Yeah, the hoe's running up into my dad's... 
[02:57:30]  The hoe is running up.  So the water.  But, which I thought was kind of creative, but they didn't see the...  They didn't see it that way.  I don't know the art.  But so Oprah brought us to...  This was before this aired, so Oprah hadn't seen this bit.  Okay.  But she brought, flew my parents to New York, flew me to New York,  and had me come out and apologize for the Slutmobile and for painting their house  and doing all these wake-ups in the middle of the night.  And she sent my parents to Tahiti on a three-week cruise.  Wow.  And right after the show, when they found out they got this trip, 
[02:58:00]  I whipped out the release form out of my backpack.  Could you just sign this, please?  I said, come on, Mom.  See, Oprah thinks this is funny.  This isn't that bad.  And they signed it, and it aired.  And they said, that's got to be the last one ever, though.  Wow.  That was the last bit you did with your parents?  Well, no, you know, and then I actually, I sort of agreed that I would stop doing anything  that involves sort of sex stuff.  Right.  The last one I really did that was sort of a prank actually involved Monica Lewinsky when we brought her up to Ottawa.  And I knew that it was time to stop doing the jokes to them because my parents didn't know I was in town. 
[02:58:30]  We barged into my parents' bedroom at four in the morning with Monica Lewinsky.  My dad sat up in bed, and he said, oh, hey, Monica, how you doing?  And it was just sort of completely unfazed, sort of ready for it.  And I thought, okay, they're getting too hip to this now.  They're getting too hip to this now.  It's not funny anymore.  And I've seen too many times where other shows after that have faked it, and it just looks so phony. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  It was always the biggest thing that, you know, we had rules on the show.  We had rules was, you know, we never wanted to fake anything.  We never wanted to put anybody, you know, pretending to react to something.  Yeah, yeah.  And we always had to try to sort of find ways to get people to react real, you know.  Yeah, there's the Slutmobile right there.  I still have the hood.  I kept the hood.  Oh, do you?  I have the Slutmobile hood.  And you know what, Tom?  With everything that's going on with the internet and stuff, it's not dated.  You can watch the Tom Green videos today and get your ass off. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, that's what's – it's actually a really exciting thing that YouTube came to be and all this stuff because, you know, all these bits are out there now.  Yeah, who would have known where you would have been able to see this?  Yeah, it sort of just would have just been sort of something that you'd never see again.  But now it's sort of – you know, at the time, you know, we put some of this stuff.  And this is sort of a – you know, the Slutmobile, you know, sort of a big part of my life in a weird kind of way, you know.  Because, you know, I was inventing something and, you know, trying to figure out how to get a job in broadcasting.  And, you know, this was – it's fun to be able to go back and look at that stuff. 
[03:00:00]  You know, talking about your show, did you really get pissed off when – I think it was the Jacko guy with the chainsaw at your desk.  Were you really pissed off at that?  I was, yeah.  I was.  Because it seems like it would be really tough to really piss you off with all the stunts you've done over the years.  Well, it was TV really pissed off.  I mean, I kind of – again, like, sort of goes into sort of – I have these sort of rules on the show.  You know, and I get a lot of shit about that on the web, actually. 
[03:00:30]  People, you know, people email me and they post under that thing and say,  Ah, you know, fucking Tom Green, he used to chainsaw shit and then the guy chainsaws him and he acts like an asshole.  But, see, the point is, is it's – you know, first of all, when I used to watch David Letterman, you know,  and something would go wrong, you know, Crispin Glover would kick him or something would happen.  Yeah.  That was always my favorite part, you know, when something would go wrong and you'd see something, you know,  or when I brought the raccoon on Mike Bullard and he got mad at me. 
[03:01:00]  And so here I was in a position where I was on the other side and there was a bit of a back story.  We'd actually had this desk specially made by MTV after a long battle about the budget because it cost –  you know, we had the L.A. set designer people because it's the exact replica of the Johnny Carson Tonight Show desk  from his first show in New York.  It sort of looks very similar to it.  And so it cost $10,000 from one of these set designer things. 
[03:01:30]  And they kept saying, well, why don't you just go by a desk at the junk shop?  Like Kia or something.  And we had this huge argument.  This was our second week of on the air of this nightly show.  Wow.  And he did tell us he was going to do it.  And he came out and he started cutting the thing and I was mad.  And I said, well, you know, what would David Letterman do?  You know what I mean?  Would he pretend it was really funny if somebody was cutting his desk up?  No.  He'd get pissed off and he'd tell the guy to screw off.  Who is the guy?  He's from this rock band called Jackal. 
[03:02:00]  And he plays guitar with a chainsaw attached to it.  So the bit was he was just going to come out and play guitar and turn on the chainsaw and that would be it.  But he didn't say that he was going to cut the desk.  So he had a reason to have the chainsaw.  But I mean, I actually kind of really, this is one of my favorite moments, you know, from that show because it is.  It's real.  It is real.  It's a real moment.  It was actually basically was channeling, trying to copy David Letterman basically here.  There's this moment where I used to love when I was a kid where he had Harvey P. Carr on the who they did. 
[03:02:30]  They did a movie about him a few years ago called American Splendor.  He was a guy that a cartoon artist and he had testicular cancer also.  And he came on and he said something that pissed off Dave.  And Dave sort of kept saying, oh, take your little weekly reader, rainy day pamphlet, fun, fun pamphlet for boys and girls thing.  So I said all those lines in this to this guy.  I took out a CD and I go, oh, take your rainy day fun CD for boys and girls, you know.  So it was an act, you know, it was an act. 
[03:03:00]  But it was also I was mad.  So that's the answer.  You know, I feel like I have to explain that because I do get a lot of crap for that, though.  That's a good explanation.  Fuck those people on message boards and frigging chat rooms and everything else.  Clueless.  I get so pissed off sometimes.  I stopped reading.  Tom is hosting tonight an hour long special.  It's from five to six.  It's on Raw Dog, which is Sirius 104 XM 150.  What are you doing on that?  Are you just talking a lot or phone calls or playing bits? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, we're going to go and take some phone calls.  My friend Sean, who's on tour with me, is coming in.  We're going to sort of talk about the tour, probably play some comedy bits.  And take a lot of phone calls and move off.  Speaking of the stand-up, Luke in Edmonton saw you recently.  Luke.  Good evening, boy.  Hey, Luke.  That was our first show, our first weekend.  It was.  And I felt like Jimmy there creepily sitting next to you eating lunch.  And I said, you know, Tom, can I get a photograph? 
[03:04:00]  And you took it with me.  And I was forever grateful.  My girlfriend was tickled.  I felt really like a creep.  Tickled.  Thank you so much.  Wait.  Thank you, Aunt Luke.  Yeah, that was cool.  Yeah, that was really, Luke.  It says tickled.  What Tom wants to hear, it says Tom Green was brilliant.  Why aren't you telling him that?  Oh, he was absolutely beautiful.  On the stage, the nut humor, you just can't get enough of that.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why I listen to you guys.  You just can't get enough of it.  And I'm certainly hoping Jimmy comes to Edmonton, not just for Rich Voss's wedding or anniversary 
[03:04:30]  or divorce, just to come here and actually do another show with Patrice.  Like, these people absolutely broke.  Thank you.  Great one up there called the comic strip.  You should go play that.  I'd like to perform up there.  I'm doing Montreal this year, I think, for the festival for the first time in years.  I haven't been to Canada in a long time.  You should do a little Canadian thing, Jimmy.  I want to do it.  Let's go to Dave in New Hampshire.  Dave?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  I just want to ask Tom if he can explain the cow's head in his parents' bedroom. 
[03:05:00]  And, Tom, I met you from Blanc one time.  Tried to buy you a drink on New Year's Eve of the Millennium, but you were too busy trying  to find your contact line.  Okay.  It's funny what they remember.  I don't wear contacts.  That was just what he told you because you were annoying him, sir.  Yeah.  The cow head was kind of a – we put a cow – walked in my parents' bedroom and put  a cow head in their bed and sort of a – but it was actually sort of a spontaneous thing.  We were doing another bit with the cow heads, which is probably even harder to explain, but 
[03:05:30]  we were doing a bit called Cow Brain Boat.  That's one that's never aired on MTV.  Probably a good thing it never did.  But basically, I made a boat out of some cow brains, and it was on my public access show.  We went to a slaughterhouse.  We got these four cow heads.  We took the brains.  We made a – we fashioned a boat out of it and then floated it off down the river.  But we had these cow heads, and we had to get rid of them at the end of the shoot, and 
[03:06:00]  we were sort of dropping them off in the dumpster at the school near my house.  And then we thought, you know, this – we should probably just go toss one of these in my  parents' bed.  It's two in the morning.  You know, what a waste.  Yeah.  There we go.  There we go.  So we brought them in and put them in the bed and said, this is a message from Don Corleone.  It says, Luca Vrazi sleeps with the fishes.  Yeah.  Couldn't have been happy about that.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ, man.  Yeah.  It's great stuff.  It's –  Memories, right? 
[03:06:30]  Probably not one of the better ones to talk about on the radio.  Don't you like when people walk up to you and ask you where you get your ideas from?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what he says.  I'm looking for my contact lens.  Leave me alone.  Exactly.  Yeah, Tom, you said you were looking for your mini – I couldn't think of mini horse.  What are you going to say?  Mini pony.  I was going to say pony, and then I thought mini horse.  I'm like, that's not a word.  What is wrong with you?  I don't know.  I said something that didn't make sense.  It's an odd question.  It's an odd question to answer.  How do you answer that question?  I mean, it's –  I pretend I didn't – I'm deaf.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  I say I don't – what did you say?  And I make them repeat it until they walk away.  You must have gotten this a lot.  Oh, boy, don't be using this on your show now.  Yeah.  Don't be using this on your show.  He's going to talk about us next show.  Don't worry, I won't.  You're a fucking –  Using this on your show now.  Yeah.  Don't be using this on your show.  He's going to talk about us next show.  Don't worry, I won't.  You're a fucking dullard.  It's like at a party or something.  I'm not going to talk about you unless I need to clear a room out.  He's going to use this on his show, I bet. 
[03:07:30]  No.  I always just tell people – I just give them some stupid answer.  Like, ah, life experience.  It's fucking awful.  Yeah.  You don't say life experience.  What else am I going to say?  Well, you just ignore it.  My process?  Nobody wants to hear my process.  Boring.  We got a urologist on the phone, which is very good news.  Evan in Bayville.  Evan, he's going to explain a little bit for Jimmy.  Yes.  I just wanted to explain to Jimmy why after a septic or a testicle removal, there's no  change in the semen.  Basically, the whole percent of the fluid comes from the testicles. 
[03:08:00]  Most of it comes from the prostate.  Okay.  So that's – there's usually no change in anything except there's no sperm there.  And with the one testicle removed, you know, you've got a normal other one, so there's  no change.  Hey, Evan, good news, it stays chunky?  As chunky as you like.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  Because that's what Jimmy's worried about, the chunky factor.  Yeah, no sperm, so is it the same color or is it only clear?  Does it have a different viscosity?  It should have no change.  Okay.  No change.  Jimmy just wants to know if it tastes the same.  There we go.  It's good to have that clinical thing backing me up, you know, because I have a feeling 
[03:08:30]  that when I say that it's exactly the same, a lot of people don't believe me.  They probably don't believe you.  They think you're lying.  Yeah.  Tom, everyone – I mean, these phones are still lit, man.  Still lit for you.  Tyson in Oklahoma.  Tyson?  Hi, morning, everybody.  What's going on, Tom?  What's up, Tyson?  Hey, man.  How are you?  Hey, I'm just wondering, man.  You still play guitar and add that into your stand-up?  Yeah, I do.  I do actually pull the guitar out in the middle of the show and do – I do the bum-bum song  live.  It's supposed to be a surprise, but, you know, but there you go. 
[03:09:00]  I blew the surprise.  The big hit.  Yeah, the big hit.  I went to number one.  Number one on TRL.  Well, that was a crazy story about MTV.  They made me retire.  How about just be quiet, Tyson?  Yeah, Tyson, you're fucking panicking.  Jesus.  He's trying to explain something, and you're panicking.  I pull the guitar out for a minute and do a couple songs.  I sing a song from the movie Road Trip, the Salmon Song, and just two little songs in the  middle, which is fun.  And I do a guitar solo, which is fun.  But for the most part, it's just, you know, no props or anything. 
[03:09:30]  It's just straight stand-up.  What did MTV make you retire?  They made you retire?  Okay, well, we did the bum-bum song, which we basically wrote, you know, on a napkin in  Seattle and thought, okay, let's see.  We went and took a bunch of Polaroid pictures around Seattle and thought, okay, of a bunch  of things I could stick my bum on, and then made this song.  And we went to the Seattle radio station, and the bit was we played the song in the radio  station and tried to get people to call in and vote for it.  Well, the show was doing pretty good on MTV at the time, and at the end of the day, it 
[03:10:00]  was the number one song in Seattle.  So we went back to New York, and we thought, this is pretty cool.  We went back to New York.  We told everyone, we got the number one song in Seattle.  We got to try to get this on TRL.  So we went on our show that week and said, call Carson Daly, vote for this.  We played our video.  And it went to number one on TRL in the very first night.  And so then the next day, it was number one again.  And we were sort of beginning of the week.  And we get these sort of nervous calls from the MTV executives saying, you got to retire. 
[03:10:30]  We want to retire your song.  And we were like, well, why?  We're number one.  The other songs stay number one for three weeks, four weeks.  Well, we want you to retire the song on Friday.  It's not a real song.  We said, well, it's a real song.  Well, you don't have a record deal.  Well, it's being voted, Total Request Live, right?  Why can't we keep it number one?  And they said, well, you know, to be honest with you, I mean, we've pre-taped Total Request 
[03:11:00]  Live next week, so it's all fake.  And, you know, everyone's going to wonder why 98 Degrees is on the countdown and not you  next week.  So, you know, you got to retire it.  So we played ball and retired it.  I said, I would never say anything about it, but there we go.  That's what happened.  So that was what it was.  It was 10 years ago.  The show's not on the air anymore.  Anyways, I know Carson Daly had to go out of town for the week or something like that.  So they actually pre-taped a week of TRL, you know, and I guess they just kind of faked 
[03:11:30]  all the requests.  All the requests.  Faked all the voting.  It's a bunch of bullshit.  Yeah.  Bravo for the honesty.  What's the Hitler story?  Is that true or not?  Completely not true.  That was a weird rumor.  It's a big rumor, though.  Big rumor.  There was a while there where I thought, oh, is this going to, you know, be something that  really kind of dogs me for a long time?  And I, but I never did that.  Never, never did that.  Never really have done any racial humor on the show.  I don't really, I just kind of, maybe it's a Canadian thing or something like that, 
[03:12:00]  but I just sort of avoided it.  We don't even have to say what the rumor was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Most people know anyway.  A lot of people.  I don't know.  It still floats out there.  People are wondering if it was true or not.  Probably no worse than what I do on a nightly basis in my house.  There's various versions of it.  I haven't heard it that much in the last couple of years, but when I, basically what  happened was when I got cancer and the show stopped pretty abruptly, there was a rumor  that I got canceled because I dressed up as Hitler and there's one version was I went 
[03:12:30]  to a bar mitzvah with a, you know, a paintball gun or something like that dressed  as Hitler.  You know, and you know, I never, I've never done that.  The only reason I bring it up, you think someone had it out for you and they were trying to  fuck you over a little bit?  You know, I, I, I kind of think that I heard, I've heard a few, a few versions of how it  started.  One was some kid did it in Boston and there was, you know, the police arrested him and  he said he was me and it made a local paper.  Another version was, uh, there was a show that there was being, uh, there was a sort 
[03:13:00]  of a prank show on TV that somebody did something like that.  But honestly, I don't know where it came from, but it really was one of those strange, you  know, it was sort of my gerbil in the ass.  But I actually, you know, remember putting a whole, a whole, wrote a whole letter and  put it on my website and saying, you know, I would never do something.  People didn't believe it, even though you're writing this on your website, I'm sure.  First of all, Hitler wouldn't have done it.  He'd have sent one of his henchmen.  Yes. 
[03:13:30]  So it wouldn't have been historically accurate.  Exactly.  That's what it was.  I was actually dressed up as Joseph Goebbels or whatever.  Come on, people.  Right.  And are you still doing the webcast?  Because some people think that's canceled.  You just don't do it as frequent.  I've canceled myself a few times.  It's a great thing about, you know, doing a show in your living room.  But, uh, no, it's, uh, it's, it's, it's still going on.  We're basically, I'm just on tour right now.  Taking a break.  And, uh, you know, I'm on the road right now and what I'm doing is I actually take  this, uh, I take a video camera with me, which is always on me.  And, uh, it's just a little tiny flip cam.  I'll just shoot something right now. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, look at that.  Oh, that's, that's the still shot.  But, uh, and, you know, I, I shoot all sorts of, uh, you know, little videos on the road  and we post these on opening and Anthony right now.  But, um, so yeah, so you can follow along the tour on the web.  You go tomgreen.com, you can follow along with the tour.  And then we actually tell people who are coming to our shows to, uh, to, uh,  bring cameras down.  I don't really, we don't ask them to film during the show.  Cause that kind of flips me out a bit.  Cause I don't really, you know, I like to talk about things that I don't want to see on  YouTube, but, uh, but after the show, we kind of have these little video mosh pit kind 
[03:14:30]  of things and, uh, hang out and we post it all on the site.  So that's cool.  And then, uh, the idea is when I get back to what I want to do this year, we're trying  to get a new sponsor for the site and, uh, which we're sort of about to do.  And then I want to actually start turning my house into a bit more of a multi show channel.  And when I'm on the road, I'm going to have other people host shows.  So there's a few people that have, you know, like Fred Durst has hosted a show from my house  a couple of times.  He does this character called Kirby Chitwood, where he plays this kind of sort of a mountain 
[03:15:00]  man type character and, uh, and takes phone calls.  And, uh, Norm MacDonald has said maybe he'd do it.  Rob Schneider might come up and host some shows.  So I want to sort of basically phone into my own living room from the road and have people  host.  How funny is Norm MacDonald?  Norm MacDonald is so fucking funny, man.  He's, he's my favorite.  You know, he's from-  Is he one of your favorites?  Yeah, he is.  He is.  Him and Harland Williams when I was a kid were my two favorite standups.  And they're both from Canada and Norm's from Ottawa.  And when I was sort of doing standup at Yuck Yucks when I was 15 years old, they were 
[03:15:30]  the headliners that were touring.  And we would just sort of, we would be there every time sort of waiting for them.  So now that's the coolest thing about, you know, doing the shows.  Now I didn't really get to know Norm until I started doing this show.  And, uh, you know, I just invite everybody up who I, who I love.  Where's he been?  And he's just doing, he's, he's doing standup.  He's doing a lot of standup right now and, uh, he's doing his thing.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  You, uh, you did Celebrity Apprentice with Dice.  How was that?  Cause, uh, you know, Dice got booted in the first episode.  Uh-huh. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  That was pretty hilarious actually doing Celebrity Apprentice.  I really enjoyed that.  Um, cause, uh, first of all, I didn't know Dice was going to be on the show until the day  of the show.  Really?  He didn't know he was going to be on the show until the day before they started shooting.  That's nice.  And they flew him in.  He was sort of, uh, they, they asked him at the last minute.  They flew him in and, uh, you know, I had, I, I was, I was going there really planning  to win this thing really was the whole goal.  I was going to, cause I was, I, I, I'd watched the show.  I like, I actually liked the show. 
[03:16:30]  I thought it was, you know, I think it's a funny show and, um, and I thought I'd be  kind of good at it, you know, just cause I'm, I'm pretty organized and, you know, uh, I  thought I'd be able to win the show.  So then I find out the first day Dice is on and I realized, okay, me, when me and Dice  get going, we'd sort of do this thing where I kind of play as straight man.  He's sort of, you know, razzing on me the whole time and it turns into this and we  really confuse everybody around us, you know, uh, or he does.  And I sort of make it worse by sort of playing into it.  So I knew as soon as I found out he was going to be on there that I was going to screw up 
[03:17:00]  my whole strategy, you know, cause I was all of a sudden in that sort of, you know, nutty  comedy mode.  And, uh, you know, so, uh, but the first, the funniest thing about that was, you know,  he was, you know, we started out in the, uh, the first episode was on the USS Intrepid and  the whole, the whole cast is there and, uh, Trump shows up on the helicopter and he comes  and he lands in his helicopter and the Intrepid and it's this very dramatic thing, right?  Of course.  He said something to Dice that pissed Dice off. 
[03:17:30]  He said, Hey, hello.  He said, Andrew, do you still like women?  He said, and that was all he said to Dice, right?  And then we went downstairs into the, uh, you know, the, what is it?  The, the whole, the bow of the ship, the belly of the ship and getting ready to go to  the boardroom where we would go to the boardroom and Dice was fuming really angry because he  just thought, you know, you know, what's Donald talking about?  You know, and he got really mad, started screaming at, uh, Mark Burnett, you know, about, about  this and, uh, we went to the, uh, we went to the boardroom and Trump came in and it was 
[03:18:00]  all very dramatic and everyone's sitting there and Dice just looks at Trump and he says, uh,  Donnie, how come there's no cream cheese, cream cheese in the green room here?  Oh, what's going on?  Donnie.  Yeah.  So it was pretty bizarre.  He got fired first episode.  First episode.  He fucks it up.  You're like, Dice, hang in there.  That's Dice.  But I got fired because I went out drinking with Dennis Rodman.  That's why I got fired.  Really?  Yeah.  The third episode, I was the project manager. 
[03:18:30]  I was getting screamed at the whole time by Clint Black, getting screamed at by Scott  Hamilton.  And, you know, it's such a bizarre thing, you know, cause they put all these, you know,  douchebags in a room together and everybody's sort of, you know, very much, I think, used  to being sort of the center of attention, I guess, in their own little world, you know, Clint  Black and Brian McKnight and Jesse James.  And everybody's not used to working with a group where, you know, everyone's not hanging 
[03:19:00]  on their every word.  And, you know, I was, I was the youngest guy in the guys team and, you know, probably, you  know, they probably thought that I was a, you know, a pushover or whatever.  So they really sort of came down on me.  It was just so annoying because their ideas didn't make any sense.  And I got really very frustrated with it.  And so I went out, you know, I was a project manager on the third episode.  I went out drinking with Dennis Rodman and cause he was, Dennis was the only guy that  was really kind of cool.  Everyone else was a jerk really on the guy's side. 
[03:19:30]  And Rodman was having fun.  And I thought, you know, and after, after pretty much two weeks of being sort of in this sort  of horrible situation with all these jerks kind of yelling at you, I was like, you know,  Rodman was like, let's go get a drink.  And I'm like, yeah, let's go get a drink.  And I was the project manager.  We ended up out at Penthouse Strip Club till about four in the morning.  And I woke, I overslept my alarm on the day of the big project manager thing, you know,  and Jesse James called me and woke me up. 
[03:20:00]  Get out of bed, asshole.  He says, you know, Jesse James was a bit of a jerk to me.  Who is Jesse James?  He's the guy who's married to Sandra Bullock, who was on the Monster Garage or whatever it's  called.  That fucking means nothing to me.  But, you know, so, so, you know, I kind of actually kind of, Dice said to me after he  got fired, though, he said, Tommy, you don't, you don't want to, you don't want to win  this thing.  You know, you know, he really, he really felt good about, you know, going out in a blaze 
[03:20:30]  of glory.  You don't want to win the battle of the douchebags.  I'd want to be in there for a few weeks at least.  I am the greatest douchebag.  Well, fuck, Tom, we could talk to you all day.  This is great.  But I think we've got to take a break and all that.  I appreciate you guys having me on.  This is awesome.  Let me say, you're playing comics, but I think this thing is going to have no problem selling  Thursday, two shows Friday, two shows Saturday.  Everybody come down.  Bring your video cameras.  We'll shoot some video after the show.  And we're selling t-shirts.  Nice.  Yeah, it's fun.  We hang out. 
[03:21:00]  I'm kind of really, we're really making like a punk rock tour, you know, after the show.  We go out, hang out, sell t-shirts, take pictures, goof off, have fun, and make some  fun videos.  That's cool.  And having a great time.  It's great to be back in New York City.  I mean, it's really, I mean.  And you had never been to comics, obviously.  It's a nice club.  Yeah.  It's a nice club.  They do a good job down there.  Yeah, the food is very good.  It's in a meatpacking district on 14th and 9th.  Exactly.  How come you don't have a flip cam?  You have a Canon.  We don't have flips, Tom.  Flip cams rule.  You know what?  The HD flip rules. 
[03:21:30]  I'm not, you know, I'm not to do an endorsement, but the thing I love about this is, okay,  this camera, okay, the flip cam, unless they've changed it, the flip cam doesn't have a card  that you can take out.  Right.  So you can shoot as much stuff as you want.  You never run out of memory.  It's a 32 gig card.  I'm going to shoot four and a half hours on this card.  Okay.  Isn't that amazing?  32 gigs on it.  Like, you think back a few years ago, what I needed for like one gig.  A gig would have ruled, right?  Oh, man, yeah.  It's just so exciting.  That's what's so exciting about video now.  I love it.  I love the Canon camera. 
[03:22:00]  It's actually smaller than the flip, I think, but, you know, flip's great too.  I don't know.  The flip just has a pretty good quality.  And I like it because people were taking reaction shots of me because everybody's been  asking me, hey, your stuff's on iTunes as of today.  So do you want to be flip cam?  And I'm like, I don't know if that's really appropriate.  Yeah.  It was a horrible ham-handed plug for your material.  I don't give a fuck about my CDs being on today.  Who cares?  They're not important.  iTunes.  Oh, okay.  First time ever.  Fuck iTunes.  I'd love you guys to come down if you can get down some.  I think I'm going to make it. 
[03:22:30]  I'm going to make one of the shows this week.  I'll be in San Francisco, but that's cool you're doing stand-up, man.  I never realized you did stand-up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wasn't doing it.  So, you know, now I'm really loving it, though.  So I plan on keep doing it for a long time.  So looking forward for you to come see what I'm doing, Jim.  It'd be cool.  Get some pointers.  Well, let's thank Tom Green, man.  We've got to take a break here.  I've got to piss desperately.  Absolutely.  TomGreen.com as well.  Let's make sure we get that plug out there.  Thanks, Tom.  Thanks, guys.  And tonight, by the way, tonight on Raw Dog from 5 to 6 p.m., Sirius 104, XM 150. 
[03:23:00]  Tom's doing an hour-long special show.  Yeah.  That's going to be good to check out.  That's tonight.  Oh, this isn't nice, Travis.  Oh, my God.  I'm a goner.  I'm a goner.  Doug Fiegel or Fieger?  Yeah.  How do you say his last name?  Doug Fieger?  Lead singer of the Knack dies of cancer over the weekend at the age of 57. 
[03:23:30]  Now, you've got to go.  My sarcoma.  Right?  No?  Wow.  Wow.  Hair falling off of me.  Falling off of me.  Oh, my God.  And the second hit by the Knack.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  They had My Sharona and that other song.  That was called Sloan Kettering? 
[03:24:00]  I don't know.  It's terrible.  Way to bypass the fun ant and go right for the hurtful stuff.  I know.  Ouch.  I took the shortcut.  Yeah.  We're trying to find, like, clever.  I know.  It goes right for the actual hospital name.  Yeah.  Why make it fit into a song?  Yeah.  You know, why make it clever?  Hey, what was that next song?  A sad family today? 
[03:24:30]  Open casket.  Jeez.  No, I don't think so.  That was the big C.  Hey, Valentine's Day made $56.4 million at the box office.  We told everyone not to go.  What?  They didn't listen to us.  Would have made $80 if we didn't say this.  That's a horrendous movie.  And you saw what?  Dear John?  Yeah, I was going to see it.  Why the fuck would you go see Dear John?  That's a chick flick.  Fag.  I was given the choice of either Dear John or Valentine's Day.  Why couldn't you say, hey, how about I give you a fucking choice?  Well, because I make her go to my movies a lot. 
[03:25:00]  And it was the day after Valentine's Day.  And I was like, this would be a nice thing to do for me.  To go and take her to one of her movies.  That's a nice thing for me to do.  What is Dear John about?  It's a goofy, the guy goes to war, he falls in love while he's on leave.  Except it starts in the spring of 2001.  So then September comes and it's 9-11.  And then he re-enlists.  What happens then?  He dies.  I'm not going to tell you the ending in case some of our fans want to go see it.  Did you like it?  No.  No, it was actually, even Jess thought it was terrible. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, you went with Jess?  Yes.  I love how you said that.  That means she has horrible movie taste, right?  Well, no, because she went because she knew what it was.  It was a chick flick.  But even for a chick flick, it was like, the ending of this movie, they just stopped writing  a point.  Yeah.  And just threw in a scene and some credits.  Well, they didn't need it.  It's a stupid chick flick.  They could do a little writing.  No.  What happened to The Wolfman?  The Wolfman was in second place. 
[03:26:00]  I don't know.  But that's getting, what, shaky reviews, right?  Yeah.  Benicio Del Toro.  The Wolfman.  And Avatar's still fucking rocking.  Jesus, another 23 and a half million.  That's about ready to leave the fucking theater.  So why don't you guys get your damn 3D classes.  I want to go next week.  I have to go early next week.  And get an IMAX experience in.  I'll go next Tuesday.  How about we do that?  I didn't hear a word of that.  I don't know. 
[03:26:30]  I don't know what he's saying.  That's pig Latin or something.  And the song was Good Girls Don't.  Okay.  Good Girls Don't.  But I do.  I'm sure we can figure out something clever for that, but I'm done.  Yeah, we're just about done for today.  Hey, Family Guy, though.  Let's play this clip.  I guess Stewie takes a girl with Down syndrome out on a date. 
[03:27:00]  Or Brian.  Brian, not Stewie.  Brian.  That was Brian.  That was my mistake, not yours.  I didn't see Family Guy.  This was yesterday?  Yeah, I think so.  I got DVR'd.  I'll check it out today.  In between Olympic hockey and curling.  Curling?  I think you should ask Tom Green about curling.  But he knows a lot.  I went with the Olympics.  He wasn't going with it.  So we moved on to other things.  Here's the clip from last night.  Well, I'm glad we're finally going out, Ellen.  I've really liked you for a long time. 
[03:27:30]  Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing?  Sitting down?  Get up and put my chair out for me.  Oh, goodness.  I'm sorry.  If you see the clip, they really drew a Down syndrome character.  What's wrong with them?  They did.  They actually drew a Down syndrome character.  Yes, of course they do.  And because they're attacking Palin.  Yeah, yeah.  That's true.  Yeah, that's true.  Look, see?  It's very Down syndrome-y. 
[03:28:00]  Although the hair should have been more Mo.  Yeah.  Pete Rose.  Pete Rose. </pre>
