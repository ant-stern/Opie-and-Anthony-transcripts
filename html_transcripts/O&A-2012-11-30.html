<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with anticipation for a phone call with Joe Piscopo, following a previous awkward on-air appearance.  The hosts compared this experience to a past uncomfortable encounter with Ray Liotta and critiqued the editing of Piscopo's comedy special. The conversation then veered towards the hosts' food experiences, specifically a visit from Meatball Obsessions, leading to graphic discussions about digestion and various meats, including venison and buffalo.  One host detailed a skin cancer scare and subsequent medical examination, sparking a lengthy and explicit conversation about the process, including body odor and genitalia.  A caller further contributed to this discussion with their own mole removal story. The hosts also briefly touched upon Bobo’s attempted Christmas song performance, Paddy's successful Christmas performance video, and their plans to see *The Hobbit*. This segued into a discussion of Martin Freeman and *The Office* (UK).

The show then transitioned to the Hostess bankruptcy and the outrage over executive bonuses amidst employee layoffs.  They reminisced about a past segment with Ralphie May, highlighting funny clips, and touched upon the rumored retirement of Imus, the high suicide rate among radio personalities, a story about a kind police officer, previous pranks involving a homeless man and cake, and the street performers in Times Square.  Meatball Obsessions was mentioned as a sponsor.

The next segment criticized a company's policy requiring office attendance even during colleagues' vacations.  This led to a highly critical and vulgar discussion of Lindsay Lohan, her legal troubles, alleged assault, lack of accountability, and a negative personal anecdote involving her refusal to take a photo with a child, with the hosts calling her "cunty" and also criticizing her father.  The hosts then discussed the upcoming appearance of Steven Singer, a jewelry advertiser, and anticipated his attractive assistant's arrival, expressing disappointment and making crude jokes about Singer's appearance when she was absent.  They comically noted Singer had however, brought "Mr. Beano," a nickname for his penis.

A listener's darkly humorous rendition of "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer" followed, transitioning to discussion of *The Hobbit*, Joe Piscopo's upcoming appearance, one host's experience removing rings from his pregnant wife's finger, “push presents,” and complaints about sponsor gifts, including a bizarre fan gift of their names spelled out in raw chicken.  A substantial portion focused on Mayor Thomas Menino's hospitalization and rehab, including playing a clip of his press conference downplaying his condition and speculating about his future.  The segment concluded with a discussion about Prince Harry's alleged parentage, examining photos comparing him to James Hewitt, and a clip of the Amazing Randy discussing his debunking of faith healing.

The following segment opened with comments on a video of young Asian women, then shifted to horse riding and a promotional segment for a jingle contest.  This was followed by a comedic audio segment, "America's Got Genitals," a parody of "America's Got Talent."  Steven Singer arrived in studio, leading to a discussion of donuts, his diabetes, his jewelry business, a funny anecdote about repairing a damaged ring, marriage, and the questionable practices of some jewelers.  A significant portion involved judging the O&A jingle contest, interspersed with conversations with Singer, including complaints about the studio and management.  Singer ultimately selected a winner, receiving payment for their contribution.

The final excerpt featured the conclusion of the jingle contest judging, with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton using highly offensive and vulgar language to describe the entries.  A phone call with Joe Piscopo followed, with explicit discussions about his divorce, personal life, and impromptu performances of a Sinatra-inspired song and an Arnold Schwarzenegger impression, ending abruptly due to technical difficulties.  Steven Singer remained present in studio. The show concluded with a promotional announcement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Friday, Friday, Friday!  Is that song still popular?  Um, still.  Oh boy, Joe Piscopo, huh?  Oh, wait, what?  A lot of people talking about the Joe Piscopo from yesterday.  Oh my god.  He's calling into it.  Yes, he is.  Yes, stay tuned, people, because we are getting a phone call  from the one and only Joe Piscopo, who called, I guess, Roland. 
[00:00:30]  Yesterday, personally, and I was inquiring about an appearance on this very program.  I saw his Twitter yesterday, because I noticed a few people were tweeting him,  and us attached, and commenting on what they had heard yesterday.  In a good way?  Oh, no.  No, huh?  And so I was like, alright, let me click on Joe Piscopo's Twitter,  and click follow, which I did.  Within five minutes, I got a DM from Joe Piscopo saying, 
[00:01:00]  Anthony, is this really you?  There's a lot of clutter here.  I miss you guys.  And to which I threw my phone down and didn't look at it for the rest of the night  out of fear and embarrassment.  Fear and embarrassment.  It was terrible.  Can I tell you the truest thing you ever said was by Sarah Jessica Parker?  Yeah.  When she said, you forget that there's a real person attached to it. 
[00:01:30]  Yes.  Remember that.  Oh.  Oops.  So, we'll have fun with Joe Piscopo today.  Yeah.  You know, we got to talk to him, I guess.  Yeah, of course.  After yesterday.  What a weird week, because we messed with Ralphie, Ralphie May.  Yes.  And then he calls.  We squared it with him.  And now we've messed with Joe Piscopo, and he's calling today.  He's going to call today.  And he misses us.  He misses us.  He never did us wrong.  No.  And every time he pops in, he's happy, energetic, and ready to go. 
[00:02:00]  Very charitable guy, I mean.  His Sinatra is terrific, I've got to tell you that much.  I don't know why you guys didn't dig this special.  I enjoyed it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He tweeted on Opie and Anthony tomorrow, 9 a.m.  Meaning today, obviously.  Ask and you shall receive.  I guess he asked, and he received.  No, the fans asked.  Oh.  So, he goes, ask and you shall receive.  It was.  Why was this guy delusional?  It was like him getting a lot of tweets from people. 
[00:02:30]  Saying, hey, you should be on O&A.  Were the tweets good, Sam?  They must have been good, right?  There was already, like, even after he wrote that,  ask and you shall receive.  Yeah.  Somebody quoted him and then wrote, I am already uncomfortable.  Oh, boy.  Uncomfortable is the word that best fits that segment.  I was reading a lot of tweets as the replay went on and after people listened to that segment.  Yeah.  And uncomfortable was the key word. 
[00:03:00]  We could pretty much replay that entire bit this weekend.  It went on a little long, but I told Ann before the show, it's very, very rare that I get very uncomfortable in here.  Yeah.  Ray Liotta did it to me once.  Oh, people ask me about that.  No, I wasn't uncomfortable this time.  No, Ray was great.  But the first time he came in, yeah, I was really uncomfortable and intimidated by the guy.  Yeah.  It doesn't happen a lot.  It's pretty cool.  But I told Ann yesterday, it was a lot of fun, but it went from, you know, getting extremely uncomfortable, which is rare for me. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And then I felt sorry for the guy.  And then I kind of just got depressed.  There were a lot of different emotions there.  That was a very, yeah, yeah, emotion-laden segment.  But I just feel like he fucked up his special.  Yeah.  Yeah, the editing was horrendous.  Like, you know, they showed all the times he was uncomfortable on that stage, and you could edit that.  You could take care of that in post, as they call it. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  You know, the, oh, I was just saying, and anyway, and all that, all those nervous little tics.  Yeah, the nervous little, like.  When you know something's not working.  And he goes, you know, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, like all that should have just been ripped right out of there.  Punchline, you cut away to an audience member.  You'll find him.  Yeah.  You'll find him.  Yeah, whatever.  So he'll be calling in today at 9 o'clock.  Nice.  All right.  Looking forward to it.  I want to thank Meatball Obsession.  Oh, my God.  Or is it Obsessions? 
[00:04:30]  Obsessions, they were in here yesterday doing a little plugolo, which was nice.  And I've been shitting meatballs ever since, so I want to thank that guy.  They were so good.  I ate them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Wow.  That's all I ate yesterday.  That's crazy.  I had one bite.  It was amazing.  That and a juice from my favorite juice place.  Oh, of course.  A vegetable juice.  Meatballs and a vegetable juice?  A vegetable juice.  That's a good dinner right there.  What's that like coming out?  It looks like you got ass cancer, if you need to know. 
[00:05:00]  And when you do some of these vegetable juices and you forget, then you do your thing in the  morning.  It scares you.  You look at the toilet, you think you have ass cancer.  You got all scared?  God forbid, because I know people suffer from that.  Oh, my God.  No, because the whole thing turns red from the beet juice.  From the beet juice.  Right, right.  I ate much too much yesterday.  I was just like, ugh.  I ate those fucking meatballs yesterday in here like crazy.  They're good.  After my sandwich.  Yeah.  I went home and, well, I stayed in the city and then I went out to dinner last night, ate 
[00:05:30]  too much, and then on the way back to the apartment, it was a good idea to stop at  the deli and grab some beef jerky.  What?  I love beef jerky.  Do you really?  That's your thing?  Oh, fucking just sitting there with a beer and beef jerky.  What kind?  I like teriyaki.  Does a teriyaki one?  Yeah.  Because they've gotten out of control with the beef jerky.  I know that much.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was never really a fan.  Oh, do I love a good jerky?  When I was living in western New York, they used to make homemade beef jerky. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, with the deer.  The deer meat.  Oh, some venison jerky.  Yes.  Homemade venison.  They called it beef jerky, even though it was venison, I guess.  Yeah.  It was all right.  They would smoke that shit.  You didn't eat a lot of venison, right?  No, not a big fan of the venison.  When you're in an area where they hunt a lot, you can't avoid it.  Venison chili that tastes a little gamey and greasy if it's not done right.  That's what it is.  Yeah, I'm not a fan of that. 
[00:06:30]  I've had venison where it's really good, and then others that think they know what they're  doing.  You go to their house, and a deer's just hanging in their fucking garage.  They're bleeding it out.  Throat slit like a serial killer.  It's still breathing.  Right.  Tomorrow, we're going to make chili for the Bills game.  Great.  Everyone gets excited, and then you can just see the layer of gamey grease on top.  Oh, my God.  God, no, you soak that up with your bread.  Not me, man.  I bet you Ted Nugent knows how to make venison well.  He eats a lot of that shit. 
[00:07:00]  He probably makes it well, him and his wife.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think we've figured it out.  Chicken is delicious.  Beef is delicious.  Yeah.  People try to make venison delicious.  It's, like I said, I've had it where it's all right.  Yeah, we got the good taste.  That buffalo burger, where it's the buffalo, no, I don't think so.  I don't think there's enough fat in buffalo.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, that lean choppy.  Choppy that's too lean.  You need a belly hanging off the animal.  Yeah, you need some fat. 
[00:07:30]  To show that they're a little lazy.  A nice marbling, like E-Rock.  E-Rock would be tasty.  A nice marbled slice of meat.  Yeah.  Yeah, we make fun of him, but if the shit's going down, he's going to feel as well.  Oh, he's the first one that fucking goes.  His throat slit hanging up in the garage.  Zombies are attacking.  We'll be somewhere going, you know what?  E-Rock's delicious.  E-Rock's delicious.  God, let's ration this, because this shit is good.  Some E-Rock bacon. 
[00:08:00]  Ah, the fucking meatballs.  Yeah, that was good shit, though, man.  We rode down the elevator with him.  He's just fucking spouting off about his meatballs.  Right, we get it.  They're delicious.  And I went to the skin doctor again yesterday.  Oh.  And I got to thank Tom Chiasano, who had a major bout with skin cancer.  Ooh.  He was checking out at one point, years ago, and he survived, big time.  He's a survivor.  And he used to talk to me about it when we worked with him. 
[00:08:30]  Tom Chiasano was a fucking stand-up guy.  I liked him a lot.  I really did.  And there was no reason for him to like us, but he did.  And I respect that a lot, because, you know, he worked for the other guy and all that.  And he was forced to work with us and all that at first.  But he had an open mind and really appreciated what we did and just was a stand-up guy.  He was management, so we had our issues, obviously.  But I respect him on so many levels.  Anyway, because of his skin cancer, I started going to the skin doctor.  And I got fucking pre-pre-skin cancer. 
[00:09:00]  Wow.  And I had more of it fucking burned off my hands last night.  Jiminy Cricket.  Yeah.  But if you go early, and this is the speech I'm making today,  you could take care of this shit.  My problem is all those years caddying.  Caddy.  I was telling my skin doctor yesterday, like, when you walk down a golf course as a caddy,  you present your hands to the sun.  Because this is how you carry golf bags.  You put your hands on top of the woods.  It makes it easier to carry the bags. 
[00:09:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Uh-huh.  So you're through the strap, and then you kind of...  Like this?  Yes.  I'm showing you.  Oh, boy.  So you're just...  Your hands are out in front like Frankenstein.  Yeah, your hands are just baking day after day, and especially back then.  No one put lotion on their hands.  You might put it on your face or the back of your neck, but...  Be a man.  Never on your hands.  Why would you do that?  You would look like a girl lotioning up your fucking hands, right?  So that's my problem area.  But they're catching it nice and early, over and over again.  And she's like, don't even fucking worry about it. 
[00:10:00]  As long as you keep coming in and stuff, and we're on top of it, you'll be fine.  And it's the other skin cancer, I guess, which is not as dangerous as the moles.  Oh, boy.  You got to check those moles.  I don't want to go to the doctor.  Why?  No reason.  I'm just thinking of fucking...  I'm a mole-y boy.  Are you a mole-y little boy?  Mole-y.  Well, my point is this.  My skin doctor is really hot.  Give me his name. 
[00:10:30]  That old gag.  I love it.  And I took pleasure in a sick way.  Like, you know, you sit here for five hours a day, more or less.  You know, I mean, we're on four.  Sometimes a little less than four.  During a change.  We are sitting for about five.  And then I decided to walk to the skin doctor, which was a long walk all the way across Central Park and all that.  Yeah.  So I was a bit gamey.  Oh, no.  And sweaty.  Oh, no.  And I took great pleasure in the fact that I had my full body checked yesterday. 
[00:11:00]  And she actually has to lift up my onion bag to check for skin cancer.  And she's hot.  And your balls stunk.  I would have to say they did.  Yes.  Yes.  What, were you sunning your taint back in the day?  Yeah, exactly.  Should have seen how he carried that third bag.  Yeah.  Where he put the putter.  But I think you're.  The old smelly putter.  But I think if you're a disgusting fat body.  Yeah.  You're not getting the ball lift. 
[00:11:30]  That's my theory.  So I'm thinking that I'm doing all right still.  Because I'm thinking if I was a messy slob, she's not fucking lifting your ball bag.  That's true.  I think she's only lifting the ball bag of the guy she kind of finds.  All right, guys.  All right.  Is it very technical?  Is it keeping it together?  When she lifts it up, or does she brush against your cock, too, a little bit with the hand?  Well, the beauty is you keep your underpants on.  She goes right from your toes all the way to your head.  And then she starts, like, going up the leg, and you know it's coming.  And then she pulls down your underpants. 
[00:12:00]  What if you have a rod?  Do you get plumped up at all?  Nah, man.  In those situations, I've always been able to keep it under control.  But do you have to keep it under control, or would you be able to just rod out at some point?  Then what do you do?  I know, right?  Then you look like—I always feel like you just look like a complete asshole.  So I just make sure, like, that's not going to happen.  I mean, it's got good presentation.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to have a good presentation.  But like we've discussed on this show, you could go a little too far where the girls know, 
[00:12:30]  all right, that's not good presentation, asshole.  You've got to plump it up.  You've got to make it look like that's you just on an average day, just pulling your pants down.  But then one little pump of blood too much, and it looks like, all right, you're getting a hard on.  It's a fine line between a good presentation and you're a fucking creep.  You're trying to make believe this is you, but you've got a semi, you asshole.  Don't let it—don't plump it where you're like—you know, you have a tight end up and you're like— 
[00:13:00]  It could twitch.  Yeah, it's like the fucking—the hat tip.  The tip of the hat.  How do you do?  How do you do?  Hey, partner.  Yeah, you don't want it to twitch.  You just want it to kind of hang there, plumped up, but still look like it's got some gravity curve to it.  Yeah.  Once it starts sticking straight out a little bit.  Straight out.  It can't be pushed forward at all from your body.  Right, right, right.  It's just—there's a fine line.  Ladies, you have no idea what a chore it is to own one of these. 
[00:13:30]  So I feel like I'm doing all right still if the hot skin doctor definitely went for make sure the ball bag's okay.  Yeah.  I assume on a lot of people she just ignores that, like, ah, what are the odds?  So get your stupid skin checked.  That's my public service announcement today.  A little PSA.  Me for my stupid caddying days.  Oh, Jesus.  But they don't tell you because I've been walking away from that office. 
[00:14:00]  I've been doing this for a couple years now, since Tom Chiasano.  So how many years is that?  Three years maybe?  Four years?  Yeah.  And, you know, they go, oh, that's pre-pre.  So then I go home, like, oh, my God, what the fuck?  And I finally asked them yesterday.  I go, look, this pre-pre that you're burning off today, I go, if I just let that go two years, what's the deal?  She goes, oh, we would have to probably, you know, cut it out, but you would be fine.  I'm like, really?  Oh, Jesus.  I'm thinking pre-pre means, you know, here comes the pre.  You fast forward and you see yourself in a horrible situation.  You know what I mean? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  But still, you got to, like, make sure, I guess.  Yeah, I think I'm talking about shit.  This guy has moles on both sides of his ball bag.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I got to take this call.  Savage animal in Rockland.  Go ahead, sir.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, on my inner thigh, on both sides of my fucking ball, and I heard the doctor out in the hallway going, oh, she'll take it off.  She was arguing with her staff which one of them was going to remove it from my inner thigh. 
[00:15:00]  They didn't want to.  And you're in the room?  I was in the room and they were out in the hallway.  Jesus.  Oh.  That's funny, man.  That's sad, I guess.  Somebody stole my wallet.  I'm a little out of shape.  I'm not a fucking 400-pound man.  Come on.  Right.  I think, and this office they go to, there's a bunch of really good-looking, you know, women.  Yeah.  And there's always a different assistant when I'm there. 
[00:15:30]  So I think they just, they really have a good time with the body checks.  They get to see Cac.  I'm sorry, Hope.  I didn't mean to go.  No, I don't care.  It was just a dumb thing anyway.  In this office, there were nothing before.  There's not one of them with Cac.  It's like, who the fuck are you to argue?  Yeah.  All right, Savage Animal.  Thank you, sir.  All right, buddy.  All right.  Oh, God.  What happened? 
[00:16:00]  No, nothing.  Oh.  I was just contemplating.  I mean, I could talk about skin, you know, skin shit for another 20 minutes if you want.  I think you did an all right job on the public service announcement.  You want to move on?  Because I have a few more stories.  I don't know about, we talked about this in the past about going to the doctor and showering beforehand.  Like, I don't know about the walk, the long, sweaty walk to the doctor when they got to do some kind, you know, maybe if he's just checking a sore throat or something. 
[00:16:30]  Well, she checks your hiney, too.  So she goes, all right, turn over.  And I'm like, oh, God, why didn't I?  She spread them?  She didn't spread, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Got to get right in there, though, right?  Oh, Jesus.  You never know where those cancer cells might be hiding.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's what she said to her.  Oh.  Yeah, but it's just weird, though.  Fucking the stench emanating.  Is there a sweat stench?  Don't you feel kind of vulnerable if you're on your belly when a doctor, like when I'm like laying on my back, like, yeah, check whatever the fuck you want. 
[00:17:00]  But then when you roll over, it seems a little.  Yeah.  Don't you hate when they always say, look, you don't have to hold your buttocks open for us.  We don't have to.  Well, I just wanted to make sure.  Yeah, I just want to make sure you got in there good and deep.  I want to make sure you can check properly.  Do ladies even have a clue how good that is to a guy when they reach down and first grab that fucking cock of yours?  I would imagine.  It's fucking great, ladies. 
[00:17:30]  Thank you.  Thanks for that.  I think they appreciate it good.  That fucking, that first fucking, bah, where they just grabbed that thing.  I got to ask my in-laws.  Wonderful.  I got to ask my in-laws, when do they listen exactly?  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  You just tell them it's for the show.  For the show.  For the show.  I said that for the, for the show.  It's for the show.  I know they, like, make coffee right around now, and I know that radio's on, and they're listening to us, so.  I got to figure out where the window is where we can, you know, get some of the dirty stuff done. 
[00:18:00]  The filth-ridden shit?  Yeah.  By the way, with Bobo, did you see Bobo, well, you, you blocked Bobo.  Oh, God, no.  Don't even bring it up.  I saw his tweet.  No, it was, uh, the fact that he wanted to make it sound like it was so spontaneous, his idea.  Right.  Was to come in and sing a Christmas song.  Yesterday, of course, because Paddy came in and did it.  He thinks that's the way to get on the show.  Yeah, yeah, I read that. 
[00:18:30]  I'm like, oh, God.  You, uh, you killed it during the Stalker Paddy Christmas song, and, uh, we have the video.  I'm going to put it up, uh, actually, it's, it's on private right now.  I just got to make it.  Paddy was, uh, great yesterday.  I just got to make it public on my YouTube channel, Opio Radio, but Anthony fucking just, uh, see, it's right here.  Ooh.  But no one can see it yet.  Oh.  Paddy.  You fucking killed it yesterday, so.  That was a pisser.  Or singing her dumb songs.  I'll try to make that public during the break, but, um, there you go.  Paddy.  So, anyway, um, uh, the skin doctor.  Well, that's all I have today. 
[00:19:00]  Skin doctor and shitting meatballs.  Yeah.  It's a fucking packed day after the show.  Oh, yes.  And my nephew, who's almost taller than me, at fucking 13 years old, I'm taking him to see The Hobbit today.  Oh, yeah, you're going to that, uh.  Going to the big screening.  The big screening, huh?  And, uh, my nephew and my, uh, brother, he's going, too.  They're both rolling their eyes.  They're like, oh, did you read The Hobbit?  And I'm like, uh, no.  And they're rolling their eyes, like, oh.  Because they're, like, they're, like, super geeks about it. 
[00:19:30]  Well, we still like it if we haven't seen, like, I don't know anything about it.  Those movies stand on their own.  They all do.  I've never seen it.  You didn't see the Lord of the Rings movies?  No, I don't know anything about it.  Dude.  My friend Cameron in high school read this stuff.  He was the guy who was into The Hobbit.  And that's the only memory I have of The Hobbit is Cameron Vibrock talking about The Hobbit.  Well, The Hobbit takes place before Lord of the Rings, obviously.  So you don't have to read anything.  But the Lord of the Rings movies are amazing.  I recognize Gollum in the trailers.  I know he was in the later ones, right?  I never read a word of those books, but the movies were great. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  And I'm not a big fucking over-the-top action guy, action movie guy, but I loved the battles.  Yeah, they were really good.  It was amazing.  Does it still hold up?  Has anyone seen it?  Because it's been almost 10 years at this point, right?  Yeah, I know.  Fuck.  I saw Return of the King recently, and I mean, there's a little hokey parts in there, but  for the most part, it's still...  No, I mean the CGI or whatever.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The CGI looks good.  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  That's what I'm wondering about.  Yeah, they get those massive battle things going on, and it looks pretty good. 
[00:20:30]  I'm looking forward to it, and we're lucky we get to go to a screening room.  A screening?  The movie itself is two hours and 40 minutes, but then in a regular theater, now you've  got to throw in the almost half hour of fucking previews.  Is it that high frame rate version?  Yeah, that's where I'm going today.  You're going to the high frame rate?  Yep.  Let me know what that looks like.  I will.  Are people bitching about it?  Or is it bitching?  I don't know.  We'll see.  I think they know what they're doing, so I think it's going to be great.  I would assume.  It's a nice early screening. 
[00:21:00]  You going, Jimmy?  Yes, I want to.  Let's do this.  I got red eye tonight.  Are you doing red eye?  Yes.  Yeah, they offered me that, but I said, I want to do this.  They did not.  We have Martin Freeman coming in next week.  Morgan Freeman?  This is going to be...  No, this is Martin Freeman.  Oh, who's Martin Freeman?  Your cousin Martin Freeman?  Yeah.  He was Tim in the British office.  He's coming in?  Yeah.  Wow, that's cool. 
[00:21:30]  I'm very, very psyched to meet him.  What is he working on?  He's the Hobbit.  He's the Hobbit guy.  I don't know.  He's Bilbo Baggins.  He sits there under a mushroom, and all of a sudden, Hobbit Brent comes in.  Wait.  Oy.  Oy, Gollum.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  I don't recognize him at all.  Oh, yeah.  That's the guy from the office, the English office.  It's amazing.  Wait, can you show him in the English office? 
[00:22:00]  Why can't I make the connection?  Oh, dude, he was amazing.  No, I love the English office.  He was the one who had the crush with Dawn, the girl behind the counter.  Oh, my God.  That's the same guy.  That guy.  Wow.  That guy.  I love his faces.  Holy fuck.  When the computer tech is talking to fucking...  Oh, my God.  Gareth.  What's his name?  Gareth.  And his face is in the background, where he's just calling him out on his utter and complete bullshit.  The guy's lying about driving a race car.  Yeah.  And it's one of the greatest fucking horse's ass. 
[00:22:30]  Because the guy is just lying about how well he drives his car at the racetrack.  And how amazed everyone was at his driving, and how he just, eh, don't worry about it.  I know what I'm doing.  It was something about, like, you know, I'm driving it, and it flipped over, and they're  all, like, you should have died.  And I'm looking at them, like, what are you worried about?  But it was such a perfect...  That's exactly how a guy tells a lie.  Tells a complete lie.  Not knowing that everyone knows he's lying.  Except Gareth.  Yeah, except Gareth, who was buying it, though.  Monday's gonna be great. 
[00:23:00]  Is he in Monday or Tuesday?  Didn't you just say Monday?  No, next week.  I don't know what day.  Oh, Tuesday?  It is Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Because Monday, there's a screening, too.  We'll get to talk about The Hobbit and the English Office.  That's great.  Wouldn't it be funny if he screamed at us?  I don't talk about that show.  Yeah.  Knock it off.  Don't talk about that.  He was in something else recently, too.  Some other big movie I saw.  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  I don't remember.  I can remember him walking on a street.  That's not helpful at all.  That really clears things up. 
[00:23:30]  I just looked down to see what, you know, some of the shit we can do today.  And this pops up.  Hostess, is this true?  I didn't get to read a lot of stories this morning.  Hostess asked for approval to give top executives 1.8 million in bonuses.  Right.  Is that true?  If it is, I mean, it probably...  10,000 people are going to be unemployed, right?  18,000 to 19,000 people?  That's the fuck you to the union, by the way.  That's their, hey, go fuck yourself.  You negotiated yourself out of jobs. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  And here's what our fucking contracts say we get.  But this is literally...  Planning to ask for a judge's approval.  Instead of giving that to workers, like, that's...  In this moment, because they said that they had been doing that the last couple of years,  which maybe they already saw the writing on the wall, but that's why, in that moment,  like, that's what is fucking so disgusting about upper people in business.  That's what unions are saying, too.  But these guys are just unreasonable.  I think the union, in a way, could have, you know, pretty much fucked up a little bit there, too, obviously. 
[00:24:30]  But this is...  I think both sides have been very greedy, and it's culminated in people being out of work and company going down the shitter.  But it says, top executives' bonuses totaling up to $1.8 million as part of its wind-down plans.  Yeah, because that's how they said the incentive pay is needed to retain the 19 managers during the liquidation process,  which could take about a year.  I guess they need these guys' help.  The same people, I guess, that couldn't make the company work, or these 19 people, they need help liquidating. 
[00:25:00]  Give it to a fucking lawyer.  How do you need their help?  How hard is it to make a Twinkie?  Yeah, if you don't give them the money, they go elsewhere.  They say, fuck you, I'm leaving, I'll get a gig somewhere else.  Two of those executives would be eligible for additional rewards, depending on how efficiently they carry out the liquidation.  There you go.  Wow, what greedy fucking cocksuckers.  What greedy...  And I mean that level of management. 
[00:25:30]  By the way, that's business as usual.  But that to me is like, there's no justifiable explanation for that, where that's right.  I guess they, in their mind, it's the only thing they can do to keep those employees there to wind down, as they say,  without them just saying, fuck this, I need to, you know, I need to keep my boat payment up, so I'm going to get another gig.  And it's for 19 guys?  19, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  So wouldn't that be about, what, almost 100 G's per guy?  Is that what it comes down to?  Something like that, yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Ah, what are you going to do?  Now, is that bonus pay, or is that just additional pay?  It's probably boner pay.  It's probably boner pay.  There you go.  Big fat boner.  Boner.  I'm sure that's on top of what they're making already.  Did you ever think...  Although 100,000 is not that much.  Did you ever think at this age you'd still be saying boner?  No.  It's hilarious to me that, like, when I was in fucking fifth grade laughing with my friends saying boner, 
[00:26:30]  that in 2012 I would still be laughing saying boner.  I have a tough time hanging out with people my own age because I am so fucking immature because of what we do.  Oh, am I a fucking baby?  I tried to have a adult in conversations with my friends.  No.  I just want to talk about fucking boners.  And doody. 
[00:27:00]  How did this happen?  I don't know.  Holy shit, that's not right.  This isn't like the people my age I see in movies.  Doody is hilarious.  It's fucking hilarious.  It's always funny.  And then you always, like, someone tries to, like, tell you they're cool, too.  Yeah.  And you find out right away they're just not.  They're horrified by you immediately.  I know.  But it's just dumb things.  That thing you consider cool.  Like, someone tries to say they're cool, too.  Like, they'll talk about doody, but then they won't.  You're scoffed at my doody talk. 
[00:27:30]  You're not cool.  I can handle a good joke or two, can you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That you can.  I was very sad during the Ralphie May call, because I like Ralphie, but I laughed a lot.  There was some of those clips made me laugh so hard that I almost, I think I did start  crying, but I was literally from laughing, and there was, which one did, oh, you hit  one that fucking had me howling.  I remember which one you hit, but you hit one howling.  Nice.  Yeah, but I know. 
[00:28:00]  Was it the tornado shit?  Everyone grab a limb when the tornado was coming.  It was terrible.  No, it was pretty early on.  I think I remember it, too.  God.  I was thinking of both.  It was a succession of clips.  Now I need to know.  You started it.  I remember the ones Ann hit, but he hit them after.  I can't remember the one you hit.  God, I need to know now.  Oh, man.  People trying to fucking, you know, fuck, they're trying that hate shit with the Ralph  and May stuff.  You have no idea how cool I am with Ralph and May. 
[00:28:30]  Ralphie's fine, man.  But it was a good try.  I'll give you an A for effort on that one.  We're totally good with Ralph and May.  We actually turned it around with the guy.  We would absolutely have him on now.  Have him back on the show now.  Right.  Yeah, because now it's like a fucking, now he wouldn't, first of all, do what he did  that I said it was interruptive of the show.  No.  And if he did, it would become something now we can just jump on, so now everything's  cool.  But I like, I enjoyed hearing him talk about the other stuff, too.  Yeah, that was a fucking great, it was one of his best appearances. 
[00:29:00]  Well, as a guy who's, you know, he's an obese guy, and it's interesting to hear him  talking about what caused all that.  Like, I'm happy that he went to rehab and stuff.  Yeah.  Next time he's in New York, he'll come in here and we'll talk about that stuff.  Yeah.  You know, at length.  Yeah.  We'll have a pretty serious conversation about that, because that is fascinating.  Oh, what would it?  It's going to drive me nuts, because I was thinking for the rest of the day about those  moments, and just had giggling to myself.  Well, it's going to drive me nuts, because I need to know I'm funny, Jimmy, so please.  Dude, it really made me laugh.  When it comes to your head, please let me know. 
[00:29:30]  I'll have a skip in my step-tail as I go to the Hobbit.  See, I am funny, I am funny.  What the fuck was it?  Oh, it's evil Imus today.  He's got the black cowboy hat on and the dark suit.  Keith Richards understands that you need to wear the black hat.  No one else saw the fucking documentary.  I keep referring to the black hat.  Imus needs that hat now, because when he doesn't wear the hat, his hair's getting this poofy  old grandma consistency to it. 
[00:30:00]  There's a rumor going around that he might be retiring.  Really?  I want to ask Rob Bartlett.  Yeah, I don't know if he'll tell us.  I'll retire back out of my room.  Supposedly his contract is up right around now, and there's rumors that he might retire,  but that might just be negotiations.  What fucking radio people retire?  Let's be honest here.  I've heard rumor.  I think there's been more rumors over the years of radio guys that are going to retire.  They never fucking retire. 
[00:30:30]  They either work until they die, or they get fired to the point no one wants them anymore.  You're right.  They never leave on their own fucking accord.  There's no retirement home for radio guys.  No.  You're right.  They just keep fucking signing deals until they, like you said, either die or fucking  just get pushed out of the business by other people.  It's rare anyone gets to, you know, actually retire from their business.  Yeah, because it's such a fucking tits gig.  Well, it's an easy gig.  It's a gig, yeah.  You just sit here and babble about duty and boners. 
[00:31:00]  You get slapped around by companies and management and get fired, fired, fired, fired, fired.  Yep.  Then eventually, you know, a lot of these guys end up killing themselves, too.  Do they really?  Oh, yeah.  Radio guys do.  Oh, yeah.  Either, you know, drink themselves to death or actually.  Oh, like that.  Or literally.  Yeah, there's a couple stories out there that are sad.  And someone told me one where a guy put his head on the fucking railroad tracks.  Holy shit.  And they pretty much say it's because, you know, the business fucking finally got to  them.  What a way to go. 
[00:31:30]  Open casket?  Solid dude, too.  Wow, small.  Solid guy.  Smart guy.  Not as solid as that train.  Jesus.  It's terrible.  I'm keeping it vague, but solid dude.  That one came in recently from one of my radio guys.  Yikes.  Yeah.  I know.  Because all the jobs are going away, man.  And these guys are like, what the fuck do I do now?  Yeah.  And they don't have, like, money to retire on.  I knew a guy who, he worked, he's from the Midwest, and he fucking worked in a bunch  of stations.  And then he came back. 
[00:32:00]  He was, like, cheating on his wife, and he came back.  And he tried to get back with her.  He was going to open a record store, but she was with somebody else.  He worked for WOLD.  I knew he was going somewhere.  Of course.  I feel so stupid, because I'm looking at him seriously, and then I start going, like,  oh, no, he's playing me, yo.  I was on him from the beginning on that one.  Jimmy.  You guys know comedian John Joseph?  He works at Stellar Alliance. 
[00:32:30]  Which one?  He was really good friends with Harry Chapin.  He does, like, musical.  He plays guitar.  I saw his face.  And, yeah, he has great Harry Chapin stories.  Like, he knew him.  He used to go to his house.  Like, he remembers when fucking Cats in the Cradle was, you know, being created.  Really?  Yeah.  I know him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, John.  He's been around for years.  I think he's funny, too.  Yeah, he is funny.  He's a really, really nice guy.  Good thing he wasn't accepting lights from him.  Driving with him, yeah.  Exactly.  Hey, can I drive you somewhere?  We'll take the expressway.  What are some of the clips you hit during the Ralphie? 
[00:33:00]  Oh, please tell me.  Dude, I'm going to ask you.  If I know which one it is, if I hear it, I'll remember the moment.  Well, we could play all of them.  I'm going through it.  Was it this?  Was it this?  Was it this?  Was it this?  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  Be more funny.  Oh, no.  It was something I said, right?  It was a clip you hit.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, a clip.  Oh, forget it.  But that's what it was for both of you guys.  That's child's play.  That's easy.  It was a clip you hit and a clip and hit.  It was back-to-back clipsy. 
[00:33:30]  It was fucking hilarious.  And it just made me laugh for the rest of the day.  Was it the dirty stuff about sucking dick and stuff?  I remember the one.  Or is it this is going great?  Was it this one?  So, isn't this great?  I don't know.  This is going great.  Because you are a disgusting fat boy.  That one made me laugh.  But I remember the two that Ann hit back-to-back.  You hit, you are never to blame.  And then suck my sweaty balls. 
[00:34:00]  Suck my sweaty balls.  That one had me for the fucking...  Really made me laugh.  But there was one you did before it.  I don't know.  That was so obnoxious.  Yeah.  I can't remember what it was.  When I hear what it is, I'll remember.  But it was just...  Oh, it's a dumb button I pushed.  No, but it was...  I'm not going to be depressed.  No, don't be.  It was the same.  Both of you guys hit...  No, I'm just sad.  Just made me laugh.  I better go back to the skin doctor.  Oh.  And have her lift my ball back.  Look at my sweaty balls.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Check my sweaty balls.  Dude, there's a fucking art to that. 
[00:34:30]  There is an art to that.  To those fucking...  We got lazy on this machine, too.  Because we got so many clips.  When there's one of those roles where it's natural and it's just fucking...  The clips are just destroying somebody.  Dead on, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's almost like I know...  Because I can see what people in the audience can't, which is the two of you hovering over  your machines and looking.  And I know you're not listening.  I'm listening to poor Ralphie pour his heart out.  He's like, you know...  We're just waiting for that fucking spot. 
[00:35:00]  I was molested.  And I just see you guys pulling your fucking covers off and hovering your fucking...  Yes!  Because there's key words.  When you hear molest, you're like, oh, okay, that's bank number five.  Bank three has the molester clips on it.  But I know that nobody is really hearing the agony of this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Which made me laugh.  It was sad, but it really made me laugh.  You mean we get distracted a little bit?  Go another direction?  Just those fingers hovering over those buttons.  Funny, Jerry.  There's a cop that did the right thing in Times Square yesterday, huh? 
[00:35:30]  I am a cop, you idiot.  And then Kenny told me another cop story that was...  Is he...  Oh, he's getting food.  Fuck.  Always when we need him.  But I guess there was a homeless guy...  Was it Times Square?  I think it was Times Square.  And it was one of those cold days recently.  He has no fucking shoes on.  And the cop went into his Skechers and got him fucking some boots.  Yeah, some cop.  He's a 25-year-old cop.  He lives out on Long Island. 
[00:36:00]  He's walking around Times Square.  Sees this homeless guy.  And the homeless guy gets up and starts walking away.  And he's barefoot.  It's freezing cold.  And he felt bad.  So he goes into a shoe store.  Buys a $100 pair of Skechers boots.  I guess the store owner knew what he was doing.  Right.  So he gave him like a 25% discount on it.  Oh, jeez.  That's nice.  That's nice.  I call that almost nice.  Wait, is this the Skechers?  Yeah.  They gave him 50% off.  Oh, 50?  It was $99 shoes and they gave them to him for 50 bucks. 
[00:36:30]  Well.  All right, that's nice.  And then the cop went out there and, you know...  Threw cold water on the guy's feet and said, look what you can't have.  And knocked his teeth out with his shoe.  It was really, really uncalled for.  And I put the shoes on the guy and then asked him if he wants to get a cup of coffee or something  to eat.  And the homeless guy said, no, I'm good.  Thank you so much.  They went and sold the shoes and got high.  That's what I told Ann.  Exactly.  That's what I told Kenny I mean on the way in.  This is all nice, but we've been in this world for a while.  Why doesn't he have shoes? 
[00:37:00]  He said he didn't like that people were laughing at the guy, which I can understand.  He said people were like making fun of him.  Well, that's just shit.  But I don't know how fucked up you are.  I mean, I don't want to do that.  No fucking shoes in that weather.  It's just horrible.  Of course.  You have to lose his shoes.  And no one is supposed to know about this, by the way.  He just did it.  And it was just some lady took a picture of it going down and put it on her Facebook page.  And I think the picture got hundreds of thousands of likes.  Yeah.  Something like that.  What does the story say?  I think I heard over 100,000 likes on the picture. 
[00:37:30]  No, 400,000.  429,000, I think.  Wow.  Really?  At the time this article came out, it was 350,000 likes and 85,000 shares.  Ooh.  All right.  Let's set up my next video.  So, uh, Sam.  How many sunnies?  Oh, I was going to say that.  I was like, nah.  And you were right.  Let's set up the next video.  This one could go viral.  I'm going to find a homeless guy with no fucking shoes.  Yeah.  And I'm going to make believe it's all a fucking organic, natural thing.  You're going to be there with the camera, though, Sam, to capture the whole thing. 
[00:38:00]  It's the complete opposite of your last strategy with a homeless guy.  What do you mean?  You gave him a cake and then stomped on it.  Oh, see now.  I would argue with the people that hate that, that we made his day better that day.  Yeah.  Who hates that?  It's hilarious.  There's not even any reason to argue it.  Hilarious.  We made his day better.  It's funny.  Because if I didn't smash the cake, you don't see...  Whatever.  I hate giving away our secrets.  He walked away with a lot of fucking money.  Andrew. 
[00:38:30]  And he ended up eating the cake anyway.  But people don't know that.  Yeah.  He loved us for that.  What happened to him?  Where did he go?  I don't know.  He enjoyed it.  Oh, treat yourself.  Because he was so generous.  But it's a stale.  I told you what I'll never forget about that was I think I was standing behind you.  But I remember when you jumped on the cake so completely that you skidded forward.  I almost broke my neck.  Yeah, you almost broke my neck.  I almost slid on that cake, didn't you?  It was a jump and a minuscule slide forward. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Your feet just ripped through the ice.  And I do confess that I did that just to make you and Anthony laugh.  Oh, it worked.  I wasn't even thinking about the audience.  Because these guys, when I do some of this shit, they get so uncomfortable.  And I really was just seeing what your level of comfort was that day.  Oh, it was fucking.  I don't need to see this again.  It's just a horrendous thing to do as a human being.  Oh, it was so uncomfortable.  Really fine.  Let me see some.  Turn it up.  Wow, that looks good.  Wait, go back. 
[00:39:30]  That was 2008, huh?  Oh, Jesus.  Soundry music.  Oh, yes.  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  That's a safe.  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  Oh.  What is it?  Wow, that looks good.  But I am not treating it.  Touch you, Eden.  No, it's some kind of a cinnamon cakey thing.  I had to walk away.  Oh, no.  I'm leaving.  Oh, no.  Oh, look at him.  Oh, no. 
[00:40:00]  He goes, that's not nice.  Oh, he did it on that.  Oh, he did it on that.  That slow motion.  Did you see this skit forward?  Yeah.  I was, I obviously.  Oh, he did not do that.  That's terrible.  Oh.  Oh, no.  He did not just fucking.  Oh, no.  You knew it was coming, right?  When I was, hey, let me see that.  Slow motion. 
[00:40:30]  He's right.  The whole thing slid forward and then you slide back a little bit.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  That was definitely not right.  That's terrible.  He did get a tremendous amount of money after that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Everybody handed him fucking.  He probably walked away with $100.  Yeah, he could have bought fucking 500 more cakes.  Way more than 100.  Maybe more than that.  I could have got a hundred myself if you really need to know.  Yeah.  Easily a couple hundred bucks.  I earned that cake.  Fucking videos.  You have the weirdest voice.  I earned yourself.  That was 2006? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  That's six years ago.  The fuck?  Really?  Yeah.  Goddamn.  He might be dead.  You never know with those homeless.  Yeah, he was supposed to do the homeless shopping spree.  He didn't show up that day.  And I think we saw him one more time after that.  Yeah, we don't go that way anymore is the problem.  I wonder if he's still around.  He disappeared from that area.  What about the homeless guy, the cross-dressing homeless guy?  I see him every once in a while.  He was scary.  Really scary.  He would wear high heels and lipstick and his nails were done. 
[00:41:30]  But then he looked like a typical homeless guy.  And man, as soon as you approached him, he went all fucking ballistic every fucking time.  Remember we wanted to play homeless roulette to see who we went after?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a bit scary.  What's up, man?  I'm just watching.  A lot of people get shit delivered to their houses.  Right.  And they're showing these.  Because a lot of people have security cameras around their houses these days.  And they're just showing people stealing their packages from outside their fucking houses. 
[00:42:00]  Why is the fucking post office just leaving them outside?  Yeah, sometimes you could request to have a signature, you know, mandatory signature when they deliver and shit like that.  But sometimes they do just leave it.  But it's like...  It's terrible.  You just can't fucking...  God, I fucking hate that.  Yeah.  Fucking savages.  That lady's just running away with the package?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  Ugh.  God. 
[00:42:30]  We live in a shitty world.  We need force fields.  Yeah.  I want a force field.  How come it's 2012 and we don't have force fields?  Jesus Christ.  We were robbed of the future.  No way.  Robbed.  Everyone concentrated on computers.  We didn't see that coming, but...  Those are force fields.  I love that picture.  Oh, Arrested Elmo?  Yeah.  How do you know that guy?  Times Square, huh?  You know the police officer.  Who is he?  Let me see.  You don't...  You...  I don't know if Jim and Ant know him.  How do I know him?  That's my friend. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, yeah?  Is it really?  Yeah, I don't know if he wants his name mentioned, but you know what I'm talking about.  What?  He...  I thought he worked...  No, he's a Times Square cop now.  Times Square.  What did that happen?  He went to the academy and then he got...  But I thought he was local for Westchester.  No, no, no.  He went NYPD.  That's him?  That's him.  Yeah, that's his claim to...  He texted me when he heard you guys talking about Elmo the other day.  Oh, shit.  No kidding.  Because he's the one and he's a buddy of mine.  He arrested Times Square Elmo because he was yelling out anti-Semitic stuff a couple 
[00:43:30]  months ago.  Anti-Semitic.  He went viral.  The Jews he was yelling?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The picture went viral?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This whole story.  This is Sam's friend.  He is entertaining as all hell, man.  He really is.  And I've told Sam many times, you got to try to figure out how to get that on the radio.  Fuck the money lenders.  People want to know if Jimmy tried to date the cross-dressing homeless guy.  I most certainly did not.  Yeah, that guy was fucking...  He's scary as shit.  Oh, but Kenny has the other story, but I guess he's not here. 
[00:44:00]  Another cop that did something nice.  Cop.  And it turned out a little differently.  Oh, well, that'll happen.  I'll let Kenny tell the story because it's his story.  I can't stand those stories.  Yeah, it's not as good.  Look at this fucking clusterfuck of copyright infringement going on in Times Square.  You see Elmo, and then there's a SpongeBob walking past them.  They're all just dirty.  Dirt superhero costumes.  Last night, I was walking to a restaurant, and I was behind Elvis. 
[00:44:30]  Fucking Elvis walking down with a fucking North Face backpack on.  It just doesn't seem legal.  How is it legal?  I think it's so impossible to...  What, are you going to serve these guys with a cease and desist and have them actually pay attention to it?  You're going to drag them into court?  They're not going to show up.  They're not going to send people out to arrest warrants for not appearing in court for a copyright thing by an Elmo. 
[00:45:00]  So they just, you know, they don't even bother, I guess.  It really does degrade the character to the children in Times Square when it's some smelly fucking homeless guy that can't speak English in a Mickey costume, you know?  True.  True that.  Maybe then they go to Disney finally, and they don't want to talk to Mickey because he was a piece of shit in Times Square.  It hurts their product.  Minnie Mouse.  Right.  Yeah.  Fucking Goofy.  Goofy's out there.  I've seen the Goofy. 
[00:45:30]  You like Times Square?  I do not enjoy the Times Square at all.  There's nothing there.  You can't walk into a store if you need something in a hurry and buy something.  I told you that story where I needed a six-foot Cat 5 cable for my apartment.  I walked into one of these electronics places in Times Square.  $35 they wanted for a six-foot Cat 5 cable that you get for $0.99.  $35.  I started yelling at the guy.  I go, you're a fucking piece of shit. 
[00:46:00]  And he's like, they rent very high here.  It's like, you don't mark up a $0.99 cable to $35.  Are you exaggerating?  I'm not.  It was $35.  Holy fuck.  I know they're bad.  I picked it up.  I went to the counter.  I fucking put it down there.  He goes, rings it up.  I saw $35.  I thought it was like the code for the fucking, like a part number.  And he's like, $35.  I was like, what?  I threw it.  I was like, get out of here.  Fucking made me mad. 
[00:46:30]  If you come to Times Square, the electronic stores are brutal.  They're terrible.  Obviously, as Anne's saying.  But there's one pretty much on every block, too.  Yes.  On every block.  And everything in their window, like they'll have a camera there and it'll be like, hey,  10 bucks for this camera.  No, there's nothing in there for 10 bucks.  Yeah, that's how they get, they're getting you into the store.  We do not have that model.  We have this one.  And it's fucking $850 for a $20 camera.  Now, that seems like it shouldn't be legal.  Right. 
[00:47:00]  I don't know why they, I'm sure rent is really fucking high there.  But, I mean, $35 for a 99 cent cable.  Shut up.  There you go.  I like walking through Times Square because it's good people watching.  I can't stand the fucking guys with the signs, need money for weed.  Like, oh, the honest approach.  Well, that was, someone came up with that years ago and everyone was like, wow, that's  fucking funny.  But now every single one of those guys is doing that.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  I can't say, it's too much fucking panhandling and begging going on in there.  And then the rubes just make me sad.  They're fucking looking up and they're taking pictures of shit that, like, who are they going  to show?  Taking pictures of a fucking billboard with Diddy on it.  Who are you going to show that to when you get back to Oklahoma?  We do take pictures of dumb shit, right?  Oh, God.  The advent of the smartphone camera has made it even worse.  People just feel compelled to take pictures of everything. 
[00:48:00]  They take a picture every step.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah.  Let me, let me get this one.  Yep.  Yeah.  The only ones that actually have nice cameras are the Asians.  Everyone else is just pulling out their fucking smartphone, which, I mean, good enough  camera.  I think it is.  I think finally.  Yeah.  I think it's on par finally.  Hey, where's E-Rock today?  Where is the E-Rock today?  How do you guys get all these days off?  I need your agent.  Are you kidding?  He's got another day off? 
[00:48:30]  He's got a little vacay.  Is he taking every Friday for the foreseeable future?  He just came back from vacation.  He did.  He's giving himself today and I think Monday too.  He just came back.  He just took the entire Thanksgiving week.  How do we get this deal?  Amazing.  I need to know.  I don't know.  I mean, E-Rock, he's been here for a while, so he's managed to accrue.  I'm not even mad at him.  I just want to know how you get this deal.  He also knows.  I mean, also, when you guys don't come in, we can come in and just hang out.  And just not work. 
[00:49:00]  I mean.  And I don't want to blow up your spot, but I do have to say that is the dumbest thing  ever.  Oh, my God.  It is stupid.  It is.  Unless it's like.  I come from a time where everyone had to take vacation at the same time.  I'm not blowing up anyone's spot and I will insist that that continues.  Right.  But it just shows how stupid they are.  I love pointing out how stupid they are.  Like, okay, we're not here, but you still have to come to the office and do what?  Right.  And how long could that possibly take? 
[00:49:30]  Eight hours.  But maybe an hour to two hours would be important for the show.  And so then they have you guys sit for an extra six.  Yeah.  Maybe no hours would be important.  I'm trying to be nice about it.  What is E-Rock doing that he needs a four-day weekend?  Because whenever, when we talk to him about Thanksgiving, we say, so you took the whole week.  What'd you do?  Watch cartoons.  He consumes.  He just consumes.  He likes his consuming.  He really is a one-man locust. 
[00:50:00]  DVDs and snacks.  That's it.  It's his days.  He gets his days and that's it.  Go for him.  I'm ready to break, but our food ain't here.  Oh, our food is here.  Before we break, can I just say, because I don't want to get on a long rant about it,  how I guarantee you Lindsay Lohan still doesn't go to jail.  They filed a charge in California because she lied to a cop after the accident.  And she punched some woman in the face, apparently.  That's what's being alleged.  Alleged.  At the bar.  Third degree assault.  Yeah, I don't know if it's true or not.  First degree is the bad one, obviously. 
[00:50:30]  But any other, and the papers say any other probably would have spent the night in jail.  Like, she just gets away.  They said she got sentenced to 120 hours or 120 days in jail for stealing that jewelry.  And then, of course, it got put to community service.  Of course, she didn't do it.  Nothing sticks.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  I don't think she should do 30 years, but fucking Christ.  If we, any of us, including the people listening, if we did half the shit she did, we would be doing some time.  Or it would be way worse, I guess, is what I'm saying. 
[00:51:00]  It's embarrassing.  It's funny, though.  New York City is a brutal place.  They fucking hate her.  I mean, the city is fucking hating on her.  Like, get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, I don't think she'd get away from her.  I think the front page of one of the papers is basically saying, go home.  Yeah.  It's going to get ugly for her if she stays here.  She was banned from that club, apparently, at one time.  And then, I guess, they let her back in.  And they're saying, allegedly, that it was over.  She was jealous over this nightclub singer.  Not paying attention to her, but he was talking to some psyllium.  But, yeah, that could be a lie. 
[00:51:30]  Who knows?  She's a complete loser.  I can't fucking stand her.  Because when we met her, when she was in the studio that nightclub...  She was kind of cunty.  She was kind of cunty.  I'd never seen anybody of celebrity status so annoyed with having to fucking, like, take a picture.  I got the best story.  What?  Absolutely.  Don't fuck her.  First, I fucked her.  When the shit comes out.  Right.  She was beautiful, though, when we met her.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  Before she fucked up her face with the Botox and the puffy lips and the, in my opinion, drugging and boozing.  But I do have the best story.  She made that shitty Mark David Chapman movie, and they were filming outside the Dakota.  And my girlfriend at the time, who's now my wife, was taking a walk through Central Park with my little, little niece, who's now, I think she's 12.  So she might have been sixth, I would guess. 
[00:52:30]  Sure.  And they're walking through Central Park, and they come upon Lindsay Lohan on a bench with a bodyguard close, no one else around.  And my now wife, you know, asked, hey, you know, my niece is freaking out.  Can we get a picture?  And she fucking lost her mind, said no.  Bodyguard got involved in everything.  And nobody was around.  I mean, for a six-year-old.  My wife didn't want the picture, trust me.  But, you know, my niece lost her mind, like, oh, my God, these are mean girls.  And she fucking said no. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, she's just a cunt.  And, uh...  I mean, I can understand, like, the famous, if there's a lot of people around, you're going to cause a scene.  But I'm telling you, there was nobody.  She picked this park bench to get away from the filming for a little while, you know, in between shots or whatever.  Did you say, you should get cancer?  You should only get cancer.  And her piece of shit father was on TV again.  Last night?  Or the day it happened that night.  Just, you know, Lindsay's in trouble.  This fucking...  I really...  I hope this guy is fucking hit by a car. 
[00:53:30]  I hope he is fucking run over, crossing the street, and killed.  He really is.  What an attention whore.  And then the mom's not much better.  But I don't see her on the news...  Like, this guy I always see interviewed.  And I've just...  What a fucking bag of shit.  Yeah, the whole family seems like they're big of shit.  You sell your own daughter out like that?  Ugh.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's a fucking...  The broad needs help, obviously.  She's thrown in jail for six months.  I don't give a fuck if she gets the help, to be honest with you.  I don't either.  I don't give a fuck.  She's had a million chances. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  You can't...  You can't feel sorry for someone that has had a million fucking chances.  I feel sorry for you if you, you know, a couple chances and whatever, but not a million.  How come there's not the same hatred of her that there is of Chris Brown?  Like, what he did was really brutal, but it was one incident.  And meanwhile, what she's done is fucking...  She's been a cunt for years, and then this whole driving and smashing into a truck thing  and then lying to the cops.  Like, she's adding up.  She's done...  Yeah, yeah.  ...probably pretty close to what he's done, because she's had altercations. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, it's...  I mean, a guy hitting a woman.  No, I know, but it's just...  That one's just brutal.  The amount of venom for him.  That's barbaric.  But, you know, there's just no...  People kind of think she's...  She was getting killed at her Liz and Dick performance.  Oh, terrible.  We didn't even play the clips on our show.  The acting was amazingly bad.  Was it bad, really?  I almost felt bad for it.  I was kind of hoping it would be great.  It was bad.  I watched it.  I mean, she had...  Everyone mocked it, so I...  You know, we missed a boat on that, but it was bad. 
[00:55:00]  Do we have any other...  Maybe for a commercial break?  Like, while we're at break, I'll watch it.  It's uncomfortably bad.  Oh.  Was he good, or whoever played Burton?  I don't know, because they mostly played, you know, her just acting bad.  He was fine.  I mean, the movie was bad.  Oh.  She was bad in it.  It wasn't an interesting movie.  They made a big deal about it when they were filming it, and I thought it was like a real movie.  I know.  It turns out to be...  Oh, it's a lifetime fucking movie?  One of those movies.  One of those.  Film in a week?  Yeah.  Please.  Yeah.  Fuck that. 
[00:55:30]  Fuck that bitch.  All right.  I'm still going to fuck that bitch.  I'll play these...  We've got to get an ONA Jingle winner today.  Oh, right.  From the single contest.  We've got Steven Singer coming in today.  Oh.  Steven Singer is coming in.  You want to go over some of the jingles next?  Yeah.  All right.  Does he have his assistant with him?  Probably.  Is he going to have that assistant chick with him?  That eye candy?  I'm getting word on something.  What?  Oh, oh.  Somebody did not bring eye candy with him.  Oh, tell him to go home. 
[00:56:00]  What the fuck?  Really?  Why do we want to look at Steven Singer's face and not that wonderful eye candy that he brings  with him?  His lady is not here.  Does he think that his super silver argentium diamond collection is attractive enough that  he doesn't have to bring a wonderfully attractive woman with him?  I mean, it makes people...  It makes the girls like it so much.  You just got to say, I hate Steven Singer.  Oh, boy.  I get it.  I get what he's going for.  Yeah?  Yeah, I get it. 
[00:56:30]  What?  Wants people to hate him.  Yeah.  Well, I hate Steven Singer.  Because when I saw those billboards for the first time, I'm like, wow, man, there's a  lot of hatred for this guy.  I better look him up.  I get it.  Exactly.  I get what he's going for.  You remember his name, don't you?  I sure do.  That's right.  You better...  Did he bring the good stuff?  I hope so.  Go see what he brought us.  Okay.  I'll go find out.  And if it's not good enough, tell him, you know, to beat it.  Okay.  Scram. 
[00:57:00]  Travis just said, I'm hearing nothing.  I'm hearing he didn't bring anything.  Did Steven know where he was coming?  I'm not sure.  Did they throw him in a car with a fucking blindfold on and drive him here?  Steven brings business and good energy to this radio show.  Steven Singer brings advertising dollars.  Nice.  And a smile.  And that's all we need from Steven Singer.  Yeah.  Steven Singer brings joy by his enthusiasm for this radio program and his ability to pay 
[00:57:30]  his advertising bills.  He does love you guys.  Yes, he does.  Yeah, good for him.  IHateStevenSinger.com is where I go for all of my jewelry needs.  Oh, Sam.  That was free.  I didn't get paid for that.  Very good.  Sam, what did you find out?  He said he brought Mr. Beano.  Mr. Beano.  That's his nickname for his penis.  He says, give Mr. Beano a kiss. 
[00:58:00]  He's been arrested in the park for that.  It hangs out and his pants pockets are rabbit ears.  Mr. Beano is a rabbit who leaks a lot out of his one eye.  Mr. Beano.  What's that?  Beano gifts today.  He said that, right?  Oh, yeah, he did.  And then Kenny chuckled.  Of course he did.  Oh, God.  That's a good one.  Beano gifts today.  But his sparkling personality was on display for me, so. 
[00:58:30]  And he brought a couple of fucking Gs for the prize winner.  That's true.  A couple of Gs.  All right, well.  All right, he gets a pass this time.  Okay.  Now we'll make it hurt when he's in here.  Of course we will.  We'll at least do that.  Beano.  Joe Piscopo calling in today, too.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Should I play one of these things?  No, I'll do it in show.  Yeah.  I'll do it in show.  So, Travis, just play something cool.  Yeah, please. 
[00:59:00]  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  But as for me and Grandpa, I believe.  Oh, she's rocking.  She's been drinking too much eggnog.  Oh.  And she left me on the counter.  Drunk mother. 
[00:59:30]  But she forgot her medication.  And she staggered out the door into the snow.  Snow.  When we found her Christmas morning.  Oh.  At the scene of the attack.  Oh.  She had hope prints on her forehead.  Oh.  And my foster father stuck it in my crack.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer. 
[01:00:00]  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.  Oh.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  Through my tiny eyes, I watched my mother leave.  Oh, is that me?  Oh, whatever.  My uncle said he'd kill me if I tell. 
[01:00:30]  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Oh.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Oh.  All the family's dressed in black.  And we just can't help but wonder.  Should we open up our kids or send them back?  Send them back.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Oh.  Oh.  How improvise.  I'm nice.  Yeah.  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve. 
[01:01:00]  Aw.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  Hmm.  But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.  One more time, everyone.  Oh, there's more.  Now the goose is on the table.  Counter.  Oh, shit.  And the pudding made of fig.  Oh, no.  And the blue one silver candles.  Oh, there you go.  That would just match the hair and grab on the wig.  I've warned all my friends and neighbors. 
[01:01:30]  Better watch out for yourselves.  Oh.  They should never give a license to a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves.  Oh, look out.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.  Sing it, Grandpa. 
[01:02:00]  Oh.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  She kicks it up.  See that?  It's great.  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.  She looks like she's going to pass out.  I know.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.  Merry Christmas.  Patty.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  I enjoy Patty's renditions.  Yes.  Patty's renditions are very good.  They're always very interesting.  Very festive, by the way. 
[01:02:30]  She knows how to sing.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  She's right there.  Patty really got into it.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, because it just doesn't do anything.  It just sits there.  Eats and shits.  Steven Singer's going to be in here in a few minutes.  Giving away $2,000.  Oh, that's right.  To the winner of the O&A Jingle Contest. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  We're going to make him wait because he didn't bring any shit today.  He brought Bino.  Yeah, Mr. Bino.  Mr. Bino.  Mr. Bino.  There'll be no gifts.  That's his Pekka.  What the fuck is that about?  I don't know.  He doesn't like us anymore?  Maybe it's the economy.  Yeah, I got a big job for Steven Singer.  And I'm now thinking maybe I don't go down there to the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  I'm starting to think I might have to go somewhere else.  I got a big job.  There are other corners, you know, of 8th and Walnut.  There's three other ones.  Yeah, that's right. 
[01:03:30]  I had to snip rings off my wife's finger.  Were you a looter?  Fingers.  Finger?  Finger.  They were both on the fire.  While you guys arguing?  Yeah.  But she was pregnant.  She decided not to take those rings off until the last minute.  And that turned out to be the wrong thing.  And her finger turned blue and purple.  And I had to snip them off.  So I need someone to fix that shit.  It's a big job.  And I might still need a push present.  Oh, yeah.  So if I was him, I would fucking go out to Times Square and find us some fucking jewelry. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, man.  You didn't get your wife a push present?  Are you supposed to do that, like, when she's pushing?  Yeah, probably.  A push present?  Do you know about this?  The girls made this shit up.  I have no idea.  They had a secret meeting years ago and decided, you know, you have to now buy something if  your wife gives birth.  It's called a push present.  Oh, because she put it?  It has a name and everything.  Oh, I gotcha.  It used to be like, wow, that's really nice.  You know, we now have a child together.  But no, no, you have to fucking give them something now. 
[01:04:30]  But she's pushed already.  You don't have to get her anything.  Oh, cool.  It's over.  Nice.  You gave her spermatozoa.  That's right.  Yes.  You gave her that hot beef injection.  And a roof.  Yeah.  And a roof over her head.  A roof.  And a roof.  Exactly.  So, Steven Singer, man, he's blowing it today.  I got a big job.  Is this his audition?  Oh, man, you know, he hands out the gifts and it is that time of year.  We're expecting a lot of gifts from sponsors and listeners this year. 
[01:05:00]  It's been lackluster the last couple of years.  I like to be in the presence of presents.  That's right.  Yeah, that's good.  That's a good one.  Dr. Steve, that's a guarantee.  He'll give us some shitty mug with his stupid logo on it and a shitty wine.  But at least he's thinking of us.  You know, yesterday we had the meatballs and we had the fucking berries.  It's, of course, a humpback whale.  A humpback whale.  Close to a canoe.  We wonder where E-Rock was today.  Yeah, he's swimming.  All right. 
[01:05:30]  For a dip.  Yeah, he's in the pool.  Poor E-Rock.  Not even.  Did you ever see this thing a fan did for me?  Did you see when I Twittered it?  It was a...  Fan mail from some flounder?  When he spelled my name out in fucking raw chicken.  That was cool.  And the tigers are fucking eating it.  How great is that?  Absolutely.  I saw that.  He should have videotaped it.  I know.  That was a great one.  That would have been a great video to see.  You're going to have a gift on Monday.  From who?  Is it your resignation?  From Steven Singer?  Yeah, try getting it on. 
[01:06:00]  From Steven Singer?  Oh, no.  Monster headphones.  Huh?  Really?  More plugola on Monday.  Nice.  For each other.  Oh, man.  We're getting monster headphones.  Well, it's for the veterans.  They're helping the vets.  Yeah, of course.  And we help the vets.  So that's good.  USA.  That's right.  I love animals.  Nice.  Yes.  Dude, I've been shitting meatballs for 12 straight hours.  Nine hours.  It's veterinary.  Nine hours.  Huh?  Nine hours.  Oh, my God.  Those meatballs are ridiculous.  I know that he's officially not a sponsor, but holy fuck. 
[01:06:30]  Good is good.  What is it?  Meatball obsession?  Yeah.  Holy mackerel.  And the sauce is good.  Are the turkey ones better?  I like the turkey ones better, right, Roland?  I like turkey, yeah.  I like turkey, but is it...  Turkey?  I love turkey.  It says turkey.  But is it the same amount of fat and stuff as the regulars?  What?  Much less.  Is it less?  Yeah, a lot less.  Much less?  Yeah.  Considerably less.  Considerably less.  Yes.  All right, I got a little...  That should be less.  Chicken chopped meat. 
[01:07:00]  Ugh.  Less or more fat than regular chopped meat?  Well, less if there's no skin.  What?  Skin in your chopped chicken meat?  No.  The answer is, in most cases, more.  Really?  More?  And people will, you know, search out the chicken chop meat, whatever it's called there, because  they think it's healthier, because it's chicken.  But the fact is, they put all the skin and everything into that.  Oh, do they?  Yeah.  I mean, chicken is healthy as long as you don't fucking grab that skin. 
[01:07:30]  What's with chicken and their fat skin?  That crispy chicken skin is some of the best shit you could eat.  You talk about beef jerky.  You get a crispy chicken skin, it's amazing.  It's marvelous.  But the problem is, that is really unhealthy for you.  You know what barbecued chicken is like when you fucking, that skin is crispy?  Oh, it's magnificent.  I always, I always just pull that skin away.  Oh, but it's so good.  And sadly throw it in the garbage.  Sometimes they have chicken skin, like, chips for appetizers. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Chicken skin chips?  What's that?  Chicken skin chips?  What else?  Chicken.  One day we're going to do this.  I'm just warming up.  I wish.  I would just go back to my apartment and go to sleep.  I'm just warming up, man.  I think I could go at least ten minutes.  I love being in ship.  It's just my ultimate ego.  We've got to go to The Hobbit.  What time do we have to leave the show today for The Hobbit? 
[01:08:30]  And look, I don't want any shit from the guys down the hall.  We did a lot of extra radio this week.  Yeah, and once you see The Hobbit, they ask for no, it's an embargo.  So you can't really talk about it.  What?  What's an embargo?  You can't tweet.  For how long?  Oh, boy.  Until they get here.  You say it was good?  Yeah.  But don't talk about it.  That's all I would say.  No plot fucking spurlers.  Yeah.  Apparently there's a lot of spoilers.  I'm bringing some hidden cameras into the screening today.  But it's a fucking book.  No, they won't.  I got spy cameras now.  People know what happens, really.  Yeah, but there's some really weird things that happen. 
[01:09:00]  Well, I would assume.  Yeah.  It's in the magical land.  Bilbo dances on a mushroom or something.  There's some kind of conflict with The Hobbit.  Bilbo dances on a mushroom.  He is fricking.  That would stink.  He does a little hobbit dance on a mushroom.  Oh, it's sick.  I am a dancing on the mushroom cap.  Hootly-doo-dee-doo.  Hootly-doo.  All the flowers are there waving at him.  Yes.  Yeah.  That would be awful.  I'm always for earlier is better.  Get your seat.  Relax.  Embargo.  All right. 
[01:09:30]  Embargo.  Are we in a theater or a screening room?  A private screening room.  And do we get the free popcorn?  Is it that place?  No, they don't have popcorn this way.  Oh, shit.  What are you going to do?  Can you bring in your own shit?  I don't know, because the screening rooms are really good.  How do you fucking survive?  You're a popcorn guy, right, at movie theater?  Well, they know I'm an animal.  No, no, but the thing is, I remember when we went to a premiere thing, you came back with  like a shitload of stuff for everybody.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  I just blew past the security people.  Oh, okay.  What, they don't want popcorn in there?  Why?  Because they don't sell popcorn at screening rooms.  Yeah, but you can bring your own in.  This theater is run by Mr. Bino.  Oh.  And Bino Popcorn for you.  Oh, shit.  I didn't even see that coming.  I hate this Mr. Bino.  He stinks.  Yeah.  He certainly does.  He's a Mexican jumping guy.  Oh, boy.  So what, we got to leave around what?  8.30?  That would be great.  That would be great. 
[01:10:30]  Actually, what?  9.45-ish?  Yeah, 9.40, I would say.  Just so you could go to your restroom, walk there with plenty of time.  Or even 9.30.  I mean, I'm all for that.  We've got commercial breaks.  You could probably go to the restroom, drink a commercial, and then do more show.  But it's cold outside.  Yeah.  I don't know if that has anything to do.  We have to see it before we interview them, though.  Yeah.  It's going to be a big movie.  Oh, yeah.  I think it's going to do a few bucks.  That and Les Mis.  Les Mis.  I don't have any desire to see that.  What are you talking about?  Wolverine.  I wouldn't see that. 
[01:11:00]  Why?  It's going to be awesome.  You don't think those songs are good?  I don't know any of them.  I swear to you, I couldn't even know one song.  You'll know them if you heard them.  There is good songs to know.  You'll know them if you heard them.  I went to see it on what they call Broadway.  Yeah.  One song.  Les Mis.  Go.  Les Mis.  I don't think I know this song.  I don't know them unless you played them.  Les Mis.  Les Mis.  Les Mis.  Les Mis.  Les Mis.  Yes, that song.  So you can't even find one.  Oh, yeah.  This is the one.  Yeah.  Is this the over-durcher? 
[01:11:30]  It's on my own.  What?  I don't know this.  Wicklet kicks in.  Yeah.  It's good.  Shut up, this bitch.  I've heard that this, the new movie is all singing.  Yeah, it is all singing.  It is all singing.  Yeah.  That's how the Broadway thing was.  It's all singing.  Is there anything worse than all singing when they tell a story and it's like, I have to  go now.  I get excited.  They just do it on purpose.  Well, I get excited when they have that two minutes of dialogue.  I'm like, ah. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  And then it's just setting up another song.  And then they break in a song.  But this is like all.  Who enjoys that?  Fuck.  We are coming toward our barricade.  What shall we do?  I really don't know this song.  You will.  Well, when am I going to know it?  It's got to kick in.  Everything kicks in.  Sam.  Do you have her name tattooed on your arm, Sam?  Shampile?  No?  No.  I don't know the act.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  I am in Les Miserables. 
[01:12:30]  My boy.  Pretending he's beside me.  I don't know it.  Yeah, yeah, you know this one.  I swear to God I don't know this.  You know this, right?  I've seen the show.  Well, he went to the show.  You know what?  No, no, no.  Let go.  This is it.  Come on.  This is it.  Listen, here it comes.  You'll know this.  I swear to God.  Are you going to totally do?  I feel his arms around me.  Why was she covering up her bosoms?  My way I close my eyes.  Of course it's cold out.  And he has found me.  Here she goes.  In the rain. 
[01:13:00]  Light.  The pavement shines like silver.  When does it kick in?  I don't know it's still.  This is it.  This is it.  I mean, this is the melody.  This is kicked.  Oh.  I really don't know this.  Let's get some.  I've never heard this shit.  Nope.  Dakota Fanning's sister is in that movie or something?  That's right.  Yeah.  Does she sing?  Or do they do the old.  Oh, they all sing.  Yeah, they all sing.  They all sing.  Yeah.  Russell Crowe's singing.  It's all singing.  Russell Crowe sings?  Wolverine's singing.  Well, we know Wolverine's like half a finger. 
[01:13:30]  Wolverine's a song and dance man.  That guy, holy shit.  He's married, but I think that's all horse shit.  Because that motherfucker.  You see him on the fucking Tony Awards and shit.  He's singing and dancing up a storm.  He loves putting on a show.  Yes, he does.  He certainly does.  Most straight guys don't know how to put on a show.  No, not like that.  Why am I saying most?  Russell Crowe is rock, man.  Wow.  The only musical I enjoyed, of course, is Book of Mormon was just brilliant. 
[01:14:00]  I was listening to that last verse.  And that word is used way too much.  Brilliant.  Brilliant.  But Book of Mormon was brilliant.  Yeah.  You like Cats?  Cats.  Did I see Cats?  I don't know.  I'm rich all alone in the moonlight.  Bloody blob.  The musicals I saw were Jekyll and Hyde was okay with Sebastian Bach.  I didn't mind that as much.  The Phantom of the Opera.  Jesus, is that horrendous.  Phantom.  Oh, that's bad.  Okay.  I didn't see that. 
[01:14:30]  I don't even remember it.  Look at Russell Crowe.  He sings?  Oh, he's in that fucking...  30-odd foot's and grunts.  Who is he?  The fucking...  He's that...  The cop guy?  He's the motherfucker.  He's the motherfucker?  Yeah.  In what?  In Les Mis?  I don't know this thing.  What's his name?  You should see it then.  Oh, man.  Jean Valjean.  No, no.  Jean Valjean.  Jean Valjean.  Jean Valjean.  They're all French.  You guys can talk about Broadway during the break.  Hugh Jackman is Jean Valjean.  Jean Valjean. 
[01:15:00]  That's Hugh Jackman.  He's Jean Valjean.  You saw Cats, Sam.  Sam, big fan of the Broadway musical Cats.  Yeah, huge fan.  Did you see the original Broadway production before it left?  No, we didn't.  I didn't think you were old enough for that.  You're not old enough.  You didn't see the original.  I don't know if I saw the original Cats.  You saw it at the Wintergarden Theater, Now and Forever?  Now and Forever, at the Wintergarden Theater.  How come Now and Forever, but fucking that Abba show's over there now?  Fuck Abba.  It's Cats' room.  Cats.  I don't know.  Cats.  Yeah, I saw Cats at the Wintergarden and in London. 
[01:15:30]  Whoa!  Whoa!  Nancy.  Douche.  Listen, can we move on from Broadway?  Yeah.  Oh, people are asking if they...  People think they made a mistake and tuned in OutQ.  Or the Broadway channel.  Ah!  There is a Broadway channel.  We could fucking hang there.  If you want to be fucking bored, go to the Broadway channel.  No, they play good songs, like from White Mids.  I saw Beauty and the Beast.  Who the fuck tunes that in?  Is it good?  No.  They're all the same.  I saw Wicked.  Was that good?  It's the same as Beauty and the Beast. 
[01:16:00]  They're all the same.  You're looking for a good musical, aren't you?  Jersey Boys.  These are all dates.  You've never seen Book of Mormon, right?  No, I didn't.  Oh, my...  What are you waiting for?  It's fucking...  It's a...  Roland, what happened?  It's a masterpiece.  Jimmy's right.  It's a masterpiece.  I was like, I want to go.  It's a...  I need a credit card.  It's a...  I need a credit card.  It's so good, dude.  Yeah, but that's good, too, because there's a long...  There's a long wait for that show.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:16:30]  If he could get you tickets just by you handing over a credit card, you really should do that.  Well, my cousin came up from Maryland and actually got tickets to go, and they were  only here for like a weekend.  They went down to that fucking shack in Times Square.  I see those people sometimes when we go that way home, and there's a line every day outside  the theater hoping.  Yeah.  They're hoping for a miracle.  I saw that play that's all Burt Bacharach songs.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  What the hell is that about?  I can't remember what it's called.  The guy from Will and Grace and Christian Chenoweth were in it. 
[01:17:00]  Eric McCormick.  What did you...  Yeah, the other guy.  Oh, yeah.  Burt Bacharach.  Are we still talking about Broadway?  Promises, promises.  Yeah, I don't know how this happened.  We're still talking about Broadway.  What the fuck happened?  We can move into Burt Bacharach.  How about Burt Front the Reich?  Fucking always brilliant.  Mayor Menino got himself into a situation.  Last time we heard from Mayor Menino, the guy up there in Boston who certainly made sure  we got fired from Boston Radio. 
[01:17:30]  He did help us.  Helped our career.  He was very happy he got us fired, but he had no idea it just made us stronger and bigger.  Yes.  Well, it turns out he ended up in the hospital.  Oh.  With some kind of mysterious illness.  This isn't a gag, is it?  No.  You're not making this up, are you?  Oh, God, no.  And I don't know.  It was a back issue, a breathing issue.  I don't know what the fuck.  A mystery illness for the mayor?  And then he's now going into rehab.  He's been in the hospital for a while.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Since the convention, pretty much.  Wow.  Pretty much.  And he's talking from his hospital bed.  Oh, boy.  Do you want to hear this?  Do I ever?  I'll start by asking how you feel.  Yeah, there's a little press conference because people have been wondering what the fuck's going  on because they didn't give much info.  So they finally did the press conference.  Oh, you got the...  Can we just do the video?  I don't know if it's the same one or not.  All right.  I'll start by asking how you feel.  Everybody wants to know.  How does the mayor feel?  I feel much better. 
[01:18:30]  I keep on reading the papers.  My staff comes in in the daytime.  We go over stuff going on in the city hall.  But, you know, the city is working out fairly well.  And I think everybody's pulling together.  In the hospital, I think 50 days now.  Just...  50 days.  50 days in the hospital?  Yeah.  You don't spend 50 days in the hospital without something really fucking bad.  Of course.  They don't want you in there for a weekend. 
[01:19:00]  What's he been there for?  If you could look it up, I don't know.  I've heard all sorts of shit.  It's very mysterious why he's in there.  They're claiming a back injury, but then there was some fucking breathing problem.  I'm here in the hospital.  I choke on my own tongue.  Days now.  It's like...  What?  Just...  It's wearing more people involved in the decision-making.  And you listen to them.  It's not like the old days. 
[01:19:30]  I'm the mayor.  You'll do this or else.  Well, you listen to them.  And see how it's going to work.  You get their input.  You listen.  He's crazy.  Thanksgiving.  Because Thanksgiving is my favorite, favorite...  What the fuck is he talking about?  He's lost his mind.  Is he medicated?  He might be medicated.  I don't know, but what is the article saying?  So, in October, he was in Italy, and he got very sick.  He went to the hospital.  They diagnosed him with an upper respiratory infection, and then they found a blood clot 
[01:20:00]  that had traveled from his leg to his lungs.  Oh, Jesus.  While he was in the hospital, he fractured his spine, and then they found out he had type 2 diabetes.  Holy shit.  I didn't mean to laugh, but it's a terrible scenario.  How do you fracture your spine while you're in the hospital?  Wow.  If I fell out of bed or something.  Holy shit.  And see how it's going to work.  You get their input.  The most of it.  I suppose you're sure.  Thanksgiving, because Thanksgiving is my favorite, favorite holiday. 
[01:20:30]  The turkey, mashed potatoes.  We're going to have a good time.  The turkey, mashed potatoes.  It's Thanksgiving.  It's my favorite, favorite holiday, because it's time when you help people.  But, Mr. Mayor, to be clear about this.  Yeah, good luck.  You have no plans to retire.  I have no what?  Plans to retire. 
[01:21:00]  I have no plans.  No.  I checked my retirement.  It wasn't good enough.  He's fucked up right here.  What do you want people to know, Mayor?  What do you want the people who are going to be seeing this on television to know?  I just, you know, it's very hard for me to do, but I just want people to know that I'm up and well.  I'm still out there fighting.  I'll be back in a few weeks.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:21:30]  I feel bad for him.  Yeah, it's just depressing.  Now I just feel bad.  What is this?  The feel bad show?  I guess.  That we're running here on this fucking channel?  I guess.  Jeez.  I felt all bad yesterday.  Poor Joe Pisco.  Oh, right.  Who's calling in today?  He's calling in.  Stay tuned, kids.  You're not going to feel bad, because you're going to realize he has no self-awareness.  So, everything is just, you know, perfect in his life.  Do you think he'll go, yeah, that crowd was great. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he will.  Yeah.  And now this.  Still to come, Tony, with an easy recipe that is perfect for entertaining.  Also, the reason why the latest royal visit was extra special for the douche, duke, and Duchess of Cambridge.  The douche.  Prince William, they called him the douche.  The what?  The douche?  Yeah, do you think those people over there in England will ever get over their obsession for the royal family? 
[01:22:30]  No.  Why?  They're useless people.  Yeah.  I don't even know what they do.  Nothing.  They really have become just figureheads.  I mean, they have power.  They all worry about that stupid queen and what she thinks of them.  Fuck the queen.  She ain't no human being.  Ah!  All right.  Let's do it.  Yeah.  She's way older than they ever thought she'd get.  Oh, hells yeah.  She's way older than they ever. 
[01:23:00]  No one saw her living this long.  That's some lifestyle they got over there.  They just fucking treat her like a little veal.  What a weird way to live, too.  You're kind of hoping your mom dies so you can get the big gig.  Get the big gig.  Year after year, you just sit there as your mom, but you really want her to die.  Yeah.  You do.  Yeah.  It's the whole name of the game, right?  If you're born into the royal family, you're not hoping your mom lives a long life.  It's royal.  You're hoping she dies early, man.  Yeah.  Because you're just sitting around waiting. 
[01:23:30]  That's your whole life.  Waiting.  Just last week, there was an article about how impatient Prince Charles was getting.  I don't know.  Well, he should be impatient.  Yeah, yeah.  At this point.  They're not acknowledging the fact that that means he's impatient that his mother refuses to die.  Right.  Yeah.  He's running out of time.  She just continues to breathe.  How old is he?  He's in his 60s.  He might even be 70 at this point.  He's 64.  He wants to be king shit?  Is that it?  What is it?  He's like Simba from The Lion King. 
[01:24:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Safe to say he's been waiting 40 some odd years for everyone to die.  Yeah.  So he gets the big gig.  What's his gig?  It's king, right?  Nothing.  You play a little polo.  No, but I mean, is it...  Would he be king?  Shoot at ducks, I think.  Well, now there's rumors that they might pass him...  Yeah.  Pass by him and go with the young guy.  I was passed over.  Go with the young guy.  I'm smart.  Prince Harry is just like fingers to the Lord saying, I don't give a fuck.  I'm never going to be king. 
[01:24:30]  I can do whatever I want.  Well, he's not even like...  Why?  Because...  Because Prince William, I mean...  Prince William.  Right.  Prince William's going to be the king.  Prince Harry...  Prince Harry doesn't give a fuck.  And then Prince William's kids...  Oh, yeah.  Get it.  Oh, Harry doesn't have a shot.  Harry doesn't have a chance in hell.  But he don't give a fuck.  He don't care.  He's nude in fucking Vegas suites playing pool.  He's not even blood related to those guys.  He's done.  In my humble opinion.  I don't think he doesn't look like... 
[01:25:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  He doesn't look like Charles at all.  He's got a big head of hair.  His mother was a fucking whore.  He's got a Khloe Kardashian thing going on.  Yeah.  Could you do this again?  I love it.  Lady Di was a fucking...  The guy that Lady Di was supposedly, or has it been proven, had an affair with...  I would go on record as saying, I bet she fucked that guy.  Look at this.  Oh, James Hewitt his name is or something?  James Hewitt?  Look at this.  You're trying to tell me that this isn't Prince Harry's father.  There's something going on there.  There's a better one you passed by, though, Sam. 
[01:25:30]  Go back to the...  And he's got that full head of hair, unlike his brother who's fucking already bald.  No, no.  One more over.  Yeah.  This one.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at that.  Tell me they have the exact same weird nose.  Look at the smile and the...  Oh, man.  The hair, everything.  That's his son.  Your son.  And they will not acknowledge that whatsoever.  Oh, and here's the other one where, okay, you got Prince Charles on the right, you got  Prince Harry in the middle, and then you got James Hewitt on the left. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, man.  So you could decide whose father is his biologically.  Same nose, same smile.  Right.  Same eyes.  Dude, that's him.  Of course it is.  And then look at Charles.  Not a fucking hint that he looks like Charles.  No.  You put Charles and William together?  Because, of course, the shitty royal family won't acknowledge that.  Oh, Charles and William look fucking...  No, they...  Yeah, they both have the...  Exactly.  They got the same dumb bald head now.  They both have horrendous hair. 
[01:26:30]  Poor fucking William's got to do the comb over already.  He lost half his hair during the wedding ceremony.  Look at this.  Of course.  I mean, that's obvious that these two are fucking...  Of course.  Same goofy-looking DNA.  Yeah.  Make it bigger sound like that.  That's why they're just full of shit.  They won't acknowledge that they have different fathers?  It's pretty obvious, I think.  She was fucking...  He has a lot of Lady Di look in him, too, but...  But you can see it in the smile and in the cheekbones. 
[01:27:00]  Sure, you can totally see it.  And the height.  Could you go back to Harry?  Mm-mm.  Now go back to Harry.  Nice hat, Harry.  Give me another Prince Harry picture with the alleged biological father.  The alleged.  I wonder if this will ever come out.  Which one do you want to look at?  We did that one.  We'll never do DNA testing on that.  No fucking way.  It's the same fucking guy.  The nose is a little different.  No, not really.  It's, you know... 
[01:27:30]  Dude, it's...  Yeah, look.  It's...  Oof.  Yeah.  Oof is right.  She accepted his cock.  Willingly.  Lady Di was known to fucking, you know...  Get out.  She got out.  She was with that fucking A-Rab guy.  She sure was.  It's exactly the same as the Kardashian picture we look at.  Like, look at the family photo of the three guys.  Right.  One is obviously different.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[01:28:00]  Whoops.  And then Charles has to accept him as his kid.  And he knows.  He knows.  He fucking knows.  Because he has to accept it for the big picture.  They probably weren't even fucking at the time.  They just cover up all scandals over there.  Yeah.  Look at those pictures, man.  That looks like him.  Yeah.  It's...  That's amazing.  It's pretty cool.  Go down a little.  Go down.  You saw that one?  Stop.  Stop.  Top row.  Right.  Go over one more.  Over one more.  Who's that? 
[01:28:30]  That?  That's Harry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's a pretty recent picture of Harry.  Yes.  But it really looks like the guy, too.  Yes.  Because it's like similar age now right there.  And then look at the other picture of his brother right next to it.  Yeah.  With his dumb fucking Prince Charles baldy head.  And his dumb face.  Who do you think was a better fuck?  The military guy, Hewitt, or Prince Charles?  Charles strictly, like, hoity-toity fuck.  Yeah.  And, you know, James Hewitt probably gave it to her dirty on her stomach. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, yeah.  Wouldn't you love to know that shit?  You think Hewitt and Prince Harry talk and acknowledge, look, I am your father.  I am your father.  None of us could say anything ever.  You think that shit goes down?  I don't know.  Is that Hewitt now?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Jeez Louise.  It's pretty fucking close.  Yeah, there's something there.  It's all over the internet.  I mean, obviously, we're not...  Breaking any new ground?  No, of course we're not.  As they say.  Of course we're not.  So.  Hey, got a couple things here. 
[01:29:30]  I brought it to the show's attention, this amazing Randy.  You want to listen to this real fast?  Sure.  They found the part of the Pendulet podcast.  Where he was talking to the amazing Randy, who is just the king of the skeptics.  Yeah.  He's the number one guy.  And they started talking about faith healing.  And I thought this was fascinating.  Absolutely fascinating.  Because the amazing Randy got into one of these faith healing things.  Yeah.  Went undercover and discovered a lot of shit. 
[01:30:00]  And I thought this was a good listen.  I have experienced people who I think were absolute true believers and also using tricks.  Yeah.  Because they thought, yes, there is ESP, but I've got to bump it up a little bit to convince people.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And when you did the book, The Faith Healers, the wheelchair thing you talked about is an amazing example of that.  Yeah.  You want to explain that?  Yeah.  Well.  It blew my mind.  I first saw it with W.V. Grant. 
[01:30:30]  Now, I don't know if Grant's still in business, as a matter of fact.  He had some problems.  Ho, ho, ho.  And I think that I might have been responsible for them.  Ho, ho, ho.  But we found out that when he came to Fort Lauderdale for one day, that was really in the bag at that point.  I had been suspecting it up until then.  But when he got to Fort Lauderdale, we saw a raft of wheelchairs that were unloaded from a huge van that he had. 
[01:31:00]  Now, I say a raft of, I don't know how many will fit on a raft.  I've never tried, and I don't see any point in doing that.  But it had to be at least 30, perhaps 40, wheelchairs of various kinds.  They were unloaded.  And various kinds is important.  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Not matching.  Oh, yeah.  Because some of them were very ratty looking, as a matter of fact.  And they creaked, and they had flat spots on their tires and whatnot, you know. 
[01:31:30]  And which we would do if we were trying to fake a thing like that.  Yeah, certainly would.  Even if we didn't have to do it, if we could buy brand new ones, we wouldn't do that, would we?  No, we would not.  There you go.  So they were being taken in backstage.  I just made a note of that.  And I was in sufficient disguise, I can assure you, when we saw them unpacking the vans.  And then when some of the subjects there, who we had seen in line, some of them were distinctive, and they were walking, some of them with a walking stick or a cane of some kind, but others not walking with any aid at all. 
[01:32:00]  Then when we saw them brought on stage in wheelchairs, riding in wheelchairs, as if they couldn't walk, and then being so-called healed by Reverend Grant, a stand up from the name of Jesus kind of thing.  And they would stand up and they would walk forward a little unsteadily because they just got out of a wheelchair. 
[01:32:30]  And I saw that, I'm thinking to myself, wait a minute, they know that they didn't need that wheelchair.  Grant certainly knows that they didn't need that wheelchair.  But then when I got to talk to them afterwards, they told me, oh, he said that, yes, you should get into the wheelchair so that we know that you require healing.  Yeah.  That's a sure sign, you see, when we wheel you out on stage, then I know that you need healing.  Isn't that an amazing thing?  So, yeah, they're getting healed for some fucking, you know, headache. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  Meanwhile, they stand up just because they're standing up.  Right.  And to say, like, oh, thank you.  And the trick is that you go, oh, look, you know, we're going to put you guys in wheelchairs so we can wheel you up on stage easier.  And so we know who to pick from the stage.  But everybody watching is like, well, he's in a wheelchair, it must be his legs.  Yeah, but no one else knows that that was said ahead of time.  Right.  Isn't that an amazing thing?  Yeah.  Wow, I thought they really healed him and let him walk on. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, well, and also, you know, to just be more comfortable.  And this, you see in magic all the time in a combination of instant stooging is that you do one trick for the actual person who's on stage.  Yeah.  And another trick for the whole audience.  Exactly.  And that's, it's a brilliant, very sophisticated technique in magic.  Oh, yes.  Having someone pick a card beforehand.  Yeah, yeah.  Out of a deck where you can do a card for us.  Yeah, yeah.  And you can know what card they're going to pick. 
[01:34:00]  And then tell them to look at that card and say, remember that card, think about that card, have that card in your head.  And then when the actual show comes out, you do this all before the show when it's just the two of you.  And then when the whole show comes out and you have hundreds of people watching, you then say, do you have a card in your head?  Is that card just in your head?  Do you have it anywhere else?  You're just thinking of that card.  You've told no one.  Is that correct?  You're thinking of the card.  It's in your head.  It's nowhere else. 
[01:34:30]  And the card is.  And you name it.  And you've done an okay trick for the person.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, if they don't know the card was forced, that's an okay trick.  But for the audience, it's a miracle.  Absolutely.  Because you haven't brought up the deck of cards.  And the thinking that moves that to the wheelchair, that the person, stand up.  Yeah.  How do you feel?  And the adrenaline rush is there.  And they feel terrific.  And they feel healed, you know.  So, and the mention is never, you don't need the wheelchair. 
[01:35:00]  Well, there was a woman.  Very, very brilliant idea.  Oh, well, brilliant.  And evil.  It's not wild.  So, to the audience, they're like, holy shit, this guy was in a wheelchair.  Now he's walking.  But to the person on stage, like, no, he healed my joint pain in my elbows.  Hail.  There's one more part, if this is going okay.  What?  Yes, no?  I like Penn.  Now, I was with a CBS crew in New York. 
[01:35:30]  I've forgotten exactly where I was.  It was CBS Studio, in a way.  New York.  They asked me to go along and see a WV Grant performance.  And I stood well at the back.  And I did a lot of this thing with the hand of not showing the face completely.  I just didn't want to be recognized, of course.  And they were taking notes.  And they were cutting away to me every now and then as I made comments.  And we saw a woman go up on stage, not go up on stage, be taken, I'm sorry, be taken in a wheelchair from the wings out onto the stage. 
[01:36:00]  And Grant took her cane, which was laying across the arms of the wheelchair.  So, this is sort of a half and a half.  You see, it's a very clever gimme, psychologically.  And he took her cane and threw it to the other side of the stage.  And he said, make the devil mad.  And he threw the cane away.  And then he looked at her and he said, stand up and walk across the floor.  Make the devil mad now. 
[01:36:30]  Come on.  And she stood up and she walked a little unsteadily across the floor.  And she broke out into a big smile.  Now, she could do that and she knew that she could do that.  And so, afterwards, I said, watch for this lady.  She was very distinctive in appearance and in costume.  And I said to the crew, keep your eyes open.  Oh, there she is.  So, I called her over and we're out in the lobby.  And we had an easy space where we could operate.  And the video crew was there. 
[01:37:00]  And I said to her, I saw you standing up out of the wheelchair.  And she said, oh, yes, hallelujah.  Hallelujah, I'm healed.  And I said, but you've got your cane back.  And she said, oh, yes, because I'm still unsteady.  I said, but you didn't come in in that wheelchair, did you?  Because I knew very well this had been supplied.  And she said, well, no, I didn't.  But he asked me to sit in it.  And I said, okay, but don't you think that was a little dishonest? 
[01:37:30]  And she actually paused for a minute, hmm, kind of thing.  And she sort of looked up and then she looked at me and said, well, maybe a little bit.  Maybe a little bit.  And she smiled and nodded and turned and started to walk away.  And we kept the camera on her.  And then she spun around and she pointed the cane at me.  And she said, but I still believe.  Isn't that the most discouraging thing?  She's been in on a scam and she knows it was a scam, if she thinks about it at all. 
[01:38:00]  And then she said, but I still believe.  You're not going to take that away from her.  Isn't that amazing?  That's why a lot of those guys continued after they were exposed as frauds.  Yeah, it's their gig.  Well, because people just still believe.  Desperate to believe.  Aw.  The amazing Randy.  I don't know.  If that was of interest to you, you should look up some clips online because he's done a lot of stuff over the years.  How old is that motherfucker?  83, 84. 
[01:38:30]  How old is that queen?  Yeah.  That old queen.  How old is she?  Yeah, Penn Jillette said during the podcast that, well, asked the amazing Randy and he came out when he was in his 80s as being gay.  Gay is for the fucking young.  In his 80s.  But he did say his family and friends always knew.  Yeah.  And, you know, he finally made it public when he was in his 80s.  Great.  Why would you do that?  Wouldn't you want as much fucking, like, cock in your younger years?  I would imagine.  You put it out there and get the cock. 
[01:39:00]  It wasn't acceptable back, you know.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's more acceptable.  For someone in the arts.  Nah.  In the entertainment field.  It was barely acceptable 10 years ago.  Yeah.  It's only been the last 10 that it's been pretty much okay, right?  Yeah.  And still not okay in a lot of parts of this country, right, guys?  Yeah.  They're out there.  Fuck them.  Gay is definitely for the young, though.  So.  For the young.  Those faith healers, though, man, they continued even when they were exposed. 
[01:39:30]  You were watching those?  The mediums are, they continue even after they're exposed.  You were watching those videos.  I was watching videos last night of girls dancing to the Gangnam Style video.  Oh, is that a new thing?  Yeah, there's a few videos out there of chicks just like groups of girls.  Nice.  Like little dance troupey girls just dancing to that fucking shit.  It's hot, man.  Are we going to be-  Fucking girls dancing.  It's very sexy.  Fucking, God.  They can do things with their hips and stuff. 
[01:40:00]  I know this is where this is going to go, though.  What?  I'm going to point out a video, and then we're all going to be uncomfortable because the  girls are going to be slightly too young.  No, no, no.  It had nothing to do with that.  There's a bunch of Asian girls, I guess, right here.  Which one?  This is the one?  This is one.  This is one.  Oh, good God.  Like, it's just fucking-  Look at them.  They're all leggy little Asian girls.  Right?  Yeah, that's pretty hot.  Five Asian girls.  Look at that. 
[01:40:30]  They look like fucking anime.  Is there anything we can add to the Japanese diet to get their private parts a little more-  You want to-  The private parts are always underdeveloped.  Yeah.  Yeah, the ass is a little too, like, flat.  The boobs are a little too small.  It just-  That looks good, though. 
[01:41:00]  They're lacking a little shape, though.  Crazy.  Yeah, they are pretty fucking-  That's pretty hot, though.  What am I saying?  That is pretty fucking hot.  Yeah.  Sexy lady!  What is that dumb move?  That dumb fucking move.  You're holding on to a horse, man.  I'm riding a horse.  It's so stupid.  You used to ride horses.  That's how you probably looked.  I never did this.  No?  Well, how do you ride a horse?  Like this?  No, I just fucking hold the reins.  What do you do with your right hand?  Smack that ass. 
[01:41:30]  How does Anthony ride a horse?  He's the back end of it.  He's an ass.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, pa-pa-pa.  Yeah.  Oh, they're doing a little righty thing.  Look at those legs.  God, I'm a horn dog.  Yeah.  Crazy.  What are you going to do?  Well, who is it when they see this?  No.  That's good shit right there.  Yeah.  We should break and get Stephen Singer in here, because we've got to get the ONA jingle contest 
[01:42:00]  winner.  Gets the sexy right out of the fucking room.  I disagree.  Oh, yeah?  I think Stephen brings a certain amount of sexuality to the show with his seductive hand  gestures and his little glance, his devil-may-care glances.  Maybe he'll allow us to get those super silver argentium love necklaces and pull them out  of his ass like anal beads.  How hot would that be?  I'm fine with that.  Sexy?  No? 
[01:42:30]  Which one should we play in a break?  We've got two new production pieces that are really good.  What are the choices?  One is a trailer for Cobra redone.  Oh.  And one is a clip from a new TV show called America's Got Genitals.  Much like America's Got Talent, but the judges are rating genitals.  It's to you, Ann.  It's to you.  And I'll say this.  It's to you.  America's Got Genitals, the judges are, of course, Howie Mandel, Sharon Osbourne, Howard 
[01:43:00]  Stern, and Rich Voss.  I say let's go with that right now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's go with that.  Let's listen to this.  Welcome back to the finals of America's Got Genitals.  We've got four contestants left, and you at home will decide which genitals are America's  genitals.  Our judges are here.  Rich Voss, what should the people at home be looking for in a penis?  You take a nice one about this big, white, cut. 
[01:43:30]  It's got to be cut.  You don't want it to look like a fucking horrible brown turtleneck, okay?  All right, let's take a look at Travis.  Judges, what are your final thoughts on the genitals?  I'm not sure what that was.  My vote is no.  Look at that.  That looks like a missile.  Nobody likes a ball like that.  It's like a grown man's penis with a young boy's balls.  All right.  Eric is our second finalist.  Eric, why don't you come out here and present your genitals? 
[01:44:00]  You are truly amazing.  I have to admit, you are making me a fan.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  No, you don't think that's a nice penis.  Look at the head.  Look at the head and everything.  The balls, the contrast.  It's a good presentation.  All right, let's keep it moving.  Danny is our third finalist.  Danny, show us what you got.  I'm very confused by you. 
[01:44:30]  Look, I had a lot of hope for you, and all I saw is a guy with his pants off and a rather  small package, quite frankly.  See, that one isn't great because the balls are too tight.  Just an opinion.  And let's bring out our last finalist.  Let's give it up for Kenny.  My boyfriend, absolute perfection.  I am giving you a big yes.  Now, that's a perfect penis.  You know what it is?  Look at the big balls behind it, you know, and the head, like there's a little ridge, so 
[01:45:00]  it's, you know, you'll, when you come down it, you'll hit your, you know, like you'll  know you hit the head.  You know what I mean?  It's fucking, that's a good one.  Okay, the judges have spoken.  We'll find out what America thought after this, when America's Got Genitals continues.  I'm not, I'm not gay. 
[01:45:30]  The Opium Anthony Show.  Hey, what kind of donuts we got?  Oh, wow.  Oh, shit, yo.  Look at these donuts.  Is that a jelly donut?  A jelly donut!  A jelly donut!  I'm holding it like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  Oh, wow.  These are like special donuts.  What are they, the Christmas donuts?  Oh, thank you. 
[01:46:00]  Are these the Christmas donuts?  Are they a big sponsor?  No.  More Plugola?  I love Plugola!  It's the best type of gifts.  I love this.  Red velvet.  I'm gonna, I gotta eat like breakfast and then I'm gonna have a little dessert today.  I might want that one.  Look who's in the studio, by the way, is, you might remember him from Three's Company  as Jack Tripper's neighbor and friend.  We've used that one already, but.  Funny every time, though.  It's just, it really is.  Hi, Steven Singer. 
[01:46:30]  Wait, I just want to say something about Dunkin' Donuts.  They're like all decorated like Christmas balls.  They're very festive, these donuts.  Oh, are those, you did that for the Christmas?  Yeah.  I'll take a couple of those.  Bookie Nights.  You want one, Steven Singer?  No, thank you.  That guy's brains go all over the place.  Don't eat sugar.  What?  You don't eat sugar at all?  No.  He can't be hated if he's sweet.  You really are hateable.  Yes.  Yes.  Why don't you eat sugar?  Yeah, what's up with the no sugar?  Type 2 diabetes.  Oh, shit.  Haven't had any sugar in five years.  Go for type 3.  Come on. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, oh, baby.  It's terrible.  Look, we all have someone in our family that has the diabetes, so I can't make fun of that.  Happens.  You had it your whole life?  No.  You no insulin pumping motherfucker.  That's it.  Well, you got it later in life?  Can't you guys get another sponsor for this show?  I'm the only one that has to get ridiculed.  Exactly.  Can you believe this shit?  You're the only sponsor, man.  It's unbelievable.  We're just wondering when you're going to leave.  No, I'm here.  I signed.  Listen, you guys signed two years. 
[01:47:30]  I signed two years.  Yeah, he signed with us.  Whatever your contract was, that was what I signed.  That's hilarious.  I love that.  You guys are the greatest.  Listen.  Wait, diabetes.  Thank God everybody here is serious blows, though, because it's, you know what I mean?  I'm the only sponsor, so I get like top billing.  Every time an O&A customer comes in, you know, a fan, is, are you sponsoring?  I said, I guess I'm the only sponsor.  Who else is going to sponsor?  I know.  Whatever's going on, I'm doing it.  I really love it.  I'm in.  I don't think we have another sponsor.  It's the greatest.  We have all their advertisers.  Oh, yeah, tons of advertisers, but, you know, but not that they believe in the O&A product. 
[01:48:00]  Wait, diabetes, which one you got, the two?  Type 2, yes.  Isn't that the one you control with diet?  Yes.  That's why I don't have any sugar.  I don't have, I eat very little carbs and no sugar.  I don't, I mean, I would flip over and have it if I ate crap, you know, but I don't.  So you could eventually eat sugar again if you want, if you get your diet under control.  I mean, I could, but I choose not to.  In commemoration, he's selling gold-covered pancreas.  Yes.  It's amazing.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:48:30]  Ay, yi, yi.  What is the plural of pancreas?  Pancreas.  Pancrei.  Pancreas.  I don't know.  Why no gifts today?  Well, it's like this.  I'm giving you two grand for the winner, right?  Exactly.  We gave two $500 gift cards to the EROC winners, right?  Yeah.  Which if this fucking technology worked, I could have called up because I wanted to vote, but  I'm listening to it online.  I'm like 20 minutes behind by the time the lag time calls in. 
[01:49:00]  You're lucky you got it at all if it was online or the app or something.  It shuts off right in the middle of wherever I'm at.  He's right.  There's a lag time.  Oh, it sucks.  One time we left and I got home so fast that I listened to the end of the show.  Right.  Yeah.  I think it's about, it's over five minutes now.  Oh, yeah.  It's like eight minutes or something.  It's like eight minutes or something.  It's unbelievable.  I heard myself close the show from my apartment.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah, that is kind of dumb, Steven Singer.  You should be running this place.  Listen, I don't carry stuff around with me, but anything you guys want, I will absolutely 
[01:49:30]  hook you up.  We know that, Steven.  And besides that.  Did you hear?  I heard you ruined all my rings.  Well.  Oh, man.  And I, why wouldn't you call me?  There's a couple things I was going to say.  First of all, I would have hooked, I would have told you how to get them off.  You didn't call me, Tony.  I want to thank you for taking care of my brother-in-law.  My pleasure.  You couldn't be bothered.  You weren't in the store that day, but your people took care of me, which was really nice.  You said, listen.  Which was really nice.  I was somewhere, actually, I think I was in New York, and he called and said, listen,  we're coming down now. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, man.  And, you know, but we're walking up.  I deal with, what's his name over there?  He's awesome.  Tom?  Joe?  Joe.  Joe, I think it was.  Turbo Joe.  Turbo Joe rules.  Turbo Joe.  Don't lose him.  He's a good guy.  He's a good man.  That's almost as good as Tebow.  Right.  Turbo Joe.  I know I was taken care of when he went in there, my brother-in-law, for the engagement ring,  and I appreciate that.  And then my wife decided to, she loves her ring so much, she kept them on her fingers.  She's really in love.  She took her way too fucking long when she was pregnant.  Well, you've got to give them to me.  I've got to fix them up.  They're bad. 
[01:50:30]  I know.  I heard you ruin them.  I had to snip both rings twice.  Because the one didn't work, because then I couldn't pull it apart.  So I had to snip it again.  That's a disaster.  How would you have gotten them off?  Well, we have a thing called a guillotine.  And it looks kind of like a can opener.  It slides under.  It has a little hook.  It slides underneath so it doesn't grab the skin.  And you turn it, and it slices the ring real nice, and then you open it up, and it's...  Holy shit!  It's a very cool thing.  It's not like a bolt cutter?  Yeah, people from the hospital send us people every week.  We send people over that her rings are screwed up. 
[01:51:00]  She waited way too long, Jimmy.  There was no way I was getting this ring off her finger.  Then we'll put it back together.  But it sounds like he butchered them so much, I'm going to have to remake, cut the whole shank  off the bottom part of it.  Well, then I did stretch them, too.  They look ugly.  I should have brought them in for it.  I was cringing when I was listening to the description of doing it.  You know what I mean?  That's like, let's just say, the Jocktober.  That's how he reacts to that fucking...  Yeah.  It was bad.  What'd you use?  Like, nippers?  I might have a picture of what I think it would look like.  What'd you use?  The fucking pliers, side cutters, dykes? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, exactly.  All that stuff.  The snips.  Can you make it look like they weren't cut?  Yes.  It'll be completely invisible.  Yeah.  It'll be...  You'll never know anything happened.  Let me see if I can...  Yes, we will fix it up for you.  I've got to find the picture really fast.  Could you make me a gold dog collar?  You know when you were listening to Joe Piscopo and you guys were cringing?  No, I don't know what you're talking about.  Well, there's a chance I won't be the worst guest of the day, but...  Well, a slight chance.  But when you were listening, when you were describing how the silence over the room and how they're 
[01:52:00]  forcing...  That's how I felt when he was talking about the rings.  Messing around.  Oh, did you fuck that up?  There's all...  Wow, look at her finger.  Yeah, she waited too long.  And then as soon as she tried, then everything rolled up bad.  She's in love with the Opie.  Dude, you had a twisted piece of the ring, like...  What is...  And then I wasn't sure I had the skin when I had to go for the snip.  Oh, yeah.  But time is running out.  Her finger was purple and blue.  Yeah, that's terrible.  I was saying, what the...  I was going to go to the... 
[01:52:30]  If you would have called me, I would have told you exactly what to do.  I don't think...  Oh, my God.  I would have hooked you up.  No, look how bad that is.  I've been doing this for 32 years.  But how would you have gotten that?  That's pretty bad.  I would have told him, listen, there's tricks to the trade.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  Is it...  What do you put, butter?  We looked up stuff on the old internet.  You know, her father is...  Because what happens is as soon as you start to panic and you start to do it...  That's what happened.  ...then it starts to swell up.  Right.  It wasn't as bad before you start to panic.  No, it wasn't.  Right.  And then you start to cut and you start to do it and then she's nervous. 
[01:53:00]  You're worried you're going to cut her finger and it gets worse and worse and worse.  I had a...  I made her promise me that she wouldn't get mad because I had the snips and I'm like, look,  I don't know if I have a piece of your skin.  Right.  Are you cool with this?  Because your fingers are...  Your finger is blue.  Right.  I keep saying fingers because it was two rings on one finger.  Right.  I go, your finger's blue.  I got to do this, but I might snip you and I don't want you getting fucking pissed off  because I really don't know.  Right.  And then with all my force, and then the piece went pew across the room. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Now, if we do it, it's a real easy fix.  What you did is like you stressed the metals like taking off the top of a beer can.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're going to stress it back and forth.  The metal is ruined, so I have to cut it all off and put new stuff.  You put some stress fractures in there.  We'll fix you.  And I don't have to get a push present, right?  You absolutely do.  It's eight weeks in.  It doesn't matter.  Fuck!  Listen, every...  Of course the jeweler's going to say hi.  No, listen.  Yeah, I know.  Because you have asked the worst person.  Of course.  You asked Sam when he came in for his engagement ring.  What did I tell you? 
[01:54:00]  What did I say to you?  I said, don't get engaged.  She's making a mistake.  Don't get married.  I said, first of all, she's way too cute for you.  But besides that, don't do it.  I said, you've got to be an idiot.  Right?  It's the dumbest...  Listen to Anthony.  Anthony knows, right?  I know every flick.  You make your business selling engagement rings, and you're telling the guys  as they come in, don't do it.  How are you open?  Because you've got to be a fucking idiot to get married.  And by the way, there are other things you can get girls besides engagement rings.  Stop!  And that way, you don't have to get fucked over by getting married. 
[01:54:30]  Because...  I'm looking around the room.  I'm seeing, you know, this is new love over here and new marriage and stuff like that.  There's got to be someone else in the room that's completely disgusted with marriage  at this point.  Yes.  We know that, yes.  As you point to the unknown.  Oh, boy.  Oh, brother.  But, yeah, no, you definitely have to get a gift.  You're right over there.  You definitely got to get a gift.  And they make up some shit.  You know when they go in the ladies' room and they all go together?  That's where they teach these classes of what you got to do.  A gift for this.  You know, this happens.  That's where the conspiracies happen.  Mother.  And you got to...  You get... 
[01:55:00]  They say you have up to a year.  Right.  To get the...  And you have to get a...  Stephen, let me tell you a little story.  Yes.  About my engagement ring.  It was beautiful.  It was at the other corner of the track 22.  You've heard the story by now, right?  Yeah.  Penn Station.  Yes.  There was a jewelry store in Penn Station.  I walked in.  I went, yep, she's worth that.  You think they're reputable in Penn Station?  Oh, I'm sure there's no shit to switch there.  I wish I could have baited and switched my fucking life. 
[01:55:30]  You know the book you guys had the guy in a couple weeks ago with the hotel book with  the heads and beds?  You think that guy died?  That guy died?  You're kidding me.  Yes.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  Oh, first Mr. B, no one, now this.  Oh, this is going to be a great day.  Anyway, yeah, so I am working on a book, and I have a whole chapter of bullshit stuff  that jewelers do, like loser jewelers.  I, you know, 95%, 98% are honest, legitimate, and do a great job. 
[01:56:00]  98%?  Yeah, very high percentage.  There's no way that it's that high.  No, I'm telling you, but the 2% or 3% that are bad are really bad.  What's something shady that they do?  You know the places that buy old gold, and they do that type of shit?  So they'll bring, there's three or four things they do that are just unbelievably ruthless,  and that's one of the reasons why I never did it.  One of the things they'll do is they'll take something in, they'll test it, and they'll  say, oh, no, this is no good.  You know, it's fake or whatever.  You want me to throw it away for it, and people say, oh, yeah, it's worthless, and they throw  it in the trash.  People leave, take it out, thing's worth, you know, whatever, five grand, something like 
[01:56:30]  that.  Wow.  I mean, that type of thing.  That's a shitty thing.  Another thing they used to do is they would take, you know, the acid that they test gold  with, they'll scratch it, and they'll put acid on it to test it.  And they do this in pawn shops.  They do it all over.  Yeah, I've seen it on pawn stores.  With salt or whatever, whatever other chemical they put in to cut it.  So they'll say, oh, this stuff, it tests up, it's not real.  You know, when they'll do the thing, they'll test it up.  So if it's fake, it turns up green.  It looks like it's gold-plated or that type of thing or gold-filled.  And if it's real, it stays clear. 
[01:57:00]  So they'll say, no, see, oh, this is all fake.  This is that type of stuff, and it's all real.  I'd say, like, well, I brought my own acid with me.  Let me fucking try it in front of you.  Wait, but how do they make it to turn green if it's real?  Because they cut the acid.  They cut it with either salt or some other chemical in there.  So it gets off like a false negative, you know what I mean, that type of stuff.  No, I want to go into that business.  That's why I'm asking.  That sounds like a great business.  There's a lot of shady stuff.  Shysters.  I'm in the business of idiots, much like radio. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Well, welcome, yes.  I need a piece of jewelry.  I don't wear jewelry.  I don't wear a watch anymore because of, you know, just the phones.  You don't use a watch anymore.  But I want to get a piece of jewelry, just something that...  Do you have a pinky ring?  No, nothing quite like that.  What's the matter with you?  Cock ring.  No, I want to get some...  Steven Singer's cock ring collection of super silver argentium around your ball bag.  Steven, I'm going to do you a favor today.  I'm going to size you up for that.  We've got a guy named Tony who went from Brooklyn all the way down to CU. 
[01:58:00]  Right.  And he was extremely happy.  Tony?  That's nice.  Why was Steven in New York?  I drove from Huntington all the way down to Philly.  Yeah.  Took the train down.  And Steven, you actually gave me a Flyers hockey puck.  I did.  Three-year-old.  Yes.  That sounds like something I would do.  Yeah.  I have my three-year-old son.  I buy those gold-sized roses for Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, and I like the...  Those are great weapons, too, by the way.  They really are.  You can still be wise.  Just plunge those right into her chest. 
[01:58:30]  Can you ever imagine how many roses have ended up in a lady's chest?  Oh, through an eyeball.  Right.  That's a good zombie killer.  Like, somebody ought to use that in The Walking Dead, where they take one of Steven Singer's  gold-dipped roses and plunge it into a zombie's head.  Or in between the ribs, too, man.  It'll get in between the ribs.  Oh, yeah.  You could kill someone.  So, you had a good experience down there, right?  It was unbelievable.  It was hot cookies for my three-year-old son.  And you know what, guys?  Just go out there, take the trip, because everything online, there's more in the store. 
[01:59:00]  So, I'm going to get everything, every different color, and get a nice bouquet for all of them  by the time it's all done and set.  All right.  Well, that's very nice.  Thank you for the kind words.  Ain't you special?  Yeah.  And you got that Starbucks right across the street.  Yes, we do.  I like that.  Yes, we do.  I like that a lot.  The other corner.  But the O&A customers that come in are very, very loyal.  We have...  We know that.  You always can tell an O&A customer.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Why?  Because they're looking for a ring for $30, and they have a mullet? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, you're familiar with them.  Yes, yes.  And you got the fresh cookies, and you make sure the girls show off some cleavage.  Yeah.  We have a lot of good-looking girls.  We like to make it fun.  That's true.  The question's pouring in.  Does Stephen ship to Canada?  What's that?  We can ship to Canada, yes.  Oh, okay.  He can ship to Canada.  A little vague.  Well, there's some tax...  There's certain price things and certain tax issues.  Are there tariff issues?  Yes.  Tariff.  The first year we started shipping to Canada, we didn't realize what was going on with the 
[02:00:00]  tax issue.  So we were sending something, let's say it's $200, and we paid $300 in shipping for it.  It was free shipping.  Holy shit.  It wasn't real smart.  It was one of my brighter moments.  Isn't the whole world economy thing fucked up like that?  You can't just...  It's like, no, that's going over there.  That's $300, please.  Right.  Yes.  It's like, go blow me for going over and imagining you're lying.  One of my greatest joys is when you guys fuck something up or you get upset about something.  You must have a lot of joys.  Well, when you start ranting and raving about something like that, and then I start yelling 
[02:00:30]  at the radio, and I'm just...  I'm like...  What's his name?  You're with us.  The guy that just resigned, the congressman who was in a mental institution.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jesse Jackson Jr.  Jesse Jackson Jr.  Right, right.  When you said, he's in a fucking mental institution, and they re-elected him.  They re-elected this guy.  I'm yelling at the radio.  I was hysterical.  That's why we don't want everyone to vote.  And they just wanted to keep him in office until after the election so he could resign, 
[02:01:00]  and then they have to do whatever they do to fill the office without it being a legitimate  election.  Right.  It's fucking ridiculous.  Yeah.  That's a mental patient.  And that's why it should be hard to vote.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Hey, you want to pick a winner for this contest?  I would love to.  Get you the hell out of here?  I think it would be great.  Then we could get back to our show.  How many are we going to listen to?  Uh, 17.  17?  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  That's a lot.  That is a lot.  You've got to decide.  I want you to decide.  I get the final pick?  I think so.  Well, I would have picked a different E-Rock winner. 
[02:01:30]  Really?  Wow.  Which one?  I like the Rolling Stones guy.  Okay.  The one that was doing the Rolling Stones.  Because I thought it was evergreen.  You could listen to it all year round.  And the Christmas one, I liked it, but I thought I'd only listen to it.  We would only rip E-Rock at Christmas time.  Steven Steven's like a super fan.  It's kind of creepy.  I like it.  No, I'm not.  Sympathy for E-Rock?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was Sean.  Listen, there was a lot of them that I liked, but I liked that one the best.  Yeah, I kind of liked that one.  It just kind of was a good one.  When he sells, I'm an asshole! 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, yeah, that was good.  That was the whole song.  That was the line right there.  It built up to, I'm an asshole!  I would like to just isolate that and have it on my phone ring like that.  Just say, I'm an asshole!  Hey, which one was your favorite?  Oh, no.  You know, I called to ask her a question.  She says, you know, I can't listen.  Yeah, I bet.  I bet.  I said, all right.  It's too real to you, huh?  Yeah.  Look how sad she gets.  It's all in fun.  It's just got to be like, oh.  She didn't want to come with me today. 
[02:02:30]  She goes, no, I can't be.  And you know what, Steven Singer, if there's any of these you don't want to listen to anymore,  just say stop.  All right.  Because we've got to get through all these.  I like when you say my name, you say my first and last name every time you say it.  Steven Singer.  You don't say Steve or Steven.  I'm smart.  You say Steven Singer.  Because that's promoting you.  That's branding?  Branding, man.  It's all about branding.  Who are you on Twitter?  Yes.  What's your Twitter name?  I-H-S-S for I hate Steven Singer.  I-H-S-S.  I-H-S-S.  Really do.  I-H-S-S.  Push that whole I hate Steven Singer. 
[02:03:00]  We're very focused.  It's very Nazi-ish, too.  The S-S-I-H-S-S.  Exactly.  I-H-S-S.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Look out.  Next day on the S-S-S.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  J-W.  You still got the ghosts?  Yeah.  The ghost of Steven Singer?  Yeah.  I hope he took the tour.  He was down.  The tour's pretty cool.  There's a fucking ghost in there.  You feel like you're in a fucking movie, man.  Really?  Yeah.  Can I just complain?  He explains shit.  Oh, shit.  It's awesome.  I just want to complain about something. 
[02:03:30]  Let her rip.  Every time I come in here, I think about your old studio.  This studio blows.  You're right.  Thank you.  And I got to tell you something.  You got no fucking green room.  I was in another show on this same floor.  Oh, boy.  And I went in one green room.  Then I went into another inside green room.  Then I had a whole...  What the...  You used to have a setup.  Now you got, like, friggin' draw with condiments in it and trash all over it and warm water.  Man, look at how he's saying.  There's a refrigerator that doesn't work because they can't plug two things in and say, give  me this water.  It tastes like camel piss. 
[02:04:00]  And it's...  I don't know what the hell's going on here.  This, by the way, the worst fucking bottled water ever.  It is.  And it's warm.  Crystal geyser.  Yeah.  I mean, it's probably fine.  It's just warm.  No, it's terrible.  This is our sponsor noticing this.  The main sponsor.  But you know what?  And they think we bitched too much.  If you...  This was supposed to be temporary.  But can I say something?  And then you share it.  You know, you share it with the boys afterwards, right?  Right.  And I don't know...  We don't have a problem with that.  No, that's fine.  But, you know, if you have nice...  I mean, you've had some A-list guests recently. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, Leota was sitting in that shitty office.  Right.  I mean, which begs the question, what the fuck am I doing here?  But at any rate...  Oh, man.  I mean, you've had some really good interviews and some really...  I mean, Louis C.K. and Penn and the guy from Back to the Future.  What's his name?  Christopher Lloyd.  Christopher Lloyd was great.  And I love that intro now in the top of the show.  That's great.  That is a good one.  Nah, listen.  Just listening for his reads.  But the...  I like when you say, oh, music.  No music.  We got the music.  We don't have music.  It's half an hour music.  Was that your choice, Stephen?  Yeah, I don't like the fucking music. 
[02:05:00]  But what...  You don't like the bed in there?  Yeah, yeah.  We're obviously your favorite show.  I like...  It's obvious, man.  Listen, I like the more...  Whatever's going on, you incorporate it in the spots.  That's great.  I love it.  That is fun.  I love it.  Could you...  But I...  Hold on.  I'm going to...  Why don't you guys have a better setup?  Hold on.  Because you would attract better guests and it would be a whole...  The whole thing would be better.  We get it and trust me, the listeners get it because they hear us bitch all the time.  Can you do us a favor and talk to Scott Greenstein about this?  Well, I'm going to talk to the new owners.  I'm going to wait until February when the new guys come in and Mel leaves.  Liberty Media?  Yeah, because maybe these guys will have a fresh start. 
[02:05:30]  I'm hoping...  I'm hoping it'll be better.  I'm hoping it won't be the same or worse.  I'm more than willing to take the chance because it can't be any worse.  Because...  I'm hoping these guys pump a whole new energy into this joint.  I mean, there's a half a dozen guys in the country ever that have a radio show like this.  Wouldn't you treat this like a gem?  Wouldn't you...  Wouldn't you...  Wouldn't...  Should their whole job just be to make you guys happy?  Yeah.  Like, I was talking to Roland.  He was telling me some of the crap that he's going on.  What the hell?  I mean...  Can you really talk to Scott Greenstein before you leave today?  Listen, I'd be happy to talk to you.  He won't listen to me, but I'll be happy to talk to you.  Yeah, but it'll be another person and it'll be coming from a different angle, too. 
[02:06:00]  You're absolutely right.  You can't have A-listers in our shitty office.  I always cringe because I listen and I figure, this guy's sitting in that same crappy chair  that looks like a massage chair from the airport or something in there.  Terrible.  It's so unprofessional.  It is.  And embarrassing.  You're real.  And Opie's right.  It was supposed to be temporary.  And that's why I bitch about Gary and Rob because they're supposed to be aware enough  to realize how bad that actually is for a radio show. 
[02:06:30]  But they're fucking clueless.  And that's why I mean everything I say about those guys.  And you have such unbelievable potential.  And they're doing a lot of great things.  And they're doing a lot of nice stuff.  Well, they put the on-demand.  If it works, they have that on-demand thing, which is nice to feature.  I thought you meant Gary and Rob.  I can listen now on my smartphone if it works.  It's good.  You know what I mean?  It's like Back to the Future where I can listen to a transistor radio now.  We should have management sell jewelry and you should be our management. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, I would, first of all.  Why is all the logic coming from the jewelry guy instead of the radio guy?  If I was the producer of this show or if I was my-  I would-  And Steven.  I would-  There's so much stuff I would do different.  And we tell them, look, we'll work with you.  Just knock this wall down so the place feels a little bigger.  They won't even knock that wall down.  They just won't fucking do it.  That's all wasted space that, you know, E-Rock sits in there.  He doesn't need a bulletproof glass between it.  Well, maybe he does.  Oh, geez.  But he doesn't need the big window in the wall. 
[02:07:30]  And we could screen the phone calls from out there.  It's wasted space.  It's like, at the very least, just knock that wall down so it feels bigger.  I don't know.  I just don't.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  I don't either, to be honest with you.  And then all the great stuff, the funny, like the homeless shopping, all the great stuff that you guys used to do.  And then when you were talking about the old days, I was saying, like, what the hell?  Like, that was what made it different.  It's depressing me.  I know.  Get the hell out of here.  No.  You're right.  And I hope that this should be embarrassing for people down the hall to hear. 
[02:08:00]  No, it won't be.  But it should be embarrassing to hear one of the biggest sponsors on the platform, if not the biggest sponsor on the platform, coming in and saying that and meaning it.  Not being a dick, just honestly meaning that.  I just think you've got talent.  Like, you should cherish it.  You know what I mean?  You go through so many losers.  I mean, I'm on a lot of shows and a lot of stuff.  There's a lot of stuff that's not that good.  That I'm on.  And they can even be number one in their market.  And they're still just because there's nobody else. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  I'm sure Gary listened to you.  But he's just a figurehead.  He means nothing.  He's that middle management bullshit.  They can't really do anything.  To me, it would take so little to make you happy.  Yeah.  Thank you.  A green room.  A little bigger studio.  Thank you.  Wow.  A little bit nicer environment.  You know what I mean?  And we're going backwards.  Yeah.  It would be funny if the next thing you really wanted was two better hosts.  A nicer vibe in the room.  Yes. 
[02:09:00]  That we have to say.  All right.  All right.  Slow down a little bit now.  Jimmy and I are doing an air shift.  But, you know, it's a different time.  All right.  Well.  All right.  Let's get to this contest.  Let's give away some shit.  Oh, yeah.  Do me a favor and walk down and talk to Greenstein.  Listen.  Demand it.  Say I'm a big sponsor and I got a few things I want to say.  What are you going to do?  Kick me off?  What the hell do I get?  Hey, you in the corner.  Oh.  Can you make sure that happens?  I'll talk to anybody.  Is he here yet?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know.  No one knows when he's here.  That's good.  But, anyway.  Here's the jingle contest.  Look how successful you guys are even with us.  Going to enjoy your long weekend? 
[02:09:30]  Right?  No?  Long weekend?  Yeah.  You don't?  She wears the pants in the family.  Holy shit.  Somebody's got to make the money.  She works way more days than he does.  Somebody's got to bring home a lot of bacon.  Oh, man.  That's fucking funny.  I didn't mean it.  Oh, Sam.  That's brutal.  I didn't mean it.  You can say things, but you don't say them to the person who made the worst decision of 
[02:10:00]  her life.  I love her.  All right.  We got $2,000 courtesy of IHateStevenSinger.com.  Yes.  Right.  You have to choose the winner there, Steven.  Just me alone?  We're not all going to vote?  I will help you.  Come on, Walt.  We've heard these things so many times that it's kind of getting lost.  I've only heard the EROC ones.  I haven't heard all the other ones.  No, we played a lot of these to start the contest.  So you got a pen and paper to keep track a little bit?  And if you hate one, just fucking tell me to stop it and we'll stop so we can get through  these, okay?  Here's the first one from Andy Schroeder, the O&A Jingle Contest. 
[02:10:30]  All right.  The finalists.  Wake up, you radio wizard, you radio wizard, the show's begun.  Get up, you radio wizard, even though we know you'll get nothing done.  Come on, you radio wizard, the show needs you here to kill a bit.  Let's go, you radio wizard, you magically churn everything to shit. 
[02:11:00]  Here comes the radio wizard, the radio wizard is on his way.  Here comes the radio wizard to take all your hopes and dreams away.  Radio wizard.  That's perfect.  That's what we were talking about.  There you go.  Right on time.  That's stupid middle management.  Useless. 
[02:11:30]  You don't think they're helpful?  Oh, God, no.  He's not even aware enough to see what a sponsor sees when he comes around every once in a while.  How many times a year do you come by?  Twice?  Maybe three times?  I'm a bit serious, maybe half a dozen times a year.  I come to see you once or twice a year.  And you notice all this stuff, and the guy that kind of is, I say babysitter, and I mean that,  babysits the channel, doesn't see any of the stuff you see.  I don't know.  It's indifference.  Their whole job should be to make you guys happy, and then you make everybody else happy, 
[02:12:00]  the listeners.  There you go.  All right, here's the next finalist, Lucas Hunton.  Ever since he was a young boy, he's been fucking bored.  His venice instincts, he just clutters up the hall.  Asking him a question's like talking to a wall.  That egghead dummy doesn't like the show at all. 
[02:12:30]  That egghead dummy.  He's the radio wizard, but doesn't know shit.  The radio wizard is such a stupid twit.  Why do you think he doesn't like the show?  I wish that he would.  Oh, man.  Good.  What floor?  What, 36th floor, 38th? 
[02:13:00]  What floor are we on?  36th.  I'm not going here in the window, because they're going to throw me the fuck out the  window.  After these jingles and what I said, I'm going to be done.  How much is here?  Huh?  Is that the full amount?  I didn't count it.  I believe you.  Huh?  Whatever you want it to be.  What, like, two Gs or whatever?  That's fucking nice.  Those are some...  I'm such an asshole.  I actually...  Jimmy.  You fell for the...  Oh, it's the I hate Steven.  I hate Steven Singer.  I was going to Twitter a photo with all the money. 
[02:13:30]  I'm such a dummy.  With the fake $100 bill that you see folded on the street, and you pick it up, and it's  an advert.  Oh, Steve.  His eyes lit up.  You got all the tricks.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to say...  Good one.  Although Lucas was good, it wasn't as good as the first one, right?  Because we've got to make some tough decisions now.  I had one point ahead for the first one.  All right.  So I'm crossing out Lucas.  All right.  So we've still got the first one.  All right.  Now the next one is from Evan Lambert.  Come on down and meet Dr. Gay. 
[02:14:00]  Exec producer on ONA.  Mom and a Jew and ran away.  From Dr. Gay.  And the rest of his family.  Still plays on D-Clip every day.  The staff's all here.  He takes vacay.  From Dr. Gay.  Check out our full line of swastika-shaped butt plugs.  Come on down and meet Dr. Gay.  Exec producer slash closet pay.  Grew a beard to try to sway.  His dad's to sway.  She married a Jewish guy. 
[02:14:30]  That's pretty good.  That is a good one.  Where you at, Steven Singer?  I still got that one point ahead for the first one.  All right.  So we have to cross out Evan.  It was good, though.  Could someone tell Joe Piscopo he's going to have to wait?  Uh-oh.  He's going to have to wait.  Oh, no.  Steven Singer way more important than Joe Piscopo.  That's right.  I'm saying it.  I'm saying it.  So we should let Joe Piscopo know that Steven Singer's in right now.  Yes.  He'll have to wait.  Yes.  Okay.  He's going to have to wait.  A Z list.  What am I?  What's the worst thing you could be known? 
[02:15:00]  Z?  Not even on a list.  Yeah, not even on the list.  You're not even a member of our staff?  Right.  All right.  We're going to go with George Huckus.  All right.  This one was very popular.  All right.  I'm on the floor like I run the show.  Hogi in my mouth.  Hogi in my mouth.  E-Rock army nigga.  E-Rock.  E-Rock army nigga.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Fat boy in the seat.  Bikini girls on the screen.  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup. 
[02:15:30]  I like that one.  I like that.  I like that one in the E-Rock contest, too.  Yeah.  I think I'm tied with the first.  You guys are going to have to help me with that.  All right.  So we'll keep that in the contest for now?  Yeah.  I like that.  I picture that guy pulling up with spinners.  Do you say that word, Stephen?  What?  You know that word.  What word?  The word.  What word?  Iraq.  That was in there?  Yeah, Iraq.  Army.  Army.  Nego.  No.  No, he doesn't say that.  In my personal life, no.  No, of course not.  Not even the Safeway with the GGA?  No, I love all people.  So do we. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  No.  Well, most of we.  Wow.  Was that Fezzy singing that other song, though?  Oh, yeah.  Do you mind the bikini pictures?  No, I fucking love them.  No, not you.  Do you mind that certain people patrol through bikini pics?  A little creepy, but.  A little creepy.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a little creepy.  I got to stick up for him.  I don't think that's creepy. 
[02:16:30]  There's other things he does way creepier.  Yeah.  It's a creep.  All right, let's move on.  Do you ever lay in bed, like, just looking up at the ceiling, and say, what happened?  Every day of my life.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  All right, you ready for the next one, Stephen?  Let's go.  Yes.  This is Ron Roof.  He made the finals for the $2,000 that Stephen Singer's going to give away in a little bit here. 
[02:17:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Jam.  Jam.  Big jam tits.  Jelly.  Big jelly tits.  Tits.  Tits.  Big jam tits.  Big jam tits. 
[02:17:30]  Big jelly tits.  Tits, tits, tits, tits.  Big jam tits.  Big jelly tits.  Big tits, tits, tits.  What now?  What now?  That one should have got way more attention.  I'll tell you what happened.  Why is it so much funnier right now?  I know why.  I'll tell you one of the reasons.  I know why it's funnier today.  Well, it's funnier because Eric don't get two votes.  But it's funnier because you can, like, now...  Even though it's that Eric got two votes.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  Well, aren't I supposed to listen?  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  For sure.  Thank you.  Here in the studio, you can hear...  Like, I didn't hear all that stuff in the background.  When I was listening on the radio, I couldn't hear it as well.  Okay.  And it's funnier here than when I heard it over the air.  It was way funnier today.  Yeah.  It's been funny the whole time.  I mean, even funnier today.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know why.  All the stuff that's in the background that they're singing underneath the bed, that's  pretty good.  What are you going to do with that one?  I'm going to get a three-way tie here.  Wow.  You guys are going to have to have a tiebreaker or a runner-up or something. 
[02:18:30]  We'll see.  Unless there's somebody that breaks through.  We got Kate Allen.  T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.  What else did they say underneath?  We don't know why we know his name, but everybody knows his name in the middle of the day.  Anywhere, it's Jerry Shepardini.  It's Jerry Shepardini.  It's Jerry Shepardini. 
[02:19:00]  She's not so kind.  I wouldn't put her in the finals.  No, no finals for that.  That's not a final.  No, I mean, I like where...  Entertaining.  I like where the business head is.  But, Steve, when you're bored, just say, done.  All right.  We've got to be cruel today.  Well, some I like to listen to something that they're redeeming at the end.  Yeah, maybe.  You never know where it's going, right?  This guy is one of my faves.  Go ahead.  Sleeves.  All right.  Oh, God.  What?  You like the Sleeves song, Fa La La La?  I'm feeling pretty good.  La la la.  Let's hear it again.  Make my way to the la la la la. 
[02:19:30]  Well, that's his Christmas song.  This is his entry in the contest.  All right?  It's called Kick the Can.  All right.  Well, that's all you say, like a bag of change.  My dozen dogs there, like Michael Penn.  What?  I turn the radio up to all say.  I'm going to listen to the fine band.  Take it back to our day. 
[02:20:00]  All right, all right, all right.  You come free.  I'll kick the can with all me and Adam's and me.  All right, enough.  Done.  What?  What's wrong?  It stinks.  He's terrible.  He hates sleeves.  How about the blues?  It's very creative, man.  I'll kick the can with all me and Adam's and me. 
[02:20:30]  Got a little Leonard Cohen in there?  I kind of like that.  I kind of like it.  I hate Leonard Cohen.  I think I'll kick the can with all me and Adam's and me.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  What does he mean, kick the can with Opie and Anthony? 
[02:21:00]  Olly, olly, olly.  What?  It makes no sense.  Wait, is that the only reference to our show?  I had no idea what else he was talking about.  That's good, man.  So it's one of his original songs, and then he just throws Opie and Anthony onto the...  Steven Singer, I'm going to take this one.  He's out.  Really?  Oh, yeah, I like that one.  Yeah, but he took an original song, and then he fucking just put our names on the...  Oh, wait, what do you mean?  Oh, that was one of his other songs? 
[02:21:30]  I think.  There was no O-N-A in there.  I don't know what the hell he's talking about.  There's other...  There's some references.  There was?  Yeah, there's the channel name.  Well, you've got to work that hard to figure out.  I like the song itself, though.  Yeah.  The song is cool.  You don't like that?  No.  It's horrible.  Anthony's so unreasonable.  Oh, I really am.  You get so annoyed quickly.  It's one of my favorite things, is your unreasonable dislike of things.  It never matches up, right?  It's so absolute. 
[02:22:00]  The level's always off the charts.  No, but it's like, I kind of like...  I don't love blues at all, but I can listen to some of it.  And Anthony...  No!  He just loses his mind.  It's out of your mind!  It's just, he's a fucking 80-year-old man.  It makes me laugh.  Thank you, sir.  I really am a curmudgeon.  It's funny, man.  Singer, you want half my sandwich?  No.  You hungry?  No.  It's a nice egg.  Thank you.  Egg white wrap.  Little Swiss cheese.  Oh, I like egg whites.  Do you eat them, too?  Oh.  The kind folks at Sirius are going to treat me to a nice lunch, I'm sure, after this. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, yeah, I'm sure.  Of course not.  Don't hold your breath on that one.  Here's Melanie.  All right.  I love Mrs. Roberts and Hunt.  Strat-Man, this is going to be an embarrassment.  I love the Renee because the show is just full of love.  I don't know, dickhead, because I don't know what was going on that day, fuckface.  They always heckle the hard-hitting fuck.  How do you get a used tampon back in?  Do you see rabbits?  The opster.  The Aryan.  The happy yiggy. 
[02:23:00]  This show's on five days a week.  It's a great show, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Take us out, you no-talent piece of fat garbage.  Oh, thumbs down from Steven Singer.  I did enjoy that one, too, though, but not as good as the winners.  All right.  Sean McCrowski.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  This is the O.P. and Anthony show with uncensored silliness. 
[02:23:30]  What do you think of that?  This is the O.P. and Anthony show with Luke.  I got to stop it, because compare it to the other version.  Yeah.  Dinosaurs.  Dinosaur.  Rugs of dinosaur.  You want to hear that?  What do you think of that?  More than I want to breathe, I want to hear that.  What do you think of that?  It's hard to take that one seriously when we had this one in our heads for a while. 
[02:24:00]  Can I make this a ringtone?  Sure.  This one is the one I would listen to in a mental institution.  I love this one.  I love this one.  Marching, marching.  Wake up, little piggy boy, and fucking take us out.  That's not a finalist, by the way. 
[02:24:30]  I can picture him singing that.  I picture him being a fat guy, like dark-skinned, like a Mexican guy with a lot of tattoos, and  those fucking prison sunglasses, just crooning that into a mic, gently strumming a guitar.  We could have had a live gig with these guys performing the E-Rock songs.  It would have been amazing.  God, why didn't we do that?  That would have been fun.  But they're from all over the country, so actually Sirius would have to fucking spend  money flying them in.  Well, we could have had that as part of, it would have been a bigger contest, but you  have that as part of the contest. 
[02:25:00]  That would be great.  Or would we just give them a hotel?  Yeah.  Or a kiss?  Yeah.  Well, sure.  All right, sign me up.  I want to do that.  That would be great.  We can have it due.  We can do it in the fishbowl out there.  No.  That would be fun.  Maybe we want to do like Hard Rock Cafe.  Oh, that'd even be better.  We mean outside.  That'd be cool.  With the people.  Let's do it.  I would love to see that guy singing that live.  I would love.  Man.  You think Mortimer Leaf is doing okay, Ant?  Mortimer Leaf.  Mortimer.  I said to Mortimer, just take care of that. 
[02:25:30]  No.  Go on along your way.  I want to know how that video ends.  I've never gotten to the end of that.  Hopefully with a gunshot.  You like the way Bud Dwyer's does.  Sleeves, sleeves.  He pulls out a bag.  Mortimer, stand back.  I don't want to get blood on you as a leaf.  Stand back, little Bill the Leaf.  Here goes my brain matter.  There's blood leaking out of my nose.  I'm slumping to the floor.  Goodbye. 
[02:26:00]  Medulla oblongata go down the river.  Pulling out of this envelope.  He gives us a lot of material, that sleeves.  Yes, he does.  I like sleeves.  Here we go.  The next finalist in the O&A, I guess it's like a sound contest, really.  Yes.  Steven Singer's here.  $2,000 for the winner.  This is Brian Huff.  One is a pedophile, the other one's a dick.  Third one sits at home, pulling on his prick.  But when they get together, it's lots of fun.  It's Opie and Anthony for everyone. 
[02:26:30]  That's cute, but I don't say it's fun.  It's horrible.  Wow, you're tough.  Steven Singer doesn't play games.  No, I wouldn't say that, too.  He wants a green room for us, and he wants quality songs.  Exactly.  The next one is the weird one.  Now you got me pissed off.  That would have been so great.  What?  If we would have done that and flown everybody in, we would have had a whole day.  That would take a guy with a brain that's running the channel.  That would have been, and it's not that expensive.  The middle management guy's going to come up with something like that?  Are you crazy?  That would have been a great live show. 
[02:27:00]  We could have videoed it.  Oh, come on, Steven.  That's too smart.  What the?  Now you're talking like a crazy person.  They have three guys.  What kind of budget we got around here?  You ready for this, Steven?  They have three guys that oversee the channel, and not one of them could come up with an  idea.  What kind of budget?  What's going on here?  We already have a name for it.  What?  Bagel stock.  Bagel stock.  That would have been great.  Here's Yoshi in Tampa.  I remember this one.  This one's a bit strange.  Join us weekday mornings from six-ish to ten-ish with Greg Hughes. 
[02:27:30]  Because I was trying to figure out water on vacation.  Water's pretty fucked up if you don't even start looking at it.  Like, it doesn't make sense.  If you really, like, all right, you think about water for maybe a minute.  But no, now think about it for two minutes.  Five minutes.  Try to think about water for ten minutes.  It'll fucking freak you out.  Yeah.  What is it?  It doesn't make sense with the rest of the shit that we live with.  And it's 75% of the planet.  Anthony Cumia. 
[02:28:00]  The molecules slow down.  In water, they're like, whoa, they're all fast.  In gas, they're like, wah!  And then in water and liquid, they're kind of like, whoa.  And then in solid, they're like, brr.  And James Norton.  Man, I'm fucking high as the last thing I'm telling you.  Water's, if you look at that water bottle, it's invisible.  Well, yeah.  And don't forget to tune in on Saturdays for the Joe Rogan Experience on the Obi and Anthony channel. 
[02:28:30]  It's either blue cheese with wings or go fuck your mother.  Why would he just start to help Rogan out?  Rogan doesn't need the help.  All right, no to that.  That's a loser.  It's strange, though, right?  Entertaining, but a loser.  That ain't nothing.  Matty P, another finalist.  I love O. Ian Anthony.  I love O. Ian Anthony.  I love O. Ian Anthony.  Yes, let me show you how much. 
[02:29:00]  All right, another loser.  No.  Okay.  This is Joe Liga, it looks like.  Furby gets the lube.  Jimmy props the ball.  It's a cockerel party.  I mean, I personally don't think it's in contention for the win, but it's fucking fun. 
[02:29:30]  Because the voice, the way it says, at the end, the way it says, cockerel party.  It's fucking funny, man.  He sings like Patty sings.  Oh, yeah, they're going on cockerel party.  It's a cockerel party.  The next one is Josh Howell.  You know Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, no.  Travis, Al and Danny.  Roland, Troy and Sammy.  But do you recall the most morbidly obese one of all?  He rocked the shit, dip, fat fuck.  He's a lazy piece of shit. 
[02:30:30]  And if you ever saw him, you'd know him by his huge bitch tits.  Oh, Jesus.  All of the other assholes.  Don't look over there.  I'm trying not to.  Last one called the piggy boys.  He's pissed.  They never let poor E-Rock have his hoagies and his shitty toys. 
[02:31:00]  What's going to be more uncomfortable, Joe Piscopo or this?  Oh, boy.  Someone in the studio is making believe.  Oh, Lord.  They have email to read.  Oh.  Is this entertaining to you in any way?  Yes.  Not you.  Oh.  Yeah?  You all right with this?  I do.  What do you think?  Boy.  Listen, I love it, but I tell you the same thing I said before.  I don't like it because it's Christmas and I want to hear it all year round.  It's not going to be evergreen.  Oh, very good.  We can play the other ones all year round.  Very good. 
[02:31:30]  The next one is from Ron Abulafia, something like that.  You know what Sal's production piece should have been?  What?  I'm a puppy-haired cunt.  Puppy-haired cunt.  I'm a puppy-haired cunt.  See, I've learned not to laugh over things like that, so he'll be isolated well. 
[02:32:00]  Wow.  I'm a puppy-haired cunt.  That is fucking funny, man.  Wow.  All right.  The next one is from Scott Teague.  Don't make the hinder angry.  Just don't do it.  Just stop.  That's a purring cat. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  I mean, you've got to love this Sal voice at the end.  Funny.  Stop.  Stop.  And then finally, who's the last one, believe it or not?  All right.  All right.  Sal's a faggot, choke on his dick.  Sal's a faggot, open up your neck and radio show.  Why are these in this?  I would like to know.  Sal's a faggot, choke on his dick.  Pick the top 17. 
[02:33:00]  But he's just...  You guys did.  He's just snapping.  Yeah, yeah.  Sal's a faggot.  Sal's a faggot.  That's it.  Steven Singer.  All right.  So you got three.  Number one, number four, and number five.  I either have to hear them again or get some help here.  And the last one also rhymed.  Let's keep that in mind.  Maybe we want to throw that one in.  You want that one to win at all.  How about we take a break and Steven Singer will announce the winner after the break.  Sounds like a plan.  Why don't you grab Steven Singer with the disc and have him in another studio listen one more time. 
[02:33:30]  And then we make love.  And then we make love.  And then we talk to Joe Piscopo.  And then me and Jimmy...  Oh, can I just sit here and watch while you talk to Joe Piscopo?  Yes, you're welcome to stay.  I just want to see your faces.  And have a donut.  Oh.  And then we go see The Hobbit.  Yes, Opie and I are going to see The Hobbit.  I think we really do have to leave a little early.  Yeah, we do, because it's a 3D film.  But I want to get seats because it's going to be a crowded thing, I think.  You think?  Yeah, I don't know.  It might be.  I hate Steven Singer dot com. 
[02:34:00]  Sirius XM.  Follow the Opie and Anthony show online.  Facebook dot com slash Opie and Anthony.  Twitter dot com slash Opie radio.  Twitter dot com slash Anthony Cromia.  And Twitter dot com slash Jim Norton.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sure is.  Steven Singer in studio from IHateStevenSinger.com.  He's got $2,000 for the finalists of the O&A Jingle Slash Audio Contest.  And standing by, Joe Piscopo on the phone in.  Yes.  Oh!  Yes.  So, Steven Singer during the break went into another room and really took it seriously. 
[02:34:30]  We did.  And focused.  And it's time to announce the winner.  All right.  Can we do third place first?  Okay.  You know, we'll do it all fancy and shit.  What number was in...  Number four in third place.  Wow.  Number four.  Track four.  That means George Huckus.  Third place with...  Feet up on the floor like I run the show.  Hokey in my mouth.  Hokey in my mouth.  He rock.  Army nigga.  Nero. 
[02:35:00]  Nero.  He rock.  Army nigga.  Nero.  Nero.  Nero.  Third place.  And you get nothing.  No, we're going to hook up third and second place.  We're going to get him some gifts.  Come on.  Oh!  Breaking news!  We're going to hook him up.  We're going to get him some gifts.  Very good.  Okay.  Second place.  Right.  And this was tough.  Sam and I went back and we talked about this.  I can tell you the logic.  But track five. 
[02:35:30]  The second place?  Second place.  Second place.  So how do we do this?  I guess no one remembers.  So this is second place to run her up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But enough of this palaver.  One roof.  Let's get on the show on the road.  I love this.  Jam.  All right.  Jam.  Big jam.  Tits.  Jelly.  Big jelly.  Tits. 
[02:36:00]  Tits.  What now?  What now?  Everyone's dancing.  Yeah.  I love that.  Now, the only reason is that the logic was there was a couple of other E-Rock songs and 
[02:36:30]  the fatty piggy that's in the back, which I love, which makes it for me, you can't hear  it over the air.  You have to remix it.  If you mix it and that was more out front, that would have been my winner.  Wow.  That was close.  Wow.  A technical error.  I'm just telling you, that's my logic.  We need him a judge for everything.  The judge gives a reason.  He takes it very seriously.  I'm telling you.  And number one.  For the $2,000 courtesy of IHateStevenSinger.com.  Here it is.  We've all waited this long for it.  The buildup.  What is the winner? 
[02:37:00]  Wake up, you radio wizard.  You radio wizard.  The show's begun.  Get up, you radio wizard.  Even though we know you'll get nothing done.  Come on, you radio wizard.  The show needs you here to kill a bit.  Let's go, you radio wizard.  You magically turn everything to shit.  Here comes the radio wizard. 
[02:37:30]  The radio wizard is on his way.  Here comes the radio wizard to take all your hopes and dreams away.  Radio wizard.  What a fucking douche.  Oh, wow.  A lot of controversy.  Roland was singing along and doing the windmill in the other room.  Wait, why is there controversy?  A lot of controversy.  People are mad.  I'm saying, no, no.  Fuck this. 
[02:38:00]  That's the luckiest motherfucker ever.  The other radio wizard one was better.  Which one?  Since he was a...  Not catchy.  Since he was a young boy.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  Well, you know, the decisions are final.  I think Steven Singer took the contest very seriously.  I think Steven's decision is a good one.  Not only...  I'm going to put that on my website.  When they click on O&A, that's what they're going to hear first.  Oh, shit.  He's so proud.  I love it.  That's Andy Schroeder.  Right.  Andy Schroeder wins the $2,000 currency by IHateStevenSinger.com. 
[02:38:30]  And second and third place, we'll give them each $500.  What do you say?  Wow.  Really?  There you go.  We'll hook them guys up.  That's our fucking gifts.  He's giving our gifts away today.  I know, right?  That would have been the money you spent on us today.  No, it would have been much more.  Just to make the other guy feel happy, I'll play both Radio Wizard jingles like 19 times  on the after show.  Oh, perfect.  So that way everybody will be happy.  Beautiful.  Well, I want to thank Steven Singer for stopping by.  This was fun.  The great Steven Singer. 
[02:39:00]  Now, next year, when we do this contest, I want to have it out.  Let's book a place.  All right.  I want to fly the guys in.  A whole day of fun festivities.  We can watch these idiots do it.  Right?  These idiots do it.  I mean, these listeners.  These fine listeners.  No, that would be great.  That would be great.  And you've got to talk to Scott Greenstein today.  I will talk to him.  Maybe if he hears it from you, he'll finally realize.  All right.  I'm putting my seatbelt on.  I'm ready for the next interview.  Well, that would be the great Joe Piscopo. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, Joe.  Joe.  Voice, how are you?  There's Joe Piscopo.  It's been so many years, sir.  We know that voice.  I wanted to come in and see you, man.  I said, you know, I said, I'm out here in Jersey.  I've got to get on a plane.  I'm going off to Arizona.  And I said to Roland, let me get on a plane.  He said, no, I'd call in, but I want to come in and say, I miss you guys.  People go, oh, I'll be an anti-busting your chop.  How long have we known each other?  Since the Eisenhower era?  Yeah, it was a long time ago.  It was a long time.  That is a long time.  I want all your people to know I was there when no one else would show up. 
[02:40:00]  You guys, when you couldn't get arrested, when you got arrested, I was there every time.  I was there every time.  Joe.  W-A-W, is that where it first?  Yes, yes.  Joe, we saw your Showtime special there.  Yes, Club Piscopo.  Club Piscopo.  It's a very great concept you've got going on.  Are you still living in Jersey?  Yeah, I am.  Are you from Jersey?  I need a consigliere, Anthony.  They need to talk, go through all the women problems now from a single guy. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, Jesus.  At my age, I don't know.  I know.  And then Roland told me all the trouble you went through.  I said, oh, my God.  You know, but this is...  It's Roland telling tales out of school?  What's he doing?  He is.  He is.  No, he was very...  Roland's a rat.  A whole family of rats.  Hey, Joe, what happened with Kimberly?  You had a song and everything about her.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  You know what?  And then it ends with domestic abuse.  What the heck's going on in Joe Piscopo's life?  I know.  I know.  I don't believe it.  No, it was like, you know, when you run off with a babysitter, you're going to have problems.  I mean, what can I tell you?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:41:00]  It's right.  You know, I thought, this is it.  I mean, for the long haul.  Oh.  Hey, this is great.  But, man, when they...  I'll tell you what.  It has been...  It has been just a wild ride.  Has it?  So, and now I watch the song.  I can't...  And you know what?  I deserve every bit of ridicule.  You know, Joe, yeah, what...  Did they have to bring that song up in court and be like, oh, boy, look at what he did.  Look at this sap.  Oh, man.  I thought it was a good...  I actually liked it as a song.  Really? 
[02:41:30]  Kimberly?  No.  Kimberly.  Yeah.  Kimberly.  We know each other long enough.  And Jim, how are you, man?  Hi, buddy.  We know each other long enough.  It's an unsecure career category of what the freak was I thinking.  Yeah.  All right.  He's owning it.  He's owning it.  He is owning it.  How many good years did the babysitter give you before she took you for everything?  Yeah.  You know what?  We were together almost for 20 years.  Wow.  Good for you, Joe.  That long?  We got three kids.  But since I broke up, I'm a wild. 
[02:42:00]  Right now, like I said on the show, I got a child at every exit in New Jersey.  Oh, boy.  How old are they?  You know what?  I got 13, 10, 7, and Joe, he's like 67 now.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Hey, Joe, you getting that young pussy now that you're single?  Ooh.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Watch it.  Watch it.  Watch it.  You know what's so funny?  I'm trying to keep it nice with the language.  Of course.  Of course.  You talk to a different...  Yep.  I know.  I know.  And I love you guys.  I really do.  And I miss you guys.  I'm sorry.  But I like, you know me. 
[02:42:30]  I'm like a dinosaur.  Dinosaur.  I always try...  So you mean...  You mean me.  So what do you like to call it?  Skirt?  Are you chasing some young skirts?  Yeah.  I got to tell you.  And Anthony knows.  Yeah.  When you're older...  Can I have him in the studio every day?  He loves my shit.  When you're older...  What's that, Joe?  Sorry, Joe.  When you're older, the chicks, they kind of dig it.  It's interesting.  Oh.  Oh, Joe.  Anthony, when you look like we do, you got to take what you can get.  Well, you know the...  He really wants you on his side. 
[02:43:00]  You know, Joe, the cash don't hurt.  Yeah.  But you got a good body, though.  Was that Schwarzenegger's story true?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everything he does...  Was it too caustic?  Was it too caustic for...  I love Arnold.  No, not at all.  But then you said, like, in person, he came in and said that.  I remember when you used to do Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a great impression.  I like that.  You used to do that one.  Listen, when I went on, when I started working out, and again, it's a long story.  I want to come in so you guys will sit back, we'll hang out, and I'll say everything. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I know, I know.  Because it's too hard.  But it's like, when I would work out, Arnold was there.  He was great.  He was always so supportive.  Oh, man.  He was supportive, man.  Yeah.  He would walk over.  Think about in the day.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Terminator days, he'd walk over to me, and I'd be working out, and we'd just be Arnold and  myself.  Wow.  Kimberly would be spotting me.  You know, I'd have to be the...  Oh, boy.  In Arnold's gym, listen, we're in the World Gym in Venice, California, the sweet smell  of the Pacific, mid-morning, working out, Arnold would look at me, he'd raise his head, 
[02:44:00]  he'd look at the weight on my head, he'd go, go for it.  He was like freaking great.  You know, he was self-supported and everything.  Who is that?  Yeah.  Arnold.  Wait, who said that?  Joe, we missed something.  Arnold, yeah.  Who said that?  That was great.  Say Arnold.  Arnold.  Arnold.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What did Arnold say?  He looked at me, he said, go for it.  Go for it.  Go for it.  Go for it.  Yeah.  And then when I did...  Arnold said that.  Yes.  Arnold Drummond.  When I said, hey, at least my babysitter was good looking.  Yes. 
[02:44:30]  That's a funny line, Joe.  She was a mess, his babysitter.  And Joe, you know, I know, you don't have to worry so much about, you know, offending  anybody like that.  Yeah, he just kind of...  You know, he knows he's...  He knows you're a comic, and it's like when you're doing a set, you're just kind of peppering  in little, just like, lines and stuff.  It's, you know, he knows you're just kidding.  Pepper it in, right?  Exactly.  What do you think of the special and how it came out, Joe?  I know.  Say what?  What do you think of the special and how it came out for you?  You know what?  It's what we do. 
[02:45:00]  I mean, I would have done it live.  I like...  I'd rather require...  I would have shot it live.  I would have liked live, but didn't you?  And I would have kept it tighter.  And then...  And you know what?  We'll talk off the air.  I said, but I...  I said, you know, the Showtime people were great.  The New Wave people were great.  We had fun with it.  The band was great.  You know, the...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, we go around the country doing this stuff.  Really?  And I try to keep it clean, and I do the retro shows now.  And I wanted to plug, too, in Scottsdale, tomorrow night, I'm at the Talking Stick  Resort, which is going to be a blast.  The Talking Stick Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona. 
[02:45:30]  Only the good places for you, Joe.  Joe Piscopo.  Scottsdale, Arizona.  Tomorrow night.  And you're J-R-Z-Y Joe Piscopo on Twitter.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what?  I got to tell you.  I got to tell you something, too.  You know what?  Ever since you guys start getting on my case, which is, again, I know you.  I love you.  And it's all part of the game.  It's great.  Of course.  Joe's a nice guy.  Everyone knows what this is for.  Joe's a great guy.  No.  No, listen.  A wonderful guy.  I do the Facebook thing, which works. 
[02:46:00]  Then I try Twitter, because I'm like an old bastard.  It's like, okay, let me do this Twitter thing.  We'll get into Twitter.  So I just start getting on.  Oh, my God.  They get so vile.  Oh, Joe, you got to watch for that.  Don't let it bug you.  We get abused like that every day of the week on Twitter.  It's terrible.  Ignore that haterade, man.  Ignore it.  Can I say this?  Can I say this?  If you see it, all my good friends out there, Facebook friends, and they listen to you, man.  I bet.  I look forward to listening to you.  I look forward to listening to you.  I look forward to listening to you.  I look forward to listening to you on Facebook.  And then, even on, they tweet me the nicest thing. 
[02:46:30]  But there's three or four psychos.  Oh, yeah.  There's always a couple, right, Joe?  Yeah, a thousand, a thousand psychos.  I hope they didn't misrepresent what we were saying.  Exactly.  Joe, when you were in AC, did you guys shoot one show or two shows?  Two shows.  No, this is funny.  They go like this.  For Showtime, you shot two?  Two shows.  Oh, you did?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So I shot one.  What did you do with the good one?  Yeah.  We nail it.  We nail it.  And, Jim, you'll appreciate this.  First show killed it, man. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And the ovation.  I'm going like this.  Showtime's there.  The New Wave Entertainment.  I said, this is great, man.  So I walk off stage stripping wet.  You know, I'm like the one Newton of comedy.  You know, I'm going, hey, this is good.  Here it is.  You know?  Right.  So I walk off stage, and I go to Brian Volkweig, the producer.  I go, huh?  I look at his eyes.  I'm like, yeah, we nailed it.  And he goes, you ready for notes?  Like that.  Like that.  Ready for notes.  I go, notes.  I haven't had notes since Saturday night.  What?  What do you mean notes?  No kidding.  You know what, though?  Screw the notes.  You know best.  I was like, no.  I tell you.  Well, you know how Rowan gives you notes. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, sure.  Rowan sure does.  What?  Yes.  He's got to give us notes.  We don't understand what he's saying.  Yes.  Funny, right, Joe?  What notes?  Joe, let me ask you.  He's like an exec producer.  What kind of notes does he give the comic?  I'm curious, because I know Brian.  That's a great question, guys.  It really is.  What was one of the notes?  And why did you read them?  You know what he wanted?  What?  More stories.  I said, but, you know, I don't want to talk about people.  They said, no, you've got to tell stories. 
[02:48:00]  Talk about Jay-Z.  Talk about Eddie.  I said, they've heard me talk about Eddie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I liked when you were talking about the band, Joe.  When you were talking about the band, that was good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, those guys are good, too.  Gave us a little insight.  I didn't know you played so many instruments.  You know what?  I don't know how I did it, but I kind of accidentally reinvented myself when, you know,  they go out on the road.  It's just a matter of survival, man.  Yeah, sure.  If I was funny like freaking Norton, you know what I'm saying?  Oh, Jesus.  I know.  But you're a working comic. 
[02:48:30]  You get out there, like you said, a blue-collar kind of comic that's out.  You're always working.  That's exactly right, man.  I'm a working ship.  I got no trailer.  I got no trainer.  I got no $20 million movie.  No.  I go on that stage, and I sweat my ass off for the crowd, man.  Exactly.  That's what I did, you know?  So, yeah, we shot a second show.  We shot it again.  I told more stories.  We put it together.  And it's just something different.  But that's what I do when I go out on the road.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everybody's doing tracks now.  They're doing tracks.  I bring live musicians with me. 
[02:49:00]  Right.  Yeah, it's got that big band sound.  Sure.  Hey, man, it's groovy.  Hey, Joe, you used to do, I remember some of your impressions from SNL.  You used to do that David Letterman.  That was a good one.  Yeah, yeah, I saw that one.  Yeah, we do that on the show.  You got a little Letterman in your dub right now?  You do that on the show.  I know it's early.  I know.  I know.  You're waiting for a flight and all, but.  It's the laugh, man.  It's the Letterman laugh.  My, oh, my.  We're having more fun than humans should be allowed.  Phone the neighbors, wait the kids.  This is an extravaganza. 
[02:49:30]  You won't want to miss.  No, really.  Do it.  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  Yes.  Letterman.  Wow.  To this day, to this day, he's brilliant.  He's the most brilliant of us.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We love him.  We love him.  That's fantastic.  But it's fun.  But, Anthony, tell me about the divorce.  It was bad?  Oh, it was many years ago, thank God.  But, Joe, it wasn't a pleasant experience.  I'll say that.  But you know what?  Once it was over and done with and out of the way, time to move forward. 
[02:50:00]  Move ahead.  And, you know.  Stop.  It doesn't stop in New Jersey.  You never get divorced.  It just keeps going and going.  So, you know what the problem is, too?  You got the kids with her.  So, you're going to have some kind of contact with her all the time.  I didn't have any kids with my, you know.  Oh, man.  So, I haven't seen her in forever, thank God.  And I've been able to, as Opie says, chase that young skirt.  Yeah.  I'm keeping it clean for Joe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anthony, he's chasing diapers.  He's got to be respectable. 
[02:50:30]  Hey, Joe, why the obsession with Jersey?  Go for the babysitter.  Go for the baby.  No babysitters.  No babysitters for Joe.  Yeah, you got to hold on to the mobile when you're coming.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Hey, come on.  Come on.  Joe Piscopo.  Let's keep it high, bro.  Hey, Joe.  Why the obsession with Jersey?  Well, where does that come from?  I think because I was brought up here and everybody's got that work ethic.  From Bloomfield, right? 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, Bloomfield, man.  I was born in Versailles, brought up in Bloomfield, then went up to West Essex High School up there.  And I got to tell you something.  Google Maps.  You're having integrity.  But it's New York as well.  You know, it's like, because after the Sandy situation, guys, and I'm telling you, and we talk about Twitter, you know, and the pain in the neck.  Oh, yeah.  Language.  It was great.  But it was great.  Sandy, it was great.  We stayed on it.  We told folks where you can get gasoline, where there's power, who was going out.  I'm telling you, guys, it was the way Jersey, because you would think, in Jersey, people go, hey, I'm not going over there. 
[02:51:30]  I got power.  You don't.  Well, kiss my ass.  Right.  That's the attitude.  But it wasn't, man.  We all joined together.  And I'll tell you, the good folks in Staten Island, the good folks in New York.  It's too bad you didn't have a beach house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, we went down the shore, and we didn't get that bad.  But the northern Madelokan got hit really bad, you know.  But it was just a pride, the way we all joined together.  Yeah, yeah.  And most people don't look at Jersey like that.  They think it's, you know, every man for himself, kind of, to see Jersey pulled together like that.  They're great.  They're great. 
[02:52:00]  They're a great state.  We all know it.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, yeah.  And when I, check it out, boys, at our age, when I watch Bruce Springsteen.  Slow down with the R-A-H shit.  Now you're getting me mad.  No, listen.  Yes, Bruce.  What, what, what?  Yeah.  Yeah, sorry, sorry, Joe.  Springsteen?  No, but.  How old are you now?  70, 72.  Yeah.  Fucking home run.  Chip is.  What?  We have Chip, uh, Chip is in here. 
[02:52:30]  I gotta ask, uh, Joe, uh, what did we do to you that you just hit us with a low blow there?  Low blow.  You know what?  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I was going to say, because I just, we know you, but I think I got you guys.  I'm the old guy.  I know.  Exactly, Joe.  I think we deserve an apology from you.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I mean, you guys, I've known you guys forever, and I wanted to.  Forever, Joe.  Forever.  I know.  It's okay, Joe.  Joe, we're on good terms.  Hey, Joe, um, can you do some Sinatra?  That's your benchmark, man. 
[02:53:00]  We all know.  Yeah.  We'd be flattered if you did a little Sinatra.  I know, you don't have the band and all that.  A little rap.  Maybe a little rap and a little a cappella of Frank Sinatra.  I do like that.  Oh, man.  I'm just a cat who sings.  I dig hip tunes.  I sang for kings.  I sang in saloons.  I got the world on a string.  Some might say you can do your thing.  Just do it my way.  There we go.  Yeah, like that.  It's like a Frank rap.  Or, uh-oh, uh-oh. 
[02:53:30]  What happened?  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  I don't know.  I'll see you guys.  Hello? 
[02:54:00]  Oh, that's so big.  Hello?  Wait, I lost you guys.  Come back to me.  Come on.  Come on.  What happened?  What happened?  Hello, hello? 
[02:54:30]  Hey, I got you there?  What happened?  Hello, hello, hello?  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes? 
[02:55:00]  Hello, guys.  Hello there.  Come on now.  What?  Where are you?  I got you?  Yeah, good one.  What?  The O.P. and Anthony Show is pretty much over.
