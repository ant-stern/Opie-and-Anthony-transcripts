<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, began with the hosts playfully introducing themselves, including a humorous self-referential nickname, "Sex Vagel."  They mocked those complaining about the Nor'easter, before pivoting to a news story about a florist whose shop burned down on Valentine's Day, speculating on the possible cause.  A Pittsburgh caller praised the show, favorably comparing it to Howard Stern's, prompting a discussion of Stern's recent, seemingly publicity-stunt-like engagement and the contrasting media frenzy surrounding Anna Nicole Smith's death and its legal ramifications, including the bizarre preservation of her body and reports of her underfeeding her baby.  More listener calls followed, adding further commentary on both Howard Stern and Anna Nicole Smith.

The show then delved into a detailed recap of the previous day's broadcast, which involved numerous instances of male nudity and spanking, specifically mentioning the spanking of Eastside Dave and Club Soda Kenny by Ron from Ron and Fez, with Black Earl present in the studio.  The hosts voiced their confusion and concern over their show's perceived "gay" direction, attributing it to a perceived double standard in corporate policies regarding male versus female nudity. This led to a discussion of the "gay or funny" segment, listener anecdotes, and the blurry line between humor and inappropriateness.  They also mentioned a rejected planned bit involving a female guest.  This segment included extensive and explicit descriptions of the spanking, the use of Icy Hot, and the resulting injury. The hosts also discussed their internal conflict concerning the show's direction, juxtaposing it with their ongoing humorous banter.

A phone interview with Nicolas Cage, promoting *Ghost Rider*, followed. Cage discussed his past roles, including *Matchstick Men*, his experiences working with Peter Fonda, and his brief appearance in *Grindhouse*. The hosts joked about his movie roles and perceived aloofness.  This was followed by a discussion of Otto and George, a ventriloquist act who appeared on *The Late Show with David Letterman* the previous night, playing clips from the appearance and discussing Otto's darkly humorous and often offensive jokes. Otto later called in to discuss his experience and the edits made to his set. The segment also included listener calls, discussions about Metallica's cover of "Ecstasy of Gold," Dane Cook's appearance in *Mad Magazine*, and the Joe Rogan-Carlos Mencia feud.

A significant portion of the show featured a Mike Tyson montage of profane outbursts, with Otto as a guest reacting to the clips using equally strong language.  The conversation drifted to Tyson's personal life and past convictions, and a debate ensued about who the scariest person ever is, ultimately focusing on Tysonâ€™s unique combination of physical intimidation and verbal aggression. A listener call contributed to this discussion.  Otto also shared anecdotes about his career and a childhood experience.  The hosts also discussed the deletion of their YouTube videos.

Comedian Ralphie May joined the show, starting with a fabricated story about drugging teachers with Halidol. The conversation quickly turned to graphic descriptions of various sexual acts and preferences, followed by a discussion of Tim Hardaway's homophobic comments and subsequent apology.  The hosts shared anecdotes about their Valentine's Day experiences, including a fight over a dinner order, a hickey, and a poorly chosen gag gift.  A caller expressed a preference for fighting a 300 Spartan over Mike Tyson. A Valentine's Day card from Jimmy to his girlfriend was also read.  The show interspersed these segments with discussions about local news broadcasts, a news anchor falling on live TV, one of the hosts having a hickey, upcoming Pal Talk segments featuring a couple engaging in sexual activity, and a JetBlue flight delay due to weather.  The entire broadcast was characterized by irreverent humor, crude and offensive language, and the hosts' ongoing internal conflict regarding their show's content and corporate restrictions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!  Opie.  I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just hoarse.  James Norton.  Look at this face, how do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Vagel here on the radio with you. 
[00:00:30]  Sex Vagel.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Sex Vagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I am Agniff.  I am Agniff.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Yeah.  Do you want to kiss me?  Yuck. 
[00:01:00]  Hello, exactly.  Yuck.  Stretch one, two.  Oh.  Stretch one, two.  Stretch one, two.  You're doing old school calisthenics?  Like Jack LaLanne?  Good morning.  Hi.  How are you, Anthony?  Oh, dandy.  How are you, Jimmy?  I've been better.  Oh.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  The day after the Nor'easter 07.  I'm sure West Palm Beach is bored out of their skulls.  I understand.  All right, enough.  I get it.  We don't get snow.  I don't understand you.  So occasionally their oranges will freeze down there.  And we have to hear about their oranges freezing.  But you go to the store and there's still oranges and orange juice.  What we got to hear about is some dumb hurricane that barreled through. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  A tornado.  A rogue tornado.  Yeah.  So you understand, right?  Yeah.  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Hope everyone had a fine Valentine's Day.  Oh.  Just before we got on the air, they're doing a story here in New York.  Some guy.  Oh, my God.  I love when this stuff happens.  Some guy who owns a flower shop.  Yes.  He's a florist.  A florist. 
[00:02:30]  His place burned down yesterday.  Oops.  While he's trying to deliver his flowers, it just burnt down.  How does it burn down in the middle of a sleet storm, though?  I don't know.  You would think there'd be enough water around to kind of control it.  Maybe, you know, maybe business wasn't so good.  That's what I'm thinking.  What do I know?  That's what I'm thinking.  Because, first of all, he had two shops.  Did he?  So he extended the arm of his business. 
[00:03:00]  Uh-huh.  Maybe he wasn't making ends meet.  Figures I'll blow one of them out on Valentine's Day.  It'll make the news because, you know, that's just a great story for the news.  Oh, yeah.  They love stuff like that.  And now everyone feels sorry, so they're going to go to the other one and get flowers even today.  So sorry that your place burnt down.  I'm here to buy some flowers to help you out.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You smell like gasoline, kerosene, Zippo lighters.  You don't smoke.  They got video of guys outside the shop. 
[00:03:30]  Like, what happened?  What happened?  They can't get their roses.  Yeah.  Other people sitting there waiting for their delivery, I'm sure.  I would have demanded my roses anyway.  All just charred and just burnt.  Yeah, just get these burnt flowers.  Here you go, sweetie.  Give your sweetie like a smoking bouquet of roses.  Sorry, sweetie.  My sweetie.  Let's say hi to Rich in Pittsburgh. 
[00:04:00]  What's up, Rich?  Hey, nothing.  I was telling whoever answered the phone used to be a big Howard Stern fan and went out and got serious in that.  Yeah.  And once I heard you guys, it took a couple weeks, and then I started listening to you, and then I got direct TV, and then I purchased an XM, so I got you on the cable and the radio now.  Wow, look at this endorsement.  Yeah, you guys are really cool.  I'm glad the big-nosed Jew's gone, and we don't got to listen to him no more, so.  Well, he's too busy planning a wedding. 
[00:04:30]  Who, who?  I'm planning a wedding.  I'm 55 years old, and I'm acting like I'm 20.  Yeah, he kind of gets old, so.  Oh, read your local paper.  Thank you, sir.  Read about Howard's engagement.  It'll make you puke.  Like, what?  You know something?  See, I haven't even heard too much about him anymore.  There's nothing in Pittsburgh about him.  He ain't been on the news.  Well, let me tell you what's going on with Howard.  First of all, Howard Stern is the second most popular guy with the name Howard Stern at this point. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  There's another one called Howard K. Stern that's a lot more famous than Howard is.  He's in the news every day, that guy.  And Howard's not getting the publicity he used to, so now he has to do these crazy things to keep his name in the paper.  Outrageous.  That's the only reason he got engaged, because he has such a massive ego, and it's all about him.  But as he's moving forward with his career on satellite, he's trying to figure out ways to keep his name in the paper.  Yeah, because it just hasn't really happened over there at Sirius.  It's not getting any publicity. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  It's just the way it is.  You could be a huge fan.  I'm not even getting to that.  You could be a huge fan.  You could not be a fan.  The truth of the matter is, it's just that there is no real buzz about it.  Not really making the news at all.  And you announce you're getting married.  That's going to make some news.  But even that, I mean, I think it hit one paper here in New York.  It's getting a little coverage in New York, but not what he wanted.  No.  Because people don't care as much.  And he did it right after the whole Anna Nicole Smith, Howard K. Stern thing. 
[00:06:00]  We know how he works.  Yeah.  He wanted to knock Howard K. Stern out of the papers with his cute little announcement.  Good luck.  It's not going to happen.  That story's got slowly rotting legs as they won't bury the bitch.  Jesus.  Would you bury Anna Nicole Smith already?  What did they say?  They got her on ice or something?  I was wondering, if you guys, I listen to KDKA talk radio in Pittsburgh, too.  There was a news clip yesterday.  I don't know if you guys heard it.  They said he was the, if it was the judge or whatever. 
[00:06:30]  But the guy talked with like a, sounded like a New York accent.  And he was saying how he could keep the body as long as he wants.  And if he wants to, he can go and look at it at any time.  It just, it didn't even sound real.  I didn't know if you guys had that.  Yeah, the judge apparently is telling both sides because one side, of course, wants him buried, wants her buried.  One side wants all kinds of tests done and paternity tests.  And she needs to be available for those for some reason. 
[00:07:00]  Can't just take a tissue sample.  So, in the meantime, she's not being buried.  She's not being buried.  So, the judge said, look, because their concerns are that she's going to decompose.  And she's already decomposing.  And they want to have some kind of an open casket thing.  So, the judge said, look, this body is mine right now.  It's in my custody.  She's, and he said, this baby is on ice.  This baby's on ice.  This baby's on ice, talking about her body.  This baby's on ice.  And I could go down there and look at her, and she'd look fine. 
[00:07:30]  I could keep her for months frozen like this.  So, don't you worry about it, he says.  How creepy is that?  The guy just was being a little blunt with a dead body.  Yeah, he was real arrogant.  It was like he was talking about, like, a popsicle or something.  He could, I mean, do they got her in a refrigerator or something?  Well, they got her in some kind of freezer, apparently.  And this guy was even talking about, you know, I could go down and see her.  I don't most of the time.  Yeah, right.  But sometimes I do, and we thaw her out.  And, you know, you've got to be creepy to have that job. 
[00:08:00]  And you're taking a peek late at night before you lock all the doors.  Frozen implants.  No one's around.  You're taking a look.  He might be a necrophiliac, too.  You never know.  Well, they're keeping the body until at least the 20th, I guess,  because they're getting a DNA sample eventually.  The 20th?  Yeah, supposedly at least until the 20th.  And I know it's funny.  Anna Nicole Smith's mom's going to end up getting the body  and doing whatever she wants with it, bury it wherever she wants.  At that point, you've got to cremate it or something.  All right, Rich. 
[00:08:30]  Hey, thanks for the props.  We greatly appreciate that.  Love you guys.  We'll get down to Pittsburgh eventually.  All right.  All right.  That was a nice endorsement right there.  Also the latest on Anna Nicole Smith, she underfed her baby.  Yeah, that's the whole thing.  Starved her baby was the headlines.  Starved her baby.  See, you're supposed to feed your baby a lot,  and that's why they get all puffy and stuff.  You want to nourish them.  And, you know, to keep them looking cute, I guess you've got to underfeed them.  Yeah.  And Nicole Smith was underfeeding her baby.  She was telling the nannies and everything to not feed them so much, 
[00:09:00]  to not feed the kids so much, so she would be thin.  Yeah.  She was my big fatty like she ended up, I guess.  I don't know.  And now we're learning that there's a doctor from, what, West Hollywood that was getting her methadone while she was pregnant.  While she was pregnant.  Eight months pregnant.  Eight months pregnant.  Oh, this story has legs, doesn't it?  Yeah.  It has legs.  People love this.  And the stupid talk shows, the Insider and all those, Extra and all that. 
[00:09:30]  It's all they talk about.  Oh, my God.  All they talk about.  Nothing new.  They just love.  They had an exclusive interview with Anna Nicole's mother was one last night.  I'm like, exclusive?  I've seen this bitch on the news since her daughter dropped dead every day, all hours of the day.  She's just yapping about this.  What exclusive thing is she going to come up with?  She hates the Howard K. Stern guy. 
[00:10:00]  She wants the baby.  She ain't getting it.  She talks about how wild and free-spirited her daughter was.  Most people just call it being a slut whore.  I love that, yeah.  It's her mom.  What's she going to say?  My daughter was a slut whore.  Mom says free spirit.  The rest of the world says slut.  She's a free spirit.  You know what that means?  But we were also yesterday talking about that whole Howard thing and the fact that if you're working on your second marriage, you're in your 50s, and you got a relatively to you young girl, young girlfriend, younger girlfriend. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  You don't pull this, the big engagement thing, and it's embarrassing.  He did it in the nude, too.  Ugh.  What?  Yeah, that's what the story is.  That's another load of just shocking bull crap.  Everything has to be shocking with you, right, Howard?  Everything has to be shocking.  We took our clothes off. 
[00:11:00]  I demanded that she take her clothes off, and then I took mine off, and then I threw a ring at her.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Stop.  Opie brought up such a great point.  Guaranteed he's going to be a father again.  Guaranteed.  Guaranteed.  It's the only way he's going to be able to keep her.  If you look at the picture on the paper, Opie brought it up.  And when you look at it, he looks like his mother looked back in the 80s.  He looks like an old lady now.  When he used to bring his mom on the show. 
[00:11:30]  He has the same ugly face as his mom.  He's got that same face like his mother.  The only thing that's different is the poodle wig.  And we've heard things about that hair over the years.  It's a weave.  When is that going to come out?  I'm in my mid-50s and not a gray hair.  Really.  It's a miracle.  Yeah, your favorite shock jock goes to the parlor.  The parlor.  That must make you proud to listen to him.  He goes to the parlor to get his hair done. 
[00:12:00]  He probably gets a two-for-one with his mom.  I'm under the dryer another 15 minutes.  Say what you want about us.  We've never went to the parlor to get our hair done.  The parlor.  The beauty parlor.  Yeek.  But it's something you do when you're a kid.  That's something that you do.  I'm sure there will be a big stupid wedding and everything.  But announcing your engagement and stuff, that's one of those.  I don't know. 
[00:12:30]  That was all.  That's your first timer.  When in the same article says his 20-some-odd-year marriage ended, you know, when you were already  married for 20-some-odd years, ah, the novelty's kind of gone.  But you watch.  He's going to have to have another baby now, which is hilarious.  Yeah.  Absolutely hilarious.  That's the reason they're getting married.  And if he does, it's just pull the tapes of him just ragging on Larry King. 
[00:13:00]  And who's the other guy from The Odd Couple?  Tony Randall.  Oh, yeah.  Tony Randall.  Tony Randall.  Anthony Quinn.  Every time one of these guys had a kid, all he did was goof about how it's going to be.  What, are they going to go to the high school, a father-son day of school, and they're 60  years old?  They're an embarrassment to the kid.  Well, I think just about everyone would agree at this point. 
[00:13:30]  He's not believable anymore.  No.  No, it's just not believable.  It's a sad fizzle.  Fortunately for him, you know, hey, God bless him.  He's making a money hand over fist, apparently, over there.  They can't give him enough money over there, which, you know, hey, good for you.  But as far as everything else goes with radio, wow, that is a fizzle.  He has fizzled.  Let's say hi to Freddie in Belmore.  Freddie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing? 
[00:14:00]  Listen, Howard's got a wig 1,000%.  Yeah.  How do you know that Howard has a wig 1,000%?  All right, because if your father's bald, you're going to be bald.  Just look, it's in the genetics.  I've heard it skips a generation.  No, no, no.  1,000%.  All right.  I hear it skips a generation.  I don't think it's a definite on anything.  It's not 1,000%.  My dad, at the end of his life, didn't have much hair.  And I'm one of five boys.  And, like, two of us losing the hair and the other three not.  Man, it doesn't matter. 
[00:14:30]  It actually has nothing to do with your dad.  You get it from your mom's dad.  It's an X-linked gene and cannot be carried in a Y-chromosome.  Oh.  Oh.  Look at that.  Hey, Mr. Education.  I think.  Oh.  We got a smart one working with us today.  What's that?  Wow.  FedEx truck.  It's the icy, all that thing coming at you.  If you're wondering where your flowers are today, there you go.  That FedEx truck didn't make it.  A nice tandem tractor trailer going completely sideways into, I guess, a police car. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Here's the clip of the judge about Annie Nicole Smith's body.  Oh, good.  This court accepts jurisdiction in this case.  A Florida judge will hear evidence in the case tomorrow, but this is what he had to say today.  The body belongs to this judge.  His body belongs to me now.  How do you come off like so?  Like, what's he trying to prove here with this statement?  Be a little cooth.  Jesus. 
[00:15:30]  They're going to go down there and find stuff in her hair and her face.  Yeah, exactly.  They're on her.  Forget it.  All right.  It's big chores.  It's not mine anymore.  How can we blame you?  That's pretty arrogant.  Probably just goes down and yells at us.  Yeah.  Hey.  Just to yell at us.  What do you do?  You were pregnant.  Let's go to.  Oh, go ahead, Jimmy.  No, it's like your team loses.  You just start hitting her.  Oh, like that.  Just.  You start punching her if the Yankees lose a game.  You guys are playing. 
[00:16:00]  You just punch her.  You rib shots.  Let's say hi to Bobby on Long Island.  Bobby.  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you that first caller talking about Howard, he's totally right,  man.  My brother, he ended up getting a serious satellite radio when, you know, Howard made the announcement.  He said the show sucks now and Howard doesn't even want to work half the time, you know?  Well, I think he gets every Friday off, so. 
[00:16:30]  And I think he gets, I think he gets about 13 weeks of vacation a year.  We're trying to take a vacation in May, then they won't even let us do it.  Oh, my God.  The problems that's making.  It's really ridiculous, you know, because I started listening to you guys a couple months  ago.  The show is so much better than Howard ever was, man.  I'm so glad I made the switch, and I'm trying to convince my brother to do it, too.  All right, give him some time.  Yeah, it takes a while.  We're a bit harsh at first listen.  People fall into their habits. 
[00:17:00]  All right, thanks, Bobby.  Thank you.  Doing what you do.  All right, cool.  I appreciate that.  Here's the story with the guy whose flower shop burned down.  Another story we touched on right away here.  Now, this fire couldn't have happened at a worse time.  An entire business and building, a total write-off.  But the owner says he's moving ahead.  But you can't look back.  You have to go.  What's in front of you?  You're going to get an obstacle?  You've got to go around it.  The fire started in the back of the building.  Chas thinks stored paint and aerosol cans helped fuel the place. 
[00:17:30]  But by early morning, it was obvious.  The building, unfortunately, is probably a total loss.  If you see it, they had a major collapse of the roof, a major collapse of the back and  the side wall.  Working at his other location, the Piazzas count their losses this Valentine's Day.  Yeah, you've got to look forward to the insurance check.  Oh, no kidding, man.  It's perfect.  It certainly is.  Who would think that I'd burn down my place on Valentine's Day?  Maybe you're a little overextended. 
[00:18:00]  Who knows?  Something's going on there.  All right, we're just getting warmed up.  We've got lots to do today.  You stay there, and we'll continue, okay?  Yes.  We've got to talk about the JetBlue thing.  Please, please, please, please, please, please tell me Tom Chiasano was on one of these  planes.  Please, please, please, please, please.  Oh, the ones that were stuck for 10 hours.  Wasn't he leaving to go down to Florida on JetBlue?  On JetBlue.  Oh, come on.  Someone please tell me he was stuck for 10 hours.  I hope he's still there. 
[00:18:30]  31 hours, the forgotten flight.  He's on the plane trying to clean his braces.  He fell asleep in the bathroom with his head just resting on the bowl lid, sitting there.  Why wouldn't he be in his seat?  He just got tired.  He's an older man with a gay tie.  He fell asleep.  This JetBlue thing's interesting, and we've all been, most of us have been in a similar  situation, maybe not for 10 hours.  If it's five minutes, I'm annoyed.  Exactly.  We'll get into that and other things. 
[00:19:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Hey, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:19:30]  Wow!  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We got a phone number.  You might want to write it down.  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Very interactive program.  Oh, boy, is it.  The Pal Talk cameras are fired up and working.  Yep.  They did a whole article in the New York Times, what, yesterday?  Yeah.  About how video's being incorporated into radio shows.  Yep.  Not a mention for us.  I know the New York Times hates us, but come on. 
[00:20:00]  Wow.  I know.  Not even a peep.  We went early with the video craze.  Real early.  I got clips on my computer, one of my computers, that we used to put up on our website.  Back at AAF?  Back at AAF.  Back in, like, the mid-'90s.  Mid-'90s, sure.  And, you know, full motion video that we had up the next, you know, that night of what was going on in the studio.  So we were in really early on this whole thing.  Real early.  And then we pretty much filmed everything when we were over at NEW back in the day. 
[00:20:30]  That made it up on websites, up on Foundry Music.  And now, you know, these guys are toting cameras around in the studio, and then they put up stuff on their website.  And all of a sudden, they're in this article like they're breaking new ground.  Like they're the pioneers.  Unbelievable.  The bias in that paper.  No kidding.  Well, we're up to Paltalk cameras where they're on constantly.  You can see what we're doing during the breaks and all.  We don't get a dime for it, by the way.  I get emails every once in a while, like, will you stop plugging Paltalk? 
[00:21:00]  What?  You're taking their money?  We don't get any.  We have to pretty much pay for our accounts.  As a matter of fact, I pay for my account.  Yeah.  We just know.  Pay my own account.  I don't care.  I just want the people to be able to take a peek into the studio.  We just know it's an extension of the radio show.  Yeah.  You've got to start doing other things.  You've got to, like, start incorporating some of this new technology into radio.  The old slobs that refuse to do it or are just holding out for cash, it's not going to work out. 
[00:21:30]  No.  And then we get the fine ladies on Paltalk.  They're wowing us every morning.  It's just wonderful for everybody.  Beautiful.  The room is open and people are just waking up.  It's kind of cool to see who you're talking to.  It's kind of cool to see people, like, making their breakfast and coffee and, well, stepping out of the shower completely new.  That never hurt anybody.  That's nice.  That trumps breakfast and coffee.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Way to make it exciting.  And work up to the nudity.  Nudity.  You get to see toast burn.  Get everything, folks.  I am very concerned with this radio show. 
[00:22:00]  I've got to tell you.  I am very, very concerned.  Where's the instant feedback?  It says it all.  Yeah.  Speaking of being interactive, another fine feature we got.  You go to opianthony.com.  There's a little instant feedback link.  You click it.  You can say whatever you want about the show.  Maybe something you like in or maybe something you hate in.  Usually something you don't like, you write down.  Yeah.  Bastards.  We use lines from our listeners all the time and give them credits.  Go to opianthony.com and check that out as well. 
[00:22:30]  Yes, Jimmy.  Isn't it a widget, too?  Like on Mac, one of the little widgets they have?  Yes, a widget.  You can have an instant feedback widget you can download.  Yes.  Well, Maurice from Texas.  Maurice.  You guys are gay.  So you spank an Irish boy for Valentine.  What now?  Well, we can't say that.  But, yeah, he's basically talking about what happened at the end of the show yesterday.  Yeah.  And I am deeply, deeply concerned, and I don't disagree with the listeners. 
[00:23:00]  Something is wrong with this radio show.  I even said.  And we have nothing to do with it, by the way.  We didn't want to go in this direction.  I said it yesterday.  I said this could be the gayest show we've ever done at the end of the show yesterday over at XM.  And it was just, well, you had Ron and Fez, who are on this very station here in New York.  What time did they come on?  Six?  Yeah.  And had them come on and join us for the last part of our show. 
[00:23:30]  And it just turned into pandemonium.  Yeah.  And it ended up where we are a show that would love to have nude women come in so we could do some kind of hijinks, have some fun, bring a little sauciness to the program for some of our gentleman listeners.  It was, you know, but we couldn't do that.  We can't do that.  Not here, especially.  No, but they have no problem with naked guys is what I'm getting at here.  There was a nude man. 
[00:24:00]  We basically were talking about having a naked woman in the studio.  Ant was just going to give her $100 to be nude.  That's it.  We weren't even going to have her on mic.  And Tom, with his braces, comes running down the hall in a complete panic.  In a tizzy.  That it's corporate policy, blah, blah, blah.  By the way, we're working on that, and we will get our nudity back.  Yes.  But they have no problem when one of the guys gets naked.  Yeah.  What is that about?  Any guy could get naked, and you could slap his ass. 
[00:24:30]  But they keep the ladies out.  What is that about?  Who's making that policy?  That's questionable, isn't it?  Who do they hire down there in Washington to make that decision?  Who's making that final decision?  I think.  The ladies should be kept out of the studio at all costs.  Yeah.  And the gentleman can be brought in and spanked or whatever, anything.  Well, here's the deal.  We had Eastside Dave on the other side of the show yesterday. 
[00:25:00]  And for Valentine's Day, I know this sounds crazy, but he got completely nude.  He hid some stuff in a cup.  Yeah.  And there, I'm looking at the video.  This is just wonderful.  This is going to get the job done for us.  I'm watching Eastside Dave get spanked by another man.  By another man.  This is what we did for Valentine's Day.  That's a love.  There's radio shows out there.  They're doing the hacky bits.  They're marrying couples for Valentine's Day. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, why didn't you think of that?  Fast weddings.  Oh, there was a show that married a gay couple because that's outrageous.  And what do we do?  We spank a guy for Valentine's Day.  How did it mutate into that?  Guy on guy spanking.  How did it mutate into that?  I don't know, but I'm deeply concerned.  Because we didn't start off saying, okay, we're going to end the show like this tomorrow.  Yeah.  You know, yesterday.  It just kind of, all of a sudden, I'm looking over and going, how did we get into this situation? 
[00:26:00]  And I have no answer to that.  There was Dave.  At first, he just had like a button-down shirt on, and he was trying to cover up a little.  I'll tell you how it happened.  It happens the same way with our show.  It starts with a little thing, and then we have to escalate it until we get fired.  Oh, okay.  You're right.  Let's not forget, we spanked Club Soda Kenny yesterday, too.  I think it got tied into that somehow.  Why are we spanking guys?  Oh, God.  Not one person in this organization is going to step up and go, hey, guys. 
[00:26:30]  You realize you're spanking dudes, right?  Why are we spanking guys?  We're all thinking, why ruin a good thing?  Club Soda Kenny messed up yesterday, so, oh, man.  Well, I hope it wasn't me.  You might have to find the audio.  But someone decided that Club Soda Kenny needed a bare-bottom spanking.  Spanking.  So he drops his slacks or whatever the hell he was wearing yesterday.  Their slacks.  And he had bright red underpants on. 
[00:27:00]  Big boxers.  He's saying it wasn't for Valentine's Day, but we're like, come on, Kenny.  Yeah.  Come on.  You think this stuff out ahead of time.  And then we spanked him, and we didn't get it.  I know what it was.  We didn't get a reaction out of him because he's a robot.  Yeah.  No emotion whatsoever.  And then Ron and Fez joined our show yesterday.  And they dragged Eastside Dave in and said, look, you want a reaction.  This guy can't handle pain.  Oh, that's what it was.  He can't handle pain.  We were talking about how Kenny didn't really react because he can handle pain. 
[00:27:30]  And then they said, well, Dave cannot handle pain.  And the way to prove it was to have one of our guys, Baby Bird Video Guy,  the guy that actually laid his head back over a garbage pail  and let Pat from Wynaki vomit into his face.  Well, that video is everywhere, by the way.  Yeah, that video is huge.  Go check it out if you haven't yet.  It's amazing.  Well, he took his hand, dipped it in water so it was wet,  and just started smacking Eastside Dave until he was bleeding. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  He actually had hand marks that were bloody, and he did scream.  Oh, man, did he scream.  And I'm looking around going, what?  He's completely naked except for an Opie and Anthony cup.  By the way, we had nothing to do with him being completely naked.  No, he just all of a sudden started ripping his clothes off.  He decided that he needed to be completely naked in front of nine guys.  Do we have a clip of him being smacked with a scream? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, we're going to get that audio clip.  Oh, it's horrible.  Some of those audio clips.  We'll get it on the radio in a few minutes.  It's worth revisiting.  But the videos and the pictures are up on OpieandAnthony.com,  and I'm deeply concerned.  We've got to get the gay out of this radio show.  How can we get a young lady into the studio to then be spanked over the console  just to undo the horror that was done yesterday?  Yeah, you know how they do, like, exorcisms every once in a while? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, that would be like an exorcism of the gay.  We need some kind of exorcism to get the gay out of this studio.  And it's in Bolt Studios, by the way.  We do a show from two studios every day.  Yeah.  Because there's been a lot of gay action in this studio.  Gay action?  There has.  N-Rock was naked about a week and a half ago.  What happened?  We're ripping hair off his body.  Oh, that's true.  And the bosses, Tom with his braces, he wasn't running in that morning. 
[00:29:30]  No, nothing was being stopped.  If we had a girl with her pants down getting a Brazilian wax,  there would be all kinds of problems.  But why is that?  But a guy naked in studio, the corporate, has no problem with that.  Why is that?  That is bizarre to me.  Why can't we just get a girl?  We like girls.  Believe it or not, we love girls.  We love them.  But something happened with radio that we're like,  well, if we can't get girls in the studio, we might as well do gay stuff. 
[00:30:00]  Don't they understand?  Gays, probably 10% of the population is what they're saying.  And that's including lesbians, so they don't want to hear that either.  So you're really doing niche programming when you're just catering to the gay.  Now, if we catered to the entire male audience, less the gay,  because they don't want to see the women or hear them getting spanked or anything like that,  we'll be winning.  Yeah.  We're getting 90%. 
[00:30:30]  But to kind of defend ourselves a little bit, we have this bit we call gay or funny.  The Eastside Dave thing yesterday was more funny than gay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's going to be tough to talk anyone into, you know, agreeing with us  after they see the videos on the website.  Oh, no.  But there are things that you do with your pals or whatever over the years  where it's more funny than gay.  Is this gay or funny?  Yeah.  And you've got to assess the situation, the context, 
[00:31:00]  and then go, ah, it was funny.  Right.  It wasn't gay.  And sometimes guys try things at parties and stuff and, like, dude, that's just gay.  What is wrong with you?  How is this gay?  Like the old, you know, your pals passed out and, I don't know,  something might end up on his forehead for a quick pic.  That's funny.  It's funny.  But that, to me, is something I would never do at a party with any of my friends.  I understand that.  We used to draw, you know, words on people's heads and stuff like that. 
[00:31:30]  But as far as pulling out the brain and slipping it on someone's forehead.  You didn't do that?  Never.  I can't tell you how many times at parties I've just sat there and pretended I was sleeping.  Jimmy hasn't had a drink in 20 years, but he's passed out at a lot of parties.  Jimmy's passed out again.  He goes to just college parties with a bottle of vodka with water in it.  Make sure everyone sees him drinking a lot of it.  Hey, boy, I'm tired. 
[00:32:00]  Get some fake puke from Spencer's.  Yeah, thank you.  Spencer's lays it to his side.  Next thing you know, the fun begins with Jimmy Norton.  His face is covered.  No, that's funny, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  That's just funny.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I have no problem defending that.  That's funny.  Of course.  We do this bit every once in a while.  You know, if you're out there and you've done something crazy and you're not sure if it was gay or funny, give us a call.  We're experts.  We're experts.  What was the one where a guy was swimming and he comes up for air? 
[00:32:30]  Oh, they have a swimming contest or something.  Didn't we deem that one was gay?  I'm trying to remember.  It struck us as very funny, but it is.  You know, in the summer, like, I don't know, you're hanging out by a pool and everyone tries to do the underwater lap.  Yeah.  Well, these guys were doing the underwater lap and one of their buds jumps in and the other guy goes running to the other end of the pool knowing he's going to come up with a big gulp of air.  Like, right when you hit that other side, you grab the side of the pool, you pull yourself up and just go like that. 
[00:33:00]  So he he positioned himself perfectly in line with the guy that was swimming underwater and pulled down his bathing trunks.  People can figure it out.  Yeah.  And and the guy swam right up to him, pulled his head out of the water.  And you know how your eyes are shut for a little bit and he breathes in and opens his eyes.  And there it's just, you know, an inch away and everyone's laughing and I'm sure the cameras are going off. 
[00:33:30]  That's pretty funny, but it's also pretty gay.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure if we said that was gay or funny.  Well, you're laughing a lot.  So I think it's funny.  You know, now I'm starting to think it's funny, more funny than gay.  But I guess what we have to do for our faithful listeners is just acknowledge that there's there's a gay thing happening here and we're not happy about it.  And we we blame corporate.  Yes.  We blame Tom and his braces. 
[00:34:00]  That's who I blame today.  And I pray that he was on that jet blue plane for 10 hours.  I was stuck on the runway for 10 hours.  He was he was leaving yesterday for a little long weekend.  A job away from this joint in Florida.  Yeah.  Warm weather.  Yeah.  Just stuck on the runway.  Oh, that'd be great.  Because you know what?  We want we want naked girls on our show.  We want women time to time.  We're not talking about a daily event.  Yeah.  Just one.  If the situation calls for it, get some girls up here like the old days. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  Let's say hi to Charlie Philly listening to us on WISP.  What's up?  Obi, Anthony, Jimmy.  What's up, boys?  Hey, are you Charlie?  Are you dopes down there still listening to Preston and Steve?  I don't know.  I don't.  I listen to O&A on XM.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Gotta love it.  Well, support YSP for us, too, will you?  Because Preston and Steve are getting away with murder down there still.  Effing murder. 
[00:35:00]  Hack radio is beating us in Philly.  Yes.  I hate to admit it, but yes.  That is happening.  More gay radio, I think we have to do, and that will put us over the top.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's up, Charlie?  Well, I just wanted to say, you know, every now and then, gay is gold.  I mean, it wasn't like there was any bone smuggling going on yesterday.  No.  You know, but all these guys calling in and writing in an email and saying, oh, it's  gay, it's gay, it's gay.  Bring your girlfriends, your wives up to the studio.  Let them do a show for the boys. 
[00:35:30]  Come on.  No, I understand that.  You know, I do understand that it was very good radio yesterday, but I'm concerned.  Ant's concerned.  Jimmy's not concerned.  No, I don't care.  He couldn't be happier at this point.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold on.  I could be much happier.  I'm not a homosexual.  What a man does for a laugh.  See, Jimmy does a lot of funny, not gay, right?  Hi, Daddy.  Just keep laughing.  As long as you're laughing, this is funny, not gay. 
[00:36:00]  As long as you're LOLing.  Get out of here with your arms like Kobe and you're a skew wig.  Beat it, Mr. Miss.  Skew wig.  I understand that.  It was pretty good radio yesterday, but I'm scared of the pattern that is going on.  Yeah.  Yeah, and the double standard.  And the double standards, right.  We had a great bit that actually XM told us we couldn't do, which amazed me because last  I looked, you could do whatever the hell you want on satellite radio.  Yeah.  We had an unbelievable bit they said no to.  So your blank has talent. 
[00:36:30]  So your blank has talent.  Yep.  And we were going to do some unbelievable things with the blank.  With the blank.  Blank.  The lady would come in.  That's, yeah.  Yeah, well, of course.  If you can't figure that out, then go listen.  Well, you know, a lot of people.  Go to the pop station in your city if you can't figure out what blank means.  I think just by saying, so your blank has talent.  Yeah.  I think people would be a little confused.  Really?  Yeah.  They're that stupid out there.  Well, you didn't even say if it's a guy or a girl.  Well, then you said a girl comes in.  Yeah, a girl comes in.  And, yeah, the guys would have to come up with various ways to show the talent that can be expressed using certain areas. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  That's all.  That's all.  And somebody had some great ideas.  Some of our guys.  Great ideas.  And it got squashed.  Because some dopey broad died.  That's why.  The whole we for a wee contest screwed everything up. 
[00:37:30]  Dopey broad dies from water.  And we all have to suffer.  Ugh.  Could just easily happen in a tub or a shower.  Right.  A rowboat with a cinder block.  Hey, my stomach hurts.  Then stop drinking water.  Stupid.  You lose.  Out of the bathroom and live.  All right.  Hey, Charlie, thank you.  Guys, thanks a lot.  Great show, Jimmy.  I'll see you tomorrow night, buddy.  Oh, you coming to Lancaster?  Lancaster.  Yeah, Jimmy's going to be in Amish country over the weekend.  Charlie, do us a favor and just support the local station a little bit for us. 
[00:38:00]  Well, I have a YSP WOW sticker on the back of my truck.  There you go.  You're a good boy.  Some of these radio shows are getting away with murder.  They just stink.  Well, maybe everybody's into the letter of the day.  Oh, instead of real radio.  The what?  No.  It's the letter of the day.  What's the letter of the day?  Don't tell me.  Yeah.  Come on, Anthony.  You know all that hack radio.  Letter of the day.  You get five letters.  Spell the word.  You win a Preston and Steve shirt.  Hoo, hoo, hoo. 
[00:38:30]  Ew.  That's what's beating us in Philly?  A letter?  Open the effing window.  A letter of the day.  And then it spells out a word after a week?  Exactly.  I mean, it's...  And what do you win at the end?  Okay.  I want to start that.  C.  Today's letter is C.  I'll give you a little clue on tomorrow's.  You.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's play.  We're going to play the same game.  We'll have fun.  We'll have fun for everybody in Philly. 
[00:39:00]  We'll start Monday.  Our words will be a little different.  Let's do that.  Yes.  Our words are going to be a little different.  We're ripping off letter of the day.  Our words aren't going to be, like, fluffy.  No.  And sunshine.  Trust me.  Ta-ta's.  That's the word.  Ta-ta's.  Ta-ta's.  They're outrageous, Jimmy.  All right, Charlie.  Help us out a little bit down there, will you?  Okay.  All right.  We'll do.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mike in Florida. 
[00:39:30]  Mike, what's up?  Hey there, Mike.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  What's up?  When you guys come to Tampa on Free FM.  I got my accent down here, but you guys got to come down to Tampa.  Tampa would be a cool market to be in, yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe someday there.  What's up, Mike?  Yeah, I got a gay or funny for you guys.  Gay or funny?  All right.  We'll decide.  Gay or funny?  Me and all of my fireman friends are out going to other firehouses for parties, and me and  my one buddy are pretty drunk, and we decide the next firehouse we go to, we're going 
[00:40:00]  to act like we're a gay couple, and we held hands the whole time, and stayed together  and called each other, you know, honey and snooky-boooky and all that sort of stuff.  Gay or funny?  Gay.  No.  Gay.  It's gay.  It's not.  Why?  I disagree.  Because the joke would run its course immediately.  You would get the initial, like, oh, that's funny, look, they're kind of acting a little  gay, but then to just keep in character, I think you guys kind of like each other. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, man.  I've held hands with a man before.  Mm-hmm.  Me and Jimmy hold hands getting off planes every once in a while.  Do you?  Absolutely.  That's cute.  We like to play, let's see who, let's go first.  That's what ends up happening, because he, I'll grab his hand as a joke, or he'll grab  mine as a joke, and then that should last like two or three seconds, but we're both stubborn,  and then I'm thinking, man, he's not going to let go, because he likes to make it as uncomfortable  as possible for everybody.  I'm like, you know what?  Of course. 
[00:41:00]  I got OCD.  I'm not letting go.  Next thing you know, we walk all the way to star base.  Wow.  I like how Opie tries to turn it into a manly challenge.  Hey, he wouldn't let go.  I wouldn't let go.  We see.  Yeah.  You know, made a best man win.  Next thing you know, separate them.  And then Danny got me really bad at the Mets game.  We've talked about that.  Have we ever talked about that over here?  I don't know.  We have?  Okay.  I went to the Mets game with my girlfriend, and I had an extra two tickets. 
[00:41:30]  I was trying to give them away, and I could only get one person.  That was Danny, so there was an empty seat for the game, whatever.  And we had low box seats almost on the field, which were awesome.  Somebody gave me some fine tickets, and then we're leaving, and I actually turned and went  and grabbed my girlfriend's hand.  I knew it was her hand.  No doubt in my mind.  And I started walking out of the place, but it's like single file, so she's behind me.  You know the story.  And somewhere along the line, they did the old switcheroo. 
[00:42:00]  Next thing you know, I'm holding Danny's calloused hand.  And they switched like she wanted to switch hands?  Yeah, yeah.  So she let go, and instead of grabbing your hand again, Danny grabbed your hand, and now  you're holding hands, dragging him up the stairs.  Could be one of the most embarrassing moments ever, because it was right after we got  back on regular radio.  So we were in the news a lot.  Our face was everywhere.  So there was a lot of recognition going on.  Hey, yo. 
[00:42:30]  So I'm walking out of Shea Stadium, and I think I got Lindsey's hand.  People are taking pictures.  This picture's out there somewhere.  Oh, how embarrassing.  Not one has surfaced yet.  And I'm hearing people go, hey, open.  I'm just smiling and waving.  Holding Danny's hand.  It's a really nice day at the stadium.  Yeah, great day for baseball and a good gay relationship.  Holding my best gal's hand.  And I get the exit, and you're underneath there or whatever.  And I turn around to, I guess, hug or kiss Lindsey. 
[00:43:00]  And I turn around, and that's when I found it was Danny.  So how long did you kiss?  And incidentally, you were walking with a guy with a goatee.  I wonder who they thought that was.  Yeah, right.  Oh, they do get along, don't they?  Oh, damn.  I didn't even think of that.  Yeah, a couple of fruits just celebrating the return of radio at the game.  Hand-holding.  Holding hands.  Yeah, well.  All right.  Buying hot dogs and not eating them.  We got the JetBlue story. 
[00:43:30]  Well, not chewing them.  We got Otto and George on Letterman.  Huge, huge night for one of our pals.  And also, I guess we'll have the audio of the gay show hopefully by next break.  Yeah.  Well, we got some guy on guy spanking for you.  A lot of gay or funny on the phone.  Because this is what corporate wants from your edgy radio show, guy spanking other guys.  Boy, they get it, don't they?  Thanks.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:44:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's get right back into it.  Yeah.  We have lots to do today.  And we go to break and we're discussing, you know, we got to talk about the JetBlue thing.  And Otto and George on Letterman.  And we got guy on guy spanking audio for everybody because that's hot.  Yeah.  Is it?  When?  When did that happen?  When is corporate going to wake up?  Not a problem in the world.  When are they going to wake up and help us out here?  Not a care in the world that that was going on. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, it just arrived, by the way.  Thank goodness.  Oh, can't wait to get to the guy on guy spanking audio.  And look who brought it.  Your hand-holding buddy from the ball game.  That's why it took so long.  You really wanted to listen to the audio.  Yeah, let me make sure this is good.  I want to play it one more time.  I got to make sure I get the hotter clips for everybody.  Oh, God.  Anyway.  Yeah, so I'm sitting here and Jimmy's talking to me.  We both know us at the same time.  Yeah.  He turns his head and I'm like, what? 
[00:45:00]  Maybe the chain he's wearing around his neck is chafing him or something.  But no, I saw a hickey.  I have not seen a hickey.  How old are you?  25.  That's too old for a hickey.  I'm small.  It's so funny.  It's like, and then Opie brought up a great point.  He went into the bathroom and I couldn't help but just keep talking about you and your hickey.  I'm like, he's so far behind with relationships. 
[00:45:30]  That's your problem.  And it's not a problem as far as that goes, but it could be in other aspects of your relationship.  Wait, just to let everyone know.  Sorry, some news guy just fell on live TV.  That's on YouTube.  We've known Jimmy for getting close to 10 years now, eight years, something like that.  He's never really been in a relationship.  He was in a relationship with one chick that was just completely nuts.  Yeah.  But besides that, no real relationships.  And now Jimmy's in love.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  It's a relationship that you're kind of behind the times a little bit.  I can't help it.  She's just, you know.  Dude, you get hickeys when you're in a relationship in 11th grade.  It's an 11th grade where you're not even in like a senior high school relationship.  You're in like a sophomore or junior.  That's like the relationship you're in.  You're like in high school where you're in love.  Well, she is.  And you want to go to school with a hickey to show off that you're getting some. 
[00:46:30]  You go to school with a hickey and it's like, dude, what happened last night?  Well, I don't kiss and tell, but let me, you know, if I got this, it's the ones you  can't see, my friend.  I never realized it, dude.  I didn't even know I had it.  Yeah.  No, I'll give them to her too, but I'll bite her.  Like, that's where the high school part ends.  Because for Valentine's Day, she wore crotchless little underpants.  Oh, really?  Oh, they were fantastic.  Wowie kazowie.  Yeah.  Be careful.  This is getting a little too hot for corporate.  Yeah.  Just say it was a guy. 
[00:47:00]  Just say it was a guy.  Assless chaps.  And we'll be fine.  We'll be completely fine, right?  Right, boys?  I administered a very firm spanking.  Yeah.  And then the activities commenced.  Wow.  I didn't even realize I had an hickey.  She got you.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  She almost had a mark on her neck, a ligature mark from strangulation when she snapped at  me at dinner.  What?  Me and Oprah, Oprah needs to eat.  He just, he can't go out eating.  He gets crazy.  I'm like, well, you're not the only one.  I just, I realized we were at dinner last night.  I got a blood sugar thing. 
[00:47:30]  I got to eat constantly in the morning.  It wasn't, it was just a sushi thing because we both had to go and do stuff and we're having  sushi and she's getting, she's looking at the menu and I'm like, yeah, on the Saturday  night traveling, the shows on XM.  I'm like, yeah, Saturday night shows.  I'm looking at the menu.  I'm reading the menu.  Oh, was she serious?  Oh yeah.  It was, it was so awful.  I thought it was a parody of a C. I'm like, you didn't just say that.  She's like, I'm sorry.  I just, I haven't eaten.  I'm sorry.  Because that would be funny if you just strike up a conversation and someone goes, I'm reading 
[00:48:00]  the menu and, and makes like they're mad.  That's how awful it was.  And then she immediately apologized.  I just kind of sulked through dinner.  Oh no.  Your Valentine's day dinner.  Yeah.  We made up some.  I went to a restaurant last night and just saw all the couples that are miserable that  were out because it's Valentine's day.  Obligatory night out.  You look around the restaurant and you can just tell who's miserable and they're just  doing it because society tells us this is the day for love. 
[00:48:30]  You know, we go out to dinner all the time cause that's what you do in Manhattan and we  were having a, we were having a fine dinner and talking and stuff.  And we started looking around the room going, look at all these miserable couples.  No one's talking.  And there's a rose on every table that just sitting there doesn't mean anything.  Ah, what time is it?  Got to get out of here.  Unbelievable.  Got things to do.  You got to sit there.  But Jimmy's got a hickey today.  Yeah.  We exchanged gifts.  I gave her a little recorder and some other $50 iTunes thing and I bought flowers. 
[00:49:00]  An old flute recorder or?  No, no, no.  Here you go.  Do, do, do.  It was an old lady who works in the court system.  That's Jimmy's girl at dinner.  Thanks.  I love my gift.  Not that kind of recorder?  No, no.  One that records audio.  Oh.  Good old audio.  Like a tape recorder.  Just give me a cool.  But digital.  A cool gift too.  It was like a pack of question and answer cards. 
[00:49:30]  Like little questions.  It was like a pack of like relationship question cards.  Why didn't you bring them?  I don't know.  Like what's your favorite band?  And that's supposed to spark conversation.  And then you say Black Sabbath.  No, I say Sex Pistols because he killed his girlfriend.  I wish you brought the cards in.  I'll bring them in tomorrow or Monday.  Every Monday.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you're going to Lancaster.  And that's supposed to spark questions that would spark a conversation that then you guys like would converse. 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  They didn't, you couldn't find the card that said, why did you emasculate me at dinner?  That one wasn't in there.  Yeah.  I'm reading the menu.  Wow.  No, it wasn't, it was like, it was, it was a sitcom moment.  She looked up, I'm reading the menu.  Like for real.  Oh, and her hand went, did her hand go?  It was awful.  And she just needed to eat, you think?  The blood level was dropping?  Yeah.  She needed to eat and, you know, be a human.  The blood level would have been dropping when you sliced the throat.  Well, me and my girlfriend, we exchanged cards. 
[00:50:30]  I didn't get a card.  We went one, two, three, and we exchanged cards.  Oh, one, two, three.  And we handed each other the same card.  Really?  Think of the odds of that.  What are the odds?  And it wasn't a Hallmark card where, you know, the odds are pretty good.  The odds are that you probably both went out last minute and that's all that was left.  No.  Or they haven't had a card that says, hi, Opie and Lindsay on the front of it. 
[00:51:00]  One card, same card from two different places.  Really?  It wasn't even the same card store in the neighborhood.  What was it?  It was obviously a very nice card.  That's kismet.  Pretty cool, huh?  All right.  It's whatever.  It's a sweet.  I almost showed my soft side.  What am I thinking?  What did the card say on the cover?  What was the front of it?  You don't have to say what you wrote, but what was the front of it?  Sweetie pie.  Something like, when I say I love you, this is what I mean to say. 
[00:51:30]  Or this is what I'm thinking.  I don't even remember.  Then you open the card and there's the things that you're thinking?  Yeah.  Well, then I added stuff.  Crossed up out, added, amend the card.  Amend.  Except when you do this.  Send it off to Bob.  So we can amend.  No kidding.  I love the way you smile and you put an asterisk.  Except when you're on your period.  I'm going to put you down the stairs.  I love the way you do it.  Well, we got hot, man-on-man spanking audio for everybody. 
[00:52:00]  Great.  I hope you were listening earlier.  We don't feel like re-explaining this.  This is what we've heard.  But for some reason, corporate has no problem with us spanking guys on the bare bottom.  When there's men.  But when it comes to naked girls, they have a real problem.  Like Tom, one day, he got so pissed he ran in and was ready to stop the show  because he really thought there was a girl going to do something with a cigarette.  Yeah.  Comes running in with his braces to shut down the show because it's corporate polio. 
[00:52:30]  Because it's corporate policy not to have naked women on the radio right now.  We're fighting this.  Believe me.  And then I'm getting emails from people.  Kid Chris down into, well, I don't want to blow his spot up.  But it's a double standard.  Supposedly he's getting girls naked.  And now I'm hearing the radio chick here in New York.  She's still getting girls naked on her show.  But for some reason, because we've got the big boss that has to be in every day because we're bad boys,  he comes running down the hall as soon as he thinks there might be nudity and tries to shut us down. 
[00:53:00]  Dude, we should do it anyway.  I mean, what are they going to do?  That's what I've been saying.  Just bring a girl up here.  Get a girl up here.  Well, he's still stuck on a JetBlue flight, so today would be a perfect day to get girls down here.  How about the headquarters strip club?  And put one of those strippers in here just to run around naked.  To run around naked.  Get a girl in here today.  I would love to get fired again because we had a naked girl on our radio show.  I would love for the papers to write on that.  Oh, that we didn't do anything.  How about a naked girl circling this giant console just yelling, duh, like a retard. 
[00:53:30]  I want a naked girl making retard noises.  Hey, I got a hundred.  I got a hundred.  I got a hundred.  Cool, that's two hundred.  That's two hundred.  I'll hand it over.  Yeah, you'll give it to the girl.  Can we work on one of those dopey strip clubs?  Or like, I'm dumb and blonde, I'm dumb and blonde.  I'm dumb.  Just, uh, I won't, duh.  I'm dumb, duh, I'm dumb, duh.  Call one of those strip clubs.  Get a girl down here.  All right.  Very good.  Well, but they don't have a problem with guys getting nude, so for your listening pleasure, 
[00:54:00]  this is Eastside Dave from the end of yesterday's show.  It's just a few clips.  Everyone's talking about it today on the message board, so what the hell?  Ron and Fez came in to help out the radio show.  They brought in Eastside Dave, and this is what happened.  And, copy of honcho.  We can give you a spanking.  We found something that's good at spanking today.  You want a spank?  How about a spank to end it all?  No.  Who's this the plan?  Patrick does.  Oh, uh, just to set this clip up, we got Black Earl in studio, and he's playing the guitar 
[00:54:30]  for us.  Yeah, because he was trying to showcase his talents, of which he has none.  Right.  And, uh, what are the odds that we will have to dump out of something that they missed  on this?  Definitely.  Yeah.  There will be a curse or something will happen that will have to be dumped.  He does a good job of spanking.  He spanked Club Soda Kenny earlier.  Yeah.  Made him f*** his pants.  Eastside Dave has zero pain tolerance.  You want to bring him in, we can spank him.  Oh, yeah.  He panics.  He screams like a woman. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, it'll be the best way to send you out.  All right, here's the deal.  Ron suggested Eastside Dave get spanked, okay?  So you're calling Ron gay?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have to.  I have to.  So this is Ron's fault that our Valentine's, the big Valentine's Day show ended with a  guy completely naked getting spanked yesterday.  By another man.  By another man.  I blame Ron from Ron and Fez.  Yes.  Absolutely.  I gotta go with you on that one.  Here's the next clip.  I got a problem. 
[00:55:30]  On our show, we spank, you know, bare bottom.  No problem at all.  Okay.  No problem at all.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Now.  Wow.  Now your argument just went out the window, Opie, because.  Not only did you suggest it, you had a problem.  You had a problem.  It's gotta be bare bottom.  Bare bottom just sounds so, like, institutionally gay.  Yeah, well.  Like, discipline at a boys' school.  Dude, you're like, on this show, we spank bare bottom like it's common knowledge. 
[00:56:00]  All male ass did a spank, ladies and gentlemen.  Hey, hey, hey.  It's bare as you know.  On this show.  Like, everyone knows.  Yeah.  You do it your way on your show, but on this show, we do it bare bottom.  We make sure it's really gay on our show.  God.  Can you hear that one again?  Can you hear that one again?  Ah, no.  Yeah.  The tape blew up.  I don't know what's.  I think we should.  Look, it's the CD.  The tape.  The tape is spinning out of control.  Look.  Look, it's spilling out of the machine.  The tape.  I got a problem.  On our show, we spank, you know, bare bottom. 
[00:56:30]  No problem at all.  Okay.  No problem at all.  Oh, wait a minute.  I think Jimmy said it first.  I did, but I was.  Oh, did you?  Because you were saying.  He didn't say bare bottom at all at first.  No, no, no.  But he was saying it naked.  I mean, I was.  It's almost like.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  You were going to.  You sat on our show, spank, spank.  And then Jimmy jumped in.  That's what your problem was.  No, but you said it, but he did.  Okay, I just pitch.  Here's the thing.  If you look at a stupid now, I go, hey, shirt, it's on.  You're going to go flat.  Like, it's like.  I was a flat.  Okay, but I mean, I just know that we have to get off. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, we have to be honest here.  I'm saying.  I'm just saying.  If you're.  And just a rich script.  Yeah.  Jimmy, we spank.  And then Jimmy would have said bare bottom.  Yeah.  Bradley.  Would have been here.  Probably.  I also would have pointed out that Diane Sawyer looks like Tanner Boyle.  Stupid hairdo.  What happened to her?  Yeah, her voice.  She stanked the dopey hair, too.  You're 90.  Just act like an old lady, would you?  All right.  So, yeah.  I said bare bottom. 
[00:57:30]  All right.  It was just, you know.  Yeah.  Listen.  Let's listen.  Listen in.  Listen.  You'll hear.  I got a problem.  On our show, we spank, you know, bare bottom.  No, right.  You said.  Wow.  You got in before I got in.  Yes.  But it was together.  Jimmy got in before.  I won the race.  I think Opie was going to say something else.  And you influenced him.  No.  No.  No.  Yes.  I'm putting the gay on you.  I'll accept half the gay.  But, I mean, it was him.  I blame Hickey Boy.  Which half?  You should have seen how I got my Hickey. 
[00:58:00]  We were watching TV.  I just turned my head to the left and I went, hey, hey, hey.  Did you look around for a turtleneck to go to school in?  That was the noise she made.  She was like.  I'm sorry.  I snapped at you.  All right.  I got a problem.  On our show, we spank bare bottom.  No problem at all.  Okay.  No problem at all. 
[00:58:30]  Hey, Dave, look at me.  I'll get into this.  Make me.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't look at it.  Too far down in front.  Don't look at it.  Don't look at it.  Oh, my God.  What's the big deal?  There is no big deal.  Dave.  Errol, there's your little white.  You want a little white girl?  I told it here.  See, we had nothing to do with him deciding he needs to be naked for his bare bottom.  No.  Spanking, okay?  Right.  You could spank bare bottom.  We got to defend ourselves a little bit here.  By just pulling your pants down.  Right.  That keeps it safe for everybody. 
[00:59:00]  A little bit.  He keeps it safe for everybody.  He decided everything was going to go.  Yeah.  Except a button-down shirt, which barely covered anything.  Yeah.  And then that wound up going.  Well, then we needed to cover up because it was getting a little weird in there.  Yeah, it was very uncomfortable.  So then this is what happened.  I want him to put his b**** in the Opie and Anthony cup.  I put your b**** in the Opie and Anthony cup.  There you go.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, quick.  That was like a hidden b****.  Put everything in.  Put everything in.  Put everything in. 
[00:59:30]  You got to get your b**** in your b**** in there.  There you go.  That b**** in there.  Oh, God.  You got your b**** in your b**** in your b**** in your b****.  Oh, my God.  You guys have been in male locker rooms before.  It's like a sports.  I think you have a hernia, too.  What's the one?  Oh, he's got a bump.  I forgot to be shaved down, too, so you guys can see some of my orange.  My orange b****.  When they say we're a cup, they don't mean a tumbler.  Isn't regular radio fun, everybody?  Isn't it just fun? 
[01:00:00]  You know.  Fun for everybody, isn't it?  When we're over there just talking.  Yeah.  You don't realize how many inappropriate things we say that would never make podcast radio.  But apparently, it's every other word.  Well, wow.  Look, you know, in a weird way, those beeps make it kind of funny, though.  Yeah.  You kind of know what's happening, but.  All right.  Just a man with minuscule genitals standing there with a cup.  Awful.  Are you really a grown-up?  I wanted to see his ID when I saw him naked. 
[01:00:30]  And finally, we got to the big man-on-man spanking for our Valentine's Day show.  Eastside Dave, in this next clip, gets spanked, and you'll hear it right after these messages.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:01:00]  In the middle of man-on-man spanking.  For your pleasure.  Yeah.  For the people still listening.  Why?  And we gave you a chance.  Yeah.  We gave you a chance.  We gave you the big tease before the spots.  We told you what's going to happen next.  Why are you still listening?  Run.  Sometimes you keep listening because you really don't know what you're going to hear next on the show.  We blatantly told you, this is what's going to happen next. 
[01:01:30]  This is your opportunity to go somewhere else.  You're going to hear a man being spanked by another man.  That's right.  Let's get right into it so we can move on.  By the way...  Just say, let's get to it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The way you put it, it sounds a little...  A little, uh...  Yeah.  Worse than it is.  By the way, how uncomfortable was it when we saw Tom here today?  Holy Jesus.  We all thought he was in Florida. 
[01:02:00]  We're sitting here just bashing him.  The cowards we are.  JetBlue had a huge problem yesterday.  And our own boss here, Tom Chiasano, was flying out to Florida for a long weekend.  Yep.  He said goodbye and everything.  He said, I'll see you guys Tuesday.  Taking a few days.  Mm-hmm.  So we thought we were pretty safe.  So we beat him up pretty bad about his braces and hoping that he was on one of those planes.  Hoping he was stuck on the plane.  He was just still sitting there.  And we're laughing because the abuse was even worse during the commercial break.  And all of a sudden, I look and there he is at the door. 
[01:02:30]  Like, hey, wait a minute.  What's he doing here?  Apparently, he couldn't get out.  And then we had to go, oh, we're just kidding.  We're just trying to make good radio, Tom.  With that tie on, he's got his hand up like Frankenfurter when he first walked in in Rocky Horror.  Hello.  Anyway, here we go.  Eastside Dave gets his spanking for our big Valentine's Day show yesterday.  Wet it up real good.  Don't dry it.  And get a nice flat smack on that.  Game on.  Here we go.  Way to go.  Clear the cheek. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  What happened?  Mind the cup.  What happened?  You getting excited?  Why are you hitting the cup?  All right.  Hold on.  That would f***ing hurt.  That's why I hit the cup.  This is real.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's a half a retard.  He's a cincular.  Oh, man.  Turn around.  Look what he did to his ass already. 
[01:03:30]  Tell me this isn't real.  Take a look.  Oh, he broke it open.  Holy s***.  Your ass is bleeding.  Earl, you get closer.  Touch it.  Earl, look at his ass.  Look at his bloody ass, Earl.  Earl's ready to paint.  Wow.  You s***.  It's bleeding.  Earl, rub his ass, will you?  Yeah.  His butt cheek was...  His butt cheek?  How old am I?  His ass cheek?  It was his cheek.  Did Earl keep that clean down the hall?  We're all right?  It was his left cheek was like chop meat. 
[01:04:00]  Because he's a really pale Irish.  Very Irish, yeah.  So it just...  He's got skin like rolling paper.  He's one of those see-through Irish.  Yeah.  And yeah, he hit him so hard.  Patrick Duffy had hit him so hard that it actually broke the skin.  Yeah.  And the video and pictures are up on opiananthony.com.  Getting viewed pretty heavily right now.  So there's...  Oh, yeah.  A lot of freaks out there need to check this out.  All right. 
[01:04:30]  Well, to continue.  That was the first one?  Yeah.  Thank God there's more.  Wait, what's going on over there?  There's a little alcohol.  I just feel like...  A little alcohol.  A little alcohol.  A little alcohol.  Something bad's going to happen.  We want to keep it clean.  We want to keep it clean.  All right.  Off you go.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Take it, brother.  Like a man.  Two in a row.  Go ahead.  That wasn't that bad.  What?  What happened?  Dude.  You. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, f***.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot to tell everyone.  I snuck the icy hot to Pat in the middle of the man-on-man.  Yes, sir.  He rubbed the icy hot on his hand and slapped him with that right over the broken skin.  Yeah.  You know, honestly, because Pat Duffy has big, meaty, dumb, Hetfield hands.  Oh, yeah.  And I was, I spank my girlfriend sometimes.  You have to. 
[01:05:30]  And I'm like, I was wishing I had hands like him.  I'm like, that guy has got spanking hands.  That's the way you're supposed to crack an ass.  Did your girlfriend comment on how small your hands were and you got upset?  Yeah.  And how big other men's hands are?  No, she didn't.  Oh.  Oh.  I hit a sore spot.  No, you didn't.  It's all right.  I mean, who cares?  You know?  I'm at the menu.  The menu.  Reading.  Reading.  Reading. 
[01:06:00]  He sounds like a cartoon character going off a cliff.  He does.  All right.  Let's get back to this.  We just need to get through this.  Just, let's just get through this.  Icy hot.  We got him with Icy hot.  Icy hot.  We got him with Icy hot.  We got him with Icy hot.  We got him with Icy hot.  We got him with Icy hot.  I'm annoyed now.  I blew up your pants.  We got him with Icy hot.  What the? 
[01:06:30]  What happened?  Oh.  I thought I fell five different slaps.  They just came out of nowhere.  Remember, it's Icy hot.  Don't put water on it.  No.  Last time.  Water and Icy hot.  Yeah.  Write it out, brother.  Water is the worst thing with Icy hot.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, no.  It's like an activator or something.  No, I just feel uncomfortable.  One more.  One more, and then we're done, I guess.  One more snack.  Oh, turn around and take a look at it first.  You're going to be worried about this kid.  Look how bad his ass is. 
[01:07:00]  I can't even hurt you.  He looks like a baboon.  You have a baboon ass.  Oh, boy.  What's that?  Yeah, there's something burning my ass.  There's something burning my ass that was not water.  I hope they're not really bad.  They're not dumping too bad down the hall, are they?  Why would they dump at all?  There's nothing to be dumped.  Everything's beeped.  They get a little panicky, you know. 
[01:07:30]  So many beeped.  That was not bad.  The other guy who works here is awful.  Ow.  Ow.  Yeah, I was looking at some of those examples.  Oh, that guy should be shot.  Ow's just well-muscled.  What do you say, Ow?  Ow just has a good body.  That was some interesting reading, but that's inside crap.  All right, here we go.  Finally, the last clip of Eastside.  Everything got through?  Yeah.  Thank you, Ow.  You need it, Danny.  Thanks, Ow.  Thanks for helping us out today.  All right, here we go.  Here's the last clip of Eastside Dave getting his man-on-man, bare bottom, icy hot, alcohol, 
[01:08:00]  water, spanking.  Spanking.  Oh, no, he's kicking his shirt off.  What are you looking at?  It's too hot, Danny.  It's way too hot, Danny.  Why are you naked?  It's too hot.  I'm f***ing dying.  Don't look.  F***ing poor men here.  We're not f***ing chicks.  Why are you naked?  A man with a bagel in his head.  I'm f***ing dying.  I'm f***ing dying.  It's here.  Oh, my God. 
[01:08:30]  F***ing holy.  Why is he naked, Ryan?  He does not have a stick on.  Where's the bagel?  The bagel shoved up his f***ing.  No, it's not funny, man.  No, f***ing.  Is he naked?  No, no, no.  No network.  Oh.  There you go.  I guess he heard somewhere that bread.  Bread will soak things up.  Will soak things up.  So he took a bagel. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Cut it in half.  Yeah.  And pretty much used himself like a toaster.  Yeah.  There you go.  We're distracted, though, because the news is doing what the news does best.  Yeah.  Nothing important.  They set up, what, a beach in Times Square because it's cold today and a little snowy in New York City?  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, just as a little side note, four GIs killed in Iraq yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah, but they set up Times Square like a beach.  And some of the guys are wearing T-shirts. 
[01:09:30]  And there's girls in a jacuzzi in bikinis.  They look miserable.  And there's a guy with an alligator standing there, a live alligator that I wish he would throw in that hot tub.  Of course they're not going to throw the alligator in the hot tub.  But they're teasing like it just might happen.  Well, you know they have hot, like a heat lamp there or something like that.  He's not just, this guy's standing in shorts and short-sleeved shirt.  No, that guy's wacky enough where he'll just stand there.  And how long is he there for?  In a Hawaiian-type shirt. 
[01:10:00]  How long is he there?  Come on, this is just too good.  Where's Paul when you need him?  Well, he's going to be there for another half hour or so.  Come on.  Hint, hint.  Nudge, nudge.  Oh, my God.  Hint, hint.  How great would it be?  They got a guy, and he's making believe he's walking on the moon.  He's in a space suit, a real space suit.  And he's doing slow-motion walk like he's got no gravity.  And then you go back to the anchor desk, and they're wearing a crown, a purple crown,  and a purple princess hat for the woman, and Mickey ears, and I want to open fire. 
[01:10:30]  I can't take the news.  It's not the news.  Mr. G is the weather guy, and he was wearing, like, sparkly Mickey Mouse ears,  and a sniper's bullet should remove that hat.  You know, he's like...  G stands for gay.  He's Mr. Gay.  But he's like an old salt.  He's been part of, like, the news in New York forever.  You know it's some dopey news director saying, look.  Here's what we got to do.  You either put the dumb crown on your head, or we're going to fire you. 
[01:11:00]  When did the local news become, like, wacky morning shows?  They're all, like, morning zoos.  Visual morning zoos.  When did that happen?  When they decided they had to do something flashy to get your attention,  because the other station was getting more ratings because their news was a little better.  When they realized they didn't have brains to talk about what's going on in Iraq.  So this is their distraction.  Like, look, we don't have the brain power to really present this to the people out there  and discuss it on a level. 
[01:11:30]  So we'll just make believe it's not happening, and we'll do just wacky things.  Yeah.  We'll distract you with wacky things.  They take quick breaks to actually give you the news.  The news part of it is like a short break.  Like what they used to do, they used to do those segments, those were the short breaks,  and the news was the news.  Now the news is the short little break, and the wackiness takes over the entire show.  It's a disgrace.  Yeah, I think it happened with A Current Affair.  To tell you the truth, I think that kind of started this, is it news? 
[01:12:00]  Is it entertainment?  I'm not sure.  They're talking about things that are in the news, but they're presenting it in this wacky,  like kind of tabloid fashion.  And then the news saw that that was a hit, so they incorporated it into their news,  and it kind of took over now.  So now the news is such a small part of the news.  But they shouldn't be allowed to use the word news anymore.  No.  They really shouldn't.  But it's not.  Cronkite just commented on that whole thing, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah, news is more entertainment now. 
[01:12:30]  But this isn't even entertaining.  It's just silly.  Yeah, that's exactly what he's talking about.  Well, they shouldn't get the carte blanche status that the news has enjoyed.  Yeah.  Whereas they can cover everything, and it's under the guise of news,  and it's like you're not doing your job.  Stuff like guys like, you know, the 7 o'clock news they used to have Jennings do.  Yeah.  That's, to me, real news.  Yeah, that's where they get on talking about news, have newsmakers on, interview them.  But this morning stuff is just ridiculous. 
[01:13:00]  But the local news here in New York, it looks like college kids are just kind of  throwing something together for them every morning.  Seriously.  Like it's a college, like, media thing going on.  You know what I mean?  Like just like a bunch of college kids.  They have to have something wacky every day.  Imagine what the meetings are like.  They have to sit there every day and say, what can we do tomorrow?  You know, what do we got lined up for the week as far as wackiness goes? 
[01:13:30]  We got to be out on some location.  We got to send this guy out.  And, you know, it's all got to be zany.  With no substance.  No entertaining.  No, because when a big news story happens, they sit there like idiots repeating the same thing over and over again.  Because they don't have a news division.  They don't have people that know how to do the news.  You know what I pray for every day?  Disaster.  Yeah, some horrific disaster happens.  And these local news teams have to report it with wacky hats on and stuff because they were doing something ridiculous. 
[01:14:00]  They were in the middle of doing something silly.  And they don't have time to take their clown makeup off.  Talk about some kind of a United States terrorist event dressed like Laurel and Hardy.  How awful would that be?  I pray for that every morning.  L.A. in flames.  Right.  And they just don't have time to remove their stupid costume for that morning's bitch.  That's a pie in the face talking about thousands dead. 
[01:14:30]  Just happen to get a...  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, my God.  We don't have time to clean up.  We got some horrific news to tell you.  Yeah, we'd like to tell you this horrific news.  We apologize that we are dressed like the judges from American Idol.  But thousands killed with fake boobs and stuff.  The fake boob chest.  Uh-huh.  They don't break characters.  Yeah, they don't have to...  They don't break characters.  Yeah.  Dog, let me tell you.  That was some terrorist event.  I thought it was awful.  I know we're in the middle of our Laurel and Hardy bit, but... 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Uh, ladies and gentlemen, this just coming in, thousands killed in Los Angeles.  Terrorist event.  It looks to be a small thermonuclear device was detonated.  Details are coming in.  Mm.  But did anyone get hit with a pie?  Um, look, I really don't think this is time to stay in character.  Perhaps you should...  I'm sorry, Ollie.  I'll come out of character and do the news. 
[01:15:30]  No, no, really.  I'm serious.  Thousands are dead.  Uh, as far as we know now, we're trying to get pictures.  Los Angeles is in flames.  Could you turn that goddamn music off?  Like one guy trying to have some dignity, just surrounded by clowns.  Right.  The big busted weather girl comes in.  Oh, no.  Could you get the slut out of here?  Thousands are dead.  Half-naked girls all over the place because they're doing their lingerie Valentine's Day. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  A bit.  Oh, we're going to have to stop, a break into your coverage.  We'd love to hear about what's happening in Los Angeles, but we do have a fashion show.  Oh, fashion show.  Their bodies in the streets.  We...  Half-naked bimbos on pills just wandering around the news set.  That's what's happening.  Your co-anchors in a clown suit.  You're dressed like Laurel and Hardy with your partner.  And you got into the news because you respected Walter Cronkite growing up. 
[01:16:30]  You realize halfway through you're still wearing that little Hitler mustache that that fat bastard was wearing.  You're licking your finger trying to wipe off the mustache.  You're going to wipe it off to convey the horrid news.  Naked Miles, where do I stand?  No, just get off the stage.  Get off the stage.  For the love of God.  We're not going to the fashion show.  We're going back to real news.  Oh, you can only...  You know, unfortunately it would take a horrible event, but you can only hope they get stuck in that situation.  You got some old...  When that does happen. 
[01:17:00]  You got some old broad that figured out how to use the hula hoop to get in shape.  And she's got her bimbo.  Come on, girls.  Next, we'll be getting into shape with old girl.  She's 80 years old and she's...  No, not today.  Cancel hula hoop.  An atomic bomb has been detonated on American style.  Doesn't anyone care?  He just shoots himself in the head halfway through the newscast.  You got stupid dog and...  Wow.  What happened to her?  It's just too much, man. 
[01:17:30]  Anyway.  We're doomed as a nation.  Doomed as a planet.  I want off.  But that's what they're doing today.  They set up a beach in Times Square as more of our GIs are dying.  Yeah.  Because they don't have a brain to discuss it.  They can't really figure out how to handle that situation.  Yeah.  So just put a party hat on.  Instead, why don't you have a little beach day in Times Square?  Because that's wacky.  Because it's the middle of winter.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  What are they doing in short-sleeved shirts? 
[01:18:00]  They're crazy.  It's the type of thing we did in junior high.  Yeah.  To be, like, cool.  Like, look what we're doing.  Look what we're doing.  We decided to come to school in our swimsuits.  And it's like a bad...  And during lunch period, we're going to make believe it's really warm out.  It's a bad Crazy Eddie bit.  Didn't Crazy Eddie used to do Christmas in July?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's Christmas in July.  Christmas sale.  We're practically giving it away.  He'd be dressed like Santa doing jingle bells and stuff.  Yeah.  Like, what the hell? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  His prices are insane.  And he's dressed like Santa and it's July.  And you'd be like...  You'd expect that from Crazy Eddie.  Because he's Crazy Eddie.  You'd also expect stock fraud.  Stupid Eddie Adner.  And...  But to see the news doing it is just...  Yeah.  There's no credibility.  When I was in camp, I was like 15 or 14, maybe 13 or 12.  A little tussleable gym.  We had...  It was over the summer.  We had like a Halloween party to make the season different.  But none of us had costumes. 
[01:19:00]  I remember I just tried to put my shoes on backwards and my clothes.  I went as backwards man.  No, you didn't.  I did.  No, you didn't.  I didn't hear that.  They're going to do that same bit tomorrow.  Oh, backwards man.  Backwards man.  Look.  Look.  Oh, hey.  Crazy.  Look.  Look.  Look.  I look like I'm in the middle of a hurricane.  Look.  I sprayed my hair all the way out to the side.  I know I'm dressed in backwards clothing and I apologize to that.  But Anthrax has been dumped in the city.  And we believe it's Oklahoma City. 
[01:19:30]  It's horrible.  He's slowly trying to turn his clothes back around the right way.  He's spinning around as he's taking a sleeve out.  Right.  The camera's just on his head.  Oh, boy.  Finally, I'm back to being a real news guy.  Your glasses are on the back of your head.  It's backwards man.  Sorry.  Someone is like.  Backwards man.  Jimmy.  Someone's like, yeah, Los Angeles is rocked with a 10.0 earthquake.  Like imagine, yeah, an earthquake hits your city or something, but they're in the middle 
[01:20:00]  of showing you all the wacky things you can get your wife or husband for Valentine's  Day.  And the anchors are are are connected by, you know, the fake handcuffs.  Yeah.  I'm wearing a ball and chain.  Give her the ball and chain.  What just happened?  They got a news desk filled with lubes and marital devices and hot broads in the background  in their lingerie.  And they have to report on an earthquake.  And this just in.  This is my dream. 
[01:20:30]  I think about this every day.  I'm not kidding you.  I want this to happen in the middle of one of these wacky things they're doing in the  in the morning and they just don't have time to clean it all up.  Catch them quite literally with their pants down.  But I do applaud Channel 11 here in New York.  They were showing camel toe like crazy yesterday.  We didn't even mention that on the show.  Because it's not news.  But it's not news, right?  Yes, we got it.  Yes, we understand that.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's break time.  Whoa, whoa.  It's break time.  Whoa, what?  Whoa, what?  It's party time.  What?  Notice how we moved right on from that gay crap, by the way. 
[01:21:00]  Hey.  Enough of that.  We leave that behind.  We're professionals, right?  We leave that in the past.  All right.  We're done with that.  It's the opening.  Now wait.  You got to promote Nicolas Cage at 830.  Oh.  Calling in.  Really?  Yes.  He's in a new movie.  What movie?  He's in that one where he plays that flaming biker.  Ghost Rider.  I don't mean it that way.  Ghost Rider.  Ghost Rider.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Steve's E-Story.  He'd be riding motorcycle.  We might actually have a real guest today. 
[01:21:30]  Maybe.  Hey, that's kind of cool.  Looking forward to it.  Also, we got to get to the Otto and George audio.  My God.  He killed on Letterman last night.  And then he's going to kill you.  Why?  Ugh, it's Letterman at the end of his set, Otto.  Yeah.  Don't get into it.  All right, we'll talk about it next.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:22:00]  We got Nicolas Cage calling in in a few minutes here.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots to do.  Jimmy's all over Diane Sawyer today.  I cannot take this old lady trying to be young and beautiful.  It's like you're an older woman.  She's wearing this awful, like, white, like a spandex almost shirt.  You just interviewed the president of Iran and Syria.  Have some dignity.  Yeah.  Dress like, wear a pantsuit like a lesbian.  What's the matter with you?  Well, they just showed the video of what they're doing in Times Square, another news station, 
[01:22:30]  and she thought it was all cute and funny, and she was really into it.  And we're sitting there going, you just interviewed the president of Iran.  Stay out of this.  The silly crap.  She has a mullet.  Diane Sawyer has a mullet.  What'd you say she was dressed as?  Oh, she's dressed like she's starring in Mom and Shantz.  Mom and Shantz.  She has that stupid, uh, the black and the white, and, you know.  That goes back quite a ways.  I know.  I'm an older gentleman.  It was like mimes with props.  Shields and Yarnell. 
[01:23:00]  Shields and Yarnell.  Was it Shields and Yarnell?  Yeah.  They were mimes.  Yeah, I love mimes.  They're walking into the woods.  Who doesn't?  Look at him.  He's in a box.  He can't get out.  Oh, he's in boxes.  Why?  Who is he playing tug of war with?  And I don't even see a rope.  Me either.  It's amazing.  It's Valentine's Day.  Look, he's giving her a rose.  Oh, look at him.  But the rose isn't in his hand, but it looks...  All right.  I'm looking at, um...  Pal Talk.  Pal Talk.  I see Map of Hawaii is there.  Wow, her camera's really moving around a lot. 
[01:23:30]  But, um, apparently tomorrow, her...  She's a very cute girl.  Her and her boyfriend will be, um, trying to claim sexy estate.  Ah, very nice.  Haven't done that in quite a while, and that's one thing that Pal Talk is really great for.  Yeah.  Uh, they will be on camera...  Tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow morning.  Yes.  And they will do what, uh, couples that are in love do.  Yes.  Um, and we're talking, you know, the whole deal.  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  Right there on the Pal Talk camera.  So we're going to be very distracted tomorrow.  Yeah, so we get to watch.  Your camera's a little blurry there, Map of Hawaii.  You gotta focus.  You gotta focus yourself.  You got a Diane Sawyer camera going.  It looks like she's, uh, resting up for the big fight.  Yeah, she's resting.  She's just...  She's in training.  She's not even in training anymore.  She's just relaxed and getting ready for the big, the big event tomorrow.  The big event.  She's just mellowing out this morning.  We love the Pal Talk cameras. 
[01:24:30]  And, uh, where are they from?  Are they from Hawaii?  Long Island.  They're from Long Island?  Long Island.  All right, so Long Island, New York.  Gonna try to, uh, reclaim, uh...  Sexy estate.  Sexy estate.  Tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's great.  All right, uh, the big story for a lot of people, and I think a lot of people can relate to this,  being stuck on a plane.  Oh, boy, that was a biggie on JetBlue yesterday out of New York.  We'll set it up with a quick news story.  They're frustrated.  They're uncomfortable.  Many are anxious and hungry, and they are literally trapped on JetBlue Flight 751, bound for Cancun, but going nowhere. 
[01:25:00]  Passengers took these photos during the eight hours they were literally trapped on the tarmac at New York's Kennedy Airport,  victims of the winter weather gripping the Northeast, and also victims of what JetBlue admits were unacceptable decisions.  I mean, it was just sitting there and sitting there, and they would say that they were going to pull us into the gate, and they never did.  They had, you know, there was very little food.  It was just a nightmare. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  A nightmare.  We got just a little more audio, then we'll get into this.  This trip from hell started just after 8 in the morning when the plane pulled back from the gate.  JetBlue flies to hell?  The airline says it was anticipating a break in the weather, but that never materialized.  So people on Flight 751 waited, and waited, and waited.  Hours went by with no movement and no information.  One passenger said it was like being held hostage.  Because nobody gave us any answers.  They kept telling us, we know as much as you do. 
[01:26:00]  And I said, I don't work here.  You work here.  Give me answers.  After more than eight hours, buses were finally brought in to take the passengers back to the terminal.  In a statement, JetBlue conceded it should have returned Flight 751 to a gate.  The airline is apologizing to the passengers and offering them a full refund as well as a free round-trip ticket.  How unbelievable is that?  Ain't that nice.  It's typical.  They admitted they should have returned to the gate. 
[01:26:30]  Isn't that like the first thing?  Hey, if the flight gets canceled, we can't take off in this.  Let's go back to...  Where do we go?  Where do these planes go?  Ah, just sit here until we figure it out.  I forgot.  Then they bus them back.  You know what the thing is?  I kind of always think, what if things?  What if this plane would have taken off and was destined to just crash and kill everybody on board?  And these people are so angry that they were bused to the terminal eight hours later, yet they don't know that they were actually saved. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, let me show you what was supposed to happen.  Here's what would have happened if you took off because your wings would have iced up.  You, uh, shortly after takeoff, your plane would have rolled over to the right, and, uh, with full tanks of fuel, you would have ditched it right into the water here off of Flushing, and, um, you'd have been dead, all of you.  But here's what happened.  You'd still get a guy, yeah, but eight hours. 
[01:27:30]  Love of God.  I understand what would have happened, but eight hours.  Come on.  Then there's the other what would have happened, which is them on the beach in Cancun sipping a margarita and laughing.  The more plausible what would have happened.  I don't get it, though.  I know all of us, it's happened to us where we've, uh, been stuck on a plane.  In my case, it was only an hour and a half, whatever.  Yeah.  We pulled up to a gate, and they couldn't get the, the whatever thing, what is it called?  The jetway.  The jetway to connect to the plane, so we had to sit there for an hour and a half.  And I'm sitting there going, there has to be a better way to get us off the plane, and it was a mechanical issue, and we had to just sit there for an hour and a half after flying, like, all day. 
[01:28:00]  I don't know why it takes, uh, airport, whether it's the plane maintenance or the maintenance of the jetways or anything, it takes them forever to fix anything.  Like, there are certain problems I understand probably take a long time, but whenever there's any problem at an airport, it takes forever.  Like, the jetway problem.  Just get someone out there and fix it.  And you're staring at the jetway. 
[01:28:30]  And how long does it take before someone even shows up?  Like, you're looking going, it's still broken, I see no one working on it.  Well, it always looks like it's someone right out of college.  And there are a lot of people looking at it.  A lot of people just kind of look at it.  Like, you see them looking, oh, here's the guy.  No, he's just a look at it guy.  But why?  I don't get why it's policy to keep everybody on the plane when it's obvious that this is going to be a really long.  I get if it's a half hour, hour delay.  Maybe, maybe an hour. 
[01:29:00]  But after that, why?  Get them off the plane.  What about smokers?  Dude, I smoked for 17 years.  I would have lit up in the air.  It's got to drive you crazy.  Ten hours, eight hours on a plane.  The nerve of the airline to keep you that long.  That is kidnapping.  I want to get off the plane.  Yeah.  I want to get off this plane right now.  You're not allowed.  What do I have to do to get off this plane?  Sir, you're making a disturbance, sir.  If you continue this disturbance, we will have to tell the authorities, and you will be arrested when you leave. 
[01:29:30]  I'm amazed no one was murdered.  Because you know the kids are screaming.  You know it's got to be hot as hell in there.  What were you telling me?  One woman went into the bathroom in hysterics, locked herself in for an hour, just crying, as the other bathroom just backed up.  What a poor, selfish.  I know.  Selfish.  She should have been smacked like that woman in the airplane.  And this plane was what?  I'll take over.  This plane was in line for takeoff when they decided to let it sit there?  They said that they were next in line. 
[01:30:00]  And it was pretty obvious that they were shutting down all flights yesterday for the most part.  So they had to turn around.  They had to turn around and go back to the terminal.  Yeah.  But by that time, their gate was taken.  You know, they don't just leave the gate open.  You leave, and now the plane's got to come in there, especially under those circumstances.  Yeah.  And they couldn't back any of the other planes out of the gates because those flights had been canceled, and they had nowhere to put the planes.  They were frozen.  And they were frozen.  Some of them are just frozen there.  They don't have enough vehicles for pushback.  They're frozen. 
[01:30:30]  So they just sat there, empty planes at the gates, and full planes out in the rotunda area of the terminal.  Outside, trying to find a place to put these people.  Just open the door, wheel up the old-fashioned wheels, the stairs, and get the people off.  And then, like, someone make a decision.  That seems to be the problem they have.  No one's there to make a decision.  All right.  They're stuck.  They're not going anywhere.  Get the frigging stairs. 
[01:31:00]  Get them off the planes.  Get them on buses.  Bring them back.  Or get one of those stuntman airbags.  Anything.  Because I know what they're going to say.  Well, they couldn't wheel that up to the plane because of the ice and the snow.  Plow it.  Figure it out.  So how did it end?  I think they finally got them back.  They got a gate that was open?  Yeah.  They called buses.  Oh, they bussed them.  That's right.  They didn't even bring the plane.  Why does that take 10 hours?  That's what they said.  They should have called them earlier.  And I'm guessing that they didn't want to spend the money.  I'm guessing that they knew it would cost them money to have airport buses come. 
[01:31:30]  And so being â€“ the airline industry is despicable.  They're despicable.  And I guarantee you they just didn't want to pay it.  That's it.  They probably didn't want to pay it.  So let the monkeys sit on the plane because, again, there's so many millions of people flying.  And they have no choice.  They don't care if you fly them or not.  What choice do you have when you're sitting on that plane, too, when, especially in this day and age, you can't make a fuss, you get up and you start yelling and screaming, there will be an FBI agent, and he will handcuff you, regardless of the situation. 
[01:32:00]  He will handcuff you.  You will be brought in and questioned and probably released but very inconvenient.  So you can't make a big to-do on the plane.  So you've got to sit there and just kind of take it.  You're at their mercy?  That's crazy.  And what, they were opening up the door every once in a while?  Yeah, they had to open up the door because it was blazing hot in there.  You just got a bunch of people, you know, they had, I guess, turned down, turned off the air conditioning.  Some of the people said there was just peanuts. 
[01:32:30]  They were handing out peanuts to them like circus animals.  And Terra Blue potato chips, the official snack of JetBlue.  Yes.  How do you have an official snack?  Well, at least you can watch TV.  And some people were outraged because they overheard the flight attendants talking about how much overtime they were going to make because of this.  Oh, really?  And laughing.  And didn't someone else suggest that they should hand out drinks to everybody?  Yeah, one guy was like, you know, they just had soft drinks.  They could have let us have some liquor.  And that idea probably wouldn't have been a good one. 
[01:33:00]  Imagine just on the ground 10 hours with drunk people having to deal with them.  It's like the flight attendants are going to go, you know, this can make the situation better.  Getting these angry people drunk.  Let's do that.  One of these days, an airline employee is going to get just drilled in the face on a plane because they are really arrogant, man.  They are the worst.  And I know you have to deal with the public who are pretty gross.  Yeah.  But I am easy to deal with.  And I've been dealing lately with Con and I hate airline employees. 
[01:33:30]  They're just they're not good people.  They used to be a lot more pleasant.  And I don't mean be pleasant to someone that's being obnoxious to you.  But I consider myself a pretty pleasant guy when I'm on a plane.  I have a Bloody Mary.  I'm smiling.  I'm feeling good.  That's all I really need.  And just a smile and a, you know, something.  But but they'd like they just throw things at you and the obnoxious old lady faces.  You know, they ought to they ought to instate that whole thing where there's an age limit on flight attendants because they just they're miserable. 
[01:34:00]  They've been doing it so long that they're they don't they're not happy in their jobs anymore.  Get some sexy young stews back in there.  Yeah.  Some eye candy.  Oh, yeah.  Little bit eye candy walking up and down the aisle.  That's what you need.  I don't want that.  No, no, I want I want black men who are well muscled and can handle anybody with a hyphen in their last name trying to get in the cockpit.  I don't want hot chicks.  I want hot men. 
[01:34:30]  I want hot chicks you could call toots.  Hey, toots.  I need my chips, toots.  What do you say, toots?  Nice set of stems on this one bringing me my drink.  Catch me some Terra Blues.  Nice cans.  Scotch and soda, dame.  The good old days.  Where you get to pinch.  Yeah, you pinch their ass as they walk by.  Oh, God.  Imagine doing that now.  Why was you be thrown off the plane?  Why was pinching ever acceptable?  I don't know.  Pinch that ass.  Hey, toots. 
[01:35:00]  And she would just turn around and go, tee hee.  Hey, hey, hey.  You got me.  I understand a little cup.  Like a grab cup.  Cup the cheek.  Or a little pat.  Right.  But the pinch.  The pinch.  A little pinch.  It gets an attention getter.  It's like, hey, baby.  You give her the pinch and she'd turn around and she'd put her hand over her mouth and go,  oh, you.  And continue along with her short skirt and her drink in her hand.  Her white-gloved Pan Am hand.  Yeah, Pan Am.  Jeez.  Her brown hat box luggage. 
[01:35:30]  Jimmy's all about the 1982 reference.  The pilot that she just had sex with in the hotel room.  Yeah.  Starting up the airplane.  James in Philly, what's up?  Ah, the good old days.  Yeah, what's going on, y'all?  Hey, man.  What's up, James?  Yeah, me and my girlfriend are going to Vegas.  And she left yesterday.  And, like, the plane was supposed to leave at, like, 7.  She called me at, like, 11.30, 12 and said she was still on the runway in the same spot.  So, you know, that happened a lot yesterday.  But when you think about it, do you really want them fixing your plane really quick? 
[01:36:00]  It wasn't even fixing.  They just were stuck on the runway.  They couldn't take off because of the horrible weather.  But after a certain amount of time, you've got to get these people off.  What are you thinking?  If it's something bad that really needs to be fixed on a plane, then I don't want to fly on the plane.  So I don't want them to fix it anyway.  Get me off of it.  And if it's something else, then it should be an easy fix.  And most of them are â€“ most mechanical problems on planes are easy, like, easy fixes.  They're fuses, bulbs, stuff like that. 
[01:36:30]  It's not like, oh, my God, we've got to replace an engine.  You know, just do it.  And it takes so long for the guy to even show up.  All right.  With that, we've got to take a break, a hard break.  We've got to break on time today because when we get back, we're talking to Nicolas Cage for two and a half minutes.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Ah, you're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:37:00]  Good morning.  Did we time this out perfectly or what?  Holy crap.  Did we?  Come back for break and we've got Nicolas Cage on the line, I do believe.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Never had perfect timing like that.  No.  Nicolas Cage?  Yes.  That is him.  Oh, wow.  There's the voice.  A real star, finally.  How are you doing, man?  Hello.  Hi there.  How are you?  There he is.  I'm good.  How are you doing?  I guess you're not impressed that we just called you a real star. 
[01:37:30]  We're starstruck and you're like, yeah, whatever.  Let's get this over.  I've got a hundred of these to do today.  I'm just a human being and I'm happy to talk to you.  How's it going?  Are you in L.A. right now?  No, I'm actually at the very moment in New York City.  Oh, that's where we're located.  Do you want to stop down?  I would if I could, but I've got three hours of this and you're number one.  Oh, my God.  Imagine three hours.  Did they put you somewhere comfy or are you sitting in like a folding chair?  I was just trying to find a good phone because all my phones had a bit of a buzz on them. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Why don't you give us your cell number and call us back?  We'll call you back.  And they gave me a cordless phone, which I'm shocked to say doesn't have a buzz, but originally they were going to put me in this tiny little corner in a room at the St. Regis Hotel, but I'm sitting on a couch talking to you on cordless.  Hey, I just read that you took Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  Well, I'm friends with Hoyce Gracie.  Oh, boy. 
[01:38:30]  He's a nice man.  He's a friend of my family.  And when I had time, I would train with him.  And I haven't done it in a little while, but we used to do it together about a year.  And he got me up to Blue Belt, which was pretty cool.  He did.  There were four belts.  Are you an expert in tapping out?  Because that's about all I'd know how to do.  I mean, I did tap out myself a few times.  Jesus, that guy's... 
[01:39:00]  But I haven't done it in a while, as I say.  I don't know if you remember me.  I saw you in Los Angeles.  You were walking into the Hyatt on Sunset with a bunch of people.  And I walked up with you, and I'm like, Nicholas, man, I'm a big fan.  And you look back, and you're like, oh, cool.  And then you kept going.  I was nice to you.  Yeah, you were nice.  I don't normally travel with a bunch of people.  Are you sure it was me?  Yeah, yeah, 100%.  But you guys were just walking in.  I mean, I don't know. 
[01:39:30]  You might have just been walking into the bar there or something.  It was just a few guys walking into the establishment.  Might have been three or four guys.  How many years ago?  I'm going to guess two years ago.  No, I don't believe that would be me then.  Because I haven't been out.  No?  He hasn't been out at all?  I haven't been out.  I mean, I haven't been out for at least, I'm going to say, 15 years.  Somebody else.  You may be mistaken, but, you know, anyway.  No one really realizes how many movies you make. 
[01:40:00]  I was looking at IMDb, and you make, like, a lot of movies a year.  Jesus, in 2008.  Well, I mean, I've seen movies and I act in movies, and I do maybe an animated voice or  one line here or there, but it's misleading to think that I star in as many movies as you  might think a year.  Is that it?  Yeah, okay.  I do maybe two movies a year.  Like your appearance in Fast Times at Ridgemont High kind of appearance?  Yeah, well, that was a long time.  I know. 
[01:40:30]  It was cut out of that movie.  No, but the TV version.  It wasn't good enough for them at that time.  But the TV version, Nicholas, you're all over.  Oh, okay.  But the TV version of that movie, ugh.  When they cut out all the, you know, parts that were good.  All the drug references and all that.  Did they extend my part in the TV version?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, they give you a few more lines in it.  I'm a big fan of Valley Girl myself, but I'm sure you don't want to talk about that either.  We should talk about the new movie, Ghost Rider.  Yeah, Nicolas Cage is like one of those guys that has, you've had kind of like two careers. 
[01:41:00]  You kind of like, you were almost a child actor.  You know, you're a young guy early on.  Yeah, I started when I was 17.  Yeah.  So, and then, you know, throughout the years, you kept a pretty good career going.  Thank you.  Yeah.  How stupid is Fast Times from Ridgemont High that the one guy they cut out is an Oscar winner?  A bunch of dopes.  Well, you know, that was, I auditioned for Judge Reinhold's part about, seems like about eight times. 
[01:41:30]  And I kept getting close, but they didn't want to pull the trigger.  So they gave me the part of Brad's bud number one.  Yeah.  Bud number one.  Yeah.  That's who I was.  But, you know, it just seems like it's another lifetime ago.  Yeah.  All that stuff is ancient, man.  When you won for leaving Las Vegas, who, I don't remember who you were up against that year.  I mean, did you like expect to win or were you up against somebody that you're like, there's no way I'm beating this guy? 
[01:42:00]  I had no expectations.  I mean, it really is.  It's such a different experience.  I mean, you don't know really what's going on.  It's quite terrifying and it's exhilarating and all those things.  But you never really know.  I mean, you never feel like it's in the bag, if that's what you mean.  Yeah.  Where is that Oscar right now?  You know, I have a screening facility in my home, which is where I watch my movies and do my research and think about characters. 
[01:42:30]  And so that's where I put all my movie paraphernalia.  I have old movie posters and things like that.  And that's where I put it.  You know, I loved it.  I'm just thinking of this.  What was the one where you played the guy who got conned, the con man?  What was that?  Matchstick Man.  Matchstick Man.  Oh, man, was that good?  Thank you.  Yeah, I really liked that movie.  It's sort of a movie that has yet to be discovered. 
[01:43:00]  It was Ridley Scott who directed that.  And I played a character that was afflicted with Tourette's syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder, but was also a con artist.  It was a pretty interesting movie for me.  Yeah, I really liked it.  Now you got Ghost Rider.  It's coming out, right?  Yeah, it's coming out tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Comic book, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is this your first comic book character? 
[01:43:30]  It's my first comic book genre film, and I'm very excited about it.  What's the gist of this guy?  Well, it's Faust meets Evel Knievel meets a western meets a biker film meets Beauty and the Beast meets a werewolf movie.  It's all my things that I'm interested in.  Wow, man.  And Peter Fond is in it.  Oh, yeah.  No, you haven't seen Peter turn up in anything in a while.  Well, if you're going to have someone play Mephistopheles and try to get a stunt cyclist to seduce or to seduce a stunt cyclist into selling his soul, who better than, you know, Easy Rider himself? 
[01:44:00]  How is he just a person to work with?  Is he as odd as he comes off?  Well, he has, you know, he has many stories to tell you.  And you either want to listen or you don't.  In my case, I enjoyed listening to him.  Some people apparently don't.  That's a nice way of saying Peter Fonda babbles. 
[01:44:30]  Peter Fonda what?  He babbles.  He just talks a lot.  If I were you, I would.  You should have done him when you talked to him.  You should have only talked about Yuli's gold and asked him if he got stung by bees.  You should have just.  But, you know, if you ask about Easy Rider, he can, he can recall verbatim his monologues or his dialogue and then start reenacting scenes.  Like, we didn't ask you to, but thanks.  Thanks anyway.  You got a, you got a great like resume and like obviously a member of the Coppola family.  So, I mean, you've kind of been around like really gifted people. 
[01:45:00]  Is there anybody you ever did a scene with that you were intimidated by?  Like, I can't believe I'm actually in a scene with this person.  You know, I, I, I, nothing comes to mind, but I mean, I can't, I can't imagine that hasn't happened.  But I, at the moment, as I speak to you now, today, I'm not, nobody's coming to mind.  You got Grindhouse also.  You're in that?  That's Tarantino and Rodriguez's project?  Look, guys, I'm barely in that thing. 
[01:45:30]  I did that for no money.  I did it as a favor to Rob Zombie, who's a friend of mine.  I just, I'm like two lines.  I played Fu Manchu in a phony trailer for a movie that doesn't exist.  Get out of here, really?  That's it?  I mean, it's, it's real, it's real goofball stuff.  I like how you sell that one.  That's good.  You're all right, man.  I like, I like Nicholas King.  I like Nicholas.  Well, Nicholas, obviously, best, best of luck on the movie, Ghost Rider. 
[01:46:00]  And I'm sure you're, you're going to have a pleasure doing another three hours of these.  When are you going to, when are you going to hate doing these interviews?  Do you hate it already?  That's a strong word, man.  When do you realize this really stinks?  We try to keep it, we try to keep it pretty honest here, Nick.  You sound like someone who doesn't enjoy your company.  Well, yeah, it's one of those things, though.  Could you imagine just calling someone at random and trying to carry on a conversation with them? 
[01:46:30]  It is the oddest thing, you know?  It's weird, but, but I'm not going to say I hate it.  Like, we would never hang out unless, like, we, you know, this is the only way we would ever hang out.  I'd love to hang out with a Nicholas K.  We'd have to, but this is it.  We'd have to win a contest to hang out with him.  Yeah.  Some kind of a contest.  And he'd be all annoyed that he's got to be there.  Right.  We almost, according to one of you two, we almost hung out at the Sunset High. 
[01:47:00]  Yes.  Hey, Jimmy almost.  How homoerotic I was following you into the hotel.  What a creep I am.  Yeah.  No argument there.  That is quite funny, now that you put it like that.  Sometimes you get starstruck, you just don't realize, like, I'm actually, I'm following another man.  It's just kind of like, why don't I leave the guy alone?  He's busy.  Well, but no, but actually, you know, there is a kind of a relationship that anyone who goes to the movies has with an actor,  more so almost than with a rock and, like, a musician, because in a way, I mean, you do know me. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, if you've seen my movies in some way, it's true.  You know some part of me well.  So I can't assume to think that you don't know me.  I mean, I'm speaking generally now of anybody who's seen me in a movie.  I have put my soul into my movie, and I've presented some aspect of myself, so it is fair for that person to think they have rights to me or they know me in some way.  Well, that's the problem, though, Nicholas. 
[01:48:00]  We're really mad that you're not saying hi to us because we're like, look, look.  I know him.  Why doesn't he know me?  I did say hi to you, although I'm still saying there's a 50-50 chance it never happened.  There was a doppelganger who looked like me who was pretending to be me.  You know, that's happened to me.  How awful.  He's probably ripping people off all over Los Angeles, and they think it's you.  No, Jimmy, I think that was an invite.  Costas say they're me and do all kinds of horrible things.  How can someone say they're you?  All right.  People know what you look like, for God's sake. 
[01:48:30]  Well, it's happened.  Trust me.  Wow.  He's got about 300 more of these to do.  All right.  Nick, I'll call you Nick.  Okay.  That's good.  So if I see you, I'll just go, hey, Nick.  Ghost Rider out tomorrow, man.  Good luck with it, and we're really glad you called in.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Good talking to you, man.  Have fun today, Nick.  Later.  Nicholas Cage, everyone.  It was cool.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, man.  Oh, get me out of here.  Thank God that's over with.  That was so funny.  It sounded like some guy that was doing a Nicholas Cage impression. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  He could actually wrap it up in about 15 minutes with a few of those.  If he would have talked dirty to me, I would have allowed it.  That voice.  It's so recognizable as Nicholas Cage.  Now, everyone look at Roland and go, thank you, Roland.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  A real guest on our show for once.  Although he's in New York.  Could have stopped by.  Oh, yeah.  Well.  I will never be satisfied.  Ghost Rider tomorrow.  All right.  Bitches.  Hey, let's do the Otto and George before we move over. 
[01:49:30]  Otto and George.  I'm so happy.  Otto did well, man.  Otto.  He did really well.  Otto is a friend of the show.  He did our O&A Traveling Virus this past summer.  He'll hopefully be on the one we're doing this summer.  And we're so happy that he finally got a big spot like David Letterman.  And he was himself, man.  It was obviously this language and stuff he couldn't do.  I'm sorry.  Is somebody, a couple of people, or at least one, wait a minute, are saying, did he say  awful when he hung up the phone? 
[01:50:00]  He goes, I could swear he said awful as he hung up the phone.  No, I don't think so.  Can we replay it?  We'd have to hear that again.  I would love if he said awful.  Oh, that would be very hurtful.  Let's get that back.  Enhance it.  It's an electronic movie FBI sound enhancing so we can hear him say awful.  All right.  Let's do the Otto and George here.  So he was on Letterman last night.  We got some highlights.  Yeah.  We're very proud of Otto today. 
[01:50:30]  We're very happy for him.  Yeah.  Very happy for him.  We think he's one of the funniest guys out there.  He just doesn't get the attention other people get for whatever reason.  We don't get it.  Maybe because he's self-destructive all the time.  Otto's a psychopath.  But he looked good, man.  He looked comfortable.  He looked relaxed.  He was ready.  I mean, it was good to see him.  I was always happy to see your friends.  You kind of want to see your friends bomb, too, because it's fun.  It's fun to goof on.  Yeah, he did great.  I feel bad for him.  All right.  Here we go.  Otto and his puppet George on David Letterman last night.  You may want to put the kids to bed for our guest tonight because he is the most controversial 
[01:51:00]  ventriloquist working today.  Controversial.  You don't often think of ventriloquism and controversy.  No.  We have it for you tonight.  He has a new CD entitled Classic Moments.  I'm sorry.  It's a DVD.  Not a CD.  It's a DVD.  Entitled Classic Moments.  Please welcome Otto and George.  Thank you.  It's great to be here.  Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.  I just hope to God you don't curse. 
[01:51:30]  No, I'm not going to curse.  Happy Valentine's Day.  And look, I got a big heart on.  Would you like to touch it?  No, no, no.  Thanks.  Just take this off here.  Stupid red heart on him.  Of course.  On George the Puppet.  Yeah, big, huge heart for Valentine's Day.  You look good.  Nice shirt.  I didn't know Ted Bundy had a catalog.  God.  So what do you got planned for Valentine's Day? 
[01:52:00]  Well, me and my girlfriend like to eat, you know.  So I'm going to take her to a nice restaurant for a romantic candlelit dinner, followed by  a smooth elevator ride up to the room, and then I'm going to watch the Letterman show.  Well, of course.  Yeah.  And if she talks when it's on, I'm going to crack her skull open with an ashtray.  That sounds real romantic.  Just don't curse.  Yeah, I can't curse, but Entertainment Tonight can show Britney Spears Velcro when she's getting 
[01:52:30]  out of the car with no underwear on.  Britney Spears Velcro.  Yeah, Otto was obsessed with the fact that he couldn't curse on Letterman.  Yeah.  But a damn good job.  Man, that is really funny.  Considering what his act is.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  I can't believe we're here at the Ed Sullivan Theater.  This is just amazing.  The history here, you know.  Elvis Presley, Jim Morrison.  Yeah, both dead.  Speaking of dead, are they storing the bodies in here? 
[01:53:00]  I'm freezing.  It's freezing in here.  It's cold outside.  This gig sucks.  All right.  Oh, my God.  The Statue of Liberty has the torch under her dress.  All right.  He is killing, killing on regular TV.  He's storing the body.  He's on Letterman, because the Letterman studio is notoriously freezing.  Yeah.  He's on Letterman.  This gig sucks.  This gig sucks. 
[01:53:30]  They kill it this week, Jim.  You know they're mocking our profession?  Yeah, Letterman over there.  The skinny guy.  Looks like Audrey Hepburn.  No, he looks good.  He should eat something.  You can afford it.  Have a gyro, pal.  He looks like he should be a bouncer at a salad bar.  All right.  Let's see.  By the way, I like you in Cabin Boy.  That was your best work since Lork and Mindy.  It's like De Niro without the talent. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  Come on.  Paul Schaefer.  Yeah, he looks good.  You bother call.  The turtle waxes in.  All right.  Does your head slide off the pillow at night?  He's like Letterman's puppet.  Who's working your head?  All right.  Oh, man.  That takes balls.  I've never seen anybody even comedically go after him like that. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, he looks like Audrey Hepburn.  You want more or what?  You want more?  Of course.  Oh, he's crazy.  Hey, George.  Have you ever had anybody really famous in your taxi?  Yeah, I had former governor of New York, Pataki, in the cab.  What kind of name is Pataki?  It sounds like something you stepped in on the way to the car, you know?  Hey, that's Pataki.  Walk around it.  Mommy, I made a Pataki. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Who else have you had?  I had McGreevy, the governor of New Jersey.  I made him right up front.  He ain't sitting behind me.  Leave him alone.  It's an alternative lifestyle.  Yeah, right.  Being Amish is an alternative lifestyle.  All right.  Did he have his Brokeback Mountain joke?  He had a funny Brokeback Mountain joke. 
[01:55:30]  Maybe it's right here.  Yes, Jameson, yes.  What did the black lesbian say to the white lesbian?  You're the man.  All right.  Hey, George, did you see Brokeback Mountain?  Yeah.  What did you think?  Loved him, hated him.  All right.  You know the original title of that was A Fish Full of Testicles?  All right.  No way.  We've got to hurry up.  We've got four minutes and they're throwing us out of here.  Try getting in this building tomorrow, Geppetto. 
[01:56:00]  All right.  Geppetto.  Wow.  Man, he did a good job.  George, do you like plane travel?  Oh, man, it sucks.  Every time I get in an airplane, I'm never sitting next to a cute girl.  I'm always sitting next to some old guy who wants to talk, you know?  Where you from?  Where you going?  Where am I going?  Look at your ticket.  That's where we're all going. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, man.  Might as well finish it up here.  Yeah, sure.  I'd like to sing a song for Valentine's Day.  This is a love song from the movie Jaws.  Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to.  Good crowd, right?  Yeah, and Sonny Bono's a good skier.  I love Jaws.  Jaws was a great movie. 
[01:57:00]  Remember the opening scene in Jaws?  This drunk girl goes swimming naked.  I'm drunk.  Come on in the water.  Come on in.  And then you hear.  Come on in.  What is it?  Doesn't this broad hear the music?  Get out of the water.  It's short music.  All right.  All right.  Hey, is anybody here from New Jersey?  New Jersey? 
[01:57:30]  Kill yourself.  What a polluted dump New Jersey is now.  New Jersey, where our fart is refreshing.  King.  Seriously.  Here's a poem I wrote about Jersey.  It's called Pollution.  It's a poem.  Go ahead.  I shot an arrow into the air.  It's stuck.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hello. 
[01:58:00]  It's George.  Ladies and gentlemen, Dave.  Thank you very much.  Nice to have you with us.  Did you hear him?  Ugh, George.  Ugh.  Let him.  Ugh.  He went, thank you, Dave.  And George is looking right at him and went, ugh.  Ugh.  He ugh to Letterman.  Otto killed on Letterman last night.  Otto and George on Letterman last night.  Otto.  Yeah.  Oh, he's on.  Otto.  Otto.  Wow.  Bang up job, my friend.  What's going on?  Dude, you had to be thrilled with that.  Yeah, that went really well.  Yeah, yeah.  It's good. 
[01:58:30]  I have less blood in my stool this morning than I did to take it for.  What's happening?  Uh, did he, uh, he seemed to enjoy you.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, he was very brave of you to smash Letterman and then smash Paul Schaefer.  Oh, is that funny?  Oh, thanks, man.  Um, I was actually, uh, I thought, uh, um, I was going to close with the, uh, Kennedy bit  and then they made me change it to George Bush trying to figure out the war in Iraq and  I did it in rehearsal, you know, and the brain explodes. 
[01:59:00]  Then they said, uh, it looks too much like a bullet.  Uh, you have to cut back because the Secret Service is going to get in touch.  They said some, I forgot the name of the group, some big rock group wore a t-shirt where it  looked like Bush was getting shot and they said the Secret Service came right, right to  their next concert and, and like, uh, you know, told them, uh, you know, what's your  problem with the president and stuff?  Oh, man.  Yeah, there were a lot of last minute cuts and then they told me I did seven minutes.  I was supposed to do four and a half. 
[01:59:30]  So you did seven minutes.  We're going to make some trims, but I think they were lying.  I think, I think I was, uh, uh, right on, on the time, but I think they still had a problem  with the content and stuff.  What would they take out?  Um, that last bit about Jersey, they, that was chopped right in half.  I, something about a broccoli fart.  I don't know.  I literally just woke up here.  I'm very thirsty, but I'm not going near the mini bar because I'm still an underpaid  road act here.  I'm going to have a $40 fresca. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, you were in a hotel in New York?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm, um, right across the street from you at the Parker Park Meridian.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  They have a lovely breakfast downstairs.  Yes, they do.  Oh, they have a fabulous brunch.  Well, if you get up, uh, join us over at XM today, Adam.  Get room service and then just watch movies.  It's fun.  Yeah.  A $1,200 breakfast.  Yeah.  $1,200.  So you thought I did good?  Oh, no.  You killed.  You killed, man.  I mean, the feedback, we just played the whole set for the most part. 
[02:00:30]  And the feedback is really, really good.  I think, I say, yeah, you get something big from this.  I say Letterman makes you a regular or something.  Because you killed and you're different.  And it was, it was great.  Really?  Yes.  You let steal.  You let steal.  Oh, God.  Otto, you should be really proud today, man.  I'm telling you, that was unbelievable.  It was a great spot.  Thanks.  You guys are great.  I really appreciate your kind support.  Well, it was, uh, it was cool to watch, man. 
[02:01:00]  Because, I mean, I've seen you for so many years.  It was just kind of cool.  You're just being yourself.  There's nothing, you know, just certain stuff that you didn't do for content reasons.  But it was great.  It wasn't, you didn't change anything.  Yeah.  I'm not a whore and a sellout.  No, no, no, not at all.  Are you kidding me?  The set was about six minutes on TV.  I'm getting a note here.  Yeah?  Yeah, so they gave you a little more than the four and a half.  Absolutely.  So that's pretty cool.  Wow.  And Jimmy pointed out, and it's been making us laugh all morning, because we're playing  it during the breaks and stuff.  We hear you going, ugh, to Letterman at the end of the set. 
[02:01:30]  Or actually, George did.  Wink, wink.  Well, the thing that was funny, I watched it with my girlfriend, and he walks over with  his hand out, and you're looking away, and I'm like, dumb Otto doesn't even see Letterman's  trying to shake his hand.  And it was such a moment I've had with you 400 times in clubs.  And then the puppet just looks at him and goes, ugh.  You know what?  My girlfriend Trish told me to do that.  She goes, when Letterman walks up, make sure George goes, ugh, because he always does  that, you know?  Yeah.  So I've got to credit my girlfriend on that. 
[02:02:00]  Hey, did you get to meet Letterman before or after?  No, no.  He's like a ghost, man.  He literally shows up four seconds before they tape.  Isn't that the weirdest thing?  He walks around the stage with his, you know, just the whole thing is very weird.  You know, that guy Biff is, like, sits in for him and does a rehearsal.  Yeah.  That little black dude.  Yeah.  And, no, not really.  I didn't, the only contact I had when he was, when he came up behind me like a creepy 
[02:02:30]  ghost and tried to shake my hand.  Creepy ghost.  Make him believe there's an actual connection between him and the people he has on his show.  Yeah.  And then the lights go off and they hustle you out and you're not even allowed to look  at him in the eye.  He vamooses.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, a little strange.  Dude, Audrey Hepburn, I really laughed.  That was great.  Oh, yeah.  Just to smash him like that was really ballsy.  Well, Otto, congratulations, buddy.  Otto.  Otto?  I thought he fell asleep.  Come over to XM if you can, man. 
[02:03:00]  If you're up and you want to come over to XM, come hang and we'll have a nice breakfast  and we'll all laugh.  Okay.  All right, buddy.  What time do you go over there?  Now?  Now for two more hours.  Now we'll be over there until about 11.  It's up to you.  If you want to stop by, we'd love to see you.  See you, Otto.  Thanks, boys.  All right.  All right, Otto.  Otto and George on Letterman last night.  Just killing.  Thank you.  All right, buddy.  All right.  And we couldn't be happier for him.  Yeah.  I won't be seeing all these free FMers tomorrow.  What?  What happened?  Tomorrow.  I'll be in Lancaster at the Italian Villa performing. 
[02:03:30]  So see you on Monday.  Lancaster.  In Amish country there?  Yeah, the Amish.  Yeah.  All right.  I have to go have a chat.  What?  I have a quick meeting.  Who?  I'm a Nelly.  What about me?  Am I going with you?  I'm going to get yelled at.  For what?  Am I going with you?  It's on my ass.  For what?  Oh, no.  They're splitting us up.  I knew this day would happen.  Divide and conquer.  Oh, well.  I'm going to get my own show here.  That's all right.  That's great.  That's going to be good.  I'm done with this crap anyway.  I'm going to call myself Nick DiPaolo. 
[02:04:00]  Hey, guys.  If you're not joining us over at XM, go after yourselves.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony XM 202.  We'll see you next time. 
[02:04:30]  Thank you. 
[02:05:00]  Thank you. 
[02:05:30]  Thank you. 
[02:06:00]  Thank you. 
[02:06:30]  Thank you. 
[02:07:00]  Thank you. 
[02:07:30]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:08:00]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of town hall PM.  Opie, you know, I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:08:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Right to the instant feedback.  Right to it.  Ah, Bird and Philly.  Who's this rock version of Ecstasy of Gold by?  I didn't catch the explanation yesterday.  That's Metallica.  Metallica.  It's off an album dedicated to the songs of that dude that does Ecstasy of Gold. 
[02:09:00]  Is it all Metallica doing it or did they just do that one?  Just that one.  And then other bands do other songs that guy did.  I always forget his name.  But he did all the cool, you know, guitar shit for all those spaghetti westerns.  It was great.  Mostly the Clint Eastwood movies.  Thanks for using this version of the song.  I haven't heard the whole thing yet.  Maybe this is a sign of better things to come from Metallica.  That's Dan from Raleigh.  Jimmy from Newark.  Metallica version sucks.  They fail to capture what makes the song so cool.  Hmm.  I agree with Jimmy.  I don't like it. 
[02:09:30]  I think it sucks.  It's all right.  I decide I don't like it.  Yeah, I don't think it sucks.  I've heard it three or four times now.  I'm like, I just said the same thing.  Like, you could do so much more with the guitar with that song.  He's just shredding.  And we all know he could shred.  He could shred his little balls off.  Yeah, but...  Meow, meow.  Yeah, more should be done to keep it true to the song, man.  And then someone else, holy shit, I got chills.  Where can I get it?  So, you know, most people are liking it.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  It's a totally different... 
[02:10:00]  It's a totally different song.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  The one version is the whole orchestra and everything.  And then that.  It's a bunch of guys rocking.  The original, though, is just so dramatic.  Oh, yeah.  And the build.  It just builds nicely.  They didn't capture the whole building of the song.  No.  It's just like a little bit in the beginning and then...  Rock!  Rock!  What a rock!  All right.  We got lots to do today.  We got a lot of cleaning up to do.  We got some great stuff in front of us. 
[02:10:30]  Cleaning?  Yeah.  We like to clean everyone.  Look at all this crap in front of us.  I'm not using the Windex.  No?  I'm not sweeping either.  And we got Ralph May outside the studio.  Looking miserable.  Is he on heroin?  Are you on heroin?  Heroin.  No?  All right.  Mad Magazine is funny, man.  Why?  What's up?  Just they have the Dane on the cover, and he's doing that Su-Fi superfinger, and Alfred  E. Newman is doing...  He's got both Su-Fi fingers jammed up his nostril.  It's just a funny fucking magazine.  That's pretty cool making the cover.  Dude, how famous is this guy? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  He's pretty famous.  I was in one snippet of Mad Magazine, Chris Rock was on the cover, it was about comedy,  and then they smashed Tough Crowd, and there's like a caricature of Colin, and then there's  me, dumb Patrice, and DiPaolo.  Really?  I'll be saying something stupid.  Yeah, I'm so happy that I got it.  Yeah.  Our Wow sticker made one of their cartoons.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think it was on the moon or something, or on a spaceship.  I can't remember exactly now.  Yeah.  I'm going to be in Mad Magazine.  Should we make Ralphie wait?  W-E-I-G. 
[02:11:30]  Making the audience wait while you eat.  Enjoy your yogurt, you're the boss.  No, that's, uh, what do you have?  Cereal.  Cereal, right?  Yeah, man.  My blood sugar is bad today.  Cereal.  How funny was fucking Ron yesterday from Ron and Fez?  He was great.  Ron, he's amazing.  Bastard is really funny.  I'm Bennington.  He was great.  That's Ron and Fez.  Well, that's where we should start, where we left off.  We were in the middle of Tyson Audio, which was funny as hell.  Oh, yeah.  And then Ronnie came in with Fezzy, and all hell broke loose, and we were happy that happened.  Definitely.  Yep.  The videos, by the way, are up on opandanthony.com. 
[02:12:00]  I like that guy, Dave.  I never knew what he did, because I don't listen to, you know, a lot of the show.  I catch moments of it.  Dave's having a mind.  He really is a fucking mental case.  Yeah.  I thought I hated him.  Oh, I like him.  I never really met him or anything.  I thought I hated him, and I like the guy.  Well, that's what happens.  You hate him at first.  Is that what happens?  Yeah.  You absolutely hate him.  Because I hear little things here and there, and I'm like, man, I don't like this guy,  but I like him.  Without a doubt, I like the guy.  Then you realize he's kind of funny.  When's the big Ron and Fez party?  The 24th.  What day of the week is that? 
[02:12:30]  Somebody quickly.  Friday.  I'm busy.  Oh, that's the 23rd, then.  Yes.  23rd.  Okay.  Yeah, I can't go either.  I'm so bummed.  Why?  I'm going to...  Where are you going?  I'm going...  Opie, where are you going?  Oh, he's going...  Opie.  Opie.  You're going...  Opie.  That's not important.  All right, forget it.  Oh, I don't know.  Should I tell everybody?  What do you think?  I would.  Just stand there at a party. 
[02:13:00]  I'm going away for the weekend.  I don't want to go to a party.  I get shy at parties.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a wallflower.  Oh, you just sit there in your chair waiting for someone to ask you to dance?  No, I stand there with a punch in my hand, and I just kind of nod a little bit like  I mean to be alone.  Like I want to be by myself.  Hey, hi.  How you doing?  By awkward.  Joey from Boston.  You're going to throw your head up to people.  Opie, it's...  See, I can't...  The name's right there.  Yes.  And I can't say it.  Okay?  I can't say it.  Why?  Ennio.  Ennio. 
[02:13:30]  How do you spell it?  E-N-N-I-O.  Ennio.  E-N-N-I-O.  Ennio.  Yeah, I think that's Ennio.  What?  Ennio.  Ennio?  I think it's Ennio.  Ennio.  It's Pete.  All right, got that out of the way.  And then his last name is Morricone.  Morricone.  Morricone, yeah.  Whatever.  Morricone.  Look, man, this is America.  We don't have to pronounce it.  Exactly.  What is this?  How about Steve or Dave Johnson?  Right.  That's what we're calling you.  Come on in, Ralphie, you miserable fuck. 
[02:14:00]  Is he a miserable lie?  I don't know.  He's just sitting there.  Did you just wake up?  Look at that traffic.  Maybe it's because we've been up since four.  That's it, man.  Here, sit over there.  Sit over there.  Okay.  You make everyone uncomfortable.  I don't know when you sit over there.  Why?  I didn't know that.  That's a joke, Ralph.  It's too sweet.  Oh, you got coffee?  Yeah.  I got coffee done, Steve.  It's fantastic.  What jersey is that?  This is Joe Namath.  When he played for?  Alabama.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow. 
[02:14:30]  All right.  I knew that was an old Rams jersey or something.  I'm trying to figure it out.  Jeez.  That's pretty cool.  Joe Namath fan?  Big time.  Big time.  Bigger fan after, was a year and a half ago when he was drunk at 9 a.m. and heading  on the news reporter.  Yeah.  I'm all of his last.  I'm all of his.  Fantastic.  I love you.  I want to kiss you.  Awesome.  He was tanked.  Awesome.  He was so lit.  You always over-modulate when you're here.  I don't know.  Yeah, back up a little bit. 
[02:15:00]  Just a little.  All right.  There you go.  Yeah, we just had Joe Namath on the phone about a month ago.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Pretty cool.  We said, why would you go after Pam Oliver?  She's like the dykeiest brought out there.  Out of all the hot sideline reports you go after, you're going to her?  What did he say?  He was just laughing and he wanted to hang up.  No, he wanted no part of it.  We're supposed to get signed books.  We never got them.  The whole thing was a mess.  That's right. 
[02:15:30]  I don't want to get into it.  That's right.  Joe Namath is a lying sack of shit.  Where's our signed book?  Yeah, I learned to play the game.  Okay, good.  Stupid accent.  How about a signed book that I can sell when your fucking alcoholism one day drives you  into a fucking guardrail?  I like to play and wear shitty cologne.  I play the game hot.  Yeah, I know.  Joe, we get it.  We get it.  You fucking toothy horse's ass.  How about a signed book?  He really enjoyed the call.  Yeah.  He remembered it.  Man, just hearing the audio of Otto and George on David Letterman. 
[02:16:00]  Phenomenal.  Isn't that great?  Yeah, we like that.  Guy did a great job.  Very happy.  Bang up.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Those shows are so hard to do.  Those shows are so hard to do.  Especially for someone like Otto.  Yeah.  You go to see his act.  And, you know, that puppet doesn't have much self-control.  That's all my language.  But to be able to do that, yeah.  We got Ned Nitpicky checking in.  Ned Nitpicky?  It's Susie Cobbler. 
[02:16:30]  Cobbler?  Cobbler.  What?  I think it's a Cobbler.  I don't know.  Whatever.  It wasn't Pam Oliver.  Thank you, Tate.  Who was it?  From FBA.com.  It was Susie Cobbler.  K-O-B-L-E-R.  Cobbler.  Same thing.  Susie, who gives a shit.  Who gives a flying fuck.  The twat that Joe Namath is trying to fuck.  Right.  There you go.  Ice queen.  And cock blocker.  Let's go to Glenn in Boston.  What's up, Glenn?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  I remember back in the day, you were on AAF. 
[02:17:00]  First time I ever listened to you.  Anthony did Tyson.  I pissed my pants laughing.  Oh.  That's Tyson I ever heard.  I'd love to hear it today.  I got one of those kumia hangover right now that he would absolutely cure right now if he did some Tyson.  Oh.  Well, you'll be vomiting then if you have one of my hangovers.  Jerk on, bike it in, and it goes away.  A jerk off and two Vicodins?  Hangover's gone.  You know what?  A good jerk does help a hangover. 
[02:17:30]  No, I understand.  A good jerk does help a hangover for some reason.  It opens up the blood vessels.  But it was one of those situations where I was stuck having to sit and talk.  Like, you know, because I was on the radio.  Yeah.  I was so hungover last week.  I think it was last week.  Maybe it was the week before.  Then it was a good one.  Oh, I was â€“ I got to sleep at 2.30 in the morning after a drunken poker game and had to wake up at 4.15.  So a couple hours of sleep, still buzzing but feeling like starting to get hungover. 
[02:18:00]  Did the CBS show.  It was fine there.  You know, I was tired and felt it.  But, okay, came over here, hit me out of nowhere just â€“ oh, my God.  Now I'm full-fledged hangover and I'm nauseous and I'm going to puke.  And these motherfuckers are so sympathetic.  They started bringing in things like turkey gravy soda and pea soup soda.  And Jimmy was eating, so the whole place smelled like bad sandwiches.  It smelled like sixth-grade cafeteria. 
[02:18:30]  And I finally just lost it.  I had to run out and puke.  We got the audio somewhere.  It was that fucking bad.  But if I â€“ these guys give me a cure.  If I'm able to lay in bed with a wet rag over my head and just kind of lay there with the TV on low and just moan and groan for a while, then I won't get sick.  I'll be fine.  But to actively have to do stuff, I'm worthless.  Done.  Useless.  All right, Glenn.  Thank you.  I love you guys. 
[02:19:00]  Jordan rules.  God bless, Glennie.  You're cold, huh?  I'm warming up now.  It's so cold in here.  It was so fucking cold outside.  Could be â€“  Why didn't you warm up our studio?  It's cold.  I don't know what happened.  What, are they bringing Anna Nicole Smith's body in here?  Oh, come on.  Wow.  Don't be fresh.  I don't know if it's the wind or what it is, the snow on the ground or what â€“ but I feel today the coldest fucking walkover we've had yet. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, it sucked.  I don't know if technically the temperature was colder than it was on any other walkover, but I fucking was freezing the entire way.  Yeah.  Brutal.  I want a limo.  I want a helicopter.  Take a â€“ just hop me over here.  Right around St. Paddy's Day, we'll bring the walkover back to the people.  That's March.  Yeah, we got another month.  All right, here we go.  Mike Tyson.  Yes, this video is up on a website called GorillaMask.net. 
[02:20:00]  Wow, that figures.  That's where it belongs.  I said it first.  What?  Today.  What?  What?  Didn't y'all do that joke two days ago?  No.  Yes, you did.  I just think I heard the Gorilla Mask.  Boy, we're too smart for you, Ralph.  What joke.  About what?  You don't miss a thing, do you?  What was it about?  No, I laughed at it then.  I laughed at it now.  The whole Gorilla Mask.  That's where Tyson's video ought to be.  Yeah.  See how that hurts?  Because it figures.  Exactly.  It's a montage of some of the crazy things Tyson has said over the years. 
[02:20:30]  Let's get through this.  Yes.  Yes, lock the door so we don't get any nudity.  On lockdown.  Yeah, let's get into lockdown.  No male nudity.  There we go.  I may like quanticating more than other people.  It's just who I am.  I sacrifice so much of my life.  Can I at least get laid?  You know what I mean?  I've been robbed of most of my money.  Can I at least get a blowjob?  There you go.  Yeah, that's a nice one.  Officer, I've been robbed.  Here, have this woman suck your dick. 
[02:21:00]  By the way, UJ from Maine.  The jerk, you know, whacking off to help a hangover.  He writes, the jerk releases endorphins and dopamine.  And then he writes, sorry, I forgot learning is for queers.  Learning's for queers.  What doesn't a jerk make better?  There's really nothing.  Even a funeral.  I'm going to miss her.  Not that much.  Well, now I'm hungry.  Now I need a sandwich.  It's also on Break.com, this montage of Tyson saying some of his crazier stuff. 
[02:21:30]  Here's the next one.  I wish one of your guys had children before I could kick them in their fucking head or  stomp on their testicles before you could feel my pain.  Because that's the pain I have, waking up every day.  I wish you had children.  Who wants to fight that guy?  Why do you want the guy?  Like, that's his idea of a reference.  Yeah.  I wish you had.  Like, how do I express how I'm in pain?  How do you express the pain I feel?  I wish I could take your children.  I hope you have some.  And kick in their heads and just step on their testicles. 
[02:22:00]  Stomp the testicles.  Stomp them, yes.  The balls of little babies.  That's what he wants to do.  Little baby balls.  He wants squished under his feet.  Instead of licking them.  And no one has the balls to ask the follow-up question.  Yeah.  You know.  Like, would you kiss the balls and make them better after you stomped on them?  Right.  It almost be worth getting your teeth knocked out for the fucking.  He had free reign.  You're not going to see a guy like this anytime soon.  You're right, man.  You won't, unfortunately.  There you go.  Is this your shortest fight ever?  In any time?  Amateur professional ever? 
[02:22:30]  As-salamu alaykum, Maida.  Um.  I don't know, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lennox Lewis.  Lennox, I'm coming for you.  Oh, that's not what you want to hear.  The guy kind of laughed, too, as he was asking.  Because you could tell Tyson must have looked like, what?  What's this?  Because it's the longest fight I do.  Don't kill me.  Don't kill him.  I want to talk to Dan.  Can we get Dan on the phone? 
[02:23:00]  Put him on hold, buddy.  Can you put him on hold and stop talking about hookers with the guy?  It's time for us to talk to him.  Thank you.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, how are you?  I'm good.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  Dan.  What's up?  Welcome aboard.  Oh, boy.  What's up?  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Screeching halt to the show.  Why don't you just say, hey, how you doing?  Hey, guys.  And then you go into what you want to talk about.  Yeah.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, guys.  Just a second, dude.  What's going on?  No, Jimmy. 
[02:23:30]  Jimmy, why?  Why did you do that?  Sorry.  Go, Dan.  All right, Dan.  We're ready for you now.  Go ahead.  Come on.  Hey, boys.  How y'all doing this morning?  Cool, man.  What's going on?  What's up?  Hey, wanted to ask old Norton if he's ever had any hookers out of Mexico when he does any  gigs here in San Antonio area, if he even comes down here.  Never been to San Antonio.  I'm going to Addison in a couple weeks, but I've never been down in that part of Texas.  I've only been to Mexico once.  Cancun.  Cancun.  Did you partake of any of that?  No, I did nothing.  No, I just shot something for MTV, and I finally drank a cappuccino, which had water in it. 
[02:24:00]  So it was 115 degrees under the lights on a beach at 10 o'clock in the morning, and  I was...  My asshole, I fucking...  Like all those Terra chips that they served on JetBlue, I felt like someone rubbed them  against my fucking ass crack.  You ever have salt and vinegar potato chip, asshole?  Where it's raw and tender?  You had a chaplain walk so your cheeks don't rub together?  Yeah.  Chaplain walk.  Baby, you got to check out those whorehouses, man.  Nah. 
[02:24:30]  Dude, at one point I would have.  But I have a girlfriend that I can't be fucking around.  I'm a good boy.  Yeah.  But thank you.  He's playing it safe right now.  I have to be good.  Yeah.  We fucked last night.  Hey, but they're great, man.  They're great.  I'm like, hickey.  You can get a full...  Argued.  All the way around the world, man, for shit.  Oh, yeah, cool.  I'm looking at the menu, Dan.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, Dan.  I'm sorry.  I was just...  Sorry, but you...  Sorry, I was just trying to...  I love that.  Looking at the menu.  It was something for she and I.  I was talking about, like, yeah, maybe we...  I'm looking at the menu. 
[02:25:00]  Right?  I hope it says oil...  Vinegar and water.  A little misty.  Does anybody remember last night?  Ah, yeah.  What is that?  That was one of my favorite clips, though.  Does anybody remember last night?  Oh, that's Robert Plant.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:25:30]  Does anybody remember last night?  What song was that in the middle of?  Is that song remains the same?  It's in the middle of...  Stairway?  I think it might be in the middle of Stairway.  That's fucking...  From Zeppelin?  Yeah.  Dude, if you gave me a thousand guesses,  I would have fucking probably wasted three or four before I got that.  Perhaps more than that, gentlemen.  I have a bunch of guesses left over for the next question.  Dane Cook looks like Gibraltar on this.  Yeah, it's not a flattering article on Dane.  I mean, all the cover's hilarious.  Well, it's in Mad Magazine.  What's supposed to be?  An in-depth interview?  Dude, they are brilliant people. 
[02:26:00]  This is brutal.  This is like Joe Rogan wrote it and put it on my face.  Man, that is...  Wow.  Yeah, they took that Rogan stuff down from YouTube.  Well, call us Mencia, claim copyright.  Yeah.  I don't know how he could claim copyright, though.  In California...  You gotta explain it to everybody.  No one knows what you're talking about.  Really?  Okay.  Really?  I mean, some of the faithful do.  Well, Rogan and...  You're right.  Rogan and Mencia don't like each other because Rogan's always accusing Carlos. 
[02:26:30]  Carlos is like...  Look, I mean, there's rumors that he's taking stuff.  And, you know, Rogan is very vocal about shit like that.  He's smashed Dane.  Rogan's a ballsy guy.  Yeah.  And he went after Carlos on stage, not physically, but verbally at the comedy store.  And there's a comedy store.  Carlos is sitting there on a stool.  And Rogan is pretty ballsy because he has no mic.  And him and Carlos are yelling at each other.  And then someone hands Joe a mic.  So he's accusing him of stealing.  And now they're fucking...  Rogan...  It was so funny because on Rogan's website, they had this.  And there's obnoxious Mexican music. 
[02:27:00]  And, like, in between clips, it goes...  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  And they show a clip of a comedian doing a bit.  And then they show Carlos doing it years later.  And I guess this was on YouTube.  Yeah.  Because Carlos didn't look good in it.  Really bad.  And they said Mencia had it taken down because of copyright.  How could he take it down for copyright?  I don't think Rogan did because Rogan was just...  Rogan, I'll say one thing about Rogan.  Whether people like him or not, he's an honest guy.  Rogan's an honest dude, man.  How the fuck can...  Rogan shot it, right? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, but I mean, maybe...  One of Rogan's guys shot it.  I'll tell you why.  I'll tell you why.  Because they were showing footage from Mencia's performances that you're not allowed to show.  Probably an HBO clip.  Stuff like that you can't show.  Cut that out.  Well, you know, he also...  In the state of California, you can't video someone without them knowing it.  What?  Even if you're a part of it?  Even if you're a part of it.  What about public?  That's why they couldn't record Michael Jackson and the Learjet.  They had all those recordings.  And they couldn't use them in the trial. 
[02:28:00]  In California, it's against the law.  Who recorded them?  The Learjet people.  But this guy, Joe has a guy who follows him around and takes everything he does.  Red Band.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Not much.  Actually, he not only just pulled that video, he had YouTube cancel my whole account and  I lost all my videos.  Oh, no.  You know...  Yeah, he's playing hardball and he got Rogan banned from the comedy store.  Yeah, he did.  I heard that. 
[02:28:30]  How did he do that?  For what reason?  He told the owner or whatever, the manager, that he felt threatened.  Even though he was the one that...  What happened is Joe got off stage and Carlos bumped his chest when he walked by and grabbed  the microphone from the next comic and called out Rogan and told him to come on stage and  started calling him like, little bitch and all this shit.  Is that how it went down? 
[02:29:00]  And then Rogan just fucking...  Why?  What happened is Joe got off stage and when he was getting off, Mencia just bumped him.  Like, kind of like chest bumped him.  And then got on stage and grabbed the mic from the next comedian and just started going  off on Rogan.  And then Rogan got on stage and that's how the whole thing started.  Here's how badly Rogan has affected Mencia.  That Mencia knows that if he had to fight Rogan, Rogan would murder him.  Murder him.  And that's...  He'd murder all of us.  And he knows that he has been so bothered by Rogan. 
[02:29:30]  Like, Rogan is affecting him on such a...  His masculinity on such a level.  He's brutalizing him that he had to bump...  It's almost like I have to do something and I know I'm going to get killed for it.  Yeah.  Even if he's not afraid of Rogan.  You know what's amazing with Rogan?  Like you said, he could kill any one of us.  Anyway.  Those fucking big dumb Boston hands.  And Mencia was calling him a little bitch.  He goes, yeah, you little bitch.  You little bitch.  Not once did Rogan bring anything physical into it. 
[02:30:00]  Not even verbally.  He didn't even say like, look, I'll kick your ass.  Or you know I could beat you down.  Or he kept it exactly where he wanted it kept.  Yeah.  You're doing this.  This is how I feel about you.  Fucking...  You're doing this to other comedians.  You're ripping this off.  Whatever.  Whatever the argument is.  He never brought it down to like...  And he was being taunted by being called a little bitch.  Yeah.  That's something you turn around and go, little bitch?  I'll show you a little bitch.  Yeah.  Why don't we step outside?  Rogan, though?  Or just smack him right there. 
[02:30:30]  Rogan kept the fucking thing exactly where he wanted it.  He kept it right on topic.  Yep.  He kept it on topic.  And I got to admire him about that.  Little bitches...  Here's what little bitches is.  Little bitches is all...  Like, if you're arguing with somebody and that's all you have...  Like, what...  Because Rogan's not a thief.  Yeah.  Rogan's not a hack.  No.  And what are you going to say, Rogan?  You're dirty.  I mean, there's really...  What are you going to attack him on?  You're successful.  Oh, you just met...  You fuck a lot of hot women.  You just met because I'm styling on you.  That's what he should have said.  You just met because I'm styling on you. 
[02:31:00]  Where is that?  And bam, right in the face.  I love that clip.  Well, the greatest thing is that after they got in this huge argument and whatever, and  Carlos just got beaten and the crowd was just booing and everything, Joe decided to  get off stage.  And then Carlos tried to do a set after that.  And he couldn't even get through, like, half a joke.  And finally, it was, like, 30 comics in the back of the room going, na, na, na, na.  Hey, hey, hey, goodbye.  Wow.  And then Mitzi Shore called up and told him to get off stage.  It was that bad. 
[02:31:30]  That's really humiliating for comedians.  I mean...  For comedians.  This is...  I mean, you know, we're the only art form that does this shit to each other.  You know?  This is brutal.  Everybody...  Man, I...  You know, if two magicians want to fight, you know, they don't do it on stage in front  of them, you know?  It's like, we're the only entertainment group that does this to each other.  Except for rappers.  Well, yeah.  Well, they just shoot each other.  They just shoot each other.  Well, radio guys...  Radio is...  Same shit.  Radio is kind of, yeah, that you're ripping me off thing. 
[02:32:00]  So, yeah.  That happens.  But comics are just notorious.  So, Red Band, where are we at with this whole thing?  Um, well, right now...  By the way, you made a point about YouTube.  They stink.  They're so...  You fuck up one time.  Like, obviously, a lot of us are putting up videos all the time.  And one...  Uh, one fuck up and they delete your whole account.  That's bullshit.  Yeah.  They gave me a warning when Rogan sent me all those, uh, puke contest videos.  And I was putting it up on Joe's website.  Yeah, we got... 
[02:32:30]  We got...  We got fucked really bad.  We lost a couple hundred at one time just because one of our videos, uh, you know, were  against their terms of service or whatever.  And that's just a horrible way to do business.  That's why we're, like, uh, focusing more on Break.com and other, uh, other video sites.  But go ahead, Red Band.  Exactly.  Well, one good thing is, is that even though Joe got banned, the improv on Melrose gave  them, uh, three nights starting them Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  So, they're going to take care of Joe, supposedly.  So, but, uh, right now, Joe, uh, put out on his MySpace and his website, um, uh, explaining 
[02:33:00]  the whole thing and giving the, uh, phone number to the comedy story if you're, if you want  to call them and say thank you or whatever.  Well, Rogan can't do the Laugh Factory, I guess, because of the whole Jamie Dane thing,  so.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow, he's sure is, uh, burning some bridges.  But he's not, he's not burning, he's fucking just speaking his mind, man.  Yeah.  He's just attacking other comedians for what he sees as thievery.  And what is, uh, you know, and Carlos is a better invitation for that.  Uh, Red Band, the video's up on Break.com right now as we speak, so. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, or Red Band.com has a whole bunch of links if that goes down.  You know, the, the joke in question, though, that, that, that they had to bring up is one  of the most beaten jokes out there about the, uh, Mexican wall border.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And Ari's claiming it, and it's like, you know.  Yeah, but Ralph, Ralphie, the thing is, though, is that Ari used to open up for, um, Carlos  when that first happened back in, like, 2004.  Oh, really? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, so.  See, I didn't know that.  It was a joke.  Yeah, so I understand it's hacky, but, you know.  Well, yeah, I've heard it on, like, Craig Ferguson.  I heard him do it one night.  That guy's terrific.  Wow.  I heard Jay let him do it.  It's kind of an easy joke in the news, but it's like.  Yeah, yeah.  But, uh, if Ari did it first, and they were working together, then, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  Yeah, there's a video that he even said, oh, Ari never opened up for me, but later in  the video, he goes, no, that was after that.  Like, he just got caught in a lie thing that he never opened for him. 
[02:34:30]  All the comics on that tape that just were like, yeah, yeah.  Does he steal?  Does he steal?  And he's pointing right at him.  Rogan's pointing right at him.  And then the comics, like, yeah, yeah, he does.  You know, man, I don't even go in there.  When I'm at the comedy store, I'll stay outside and smoke weed with Joe Diaz until it's my time  to go up, and then I just go up, and then I come right back out.  Get caught up in the soap opera, that is, though.  I don't at all, dude.  I don't get caught up.  You're never going to catch me on tape being in the back of the room watching somebody. 
[02:35:00]  No, Jack.  Because even the cross-pollination is so, I mean, there's such a finite, if you're doing  this type of comedy that I do or like Norton does where it's, like, topical-driven and  then it's wrong and controversial, man, you can't be near anybody.  I don't.  I don't go down.  I haven't been here for three days.  I haven't gone to a comedy club yet.  It's just bad news, man.  I just got to have a few laughs.  Yeah.  A few chuckles.  I'm going to watch you at the comedians. 
[02:35:30]  I'm going to watch a sketch group somewhere.  Yeah.  It's a comedy made of a gun.  Get out of here.  Check, please.  Improv group.  Check, please.  All right.  Red Band, anything else?  Uh, nope.  That's it.  Thanks.  All right.  There he goes.  Red Band.  Oh, stop with the freshness, Ralphie.  I don't care who knows it.  You're my favorite comic.  All right.  Here we go.  More Mike Tyson.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This is on the front page of break.com as well.  I'm the best ever.  There's never been anybody as ruthless.  I'm Sonny Linton.  I'm Jack Dempsey.  There's no one like me.  I'm from Nairclaw. 
[02:36:00]  There's no one that can match me.  My style is impetuous.  My defense is impregnable.  And I'm just ferocious.  I want your heart.  I want to eat his children.  Praise be to Allah.  Oh, shit.  Wow, man.  Ending it with praise be to Allah.  Praise be to Allah.  Wow.  Yeah.  I wonder if he does cocaine and then goes, praise be to Allah.  Praise be to Allah.  His Muslim face didn't last very long.  No.  It really didn't.  No.  Is he still a Muslim?  Do we even know?  I think he is.  I think he is. 
[02:36:30]  I think he's doing bums for Allah.  You know?  That's great.  Praise be to Allah.  Yeah.  I want to eat his children.  Yeah.  That's not good.  Muhammad never said that.  No, no.  Mike, why do you have to talk like that?  Well, I'm talking to you the way I want to talk to you.  You have a problem?  Turn off your station.  You know what?  I think we'll end the discussion right now.  Then we could.  You got it.  Have a nice fight, Mike.  Fuck off.  Good for Tyson. 
[02:37:00]  Fuck off.  Yeah, that was on live TV.  Good for Mike.  I was that sports reporter from New York that used to wear the sweaters.  I don't know if he's still around.  Warner Wolf?  No, no.  What the fuck is his name?  Douche a bagger?  Yeah.  Fucking.  I hate.  He's fucking.  Good for Tyson.  Like, Pryor had a great point years ago.  Like, how much do you hate?  Like, he hates when people call Leon Spinks dumb.  Because, you know, no one said that the heavyweight champ had to be an entomologist.  Leon, what do you do? 
[02:37:30]  I knock motherfuckers out.  It's like, that's what these guys do.  And it's like, don't expect him to not be himself when he's talking to you.  He fucking punches people in the face for a living.  Why shouldn't he curse at you?  Fuck you.  Why am I angry?  I knock motherfuckers out.  And that was fake toughness, too, by the sports guy there.  Oh, yeah.  He's scared shitless.  He's got three security guards.  You can hear the scared shitless in the tone.  And Mike said, I'm talking the way I want to talk to you.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  Love Mike Tyson.  I won't talk nice to you and talk about faunicking with you and letting you suck my 
[02:38:00]  because if I was eloquent with you, you would still look at me as a scumbag.  There you go.  Elegant look.  Yeah.  There you go.  You're not going to accept me anyway.  He's right.  He's right.  You're going to look at me like a fucking vicious animal anyway, so go fuck yourself.  I'll be back off.  Yeah.  You're killing people out there.  It's like, you have the loudest voice.  We love you, but back up a little.  Russ Salzberg.  All right.  Sorry. 
[02:38:30]  Don't be too sad.  Don't be sad.  They're screaming at me, so I got to take care of the levels here.  Otto's here.  All right.  Very cool.  Who?  Otto.  Where?  Otto.  Where is he?  Where is he?  Get him.  I'm not yelling.  I just like to bust people around.  Open the door, Stan.  As he's walking towards the door.  I'll whisper.  That's the same thing.  Let's tell him we were just kidding about coming by today.  Hey, Otto.  How are you?  Hey, what's up?  Otto.  Hey.  How you doing, man?  All right.  Pink rats, Otto.  I'm cock-blocking him now with the comedy. 
[02:39:00]  No, it doesn't matter.  It's a good clubhouse.  Yeah.  Bunch of boys taking their cocks out and making some comparing.  We're talking about Mike Tyson there, Otto.  Okay.  I feel like I'm looking at a star.  Look at this.  He was just on TV last night.  On TV.  Same guy.  You look very good on TV, too.  It really annoyed me.  You're very handsome.  No, no way.  No, no way.  Go fuck yourself.  This thing ain't on.  Do you guys know each other?  Huh?  You know each other?  I've never met you.  No, I've never met him. 
[02:39:30]  I know this is Rolf.  Okay.  I've only seen your TV.  I've only seen your movies.  Oh, yeah.  Which one?  The Christmas one.  Yeah, this headphone's working.  No, they're on now.  There we go.  I'm freaking freezing in here.  It's so cold?  Oh, man.  Oh, that walkover killed me.  It was real cold today.  How was the walkover yesterday?  It must have been horrible.  It was horrible.  It's every day.  It's just been an awful frozen mess.  This wasteland.  Possible plane crash on TV.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:40:00]  It's a Leo jet with landing gear problems.  They're following it, though.  So it's got a circle a thousand times until it runs out of gas.  Gear troubles near L.A.  And then the professional pilot with one hand tied behind his back and a mirror over his shoulder is going to land it.  Why not just dump the gas over a black neighborhood?  And then crash the plane into it.  It's Ontario.  It would be a Mexican neighborhood.  Like, boom, meet him.  Yeah.  All right.  Back to the Tyson.  Here we go.  Well, let us know.  I'm a big, strong nigga that knocks out people and rapes people and rips off people. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Is that his resume?  That's his fucking, that's his match.com profile.  Yeah.  Great people.  Just bring Otto up to speed.  There's a video up on break.com.  It's a montage of all the crazy shit Mike Tyson has said over the years.  Oh, great.  It's just, it's awesome.  He's wonderful.  We love it.  Here's the next one.  You can't touch me.  You're not mad enough.  I'll eat your asshole alive, you bitch.  Wow. 
[02:41:00]  Did he say, I'll eat your asshole alive, you bitch?  Yeah.  You bitch.  That'll show him, Mike.  Only Tyson can say that and no one would even think that he's gay.  No one would even think that he has gay tendencies.  Yeah.  That's how you straighten another man out.  You eat his asshole while he's still living.  While he's still living.  He could be coming in.  Savage.  Got its gear down.  He could be coming in.  Yeah.  With gear trouble.  All right.  Let's see what happens here.  I'm trying to see what's wrong.  Life.  He knows.  Well, they got a few second delay in case it's a crash. 
[02:41:30]  They won't show it.  Is he a Yankee pitcher?  Really?  I bet it.  Yeah.  Well, let's go to the...  Is it David Wells?  Go to the audio.  See what they're saying.  Shh.  The airport there in Dunes, Bermuda Dunes, Palm Springs, California, so not going very far.  But it had left from Ontario, though, Chad, so it had just taken off, in other words.  I don't know that it just took off from there.  I just know that they're going to use Ontario as the emergency landing for it if it needs to do that.  All right.  Still looking for the takeoff place.  All right.  So let's assume for a moment here, Heidi, we've got somebody early in the flight. 
[02:42:00]  They tried to retract the gear.  The gear didn't retract properly.  That's a possibility.  We're going to have to watch that.  But in the meantime, as I say, they're not going to land heavy, and there's no hurry to land, is why you're trying to troubleshoot the gear probably.  Which is a really good thing, because lots of times when you have a weather situation and you're carrying passengers, you mentioned the type rating and the way that these guys train in order to get themselves through weather situations when the landing gear is not quite fixed the way they want to.  We could very easily see, hopefully not, but another belly landing like we saw, I believe it was just a couple of weeks ago, wasn't it? 
[02:42:30]  I just want to say, as you slam into the cornfield, good luck.  This ain't happening at any time soon, right?  Can somebody play Big Bopper for us?  No, they're going to just try to fix it.  Where's Sam, by the way?  Sam.  Did OA videos get deleted last night?  Holy shit.  OA videos fought the farms out.  Fuck YouTube.  OA videos fought it.  Fuck them in there, fuckholes. 
[02:43:00]  What happened now?  We have no clue.  Steve and me both have emails going out, so hopefully YouTube will contact us and put it back up.  Oh, thanks.  So which videos does that mean?  All of them.  Like how many?  How much?  How much?  All the ones that I have put up.  How much raping material did you do on Nicole there?  Why would that be now?  What reason did they give?  We haven't got a reason yet.  I've got emails out to YouTube.  They are West Coast.  I'm waiting to hear back to them.  We don't know what specifically set it off, but they yank first and then tell you why they did it later. 
[02:43:30]  Did you have, what video did you have up there that you thought might be, uh, the Inside Dave shit?  No, no, that never went up.  Oh, that never went up.  It never went up.  But, you know, anything that's too sexual, anything that is too abusive.  You know what it is?  It's a lot of times competing shows, stations.  They'll rat out a page, if there's too many popular videos of the radio show on there, and say, oh, they're a copyright infringement.  And then they pull it off. 
[02:44:00]  Somebody flagged something, which anybody can flag a video.  And I guess if enough people flag something, they yank it.  I had to find out the message boards and stuff that it was gone.  There you go, pest.  Have fun with YouTube.  Go fuck yourselves.  Break.com.  I blame the toothpick guy.  The what?  The fucking toothpick guy.  I don't even think that was up there.  The hand didn't even make it up.  Is that on there?  No, he was just mad.  God damn, that pisses me off.  Yeah, it's really enraging. 
[02:44:30]  Fuck.  Scumbags.  Yeah, it's YouTube.  They want to be mainstream.  Break.com.  That's it.  They want to be mainstream.  They want to be bought by a huge entity that can't be troubled with boycotts.  How many videos were on that?  Faggots.  Hundreds.  Yeah, there were hundreds.  Everything.  Pretty much everything.  Everything we've ever done here in the studio.  Yeah, it was our official account.  And they fucking yanked it.  We have a ton of accounts where maybe it's a little shaky, so we'll use one of these other  accounts in case it does get dumped. 
[02:45:00]  Because like we were saying with Red Barn or whatever the hell his name is.  Red Band.  Red Band.  One bad video, they take everything off.  You know what?  That's such a stupid policy.  Let's just leave it a sight of young girls talking from their bedroom.  Guys doing wacky dances together.  That's always fun.  Two guys doing a wacky dance to some music.  Lip syncing to an NSYNC song. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  That's great stuff.  Let's get Doug Out Doug on the line.  A barren wasteland.  A waste of fucking bandwidth.  Doug Out Doug, what's up?  Hey guys.  What it is is Stern Fan Network.  They report the ONA YouTube on like a daily basis, multiple times a day.  And then it's just the chance of getting somebody that's going to check out the report.  Because they report it as copyright violation.  Oh my God.  How's the copyright?  It's our material.  It's not like what they put up. 
[02:46:00]  A TV shit and all of Howard's fucking pay-per-view crap.  That ended up on this YouTube.  Yeah.  I mean you and I know that.  But the idiot at YouTube looks at it, sees that it's a XM radio broadcast and they dump  the whole account.  That's what's going on.  Fuck those assholes.  I guess they're a little nervous over there, huh?  That their hero's not as popular as he used to be.  Get back to them and they'll probably call it back on.  Get fucking YouTube on the phone. 
[02:46:30]  Steve, please.  Where's the honcho?  Weren't we supposed to have him on once?  Yeah, let's get Chad on the phone.  Get the fucking honcho.  We hung out with a fucking guy in Vegas.  Call him up and have him on the phone with us.  We want to speak with him.  We want to know why.  Alright, I'll work on it.  This isn't copywritten material from a TV show or something.  This is shit we shoot on a video camera in...  Hey, we give permission.  I ran into this in West Palm because we had the same issue then.  They won't come on the phone with us, but I'll try again. 
[02:47:00]  Well, at least find out why.  I'm trying to know why.  Why?  Why?  Hey, why?  That's my girlfriend Trish over there.  Hi.  We met her last summer.  She's very nice.  She's beautiful.  What a sweet girl.  She is a sweet, sweet girl.  You're not as self-destructive.  Her head is shaped like an anvil, but it's pretty nice.  An anvil.  But it's a nice anvil?  Yeah.  But she has a good heart.  She's blushy.  She's blushy. 
[02:47:30]  Blushy.  How good was he last night?  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  That was my favorite part.  And what about Letterman?  He was good on Letterman too?  Yeah.  Missing the stupid handshake.  I was like, it was so many socially awkward moments we've had out.  Okay, Otto's like, all right, we'll go to dinner.  Okay, okay.  Anything just to be left alone.  Well, would you go to dinner with somebody who liked your show?  No, nor would I promise them to.  Yeah.  I shouldn't even make the promise.  Of course I shouldn't.  I get the point.  Just give that his cell phone number.  Why did I call you?  All right, here's the next Tyson. 
[02:48:00]  We play this one already, right?  This is the ultimate, man.  Fuck you, you hoe.  Come and say to my face, I'm fucking your ass for everybody.  You bitch.  Holy shit.  He's mad.  Out of control.  He got mad.  A little bit.  He's an angry guy, man.  You can't touch me, you're not mad enough.  I'll eat your asshole alive, you bitch.  I'll eat your asshole alive.  You bitch.  This is the ultimate, man.  Fuck you, you hoe. 
[02:48:30]  Come and say to my face, I'm fucking your ass for everybody.  You bitch.  Wow, the guy wrote it out for me.  He said, Mike's going to fuck someone's ass in F-T-O-N.  F-T-O-N of everybody.  F-T-O-N.  Front?  No, I know.  It's supposed to be in front, but that's how he said it on the clip.  F-T-O-N.  That's how I picture the rape happening.  Like, he was in that hotel room that Broad wasn't like, she was definitely coming on  to him, but maybe he was a little too aggressive. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  And she was like, hey, slow down.  Slow down.  I'm Mike Tyson.  I'm fucking slow.  I'm going to eat your fucking ass.  And like, before you know it, she's just getting pile-dried by some fucking beast on the bed  and goes, she just at one point, it hit her head like, bing, the light bulb.  Holy fuck, I'm being raped.  You know, by Mike Tyson.  Wow.  This is one of our favorite ones right here.  Did he do time for that?  Oh, yeah.  A little bit.  Rape him.  A little bit.  Yeah, just a bit.  Four years?  Yeah.  Look at you, scared now, you hollering. 
[02:49:30]  Scared like a little white pussy.  Scared of the real man.  I'll fuck you till you love me, faggot.  Hey, Tyson.  Oh, she's great.  I'll fuck you till you love me.  Oh, is he great.  That's beautiful.  These are usable.  Wow.  I think he's in bed with you.  Oh, I'll fuck you till you love me?  That is some fucking.  And then ends it with, you faggot.  You faggot, yeah.  He's going to be fucking him, but he's the faggot. 
[02:50:00]  Logistically, it doesn't even figure out.  No.  And once again, you look at it and go, there's nothing gay about what he's doing?  Nah.  He's just teaching that guy.  Yeah, it's...  Wow.  It's nothing gay there.  He's fucking another man up the ass, but he's teaching him a lesson.  Yeah.  There's nothing gay about it.  Nothing whatsoever.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Is this guy still walking around out there?  What a beast.  Imagine, like, you just fucking fresh meat in prison, and it happens to be the same one 
[02:50:30]  he's in, and you're just like, I gotta take a shower.  It's been weeks.  Yeah.  And you walk in, and there he is.  Naked.  Just fucking naked in a bad mood.  Mad at white people.  And you just walk in with your little fucking bar of ivory soap and your washcloth that  they give you.  Oh, and you just...  And you have no choice.  They told you it's time for a shower.  There's no looking tough.  You're not gonna...  All right, I'll just look tough in front of him so he can leave me alone.  Yeah.  You've decided you're not gonna shower your whole time in prison, but they finally got 
[02:51:00]  to, like, hey, man, I'm sorry.  It's rules.  You have to shower.  The best you can possibly do is use your little washcloth and soap to wash his dick off.  Right.  So it doesn't fucking give you a disease, maybe.  Your tiny little legs are shaking as you're walking into the shower.  He's soaping up his chest, and he's looking at you like, Wolf, in Escape from Alcatraz,  the way Wolf was soaping his chest, looking at Clint Eastwood, washing his chest.  Oh, shit, just a bad situation.  Nothing good could come out of that. 
[02:51:30]  Mike's raging hard on you.  You have to look at it.  He's so big and powerful.  He's got that tattoo he's got on his face on the head of his cock.  Oh, God.  Fucking Tyson, man.  Has been a LIGO.  Fucking all multicolored.  Like a fleshy speed bump.  Full of stupid jeans.  Wow, that is scary.  Knock drugs out of your life by just saying no.  Was that a PSA?  Yeah, he says don't do drugs, but don't do drugs.  Can we hear that last one where he fucking threatens to fuck the guy again? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, that's a great one.  That's a ringtone.  Look at you scared now, you hog.  Scared like a little white pussy.  Scared of the real man.  I'll fuck you till you love me, faggot.  And listen to his voice.  He's fucking just pissed.  It gets better every time.  He is so, yeah, you faggot.  Best part is faggot.  Faggot.  Wait, you're fucking me, Mike.  Yeah.  How am I?  You're going to tell him that? 
[02:52:30]  No.  Of course not.  Fast Friday, Tyson is the ultimate power top.  Oh, yeah.  He's no bottom.  No.  It's not going to be like, you know, can I roll over and maybe you fuck me now?  No.  You will never hear that.  Just blood and that fucking red tube sock that would be pulled out of your ass when he pulls his cock out.  Although your asshole skin would attach to his dick.  Oh, yeah.  What did Tracy Morgan say?  It's like a wizard's sleeve.  Yeah, wizard's sleeve.  That's what Morgan said.  That fucking pocket would just come out like turning your fucking pant leg inside out. 
[02:53:00]  Your asshole would come pulling out with his dick.  Like a dog when it's scooting on the rug, trying to clean its anus on a shag rug.  You ever see a dog when it presents, when it like shows its fat pussy because it wants you to mate?  Yeah.  Dogs, or baboons do that too.  Pussies swell up to induce the male baboons into sex.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's see what's going on with the jet.  Let's see if there's anything new here.  Running off fuel, not dumping it, so that could take some time.  We are hearing that it's possible or due to land in about a half an hour or so. 
[02:53:30]  That'll be 10.  Oh, my God.  We'll still be on the radio.  Uh-huh.  Boring.  We just did 20 minutes of material, and they're still trying to land this dump thing on CNN.  And they're also fighting over the body there.  Edna and Cole Smith, big fan there, Otto?  Big fan of the story?  Oh, yeah, I was in Vegas when I found out she crawled.  You know, whatever, fuck her.  Fuck her.  Fuck her.  Yeah.  She's on ice now.  They're trying to decide who gets the body. 
[02:54:00]  Anybody know?  No.  Inconclusive is what the autopsy was.  Inconclusive.  They haven't buried her yet?  What are they, keeping her around like a PlayStation in the living room or something?  They got to keep her around.  Apparently, some judge said, I'll keep her around, you know, as long as I need to.  She's on ice.  Oh, God.  Keep her around for months.  Don't worry about it.  She's mine now, is what he said.  Really?  Yeah, because they might need some kind of tissue samples for DNA when they do a paternity test  to find out which of the 50 guys that we're fucking are in apparently three days. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  Maury.  The test is...  Oh, man.  Inconclusive.  Oh, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Dead corpse of fucking whore out on stage.  You're a special dead big whore.  Yeah.  Fucking Maury.  Love him.  Here we go.  Here's the next clip.  This is a great one.  I'm not confident in my journey that you can win this fight.  Are you talking out of turn?  No, I think we're all talking together. 
[02:55:00]  I normally don't do interviews with women unless I fonicate with them.  Ha!  Don't you shouldn't talk anymore.  Unless you want to...  You know.  You're so savage.  Holy shit.  I don't talk to women.  I fonicate with them.  Ha!  So unless you want to...  And then he, like, blaze it right out and then he gets a little coy.  Unless you want to...  You know.  Now he's getting all, like, here's his sensitive side. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, here's my sensitive side.  He's the silky rapist.  Yeah.  Hey, this is a very good question today.  Mike in Jersey.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, Mike.  Hey.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Is Mike Tyson the scariest human to ever live?  That's a very good question.  Scariest human to ever live.  A lot of people would go right to Hitler, but was he actually scary himself?  Person to person, Hitler, you could probably kick his ass.  Are we doing person to person, Mike?  What are the rules of this game you're starting? 
[02:56:00]  Average Joe beats the shit out of Adolf Hitler.  Yep.  Genghis Khan.  What about your Genghis Khan?  What about Idi Amin?  He's a tough guy.  Idi Amin.  Again.  Could you kick Forrest Whitaker's ass?  Yeah.  He's kind of fat.  He's kind of...  I don't think he was in the shape that a Mike Tyson...  And he didn't have that single anger like his own.  He was able to get other people to do his dirty work.  How about Dahmer?  How about some of those guys?  Marco Cro Cop. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, that guy's pretty scary.  He's a fucking ultimate fighter.  But is he scary?  Yeah.  Does he say shit?  Does he mouth off like that?  He doesn't have to.  The black guy, the ultimate fighter that just came to the UFC.  I forget his name.  Yeah, but see, Mike's got both things.  Mike's got the mental fucking damage, and he's physically able to tear you to pieces.  Yeah.  Like a wild animal.  We only got to see Tyson under control in a ring.  Yeah.  The ultimate fighting wasn't big back then.  Yeah.  Can you imagine what he would do in the UFC and shit? 
[02:57:00]  Big elbows in the face.  Bam, bam.  Yeah, Muay Thai, somebody with those sharp knees.  Oh, I don't like to think about it.  That's a great question.  Harry, I would say most frightening single person.  Jeffrey Dahmer's frightening in a creepy way.  But again, out on the street without his fucking drugs and his little drill bits into your head  and fucking Drano syringes, you beat the shit out of him.  Yeah.  He's not scary.  He's a fucking nerdy looking glasses.  Bernie Getz, same thing. 
[02:57:30]  You know, guns down, four guys in the subway.  But, you know, without the gun, he's just some nerd.  You punch him upside the head.  Mike Tyson in any situation.  What about the Iceman?  I was thinking of him.  All right, the Iceman is pretty good.  Yeah.  He's a pretty scary guy.  What about him, huh?  That guy.  Let's go to the phone.  A lot of mob guys, I think.  Very scary.  This guy's scary.  But he was fucking.  All right, see, people aren't getting the bit.  Rich from D.C., um, with a lot of M's. 
[02:58:00]  Bin Laden?  No.  No.  He's a sick, he's diabetic.  He could kick his ass.  He could kick his ass if no one else was around.  Pull his beard.  Kick his ass.  We're talking mano-a-mano.  Right, we're not talking, like, the power that he's got behind us.  Let's get Spanish listeners.  Robert Reed with a paper cut is scarier than fucking Bin Laden.  That's true.  Yeah.  Chasing you around the house.  No.  Let's say hi to Tripp in Georgia.  Tripp.  Hey.  Yo, Tripp.  What about Gangster Fag?  Yeah, Gangster Fag.  Gangster Fag. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Gangster Fag.  A buff, black fag who wants to, uh, wants to, uh, rape, um, like, rednecks that are racist.  Yeah.  And does rap songs about it.  Another one Rogan turned this on to.  People are saying, uh, Suge Knight.  No.  Suge?  No.  Wait a minute now.  Let's think this over here.  Mano-a-mano.  The guy's scary.  Tyson?  But he's got a, he's got a posse, too.  No, not scarier than Tyson.  Scary. 
[02:59:00]  Not scarier than Tyson.  No?  Oh, and I'm talking old school Tyson.  You could outrun Suge Knight.  The sound clip Tyson we're getting.  Not the now Tyson.  The stage manager on more sports, uh, was in high school football with him.  His name's Puma.  And he knocked Suge Knight out.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, he says he's got a glass jaw.  Yeah.  That's what he said.  Not me.  Eh.  Well, it's great.  I don't need that drama in my life.  Yeah, you, uh.  What about Gotti?  What about Gotti?  What about, uh, Sammy Gravano?  Gotti on his own?  Uh, well, I don't know. 
[02:59:30]  They're all tough guys, man.  I mean, Gravano's a friend.  Yeah, I was saying.  Every, every mob guy, most of them, anyway, tough guys.  I, I guess you gotta take weapons out of it.  Yeah.  You gotta take weapons out of the mix.  No guns.  Just, we're talking just guys.  That black guy, that UFC, that guy who beat Chuck Liddell and, and pride fighting in  Japan.  That, I can't remember his name.  Washington?  He is huge.  Diesel Washington.  Probably Kevin Randleman.  He's, uh.  Yeah, but would he, we're not just talking about, can you kick his ass or not? 
[03:00:00]  Because there are plenty of people you, that could beat the shit out of you.  No, those guys are killers.  But are they as frightening because they have that mental fucking, I'll eat your ass, I want  to step on your children's fucking testicles, you know?  That fucking guy could be the scariest human ever.  Oh, I don't know.  Most prize fighters probably have that level of anger, but they, they don't scream it out  in public.  Yeah, yeah.  Blurt it out in public on a mic.  And go, to go into any fight game, you have to, you know, want violence in a daily basis, 
[03:00:30]  you know?  Yeah.  You gotta want to beat the shit out of other people.  Sure.  Until they fall down unconscious.  Yeah.  That's, that's not a hell of a gig, man.  Smash.  Yeah, okay.  Oh, good question.  Well, we're getting some info on the Iceman.  Yes, of course.  Let's remind people.  Yeah.  Richard Cliff, he's very cool.  Richard Cliff, yeah.  He's dead.  Six, five, three hundred.  You're kidding!  Three hundred and something pounds, and he once choked a guy with a wash line over his  back.  He was like Santa holding a bag of toys with a human eyes. 
[03:01:00]  Holy shit, like he grabbed them, and then over his back, like Santa holding a little  sack of toys, he pulled the guy up and choked them.  Oh, yeah, yeah, he hung them from behind.  Oh, is that fantastic.  How do you stop that from happening?  How about the arsenic, like in the Coke?  He'd spill arsenic on the drink on him.  Didn't he dress up like a homosexual and go to a gay bar and stick a guy with a needle  through?  No way.  Yes, he did.  And then he shot a guy with a crossbow at a bus stop just to see if it would work.  He just wanted to see if it would work. 
[03:01:30]  He was bored that day.  Holy shit.  He had to kill a very high-profile target, mobster or something, who you couldn't get  near, so he went somewhere dressed as, I think, a tranny, and he was completely over  the top, like so noticeable, everybody looked at him.  So he was all over the place.  He was like, this guy can't possibly be here to kill anybody.  And he had some kind of a needle with poison or something in it, and that was how he did  it, like a little...  Yeah.  Like one of those.  Yeah.  And it was brilliant.  Like Gene Acron and Birdcage with a giant transvestite head like that.  Yeah, exactly.  That creepy. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, God.  It was that guy in England that got nailed with that friggin' umbrella, that fucking  gag umbrella.  The guy, Hitman, had an umbrella.  Oh, yeah.  And it had a little bit of that poison in it.  On the end, yeah.  What's it called?  Risen?  Yeah, yeah, whatever that shit is.  Oh, right.  That's real.  A little Risen.  That shit, like a fucking grain of sand of it in your system, and you're dead.  Yeah.  There's no fucking antidote.  There's no fucking movie cure.  Yeah.  And the guy had an umbrella with the tip of the umbrella was a little holder for this  little grain of sand with a needle on it. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  And he walked past this guy and just, just, doink, hit him, and the guy just thought  he got hit with an umbrella.  He's like, hey, what the fuck are you doing?  A few days later, dead.  Dead.  It was just a few days later.  But by the time you get into the hospital, they don't know what it is.  Yeah.  They're looking for, you know, the flu.  Meanwhile, you've been fucking poisoned by something.  Yeah.  That's some scary shit.  Very, yeah.  That's James Bond shit.  All right, we got another one coming in.  Scott in New York.  Go ahead.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I think Jimmy would agree with me on this one.  Ed Kemper, the serial killer. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, Edmund Kemper was a very scary guy.  He was a very scary guy.  Big?  Six, six, three something.  Oh, shit.  Serial killer.  He's the one that kind of decapitated the girl and put her head in a bowling bag and  talked to his mother because he hated mother.  And hated mother.  And then he violated his mother's body after he killed his mother.  Oh, all right.  He did things with the body.  Edmund was a scary guy.  And Robert Ressler, FBI profiler, interviewed Kemper in a cell.  And the guard had left for whatever reason.  It was like he was doing something else and he was a shift change. 
[03:03:30]  So Edmund Kemper says to Ressler in the cell alone, he goes like, you know, I could kill  you now.  And there's no one here to stop me.  And Ressler said he realized that there was nobody there.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  What do you do?  This is a six foot six.  Get a picture of Edmund Kemper.  He was probably like Jones in to kill somebody.  Yeah.  Do the lambs cry.  Well, Ressler played it off somehow like he had a weapon.  Because, again, he's a profiler.  He goes like, yeah, do you think I'd come in here and not have something that would  fucking put you right on the floor?  He didn't show any fear. 
[03:04:00]  I don't.  But do you think I will next time?  Holy shit.  Yeah, he's scary with his 70s.  Look at him.  He looks like fucking a 70s porn star.  He's a killer.  You got to show him next to somebody.  Edmund Kemper.  Look up Kemper and Robert Ressler.  He's a big kid.  Yeah.  So I don't know if he's the scariest ever.  Big, goofy kid.  He's a big baby.  The California court killer.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  That looks like a circus act.  Wow.  Yeah.  He's your suit.  Wow. 
[03:04:30]  Wow.  I could kill you.  What must have gone through that guy's mind at that second where he went like, oh, my  God.  Did he fuck up by looking around?  Or did he just keep looking at his eyes and go, no, you think you could.  Believe me, I've taken care of things.  Or did he go, I could kill you.  And the guy then goes, uh, and starts looking around like, is somebody going to fucking help  me here?  No, he gets those guys.  You realize you're the, you're the ham in the cartoon.  Yeah.  Done.  Done. 
[03:05:00]  All right.  Let's get back to the Tyson.  We got a couple more clips here.  Listen, I've been working with Kevin for two and a half years.  I've never seen him prepare himself like he has.  I'm going to get him like a fish.  Sit down.  He's focused.  You're thinking hard on him.  He's focused.  And he positively believes he can knock out Mike.  Oh.  Sit down.  Did Mike say sit down?  Yeah, sit down.  Yeah.  Just done even.  I'm going to do what?  Like a fish?  Bread him like a fish?  Got him.  I'm going to gut him.  I'm going to gut him like a fish. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  He's like Clubber Lang at his press conference.  Hey, woman.  Did Tyson retain any of his wealth or is he just like a...  He's broke.  No, he's fucking broke.  Yeah, he's fucking...  He's working out the YMCA in Hollywood.  Really?  Yeah.  Part of his rehab.  Wow.  He's just, he had so many fucking vultures around him that just like rate them of his  cash.  He made fucking millions, man.  It's so easy for that to happen.  Just millions.  It happens so often that it's weird when it doesn't happen.  Yeah, yeah.  You look at someone like George Foreman who like took money and was smart with it, investing 
[03:06:00]  and then came up with that stupid fucking grill that he's just a gazillionaire with.  That's so rare that you get somebody.  Usually they're just fucking, you know, I'm broke.  It's business management.  That's what it does.  Those business managers that pay and you pay twice for services.  It happened to us.  You get an eight, you get a fucking 80 person posse that are all driving fucking Escalades  and, you know, on your dime 24 hours a day. 
[03:06:30]  It don't matter if they, they don't bill you.  They're just fucking dipping into cash.  Yeah.  God bless you.  Oh boy.  Thank you.  You all right, sweetie?  Oh, Otto.  You all right?  You sure?  Yeah.  You need a tissue?  Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  You got your late show with David Letterman t-shirt on.  Oh, yes, I do.  Sweet.  I got to get out of this building.  I got to get some fucking fresh air.  I went from one stuffy room to another.  I hate it.  Yeah.  Just live in this fucking nasty environment. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, I can't open a window.  Oh, God.  All right, here we go.  Here's another clip from Mike Tyson.  I'm 36 years old.  I'm 36.  I never dreamed of living this long.  I never dreamed of fornicating as many beautiful women as I did.  Fornicating.  Fornicating.  He's so romantic.  We got a quote there, Stan?  Go ahead.  Fornicating.  We got a quote from who?  This is Kemper when he was in the cell with Resser.  Oh.  The exact quote is, if I went apeshit in here, you'd be in a lot of trouble, wouldn't you? 
[03:07:30]  I could screw your head off and place it on the table to greet the guard.  Oh, nice.  Screw your head off.  Screw your head off.  Wow.  He would just twist it like a jar lid and then leave it there.  And the guard would walk in, and he'd probably just be sitting there.  Hey, how you doing?  Wow.  That?  Oh, yeah.  That's the guy I was just talking to.  That's his head.  The beauty of him, psychologically, he had game.  Who?  Kemper?  Oh, yeah.  He had game.  That's a scary guy right there.  Well, what's scary about that as well is that as an FBI profiler, I mean, Rustler coined 
[03:08:00]  the phrase serial killer.  He's the one that made that phrase up.  That you understand that this guy is, first of all, he's never getting out of prison.  So if he murders an FBI agent in jail, he's a god.  You kill an FBI agent in jail and you are a god.  Especially if you just unscrew his head with your bare fucking hands.  You get free cigarettes forever.  Oh, you're in.  Cigarettes, snicker bars.  That's it.  That's what you want.  Anyone you want to rape is yours.  Wow.  We got one more to go here.  I can't wait till the 28th.  I'm going to make you my girlfriend. 
[03:08:30]  There's something you can't buy in that class.  You don't got none of that.  You're sweet.  Make sure you kiss me good with those big lips.  That was nice.  Fucking Mike, man.  Wow.  Yeah, I guess so.  That's it.  The video is up on break.com on the front page right now.  It's a montage.  That was a shame watching him go out like he did where he just said, nah, I can't fucking  fight anymore.  In the middle of the fight, it was just his last fight.  Yeah.  In the middle of the fight, he just came out.  He was getting the shit beat out of him.  He came out to the bell. 
[03:09:00]  He threw a few punches and then just turned around to the ref and went, I'm done.  I can't do this.  And apologized to everybody and said he just doesn't have the heart for it anymore.  Yeah.  And that was it.  He was done with fighting.  Like went out with a fucking fizzle like that.  The Learjet landed safely.  I will surround you like a wagon train.  Wait, they didn't show it?  No, because Bush is talking.  Because Bush is talking about some bullshit?  Yeah, because Bush is talking about something.  Some nonsense.  Afghanistan.  Afghanistan, Iraq, you. 
[03:09:30]  Don't you have faggots?  Language.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Let's take a break and we will return with...  What happened?  Well, hopefully we get to the bottom of the YouTube thing.  Oh, that ain't going to happen.  You think we're getting a fucking call from them?  All right.  That's it.  All right.  It just makes us play harder, that's all.  It's fine.  And now, look what's on there.  Like, there's fucking, like, Japanime on there. 
[03:10:00]  It's really full of crap.  It's a waste of fucking bandwidth.  I've been taking off.  What's up, Steve?  So let him sit there.  Some other thing will come along.  What do you got?  What do you got?  We got Roland and I are hitting them from...  Why would your mic be on?  We've only been doing this for two and a half years.  Why turn that mic on?  Yeah, there's no reason to...  Bill, is it on?  Now it's on.  There we go.  Roland and I are hitting YouTube from as many angles as we possibly can,  but they are West Coast and they generally don't start working until it's...  10 o'clock.  Yeah.  Well, hopefully we'll find out by tomorrow. 
[03:10:30]  I heard that Real Steve Bray was going crazy over the whole Carlos when you see Joe Rogan thing.  And that's gone to...  They stepped it up at YouTube and across the board they're hammering.  Like, they took off...  I had a video up there of me as Ann and Nicole Smith and Jay Moore playing Larry King.  They yanked that.  Why?  They didn't say.  They didn't say.  There's no...  They don't have to say.  They just violated our terms of service. 
[03:11:00]  What are they?  We make them up as we go along, so go fuck yourself.  That's pretty much it.  They're just going to fuck themselves over.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Otto?  Yeah.  Stick it around?  I've got to go to Staten Island.  I've got to pick up my dog.  She's got to drive back to the city after that.  I'm pretty exhausted.  My dog's at my mom's house.  You had a big day.  Yeah.  You had a big night.  Getting a lot of calls today?  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, I probably will.  I'm going to be on Penn & Teller's bullshit, too.  That's going to be amazing.  Yeah.  I'm doing a thing on Exorcism.  I filmed that already, so two TV shows in one week. 
[03:11:30]  Look at you.  Wait, it's going to be on this week?  No, that's going to be on in April.  All right, remind us, will you?  Yeah, absolutely.  I want to come back and do a full performance here, because it's been a freaking long time.  Where are you working this weekend?  Anywhere?  Nothing to plug.  Zaney's in Chicago.  I've got that coming up.  Okay.  All right, you doing Vernon Hills, too?  Yeah, all three.  I'm doing three in a row.  Vernon Hills is brutal.  Oh, I love it.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, hey, Vernon.  There's nothing to do there.  No, there's nothing to do there, but, you know.  It sucks.  It's the biggest room.  It's got the most seating. 
[03:12:00]  It sucks.  Yeah.  I just stay in my room and smoke weed.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Right on.  All right, well, Otto.  So you guys are huger than ever, right?  It's getting there.  I mean, who am I to say?  I don't know, Otto.  Oh, I don't know.  We're feeling good.  It's a country ass.  Huge.  You know, we're getting there one day at a time.  We don't know.  We just do our silly show every day.  Oh, stop that.  They're not like that.  I'm Maddie. 
[03:12:30]  Hi, Steve.  I'm out of here.  All right, Otto.  Thanks for stopping by.  Thanks for doing my segment this morning.  That was good to wake up.  That was great.  Really nice of you.  Thanks.  And we like your chick there.  She's very sweet.  She's very nice.  We've hung out with her at the ONA Travel Environment.  Frontier quality, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Frontier quality.  Yeah.  Square.  Yeah, look at that.  Oh, my God.  You're so nasty.  Who's the other girl?  Frontier quality.  Yeah, she does.  She's like a frontier woman.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, take you down to the river.  Like Karen Grassl from Little House on the Prairie. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  Wholesome.  It's a wholesome look.  Yeah.  It's a very outdoorsy, wholesome look.  She's like, all right, wrap it up.  Open the wall.  Your family like her, Otto?  She's the pale rider.  What?  Your family like her?  Does what?  My family?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They go, she's like family.  Shut up, Mom.  You ruined my life.  Why do you think I talk through a puppet?  Yeah.  Look in the mirror.  Seven-year-old boy stuck on a bus.  Yeah.  Stupid.  Got stranded on a bus when he was seven and didn't know how to open the door. 
[03:13:30]  Hard day's play makes you weary.  Aw.  Yeah, I got trapped on a camp bus.  I fell asleep and they locked me in the bus.  Yeah.  And my mother was sure that I was dead at the bottom of a lake.  But this one woman, Sylvia Dale, figured out maybe he was asleep on the bus.  Because the driver said that right before he takes the bus back to the garage, he goes down  a steep hill and anything in the back would have fallen on the floor.  But somehow I didn't roll off.  I was, you know.  Well, that's a nice safety feature.  The child will roll to the front of the bus. 
[03:14:00]  It was the 70s.  Yeah, they didn't care.  That's normal for the 70s.  They didn't care at all.  Now there's a bunch of pussies out there raising their kids.  Wow.  How did you remember that?  He told me this story.  How can I ever forget it?  Did you see you fucking trapped on a bus and frightened?  Yeah, that was my first.  I dozed off to that thought.  My first publicity.  He was talking to himself like this to keep himself company, right?  No, no, he said that he had a paper, an article, right?  He had a fucking newspaper article.  Yeah.  Never got locked on a bus, but as a kid, in kindergarten, I think it was, something, maybe 
[03:14:30]  first grade, but really young and scared of everything, I took the wrong bus.  I was supposed to take bus D, and there was a big D in the window, and I took bus C by  accident.  So I hopped on the bus, and I'm sitting there, and the door shuts.  It starts taking off.  And the first indication, you kind of start looking around, and you go, hey, I don't  know these people.  These aren't like the people that I'm usually on the bus with. 
[03:15:00]  So you start getting scared, and then the bus makes that turn.  The wrong turn.  The wrong turn.  And you're like, oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no, I'm just a kid, and I have no way out of this.  Yeah, the panic.  Oh, I fucking lost my mind.  And the funny part is, ew, you crying?  Oh, I was crying like fucking crazy.  Ew, high school?  He's asking policemen for help.  17.  The sad part is, you're only one town over.  Oh, it doesn't matter.  Yeah, you don't know.  It'll be another state.  Once that turn went, you know, because you know you're like a little fucking rat through 
[03:15:30]  a maze kid.  You know where the cheese is.  It's home.  You know how to get there.  Did you talk to the driver?  No, I couldn't fucking communicate.  Oh, I was, I was like beside myself.  I just started crying going, I don't know, wrong bus thing.  Where am I, mommy?  Snot bubbles and all.  Oh, snot bubbles and tears and my big fucking alien eyes just crying to the bus driver.  It was horrific. 
[03:16:00]  And the bus driver just freaked out and had to actually take me back to the school.  Oh, yeah.  I lost my mind so much he had to turn around and I don't even know how far into the trip  he was.  It wasn't that far.  Yeah.  But he had to turn around and take me back and open the door.  He's like, get the fuck out.  Oh, yeah.  You're freaking me out.  With the snot and the tears, yeah.  Before you start accusing me of shit.  Yeah.  Get the fuck off my bus.  He touched me.  How did he not rape you?  Because you were so confused.  You would have been like, oh, he's on the wrong bus.  He's on the wrong bus.  What does he think?  He got ass raped too?  Fucking kid. 
[03:16:30]  You guys are too much.  Little bloody bottom.  Give you a reason to cry.  You disrupt her.  Oh, it's like a whiny little mess.  All right, Otto, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Otto, thanks.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  Great job.  We're taking a break.  Are we?  Mickey.  Yeah, we're going to take a break.  All right.  Bye.  Bill, get us out of here.  The Norton and Faggot Show.  That's what we should call it, program.  I know how to handle cock.  All my cocks got in.  iPods. 
[03:17:00]  Corn on the cob.  Smoothies.  Egg white omelets.  Bagels and seltzer.  Never.  Starbucks apple cake.  Absolutely.  And rollerblading.  White cocks.  Black cocks.  Two fruits.  Two fruits.  Two fruits.  I know how to handle cock.  Not only do I know how to handle cocks, I love doing it.  Over here, Anthony.  Yeah, fuck North Korea. 
[03:17:30]  Yep.  Get that right.  Fuck them in their little shitholes.  We were trying to get syndicated there.  Yeah.  I think we'll do well.  Anthony brought up a great point about the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[03:18:00]  I can't do it justice, Ant, so if maybe you can.  Well, it was the whole reason that Tom Chiasana was there for the time that we're over at FM.  Yeah.  On FM radio.  Yeah, they trust us at XM.  They really do.  There's no one running this place.  We're left alone.  I had no idea who's in charge, to be honest with you.  Who knows?  I thought you were.  There was a guy that was in charge.  He had a cubicle.  I forgot his name.  He's long gone.  We pretty much unlock the place every day.  We're on our own here. 
[03:18:30]  But over there.  Munch put her in charge.  Right.  But over there, it was obvious that the company said, look, we're going to hire these guys.  But look, they're loose cannon.  So, Tom, you're going to have to be there every single morning when they brought to make sure they don't screw up.  And I said, well, wouldn't you?  Because we have this thing when we get angry, like we just decide to blow things up.  Yeah.  We decide to just blow up our career.  Yeah.  We are like Kim Jong-il.  We just don't care. 
[03:19:00]  We get a little mad.  And our reaction is, fuck this.  Let's just blow it up.  Fuck it.  Like the littlest problem.  It's like, guys, yeah, today there was an issue with the show.  I believe you were supposed to do a read, and it was supposed to be the first read of the block.  But you did it last.  All right.  Fuck it.  We're going to go fucking to church.  Fuck everyone.  Blow this shit up.  We'll show you.  Go fuck yourself.  I don't know why we're like this. 
[03:19:30]  No one amazed me.  Back in the day at NAW, there were times we should have been fired, and they never fired  us.  And Ant and I would be on the phone with each other that night going, not only did we not  get fired, they're kissing our asses.  And I was like, can you believe they didn't fire us for that?  And they're like patting us on the back?  There were days.  I guess we can tell people now.  Got to take it further.  There were days that we just didn't feel like doing our radio show, and there was a lot  of drinking going on and stuff, and we would just be just, whatever, hungover, tired, what  have you.  We would make up some kind of drama and then go, you know what? 
[03:20:00]  I got to tell you, Ken.  If we go down that hall and do a show today, I can't promise you that we won't say something  that's just going to blow up this whole thing.  Going to fuck this whole thing up.  We would start like fake fights with Howard.  I mean, we had our problems with Howard, but that was always the easy one.  Like, what can we say about Howard today that will really, like, get them scared?  And we'd make up this shit, and he goes, yeah, I see it your way.  You're right.  Why don't you guys take the day off and calm down?  Like, yeah, I think it's good for everybody. 
[03:20:30]  And then me and Ann would walk out of the building going, did that actually work?  We just got the day off.  We got the day off.  Fuck it.  I guess we can admit that now.  Well, I can.  There are times where we weren't prepared, or we just were unhappy.  With our personal lives.  Something was going on.  I'm like, you know what?  Do you feel like working?  Nah.  Like, Kent, let me tell you something.  And then we would just think up this whole scheme in our office and go, all right, I  got it.  We'd march down to Kent's office and go, Kent, can we talk to you?  We'd close the door and come up with some crazy-ass thing. 
[03:21:00]  And he would buy into it, because they were so paranoid and scared that we were going to  blow it up.  That we were going to blow up our careers.  But wasn't that, like, harder to do than actually doing the job?  No, it was fun.  It was fun?  It was fun.  It was fun.  It was like, we didn't want to go in there and do a show that day.  We were just, like, miserable.  We had nothing.  Yeah.  So we're just like, yeah, let's just march into Kent's office.  We'll make something up that will lead him to believe we're going to do something really  bad on the air.  Yeah.  And he'll say, why don't you guys just take the day, you come back in tomorrow fresh, 
[03:21:30]  and we'd be like, all right.  Yeah, yeah.  At that point, we're like, yeah, but Kent, we really want to do our show today.  We want to do the show, but if you know something, I think that's a good idea.  Yeah, like he came up with it.  Like, Ken, I think that's a wise decision you've made, Ken.  We would always lead the boss on, too, to make it seem like he came up with it.  Yeah, wise decision.  All right, we'll come back tomorrow fresh.  That's why you're the boss, sir.  We'll sit.  Unfortunately, you know, we'd like to do a show today, but, you know, you're showing 
[03:22:00]  your wisdom.  It's like when you're a kid, you don't want to go to school, so you're fake sick, and  when your mom goes, you should stay home.  You're like, I guess, if you want me to.  Yeah, exactly.  I have a report due.  I studied so hard.  I had a report due.  What a bad lie that would be.  Oh, I know.  You know what we, to get out of a test, we, my grandmother had Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.  She had a lot of drugs around, and there's something called Halidol, which is, it's like 
[03:22:30]  a clear, it's like a date drug, a date rape drug.  Date rape.  Yeah.  And we put it in our teachers.  And it was for Alzheimer's?  Yeah, it's to knock them out.  It knocks you out.  So you can rape them.  Crazy.  No, no, not that.  All for the Parkinson's?  For the Parkinson's, and we dropped, like, one drop is for an adult, and we put, like,  five drops of this stuff in our teachers, because we had a test.  My biology teacher, Mr. Gibson, who was the doctor.  Oh, that sounds great.  Dosing the teacher.  Yeah.  You read about that in the paper all the time, when they arrest the fucking kids. 
[03:23:00]  I know.  We should have been arrested for it.  Our shop teacher was arrested for dosing the principal.  Wow.  What?  Fucking, yeah.  He's a wrong teacher of crime.  I don't think it was to kill him, but he put something in his drink.  We all knew the guy was creepy, because he had a thick mustache, and he tucked in  his flannels.  Always the sign of a creep.  When you tuck in flannel shirts, you're an El Creepo.  So, and he...  Well, you want a good presentation.  Oh, you mean his...  How do you say this?  How do you say this?  How do you say this?  His bulge.  Yeah, bulge.  Because the front of the flannel gets real fat in there.  How do you say it?  We're over here.  He wanted to make his cock look good. 
[03:23:30]  Hey.  No, but does that mean there was a sexier way?  Like, his...  Oh, yeah.  All right.  His, uh...  But you want to call it a meat stick or a baby wrecker?  I had a fucking girl jerking me off one time.  She was a massage therapist.  And, uh...  How was it?  She was fucking...  Phenomenal.  She was tugging my dick and kind of, like, playing with it.  And she was going, give me this meat stick.  I like this.  Now you get a great fuck stick.  She's calling my dick a meat pole.  It's like something you pick up at fucking Home Depot, though. 
[03:24:00]  It's like, yeah, meat pole.  I need a meat stick and a meat pole.  It sounds like one of those greasy beef jerky things.  Or that, yeah, that you get on a gyro cart.  I'm having my ass eaten on my hands and knees, just kind of humping into her mouth.  Oh, God.  I was like a dog.  It was awful.  Jimmy!  I was rubbing my dog pussy on the carpet.  Jimmy!  That is just something that won't be done.  Scooting.  Second scooting joke of the fucking session. 
[03:24:30]  That is something I would just not allow a girl to do.  I gotta say.  Let's lick my fucking ass.  What's wrong with you?  I'm a man.  Who'd you vote for?  Fucking Brezhnev?  You're a commie?  What kind of an American are you?  No, that makes me a commie.  After all, we are not communists.  I love my asshole being eaten.  Well, there's one thing about loving it.  There's one thing about putting someone in an awful position.  Wow, hands and knees, my asshole open?  Lick away, gal. 
[03:25:00]  That's the awful position.  What's wrong with that?  I don't know.  It's just something that seems very...  Like, degrading.  Oh, that's wonderful.  You look back at her and you're like, hey.  How you doing?  Oh, you look down between your legs, kind of...  How you doing?  Hey, what you doing back there?  She's like, blue, 42!  You both laugh.  It looks like an aardvark.  It's a bit of a visual.  Oh, that's horrible.  Hey, we gotta get to another big story here. 
[03:25:30]  Ooh.  This is terrific.  Tim Hardaway, just speaking his mind today.  Oh, yeah.  Well, he's gonna catch a little flack for this.  Well, the setup is that one of these NBA players came out and said he was gay while he was in  the NBA.  Oh.  He's now retired, but he said, hey, man, I played for...  I think he played for four teams in five years, something like that.  Yeah.  And admitted that he was gay.  So it's been a big story on the old sports radio channels.  And Tim Hardaway just went off yesterday. 
[03:26:00]  This is great.  With former NBAer John Amici revealing he's gay, former NBA all-star Tim Hardaway had this  to say on Dan Levitard's radio show.  Tim Hardaway, last question before we let you go.  How do you deal with a gay teammate?  Wow.  Last question before I let you go or you hang up on me.  That is a radio technique right there.  Nice.  That we don't know how to use, unfortunately.  And any time... 
[03:26:30]  We always ask that question first and then we get the hang-up.  And how does he go through life with a last name that has TARD in it, that ends in TARD?  Isn't that the guy's name?  What's the sports guy's name?  I don't know.  That's doing the interview.  I forgot.  I heard his name, but it's something TARD.  Well, let's go back.  Yeah, let's hear his name because, boy, the teasing in fucking school.  This is...  TARD.  Textbook radio, though.  Yep.  You get all the info out of Tim that you need, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then you finally ask the question.  Hit him with the one he might just hang up on.  Yeah, you really want the answer to at the end. 
[03:27:00]  With former NBAer John Amici revealing he's gay, former NBA all-star Tim Hardaway had this  to say on Dan Levitard's radio show.  You fucking Levitard.  You fucking Levitard.  Like, how did he go through his school with that name?  Levitard.  You floating fucking dummy.  Yeah.  Talk about pressure.  You have to get A's every time.  Yeah.  Fucking Levitard the retard.  Yeah, I know.  You got a D, you Levitard.  Fucking Levitard.  Tim Hardaway, last question before we let you go. 
[03:27:30]  How do you deal with a gay teammate?  Oh, first of all, I wouldn't want him on my team.  And second of all, you know, if he was on my team, I would, you know, really distance myself from him  because I don't think that's right.  And, you know, I don't think that, you know, he should be in a locker room while we're in a locker room.  And it's just a whole lot of other things.  So I wouldn't even be a part of that.  But, you know, there's stuff like that going on, and there's a lot of other people out here like that 
[03:28:00]  that's still in the closet and don't want to come out the closet.  But, you know, I just leave that alone.  He's been in a locker room with a gay guy.  You know what?  Wait, wait.  That's what he said?  No, well, it gets a little better.  I hear other quotes.  Yeah, because he got pushed after that.  I want to replace the word gay in here and on his interview with black, though.  So, do that. 
[03:28:30]  See how that fucking pulls off.  Well, I'll say this.  He's getting a lot of flack.  Black guys are getting shit now, like, whereas years ago they didn't, political correctness.  But he's catching a lot of flack.  It's like headline news in a lot of places.  Like, he's getting a tremendously bad...  He'll have to apologize.  Oh, fuck yeah.  He will apologize.  He's at the end of his career.  He's not going to apologize.  I hope you're right, dude.  I don't think he apologized, and I don't think that they really care.  I mean, the NBA doesn't cater to gays except for the WNBA.  It doesn't matter who caters to who anymore.  Once you fucking say something like this, organizations come out, and you're a fucking... 
[03:29:00]  You're the devil.  Yeah, the devil.  Yeah, you're the devil.  You can't speak your mind in America anymore without having to apologize.  He's retiring, but he's at the end of his career at this point.  But what do you think he wants to do?  Just not do anything?  Do you think he wants an endorsement thing?  He'll collect his cash.  He'll sell cars.  He'll sell cars.  Gun collection.  Suck cocks.  No, the NBA will make him apologize because the advertisers, the gay groups will pressure  and say, we'll have to apologize.  That's what they do. 
[03:29:30]  You're absolutely right there.  Well, David Stern's the biggest douche.  Douche.  Douche.  David K. Stern or David Stern?  Which one?  Ha ha.  Man.  You know that what you're saying there, though, Timmy, is flatly homophobic, right?  It's just flat.  It's bigotry.  Listen to this.  Well, you know, I hate gay people, so, you know, I let it be known.  I don't like gay people.  I don't like to be around gay people.  I don't, you know, I'm homophobic.  I don't like it.  It shouldn't be in the world for that or in the United States for it. 
[03:30:00]  So, yeah, I don't like it.  Well, tonight, likely within the last 30 minutes or so, Hardaway has apologized for the remarks.  Oh, good already.  The former All-Star said he was sorry and should have never said anything.  Hardaway's saying, quote, yes, I regret it.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said I hate gay people or anything like that.  That was my mistake.  Shouldn't have said it.  End quote.  Thoughts from Tim Hardaway tonight.  I still believe it, but I shouldn't have said it.  Yeah.  Why does he care?  Who cares if he hates gay people?  And Hardaway is retired. 
[03:30:30]  Thank you for that update.  Is he retired?  Yeah, I thought he was still playing.  Who cares?  Yeah, if he doesn't hate gay people.  Dan knows, no?  It's not that important.  This will just promote gay bashing and people to, you know, they ought to, but the black  community, this is what I'm saying, ought to look at a statement like this and then look  at when Whitey turns around and says something about black people and take that in the same  fucking vein.  Well, you know, just don't, does he want to be left alone? 
[03:31:00]  I know.  I'm flabbergasted.  I was just going, line of the day, me going, there's so many rumors about guys being on  the down low and they say that the gayest sport is football, that more football players  are gay.  Really?  Yeah.  Why football?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  But they, it's pretty apparent. 
[03:31:30]  I would think the two-man luge myself.  No, because here's why football, because if you fall with the ball, all the men jump  on you.  Yeah.  You just want to run and fall with the ball.  I got it, guys.  It's an instinct.  You want to jump on them as soon as possible.  Tackle him.  Everybody's jumping on you.  Bunch of men in your face, your asshole.  I got to start paying attention to the NBA again.  I used to love the NBA.  Hardaway retired in 2001.  Holy shit.  Are you kidding?  Wow.  What?  Fuck.  Dude, that's six fucking years ago.  Holy shit.  Like, is he retiring? 
[03:32:00]  Why?  Why is it even relevant?  I love it.  When is the Mick going to retire?  I love that guy.  DiMaggio.  What a player.  We got a gay guy on the phone, Ed.  Hey, gay guy.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, what's up there?  Hi.  Yeah, you're gay, all right.  What's up, Ed?  My response is gay people hate niggers.  Wow.  You know something?  I guess you are well within your right to say that.  I am.  Although, did he use any derogatory terms for gay people? 
[03:32:30]  No.  Did he say faggot?  Nope.  Queer?  Nope.  Peter Pumpkin.  Do I say those?  Butt pirate.  No, he didn't say any of those.  Rump wrangler.  No, he just says gay people.  Cocksucker.  Father Disappointer.  All right, Ed.  Little Marianne.  Thank you, Ed.  Thanks, Ed.  Little Marianne.  Ed, Ed, Ed, he gave me a head.  The ozone midget sighting of the day.  My girlfriend's here.  That's, don't get that. 
[03:33:00]  What?  It's not your girlfriend.  Oh, it's Jimmy's.  I'm sorry.  Oh, nice neck block.  Oops.  Oh, that's your girlfriend, Jim?  You fucking vampired him.  Yeah, you, you did that.  You vampired him.  Those teeth, that's what did it.  Wow.  Is it okay?  That's you, Jim.  Can we talk to you, or are you reading the menu?  I don't get it.  I love it.  All right.  I love your relationship. 
[03:33:30]  Why is she yelling?  She's like, I didn't mean to.  Cause of blood clotting.  Yeah, whatever.  Can we get her on the air for a second, or is that, uh...  If she wants, yeah.  Hi.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  What?  Like, I need this.  My girlfriend that will remain nameless.  Can you hear us?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Now, why the hickey?  It was unintentional.  Never.  Crime of passion.  Yeah.  I didn't even notice it.  They noticed it.  I just walked in there.  Oh, boy, did we notice it?  God. 
[03:34:00]  You didn't notice it?  No.  Do you even peek in the mirror in the morning?  No.  You just kind of run out of the house?  Hold on.  What were you going to say?  Oh, boy.  When you said, do you have a peek in the mirror, she went, look at it, and somebody interrupted  her.  Oh, look at him.  Yes.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm looking at the menu.  What is that?  Oh.  Our Valentine's Day quarrel.  Yeah, a little quarrel.  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  It was brief.  Jim's very sensitive. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah?  Is that it?  He is very, very sensitive.  Not the way we heard it.  What?  If I'm hungry, isn't one of you like that?  Me?  Yeah.  I'll raise my hand.  You just get crazy when you're hungry.  That's it.  Ridiculous.  Yeah.  So, it was like you were reading the menu, and then Jimmy went to maybe just ask you.  He was going to spin a yarn.  He was going to tell a little anecdote.  Meanwhile, he orders the second he sits down.  He doesn't say, are you ready?  Do you know what you want?  Oh, you little rude.  He orders everything.  He'll order dessert when I'm eating dinner. 
[03:35:00]  You know what I mean?  How many times have you heard Jimmy go, a Caesar salad?  You could be in a sushi joint.  He's offering a Caesar salad.  Every time.  What's the matter with you?  I like to be ready.  I like to be prepared.  The waiter comes over just asking for the water order, and Jimmy has his whole freaking meal ready to go.  Yeah, he orders.  He doesn't even care if I've ordered or not.  And then he's telling me, launching into an anecdote.  So, he's ready to launch into an anecdote.  If you can remember, how did you actually present this? 
[03:35:30]  I got to see it like it was.  Because I want to imagine, across the table, my gal.  I'm telling this story, and she actually is mad with the men.  Thank you.  It was, um...  I've got to get into character.  No, he was telling me, what were you...  He wouldn't finish the story because he was pouting, but it was like...  It was a quote.  It was about a podcast, I believe.  Oh, man.  It was something about a... 
[03:36:00]  I love seeing you get smashed.  Oh, it's great.  It was, um...  It was a podcast.  Oh, man.  I do want to hear the end.  No, I forget what.  I started something about the Saturday.  You guys went to sushi.  Yeah.  You ordered right away, and she's trying to look at the menu.  You started with the...  It's Valentine's Day.  I won't even complain about the sushi again.  What?  You didn't mind if you wanted sushi.  Oh, it was a cold night.  Seemed like a cold meal. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, what are you fucking Japanese in a rice paddy somewhere?  It was not...  It was enough time for anything else.  How about something nice?  We went to one place, but they were sold out because...  How about a reservation?  Yeah, well, they were sold out because boyfriends had thought I had a reservation.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, is this too much?  No, that's not true.  We're watching the champ get pummeled.  Oh, the champ!  No, I don't even care.  Come on, champ!  Come on.  She's right.  We're really laid back.  We don't care about stuff like that. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Oh, she's crying now.  No, I was...  No, we just exchanged gifts.  You know, it was nice.  Did you like the card?  It was sweet.  Did he read it on the air as well?  Wasn't it funny?  It was, yeah.  Do we share anything between the two of us?  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah, it was sweet.  I thought it was very...  We all liked it.  ...4th grade.  Did you all hear it?  God damn it.  I didn't read it.  I would never read our private card.  I read it.  No, Anthony read it.  It was very 4th grade.  Very cute. 
[03:37:30]  Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.  Roses are red.  I love you.  We just read it among ourselves.  That's all.  Yeah, it was really, really cute.  That would be crazy to read it on the air in front of two countries.  Yeah.  Even Jimmy's not that stupid.  So you went...  So you went...  I'm reading the menu.  I was like...  No, I was...  It was one of those things where I was trying to be like a character, like a joke, like  someone who's irritated, but it was real.  I was like, can you give me a sec?  I don't remember.  That was awful.  I was just talking about one of the shows on Saturday.  So I'm like, yeah, on 202 this Saturday. 
[03:38:00]  I'm reading the menu.  Yeah.  Like, I was trying to joke, but it just clearly was real.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I wasn't sure if it was a joke.  Because I was thinking that's kind of funny to do, is sit there, and while you're looking  at the menu, because couples get conversed, even while you're looking at the menu.  Have you had your coat on the whole time?  I'm fucking freezing.  It's so warm in here.  In there.  It's warm in here now.  And it gets warmer when you're being grilled like this, believe me.  Well, no, she snapped at me.  But it's a funny gag, because couples, a lot of times, they have your menu, you're talking 
[03:38:30]  to each other, to just look up as they're talking and go, I'm reading the menu.  I actually kind of thought she was kidding.  It would be funny, yeah.  I'm like, that was so awful, she had to be joking.  And then she's like, I'm sorry.  I'm like, ugh.  Oh, my God.  She's a normal person.  You go, oh, I'm sorry, I snapped at you, I'm hungry.  And they're like, oh, fair enough.  But Jim was like, ugh.  You know what?  I never understood, and it's always done to them.  It's always done in the movies.  The instant apology.  It seems so weird.  It seems like only crazy people can do that.  Oh, good, good. 
[03:39:00]  It's like, well, you know, if you weren't the way you are, maybe we'd be in a better  shape than we're in.  And then go, oh, look, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to say that.  It's like a fucking De Niro character does that kind of thing.  You lose your mind.  Hey, I'm reading the menu.  Oh, look, I'm sorry.  James Caan did that, I believe.  Oh, yeah, Pop had Jenko, Pop had whatever, look who I got.  Look who I got.  Oh, Tom, I'm sorry.  Your mom made some dinner.  Your mom made some dinner.  Come on in. 
[03:39:30]  Only crazy people do the instant apology.  You've got to sit on it a little while.  Well, call me crazy.  Here's what it was.  My feelings were hurt.  Yeah.  I'm not good at saying my feelings are hurt.  Typically, I lash out in anger.  So I wasn't.  I was over it shortly after.  Just it was like I was.  Shortly meaning like an hour later.  All right.  An hour.  But I mean.  Hour.  He was like, goodbye.  Like we had to part ways briefly.  These were things that would normally drag out into a week long.  Really?  Incident for me.  I'm awful.  Like I.  You've got to an hour. 
[03:40:00]  That's good.  I react very angrily.  But I don't want to react angrily.  I'm like, just sit with it.  And your feelings are hurt.  It's like you have to deal with it.  And just process it.  So in the meantime, you just shoveled rice and raw fish heads into your mouth at your  romantic.  Just happy.  I was just quiet.  Happy Valentine's Day.  And I'm sure.  Drinking sake.  I'm sure the continental problem he was going through yesterday didn't affect your Valentine's  Day, right?  Do you know what he said to me last night?  We were making out.  And then he's like, I'm just thinking of airplanes and flights and stuff.  Oh, that's great.  We were kissing in my bathroom.  She was ready to take a bath.  And I was kissing her. 
[03:40:30]  And she's like.  I'm like.  I just kept thinking of the continental miles.  I just kept having a major airline problem with the continental.  I'm thinking of the continental miles.  While we're kissing, I'm like.  On Valentine's Day.  I have been robbed.  Happy Valentine's Day.  My continental has robbed me.  I'll get into it Monday.  They robbed me.  I go, do you want to take a bath together?  He goes, I have to go through an envelope of receipts.  Happy Valentine's Day. 
[03:41:00]  You sentimental fool.  I had to go through some receipts.  Oh, God.  I went through more receipts.  Yeah.  Boy, a lot of phone calls coming in.  Unfortunately, look at the time, Jimmy.  They're all supportive.  Yeah, well.  Anything else you want to share about your Valentine's Day?  No, it was really magical, though.  It really was.  Yeah.  It was a really nice time.  Yeah.  You guys exchanged gifts and stuff?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  No, it wasn't.  What happened?  I dropped my balloon on the way over.  I got a balloon at Dwayne Reed, and it fell out of my bag. 
[03:41:30]  What made you not pick it up?  I just showed up with these little conversation cards.  It was like a gag gift last minute at Dwayne Reed.  It was awful.  Oh, that's great.  Are there little conversation starters?  Yeah, like, what's your favorite band?  And then there's a card that's like, keep it a mystery.  You can keep it.  Yeah, like the mystery card.  If something comes up that you don't want to answer, you put the mystery card.  I could pull out the mystery card. 
[03:42:00]  Thoroughly horrid.  Wow.  It was an awful game.  That is really a bad gift.  Oh, it was terrible.  It was terrible.  We played it for hours, though.  Yeah, we did.  We couldn't stop.  Yeah.  Oh, you two fucking weirdos.  I love you.  All right.  You are very, very good together.  Yeah.  Because of the whole, you know, you not even thinking about making reservations on Valentine's  Day, and her at Dwayne Reed at the last minute trying to pick up a fucking balloon and lousy  cards.  It's between that and Pert shampoo. 
[03:42:30]  What a romantic.  No, what it is, I know her birthday is coming up, so we're going out to dinner next week,  and I knew everything would be crazy tonight, and she has to work, and I had to work,  so I knew we had different things to do tonight, and she'll be in Pennsylvania with me this  weekend, so I knew we were going to have a lot of time to get there.  Lancaster.  Lancaster.  Lancaster.  Lancaster.  Lancaster.  Lancaster.  Yeah, I'm a Scotch.  We might take a nice romantic horse ride or something.  Aw, and a little horse and buggy.  Yeah.  Real romantic.  The 20th.  20th.  It's coming soon, right?  Yeah.  Five days, Jimmy.  Yeah, so let's have good dinner. 
[03:43:00]  We're going to eat at a French restaurant.  We walked in there Christmas Eve, and I was so ashamed of what I was wearing, I couldn't  try to sit down, because we walked in, and every man is wearing a suit, and I had on  this brand new Kiss shirt I had just bought.  It said Merry Kissmas.  It said Merry Kissmas.  Oh, no, it didn't.  Yes, it did, and it's Kiss fucking standing there holding, like, candles.  I might even have it on my camera.  Oh, it's fucking that horrid.  It said Merry Kissmas, and I was so ashamed, I couldn't, uh... 
[03:43:30]  Did you just walk out?  Yeah, and she's like, who cares?  And I'm like, let's just do this another time.  Merry Kissmas.  All right, granted, it's silly.  You are a big fan.  By the way, as he tries to find the picture, I want to make sure this is read the right  way.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Today I learned Ralphie May thinks Suge Knight is a pussy with a glass jaw.  That's right.  Ralphie May said that.  Probably not a wise thing to say.  Yeah.  Puma said it.  Oh, no.  I don't...  I'm reporting.  You don't have it?  I'm very sad. 
[03:44:00]  All right, should we get out of here?  Merry Kissmas.  All right.  Yep.  I mean, we could...  Let's roll.  We could go to the phones, but maybe we shouldn't.  Yeah.  Maybe we should just say goodbye.  Yeah, you know, people are commenting.  Well, we got a meeting.  Look, they're all waiting to talk to us out there.  All right, line of the day.  All right.  Line of the day is brought to you by Bodogfight.com.

Here's the runner-up line of the day.  I'm having my ass eaten on my hands and knees just kind of humping into her mouth.  Oh, God.  That was like a dog.  It was awful.  Jimmy!  I was rubbing my dog pussy on the carpet.  Jimmy!  Oops.  That was a good one. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  That was the second scooting joke of the show for me.  I cannot get enough of that FedEx truck plowing into that police car.  It's a great video of the day.  Wow.  Video of the day.  Video of the day.  What about line?  Oh, there it is.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  And I was, my asshole, I fucking, like all those tarot chips that they served on JetBlue, 
[03:45:30]  I felt like someone rubbed them against my fucking ass crack.  You ever have salt and vinegar potato chip, asshole?  Where it's raw and tender?  You get a chaplain walk so your cheeks don't rub together?  Yeah.  Chaplain walk.  Boy, you picked a great day to see Jimmy work.  How's it going?  You're getting a thumbs up out there, Jimmy. 
[03:46:00]  All right.  All right.  Let's leave it right where it sits.  Ralphie May, thank you.  Thank you for having me.  You're at Bananas in Hasbrook Heights.  And Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie on Friday, Hasbrook Heights on Saturday.  Bananas.  Poughkeepsie.  But I'll be in.  Check your local listings to find out where Ralphie's going to be.  And Jimmy.  Tonight, tomorrow through Sunday.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  The Italian Villa.  It's 717-397-4973.  And I'll be there with my, you know, my jokes. 
[03:46:30]  Yes.  This guy is begging us to take his phone call.  He used the instant feedback to tell us that he's on hold for 45 minutes.  Aaron, Detroit, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Guys rock.  I learned today.  I realized today I'd rather go toe-to-toe with that Spartan dude from the movie 300 than have my asshole anywhere near that crazy nigger, Tyson.  That could be, it's not only the worst call someone has made in a year, it's probably the fucking most unfunny, uninteresting thought anyone has had in a year. 
[03:47:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Yes.  45 minutes from that, huh?  Yep.  And instant feedback.  All right.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Thank you to Jimmy's girlfriend for giving us a nice lift at the end of the show.  Yeah.  Getting rave reviews on the phone lines.  Yes.  Rave.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They want to hear a lot more.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Are they calling me a pussy?  Strashing me? 
[03:47:30]  Show that to Jimmy.  Okay.  What's that?  Nothing bad, girlfriend.  Nothing bad.  Aunt reading Jim's card.  Oh.  420?  What, did he read it in Greek?  Oh, 120.  All right.  Well, you better get a microphone out there then, because you just...  It's adorable.  Who wouldn't want to get a Valentine's Day card like this, except for, like, another man? 
[03:48:00]  I just wanted to go to brunch.  I knew there was a trick here.  No, it was...  It's a trick.  Next door, good brunch.  Yeah.  Yeah, hey.  We should have done a thing.  We didn't know.  A thing.  No, I can't go there, since he said it.  Why?  I'll go to hell.  Can I get mobbed?  We should have done a thing, though.  Why aren't we doing a thing?  I'm ready to do a thing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  If my girlfriend's listening, we're going to do a thing.  Yeah, you know, be the place. 
[03:48:30]  We cut to her fast asleep.  That'd be hysterical on the pillow, drooling, just kind of...  Well, we just want to play this.  It's quick.  All right.  Can I read it aloud?  Let me read Jimmy's card.  The dog with a little rose in the mouth.  You don't mind if we read it out loud?  No, no, no.  She's in bed.  Okay.  She's in bed.  Happy Valentine's Day, baby.  I got nervous.  Yeah.  I'm about to write an M, but an M slipped out.  Yeah.  It says Valentine's.  If I had to count all of the ways I love you, it would add up to a whole bunch of reasons. 
[03:49:00]  I realize that girlfriends don't get grades, but if they did, you would get an A+.  We fuss and quarrel and quibble, and I wish we would do so on a lesser level.  There isn't even a scale that could weigh how much I love you, but I wish there was because 
[03:49:30]  it would be very heavy.  You know, I skimmed this.  I took it.  Oh, my God, it was just a sweet card.  I really did.  This is the first time she's actually hearing it.  Oh, there's jokes in there.  You need cards on tape from Jimmy.  What do you do?  Just look and ink too much?  I was like, oh, that's sweet, baby.  Thanks.  She didn't read it.  All right.  Here's the rest of it. 
[03:50:00]  We should be boyfriend and girlfriend for a long time.  If we broke up, I would cry rivers and lakes and oceans of tears.  Our relationship should blossom and grow like a big plant.  You're so cute when you beg for it.  And then Jimmy wrote, what is it?  LOL.  Well, and then happy Valentine's Day, and he put an arrow at Valentine's, maybe the N? 
[03:50:30]  No, no.  The Valentine's, it was just where the whole sentiment up the top.  Oh, happy Valentine's Day.  He just put an arrow and put ha ha.  You just skimmed it.  There's nothing wrong with that, right?  That's so funny.  Sometimes when you're reading a card from somebody, you're so fixated on what expression you should  have.  And like, if the person's watching you, read it.  So you're not really paying attention to the card.  And how long it's taking to read. 
[03:51:00]  Like, sometimes I'll be reading it, and those big, long, Hallmark things, I'm reading and  reading and reading.  And then I'm going, I'm looking stupid because it's taking me too long to read.  So I'm not going to read the rest.  And then you skip to the bottom line, and then go, that's a nice card.  Well, I didn't, no, I didn't see her read it.  She read it on the bowl.  So I didn't get a chance to watch her.  She just, she's in the room.  I didn't.  Read it on the bowl.  The fucking paper flew out, and the fucking, took the card in.  Is that true? 
[03:51:30]  I can't remember.  No, you were on the sofa.  I was in my room, putting away my underpants.  Going through your receipts.  Holding my underpants.  Going through your receipts, right.  God damn, you two are hysterical.  Fucking Continental.  Continental.com, sons of bitches.  I'm so, I, Continental robbed me.  Plus to get free on flights.  And you were one of their biggest fans.  Oh, no.  You were, dude.  We all joined Continental because of you.  The only one that got me.  I never would have given a shit when I fly, and now it's only Continental.  It ain't no better anywhere else. 
[03:52:00]  Last night, actually four hours, we spent online trying to redeem some of our AA Advantage points.  And they're sons of bitches.  They're rad bastards.  The AA Advantage site doesn't work.  You can't redeem, you know, shit through it.  They all suck.  They're designed for you not to use it.  You got to buy the balls now.  I'm going to get, I will get them on, on Monday, I have to have a mileage add up and see how  many miles they robbed me for, but I'm going to deal with them on Monday.  I'm so, oh yeah, I'm just disgusted. 
[03:52:30]  On Monday, I deal with United, American, Continental, the Tatalias, Bazzini.  Just awful.  I've never felt so raped by a company.  Yeah.  I really do.  I feel like I just woke up, I have to sit in a warm tub and huddle, just looking at  the Continental emblem on my bathroom door.  All right, should we leave?  I'm out.  Yeah, we'll go to brunch.  I'm out.  Aw.  I see the look you guys are giving each other. 
[03:53:00]  Let's get out of here.  Thank you, Ralphie.  See you, Adam.  Hey, man, my pleasure.  We'll see you Monday, all right?  All right, guys.  Have fun in Lancaster.  Bye.  These guys, they can do whatever they want to do.  This is why people are tuning in to hear Opie and Anthony.  And this is where things get riddick, riddick, riddick, riddick, riddick.  I need to be a shark, dog.  Always up to no good.  Be a man.  I laughed so hard, I had to buckle myself out of my couch.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And this is, like, the number one show in the world.
