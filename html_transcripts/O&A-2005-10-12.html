<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' characteristically crude and vulgar banter, including offensive jokes about rape and defecation. They transitioned into a discussion of the weather, launching their "Whip 'em Out Wednesday" segment, encouraging female listeners to flash their breasts upon seeing a "WOW" sticker on a car.  This led to a conversation about their assistant and the awkwardness of delegating tasks. A caller suggested "Super Duper Doppler" as a name for their weather Doppler, which the hosts adopted.  They criticized excessive live shots in news reporting unless an emergency was unfolding, and established a "WOW" hotline for reporting sightings from the aforementioned segment.  The hosts debated the supposed luck (or lack thereof) associated with seeing exposed breasts.

A caller, Allie, a former "Sexiest State" contestant, called in to recount breaking up with her boyfriend due to his sexual encounters with a young boy in Thailand. The ensuing conversation was highly sexually explicit, featuring graphic descriptions of sexual acts and preferences, with the hosts actively participating in the sexually charged banter and a failed attempt to have Allie simulate the use of a vibrator on air.

The show then shifted to a New York Post headline, "Priest Made Me Gay," prompting a discussion about a lawsuit against the Catholic Church alleging that childhood molestation caused the plaintiff's homosexuality.  The hosts debated the plausibility of the claim and the lawsuit's motivations.  They briefly touched upon other news stories, including clowns entertaining prisoners in Massachusetts and an unreliable Iraqi informant ("O4") whose tip increased NYC subway security. The segment concluded with more vulgar banter and promotion of the "WOW" stickers.

The next segment began with a discussion surrounding a NYC subway terror threat based on an informant's questionable lie detector test results. This led to speculation about interrogation techniques and the informant's credibility.  The conversation then abruptly changed to the New York Yankees' World Series loss, blaming Steinbrenner, Cashman, and Lupica.  A listener called about a schoolteacher suspended for molesting a 13-year-old boy, prompting cynical commentary on media bias in covering such stories, particularly regarding race and geographic location.  They briefly mentioned bird flu before a commercial break.

Post-break, the hosts promoted their upcoming appearance at the Javits Center Digital Life Show. A substantial portion focused on listener-submitted restaurant names and menu items for Opie's new establishment, many of which were crude and offensive.  They then discussed a Christian sitcom and a G-Rock radio station promotional stunt involving Brian and Jen staying in bed until raising $50,000 for breast cancer awareness.  The hosts extensively critiqued the G-Rock stunt and their on-air style, interspersed with listener calls offering further commentary on both the sitcom and the stunt.  No guests besides the hosts and callers were present during these segments.

The following segment started with discussions about a weather-damaged tent at a Rockaway Bedding breast cancer charity event and subsequent listener calls expressing concern.  They mocked the "Wiggy Morning Show" featuring Brian and Jen, imitating their style.  A large portion focused on excerpts from the book "Everything You Know About Sex Is Wrong," featuring explicit and bizarre passages. This led to discussions about unconventional sexual practices and terminology. An interview with author Russ Kick was attempted but repeatedly interrupted by a disruptive female co-host ("Betsy") and prank calls, including one referencing Kick's supposed connection to child abuse and AIDS.  The segment ended with further discussion of the book and more interruptions.  The hosts briefly mentioned their upcoming Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe (featuring a U2 tribute band) and a contest involving listener-submitted photos of their bowel movements.

A later segment featured a brief appearance by Russ, the author of "Sex is Wrong," followed by a lengthy in-studio appearance by comedian Jim Norton. Norton’s stand-up routine covered dating struggles, self-image issues, and acting experiences, with self-deprecating humor about his appearance and discomfort around women. He also mentioned his role in "Lucky Louie."  The show then discussed Mark Foxx, a religious performer who also created children’s music as "Little Marky," playing audio clips of his unusual performances with disturbing lyrics involving death and sacrifice.  The hosts and a caller speculated about Foxx's current whereabouts and persona. The broadcast concluded with an extended discussion about the avian flu, using news reports and a caller’s scientific input, interspersed with humorous and crude commentary about the news coverage, pandemic potential, and fear-mongering.  The segment was filled with sexually explicit and offensive jokes.

[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you're stinky.  You are cordially invited  to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  If you have any poo, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  Oh, my God.  Hello, exactly.  I'm scared.  a little girl.  Laura said.  See you.  Here we go.  You can just do it.  She was banging cocktail wings two at a time.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had them all over the world. 
[00:05:00]  Shut up!  Hello? Hello?  This thing on? Hello?  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along for the ride.  Shut up!  Beyond AM, Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Shut up!  Mom! I'm not going to have to do this now. 
[00:05:30]  Mom, please stop calling me.  Time to broadcast.  No more palaver.  What is our Doppler called, Anthony?  Right now we're looking at the Doppler, what, CNN's Doppler? I don't know.  No, our Doppler.  Oh, the one for this show? 
[00:06:00]  We need our own Doppler.  The MF 4000 is the motherfucker Doppler.  Nice, I like that.  Who beats that?  I like that.  Well, it's raining here in New York City, but it's sunny somewhere, I'm sure.  Of course it is.  Let's whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah, not here.  Not today.  No.  Roll up your windows Wednesday here.  See what it is. 
[00:06:30]  Unless you mean your umbrella.  Whip it out Wednesday.  The boob index.  Cover a friend.  If you're walking down the sidewalk, too.  Cover a friend.  A stranger, maybe.  If you have a big golf umbrella.  With the umbrella?  Sure.  Why let them get wet?  Oh, yeah, that's exactly what we do here in New York.  Selfish bastards we all are.  Selfish bastards aren't trying to poke your eyes out as they keep dry.  Didn't you feel important this morning?  Walking in, I saw you.  I pulled up the vehicle.  That was nice, actually.  Master Poe jumps out of his vehicle, umbrella in hand, and puts it over Opie's head for the walk into the building. 
[00:07:00]  Then I get out of my vehicle, because, of course, I can't walk from the garage to the studio when it's raining like this.  I'm a fancy gentleman, and I don't need raindrops falling on my head.  So, I park the vehicle.  I call up.  Hello, Steve.  Only man I trust with my vehicle.  Could you please pull my car around? 
[00:07:30]  At your leisure and convenience, Paul will have the keys.  I understand you're editing stuff for the program, but whenever you can, please come down and bring my car to the garage, please.  Thank you, sir.  And then Poe gets the umbrella over my head right into the building.  I'm feeling like what they call a big shot.  That felt very awkward.  It did.  Wasn't it weird?  I felt really awkward.  I just forgot my umbrella.  I didn't think it was going to rain that hard.  I just had to be a little too close to Poe is what it was. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, that's a little weird.  Like I say good morning to Poe every morning.  You know, you walk in the building, but I'm not like shoulder to shoulder with him for the walk to the door.  A little awkward.  I just don't like needing him.  I just don't like needing him.  Yeah.  I get all uncomfortable.  Yeah.  And then I have to thank him.  It's a whole thing.  Thank you for perhaps saving your life.  There you go.  But it's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  The boob index in New York City is at a dreary one.  Oh, yeah.  It's a dreary one. 
[00:08:30]  If you're in the New York area, good luck seeing boobs today.  But it's a 10 out there somewhere in this country.  That's why.  Sheeping up to a 10.  That's why we love doing this national talk show.  Because somewhere, somebody is seeing boobs thanks to this program.  All you need to do is get a WOW sticker.  And you're set.  You're ready to go.  You throw it on the back of your vehicle.  If you can't get a WOW sticker, make a homemade one or ride it in the dirt.  And then ladies.  There's a lot of ladies out there.  And I'm talking to some of the ladies right now. 
[00:09:00]  If you see the WOW and you're feeling a little, what's the word, Anthony?  A little naughty?  No.  A little adventurous?  No.  A little slutty?  No.  No.  What?  What is the word?  A little outgoing?  No.  No.  A little rambunctious?  What word would you use wanting to expose yourself? 
[00:09:30]  Hot.  It's the opposite of voyeuristic, which is looking.  Exhibitionist.  If you're feeling a bit exhibitionist.  I'm going to go with the word flirty.  Flirty?  That's flirty?  I think batting your eyes at the vehicle next to you is flirty.  No one bats their eyes anymore.  No?  That was something they did in, I don't know, the olden days.  When they said, hubba hubba, she's batting her eyes at me.  No one bats their eyes anymore.  That went away. 
[00:10:00]  You had to turn down your old Delco AM radio so you could yell something to her as she batted  her eyes at you?  Her big doe eyes?  Flirty.  All right.  Well, the ladies are out there, and they do want to show their boobs.  It's been working great for us for many years.  So, ladies, if you see the wow, that's what that means, okay?  Whip them out Wednesday or whip them out whenever.  And you can get your official O.P. and Anthony wow stickers by just sending in a self-addressed  stamped envelope to us here in New York City, and we'll get the wow stickers out to you, 
[00:10:30]  okay?  Bill the intern just works his ass off getting those stickers out.  I think we got a handle on the whole wow thing, finally.  All right.  How about the Monster Rain Doppler 69?  I like that.  Someone wants to call it the, well, listen to this one, HD from Ohio.  HD.  What's up?  What's up?  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, fella.  I got a name for your Doppler.  Okay.  Super Duper Doppler. 
[00:11:00]  Well, that's the best Doppler you could ever have, because it is indeed Super Duper.  I like the Super Duper Doppler.  You know what?  That isn't even out of the realm of possibility for a news station to go to the Super Duper Doppler,  those assheads.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Lame, phony names.  All we know is the weather guys here in New York City, very excited to come to work today,  because they got something to talk about, finally.  Oh, the rain, yeah.  They sent some woman out, like, 40 miles out onto Long Island with a truck and everything, 
[00:11:30]  just to stand there in the rain with an umbrella saying it's raining out here on Long Island.  Yeah, I don't get that.  I don't get how they could just send their resources out for weather, like it's just rain.  I don't get the live shots anymore.  No.  Like, there's a story on, let's say, the New York Jets, so at 5, 6 in the morning,  all of a sudden there's a reporter doing the report about the Jets outside the stadium.  Yeah.  What is that about?  Who cares?  The only reason for a live shot would be we're here outside the bank, there's hostages inside with a gunman, 
[00:12:00]  they're trying to talk him out, because you never know what's going to happen.  That's the time.  Two homosexuals inside the bank, I'm not homosexual.  WNW plays all the hits.  Yeah, that's like you would want to be there because something might happen.  Right.  There's no reason to be there if it's the location where something did happen or nothing's going to happen.  But they send the trucks and everything.  Thank God, because it helps us with our assault on the media. 
[00:12:30]  Of course.  But I really see no reason for it.  All right.  And really fast, we now have the wow line for wow sightings.  Oh, thank God that's up and running.  How is that working?  So far, so good.  Yeah, so far, so good.  It's 1-866-WOW-ME-05 we came up with.  866-WOW-ME-05 if you're seeing boobs out there on the highways and the byways and the side streets.  Or maybe you're just in your driveway pulling out and you're that lucky.  Do you think anyone's that lucky? 
[00:13:00]  They got the wow in their car and all of a sudden they're just pulling out of the driveway?  Out of the driveway?  We hear the story.  Some people, I'm not going to lie to you, they go a year or two without seeing the boobs.  It's like fishing, we've always said.  Yeah, after they throw the wow sticker on their car.  Do you think there's people out there that are so lucky they're just pulling out of their driveway and they're getting wowed?  Oh, wow!  And just tits flying the whole way to work.  Gets like five just on his commute to work.  But you know how that ends, right?  Lucky guy.  That guy never gets to see boobs again.  No.  It's like one and done. 
[00:13:30]  I think it's that he just...  You get the beginner's luck and then forget it.  I think it's probably the fact that he's probably the type of guy the girls just would flash their boobs at anyway.  You think?  Yeah.  All right.  So that's what we got going on.  Let's whip him out Wednesday.  Hey, we should get some of the...  You know the restaurant you're opening up with your brother?  In Huntington?  Yes.  Yeah, we should get some of the names that people are coming up with for that goddamn thing because I was cracking up.  Well, get someone on it.  Chester's.  It's on Wack Bag?  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  Did you see Chester's Prime Rib House?  No.  And the logo is you kicking Chester.  And they serve prime rib and baked potatoes.  Like these assheads are just putting together these restaurants for you.  All right.  Well, someone's got to get the better names and we'll share it with everybody else.  And then one person, because it's in Photoshop, some of them have pictures of the restaurant with the sign out front.  And you know how some restaurants put their menu out on a little sandwich board? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, of course.  It said, menu, bring your own food.  Like your house instead of bring your own wine.  Bring your own food.  We'll have the tables and chairs for you and we'll throw in the silverware.  You just come in and eat your lunch.  Another guy on the windows of this restaurant, I forgot what the name was, but he had painted in yellow paint,  appearing every Friday, Opie from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:15:00]  I think you're doing an appearance every weekend there.  I probably will, you know.  All right.  I'll be at the grand opening.  Whenever that is.  Whenever it is.  Oh, my brother's tearing the whole place apart, so.  Is he?  Yeah, we're hoping to open up by, I don't know, November 1st, I guess.  Is he a prick to work for?  You think he'll be like, like, crack the whip, iron fist?  No, he's cool.  Yeah?  He's not like me.  He's really cool.  No, because I know, like, restaurant.  I know restaurant people have to really crack the whip, you know, like the guy in charge. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  It's kind of like, I worked at a few restaurants.  It's, oh, it's.  No, he's got people calling him.  Unforgiving.  Really.  He's been in the business so long, he's got a lot of people calling him.  They all want to work for him.  Please, can I come and cook for you?  Go fuck yourself.  So, let's say hi to Sean.  South, I guess South Dakota, right?  Yeah.  Oh, I love your state.  What's up, Sean?  Hey, just wanted to tell you guys I like the show and happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, man.  Hey, yeah, the local big story in the state over here is a double-A football team is traveling 
[00:16:00]  across the state on an activity bus.  It's like a 300-mile trip.  And apparently the girl in the back of the bus was paid to service seven players while the  coaches slept in the front of the bus.  Now, who arranged the chicks?  I don't know exactly.  The details haven't come out yet, but they're trying to decide on what county it happened 
[00:16:30]  in so they can press charges.  What's wrong with that?  Who told?  Yeah, who's the rat?  Wait, it's a high school girl that just decided to do this?  Well, yeah.  The cheerleaders and some of the other, I don't know, just fans, I guess, were riding on  the bus.  The booster bus that follows.  Usually there's a booster bus that follows, Opie.  Somebody got boosted.  Yeah.  But seven players were kicked off the team, and apparently some rat in the back had a picture 
[00:17:00]  cell phone.  Oh, those picture cell phones are ruining everything.  They really are.  Who would rat everybody out for getting blown on a bus?  What's wrong with people?  Oh, God.  The one guy that didn't get blown?  Yeah.  It's always the one guy that didn't get blown sitting there, the nerdy guy.  The water boy.  The water boy.  Yeah, when I was playing basketball, after the games and stuff, everyone was hooking up 
[00:17:30]  like crazy, man.  The cheerleaders would sneak onto the team bus and just pair off with players, and then it  would just be a whole make-out session back to the high school.  Don't you understand?  But I didn't see any BJs going on.  If you're going to blow some of the football team, you've got to blow everyone on the bus,  or else somebody's going to rat.  But if you're sitting there watching that, and you're not getting any, you're going to  be pissed.  I think you'd chuckle a little bit, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, you're laughing a little.  That shit, no, I don't know. 
[00:18:00]  I think you'd rat.  You'd get all pissed off.  You're the guy that would rat?  If I'm not getting any?  Dude, I wasn't going to...  Rat in a second.  I wasn't getting blown in high school.  I'm not the guy ratting out.  Were you sitting on a bus while everyone else was?  Look, man.  No, you've got to.  That chick's got to leave the bus looking like a Play-Doh Fun Factory, or nothing.  You're the guy that's going to rat everyone out, because you're not getting a BJ.  Yeah.  She better suck it, or else everyone's going down.  It was pretty sad.  Like, there would be make-out sessions all around me on the team bus, and I'd be listening 
[00:18:30]  to my Dr. Domeno tapes.  Ooh.  Hello, mother.  Hello, father.  I used to love Dr. Domeno.  Is he the one that sang Camp Granada?  Oh, that's the song?  Well, he didn't sing it, but he played it on his show.  Yeah.  Like, Dr. Domeno had the best career ever.  Ever.  He just played goof songs every week.  He played other people's goof songs.  Didn't have to write them or make them or anything.  I think he's...  He was, like, our influence. 
[00:19:00]  He sang a few here and there, but, yeah, you're right.  Yeah, it was pretty much just, you know, play other people's goofy songs, and he would  get credit for them a lot of the time.  Right.  Yeah.  The Funny Five or whatever it was called.  Yeah.  At the end of the show.  All righty.  All right.  Thanks for the story.  All right.  Camp Granada wasn't a funny song.  Hello, mother.  Well, a lot of them weren't...  Camp Granada.  A lot of them weren't funny songs.  They were just goofy, different songs.  You know, part's really funny about that song. 
[00:19:30]  They say camp is very entertaining.  They say we'll go outside if it stops raining.  Because he's stuck inside now, not having fun.  Indoors.  Oh, we have it.  Of course we do.  What channel would they play this on?  XM what?  Kids, probably.  Kids?  Yeah.  Laugh USA, the comedy channel without any curses.  Hello, mother.  Hello, father.  They're laughing already.  Here I am at Camp Granada. 
[00:20:00]  Camp is very entertaining.  And they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining.  I went hiking with Joe Spivey.  Spivey.  He developed...  Poison Ivy?  Poison Ivy.  You remember Leonard Skinner.  When that was Julie taped her, we all held her down and we raped her.  All the counselors hate the waiters and the lake has alligators. 
[00:20:30]  And the head coach wants no sissies.  So he reads to us from something called Ulysses.  Why is that funny?  It's not.  This should scare you.  But my bunkmate has malaria.  Scare you malaria?  Who's a bunkmate?  Jeffrey Hardy.  I thought he said buttmate.  I swear to God.  They're about to organize a searching party. 
[00:21:00]  Take me home.  Oh, mother father.  Take me home.  They are just laughing at us.  They're pumping nitrous into this place.  Leave me out in the forest where I might get eaten by a bear.  Take me home.  I promise I will not make noise or mess the house with other boys. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, please don't make me stay.  This is horrid.  I've been here one whole day.  Oh, there's the joke.  It's only a day.  Dearest father.  Oh, go figure.  This is who they got me rooming up with?  A smelly.  Hey, who sings this?  Let me come home.  If you miss me.  I would even let Amford the Harkin kiss me.  Wait a minute.  A bigger brother. 
[00:22:00]  You know I'm not.  Guys are sailing.  Playing baseball.  Gee, that's better.  Mother father.  Kindly disregard this letter.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Hey.  What's that guy's name?  Who sang that?  Alan Sherman.  Alan Sherman.  Alan Sherman.  Yikes.  He's a hoot.  He had a hell of a career.  Very good.  All right, we got an update.  Remember Allie?  She did the sexiest state. 
[00:22:30]  A bit we haven't done in a very long time.  Allie.  When we first started on XM, we were trying to find the sexiest state in America.  So basically we had couples call up every morning and fuck live on the show.  Yeah.  We haven't done one in a very long time.  Well, Allie was part of a team that was the sexiest state in America for a while.  Right.  From California.  What part of California, Allie?  The Bay Area.  The Bay Area.  Do we have an actual, we have actual audio of you guys winning sexiest state, right? 
[00:23:00]  Oh, it's 15 minutes long?  Never mind.  Can we get a clip of it maybe?  You know, where they're really just going at it.  All right.  Allie, you got an update?  Yeah.  I actually broke up with my boyfriend who was having sex with us at the time.  You broke up with the guy that you won sexiest state?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I found out some information about him.  What did you find out? 
[00:23:30]  Well, you know how you guys were talking about Thailand and whoever would go there only wants  to have sex with a 12-year-old boy?  Young boys, yes.  Yeah.  Well, he actually loved Thailand.  He went there before we started dating.  Oh, boy.  And then he went there when we were dating.  And apparently he had sex with someone who he thought was a girl but then later found  out that it was a very young boy.  Lucky guy. 
[00:24:00]  Lucky guy.  Hey, you get one for free.  Apparently so.  So, uh...  Well, how old was this person?  How old was this person?  I'm sorry?  How old was the person?  The boy slash girl?  Yeah, whatever.  Uh, I don't know.  12, 13, something young.  Oh.  All right.  So how'd you find out?  Um, he, uh, told my, uh, best friend's boyfriend.  And, uh, he, um, told me. 
[00:24:30]  How do you break that to your best...  Why would he tell him?  Yeah, why wouldn't you...  Why wouldn't you just keep that to yourself?  I don't know.  He was drunk when he told him.  Guys don't high-five over that dude.  Fucking 12-year-old.  But it was a boy!  Give me some skin.  Up top, yo!  Well, apparently it was what he wanted, so, you know.  So where's he now?  Um, I don't know.  Dating some chick, whatever, whatever.  And he go...  How often does he go to Thailand? 
[00:25:00]  Um, he wanted to go back.  I don't know if he's going to, but he wants to go to Turkey or Hungary or...  Jesus!  Yeah, they're pinned under boulders there.  He's just pulling a little pants down.  Hear a little muffled.  Boop!  This guy doesn't want to work at all.  Little mocha-colored legs just kicking.  They're hot. 
[00:25:30]  What can I say?  Are you banging other guys at this point?  Um, yes I am, actually.  Hey, good girl.  So you're not that bummed, are you?  Um, no, not anymore.  He was kind of an asshole, so what can you do?  Yeah.  But, I mean...  Maybe you were too needy and he wanted to really just make sure he broke the ties.  No, well...  Yeah.  No, I'm not...  Yeah, maybe, like, that's a great way to break up.  She ain't coming back. 
[00:26:00]  You ain't coming back when you find out that crap.  I have sex with a 12-year-old boy.  Right, but if he said, ah, I cheated on you with a hot 20-year-old blonde from the local  bar...  Yeah.  After a while, you might want to fight your way back into the relationship.  Right.  Who knows?  I don't know.  Well, when he was drunk, he used to tell me that he, um, had a craving to suck dick.  Wow, this guy's a real winner, man.  Yeah, no kidding.  This guy's a keeper.  Oh, yeah, definitely. 
[00:26:30]  And I would always pretend that he never said it, you know, and he never brought it up.  La, la, la, I am not listening to you.  Did you do that?  Plug your ears.  Wait, so you guys got really hammered once, and then he just, like, decided that, uh,  you would understand?  Yeah, basically, and he never said it again, you know, so...  Well, walk us through it.  You guys got drunk, and then what?  And then, you know, he said that, um, he thought that everyone was basically bi, and he said that  he wanted to, um, suck dick, and that he thought he'd be really good at it, and I basically 
[00:27:00]  changed the subject right away, you know?  You know what works in that case?  You should have just went, oh, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep,  I should have, huh?  When did he realize that he probably shouldn't have said that to you?  Um, I don't, it was like, it was pretty far into the relationship where he thought that  he could, you know, really trust me.  I think he woke up hungover, but remembered he said that, and was like, oh, God. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, yeah, maybe she...  Oh, did I say something stupid last night?  Maybe she won't remember.  Oh, God, maybe she won't remember.  I know, well, and I didn't bring it up to him, because I was like, fuck, I hope he didn't  really mean it, you know?  Yeah, just drunk talk.  Yeah.  Yeah, but then he brought it up again, like, a couple months later, so...  Yeah.  How'd he bring it up again?  He said, he's like, oh, well, you know, remember what I said before, and that's something that  I really want to do before I get married, and blah, blah, blah, and I was just like, 
[00:28:00]  uh, okay, we're definitely never getting married at all.  Yeah, well, I'm sorry to hear that, Allie, but it sounds like you're doing okay.  What gave him away?  You went to get something out of the closet, and you saw 30 robes?  Yeah, no, I don't know.  He was an interesting one, but I totally, I mean, the thing is, is that, you know, if  a guy's an asshole, I totally appreciate that, but just be up front about it, you know? 
[00:28:30]  Well, that's not really an asshole.  An asshole would be some guy that, like, doesn't pay attention to you, slap you around.  This guy is a pervert.  Yes.  Like, he's kind of a sicko, if I may be so bold.  He's, uh, he's, uh, he's, uh, he's, uh, gay.  Yeah, with a little bit of the gay thrown in.  He's got a little, uh, gay.  I think an asshole is more something that he'd love to receive a penis into.  All right, Allie, well, thanks for the update.  I don't know what to tell you.  All right, well, thank you so much. 
[00:29:00]  I love you guys.  You guys are so great.  Oh, thank you.  And, uh, I love your, uh, honesty, and you, you're really hot.  You apparently don't love honesty.  Look what happened to the last fellow that told you the truth.  Just tries to be a little honest with you.  I want to suck dick, and I think I'd be good at it, for Pete's sake.  Where are you going?  Like 12-year-old boys.  You know, whatever.  Whatever worked for you, I guess.  I don't know.  And can I tell you a secret?  Yeah.  Allie, you've told me that.  I don't think that he thought it was a girl.  I think he knew it was a little boy, and he was trying to feel out the other guy. 
[00:29:30]  Because if you go there, you go in there for a weird reason.  That's different than, you know, making a tranny error.  When you're talking about you want to suck dick, and then you wind up banging a 12-year-old boy.  It just doesn't happen like that.  You don't bang a kid by accident.  I know.  I think so, too.  I think he, uh, wanted to do it, and, uh, just tried it out and see what it was like, but.  All right.  All right, Allie.  All right, well, thank you so much.  We'd all hug you if you were here to help you out through your crisis, but, uh, you're  far away, so.  Yep, we'll have to hug each other.  I'll come visit on your, uh, lesbian couch. 
[00:30:00]  Do you still have that?  Uh, we have the lesbian liberator.  Yes.  From the fine folks from the liberator company.  Liberator?  Yeah.  Oh.  That's those sex couches you see in the back of magazines.  Right, right.  We have one in the studio, and it's gotten quite a workout in the first year of our, uh,  our, uh, stint here at XM Satellite Radio.  Well, maybe I'll have to, um, come try that out.  All right.  Allie, good luck, sis. 
[00:30:30]  Thank you so much.  You're going to be losing a lot of weight soon.  You know that, right?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, God knows, God knows what he caught while he was doing that and still doing you.  Do you think that he hadn't been out blowing guys?  He was doing it, and he finally was just trying to tell you when he told you that.  Right.  I know.  Well, I, I, as soon as I found out, you know, I went and, uh, checked myself out to make  sure that I was okay.  Well, you might want to check in another year.  Yeah, no kidding, huh?  All right.  Nah, you'll be fine, Allie.  We're just messing with you.  All right.  All right. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  Well, have a good night.  All right.  Keep in touch.  Oh, that's right.  It's very early in the morning for you over there.  It certainly is.  Oh, do you want to, like, uh, I don't know, play with your vibrator or something today?  Uh-huh.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, I do.  Guys, would you like to hear Allie play with her vibrator?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Where is the, uh, vibrator?  Um, well, it's actually in, um, my other room.  All right.  Go get it.  Okay.  Hang on.  I just got to take one phone call and go get it. 
[00:31:30]  Uh, let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Yeah, welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you, man.  728.  Rogue joke.  Check.  Very good.  728.  Robe joke.  Check.  That's very funny.  All right.  Allie.  Hi.  You still there?  Yeah, I am.  So what do you look like again?  It's been a while.  Um, well, I have blonde hair and blue eyes, and I'm 5'4 and 3 quarters, and, uh, I have 
[00:32:00]  by C cups, I guess, and, um, I don't know.  What else?  Um, a lot more there, Allie.  You know, it's bad news when they, when they spend too much time on the eyes and, and the  hair color.  Yeah.  Shoulder length.  I'm 107.  Oh, good.  Okay.  This isn't the couple you hung with, is it?  No.  What was that?  Did you hang with Jim Norton once? 
[00:32:30]  No, I never, I never.  All right.  There was a couple Jim Norton hung with, and a lot of people are asking if, uh, you're the  one.  No, Adam and, um, I can't, I can't remember the girl's name.  I can't believe it.  They were really nice.  She's had a baby.  But you remember the guy's name.  That's great.  Well, no, he had to chat with him online.  It's kind of homoish, but, Ariel, Adam and Ariel.  You walked right into the, I really did.  There was Adam, and then, uh, then there was, uh, yeah.  I didn't walk into it, I skipped into it with my mouth open. 
[00:33:00]  All right, Allie, what do you got for us today?  Um, well, I.  Are you naked in your room there?  Yes, I am.  Oh, all right.  And, uh, I'm starting my vibrator right now.  Let's hear it against the phone.  All right, hang on a second.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, not hearing it.  Did you hear that?  No.  Nothing at all.  Oh, my God.  You can hear that?  No. 
[00:33:30]  No, not at all.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Right up against the phone.  What's it in your boyfriend's mouth?  No, he's passed out.  All right.  Put it right against the phone.  Make it go brrrr on the phone.  All right, hang on.  Did you hear that?  Holy crap.  I'm going to call shenanigans.  Do you have a vibrator?  A vibrator is supposed to vibrate.  If you put it right against the mouthpiece on your phone, we should hear like brrrr, shouldn't 
[00:34:00]  we?  Yeah, you should.  Do you hear it?  No.  No.  All right, all right.  Well, hang on, hang on.  Oh, my God.  People are losing interest, Allie.  Come on.  All right.  Well, I can do it myself anyway.  All right.  How about you start playing with yourself there?  Okay.  I'm touching myself.  All right.  Feels really nice.  Mm-hmm.  Talk us through it here.  Come on.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:34:30]  So, I have my hand on my pussy.  Mm-hmm.  Is it shaved?  Uh-huh.  All the way.  Completely.  Nice.  Hard blue floor, as you guys call it.  Ooh.  What color is your room?  It's, um, I have a green.  I like green a lot.  Ah.  Yeah, good thing, because your pussy's going to be turning it soon. 
[00:35:00]  Hey.  Shh.  That's really good.  Do you have little thin lips or big ones?  Um...  Does it look like an Asian eye?  No.  Just not that, guys.  Oh.  Oh, God. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, God.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Oh.  Thank you.  Oh.  Oh, God. 
[00:36:00]  Mm.  Mm.  Oh, my God. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, I'm imagining you guys with me.  Oh, all of us, what? 
[00:37:00]  Mm-hmm.  Fuck, get the cracker.  Come on, you guys.  Fuck me, you guys.  You guys.  Kind of takes the whole sexy, intimate thing out of it.  Yeah.  It's not just like, you know, hey, Jimmy, you know?  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah, hey.  It's hey, everybody.  Hey, studio full.  Hey, bus full.  Oh, I'll be.  That's the one I would have went with. 
[00:37:30]  Hey.  Anthony.  There you go.  Very good.  Oh, my God.  And little Jimmy, too.  Anthony's got a big one, because he's Italian.  Hold on.  Could you have tossed me into the mix a little bit?  Please?  Jimmy's just watching.  He's going to rat us out.  Yeah.  Take a picture of my cell phone.  Fuck her.  It's so hard.  She can't even fake it and say it.  You're just hot.  You're slapped me hard. 
[00:38:00]  I'm from behind.  It's just so good.  She's so bad.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Vase.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:38:30]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring,  banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring,  banana phone.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Thank you.  All right.  Is that it?  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  Makes me want to book a flight to Thailand.  Wonderful.  Very good, Allie.  The truckers are loving you today.  Thank you.  When can I come visit you guys?  Well, you might as well email Jim.  I arrange all travel for the Opie and Anthony program.  Jimmy's email is yellowtreats at AOL.com.  People are saying she could have hit comedy gold if she would have yelled out,  Oh, Bill Burr.  Yeah, that would have done it. 
[00:39:30]  Wow.  Oh, Opie, oh, Anthony, oh, Bill Burr.  All right, well, the truckers are loving you today, Allie.  Where do you live in California, Allie?  In the Bay Area.  Oh, by San Francisco, okay.  All right.  Frisco.  All right.  Well, send an email to Jimmy, yellowtreats at AOL.com.  Yellow treats like golden showers?  Exactly like that.  And send pictures that we could throw up on our website for everybody else, okay? 
[00:40:00]  Enjoy.  To enjoy.  All right, Allie.  Very good job today.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Have a good night.  Very good.  All right.  There we go.  Not bad.  We could go to break with Allie doing Sexy Estate with the guy who's now out of the picture.  Wherever he is.  Yeah.  We'll regroup, but we got a really good clip for you guys.  We used to do this Sexy Estate thing.  Who knows?  Maybe we'll bring it back.  You never know.  Yeah.  This could be the start of bringing the bit back, okay?  And when we get back, I challenge America today. 
[00:40:30]  Challenge.  Every once in a while, we like to challenge America.  Yeah.  We all have.  Because only the challenged seem to come forward to accept the challenge.  Well, we can even look online ourselves.  Yeah.  We are looking for the best front page in America today.  We only bring this bit up every once in a while, and we think our New York paper beats  any paper out there today.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  Beat this headline on the front page.  It has to be on the front page of your newspaper today, okay? 
[00:41:00]  And Ben will check some of the websites, so we'll be checking for better headlines  across America today.  No fibbing.  The New York Post today, front page, Priest Made Me Gay.  Yeah, that's in big, bold type.  Beat that, America.  Beat that headline today.  Priest Made Me Gay.  We'll talk about that story.  It's about Rob Halford.  We'll talk about that story and many other things after Ali gets off. 
[00:41:30]  and some messages.  Yeah, bitch.  Fuck it.  That's all sketchy.  Yeah.  I thought they were done, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck you.  You like that?  Here you go.  Do you know what a boob is? 
[00:42:00]  Do you know what a boob is?  I love showing my boots to introverted fat guys.  Whip them out Wednesday. 
[00:42:30]  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on this fine whip.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on this fine whip.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  It sucks in New York.  It's raining, but I'm sure it's nice enough to see boobs.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on this fine whip them out Wednesday.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on this fine whip them out Wednesday. 
[00:43:00]  It sucks in New York.  It's raining, but I'm sure it's nice enough to see boobs somewhere across this fine country  of ours.  And you can always tell when Jimmy Norton's back because Jimmy's not here.  That's right.  He decides to go take a leak a second before we go back on the air.  Yeah, your wow stickers.  Send in a self-addressed stamped envelope.  The address is on our website, opianthony.com, okay?  All right.  Boston Herald, blue ribbon task farce? 
[00:43:30]  Farce.  Task farce.  Instead of task force.  That's their front page today.  The Boston Herald.  That ain't fair.  That's not very good.  Nah, well, we're going to...  Not better than priest made me gay.  That's something out of the Inquirer right there.  Can a priest actually make you gay?  I don't think so.  I don't think you can make...  I don't think you can make someone gay.  A New York socialite has slapped the Catholic Church with a $5 million legal notice claiming  he's gay because a priest molested him at an upstate camp when he was seven years old. 
[00:44:00]  Ooh.  I'd probably be married living in Greenwich with four children in boarding school, said J. David Enright, the fourth.  The fourth.  From the Connecticut Enrights?  The Greenwich Enrights?  No.  Wait, what is IV?  That's not fourth.  Yeah, fourth.  It is, right?  Four.  Okay.  All right.  So he's claiming that he would have... 
[00:44:30]  H in front?  That way you're going?  No, just IV.  There's so many things that hit you.  What he'll need soon.  The story goes, a debonair New York socialite filed a $5 million legal notice against the  Catholic Church yesterday claiming his molestation at age seven at the hands of a young priest  led him to become gay.  Ooh.  The question I asked today, is that possible? 
[00:45:00]  I don't know.  That's the age-old question, isn't it?  Isn't it?  J. David Enright, the fourth.  Or IV.  IV.  He comes from a well-to-do family, Anthony.  He says he was repeatedly sexually abused by the Reverend Joseph Romano while he was at  a camp back in 61 and 62.  Hello, Mono. 
[00:45:30]  I hate to fart on...  Where's that song?  He raised my ass and carries bags from Prada.  Jesus.  Seven-year-old at camp, minding his own business, and he got molested by the priest.  And now he's claiming he's gay, and that's worth $5 million.  Hello, Mono. 
[00:46:00]  Hello, Father.  Here I am at...  Camp Granada.  Camp is very...  Entertaining.  He likes to fuck my mouth while I'm toilet training.  I went hiking with Joe Spivey.  He developed...  HIV!  We all have that one.  He got tolmink poisoning last night after dinner. 
[00:46:30]  All the counselors hate the waiters.  And the lake has...  Alligators.  God damn it.  No, I'm not even working fast enough.  Oh, we can stop it.  Wants no sissies.  Yeah.  Oof.  So he reads to us from something called Ulysses.  Ah, the original song looks funny enough.  Yeah, right?  Stands on its own, doesn't it?  It should scare you.  But my bunkmate...  Has no hair there.  Remember, Jeffrey Hardy. 
[00:47:00]  They're about to organize a searching party.  All the priests use his asshole for a party.  They're going to be home for mother fada.  Old Jeff Hardy.  Face down on a pillow somewhere.  Well, so he was at this camp in 61 and 62.  And he says, I believe that my life would be very different now.  Said Enright 51, dressed in a custom-made English suit and a French-cupped shirt.  I'd probably be married, living in Greenwich with four children in boarding school. 
[00:47:30]  Romano bet my life.  The Upper East Side resident said Romano, then 21, took him behind a cabin after dinner  and evening prayers and engaged in sex.  The molestation was repeated up to seven more times, extending into the following summer.  Jesus.  This guy went back to the camp knowing what was in store for him.  The little faggot signed up for next year.  He's going to get raped after movie time.  All right.  I'll be back in June. 
[00:48:00]  He explained to me that this was a rite of passage, said Enright, who recalls the devastating  abuse every day of his life.  Enright made his mark in New York City as a young ad man.  Blah, blah, blah.  Can I ask why he's suing?  If he was molested and it was so bad, why did it all of a sudden change his whole life?  Like, he gets a dick a few times at camp, and all of a sudden, for the rest of his life,  that's all he wants?  Why does he just thank the church to help him find what he really wants?  It's not their fault that he likes dick.  See, he can't turn them gay.  Exactly. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm trying to think of...  All right.  Brussels sprouts.  Yeah?  I tried them as a kid.  Didn't like it.  Didn't like it.  I'm not eating Brussels sprouts.  Did you shove them up your head?  This guy would...  But I'm just saying, if you're trying something and you don't like it, why would you continue  doing that?  Right.  Like, I hate Brussels sprouts.  I tried it.  Didn't like it.  He would have...  Not eating Brussels sprouts.  Valid point. 
[00:49:00]  If it changed his life in a way that, like, he avoided certain things that most people enjoy.  You understand what I mean?  Like, the priest molested me, and now every time I eat a hot dog, I cry.  Or every time I go to eat a cruller, I break out into tears.  Something like that.  But, you know, when you start just head-diving on a dick, well, sorry.  Maybe the priest saw that.  Maybe the priest seeks out the young lads.  Right.  I had a completely straight life in business, he says, noting that he dated women in the  80s.  Then there was the other world, which was slinking around in Greenwich Village gay bars, finding 
[00:49:30]  mates.  Enright, for years, believed he might have been Romano's only victim, but became angry last  month when he learned the 65-year-old retired priest who now lives in Disgrace in Florida  may have molested two other children.  Where's Disgrace?  Is that by Tampa?  Could be the city fucking stupid Bob Kelly's working in, for all you know.  Asshole.  What a dick.  Hey, shithead, if you're going to plug your gigs, it's called Helium! 
[00:50:00]  Stop trying to improv and mention the city name.  Yeah, no city of where that club is.  Dude, I'm working at Helium Comedy Club.  Check your local listings.  Low school.  Let's say hi to Chad in Virginia.  Chad?  Hey, what's up guys?  You guys just made my point perfectly.  If this guy didn't enjoy it, first off, I'll say that I am gay.  And I knew I was gay when I was this guy's age when he was at camp.  But if he didn't enjoy it, he wouldn't be gay.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, you don't keep going back to something that you hated.  I mean, you don't have to do it anymore.  Why do you do it?  He's banging chicks in the 80s, but he can't stop blowing guys in the village?  You can't blame the priest for that.  The other thing is, he could have been stuck in two-town and just got sick of it.  In what?  He could have been stuck in two-town and just got sick of it.  Oh, you're saying a lot of ugly chicks?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've been there.  Watching out.  All right, thank you, Chad.  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, I just want to ask Hopi if he liked marshmallows before he went to college. 
[00:51:00]  Listen, I tried the marshmallows and I didn't like it, so I'm not doing marshmallows anymore.  Do you understand my point, sir?  I'm sure you throw marshmallows in your cocoa, you big pillow nibbler.  You big pillow nibbler.  All right, Joe.  Like you're just going to nibble.  That's what an experienced person does with being relatively as you take a little pillow in your mouth and just go, oh, just nibble.  Just hold it.  I don't take much of a bite anymore.  So there it is. 
[00:51:30]  The front page of our paper today.  Priest made me gay.  Completely ridiculous.  But the guy doesn't need the money, so why is he doing this?  Seems like he's...  Making a point.  Making a point?  Yeah.  And splashing his face all over the papers like this?  Splashing his face.  That's what they call it in the biz.  Splashing your face all over the papers.  So, I don't know.  We're going to see what the other front pages are doing today and see if you can beat that headline.  Priest made me gay. 
[00:52:00]  Priest made me gay.  All right.  Let's say hi to Spanky in Oregon or Oregon.  Spanky, what's up?  Hey, just checking on that clown story you guys had.  You were talking about the Boston one?  Oh, yeah.  We didn't get to that, did we?  No.  All right, I think I got it in front of me here.  Thanks for reminding me, Spanky.  All right, thanks.  All right, bye.  What is Jimmy doing?  Are you laughing at?  What are you laughing at?  I'm trying to figure something out.  Oh, you motherfucker. 
[00:52:30]  That's like a hello, father.  He's rewriting it.  Tell me when you're done, okay?  And then we'll play the song for you.  Someone is suggesting that we get Big A to come in and sing Hello, Mother, Hello, Father.  He's coming in Friday, I believe, to do, like, the best of Jay Leno and Letterman's monologues from the week.  So maybe we could have him sing a song, too.  Hello, Father.  I'm going to sue you.  Got that one?  No, that's funny, though.  I didn't like it when I blew you. 
[00:53:00]  Camp is very entertaining, and now I take real big shits without straining.  Oh, God.  He's suing a priest for molesting him when he was seven, and now he's gay.  He turned gay at age 35, and now he's blaming the priest.  What's up, TJ?  Oh, is this me?  Yeah, what's up? 
[00:53:30]  Hey, what's up?  I wanted to welcome Jimmy back because I had Lampasarge's old buttery nipples left to go to L.A.  Oh, thank you.  You're an angel.  All right, thank you.  Yeah, and Frank in Long Island has a little more to this story.  Go ahead, Frank.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right, Frank.  My theory is that this guy's actually heartbroken because if you read, he was upset when he found out that the priest was fucking other kids.  He had a fantasy that he was going to meet up with his priest at some point, and they would live their life together.  He's heartbroken about this.  Oh, you think he's not the favorite anymore. 
[00:54:00]  Exactly.  He's a jilted lover?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's my theory.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  Dot net, dot net, dot net.  What does that mean?  All right.  Here's the, what a joke.  Violent cons treated to circus acts.  This is from the Boston Herald, I guess.  The Department of Correction has found a new way to entertain the most dangerous cons in the state.  They have sent in the circus last week, murderers, rapists, and other violent prisoners at Walpole. 
[00:54:30]  That was the famous person up there, right, Ant?  Of course.  When we were up that way, let's see.  We're being treated to entertainment in the form of strongmen, singers, and comedians who are part of a touring evangelistic Christian outreach group that uses laughs to urge cons into Bible study.  Oh, isn't that good?  Correction officers say clowns even joined the act.  They're bringing in the circus to the prison there.  Picture a big clown car pulling up to Walpole with strongmen, clowns getting out, and entertaining the murderers and rapists out in the yard. 
[00:55:00]  That's great.  Oh.  What the fuck, man?  Morale is at an all-time low, and we have to watch inmates who are throwing feces and urine at us be entertained by a circus,  having a great time.  Is that what they do?  You know how the clown runs up to the audience with a bucket and throws it in its confetti?  Right, right.  They do that, and it's just piss, urine, and vomit. 
[00:55:30]  Everyone laughs.  Juggling shanks.  The circus is a little different.  The new guy opens his asshole, and 50 dicks come out.  Nice high-wire act.  The guy goes over the wire and just leaves.  They don't notice it's a mass escape of very balanced people.  Six clowns to get out of the car, 50 Puerto Ricans to leave the compound in us. 
[00:56:00]  Fucking Boston.  Only in Boston, right?  There were never clowns.  I know that there was a strongman who is a former drug addict.  That's great.  How shocking is a strongman in prison?  Yeah.  You see some of the guys in prison. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  Come on.  They're monsters.  He could have probably beat his ass.  When told that the DOC was denying that clowns were part of last week's prison yard shows,  a correctional officer who watched it himself laughed and said,  that must have been the superintendent with the red nose and the floppy feet that I saw.  You've got to think the clowns and all had to be scared shitless in their environment.  Juggle, motherfucker. 
[00:57:00]  Someone's calling you out or something, Anthony.  Let's say hi to Adam.  Oh, no.  Adam, what's up?  Hey, Anthony, is that he threw piss and urine?  Did I say that?  Okay.  Sorry.  Oh, you did say piss, urine, and vomit?  I didn't think I said shit.  How about piss, shit, and vomit?  Okay?  Adam.  Happy birthday, Jim.  Hey, buddy.  Thank you.  All right.  So that's going on in Boston.  They're talking about that.  The clowns.  They're calling us out, don't they?  The clowns at the prison.  Okay.  Subway terrorist source. 
[00:57:30]  O4.  You hear about this guy?  Yeah.  They call him O4.  That sounds like a, I don't know, some kind of ominous name.  It's O4.  Look out.  A lot of people in New York City today kind of raising their eyebrows.  They're just kind of raising him up a little bit, going, oh, what was that subway turret  thing all about?  Uh-huh.  They're starting to blame the mayor.  Yeah.  Starting to blame him.  Well, his opponents are, saying, hey, he's trying to, like, gain a little bit politically  by having this subway turret thing happen. 
[00:58:00]  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, then he gets to show that he's kind of in control of the city.  Look at me running things.  Look at me now.  And that helps his approval rating.  And then, you know, he's going to be re-elected.  Right.  That's what his opponents are saying today.  And the opponents want to be elected, so they bash him.  Right.  But then the rest of New York City just kind of raising their eyebrows, going, what the  fuck was that all about?  And now it turns out that the source was a guy named O4.  You know about this guy?  O4.  Yes, O4.  He is one of these sources that has a nickname in Iraq. 
[00:58:30]  It's called O4.  And you know why they call him that?  Do you know why?  Because there's a joke within the intelligence community because he's O for 15 on any information  he's ever given the United States military and intelligence community.  So they call him O4.  That's his nickname.  He's that reliable.  No, nothing has ever come about after he said it.  And now I hear on the news he's gone. 
[00:59:00]  He just kind of disappeared into the woodwork.  How can he just disappear?  I know.  Aren't they holding these people?  Didn't they say it was from one of the prisons over there?  I don't know if it was a prison or he's just like an informant.  Maybe he's one of those guys, like one of the intelligence guys goes to the shoeshine  place and he goes, psst, I've got something for you.  And then he hands him a saw buck and gives him the info, something like that.  And then he just kind of disappeared because maybe now he's a little embarrassed.  Maybe now he's a little embarrassed at his information. 
[00:59:30]  O4.  Well, let's go to the audio here.  The details are about the informant in Iraq who got New York City to ratchet up security  in the subway system.  Security that after five days is only now being reduced.  According to knowledgeable sources, the informant in Iraq who warned terrorists planned to bomb  New York City's subway using rigged baby strollers, had the nickname among law enforcement of O4  as an O for 15.  That's his record for tips in the United States.  O for 15.  None right out of 15 tips. 
[01:00:00]  The United States pays informants large amounts of cash for tips in Iraq and O4 has offered  nearly two dozen tips to the U.S. military.  Fewer than six of his tips say sources were correct in Iraq and none were correct in the  United States.  He's now O for 16.  Very interesting.  So they're paying these guys.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  And they're quite poor.  So of course they're just going to babble about nonsense.  Of course.  And you know what?  That's costing us as taxpayers of this city because they've got to put all the cops on. 
[01:00:30]  And you know, they really ought to check these things out a little more.  If the guy is O4, if that's his name, O4, because he's never right, maybe you don't have  to ratchet up the security as much.  Maybe you throw just a couple guys out there.  Just in case.  You play the PSAs on the radio that we hear every day.  If you see something, say something.  That's the slogan.  Have you heard the slogan?  That's the slogan now for the NTA. 
[01:01:00]  It's brilliant.  Yeah.  They say if you see any suspicious packages, wires, things like that, suspicious people  wearing clothing that might not be appropriate for the weather, people acting weird, you're  supposed to, if you see something, say something.  How about that?  That's actually good advice, but it sounds like the type of thing you tell an eight-year-old.  Right.  It sounds like childlike advice.  Because we're all just children running around this city.  Right.  On a daily basis to them. 
[01:01:30]  Peppered by reporter questions, Mayor Bloomberg defended ratcheting up security.  Somebody made an allegation that there was three people were going to come to the United  States and lead an attack on our subway system.  The person that made that allegation passed his lie detector test.  That's only partially correct, according to sources.  Informant Ofer only passed certain questions of a lie detector test.  He failed other parts of the same test.  Which questions he passed and which ones he didn't is classified information. 
[01:02:00]  But other sources say the NYPD was told that the informant answered some of the lie detector  questions correctly and others inconclusively.  So was this a hoax?  I have no way of knowing now.  You know, this is going to take some time, I think, to totally unravel.  The same sources who deride the Iraqi informant as Ofer say it was a correct decision to increase  security in New York.  Sources say it comes down to making sure Ofer doesn't become 1-4. 
[01:02:30]  1-4.  Ah, 1-4.  How about we shoot Ofer in the back of the head?  You know, maybe Ofer's information would be a little better if we were able to beat him  with a phone book or put a leash around his neck and make them do pyramids in jail.  It's gotten to the point where we can't even pressure these guys for information, for real  information.  They're playing us like a bunch of idiots. 
[01:03:00]  Amnesty International.  Yeah.  We have to sit there and ask them nice questions, can't question them for too long, no physical,  forget about that, or mental.  I understand all that.  I understand all that.  But what happens behind closed doors?  Nothing, because people are scared shit of losing their careers.  I don't know about that.  You think there's some kind of secret system?  Yes, you put them into, why do you think they go to Jordan?  They bring them to places, that's why they're in Guantanamo.  They bring them in places where you can't get access to them. 
[01:03:30]  They want to get information, they're going to get information.  But Khalid Sheikh Mohammed hasn't been heard from since he was arrested.  Yeah.  He had no lawyer access, they're going to get what they want out of him.  Yeah.  They get what they want out of him.  I know they have a system and they have to treat the prisoners a certain way, but you  got to think, there's a few guys that know they can trust each other and they're behind  closed doors doing some things.  You got to think.  No?  I don't fault Bloomberg for this, by the way.  It's like, what are you supposed to do when you get that kind of warning?  It's like, you know, they didn't do anything when they had this information about  Atta and these other guys, he should do something. 
[01:04:00]  And he probably doesn't know at the time he's putting the alert out that it's 0-4, that's  the guy that gave him the info, it's not credible.  You just hear it and you got to do something.  You can't just do nothing.  Because, yeah, if something did happen and he did nothing, wow.  Yeah.  Well, where were you?  He was mistaken.  He thought it was 3-for-5.  Was it 3-for that?  He thought it was 3-for-5, but it was 0-4.  0-4.  He shouldn't even be in the game.  0-4.  Stop.  It should be Alex Rodriguez's nickname.  He's a disgraceful play rod of terrorists. 
[01:04:30]  Say goodbye to Joe Torre, by the way.  Bye-bye.  You think?  Goodbye.  It's not right for them to boot Torre.  Of course it's not right, but, you know, now the good old George Steinbrenner's pointing  all sorts of fingers.  He stinks, and Cashman is the problem.  That's the problem.  And Lupica, Michael Lupica, stinks.  Because the front page of the Daily News, of course we all know the front page of the  New York Post, Priest Made Me Gay.  Front page of the Daily News, it says, another Yankees disaster bust.  And then it has George Steinbrenner on the face of a $1 bill, and it says the New York 
[01:05:00]  Yankees instead of, you know, blah, blah, blah, the United States.  And it's a Lupica column, and it says, Lupica's damning verdict, why Boss Billion can't  buy a World Series.  But his money has already bought many World Series.  Yeah, like he missed one, or two, or three.  Well, like you said in the office, you can't win them all, and his system has worked over  the years, obviously.  But now Michael Lupica is going to call him out because he wasn't able to win with this 
[01:05:30]  particular team.  I guess he's supposed to win every year.  Well, is he saying that the teams that won, when Steinbrenner had a baseball and Gene  Michael kind of built the team, Steinbrenner would have got rid of Bernie, he would have  gotten rid of Jeter.  He would have traded that whole team because he's an asshole, and Brian Cashman has done  nothing baseball savvy.  Bob Watson was the genius, and now that he's gone, Brian Cashman just does what Steinbrenner  wants, which is spend money on shit.  On players that are just over the hill.  Fifty-eight.  Yeah.  So there's ten reasons they aren't worth it, and number one reason is Randy Johnson. 
[01:06:00]  Good.  Number two is A-Rod.  A-Rod had a horrible series, right?  Yeah, but I can't fault him for that.  He had a good season.  Yeah.  He just had a bad series.  You know, and that's when it counts.  So did Sheffield.  Throw a cliche in there.  You know, gotta come to the table when it counts.  You know, 110%, that's what I want to see a ball player give.  Right, right.  110%.  Leave it all on the table.  We left it all on the field.  Did you?  They should just keep Joe Torre there.  He's a great guy and a great manager, but... 
[01:06:30]  He's not the problem.  This is how baseball and all sports works.  If you don't win, then they assume it's the coach's problem.  It's ridiculous.  Dude, how is it Torrey's fault that fucking A-Rod grounds into a double play with Jeter on first?  And how is it Torrey's fault that Randy Johnson has overpaid all that money, blows me off for a picture,  and then gives up a bunch of runs in the playoffs?  Bastard.  How is that Torrey's fault?  There's a correction, by the way.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Hey, you got a $1 billion bill on the Daily News, not a $1 bill.  Yeah, I just saw that as you said that. 
[01:07:00]  And I hope he's wearing us all the same.  Sorry about that.  That's all right.  All right, have a great day.  All right.  We got one more clip from Bloomberg, by the way, to finish up the subway terror source with O4.  Error.  Independent security analysts we talked to also agree that New York City made the correct decision.  They had to make sure that this was not the one time that O4 was correct and became 1-4.  In addition to that, law enforcement sources say that Mayor Bloomberg was just politically lucky  that this real security threat occurred when he was getting heat for not debating at the Apollo Theater. 
[01:07:30]  Was that really a big controversy, that the mayor wasn't debating at the Apollo Theater?  Debating what?  I don't think that mattered.  He's sitting there debating Farrar and the other guy, the other one that's not going to win.  Bloomberg obviously got this thing wrapped up.  He said he was going to do two debates, and that didn't include the Apollo Theater.  Why is he going to go to the Apollo Theater and debate the Democrats like that? 
[01:08:00]  It doesn't.  Of course not.  It doesn't make sense.  It's not advantageous to him.  Right.  Let's say hi to Charles the Trucker.  Charles, what's up?  Hey, man.  Love your show.  All right, Charles.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Oh, Charles.  Listen, man, I read the paper this morning.  This schoolteacher, a female schoolteacher, got suspended for molesting this 13-year-old kid.  And he told.  That's terrific. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, he told.  He told.  I can't believe that.  Why would you tell?  She's evidently hot.  Because we all know if you see something, say something.  The 13th is the little puss-hall.  It applies to molestation as well.  A little puss-hall.  Well, I got messed with this school, and I never told anybody.  All right.  I mean, it wasn't bad for me.  I mean, she was fat, but I didn't care.  I mean, hell.  All right.  I had to do her yard work, but it was worth it. 
[01:09:00]  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Liar.  Liar.  Liar.  Liar.  You take it easy, man.  I'm looking at headlines from across America, and, uh...  No one's really coming across.  God.  Coming to the table.  Everyone else is very boring today.  We have Priests May Be Gay on the front page of our paper.  That's a good one.  And, uh...  So far, I don't even see any worth mentioning.  Uh...  No.  No.  Well, Burlington, Vermont. 
[01:09:30]  Homeless man killed.  Oh.  And town brainstorms funding ideas.  Ooh.  What happened to the homeless guy?  I don't know.  The writing's too small.  And who really cares, anyway?  Homeless.  We only care about...  Here's what we care about in this country.  Attractive people.  We care what happens to them.  We care about what happens to our own, kind of in a big disaster.  Yeah.  Can I add one? 
[01:10:00]  Sure.  We care about white people.  White people, yeah.  We care about white people.  Especially white children.  We really care about the white children.  If one goes missing, we'll send out everybody after that.  One little white kid.  Especially if he's cute or she's pretty.  Yeah.  They got the Amber Alert.  They don't have one for the shwoogies.  You don't see that on the highway.  The Shaniqua Alert?  The Shaniqua Alert.  You never see that one.  No.  Eh.  If you see the Shaniqua Alert on the highway, you're not even slowing down. 
[01:10:30]  You're not looking.  The only brake lights that come out are from Colt 45 trucks.  Hey, did they ever find the chick?  I mean, they didn't find him.  Did they ever find him?  Nothing ever happened in Barb...  Where was it?  Aruba?  Yeah, nothing, right?  Nah.  Those guys go to jail or are they out?  Ah, hurricane hit.  We didn't...  We had to move on.  Artificious.  That story was starting to heat up and then the hurricane hit and we had to move on.  You know?  Yeah.  And where's the 24-hour coverage?  There's an earthquake that happened.  A lot of people missing and dead.  Well, that's it.  You know, 30,000 people dead over there. 
[01:11:00]  And as Americans, we really don't care.  We don't care.  They were crowing when...  Remember Private Katrina?  Remember the Islamic radicalists were saying Private Katrina?  Well, Pakistan's not exactly a Western cultural hub.  Right.  Well, you guys just took it in the ass nicely, didn't you?  Certainly did.  Where's all the remarks coming from the insurgents?  Why am I talking to the insurgents and taking them to task?  You are.  Oof.  Yeah.  Why don't you comment on that, you?  You're poo-pooing them.  Like they're authors.  We're authors.  Reporters, I meant to say. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  But, yeah, we don't care as people because it's far away.  They're not us.  They don't look like Americans.  So screw it.  That's how we are.  And the news doesn't cover it because they know that.  Know what we care about now?  What?  What's the big thing we care about?  The bird flu.  Well, this story is really starting to creep up on people.  Why don't we talk about the bird flu when we get back?  Very frightened of the bird flu.  But you've got some things that you could do to protect yourself from the bird flu.  Protect yourself from the bird flu. 
[01:12:00]  We'll tell you about it.  After these messages.  I can't find a bra that will holster my massive hooter.  I'm very proud of my big toe.  Thank God for Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Whip'em Out Wednesday.  There's no you.  There is only me.  There is no you.  There is only me.  There is no fucking you.  There is only me.  There is no fucking you.  There is only me. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Hi.  We've got lots to do.  Lots and lots of things to do.  We're going to be at the Javits Center on Friday, Anthony.  A rare public appearance for the boys.  I remember it last year.  I remember doing that last year.  We hung out there.  And remember Pat from Munaki was right there the entire time, not shutting up.  Oh, just standing there?  Oh, he was just standing there the whole time. 
[01:13:00]  We were signing stuff.  And he was just babbling incessantly about Warner Brothers cartoons.  What are you doing at the Javits Center?  It's the Digital Life Show, Jim Norton.  This Friday at the Javits Convention Center.  Excuse me.  1230 to 130.  But we'll hang a little later than that, right?  Or we won't.  It's an hour there.  An hour?  We'll be there more than an hour if they want us to be there more than an hour.  I will sign until the last person wants something signed. 
[01:13:30]  I'm going to say that.  But if, by chance, you can catch me on the FDR at 85 miles an hour and roll the window  down and hand me something, I will absolutely sign it.  I'm going to throw the fans a bone.  Stay late indeed.  I'm going to throw the fans a bone.  Yeah.  I'm going to sign 30 things.  30?  I'm going to have...  That's right.  So everyone bring two items.  I will sign my name 30 times this Friday at the Javits Convention Center. 
[01:14:00]  Jacob Javits Convention Center.  Really do give back.  The Digital Life Show from 1230 to 130.  Fantastic.  I'm in a good mood.  I'll sign 30 things.  What do you got in front of you, Anthony?  Oh, I've got the listener suggestions.  We didn't even put out this assignment, did we?  We didn't really put this out.  No.  Opie had mentioned that he bought in on a restaurant with his brother.  We're waiting for the grand opening.  With my two brothers.  Two brothers.  Yes. 
[01:14:30]  Good old Brett.  It's going to be Brett's restaurant.  I want him to...  You're the silent partner.  Yeah, of course.  You got the backing.  I go to a lot of restaurants.  That's what I know about the restaurant business.  What do I know?  Yeah.  I want my brother to call it Brett's, but he's still trying to figure out a name.  Brett's?  Well, the listeners came up with the 202, which is kind of cool in a way, I guess.  But I don't know.  We're seriously trying to figure out a name.  Fire?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  The restaurant's going to...  The place gets struck by lightning?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  The restaurant's going to be in Huntington, by the way. 
[01:15:00]  Huntington?  Yes.  Very nice.  Convenient.  Well, we didn't even put the word out, but the listeners, just gone wild here.  Coming up with the names for your restaurant, Opie.  And menu items.  All right.  A few of the names.  The Fidel Castro Eating London Broil.  It's a little wordy, but it does conjure up an image.  How about Liddy's Homemade Throat Yogurt?  Is that one of the items or the name of the restaurant?  Well, this is under names for restaurants.  That's got to be an item. 
[01:15:30]  That's more of an item.  Yes.  Again.  What's that?  I see you drink some, and then the rest, they just throw on your back as you're walking out.  That's how you take it home.  Do you have a to-go bag?  Yeah.  They just dump it in your hair.  We are taking this very seriously.  Of course.  This also looks like a menu item, but it's under the restaurant names.  Andrea Yates Dead Baby Stew.  It's got a bunch of stew with five little potatoes full. 
[01:16:00]  All right.  Now here's a more sensible name.  The Steel Cut Hut.  Because I hope he enjoys his steel cut oatmeal in the morning.  I ate it once or twice.  How about the Javalog Bar and Grill?  All right.  Where you can hang with a friend, Javalog, a glass of wine.  Every bar stool turned upside down.  The Good Luck Bro Granola Bar and Grill. 
[01:16:30]  It's going to be a place where celebrities go, maybe.  We're trying for a Zagat's rating.  Right.  Well, Hughes' Classic Restaurant.  Not funny.  All right.  Well, Classic.  You always say Classic.  Classic.  Oh, very good.  I didn't even realize that.  I'm trying not to say Classic as much.  That's Classic.  I'm trying to not say it as much.  This has a homey sound to it.  Mom's Box.  You're going down a Mom's Box? 
[01:17:00]  Your Mom's Box.  I like that.  That's a good one.  I like this.  The menu has exploded.  I don't say phones have exploded as much.  The menu has exploded.  I now say they're going crazy.  They're out of control.  How about Loogies?  Loogies?  Why Loogies?  I don't know why Loogies.  All right.  Opie's Underwater French Cuisine.  I like that.  You had the fight with a French guy underwater.  You can incorporate that. 
[01:17:30]  Yes.  The Pest Palace.  Sounds more like a gaming arcade.  Which one's Opie?  Come down to which one's Opie.  I don't know about this one.  Hoo-Hoo's?  You want to go to Hoo-Hoo's?  The My Team's Suck Sports Lounge.  Who wouldn't want to go to Opie and Dopey's?  All right.  That'd be nice.  The Gregster's.  How's Your Drinking Hole Restaurant. 
[01:18:00]  The Party Rock Cafe.  Poe down there.  Spinning.  And More Gooder.  More Gooder.  I like that.  Wouldn't that be good?  All right.  All the waiters and waitresses wear rollerblades and join Opie for the Robert Reed cocktail  hour.  Bring your robe.  It is required.  And then some of the menu items.  Maybe you could have the Pat Munaki.  Pat from Munaki on the menu.  It's a bottomless cup of eggnog.  You drink more than 20 cups.  It's on the house. 
[01:18:30]  And, of course, they'd have to drag over a big garbage pail to your table just in case  you vomit.  The Binder Grinder.  Three egg whites and some Pepto-Bismol on a hoagie roll.  Be bound up just like Opie.  The Lil' Jimmy.  Chili grapes and a tall glass of milk guaranteed to make you poot when you're nervous.  Maybe a little scared.  Opie omelets made from egg whites stuffed with specially prepared dog liver topped with 
[01:19:00]  yogurt and crunchy topping.  I think that's a Chester reference.  Bowl of grapes.  That's right.  A whole bowl of grapes hand-selected by Opie to ensure that you fart like a marine with  a case of bad gas.  You eat these grapes knowing an hour later you can fart out anyone in the room.  Yummy.  Ben's Hog Roast.  It's the biggest hog you've ever seen.  It's so big no one's ever finished it.  I guess if you eat the entire Ben's Hog Roast, it's on the house.  You get your picture posted up on the wall. 
[01:19:30]  Very proud.  The stalker patty.  One hand-ground one-half pound of beef.  Fried in a pan until it tastes like cardboard.  Served on a stale bun with no spices, no flavor.  Completely virgin.  The dish is destined to be the worst item on the menu.  A crime scene soup.  A piece of white toast in a bowl of tomato soup.  That's good.  It should say, the description, a piece of white toast in a bowl of tomato soup, period. 
[01:20:00]  You know, like end of subject, period.  No?  That was kind of funny.  Nice steak.  No, you don't.  Yeah.  White short sundae.  Vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, marshmallow fluff, drizzle, and white chocolate topped with strawberry and maraschino cherry compote.  That's a little joke I told that also bombed back in the old days.  And Chester's last stand.  It's prime rib, baked potato, and a glass of box wine. 
[01:20:30]  Baked potatoes, deep dish pizza by, pudding dessert, sugar and butter sandwiches for dessert.  The Don Western omelet, electric shock OJ, because that's a glass of juice.  E-Rock's garlic bread.  Ant B's pickled punk pie and tenderized liver and onions.  Very good.  That's good. 
[01:21:00]  Tenderized under Opie's boot.  Yeah, they're having a lot of fun with that.  Oh, they certainly are.  John in New York City, what's up?  What's up, boys?  I have a menu item for you.  How about Opie's marshmallow and butt fudge fondue?  All right.  That's a good dessert.  You can have a single marshmallow drizzled with fudge.  I'm not sharing any more stories with you guys.  Ron in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, I got a menu item for your restaurant, Opie.  Okay.  How about these fuck-faced fajitas?  And you have to wait 45 minutes before you can eat them. 
[01:21:30]  Wow, that's very good.  He even remembers, wait 45 minutes.  Okay, Christian sitcom.  We saw this on the tube this morning, and we told Nathaniel to get us some audio.  You know, there's so much nasty stuff on television.  It's about time we have something nice.  A Christian sitcom.  Christian sitcom.  Why not?  This will be followed by the Evolution song, by the way.  Yeah.  We're going to get a little religion today.  We're going to give you a little religion. 
[01:22:00]  So, they're trying to get a sitcom on TV.  The Christian sitcom.  Yeah.  We've had the Christian superhero, right?  Yeah, boy, that really took off, didn't it?  That was, what's his name?  Willie Ames from Eight is Enough?  Yeah.  Dressed up Bible Man.  Thank you, Eric.  You're kidding, right?  Dressed up, no, Jimmy.  You never saw Bible Man?  No.  I don't mean sit down and watch the damn thing, but you haven't heard of Bible Man?  Willie Ames' latest project?  Is this new? 
[01:22:30]  He's been doing it for many years now.  Many years.  What a douche.  Yeah, it's like a comic book character.  What, does he fly in and bore people?  Until they give up?  Bible Man, look at that.  I call it a lawsuit from George Lucas, man, because he's holding a lightsaber.  It's absolutely a lightsaber.  Jesus.  He's all dressed up in Bible Man attire.  What is Bible Man's superpowers, by the way?  And why would Bible Man need protection?  Really?  Yeah.  Why not just wear a robe and maybe a crown? 
[01:23:00]  Right.  Some sandals?  There you go.  Christ.  That's all Jesus needed.  Jesus was Bible Man.  What's his superpowers, though?  Bible Man's spectacular battles against the flamboyant villains of darkness are...  Flamboyant?  He's gay?  No, he's fighting against flamboyancy.  Fighting the gay man.  Bible Man's spectacular battle against the flamboyant villains of darkness...  Villians.  ...are an exciting way to...  It's a villain.  ...is an exciting way to introduce your children to the Bible and the power of God's word. 
[01:23:30]  This is the problem with religious people.  You fucking tediously unfunny, boring people.  We can be hip and cool and get the kids involved.  What do the kids like these days?  I can see them all at that meeting.  What do the kids like?  A big blackboard.  All right, they like video games.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch on the blackboard.  Video games.  Holy shit.  All frantically drawing on...  What else do they like?  Comic books.  What do the kids like?  Comic books.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch 
[01:24:00]  anthony listener this came out of dave douglas's i'm a pd and here's the pd workbook like you turn 
[01:24:30]  to the page and it tells you what to do to be a pd no real creativity no originality so he like  decided it was good or probably heard somewhere to have the talent come in and kind of get an idea  of what your listener would look like it it would better uh it would make the show better because  now you know who you're talking to complete waste of time because we're playing alternative rock  music rock we know it was called uh uh the only station that really rocks i guess yeah and we're 
[01:25:00]  playing nirvana pearl jam smashing pumpkins that's the machine could you play like a hole right  thank you what a waste of time we knew our every call we we went to the shows we we could see our  audience we didn't need to make a profile yeah what do what do you think the uh average age of  your your listener is and meanwhile my head is like ding ding ding ding ding 18 bunch of kids 18 he's 
[01:25:30]  like oh no you'd be surprised no it's a little we've done some marketing research it's older because  you want it to be older even though it's not we went to the shows it was 18 up to 25 like that  trust occasionally you'd get a 30 year old guy coming in but trust me we saw them naked they were 18  pull wow sometimes  so anyway i would say 23 if the rock bus is a rockin keep the police away 
[01:26:00]  the aaf a rock bus is a rockin make sure their parents aren't here to pick them up  can you do the first part again i have one for you if the aaf bus rock bus is a rockin  someone might be doing a naked headstand  anyway oh jesus we're just you know we're just goofing off yeah of course anyway so we've been 
[01:26:30]  through this this type of thing profile we're not going to waste your time because then we had a  we had to uh figure out what kind of job they would have uh are they married do they have kids  what do they do and meanwhile i'm fresh out of um construction so i was like i pictured a guy  because i was always on job sites listening to rock music and the whole job site would listen  so i said i picture you know a guy a working joe that's out there oh no no no again dave was like 
[01:27:00]  no no um more of a uh a professional um businessman type he wanted somebody in an office setting  what a dope it's like would you stop it there was a blue collar guy with a with a pickup truck  yeah a hot chick that had a bunch of tattoos he didn't want that at all we knew we knew he's  succeeding in the business now dave douglas seven years later on the fucko list hey welcome to the 
[01:27:30]  fucko list dave he started the fucko list first name number one rich the trucker what's up  hey good morning fellas i was just wondering if uh bible man's sidekick was a little 10 year old boy  i don't think bible man has a sidekick yeah little young boy all right punch it out so you guys want  to hear some audio from the christian sitcom yeah well this really is a sign of our times some 60 
[01:28:00]  million americans as you know identify themselves as evangelical christians that's having an impact all  across our society on presidential elections the nomination of supreme court justices and it turns  out on pop culture they're calling it the first show of its kind we need to surrender this to our  savior right now you and i and believe us it's not your father's sitcom well not that kind of father 
[01:28:30]  anyhow oh well we thank you that uh we can come and do a job and do our best to your glory and your honor  in jesus name amen amen amen let's do it i want to make no mistake about it that when i say this is  a christian situation comedy that we claim christ is our savior what channel is going to run wow i don't  know jimmy aren't you in this aren't you the neighbor in this i call it lucky louie but it's kind of like  a christian sitcom right i actually uh put on a collar and do the molesting i can't wait to see this my 
[01:29:00]  favorite is episode three the jew is dirty  hey that jew next door gives me the heebie-jeebies  yeah that's the wacky neighbor comes in every like oh my god do you have any money  here comes the money lender again he's got a big hook nose of course he does they play jewy jew music 
[01:29:30]  when he walks in i'm cheap i'm chintzy and i don't tip and his face pops up through the window  do you have any money  big close-up on his face  oy vey  the pilot episode jesus is all frustrated because he's trying to eat sunflower seeds and he just can't  get it for pete's sake 
[01:30:00]  no savior you gotta lift the plate up to your mouth with both hands and tip them  oh god well let's keep an open mind we got more audio yeah i want to hear some audio maybe it's funny  it's a christian sitcom a christian sitcom that might seem an oxymoron but on pastor greg they see 
[01:30:30]  the medium comedy as the best way to communicate the message and this is not a hollywood production  it's being taped just outside of pittsburgh the brainchild of greg robbins he's the creator writer  director and star robbins was once an la actor and model who was born again he says the character of  pastor greg is very much autobiographical he was a once your average guy living in the world  womanizing drinking gambling that kind of thing and through a series of comical but real events 
[01:31:00]  he uh surrenders his life to christ and the progressive themes might raise some christian  eyebrows in one episode pastor greg discovers he has an illegitimate daughter my daughter you you're my  daughter wow wow wow it's never a comical thing that brings you to christ never like any born again  it's never you know i was just laughing my balls off and uh decided back i'm gonna dedicate my life to 
[01:31:30]  jesus it's always the bottom of the barrel always never i was getting blown by a chicken i look down  she's 450 she falls down the stairs never a fun such we're trying to have some real christian fun episode  seven mr rabinowitz controls the world bank oh it's kind of like south park voss dies at the end of every 
[01:32:00]  episode  no  all right we got more audio here robbins has been shopping the show to television executives for nine  long years wow secular execs didn't see much funny about christianity and christian execs didn't see  much christian about being funny it sounded like you were sort of the twixt in between and trying to sell 
[01:32:30]  this yeah you get to look i mean a christian what i mean there was a three-year period i thought my name  was you're nuts ah see the comedy like that with comedy like that oh boy i i see winner i i see winner  you know what it is he's having trouble this poor guy this poor bastard he's between a rock and a roman  soldier 
[01:33:00]  now i've long since been saying that we should have a greg and tony website because there are  certain people we could get on the phone and interview where they couldn't research the fact  that we are opie and anthony yeah demons spawned from hell they could go to the greg and tony uh website  and see that it's a fun show they'd be willing to come on yeah yeah because i would love to uh  have a little chat with this guy oh he must just imagine he's there sitting or or on the phone uh  talking with us and we take a call from maybe steve from yellowstone 
[01:33:30]  want to hear more audio you bet i do of course all right the christian network picked it up oh but  the president of christian cornerstone television bit he thinks the social climate is right we wanted  to make a statement that i think is appropriate this at this time in history is your goal though  conversion i've chosen service so it's my job to go out throughout the world and spread the 
[01:34:00]  and spread the word of jesus christ does the show do that i'm not sure jim young who plays the church  office manager on the show has a background in christian theater he hopes people will laugh first  and then listen to the message i think often when we're laughing that's when we're open to  hearing things in a different way oh boy it's like a cross between the uh ptl club and jackass  the pitch meeting 
[01:34:30]  you know it's funny all the religions are doing it now islamic uh people have their own little  sitcom it's about a bomb maker who's just so goofy he always blows a hand off  but they can they can only get two episodes written  the wacky neighbor oh four comes over  today talks about some plot that never happens  oh episode five is a real hoot that was nominated for an emmy show me a clit and i'll show you a 
[01:35:00]  beheading  well they have a goal with this show do they have a goal good cornerstone says the sitcom will start  in a hundred markets around the country some christian and some secular and he thinks that  number will grow robbins freely admits his goal is more than laughter i believe that the masses 
[01:35:30]  aren't going to look and go well they're they're claiming christ as their savior in it i'm not  going to watch it no they're going to watch it they're going to like it and then also they're  going to see that christianity is not what they thought it was  let's say hi to rough rider from what's only true if people thought christianity was a good sitcom  rough rider hey guys how are you doing all right rough rider didn't they have a show like this in 
[01:36:00]  the 80s uh with uh the guy who played george jefferson called amen that's different though  it's a guy playing a preacher it's funny you mentioned george jefferson my good friend sherman  called me last night like to bring him on this radio program why there you go because he's doing  uh the surreal life okay um we'd love to have him on that's different though that's that's not like  a religious message a guy you know punch it out all right we have one more clip here now the show  debuts later this week and it should look pretty good it's being shot in high definition television 
[01:36:30]  another reason the producers think so many of the secular stations who've signed on were interested  diane if it's in all these markets clarity they expect to make sitcom level money and where does the  money go well that's very interesting you know the president of cornerstone television says this  project is so important to him right now he's not necessarily looking to make money he's just hoping  not to lose money so that's a pretty nice situation for a sitcom to be in just doesn't want to lose 
[01:37:00]  money boy what a pitch pastor greg you don't know if it's going to affect people or not we're just  putting it out there it's comedy episode four pastor greg kicks a little dog who knocks his food over  uh pastor greg is a real horse's patoot 
[01:37:30]  please find out if we can get tape of this when it happens yes we absolutely need to get these episodes  on tape i want to buy the whole dvd uh season one already i want it oh nathaniel um yeah well  we're doing a search for it i'm not sure any new york uh channels are carrying it right now probably  not really you would think well someone out there will help us out and send it in right yeah how was  your caroline show it was pretty good cool i went up uh right after kevin meanie he stopped by so wow 
[01:38:00]  that was fun stars start leaving kevin meaning nathaniel bryan people got their money worth they  enjoy kevin yeah that's more or less cool it's a nice guy hey uh i like his new stuff that he does  well he he does have a story about being arrested at the airport that happened  when we're at three four years ago four years ago hey uh pastor greg's gonna be on fox and friends  this friday morning let's uh roll tape guys he'll be on fox and friends this friday morning 
[01:38:30]  all right wow we could wrap up our religious break with the the monkey song what's the monkey song well  it's an anti-evolution song by kids what why would they make an anti-evolution song why why can't the church  just pastor greg would like this maybe uh steve can come in and explain this to us 
[01:39:00]  where is steve come on steve we're waiting where are you steve usually gets the word and then it  takes him a little time that's all he doesn't know any better he's very busy  hey steve good morning how are you fine how's the hybrid running hybrid's running great good yeah it's  running really well what like you're expecting that i'm going to come in here and say yeah one of these  days you will wrecked it one of these days you will just no no that it'll have broken and it's 
[01:39:30]  irreparable and maybe you're inconsolable what's the monkey song about the monkey song is in the anti  it's a anti anti-evolution procreationist uh song that i guess kids in the bible belt are taught  yeah there's a lot of these there's you know networks of christian christian theme songs yeah just  throw away their books and yeah we'll have them sing these little ditties we find more of these  i'm working on it all right you guys want to hear the uh the monkey song of course been eagerly awaiting 
[01:40:00]  it since when i want to hear monkey song you play monkey song hey claire hey claire you know uh anthony  god damn the show just takes takes twists and turns remind me because we do have to play the monkey  song but but say monk you know play the monkey song with the whole claire thing from the old days  there's a dj i don't know husband and wife team no way  a dj radio team husband and wife that has to be before the worst bit of drivel ever it made the 
[01:40:30]  fucking daily news we're celebrating a year on satellite radio and where's our article where's  our article in the new york post in the daily news they're too busy writing about a husband and wife  team in florida uh looks like jersey there jimmy morning mates g-rock dj's brian phillips and jen  ursillo a couple of new jersey radio disc jockeys will be lying down on the job this morning lying down 
[01:41:00]  on the job i get it what are they doing wacky radio alert as part of a fundraising stunt brian phillips  and jen uh your silo way to have a name that's hard to pronounce if you're trying to get exposure  by the way jesus the morning hosts on g-rock will be in bed until they raise fifty thousand dollars  for breast cancer awareness 
[01:41:30]  so we have to do nothing while you send in your cash i don't get it what's he gonna be doing the  whole time kissing her tits and going thank god you're here and thank god you're here they better  not be stealing our feels for meals uh concept they might be stealing our feels for meals concept it  sounds like walk up and squeeze jen's boobies and uh and give in give some money well they're trying to  raise awareness what will happen is you'll hear oh this is so nice and then ah shit 
[01:42:00]  oh well i got the i got the uh we got the g-rock site up over here anthony eric found it uh  here's the big g morning show with brian and g-rock found the g-rock site hey hey there's a preview  can we get some audio of these uh of these guys oh they do the big g news at 5 a.m then 6 a.m and 
[01:42:30]  every half hour until 9 a.m why don't we have something we do every day at a certain time  we do work we stink  i'll take you inside radio oh it's a mistake radio has been doing for a very very long time  and it's these dumb program directors out there that were not good enough to have their own show  so they're going to tell you how to do a radio show it's kind of like that gym teacher  yeah gym teacher is just a useless person not failed at everything but now he's going to tell 
[01:43:00]  you how to do jumping jackson make it as an athlete how to climb the the the rope and how to kick around  that big medicine ball thing and how to keep a secret how to keep a secret but uh and these stupid  program directors that they don't understand uh radio shows that just fly by the seat of their pants  yeah like ours every day we have no fucking idea what we're doing that's a dive in head first we're  the most prepared unprepared radio show in america we have a great staff uh behind us they're throwing 
[01:43:30]  stuff at us all morning long and then we make uh make shit up right basically that's what we do  but these program directors out there they don't understand that concept they don't they don't want  to give that much control to their uh personalities so they force them to do particular things at  the exact time every morning here's a bit you probably heard in your local market it's called  battle of the sexes ah but they do it every morning at 7 15 let's say okay you're joe commuter you get in 
[01:44:00]  your car every morning at uh 7 10 and maybe you uh you're only in the car until 7 30 what do you hear  every fucking morning battle of the battle of the fucking sexes so if you don't like battle of the  sexes you're you're gone but if you love it see that's what they're saying but the odds are of  course you're gonna get sick of it so you know if you were a smart program director out there you  would get all these features but throw them all over the ball field is that the bit where she mouths 
[01:44:30]  off you hit her in the face that's right i love battle of the sexes joel and hedda in new york you're  on g-rock battle of the sexes battle of the sexes s peterson from modesto you are our winner  but these program directors don't get it most people are in thaw what a strange name  but uh you have won our battle of the sexes you got it already holy shit uh but i mean all kidding 
[01:45:00]  aside do you understand what's going on here the program directors they're a bunch of dopes they don't  get it you know if you have all these features you should just keep mixing them up every morning  and then uh you know the listeners get a little taste uh that's a little different every morning  when they jump in their car because their ride is the exact same every every fucking morning  virtual smorgasbord what the hell it's like a fucking restaurant over there your waiter is  bringing you stuff he's leaving coming back he did the port when i asked what i ordered was  and you guys can have some it's called emergency i'll explain it to you after what what is it 
[01:45:30]  emergency emergency wait we got three bits on the table here yeah hold off on the emergency  thing for a second that the plate's coming down i'll be spin that one we're in the middle of g-rock  the plate the plate we're talking about g-rock it's gonna fall off the pole spin it  holy shit what we have a monkey song we have the g-rock battle monkey song what's that emergency a  battle of what let's stick with the g show the the focus the g-rock pastor greg  we did that already all right so it's a it's a morning show called uh it's brian and jen can i

I just want to add, guys, that this used to be a respectable alternative radio station.  Right.  And one morning, one Monday morning driving to work, I turned it on and hungry like the  wolf was playing.  Awful.  We'd like to thank our food sponsor, Hooter. 
[02:08:30]  And as far as the situation is concerned, we'll keep you up.  Well, you understand.  Jesus.  You guys.  All right.  Well, thank you, Don.  Hey, don't forget to tell them about the G-spot moment.  The G-spot moment.  Okay.  Thanks.  Let's say hi to Bill in Tom's River.  Bill?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:09:00]  Are you a pest of this fine radio program?  What's up, buddy?  Are you a pest of this show?  You're damn right.  All right.  Long-time listener, man, since any of you.  What's up, Jimmy?  Happy birthday, brother.  Thanks, buddy.  Holy crap.  We got listeners pulling up to the Rockaway bedding like crazy.  We got Bill from Tom's River on the line.  We got Mike from New Jersey.  Mike?  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  You're pulling up to the Rockaway bedding?  I'm pulling up right now, and they're making me talk to a different park.  They see the wow stick on my car.  Don't you fuck up our jobs, you motherfuckers.  I swear to God. 
[02:09:30]  I can't do worse than you guys did.  Well, there's got to be something we could do, though.  Yeah.  Anyone have a gas can and matches?  I'm pulling through a different park around.  I'm backing up so I can't see it.  No.  He's a breast cancer charity.  Yes.  We will be crucified if we interfere in any way with a breast cancer charity.  We love breasts.  We love breasts.  That's right.  I should say we love breast cancer.  Yeah, we have to have all these stickers made.  Ow.  No. 
[02:10:00]  We'll.  There is nothing I can think of that our listeners can do at this situation that will  not get us fucked.  That's a good point.  What could they do?  All right.  If you're at Tom's River, you know, take a peek.  Take a peek.  Get on the phone and let us know what they look like, what's going on, how many people  are there.  But what are you going to do?  Dive in bed with them?  Yeah.  Fuck them tits.  All right.  Yeah, I guess there's not much you can do.  That's Jen. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, she doesn't look as good as she does in her publicity shot, now does she?  Let me see.  Jen's Pride and Joy, a Shaq-sized Nestle Crunch Bar.  Ah, because it's a huge chocolate bar.  Courtesy of our White Stripes and Pinstripes Weekend winner.  Holy crap, they do the hackiest shit.  Oh, my God.  Is that them, uh, outside?  And then they got pictures of their family, it looks like.  Ugh.  That's... 
[02:11:00]  All right.  Uh...  This was a barbaric, a barbaric segment.  Oh, we get it.  I want it stricken from the record.  Oh, it really was just shameful.  Oh, we got a sample of their program.  What a couple of boobs we are.  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris?  Yo, it's Chris from Live Wire again, guys.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Live Wire, playing the Halloween party.  Halloween night, Hard Rock Cafe. 
[02:11:30]  We can't wait for our big party.  I think you should change the promotion to W-O-O-W.  Whip one out one day.  All right.  I didn't know he was going to say that.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Let's, uh, listen to a sample of their program.  The Wiggy Morning Show with Brian and Jen.  This is Larry.  How you doing?  Larry, what's up?  And how you doing, Jen?  I'm very good.  Womp, womp, womp, womp.  See, this is my point.  Yeah.  We got to clone Jen and get one who's single.  That's what we need to do.  And then auction off dates for charity with Ms. Jennifer. 
[02:12:00]  You need to be our promotion director.  Yes, I would love that.  Are you allowed to pimp out DJs these days?  Uh, I don't see anything written.  Only if you get 15% from McGreevy, it'll probably be okay.  On G-Rock Radio.  Oh, that's a good one.  I don't know how we're going to compete against that, guys, to be quite honest with you.  And, Opie, during that break, that was awful.  What did I do?  Well, you finally got through to her on the phone and you wished her good luck bra. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  You know what?  The monkey song is going to have to wait because we're going to have to reset the show now.  Oh, my head is.  My head literally hurts.  We're going to have to reset.  Oh.  We're going to reboot.  Reboot.  We're rebooting.  You know, I really, I got to be honest.  I hope Steve from Yellowstone doesn't call.  We're going to reboot.  Oh, we got that author that called during that segment.  Rainbow.  Rainbow.  Bring me a pair. 
[02:13:00]  When we get back, we got the...  Ramon!  Bring me a disappointed husband.  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  When we get back with the Opie and Anthony program after we reboot, Ramon, carpool with 
[02:13:30]  me to the support group.  There's an author.  Ramon!  Ramon!  Put Craigslist under my favorite places.  Ramon!  Throw out those bikini tops.  When we return with the Opie and Anthony program, we're going to be talking to a fine author 
[02:14:00]  of the book, uh, what's the name of the book over there, Jimmy?  Go ahead.  Go on.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  I have to do it.  Everything you want to know about sex is wrong.  And you said the book's good?  I liked some of the stuff I was reading.  It was just interesting.  I didn't really read that much, though. 
[02:14:30]  All right.  We'll probably take serious questions, and maybe, uh, who knows?  Maybe this is the return of Steve from Yellowstone today.  Ah.  When we talk to the author.  You never know.  Let's say hi to Rich.  Rich, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Just to let you know, I'm out in front of, uh, Rockaway Bedding right now, uh, down in  Tom's River.  Yeah.  And they got the tents and everything that are set up out front.  I, I'm just waiting for this, uh, sign to fall right on the tent for it.  Yes, Jim?  They have tents set up.  Are there, are there two right next to me? 
[02:15:00]  No, they said they lost one.  Yeah.  They actually said that on their show.  They lost a tent.  Yeah, I kind of noticed that one is kind of a little bit higher than the other one.  Wait, one is what?  One is a little bit higher than the other one.  He's just reporting from the scene.  They even said that on their own show, that they're losing a tent.  They had two tents set up for this fine, uh, hack radio promotion.  All right, uh, all right.  If anything else happens, give us a call back, okay?  All right.  Officially, we don't want you guys doing anything. 
[02:15:30]  Joe from Tom's River.  Hey, how you doing?  All right, Joe.  All right.  Yeah, they got one tent blown down, partially, uh, disassembled, and they're, uh, locked down  in the other one.  The one, I can take a walk over there and see if we can get them on the air with you.  Is that one tent holding on for dear life?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The other one, they even got the bricks holding it down, concrete.  They've got an RV here.  You know they're sleeping in the RV at night.  Oh.  I don't know if you should try to get them on. 
[02:16:00]  If they're doing a breast cancer charity thing, there's really nothing good that can come  out of them being on this show.  The one tent sounds like it needs a construction crew.  Oh, yeah.  You want me to see if I can get them on?  Nah, I have to say, I don't think that'd be a good idea.  Yeah, yeah.  No, don't, don't, don't fuck with their, uh, charity.  Yeah.  If it was just DJ, let me tell you something.  If it was just two DJs in bed for some kind of promotion, like, until their sports team 
[02:16:30]  won or something like that, then I would say, you know, whatever.  Whatever anyone wants to do would be great.  But it, since it's a cancer, breast cancer charity event, uh, it kind of takes us out  of the mix.  You know what I mean?  And I, I actually, yeah.  I think they're actually doing this, uh, to raise money, but also because they want to  get their names out there and they're using breast cancer, which I find kind of disgraceful,  but the bottom line is it is a legitimate charity.  But, but yeah, try to spin that in the paper. 
[02:17:00]  Right.  Uh, when, when, when the headline is Opie and Dopey, uh, interfere with breast cancer  charity.  And, and then under that, didn't they learn?  Yeah.  Or will we do something like two boobs interfere with breast cancer thing.  That's what their, their headline would be.  I'm reading them in my head.  Headline from the future.  Joe.  Hi, I got a headline for you guys.  Breast cancer stunt gets radio boobs removed. 
[02:17:30]  All right.  All right, we're going to reboot.  When we get back, we got the monkey song, the anti-evolution song.  All right.  We have, uh, where's the restart button?  We got the Pastor Greg theme song.  We still haven't got into the bird flute thing.  There's a new, uh, Bond guy.  Yes.  He's blonde.  Wow.  We're making a big deal out of that.  Blonde Bond.  Who fucking cares?  Bond has been irrelevant since like 1978.  And then, uh, everything you know about sex is wrong. 
[02:18:00]  And why is that book so big?  It's like a big work book.  I assume we know more than we do.  Uh-huh.  Oh, so, yeah, we must not know a lot.  Zoofile.  What is it?  I don't know.  Well, I guess we'll be talking.  Is this a guy?  Who wrote this?  I'm going to tell you who edited this.  Why is the editor on the cover? 
[02:18:30]  I swear to you, this is the page I turned to?  Holy crap.  What page, sweetie?  118.  All right, let's turn to it.  It's titled Pervert by Jill Nagel.  He's on his stomach.  Nagel.  He's on his stomach, breathing slow.  What page?  118.  I thought I said that.  I couldn't get there.  I thought I said that.  I was never good at getting to the pages.  Like, in school, they would go page whatever, and I'd be, like, flipping like an idiot.  He's on his stomach, breathing slow.  I'm moving my hands over and over his back, kneading the knots out of tight muscles, 
[02:19:00]  smoothing the surface of his skin, feeling the occasional sprout of hair or random mole,  and then it happens.  When are you going to start reading?  The feeling overtakes me.  In that instant, I know there's no turning back.  From that moment on, I contrive to orchestrate all my movements to reach my goal without tipping  him off to the truth.  I pinch and press the skin all over his back, holding and twisting in many places, as if 
[02:19:30]  I meant to execute a special neuromuscular technique, so that when I press and wriggle  my thumbs around that special pore, he won't wonder why.  Dude, this is so disgusting.  It gets worse.  I can't even take this.  I found that long strokes of my fingers alongside the target area help to loosen the skin in  preparation for removal.  Removal?  In these circumstances, it's always a multi-phase process, with each step needing to be worked 
[02:20:00]  in around the, well, more expected activities.  What are they talking about here?  What is she going to do?  Irving writhes whenever I stroke his ass and tilts his large, white, hairy bun skyward.  I spank him lightly and he groans.  I yawn.  I don't know why I've never just come right out and asked someone, dude, can I pop the  zit on your back? 
[02:20:30]  Maybe it's because I'm afraid they'll say no.  Maybe it's because I love the challenge and the satisfaction I get of using my stealth  extraction skills undercover.  My breathing becomes labored as I pass the designated coordinates again and again, searching  for signs of readiness for the kill.  Suddenly, Irving turns his head up toward me.  I have to ask you something, he says.  My hands freeze.  Fuck.  Busted, I think.  Sure, Irving. 
[02:21:00]  What's up?  I've never had a woman, you know.  He pauses.  I know what's coming.  Fuck you up the butt?  I offer brightly.  His face reddens.  Uh, yeah.  As we ready ourselves for this deed, I'm pondering how to proceed with the important task at  hand.  It's not as, it's not as if I have no practice.  And then it goes on and on.  She likes to pop zits.  That's what she wants to do.  And he thought he was going to get a thumb in the ass.  Right.  Yep.  Disappointing.  So we'll talk to the author of this book after the break, I guess. 
[02:21:30]  What are some of the other titles?  Rules.  I guess he edited.  Necrophilia.  Edited this because it's a bunch of stories from other people.  Orgies.  The Circle Game.  Necrophilia.  Egg sex.  All right.  You know what?  This guy might turn out to be a good guest.  You never know.  We'll find out next.  Have Oprah mind the listeners, serious questions only.  And then E-Rock wrote back to Ben saying, trying to. 
[02:22:00]  Wow.  Hey, can we play Jim Norton's set on Jay Leno instead of taking a dumb break?  Do we have to take breaks today, Derek?  You don't really know?  All right.  Why don't we take a break by playing Jim Norton on Jay Leno Monday night?  I think that would be a lot cooler than hearing a bunch of promos for stuff we don't care about.  Or commercials.  Oh, we'd like some of our sponsors.  We have sponsors?  Huh? 
[02:22:30]  Ben, come here.  Come here.  Come here.  How many breaks do we have to take?  Just like Billy Bob Thornton.  Come here.  I can't see in that room today for some reason.  How many breaks do we have to take today?  Take all the breaks.  Sponsors.  A fixed lawnmower's down there.  Mm-hmm.  Casually.  All right, here's the deal.  Jim Norton was on Jay Leno on Monday night.  We're going to try to play your set, like, before the end of the show, okay?  Oh, dude, you've got to do the commercials.  Do them.  We have to play a regular break, but, uh... 
[02:23:00]  He's got the boy.  You don't need to hear things like that.  Mm-hmm.  Slingpen.  Say hi to Andy.  He kills Dwight by hitting him with his cock.  What are you going to do with that hog?  I guess I aims to kill you with it.  Andy.  Hey, Opie.  How you doing?  All right.  Good.  You fucked up once again.  The word is not riz.  It's rides.  How do you spell rides? 
[02:23:30]  Like W-R-I-T-H-E-S.  Did he say riz?  I didn't even catch that.  I missed it.  How did you catch that in that awful friggin' story?  How far down was that word?  Two knuckles.  Not halfway.  Bless you.  Yeah, I don't know.  I just thought I'd let you know.  All right.  Your grammar school teacher stinks.  I'm sorry.  Love you.  All right.  Your grammar school teacher stinks.  See you, guys.  All right. 
[02:24:00]  Let's say hi to Dale, the trucker.  Dale?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Good to see you, Jimmy.  Hey.  I just got a curiosity.  Where did the Ray Moan bit come from?  Oh, my God.  You're a new listener, aren't you?  Yeah, sir.  Yeah, I've only been listening for maybe a month or so.  Wow.  The reason I have...  It's a character in some of Steve's production work that he does.  Okay.  The reason I have is I was at a crapper at a truck stop in Louisiana the night before last.  Mm-hmm.  And the entire bathroom stall was like an homage to you guys. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, and then, and then two of them, too.  And, like, the whole wall was written, Ray Moan, bring me some TP, like, 2,000 times.  Ramon.  Yeah, we've got...  Put your lips by that glory hole.  We got a bunch of pests that happen to be truckers as well, and they have attacked the bathroom stalls across America.  We're getting reports all the time.  You guys got to take pictures so we can get it up on the website.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we'll do, guys.  Punch it out, man.  I love you.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Speaking of Ramon, let's say hi to Hank. 
[02:25:00]  Hank?  Ramon, mop up this malignant mess.  Oh, God.  All right.  With that, we're going to reboot.  Ben's hug is just big enough for my baby.  Well, I do have big tips, God damn it.  God damn it, what nice tips.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  What are you talking about? 
[02:25:30]  Let me see.  Look, I just...  Oh, yeah, well...  Holy shit!  It's all about me.  I never go to this site.  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program on this fine Whip them out Wednesday. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, my God.  You can get your wow stickers by going to opieandanthony.com.  Send in a self-addressed stamped envelope, and we'll send the wow stickers out to you.  The address should be somewhere on opieandanthony.com.  You sure that's not just opie.com?  Why?  Because I'm looking at the picture.  It's opieandanthony.com.  You go there, you see high voltage, and then you see this big picture of Opie's face, and  then I'm in the background, but you can only see half of me because I'm being covered by 
[02:26:30]  Opie's animated face.  You see how that hurts?  And now...  Like, there is no...  On the front page of opieandanthony.com, there is no real picture of me.  You cannot see it.  It is the animated picture.  I knew there was a reason I liked this website.  There was just something that felt good about this site.  You go there, and it's just...  Like, you can't even fit your whole face in the picture.  That's how big and close the picture is.  And I'm in the background, covered up by another picture of you. 
[02:27:00]  You gotta pay...  Oh, my God.  You really gotta start paying attention, Anthony.  Nah.  I know you do brilliant radio and all, but we've been using this website for a long time now.  I go right to Foundry, because it takes me hours to do anything on it, and I don't  want to waste any time on some convenience site.  You're just noticing what our website looks like.  That's a little scary.  Anyway, the Halloween party's coming up.  Halloween night, Hard Rock Cafe.  We got three bands playing. 
[02:27:30]  We got Brother Joe's 2U band, which is the U2 tribute band, which is unbelievable.  Do we have a sample of 2U today?  Where is the sample?  Let's listen to the sample.  So we got Brother Joe's U2 tribute band.  We also have a Rush tribute band and a ACDC tribute band.  It's going to be a great night at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Halloween night.  Here's the twist.  We're celebrating our first year at XM Satellite Radio.  We are the pioneers of satellite radio.  Absolutely.  And we're looking for people to come there with costumes that have something to do with 
[02:28:00]  this program.  Mm-hmm.  Ben's Hog.  You want to dress as Ben's Hog?  A lot of people are saying they're going to go as Ben's Hog.  What would you do that with?  Paper mache?  Or would you use some kind of flesh-covered material and hoops?  I don't know.  But you can make a Ben's Hog and wear it.  If Jimmy didn't have a mouthful of shit-producing cereal, he would probably have a brilliant line  right here.  He's eating some of that Kashi.  Kashi. 
[02:28:30]  Seven whole grain puffs.  No sugar whatsoever.  None.  Yeah.  Boy, the log, I got to tell you, not that anybody wants to sit up with the log, tapered and  lovely.  Do you know what we're doing on the show?  Yep.  I got a picture already.  Oh, you do now?  You do already?  Probably not that good one, but...  Wow.  I'm holding out.  I'm holding out.  I had one I thought was worth bringing to the table.  Mine's not that big.  Yesterday, but I'm going to hold out and see what I could make happen today.  I'm not even coming to the track unless I got a winning horse.  No way.  Not even taking a picture. 
[02:29:00]  Basically, the whole gang, we're taking a picture of our best dump of the week, and then  we're going to throw it up on a website, and then the listeners are going to  vote for the best dump.  Completely anonymous dumps, too.  You won't know who's is who's, so there can't be any favoritism.  Yeah, because they would all vote for Anthony.  No, they wouldn't.  Anthony's perfect.  They wouldn't.  Anthony never gets hate mail.  They would...  Yeah.  You get hate mail?  Oh, my God.  I never got any.  I can barely stand at this point.  I get mail just as we love you, and we're glad you're there, and, you know, please, 
[02:29:30]  every time Jimmy's there, I get...  I get...  I get dizzy.  Really?  Really?  From the hate mail.  All right.  Oh, God.  What is that?  What?  That's Danny's?  Jesus.  How are we going to beat that?  Let me see.  Oh, I can't look at it.  Are you cheating, Danny?  Danny's cheating.  Are you cheating?  Wait, is that the old one?  Oh, you got a new one?  You got a new one?  I just want to know what the prize is, so I can take it home. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, really?  You're feeling very confident.  I am.  With this one, I got one.  Hang on a second.  All right.  No, I got one better for you, Jimmy.  Why don't you clean your toilet, man?  Yeah, why don't you clean your toilet, man?  It's a mess.  I got better things to do.  All right.  You got a new one, though.  I do.  Who wants to see?  Is that the only entry?  Yeah.  It's like every food group is...  Wow.  Oh, let me see.  Show Anthony.  Every food group is represented in that picture.  It's a single log W.  Let me see.  Wow.  That's probably a one. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Did you place it in the bowl that way?  I swear to God, I didn't.  That is fantastic.  You could sell that to McDonald's.  What do you eat every day?  Like cookie dough and glue?  Well, no, I purposely ate, like, the wrong things to get this going.  He really wants to win this thing.  I've been eating Big Macs and Chinese food every day since last week.  What happened?  Jimmy's just disgusted.  Disgusted.  You're eating.  That is so cute. 
[02:31:00]  Anyone else have their entries, though?  Wow, that's going to be hard to beat.  They're not available to the listeners yet until we get everybody's.  No, no.  But so far, Danny has a really good one.  Okay, well, let's talk for another day.  A lot of people with costume ideas, I guess, for the Halloween party.  Yeah.  Tippy Tom.  A wizard with a rapier.  Dress up as a giant letter T and just keep falling down all night long.  Bob Kelly with a sink.  Big wiffle bat. 
[02:31:30]  Let's see.  A lot of people trying to dress up as Lil' Connor.  Right.  Wear a diaper and some seaweed.  Someone wants to dress up as a big packet of mayo.  Go as ONA's marketing team and just don't show up.  Very good.  Well, all right.  They're coming up with their ideas for the big costume contest.  Because we've got some fine prizes and cash prizes, I think, for the best costumes that night at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[02:32:00]  Halloween night.  And we're going to be giving out a free shirt.  Oh, wow, really?  Commemorating the one year on satellite radio.  My brother came up with a great design.  Oh, A, like meaning a lot.  Huh?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It sounded like there was a prize and it was a shirt.  A free shirt pretty much to everyone that shows up at the Hard Rock Cafe Halloween night.  And if you can't show up and you want one of these shirts anyway, you can go to opianthony.com and purchase one. 
[02:32:30]  There is a lot of confusion.  I've been getting emails and stuff.  A lot of confusion as to how you get into this event.  I guess you just show up.  Because there's a lot of out-of-state people that are just coming in for this event that are going,  you know, what if I fly in from L.A. and I don't get to come in.  Well, I thought we should, you know, maybe next week we should give away some tickets.  You want to give away some...  Some guarantees.  Guarantees.  Yes. 
[02:33:00]  That's a good idea.  Give away some guarantees.  I think we're going to go...  I don't know.  I don't know what the Hard Rock holds.  I'm thinking at least 600, 700 people.  Yeah.  There's going to be a line probably outside.  As people are leaving, they're going to let other people in, I'm sure.  That's how it usually works at these events.  Yeah.  But I think we need to give away some guaranteed tickets next week.  Yeah.  All next week we'll give out guaranteed tickets.  Yeah, we need that.  We need, like, a list to put people on so they can...  If they're flying in from somewhere.  But then they're going to be lying.  You're going to get people lying. 
[02:33:30]  Hi, I'm from fucking...  You've got to show your license.  Yeah, but they could be here.  They could be, but I mean, there's only so many ways to do it.  Yeah.  Well, Don Wicklund will figure it out.  Because he's brilliant.  Oh, right.  But anyway, if you want the t-shirt there, we'll give it out Halloween night.  It's really good.  My brother did a pretty good job.  A really good job on this one.  Has a lot of show references on the back.  You can go to opianthony.com and check out the t-shirt, and you can order one, I guess.  But everyone that goes to the party will get one for free. 
[02:34:00]  Okay.  Where's my Halloween shirt?  Yeah, he's going to want one.  Where were we?  Oh, we want to get this author on the...  Monkey song.  You want the monkey song first?  That's where we were about two hours ago.  All right.  How about evolution?  Oh, yes.  To you.  Oh, that's where we were.  That's what started this whole thing.  Right.  To you, Brother Joe's U2 tribute band will be playing, and we've got some studio stuff here.  Yeah.  Just a quick sample.  Just a quick sample.  Just a quick sample. 
[02:34:30]  Thank you. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, there's one on New Year's Day. Oh, well, there's one that gets underway. I want to be with you, be with you night and day. Nothing changes on New Year's Day. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, well, there's one on New Year's Day. Oh, well, there's one on New Year's Day. 
[02:36:00]  Great. I put on a really good show, too.  I actually met Journey's guitarist when I was in L.A. I thought it was a joke.  You did?  Yeah. I think it's him. He said he was. I don't know what he looks like, though.  Journey's new guitarist?  The guy who's been there for years, the original, I guess.  The original guitarist guy?  Neil Sean?  Neil.  Oh, his name is Neil?  Yeah.  Is there a Steve that plays guitar or no?  Steve Berg? 
[02:36:30]  I don't know.  No. Paul is emailing. No filter, Paul, about going, wanting to go. The last person we want within an atomic bomb blast radius of that charity event is no filter, Paul.  Yeah, not the right one. Do another one, like Assault on the Media.  Yeah. Well, Paul is the leader in the Assault on the Media contest for October.  Yeah, don't self-destruct, Paul. Don't get so eager you're self-destruct.  Yep.  We don't need it. We're frightened men. 
[02:37:00]  That's what happened with Paul Mercurio.  Don't pull a Mercurio.  You don't need it.  You're the leader of the Assault on the Media contest. Let's keep it at that.  Yeah, let this one go by.  And his clip is great.  Very funny.  It's on openanthony.com. He looks like a raving lunatic.  He should be doing every Assault on the Media. Just pop it out.  Todd Conner joins us live from New York Times Square. Todd?  Hey there, Greta. Mayor Michael Bloomberg spending his day defending his actions to make the threat public 
[02:37:30]  and also to flood the city's subways with thousands of police officers and extra security saying  he would rather err on the side of caution.  And of course, my subways also being rather cautious today.  Reporters reporting countless abandoned bags and other suspicious items.  You do hear the fuck, by the way.  The video's great. You've got to check it out.  It's just really funny.  And now that we know that whole thing was a hoax, I don't feel bad that we had a lot of attacks  during the subway reporting. 
[02:38:00]  I didn't feel bad at all.  There you go.  For a second.  All right, monkey song or author?  How about monkey song first? I mean, am I out of line?  Yeah, I want to hear monkey song.  Okay.  Cute little monkey song.  This is about, it's an anti-evolution song.  Give it a bell.  For the kids.  It's not even really a pro-creationism as much as it is anti-evolution.  They really want to pounce those facts down.  Give it a bell.  Well, so they got the kids singing the monkey song.  This fine anti-evolution song. 
[02:38:30]  Have we got any grease for the bell?  I don't want to burn the bearing out.  Stop.  You know what?  We're not going to play the monkey song.  We've got to play the monkey song.  Yeah, I think we can play it.  You've got to play the monkey song.  Yeah, why not?  People get the point.  It's just an anti-evolution song sung by kids.  It's no big deal.  Here's where you should play it.  Simply because this is going to stay in their dumb heads. 
[02:39:00]  There's no way you're shaking this one out of your head.  Yeah, it is catchy.  Look, we're running out of show.  I think they get the point and we can move on to other things.  No.  We have an hour, right?  Yeah, at least.  Yeah, I guess we have.  Back?  Yeah.  I'm no kin to the monkey.  No, no, no.  The monkey's no kin to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know much about his ancestors,  but mine didn't swing from a tree.  It seems so unbelievable. 
[02:39:30]  And yet they're saying it's true.  They're teaching us about it in school now.  That humans were monkeys once, too.  Oh, I'm no kin to the monkey.  No, no, no.  The monkey's no kin to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know much about his ancestors,  but mine didn't swing from a tree.  Although it's so ridiculous.  They're teaching us now that it's true.  The teachers that came from a monkey 
[02:40:00]  would be better off in a zoo.  Oh, I'm no kin to the monkey.  No, no, no.  The monkey's no kin to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know much about his ancestors,  but mine didn't swing from a tree.  It seems so much more believable.  And surely, surely it's true  that God made man in his image.  No monkey's story will do.  Oh, I'm no kin to the monkey.  No, no, no. 
[02:40:30]  The monkey's no kin to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know much about his ancestors,  but mine didn't swing from a tree.  This monkey business has to go  because it just isn't true.  It's such a disgrace to the monkey.  A disgrace to the human race, too.  Whoa, I'm no kin to the monkey.  No, no, no.  The monkey's no kin to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know much about his ancestors,  but mine didn't swing from a tree. 
[02:41:00]  Mine didn't swing from a tree.  Mine didn't swing from a tree.  All that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel.  What the?  Who the?  It was the wrong bank.  Here it is.  We're tanks for nothing!  That's the one that was supposed to play,  not the Blazing Saddles clip.  What the?  Jesus.  Why don't we get these things filed properly  so those errors don't happen in the future? 
[02:41:30]  So, uh, there we go.  I'm no kin to the monkey.  No, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no.  Is it no, no, no?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  The monkey's no kin to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm no kin to a monkey.  That's what I figure.  I'm no kin to a monkey.  Well, and then it just goes on and on.  There's the monkey song.  The anti-evolution song. 
[02:42:00]  It's sung by kids.  Oh, that's kind of cute.  Oh.  I'm no kin to the monkey.  No, no, no.  I don't want you to think that I'm a kook.  Oh, I'm no...  You know, you can just probably do whatever you want to do.  Yeah, yeah.  It's cute, though.  It's catchy.  Yeah.  You got little children singing like that.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I'm no kin to the monkey.  Bah, bah, bah.  I don't have a bigger brother. 
[02:42:30]  Let's get the author on the phone.  Oh, all right.  I mean, sometimes you just let the listeners write their own jokes.  Ah.  Everything you know about sex is wrong.  The disinformation guide to the extremes of human sexuality and everything in between.  Mm.  All right.  No, no, no.  Psst.  Did you hear the one about the explicit Twin Towers sex scene deleted from a 9-11 novel?  What?  How circumcision hurts your sex life. 
[02:43:00]  I buy that.  Uh, the world's largest erotic archive.  287,000 movies that no one is allowed to see.  FAA reports about people screwing on commercial flights.  The Mile High Club.  The frisky behavior of nuns and priests.  The photo of Jesus and the adulteress that Hustler wouldn't run.  The proof that sex and orgasms make you healthy. 
[02:43:30]  The amazing powers of the vagina in history and mythology.  Bop-bop-bop-bop.  The big, easy, boom.  The unexpected sexiness of blood, chest, food, pimples, and bee stings.  Where are the motherfucking copters?  The new legends.  Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Let's say hi to the author of this fine book.  Just ask them about the curfew.  Um, Russ! 
[02:44:00]  Yes.  Hey, Russ, how you doing?  Welcome to the Greg and Tony show.  How are you today, sir?  Doing pretty good.  All right, you got this book out, huh?  Oh, yeah.  We've been enjoying your book, sir.  Yeah, did you read it?  That's right.  A little, might I say, a little risque.  Oh, just a little, yeah.  Just a bit.  A couple of things kind of spun my hat around a couple of times.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean.  Oh, yeah.  Everything you know about sex is wrong. 
[02:44:30]  Russ?  Yeah.  That's the title of the book.  Yes, just to let you know, we do a very family-oriented radio show here,  so we've got to keep it kind of between the lines, if you know what I mean.  Oh, is that right?  Well, when we were approached by our producer about having you on with this book,  we kind of, we were a little leery about it, to tell you the truth,  because it is very explicit, and this is a family-oriented show,  and we were trying to figure out how to actually touch on some of the subjects.  Okay, well, tell me what you've figured out. 
[02:45:00]  How can we touch on this?  Well, why did you put this book out?  What were you hoping to gain?  Oh, let's see.  Well, I've been doing all these anthologies for the disinformation company.  Hey, that's not a bad word, is it?  Anthology.  You know.  Go ahead, Russ.  Go ahead.  Well, I've been doing these anthologies for the disinformation company in New York,  and, you know, we've been doing kind of unthemed ones. 
[02:45:30]  They just were all over the map.  They covered sex, but they also covered current events.  Right.  You know, all kinds.  You know, but the angle always was things that are, you know, controversial or hidden,  stuff like that.  And so we decided it was time to do a themed one.  And what better theme than sex?  I mean, there's just so much.  Sex sells, doesn't it, there?  Yeah, but there's such a preoccupation with sex in this country, I think. 
[02:46:00]  And I think it might be hurting our children.  What do you think, Russ?  What do you think?  No, I don't think so.  I think kids are going to be just fine somehow.  Let me ask you a question, Russ, because you're talking about, like, a lot of the popular myths  that might be wrong, but do you think that a lot of what kind of goes into pop culture  as far as whether it's a sexual intonation or writhing around or things of that nature, 
[02:46:30]  I mean, do you think that kind of contributes, or is that basically what a lot of people would  say is a non-factor?  Oh, very good.  Oh, well, I'd say it's kind of a mix.  I mean, popular culture does, you know, keep some of these myths going.  And, but in some other ways, I think...  No, but I mean, like, no, no, I'd probably rephrase that.  I mean, like, in the direct contrast to what is normally considered relative sexually. 
[02:47:00]  That's normally considered what?  Like relative as far as sexuality is concerned.  Exactly.  Because what I'm saying is, like, a lot of what happens in pop culture, people look at  and they say, well, that's not really relative.  So what I'm saying is, can you make a direct connection, or do you think that it kind of  deviates from what people would normally expect, but not, you know?  Oh, so you mean, does it really apply to, like, what people are doing?  Well, yeah, yeah, because what happened...  I actually was, I was, I was leaping through it, and there was some very interesting things  here, like things that you think or things that aren't true. 
[02:47:30]  And I've always found that, like, what popular belief will sometimes go against the grain,  and yet it's not completely or totally incorrect, but by not different standards, if, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Well, sure, sometimes, yeah, there can be a grain of truth and...  No, no, no, no, no, but I'm talking about with...  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on, I lost the page here.  I'm sorry, buddy.  There it is.  Wait, hold on.  Wait, wait, no, no.  That's...  You have the book in front of you? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  118.  118?  Yes.  What is this, pervert about a girl?  This is actually, it was kind of...  What I liked about this pervert story is it's going one way, but then it goes another.  Yeah, this is actually about, it's written by a woman who gets this erotic charge out  of popping pimples. 
[02:48:30]  But I got to, here's what I got to ask.  Wow.  Here's what I got to ask you.  Mm-hmm.  How much of this would you say is, is it fact, or is it like, are these like, this is what  I was saying about, like, relativity and pop culture.  Are these things kind of things that really happen, or did you just kind of hunt it out  and find it?  Well, everything in the book, it's all non-fiction.  It actually happened.  Or at least, you know, that's what the people who wrote it are saying. 
[02:49:00]  But now, does she, does she get, like, a real thrill out of popping the zits?  That's what she says, yeah.  How do you know?  It's kind of a turn-off.  And what really grabbed me about this particular essay is that I've actually known women, have  been involved with two women who had the same kind of thing.  Wait, hold on.  Dude, that page, women do love popping. 
[02:49:30]  Hold on.  What page is this?  130?  118.  Yeah, 118 is the, uh...  Yeah, that's, uh...  I read that one, and I've got to tell you, I was a little put off.  I was a little put off.  Uh, but I can't imagine there's a woman out there that would, uh, enjoy this kind of thing.  Well, yeah, there is.  I mean, this is, it's not only her turn-on, but I've actually known two women who like this, too. 
[02:50:00]  Um, now, do you find that, is it the fact that they're, like, popping zits, or is it something  like, where you, like, deal with, like, uh, kind of like a pleasure-pain thing, but yet,  when you're looking at it from another point of view, it's kind of like, well, I'm going  to take this one thing and go in the opposite direction, because, you know, I mean, it's like  there's a whole book about, you know, if not from that.  Well, that's, I don't know, that's a good question, and exactly what, you know, what she gets 
[02:50:30]  out of it is kind of left for the readers to die.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Hey, uh, I want to get, let's get, let's dive into some terminologies here I'm getting  from the book, and, uh, see if you can't clear some of these things up.  Uh, and try to keep it a little clean.  What, what is, uh, 126?  Okay.  What is queening?  Okay, that is, uh, more of a popular activity in Europe and Britain, and that's where a woman 
[02:51:00]  will actually sit on a man's head.  Oh, easy now, easy now, Russ.  I just, I want to know what this is, but, you know, like I said earlier, please, let's,  let's keep this civilized, uh, queening.  Uh-huh.  Well, that, that's it, but there's...  Just her sitting on, now, that doesn't sound very shocking.  Yeah, you do that when you're a kid, you wrestle around, you have pillow fights.  A little sitting on the head, that's fine. 
[02:51:30]  You're rocking around the back of the van, he comes back.  Anything else involved with queening?  No, actually, that's the interesting thing, is that it doesn't involve, uh, what you might  think it would involve.  Ah.  All right, how about a cidophilia?  Yeah, that, that's just a general term that applies to any way that you can use food for  a sexual purpose.  And I think, you know, the most obvious way would be, you know, bananas and cucumbers 
[02:52:00]  and these kind of things.  What?  Let's go to page 120, Anthony.  120.  Hold on.  What is cabaza?  Ah, yes, that, well, let's see, how do you keep this clean?  Yeah, please, please.  Actually, it's, uh, it's a bring your kids to work day here today, and I have my young son  here in this studio with me, so if you could please keep, uh, this, um, you know, above 
[02:52:30]  board.  Page 120?  Yeah, cabaza.  I don't have that one.  Oh, 125.  I don't have that either.  118 to 145, it goes.  Yeah, cabaza is where a woman has developed the ability to, uh, to grip.  Grip.  With, yeah, with her, uh, five-year-old.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute now.  To grip with the private area.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:53:00]  Grip what?  Grip with, like, uh, uh, could she, could she bring me a beer?  Ha, ha, you know, like bring me a beer or something.  Cover your ears, son.  Cover your ears.  We're having fun like men talk here today.  Hey, we don't have the hole in here with us today.  Betty Hole, she's our co-host usually.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah, yeah.  But we just call her the hole.  Still there, Russ? 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Any other terms that you're interested in?  Yeah, I'm fascinated with some of the terminology in this book, but I'm just thumbing through it right now.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, there she is.  The hole.  Well, what about page 120?  Let me get to that one.  I've always been bad with finding page numbers, Russ. 
[02:54:00]  Explain that before.  Oh, jeez, look at the title of this.  I can't say that.  How do we explain this, Russ?  That's a good question.  Let's see how good you are at doing radio.  Wow.  Well, let's see.  It was written by a woman who used to do phone sex professionally.  Right.  And she noticed, you know, they were, the phone sex company had their ads in the back of Hustler and Gallery. 
[02:54:30]  Uh-huh.  Men's Magazine.  Uh-huh.  And she started noticing that a lot of men were calling and wanting her to give them these fantasies that involved other men.  You know you're right.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Well, Betsy does agree.  Okay.  Well, so...  I'm trying to figure out how we can really get a little more detailed without going over that line. 
[02:55:00]  You know what I mean?  Just call it...  Oh, yeah.  I know what you mean.  Just call it the sea sucker magnet.  Oh.  Come on.  Stop.  We're...  Don't worry, Betsy.  Guys!  I can't take this.  I...  I gotta say you gotta stop.  Yeah.  We just said sea sucker magnet.  That's all.  You guys have to stop.  Yeah, Betsy gets a little annoyed.  So what is that about?  Well, yeah, it's about the phone sex woman who noticed that lots of men... 
[02:55:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, now Betsy, let him finish the story.  He hasn't said anything dirty yet.  Go ahead, sir.  I'm sorry.  Well, yeah, all these men were calling.  Apparently...  Now, now, now, hold on.  All right, hold on.  Two seconds.  Take me off the air, L.P.  Take me off the air.  Hey.  Yeah.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Shut the fuck up and let the guy talk.  Fucking bitch. 
[02:56:00]  I put me back on.  Hey, Russ.  How you doing?  I'm sorry.  All right.  Betsy...  Yeah, we have a little tension here in the studio sometimes, and Betsy gets a little out of hand,  but, uh, so now this C, I can't even say it, uh, magnet, uh, is about a phone sex, uh, thing?  Yeah, it's written by a woman who used to do this professionally.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, no, come on.  Hey, Betsy, let Russ talk, okay?  Okay? 
[02:56:30]  Betsy?  And she noticed that all these guys calling in, well, a lot of them, a lot more than she ever would have thought,  were wanting these fantasies.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I have to apologize for, um, Betsy talking over you.  Anytime we try to...  You know, we've tried to bring a little bit of, um, sensuality into the program, uh, because we're so, uh, mainstream.  But, uh, Betsy really doesn't enjoy this. 
[02:57:00]  And, uh, we just have to, uh, acclimate her to, uh, what's going on in the world.  Hey, enter this century, right?  Boo.  Right, yes.  All right, some of the other, uh, terminology, uh, dogging.  What is dogging?  Now, you wouldn't think that's, um, uh, what it would, uh, uh, sound like.  Mm-hmm.  No, no, no, you wouldn't.  Uh-huh.  This is actually women and men who, who go parking in, you know, public areas. 
[02:57:30]  Uh-huh.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The catch is, they want to be cool.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hey, hey, oh, hold on, what, just, what, yeah, put, pull me off one more time.  Just pull me off the air one more time.  Okay, I'm sorry, Russ.  I'm sorry.  Betsy, I will stick this fucking bat up your fucking ass!  Now, knock it off!  Conducting a fucking interview, you cunt! 
[02:58:00]  All right, I'm sorry, Russ.  Continue.  Dogging.  Okay, yes.  Um, the catch is...  Something funny, Russ.  Something funny, Russ?  Oh, no, no.  All right, continue.  But the catch with dogging is the people in the cars...  Come on, stop.  ...want you to look in...  Come on, stop.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  So, it's actually...  Guys, I can't take this...  Right.  I gotta say, you gotta stop.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:58:30]  Okay, well, I've stopped.  I...  I...  This is really uncomfortable.  I'm very uncomfortable, and I'm somewhat embarrassed here, Russ.  I apologize.  You know something, Betsy?  Let's just go to the phones, because I...  All right, let's just go to the phones.  Uh, Steve.  Steve from Yellowstone.  We are a national program.  You're on the phone with Russ Kick, author of the book, Everything You Know About Sex 
[02:59:00]  Is Wrong.  Hello, Russ.  How are you?  I'm doing fine.  I'm sorry, too.  I'm a little bit nervous.  I've never been on the radio before.  Hello?  That's okay.  That's okay, Steve.  You're on with Russ Kick.  I was looking at a little piece of your thing, and sometimes I like to drink, and I'll get  way too drunk to do any type of functioning or production work, and I wanted to know, why  does alcohol sometimes affect my sexual performance?  Anything in your book about alcohol and sex? 
[02:59:30]  A lot of times, because I get yelled at, because a lot of times I'll go out for sushi dinners,  and I'll just cry inappropriately, and I'll just basically cause a problem.  Yeah, well, alcohol is actually known for dampening sexual ability, so...  This guy's book is bullshit. 
[03:00:00]  Excuse me?  This guy's circle jerks with children.  This guy jerks off reading Adam Blasch-Taste transcripts.  My goodness.  Ramon! 
[03:00:30]  This guy has AIDS and is kin to a monkey.  I really want to apologize for our caller.  Sometimes they get out of hand, as you can tell, Russ.  I'm going to hang up on Steve from Yellowstone.  Obviously, that was some type of prank.  Prank call, prank call.  We get those from time to time.  I'm sorry, Russ. 
[03:01:00]  No problem.  I don't know him.  Prank caller, prank caller.  Are nuns and priests having sex?  You discuss that in the book.  Maybe we should get into that, because that's a hot topic these days.  Well, yes, actually, they are.  Yeah.  Now you're treading on sacred ground, Russ.  Oh, yeah.  Well...  Have you gotten any flack from the church because of this?  No, not yet.  Now, what are they doing?  How are they doing it?  Where? 
[03:01:30]  It doesn't seem like you could just, you know, be in the church.  Oh!  Well, actually, yes, there is a time-honored tradition of sex in churches.  Really?  Yes.  You know you're right.  Mm-hmm.  But, yeah, there was a survey done in the 70s of nuns and priests.  Yes.  They found out that 15% of them at least admitted to actually getting it on while they were nuns and priests. 
[03:02:00]  That's a...  Yes!  Yes, yes, yes.  She seems to know a lot about everything, doesn't she?  Professor Betsy, we call her around here.  Miss Know-It-All.  Oh, come on!  Yes, yes, yes.  Wow, that's fascinating.  I never knew that.  That is something I didn't know about sex, that priests and nuns.  Well, Tony, the phones have exploded.  We've got Eric Logan on the line here wants to talk to Russ Kick, the author. 
[03:02:30]  Eric!  Hey!  Hey, Eric!  Guys, can I talk to the author?  Yeah, you're on with Russ Kick.  Hi, Mr. Kick.  On the air.  Hi.  Hi, I'm Eric from Logan.  How are you?  Doing fine.  Um, you know, I was reading a book about sex, and, you know, if you write about sex, people  will read it.  Yeah, have you found that, that the sexual subject really does touch a lot of people?  They want to learn more about it?  Well, I hope so.  Ramon! 
[03:03:00]  Finger this guy's asshole with a Freddy Krueger glove.  Ramon!  Bring me, Pastor Greg!  I believe that's the same caller as before.  Ramon!  This guy has the sex appeal of Arthur Ashe's paper cut. 
[03:03:30]  Ramon!  This guy is as sexy as breast cancer.  Where'd you go?  Alright, listen.  If we can't get our phone screened properly, then, uh, we're gonna have to get a new staff  over there, okay?  If you couldn't tell that was the same person from earlier, uh, maybe you need to go back  to a phone screener school.  Because now I'm just steamed. 
[03:04:00]  I'm really, I have to apologize, Russ.  Um, your book is fantastic.  I've been, uh, reading, I've had it on the night table, uh, for the past few nights, and  it's fascinating reading, and I love it.  Oh, thank you.  And we want to thank you so much for, um, spending a little time with us, and, uh, sharing, uh,  everything you know about sex is wrong.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, just come on. 
[03:04:30]  Don't just, okay.  Yeah, uh, in, in closing, uh, where can we get this book?  Oh, it's on Amazon, and it's making its way into bookstores across the country.  Do you find that the reaction to it has been, uh, uh, would you say it's a reaction that,  like, kind of you subliminally expected, or would you say that it's more, um, on a level  with people going, well, you know, I mean, come on, I mean, how much are we supposed to  take with, with, with whatever it is, you know?  Well, actually, the book was just printed, so I haven't gotten much feedback at all yet, 
[03:05:00]  except, of course, from your, from your interesting caller there.  When's it go on sale?  Oh, it's actually, it's starting to go on sale right now.  Yeah.  Now Betsy's really contributing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tearing that ass up. 
[03:05:30]  Betsy sometimes, Russ, likes a fat fucking cock right up her asshole.  Till she gets in a gestion.  Oh, shit.  Where'd he go?  Oh.  Holy fucking Ramon.  God damn it, you fucking kill me with this.  I love the, uh, the.  There go the books.  Oh, no. 
[03:06:00]  That's heavy.  I love the, uh, the, the, the clips with the chick, that was great.  Oh.  It was really funny.  Oh, guys.  Wow.  Well, that went well.  I think we learned a lot.  All right.  Let's, let's, uh, let's, oh, can we play the, uh, the Jim Norton thing now?  Well, if you have to go to break, you. 
[03:06:30]  No, let's do that, and then we'll go to break, all right?  Ooh, breaks are fine.  Our own Jim Norton, he's only in town for, uh, the rest of this week, and then he goes  to L.A. for another two weeks or so, right?  Two, three weeks?  Well, it's only one week because you guys are off the second week, and I'm back there.  Oh, so you're only gone, you're only gone for two weeks?  I have one more three-week trip.  The rest of them are all two-week trips.  Are you going to be at the Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe, Halloween night?  Yes, I will.  Yes.  Okay, so Jim Norton's here through Friday, and then he goes back out to L.A.  He was on Jay Leno this Monday night and absolutely killed, and just in case you missed it,  we want to play that here, okay? 
[03:07:00]  Ooh.  Right.  All righty.  Thanks, guys.  Very funny comedian, starring in his own one-night-stand comedy special on HBO, which premieres October  21st every morning.  You can hear him on the, uh, Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  It's the hottest show there is.  Please welcome Jim Norton, ladies and gentlemen.  Thanks, everybody.  Uh, it's good to be back.  How are you?  How are you?  I'm actually spending, uh, a lot of time in L.A. now, and, uh, I'm lonely, man. 
[03:07:30]  I don't meet a lot of women.  And one of the main reasons is I have really bad sinuses.  You don't realize how disgusting you sound until you see that look on somebody else's face.  I don't even realize I'm doing it.  It's like, hey, can I get you a drink?  And I don't know what turns a girl off more is the sniffle or the swallow that comes right 
[03:08:00]  after it.  I spent about two hours today, uh, looking at photos of myself.  Not good.  I've never photographed well, and I finally realized why.  It's because cameras are accurate.  I'm not a good smiler.  Like, some people can just smile on cue, but for me, it has to happen naturally and organically.  Like, you know, maybe you're out in a mall, you see a very old person tumble face-first 
[03:08:30]  down an escalator.  Only natural a smile should pop out.  But when somebody tells me to do it, I think it's my shame, but I just kind of smirk and  slouch, and I don't mean to do it, but someone's like, smile, and I always go.  Every time I'm photographed, I look like an athlete should be visiting me in a hospital. 
[03:09:00]  I always hate when I'm online talking to a girl in a chat room, and she's like, send  a picture.  I'm like, well, that's the end of this conversation.  And I hate, like, the chat room lingo, like that little abbreviation people use, LOL, laughing  out loud.  Are you?  Because it used to be a natural expression to kind of make a mechanical conversation seem  more real, but now it's this, like, anchor at the end of every lame, uncomfortable online 
[03:09:30]  moment.  I use it myself.  You ever try to get somebody to talk dirty?  You got to throw LOL in there just in case they get angry.  Like a woman says something totally innocent, like, ah, that sucks.  And you type back, well, sucking isn't always bad, LOL.  Just in case she gets mad.  You're like, oh, no, I'm just laughing out loud.  I mean, I'm not sweating with my pants around my ankles typing lefty.  I'm not a good flirt. 
[03:10:00]  My idea of flirting is walking into a really crowded club and standing an inch behind a  girl and tickling the back of her arm and whispering, coochie, coochie, coo.  Some things are creepy only in context.  Like, I happen to lick my lips to moisten them.  Sometimes that's acceptable.  Other times, disgusting. 
[03:10:30]  You're talking to somebody and they're like, hey, how are you?  And you're like, yeah, I'm a little tired.  That's not bad.  But it's a different story.  If you're talking to someone and they're like, yeah, my daughter just left for school  and you go, really, how old is she?  I'm insecure around women.  You know what part of my body I really hate, besides my torso, neck, and chin? 
[03:11:00]  My feet are a genetic abomination.  Size seven and a half.  Triple E width.  That's almost a perfect square.  Normally, the only way to get feet like that is for a duck to impregnate a Lego person.  And I had a foot injury recently. 
[03:11:30]  I twisted my ankle and I didn't want to go to the doctor because I had this irrational  fear of the medical profession, like I'm going to go for a twisted ankle and find out  I have syphilis.  But I've always had really, really bad pain in my feet.  So I finally went to see somebody and he goes, oh, I see the problem.  Your left leg is a little longer than your right leg.  Oh, that's a relief.  Thank God it's not a muscle pull.  Nice to know it's only a mild skeletal deformation.  And now I'm completely self-conscious. 
[03:12:00]  Because you know you have something wrong with you.  You feel like everybody else can see it.  So I'm talking to a woman, but the whole time I'm talking to her internally, I feel like,  oh, can I buy you a drink?  I forgot my burlap mask with the eye hole cutting it.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  Oh, very funny stuff, but that's okay. 
[03:12:30]  I'll get another water.  Oh, is that yours?  No, don't worry about it.  I'll just throw this away right now.  Sorry about that.  Oh, no, no problem.  Well, congratulations.  You got a TV series.  Tell me about that.  It's actually, it's a sitcom on HBO called Lucky Louie.  I'm not the star.  But I have a great part.  I play like a really creepy, ill-informed pervert.  Wow.  It's, every week my script comes, it just says, show up. 
[03:13:00]  I'm not a good actor.  I mean, on this, I'm fine.  Oh, you're terrific, by the way.  You really are.  Thank you.  But I don't get nervous doing stand-up.  It's so weird.  Acting is like, I tend to panic when I'm acting, and I overdo it.  Yeah.  You always tell, like, when a comic's nervous acting, because my eyes bug out. 
[03:13:30]  It's like, where you going, Bob?  Oh, I suck.  Sometimes I read little stage directions in parentheses.  Where you going, Bob?  Looks at Bob.  And the hardest part of acting, I've always found, is listening.  It's really hard to, like, listen.  That's how you connect in a scene, is you listen. 
[03:14:00]  But I'm so worried I'm going to forget my dialogue.  Like, I don't listen to the other actor.  So there's no connection.  The whole time they're talking, all I'm thinking is, not my turn, not my turn, not my turn.  And then when it's my turn, you know, I bug out.  Act, act, act, act.  Not my turn.  Not my turn.  Well, it sounds like you have a fine career ahead of you.  Well, Jim, very funny.  Again, once again, I'll be in the Anthony Show on XM Radio, and, of course, on One Night's  Down on HBO on the 21st.  Thanks so much, guys.  Good job, buddy.  Thank you. 
[03:14:30]  All right, be right back with The Killers right after this.  Come on in, you guys.  Cara, Jim.  I want to find my guest, Jim Norton, on HBO and the opening Anthony Show.  Thank you very much, Cara Knightley.  Stay tuned for Conan.  Coming up next.  Good night, everybody.  I will do you Whip Em Out Wednesday. 
[03:15:00]  I will do you Whip Em Out Wednesday.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony program.  Greetings.  Greetings, yes.  Greetings.  Are we going to get into the little Marky thing?  Oh, yeah.  Marky, we've got to get Steve back in here.  That would definitely...  You've heard the little Marky songs on our show. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  High up the religious thing.  Yeah, they teach religious lessons, I guess, to kids, and I don't know.  It turns out this guy's a real, like, performer.  Mark Foxx or something.  This guy is such a tool.  I don't know where to name it.  This guy is shogi.  Hey, why don't you tell me?  He really looks and comes off like a gay gentleman.  Well, yeah.  He's got all the attributes of one of those really religious, uptight, gay gentlemen. 
[03:16:00]  It's how I have perceived him.  He's definitely religious and uptight.  Gay, I don't know, because I think he's married.  At least there's...  Well, who knows?  Beard.  Could be a beard.  But, yeah, this video surfaced last night, and the cover of his Live in Miami VHS tape surfaced.  VHS.  Yeah.  It's right on the cutting edge.  From 1991.  From 1991.  And, yeah, this video hit last night of him performing a song as Mark Foxx and Little Marky.  It's called Fearfully and Wonderfully Made. 
[03:16:30]  Now, he's in a church.  Yeah.  Up on the stage, whatever, altar, stage area.  All of the churchgoers that they're watching, and he's singing a song.  And then all of a sudden, he breaks into that Marky voice and does a duet with his regular singing voice.  Right.  Does everyone remember Little Marky?  Oh, Little Marky was the...  With Mommy, Why Did You Kill Me?  Right.  It was the Diary of an Unborn Fetus.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was the one.  Well, he sings, he's a fat gentleman, has a look, I don't know, some more... 
[03:17:00]  John Candy-ish, it's almost.  Yeah, it's between John Candy and...  Louie Anderson?  Louie Anderson.  But he's got, like, a mullet.  Well, it was 1991, right?  Oh, it was.  You've got to give that to him, I guess.  All right.  Does he have a wacky hat in this picture?  Yeah, it looks like he's got one of those old LL Cool J style hats, if that's what it is.  I don't know, I can't tell.  He's got smart slacks on.  He certainly does. 
[03:17:30]  Slacks, very smart.  And he's just strutting around on the stage.  And then when he goes into the Marky voice, he makes faces.  Oh, you've seen the video?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we just got it last night.  We just got the...  Is it up on Foundry?  Yeah, the video of this song.  The whole video I'm trying to get, I'm trying to find people who might know where to get  this, because there isn't that much information on Mark Fox available.  I'm trying to track down his actual contact information from a company he used to work for.  But outside of that, I mean, there's very limited information.  This is the first photo of this guy we've actually seen.  Stuff like this is so frightening. 
[03:18:00]  He's so extreme into the religion that it's scary, reaches that scary point.  Like that whole, why did you kill me, mommy?  Is so twisted.  Does he write this stuff?  Is he like the author?  Of these songs?  No.  No?  No.  There's actually writing credits on those.  But it's the whole, it's that whole Christian pop culture thing that, you know, is all over  the South.  It doesn't really have much presence up here.  And the song's all about, like, fear and, like, sacrifice. 
[03:18:30]  And it's never about fun.  No.  That whole Christian sitcom thing talking about earlier.  It's just, it couldn't possibly work because religion is never, ever about fun.  It's self-righteous.  And self-righteous is never funny.  It's about hurt, it's about sacrifice, it's about fear, pain, retribution.  There's never anything good.  Supposedly, the good stuff is supposed to come after you drop dead. 
[03:19:00]  That's when you get your payout.  That's when you get the jingling and the tray at the slot machine.  But in the meantime, it's nothing fun.  There's no fun.  This is really no fun.  Okay.  It does somehow.  It's a day, once around the corner.  Imagine what this day will bring. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, it is?  Sunshine, blue skies, cloudy day or rain.  Blue skies, old skies, situations change.  When the Lord takes your day, it puts you to the day.  This is the market.  What's left but to say, it's a new day.  That's the Pastor Greg theme song. 
[03:20:00]  That's the theme song to the Pastor Greg show?  We found that as well, so.  It's a new day, a non-Jew day.  Your ball's a blue day.  Wow, that is really bad, too.  Yeah.  But we got the Mark Fox.  You want to hear some of this?  No.  Featuring Lil Marky.  Lil Marky.  He just changes in the middle of the singing.  Yeah.  Steve, you said earlier that the guy disappeared.  Well, the last information I can find of him is from 2003, and that's when he was still 
[03:20:30]  doing gigs for kids.  I'm sure he's wearing a sweater with a rifle outside an abortion clinic somewhere in bushes.  I was going to say he finally blew his brains out.  Well, maybe.  I'm going to try.  Apparently, he was doing gigs with his wife.  Oh, dude, I heard he, like, joined Marilyn Manson.  Like, he freaked out, man.  Hey, crash comes where a crash is deserved.  There's three things at the same time there.  You were trying to say something.  He's doing the car crash, and I started the song. 
[03:21:00]  I was crashing myself.  You started Mark.  All at the same time.  None of us listened.  What?  But the fact is, we've been made by God in his love and in his image.  And Lil Marky and I will sing a very special song.  I've been fearfully, wonderfully made.  What theme song is he ripping off?  It sounds like an 80s sitcom.  That's like a TV theme song.  What?  Did he say fearfully?  Fearfully and wonderfully made.  Fearfully.  Yeah.  There's like... 
[03:21:30]  It's a common theme in these.  It's a common theme with this guy, too.  Yeah.  Like, the whole Marky thing and everything.  Right.  It's all fear.  Just be scared.  What's the common jet ripped off from, Lil Marky?  Dun, dun, dun.  But the fact is, we've been made by God in his love and in his image.  And Lil Marky and I will sing a very special song.  I've been fearfully...  Exciting and new.  It sounds like the love boat.  I will praise you.  Crying fearfully made.  Oh, it's from a game show.  All my days, you... 
[03:22:00]  Yes, it's from a game show.  It's called Hat or Hanger.  Hat or Hanger.  Oh, I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  Oh!  Can we play the song?  Okay.  I am fearfully made.  All my days, you planned for me. 
[03:22:30]  And I'll always be a sacrifice of praise.  Crying fearfully and wonderfully made.  When I was made in secret, you saw me yet informed.  You planned my days long before I knew them.  You hear and understand me.  You know my every thought.  Your skillful hand has made me who I am.  I will praise you.  Crying fearfully made.  Wow. 
[03:23:00]  How many people are watching this?  Five?  Six, maybe?  No, the audience has about...  Oh, you see the audience?  From what I saw, it was about, what, a hundred?  It could be a couple hundred people.  I mean, it's, you know, this looks like...  This was filmed in Miami, so there's probably a huge Christian...  Are they tapping their feet?  What are they doing?  You don't really see exactly what their feet are doing,  but it's a pretty packed house.  So, before you're even born, like, all your days are planned out.  Mm-hmm.  God, like, penciled in everything you're going to do.  There's nothing.  He's watching you every move. 
[03:23:30]  Every move, every thought.  That's a little scary.  Yep.  I've jacked off to some sick shit.  Yes.  I hope he wasn't taking a peek in my skull during that stuff.  You think God writes a little calendar,  and the people at Jim Beam saw Steve's calendar and got all excited?  Open a new factory, boys.  We'll praise you.  You'll be drinkin' till you drop.  I was fearfully and drunkly pulled over.  Did God plan your little pouch-like stomach? 
[03:24:00]  I wonder.  The itinerary of Steve.  It's a changed purse.  You can hold a little sippy juice and vellamint.  Vellamint.  From your wacky hair and big hog, I will praise.  Slam your face in what looks like sugar, then come in and talk for an hour.  All right. 
[03:24:30]  Lil Marky's about to sing here, guys.  Lil Marky is about to join the song.  Thank God.  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  Here's this fat fuck up on stage doing this voice, though, in front of everybody. 
[03:25:00]  Football.  Football.  It can always be a sacrifice to praise. 
[03:25:30]  Try and fearfully and wonder-free.  Mom!  I will praise you.  Mom was sleeping.  Dad woke her up by poking his heart on into her back.  The fear part came in, because if her legs stay closed, we'd knock her teeth out once again.  Dad won't fall out.  He says you'll take it in the womb.  All my days, you have planned for me, and I'll always be a sacrifice to praise. 
[03:26:00]  For I am fearfully and wonder-free, me.  I am fearfully and wonder-free, me.  Yeah!  Yep.  Liar, roar, liar, roar.  You know it.  You can get a doggy style.  You can get a lean on your side.  Those are your only choices.  This is my house, and I get to sing. 
[03:26:30]  All right.  Well, there it is.  There it is.  Mark Fox.  And Lil' Marky.  Lil' Marky.  We can't get enough of Lil' Marky.  God, man.  That is just oof.  I don't know what happened to him, but I hope Mark Fox is dead.  I hope I can find him.  He might still be kicking around.  I don't want to see that prick no more.  Yeah, Hall, you won't see him no more.  Hey, you got a little voice in there. 
[03:27:00]  Maybe you take some digging and sweat it out.  All right.  It's all about the bird flu.  It's all about the bird flu.  This is the big story of fear.  This is going to be the fear for quite a while now.  This is the biggie.  They're talking pandemic, and no one even knows what the fuck a pandemic is.  That means a million dead.  A million dead.  A million dead.  A million dead from the flu.  This beats out the shark fear thing that we're used to. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Well, a million dead.  You get it from what?  The birds?  The birds.  The birds.  The birds.  You get it from the birds.  Fezzy.  Hey.  Emo, Emo, you are running Fez.  Does it start with zoo animals?  And how do you get it?  Do you know anything about the bird flu yet?  Well, it seems, yeah, you get it.  You can get it from people, but you get it from birds.  That's where it starts. 
[03:28:00]  Flu particles enter the respiratory system, Opie.  And using keys, the virus locks into your lung cells.  It has like, like your lung cell has a keyhole, let's say.  And the virus has these little spikes on it that are like keys.  And it links right in.  And now it tricks the cells into believing the virus is something useful, like food or  some hormone that's needed.  So it is embraced by the cells.  The virus infiltrates the host cells, hijacks the reproductive mechanisms, and then starts 
[03:28:30]  reproducing replicas of the virus as if they are something that is needed by the body.  Do you understand how much you sound like you're describing Middle Eastern exchange students?  It's exactly what they do.  They assimilate to the body.  Then the antibodies that usually fight over, they fight them from past flus and infections.  They try to attach on to the new flu and fight it. 
[03:29:00]  But the flu is so new, and it's from animals, that it doesn't have the proper keyhole for  the key that the virus has.  So it tries to latch on to it, can't do it, can't fight it, can't kill it.  So it just locks on to different organ cells, triggers more of them, proteins that invade,  invading microbes.  And then before you know it, it overwhelms your vital organs.  How do you know all this?  Because there's so much...  Well, I did a little research, and I saw something, I think it was Discovery Channel. 
[03:29:30]  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates, here comes Professor Anthony.  Wow.  Where's the bird flu happening?  Where did it start?  Well, I think we have to blame Asia once again.  Enough with these people and their fucking sinus problems.  The hacking Chinese are responsible for this again.  But now it's all over.  Yeah, well, there's the bird flu. 
[03:30:00]  Hey, Anthony, I was doing a little studying as well.  What war was it that more people died from the flu than actually being shot and blown up  and all that?  What's that?  Oh, I know which one.  What war?  Either World War I or World War II, more people died of the flu.  It was World War II.  Little known fact, more people died of the flu as they were fighting one of those world  wars. 
[03:30:30]  How about that?  How about that?  Well, that goes to a lot of the wars, especially before good medicine.  A lot more people died, like the Civil War.  A lot more people died of disease than died killing each other in the Civil War.  Well, there's a lot of controversy over this bird flu, too.  They're saying that it can't go from human to human, because if it could, that would be  a disaster, obviously.  Well, they're worried about that.  They're worried that that might happen eventually.  Let's say hi to Steve.  It could mutate.  Steve?  Hi, how you doing?  How do you know it can't go from human to human?  Well, I heard a scientist on, I believe it was CNN, and said it can't pass from human 
[03:31:00]  to human yet.  He basically said that news media was full of shit, because it hasn't mutated that far.  It could take 10, 20, 30, 100 years.  It might not ever do it, but it could do it.  We have to prepare now.  Steve?  Yes?  We want to believe you so bad.  What state are you from?  Indiana.  All right. 
[03:31:30]  Well, they've got some smarties in Indiana.  How can you...  I'm out of here.  All right.  Have a good day.  Yes, pandemic means worldwide.  Yes, Bill, we knew that.  Oh.  We were just kind of having fun with that word a little bit.  Epidemic worse than pandemic?  Epidemic?  Pandemic.  Epidemic sounds pretty bad.  All right.  We've got some audio.  Let's go to it.  Zoo animals being screened, Anthony.  Oh, good.  Screening zoo animals.  Get your flu shots.  Fears of the avian flu are prompting drastic measures in several countries tonight. 
[03:32:00]  In Turkey and Romania, farm birds are being killed, and people are getting flu shots simply  because of a suspected outbreak.  Here at home, there are new calls to be prepared.  CBS 2's Tony Aiello reports.  Routine health care for birds at the Bronx Zoo now includes a search for any sign of avian flu.  We continually do surveillance for diseases and birds at all of our zoos in the city of New York.  Dr. Robert Cook says the work takes place at a lab in the Bronx and at Wildlife Conservation Society 
[03:32:30]  We have specialists in veterinary medicine who are doing surveillance on the ground in those regions of the world  where these emerging diseases are a problem.  Regions such as Southeast Asia, where avian flu has been detected in 12 nations.  About 120 people who had close contact with birds have been infected.  More than half those people have died.  The current strain of avian flu, called H5N1, hasn't shown an ability to easily pass from human to human so far. 
[03:33:00]  The fear is the bird flu may combine with human flu to create a lethal new disease.  Once it spreads person to person, it will be catastrophic.  Tuesday in White Plains, scientists joined a politician in urging the government to be prepared.  It is late, and that's why we have to really put our foot on the gas and get moving on this urgent, urgent issue. 
[03:33:30]  Experts agree you can help by getting this year's flu vaccine.  The more doses used, the more manufacturers will be encouraged to boost production.  That could be vital should an avian flu vaccine have to be rushed into production.  So, give them a financial incentive to fucking save the world, you shitheads.  Did you hear that?  We've got to encourage them to make more for us.  Origin, Hong Kong. 
[03:34:00]  Here are some outbreaks for the ages.  We've got the Russian flu, 1889 to 1890.  Killed, let's see, a million people, including an unknown number of Americans.  Origin, Russia.  The Spanish flu killed a lot of people, what, 50 million to 100 million people worldwide, including a half a million Americans.  Wow.  In 1918 to 19.  And the origin was the United States.  We're guilty. 
[03:34:30]  Then the rest of them, though.  Asian flu, China.  And now Hong Kong.  The Hong Kong flu.  Hong Kong.  And now this one?  Also Hong Kong.  How about SARS?  SARS.  I don't think that's a flu, though.  Well, whatever it is, it's an outbreak.  But again, yeah, it's China.  It's China.  We're not worried about SARS anymore, right?  Hong Kong flu.  Death toll, a million people, 34,000 Americans.  In this one, they're talking estimated 180 to 360 million people dead, including 1.7 million Americans. 
[03:35:00]  But, you know, panicky Pete's that everybody...  Two million Americans with the fucking bird flu, why don't they stop it?  That's what they did.  Remember the hurricane?  20,000 could be dead.  Oh, we got like 900 million.  Two million.  Who fucking hangs out with birds?  I don't know two million people that hang out with birds.  Just fucking kill the things already.  Yeah, what's the problem?  Shoot them.  Who cares about the birds?  Stop feeding them.  Leave them in a cage.  No food.  You're done.  I fucking hate birds.  Let's hear some more audio.  From the White House to the corner coffee shop, talk of a potential outbreak of avian flu has stirred much concern. 
[03:35:30]  But how much of that is warranted?  Our Homeland Security correspondent, Gene Meserve, takes an alarming look at the first line of defense against a possible epidemic.  An emergency room physician calls a public health department reporting a patient with symptoms of deadly botulism.  He is told, I wouldn't worry too much if I were you.  A caller to another health department describes bubonic plague. 
[03:36:00]  An employee there says, don't worry, go back to bed.  The calls were part of a test.  The results, sobering.  We have a long way to go to train our public health workforce to be a first line of defense.  Experts predict millions could die in an avian flu outbreak.  But, as with other diseases, rapid detection could help curb its spread and lower the death toll.  That is why local public health departments are supposed to be able to receive information about a wide range of serious illnesses 24-7. 
[03:36:30]  But RAND researchers discovered that some aren't even answering the phone.  I don't like the news media saying 24-7.  Yeah.  It's become so accepted.  It's like using rap lingo.  Yeah.  In 2003, they made a series of calls to 19 public health departments, claiming to be doctors or nurses reporting urgent cases of illness.  Three agencies were dropped from the test after failing to answer or return five consecutive calls.  Many departments failed to respond in 30 minutes, as mandated by the Centers for Disease Control. 
[03:37:00]  And some took more than 10 hours.  Only two met all federal guidelines.  That's not acceptable at all.  Absolutely not.  We now, in today's environment, we have to have 24-hour emergent contact in the public health system.  When the calls were answered, the quality of advice was sometimes poor.  When researchers described smallpox symptoms, none of the health departments suggested isolating the patient or using personal protective equipment, 
[03:37:30]  though the dangerous disease is highly contagious.  Since September 11th, an estimated $3 billion has been spent on public health.  If the tests had been conducted before that spending, experts speculate the results might have been even worse.  If they were conducted now, the results might be better.  Might.  Sounds like it's going to be okay.  It's fine.  That's right.  Could your backyard bird feeder kill you?  Well, that's what I'm waiting for.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get the news teases. 
[03:38:00]  They're going to be all over this bird flu thing for months now.  For the entire winter.  You watch.  You watch.  They're just revving up the fear machine for all of us.  And you know what's annoying is that they're mentioning diseases to these.  These disease control people stink, but they should definitely stop mentioning diseases that haven't been, like, a reality in 500 years.  Yeah.  Stop.  You fucking scurvy.  Who has that?  He's got the consumption.  I got a case of the vapors.  But they're mentioning things that could be, like, you know, anything. 
[03:38:30]  Like, well, you know, I'm sweating.  I'm feeling kind of tired.  Flu symptoms.  Yeah.  And they're saying, well, that could also be fucking bubonic plague.  Well, who has that anymore?  Who has it?  So now everyone that gets the flu this winter is going to completely panic.  Freak out.  Completely panic.  Where are the birds?  Hey, what can we do, Anthony?  There are some things we could do.  Yes, there's a couple of things you can do.  Instant immunity boosters.  Here are your five ways to fortify your flu defenses.  Go for a flu shot.  Every fall, assuming there's no shortage.  Hate needles? 
[03:39:00]  Ask for the nasal spray flu shot.  Friends?  Make more friends.  A large social circle equals extra flu antibodies.  But don't bond during a pandemic.  So have your friends and you'll share antibodies.  How about that?  Sex?  Have it often.  Your levels of flu-fighting antigen immunoglobin may rise by 30% by having sex.  Really?  Meditation.  Focus on a word or your breath to increase immunity. 
[03:39:30]  Focus on your breath?  Football.  Breathing.  Antivirals?  Pop them within two days of infection and you'll fight off the flu faster.  What are some of those antivirals, Anthony?  Osiloscoccalin in them.  Right.  Okay.  Sure.  I have that in my pocket.  Osiloscoccalin.  Is that NyQuil?  No.  I don't know what an antiviral is.  It sounds like something you need a prescription for.  It's kind of like viral, but it's against it. 
[03:40:00]  But it's against it.  Right.  The antiviral.  It's not proviral.  And, of course, they're telling you your essentials that you need in the worst-case scenario.  Masks.  Put on, like, breathing masks, not funny, wacky masks.  Non-perishable foods.  Bottled water.  And grape juice.  Concord grapes are packed with the antioxidant resveralatrol, which has been shown in tests  to inhibit reproduction of the flu virus by 90%.  Welch's grape juice.  I told you.  They forgot a baseball bat in case any birds flutter around you. 
[03:40:30]  Smack them.  And garlic.  Jay on Long Island, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, I learned that Anthony had to correct Betsy Holt.  Very good.  Let's say hi to Jason in New Hampshire.  Today I learned Jimmy was missing pages 118 to 142.  Yeah, that was a shame.  Hey, Jason, is it raining in New Hampshire?  That's it.  Party is over.  Everybody go home.  Speak for the Edimony Show. </pre>
