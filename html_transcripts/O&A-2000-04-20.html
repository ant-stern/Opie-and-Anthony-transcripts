<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the hosts' coffee consumption and subsequent bathroom trips, seguing into a detailed and highly profane recounting of an awkward dinner at Iguana restaurant with eight co-workers, including “Spaz.”  The $403 bill, inflated by numerous rounds of shots and a newly invented "penalty shot" game, led to a contentious splitting of the cost, with several co-workers significantly underpaying.  Earl paid only $15, and Spaz, despite ordering a pricey steak and numerous drinks, contributed only $20. Opie ultimately had to cover the shortfall with his credit card.  The conversation then shifted to Spaz's attempts to ingratiate himself with their superiors, Ken (station manager) and Jeremy (boss). A phone call to Ken at a train station resulted in a grudging agreement to a future coffee meeting, despite Spaz admitting to giving Jeremy the finger the previous night.  Jeremy and Spaz were both in studio to discuss this incident. The Elian Gonzalez story was briefly mentioned.

The show continued with a caller confirming a breast display on TRL, leading to a discussion about on-air nudity.  This transitioned into an outtake reel of Anthony's disastrous attempts to record a Bosch wiper blade commercial, filled with expletives. Opie's decision to attend a Knicks playoff game on Easter Sunday instead of family events generated numerous listener calls, with some expressing outrage, others support, and many identifying as Jewish and planning to attend the game.  A marijuana-themed song was played. A later call concerned a listener whose wife was upset about his attendance at a Mötley Crüe concert instead of family events, prompting a discussion on the pros and cons of family gatherings. A call about a woman exercising naked in her yard and angering her neighbors followed, with humorous commentary on the complaining women's appearances.  A significant portion of the show featured songs by Anthony's brother, Joe, and Cowbell Bill, including a song mocking Spaz and, most notably, a highly controversial song about the Columbine High School massacre set to the *Patty Duke Show* theme song.  Listener reactions to these songs ranged from approval to outrage,  sparking further discussion about their appropriateness (or lack thereof) and its eligibility for their "Most Offensive Song" contest.

A substantial segment was dedicated to "What's in My Pants," a game involving guessing what's between a female caller's legs based on sounds.  Several callers participated, with varying levels of cooperation, leading to sexually suggestive commentary. Gina and Donna ultimately won, revealing a "wood floor" texture.  Recurring bits included a discussion of the difference between a Hitler mustache and a mohawk, a running joke about a pool rack filled with afro hair, and extensive discussion of "cranky ass," attributed to infrequent bowel movements and long walks.  The hosts also recounted a failed attempt to videotape a young virgin getting a bikini wax, noting the audio of the attempt caused one listener to miss a meeting due to arousal.  The show included promotional segments for the Vermont Teddy Bear Company and Stacker 2.  Capone Bill, Anthony's brother Joe, and his sister Dawn participated in the broadcast.

The broadcast continued with a MindSpring commercial followed by listener calls, including John from Nutley praising "Joe's Homo No. 1."  Jerry expressed outrage over the Columbine song, while another John recounted a New Year's Eve diarrhea incident.  The hosts then discussed Dawn's offensive song about Spaz, which received negative feedback from female listeners, and promoted her upcoming performance at Sergeant Pepper's Pub.  Dawn's past employment at Victoria's Secret and Frederick's of Hollywood was also discussed.  The show then moved to plans for a future segment involving pouring hot wax on female callers, including a volunteer, Katie. A fake commercial for "Head Greeting Cards" by producer Rick was played, followed by more discussion about the hot wax segment and promotion of the hosts' upcoming gig at Sergeant Pepper's Pub. Cowbell Bill and Joe were mentioned as being in the studio.  The Columbine song parody was again mentioned.  A caller, Kelly, in a van with several men, participated in a segment involving duct tape and hair removal.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show. There's a good example of four programs. 1027 WNAW.  It's the ONA Show.  Rick's like all worried that you're not going to come in when the music starts open.  We're professionals.  Of course.  I was leaking as you started that rejoiner bed.  Leaking.  Taking a leak.  Like, God damn, are we addicted to coffee? 
[00:00:30]  What's going on with that?  What is up with that?  Well, that's the thing, too.  Like, we drink it, and then we've got to take leaks.  But we're not taking as many long breaks as we used to around here.  Yeah.  So we just wind up doing the pee-pee dance in the chair.  I remember the days I'd get up for the radio show by doing, like, blow and stuff.  Yeah.  When was that?  Just trying to act cool.  Yeah, you're right.  Cool.  Drugs are cool. 
[00:01:00]  Who are you kidding, man?  Know how many radio guys do blow?  Blow.  Blow.  Yeah, we've known a few of them.  A few?  Anyway, how are you guys?  I'm well.  Good.  I was hearing some stories from last night's little dinner festivities that you invited Spaz to.  Well, does everyone know what's going on with that by now?  Spaz wanted to hang out with the guys after the show. 
[00:01:30]  There are a lot of nights after the show we go out to eat and stuff, you know, shoot the S.  Get some good show ideas, you know.  Right.  We kind of hang.  Sure.  And Spaz hasn't really been a part of that.  No.  Mostly because right after the show he's running to the Port Authority to get his train back to Rockland County, wherever the hell he lives.  Yeah.  So he was feeling slighted.  So yesterday he said, hey, I want to go with you guys.  He wanted to get to know me a little better.  Mm-hmm.  So then, so we all went out.  There was eight of us, Ant. 
[00:02:00]  I'm pissed that you didn't go.  Eight of you went out to dinner.  Eight guys.  We went to Iguana.  I want to thank the people at Iguana.  They treat us nice.  I'm just hearing nightmare stories about huge bills, most of which was for shots.  Well.  People stiffing you on the tab.  All right.  Well, where do we begin? 
[00:02:30]  An embarrassing homo moment?  I don't know.  This is just what I'm hearing.  Well, first of all, we get into Iguana.  Let's start from the beginning.  And then it's the awkward, okay, where's everyone going to sit?  That's just not how guys do it.  Oh, you're just going out.  You got to eat, guys.  You're going to dinner or whatever.  You know, you just sit down, order food, and that's it.  Right.  But see, Spaz wanted to get to know me outside the show.  So now I felt obligated to sit next to Spaz. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  So I had to, like, tell everyone, no, Spaz has to sit here.  I'm going to sit here.  Mm-hmm.  And then it's just.  Now there's, like, a seating thing.  I mean, it was just awkward.  What, Ben?  I don't know.  Oh.  Have I told you lately?  Oh.  First of all, what I want to get off my chest is I'm not going out to dinner with any of these guys ever again.  Well, now, see, you made this mistake a couple of times already.  The last two weeks, the money that is flying out of my pocket is ridiculous. 
[00:03:30]  That's what I'm hearing.  Because we've got a bunch of cheap Fs that work on this radio show.  And if you're going to be a cheap F, you shouldn't be ordering round after round of shots that cost $8 a shot.  How much were those shots, really?  How much were they?  They weren't cheap.  Probably, like, five or six.  Five or six bucks.  Five or six bucks.  Five or six bucks.  Five or seven or eight.  And you know me.  I don't. 
[00:04:00]  I don't.  Jägermeister and Patron tequila.  That's top of my mind.  And, yeah.  You know me.  I don't really do a lot of drinking, especially during a school night, as we like to call it.  Maybe on the weekends I'll partake a little bit more.  Nothing like a bunch of guys hanging out doing shots.  I mean, you probably weren't even involved.  I wasn't involved.  I had a couple beers.  That was it.  So how much was the bill, Rick?  Because Rick got stiffed the worst.  Oh, wait.  I got stiffed.  I got pretty screwed. 
[00:04:30]  $400.  $400.  The bill was $400.  Yeah.  Mostly for booze.  Right.  Because the iguana, I mean, the prices are reasonable.  It's good food, you know.  But the entrees aren't $20, $30.  The entrees are like $12, $14 tops.  Yeah.  So I had that skewer thing on rice.  It was like $12.95 on the menu.  And I had two Coronas. 
[00:05:00]  Corona light.  Whatever.  You're going to abuse me because I drink light beer.  Whatever.  What the F?  All right.  So all of a sudden the bill comes after these guys order shots after shots after shots.  Because next thing you know, we're celebrating Spaz's birthday.  All I wanted was a quick meal after the show and crash.  We're there for like three hours.  They're ordering shots.  Every five, ten minutes, the Jägermeister's coming.  And they're ordering like penalty shots. 
[00:05:30]  What the hell's a penalty shot, Rick?  A penalty shot?  You never heard of a penalty shot?  Okay.  Because we made it up just last night.  They made it up for Spaz.  But it worked like a charm.  Yeah, it worked like a charm.  It made more money out of my goddamn pocket.  Woo!  Yeah.  Basically what we decided a penalty shot was, if you go to like, you know, cheer everybody,  you know, everybody clinks glasses or whatever.  Yeah.  And you miss one, the guy who misses has to buy the next round of shots.  Woo!  And we call it a penalty shot.  Woo! 
[00:06:00]  How many shots did you guys order that I had nothing to do with?  All of them.  How many, though?  How many rounds?  Four or five?  At least four.  At least four rounds.  Four to five.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, man.  This kind of reminds me of when I was, before I got married, when I'd get a message from  a woman that would say, you know, we need to talk or I've got a bone to pick with you.  This is woman stuff, man.  This thing with Spaz.  I mean, that's why I got married.  So I didn't have to hear any of that crap from women anymore. 
[00:06:30]  I want to talk to you.  We need to talk.  I completely agree, Mike.  Completely.  Thank you.  Earl, lock the door.  Earl's going nowhere.  Look at it.  Yeah.  All right.  So besides everything that was going on, which we'll get to, let's get it off our chest with  the bill.  The bill was how much?  You said 400 and how many?  With tip, $403.  $403.  Okay.  400 bucks.  Okay.  Let's just use and.  Because if I'm out of line, you're more than welcome to say I am. 
[00:07:00]  Okay?  Technically, we're celebrating Spaz's birthday.  I don't know how that started, but we were.  Okay?  So I'll give it to the guys.  Okay?  They're ordering all the shots.  I had no shots.  Okay.  First of all, all right, the bill's $403.  $403.  How many guys are there?  Eight guys.  Okay.  All right.  So basically, right off the bat, that would mean 50 bucks a guy.  50 bucks each.  You know something?  Oh, I know you don't do shots or anything, a couple of beers, that, but you're out. 
[00:07:30]  Everybody, I mean everybody, should have thrown in 50 bucks.  That's the only way you handle stuff like that, is to throw in 50 bucks.  Which is fine, and I think you even agree with that.  But when it gets to the point where you're throwing in 80, 90 bucks to compensate for  someone that ain't putting in their share, then there's a problem.  All right.  I'll be completely honest.  I put in, last night, 47 bucks.  Okay.  That's fine.  I had, like, the stupid skewers and coronas.  Two coronas. 
[00:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  Tops should have cost me 25 bucks before tips.  Tops.  So I figured an extra 20, 22 bucks, I'm covered.  You put in...  Because I'm not doing the shots with these guys.  Well, give or take a buck or two, you put in your 50.  Right.  I gave Rick another 10 today, because I felt bad.  Okay.  So, technically, I put 57 bucks in.  All right.  Okay.  And Ben, I heard, just put in a load, too.  I put in a lot of money.  And that first corona, I paid for at the bar when we first got in there.  Right.  Because I bought everybody a round when I get in.  Right.  Right.  But that doesn't count.  I mean, if you're going to be a cool guy and just buy a round of beers, that's great. 
[00:08:30]  I mean, everyone does that.  Yeah.  It's just one of those things to do, right?  I'm just talking about the dinner tab at this point.  Our boss went with us, Jeremy.  He put in 80.  Rick, how much did you put in?  60.  60.  So, you're $10 over.  Ben?  70.  70.  Where's spaz?  Get spaz in here.  Now, here's the funny part, Dan.  The bill comes.  Yeah.  Passes around the table.  And it lands on me.  Okay.  So, I'm like, all right, I'll count up all the money.  First pass around.  Sure.  The bill's 400 total. 
[00:09:00]  I count it out to 200 and, no, $180.  It's just like that.  It's just the first go-around.  $180 on a $400 tab.  Yeah.  And you're sitting there like, you're sitting there like, oh, now you've got a  tell people to take more money out of their stupid, it's just, I didn't put in, who put  in, it's not enough.  Okay.  Well, that's the deal.  When it's divvied up, it's easy.  400 bucks, eight people, 50 bucks a piece.  That should have been it.  No one should have been putting in 80, 70, 60, 50 bucks each. 
[00:09:30]  Now, okay, you put in, Ben put in huge amounts.  Rick took care of it.  Right.  But who didn't put in to compensate for the huge amounts?  Well, John, you're in this too, you idiot.  How much did you put in last night?  I put in 32 bucks.  They gave him 10 bucks today.  All right.  So you're still $8 short.  I can give him eight bucks.  I got no problem.  He put 30 in last night.  Now, making up for it today, it doesn't really help.  It's not as good because it was a pain in the ass last night.  Last night.  So how much did you put in?  In total, 42 bucks.  No, last night.  32 bucks. 
[00:10:00]  So he, along with $18, short.  Short.  Tally up.  Tally up.  Okay.  Okay.  Here's the big one.  Here it comes.  Earl.  Watch this.  How much did you put in on a $400 bill?  Including tip and everything.  15 bucks.  15 bucks.  Jesus.  15 dollars.  He can't go out to you with us anymore.  Earl, you're no longer invited.  Honestly.  Earl.  I thought everybody was paying for what they bought.  But now do they know?  No, it doesn't work that way.  I didn't know.  I swear to God. 
[00:10:30]  Didn't know.  Eddie, I don't know.  15 bucks.  That doesn't even cover what you ate.  Yeah, that isn't even close.  I only had an appetizer.  I didn't even eat dinner.  Eddie was doing shots.  I was not doing shots.  That ain't even close.  And Spaz, how much did you put in last night?  Spaz.  Spaz, come on.  Here, here, here.  20.  20.  Now, ask him what he got off the menu to eat.  Yeah, what did you order last night?  Steak.  And how much was the steak on the menu?  Uh, 20 bucks. 
[00:11:00]  He ordered a $20 steak.  And he put in 20.  Yeah.  Dude, he ordered a $20 steak.  He had the appetizers.  He had at least four shots.  Plus beers.  Plus three or four beers, right?  I thought they were buying it for me.  Oh, my God.  No, when you go out with a group of people, you don't assume that anyone's buying you anything.  It's not like you're a girl and we're buying you dinner, you idiot.  It's a bunch of guys.  It's a bunch of guys.  I didn't ask for that.  Divide the number of guys.  Put that into the bill. 
[00:11:30]  So there you go.  Yeah, the bill by the number of guys and you have how much you each have.  Look, this makes sense.  John was $18 short last night.  Spaz was $30 short last night.  $30 short.  And Earl was $35 short last night.  $35 short.  And that's $30, $35, $18, $75.  That's about $100.  $85.  Spaz puts in $20 after Monday a night spending $740 to stay one night at the St. Regis.  Now he's a penny pincher.  Ten more today. 
[00:12:00]  Ten more today.  Everyone's putting more in today.  Because it was a big deal before the show.  I'm like, because we all walked in pissed off.  Because it took like, it took 20 minutes just to get enough money to pay the bill.  Because the bill just had to keep going round and round the table.  And these cheap Fs are like slowly but surely going, all right, I'll put another $5 in.  $5?  We need another like $30 per guy at this point.  Oh, no, somebody's chucking me singles.  You know there's trouble when you have $180 on a $400 tab and you start seeing the ones. 
[00:12:30]  Like, well, this is going to take a big stack of ones.  And Rick was doing the counting, so he keeps counting going, nah, that can't be right.  And he would count.  Nah, that can't be right.  I thought I was like messed up from drinking.  And I'm like, nothing worse.  And Rick has a buzz going on, so he's counting the money.  And you know how he gets all giggly and laughing.  You're just laughing.  And I'm like at the other end of the table going, oh, this isn't good.  That's why you will always see, if I go out with a group of people, I will grab the check.  First thing, look at the amount.  Look at the amount of people.  Divvy up my share.  Put it in and state to the table, okay, I'm in for $50. 
[00:13:00]  Boom.  And I'm done.  Right.  I don't give a flying F if the check makes the rounds and the last guy has only my $50  in his hand.  I'm out of there.  Right.  I did my part.  Right.  I'm not putting in more for anybody slacking off.  I'm not doing it.  I did my part.  Goodbye.  Deal with it.  Well, basically, we still didn't have enough cash.  I don't care.  No, no, no.  I'm talking about last night.  So I had to crack out my credit card.  Oh, no.  And what did you do? 
[00:13:30]  So you took all the cash.  I had to take the cash and be like, all right.  That's good.  I can chase people around.  Who's making up for the 20% interest you're paying on that?  Yeah.  $400 check.  And then at one point, Spaz is so drunky that he pulls out the...  I thought he was going for the new credit card.  I got it.  I got it.  Do not pull out that stupid credit card again.  I got it.  I put it on my credit card.  And then the waiter went from, you know, being in a good mood to, oh, my God, these  guys, how they're going to stiff me.  Because he was standing.  He was standing.  Did you know he was standing over your back the whole time as you're slowly but surely 
[00:14:00]  trying to figure out how we're going to pay for the meal last night?  Yep.  The same waiter that was all happy and singing happy birthday and...  Well, what was the actual tip?  Like $70.  Okay, $70.  So he's figuring if you're scraping dollars together and you don't even have the check yet,  the tab, he's getting effed.  Well, I guess they...  No, he threw the gratuity in.  He gave them the $70.  He's included.  Yeah.  They included it because they probably saw us coming.  Wow.  Goddamn. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  You just...  You can't go out with a group...  With this group of people.  No.  You know who's safe to go out with?  Ben's safe.  I've seen Ben foot the bell a couple of times.  Ben's very safe.  Ben's very safe.  Rick's safe.  Yeah.  You're safe.  Yeah.  Oh, Spaz, put your hand down.  Oh, shut up, Spaz.  You are so not safe.  Shut up.  You're getting reamed.  I know one night when we were all at Hooters, one night, remember that when Manny was here  and we all went down to Hooters?  I wound up pulling my credit card out that night and I chalked up like $230 on the thing. 
[00:15:00]  What's that?  You said you were going to pay for it.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  You said you were going to pay for it that night.  Don't even throw me that.  I said I was going to pay for it.  You said don't worry about it.  I'll get the bill.  After the check came, yeah.  And I saw that no one was going to be fessing up.  This was a huge amount of cash.  You didn't give us a chance to go into my wallet.  Oh, stop.  Oh, just stop.  Don't throw this garbage at me.  You said you didn't give us a chance to go into my wallet.  Are we bonding, Spat? 
[00:15:30]  Don't call me cheap on that because you were cheap last night.  Last night was one night.  Earl was cheap, but you guys all had fun drinking the shots at $5 or $6 a pop.  More.  That was more than $5 or $6.  Those were like $8 shots.  $8 shots.  Easily.  You'll have money tomorrow.  No, I didn't know, so I'm not a deadbeat.  Earl, I don't think we'd expect $50 because if you just had an appetizer and you weren't  drinking, okay, but you...  What?  He had a shot.  You forced him to do a half a shot.  I didn't even do the half a shot. 
[00:16:00]  I did like a quarter shot.  But no, honestly, I thought everybody was just paying for what they bought.  Had I known, I would have called...  I didn't know.  It should work that way to a point.  I mean, when like...  Yeah, if somebody's getting a $20 steak and eight beers, yeah, you know, they should chip  in a little more.  What you got to do is, you know, you've got to figure out what you're going to throw in.  Wow, I was drinking a lot more than everyone, and I ordered the $20 steak.  Maybe I'll...  All right, if it's $50, man, maybe I should put $70 in.  Right.  You know?  I don't know. 
[00:16:30]  I'm from the camp where you just divvy it up.  I don't care if you had a salad and water.  If you're drinking with everybody, you're hanging out, you're going to be...  You're going to have to do it that way.  There was no way at that point you could divvy up what everyone had.  But that's why, if you want a separate check before things start, you tell the person,  give me a separate check.  A lot of people are saying on the phone lines, Spaz should not have paid.  This was not supposed to be Spaz's birthday.  These idiots turn it into that because they want to get him hammered again. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  We didn't go out with the intention of saying, hey, Spaz, we're doing this for you, so don't  bother paying anything.  Right.  Because this has happened to me in the past, too.  I had another restaurant, Matt's.  It's Matt's, right?  Matt's, yeah.  Where I go there for a beer and, like, a stupid chicken sandwich, you know?  And all of a sudden, they decide that Spaz needs to try martinis for the first time,  so they're ordering rounds of martinis.  Next thing I know, my stupid sandwich and a beer has cost me another 50 or 60 bucks.  When you see stuff like this starting, if you want to punch out, you punch out early. 
[00:17:30]  You say, I need a separate check.  That's...  Well, that's why.  It's a douche move, too.  It is.  I know it is, but, I mean, if you're going to get that way about it, if you're not going  to divvy up even, then you've got to get the separate check.  Yeah.  I mean, I see a few sides to this twisted story.  No, you don't really see the true side of this because you haven't been out with these  guys.  These guys are a bunch of luscious.  I tend to drink them myself. 
[00:18:00]  I understand.  Not to the point that these guys get going.  But there's almost fistfights at the table because they're so drunk.  Oh.  Of course.  Guess who starts with the racial stuff.  Oh, let me guess.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, right.  Earl.  No, I think Spaz.  Yeah, Earl is the target.  Spaz.  Spaz starts saying, how much is that Earl in the window?  Oh.  And he starts doing monkey sounds.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  Just two times.  Two beats. 
[00:18:30]  So, Spaz, everyone wants to know how our little dinner went.  I sat next to you.  Yes.  We talked a little bit.  Yes.  How did it go for you?  You opened up a little bit.  Opened up.  Oh.  I did not open up a little bit.  Oh, no.  You entertained my questions.  Oh, no.  And he wants to hang out with our boss, the big boss.  What?  Like Ken.  Ken?  Ken.  What do you want to hang out with Ken?  The general manager.  He wants to get to know him outside the station.  I don't want to hang out with Ken. 
[00:19:00]  No one wants to hang out with Ken.  I don't want to hang out with Ken.  You don't want to get too close to the big boss.  Big boss.  Say hello.  You keep it professional and that's it.  No, he wants to get to know him outside the station, he said.  Why?  Maybe have a few beers with Ken.  Ken doesn't even know who you are.  Yeah.  I know.  Oh, my God.  People are laughing out there.  You don't get to try to know the big, big boss.  The big, big boss.  Ken is at the top of the boss hierarchy here at this station.  And you want to hang out with him. 
[00:19:30]  Why don't you at least say hello to me?  I want to go to BlackRock and meet Mel.  It's a good thing he doesn't work at Microsoft.  Yeah.  Hello, Bill Gates?  Bill Gates.  I'm having a problem installing my video card.  I thought maybe you could come over and we'll have a couple of beers and you can help me put it in.  Spence, you just don't understand how a work environment works, do you? 
[00:20:00]  Did you hang with Jeremy?  Yes, Opie, and it's Jeremy.  It's our boss.  He's like, we have to hang with him.  He's the liaison from this show to management.  Right.  So why can't I hang, too?  Well, because you're not even qualified to hang with Rick.  Holy mother of pearl.  You're barely qualified to hang with Rick.  Unbelievable.  Am I not a part of the show?  Dude, I go to lunch with Jeremy at least once a week, sometimes twice a week.  I see him as soon as I get into work to talk about the show. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  There are roles people have on this program and in this company.  Now, Opie's role as being a part of the Opie and Anthony show and being like one half of Opie and Anthony is to talk with the boss, with Jeremy.  I'm the liaison for Ant and I.  Yeah.  So I discuss the issues of the show.  I discuss, you know, what we need in the future.  I discuss road shows.  So why would you have a relationship with Jeremy? 
[00:21:00]  Because he's my boss.  You just say hi to him.  That's all you need to do.  Wave to him in the hall.  I barely qualified to hang with Rick.  Yeah.  Look how hurt he looks.  That's a bad statement there.  So I can't hang with you?  Because then, like, Rick's on the other side, like, Jeremy's on this side, then Rick's on the other side.  Then Rick and I have the liaison thing going with stuff.  So you're below that.  I know I'm below that, but I still can't hang?  I think you're below that even. 
[00:21:30]  What?  I would say.  That was really bad.  But he wants to go in, like, go down the hall right now because he's leaving to catch a train.  And go down, Rick, go with him, and tell Ken you want to go hang out with him and have some beers one day soon.  I want to see what he says.  Get a phone.  Yeah, get a phone.  Get a phone.  I've got to hear this.  I'm below.  Do you know what my relationship with Ken Stevens is, our boss?  How you doing? 
[00:22:00]  Hi.  Oh, we have a problem with another station in the Infinity family coming to my office.  That's pretty much it.  That is it.  There's nothing there where it's like, hey, Ken, you know, I'm thinking maybe after the show or we'll go out a couple of beers.  I mean, I wouldn't even think of that.  I just want a hello.  You want a hello?  Hello?  What do you think this is? 
[00:22:30]  Daycare?  Yeah.  This is the real world.  This is how it works in an office atmosphere.  This isn't Disneyland.  Everybody is happy and waving to each other in goofy costumes.  Hello, Spaz.  You're a guest here at NEW.  There's one camaraderie.  Three-fingered, white-gloved hands waving at you down the hallway. 
[00:23:00]  Hello?  Hello?  We have camaraderie.  Below people?  There's a hierarchy here.  Dude, the fact is...  Just like any workplace.  We abuse you.  We ride you really hard every day.  But the fact is, if anyone from the outside tries to, you know, attack you, I'm going to, you know, I'll defend you.  See?  We have camaraderie that way.  You're like the retard in a family.  Even though, like, they make fun of him and stuff behind his back and they're, you know, they're...  Timmer!  Right. 
[00:23:30]  But if anyone outside the family makes fun of him, you know, that's not cool.  Only we can make fun of you.  Timmer!  I'm a retard, though.  Did you see South Park last night?  No.  They've lost their effing minds, man, Matt and Trey.  Yeah.  They had a retarded kid in a little wheelchair and all they said was, Timmer!  Timmer!  Timmer!  We ended up being the singer in a rock band.  Why don't we have Spaz in a wheelchair all day?  No.  Just screaming to me.  He's like all drooling.  He had this huge light bulb-shaped head and these teeth that stuck out. 
[00:24:00]  They're under...  They're under mud.  Mr. Garrison was yelling at him because he wasn't paying attention.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Like, hey, he's retarded.  Yeah.  Don't use that kind of language.  And then, Spaz, we're waiting to see if we can get our boss on the phone because Spaz wants to ask him for beers.  Spaz said he's going to write down our little dinner on his calendar.  The same calendar that he wrote down...  No, we don't have to remind people about it.  What?  When you were cheating on your girlfriend, you wrote it down on the calendar that you and your girlfriend share in your apartment? 
[00:24:30]  So you wrote down that you went out to dinner with Opie.  Did you write it down yet?  Not yet.  All right.  What are you going to write down?  That it went well?  No, no.  I just write down dinner with any W crew conversation with Opie.  What were you going to write down originally, though?  Dinner with Opie.  And no one else.  There were seven guys there.  Did you tell Jeremy F.U. last night?  Well, he gave him the finger. 
[00:25:00]  You gave Jeremy the finger?  Yeah.  What was that all about?  Ken is on his way to the airport, so he's on 12th.  Oh, very nice.  Oh, there you go.  Hey, Ken.  Hey, Ken.  Hello.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got you on the air.  Opie and Anthony, how you doing?  Hey, what's up?  See, this is the most we've talked to Ken in the last month, right?  Absolutely.  I don't think we've ever talked to him on the air.  Ken, do you know who Spaz is?  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, I've seen him in the hallway.  You've seen him in the hallway.  You've never officially talked to him, right?  I've never spoken one word to Spaz.  Because there's no real reason, right?  Let's be honest here.  Right.  Correct.  Well, this is the big boss.  He's in charge of the station.  It doesn't get any bigger than Ken.  Spaz, go ahead.  I think we should let Spaz maybe tell him why we're even calling Ken right now.  Yeah, we're bothering Ken.  He's rushing out.  Where are you, Ken? 
[00:26:00]  Like on the streets right now?  I'm in the train station waiting for a train.  Waiting for a train.  He's going back to Washington?  Philadelphia.  Oh, Philly.  That's right.  Very busy man.  He runs like, I don't know, I think he runs like 10 stations for the company.  He's flying all over the country for an infinity.  Yeah.  And Spaz wants a moment of your time.  Okay.  No problem.  Okay, Spaz, here he is.  The big boss man.  Here he is.  That you have never talked to.  You've seen him in the hall.  We've hooked you up.  We've hooked you up.  I just wanted to know if maybe you could at least say hello to each other in the hallways. 
[00:26:30]  Because I notice that sometimes you put your head down when you walk by me.  I'm sure that's not on purpose.  He's very busy when I see you in the hallway.  He's a busy man.  Absolutely.  Just if you say hello, I'll say hello.  Okay.  I just thought you didn't think I worked here or anything.  And Spaz, maybe now is a good chance, since that went so well, you could approach him  with maybe some of the other ideas you've had. 
[00:27:00]  Yes.  He doesn't sound very happy.  A relationship.  No, just a little nervous talking to the big boss.  Because we never spoke to each other before.  Yeah.  That's true.  I also had the idea of maybe just, I don't know, this is probably going too far, but hanging  out one night for a couple of beers.  So you get to know who I am.  You're right.  That's going too far.  A couple of beers. 
[00:27:30]  A couple of beers.  Like drinking buddies.  Why don't we start with a cup of coffee in the hallway?  And a hello.  And work our way up for a couple of beers.  A couple of beers.  He also wants the big, big, big, big, big boss's home number so he can talk to him  too.  That might be going too far.  I think so.  There you go.  Look at that.  A foot in the door, Spaz.  You've already had a little relationship on the phone with Ken.  Anything else?  Because he's not going to talk to you next time he sees you. 
[00:28:00]  That was worth the shot, anyway.  Any final words for Ken?  You want to maybe get him some flowers or something?  No.  No, I appreciate it and hello.  He's saying hi, Ken.  What did he say?  I appreciate it and what?  He's saying hello.  Now I guess it's your chance to reciprocate.  I can't hear him very well.  Listen, you know, stop in my office anytime.  Okay.  I will take you up on that.  Bring coffee.  We'll talk.  Yeah, okay. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, boy.  There you go, Spaz.  Make sure you're wearing your hockey helmet, Spaz.  All right, Ken.  Sorry to bother you.  No, that's okay.  Okay.  Thanks for introducing us.  No problem.  All right.  There he goes, Ken.  There he is.  He is the boss of this radio station.  How did it go, Spaz?  I think it will.  Yeah?  You feel better about your relationship now with Ken Stevens?  Well, we'll see when we pass each other the whole list.  And how about Jeremy?  Is he around? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, get Jeremy.  He's in his office.  Jeremy's here, live, so.  Yeah, Spaz gave him the finger.  Now, just to help everyone with the hierarchy here, Ken is like the man at this station.  There's no one higher.  And then Jeremy, I guess, officially would be the next in line, right?  Right.  He's in charge of the programming side of the station.  Ken is in charge of the whole station, which means programming and sales.  He is the intermediary between us and Ken, pretty much, and the rest of Infinity Management.  If we have a problem or they have a problem, Jeremy is the in-between. 
[00:29:30]  Let's put it this way.  Not to toot our own horns, but we are very, very important to this station and Ken.  And that's the most we have talked to Ken in the last month.  Right.  Yeah, that's pretty much the most we've spoken with Ken, right there.  You heard it on the air.  Because there's no reason to.  And Spaz just do the job.  Hammering out a relationship with Ken.  Must go and have beers with him.  A couple of beers.  Can you imagine them saying, Ken Stevens, the guy's waiting for a train, because he runs 
[00:30:00]  so many damn stations for this company.  And Spaz wants a few minutes of his time to have a few beers.  Ken Stevens, who, I mean, year-round going to these huge corporate meetings with other  general managers and the big bosses, the presidents and vice presidents of this company.  But if you have a couple of minutes to spend at a bar with Spaz for a couple of beers,  yeah, maybe that'll work. 
[00:30:30]  At least you tried there.  All right, now we have Jeremy in the studio.  Jeremy's here in the studio.  Now, Jeremy made it out to dinner with us last night.  Yes.  And Spaz thought, you know, that he was feeling so comfortable in front of Jeremy that he  would give him the finger.  Now, you know how when you become good friends with somebody, you start going, I F you, man.  And it's fun.  It's a joke.  But if you walked up to someone on the street and just said, F you, you'd probably get hit.  Yeah.  I got to admit, that's my surprise.  Did it?  Yeah, I was not expecting that.  I wouldn't think you would. 
[00:31:00]  Why would you expect an employee of this company who you barely have said two words to?  You haven't talked to Spaz much, right, Jeremy?  No, not very much.  We say hi in the halls, though.  All right.  There you go.  So you got that going for you, Spaz.  He actually says hi to you in the halls.  Ken does and looks the other way.  Better get that Christmas list updated.  I'm sure the cards will be being sent out now that you're saying hi in the halls.  So why did you feel that you went from just saying hi to Jeremy in the halls, not ever  really having a conversation, to giving him a finger? 
[00:31:30]  What changed that made you feel comfortable enough to go that far with your relationship  with your boss?  I didn't really notice I did it until somebody pointed out that I did it.  I was drunk.  So I turned around to Jeremy, and I said, I didn't mean to say F you, and I said the  real word.  Because I went, no, I didn't really say F you.  I just took up the middle finger.  I didn't really mean to say go F yourself.  Well, you pretty much did, though.  Now, what made you do that?  Did Jeremy say something to you or to the table that you didn't agree with?  I have no clue. 
[00:32:00]  You just felt an urge to flip off your boss.  No, because in like a couple seconds before that, Stinky was just berating me.  So Rick just said, just tell him to go F himself.  So I did.  So I had that fresh in my mind, and that's probably why I just did it.  So I caught his fire?  Yeah.  I mean, Stinky pisses you off, and you flip off your boss.  Stinky, the intern?  See, before you go out to have beers with Ken, you better make sure that you don't get 
[00:32:30]  to give him the finger.  But I apologize.  He won't be his understanding.  I apologize profusely.  I can't wait to go out with Ken and kick him in the nuts.  You're out of your mind, man.  He is out of his mind.  Everyone was in shock.  You didn't take it the wrong way, did you?  What other way?  You're in a big game.  There's a lot more way to take the finger.  Yeah.  I didn't mean it.  I don't think Jeremy's ever going out there. 
[00:33:00]  to eat with us again.  I wouldn't either.  Jeremy, how much did you have to cough up?  $80?  The boss had to cough up $80.  $80.  That's not cool.  Because Earl put in $15, and Spaz put in $20.  I put in $10 today.  Oh, please, today.  It doesn't matter.  You're still $20 short.  You're still short, yeah.  And I'd put in an extra $10 for you.  Yes.  So now what type...  Okay, get over last night.  What type of relationship would you like to have with Jeremy?  I'm not trying to bite off of you, but I want the same kind of relationship that Opie has. 
[00:33:30]  Well, they get the same kind of ratings Opie gets.  So you're thinking maybe you come in early, maybe go to the sushi place with Jeremy, talk  about the show, ideas for promotions and stuff.  Yeah, I think I'm going to have a few ideas for this station.  He's bringing in a tape.  He wants Jeremy to hear his best radio show ever, where he did a Mike Tyson impression  and stuff.  He's convinced that after Jeremy hears this tape, that Jeremy's going to suggest that 
[00:34:00]  Spaz works at one of the stations in this company.  It is true that I did learn new things about Spaz last night.  Yeah.  Like his history with his college radio station.  Yeah, we heard you were president of your college radio station.  Yes.  And the tie that I have with Jeremy is that we both went to the same intercollegiate broadcast  system convention.  Different years.  Different years.  I stood in the same train station that he once stood in.  Like going to McDonald's, dude. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  That's not a connection.  That's the same, like the building.  No, we both went to the same convention, but different years.  So it was the same type of convention.  I drank water from the same water supply.  So after doing a shot with Jeremy last night and the rest of the gang at the table, do  you feel closer to the boss?  Yes, but to be kind of drifted with the middle finger thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Might have pulled that out a little prematurely, I would say.  Yeah.  And to be honest, most people would fire you over that.  Yeah.  I hope I didn't.  You just can't give your boss the finger.  I didn't mean it, and I hope you didn't put a rift. 
[00:35:00]  A rift.  In what?  There's nothing to rift.  Okay.  I think you're thinking there's more there than is.  And know what a lot of people are starting to say about Spaz?  That he's like the single white female.  Yeah.  He's just clinging on to things and stalking.  I'm just trying to be everybody's friend.  Everybody's friend.  He's going to start eating sushi every day and, you know.  Timmy.  Wow.  All right.  All right. 
[00:35:30]  Jeremy, Spaz talked to Ken today.  Did you hear that?  Yeah, Spaz was just on the phone with Ken.  That sounded good, like they hammered out a relationship.  I think another day or two of talking to Ken, Spaz is ready to flip him off.  You got further with Ken than most employees do over years.  Yeah.  I'm sure that's thanks to Opie and Anthony, but.  Yeah.  You have talked to Ken more than him.  Yeah.  We choose.  You know why?  We choose not to talk to Ken.  It's not a good thing.  You want to avoid conversations with Ken.  Because usually if you're talking to Ken, there's a problem. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  No, I just want to be able to say hello to him and maybe say, well, how's your day going  type thing.  Just be thankful you walk the halls every day.  Don't want to, don't start relationships with the boss.  Right.  I just want to be everybody's friend.  I just want to be friendly.  I just want to be everyone's friend.  All right, Spaz.  Great job.  Thank you.  Even though it's real.  I know.  That's frightening.  So.  All right.  Thank you. 
[00:36:30]  Well, we broke the ice with you and the big boss.  There.  We'll see.  We'll see if he fires you tomorrow.  Total relationship.  He was being polite on the air.  Sakamaru just comes in shaking his head.  It's Spaz.  No one.  I know.  You are definitely crazy.  No one else around here wants Ken to talk to them.  Yeah.  If he's not talking to you, that means you're still doing a good job.  Be friendly.  He thinks this is daycare.  Go take your little rug and go take a nappy. 
[00:37:00]  It's Matt.  It's Matt.  It's his rug and Matt.  Put your coat in the cubby.  Everyone on the phones that say Spaz, you're digging yourself into it.  Yeah.  Let me talk to Bill real fast.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  Take that shovel out of his hand and give him a much smaller one.  Yeah, I know.  Because he's digging himself real fast into a grave.  Yeah.  I can't believe this guy's for real.  He's for real.  Yeah, it's frightening.  When he goes home, does he like put on a football helmet, jump in the tart cart and just go? 
[00:37:30]  I'm sorry.  What is his...  Seriously.  I don't care what you do for a living.  I mean, I think everyone could agree.  You just don't want to have a relationship with the big boss.  There are rules and ways things happen that aren't written.  He walks down the hall.  You make sure you don't even make eye contact.  You make...  You make believe you're busy and you're looking at something else.  It's true.  That's how things...  There's an unwritten way that things happen.  It's like a code.  It just happens.  You don't point out that we have to say hi in the hallway. 
[00:38:00]  Because now, when you see Ken in the hallway, do you know how friggin' awkward that's going to be?  Now, you're going to feel obligated.  He's going to feel obligated to say hi and make a point of looking at you and going, hello.  And it's not going to be real.  The way you do it is just by walking through the hall, you say, oh, hi.  And then he says hi.  And before you know it, you're just saying hi.  Is that...  Hey, Spaz, let me ask you a question. 
[00:38:30]  I think you had a shot that should have ran down your father's leg.  Oh, there you go.  All right, Bill.  I think there's only one day of the year where you could open up to the big boss.  Yeah.  Christmas party.  Ah, that's true.  There's kind of like unwritten rules there where you could get a little loose.  Everyone's drinking.  They're celebrating another fine year in the company or something.  Then maybe you could, like, have a little fun with the boss and try to let our conversation a little liquored up.  Dude, he almost blew that last Christmas. 
[00:39:00]  What do you mean?  With Scott.  Oh, our old boss.  And Scott was a hell of a lot more approachable than Ken is.  Yeah, but that's the only day, you know.  You might even get away with giving him the finger.  Yeah, the New Year's Eve phone call to Scott Herman.  Oh, Spaz, why don't you enlighten everybody on that one?  Why you felt compelled to call Scott Herman.  Scott Herman, who was the old Ken.  So, you know, the big, big, big boss man.  New Year's Eve this past, you know, a few months ago, Spaz decided to call him on New Year's Eve. 
[00:39:30]  He was still in the office.  Yeah, Infinity was worried about Y2K problems, so all the GMs had to stay at their post.  And you called him up in his office.  He had his wife and family here at a quarter to 12.  And what did you have to tell him?  I just wanted to wish him a Happy New Year and hope everything goes well.  And by a quarter to 12 on New Year's Eve, how intoxicated were you, Spaz? 
[00:40:00]  Just a little tipsy.  What are you, nuts?  Drunk, calling the boss.  Calling the big boss drunk.  On New Year's Eve at 11.45.  That's a great thing to do.  You are a brown nose.  You don't even call Aunt and I.  I didn't have your numbers at that time.  Well, thank God, but still.  You call us before the big boss, man, drunk on New Year's Eve at 11.45.  And what did he say to you? 
[00:40:30]  I got his voicemail.  He didn't even pick up.  Well, that's called screening.  That's a card, yeah.  Hello, is anyone there?  Hello.  Right.  Scott, pick up, pick up.  Yeah, do the whole thing with Scott probably doing the message.  Happy New Year.  Here's the message.  Hello, this is Scott Herman, WNDW.  Please leave your message after the tone and somebody will get back to you.  Hello, Scott.  It's Kevin. 
[00:41:00]  It's a quarter to twelve.  I'm a little tipsy.  I just want to wish you and yours a very happy New Year.  Look, Scott, pick up.  I know you're there.  Okay?  Look, I'm right downstairs and I peeked upstairs and I saw you and your family in the office.  I just want to be loved.  Is that so wrong?  Of course he was in his office.  He was right next to the phone.  Where else was he going to be?  Pick up. 
[00:41:30]  I know you're there.  I'm watching you.  You're in your chair.  I'm holding one of your sons hostage right now until you pick up.  All right.  Spaz, the single white female.  Thank you.  You're in my crosshairs, Scott.  Don't make me pull this trigger.  Pick up.  We have a guy in the line who wants to be Spaz's big brother.  He can show you some love. 
[00:42:00]  Is that the problem?  You didn't get love from Daddy?  Tony, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey, you want to be Spaz's big brother?  Yeah, I figured, you know, he needs a friend and, you know, I'm willing to have a friend.  You know, every guy should have his own Spaz.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, so long as he doesn't mind, you know, cleaning my pool and maybe doing some  weaving around the house.  Yeah.  I can have him down on weekends and, you know, maybe at the end of the summer I'll  take him to a great adventure or something.  How would you like to move my lawn?  Huh? 
[00:42:30]  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  You rule.  Hey, that's a good idea.  That's a good promotion.  What?  Be Spaz's big brother for a day.  Be his pal.  So you have to come up with a whole day of activities that you can enjoy with Spaz.  Are you my pal, Spaz?  Take him to, like, a baseball game.  Yeah.  What would you like to do with your big brother, Spaz?  I have plenty of friends.  I just like to be friendly with the people I'm with around every day.  Well, all right.  Here's a tip.  Don't try so hard. 
[00:43:00]  Just let it happen.  Yeah.  See, you can't make things like that happen.  You just made us call Ken at a train station on the way to another radio station.  So he'll say hello to you in the hallway.  He didn't have to.  Probably would have came out on his own.  You better get him some type of, you know, gift now.  That's not a 40 gift.  Like flowers or something.  Yeah.  We're not talking a night at the St. Regis, dude.  Paul Jay, maybe you should inform Spaz that one of the incentives of upper management is you don't have to have relationships with people who don't matter. 
[00:43:30]  That's so true.  Spaz just wants friends that aren't.  Hey, know how messed up that is?  That's like you and I.  What did he say?  What?  Don't even go there.  What happened?  Oh, dude.  What did he say?  What did I say?  I'm tired of that crap.  That's not true, so just lay off of it.  I missed it, though.  I said Spaz just wants to have friends that are guys that aren't banging his own.  Oh. 
[00:44:00]  They're not banging her.  Would you just cut the crap?  Jesus Christ.  This is places you don't go.  Oh, that's a whole other story that could get out of hand.  Anyway, there is no story.  Do you think Spaz is exhibiting Rupert Pupkin-like tendencies?  Yes!  Rupert Pupkin, the king of comedy.  You ever see that movie?  Robert De Niro, Jerry Lewis.  Oh, it's classic.  Rupert is delusional into thinking he's bigger than life, bigger than he is with celebrities and people. 
[00:44:30]  In the industry.  You ever see that, Spaz?  No.  You should rent that.  You should rent it.  It's pretty good.  Rent single white female.  Mm-hmm.  Rent king of comedy.  Hand that rocks the cradle.  Hand that rocks the cradle.  I've seen those, too.  And also The Jerk by Steve Martin.  Okay.  For your credit card woes.  I'd like to put those videos on my credit card. 
[00:45:00]  All right, now, we've got to take a break.  We have just begun this fine radio show of ours.  Yes.  Thanks, Spaz.  Thank you, Spaz.  Hopefully, you're in a better position now with the bosses.  And thank you, Jeremy.  Jeremy, feeling better about your relationship with Spaz?  Much better.  Thank you.  Great.  I don't know what to think.  Now, they've got to walk out of the studio together.  Just make sure you say hi to them in the hallway.  All right.  There you go, Spaz.  Look at them.  They're both walking out of the hallway.  Now, he's probably talking to them. 
[00:45:30]  Look, what I meant was...  Are you there, Doc?  Hello, Doc.  Yellow.  Ah, we lost him.  There's a psychologist checking in.  It's something serious.  And we've got to take a break.  Running very late once again today.  Yeah.  Boy, but that's some good stuff right there, huh?  Oh, my God.  All right.  Our phone line is 212-757-1027.  What do we have for the real show today, Ed?  Your brother's coming in with a song?  My brother is coming in.  He's got a couple of songs. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  One very appropriate.  Well, both of them for today.  He's got a Spaz song.  Okay.  And something that might fit into the inappropriate song contest.  All right.  That we haven't really hit on because we haven't gotten that many good songs lately.  Yes, it's a Columbine anniversary song.  Hold on to your hats.  All right.  He should be in soon with that, right?  Yeah.  We've got some audio of Bridget's waxing we've got to get to today.  Mm-hmm.  We have, I know, we have that. 
[00:46:30]  We have that.  We've got to save some nuggets for the folks.  And I think we've got to play the latest Anthony outtake tape.  Oh, great.  Good, good.  Matter of fact, we'll do that next right after this.  Stay there.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  One-on-one-seven-W-N-E-W.  All right.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Can't confirm this, but Dave from Jersey on the instant feedback.  Some chick in a pink shirt on TRL MTV just wowed on live TV. 
[00:47:00]  Really?  Wonder if that's true or not.  I'm sure we'd get a bunch of phone calls and emails about that.  If anyone can confirm that, I'm curious.  All right.  So what's going on with Elian Gonzalez?  What's the latest, Anthony?  I have no clue.  I believe they're saying he could stay in the country for the time being is the latest news.  For now.  And all those losers camping outside Elian's house down there in Miami, jumping up and 
[00:47:30]  down, crying like we just won a war or something.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  And I think after this whole thing blows over, whether he goes back or stays here for good,  no one's going to care.  Once the whole thing's done with, you think these masses of people are going to give a  flying F about him?  I don't know.  People have too much time on their hands.  Well, I mean, they announced it outside his house and they're all hugging and crying and 
[00:48:00]  giving high fives.  It's like...  Don't they have jobs?  Don't they?  Lives?  Exactly.  They obviously don't have jobs.  And lives?  Isn't there something else to rally behind?  You know how many people need help in this country?  Yeah.  And you're camping outside this kid's house day after day waiting for him to leave his  house to slide down the slide or play with that hot ant of his?  That's getting played out a little bit too, huh?  The hot ant.  The hot ant, because they need new angles with the story, so now they're all over that 
[00:48:30]  ant.  Yeah.  Like, look at the hot ant playing with the kid.  The new angle.  It is, right?  The old angle.  No one cares about him anymore.  But if you tune in CNN and all of a sudden it's like, oh, wait, the hot ant.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like a circus down there.  Because you know the kid wants to go outside and play every day, right?  Mm-hmm.  So now it's probably a big deal inside the house.  It's like, okay, everyone's waiting for us to make our appearance today.  Yeah.  You know, what are we going to do today?  Should we make believe, you know, I don't know, we'll wrestle on the front lawn for a  while and make believe that we don't have a thousand people looking at us and all the 
[00:49:00]  TV crews.  The cameras are rolling.  Right.  It's got to be so awkward.  Yeah.  So then they play for a little while and then they go back inside and then everyone waits.  Yeah.  Waits for the next appearance of the kid out in his yard.  If he sees his shadow, there'll be a...  More coverage.  Or winter or something.  I don't know how it is.  But I guess the latest, he's staying for a little while.  Yeah.  I really don't even...  I am so done with that story.  It's like, oh, who cares?  Send him back or he stays at this point. 
[00:49:30]  I don't care.  Just be done.  Whatever.  Yeah, let's...  Why is this such a huge story?  I don't know.  I really don't know anymore.  I just want that aunt to come up to New York and be lesbian for a day on the lesbo couch.  Imagine.  Get her on the lesbo couch.  I heard you.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  No, no, no, no.  She's a hoochie mama.  A hoochie mama, yeah.  She's nothing but a hoochie mama.  She's a piece of ass.  I want to tash it.  I want to tash it. 
[00:50:00]  Jillian, come here.  That's going way back on our show.  I want to tash it.  I want to tash it.  That got me in so much freaking trouble that day.  Oh, the girl is his cousin.  Whatever.  Cousin Ann.  Who cares?  Thank you, Jacob, though, for correcting us.  Yeah.  You need that accurate information here on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Right.  Does it matter?  Greg, what's going on?  Hey, I called to confirm the wowing on TRL.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I just saw it. 
[00:50:30]  I was in the kitchen getting something to eat, turn around, and it was on.  Now, was it a wow sign or actual boobs?  It was actual boobs.  Get out of here.  No, it was written on her stomach, actually.  Oh, really?  And I guess they were going to a commercial or coming from it, and I just glanced my head  and it was there.  Uh-huh.  Started laughing and ran upstairs to turn on the radio.  Oh, cool, man.  Thank you.  Yep.  Talk to you later.  All right, bye.  You guys rule.  When are the ladies going to start flashing their boobs on live TV?  There's nothing they can do.  Yeah, there's nothing they can do about it. 
[00:51:00]  Don't worry.  I think they all think they're going to go to prison if they flash the news cameras.  Yeah, Soprano makes a good point from foundrymusic.com.  How long is it going to take before the cousin poses in Playboy?  I'd pick that issue up.  Why not?  One, if I were the big boss, I'd add another year to your syndication sentence as punishment  for introducing Spaz to the big boss man. 
[00:51:30]  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  We're getting lots of requests for the latest Anthony outtake reel.  Oh, great.  Great.  This one is classic.  You had to do, what, a nine-second, what they call, don't tag, tag, right, tag.  A tag.  You know, you hear the commercial, and then at the end, it's like, you know,  you know, stop by Sunday, 4 o'clock, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So Anne had to read, like, a nine-second piece of copy about some special on wiper blades. 
[00:52:00]  It was at Strauss for Bosch Micro Excel Edge Wiper blade.  I don't know even now.  It was like a tongue twister.  It was very hard to say in one fluid sentence, like, you know, with the announcer-type voice.  Yeah.  And Psycho Mark was rolling tape.  Yeah, of course.  And here's Anthony at his best.

[00:56:00]  You know how we love doing those.  I love the hot takes.  A little rough.  The funny thing is, that's like about four minutes.  Yeah.  Psycho Mark said he had to cut it down.  He had like seven or eight minutes of material.  Yeah, he was in there eight minutes to throw down something that took ten seconds.  Nine seconds.  Yeah.  Great.  Donald from White Plains. 
[00:56:30]  There are so many bleeps in this bit, I thought a truck was backing up.  Yeah.  All right, quick break.  We'll be back.  The L.P. and Anthony Show.  The L.P. and Anthony Show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  You should have that close to you.  You never know when you're going to want to call up and comment about the crap we're talking about.  Yeah.  And Anthony, I am in such a good mood. 
[00:57:00]  Why?  My day was just made.  You heard me take that phone call during commercials.  Now I understand why.  I am so F'd this weekend, but I don't even care.  Now it's a holiday weekend.  Of course, Sunday, Easter.  Opie, you, uh...  Sunday's Easter.  Opie, you can't say F Easter.  Oh, sorry.  I like that.  I had to jump out of you.  I am in so much trouble this weekend. 
[00:57:30]  It's not even funny because you probably celebrate Easter with your family, right?  Uh, sort of, you know, I'd say.  It's whatever.  Well, at least the girlfriend, maybe.  I was, uh, I was supposed to go to, uh, brunch with Sandy and her family.  Spend some time with my family later on in the day, Sunday.  Opie, I'd like to invite you over to Easter, Easter dinner.  But I just got the call, Anthony.  Yeah.  Guess where I'll be Sunday instead of spending Easter with my girlfriend and her family 
[00:58:00]  and then, uh, spending some time with my family.  Well, it wouldn't be fair for me to guess.  For this holy, holy holiday.  I heard the phone call.  That is Easter.  I heard the call, so it wouldn't be quite fair for me.  I'm going to be at the garden with the rest of the Jews, baby.  With the Jews.  Woo!  With the, uh, Knick game.  Go, Knicks, go!  The Knick playoff game, right?  I just got the call.  Yeah.  I have a couple tickets for, uh, for Sunday's game, Anthony, as the playoffs begin.  So it's going to be Opie and, uh, Jews. 
[00:58:30]  I'm going to, I'm going to wear, uh, one of those, uh, yarmulke things on my head.  You're going to wear a yarmulke and Bobby Pin it to your hair?  I've seen, I've seen some, like, blondes with that on.  Sure.  I'll fit in somehow.  I'll have a go, Knicks, go, yarmulke on my head.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Wow.  I am so screwed.  Yeah, now wait a minute.  But you know what?  I don't even care.  What are the repercussions here?  It could be ugly, yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  Now, is Sandy going to get angry? 
[00:59:00]  Let's put it this way.  In your new groovy bachelor pad, do you have a pull-out couch, Anthony?  I may need it for a few days.  No, Opie, I'm sorry.  That's okay, just get one of those free hotel rooms.  Yeah, shut up.  Don't blow my deal.  Have spaz pay for it.  Stay at the St. Regis.  Dude, I am so screwed, and I don't even care.  Now, who did you already have plans with?  Honestly, I had serious plans.  I had a brunch to go to on Sunday with Sandy and Rick and their family. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, no.  As you know, I go out with Rick's sister.  Yes.  The lovely and talented Sandy.  So you're in big trouble.  Nice try.  Rick knows.  He's going to kick your ass.  Rick, how screwed am I?  You are screwed.  You might have to get a place with spaz.  I don't even care, man.  The family will understand, because maybe I could, like, you know, get my dad or something to go to the game.  Oh, you have two tickets.  Yeah, so that will soften the blow on my side of the family. 
[01:00:00]  So you're going to have to find somebody else that's going to piss people off.  Yes.  All right.  Yes.  I could see you taking your dad.  Amanda, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Amanda, I love you guys.  We love you.  I just wanted to say, like, I'm Jewish, and my boyfriend and all his friends love to make fun of me, because I'm Jewish.  And we just wanted to say, like, if you're Jewish, you can go to the Nick game.  No worries.  Holiday's over for us. 
[01:00:30]  I mean, I'm going out tonight, but...  Well, Jewish girls give the best hummus, by the way.  That's the word on the street.  It's the God's and his truth.  That's supposed to be true until they get married.  That's what the joke is.  Getting married.  I think the garden's going to be filled with Jews on Sunday and Opie.  And Opie.  Yes.  Absolutely.  I cannot wait.  Go, Jews.  All right, bye.  So you're not going to have...  The only reason I got the tickets was because the person that did call the show, you know, he can't use them, because he is going to, you know, celebrate the Easter. 
[01:01:00]  So now you know Easter dinner.  Look at all the people calling in.  I'll take the...  And they're all Jewish names.  Jacob, I'll take the tickets.  It's unfair to your family.  God in my sight, because I wasn't sure I was going to get some playoff tickets this year.  Opie, it's...  I would like to go with you.  Can I have the other ticket to go?  I'll buy it. 
[01:01:30]  I'll buy it.  I'll take it.  All right, well, there you have it.  Oh, the marijuana swap.  Lucky you.  Everyone's talking about 420.  It's the national holiday of pot smokers everywhere.  National holiday today of pot smokers?  420.  I know, 420.  It's 420, and the day is 420, so...  A lot of people counting on something from us, I guess.  Yeah, I guess so.  This is a quick little ditty.  We'll play it like the first minute of this.  Marijuana, marijuana, hey, hey, yeah. 
[01:02:00]  Come on, come on.  Come on, come on, hey, yeah.  Okay, okay, hey, hey.  Come on, come on.  Okay, okay, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey! 
[01:02:30]  Hey!  Now the song gets stupid after that.  The first part is really, really good, though.  Real fast, I've got to go to John.  John, what's going on, man?  Hey, Opie, this is going to be so worth it for you on Sunday, man. 
[01:03:00]  Every year I go to Motley Crue by myself, just me and 17,000 of my best friends,  and I am screwed for days for my wife, but it is worth it.  Yeah, sometimes you've just got to say, what the F?  Exactly, what the F, man.  Honey, I know I'm going to get in trouble.  I'll make it up to you.  See ya!  Yeah, best line ever uttered in the movies.  Sometimes you've got to say, what the F?  What the F?  From Risky Business?  Exactly.  I mean, who are you kidding?  Nick's?  Nick's in the Raptors Sunday at the Garden. 
[01:03:30]  I'm there.  Or a family dinner.  Or a family dinner, exactly.  Hope you're the Goldstein family checking in.  We'll see you at the Garden.  Yeah, good.  Go for it.  You guys suck, okay?  I'm going to be hanging out with all my Jewish brothers and friends Sunday at the Garden.  How stupid is it to schedule a game for Easter Sunday?  Well, they know they'll pack it out.  Come on, it's New York.  It's a melting pot.  Not everybody celebrates Easter. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Right?  Yes.  But sometimes you've just got to say, you know what?  I don't care about the consequences.  I don't know.  You'll probably be pretty screwed up, me.  Huh?  Well, I know that.  That's why I'm playing it up here on the air.  Because it will be hell.  Easter Sunday.  Yeah, but I mean.  Family functions are overrated anyway.  Oh, they really are.  And you know, like, they're probably all talking already.  Oh, it's Easter.  We finally get, you know, Opie's going to be here.  No.  Opie's going to be here. 
[01:04:30]  We're going to talk about this radio show.  No.  Tell him that, you know.  No.  I saw this guy, and he was very excited that I was going to be at this Easter get-together with Opie.  Right?  Well, I think it was Seinfeld that said it best.  Yeah.  If it wasn't Seinfeld, someone help me out with this line.  But he talks about, like, family functions and hanging out with the family.  And he says, you know, you sit there at the table, and you're looking at your family, and you think to yourself, you know,  if I wasn't related to these people, I don't think I'd ever talk to them. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  A few people have said that.  I've heard it in movies and stuff, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's true.  You know, you wouldn't just call up your uncle or your cousin or something if they weren't your uncle or cousin and say,  hey, you want to hang out?  No, but unless you're spaz and it's your boss.  Right.  I'm just talking normal people.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  Nick Sunday for the Opie.  Well, you have fun.  I'll look for you in the crowd shots, Opie.  Who are you kidding?  I don't think you're...  Are you hanging out with your family this year?  Yeah.  Really?  I'm going out to my mommy's house out there on Long Island. 
[01:05:30]  I'm blowing you off, too, because I was supposed to see you jamming at Sgt. Pepper's Sunday.  No, that's Saturday night.  Oh, all right.  I'll still be there.  You could show up Saturday night.  I'll be there Saturday.  Sgt. Pepper's Pub out there in...  What the hell is that?  It's like Comac, East North Port border, somewhere around there.  Right.  Nice little place.  Yeah, we're just going to, like, hang out.  You're showing up, Rick, right?  I'm coming.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And I'll be there supporting you.  Can I carry your equipment? 
[01:06:00]  Ah, you're cordially invited.  Speaking of which, is your brother getting here soon or what?  He's got a...  He's better, that son of a bitch.  He's got, like, a couple of new songs.  I don't know where the hell he is.  He's got a Columbine song that's just going to get us in all sorts of trouble today.  Well, it's the anniversary, one-year anniversary of that Columbine tragedy,  and he wrote a song about it.  I don't know.  I don't think it glorifies it.  I think it shows the two murderers for what they are.  All right.  Psychopaths.  And we are wrapping up the Most Offensive Song contest, so... 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, this might do it.  So this is...  That whole contest is coming to an end in the very near future.  You thought Oh, Mein Fuhrer was bad.  Really?  This one's even worse?  I don't know.  No, it's pretty bad.  You should see the stack of letters on Ken's desk...  Yeah.  ...over the Most Offensive Song contest.  Who's bitching?  People have finally woken up.  Can we say they're bitching?  Screw them.  Women.  They absolutely hate the Opie and Anthony show.  The letter starts off...  I can't believe they're still on the air. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, we had a run-in with them years back in Boston.  And they're...  Oh, they're very curious as to why we're still on the air?  Yeah.  Because now it doesn't run the planet...  Whores.  So they're one of the many letters that have made it to Ken's desk over the Most Offensive  Song contest.  What a bunch of stereotypical Now members.  Like the members of Now, you will not find one attractive woman in the lot.  It's like that story we were watching last night on CNN. 
[01:07:30]  You know that woman that likes to work out in her garage?  Well, what are you pointing out there?  What do we got out there?  Oh, boy.  I think we have to take a break, Anthony.  What's the problem?  Go talk to him real fast.  What's the problem?  Hello, Anthony.  Who's here?  We just got the ixnay on the wow-a gesture outside the studio.  I don't understand why you can't talk about an organization. 
[01:08:00]  Well, anyway, last night, we were watching that CNN, and they had this woman that likes  to work out pretty much naked in her garage.  I think we all saw the footage.  Oh, my God.  CNN ran that about 100 times yesterday.  CNN was like the Spice Channel yesterday.  They're showing this woman that likes to work out in her garage and in her yard pretty much  just naked.  Yeah.  She wears, I don't know what she wears.  She wears tiny little workout outfits.  She's got a killer body.  She likes to dance in her driveway and stuff, and it does all this provocative dancing. 
[01:08:30]  She's got a flagpole in the front yard, and she does, like, stripper club pole dances  on the thing.  Yeah.  She gets a leg around it and spins down it and everything, and all these neighbors are  bitching and complaining, but they're all videotaping her.  They all have hours of videotape of this woman working out, and they went to some town meeting  trying to get her to stop, and the bottom line is they can't make her stop.  She's got a right to do what she wants to do, but every woman that was bitching about 
[01:09:00]  this woman was such a frigging pig.  It was amazing.  There's one woman testifying, it's disgusting, despicable.  I can't believe it.  Meanwhile, she's got hours of videotape of this woman, and she just, she probably obviously  wishes she had an attractive body like this woman.  Yeah.  She likes to work out outside.  There weren't any hot Playboy models complaining about this girl exercising.  I would love that.  Imagine that.  You walk outside, and your neighbor's, this hot chick, and she's working out outside in 
[01:09:30]  this little workout outfit.  Does it mind being videotaped?  That's a dream.  The cameras are rolling all over the place.  That's a dream come true.  The footage they showed on CNN last night was amazing, and then they go back to the  serious news guy, and he's doing the news with that lady.  I forgot their names.  Yeah.  He's like, ho, ho, ho.  And the guy, he couldn't help himself.  He comes back, and he was just like, what?  You know he wanted to say, wow, does that rock.  I'm spanking out a batch during this next commercial break.  Right.  Fantastic.  The moves this lady was doing in her front yard, and the neighbors all filming it, trying 
[01:10:00]  to get her to stop.  I'd be like Desi Arnaz with the three-camera shoot.  I'd have cameras set up.  Right.  I'd be a director with the headphones on.  Okay, go to camera three.  Three.  Yeah.  All right, squeeze it, freeze it, let's go to break.  That would be me.  She was on the pole upside down, which was classic.  Yeah.  The flagpole.  Hands hanging down to her chin.  It was...  The thing is, the women that were complaining, not one looker in the bunch.  Yeah.  Al, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, Oney? 
[01:10:30]  How are you?  Not too bad, man.  Good.  Listen, she's actually a stripper at night.  Yeah, no crap.  So that's what she does is practice, but what they also said was that the police department  is directly across the street from her house, and there's nothing that they can do about  it because she's not breaking any laws.  No, I'll tell you what's going on.  There's nothing the police want to do about it.  Yeah.  We've met the boys in blue.  They would love to check out something like that across from their station house.  Oh, absolutely.  All right, listen, go to run, guys.  Take care.  All right, Al.  Bye.  I had boring neighbors growing up. 
[01:11:00]  That's the type of neighbor I wanted growing up.  Opie Star Jones checking in.  Yeah.  Wants to know if you could bring a bucket of chicken to the game.  If you're going to be gone, because she'll be there, too.  Yeah, no problem.  All right, and we've got to take a break.  Where's Opie with my chicken?  All right, another pot.  Oh, that's good.  Another pot song as we go into commercials here, Anthony.  Your brother's here with that Columbine song.  Thank God.  We'll get to him next.  We're looking for a few good enemas.  What the hell are you talking about? 
[01:11:30]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Crap, whiz, and vomit.  1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027 is our phone line.  You never know who's going to stop on by the studio.  Yes.  It's Cowbell Bill.  Cowbell Bill.  Of course, his good friends are always calling up saying, I know Cowboy Bill.  Cowboy Bill.  No, it's Cowbell Bill.  I don't think anyone wants to be known as a cowboy.  No.  Cowboy Bill.  Oh.  Hey.  In the tri-state area. 
[01:12:00]  Cowboy Bill.  Yeah.  No, it's Cowbell Bill.  My brother Joe.  I've been by, too.  Brought out a brand new song.  Look at that.  Old bandmate from years gone by.  Joe Gruen.  Yes.  Joe.  Hey, what's up?  Original founding member of Rotgut.  How about that?  Which, by the way, is selling quite a few CDs up on eBay.  Oh, really?  How about that?  It's silly.  These people are paying like $43 to $50 for a CD.  There's a new listing, one from New Pulse. 
[01:12:30]  Really?  Yeah.  There are two up there now.  When they could just go to MP3 and download them from Joe.  Yep.  Yep.  Actually, from Rotgut at MP3, you can download every song for free.  And if you want a CD, you can buy them there for $12.99.  Are you and Joe Gruen in litigation about money on any of this songs?  I'm going to be putting the videos up.  Oh, my God.  Thank God I don't have a legitimate radio career.  That's my job.  By the way, somebody is putting up autographed Rotgut Live at the Apollo CDs. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, yeah?  So I have to talk to you after the show.  Oh, really?  How about that?  I don't know if I could spell Romeo Manson anymore.  I'll coach you.  You just need to sign a few.  Yeah, just sign a few.  Just sign a few.  You bunch of bad dudes.  Just initiate them.  Writing the code tells.  Well, I wouldn't want to give you the impression that I am a bitter, tin-knocking brother, Anthony.  I looked at the clock yesterday when I said that.  I thought you were home already. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  I thought maybe you were out of range.  You never know.  You never know what I'm going to hear.  How about that, though?  The guy from Filter?  I know.  The brother is...  Who's his...  What's his last name?  His brother's...  Patrick.  The guy from Terminator 2.  The guy that played the cop.  Oh, that guy.  The cop from...  The liquid metal guy.  Oh, get out of here.  You can tell they totally look alike.  They look exactly alike.  Wow.  I've never seen the guy from Filter.  I don't know what he looks like.  Yeah, yesterday he made the eye and stuff.  He did like the eyebrow thing.  He looked just like him.  Yeah.  I mean, it's his brother, for God's sake.  That's funny.  But that's got to be cool.  You know, we were talking about that. 
[01:14:00]  It's like, you know, wow, I'm the singer of Filter, and you're in, you know, movies and  stuff.  That's why I brought that up, Joe.  Well, you know...  Hey, Joe is probably one of the best sheet metal cutters ever.  You would probably have to use the same cheesy joke if the Baldwin Brothers came in, too.  Right.  Thank you.  I'm glad you understand.  Oh, yeah.  There goes Anth changing the subject.  There you go.  Oh, come on.  So you guys brought in a couple songs, I say.  Yes.  Yeah.  A couple more songs to get us in trouble.  And I must give props to Sister Dawn. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, my sister's actually singing on this one.  And she did a spectacular job.  Much easier to coach vocally than you, by the way.  Ah, get out of here.  Well, you were a little bitter when you were in rock, God.  You guys could be like the new Osmonds between Ed and Joe and your sister, you know?  Why not?  The retarded Osmond.  Come on.  I don't know, man.  Now, okay, look.  There's one song that's about spaz. 
[01:15:00]  It's a fun little up-tempo goddamn number.  Is Don on the phone?  What about those pictures I was supposed to see?  Two.  Two.  Ponderous.  Effing ponderous.  Now, there's a happy-go-lucky spaz thing on crap.  Two, Opie.  Two.  Two.  I got it.  It's fun.  This one I had a whip up after listening to, you know, what went on yesterday and back  out of it today.  I just had.  Kevin, it's nothing personal.  It's strictly business, Kevin.  Nothing personal.  Strictly business. 
[01:15:30]  So, what's the name of the spaz song?  It's a quick one.  It's about a minute long.  These are done.  Grab the cannolis.  Spaz a califragilistic.  It's done to the Mary Poppins.  Mary Poppins.  I love Mary Poppins.  Yeah, it's done to the Mary Poppins song, supercalifragilistic, expialidocious.  Okay.  You know?  And it's a spaz a califragilist.  Yeah, that's the fun one.  All right.  Let's just get through the fun one.  All right.  Before we get to the one that's going to be a problem. 
[01:16:00]  The other one's fun, too.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not enough time has passed.  I was going to do it.  If you remember, we were at a barbecue over at Anthony's house when I first mentioned  this song last year.  Oh, we laughed really hard.  A day after it happened.  Right.  And we said it was too close.  No, no, no.  Opie actually said he would play it.  He said record it.  He said record it.  I'll play it.  I will definitely play it.  All right.  Let's play the spaz one first here, okay? 
[01:16:30]  Okay.  This is a happy, fun spaz is an idiot song.  It's stupid child's father, Nick, when I mean, makes me nauseous.  Don't know why we keep him with the trouble that he causes.  Minds alone with brain damage and thought brought this on policy.  It's stupid child's father, Nick, when I mean, makes me nauseous.  It makes me nauseous.  Young little idiot, a dumb little guy.  It's dumb little idiot, a dumb little guy.  They call him Kevin K.  Gox spaz when he picks up the phone.  Don't expect an answer, cause his brain cells are all blown.  How'd he get his job without one?  Hey, well, I don't know. 
[01:17:00]  He's the biggest third you ever heard on New York radio.  He's stupid child's father, Nick, when I mean, makes me nauseous.  Don't know why we keep him with the trouble that he causes.  Minds alone with brain damage and thought brought this on policy.  It's stupid child's father, Nick, when I mean, makes me nauseous.  Dumb little idiot, a dumb little guy.  Dumb little idiot, a dumb little guy.  Dumb little idiot, a dumb little guy.  Dumb little guy.  Oh, there you go.  That's a pretty good job.  Props to Sister Dawn.  Yeah, Dawn doing a great job on that.  I didn't have a chance to call her. 
[01:17:30]  She wanted me to call.  Well, actually, she was saying while we were doing it, she was saying, cause she had, well,  she had something to do with the other song that we're going to be playing.  Yeah.  And she said, I want to be completely anonymous for that one.  Yeah, she's smart.  But she wanted me to call her.  She wants to be completely anonymous, but she wants me to call her so she can tell everybody  that she's with to listen to the radio, cause it's her on.  Of course.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, that was fun, right?  Oh, that was good.  That little Mary Poppins thing, little English accent thing was kind of cute.  My wife Colleen was in the chorus, too.  Oh, really? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  I had a whole production going on.  What are you, accepting an Emmy right now?  I thought Ed Wynn and Dick Van Dyke were going to stop in any minute.  Which brings us to the next track.  Now, this one, well, it is the anniversary, one year anniversary of the tragic Columbine high  school shootings, hoping.  Well, there's people commenting about the first song, so let's...  Oh, really?  Let's slow down the...  Slow down. 
[01:18:30]  Let's slow down a little bit.  Let it all soak in.  Uh-oh.  One step at a time.  Tom has a comment about this fast song.  Tom, what's up?  What's up, guys?  That is one of the funniest damn things I've ever heard.  That's pretty good.  You know what's funny about it?  It's all true.  That's what makes it great.  Squeezed into a clever little catchy ditty.  You'll be singing that one.  All right, man.  Two in the morning, you'll get up to take a lick, all right?  Ben, we'll be playing that one a lot.  Stupid, shallow, spaz, the nitwit. 
[01:19:00]  Yes.  All right, well, let's move on to the next one.  Okay, and I think this actually qualifies as an entry into one of the most tasteless song  contests.  I thought it would be a cross-genre parody.  Oh, but I might have a problem with this.  If it wasn't for the fact that it does not glorify the killings in any way.  It definitely doesn't glorify?  No, it puts them in the perspective that they are killers.  I think we need to go to the phones before we play this song.  Oh, why? 
[01:19:30]  It's no race or anything.  It's a song about Columbine.  Yeah.  One year anniversary today.  About those two dastards, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.  Yeah.  Or was it Dylan Harris and Eric Klebold?  I don't remember.  Whatever.  Who cares?  Whatever.  Those two a-holes.  Yeah, see?  Nobody likes them.  It's not a song that is in a favor of them.  Not at all.  It's a little song that documents what happened a year ago.  And it could be turned into a sitcom.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Well, the most offensive song contest is coming to an end, so.  Yeah.  I just start sweating before we have to play these songs.  You haven't heard this one, right?  It's not that good.  I remember the verse he sung at your barbecue.  So I can only imagine what it came up with after that.  Hey, Hopi, it's done to the fun song, the theme song to the old Patty Duke show.  Remember that?  They're cousins, two of a kind.  Now everyone's yelling at us on the phone lines.  We'll give them their time here. 
[01:20:30]  Andrew, what's going on?  I'm a student myself, and I just say, play the effing song.  I'm perfectly fine with it.  There you go.  Coming from a student.  Who are we going to say?  It just makes me feel better that the listeners are on board with us, Anthony.  That's all I'm trying to say.  That's all.  That's all I'm trying to say.  If you think about it, really.  If you think about it.  Let's go to Nick.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey, O.A., just play the song.  Come on.  Go to the balls.  Come on, play the song. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  Thank you.  They're going to play the song in the 5 o'clock hour.  Oh, no.  No tease.  No tease is like certain people that work in this market.  No, no.  Hey, we'll be playing that Columbine song.  A week later, they'll finally get to it.  Play the song, you pussy.  There's a bunch of people checking in.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, Opie, man.  Why are you such a pussy, man?  Just play the song.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  All right.  So it's done to the Patty Duke theme?  Yeah.  Okay.  And it's a little tribute to Columbine. 
[01:21:30]  Is it a tribute?  What is it?  I didn't say a tribute.  I think it's like a chronicle of what happened to your guy.  It's a documentation.  Yes.  A docusong.  Oh, that's the original, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And mind you, I did not have this one to record over.  I record all of it from scratch.  It's a very happy tune.  For sure. 
[01:22:00]  No, no, no, no.  Crazy.  Crazy.  Buzzing.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, listen to this outline.  A hot dog makes a lose control. 
[01:22:30]  Wow.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Okay, terrific.  Whoa, whoa.  Remember that?  Oh, you're very naughty.  And everybody had their favorite.  It was either Kathy or Patty.  I liked Kathy.  I happened to think Kathy was much hotter than Patty. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  She was more innocent.  She had a nicer butt.  More bangable.  Yeah, you know, it was the same goddamn chick.  The same chick.  And for some reason, I think everybody liked Kathy a little more.  She seemed a little more distant, like you could, not as obtainable.  Right.  Patty was just a slut bitch.  You know, Patty, well, a hot dog made her lose control.  Patty liked the rock and roll.  A hot dog made her lose control.  A hot dog made her lose control.  Remember the little brother, Ross?  No, Joe. 
[01:23:30]  Somehow, Ross stuck in your head?  I do.  Yeah.  I remember Ross.  Girl, Patty or Kathy, I like little young Ross.  Yeah.  Those big oversized glasses.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like to take him out with a roll of duct tape and a spade shovel.  All right, so that's the original Patty and Duke song, Anthony.  Yes.  We were going to voice over that, but it just...  Very cheesy.  Yeah.  Very tinny, high-end, very hard.  Some of you were a cowbell bill.  We sat down, we popped a couple of nuggets, and we put our balls to the wall.  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  The funny thing about these songs, yeah, you guys just lay down all the music and everything  yourselves.  Well, you know, you got ten hours, let's do it.  Yeah, exactly, which shows, I was going to say, not just talent, but your total lack  of life.  Take the time to orchestrate the Patty Duke tune.  Well, we appreciate it, because we get song parodies all the time, and people are just  trying to sing over the original song.  Right, yeah.  The other...  That doesn't work.  The other vocals in the background.  Bill comes up with this patch called a vocal eliminator.  Actually, I came up with it.  It's a vocal eliminator in the VS-880, which is one of the machines that we use. 
[01:24:30]  It takes the voice out.  No, it takes everything out but the voice.  We put the thing on the set, vocal eliminator, and we're listening back, and everything but  the vocals is gone.  Straighten that out, Roland.  You did a great job.  Well, a case of being later, here you go.  Yeah.  And like we said before, it's kind of a little chronicle of what happened a year ago at Columbine,  the tragedy of Columbine.  Dylan and Eric.  Done to the Patty Duke tune.  Those two morons. 
[01:25:00]  And here we go, Anthony.  Here's Dylan who liked an M-16 with high-capacity magazines.  But Eric liked to build a bombs and raise a bomb in the middle time.  What a crazy pair.  They were killers.  Yes, iconic villains all the way.  Shot up their school in Trent's Coast one year ago today.  While Dylan picked out a chocolate stick. 
[01:25:30]  An F-B-Jew, some religious chick.  Eric goes out of control, the shotgun that's still giving roles.  What a couple of pricks.  They were killers.  Yes, iconic villains.  And you'll find.  They walked their life.  They must have been held up too tight.  And they took their own lives.  They were killers.  They were killers.  Who's that Columbine? 
[01:26:00]  Okay, terrific.  I thought that song was coming in a lot earlier than that.  The dump song.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Does that qualify for the most offensive song?  Well, I think so.  Well.  It doesn't glorify them at all, though.  You actually call them pricks in the song. 
[01:26:30]  That's right.  Which, of course, justifies everything.  I think they were.  Well, that's great.  I mean, safely, just click a couple of bells.  That's just great.  That's good.  Anybody?  People emailing in, Joe Soprano, I'm going to have to withdraw myself from this song.  Stupid, you're so stupid.  Oh, love it.  People loving it.  Okay, horrific.  Yeah.  I love it.  Ah, the review's coming in on the phone, Anthony. 
[01:27:00]  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, Mike.  Yellow.  Yellow.  They're speechless on the phone, see?  Hey, Mike, you there?  Yeah.  Hi, Mike.  That was effing ponderous.  Ponderous.  But I loved it.  All right, thank you.  Yeah.  What are the reviews saying on the Instant Feedback, Anthony?  Any that you can read?  Well, back to back, we got a yay, we got a winner, and well, that sucked.  Great job.  It rocked.  Okay, terrific. 
[01:27:30]  Well, it was fun listening to you.  Hope they replace you with some interesting people.  Oh, sweet Jesus, that was funny.  Mixed reviews.  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on, man?  How are you?  That song wasn't offensive enough.  It can't be the most offensive song.  All right.  Well, it wasn't really meant to be.  It wasn't meant to be an offensive song.  It's just a little documentation of a very tragic day in U.S. history.  Oh, that's all well and good, but you can't play it for the most offensive song. 
[01:28:00]  No, that wasn't the idea.  You said it may be an entry.  Right.  Oh.  All right.  That isn't close.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  You want to hear Joe's most offensive song?  Jermaine, what's going on?  Jermaine.  Hello.  Yo.  Plenty.  Huh?  No, play that song again.  It was good.  You like it?  Play it again.  Yeah.  All right, Jermaine.  Thanks.  Stephen Lynch is better, though.  Huh?  Stephen Lynch is better, though.  All right.  All right.  We'll see you.  All right.  You guys suck.  Bye-bye. 
[01:28:30]  So do you.  You apologize.  Aw, look, Joe hasn't been on the air enough to know.  Don't take it personally.  Yeah, don't take it personally.  You should see the stuff that they said about us every day.  It's great.  Nick, what's going on?  I love that song.  It's my favorite song of all time.  You have to play it every single day.  All right.  See?  Thank you, Nick.  People love it.  Thanks.  Let's go to Jeremy.  Is this our boss, Jeremy?  I hope not.  No, it's a different Jeremy.  Oh, thank God.  What's up?  I just wanted to thank you guys for a great two years.  It's been great listening to you.  I don't know what I'm going to do without you. 
[01:29:00]  All right, Jeremy.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  You guys suck.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah, some people are saying, of course, Old Mind Fuhrer was a lot worse.  Well, of course.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's up?  What's up, bro?  How are you?  What's up, man?  Virgin.  Yo, I like that stuff, bro.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  All right, Virgin.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  What a tool.  Virgin.  Yeah.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  That was pretty rough.  I mean, it wasn't that offensive.  It was just pretty rough. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  You're going to get the Christian Coalition after you guys now with that one.  I think the whole thing was just that it was put to such a happy, fun-loving song.  Yeah.  It made a little fun-loving Columbine song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You guys roll, bro.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Have a good one.  Bye.  Bye.  Joanne, what's going on?  That song sounds like a sick advertisement.  For a new wacky sitcom.  Oh, my God.  Wacky sitcom?  That was sick.  We understand that.  I have to tell you guys that you guys are great. 
[01:30:00]  No matter what sick stuff you play, because I heard about you talking about women's groups.  Yeah.  And I'm a woman, and I'm also a therapist, and I still listen to you guys.  I find you guys great.  We have a lot of ladies listening to us, and we appreciate that.  You know, I was there to pick up the WWF tickets you guys gave me, and they wouldn't let me  downstairs to meet you, because they told me I'd degrade myself.  Oh, you'd degrade yourself.  Yeah.  I begged to come down and say hi, and thank you for the tickets.  I was with my sister, and they said, oh, no, you don't want to degrade yourself.  If they didn't let you down, that just means that, well, let's go. 
[01:30:30]  You guys are doing something bad.  No, let's just put it politely that you're not a looker.  I'm not a looker?  Maybe that's it.  Do you have large breasts?  Yeah.  We have, like, a roadie.  I'm not ugly, thank you.  Okay.  This show, Ann and I, it's like a band.  We have roadies that check out the girls that stop by for prizes.  Yeah.  And then, you know, there's a whole...  They come down from the lobby and report.  Yeah, there's a whole system that we've looked at.  They didn't even come down.  They just said you don't want to degrade yourself. 
[01:31:00]  Wow, that's not a good sign.  That's not very nice.  That's not good.  I don't even know what I look like.  Yeah, well, that's not a good sign, Joanne.  What?  That's not a good sign.  I used to do modeling.  Really?  You want to play What's in My Pants?  No.  What kind of modeling?  Chips in a bottle?  Airplane?  Now you're getting sick.  All right, Joanne.  Thank you.  Well, take care, guys.  All right, bye.  Bye.  We need to play What's in My Pants today because we have a brand new intro to the game.  Oh, yeah, okay, let's get a girl on the phone that wants to play Guess What's in My Pants. 
[01:31:30]  We've got a lot of people here to play today.  Is that something we can all play?  Of course.  Cool.  You ever play What's in My Pants?  I've played from home.  I see a lot of people playing at home.  They play along at home.  I have the home version.  The home version.  Tom, what's going on?  You received the home version.  Hey.  You guys could forget about syndication in that state.  Yeah, well, we've already given up on syndication anywhere.  Never mind Colorado.  All right, thank you.  Syndication, forget about it.  All right.  Forget about it.  Colorado, right?  James, what's going on? 
[01:32:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm going to miss you.  I really am.  All right, James.  Hey, but one second.  Can I get some wild stickers?  Just send a self-addressed stamped envelope.  We're sending out the brand new stickers to everyone that sends in a self-addressed stamped envelope.  Over and out, Diamond Dust.  All right.  I did.  I think the address is on the NAW website, hopefully, okay?  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, what's going on?  I'm waiting for a lady to play What's in My Pants so we can play our brand new intro.  Listen, turn that phone again for me.  I didn't get to hear it.  I was coming in the house.  Ah, there you go. 
[01:32:30]  All right, we'll play it one more time.  All right, and it wasn't really funnier than Oh Mine Fear.  That's the freaking funniest song I've ever heard.  Funny.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Wow, this guy is just a genius.  Ah, the adulation.  Joe, any song parodies maybe about JonBenet to the theme song for Punky Brewster?  Maybe.  So you can mull that around in your head?  Hey, Joe, how about you start doing song parodies that we can play more than once on our show?  Well, I have one here that you guys couldn't even play once.  Which one?  It was called Homo No. 1. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, we couldn't play that one.  I don't know.  Have the reins been loosened a little bit?  Not for Homo No. 1.  Homo No. 1 still hasn't made it.  We can't even play dry, dry, dry, you know what.  I have that, too.  We can't do that?  No, we can't play that anymore.  You know what?  We can probably play it, and then Opie pull down the fader at the vag part, and we'll all  just go, uh, uh, uh.  And then I had the more than words.  That might not work the same.  But I had the more than words for Valentine's Day that you guys couldn't play. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, we couldn't play that either.  You write some filthy-ass songs, Joe.  That's what it is.  I would guess.  What we have to do is get all those tracks on the unofficial website, finally.  Yeah.  Homo No. 1 is hilarious.  Absolutely hilarious.  I do have the Tom Jones tune right here.  You have all the tact of a rototill when you write these things.  All right, Ant, listen.  We've got to take a quick break.  Yeah.  We have to, uh, play What's in My Pants, because we have a brand new intro we want to  try out on the show.  We got, um, a girl? 
[01:34:00]  Uh, yeah.  Oh, Paulina.  Yeah.  Well, we have a bunch of them.  We'll choose one in a minute here.  All right.  One more time.  For giggles here.  Which one?  No.  Columbine?  Yeah, okay.  Just in case you missed it.  All right.  Like I said, I don't think it is.  And it's Sister Dawn on the vocal.  I don't think it glorifies it, I think.  As we go to commercials, uh, I believe this will be the last time you hear this song on  our show.  For nuggets for commercials.  Oh, next year.  All right.  Here it is.  It's, uh, it's Joe and Cowbell Bill and Dawn and shot right off to the website after this, 
[01:34:30]  uh, airing.  There you go.  We'll be back to play What's in My Pants with one of the girls on the line.  Here's Dylan who liked an M-16 with high-capacity magazines.  But Eric liked to build a bunch of ways and all the girls on.  What a crazy band.  They were killers.  Yes, iconic villains all the way.  Shot up their school in Trench Coast one year ago today. 
[01:35:00]  While Dylan picked out a chocolate stick, an epping Jew, some religious chick.  Well, Eric was out of control, shot up some living holes.  What a couple of pricks.  They were killers.  Yes, iconic villains that you'll find.  They walked alike.  They must have been hung up too tight.  And they took their own lives. 
[01:35:30]  They were killers.  Lose that Columbine.  Kobe.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Anthony.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of folks.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  All right, today hanging out with Anthony's brother, Joe.  Yes.  Cowbell Bill.  Cowbell Bill.  Joe Gruen.  Joe Gruen.  Joe Gruen.  I haven't seen it in quite some time. 
[01:36:00]  Joe, good seeing you again.  You have the equivalent of the kids' table microphone down at the end of the counter.  Like everyone has their seniority when they come in.  Bill has worked very hard to earn his spot right next to me here.  That's the same seat that Richard Patrick from Filter was sitting in yesterday, Bill.  Oh, yeah.  Should feel privileged.  Joe writing many songs, but I don't think has as many appearances live on the air.  You have many more in song parody.  But that's why Joe has a wife.  Because I have a wife. 
[01:36:30]  Joe Gruen.  Joe Gruen at the kiddie table down there.  Good seeing you again, though, man.  Yeah.  I've seen you in a while.  In a while.  I was saying, Joe, I have a video of Anthony upstate.  We were playing in a club in Boston, Rockout, years ago, and Anthony humping Joe Gruen and  smacking him over the head with a bouquet of flowers at the same time.  That was before the show.  Hanging off his back while he was playing guitar. 
[01:37:00]  I wouldn't talk, pigtail wearer.  That's right.  Who was wearing pigtails on stage?  I had a real faggy hair there.  I did.  You guys had a great sight.  Well, it was an outrage.  Joe sent me to this barbershop.  Remember that one?  Joe sent me to this barbershop.  What was that haircut's name?  Rob?  Rob, yeah.  Rob the haircut.  You sent me there.  This is going back a few years.  He sends me there, and I had really long hair, almost down to my ass.  Joe sends me over there, and he has this guy, Rob, cut my hair and put these French twist 
[01:37:30]  braids in it.  Hey, hey.  We had to play Sparks that night, so I was like, oh, no, it looks too fig.  I started taking the things out, and it looked even worse.  It was like I had these two things coming out of the side.  That's when I started with the pigtails.  I guess you still never got that that was a joke.  You got me good, brother.  Hey, Joe, we were talking about Homo No. 1 earlier, a song, unfortunately, we cannot  play on our show.  That was a very serious work of mine. 
[01:38:00]  It's not a legal song.  It's a day minor, the saddest of all cases.  Homo No. 1 is located on the page SoundClips1 on foundrymusic.com.  The NFL will be an Anthony website.  SoundClips No. 1, if you want to hear Homo No. 1, a song that we wish we could play  in the air, but we just can't.  So many.  I wish we could squeak past that Dry Vag song.  Yeah.  The Dry Vag song is hilarious.  Is that on the unofficial website, too?  It used to be.  It used to be?  Maybe if Steve's listening, he could pop that one up there so people could really get it. 
[01:38:30]  Joe singing like Tom Jones right up until his nut pops.  I think that's how I gave myself a hernia.  If Steve's listening, maybe we could feature some of the musical stylings of Joe, Anthony's  brother, on the unofficial website for the weekend.  Like the Dry Vag song, the Homo No. 1, and the other ones that we can't play in the air.  Joe can be seen stapling stack heads.  Oh, shut up.  Any weekday.  At True Mechanicals. 
[01:39:00]  You're going to make me bitter.  Come on.  I'm kidding with you.  Make you bitter?  I'm kidding with you, man.  He's going to turn me into a bitter old man.  Hey, Bob.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  We're doing all right.  I figured you guys out.  Totally.  What?  You're trying to get thrown off the radio in New York.  That's what everybody thinks.  We're all really sophisticated, guys.  Whatever market we're in, everybody thinks we have that same plan.  Listen, it's the greatest market in the world.  You get yourself thrown out.  You go to a new town.  In a week, two weeks, you get back in New York. 
[01:39:30]  We couldn't live without you.  Uh-oh.  No, we're not trying to get thrown off.  No.  Believe it or not.  Believe it or not, we have some A-bombs.  I wish you would.  If you wanted to get thrown off, we have the atomic bombs.  Bring it on.  Hey, guys.  I can't wait.  But that was true in the past.  Ant and I, yes, we did try to get thrown off all the radio stations.  See, actually, it's me.  Amazing.  Guys, have a great day, all right?  All right, Bob.  Take care.  It's me.  It's bitter brother Joe trying to get them thrown off the air.  Yeah, see, Joe's writing these songs.  Oh, Anthony, we have an opening at True Mechanical. 
[01:40:00]  I come back.  I kept your snips.  Oil up your snips, buddy.  Kept your snips.  All right, you guys want to play What's in My Pants?  Yeah, not in your pants.  Well, I know, but that's the name of it.  We will take some calls and talk to some girls.  Shut up.  That's the name of the game.  I don't care.  What's in all these pants of Vienna sausage?  We got a brand new intro to the game.  Roll it out.  Let's hear it.  What's in my pants?  I just want to thank Jimmy working very hard for the show behind the scenes to come up  with some of these fun little ditties and stuff, okay?  Nothing's better for a little game than a theme song. 
[01:40:30]  A theme, yeah, like an intro.  Yeah.  Intro to the game.  Check it out.  We're debuting it today.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to play.  That's it, huh?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Coming.  Coming.  All right, there you go, Archie.  All right. 
[01:41:00]  You want to tell everyone the rules of the game, what's in my pants?  Well, it's very simple.  We go to the phones, lovely young lady on the other end.  We ask her to remove her pants and underwear and then take the phone she's speaking on  and rub it on her most intimate of areas.  Correct.  And we will try to guess what style haircut she has by her bearded clamp.  There you go.  And people love playing at home.  Yeah, the choices are triangle, mohawk, Hitler mustache. 
[01:41:30]  And there's a little confusion.  We might as well get this out of the way.  What is the difference between a Hitler mustache and a mohawk?  I'll explain.  A Hitler mustache starts as a mohawk, but then you shave the top of it down so it's very  small.  A tongue.  Hence, like a mustache.  Yes, hence, like Hitler's mustache.  Don't forget that the pool rack filled with afro hair because Capno Bill is here.  Yeah, that's the biggest triangle ever.  You know what?  You rack the balls up on a pool table, right?  You take that, you fill it with afro hair and shove it in your lap. 
[01:42:00]  If it looks like that, that's a biggie.  And, of course, wood floor.  Wood floor.  Which is just the Jean Benet.  Yeah.  Oh.  Come on.  I thought the Hitler mustache was just a little patch on top, like a lollipop.  A lollipop.  No, no.  No?  No, it's not.  It's like a little, like, rectangle.  Hitler mustache, yeah.  Who the hell is chewing gum?  Joe.  Yeah, what are you doing, Joe?  The listeners are hating you.  It's radio, for God's sake. 
[01:42:30]  Buttnut checking in.  If you want to play What's in Opie's Pants, he wants to guess.  Spaz his hand.  That's pretty good.  All right.  So do we want to play with Rebecca, Elaine, Paulina, or Jennifer?  Or Rhiannon?  Let's see.  Who's going to be the best?  We don't even know.  I don't want line four.  You don't want line?  Oh, okay.  I just don't want to say that name.  Okay.  Line four is out.  How about Paulina? 
[01:43:00]  Paulina, that's good.  Let's see what Paulina has.  Paulina!  Yes?  Are you in your car?  My boyfriend's driving.  What?  My boyfriend's driving.  Are you a Spanish girl?  Yes, I am.  I can tell by her voice.  It's going to wreck the fancy boyfriend in the car.  Yeah.  We like playing with the girls that are all alone at home.  Yeah, at home.  The car is a little awkward, too.  And the cell phones, you can't pick up what truly is in her lap.  Oh, come on.  Paulina, no offense, but we've got to move on.  Okay. 
[01:43:30]  Hold on, hold on.  No, no, no, no.  It's all about...  Sometimes on the car phone, what you think is a baby's butt turns out to be Fidel Castro's face.  Very hard to tell.  Rhiannon.  Yeah?  You're in your car, too, huh?  Yes.  Are you alone?  Yeah.  Put her on hold.  See if we can find a girl.  All right.  Hold on.  Okay.  The best is when they're home alone.  Rebecca.  Yeah?  Where are you?  I'm in my car, too.  But on a backcountry road. 
[01:44:00]  A country road.  A country road.  Back on a country road.  That's good.  Back country road.  Yeah.  Very good.  Sounds nice and quiet.  That's, um...  It does.  All right.  Hold on.  You're definitely a possibility.  All right.  We've got to get the ultimate girl here out of the way we're going on.  Spread out on the kitchen floor.  Yeah.  Elaine, you're at home, right?  Oh, yes, I am.  All right.  Wait, you sound a little butchy, though.  Excuse me?  You sound a little butchy.  I do sound like a man over the phone.  I do.  But I am a woman.  Pool rack stuck with afro. 
[01:44:30]  Bill ain't even waiting for the phone to go below her neck.  All right.  Elaine, no offense.  We're looking for the perfect girl.  She's got to be at home with the sexy voice.  I'm at home laying on a king-size bed.  King-size bed.  But you've got, like, a manly voice, though.  She started trying to change it, though.  Bad.  King-size bed, and my boobs are hanging over each side.  All right.  Hold on, Elaine.  So far, we have Elaine that sounds a little butchy on the king-size bed.  Yeah.  We've got Rebecca on that country road. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, God.  I hope Gina works out.  All right.  Let's go to Gina.  Gina.  Yes.  Where are you?  I'm at home with my friend.  Who's your friend?  My friend's Donna.  Donna.  Oh.  Hey.  Here we go.  And if you're like, we can get on the kitchen floor, if that's your problem.  Oh, you're very naughty.  And Donna's hanging out with you today?  Yes.  Would you like her to say hi?  Sure.  Hold on. 
[01:45:30]  Hello.  Okay.  Virgin.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  I think we've arrived.  And what's your name, little girl?  My name is Donna.  Oh, wait.  What was that?  Oh, Donna and Gina.  I'm sorry.  Donna and Gina.  Yeah.  And you're very close friends?  Yes, we're very close friends.  How close?  Oh, we're very close right now.  Would you like to guess what's in her pants right now?  Your head.  You got that right.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Well, I think everyone else can hang up.  I think we have our contestant. 
[01:46:00]  Okay.  All right.  Where are you guys right now?  We're in my apartment.  Uh-huh.  All alone?  You didn't have to work today?  What's the deal?  Actually, I cut out of work early.  Just so you could be with Gina?  Yeah, because I'm usually in school at this time.  All right.  So she's usually in school as well.  You allowed to eat that on Passover?  We're not very religious.  So you're a vegetarian?  Yeah.  Yes, absolutely a vegetarian.  She's not passing over the batch.  No.  Okay.  But I think I want to switch sides, though. 
[01:46:30]  I think she should be in my pants now.  Well, I think that would be wonderful.  Okay, well...  You're talking on the phone.  How tired could it be again?  Yeah, I just don't know what she was saying there.  Gina, how are you?  Oh, okay.  Are you both completely naked?  Yes.  Very nice.  Are you on a bed, a floor?  The couch.  The couch.  The couch.  Very good, guys.  Hope you're visualizing this.  Gina, what do you look like?  I have black hair.  Okay.  Where?  Oh, I'm...  Okay, never mind. 
[01:47:00]  I'm a naturally brunette person.  I'm not, you know...  Nice body?  Yeah, pretty decent.  Yeah.  She doesn't complain.  She doesn't complain?  Are you lipstick lesbians or kind of the dykey kind?  No, we're lipstick lesbians.  How big's the rack?  I'm a 34D.  34D.  Is she happy with her large boobs?  She's 34B.  She's really, really perky.  Yes.  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Yeah, she is, Dr. Smith.  Woo! 
[01:47:30]  We're going to have to make some phone calls and just play the Dr. Smith clips.  Yeah.  See if anyone will talk to, you know, Dr. Smith on tape.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  34D.  Very nice.  You keep yourself in nice shape and all?  Yes, I do.  All right.  You're on the couch laying down and Donna's busy right now?  Yes, she is.  What does Donna look like?  Donna has a nice shape.  Well, the back of her head looks like.  Yeah, she has very long hair.  She likes when I pull on it.  Oh, yeah?  Right.  I like when I grab it. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  I'm having a problem concentrating right now.  I bet.  Are there any naughty girls there?  Us, too.  No, but my friends, well, actually, it's always four of us.  We seem to like to keep it within the group.  Would you like to spank Donna for us?  Oh.  You want me to spank her?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I would love to.  Yeah.  We just want to make sure she's, you know, naked for this bit here.  Oh, naked? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  She still has her work clothes on.  And you're naked?  Yeah.  So, would you like Donna to spank you?  Have her smack your bare ass.  Donna, how would you like to spank my ass instead of me spanking yours?  Put the phone down there and smack me.  Oh, she wants her spank.  Someone smacks someone's ass.  Put the phone there.  Well, tell Donna to get her damn pants off this.  Okay.  Okay.  Hold on.  Look at that.  Someone's having my goddamn mom. 
[01:49:00]  Did you hear that?  Hey, smack both the bitches.  I'll come over there.  I'll punch them both.  Would you like me to do it again?  Yeah, we didn't hear it.  Oh, okay.  In the uterus.  Hey, wait a minute.  That didn't sound like a smack in the ass.  No?  No.  Put the phone there and smack her.  One more time.  Okay.  Is she using a club?  I know.  What are you using?  My hand.  It doesn't...  It sounds like a...  I work out a little, though.  It's a little bit too firm. 
[01:49:30]  You wanted something to make it and you came to the wrong house.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, it's just kind of like...  She works out more than I do.  I'm a little bit more flabby than she is in the back.  I'm just thinking open-handed on a bare buttocks always sounds like, you know, like a smack.  Yeah.  That sort of sounded like a punch.  Oh, no.  That wasn't a punch.  Well, maybe the position I'm in wasn't right.  We want to hear the cheeks flapping.  They want to hear your cheeks flapping.  Punch her in the face.  A cheek flapping? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  I don't know if you'll be able to hear that over the phone.  Well, just hit her a few times.  Oh.  Oh, I don't want to hit her more than once.  Punch her in the jaw.  In the jaw?  No.  We're not into violence like that.  When the cheeks flap, it sounds like...  All right, let's play What's in My Pants.  Okay.  All right, so we're going to play with Gina, right?  Yes.  Okay.  What we know about Gina, she has 34 deep breasts.  She's a little flabby.  She doesn't work out as much as Donna.  She has long black hair, I believe, right?  Yes.  Okay. 
[01:50:30]  And are you bisexual?  I'm bisexual.  Bisexual.  Girls and women.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Anything else you guys need to know before you make your decisions?  No.  No, I'm talking to the guys.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We're pretty clear.  Does she look anything like Ross from Patty Duke?  No.  Nine-year-old boy with no teeth.  All right, let's start with...  Big glasses.  Joe, are you playing too?  Yeah, I'm...  All right, the other Joe is playing. 
[01:51:00]  All right, Joe, why don't we go to you first, and we'll work our way around the table.  Remember, girls, don't expose what you have in your pants until all of us have voted,  and we ask you to reveal what is indeed in your pants, okay?  Okay.  Oh, okay.  Gina?  I'm talking to her vag right now.  She hasn't moved the box.  Yeah, don't give any hints at what you're...  Not a problem.  Until we ask you.  All right.  I'm a listener.  I understand the rules.  All right, Joe, let's go.  Okay.  Give a rub.  Okay, hold on. 
[01:51:30]  Okay.  That's up and down?  Okay.  I did the up and down.  That was it.  Okay, now do side to side.  Now do circular motion.  That's telling.  Okay.  Okay.  Joe Groen, if you would like to vote.  It almost sounds like a high and tight, like they have in the military.  I don't know what that's in there yet, yeah, but...  A high and tight.  A mighty fine.  A mighty fine. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Like a velour shirt.  Don't be a bonus of what I have.  Yes.  Don't talk.  Don't talk.  I'm going to have to go with the, I guess, what would be the closest to the low-cropped  carpet?  Like a triangle, but well-groomed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we have that one.  Okay.  All right.  Triangle, yeah, well-groomed.  Okay.  Joe?  My brother Joe?  I need to hear the circular motion one more time.  Circular, that's true.  That was telling.  There was something going on there. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  If we could have the circular motion again, please, Gina.  Sure.  All right.  All right.  Joe?  I'm going to have to go with the bare wood floor.  Oh, Joe's saying wood floor.  I'm saying wood floor.  Ballsy move.  Ballsy move.  It just, it sounded like, it sounded like wood to me.  Okay.  Cowbell Bill?  Bill?  I'm going to guess, well, first, I think that the cesspool is a little too close to the 
[01:53:00]  picnic area there.  You can tell that by what you heard?  Well, it didn't sound like taint, no taint.  You can get a very good hint just by asking if her drapes match the carpet, Joe.  I'm going to go with the Hitler.  Oh, Hitler?  Yeah.  Very good.  Okay.  Yeah, thank you.  Quiet and loud and quiet and loud.  Yeah.  Opie?  Oh, I thought I was going to be last. 
[01:53:30]  I'm going to go, oh, man.  Triangle.  Well-groomed triangle.  Triangle, much like Joe Gruen had picked.  I'm going to go, yes, because there was that breaking of a sound and a circular motion.  I'm going to say mohawk because, yeah, I think it was going from skin to brush to skin.  So, yeah, I'll say mohawk.  Are we all voted?  Is that your final answer? 
[01:54:00]  Who wants to guess again?  Joe and I went with, like, the well-groomed triangle.  Joe, Anthony's brother, went wood floor.  Cowbell Bill went Hitler mustache.  Anthony went, I'm saying mohawk.  Mohawk, okay.  Gina, what is in your pants?  The wooden floor.  Yeah!  Joe pulls on out.  See, I am in touch with the female genitalia.  Thank you.  The wood floor.  Wait, we've got to hear that again.  We've got to hear what a wood floor sounds like.  Okay, you ready? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  All right, up, down, circular.  Do the circular.  Okay, you guys like the circular.  It feels better, too.  Hold on.  That's what tricked everyone, I think.  Okay, hold on.  All right, let's go.  Oh, my God.  It's got to have a 533.  Hello?  Hello?  I think.  All right.  Yeah, it might.  It looks like Fred Flintstone's mouth now.  Yeah, you've got to understand.  She was there for a while.  It's, you know.  All right.  You have to remember one thing. 
[01:55:00]  Women that like women do not like potty hair.  Oh.  Yes, exactly.  She hates hat.  Oh.  No.  No.  A true master.  Yes, you guys are 100% correct with that one.  Thank you.  So what was that gap we were hearing?  Chicken cutlet?  That is a hunk of Play-Doh thrown on the barbershop floor.  Well, Gina, thanks for playing What's in My Pants.  Thank you very much.  Big hand for Gina.  Yeah, let's hear it for Gina.  Last time I... 
[01:55:30]  Oh, here we go.  The theme song.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Woo!  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Virgin.  How'd you like the mobile law?  Huh?  Wow.  And there you have it.  I wouldn't have figured the wood floor. 
[01:56:00]  Joe comes through.  Thank you.  That one.  That was very good.  I'll tell you, though, it was really much less from the sound of the phone than it was  from the psychology of the whole thing.  See?  There's a fine balance between what you hear in the pre-interview.  And what you hear during the procedure.  Yeah.  You have to take all things into consideration.  Now, come to think of it, it did sound exactly like yesterday's wooden floor.  Sometimes what sounds like a wooden floor, though, ends up looking like those big wax  lips dropped in the hamster cage.  I swear to God. 
[01:56:30]  You've got to watch that.  All right.  You've got to get it deceiving.  And with that, we've got to take a break.  Before we go to break, though, this is really cool.  We've got a pair of tickets to see the heavyweight championship of the world.  We've got Lennox Lewis and Michael Grant going at it April 29th at the Garden.  A ticket call, 2-1-2-3-0-7-7-1-7-1.  But if you're the tough caller right now, you've got a pair.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:57:00]  You guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take it too far to the point where I literally  get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show.  Go take a mitle.  1-2-7-1-2-3-0-7-1-A-W.  Hey, Anthony, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Yes.  What's coming up?  Easter.  Easter.  Easter Sunday.  I will not be celebrating Easter this year.  I'll be at the Knick game Sunday.  Yeah, I hope he got Knick tickets.  He's going to get in big trouble for not being there for Easter.  But let me tell you, you know how you make up for it? 
[01:57:30]  I'm going to send everyone I know of Vermont Teddy Bear Company and hope they understand  that I need to go see the Knicks in the playoffs before I spend a Sunday with my  family.  Here's what you do.  You call 1-800-829-BEAR, get a friendly bear counselor on the phone, and go,  Hi, this is Opie.  I screwed up.  I'm spending Easter at the Knick game instead of with my family.  And the bear counselor helps you out and says, Opie, get the hair bear.  It's a bunny wearing bunny ears.  Or the flashback bunny dressed like a... 
[01:58:00]  Like a goddamn hippie.  With a tie-dyed t-shirt, peace necklace, and a pair of a...  Bear-ken-stocks.  What?  Bear-ken-stocks.  Bear-ken-stocks.  What the hell's a bear-ken-stocks?  Call the bear counselor and find out for yourself.  Ask them what a bear-ken-stocks is.  Hmm.  It's like a Lederhosen.  Oh, is that what it is?  I don't know.  Why would a hippie thing wear?  Maybe it's like overalls.  They get a little wacky working off the word bear sometimes.  But it's still a great company, and they've got great bears. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  But a bear-ken-stock, I don't know.  I don't know.  How's it spelled?  Bear-ken-stocks.  K-E-N-stocks.  It's some type of clothing.  Okay.  I'm sure we'll get 18,000 instant feedbacks to what it is.  All right.  Sandals.  Oh, sandals?  Joe Groen says it's sandals.  Sandals.  There you go.  Groovy.  We've got a hippie hanging out with us.  No, no.  Not from a hippie.  Okay.  Every Vermont Teddy Bear delivered with a personalized card and candy treat and a colorful gift box with an air hole. 
[01:59:00]  That's air hole.  Send a bear or bunny to your sweetie at their workplace or to the kids at school.  What a great idea.  They don't call it a bear hole?  No.  It's an air hole.  Air hole.  And all of the bosses out there, Secretary's Day, next Wednesday, April 26th, sending a bear gram to the office is going to make you look good.  Look like the best boss on the planet.  Ask about the real boss bear or the voodoo boss bear.  The voodoo boss bear.  Bear Council is ready to help you out right now.  It only takes five minutes to order.  Better than flowers.  Better than just sending candy. 
[01:59:30]  The Vermont Teddy Bear.  Overnight delivery guaranteed.  Call 1-800-829-BEAR or shop online at vermontteddybear.com.  Vermont Teddy Bear.  Give them the number again, Opie.  Please.  1-800-829-BEAR.  1-800-829-BEAR.  Tell them Opie and Anthony sent you, okay?  The Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Train right here.  What's that, a train?  What's that, a train? 
[02:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  And we're back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Hope you're enjoying the festivities today.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people want to hear the Columbine song one more time.  Well, there's a kind of a, I don't know, kind of a news event.  Right?  It's the way we do news here, right?  And they'll be strong.  Okay, terrific.  Yes. 
[02:00:30]  Okay, terrific.  We'll play it one more time.  The boss is out of town, so I think we can get away with it.  Are you sure he's not just having drinks with Spaz somewhere?  That was pretty funny earlier.  But Anthony's brother Joe and Cowbell Bill and your sister Dawn.  Dawn, yes, making her a song parody debut, I believe.  She'll start calling up.  She's going to start calling up now and demanding plugs on airtime.  And I'm sure it'll end with Opie punching her in the eye. 
[02:01:00]  All right, we'll get that song on again before we get out of here.  We'll do it in the near future.  How's that, okay?  Also, Anthony, something we really need to get into again here is Bridget's waxing.  The email on this was just off the hook.  Well, what started off as something I thought was going to be pretty effing lame  because Bridget came in.  She wanted to get bikini waxed.  She is, of course, a virgin.  Yes, Scott, so say it again.  Virgin.  A virgin, Opie.  She's, what, 19 years old.  She's a redhead and a virgin. 
[02:01:30]  And she just has a very innocent look about her.  Even though she wears, like, kind of sexy, slutty clothes, though.  I don't know what that's about.  It was cold out, and she was wearing this flowing little sundress.  Tiny little sundress.  And she came in and wanted to be bikini waxed.  And we kind of talked her into waxing the whole thing off wood floor.  But she wouldn't let us in the room.  Ow.  She made, yeah, well, you should hear it.  We had to cover up the windows.  We had to cover up the glass on the door. 
[02:02:00]  She would not let anyone see her, even semi-naked.  She won't even pull her dress up to show her underwear.  If she's getting bikini waxed, she could wear some provocative bikinis on the beach for everyone to see.  But our pals Opie and Anthony can't see anything.  And we almost got video.  Yeah.  We're not asking for a pelvic.  For the love of God.  We almost got video.  God, was that close.  Where's Mark?  He's going to kill me.  She'd have been that.  Yeah, she's going to be pissed.  But that didn't come out.  Where's Mark? 
[02:02:30]  Oh, the sounds of Bridget having her crying.  So it's going to be Bridget crying again if she finds out what happened.  Should we tell everyone what we were up to?  Is that the same Bridget crying?  Yeah.  Let's make Bridget cry.  You might remember we introduced Bridget to the show.  She called up, said she gave her boyfriend a hummer for the first time.  And right after her boyfriend was done, her boyfriend pushed her in the far head,  knocked her to the floor and said, I always knew you were a little slut.  Virgin, first time giving a hummer.  He totally wrecked her for every other guy out there.  Yeah, but she held up for a long time until Opie's brother called. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, Opie's brother called up and got Bridget to cry.  Yeah.  So now she's been coming on, getting more and more prudish with every appearance on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  So she comes in to get bikini waxed and doesn't let anybody see.  So, you know, if she would have let us sneak a peek, we probably wouldn't have done this.  Psycho Mark is a friggin' lunatic.  He grabs the camcorder, shoves it in the cabinet in the room that she's going into.  That's all taped off.  Aims it up, turns it on, lets it run.  She gets in there. 
[02:03:30]  You see her, she's in her robe.  She's just ready to take the robe off and get naked for the camera.  We can't move this on the air when we're nuts.  One of the waxing ladies backs into the cabinet and it shuts.  So, I mean, I'm talking right when she grabs the robe to take it off, all you see is the inside of a cabinet.  And it was perfect, too.  The camera was set up.  The camera was set up perfect.  We were going to send it in to peepingtom.com.  She can't do anything.  I mean, there is no tape. 
[02:04:00]  There is no tape.  For all she knows, we could be making this story up and that we've been checking out the tape every night.  David, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Great.  I was listening to this show on the radio at my desk, you know?  Yeah.  And it was really hot.  I mean, when she was doing that stuff and every time they'd do the big pull on her and she'd give out that little squeal and everything like that.  Yeah.  You know, after like five to ten minutes or something, I'm sporting some serious wood  and I couldn't get up from my desk and get to my meeting.  I was 15 minutes late because of it. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  I thought it was going to be lame.  And it turned out to be hot because she was squeaking like that.  Like every time she'd go, okay, they put the wax on.  Okay, they're putting a strip on.  And then there'd be a little delay and you'd go, and she'd like moan.  It was huge.  I was like brain dead at my meeting, too.  Thanks a lot, guys.  I appreciate it.  Where is the wax?  Oh, we have it.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to say.  We saved the wax with her red pubes.  We're going to stick it on eBay with the RotGut CDs.  Yeah, get John to get the wax.  We still have it.  Yeah.  Get interned John to grab it. 
[02:05:00]  After yesterday when they painted the office, it's hidden under something.  We've got to find it.  Oh, really?  As long as it's not the baseboard heater.  Sniff it out.  As long as it's not the baseboard heater.  Who dropped the trout?  All right, so I guess we're going to replay some of the audio from the other day.  Yeah, you've got to hear this.  It's real hot.  She's a virgin.  She's young.  She's insane.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Cute little sundress getting completely nude in the other room with a couple of waxers. 
[02:05:30]  Okay, terrific.  There's something very erotic about it.  Yeah.  And since Bridget came in, we've got a ton of email from girls that are more than willing  to get their bikini waxed right in front of us, Anthony.  Oh, there's some of them that are saying they want us to use our teeth to pull the wax off.  I mean, it's getting unbelievable.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Yeah.  Wax on.  Wax on.  Yeah.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yeah, indeed.  I want to wax it till it's as smooth as William's ass. 
[02:06:00]  Woo!  Yeah, Judy used to wax.  Yes.  Major West liked it smooth as a baby's behind.  Woo!  All right.  Does she look kind of like Rebecca De Mornay?  That's what I'm picturing.  I don't know.  Who, um...  Yeah, kind of.  Because she has kind of an icy blue eye thing going, but she has red hair.  Nah, you know what?  Obviously, this doesn't make sense to anybody, but Rex's wife. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, Megan?  Yeah.  Okay.  Very Irish.  Does she have the strawberry tongue?  What is this?  Okay, Bill.  What is the strawberry tongue?  Hold on.  Some redhead's got that strawberry tongue, you know, with the little, you know, nubs on there.  You ever saw that?  Redhead's strawberry tongue with little nubs.  Yeah.  What?  Like little red nuggets.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, explain yourself, Bill.  Well, for some redheads, it depends on how red the hair is.  But the redder, the more pronounced the... 
[02:07:00]  We're not talking Bozo's head and a leg lock here.  Oh, jeez.  Just one second.  Well, you'll see now.  In the future, just look.  Now I'm gonna.  Yeah.  It looks like a strawberry.  The tongue.  Let's talk about some of Bill's idiosyncrasies.  When it comes to women.  When it comes to women.  He had one of the hottest girls in high school begging for him.  Absolutely begging for him in his apartment.  And why did he turn her down? 
[02:07:30]  This is why.  She was naked as a jaybird in bed with him.  He told me this whole story.  She got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  That wasn't the reason.  In the middle of the night, she got up to go to the bathroom.  She got up for a quick douche to go to the bathroom.  And he saw freckles behind her knees.  Really?  Full of freckles.  Now this girl, you have to. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, brother.  I can't do nothing with that.  Freckles behind her knees.  She had freckles.  Yeah.  Not heavy freckles, but that was it.  As soon as he saw that she had freckles behind her knees.  Da.  She got freckles behind her knees, brother.  She's no good.  Look at this girl.  This girl.  And she had a twin sister, too.  And she was hot.  Absolutely stunning.  So what's the problem with freckles?  I don't know, man.  It's just, you know.  Once I get something in my head, that's it. 
[02:08:30]  You know, and, you know, she was doing...  Thank God it's not brain.  Thanks a lot, man.  Come on.  He's had a couple of them like that, though.  Her teeth weren't right.  What do you mean?  This one was, you know, doing what she was doing down there.  And she looked up at me and I just, I was like, oh my God, Danny Partridge.  Is that what you thought, Danny Partridge? 
[02:09:00]  Once I get a thought like that, I'd say it's over.  How do you think this crap up, man?  He's come up to me...  He's come up to me at times and gone, I got to break up with a brother.  Bill, she's gorgeous.  I got to break up with a brother.  Why?  One eye tooth is a half a centimeter longer than the other.  You do have some idiosyncrasies when it comes to check.  I guess so.  The freckles behind the knee.  Like, maybe freckles on the boob, you would think something.  Or somewhere.  I wouldn't even go that far.  Behind the knee. 
[02:09:30]  It's just...  Wow.  I used to like an occasional spray of freckles on my women.  On your girls.  When they're eight.  Yeah.  Hey, we're getting a request for Cowbell Bill bits.  Oh, yeah.  Jeff from New York writes, tell Cowbell Bill to do that cranky-ass bit.  Well, he hasn't done the cranky-ass bit.  You know what?  That's weird.  It's me doing an invitation of Bill doing the cranky-ass bit.  And for Bill to actually do the cranky-ass bit, he's got to be working in a hot attic  for about four and a half hours. 
[02:10:00]  And I'll take a dump real bad.  That's good, man.  Homey, homey, homey.  So what's the...  I will go home.  He'll go home and shower, man.  Yeah, you can't walk around cranky.  Nothing worse than someone walking by and smelling like ass.  Right.  I mean, for the love of God.  And there's no telling.  You can't tell me you don't know you smell like ass.  Right.  Well, Ed, take a shower.  I just can't understand how Joe can go into the bathroom on the golf course at 6.30 in  the morning, blow a loaf, and then go walk 18 holes. 
[02:10:30]  It's very easy.  Just drink a cup of coffee first.  Yeah, that's the truth.  You can't.  You barely, like, walk from the bathroom to the living room.  That's it, man.  And not work up cranky-ass.  Well, Ed, if Bill's not going to do it, we found the tape of you imitating Bill talking  about cranky-ass.  It's really quick.  It's like 40 seconds.  As Cowbell Bill says, if you pop the nugget and then go for a long walk, you get cranky-ass.  You know, it's like you had to really force out that last milk-dud. 
[02:11:00]  And then you take a long walk, you're going to get cranky-ass.  Sometimes you don't know that little milk-dud is still dangling.  And you get up.  Anything over about a quarter mile, and you got cranky-ass.  You don't want cranky-ass.  You got to make sure you clean up.  Get every little nugget out.  How about Bill? 
[02:11:30]  I'm working on it, brother.  It's like a cross between Bill and Frank Bush.  Yeah.  I don't care how many times you wipe, there's still something on the outside of your body.  I don't care.  You got to get those little moist towelettes.  I know all about it.  Carry them in your tux.  Those are hemorrhoids.  Bill, you got some problems, man.  The commercial for tux was appropriate.  They would put out the lit match with it.  I don't know anybody, I don't know any guy, come on, you got to fess up to it,  that hasn't moistened the tissue when they're done to get the full relief. 
[02:12:00]  That's it, man.  Come on, ice cream.  Come on, ice cream.  Lisa, what's going on?  Nothing much.  All right, you're interrupting a fine discussion here.  This must be good.  What do you have for us today?  Well, my boyfriend's on his way home, and I know he had a very hard day at work,  so I wanted to do something special for him over the radio.  And what's that?  Probably spank my hand. 
[02:12:30]  Okay, terrific.  Can I say that word?  What, ass?  Yeah, I think.  But he would like that, too.  Sorry, I got away from this.  And you bastard, you beat me by this much.  Sometimes we do the show just for ourselves, don't we?  And explain to Lisa a word we can't say on the radio.  Yes, thank you, Opie, for dumping me.  Just to share so everyone else is in on it.  Okay, so Lisa, are you naked at home?  Where are you? 
[02:13:00]  Yes, I am.  All right, a lot of nudity today on our show.  Yes, but none we're seeing.  No, unfortunately.  This blows.  Are you a hot lady there, Lisa?  Yeah, I think I am.  All right, you got a nice shapely ass?  Yes, I do.  And you want to spank it?  Yes, I do.  And your husband is driving home?  Boyfriend.  Boyfriend, sorry.  Yes.  Okay.  What's his name?  His name begins with a B.  Who cares? 
[02:13:30]  All right, so what do you have on right now?  Absolutely nothing.  That always rocks.  That's good.  All right, why don't you, I assume you know how to spank yourself, so why don't you start  whenever you're ready there, Lisa.  Okay, ready?  Sure.  Okay.  Okay.  There you go. 
[02:14:00]  That was with the belt.  His.  Why is that going to turn him on?  You're not moaning or anything?  You could have been clapping your hands.  Yeah.  I'm getting him into the mindset when he gets home.  All right.  Well, you guys have some fine sex there.  Oh, we will.  All right.  Okay, thanks.  Bye.  If she had cranky ass, it would look like he was slapping a bowl full of chocolate puddings.  Tom, what's going on? 
[02:14:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I got a cranky ass story.  Uh-oh.  It's my own story, though.  Okay.  Shut up.  Cranky ass.  My own story on the Lifetime Network.  Every time I go to a bar, it seems I have cranky ass.  You got to tell it like Bill.  I can't tell you.  Every time I go to the bar, I have cranky ass.  That's better.  That's better than Bill in prison.  I get ready to go out.  I'm getting at the bar, then all of a sudden my ass starts acting off, and I don't know  what's wrong with it.  So I got to go to the bathroom five or six times just to wipe my cranky ass, and it's never 
[02:15:00]  satisfied.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, man.  Now I got a turn for cranky ass.  I never knew what it was.  I felt like I was the only person in the world who had it.  No, no, man.  That's it.  Yeah.  Everybody's had it?  I think all guys at one time or another have had cranky butt.  Cranky ass.  It's the most annoying feeling in the world.  You just go home and take a shower.  You start, you know, you get maybe in a confined area.  You start spinning around like a dog chasing his tail trying to find out where it's coming 
[02:15:30]  from.  What the hell?  Trying to give it a little good scratch.  What the hell is that?  What the?  What the hell is that?  You're on the living room carpet doing the poodle shuffle.  Legs akimbo dragging yourself with your front legs.  Like a chihuahua.  All right, guys.  Thanks, Matt.  You need a bidet powered by Briggs and Stratton.  Goddamn cowbell bill, man.  I wonder how many people are going to come up to you Saturday night at Sergeant Peppers 
[02:16:00]  in East North Park and say, hey, Bill, you got cranky butt yet?  You've been sitting on that drum throne for three hours now.  Yeah, of course, cowbell bill, a drummer for the band.  Yes.  We're going to be down.  Joe Gruen showing up or what?  Mr. Potato Head.  Perhaps you haven't noticed the L on my forehead for Loser.  I'm home with wife and son.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Times, they are a changing.  All right.  Let's get the band back together, man. 
[02:16:30]  Well, and a lot of people want to talk about cranky ass, but let's.  Well, what a great subject.  All right.  We'll be back.  And if you're on hold, stay there.  We'll get to you next.  Some days, you know, for a last ride.  And other days, we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting.  It's true.  O.P.  And Anthony.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yes.  Cowbell Bill wants to help us out with this live read today, I believe.  I think he knows a few people who might need Stacker 2. 
[02:17:00]  What are the type of people that might need him?  Well, for instance, you know, those old corduroys making a little too much noise.  Building up some heat.  Or maybe they're not making any noise at all.  They're grinding down and look like C-covered to a 65 Rambler.  And I tell you, people that are overweight get the worst cranky ass ever.  Yeah.  Probably.  For some reason, you know, you can't get back there.  You can't bathe.  Out of reach. 
[02:17:30]  If you can't bathe, if you can't get rid of your cranky ass, even if you know you have  it, because your arms don't reach around, if you look like a T-Rex trying to touch his  ass, we all know that's impossible, it's time for Stacker 2.  World's strongest fat burner.  Thousands have lost weight off of it.  What does it do?  It's the world's strongest fat burner.  It cuts down on those cravings to snack during the day.  And it gives you a boost energy.  Boost of energy to get you through the day.  And you feel it's a fact 45 minutes after taking it, or your money back. 
[02:18:00]  Opie took one the other day.  I swear to God, it looked like the cartoons.  You ever see that when the dog would scare the cat and he'd fly up and cling to the ceiling?  That was Opie.  I was like, where's Opie?  And I look up and he's stuck to the ceiling.  It was amazing.  Well, it had to balance out the Valium from the night before.  That's a joke, of course.  Of course it is.  No, it isn't.  Okay.  It was Stacker 2.  That's right.  No reason to carry those nuggets around bigger than walnuts. 
[02:18:30]  Take your Stacker 2.  Yeah, Stacker 2.  Burns the fat, crushes the cravings in between meals, and it gives you a boost of energy.  Crush the cravings instead of your lover.  Stacker 2.  Give them a call.  1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stacker 2.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Booty-dooty.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Open the end of the day. 
[02:19:00]  107-WNEW.  Ah, we're back.  We have Anthony's crew hanging out with us today.  Oh, yeah.  Whole studio full of fun.  Cowbell Bill.  My brother Joe.  And Joe Gruen.  Joe Gruen.  Friend from the past.  I haven't seen him in years.  Yeah.  Yeah, Joe.  You can say something.  I came here for the money Anthony owes me.  I'm going to rock your name.  We'll take it.  All right.  We have a ton of cranky ass stories, 
[02:19:30]  and we also have a girl that's being waxed as we speak.  Let's go to the cranky ass stories.  Yeah, sure.  Well, if the idiot would put Kelly on hold,  we could talk to her on the air.  Ah, who's screening?  We have people that work for the show  that spend half their time trying to pick up women  instead of screening the calls.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's put Kelly on hold, please.  Uh, Kelly.  Kelly.  Kelly.  Hello?  Don't listen to your radio.  Hello? 
[02:20:00]  I can't hear anything.  I can't hear anything, you stupid bitch.  Did you hear that?  She's listening to the radio,  and we're in 40-second delay.  So watch.  In a couple of seconds, she's going to go,  Oh, hi.  Kelly.  Smelly.  Smelly Kelly.  Smelly.  Oh, there he is.  What an idiot.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Good.  Pretty good.  Sitting there listening to the radio, were you? 
[02:20:30]  She's still listening to the radio.  Kelly.  Kelly.  You stupid bitch.  You dumb plot.  Could you turn your radio down?  Turn the radio down, guys.  Okay, it's down.  All right.  Now listen to your phone.  It's a phone call.  Yes, I know.  No, obviously you don't.  Okay, now what do you want to do for our program?  What do I want to do in your program?  Well, right now I'm in a van with 10 very horny guys. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  And I'm the only girl right now, and we are heading down to Maryland.  You're heading down to Maryland?  Yes.  And what are you going to do down there?  F.  Well, you know, we should have a little fun out on some boats, sail around, maybe get  naked out there.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  Virgin.  Virgin.  You're a joke. 
[02:21:30]  She's been plugged more than Jay Moore does for a rasseter.  I'm just kidding.  Pam, Pam.  Kelly.  Yes.  So what do you want?  What are you going to do?  We're in the middle of the number one radio show in New York.  What are you doing?  You're going to get put on the rotisserie?  Well, the guys, they have some duct tape out right now.  Yeah.  All right.  And they're cute.  They're cute.  They're cute.  They're cute.  They're cute.  They're cute.  They're cute.  And we just heard a little bit you did about bikini waxing.  Yeah.  So we decided that they could be bikini waxing with a duct tape. 
[02:22:00]  Well, that's good.  And then how handy.  After that, they could do your mouth and your feet and hit you over there with a spade shovel  and leave you in a shallow grave.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That's what we're planning.  Oh, you're very naughty.  All right.  So, Kelly, do you have your pants down?  Yes.  Ready to go.  Almost.  I've got to take the underwear off first.  All right.  Take the underwear off. 
[02:22:30]  That was nice.  I have nice black lacy underwear on right now.  I bet.  She's like the retarded girl that all, you know, the sports teams take it off.  I'll take it off.  You get the feeling you need a spatula to do that.  Are you naked, Kelly?  Yes, I am.  Looks like she's got the underwear in the pancake batter.  I must say, we're getting some looks from people that are driving by.  Yeah.  I bet.  What color van do you have?  Green.  Green van. 
[02:23:00]  What road are you on?  What road are you on?  We just got off the Verrazano Bridge.  Okay.  I don't think there's any of our listeners in that area.  No.  So, don't worry about that.  Got off the Verrazano.  Getting on the Hershey Highway, are you?  All right.  So, let's apply the duct tape.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Let's hear this.  Who wants to pull out the duct tape?  That would be me.  All right.  Sean.  All right.  Let's talk to Sean.  Someone with a brain would be nice.  Okay.  You want to talk to Sean?  Yeah.  Here he is.  Good luck.  I hope they wax out your fucking eyebrows.  Sean, is she naked? 
[02:23:30]  Hell yeah.  All right.  What kind of patch does she have?  What kind of patch does she have?  Yeah.  Nice, smooth triangle.  Okay.  Why don't you apply the duct tape?  This is going to hurt like a mother.  Apply the duct tape.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  How much pot have you guys smoked?  All right.  Never mind.  Okay.  Terrific.  Stupid.  Sean.  Yeah.  Okay.  You have the duct tape in your hand?  Yes, I do.  You have a naked girl in front of you? 
[02:24:00]  Yes, I do.  Peel the duct tape off and stick it to her thatch.  To her back.  No, her thatch.  Holy smoke.  The guy next to us is listening.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey, if we have a listener in the vicinity of the Verrazano Bridge, could you run a green  van off the road for us?  The guy next to you that's listening, is by any chance this guy banging her armpit?  I can't hear both.  Here. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Look, look, look.  Dude, dude.  First, don't curse.  Okay.  Sorry about that.  Secondly, don't listen to the radio.  Listen to the phone.  Thirdly, peel off some duct tape.  I got it.  Stick it on her private area and pull some hair out.  All right.  Ready?  And put the phone near her mouth when you do it, not yours.  Ready?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[02:25:00]  Get that off me.  Get that off me.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  This went horribly wrong.  That sucked.  You want to talk to Kelly?  No, but I put her on the phone.  It's Kelly's mouth.  We should have went to the cranky-ass doors.  Hi, Kelly.  Hi.  How did that feel?  It stung a little.  Yeah.  Okay, bye.  I'm sure there's plenty of high-protein lotion that'll be rubbed into the wound in a couple 
[02:25:30]  of minutes.  Well, you know, I do have lotion.  I can have one of the other guys put that on.  Yeah, I'm sure they all will.  Oil of a lay.  So how many of those guys are you going to allow to bang you?  Well, I don't know.  We're going to get in the jacuzzi tonight at the place we're staying, and we'll see where  things go from there.  After you're done with all of them, you'll be the drain.  All of a sudden, she'll jump in.  It's like, oh, it's empty.  What happened?  All right, Kelly.  This was great. 
[02:26:00]  Very good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good luck, Smelly.  Have fun in Maryland.  There she goes.  There they go.  Kelly in the green van.  All right.  Well, we've got to play the, oh, wow, the Patty Duke song again.  I'll just call it that.  And props out to Sister Dawn.  Of course.  Sister Dawn, who did all of the female vocal.  Finally making her debut on song parodies.  And she's going to be doing a lot more of them, because I was short a female vocalist, 
[02:26:30]  and I've had so many other ideas that I just couldn't execute, because I didn't have a  girl singer.  Oh, you're an artist, Joe.  So now, Dawn, I'm done.  Yes, I am.  Thanks, Tony.  All right.  So what's the setup on this?  We have a whole brand new audience listening here.  Well, it's a very offensive song.  Yeah.  A lot of people didn't like this the first time we played it.  It's a song about Columbine, done to the Patty Duke show theme song. 
[02:27:00]  Correct.  But it doesn't glorify the killers.  It doesn't.  It kind of just documents what happened a year ago today in a goofy song.  It would be the theme that they could use if they made a sitcom out of it.  Yeah, and of course that's going to happen.  Yeah, not saying it should be done.  Although they did make Hogan's Heroes, which was a sitcom about a Nazi pill.  That's true.  So you never know what's going to happen.  Those funny Nazis.  Wow.  So Ilyan Gonzalez as Eric Harris.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:27:30]  No, I think he's going to play the next Anakin Skywalker.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would make sense.  The Spanish version of Star Wars.  All right.  Well, here's the song everyone's talking about.  Okay.  All right.  Anthony's brother Joe, Cowbell Bill, and Aunt's sister Dawn.  Right.  Here it is.  Peter Stiller, who liked an M-16 with high-capacity magazines.  But Eric liked to build the bombs and race it all in little time.  What a crazy pair.  They were killers.  They were killers. 
[02:28:00]  Yes, iconic villains all the way.  Shout out their school in Trenchcoats.  One year ago today.  While Dylan picked out a jock, a stick, an effing Jew, some religious chick.  Well, Eric goes out of control, a shot, an effing Jew.  And a couple of pricks.  They were killers.  Yes, iconic villains.  And you'll find. 
[02:28:30]  They left the light.  They walked the light.  They must have been held up too tight.  They took their own lives.  They were killers.  Who's that Columbine?  Oh, my God.  Someone had commented earlier.  I like the post-production.  Yes, someone commented earlier on instant feedback.  It wasn't offensive enough because I didn't add in gunshots.  So, there you go.  There you go.  Ponderous.  Effing ponderous.  Thank you, Dawn.  Is Dawn on the phone? 
[02:29:00]  Rob from White Plains changing the subject real quickly here, Anthony.  Thank you.  That T-Rex stanky-ass comment was effing hysterical.  Come on.  I almost pissed my pants.  I bet stacker two advertisers never intended that to be in their commercial.  You guys roll.  All right.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  I'm just f***ing around. 
[02:29:30]  Here we go.  O.P.  Anthony.  Our genius gets lost in the crap.  I'm going to cut the crap on this end.  I can tell you that.  1027 WNEW.  All right, Anthony.  We're in the middle of our commercials.  But Scooter from the Bronx writes...  Scooter.  Scooter.  Scooter.  Scooter.  All right.  You shitty people.  with your concrete and your shoes.  Scooter. 
[02:30:00]  Uh, Scooter from the Bronx writes...  Do you think it's gay to talk to other people that are crapping when you're on the can in  a men's bathroom?  Yes.  Hey!  Hey!  I don't know.  I was in the army, man.  We never used to really care who you were talking to.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Of course that's gay.  Yeah.  You can't do that.  Well, the army's one.  That's a whole other thing.  Yeah, it happens.  It happens.  Oh, you're talking about in regular civilian life?  In regular life, you're in the can and a guy next day starts talking. 
[02:30:30]  I don't care what he's talking about.  It just doesn't happen.  Yeah, but no.  Sometimes...  It doesn't happen.  It doesn't happen.  And we'll all three go in there and, like, bomb the bathroom at once.  Oh, God.  For real.  We'll bomb the bathroom at once and it'll turn into a competition almost.  It'll be like, hey, listen to this.  We do that, Don.  It's just a fact of life, you know?  You're gay.  I don't use public bathrooms.  Yeah.  That's another one of Bill's idiosyncrasies. 
[02:31:00]  Some of those public bathrooms are just brutal.  So, Bill, what do you do if you're in Manhattan, you live out on the island, and you have to go?  I don't have to.  Really?  Cup of coffee in the morning, blow a loaf, and I'm on my way.  Clean as a whistle.  Sometimes you open those stalls, and it looks like a damn crime scene.  Oh, my goodness.  Put up the police tent.  What was the guy thinking before you?  Who shot the salad shooter onto the back wall? 
[02:31:30]  What is that, black lettuce?  God.  Looks like a Picasso painting on the back of the ball.  I don't know if you remember this, but one time we were babysitters over at the house,  over at the apartment.  We were being babysat.  It was when we were really young.  Oh, I thought you meant like last week.  No, man.  The toilet bowl got clogged.  Yeah.  Do you remember that?  No.  Well, I guess I put it right out of my mind. 
[02:32:00]  It looked like a frigging fist.  It was done by...  It looked like a fist.  It was one of the babysitters?  It was one of the babysitters' boyfriends, I think.  Oh, great.  They used to have it CI.  They used to have all their boyfriends come over.  I don't remember that, Joe.  Thank God.  Thanks for bringing it up, though.  Very therapeutic.  It's going to take therapy to cure them with that one.  All right, Anthony.  MindSpring Internet Services.  Yes, they teamed up with Earthlink.  Join forces.

[02:33:30]  Is this the best radio you guys could come up with?  1027-WNEW.  Some days, yeah.  Opie, John from Nutley, New Jersey checking in.  I just listened to Joe's Homo No. 1 on the website.  Yes.  It's hilarious.  It sucks you can't play it on the radio, especially when he has all the sound effects going.  It's very funny.  Great listening.  I listened to Opie when he was out on Long Island.  Ah, you guys rule.  Woo, woo, woo. 
[02:34:00]  Maybe you brought him up.  Look at the face Opie makes when you do that.  That wasn't me, Opie.  Look at the face Opie makes when you do that.  Come on, Opie.  It was a growing experience.  That's where we nicknamed Cowbell Bill, matter of fact.  Yes, he was in the studio that day.  Wow, we all go back, don't we?  Jesus Christ.  Maybe you brought this guy lunch at the Hop Bog Industrial Park.  All right.  Homo No. 1 is on the Sound Clips section of the foundrymusic.com website.  Right.  The unofficial Opie and Anthony website. 
[02:34:30]  Go to Sound Clips 1, I believe.  Yeah.  A lot of Joe stuff that can't be played on the air is there for your entertainment, okay?  Yep.  All right, let's go to Jerry, who's very pissed off about the Columbine song.  Jerry, what's going on?  I'm very pissed off.  Climber.  Hello?  Hi, Jerry.  What's up?  What is that crap you were playing, man?  Very, very offensive.  Yeah, well, we know that.  We understand that.  I mean, come on.  I'm a religious person.  I go to church every Sunday, and I'm listening to this on the radio, and it's driving me crazy, man. 
[02:35:00]  You're lying.  I swear to God.  I can tell by the tone of your voice.  You don't care.  No, I care.  This is some kind of thing.  Okay, now, after we went, okay, let's make believe it's going well, and we go, okay, sir,  and we argue about it, and then what do you do?  What do you pop out at the end of the call as a big joke?  Go ahead.  What do I pop out at the end of the...  Yeah.  What's your, like, the joke that you planned?  Go ahead.  Oh, there's no joke here, man.  This is very, very offensive.  Uh-huh.  That guy sounded so phony. 
[02:35:30]  He just cut off.  He sounded so fake.  John, what's going on?  Hello?  Hi, John.  Yes.  This is Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  Oh, boy, I have a story about cranky ass.  You want to hear it?  Very important subject today.  Cranky ass.  Okay, it was New Year's, New Year's Eve.  We're going out that night, and me and I go out and buy a nice pair of shoes and slacks.  We go out to a local bar in Smithtown on Long Island.  Actually, it was Wall Street two years ago, and I had Taco Bell, and my gut was killing  me all night long. 
[02:36:00]  Perculating.  Oh, perculating.  I felt like...  There's Jack in the box.  You know what it is?  It...  It...  It felt like lava in my gut.  Lava.  I hate that.  I know that feeling.  All of a sudden, you just can't function.  Yeah.  It's all that you're thinking about.  Yeah.  You start sweating.  Yeah, you're sweating.  You're like...  Your legs are wobbling.  It affects your entire body.  Oh, we don't want rolling in.  You're just thinking of the ball with that.  All right, John, go ahead.  And I'm dropping mad, foul, stanky smell out of my butt all night long. 
[02:36:30]  I'm with my girlfriend, my friends.  I'm with a group of people.  I'm clearing out the place at the bar.  So, I go into the bathroom, right, to take a leak.  That's how that gets on the back of the ball.  Now you know.  So, I'm aching a leak, and I feel it brewing.  Yes.  So, I decide to try to sneak one out. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  That's a bad move.  It's hit or miss, isn't it?  Let me tell you something.  I felt the hot warmth.  You can't say it.  You can't say it.  Hold on, dude.  That's a little too descriptive.  All right.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Let's just say you decided to go for it, and it looked like the Mississippi River was overflowing.  Yeah, you felt its effect.  Just say, don't even get into any real detail.  Okay.  I looked on the floor, and I made a mess.  Oh, my God.  It was unbelievable. 
[02:37:30]  I was burning.  I was burning.  Isn't it ironic that Anthony had to hit the dump button?  Yeah, that's why they call it that, too.  Okay.  All right.  And then you had cranky ass for the rest of the night?  Well, no.  I cranky.  More than that.  How did you get out of the club?  Well, what I did was...  That's extremely pissed off ass.  I was walking out of the club like I'd been on a horse for like five hours.  I'm walking out of this club.  Bareback.  No underwear. 
[02:38:00]  No, I left.  I was so nervous.  I left everything on.  I just ran out.  I just walked out of the club so fast.  I grabbed my cell phone to call my brother, because he was home that night, and I'd call  him up to come and get me, because I had a mess everywhere.  Everywhere.  When you got to call family members for a dump, it was a bad one.  Did it look like you rode your bike through a mud puddle?  Worse than that.  Worse than that.  Worse.  It was unbelievable.  You'd ride your Schwinn, and it wouldn't have a rear fender, and you'd have the white 
[02:38:30]  t-shirt through the mud puddle.  It would end up on the top of your head somehow.  A big line down your back.  I had to leave all my friends there that night.  All right, John.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  You guys rule.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  I think we have some audio of him that night.  I think we have some audio of him.  Bye-bye.  I think we have some audio of him that night. 
[02:39:00]  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  courtesy of John  the other talk show  is talking about  Elion Gonzalez  we're talking about  cranky ass  it always happens  when you get a room  full of guys  and your sister's  on the line  ah she'll fix this  hi Dawny
