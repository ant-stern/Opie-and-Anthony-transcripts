<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton (and later, Heather Graham and the recurring character "Boardroom Jimmy"), began with jovial banter and a self-deprecating introduction, including the nickname "Sex Vagel" for one of the hosts.  The impending Sirius/XM merger dominated much of the broadcast, with the hosts speculating about its impact on their jobs, broadcast times, and the industry as a whole.  Their apprehension was fueled by past experiences with a Sirius executive who had previously fired them.  The show's sixth-place ranking on the Talkers Magazine Heavy Hundred list was also discussed, leading to humorous (and often insulting) comparisons with other radio personalities like Don Imus and Howard Stern.

A large portion of the show revisited the previous day's broadcast, featuring graphic audio of a female listener being spanked – or, as the hosts described it, punched – by a staff member named Eric. The hosts played the audio repeatedly, using terms like "skin tsunami" and "blubber tsunami" to describe the resulting injury.  Listener calls followed, with varied reactions to the incident.  This segment transitioned into a discussion of a planned spanking demonstration by Jimmy Norton for a guest, intended to showcase proper technique compared to Eric's and a previous spanking incident involving a guest named Corinne, who called in later to describe the resulting bruising and bleeding.  The detailed descriptions of the spankings, including sounds resembling "hitting raw meat," were a recurring topic.

Tyra Banks' Black History Month segment, focusing solely on her own Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue appearance, was heavily criticized.  The hosts played clips, mocking her self-congratulatory tone and comparing her actions unfavorably to other Black women.  This led to a detailed analysis of before-and-after photos, speculation about photo editing, and comparisons to Beyoncé's appearance in the same magazine.  Britney Spears' erratic behavior and Anna Nicole Smith's embalming were also briefly discussed, alongside listener calls and anecdotes, including one about a man with dollar bill rings and another about a girlfriend's bad breath.  The hosts also mentioned a recurring pregnant guest they had previously attempted to have give birth live on air.

Another recurring element was the discussion of Howard Stern’s daughter’s engagement and a planned “creepy” double wedding, coupled with crude jokes from Opie.  The Sirius/XM merger press conference call was a major focus, with the hosts and Boardroom Jimmy providing sarcastic and highly offensive commentary.  Boardroom Jimmy offered outlandish stock market advice and engaged in extended, absurd conversations about the merger's financial implications, using technical jargon and offensive language,  peppered with insults, sexually suggestive remarks, and references to pedophilia, racial stereotypes, and other taboo subjects.  Other recurring characters like “Walt Baums,” “Neil Bortz,” and “King Collin” were referenced.  News reports about the merger were played and mocked, including a sexually explicit bit involving a newscaster and his wife.

The show featured an interview with Heather Graham, covering her career, including humorous anecdotes about auditions (including one for Spider-Man), nude scenes, her role in *Grey Matters* (mentioning a make-out scene with Bridget Moynihan), and her current relationship.  Jimmy Norton contributed personal stories involving his dating life, Viagra, and a threesome with Ron Jeremy.  The interview seamlessly integrated back into the Sirius/XM merger discussion, with the hosts reacting to news reports about their employment status and using profane language to express their reactions.  The show concluded with promotion of *Grey Matters*, continued discussion of the merger news, the announcement of the "Line of the Day" contest, and a sponsor mention.  Throughout the broadcast, the overall tone was irreverent, chaotic, and frequently offensive.

[00:02:30]  as well  in a black hole somewhere  a negro  she's waiting to see if scientists  could figure out how to get talent  out of a black hole  they haven't been too successful yet  have they  good morning  welcome to the Opie and Anthony show  the ONA virus spreading across America  our phone number  1-866-313-FREE  that's 1-866-313-FREE  of course we're  kind of referring to  a little  a little merger  that went down yesterday  what happened 
[00:03:00]  the kind of  I guess it  it affects us  right  I'll tell you this much  I'll tell you right off the bat  this will mean changes  for the Opie and Anthony show  what are those changes  we don't know yet  we have no idea  and I were  talking about  possibilities in the office  well this could happen  or then  if this happens  then maybe this will happen  there's too many variables  right now  everything from  we completely have  nowhere to broadcast  yeah  where I get to go 
[00:03:30]  full time on my podcast  or  or we do broadcast  for  for  for maybe just the  CBS radio stations  or maybe we just go back  to satellite radio  full time  or maybe we go back  to satellite radio  but now we're back  in afternoon drive  the possibilities  are endless  including  having nowhere to broadcast  and  another possibility  none of this  happens at all  yeah  there  so  just speculate away  people 
[00:04:00]  well just  oh was I reading  I wanted to comment  a couple of times  I had you know  whack bag and stuff  and I'm reading  and wanted to comment  but then I was just like  I type two things  and go  why am I bothering  this is just gonna get  eaten up in a  50 page thread  of continued speculation  well they're speculating  like crazy  but to bring everyone  on board  for the newbies  you know  if you're listening  to us on a commercial  radio station  we also  we're also on  XM satellite radio  yes  and after we do  about three hours  on regular radio 
[00:04:30]  our show continues  for the XM audience  yeah  for an additional  two hours  that's right  and  of potty talk  and our company  is attempting  to merge  with our  with our competition  yes  the competition  that we kick their  we kick their ass  so bad  it's not even funny  oh they'll spin it  another way over there  but we kick their ass  in the end  we kicked Sirius's ass  it's just  financially viable  for both companies  to 
[00:05:00]  take  whatever subscribers  they have  what you would be doing  is pretty much  you know  just about  doubling them  so you  you're doubling  your subscriber base  and then  you can then  pretty much  half your staff  you can cut  half your expenses  and double your income  so  it's a good idea  for both companies  as far as  the finances go  it'll be a bloodbath  oof  yeah  oh I bet 
[00:05:30]  they're scurrying around  when did your  your XM email  finally  go back  online  or is it  everybody  was everybody going  uh oh  I hope I still  got my job  well that's the sad part  about this uh  this merger thing  if it goes through  hundreds of people  will be losing their jobs  hundreds  because there's just  so much redundancy  from both sides too  and that's kind of  kind of  that really is sad  yeah  you know  more sad for the people  that you know  work at XM obviously  well for us 
[00:06:00]  huh  I'm sure the people  that work at Sirius  don't care  well  well whatever  well they're going to  lose a lot of their  people too  yeah  because some of those  people are running  around the halls  like jumping up and down  thinking that  that they won  some kind of  what  war  what did  what did you win  you won nothing  because you know  their boy's going to  be in charge  you know  their boy that  was the one that  actually fired us  for the Sex for Sam  thing  officially Mel Carmeson  fired us  you know  when we blew up  our radio careers  with that little 
[00:06:30]  sex in the church  thing  let me tell you  something Mel  so that makes it  a little scary  because he was  the one that  did fire us  yeah  I would  I would worry  about that  but  I don't care  because  look where we're  sitting right now  who saw this  coming  we're sitting  in  who's old  studio  yeah  Howie's old  studio  working for the  company that  gave us the boot  yeah that's true  good point  good point  you know why 
[00:07:00]  it all comes down  to the almighty  dollar  thank you  I don't want  to be redundant  no you're not  redundant  there's no one  like you Jimmy  there's no other  Jimmy Nortons out  there  see that's the  thing  if I was  Steve or  Thin or  E-Rock  E-Rock  oh my E-Rock  geez there's not  a hundred of those  E-Rock what are you  even doing here  why aren't you  a Kinko's  you should be  a Kinko's  just getting  that resume  redundant 
[00:07:30]  why aren't you  in the toilet  where Ope  left you yesterday  your picture  is next to the  word redundant  redundant  you know how  many of you  there are  in both  companies  oh my god  you should all  get together  and start your  own satellite  company  there's so many  of you  oh my god  put you all  in a room  I wouldn't even  be able to  pick out  our E-Rock  which one's  ours  they all look  the same  they're all 
[00:08:00]  a little  doughy  and stupid  be a dumpster  full of  chubby faced  boys and  headsets  doing things  two minutes  later  dumpster  know how  we can tell  our E-Rock  he doesn't  have the  goatee  all the other  E-Rocks  have the  goatee  and the  baseball cap  that is true  yeah  but they're  all doughy  like me  like the  host  and they all  have clothes  that are  about  well  that shirt's  about ten  years old  E-Rock  you figure  well not  the age  of the shirt  the age  of the person  that should  be wearing  ten years 
[00:08:30]  old  so  everyone's  asking us  questions  I don't  know  we don't  know  how this  is going  to play  out  no one  knows  anything  they just  announced  it  it's going  to be  really  really ugly  they just  announced it  yesterday  and everyone's  already asking  questions like  you know  like anybody's  an insider  let me tell you  who knows  about this  situation  Gary Parsons  from XM  and Mel  Carmisen  from Sirius  they're the  only ones 
[00:09:00]  that know  everything  that's going  on  and that  is planned  and even  they don't  know everything  because  the FCC  and the  SEC  has to  chime in  they got to  go through  all kinds  of hearings  about  antitrust  and monopolies  and see if  the deal  will go  through  if they put  the deal  through  then you're  talking about  more time  logistics  how the hell  do you get  satellites to  talk to each 
[00:09:30]  other  and deliver  content  to units  that were  on purpose  made to  not get  along  it's like  the early  days of  Mac and PC  with personalities  that were  made  not to get  along  exactly  we're not  kissing anyone's  ass  or asses  guaranteed  on that  just  two  god damn  tired  of that  crap  to even  deal with  it  you know  what scares  me 
[00:10:00]  the people  around here  CBS radio  on regular  radio  commercial  radio  terrestrial  radio  if you  will  unusually  quiet  lately  oh what  on this  whole situation  unusually  quiet  that scares  me a little  bit  where  what  not a  peep  I  thought  for sure  they would  get a hold  of us  and go  we really  don't want  you talking  about this  on our  airwaves  because this 
[00:10:30]  is a huge  story  it's in  every  newspaper  big business  story is  what it  is  it's  on the  front page  of USA  today  it's all  over the  place  the news  reports  here in  New York  are trying  to do  reports  on it  but they're  just  dopes  they don't  even know  what satellite  radio is  the local  news  they're  clueless  well I  heard us  mention  they're on  10-10 wins  on the way  in  10-10 wins  10-10 wins  but  boy a lot  of people  with questions 
[00:11:00]  did you have  the ELO  conversation  yesterday  oh yeah  with the  Eric Logan  our  liaison  to management  he is  management  but he's  like our  liaison  to upper  management  and he  doesn't  know  he's just  like  I don't  know  I don't  know  what's  going  on  he doesn't  feel too  secure  about his  place  right now  we were  talking about  redundancy  yeah  he might  be  redundant  how can  he be  you never  know  there's another  there's a  blatant  alcoholic  running around  serious  I don't  all right 
[00:11:30]  now if you  took it  that way  he is a  one of a  kind  that is  true  I'm trying  to think  if there's  a guy  over there  with a  down  syndrome  haircut  none  come to  mind  down  syndrome  haircut  alcoholic  who does  his job  over at  serious  is it  barfly  I don't  know man  can't be  redundant  oh this  is going  to get  really  interesting  in the  coming  months  in the  coming  year  and a  half  it's going  to be  very  very  interesting  let's 
[00:12:00]  say hi  to  Josh  in Philly  Josh  hey boys  how are you  hi Josh  what's up  when are you  guys going  to be on  Howard 100  I invented  satellite radio  thank you  no  no  that ain't  happening  Vinny in  Niagara Falls  Vinny what's  up  hey I just  wanted to  point out  that it'd  be a monopoly  if you guys  combine it  they're only  satellite companies  no one's even  brought this up  my  Vinny  quick  call someone  no one's brought 
[00:12:30]  up the fact  that it would  be a monopoly  get a hold of  the media  alright I will  they would  love that news  yep  no problem  punch it out  boys  yeah the FCC  I guess  would have to  change their  rules  to allow this  to go through  the contracts  that were  signed  and the  regulations  that were  signed  by the FCC  have in it  specifically  it says  the two  companies  are forbidden  from joining  into one  company  that's how  it's written 
[00:13:00]  right now  forbidden  because of  the monopoly  they don't  want a monopoly  it's not in  the best  interest  to serve  the public  so  some people  have said  that that  could be  changed  I guess  one member  of the FCC  last night  after all  this hoopla  went down  yesterday  said something  like  well  let's just  say  this is  going to  be a  very high  hurdle  so  they're 
[00:13:30]  obviously  keeping  the door  open  but  they're  being  realistic  as to  how  hard  this  is  going  to  be  there  are  a lot  of  people  against  this  every  terrestrial  broadcaster  is against  this  the National  Association  of Broadcasters  who is like  the union  of radio  stations  is completely  against it  and they're  a pretty  big  Washington  lobby  so  whether it  even goes  down or  not  who knows  once it  does  again  logistics  machinery 
[00:14:00]  has to  be sorted  out first  how do  you keep  both  sides  happy  you don't  want to  you don't  want to  say  okay  we're  just  going to  be using  an  XM  unit  the  serious  units  are now  wiped  out  or vice  versa  we're  just  using  serious  units  you got  to get  a new  one  now  you're  pretty  much  cutting  off  that  half  of  the  revenue  flow  that's  supposed  to  take  care  of  why  you  did  the  merger  in  the  first  place  the  units  aren't  compatible  so  you need  new  units  the  car  deals  oh  my  god  now  when  do  you  start  i feel 
[00:14:30]  like  i'm  back  in  a  classroom  i'm  writing  down  is there  gonna be  a pop  quiz  i have  a gm  vehicle  and i  have a  ford  vehicle  my  gm  has  xm  my  ford  has  serious  what  the  hell  are you  gonna  do  when  do  the  car  companies  start  rolling  out  cars  that  get  both  of  these  or  get  whatever  format  they're  gonna  go  to  do  they  start  loading  them  into  every  vehicle  new  deals  are  gonna  have  to  be 
[00:15:00]  worked  out  with  the  car  companies  professor  anthony  slow  down  it  is  uh  like  before  it  gets  down  to  um  opium  anthony  where  we  put  them  you  gotta  pretty  much  satisfy  the  uh  mechanical  logistics  of  six  or so  satellites  orbiting  the  planet  and  which  ones  are  going  to  be  used  so  do you  do you  use  all of  them  do you  spin  three  all  of  them  does  the  government  say  does 
[00:15:30]  the  government  say  you  use  three  all right  you  now  need  three  leave  them  somewhere  because  we  need  that  and  the  bandwidth  just  in case  another  party  wants  to  come  in  and  become  a  satellite  radio  company  so  it's  not  a  monopoly  not  a  monopoly  so  you  gotta  leave  your  satellites  alone  and  it's  not  like  Joe  satellite  radio  guy  can  just  go  I'm  gonna  launch  some  satellites  launching  I'm  gonna  start  my  own  company  from  a  farm  is  there  a lot  of  overhead  in  launching 
[00:16:00]  satellites  into  outer  space  there  it's  just  a  and  these  are  just  a  few  of  the  questions  I  was  able  to  come  up  with  in  my  own  head  all  right  it's  ridiculous  the amount  of  work  that has  to  go  into  this  I  have  a  question  who's  gonna  paint  the  new  boxes  with  the  new  unit  covers  all  right  see  that's  another  big  good  question  who's  gonna  paint  the  boxes  you  little  retard  let's  go to  Andrew  in  California  hey 
[00:16:30]  guys  no  one's  really  bothered  to  ask  I  would  guess  Mexicans  by the  way  of  course  yeah  we  all  know  everyone  wanted  to  say  it  but  Andrew  what's  up  no  one's  bothered  to  ask  you  guys  how  you  guys  feel  about  this  ah  good  question  good  question  I'm  a little  scared  I'm  a little  scared  scared  I find  this  I like  chaos  yeah  I like  duh  we love  a little  chaos  we love  stirring  the crap 
[00:17:00]  up  and this  here  is what  we call  excitement  see we  come in  here on  a daily  basis  we enjoy  ourselves  we try  to do  the best  show  we can  it's  fun  it's  fun  to hang  out  but  we always  love  a good  monkey  wrench  being  wailed  into the  side  of our  head  every so  often  and go  where did  that come  from  who threw  that  we made  our careers  living among  chaos  yeah among  chaos  hanging on by  our fingernails  so guess what  welcome home  welcome home  we're back  to chaos  we don't know 
[00:17:30]  what's gonna  happen but  that's the  exciting part  it can be  really really  good for us  or it can  be really  really bad  for us  and I know  that is so  vague but  that is the  God's honest  truth  because the  guy that  if this  goes through  the guy  that's gonna  be in charge  nowhere we  stand with  the guy  we haven't  talked to him  and I was  figuring out  last night  about four  four and a half  years  yeah there was  a time we  sort of got  along with him  but he was  the one that  fired us  for sex  for Sam  so that  was what  August 2002 
[00:18:00]  I think we  talked to him  in April 2002  so we're  talking almost  five years  yeah five years  since the last  time we even  talked to the  guy  since we  talked to him  I saw him  on the street  once and I'm  so glad that  I wasn't  stupid that  day I  was walking  in Times Square  and he  you're gonna  bitch slap  him  he was coming  down the  sidewalk I'm  like oh my  god here's  my chance  here's four  years of  frustration  walking right  toward me  whack that  tan face  I'll smack  that tan 
[00:18:30]  off your  face  smack those  caterpillars  off his  face  that would  be his  eyebrows  yes  and you  know what  I behaved  and you  know what  five years  later  this was  about a  year ago  I'm like  yeah  I guess I  did the  right thing  we also  obviously  because we're  broadcasting here  right now  we don't have  all our eggs  in one basket  kind of like  that too  but they're  being very  quiet over  here I  don't like  that  what does  that mean  what does  it mean 
[00:19:00]  how have  they been  quiet  they haven't  said a peep  we just  got in  and no  one's  here  dude this  was going  down all  day yesterday  I thought  I'd get  one phone  call  late last  night  with what  the FCC  thinks of  this whole  thing  and that  the hurdles  would be  really  really high  but you  could still  jump over  high hurdles  they do it  all the time  in the Olympics  Kevin Martin  the head of the FCC  I think he  said that  if both  companies  can show  that it's  the good 
[00:19:30]  of the public  interest  yeah  that's  what they  want  the good  of the  public  interest  let's go  to Mike  on Long  Island  Mike  what's up  my question  is  would you  and Howard  actually be  able to  get along  together  absolutely  not  can we  coexist  I guess  so  we worked  for the same  company before  and we were  both very  successful  if that's  any indicator  but let me  just say  I think  that little  blue doggy  is adorable 
[00:20:00]  and  I have  like I said  I have a  Ford  I have a  Mustang  which only  has Sirius  in it  I don't  have XM  and I  thoroughly  enjoy the  programming  and Howard  Stern  what  what hasn't  been said  about him  what have  we not  said about  him  that  hasn't  been said  before  by us  I wish  you guys  good luck  with that  if I see  that blue  dog  I'm going  to take  my finger  and put  it under  his chin  and go  hello 
[00:20:30]  give it a  little scratch  come on  well this  is  what  let's go  to Tim  in Jersey  Tim  what's  going on  yeah  Robin  they failed  there on  XM  yeah  XM's worth  nothing  that's why  we're giving  them  you know  4.6  shares  of  Sirius  Star  for one  stock  of 
[00:21:00]  XM  who  who  how come  because  that might  be because  Sirius stock  is like  3 bucks  yeah  an XM  stock  is like  13  you know  like  there's a  reason  that they  do  stock  oh boy  is he  trying to  spin that  oh yeah  the stock  is all  math  it's easy  it's not  interpreted  like  English  it's math  it works  one way  the reason  they give  you a certain  amount of  shares  of one  company  for  one share 
[00:21:30]  of another  company  is because  the other  company  is worth  four times  the share  of the other  company  like Sirius's  shares  are at a  certain price  and four  times that  is one  XM share  so that's  why you get  four shares  of Sirius  for every  share of  XM  it's math  let it be  known  because they're  going to  spin it  like crazy  in their  camp  they were  at like  a 52  week  low  their stock 
[00:22:00]  believe me  if they  were doing  so good  there wouldn't  be a merger  Howard never  moved the  stock  in his  time at  Sirius  he's moved  it down  if there  was  if either  one of  these  satellite  companies  was kicking  ass  they'd have  told the  other one  to go  screw  when approached  with the  merger  the  truth of  the matter  here is  both  companies  have an  advantage  in merging  with the  other one  that's it  because they're  both  bleeding  cash 
[00:22:30]  is what's  happening  and this  is a way  to double  your revenue  with the  subscribers  and cut  your  expenses  that's it  there's no  one company  was kicking  ass so much  that they  decided to  buy up  the other  company  this is an  equal merger  Mel would be  CEO  but the  board members  would be  equally divided  between  XM and  Sirius  that's how  it works  according to the  press release  XM gets  seven  and Sirius  gets five 
[00:23:00]  board members  gets five  yeah  how do you  know Mel  would run  it  I mean Mel  calls me a lot  I just never  return his  calls  you might want  to return that  call  that would be  a smart one  there Jimmy  be the CEO  and then  Gary would be  the head of  the board  chairman of the  board like  Frank Sinatra  I don't know  does he just  go around singing  all day  about dames  is that his job  I'm the chairman  of the board  baby  I'm gonna  point at the  redundant one  to get us out  of here for a little

[00:39:00]  you guys will still listen to  something  and you'd have to get up into outer  space to do that  it's always a  i know but this they're just gonna  it's gonna end up trying to divide you  two and jimmy we'll never hear from  jimmy when that happens  well that's thanks sir  that is true we've already had those  discussions behind the scenes  what discussions jimmy's a part of  this program  no we've had the discussions and you  don't have to like fake it anymore  what discussions  all right well eric rules man have a  good day boys  all right thank you joe 
[00:39:30]  bye fella  it's a it's every radio guy's dream  that you know you get fired or  something and your whole audience  like decides that they're never gonna  listen to radio again  ah but you know  it never happens  they listen  they go they they have to move on  with their lives eventually  they might have a protest for like a  week and then  then they find something new they  like  yeah  listen to  by the way have you noticed um on  all the news stories uh because we  are so hated by the news because of  our assaults on the media and other 
[00:40:00]  things that um we only get mentioned  on the cbs uh channels yeah oh really  oh yeah  fox is making a point of just not even  acknowledging because we're we give we  torture them with the assaults on the  media no filter paul goes after them  with no uh no mercy so we'll uh  well we might we'll ramp it up a  little bit we might have a little  surprise for the media  yep so yeah they're talking about  like crazy all over the news today 
[00:40:30]  i think we'll play a lot of those  clips over at the other joint  yeah when we really really get into  it  uh let's say hi to vanessa in  jersey vanessa what's up  hey i wanted to know if you guys  caught uh tyra show yesterday  not only did we catch it we got uh we  got the best clips in front of us we  have to oh there's that have to  again oh boy  we we choose to that's what i want to  say we choose to yeah we choose to 
[00:41:00]  play some of the tyra clips sam  where's sam yeah i'm right here do you  think you're redundant  oh do you do you think there's an  equivalent to you think at the other  joint no do you think there is  somebody wandering the halls of  serious satellite radio with a head  full of candy not one person not  even you no according to you but if  your job came down to it uh-huh and  uh your special talent was having a  head full of candy i think you'd start 
[00:41:30]  loosening up on that my head isn't  full of candy thing i'd like to think  that i bring more to the table but if  that's what it is that's what it is  what's on your neck that's a scratch  what happened scratch my doggy oh  that's adorable dog scratched you was he  kissing your face i sat down on the  step to say hello and he jumped up he's  very excited because nobody was home and  wait a minute did he have a meeting  with serious already and the little doggy  got you ready oh i'm not saying are you 
[00:42:00]  having secret meetings behind our back  was he trying to get a candy treat no  were those with those his back claws at  your neck as he was applying lipstick to  you no he was giving him kisses and in dog  uh technique a kiss is the same thing they  do with their filthy bits all right just  sit there and lick them to clean them what  are we got on the tyrant thing well  tyrus celebrated black history month  yesterday on the show now i can only  imagine um let me think uh some black 
[00:42:30]  the activists on uh maybe um going over  some famous black inventors uh talking  about black history and how they've  overcome so much adversity black women in  the media uh black like oprah things  like that maybe uh absolutely things like  that and uh wow i applaud tyra for  bringing such substance to black history  month on her no that's not what she did  oh no all right she applauded one specific 
[00:43:00]  black woman in the media though let's see  oh let me think who it could be harriet  tubman i was actually wait rosa parks  rosa parks that's huge that's huge  my angelo oh okay or angelo whatever the  hell her poet poet poet name poet laureate i  know it is uh coretta scottkin there you go  the uh wife stand by her man that's right no  it was oh my god i should have known betty 
[00:43:30]  shabazz betty shabazz right malcolm x's uh  wife mm-hmm as a matter of fact it was tyra  banks ah now who would have thought that  tyra banks would celebrate black history month by by  paying tribute are you kidding to tyra banks  what a self-centered ass this woman is are you  kidding no one is specifically uh her  groundbreaking yeah cover of the sports 
[00:44:00]  illustrated swimsuit issue wow there are so  many black women when you think of the top  hundred moments in black history you know  what you gotta put that at the top yeah  tyra on the cover of sports illustrated  swimsuit issue she's the hair of the slave  master yeah she really said she's honoring black  history month by talking about this not only by  talking about it but she said she's paying  tribute to black history month by retaking the 
[00:44:30]  same picture now oh oh boy oh wait a minute  isn't she fat she is uh supposedly 20 pounds heavier now than she was 10 years ago  uh-huh all right listen let's let's break because we got to get into this yeah please  redundant one you're there oh redundant one hey can i hear the e-rock smack scream  oh you certainly can oh my god that smack is not altered i must i can't stress this enough that smack is exactly as it sounded yesterday on mic no processing this is exactly what happened 
[00:45:00]  it sounds like he belted her in the face jim just looks disgusted every time he hears it are you disgusted jim well jim's a connoisseur jim knows how to spank a girl where she enjoys it and he enjoys doing it and he does it right and and e-rock is just this bumbling retard going full bore with a cinder block over a girl's head and calling that a spanking 
[00:45:30]  he's the type of guy that would like uh but you know choke a kitten out by accident yeah yeah you go look i got this nice kitten you want to you want to hold it for a minute and he just doesn't know what to do and all the next thing you know it's dead on the floor  you i don't know what i did you've killed it jimmy are you a lot of spank girls still um now that you're in love oh yeah yeah she goes for that she says go out and do as you will  no i mean if it's for the radio show though she definitely understands all right can we get can we maybe get a girl down here 
[00:46:00]  so jimmy could show e-rock how it's done how it's done because this is a little disturbing because here's an example of how not to do it  that was the first one too first one and she was bleeding after that maybe you work up to that  i don't know depending on how crazy you want to get with your lady some girls maybe you don't start with the  knockout punch since he came out like tyson right you want to start with a few jabs he wound his arm up like you  remember dan quizzenberry the pitcher the underhanded pitcher for the royals that was how his like one of 
[00:46:30]  those underhanded quizzenberry oh my goodness i used to love his cereal quizzenberry i was thinking  louis tion myself louis tion's even better the other hand slap all right uh well we'll get into the  tire clips next it's the opian anthony show  you're checking out the opian anthony show 
[00:47:00]  anthony just went on a rant about poker during the break  well you were in atlantic city doing some of that uh hold them right playing hold them hey  like uh six o'clock saturday night until seven o'clock uh sunday morning what's your thought  by the way before i get into this poker thing for a couple seconds and then we'll go into tyra  um elliot spitzer here in new york allowing a casino to be built in the in the catskills 
[00:47:30]  to catskills isn't that kind of far away from anything anyway yeah but casinos are popping up  all over america at this point i i just don't think that's the smartest thing to do source of revenue  it's a great source of revenue but people can't help themselves it back in the day you know if you  wanted to gamble you really had to you know take a road trip you had to travel maybe get a travel  agent you know take the bus i'll take the jitney down to atlantic city they got a casino like in 
[00:48:00]  the suburbs of philadelphia now it's like oh boy that's not the smart that's just not smart and now  i see in the paper today the catskills they're just popping up everywhere i don't know if you're  in that mindset that you got to protect everybody from themselves then uh of course they shouldn't  build them but i kind of i'm kind of like you know if if you can't control yourself and you have  a problem that's your that's your problem the rest of us i'm having fun with these idiots just 
[00:48:30]  the gambling way everything yeah that's all you see when you go to atlantic city no one no one walks  away a winner nobody there's a handful of people been happening for years that's why i play poker  not playing the casino i'm playing other people that's it that's the game it's a pure game it's  wonderful but there's this uh trend it's been going on for a while but it's really just getting  so goddamn annoying that uh i can't take it ever since uh tv started playing the world series of 
[00:49:00]  poker the world poker tour um or every every other thing celebrity poker um everybody uh considers  themselves a champ the best of the best and uh they're talking smack and everything and that's  fine but now you get these people that just want to look like they're a professional poker player  they just want to look the part and they all got stories that that's all they do and they're mostly 
[00:49:30]  guys in their 20s or 30s that uh sit down they're dressed like their favorite poker stars they have to  have logo hats on and shirts and sunglasses and they sit there and do and play the game  like they're on tv they play they sit there and toil over a hand uh that that you would think they 
[00:50:00]  were playing for five million ten million dollars in the world series of poker meanwhile you know  you're at the two five table but you anthony are smart enough to see a table like that and go oh this  is gonna be easy fish they're gonna this is gonna be easy because they're just they're just looking  the part let me sit at a table with a bunch of people that want to look like their professional  poker player one thing i love the goddamn ipods oh that when they pop those buds in and crank up  their tunes i know they're not paying attention they're not paying attention some people could do 
[00:50:30]  that you watch and you watch the pros they've been playing for so many years and they're they're so  good at it that maybe they could pop in the earbuds listen to some tunes and actually pay attention  what if they're they're popping on the ipods but they're not listening to anything at all  it's their their trickery then it's stupid sit down and play the goddamn game that's that's all  there is to it so you don't have an outfit is when you're playing hold up it's whatever i had on me 
[00:51:00]  anthony needs an outfit driving into atlantic city for his weekends when he's uh off playing poker  because it's happening more and more by the way with ant and told me yesterday he's convinced that  he could quit radio tomorrow and play poker i'll just play poker that's all i'll do i might lose  everything i've earned over the past a few years but i would just play poker the wizard i'll be they'll  call me the wizard the wizard everyone wants a name and they all got to wear the the stuff and just  play the game i don't know how many people i knocked out that looked like they wanted to play in 
[00:51:30]  the world series of poker with their their their ipods and hats with the the full tilt logos on them  and everything and they're just sitting there losing just bleeding chips and you sit there and  play you're patient you can just sit wait bet and just nail these people it was great i bought in uh  like uh i was a 500 buy-in played for a few hours walked away with over uh 2100 bucks look at you 
[00:52:00]  just just and just kind of playing a nice relaxing game with no big pressure you know i gotta win  gotta do this just being patient having fun and watching these idiots playing uh uh poker like they  think it's supposed to be played because they watch it like that on the tv what's the worst outfit you've  seen in a game worst one is uh a guy and this is just this past week you can see it at any time  it's not even like you gotta pick them out it was a guy with this button shirt that was nothing but 
[00:52:30]  fanned out cards on it he had fanned out cards on it with uh like straights and full houses and all good  hands all over it and uh sunglasses okay and just that miserable look like a poker face could be  anything you could sit and talk you could smile you can look at people you could do things like 
[00:53:00]  that but there's the people that just want to sit there and and not even put on put on faces  i'm just gonna sit here i'm gonna be like a ventriloquist i'm not even gonna move my lips  don't look at anyone don't talk don't do anything you give yourself away like that even worse than you  do if you're just acting like yourself so what happened to the guy that had all those nice hands on  all that bye-bye early gone early pretty early yeah he was another all-in guy there's the people 
[00:53:30]  that think bluffing is just when you have a crappy hand go all in everyone will fold and that works a  couple of times right up until it don't work right up until you're biting your tongue going the second  i have a hand this guy is so dead so dead and then he gets called someone gets a hand he gets called he's  out and then they leave in a huff there's also another thing that's happening at the poker tables  the pissed off guy oh boy this guy's a treat at any table whenever he loses a hand it's never the fault 
[00:54:00]  it's never his fault for playing so poorly it's always the guy that won it's his fault for betting  on something that he bet on for getting lucky for doing it's never the guy's fault for betting the  crap he had that he never should have been in the hand oh and he gets and when you wipe him out  they get up and start screaming dude i'm not coming back here again this place sucks i'm going to the 
[00:54:30]  drop the tropical go just leave those are the people with the big problems just problems it's people that  won't leave the table to even go to the bathroom they're sitting on their foot rocking back and forth  it's like dude once the dealer button passes you just just get up and walk away from the table for  a few minutes go to the bathroom wash your hands splash a little water get yourself a beverage just 
[00:55:00]  relax and people have no clue and they sit there over pressured over they think they're they i swear to  you they think that that they're sitting there with 10 million dollars on the table with all right and  here it is it's the last play here it is the last hand and then we have a new champion we have a new  champion you're playing two five it's two dollars five dollar blinds relax relax have fun with it 
[00:55:30]  what's the longest you've uh set at a table about 14 hours 14 hours yeah that wasn't this past time  this time was about 12 oh but what was wrong with you i was actually here's what happened i was i was  very tired it was seven in the morning i was getting really tired i was up i was really up  and uh they were moving us to another table because they had a tournament going on the next day so they  had to clean out and clean up the whole area so they were moving us to another table so i load up my  chips in the racks and i'm going to walk over to the other table and i kind of looked and just looked 
[00:56:00]  at my watch and looked at the table and looked at the chip the cashier was right there and i said you  know something it's time just cash your man go to sleep you idiot yeah and that's what i'd done so you  gotta sound like you know what you do at the table i'll always say things like uh hey uh you know  sir you don't know when to hold them and when to fold them when they hear gambling like that they  know i mean business now that's a winner yep right there they would be afraid of you i have a tell  though like they say every player has a tell yeah i try i would always try a poker face but whenever i  would get at least a pair i would go oh i don't know what do you think that's what i would do every 
[00:56:30]  time it's time to bet oh i don't know what do you think if i had nothing i'd be dead face but if i  had a jacket and i threw it at you threw me another jack it'll be uh it's to you  and then i'd know what you had i'd be always at least a pair yeah clear the throat guy  what do you if you do that when you have a pair what happens if you have like uh three of a kind 
[00:57:00]  it's it was the worst because people would say all right maybe he's got the pair and nothing else  but um i would i would if the third one would come i would i would wait where would the third one  come by the way where you know you know poker yeah yeah well sometimes you got what what does he  have pocket what it uh let's say he's got uh pocket jacks all right you pick them up and right  away you have a pair you got a you got pocket jacks so where's the third jack coming from no  show your poker knowledge you pick up the pair so what do you do when you see the pair 
[00:57:30]  okay so now i know he's got a pocket pair all right but now there's gonna be a third jack but  where's that third jack coming from jimmy show them show them you know that's the next card dealt  it's the three cards community cards that come out which is called the the pot it's the kitty  i love jimmy's poker lingo the auntie yes it's the auntie pot it's part of the auntie that would  be the flop yeah of course the flop yeah the flop now let's say everybody right the flop comes out 
[00:58:00]  and there's another jack now you have three jack right i just i i i just i mumble one to go  that's good i gotta play with you one of these days  i'm going to atlantic city this weekend i don't sit i don't sit at the poker tables though no

[00:59:00]  just sitting there and and and be patient wait for good hands learn the game and that's a good  time too yeah you'll be your money last you're socializing you're not you're not pouring through  money right and uh you're you're learning a fun game iraq why every morning do i have to look at  pictures of a naked pregnant chick what are you doing with those pictures mr redundant i'm editing  all the old redundant i love how he's just redundant now i'm editing the old photos and putting them up  but every day we have to look at this girl there's a lot of pregnant photos oh no it's the same girl 
[00:59:30]  i know this girl this is the one that came in she was nine months pregnant and we wanted to try to  give birth live on our show we talked about this already i think uh late last week you've had her  in three times so there's three different calories are you kidding no what was wrong with us  she's sexy i don't blame you dude yeah and she never gave birth which was a drag so we're gonna  have to do that ever she's still pregnant we're gonna have to do that bit again oh oh before the  break yeah imagine uh before the break so so you will show iraq how to spank a girl did we did we 
[01:00:00]  decide that's gonna happen today of course all right we need a girl in the area to come in  jimmy's gonna spank you because uh we have to teach iraq how to spank girls because anthony if you will  could you play that clip again if you got it handy this is iraq from late yesterday in the show girl  comes in and we say iraq spanked this uh this this mess of a woman everyone knows what a spanking  sounds like too it's it's i you know i i described it's more of a slap you give like that a slap not  like you're hitting a side of beef and remember this is just one microphone near her butt cheek 
[01:00:30]  as iraq smacked her and it made this sound and then she made a sound  that is real do people understand that's real that is a hell of a because there's a lot of  people listening right now that didn't hear that yesterday this is what he did yesterday  he should be that sounds he sounds like he's hitting like like raw meat in front of paulie yeah  that's what that sounds like in the original rocky who's beating that meat in the freezer 
[01:01:00]  all right so we need a girl to come down jimmy's gonna do a spanking uh uh exhibition  to show iraq how it's done there's a whole thing like i i've seen jimmy spank girls before  you know you you have to kind of like uh rub the butt a little bit smooth it out give him a couple  slaps then you rub a little bit some more there's a whole thing that has to happen iraq iraq what would  you say when you're spanking a girl because when you're disciplining somebody you have to discipline  them no could you call him his real name yeah e-redundant what would you say e-redundant what's up

[01:06:00]  of the handprint i guess where the you know the palm is obviously it it just broke the skin wide  open it looks like a paintball wound yeah when you get hit at close range with a paintball gun  yeah well i have to say this morning it's not that bad really a little black and blue it's uh it didn't  get any bigger it's just a little bit darker uh so it's just basically that spot where he broke the  blood vessels oh does it hurt to sit oh no 
[01:06:30]  so so it was no big deal no this this sounded a lot worse it sounded a lot worse all right well  i'm looking at the pictures and i see a huge red handprint and it's bleeding god how fat are you  that didn't hurt i mean come on let's be honest with each other it's no big deal  i'm looking at i'm looking at some serious damage to your butt right now that would have left like a 
[01:07:00]  black and blue on anybody yeah the size of of a fist it doesn't look pretty it definitely doesn't  look pretty but it well didn't beforehand because it's big that's terrific i thought  current had a nice big spankable bottom it was definitely spankable in a frederica bimmel  type of way right but uh are you wearing better panties yeah you picked the wrong day to get  assaulted by e-rock i know i definitely was not prepared are you wearing something any any sexier 
[01:07:30]  these days i'm wearing the boy shorts today anthony oh good nice got him off a boy sure she's actually  wearing a boy's shorts thinks that's what we meant yeah this big pair underwear sylvester the cat on  him with some of the topical cartoon character that am i an ass sylvester she had a sambo on  her panties that's the fool i am all right corinne there's your update thank you all right we'll be

[01:08:30]  really really done oh it's done i'm filling up in preparation well will you sit down sit there  please sit down he's gotta he's gotta stand up and show everybody i wanted to press it against  the console by the way jimmy i was lying not one i know girl ready to take one for the team come  on please jimmy wants to show e-rock how a spanking is done the right way but i and i gotta say it's a  very subjective thing they may prefer the the brutality of the hun to a to a to a different 
[01:09:00]  type of spanking i like that this gets better and better so hopefully one girl will call us and  and say that she's in the area she could come by and uh and jimmy will do it uh the right way for  everybody hey mark what's up hey what's going on i think the funniest thing about that is opie's  reaction that little two-second pause and then it's just what the hell is wrong with you yeah  yeah i mean i i turned on uh on e-rock fast i was in corinne's corner yeah that was just twisted how 
[01:09:30]  that went down yesterday all right so tyra banks uh celebrating black history month yesterday yes  uh we found out it wasn't by honoring any of the uh black women in history that have uh changed things  um that uh black people that just owe the owe some of these women uh so much but she didn't choose  one of them she chose herself like she always does i think she should have i think she's done a lot 
[01:10:00]  for black people uh-huh uh-huh and um i i think that a lot of women i mean oprah's kind of has done  really very little to bring black women to the forefront oh i know yeah what is she what has she done  really really holiday another another non-contributor musically well tyra has to make it about  herself i mean we've been talking about this for for a while now did she do a uh panty party uh i don't  think she know sometimes i'm a bad boy yeah i was only joking negro 
[01:10:30]  all right anyway this is what tyra had to say yesterday this is just unbelievable this is her big 
[01:11:00]  announcement all right everyone as we all know february is black history month and today i'm  honoring black history by celebrating an event that not only changed my life and the direction of my  career but more importantly it impacted the face of beauty for women of color everywhere this month 
[01:11:30]  marks the 10-year anniversary of my appearance on the cover of sports illustrated magazine swimsuit edition  what this is not real you know this cannot be real if someone else did this for her it would even be  too much like if someone said tyra i have a show what we want to do is honor you as a black woman uh  in in history here during black history month remember you were the first black woman on the cover of  sports illustrated yeah so we want to kind of uh pay tribute to you and then she should at that point go 
[01:12:00]  please there are so many other important black women in history more deserve that i would not even  agree i'll agree to help you with another woman in history but i cannot possibly do this that's if  someone else would do it it would be ridiculous this passes any bit of ridiculous and goes into the  realm of another planet this was report uh important to her and her only it's sociopathic right 
[01:12:30]  sociopathic it is sociopathic it she is she's insane she needs mental help no one gave a crap  that uh she was the first black woman on the cover of sports do you hear how she's talking about it  did you hear that that the presentation there was like it was going to be something huge but it's like  in a country that like you know i did have slavery she's saying that this is a place where i was just 
[01:13:00]  kind of looked at as an object yeah that's lovely here i was i remember when they snapped my picture  and checked my teeth it's amazing and let's be honest she's barely black yeah i mean if it was like  a real real real real dark woman on the cover of sports right swimsuit issue man then you would take  notice yeah you would take notice really  if what's the name erica badu yeah there you go if she was on the cover now you're talking some 
[01:13:30]  history being made oh yeah there's some hot piece of ass tyra especially back then look at the original  cover the original cover from uh a bit of a distance you would swear that's a white girl on the cover  that's of uh sports illustrated swimsuit issue it's kind of a good tan yeah she's working with there now  that picture right there is not that big a deal to black women no it's just a it's a hot girl she  transcends her race right there the the clan a clan member can can reach under his robe and and get it 
[01:14:00]  moving into that picture that's how unblack she is in that absolutely listen to this next clip because  this will really send it over the top and it meant so much to me because the moment the decisions  to put me on that cover was made it was a decision to recognize and celebrate black beauty and  ultimately what that si cover did was it enabled young women of color to realize that they can dream 
[01:14:30]  big are you insane yes you're insane yes yes are you insane she has to make everything about  herself is it illegal to put a hit on someone on the radio i'm just i i i don't know i think  there's an exception oh my god we've been on to her for a long time where she's her ego has to be fed  constantly and it's all about her but this just this takes it to a level i never thought she would  ever go hold on max in dallas has a comment uh max go ahead hey what's up boys well according to 
[01:15:00]  tyra rosa parks is a hack just an ugly broad of the bus yeah screw her i brought beauty yeah this is  just like rosa parks she taught black women they could dream she's using the same terminology that  like king used yeah dreaming what are you dreaming about i have a dream i have two mountains i've seen  the two mountains yeah there are marches that someday men will be able to scrap to malata women the same 
[01:15:30]  way they do to white women the only people that are keeping track at uh the black people being the  first at something or are a small percentage of the black uh race yeah the black population a very  small percentage so i want to give them some credit today they don't even give a crap who who's the  first uh black to do this and that at this point wouldn't you think like the first black like  senator or first female black uh astronaut of course yeah oh my god george is on to something 
[01:16:00]  george is on to something uh and and it goes right back to her ego and all that go ahead george  oh and a little jimmy good morning fellas hi i like your observation go ahead george i just think  this has a lot to do with beyonce looking so good on the cover that sports illustrated issue she wants  to bring it back to her she was a friend she looked good and she knows she doesn't look that good  anymore yeah for the people that aren't keeping track beyonce's on the latest uh sports 
[01:16:30]  illustrated swimsuit issue beyonce this year looking beyond hot uh i think they did some  airbrushing to kind of slim that butt down of hers but yeah but you got to give her credit she looks  unbelievable on the cover uh i think you're onto something there george tyra's like oh my god  they're gonna forget about me i gotta bring it back around to me yeah oh she is amazing let's go to  cigars and scotch cigars and scotch what's up hey what about like the uh the civil rights people and  stuff it should be panther party black panthers 
[01:17:00]  she cannot keep things just in perspective it's it's always got to be about her yeah this big  celebration of black history month they put you on the cover because you're a hot piece of ass rap  magazine they weren't making a statement or a stand or any of that crap for black women black women you  just happen to be the hottest girl that year that's it black like that's it look at her hair 
[01:17:30]  look at her oh well that's beyonce that's the same thing that's no celebration of black women either  it's just beyonce is really hot and they wanted her on the cover this year god bless her a black  posed her with natural hair like you know like that's a celebration of black beauty if you put  an african looking woman on the cover who's really smoking hot that's a celebration of black  she says you want jimmy a bone through the nose and plates in her lips i want to hear from the  yeah that's that's a dark woman with short hair that's a celebration i want to hear from the shwuggies  today uh uh let's uh get the shwuggies to call the show i want to hear what uh they're they're 
[01:18:00]  saying about this today uh cousin it what's up uh do you remember the barbara mcnair show back in  like the early 70s it was kind of like a dean martini kind of thing that chick was in playboy uh  uh no you don't remember barbara mcnair no no but pam greer oh well trashed car pam greer how  about the what's her name the daughter from good times thelma thelma she was in a playboy we're not 
[01:18:30]  talking about playboy we're talking about sports illustrated all right let's move on with tyra  now i know a lot of y'all saw me on the cover of people magazine recently did you see me in the  red swimsuit going you called this fat you remember that i was addressing my way remember  no well we we saw it and then we forgot because we moved on with our lives you idiot do you remember  that do you remember that do you remember don't forget about me please please keep talking about  me me me me me me me me me me me me me how long till she shaves her head oh my god oh goes crazy 
[01:19:00]  remember that i was addressing my weight and if you guys thought that me wearing that red body  suit was a big deal y'all ain't seen nothing yet because today it's all about i love how she has  to make her the the dramatic announcement about herself yeah because today it's all about me he's  really trying to sell it to the all-female audience by the way oh get some dudes in that audience yeah 
[01:19:30]  the reaction would be a little different be nodding off i ain't seen nothing yet because today it's all  about this little red polka dot bikini why are they applauding i don't know she got a hanger stuck  with it and in honor of black history month i decided to recreate the sports illustrated cover  that i shot 10 years ago i wanted to recreate it you guys you guys like like she didn't get the 
[01:20:00]  reaction says like i i want to recreate it you guys she can't even talk like a black woman there  she sounds like marcia yeah you guys for black history month oh if i was black i'd be pretty  damn pissed off yeah you got this representing you out there and you are compared to her she's  the whitest chick i've ever seen in my life now uh iraq uh what are we looking at there  that's i see two pictures the one was illustrated and the one is the one she did 10 years ago and 
[01:20:30]  that's the new one on the right uh-huh why hmm yeah those hips kind of got a little wider  she's darker for some reason yeah i think they lightened her up in that first one yeah didn't  well didn't really want to commit to the black woman on the cover did they  oh my god she's got the eight head working on the newer picture and she's got her cleavage and 
[01:21:00]  her hips have started this it started that secretary spread thing where she's holding her hands down  right by her hips yeah now she's kind of doing that in the first one but it's a little more sexy  like she's got her hip kind of cocked one way a little bit and in this one it looks like she's  holding her hips like don't look at these don't look here i'm covering this with my hands and remember  too there's airbrushing involved and the the between her breasts on the newer picture oh boy is 
[01:21:30]  like that's really dark yeah what happened there uh what did someone spray paint graffiti what is that  it's just getting just very dark in there the first one i'm sorry man is actually closer up  they chopped that big dome they chop her giant skull in the first one because her head was too big yeah  and they put the hair down into her face like they gave her kind of bangs yeah this is really deceiving  jimmy makes a good point in the second picture she's backed up to look as small as the uh as the one 
[01:22:00]  she did uh originally yeah they didn't uh they didn't put her as close she's further back in the shot  much much further back someone's got to photoshop that is really actually scale her up to the same  size so we can really get a good view but in the first one they put her close because a she was much  skinnier and and b her head she has a gigantic misshapen head oh my god it is huge i hear there's sonar 
[01:22:30]  in there and that's how she catches her fish she looks like dac  let's go to amanda amanda what's up today hi as a black woman i'm really embarrassed for her you  gotta be laughing yeah that is just so ridiculous yeah like as a black woman to get on a tv show during  black history month and choose herself as the inspiration that young women should have young  black women should have is not only self-serving but it's an insult to black women and the achievements 
[01:23:00]  that other black women have made uh over the years and this is coming from me who is a just ridiculous  racist it is actually an insult i don't you i laugh because it's true  yeah i asked you a question who do you like as a black woman who who would you say yeah would you  be inspired are you inspired by what's that oprah yeah over when i think of someone to inspire me not 
[01:23:30]  tyra oprah is a great rags to riches story like she grew up she got a lot of hardship early on and uh  from what i hear she really worked to get to the position she was at exactly that she's at another  thing tyra is not a typical black woman no who cares no oprah is a black woman you see oprah walking  down the street especially oprah from when when oprah started making it believe me she was looking 
[01:24:00]  like uh she was very fat she definitely wasn't a fashion model it just showed how talented she was  that she was able to make it in uh the media looking like she did especially in the beginning tyra is where  she is today because she's a hot piece of ass that is it period that is it she's not breaking any  boundaries or anything sucks everything that she's accomplished in her life is because she had the  good genes when she was she's been hot that's it exactly all right thank you oprah was never attracted  the color purple was about her cheeks she's never a good looking girl no let's go to fatso she was 
[01:24:30]  great in that let's go to troy the black uh dude from long island troy what up hello hey what's up  guys i like that opie what up yeah i like that all right thanks i'll try to relate what do you got  troy hey listen this stick is about as black as i don't know maybe uh reese witherspoon i mean she's  basically a black bobby doll reese witherspoon it's a tribute to black history month we're uh focusing  on reese witherspoon right well troy also it says here david duke did more for blacks than tyra did you 
[01:25:00]  say that troy yeah i said that to the to the phone screener very nice seriously she's done  nothing she's absolutely done nothing for our community all right love you guys well we got  just a little more tyra because it's just that's just terrific hearing her talk about herself over  and over again and then bet comes up to me it's most vivid memory from the shoot any funny stories  everybody's asking me the same questions but for some reason when bet asked me it just like 
[01:25:30]  like got me in my gut like oh my gosh i'm the little black girl from inglewood and  i'm on the cover of sports illustrated oh my god oh my god she's oh actually playing some type of  race card here i'm just a little black girl from inglewood yeah you look just like every little  black girl from uh inglewood move out of the sticks gentlemen like got me in my gut like oh my gosh i'm 
[01:26:00]  the little black girl from inglewood and i'm on the cover of sports illustrated like i just like  fell apart and i think it's because i knew how many young black girls were going to be watching  that interview and so many young girls don't feel beautiful you know and and they're going to see  this they're not like oh wow mommy you know i can i can have my dreams come true no you can't  i was on that cover and not just dreams of being a model you know but dreams of anything  not just dreams of being a model but like dreams anything being a scientist yeah you know something 
[01:26:30]  lower on the scale a model being you know the best thing but you know curing diseases  i yeah yeah i can't not or i can't get enough of tyra talking about herself i could listen to this all  day long she just must she's delusional walk around all day thinking how great she is sam's  got something to add here no yes maybe no what about you are you inspired your half blackness  by uh tyra no not i'm inspired that she could manage to get a television show and focus around

[01:32:30]  be part of the meeting you can't yay yourself you need to be humble right she knows not that word  it's humble she said like oh guys stop stop like yeah yeah oh no you know i got there's a little something  it's similar i could tell but i oh i wish i looked like i did back then but right it's you know  the same suit and i think for my age okay it was 10 years ago none of that i look great  wow this is fantastic more confetti she's like how she feeds her ego she's like a drug addict 
[01:33:00]  yeah she needs it she is addicted to that ego feed you're right yeah i just know we're not doing it  justice i just know i wish we could it's just beyond unbelievable don't feel bad because it is  impossible to do it right only only her she's throwing a parade for herself she's throwing  how much would it cost to take out an ad in entertainment weekly a full page ad that just  says tyra is a fat pig tyra's a fat they wouldn't run pig yeah a self-serving fat pig hollywood just 
[01:33:30]  goes with it gets that music going and she's like oh and what was she doing was she looking at a picture  of the swimsuit edition next to the old one yeah that same one that uh eric okay so she wasn't  in her bikini on stage oh no no no so they could have done magic with that well not only could they 
[01:34:00]  have they did they they did talking about how she had a pimple on the day of the shoot oh and then  there was no why don't we have the pimple clip get back in that office and get us the pimple my god  what is wrong with you sam that candy in your head is affecting your brain we gotta release some  of that candy out of your brain so what she did all right anyway was air they airbrushed and made a  faux sports illustrated cover yes where was the pimple it was on her face and she talked about the pimple 
[01:34:30]  she had on her face yes it was on her forehead can i get that clip is it good is it good yeah i'll get  it all right thank you sam we just uh can't get enough of tyra well she can't get enough of herself  let me let me take a look her face and head is really irritatingly not attractive well i'm not  just bashing a hot chick she has a big all right i hope that people see that the two pictures side by  side because it's an illusion going on here too they they put her back in the second shot so it balances 
[01:35:00]  out with the one she did 10 years ago if you brought her more front and center she would be  so much fatter than the original picture and she's not doing the same lean the uh her crotch area the  magazines themselves the pictures are the same size but her picture on it her crotch in the initial one  is maybe a quarter inch from the bottom of the magazine on the new shot it is a full inch above that's 
[01:35:30]  how how much smaller her picture is zoom this in to the full size she is in the original she will  look giant can we do that on our website you can photoshop it can we photoshop and move the picture  where it's supposed to be cigars and scotch get to work on that no i'm serious because this is something  the world needs to know there's an illusion going on there too if you move her more front and center  you'll realize how much bigger that bathing suit really is and how much wider she really is and how  much fatter she is and she's not looking like she does like a little sexy tilt in the first one where 
[01:36:00]  she's kind of got her hip out she's just standing like a little kid on picture day there's she can't  she can't do any tilts in the second shot because then the rolls would show she's leaning as far back  as possible this picture is awful and it's unnatural and stiff the first one she had oil on she's all  yeah she's oiled up her hair is in front of that big bulbous forehead her face just looks better  the first one i mean yeah who wouldn't uh do just awful things to that body thomas jefferson you don't 
[01:36:30]  blame him  and all right we would do awful things with the second one but but she's she's not uh completely  representing what's going on there really airbrushed look how smooth and bright over here on her thighs  all right all right all right all right all right all right yes i got a picture of you just a  regular photo of you in a bikini yep photoshopped that i want to see it in full size do you know how  destroyed she was by those pictures from australia she's redoing this bikini shot she read it 
[01:37:00]  that destroyed her psyche because that's her whole life is meeting her ego if she doesn't have that she  has nothing can we get some i would like if people are going to do assault on the media please have fat  tyra picture on the sign right all right it's uh it's us and you like us so keep listening  hear what everyone else is talking about on a uncut and live continuing the show on xm satellite  radio starting at 9 a.m eastern visit xmradio.com to subscribe it's the opian anthony show

[01:38:00]  she's playing us i don't know i don't think so she's playing us to keep her name in the uh the old  press until she figures out how to make the big comeback you give her too much credit  all right then explain why she would have this complete breakdown yeah in front of everybody  wouldn't you just do it in your mansion if you're really going nuts no because it's not her compound  she's got a compound it's not a complete movie like breakdown she didn't have one of those how did 
[01:38:30]  the paparazzi know that she was going to do this she's just they follow her everywhere they follow  her every i just watched the show these guys use uh the paparazzi as well i i truly believe almost i  think almost anyone could get around without the paparazzi following them if they really wanted to  uh i really do not someone like britney or there are just too many rats that tell where they're going  to be i think she kind of she kind of lost it not to the point where she's like babbling in the bottom 
[01:39:00]  of the bathtub or with the shower on but i think she's kind of losing her mind she's this hot chick  that everyone was was just infatuated with just a few years ago and now she's loony fat girl i think  she's uh taking a page out of uh paris hilton's book they started hanging out together and she notices  that paris is famous for doing nothing for doing just for and they even were hanging out together 
[01:39:30]  and she's like you know what this is this is kind of fun to to just do stupid things in public and  have everybody talk about you and no one's really talking about me lately i don't need paris anymore  she kind of taught me a few tricks here she taught me the old oopsie shot that we discussed from time  to time and i think she went out on her own and said look i i i get this game now and i'm gonna really  really have fun with it i'm not gonna have a record coming out anytime because she doesn't  need to look pretty anytime soon so she's like you know what i'm gonna really shock people i'm gonna 
[01:40:00]  i'm gonna do what paris has been doing for years and lindsey lohan has been doing for years and i'm  gonna really show you what this game is all about well it's working she's getting press i really do  because now she's like walking around in a blonde wig and and and and no one can control her it's a bad  blonde wig it's a yeah a bad blonde wig i mean she could obviously got something that looked a  little little nicer than this a little more natural yeah and now she's hanging out in a  karaoke bar in a booth by herself i was reading this morning yeah no one noticed her no one will hang 
[01:40:30]  out with her because she's crazy girl britney uh she must be stopped now she's finally done it  britney has oh there's the wrong article oh well where was she hanging out in hollywood yeah in hollywood  she went into a place that was doing karaoke she got a booth by herself and and no one cared  and matter of fact they even said that no one noticed to the point that someone was even doing  a britney spears karaoke song and and they didn't even know that britney was in the joint did she get  up and sing no no i think she's playing us i really do i think i think she's playing us us the the public 
[01:41:00]  the public the consuming public that loves eating this crap up joe public i was going through the uh  channels last night and uh you just couldn't get away from the inside edition extra you go through  the channels at a certain time of day and uh it's just from two to like channel 20 yeah it's just all 
[01:41:30]  those shows boom boom boom one after the other and it's the same thing my favorite is the insider  into entertainment tonight it's one big commercial for the show you're watching  that segs into the next show that is exactly what you just saw and they make believe you didn't see  the insider yeah and they never get anything done the big thing was um the uh what is it anna  cole's embalming exclusive and i saw that i was like what did i what and yeah they were they had 
[01:42:00]  an exclusive uh they were talking about anna nicole finally being embalmed she's just been in a  freezer since she died they froze her and now they finally let her be embalmed 20 degrees by the way 20  i believe it was 20 degrees that's all so she she was all like uh carbone just completely frozen yeah did  pat o'brien talk to her i just want to f you i would me you betsy the mortician betsy uh icebreaker 
[01:42:30]  ice pick if this turns you on just lay there and rot  and in a kill smith we'll be talking about how they defrosted her and involved her in this exclusive  interview with her even though she's dead yeah we're the only one that has the exclusive interview  with the corpse with the corpse and in a kill smith's mom will be joining us for an exclusive 
[01:43:00]  it's only a matter of time they interview the corpse and you just there's a hand they don't  even try to like fake it and the hand is moving the mouth just with some bed boy stub dried up prune  face and then you got that corner with the big freaking lump in his head have you seen i still  haven't seen him we found a better picture yesterday he has gumby head like the top it's  got a big goiter on his head i think it would be if you're looking at him the top left side of his 
[01:43:30]  head just pops way up he's got something going on is he smart maybe it's just his brain just squeezing  out it just needs more room it needs more room he's one of those real smart guys uh less than 48 hours  after snagging the world's attention by shaving off all her hair troubled pop tart britney spears  cut a pathetic figure sunday night when she crashed a stranger's party only to be left sitting alone  in a black leather booth by herself see i think that she's a little a little nutty you think she's  i i don't think she's the bodyguards everyone are following around like what is she gonna do next no 
[01:44:00]  one's stopping her that's no what are they gonna say she'll say no screw you i'm going out  they're talking about putting her in rehab and and she goes in for a day and then leaves or  something it's it's just dude when she was doing when she was shaving her head she was making sure  that she could be seen in the window at the paparazzi she started she kept looking at the cameras and  yeah that don't mean she's not not crazy if you're really going crazy you do this in your mansion by  yourself and then someone finds you and goes oh my god what the hell are you doing she's crazy but 
[01:44:30]  she's also yet doing it for attention because she's kind of crazy that's what i think yeah  she's an attention whore and she uh she can't get it can't get the attention she wants so she starts  uh doing doing the acting out she didn't have here's a problem she wants the sexy image she wants to  shed the whole mom thing but she doesn't have the guts just to bang on camera like paris hilton did  yeah there you go with a little oopsie just show it that'd do it you want right make a porno 
[01:45:00]  i mean that's the way you want to be sexy make a porno make a porno that'll be interesting how  it plays out i think there's uh some some tomfoolery going on a little tomfoolery  neil borks isn't talking about this today he's not he's shopping it's walt bounds  walt bounds i think he's a king colin  stupid walt bounds how do you even say it is a d silent i don't even know a d a b an l an m could 
[01:45:30]  you pick worse letters what was the x the z and the q taken all right uh tyra talking about her  pimple yes sam thought this wasn't important enough to bring to our attention but casually  mentioned it so we said you got to get this clip and man this is priceless so so the whole photo  shoot of her getting back into that bathing suit even though it's a different bathing suit it's a  larger version of the uh uh the original yeah uh that she wore on the cover 10 years ago she did 
[01:46:00]  a whole thing where she had a camcorder in the morning when she was waking up documenting her going  through the process of oh god how important is this that it just needs to be documented from  beginning to end as a huge moment in black history there's actually footage of her sleeping on the  airplane on the show that's great i only want to see that if she's sitting next to pain stewart 
[01:46:30]  and let me tell you it was very cold on that plane i want to see her sitting next to kenny and they  have to film her to trying to look all hot as she's sleeping with kenny next to her with his head lean  back his mouth agape he's the worst looking human when he sleeps oh big dumb face looking up at the  ceiling because he's so tall that his head goes over the headrest and just completely goes back 
[01:47:00]  like someone snapped his neck looks like saddam laying under the gallows his head is just snapped  back he's got no chin and his mouth is wide open he's snoring i gotta tell you guys come so  can he fix me up this morning and i knew it was coming i'm like oh god here he comes i i'm not even  in my seat yet i'm closing the door so what does this mean to you hear the news so what does the  merger mean to you guys you know this could be pretty bad for everyone and you know he was practicing 
[01:47:30]  all the way from jersey to manhattan how he's gonna ask how should i ask should i should i wait to he uh  turns up 10 10 wins like he does every morning or just hit it right away get it out of the way  maybe i should get it out of the way i'll do that because they're gonna want stern to do mornings  right he's not even i swear i'm i'm reaching for that so what does that mean to you guys 
[01:48:00]  what about the facility you broadcast from will there be a walkover so he was at least smart enough  to not like say merge or anything he he assumed that i knew at this point because sometimes he has to  state the obvious but this time it's just what does this mean to you guys because that's what's  important morning kenny door closed mel doesn't even like you guys yeah i know kenny actually i think  that was brought up of course it was yeah you know kenny is you know he holds a grudge does he 
[01:48:30]  nobody no i didn't think that kenny's a gossip he really is he's a gossip you know he's in  he's probably body probably in front of a uh a mirror just practicing how he's gonna talk to us  today should i do with my hands should i like thrust them out in front of me what do you think  i gotta be calm and a little bit sensitive i don't want to but i want to show concern i don't 
[01:49:00]  want to work anyone up here this is tough but i think they need me at this point they need me today  okay i think i got it let me get in the car all right now greg will get in the car you're screwed  maybe that was a little let me do this over no that was that was super agent bob eatman oh dooming  glue the harbinger of death he called me oh oh did he hear the news i don't know how bob did it 
[01:49:30]  but he flew to my house in in no time and i had to invite him in for him to be able to cross the  threshold and i saw no reflection in the mirror of him and then he delivered the news well this looks  very bad he's just the worst oh is he just the the worst i got some concerns do you do you have a  few concerns super agent bob eatman here's but here's bob's phone calls uh anthony hi how are you 
[01:50:00]  doing how are you doing doing fine bob doing good how are you doing oh oh this uh this merging i don't  know what this means for anyone involved we're gonna have to do some you know we're gonna have  to really think about what we want to do with this and and how we're gonna make what how about we just  sit and see how it plays out yeah plays out we can all just be dead tomorrow destruction everywhere 
[01:50:30]  plays out i'm a lawyer we don't let play lawyer this doesn't play out we got a plan in advance for  these things he actually said to me you know you you gotta get those ratings up so we have options  do we wow we were hoping we could just make them plummet  and a lot of listeners don't know who bob is if you don't know who he is  he was actually in the original omen he poked a lady's eyes out 
[01:51:00]  it kind of looks like the old creep that uh walked up to the screen door and pulled the guys as well  you're all gonna die we are that was kenny this morning he's just reaching for the door handle  duh what does this mean to you guys i was on the road with him probably about a couple about two  months ago i had a bad show not a bomb show but just not a good show i wasn't happy with my show  very small crap whatever it was aww it happens aww and uh i'm in a foul mood in the in the dressing room 
[01:51:30]  and the first thing he says we hardly sold any merch oh that's that's what you want to hear  i'm like you you could probably figure that out yourself i don't blame them i wouldn't have bought  it either after that performance what's the matter with you he loves stating the obvious when he sold  any merch merch it's okay you're amazing you took cancer news and made it worse how did you do that  i think there might be some payback involved here oh thanks kenny that's what i needed this morning 
[01:52:00]  at whatever it was 455 if you told kenny you had cancer he'd tell you how far the wig shop has moved  way out of the way now they don't even make them in your color  all right you want to hear pimple audio doctor said six months most people don't even make it that  long your insurance won't cover that doom and gloom just doom and gloomsters is what we have to deal 
[01:52:30]  with yeah yeah him and bob eatman should take a car ride together and then try clunk heads and make a  positive person i think we can do it yeah me too sure we can and then he he motivates me because  then halfway through the ride he goes you you know you guys are terrific thanks thanks kenny no really  you're terrific what input do you remember that as far as this whole merger goes were you in the meeting 
[01:53:00]  ah we love him but jesus he a negative nelly he's when he's not beating you with a phone book he's  beating you with cliches  all right with the photoshop redundant rock we get it how long is this guy going to take a photoshop  lesson during the show we understand we will do it we will get it done all right uh do we have time 
[01:53:30]  to play the shaking his head at me i saw your little hat move back and forth and i knew you weren't reading  all right here we go so uh let's play the tire clip here what the hell and in a little while we're  going to play what did we learn on the opian anthony show so sam uh she had a camcorder camcorder  recording her day as she got into that swimsuit for the first time in 10 years yeah followed her  and it was in her hotel room she had it positioned right by her bed because she couldn't sleep that  night she was so nervous so nervous uh nervous she's nervous because she's not sure if she's going to 
[01:54:00]  look hot boy that's that's a tough life i gotta tell you uh and then the voice you hear in this clip by  the way don't be confused it's tyra talking to herself because at first i was important because  i was confused i thought it might be like a producer or something coming in to wake her up no it's tyra  saying good morning to tyra and then looking in a mirror with the camcorder you know pointing at the  mirror as she discusses a pimple that's on her face tyra talking to tyra yeah yeah yeah there it is 
[01:54:30]  i shoot in a couple of hours i don't even know why i'm still awake why did i have to get this huge  pimple on my face right here so my pimple hi tyra how are you a couple 10 years ago didn't have a  pimple like that tyra well tyra you know there's retouching and there's makeup all right pimples  okay you know what this is not acting we gotta glimpse into what she really does when the 
[01:55:00]  this is what she does uh by the way good morning pimple thanks to um cigars and scotch yeah he did do  the photoshop he did and there it is can we get up on opianathlete.com i am looking at uh that she is  huge it's a giant now could you explain once again for everybody because you know we got a different  audience at this point at the sports illustrated uh swimsuit edition that she was on there 10 years  ago uh shows her looking all hot and she recreated it uh for the 10th anniversary but you could tell 
[01:55:30]  she's smaller in the picture than she was in the original you could tell because the sports illustrated  lettering doesn't match up uh her top of her head is uh in the picture a good inch below her crotch line  is in the picture when in the original it's a quarter an inch and the top of her head's cut off  so she pushed herself back in the picture to look smaller what cigars and scotch did was bring her back 
[01:56:00]  into perspective in the same uh uh scale as the original picture can he put them one by the other  he's got the two and one below he put them next to each other cigars and scotch if you could please  thank you know what he should do like keep the original too like he has yeah and then take the uh  the the original and move that down so that it should be four pictures cigars and scotch if you  know what i mean show it how sports illustrated is showing the comparison and then we'll show what 
[01:56:30]  it really should look look like in the second uh set of pictures she's giant this should go on  opianthony.com this should be sent to the media all over the place they'll pick up on this shot her face  got fatter her face got fatter her hips are huge and this is all done like to scale now look the  the crotch level to the bottom of the magazine is the same and her head the same amount of head is  cut off and she's not doing that little sexy hip thing that she's doing in the original when she was 
[01:57:00]  free and young and limber and human-sized she's standing there and actually our hands are are in  her bikini like she's got her thumbs locked in the sides of her bikini and in the original it's  kind of back further her right hand and her left hand is a little forward this one she's just covering  up hips that are sticking out with her hands do you know what it looks like when you look at the  new comparison it looks like the original compared to the new one it looks like uh a sam standing next 
[01:57:30]  to steve now this by the way he's got adjusted slightly by the way i think the one he did do  is a little bigger than it it should be oh you're sure yeah he's got to shrink it just slightly it's  not going to take away from what we have noticed just slightly let me see the s in sports yeah yeah  okay just there's a little piece of the letter p from sports that has to stick out from her head a  little bit god we perfect she's got to move over to the right a bit you gotta move her over a little 
[01:58:00]  bit yeah just make sure the the heads uh are the same side line up the shoulder with the t and  illustrated that much fatter the u's got to show a little more yeah there's a little tweaking he did  it a little tweaking but it you know it's a good example of of this and again this is not good who cares  that she got bigger really who cares that she got fatter but she's making such a big deal out of  this and that she looks you know uh she wants to show that she looks just as hot and uh we just like 
[01:58:30]  to show what uh full of crap she is what her body really looks like today 10 years later all right uh  when we get back we'll play what did we learn on the opening anthony show we had more on the pimple  but then you got distracted with the phone i got so distracted i want to hear the pimple talk again  or do you know we played it yeah i i know i was looking at this all right all right i'll hear it  on the replay all right no we'll we'll play it again real fast and we'll get into what did we  learn and and uh we'll kind of like mop up a couple uh other things we need to talk about today

[01:59:30]  good morning we're getting ready to play uh what did we learn on the opian anthony show today  uh here in new york we do live reads you know i don't know i think the rest of the country some  places hear us do live reads from time to time yeah but uh we were live in new york during the  commercial break aunt was trying to do a live read for amco and i'm laughing historically in the  background we're obsessed with tyra some people say we're more obsessed with tyra than tyra is obsessed 
[02:00:00]  with herself by the way and uh we're looking at the uh the swimsuit uh cover she did 10 years ago and  she uh redid it what last week or a couple weeks ago and we're noticing that if you really adjust  the shots where they should be that she's a lot lot bigger yep uh than she was 10 years ago and this  says it all uh used lead uh bag from whack bag yep biggest laugh i got from a listener today he 
[02:00:30]  writes oh my god look at all the extra polka dots yeah that alone why did we notice you want to go  through that real fast and please you got the pictures in front of you she's uh got her sports  illustrated picture from 10 years ago one from now she's doing a comparison saying she you know  looks still looks hot yeah it's all about her and she's wearing the same little pink polka dot a  bikini but it's not quite the same is it uh there are a lot more polka dots in the new one well she's 
[02:01:00]  kind of on the old one she was saying that this is the original suit that they just added some material  to it or the the original design i don't know whatever but uh but man there are a lot more polka  polka dots i'm looking at the bottom it's like one two three four five six seven on the bottom  was the original was the original okay and the new ones one two three three four five six seven  eight nine possibly ten i'm looking behind nine and two halves yeah you can make it to ten possibly 
[02:01:30]  and the boobs we got on this one it's one two three on the right boob okay and here it's one two three  four five six seven maybe eight on the bottom that's gonna make me laugh all day and also the color  if you notice the color of this new one is very bright pink and the bright white i really think  it's a distracting color like is there any way cigars and scotch can take the old suit and put it on 
[02:02:00]  the new picture with those muted colors color color corrected yes but we're asking him for a lot of work  today well we'd like that done well yeah well he can photoshop done more boob and stuff anyway uh  darken it up anthony you said you uh barely barely were listening to the pimple clip yes well  she was getting ready for the shoot and she had got the camcorder to record her day she wakes up in  the morning and like i said uh i thought it was a producer waking her up but it's tyra talking to tyra 
[02:02:30]  right through the camera and talking about this pimple here it is again i shoot in a couple of hours i  don't even know why i don't even know why i'm still awake why did i have to get this huge pimple on my  face right here good morning pimple hi tyra how are you a couple of years ago didn't have a pimple like  that tyra well tyra you know there's retouching and there's makeup all right pimple 
[02:03:00]  good morning mr pimple  want some breakfast mr pimple  good morning  she's talking to her pimple yeah hi jerry hi pimpley  the secret word is pimple  hello mr cellulite  hello roly hello mr polka dot a bikini 
[02:03:30]  hello roles  she woke up and discovered a pimple do you think the parents of children like six-year-olds with  cancer feel bad for her care about her pimple well if you asked tyra she would say i hope they do  i hope they do feel bad yeah i can't believe i woke up with this pimple oh my god this is awful  there's some kid no hair left on his head on a respirator with parents crying she's inspiring 
[02:04:00]  him someday you too can wear a wig made out of the hair of a horse's tail  there you go why are we so obsessed with her because it's just fun i know how ridiculous she is  she's obsessed she's awful in a mind-boggling way she's awful in a way i mean including hitler  and napoleon i've never seen him more awful than her yeah let's make it all good here though guys 
[02:04:30]  okay i was only joking see i was only joking i was only joking yeah i was only joking that's the  new one around the house all day long i was only joking oh oh what oh yeah  one of the all-time greatest taserings by the way yeah jimmy said to remind us  about your girlfriend and what she says oh god the uh after she uh services jimmy yeah oh 
[02:05:00]  i don't know if i can say i'll have to say this gently you have to see she performs treats yes  yes um and she's a good girl look no mess um right she'll go does my breath smell like  and blow her awful breath in my face 
[02:05:30]  i cut it out and she's like well just tell me if it smells like  oh my god is your girl hysterical oh she tortures me with it right in my stupid face she blows it  there's nothing nature put that scent in a man it's nothing like it on earth  it's horrid let's go to mike something wrong with her let's go to mike in jersey mike what's up  hey what's up guys how you doing today we're doing all right mike good uh i gotta be honest 
[02:06:00]  with you i'm a howard fan uh but i gotta tell you today he took another did i say another another  came off so i switched over to you guys and uh uh you guys never lost to magic man uh i used to  listen to you back on any w and uh uh i'm sorry that i switched away from you but i'm back with you  guys now man hey thanks mike can you tell mel uh that we haven't missed a step because uh we're  gonna need the help thank you mike our buddy mel yeah all hell is breaking loose today obviously 
[02:06:30]  they're all talking about this merger between the two satellite radio companies and and and  mr dope uh takes another day off another day a whole week a whole week he gets something like 16  weeks of vacation a year you would think the guy would go you know what this is kind of important  maybe i should be on the air for my listeners today what a jerk  taking the whole week off what a jerk well opie some people need to relax i don't understand where 
[02:07:00]  the hostility it just shows you where his brain's at i works hard why shouldn't he have some days  off is what i say let the guy take as many days as he wants just shows where he's at in his career  who are you kidding he doesn't give a crap about any of this i think a man of his uh passion years  ago seniority and radio and talent i think should be able to take off whenever he wants gonna have  a double wedding with his uh with his uh with his uh with his daughter they both got engaged at the 
[02:07:30]  same time that's just creepy gonna get matching poodle wigs for the wedding  his and her poodle wigs one for me one for my daughter  that's right stern's daughter got engaged as well that was opie talking here's what i have to say  i was only joking it was only i was only joking and this is me talking tip my fat  see they gave you the eroc clip but i trump you every time go ahead go ahead try me try me i like the 
[02:08:00]  eroc clip hello exactly sometimes i'm a bad boy yeah anyway so i was only joking there's your hero  he's not even on the radio for his fans today what a joke uh dan in east meadow what's up dan how's it 
[02:08:30]  going guys hey um today i learned that shirley chisholm doesn't mean anything to black women in  the history shirley chisholm oh chisholm yeah yeah yeah chisholm oh yeah my girlfriend's breast  smells like chisholm sometimes let's go to carterette where the hell is carterette carterette  jersey jersey yeah kevin what's up hey bubble boys hi i learned two things today yes for one  mel carmaison sounds just like kramer mel carmaison amazing all right and for another anthony might do

[02:10:00]  it's the opian anthony show  so 
[02:10:30]  uh  guitar solo 
[02:11:00]  guitar solo 
[02:11:30]  guitar solo 
[02:12:00]  guitar solo 
[02:12:30]  guitar solo 
[02:13:00]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. Creeps, ankle biters. 
[02:13:30]  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. 
[02:14:00]  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep.  Yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm gay.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  Press conferences online now.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:14:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's.  What the fuck is going on?  Oh, you're cursed.  We kept calm for the first three hours.  What the fuck is going on with our careers?  Oh, my God.  Help me.  What do we do?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I've seen awful things over the years. 
[02:15:00]  I've seen awful things.  I wish I could get all those awful things back.  People who wanted to subscribe to Sirius, but we didn't have the portable product to satisfy them.  And when we came out with a portable product, we found that we got new subscribers.  Our research indicates that there are an awful lot of people out there who like the content that we want.  God damn it.  And also like the content that XM offers. 
[02:15:30]  And the thought of them having two radios is not as attractive to them.  Right.  If, in fact, there was a product out there that could get both content.  So we think that there is a market.  You know, we've said this many times that our business model doesn't work by us taking subscribers from XM.  They don't have enough subscribers for us to take from.  Whereas the vast majority of the subscribers we're looking to gain are the 90% of the people who are currently not subscribers to satellite radio. 
[02:16:00]  Very good, boss.  The market that we're targeting, and that's the market that we believe that our combined terrific content and devices will make us more competitive with the alternatives that are out there that are competing with us, mainly for free.  Thank you.  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Craft with Credit Suisse.  Please proceed. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you.  How will you manage the transition from two networks to a single platform?  What's the integration path for the networks and also for the radios, particularly on the OEM side for the radios?  I'll take this one.  I'll field this.  The fact is, each company has millions of existing radios that are in cars and in consumers' hands.  What do we do?  Throw them away?  Both sets of technologies and both platforms.  Flush them down the toilet and go fuck our mothers?  For an extensive period. 
[02:17:00]  So, you know, that part, all of our customers and partners should have great comfort in.  But also, what we do understand is, you know, as you're aware from the task force of interoperability that we've had ongoing, we have joint engineering teams working hard to try to develop radios that would, in fact, be capable of accessing the full range of content from both systems and both architectures.  Wireless.  And as we begin to roll those out and make those more commercially viable, which we would certainly be able to do far more effectively as a combined company, then you're able to access the total portfolio of programming. 
[02:17:30]  And you gain a lot more flexibility through that process by doing it.  Now, are there other synergies and improvements and CapEx savings that we can make actually back into the satellite architectures and the combined terrestrial network?  Absolutely.  The sparing capabilities and the ability to overlay the repeater networks nicely, I think, are somewhat longer-term CapEx savings as we go throughout. 
[02:18:00]  But that's the general migration or transition-type plan that you would see.  And if I could just follow up.  Follow up.  Stupid follow-up.  He talked about offering a much broader array of content, you know, by combining this back term and being able to eliminate some of the redundant channels.  At what point in time do you think you can do that?  Because I think, you know, you've got to get, you know, the vast majority of your customers on to the radios with the dual-chip sets before you can do that. 
[02:18:30]  Is that about EROC?  I think there's all kinds of opportunities in the interim period.  So let's assume that we had a conversation with one of our content partners that was exclusive and that the merger has now occurred.  And that we believe that we want to expose that content to a wider audience.  Right.  And if it's in XM's interest to want to have that content, then we would be able to change that deal from an exclusive to where it's a shared content so that someone who's driving in a General Motors vehicle or driving in a Ford vehicle will be able to access that content. 
[02:19:00]  So it really doesn't require just that chipset.  We can do these things in advance through negotiation with our content partners.  So we'd be simulcast on both XM202 and on the Sirius channel, wherever the hell that would be.  Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Jacoby with Bank of America Securities. 
[02:19:30]  Please proceed.  Yeah, my question is for Mel Karmonson.  When it comes to Opie and Anthony, are you still holding a grudge?  Everyone knows back in 2002 they got fired for their Sex for Sam stunt.  A second question is, from a technology standpoint, to use both spectrums, are you going to have to launch new satellites to broadcast across the entire 25 megahertz?  My understanding is satellites don't have enough power. 
[02:20:00]  And then lastly, have you thought about the concern with the NAB perhaps on a congressional issue?  They reintroduced H.R. 983 last week.  H.R. 983-5, you dummy.  ...to bring Congress involved into the mix here in terms of looking at transactions.  He's actually wrong.  Let me start off on the thing.  First off, on the interim operation, Jonathan, let's be very clear about this.  We have had excellent antitrust and regulatory advice from our council. 
[02:20:30]  And until this merger is consummated and closed, both companies will continue to operate as we do today in the normal course.  Not a sloppy party body.  Bottom body.  Great flexibility for both of us to continue to execute on our plan.  So look for no changes on that particular front.  On the new satellites front, if you were simply trying to move to an architecture where a single satellite spanned both sets or a single constellation spanned both sets, that's much further out. 
[02:21:00]  But you do have the ability to integrate the two different systems together at the chipset level.  If you can, you know, it takes a little bit of additional development, as you know.  We've been working on those for a good period of time.  And certain of our satellites do have the capability of going across both sets of spectrums.  So we believe there could be near-term CapEx savings associated with that. 
[02:21:30]  And let me let Mel hit some of the NAB congressional.  Well, on the subject of congressional issues, we have obviously reached out in the last 12 hours or so to some of the members to talk to them about why this merger is in the best interest of their constituents.  Reached out to me.  I told them, you go ahead with us this week.  You got all my confidence and my blessing.  The market opens in eight minutes.  And lay out why this merger is a great merger for the consumer. 
[02:22:00]  You know, regarding any lobby organization's efforts.  All I can say is the fact that, you know, and I don't want to dwell on the NAB, but, you know, terrestrial radio has been saying for all of these years, and I go back to when I started funding it in 1990, the lobbying efforts on the part of the NAB against satellite radio.  And all of what they were saying is, you know, satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio. 
[02:22:30]  Gee, you know, they have different standards.  We're competitors.  And now what they're saying is that satellite radio is a monopoly, you know, if the two companies combine.  So, you know, I think that on the Pickering bill, you know, that obviously, you know, we, you know, have a viewpoint that we are currently not in, you know, we're not using our local repeaters, you know, for any local programming.  We certainly believe that we should be allowed, because the American public wants us to be allowed, to broadcast the Yankee games on XM or to broadcast the Giants on Sirius. 
[02:23:00]  And, you know, the NAB is saying that that's local content.  And, you know, we're saying we're broadcasting it on a national footprint.  We're not into the local advertising market.  National Association of Broadcasters, NAB.  And, again, you know, our belief is that we have the winning size of the rational argument.  They don't smoke a lot of cigars.  They don't want this merger to go down.  NAB has sort of been doing an aggressive job in sort of putting down everything that's competitive to them rather than selling their own proposition. 
[02:23:30]  Terrestrial radio stinks after 9 o'clock anyway.  Just quickly as a follow-up in terms of the model.  Think about NAB.  But then it gets better again when Ron and Chris come on.  Think about NAB and what it's called backwards.  Why don't we give you that number offline so we'll have someone from the investor relations call you at the end of this call.  Great.  Thank you.  Your next question comes on the line of Tom Watts with Cohen & Company.  Please proceed.  Cohen & Company.  Again, congratulations, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Here's a quick question. 
[02:24:00]  One, does the merger or establishing interoperability between the systems change any provisions in your OEM royalty agreement?  Or is there an opportunity to renegotiate some of those royalty arrangements?  And second, given some of the planned satellite launches by both companies, will this affect that satellite launch schedule?  Or are there any opportunities to incorporate different capabilities into those satellites?  So, firstly, in the case of Sirius, we have announced that we are going to launch Sirius V in 2008. 
[02:24:30]  And this transaction is not in any way.  I'm going to be on it.  I'm broadcasting from space.  First person ever.  I want to call and ask, will the old Sirius units be donated in New Orleans as housing?  We're committed to that.  For people who are displaced by Katrina.  We're being bought up by FEMA as new trailers.  OEM, you know, both companies believe in honoring agreements, not, you know, in breaking agreements.  We have no interest in doing anything that's inconsistent with any of our OEM agreements. 
[02:25:00]  And so on the subject of interoperability, radios, that if the car companies believe that it was in the best interest of their drivers and that they want to be able to have us do that, we would be wide open and open to do it.  You know, in the meantime, we would move ahead, you know, first rate on retail.  You know, we think that retail is looking for new products.  We think that one of the big drivers of demand for satellite radio at retail will be an interoperable or next generation product. 
[02:25:30]  And, you know, once we get the regulatory approval, we can sort of look to get that quick to market.  Hey, and Tom, I'll amplify those comments as well, too.  I mean, that's exactly what we believe.  Of course, because it's all got to be equal.  Of course, because it's all got to be equal.  You know, our OEM partners and the new car makers.  Well, I'll answer the other half to show the unity.  Even though we really probably just hate each other.  Right.  Whose cock is bigger, you think? 
[02:26:00]  Mel.  I give Mel the big cock.  Mel's got the bigger cock.  Yeah, sorry, Gary.  I don't know, Posh is probably his better girth.  No, I picture Mel having a big, fat, tan one.  At least Gary will look you in the eye as he fucks you.  Nothing in this transaction changes or modifies the plans that we would have on the Constellation.  And that's why we talked about the two types of synergies.  You know, there is the synergies that we know we can get to immediately upon closing. 
[02:26:30]  And then there is really, unlike a lot of other types of transactions, you know, there is those synergies.  And then there becomes this longer-term opportunity to get another bite at the bullet of synergies as we get into future constellations and repeater networks.  Yeah, definitely.  Thanks very much.  Next question.  Come on.  Our next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with J.P. Morgan.  J.P. Crockett.  Oh, here we go.  Okay, great.  Thank you for taking the question.  I wanted to ask a question about pricing. 
[02:27:00]  And the question is really this.  Do you have a question?  Yes.  I'd like to know, will pedophilia have a place in the merger?  Do we finally get our pedophilia channel?  We're talking about customers.  You know, there's substitution and less distinct.  You know, you guys have talked about interesting reasons.  It's XM kids.  You know, XM did that a year ago. 
[02:27:30]  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the pricing analysis, you know, playing out in terms of being supportive of your antitrust argument.  Uh-oh, this just in from Chris from Dallas.  The Florida Orange Harvest Report is about to come in.  Oh.  Thank you.  Thanks, Barton.  Sal Winthrop.  The market is about to open.  It's been a while on that time frame.  But the one thing that we do know, I mean, this is directly to your other question. 
[02:28:00]  You know, clearly, it's the combination of pricing.  This coming in from John in Wilmington.  Synergy is for careers.  So quickly, you grow your subscriber base.  And then Greg from Long Island.  Synergy.  Ways for the company to make more money and screw the customers.  On an ongoing basis.  Raising our prices diminished our conversion rate on some front.  So that is a situation that you're clearly cognizant of.  Yeah, I was discussing that with Gary the other day.  It's been confirmed.  Well, I told Mel to mention city names.  I don't know if it makes sense. 
[02:28:30]  I'll just mention it.  Trust me.  He said do it.  Yeah, he gets it.  I like that in the car as a constraining factor on that that we look at on a daily basis.  And frankly, that we've been looking at in our own pricing philosophies prior to the discussions of this.  You know, we're right.  You know, we're only listening in to hear our own names.  When I say we, they're going to throw in Norton out.  Come on.  It would be funny if Gary said, Opie and Anthony and Mel said, don't forget Norton and not E-Rock.  E-Rodundant. 
[02:29:00]  E-Rodundant.  What we're trying to do is to get more subscribers, not to just be...  Look at all the redundants walking out there.  10% of the population that we currently have as subscribers.  Dead men walking.  Oh, redundant.  Redundant.  Dead men walking.  At least you guys can wave.  Have not yet subscribed.  I think Mel's going to want to pay all these people for one fucking lousy show.  You know, our feeling is that unlike if you think about Dish and DirecTV, because that was brought up over the last few hours by some people, that this is totally unlike that. 
[02:29:30]  A lot of Trading Places quotes coming in.  Waterboro, we're ruined!  Is not watching it over the air with rabbit ears, but they're getting their television.  How's Pork Bellies doing today, Ed?  Or Satellite.  So the market really is our job pay services.  Here, in our case, the vast majority, over 90% of the people, are getting their radio over the air.  And which clock is right.  And for free. 
[02:30:00]  And that will be a restraint on satellite radio's overall ability to raise prices.  And we're confident that, you know, the Justice Department will see that when they look at all of our, you know, competitors.  Okay, great.  And then, though, in terms of your business, you have in the past, I think, been interested, Mel, in, you know, the potential for raising prices.  Obviously, it hasn't happened.  You know, when we look at the ARPU line over time with the combined company, you know, should we assume that there's potential for, you know, price hikes or ARPU growth from some other measure? 
[02:30:30]  I noticed you talked about all that.  Well, we're not looking at that in the near future.  Sure, so I think that you ought to assume that the ARPU numbers that will increase in the futures, in part because of additional services.  So, you know, we're going to be introducing video, and XM has a bunch of navigation and marine and weather.  We also believe that the advertising line is going to contribute, you know, significantly in the future toward ARPU. 
[02:31:00]  I don't have a fan, but I'm so funny.  You know, regarding pricing opportunities that could exist over time.  Those will have to be visited as we take a look and see how robust, you know, the satellite radio market is and whether or not, you know, what our cost structure is and what the consumer is willing to pay.  We don't want to do anything today.  So let's forget this merger for a second.  We don't want to do anything today at Sirius that's going to slow down the adoption of more people coming to satellite radio. 
[02:31:30]  So the reason that we have not raised our price isn't necessarily related to XM at all, okay?  No.  You can argue that may be related to XM.  We could have done a price increase, but that's not our competitor.  The issue for us is the reason that we have not raised the prices when there were two companies is because of that overwhelming market out there of people who are not paying for radio who haven't yet adopted it. 
[02:32:00]  What?  Okay, great.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, that guy didn't get his answer.  He's all confused.  That guy was a douche.  DJ Jantz with Lehman Brothers.  Please proceed.  Thank you.  Yes, I wanted to know, the rumors are that you fully intend to squeeze the Jews out of the equation.  Is that true?  You know, given the opportunity to expand your offering on audio, does it really matter that you need both the 12.5 MHz or, you know, if it comes down to getting the fuel, you could give us 12.5 MHz. 
[02:32:30]  The volume is almost 45 million shares up, Sirius is up 9.73%.  Well, first off, I mean, obviously, I think the folks that have studied this, those license awards were a decade ago, and those were the determinations.  Up to $4.06 a share.  By the way, that rule is not like a congressional rule.  It simply was part of the life.  Don't look like I'm selling today.  I put in a buy order to buy at $80. 
[02:33:00]  It is not practical to buy, Sirius is at $80.  Why would you buy at $80?  Jimmy knows what he's doing.  Because I'm a stock expert, stupid.  Yeah, don't have to sell.  I'm a stockologist.  ...feasible alternative.  You have millions and millions of radios out there on each one.  It's a bull market for NASDAQ.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  XM up $2.29.  Of course it is.  To $16.27. 
[02:33:30]  Up 16.38% on 16,650,000 shares.  Buy at $49.  What are you talking about?  By the way, we know where Elo's been.  You've been asking a question for a while.  ...serve that very large existing customer base.  But Gary, assuming you're simply as firing on that spectrum, because I don't really think  anybody's going to develop a new satellite radio venture, given you guys have locked up.  Why isn't Sirius going up faster? 
[02:34:00]  I don't own XM.  I buy XM at $49.  I buy Sirius at $80.  I don't compromise with no one.  You fucking guys play the little child's games you play with stock.  What do you sell at?  I sell at $4,000.  Across the board.  $4,000 I sell.  They have a radio in that that can only pick up Sirius.  Oh, this is your question.  I cannot see it in the government's interest in not continuing to serve that consumer. 
[02:34:30]  Oh.  This is a follow-up.  All right.  What is the surviving platform?  Is it XM or Sirius?  AOL's helpline is calling.  Both.  Both survived.  Once again, just to make sure that this is crystal clear, I mean, we each have satellite  constellations that may have 15 or more years of lifetime within there, and millions and  millions of subscribers depended upon that satellite constellation.  It is simply not realistic or practical to look at the elimination of a platform. 
[02:35:00]  Ah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Your next question.  The last question sucked.  With RBC World Markets, please proceed.  Thanks.  Good morning.  One quick follow-up on the regulatory side.  Yeah.  I think people are pretty understanding of the argument that the market definition of mobile  audio entertainment is pretty broad from a DOJ perspective.  Of course.  I think what we could use a little more clarity on is the actual process by which you get the 
[02:35:30]  waiver from the FCC in terms of the limitations on the one license holder owning another.  Any more clarity you can give there?  So the way it'll work is that we will, within 20 days of signing, we will file our Hart Scott  Rodino, and that will trigger the activity at the Justice Department.  And you said that you sort of got an understanding of how that flows. 
[02:36:00]  Within 25 days, we've agreed that we're going to file an application with the FCC, and that will start the clock going at the FCC.  And ultimately, when we get down to it, it's going to be determined by the five commissioners voting as to whether or not the five commissioners believe that this merger is in the public interest.  And, you know, is the consumer going to get more choice and better pricing?  You know, we believe that the $26 that the consumer currently pays to be able to get the content from both services have the opportunity to be, you know, vastly improved. 
[02:36:30]  So we think that there are opportunities for the consumer to get better pricing and for them to have more choices.  And we will answer any questions that the FCC has on this issue of public interest.  And at the end of the day, the commissioners will vote and hopefully vote in favor of the merger. 
[02:37:00]  Will they?  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  I think we only have maybe one more question.  Ooh.  We have time for one last question.  Oh, come on, guys.  That question comes from the line of Lorraine Mancini with Lehman.  We're counting on an hour from you guys.  Less show for us to do.  Thanks.  A couple questions for you.  First of all, there's going to be a lot more serious shares in the market.  And now that you've got potentially much faster growing cash flow, how do you look at stock buybacks in the future?  You're in a combined company.  Also, how quickly do you think you can get the interoperable product in the market? 
[02:37:30]  And in line with that, what do you think the replacement cycle is for your current retail product?  Is it three years?  How long will it take once that's in the market for people to switch in their replacement?  So I like the question on free cash flow because I truly believe that free cash flow is what creates wealth, you know, for shareholders.  And this transaction would get us to, you know, have more significant free cash flow.  And, you know, when you start thinking about when you have this free cash flow, you know, what do you do with it? 
[02:38:00]  So, you know, you could pay down debt.  And that's certainly something that both companies, you know, will be very unleveraged at that point.  You can use it to make acquisitions.  And, you know, not sure what there would be out there in the way of acquisitions.  Or the third thing that you would use that free cash flow would be to buy back your stock.  And certainly that's something that we would have a great deal of interest since, you know, both management teams are fully vested along with, you know, the shareholders.  And, you know, on the point about products, you know, we're constantly coming out with new products. 
[02:38:30]  And, you know, what we think will happen is that there's a team in Boca Raton, many of you visited it, you know, in the past, to take a look at those people who are also working on the interoperable radio.  You know, there is an ability that we would have once we are together to figure out the way to market it and bring it into the consumer in as fast as an opportunity.  That's only cost me a buck.  Because that product truly is... 
[02:39:00]  Sell at 50 cents.  Sell everything at 50 cents.  You know, we would be anxious to bring it to market once we know that we have this, you know, regulatory group.  You got some calls then, Jimmy?  Yes.  And certainly on a combined basis, that is the real essence.  I do.  I just bought a thousand call options at a buck.  You got ripped off.  I bought 25,000 call options at $12.50 each.  Sell at 50 cents.  As elegantly as you can.  The range of consumers, buyers, and options would... 
[02:39:30]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!  That's hysterical!  You might be in trouble, Jimmy.  I'm not in trouble.  And it was like Elo and I discussed a few weeks ago, we were buying stock quietly under assumed names.  On a combined basis, we'll have every economic...  That's right.  Joe Smith bought some stock recently.  ...as possible, and the broadest portfolio of...  I hope Joe Smith did buy...  I hope Joe Smith was screwed.  ...and types of channels and pricing, but also from numbers of devices and types of devices that are out there as quickly as possible. 
[02:40:00]  So we know that we've given you an awful lot of material in a short period of time.  This is a wrap-up.  Good point, boss.  ...and we have a bunch of meetings that we really need to go to, so Gary and I are off.  But our crack investor relations teams are available to you, so if there's any questions you want, I'm sure they will all be responsive.  And on behalf of both of us, thank you for joining us today.  Thank you, boss.  Yes, thank you.  Thank you for your participation in today's conference.  This concludes the presentation... 
[02:40:30]  What are you wearing, lady?  ...and have a good day.  All right.  So is Mel and Gary together right now?  Yeah.  Where are they?  Together again.  In a bathhouse.  Are they wearing suits?  Well, today's range is a little middling now.  Now the conference is over now.  They settled back.  Yep, settled.  Stock went up.  Then some people bailed.  You know what it is, though?  It's a whole bunch of bull trader stuff going on.  There's bull trading.  It's a very bear market.  And please... 
[02:41:00]  Will you stop laughing?  We got an expert on the show.  I know what I'm talking about.  It's a bear market.  Jimmy, continue.  And stock has dipped a bit after an initial peak in a bull market.  NASDAQ.  NASDAQ.  What about options?  Please, who doesn't need them?  What are we, faggots?  Show me a man with no options.  I want to show you a man with two cocks in his mouth.  People are saying Boardroom Jimmy is their new favorite character. 
[02:41:30]  Bird from Philly.  Boardroom Jimmy.  Of course.  You heard the press conference.  Why don't you summarize for us here what you heard?  Bunch of bullshit, really.  It's just going to be a bunch of...  A couple of satellites are going to go up,  and what we're going to do is we're going to buy back all the options  and sell it $3.11.  End of discussion.  That's what cash flow is, as Mel and I have talked about before.  Boardroom Jimmy, yes.  I told him.  So is this a good deal for both companies? 
[02:42:00]  It certainly is not a good deal.  Why?  Because we need to make more satellite companies.  Dilute the market.  Boardroom Jimmy.  Boardroom Jimmy is scary.  Boardroom Jimmy understands that Free FM is the only way to make this work.  Stop charging people and ad commercials.  Boardroom Jimmy, you've got a lot of stockholders.  They're a bit nervous with this news of this merger. 
[02:42:30]  Well...  You've got to calm their fears here, sir.  There's no need to have any fear.  In a bear market, there's always going to be NASDAQ trading.  How many times does Mr. Parsons and Mel and I have to tell you that?  You know why boardroom Jimmy scares me?  He's very adamant and passionate about what he's talking about,  but it's nonsense.  It's not.  It makes perfect sense.  In a bear market, you might have a point,  but right now it's bull trader.  Excuse me, Hawk.  You're redundant.  Don't touch that. 
[02:43:00]  Hey, from West Orange, it's Jimmy wearing...  Boardroom Jimmy.  Is Jimmy wearing suspenders and a pinstripe suit?  Jimmy Gordon, Gecko, Norton.  That's right.  Sell.  I love boardroom Jimmy.  He's a total ass.  Boardroom Jimmy makes a lot of sense.  You sure do, boardroom Jimmy.  I certainly do.  And the only way to make this work is insider trading.  I've said that many times.  Give information to people and don't tell the public. 
[02:43:30]  What about the Monopoly?  Exactly.  It's a fine game and I'm going to have it in every break room for all of our employees.  This is never going to get FCC approval.  We don't need the FCC.  I say, fuck them.  We do what we want.  We don't go to...  Boardroom Jimmy, we've got a lot of questions coming in.  We've got some dude.  He wants to know, what about the synergy and the bottom line?  Synergy is for faggots. 
[02:44:00]  And the bottom line is what...  I don't get involved in the bottom line.  Sell it $1.50.  The bottom line is what Eric Logan is laying under after a night of drinking.  Alright, I don't think we have any more questions for boardroom Jimmy.  Nah, boardroom Jimmy's hungry.  I think we've covered it.  But, you know, we're going to have to keep the new character because there's going to be a lot of questions. 
[02:44:30]  I'll be happy to answer any of them.  Alright.  Someone is saying, get Jimmy a monocle.  A monocle and one of those oldie time tickers.  The big glass globe that the ticker tape comes out of.  Nah, he needs a pocket watch.  Boardroom Jimmy, would you like a pocket watch?  I don't care what you get me.  Because the S&C 500 is exactly what I'm trying to say.  The S&C 500. 
[02:45:00]  What about blue chip stocks?  I don't believe in blue chip stocks.  Sell everything.  Are you more a penny stock guy?  Huh?  Penny stock?  No.  I just buy options.  Right.  3,000 options at $40 per.  And then sell.  You realize the stocks would have to be about $4,000.  Of course they would be.  Who wouldn't know that?  Someone wants to know, boardroom Jimmy, can you explain the difference between NASDAQ and the Dow?  I certainly can, but I choose not to. 
[02:45:30]  That would be insider trading.  That's insider trading.  The Dow.  Who doesn't?  The Dow is irrelevant.  It's falling by the wayside.  The Dow is irrelevant.  The Dow.  That's the way blacks deal with the Dow.  White people, we stay with NASDAQ.  Oh, God.  How about the ticker?  We got a lot of newbies out there.  What are they looking for when they read the ticker?  They're trying to find stock pricing. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Now, what would you do in this situation?  You got serious.  What is this?  It's, you know, you could buy options now for pretty cheap.  Do you buy put options or call options?  Yes.  See, do you think the price is going up, you buy some calls, or you think it's going to go down, then you buy some put options.  The options right now, you don't buy now, stupid. 
[02:46:30]  You wait until the options go up, and then you buy when they're more valuable.  But it's all relative.  Hey, of course it's all relative.  If you bought call options now, and if the price goes up, then they're worth more, and you sell them and make some money.  Yeah, but right here it just says that interest rates have been fluctuating for some time.  Where did that come from?  Of course.  Someone from New York, pair boardroom Jimmy with the money, honey.  It'll be the money, honey, and the money, dummy.  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Well, I've been in this discussion before.  The money, honey, is a cunt.  Wilson, for Christ's sakes, tell us.  My God.  We're ruined.  This is one of my favorites from the movie right here.  I want trade and reopen right now.  Get those brokers back in here.  Turn those machines back on.  Turn those machines back on.  That's the one who took Jimmy's advice.  We'll see who laughs last. 
[02:47:30]  I've got all the money in my corner.  All right.  I see you've got the market watch.  Of course I do.  I live for the market watch.  I wipe my Heidi with old editions of it.  All I read.  Jimmy wipes with the Wall Street Journal now.  Fun paper.  All right.  We're going to break.  All right.  We've got Heather Graham coming in.  We're promoting Grey Matters.  Limited release this Friday.  Is she here yet?  Limited release.  Oh, boy.  I love her.  Not yet. 
[02:48:00]  She has a make-out scene in that movie.  We were just watching it earlier.  She's got a good cast, too.  Iraq popped it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty cool.  And then she was in one of my favorite movies ever.  Roller Girl.  Bookie Nights.  Yep.  Bookie Nights.  And Austin Powers.  She was in that.  Is Boardroom Jimmy still in the room? 
[02:48:30]  Boardroom Jimmy is eating, but what's the question?  I'll see if I can give a simplistic, fast answer.  All right.  Well, Boardroom Jimmy.  How do I diversify my portfolio to compensate for the volatility of my satellite radio share?  There is no volatility.  Diversifying is for Jews and faggots.  I've said that many times.  Standard & Poor's 500 specifically says that. 
[02:49:00]  Boardroom Jimmy, how will this merger affect OPEC?  OPEC is non-existent anymore.  It's just a figurehead.  Please talk to me during a bear market about OPEC.  Here's what I say about OPEC and mergers.  That's what I say.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I love how it's bull and bear at the same time. 
[02:49:30]  Of course it is.  We both knew that.  That's great.  All right.  Diversify.  I think we've run this one into the ground.  We certainly have.  We're running out of steam in the boardroom.  Actually, no, we're not.  They're loving boardroom Jimmy.  Boardroom Jimmy.  That's the guy to listen to when you want to invest.  Everyone wants to get cheery with the Steve song.  Do we do that corner break? 
[02:50:00]  We could do that.  All right.  Let me find it.  We all got to get happy here.  We all got to relax.  We're in the middle of chaos here.  Chaos rules the world.  Where is Steve's song?  Where is the happy song?  Where could it be?  You had it on a sheet.  There it is.  There it is.  Good work, Dan.  You're not redundant.  No, Dan's going to be just fine.  You think?  Yeah.  I think everybody's blown out.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
[02:50:30]  Outro Music 
[02:51:00]  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  They're practicing being cruel and unusual.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, all right, all right. 
[02:51:30]  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Very, very busy day.  Chaos all around us.  We're loving the chaos.  We've got Heather Graham outside the studio.  She's making her way in to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  She just gave a look of, oh God, wish me luck.  No.  Oh, wow.  She's taking her coat off.  She looks great.  Oh my, wow.  Doesn't she? 
[02:52:00]  My God.  Here's where, oh.  Hi, Heather.  Hi, Heather.  Here's where we just, let me preface this by saying, here's where we just fall apart.  You should have left your coat off.  You should have left your coat off.  Here's where we just fall apart.  No, we are nice, but.  I'm glad that you liked that I took my coat off.  You look great.  Yeah.  That was really.  You're wearing a beautiful, off-the-shoulder little number.  It's wonderful.  I got to preface this by saying, we just fall apart when pretty girls come in here. 
[02:52:30]  Because it's usually.  There's a lot of boys in here.  It's all boys.  Look, isn't it?  Yeah.  It's depressing.  It's like messy boys.  It's messy.  Does it smell like gym socks in here?  No.  Is it awful?  No.  We tried to clean up.  It's so clean.  No, it's not right.  You did miss the trash can there, huh?  We should have cleaned up for you.  Jimmy's sandwich is there with a knife.  I moved this to the left, though.  I stopped eating.  You made a mess.  I have stuff in my teeth.  Heather Graham comes in.  I'm trying to smile and be.  Can you stop filming so aggressively? 
[02:53:00]  You're making me uncomfortable.  You're awful.  And you know what else Jimmy did?  He wears a Breathe Right strip because he has sinus trouble.  Oh, yes.  But he took it off just for you.  Wait.  I'm so honored.  Wait.  Can you breathe okay?  How are your sinuses doing?  They're all right.  They're not as good as they should be.  But I wanted a photo where at the end I can't have a Breathe Right strip.  I'm like an idiot.  I just can't have that.  I've done that with 20 other people that have come in.  Wait.  What is it?  So what does a Breathe Right strip do?  Does it really help?  It's like athlete's use.  I put it on my nose and I press it down and it actually opens your septum and helps you breathe  it right a little bit. 
[02:53:30]  It's the only thing athletic he would ever put on his body.  Yeah.  With the strip?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Not that I don't shower before work, of course.  I jump up and I shower.  Wait.  What time do you guys have to wake up?  Four.  Yeah, really?  That's terrible.  Yeah, it sucks.  How do you do that?  Do you go out at night?  No, we have no lives.  You have no lives.  It really sucks.  Like, we used to do afternoon drive radio, which was great.  Yeah, yeah.  If you can't be to work by three o'clock in the afternoon, you pretty much shouldn't have  a job.  Yeah.  But mornings, we got to get up at like four around there. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, my God.  What about you?  Big Hollywood actress.  What time?  Noon, right?  I like to get up at noon.  Noon.  But if I work on a job, I have to get up at four sometimes.  I picture big sprawling bed.  Oh, yeah.  Like, somebody knocks on your big double doors.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Excuse me, Miss Graham.  And then you're like, no, five more minutes.  No, no.  I like, okay, Sunday.  I like to really just try to stay in bed all day as much as possible.  Do you guys ever do this?  Yeah.  Just barely leave, like talk on the phone, go eat food, get back in bed.  That's it.  I think at least one or two on Sunday.  Do you order out or do you have food in your house? 
[02:54:30]  I have food in my house.  I cook.  You cook?  I'm a pretty good cook.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do you go back to bed with your makeup on?  I never, no.  I don't even wear, I'm only wearing this because I'm doing, I usually don't even wear that much  makeup at all.  Actually, you were on Regis.  How did that go?  I was just on.  It went good.  That was Regis.  Was he nice?  We got Heather Graham coming out here.  I love this girl.  She's always yelling at something, isn't he?  That's a good impersonation.  Thank you.  Can you do anyone else?  No.  That was really good.  I just do Regis all the time.  He does a few.  Come on. 
[02:55:00]  You got a Christopher Walken.  Everyone has that.  No, everyone does that.  That's like Jay Moore does that.  Okay.  Jay Moore does the Christopher Walken, but.  Did he show your pictures while you were on?  Well, he's all those baby pictures.  We just love that technique.  Oh, okay.  And I was supposed to bring one, but they were in LA, so I had to do it.  Baby pictures?  Is that his gag for the day?  That was the gag.  Yeah.  To bring your own baby pictures?  See, normally I'm sleeping, so I don't watch that joke because I'm asleep.  Yeah.  Well, most people watching it are asleep.  I'm not saying anything bad about Regis.  I'm saying his audience, usually.  It's kind of an older demo, I think. 
[02:55:30]  You're not good about Regis.  So what's your guys' demo?  Just the cool, the cool, groovy?  No, we only get the cool people.  Actually, fat people.  Oh, really?  You only want to attract those people.  Fat guys.  Fat guys.  Really?  That's pretty much it.  Hot.  Our whole eyes.  Is it like that bear magazine?  Like, are they bears?  They're bears.  Get our bear in here.  Yeah.  You know about that stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I guess doing Big United out of research.  I have a friend.  She's really into bears.  Really?  Yeah.  She's really into the bear.  Well, here comes a bear now.  Okay.  This is a bear who shaves his arms, though.  He's actually a hairier Lebanese fellow. 
[02:56:00]  He used to be a lot bigger.  But look how shiny he is.  What is he wiping his eye like an eight-year-old?  Yeah, what's in your eye?  Because I'm never, I'm never.  Is this on?  No, it's, of course.  Why would it be?  All right.  I don't think you're hairy enough to be a bear.  Well, I shaved my arms.  You guys have no hair.  He shaved them.  Hold on, Heather.  You've got to understand.  He shaved constantly.  Well, I can see the chest and the back.  Excuse me.  Look, look, look.  Okay, okay, okay.  Yes.  That'll do it.  And why am I wiping my eyes?  Because I've never brought in here for anything good.  I'm always brought in here to get the shit kicked out of me. 
[02:56:30]  Wait, is your back really hairy, too?  Showing your back.  I get it lasered.  Oh, really?  Lasered?  No, no.  Take your shirt off for it.  Or at least the back part.  Show the back.  Come on.  Don't be shy.  It's Heather Gray.  All right.  Well, okay.  It's a little hairy.  Yeah, but he's got pretty tatted up.  He could be a bear.  Got any tats?  No.  No, you didn't go for that whole thing?  Good.  I mean, that would be horrible.  You tattoo the name of someone you're with and then you break up and then it's tattooed  on your body forever?  Then you're stuck with it.  That'd be horrible.  I saw that.  Someone's got, oh, what's her name?  Denise Richards has Charlie tattooed on her ankle. 
[02:57:00]  I bet she just loves that washing her feet all the way.  What if you tattooed it on your butt and it was just on your butt?  That's another one.  And then you get another boyfriend or something like that and he's got to look at some other  guy's name on your ass as things are going on.  Then again, after you break up, you can just take the person's name and put an arrow right  to the middle of your ass.  Let's go.  Is, uh...  Well, you know, Johnny Depp, you know, I guess he did Winona.  He had Winona.  Yeah.  And you had to change to Wino, I think.  Wino.  Yeah.  That's good.  You'd rather have the Wino thing than even any recollection that he went out with her. 
[02:57:30]  Exactly.  He's got the last, like, letters.  I was actually surprised to read.  You were in a movie I loved.  It's been a year since I've seen it.  Six Degrees of Separation.  Oh, wow.  That was a long time ago.  Yeah, it was a really cool, like, Will Smith movie, which is, like, my favorite thing he's  ever done, because he played, like, a hustler who said he was Sidney Poitier's son.  It was, like, really a weird clip.  Oh, yeah.  It's from a play, actually.  Who were you in that?  Because I haven't seen it in probably five years.  Okay, well, do you remember, like, he's, like, a gay hustler?  Yeah.  Will Smith.  So, basically, he has sex with my boyfriend.  And I'm, like, we're aspiring actors, and we're living in this, like, small little part  when he comes to stay with us, and we become friends with him.  Oh, yeah.  And he's with my boyfriend.  I get very sad. 
[02:58:00]  Does he seduce the boyfriend or something?  Yeah, he seduces the boyfriend.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember that scene.  I remember that whole, look at him.  Did it turn you on?  No.  Is that why you love that movie?  No.  It only would have turned me on if you were yelling at the boyfriend and making him do  it.  Like, that would have been kind of hot.  He gets Heather Graham.  That's hot, yeah.  I'm not a couple.  He steals away Heather Graham's boyfriend.  Will Smith does.  How does he do that?  Did the boyfriend know?  I guess he takes it up the butt.  I guess I narrowed it down.  That pretty much would do it.  Way to bring the point home.  I would say a roofie would have to be involved. 
[02:58:30]  No, I think it was a very, it's all about how he's so seductive and he can get anyone  to do anything, right?  Yeah.  He's like the most very manipulative seductive.  And he kind of convinces like Stocker Channing and Donald Sutherland are the very liberal  New Yorkers who kind of like adopt him and it's really, it's good.  And there's a scene out in front of a theater in Washington Square Park in the village.  That's how I remember.  Yeah.  Really interesting point to raise.  You ass.  Way to take a good point and crash and burn with us.  We have Ryan in Chicago.  Ryan, we're talking to Heather Graham today. 
[02:59:00]  What do you got?  Hey, I remember four years ago, I think it was during your Austin Power stuff that you're  on Leno, I think it was.  Yeah.  I was what?  Yeah, you were driving and admitted to working yourself there while you were driving.  And I've done the same thing just thinking about that.  I've seen you in your magazines.  Wait, but you should be careful.  What if you get in an accident?  I'd be able.  I'd be working.  Well, what about you?  You were doing it.  Did you fess up to masturbating while you were driving? 
[02:59:30]  I think I might have tried.  I don't know.  Why did I say that on TV?  Why would you say that?  I don't know.  No, I had a friend.  She just looked and goes, I don't know.  Okay, this is what happened.  I had a friend and she was telling me how she would masturbate when she was driving and she  was talking about it.  She made it sound so good.  I'm like, I have to try this.  Give it a whirl, right?  I tried it.  But I have to say, it's not my favorite place for masturbation.  No, you can't concentrate.  There are more comfortable places to masturbate.  I think it's the kind of scary death.  It's your favorite place of a radio studio?  Radio studio.  I actually like watching guys masturbate in a radio studio. 
[03:00:00]  That's what I like.  You have walked into heaven.  You have hit the jackpot.  You have no idea who's sitting right next to you.  Do women really like that?  Because women say that they like that.  Do women really get off on that?  Or is it more like, I don't want to touch him?  So like, yeah.  Well, actually, I've read all these books on tantric sex because I think it's really  interesting.  And basically, there's this whole thing where you're supposed to masturbate in front of  each other.  And then it's very nice because you get to watch each other and see what the person likes.  It's like a live action movie.  It's hot.  Yeah.  I've done it.  Believe me, I've done it. 
[03:00:30]  I think it's kind of sexy.  I've never done it where she said, I want to watch you.  I've always done it where I've gotten a look like, what are you doing?  Like, what are you doing?  That's when she wakes up.  Well, did you have a picture of some other girl that you were looking at at the time?  That doesn't help either.  Yeah.  If you have a computer on your lap.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like, I'm trying to be tantric if she sees me in the shrubs and I'm running away.  Well, that's good.  You're very, you know, open with that.  That's really sexy.  Open with that.  Saying it on Leno.  Well, you guys asked me.  You're very open with it.  Well, we tried it. 
[03:01:00]  To be honest, I don't remember that, but I guess.  How fantastic were you in Boogie Night?  I mean, that was, it was amazing.  I mean, I like the sexy stuff, but I also like when you give that guy a good stomping.  Oh, yeah.  That was really fun.  That must have been nice.  Well, when you're like a girl, you know, when you, you don't get to like really beat people  up as much as you might want, you know, or like kick ass, you know?  So it was fun.  Were you hesitant?  Yeah, you were hammered up.  You were really angry and like scary.  Were you hesitant when they said, all right, like, I know Burt Reynolds was weird about  doing the movie.  Like, he kind of felt like he didn't want to do it and he kind of regretted it until 
[03:01:30]  he saw, I think, how great it was.  Did you kind of feel weird playing like a porn person or were you like, like, quit psyched  to do it before you did it?  Well, at the time I got, I don't think I, you know, at the time that I got that job,  I wasn't really working that much.  So I was, when I read the script, I actually thought it was a really good script.  So I was psyched, way, way psyched.  And I saw his other movie, which was amazing.  His first movie he did was called Hard Eight.  And I thought he was an amazing director.  So I was very, I mean, it sounded weird if you told people like I'm acting in this porno  movie.  In fact, I think I went on some radio show and I was actually K-Rock.  Do you remember how they had that, like, they'd have guests on that?  And they were like, because I actually was in the movie Swingers at the time. 
[03:02:00]  So they're like, well, what else are you doing?  I'm like, I'm doing a movie about porno actors.  And they just railed on me, like, railed on me so hard.  Like, you're doing a movie about porno actors.  So I'm like, what is that going to be?  And then basically later on, I think I saw him and he's like, I'm sorry I railed on you  about Boogie Nights because that movie turned out good.  It was really good.  Great film.  That scene where you're both doing coke and you're like, will you be my mom?  And it was just great.  My acting sucked.  I hate when I watch real actors do it.  And I'm like, maybe you should go and, are you an actor?  No.  I've acted, but I mean. 
[03:02:30]  He's an actor.  He's downplaying it.  I'm a comic, but I've done acting.  But he doesn't know what to do with his hands is the problem.  I never know what to do with my hands.  Like, when you're acting, it's like, what do you do with your hands?  And everyone tells him just naturally what you would do in life.  Like, what do you do?  Like, you make too many movies.  I'll either stand like Frankenstein with them stiff and not moving, or I just gesticulate  like three moments behind, like just widely and just really Shakespearean and horrible.  Well, maybe you need to write your own show for yourself and you could be like the weird  hand gesture guy.  Yeah.  Weird hand guy.  The robot-handed asshole. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a little movie.  It was called Spider-Man.  Yeah.  That Jimmy was in.  Oh, you were in it?  He was in it.  And we have his line.  Wait, who did you play?  I saw it.  We have his line right here, if you remember it.  This, let me set the scene.  Spider-Man had just kind of taken the town and was getting a lot of press.  And they were doing this montage of people that were commenting on what they think about  Spider-Man.  And he was billed as surly truck driver.  Wow.  And this was his line when asked what he thought about Spider-Man. 
[03:03:30]  He stinks and I don't like him.  Wow.  Thank you.  Wow.  That was Jimmy in the blockbuster movie Spider-Man.  Wait, I really believe that you were a surly truck driver.  And that he stunk and he didn't like him.  You should have seen me moving the box.  I mean, it was actually empty, but I made it look like it was full.  Why don't you like him?  No, I just, I'm acting for me.  I've done other stuff.  It's just like him.  Why don't you like Spider-Man?  Yeah, why didn't you like Spider-Man?  What is your motivation there?  What is wrong with Spider-Man?  I saved people and you're just loading truck as a miserable man.  Here's what I didn't like about it.  I was auditioning.  What's your backstory?  I mean, why didn't you like Spider-Man? 
[03:04:00]  What was your family like?  What is your personal life?  Don't think like an ass.  I didn't start thinking maybe they'll put me in the sequel to do the line again.  Believe me, I was such a pompous fool.  I'm like, maybe there's a part in part two for me.  But the interesting truck driver who was won over by Spider-Man.  I should be shot.  No, I was, I didn't want to audition for it.  I didn't want to audition for it.  I didn't want to audition for it.  So I just went in there and trashed Spider-Man in the audition.  It was improv.  That was all improv.  Oh my God, that's hilarious.  Yeah, and they said I was the only one who trashed him.  Because everybody else was like, well, he's great.  He's saving the city.  So they actually gave me the part.  And it was like a 45-minute shoot with a second unit in Queens. 
[03:04:30]  Oh my God, that's hilarious.  I didn't get to meet Sam Raimi or Toby or any of them.  That was it.  Second unit.  Yeah.  Wow.  Second unit.  Yeah, it was pretty cool though.  Yeah, but you keep getting checks.  I can't imagine what it's like to be in a real movie like Boogie Nights.  Wait.  I mean, a real, like a park.  I get checks constantly for that.  Like $30 checks, $50 checks.  Yeah.  I know.  That's good.  It's massive digital.  That's fast.  He's just talking about $30 checks.  Oh, another part I had.  Tom Cavanaugh, who plays your brother.  Yeah.  I was in the third episode of Ed, which was his show. 
[03:05:00]  What did you play?  Friend Who Couldn't Act 2.  You were great in that.  Were you Surly?  No, I was actually.  He plays Surly well.  He was creepy.  I had one line.  I was like, friends.  But he was a very nice guy.  He's a great actor too.  He's really nice.  Does he look like Kevin Costner?  He looks like Costner.  A young, handsome Costner.  I never thought of him that way.  All right, good.  Way to try to bond and wreck it.  No, no, no.  No way.  I always think he's kind of.  I think he's kind of got that guy.  You know how guys in old movies are very gentlemanly and sort of witty in that way?  I think he's kind of like an old-time movie actor. 
[03:05:30]  Kind of like Jimmy Stutton.  Like the classic.  Jimmy and Cary Grant.  Like, hello, how are you?  It's just kind of like.  Cary Grant.  He's very charismatic.  Yeah, he's, yeah.  What did you do early on?  Commercials?  Did you start with?  Well, my first job, I got my side card.  I did a hair ad.  And I go, hair doesn't feel like hair.  That was my first line.  That is a stupid line, though.  I know.  It's like hair doesn't.  What else does it feel like?  Well, it's like, oh, because ivory shampoo will make your hair feel like hair and not  like something else.  I don't know what.  I don't know what.  But at least I got my side card.  I made $700, too. 
[03:06:00]  Oh.  That's pretty good.  More than Jimmy makes on his checks.  And then what happened?  Like, what was your big, like, discovery?  How did that happen?  Well, my first movie was Corey Haim and Corey Feldman License to Drive.  The Corys.  I have to say that.  And then I was in.  They're like the Beatles, you know.  I have to say I was in Drugstore Cowboy after that.  So that was kind of cool.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  What did you do with that?  I played, you know, it's about Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch, and then James LeGrow and I  are the other couple.  And it's just about how we're all drug addicts.  Did you ever see it?  Yeah, many years ago.  And I want to say, is the book, it's not an Essie Hinton book, is it? 
[03:06:30]  No.  Okay, because I think I read the book, too.  That would be The Outsiders, right?  I remember that one, yeah.  No, no, no.  This is not like that.  It's totally grungy, like, about these people that steal drugs from drugstores and shoot  them up.  How funny is it that the C. Thomas Howell starred in that cast is the one that nobody cared about  afterwards compared to, like, you know, Matt Dillon and Swayze and Emilio Estevez and the  rest of that cast, nobody gives a shit about him.  I care about him.  No, I'm not saying he's bad.  I don't deeply care about him.  He went to my high school.  Did he really?  Yeah.  What is the C for?  Because Thomas Howell was obviously taken, so he threw a C in front of it. 
[03:07:00]  Like, I'm Jim Norton.  Edward Norton's brother already got into SAG before me, so I had to go Jim J. Norton  like Bullock from stupid Ted Nights.com.  Well, that's like Paul Anderson who did Boogie Nights.  There's another Paul Anderson, so he had to be P.T. Anderson or something.  Oh, Paul Thomas Anderson?  Yeah.  I thought, there's a porn actor named Paul Thomas.  He's like a legendary dirty boy in porn.  That's who I thought that was at first.  Wow.  And was he dating Fiona Apple, too?  Not anymore?  No, no.  I think he's dating this girl from Saturday Night Live, Maya Rudolph, right?  And they just had a baby. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay, yeah, I know who she is.  I don't watch the show.  I'm usually busy.  I was looking for my...  Do you do any...  Let me ask you...  Oh, wait, are you going to talk about my movie?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Let's talk about the movie.  All right, no, we can talk about other things, too.  But I had a question before I asked you, but have you done any of your roles, like anything  you look back on in your career and you go like, ugh.  Yeah, but do you think I would tell you about that?  Yeah, why not?  Like, I'll look back on, like, I've been doing stand-up for 17 years and I can look  back on many shows and go, oh, my God, that was a bad one that I did.  It's terrible.  But do you look back on any roles and go, I wish that was better?  Well, but here on the radio, I want to tell you the movies that were horrible so that 
[03:08:00]  if anyone wants to go watch it, they'll watch it.  Ugh, that'd be terrible.  No, because people would go to rent a movie.  If you were in a movie and you said, I didn't like my performance in that, because people  probably have seen it, they would probably watch it again.  No, maybe they haven't seen it.  Really?  I think there's one that's so bad that hopefully no one has ever seen it.  You just hated yourself in it?  Oh, now we've got to know.  Oh, no, I know.  I mean, I don't think, I just think the whole movie was so bad that, like, there's no way  that I could have been good in it.  And it was, it just shot so bad, oh, it just makes me, like, want to vomit when I think  about it.  It's not Grey Matters.  God, now we've got to know.  It's definitely not Grey Matters.  Let's see, Hope Spring?  Now you're going to run through the whole, let's see. 
[03:08:30]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Wait, what?  You said it probably was a movie that's coming out that I actually feel good about.  We're going to go over my credits of everything I hate?  No.  This is terrible.  You did a make-out scene.  It's in this film, right?  Yeah, Grey Matters.  You know what everybody's talking about?  Yeah.  Make-out scene.  It's got, like, what, a million hits on YouTube?  Yeah, we were watching that this morning.  They put it on YouTube.  How many hits has it gotten?  See, she's just like a million.  No, wait, wait, no, listen, listen, listen.  Everyone loves YouTube.  They put it on for two days, and they said they got 200,000 hits, but I don't know how  many they've gotten since then.  I want to see.  You owe 800,000.  It's ridiculous now.  Let's find out right now.  Yeah, there was a lot of, a lot of.  Because you know what?  We're an independent movie, and we don't have a lot of press, so I hope, like, some 
[03:09:00]  people are going to at least know the movie exists, right?  Oh, they will.  Believe me.  Look on YouTube and see that.  They were showing us before in the other radio studio, and we were watching this show.  Oh, my God.  213,000 views.  Why not think it was over 800,000?  What's wrong with me?  Wait, but there's many different versions, though.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh.  So then you've got to do math.  If you add them all up, it's well over 300,000 views.  Okay, good.  I like the million better.  No, because for some reason I thought it said 800,000 before.  Okay.  I would have lied right now.  So what's the movie about, you could tell us better than anything? 
[03:09:30]  It's about how my brother is Tom Cavanaugh, and we're really good friends, and he meets  Bridget Moynihan, and he falls in love with her, and I fall in love with her, too.  And, you know, I get very confused about what to do.  That is really an odd relationship.  How hot is that?  It's hot in a movie, but the real life thing, that's really creepy.  It would be creepy, right?  But no, I mean, to be honest, I mean, I don't know, but I start to think maybe I'm gay.  So it leads me to the realization of possibly I'm gay.  Possibly. 
[03:10:00]  Do you want me to give it away?  No, no, no, no.  I'm just wondering if it's more of a, just, you know, one of those crush things, or if  it's like, you know, serious, you know, you want to have sex, because that seems to me  to be a wine right there.  Well, there's a very racy, X-rated sex scene that got cut out, but that's on YouTube as  well.  Oh, what?  Where?  What the?  Who the?  Was it really dirty?  It was really dirty.  Can you explain it?  They were like, you know, we just, it's actually such a sweet movie.  They're like, we have to leave out the sex-rated scene.  Really?  Yeah.  Come on, are you sure?  DVD. 
[03:10:30]  Come on, it'll be, director's cut, DVD.  Well, I'm wondering if they left it out, like they left out that scene with, they didn't  leave it out with the Vincent Gallo, Chloe, how do you say it?  Oh, right, right.  No, honestly, I'm just joking.  It's a pretty sweet movie, other than the fact that I get to make out with Bridget.  That's really sexy.  And then there's one scene where I see this girl walking by, and I start to feel like I'm attracted  to girls, and then I see her naked, like walking by.  And originally she was topless, but then the, whatever, the ratings board wouldn't give  us, I guess, a PG-13, so they made her be wearing a bra.  But then I'm just like, isn't that weird, because you can like kill someone and skin 
[03:11:00]  them and stab them and get their head off?  Yeah, we've always said that.  Like death and killing is fine, but the second you see her breasts.  I mean, she doesn't even have that big of boobs.  It's just like pretty, like it didn't even look that like, do you know what I mean?  It was just like some girl walking and...  You've never really had any qualms about doing nude scenes?  Um, it's, oh, I totally, it's nerve-wracking.  It's, it's gotta be nerve-wracking, but like, I mean, you had to make a conscious decision  at some point, like the first time to go, all right, let me do this.  I've only done them twice.  Yeah, but they're really memorable.  That seems to me what...  That's nice. 
[03:11:30]  There's probably been actresses that like, I only do nude scenes, and we're like, who?  Yeah, whatever.  Like Heather Graham, no, every movie, she's naked, I swear to God, it's fantastic.  That's funny.  But you had like, maybe that first time?  Yeah, well, boogieing, I mean, yeah, I mean, I'm not, honestly, I was really nervous, but  I guess I thought, I don't know, it was fun to be in the movie, it was cool.  The thing is, you don't even, especially in Boogie Nights, come off at all like, oh boy,  you can tell she's nervous doing this part like that.  Well, that's, I was, because if you're a porno actor, I guess you'd be really like, whatever.  Yeah, because that's how you played it off. 
[03:12:00]  You know, that's acting.  And you know what to do.  My acting.  With your hands and everything.  Gestures.  And your skates.  Did you watch them shoot at all?  Did you go on any adult sets and watch them?  We did.  It's great, right?  Jimmy's been there.  Let's see, well, okay, we went on one with, what's his name, Ron Jeremy, and he was doing  this thing where he was saying, like, I can control when I orgasm, I'm going to count to  this number and I'll orgasm, and he did, and it was kind of weird.  No, but honestly, they were shooting this thing, and these guys were watching the football  game while they were doing it, like, they kept, you know, they were like, I don't know. 
[03:12:30]  It's just, it's business to them.  It was sort of, I mean, it was, I don't know, it just wasn't as probably exciting as you'd  think.  It's not a second, I've been on a set before, it's not a second.  Guys would lose their heart, a lot of times, the main thing is that guys will lose their  heart if a lot of people are watching, so they don't want people to do it as well.  Jimmy did a scene with Ron Jeremy, so.  Wow.  I actually had a real-life threesome with him.  It didn't last very long, but it was, I hosted the Porn Awards in 2004, and they took  pictures of it.  No way.  Yeah, it was wonderful.  Was that fun?  Yeah, it was.  Did you get any hot dates with Pornow, actually?  No, I hosted with Jenna Jameson, you can't get any, but nothing, I struck out horribly, 
[03:13:00]  they're all like, you're very funny, very funny, 4,000 people and none of them  You got to put a girl on the rotisserie, though, with Ron Jeremy.  With Ron, yeah, but that was for fun, like Ron hooked it up.  Were you not a single, solitary girl?  Like, did you even try?  Yes.  Not even a vibe.  I didn't even get a hint.  Come on.  No, it was like punches to the elbow.  You've never seen more asexual communication than between me and porno actresses.  No.  Didn't you say, like, I'm a big shot, I'm hosting this show?  And then they were like.  It was after the show.  They saw me host it, they saw it went very well, they just, they didn't care.  So me and Ron had that whole thing, it was very, very brief. 
[03:13:30]  But I got to go on sets and watch them, and a couple of the guys were amazing.  Like, there's some guys that could have sex through anything, and other guys  did struggle.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were giggling at something else, but, you know, the guy was like, oh, you guys  have to leave, so we all had to clear the set for him to, you know, to perform.  Crazy him, he doesn't want a bunch of people watching, what's wrong with that guy?  Look, I have problems in a consensual, normal situation, I mean, I get very  distracted, so with 50 guys watching, well, yeah.  Yeah, okay, so do you take, like, any kind of, like, you know, Viagra?  Actually, I'll eat a Viagra, and I don't even chew a Viagra, I'll just hold it under  my tongue like it's nitroglycerin, because I learned that in Brazil. 
[03:14:00]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, does that work better?  Why, does it last longer?  Right into the blood, you know, 100 milligrams.  Your head gets, like, all red and stuffy, your nose gets really stuffy, like, I can't  breathe, but, you know, you're ready to.  Ready for your action.  Yeah, you're stuffy.  Wait, is it better if you take Viagra or if you don't take Viagra?  Is there a difference?  No, I mean, there's times where I don't take it, obviously, but once in a while I'll  take it if I know, like, you've got to be ready in an hour or something like that.  It's better when you do, though.  But you've got to be ready in an hour?  Yeah, like, on a date.  I like to start, like, long before I get home, I want her to see, see, I'm ready to go. 
[03:14:30]  It's almost like, uh, I like to have that happen, like, in the restaurant or whatever,  like, you start to get turned on.  In the restaurant?  Well, it's the way you take it in the restaurant so that you'll be ready with a hard-on, like,  if she...  Oh, yeah.  But how do you know she's going to want...  Have you ever taken it and then she doesn't have sex with you?  Oh, yeah, many times, so then I'm just home admiring it by myself, going, well, I guess  it's just me and you watching TV.  I put a sideways baseball hat on it and we just watch television.  Wait, what do you do?  Do you do then...  When you jerk off and took a Viagra, is it different or is it...  Oh, it's great.  It's...  I've got to be honest... 
[03:15:00]  Put it this way.  It's harder to come, though.  He came in...  He came into work one day and he...  We thought he had pink eye, but it turned out he had gotten something in his eye.  That's how crazy his evening was.  Yeah, it was...  Viagra rules, I mean, uh...  But why does it make you feel kind of crazy or you're just like...  It makes you see, like, a little bit of a blue, uh, tint and it also...  Shut up.  It really does, yeah, and they say that's a side effect of it, but it doesn't hurt your eyes.  Um, and then it, uh, it makes you very congested and, uh, it gives you a headache, whereas... 
[03:15:30]  Because your blood pressure is up.  Absolutely.  It was a side effect of a heart medication.  And, and Cialis lasts for three days.  Cialis is really good.  You take a 20, uh, uh, milligrams or 100 milligrams of Cialis.  Well, not you, but...  No, not you.  But if Cialis is the same as Viagra?  Same as Viagra, but it doesn't, it doesn't, uh, make your nose as stuffy and it lasts for  three days.  It came after Viagra, so they...  Yes.  They figured out the formula a little bit.  Okay, but once you take these things with the girls into it, or are they like, wow, this  is too much?  Oh, no, it doesn't do much to it.  I mean, it might give you a little bit extra of size, not a whole lot, just like a little  bit of extra, like, you know, a little... 
[03:16:00]  But no, does it make you want to go forever, like hours and hours, and the girl's like,  okay, this is too long, or she is into it?  It can.  If, if, if I take 100 milligrams, I'm not coming for a while.  I mean, it's like, just go and come back, you know, and I'll be here.  Whatever you need to do, shower.  It's just simply because it's not allowing you to.  It's nothing to do with my ability.  Yeah.  If I take 25 or 50 milligrams, then I can come a little bit better.  It's, it's actually better.  I don't think girls, like, lay in there for, like, two hours straight being pounded on.  That's what I tell myself, at least.  Well, no, she likes it in 30 seconds.  It's easy.  She can get up, commercial.  You know, we convince ourselves that what we're doing is just what they want. 
[03:16:30]  Wait, do you have a girlfriend?  Yes, I do.  You do.  First time in five years.  Now we do.  All right, wait, so do you, does she like the Viagra or better without the Viagra?  She never, I mean, I don't actually show her I'm taking it.  I just, all of a sudden, she thinks, like, wow, I'm dating a man, you know, and  until she catches me in between doses, and she's like, what's the matter?  I'm like, I don't know.  I must be sick.  Oh, my.  Fucking.  Wait, so you're nervous that she would find out that you wouldn't get a heart on at the  right moment?  Yeah, it would just dangle there like an atrophied worm, you know, just humiliate me and mock  me, and almost tell her, like, you know, give me some drugs, you know.  So, no, it's, she turns me out very much, though. 
[03:17:00]  I mean, it's the first time I've been in a relationship in a long time.  That's nice.  How long have you been with her?  A few months.  We've been friends for years.  You say love.  Yeah, I think I'm in love.  That's nice.  Yeah, I don't fuck around.  I mean, I really like her.  That's nice.  She's great, and that's her birthday.  Boy, before his girlfriend, though.  Wow.  It's her birthday?  Today is, yeah.  I'm going to go out to a French restaurant.  Yeah, very cute.  Jimmy has some stories before the girlfriend.  I don't know if you want to show them.  You know, my girl, she's the worst.  I was telling the story on the CBS side.  She's really funny.  Like, she'll go down on me, and then after she's done, she'll just go, hey, does my breath  smell like I'm, and she blows in my face. 
[03:17:30]  She's, it makes me, that's what I would do if I was a girl.  She's a fellow.  What do you mean to do her, girl?  What's that?  Stop it.  Don't make excuses.  Yeah, no, I was a dirty boy, and, you know, it's nice to be in a relationship.  All right, so wait, do you want to, how many, I'm just curious, how many times a week do  you want to have sex?  I don't know.  I mean, for me.  I'm just curious about the Viagra thing.  Maybe you're just forcing yourself to have sex when you really don't want to.  There have been times where I've had that, yeah.  That's mostly the sexual addiction, the internet stuff.  You know what I mean?  Like, you get so programmed on the internet to just jerk off me, you're not even horny, you're 
[03:18:00]  just doing it.  You're like, why am I doing this?  There's no reason for that.  Ask him about hookers.  What?  Well, you've gone out with hookers.  Who hasn't?  I mean, my God, yeah.  I've never gone out with any hookers.  All right, well.  I think women are a little bit, because women have much different standards, because women  make the choice.  With women, it's normally the choice.  Women make some bad choices, though.  Yeah, they do.  Believe me.  My girlfriend, case in point.  She doesn't listen to the show.  No, wait, how many times a week do you and your girlfriend have sex?  Not as many as you think.  I mean, maybe intercourse, sometimes three times a week, sometimes seven times a week, 
[03:18:30]  sometimes twice.  It depends if you're on a period.  I've been getting into digitally getting her off, though, with my hands.  It's been nice lately, because she likes to fight a little spanking, and then you discipline  somebody, yeah, and then you just talk to them while you're, yeah, yeah, yeah, she likes  that.  She's good.  She's a good age.  Wait, she doesn't mind if you tell all this stuff about her on the radio?  Oh, she hates it.  Right.  Are you kidding?  She hates it.  That's why I don't say who she is, because she gets really annoyed.  She doesn't want her personal life blown out like that.  Of course, your friends know that you're her boyfriend, right? 
[03:19:00]  Probably, yeah.  If she's with Jimmy, she probably doesn't have many friends left.  Yeah, I'm sure she's heard a few bad things.  You notice that he has no hair on his arms?  Very little.  Would you let Heather just touch it really fast?  It's not that much.  He has a little bit.  It's embarrassing.  It's wispy.  They always think people feel my arms because I have no hair.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Is that weird?  No, that's weird.  Oh, my God.  That old gag.  I haven't gotten anybody in a year with her.  Oh, really?  But yeah, no, she's a good girl.  I mean, I'm definitely in love.  How about you? 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, I'm dating a guy who's really nice.  An actor?  No.  Really?  Is he a regular guy?  Is he in the business?  He's a guy.  He's not in the business.  Everyone had a shot.  Well, is that intimidating for him, though?  I mean, you're Heather Grant.  No, he's extremely arrogant.  Oh, really?  So you like that, right?  Well, no, he's actually not arrogant.  He's confident.  He's very nice, actually.  Have to be.  You know what?  The thing is, he really is very...  You know when you go out with someone and you feel like they appreciate you?  Like, he's very appreciative.  It makes me feel good.  Yeah.  How long?  He's nice.  Like six months? 
[03:20:00]  Six months.  Oh, look at that.  Where do you meet a non-in-the-business guy who's not...  Like, how do you not be impressed if that's Heather Graham?  That's okay.  It's Heather Graham.  Okay, he's a club owner.  Okay.  Is that bad?  No, why?  If you're a girl, you don't really think, oh, I really want to date a club owner.  But he's like a business guy.  He used to be a banker.  Now he owns clubs.  He wants to, like, own hotels and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what you want to do.  That's nothing wrong.  I mean, club owners have great reputations of being great guys.  No, they don't.  That's the thing.  It's like, when I first met him, I'm like, I'm not going to go out with a club owner.  This is so bad.  But then it was like, I just knew... 
[03:20:30]  I kind of, like, just was friends with him for a few months first.  So then I was like, hmm.  He was okay.  And then, okay, this is bad.  But, okay, there's this woman that I talked to, and she's, like, had this psychic.  She's like, he's going to be a really good guy.  He's really into you.  I'm like, but he's a club owner.  And I'm like, okay, I'll give him a chance.  I'd have to say he's, like, the nicest, one of the nicest guys I've ever gone out with.  Yeah?  Even though he's a club owner.  Uh-oh.  You're going to get one of these, though, one day?  Heather, I'm having trouble with one of these.  Could you just come down and kind of hang out and drink and, you know, be at the club?  I like his club. 
[03:21:00]  Kind of use it.  I don't, you know, I'm not a very big club girl.  Like, I would totally show up at his club, but I'm not, like, you know.  Yeah.  Does he ask you to?  Having a slow night.  Get down there.  I'm a big sign out for on Heather Graham drinks here.  He had a concert the other night with Cat Power.  So, I was like, cool.  I want to go.  She sang it as a play.  So, that was cool.  This is what a dope I am.  No, this is how dumb I am.  I almost said, how is he?  Who is he?  Oh, my God.  No, it's like a cool alternative, groovy.  And I think Patti Smith, maybe she, I don't know if she's going to go.  She might play there, too.  So, it's like, kind of interesting things. 
[03:21:30]  It's not just, like, get totally bombed and, like, plus, I kind of like dancing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Did he ever, this is a personal question, but did he ever ask you, like, to put the, like,  I honestly, if I was dating Heather Graham, I mean, I mean, it's probably beyond, you know,  reasonable assumption that that would happen, I'm guessing.  That showed a lot of confidence there that she likes.  You don't want to go out, do you?  You hate me.  Well, you're in love with your girlfriend.  She would be gone tomorrow.  I'd throw in a coffin alive.  Oh, come on.  I love her. 
[03:22:00]  I love her.  If I have a shot with Heather Graham, coffin lid shut.  They would never find her again.  No, she'd be, come on, you're kidding, aren't you?  No.  No.  No.  But did you ever, like, I would probably, if I was dating, I can't even look at what I  said, but I would probably request that you at least once with the roller skate.  Honestly, I'm not even kidding.  I would request that at once.  Wow.  No one's ever asked me that.  Oh, my.  But I do have a pair of them in my house in this little tiny alcove, just like, I don't  know, I kept them.  As a little, yeah.  Was that you in the scene when, it was after, after, after Wahlberg left, you know, Dirk 
[03:22:30]  Digg was out doing his thing, and then there's the new stud in town, and the girl who goes  up, will he fuck me in the ass?  And Bert Reynolds goes, she wants you to fuck her in the ass.  Was that you?  That was such a great scene.  Why, were you picturing that in your mind?  No, no, no, no, no.  It was just a funny scene, because it was so casual the way they discussed it, and Bert's  like, you're gonna fuck her in the ass.  And the girl's like, okay.  No better scene than this.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Yeah.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  After he pulls this.  Do you want to kiss me?  Do you want to kiss you on the mouth?  I want to kiss you on the mouth. 
[03:23:00]  And he had his car painted just like Dirk's.  He looks too more often when he tries to kiss him.  Oh, he is so good in that movie.  And you know, Nina Hartley, the porn girl who was shot by Bill Macy, I made out with  her at the end of an independent film.  It was a comedy.  We got to mug it out at the end of the movie.  Was it fun?  I think it was.  For me, yes.  She has videos about how to, you know.  Perform panelling.  Oh, yeah, I have one.  Yeah, all kinds.  Oh, really?  I have one like that.  Yeah, my method was always wrong.  I would go for three seconds and go, are you gonna come?  Are you gonna come?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's wrong.  Wait, what did she tell you to do?  I don't know. 
[03:23:30]  I actually never watched the video.  Oh, my God.  I'm so afraid I'm gonna be completely off the mark.  Yeah, it's like, what have I been doing all these years?  Nothing.  So the movie, we got to promote the movie.  Yeah, let's talk about Grey Matters.  Yeah, let's talk about Grey Matters.  It's Grey Matters, and I mean, it's really cool, because Kavanaugh's a great actor.  You're obviously you, and Sissy Spacek is fantastic.  Oh, yeah, it's cool.  And also, my best friend Molly, one of my good friends, Molly Shannon's in it, and she's  really good.  She's really funny.  Mm-hmm.  And Sissy Spacek, Alan Cummings.  Who does Sissy Spacek play?  She plays my therapist.  She's like a really bad therapist. 
[03:24:00]  Bad as in shitty or like mean?  Bad as in like shitty and mean.  Oh, both.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  I like that.  But not like, kind of just passive-aggressive.  Like, sort of like seems nice, but if you really think about it, kind of like weird.  When you're acting with her, are you thinking, this is Carrie?  Like, do you do that when you're acting?  Like, do you think, like, this is Pelazo?  No, I'm more thinking about the Badlands, because I really like the Badlands.  Was she in that?  I didn't even see it.  Yeah, too.  Dude, that's one of the greatest all-time, have you guys seen that movie?  No.  Badlands?  No.  Dude.  They've seen everything, too.  I've seen everything, too.  Martin Sheen, Sissy Spacek.  It's a classic Terrence Malick movie.  You have to watch it.  All right.  Now we have to. 
[03:24:30]  It's one of the all-time greats.  You gave us a homework assignment.  Yeah.  Seriously, go watch it.  I really want it.  When Heather Graham gives you a homework assignment.  Yeah, you watch.  I want to be listening to the show, and I want you to talk about the Badlands and say  how good it was.  Okay.  You're a great guest.  Are you really honest?  Oh, we're fantastic.  Where's the favorite place, by the way?  Favorite place?  Oh, it's a master base.  You said that it wasn't a car.  In bed, right?  At least you're relaxed.  Comfy.  Yeah.  Everything's right there.  Your tissues, anything else you need.  How old school are you?  Your tissues?  Who uses them?  Not me.  Aim for the rug. 
[03:25:00]  Aim for the cat.  All right.  We've got to get her out of here.  I just say Grey Matters a few more times.  Grey Matters.  When does it come out?  It comes out this weekend in five cities, and then on March 9th it comes out in a bunch more.  Okay.  Is it a limited release?  Because I was an independent film.  It's an independent film, and it's funny, and it's sweet.  It's kind of like a feel-good movie.  So when you leave, you just feel good.  And the trailer's on YouTube.  The make-out scene's on YouTube.  Oh, it's hot, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the website's greymattersmovie.com for more information.  Well, how do you go on YouTube and look up the scene?  Because I was thinking... 
[03:25:30]  Just go to youtube.com, and I guess you have...  If you put in Heather Graham in there, I'm sure it'll just pop right up.  Or do you have to put in Grey Matters?  It's G-R-A-Y, by the way, not G-R-E-Y, the British version.  We'll put in your name.  Listen to Jimmy.  I'm just curious.  It's the British version.  Is that really true?  It's the British version.  No, no, I'm saying G-R-A-Y.  I think G-R-E-Y is the British version.  Oh, wow, Heather.  All right, this is what we got for you on YouTube.  You got 70 videos.  Shut up.  We got Heather Graham.  Yeah, I'm afraid to look up that stuff.  We got Heather Graham doing a backbend on Craig Gilmore. 
[03:26:00]  That's so horrible.  You got your make-out scene from Grey Matters.  Mm-hmm.  What else?  Do you put in my name on YouTube, and then you get it?  Yeah, yeah.  Some Boogie Night stuff.  Trying to see some...  Wow, a glamour shot from you.  Wow.  Very nice.  Ah.  Oh, look at that.  70 videos.  70?  Yeah, that's quite impressive.  Interesting.  Are you getting ready to take your top off?  You know how many hits that is getting right now, YouTube?  Everyone that's listening is...  I've got to see this. 
[03:26:30]  It's a sexy make-out scene, too.  So wait, you guys, XM and Sirius Radio merch.  What is the deal?  Why did that happen?  See, we don't know either.  We're fired.  We're in this position like, ah, yeah, they could throw us out the door tomorrow.  Who the hell knows?  No.  Eh.  We don't know.  Oh, believe me.  Come on now.  You know this stupid business.  Well, I have XM.  I don't have Sirius, so I only know XM.  Do you listen to us?  For right now, good.  I'm going to start listening to you.  We have our own channel.  Can I just tell you, I'm not that...  I don't really know what all the channels are.  I just get a...  I stick it on one channel and just leave it there.  Are you like the 80s?  What's your favorite channel?  Okay, are you to think I'm dorky? 
[03:27:00]  But I kind of like the Starbucks channel.  What is that?  Really?  It's alternative.  That's like kind of a girl singing about love.  And lost love.  It's sort of like kind of sad, melancholy, like Damien Rice, kind of like, you know.  Yeah.  I know, that's good.  And my friend Josh Radin, he is...  They play his music on there.  And that's like all you leave on?  Well, I got...  Okay, I got to expand my XM radio.  Go to...  Yeah.  Check out 202.  That's our channel.  That's our channel.  Okay, 202.  We're on 24 hours...  Well, no, we got Ron and Fez doing it.  Ron and Fez doing it.  Okay, so wait, how many... 
[03:27:30]  What time do you guys come on?  All right, this is a stupid question.  No, it's not.  We're not.  You start at, what, 5 a.m.?  It's ridiculous.  5 a.m.?  6 to 11 every day in the morning.  6 to 11, okay.  And then we replay later in the day.  All day.  Okay.  So you can tune in at any minute.  But do you guys have, like, do you go out to dinner and stay out later or you can't  because you have to get up at 4?  Well, we have to go home and nap.  Yeah, yeah, you nap.  Take a stupid nap and then wake up later and then it feels like the next day.  And then you're out and you got to keep looking at your watch because you got to go to bed.  Wow.  It's a ridiculous lifestyle.  That is like my nightmare of having to get up early every day. 
[03:28:00]  It sucks.  I do stand up at night.  So it's like you do this and then you go home and sleep for a little while.  Oh, my God.  Where do you do stand up?  Usually in the village, a comedy salon in the village.  And then you do that and then go home by, like, 1, get up at 5.  Wow.  You know.  These guys are in bed at a decent hour, which is why they're much more effective on the air.  This might be a little inside, but I do have to ask.  James Tolbeck.  Yeah.  Is he a creep?  Be honest.  Well, okay.  He's trying to pick up my girl.  Oh, right.  That's the guy.  He's one of those guys where I think he is special. 
[03:28:30]  He goes after lots of women.  Thank you.  And I think he actually gets some of them.  He's a mess of a human being.  We were at a bank, and I'm doing some banking.  My girlfriend's waiting for me near the door.  Yeah, yeah.  He walked up to her and said, I could get you in movies.  Oh, ha, ha.  Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  No, I think he's, like, a notorious, like, you know, womanizer, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He came off like that.  He told her that she didn't really need any portfolio or anything. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No acting.  I mean, actually, like, he does have a side of his personality that is, you know, interesting,  and he's, like, a smart, interesting guy.  But then he is kind of, in terms of, he's kind of, he seems like sort of, like, one of  those people that's just addicted to, you know, the seduction of women, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Creep.  Oh, my gosh, your girlfriend knew it.  She didn't fall for it at all.  Oh, no, no, no.  She knew it immediately.  Yeah.  My girlfriend I would never see again.  It would really work, you think?  Is she an actress?  She does act.  She's not really an actress.  Is she a comedian? 
[03:29:30]  She does comedy, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she's really funny, too.  And every guy says that.  I know we've got to get you out of here.  They're, like, she's got to go, right?  Yeah.  Nod, nod, nod, nod, nod, nod.  And we need picture time.  Yeah, we have to get picture.  Keep saying gray matters.  Yes, gray matters.  We'll promote for the rest of the week.  Are you kidding?  Okay, cool.  Anyone that calls our show, don't forget to plug Heather Graham's movie.  John in Jersey.  Quick.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Real fast.  All right.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  And I just want to say that Heather Graham is the coolest guest ever on the ONA show.  She's great.  She rocks. 
[03:30:00]  Love you, Heather.  That's nice.  Yeah, a lot of girls come in, and, boy, they clam up.  Oh, really?  And they just like that.  See, I could even go worse, but we are on the radio.  If we weren't on the radio right now, I'd be...  You can curse on this radio.  I'd probably be not saying more.  This is satellite radio.  Just curse.  Even the dreaded C-bomb is totally acceptable.  I can just curse?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's your favorite...  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good one.  See how free of that is?  She interviewed us.  No, but seriously, I could be way more raunchy if I didn't, like, think, okay, well, some  people might be actually listening to this.  Yeah.  There might be a couple of people. 
[03:30:30]  Most people listen to the Starbucks channel, though.  I'm teasing.  We have to get pictures with Heather.  Yes.  Go to break, goddammit.  And go see Great Matters, you bums.  Yeah.  And make sure you listen to 202 when you're driving around.  Okay, I will.  Please.  Okay.  And then call us, because then we'll feel like we have a friend.  Yeah.  Okay, wait.  Will you see Badlands?  That we have a hot friend.  Watch Badlands, and then I'm just curious to see if you like it or not.  And then we'll have to give our reviews.  And we'll have a discussion.  We'll give our reviews.  Okay.  I'm curious.  All right.  Great Matters this Friday.  Heather Graham, everyone. 
[03:31:00]  Be right back.  Oh, s***.  The virus is out.  Tell your friends.  He's affected.  That's right, Opie.  Hey, shut your f***.  Shut your mouth.  I love the homoerotic nature of the whole event.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  Whoa, dude.  Don't come near me.  We're your celebrity skin cancer connection.  And it was better than my first kiss.  Oh, laugh until your energy spill out on the chair.  The Anthony Show. 
[03:31:30]  How cool.  Oh, my God.  How cool was Heather Graham?  Really great.  Let's plug Great Matters like crazy.  Let's help her out a little bit, huh?  Great Matters in a few theaters on Friday.  Yeah.  And get her views up on YouTube, okay?  She loves the YouTube as well.  I'm sorry I babbled a little.  Babble, babble, babble, babble. 
[03:32:00]  Yap, yap, yap, yap.  I was a babble, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap,  yap, yap, yap, yap.  Actually, we're all getting abused by my chickadee.  Hey, blank, which is my pet name that you can't know.  While it's schnookums.  It's not schnookums.  It's not schnookums.  Did you see it?  Wait, I know what it is.  You saw it, didn't you?  I know what it is.  Hey, blank. 
[03:32:30]  Wait, wait.  Which is my pet name.  Yeah, I know what it is.  What is it?  She's called you that on the road and stuff when we've been on road trips.  What?  What?  What letters to start with?  I'm not going to say.  All right, good.  Just a letter.  I know what it is.  Yeah, M.  What?  Oh, no.  Starts with an M.  Boardroom Jimmy, shut up.  All right.  She writes, I don't know.  And I know Heather Graham is really hot. 
[03:33:00]  She writes, I don't know.  I don't know.  And I know Heather Graham is really hot.  Now, more importantly, you all, all in capital letters, sounded like smitten high school students,  nervous chatter, laughing at her dumb jokes.  Wow.  I've never seen ha, ha, ha.  Hey, there she is on TV.  H's and A's in my life.  She was just in here, and now I'm watching her on the TV. 
[03:33:30]  But then she writes, God, hilarious.  She was a good guest.  My girlfriend just sent me one, too.  You're now single.  Oh.  You put her in a coffin alive, you sold her.  Jesus.  Maybe you went a little far with that one.  I don't know why I did that.  Hey, did my breath smell like cum?  I got to tell her that.  It makes me laugh.  It is so funny because it's so fucking wrong for a girl to do it. 
[03:34:00]  That's a guy sense of humor thing coming out of a fucking girl like that.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  If Bob Kelly said that to you, then we'd understand.  And he probably could.  She fucking blows her cum breath in my face and just, I fucking, I can't stop laughing.  It's disgusting.  It's disgusting.  If I have hot food in my mouth, like sometimes I have hot food in my mouth, and she'll go,  is that hot?  And I go, yeah.  And then she'll blow into my mouth.  She just goes, oh, is that hot?  Yeah. 
[03:34:30]  I'm like, I'm right.  Stop it.  She was pestering me.  You guys want to hear an O&A name drop?  Yes.  Oh.  All right.  This might bring on Boardroom Jimmy.  You never know.  You never know when Boardroom Jimmy's going to.  Oh, my God.  Jeez, it's been an hour.  What are you doing?  What do you got over there?  We were mentioned in the conference call.  It was at the beginning when we were still on the other side.  We were.  And we got the audio.  Damn it.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:35:00]  You checking?  Well, I was going to pop it up.  All right.  Here we go.  Go ahead.  Where do you find that?  XM and Sirius already have the best personalities in the entertainment industry.  But today, if you want to listen to Howard Stern and Opie and Anthony, you need to subscribe  to both services.  The same applies to Martha and Oprah, football and baseball.  Thank you.  As well as other exclusive and premium branded content.  Thank you, Gary. 
[03:35:30]  Thank you, Gary.  This transaction is about choice.  Doing it the way.  Over time, we look forward to providing our subscribers with this enhanced programming lineup,  something that we know they will enjoy and they will value.  Yes, of course.  We all, I mean, these just, I don't want to get into the technical talk of this.  That's the way it's supposed to be done.  Absolutely.  Like you say that, you know.  And then the moderator mispronounces Mel's last name.  What's the?  It's Mel Karmazin.  Yes.  Good one.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mel Karmazin, Chief Executive Officer. 
[03:36:00]  Karmazin, you dolt.  Dumb conference call operator.  You do, Karmazin.  Hey, Mel Karmazin.  Hey, Karmazin.  Holy shit.  Good thing.  I thought we'd have to deal with Mel Karmazin again.  Who's this Mel Karmazin guy?  He might be a good guy.  Mel is snapped when he hits 60.  He's like, this is a young character he does.  I'm Mel Karmazin.  He's got his shirt open.  Hey.  Mel Karmazin, how the fuck do you do it?  Oh, nasty. 
[03:36:30]  Hey, we're going to take this fucking company to the top, huh, motherfuckers.  We're going to grab XM by the Cajuns.  Hey.  Hey, Mel Karmazin, get the fuck out of here.  We get to hang out with the wise guys now.  Hey, Karmazin.  The wise guys and their radio show.  Maybe we can bring them some meatballs.  Hey, we'll bring them some macabalama.  Hey, my money used to make meatballs like this.  Rest in peace.  No, fuck out of here.  No, fuck out of here.  Fuck out of here.  How do we, idiots. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, God.  This sucks.  How did he respond to Karmazin?  Did he say it's Karmazin?  Maybe we get to kick Martha in the cunt.  Oh.  I doubt we'd be allowed to do that.  I don't know.  But that was the accurate comparison.  Howard, Opie, Anthony, Oprah, Martha, baseball, football.  That was accurate.  Yeah.  When they do Howard, Oprah.  But come on.  It's like, what?  Here we go.  Maybe for money.  Karmazin.  Go.  That's Mel Karmazin.  Go.  Let's listen to that.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mel Karmazin, Chief Executive Officer 
[03:37:30]  of Sirius Satellite Radio.  Please go ahead, sir.  Okay.  Well, hopefully the volume of calls that caused the problem is over, and I have no problem  with the pronunciation of my name.  I want to thank you all for joining us today.  I'm happy to be joined by Gary Parsons, Chairman of XM Satellite Radio.  Happy to be here.  Happy to be here.  A little nervous.  Mel Karmazin.  I'm Mel Karmazin.  This is my wife, Cynthia Karmazin, and my kid, Dana Karmazin. 
[03:38:00]  Dana.  My friend, Dierks Bentley.  Mel Karmazin.  Hey.  Holy fuck.  Is that Mel Karmazin?  Hey, that motherfucker owes me money, huh?  Hey, uh.  Oh, we did that.  Can we get Elo on the phone?  What's going on or what?  Where's he hiding?  I want to know where Elo is.  Uh, uh, uh, uh.  All right, rabbit.  Where's Elo?  Where's he hiding? 
[03:38:30]  Now, this is, uh.  He ain't in this stove.  I want to take notice now.  What?  What, sweetie?  Oh, the media is going to get a beating from us.  We've been taking notice.  That's how we end the show today.  Oh, we will get the media back.  We got a sample of, uh, news clips reporting the big merger between these, uh, two companies.  Now, let me tell you something.  They hate us because of our assaults on the media.  They don't like saying our name, period.  That's fine. 
[03:39:00]  Uh, but now they will pay.  Yeah.  They hit us back by doing this.  Now we hit them back.  Now we have to show, now we have to tell the world who we are because you're not telling them.  That's what we do now.  We have the sign in front of Bruno D'Italia at two o'clock.  At two o'clock.  All right.  Some quick clips.  The guys have been collecting these all day.  This is, uh, our good friend, Mr. Imus.  Don Imus.  This is how he reported today.  We haven't talked about the proposed merger between XM and Sirius, which, uh, I don't understand how it works. 
[03:39:30]  Uh, if, I mean, it will work.  The wheel?  No crime is going to run the company, which is, gives it a shot at least making it.  Good news.  Um, but Sirius stock was sold at 370, which is, uh, somewhat under what some people bought it at.  Yeah.  And, uh, so on the proposed deal, for every share of XM stock you have, you'd get 4.6 shares of Sirius, but I don't know. 
[03:40:00]  I don't understand.  I need Robert Andrews or James Kramer, somebody to explain it to you.  Deal, deal.  I'm trying to see if I can figure that stock thing out, but I don't see any details here in this particular piece.  I'm not ever going to make any money, so forget that.  Is that a private phone call?  I love it.  It's not a private phone call. 
[03:40:30]  What the fuck was that?  Is that just them talking?  Wow.  I love the fact.  Hymus is really, he really doesn't say much, does he?  He's wonderful.  God.  I mean, I love the guy, but.  He doesn't like me, but I love him.  Wow.  Is that just a private something?  Yeah.  What do you, uh.  I, uh.  I bought that stock in a little lower, but, um.  What, what do you want for lunch, guys?  I'm thinking, uh. 
[03:41:00]  My burger.  Maybe, uh.  Some, uh.  Fries.  Fries, burger.  Got it.  Anything on your burger?  Uh.  Ketchup.  Ketchup, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shut up.  Jerk.  Mel Carmazin.  You gotta.  Carmazi.  Mel Carmazi.  I don't know much about the deal, deal.  Deal.  But, uh.  Mel Carmazi's running it, which. 
[03:41:30]  The Carmazi family, uh.  They're tough.  By the way.  Are we on the air?  Yeah, we are.  Uh.  By the way.  Bill from Philly.  Did you guys hear that Bubba's producer talked with Mel Carmazi yesterday?  Carmazi.  And Mel said that Opie and Anthony were not long for the company.  Ah, ha, yeah, sure.  Seriously, he claimed that.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  We're not long for the company?  Yeah, well, Bubba's.  Let me tell you something.  Bubba and his producer are a bunch of douches.  Bubba's producer, first of all, has no contact with Mel Carmazi or Mel Carmazin. 
[03:42:00]  You don't think Mel called Bubba's producer?  Yeah.  Mel would call Bubba's producer the show that's trying to ride the coattails of Howard's show.  He gets the inside scoop.  Yeah.  No one else.  No one else.  It's Mel, it's Gary Parsons, and this nameless, we don't even know his name, Bubba's producer.  So what Mel did was the name that Gary Parsons is going to mention in this merger, which is 
[03:42:30]  Opie and Anthony next to Stern, and then Martha, he's just going to just diss the show to Bubba's  Exactly.  Shut up, Bubba.  I didn't hear Bubba's name in there.  I haven't been hearing Bubba's name at all mentioned in this merger.  Oh, enough.  Shut up.  It isn't a serious buyout.  It's a merger between two companies.  You know what, those dopes over there, they're laughing and stuff because they have this  feeling because Mel's kind of going to run this whole thing that it's a complete takeover 
[03:43:00]  and stuff.  They should be walking those halls scared shitless.  Half the people here are getting fired, half the people there are getting fired.  This is a scary time for XM and serious employees.  Simple as that.  They think it's like...  They think for a second that, yeah, everyone at XM's getting fired and everyone at  serious is keeping their job.  Let's keep laughing, fat boy.  It's a merger.  Keep laughing.  Oh, fuck it.  Keep laughing.  Keep laughing, fat boy.  You got me so excited, I couldn't say it a second time. 
[03:43:30]  Fat boy.  Like Mel Carmazi.  You fat piece of shit.  How are those staples doing?  Are they starting to pull a little bit?  Because you've got to keep feeding that fat face of yours?  Fatso.  Mel Carmazin talked with his producer.  Do you honestly think...  That Mel Carmazin would even give the time of day to Bubba's producer and give any sensitive  information as to who's staying and who's going in a merger that isn't even going to 
[03:44:00]  fucking take place if it does at all for another year?  Do you think he's going there and giving that guy inside info?  This is the same show, by the way, that said we were done here.  Remember what...  Here, let me refresh everyone's memory.  Out of the Bubba the Love Cunt camp, Opie and Anthony were getting fired from XM.  Did he say you could bank on it?  Bank on it.  It's a guarantee.  In October.  Their contract will not be renewed. 
[03:44:30]  It's a done deal.  They're getting fired.  Oh, you might be thinking, oh, this coming October?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  That was last October.  Last October.  Last October.  You know, after...  We're still here, fat boy!  After we had signed an extension.  Sorry.  Yeah, not only did we not get fired, but we had signed an extension to stay here longer.  There's three things I now like to say.  You dumb fuck.  There's three things I now like to say.  Walt Baums.  Walt Baums.  Neil Bortz.  And Fat Boy.  As a matter of fact, yeah, that is true. 
[03:45:00]  I wasn't going to say anything about it, but I spoke to Gary Parsons, and I heard the  same thing about Bubba's show.  Not long for the platform.  So there you go.  There's not room for everyone.  There ain't going to be room for everybody.  It's a 50-50 merger, my friend.  It's a merger, not a takeover, not a buyout.  It's a merger.  Which means half of you's fucking go in both camps. 
[03:45:30]  And bye-bye.  And let's just wait when Mel Carmazzi sees what we have done.  Mel Carmazzi.  Hey, Paisan, I call him.  What have you done, Fat Boy?  Yeah, Fat Boy, what are you billing?  Can you back it up with numbers like we can, Fat Boy?  What do you do besides hang out with Neil Bortz and go to Walt Baums, Fat Boy?  Yeah, jack off.  It does feel good.  Yeah, it does.  Especially three in a row.  Don't forget about King Collin. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, maybe you should go to King Collin and look for employment.  You won't be working at Walt Baums, Fat Boy.  So you and Neil Bortz can go to King Collin.  I hope Boardroom Jimmy shows up one last time before we get up there.  Boardroom Jimmy is a cunt sniffer.  All right, here we go.  So that was Ibis.  And, well, let's see how 10-10 wins did.  10-10 wins.  All news.  All day.  All night.  Holy shit.  Pothole alert. 
[03:46:30]  Pothole alert.  Time.  You give us 22 minutes.  We'll scare the living fuck out of you.  Oh, we're in chaos mode and we couldn't be happier.  That's what I have to say to all the message boards today.  Shake it up.  They all want our comment today.  We love it.  We love fucking chaos.  We're at home with chaos.  You watch what we do next.  The two satellite radio companies, XM and Sirius, have agreed to merge.  Both XM and Sirius posted significant financial losses as they built up their programming and 
[03:47:00]  attracted subscribers.  Both stocks declined about 40% last year.  But investors believe a merger could bring down costs significantly.  Sirius is home to Howard Stern while XM features the Opie and Anthony show.  And the deal faces substantial obstacles in Washington, including an FCC provision that  specifically forbids the two companies to combine.  There you go.  That guy's a fan of the show.  You can tell.  It specifically forbids the two companies from your mind. 
[03:47:30]  Wow.  Whoa, boy.  Sirius features Howard Stern while XM features Opie and Anthony.  FCC rules saying that the two companies cannot combine.  What the fuck was that?  I don't ask for requests often.  You know that, Anthony.  I don't like putting you on the spot.  I hear you.  Could you do news guy talking to wife and maybe news guy telling wife to get that sexy  number ready for later tonight?  I'm home on it. 
[03:48:00]  Why don't you put on one of those nice leaves and wait in the bedroom for me?  I'll be taking a shower, come out nice and clean, and shove my cock in your mouth.  Tonight at 10.  Speaking of mergers, we're going to be merging.  Merging.  In about an hour.  With your asshole.  After I drink enough to make you look pretty.  Hey, it's nothing but ass sex this evening.  Ass sex Tuesday. 
[03:48:30]  Tuesday.  That guy sounded like a fool.  He was a buff.  But at least, you know.  Let's hear New York 1.  Fair enough.  New York 1.  New York 1.  Who will be on the fucko list today?  Howard Stern and Oprah Winfrey may soon share the same airwaves as two satellite radio rivals  agree to murder.  Airwaves.  Oprah Winfrey.  Oprah Winfrey and her one hour of radio a fucking week.  As we do 25.  I think that's just a woman, to be honest with you, just, I don't think that's a gender  driven New York 1. 
[03:49:00]  I think that's just her reading out of the paper.  Yeah.  But what are they, like, am I correct there?  Like, even the paper, though, writing it.  I mean, obviously, there are, obviously, both platforms have the comparable shows.  You have the, if you have the high profile, been in the news, shock jock show, it's Howard  Stern, Opie and Anthony.  And that's just the way it goes.  Then you have the bitch driven fucking cunt channels, which is like Oprah and, what's 
[03:49:30]  her name?  Martha.  Martha.  That's your bitches.  They listen to that shit.  And then you have your baseball and your football, your sports stuff.  Hockey and basketball.  There you go.  The AP story, which apparently everybody's just reading off, said, now you can get Howard  and Oprah in the same place.  But Oprah's not on the radio.  It's Oprah and friends.  Don't forget, that's all they know.  A lot of them is that Oprah and Howard were fighting, and that was, because he was having  his listeners, because he can play together. 
[03:50:00]  The sound of her voice, that was the APE story.  Trust me, Karmazi's going to be looking at some of these deals.  Okay, hold on.  You know what?  I didn't even hear you.  I'm sorry.  What you missed was, it was a car crash and a bell all in one.  And the bell wouldn't work.  Who took my bell apart?  Oh, no.  It was a bell car crash.  Yeah.  Just repeat it.  He didn't hear that.  Okay.  Shut up.  You think I'm falling for that.  Can we rewind that?  How about a little?  I mean, Anthony shouldn't have to repeat it, but maybe we could rewind it. 
[03:50:30]  Jimmy!  I do.  I think it was funny, and it deserves something.  It was a good racist joke.  It certainly was.  We won't be having any more of those on this platform.  No.  Not with the new amortization.  What?  Wait, I think Stock Boardroom Jimmy's making another appearance on the Opie and Anthony show.  Boardroom Jimmy doesn't want to run himself into the ground.  Let's just say amortization.  Wow.  Really?  Yes.  I don't know what that means.  Of course you don't.  What do you think of the glass ceiling? 
[03:51:00]  Fiscal years will shut the glass ceilings down.  Fiscal years.  I don't even know what he's talking about.  Of course you don't.  It's way above your head, as the glass ceiling should be.  Obviously.  Amortization.  Boardroom Jimmy, is this merger still baking?  It's not baking.  It's in one bucket with the SEC looking at the whole conglomerate.  It's all about leveraging, Greg.  How leverage?  Yeah, you got to call us by our real names. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, that's true.  Just make it Tony or something, okay?  Mr. Kamiya, do you not understand?  It's all about leveraging.  Yeah?  Yes.  It's got to be.  Of course it is.  If you don't understand what dividend and reinvestment plans are, then you don't belong in this conversation.  I've just leveraged a thousand shares of Sirius. 
[03:52:00]  I've leveraged.  Put them on puts!  I love them.  Can you explain puts?  Yes!  To the land in the right.  There's something you do with stock, which is going to knock the bear market right back to where it belongs.  We have a settlement date, gentlemen.  If your net income doesn't outweigh your profitability, puts are of no value.  Mr. Kamiya, do I have your understanding on this? 
[03:52:30]  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Any questions from you, Gregory?  I think you've said it all.  I'm not going to talk about the EBI, TDA.  What do we have all day about this?  I bet I know what it is, stupid.  You don't think my annual report addressed this?  How do you feel about Mel Karmazi as your CEO there at Boardroom Junior? 
[03:53:00]  Mel Karmazi is an incompetent blunderer.  He has no idea.  He ran Viacom into the ground.  Profitability was up.  Wait.  If it's up, isn't that good?  It certainly is.  Oh, my God.  I specifically drove the stock through insider trading from a small piece to a larger piece  without one-time selling at $42, as I suggested.  Wow.  You do know your stuff.  I certainly do. 
[03:53:30]  And if Mel Karmazi wants to discuss common stock, well, then we can talk about cash flow.  Can't we, Mr. Parsons?  Gregory, please, not now.  I was just going to ask you, are you worried about the SEC?  The SEC can kiss my ball bag.  Insider trading is funny.  What do you think of those apples, Mr. Martin?  SEC and the FCC, same thing to me.  Oh, okay.  Are you going to be ringing the opening bell tomorrow?  Yeah, maybe so if I have a bunch of deferred profit sharings in my asshole. 
[03:54:00]  Deferred profit.  Deferred profit shares are for faggots.  Looks like you have quite the portfolio over there.  I certainly do.  Joint tenants and myself have discussed this.  This deal has long-term gain, gentlemen.  Mr. Karmazi, I say to you, and if you can't divest your portfolio from that, you don't belong in this conversation, sir. 
[03:54:30]  Stop handing me notes for Mr. Bryant.  My throat hurts.  All right.  If you don't understand what outstanding shares are, then I suggest you fuck a baby.  And even if you do understand, fuck it anyway. 
[03:55:00]  People are asking, Boardroom Jimmy, if they should invest in AIDS.  It's trading on the NASDAQ.  I don't get involved in tawdry humor.  No, it's all business with him.  It's all business.  I understand, sir.  No tawdry humor.  I understand.  AIDS is trading low again.  And again.  And again.  And again, right.  All right.  So you got a lot of pie charts in front of you there.  Very impressive.  Of course it is.  All right, here we go. 
[03:55:30]  That composites my ass.  What do you think about NASDAQ?  The tech stocks.  How do you think the future looks in tech stocks?  Bunch of bullshit.  Short-term game, gentlemen.  Short-term game.  Put them all on putsch and sell at $3,484.11.  Not a dime sooner. 
[03:56:00]  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Yeah, someone's suggesting we ought to get the Jim Cramer sound effect.  Yeah.  The bull and the bear growling sound.  All those dumb sound effects.  All those dumb sound effects for when he's talking about the stock.  So when Jimmy goes off like that, you can just hit him.  Because people call up all the time.  Yeah, I went into General Electric many years ago.  I was a good bunch of stock.  And I'm just wondering what your feeling is about GE. 
[03:56:30]  Jimmy?  I didn't hear a word you said.  I was reading the profitability report.  I get profitability reports every hour.  Yeah, as you know, as you obviously know, Ford had a tough year this year and was really down.  Do you think they should jump in and try to maybe take over Chrysler?  I have specifically told both companies, get involved with commodities, gentlemen. 
[03:57:00]  So you're saying an automotive company should get into things like bacon and orange juice?  Of course I am because of fuels and metals and agriculture.  What about textiles?  I don't believe in textiles.  No one's trading them anymore.  You take that to the Nasdaq camp.  Greg from Long Island.  What about the new cell phone, sir?  The new cell phone company, T-Cell. 
[03:57:30]  Oh.  Are they up or down on the Dow today?  You tell T-Cell they're losing shares rapidly.  Invest in broth.  Invest in broth and get that damn Brady spokesman out of there.  He's doing nothing for the company.  I love Jimmy's stock advice.  All right, here we go.  So this is a New York one.  Howard Stern and Oprah Winfrey may soon share the same airwaves as two satellite radio rivals agree to merge.  Sirius and XM announced the deal, which would have both sides, each owning 50% of the combined company. 
[03:58:00]  The two companies also agreed Sirius' CEO.  Mel Karmazin would be the chief executive of the new company.  And XM chairman Gary Parson would remain as chairman.  The deal still needs to be reviewed by federal regulators.  Yeah, so New York one, no mention.  How about the CW here in New York?  Local Channel 11.  Listen to this.  Sirius satellite radio has agreed to buy larger rival XM satellite radio for more than $4.5 billion in stock. 
[03:58:30]  Now, the merger that would combine talent, including Howard Stern, Oprah Winfrey, still faces regulatory approval.  Yeah, right.  Let's keep going.  You get nailed, too.  Fox 5.  Wall Street closed for President's Day, but that did not stop at least one big deal from happening.  XM and Sirius satellite radio hooking up at a $13 billion deal, including about $1.5 billion in debt.  Now, it's going to unite talk show superstar Oprah Winfrey and shock jock Howard Stern.  Media maverick Mel Karmazin will serve as the chief executive of the combined company if, and it's a big if, the deal is approved. 
[03:59:00]  No, it's not a big if.  CBS this morning.  Who wrote the AP story?  That's what you've got to find out.  Oprah does one hour of radio a week.  She doesn't even know she's on XM.  Do you know she records a phone call and hands it in?  That's all, that's, that's, oh, fuck it.  There's some yapping about business.  It looks like they're serious.  Sirius satellite radio and XM satellite radio are merging.  This is an $11 billion deal, and it's a team-up that would give all subscribers access to Howard Stern and Oprah and lots of other entertainers, 
[03:59:30]  but the deal does face some tough scrutiny from regulators.  No, it doesn't.  It's going to go through.  And it was $13 million, not $11 million.  They're getting the fucking wrong numbers.  XM and Sirius are planning to merge.  Jennifer Westhoven's in New York now to talk about what it means for you.  Well, I assume what it means is that that would be the only game in town.  That is one of the things that it might mean.  So you wouldn't have to choose between, say, Oprah Winfrey and all of her friends that have shows and Howard Stern. 
[04:00:00]  Maybe that could have some family harmony between couples.  But at the same time, you know, would the price go up?  They both charge $12.95 right now a month, but if there was no competition, right,  you wouldn't have any choice but to pay for the upgrades if they get that.  Yeah.  And today's show.  Sirius and XM, rival satellite radio companies, are announcing a merger,  following speculation that joining forces is the only way to compete. 
[04:00:30]  Spending millions to attract top talent and secure sports programming,  Sirius and XM have been locked in competition.  Sirius luring Howard Stern with a five-year contract worth $500 million plus bonuses.  XM spending $650 million for the rights to Major League Baseball and more than $50 million for Oprah.  But neither has emerged a winner.  $50 million for Oprah to do an hour.  $50 million for Oprah Winfrey.  An hour a week. 
[04:01:00]  Karmazi will be looking at that deal closely.  $50 fucking million.  Karmazi will be all over that deal.  And Martha Stewart, you think he's going to keep her?  What the fuck does she do?  She's a mullet.  This merger is really Wall Street's way of saying you guys have to quit beating each other up  because it's costing us in the pocketbook and it's costing you in terms of profitability.  If the FCC approves this merger, Sirius' current chief, Mel Karmazin, will be CEO,  while XM's chairman retains his role.  I think the Federal Communications Commission will be watching very carefully 
[04:01:30]  to see the consumers don't get harmed in this process, and it could result in a larger menu.  An internal memo obtained by NBC News reveals the merged company hopes to allow listeners to choose channels  from Martha Stewart Living Radio to Bob Dylan's Theme Time.  It'll likely take nearly a year before this merger is approved, and it's not a done deal.  The biggest hurdle, convincing the FCC that giving one company a monopoly on satellite radio won't be unfair to consumers. 
[04:02:00]  And while giving one company a monopoly on an industry always threatens to hike prices,  this merger could have a real upside for consumers.  Not only will subscribers not have to pick between Howard Stern and Oprah at the two different companies now, 
[04:02:30]  but they may actually be able to pick specific channels.  No one picks between Howard Stern and Oprah, you dumb broad.  Nobody.  Nobody.  No one.  No one has thought, do I want to listen to Howard or Oprah?  Can I get them both?  Ever.  See, you want to like, like, same genre, you dummy.  So it would be Howard or Opie and Anthony, or Oprah and Martha Stewart.  Of course.  Baseball or football.  That's how that shit works, you dope.  They're just dummies. 
[04:03:00]  I hate the media.  It's so, they're just dumb.  They just rip copy and read it.  That's old.  What?  That copy's old.  No, I'm going to read it anyway.  Do you know my girlfriend won't admit that I look like Elvis?  Really?  She won't admit it.  Why, Jimmy?  I don't know.  She's hating the player and the game.  I told her.  Player and the game.  A lot of times I've heard that I look like Elvis, like a younger Elvis, like when he first  came out at Ed Sullivan.  And she just won't acknowledge it. 
[04:03:30]  You are a good actor.  Whatever.  You keep a straight face, I'm staring at you right in the face, and it actually looks  like you believe that.  I'm not saying older Elvis.  That would be stupid mutton.  That would be crazy.  But the young one.  Like when he was first banned for swishy-washing his hips.  Right.  Swishy-washing.  Well, we got to get to our meeting.  All right.  I got to go buy my girlfriend a birthday gift.  Aw.  Do you know how to get there?  Yeah.  Not at all.  All right, we got to do line of the day because we got to get out of here. 
[04:04:00]  I got to buy a birthday gift.  Oh, yeah?  She's nine years old.  Yeah, Uncle Paul?  Yeah.  Yeah?  There's an age difference, but you're only as young as you feel.  I'm 57 years young.  I'm going to be 58 in March.  I busted her when she was four.  Oh, God.  All right, listen.  Why don't we do line of the day?  Do we have to sponsor BodogFight.com today? 
[04:04:30]  Yeah, but just mention that.  Just mention what?  In a general sense.  Right.  What's the website?  BodogFight.com.  BodogFight.com.  Here's the runner-up line of the day.  Please talk to me during a bad market about OPEC.  Here's what I say about OPEC and mergers.  Boardroom Jimmy rules.  Boardroom fucking Jimmy. 
[04:05:00]  And?  I see a lot of pointing going on.  I don't know what's happening.  It's the next one.  Oprah's not on the radio.  What are you doing?  Is that Bill?  What are you, hitting buttons with your elbows?  Could you explain what you did, considering everyone is under a close watch right now?  Yeah, exactly.  What did you do?  Why would you do that?  For second runner-up line of the day. 
[04:05:30]  Well, I have only one runner-up line of the day, and we didn't even point to you yet.  Whose mistake was that?  We had a late edition, so that was...  Late edition.  All right.  All right.  Well, you'll be missed.  Oprah's not on the radio.  It's Oprah's friend.  Who pointed that time?  Don't forget, that's all they know.  A lot of the...  I know.  That's what drives me nuts, Bill.  Seriously.  Oh, boy.  Are you just panicking? 
[04:06:00]  Bill.  Good.  You're sitting in silence.  So?  That's what we decided to do.  Not you, Bill.  You don't make...  Who are you, producer Bill?  Who are you, Bill?  Do you understand sometimes we sit in silence and make everyone really uncomfortable and  go, holy shit, what the fuck's going on?  That's right.  Or maybe we just suck.  Froggy all over again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All the way.  Here's the other runner-up line of the day.  Oprah's not on the radio.  It's Oprah and friends.  Don't forget, that's all they know.  A lot of them is that Oprah and Howard were fighting, because he was having his listeners 
[04:06:30]  actually play together.  Sound of her voice.  That was the APE story.  Trust me.  Mel Karmazzi's going to be looking at some of these deals.  Hold on.  You know what?  I didn't even hear you.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  What you missed was, it was a car crash and a bell all in one.  And the bell wouldn't work.  I think that was hilarious, man.  It was funny.  Well.  I did not hear it when you were doing it.  No, I...  I was worked up about Mel Karmazzi.  My bell didn't work.  Someone had disassembled my bell. 
[04:07:00]  I think it's a conspiracy.  They had disassembled my bell and taken this piece out.  The clanger.  And then put it back together again and left the clanger there.  Now, what the fuck is that about?  Barnacles.  Yeah, I know.  Mm-hmm.  Told you.  Barnacles.  I know.  Barnacles.  Now it works.  All right.  Bodogfight.com sponsors Line of the Day. 
[04:07:30]  Here's today's Line of the Day.  Here comes the Line of the Day.  Just because we can't.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  The flop comes out and there's another jack.  Now you have three jacks.  Right.  I just...  I mumble, one to go.  Yeah. 
[04:08:00]  That was Poker Jimmy.  Yeah.  Poker Jimmy.  Yeah, Poker Jimmy.  You can't even keep track anymore.  You got Poker Jimmy.  You got Boardroom Jimmy.  Man of a Thousand Faces.  You just know so much about everything.  Uncle Paul.  I love it.  Man of a Thousand Faces and no chins.  Boy, with a Thousand Sweetnesses.  Thank you, Heather Graham.  Thank you.  She was wonderful.  What was the movie?  Grey Matter has that really sexy lesbian scene in it.  Her and Tom Cavanaugh, brother and sister, and they're both aiming for the same chick.  I want to jerk off to the synopsis. 
[04:08:30]  We got to be somewhere at 1130.  You get there when you get there.  You're the fucking stars.  Yeah, right.  You make them wait.  Yeah.  What is Tom doing?  Tom.  It's not with Tom.  Oh, all right.  Because he's a fucking Frankenberry hairdo, and it bugs me.  Enough with the braces.  It's just awful.  Either put them on your legs so we can laugh at you, or fuck off.  All right.  You want to meet with the Hollander?  Because I'll talk to him, too, if you want.  No, no.  I'll call him on the phone.  Not that. 
[04:09:00]  You know if you put your finger in my ass right now, you'd hit a duke?  All right.  This is a very special show.  It's about being able to do the show we want to do.  Prison sex.  Give it to me.  We know what guys want to hear on the radio. 
[04:09:30]  Adult-oriented subject matter.  Look at those chunks.  They will exercise restraint.  This is going to be an awful show.  Hold on tight, kid.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.
