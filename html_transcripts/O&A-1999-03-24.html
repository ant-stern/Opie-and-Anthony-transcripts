<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a lively discussion about wet dreams, spurred by listener calls detailing both male and female experiences, including a particularly graphic account from a caller named Phyllis describing an orgasmic wet dream.  This led to a discussion of Kate Moss's nipples as depicted in photographs, before transitioning to a humorous audio clip from a past show about Hillary and Chelsea Clinton's African trip.  The segment included a lesbian wet dream account from another listener and a Priceline.com commercial break, during which the hosts jokingly suggested the company add prostitution to its services.

Following the break, the show received a call from a listener critical of the show's focus on sex and fashion.  The hosts then shifted gears to satirize the recent spate of seemingly theatrical arrests at New York Police Headquarters, mocking the celebrities involved and suggesting the arrests were publicity stunts.  This transitioned into a discussion about sleepwalking and sleep sex, featuring accounts from listeners detailing their own experiences, including one from a caller named Frank.

The hosts then launched into a false report of the arrest of the entire cast of "What's Happening," further mocking the perceived staged nature of celebrity arrests in contrast to genuine acts of civil disobedience.  This led to a prolonged comedic bit mocking Al Sharpton, including a humorous song dedicated to him.  They briefly mentioned a previously interrupted segment with a caller, Yoshi, promoting Chinese Viagra, before moving to a caller named Peter who shared his Viagra experience, which the hosts playfully attributed to the excitement of a new relationship rather than the drug itself.

The segment concluded with a humorous exchange with a persistent listener, Paul, who repeatedly complained about the lack of music and requested specific songs. The hosts teased and mocked Paul's musical preferences, even playing a song ("Love is Like Oxygen" by The Sweet) they believed he would dislike.  They then promoted upcoming show events, played a track from their own CD, and received a call from Donna, who offered to dance naked for them if they changed their playlist.  Despite concerns about the explicit lyrics, they ended the segment playing a Godsmack song.

The show then moved to announcements regarding their upcoming schedule.  They discussed playing another Godsmack song before detailing their plans: Vince McMahon would be a guest the following day to discuss WrestleMania, and a listener contest for the best Opie and Anthony sign at a Raw is War event was announced.  Friday’s show would feature comedian Stephen Lynch and a competition to find a new “hottest girl” to replace Tara, with photo submissions required via PornCity.net due to prior website issues.  The segment ended with a call from a new listener whose recent discovery of the show was met with humorous exasperation from the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNW, the latest from the Goo Goo Dolls.  That's Dizzy from Dizzy of the Girl, and the Goo Goo Dolls playing May 30th at Asbury Park Convention Hall.  Tickets on sale now. It's Opie and Anthony.  The phone lines are jammed with guys with wet dream stories.  Great.  You know, it'll just get ugly if we just continue down this path.  Yeah.  We don't mind continuing down this path, but I don't know if we'll get much accomplished.  First, Chris, through the fax line, suggests that some of the ladies call in with their wet dreams if they have them. 
[00:00:30]  I don't know if it's the same thing.  I don't know. Is there a female equivalent?  I don't know. I'm not a female. You're not a female. Maybe we'll learn something new here.  Is there an orgasmic finish to a girl's version of the wet dream?  Well, if the lady's brave enough to call in, maybe we can find that out, Anthony.  I would like to.  Also, we've got to thank the faithful listeners for sending us the Kate Moss pictures.  Yeah, we finally popped them up.  Yeah, big story in the paper today. Kate Moss's career is in a lot of trouble. 
[00:01:00]  Who was she with? Calvin Klein or whatever?  Yeah.  Was it Calvin Klein?  Yeah.  Well, Klein dropped her, and she's trying to jumpstart a career.  So, for British Vogue, I think, she did a six-page spread, naked photos.  And instead of everyone talking about how hot she is and stuff, the word is that everyone's making fun of her inverted nipple.  All right.  And we got the pictures here, and that's a bizarre nipple right there, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  I'm looking.  Yeah, she has one normal one and one inverted, it looks like, to me.  It kind of looks like a flat tire.  A flat tire.  Like a little flat tire.  Yeah.  So, it's not working.  The other nip looks a little weird, too.  I don't know, but a bunch of guys have called and said that they really dig the inverted nipple look.  Yeah?  Really?  I don't know.  It just makes it look like a big gravy thing. 
[00:02:00]  I'm sorry.  Oh.  She's got tiny nippies.  Yeah.  It's just whatever.  I don't know.  All right.  She was hot for about five minutes.  Also, we're getting a lot of requests.  People want to hear the Hillary and Chelsea bit from yesterday.  Oh, their little trip to Africa.  You want to blow it out here?  Yeah.  We played it pretty late yesterday.  All right.  Kevin's finding it.  There's two of them, Kev.  Yeah.  Very interesting.  We got audio of Hillary and Chelsea in Africa. 
[00:02:30]  They went over there to get, I guess, as far away from Bill Clinton as is humanly possible.  So, they had to go to another continent.  And we have audio of their adventures in the African jungle.  We might not have audio.  Why?  Why?  Where is it?  I can't find it.  Oh, come on.  It's got to be over there.  You got them?  Yeah, we got them.  Yeah.  Bill Clinton's ready to commit forces, if they're not already, to a war in Kosovo. 
[00:03:00]  And she's off gallivanting around the globe.  Right.  And that's nice.  Yeah, don't stay at the White House and, you know, support troops and everybody else.  You know, go gallivant.  Well, we have Phyllis who had a wet dream.  So, now we got to go to the phones.  Oh, I wanted to hear that.  What, this?  Yeah.  Honestly, some people are saying this is the funniest thing we have done.  Wow.  So, if you didn't hear this yesterday, stick around.  We'll get it on very soon.  But I think we got to see what Phyllis is on. 
[00:03:30]  All right.  I want to hear this.  All right.  A little note to the management of N.E.W.  If we're going to start taking more phone calls on our show, we need the buttons, like, right in front of us.  Because this is what happens every day.  Okay, let's talk to Phyllis.  I'm way over here now.  Yeah.  Yeah, you need, like, a phone bank thing over there.  And also, it would be nice to have a screen where it says, like, Phyllis, line one.  Why don't you talk about wet dreams?  Instead of, like, Rick running back and forth like a madman from another room.  Pencil scrap.  Well, maybe the computer that now has the music that's being played. 
[00:04:00]  Maybe that could be used for the phone calls.  That could be transparent.  You know, once, you know, things happen or don't.  I don't know.  Well, that'd be a nice screen to have.  Wouldn't it?  Yeah, look.  It's right there.  The phone calls.  I'm sure they could rewire it.  It doesn't have to show the music.  Instead of just showing the list of tunes we've played thus far?  Yeah.  All right, Phyllis, what do you got?  Hey.  Well, I was driving in the car, going home, and I heard you talking.  I just turned the radio on.  I heard you talking about if it's possible for women to have wet dreams.  And I was saying yes.  It is.  So I said, and I heard you wanted somebody to call. 
[00:04:30]  So I said, let me give it a shot, see if I can get through.  Okay.  Well, first of all, when you had these wet dreams, does it go to completion?  One time it did.  It usually wouldn't because some women need manual stimulation.  Right.  That's what I was wondering.  Which I surprised myself.  Oh, wow.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't say anything.  We had to jump out of the show.  You can't say that word.  You can say I, you can say I, you know, you woke up and said, I can't believe I just completed. 
[00:05:00]  Completed the mission.  Whatever.  You know.  All right, so you had the wet dream to completion.  Completion.  And what was, what was the dream about?  Now, be very careful in your description of the dream.  Oh, you got that right.  Who was the guy or girl?  It was a guy.  Okay.  Was it somebody that you knew or just?  Someone that I knew, yes.  Oh.  Someone you work with?  Um, yes.  Oh, a man of your, are you married?  Yes.  Oh, wow. 
[00:05:30]  Have you been fantasizing about this guy?  I don't.  Well, you know, you fantasize about a lot of different people.  All right.  Sometimes you fantasize somebody will appear in your dream.  Oh, my God, where did that person come from?  You don't expect to have a fantasy about certain people.  You can't control your dreams.  So, it's like a big Jim Slade coming in.  Hey, size doesn't matter.  It's what you do.  All right.  Right?  No.  That's how you work the wand.  I know.  We've heard all those games. 
[00:06:00]  Motion of the ocean.  You can't have white dreams, yes.  All right.  Well, oh, did I say something wrong?  Oh, no.  No, no.  Okay.  But explain, you know, how this dream came about.  Well, I was just, actually, just consummating the act.  All right.  Now, what happened?  Like, what's the setup?  I actually went to completion.  All right.  No, but what's the setup?  All of a sudden, you fell asleep and you're, you know.  I only remember the good parts.  All right.  I don't want to remember.  No, actually, just.  It's like pulling teeth.  Just, uh, just doing something with someone. 
[00:06:30]  Just, uh, making love.  Just making love.  All right.  That's all.  It was just, it wasn't anything exotic or anything like that.  It was just excellent.  I think we forgot about the difference between men and women.  I know.  The guys.  Women will be like, yes, it was a wonderful experience.  No, you're not going to show me anything.  Guys are like, so I take my, all right, all right.  It doesn't matter with guys.  All you have to do is close your eyes.  It really doesn't matter, right?  All right.  Well, we were hoping to hear that you were hanging from a swing.  Oh.  You know, something.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Give us something here.  No, not this time.  Start shaking, maybe.  Right.  But, but it does happen. 
[00:07:00]  Okay.  It does happen.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh.  I was hoping she had some, uh, ability to, uh, relate a story with some details.  That would have been nice.  Eroticism.  All right.  You want to take a break and then we'll get the, the Chelsea and Hillary thing on?  All right.  Let's do that.  Let's do it that way.  Are we running late?  Because if we're running late, then we could just like come out of commercials and go right  into this bit.  Oh, if, if, if we have to, uh, play songs, what, what, which ones, Opie? 
[00:07:30]  Which gems do we not want to skip?  Oh, Gary's back today.  He's going to be all pissed, man.  I know.  All right.  I'm just gone.  Uh, well, um, no, we are running late.  So, okay.  So what we'll do is we'll, uh, we'll come out of spots and we're going to get right into  this, uh, Chelsea and Hillary bit.  If you didn't hear yesterday, trust me, stick around.  It's, uh, it's pretty wacky.  Okay.  All right.  Stay right there.  It's only a few minutes.  Stay.  Well, I got a little of the commercials. 
[00:08:00]  All right, Anthony, Priceline.com.  Our good friends at Priceline.  Yes.  Going to be staying at a hotel.  Hmm.  And, uh, you know, you don't want to pay the price the hotel wants you to pay.  No.  They jack their prices up.  Correct.  What is it?  It's a room for you to stay in.  Mm-hmm.  Some amenities.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, you can name your own price for the same room with Priceline.  Right.  You give them a call, 1-800-Priceline, or you go to the website, Priceline.com.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:08:30]  Name your own price.  Priceline comes back and gives you the price you want.  Within an hour.  No, I was just thinking.  Priceline.com, they're into hotel rooms.  Mm-hmm.  They're into airline tickets.  Mm-hmm.  They're into home mortgages.  Home mortgages?  Yes.  That's great.  When are they going to get into hookers?  Yeah.  I'll shake his hand.  Hookers?  I don't know.  I don't know about that.  They're so damn expensive, Anthony.  So you're saying that it would be good if Priceline, you could call them with the hooker you want to go to. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  And instead of, you know, 50 bucks.  Right.  For some treats.  For some lovin'.  For some lovin'.  For some favors.  Yeah.  You go, I want to pay 35.  Right.  And Priceline comes back with the same hooker.  Yeah.  35 bucks, same favors.  There you go.  Dare to dream.  Opie, dare to dream.  You are the horniest guy in the face of the earth.  It's got to be the stack.  Well, I don't think they're even looking into that as we speak. 
[00:09:30]  But I do know about their hotel rooms and airline tickets and home mortgages, Anthony.  Right.  That's right.  You name your own price.  Priceline comes back with the price you want, not the price that the hotel wants you to pay or the airline wants you to pay.  Well, honestly, we're hearing back from a lot of our faithful listeners that have used the service.  And they're going, guys, this really works.  I've saved a lot of money.  Why wouldn't you do this?  It's the service is free of charge.  Mm-hmm.  And it's easy.  It's quick. 
[00:10:00]  And it's there.  So use it.  Right.  My God, people.  What about name your own price for crank?  Opie, I wouldn't get into that either.  No.  Okay.  But they do a great job with the airline tickets, the hotel rooms, and the mortgages, right?  They're there to serve you.  All right.  We're back.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for sticking with us there.  Want to send faxes into us?  That's cool.  212-957-WNEW.  Here's one from Barbara.  Got to get Barbara on the phone, but she didn't leave any info whatsoever.  Oh, maybe she did.  Maybe we could call this little number at the top. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  Barbara, you forgot to cross that out.  Oh, and hey, hello.  You guys are very funny, and I enjoy your show.  One thing, a woman can have a wet dream.  Also, I have had my share, but one I particularly remember because it was with a woman and not with a male.  I dreamed of being with another woman, and it was very real.  I was touching this very hot woman and was bringing her to a climax when I went in my sleep.  I believe I even cried out after moaning quite loudly.  Wow.  I woke up very satisfied. 
[00:11:00]  One bummer was that I couldn't get back to sleep.  Small price to pay.  Keep doing what you're doing, Barbara.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Call up Barbara.  See if we can get her on the line.  We've got to hear more about that, Jerry.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We promised the Chelsea and Hillary bit.  Yes.  Oh, man.  I think we have to play this one first and that one second.  We've got two episodes here.  Okay.  Yeah, they were recently, I think still are, in Africa, right?  Yeah.  Now they're in North Africa.  Well, they were in Egypt as well.  Okay.  But they're spending like two weeks in the African region. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Okay.  Good.  I never consider Egypt part of Africa myself.  Yes, North Africa.  I know it is, but, you know, it's just Egypt.  Rommel's country back in the big one.  Anyway.  We'll call you Iwachala Kanaya.  Wait.  What does it mean?  That means she who cannot sit for weeks.  Ooh.  Now grab your ankles, Chelsea, and I will demonstrate what your father does to your countrymen.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Put it away.  Put it away.  Whoa.  Wow.  Who knew that was going on over there?  They seem to be having a lot of fun over there now.  Yeah.  Learning the customs of the land.  Yeah.  Very nice.  That's only part one?  Yeah, we got part two now.  Of course we do.  I really like part two myself.  Part two is, oh, you need it.  It ties up all the loose ends.  Of course.  Oh, Mandingo.  It's so big. 
[00:12:30]  I need two hands to hold it.  Oh, that's it, Chelsea.  Now wrap your lips around it.  Wrap like this?  Yes, that's it.  Now blow, Chelsea.  Blow.  Blow.  Nothing's coming out.  Oh, be patient, Chelsea, and blow harder.  Oh.  Bullseye.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wow, thanks for showing me how to use your blow gun, Mandingo.  Anytime, Chelsea.  We best go back to the village and find your mother. 
[00:13:00]  I wonder where she is.  Maybe she's in this hut.  Oh.  Mom, what are you doing with Mandingo's sister?  Oh, dear.  You said you were going on a safari.  No, no.  I said before the day ends, I want to be deep in the bush.  Well, you do what you want.  I'm going to help Mandingo take care of a bad animal.  What are you talking about, Chelsea?  He wants me to spank his monkey.  Well, just be back in time for dinner. 
[00:13:30]  Okay.  Well, what are we having?  I don't know about you, but I'll be having the African beaver.  God.  Wow.  There's just something so wrong about that.  I love that bit.  I love that one, man.  Yeah.  All right.  We better regroup.  All right, man.  Okay.  African beaver. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, my goodness.  Fax line 212-957-WNEW.  You can get a hold of us through the phone lines, or you can use the instant feedback if you're online right now.  Just go to the WNEW website.  Click on our pictures, and there's an area there where you can send an email to us right here in the studio.  We read it, you know, immediately.  Man, she's constantly, constantly yelling at me about these F-me dreams that I'm constantly having. 
[00:14:30]  She says, I'm always saying it in the middle of the night in my sleep.  I wake her up with them.  I'm rubbing up against her.  I don't remember her.  I wake up in the morning, no memory whatsoever.  I wake up with wood, but no memory of the dream at all.  I don't know what to tell you guys.  True fact.  No, don't remember the dreams.  I have no clue what's going on in them.  All I know is I wake up in the morning, I'm in the doghouse with my girlfriend.  I hear Anthony laughing back there.  I know that laugh.  I listen to you guys on the radio show.  I know.  You really wouldn't want that on the air, because you'd probably get in trouble for even telling us, right? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  No, man.  You guys put it on the air.  I don't get in trouble.  All right.  It's all good.  Well, keep listening.  We'll probably put that on the air.  I guarantee you I will keep listening, even if you don't put me on the air.  You guys just do too funny.  All right, Frank.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  Thanks.  Take it, man.  I was hoping he was going to say something stupid.  We didn't get him, though.  Nah.  We tried.  All right.  More stupidity on the way.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Tom Petty's latest free girl now from Echo.  That's in stores.  And Mata Hoople before that. 
[00:15:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  This just in.  The entire cast of What's Happening just got arrested down at police headquarters.  Come on.  That's not true.  Well, I looked on the TV.  I looked on the TV, and that's what it looks like to me.  We're here.  Police headquarters.  The entire cast of What's Happening arrested.  Dwayne's comment was, hey, hey, hey.  And rerun did a dance.  Well, every day, you know, there's people getting arrested. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, Raj, I told you you was going to get arrested.  Shut up, D.  Yeah, that seems to be a good move.  Way to get some publicity.  Way to get your face in the press again.  I mean, obviously, there are people who are sincere about the cause that want to go down there and be arrested.  But I think it's starting to get to be where some people are getting down there.  You know, there are people in entertainment get desperate.  They want to go down and perk their career up. 
[00:16:30]  Well, Webster is trying to get arrested every day, but no one can see him.  But I'm keeping track of all the arrests.  It looks like everyone that has ever appeared in a Spike Lee movie has been arrested, Anthony.  Oh, really?  The entire cast of The Jeffersons, Good Times, and now today, what's happening?  All arrested.  All arrested.  And the cast of Different Strokes already got time served.  Right.  So they didn't even have to go down there, but they get credit for it.  Yeah.  I mean, does anyone else see how stupid these arrests are? 
[00:17:00]  I mean, it's a heavy subject.  I don't even want to get into it.  I got my own opinions about it.  Yeah.  But I think how people are going about it and getting arrested, it's just stupid.  Absolutely stupid.  That seems to be what the people are doing.  Well, let me explain, because I'm just throwing that out.  It's like people go, duh.  All right.  It's choreographed every day.  Yeah.  Big ass Reverend Al Sharpton stands there, and he lines the people up, right?  Mm-hmm.  It's almost like they're on a red carpet outside the Oscars or something. 
[00:17:30]  I'm just waiting for Joan Rivers to ask what they're wearing and stuff.  It's going to turn into that.  Like, there's going to be paparazzi with the red carpet and people waving, you know,  hey, Spike, Spike, turn around.  Yeah.  And they turn around, getting arrested.  It's just all choreographed.  If you see it on the news at all, they're all lining up, and then Reverend Al gives the sign,  and they get arrested.  Right.  And we brought up this point, I think, last week on the show.  If you're going to get arrested for your cause, get arrested.  Do something good. 
[00:18:00]  Spend some time.  Right.  Do something sick.  I don't even think they see cell time.  They go in with the plastic handcuffs on, and they fill out some paperwork, and then they're out.  They're released five minutes later, pretty much.  They're not getting the plunger in the keister.  No.  No.  I mean, I think we should go down there with some Uzis.  We go down with Uzis and really get arrested on a weapons charge.  Yeah.  And then we get arrested.  They throw us in Rikers or something.  We're like, what?  I thought we were just getting arrested like everyone else.  Yeah, what happened?  Why do I get the steel handcuffs and the shackles?  Right.  I saw on TV how everyone's just getting arrested. 
[00:18:30]  I figured I'd join the protest.  What?  What?  Isn't everyone else coming down here with loaded weapons and stuff?  You know?  I hear you.  Don't be a...  We call them puss arrests.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  They put the plastic handcuffs on you.  You're in the precinct for five minutes, and they let you go, and then, ooh, ooh, your picture's  all over the paper.  You're just radical.  You're just out of control.  It kind of takes away from the arrest.  I mean, the old days of civil disobedience back in the 60s, when they got arrested, they  got arrested. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  I mean, that was it.  Yeah.  You were getting locked up.  You were probably spending at least a night in there, in the real jail.  Mm-hmm.  Not, you know, this ceremonial, I have been arrested.  Right.  Wait a minute.  You just got let in.  They're putting a revolving arrest door.  Yeah.  At the New York police headquarters.  Where you go in one side, and you revolve out the other, and you have technically been  arrested.  Yeah.  I think the cops down there must be just looking at this like, this is such a joke.  Like, oh, my God.  We could be out fighting crime and doing other stuff for society, and we have to sit here  and arrest people. 
[00:19:30]  You know?  Yeah.  Heavy cause, and I understand that.  Yeah.  If you really believe in this cause, go down there and openly sell crack in front of police  headquarters.  Well, let's see people that...  Go out in a blaze of glory.  People that are going down there that really mean that they are sincere about the cause that  they believe in, or people just trying to get publicity.  Mm-hmm.  All right?  Somebody like Ozzie Davis, who was down there.  Mm-hmm.  Do you think he was for the cause?  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  He's a pretty heavy dude.  Pretty heavy duty.  In the community.  Now, what about, I saw Venus Flytrap from WKRP in Cincinnati down there.  Well, I would have to...  I think maybe he's doing it for the publicity, Anthony.  Yeah, I would think definitely publicity.  Okay.  All right.  How about, obviously, the Reverend Al down there every day?  He's got his cause.  He's there.  Now, you see someone like Isaac from the Love Boat down there preaching the cause.  I can't...  I think he's there to boost his career.  Yeah, you may be right on that one, Anthony. 
[00:20:30]  Mm-hmm.  How about, um...  How about Walona from Good Times?  Walona from Good Times.  Um...  Yeah, I think she's looking for some publicity as well.  Publicity.  Yeah.  Definitely.  What if, uh, like they say, Bill Cosby might show up?  That's a tough one.  I could go either way.  Well, he's got his career on TV.  Yeah.  Going, and, uh...  That's what's just making this all just a joke at this point.  Yeah.  It's in the paper.  Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey are thinking about getting arrested, arrested along with Mayor 
[00:21:00]  Koch.  Oh.  Wow.  Like the cause is going to spend some hard time in Rikers or somewhere else.  The cause is going down for the cause.  The cause for the cause, you see.  Me and Camille are going to what I like to call Jell-O.  We're going to the police headquarters to get the goofy plastic handcuffs and go to Jell-O.  It's not real jail.  It's Jell-O.  It's soft and sweet and Jell-O. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  The cause is there for the cause.  You know, and...  The cause for the cause.  The cause.  Come on.  Come on.  So, so he's going to get arrested.  He'll be all over the papers all over America.  Hmm.  And it's another one of these puss arrests.  No, the cause wants to become a jailhouse bitch.  Yeah.  For the cause.  You see, I want to go to Rikers and be the queen of the weight room prom, you see. 
[00:22:00]  Me and Camille.  Well, Mr. Cosby, if you really believe in this cause, why don't you go down there and do  some pimping?  I'll do some pimping.  Remember, I used to look on I Spy.  Yeah.  I used to undercover go as the pimp with the big hat and the floppy.  Ooh, you know.  Going to Jell-O.  I'm going to be tossing some salad in Jell-O.  Because pimping ain't easy.  Pimping ain't easy when you're the cause in the Jell-O.  Wow.  So the cause, I would say, is there for the cause? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, of course there for the cause.  Now, what if you see Freddie Boom Boom Washington down there?  Wow, he needs the publicity.  Have you seen his ridiculous commercial?  Did you see that?  Not to go off on a tangent, but what happened to Boom Boom Washington?  I saw this commercial.  He's singing, who's that lady?  Who's that lady?  For two, not even a split second, he's on the screen.  Yeah.  In the background.  I'm like, hey, hey, Freddie Boom Boom Washington.  Look, it's Freddie Boom Boom Washington.  Mm-hmm.  So you got John Travolta making loads of cash. 
[00:23:00]  He started off as a sweat hog on Welcome Back Cotter.  Right.  So did Freddie Boom Boom Washington.  Mm-hmm.  Let's see, who's doing better?  Mm-hmm.  What?  What?  Yeah.  Even Arnold Horshack's doing better than me.  Oh!  Boom, boom.  I heard Arnold Horshack got put on blackface and went down there to try to get arrested,  but he can't even get arrested.  Oh, no?  No.  Hey, this isn't a white-black issue, Anthony.  A lot of white people are getting arrested as well.  I see that.  Okay.  They're right there at police headquarters. 
[00:23:30]  So when do we, should we try to get arrested?  Like, would that be cool and stuff?  Um, no thanks, Sophie.  No?  I shan't be getting arrested.  Because I think if you're goofing on their arresting down there, you will get beat up.  That's what I'm guessing.  Hey, Brett, what do you got?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You guys hear about Reverend Al Sharpton?  Is Michael on a hunger strike?  Yeah.  I mean, I think I threw this fat ass some good.  Yeah, that's not a hunger strike.  That's just a diet.  Reverend Al.  I hear ya. 
[00:24:00]  I'm going on a diet for the car!  I mean...  I won't eat anything but ho-ho's, ring-dings, yodels, twinkies, and a devil dog.  I will not eat celery or carrots until this injustice is resolved.  I hear you guys.  You might lose one chin instead of three.  All right, Brett.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Should we leave this little section with the Reverend Al song? 
[00:24:30]  We haven't played it in a while.  Yeah, I love the Reverend Al song.  He's in the news every day.  All right, let's play Reverend Al, and then we'll take a little musical break.  We'll play some Judas Priest.  We've got Johnny Lang on the way and more of your phone calls.  Stay right there.  What happened?  Oh, the bit wasn't cued up.  Are you kidding?  What the hell's wrong with this?  How could it not be cued up?  Was it played during our absence on Monday?  No?  No.  Can't blame anyone?  I heard the Yoshi bit gets stopped right in the middle on Monday. 
[00:25:00]  Why don't you explain that while this queues up?  Yeah, I'm driving back from Massachusetts, and I'm listening to the Opie and Anthony wacky bits,  seeing what it's like to sit in the car and listen.  So I'm listening to the Yoshi bit when he's talking about the Viagra, and it got to about  the middle of the bit where we're trying to get the ingredients to the Chinese Viagra  out of Yoshi.  Yeah.  And Yoshi doesn't want to tell.  Right.  So then he goes, I tell you a secret. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  I tell you, come here.  Right, right.  So it got real low.  Right.  And at the point it gets low, Q-N-E-W.  Just ended right there.  And that's where the punchline was, the whole pork thing.  He comes out and yells, pork!  Yeah.  Pork!  I can't do it like him, but yeah, it's like, you know, pork!  Pork!  However he does it.  Right.  But it just ended right there in the middle.  You know, we're going to have to play that bit today.  Yeah.  Because I think we left people with, you know, they weren't satisfied.  Hi, N-E-W.  What do you got?  All right. 
[00:26:00]  You're not going to like this call.  All you guys do is sex.  Sex and fashion.  That's right.  All you guys do now is sex shows.  You have no brain.  Naked women.  And cows.  Because you've got no real comics.  All right.  Okay.  So I don't listen to you guys anymore.  I turn the music on.  Oh, shut up.  Good.  Then don't listen, jackass.  You're the jackass.  Dude, you listen every day.  I guarantee.  I don't listen to you guys.  I guarantee you listen to us every day.  You knew exactly what our points were on this whole Diallo thing.  So you listen every day. 
[00:26:30]  No, I heard that day and I heard you, baby.  Oh, you just happened to hear that one break.  You listen every day.  No, no, no.  I do.  You know how I listen?  I listen because I keep.  Do you got to put another dime in?  He's gone.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Look, he got me all worked up.  He got me all worked up.  You know, we understand there was a grave tragedy that happened.  But when you take it to the length that, yeah, some cops made mistakes, it doesn't mean that the entire NYPD is goose stepping its way down to your house to rouse you out of bed. 
[00:27:00]  They're not all of a sudden now Nazis.  This is what the left wing side of society thinks.  Now, I'm not saying that the cops are all angels.  Don't have me pegged as I love this guy.  I'm a Republican.  I'm not a Republican.  I'm an American.  I'm a human being on the face of this earth. 
[00:27:30]  I don't have agendas like that.  My God.  I could have an opinion that seems very liberal to some people and then other ones that seem very conservative.  So don't lump me in.  These people love lumping you in.  Liberals.  Don't eat meat.  Hug a tree.  The cops are all assholes.  They're out to kill you.  Jesus.  Guy got me riled.  We need a good fart joke.  My Lord. 
[00:28:00]  That was too heavy.  There you go.  That's our political commentary for the day.  Hope you like it.  Well, let's do our next break on Kosovo.  That should be a fun break.  Kosovo.  That should be fun as well.  At war.  All right.  Well, let's take a little break.  Here's how.  Classes are forming in Presiponi and Hackettstown now.  That's 1-877-HERE'S-HOW.  Man, what the hell happened to our show today?  What the hell happened to our show today?  Well, started out with wet dreams and now look where we are. 
[00:28:30]  We got into a heated political debate.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  About everything I just said before?  I could be wrong.  Or not.  Well, that's why we like to say you never know what you're going to hear when you listen  to O-B-N-A.  It's an open forum.  Yeah.  All right.  A little music to calm everyone down.  Phones are going nuts.  I don't really feel like spending the next hour and a half discussing this. 
[00:29:00]  Schween jokes or politics.  That's what you get here.  That's our motto?  I don't think so.  If you've got anything else to talk about, we'd love to hear.  Yoshi, the pork man.  He's giving us a little info on the Chinese Viagra.  Where's Anthony?  There you have it.  But right when Yoshi started whispering, the secret ingredient, that's when all of a sudden,  if you were listening Monday, you heard, P-N-E-W.  And I was at home.  I wanted to throw the PlayStation through the window again. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, I was driving.  I was just like, what?  But there's the pork line.  Yeah.  There's plenty of times where we're not funny.  You know, but that's a time that you should have laughed if you liked the show.  You know what I mean?  Well, there you go.  There's enough opportunities for us to screw up on our own.  Yes.  Hey, Peter.  Opie, Anthony, let me ask you, have you tried this Viagra stuff? 
[00:30:00]  No, but after reading the article about Hugh Hefner and, what was it, Playboy or Maxim?  I don't know.  What was I reading, Maxim Magazine with Hugh Hefner?  He's taking Viagra, right?  Yeah, he says this stuff is great, that everyone should take it as a recreational drug.  Well, let me tell you, taking it from a 22-year-old guy who has absolutely no problems,  I was able to get my hands on some over the weekend, incredible.  My name is Peter.  I felt like Peter North, I'll tell you that.  I was out of control five times in two hours, guys. 
[00:30:30]  No kidding.  No, from what they were saying, they said that it doesn't affect people that are working normally.  Well, maybe it's a placebo effect, but I'll tell you something, it was working.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Interesting.  You know, to get that stack or two stuff, take some Viagra.  Well, take them both.  So, why did you decide to take it?  Actually, just because one of my friends, actually, he has a little problem, so he was able to get a prescription for it.  And then he said to me, he goes, oh, all of a sudden, I'm a champ. 
[00:31:00]  I'm like a porn star here.  So, he told me to try it, and I did.  You know, I'm going to maybe try some more.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  So, I've got to give it a full endorsement.  And what did the girl think?  She was shocked, you know, because usually I'm one or two times, and boom, off to sleep, we're grabbing a beer, you know?  Yeah.  Now, in between sessions, we've got to talk carefully here.  Right.  Did it go south?  Somewhat, but not full.  So, it pretty much stayed...  You're right.  It stayed in the neighborhood, you know? 
[00:31:30]  How long have you been with your girl?  That's the other thing.  It's only been about a month, so maybe that's it, too.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  And how long have you been sexually active with her?  Three weeks.  Come on, girl.  You idiot.  That's what it is.  Now, come on.  You guys are laughing out there now.  Come on.  When you get a new girlfriend, that's just sex with a new girl.  Right.  That has nothing to do with a pill.  It has...  Oh.  You guys... 
[00:32:00]  Get out of here.  You could have taken a Tic Tac, and it would have been the same thing.  I don't care how...  Oh.  Three weeks.  Three weeks.  You're still like...  You can't even remember what she looks like when she's away.  Right.  You're still having sex in every room and every...  On the staircase, on the washing machine.  That's all the excitement of a new relationship, you idiot.  Oh.  I could be popping Pez.  That's not Viagra.  Oh.  I don't care how...  You know, how much you are in love with your significant other. 
[00:32:30]  I mean, you know, the sex drops a little bit.  Yeah.  The longer you're with someone.  I mean, the first few weeks, you could do it anytime, anywhere.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  That's funny, Viagra.  I used to do it on the roof, and now I'm, like, just praying to get a little something  every...  I'll tell you what, I'll try it again in another month, and I'll call you and let you know  how it was.  Yeah, you'd do that.  Oh, man, we thought you were onto something.  That's like taking a cold medication, when you don't have a cold, and going, but this  stuff works great! 
[00:33:00]  My nose, I can breathe fine!  I've been silly guys, five times, you know?  Well, yeah, but you're with the new girl.  I know.  You know what I mean?  You got to agree with us there.  I do.  Call us back in 15 years, if you're with the same girl.  Let us know how that Viagra's working.  All right, that's that guy before.  All right.  All right, let's...  Thanks.  That's funny.  Paul.  Yo.  What's up?  Oh, I don't know.  I want to know if I can get a chance to either talk to Tweedledum and Tweedledum, or just  to have somebody let them know that it's a music station. 
[00:33:30]  Hey, Paul.  Shut up and play the music station.  Oh, this guy again.  Paul, we already made fun of you.  Yeah.  Why are you calling...  Made fun of me?  Yeah.  Duh?  You don't even...  I just call...  Remember the Tweedledum and Tweedledum are line.  And we remember you from your previous call.  Yeah, well, I knew you were busted by balls.  I was...  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to say that on the radio.  Hey, Paul.  We're still talking a lot, and you're still listening.  Yeah.  Well, no.  I keep trying to play the music.  You guys are good DJs when you want to be.  Just play some tunes once in a while.  You had this whole complaint two weeks ago.  I got it right here in front of me.  I still got it, brother. 
[00:34:00]  I mean, sometimes you guys are funny, but you don't play some tunes, man.  This guy's so into the tunes.  Remember this guy, like, in high school that was so into the tunes?  Yeah.  Because it was like the tunes that took you.  You're like, dude, get out of your car for a minute.  No.  So, you know, they got me in that old bag, Scott, which was pretty cool.  He was a lame-o.  Listen, figure it out.  We're going to do what we want around here.  Well, I hope so, but I hope you know, dig some input.  How about this, then?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What song do you desperately need to hear right now? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Right now, I'm, gee, off the top of my head, I'll set up for Love is Like Oxygen by The Sweet.  How's that?  Man.  What?  Homo.  What?  Oh, my God.  Love is like...  Love is like...  Love is like...  That's not old school.  That's homo school.  Oh, y'all come on.  Love is like oxygen.  You could have picked any song in the world, and you're picking Love is Like Oxygen?  Well, everything...  What do you want to hear?  Do you think I'm sexy, too?  Do you dance around your one-room apartment with a little whistle to go and tweet, tweet?  No, stop it.  Who am I? 
[00:35:00]  Wanted up the B-52s?  Get out of here.  I don't know, man.  What kind of...  Love is like...  I thought at least he was going to go, Bad Coe from Bad Coe off of Bad Coe.  Yeah, something.  Bad Coe I saw 20 years ago.  You could have picked any song, and you picked Sweet Love is Like Oxygen?  What do you want me to pick?  Cat Scratch Fever?  I'm getting it.  It's something that rocks.  That would have been much better.  Stranglehold would have worked, but Love is Like Oxygen.  What guy would ever admit that they like this song? 
[00:35:30]  Dude, come on.  We'll follow the rock and roll, brother.  You know, we all have those songs we hear in the car, and we're just glad that no one's  around as we crank it up and go, wow, this is pretty cool, but if my friends heard me  singing to this, they would laugh at me.  Yeah.  If people can play that nonsense rock music with no music, there's nothing to matter  with the sweet, brother.  You know what I mean?  I don't listen to that.  Hey, does this make you hot?  What?  You want a boy?  Yeah.  Hey, this must make you really hot, man.  Why don't you dance around in your apartment with your little satin undies? 
[00:36:00]  Oh, goodness gracious.  You guys are cool, man.  You guys are going to take each other's booze and a joke, dude.  Shut up.  We're playing a song for you.  I know this makes you hot, man.  This is your type of music.  Come on.  I'm going to listen to my radio when I talk to you guys.  Should I turn off my radio?  Come on.  Sing along with this fave.  Yeah.  This sounds like it's right up your alley.  No pun intended.  Well, I hope you can hear some music.  I'll put a front of you, brother.  You say, can't be safe.  Yeah.  You like that?  I can't hear it.  Maybe we could play Dancing Queen by Abba for you. 
[00:36:30]  No, no, no.  Yo, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Just hold your cross-down horses.  Abba.  Do I seem like a twinkie to you or something?  Yeah.  To tell you the truth, when you request love is like oxygen.  You're a rope swallower.  So now cut that out.  Hey, give me that sweet song.  You're a butler.  Give me that sweet song.  I want to see how this guy gets all turned on by sweet.  See how gay this song is.  How about Fox on the Run?  Is that a little better?  Fox on the Run's a little better.  We'll play Fox on the Run by this song. 
[00:37:00]  I wouldn't go out of my way to call a radio station to request Fox on the Run.  I didn't call to request a song.  I just requested any music.  I don't care if it's like a kid scratching a blackboard.  Just anything's better than you, dude.  This guy doesn't like us.  But he listens every...  He calls every day.  Every two weeks.  Every two weeks.  And you're still listening.  So there's something about us that you can't get away from.  Yeah, I try to get in between.  I mean, you guys have the best radio library in the friggin' world.  You guys got a massive cool library.  Yeah, it's going to leave a lot of room when it's pulled out of here on the hand trucks. 
[00:37:30]  These stuff like that's funny.  Do funny crap.  Not that they do it.  You say these guys trying to talk English?  Give me a break.  That's funny stuff, man.  It's funny listening to you trying to speak English.  You're right.  I'll tell you the truth, buddy.  You're right.  I don't speak good English.  You know how much?  All right, listen.  We're going to make your day.  We're going to play a little of this for you.  I hope you get all turned on.  All right, God bless you.  Oh, wow.  Listen to this.  Come on, man.  I can hear you. 
[00:38:00]  Where does this song really make you hot?  Well, I don't know what language I can use on the radio, but back in those days when  I was like road food for them, I used to get a lot of morals, so to speak.  So that's cool.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, rock.  Yeah, listen to that.  Come on, man.  This is what it's all about right here.  I can't hear you.  I don't got my radio on.  Tonight on Don Kirshner's rock concert.  Don Kirshner.  Gee, what?  He's older than God.  Come on, bud.  I can hear you.  Come on.  What's the matter with you guys?  Listen to this.  Oh, dude. 
[00:38:30]  This is like, I don't know.  Hey, while you guys are playing backdoor music.  Backdoor music.  That was the sweet, too.  You guys used to play ballroom bliss.  So don't bust my quinkies.  All right.  I think we've had enough of you.  Yeah.  Peace.  Yeah.  Do you want to replay the last time he called?  Is that necessary?  Yeah.  Because this guy won't go away, man.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, the latest from Collective Soul.  That's heavy. 
[00:39:00]  Off dosage.  Those guys are supposed to come in and say hi to us.  Yeah.  I believe that's still on later on this month.  March almost over.  Yes.  Yes.  Almost springtime weather.  Thank you.  Stating the obvious.  Well, I'm just saying that because we have something planned for spring.  Yes, we do.  Mm-hmm.  It's going to make the Tuesday Night Hummer Club look like a joke.  Yeah.  Something nice for the drive home. 
[00:39:30]  We should have been fired for this thing.  We were able to skate by the last time we did this.  It got close.  Yes.  It got close.  We couldn't do it when the weather was nice when we first got here.  No.  Because you've got to kind of get to know us first.  Yes.  Yeah.  So that's going to, this new thing will happen soon, right, Anthony?  Yes.  I think on the first really nice Wednesday that happens from right now.  I mean, today is Wednesday.  Yeah, but if it was a nice day, we would have broke out our new promotion. 
[00:40:00]  Yes.  The new Opie and Anthony promotion.  The first nice Wednesday, warm temperatures.  You just know when you walk outside and you go, ah, it smells like spring.  Yes.  You know that day?  Yeah.  When that's a Wednesday, make sure you listen to us.  You'll listen.  And people will call, I know, going, hey, it's Wednesday and look, it's a nice day.  What is it?  No, it's got to be that, ah, it's spring.  You will know.  Nice, yeah.  You will know, my son.  Mm-hmm.  And you will see.  Hmm.  Is that all we could say about that?  Yeah.  We don't want somebody else jumping on it. 
[00:40:30]  Ah.  Some wacky DJ.  Ho, ho, ho.  Hey, hey.  Yeah.  But we haven't come up with an original idea ourselves.  According to a lot of new listeners, so.  Ah, Collective Soul, April 2nd, Tradewinds, Seabright, a New Jersey ticket's on sale now  as well for that.  Okay.  Hey, where's your song that you were going to play today?  Remember you were going to defy a playlist and play a song?  Um, yeah, but we need the radio edit.  Oh.  That's the only problem. 
[00:41:00]  I got, I got the whole CD in the car, but, uh, there's too many F's and S's and a lot of  curses.  I'm talking about Godsmack.  Yeah.  My favorite song out right now is, uh, Godsmack.  Yeah.  And the song is called Whatever.  Ah, it kicks ass.  Yeah.  But see if we play it, then we'll have to break stuff in the studio and then.  Yeah.  You know, we kind of get, uh, caught up in the moment.  Yeah.  We kind of do.  The rockin' songs.  So.  All right.  Uh, you know what I want to play really fast? 
[00:41:30]  Because it's kind of frustrating for us.  We have a CD out that, uh, no one could find.  That's why we don't even really talk about it anymore.  It's our record company pretty much let us down when we moved to New York.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, we really don't have anyone listening to us, so they figure they didn't really need  to work the CD.  Today we've sold, I think, uh, 200 copies in New York, which is pretty sad considering  we've sold over 40,000 of the CD everywhere else.  Well, you don't want to saturate the New York market. 
[00:42:00]  No, of course not.  Uh, 200, that's, that's plenty.  So, no.  So, I don't know.  We should give out the phone.  Hold on.  Let me do this.  Give out the phone number for what?  I'm, because there's a lot of people that want our CD in it.  Yeah.  All right.  Get a pen and pencil.  Pen and pencil.  Get a pen and piece of paper.  We're going to piss off our so-called record company that we haven't heard from in months.  Okay.  If you want our Demented World CD, write this number down. 
[00:42:30]  I'm totally serious.  And ask them to send you one.  It's our record company.  Uh, 973.  973.  571.  571.  9444.  9444.  Uh, they're not in the office anymore.  They only work about 15 minutes a day.  So, try them tomorrow.  And ask for Mark Curdo.  Mark Curdo.  And say, look, I've been looking for the Opie and Anthony Demented World CD. 
[00:43:00]  I've given up trying to find it.  Can you send me one?  Hmm.  That ought to get him.  I'm serious.  Okay.  I want the phone to ring all day tomorrow.  973.  571.  9444.  If you want Opie and Anthony's Demented World CD.  Okay.  Good.  And ask for Mark Curdo.  We're very proud of, uh, the CD.  We're ready to make another one, to be honest with you.  That's going to be.  Yeah.  In the works.  Where we're already having meetings.  Yes.  Those wonderful meetings. 
[00:43:30]  Yes.  But, uh, we're definitely proud of the Demented World CD.  Yeah.  But the next one we put out is going to blow that away.  Mm-hmm.  But if you're looking for that, uh, we have the number here.  Rick will give it to you if you weren't able to jot it down.  Yes.  But, uh, one of the tracks from Demented World is being, uh, emailed to us all the time.  And people are like, well, they don't realize it's us.  Yeah.  If you've gotten a hundred grand wave file, that's us.  It's making the rounds now on emails, yeah.  I get it emailed to our email address probably five times a day. 
[00:44:00]  It's like, dude, check this out.  It's really funny.  Maybe you can use it.  Yeah, because if you're, like, internet savvy, you know, some of these really cool things  like the Mentos video that we had on our site for a while.  You know, when something cool hits out there, you want to, you know, turn everyone on to it.  Yeah.  And we're kind of flattered that the hundred grand is making its rounds all over the world  because the internet's the world.  It's a guy getting really, really pissed off because he thought he won a contest.  He thought he won a hundred grand.  Right.  And it didn't turn out that way.  And I just want to play it for people because we do have a lot of new listeners listening 
[00:44:30]  to us lately.  Mm-hmm.  And I just want to let you know this is our bit from Demander World that you may have  had sent to you in the recent past.  Okay.  All right.  Check it out.  Man, the CD is, the player is not queuing up anything today.  Oh.  That's a hundred grand.  Yeah, a hundred grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  Oh, you guys are a bunch of dudes.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! 
[00:45:00]  Congratulations, man!  Uh-oh.  He just pissed.  I love that one, man.  Oh, that's one of our faves of all time.  You guys are a bunch of dudes faves!  You know, we've done hundreds and hundreds of vets.  That's got to be one of our top faves.  I like that one.  We love that one.  So if you've had that email to you, that's our little ditty.  Donna's on the phone here.  Donna?  She's got a proposition for us.  Donna!  Yeah?  What's up?  Hi, who's this?  L.P. and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  They put me through.  Hell, yeah.  Hello, guys. 
[00:45:30]  Hi.  We try to talk to everyone.  Oh, okay.  I was just calling because I told him that I love you guys.  You guys are great.  Don't listen to what all those people tell you on those women's lip crap.  Ignore all that.  Okay.  I've got one request for you guys.  Yeah.  I will dance around naked for both of you if you would just please do this.  Uh-oh.  Stop playing the same three songs every day.  That Everlast song?  Yeah.  It's got to go.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  I have a gun in my mouth.  I'm ready to kill myself if I hear it.  Hold on there, Nellie. 
[00:46:00]  Well, I heard you'll dance naked for us if we just stop playing music altogether.  Um, no.  No, no, no.  I want the music because then it could give me something good to grind to for you guys.  Oh, okay.  But not Metallica, not that same, what's that remake song?  Uh, Whiskey in the Jarrow.  Oh.  That one and the other one, On the Road Again.  Oh, On the Road Again.  God, please don't play that anymore.  On the Road Again.  I just can't wait to get on the road again.  Not that one.  No, of course not that one.  I think Metallica is going to redo Love is Like Oxygen. 
[00:46:30]  Love is Like Oxygen.  Is it going to play Metallica?  You get too much, you get too hair.  But please, please, guys, get them Creed songs.  All right, all right.  Wow, she's demanding now.  But if you dance naked, that's fine.  I will dance naked for you guys.  I'll even get some lesbo action in for you if that's what you want.  All right.  Thanks, Donna.  All right.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Well, you know what?  We just don't talk a big game.  We also come through here.  I've been talking about my favorite song on the radio these days. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  And instead of just wimping out and playing like, you know, I don't know, an old tired heart song,  come on.  Why not?  I understand.  Believe me.  Ralph, the boss will leave, right?  He's walked out.  He's out.  All right.  Break it out.  Notice we waited for the boss to leave.  That's how brave we really are.  Well, you don't want him shutting us all off.  Well, I just want to turn people on to my favorite song on the radio these days.  This is a good one.  This is really good.  You're going to want to crank it up.  It's going to shock a lot of people because it's not like what you're used to hearing 
[00:47:30]  at N.E.W.  This is not what I am used to.  Right.  But, you know, I just want to play this nice and loud for you.  That's right.  It's Godsmack.  Godsmack.  Honestly, God, this is my favorite song on the radio these days.  Unfortunately, we're not playing this.  Yeah.  I don't even think anyone in New York's playing it.  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice getting a fix of that, huh?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I just kicked a hole in the wall. 
[00:48:00]  You're throwing things.  Oh, I needed to hear that today.  I just needed to get it out.  That's my favorite song on the radio these days.  That'll shake some people up.  Thank you, Andrea, for letting us, you know, play that.  Godsmack, whatever.  Tomorrow, we'll play Anthony's favorite song on the radio.  Yeah.  Rob Zombie, Living Dead Girl.  That's a good one, too.  Yeah, I love that one.  The video is creepy for it when they show it on MTV, you know, in between raps and  Jesse promotions.  That just felt good. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  It was different.  I know.  You looked at your dial going, what the hell is going on, man?  What is that?  All right.  So, Pete and Anthony, I'm back to the tunes here.  We'll take a little music break.  I'm just going to play this song so I can hurt myself.  Wait a minute.  Why?  Why?  Why?  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Lenny Kravitz, fly away and heart before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  How are you, bro?  Good, good. 
[00:49:00]  Got to remind people, lots to do still this week on the opening.  Opening.  Opening.  Opening.  I love when we get this called.  Hey, is this the opening and Anthony show?  It's not really a thing that rolls off the tongue like the Zippy and Drippy show or something.  Hey, it's Zippy and Drippy with you.  Or, ah, Sticks Franklin.  But tomorrow, don't forget, we got Vince McMahon coming in.  Yeah.  He's going to be on the phone, actually, right?  On the phone?  Yeah, because he's getting ready for it.  I would have liked to have had him in the studio. 
[00:49:30]  He wanted to come here, but he's really busy because WrestleMania is Sunday.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, I'm definitely getting.  Oh, we got to get it.  Sure.  Have a little WrestleMania party.  But we'll be talking to Vince McMahon from the WWF tomorrow.  Vince, ask him if he's going to have a fisting match.  Yeah, we'll talk to him about that.  In WrestleMania.  Very excited.  That'll be in the 5 o'clock hour tomorrow, I believe.  Kane and Mankind, I want you in the ring during tonight's Raw for an anal intrusion match. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, whatever Vince says goes.  It just seems that way, doesn't it?  Like, no wrestler goes, uh, what, are you out of your mind?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  No.  A file cabinet over the head match.  Like, oh, okay, we can do that, Vince.  Yeah, we'll try that out.  No problem.  Speaking of wrestling, Raw is War is coming to the Meadowlands Monday.  Is that true, Anthony?  That's what I hear.  Mm-hmm.  And we've heard from a bunch of the faithful listeners.  They're going. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  One guy says he's got, like, front row seats, and he's going to bring a big, huge Opie and  Anthony sign.  That's cool.  We'll be looking for that.  But I'm suggesting, boys, this is off the map.  I hope the promotions department could come up with a prize.  But I'm thinking that maybe we could have a little Opie and Anthony little, you know,  contest here.  Mm-hmm.  The best Opie and Anthony sign we see on Raw is War this coming Monday from the Meadowlands.  Because we watch it.  We watch every Monday. 
[00:51:00]  So we'll sit there and pick out an Opie and Anthony sign.  The best sign we see.  We'll give them a prize.  We'll give you a really good prize.  Maybe, like, a huge Opie and Anthony prize package.  We'll throw in a bunch of stuff for you.  I like that idea.  And what you do is, you know, you show your sign on TV.  And then you come in the next day with the sign.  And we'll prove it was you.  And then we'll, you know.  I like that.  Give you something.  We could try it.  Yeah.  Give it a whirl.  Give it a whirl if you're going to Raw is War at the Meadowlands Monday.  All right?  All right. 
[00:51:30]  So that's tomorrow, Vince McMahon.  And then Friday.  Forget about it.  Friday sounds like it's gearing up to be a pretty cool show.  Wow.  Who's bringing the keg is all I have to say.  Because we got our pal Stephen Lynch coming in Friday.  Yeah.  He's promoting his gig at Caroline's.  He's playing Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at Caroline's.  Mm-hmm.  Ticket's going fast.  He's great live.  Oh, yeah.  He's coming in Friday.  And he's going to play a couple songs that he's never played on our show.  Cool.  A couple that we saw when we were at Caroline's last time that I couldn't breathe. 
[00:52:00]  I was laughing so hard.  Yeah.  So he's coming in.  And then I believe there's a bunch of girls coming in to challenge Tara as the hottest girl to ever, you know, take her clothes off on the Opie and Anthony show.  Phew.  Which means we need a website by Friday.  Well, actually, I'm working on that as we speak.  What I'm doing is I have some leads already on websites that we're going to get.  But just in case, I am putting the pictures up on PornCity.net's site. 
[00:52:30]  We just have to go right to the bottom of the barrel, don't we?  Are you really putting them over there?  I am putting them on PornCity.net.  This is the only place that will accept our pictures.  We got kicked off six servers.  Six servers with cute names, you know?  Yeah.  Like WebJump.  Yeah.  Sounds fun.  Yeah.  Come on, jump into the web over here.  And then they saw and went, ah, get that out of here.  So now we're at PornCity.net. 
[00:53:00]  I will put the links up.  Okay.  As soon as I get the pics on.  So the pictures may be up again?  Yeah, they should be up tonight.  Tonight.  Okay.  Yeah, I'll put them there.  And then when we get a permanent server, when we hash this all out, it'll be taken care of.  But for now, I'll see how this works.  Honestly, we've got to.  If we get kicked off by PornCity.net, I'm cashing it in.  I think that's our goal.  Let's try to get kicked off PornCity.  What do you have to.  I've seen some of these pictures.  Believe me.  That's not face cream.  It's not Vaseline intensive care. 
[00:53:30]  Believe me.  All right.  Okay.  We've got a couple of heavy hitters coming to the table to give us some web space.  So we're trying to work that out.  Yeah.  A nice fast server where you don't have to wait like 10 minutes for the pictures to download.  And it's going to be cool, hopefully.  Right.  But that's what we've got going on Friday.  We've got Stephen Lynch playing the songs and a bunch of girls trying to take Tara's crown.  Yeah.  What we're going to do is, how many girls are showing Friday, Rick?  We've got four.  Four?  Four.  We're up to four.  Four girls.  So I think what we need to do is we'll get the four girls in here naked. 
[00:54:00]  Okay?  Yeah.  And then we'll have the listeners decide which one of the four will take on Tara officially.  Okay.  And then, of course, we get to bring Tara in again to, you know, get a whole bunch of new  shots done because she's working out and her hair is getting longer and stuff.  Yeah.  You know.  Ooh.  So we'll figure all that out.  Yeah.  She's a dirty girl.  Yeah.  All right.  You want to do some phone roulette here, Anthony?  A little phonage.  They seem to be ringing, huh?  All right. 
[00:54:30]  Well, not that one, though.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello.  Hi.  What's up, buddy?  You're on the air, sir.  All right.  I started listening to your show yesterday.  You guys are hilarious.  Oh, my God.  Yesterday?  That is like a shank going into my spleen.  Right here.  When we hear that you just started listening yesterday.  Because we've been here for nine months.  Nine months.  I've been living in Vermont.  I just came back home to Jersey.  All right.  All right.  All right.  So I haven't had N.E.W.  But I started laughing when you guys just played Heart. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Because the first concert I ever went to when I was in my seventh grade was a Heart concert.  My cousin took me.  He's this guy that's like stuck.  He's still stuck in the 80s.  Because his favorite bands are like Great White and Whitesnake.  Yeah.  Yep. </pre>
