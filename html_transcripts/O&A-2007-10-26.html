<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from Boston began with a mocking discussion of a Boston Globe article that ridiculed a competing radio show, "The Hillman and his Mantown radio show," for its reliance on local knowledge. Opie and Anthony contrasted this with their own career progression from a smaller Worcester station to their current, more successful Boston station, BCN, showcasing their own brand of humor.  They then transitioned to discussing the previous night's Red Sox game, their upcoming Halloween party (highlighting a past disastrous party with Flavor Flav, his entourage, and Chuck D), and their critiques of musical performances at the World Series, particularly James Taylor's National Anthem rendition and their contrasting opinions on Bob Dylan and Tom Petty.  A listener contest offering $1,000 to the tenth caller to identify a specific sound cue was also announced.

A substantial portion of the show centered around brainstorming a new segment, "Fart Trivia," a contest where contestants would fart to "buzz in" and answer trivia questions.  The hosts engaged in extensive, often crude, discussion about the rules, potential difficulties, and necessary dietary preparation for contestants, interspersed with numerous caller interactions covering various topics, including the Red Sox, the planned "Fart Trivia," their past experiences, and other unrelated subjects.  The segment included much offensive language and humor.

The show then shifted to a detailed account of the preparation and aftermath of E-Rock's and "Master Poe's" (an XM security guard) appearance on Channel 11's "Dance Friday" segment.  The hosts described their coaching of the dance routine to Paula Abdul's "Straight Up," with Jill (a news reporter) providing choreography. This segment featured calls from Jen, a self-described "contest whore," and Nick from Michigan, who won $1,000.  The hosts also extensively riffed on a Channel 11 news reporter referred to as "Smug Guy," and created a new segment called "Fart Friday." The post-Dance Friday discussion focused on the performance, particularly Poe's and E-Rock's awkward dancing and Poe's attempt to flirt with Jill.  Master Poe promoted a body rock seminar he was holding. A YouTube video titled "Retards Dancing on Opie and Anthony" was also mentioned.

Further discussion included a debate on the Red Sox playoff series format (2-3-2 vs. 2-2-1-1-1),  a humorous analysis of a supposedly poorly performed Carl Lewis rendition of the National Anthem, and a call from Charlie who gave his opinion on the baseball playoff format.  A caller, Tom, described respiratory issues exacerbated by rainy days, leading to humorous banter.  Another caller, Brian, shared his success in quitting smoking after hearing Tom's calls.  A news story about racially charged junk mail was also discussed.  Audio segments, including a "Japanese fart party" and "The Ass Whisperer," were played, and the hosts provided their Dish Network-sponsored football picks. The show also covered difficulties securing tickets for their Halloween party, touching on contest rules and payola concerns, along with past show segments featuring Star Wars costumed guests, and a new book about the oil trading industry.  The segment was permeated with off-color humor and banter.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a discussion about Dubai, covering its extravagant hotels, shopping malls, and Westernized atmosphere.  Callers contributed anecdotes about Dubai's multicultural nature and rapid construction, including a caller whose girlfriend had a bad experience during a trip to Dubai. This segment featured Ben Mezrich, author of "Bringing Down the House," who discussed his books, including "Ugly Americans" (detailing a New Jersey native's exploits in Japan's sex industry and finance), and his new book "Rigged." He recounted experiences interviewing Yakuza members and described Japanese sex clubs. Mezrich further discussed his expertise in casino gambling, card counting techniques, personal gambling experiences, casino security measures, and various casino schemes, including counterfeit coins and roulette manipulation. The "innkeepers rule" and the use of Facebook databases to identify cheaters were also covered.

The final segment revisited casino gambling, with Mezrich detailing cheating methods (card counting, roulette distraction, and Keno prediction) and casino countermeasures, including offering comps to bad counters or banning high-rollers.  He shared anecdotes about casino efforts to retain high-roller gamblers and his own gambling experiences.  The segment concluded with a "Line of the Day" featuring offensive humor, a mention of sending Anthony to a casino on a private jet, and an absurd song about flatulence.  The broadcast ended with a recap of their planned road trip and a mention of E-Rock's upcoming local television dance show appearance, which was briefly interrupted by a technical issue, followed by a segment of listener-submitted angry messages for the “FU Line”.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel...  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  If you want to put it, feel free.  I've done it before.  I'll let you go from to my and that's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio B-Rock in the bathroom.  They are sick. 
[00:01:00]  Can you pop this there?  I want to see something squirt out.  Aim it over there.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Broadcasting live from Boston. 
[00:01:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Ooh.  Good morning.  Here we are live at the BCN studios in Boston.  Big win for the Red Sox last night.  Go Sox, go.  See, that's all you have to do.  Yeah.  And you can save on travel expenses.  Now we're, yeah, local.  Yeah.  I guess the Boston Globe has a little story about our competition. 
[00:02:00]  If you could call it that.  Yeah, please.  The Hillman and his Mantown radio show.  Mantown.  And in the article, it's like, you know, it's very important to be local.  That's the edge I got over Opie and Anthony and everybody else.  That I'm a local guy.  Translation.  You're stuck in Worcester.  You always wanted more for yourself. 
[00:02:30]  And it never happened.  And he's been stuck there for years.  What I bring to the table is my local knowledge of the area.  A lot of food.  And this gives me an advantage over everybody else that I'm competing against.  Does it?  Or did you really, really want to move on from that asshole?  It's just been there.  You're the last guy left.  Why don't they talk about how you're the last guy left?  Because no one wanted you. 
[00:03:00]  Just sit there.  In Worcester.  He talks like a man.  Moving from sports to politics to guy talk.  Let's talk sports and then politics and then some man talk.  Shut up.  You don't have much of an advantage, by the way.  Shut up, stupid.  If the advantage was talking locally and you were doing that, you should be killing in the ratings. 
[00:03:30]  And you're not.  What happened?  Too inside for everybody, probably.  Yeah.  Probably.  A little bit.  Just one of our morning shows that we compete against had a little article in the paper today.  The constant battles.  And it kind of made me laugh really, really hard.  Because we just know the true story.  He's stuck there.  No one wanted him.  Because if you're in radio, you're always trying to move up. 
[00:04:00]  You're always trying to move up to a bigger station.  Of course.  Like, no offense to the...  Well, no.  A lot of offense, actually.  AF is a crappy station.  We worked there.  We had fun there.  You know, we'll never deny that.  Well, we always had our sights on bigger and better things.  Yeah, that was a stepping stone.  Right.  And bigger and better things just in the Boston area is to work for BCN.  Yeah.  You know, the top dog in town.  The big rock station in the middle of the city. 
[00:04:30]  The big kahuna.  Even when we were at AF, which is a station all the way out there in Worcester, we were calling BCN trying to get a job.  Remember?  Live on our show.  Yeah.  Because we even knew.  I forgot about that.  We did try to get a job.  We even knew.  We're like, you know what?  This is fun and all.  But let's be honest.  You know, you need to get to BCN.  So we used to call the program director live on our show.  Our PD, our program director at the time, would lose his freaking mind. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, he wasn't happy at all.  What are you guys doing?  He would run in and I'm like, ah, we're just pranking them.  But the reality was we weren't.  We were begging for a job as we were doing an afternoon drive show for the competition.  We were only joking.  Not really, though.  Not really.  You know?  But I love some of these local morning shows.  They act like, no, this is the place I want to be, man.  Hey, this is the place to be.  It's just not true.  Isn't this great?  It's not true.  Radio guys, as soon as they get a gig, they're already looking to see where I could go next. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Where can I go next that's a little bigger and a little cooler?  But you have to act like you don't want to do that.  Like, you know what?  I'm happy to be here.  This is exactly the level I kind of wanted to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Iraq, Google our names there because we're mentioning the article.  And I just want to read another line that made me laugh.  Google.  You sure he's Googling for that information and not for missile launches into Israel?  What?  What?  What's that about?  Yeah, it's hysterical.  Jesus. 
[00:06:00]  Apparently some enemies of Israel, Palestinians and whatnot, using Google Earth to look at the places they want to shoot missiles at.  And it's just the information that's available now on the Internet is amazing.  And it can be used like that where you just look and go, okay, yeah, that building, let's try to take that one out.  And then you shoot missiles at it.  It's amazing. 
[00:06:30]  Google.  It's amazing.  It's either for pornography or to kill other people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the future.  Anyway, let me just read this.  So even even in every man can become an institution.  Greg, stop right there, Iraq, or I'm coming over there and slapping you.  Oh, boy.  No, don't mark up his face.  Hit him in the body.  Pay attention.  Hit him.  He's got to dance.  He's one line away from losing me here. 
[00:07:00]  Just stop right there.  Oh, here it is.  The Edge, says Hill, is the local knowledge that allows him to second-guess the Red Sox World Series lineup.  That's the Edge you got on Austin and everybody else?  Is that it?  You can second-guess the Red Sox World Series lineup?  Is that it? 
[00:07:30]  I want to do Jim Norton's new impression.  Can you read that line?  Who are the impression?  Or you just jump in when you feel fit.  The Edge, says Hill, is the local knowledge that allows him to second-guess the Red Sox World Series lineup.  Well, he also raises a point, which I think is kind of cool, that I think being from the market makes a huge difference, says Hill.  You're not acting like you know how to pronounce it.  Oh, this guy's heinous. 
[00:08:00]  Jimmy, wake up.  Read a little more of the article, please.  Well, no, he was very interesting.  He's like, the fact that we do a talk show insulates us from that somewhat Sid Hill, Ron Valerian, to Greg's...  I want to apologize to everybody listening to us in Boston that we can't second-guess the Red Sox World Series lineup. 
[00:08:30]  I'm sorry.  Don't second-guess it.  I guess you're going to have to tune in the Hill man and his man show to get that knowledge and that info.  We certainly...  What?  David Ortiz, what are they thinking?  Get Jim Rice in there!  Where's Freddie Lynn?  You're second-guessing.  I don't need Curt Schilling.  How about oil can Boyd?  Oil can.  Oil can.  He could take his clothes off and run out in the field.  Lunatic.  What about Charles Stewart? 
[00:09:00]  I want him playing center field.  Charles Stewart?  He doesn't know anything about baseball.  He knows how to make up a fine lie, though.  He was terrific.  Well, and then you can talk about Tim Wakefield, how he was left off the...  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.  Was he really off the roster?  Yeah.  Unless they put him back on.  He said he's got a little injury, but I think it's that silly pitch.  He's got an injury from throwing the ball 20 miles an hour.  Yeah.  Maybe it's because you shouldn't dig your knuckles into a ball and throw it at men with bats. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  And expect him to not hit it out of the park.  Yeah.  His muscles have to hold back so much that they're...  I guess he's pulling muscles.  Yeah.  From holding it back.  From holding it back.  It wants to throw a 95 mile an hour fastball.  Yeah.  Well, his arm's probably embarrassed.  He's got to hang out with these real pitchers and Schilling.  Second guess.  And his arm is just kind of going, no, no, no, no, faster.  We can't talk about this.  We're not there. 
[00:10:00]  I would love to answer the phones, but I can't today.  Oh, it was that mouse maybe?  This is odd because I can't get my PalTalk camera to work either.  Erox is working just fine.  And we all know how important PalTalk is.  Mine doesn't work.  Very important.  Well, we get people in here.  200.  It's nice to have the camera view so they can see.  All right.  Well, we're not in Boston, of course.  But, you know, that's how easy it is to just make it sound like you're local. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  That's what we're going to do for now on.  Like Monday, we're going to be broadcasting live from Buffalo.  Yes.  That's what we do.  Eh, why not?  Monday, we'll be in Buffalo.  And then while we're up there, we'll head over to Syracuse.  We'll broadcast live from Syracuse on Tuesday.  Yep.  And we'll keep moving east.  We'll broadcast from Providence on Wednesday.  Maybe we'll shoot up to Maine and look at some moosin' on Thursday morning.  And then Friday, we'll shoot past New York and we'll broadcast live from... 
[00:11:00]  Well, we can't broadcast live from Washington because that would be silly.  Yes.  Because we're not on live in Washington.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon to Cleveland.  Washington and Cleveland.  Oh, wait.  We have to hit Cleveland somehow.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll have to readjust our live.  In the afternoon.  But the Opie and Anthony show hitting the road and we'll be broadcasting live from Buffalo  on Monday, Cleveland on Tuesday.  We'll do that.  Yeah.  Then we'll shoot back up towards Syracuse, Providence, Maine, and then what?  Back to New York?  I don't know.  I have to look at all the pins in my map and then pull them out angrily and suffocate on 
[00:11:30]  my big head.  But we are heading to Boston after today's show for the big Halloween party tonight.  Yeah.  Looking forward to that.  BCN Halloween party.  BCN's big creepy night Halloween party.  Big creepy night.  Ooh.  That means it's a year ago that Flavor Flav pretty much hijacked our Halloween show.  Wow.  It's a year already?  Wow.  Wow.  Still have nightmares about it, though. 
[00:12:00]  Well, that's the reason why we're not doing a Halloween party this year.  To wake up in cold sweats.  Yeah.  We're still getting over what happened last year.  Flavor Flav.  Someone got the bright idea that we should have Flavor Flav.  He was really hot last year this time.  And he had a CD drop.  Remember?  Yo.  Remember that CD that no one heard from?  What?  Did he?  And it was told to us he was going to just come out on stage and say hi to our audience,  which was extremely white.  Yeah.  But we're like, what the hell? 
[00:12:30]  I think there was a lot of white people watching Flavor of Love.  So I'm like, yeah, this sounds kind of cool.  And then he proceeded to hijack the stage for close to an hour.  Brought out his posse.  He brought out his entire family.  He brought out, yeah.  Some thugs.  Some.  A couple of thugs.  Roland had a good thug story from then.  He bumped into somebody and was trying to tell him something, trying to get somebody out of an area. 
[00:13:00]  And this big guy just goes, I wouldn't do that.  And then kind of bumped into Roland.  Yeah.  And Roland just felt this huge gun underneath the guy's jacket.  Really?  Yeah.  So he was like, okay.  Yeah.  It was a really good Halloween party until we announced Flavor Flav.  And then, honestly, he destroyed it.  And we don't even know what that party was about anymore.  And it was going pretty well up to that point. 
[00:13:30]  It was Flavor Flav's coming out party.  Yeah.  He really thought that this was his CD release party.  In front of an extremely white audience.  Why would...  Someone should have informed him.  He really believed, though.  It was the O&A Halloween party.  And it turned into just a rap album release party.  Thank God there was no shootings.  Well, Chuck D showed up from Public Enemy.  We were on stage together for the first time in five years.  Yeah.  Hot 97 and all those other stations wanted him and couldn't get him.  Yeah.  Because we had him. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, we had him.  Believe me.  This didn't work out for anyone.  Yeah.  This wasn't Flav's vision of an album drop.  No.  A bunch of white guys with mullets and, like, mega death t-shirts.  But that was the observation of the day.  I don't think Flavor Flav had any clue that that wasn't his CD release party.  Yeah.  But his posse, his family, and everyone he brought out on the stage was like, oh, my God.  This isn't for him.  He told us all this was his big party for his CD.  This is not why these people are here. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Going to be dropping boy here at the Hard Rock.  Really?  Yeah.  Can we possibly...  Who are these people?  Can we maybe get some of these pictures up on onaradio.com later today?  He had to introduce all of his kids and wives and the uncles and, oh, on and on.  The introduction of the kids alone took 20 minutes.  Yeah.  That's a Flavor Flav has a lot of kids joke.  Of course it does.  And his album was not that... 
[00:15:00]  Like, we heard some of the...  He did, like, one of the songs, and it was terrible.  It was terrible.  You know, old school guys have a little trouble.  He was never great, though.  No, he was like the comedy relief.  Yeah, he was the hype man.  Yeah.  So, yeah, we'll put some of those pictures up because we're going down memory lane with  that one today, that's for sure.  Big win for the Sox.  Curt Schilling did great last night.  That's all most people need to know.  They don't need info about, you know, second-guessing a lineup for a game. 
[00:15:30]  You leave that to the...  Stats?  You leave that crap to the sports talk stations.  Yeah.  We don't compete with sports talk stations on that level.  The people that really want to hear that crap will go to a sports station.  That's what it comes down to.  You just want the facts.  So you can go to work and rattle off stats to people that don't care.  Right, right.  So you listen to the sports station, get into work, and go, well, let me tell you about  this.  Yeah.  But chilling looked great.  Sox beat the Rockies, of course. 
[00:16:00]  You know that by now.  Two to one.  The game, you know, it lasted until about two in the morning.  That's good.  That's always good for viewership.  I don't even know why we're acknowledging Boston.  It's too early for them.  They're not up yet.  Game's over, and then they got to do some partying, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, please.  They're not up for another hour or two.  But, of course, the Sox lead the series two to zip.  They're not sleeping.  They're just passed out.  And Than brought something to the show today, and I actually saw this myself, and I couldn't 
[00:16:30]  believe it, Than.  So very good.  James Taylor singing the National Anthem at the World Series.  Ooh.  Did you hear this?  No.  You weren't up for the start of the game?  No.  James Taylor had a horrendous, horrendous version of the National Anthem.  Really?  Yeah, listen to this.  Or part of it.  Boston's own, James Taylor.  Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proud we've re-held at the twilight's 
[00:17:00]  last gleaming, whose broad stripes and bright stars.  You've certainly got to go low at the beginning of that song, because it cranks up at the end.  He's a great performer and all that.  I would never deny that.  But it's the World Series, and you get this easy listening version of the National Anthem. 
[00:17:30]  He's doing it easy.  That's absolutely what you're going to get out of him.  Half of Fenway is completely plastered.  They need some energy to get this thing going.  I don't even blame him.  I blame whoever booked him for that, because he's just doing what he does.  That's pretty much it.  He does have a good voice.  I don't even like him.  I think his songs are awful.  I know he's a good singer.  You think James Taylor's songs are awful?  I know.  Except for Fire and Rain.  I want to like him.  I want to like him. 
[00:18:00]  But like, you got a friend.  What's wrong with that?  You don't like to hear you got a friend, Jimmy?  No.  I don't know why I don't like him.  When you're down in trouble and you need a helping hand.  And then I don't know the rest.  They all call Carly Simon and her stupid performance Fear, his dumb ex-wife.  Giant steam shovel jaw.  Let's go to Glenn in Boston. 
[00:18:30]  Glenn, what's up?  You got a friend.  Yeah, her name ain't Susanna, though, is it?  See that?  You connect the songs.  Wink, wink.  Glenn?  Gentlemen?  Yeah.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Hey, guys.  So I say, oh, thanks a lot for saying Go Sox Go.  And I'm up.  I'm up every morning before you boys get up.  I got 2 o'clock every morning.  It was great.  I'm very proud of you.  That's very cool.  All I did was hit rewind.  Rewind for 15 minutes, and then that's it.  I saw the end of the game. 
[00:19:00]  It was great.  Yeah, that's the smart way to do it.  You know, because you could sleep in.  I mean, you don't have to, like, stay up all night.  You're not going to get the news who won the game.  Right.  Get up.  First thing you do is you hit your TV.  You do a little DVR action, and there you go.  Yeah.  That's it.  And you're well-rested for the day.  Huh?  Can I make a request?  Sure.  Can you hit that ring, ring, ring, banana phone?  Oh, why?  Why do you want that today?  Why?  It's been stuck in my head for years.  Yeah, we do like that one. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, that'll get it out to hear it again.  Just recharge that battery.  Well, we could do that for them.  All right.  Go, Sox, go.  I know the sports curse is going to be over.  Finally.  Finally.  Maybe your Mets will win next year.  Well, honestly, I mean, who wouldn't want to see the Mets and the Red Sox in the World  Series?  That would be huge for everybody involved.  We would have a lot of fun with that.  And, you know, us down here in New York and you guys up there in Boston, we could have  a lot of fun with that one.  You know that.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:20:00]  That's why we don't hide and try to make believe that we like the teams in the cities  we broadcast from, for the most part.  Yeah.  I mean, we'll fake it every once in a while.  We'll BS.  But even in our heyday up there at, you know, working in radio in Boston, we made it perfectly  clear, you know, what teams we're into.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right, Glenn.  Thank you.  Go Sox, go.  Thank you, guys.  Goodbye.  All right.  I know they're going for the local angle and all that, but why not? 
[00:20:30]  Like, get Steven Tyler.  Yeah.  Like, get him to rev up the crowd at Fenway. 
[00:21:00]  I don't know.  I mean, because this is right before the first pitch.  You really need something a little more energetic.  Yeah.  And I love James Taylor.  Well, I little known fact, I actually sat in the second row for a James Taylor concert  back in the day and had a really, really good time.  Gay.  Gordon in Boston, what's up?  Absolutely nothing, guys.  What's up with you?  And yes, go Sox, go.  Go Sox, go. 
[00:21:30]  The sports curse will finally be over.  Oh, boy.  Two games to go.  Thank you, sir.  But there are some people in Boston actually awake.  Yeah, but not many, though.  We usually get more calls on this.  It's the ones that are still awake from last night, though.  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  Well, I had to work last night, so yeah, I'm still awake.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Have a good day, boys.  Yeah.  Bye-bye.  Oh, it just goes on and on.  Huh? 
[00:22:00]  It just goes on and on, huh?  Let's see if...  That our flag was still there.  Oh.  E-Rock, because we're talking about this stuff, you want to hear bad.  He has Bob Dylan singing Take Me Out to the Ballgame.  Have you heard this?  Oh.  This is amazing.  Take me out to the ballgame.  Take me out with the crowd.  Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks.  I don't care if I never get back.  Let me root, root, root for the home team. 
[00:22:30]  If they don't win, it's a shame.  For it's one, two, three strikes.  You're out at the old ballgame.  All he has to do is blow his nose, and he would just be amazing to listen to.  What is he?  Why is he singing a cappella?  Yeah.  Why did he do that?  Why did he do that?  Why did somebody say we can download that?  Could you just sing it real quick?  We could play it at ballparks all over.  The kids. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, right.  Forgot.  Let's start right now.  Play ball.  All right, the great James Taylor.  And now we get ready for the first inning. 
[00:23:30]  We'll be back.  He obviously has a great voice and all, but I guess you had to be watching last night because  it's like people are losing their minds.  It's going through the World Series and they bring him out and you can just see like the  energy just going.  Why didn't they just bring out Jay Giles?  With his wig?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  We went to see the Stones press conference that day.  Jay Giles was there.  Yeah.  And he has a black thing on his head.  Yes, he certainly does. 
[00:24:00]  What is that?  What is that?  It's not hair.  Look, I'm convinced that I saw Jay Giles.  This is way inside.  Someone made me paranoid yesterday saying we're talking to inside at times.  When we went out to LA to broadcast live and we were on the same plane as Jay Giles.  Yeah.  What's his real name there?  I just call him Jay Giles.  What the hell's his name?  I don't know.  Jay?  What is that?  Jay Giles.  Peter Wolf.  Mr. Giles.  Peter Wolf.  Yes, Peter Wolf.  And we pretty much sat next to Peter Wolf and we were like exchanging pleasantries all 
[00:24:30]  the way out to LA talking.  Mangy Wolf.  And he was actually showing us that he was working on his latest project on a laptop,  which was kind of, now everyone does that, but this was like 10, 12 years ago.  He's like, wow, he's on a plane with a computer.  Because we're like, what are you doing?  He's like, oh, I'm kind of working on my latest CD.  I'm like, what?  What?  As you fly?  That's kind of weird.  But now it's commonplace, right?  So we talked to him enough where we knew each other.  And then we're getting our bags at LAX and we're all waiting for our bags. 
[00:25:00]  So he knew who we were.  We knew who he was.  And it happened that he was staying in the same hotel as us on Sunset Strip.  Yep.  And I went out for coffee one morning.  And all of a sudden this man, this bald man, turns the corner and I go, holy crap, I think  that's Peter Wolf without his wig.  And he looked at me in a panic like, oh my God, I didn't think anyone would see me this  early in the morning. 
[00:25:30]  He looked me in the eyes, made believe he didn't know me and kept walking.  To this day, I'm convinced I saw Peter Wolf without his wig and it creeped me out.  I'm sure you did.  What did it look like?  Was it horseshoe?  Was it completely?  Low horseshoe.  Low horseshoe.  Low horseshoe.  Wow.  Low horseshoe.  So.  Well, the wig is so believable though.  I mean, you wouldn't notice it if it was dark and you had been blinded and you were across  the street facing the other way. 
[00:26:00]  Good God.  Sir, there's a jet black thing on your head.  I don't know what that is.  Jet black.  You have night on your head.  In the afternoon, you're carrying night around on your head.  I think you have a piece of Star Trek memorabilia on your head.  Let's go to Lead Belly.  Lead Belly.  Morning, boys.  One of the faithful.  What's up, Lead Belly?  How's it going, guys?  Hey, good.  Okay, I got a quick question about your sports curve.  Yeah.  When the Patriots won the Super Bowl for those three out of the four years, did you not pick 
[00:26:30]  them at all?  That's a really good question.  I don't think so.  I don't really think I did.  Like, those were kind of given wins.  I mean, that should have ended the sports curve like five years ago.  I know.  I know.  That would have been an easy one.  But at the time, you didn't know how easy it was going to be.  Yeah, I really don't think I did because, I mean, to the best of our knowledge, I haven't  picked a winner in a really, really long time.  But this time, I got them. 
[00:27:00]  Go, Sox, go.  Go, Sox, go.  All right, Lead Belly.  Thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Everyone's requesting boys to men doing the seventh inning stretch.  If you can find that, that would be great.  It's coming in on the phones, on instant feedback, a little ongoing theme.  And also, we got to get the slow kids singing and then the crowd freaking helping them out.  That's one of my favorite clips.  Actually, it brings a tear to my eye.  A tear to your eye.  We'll have to replay that today.  And what's today's sound that people need to listen for? 
[00:27:30]  Oh, yes.  Here it is.  This, of course, between 7 and 7.30 this morning.  If you hear this sound, call in if you're the, what caller, 10?  Yeah.  Tenth caller.  You'll win $1,000.  Here is the sound.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  Okay.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  And no calling until you hear, if you call during a ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, we're going to hang up on you. 
[00:28:00]  You need to go, all right.  And also, we got to take a break, but we're all very excited because it's Dance Friday.  Oh.  And our own E-Rock and Master Poll will be on live TV.  We'll be simulcasting it.  We'll get the video up on onaradio.com later today.  We'll talk more about it after the break because we're really looking.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:28:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  So we were just in the ONA lab.  We're working on some new bits for the show.  The lab down at the Institute.  We should bring some of these ideas to the people.  Because some of them never see the light of day.  Yeah, unfortunately.  But I do have an idea.  And I don't know how it's going to work yet.  But I think we can pull it off.  Yeah, that sounds totally doable. 
[00:29:00]  We want to get a really good prize.  And don't worry, Tracy.  It'll be part of Pinpoint listening.  Pinpoint listening.  ONA fart trivia.  Now, how exactly does this work?  I was in the ONA lab and just kind of formulating this, trying to figure it out.  And I need a little help.  But I'm thinking you get a studio filled with people. 
[00:29:30]  Because you're going to need a lot of people, obviously.  Yeah.  Let's say 10 to 12 hardcore listeners.  Okay.  And then we do a trivia contest.  The questions are so easy.  Like, how many states in the United States of America?  48.  Oh, my God.  Of course.  Yeah.  Everyone knows the answer.  But here's the problem.  You can't answer until you fart.  Oh, so that's like you're qualified.  That's like the buzzer on Jeopardy. 
[00:30:00]  That's the buzzer, right.  You got it.  Now, it could be a really boring show if you've got a studio filled with people and they can't  fart to answer these simple questions.  That'd be sad.  But that could be kind of funny.  But then I'm thinking, leave it to the listeners.  They'll figure out, you know, what they need to do personally to make sure they're farting  a lot.  Yeah.  Because they could maybe do something a few days in advance to make sure that they have  a build up.  It would be really funny to watch a couple of people really trying to hit that buzzer. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  First.  But the prize has to be really good.  And the questions have to be so easy that people are like, oh, my God, all I have to  do is fart and I'll get a point here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No thinking in this game.  No.  None.  Well, maybe a little.  Maybe a little bit.  That's like Joker's wild questions.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Those are always simple.  No kidding.  I think this could work.  Because I know personally, like if I eat a lot of beans, it's going to be a nightmare 
[00:31:00]  the next day.  And I'm thinking our listeners are smart enough where they can figure out their formula the  night before or the day before and they could kind of plan it out perfectly.  Yeah.  So, you know, there's a lot of farting going on when the contest hits.  What do you think?  What do you think?  I like it.  Should we bring this one to the people or what?  I like it.  Does it need to be honed a little bit more in the O&A labs?  Uh, no.  I think the basic framework is there.  Yeah.  I think the contestants are going to have to do a little work beforehand. 
[00:31:30]  A little work on their diet when they come in.  But that's the beauty of the thing, too.  Of course, yeah.  You know, the listener that knows how to figure out all that.  Got the answer.  But what about a silent but deadly?  Is that where we use maybe the interns?  No.  Where a guy...  It has to make a noise?  The Joker's Wild.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Those questions.  If you watched Jeopardy!  And then you watched The Joker's Wild, you'd be like...  They would ask you some kind of tough question.  You'd think it was a tough question.  It's like, this president crossed the Potomac River.  And then you're like, okay.  His name was George Washington.  Yes!  Ton, George Washington.  For a point.  Like, they'd give you sometimes a question where you're like, 
[00:32:30]  I might know that one.  But then they'd fill in the blanks completely.  It was Jeopardy! for the Mongoloids.  Oh, whammies.  Oh, I landed on a whammy.  And then the stupid animation comes out.  Yeah.  That was retarded, too.  Never liked that show.  When they'd have to sit and look down like the whammies,  the dancing whammy things were really in front of them.  And go like, uh-huh. 
[00:33:00]  And dance along with them as they just lost money.  Yeah.  I'd be like cursing.  Would they dance with the whammy?  Oh, they would dance with the whammy.  Speaking of dancing, I just cannot wait.  Yeah, we're a little distracted today because our own E-Rock is going to be on Jill TV for Dance Friday.  Is Master Poe going, too?  Master Poe is going, too.  Now, I think back to days like the last episode of MASH.  Yeah.  When you gathered around the TV to see something that was going to make history. 
[00:33:30]  This is how I feel today.  I hope they both wind up like certain soldiers in the last episode of MASH.  This is going to be so horrific.  Yeah.  Our own E-Rock, we saw how he was trying to dance.  We gave him dance lessons yesterday.  It was a little shakedown dance between him and Master Poe.  Master Poe was teaching him some moves.  And E-Rock, he has no sense of rhythm whatsoever. 
[00:34:00]  And he's already uncomfortable in his own skin.  So it's going to make for a great, great view today.  Horrid.  Yeah.  Can we get back to the fart trivia?  Oh.  I'm obsessed with it.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  He writes, Opie, I'd like to buy a bowel.  Ah, well, of course, Steve.  Let's go to Russ in Connecticut.  Russ.  Hey, what happens if somebody craps themselves?  Are they disqualified from fart trivia?  You know what?  I say no.  I say yes. 
[00:34:30]  Wow.  I say yes because I know our listeners.  They don't give a crap.  I think they should have to stand there and can finish the game if they can.  Like I said, I know our listeners.  And they would go, and now what?  Now what you want?  But just think of what the following ones would sound like if he tries to answer more questions.  It could be a true disaster.  Sneezing into a beard.  I don't even know what that means.  It's disgusting.  Can we get this done by maybe, I don't know, like next Friday? 
[00:35:00]  We'll have a fun Friday show.  We obviously have to pre-qualify people because they're going to have to work and train a little bit with their diet.  I suggest a lot of broccoli.  Yeah.  And maybe some spinach.  White Castle.  Broccoli Rob.  A bit of White Castle.  Yeah.  White Castle.  Oh.  Some beer.  Some cheap beer.  Whole milk gets me going.  Whole milk.  If you're lactose intolerant. 
[00:35:30]  I think I got a little lactose thing happening.  Then we're talking.  You know, then we'll get some people in here that are probably going to be true champions.  A couple of McDonald's.  White Castle is wonderful stuff.  You give me a few of them.  Any person, really.  You know what sucks about this show?  We try to go highbrow and give you the news and give our take on like the wildfires and this and that.  And the phones, it's like crickets.  You talk about far trivia.  Look at this.  Oh, they just love the idea.  This is what the people want.  They love the idea. 
[00:36:00]  This is what they want.  Who wouldn't?  Frosty, Wisconsin.  What's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Frosty.  I'm just wondering how Iraq's going to be away dancing with Master Poe.  Well, who's going to fill in for him?  His fill in is a mannequin.  So we're all set.  We're covered here.  We're good.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  We got a mannequin with the E-Rock hat on it.  And he's actually doing more in the minutes he's been sitting there.  Yeah, just sitting there cold-faced. 
[00:36:30]  Stone-faced, I should have said.  Thank you, Frosty.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  Hellman's jar in a wig is sitting there.  That's Steve.  That's what we should have done.  Put that on Pal Talk.  Pat of Boston, what's up?  Hey, morning, guys.  Good morning.  Go Sox, go, man.  You obviously caught the old seventh-inning stretch there.  Yep.  I just want to know, when did Cedric the Entertainer join Boys to Men?  You didn't like the Boys to Men? 
[00:37:00]  Well, they're certainly men now.  It's men to old men?  Yeah.  Is that what it is now?  It's men.  You know, I don't know if that's Bob Dylan or if you guys got Gribble there from King  of the Hill to sing that song.  Yeah, the Bob Dylan thing.  Someone had a great line in Instant Feedback.  He goes, well, if Bob Dylan did sneeze, Tom Petty would fall out of his nose.  Oh.  Does Tom Petty sound like him?  Oh, boy, does he, Jimmy?  All right, Pat.  Thank you.  I never liked Tom Petty either.  So take another dream. 
[00:37:30]  Wait, what's that song?  A Bob.  That was one of his newer ones.  Tom Petty was pretty big at the beginning of MTV kind of thing.  I kind of enjoyed a little Tom Petty in my youth.  What's a big song by him?  Running down a dream, Jimmy.  Running down a dream.  Refugee.  I don't know.  Me and Del were singing.  Sounds a little different when he does it, though.  Just a tad.  The trees went by, me and Del were singing, a little runaway. 
[00:38:00]  I'm going to put out an album.  Sure, is that good?  Yeah.  Where you talk, spoken word of popular songs.  And then Tom Petty came out with a brilliant song about being the last DJ.  That was a fine, fine song.  Call what?  He's pretty much talking about radio and how sad it's become.  Oh, really?  That there's no real DJs left anymore.  Did he sing Tempted by the Fruit of Another?  No, that was Squeeze.  Yeah.  So you know this one?  Losing my religion? 
[00:38:30]  Well, you can't turn him into a company man.  You can't turn him into a whore.  And the boys who stares just don't understand anymore.  Well, the top brass don't like him talking so much.  And he won't play what they say to play.  And he don't want to change what don't need to change.  A lot of people can relate to this.  And there goes the last DJ. 
[00:39:00]  He's like, good?  Who plays what he wants to play.  He's making a song that no one really can relate to.  He pretty much put out a song that radio refused to play.  Yeah.  Obviously.  And I love these guys that say, oh, F it after they have nothing else to lose.  Yeah.  Well, he should have put that song out 10 years ago.  Because that's when the whole last DJ thing was happening.  Yeah.  He didn't have the balls to do it 10 years ago. 
[00:39:30]  Now it's like, ah, I have nothing to lose.  I'll put this thing out.  I liked him in the Kevin Costner movie, The Postman.  You think that's too specific?  He was in that.  A song?  No, it's actually a really cool song.  And then like hip DJs, what they do is they put the, they kind of localize that.  They put some clips from their show proving that they're the last DJ that Tom Petty's talking about.  Oh, man.  No.  No, they're not.  Oh, yes.  Like, I'm the last rebel. 
[00:40:00]  You know who.  Oh, go ahead there.  E-Rock replacement.  You know who does that?  Uses it for almost every rejoiner.  Huh?  Brother Weez.  Oh, does he?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Sorry, Weez.  Sorry.  Well, he just likes the song.  I just made fun of my mentor.  Huh?  Maybe he just likes the song.  There you go.  All right.  Hey, here's Boyz II Men singing God Bless America at the World Series.  This is terrific.  And now to honor America.  Please welcome Grammy Award winning DECA recording artist, DECA, Boys II Men, as they 
[00:40:30]  lead us in tonight's presentation of God Bless America.  God bless America.  Man that I love.  Yuck.  Stand beside her and guide her.  They sound like the landmines from Up the Academy.  If anybody remembers that reference. 
[00:41:00]  Wow.  The Mad Magazine movie.  Up the Academy, yeah.  Up the Academy.  There's a scene at a party where they're listening to a horrible band, and this is what it sounds  like.  Really?  Yes.  Well, uh.  There were three listeners that saw that.  I don't know why anyone was ever into this crap.  This is awful.  This is awful.  I heard through the night with the lights from above.  Whoa.  Right.  To the prairie.  To the yard. 
[00:41:30]  How many syllables in prairie?  White with foe.  Like another word.  Oh, God bless America.  My home sweet home.  Oh, God bless America.  My home sweet home. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, God bless America.  Let's hear it for boys to yuck.  They were terrible.  How awful is that?  What was going on at Fenway last night, man?  James Taylor at least sounded good.  They sounded bad.  Yeah, but he was so mellow.  That's why the game was only two to one.  He put everyone to sleep before the game even began.  Hey, by the way, how are we going to know we're not going to be in break when they start 
[00:42:30]  to dance?  Oh, we'll figure it out, Jimmy.  We better not be.  Oh, boy.  Why don't we, uh, we should be in constant contact with E-Rock, and we'll, uh, we'll try  to time this out because we've got to watch him, uh, live on TV for, uh, Dance Friday.  Uh, oh, hold on a minute.  Joe in Michigan.  Joe, what's up?  Hello, Joe.  Hello.  Hey.  Good evening.  Morning, guys.  Good morning.  Hey, I just want to say, uh, I'm sorry to hear you guys aren't on in Detroit anymore.  I'm trying to hear you from Grand Rapids.  Oh, thank you, sir. 
[00:43:00]  It comes in a little bit, a little staticky, so, but, uh, I've been, I've been holding  a little something in for a couple minutes now.  I just wanted to say it from the bottom of my heart.  Okay.  Thank you.  Oof.  Ah.  Thanks, guys.  Good morning.  All right.  Good morning to you, Joe.  It's March Friday.  Ooh, Fart Friday. 
[00:43:30]  Let me write that down.  That's potential.  Fart Friday.  You never know when you're going to get that spark.  Yes.  Fart Friday.  Um, yeah, we got to do Fart Trivia, though.  We just have to do that.  Okay.  Uh, Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Mike.  Yeah, listen, I want to get to the Fart Trivia contest.  Uh, the guys at work call me a machine.  At lunchtime, I must put out 30 or 40 of them. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, some people can do this, too, just like on cue, almost.  So then I say game on.  Fart Trivia.  Yeah.  Game on.  Let's do it.  Sign me up, man.  Hey, in fact, one of the farts could be one of the sound bites for the $1,000 contest.  Um, yeah, that's not a bad idea.  You want to produce a radio show?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I mean that.  All right, Mike, hold on a line.  We're going to put you in the contest.  All right, sounds like a plan.  I think we could do this.  I think there are guys out there that just could fart on command and that could make it 
[00:44:30]  really interesting.  All right.  Very cool.  Uh, we should take a break here.  It is FU Friday.  Let's go to the FU line and see what's going on.  Oh, you want to give them the sound one more time?  Let's make it easy for everybody today.  Of course we should.  For the casual listener, we'll help you out today.  Today only.  Going to be giving away $1,000 between 7 and 7.30.  It's not 7 o'clock yet.  What you're listening for is this.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
[00:45:00]  And when you hear that, be the 10th caller, 877-212-ON-A.  All right.  And you will win the next $1,000 that we're giving away, okay?  Let's see what's going on on the FU line for this FU Friday.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  This is Michael from South Jersey.  I'd like to send a nice FU to John Cook.  And the rest of the idiot WIs for getting rid of the best radio show in this city. 
[00:45:30]  Next message.  Yeah, I want to send a big f***ing queue out to those contest pigs  who keep trying to win $1,000 a day.  Where the f*** were you fat, smelly pieces of s***  when the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest was going on?  You probably would have won that, too.  Next message.  I'd like to give an FU to Al Shopkin.  Hey, Al, f*** you, you f***.  Next message.  I f***ing hate you, you rich, white, motherf***ing, stingy son of a bitch. 
[00:46:00]  You f***ing think you can get away with anything you goddamn want to please  just because you got money.  Well, take all that green and shove it up, you f***, you piece of s***.  Next message.  Hey, this is Exterminator Rich from Philly.  I just want to send a big f*** to John Cook for kicking my boys off the airwaves.  Next message.  I would just like to say that everyone who isn't me, f*** you.  End of new messages.  Call the O.P. and Anthony FU line, 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[00:46:30]  Thank you and goodbye.  Hey, good morning, it's Opie and Anthony.  The phone's just lit.  Everybody wants to talk about the fart trivia contest we're putting together.  Can't wait to hear what the lawyers have to say about this one.  I don't know if there's any legal ramifications here.  Yeah, we'll see.  There's always something.  See what they can come up with.  Hey, I'm getting my news alert on my BlackBerry.  NASA, the shuttle. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  So freaking predictable.  After waking up to Elton John's Rocket Man,  Discovery astronauts begin their six-plus-hour spacewalk this morning.  Oh, yeah.  Waking up to Rocket Man.  I get it.  Because they're in a rock.  Of course they did.  Of course they woke up to that.  Too bad there's not a song called,  but the tile must have fallen off because it's hot in here. 
[00:47:30]  Jeez.  I think Pete Diddy could work something up in an hour.  We got E-Rock on the phone.  That's very good news.  But we're also, oh, oh, oh, it has to be brought up because it's coming in like crazy.  We missed the obvious with the Tom Petty there, Jimmy.  You're asking about Tom Petty.  The opening scene to Silence of the Lambs.  That's Tom Petty, American Girl, as she's freaking driving.  American Girl.  Right, right, right.  And that was also used in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, of course. 
[00:48:00]  What scene?  Yeah, it was used in that.  You're stumping me.  I know Jackson Brown.  She must be somebody's baby.  I remember that scene.  I forget the actual scene, but I know it was in Fast Times.  Yeah.  Was it when they were going to school for the first time and there's toilet paper and everyone?  Right?  Wow, I'm trying to remember the scene now.  This is bothering me.  I'm getting stumped a lot today.  American Girl in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Wasn't it when he was driving to school? 
[00:48:30]  Because wasn't he kind of singing along?  When Judge Reinhold was driving his car for the first time?  Yeah, when he was driving to school on the first day.  To start the whole movie, basically.  And he's looking at the chicks.  Yeah, he was drumming on the steering wheel.  Yeah, I think that was it.  All right.  But I kind of thought it was Jennifer Jason Leigh in another scene, besides the one where, you know.  Well, she gets the big, you know what, as Jackson Brown's being played.  Yeah.  That was terrific. 
[00:49:00]  Hmm.  We brought it up.  I was in a Philly hotel with my girl and Fast Times came on TV.  And, you know, there's a bit of an age difference, just a little bit.  And she's turning me on to newer things.  I'm turning her on to some of the classic comedies.  And Fast Times comes on.  I go, you ever see Fast Times?  And she said no, which blew me away.  I'm like, what?  Oh, you got to watch.  And it was the TV version.  And they took a really funny movie and destroyed it.  The TV version is embarrassing to watch. 
[00:49:30]  It sucks.  And after 20 minutes, I awkwardly went, uh, uh, well, let's, uh, let's, let's watch golf.  It just sucks.  There wasn't a laugh to be had in the first 20 to 30 minutes of the TV version of that movie.  Yeah, they had to cut everything out.  All the funny stuff just cut out.  It's inappropriate.  Uh, we have a weird theme going on today because, you know, the World Series has happened.  Of course, you know, the Red Sox won game two.  They're up 2-0. 
[00:50:00]  Um, so we're kind of playing national anthems and stuff.  Yeah.  They're coming in.  We got two more.  Uh, let's not forget, last night on 30 Rock, our pal Tracy Morgan, he's on fire with this 30 Rock.  He really is.  He'll never be on our show again because he's just becoming a huge star again.  But they had a quick clip of him doing the national anthem on 30 Rock.  This is the whole bit right here.  It's literally 18 seconds long.  Who brought stars and bright stars to the party last night for the rescue's report? 
[00:50:30]  Who ever knew when it was so many words?  Because it was like a most deaf CD.  Who ever knew?  But that's what happens when these people sing the national anthem.  They don't realize that it's a, first of all, it's a really hard song to sing.  Yeah.  I've heard that forever.  Like, uh, whoever wrote this song should be shot.  Yeah.  He should have been, he should have been, thank you. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  I should have came up with the name.  He should have been shot because it's a really hard song to hit all the notes.  And then there's too many words in the damn thing.  Yeah.  The song kind of, kind of, you know, catches up to you.  And it's words that like are oldie words.  Yeah.  A bunch of oldie time words.  Ramparts.  Yeah.  We got a very good example of that.  I'm sorry.  Do we know?  They're not going on, are they?  No, no, no, no.  Okay.  I got it all under control here.  He rocks on hold.  We're going to talk to him in a minute or two.  Dance Friday starts at 730.  Girl wins contests to sing national anthem at a basketball game. 
[00:51:30]  And like we just said, the song, after a while, just catches up to you.  And then this happens.  Oh, say can you see by the Johnson.  She started really high.  So far, so good, though.  What so proudly we hailed at the starlight.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:52:00]  Oh.  You know what?  At the stars.  I got season tickets for the Islanders, and, you know, they bring out a different person  to sing this every, you know, every home game.  And I think anyone that goes to a sporting event, you secretly hope this happens during  the singing of the national anthem.  Which is kind of sacrilege, because they're singing for America, but you don't want to  sit there and hear it, really.  You know?  And you're hoping there's a breakdown like this. 
[00:52:30]  Stop.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Exactly.  Starlight last year.  What?  Twilight?  That's gleaming.  Whose broad stripes and bright stars.  Boo.  Through the perilous fight.  Oh, the ramparts we watched  Were so gallantly streaming 
[00:53:00]  Oh, everyone's singing along it.  And the rock is red light  And the rock is red light  And they have bombs.  Gave proof through the night  That our flag was still there  Oh, say does that star-spangled  And the air wave 
[00:53:30]  For the lands of the free  And the rock is red light  Special Olympics  There you go.  Just walk off in shame.  We should pull her.  Now we're getting requests for Carl Lewis.  A lot of people saying  Nothing beats the Carl Lewis version.  I don't think I've ever heard that.  I haven't either.  Oh, you got it?  Oh, yeah.  All right, let's go to your podcast.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:54:00]  E.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  You're at Jill TV Channel 11  Here in New York City?  Yeah, we're here.  We're waiting to go on  In about 20 minutes or so.  This thing is already a disaster.  Why?  All right, well, we get in the cab to leave  And Poe spends the entire cab ride  Trying to explain to the cabbie  How the radio works  To put on 92.3  Because Poe's are friends of ours.  Oh, God.  What an ass.  Yeah.  So then we get here 
[00:54:30]  And there's a problem  Because Poe's not on the guest list.  So they're like,  Well, we got a phone call up  To see if he's allowed up there.  I'm used to that.  Right.  So they get him upstairs and everything.  We get into the  They put us in a dressing room here.  Poe has a backpack that he opens up  And there's this wrapped up towel  Which he then unfurled on the couch  And there's a whole line of products.  Oh.  What happened?  Can you get E? 
[00:55:00]  That was completely my fault.  Oh, no.  Wow.  I'm sorry.  735 says Steve.  Okay.  Can you get E rock back?  That was completely my fault.  Oh, no.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  We'll get him back on.  Mike in Jersey, what's up?  Real fast.  Yeah.  You guys are a couple of dumbasses  And especially Anthony.  What?  The Fast Times at Richmond High  It's when he's washed in the car.  That's what American Girl is playing.  Oh, okay.  Dude, I haven't seen it in a while. 
[00:55:30]  I love how you say especially Anthony  Because I would put Anthony up against anyone  When it comes to movie and TV trivia.  That's right.  In World War II.  I forgot.  You know, we're doing far trivia.  That's as a goof.  But we will do movie, TV trivia versus Anthony  Anytime.  And put up a huge prize if you can beat him.  A huge prize.  The pressure's on.  And you'd have to come in studio  So we know you're not Googling answers.  No one would beat Anthony.  He'd choke like Cindy Brady.  Oh, I know.  I'd just stare. 
[00:56:00]  That rude Anthony.  I don't know.  Actually, you know what?  My brother might be able to beat you.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, he might be able to beat you.  He hasn't had a job in over 10 years.  Watched a lot of TV.  Watched TV and watched movies.  He really hasn't had a job in 10 years?  I don't think so.  Wow.  10 years.  No, actually, longer.  Wow.  Follow him.  I don't know.  Get a gig.  See ya.  Get a gig.  Thanks, Mike, for helping us out.  Back to E-Rock.  I'm sorry.  E-Rock.  So he opens up his bag and there's all sorts of products on the couch? 
[00:56:30]  He has his towel wrapped up that he unfurls on the couch and there's all these products.  Yeah.  So first he starts using the lint brush to clean his outfit.  Oh.  Then he has shoe polish and he's doing his shoes.  Because they show shoes on TV, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Well, my feet will be moving.  He's gelling his hair and then he tops it off by filling the room with Axe Body Spray.  Oh, no.  I love it.  And as of right now, they're in the guest room and Poe and Jill are coordinating our dance moves for the segment. 
[00:57:00]  See, is it true we also popped a Cialis?  We have not even, like, scratched the surface with this Master Poe.  We've spent a lot of time on E-Rock and some other people on the show.  But this Master Poe is from another planet.  Yeah.  He really is from another planet.  They don't know him as well on this side either because he's the XM security.  So a lot of the... 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  We've got to start developing him on this.  He's a trained killer.  So, E-Rock, how are you feeling?  All right.  They have another dance guest with us.  His name is Dancing Larry.  Apparently, he's a regular dancer at the Ranger Games at Madison Square Garden.  Oh, they're spicing it up for you.  Hey, you know, if you're in the same room with the Ranger fan, you know what you have to do, right, E-Rock?  I am your hero, after all.  You've got to punch that guy right in the face live on TV.  Punch him.  And then go and say, go, Islanders, go. 
[00:58:00]  And then I'll faint like Marie Osmond.  Yeah.  I feel bad for you because I think...  Well, Marie Osmond is saying it's because of the fires in California.  That's why she passed out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She got winded.  I think she's pregnant.  That's what the rumor was.  And I think she's...  I believe she's already had eight kids or something like that.  Eight kids?  Something like that, yeah.  She's a woman.  Surprised they don't just ask her to, like, hover her over with water.  All right.  Do a split. 
[00:58:30]  Fire her over.  The fire.  I know.  Hover her over.  I hear Jill in the background.  E-Rock, what's going on?  Poe and Jill are sitting here coordinating our dance moves to Paul Abdul Straight Up.  Right.  See, this is Jill.  She's part of the news game, but this is what she actually does.  We get the behind-the-scenes stuff.  Jill, would you like to go out back of FH Riley's?  Yes.  Hold on here.  Take it, boy.  Take it, boy.  Poe? 
[00:59:00]  Wow, Poe can take it.  Yeah.  You like to touch it, too.  Oh, boy.  There you go.  You know that Master Poe is going to become a huge TV star today.  You know that, right?  I know.  Yeah.  He's quirky enough where people are going to be like, wow, we've got to get this Master  Poe back.  Forever, girl.  You want to talk to Opie?  Sure.  Oh, I got to hear you.  Hello?  Hi, Jill.  Hi, Jill.  Hey, guys.  I'm very busy here trying to teach the boys a little dance routine.  How's it working?  It's going all right.  I don't know.  Poe's a little upset here.  He's in shock that he really has to do these moves. 
[00:59:30]  But he does.  He has no choice.  You're on my turf now, boys.  Jill, I like you because you're an honest woman.  We appreciate your honesty.  What do you think of Master Poe?  And don't hold back.  Well, right now, he's okay.  He's got to work on his moves a little bit better.  But I think he might get it.  He's actually got the whole beat down.  He's got some deep.  You know, E-Rock is a little shy.  He won't dance with me yet.  So I've got to run on TV.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, of course, because you've got to do traffic now. 
[01:00:00]  It's Jill TV.  This is the news.  No, she doesn't want to smell that phone anymore.  Right.  Walking into a septic thing.  Oh, poor E-Rock.  Are you?  All right, there goes Jill.  She'll be on TV now.  Hey, by the way, if you go to, is this on YouTube so people can play along at home if  they're at their computer?  Oh, that is great.  We do have E-Rock learning how to dance for his big TV appearance.  You know, we take this stuff very seriously.  We give you a little peek into the O&A lab.  And it's E-Rock getting dance lessons from Master Poe.  Master Poe will be on TV with E-Rock today. 
[01:00:30]  How did they get this video on YouTube?  It's called Retards Dancing on Elfie and Anthony.  Oh, is that horrible?  Why'd you call it that?  Because I figured that way we'll increase traffic because people will be like, oh man,  retards dancing.  Yeah.  There you go.  Okay.  And that video will be up on onaradio.com later on today.  Okay.  We're loving onaradio.com because guess what?  It's a website dedicated to actually the fun things happening on a radio show. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, how about that?  God forbid we just focus on like positive stuff that a radio show is doing.  That's why we're pumping the hell out of onaradio.com, including Stephen S. from Bayshore's show rundowns.  All right.  Yes, they're brilliant.  All right.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  All right.  So you guys are going on in what?  Like 15 minutes?  Probably a little bit closer to 10.  Oh, I almost cursed.  All right.  E-Rock.  All right.  We got to go.  We got to take a quick break so we do this live. 
[01:01:30]  Okay.  All right.  Damn it.  All right.  Thank you.  E-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  What was that?  We got to break.  All right.  All that just means we have to take a break.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take a break.  A break.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  When we get back, hopefully our buddy E-Rock will be on live TV with Jill for Dance Friday. 
[01:02:00]  And we're going to simulcast it and we'll comment.  Do a little commentary.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I'm sorry.  I messed up that, though.  I'm distracted today.  We got to go on a train after the show today.  We were going to come back with Straight Up by...  Oh, Paul Abdul.  Yeah.  E-Rock's song.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Actually, it's a very busy Friday.  We're moments away from watching E-Rock dance on live TV. 
[01:02:30]  It's Dance Friday on Channel 11.  Our pals over at Channel 11, they're huge, huge, huge fans of the Opie and Anthony show.  And what do we do in return?  We just beat them up.  We make fun of every single person that does the news for them, including the smug reporter.  That's the new one.  The new guy that we've really taken to is Smug Guy.  Do you know his name?  I think it's James Ford.  James Ford. 
[01:03:00]  James Ford.  We just call him Smug Guy.  Yeah.  He gets on in the morning, and he's doing stories like...  I'll give you a couple of examples.  Is he the blonde guy?  No.  No.  He's a black guy.  But he was...  Actually.  He was doing a story on the signs that are on the parkways now around New York, around  Long Island, that tells you how long it's going to take you to get from where you are to a  landmark.  Let's say the Verrazano Bridge or another exit down the expressway, something like that. 
[01:03:30]  And he was talking about how they weren't working.  But he gets this face that he puts on that's kind of like, yeah, well, these signs aren't  going to work, and then they had him at the new Prudential Center over there in Newark.  I think they're calling it The Rock.  The Rock, they call it, yeah.  Big concert venue in Newark.  The Rock.  Bon Jovi was there for their inauguration last night.  With all the Sopranos.  Yeah.  A bunch of the Sopranos, a lot of celebrities. 
[01:04:00]  But he was there, this reporter, smug guy, we like to call him.  He was there the morning of the show.  Which was yesterday.  Yeah, yesterday.  Talking about how, you know, if you look inside the window, there's still a crane.  They're still doing work.  Are they even going to be done?  And the lights said, like, the Dential-er.  Like, as some letters were missing, he goes, all the lights aren't even working in the name.  And then he goes, back to you, and makes his face like he's kind of like, like he's just 
[01:04:30]  aggravated with everything he's talking about.  And they got a concert tonight.  Concert tonight.  I don't know if they're going to be able to pull this off.  He's our new guy, man.  So when he comes on, we stop everything we're doing in the office and we go, oh, smug guy,  smug guy.  Yeah, we're, I mean, we love him.  Yeah.  Five of the, I mean, five in the morning, you just find things to entertain yourself.  Let's say hi to Jen on Long Island. 
[01:05:00]  We got a minute or two before E-Rock's on.  Maybe not.  We might have to go right to TV here.  Jen, what do you got for the radio show?  Hi.  Hi, Jen.  How are you?  I'm really good.  As soon as it's on, just pot us up there, Danny.  All right.  Why are you calling the show?  Well, I heard your sound.  Yeah, you sure did.  Oh, boy.  You sure?  I'm a loser.  Did.  You suck!  You definitely heard.  Man, you are one pathetic loser. 
[01:05:30]  I heard the sound.  Idiot.  And I heard the sound.  Wrong.  Try again, you dumbass.  Huh?  Idiot.  Yeah, you heard that, right?  So you're trying to win the $1,000?  I certainly do.  This is going great.  Yeah.  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore.  You know it.  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore.  You heard the sound?  I did.  Oh, man.  You are one pathetic loser. 
[01:06:00]  How long have you been listening to the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, I'm a contester, and I don't really like you guys, so I listen to the money.  Oh.  Liar, you know something?  God bless you.  God bless you, Jan.  Finally, an honest answer.  I love talking to the price tag.  Finally, an honest answer.  Oh.  Oh, smug guy.  Smug guy.  Yeah, that's smug guy, but Jan.  What?  So your whole thing is you just go around the radio dial trying to win contests? 
[01:06:30]  She called herself the contester.  Huh?  I'm a contest whore.  Are you?  I go station to station, and I listen to your sound as I call up, and I...  And you're being completely honest.  You hate us, but you know we're giving away $1,000, so you figure, what the hell, I'll  listen just to try to win the $1,000, right?  Absolutely.  Hey, Jan, what have you won over the years?  I've won trips to Bahamas.  I've won thousands of dollars.  I won concert tickets. 
[01:07:00]  I saw you two in the heart.  I've done well for myself as well.  Wow.  I certainly have.  Is there any...  You know, on Friday, when you were making fun of, hey, Hans, Scott Dialing?  Yeah.  You were talking about me.  Oh, and is there any chance that you'll become a listener of the Opie and Anthony show  after the contest is over?  Um...  Probably not, unless you have a prize.  Yeah?  Just prizes, huh?  There's nothing we can do...  Nothing we've done that's made you go like, oh, that's kind of interesting, or something? 
[01:07:30]  Anything?  Any redeeming...  Sometimes, guys, you make me laugh.  All right.  Hey, hey, uh...  I like to sing on Bible stories on, uh, Friday.  Oh, that was fun, with the Harry Potter is just as, uh...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Bible is just as bad as a Harry Potter book?  Yeah.  Hey, Jen.  I wanted not to like it, but I found myself laughing.  Oh, thank you.  Well, that's what we're hoping.  Some of you prize pigs actually continue listening to our show.  Now, Jen, what's the next prize you're hoping to win? 
[01:08:00]  Because I know these people.  They have charts and stuff.  What's the next contest you're going to be jumping onto?  Wait, I want the Antigua thing on CBS.  Antigua, huh?  See, these...  Yeah, I want to go to Antigua.  This is a look into the prize pigs' life.  This is all they do.  So you're going to go...  A contest on CBS is going to start where they're giving away trips to Antigua?  Yeah, they're doing that now.  And then what else?  What else is out there that you're trying to win?  Is that about it right now?  Actually, right now, I wanted to win cruise tickets, but the radio stations were going to 
[01:08:30]  cheap with that.  They didn't give that many away for them.  Oh, those bastards, right?  See, I...  Oh, yeah.  We explained this at the beginning of the contest.  People like Jen, they got charts and they got a bunch of phones.  Oh, yeah.  And they just set up every day and get ready to try to win something.  Actually, my husband does that.  I'm just his bimmy.  You know, hey, hon, dial?  All right.  Hey, Jen, I hate to tell you, but you're the 11th caller.  Yeah, you just missed.  You just missed on this one.  It was fun talking to you.  Usually, we beat up the prize pigs, but you know what?  I can't beat up someone that's just being blatantly honest. 
[01:09:00]  Complete honesty.  I don't like you.  I'm just calling for the money.  There's nothing more honest than that.  All right, Jen.  See you later.  You're a radio hooker.  That's right.  Pretty much.  And it's grand.  All right.  Have fun, guys.  Give us a call soon.  We want to say hi to Nick in Michigan.  Nick?  Hey.  $1,000, buddy.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Nice.  What are you going to do with the $1,000?  Oh, I've got some definite lawyer bills to pay off.  Oh, God.  What a waste. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, don't you hate that?  Lawyer bills for what?  Oh, divorce.  You know that one, Anthony.  That's great.  Well, congrats.  All right.  Well, thank you, sir.  We've got to kind of move along because at any second now, we're going to simulcast with  Channel 11, our friends at Channel 11 here in New York.  All right?  Hey, you guys.  Have fun, then.  Congratulations.  That's Nick from Michigan.  He won the $1,000 today.  We'll play another sound in a little while, and that'll be the sound you're looking for  on Monday between 7 and 7.30.  Okay?  I just... 
[01:10:00]  Why, why?  I can't...  The anticipation is killing me.  Oh, I know.  Of the thought of our own E-Rock in E-Rock-tober.  Yeah.  And Master Poe dancing.  Yeah.  I hope I'm not just wetting myself and I can describe some of the action.  And by the way, for the people out there, don't wait for our cue.  We're on a bit of a delay, a little bit of a delay, so you might want to, you know,  check it out if you're in the area.  And then we'll get the video up on onaradio.com.  Oh, yeah.  So the rest of America can enjoy the silliness that is E-Rock and Master Poe. 
[01:10:30]  He's probably such a nervous Nelly right now.  Yeah.  I think it's official because Tim has come up with a sweeper.  He hasn't come up with a sweeper in a while, but here it is.  It's Fart Friday.  Fart Friday.  Fart Friday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Where did Fart Friday come from?  I wrote it down.  I remember the spark of creativity.  No, I like the contest idea. 
[01:11:00]  I said Fart Friday, too.  That's going to be Fart Friday.  Yes.  Because that guy, the guy farted.  Yeah.  Are you doing the show with me?  The guy farted on the phones.  And I looked at my paper.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Fart Friday.  And then Tim, this is how the process works.  Then Tim ran down the hall and made a sweeper, and now it's officially Fart Friday.  That's how it happened.  No, I assumed that the guy that was on the phone was trying to audition for the contest.  No, he just had a fart.  Oh, okay.  That he was holding in.  Well, kind of hard to keep track of all the days. 
[01:11:30]  Well, now, I mean, now what you're talking about is the other sweeper Tim came up with.  Yeah.  This is what you're correct about.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Fart Trivia.  Opie and Anthony will ask you a question.  The buzzer comes from you.  Fart Trivia.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we'll have more details on that in coming day.  So we got the Fart Trivia happening, and we also have Fart Friday.  Of course we do. 
[01:12:00]  Jimmy's partaking.  You want to play games?  Well, they did seem to be smiling on the news.  I'm wondering if they were all setting up.  Maybe Eric grabbed his chest and fell face first on the floor.  Happy.  Poor Iraq.  Poor stupid Iraq.  Poor Iraq.  Blubbery mess.  You know, he's not even going to be the highlight today.  Master Poe is going to upstage him on TV. 
[01:12:30]  And no one really knows Master Poe yet.  You know what it is?  It's two complete opposites.  It's one guy that thinks he rules, and he's going to be, with all the confidence in the  world, he's going to be dancing like a complete buffoon.  Yeah.  And then there's the other one that is yet nervous in his own skin, has no rhythm.  All right, turn this up.  Turn this up.  Happy surprise to you for this dance Friday.  All right, check it in here right now.  Oh, no.  The Williamsburg Bridge, some heavy traffic.  Oh, no.  All right, this is a little surprise for dance Friday.  The same Jill we just heard on the phone. 
[01:13:00]  Getting the guys ready for dance Friday.  Yeah.  That's why traffic building.  Traffic, blah, blah, blah, traffic.  Black picture coming right up at the BQE.  Northbound, right between the Gawans Canal and the Brooklyn Bridge.  Iraq is probably freaking out.  It's a little bit sluggish from the LIE into the Kosciuszko.  Was Iraq wearing a green shirt?  I hope so.  When they put the chroma key background, he disappears.  All sides are in effect today citywide.  I'm going to drop my magic wand.  Oh, no.  And welcome to Dance Friday. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, no.  All the way from the K-Rock Studios and XM Studios, let's welcome A-Rock.  That's right.  Ah!  That's right.  That's right.  Ah!  We have a little something special.  Let's get close.  Ready?  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Shake.  Hold it to one guys and we heard this.  Oh!  They are awful.  Yes, sir.  What?  Is that?  They're making complete fools of themselves on live TV. 
[01:14:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Shake their booty?  They're shaking their booty, yes.  We have a special surprise.  Oh, no.  They got boas on.  Woo-hoo!  Who's too sexy?  What's up?  Are you feeling sexy right now?  Oh, I'm feeling fantastic.  How is it?  Is it better than radio?  Woo-hoo!  Yeah? What do you want to say to Opie and Anthony?  Jim, everyone's watching. What do you want to say?  Thank you so much for this opportunity  for E-Rocktober.  Opie and Anthony, 6 a.m., 92.3 K-Rock. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, look at them.  That's right, baby, right here.  Love you guys.  He rocks to the front.  I felt their career skyrocketing.  Thank you very much, guys, for coming in.  52 degrees.  You know how bad they want you at a studio  where they thank you on air?  Thank you for coming in.  In other words, just leave.  All right, listen, we're going to get that video up  because I know we're talking to people in other cities  that didn't get to see that,  so we'll put it up on onaradio.com later on today. 
[01:15:00]  Well, people, though, that did see it,  oh, my God, I S myself.  Oh, my God, I'm crying.  Holy S, I'm crying.  Poe looked like the Count from Sesame Street.  That was hysterical.  The Count.  The Count.  He gets to one, and he's stuck.  Oh, they're calling it Dunce Friday.  Thank you.  Nice feather boa. 
[01:15:30]  You fruits.  Bird and Philly, I'm in tears, and I can't even see this.  The best part was when they first walked out,  the look on Poe's face.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he had that, like, just stoic and ready-to-take-care-of-business look,  the dumb face on him.  I totally felt that shared embarrassment feeling is another post.  Everyone, this is going through so fast, trying to read these.  A lot of people saw it.  All right, get E-Rock on the phone, eh?  Classic TV.  Yeah.  The dancing mayo jar was hysterical. 
[01:16:00]  Douche chill TV.  The Hack Street Boys.  We got Randy in New Orleans.  Randy, what's up?  Hey, man.  E-Rock October was fantastic, and the prospect of expanding Master Poe would be great.  Can we move into Poe-Vember?  Poe-Vember?  Poe-Vember, mate.  Wow, that's a good idea.  That's a great idea.  We're doing Poe-Vember.  We got to bring all the classic.  You got one of the classic Poe clips, don't you? 
[01:16:30]  Where is it?  Him singing, ba-na-na-na-na-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Can we get that to start promoting Poe-Vember?  We'll get that for after the break.  Poe looked like a dancing, praying mantis.  He did look like Count Count.  That was a great call.  Oh, God.  Let's get the star of the show.  It's E-Rock, everybody.  Oh, E-Rock.  Fresh off his Dance Friday appearance on Channel 11 here in New York City.  E-Rock.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey. 
[01:17:00]  We got a nice ovation as soon as the bit was done.  It was...  You looked ridiculous.  But I got the plug out, so that's good.  I don't like how he's feeling good about himself right now.  He's feeling a little bit confident.  Yeah, I think so.  It started getting good to you while you were dancing.  I could see your face.  You relaxed a little.  Yeah.  It was a lot of fun.  It was a lot of fun, was it?  And Poe didn't upstage you, by the way.  No.  I know.  He tripped over his own foot.  Did he really?  I can't wait to analyze that tape. 
[01:17:30]  I'm going to watch it 80 times.  Wait, where did he trip?  He was looking down when he was doing his bouncing, and he went to step to the right,  and he hit his own foot, and almost kicked out Jill.  And look, there's Jill just hanging out in a green...  Yeah.  Yeah, she wants to say hello.  All right, it's Jill from Jill TV, everybody.  Jill.  Hello, everyone.  Hi, Jill.  Well, for those of you that got to see, how did you think the boys did?  I think you did a wonderful job.  It was fun. 
[01:18:00]  The boa thing, though.  You're killing my guys.  That was great.  You're killing our guys here with that boa thing.  Good.  They loved it.  They loved it.  We loved it.  What about the dancing?  Did you think they did a good job?  Do you know what it was?  I'll be honest.  The music came in a little too early, so we were all a little bit off in the beginning.  But I'm going to give them all golden stars today.  You guys did fantastic.  Woo!  Woo!  This is the news.  Jill, this isn't a bar in Long Island. 
[01:18:30]  This is the news.  The news.  This isn't Thirsty Thursdays.  This is the news.  Dance Friday, my friend.  Hey, Jill, did you notice that Eric started to get comfortable?  Yeah, he started getting into it, and he was, like, bopping his head, and his...  Yeah, he felt very comfortable.  Yeah, he was front and center, giving out the plug, kind of feeling good.  Yeah.  A comfortable look on his dumb face.  It really bothered me.  Yeah.  And officially, E-Rock has done more TV than Anthony and I now, so that's...  Yep.  That's good, too. 
[01:19:00]  Well, you guys are next, because you know I'm recruiting you all to the show.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, the whole morning show.  That's right, guys.  You will come on and do Dance Friday.  That'll be the day.  Would you have Opie and Anthony do Dance Friday?  Shut up, Jimmy.  I'm just saying, maybe you would.  You're trying to instigate.  Well, what about Jimmy Norton?  Nah, I've already been on his old hat.  Jimmy Norton.  I'm saying you guys.  She said, of course, Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, of course.  I have a bad foot.  You guys.  I got a knee injury coming up.  I'm not telling you.  It's Friday.  Feel it.  We'll bring a camera crew to the station, and what we'll do is we'll film you guys, and 
[01:19:30]  we'll just broadcast it here, so you guys don't have to get out of the studio.  It'll be perfect.  I think we're off that day.  Maybe we could dance while we're still sitting, you know, that type of thing.  What about Dan?  Share a dance.  We'll put our hands in the air like we just don't care.  Would you ask, Jill?  What?  Yeah, we want him in next.  Dan?  Yes.  Oh, Than.  What about it?  Dance Friday.  They want you in next.  No?  No.  Why not?  Than's looking, the only way I could describe it, horrified. 
[01:20:00]  Maybe for Thanuary.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  Did you guys like the butt shake?  They want to know if you like your butt shake.  A lot.  I'm proud of the butt shake.  Um, I gotta be honest with you, when that part came up, I was not looking at either  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Or Poe.  Yeah.  We all passed the gay test.  Let's just put it that way.  Well, thank you.  That's a compliment.  And a nice choreography, by the way.  Yeah, you worked that out pretty quickly. 
[01:20:30]  I didn't know you actually worked out dance steps for this.  Oh, absolutely.  I used to be a professional choreographer, so I took a little of my fantastic moves, some  of the best moves that you've seen in the 80s.  You know, a little hip swing, a little booty shake, and a little Egyptian thing we got  in there, too, right?  Yeah, I saw that.  Like a little bangle thing.  Do you think that Poe actually thinks that he's a little bit of a better dancer than he  is?  Yeah, I think Poe thinks he is a better dancer than he is.  You know what he did, like, during rehearsal?  He was like, five, six, seven, eight, and one, two, and he knows how to count. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, he knows how to count.  Where did that come from?  Was he trying to flirt with you at all?  Actually, he asked me for my number just a few minutes ago.  Did he really?  Yeah, he wants to go out.  All right.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, my God.  I hope you didn't give it to him.  Hey, Jill, how long did it take Poe to actually hit on you?  About six minutes, I'd say. 
[01:21:30]  Was he trying to be charming, but he came off just like a ghoul?  No, you know what?  We bonded over the Long Island thing.  Like, you know, we all bond over Long Island.  It was like, wow.  Master Poe's from Jersey.  Master Poe's not from Long Island.  He's banged a few broads from Long Island in parking lots, but he's a Jersey guy.  Did he laugh at all?  Like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's exactly what he just did.  It sounds like the count.  Look at us just sea-blocking him.  I just think it's hilarious that she has absolutely nothing to do but hang out with 
[01:22:00]  us in between her traffic reports.  As long as the traffic gets out there.  That's right.  Sorry, I'll be back to check you in on your New York and New Jersey roadways in just a  moment, people.  Don't worry.  I'll be back.  Look, I've got to go do my very important job right now.  You know what?  It's time to get serious.  The Jill Nicolini serious face, I've got to go back to work. 
[01:22:30]  All right, Jill.  Go ahead.  Tell us where the traffic is.  Thanks, Jill.  Have a great weekend.  Jill from Jill TV, everyone.  Is Iraq here still?  Iraq.  Yeah, we lost Iraq.  All right.  All right.  You know what?  This is the next one right here.  Clutch in Baltimore has the next person that should be doing Dance Friday.  Clutch.  Big setup with no payoff.  Clutch.  Hello, Clutch.  Well, all I'll do is line.  Roland should do Dance Friday.  Yes.  Oh, Roland. 
[01:23:00]  Roland is so uncomfortable in his skin.  That would rock.  And on TV, that sweaty forehead of his will just be a nice little extra treat for everybody.  Let's go to Dave on Long Island.  Dave, what's up?  How you doing?  Hey.  Instead of a boa, they should have given him a towel.  Eric's was soaking wet on him.  Was he all sweaty?  See, I got to see it again now.  I think the C came out in that one. 
[01:23:30]  I said, I got to see that again.  Oh, wow.  Like, I got to watch it 80 times just to get, I'm going to laugh just as hard the last time.  It went by way too fast.  Way too fast.  Eric was the biggest thing on television.  All right, Dave.  Take care.  The little Ralph Cramden joke.  Let's go to Michelle in Jersey.  Michelle.  Hey.  Hey.  How are you?  Huh?  I didn't even see it.  I was laughing hysterically driving.  Yeah, because.  You guys should do Dance Friday. 
[01:24:00]  I agree.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, of course you agree, Jimmy.  There is no way.  I want to see my friends having fun.  Ever.  Well, you want to see us having fun?  Yeah.  It will not be during a Dance Friday segment.  Boogie Woogie.  You will not.  Boogie Woogie.  Huh?  There will be no Boogie Woogie.  I think you would get more listeners that way than this $1,000.  I think it would be fun.  People would see the fun side of the show and the fact that the guys are just silly geese.  Yeah, there you go. 
[01:24:30]  It was silly geese.  I don't think it would be silly geese.  I think it would.  That is a career ender right there.  Ender.  I thought XFL pregame was the career ender.  Right.  Thank you, Michelle.  I want to see Steve do it, too.  Steve and Roland should be next.  Roland would just be like, I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  Is Roland coming in today?  Maybe we could have a little dance tryout with Roland today, and we'll add that video 
[01:25:00]  up on some of the sites as well.  We're going to do this again.  It's for Christ.  Fart Friday.  Fart Friday.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Tim.  We've got a mark in Connecticut.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I finally got through.  Yeah.  Long time listener.  First time caller.  Okay.  Quack, quack.  Never mind friggin' dance Friday. 
[01:25:30]  It's all about fart Friday.  Yes.  Well.  Yeah.  I got about a half hour commute, and I drink my coffee on the way, and by the time I get  to work, man, it's like beeline straight to the bathroom, you know?  Oh, yeah.  But if you give me one sec, I think I got one.  Good for you.  All right.  Hang on.  I'm going to try here.  I'm going to try not to try my pants.  Oh, boy.  Thank you.  Oh, shit.  Gee, dude.  I got to say, I got to say.  Dude. 
[01:26:00]  I got a message for Jimmy, though.  Yeah.  Jimmy Norton.  Go ahead.  I love you, man.  Thank you.  We caught your stand-up on friggin' HBO the other night, and that was by far the most  hilarious, disgustingly vile crap I've ever seen.  Thank you.  That was so funny.  Everybody was dying, even my girlfriend, who doesn't like, you know.  Me.  Like you.  She doesn't like you.  Thanks, man.  A Bassett hound wearing a miner's helmet?  Come on.  Thank you, buddy.  Perfect. 
[01:26:30]  All right.  Very good, Mark.  And unfortunately, no one heard your fart because you cursed after it.  Yes.  So you got to.  I'm sorry.  On this side of the show, you got to kind of keep it clean so we can get some of this  stuff out there.  But thank you, Mark.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  I'll try again tomorrow.  All right.  And we're going to attempt to do this fart trivia.  We just got to figure out how it's going to work.  What do you got over there, Danny?  Well, do you remember back on XM a couple years ago, we played something called the  fart game?  What was that?  Where you and Jim seemed to have a competition for quite some time where every time you had  one, you would let it go into the mics.  Why isolate it?  Well, we all actually isolated them. 
[01:27:00]  And I played a game to see if you could identify.  Oh, whose was whose.  Right.  Right.  What do you got?  Just highlights of that?  Well, I have some of the actual ones that you guys let go if you want to hear.  All right.  Yeah.  Considering it is Fart Friday.  All right.  Let me see.  All right.  Well, we got this one.  All right.  Listen, I this is.  All right.  Go ahead.  Let me do that one.  Back up again.  That's me.  It's all.  I remember that one.  It definitely was.  All right.  Here's another one.  Here's those firm cheeks. 
[01:27:30]  That's me.  No.  That's Jimmy.  That's Jimmy.  Because I tend to push a little harder.  You're forgetting.  I push a little harder than Jimmy.  Let's see.  I got another one here.  We're just guessing.  No.  We're probably right.  Go ahead.  I think that was me.  Any other guesses?  Well, the only other guess was Jimmy going me.  Oh, for me.  I mean, geez.  Danny, this isn't rocket science. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, that was Jim.  All right.  Let's see.  I got another one.  That was me.  I think that might be my favorite.  That's definitely me.  It is.  Yeah.  Here's another one.  Wow.  It's amazing.  It's like fingerprints or snowflakes.  Right.  That was me with the Ebola virus carrying my intestines out. 
[01:28:30]  I got more.  All right.  I'm sure.  That's you again.  I know mine for the most part.  That's so mine.  Yours are bassy.  Right.  You could do like, if there was voiceover for that.  Yeah.  You got like a good tone.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm not sure about that one.  I would say Jimmy.  Was it Jimmy?  Yeah, because it's almost cute and uplifting. 
[01:29:00]  Like, yeah, that, yeah, that, all right.  Nope.  That was open.  Wow.  Okay.  I could have played the game over again with the same.  I know.  I know.  Okay.  Who's this?  I think I got one more.  One more.  Let's go.  Actually, one or two more.  All right.  Do it again.  So disgusting.  I think that's Jimmy.  It had to be because you laughed too soon. 
[01:29:30]  Go ahead.  One more time.  I thought I could hear your laugh.  Yeah.  So you couldn't be laughing.  I would have to go with Jimmy on that.  No, that's, uh, that's Ope.  Oh, wow.  What the hell, man?  Ope is laughing during it.  Wow.  I think I have one more.  That was the same one, I think.  All right.  Enough.  We recognize him now.  Yeah.  Dennis from Long Island has an observation as far as what he saw on TV a few minutes ago.  Dennis, go ahead. 
[01:30:00]  Hey, bu-bu-bu-boys.  Yep.  I don't know if anybody saw, but when Jill had Master Poe roll it one ways, and when  E-Rock was rolling it back, he had his eyes on the prize.  And, uh, was, uh, an attempted, uh, grab.  You think he was trying to grab her, her boob?  Uh, or at least a brush against, uh, you gotta look at it pretty close.  I watched it about 12 times myself.  All right.  Well, uh, yeah, we gotta watch that video again.  When is it gonna be up?  We gotta get that up immediately. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, I'll do it.  Is one of the guys around here, uh, able to get that up on onaradio.com?  Yeah, I'll just, I gotta cut it down and send it to him.  All right, cool.  It'll be up within an hour.  All right, great.  Good.  All right, thank you, sir.  Hey, we're thinking of, we're thinking of doing Poe Vember.  Because Master Poe is a character that a lot of people still don't know about.  And he, the beauty of Poe, he gives us stuff like this.  Hey, this is Master Poe.  Poe, Poe, boo-boe, banana-nana, banana-fana, fo-fo, fee-fi-mo-mo. 
[01:31:00]  Poe!  Poe!  Wonderful sound clip, too.  Yeah, I don't know if I got it on this side.  Damn!  Yeah.  All right, well.  You do have it, I think.  Huh?  I think that should be a sound of the day.  Of course, it's gonna be.  It absolutely will be.  Poe is, um...  Well, how about...  Very unique, uh, character.  I'm watching Poe.  Here he is.  He really is trying to dance.  And he keeps going out of frame. 
[01:31:30]  Damn!  You've just been pwned!  I think we should use a Master Poe clip for Monday's contest.  Yeah.  All right, I think I got it.  All right.  I don't want to confuse everybody.  Ignore the ones we just played.  This is the sound to listen for on Monday between 7 and 7.30 if you want to win $1,000.  When you hear that, on Monday sometime between 7 and 7.30, be the 10th caller, you'll win 
[01:32:00]  the next $1,000.  Yes, Danny?  Well, I'm re-watching the video of Poe and Eric dancing, and I just caught something that  just infuriated me.  We told them to purposely wear Opie and Anthony shirts to try and get the name out there on  TV.  Yeah.  Poe's wearing his friggin' suit jacket over the shirt so that you can't read what it says.  You can't read what it says.  Because he wanted to look good for his appearance on TV.  This is my big shot.  You know what bugs me about the Poe thing, too, is he's actually dancing and smiling, and 
[01:32:30]  there's nothing worse than a guy smiling while he's dancing.  They looked anything but cool.  Yeah.  I really have to be honest.  All right.  Well, the video will be up for everybody else in a little while, hopefully.  But once again, here's the sound for Monday between 7 and 7.30.  Listen for this.  This is what it says.  Oh, my God.  No.  That's wrong.  Here it is.  Sorry. 
[01:33:00]  There you go.  And that sound will be up on onaradio.com if there's any kind of confusing.  Right.  Confusion.  Nah.  All right.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, someone get the Halle Berry apology coming in on this.  What a doodle-y.  We'll explain the story, but get her apology.  He said something inappropriate on tonight's show.  I'd like to apologize to the Jews. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Oh, really?  It was so who gives a crap, but that's the times we live in now.  This day and age.  She had to go and apologize.  We'll explain in a minute, but we'll get the apology.  It's up on instant feedback.  Phil N., thank you for sending that in from Jersey.  Let's say hi to Paul on Long Island.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, there, Paul.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  And I was wondering, do you have trouble not answering back on Fox Friday?  Yeah.  I keep looking around. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, you're lingering longer.  Thinking someone's talking to me.  We'll get that for, I don't think we've ever played that on this side of the show, but  I guess we can give it away.  There was a moment on the other side of the show where Jimmy farted and then went, what?  What?  Did someone say something?  Yeah.  I don't know if it was the tone of it or something happened.  It just, I kind of thought somebody was talking.  And then it became a big thing.  We were calling it, what, the fart whisperer?  Yeah.  That I talk to them.  I know what they are about. 
[01:34:30]  I got to tell you, this is like, we work so hard on this radio show.  Oh, my goodness.  Even though people don't think we do.  Ha ha.  We get it.  But then you just come up with something just so dumb, like Fart Friday, and that's all  people want to talk about now.  Of course.  Let's go to Brother Dave.  He's from Hempstead, Long Island.  He's Steve C's uncle.  The famous Steve S.  Oh, really?  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Right there, Brother Dave? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, man.  Um, my birds, they, you know, when I fart, they fart, and they know it makes me laugh.  What?  Uh, and, uh, you just started playing it, and I just got a symphony of farts from them.  It's just, I wanted to thank you for the laugh.  The parrot makes noises?  Makes...  I got five of them.  And they, you know, like, they, they mimic my farts, and they just heard all your farts on  the radio.  What's wrong with this family?  You should talk to them.  Can you get...  I got to get a recording so I can put it, so I can play it back to you.  That's great. 
[01:35:30]  Wait, can't you just, uh, do a fake fart and see what happens with the parrots?  Come here, babe.  Come here.  He's just gonna talk.  They don't, they won't do it.  You can hear them screaming?  Yeah.  They don't do it on command.  Hey, see if...  I was trying to...  What?  What's up?  Like, if you hold them on your finger, and if you're talking to them, what would he do  if you took your fist and just drilled it into a stupid bird chest?  Bird chest.  Birds.  Yeah, Jimmy, uh, we shouldn't talk about birds. 
[01:36:00]  Jimmy, uh, has a hatred of birds.  That's right.  You should bring one of the birds over your, uh, nephew's house so it could, uh, recite  old Nuremberg speeches.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I'm gonna see him in, I'm gonna see him in an hour or so, so.  Yeah, when you see him, can you thank him for, uh, for ruining the show with, uh, one  of his family members?  All right.  I'm funnier than him.  He's got this sense of humor from me.  No, brother Dave, we're, we're hoping for, this is, this sounds good, like your parrots,  uh, make fart noises, so I'm thinking, as a dopey radio guy here, wow, go to the phones 
[01:36:30]  and we get to hear parrots, uh, mimicking fart noises.  Mm-hmm.  People would laugh and laugh, go into work, talk about, oh my god, did you hear Opie  and Anthony, they had a parrot farting on the radio.  Gotta listen to those guys.  Parrots are so goddamn temperamental.  When you want them to talk, they never say what they're supposed to say.  You ever know someone with a parrot and they're like, oh, watch, you know, hello, hello,  and the thing just sits there looking at you, chewing on that stupid mirror that you gotta  put in their cage so they think they're with a friend?  Is that why they do that?  Dummies. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  There's a mirror in there so he can look at it and go, I got a pal, he looks like me.  They just sit there.  And they use their mouth to move around, their stupid little claws, and then they'll just  grab the cage with their mouth and slowly put a claw up on the side.  Yeah.  Ring their little bell, huh?  If I teach him to shit on you, would you like him first, then?  What's that?  I don't know.  Jim likes things to shit on him.  If I teach him to shit on you, would you like him, then?  No, you gotta... 
[01:37:30]  Once again, I want to thank Stephen S. from Bayshore for having a family member completely  shut down the Opie and Anthony show on this fine fart Friday.  Thank you, Stephen S.  All right, Brother Dave.  Thank you for...  Godspeed there.  ...for whatever you did.  Yes, take care.  Yeah.  That's good.  I know that that word was recently deemed inappropriate by the FCC in 1950.  But he dropped it three times in a row.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And in a way, we couldn't really hear it, so we asked him to repeat himself three times. 
[01:38:00]  That was great.  I heard it.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Hey, they're screaming at us because we mentioned the Carl Lewis singing of the National Anthem  because we kind of have that theme going on today as well.  Yeah.  Also, I think Tom's dead for the Is Tom Alive fans.  Here's Carl Lewis.  Oh, say, can you see?  By the dawn's early light. 
[01:38:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Lying.  When so proudly we hail at the twilight's last gleaming.  Who bright stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight for the ramparts we watched 
[01:39:00]  were so gallantly streaming.  And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave tooth to the night that our flag was still. 
[01:39:30]  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  Or stay, does that star-spangled banner yet wave?  For the land  And of the free  And the home 
[01:40:00]  Of the brave  Ah, I see  Big ending  United we stand  Thank you  Yeah  That fit in great on Fart Friday  Because that stunk up the joint  I knew he was going to say four  It's an O and an apostrophe E  Yeah, that's how they kind of spoke  What the hell do you know about America  The fact that you brought a few gold medals home  Or  There you go 
[01:40:30]  Is there a video anywhere  What was that  Tom, what was that  That's not Carl Lewis  Alright  Thank you Tom  What, is Carl Lewis even worse than that  Who was that then  We got to label this Carl Lewis  That was pretty entertaining too  Who was that  What do you know about the Carl Lewis one Tom  Damn  I want Carl Lewis  The Carl Lewis one is famous  Because his voice cracks  Nine million different times during it 
[01:41:00]  And  And  And not because he misses lyrics  It's that there is no tonal quality  In his voice  Well that guy didn't exactly have  His voice sounded good  His voice sounded good  Compared to Carl Lewis  Oh see now  Look what you got to look forward to  Now where's  Where's the Carl Lewis  Now we got to find the Carl Lewis  It's got to be on a website somewhere  Now we got to find the Carl Lewis  And figure out who the hell that last guy was  Yeah  Well cause that was pretty interesting too  Yeah I liked him  I was hoping for a little more  He had a good style  No it was really bad  Alright we'll find it  That's someone who thought he could sing 
[01:41:30]  And really try to give it that big ending  Right  Who the hell sang this song  The National Anthem  Like  Whitney Houston  Remember that  And she had like the huge hit with it  During wartime  And then  Yeah it was during the first Gulf War  And then ever since then  Was that at the Superbowl  Everybody has just been trying to get that hit version of it  By doing these vocal aerobics  During the National Anthem  Just sing the song  Her version was so amazing  They released it as a single  Yeah  An hour later 
[01:42:00]  Like an hour later  Like you could get  Well it's okay  Cause they had the recording sitting there  She had lip sync to it  Oh yeah good point  Thank you Tom  Thanks Tom  That was terrific  Clearing that up  Always a pleasure  When you add something to our fine radio show  Well at least we thought it was Carl Lewis  We look like ass  We look like E-Rock and Poe man  The E to the rock  The big TV star is back in studio  Is he  Hopefully we'll have the video up on  O-N-A radio dot com 
[01:42:30]  In the next few minutes  There he is  Please get it up there as quickly  As is humanly possible  E-Rock  Here he is  The big star of Dance Friday  It was fun  Was it fun?  Yeah  Was Jill cordial?  Um  At times  But if I could get past Master Poe talking to her  Ah  Okay now  Was Poe really putting the moves on her  And asked for her number?  She was trying to coordinate our dance  Yeah  Sure  And Poe was taken upon himself  To maybe show some improvements 
[01:43:00]  To the routine  Jill  I think I could help you  Maybe a few combat moves  He's outside  He actually  He's asking if he can plug something  Oh  I don't know  Mouth with a shotgun  Oh boy  Oh boy  Jim  Why do I have a feeling  That there's a woman involved in this?  Ah  I want to plug something  Poe take your time  There he is  No problem  Hi Poe  We're on your time  It's the Poe  You just take your time 
[01:43:30]  And just saunter in here  Don't worry that there's a million people  Waiting for us to do something  Good morning gentlemen  Yeah good morning  Oos  Good job  I was horrible  How did that feel?  So you tripped a little bit  I was horrible  I think I was stepping on my own toes  You tripped over your own toes  It happens though  You're nervous  The cameras are rolling  And instead of being graceful  You almost tripped and wrecked everything for everybody  Absolutely  What do you think of that Jill Nicolini over there?  She's very nice 
[01:44:00]  Yeah  And her dance steps are different  And difficult  But  Oh  Yeah real difficult  Basic dance moves from the 90s  Real difficult  Yeah  But it was fun  We had a good time  Oh good  What do you have to plug Poe?  Well  I'm hoping that I can redeem myself  By having a body rock seminar  In New York City  Probably no one will come  But you know  At least I can  I can dance  You're  What?  A body rock seminar 
[01:44:30]  What is a body rock  Seminar  Body rock seminar  It's a dance seminar  Oh  E-Rock's raising his hand  Yes E-Rock  Body rock is his workout routine  That he thought the hip hop abs guy stole from him  I remember that  It does seem like he actually did that  And how did they steal that from you  Master Poe?  Well the moves that I looked at  I watched the DVD  And most of those moves  Or many of those moves  I have used  And I've been doing body rock for about 8 years  So I'm not saying he stole it from me 
[01:45:00]  I'm saying that  He was first  He was the smart guy  So  Are you doing a body rock seminar?  I was told you were doing one  Friday, November 2nd  And Saturday, November 3rd  At Sweet Basil Restaurant  In Queensbury, New York  Is that true?  Next Friday, Saturday  I heard you were doing a body rock seminar there  Yes  After my shows  How did you find that out?  Just a rumor  Okay  When did you pick seven hours?

Yes, sir  Wow  What do you do?  Just dance for an hour?  Sure  When I went to New Orleans  I was dancing on the street 
[01:47:30]  I like to dance  I'm sorry  I like to dance  I don't know  I remember you dancing on the street  I love martial arts  And I love to dance  People in New Orleans  Actually disliked that more than Katrina  Yeah, I know  You know what I like?  Master Poe off the radio  Okay  Oh  I hate you on the radio  Oh  My skin crawls  I don't know what it is  I love Master Poe  He sucks  On the radio  Poe  I think we just thought he 
[01:48:00]  Alright  Thank you guys  Alright  I think he was  There he goes  Owen A Body Rock  Coming soon  To the  The great facility  The Lincoln Jet Center  Hey, I love a dreamer though  I can't  I can't mock that  I've already made some contacts  The man at the door  Yeah  Yes  Alright, listen  You gotta get through the door  Before you can talk to somebody  They're gonna let him dance in the mall 
[01:48:30]  They probably told him  Like, yeah  Downstairs is a big facility  It's multi-leveled  You'll see a Bose store  And a little cafeteria area  And you can dance down there  Alright, listen  I want to ask Poe  Why would you plug something  You don't have a date for  You can't plug it yet  Because it's Master Poe  That's the whole bit  Jimmy  Since when do you know  How to plug things?  You're right  I might be learning  Friday and Saturday  November 2nd and 3rd  At the Sweet Basil Restaurant  In Queensbury 
[01:49:00]  Queensbury  Look at that  You got a place  A date  Let's take a break  We got a lot to do  Before we get out of here  On this side  We got a black woman  Getting junk mail  Addressed to  Well, we'll tell you  What it was addressed to  After the break  Oh, nice tease  It's very interesting  We also have  We found the Carl Lewis  Yeah, it's gone  Alright, we're gonna have  The Carl Lewis  National Anthem thing  That Tom says is terrific  We'll take his word on that  Tom terrific  The hot Carl  We're gonna try to find out 
[01:49:30]  If Tom's alive today  I have no idea if he is  We also have the Japanese Fart Party  I mean, it is Fart Friday  So this is perfect  So, quick break  And we'll do a lot of things  Next  It's Opie and Anthony  We're gonna be in Boston tonight  For the big Halloween party  So we wanna say hi to everyone  Listening on BCN  Go Sox go  Big Halloween bash  The sports curse ends here  My friends  They may sweep  I think they might  They play tonight  Or they're off  Besides just playing  Tonight  They're off tonight 
[01:50:00]  And then they ship on over  To Colorado  Now, do they do 3-2  Or 2-1-1-1  Remember the 2-1-1-1  I used to love 2-1-1-1-1  Whatever  Do the math  I think it's 2-2  2-3-2 sucks  2-3-2, right?  Yeah, because they wanna save money  On traveling, I think  Is that really it?  I think so  That's hysterical  One game or one series  That's just no way to play any series  To give, you know, two  And then three home games  To the  It's just  It's dumb 
[01:50:30]  I'm wondering if it's  Something to do with the weather  Or traveling  Or they're afraid  Of getting delayed  Travis knows the answer to that  Yeah, it goes  It goes 2-3-2  To give  Basically the Red Sox  Are supposed to have the advantage  They get the first two games  And the last two games  Ah, so that's  Yeah, but it used to be  A lot more exciting  Back in the day  It was, I believe  2-2  Then 1-1-1  It just kept going back and forth  So when you get up to the  5th, 6th, and 7th games  It was really exciting  It was like  Oh, now we gotta go over there  Oh, we lost over there  Now we come back home  I'm over here now  2-3-2 seems like a huge advantage 
[01:51:00]  For the city  That's got the three games  Because all you have to win  Is one out of the first two  And you're in a really  Really good spot  I don't know  All right, speaking of sports  We got Carl Lewis  Doing the National Anthem  Someone was saying  That that was Carl Weathers before  I don't know, though  It don't matter  It wasn't?  It wasn't  I'm gonna say it was  I don't care  It's Carl Weathers  It just  It was Apollo Creed 
[01:51:30]  That you heard last  No, that was actually  Dudley's father  From a very special episode  Of Different Strokes  And he was singing  At Mr. Carlson's  Pedophilia Trial  In WCKRP  Bathtub in the comic book store  Of course  I owe Master Poe an apology  Do you?  Yeah  What happened?  Trying to be a little more sensitive  He just frustrates the crap out of me  When he comes on the radio  I love him  He sounds so awkward  And then I sound like an ass  Well, I am an ass 
[01:52:00]  But I'll apologize to him  Yeah?  Just let the people know  I'll apologize  You throw him one?  No, I'm pretty honest  With him  Anyway, hey  Here's Carl Lewis  Now we got Carl Lewis  Okay  No, you won't 
[01:52:30]  No, you won't  Wait a minute  Oh, say can you see  And the Rockets red glare?  I think that's gotta be cut  No, it's not  That's why they're all like  Losing their minds  Wow  Wow  And then he realized  Uh-oh  I'll make up for it now  The bombs bursting in air  Gave proof through the night 
[01:53:00]  That our flag was still there  I'll make up for it now  Oh, say does that star-spangled banner get wave  O'er the land 
[01:53:30]  O'er the lands of the free  Oh  And the walls  Of the brave  Boo  That last line was all right  Oh, God 
[01:54:00]  That's edited  That was the  What happened?  That's the only version online  Okay  Was it edited?  Yes  He didn't put the  The reason he apologized  Oh, yeah  Oh, say can you see  I can sing  But it went to the  It just went to the last verse  Yeah  And then when he said  I'll make up for it  It wasn't because he said  The wrong verse  It was because he sang out of key  But we missed the entire song  Oh, my God  So we're still searching for it  I got to hear the whole version  I mean, just so y'all know that 
[01:54:30]  I could have sworn  He just, like, thought  That was the line  Yeah, that's what  I'm going to go with that  I guarantee you  If you could hear a cut  I could hear a cut  It sounds like it would be a cut  But  Why is everyone looking at me?  I don't know  Because you, like, find this stuff  Yeah, you found it  You're really good at finding this stuff  I didn't pull it  The guys in the back  All right, Danny will find  Another version of this  He's good in that way  We had four different versions  And they all had that part cut out  Ah  Yeah  And you think it's cut out?  Probably from the same message  The original recording, yeah, I think is  Okay  Tainted 
[01:55:00]  All right, so we got to get some more  Tainted? Ew  Let's go to Charlie in Jersey  Charlie  Morning, fellas  Hey  Charlie  Opie  The baseball playoffs  As long as I can remember  And I've been watching baseball  For close to 40 years  Five-game series went 2-2-1  Seven-game series always 2-3-2  Hockey and basketball do 2-2-1-1-1  Didn't they switch  That's what I'm thinking then, I guess  I thought they switched for baseball  At one point, though  That's what I thought, too  But I'm  Huh?  They talked about it at one point 
[01:55:30]  Doing it that way  But they never changed  Oh, they didn't  I thought they  I'm wrong, too  I hate the 2-3-2  I hate it  Well, not many people like the 2-3-2  I prefer the  Actually, I prefer the 6-1  6-1  Screw the other team  That's what I say  The funny part is  Sports talk stations will  Now talk about this  For a half hour  Yeah, they would do  They would pick this as a subject  And go, what do you think?  2-3-2  A huge subject  Or 2-2-1-1-1  Give us a call  Back at the Mad Dog Show  We'll be talking about  The numbers of the games 
[01:56:00]  What do you like?  The 2-3-2?  Do you like the 2-2-1-1-1?  You like a 6-1?  I like a 7-0  The team just wins  For the rest of America  Anthony is doing a fine impression  Of Mad Dog  Who does a sports radio talk show  Here in New York City  A lot of people all over the country  We're from New York  And they watch them on the Yes Network  A little less  Yes, Charlie  Great  Go Rockies  Seriously? 
[01:56:30]  Professing his love for the Rockies  I don't think so  I haven't heard one person say  Go Rockies  Unless the actual mountains  Fall on the Red Sox  I don't think there's much  Of a chance  Of the Rockies  Emerging victorious  Little thing about Mad Dog  I saw him on the streets  Of New York  Walking home  And he was  He was coming back  From getting his  Bruce Springsteen tickets  He loves Bruce  Bruce!  I love Bruce!  Bruce Juice  Bruce Juice  He loves his Bruce Juice  Bruce Springsteen  Blue Collar  He's a blue collar guy

[02:00:00]  Good point  That's  That's good, Tom  I think I just saw that on a  Pal Talk  People suggesting  Someone suggesting that he's  He should be a patient on house  He's just got  Such a horrid disease  Yeah  On the next house  A man that can't breathe  On rainy days  Catch the next house  Will house have to kill an infant  To save the man  I don't know, Willie  And he's got to avoid Mondays  That's his cure  Yes  Somehow house is going to  You know, figure it out  Where the guy avoids Mondays 
[02:00:30]  This man can't breathe  On Mondays  That's impossible  No, it isn't  I've seen it before  I'm house  House develops a time travel machine  So he can avoid Mondays  Watch house  Pop his pills  And save everybody  See, we got Tom laughing  That's good  He's not laughing  He's gasping for breath  Oh, are you laughing or gasping?

[02:02:00]  Had a whole field trip  Where we sent  Earl down there, right?  Oh, yeah  Yeah, this guy's been  Lingering for a while  We'll try to find that  And throw it on  The old radio, alright?  Definitely find that  Because I took  I took that whole week  Off of work  Just to sit home  And listen  You guys do that  That was hilarious  A waste of time  Yeah, we found a radio station  Their call letters  Were W-O-N-A  Yeah  And we sent one of our guys  Down there to see  What their station  Was all about  I think I remember that  And it was a road trip  And we had the whole  Road trip on the air 
[02:02:30]  And it was a whole big thing  That took about a week  And then the big payoff  And then the big payoff  Nothing happened  When they were there  Yeah  It was Wyona  Or something like that  Wynona  Wynona  Yeah  There you go  Yeah, maybe we'll check in  With those guys  It's been a while  All right, Ryan  Thank you, sir  Hey, Tom  Everything else all right?

Breathe in  Breathe out  Breathe in  Breathe out  Breathe in  Don't you know  I'm still standing  Oh  It's Tom  I'm still alive  On the Opie and Anthony show  All right 
[02:03:30]  We're running out of time  We've got a bunch of things we could do  We could play the Ass Whisperer  Yes  We could play Roland Singh  And the Star-Spangled Banner  We could  We have to do football picks  I know that, Dan  That one we have to do  And the black woman  With the junk mail  Want to try to do all this?  That's  Want to go into a speed round?  It's a hard story  Huh?  The junk mail one  Is a terrible, terrible  Yeah  Story  Yeah, yeah  All right, let's do that one  It is  I don't understand  How people can be so insensitive 
[02:04:00]  This is  What's going on  Well, it looks like  An innocent piece of junk mail  But a closer look  Has one woman believing  There's nothing innocent about it  She says it's a hate crime  And that's why she called  Harry Harrison  And the NBC10 investigators  Harry joins us now live  With the details  Harry, what can you tell us?  Well, Vince  A local woman says  She is outraged  Outraged by what's written  On this bill  She got in the mail  And now she wants police  To take action  Somebody wanted to be mean 
[02:04:30]  Somebody wanted to  You know, just let us know  That that's what they thought about us  Tracy Patterson  Who lives in Clifton Heights  Says  When she recently checked her mailbox  What she thought was annoying junk mail  Turned out to be something quite different  I'm not a stupid person  And I can read between the lines  You know, I can see right away  What the message was  Take a look  The bill was addressed to  Iman Iger  Patterson says  That's a play on the name 
[02:05:00]  To deliver a racially charged message  Wait for it  You know  Wait for it  He could have paused  Between the first and second name  A little more  I think everybody would have  Gotten the point  That  Wow  Oh my god  Hmm  Yes, black woman gets  Junk mail addressed to  That name  Oh, yes  Corey Glenn 
[02:05:30]  Acting postal inspector  In charge says  He's seen a lot of harassing mail  But this one  Raises more concern  This may not be the only incident  Or only situation  Or only type of harassment  That they may try  And we definitely don't want this  To escalate to anything  More vicious  Glenn says  His office will investigate  Racism  Or whatever  Acts of racism  Is not acceptable  And it's not going to be tolerated 
[02:06:00]  By innocent people  That's up there  With all of those  Like  Wacky names  I never heard of that  Patio furniture  You know  We get them here  We get like  Wacky names  Addressed  Haywood  Yeah, the one that's Haywood  Mike checks in  Every once in a while  Michael  Michael Hunt  Right  Is constantly checking in  But he uses a short version  Of his name  Phil checks in 
[02:06:30]  Phil  Phil McCracken  The faithful listener  Of the O.P. Anthony show  But I must say  I've never heard that one before  Oh, because it's a stretch  Here's the rest of the story  Patterson says  There are only a few  African-American families  Living in her area  It made me  Like sad  For whoever  Had to do it  You know  Because I'm looking at it  Like you know  Obviously  There's something missing  In their lives  You know  That they would have to  Attack someone  And try to  You know  Make someone feel bad 
[02:07:00]  And she also says  She hopes  The person responsible  Sees the story  And hears her message  They need to seek counseling  And they need to  You know  Love themselves  And if they would  Love themselves  Then maybe they could  You know  Appreciate and love  Everyone else  Despite their differences  There you go  There's the story  Wow  Yeah, but  Man, you wait for it  Wait for it  Wait for it  All right 
[02:07:30]  Hey, we gotta do  Some football picks here  But first  Why don't we do  The ass whisperer  We've been promising  The fine folks  The ass whisperer  Yeah  This one was  For Far Friday  Now basically  The set up  We're just doing our show  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah  And then Jimmy  Let's one go  Yeah  And then out of nowhere  As usual  And out of nowhere  You hear Anthony  Kind of stop what we're doing  And he goes  What?  Like someone was talking to him  In the room  From somewhere else  In the studio  I thought it was  He answered a fart  That's right  And we put this together  For some patients 
[02:08:00]  The ability to communicate  Is not an option  A lookover would be like  Some 80 year old woman  With her legs spread  But one man  Is about to change  Their lives  Forever  Did someone say something?  For the terminally ill  Who live in darkness  What the f*** is that?  Dr. Anthony Cumia  Who said that?  Has found a way  To bring light  To their remaining days  On earth  Using a rare gift  He never knew he had  Oh my god  What have I done?  He'll learn to love  Those he never knew existed 
[02:08:30]  I think I know  What you're going for  You're going for sexy  You're coming off as whiny  What a hot voice that is  And depends on their garments  I love it  Present a true story  You're an ass  Of one man's inability  To distinguish a voice  From a fart  You're talking out your ass  The Ass Whisperer  Coming soon  Oh stop it  To the Opie and Anthony show  I really wanted just  Him reacting 
[02:09:00]  Yeah the actual clip  Yeah the actual clip  I know it's in there  But that's alright  Huh?  No not the whole  Just the actual moment  Just the actual moment  Where he goes what?  Yeah  Who said that?  I think the line was  Who said that?  Yeah who said that?  And then there was  A whole discussion  Because you guys  Were looking at me  Like I had two heads  I was like he finally  Went insane  Yeah and then I was like  No I heard someone  Said something to me  And it was Jimmy's bottom  And then we rolled back  The tape and realized  He was answering Jimmy's  Yeah  Hey  Talking to me  We love to find folks 
[02:09:30]  At Dish Network  We really do  The football picks  Are sponsored by Dish Network  We gotta kinda do it fast today  Cause we had a real busy show  Time to get more TV  From your TV  Sign up for Dish Network today  They've been great  This football season  Dish Network  My brother with the football picks  He did real well last week  So you're going with it again  Yeah he went I think  Six for seven last week  He went six for seven  He did really well  We're a long way from winning this thing  But we're moving in the right direction  My brother's picking the Bills over the Jets 
[02:10:00]  Bills over the Jets  I think that's a good bet  I think that's a good bet too  At this point anything over the Jets  Big Jets fan  But you gotta go Bills in that game  Browns over the Rams  Cleveland Browns over the St. Louis Rams  My brother's picking the Eagles  The Philadelphia Eagles over the Minnesota Vikings  That's a good one  Tampa Bay Buccaneers over Jacksonville  Wow  The New Orleans Saints over San Francisco Fortinaner  Yeah  And he's going with the Steelers over the Bengals 
[02:10:30]  Wow really?  Steelers over Bengals  Bengals are having a pretty good year no?  Yeah but statistically on the road  They never will quite measure up  Unless of course  Was that their home?  No I know that  That's what I'm saying  I go literally like with the names of the team  I think like a big iron beam  Yeah  Could beat a Bengal tiger  But someone's got a swing  You could drop it on them  Yeah but someone's got a swing  That's cheating  Well that's where the team's like  A talent comes into play  You could take a big I-beam 
[02:11:00]  And swing it into a tiger  And what's a tiger going to do to an I-beam?  He can't even get his teeth into it  He can't stand on it  Alright using your logic  Using your ridiculous logic  Alright  You got the lions and the bears  Wow you gotta give it to the lions  Why?  Because a lion would kick a bear's ass  I think he's right about that  I think a lion 
[02:11:30]  An aggravated lion  Will definitely kick an aggravated bear  Alright we got a new angle  New angle  Next week you're doing the football pick  Literal football pick  Using your literal  Yep  Knowledge there  My brother did pick the lions over the bears  So there you go  Dish Network  Thank you so much  Sorry we had to rush through it today  But we appreciate you guys  Helping out the Opie and Anthony  Puppets on TV  We'll leave you with Rolling 
[02:12:00]  Six.  Banner.  Okay.  Jose, can you see by the stone early light for the ramparts we watch was so gallantly  gleaming, and the rocket's red glare, God's words bursting in air, gave proof to the light 
[02:12:30]  that our flag was still there.  Jose does that star-spangled banner yet wave for the land of the free.  And the home of the brave.  I got a tear. 
[02:13:00]  I just got a...  Oh, what a rendition.  It made me proud.  And something.  And Roland is not putting on an act.  That is our Roland.  That is Roland.  Avoid any gift.  We love Roland.  All right, Roland.  Thank you.  See you later.  Hey, you're going to be on Dance Friday soon.  Yep.  We want you on there.  Yeah, the next time they do Dance Friday, we want you, okay?  You're going to be the next victim for Jill TV. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  We didn't get to everything we wanted to, but that's okay.  Boston, we're coming to the party tonight.  Hoping to see some old faces, some new faces.  In Boston.  In Boston.  And the big Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe.  All right.  I guess that's it.  We'll see you guys on XM.  If not, have a great weekend.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:14:00]  Opie and Anthony.  And welcome to XM Satellite Radio.  All right.  Thanks for listening.  We're heading off to Boston, and we'll see you Monday.  Godspeed.  We do have to get out of here early.  Not quite this early, so don't piss yourselves quite yet.  I think we've got about an hour in us.  That's about it.  We've got a train to catch.  And then we've got to go on the choo-choo. 
[02:14:30]  But you know what?  E-Rock was telling me in between shows.  You might as well not even say it.  No, it's actually really good.  Oh, stop it.  Then who told you?  We quit.  This is where.  Oh, shit.  Swim, walk.  This is where his talent shines, though.  He knows the ONA Archive, and he just loaded a brand new Opie and Anthony bit that a lot  of the XMers haven't heard yet.  Wow.  Well, we fucked up Star Wars guy.  Which one is it?  Because we love messing with the Star Wars people. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, was that the guy?  Because we had a couple of Star Wars people.  Is it Star Wars guy or the people that were in the Star Wars?  In Stormtrooper outfits?  Yeah, it was the people waiting online at the Ziegfeld to see the first Star Wars movie.  Episode I?  Episode I.  Oh, okay.  Why is that good?  Because you were live on the air with them on the phone, and Earl got double parked.  Oh, okay, okay.  Don't give it a right.  Of course.  Yeah, that is actually really good.  Okay.  I thought it was when one man Star Wars dude came in. 
[02:15:30]  That was over here.  Yes.  We did do that already.  That was the first Ramon.  Was it really?  It was, yes.  Wow.  And then you had the history.  Do we have the audio of the guys that came in that were in the Star Wars costumes?  That's one of my favorite things we ever did.  I just found it.  I haven't cut it up yet.  So the X-Amers haven't heard that yet either?  No.  So that's to come.  Beautiful.  Guys thought they were so important because they were in the freaking costumes.  They were in their Stormtrooper uniforms.  Well, it was like...  Well, Chewbacca came in. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, those guys.  Yeah, the guy that came in.  Oh, see, we've had a...  That's why I got confused with the Star Wars thing.  Exactly.  Oh, the Star Wars guys that were in the suits in the movie.  Like the seven foot guy that was in the Chewbacca costume.  Yeah.  He didn't...  I don't even think he even did the noise.  No, he didn't.  He just walked around.  He just walked around.  Any dummy could do that, and he wasn't allowed to do it for the film.  And R2-D2 midget.  Yeah, the R2-D2 midget who was in the R2-D2 costume. 
[02:16:30]  And C-3PO guy.  Yeah.  Oh, the real guys?  Yeah.  He was in that.  Did he do the voice the same guy that did the costume?  I think C-3PO guy did the voice.  Oh, okay.  Anybody know?  Anybody know?  Hello?  What was his name?  Than Brian?  Someone...  Than, yes.  Daniels?  Something Daniels?  Oh, Chip Daniels.  No.  Do you know if the guy that was in the C-3PO suit actually supplied the voice?  Danny Daniels, his name was.  No, it was...  Lieutenant Daniels?  Anthony Daniels.  Lieutenant Daniels. 
[02:17:00]  Who is he from?  You are an ass.  Oh, God.  I'll find that out.  It's all right.  E-Rock's going to cut that up, too, for a future show.  Waiting for an instant message from Big Kev with all the answers, I'm sure.  Anthony Daniels.  Capricorn.  Oh, we get it, Kev.  Capricorn.  Yeah, thank you.  Kev right now is naked in front of his computer.  He's ultimately playing with his ball bag and looking at something that wouldn't interest  anyone but him.  Him and three other people.  Yes. 
[02:17:30]  Some weird site.  He would argue he has a nice fan base for his Big Kev Geek Stuff show, though.  Whatever it's called.  It never surprised me.  Oh, you know what?  I sat in on that program on that Saturday before Dr. Steve's program, yes, and it was  a lot of phone callers.  A lot of geeky stuff.  They had a lot of phone calls with a lot of geeky stuff.  There's an audience for that, obviously.  I consider myself pretty geeky, but it was so beyond me geeky.  You felt good about yourself.  I kind of started feeling a little good about myself. 
[02:18:00]  And your geekism.  Yeah.  Let me ask you a question about Big Kev.  Does Big Kev know computers pretty well?  He's not a geek in that way.  But I mean, if I have Mac questions, would he be able to help me?  Probably not.  Oh, no?  Yeah, probably not.  That tool.  I was just about to start praising Big Kev.  Thank you.  That S.O.B.  By the way, Poe, I will say it again.  I'm sorry.  I was an asshole.  Not a problem.  It's brave you to take water from Poe.  Don't take both of them, though.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Take one.  Thanks too much.  Oh, yeah.  Say I was in a bag right together. 
[02:18:30]  Wrong.  Your ears actually blow off.  Hey, why would you take water to Poe?  Poe just handed you after today's exchange.  Oh, my God.  Really?  I'm going to take it from fucking Kizzy at the end of Roots.  I'm an older gentleman.  I do references like that.  A classic's a classic, Jim.  Certainly a stirrup for that fucking glass-eyed cunt.  And by that, I mean Sandy Duncan.  Hey, we got to get to Sonny Ferelli. 
[02:19:00]  We're going on a train.  We're doing a big trip to Boston for BCN, their Halloween party.  I've lost the screen here.  And Sonny's on the line.  He's really frustrated.  In a way, I don't blame him.  Sonny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  You know, listen.  You know, I do get it.  You know, I do understand that this is not really an O&A event.  You know, it's a WBCN-sponsored event.  And, you know, and they're having you guys down there to promote them, you know.  But yet, when I try to get tickets, and believe me, I've tried all my angles. 
[02:19:30]  They literally just don't want any O&A fans.  It seems like they don't want anything to do with O&A fans.  Why?  Their little party.  I got to jump in.  I don't blame your frustration, Sonny.  It's really hard to get a ticket to this Halloween party tonight.  And we wanted to get a bunch of tickets set aside for the faithful listeners, the hardcore guys, you know.  And we couldn't get that done.  And something is going on with radio contests. 
[02:20:00]  This might be a little too inside, but something is going on.  I was trying to get two spots in the Hard Rock Cafe for a couple of Lindsay's friends,  because she's got some old friends in Boston she wants to say hi and hang out with tonight.  Yeah.  And they will not even give me two tickets for Lindsay's friends that are up in Boston.  And it's not that they're being dicks.  I swear to God.  It's not that Dave, the program director, and the staff at BCN are being dicks.  There's some bizarre thing with contest rules.  Same thing at K-Rock, where if you want tickets, dude, we would have to pay for tickets. 
[02:20:30]  We'd have to ask for them in advance.  Yeah.  There's a really weird thing.  It's got something to do with plug all of it, because fucking that's Elliot Spitzer's idea.  Elliot Spitzer has now fucked up radio as well, because every once in a while you go,  Hey, what was the concert I wanted recently?  I wanted a pair of tickets.  Yeah, there.  There you go.  Disgusting.  Don't make me talk about Philly.  What's that?  I asked him for four tickets, and the program, not the program director, but the promotions 
[02:21:00]  director turned out and said, Oh, yeah, sure.  Well, I'll send you four.  Just give me your mailing address.  So here I am, not even checking my emails after I gave him my mailing address.  Yeah.  And I spent over $300 to get a costume.  This Wednesday, this past Wednesday, I'm looking in the mail, nothing.  You know, so I checked my email, and he sent me an email last week saying, Oh, sorry, dude.  You know, I have to tend to all the corporate sponsors and everything else first, and things  are really tight, you know.  Well, it just seems like it's just going to be a hoity-toity bullshit party to me now.  You really want to go, though. 
[02:21:30]  I saw online that you're going to pay like $200 for a ticket, right?  You know, Sonny's like a good fan of the show.  Yes, a great fan of the show.  He's done a lot for the show.  He's in Boston.  You know, we should figure out a way where he can go.  We'll try, Sonny.  I don't know.  If you want to show up, I'll try.  What about a guest list?  I'm telling you, I can't get two for our guest list.  I know, I know.  And it was explained to me that they're giving away such big ticket items.  I think they're giving away a car and trips and stuff, and it has something to do, 
[02:22:00]  like Jimmy said, Plagol and Payola and all this.  Everyone that's in that venue has to be eligible for the prizes.  And I'll say, we'll put a big sign on Sonny's head.  It says, uh, not eligible.  Right.  Not eligible.  Not that you're a loser, but you can't win, so you'd be a loser.  This is a...  Yeah, that's too bad, because I was going to go as a nappy-headed ho.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Oh, Jesus.  Wait a minute.  I'm sure you'll be the only one.  I got the full Rutgers uniform and everything.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's kind of funny.  It kind of sucks we're not doing our own party this year, because then we could have 
[02:22:30]  done all this.  But the Flavor Flav thing really fucked us up for a year.  We had to take a year off.  It's going to be actually two years before we do another party.  Yeah, I'm not even kidding.  That whole fiasco last year fucked us up royally.  I'm going to send him a letter.  What's the name I'm supposed to address it to?  Here it is.  Come on.  No one could call back the funniest bit from our last segment.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Ah, yes.  I said I want to write Flavor Flav a letter about that, but what was the name I'm supposed  to address it? 
[02:23:00]  I'm a...  See, I had to say it twice.  I know.  A little skid.  All right, guys.  I got around it.  I steered into the skid.  Sorry, Sonny.  Bye, man.  All right.  I hope I do see you tonight.  All right.  Sonny, it really is a bigger issue than you.  I don't think they're trying to screw you on purpose, but there's a system and rules  in place that are just ridiculous.  It's the same at K-Rock in New York, though, dude.  Honestly, it's nothing personal.  It's got something to do with them being afraid of being accused of payola.  It's some bullshit like that, but it does have nothing to do with you.  I went to Tracy.  I'm like, hey, Tracy, I would love to see the Foo Fighters. 
[02:23:30]  Can I have a pair of tickets casually?  Because that's what you do on radio.  Like, hey, I want to go.  Can you put me a couple of tickets aside?  This has been happening for years.  Yeah.  And she got back to me.  I can't do that.  I'm like, oh, that's fine.  I wound up getting two tickets.  To Foo Fighters?  Yeah.  No.  It just slipped us some Coke.  It was so easy.  There you go.  That's what I got to do.  And she said, I really can't.  Every ticket has to be accounted for.  So if she gives me tickets, she has to explain why I got tickets.  And the reason why I would get tickets would fall under kind of a plugola thing. 
[02:24:00]  Isn't it something where you could get tickets, go see the Foo Fighters, and then be able  to come back and use it as knowledge for the show.  It's like researching your show.  That's what you would think.  Like, that seems completely legit.  Like, what happened with The Bronx Tale?  It's kind of the same thing.  You get tickets to go to the show.  Right.  So you can interview the guests. 
[02:24:30]  But they didn't come through K-Rock.  Yeah, that wasn't through the actual radio station.  That was through them chats, right?  Yeah, that was through them.  But that could be...  Oh.  Such a fine line.  Well, that shit could be considered plugola.  Plugola.  Do they not know the difference between getting tickets to go see an event because you're going  to interview somebody and you're going to talk about it, and a guy fucking playing records  for Coke.  Are they...  That's fucking L.A. Spitzer.  That's stupid.  Yeah.  And that out of touch with what talk radio is.  I'm going to plug all of his mouth with a big cock.  But he brought all this up recently and it scared the shit out of all the radio companies 
[02:25:00]  because they're taking it really seriously.  Well, they're fucking faggots.  Of course they take it.  They're cowards.  Somebody does want to use their real name, obviously.  Jane Doe from Jersey.  BCN has said on the air, whether it's true or not, that they can't give away tickets because  of the value of the prize is being given away, supposedly it's an invite-only event.  Yeah, there probably is some kind of dumb fucking rule now.  Isn't Elliot Spitzer the governor now, though?  Yeah.  Like, so who's the public advocate now?  I don't know. 
[02:25:30]  So fuck them.  I was going back and forth.  That's what I say.  I was going back and forth with David when I just need a couple tickets for, you know,  Lindsay's friends.  She wants to hang out with them.  And it was this whole big thing.  And I'm like, look, they won't be eligible for prizes.  We'll put a big X on them if we have to.  We'll put them behind ropes, you know, to make it perfectly clear that they're just  guests of us.  And I couldn't get it done.  That's why I'm not going up.  I understand what Sonny's all about.  They were kind of hemming and hawing on me going up or something like that. 
[02:26:00]  You're not going?  No.  Jimmy's got gigs tonight.  That's not why, honestly.  No, I know.  That wasn't the original reason.  Yeah.  I was fucking, felt slighted.  Although it probably wasn't unpersonal.  Jimmy.  It's just a financial issue.  So I don't know.  Can he be blaming Bob, say it was Bob's fault?  I don't know.  I'm going to miss Jimmy.  I'll miss you.  I like Jimmy on the field trips.  Field trips, I know.  You didn't fill out your permission slip in time, is what happened.  No, they just fucking didn't want me up there. 
[02:26:30]  Fuck them.  I don't think it, I don't think it wasn't, I don't think it was that, Jimmy.  Maybe not.  There was just some, some.  I think it was a clerical error.  Yeah.  I think so, too.  Steve came to me.  They just want the guys.  Okay.  You're, you're the guy, you're one of the guys.  I don't know.  Steve's a bear.  Fart Friday.  Oh, dude, you just shit yourself.  If, come on.  Come on. 
[02:27:00]  You just shit yourself.  Holy mother of fuck.  I was, it got to a point I decided to take a chance.  I spun the wheel.  The chance spun the wheel and you, and you lost.  No, I won.  It came up brown.  Boogie from Richmond now.  Boogie.  This is funny.  See, this is why we should have done our Halloween party.  Boogie said if, if we were doing our Halloween party, he would have dressed up like a huge 
[02:27:30]  pile of shit with a WISP sign on it.  Jesus.  Listen to this.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Oh, I love you.  I love you.  I'm gonna do it again.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:28:00]  I'm gonna do it again!  Ha ha ha!  I'm giggling!  Ah, it's so cool.  Is it coming out again?  It's so crazy  It's like a trumpet  It's so crazy  It's so crazy  It's so crazy 
[02:28:30]  It's like a trumpet  Ah, it's so crazy  What language is that?  Of course Japanese  Is it Japanese?  We love the sounds of the Japanese 
[02:29:00]  Oh  Are they just  What's this setting?  Nice tub  They're all doing a handstand 
[02:29:30]  There you go  We can't get enough of the Japanese audio  Of course  Today's Japanese audio is a  Japanese fart party  They hold fart parties?  Is this a video?  In Japan?  That we could check out?  Yeah, the video is up on Gorilla Mask  Gorilla Mask?  Yeah  Wow  With the founder music watermark?  I'm sure we'll have that  Yes, of course  My flaming cog 
[02:30:00]  Japanese  The machine is working so hard  Even the gears themselves burst into flames  Japanese  Japanese women dressed as schoolgirls  Of course  They fart in guy's face  And laugh about it  Do they hold their  Little fingertips up to their mouth  And go  When they laugh?  Is that how they chuckle  After they blow a big fucking gas bubble  Into a man's face?  Of course it is  Does the back of their little  Catholic schoolgirl uniforms 
[02:30:30]  Flutter up and down?  Oh  Another  Hold it  Oh  That had some authority behind it  Oh God  Don't smell your microphone  Um  You know someone brings up a good point  On  Impossible they have the wrong show  His name is Philly Fan  He writes  You guys work for a bunch of dummies  I'm just reading this one  Eric Logan  Sorry  If XM  If XM had any brains  They'd be campaigning big time down in Philly  I agree with Philly Fan 
[02:31:00]  I fucking said that to him  I called Elo  And said why don't we put a banner  A billboard up  In Philadelphia  Put one up  In possibly Detroit  Or Pittsburgh  We did nice listeners in Pittsburgh  Why not?  Yeah  There's enough there to pay for that billboard  Why not?  Definitely in Philly  It should be hey Philly  It's a no brainer  Opie and Anthony are still on the radio  And then a big XM logo  It's a no fucking brainer  No brainer  Every other radio station down there has  Or radio show has banners as you're heading into the city 
[02:31:30]  It would be a no brainer  Philly Fan  You're absolutely correct  If it's a no brainer  We're just the guys to do it  And then he writes  But no  Did he put the  They're a bunch of O's  Yeah  And then he goes  They're a bunch of idiots  They won't do it  And I would love to quote Elo  And say  Why would we?  Why would we?  Does he have any plans for Philly?  We had a  Go there and drink  We had a  We had a pretty big audience in Philly  And that would be a no brainer  Nothing? 
[02:32:00]  Is he drunk?  No I don't think he's drinking as much these days  No?  No I don't think he's drinking that much these days  Why?  He lost 20 pounds  He's doing Pilates  Is Elo doing Pilates?  Yeah  Oh  What a fag  He's doing girl exercises  Yeah  You can almost get away with  Is he in a spinning class?  You can almost get away with saying that you do yoga  Yeah  Almost  I'm saying almost 
[02:32:30]  It's still like yoga  But Pilates  Yeah  That's like a girls exercise  That's like doing jumping jacks  At the end of my session at the gym  The cool down period  Is Pilates?  No it's like a yoga thing  Yeah  And it works very well with stretching  And  Getting your heart rate back down  It's nice  Relaxing  Then you leave feeling all like 
[02:33:00]  So that I can understand  But  Pilates  Pilates yeah  The girls talk about doing Pilates  Jimmy's chick does Pilates right Jimmy?  She does yes  And that's why she has a nice figure  She hasn't done that in a while though  She's been very lazy  Girl doesn't have to do anything  It's really weird how she keeps her figure  I told her look  I try to be gentle  She's a girlish figure  But I'm like look  Could you keep doing Pilates  So I'm gonna stop fucking you  So you were gentle about it okay  Oh yeah yeah 
[02:33:30]  She was alright  And she goes by the way  If that fucking noodle  You call a cock  Disappoints me one more time  I'm bringing home a darker one  And we laughed and hugged  And smooched  Yeah we smooched  A little smooching  A little smooching  You're good at smooching  Yeah  Alright  You guys will sneak a smooch  A little smoocheroni  Yeah  Alright wanna get Ben in here  This book looks very fucking interesting man  He's a good writer man  I read Bringing Down the House  I loved Bringing Down the House  I started reading the follow up  I never finished the follow up 
[02:34:00]  Oh people don't like hearing that  I know  Sometimes it happens with a book  You pick it up you know  But I'm not saying it was a bad book  For whatever reason  I never finished the follow up  What was the follow up  There he is  Bringing Down the House  There was Ugly Americans  And Busting Vegas  Busting Vegas  Right  Busting Vegas yeah  I didn't finish that  Oh  No it was good though  I'm just being honest  It was alright  No you can be honest  But I'm also saying that  There's no reason why  Yeah  It wasn't like the book sucked  Or anything  No it was just you know why  Cause you read Bringing Down the House  And you thought that was 
[02:34:30]  I love Bringing Down the House  And now that's gonna be a movie  And all that  Yeah it comes out in March  And maybe I shouldn't have admitted  That I didn't read  Through the other one  No listen you read  I think it was because I was moving  Yeah  Seriously  And all of a sudden you just start  Putting things in a box  And you go wait a minute  That's right  I was in the middle of reading this book  I start books all the time  And it's amazing  I love to read  And I can't tell you  Sharon Osbourne's book  The last two Stephen King books  I used to never do that stuff  And I now start them  And I'm an older man  And then I'll get interested  In something else  And I'll start that 
[02:35:00]  And you don't finish it  I suck  Yeah  However this looks really good man  I'm reading the beginning  And I like the fact that  It's non-fiction  Oh thank you  It's called Rigged  It's the truth story  Of an Ivy League kid  Who changed the world  Of oil from Wall Street to Dubai  And it's like a world  People don't really see into  Oil  Yeah this is about like  How it's the biggest casino  In the world basically  And it's a bunch of young guys  From Brooklyn  It's mostly Jews and Italians  And they trade oil  And make millions of dollars  By 2 in the afternoon every day  And then go party all over  New York City 
[02:35:30]  And it's a bizarre scene  Because oil is so important  And everybody  You know politics and war  And all this  But the guys who are making fortunes off it  Are really a bunch of tough guys  From Brooklyn  Oil's gotta be going for  10, 20 dollars a barrel these days  Exactly  Perhaps more than that  Are they really guys from Brooklyn  Making cash off this?  Yeah and what's cool  They don't go to college  They apprentice their way in  To this trading floor  And it used to be  A potato trading exchange  And then it was a dairy trading exchange  And now it's where all oil is traded  And it's in Manhattan  At the bottom of Manhattan 
[02:36:00]  It's called the Merck Exchange  I didn't know anything about this  And then I found this place  And it's crazy  I mean it's like  A thousand guys in suits  But they're like tough guys  And they're weird striped suits  And they're physically fighting  For room on the exchange  Wow  To the point where fistfights break out  And there's one old guy  Who I interviewed  He was a little guy  And he kept getting  Knocked out of the pit  So he hired three clerks  Whose entire job it was  Just to hold him  Into the trading pit  And they get paid  Like you know  Six figures to hold this little man  Into a pit 
[02:36:30]  So he doesn't get knocked out  By the bigger guys  Wait they actually  But who  I never understood  I've watched  I'm reading the beginning  You reference  Trading places  Being the only knowledge  You had on the floor  And that to me  Is what  It's fucking madness  So look at that  And see them screaming  And waving papers  And the hand signals  It's insane  I mean the way I found this story  Is I got a call  After bringing down the house  Came out  And a guy who had gone  To Harvard Business School  To ring the bell  At the Merck Exchange 
[02:37:00]  And I didn't know anything about it  Except for that it was  In the movie Trading Places  Remember that scene  Yeah sure  So I go down there  And when I get there  I look out  And it's this scene of like  Guys you know  Italians and Jews  Kind of pushing each other  And shoving each other  One or two girls in there  Who have like high heels  And they look like strippers  Basically  And I ring the bell  And then it just goes  Explodes  And there's paper flying  From the ceiling  And you don't realize  But at two o'clock  In the afternoon  Some of these guys have made  They take the money  And then they just go out  And start partying  And so I started following 
[02:37:30]  These guys around  For about six months  And watching what was going on  And then I ended up in Dubai  So the story goes from there  To Dubai  What exactly happens  Like the bell rings  Now a pit is  And I'm a novice  Yeah yeah yeah  A pit  What are you doing  When you're there  Well I mean you're basically  Buying and selling  Barrels of oil  If you're oil trading  Or crude oil  There's all these different  Types of oil  But basically  Like if you see that  There's a big weather pattern  Like there's a hurricane  Coming to the gulf  You know that's going to affect  The price of oil  So you make a bet 
[02:38:00]  You know that the price of oil  Is going to maybe go up  Because you know  The supply is going to get cut off  Or something like that  And then that price changes  Like minute numbers  All day long  But you're buying and selling  It's like playing  It's like gambling  It's like playing the stock market  You're watching the numbers  Go up and down  And you're making bets  Here and here and here  How do you buy it?  How do you like  Well that's where the little papers come in  Like you might be a guy  Who's selling oil  So you might represent  Someone who has  Tons of barrels of oil  And I might be a guy  Who's representing  You know guys  Who are trying to buy oil  So we might be 
[02:38:30]  Standing next to each other  So I just you know  Point you know  Make a signal to you  And then that little piece of paper comes  And that little paper flies down  At the end of the day  People collect all those papers  And then they log them in  And that's the only record of the trades  It's really insane  How do you know  How do you know  Who I am?  Well I mean  Everybody on the trade  Kind of knows each other  Like they know who's got the  Who's got the oil  Who doesn't have the oil  So I mean it's like  Do they leave the papers on the floor?  And at the end of the day  Someone cleans them up  But it's really just like  Word of mouth kind of thing  And then the papers  Are your only record of it  It's really crazy 
[02:39:00]  It's crazy  I don't know  You're explaining it well  And I still  Well I gotta be honest  I'm a layman too  I mean I was following these guys around  And I was watching  And I still don't really understand  What the heck was going on  I mean these guys were insane  But that's  Essentially the price of oil  Comes out of this room  And you know  It's really crazy  Because you know  Everybody cares about oil  And wars are fought over oil  Yeah  People are dying over oil  And there's also this group of guys  Who are making a fortune  Off of how it's going up and down  Well I assumed  Somebody was making money  Off of that stuff  Yeah 
[02:39:30]  Yeah  I mean tell ya  But the story rigged  It's also about this young guy  At 26 he became vice president  Of this Merck exchange  And he ended up going to Dubai  And partnering with a young Muslim kid  To open the first capitalistic market  And oil exchange in the Arab world  And so that's the Dubai exchange  And you know it's  Dubai is insane  I don't know if you've been  To Dubai yet  Isn't it building faster  Than any place in the world?  I mean it's the next biggest  I've been there but I hear it's the biggest  You know they built the  Underwater hotel that you get to  By submarine  What? 
[02:40:00]  They have an indoor ski slope  And it's 140 degrees outside  And they have a massive indoor ski slope  Yeah  They've got like a hotel that rotates  They're building the largest building  In the world  Yeah giants  They have everything you can possibly imagine  Wait they have an underwater hotel?  Yeah yeah yeah  They have an underwater hotel you have to reach  By submarine  And they have like  What happened was the sheik who owns Dubai  Is like he knows  He has like a trillion dollars from oil  But he knows they're going to run out of oil  In the next 10 or 15 years  So he decided to take all of his oil money  And turn Dubai into the biggest amusement park  In the world essentially  And so he just said 
[02:40:30]  You know I want to build  Like have you heard of the Palm Island?  He decided there wasn't enough coastline in Dubai  So he built a man-made island  That tripled the coastline of Dubai  And it's shaped like a palm  And then I just found out that he went to Vancouver  And he liked the way Vancouver looked  So he's building Vancouver  In the middle of the desert  He's going to build  Crazy people with a lot of money  And basically that's what you do  You have all the money in the world  And you want people to come  You just throw it around  How amazing is that?  Yeah  United Arab Emirates is their airline right? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah yeah  That's one of the best airlines in the world  Yeah and they staff it with incredibly hot Australian women  I just found this out  And in the book there's a big party scene  But basically they wanted to create the most upscale airline in the world  And so they hired all these Australian models to work in the airline  And you get like if you're in first class  You're in a capsule that like encloses you  And like you have you know everything you can possibly imagine in there  And the airline is owned by the sheik who owns the country  He started the airline  And so it's basically it's this like if you were the richest man in the world 
[02:41:30]  And you decided you want everyone to come to your country  That's what he's been doing  Yeah  And Dubai has become like also like a major party place  But is it affordable  First of all because it's Muslim  Yeah  Or is it a...  How safe are you as an American woman?  It's Western friendly  Yes  It's like the only place in the Middle East  Yup  That's really our ally  Other than Israel  But it's a place where like there's the Muslim people who live there  And then there's the expats who live there  But the expats outnumber the Muslims nine to one  So nine to one it's people who aren't from there 
[02:42:00]  So they have all these Muslim rules  But they also have an entire like society that doesn't follow those rules  And so you'll walk down the street and you'll see women in burkas  And you know Arab sheiks  And then you'll also see like guys in Armani and women you know dressed up  And there's tons of like now prostitutes from Eastern Europe have all come in there  And it's like you go out to the clubs and they're the greatest clubs in the world  You'll see like hundreds of the most beautiful women you've ever seen  It's become like a party spot for Europe  It's gonna end badly by the way 
[02:42:30]  Well probably  I just I see something happening where  Some fanatic is gonna somehow get power in there  And just say  Go crazy  Leave  And it'll just be a bombed out ruin  Yeah  And this all started as a desert just like Vegas  No it was  I mean it was a desert a lot worse than Vegas  I mean it was like a desert where it's 140 degrees all the time  There was nothing  And there were Bedouins guys you know on camels running around  And basically the sheiks family they owned it you know 
[02:43:00]  Because that's how it works with the sheiks  And it was originally they traded pearls  It became a marketplace  And then they found oil  And then when they found oil  They were smart enough to realize that oil doesn't last forever  Right  And then they decided we're gonna try and get the whole world  And some feedback is going nuts  Everyone's saying how amazing Dubai is  And someone is suggesting  We gotta go to Google Earth and check out the Palm Islands  It's supposedly amazing  It's insane  You can see it from space  And they just built something called the World Island  Which it's a map of the world but in islands  And you can buy your own  I have a friend who's buying Scotland 
[02:43:30]  Because he's Scottish  You can buy your own country  And it's massive  The only thing is you're not allowed to build an airstrip  So you can only go by boat to each one  Damn  But they're huge  And from the space it looks like the map of the world  And it's in the middle of the ocean  Oh my god  And also Dubai like everyone's rich  And so there's Ferraris and Lamborghinis  And all this kind of stuff  And there's actually a cool thing on YouTube  Where there's this road  And they put in a speed bump  Because everyone was racing on it  And now in the middle of the night  Guys go out there with cameras  And watch the Lamborghinis go flying off the speed bump  But it's just become this huge  Like international party spot 
[02:44:00]  Well I gotta ask  This is  This is fucking a lot of information  Because my manager's gone there  He says it's an amazing place  My manager's an arms dealer  How much is it  There's first of all two questions  How expensive is it to go visit there?  I mean it's expensive  They have a hotel  Which is the only like  Seven star hotel in the world  Which is the one that has a huge sale  And it has that  That's where Tiger Woods was hitting golf balls  Okay yeah yeah  Off the top of that hotel  And I think Agassi was hitting tennis balls  Off the top of it  It's like 20,000 a night there  But there are other places  It's expensive 
[02:44:30]  For a regular room?  No that hotel is ridiculous  It's like two floor rooms and everything  I mean it's an expensive place  Just flying there is expensive  How much is there for a round trip  Would you say?  Oh I mean I don't  I don't even know what the average  Why am I asking that?  Coach I don't even know  Coach is there a meal?  There's such a thing as a coach  Do they serve snacks?  They probably serve snacks  You have to buy a snack box  A little snack  How about the underwater hotel?  What the fuck is that?  The underwater hotel  I haven't stayed there  But I saw a thing on  I watch it and it's like  You take a little submarine  And it lets you out a little airlock  And you're staying underwater  It's insane  But what if the fucking thing collapses? 
[02:45:00]  You're underwater  Yeah  It's safe  They gotta figure it out  Other windows?  Do you look out the window?  Yeah yeah yeah  The fishies go by  You can see everything  It's underwater  I don't know  That's gotta be ridiculous  I don't know how much it is  Do they have nice rooms?  I didn't stay there  I don't wanna go there  Is it nice?  How do you go out and shop?  You're under the water  You gotta take a submarine  You gotta take a submarine  They have the largest shopping mall  In the world there now  And they're building the second largest shopping mall  So they have both of them  How many hours flight?  Oh I think it's like 15  It's long 
[02:45:30]  Direct though right?  It's direct from New York  Yeah they opened up a big door  Yeah where else are you gonna land first?  Do Muslims hate that place?  Well you know what  I've heard that  If you have Israel on your passport  You might have trouble  But I haven't heard  I haven't  I mean that's the one place in the Middle East  That's okay  You know for  Muslims have a problem with Jews?  Well in general  But in Dubai they don't  Dubai is really the one place where it's multicultural  Yeah  It's the one spot where you look at it and you think that  You don't feel like you're in a scary area country  You would think the rest of the Middle East would follow suit 
[02:46:00]  And go wow look what they're doing in Dubai  That seems pretty cool  Why don't we do something?  Qatar is doing that now  Okay  And Abu Dhabi  The whole Emirates area is becoming like that  I mean it would be great to see Iran do that  But I mean it's slowly  No we're gonna bomb them soon  Listen if it succeeds and it doesn't get blown up  And everybody like goes there and it becomes a big party town  Yeah  I could totally see it becoming the norm  I mean you've got money  Why not spend it on making your place you know cool  Because there's too many fanatics over there that don't understand  They look at that and realize oh my god 
[02:46:30]  It's fun  It's entertaining  It's profitable  It's evil  You know we gotta beat our women  Beat the women  I'm so mad  It's like a billion people from the Westboro Baptist Church  Like if those fucking psychopathics ran  I mean that's what radical Muslims are like  Do radical Muslims  They have to want to fucking target this place  Yeah  How do radical Muslims not want to target a Muslim land  Being fucking laughed and fucked on by Westerners  How do they not want to bomb them  Well supposedly it is  It is on a high 
[02:47:00]  Like Al-Qaeda doesn't like them either  I mean they're really high on the list  Of course  But the sheik who runs the country  He doesn't even walk around with bodyguards  He walks around the town  Everyone knows him  It's really bizarre  He'll be driving in his car  And people  That's the sheik  The black ham  That's the emir  He owns the country  And it's  Yeah it's a strange place  I mean it's definitely  Maybe he's funding things on the side  Oh like bad people  Oh yeah  Or maybe he's sending money  He's a very forward looking guy  I mean he's very in love with the West  And he likes the Western culture  And he's a big fan of you know 
[02:47:30]  I mean to protect himself  Oh  I don't know what's going on underground  Like as a protection thing  Maybe he's shipping a little bit of money out  To keep it quiet  I don't know  It's a conspiracy theory  No no no  How else do you keep them from coming and targeting you  When you're a Muslim country  Where Westerners are going having fun  Have they got an army or anything?  I don't think they have  I don't know  I don't know what they are  They're all building shit  Right  I'm going to Karachi  Comedy Club in Karachi actually  Karachi  It's called The Declitorizer  Let's go to Jesse in Tennessee  Jesse  Hey O'Brien Anthony  How are y'all doing? 
[02:48:00]  Pretty good buddy  Hey  Now a little fun fact about Dubai  About 10% of the world's cranes  Are over there  Just because they're trying to build this thing so quick  And you know  It is extremely westernized  The sheiks over there love Americans  And they invite them over there  To work in the medical fields  And the crane operating  To build this place  It's just  You'll go to their website  It's extremely  It's just beautiful over there  How much do you think that  Underwater hotel is 
[02:48:30]  So I'm upset for this  Enough about the hotel  No I'm sorry  I get  My girlfriend and I want to go away  So I'm thinking maybe  Dubai  You should go to Dubai  How cool would that be?  I came back alone just with her head  Sorry baby  I don't know what happened  Something fell through  I'm sitting there with her torso  Like no one to talk to  Feeling silly  Drop it off on her family's doorstep  Hey  Well  She got mouthy  She said look  I'm a Jew  What are you gonna  You know  She showed her terrific abs over there 
[02:49:00]  And they didn't like that  Yeah  They were the devil's abs  Yeah  Jesse there's a website  Yeah there's a website for Dubai  If you look it up  I'm not sure exactly what is  You know what the website is  But me and my wife are invited to go over there  In about two or three years  And I'm gonna be doing the same thing  It sounds like they would have gotten Dubai.com  Yeah you'd hope so  Yeah yeah  They got the money  You can probably get it  You go to that website  You'll see some extreme pictures of what they're building over there  It's like the world's largest building and everything  They have a hotel in that building too 
[02:49:30]  With an indoor pool  I think it's the world's highest indoor pool or some shit  Yeah yeah yeah  They have all this weird stuff  I wanted to go take a dip  I'd love to fly and take a dip  I'd love to fly and take a dip  Ha Ha  And then turn around and go home  How cool  So how much time you spend in Dubai?  Ahh I mean just research time  Okay  Just like a week  It wasn't like months in Dubai  I mean I spend most of the time in New York  Cause that's where most of the story takes place  Yeah  We have been down on the floor at the stock market  You should go  I would love to 
[02:50:00]  It's insane.  I remember my one memory is a guy just sitting at a computer and trading.  I don't know if it was oil, but he was trading something on like the 16th of a point all day long.  Oh, yeah.  Playing the ticks.  Playing the ticks.  It went up a little bit.  He sold or whatever.  And then it went down.  He was buying all day long.  That's all he was doing, like sell, buy.  And he was telling us by the end of the day, he'll make, I forgot how much, but close to $100,000 or something ridiculous just by doing this.  Ridiculous.  And that's all he does all day. 
[02:50:30]  That's his job.  You think a lot of those guys are down there working for us, but they're also working for themselves.  Like, all right, I'm just here buying, selling, buying, selling.  High stress job.  All day long.  Well, it is high stress.  I mean, there's one guy in the book who he made a big bet and lost $400,000 and basically got in his car and drove and nobody ever saw him again.  Like that kind of thing happens too.  It's gambling, you know?  Yeah, totally.  So you lose your money the same way you lose your money in the stock market too.  Well, let me ask you what this thing with the oil exchange and stuff like that.  Oh, I fucking forgot what I was going to say.  Oh, no.  No, I had a real question. 
[02:51:00]  It was something about Jiffy Lube.  No.  Could you get me a free Jiffy Lube?  I'd make some calls.  Oh, fuck.  It was about the exchange.  I'll have to come back.  All right, think about it.  We'll go to John in Virginia.  Damn.  John, what's up?  Oh, does it cost a lot of money?  What?  I'm kidding.  Yeah.  John, go ahead.  Hey, one of those hotels in Dubai has seagulls that like to roost up on it, and they actually  have a team of trained falcons that will fly up there and snatch the seagulls out and kill 
[02:51:30]  them.  That's cool.  That's a fun thing to watch.  I just need to train them to attack Jews next.  Well, he means the seagulls.  He's starting with just one family at a time.  George was attacked.  They were remaking.  They were doing carbon copy part two with him and Denzel.  Supposedly, one of the websites is www.palmsales.ca. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, that's selling the islands.  All right.  Fred in Brooklyn, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Those crazy rich motherfuckers set up a tremendous indoor ski resort.  Yeah, Ben was talking about that.  It's the fucking desert, man.  It has multiple ramps.  It's the size of the ski lift.  It's the biggest indoor ski slope in the world, and it's 140 feet left side, and it's glass  walled, so people outside are like watching people ski in jackets and things like that.  It's just tons and tons of money.  140 degrees?  Yeah, 135 or so. 
[02:52:30]  Why are we doing this shit in America?  Because we don't got that kind of money.  We have mountains.  We spend our money on our knees.  I don't even know.  10,000 degrees everywhere.  Exactly.  I don't even.  I wasn't even thinking about that, but just in general, these over-the-top structures  and like underground, underwater hotels and stuff.  We got some weird shit.  We got like the Mall of America.  It's like a giant amusement park in there.  And you see what Japan's doing.  Japan's doing like indoor skiing, and they're getting weird with some of their buildings. 
[02:53:00]  I don't know.  I think it's out of necessity, too, because Japan's another place that really doesn't  have that much real estate.  So they, you know, in order to make their airport, they had to push a lot of Japan into  the water and build on.  Extend the land.  Yeah.  They had to make more of Japan.  Yeah.  I think it's places that aren't all that big have to come up with these unique ways  of getting a lot of people in there.  Hey, Ben, you're an interesting author.  I got to tell you, Bringing Down the House is going to be a movie.  That was a huge, huge book for you.  Yeah, it's a big book.  Which is Spacey? 
[02:53:30]  And who's going to be in it?  Kevin Spacey?  Kevin Spacey, Lawrence Fishburne.  A little actor named Kevin Spacey.  Oh, Fishburne.  A little Oscar winner named.  The bad guy, and then Kate Bosworth is the hot MIT girl.  Wow.  The hottest MIT girl.  Lawrence Fishburne, by the way, Cowboy Curtis from the Pee Wee Herman show.  That's right.  Yeah, that's right.  Wasn't he real?  Was that before Cornbread Earl and Me quickly?  Oh, I think it was.  How old was he?  That was pretty much the first.  He was like a kid.  He was like 19.  19?  Something ridiculous.  No, no.  He was younger in Apocalypse Now, and he was younger in Cornbread Earl and Me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And also, book, I didn't know about this one, Ugly Americans. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, I wrote it.  When did that come out?  Ugly Americans came out right after Bringing Down the House, but it was big in the financial  world and big overseas, but the title Ugly Americans kind of hurt it a little bit in the  U.S.  I think it's about a true story about a kid from New Jersey who ended up in Japan, and  he fell in love with the daughter of a Japanese gangster.  He met in a hostess club, and it takes place kind of in the sex underground Japan.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  He made $500 million in five minutes in a single trade.  He was a trader. 
[02:54:30]  Wow.  Wow.  And then he had to get out of Japan quickly.  Wait a minute.  $500 million?  Yeah.  He made a single deal.  He worked for a hedge fund that kind of had Yakuza, Japanese mafia ties.  And it's a crazy story.  I spent a month over in Tokyo.  How dangerous could they be?  These guys were so like, the expats in Japan are nuts.  Like, these guys, they are so rich, and they live like rock stars.  They all have like 15 girlfriends who know about each other but don't care.  If you're like a white guy in your 20s or 30s with money in Japan, you're like a god. 
[02:55:00]  I mean, basically.  Does the Yakuza fuck with those guys or no?  No, they don't normally.  Normally, the Yakuza doesn't fuck with white people.  Like, the Yakuza stays away from foreigners.  Why?  Because they just have this code where like, what's between Japanese is between.  You're always an outsider in Japan.  And they leave the outsiders to the outside world, basically.  And so, usually, you can get away with just about anything.  But the main character of that book did get involved more with like, bad dudes.  And so, he eventually had to get out of the country.  Don't they have, the Yakuza, I believe, don't they cut a piece of their pinky off to prevent infiltration? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, no, no, no.  If you do something bad, like if you make a mistake and you're a lower Yakuza guy,  you have to cut off your pinky and give it to your boss as a sign of loyalty and respect.  And so, you'll meet these old-timer guys who don't have pinkies.  And those guys are more respected because they did cut off their pinky.  I did an interview.  I had to interview this Yakuza crime boss.  And I flew out there, and they took me to Osaka.  And this translator said, okay, you're going to go in there, and the guy you're talking to is in front of you.  There's going to be a table of guys behind you, but you are not to turn around.  You cannot turn around. 
[02:56:00]  And so, I did an entire interview facing forward.  And these guys did not have pinkies.  And these guys are like covered in tattoos, and they like wear swords and stuff.  It's really nuts.  Why couldn't you turn around?  Because they were going to watch me.  And I was, the whole time, all you want to do is turn around.  I don't remember what I asked this guy at all.  This is the worst interview ever.  I mean, it was like five minutes just trying to get the fuck out of there.  Basically, these guys were just behind me the whole time.  It's crazy.  I mean, it's a very, you know, it's not like the Sopranos.  I mean, these guys are really like, you know, so intense.  They tattoo their whole bodies, and it's a really painful process. 
[02:56:30]  It's not like they do it here, they do it there with like these little, you know, they take like bamboo and a rock or something.  These guys are really intense.  I'm going to spell your name, too, because as I'm hearing this, like if you want to Google Ben, M-E-Z-R-I-C-H.  I guess that was fairly, just so you don't put M-E-S in.  M-E-Z-R-I-C-H.  Because that sounds like a really fucking cool book.  Oh, I'm sorry.  BenMessage.com.  Yeah, getting back to the Japanese thing, though.  You went to the underground sex clubs.  That's why I'm bringing up ugly Americans. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, there's places called sexual harassment clubs.  These are insane.  So you go in, and it looks like a subway car.  You go down these stairs.  And it's even like vibrating like a subway car.  And they have women standing there, you know, as if they're riding the subway.  And you pay a fee, and you can go in and molest them.  And then there's another one that looks like a hospital, and the girls are dressed as nurses.  And then there's places called Soap Lands.  Have you heard of Soap Lands?  And Soap Lands are multi-story buildings.  And on each floor, the women get better and better looking.  And on the top floor, it's actual actresses and porn stars.  And there's rubber mats in rooms, and the women use themselves as sponges. 
[02:57:30]  They soap themselves up, and then they roll on as sponges.  And that's what a Soap Land is.  Then they have places called Five Minute Clubs.  Five Minute Clubs, okay, it's all these booths in a row.  And you sit in the booth, and there's a little clock on the wall.  And a girl will come in and start giving you a blowjob.  And then the clock hits five minutes, and she gets up and moves in.  Another girl comes in.  And it just keeps going until you want to leave.  Like, there's these places, basically in Japan.  It's hard to think, though, who's in the room to the right of you when the other girl comes in. 
[02:58:00]  They use rubbers?  I mean, I assume.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, not a lot of kissing in the Five Minute Club.  No, no.  I mean, like, the sex world in Japan is so enormous, you can't even imagine it.  There's an area, and they say they have something like 500,000 visitors on a Friday night.  And it's this entire, like, 10-block area in Japan, which is all designated as a red light zone.  And you go through, and it's just building after building after building after building.  And everything, like the way the Japanese work, it's all very compartmentalized.  So if you want to, you know, get a blowjob, there's a place to get a blowjob. 
[02:58:30]  If you want to just feel a tit, there's a place to, I mean, it's a different thing for each thing.  It's like a supermarket, which is why the hostess clubs there, you go into a hostess club, and they're not about sex.  They're about flirtation.  But when Americans go there, they don't realize that if a Japanese guy wants to get sex, there's a place next door to do that.  And there's a place next door to that for whatever kinky thing.  There was one girl I interviewed whose job it was.  She would sit in a glass booth, dressed in a schoolgirl outfit, and read children's stories while men sat around her masturbating.  There was another place I went to called a No Pan Coffee Shop. 
[02:59:00]  These extra places are actually pretty famous there, where it's a coffee shop.  It's like a regular coffee shop, and it has a glass floor, and all the women are in skirts with no underwear, and guys go underneath and just look up.  And that's like, you know, entertainment.  I want to fucking, I want to travel.  My girlfriend should be shot.  I want to travel with you.  She should be shot.  She wants to go see her family for Thanksgiving.  Go fuck yourself.  You're going to the underground sex clubs in Japan.  Soap land.  Don't fuck me and Ben are taking a trip. 
[02:59:30]  Well, I mean, I just go as an observer.  They get very creative.  I'm just an observer.  I'm a married guy, so I'm an observer.  We've been talking about this a lot on our show.  The Japanese are very creative with their sex and their pornography.  Well, in Japan, like, sex is like a bodily function.  Sex is, you know, below the waist.  It doesn't matter.  When men go on business trips, women pack condoms along with them, so that just in case they want to entertain themselves, that they're doing it safely.  Come on.  No way.  The average Japanese couple that's going on?  The average married couple, that's what happens.  I mean, it's a known thing that when you go out after work, people are going to end up in these sex areas. 
[03:00:00]  I mean, that's what guys do before they go home.  And you go on the subways, and you'll see all the salary men, the guys in the suits, drunk, completely passed out all over the subway on the last train home.  There must be.  Because it's just, that's the way it works there.  But Americans aren't bothering there, right?  No, Americans can't get into these places.  And actually, you walk up, and there'll be signs that say, no gaijin or no whites.  Like, literally, it's incredible.  You can't get in any of these places.  What's that about?  The only way to get in is to have a Japanese guide who will talk your way in.  Because they just don't think, they're honest. 
[03:00:30]  I've interviewed a couple guys there and asked them about that, who own these places.  And they say, it's not because they're, you know, racist or they don't want, Americans, they don't feel like Americans can handle this.  Nah, they just don't want to look bad in front of our big American cocks.  Maybe that's what it is.  Could a Yakuza guy get you in?  Yeah, a Yakuza guy could get you in.  No problem.  Yakuza guys own the places.  I mean, it's all Yakuza owned.  The whole thing is all Yakuza owned.  So when you, which is like the Japanese equivalent of the fucking mafia, black market.  So you interview a Yakuza boss.  Yes.  Was he, was there one Yakuza boss? 
[03:01:00]  No, I mean, there's, I didn't get to the top guys.  I was at low level guys who like, you know, there's, there's all these different groups.  And then there's the young kids who ride around the motorcycle gangs, stuff like that.  And they'll work for a local boss who'll work for a bigger boss and a bigger boss.  And the bosses work all the way up to like the big, and there's big families, just like there's big families here.  A lot of people.  Yeah.  How did it come to this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's an intense world.  We're actually sold it to DreamWorks and Spacey's Attached as well.  And, uh, you know, there's a script and everything, but there's a whole strike coming up. 
[03:01:30]  So I don't know if it's going to get made before the strike or anything.  So if I want to join Yakuza, it's difficult.  It'll be hard, but there was a white guy who was a member of the Yakuza.  I remember reading about that and I don't know what, I don't know the story, but I remember  hearing a story about that, but I don't know.  I'm normally, it's impossible.  Fuji Nakamura will not get that Godzilla movie.  Let me tell you, my crowd McFriend, I'm Japanese Japanese.  So, um, so what did you say to this guy?  Besides, were you confrontational with him? 
[03:02:00]  No, I'm not confrontational with him at all.  Hey, motherfucker.  I mean, I'm a wusser.  Like, I'm not really like one of those war journalists or things.  I mean, I spend most of my time in Vegas and places like that.  So when I was interviewing this guy, I was completely, you know, I think you're fantastic.  What you're doing is great.  How do they treat you?  They treat me extremely well.  They're very polite.  Yes.  I mean, it's a different standard.  They treat Americans and foreigners, you know.  So, I mean, in some ways, I've heard some people say it's patronizing the way they treat  American foreigners, but really it's like, they're very deferential and they're very kind  and very, they just, you're just, you're like an alien. 
[03:02:30]  You didn't have to be afraid of anything because you've sat at blackjack tables in Vegas.  So you, you've been through any torture that they could possibly put you through.  It's not any worse than sitting there and watching what those fuckers can pull on you.  Yeah.  I mean, I spent a lot of time in Vegas chasing, trying to beat the house and watching people  beat the house.  I mean, I, you know, I go in, I don't go in confrontational because it would be really  bad, you know, you just go in and you ask a couple of questions, you get out and, and  usually they're over.  What do you want to ask them?  I mean, I actually just wanted to know about how their, their involvement in the business 
[03:03:00]  world, like, you know, these huge financial banks that go over there and, and during the  time period I wrote about in that book, um, you know, there were all these huge deals  going down and the Yakuza had fingers and just about, just about 90% of real estate  deals in Japan had, uh, had Yakuza.  They also said 90% of golf courts, golf courses worldwide have Yakuza money in them a little  bit.  That's what, that was a statistic I had read and that's the kind of stuff I was asking  about, but they were buying up lots of stuff.  I mean, it's, it's pretty weird.  And, uh, Ben's a great author. 
[03:03:30]  I mean, bring down the house and then you got Buston Vegas and, uh, the card counting  and, uh, and half that stuff in Buston Vegas, isn't it true where like, where you could see  the bottom card to the ACE, it's called cutting to the ACE, like a technique where, you know,  after the dealer rolls over the deck, they're covering the back card with their left hand.  And if you're sitting in the first base seat, you can see that card.  And if it happens to be an ACE, which happens like three times an hour, they offer the cut  card to you.  You know how they give you the cut card?  Yeah.  You, what you do is you cut from a hundred, exactly a hundred cards from the bottom of 
[03:04:00]  the deck, which I know sounds really hard, but if you went home and practiced three hours  a day for a week, anybody can do it.  And what you do is you cut to there and they move the front of the deck to the back.  And now the hundred and first card is an ACE and you know this for a fact.  So as you're playing, you just bet the minimum and count down.  How do you, I mean, you got to practice, practice, and you got to be like kind of mathematically  inclined and you're up in your odds.  It's not a guarantee.  I know it gives you a 55% chance on that hand.  So you got $10,000 on that hand and you're probably going to win five grand.  But the thing is. 
[03:04:30]  And you do that three, four times an hour.  And I think Vegas allows that to happen because they know a bunch of dummies are never going  to cut it right.  If they figure you out, you're doing it and they see you do it once or twice.  I mean, I got kicked out of the win.  I took the main character of Busting Vegas to the win because it had just opened and  we figured they didn't know him.  And he had been banned, literally banned from Vegas for many years.  And we were in there and he did two cuts, just two.  And we, I mean, we made a good amount of money there.  I mean, like 15 grand and, or 20 grand, I think it was in like five minutes.  And then the next thing I know, he's like, we've got to move.  And I'm like, why?  And I look back and there's four big dudes, you know, in suits coming towards us. 
[03:05:00]  And they walked us out of the casino.  I mean, they didn't put us in a back room or break your legs or anything.  They escort you out.  And what about the back rooms?  What do you know about that stuff?  Well, I mean, the back rooms, if you end up in a back room, it's like the one room in  the casino doesn't have a camera.  But they, they honestly, it's just a harassment thing.  They basically get, they're taught to get into your personal space.  Because if you hit them, then you've committed a crime.  Nothing in bringing down the house is illegal.  So you can't go to jail for it.  But what they do is the big guys try and get into your face.  And they tell you that, you know, they're going to arrest you, even though they can't 
[03:05:30]  arrest you.  They make you stand up against the wall and they photograph you.  And then they make you.  How can they even do that if you want to leave?  They can't.  And what your first thing you try and do is just run, just like yell and run.  Run.  Because if you, they can't kidnap you.  And so like on the MIT team, when they'd hand out the sheets that told you how to do it  across the top, it says, when in doubt, just run.  Because that's what you do to get out of there.  But they might, if they scare you enough, they, you know, three big guys get around you.  And the guys I write about are geeky MIT kids, you know, so three big dudes get in front  of them and are like, come with me. 
[03:06:00]  You usually go with them.  Now, are they going to beat the shit out of you?  No, they're not.  Although one guy, one guy did get handcuffed to a chair and slapped around at Caesar's  Palace for like 10 hours.  And there was a lawsuit about that.  10 hours?  Yeah, something like that.  And he sued and actually won.  And that was back in the 90s.  Why did they slap him around for 10 hours?  What was his crime?  Well, they handcuffed him to a chair.  He was a card counter.  And they didn't like him.  And they hate, they hate card counters.  I mean, they hate it.  When we shot the movie, 21, it was really funny because we were in the casinos and all  the MIT kids were consultants on the film.  So the actual guys were there.  And Kevin Spacey went gambling one night. 
[03:06:30]  And one of the MIT kids was just signaling him the whole time.  And the pit bosses were standing over and they knew exactly what's going on, but they  couldn't throw Kevin out.  So they're just standing there like looking so angry the whole time.  And Kevin won like 40 grand.  And it was great.  I mean, you know, they don't let you pass that picture over.  Let him take a look at that.  This is me in Atlantis.  The next day, hung over like a motherfucker, but with a handful of fucking loot.  You won serious cash there. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Are you playing blackjack?  Yep.  Are you just going on a run?  I've been on a run with blackjack recently.  You can tell them, man.  These are stories we said on the air.  Tell them how much you made.  How much did you make?  I took Mohegan for $150,000 and then took Atlantis for about $80,000.  With a gun.  He doesn't count.  That's good.  Yeah.  Do you count or you don't count?  No, I don't count.  It was, it's fucking luck.  Yeah.  And that's all it is.  And I realized it because the last time I went to the Borgata last weekend, I didn't 
[03:07:30]  do so good.  I worked it up to about, I worked $5,000 up to about $30,000.  And I was in the high stakes room and it was early in the morning.  I had been playing all fucking night and I should have just gotten up and left.  And when, you know, and then I saw that, you know, you always know, boom, it's changed.  Something's changed.  The stack's going down.  It's not on its way up.  It's not stabilized.  So, you know, play a couple of more hands and then leave if something doesn't change. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  When getting out is the most important rule.  The most important rule is just when their luck changes.  Just leave.  And I usually have Keith the cop with me and he's good for saying like, dude, I'm watching.  You're, you're going down.  You're losing now.  And then I'll go, okay, two more hands and I'll play two hands and then we'll just pick  up and leave.  Yeah.  You know what's weird?  I know it's all about luck, but when you play, you actually could feel the momentum  changing.  Yeah.  Well, you know, decks are streaky.  Decks are definitely streaky.  I mean, it's funny because it is mathematical.  Like you can have a mathematical advantage if you count cards and the casino always has a mathematical 
[03:08:30]  advantage if you don't.  Like they have a 2% advantage.  It's basically their advantage if you play perfect basic strategy, but there's definitely  streaks.  And even people who own casinos will tell you that they're, that there are, they believe  in luck to be honest.  A lot of casinos, even though they know the numbers are in their favor, they believe, you  know, there's high rollers who come in and go on these ridiculous streaks and nearly  bankrupt casinos.  That happens too.  So, uh, you know, it, it goes back and forth.  I just don't understand.  Here's what I just, just infuriating at times.  Uh, they're, they're dealing the cards sitting there. 
[03:09:00]  I get my face card on my first card.  It goes around, around and there's my fucking three, four, five, whatever it might be.  And there's the dealer's face card.  What's underneath the dealer's?  Right.  Another fucking face card.  And it happens so much more often than me getting a 20.  Right.  Up front.  Well, you know, it feels like that.  It definitely does.  The dealer's whole advantage is the fact that you have to go first.  Like that's their entire advantage in blackjack.  It really is.  Because, you know, whoever goes first.  Yeah, because if I knew they were going to bust, I wouldn't hit no matter what I had. 
[03:09:30]  Whoever goes first has a better chance of busting.  No matter what I had.  I mean, that's the bottom line.  That's why no one's supposed to hit when the dealer's showing a shitty card.  Right.  But I've also seen them.  No, even when they don't hit, I've seen dealers pull like fucking out of their asses  21s.  It happens.  It happens.  Oh, it's amazing.  You know what?  I mean, the numbers basically are always going to be a little bit in their favor, but what can  you do?  Well, how do you know?  Play the game.  How do you know?  This is driving me nuts.  How do you judge, even from having, look, a 100th card? 
[03:10:00]  How do you know just from like practice?  That's what.  I mean, if you just sat home and practiced and practiced and practiced, it's the exact  same spot every time.  And these guys would get a deck of six decks of the casino's cards before they played at  that casino and spend the night, the two nights before practicing with those specific  cards.  We're looking at 98, 99.  No, but that's what you do.  What you do in the book is you have the whole table with you and your team.  So you sit here and your friend sits here and your friend sits here.  So when the ace is supposed to come up, you bet $10,000. 
[03:10:30]  The guy next to you bets $8,000 in case you missed by a card.  And the guy next to him bets $6,000.  So you actually have three shots at the card.  Oh, okay.  So you don't have to be exactly perfect.  Okay.  And even if like one of you gets it, you're still going to make a percentage higher than  you normally would.  And it all adds up.  You know, you play three or four hours and you're starting to make real money.  And you're playing as a couple million dollars.  Yeah.  I mean, he made millions in this.  Which book?  Bringing Down the House?  Well, both of them.  Busting Vegas is a cutting one.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You ever play three-card poker?  I play a lot of Let It Ride.  Let It Ride. 
[03:11:00]  Let It Ride is a suckers game.  I know.  I know.  But you know what?  It's like if you just want to sit there and drink and not pay much attention, you can  play Let It Ride all night.  That is hilarious because everyone will tell you that that's a suckers game.  And you have so much knowledge of Vegas.  You can play forever and not worry about losing that much money.  I can't play big money blackjack anymore.  I mean, you know.  Is blackjack your best odds?  Blackjack is your best odds.  Absolutely.  Especially if you count cards.  It's your great odds.  Right, sure.  But I'll get booted if I bet big now on blackjack.  Three card, I noticed, I read something about this, you know, a little advantage for the 
[03:11:30]  player.  And I was like, that can't fucking, that can't happen.  I've heard that before too.  It worked.  I was sitting one night.  You got to find the right table, the wrong dealer.  You got to have the right position.  But if you're sitting in to the dealer's left, they take their three cards out of that  shoe and then they put the yellow card underneath it and place it down in front of them.  A lot of times before they put the yellow card, you can see their bottom card. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, that's all about it.  Now that's, you know, that's one third of their hand that you just saw.  That's huge.  So if you see an ace and you can't beat an ace, fold your fucking hand.  If you see a low card, your odds are better that if you have a better hand that they're  not going to be able to beat you.  But I played one night like that and did very well just sitting there and actually betting  more on the ante than the pair plus.  So pushes and stuff, I'd be paid off.  But I was like, holy shit, this is working.  Holy shit.  And I start looking around. 
[03:12:30]  I'm sweating all day.  Like the typical idiot.  They must know that I know.  Yeah.  Oh shit.  But at this point, don't you think the dealers are told you got to be careful with this crap?  Now, ever since Busting Vegas came out, they changed the way they're holding the back of  the card a little bit.  And they're actually much more careful about that.  But it's still possible.  It's still doable.  I've seen people do it a couple times.  But, you know, card counting still works.  I mean, they definitely are looking for card counting teams now.  And you don't last as long as a card counting team.  But if you do like the team method and bring it down the house, it still works.  And I know there's still an MIT team. 
[03:13:00]  There's still like three or four big teams that are playing.  And they can throw you out on what the innkeepers rule a lot like.  In Atlantic City, they can't actually throw you out for being a card counter.  Because there was a court case about that.  So what they do is if they think you're a card counter, they just shuffle up every hand.  And it becomes really annoying.  But in Vegas, they can throw you out just because they don't like you.  I think there's something called the innkeepers where they have the right to ask you to leave  their establishment without reason.  Right.  That's the thing in Vegas.  That's what it's called.  Yeah.  I mean, you know.  Thou leavest my inn. 
[03:13:30]  Like that.  Yeah.  But it's crazy because, you know, they should have let you.  If you can use your brain to win, you should be allowed to win.  Well, they're fucking repugnant, the casinos.  Yeah.  They do everything, including no clocks on the wall.  Right.  To rape you of your kid's college tuition.  And you can count a few cards and all of a sudden they're all huffy.  Yeah.  Well, you obviously had to hear about that guy at the Indian casino with the slot machine.  Oh, yeah.  That came up and said that he won about $1.6 million on the slot machine.  Had proof and everything, by the way.  Yeah. 
[03:14:00]  He took a picture.  But they said there was a glitch that the payoff was only supposed to be $2,500.  They offered him the max of $2,500.  Yeah.  But initially they took him into the back and he said they got very intimidating with  him.  Yeah.  Pointed at him and said, we're not paying you.  Yeah.  We just want you to know right now you are not being paid.  And here's why.  The machine's broken.  They brought in some guy.  They cordoned off the machine.  Some guy went in there with some tools to do some tests and realized the machine was  broken. 
[03:14:30]  You know, they didn't pay the guy off.  So he photographed the machine though?  He photographed it saying the price.  Yeah.  He had a cell phone picture of him with you won $1.6 million.  And then he's trying to sue.  But because they're Indian reservations, they work on different laws.  So he had to go up against the tribal elders.  The elders.  A tribal elders.  The elders.  They smoked a fucking peace pipe and told me to go fuck themselves.  Right.  So you come in a murder on the fucking. 
[03:15:00]  It's different rules.  You end up in a tribal jail.  There's weird tribal rules.  Tribal rules.  Well, the card counting team used to be nervous about playing in like Foxwoods.  Oh, I bet.  Foxwoods they did play at and they all ended up getting banned from both Mohegan and Foxwoods.  But you got a little more nervous there because you weren't quite sure what would happen  to you if they took you into the back room.  Well, they're still bound by state laws.  They are, but they have their own set of laws and judges and things like that as well.  So it's pretty strange.  When does Bringing Down the House come out?  The movie, it's called, well, we had to call it 21.  21.  Because of the Queen Latifah movie.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:15:30]  You know what?  Fucking shit.  It was really funny.  When my book came out.  Oh, fuck.  With Steve Martin and all that.  People would call me and say, hey, I saw a billboard for your book.  Oh, shit.  And what does Queen Latifah play in your book?  And I was like, it doesn't even make sense what you're saying.  Oh, she fucked up your world, man.  It did.  Because a lot of people know, you know, if you read books, Bringing Down the House is a music.  It's a huge title.  Yeah.  But it might help you because people hear that name and they know from the movie they'll  automatically look at your book because they wouldn't have before.  Oh, yeah.  That's that movie.  I definitely sold some books for that.  Probably helped them sell some books. 
[03:16:00]  Although I had a weird conversation at Spike TV once where I got a call and then the head  of Spike supposedly was a big fan of mine and they wanted to talk about doing a show.  And it was like me and agents and producers and we all get on the show and this woman  gets on and goes, Ben, I just want to say how much I love Queen Latifah in your movie.  And then, of course, the whole conversation goes, I hate that.  Yeah, it goes, I have to fucking love that.  You should hope you played it up.  I did.  I was like, oh, thank you.  Yeah, she was great to work with.  She was an awesome actress.  So how are they going to get everyone?  We're going to call it 21.  But how are people going to understand?  We're putting out a mass market paperback with the title 21. 
[03:16:30]  So we're going to re-release and I'm going to do a whole tour for it.  Not 21 grams, though.  Don't confuse it with that.  No, just 21.  Yeah, not 21 grams.  Yeah, no kidding.  21 and it comes out in March.  I can't wait because I love bringing Down the House.  And I did read all of Bustin' Vegas.  Oh, thank you.  I was confused.  I was on vacation, so it was maybe too many of those fruity drinks between chapters.  I appreciate it, man.  Thank you.  No, I did read the whole book and I did enjoy it.  I don't know what I was saying when you first came in here.  I realized when you said the cart, the cutting of the deck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was like, of course I read the whole thing. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's been crazy, man.  And Rigged, I think people are going to like Rigged if they like the other ones.  Yeah, let's get back to that.  So Rigged is the new one.  And, you know, it's been about 40 minutes and why don't we refresh everyone's memory.  This is the new Ben, how did you say his last name?  Mesrick.  Ben Mesrick, of course, author of Bringing Down the House.  It's called Rigged, the true story of an Ivy League kid who changed the world of oil from  Wall Street to Dubai.  His name is John D'Agostino.  D'Agostino?  That's his real name.  And we use a character named David Russo in the book, but his real name is John.  Once he agreed to allow his name to be used in the forward. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, well, when I first started, he was pretty reluctant to do the book.  And so when I convinced him to do the book, he was like, use a fake name.  And so I wrote the book, and then when we were talking about it afterwards, you know,  we convinced him, or I convinced him, that putting his name in there, you know, wouldn't  hurt him.  And he didn't want to, like, come out and say, I did this, I did this.  But then eventually, he let me put his name in the forward.  So he's been doing a few interviews for it, and he's willing to talk about it, which is  cool.  Will he come on the show?  I wouldn't mind talking to the guy who actually did it.  Yeah, I think John would come on the show.  Yeah, that'd be cool.  He's not dead, at least we know. 
[03:18:00]  No, he's not dead.  He's got some crazy good stories.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you hear about the guy that made a machine to make coins to bring to casinos and cash  them in?  Yeah, I heard about that, yeah.  It took him forever.  He spent, like, every penny he had to make, to buy these etching, metal etching machines  and find out he went, got coins, sent them to smelters to melt them down and find out the  exact composition of what they were making, got the medals, made these coins, and what 
[03:18:30]  he would do is go to the casinos, play a little bit.  He'd go in with, like, a bucket and play a little bit and then go cash them in.  And what they do is weigh them.  They don't count them out.  They just weigh them and give you the money.  That's awesome.  And he was doing great.  He was going all over the place.  But he got greedy and went to the same casinos a few times.  And what they noticed was, wait a minute, we're not losing these coins.  He's like, you know, he goes, actually, we're getting more coins. 
[03:19:00]  When they finally go through an accounting, they realized we have more coins than we should  have.  So they started looking.  Do they look like the actual...  Dude, they say to this day, some of his coins are still in circulation because they  absolutely could not tell the difference.  How'd they catch him?  He made a perfect...  They caught him on...  They started looking for people doing the pattern of coming in, like, they had the garages  and this guy's coming in with, like, a bucket.  And then they'd look at people that had buckets, didn't play for long, then went and cashed 
[03:19:30]  out.  And then they were investigating them, you know, because now it's criminal.  So they went to his house.  He's probably in jail for 10 years now, too.  Yeah, yeah.  But they said he did the most unbelievable job of forgery on these coins.  I love these schemes.  I spoke at MIT last week.  I love them, too.  My kids came up to me and said they've been beating the mass state lottery scratch tickets  because they figured out mathematically that there was a point in one of the scratch tickets  where...  I'm now ruining their scheme, actually.  There was a point where, like, there was a point when it became advantageous to buy 
[03:20:00]  a certain amount.  And they had put a pool of money together and they made 1.3 million over the last year.  Wait, wait.  Slow down.  Wow.  One of the scratch tickets, the amount of money you win rises each time nobody wins.  Right.  So there comes a point when buying a certain number of tickets actually gives you advantageous  odds over that one ticket.  Depending on what had been sold previously.  Right.  So they put out a pool...  And they tell you how many, you know, are bought, essentially, and then how much money  it's worth.  So they would wait and wait and wait. 
[03:20:30]  And then they'd pool up, you know, whatever their bankroll was, like half a million, I think  they told me.  And then they would go out and they'd buy half a million tickets and they'd win a certain  amount.  It's one of those ones that you can win a little bit here and a little bit there.  And they'd come out ahead each time they did this.  So their $400,000 grew into 1.7, I think.  So they made 1.3.  That rocks.  And the guy came up to me at this...  And he's like, I'm doing this.  Do you want to write about it?  And I was like, I don't want to write.  I want to invest in it.  It's a great idea.  I know.  Imagine that for a...  With a nickel scratch, you have 100,000 tickets.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  They had a team of guys working and scratching and everything. 
[03:21:00]  It's great.  I love it.  Sitting in dust.  All you hear is dead silence and...  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Some guy sitting in a pile of dust.  Yeah.  Hey, what was the $16?  What was the best Vegas scheme you heard about?  I mean...  Maybe not worth writing about, of course, like the MIT guys and all that.  There was the chip cup.  It was the simplest thing in the world.  And it was basically this guy.  And he had a friend who was a dealer.  It's always...  Those are always the ones that work best.  The inside.  But he made a fake plastic stack of $5 chips that was hollow. 
[03:21:30]  And so he would bet what looked like $20, but it was four red chips, and he'd lose.  And then the dealer would shove four black chips into the chip cup under the table.  Oh, wow.  And then when he'd win $20, he would pass it, and the guy would slip the $400.  And they made millions doing this.  Wow!  All day long.  All day long.  They'd just go, $20 win, $20 lose.  And it was the kind of thing where the casinos couldn't figure out what was going on.  It was really well done.  Wait, how did the dealer get the chips in? 
[03:22:00]  I mean, the guys were fast, but they'd just shove it right into the thing.  Everything they do is practiced.  Yeah, it's just practiced.  It was a great...  It was the simplest thing, because it used like nothing.  It was a chip tower that was hollow.  It was a tower of four $5 chips.  You know, it was like $20.  Sure.  But it was actually hollow.  Hollow.  And then you would lose your $20, and the dealer would just shove four black chips into  that thing.  Which is $100 each.  Yeah, which...  Yeah, and then...  Now that tipped over, how about a goose you'd feel like?  Oh, see.  But I love that, because...  But wait, but how would that pile go back and forth without anyone else noticing?  Because you lose 20... 
[03:22:30]  You know, you lose your bet.  Yeah.  20 bucks goes over there, and then the dealer would take it, and he would put it...  He would hold it like, you know, on his...  You know, he can stack it in his rack of fives.  Yeah.  And then the next time you won, you would just take that same stack of fives and...  Yeah, he's in on it.  The dealer had to be good with his hands and stuff like that.  I mean, I've heard about, like, the most complicated ones.  The Geiger counter one was a famous one, where a guy went in and actually had a radioactive  isotope, and he marked the aces with a radio tap isotope, and he had a little Geiger counter  attached to his knee that would vibrate the tiniest amount whenever an ace went by, and 
[03:23:00]  so he would know where the aces were.  But that's so much more complex than something like a little plastic cup.  Yeah, yeah.  But he got caught.  Yeah.  All these people got caught, and they ended up in 10 years in jail.  How does a guy like that get caught?  Because when he fucking went off, people were having heart attacks?  The garage doors all open?  I don't know.  I mean, the famous roulette one was the guys who had the shoe computers, and they were  the ones who originally made it now illegal to carry a computer into a casino, but they  would actually use...  They were physicists from, I think they were Caltech or something, and they realized that 
[03:23:30]  the way the ball goes around the roulette wheel is just the way a satellite orbits the  earth, and they figured out that you could figure out how the satellite degrades and slows  down, and it was the exact same thing.  So they wrote a program, and they would use their...  When the ball passed a certain point of the wheel, they'd press once, and then when the  ball passed another point, they'd press twice, and from that, you could figure out where  the ball was going to end up, and not exactly, but the general area.  But if you play those spots, too.  Yeah, and that was a famous one, and there were three professors, and they would go out  there and do this, and that was before computers were...  Now, of course, if you walk in...  And they won? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, they won a lot, but if you weren't to do that now...  How do you get caught?  They were tapping.  They thought it was Larry Craig.  Well, I mean, the honest truth is, the way you get caught in a casino is by winning a lot,  because if you win a lot, and you keep coming back, the casino's like, there's something  going on, because you can't win forever, and if you do win forever, they hire a private  eye.  The way the MIT team bringing down the house got caught is a private eye followed the  big player back to Boston, the guy who was winning a lot, and they found out he went  to MIT, so they went to MIT and posed as an MIT administrator, and got a hold of 10 years 
[03:24:30]  of yearbooks, and then they ran all the photos through their computer software.  So if you had gone to MIT and walked into a casino, your picture came up, and basically  they put the team together by figuring out who from MIT was going to Vegas.  And so they literally, like when you won big, if you were to win big, well, I mean, if they  didn't know who you were already, but if you run big like three or four times, there's a  private eye who's assigned to you, and he's just checking you out.  Let me slow you down a little bit, because a lot of people know that Anthony goes to the 
[03:25:00]  casinos a lot, and he was on a winning streak.  That has kind of turned around a little bit lately, but when does it get to a point where  they start watching you?  Yeah, like, all right, I mean, I'm sure they listen to the show so they know who you are,  so they probably wouldn't be watching you right away.  Well, let's say Anthony is just, you know, an average guy.  If you were an average guy and you were winning.  Because we've been to the casinos, there's thousands of people coming and going, so how?  No, first of all, there's thousands of people coming and going, but there's not a lot  of people winning like tens of thousands.  So let's say Anthony wins $30,000 in Atlantic City.  If he wins one time $30,000, they'll comp you a room, they say you're great, they'll watch you.  Do they know every guy that's winning $30,000 every night?  Absolutely, there's a guy, there's a pit boss and a casino supervisor who's got cameras 
[03:25:30]  upstairs and they're like, oh, there's a guy on table seven.  And they know your name after a while.  Let's take a look, you take a look, okay, who's that guy?  They make a call downstairs to your host, if you have a host, if you don't have a host,  someone's going to come up to you and say, oh, do you want a card?  They address you by name at that point, too.  They start calling you by name and everything.  Oh, I've been playing at a casino that I've never been to before, and I've been up and have  a guy come over and say, hey, how about those Red Sox?  Because they're not living in Boston.  And start asking me questions about Boston.  And I'm like, okay, he already knows that I'm from Boston.  And when it's $30,000, they look at the video and they're like, who's this guy? 
[03:26:00]  They'll run your picture then against what's called the Facebook.  And so the Facebook is all the unwanted people in Vegas.  The funny thing about the Facebook is it's anybody who's won in a casino.  After 9-11, they added all the terrorists.  But the MIT kids are still the first three.  And then there's Osama bin Laden.  So you can see what they consider more of a threat.  Bin Laden can't play in a casino?  Right, he can't.  He can't walk into a casino.  There's a six-foot guy with a head thing on it.  They'll look at you.  He's got chicks around him.  He's winning.  Right, so they'll run your face against the Facebook. 
[03:26:30]  And you're not in the Facebook already, probably, because you're not a card counter.  And then they'll watch you.  And then they might actually hire.  They have card counters who work in their security booths who will watch your play and  count along with you and decide whether you're counting or not.  And if he thinks you're a counter but a bad counter, they're going to let you play and  actually comp you stuff because bad counters are even better for them because they make  more mistakes and actually end up spending more money.  They spend more and they do.  They end up losing.  Because you think you're all, the count's great and you throw money in and the count's  not great.  Oh, they must laugh their asses off.  Look at this guy.  Look at this guy. 
[03:27:00]  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  They have a card counter counting with you.  And if he decides you're not a card counter, they'll just say, keep playing.  But if you keep on winning, I would say if you won like $50,000 like three times in  a row, that's probably when they start really looking at you.  But they know people go on streaks.  So overall, they don't start to investigate you until they feel like something's a little bit off.  Let me ask a question too.  It was about the guy Anthony raised, the chip guy.  Didn't they catch him?  Because you said he got greedy.  Was he the guy that they caught on video?  They found taking, because he brought them in his trunk and they caught him on video 
[03:27:30]  taking them out of his trunk.  He had boxes of them in his trunk.  Like that greedy idiot.  And he would go to Atlantic City and just do the, he would go everywhere.  Vegas, Atlantic City, like anywhere there was a casino.  You know, he would, he would be Reno and he would take a box out and then go to down  the strip in Atlantic City and just hit every casino.  Someone on Instant Feedback said he got caught because the guy that was making the chips for  him, like finally right.  He's another guy, the guy that was supplying the metal. 
[03:28:00]  Well, he testified against him after he got caught.  I interviewed a couple people who had a scheme, a roulette scheme.  And basically it was two of them working together.  And one of them would sit right next to where the guy who spins the croupier was spinning.  And the other guy would sit towards the end and just as the ball dropped, this guy would  distract, would, would spill his drink or scream or make a noise.  And that other guy would pass, would quickly just shove money on the winning thing.  And then they would win one thing and then they would get out of there.  And you couldn't go back to that casino for a couple of days because they would look at  the tape, obviously. 
[03:28:30]  But these guys had won some serious money doing this.  They'd go from casino to casino and just do one move each time.  How the hell do you do this?  Wouldn't the rest of the table react in such a way?  The rest of the table loved you.  See, the rest of the table, it was, it was, the rest of the table loved you.  Well, they can't help themselves.  No, they do.  No, but even if they love you, they're going to be, they're going to give you away because  they're going to be like, but usually like if you're in a crowded casino, like the Blasio  or something like that, and you win, you know, $3,000, they're just going to pay you.  I mean, they're not going to look at it.  It's, it's crazy night.  No one's going to stop you for $3,000.  What you're saying too is this, is because it's happening one time and out, if you, if they 
[03:29:00]  see you sneak in and win something real quick and the casino gets fucked, no one's  going to, in front of everybody go, he just cheated.  Hey, if you, if you do it five or six hands in a row, they might go tell somebody.  Right, right.  So if you get out immediately, they'd get out and they'd go down the street to the next  dude, hit one table.  But you're winning a couple thousand dollars each time you did this, if you did it with  a hundred dollar chip on a 35 to one, 36 to one payout.  So they were doing this like here, here, here, and then they'd, you know, come home with  $10,000.  You know, it'd be, you know, it'd be really funny if somebody had balls enough when it  won to go, Hey, I won. 
[03:29:30]  And then when the guy causes Stinko, I put the money, play the tape, play the tape.  And then he'd go, all right, it was yours.  That'd be great.  Steal from his, yeah.  Steal from his little pot there.  But it's crazy.  There's always going to be people doing schemes.  The only problem is if you get caught like a cheating scheme, you really can get 10 years  in jail.  So if, you know, card counting is much safer in that you're not going to go to jail for it.  You see the Keno, uh, the guy that won a Keno, this guy was a genius.  And, uh, he figured out that even during a random draw of Keno, there is a pattern. 
[03:30:00]  There's a pattern to everything.  And he, he, he hooked up a friend with, um, uh, ear, ear, earpiece, uh, radio.  He was up in one of the rooms at the hotel looking at the Keno game that was going on  because it was broadcast in your rooms.  You can play from your room or downstairs.  So he's talking to him and telling him what numbers to play based on, he had a couple of  a computer upstairs and was running through the numbers and all day, just numbers, numbers,  numbers.  And finally he said, okay, I got it. 
[03:30:30]  Here are the numbers.  He played them and that damn thing hit.  But he, the guy screwed up because his, the guy that he, his friend that he had downstairs  didn't have his proper ID.  So he couldn't get, so he couldn't get the money.  Then they started like asking questions and nothing was some, some things were, you're  screwing up.  What an idiot could have walked away with it.  Hey, the, the fans want us, want me to ask you about Anthony.  Uh, they, they want to send him a private jet to go to back to a casino.  What's that about? 
[03:31:00]  Oh, uh.  How do you get a private jet, you're asking?  Or no, no, no, he got it.  Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo.  Mo's son wants to fly.  He got the thing.  So if I want to go, I just got to call him and I go from Republic, uh, airport.  Yeah.  You obviously want to.  Tell you when you go, bring one of the MIT kids that they don't know and he'll signal  you.  They, they obviously.  I'm going to hear this.  They obviously, they listen by the way.  No, they do.  No, I love Mohegan.  They obviously want their money back, but...  No, that's what they'll do.  If you have a big win, a couple big wins,  that private jet's going to come and get you  and bring you back  because they know the odds are eventually in your favor.  Oh, of course. 
[03:31:30]  And also, when you do stuff like that,  you feel kind of obligated to play  the whole time you're there.  Like, I've gotten...  When you get the free mega suite,  you can't just, like, hang out.  Oh, with the host and everything.  The host is taking you around.  The host takes you around  and shows you the entire place,  even though you've been there a splendid time.  So they know psychologically.  It's all a psychological game.  This is going to affect you.  You're like, fuck, they gave me the private jet,  the champagne, the champagne, the nice...  And you end up losing 20 grand,  which you could have paid for the private jet yourself.  Right, right.  But, I mean, no, you know what?  That's interesting.  Listen, if you're going to gamble anyways,  then definitely take advantage of all the comps.  Oh, yeah.  Hell yeah.  But, you know, yeah. 
[03:32:00]  No, that's awesome.  I knew the guy...  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  I knew the guy, this guy, RJ,  who was the high roller in the Paris.  He was...  I watched him gamble.  He was doing...  I think he was up...  Like, he wound up winning 5 million or something.  I mean, he was up...  Seriously.  On a blackjack.  Well, he was playing, like, maybe it was...  I want to say $30,000, like, at a time.  And he was tapping the table.  He was a psychopath from Philadelphia.  Yeah.  And he had, like, $40,000 in comps.  I mean, it was amazing how badly they wanted to keep him. 
[03:32:30]  And he was unbeatable.  And they finally...  I think Caesars owns that as well.  And they finally got a little bit of their money back,  a couple of million back from him,  and they banned him.  They got some of the money back,  and they said, fuck you out.  Yeah, some casinos...  If you're on a ridiculous winning streak,  they'll just say, you know what?  I don't want your action anymore.  Man.  And it's weird, because obviously it's luck,  and yet they just get nervous,  because a high roller like that  can ruin their bottom line for the month.  He was fucking...  Yeah, kicking him out isn't going to hurt you.  People aren't going to go,  I'm not going to that casino.  They kick the people out.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  He was, at one point, 
[03:33:00]  I was watching him,  he was down $200,000,  and then he went back up,  and he won, like, $215,000.  It's all relative, by the way.  Yeah.  It's all relative.  The guy that goes in there  and just plays $25,  when he hits a blackjack,  it's, you know,  the same as the guy that's playing  hundreds of dollars to him,  if you can afford it.  I mean, if it's within your means.  That's why people go, like,  who the fuck is winning $5 million?  Well, the guy that's winning $5 million  is the guy that's betting  $100,000 on a hand, you know? 
[03:33:30]  It definitely is.  When you're sitting there, though,  and you're playing three spots  on a $6,000 max table,  and then you're,  now you've got to double down  on this one,  or split, split again,  double down,  and you're just looking going,  I better fucking win this hand.  What's the biggest bet you've placed?  Probably, with everything,  with splits and doubles,  I think the biggest hand,  single hand,  or turn,  because I was playing multiple hands, 
[03:34:00]  was probably $30,000.  That's pretty nuts.  Which was nuts.  Yeah, nuts.  And that one, I did win.  You could buy a car.  You know, it's like a car.  Yeah, it's a car sitting up on the table.  That one, I did win.  There were a couple of,  you know, when you bet max.  Do you do, like, a progressive  where you raise your bet  every time you win,  or you raise your bet?  Not every time.  It's, I'll, believe it or not,  I'll be pretty conservative,  especially when I first start  and feel it out.  Yeah.  You know, I don't care  what people say about,  it's just this or that  or the other thing.  A bad shoe is a bad fucking shoe.  Yeah.  And you don't play it. 
[03:34:30]  Right.  So I'll wait, I'll hang out,  and then I'll start,  you know, if the dealer  goes into a slump  where they're busting a lot,  I'll start upping my bet  a little bit.  Yeah.  Pull back, you know.  Sometimes you pull back  and hit a blackjack.  Yeah.  Sometimes you bet your big bet  and there it goes.  It goes bye-bye.  But I don't,  you gotta play sensibly  and in it for the long haul.  Right.  The guys that sit there  and they start losing  and then plop down  all their money  to try to make it back  in one shot,  you're done.  If you plan on staying there 
[03:35:00]  for like 18 hours,  you might have a chance.  I mean, the biggest mistake  people make is coming  with too small a bankroll.  Yeah.  And I know casinos love me  to say that,  but it's true.  If you sit down  at a $100 table  with $1,000,  you're gonna reach ruin  before you reach money.  You have to have  like 100 times  your minimum bet.  That's what they say  safely to have.  So if you're betting  10 bucks a hand,  you gotta sit down  with $1,000.  You know,  if you're betting  $100 a hand,  you gotta be sitting there  with 10 grand.  I always say,  you gotta have enough money  where you can keep  your ass in the seat  that happens for you. 
[03:35:30]  Right.  And, you know,  it's not gonna happen  right away.  Right.  It's gonna be the ups  and downs, ups and downs.  Yeah.  Listen, I hate to do this,  but we have a train of cash.  We were supposed  to leave 20 minutes ago.  Kenny said to us,  could you please  end the show  at 10 o'clock?  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, dude,  you gotta come back.  That's how good you are, Ben.  We were supposed  to leave around 10 to 10, 15.  Look at me.  I'm all like revved up  and excited.  I know.  We can easily go another.  We'll have to have you back  soon to continue this.  I want to read  every one of these  fucking books, man.  That Yakuza book,  I'll read.  Hey, congrats on your book, too, man. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, thank you.  Flying up there.  Thanks, man.  Jimmy, start with  Bring Down the House.  It's an amazing book.  I read that, actually.  That one I have.  Oh, you did read that?  I'll make sure it was  the one I thought of  when they were walking  through the...  I'm gonna read  Ugly Americans now.  Oh, yeah.  That's the only one  I haven't read.  It's good.  It's a fun one.  Well, rigged.  You haven't read Rigged?  And Rigged.  Well, it just came out.  Actually, I'm gonna bring  this on the train  with me today.  Oh, good.  I'll start it.  Yeah, maybe I'll see you  on the train.  Rigged by Ben Misrich  and it is out now  and he's obviously  a bestseller.  Spell his last name.  M-E-Z-R-I-C-H. 
[03:36:30]  We're gonna be late.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Ben Misrich,  M-E-Z-R-I-C-H.  No, I'm saying it  kind of phonetically.  R-I-C-H.com  is his website  if you forget  the book titles  because they all  look fucking great  and they're all  non-fiction, correct?  Yeah, two stories.  We gotta end this  only because these guys  have a train to catch.  Yeah, unfortunately.  Yep.  All right, man.  It's called Rigged.  Line of the Day  brought to you  by BodogFantasy.net.
